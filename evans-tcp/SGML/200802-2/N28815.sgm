<P>HAIL, &s;weet a&s;ylum of my infancy! Content and innocence re&s;ide beneath your humble roof, and charity unboa&s;tful of the good it renders. Hail, ye ve|nerable trees! my happie&s;t hours of childi&s;h gaiety were pa&s;t beneath your &s;helter&mdash;then, carele&s;s as the birds that &s;ung upon your boughs, I laughed the hours away, nor knew of evil.</P>
<P>Here &s;urely I &s;hall be guarded from duplicity; and if not happy, at lea&s;t in &s;ome degree tranquil. Here unmole&s;ted may I wait, till the rude &s;torm of &s;orrow is overblown, and my father's arms are again expand|ed to receive me.</P>
<P>Such were the words of Amanda, as the chai&s;e (which &s;he had hired at a neighbouring village on quitting the mail) turned down a little verdant lane, almo&s;t darken|ed by old trees, who&s;e interwoven branches allowed her &s;carcely a glimp&s;e of her nur&s;e's cottage, till &s;he had reached the door.</P>
<P>A number of tender recollections ru&s;hing upon her mind, rendered her almo&s;t unable to alight; but the
<PB N="6" REF="038416_0005_1011E130EA3BFF18">
nur&s;e and her hu&s;band, who had been impatiently watch|ing for the arrival of their fondling, a&s;&s;i&s;ted her; and the former, obeying the dictates of nature and affec|tion, half &s;tifled her with care&s;&s;es; the latter re&s;pect|fully ki&s;&s;ed her hand, and dropt a tear of unutterable joy upon it. Lort, he &s;aid, he was &s;urpri&s;ed to be &s;ure, at the alteration a few years had made in her per&s;on&mdash;Why, it &s;eemed to him as if it was only the other day &s;ince he had carried her about in his arms, quite a little fairy. Then he begged to know how his tear old cap|tain was, and Mr. O&s;car&mdash;and whether the latter was not grown a very fine youth. Amanda, &s;miling through her tears, endeavoured to an&s;wer his enquiries; but &s;he was &s;o much affected by her feelings, as to be &s;carcely able to &s;peak; and when, by her de&s;ire, he went out to di&s;charge the chai&s;e, and a&s;&s;i&s;t the young man (who had travelled with her from London) to bring in her luggage, her head &s;unk upon her nur&s;e's bo&s;om, who&s;e arms encircled her wai&s;t. "My dear faithful nur&s;e," &s;he &s;obbed, "your poor child is again returned to &s;eek an a&s;ylum from you."&mdash;"And &s;he is heartily welcome," replied the good creature, crying her&s;elf, "and I have taken care to have every thing &s;o nice, and &s;o tidy, and &s;o comfortable, that I warrant you the greate&s;t laty in the land need not di&s;dain your apartments; and here are two little girls, as well as my&s;elf, that will always be ready to attend, and &s;erve, and obey you. This is El|len, your own fo&s;ter &s;i&s;ter; and this is Bet&s;y, the little thing I had in the cradle when you went away&mdash;and I have be&s;ides, though I &s;ay it my&s;elf, that &s;hould not &s;ay it, two as fine lads as you could wi&s;h to &s;ee: they are now at work at a farmer's hard by; but they will be here pre&s;ently. Thank Cot, we are all happy, though obliged to earn our own bread; but 'tis &s;weeter for that rea&s;on, &s;ince labour gives us health to enjoy it, and con|tentment ble&s;&s;es us all." Amanda affectionately em|braced the two girls, who were the pictures of health and cheerfulne&s;s, and was then conducted into a little parlour, which, with a &s;mall bed-chamber adjoining it, was appropriated to her u&s;e. The neatne&s;s of the room
<PB N="7" REF="038416_0006_1011E1338CC42488">
was truly plea&s;ing; the floor was nicely &s;anded; the hearth was dre&s;t with "flowers and fennel gay;" and the chimney-piece adorned with a range of broken tea|cups, "wi&s;ely kept for &s;hew;" a clock ticked behind the door; and an ebony cupboard di&s;played a profu&s;ion of the &s;howye&s;t ware the country could produce.</P>
<P>And now the nur&s;e, on "ho&s;pitable thought intent," hurried from Amanda to prepare her dinner. The chick|en, as &s;he &s;aid her&s;elf, was ready to pop down in a mi|nute; Ellen tied the a&s;paragus, and Bet&s;y laid the cloth; Edwin drew his be&s;t cyder, and having brought it in him&s;elf, retired to entertain his gue&s;t in the kitch|en, (Amanda's travelling companion) before whom he had already &s;et &s;ome of his mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial fare.</P>
<P>Dinner, in the opinion of Amanda, was &s;erved in a moment; but her heart was too full to eat, though pre&s;|&s;ed to do &s;o with the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s; a tenderne&s;s which in truth was the means of overcoming her.</P>
<P>When in&s;ulted by malice, or oppre&s;&s;ed by cruelty, the heart can a&s;&s;ume a &s;tern fortitude foreign to its nature; but this &s;eeming apathy vani&s;hes at the voice of kind|ne&s;s, as the rigid fro&s;t of winter melts before the gentle influence of the &s;un; and tears, gu&s;hing tears of grati|tude and &s;en&s;ibility expre&s;s its yielding feelings. Sa|cred are &s;uch tears; they flow from the &s;weet &s;ource of &s;ocial affection: the good alone can &s;hed them.</P>
<P>Her nur&s;e's &s;ons &s;oon returned from their labour; two fine nut-brown youths. They had been the companions of her infant &s;ports, and &s;he &s;poke to them with the mo&s;t engaging affability.</P>
<P>Dome&s;tic bli&s;s and rural felicity Amanda had always been accu&s;tomed to, till within a &s;hort period; her at|tachment to them was &s;till as &s;trong as ever; and had her father been with her, &s;he would have been happy.</P>
<P>It was now about the middle of June, and the whole country was glowing with luxuriant beauty. The cot|tage was in reality a comfortable, commodious farm|hou&s;e; it was &s;ituated in North Wales, and the roman|tic &s;cenery &s;urrounding it was highly plea&s;ing to a di&s;|po&s;ition like Amanda's, which delighted equally in the
<PB N="8" REF="038416_0007_1011E13519498E78">
&s;ublime and beautiful. The front of the cottage was almo&s;t covered with woodbine, intermingled with vines; and the lane already mentioned, formed a &s;ha|dy avenue up to the very door; one &s;ide overlooked a deep valley, winding among&s;t hills clad in the livelie&s;t verdure; a clear &s;tream, running through it, turned a mill in its cour&s;e, and afforded a &s;alutary coolne&s;s to the herds which ruminated on its banks; the other &s;ide commanded a view of rich pa&s;tures, terminated by a thick grove, who&s;e natural vi&s;tas gave a view of culti|vated farms, a &s;mall irregular village, the &s;pire of its church, and a fine old ca&s;tle, who&s;e &s;tately turrets ro&s;e above the trees &s;urrounding them.</P>
<P>The farm yard, at the back of the cottage, was &s;tock|ed with poultry, and all the implements of rural indu&s;|try; the garden was divided from it by a rude paling, in|terwoven with honey &s;uckles and wild ro&s;es; the part ap|propriated for vegetables divided from the part &s;acred to Flora by rows of fruit trees; a craggy precipice hung over it, covered with purple and yellow flowers, thyme and other odoriferous herbs, which afforded browzage to three or four goats that &s;kipped about in playful gambols; a &s;ilver &s;tream trickled down the precipice, and winding round a plantation of &s;hrubs, fell with a gentle murmur into the valley. Beneath a projecting fragment of the rock a natural rece&s;s was formed, thick|ly lined with mo&s;s, and planted round with a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of beautiful flowers.</P>

<P>Of tho&s;e &s;cenes Amanda had but an imperfect recol|lection; &s;uch a faint idea as we retain of a confu&s;ed but agreeable dream, which, though we cannot explain, leaves a plea&s;ing impre&s;&s;ion behind.</P>
<P>Peculiar circum&s;tances had driven her from the &s;helter of a parent's arms, to &s;eek &s;ecurity in retirement at this
<PB N="9" REF="038416_0008_1011E136D449F458">
abode of &s;implicity and peace. Here the perturbation of fear &s;ub&s;ided; but the &s;oft melancholy of her &s;oul at times was heightened, when &s;he reflected, that in this very place an unfortunate mother had expired almo&s;t at the moment of giving her birth.</P>
<P>Amanda was now about nineteen; a de&s;cription of her face and per&s;on would not do her ju&s;tice, as it never could convey a full idea of the ineffable &s;weetne&s;s and &s;en&s;ibility of the former, or the &s;triking elegance and beautiful proportion of the latter.</P>
<P>Sorrow had faded her vived bloom: for the di&s;tre&s;|&s;es of her father weighed heavy on her heart, and the blo&s;&s;om drooped with the tree that &s;upported it. Her agonized parent witne&s;&s;ing this &s;udden change, &s;ent her into Wales, as much for health as for &s;ecurity; &s;he was ordered goat's whey and gentle exerci&s;e; but &s;he firmly believed, that con&s;olation on her father's account could alone effect a cure.</P>
<P>Though the ro&s;e upon her check was pale, and the lu&s;tre of her eyes was fled, &s;he was from tho&s;e circum|&s;tances (if le&s;s dazzling to the eye) more affecting to the heart. Cold and unfeeling indeed mu&s;t that one have been, which could &s;ee her unmoved: for her's was that intere&s;ting face and figure, which had power to fix the wandering eye, and change the gaze of admiration into the throb of &s;en&s;ibility; nor was her mind inferior to the form that en&s;hrined it.</P>
<P>She now exerted her &s;pirits in gratitude to her humble but benevolent friends. Her arrival had occa&s;ioned a little fe&s;tival at the cottage: the tea-things, which were kept more for &s;how than u&s;e in the ebony cupboard, were now taken out, and carried by her de&s;ire to the rece&s;s in the garden; whither Mrs. Edwin followed the family with a hot cake, Amanda thought large enough to &s;erve half the principality.</P>
<P>The &s;cene was delightful, and well calculated to ba|ni&s;h all &s;adne&s;s but de&s;pair; Amanda was therefore cheered: for &s;he was too much the child of pity ever to have felt its baneful influence. In the mid&s;t of her troubles &s;he &s;till looked up with humble confidence to
<PB N="10" REF="038416_0009_1011E13973E4FD08">
that Power, who has promi&s;ed never to for&s;ake the righteous.</P>
<P>The harmle&s;s je&s;t, the jocund laugh went round, and Amanda enjoyed the innocent gaiety; for a benevolent mind will ever derive plea&s;ure from the happine&s;s of others. The declining &s;un now gave &s;ofter beauties to the exten&s;ive &s;cenery; the lowing of the cattle was faintly echoed by the neighbouring hills; the cheerful carol of the pea&s;ant floated on the evening gale, that &s;tole perfumes from beds of flowers, and wafted them around; the bu&s;y bees had now completed the delicious labour of the day, and with ince&s;&s;ant humming &s;ought their various hives, while
<Q><L>Every cop&s;e</L>
<L>Deep-tangled, tree irregular, and bu&s;h</L>
<L>Were prodigal of harmony.</L>
<BIBL>THOMSON.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>To complete the concert, a blind harper, who &s;up|ported him&s;elf by &s;ummer rambles through the coun|try, &s;troled into the garden; and after a plentiful repa&s;t of bread and chee&s;e, and nut brown ale, began playing.</P>
<P>The venerable appearance of the mu&s;ician, the &s;im|ple melody of his harp, recalled to Amanda's recollection the tales of other times, in which &s;he had &s;o often de|lighted; it &s;ent her &s;oul back to the ages of old, to the days of other years, when bards rehear&s;ed the exploits of heroes, and &s;ung the prai&s;es of the dead. "While the gho&s;ts of tho&s;e they &s;ung, came in their ru&s;tling winds, and were &s;een to bend with joy towards the &s;ound of their prai&s;e." To proceed in the beautiful language of O&s;&s;ian, the &s;ound was mournful and low, like the &s;ong of the tomb; &s;uch as Fingal heard when the crowded &s;ighs of his bo&s;om ro&s;e; and, "&s;ome of my heroes are low," &s;aid the grey haired king of Morven: "I hear the &s;ound of death on the harp. O&s;&s;ian, touch the trem|bling &s;tring. Bid the &s;orrow ri&s;e, that their &s;pirits may fly with joy to Morven's woody hills." He touched the harp before the king: the &s;ound was mournful and low.</P>
<P>"Bend forwards from your clouds," he &s;aid, "gho&s;ts
<PB N="11" REF="038416_0010_1011E13D6FAD8548">
of my fathers bend. Lay by the red terror of your cour&s;e. Receive the falling chief; whether he comes from a di&s;tant land, or ri&s;es from the rolling &s;ea, let his robe of mi&s;t be near; his &s;pear, that is formed of a cloud, place an half-extingui&s;hed meteor by his &s;ide, in the form of the hero's &s;word. And, oh! let his countenance be lovely, that his friends may delight in his pre&s;ence. Bend from your clouds," he &s;aid, "gho&s;ts of my fa|thers, bend."</P>
<P>The &s;weet enthu&s;ia&s;m which aro&s;e in Amanda's mind from her pre&s;ent &s;ituation her careful nur&s;e &s;oon put an end to, by reminding her of the heavy dew then falling. Amanda could have &s;taid for hours in the garden; but re&s;igning her inclination to her nur&s;e's, &s;he immediately accompanied her into the hou&s;e. She &s;oon felt inclined to retire to re&s;t; and after a &s;light &s;upper of &s;trawberries and cream, (which was all they could prevail on her to touch) &s;he withdrew to her chamber, attended by the nur&s;e and her two daughters, who all thought their &s;er|vices requi&s;ite; and it was not without much difficulty Amanda per&s;uaded them to the contrary.</P>
<P>Left to &s;olitude, a tender awe &s;tole upon the mind of Amanda, when &s;he reflected, that in this very room her mother had expired. The recollection of her &s;ufferings, the &s;orrows her father and &s;elf had experienced &s;ince the period of her death, the di&s;tre&s;&s;es they &s;till felt and might yet go through, all rai&s;ed a &s;udden agony in her &s;oul, and tears bur&s;t forth, &s;he went to the bed, and knelt be&s;ide it. "Oh! my mother," &s;he cried, "if thy departed &s;pirit is permitted to look down upon this world, hear and regard the &s;upplications of thy child, for thy protection amid&s;t the &s;nares which may be &s;pread for her. Yet," continued &s;he after a pau&s;e, "that Being, who has taken thee to him&s;elf, will, if I continue inno|cent, extend his guardian care; to Him therefore, to Him be rai&s;ed the fervent prayer for rendering abortive every &s;cheme of treachery."</P>
<P>She prayed with all the fervency of devotion; her wandering thoughts were all re&s;trained, and her pa&s;&s;ions gradually &s;ub&s;ided into a calm.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="038416_0011_1011E13F010DA740">
Warmed by a pure and ardent piety, that &s;acred pow|er which comes with healing on its wings to the afflicted children of humanity, &s;he felt a placid hope &s;pring in her heart, that whi&s;pered to it, all would yet be well.</P>
<P>She ro&s;e tranquil and animated. The inhabitants of the cottage had retired to repo&s;e; and &s;he heard no &s;ound &s;ave the ticking of the clock from the out&s;ide room. She went to the window, and rai&s;ing the white calico curtain, looked down the valley; it was illumin|ed by the beams of the moon, which tipt the trees with a &s;hadowy &s;ilver, and threw a line of radiance on the clear rivulet. All was &s;till, as if creation &s;lept upon the bo&s;om of &s;erenity. Here, while contemplating the &s;cene, a &s;udden flutter at the window &s;tartled her; and &s;he &s;aw in a moment after a bird flit acro&s;s, and perch on a tree who&s;e boughs &s;haded the ca&s;ement: a &s;oft &s;erenade was immediately begun by the &s;weet and plaintive bird of night.</P>
<P>Amanda at length dropt the curtain, and &s;ought repo&s;e; it &s;oon ble&s;t her eye-lids, and &s;hed a &s;weet obli|vion over all her cares.</P>

<P>FITZALAN, the father of Amanda, was the de&s;cendant of an ancient Iri&s;h family, which had how|ever, unfortunately, attained the &s;ummit of its pro&s;peri|ty long before his entrance into life; &s;o that little more than the name, once dignified by illu&s;trious actions, was left to its po&s;terity. The parents of Fitzalan were &s;up|ported by an employment under government, which en|abled them to &s;ave a &s;mall &s;um for their &s;on, and only child, who at an early period became its &s;ole ma&s;ter, by their dying within a &s;hort period of each other. As &s;oon as he had in &s;ome degree recovered the &s;hock of &s;uch calamities, he laid out his little pittance in the purcha&s;e of a commi&s;&s;ion, as a profe&s;&s;ion be&s;t &s;uiting his inclina|tions and finances.</P>
<P>The war between America and France had then ju&s;t commenced; and Fitzalan's regiment was among&s;t the fir&s;t forces &s;ent to the aid of the former. The &s;cenes of war, tho' dreadfully affecting to a &s;oul of exqui&s;ite &s;en|&s;ibility, &s;uch as he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, had not power to damp the ardour of his &s;pirit: for with the name, he inherited the hardy re&s;olution of his progenitors.</P>
<P>He had once the good fortune to &s;ave the life of a Briti&s;h &s;oldier: he was one of a &s;mall party, who, by the treachery of their guides, were &s;uddenly &s;urpri&s;ed in a wood, through which they were obliged to pa&s;s, to join
<PB N="14" REF="038416_0013_1011E145582AD038">
another detachment of the army. Their only way in this alarming exigence was to retreat to the fort from whence they had but lately i&s;&s;ued; encompa&s;&s;ed as they were by the enemy, this was not atchieved without the greate&s;t difficulty. Ju&s;t as they had reached it, Fitzalan &s;aw far behind them a poor &s;oldier, who had been woun|ded at the fir&s;t on&s;et, ju&s;t overtaken by two Indians. Yielding to the impul&s;e of compa&s;&s;ion in which all idea of &s;elf was lo&s;t, Fitzalan ha&s;tily turned to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and flinging him&s;elf between the pur&s;ued and the pur&s;u|ers, he kept them at bay till the poor creature had reach|ed a place of &s;afety. This action, performed at the im|minent hazard of his life, &s;ecured him the la&s;ting grati|tude of the &s;oldier, who&s;e name was Edwin; the &s;ame that now afforded an a&s;ylum to his daughter.</P>
<P>Edwin had committed &s;ome juvenile indi&s;cretions, which highly incen&s;ed his parents: in de&s;pair at incur|ring their re&s;entment, he enli&s;ted with a recruiting party in their neighbourhood; but accu&s;tomed all his life to peace and plenty, he did not by any means reli&s;h his new &s;ituation. His gratitude to Fitzalan was unbounded; he con&s;idered him as the pre&s;erver of his life; and, on the man's being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, who had hitherto attend|ed him as a &s;ervant, entreated he might be taken in his place. This entreaty Fitzalan complied with; he was plea&s;ed with Edwin's manner; and, having heard the little hi&s;tory of his misfortunes, promi&s;ed on their return to Europe, to intercede with his friends for him.</P>
<P>During his &s;tay abroad, Fitzalan was promoted to a captain-lieutenancy: his pay was his only &s;upport, which of nece&s;&s;ity checked his benevolence of &s;pirit "open as day to melting charity."</P>
<P>On the regiment's return to Europe, he obtained Ed|win's di&s;charge, who longed to re-enter upon his former mode of life. He accompanied the penitent him&s;elf in|to Wales, where he was received with the true&s;t rapture.</P>
<P>In grief for his lo&s;s, his parents had forgotten all re|&s;entment for his errors, which indeed had never been ve|ry great: they had lo&s;t their two remaining children du|ring his ab&s;ence, and now received him as the &s;ole com|fort and hope of their age.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="038416_0014_1011E147B96924C0">
His youthful protector was ble&s;t with the warme&s;t gratitude; tears filled his fine eyes, as he beheld the plea&s;ure of the parents, and contrition of the &s;on; and he departed with that heart-felt plea&s;ure, which ever attends and rewards, an action of humanity.</P>
<P>He now accompanied his regiment into Scotland: they were quartered at a fort in a remote part of that kingdom.</P>
<P>Near the fort was a fine old abbey belonging to the family of Dunreath; the high hills which nearly encom|pa&s;&s;ed it, were almo&s;t all covered with trees, who&s;e dark &s;hades gave the appearance of gloomy &s;olitude to the building.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, the Earl of Dunreath, was now far advanced in life: twice had he married, in expecta|tion of a male heir to his large e&s;tates, and twice had he been di&s;appointed. His fir&s;t lady had expired immedi|ately after the birth of a daughter. She had taken un|der her protection a young female, who by unexpected vici&s;&s;itudes of her family, was left de&s;titute of &s;upport. On the demi&s;e of her patrone&s;s, &s;he retired from the ab|bey to the hou&s;e of a kin&s;woman in its vicinity: the Earl of Dunreath, accu&s;tomed to her &s;ociety, felt his &s;olitude doubly augmented by her ab&s;ence. He had ever followed the dictates of inclination, and would not di&s;obey them now: ere the term of mourning was ex|pired, he offered his hand, and was accepted.</P>
<P>The fair orphan, now triumphant mi&s;tre&s;s of the ab|bey, found there was no longer occa&s;ion to check her natural propen&s;ities. Her &s;oul was vain, unfeeling, and ambitious; and the &s;udden elevation broke down all bar|riers which prudence had hitherto oppo&s;ed to her pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>She &s;oon gained an ab&s;olute a&s;cendency over her lord&mdash;&s;he knew how to a&s;&s;ume the &s;mile of complacence, and the accent of &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>Forgetful of the kindne&s;s of her late patrone&s;s, &s;he treated the infant &s;he had left, with the cruele&s;t neglect; a neglect, which was, if po&s;&s;ible, increa&s;ed, on the birth of her own daughter, as &s;he could not bear that Augu&s;|ta, (in&s;tead of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the whole) &s;hould only &s;hare
<PB N="16" REF="038416_0015_1011E14949B050F0">
the affection and e&s;tates of her father. She contrived by degrees to alienate the former from the innocent Malvi|na; and &s;he tru&s;ted &s;he &s;hould yet find means to deprive her of the latter.</P>
<P>Terrified by violence, and depre&s;&s;ed by &s;everity, the child looked dejected and unhappy: and this appear|ance, Lady Dunreath made the Earl believe, proceeded from &s;ulkine&s;s and natural ill humour. Her own child, unre&s;trained in any wi&s;h of her heart, was, from her playful, gaiety, a con&s;tant &s;ource of amu&s;ement to the Earl; her mother had taken care to in&s;truct her in all the little endearments, which, when united with infantine &s;weetne&s;s, allure almo&s;t imperceptibly the affections.</P>
<P>Malvina, ere &s;he knew the meaning of &s;orrow, thus became its prey: but in &s;pite of envy or ill treatment &s;he grew up with all the graces of mind and form, that had di&s;tingui&s;hed her mother: her air was at once ele|gant and commanding; her face replete with &s;weetne&s;s; and her fine eyes had a mixture of &s;en&s;ibility and lan|gour in them, which &s;poke to the feeling &s;oul.</P>
<P>Augu&s;ta was al&s;o a fine figure; but unpo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the winning graces of elegance and mode&s;ty, which adorn|ed her &s;i&s;ter, her form always appeared decorated with the mo&s;t &s;tudied art, and her large eyes had a confident a&s;&s;urance in them, that &s;eemed to expect and demand univer&s;al homage.</P>
<P>The warriors of the fort were welcome vi&s;itants at the Abbey, which lady Dunreath contrived to render a &s;cene of almo&s;t con&s;tant gaiety, by keeping up a con|tinual intercour&s;e with all the adjacent families, and en|tertaining all the &s;trangers who came into its neighbour|hood.</P>
<P>Lord Dunreath had long been a prey to infirmities, which at this period generally confined him to his room; but though his body was debilitated, his mind retained all its active powers.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t appearance of the officers at the Abbey was at a ball given by lady Dunreath, in con&s;equence of their arrival near it; the gothic apartments were decorated, and lighted up with a &s;plendor that at once di&s;played ta&s;te
<PB N="17" REF="038416_0016_1011E14B0432C888">
and magnificence; the lights, the mu&s;ic, the brilliancy and unu&s;al gaiety of the company, all gave to the &s;pirits of Malvina an agreeable flutter they had never before experienced; and a brighter bloom than u&s;ual &s;tole ov'r her lovely cheek.</P>
<P>The young co-heire&s;&s;es were extremely admired by the military heroes. Malvina as the elde&s;t, opened the ball with the colonel; her form had attracted the eyes of Fitzalan, and vainly he attempted to withdraw them, till the lively conver&s;ation of Augu&s;ta who honoured him with her hand, forced him to re&s;train his glances, and pay her the &s;prightly attention &s;o generally expected&mdash;when he came to turn to Malvina, he involuntarily de|tained her hand for a moment; &s;he blu&s;hed and the tim|ed beam that &s;tole from her half-averted eyes, agitated his whole &s;oul.</P>
<P>Partners were changed in the cour&s;e of the evening, and he &s;eized the fir&s;t opportunity that offered, for en|gaging her: the &s;oftne&s;s of her voice, the &s;implicity yet elegance of her language, now captivated his heart, as much as her form had charmed his eyes.</P>
<P>Never had he before &s;een an object he thought half &s;o lovely or engaging; with her he could not &s;upport that lively &s;train of conver&s;ation he had done with her &s;i&s;ter. Where the heart is much intere&s;ted, it will not admit of trifling.</P>
<P>Fitzalan was now in the meredian of manhood; his &s;tature was above the common &s;ize, and elegance and dignity were con&s;picuous in it; his features were regular|ly hand&s;ome, and the fairne&s;s of his forehead proved what his complection had been, till change of climate and hard&s;hip had embrowned it; the expre&s;&s;ion of his coun|tenance was &s;omewhat plaintive; his eyes had a &s;weet|ne&s;s in them, that &s;poke a &s;oul of the tendere&s;t feel|ings; and the &s;mile that played around his mouth would have adorned a face of female beauty.</P>
<P>When the dance with lady Malvina was over, Lady Augu&s;ta took care for the remainder of the evening to engro&s;s all his attention. She thought him by far the hand&s;ome&s;t man in the room, and gave him no oppor|tunity
<PB N="18" REF="038416_0017_1011E14D8C4EC5A8">
of avoiding her; gallantry obliged him to return her a&s;&s;iduities, and he was by his brother officers &s;et down in the li&s;t of her adorers. This mi&s;take he en|couraged; he could bear raillery on an indifferent &s;ub|ject; and joined in the mirth, which the idea of his laying &s;iege to the young heire&s;s occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P>He deluded him&s;elf with no fal&s;e hopes relative to the real object of his pa&s;&s;ion; he knew the ob&s;tacles be|tween them were in&s;uperable; but his heart was too proud to complain of fate: he &s;hook off all appearance of melancholy, and &s;eemed more animated than ever.</P>
<P>His vi&s;its at the Abbey became con&s;tant; Lady Au|gu&s;ta took them to her&s;elf, and encouraged his atten|tions: as her mother rendered her perfect mi&s;tre&s;s of her own actions, &s;he had generally a levee of red coats eve|ry morning in her dre&s;&s;ing room. Lady Malvina &s;eldom appeared; &s;he was at tho&s;e times almo&s;t always employ|ed in reading to her father; when that was not the ca&s;e, her own favourite avocations often detained her in her room; or el&s;e &s;he wandered out, about the romantic <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> on the &s;ea-&s;hore; &s;he delighted in &s;olitary ram|bles, and loved to vi&s;it the old pea&s;ants, who told her tales of her departed mother's goodne&s;s; drawing tears of &s;orrow from her eyes, at the irreparable lo&s;s &s;he had &s;u&s;tained by her death.</P>
<P>Fitzalan went one morning as u&s;ual to the Abbey to pay his cu&s;tomary vi&s;it: as he went through the gal|lery which led to Lady Augu&s;ta's dre&s;&s;ing-room, his eyes were caught by two beautiful portraits of the Earl's daughters; an arti&s;t, by his expre&s;s de&s;ire, had come to the Abbey to draw them; they were ju&s;t fini&s;hed, and that morning placed in the gallery.</P>
<P>Lady Augu&s;ta appeared negligently reclined upon a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ofa, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n a verdant alcove; the flowing drapery of the loo&s;e robe in which &s;he was habited, &s;et off her fine figure; little cupids were &s;een fanning a&s;ide her dark-brown hair, and &s;trewing ro&s;es on her pillow.</P>
<P>Lady Malvina was repre&s;ented in the &s;imple attire of a pea&s;ant girl, leaning on a little gra&s;&s;y hillock who&s;e foot was wa&s;hed by a clear &s;tream; while her flock brow&s;ed
<PB N="19" REF="038416_0018_1011E15159411A68">
around, and her dog re&s;ted beneath the &s;hade of an old tree, that waved its branches over her head, and &s;eemed to &s;helter her from the beams of the meredian &s;un.</P>
<P>"Beautiful portrait," cried Fitzalam, "&s;weet re&s;em|blance of a &s;eraphic form."</P>
<P>He heard a &s;oft &s;igh behind him; he &s;tarted, turned, and perceived. Lady Malvina; in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion he faultered o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t his admiration of the pictures, and not knowing what he did, fixed his eyes on Lady Augu&s;ta's, exclaiming, "How beautiful."&mdash;"'Tis very hand&s;ome indeed," &s;aid Malvina, with a more pen&s;ive voice than u&s;ual, and led the way to her &s;i&s;ters dre&s;&s;ing-room.</P>
<P>Lady Augu&s;ta was &s;pangling &s;ome ribbon; but at Fitzalan's entrance &s;he threw it a&s;ide, and a&s;ked him if he had been admiring her picture. Yes he &s;aid, 'twas that alone had prevented his before paying his homage to the original. He proceeded in a &s;train of compliments, which had more gallantry than &s;incerity in them. In the cour&s;e of their trifling, he &s;natched a knot of the &s;pangled ribbon, and pinning it next hit heart, declared it &s;hould remain there as a tali&s;man again&s;t all future impre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>He &s;tole a glance at Lady Malvina, &s;he held a book in her hand; but her eyes were turned towards him, and a deadly palene&s;s over&s;pread her countenance.</P>
<P>Fitzalan's &s;pirits vani&s;hed; he &s;tarted up and declared he mu&s;t be gone immediately. The dejection of Lady Malvina dwelt upon his heart; it flattered its fondne&s;s but pained its &s;en&s;ibility. He le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t the fort in the evening, immediately after he had retired from the me&s;s, he &s;trol|led, to the &s;ea-&s;ide, and rambled a con&s;iderable way among the rocks. The &s;cene was wild and &s;olemn; the &s;hadows of evening were beginning to de&s;cend; the waves &s;tole with low murmurs upon the &s;hore, and a &s;oft breeze gen|tly agitated the marine plants that grew among&s;t the cre|vices of the rocks; already were the &s;ea fowl, with har&s;h and melancholy cries, flocking to their ne&s;ts, &s;ome lightly &s;kimming over the &s;urface of the water, while others were &s;een, like dark clouds ri&s;ing from the long heath of the neighbouring hills. Fitzalan pur&s;ued his way in deep and melancholy meditation, from which a

plaintive Sco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ch air, &s;ung by the melting voice of har|mony it&s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ou&s;ed him. He looked towards the &s;pot from whence the &s;ound proceeded, and beheld Lady Malvina &s;tanding on a low rock, a projection of it afford|ing her &s;upport. Nothing could be more picture&s;que, than her appearance; &s;he looked like one of the beautiful forms, which O&s;&s;ian &s;o often de&s;cribes; her white dre&s;s fluttered in the wind, and her dark hair hung di&s;hevel|led around her. Fitzalan moved &s;oftly, and &s;topt behind her; &s;he wept as &s;he &s;ung, and wiped away her tears as &s;he cea&s;ed &s;inging: &s;he &s;ighed heavily. "Ah my mother," &s;he exclaimed, "why was Malvina left behind you?"</P>
<P>"To ble&s;s and improve mankind," cried Fitzalan," She &s;creamed and would have fallen, had he not caught her in his arms: he prevailed on her to &s;it down upon the rock, and allow him to &s;upport her, till her agitation had &s;ub&s;ided. "And why," (cried he) "&s;hould Lady Mal|vina give way to melancholy, ble&s;t as &s;he is with all that can render life de&s;irable; Why &s;eek its indulgence, by rambling about tho&s;e dreary rocks, fit haunts alone, he might have added, for wretchedne&s;s and me? Can I help wondering at your dejection," (continued he) "when to all appearance (at lea&s;t) I &s;ee you po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every thing requi&s;ite to con&s;titute felicity?</P>
<P>"Appearances are often deceitful," &s;aid Malvina, (forgetting in that moment the caution &s;he had hitherto inviolably ob&s;erved, of never hinting at the ill treament &s;he had received from the Counte&s;s of Dunreath and her daughter.) "Appearances are often deceitful," &s;he &s;aid, "as I, alas! too fatally experience. The glare, the o&s;tentation of wealth, a &s;oul of &s;en&s;ibility would wil|lingly re&s;ign for privacy and plainne&s;s, if they were to be attended with real friend&s;hip and &s;ympathy."</P>
<P>"And how few," cried Fitzalan, turning his expre&s;&s;ive eyes upon her face, "can know Lady Malvina without feeling friend&s;hip for her virtues, and &s;ympathy for her &s;orrows." As he &s;poke, he pre&s;&s;ed her hand again&s;t his heart, and &s;he felt the knot of bibbon, he had &s;natch|ed from her &s;i&s;ter: &s;he in&s;tantly withdrew her hand, and darting a haughty glance at him, "Captain Fitz|alan,"
<PB N="21" REF="038416_0020_1011E155D8B8E350">
&s;aid &s;he, "you were going, I believe, to Lady Augu&s;ta; let me not detain you."</P>
<P>Fitzalan's pa&s;&s;ions were no longer under the dominion of rea&s;on; he tore the ribbon from his brea&s;t, and flung it into the &s;ea&mdash;"Going to Lady Augu&s;ta?"&mdash;he ex|claimed&mdash;"and is her lovely &s;i&s;ter then really deceiv|ed? Ah! Lady Malvina, I now gaze on the dear at|traction that drew me to the Abbey. The feelings of a real, a hopele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion could ill &s;upport raillery or ob&s;ervation: I hid my pa&s;&s;ion within the rece&s;s of my heart, and gladly allowed my vi&s;its to be placed to the account of an object truly indifferent, that I might have opportunities of &s;eeing an object I adored." Malvina blu&s;hed and trembled. "Fitzalan," cried &s;he, after a pau&s;e, "I dete&s;t deceit."</P>
<P>"I abhor it too, Lady Malvina," &s;aid he; "but why &s;hould I now endeavour to prove my &s;incerity, when I know it &s;o very immaterial? Excu&s;e me for what I have already uttered, and believe that though &s;u&s;cepti|ble, I am not a&s;piring." He then pre&s;ented his hand to Malvina; &s;he de&s;cended from her &s;eat, and they walked towards the Abbey. Lady Malvina's pace was &s;low; and her blu&s;hes, had Fitzalan looked at her, would have ex|pre&s;&s;ed more plea&s;ure than re&s;entment: &s;he &s;eemed to expect a &s;till further declaration; but Fitzalan was too confu&s;ed to &s;peak; nor indeed was it his intention again to indulge him&s;elf on the dangerous &s;ubject. They pro|ceeded in &s;ilence; at the Abbey gate they &s;topt, and he wi&s;hed her good night. 'Shall we not &s;oon &s;ee you at the Abbey?" exclaimed Lady Malvina in a flurried voice, which &s;eemed to &s;ay &s;he thought his adieu rather an ha&s;ty one. "No my lovely friend," cried Fitzalan, pau&s;ing, while he looked on her with the mo&s;t compa&s;|&s;ioned tenderne&s;s&mdash;"in future I &s;hall chiefly confine my&s;elf to the fort." "Do you dread an inva&s;ion?" a&s;k|ed &s;he, &s;miling, while a &s;tolen glance of her eye gave a peculiar meaning to her words. "I long dreaded that," cried he, in the &s;ame &s;train, "and my fears were well founded; but I mu&s;t now mu&s;ter all my powers to di&s;|lodge
<PB N="22" REF="038416_0021_1011E158EC316290">
the enemy." He ki&s;&s;ed her hand, and precipi|tately retired.</P>
<P>Lady Malvina repaired to her chamber, in &s;uch a tu|mult of plea&s;ure as &s;he had never before experienced She admired Fitzalan from the fir&s;t evening &s;he beheld him; though his attentions were directed to her &s;i&s;ter, the language of his eyes to her contradicted any at|tachment, the&s;e attentions might have intimated; his gentlene&s;s and &s;en&s;ibility &s;eemed congenial to her own. Hitherto &s;he had been the &s;lave of tyranny and caprice; and now, for the fir&s;t time, experienced that &s;oothing tenderne&s;s, her wounded feelings had &s;o long &s;ighed for. She was agitated and delighted; &s;he overlooked every ob&s;tacle to her wi&s;hes, and waited impatiently a farther explanation of Fitzalan's &s;entiments.</P>
<P>Far different were his feelings from her's: to know he was beloved, could &s;carcely yield him plea&s;ure, when he reflected on his hopele&s;s &s;ituation, which forbad his availing him&s;elf of any advantage that knowledge might have afforded. Of an union indeed he did not dare to think, &s;ince its con&s;equences, he knew, mu&s;t be de&s;truction: for rigid and au&s;tere as the Earl was repre|&s;ented, he could not flatter him&s;elf he would ever par|don &s;uch a &s;tep; and the means of &s;upporting Lady Mal|vina, in any degree of comfort, he did not po&s;&s;e&s;s him|&s;elf. He determined as much as po&s;&s;ible, to avoid her pre&s;ence, and regretted continually having yielded to the impul&s;e of his heart, and revealed his love, &s;ince he believed it had augmented her's.</P>
<P>By degrees he di&s;continued his vi&s;its at the Abbey; but often met Lady Malvina at parties in the neighbour|hood; caution, however, always &s;ealed his lips, and eve|ry appearance of particularity was avoided. The time now approached for the departure of the regiment from Scotland; and Lady Malvina, in&s;tead of the explana|tion &s;he &s;o fondly expected, &s;o ardently de&s;ired, &s;aw Fitzalan &s;tudious to avoid her.</P>
<P>The di&s;appointment this conduct gave ri&s;e to, was too much for the tender and romantic heart of Malvina to bear without &s;ecretly repining. Society grew irk&s;ome; &s;he
<PB N="23" REF="038416_0022_1011E15B7B056BB8">
became more than ever attached to &s;olitary rambles, which gave her opportunities of indulging her &s;orrows without re&s;traint: &s;orrows, pride often reproached her for experiencing.</P>
<P>It was within a week of the change of garri&s;on, when Malvina repaired one evening to the rock, where Fitz|alan had di&s;clo&s;ed his tenderne&s;s; a &s;imilarity of feeling led him thither; he &s;aw his danger, but he had no pow|er to retreat; he &s;at down by Malvina, and they con|ver&s;ed for &s;ome time on indifferent &s;ubjects: at la&s;t, after the pau&s;e of a minute, Malvina exclaimed, "you go then, Fitzalan, never, never, I &s;uppo&s;e, to return here again." "'Tis probable I may not indeed," &s;aid he. "Then we &s;hall never meet again," cried &s;he, while a trickling tear &s;tole down her lovely cheek, which tinged, as it was with the flu&s;h of agitation, looked now like a half-blown ro&s;e moi&s;tened with the dews of early morning.</P>
<P>"Yes, my lovely friend," &s;aid he, "we &s;hall meet again&mdash;we &s;hall meet in a better place; in that heaven," continued be, &s;ighing, and laying his cold trembling hand upon her's, "which will recompence all our &s;uf|ferings." "You are melancholy to-night, Fitzalan," cried Lady Malvina in a voice &s;carcely articulate.</P>
<P>"Oh! can you wonder at it?" exclaimed he, over|come by her emotion, and forgetting in a moment all his re&s;olutions&mdash;"Oh! can you wonder at my melan|choly, when! know not but that this is the la&s;t time I &s;hall &s;ee the only woman I ever loved&mdash;when I know, that in bidding her adieu, I re&s;ign all the plea&s;ure, the happine&s;s of my life."</P>
<P>Malvina could no longer re&s;train her feelings; &s;he &s;unk upon his &s;houlder, and wept. "Good heavens," cri|ed Fitzalan, almo&s;t trembling beheath the lovely burthen he &s;upported&mdash;"What a cruel &s;ituation is mine! But, Malvina, I will not, cannot plunge you in de&s;truction. Led by nece&s;&s;ity, as well as choice to embrace the pro|fe&s;&s;ion of a &s;oldier, I have no income, but what is deri|ved from that profe&s;&s;ion: though my own di&s;tre&s;&s;es I could bear with fortitude, yours would totally unman me;
<PB N="24" REF="038416_0023_1011E15D0B91E618">
nor would my honour be le&s;s injured than my peace, were you involved in difficulties on my account. Our &s;eparation is therefore, alas, inevitable.</P>
<P>"Oh! no," exclaimed Malvina, "the difficulties you have mentioned, will vani&s;h. My father's affections were early alienated from me; and my fate is of little con&s;equence to him&mdash;nay, I have rea&s;on to believe he will be glad of an excu&s;e for leaving his large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to Augu&s;ta; and oh! how little &s;hall I envy her tho&s;e po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions, if the happy de&s;tiny I now look forward to is mine." As &s;he &s;poke her mild eyes re&s;ted on the face of Fitzalan, who cla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ped her to his bo&s;om in a &s;udden tran&s;port of tenderne&s;s. "But though my fa|ther is partial to Augu&s;ta," &s;he continued, "I am &s;ure he will not be unnatural to me; and though he may withhold affluence, he will, I am confident allow me a competence&mdash;nay, Lady Dunreath, I believe, in plea&s;ure at my removal from the Abbey, would, if he he&s;itated, in that re&s;pect become my interce&s;&s;or."</P>
<P>The energy with which Malvina &s;poke, convinced Fitzalan of the &s;trength of her affection. An extacy, never before felt, pervaded his &s;oul at the idea of being &s;o beloved: vainly did prudence whi&s;per, that Malvina might be deluding her&s;elf with fal&s;e hopes; the &s;ugge&s;|tions of love triumphed over every con&s;ideration and again folding the fair being he held in his arms, to his heart, he &s;oftly a&s;ked, would &s;he, at all events unite her de&s;tiny with his.</P>
<P>Lady Malvina, who firmly believed what &s;he had &s;aid to him would really happen, and who deemed a &s;epara|tion from him the greate&s;t misfortune which could po&s;|&s;ibly befall her, blu&s;hed, and faultering yielded a wil|ling con&s;ent.</P>
<P>The means of accompli&s;hing their wi&s;hes now occupied their thoughts: Fitzalan's imagination was too fertile, not &s;oon to &s;ugge&s;t a &s;cheme, which had a probability of &s;ucce&s;s; he re&s;olved to entru&s;t the chaplain of the regiment with the affair, and reque&s;t his attendance the en&s;uing night in the chapel of the Abbey, where Lady Malvina
<PB N="25" REF="038416_0024_1011E15E98375740">
promi&s;ed to meet them with her maid, on who&s;e &s;ecrecy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he thought &s;he could rely.</P>
<P>It was &s;ettled that Fitzalan &s;hould pay a vi&s;it the next morning to the Abbey, and give Malvina a cer|tain &s;ign, if he &s;ucceeded with the chaplain.</P>
<P>The increa&s;ing darkne&s;s at length reminded them of the latene&s;s of the hour: Fitzalan conducted Malvina to the Abbey gate, where they &s;eparated, each involved in a tumult of hopes, fears, and wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>The next morning Lady Malvina brought her work into her &s;i&s;ter's dre&s;&s;ing-room; at la&s;t Fitzalan entered; he was attacked by Augu&s;ta for his long ab&s;ence, which he excu&s;ed by pleading regimental bu&s;ine&s;s. After tri|fling &s;ome time with her, he prevailed on her to &s;it down to the harp&s;ichord; and then glancing at Malvina he gave her the promi&s;ed &s;ignal.</P>
<P>Her con&s;cious eyes were in&s;tantly bent to the ground; a crim&s;on glow was &s;uddenly &s;ucceeded by a deadly pale|ne&s;s; her head &s;unk upon her bo&s;om; and her agitation, mu&s;t have excited &s;u&s;picions, had it been perceived; but Fitzalan purpo&s;ely bent over her &s;i&s;ter, and thus gave her an opportunity of retiring unnoticed from the room. As &s;oon as &s;he had regained a little compo&s;ure, &s;he called her maid, and after receiving many promi&s;es of &s;ecrecy, unfolded to her the whole affair. It was long pa&s;t midnight hour ere Malvina would attempt repairing to the chapel; when &s;he at la&s;t ro&s;e for that purpo&s;e, &s;he trembled univer&s;ally; a kind of horror chilled her heart; &s;he began to fear &s;he was about doing wrong, and he&s;ita|ted; but when &s;he reflected on the noble genero&s;ity of Fitzalan, and that &s;he her&s;elf had precipitated him to the mea&s;ure they were about taking, her he&s;itation was over; and leaning on her maid, &s;he &s;tole through the winding galleries, and lightly de&s;cending the &s;tairs, entered the long hall, which terminated in a dark arch|ed pa&s;&s;age, that opened into the chapel.</P>
<P>This was a wild and gloomy &s;tructure, retaining every where ve&s;tiges of that monki&s;h &s;uper&s;tition which had erected it; beneath it were the vaults which contained
<PB N="26" REF="038416_0025_1011E162A9C2D778">
the ance&s;tors of the Earl of Dunreath, who&s;e deeds and titles were enumerated on gothic monuments; their du&s;t covered banners waving around in &s;ullen dignity to the rude gale, which found admittance through the broken windows.</P>
<P>The light, which the maid held, produced deep &s;ha|dows, that heightened the &s;olemnity of the place.</P>
<P>"They are not here." &s;aid Malvina, ca&s;ting her fearful eyes around. She went to the door, which open|ed into a thick wood; but here &s;he only heard the breeze ru&s;tling among&s;t the trees; &s;he turned from it, and &s;inking upon the &s;teps of the altar, gave way to an agony of tears and lamentations. A low murmur reach|ed her ear; &s;he &s;tarted up; the chapel door was gently pu&s;hed open, and Fitzalan entered with the chaplain: they had been watching in the wood for the appearance of light. Malvina was &s;upported to the altar, and a few minutes made her the wife of Fitzalan.</P>
<P>She had not courage, till within a day or two previ|ous to the regiment's departure from Scotland, to ac|quaint the Earl with her marriage: the Counte&s;s already knew it, through the means of Malvina's woman, who was a creature of her own. Lady Dunreath exulted at the pro&s;pect of Malvina's ruin; it at once gratified the malevolence of her &s;oul, and the avaricious de&s;ires &s;he had of increa&s;ing her own daughter's fortune: &s;he had, be&s;ides, another rea&s;on to rejoice at it: this was, the attachment lady Augu&s;ta had formed for Fitzalan, which, her mother feared, would have precipitated her into a &s;tep as imprudent as her &s;i&s;ter's, had &s;he not been before hand with her.</P>
<P>This fear the impetuous pa&s;&s;ions of Lady Augu&s;ta naturally excited. She really loved Fitzalan: a degree of frantic rage po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her at his marriage; &s;he cur&s;ed her &s;i&s;ter in the bitterne&s;s of her heart, and joined with lady Dunreath in working up the Earl's naturally au&s;tere and violent pa&s;&s;ion into &s;uch a paroxy&s;m of fury and re|&s;entment, that he at la&s;t &s;olemnly refu&s;ed forgivene&s;s to Malvina, and bid her never more appear in his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="038416_0026_1011E16438676078">
She now began to tread the thorny path of life; and though her guide was tender and affectionate, nothing could allay her angui&s;h for having involved him in dif|ficulties which his noble &s;pirit could ill brook, or &s;trug|gle again&s;t. The fir&s;t year of their union &s;he had a &s;on, who was called after her father, O&s;car Dunreath: the four years that &s;ucceeded his birth were pa&s;&s;ed in wretch|edne&s;s that baffles de&s;cription. At the expiration of this period their debts were &s;o increa&s;ed, Fitzalan was compelled to &s;ell out on half-pay. Lady Malvina now ex|pected an addition to her family; her &s;ituation, &s;he ho|ped, would move her father's heart, and re&s;olved to a&s;|&s;ay every thing, which afforded the &s;malle&s;t pro&s;pect of obtaining comfort for her hu&s;band and his babes: therefore &s;he prevailed on him to carry her to Scotland.</P>
<P>They lodged at a pea&s;ant's in the neighbourhood of the Abbey: he informed them, that the Earl's infirmi|ties were increa&s;ing; and that Lady Dunreath had ju&s;t celebrated her daughter's marriage with the Marquis of Ro&s;eline. This nobleman had pa&s;&s;ionately admired La|dy Malvina; an admiration the Counte&s;s always wi&s;h|ed to transfer to her daughter. On the marriage of Malvina he went abroad: his pa&s;&s;ion was conquered ere he returned to Scotland: and he di&s;dained not the over|tures made for his alliance from the Abbey. His favour|ite propen&s;ities, pride and avarice, were gratified by the Earl of Dunreath's &s;ole heire&s;s.</P>
<P>The day after her arrival, Lady Malvina &s;ent little O&s;car, with the old pea&s;ant, to the Abbey: O&s;car was a perfect cherubim.</P>
<LG>
<L>The bloom of op'ning flowers, un&s;ully'd beauty,</L>
<L>Softne&s;s and &s;weete&s;t innocence he wore,</L>
<L>And look'd like nature in the world's fir&s;t &s;pring.</L>
</LG>
<P>Lady Malvina gave him a letter for the Earl, in which, after pathetically de&s;cribing her &s;ituation, &s;he be&s;ought him, to let the uplifted hands of innocence plead her cau&s;e. The pea&s;ant watched, till the hour came for Lady Dunreath to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o out in her carriage, as was her daily cu&s;tom: he then de&s;ired to be conducted
<PB N="28" REF="038416_0027_1011E16686D98270">
to the Earl, and was accordingly u&s;hered into his pre|&s;ence; he found him alone, and briefly informed him of his errand. The Earl frowned and looked agitated, but did not by any means expre&s;s that di&s;plea&s;ure which the pea&s;ant had expected: feeling for him&s;elf, indeed, had lately &s;oftened his heart; he was unhappy; his wife and daughter had attained the completion of their wi&s;hes, and no longer paid him the attention his age required. He refu&s;ed however, to accept the letter: little O&s;car, who had been gazing on him from the moment he enter|ed the apartment, now ran forward gently &s;troking his hand; he &s;miled in his face and exclaimed "ah! pray do&mdash;take poor Mamma's letter." The Earl involuntarily took it; as he read, the mu&s;cles of his face began to work, and a tear dropt from him. "Poor mamma cries too," &s;aid O&s;car, upon who&s;e hand the tear fell. "Why did your mamma &s;end you to me?" &s;aid the Earl. "Becau&s;e &s;he &s;aid," cried O&s;car, "that you were my grandpapa&mdash;and &s;he bids me love you, and teaches me every day to pray for you." "Heaven ble&s;s you my lovely pratler," exclaimed the Earl, with &s;udden emotion, pattinp his head as he &s;poke. At this moment Lady Dunreath ru&s;hed into the apartment; one of her favourites had followed her, to relate the &s;cene that was going forward within it; and &s;he returned with all po&s;&s;ible expedition, to counteract any dangerous impre&s;|&s;ions that might be made upon the Earl's mind. Rage inflamed her countenance; the Earl knew the violence of her temper; he was unequal to contention, and ha&s;tily motioned for the pea&s;ant to retire with the child. The account of his reception excited the mo&s;t flattering hopes in the bo&s;om of his mother; &s;he counted the tedious hours, in expectation of a kind &s;ummons to the Ab|bey; but no &s;uch &s;ummons came. The next morning the child was &s;ent to it; but the porter refu&s;ed him ad|mittance, by the expre&s;s command of the Earl, he &s;aid. Frightened at his rudene&s;s, the child returned weeping to his mother, who&s;e bla&s;ted expectations wrung her heart with agony, and tears and la|mentations broke from her. The evening was far advanced, when &s;uddenly her features brightened:
<PB N="29" REF="038416_0028_1011E16865162400">
"I will go," cried &s;he, &s;tarting up&mdash;"I will again try to melt his obduracy. Oh! with what lowline&s;s &s;hould a child bend before an offended parent. Oh! with what fortitude, what patience, &s;hould a wife, a mother, try to overcome difficulties, which &s;he is con&s;cious of having precipitated the objects of her tendere&s;t effecti|ons into."</P>
<P>The night was dark and tempe&s;tuous: &s;he would not &s;uffer Fitzalan to attend her, but &s;he proceeded to the Abbey, leaning on the pea&s;ant's arm. She would not be repul&s;ed at the door, but forced her way into the hall: here Lady Dunreath met her, and, with mingled pride and cruelty, refu&s;ed her acce&s;s to her father, declar|ing it was by his de&s;ire &s;he did &s;o. "Let me &s;ee him but for a moment," &s;aid the lovely &s;upplient, cla&s;ping her white and emaciated hands together&mdash;"by all that is tender in humanity, I be&s;eech you to grant my reque&s;t."</P>
<P>"Turn this frantic woman from the Abbey," &s;aid the implacable Lady Dunreath trembling with pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;"at your peril &s;uffer her to continue here. The peace of your Lord is too precious to be di&s;turbed by her exclamations."</P>
<P>The imperious order was in&s;tantly obeyed, though, as Cordelia &s;ays, "it was a night when one would not have turned an enemy's dog from the door." The rain poured down in torrents; the &s;ea roared with aw|ful violence; and the wind raged through the wood as if it would tear up the trees by the roots. The pea&s;ant charitably flung his plaid over Malvina; &s;he moved me|chanically along; her &s;en&s;es appeared quite &s;tupified Fitzalan watched for her at the door; &s;he ru&s;hed into his extended arms, and fainted; and it was long ere &s;he &s;hewed any &s;ymptoms of returning life. Fitzalan wept over her in the angui&s;h and di&s;traction of his &s;oul; and &s;carcely could he forbear execrating the Being who had &s;o grievou&s;ly afflicted her gentle &s;pirit: by degrees &s;he revived; and, as &s;he pre&s;&s;ed him feebly to her brea&s;t, exclaimed, "the fatal &s;troke is given&mdash;I have been turned from my father's door."</P>
<P>The cottage in which they lodged afforded but few of
<PB N="30" REF="038416_0029_1011E169F8DA3EB8">
the nece&s;&s;aries, and none of the comforts of life; &s;uch, at lea&s;t, as they had been accu&s;tomed to. In Malvina's pre&s;ent &s;ituation, Fitzalan dreaded the lo&s;s of her life, &s;hould they continue in their pre&s;ent abode; but whither could he take her, wanderer as he was upon the face of the earth? At length the faithful Edwin occurred to his re|collection: his hou&s;e, he was confident, would afford them a comfortable a&s;&s;ylum, where lady Malvina would experi|ence all that tenderne&s;s and care her &s;ituation demanded.</P>
<P>He immediately &s;et about procuring a conveyance, and the following morning Malvina bid a la&s;t adieu to Scotland.</P>
<P>Lady Dunreath, in the mean time, &s;uffered torture: after &s;he had &s;een Malvina turned from the Abbey, &s;he returned to her apartment; it was furni&s;hed with the mo&s;t luxurious elegance, yet could &s;he not re&s;t within it. Con&s;cience already told her, if Malvina died, &s;he mu&s;t con&s;ider her&s;elf her murderer; her pale and woe-worn image &s;eemed &s;till before her; a cold terror oppre&s;&s;ed her heart, which the horrors of the night augmented; the tempe&s;t &s;hook the battlements of the Abbey; and the wind, which howled through the gal|leries, &s;eemed like the la&s;t moans of &s;ome wandering &s;pirit of the pile, bewailing the fate of one of its faire&s;t daughters. To cruelty and ingratitude Lady Dunreath had added deceit: her Lord was yielding to the &s;olicita|tions of his child, when &s;he counteracted his intentions b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a tale of fal&s;ehood. The vi&s;ions of the night were al&s;o dreadful: Malvina appeared expiring before her; and the late Lady Dunreath, by her bed-&s;ide, reproach|ing her barbarity. "Oh cruel!" the gha&s;tly figure &s;eemed to &s;ay, "is it you, whom I fo&s;tered in my bo|&s;om, that have done this deed&mdash;driven forth my child, a forlorn and wretched wanderer.</P>
<P>Oh con&s;cience, how awful are thy terrors! thou art the vicegerent of heaven, and anticipate its vengeance, ere the final hour of retribution arrives. Guilt may be triumphant, but never, never can be happy: it finds no &s;hield again&s;t thy &s;tings and arrows. The heart thou &s;mite&s;t, bleeds in every pore, and &s;ighs amid&s;t gaiety and &s;plendor.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="038416_0030_1011E16DE9380850">
The unfortunate travellers were welcomed with the true&s;t ho&s;pitality by the grateful Edwin: he had mar|ried, &s;oon after his return from America, a young girl, to whom from his earlie&s;t youth, he was attached. His parents died &s;oon after his union, the whole of their lit|tle patrimony devolved to him. Soothed and attended with the utmo&s;t tenderne&s;s and re&s;pect, Fitzalan hoped lady Malvina would here regain her health and peace: he intended, after her recovery to endeavour to be put on full pay; and tru&s;ted he &s;hould prevail on herto con|tinue at the farm.</P>
<P>At length the hour came, in which &s;he gave a daugh|ter to his arms. From the beginning of her illne&s;s the people about her were alarmed; too &s;oon was it proved, their alarms were well founded: &s;he lived after the birth of her infant but a few minutes, and died embracing her hu&s;band, and ble&s;&s;ing his children.</P>
<P>Fitzalan's feelings cannot well be de&s;cribed: they were at fir&s;t too much for rea&s;on, and he continued &s;ome time in perfect &s;tupefaction. When he regained his &s;en&s;ibility, his grief was not outrageous; it was that deep, &s;till &s;orrow, which fa&s;tens on the heart, and cannot vent it&s;elf in tears or lamentations: he &s;at with calmne&s;s by the bed, where the remains of Mal|vina lay; he gazed, without &s;hrinking, on her pale face which death, as if in pity to his feelings, had not disfi|gured; he ki&s;&s;ed her cold lips, continually exclaiming, "Oh! had we never met, &s;he might &s;till have been liv|ing." His language was &s;omething like that of a poet of her own country.</P>
<LG>
<L>Woe mode&s;t crim&s;on tiped flower,</L>

<P>It was when he &s;aw them about removing her that all the tempe&s;t of his grief broke forth. Oh! how im|po&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the angui&s;h of the poor widower's heart when he returned from &s;eeing his Malvina laid in her la&s;t recepticle; he &s;hut him&s;elf up in the room where &s;he had expired, and ordered no one to approach him; he thew him&s;elf upon the bed; he laid his cheek upon her pillow, he gra&s;ped it to his bo&s;om, he wetted

it with tears, becau&s;e &s;he had breathed upon it; oh how &s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, how dreary, how de&s;olate, did all appear around him; "and &s;hall this de&s;olation never more be enlight|ened," he exclaimed "by the &s;oft mu&s;ic of Malvina's voice? &s;hall there eyes never more be cheered by behold|ing her angelic face;" exhau&s;ted by his feelings, he &s;unk into a &s;lumber; he dreamt of Malvina, and thought &s;he my be&s;ide him: he awoke with &s;udden extacy, and, under the &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion of the dream he &s;tretched out his arms to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;old her. Alas! all was empty void: he &s;tarted up, he groaned in the bitterne&s;s of his &s;oul; he traver&s;ed the room with a di&s;tracted pace; he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">at him down in the little window from whence he could view the &s;pire of the church, (now gli&s;tening in the moon|beams) by which &s;he was interred. "Deep, &s;till, and profound." cried he "is the &s;leep of my Malvina&mdash;the voice of love cannot awake her from it; nor does &s;he now dream of her midnight mourner."</P>
<P>The cold breeze of night brew upon his forehead; but he heeded it not; his whole &s;oul was full of Malvina, whom torturing fancy repre&s;ented to his view, in the ha|biliments of the grave. "And is this emaciated form, this pale face," he exclaimed as if he had really &s;een her, "all that remains of elegance and beauty, once unequal|led."</P>
<P>A native &s;en&s;e of religion only checked the tran&s;ports of his grief: that &s;weet, that &s;acred power, which pours balm upon the wounds of &s;orrow, and &s;aves its children from de&s;pair; that Power whi&s;pered to his heart, a patient &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of heaven was the &s;ure&s;t means he could attain, of again rejoining his Malvina.</P>
<P>She was interred in the village church-yard: at the head of her grave a &s;tone was placed, on which was rudely cut,
<Q>MALVINA FITZALAN, ALIKE LOVELY AND UNFORTUNATE.</Q></P>
<P>Fitzalan would not permit her empty title to be put on it; "&s;he is buried," he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aid, "as the wife of a
<PB N="33" REF="038416_0032_1011E172C575F6E8">
wretched &s;oldier, not as the daughter of a wealthy peer."</P>
<P>She had reque&s;ted her infant might be called after her own mother; her reque&s;t was &s;acred to Fitzalan and it was baptized by the united names of Amanda Mal|vina. Mrs. Edwin was then nur&s;ing her fir&s;t girl; but &s;he &s;ent it out, and took the infant of Fitzalan in its place to her bo&s;om.</P>
<P>The money, which Fitzalan had procured by di&s;po&s;ing of his commi&s;&s;ion, was now nearly exhau&s;ted; but his mind was too enervated to allow him to think of any project for future &s;upport. Lady Malvina was decea&s;ed two months, when a nobleman came into the neigh|bourhood, with whom Fitzalan had once been intimately acquainted: the acquaintance was now renewed; and Fitzalan's appearance, with the little hi&s;tory of his mi&s;|fortunes &s;o much affected and intere&s;ted his friend, that without &s;olicitation he procured him a company in a regiment, then &s;tationed in England. Thus did Fitz|alan again enter into active life; but his &s;pirits were bro|ken, and his con&s;titution injured. Four years he conti|nued in the army; when pining to have his children, (all that now remained of a woman he adored) under his own care, he obtained, through the intere&s;t of a friend, leave to &s;ell out: O&s;car was then eight, and Amanda four; the delighted father, as he held them to his heart wept over them tears of mingled pain and plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>He had &s;een in Devon&s;hire, where he was quartered for &s;ome time, a little romantic &s;olitude, quite adapted to his ta&s;te and finances: he propo&s;ed for it, and &s;oon became its proprietor. Hither he carried his children, much again&s;t the inclination of the Edwins, who loved them as their own: two excellent &s;chools in the neigh|bourhood gave them the u&s;ual advantages of genteel edu|cation; but as they were only day &s;cholars the improve|ment or rather forming of their morals, was the plea|&s;ing ta&s;k of their father. To his a&s;&s;iduous care too they were indebted for the rapid progre&s;s they made in their &s;tudies; and for the graceful &s;implicity of their manners; they rewarded his care, and grew up as amia|ble and lovely as his fonde&s;t wi&s;hes could de&s;ire. As O&s;|car
<PB N="34" REF="038416_0033_1011E175253BC8B8">
advanced in life, his father began to experience new cares; for he had not the power of putting him in the way of making any provi&s;ion for him&s;elf. A military life was what O&s;car appeared anxious for: he had early conceived a predilecton for it, from hearing his father &s;peak of the&s;e rvices he had &s;een; but though he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed quite the &s;pirit of a hero, he had the true&s;t tenderne&s;s, the mo&s;t engaging &s;oftne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition; his temper was indeed at once mild, artle&s;s and affectionate. He was about eighteen, when the proprietor of the e&s;tate, on which his father held his farm, died, and his heir, a colonel in the army, immediately came down from London to take formal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: he &s;oon became ac|quainted with Fitzalan, who, in the cour&s;e of conver&s;a|tion one day, expre&s;&s;ed the anxiety he &s;uffered on his &s;on's account. The colonel &s;aid he was a fine youth, and it was a pity he was not provided for: he left Devon|&s;hire, however, &s;hortly after this, without appearing in the lea&s;t intere&s;ted about him.</P>
<P>Fitzalan's heart was oppre&s;&s;ed with anxiety; he could not purcha&s;e for his &s;on, without depriving him&s;elf of &s;upport. With the nobleman who had formerly &s;erved him &s;o e&s;&s;entially, he had kept up no intercour&s;e, &s;ince he quitted the army; but he frequently heard of him, and was told he had become quite a man of the world, which was an implication of his having lo&s;t all feeling: an ap|plication to him, therefore, he feared would be unavail|ing, and he felt too proud to &s;ubject him&s;elf to a repul&s;e.</P>
<P>From this di&s;quietude he was unexpectedly relieved by a letter from the Earl of Cherbury, his yet kind friend, informing him, he had procured an en&s;igncy for O&s;car, in colonel Belgrave's regiment, which he con&s;idered a very fortunate circum&s;tance, as the colonel, he was confident, from per&s;onally knowing the young gentle|man, would render him every &s;ervice in his power. The Earl chid Fitzalan for never having kept up a corre&s;pondence with him; a&s;&s;ured him, he had never forgotten the friend&s;hip of their earlier years; and that he had gladly &s;eized the fir&s;t opportunity which offered,
<PB N="35" REF="038416_0034_1011E17854129C60">
of &s;erving him in the per&s;on of his &s;on; which opportu|nity he was indebted to colonel Belgrave for.</P>
<P>Fitzalan's &s;oul was filled with gratitude and rapture; he immediately wrote to the Earl and the colonel, in terms expre&s;&s;ive of his feelings Colonel Belgrave re|ceived his thanks, as if he had really de&s;erved them; but this was not by any means the ca&s;e; he was a man devoid of &s;en&s;ibility, and had never once thought of &s;erving Fitzalan and his &s;on; his mentioning them was merely accidental.</P>
<P>In a large company, of which the earl of Cherbury was one, the di&s;cour&s;e happened to turn on the Dunreath family, and by degrees led to Fitzalan, who was &s;ever|ally blamed and pitied for his connexion with it; the &s;ubject was, in the opinion of Col. Belgrave, &s;o apropos, he could not forbear de&s;cribing his pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and inquietude about his &s;on, who, he &s;aid he fancied, m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t, like a &s;econd Cincin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">atus, take the plough-&s;hare in&s;tead of the &s;word.</P>
<P>Lord Cherbury lo&s;t no part of this di&s;cour&s;e; though immer&s;ed in politics and other intricate concerns, he yet retained, and was ready to obey, the dictates of humani|ty, particularly when they did not interfere with his own intere&s;ts; he therefore directly conceived the de|&s;ign of &s;erving his old friend.</P>
<P>O&s;car &s;oon quitted Devon&s;hire after his appointment, and brought a letter from his father to the colonel, in which he was &s;trongly recommended to his protection, as one un&s;killed in the ways of men.</P>
<P>And now all Fitzalan's care devolved upon Amanda; and mo&s;t amply did &s;he recompen&s;e it. To the im|provement of her genius, the cultivation of her talents, the promotion of her father's happine&s;s, &s;eemed her fir&s;t incentive; without him no amu&s;ement was enjoyed, without him no &s;tudy entered upon; he was her friend, guardian, and protector; and no language can expre&s;s, no heart (except a paternal one) conceive the rapture he felt, at &s;eeing a creature grow under
<Q><L>&mdash;his forming hand</L>
<L>&mdash;So fair,</L></Q>
<PB N="36" REF="038416_0035_1011E179DFF80D30">
That what &s;eemed fair in all the world, &s;eem'd now Mean, or in her contained.</P>
<P>Some years had elap&s;ed &s;ince O&s;car's departure, ere Col. Belgrave returned into their neighbourhood; he came &s;oon after his nuptials had been celebrated in Ire|land, with a lady of that country, whom O&s;car's letters de&s;cribed as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing every per&s;onal and mental charm, which could plea&s;e or captivate the heart. Col. Belgrave came unaccompanied by his fair bride. Fitzalan, who believed him his benefactor, and con&s;equently regarded him as a friend, (&s;till thinking it was through his means Lord Cherbury had &s;erved him) immediately waited upon him, and invited him to his hou&s;e. The invita|tion, after &s;ome time was accepted; but had he ima|gined what an attraction the hou&s;e contained, he would not have long he&s;itated about entering it: he was a man, indeed, of the mo&s;t depraved principles, and an object he admired, no tie, or &s;ituation, however &s;acred, could guard from his pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>Amanda was too much a child, when he was la&s;t in the country, to attract his ob&s;ervation; he had therefore no idea that the blo&s;&s;om he then &s;o carele&s;sly overlooked, had &s;ince expanded into &s;uch beauty.</P>
<P>How great was then his rapture and &s;urpri&s;e, when Fitzalan led into the room where he had received him, a tall, elegantly formed girl, who&s;e ro&s;y cheeks were dimpled with the &s;ofte&s;t &s;mile of complacence, and who&s;e fine blue eyes beamed with mode&s;ty and gratitude upon him: he in&s;tantly marked her for his prey, and ble&s;&s;ed his lucky &s;tars, which had in&s;pired Fitzalan with the idea of his being his benefactor; &s;ince that would give him a freer acce&s;s to the hou&s;e than he could other|wi&s;e have hoped for.</P>
<P>From this time he became almo&s;t an intimate at it, except when he cho&s;e to contrive little parties at his own, for Amanda: he took every opportunity that offered, without ob&s;ervation, to try to ingratiate him&s;elf into her favour; tho&s;e opportunities the un&s;u&s;pecting temper of Fitzalan allowed to be frequent; he would as &s;oon
<PB N="37" REF="038416_0036_1011E17B98A7C868">
have tru&s;ted Amanda to the care of Belgrave, as to that of her brother, and never therefore, prevented her walk|ing out with him, when he de&s;ired it, or receiving him in the morning, while he (him&s;elf) was ab&s;ent about the affairs of his farm; delighted to think the conver|&s;ation or talents of his daughter (for Amanda frequently &s;ung and played for the Colonel) could contribute to the amu&s;ement of his friend. Amanda innocently increa&s;|ed his flame, by the attention &s;he paid, which &s;he con|&s;idered but a ju&s;t tribute of gratitude for his &s;ervices: &s;he delighted in talking to him of her dear O&s;car; and often mentioned his lady, but was &s;urpri&s;ed to find he always waved the latter &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Belgrave could not long re&s;train the impetuo&s;ity of his pa&s;&s;ions; the &s;ituation of Fitzalan, (which he knew to be a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed one) would, he fancied, forward his de&s;igns on his daughter; and what tho&s;e de&s;igns were, he, by degrees, in a retired walk one day, unfolded to Amanda.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t &s;he did not perfectly under&s;tand him; but when, with increa&s;e audacity, he explained him&s;elf more fully, horror, indignation, and &s;urpri&s;e took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of her brea&s;t, and yielding to their feelings, &s;he turned, and fled to the hou&s;e, as if from a mon&s;ter. Belgrave was provoked and mortified: the &s;oftne&s;s of her manners had tempted him to believe, he was not indifferent to her, and that &s;he would prove an ea&s;y conque&s;t.</P>
<P>Poor Amanda would not appear in the pre&s;ence of her father, till &s;he had in &s;ome degree regained com|po&s;ure, as &s;he feared the &s;malle&s;t intimation of the af|fair might occa&s;ion fatal con&s;equences; as &s;he &s;at with him, a letter was brought her; &s;he could not think B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lgrave would have the effrontery to write, and opened it, &s;uppo&s;ing it came from &s;ome acquaintance in the neighbourhood. How great was the &s;hock &s;he &s;u&s;tained, on finding it from him; having thrown off the ma&s;k, he determined no longer to a&s;&s;ume any di&s;gui&s;e. Her pale|ne&s;s and confu&s;ion alarmed her father, and he in&s;tantly
<PB N="38" REF="038416_0037_1011E17EC0510248">
demanded the cau&s;e of her agitation: &s;he found longer concealment was impo&s;&s;ible, and throwing her&s;elf at her father's feet, be&s;ought him, as &s;he put the letter into his hands to re&s;train his pa&s;&s;ion. When he peru&s;ed it, he rai&s;ed her up, and commanded her, as &s;he valued his love or happine&s;s, to inform him of every particular, relative to the in&s;ult &s;he had received; &s;he obeyed, though terrified to behold her father trembling with emotion. When &s;he concluded, he tenderly embraced her, and bidding her confine her&s;elf to the hou&s;e, ro&s;e, and took down his hat; it was ea&s;y to gue&s;s whither he was going; her terror increa&s;ed; and in a voice &s;carce|ly articulate, &s;he be&s;ought him not to ri&s;k his &s;afety. He commanded her &s;ilence with a &s;ternne&s;s never before a&s;&s;umed: his manner awed her, but when &s;he &s;aw him leaving the room, her feelings could no longer be con|trolled; &s;he ru&s;hed after him, and flinging her arms round his neck, fainted on it. In this &s;ituation the unhap|py father was compelled to leave her to the care of a maid, le&s;t her pathetic remon&s;trances &s;hould delay the vengeance he re&s;olved to take on a wretch, who had me|ditated a deed of &s;uch atrocity again&s;t his peace; but Belgrave was not to be found. Scarcely, however, had Fitzalan returned to his half-di&s;tracted daughter, ere a letter was brought him from the wretch, in which he made the mo&s;t degrading propo&s;als, and bid Fitzalan beware how he an&s;wered them, as his &s;ituation had put him entirely into his power.</P>
<P>This was a fatal truth; Fitzalan had been tempted to make a large addition to his farm, from an idea of turn|ing the little money he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, to advantage, but was more ignorant of agriculture than he imagined; and this ignorance, joined to his own integrity of heart, rendered him the dupe of &s;ome de&s;igning wretches in his neighbourhood: his whole &s;tock dwindled away in unprofitable experiments, and he was now con&s;iderably in arrears with Belgrave.</P>
<P>The unge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">erous advantage he &s;trove to take of his &s;ituation, increa&s;ed, if po&s;&s;ible, his indignation; and again he &s;ought him but &s;till without &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="038416_0038_1011E181E0146AE8">
Belgrave &s;oon found no temptation of pro&s;perity would prevail on the father or daughter to accede to his wi&s;hes; he therefore re&s;olved to try whether the pre&s;&s;ure of adver&s;ity would render them more complying, and left the country, having fir&s;t ordered his &s;teward to pro|ceed directly again&s;t Fitzalan.</P>
<P>The con&s;equence of his order was an immediate exe|cution on his effects; and, but for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a good-natured farmer, he would have been arre&s;ted. By his means, and under favour of night, he and Amanda &s;et out for London; they arrived there in &s;afety, and re|tired to ob&s;cure lodgings. In this hour of di&s;tre&s;s, Fitzalan conquered all fal&s;e pride, and wrote to Lord Cherbury, entreating him to procure &s;ome employment, which would relieve his pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ituation; he cautiou&s;ly concealed every thing relative to Belgrave; he could not bear that it &s;hould be known he had ever been degraded by his infamous propo&s;als.</P>
<P>O&s;car's &s;afety, too, he knew, depended on his &s;e|crecy; as he was well convinced, no idea of danger, or elevation of rank, would &s;ecure the wretch from his fury, who had meditated &s;o great an injury again&s;t his &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>He had the mortification of having the letter he &s;ent to Lord Cherbury returned, as his Lord&s;hip was then ab&s;ent from town; nor was he expected for &s;ome months, having gone on an excur&s;ion of plea&s;ure to France. Some of the&s;e months had lingered away in all the horrors of anxiety and di&s;tre&s;s, when Fitzalan form|ed the re&s;olution of &s;ending Amanda into Wales, who&s;e health had con&s;iderably &s;uffered from the complicated unea&s;ine&s;s and terror &s;he experienced on her own and her father's account.</P>
<P>Belgrave had traced the fugatives; and though Fitz|alan was guarded again&s;t all the &s;tratagems he u&s;ed to have him arre&s;ted, he found means to have letters con|veyed to Amanda, full of ba&s;e &s;olicitations, and in&s;olent declarations; that the rigor he treated her father with, was quite again&s;t his feelings, and &s;hould in&s;tantly be
<PB N="40" REF="038416_0039_1011E18370AF0340">
withdrawn, if he acceded to the prepo&s;als he made for her.</P>
<P>But though Fitzalan had determined to &s;end Amanda into Wales with whom could he tru&s;t his heart's be&s;t trea&s;ure? At la&s;t the &s;on of the worthy farmer, who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in his journey to London, occurred to his remembrance: he came often to town, and always called upon Fitzalan. The young man, the moment it was propo&s;ed, expre&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t readine&s;s to attend Mi&s;s Fitzalan. As every precaution was nece&s;&s;ary, her father made her take the name of Dunford, and travel in the mail coach for the greater &s;ecurity. He divided the contents of his pur&s;e with her; and recommending this lovely and mo&s;t beloved child to the protection of heaven, &s;aw her part with mingled pain and plea&s;ure, promi&s;ing to give her the earlie&s;t intelligence of Lord Cherbury's arrival in town, which he &s;uppo&s;ed would fix his future de&s;tiny. Previous to his departure he wrote to the Edwins, informing them of her intended vi&s;it, and al&s;o her change of name for the pre&s;ent. This latter circum&s;tance, which was not &s;atisfactorily account|ed for, excited their warme&s;t curio&s;ity; and not think|ing it proper to a&s;k Amanda to gratify it, they, to u&s;e their own words, &s;ifted her companion, who he&s;itated not to inform of the indignities &s;he had &s;uffered from Colonel Belgrave, which were well known about his neighbourhood.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>A GENTLE noi&s;e in her chamber rou&s;ed Amanda from a light refre&s;hing &s;lumber, and &s;he be|held her nur&s;e &s;tanding by her bed-&s;ide, with a bowl of goat's whey; Amanda took the &s;alubrious draught with a &s;mile, and in&s;tantly &s;tarting up, was dre&s;&s;ed in a few minutes. She felt more compo&s;ed than &s;he had done for &s;ome time pa&s;t; the tran&s;ition from a narrow dark &s;treet to a fine open country, would have excited a lively tran&s;port in her mind, but for the idea of her father &s;till remaining in the gloomy &s;ituation &s;he had quitted.</P>
<P>On going out &s;he found the family all bu&s;ily employ|ed; Edwin and his &s;ons were mowing in a meadow near the hou&s;e, the nur&s;e was churning; Ellen wa&s;hing milk pails by the &s;tream in the valley; and Bet&s;ey turn|ing a cake for her breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>The tea-table was laid by a window, through which a woodbine crept, diffu&s;ing a delightful fragrance: the bees fea&s;ted on its &s;weetne&s;s, and the gaudy butterflies fluttered around it; the refulgent &s;un gladdened the face of nature; the morning breeze tempered its heat, and bore upon its dewy wings the &s;weets of opening flowers; birds carolled their matins almo&s;t on every &s;pray; and &s;cattered pea&s;ants, bu&s;ied in their various labours, enlivened the exten&s;ive pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>Amanda was delighted with all &s;he &s;aw, and wrote to her father, that his pre&s;ence was only wanting to complete her plea&s;ure. The young man who had attend|ed her, on receiving her letter, &s;et out for the village
<PB N="42" REF="038416_0041_1011E189706BE790">
from whence he was to return in a &s;tage coach to London.</P>
<P>The morning was pa&s;&s;ed by Amanda in arranging her little affairs, walking about the cottage, and convers|ing with the nur&s;e relative to pa&s;t times and pre&s;ent avo|cations. When the hour for dinner came, by her de&s;ire it was carried out into the rece&s;s in the garden, where the balmy air, the lovely &s;cene which &s;urrounded her, rendered it doubly delicious.</P>
<P>In the evening &s;he a&s;ked Ellen to take a walk with her, to which &s;he joyfully con&s;ented. "And pray, Mi&s;s," &s;aid Ellen, after &s;he had &s;martened her&s;elf with a clean white apron, her Sunday cap, and a hat loaded with pop|py-coloured ribbons, &s;miling as &s;he &s;poke at the pretty image her gla&s;s reflected, "where &s;hall we go?"</P>
<P>"To the church-yard," replied Amanda. "Oh Lord, Mi&s;s," cried Ellen, "won't that be rather a di&s;mal place to go to?" Indulge me, my dear Ellen," &s;aid Amanda, "in &s;hewing me the way thither: there is one &s;pot in it, my heart wants to vi&s;it." Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> church|yard lay at the entrace of the little village; the church was a &s;mall &s;tructure, who&s;e gothic appearance proclaim|ed its ancient date; it was rendered more venerable by the lofty elms and yews which &s;urrounded it, apparently coeval with it&s;elf, and which ca&s;t dark &s;hades upon the &s;pots, where the rude "forefather of the hamlet &s;lept," which
<Q><L>With uncouth rhymes, and &s;hapele&s;s &s;culpture deck'd,</L>
<L>Implor'd the pa&s;&s;ing tribute of a &s;igh.</L></Q></P>
<P>And it was a tribute Amanda paid, as &s;he proceeded to the grave of Lady Malvina, which Ellen pointed out: it was over-grown with gra&s;s and the flag, which bore her name, green, from time and damp. Amanda in|voluntarily &s;unk on her knees, and ki&s;&s;ed the hallowed earth: her eyes caught the melancholy in&s;cription, "Sweet &s;pirit," &s;he &s;aid, "Heaven now rewards your &s;ufferings. Oh, my mother! if departed &s;pirits are ever allowed to review this world, with love ineffable you may now be regarding your child. Oh! if &s;he is doomed to tread as thorny a path as the one you trod,
<PB N="43" REF="038416_0042_1011E18BDA325068">
may the &s;ame &s;weetne&s;s and patience that di&s;tingui&s;h|ed you, &s;upport her through it: with the &s;ame pious awe, the &s;ame meek &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, may &s;he bow to the de|&s;ignation of her Creator.</P>
<P>The affecting cata&s;trophe drew tears from the tender|hearted Ellen, who be&s;ought her not to continue longer in &s;uch a di&s;mal place. Amanda now ro&s;e weeping; her &s;pirits were entirely overcome; the bu&s;y objects of the day had amu&s;ed her mind and prevented it from meditating on its &s;orrows; but in the calm &s;olitude of the evening they gradually revived in her remembrance. Her father's ill health, &s;he feared, would increa&s;e for want of her tender attentions; and when &s;he thought of his di&s;tre&s;s, his confinement, his dejection, &s;he felt an agony at their &s;eparation.</P>
<P>Her melancholy was noticed at the cottage. Ellen informed the nur&s;e of the di&s;mal walk they had taken, which at once accounted for it; and the good woman exerted her&s;elf to enliven her dear child; but Amanda, though &s;he faintly &s;miled, was not to be cheered, and &s;oon retired to bed&mdash;pale, languid, and unhappy.</P>
<P>Returning light, in &s;ome degree, di&s;pelled her melan|choly; &s;he felt, however, for the fir&s;t time, that her hours would hang heavy on her hands, deprived as &s;he was of tho&s;e delightful re&s;ources, which had hitherto diver&s;ified them. To pa&s;s her time in li&s;tle&s;s inaction, or idle &s;aunters about the hou&s;e, was in&s;upportable; and be&s;ides &s;he found her pre&s;ence in the morning was a re|&s;traint on her humble friends, who did not deem it good manners to work before her; and to them, who like bees, were obliged to lay up their wintry hoard in &s;um|mer, the lo&s;s of time was irreparable.</P>
<P>In the di&s;traction of her father's affairs &s;he had lo&s;t her books, implements for drawing and mu&s;ical in&s;truments; and in the cottage &s;he could only find a bible, family prayer book, and a torn volume of old ballads.</P>
<P>"Tear heart, now I think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">." &s;aid the nur&s;e, you may go to the library at Tudor-Hall. where there are books enough to keep you a-going, if you lived to the

age of Mathu&s;alem him&s;elf, and very pretty reading to be &s;ure among&s;t them, or our Par&s;on Howel would not have been going there as often as he did, to &s;tudy, till he got a library of his own. The family are all away; and as the door is opened every fine day to air the room, you will not be noticed by nopoty going into it; though for that matter poor old Mrs Abergwilly would make you welcome enough, if you promi&s;ed to take none of the books away with you. But as I know you to be a little ba&s;hful or &s;o, I will if you choo&s;e, &s;tep over, and a&s;k her leave for you to go."&mdash;"If you plea&s;e," &s;aid Amanda; "I &s;hould not like to go without it."&mdash;"Well, I &s;han't be long," continued the nur&s;e, "and Ellen &s;hall &s;how you the way to-day; it will be a pretty pit of a walk for you to take every morning." The nur&s;e was as good as her word; &s;he returned &s;oon, with Mrs. Abergwilly's permi&s;&s;ion for Amanda to read in the library whenever &s;he plea&s;ed. In con&s;equence of this &s;he immediately proceeded to the Hall, who&s;e white turrets were &s;een from the cottage: it was a large and antique building, embo&s;omed in a grove; the library was on the ground floor, and entered by a &s;pacious folding door. As &s;oon as &s;he had reached it, Ellen left her, and returned to the cottage; and Amanda began with plea&s;ure to examine the apartment, who&s;e elegance and &s;implicity &s;truck her with immediate admiration.</P>
<P>On one &s;ide was a row of large <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, arched quite in the Gothic &s;tyle; oppo&s;ite to them were corre&s;ponding arches, in who&s;e rece&s;&s;es the book-ca&s;es were placed; round the&s;e arches were fe&s;toons of laurel, elegantly ex|ecuted in &s;tucco work and above them medalions of &s;ome of the mo&s;t celebrated poets; the chimney-piece, of the fine&s;t Italian marble, was beautifully inlaid and ornamented; the paintings on the ceiling were highly fini&s;hed, and of the allegorical kind; and it was diffi|cult to determine, whether the ta&s;te that de&s;igned, or the hand that executed them, merited mo&s;t prai&s;e; up|on marble pede&s;tals &s;tood a cele&s;tial and terre&s;trial globe, and one rece&s;s was entirely hung with maps. It was a room, from its &s;ituation and appearance, pe|culiarly
<PB N="45" REF="038416_0044_1011E18F4830A630">
adapted for &s;tudy and contemplation, all around was &s;olitude and &s;ilence, &s;ave the &s;oft ru&s;tling of the trees, who&s;e dark foliage ca&s;t a &s;olemn &s;hade upon the windows. Oppo&s;ite the entrance was another folding door, which being a little opened, Amanda could not re&s;i&s;t the de&s;ire &s;he felt, of &s;eeing what was beyond it; &s;he entered a large vaulted apartment, who&s;e airy light|ne&s;s formed a plea&s;ing contra&s;t to the gloomy one &s;he had left: the manner in which it was fitted up, and the mu&s;ical in&s;truments, declared this to be a mu&s;ic-room. It was hung with pale green dama&s;k, &s;potted with &s;il|ver, and bordered with fe&s;toons of ro&s;es, intermingled with light &s;ilver &s;prays; the &s;eats corre&s;ponded to the hangings; the tables were of fine inlaid wood; and &s;u|perb lu&s;tres were &s;u&s;pended from the ceiling, which re|pre&s;ented, in a ma&s;terly &s;tyle, &s;cenes from &s;ome of the pa&s;toral poets; the orche&s;tra, about the centre of the room, was inclo&s;ed with a light ballu&s;trading of white marble elevated by a few &s;teps.</P>
<P>The windows of this room commanding a plea&s;ant pro&s;pect of a deep romantic dale; the hills, through which it wound, di&s;playing a beautiful diver&s;ity of woody &s;cenery, inter&s;per&s;ed with green pa&s;tures and barren points of rocks: a fine fall of water fell from one of the highe&s;t of the hills, which, broken by intervening roots and branches of trees, run a hundred different ways, &s;park|ling in the &s;un beams as they emerged from the &s;hade.</P>
<P>Amanda &s;tood long at a window, enjoying this de|lightful pro&s;pect, and admiring the ta&s;te which had cho|&s;en this room for amu&s;ement; thus at once gratifying the eye and ear. On looking over the in&s;truments, &s;he &s;aw a piano forte unlocked; &s;he gently rai&s;ed the lid, and touching the keys, found them in tolerable order. Amanda adored mu&s;ic; her genius for it was great, had received every advantage her father could po&s;&s;ibly give it: in cultivating it he had laid up a fund of de|light for him&s;elf, for "his &s;oul was a &s;tream, that flow|ed at plea&s;ant &s;ounds."</P>
<P>Amanda could not re&s;i&s;t the pre&s;ent opportunity of gratifying her favourite inclination. "Harmony and I,"

cried &s;he, "have long been &s;trangers to each other." She &s;at down, and played a little tender air: tho&s;e her father loved recurred to recollection, and &s;he played a few of them with even more than u&s;ual elegance. "Ah dear and valued object," &s;he mournfully &s;ighed, "why are you not here to &s;hare my plea&s;ure?" &s;he wiped away a &s;tarting tear of tender remembrance, and be|gan a little &s;imple air.</P>
<LG>
<L>Ah, gentle hope! &s;hall I no more</L>
<L>Thy cheerful influence &s;hare?</L>
<L>Oh, mu&s;t I &s;till thy lo&s;s deplore,</L>

<L>Before the orient beam,</L>

They tempted her to continue a little longer at the in&s;trument: when &s;he ro&s;e from it, &s;he returned to the library, and began looking over the books, which &s;he found a col|lection of the be&s;t, which pa&s;t or pre&s;ent times had pro|duced.

<P>AMANDA went every morning to the Hall, where &s;he alternately played and read; in the evening &s;he again returned to it; but, in&s;tead of &s;taying in the library, generally took a book from thence, and read at the foot of &s;ome old mo&s;s-covered tree, delighted to hear its branches gently ru&s;tling over head, and myriads of &s;ummer flies buzzing in the &s;unny ray, from which &s;he was &s;heltered. When &s;he could no longer &s;ee to read, &s;he depo&s;ited her book in the place &s;he had taken it from, and rambled to the deepe&s;t rece&s;&s;es of the grove: this was the time &s;he loved to &s;aunter carele&s;sly along, while all the jarring pa&s;&s;ions that obtruding care excited, were hu&s;hed to peace by the &s;olemnity and &s;ilence of the hour, and the &s;oul felt at once compo&s;ed and eleva|ted:
<PB N="48" REF="038416_0047_1011E196E964DCE0">
this was the time &s;he loved to think on days de|parted, and &s;ketch tho&s;e &s;cenes of felicity, which, &s;he tru&s;ted, the days to come would realize. Sometimes &s;he gave way to all the enthu&s;ia&s;m of a young and romantic fancy, and pictured to her&s;elf the time, when the &s;hades &s;he wandered beneath, were

<P>Her health gradually grew better, as the tranquility of her mind increa&s;ed: a faint blu&s;h again began to tinge her cheek, and her lovely eyes beamed a placid lu&s;tre, through their long &s;ilken la&s;hes.</P>
<P>She returned one evening from her u&s;ual ramble with one of tho&s;e unaccountable depre&s;&s;ions on her &s;pirits to which to a greater or le&s;&s;er degree, almo&s;t every one is &s;ubject. When &s;he retired to bed, her &s;leeping thoughts took the tincture of her waking ones, and images of the mo&s;t affecting nature aro&s;e in her mind: &s;he went through the whole &s;tory of her mother's &s;uffer|ings, and &s;uddenly dreamt &s;he beheld her expiring under the greate&s;t torture; and that while &s;he wept her fate, the clouds opened, and di&s;covered her adorned with &s;eraphic beauty, bending with a benignant look towards her child, as if to a&s;&s;ure her of her pre&s;ent happine&s;s. From this dream Amanda was rou&s;ed, by the &s;ofte&s;t, &s;weete&s;t &s;trains of mu&s;ic &s;he had ever heard: &s;he &s;tarted with amazement; &s;he opened her eyes, and &s;aw a light around her, far exceeding that of twilight. Her dream had made a deep impre&s;&s;ion on her, and a &s;olemn awe diffu&s;ed it&s;elf over her mind; &s;he trembled univer&s;ally; but &s;oon did the emotion of awe give way to that of &s;urprize, when &s;he heard on the out&s;ide of the window the following lines from cowley, &s;ung in a manly and

exqui&s;itely melodious voice, the mu&s;ic which woke her being only a &s;ymphony to them.</P>
<LG>
<L>A wake, awake, my lyre,</L>

<P>Ere the voice cea&s;ed, Amanda had quite &s;haken off the effects of her dream; and when all again was &s;ilent, &s;he drew back the curtain, and &s;aw it was the moon, then at the full, which, beaming through the calico win|dow curtains, ca&s;t &s;uch a light around her. The remain|der of the night was pa&s;&s;ed in ruminating on this &s;trange
<PB N="50" REF="038416_0049_1011E19BD7363ED8">
incident: it was evident the &s;erenade was addre&s;&s;ed to her; but &s;he had not &s;een any one &s;ince her arrival in the neighbourhood, from whom &s;he could have expected &s;uch a compliment, or, indeed, believed capable of paying it; that the per&s;on who paid it, was one of no mean accompli&s;hments, from his performance &s;he could not doubt. She re&s;olved to conceal the incident, but to make &s;uch inquiries the next morning, as might po&s;&s;ibly lead to a di&s;covery. From the an&s;wers tho&s;e inquiries received, the clergyman was the only per&s;on, whom with any degree of probability, &s;he could fix on: &s;he had never &s;een him and was at a lo&s;s to conceive how he knew any thing of her, till it occurred he might have &s;een her going to Tudor Hall, or rambling about it.</P>
<P>From the moment this idea aro&s;e, Amanda deemed it imprudent to go to the Hall; yet, &s;o great was the plea&s;ure &s;he experienced there, &s;he could not think of relinqui&s;hing it without the greate&s;t reluctance. She at la&s;t con&s;idered, if &s;he had a companion, it would re|move any appearance of impropriety; Ellen was gene|rally employed at knitting; Amanda therefore &s;aw, that going to the Hall could not interfere with her em|ployment and accordingly a&s;ked her attendance thither, which the other joyfully agreed to.</P>
<P>"While you look over the books," &s;aid Ellen, as they entered the library, "I will ju&s;t &s;tep away about a little bu&s;ine&s;s." "I beg you may not be long ab&s;ent," cried Amanda. Ellen a&s;&s;ured her &s;he would not, and flew off directly. She had in truth &s;een, in an in|clo&s;ure near the Hall, Tim Chip the carpenter, at work, who was the rural Adonis of the&s;e &s;hades: he had long &s;elected Ellen for the fair nymph of his affec|tion; which di&s;tinction excited not a little jealou&s;y among the village girls, and con&s;iderably increa&s;ed the vanity of Ellen, who triumphed in a conque&s;t that at once gratified her love, and exalted her above her com|panions.</P>
<P>Amanda entered the mu&s;ic room; the melodious &s;train &s;he had heard the preceding night, dwelt upon her me|mory, and &s;he &s;at down to the piano, and attempted them; her ear &s;oon informed her the attempt was &s;uc|ce&s;sful;
<PB N="51" REF="038416_0050_1011E19F27A206D0">
and her voice (as the words were familiar to her) then accompanied the in&s;trument. "Heavenly &s;ounds!" exclaimed &s;ome one behind her, as &s;he con|cluded &s;inging. Amanda &s;tarted in terror and confu|&s;ion from the chair, and beheld a tall and elegant young man &s;tanding by it. "Good heaven!" cried &s;he, blu&s;h|ing, and ha&s;tily moving to the door, &s;carcely knowing what &s;he &s;aid, "where can Ellen be?" "And do you think," &s;aid the &s;tranger, &s;pringing forward, and inter|cepting her pa&s;&s;age, "I &s;hall let you e&s;cape in this manner? No, really, my charming girl, I &s;hould be the mo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible of beings, if I did not avail my&s;elf of the happy opportunity chance afforded, of entreating leave to be introduced to you." As he &s;poke, he gently &s;eized her hand, and carried it to his lips. "Be a&s;&s;ur|ed, Sir," &s;aid Amanda, "the chance, as you call it, which brought us together, is to me mo&s;t unplea&s;ant, as I fear it has expo&s;ed me to greater freedom than I have been accu&s;tomed to."</P>
<P>"And is it po&s;&s;ible," &s;aid he, "you really feel an emotion of anger? Well, I will relinqui&s;h my lovely captive, if &s;he conde&s;cendingly promi&s;es to continue here a few minutes longer, and grants me permi&s;&s;ion to attend her home."</P>
<P>"I in&s;i&s;t on being immediately relea&s;ed," exclaim|ed Amanda. "I obey," cried he, &s;oftly pre&s;&s;ing her hand, and then re&s;igning it&mdash;"yon are free, would to heaven I could &s;ay the &s;ame."</P>
<P>Amanda hurried to the grove; but in her confu&s;ion took a wrong path, and vainly ca&s;t her eyes around in &s;earch of Ellen. The &s;tranger followed, and his eyes wandered with her's in every direction they took. "And why," cried he, "&s;o unpropitious to my wi&s;h of intro|duction? A wi&s;h, it was impo&s;&s;ible not to feel from the moment you were &s;een." Amanda made no reply, but &s;till hurried on; and her fatigue and agitation were &s;oon too much for her pre&s;ent weak &s;tate of health; and quite overpowered, &s;he was at la&s;t compelled to &s;top, and lean again&s;t a tree for &s;upport. Exerci&s;e had diffu&s;ed its &s;ofte&s;t bloom over her cheek; her hair
<PB N="52" REF="038416_0051_1011E1A0B5BCAB08">
fluttered in the breeze that played around her; and her eyes, with the beautiful embarra&s;&s;ment of mode&s;ty, were bent to the ground, to avoid the &s;tranger's ardent gaze: he watched her with looks of the mo&s;t impa&s;&s;ion|ed admiration, and &s;oftly exclaimed, as if the involun|tary exclamation of rapture, "good heavens, what an angel!"</P>
<P>Fatigue has made you ill," he &s;aid, "and 'tis your ha&s;te to avoid me, has occa&s;ioned this di&s;order. Could you look into my heart, you would then find there was no rea&s;on to fly from me: the emotions that lovely face excites in a &s;oul of &s;en&s;ibility, could never be inimical to your &s;afety."</P>
<P>At this moment Amanda perceived Ellen leaping over a &s;tile, &s;he had at la&s;t left Mr. Chip, after promi|&s;ing to meet him in the evening at the cottage, where the blind harper was to attend to give them a dance. She ran forward: but, on &s;eeing the &s;tranger, &s;tarted back in the utmo&s;t amazement. "Ble&s;s me," &s;aid Amanda, "I thought you would never come."</P>
<P>"You go then," &s;aid the &s;tranger, "and give me no hope of a &s;econd interview. Oh &s;ay, taking her hand, "will you not allow me to wait upon you?" "It is ut|terly impo&s;&s;ible," replied Amanda, "and I &s;hall be quite di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, if longer detained."</P>
<P>"See then," &s;aid he, opening a gate which led from the grove into the road, "how like a courteous knight I relea&s;e you from painful captivity. But think not, thou beautiful though cruel fair one," he continued gai|ly, "I &s;hall re&s;ign my hopes of yet conquering thy obduracy."</P>
<P>"Oh Lord!" cried Ellen, as they quitted the grove, "how did you meet Lord Mortimer?" "Lord Morti|mer?" repeated Amanda. "Yes, him&s;elf, indeed," &s;aid Ellen, "and I think in all my por<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> days I was ne|ver more &s;urpri&s;ed, than when I &s;aw him with you, looking &s;o &s;oft and &s;o &s;weet upon you; to be &s;ure he is a beautiful man; and be&s;ides that, the young Lort of Tudor Hall." Amanda's &s;pirits were great|ly flurried, when &s;he heard he was the ma&s;ter of
<PB N="53" REF="038416_0052_1011E1A374D544C0">
the man&s;ion, where he had found her &s;eated with as much compo&s;ure as if po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of it.</P>
<P>As they were entering the cottage, Ellen, twitching Amanda's &s;leeve, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ried, "look, look." Amanda has|tily turning round, perceived Lord Mortimer, who had &s;lowly followed them half way down the lane; on being ob&s;erved, he &s;miled and ki&s;&s;ing his hand, retired.</P>
<P>Nur&s;e was quite delighted at her child being &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">en by Lord Mortimer (which Ellen informed her of:) her beauty &s;he was convinced, had excited his warme&s;t admiration; and admiration might lead (&s;he did not doubt) to &s;omething more important. Amanda's heart fluttered with an agreeable &s;en&s;ation, as Ellen de&s;cribed to her mother the tender looks with which Lord Morti|mer regarded her. She was at fir&s;t inclined to believe that in his lord&s;hip &s;he had found the per&s;on, who&s;e me|lody &s;o agreeably di&s;turbed her &s;lumbers; but a minute's reflection convinced her this belief mu&s;t be erroneous: it was evident (or &s;he would have heard of it) that Lord Mortimer had only arrived that day at Tudor-Hall; and even had he &s;een her before, upon con&s;idera|tion &s;he thought it improbable, that he &s;hould have ta|ken the trouble of coming in &s;uch a manner to a per&s;on in a &s;tation, to all appearance, &s;o infinitely beneath his own. Yes, it was plain, chance alone had led him to the apartment where &s;he &s;at; and the common place gal|lantry fa&s;hionable men are accu&s;tomed to, had dictated the language <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> addre&s;&s;ed to her. She half &s;ighed, as &s;he &s;ettled the matter thus in her mind, and again fixed on the curate as the &s;erenader. Well, &s;he was deter|mined, if ever he came in her way, and dropt a hint of an attachment, &s;he would immediately cru&s;h any hopes he might have the vanity to entertain.</P>

<P>AFTER tea Amanda a&s;ked little Bet&s;ey to accompany her in a walk: for Ellen, (dre&s;t in all her rural finery) had gone early in the evening to the dance. But Amanda did not begin her walk with her u&s;ual ala|crity: her bonnet was &s;o heavy, and then it made her look &s;o ill, that &s;he could not go out till &s;he had made &s;ome alterations in it; &s;till it would not do; a hat was tried on; &s;he liked it better, and at la&s;t &s;et out; but not as u&s;ual did &s;he pau&s;e, whenever a new or lovely feature in the land&s;cape &s;truck her view, to expre&s;s her admiration: &s;he was often indeed &s;o ab&s;orbed in thought as to &s;tart when Bet&s;ey addre&s;&s;ed her, which was often the ca&s;e; for little Bet&s;ey delighted to have Mi&s;s A|manda trace figures for her in the clouds, and a&s;&s;i&s;t her in gathering wild flowers. Scarcely knowing which way they went, Amanda rambled to the village; and feeling her&s;elf fatigued, turned into the church-yard to re&s;t upon one of the rai&s;ed flags.</P>
<P>The graves were ornamented with garlands of cut pa|per, interwoven with flowers; tributes of love from the village maids to the memory of their departed friends.</P>
<P>As Amanda re&s;ted her&s;elf, &s;he twined a garland of the wild flowers &s;he had gathered with Bet&s;ey, and hung it over the grave of Lady Malvina: her fine eyes rai&s;ed to heaven, as if invoking at the moment the &s;pirit of her mother, to regard the vernal offering of her child; while her white hands were folded on her heart, and &s;he &s;oftly exclaimed, "Alas, is this the on|ly tribute left for me to pay!"</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="038416_0054_1011E1A8E753DF00">
A low murmur, as if from voices near, &s;tartled her at the in&s;tant; &s;he turned with quickne&s;s and &s;aw Lord Mortimer with a young clergyman, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">alf hid by &s;ome trees, attentively ob&s;erving her. Blu&s;hing and confu|&s;ed, &s;he drew her hat over her face, and catching Bet|&s;ey's hand, ha&s;tened to the cottage.</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer had wandered about the &s;kirts of the cottage, in hopes of meeting her in the evening: on &s;eeing the direction &s;he had taken from it, he followed her: and ju&s;t as &s;he entered the church-yard, unexpect|edly met the curate. His company, at a moment &s;o propitious for joining Amanda, he could well have di&s;|pen&s;ed with: for he was more anxious than he cho&s;e to acknowledge to him&s;elf, to become acquainted with her.</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer was now in the glowing prime of life: his per&s;on was &s;trikingly elegant, and his manners in&s;inuatingly plea&s;ing; &s;educing &s;weetne&s;s dwelt in his &s;mile, and, as he plea&s;ed, his expre&s;&s;ive eyes could &s;parkle with intelligence, or beam with &s;en&s;ibility; and to the eloquence of his language, the harmony of his voice imparted a charm, that &s;eldom failed of being irre&s;i&s;tible; his &s;oul was naturally the &s;eat of every vir|tue; but an elevated rank, and &s;plendid fortune, had placed him in a &s;ituation &s;omewhat inimical to their intere&s;ts, for he had not always &s;trength to re&s;i&s;t the &s;trong temptations which &s;urrounded him; but though he &s;ometimes wandered from the boundaries of virtue he had never yet entered upon the confines of vice, never really injured innocence, or done a deed which could wound the bo&s;om of a friend; his heart was alive to every noble propen&s;ity of nature; compa&s;&s;ion was one of its &s;tronge&s;t feelings, and never did his hand refu&s;e obedience to the generous impul&s;e. Among the vari|ous accompli&s;hments he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, was an exqui&s;ite ta&s;te for mu&s;ic, which, with every other talent, had been cultivated to the highe&s;t degree of po&s;&s;ible perfec|tion; his &s;pending many years abroad had given him every requi&s;ite advantage for improving it. The &s;oft, melodious voice of Amanda would of it&s;elf almo&s;t have
<PB N="56" REF="038416_0055_1011E1AA78772F58">
made a conque&s;t of his heart; but aided by the charms of her face and per&s;on altogether were irre&s;i&s;tible.</P>
<P>He had come into Wales, on purpo&s;e to pay a vi&s;it to an old friend in the I&s;le of Angle&s;ey: he did not mean to &s;top at Tudor-Hall; but within a few miles of it the phae|ton in which he travelled, (from the finene&s;s of the wea|ther) was overturned, and he &s;everely hurt. He procured a hired carriage, and proceeded to the Hall, to put him&s;elf into the hands of the good old hou&s;ekeeper, Mrs. Aberg|willy; who, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing as great a &s;tock of medical knowledge as Lady Bountiful her&s;elf, he believed would cure his brui&s;es with as much, or rather more expedition, than any country &s;urgeon whatever. He gave &s;trict or|ders, that his being at the Hall &s;hould not be mentioned, as he did not chu&s;e the few days he hoped and believed he &s;hould continue there, to be di&s;turbed by vi&s;its, which he knew would be paid, if an intimation of his being there was received. From an apartment adjoining the mu&s;ic room he had di&s;covered Amanda; though &s;carce|ly able to move, at the fir&s;t &s;ound of her voice he &s;tole to the door, which being a little open, gave him an opportunity of &s;eeing her perfectly; and nothing but his &s;ituation prevented his immediately appearing before her, and expre&s;&s;ing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he admiration &s;he had in&s;pired him with. As &s;oon as &s;he departed, he &s;ent for the hou&s;e|keeper, to inquire who the beautiful &s;tranger was. Mrs. Abergwilly only knew &s;he was a young lady lately come from London to lodge at David Edwin's cottage, who&s;e wife had intreated permi&s;&s;ion for her to read in the libra|ry, which &s;he added, &s;he had given, &s;eeing that his Lord|&s;hip read in the dre&s;&s;ing-room; but, if he plea&s;ed, &s;he would &s;end Mi&s;s Dunford word not to come again. "By no means," his Lord&s;hip &s;aid. Amanda therefore con|tinued her vi&s;its as u&s;ual, little thinking with what cri|tical regard and fond admiration &s;he was ob&s;erved. Lord Mortimer daily grew better; but the purpo&s;e for which he had come into Wales, &s;eemed utterly forgotten; he had a tincture of romance in his di&s;po&s;ition and availed him&s;elf of his recovery to gratify it, by taking a lute, and &s;erenading his lovely cottage girl. He could no long|er
<PB N="57" REF="038416_0056_1011E1AD1300F5B0">
re&s;train his impatience to be known to her: and the next day &s;tealing from his retirement, &s;urpri&s;ed her as already related.</P>
<P>As he could not, without an utter violation of good manners, &s;hake off Howell, he contented him&s;elf with following Amanda into the church-yard, where, &s;haded by the trees, he and his companion &s;tood watching her unnoticed, till an involuntary exclamation of rapture from his Lord&s;hip di&s;covered their &s;ituation. When &s;he departed, he read the in&s;cription on the tomb-&s;tone; but, from the difference of names, this gave no in|&s;ight into any connexion between her and the per&s;on it mentioned: Howell could give no information of either; he was but a young man, lately appointed to the par&s;onage, and had never &s;een Amanda till that evening.</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer, was &s;olicitous even to a degree of anxiety, to learn the real &s;ituation of Amanda: as Howell in his pa&s;toral function, had free acce&s;s to the hou&s;es of his pari&s;hioners, it occurred to him, that he would be an excellent per&s;on, to di&s;cover it; he there|fore, as if from curio&s;ity alone, expre&s;&s;ed his wi&s;h of knowing who &s;he was, and reque&s;ted Howell, if conve|nient, to follow her directly to Edwin's cottage, (where, he &s;aid, by chance, he heard &s;he lodged) and endeavor to find out from the good people every thing about her. This reque&s;t Howell readily complied with; the face, the figure, the melancholy, and above all the employment of Amanda, had intere&s;ted his &s;en&s;ibility, and excited his curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>He arrived &s;oon after her at the cottage, and found her laughing at her nur&s;e, who was telling her, &s;he was certain &s;he &s;hould &s;ee her a great laty. Amanda ro&s;e to retire at his entrance; but he perceiving her intention, declared, if he di&s;turbed her, he would immediately de|part: &s;he accordingly re-&s;eated her&s;elf, &s;ecretly plea&s;ed at doing &s;o, as &s;he thought, either from &s;ome look or word of the curate's, &s;he might di&s;cover if he really was the per&s;on who had &s;erenaded her; from this idea &s;he &s;hewed no aver&s;ene&s;s to enter into conver&s;ation with him.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="038416_0057_1011E1AF80EA0DF8">
The whole family, nur&s;e excepted, had followed Ellen to the dance; and that good woman thought &s;he could do no le&s;s for the honor of Howell's vi&s;it, than prepare a little comfortable &s;upper for him. The bene|volence of his di&s;po&s;ition, and innocent gaiety of his temper, had rendered him a great favorite among&s;t his ru&s;tic neighbours, whom he frequently amu&s;ed with &s;imple ballads and plea&s;ant tales. Amanda and he were left tete-a-tete, while the nur&s;e was bu&s;ied in preparing her entertainment; and &s;he was &s;oon as much plea&s;ed with the elegance and &s;implicity of his manners, as he was with the innocence and &s;weetne&s;s of her's. The objects about them naturally led to rural &s;ubjects, and from them to what might almo&s;t be termed a di&s;&s;erta|tion on poetry: this was a theme peculiarly agreeable to Howell, who wooed the pen&s;ive mu&s;e beneath the &s;yl|van &s;hade; nor was it le&s;s &s;o to Amanda; &s;he was a zealous wor&s;hipper of the Mu&s;es, though diffidence made her conceal her invocations to them. She was led to point out the beauties of her favorite authors; and the &s;oft &s;en&s;ibility of her voice rai&s;ed a kind of tender enthu&s;ia&s;m in Howell's &s;oul: he gazed and li&s;|tened, as if his eye could never be &s;atisfied with &s;eeing, or his ear with hearing. At his particular reque&s;t, Amanda recited the pathetic de&s;cription of the curate and his lovely daughter, from the De&s;erted village; a tear &s;tole down her cheek as &s;he proceeded. Howell &s;oftly laid his hand on her's, and exclaimed, "Good heavens, what an angel!"</P>
<P>"Come, come," &s;aid Amanda, &s;miling at the ener|gy with which he &s;poke, "you, at lea&s;t, &s;hould have nothing to do with flattery."</P>
<P>"Flattery!" repeated he emphatically, "Oh hea|vens, did you but know my &s;incerity&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Well, well," cried &s;he, wi&s;hing to change the &s;ubject, "utter no expre&s;&s;ion in future, which &s;hall make me doubt it."</P>
<P>"To flatter you," &s;aid he, "would be impo&s;&s;ible; &s;ince the highe&s;t eulogium mu&s;t be inadequate to your merits."</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="038416_0058_1011E1B2ACD41300">
"Again!" &s;aid Amanda.</P>
<P>"Believe me," he replied, "flattery is a meanne&s;s I abhor; the expre&s;&s;ions you denominate as &s;uch, proceed from emotions, I &s;hould contemn my&s;elf for want of &s;en&s;ibility, if I did not experience&mdash;"</P>
<P>The nur&s;e's duck and green peas were now &s;et upon the table, but in vain did &s;he pre&s;s Howell to eat; his eyes were too well fea&s;ted, to allow him to attend to his palate. Finding her entreaties ineffectual in one re&s;pect, &s;he tried them in another, and begged he would &s;ing a favourite old ballad; this he at fir&s;t he&s;itated to do, till Amanda, (from a &s;ecret motive of her own) joined in the entreaty; and the moment &s;he heard his voice, &s;he was convinced he was not the per&s;on who had been at the out&s;ide of the window. After his complai|&s;ance to her, &s;he could not refu&s;e him one &s;ong: the melodious &s;ounds &s;unk into his heart; he &s;eemed fa&s;ci|nated to the &s;pot, nor thought of moving, till the nur&s;e gave him a hint for that purpo&s;e, being afraid of Aman|da's &s;itting up too late.</P>
<P>He &s;ighed as he entered his humble dwelling; it was perhaps the fir&s;t &s;igh he had ever heaved for the narrow|ne&s;s of his fortune. "Yet," cried he, ca&s;ting his eyes around, "in this abode, low and humble as it is, a &s;oul like Amanda's might enjoy felicity.</P>
<P>The purpo&s;e for which Lord Mortimer &s;ent him to the cottage, and Lord Mortimer him&s;elf, were forgotten. His Lord&s;hip had engaged Howell to &s;up with him, af|ter the performance of his emba&s;&s;y, and impatiently waited his arrival: he felt di&s;plea&s;ed, as the hours wore away without bringing him; and unable at la&s;t to re|&s;train the impetuo&s;ity of his feelings, proceeded to the par&s;onage, which he entered a few minutes after Howell. He a&s;ked, with no great complacency, the rea&s;on he had not fulfilled his engagement. Ab&s;orbed in one idea, Howell felt confu&s;ed, agitated, and unable to frame any excu&s;e; he therefore &s;imply &s;aid, what in reality was true, that he had utterly forgotten it.</P>
<P>"I &s;uppo&s;e then," exclaimed Lord Mortimer in a ruf|fled
<PB N="60" REF="038416_0059_1011E1B43AE247A0">
voice, "you have been very agreeably entertain|ed."</P>
<P>"Delightfully," &s;aid Howell.</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer grew more di&s;plea&s;ed; but his anger was now levelled again&s;t him&s;elf as well as Howell. He repented and regretted the folly which had thrown Howell in the way of &s;uch temptation, and had perhaps rai&s;ed a rival to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"Well," cried he, after a few ha&s;ty paces about the room, "and pray, what do you know about Mi&s;s Dun|ford?"</P>
<P>"About her?" repeated Howell, as if &s;tarting from a reverie&mdash;"why&mdash;nothing."</P>
<P>"Nothing!" re-echoed his Lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>"No," replied Howell, "except that &s;he is an an|gel."</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer was now thoroughly convinced, all was over with the poor par&s;on; and re&s;olved in con&s;e|quence of this conviction, to lo&s;e no time him&s;elf. He could not depart, without inquiring how the evening had been &s;pent, and envied Howell the happy minutes he &s;o eloquently de&s;cribed.</P>

"From Lord Mortimer!" &s;aid Amanda, with invo|luntary emotion. "Well, this really has a&s;toni&s;hed me."</P>
<P>"Oh lort, my tear!" cried the nur&s;e in a rapture.</P>
<P>Amanda waved her hand to &s;ilence her, as the &s;er|vant &s;tood in the out&s;ide room. She called Bet&s;ey: "tell the &s;ervant," &s;aid &s;he,&mdash;</P>
<P>"Lort," cried the nur&s;e &s;oftly, and twitching her &s;leeve, "write his Lort&s;hip a little pit of a note, ju&s;t to let him &s;ee what a pretty &s;cribe you are."</P>
<P>Amanda could not refrain &s;miling; but di&s;engaging her&s;elf from the good woman, &s;he aro&s;e and going to the &s;ervant, de&s;ired him to tell his Lord &s;he thanked him for his polite attention; but that in future it would not be in her power to go to the library. When &s;he re|turned to the room, the nur&s;e bitterly lamented her not writing. "Great matters," &s;he &s;aid '"had often ari|&s;en from &s;mall beginnings." She could not conceive why his Lort&s;hip &s;hould be treated in &s;uch a manner: it was not the way &s;he had ever &s;erved her Edwin. Lort, &s;he remembered, if &s;he got but the &s;crawl of a pen from him, &s;he u&s;ed to &s;it up to an&s;wer it. Aman|da tried to per&s;uade her it was neither nece&s;&s;ary or pro|per for her to write. An hour pa&s;&s;ed in arguments be|tween them, when two &s;ervants came from Tudor Hall to the cottage, with a &s;mall book-ca&s;e, which they &s;ent in to Amanda, and their Lord's compliments, that in a few minutes he would have the honor of paying his re|&s;pects to her.</P>
<P>Amanda felt agitated by this me&s;&s;age; but it was the agitation of involuntary plea&s;ure. Her room was always perfectly neat, yet did the nur&s;e and her two daughters now bu&s;y them&s;elves with trying, if po&s;&s;ible, to put it into nicer order: the garden was ran&s;acked for the choice&s;t flowers to ornament it; nor would they de|part, till they &s;aw Lord Mortimer approaching. Aman|da, who had opened the book-ca&s;e, then &s;natched up a book, to avoid the appearance of &s;itting in expectation of his coming.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="038416_0062_1011E1BC12D3A038">
He entered with an air at once ea&s;y and re&s;pectful, and taking her hand be&s;ought forgivene&s;s for his in|tru&s;ion the preceding day. Amanda blu&s;hed, and faul|tered out &s;omething of the confu&s;ion &s;he had experien|ced from being &s;o &s;urpri&s;ed: he re-&s;eated her, and draw|ing a chair clo&s;e to her's, &s;aid he had taken the liberty of &s;ending her a few books to amu&s;e her, till &s;he again conde&s;cended to vi&s;it the library, which he entreated her to do; promi&s;ing that, if &s;he plea&s;ed, both it and the mu&s;ic-room &s;hould be &s;acred to her alone. She thanked him for his politene&s;s; but declared &s;he mu&s;t be ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;ed from going. Lord Mortimer regarded her with a degree of tender admiration; an admiration heightened by the contra&s;t he drew in his mind between her and the generality of fa&s;hionable women he had &s;een, whom he often &s;ecretly cen&s;ured for &s;acrificing too largely at the &s;hrine of art and fa&s;hion. The pale and varied blu&s;h which mantled the cheek of Amanda, at once announced it&s;elf to be an involuntary &s;uffu&s;ion; and her dre&s;s was only remarkable for its &s;implicity: &s;he wore a plain robe of dimity, and an abbey cap of thin mu&s;lin, that &s;haded without concealing her face, and gave to it the &s;oft expre&s;&s;ion of a Madona; her beautiful hair fell in long ringlets down her back, and curled upon her forehead.</P>
<P>"Good Heaven!" cried Lord Mortimer, "how has your idea dwelt upon my mind &s;ince la&s;t night: if in the morning I was charmed, in the evening I was enrap|tured. Your looks, your attitude, were then beyond all that imagination could conceive of loveline&s;s and grace: you appeared as a being of another world, mourn|ing over a kindred &s;pirit. I felt</P>
<P>Awe-&s;truck, and as I pa&s;&s;ed, I wor&s;hipped."</P>
<P>Confu&s;ed by the energy of his words, and the ardent glances he directed towards her, Amanda, &s;carcely knowing what &s;he did, turned over the leaves of the book &s;he &s;till held in her hand: in doing &s;o, &s;he &s;aw written on the title-page, the Earl of Cherbury "Cherbury!" repeated &s;he, in a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="038416_0063_1011E1BD9F9E3148">
"Do you know him?" a&s;ked Lord Mortimer.</P>
<P>"Not per&s;onally; but I revere, I e&s;teem him: he is one of the be&s;t, the true&s;t friends, my father ever had."</P>
<P>"Oh how happy," exclaimed Lord Mortimer, "would his &s;on be, were he capable of in&s;piring you with &s;uch &s;entiments as you avow for him."</P>
<P>"His &s;on!" repeated Amanda, in a tone of &s;urpri&s;e, and looking at Lord Mortimer.</P>
<P>"Yes," replied he. "Is it then po&s;&s;ible," he con|tinued, "that you are really ignorant of his being my father!"</P>
<P>Surpri&s;e kept her &s;ilent a few minutes; for her father had never given her any account of the earl's family, till about the period he thought of applying to him; and her mind was &s;o di&s;tracted at that time on his own ac|count, that &s;he &s;carcely under&s;tood a word he uttered&punc; In the country &s;he had never heard Lord Cherbury mention|ed; for Tudor-Hall belonged not to him, but to Lord Mortimer, to whom an uncle had bequeathed it.</P>
<P>"I thought, indeed, my Lord," &s;aid Amanda, as &s;oon as &s;he recovered her voice, "that your Lord&s;hip's title was familiar to me: though why, from the hurry and perplexity in which peculiar circum&s;tances involved me I could not tell."</P>
<P>"Oh, &s;uffer," cried Lord Mortimer, with one of his mo&s;t in&s;inuating &s;miles, "the friend&s;hip our pa|rents feel to be continued to their children&mdash;let this," taking her &s;oft hand, and pre&s;&s;ing his lips to it, "be the pledge of amity between us." He now inquired, when the intimacy between her father and his had commenc|ed, and where the former was; but from tho&s;e inquiries Amanda &s;hrunk. She reflected that without her father's permi&s;&s;ion &s;he had no right to an&s;wer them; and that, in a &s;ituation like his and her's, too much caution could not be ob&s;erved. Be&s;ides both pride and delicacy made her &s;olicitous at pre&s;ent to conceal her father's real &s;itua|tion from Lord Mortimer; &s;he could not bear to think it &s;hould be known, his &s;ole dependence was on Lord Cherbury, uncertain, as it was, whether that nobleman would ever an&s;wer his expectations. She repented having
<PB N="65" REF="038416_0064_1011E1C032F2E090">
ever dropped a hint of the intimacy &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between them, which &s;urpri&s;e alone had made her do; and tried to wave the &s;ubject. In this de&s;ign Lord Mortimer a&s;|&s;i&s;ted her; for he had too much penetration, not in&s;tant|ly to perceive it confu&s;ed and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed her. He reque&s;t|ed permi&s;&s;ion to renew his vi&s;it; but Amanda, though well inclined to grant his reque&s;t, yielded to prudence in&s;tead of inclination, and begged he would excu&s;e her; the &s;eeming di&s;parity, (&s;he could not help &s;aying) in their &s;ituations would render it very imprudent in her to receive &s;uch vi&s;its; &s;he blu&s;hed, half-&s;ighed, and bent her eyes to the ground, as &s;he &s;poke. Lord Mor|timer continued to entreat, but &s;he was &s;teady in refu|&s;ing; he would not depart however, till he had obtained permi&s;&s;ion to attend her in the evening to a part of Tu|dor Grove, which &s;he had never yet &s;een, and he de&s;|cribed as particularly beautiful. He wanted to call for her at the appointed hour, but &s;he would not &s;uffer this; and he was compelled to be contented with leave to meet her near the cottage, when it came.</P>
<P>With a beating heart &s;he kept her appointment, and found his lord&s;hip not many yards di&s;tant from the cot|tage, impatiently waiting her approach. A brighter bloom than u&s;ual glowed upon her cheek, as &s;he li&s;ten|ed to his ardent expre&s;&s;ions of admiration; yet not to &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions, which would &s;oon have &s;ated an ear of delicacy like Amanda's, did Lord Mortimer confine him&s;elf; he conver&s;ed on various &s;ubjects; and the elo|quence of his languge, the liveline&s;s of his imagination, and the ju&s;tne&s;s of his remarks, equally amu&s;ed and in|tere&s;ted his fair companion. There was indeed, in the di&s;po&s;ition and manners of Lord Mortimer, that happy mixture of animation and &s;oftne&s;s, which at once amus|es the fancy and attracts the heart; and never had Amanda experienced &s;uch minutes as &s;he now pa&s;&s;ed with him; &s;o delightful in their progre&s;s, &s;o rapid in their cour&s;e. On entering the walk he had mentioned to her, &s;he &s;aw he had not exaggerated its beauties: after pa&s;&s;ing through many long and &s;haded alleys, they
<PB N="66" REF="038416_0065_1011E1C353E648B8">
came to a &s;mooth green lawn, about which the trees ro&s;e in the form of an amphitheatre, and their dark, lux|uriant, and chequered &s;hades proclaimed, that among&s;t them

<P>The lawn gently &s;loped to a winding &s;tream, &s;o clear as perfectly to reflect the beautiful &s;cenery of heaven, now glowing with the gold and purple of the &s;etting &s;un, from the oppo&s;ite bank of the &s;tream ro&s;e a &s;tupendous mountain, diver&s;ified with little verdant hills and dales, and &s;kirted with a wild &s;hrubbery, who&s;e blo&s;&s;oms per|fumed the air with the mo&s;t balmy fragrance. Lord Mortimer prevailed on Amanda to &s;it down upon a ru&s;|tic bench beneath the &s;preading branches of an oak, en|wreathed with ivy; here they had not &s;at long, ere the &s;ilence which reigned around, was &s;uddenly interrupted by &s;trains, at once low, &s;olemn, and melodious, that &s;eem|ed to creep along the water, till they had reached the place where they &s;at; and then, as if a Naiad of the &s;tream had left her ru&s;hy couch to do them homage, they &s;welled by degrees into full melody, which the mountain echoes alternately revived and heightened. It appear|ed like enchantment to Amanda, and her eyes, turned to Lord Mortimer, &s;eemed to &s;ay, it was to his magic it was owing After enjoying her &s;urpri&s;e &s;ome minutes he acknowledged the mu&s;ic proceeded from two &s;ervants of his, who played on the clarinet and French horn, and were &s;tationed in a dell of the oppo&s;ite mountain. Notwith&s;tanding all her former thoughts to the contrary, Amanda now conceived a &s;trong &s;u&s;picion, that Lord Mortimer was really the per&s;on who had &s;erenaded her: that &s;he conceived plea&s;ure from the idea, is &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay; &s;he had rea&s;on &s;oon to find, &s;he was not mi&s;taken. Lord Mortimer &s;olicited her for the La|dy's &s;ong in Comus, &s;aying the pre&s;ent &s;ituation was pe|culiarly adapted to it: on her he&s;itating, he told her &s;he
<PB N="67" REF="038416_0066_1011E1C5C9CBCC18">
had no plea to offer for not complying, as he him&s;elf had heard her enchanting powers in it. Amanda &s;tarted, and eagerly enquired when or by what means. It was too late for his Lord&s;hip to recede; and he not only con|fe&s;&s;ed his concealment near the mu&s;ic-room, but his vi&s;it to her window. A &s;oft confu&s;ion, intermingled with plea&s;ure, pervaded the &s;oul of Amanda at this confe&s;|&s;ion: and it was &s;ome time ere &s;he was &s;ufficiently com|po&s;ed to comply with Lord Mortimer's &s;olicitations for her to &s;ing: &s;he at la&s;t allowed him to lead her to the centre of a little ru&s;tic bridge thrown over the &s;tream, from whence her voice could be &s;ufficiently di&s;tingui&s;hed for the mu&s;ic to keep time to it, as Lord Mortimer had directed. Her plaintive and harmonious invocation, an|&s;wered by the low breathing of the clarinet, which ap|peared like the &s;ofte&s;t echo of the mountain, had the fine&s;t effect immaginable, and "took the impri&s;on'd &s;oul, and wrapt it in Ely&s;ium."</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer, for the fir&s;t time in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, found him&s;elf at a lo&s;s to expre&s;s what he felt: he conducted her back to the &s;eat, where, to her a&s;toni&s;hment, &s;he beheld fruits, ices, and creams, laid out, as if by the hand of magic, for no mortal appeared near the &s;pot. Du&s;ky twilight now warned her to return home; but Lord Mortimer would not &s;uffer her to depart, till &s;he had partaken of this collation.</P>
<P>He was not by any means &s;atisfied with the idea of only beholding her for an hour or two of an evening; and when they came near the cottage, de&s;ired to know whether it was to chance alone he was in future to be indebted for &s;eeing her. Again he entreated permi&s;&s;ion to vi&s;it her &s;ometimes in the morning, promi&s;ing he would never di&s;turb her avocations, but would be &s;ati&s;|fied merely to &s;it and read to her, whenever &s;he cho&s;e to work, and felt her&s;elf inclined for that amu&s;ement: Amanda's refu&s;als grew fainter, and at la&s;t &s;he &s;aid, on the above-mentioned conditions, he might &s;ometimes come. That he availed him&s;elf of this permi&s;&s;ion is &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay; and from this time few hours pa&s;&s;ed without their &s;eeing each other.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="038416_0067_1011E1C7563A3750">
The cold re&s;erve of Amanda by degrees wore away; from her knowledge of his family, &s;he con&s;idered him as more than a new or common acquaintance. The emo|tions &s;he felt for him, &s;he thought &s;anctioned by that knowledge, and the gratitude &s;he felt for Lord Cherbury for his former conduct to her father, which claimed, &s;he thought, her re&s;pect and e&s;teem for &s;o near and valuable a connexion of his; the worth, &s;he could not help acknow|ledging to her&s;elf, of Lord Mortimer, would, of it&s;elf alone, have authorized them. Her heart felt he was one of the mo&s;t amiable, the mo&s;t plea&s;ing of men: &s;he could &s;carcely di&s;gui&s;e, in any degree, the lively plea&s;ure &s;he experienced in his &s;ociety; nay, &s;he &s;carcely thought it nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;gui&s;e it, for it re&s;ulted as much from in|nocence as &s;en&s;ibility, and was placed to the account of friend&s;hip. But Lord Mortimer was too penetrating, not &s;oon to perceive he might a&s;cribe it to a &s;ofter im|pul&s;e; with the mo&s;t delicate attention, the mo&s;t tender regard, he daily, nay hourly, in&s;inuated him&s;elf into her heart, and &s;ecured for him&s;elf an intere&s;t in it, ere &s;he was aware, which the efforts of &s;ub&s;equent re&s;olution could not overcome. He was the companion of her rambles, the alleviator of her griefs, the care which &s;o often &s;addened her brow, always vani&s;hed at his pre|&s;ence, and in conver&s;ing with him &s;he forgot every cau&s;e of &s;orrow.</P>
<P>He once or twice delicately hinted at tho&s;e circum|&s;tances which at his fir&s;t vi&s;it &s;he had mentioned, as &s;uf|ficiently di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to bewilder her recollection: Aman|da, with blu&s;hes, always &s;hrunk from the &s;ubject, &s;ick|ening at the idea of his knowing, that her father de|pended on his for future &s;upport. If he ever addre&s;&s;ed her &s;eriou&s;ly on the &s;ubject of the regard he profe&s;&s;ed for her, (which, from his attentions, &s;he could not help &s;ometimes flattering her&s;elf would be the ca&s;e) then indeed there would be no longer room for concealment; but except &s;uch a circum&s;tance took place, &s;he could not bring her&s;elf to make any humiliating di&s;covery.</P>
<P>Tudor Grove was the favorite &s;cene of their rambles: &s;ometimes &s;he allowed him to lead her to the mu&s;ic-room;
<PB N="69" REF="038416_0068_1011E1C9E837F1B8">
but as the&s;e vi&s;its were not frequent, a lute was brought from it to the cottage, and in the rece&s;s in the garden &s;he often &s;ung and played for the enraptured Mortimer; there too he frequently read for her, always &s;electing &s;ome elegant and pathetic piece of poetry, to which the harmony of his voice gave additional charms; a voice which &s;unk into the heart of Amanda, and in|tere&s;ted her &s;en&s;ibility even more than the &s;ubject he peru&s;ed.</P>
<P>Often &s;traying to the vall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y's verge, as they contem|plated the lovely pro&s;pect around, only bounded by di&s;|tant and &s;tupendous mountains, Lord Mortimer, in &s;trains of eloquence would de&s;cribe the beautiful &s;cenes and exten&s;ive land&s;capes beyond them; and whenever Amanda expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h, (as &s;he &s;ometimes would from thoughtle&s;s innocence) of viewing them, he would &s;oftly &s;igh, and wi&s;h he was to be her guide to them, as to point out beauties to a refined and cultivated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> like her's, would be to him the greate&s;t plea&s;ure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> could po&s;&s;ibly experience.</P>
<P>Seated &s;ometimes on the brow of a &s;hrubby hill, as they viewed the &s;cattered hamlets beneath, he would expatiate on the plea&s;ure he conceived there mu&s;t be, in pa&s;&s;ing a tranquil life with one lovely, and beloved ob|ject: his in&s;idious eyes, turned towards Amanda, at the&s;e minutes, &s;eemed to &s;ay, &s;he was the being who could realize all the ideas he entertained of &s;uch a life; and when he a&s;ked her opinion of his &s;entiments, her di&s;ordered blu&s;hes, and faultering accents, too plainly betrayed her con&s;cious feelings. Every delicacy which Tudor Hall contained, was daily &s;ent to the cottage, notwith&s;tanding Amanda's prohibition to the contrary; and &s;ometimes Lord Mortimer was permitted to dine with her in the rece&s;s. Three weeks &s;pent in this fami|liar manner, endeared and attached them to each other more than months would have done, pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ituations liable to interruption.</P>

<P>HOWELL was no &s;tranger to the man|ner in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> hours rolled away at the cottage; he ho|vered round it, and &s;eized every interval of Lord Mor|timer's ab&s;ence, to pre&s;ent him&s;elf before Amanda; his emotions betrayed his feelings, and Amanda affected re|&s;erve towards him, in hopes of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing his pa&s;&s;ion; a pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he <HI>now</HI> began to think, when hopele&s;s, mu&s;t be dreadful.</P>
<P>Howell was a prey to melancholy; but not for him|&s;elf alone did he mourn: fears for the &s;afety and happi|ne&s;s of Amanda added to his dejection; he dreaded that Lord Mortimer perhaps, like too many of the fa&s;hionable men, might make no &s;cruple of availing him&s;elf of any advantage which could be derived from a predilection in his favor.</P>
<P>He knew him, 'tis true, to be amiable; but in oppo|&s;ition to that, he knew him to be volatile, and &s;ometimes wild, and he trembled for the un&s;u&s;pecting credulity of Amanda. "Though lo&s;t to me," exclaimed the unhap|py young man, "oh never, &s;weete&s;t Amanda, maye&s;t thou be lo&s;t to thy&s;elf."</P>
<P>He had received many proofs of e&s;teem and friend&s;hip from Lord Mortimer; he therefore &s;tudied, how he
<PB N="71" REF="038416_0070_1011E1CF5261BFE0">
might admoni&s;h without offending, and &s;ave Amanda without injuring her&s;elf. It at la&s;t occurred that the pulpit would be the &s;ure&s;t way of effecting his wi&s;hes, where the &s;ubject addre&s;&s;ed to all, might particularly &s;trike the one for whom it was intended, with out appear|ing as if de&s;igned for that purpo&s;e; and timely convince him, if, indeed, he meditated any injurious de&s;ign again&s;t Amanda of its flagrance.</P>
<P>On the following Sunday, as he expected, Lord Mor|timer and Amanda attended &s;ervice; his Lord&s;hip's pew was oppo&s;ite the one &s;he &s;at in, and we fear his eyes too often wandered in that direction.</P>
<P>The youthful monitor at la&s;t a&s;cended the pulpit: his text was from Jeremiah, and to the following effect:</P>
<P>"She weepeth &s;ore in the night, and her tears <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> on her cheeks; among all her lovers &s;he hath none to com|fort her; all her friends have dealt treacherou&s;ly with her, they are become her enemies."</P>
<P>After a &s;light introduction in which he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that the declen&s;ion of moral principles demanded &s;uch an ex|hortation as he was about giving, he commenced his &s;ubject: he de&s;cribed a youg female, adorned with beauty and innocence, walking forward in the path of integrity, which a virtuous education had early marked for her to take, and rejoicing, as &s;he went, with all around her; when, in the mid&s;t of her happine&s;s, unexpected calamity &s;uddenly &s;urpri&s;ed, and precipitated her from pro&s;perity into the deepe&s;t di&s;tre&s;s; he de&s;cribed the benefits &s;he derived in this trying period, from early implanted virtue and religion; taught by them, (he proceeded) the lovely mourner turns not to the world for con&s;olation&mdash;no, &s;he looks up to her Creator for comfort, who&s;e &s;upporting aid is &s;o particularly promi&s;ed to afflicted worth. Cheered by them, &s;he is able to ex|ert the little talents of genius and ta&s;te, and draw upon indu&s;try for her future &s;upport: her active virtue, &s;he thinks the be&s;t proof of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion &s;he can give to the will of Heaven: and in the&s;e laudable exertions &s;he finds a con&s;cious peace, which the mere po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of fortune never could be&s;tow. While thus employed, a

&s;on of perfidy &s;ees and marks her for his prey, becau&s;e &s;he is at once lovely and helple&s;s; her un&s;u&s;pecting cre|dulity lays her open to his arts, and his blandi&s;hments by degrees allure her heart. The &s;nare which he has &s;pread at la&s;t involves her; with the incon&s;tancy of libertini&s;m he &s;oon de&s;erts her; and again is &s;he plunged into di&s;|tre&s;s. But mark the difference of her fir&s;t and &s;econd fall: con&s;cience no longer lends its oppo&s;ing aid to &s;tem her &s;orrow; de&s;pair in&s;tead of hope, ari&s;es; without one friend to &s;oothe the pangs of death, onepitying &s;oul to whisper peace to her departing &s;pirit; in&s;ulted too, perhaps, by &s;ome unfeeling being, whom want of &s;imilar temptations alone, perhaps &s;aved from &s;imilar impruden|cies; &s;he &s;inks an early victim to wretchedne&s;s. Howell pau&s;ed; the fulne&s;s of his heart mounted to his eyes, which involuntarily turned and re&s;ted upon Amanda: intere&s;ted by his &s;imple and pathetic eloquence, &s;he had ri&s;en, and leaned over the pew, her head re&s;ting on her hand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> her eyes fa&s;tened on his face. Lord Mortimer had al&s;o ri&s;en, and alternately gazed upon Howell and Amanda, particularly watching the latter to &s;ee how the &s;ubject would affect her. He at la&s;t &s;aw the tears trickling down her cheeks; the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of her own &s;ituation, and the &s;tratagems of Belgrave, made her, in &s;ome re&s;pects, perceive a re&s;emblance between her&s;elf and the picture Howell had drawn.&mdash;Lord Mortimer was unutterably affected by her tears, a faint &s;icki&s;hne&s;s &s;eized him, he &s;unk upon his &s;eat, and covered his face with his handkerchief, to hide his emotion; but by the time &s;ervice was over, it was pretty well di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ipated: Amanda returned home, and Lord Mor|timer waited for Howell's coming out of church. "What the devil Howell," &s;aid he, "did you mean by giving us &s;uch an exhortation? Have you di&s;covered any little affair going on between &s;ome of your ru&s;tic neighbours?" The par&s;on coloured, but remained &s;ilent; Lord Mortimer rallied him a little more, and then de|parted; but his gaiety was only a&s;&s;umed.</P>
<P>On his fir&s;t acquaintance with Amanda, in con&s;e|quence of what he heard from Mrs. Abergwilly, and
<PB N="73" REF="038416_0072_1011E1D33197C918">
ob&s;erved him&s;elf, he had been tempted to think &s;he was involved in my&s;tery; and what but impropriety, he thought, could occa&s;ion my&s;tery. To &s;ee &s;o young, &s;o lovely, &s;o elegant a creature, an inmate of a &s;eque&s;ter|ed cottage, a&s;&s;ociating with people (in manners at lea&s;t) &s;o infinitely beneath her; to &s;ee her trembling and blu&s;hing, if a word was dropt that &s;eemed tending to enquire into her motives for retirement; all the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances, I &s;ay, con&s;idered, naturally excited a &s;u&s;|picion injurious to her, in the mind of Lord Mortimer; and he was tempted to think &s;ome deviation from pru|dence had, by depriving her of the favor of her friends, made her retire to ob&s;curity; and that &s;he would not di&s;like an opportunity of emerging from it, he could not help thinking. In con&s;equence of the&s;e ideas, he could not think him&s;elf very culpable in encouraging the wi&s;hes her loveline&s;s gave ri&s;e to: be&s;ides he had &s;ome rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect &s;he de&s;ired to in&s;pire him with the&s;e wi&s;hes; for Mrs. Abergwilly told him &s;he had in|formed Mrs. Edwin of his arrival; an information he could not doubt her having immediately communicated to Amanda; therefore, her continuing to come to the Hall &s;eemed as if &s;he wi&s;hed to throw her&s;elf in his way. Mrs. Edwin had indeed been told of his arrival, but con|cealed it from Amanda, that &s;he &s;hould not be di&s;ap|pointed of going to the Hall, which &s;he knew if once informed of it, &s;he would not go to.</P>
<P>'Tis true, Lord Mortimer &s;aw Amanda wore, at lea&s;t, the &s;emblance of innocence; but this could not remove his &s;u&s;picions, &s;o often had he &s;een it a&s;&s;umed, to hide the artful &s;tratagems of a depraved heart.</P>
<P>Ah! why will the lovely female, adorned with all that heaven and earth can be&s;tow to render her amiable, o'erleap the mode&s;ty of nature, and by levity and bold|ne&s;s loo&s;e all preten&s;ions to the e&s;teem which would other|wi&s;e be her involuntary tribute.</P>
<P>Nor is it her&s;elf alone &s;he injures; &s;he hurts each child of purity, helps to point the &s;ting of ridicule, and weave the web of art.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="038416_0073_1011E1D4D17F37B0">
We &s;hun the blazing &s;un, but court his tempered beams; the ro&s;e which glares upon the day is never &s;o much &s;ought as the bud enwrapt in the foliage; and to u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion of a late much admired author, "the retiring graces have ever been reckoned the mo&s;t beau|tiful."</P>
<P>He had never heard the Earl mention a per&s;on of the name of Dunford: and he knew not, or rather &s;u&s;pect|ed, little credit was to be given to her a&s;&s;ertion of an intimacy between them, particularly as he &s;aw her, whenever the &s;ubject was mentioned, &s;hrinking from it in the greate&s;t confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Her re&s;erve he imputed to pretence; and flattering him&s;elf it would &s;oon wear off, determined for the pre|&s;ent at lea&s;t, to humor her affectation.</P>
<P>With &s;uch ideas, &s;uch &s;entiments, had Lord Morti|mer's fir&s;t vi&s;its to Amanda commenced: but they ex|perienced an immediate change, as the decrea&s;ing re|&s;erve of her manners gave him greater and more fre|quent opportunities of di&s;covering her mental perfec|tions: the &s;trength of her under&s;tanding, the ju&s;tne&s;s of her remarks, the liveline&s;s of her fancy, above all, the purity which mingled in every &s;entiment, and the mo|de&s;ty which accompanied every word, filled him with delight and amazement: his doubts gradually le&s;&s;ened, and at la&s;t vani&s;hed, and with them every de&s;ign, which they alone had ever given ri&s;e to. E&s;teem was now united to love, and real re&s;pect to admiration: in her &s;ociety he only was happy, and thought not, or rather would not &s;uffer him&s;elf to think, on the con&s;equence of &s;uch an attachment. It might be &s;aid he was entranced in plea&s;ure, from which Howell completely rou&s;ed him, and made him &s;eriou&s;ly a&s;k his heart, what were its intentions relative to Amanda. Of &s;uch views as he perceived Howell &s;u&s;pected him of harbouring, his con|&s;cience entirely acquitted him; yet &s;o great were the ob&s;tacles he knew in the way of an union between him and Amanda, that he almo&s;t regretted (as every one does who acts again&s;t their better judgment) that he had not fled at the fir&s;t intimation of his danger. So
<PB N="75" REF="038416_0074_1011E1D89FACF2A0">
truly formidable indeed did the&s;e ob&s;tacles appear, that he at times re&s;olved to break with Amanda, if he could fix upon any plan for doing &s;o, without injuring his honor, after the great attention he had paid her.</P>
<P>Ere he came to any final determination, however, he re&s;olved to try and di&s;cover her real &s;ituation: if he even left her, it would be a &s;atisfaction to his heart to know whether his friend&s;hip could be &s;erviceable: and if an oppo&s;ite mea&s;ure was his plan, it could never be put in execution, without the de&s;ired information. He accor|dingly wrote his &s;i&s;ter, Lady Araminta Dormer, who was then in the country with Lord Cherbury, to reque&s;t &s;he would inquire from his father, whether he knew a per&s;on of the name of Dunford; and if he did, what his &s;ituation and family were. Lord Mortimer begged her Lady&s;hip not to mention the inquiries being dictated by him, and promi&s;ed at &s;ome future period to explain the rea&s;on of them. He &s;till continued his a&s;&s;iduities to Amanda, and at the expected time received an an|&s;wer to his letter; but how was he &s;hocked and alarmed, when informed, Lord Cherbury never knew a per&s;on of the name of Dunford. His doubts began to revive; but before he yielded entirely to them, he re&s;olved to go to Amanda, and inquire from her, in the mo&s;t explicit terms, how, and at what time, her father and the Earl had become acquainted: determined, if &s;he an&s;wered him without embarra&s;&s;ment, to mention to his &s;i&s;ter whatever circum&s;tances &s;he related, le&s;t a forgetfulne&s;s of them had alone made the Earl deny his knowledge of Dunford. Ju&s;t as he was pa&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing the Grove with this intent, he e&s;pied Edwin and his wife coming down a cro&s;s-road from the village, where they had been with poultry and vegetables: it in&s;tantly occurred to him, that the&s;e people, in the &s;implicity of their hearts, might unfold the real &s;ituation of Amanda, and &s;ave him the painful nece&s;&s;ity of making enquiries, which &s;he perhaps would not an&s;wer, without his real motives for making them a&s;&s;igned, which was what he could not think of doing.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="038416_0075_1011E1DB6BE1AC50">
In&s;tead, therefore, of proceeding, he &s;topt till they came up to him, and then with the mo&s;t engaging affa|bility addre&s;&s;ed them, inquiring whether they had been &s;ucce&s;sful in the di&s;po&s;al of their goods; they an&s;wered bowing and curt&s;eying; and he then in&s;i&s;ted that, as they appeared tired, they &s;hould repair to the Hall, and re&s;t them&s;elves. This was too great an honor to be re|fu&s;ed; and they followed their noble conductor, who ha&s;tened forward, to order refre&s;hment into a parlour for them. The nur&s;e, who in her own way was a cun|ning woman, in&s;tantly &s;u&s;pected, from the great and uncommon attention of Lord Mortimer, that he want|ed to inquire into the &s;ituation of Amanda. As &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw him at &s;ome di&s;tance, "David," cried &s;he, "as &s;ure as eggs are eggs, (unpinning her white apron, and &s;moothing it nicely down as &s;he &s;poke) this young Lort wants to have our company, that he may find out &s;ome|thing apout Mi&s;s Amanda. Ah! ple&s;s her pretty face, I thought how it would be; but we mu&s;t be as cunning as foxes, and not tell too much or too little; becau&s;e if we told too much, it would offend her, and &s;he would a&s;k us how we got all our intelligence, and would not think us over and apove genteel, when &s;he heard we had &s;ifted Jemmy Hawthorn for it, when he came down from London with her. All we mu&s;t do is ju&s;t to drop &s;ome hints, as it were, of her &s;ituation, and then his Lort&s;hip, to be &s;ure, will make his advantage of them, and a&s;k her every thing apout her&s;elf, and then &s;he will tell him of her own accord: &s;o, David, mind what you &s;ay, I charge you." "Ay, ay," cried David, "leave me alone; I'll warrant you'll always find an old &s;oldier cute enough for any poty." When they reached the Hall, they were &s;hewn into a parlour, where Lord Mor|timer was expecting them; with difficulty he made them &s;it down at the table, where meat and wine were laid out for them: after they had partaken of them, Lord Mortimer began with a&s;king Edwin &s;ome que&s;tions about his farm, (for he was a tenant on the Tudor e&s;tate) and whether there was any thing wanting to render it more comfortable. No, Edwin replied with a low bow,
<PB N="77" REF="038416_0076_1011E1DFEA988E68">
thanking his honourable Lord&s;hip for his enquiry. Lord Mortimer &s;poke of his family. "Ay Cot ple&s;s the poor things," Edwin &s;aid, "they were to be &s;ure a fine thriving &s;et of chil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ren." Still Lord Mortimer had not touched on the &s;ubject neare&s;t his heart; he felt embar|ra&s;&s;ed and agitated: at la&s;t, with as much compo&s;ure as he could a&s;&s;ume, he a&s;ked, how long they imagined Mi&s;s. Dunford would &s;tay with them. Now was the nur&s;e's time to &s;peak: &s;he had hitherto &s;at &s;impering and bowing. "That depended on circum&s;tances," &s;he &s;aid. "Poor tear young laty, though their little cot|tage was &s;o ob&s;cure, and &s;o unlike any thing &s;he had before been accu&s;tomed to, &s;he made her&s;elf quite hap|py with it." "Her father mu&s;t mi&s;s her &s;ociety very much," exclaimed Lord Mortimer. "Tear heart, to be &s;ure he does," cried nur&s;e. "Well, &s;trange things happen every tay; but &s;till I never thought what did happen would have happened, to make the poor old gen|tleman and his daughter part." "What happened?" exclaimed lord Mortimer, &s;tarting, and &s;uddenly &s;top|ping in the middle of the room; for hitherto he had been walking backwards and forwards. 'Twas not her bu&s;ine&s;s, the nur&s;e replied, by no manner of means, to be &s;peaking apout the affairs of her petters; put for all that &s;he could not help &s;aying, becau&s;e &s;he thought it a pity his Lort&s;hip, who was &s;o good and &s;o affable, &s;hould re|main in ignorance of every thing; that Mi&s;s Amanda was not what &s;he appeared to be; no if the truth was told, not the per&s;on &s;he pa&s;&s;ed for at all; "but lort, &s;he would ne|ver forgive me," cried the nur&s;e, "if your Lord&s;hip told her, it was from me your Lort&s;hip heard this. Poor tear thing &s;he is very unwilling to have her &s;ituation known, though &s;he is not the fir&s;t poty who has met with a pad man; and &s;hame and &s;orrow be upon him, who ti&s;tre&s;t her&s;elf and her father.</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer had heard enough; every doubt, eve|ry &s;u&s;picion was realized; and he was equally unable and unwilling to enquire further. It was plain Amanda was unworthy of his e&s;teem; and to enquire into the cir|cum&s;tances
<PB N="78" REF="038416_0077_1011E1E262D3CD50">
which occa&s;ioned that unworthine&s;s, would only have tortured him. He rung the bell abruptly, and ordering Mrs. Abergwilly to attend the Edwins, with|drew immediately to another room. Now was there an opportunity for Lord Mortimer to break with Amanda, without the &s;malle&s;t imputation on his honour. Did it give him plea&s;ure? No: it filled him with &s;orrow, di&s;ap|pointment, and angui&s;h; the &s;oftne&s;s of her manners, even more than the beauty of her per&s;on, had fa&s;cinated his &s;oul, and made him determine, if he found her wor|thy, (of which indeed he had then but little doubt) to cea&s;e not, till every ob&s;tacle which could impede their union &s;hould be overcome. He was in&s;pired with indig|nation at the idea of the &s;nare he imagined &s;he had laid for him; thinking her mode&s;ty all a pretext for drawing him into making honourable propo&s;als. As &s;he &s;unk in his e&s;teem, her charms le&s;&s;ened in his fancy; and he thought it would be a proper puni&s;hment for her, and a noble triumph over him&s;elf, if he conquered, or at lea&s;t re&s;i&s;ted his pa&s;&s;ion, and for&s;ook her entirely. Full of this idea, and influenced by re&s;entment for her &s;up|po&s;ed deceit, he re&s;olved without longer delay, to fulfil the purpo&s;e which brought him into Wales, namely, vi&s;iting his friend; but how frail is re&s;olution and re&s;ent|ment, when oppo&s;ed by tenderne&s;s: without &s;uffering him&s;elf to believe there was the lea&s;t abatement of ei|ther in his mind, he forbid the carriage, in a few mi|nutes after he had ordered it, merely, he per&s;uaded him|&s;elf, for the purpo&s;e of yet more &s;everely mortifying A|manda; as his continuing a little longer in the neigh|bourhood, without noticing her, might, perhaps, con|vince her, &s;he was not quite &s;o fa&s;cinating as &s;he be|lieved her&s;elf to be. From the time his re&s;idence at Tu|dor-Hall was known, he had received con&s;tant invitations from the &s;urrounding families, (which on Amanda's account) he uniformly declined; this he re&s;olved &s;hould no longer be the ca&s;e: &s;ome were yet unan&s;wered, and the&s;e he meant to accept, as means indeed of keeping him &s;teady in his re&s;olution of not &s;eeing her, and bani&s;hing her, in &s;ome degree, from his thoughts.
<PB N="79" REF="038416_0078_1011E1E3F2F06BA8">
But he could not have fixed on a wor&s;e method than the&s;e, for affecting either of his purpo&s;es: the &s;ociety he now mixed among, was &s;o different from that he had lately been accu&s;tomed to, that he was continually em|ployed in drawing compari&s;ons between them; he grew re&s;tle&s;s; his unhappine&s;s increa&s;ed: and he at la&s;t felt, that if he de&s;ired to experience any comfort, he mu&s;t no longer ab&s;ent him&s;elf from Amanda; and al&s;o that, if &s;he refu&s;ed to accede to the only propo&s;als now in his power to make her, he would be mi&s;erable; &s;o e&s;&s;ential did he deem her &s;ociety to his happine&s;s; &s;o much was he attached from the &s;oftne&s;s and &s;weetne&s;s of her man|ners. At the time he finally determined to &s;ee her again, he was in a large party at a Welch Baronet's, where he had dined; and on the rack of impatience to put his de|termination in practice, he retired early, and took the road to the cottage.</P>
<P>Poor Amanda, during this time, was a prey to di&s;|quiet: The fir&s;t day of Lord Mortimer's ab&s;ence, &s;he felt a little unea&s;ine&s;s, but &s;trove to di&s;&s;ipate it, by thinking bu&s;ine&s;s had detained him. The next morn|ing &s;he remained entirely at home, every moment ex|pecting to behold him; but this expectation was totally de&s;troyed, when from the out&s;ide room &s;he heard one of the nur&s;e's &s;ons tell of all the company he met going to Sir Lewis ap Shenkin's, and among&s;t the re&s;t Lord Mor|timer, who&s;e &s;ervants had told him, the day before their Lord dined at Mr. Jones's, where there was a deal of company, and a great ball in the evening. Amanda's heart almo&s;t died within her at the&s;e words; plea&s;ure then, not bu&s;ine&s;s, had prevented Lord Mortimer from coming to her, the&s;e amu&s;ements, which he had &s;o often declared were ta&s;tele&s;s to him, from the &s;uperior de|light he experienced in her &s;ociety. Either he was in|&s;incere in &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions, or had now grown indifferent. She condemned her&s;elf for ever having permitted his vi&s;its, or received his a&s;&s;iduities; &s;he reproached him for ever having paid tho&s;e a&s;&s;iduities, knowing, as he mu&s;t, the in&s;incerity or incon&s;tancy of his nature. In &s;pite of wounded pride, tears of &s;orrow and di&s;appoint|ment

bur&s;t from her; and her only con&s;olation was, that no one ob&s;erved her. Her hours pa&s;&s;ed away heavily; &s;he could not attend to any thing, and in the evening walked out, to indulge in a lonely ramble, the dejection of her heart; &s;he turned from Tudor-Hall, and to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">k, (without knowing it indeed) the very road which led to the hou&s;e where Lord Mortimer had dined. With &s;low and pen&s;ive &s;teps &s;he pur&s;ued her way, regardle&s;s of all around her, till an approaching foot&s;tep made her rai&s;e her eyes, and &s;he beheld with equal &s;urpri&s;e and confu&s;ion, the very object who was then employing her thoughts. Obeying the impul&s;e of pride, &s;he ha&s;tily turned away, till recollecting, that her precipitately avoiding him would at once betray her &s;entiments, &s;he pau&s;ed to li&s;ten to his pa&s;&s;ionate inquiries after her health; having an&s;wered them with involuntary cold|ne&s;s &s;he again moved on; but her progre&s;s was &s;oon &s;topt by Lord Mortimer; &s;natching her hand, he in&s;i&s;t|ed on knowing, why &s;he appeared &s;o de&s;irous to avoid him. Amanda made no reply to this, but de&s;ired he would let her go. "Never," he exclaimed, "till you wear another face to me. Oh! did you know the pain I have &s;uffered &s;ince la&s;t we met, you would from pity, I am &s;ure, treat me with le&s;s coldne&s;s." Amanda's heart throbbed with &s;udden plea&s;ure; but &s;he &s;oon &s;ilenced its emotion, by reflecting, that a declaration of unea&s;ine&s;s, at the very time he was entering into gaiety, had &s;omething too incon&s;i&s;tent in it, to merit credit. Hurt by &s;uppo&s;ing he wanted to impo&s;e on her, &s;he made yet more violent efforts to di&s;engage her hand; but Lord Mortimer held it too firmly for her to be &s;uc|ce&s;sful; he &s;aw &s;he was offended, and it gave him flat|tering ideas of the e&s;timation in which he &s;tood with her, &s;ince to re&s;ent his neglect, was the mo&s;t convinc|ing proof he could receive of the value &s;he &s;et upon his attention. Without hurting her feelings by a hint, that he believed the alteration in her manner occa&s;ion|ed by his ab&s;ence, in indirect terms he apologized for it, &s;aying what indeed was partly true, that a letter lately received had &s;o ruffled his mind, he was quite unfit for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ociety, and had therefore availed him&s;elf of tho&s;e
<PB N="81" REF="038416_0080_1011E1E7F6718000">
hours of chagrin and unea&s;ine&s;s to accept invitations, which at &s;ome time or other he mu&s;t have done, to avoid giving offence and by acting as he had done, he re&s;erved the precious moments of returning tranquility for her he adored. Ah! how readily do we receive any apology, do we admit of any excu&s;e, that comes from a beloved object. Amanda felt as if a weight was &s;ud|denly removed from her heart: her eyes were no longer bent to the earth, her cheek no longer pale; and a &s;mile, the &s;mile of innocence, and love, enlivened all her fea|tures. She &s;eemed &s;uddenly to forget her hand was detained by Lord Mortimer, for no longer did &s;he at|tempt to free it; &s;he &s;uffered him gently to draw it within his, and lead her to the favourite haunt in Tudor Grove.</P>
<P>Plea&s;ed, yet blu&s;hing and confu&s;ed, &s;he heard Lord Mortimer with more energy, than he had ever yet ex|pre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with, declare the pain he &s;uffered the days he &s;aw her not. From his ardent, his pa&s;&s;ionate expre&s;&s;ions, what could the innocent Amanda infer, but that he intended, by uniting his de&s;tiny to her's, to &s;ecure to him&s;elf a &s;ociety he &s;o highly valued; what could &s;he infer, but that he meant immediately to &s;peak in explicit terms? The idea was too plea&s;ing to be received in tranquility, and her whole &s;oul felt agitated. While they pur&s;ued their way through Tudor Grove the &s;ky, which had been lowering the whole day, became &s;uddenly more darkened, and by its increa&s;ing gloom foretold an approaching &s;torm. Lord Mortimer no longer oppo&s;ed Amanda's returning home; but &s;carcely had they turned for that purpo&s;e, ere the vivid light|ning fla&s;hed acro&s;s their path, and the thunder was awful|ly reverberated among&s;t the hills. The Hall was much nearer than the cottage, and Lord Mortimer, throwing his arms around Amanda's wai&s;t, hurried her to it; but ere they reached the library, who&s;e door was the fir&s;t they came to, the rain began pouring with violence. Lord Mortimer &s;natched off Amanda's wet hat and cloak, the re&s;t of her cloathes were quite dry; and im|mediately ordered tea and coffee, as &s;he refu&s;ed any other refre&s;hments: he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the attendants, that he
<PB N="82" REF="038416_0081_1011E1E990DF9C50">
might, without ob&s;ervation or re&s;traint, enjoy her &s;ociety. As &s;he pre&s;ided at the tea-table, his eyes, with the fonde&s;t rapture, were fa&s;tened on her face, which never had ap|peared more lovely: exerci&s;e had heightened the pale tint of her cheek, o'er which her glo&s;&s;y hair curled in beautiful di&s;order; the unu&s;ual glow gave a greater ra|diance to her eyes, who&s;e &s;oft confu&s;ion denoted the plea&s;ure &s;he experienced from the attentions of Lord Mortimer. He re&s;trained not, he could not re&s;train, the feelings of his &s;oul. "Oh what happine&s;s," he ex|claimed. "No wonder I found all &s;ociety ta&s;tele&s;s, after having experienced your's. Where could I find &s;uch &s;oftne&s;s, yet &s;uch &s;en&s;ibility; &s;uch &s;weetne&s;s, yet &s;uch animation; &s;uch beauty, yet &s;uch apparent uncon&s;cious|ne&s;s of it. Oh my Amanda, &s;moothly mu&s;t that life g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ide on, who&s;e de&s;tiny you &s;hall &s;hare." Amanda en|deavoured to check the&s;e tran&s;ports, yet &s;ecretly they filled her with delight, for &s;he regarded them as the &s;in|cere effu&s;ions of honourable love. Pre&s;ent happine&s;s, however, could not render her forgetful of propriety: by the time tea was over, the evening began to clear, and &s;he prote&s;ted &s;he mu&s;t depart; Lord Mortimer prote&s;ted again&s;t this for &s;ome time longer, and at la&s;t brought her to the window, to convince her there was &s;till a &s;light rain falling. He promi&s;ed to &s;ee her home as &s;oon as it was over, and entreated in the mean time, &s;he would gratify him with a &s;ong. Amanda did not refu&s;e; but the raptures he expre&s;&s;ed while &s;inging, &s;he thought too violent, and ro&s;e from the piano when &s;he had concluded in &s;pite of his entreaties on the con|trary. She in&s;i&s;ted on getting her hat and cloak, which had been &s;ent to Mrs. Abergwilly to dry; Lord Mor|timer at la&s;t reluctantly went out to obey her.</P>
<P>Amanda walked to the window: the pro&s;pect from it was lovely: the evening was now perfectly &s;erene, a few light clouds alone floated in the &s;ky, their lucid &s;kirts tinged with purple rays from the declining &s;un; the trees wore a brighter green, and the dew-drop that had heightened their verdure, yet glittered on their &s;prays; acro&s;s a di&s;tant valley was extended a beautiful
<PB N="83" REF="038416_0082_1011E1EF476E3CA8">
rainbow, the &s;acred record of heaven's covenant with man. All nature appeared revived and animated; the birds now warbled their clo&s;ing lays, and the bleating of the cattle was heard from the neighbouring hills. "Oh! how &s;weet, how lovely is the dewy land-&s;cape," exclaimed Amanda, with that delight, which &s;cenes of calm and vernal nature never fail of rai&s;ing in minds of piety and tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>"'Tis lovely indeed," repeated Lord Mortimer, who returned at the moment, a&s;&s;uring her the things would be &s;ent in directly. "I admire the pro&s;pect," continued he, "becau&s;e you gaze upon it with me: were you ab&s;ent, like every other charm, it would lo&s;e its beauty, and become ta&s;tele&s;s to me. Tell me," cried he, gently encircling her wai&s;t, "why this hurry, why this wi&s;h to leave me? Do you expect el&s;ewhere to meet with a being, who will value your &s;ociety more highly than I do? Do you expect to meet with a heart, more fondly, more firmly attached to you, than mine? Oh my Aman|da, if you do, how mi&s;taken are &s;uch expectations!"</P>
<P>Amanda blu&s;hed, and averted her head, unable to &s;peak.</P>
<P>"Ah why," continued he, pur&s;uing her averted eyes with his, "&s;hould we create unea&s;ine&s;s to our&s;elves, by again &s;eparating?"</P>
<P>Amanda looked up at the&s;e words, with involuntary &s;urpri&s;e in her countenance. Lord Mortimer under|&s;tood it: he &s;aw &s;he had hitherto deluded her&s;elf with thinking, his intentions towards her very different from what they really were: to &s;uffer her longer to deceive her&s;elf, would he thought, be cruelty. Straining her to his beating heart, he imprinted a ki&s;s on her tremu|lous lips, and &s;oftly told her, that the life which with|out her would lo&s;e half its charms, &s;hould be devoted to her &s;ervice; and that his fortune like his heart, &s;hould be in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Trembling while &s;he &s;truggled to free her&s;elf from his arms, Amanda demanded what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e meant: her manner &s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed and confu&s;ed him; but recollecting that this was the moment for expla|nation, he, though with half-averted eyes, declared his
<PB N="84" REF="038416_0083_1011E1F0D7D75138">
hopes&mdash;his wi&s;hes and intentions. Surpri&s;e,&mdash;horror,&mdash;and indignation, for a few minutes overpowered Aman|da; but &s;uddenly recovering her &s;cattered &s;en&s;es, with a &s;trength greater than &s;he had ever before felt, &s;he bur&s;t from him, and attempted to ru&s;h from the room. Lord Mortimer caught hold of her: "whither are you going, Amanda?" exclaimed he, affrighted by her manner.</P>
<P>"From the ba&s;e&s;t of men," cried &s;he, &s;truggling to di&s;engage her&s;elf.</P>
<P>He &s;hut the door, and forced her back to a chair: he was &s;hocked&mdash;amazed&mdash;and confounded by her looks; no art could have a&s;&s;umed &s;uch a &s;emblance of &s;orrow as &s;he now wore; no feelings, but tho&s;e of the mo&s;t de|licate nature, have expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch emotion as &s;he now betrayed; the enlivening bloom of her cheeks were fled, and &s;ucceeded by a deadly palene&s;s; and her &s;oft eyes, robbed of their lu&s;tre, were bent to the ground with the deepe&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of woe. Lord Mortimer began to think he had mi&s;taken, if not her character, her di&s;|po&s;ition; and the idea of having in&s;ulted either purity or penitence, was like a dagger to his heart. "Oh my love!" he exclaimed, laying his hand on her trembling one, "what do you mean by departing &s;o abruptly?"</P>
<P>"My meaning, my Lord," cried &s;he, ri&s;ing, and &s;ha|king his hand from her's, "is now as obvious as your own&mdash;I &s;eek, forever, to quit a man who, under the ap|pearance of delicate attention, meditated &s;o ba&s;e a &s;cheme again&s;t me. My credulity may have yielded you amu&s;ement, but it has afforded you no triumph: the tenderne&s;s which I know you think, which I &s;hall not deny your having in&s;pired me with, as it was excited by imaginary virtues, &s;o it vani&s;hed with the illu&s;ion which gave it birth; what then was innocent, would now be guilty. Oh heavens!" continued Amanda, cla&s;ping her hands together, in a &s;udden agony of tears, "is it me, the helple&s;s child of &s;orrow, Lord Mortimer &s;ought as a victim to illicit love! Is it the &s;on of Lord Cherbury, de&s;tined &s;uch a blow again&s;t the unfortunate Fitzalan!"</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer &s;tarted. "Fitzalan!" repeated he.
<PB N="85" REF="038416_0084_1011E1F38EE88740">
"Oh! Amanda, why did you conceal your real name? and what am I to infer from your having done &s;o?"</P>
<P>"What you plea&s;e, my Lord," cried &s;he, "The opi|nion of a per&s;on I de&s;pi&s;e can be of little con&s;equence to me. Yet," continued &s;he, as if &s;uddenly recollecting her&s;elf, "that you may have no plea for extenuating your conduct, know, that my name was concealed by the de|&s;ire of my father, who, involved in unexpected di&s;tre&s;s, wi&s;hed me to adopt another, till his affairs were &s;ettled."</P>
<P>"This concealment has undone me," exclaimed Lord Mortimer: "it has led me into an error, I &s;hall never cea&s;e repenting. Oh! Amanda, deign to li&s;ten to the circum&s;tances which occa&s;ioned this error, and you will then, I am &s;ure, think me at lea&s;t le&s;s culpable than I now appear to be; you will then, perhaps, allow me to make &s;ome atonement."</P>
<P>"No, my Lord," cried Amanda, "willingly I will not allow my&s;elf to be deceived: for without deceit, I am convinced you could mention no circum&s;tance, which could po&s;&s;ibly palliate your conduct, or what you &s;o gently term an error."</P>
<P>"Had I, my Lord, by art or coquetry, &s;ought to at|tract your notice, your crime would have been pallia|ted; but when you pur&s;ued, I retired: and the know|ledge of your being Lord Cherbury's &s;on, fir&s;t induced me to receive your vi&s;its. I &s;uffered their continuance, becau&s;e I thought you amiable: &s;ad mi&s;take! Oh! cruel, ungenerous Mortimer, how have you abu&s;ed my un|&s;u&s;pecting confidence!"</P>
<P>As &s;he ended the&s;e words, &s;he moved towards the door. Awed by her manner, confounded by her re|proaches, tortured by remor&s;e, and half offended at her refu&s;ing to hear his vindication, he no longer attempt|ed to prevent her quitting the apartment: he followed her, however, from it. "What do you mean, my Lord," a&s;ked &s;he, "by coming after me?"</P>
<P>"I mean to &s;ee you &s;afely home," replied he, in a tone of proud &s;ullenne&s;s.</P>
<P>"And is it Lord Mortimer," cried &s;he, looking &s;ted|fa&s;tly in his face, "pretends to &s;ee me &s;afe?"</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="038416_0085_1011E1F5D62455C0">
He &s;tampt, &s;truck his hand violently again&s;t his fore|head, and exclaimed, "I &s;ee&mdash;I &s;ee&mdash;I am de&s;picable in your eyes; but, Amanda, I cannot endure your re|proaches. Pau&s;e for a few minutes, and you will find I am not &s;o de&s;erving of them as you imagine."</P>
<P>She made no reply, but quickened her pace: within a few yards of the cottage Lord Mortimer caught her with a di&s;tracted air. "Amanda," &s;aid he, "I cannot bear to part with you in this manner: you think me the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">erie&s;t villain on earth; you will drive me from your heart; I &s;hall become abhorrent to you."</P>
<P>"Mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly, my Lord," replied &s;he in a &s;olemn voice.</P>
<P>"Cannot compunction then extenuate my error?"</P>
<P>"'Tis not compunction, 'tis regret you feel, for find|ing your de&s;igns un&s;ucce&s;sful."</P>
<P>"No: by all that is &s;acred, 'tis remor&s;e for ever hav|ing meditated &s;uch an injury. Yet I again repeat, if you li&s;ten to me, you will find I am not &s;o culpable as you believe. Oh! let me be&s;eech you to do &s;o; let me hope, that my life may be devoted to you alone, and that I may thus have opportunities of apologizing for my conduct. Oh! deare&s;t Amanda," kneeling before her "drive me not from you in the hour of penitence."</P>
<P>"You plead in vain, my Lord," cried &s;he breaking from him.</P>
<P>He &s;tarted in an agony from the ground, and again &s;eized her. "Is it thus," he exclaimed, "with &s;uch unfeeling coldne&s;s I am abandoned by Amanda? I will leave you, if you only &s;ay I am not dete&s;ted by you; if you only &s;ay, the remembrance of the &s;weet hours we have &s;pent together will not become hateful to you."</P>
<P>He was pale, and trembled; a tear wet his cheek. Amanda's began to flow: &s;he averted her head, to hide her emotion; but he had perceived it. "You weep, my Amanda." &s;aid he, "and you feel the influence of pity!"</P>
<P>"No, no," cried &s;he, in a tone &s;carcely articulate.</P>
<P>"I will acknowledge," continued &s;he, "I believe you po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;en&s;ibility; and an anticipation of the pain|ful feelings it will excite on the reflection of your con|duct

to me, now &s;tops my further reproaches. Ah! my Lord, timely profit by mental correction, nor ever again encourage a pa&s;&s;ion, which virtue cannot &s;anction, or rea&s;on ju&s;tify.</P>

<P>Amanda darted from Lord Mortimer; and entering the cottage, ha&s;tily clo&s;ed the door. Her looks terri|fied the nur&s;e, who was the only one of the family up, and who, by means of one of her &s;ons, had di&s;covered that Amanda had taken refuge from the thunder &s;torm in Tudor Hall.</P>
<P>Amanda had neither hat or cloak on; her face was pale as death: her hair, blown by the wind, and wet from the rai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, hung di&s;hevelled about her; and to the inquiries of the nur&s;e &s;he could only an&s;wer by &s;obs and tears. "Lack a tay," &s;aid the nur&s;e, "what ails my &s;weet chilt?"</P>
<P>Relieved by tears, Amanda told her nur&s;e &s;he was not very well, and that &s;he had been reflecting on the great impropriety there was in receiving Lord Mortimer's vi|&s;its, whom &s;he begged her nur&s;e (if he came again) not to admit.</P>
<P>The nur&s;e &s;hook her head, and &s;aid &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed there had been &s;ome quarrel between them; but if Lord Mortimer had done any thing to vex her tear chilt, &s;he would make him pay for it. Amanda charged her ne|ver to addre&s;s him on &s;uch a &s;ubject, and having made her promi&s;e not to admit him, &s;he retired to her cham|ber faint, weary and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. The indignity offered her by Colonel Belgrave had in&s;ulted her purity, and of|fended her pride, but it had not wounded the &s;ofter feel|ing&punc; of her &s;oul; it was Mortimer alone had power to work them up to agony.</P>
<P>The charm which had &s;oothed her &s;orrows was fled; and while &s;he glowed with keen re&s;entment, &s;he wept from di&s;appointed tenderne&s;s. "Alas! my father," &s;he cried, "is this the &s;ecure retreat you fondly thought you
<PB N="88" REF="038416_0087_1011E1FA52A55890">
had di&s;covered for me. Sad mi&s;take! le&s;s had I to dread from the audacious front of vice than the in&s;idious form of virtue: delicacy &s;hrinking from one, immedi|ately announced the danger; but innocence in&s;pired confidence in the other; and credulity, in&s;tead of &s;u&s;pi|cion, occupied the mind. Am I doomed to be the vic|tim of deception? and except thy hone&s;t, tender heart, my father, find every other fraught with deceit and treachery to me? Alas! if in the early &s;ea&s;on of youth perpetual perfidy makes us relinqui&s;h candor and hope, what charms can the world retain? The &s;oul &s;ickening recoils within it&s;elf, and no longer &s;tartles at di&s;&s;olution. Belgrave aimed at my peace&mdash;but Mortimer alone had power to pierce the "vital vulnerable heart." Oh! Mortimer, from you alone the blow is &s;evere&mdash;you, who, in divine language I may &s;ay, wert my guide, my com|panion, and my familiar friend.</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer was now a prey to all the pangs which an ingenuous mind, oppre&s;&s;ed with a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of error, mu&s;t ever feel: the mo&s;t implacable vengeance could not devi&s;e a greater puni&s;hment for him, than his own thoughts inflicted; the empire of inordinate pa&s;&s;ion was o'erthrown, and honor and rea&s;on regained their full and natural a&s;cendency over him. When he re|flected on the uniform appearance of innocence Amanda had always worn, he wondered at his weakne&s;s in ever having doubted its reality&mdash;at his audacity, in ever hav|ing in&s;ulted it; when he reflected on her melancholy, he &s;huddered as if having aggravated it.</P>
<P>"Your &s;orrows, as well as purity, my Amanda," he cried, "&s;hould have rendered you a &s;acred object to me."</P>
<P>A ray of con&s;olation darted into his mind, at the idea of prevailing on her to li&s;ten to the circum&s;tances which had led him into a conduct &s;o unworthy of her and him|&s;elf: &s;uch an explanation, he tru&s;ted, would regain her love and confidence, and make her accept, what he meant immediately to offer&mdash;his hand: for pride and ambition could rai&s;e no ob&s;tacle to oppo&s;e this de&s;ign of reparation; his happine&s;s depended on its being ac|cepted.
<PB N="89" REF="038416_0088_1011E1FC8E0C7750">
Amanda was dearer to him than life, and hope could &s;ketch no pro&s;pect, in which &s;he was not the fore|mo&s;t object. Impetuous in his pa&s;&s;ions, the lap&s;e of the hours was in&s;upportably tedious; and the idea of waiting till the morning to declare his penitence, his in|tention, and again implore her forgivene&s;s, filled him with agony: he went up to the cottage, and laid his hand upon the latch; he he&s;itated; even from the ru&s;tics he wi&s;hed to conceal his &s;hame and confu&s;ion. All within and without the cottage was &s;till; the moon|beams &s;eemed to &s;leep upon the thatch, and the trees were unagitated by a breeze.</P>
<P>"Happy ru&s;tics," exclaimed Lord Mortimer. "Chil|dren of content and undeviating integrity, &s;leep pre&s;&s;es &s;weetly on your eye-lids. My Amanda too re&s;ts, for &s;he is innocent."&mdash;He de&s;cended to the valley, and &s;aw a light from her window; he advanced within a few yards of it, and &s;aw her plainly walk about with an agi|tated air&mdash;her handkerchief rai&s;ed to her eyes, as if &s;he wept. His feelings ro&s;e almo&s;t to frenzy at this &s;ight, and he execrated him&s;elf for being the occa&s;ion of her tears. The village clock &s;truck one: Good heavens, how many hours mu&s;t intervene, ere he could kneel be|fore the lovely mourner, implore her &s;oft voice to accord his pardon, and (as he flattered him&s;elf would be the ca&s;e) in the fulne&s;s of reconciliation, pre&s;s her to his throbbing heart, as the &s;weet partner of his future days. The light was at la&s;t extingui&s;hed; but he could not re&s;t, and continued to wander about like a perturbed &s;pi|rit, till the day began to dawn, and he &s;aw &s;ome early pea&s;ants coming to their labours.</P>

<P>THE moment he thought he could &s;ee Amanda, Mortimer ha&s;tened to the cottage: the nur&s;e, as &s;he had promi&s;ed, would not reproach him, though &s;he &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected his having done &s;omething to of|fend her child: but her &s;ullen air declared her di&s;&s;atis|faction. "Mi&s;s Fitzalan was too ill," &s;he &s;aid, "to &s;ee company:" (for Lord Mortimer had enquired for Amanda by her real name, dete&s;ting the one of Dun|ford, to which, in a great degree, he imputed his unfor|tunate conduct to her.) The nur&s;e &s;poke truth in &s;aying Amanda was ill; her agitation was too much for her frame, and in the morning &s;he felt &s;o feveri&s;h, &s;he would not ri&s;e; &s;he had not &s;pirits, indeed, to attempt it. Sunk to the lowe&s;t ebb of dejection, &s;he felt &s;olitude alone congenial to her feelings. Hitherto the morning had been impatiently expected; for with Mortimer &s;he enjoyed its
<Q><L>"Cool, its fragrant, and its &s;ilent hour."</L></Q></P>
<P>But no Mortimer was now de&s;ired. In the evening he made another attempt; and finding Ellen alone, &s;ent in a &s;upplicatory me&s;&s;age by her to Amanda. She was ju&s;t ri&s;en, and Mrs. Edwin was making tea for her: a flu&s;h of indignation over&s;pread her pale face, on receiving his me&s;&s;age. "Tell him," &s;aid &s;he, "I am a&s;toni&s;hed at his reque&s;t, and never will grant it. Let him &s;eek el&s;e|where a heart more like his own, and trouble my repo&s;e no more."</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="038416_0090_1011E201A9D29AA0">
He heard her words, and in a fit of pa&s;&s;ion and di&s;|appointment flew out of the hou&s;e. Howell entered &s;oon after, and heard from Ellen an account of the quarrel: a &s;ecret hope &s;prung in his heart at this intelli|gence, and he de&s;ired Ellen to meet him in about half an hour in the valley, thinking by that time he could dictate &s;ome me&s;&s;age to &s;end by her to Amanda.</P>
<P>As the par&s;on had never paid Mi&s;s Fitzalan any of tho&s;e attentions which &s;trike a vulgar eye, and had often laughed and familiarly chatted with Ellen, &s;he took into her head he was an admirer of her's; and if being the object of Chip's admiration excited the envy of her neighbours, how much would that increa&s;e, when the par&s;on's predilection was known. She &s;et about adorn|ing her&s;elf for her appointment; and while thus em|ployed, the hone&s;t, faithful Chip entered, attired in his holiday cloaths to e&s;cort her to a little dance. Ellen bridled up at the fir&s;t intimation of it; and delighted with the me&s;&s;age Amanda had &s;ent to Lord Mortimer, which in her opinion was extremely eloquent, &s;he re|&s;olved now to imitate it.</P>
<P>"Timothy," &s;aid &s;he, drawing back her head, "your reque&s;t is the mo&s;t impropere&s;t that can be conceived, and it is by no means convenient for me to adhere to it. I tell you, Tim," cried &s;he, waving the corner of her white apron, for white handkerchief &s;he had not, "I wonder at your pre&s;umptione&s;s in making it&mdash;cea&s;e your flattering expre&s;&s;ions of love&mdash;look out among&s;t the in|feriority for a heart more like your own&mdash;and trouble my plea&s;ure no more."</P>
<P>Chip pau&s;ed for a moment, as if wanting to compre|hend her meaning. "The &s;hort and the long of it then, Nell," &s;aid he, "is, that you and I are to have nothing more to &s;ay to each other.</P>
<P>"True" cried his coque<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;h mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>"Well, well, Nell," &s;aid he half crying, "the time may come, when you will repent ever having &s;erved a true hearted lad in this manner." So &s;aying, he ran from the hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="038416_0091_1011CFAD159ABF18">
Ellen &s;urveyed her&s;elf with great admiration, and expected nothing le&s;s than an immediate offer of the par&s;on's hand. She found him punctual to his appoint|ment, and after walking &s;ometime about the valley, they &s;at down together upon a little bank. "Ellen," &s;aid he, taking her hand, "do you think there is any hope for me?"</P>
<P>"Nay now, intead, Mr. Howell," cried &s;he, with affected coyne&s;s, "that is &s;uch a &s;trange que&s;tion."</P>
<P>"But the quarrel, perhaps," &s;aid he, "may be made up."</P>
<P>"No, I a&s;&s;ure you," replied &s;he, with quickne&s;s, "it was entirely on your account it ever took place."</P>
<P>"Is it po&s;&s;ible," exclaimed he, plea&s;ure &s;parkling in his eyes, "then I may re-urge my pa&s;&s;ion."</P>
<P>"Ah, tear now, Mr. Howell, you are &s;o very pre&s;&s;ing."</P>
<P>"Do you think," a&s;ked he, "&s;he is too ill to &s;ee me?"</P>
<P>"Who too ill?"</P>
<P>"Why, Mi&s;s Fitzalan." (For the moment Ellen knew Lord Mortimer acquainted with Amanda's name, &s;he thought there was no longer rea&s;on for concealing it from any one, and had informed Howell of it.)</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Fitzalan! repeated &s;he, &s;taring and chang|ing colour.</P>
<P>"Yes, Ellen, the dear, lovely Mi&s;s Fitzalan, whom I adore more than language can expre&s;s, or imagination conceive."</P>
<P>Adieu to Ellen's airy hopes; her chagrin could not be concealed, and tears bur&s;t from her. The curate tenderly enquired the cau&s;e of her emotion: though vain &s;he was not artful, and could not di&s;gui&s;e it.&mdash;"Why really you made &s;uch &s;peeches, I thought&mdash;and then you looked &s;o. But it is no matter: I pelieve all men are teceitful."</P>
<P>From her tears and disjointed &s;entences, he began to &s;u&s;pect &s;omething, and his gentle mind was hurt at the idea of giving her pain; anxious however to receive his doom from Amanda, he again a&s;ked if &s;he thought he could &s;ee her. Ellen an&s;wered him &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">appi&s;hly, &s;he could

not tell: and hurried to the cottage, where a flood of tears &s;oon relieved her di&s;tre&s;s. To be dre&s;&s;ed &s;o charm|ingly, and for no purpo&s;e was a pity: &s;he therefore re|&s;olved on going to the dance, con&s;oling her&s;elf with the old &s;aying of having more than one &s;tring to her bow; and that if Chip was not as genteel, he was quite as per&s;onable a man as the curate. Walking down the lane &s;he met a little boy, who gave her a letter from Chip: full of the idea of its containing &s;ome overtures for a reconciliation, &s;he ha&s;tily broke it open, and read to the following effect:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>ELLEN, after your cruelty I could not bear to &s;tay in the village, as I never could work another &s;troke with a light heart; and every tree and meadow would remind me of the love my dear girl once bore her poor Chip. So before this comes to hand, I &s;hall be on my way to enter one of the king's &s;hips, and heaven knows whether we &s;hall ever meet again: but this I know, I &s;hall always love Ellen, though &s;he was &s;o cruel to her own faithful</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>TIM CHIP.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Thus did the vanity of Ellen receive a &s;peedy puni&s;h|ment. Her di&s;tre&s;s for &s;ome days was unabated, but at la&s;t yielded to the mild arguments of Amanda, and the hopes &s;he in&s;pired of &s;eeing the wandering hero again.</P>
<P>Howell at la&s;t obtained an interview, and ventured to plead his pa&s;&s;ion. Amanda thanked him for his regard, but declared her inability of returning it as he wi&s;hed; a&s;&s;uring him however, at the &s;ame time of her &s;incere friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>"This then &s;hall &s;uffice," &s;aid he. "Neither &s;orrow or di&s;appointment are new to me; and when they oppre&s;s me, I will turn to the idea of my angel friend, and forget (for &s;ome moments at lea&s;t) my heavy burthen."</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer made &s;everal attempts for again &s;eeing Amanda but without &s;ucce&s;s: he then wrote, but his letters were not more &s;ucce&s;sful. In de&s;pair at finding neither letters nor me&s;&s;ages received by Amanda, he, at la&s;t, by &s;tratagem, effected an interview: meeting one
<PB N="94" REF="038416_0093_1011E205A789CF98">
of the young Edwins returning from the po&s;t-town with a letter, he inquired, and heard it was for Mi&s;s Fitzalan; a little per&s;ua&s;ion prevailed on the young man to relin|qui&s;h it, and Lord Mortimer flew directly to the cottage. "Now," cried he, "the inexorable girl mu&s;t appear, if &s;he wi&s;hes to receive her letter." The nur&s;e informed. Amanda of it; but &s;he &s;u&s;pecting it to be a &s;cheme, re|fu&s;ed to appear. "By heaven, I do not deceive her," exclaimed Lord Mortimer, "nor will I give the letter into any hand but her's.</P>
<P>"This, my Lord," &s;aid Amanda, coming from her chamber, "is really cruel; but give me the letter," im|patiently &s;tretching out her hand for it.</P>
<P>"Another-condition remains to be complied with," cried he, &s;eizing her &s;oft hand, which &s;he, however, in|&s;tantly withdrew. "You mu&s;t read it, Mi&s;s Fitzalan, in my pre&s;ence."</P>
<P>"Good heavens how you torment me!" &s;he ex|claimed.</P>
<P>"Do you comply, then?"</P>
<P>"Yes," &s;he replied, and received the letter from him.</P>
<P>The pity and compunction of his Lord&s;hip increa&s;ed, as he gazed on her pale face, while her eyes eagerly ran over the contents of the letter, which was as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>To Mi&s;s Fitzalan.</HEAD>
<P>TO be able to communicate plea&s;ure to my Aman|da, rewards me for tedious months of wretchedne&s;s. Dry up your tears, &s;weet child of early &s;orrow; for the &s;ource of grief exi&s;ts no longer. Lord Cherbury has been kind beyond my warme&s;t expectations, and has given me the ineffable delight, as far as pecuniary mat|ters can do, of rendering the future days of Amanda hap|py. In my next I &s;hall be more explicit: at pre&s;ent I have not a moment I can call my own, which mu&s;t excu&s;e this laconic letter.

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="95" REF="038416_0094_1011E20824E01BF8">
The emotions of Amanda were irrepre&s;&s;ible: the letter dropt from her trembling hands, and her &s;tream|ing eyes were rai&s;ed to heaven. "Oh ble&s;s him," &s;he exclaimed. "Gracious heaven, ble&s;s the benefactor of my father, for this good deed. May &s;orrow or misfor|tune never come acro&s;s his path."</P>
<P>"And who, may I a&s;k," &s;aid Lord Mortimer," mer|its &s;o &s;weet a prayer from Amanda?"</P>
<P>"See," cried &s;he pre&s;enting him the letter, as if happy at the moment to have &s;uch a proof of the truth of what &s;he had alledged to him.</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer was affected by the letter: his eyes filled with tears, and he turned a&s;ide to hide his emotion; recovering him&s;elf, he again approached her. "And while you &s;o &s;weetly pray for the felicity of the father," &s;aid he, "are you re&s;olved on dooming the &s;on to de&s;|pair? If &s;incere penitence can extenuate error, and merit mercy, I de&s;erve to be forgiven."</P>
<P>Amanda ro&s;e, as if with an intention of retiring; but Lord Mortimer caught her hand. "Think not," cried he, "I will lo&s;e the pre&s;ent opportunity, (which I have &s;o long de&s;ired, and with &s;uch difficulty obtain|ed) of entering into a vindication of my conduct: how|ever it may be received by you, it is a ju&s;tice I owe my own character to make; for as I never wilfully injured innocence, &s;o I cannot bear to be con&s;idered its violator. Amid&s;t the wildne&s;s, the extravagance of youth, which with compunction I acknowledge being too often led in|to, my heart &s;till acquitted me of ever committing an act, which could entail upon me the pangs of con&s;cience. Sacred to me has virtue ever been, how lowly &s;oever in &s;ituation.</P>
<P>The idea of his being able to vindicate him&s;elf, &s;carce|ly afforded le&s;s plea&s;ure to Amanda, than it did to Lord Mortimer. She &s;uffered him to re&s;eat her, while he re|lated the circum&s;tances which had led him a&s;tray in his opinion of her. Oh! how fervent was the rapture that pervaded Amanda's heart, when as &s;he li&s;tened to him, &s;he found he was &s;till the amiable, the noble, the gene|rous character, her fancy had fir&s;t conceived him to be.
<PB N="96" REF="038416_0095_1011E20AE4A4D048">
Tears of plea&s;ure, as exqui&s;ite as tho&s;e &s;he had lately &s;hed, again fell from her: for oh! what delight is there in knowing, that an object we cannot help loving, we may &s;till e&s;teem. "Thus," continued Lord Mortimer, "I have accounted for my error; an error, which except on account of your di&s;plea&s;ure, I know not whether I &s;hould regret; as it has convinced me more forcibly than any other circum&s;tance could have done, of the perfections of your mind; and has be&s;ides removed from mine prejudices which cau&s;ele&s;&s;ly I did not entertain again&s;t your &s;ex. Was every woman in a &s;imilar &s;itua|tion to act like you,
<Q><L>&mdash;Such numbers would not in vain,</L>
<L>Of broken vows and faithle&s;s men complain.</L></Q></P>
<P>"To call you mine, is the height of my wi&s;hes: on your deci&s;ion I re&s;t for happine&s;s. Oh! my Amanda, let it be a fovourable deci&s;ion, and &s;uffer me to write to Mr. Fitzalan, and reque&s;t him to be&s;tow on me, the greate&s;t trea&s;ure one being could po&s;&s;ibly receive from another, a woman lovely and educated as you have been."</P>
<P>When he mentioned appealing to her father, Amanda could no longer doubt the &s;incerity of his intentions. Her own heart pleaded as powerfully as his &s;olicitations did for pardoning him; and if &s;he did not ab&s;olutely extend her hand, &s;he at la&s;t &s;uffered it to be taken with|out any reluctance. "I am forgiven then," &s;aid Lord Mortimer, pre&s;&s;ing her to his bo&s;om. "Oh, my Amanda, years of tender attention can never make up for this goodne&s;s!"</P>
<P>When his tran&s;ports were a little abated, he in&s;i&s;ted on writing immediately to Fitzalan: as he &s;ealed the letter, he told Amanda he had reque&s;ted an expeditious an&s;wer. The happine&s;s of the youthful pair was commu|nicated to the hone&s;t ru&s;tics, whom Lord Mortimer li|berally rewarded for their fidelity to his Amanda, and whom &s;he readily excu&s;ed for their ambiguous expre&s;|&s;ions to him; knowing they proceeded from &s;implicity of heart, and a wi&s;h of &s;erving her, yet without injur|ing
<PB N="97" REF="038416_0096_1011E20C705273F0">
them&s;elves, by betraying the manner in which they had procured intelligence of her &s;ituation.</P>
<P>The day after the reconcileation, Lord Mortimer told Amanda, he was compelled, for a &s;hort time to leave her; with what reluctance, he hoped, he &s;aid, &s;he could ea&s;ily perceive; but the vi&s;it which he had come into Wales for the purpo&s;e of paying, had been &s;o long de|ferred, his friend was growing impatient, and threatened to come to Tudor Hall to &s;ee what detained him there. To prevent &s;uch a mea&s;ure, which he knew would be a total interruption to the happine&s;s he enjoyed in her &s;o|ciety, Lord Mortimer added, he intended to pa&s;s a few days with him; hoping by the time he returned there would be a letter from Mr. Fitzalan, which would authorize his immediate preparations for their nuptials. Amanda wi&s;hed (but could not) totally hide the unea&s;i|ne&s;s &s;he felt at the pro&s;pect of a &s;eparation: the idea, however, of his &s;peedy return rendered it but tran&s;ient, and he departed in a few hours after he had mentioned his intention.</P>
<P>Amanda had never before experienced &s;uch happine&s;s as &s;he now enjoyed: &s;he now &s;aw her&s;elf on the point of being elavated to a &s;ituation, (by a man too &s;he adored) which would give her ample opportunities of &s;erving the deare&s;t connexions of her heart, and of gratifying the benevolence of her di&s;po&s;ition, and the elegance of her ta&s;te. Oh! how delightful to think, &s;he &s;hould be able to &s;oothe the declining period of her father's life, by pro|viding for him all the requi&s;ite indulgences of age: oh! how delightful to think, &s;he &s;hould be acce&s;&s;ary to her dear O&s;car's promotion; how rapturous to imagine, at her approach the drooping children of mi&s;ery would brighten with plea&s;ing pre&s;ages of relief, which &s;he &s;hould amply realize. Such were Amanda's anticipations of what &s;he termed the ble&s;&s;ings of an affluent fortune: felicity, in her opinion, was to be diffu&s;ed to be enjoyed. Of Lord Cherbury's &s;anction to the attachment of his &s;on, &s;he entertained not a doubt: her birth was little inferior to his, and fortune was entirely out of the que&s;tion; for

a liberal mind, &s;he thought, could never look to that, when on one &s;ide was already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more than &s;uffi|cient for even the luxuries of life. Such were the ideas of the innocent and romantic Amanda; ideas, which made her &s;eem to tread on air, and which &s;he entertained till &s;ub&s;equent experience convinced her of their fallacy.</P>

<P>AMANDA was &s;itting in the rece&s;s in the garden, the fourth evening of Lord Mortimer's ab|&s;ence, when &s;uddenly &s;he heard the rattling of a car|riage: her heart bounded, and &s;he flew into the hou&s;e; at the very moment a chai&s;e &s;topt at the door, from which, to her inexpre&s;&s;ible amazement, her father de|&s;cended.</P>
<P>Transfixed to the &s;pot, it was many minutes ere &s;he had power to bid him welcome, or return the fond ca|re&s;&s;es he be&s;towed upon her. "I am come, Amanda," &s;aid he, eagerly interrupting the joyful &s;peeches of the Edwins, "to take you away with me; and one hour is all I can give you to prepare your&s;elf."</P>
<P>"Good heaven," &s;aid Amanda, &s;tarting, "to take me away immediately."</P>
<P>"Immediately," he repeated, "And as I know you are attached to this good girl," (turning to Ellen) "I &s;hall be happy, if her parents permit, to procure her attendance for you."</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="038416_0098_1011E211838F8F60">
The Edwins, who would have followed them&s;elves, or allowed any of their family to follow Fitzalan and his daughter round the world, gladly con&s;ented to her going; and the girl, exclu&s;ive of her attachment to Amanda, which was very great, having pined ever &s;ince her lover's departure, rejoiced at the idea of a change of &s;cene.</P>
<P>Not &s;o Amanda: it made her &s;uffer agony, to be torn from Lord Mortimer in the hour of reconciliation and explanation, was more than &s;he could &s;upport with forti|tude. Her father, perhaps, had not received his letter; it was but ju&s;tice then to him and Lord Mortimer to reveal her &s;ituation. She left her trunk half-packed, and went out for that purpo&s;e; but as &s;he &s;tood before him with quivering lips and half averted eyes at a lo&s;s to be|gin, he took her hand, and &s;oftly exclaimed, "My love, let us for the pre&s;ent wave every &s;ubject; the moments are precious, ha&s;ten to put on your habit, or we &s;hall be too late at the &s;tage where I propo&s;e re&s;ting to night." Amanda turned in &s;ilence to her chamber to comply with his de&s;ire, tears ran down her cheeks, and for the fir&s;t time &s;he conceived the idea of being hurried away to avoid Lord Mortimer; but why &s;he co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ld not think,&mdash;honour as well as tenderne&s;s, &s;he thought, demanded her acquainting him with the cau&s;e of her precipitate journey: but when &s;he took up a pen for that purpo&s;e, her hand was un&s;teady, and &s;he was &s;o much di&s;turbed by the nur&s;e and her daughters, who ran backwards and forwards in all the bu&s;tle of preparation, that &s;he could not write: her father prevented a &s;econd effort, for he was continually coming to her chamber door, urging her to be quick, and by thus watching, completely pre|vented her delivering any me&s;&s;age to the nur&s;e for Lord Mortimer; &s;o great was his eagerne&s;s to depart, he would not &s;uffer the hor&s;es to be taken from the chai&s;e or any refre&s;hment to be brought him by the Edwins, notwith&s;tanding their pre&s;&s;ing intreaties, nei|ther would he an&s;wer their interrogatories as to where he was going, &s;aying they &s;hould know hereafter; the parting embrace was at la&s;t given and received with a heavy heart&mdash;Amanda was handed to the carriage&mdash;&s;i|lence

prevailed&mdash;all the travellers were equally though differently affected; the cottage and the &s;pire of the vil|lage church had awakened the mo&s;t affecting remem|brances in the mind of Fitzalan, and tears fell from him to the memory of his unfortunate Malvina; &s;ighs bur&s;t from Amanda as &s;he viewed the white turrets of Tudor Hall and Ellen &s;obbed on pa&s;&s;ing the for&s;aken cottage of poor Chip. From all the&s;e affecting and beloved objects the rapidity of the carriage &s;oon conveyed them, but the impre&s;&s;ions they left upon their mind were not &s;o ea&s;ily eradicated; Fitzalan was the fir&s;t to break the un&s;ocial &s;ilence, and it &s;eemed as if he did &s;o for the purpo&s;e of rou&s;ing the dejection of his daughter: a cro&s;s road from the cottage &s;hortly brought them to Conway ferry, which they were obliged to pa&s;s, and here had Amanda's mind been at ea&s;e, &s;he would have felt truly gratified by viewing the remains of a gothic magnificence which Ca&s;tle Conway exhibited; as it was &s;he could not behold them unmoved, and, whil&s;t &s;he admired, &s;he gave the pa&s;&s;ing tribute of a &s;igh to grandeur and decay. They only continued in Conway till a carriage was provided for them, and &s;oon came beneath the &s;tupendous projec|tions of Penmaenmawr; this was a &s;cene as new as aw|ful to Amanda: "well, Cot in heaven ple&s;s their &s;ouls," Ellen &s;aid, "what a tefil of a way they &s;hould be in if one of them huge &s;tones rolled down upon the carriage." They &s;topped not again till they reached Bangor ferry where they were to re&s;t for the night; Amanda's &s;trength and &s;pirits were now &s;o entirely exhau&s;ted, that had not a gla&s;s of wine been immediately procured her, &s;he would have fainted from weakne&s;s; this a little revived her, and the tears &s;he &s;hed relieved in &s;ome degree the oppre&s;&s;ions of her heart; her father left her and Ellen together, while he went to give directions about the journey of the en&s;uing day.</P>
<P>Amanda went to the window and threw up the &s;a&s;h, the air from the mountains &s;he thought refre&s;hed her; the darkne&s;s of the hour was oppo&s;ed by a bright moon, which call a trembling radiance upon the water, and by its partial gleams exhibited a beautiful &s;cene of light

By the dawn of next morning the ve&s;&s;el entered the bay of Dublin, and Fitzalan &s;hort|ly after brought Amanda <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rom the cabin to contemplate a &s;cene which far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all her ideas of &s;ublimity and beauty, a &s;cene which the ri&s;ing &s;un &s;oon heightened to the mo&s;t glowing radiance; they landed at the Marine Hotel, where they breakfa&s;ted and then proceeded in a carriage to an hotel in Capel-&s;treet, where they propo&s;ed &s;taying a few days for the purpo&s;e of enjoying O&s;car's company, who&s;e regiment was quartered in Dublin, and making &s;ome requi&s;ite purcha&s;es for their journey to the north: as the carriage drove down Capel-&s;treet, Amanda &s;aw a young officer &s;tanding at the corner of Mary's

<P>THE raptures of this meeting &s;urpa&s;&s;ed de|&s;cription; to O&s;car they were heightened by &s;urpri&s;e; he was unfortunately that day on guard at the bank, therefore could only pay them a few &s;hort and &s;tolen vi|&s;its, but the next morning, the moment he was reliev|ed, he came to them. Fitzalan had given Amanda money to purcha&s;e whatever &s;he deemed nece&s;&s;ary for her conve|nience and amu&s;ement, and O&s;car attended her to the mo&s;t celebrated &s;hops to make her purcha&s;es: having &s;up|plied her&s;elf with a pretty fa&s;hionable a&s;&s;ortment for her wardrobe, &s;he procured a &s;mall collection of books &s;uffi|cient however, from their excellence to form a little libra|ry in them&s;elves, and every requi&s;ite for drawing; nor did &s;he forget the little want and vanities of Ellen: they returned about dinner time to the hotel, where they found their father, who had been tran&s;acting bu&s;ine&s;s for Lord Cherbury in different parts of the town. We may now &s;uppo&s;e him in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of happine&s;s, ble&s;&s;ed as he was in the &s;ociety of his children, and the certainty of a competence; but, alas! happine&s;s has almo&s;t ever an attendant draw-back, and he now experi|enced one of the mo&s;t corroding kind from the alteration

he witne&s;&s;ed in his &s;on: O&s;car was improved in per&s;on, but his eyes no longer beamed with animation, and the ro&s;e upon his cheek was pale, his cheerfulne&s;s no longer appeared &s;pontaneous, but con&s;trained, as if a&s;&s;umed for the purpo&s;e of veiling deep and heartfelt &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Fitzalan, with all the anxiety and tenderne&s;s of a pa|rent, delicately expre&s;&s;ed his wi&s;h of learning the &s;ource of his unea&s;ine&s;s, that by &s;o doing he might be better qualified to alleviate it, hinting at the &s;ame time, in in|direct terms, that if occa&s;ioned by any of the impruden|cies which youth is &s;ometimes inadvertently led into, he would readily excu&s;e them, from a certainty that he who repented never would again commit them. O&s;car &s;tart|ed from the remote&s;t hint of divulging his unea&s;ine&s;s; he begged his father, however, to believe, (&s;ince he had unfortunately perceived it) that it was not derived from imprudence; he pretended to &s;ay it was but a &s;light chagrin which would &s;oon wear away of it&s;elf if not re|newed by inquiries. Fitzalan, however, was too much affected by the &s;ubject to drop it as readily as O&s;car wi&s;h|ed. After regarding him for a few minutes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> an at|tention as mournful as fixed (while they &s;ac round the table after dinner) he &s;uddenly exclaimed, "Alas, my dear boy, I fear things are wor&s;e within than you will allow." "Now, indeed, O&s;car," cried Amanda, &s;weetly &s;miling on him, anxious to relieve him from the embarra&s;&s;met the&s;e words had involved him in, and to di&s;&s;ipate the deep gloom of her father's brow, "tho' never in the wars, I fancy you are not quite heart whole!" He an&s;wered her with affected gaiety; but, as if wi&s;hing to change the di&s;cour&s;e, &s;uddenly &s;poke of Colonel Belgrave, who, at pre&s;ent, he &s;aid, was ab&s;ent from the regiment; occupied by his own feelings, he ob&s;erved not the glow which mantled the cheeks of his father and &s;i&s;ter at that name.</P>
<P>"You know Mrs. Belgrave," &s;aid Amanda, endea|vouring to regain compo&s;ure. "Know her!" repeated he, with an involuntary &s;igh&punc; "oh, yes!" Then after the pau&s;e of a few minutes, turning to his father, "I
<PB N="110" REF="038416_0109_1011E22A47FBD6A8">
believe I have already informed you, Sir," he &s;aid, "that &s;he is the daughter of your brave old friend, General Honeywood, who, I a&s;&s;ure you, paid me no little at|tention on your account, his hou&s;e is quite the temple of ho&s;pitality, and &s;he the little pre&s;iding godde&s;s." "She is happy, I hope," &s;aid Amanda. "Oh, &s;urely!" replied O&s;car, little thinking of the &s;ecret motive his &s;i&s;ter had for a&s;king &s;uch a que&s;tion, "&s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es what the world thinks nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute felicity."</P>
<P>Fitzalan had accounted to his &s;on for leaving Devon|&s;hire, by &s;aying the air had di&s;agreed with Amanda: he told him of the friend&s;hip of Lord Cherbury, from which he &s;aid he tru&s;ted &s;hortly to be able to have him promoted. "Be a&s;&s;ured, my dear O&s;car, mo&s;t willing|ly would I relinqui&s;h many of the comforts of life to attain the ability of ha&s;tening your advancement, or adding to your happine&s;s." "My happine&s;s!" O&s;car mournfully repeated, tears filled his eyes; he could no longer re&s;train them, and &s;tarting up, hurried to a win|dow. Amanda followed, unutterably affected at his emotion: "O&s;car, my dear O&s;car, &s;aid &s;he, as &s;he flung her arms round his neck, "you di&s;tre&s;s me beyond ex|pre&s;&s;ion." He &s;at down, and leaning his head on her bo&s;om, as &s;he &s;tood before him, his tears fell through her handkerchief. "Oh, heavens!" exclaimed Fitza|lan, cla&s;ping his hands together, "what a &s;ight is this! Oh! my children, from your felicity alone could I ever derive any; if the hope I entertained of that felicity is di&s;appointed, the heart which cheri&s;hed it mu&s;t &s;oon be &s;ilent." He aro&s;e, and went to them: Yet," continu|ed he, "amid&s;t the angui&s;h of this moment, I feel a ray of plea&s;ure at perceiving an affection &s;o &s;trong and tender between you; it will be a mutual con&s;olation and &s;upport when the feeble help and protection I can give is finally removed: oh then, my O&s;car." He pro|ceeded while he folded their united hands in his, "be|come the &s;oothing friend and guardian of this dear, this amiable, this too lovely girl&mdash;let her not too &s;everely feel&mdash;too bitterly mourn&mdash;the lo&s;s of an unhappy father."</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="038416_0110_1011E22C75C23118">
Amanda's tears began to &s;tream, and O&s;car's for a few minutes were increa&s;ed. "Excu&s;e me," at la&s;t he &s;aid, making an effort to exert him&s;elf, to his father, "and be a&s;&s;ured, to the utmo&s;t of my ability I will ever obey your wi&s;hes, and fulfil your expectations: I am a&s;hamed of the weakne&s;s I have betrayed&mdash;I will yield to it no more&mdash;forget therefore your having &s;een it, or at lea&s;t remember it without pain, as I &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ure you, no effort on my part &s;hall be untried to con|quer it entirely; and now let the &s;hort time we have to continue together be devoted to cheerfulne&s;s."</P>
<P>Soon after this he mentioned Parker's performance in Marlborough green, and propo&s;ed, as it was no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the hour, taking Amanda there; the propo&s;al was not ob|jected to, and Ellen, who they knew would particularly delight in &s;uch an amu&s;ement, was committed to the care of O&s;car's &s;ervant, a &s;mart young &s;oldier, who e&s;|corted her with much gallantry. The green was ex|tremely crouded, particularly with officers, who&s;e wan|dering glances were &s;oon attracted to Amanda, as one of the mo&s;t elegant girls pre&s;ent. O&s;car was &s;oon &s;ur|rounded by them, and compelled, not only to gratify their curio&s;ity, by di&s;covering who &s;he was, but their gallantry by introducing them to her. Their compli|ments &s;oon diverted her attention from the exhibition; and Ellen, who &s;at behind her on a bench, afforded in|nocent mirth by her remarks. "Ple&s;s her &s;oul and poty too," &s;he &s;aid "it was the mo&s;t comical and wonderful|e&s;t &s;ight &s;he had ever &s;een in her porn tays." A &s;tring of red coats would have attended Amanda to the hotel, had not O&s;car prevented it.</P>
<P>The next day was devoted to vi&s;iting the public build|ings, the park, and a few of the mo&s;t beautiful places in its vicinage. On the en&s;uing morn Fitzalan and A|manda continued their journey to the north, where O&s;|car a&s;&s;ured them he expected leave to vi&s;it them the fol|lowing &s;ummer, after the reviews were over; as he help|ed his &s;i&s;ter into the carriage, &s;he put a pocket book in|to his hand (given by her father for that purpo&s;e) which contained &s;omething to repleni&s;h his pur&s;e.</P>

<P>OSCAR's regiment, on his fir&s;t joining it in Ireland, was quartered in Enni&s;kellen, the corps was agreeable, and the inhabitants of the town ho&s;pitable and polite. He felt all the delight of a young and en|terpri&s;ing mind, entering, to what appeared to him, the road to glory and plea&s;ure; many of his idle morn|ings were &s;pent in rambling about the country, &s;ome|times accompanied by a party of officers, and &s;ometimes alone.</P>
<P>In one of his &s;olitary excur&s;ions along the beautiful banks of Lough Erne, with a light fu&s;ee on his &s;houl|der, as the woods, that almo&s;t de&s;cended to the edge of the water abounded in game, after proceeding a few miles he felt quite exhau&s;ted by the heat, which as it was now the middle of &s;ummer, was inten&s;e; at a lit|tle di&s;tance he perceived an orchard, who&s;e glowing ap|ples promi&s;ed a delightful repa&s;t; knowing that the fruit in many of the neighbouring places was kept for &s;ale, he re&s;olved on trying if any was to be purcha&s;ed here, and accordingly opened a &s;mall gate and a&s;cended
<PB N="113" REF="038416_0112_1011E230C16099A0">
through a gra&s;s grown path in the orchard to a very plain white cottage, which &s;tood on a gently &s;loping lawn, &s;urrounded by a rude pailing, he knocked again&s;t the door with his fu&s;ee, and immediately a little ro&s;y girl appeared, "tell me my pretty la&s;s," cried he "whether I can purcha&s;e any of the&s;e fine apples I &s;ee here." "Anan!" exclaimed the girl, with a fooli&s;h &s;tare. O&s;car glancing at the moment into the pa&s;&s;age, &s;aw from a half clo&s;ed door nearly oppo&s;ite the one at which he &s;tood, a beautiful fair face peeping out; he involuntarily &s;tarted, and pu&s;hing a&s;ide the girl, made a &s;tep into the pa&s;&s;age, the room door directly opened, and an elderly woman, of a genteel figure, and plea&s;ing countenance, appeared. "Good heavens!" cried O&s;car, taking off his hat, and reteating. I fear I have been guilty of the highe&s;t impertinence, the only apology I can offer is by &s;aying it was not intentional, I am quite a &s;tranger here, and having been informed mo&s;t of the orchards here abouts contained fruit for &s;ale I intruded under that idea." "Your mi&s;take, Sir," &s;he replied, with a benevolent &s;mile, "is too trifling to require an apology, nor &s;hall it be attended with any di&s;appoint|ment to you.</P>
<P>She then politely &s;hewed him into the parlour, where, with equal plea&s;ure and admiration, he cont<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">mplated the fair being of whom before he had but a tran&s;ient glance; &s;he appeared to be &s;carcely &s;eventeen, and was, both as to face and figure, what a painter would have cho&s;en to copy for the portrait of a little playful Hebe; though be|low even the middle &s;ize, &s;he was formed with the nice&s;t &s;ymmetry, her &s;kin was of dazzling fairne&s;s, and &s;o tran&s;parent that the veins were clearly di&s;cernable; the &s;ofte&s;t blu&s;h of nature &s;haded her beautifully rounded cheeks, her mouth was &s;mall and pouting, and whenever &s;he &s;miled a thou&s;and graces &s;ported round it; her eyes were full and of a heavenly blue, &s;oft, yet animated, giving, like the expre&s;&s;ion of her whole countenance, an idea of innocence, &s;pirit, and &s;en&s;ibility; her hair, of the pale&s;t and mo&s;t glo&s;&s;y brown, hung carele&s;&s;ly about her, and, though dre&s;s in a loo&s;e morning gown of
<PB N="114" REF="038416_0113_1011E2324FEF21D0">
mu&s;lin, &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an air of fa&s;hion, and even con&s;e|con&s;equence: the ea&s;y manner in which &s;he bore the looks of O&s;car proclaimed her at once unaccu&s;tomed to admi|ration, nor di&s;plea&s;ed with that &s;he now received: for that O&s;car admired her could not but be vi&s;ible, and he &s;ome|times fancied he &s;aw an arch &s;mile playing over her fea|tures, at the involuntary glances he directed towards her.</P>
<P>A fine ba&s;ket of apples and &s;ome delicious cyder was brought to O&s;car, and he found his entertainer as ho&s;pi|table in di&s;po&s;ition as &s;he was plea&s;ing in conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>The beautiful interior of the cottage by no means corre&s;ponded with the plainne&s;s of the exterior, the fur|niture was elegantly neat, and the room ornamented with a variety of &s;ine prints and land&s;capes; a large folding gla&s;s door opened from it into a plea&s;ure garden.</P>
<P>Adela, &s;o was the charming young &s;tranger called, chatted in the mo&s;t lively and familiar terms, and at la&s;t running over to the ba&s;ket, to&s;t the apples all about the table&punc; and picking out the fine&s;t pre&s;ented them to O&s;car. 'Tis &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay he received them with emotion, but how tran&s;ient is all &s;ublunary bli&s;s. A <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> clock, over O&s;car's head, by &s;triking three, re|minded him that he had pa&s;&s;ed near two hours in the cottage. "Oh heavens," cried he, &s;tarting, "I have made a mo&s;t uncon&s;cionable intru&s;ion; you &s;ee, my dear ladies," bowing re&s;pectfully to both, "the con&s;equence of being too polite and too fa&s;cinating." He repeated his thanks in the mo&s;t animated manner, and &s;natching up his hat departed, yet not without ca&s;ting
<Q><L>"One longing, lingering, look behind."</L></Q></P>
<P>The &s;ound of foot&s;teps after him in the lawn made him turn, and he perceived the ladies had followed him thi|ther; he &s;topped again to &s;peak to them, and extolled the lovely pro&s;pect they had from that eminence, of the lake and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;cattered i&s;lands. "I pre&s;ume," &s;aid Adela, handling the fu&s;ee on which he leaned, "you were trying your &s;ucce&s;s to day in fowling?" "Yes, but as you per|ceive, I have been un&s;ucce&s;sful." "Then, I a&s;&s;ure you," &s;aid &s;he, with an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;mile, "there is choice game to
<PB N="115" REF="038416_0114_1011E213D1318128">
be found in our woods." "Delicious game, indeed!" cried he, interrupting the archne&s;s of her look, and ani|mated by it to touch her hand, "but only tantalizing to a keen &s;port&s;man, who &s;ees it elevated above his reach." "Come, come," exclaimed the old lady, with a &s;udden gravity, "we are detaining the gentleman." She took her fair companion by the arm and ha&s;tily turned to the cottage. O&s;car gazed after them a moment, then with a half &s;mothered &s;igh, de&s;cended to the road. He could not help thinking this incident of the morning very like the novel adventures he had &s;ometimes read to his &s;i&s;ter Amanda as &s;he &s;at at work, and to compleat the re&s;em|blance, thought he, I mu&s;t fall in love with the little he|roine. Ah! O&s;car, beware of &s;uch imprudence, guard your heart with all your care again&s;t tender impre&s;&s;ions, till fortune has been more propitious to you; thus would my father &s;peak, mu&s;ed O&s;car, and &s;et his own misfor|tunes in terrible array before me, were he now pre&s;ent; well I mu&s;t endeavour to act as if he were here to exhort me. Heigh ho! proceeded he, &s;houldering his fu&s;ee, glory for &s;ome time to come mu&s;t be my mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The next morning the fu&s;ee was again taken down, and he &s;al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ied out, carefully avoiding the officers, le&s;t any of them &s;hould offer to accompany him, for he felt a &s;trange reluctance to their participating either the &s;miles of Adela or the apples of the old lady. Upon his arrival at the orchard, finding the gate open, he ad|vanced a few &s;teps up the path, and had a glimp&s;e of the cottage, but no object was vi&s;ible. O&s;car was too mo|de&s;t to attempt entering it uninvited, he therefore turn|ed back, yet often ca&s;t a look behind him; no one howe|ver was to be &s;een; he now began to feel the heat op|pre&s;&s;ive, and him&s;elf fatigued with his walk, and &s;at down upon a mo&s;s covered &s;tone, on the margin of the lake, at a little di&s;tance from the cottage, beneath the &s;preading branches of a hawthorn, his hat and fu&s;ee were laid at his feet, and a cool breeze from the water refre&s;hed him; upon its &s;mooth &s;urface a number of boats and &s;mall &s;ail ve&s;&s;els were now gliding about in various directions, and enlivened the enchanting pro&s;|pect
<PB N="116" REF="038416_0115_1011E2378A44EBE8">
which was &s;pread upon the bo&s;om of the lake: from contemplating it he was &s;uddenly rou&s;ed by the warble of a female voice; he &s;tarted, turned, and beheld Ade|la ju&s;t by him. "Ble&s;s me!" cried &s;he, "who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ould have thought of &s;eeing you here, why you look quite fatigued, and, I believe, want apples to day a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> as you did ye&s;terday." Then &s;itting down on the &s;eat he had re&s;igned, &s;he to&s;t off her bonnet, declaring it was in&s;upportably warm, and began rummaging a &s;mall work bag &s;he held on her arm. O&s;car &s;natching the bonnet from the ground, Adela flu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">g apples into it, Ob|&s;erving it would make an excellent ba&s;ket. He &s;at down at her feet, and never perhaps felt &s;uch a variety of emotions as at the pre&s;ent moment: his cheeks glow|ed with a brighter colour, and his eyes were rai&s;ed to her's with the mo&s;t ardent admiration; yet not to them alone could he confine the expre&s;&s;ion of his feelings, they broke in half formed &s;entences from his lips, which Adela heard with the mo&s;t perfect compo&s;ure, de&s;iring him either to eat or pocket his apples quickly, as &s;he wanted her bonnet, being in a great hurry to return to the cottage, from which &s;he had made a kind of &s;tolen march. The apples were in&s;tantly committed to his pocket and he was permitted to tye on the bonnet. A depraved man might have mi&s;interpreted the gaiety of Adela, or at lea&s;t endeavoured to take advantage of it, but the &s;acred impre&s;&s;ion of virtue, which nature and education had &s;tamped upon the heart of O&s;car, was in|delibly fixed, and he neither &s;u&s;pected, nor for worlds would have attempted, injuring the innocence of Adela; he beheld her (in what indeed was a true light) as a lit|tle playful nymph, who&s;e actions were the offspring of innocence.</P>
<P>"I a&s;&s;ure you," exclaimed &s;he ri&s;ing, "I am very loath to quit this plea&s;ant &s;eat, but if I make a much longer delay, I &s;hall find the lady of the cottage in anxious expectation. "May I advance?" &s;aid O&s;car, as he pu&s;hed open the gate for her. "If you do," re|plied &s;he, "the lea&s;t that will be &s;aid from &s;eeing us to|gether, is that we were in &s;earch of each other the
<PB N="117" REF="038416_0116_1011E239ABD33530">
whole of the morning." "Well," cried, O&s;car, laugh|ing at this carele&s;s &s;peech, "and if they do &s;ay &s;o, it would not be doing me inju&s;tice." "Adieu, adieu," &s;aid &s;he, waving her hand, "not another word for a kingdom."</P>
<P>What a compound of beauty and giddine&s;s it is, thought O&s;car, watching her till &s;he entered the cot|tage. As he returned from the &s;weet &s;pot he met &s;ome labourers, from whom he enquired concerning its owner and learned &s;he was a re&s;pectable widow lady of the name of Marlowe.</P>
<P>On O&s;car's return from Enni&s;kellen, he heard from the officers that General Honeywood, an old veteran, who had a fine e&s;tate about fourteen miles from the town, was that morning to pay his compliments to them, and that cards had been left for a grand fete and ball, which he annually gave on the fir&s;t of July, to comme|morate one of the glorious victories of King William. Every per&s;on of any fa&s;hion in and about the neighbour|hood was on &s;uch occa&s;ions &s;ure of an invitation, and the officers were plea&s;ed with theirs, as they had for &s;ome time wi&s;hed for an opportunity of &s;eeing the Ge|neral's daughter, who was very much admired.</P>
<P>The general, like a true veteran, retained an enthu&s;i|a&s;tic attachment for the profe&s;&s;ion of arms, to which not only the morning, but the meridian of his life had been devoted, and which he had not quitted till compelled by a debilitated con&s;titution. Seated in his paternal man|&s;ion. he began to experience the want of a faithful com|panion, who would heighten the enjoyments of the tran|quil hour, and &s;oothe the infirmities of age; this want was &s;oon &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ppled by his union with a young lady in the neighbourhood, who&s;e only dowry was innocence and beauty; from the great di&s;parity of their ages, it was concluded &s;he had married for convenience, but the tenor of her conduct changed this opinion, by proving the gen|eral po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her tendere&s;t affections, a happier couple were not known; but this happine&s;s was terminated as &s;uddenly as fatally by her death, which happened two years after the birth of her daughter; all the general's

love was then centered in her child. Many of the ladies in the neighbourhood, induced by the well known felicity his lady had enjoyed, or by the largene&s;s of his fortune, made attempts to engage him again in matrimonial toils, but he &s;ought &s;hy of them all, &s;olemnly declaring, "he would never bring a &s;tep mother over his dear girl." In her infancy &s;he was his plaything, and as &s;he grew up, his comfort; care&s;&s;ed, flattered, adored, from her child|hood, &s;he &s;carcely knew the meaning of har&s;hne&s;s and contradiction; a naturally &s;weet di&s;po&s;ition, and the &s;u|perintending care of an excellent woman, prevented any pernicious effect from &s;uch exce&s;&s;ive indulgence as &s;he received; to di&s;gui&s;e, or duplicity, &s;he was a perfect &s;tranger, her own feelings were never concealed, and others &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed equally &s;incere in revealing theirs; true, the open avowal of her regard or contempt often incurred the imputation of imprudence, but had &s;he even heard of it, &s;he would only have laughed at it, for the general declared whatever &s;he &s;aid was right, and her own heart a&s;&s;ured her of the innocence of her intentions. As &s;he grew up the hou&s;e again became the &s;eat of gaie|ty, the General, though very infirm, felt his convivial &s;pirit revive, he delighted in the &s;ociety of his friends, and could &s;till</P>

<P>O&s;car, actuated by an impul&s;e, which if he could, he, at lea&s;t, did not &s;trive to account for, continued daily to parade before the orchard, but without again &s;eeing Adela.</P>
<P>At length the day for General Honeywood's entertain|ment arrived, and the officers, accompanied by a large party, &s;et off early for Woodlawn, the name of the General's &s;eat; it was &s;ituated on the borders of the lake, where they found barges waiting to convey them to a &s;mall i&s;land, which was the &s;cene of the morning's amu&s;ement; the breakfa&s;t was laid out amid&s;t the ruins of an ancient building, which, from the venerable re|mains of its gothic elegance, was mo&s;t probably, in the days of religious enthu&s;ia&s;m, the &s;eat of &s;acred p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ety:
<PB N="119" REF="038416_0118_1011E23D07242000">
the old trees in groups formed a thick canopy over head, and the ivy that crept along the walls filled up many of the niches where the windows had formerly been; tho&s;e that &s;till remained open, by de&s;cending to the ground, afforded a mo&s;t enchanting pro&s;pect of the lake; the long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of arches which compo&s;ed the body of the chapel, were in many places covered with creeping mo&s;s, and &s;cattered over with wall flowers, blue hair bells, and other &s;pontaneous productions of nature, while between them were placed &s;eats and breakfa&s;t tables, ornamented in a fanciful manner.</P>
<P>The officers experienced a mo&s;t agreeable &s;urpri&s;e on entering, but how inferior were their feelings to the &s;en|&s;ations which O&s;car felt, when introduced with the par|ty by the General to his daughter, he beheld in Mi&s;s Honeywood the lovely Adela. She &s;eemed to enjoy his &s;urpri&s;e, and Mrs. Marlowe, from the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the table, beckoned him to her with an arch look; he flew round, and &s;he made room for him by her&s;elf: "Well, my friend," cried &s;he, "do you think you &s;hall find the General's fruit as tempting as mine." "Ah!" exclaimed O&s;car, half &s;ighing half &s;miling, "he&s;peri|an fruit, I fear which I can never hope to obtain." Adela's attention during breakfa&s;t was too much engro&s;|&s;ed by the company to allow her to notice O&s;car more than by a few ha&s;ty words and &s;miles. There being no dancing till the evening, the company, after breakfa&s;t di&s;per&s;ed according to their various inclinations.</P>
<P>The i&s;land was diver&s;ified with little acclivities, and &s;cattered over with wild &s;hrubs, which embalmed the air; temporary arbors of laurel, intermingled with lilies, were erected and laid out with fruits, ices, and other refre&s;hments; upon the edge of the water a mar|quee was pitched for the regimental band, which Colonel Belgrave had politely complimented the General with; a flag was hoi&s;ted on it, and upon a low eminence a few &s;mall field-pieces were mounted, attendants were every where di&s;per&s;ed, dre&s;&s;ed in white &s;treamers, ornamented with a profu&s;ion of orange coloured ribbons, the boat|men were dre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame livery, and the barges, in

which &s;everal of the party were to vi&s;it the other i&s;lands, made a picture&s;que appearance with their gay &s;treamers, fluttering in the breeze; the mu&s;ic now &s;oftly dying away upon the water, now gradually &s;welling on the breeze, and echoed back by the neighbouring hills, ad|ded to the plea&s;ures of the &s;cene.</P>
<P>O&s;car followed the &s;teps of Adela, but at the very moment on which he &s;aw her di&s;engaged from a large party, the General hallooed after him from a &s;hady bank on which he &s;at; O&s;car could not refu&s;e the &s;ummons, and as he approached, the general, extending his hand, gave him a cordial &s;queeze, and welcomed him as the &s;on of a brave man he had once intimately known. "I re|collected the name of Fitzalan," &s;aid he, "the moment I heard it mentioned, and had the happine&s;s of learning from colonel Belgrave I was not mi&s;taken in believing you to be the &s;on of my old friend." He now made &s;e|veral inquiries concerning Fitzalan, and the affectionate manner in which he mentioned him was truly plea&s;ing to O&s;car. "He had once," he &s;aid, "&s;aved his life at the imminent danger of his own, and it was an obligation, while that life remained, he never could forget."</P>
<P>Like Don Guzman in Gil Blas, the general delighted in fighting over his battles, and now proceeded to enume|rate many incidents which happened during the Ameri|can war, when he and Fitzalan &s;erved in the &s;ame regi|ment. O&s;car could well have di&s;pen&s;ed with &s;uch an enumeration; but the General, who had no idea that he was not as much delighted in hearing as he was in &s;peaking, &s;till went on. Adela had been watching them for &s;ome time; her patience at length, like O&s;car's, being exhau&s;ted, &s;he ran forward, and told her father" he mu&s;t not detain him another minute, for they were going upon the lake, and you know papa," cried &s;he, "again&s;t we come back, you can have all your battles ar|ranged in proper form, though by the bye, I don't think it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of an old &s;oldier to intimidate a young one with &s;uch dreadful tales of iron wars." The Gene|ral called her a &s;aucy baggage, ki&s;&s;ed her with rapture, and &s;aw her trip off with his young friend, who &s;eized
<PB N="121" REF="038416_0120_1011E2435A81C440">
the favourable opportunity to engage her for the fir&s;t &s;et in the evening. About four the company a&s;&s;embled in the Abbey to dinner, the band played during the repa&s;t, the toa&s;ts were proclaimed by &s;ound of trumpet, and an&s;wered by an immediate di&s;charge from the Mount. At &s;ix the ladies returned to Woodlawn to change their dre&s;&s;es for the ball, and now
<Q><L>"Awful beauty put on all its charms."</L></Q></P>
<P>Tea and coffee were &s;erved in the re&s;pective rooms, and by eleven the ball-room was completely crowded with company, at once brilliant and lively, particularly the gentlemen, who were not a little elevated by the General's potent libations to the glorious memory of him who&s;e victory they were celebrating.</P>
<P>Adela, adorned in a &s;tile &s;uperior to what O&s;car had yet &s;een, appeared more lovely than he had even fir&s;t thought her; her dre&s;s, which was of thin mu&s;lin &s;pan|gled, was &s;o contrived as to give a kind of aerial light|ne&s;s to her figure. O&s;car reminded her of the promi&s;e of the morning at the very moment the Colonel ap|proached for the purpo&s;e of engaging her; &s;he in&s;tantly informed him of her engagement to Mr. Fitzalan. "Mr. Fitzalan!" repeated the Colonel, with the haugh|ty air of a man who thought he had rea&s;on to be offend|ed; "he has been rather precipitate indeed, but though we may envy, who &s;hall wonder at his anxiety to engage Mi&s;s Honeywood."</P>
<P>Dancing now commenced&punc; and the elegant figure of Adela never appeared to greater advantage; the tran&s;|ported General watched every movement, and, "incom|parable by Jove!&mdash;what a &s;weet angel &s;he is!" were ex|pre&s;&s;ions of admiration which involuntarily broke from him in the pride and fondne&s;s of his heart. O&s;car too, who&s;e figure was remarkably fine, &s;hared his admiration, and he declared to Colonel Belgrave he did not think the world could produce &s;uch another couple; this a&s;&s;er|tion was by no means plea&s;ing to the Colonel; he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed as much vanity, perhaps, as ever fell to the &s;hare
<PB N="122" REF="038416_0121_1011E245CA97C2F0">
of a young belle, con&s;cious of perfections, and dete&s;ted the idea of having any competitor (at lea&s;t &s;uch a pow|erful one as O&s;car) in the good graces of the ladies. Adela having concluded the dance, complained of fa|tigue, and retired to an alcove, whither O&s;car followed her; the window commanded a view of the lake, the little i&s;land and the ruined abbey; the moon, in full &s;plendor, ca&s;t her &s;ilvery light over all tho&s;e objects, giving a &s;oftne&s;s to the land&s;cape even more plea&s;ing than the glowing charms it had derived from the radian|cy of day. Adela in dancing had dropped the bandeau from her hair, O&s;car took it up, and &s;till retained it; Adela now &s;tretched forth her hand to take it; "Al|low me," cried he, gently-taking her hand, "to keep it; to-morrow you would ca&s;t it away as a trifle, but I would trea&s;ure it as a relique of ine&s;timable value; let me have &s;ome memento of the charming hours! have pa&s;&s;ed to-day." "Oh! a truce," &s;aid Adela, "with &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions, (who did not, however, oppo&s;e his put|ting her bandeau in his bo&s;om) they are quite common|place, and have already been repeated to hundreds, and will again, I make no doubt."&mdash;"This is your opinion."&mdash;"Yes, really."&mdash;"Oh! would to heaven," exclaimed O&s;car, "I dur&s;t convince you how mi&s;taken a one it is." Adela, laughing, a&s;&s;ured him that would be a difficult matter. O&s;car grew pen&s;ive; "I think," cried he, if oppre&s;&s;ed by misfortune, I &s;hould of all places on earth like a &s;eclu&s;ion in the old Abbey." "Why, real|ly," &s;aid Adela, "it is tolerably calculated for an her|mitage, and if you take a &s;olitary whim, I beg I may be apprized of it in time, as I &s;hould receive peculiar plea&s;ure in preparing your mo&s;&s;y couch and frugal fare." "The rea&s;on for my liking it," replied he, "would be the pro&s;pect I &s;hould have from it of Woodlawn."&mdash;"And does Woodlawn," a&s;ked Adela, "contain &s;uch particular charms, as to render a view of it &s;o very de|lightful?"</P>
<P>At this moment they were &s;ummoned to call a new dance, a &s;ummons, perhaps, not agreeable to either, as it interrupted an intere&s;ting tete-a-tete. The Colonel
<PB N="123" REF="038416_0122_1011E249229948D8">
engaged Adela for the next &s;et; and though O&s;car had no inclination to dance, to avoid particularity, he &s;tood up with a young lady who was e&s;teemed extremely hand|&s;ome. Adela, as if fatigued, no longer moved with animation, and &s;uddenly interrupted the Colonel in a gallant &s;peech he was making her, to inquire "if he thought Mi&s;s O Neal (O&s;car's partner) pretty&mdash;&s;o very pretty as &s;he was generally thought?" the Colonel was too keen not to di&s;cover at once the motive which &s;ug|ge&s;ted this inquiry. "Why, faith, cried he, after examining Mi&s;s O'Neal &s;ome minutes through an opera gla&s;s, "the girl has charms, but &s;o totally eclip&s;ed at pre&s;ent, (looking langui&s;hingly at Adela) in my eyes, that I cannot do them the ju&s;tice they may perhaps me|rit; Fitzalan, however, by the homage he pays her, &s;eems as if he would make up for the deficiency of eve|ry other per&s;on." Adela turned pale, and took the fir&s;t opportunity of demanding her bandeau from O&s;car: he, &s;miling, refu&s;ed it, declaring it was a trophy of the happine&s;s he had enjoyed that day, and that the General &s;hould have informed her a &s;oldier never relinqui&s;hed &s;uch a glorious memento." "Re&s;ign mine," replied Adela, "and procure one from Mi&s;s O'Neal."&mdash;"No!" cried he, "I would not pay her charms and my own &s;incerity &s;o bad a compliment, as to a&s;k what I &s;hould not in the lea&s;t degree value." Adela's &s;pirits reviv|ed, and &s;he repeated her reque&s;t no more.</P>
<P>The dancing continued after &s;upper, with little inter|mi&s;&s;ion, till &s;even, when the company repaired to the &s;aloon to breakfa&s;t, after which they di&s;per&s;ed. The General particularly and affectionately bid O&s;car fare|well, and charged him to con&s;ider Woodlawn as his head quarters. "Be a&s;&s;ured" &s;aid the good natured old man, "the &s;on of my brave, worthy and long re&s;pected friend, will ever be valuable to my heart and welcome to my home; and would to heaven, in the calm evening of life, your father and I had pitched our tents nearer each other."</P>
<P>From this period O&s;car became almo&s;t an inmate of his hou&s;e, and the general &s;hortly grew &s;o attached to
<PB N="124" REF="038416_0123_1011E24AAEF85A60">
him, that he felt unhappy if deprived of his &s;ociety; the attentions he received from O&s;car were &s;uch as an affec|tionate &s;on would pay a tender father, he &s;upported his venerable friend whenever he attempted to walk, attend|ed him in all the excur&s;ions he made about his domain, read to him when he wanted to be lulled to &s;leep, and lis|tened, without betraying any &s;ymptoms of fatigue, to his long, and often truly tire&s;ome &s;tories of former battles and campaigns; in paying the&s;e attentions O&s;car obeyed the dictates of gratitude and e&s;teem, and al&s;o gratified a benevolent di&s;po&s;ition, happy in being able
<Q><L>To rock the cradle of declining age.</L></Q></P>
<P>But his time was not &s;o entirely engro&s;&s;ed by the gen|eral as to prevent his having many hours to devote to Adela; with her he alternately conver&s;ed, read, and &s;ung, rambled with her though romantic paths, or rode a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ong the beautiful borders of Lough Erne, was almo&s;t her con&s;tant e&s;cort to all the parties &s;he went to in the neighbourhood, and frequently accompanied her to the hovels of wretchedne&s;s, where the woes which extorted the &s;oft tear of commi&s;eration he &s;aw amply relieved by her generous hand; admiring her as he did before, how impo&s;&s;ible was it for O&s;car, in tho&s;e dangerous tete-a-tetes, to re&s;i&s;t the progre&s;s of a tender pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;a pa&s;&s;i|on, however, confined (as far at lea&s;t as &s;ilence could confine it) to his own heart. The confidence which he thought the general repo&s;ed in him, by allowing &s;uch an intercour&s;e with his daughter, was too &s;acred in his e&s;ti|mation to be abu&s;ed, but though honour re&s;i&s;ted, his health yielded to his feelings.</P>
<P>Adela, from delighting in company, &s;uddenly took a pen&s;ive turn; &s;he declined the con&s;tant &s;ociety &s;he had hither to kept up, and &s;eemed in a &s;olitary ramble with O&s;car to enjoy more plea&s;ure than the gaye&s;t party ap|peared to afford her, the favourite &s;pot they vi&s;ited almo&s;t every evening, was a path on the margin of the lake, at the foot of a woody mountain; here often &s;eated, they viewed the &s;un &s;inking behind the oppo&s;ite hills, and while they enjoyed the benignancy of his departing

beams, beheld him tinge the trembling waves with gold and purple; the low whi&s;tle of the ploughman returning to his humble cottage, the plaintive coral of birds from the adjacent grove, and the low bleating of cattle from pa&s;tures which &s;welled above the water, all the&s;e, by giv|ing the &s;oftne&s;s and mo&s;t plea&s;ing charms of nature to the hour, contrived to touch yet more &s;en&s;ibly, hearts alrea|dy prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in favour of each other. Adela would &s;ometimes &s;ing a little &s;imple air, and carele&s;&s;ly leaning on the arm of O&s;car, appear to enjoy perfect felicity; not &s;o poor O&s;car, the feelings of his &s;oul at the&s;e mo|ments trembled on his lips, and to repre&s;s them was great agony.</P>
<P>An incident &s;oon occurred which endeared him yet more to the General; driving one day in a low phaeton along a road cut over a mountain, the hor&s;es, frighten|ed by a &s;udden firing from the lake, began rearing in a mo&s;t frightful manner; the carriage &s;tood near a tre|mendous precipice, and the &s;ervants, appalled by terror, had not power to move. O&s;car &s;aw that nothing but an effort of de&s;perate re&s;olution could keep them from de|&s;truction, he leaped out, and ru&s;hing before the hor&s;es, &s;eized their heads at the imminent hazard of being tum|bled down the precipice, on who&s;e very verge he &s;tood; the &s;ervants, a little relieved from their terror, ha&s;tened to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the traces were cut, and the poor Ge|neral, who&s;e infirmities had weakened his &s;pirits, con|veyed home in almo&s;t a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility. Adela, perceiving him from her dre&s;&s;ing room window, flew down, and, learned his danger, fell upon his neck in an agony of mingled joy and terror; her care&s;&s;es &s;oon revived him, and as he returned them, his eyes eagerly &s;ought his deliverer. O&s;car &s;tood near, with mingled tenderne&s;s and anxiety in his looks, the General took his hand, and whil&s;t he pre&s;&s;ed it along with Adela's to his bo&s;om, tears fell on them.&mdash;"You are both my chil|dren!" he exclaimed; "the children of my love, and from your felicity I mu&s;t derive mine." This expre&s;|&s;ion O&s;car conceived to be a mere effu&s;ion of gratitude,
<PB N="126" REF="038416_0125_1011E24ED8C06918">
little thinking what a project relative to him had entered the general's head, who had fir&s;t, however, con&s;ulted and learned from his daughter it would be agreeable to her. This generous, &s;ome will &s;ay romantic, old man, felt for O&s;car the mo&s;t unbounded love and gratitude, and as the be&s;t proof of this he re&s;olved to be&s;tow on this young &s;oldier his rich and lovely heire&s;s, who had acknowledged to her father her predilection for him. He knew both his birth to be noble, his di&s;po&s;ition amia|ble, and his &s;pirit brave; be&s;ides, by this union he &s;hould &s;ecure the &s;ociety of Adela; he wi&s;hed her married, yet dreaded, whenever that event took place, he &s;hould be deprived of her, but O&s;car, he &s;uppo&s;ed, bound to him by gratitude, would, unlike others, accede to his wi&s;hes of re&s;iding at Woodlawn during his lifetime; his project he re&s;olved on communicating to Colonel Bel|grave, whom, on O&s;car's account he regarded, as O&s;|car had &s;aid (what indeed he believed) that he was partly indebted to him for his commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>What a thunder &s;troke was this to Belgrave, who ar|rived at Woodlawn the morning after the re&s;olution was finally &s;ettled, and was a&s;ked to accompany the General, about a little bu&s;ine&s;s, to the &s;ummer hou&s;e in the gar|den; poor O&s;car trembled, he felt a pre&s;entiment he &s;hould be the &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e, and had no doubt but the General meant to complain to colonel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">elgrave, as a per&s;on who had &s;ome authority over him, about his great particularity to Mi&s;s Honeywood.</P>
<P>Rage, envy, and &s;urpri&s;e, kept the Colonel &s;ilent &s;ome minutes after the General had ended &s;peaking, di&s;&s;imu|lation then came to his aid, and he attempted, though in faltering accents, to expre&s;s his admiration of &s;uch gene|ro&s;ity, yet to be&s;tow &s;uch a trea&s;ure, &s;o ine&s;timable, on &s;uch a man, when &s;o many of equal rank and fortune &s;ighed for its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; upon a man too, or rather a boy, from who&s;e age it might be expected his affections would be variable. "Let me tell you Colonel," &s;aid the Gene|ral, ha&s;tily interrupting him, and &s;triking his &s;tick upon the ground, as he ro&s;e to return to the hou&s;e, "there can be little danger of his affections changing when &s;uch

<P>The gloom and embarra&s;&s;ment which appeared in the countenance of the Colonel, filled O&s;car with alarms, he imagined them excited by friend&s;hip for him; after what the General had &s;aid, he &s;ighed to hear particular <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and longed for the fir&s;t time, to quit Woodlawn. The Colonel was indeed in a &s;tate of torture; he had long meditated the conque&s;t of Adela, who&s;e fortune and beauty rendered her a truly de&s;irable object, to re&s;ign her without one effort of circumventing O&s;car, was not to be thought of, to bla&s;t his promi&s;ed joys, even if it did not lead to the accompli&s;hment of his own wi&s;hes, he felt would give him &s;ome comfort, and he re&s;olved to leave no means untried for &s;o doing.</P>
<P>They &s;et off early in the morning for Enni&s;kellen, and Belgrave &s;ent his &s;ervant on before them, that there might be no re&s;traint on the conver&s;ation he found O&s;car inclined to begin.</P>

<P>"WELL, Colonel," &s;aid O&s;car, "I fancy I was not mi&s;taken in thinking the General wanted to &s;peak with you concerning me, I am convinced you will not conceal any particulars of a conver&s;ation it may be &s;o e&s;&s;ential to my honour to hear." "Why, faith," cried the Colonel, delighted to commence his operations, "he was making a kind of complaint about you, though he acknowledges you a brave lad, yet hang him, he has not genero&s;ity enough to reward that bravery with his daughter, or any of his trea&s;ure." "Heaven is my witne&s;s!" exclaimed the un&s;u&s;picious O&s;car, "I never a&s;pired to either; I always knew my pa&s;&s;ion for his daughter as hopele&s;s as fervent, and my e&s;teem for him as di&s;intere&s;ted as &s;incere; I would have &s;ooner died than abu&s;ed the confidence he repo&s;ed in me by revealing my attachment; I &s;ee, however, in future I mu&s;t be an ex|ile to Woodlawn." "Not &s;o, neither," replied the Colonel, "only avoid &s;uch particularity to the girl: I believe in my &s;oul &s;he has more pride than &s;u&s;ceptibility in her nature; in your next vi&s;it, therefore, which for that purpo&s;e I would have you &s;oon make, declare, in a cavalier manner, your affections were engaged previous to your coming to Ireland, this declaration will &s;et all to rights with the General, he will no longer dread you on his daughter's account, you will be as welcome as ever to Woodlawn, and enjoy, during your continuance in the country, the &s;ociety you have hitherto been ac|cu&s;tomed

to." "No," &s;aid O&s;car, "I cannot a&s;&s;ert &s;o great a fal&s;hood." "How ridiculus," replied the Colonel: "for heaven's &s;ake, my dear boy, drop &s;uch romantic notions; I &s;hould be the la&s;t man in the world to de&s;ire you to invent a fal&s;hood which could injure any one, but no prie&s;t in chri&s;tendom would blame you for this." "And &s;uppo&s;e I venture, what will it do, but bind fa&s;ter round my heart chains already too galling, and de&s;troy in the end all remains of peace."</P>
<P>"Faith, Fitzalan," &s;aid the Colonel, "by the time you have had a few more love affairs with &s;ome of the pretty girls of this kingdom, you will talk no more in this way; con&s;ider (and be not too &s;crupulous) how di&s;|agreeable it will be to re&s;ign the General's friend&s;hip, and the plea&s;ing &s;ociety you enjoyed at Woodlawn; be|&s;ides, it will appear &s;trange to tho&s;e who knew your for|mer intimacy; in honour too you are bound to do as I de&s;ire you, for &s;hould the girl have been imprudent enough to conceive an attachment for you, this will cer|tainly remove it, for pride would not allow its continu|ance after hearing of a favourite rival, and the General will be e&s;&s;entially &s;erved." "My dear Colonel," &s;aid O&s;car, his eyes &s;uddenly &s;parkling, "do you think &s;he has been imprudent enough to conceive a partiality for me?" "I am &s;ure," &s;aid the Colonel, "that is a que&s;|tion I cannot po&s;itively an&s;wer; but to give my opini|on, I think from her gay, unembarra&s;&s;ed manner, &s;he has not." "I &s;uppo&s;e not, indeed," cried O&s;car, mournfully &s;ighing, "why then &s;hould I be guilty of a fal&s;hood for a per&s;on who is already indifferent to me." "I have told you my rea&s;on," replied the Colonel cold|ly, "do as you plea&s;e." They were now both &s;ilent, but the conver&s;ation was &s;oon renewed, and many argu|ments pa&s;&s;ed on both &s;ides. O&s;car's heart &s;ecretly fa|voured the Colonel's plan, as it promi&s;ed the indulgence of Adela's &s;ociety; to be an exile from Woodlawn was in&s;upportable to his thoughts, rea&s;on yielded to the ve|hemence of pa&s;&s;ion, and he at la&s;t fell into the &s;nare the perfidious Belgrave had &s;pread, thus, by a deviation

<P>Oh! never let the child of integrity be &s;educed from the plain and undeviating path of &s;incerity; oh! never let him hope by illicit means to attain a real plea&s;ure, the hope of obtaining any good through &s;uch means will, like a meteor of the night, allure but to deceive.</P>
<P>Soon after his fatal promi&s;e to the Colonel, a &s;elf|devoted victim, he accompanied him to Woodlawn, on their arrival Mi&s;s Honeywood was in the garden, and O&s;car trembling went to &s;eek her, he found her &s;itting in a flower-woven arbour,
<Q><L>Her&s;elf the faire&s;t flower.</L></Q></P>
<P>Never had &s;he looked more lovely, the natural bloom of her cheeks was heightened by the heat, and glowed beneath the carele&s;s curls that fell over them, and her eyes, the moment &s;he beheld O&s;car, beamed with the &s;ofte&s;t tenderne&s;s, the mo&s;t bewitching &s;en&s;ibility. "My dear! dear Fitzalan!" cried &s;he, throwing a&s;ide the book &s;he had been reading, and extending her hand, "I am glad to &s;ee you, I hope you are come to take up your re&s;idence for &s;ome time at Woodlawn." "You hope," repeated O&s;car mournfully. "I do indeed! but ble&s;s me what is the matter, you are &s;o pale and thin, you look but the &s;hadow of your&s;elf, or rather like a de&s;pairing &s;hepherd, ready to hang him&s;elf, on the fir&s;t willow tree he meets." "I am indeed unhappy! cried O&s;car, "Nor will you wonder at my being &s;o when I acknow|ledge, I at this pre&s;ent time feel a pa&s;&s;ion which I mu&s;t believe hopele&s;s." "Hopele&s;s! well now I in&s;i&s;t on being your confidant, and then (&s;miling &s;omewhat archly) I &s;hall &s;ee what rea&s;on you have to de&s;pair." "Agreed," exclaimed O&s;car; "and now to my &s;tory," then pau&s;ing a minute, he &s;tarted up "no," continued he, "I find it impo&s;&s;ible to tell it&mdash;let this dear, this e&s;timable ob|ject, drawing a miniature of his &s;i&s;ter from his bo&s;om, &s;peak for me, and declare, whether he who loves &s;uch a being can ever lo&s;e that love, or help being wretched at knowing it is without hope." Adela &s;natched it ha&s;tily

from him, and by a &s;udden &s;tart betrayed her &s;urpri&s;e; words indeed are inadequate to expre&s;s her heart-rending emotions as &s;he contemplated the beautiful countenance of her imaginary rival; and was O&s;car then&mdash;that O&s;car whom &s;he adored&mdash;who&s;e happine&s;s &s;he had hoped to con&s;titute&mdash;who&s;e fortune &s;he delighted to think &s;he &s;hould advance&mdash;really attached to another; alas! too true he was&mdash;of the attachment &s;he held a convincing proof in her hand; &s;he examined it again and again, and in its mild beauties thought &s;he beheld a &s;triking proof of the &s;uperiority over the charms &s;he her&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; the ro&s;es for&s;ook her cheeks, a mi&s;t over&s;pread her eyes, and with a &s;hivering horror &s;he dropped it from her hand. O&s;car had quitted the arbour to conceal his agonies. "Well," &s;aid he, now returning, with forced calmne&s;s, "is it not worthy of in&s;piring the pa&s;&s;ion I feel?" Una|ble to an&s;wer him, &s;he could only point to the place where it lay, and ha&s;tened to the hou&s;e.

Adela, on reaching the parlour which opened into the garden, found her father there: "Ah! you lit|tle baggage, do I not de&s;erve a ki&s;s for not di&s;turbing your tete-a tete? Where is that young rogue, Fitza|lan?" "I beg, I entreat, Sir," &s;aid Adela, who&s;e tears could no longer be re&s;trained, "you will never mention him again to me, too much has already been &s;aid about him." "Nay, pr'ythe, my little girl," exclaimed the General, regarding her with &s;urpri&s;e, "cea&s;e thy &s;ighs and tears, and tell me what's the matter." "I am hurt," replied &s;he, in a voice &s;carcely articulate, "that &s;o much has been &s;aid about Mr. Fitzalan, who I can never regard in any other light than that of a common acquaintance." The Colonel, who had purpo&s;ely lin|gered about the wood, now entered. Adela &s;tarted, and precipitately retreated through another door:&mdash;"Faith, my dear Colonel," &s;aid the general, "I am

"It fills a ration|al mind with regret," exclaimed the Colonel, &s;eating him&s;elf gravely, and inwardly rejoicing at the &s;ucce&s;s of his &s;tratagem, "to find &s;uch a fatality prevalent among mankind, as makes them reject a proffered good and &s;igh for that which is unattainable: like wayward children neglecting their &s;ports to pur&s;ue a rainbow, and weeping as the airy pageant mocks their gra&s;p." "Very true, indeed," &s;aid the General, "very excel|lent upon my word; I doubt if the chaplain of a regi|ment ever delivered &s;uch a pretty piece of morality; but dear Colonel," laying his hand on his knee, "what did the boy &s;ay?" "I am &s;orry, Sir," he replied, that what I have ju&s;t &s;aid is &s;o applicable to him; he ac|knowledged the lady's merit, extolled her genero&s;ity, but pleaded a prior attachment again&s;t accepting your offer, which even one more exalted would not tempt him to forego, though he knows not whether he will ever &s;ucceed in it." "The devil he did!" exclaimed the General, as &s;oon as rage and &s;urpri&s;e would allow him to &s;peak, the little impertinent puppy! the ungrateful young dog! a prior attachment&mdash;reject my girl&mdash;my Adela&mdash;who has had &s;uch &s;uitors already: &s;o, I &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hall have the whole affair blazed about the country; I &s;hall hear from every quarter how my daughter was re|fu&s;ed, and by whom?&mdash;why, by a little En&s;ign, who&s;e whole fortune lies in his &s;word knot&mdash;A fine game I have played, truly; but if the jackanapes opens his lips about the matter, may powder be my poi&s;on if I do not trim his jacket for him!" "Dear General," &s;aid the Colonel, "you may depend on his honour, but even &s;up|po&s;ing he did mention the affair, &s;urely you &s;hould know it would not be in his power to injure Mi&s;s Honeywood&mdash;amiable&mdash;accompli&s;hed&mdash;in &s;hort, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, as &s;he is, of every perfection, I know men, at lea&s;t one man, of con&s;equence, both from birth and fortune, who has long &s;ighed for her, and who would, if he received the lea&s;t

<P>O&s;car and Adela did not appear till dinner time, both had been endeavouring to regain compo&s;ure, but poor O&s;car, had been far le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful then Adela, in the at|tempt; not that &s;he loved le&s;s, for indeed her pa&s;&s;ion for him was of the tendere&s;t nature, and &s;he flattered her&s;elf with having in&s;pired one equally ardent in his brea&s;t; &s;anctioned by her father, &s;he thought it would con&s;titute the felicity of their lives, and looked forward with a generous delight to the period when &s;he &s;hould render her beloved Fitzalan pro&s;perous and independent: the di&s;appointment &s;he experienced, as the fir&s;t &s;he had ever met, &s;at heavy on her heart, and the gay vi&s;ions of youth were in a moment clouded by melancholy; but her pride was as great as her &s;en&s;ibility, and as its pow|erful impul&s;e pervaded her mind, &s;he re&s;olved to afford O&s;car no triumph by letting him witne&s;s her dejection, &s;he therefore wiped away all traces of tears from her eyes, checked the vain &s;igh that &s;truggled at her heart, and dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf with as much attention as ever; her heavy eyes, her colourle&s;s cheeks, however, denoted her feelings; &s;he tried, as &s;he &s;at at table, to appear cheerful, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> vain, and on the removal of the cloth immediately retired, as no ladies were pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The general was a &s;tranger to di&s;&s;imulation, and as he had no longer felt, he no longer treated O&s;car with u&s;ual kindne&s;s; when pale, trembling, and di&s;ordered, he appeared before him, he received him with a &s;tern frown, an air &s;carcely complai&s;ant; this increa&s;ed the agitation of O&s;car, every feeling of his &s;oul was in com|motion he was no longer the life of the company, their happine&s;s and mirth formed a &s;triking contra&s;t to his mi&s;ery and dejection, he felt a forlorn wretch, a mere child of &s;orrow and dependence; &s;calding tears drop|ped from him a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> he be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t over his plate, he could have cur&s;ed him&s;elf for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> weakne&s;s, fortunately it was un|noticed;

noticed; in lo&s;ing the general's attention he &s;eemed to lo&s;e that of his gue&s;ts, his &s;ituation grew too irk&s;ome to be borne, he ro&s;e unregarded, and a &s;ecret impul&s;e led him to the drawing room. Here Adela oppre&s;&s;ed by the dejection of her &s;pirits, had flung her&s;elf upon a couch, and gradually &s;unk into a &s;lumber: O&s;car &s;tep|ped lightly forward and gazed on her with a tenderne&s;s as exqui&s;ite as a mother would have felt in viewing her &s;leeping babe; her cheek, which re&s;ted on her fair hand, was tinged with a blu&s;h, by the reflection of a crim&s;on curtain through which the &s;un darted, and the traces of a tear was yet di&s;cernable upon it. "Never!" cried O&s;car, with folded hands, as he hung over the intere&s;t|ing figure, "never may any tear, except that of &s;oft &s;en&s;ibility for the woes of others, bedew the cheek of Adela&mdash;perfect as her goodne&s;s be her felicity&mdash;may every ble&s;&s;ing &s;he now enjoys be rendered permanent by that power who &s;miles benignly upon innocence like hers.&mdash;Oh!

Adela began to &s;tir, &s;he murmured out &s;ome inarticulate words, and, &s;uddenly ri&s;ing from the couch, beheld the motionle&s;s form of Fitzalan; haughtily regarding him, &s;he a&s;ked the mean|ing of &s;uch an intru&s;ion. "I did not mean indeed to intrude," "&s;aid he, "but when I came and found you, can you wonder at my being fa&s;cinated to the &s;pot?" The plaintive tone of his voice &s;unk deep into Adela's heart, &s;he &s;ighed heavily, and turning away &s;eated her|&s;elf in a window. O&s;car followed; he forgot the cha|racter he had a&s;&s;umed in the morning, and gently &s;eiz|ing her hand, pre&s;&s;ed it to his bo&s;om; at this critical minute, when mutual &s;ympathy appeared on the point of triumphing over duplicity, the door opened, and Colonel Belgrave appeared; from the in&s;tant of O&s;car's departure he had been on thorns to follow him, fearful of the con&s;equences of a tete-a-tete, and was attended by the re&s;t of the gentlemen.</P>

O&s;car was determined on not &s;taying another night at Woodlawn, and declared his intention by a&s;king Colonel Belgrave if he had any commands for Enni&s;kellen, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|ther he meant to return immediately.

The twittering of the birds rou&s;ed him from an unea&s;y &s;lumber, or rather lethargy, into which he had fallen, and &s;tarting up, he ha&s;tened to the road, fearful, as day was beginning to dawn, of being &s;een by any of General Ho|neywood's workmen: it was late ere he arrived at En|ni&s;kellen, and before he gained his room he was met by &s;ome of the officers, who viewed him with evident a&s;to|ni&s;hment; his regimentals were quite &s;poiled, his fine hair, from which the rain had wa&s;hed all the powder, hung di&s;hevelled about his &s;houlders, the feather of his hat was broken, and the di&s;order of his countenance was not le&s;s &s;u&s;picious than that of his dre&s;s; to their inqui|ries he &s;tammered out &s;omething of a fall, and extricated him&s;elf with difficulty from them.</P>
<P>In an ob&s;cure village, fifteen miles from Enni&s;kellen, a detachment of the regiment lay, the officer who com|manded it di&s;liked his &s;ituation extrmely, but company being irk&s;ome to O&s;car it was ju&s;t &s;uch a one as he de|&s;ired, and he obtained leave to relieve him; the agitation of his mind aided by the affects of the &s;torm he had been expo&s;ed to, was too much for his con&s;titution: immedi|ately on arriving at his new quarters he was &s;eized with a violent fever, an officer was obliged to be &s;ent to do duty in his place, and it was long ere any &s;ymptom ap|peared which could flatter tho&s;e who attended him with hopes of recovery; when able to &s;it up he was ordered to return to Enni&s;kellen, where he could be immediate|ly under the care of the regimental &s;urgeon.</P>
<P>O&s;car's &s;ervant accompanied him in the carriage, and as it drove &s;lowly along he was agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed by a view of Mrs. Marlowe's orchard, he could not re&s;i&s;t the wi&s;h of &s;eeing her and making inquiries relative to the inhabitants of Woodlawn: for with Mrs. Marlowe, I &s;hould previou&s;ly &s;ay, he had not only formed an intima|cy, but a &s;incere friend&s;hip; &s;he was a woman of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing manners, and to her &s;uperintending care Adela was indebted for many of the graces &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed

<P>The evening was far advanced when O&s;car reached the orchard, and leaning on his &s;ervant &s;lowly walked up the hill; had a &s;pectre appeared before the old lady &s;he could not have &s;eemed more &s;hocked than &s;he now did at the unexpected and emaciated appearance of her young friend&mdash;with all the tenderne&s;s of a fond mother, &s;he pre&s;&s;ed his cold hands between her own, and &s;eated him by the cheerful fire which blazed on her hearth, then procured him refre&s;hments that, joined to her conver&s;a|tion, a little revied his &s;pirits; yet, at this moment the recollection of the fir&s;t interview he ever had with her, recurred with pain to his heart: "our friends at Wood|lawn I hope&mdash;" cried he, he pau&s;ed&mdash;but his eyes ex|pre&s;&s;ed the inquiry his tongue was unable to make.&mdash;"They are well and happy," replied Mrs. Marlowe, "and you know, I &s;uppo&s;e, of all that has lately happen|ed there." "No, I know nothing. I am as one awoke from the &s;lumbers of the grave." "Ere I inform you then," cried Mrs. Marlowe, "let me, my noble O&s;car, expre&s;s my approbation, my admiration, of your conduct, of that di&s;intere&s;ted nature which preferred the pre&s;erva|tion of con&s;tancy to the &s;plendid independency offered to your acceptance." "What &s;plendid independency did I refu&s;e?" a&s;ked O&s;car, wildly &s;taring at her. "That which the General offered." "The General!" "Yes, and appointed Colonel Belgrave to declare his inten|tions." "Oh heavens!" exclaimed O&s;car &s;tarting from his chair, "did the General indeed form &s;uch intentions, and has Belgrave then deceived me, he told me my atten|tions to Mi&s;s Honeywood were noticed and di&s;liked&mdash;he filled my &s;oul with unutterable angui&s;h, and per&s;uaded me to a fal&s;hood which has plunged me into de&s;pair!" "He is a mon&s;ter," cried Mrs. Marlowe, "and you are a victim to his treachery." "Oh no! I will fly to the General and open my whole &s;oul to him, at his feet I will declare the fal&s;e ideas of honor which mi&s;led me, I &s;hall obtain his forgivene&s;s, and Adela will yet be mine." "Alas! my child," &s;aid Mrs. Marlowe, &s;topping him
<PB N="139" REF="038416_0138_1011E26EA891F4B0">
as he was hurrying from the room, "it is now too late, Adela can never be yours, &s;he is married, and married unto Belgrave." O&s;car &s;taggered back a few paces, ut|tered a deep groan, and fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s at her feet. Mrs. Marlowe's cries brought in his &s;ervant as well as her own to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he was laid upon a bed, but it was long ere he &s;hewed any &s;igns of recovery; at length opening his heavy eyes, he &s;ighed deeply, and exclaimed, "&s;he is lo&s;t to me for ever!"</P>
<P>The &s;ervants were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed and the tender hearted Mrs. Marlowe knelt be&s;ide him. "Oh! my friend," &s;aid &s;he, "my heart &s;ympathizes in your &s;orrow, but 'tis from your own fortitude, more than my &s;ympathy, you mu&s;t now derive re&s;ources of &s;upport." "Oh hor|rible! to know the cup of happine&s;s was at my lips, and that it was my own hand da&s;hed it from me." "Such, alas!" &s;aid Mrs. Marlowe, &s;ighing as if touched at the moment with a &s;imilar pang of &s;elf regret, "is the waywardne&s;s of mortals; too often do they deprive them&s;elves of the ble&s;&s;ings of a bounteous providence by their own folly and imprudence&mdash;oh! my friend, born as you were, with a noble ingenuity of &s;oul, never let that &s;oul again be &s;ullied by the &s;malle&s;t deviation from &s;incerity." "Do not aggravate my &s;ufferings," &s;aid O&s;car, "by dwelling on my error." "No&mdash;I would &s;ooner die than be guil|ty of &s;uch barbarity; but admonition never &s;inks &s;o deeply on the heart as in the hour of trial; young, ami|able as you are, life teems, I doubt not, with various ble&s;&s;ings for you&mdash;ble&s;&s;ings which you will know how to value properly, for early di&s;appointment is the nur&s;e of wi&s;dom." "Alas!" exclaimed he, "what ble&s;|&s;ings&punc;" "Tho&s;e at lea&s;t," cried Mrs. Marlowe, "are in your power, the peace, the happine&s;s, which ever proceeds from a mind con&s;cious of having di&s;charged the incumbent duties of life, and patiently &s;ubmitted to its trials." "But do you think I will calmly &s;ubmit to his ba&s;ene&s;s?" &s;aid O&s;car, interrupting her, "No! Belgrave &s;hall never triumph over me with impunity!" He &s;tarted from the bed, and ru&s;hing into the outer room, &s;natched <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;word from the table on which he
<PB N="140" REF="038416_0139_1011E270DE356600">
had flung it at his entrance: Mrs. Marlowe caught his arm, "ra&s;h young man!" exclaimed &s;he, "whither would you go&mdash;is it to &s;catter ruin and de&s;olation around you? Suppo&s;e your vengeance was gratified, would that re|&s;tore your happine&s;s? Think you that Adela, the child of virtue and propriety, would ever notice the murderer of her hu&s;band, how unworthy &s;oever that hu&s;band may be&punc; or that the old general, who &s;o fon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> planned your felicity, would forgive, if he could &s;urvive the evils of his hou&s;e occa&s;ioned by you?" the &s;word dropped from the trembling hand of O&s;car: "I have been blamea|ble," cried he, in allowing my&s;elf to be tran&s;ported to &s;uch an effort of revenge; I forgot every thing but that, and as to my own life, deprived of Adela, it ap|pears &s;o gloomy as to be &s;carcely worth pre&s;erving."</P>
<P>Mrs. Marlowe &s;eized this moment of yielding &s;oft|ne&s;s to advi&s;e and rea&s;on with him, her tears mingled with his, as &s;he li&s;tened to his relation of Belgrave's perfidy; tears augmented by reflecting, that Adela, the darling of her care and her affections, was al&s;o a victim to it; &s;he convinced O&s;car, however, that it would be prudent to confine the fatal &s;ecret to their own brea&s;ts; the agitation of his mind was too much for the weak &s;tate of his health, the fever returned and he felt unable to quit the cottage: Mrs. Marlowe prepared a bed for him, tru&s;ting he would &s;oon be able to remove, but &s;he was di&s;appointed, it was long ere O&s;car could quit the bed of &s;ickne&s;s: &s;he watched over him with ma|ternal tenderne&s;s, while he like a bla&s;ted flower, &s;eem|ed ha&s;tening to decay.</P>
<P>The General was &s;tung to the &s;oul by the rejection of his offer, which he thought would have in&s;pired the &s;oul of O&s;car with rapture and gratitude; never had his pride been &s;o &s;everely wounded, never before had he felt humbled in his own eyes: his mortifying reflections the Colonel &s;oon found means to remove, by the mo&s;t delicate flattery and the mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous attention, a&s;&s;ur|ing the general that his conduct merited not the cen&s;ure, but the applau&s;e of the world: the &s;ophi&s;try which can reconcile us to our&s;elves is truly plea&s;ing, the colonel

gradually became a favourite, and when he in&s;inuated his attachment for Adela, was a&s;&s;ured he &s;hould have all the General's intere&s;t with her; he was now more anxi|ous than ever to have her advantageou&s;ly &s;ettled, there was &s;omething &s;o humiliating in the idea of her being rejected, that it drove him at times almo&s;t to madne&s;s: the colonel po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the advantages of fortune, but the&s;e weighed little in his favor with the general, (who&s;e notions we have already proved very di&s;intere&s;ted) and much le&s;s with his daughter; on the fir&s;t overture about him &s;he reque&s;ted the &s;ubject might be entirely dropped, the mention of love was extremely painful to her; wound|ed by her di&s;appointment, in the &s;evere&s;t manner, her heart required time to heal it, her feelings delicacy con|fined to her own bo&s;om, but her languid eyes and &s;ad|ed cheeks, denoted their poignancy; &s;he avoided compa|ny, and was perpetually wandering through the roman|tic and &s;olitary paths which &s;he and O&s;car had trod toge|ther; here more than ever &s;he thought of him, and feared &s;he had treated her poor companion unkindly, &s;he &s;aw him oppre&s;&s;ed with &s;adne&s;s, and yet &s;he had driven him from her by the repul&s;ive coldne&s;s of her manner; a manner too, which, from its being &s;o &s;uddenly a&s;&s;umed, could not fail of conveying an idea of her di&s;appointment; this hurt her delicacy as much as her tenderne&s;s, and &s;he would have given worlds, had &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them, to recall the time when &s;he could have afforded con&s;ola|tion to O&s;car, and convinced him, that &s;olely as a friend &s;he regarded him. The colonel was not di&s;couraged by her coldne&s;s&mdash;he was in the habit of conquering dif|ficulties, and doubted not he &s;hould overcome any &s;he threw in his way; he &s;ometimes, as if by chance, contri|ved to meet her in her rambles, his conver&s;ation was always amu&s;ing, and confined within the limits &s;he had pre&s;cribed, but his eyes, by the tendere&s;t expre&s;&s;ion, de|clared the pain he &s;uffered from this pre&s;cription, and &s;ecretly plea&s;ed Adela, as it convinced her of the impli|cit deference he paid to her will.</P>
<P>Some weeks had elap&s;ed &s;ince O&s;car's voluntary exile from Woodlawn, and &s;anguine as were the colonel's

hopes, he found without a &s;tratagem they would not be realized (at lea&s;t as &s;oon as he expected): fertile in in|vention, he was not long in concerting one; he followed Adela one morning into the garden, and &s;ound her reading in the arbour; &s;he laid a&s;ide the book at his en|trance, and they chatted for &s;ome time on indifferent &s;ubjects; the colonel's &s;ervant at la&s;t appeared with a large pacquet of letters, which he pre&s;ented to his ma&s;|ter, who, with an he&s;itating air, was about putting them into his pocket, when Adela prevented him; "make no ceremony colonel," &s;aid &s;he, "with me, I &s;hall re&s;ume my book till you have peru&s;ed your letters; the colonel bowed for her permi&s;&s;ion, and began: her attention was &s;oon drawn from her book by the &s;udden emotion he betrayed&mdash;he &s;tarted, and exclaimed, "Oh heavens! what a wretch!" then&punc; as if &s;uddenly recol|lecting his &s;ituation, looked at Adela, appeared confu&s;|ed, &s;tammered out a few inarticulate words, and re&s;u|med his letter; when fini&s;hed, he &s;eemed to put it into his pocket, but in reality dropped it at his feet for the ba&s;e&s;t purpo&s;e; he ran over the remainder of the let|ters, and ri&s;ing, entreated Adela to excu&s;e his leaving her &s;o abruptly, to an&s;wer &s;ome of them; &s;oon after his departure Adela perceived an open letter lying at her feet, &s;he immediately took it up with an intention of re|turning to the hou&s;e with it, when the &s;ight of her own name, in capital letters, and the well known hand of Fitzalan, &s;truck her &s;ight, &s;he threw the letter on a table, an univer&s;al; tremor &s;eized her, &s;he would have given any con&s;ideration to know why &s;he was mention|ed in a corre&s;pondence between Belgrave and Fitzalan, her eye involuntarily glanced at the letter, &s;he &s;aw &s;ome words in it which excited &s;till more &s;trongly her curio|&s;ity, it could no longer be repre&s;&s;ed, &s;he &s;natched it up, and read as follows:</P>

I merit, but why, becau&s;e, I have been too &s;u&s;ceptible to tho&s;e of another, which, in the fond e&s;timation of a lover, (at lea&s;t) appear infinitely &s;uperior. The General's offer was certainly a mo&s;t generous and flattering one, and has gratified every feeling of my &s;oul, by giving me an op|portunity of &s;acrificing at the &s;hrine of love, ambition, and &s;elf-inter&s;t; my di&s;intere&s;ted conduct has confirmed me in the affections of my dear girl, who&s;e vanity I can|not help thinking a little elevated by the triumph I have told her &s;he obtained over Adela; but this is excu&s;able indeed when we con&s;ider the object I relinqui&s;hed for her.

<P>"Wretch!" cried the agitated Adela, dropping the letter (which it is &s;carce nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay was an infa|mous forgery) in an agony of greif and indignation, "is this the ba&s;e return we meet for our wi&s;hes to rai&s;e you to pro&s;perity; oh! cruel Fitzalan, is it Adela, who thought you &s;o amiable, and who never thoroughly valu|ed wealth till &s;he believed it had given her the power of conducing to your felicity, whom you hold up as an object of ridicule, for unfeeling vanity to triumph over." Wounded pride and tenderne&s;s rai&s;ed a whirl of contend|ing pa&s;&s;ions in her brea&s;t, &s;he &s;unk upon the bench, her head re&s;ted on her hand, and &s;ighs, and tears bur&s;t from her: &s;he now re&s;olved to inform Fitzalan &s;he knew the ba&s;ene&s;s of his conduct, and &s;ting his heart with keen reproaches, now re&s;olved to pa&s;s it over in &s;ilent con|tempt; while thus fluctuating the Colonel &s;oftly advanc|ed

and &s;tood before her, in the tumult of her mind &s;he had quite forgot the probability of his returning, and involuntarily &s;creamed and &s;tarted at his appearance; by her confu&s;ion &s;he doubted not but he would &s;u&s;pect her of having peru&s;ed the fatal letter; oppre&s;&s;ed by the idea, her head &s;unk on her bo&s;om, and her face was co|vered with blu&s;hes. "What a carele&s;s fellow I am," &s;aid the Colonel, taking up the letter, which he then pretended to perceive, he glanced at Adela, "cur&s;e it!" continued he, "I would rather have had all the letters read than this one." He &s;u&s;pects me, thought Adela, her blu&s;hes faded, and &s;he fell back on her &s;eat, unable to &s;upport the oppre&s;&s;ive idea of having acted again&s;t the rules of propriety. Belgrave flew to &s;upport her, "lovelie&s;t of women," he exclaimed, with all the &s;oft|ne&s;s he could a&s;&s;ume, "what means this agitation?" "I have been &s;uddenly affected," an&s;wered Adela, a little recovering, and ri&s;ing, &s;he motioned to return to the hou&s;e. "Thus," re&s;umed the Cononel, "you always fly me, but go, Mi&s;s Honeywood, I have no right, no at|traction, indeed to detain you, yet, be a&s;&s;ured," and he &s;ummoned a tear to his aid, while he pre&s;&s;ed her hand to his bo&s;om, "a heart more truly devoted to you than mine, you can never meet; but I &s;ee the &s;ubject is pain|ful, and again I re&s;ume the rigid &s;ilence you have impo&s;|ed on me; go then, mo&s;t lovely, and beloved, and &s;ince I dare not a&s;pire to a higher, allow me, at lea&s;t, the title of your friend" "Mo&s;t willingly," &s;aid Adela, penetrat|ed by his gentlene&s;s; &s;he was now tolerably recovered, and he prevailed on her to walk in&s;tead of returning to the hou&s;e: &s;he felt &s;oothed by his attention, his in&s;iduous tongue dropped man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a, he gradually &s;tole her thoughts from painful recollections; the implicit re&s;pect he paid her well flattered her wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nded pride, and her gratitude was excited by knowing he re&s;ented the di&s;re&s;pectful mention of her name in Fitzalan's letter; in &s;hort, &s;he felt e&s;teem and re&s;pect for him, contempt and re&s;ent|ment for O&s;car. The Colonel was too penetrating not to di&s;cover her &s;entiments, and too artful not to take advantage of them; had Adela indeed obeyed the real

feelings of her heart &s;he would have declared again&s;t marrying, but pride urged her to a &s;tep which would prove to Fitzalan his conduct had not affected her; the General rejoiced at obtaining her con&s;ent, and received a promi&s;e that for &s;ome time &s;he &s;hould not be &s;eparated from him. The mo&s;t &s;plendid preparations were made for the nuptials, but though Adela's re&s;entment remain|ed unabated, &s;he &s;oon began to wi&s;h &s;he had not been &s;o precipitate in obeying it, an involuntary repugnance ro&s;e in her mind again&s;t the connection &s;he was about form|ing, and honor alone kept her from declining it for ever. Her beloved friend, Mrs. Marlowe, &s;upported her throughout the trying occa&s;ion, and, in an unau&s;picious hour, Adela gave her hand to the perfidious Belgrave.</P>
<P>About a fortnight after her nuptials &s;he heard from &s;ome of the officers of O&s;car's illne&s;s, &s;he blu&s;hed at his name: "faith" cried one of them, "Mrs. Marlowe is a charming woman, it is well he got into &s;uch &s;nug quar|ters, I really believe el&s;ewhere he would have given up the gho&s;t." "Poor fellow," &s;ighed &s;he heavily, yet with|out being &s;en&s;ible of it. Belgrave ro&s;e, he caught her eyes, a dark frown loured on his brow, and he looked as if he would pierce into the rece&s;&s;es of her heart; &s;he &s;huddered, and, for the fir&s;t time, felt the tyranny &s;he had impo&s;ed upon her&s;elf; as Mrs. Marlowe cho&s;e to be &s;ilent on the &s;ubject, &s;he re&s;olved not to mention it to her, but &s;he &s;ent every day to invite her to Woodlawn, expecting by this to hear &s;omething of O&s;car, but &s;he was di&s;appointed. At the end of a fortnight Mrs. Mar|lowe made her appearance, &s;he looked pale and thin, Adela gently reproved her for her long ab&s;ence, tru&s;ting this would oblige her to alledge the rea&s;on of it, but no &s;uch thing; Mrs. Marlowe began to conver&s;e on indif|ferent &s;ubjects, Adela &s;uddenly grew peevi&s;h, and &s;ullen|ly &s;at at her work.</P>
<P>In a few days after Mrs. Marlowe's vi&s;it, Adela, one evening immediately after dinner ordered the carriage to the Cottage; by this time &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed O&s;car had left it, and flattered her&s;elf in the cour&s;e of conver&s;ation, &s;he

&s;hould learn whether he was perfectly recovered, ere he departed; propo&s;ing to &s;urpri&s;e her friend, &s;he &s;tole by a winding path to the cottage, and &s;oftly opened the par|lour door, but what were her felings when &s;he perceived O&s;car &s;itting at the fire &s;ide with Mrs. Marlowe, en|gaged in a deep conver&s;ation; &s;he &s;topped unable to ad|vance, Mrs. Marlowe embraced and led her forward, the emotions of O&s;car were not inferior to Adela's, he at|tempted to ri&s;e, but could not, a glance from the expre&s;|&s;ive eyes of Mrs Marlowe, which &s;eemed to conjure him not to yield to a weakne&s;s which would betray his real &s;entiments to Adela, &s;omewhat reanimated him, he ro&s;e and tremblingly approached her, "allow, me madam," cried he, "to&mdash;" the &s;entence died unfini&s;hed on his lips, he had not power to offer congratulations on an event which had probably de&s;troyed the happine&s;s of Adela as well as his own. "Oh! a truce with compliments," &s;aid Mrs. Marlowe, forcing her&s;elf to a&s;&s;ume a cheerful air, "prithee good folks, let us be &s;eated, and enjoy, this cold evening, the comforts of a good fire;" &s;he forced the trembling, the almo&s;t fainting, Adela, to take &s;ome wine, and, by degrees, the flutter of her &s;pirits and O&s;car's abated; but the &s;adne&s;s of their countenances, the angui&s;h of their &s;ouls, increa&s;ed the cold formality, the di&s;tant re&s;erve, they both a&s;&s;umed, filled each with &s;orrow and regret; &s;o pale, &s;o emaciated, &s;o woe begone, did Fitzalan appear, &s;o much the &s;on of &s;orrow and de&s;|pair, that had he half murdered Adela, &s;he could not at that moment have felt for him any other &s;entiments than tho&s;e of pity and compa&s;&s;ion. Mrs. Marlowe, in a laughing way, told her of the trouble &s;he had had with him, "for which, I a&s;&s;ure you," &s;aid &s;he, "he rewards me badly, for the moment he was enlarged from the nur|&s;ery, he either forgot or neglected all the rules I had laid down for him, pray do join your commands to mine, and charge him to take more care of him&s;elf." "I would mo&s;t willingly," cried Adela, "if I thought they would influence him to do &s;o." "Influence!" repeated O&s;car emphatically, "oh heavens!" then, &s;tarting up, he hur|ried to the window, as if to hide and to indulge his me|lancholy;
<PB N="147" REF="038416_0146_1011E282157491A8">
the &s;cene he viewed from it was dreary and de&s;olate, it was now the latter end of autumn, the even|ing was cold, a &s;avage bla&s;t howled from the hills, and the &s;ky was darkened by a coming &s;torm. Mrs. Marlowe rou&s;ed him from his reverie, "I am &s;ure," &s;aid &s;he, "the pro&s;pect you view from the window can have no great attractions at pre&s;ent." "And yet," cried he, "there is &s;omething &s;adly plea&s;ing in it, the leafle&s;s trees, the fading flowers of autumn, excite in my bo&s;om a kind of mournful &s;ympathy; they are emblems, to me, of him who&s;e tendere&s;t hopes have been di&s;ap|pointed, but, unlike him, they after a &s;hort period &s;hall again flouri&s;h with primeval beauty." "Non&s;en&s;e!" exclaimed Mrs. Marlowe, "your illne&s;s has affected your &s;pirits, but this gloom will vani&s;h long before my orchard rea&s;&s;umes its &s;miling appearance, and haply at|tracts another &s;mart red coat to vi&s;it an old woman." "Oh! with what an enthu&s;ia&s;m of tenderne&s;s," cried O&s;car, "&s;hall I ever remember the dear though danger|ous moment, I fir&s;t entered this cottage." "Now, no flattery, O&s;car," &s;aid Mrs. Marlowe, "I know your fickle &s;ex too well to believe I have made a la&s;ting im|pre&s;&s;ion; why the very fir&s;t fine old woman you meet at your en&s;uing quarters will, I dare &s;ay, have &s;imilar prai&s;e be&s;towed on her." "No," replied he, with a languid &s;mile, "I can a&s;&s;ure you &s;olemnly, the impre&s;&s;ion which had been made on my heart will never be effaced&punc;" He &s;tole a look at Adela, her head &s;unk upon her bo&s;om, and her heart began to beat violently: Mrs. Marlowe wi&s;hed to change the &s;ubject entirely; &s;he felt the true&s;t compa&s;&s;ion for the unhappy young couple, and had fer|vently de&s;ired their union; but &s;ince irrevocably &s;epara|ted, &s;he wi&s;hed to check any intimation of a mutual at|tachment which could now an&s;wer no purpo&s;e but that of increa&s;ing their mi&s;ery; &s;he rung for tea, and endea|voured by her conver&s;ation to enliven the tea-table, the effort, however, was not &s;econded: "You have often," cried &s;he, addre&s;&s;ing Adela, as they again drew their chairs round the fire, "de&s;ired to hear the exact parti|culars of my life, unconquerable feelings of regret hi|therto

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TO begin, then, as they &s;ay in a novel, without further preface, I was the only child of a coun|try curate, in the &s;outhern part of England; who, like his wife, was of a good but reduced family&punc; contented di&s;po&s;itions and an agreeable neighbourhood, ready on every occa&s;ion to oblige them, rendered them, in their humble &s;ituation, completely happy. I was the idol of both their hearts&mdash;every one told my mother I &s;hould grow up a beauty, and &s;he, poor &s;imple woman believ|ed the flattering tale; naturally ambitious, and &s;ome|what romantic, &s;he expected nothing le&s;s than my at|taining by my charms, an elevated &s;ituation; to fit me for it, therefore, according to her idea, &s;he gave me all the &s;hewy, in&s;tead of &s;olid, advantages of education; my father being a meek, or rather an indolent man, &s;ub|mitted entirely to her direction: thus, without knowing the grammatical part of my own language, I was taught to gabble bad French by her&s;elf, and, in&s;tead of mend|ing or making my clothes, to flouri&s;h upon catgut and embroider &s;atin; I was taught dancing by a man who kept a cheap &s;chool for that purpo&s;e in the village; mu|&s;ic
<PB N="149" REF="038416_0148_1011E2875FF630A0">
I could not a&s;pire to, my mother's finances being in|&s;ufficient to purcha&s;e an in&s;trument; &s;he was therefore obliged to content her&s;elf with my knowing the vocal part of that delightful &s;cience, and in&s;tructed me in &s;inging a few old fa&s;hioned airs, with a thou&s;and graces, in her opinion at lea&s;t.</P>
<P>To make me excel by my dre&s;s, as well as my accom|pli&s;hments, all the mi&s;&s;es of the village, the remains of her finery were cut and altered into every form which art or ingenuity could &s;ugge&s;t; and, heaven forgive me, but, my chief inducement in going to meeting on Sunday, was to exhibit my flounced &s;ilk petticoat, and painted chip hat.</P>
<P>When I attained my &s;ixteenth year, my mother thought me, (and &s;uppo&s;ed every one el&s;e mu&s;t do the &s;ame) the mo&s;t perfect creature in the world; I was lively and thoughtle&s;s, vain and ambitious, to an extra|vagant degree, yet, truly innocent in my di&s;po&s;ition, and often forgetting the appearance I had been taught to a&s;&s;ume, indulged the natural gaiety of my heart, in a game of hide and go &s;eek, among&s;t the haycocks in a meadow, by moon light, enjoyed perfect felicity.</P>
<P>Once a week, accompanied by my mother, I attended the dancing ma&s;ter's &s;chool, to practi&s;e country dances; one evening, we had ju&s;t concluded a &s;et, and were re&s;t|ing our&s;elves, when an elegant youth, in a fa&s;hionable riding dre&s;s, entered the room; his appearance at once excited admiration and &s;urpri&s;e, never &s;hall I forget the palpitation of my heart at his approach, every girl expe|rienced the &s;ame, every cheek was flu&s;hed, and every eye &s;parkled with hope and expectation; he walked round the room with an ea&s;y unembarra&s;&s;ed air, as if to take a &s;urvey of the company; he &s;topped by a very pretty girl, the miller's daughter&mdash;good heavens! what were my agonies,&mdash;my mother too, who &s;at be&s;ide me, turn|ed pale, and would actually, I believe, have fainted, had he taken any farther notice of her; fortunately he did not, but advanced, my eyes caught his, he again pau&s;ed, looked &s;urpri&s;ed and plea&s;ed, and after a moment
<PB N="150" REF="038416_0149_1011E289D6DBEDC0">
pa&s;&s;ed in &s;eeming con&s;ideration, bowed with the utmo&s;t elegance, and reque&s;ted the honour of my hand for the en&s;uing dance; my politene&s;s had hitherto only been in theory, I aro&s;e, dropped him a profound courte&s;y, a&s;&s;ur|ed him the honour would be all on my &s;ide, and I was happy to grant his reque&s;t; he &s;miled, I thought, a little archly, and coughed to avoid laughing; I blu&s;hed and felt embarra&s;&s;ed, but he led me to the head of the room to call a dance, and my triumph over my companions &s;o exhilerated my &s;pirits, that I immediately lo&s;t all con|fu&s;ion.</P>
<P>I had been engaged to a young farmer, and he was enraged, not only at my breaking my engagement with|out his permi&s;&s;ion, but at the &s;uperior graces of my partner, who threatened to be a formidable rival to him; "by jingo!" &s;aid Clod, coming up to me in a &s;urly manner, "I think, Mi&s;s Fanny, you have not u&s;ed me genteelly, I don't &s;ee why this here fine &s;park &s;hould take the lead of us all." "Creature!" cried I, with an ineffable look of contempt, which he could not bear, and retired grumbling. My partner could no longer refrain from laughing, the &s;implicity of my man|ners, notwith&s;tanding the airs I endeavoured to a&s;&s;ume, highly delighted him&mdash;"No wonder," cried he, "the poor &s;wain &s;hould be mortified at lo&s;ing the hand of his charming Fanny."</P>
<P>The dancing over, we rejoined my mother, who was on thorns to begin a conver&s;ation with the &s;tranger, that &s;he might let him know we were not to be ranked with the pre&s;ent company; "I am &s;ure, Sir," &s;aid &s;he, "a gentleman of your elegant appearance mu&s;t feel rather aukward in the pre&s;ent party; it is &s;o with us, as indeed it mu&s;t be with every per&s;on of fa&s;hion; but in an ob|&s;cure little village like this, we mu&s;t not be too nice in our &s;ociety, except, like a hermit, we could do without any." The &s;tranger a&s;&s;ented to whatever &s;he &s;aid, and accepted an invitation to &s;up with us; my mother in|&s;tantly &s;ent an intimation of her will to my father, to have, not the fatted calf indeed, but the fatted duck pre|pared; and he and the maid u&s;ed &s;uch expedition, that by
<PB N="151" REF="038416_0150_1011E28C9FC51E20">
the time we returned, a neat, comfortable &s;upper was ready to lay on the table. Mr. Marlowe, the &s;tranger's name, as he informed us, was all animation and affabi|lity; it is unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay that my mother, father, and my&s;elf, were all complai&s;ance, delight and atten|tion; on departing, he a&s;ked and obtained permi&s;&s;ion of cour&s;e to renew his vi&s;it the next day, and my mother immediately &s;et him down as her future &s;on in-law.</P>
<P>As every thing is &s;peedily communicated in &s;uch a &s;mall village as we re&s;ided in, we learned, on the pre|ceding evening he had &s;topped at the inn, and hearing mu&s;ic, had enquired from whence it proceeded, and had gone out of curio&s;ity to the dance; we al&s;o learned that his attendants reported him to be heir to a large fortune: this report, vain as I was, was almo&s;t enough of it&s;elf to engage my heart; judge, then, whether it was not an ea&s;y conque&s;t to a per&s;on who, be&s;ides the above mentioned attraction, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed tho&s;e of a graceful fi|gure, and cultivated mind; he vi&s;ited continually at our cottage, and I, uncultivated as I was, daily &s;trength|ened my&s;elf in his affections; in conver&s;ing with him, I forgot the precepts of vanity and affectation, and obeyed the dictates of nature and &s;en&s;ibility. He &s;oon declared the motives of his vi&s;its to me&mdash;"to have immediately demanded my hand," he &s;aid, "would have gratified the tendere&s;t wi&s;h of his &s;oul&mdash;but&mdash;in his pre&s;ent &s;ituation, that was impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;le&s;t, at an early age, de&s;titute and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, by the death of his parents, an old whim&s;ical uncle, married to a wo|man equally capricious, had adopted him as heir to their large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions&mdash;he found it difficult," he &s;aid, "to &s;ubmit to their ill humour, and was confident, if he took any &s;tep again&s;t their inclinations, he &s;hould forever for|feit their favour; therefore, if my parents would allow a reciprocal promi&s;e to pa&s;s between us, binding each to each, the moment he became ma&s;ter of expected fortune, or obtained an independence, he would make me a par|taker of it." They con&s;ented, and he enjoined us to the &s;tricte&s;t &s;ecrecy, &s;aying, "one of his attendants was placed about him as a kind of &s;py, he had hitherto de|ceived
<PB N="152" REF="038416_0151_1011E28F141BCBF0">
him with re&s;pect to us, declaring my father was an intimate friend, and that his uncle knew he intended vi&s;iting him." But my unfortunate vanity betrayed the &s;ecret it was &s;o material for me to keep, I burned in|deed to reveal it; one morning a young girl, who had been an intimate acquaintance of mine till I knew Marlowe came to &s;ee me&mdash;"Why, Fanny," cried &s;he, "you have given us all up for Mr. Marlowe, take care, my dear, he makes you amends for the lo&s;s of all your other friends." "I &s;hall take your advice," &s;aid I, with a &s;mile and a conceited to&s;s of my head. "Faith for my part," continued &s;he, "I think you were very fooli&s;h not to &s;ecure a good &s;ettlement for your&s;elf with Clod." "With Clod!" repeated I, with the utmo&s;t haughtine&s;s, "Lord, child, you forget who I am!" "Who you are!" exclaimed &s;he, provoked at my in&s;o|lence, "oh yes! to be &s;ure, I forget that you are the daughter of a poor country curate, with more pride in your head than money in your pur&s;e." "Neither do I forget," &s;aid I, "that your ignorance is equal to your impertinence, if I am the daughter of a poor country curate, I am the affianced wife of a rich man, and as much elevated by expectation, as &s;pirit, above you." Our conver&s;ation was repeated throughout the Village, and reached the ears of Marlowe's attendant, who in&s;tantly developed the real motive, which detained him &s;o long in the Village; he wrote to his Uncle an account of the whole affair, the con&s;equence of this was a Letter to poor Marlowe, full of the bit|tere&s;t reproaches, charging him, without delay, to return home; this was like a thunder &s;troke to us all, but there was no alternative between obeying, or forfeiting his uncle's favour. I fear my dear Fanny," cried he, as he folded me to his bo&s;om, a little before his departure, "it will be long ere we &s;hall meet again, nay, I al&s;o fear, I &s;hall be obliged to promi&s;e not to write; if both the&s;e fears are realized impute not ei|ther ab&s;ence or &s;ilence to a want of the tendere&s;t affec|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">on for you." He went, and with him all my happi|ne&s;s; my mother, &s;hortly after his departure, was at|tacked
<PB N="153" REF="038416_0152_1011E290A40ABEE0">
by a nervous fever, which terminated her days; my father, naturally of weak &s;pirits and delicate con&s;ti|tution, was &s;o &s;hocked by the &s;udden death of his belo|ed and faithful companion, that he &s;unk beneath his grief. The horrors of my mind I cannot de&s;cribe; I &s;eemed to &s;tand alone in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, without one friendly hand to prevent my &s;inking into the grave, which con|tained the deare&s;t objects of my love. I did not know where Marlowe lived, and even if I had, dur&s;t not ven|ture an application, which might be the means of ruin|ing him: the e&s;teem of my neighbours I had forfeited by my conceit, they paid no attention but what common humanity dictated, merely to prevent my peri&s;hing; and that they made me &s;en&s;ibly feel&punc; In this di&s;tre&s;s I re|ceived an invitation from a &s;chool fellow of mine, who had married a rich farmer about forty miles from our village to take up my re&s;idence with her, till I was &s;ufficiently recovered to fix on &s;ome plan for future &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence; I gladly accepted the offer, and, after paying a farewell vi&s;it to the grave of my regretted parents, I &s;et off, in the cheape&s;t conveyance I could find, to her habitation, with all my worldly trea&s;ure packed in a portmanteau.</P>
<P>With my friend I tru&s;ted I &s;hould enjoy a calm and happy a&s;ylum, till Marlowe was able to fulfil his promi&s;e, and allow me to reward her kindne&s;s; but, this idea &s;he &s;oon put to flight, by informing me, as my health return|ed, I mu&s;t think of &s;ome method for &s;upporting my&s;elf, I &s;tarted, as at the utter annihilation of all my hopes, for vain and ignorant of the world, I imagined Marlowe would never think of me if once di&s;graced by &s;ervitude; I told her, I under&s;tood little of any thing except fancy work; &s;he was particularly glad, &s;he &s;aid, to hear I knew that, as it would, in all probability, gain me ad|mittance to the &s;ervice of a rich old lady in the neigh|bourhood, who had long been &s;eeking for a per&s;on who could read agreeably and do fancy works, with which &s;he delighted to ornament her hou&s;e; &s;he was a little whim|&s;ical, to be &s;ure, &s;he added, but well timed flattery might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> tho&s;e whims to advantage, and if I regarded my

reputation, I &s;hould not reject &s;o re&s;pectable a protecti|on: there was no alternative; I inquired particularly about her, but how great was my emotion, when I learn|ed &s;he was the aunt of Marlowe&mdash;my heart throbbed with exqui&s;ite delight at the idea of being in the &s;ame hou&s;e with him, be&s;ides, the &s;ervice of his aunt would not, I flattered my&s;elf, degrade me as much in his eyes as that of another per&s;on's; it was nece&s;&s;ary, however, my name &s;hould be concealed, and I reque&s;ted my friend to comply with my wi&s;h in that re&s;pect; &s;he rallied me about my pride, which &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed had &s;ugge&s;ted the reque&s;t, but promi&s;ed to comply with it; &s;he had no doubt but her recommendation would be &s;ufficient to pro|cure me immediate admittance, and, accordingly, taking &s;ome of my work with me, I proceeded to the habitation of Marlowe. It was an antique man&s;ion, &s;urrounded with neat clipped hedges, level lawns, and formal planta|tions; two &s;tatues, ca&s;t in the &s;ame mould, and re&s;emb|ling nothing either in heaven, earth, or &s;ea, &s;tood grin|ning horribly upon the pillars of a ma&s;&s;y gate, as if to guard the entrance from impertinent intru&s;ion: on knocking, an old porter appeared, I gave him my me&s;|&s;age, but he, like the &s;tatues, &s;eemed &s;tationary, and would not, I believe, have &s;tirred from his &s;ituation to deliver an emba&s;&s;y from the king; he called, however, to a dome&s;tic, who happening to be a little deaf, was full half an hour before he heard him; at la&s;t, I was u&s;hered up &s;tairs into an apartment, from the heat of which one might have conjectured it was under the torrid zone; though in the middle of July, a heavy hot fire burned in the grate, a thick carpet, repre&s;enting birds, bea&s;ts and flowers, was &s;pread on the floor, and the windows, clo&s;ely &s;crewed down, were heavy with wood work, and darken|ed with du&s;t; the ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s of the Man&s;ion, like Derby and Joan, &s;at in arm chairs on each &s;ide of the fire, three dogs and as many cats, &s;lumbered at their feet; he was leaning on a &s;pider table, poring over a vo|luminous book, and &s;he was &s;titching a counterpane, &s;ickne&s;s and ill-nature were vi&s;ible in each countenance. "So! &s;aid &s;he, rai&s;ing a huge pair of &s;pectacles at my
<PB N="155" REF="038416_0154_1011E2972DF219A8">
entrance, and examining me from head to foot, "you are come from Mrs. Wil&s;on's, why, ble&s;s me child, you are quite too young for any bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;pray what is your name, and where did you come from? I was prepared for the&s;e que&s;tions, and told her the truth, only con|cealing my real name, and the place of my nativity. "Well let me &s;ee tho&s;e works of yours," cried &s;he, I produced them, and the &s;pectacles were again drawn down; "Why, they are neat enough, to be be &s;ure," &s;aid &s;he, "but the de&s;ign is bad&mdash;very bad indeed; there is ta&s;te! there is execution!" directing me to &s;ome pictures in heavy gilt frames, hung round the room. I told her, with &s;incerity, "I had never &s;een any thing like them." "To be &s;ure, child," exclaimed &s;he, plea&s;|ed at what &s;he con&s;idered admiration in me, "'tis run|ning a great ri&s;k to take you, but if you think you can conform to the regulations of my hou&s;e, I will from compa&s;&s;ion, and as you are recommended by Mrs. Wil|&s;on, venture to engage you; but remember, I mu&s;t have no gad-a-bout, no fly-flapper, no chatterer, in my family; you mu&s;t be decent in your dre&s;s and carriage, di&s;creet in your words, indu&s;trious at your work, and &s;atisfied with the indulgence of going to church on a Sunday." I &s;aw I was about entering on a painful &s;er|vitude, but the idea of its being &s;weetened by the &s;ym|pathy of Marlowe, a little reconciled me to it. On promi&s;ing all &s;he de&s;ired, every thing was &s;ettled for my admi&s;&s;ion into her family, and &s;he took care I &s;hould perform the promi&s;es I made her. I &s;hall not recapi|tulate the various trials I underwent from her au&s;terity and peevi&s;hne&s;s; &s;uffice it to &s;ay, my patience as well as ta&s;te, underwent a perfect martyrdom, I was con|tinually &s;eated at a frame, working pictures of her own invention, which were every thing that was hideous in nature. I was never allowed to go out, except on a Sunday to Church, or on a chance evening when it was too dark to di&s;tingui&s;h colours.</P>
<P>Marlowe was ab&s;ent on my entering the family, nor dur&s;t I a&s;k when he was expected; my health and &s;pi|rits gradually declined from my clo&s;e confinement, when
<PB N="156" REF="038416_0155_1011E299CC6E6750">
allowed, as I have before &s;aid of a chance time to go out, in&s;tead of enjoying the fre&s;h air, I have &s;at down to weep over &s;cenes of former happine&s;s. I dined con&s;tant|ly with the old hou&s;e-keeper, &s;he informed me one day, that Mr. Marlowe, her ma&s;ter's young heir, who had been ab&s;ent &s;ome time on a vi&s;it, was expected home on the en&s;uing day; fortunately the good Dame was too bu&s;ily employed to notice my agitation, I retired as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible from the table, in a &s;tate of inde&s;cribable plea&s;ure, never &s;hall I forget my emotions, when I heard the trampling of his hor&s;es feet, and &s;aw him en|ter the hou&s;e; vainly I endeavoured to re&s;ume my work, my hands trembled, and I &s;unk back on my chair, to indulge the delightful idea of an interview with him, which I believed to be inevitable: my &s;evere ta&s;k-mi&s;|tre&s;s &s;oon awakened me from my delightful dream, &s;he came to tell me, "I mu&s;t confine my&s;elf to my own and the hou&s;e-keeper's room, which, to a virtuous di&s;|creet maiden, &s;uch as I appeared to be, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed would be no hard&s;hip, while her nephew, who was a young, perhaps rather a wild young man, remained in the hou&s;e; when he again left it, which would &s;oon be the ca&s;e, I &s;hould regain my liberty. My heart &s;unk within me at her words, but when the fir&s;t &s;hock was over, I con&s;oled my&s;elf by thinking I &s;hould be able to elude her vigilance; I was, however, mi&s;taken, &s;he and the hou&s;e-keeper, were perfect Argus's: to be in the &s;ame hou&s;e with Marlowe, yet, without his know|ing it, drove me almo&s;t di&s;tracted.</P>
<P>I at la&s;t thought of an expedient, which, I hoped, would effect the di&s;covery I wanted; I had ju&s;t fini&s;hed a piece of work, which my mi&s;tre&s;s was delighted with; it was an enormous flower ba&s;ket, mounted on the back of a cat, which held beneath its paw a trembling mou&s;e; the raptures the old lady expre&s;&s;ed at &s;eeing her own de&s;ign &s;o ably executed, encouraged me to a&s;k permi&s;&s;i|on to embroider a picture of my own de&s;igning, for which I had the &s;ilks lying by me; &s;he complied, and I &s;et about it with alacrity, I copied my face and figure as exactly as I could, and, in mourning drapery and a
<PB N="157" REF="038416_0156_1011E29B5A2EAEB8">
pen&s;ive attitude, placed the little image by a ru&s;tic grave, in the church yard of my native village, at the head of which, half embowered in trees, appeared the lowly cottage of my departed parents: the&s;e well known objects, I thought, would revive, if indeed &s;he was ab|&s;ent from it, the idea of poor Fanny in the mind of Mar|lowe. I pre&s;ented the picture to my mi&s;tre&s;s, who was plea&s;ed with the pre&s;ent, and promi&s;ed to have it framed; the next day, while I &s;at at dinner, the door &s;uddenly opened, and Marlowe entered the room; I thought I &s;hould have fainted, my companion dropped her knife and fork with great precipitation, and Marlowe told her he was very ill, and wanted a cordial from her; &s;he ro&s;e with a di&s;&s;atisfied air to comply with his reque&s;t; he, taking this opportunity of approaching a little nearer, darted a glance of pity and tenderne&s;s, and &s;oftly whi&s;|pered, "to night, at eleven, meet me in the front par|lour." You may conceive how tardily the hours pa&s;t till the appointed time came, when &s;tealing to the par|lour, I found Marlowe expecting me; he folded me to his heart, and his tears mingled with mine, as I related my melancholy tale. "You are now, my fanny," he cried, "entirely mine, deprived of the protection of your tender parents, I &s;hall endeavour to fulfil the &s;acred tru&s;t they repo&s;ed in my honor, by &s;ecuring mine to you, as far as lies in my power; I was not mi&s;taken," continued he, "in the idea I had formed of the treatment I &s;hould receive from my flinty hearted relations on leaving you, had I not promi&s;ed to drop all corre&s;pondence with you, I mu&s;t have relinqui&s;hed all hopes of their favour; bit|ter indeed," cried he, while a tear &s;tarted in his eye, "is the bread of dependence, ill could my &s;oul &s;ubmit to the indignities I received; but, I con&s;oled my&s;elf throughout them, by the idea of future happine&s;s with my Fanny; had I known her &s;ituation, (which indeed it was impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould, as my uncle's &s;py attended me wherever I went) no dictate of prudence would have prevented my flying to her aid!" "Thank Heaven then you were ignorant of it," &s;aid I. My aunt," he pro|ceeded,
<PB N="158" REF="038416_0157_1011E29D88C43B70">
"&s;hewed me your work, lavi&s;hing the highe&s;t encomiums on it, I glanced my eye carele&s;&s;ly upon it, but, in a moment, how was that carele&s;s eye attracted by the well known objects pre&s;ented to it; this, I &s;aid to my heart, can only be Fanny's work; I tried to di&s;|cover from my aunt whether my conjectures were wrong, but without &s;ucce&s;s; when I retired to dre&s;s, I a&s;ked my &s;ervant if there had been any addition to the family during my ab&s;ence, he &s;aid a young woman was hired to do fine works, but &s;he never appeared among the &s;ervants."</P>
<P>Marlowe proceeded to &s;ay, "he could not bear I &s;hould longer continue in &s;ervitude, and that without delay he was re&s;olved to unite his fate to mine." I op|po&s;ed this re&s;olution a little, but &s;oon, too &s;elf-intere&s;t|ed I fear, acquie&s;ced in it; it was agreed I &s;hould in|form his aunt my health would not longer permit my continuing in her family, and that I &s;hould retire to a village &s;ix miles off where Marlowe undertook to bring a young clergyman, a particular friend of his, to perform the ceremony; our plan, as &s;ettled, was carried into exe|cution, and I became the wife of Marlowe.

"Therefore," cried I, forgetting every dictate of pru|dence, "his wi&s;e will neither de&s;ire nor receive it in fu|ture." "His wife!" &s;he repeated, with a look of &s;corn and incredulity. I produced the certificate of my mar|riage, thus, from an impul&s;e of vanity and re&s;entment, putting my&s;elf in the power of a woman, a &s;tranger to every liberal feeling, and who&s;e mind was inflamed with envy toward me; the hint I forced my&s;elf at parting to give her, to keep the affair &s;ecret, only determined her more &s;trongly to reveal it; the day after her vi&s;it Marlowe entered my apartment, pale, agitated, and breathle&s;s, he &s;unk into a chair; a pang like con&s;cious guilt &s;mote my heart, and I trembled as I approached him; he repul&s;ed me when I attempted to touch his hand: "Cruel, incon&s;iderate woman," he &s;aid, "to what dread|ful lengths has your vanity hurried you, it has drawn de&s;|truction upon your own head as well as mine." Shame and remor&s;e tied my tongue, had I &s;poken, indeed, I could not have vindicated my&s;elf, and I turned a&s;ide and wept. Marlowe, mild, tender, and adoring, could not long retain re&s;entment; he &s;tarted from his chair, and cla&s;ped me to his bo&s;om&mdash;"Oh Fanny!" he cried, "though you have ruined me, you are &s;till dear as ever to me." This tenderne&s;s affected me even more than reproaches, and tears, and &s;ighs, declared my penitence; his expectations relative to his uncle were finally de&s;troy|ed,

There was &s;omething &s;o &s;olemn, and &s;o ten|der, in this addre&s;s, that my heart melted and my tears mingled with tho&s;e which trickled down his pale cheeks; for two days I attended my child a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly, when the widow made her appearance; &s;he a&s;&s;ured me I &s;hould injure my&s;elf by &s;uch clo&s;e confinement, and that my cheeks were already faded by it, &s;he mentioned a de|lightful ma&s;querade, which was to be given that night, and for which Lord T&mdash;had pre&s;ented her with tickets for me and her&s;elf; but, &s;he declared, except I would accompany her, &s;he would not go. I had often wi&s;hed to go to a ma&s;querade, I now, however, declined this opportunity of gratifying my inclination, but &s;o faintly as to prompt a renewal of her &s;olicitations, to which I at la&s;t yielded, and, committing my babe to the care of a &s;ervant, &s;et off with the widow to a warehou&s;e to choo&s;e dre&s;&s;es. Lord T&mdash;dined with us, and we were all in the highe&s;t &s;pirits imaginable; about twelve we went in his chariot to the Haymarket, and I was ab&s;olutely intoxicated with his flattery, and the dazzling objects around me; at five we quitted this &s;cene of gaiety, the widow took a chair, I would have followed her example, but my Lord ab&s;olutely li&s;ted me into his chariot, and there began talking in a &s;train which provoked my con|tempt, and excited my apprehen&s;ions. I expre&s;&s;ed my de&s;plea&s;ure in terms which checked his boldne&s;s, and convinced him he had &s;ome difficulties yet to overcome, ere he completed his de&s;igns: he made his apologies with &s;o much humility that I was &s;oon appea&s;ed and pre|vailed on to accept them.

<HEAD>THE LETTER.</HEAD>
<P>The pre&s;ages of my heart were but too true&mdash;we parted never to meet again&mdash;oh! Fanny, beloved of my &s;oul, how are you lo&s;t to your&s;elf and Marlowe. The in|dependence, &s;plendour, riches, which I gave up for your &s;ake were mean &s;acrifices, in my e&s;timation, to the felici|ty I fondly expected to have enjoyed with you through life&mdash;your beauty charmed my mind, but, it was your &s;implicity captivated my heart&mdash;I took, as I thought, the perfect child of innocence and &s;incerity to my bo&s;om; re&s;olved, from duty, as well as from inclination, to &s;hel|ter you in that bo&s;om, to the utmo&s;t of my power, from every adver&s;e &s;torm; whenever you were indi&s;po&s;|ed what agonies did I endure, yet, what I then dreaded, could I have po&s;&s;ibly fore&s;een, would have been compa|rative happine&s;s, to my pre&s;ent mi&s;ery; for, oh! my Fanny, far preferable would it have been, to behold you in the arms of death than infamy.</P>
<P>I returned immediately after witne&s;&s;ing the la&s;t pangs of my friend&mdash;oppre&s;&s;ed with the awful &s;cene of death, yet, cheering my &s;pirits by an anticipation of the
<PB N="164" REF="038416_0163_1011E2AC4AF75B98">
con&s;olation I &s;hould receive from my Fanny's &s;ympathy.&mdash;Good God! what was my horror, when I found my little babe, in&s;tead of being re&s;tored to health, by a mother's care, nearly expiring through her neglect&mdash;the angel lay ga&s;ping on her bed, de&s;erted by the mer|cenary wretch to who&s;e care &s;he was con&s;igned. I in|quired, and the fatal truth ru&s;hed upon my &s;oul, yet, when the fir&s;t tumult of pa&s;&s;ion had &s;ub&s;ided, I felt that, without yet &s;tronger proofs, I could not abandon you; alas! too &s;oon did I receive tho&s;e proofs&mdash;I traced you, Fanny, through your giddy round, till I &s;aw you borne in the arms of the vile Lord T&mdash;into the hou&s;e of his vile paramour&mdash;You will wonder, perhaps, I did not tear you from his gra&s;p&mdash;could &s;uch a procedure have re&s;tored you to me, with all your un&s;ullied innocence, I &s;hould not have he&s;itated, but, that was impo&s;&s;ible, and my eyes then gazed upon Fanny for the la&s;t time. I returned to my motherle&s;s babe, and am not a&s;hamed to &s;ay, I wept over it with all the agonies of a fond and betrayed heart.</P>
<P>Ere I bid an irrevocable adieu, I would, if po&s;&s;ible, endeavour to convince you that con&s;cience cannot always be &s;tifled, that illicit love is con&s;tantly attended by re|mor&s;e and di&s;appointment; for, when familiarity or di&s;|ea&s;e, have dimini&s;hed the charms which excited it, the frail fetters of admiration are broken by him who looks only to an exterior for delight; if indeed your con&s;cience &s;hould not be awakened till this hour of de&s;ertion comes, when it does arrive, you may perhaps think of Marlowe&mdash;Yes, Fanny, when your cheeks are faded by care, when your wit is enfeebled by de&s;pondency, you may think of him who&s;e tenderne&s;s would have outlived both time and change, and &s;upported you, without abatement, through every &s;tage of life.</P>
<P>To &s;top &s;hort in the career of vice is, they &s;ay, the noble&s;t effort of virtue; may &s;uch an effort be yours, and may you yet give joy to the angels of heaven, who, we are taught to believe, rejoice over them that truly re|pent. That want &s;hould &s;trew no thorns in the path of penitence, all that I could take from my babe I have

When my confu&s;ion and di&s;tre&s;s had a little &s;ub&s;ided, he informed me, that in the morning he had received a letter from him, with an account of our &s;eparation, and the fatal cau&s;e of it; the letter contained a deed of &s;et|tlement on me, of a &s;mall paternal e&s;tate, and a bill of fifty pounds, which Marlowe reque&s;ted his friend to pre|&s;ent him&s;elf to me; he al&s;o added my clothes were &s;ent to his hou&s;e, as our lodgings had been di&s;charged. I did not find it difficult to convince this gentleman of my innocence, and, putting my&s;elf under his protecti|on, was immediately conveyed to lodgings in a retired part of the town; here he con&s;oled me with a&s;&s;urance of u&s;ing every effort to di&s;cover the re&s;idence, of my hu&s;band, all, alas! proved un&s;ucce&s;sful, and my health gradually declined; as time wore away, my hope yet left &s;till undimini&s;hed my de&s;ire of &s;eeing him; change of air was at la&s;t deemed requi&s;ite to pre&s;erve my exi&s;t|ence, and I went to Bri&s;tol. I had the good fortune to lodge in the hou&s;e with an elderly Iri&s;h Lady, who&s;e &s;weet and benevolent manners &s;oon gained my warme&s;t e&s;teem, and tempted me to divulge my melancholy tale, where &s;o certain of obtaining pity; &s;he had al&s;o &s;uffer|ed &s;everely from the pre&s;&s;ure of &s;orrow, but hers, as it proceeded not from imprudence, but the common vici&s;&s;itudes of life, was borne without that degree of angui&s;h mine occa&s;ioned: as the period approached for

Five years I pa&s;&s;ed with my valuable friend in retirement, and had the plea&s;ure of thinking I had contributed to the ea&s;e of her la&s;t mo|ments; this cottage, with a few acres adjoining it, and four hundred pounds, was all her wealth, and to me &s;he bequeathed it, having no relations who&s;e wants gave them any claim upon her."</P>

&s;carcely to be articulate; O&s;car gently &s;eized her hand and pulled it under his arm, he felt it tremble as he did &s;o, the touch became contagious, an univer&s;al tremor affected his frame, and never, perhaps, had he and Adela experi|enced a moment of greater unhappine&s;s. Adela at la&s;t found her&s;elf obliged to &s;peak&punc; con&s;cious that her &s;ilence mu&s;t appear particular, and &s;aid, &s;he feared he would be injured by his attentions to her. More fatally injured than he already was, he might have replied, he could not be; but he checked the words ready to bur&s;t from his lips and only an&s;wered that he would be unfit for a &s;oldier if he could not endure the inclemency of the wintry bla&s;t. The light from the globes of the carriage gave him a view of her pale lovely cheeks, and he &s;aw &s;he was weeping&mdash;confu&s;ed at the idea of betraying her di&s;tre&s;s &s;he averted her head, and ha&s;tily a&s;cended the &s;teps; yet for a moment, her trembling hand re&s;ted upon O&s;|car's, as if, in this manner, &s;he would have given the adieu &s;he had not the power of pronouncing. Lo&s;t in agony, he remained like a &s;tatue on the &s;pot where &s;he had left him, till rou&s;ed by the friendly voice of Mrs. Marlowe, who, alarmed at his long ab&s;ence, came to &s;eek him; &s;oothed by her kind &s;olicitude, he directly returned with her to the hou&s;e, where his indignation again&s;t the perfidious Belgrave again broke forth&mdash;he execrated him, not only as the de&s;troyer of his peace, but a peace infinitely more precious than his own, that of the charming Adela's.</P>
<P>Mrs. Marlowe e&s;&s;ayed every art of con&s;olation, and, by &s;ympathy and mildne&s;s, at la&s;t &s;ubdued the violence of his feelings; &s;he acknowledged the lo&s;s he &s;u&s;tained in being deprived of Adela, but, &s;ince irrevocable, both virtue and rea&s;on required him to &s;truggle again&s;t his grief, and conceal it; by their &s;acred dictates &s;he en|treated him to avoid &s;eeing Adela; he felt &s;he was right in the entreaty, and &s;olemnly promi&s;ed to comply with it; her friend&s;hip was balm to his wounded heart, and her &s;ociety the only plea&s;ure he was capable of enjoying, whenever he could ab&s;ent him&s;elf from quarters he re|tired

to her, and frequently &s;pent three or four days at a time in her cottage. By di&s;continuing his vi&s;its in the gay neighbourhood of Woodlawn, he avoided all opportunities of &s;eeing Adela, yet often on a clear fro&s;|ty night has he &s;tole from the fire &s;ide of Mrs. Mar|lowe, to the beloved and beautiful haunts about the lake, where he and Adela pa&s;t &s;o many happy hours to|gether; here he indulged in all the luxury of woe, and &s;uch are the plea&s;ures of virtuous melancholy, that O&s;|car would not have re&s;igned them for any of the com|mon place enjoyments of life.</P>
<P>Often did he wander to the grove from whence he had a view of Adela's chamber, and if a lucky chance gave him a glimp&s;e of her, as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed through it, a &s;udden ec|&s;ta&s;y would pervade his bo&s;om; he would pray for her felicity, and return to Mrs. Marlowe as if his heart was lightened of an oppre&s;&s;ive weight. That tender friend flattered her&s;elf, from youth, and the natural gaiety of his di&s;po&s;ition, his attachment, no longer fed by hope, would gradually decline; but &s;he was mi&s;taken&mdash;the bloom of his youth was faded, and his gaiety converted into deep de&s;pondency: had he never been undeceived with regard to the General and Adela, pride, no doubt, would quickly have le&s;&s;ened the poignancy of his feelings; but when he reflected on the generous in|tentions of the one, and the &s;incere affections of the other, and the &s;upreme happine&s;s he might have enjoy|ed, he lo&s;t all fortitude: thus by perpetually brooding over the ble&s;&s;ings once within his reach, loo&s;ing all reli&s;h for tho&s;e which were yet attainable, his &s;orrow, in&s;tead of being meliorated, was increa&s;ed by time; the horror and indignation with which he beheld Belgrave, after the fir&s;t knowledge of his ba&s;ene&s;s, could &s;carcely be re&s;trained; though painful, he was plea&s;ed the effort had proved a &s;ucce&s;sful one, as, exclu&s;ive of his &s;acred promi&s;e to Mrs. Marlowe, deli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">cy on Adela's account, induced him to bear his wrongs in &s;ilence; he could not, however be &s;o great an hypocrite as to profe&s;s any long|er e&s;teem or re&s;pect for the colonel, and when they met, it was with cold politene&s;s on both &s;ides.</P>

The unfortunate Adela pined in &s;ecret, her interview with O&s;car had de&s;troyed the &s;mall remainder of her peace; his pale and emaciated figure haunted her ima|gination, in vain, by dwelling on his unkind letter, did &s;he endeavour to le&s;&s;en her tenderne&s;s; &s;he felt the emotion of pity &s;tronger than that of re&s;entment, and that the friend&s;hip of O&s;car would have been &s;weeter to her &s;oul, than the love or attention of any other object; by obeying the impul&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he feared &s;he had doomed her&s;elf to wretchedne&s;s. Belgrave was a man, whom, upon mature deliberation, &s;he could never have cho&s;en, the &s;oftne&s;s of his manners gradually vani&s;hed, when the purpo&s;e for which they had been a&s;&s;umed was completed&mdash;unfeeling and depraved, the virtues of Ade|la could excite no e&s;teem in his bo&s;om, and the love (if it can merit that appellation) which he felt for her, quickly &s;ub&s;ided after their marriage; but, as the Ge|neral retained the greate&s;t part of his fortune in his own power, he continued tolerably guarded in his conduct&mdash;a &s;lave, however, to the mo&s;t violent pa&s;&s;io<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s, he was often unable to controul them, and forgetful of all prudential motives, delighted at tho&s;e times in mortifying Adela, by &s;ly &s;arca&s;ms on her attachment for O&s;car; though deeply wounded, &s;he never complain|ed, &s;he had partly forged her chains, and re&s;olved to bear them without repining; tranquil in appearance, the poor General, who was not penetrating, thought his child perfectly happy, &s;uch, however, was not the opinion of tho&s;e who vi&s;ited at Woodlawn; the ro&s;e of health no longer &s;pread its beautiful tints on the cheek of Adela, nor were her eyes eradiated by vivacity.</P>
<P>The Colonel never went to Enni&s;kellen except about military bu&s;ine&s;s, but he made frequent excur&s;ions to the metropolis, and other parts of the kingdom, in pur|&s;uit of plea&s;ure. Adela felt relieved by his ab&s;ence, and the General, &s;atisfied at his not attempting to take her along with him, never murmured at it; the period now arrived for the departure of the regiment; Adela had not &s;een O&s;car &s;ince the interview at Mrs. Marlowe's, &s;he declined going to the reviews which preceded the

change of garri&s;on, and &s;incerely hoped no chance would again throw him in her way. O&s;car &s;ickened at the idea of quitting the country without &s;eeing her, he knew &s;he was not to accompany the colonel; the officers were go|ing to pay a farewell vi&s;it to Woodlawn, and he could not re&s;i&s;t being one of the party, they were &s;hewn into the drawing room, where Adela and the General &s;at: &s;he was &s;tartled at the appearance of O&s;car, but, though a blu&s;h tinged her pale face, &s;he &s;oon recovered her com|po&s;ure, and entered into conver&s;ation; the General pre&s;&s;ed them to &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ay to dinner, but they had many vi&s;its to pay and begged to be excu&s;ed. "My dear Fitzalan," &s;aid the General, who had long dropped his di&s;plea&s;ure, "I wi&s;h you happine&s;s and &s;ucce&s;s, and hope I &s;hall &s;oon hear of your being at the head of a company, remem|ber I &s;ay &s;oon, for I am an old veteran, and &s;hould be &s;or|ry to drop into the trench till I had heard of the good fortune of my friends; your father was a brave fellow, and, in the &s;peedy advancement of his &s;on, &s;hould re|ceive a reward for his pa&s;t &s;ervices." O&s;car pre&s;&s;ed the General's hand to his brea&s;t, he ca&s;t his tearful eyes on Adela, &s;he &s;ighed and bent her's to the ground.&mdash;"Be a&s;&s;ured, Sir," he cried, "no gratitude can be more fervent than that your goodne&s;s has in&s;pired me with, no wi&s;hes can be more &s;incere than mine for the happine&s;s of the inhabitants of Woodlawn." "Ineffectual wi&s;h|es," &s;oftly exclaimed Adela, "happine&s;s from one of its inhabitants, at lea&s;t, has, I fear, fled for ever."</P>
<P>The general's wi&s;hes for the &s;ucce&s;s of O&s;car may be con&s;idered as mere words of cour&s;e, &s;ince not enforced by more &s;ub&s;tantial proofs of regard; but, in reality, &s;oon after his daughter's marriage, in his u&s;ual blunt manner, he had mentioned to the colonel his giving a thou&s;and or two to help the promotion of O&s;car. Belgrave, who could not bear that the man whom he had injured &s;hould have a chance of obtaining equal rank with him&s;elf, op|po&s;ed this truly generous de&s;ign, by &s;aying, O&s;car was taken under the patronage of Lord Cherbury, and that the general's bounty might, therefore, at &s;ome future period, be better applied in &s;erving a per&s;on without his

<P>O&s;car obtained a ready promi&s;e from Mrs. Marlowe, of corre&s;ponding with him, he blu&s;hed, and faltered, as he be&s;ought her &s;ometimes to acquaint him with the health of their friends at Woodlawn.</P>
<P>Change of &s;cene produced no alteration in him, &s;till pining with regret, and languid from ill health, his father and &s;i&s;ter found him, the comforts of &s;ympathy could not be his, as the angui&s;h which preyed on his heart, he con|&s;idered of too &s;acred a nature to divulge; he hoarded up his grief like a mi&s;er hoarding up his trea&s;ure, fearful that the eye of &s;u&s;picion &s;hould glance at it; as he pre&s;&s;|ed his lovely &s;i&s;ter to his heart, had he imagined &s;he was the object of Colonel Belgraves licentious pa&s;&s;ion, the bounds he had hitherto pre&s;cribed to his re&s;entment, would in a moment have been overturned, and he would, had it been nece&s;&s;ary, have pur&s;ued the mon&s;ter round the world, to avenge the injury he had meditated, as well as the one he had committed.</P>

<P>CASTLE Carberry, to which our travellers were going, was a large Gothic pile, erected in the rude and di&s;tant period when &s;trength, more than elegance, was deemed nece&s;&s;ary in a building; the depredations of war, as well as time, were di&s;cernible on its exterior, &s;ome of its lofty battlements were broken, and others mouldering to decay, while about its ancient towers,
<Q><L>The rank gra&s;s waved its head,</L>

<P>It &s;tood upon a rocky eminence overhanging the &s;ea, and commanding a delightful pro&s;pect of the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t of Scotland; about it were yet to be traced irregu|lar fortifications, a moat, and the remains of a draw|bridge, with a well, long &s;ince dry, which had been dug in the rock, to &s;upply the inhabitants, in times of &s;iege, with water; on one &s;ide ro&s;e a &s;tupendous hill, covered to the very &s;ummit with trees, and &s;cattered over with relics of druidical antiquity; before it &s;tretched an exten|&s;ive and gently &s;welling lawn, &s;heltered on each &s;ide with groves of intermingled &s;hade, and refre&s;hed by a clear and meandering rivulet, that took its ri&s;e from the adjoining hill, and murmured o'er a bed of pebbles.</P>
<P>After a plea&s;ant journey, on the evening of the fourth day, our travellers arrived at their de&s;tined habitation, an old man and woman who had the care of it, were appri&s;ed of their coming, and on the fir&s;t approach of the carriage opened the ma&s;&s;y door, and waited to receive them;

they reached it when the &s;ober grey of twilight had clad every object. Amanda viewed the dark and &s;tupendous edifice, who&s;e gloom was now heightened by the &s;hadows of evening, with venerable awe; the &s;olitude, the &s;ilence which reigned around, the melancholy murmur of the waves, as they da&s;hed again&s;t the feet of the rocks, all heightened the &s;adne&s;s of her mind, yet it was not quite an unplea&s;ing &s;adne&s;s, for with it was now mingled a degree of that enthu&s;ia&s;m, which plaintive and romantic &s;pirits are &s;o peculiarly &s;ubject to feel in viewing the venerable grandeur of an ancient fabric renowned in hi&s;tory. As &s;he entered a &s;pacious hall, curiou&s;ly, wain|&s;cotted with oak, ornamented with coats of arms, &s;pears, lances, and old armour; &s;he could not avoid ca&s;ting a retro&s;pective eye to former times, when, perhaps, in this very hall, bards &s;ung the exploits of tho&s;e heroes who&s;e u&s;ele&s;s arms now hung upon the walls; &s;he wi&s;hed, in the romance of the moment, &s;ome grey bard near her, to tell the deeds of other times, of kings renowed in our land, of chiefs we behold no more; in the niches in the hall were figures of chieftains, large as life, and rudely carved in oak, their frowning countenances &s;truck a &s;ud|den panic upon the heart of Ellen.&mdash;"Cot ple&s;s their &s;ouls," &s;he &s;aid, "what the tefil did they do there, except to frighten the people from going into the hou&s;e?</P>
<P>They were &s;hewn into a large parlour furni&s;hed in an old fa&s;hioned manner, and found a comfortable &s;upper prepared for them; oppre&s;&s;ed with fatigue, &s;oon after they had partaken of it they retired to re&s;t. The next morning, immediately after breakfa&s;t, Amanda, atted|ed by the old woman and Ellen, ranged over the ca&s;tle; its interior was quite as Gothic as its exterior, the &s;tairs were winding, the galleries intricate, the apartments numerous, and mo&s;tly hung with old tape&s;try, repre&s;ent|ing Iri&s;h battles, in which the Chiefs of Ca&s;tle Carber|ry were particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed; their portraits, with tho&s;e of their ladies, occupied a long gallery, who&s;e arched windows ca&s;t a dim, religious light upon them; this was terminated by a &s;mall apartment in the centre of one of the towers that flanked the building; the room

was an octagon, and thus commanding a &s;ea and land pro&s;pect, uniting at once the &s;ublime and beautiful in it; the furniture was not only modern but elegant, and excited the particular attention and inquiries of Aman|da; the old woman informed her this had been the dre&s;|&s;ing room of the late Counte&s;s of Cherbury, both be|fore and after her marriage, "one of the &s;weete&s;t, kinde&s;t ladies," continued &s;he, "I ever knew; the ca&s;|tle has been quite de&s;erted &s;ince &s;he died&mdash;a lack a day! I thought my poor heart would have broke when I heard of her death: ah! I remember the night I heard the Ban&s;hee crying &s;o pitifully." "And pray what is that?" interrupted Amanda. "Why, a little woman no high|er than a yard, who wears a blue petticoat, a red cloak, and a kerchief round her head; and when the head of any family, e&s;pecially a great family is to die, &s;he is always heard, by &s;ome of the old followers, bemoaning her&s;elf." "Lort &s;ave us! cried Ellen, "I hope his Lort&s;hip the Earl won't take it into his head to die while we are here, for I'd as lief &s;ee one of the faries of Penmaenmowr, as &s;uch a little old witch." "Well, proceed," &s;aid Amanda. "So, as I was &s;aying&punc; I heard her crying di&s;mally one night in a corner of the hou&s;e; &s;o &s;ays I to my hu&s;band, Johnaten, &s;ays I, I am &s;ure we &s;hall hear &s;omething about my good Lord or Lady, and &s;ure enough we did the next day, and ever &s;ince we have &s;een none of the family." Did you ever &s;ee the young Lord?" a&s;ked Amanda, with involuntary precipitation. "See him, ay that I did, when he was about eight years old, there is his picture, (pointing to one which hung over the chimney) my lady had it done by a fine Engli&s;h painter, and brought it over with her, it is the moral of what he then was." The eager eyes of Amanda were in&s;tantly turned to it, and &s;he traced, or imagined &s;he did &s;o, a re&s;emblance &s;till between it and him; the painter &s;eemed as if he had the de|&s;cription of pity in his mind, when he drew the picture, for Lord Mortimer was portrayed as &s;he is repre&s;ented in the beautiful allegory, &s;heltering a trembling dove in his bo&s;om from a ferocious hawk. Oh! Mortimer,

thought Amanda, thy feeling nature is here ably deli|neated, the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, or the helple&s;s, to the utmo&s;t of your power, you would &s;ave from the gripe of cruelty and oppre&s;&s;ion. Her father had de&s;ired her to chu&s;e plea&s;ant apartments for her own immediate u&s;e, and &s;he accordingly fixed on this and the room adjoining it, which had been Lady Cherbury's chamber; her things were brought hither, and her books, works, and im|plements for drawing depo&s;ited in rich inlaid cabinets; plea&s;ed with the arrangements &s;he had made, &s;he brought her father as &s;oon as he was at lei&s;ure to view them; he was happy to find her &s;pirits &s;omewhat cheer|ful and compo&s;ed, and declared in future he would call this Amanda's Tower: accompanied by him &s;he a&s;cend|ed to the battlements of the Ca&s;tle, and was delighted with the exten&s;ive and variegated pro&s;pect &s;he beheld from them; a &s;pacious edifice at &s;ome di&s;tance embow|ered in a grove of venerable oaks, attracted her admi|ration; her father told her that was Ul&s;ter lodge, a &s;eat belonging to the Marquis of Ro&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ine, who was an Iri&s;h as well as a Scotch peer, and had very exten&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions in Ireland; Fitzalan added, he had been enquiring of the old man about the neighbourhood, and learned from him that at the expiration of every three or four years, the Marquis u&s;ually came over to Ul&s;ter lodge, but had never been accompanied by the Marchione&s;s, or Lady Euphra&s;ia Sutherland, who was his only child.</P>
<P>The dome&s;tic economy of Ca&s;tle Carberry was &s;oon &s;ettled, a young man and woman were hired, as John|aten and his wife Kate were con&s;idered little more than &s;upernumeraries; Ellen was appointed to attend Aman|da, and do whatever plain work was required. Fitza|lan felt a plea&s;ing &s;erenity diffu&s;ed over his mind from the idea of being in &s;ome degree independent, and in the way of making &s;ome provi&s;ion for his children. The fir&s;t &s;hock of a &s;eparation from Lord Mortimer being over, the cheerfulne&s;s of Amanda gradually returned, the vi&s;ions of hope again revived in her mind, and &s;he indulged a &s;ecret plea&s;ure at living in the hou&s;e he had once occupied; &s;he con&s;idered her father as particularly
<PB N="178" REF="038416_0177_1011E2CBC94B5560">
connected with his family, and doubted not, from this circum&s;tance, &s;he &s;hould &s;ometimes hear of him; &s;he judged of his con&s;tancy by her own, and believed he would not readily forget her; &s;he acknowledged her fa|ther's motives for &s;eparating them were equally ju&s;t and delicate, but firmly believed if Lord Mortimer (as &s;he flattered her&s;elf he would) confe&s;&s;ed a partiality in her favour to his father, that influenced by tenderne&s;s for his &s;on, friend&s;hip for her father, and the knowledge of her de&s;cent, he would immediately give up every idea of another connexion, and &s;anction theirs with his ap|probation; no ob&s;tacle appeared to &s;uch an union but want of fortune, and that want &s;he could never &s;uppo&s;e would be con&s;idered as one, by the liberal minded Lord Cherbury, who had him&s;elf an income &s;ufficient to gra|tify even luxurious wi&s;hes. Her time was agreeably diver&s;ified by the &s;ources of amu&s;ement &s;he drew from her&s;elf; her father, who&s;e &s;upreme felicity con&s;i&s;ted in contributing to her plea&s;ure&punc; purcha&s;ed a delightful harp for her in Dublin; which arrived a few days after them at Ca&s;tle Carberry, and with its dulcet lays &s;he often charmed not only his &s;pirit but her own, from every mortal care; &s;he loved to ri&s;e early and catch the fir&s;t beams of the &s;un, and as &s;he wandered o'er the dewy lawn, where the lowing cattle cropped the flowery herb|age, and the milk maid &s;ung her plaintive ditty.</P>
<P>With her father &s;he took long walks about the adja|cent country, he had vi&s;ited every &s;cene before and now pointed out whatever was worthy her attention; the &s;pots where the heroes of former ages had fallen, where the mighty &s;tones of their fame were rai&s;ed, that the children of the north might hereafter know the places where their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fought; that the hunter, as he lean|ed upon a mo&s;&s;y tomb might &s;ay&mdash;Here fought the he|roes of other years, and their fame &s;ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l la&s;t for ever.</P>
<P>Amanda too often rambled by her&s;elf, particularly among the rocks, where were &s;everal natural grottos, &s;trewed with &s;hells and &s;ea weeds; here, of a mild day, &s;he loved to read and li&s;ten to the low murmurs of the tide; the oppo&s;ite Scotti&s;h hills, among which her mother

<P>THE &s;olitude of Ca&s;tle Carberry was inter|rupted in le&s;s than a fortnight, by vi&s;its and invitati|ons from the neighbouring families; the fir&s;t they ac|cepted was to dine at Mr. Kilcorban's; he was a man of large fortune, which, in the opinion of many, com|pen&s;ated for the want of poli&s;hed manners, and a culti|vated mind; but, to others of a more liberal way of thinking, could not po&s;&s;ibly excu&s;e tho&s;e deficiencies, which were more apparent from his pretending to every excellence, and more intolerable from his deeming him|&s;elf authorized, by his wealth and con&s;equence, to &s;ay and do almo&s;t whatever he plea&s;ed.

elegance and perfection; the young heir had been &s;ent to the univer&s;ity, but, permitted to be his own ma&s;ter, he had profited little by his re&s;idence there; enough, however, perhaps he thought, for a man of fortune, who wanted not profe&s;&s;ional knowledge; his face was coar&s;e, his per&s;on inelegant, and his ta&s;te in adorning him&s;elf prepo&s;terou&s;ly ridiculous; fa&s;hion, Hoyle, and the look|ing gla&s;s were his chief &s;tudies, and, by his family and &s;elf, he was con&s;idered quite the thing.</P>
<P>The young ladies were &s;uppo&s;ed to be very accompli&s;h|ed becau&s;e they had in&s;tructors in almo&s;t every branch of education, but, in reality, they under&s;tood little more than the names of what they were attempted to be taught; nature had not been lavi&s;h of her gifts, of this, however, they were con&s;cious, and patched, powdered, and painted, in the very extremity of the mode; their mornings were generally &s;pent in rolling about in a coach and &s;ix, with their mamma, collecting news, and paying vi&s;its; their evenings were con&s;tantly devoted to compa|ny, without which they declared they could not exi&s;t; they &s;ometimes affected langour and &s;entiment, talked of friend&s;hip; and profe&s;&s;ed for numbers the mo&s;t &s;incere; yet to the very girls they pretended to regard, delighted in exhibiting their finery, if certain they could not pur|cha&s;e the &s;ame, and would feel mortified by &s;eeing it.</P>
<P>Mr. Kilcorban had indulged his family in a trip to Bath one autumn, and, in &s;o doing, had afforded a never failing &s;ubject for conver&s;ation; upon every occa&s;ion, this delightful excur&s;ion was mentioned, the novelties they &s;aw, the admiration they excited, the elegant inti|macies they formed, the amazing &s;um they expended, were all de&s;cribed and exaggerated.</P>
<P>Lady Grey&s;tock, an ancient widow, was at pre&s;ent on a vi&s;it to them, &s;he had known Fitzalan in his youth, and now, with plea&s;ure, renewed her intimacy with him, and the account &s;he gave of his family and connections, pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the neighbourhood in his favour: &s;he was a &s;hrewd, &s;en&s;ible woman, the dignity of her per&s;on com|manded re&s;pect, but the &s;arca&s;tic expre&s;&s;ion of her coun|tenance prevented her con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">iating e&s;teem.</P>

An old chariot belonging to the Earl of Cherbury, which had been for years unemployed in the coach hou&s;e, was brought forth for the purpo&s;e of conveying Fitzalan and his daughter on their vi&s;its; after a good deal of rubbing and wa&s;hing, it was found tolerable decent, and they proceeded in it to Mr. Kilcorban's, which was about two miles from Ca&s;tle Carberry; a numerous party was already a&s;&s;embled, while Amanda was paying her com|pliments to Mrs. Kilcorban and Lady Grey&s;tock, a ge|neral whi&s;per relative to her took place among the youn|ger part of the company, who had formed them&s;elves into a group quite di&s;tant from the re&s;t. One gentle|man &s;wore, "&s;he was a devili&s;h fine girl!" he was &s;e|conded in the remark by another, who extolled her com|plexion. "You are a &s;impleton," cried a young lady, who was reckoned a great wit, "I'd engage, for half a crown, to get as fine a colour in Dublin." Her compa|nions laughed, and declared &s;he only &s;poke truth in &s;ay|ing &s;o. Mr. Bryan Kilcorban, who leaned on her chair, &s;aid, "a bill &s;hould be brought into the hou&s;e to tax &s;uch complexions: for kill me," continued he, "the la|dies are &s;o irre&s;i&s;tible from nature, it is quite uncon&s;ci|onable to call in art as an auxiliary." He then &s;talked over to Amanda, who &s;at by Lady Grey&s;tock, lolling over her chair, he declared, "he thought the tedious hours would never elap&s;e, till again ble&s;&s;ed with her pre|&s;ence; of her," he &s;aid, "it was &s;ufficient to have but one glimp&s;e to make him pant for the &s;econd." A &s;um|mons to dinner relieved her from this non&s;en&s;e; luxury and o&s;tentation were con&s;picuous in the fare and decora|tions of the table, and Amanda never felt any hours &s;o tedious as tho&s;e &s;he pa&s;t at it; when the ladies returned to the drawing room, the Mi&s;s Kilcorban's, and their companions, began to examine and admire her dre&s;s.&mdash;"What a pretty pattern this gown is worked in," &s;aid one.

"Oh really, then, it is in your power; 'tis only to refu&s;e the pattern of your cap to any girls who may a&s;k you for it, and to give it to me and my &s;i&s;ter, you can't conceive how we doat on being the fir&s;t in the fa&s;hion, one is &s;o &s;tared at, and &s;o envied, I dete&s;t any thing when it becomes common, you can't think how we are teazed every &s;ummer, when we return from Dublin, for fa&s;hions, but we always make it a point to refu&s;e; I mu&s;t tell you a delightful trick I played a friend of mine, &s;he received a large pre&s;ent of the mo&s;t beautiful mu&s;lins from India, which &s;he laid by till I returned from town, &s;uppo&s;ing I would let her &s;ee my things, as I always told her I was ex|tremely fond of her; well, I lent her a gown, which was quite old fa&s;hioned, but, a&s;&s;ured her it was the very newe&s;t mode, &s;he accordingly had her beautiful mu&s;lins cut in imitation of it, and &s;o &s;poiled them from making any other habit; well, we met at an a&s;&s;ize ball, where all the elegant people of the county were a&s;&s;embled, and, I declare, I never &s;aw &s;o ridiculous a figure as &s;he made; when &s;he found her&s;elf unlike every one in the room, I really thought &s;he would have fainted, and that my &s;i&s;ter and I &s;hould have expired with laughing; poor thing, the tears ab&s;olutely trickled down her cheeks, don't you think it was a charming trick?" "Very much &s;o," &s;aid Amanda, "I think it gave a &s;triking &s;pecimen of your humour." "Well my dear," exclaim|ed Mi&s;s Kilcorban, without minding the marked em|pha&s;is of Amanda's la&s;t words, "if you allow us, my &s;i&s;ter and I will call on you to-morrow and look over your things." "It would be giving your&s;elves a great deal of unnece&s;&s;ary trouble," replied Amanda coolly, who did not by any means reli&s;h this forward propo&s;al, "my things can boa&s;t of little but &s;implicity, and I am always my own milliner." "Really, well, I prote&s;t you have a great deal of ta&s;te, my maid, who is very handy, would, I think, be able to make up things in pretty much the &s;ame &s;tile, if you, were obliging enough to

"No." "Oh! then, I a&s;&s;ure you, you have a mon&s;trous plea&s;ure to come; 'tis the &s;weete&s;t place on earth, quite a paradi&s;e, I declare I thought I &s;hould have died with grief at leaving it; papa has been inexorable ever &s;ince to our entreaties for a &s;econd trip, he &s;ays the fir&s;t co&s;t too much mo|ney&mdash;indeed it was an enormous &s;um, only think how much." "I am the wor&s;t per&s;on in the world," &s;aid A|manda, "for gue&s;&s;ing," &s;ick of her impertinent volu|bility, and moving from the window; the evening was fine, and the grounds about the hou&s;e beautiful, &s;he therefore propo&s;ed a walk; at this propo&s;al, the young ladies, who had hitherto been in deep confab, looked at each other, and remained &s;ilent for &s;ome minutes; Mi&s;s Kilcorban, then, who had no notion of gratifying the inclination of her gue&s;t, by the &s;acrifice of her own, &s;aid, "it blew a little, and that her hair would be ruin|ed, and the Marchelle powder blown from it, by &s;uch a walk." Another young lady looking down at her white &s;atin &s;lippers, vowed &s;he would not venture into the gra&s;s for worlds. A third declared when once dre&s;&s;ed &s;he could not bear to be tumbled. Amanda had too much politene&s;s to repeat her wi&s;h, and it was therefore unanimou&s;ly agreed among the fair Coterie, that they &s;hould continue in the drawing room, to be in <HI>&s;tatu quo</HI> for the reappearance of the beaux.</P>
<P>Lady Grey&s;tock now beckoned to our heroine to take a &s;eat by her, &s;he gladly obeyed. "Well, my dear," &s;aid her Lady&s;hip, "I hope you have had enough of the&s;e country mi&s;&s;es, tho&s;e would-be mi&s;&s;es of the ton." Amanda &s;miled a&s;&s;entingly. "Heaven defend me, or any one I like," continued her Lady&s;hip, "from their clack; the confu&s;ion of Babel was, I really believe, in|ferior to that their tongues create: yet &s;ome people have the ab&s;urdity to reckon the&s;e girls accompli&s;hed&mdash;poor Mrs. Kilcorban torments one with the perfections of her daughters; again&s;t they are di&s;po&s;ed of (which &s;he ima|gines will be very &s;oon) &s;he has a new brood of graces

training up to bring out&mdash;mercy on me! what a &s;et of hoydens&mdash;I'd lay my life, at this very in&s;tant, they are gollopping about the nur&s;ery, like a parcel of wild colts, tearing or tormenting an unfortunate French governe&s;s, who was formerly <HI>fille de chambre</HI> to a woman of quali|ty, and does not even under&s;tand the grammatical part of her own language." "Mrs. Kilcorban's opinion of her children," &s;aid Amanda, "is natural, con&s;idering the partiality of a parent." "Yes&mdash;but not more bear|able on that account," replied her lady&s;hip, "and I &s;hould endeavour to open her eyes to her folly, if I thought her acquaintance would forgive my depriving them of &s;uch a fund of amu&s;ement."</P>
<P>Mr. Bryan Kilcorban, with &s;ome gentlemen, now entered the room, and advanced to Amanda. "So," &s;aid he, "you have got by the Dowager, hang me, but I would let my beard grow, if all women re&s;embled her in their di&s;po&s;itions." "By way of appearing &s;agacious I &s;uppo&s;e," &s;aid her lady&s;hip, who was extremely quick, and had caught the la&s;t words; "alas! poor youth, no em|belli&s;hments on the exterior would ever be able to make us believe the tenement within well furni&s;hed;" her la|dy&s;hip was now &s;ummoned to a whi&s;t table, and Mi&s;s Kilcorban immediately took her vacant &s;eat. "My dear creature," &s;aid &s;he, are you bored to death? Lady Grey&s;tock is a queer piece, I can a&s;&s;ure you; I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he was a&s;king &s;ome favour from you, &s;uch as to work her an apron, or handkerchief, &s;he is noted every where for reque&s;ting &s;uch little jobs, as &s;he calls them; indeed we &s;hould never put up with the trouble &s;he gives us, but that &s;he is va&s;tly rich, and papa's relation, and has no one &s;o nearly connected with her as we are." "All very good rea&s;ons for your complai&s;ance," replied Aman|da, "but &s;hould you not be careful in concealing them." "Oh! Lord, no&mdash;every one knows them as well as we do our&s;elves; &s;he was here la&s;t &s;ummer, and took a fan|cy to the pattern of an apron of mine, and made me the rea&s;onable reque&s;t of working one like it for her; all this &s;he pretended was to prevent my being idle. Well I &s;aid I would, and wrote up to the Moravian hou&s;e, in

Dublin, where I had got mine, for one exactly like it; in due time I received it, and pre&s;ented it to the Dowa|ger, certain that in return I &s;hould receive a few of her diamond pins, which &s;he had often heard me admire; they are the prettie&s;t I ever &s;aw, and quite unfit for her, but &s;he had the cruelty to di&s;appoint me." "Upon my faith," cried Mrs. Kilcorban, who had taken a chair at the other &s;ide of Amanda, and li&s;tened with evident plea&s;ure to her daughter's voluble &s;peech, "Lady Grey|&s;tock is an odd being, I never met with any one like her in all my travels through England, Ireland, and Wales; but &s;he is a great orator, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the gift of the gab in a wonderful degree."</P>
<P>Aye indeed, thought Amanda, and you and your fair daughters re&s;emble her in that re&s;pect. After tea &s;he was prevailed on to &s;it down to commerce, but &s;he &s;oon grew as tired of the party as of the game, and lo&s;t on purpo&s;e to be relea&s;ed; &s;he had hoped for a little more chat with lady Grey&s;tock, but her lady&s;hip was pa&s;&s;ion|ately fond of cards, and at all times would have preferred the plea&s;ures of a card table, to the eloquence of a Cicero. Kilcorban, on finding her di&s;engaged, tormented her with ab&s;urd compliments; a challenge to a brag table at length relieved her from his non&s;en&s;e, and &s;he loiter|ed about the card tables till they broke up for &s;upper.</P>
<P>Amanda always expre&s;&s;ed to her father her &s;enti|ments of any company &s;he had been in, and tho&s;e &s;he now delivered on quitting the party, perfectly coincided with his; he laughed at the account which the Kilcor|bans had given of Lady Grey&s;tock, to whom, he knew, they paid the mo&s;t extravagant flattery, in hopes of ob|taining &s;ome of her large fortune.</P>

<P>THE following evening they were engaged at a farmer's; the invitation was given with &s;uch humi|lity, yet pre&s;&s;ed with &s;uch warmth, that they could not avoid accepting it, and accordingly &s;oon after dinner walked to the hou&s;e, which was about a mile from Cas|tle Carberry. It was a low thatched building, every ap|pendage to it be&s;poke neatne&s;s and comfort, it was &s;itu|ated in a beautiful meadow, enclo&s;ed from the road by a hawthorn hedge, and on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide lay an exten|&s;ive common, on which &s;tood the &s;tupendous and vene|rable ruins of an Abbey, called St. Catherine's; they ap|peared a melancholy monument of the power of time o'er &s;trength and grandeur, and while they attracted the ob&s;ervation of the curious, excited a &s;igh in the bo&s;om of &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>The farmer's family con&s;i&s;ted of three daughters and two &s;ons, who were now dre&s;&s;ed in their be&s;t array; they had a&s;&s;embled a number of their neighbours, among whom was a little &s;at prie&s;t, called father O'Gallag|han, con&s;idered the life of every party, and a blind pi|per; the room was &s;mall, and crowded with furniture, as well as company, it was only divided from the kitch|en by a &s;hort pa&s;&s;age, and the &s;team of hot cakes, and the &s;moke of a turf fire, which i&s;&s;ued thence, &s;oon ren|dered it di&s;tre&s;&s;ingly warm. Amanda got as near the window as po&s;&s;ible, but &s;till could not procure &s;ufficient air, and as every thing for tea was not quite ready, a&s;k|ed one of the Mi&s;s O'Flannaghan's if &s;he would accom|pany her to St. Catherine's&mdash;&s;he an&s;wered in the affirma|tive.

&s;ince her entrance, now &s;hook his fat &s;ides, and &s;aid, "he wi&s;hed he could get her initiated there, for it would do my &s;oul good," cried he, to confe&s;s &s;uch a pretty lit|tle creature as you are, though faith, I believe I &s;hould find you like Paddy M'Denough, who u&s;ed to come to confe&s;&s;ion every Ea&s;ter, though the devil a thing the poor man had to confe&s;s about at all, at all; &s;o, &s;ays I to him, Paddy, my jewel, &s;ays I, I believe I mu&s;t make a &s;aint of you, and lay you on the altar." "Oh! honey, father," cried he, "not yet a while, till I get a new &s;uit of clothes on, which I &s;hall by next Michaelmas." Amanda left them all laughing at this &s;tory, and her fa|ther engaged in conver&s;ation with &s;ome farmers, who were de&s;iring his intere&s;t with Lord Cherbury, for new lea&s;es on moderate terms.</P>
<P>Amanda had about a quarter of a mile to walk acro&s;s the common, the ground was mar&s;hy and uneven, and numerous &s;tumps of trees, denoted its having <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> been a noble fore&s;t, of which no memorial but the&s;e &s;tumps, and a few tall trees immediately near the Abbey, re|mained, that &s;tretched their venerable arms around it, as if to &s;hade that ruin who&s;e progre&s;s they had witne&s;|&s;ed, and which Amanda found well worthy of in|&s;pection; &s;he was equally a&s;toni&s;hed at its elegance and extent; with &s;acred awe traver&s;ed &s;pacious cloi&s;ters, the former walks of holy meditation; &s;he pur&s;ued her way through winding pa&s;&s;ages, where ve&s;tiges of cells were yet di&s;cernable, o'er who&s;e mouldering arches the gra&s;s waved in rank luxuriance, and the creeping ivy &s;pread its gloomy foliage, and viewed with reverence the graves of tho&s;e who had once <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">habited them, they &s;urround|ed that of the founder's, which was di&s;tingui&s;hed by a cro&s;s, and Mi&s;s. O'Flannaghan related the traditions that were current concerning him. He was a holy monk who had the care of a pious lady's con&s;cience, &s;he, on her death bed, had a remarkable dream, or vi&s;ion, in which &s;he thought an angel appeared, and charged her to be|queath her wealth to her confe&s;&s;or, who would, no doubt, make a much better u&s;e of it than tho&s;e &s;he de&s;igned it for; &s;he obeyed the &s;acred injunction, and the good

man immediately laid the foundation of this Abbey, which he called after his benefactre&s;s, and to which he and the community he belonged to, removed. The Chapel was roofle&s;s, but &s;till retained many relics of &s;uper&s;titious piety, which had e&s;caped in a tolerable de|gree, both time and weather, &s;aints and martyrs were curiou&s;ly cut over the places where the altars and ci&s;terns for holy water had once &s;tood, to which Amanda pa&s;&s;ed through a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of elegant arches, among which were a number of tomb &s;tones, with curious de|vices, and unintelligible in&s;criptions; half hid in gra&s;s and weeds, on a flag which &s;he perceived mu&s;t have been lately placed there, &s;he &s;aw &s;ome faded flowers &s;trewn, and looking at her companion &s;aw a tear dropping from her on them; &s;he gently a&s;ked the cau&s;e of it, and heard a favourite brother was interred there; the girl moved from the &s;pot, but Amanda, detained by an irrepre&s;&s;ible emotion, &s;taid a minute longer to contemplate the aw|ful &s;cene&mdash;all was &s;ilent, &s;ad, and &s;olitary, the gra&s;s grown a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;les looked long untrodden by human foot, the green and mouldering walls appeared ready to crumble into atoms, and the wind, which howled through their crevices, &s;ounded to the ear of fancy, as &s;ighs of &s;orrow for the de&s;olation of the place; full of moralizing melan|choly, the young, the lovely Amanda, hung over the grave of her companion's youthful brother, and taking up the withered flower, wet with the tear of &s;i&s;terly af|fection, dropped another on it, and cried "oh! how fit an emblem is this of life, how illu&s;trative of the&s;e words;

<P>Mi&s;s O'Flannaghan now led her through &s;ome more windings, when, &s;uddenly emerging from them, &s;he found her&s;elf, to her great &s;urpri&s;e, in a large garden, entirely encompa&s;&s;ed by the ruins, and in the centre of it &s;tood a long low building, which her companion inform|ed her was a convent, a folding door at the &s;ide opened into the chapel, which they entered, and found a nun praying.</P>

Amanda, drew back, fearful of di&s;turbing her, but Mi&s;s O'Flannaghan acco&s;ted her whithout ceremony, and the nun returned the &s;alutation, with the mo&s;t cordial good humour; &s;he was fifty, as Amanda afterwards heard, for &s;he never could, from her appearance, have conceived her to be &s;o much; her &s;kin was fair, and per|fectly free from wrinkle, the bloom and down upon her cheeks as bright and as &s;oft as that upon a peach, though her accent at once proclaimed her country, it was not un|harmonious, and the cheerful obligingne&s;s of her manner amply compen&s;ated the want of elegance; &s;he wore the religious habit of the hou&s;e, which was a loo&s;e flannel dre&s;s, bound round her wai&s;t by a girdle, from which hung her beads and a cro&s;s, a veil of the &s;ame &s;tuff de|&s;cended to the ground, and a mob cap and forehead cloth quite concealed her hair<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The Abbey and the nun, which the Author has at|tempted to de&s;cribe, were &s;uch as &s;he really &s;aw, but in a different part of Ireland from that which &s;he has men|tioned.</HI></NOTE>.

"Ah! my honey," cri|ed &s;he, "I am &s;orry &s;he is come at a time when &s;he'll &s;ee us all in the di&s;mals, for you know we are in mourn|ing for our Priore&s;s (the altar was hung with black); but my dear (turning to Amanda), do you mean to come here next Sunday, for if you do, you will find us all bright again." Upon Amanda's an&s;wering in the negative, &s;he continued, "Faith and I am &s;orry for that, for I have taken a great fancy to you, and when I like a per|&s;on, I always wi&s;h them as great a chance of happine&s;s as I have my&s;elf." Amanda &s;miling, &s;aid &s;he believed none could de&s;ire a greater; and the nun obligingly proceeded to &s;hew her all the relics and finery of the Chapel; among the former was a head belonging to one of the eleven thou&s;and virgin martyrs, and the lat|ter, a che&s;t full of rich &s;ilks, which pious ladies had gi|ven for the purpo&s;e of dre&s;&s;ing the altar; pulling a drawer from under it, &s;he di&s;played a quantity of ar|tificial

They a&s;cended a few &s;teps to the place where the community &s;at, it was divided from the body of the Chapel by &s;light rai&s;ing; here &s;tood the organ, the nun &s;ighed as &s;he looked at it, "poor &s;i&s;ter Agatha," cried &s;he, "we &s;hall never get &s;uch another organi&s;t, &s;he was always fit indeed for the heavenly choir, "oh! my dear," turning to Amanda, "had you known her you would have loved her, &s;he was our late priore&s;s, and elect|ed to that office at twenty nine, which is reckoned an ear|ly age for it, on account of the cleverne&s;s it requires, &s;he had held it but two years when &s;he died, and we were never &s;o comfortable as during her time, &s;he managed &s;o well; the mourning in the chapel, as I have already told you, will be over for her next Sunday, but that which is in our hearts will not be &s;o &s;peedily removed." Mi&s;s O'Flan|naghan now reminded Amanda it was time to return, to which with &s;ecret reluctance &s;he con&s;ented, the nun pre&s;|&s;ed her to &s;tay tea, but on hearing of her engagement only reminded her of the promi&s;ed vi&s;it. In their walk back her companion informed Amanda, that the &s;ociety con&s;i&s;ted of twelve nuns, their little fortunes, though &s;unk in one common fund, were in&s;ufficient to &s;upply their nece&s;&s;ities which compelled them to keep a day &s;chool, in which the neighbouring children were in&s;truct|ed in reading, writing, plain work, embroidery, and arti|ficial flowers; &s;he al&s;o added, that the nuns were allow|ed to go out, but few availed them&s;elves of that liber|ty,
<PB N="191" REF="038416_0190_1011E2EC18C85088">
and that except in fa&s;ting, they were &s;trangers to the au&s;terities practi&s;ed in foreign convents.</P>
<P>For &s;uch a &s;ociety Amanda thought nothing could be better adapted than their pre&s;ent &s;ituation; &s;heltered by the ruins, like the living entombed among the dead, their wi&s;hes, like their views, were bounded by the moulder|ing walls, as no object appeared beyond them which could tempt their wandering from their u&s;ual limits; the dreary common which met the view, could not be more bleak and inho&s;pitable than the world in general would have proved to the children of poverty and nature.</P>
<P>Father O'Gallaghan met the ladies at the door, and, familiarly taking Amanda's hand, &s;aid, "why you have &s;taid long enough to be made a nun of; here (&s;aid he) the cakes are buttered, the tea made, and we all waiting for you, ah! you little rogue," &s;mirking in her face, "by the head of St. Patrick, tho&s;e twinklers of yours were not given for the good of your &s;oul; here you are come to play pell-mell among the hearts of the hone&s;t Iri&s;h lads; ah! the devil a doubt but you will have mi&s;|chief enough to an&s;wer for by and by, and then I &s;up|po&s;e you will be coming to me to confe&s;s and ab&s;olve you, but remember, my little honey, if you do I mu&s;t be paid before hand." Amanda di&s;engaged her hand, and entered the parlour, where the company, by a di&s;|play of pocket handkerchiefs on their laps, &s;eemed pre|pared to make a downright meal of the good things be|fore them; the Mi&s;s O'Flannaghans, from the toils of the tea table, at la&s;t grew as red as the ribbon with which they were profu&s;ely ornamented; the table at length removed, the chairs arranged, and the benches placed in the pa&s;&s;age for the old folks, the &s;ignal for a dance was given, by the piper's playing an Iri&s;h gig, the farmer's elde&s;t &s;on, habited in a new &s;ky blue coat, his hair combed &s;leek on his forehead, and his complex|ion as bright as a full blown poppy, advanced to our heroine, and begged with much mode&s;ty, and many bows, &s;he would do him the favour to &s;tand up with him; &s;he he&s;itated a little, when Father O'Gallaghan giving her a tap, or rather &s;lap on the &s;houlder, made
<PB N="192" REF="038416_0191_1011E2EF5190BC10">
her &s;tart &s;uddenly from her &s;eat; he laughed heartily at this, declaring, he liked to &s;ee a girl alive and merry; as he could not join in the dance, he con&s;oled him&s;elf with being ma&s;ter of the ceremonies, and in&s;i&s;ted on A|manda's dancing and leading off the Prie&s;t in his boots; &s;he felt little inclined to comply, but &s;he was one of tho&s;e who can &s;acrifice their own inclination to that of others; being directed in the figure by the prie&s;t, &s;he went down the dance, but the floor being an earthen one, by the time &s;he concluded it, &s;he begged they would excu&s;e her &s;itting the remainder of the evening, &s;he felt &s;o extremely fatigued; &s;he and Fitzalan would gladly have declined &s;taying &s;upper, but this they found im|po&s;&s;ible, without either greatly mortifying, or ab&s;olutely offending their ho&s;pitable entertainers.</P>
<P>The table was covered with a profu&s;ion of good coun|try fare, and none &s;eemed to enjoy it more truly than the Prie&s;t, in the intervals of eating, his je&s;ts flew about in every direction, the &s;cope he gave to his vivacity ex|hilerated the re&s;t, &s;o that like Fal&s;taff, he was not only witty him&s;elf, but a promoter of wit in others. "Pray, father," &s;aid a young man to him, "what do you give in return for all the good cheer you get?" "My ble&s;|&s;ing to be &s;ure," replied he, "what better could I give?" "Ay, &s;o you may think, but that is not the ca&s;e with us all, I promi&s;e you, 'tis &s;o Pat, I mu&s;t tell you a &s;tory about that &s;ame thing called a Prie&s;t's ble&s;&s;ing.&mdash;A poor man went one day to a prie&s;t, who had the name of being very rich and very charitable, but as all we hear is not go&s;pel, &s;o the poor man doubted a little the truth of the latter report, and re&s;olved on trying him,&mdash;"Father," &s;ays he, "I have met with great lo&s;&s;es, my cabin was burned, my pigs &s;tolen, and my cow fell into a ditch and broke her neck; &s;o I am come to a&s;k your reverence, for the love of heaven, to lend me a crown."&mdash;"A crown," repeated the angry and a&s;toni&s;h|ed prie&s;t, "oh! you rogue, where do you think I could get money to lend, except, like your&s;elf, I had pilfered and &s;tolen." "Oh! that is neither here nor there, replied the man, "you know I cleared the &s;core on my

con&s;cience with you long ago; &s;o tell me, father, if you will lend me a half a crown?" "No, nor a &s;hilling;" "Well, a farthing then, anything from &s;uch a good man as you." "No," &s;aid the prie&s;t, "not a mite." "Mayn't I have your ble&s;&s;ing," then a&s;ked the man? "Oh! that you &s;hall and welcome, replied he, &s;miling. "Why then, father," returned the other, "I would refu&s;e it if you forced it upon me, for d'ye &s;ee, had it been worth one farthing you would have refu&s;ed it to me."</P>
<P>"You have put me in mind of a very curious &s;tory," exclaimed another young man, as this one concluded his. "A young knight went into a chapel in Spain one morning, where he ob&s;erved a monk &s;tanding in a &s;up|plicating attitude, with a box in his hand: he a&s;ked him what this was for, and learned, to collect money for pray|ing the &s;ouls of fifty Chri&s;tians out of purgatory, whom the Moors had murdered; the knight threw a piece of money into the box, and the monk, after repeating a &s;hort prayer, exclaimed, "there is one &s;oul redeemed." The knight threw in a &s;econd, and the prie&s;t, after the &s;ame ceremony, cried, "there is another free." Thus they both went on, one giving and the other praying, till by the monk's account all the &s;ouls were free: "Are you &s;ure of this?" inquired the knight, "Ay," replied the prie&s;t, they are all a&s;&s;embled together at the gate of heaven, which St. Peter gladly opened for them, and they are now joyfully &s;eated in Paradi&s;e. "From whence they cannot be removed, I &s;uppo&s;e," &s;aid the knight. "Removed!" repeated the a&s;toni&s;hed prie&s;t, "no, the world it&s;elf might be ea&s;ier moved." "Then, if you plea&s;e holy father, return me my ducats, they have ac|compli&s;hed the purpo&s;e for which they were given, and as I am only a poor cavalier, without a chance of being as happily &s;ituated, at lea&s;t for &s;ome years, as the &s;ouls we have mutually contributed to relea&s;e, I &s;tand in great need of them."</P>
<P>Fitzalan was &s;urpri&s;ed at the freedom with which they treated the prie&s;t, but he laughed as merrily as the re&s;t at their &s;tories, for he knew that though they &s;ometimes
<PB N="194" REF="038416_0193_1011E2F46F770BF8">
allowed them&s;elves a little latitude, they neither wi&s;hed nor attempted to &s;hake off his power.</P>
<P>Fitzalan and Amanda withdrew as early as po&s;&s;ible from the party, which if it wanted every other charm, had that of novelty, at lea&s;t to them. The next morning Amanda repaired to the Convent, and inquired for &s;i&s;ter Mary, the good natured nun &s;he had &s;een the preceding evening; &s;he immediately made her appearance, and was delighted at &s;eeing Amanda, &s;he conducted her to the &s;chool room, where the re&s;t of the nuns and the pupils were a&s;&s;embled, and Amanda was delighted with the content and regularity which appeared in the &s;ociety, as well as the obliging eagerne&s;s they &s;hewed to gratify her curio&s;ity; they led her through the hou&s;e, which contained a number of apartments, every nun having one to her&s;elf, furni&s;hed with a bed, chair, table, and cruci|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">x, and then to the parlour, where their new Priore&s;s &s;at, &s;he was a woman far advanced in life; had a painter wanted to per&s;onify benevolence, he might have cho&s;en her for a model, &s;o &s;oft, &s;o benignant, was her counte|nance; &s;orrow as well as time had marked it deeply, but the mild expre&s;&s;ion of her eyes announced the mo&s;t per|fect re&s;ignation to that &s;orrow; &s;he received Amanda with the true&s;t politene&s;s and mo&s;t friendly warmth, and Amanda felt impre&s;&s;ed with real reverence for her, whil&s;t &s;he acknowledged in her mind there could not be a happi|er &s;ituation for her than her pre&s;ent, &s;he thought it a pity the world had been deprived of a woman who would have proved &s;uch an ornament to it. Si&s;ter Mary di&s;appear|ed, but returned in a few minutes with cakes and cur|rant wine, which &s;he forced Amanda to take; the good &s;i&s;ter was enchanted with her young vi&s;itor, and having no idea of concealing her feelings, &s;he openly expre&s;&s;ed her admiration.&mdash;"Dear mother," &s;aid &s;he, addre&s;&s;ing the Priore&s;s, "is &s;he not a lovely creature, what pretty eyes &s;he has got, and what &s;weet little hands; oh! if our ble&s;&s;ed Lady would but touch her heart and make her become one of us, I &s;hould be &s;o happy." The Prior|e&s;s &s;miled, &s;he was not &s;o great an enthu&s;ia&s;t as &s;i&s;ter Mary, "it would be a pity," &s;aid &s;he &s;o &s;weet a flow|er
<PB N="195" REF="038416_0194_1011E2F6CDF7BAB8">
&s;hould be hid amid&s;t the ruins of St. Catherine's."</P>
<P>Amanda made an addition to her flowers, &s;he was thanked by the nuns, and entreated to favour them often with a vi&s;it; ju&s;t as &s;he reached Ca&s;tle Carberry &s;he &s;aw the Kilcorban's carriage &s;top at it, from which Lady Grey&s;tock, and the young ladies alighted, they both &s;poke at once, and &s;o extremely fa&s;t, that Amanda &s;carce|ly under&s;tood what they &s;aid; they declared a thou&s;and impertinent vi&s;itors had prevented their coming the pre|ceding morning, and looking at the things &s;he had ob|ligingly promi&s;ed to &s;hew them. Amanda recollected no &s;uch promi&s;e, but would not contradict them and per|mitted their taking what patterns they liked. Lady Grey|&s;tock &s;miled &s;arca&s;tically at her young kin&s; women, and expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h to &s;ee the Ca&s;tle, Amanda led her through it; her lady&s;hip was particularly plea&s;ed with the dre&s;&s;ing room; here the young ladies, with rude and eager curio&s;ity, examined every thing, but her lady&s;hip, who was full as curious as them&s;elves, could not con|demn freedoms &s;he took her&s;elf; ob&s;erving a petticoat in a tambour frame, &s;he admired the pattern, and hear|ing it was de&s;igned by Amanda, extolled her fine ta&s;te, and declared &s;he &s;hould of all things like to have one worked in the &s;ame; this hint was too plain to pa&s;s un|noticed, Amanda wi&s;hed to oblige particularly any one advanced in life, and told her lady&s;hip &s;he would work one for her. Lady Grey&s;tock &s;miled mo&s;t graciou&s;ly at this, and pre&s;&s;ing her hand, declared &s;he was a charming girl. The Mi&s;s Kilcorbans winked &s;lyly, and taking her hand in turn, a&s;&s;ured her they had conceived a mo&s;t ar|dent friend&s;hip for her, and hoped &s;he would often fa|vour them with her company. Amanda an&s;wered the&s;e in&s;incere profe&s;&s;ions with cool civility, and the vi&s;itors departed.</P>

<P>SOLITUDE to Amanda was a luxury, as it afforded her opportunities of indulging the ideas on which her heart delighted to dwell; &s;he yet believed &s;he &s;hould &s;ee Lord Mortimer, and that Lord Cherbury's &s;anctioning their attachment, would remove the delicate &s;cruples of her father. From &s;oothing his pa&s;&s;ing hours, beguiling her own with the accompli&s;hments &s;he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, and indulging the tender &s;ugge&s;tions of hope, a plea&s;ure aro&s;e &s;he thought ill exchanged for the trifling gaiety of the parties &s;he was frequently invited to; &s;he was never at a lo&s;s for amu&s;ement within Ca&s;tle Carber|ry, or about its domain; the garden became the object of her peculiar care, its &s;ituation was romantic, and long neglect had added to its natural wildne&s;s. Amanda, in many places, di&s;covered ve&s;tiges of ta&s;te, and wi&s;hed to re&s;tore all to primeval beauty; the fruit trees were mat|ted together, the alleys gra&s;s grown, and the flowers choaked with weeds; on one &s;ide lay a &s;mall wilderne&s;s, which &s;urrounded a Gothic temple, and on the other green &s;lopes with ma&s;&s;es of naked rock projecting thro' them; a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">light of rugged &s;teps, cut in the living rock, led to a care on the &s;ummit of one of the highe&s;t, a cro&s;s,

rudely carved upon the wall, and the remains of a mat|ted couch, denoted this having formerly been an Her|mitage; it over-hung the &s;ea, and all about it were tre|mendous crags, again&s;t which the waves beat with vio|lence; over a low and arched door was a &s;moo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h &s;tone, with the following lines engraved upon it:&mdash;
<Q><L>The pilgrim oft</L>
<L>At dead of night, 'mid his ori&s;ons hears</L>

<L>Rattling around, loud thundering to the moon.</L>
<BIBL>DYE.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>Under Amanda's &s;uperintending care, the garden &s;oon lo&s;t its rude appearance, a new couch was procured for the Hermitage, which &s;he ornamented with &s;hells and &s;ea weeds, rendering it a mo&s;t delightful rece&s;s, the trees were pruned, the alleys cleared of oppo&s;ing bram|bles, and over the wall of the Gothic temple &s;he hung the flowers &s;he had purcha&s;ed at St. Catherine's in fan|ciful wreaths.</P>
<P>She often a&s;cended the devious path of the mountain, which &s;tretched beyond Ca&s;tle Carberry, and beheld the waves glittering in the &s;un beams, from which its foli|age &s;heltered her. But no vi&s;ionary plea&s;ures, no de|lightful rambles, no dome&s;tic avocations, made her for|getful to the calls of benevolence; &s;he vi&s;ited the haunts of poverty, and relieved its nece&s;&s;ities to the utmo&s;t of her power; the wretchedne&s;s &s;o often con&s;picuous among many of the lower rank, filled her not only with compa&s;&s;ion, but &s;urpri&s;e, as &s;he had imagined that liber|ty and a fruitful &s;oil were generally attended with com|fort and pro&s;perity; her father to whom &s;he communi|cated this idea, informed her that the indigence of the pea&s;ants proceeded, in a great degree, from the emigra|tion of their landlords; "their wealth," &s;aid he, "is &s;pent in foreign lands, in&s;tead of enriching tho&s;e from whence it was drawn; policy &s;hould &s;ometimes induce them to vi&s;it their e&s;tates, the revenue of half a year &s;pent on them would nece&s;&s;arily benefit the poor wretch|es,

<P>"The clouds, which are formed by mi&s;ts and exhala|tions, return to the places from whence they were drawn, in fertalizing &s;howers and refre&s;hing dews, and almo&s;t every plant enriches the &s;oil from which it &s;prung; Na|ture, indeed, in all her works, is a glorious precedent to man, but, while en&s;laved by di&s;&s;ipation, he cannot follow her example, and what exqui&s;ite &s;ources of en|joyment does he lo&s;e&mdash;to lighten the toils of labour, to cheer the child of poverty, to rai&s;e the drooping head of merit!&mdash;oh! how &s;uperior to the revels of di&s;&s;ipa|tion, or the o&s;tentation of wealth.</P>
<P>"Real happine&s;s is for&s;aken for a gaudy phantom cal|led plea&s;ure, &s;he is &s;eldom gra&s;ped but for a moment, yet in that moment has power to fix envenomed &s;tings within the brea&s;t; the heart which delights in dome&s;tic joys, which ri&s;es in pious gratitude to Heaven, which melts at human woe, can alone experience true plea|&s;ure. The fortitude with which the pea&s;ants bear their &s;ufferings, &s;hould cure di&s;content of its murmurs, they &s;upport adver&s;ity without complaining, and tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s a pile of turf again&s;t the &s;everity of winter, a &s;mall &s;trip of ground, planted with cabbage and potatoes, a cow, a pig, and &s;ome poultry, think them&s;elves complete|ly happy, though one wretched hovel &s;helters all alike."</P>
<P>Oh! how rapturous, thought Amanda, the idea of Lord Mortimer's feeling recurring to her mind, to change &s;uch &s;cenes, to &s;ee the clay built hovel vani&s;h, and a dwelling of neatne&s;s and convenience ri&s;e in its &s;tead; to wander, continued &s;he, with him who&s;e &s;oul is fraught with &s;en&s;ibility, and view the projects of be|nevolence, realized by the hand of charity, the faded cheek of mi&s;ery regain the glow of health&mdash;

and content and cheerfulne&s;s &s;port beneath its &s;hades.</P>
<P>From &s;uch an ec&s;tatic reverie as this, Amanda was rou&s;ed one morning, by the entrance of the Kilcorbans
<PB N="6" REF="038416_0199_1011D076CE900318">
and Lady Grey&s;tock, into the dre&s;&s;ing room where &s;he was working, "Oh! my dear," cried the elde&s;t of the young ladies, "we have &s;uch enchanting news to tell you; only think who is coming down here immediately, your uncle, and aunt, and cou&s;in; an expre&s;s came this morning from Dublin, where they now are, to the &s;tew|ard at Ul&s;ter Lodge, to have every thing prepared a|gain&s;t next week for them; "I declare," &s;aid Mi&s;s Ali|cia, "I &s;hall quite envy you the delightful amu&s;ement you will have with them." Amanda blu&s;hed and felt a little confu&s;ed; "you will have no rea&s;on then, I fan|cy," replied &s;he, "for I really do not know them."</P>
<P>"Oh lord!" exclaimed Mrs. Kilcorban, "well, that is very comical, not know your own relations; but perhaps they always lived in Scotland, and you were afraid to cro&s;s the &s;ea to pay them a vi&s;it." "If that was the only fear &s;he had," &s;aid lady Grey&s;tock, with a &s;atirical &s;mile, "&s;he could ea&s;ily have &s;urmounted it; be&s;ides, would it not have held good with re&s;pect to one place as well as another?" "Well, I never thought of that," cried Mrs. Kilcorban: "but pray Mi&s;s, may I a&s;k the rea&s;on why you did not know them by letter?" "It can be of very little con&s;equence to you madam," replied Amanda coolly, "to hear it."</P>
<P>"They &s;ay Lady Euphra&s;ia Sutherland is very accom|pli&s;hed," exclaimed Mi&s;s Kilcorban, "&s;o a corre&s;pond|ence with her would have been delightful: I dare &s;ay you write &s;weetly your&s;elf; &s;o if ever you leave Ca&s;tle Carberry, I beg you will favour me with letters, for of all things I doat on a &s;entimental corre&s;pondence."</P>
<P>"No wonder," &s;aid Lady Grey&s;tock, "you are &s;o particularly well qualified to &s;upport one."</P>
<P>"But, my dear," re&s;umed Mi&s;s Kilcorban, "we are to give the mo&s;t enchanting ball that ever was given in this world: Papa &s;ays, we &s;hall have full liberty to do as we plea&s;e re&s;pecting it." "It will be a trouble&s;ome af|fair, I am afraid," &s;aid Mrs. Kilcorban. "We are to have confectioners and French cooks from Dublin," con|tinued her daughter, without minding this interruption: "every thing is to be quite in &s;tile, and prepared again&s;t

the third night of the Marquis and Marchione&s;s's arri|val; &s;o my dear, you and your papa will hold your&s;elves in readine&s;s for our &s;ummons." Amanda bowed. "My &s;i&s;ter and I are to have dancing dre&s;&s;es from town, but I will not give you an idea of the manner in which we have ordered them to be made; I a&s;&s;ure you, you will be ab&s;olutely &s;urpri&s;ed and charmed, when you &s;ee them:&mdash;all the elegant men in the county will be at our entertainment: I dare&s;ay you will be va&s;tly bu&s;y pre|paring for it."</P>
<P>"Nature &s;aid Lady Grey&s;tock, "has been too boun|teous to Mi&s;s Fitzalan, to render &s;uch preparations nece&s;&s;ary."&mdash;Oh lord!" cried the young ladies, with a to&s;s of their heads, "Mi&s;s Fitzalan is not &s;uch a fool, I &s;uppo&s;e, as to wi&s;h to appear unlike every one el&s;e in her dre&s;s;" but, ri&s;ing with their mamma, and &s;aluting her much more formally than they had done at their en|trance, "&s;he is the be&s;t judge of that."</P>
<P>Fitzalan had never &s;een the Marchione&s;s &s;ince his marriage, nor did he ever again wi&s;h to behold her; the inhumanity with which &s;he had treated her lovely &s;i&s;ter; the malice with which &s;he had augmented her fa|ther's re&s;entment again&s;t that poor &s;ufferer, had &s;o &s;trongly prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his mind with ideas of the &s;elfi&s;h|ne&s;s and implacability of her's, as to excite &s;entiments of di&s;ta&s;te and aver&s;ion for her: he con&s;idered her as the u&s;urper of his children's rights; as acce&s;&s;ary to the death of his adored Malvina, and con&s;equently the author of the agonies he endured&mdash;agonies which time, aided by religion could &s;carcely conquer.</P>

<P>AT the expected time, the Marquis and his family arrived, with great &s;plendor, at Ul&s;ter Lodge, which was immediately crouded with vi&s;itors of the fir&s;t con&s;equence in the county, among whom were the Kil|corbans, who&s;e affluent fortune gave them great re&s;pec|tability. Mr. Kilcorban wi&s;hed, indeed, to be fir&s;t in paying his compliments to the Marquis, who had a bo|rough in his di&s;po&s;al, he was de&s;irous of being returned for; di&s;appointed the la&s;t time he &s;at up as one of the candidates for the county, this was his only chance of entering that hou&s;e he had long been ambitious for a &s;eat in; he knew, indeed his oratorical powers were not very great, often &s;aying, he had not the gift of the gab like many of the honourable gentlemen; but then he &s;hould &s;tamp and &s;tare, and look up to gods and god|de&s;&s;es<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ladies are admitted into the gallery of the Iri&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons.</HI></NOTE>, for their approbation, with the be&s;t of them: and be&s;ides, his being a Member of Parliament, would increa&s;e his con&s;equence, at lea&s;t in the country.</P>
<P>The female part of his family went from Ul&s;ter Lodge to Ca&s;tle Carberry, which they entered with a more con&s;equential air than ever, as if they derived new con&s;equence from the vi&s;it they had been paying; in|&s;tead of flying up to Amanda, as u&s;ual, the young la|dies &s;wam into the room, with what they imagined a mo&s;t bewitching elegance, and making a &s;liding curte&s;y,
<PB N="9" REF="038416_0202_1011D24CFB1624F8">
flung them&s;elves upon a &s;ofa, exactly oppo&s;ite a gla&s;s, and alternately viewed them&s;elves, and pur&s;ued their re|marks on Lady Euphra&s;ia's dre&s;s: "Well, certainly, Alicia," &s;aid Mi&s;s Kilcorban, "I will have a morning gown made in imitation of her Lady&s;hip's; that frill of fine lace about the neck, is the mo&s;t becoming thing in nature; and the pale blue lining &s;weetly adapted for a delicate complexion."&mdash;"I think, Charlotte," cried Mi&s;s Alicia, "I will have my tambour mu&s;lin in the &s;ame &s;tile, but lined with pink to &s;et off the work."</P>
<P>"This aunt of your's, my dear," exclaimed Mrs. Kil|corban, "is really a per&s;onable looking woman enough, and her daughter a pretty little &s;ort of body."</P>
<P>"Oh they are charming creatures," cried both the young ladies, "&s;o elegant, &s;o irre&s;i&s;tibly genteel."</P>
<P>"Your ideas and mine, then," &s;aid lady Grey&s;tock, "differ widely about elegance and irre&s;i&s;tibility, if you a&s;cribe either to the ladies in que&s;tion: Mr. Kilcorban," continued &s;he, turning to Amanda, "feared, I believe, my Lord Marquis would fly acro&s;s the &s;ea in a few hours, and that he might catch him ere he took wing, never cea&s;ed tormenting us, from the time breakfa&s;t was over 'till we entered the carriage, to make ha&s;te, though he might have known it was quite too early for fine folks to be vi&s;ible.</P>
<P>"Well, we po&s;ted off to Ul&s;ter Lodge, as if life and death depended on our di&s;patch; Mr. Kilcorban was u&s;hered into the Marquis's &s;tudy, and we into an empty room, to amu&s;e our&s;elves, if we plea&s;ed, with the portraits of the Marquis's ance&s;tors. Whil&s;t bells in all quarters were tingling&mdash;maids and footmen run|ning up and down &s;tairs, and cats, dogs, monkeys, and parrots, who I found compo&s;ed part of their travel|ing retinue, were &s;cratching, barking, chattering, and &s;creaming in a room contigious to the one we occupied. At length a fine perfumed je&s;&s;amy made his appearance, and &s;aying the ladies were ready to have the honour of receiving us &s;kipt up &s;tairs like an Harlequin. The Marchione&s;s advanced about two &s;teps from her couch to
<PB N="10" REF="038416_0203_1011D25189FE1B00">
receive us, and Lady Euphra&s;ia half ro&s;e from her &s;eat, after contemplating us for a minute, to know whether we were to be con&s;idered as human creatures or not, &s;unk back into her former attitude of elegant l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ngour, and continued her conver&s;ation with a young Nobleman, who has accompanied them from England.</P>
<P>"Well, I hope you will allow he is a divine creature," exclaimed Mi&s;s Kilcorban, in an accent of rapture; "Oh, what eyes he has," cried her &s;i&s;ter, "what an harmoni|ous voice, I really never beheld any one &s;o exqui&s;itely hand&s;ome."</P>
<P>"Lord Mortimer, indeed," &s;aid Lady Grey&s;tock: Amanda &s;tarted, blu&s;hed, turned pale&mdash;panted as if for breath, and &s;tared as if in amazement. "Ble&s;s me, Mi&s;s Fitzalan," a&s;ked her Lady&s;hip, "are you ill?" No, madam," replied Amanda, in a trembling voice, "'tis only&mdash;'tis only a little palpitation of the heart I am &s;ubject to: I have interrupted your Lady&s;hip, pray proceed."&mdash;"Well," continued Lady Grey&s;tock, "I was &s;aying that Lord Mortimer was one of the mo&s;t el|egant and engaging young men I had ever beheld; his expre&s;&s;ive eyes &s;eemed to reprove the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">olly of his fair companion, and her neglect made him doubly a&s;&s;iduous, which to me was a mo&s;t convincing proof of a noble mind."</P>
<P>How did the heart of Amanda &s;well with plea&s;ure, at this warm eulogium on Lord Mortimer; the tear of delight, of refined affection, &s;prung to her eye, and could &s;carcely be prevented falling.</P>
<P>"Lord madam," cried Mi&s;s Kilcorban, who&s;e pride was mortified at Amanda's hearing of the cool reception they had met with; "I can't conceive the rea&s;on you a&s;cribe &s;uch rudene&s;s and conceit to Lady Eaphra&s;ia: 'tis really quite a mi&s;con&s;truction of the etiquette nece&s;|&s;ary to be ob&s;erved by people of rank."</P>
<P>"I am glad, my dear," replied Lady Grey&s;tock, "you are now beginning to profit by the many le&s;&s;ons I have given you on humility."</P>
<P>"I a&s;&s;ure you Mi&s;s," &s;aid Mrs. Kilcorban, "I did not forget to tell the Marchione&s;s &s;he had a niece in the
<PB N="11" REF="038416_0204_1011D2531E227658">
neighbourhood: I thought, indeed, &s;he &s;eemed a little &s;hy on the &s;ubject, &s;o I &s;uppo&s;e there has been a differ|ence in the families, particularly as you don't vi&s;it her; but at our ball, perhaps, every thing may be &s;ettled." Amanda made no reply to this &s;peech, and the ladies departed.</P>
<P>Her bo&s;om, as may well be &s;uppo&s;ed, was agitated with the mo&s;t violent perturbations, on hearing of Lord Mortimer's being in the neighbourhood; the plea&s;ure &s;he felt at the fir&s;t intelligence, gradually &s;ub&s;ided, on reflecting he was an inmate, probably a friend of tho&s;e relations, who had contributed to the de&s;truction of her mother; and who, from the character &s;he had heard of them, it was not uncharitable to think, would feel no great regret, if her children experienced a de&s;tiny equally &s;evere, might they not imbibe &s;ome prejudices again&s;t her into his bo&s;om; to know &s;he was the child of the unfortunate Malvina, would be enough to provoke their enmity; or if they were &s;ilent, might not lady Euphra|&s;ia, adorned, with every advantage of rank and fortune, have won, or at lea&s;t &s;oon win, his affections.</P>
<P>Yet &s;carcely did the&s;e ideas obtrude, 'ere &s;he reproach|ed her&s;elf for them, as injurious to Lord Mortimer, from who&s;e noble nature &s;he thought &s;he might believe his con&s;tancy never would be &s;haken, except &s;he her&s;elf gave him rea&s;on to relinqui&s;h it.</P>
<P>She now cheered her de&s;ponding &s;pirits, by recalling the ideas &s;he had long indulged with delight, as her re&s;i|dence was &s;till a &s;ecret to the Edwins, who&s;e letters to their daughter were, by Fitzalans orders, con&s;tantly di|rected to a di&s;tant town from whence her's, in return, were &s;ent; &s;he concluded chance had informed Lord Mortimer of it, and flattered her&s;elf, that to avoid the &s;u&s;picion which a &s;olitary journey to Ireland might create in the mind of Lord Cherbury, he had availed him&s;elf of the Marquis's party, and come to try whether &s;he was unchanged, and her father would &s;anction their attach|ment, 'ere he avowed it to the Earl.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t fluctuating between hope and fear, Ellen, all pale and breathle&s;s, ran into the room, exclaiming, "He
<PB N="12" REF="038416_0205_1011D25618A59DB8">
is come! he is come! Lord Mortimer is come."</P>
<P>"Oh heavens!" &s;ighed Amanda, &s;inking back in her chair, and dropping her trembling hands before her El|len alarmed, blamed her&s;elf for her precipitation, and fly|ing to a cabinet, &s;natched a bottle of lavender water from it, which &s;he plentifully &s;prinkled over her, and then a&s;|&s;i&s;ted her to a window. "I was &s;o flurried," cried the good natured girl, as &s;he &s;aw her mi&s;tre&s;s recovering, "I did not know what I was about; heaven knows, the &s;ight of poor Chip him&s;elf could not have given me more plea&s;ure; I was cro&s;&s;ing the hall when I &s;aw his Lord|&s;hip alighting, and to be &s;ure, if one of the old warriors had &s;tept out of his niche, and the te&s;il take them all, I &s;ay, for they grin &s;o horribly, they frighten me out of my wits, if I go through the hall of a dark evening; &s;o if one of them old fellows, as I was &s;aying had jumped out, I could not have peen more &s;tartled, and pack I ran into the little parlour, and there I heard his Lord&s;hip enquir|ing for my ma&s;ter; to be &s;ure the &s;ound of his voice did my heart good, for he is an old friend, as one may &s;ay; &s;o as &s;oon as he went into the &s;tudy, I &s;tole up &s;tairs; and one may gue&s;s what he and my ma&s;ter are talking apout, I think."</P>
<P>The emotion of Amanda increa&s;ed: &s;he trembled &s;o &s;he could not &s;tand: &s;he felt as if her de&s;tiny, her future happine&s;s, depended on this minute. In vain &s;he endea|voured to regain compo&s;ure; her &s;pirits were wound up to the highe&s;t pitch of expectation, and the agitations in&s;eparable from &s;uch a &s;tate, were not to be repre&s;t.</P>
<P>She continued near an hour in this &s;ituation, when the voice of Mortimer &s;truck her ear; &s;he &s;tarted up, and &s;tanding in the centre of the room, &s;aw him walking down the lawn with her father, who le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t him when he had reached the gate, where his &s;ervants and hor&s;es were. The chill of di&s;appointment pervaded the heart of Amanda, and a &s;hower of tears fell from her. Ellen, who had remained in the room, was almo&s;t as much di&s;|appointed as her mi&s;tre&s;s; &s;he muttered &s;omething about the incon&s;tancy of men; they were all, for her part, &s;he p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lieved, all alike; all like Mr. Chip, captious on every
<PB N="13" REF="038416_0206_1011D257D9598468">
occa&s;ion. The dinner bell now &s;ummoned Amanda; &s;he dried her eyes, and tied on a little &s;traw hat, to con|ceal their redne&s;s. With much confu&s;ion &s;he appeared before her father; his penetrating eye was in&s;tantly &s;truck with her agitation and pallid looks, and he con|jectured &s;he knew of the vi&s;it he had received; on re|ceiving that vi&s;it, he wondered not at the &s;trength of her attachment; the noble and ingenuous air of Lord Mor|timer, had immediately prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Fitzalan in his fa|vour; he &s;aw him adorned with all tho&s;e perfections which are calculated to make a &s;trong and permanent impre&s;&s;ion on a heart of &s;en&s;ibility, and he gave a &s;igh to the cruel nece&s;&s;ity which compelled him to &s;eparate two beings of &s;uch congenial loveline&s;s; but as that ne|ce&s;&s;ity neither was or could be overcome, he rejoiced that Lord Mortimer, in&s;tead of vi&s;iting him on account of his daughter, had merely come on account of affairs relative to the ca&s;tle, and had inquired for her with a coolne&s;s which &s;eemed to declare his love totally &s;ubdued; not the &s;malle&s;t hint relative to the letter, in which he had propo&s;ed for, her, dropt from him; and Fitzalan con|cluded, his affections were transferred to &s;ome object, more the favourite of fortune, than his portionle&s;s Amanda.</P>
<P>This object, he was inclined to believe Lady Euphra|&s;ia Sutherland, from what Lord Cherbury had &s;aid, con|cerning the &s;plendid alliance he had in view for his &s;on, and from Lord Mortimer's accompanying the Ro&s;line family to Ireland.</P>
<P>He felt he had not fortitude to mention tho&s;e conjec|tures to Amanda; he rather wi&s;hed &s;he &s;hould imbibe them from her own ob&s;ervation, and pride, he then tru&s;t|ed would come to her aid, and &s;timulate her to overcome her attachment. Dinner pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ilence; when the &s;ervant was withdrawn, he re&s;olved to relieve the anxiety which her looks informed him pre&s;t upon her heart, by mentioning the vi&s;it of Lord Mortimer; he came, he told her, merely to &s;ee the &s;tate the ca&s;tle was in, and thus proceeded: "Lord Mortimer is, indeed, an ele|gant
<PB N="14" REF="038416_0207_1011D25D1B8CBC00">
and &s;en&s;ible young man, and will do honour to the hou&s;e from whence he is de&s;cended: he had long wi&s;hed, he told me, to vi&s;it this e&s;tate, which was endeared to him by the remembrance of his juvenile days; but par|ticularly by its being the place of his mother's nativity, and her favourite re&s;idence, and the opportunity of tra|velling with an agreeable party, had determined him no longer to defer gratifying this wi&s;h.</P>
<P>"He mentioned his mother in terms of the true&s;t re|&s;pect and tenderne&s;s, and his &s;oftened voice, his tearful eye, proclaimed his heart the man&s;ion of &s;en&s;ibility; his virtues, like his prai&s;es, will do honour to her memo|ry. He had been told the ca&s;tle was in a very ruinous &s;tate, and was agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed to find it in as good order as could be expected, from its ancient date. He de&s;ired to &s;ee the garden, which had been laid out under the direction of his mother; he expected not to have found a ve&s;tage of her ta&s;te remaining, and was con&s;e|quently charmed to find him&s;elf mi&s;taken; every &s;pot appeared to remind him of &s;ome happy hour, e&s;pecially the Gothic temple; how many happy minutes have I pa&s;|&s;ed in this place, &s;aid his Lord&s;hip, after a &s;ilence for &s;ome time, with the be&s;t of women. Upon my word, Amanda," continued Fitzalan, "you have ornamented it in a very fanciful manner; I really thought his Lord|&s;hip would have &s;tolen &s;ome of your lilies or ro&s;es, he ex|amined them &s;o accurately." Amanda blu&s;hed, and her father &s;till perceiving expectation in her eyes, thus went on: "His Lord&s;hip looked at &s;ome of the adjacent grounds, and as he has mentioned what improvements he thought nece&s;&s;ary to be made in then, I fancy he will not repeat his vi&s;it or &s;tay much longer in the king|dom."</P>
<P>In a few minutes after this conver&s;ation, Fitzalan re|paired to his library, and Amanda to the garden; &s;he ha&s;tened to the temple&mdash;never had &s;he before thought it &s;o picture&s;que, or &s;uch an addition to the land&s;cape; the &s;ilence of Lord Mortimer, on entering it, &s;he did not, like her father, believe proceeded altogether from retra|cing &s;cenes of former happine&s;s with his mother: no,
<PB N="15" REF="038416_0208_1011D25EAC50AA60">
&s;aid &s;he, in this &s;pot he al&s;o, perhaps, thought of A|manda.</P>
<P>True, he had mentioned her with indifference to her father, but that might (and &s;he would flatter her&s;elf it did) proceed from re&s;entment, excited by her precipi|tate flight from Wales, at a period when his received addre&s;&s;es gave him a right to information about all her actions; and by her total neglect of him &s;ince; their fir&s;t interview, &s;he tru&s;ted, would effect a reconciliation, by producing an explanation; her father then, &s;he flat|tered her&s;elf, tender as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e was, depending on her hap|pine&s;s, and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in Lord Mortimer's favour, would no longer oppo&s;e their attachment, but allow Lord Cherbury to be informed of it, who, &s;he doubted not, would in this, as well as every other in&s;tance, prove him&s;elf truly feeling and di&s;intere&s;ted.</P>
<P>Thus did Amanda, by encouraging ideas agreeable to her wi&s;hes, try to &s;often the di&s;appointment &s;he had ex|perienced in the morning. Fitzalen, on meeting his daughter at tea, was not &s;urpri&s;ed to hear &s;he had been in the Gothic temple, but he was to &s;ee her wear &s;o cheer|ful an appearance; he was no &s;tranger to the human heart, and he was convinced &s;ome flattering illu&s;ion could alone have enabled her to &s;hake off the &s;adne&s;s with which, but an hour before, &s;he had been oppre&s;t; the &s;ooner &s;uch an illu&s;ion was removed, the better: and to allow her to &s;ee Lord Mortimer, he imagined would be the mo&s;t effectual mea&s;ure for &s;uch a purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The more he reflected on that young nobleman's man|ner, and what he him&s;elf had heard from Lord Cherbury&punc; the more he was convinced Lady Euphra&s;ia Sutherland was not only the object de&s;tined for Lord Mortimer, but the one who now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his affections; and be|lieved his vi&s;it to Ca&s;tle Carberry had been purpo&s;ely made, to announce the alteration of his &s;entiments by the coldne&s;s of his conduct, and check any hopes which his appearance in the neighbourhood might have created.</P>
<P>He had he&s;itated about Amanda's accepting the invi|tation to the Kilcorban's ball, but he now determined &s;he &s;hould go, impre&s;t with the idea of her being there
<PB N="16" REF="038416_0209_1011D261E6583538">
convinced of the change in Lord Mortimer's &s;entiments, a conviction he deemed nece&s;&s;ary to produce one in her own.</P>
<P>Amanda impatiently longed for this night, which &s;he believed would reali&s;e either her hopes or &s;ears.</P>

<P>THE wi&s;hed for night at lenght arrived, and Amanda arrayed her&s;elf for it with a fluttering heart; the reflection of her mirror did not depre&s;s her &s;pirits: hope had increa&s;ed the brilliancy of her eyes, and given and additional glow to her complexion. El|len, who delighted in the charms of her dear young la|dy, declared, many of the Iri&s;h ladies would have rea|&s;on to envy her that night; and Fitzalan, when he en|tered the parlour was &s;truck with her &s;urpa&s;&s;ing loveli|ne&s;s; he gazed on her with a rapture that brought tears into his eyes, and felt a &s;ecret pride at the idea of the Marchione&s;s beholding this &s;weet de&s;cendant of her neglected &s;i&s;ter's:
<Q><L>Into &s;uch beauty &s;pread, and blown &s;o fair,</L>
<L>Tho' poverty's cold wind, and cru&s;hing rain</L>
<L>Beat keen and heavy on her tender years.</L></Q></P>
<P>"No," &s;aid he to him&s;elf, "the titled Euphra&s;ia, if &s;he equals, cannot at lea&s;t &s;urpa&s;s my Amanda; meek|ne&s;s

and innocence dwell upon the brow of my child&mdash;but the haughty Marchione&s;s will teach pride to lower upon Lady Euphra&s;ia."</P>
<P>Amanda, on reaching Grangeville, found the avenue full of carriages; the lights di&s;per&s;ed through the hou&s;e, gave it quite the appearance of an illumination; it &s;eemed indeed the man&s;ion of gaiety and &s;plendour; her knees trembled as &s;he a&s;cended the &s;tairs, &s;he wi&s;h|ed for time to compo&s;e her&s;elf, but the door opened, her name was announced, and Mrs. Kilcorban came forward to receive her. The room, though &s;pacious, was ex|tremely crouded; it was decorated in a fanciful manner with fe&s;toons of flowers, intermingled with variegated lamps; immediately over the entrance was the orche&s;tra, and oppo&s;ite to it &s;at the Marchione&s;s, and her party. The heart of Amanda beat if po&s;&s;ible, with increa&s;ed quickne&s;s, on the approach of Mrs. Kilcorban, and her voice was lo&s;t in her emotions; recollecting, however, that the &s;crutinizing eyes of Lord Mortimer, and her imperious relations were now on her, &s;he almo&s;t immedi|ately recovered compo&s;ure, and with her u&s;ual elegance, walked up the room. Mo&s;t of the company were &s;tran|gers to her, and &s;he heard a general buzz of "Who is &s;he?" accompanied with expre&s;&s;ions of admiration from the gentlemen, among whom were the officers of a gar|ri&s;on town near Grangeville. Confu&s;ed by the notice &s;he attracted, &s;he ha&s;tened to the fir&s;t &s;eat &s;he found va|cant, which was near the Marchione&s;s.</P>
<P>Univer&s;al, indeed, was the admiration &s;he had excited among the male part of the company, by her beauty, unaffected graces, and &s;implicity of dre&s;s.</P>

a &s;eat, her confu&s;ion &s;ub&s;ided: &s;he looked up, and the fir&s;t eyes &s;he met, were tho&s;e of Lord Mortimer (who leaned on Lady Euphra&s;ia Sutherland's chair) fa&s;tened on her face with a &s;crutinizing earne&s;tne&s;s, as if he wi&s;hed to penetrate the rece&s;&s;es of her heart, and di&s;cover whether he yet retained a place in it; &s;he blu&s;h|ed, and looking from him, perceived &s;he was an object of critical attention to the Marchione&s;s and Lady Euphra|&s;ia; there was a malignant expre&s;&s;ion in their counte|nances, which ab&s;olutely &s;hocked her; and &s;he felt a &s;en&s;ation of horror at beholding the former, who had &s;o largely contributed to the &s;orrows of her mother. "Can it be po&s;&s;ible," &s;aid Lady Euphra&s;ia, replying to a young and elegant officer who &s;tood by her, in a tone of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and with an impertinent &s;neer, "that you think her hand&s;ome?" "Hand&s;ome!" exclaimed he with warmth, as if involuntarily repeating her Lady&s;hip's word, "I think her bewitchingly irre&s;i&s;tible; they told me I was coming to the land of &s;aints;" but glancing his &s;parkling eyes around, and fixing them on Amanda, "I find it's the land of godde&s;&s;es."</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s haughtily frowned&mdash;Lady Euphra|&s;ia &s;miled &s;atirically, to&s;&s;ed her head, and played with her fan: the propen&s;ities to envy and ill-nature, which the Marchione&s;s had &s;hewn in her youth were not le&s;s vi&s;ible in age; as they were then excited on her own account, &s;o were they now on her daughter's, to engro&s;s prai&s;e and admiration for her, &s;he wi&s;hed beauty bla&s;ted, and merit extirpated; nor did &s;he ever fail, when in her power, to depreciate one, and ca&s;t an invidious cloud of calumny over the other. She beheld Amanda with envy and hatred, notwith&s;tanding her partiality to her daugh|ter, &s;he could not avoid &s;eeing her va&s;t inferiority in point of per&s;onal charms, to her young relation. True, Lady Euphra&s;ia po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a fortune, which would always en&s;ure her attention, but it was that unimpa&s;&s;ioned and &s;tudied attention &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s dictates, the mere tribute of flattery. How different from the &s;pontaneous attention which Amanda excited, who though portionle&s;s and un|titled
<PB N="19" REF="038416_0212_1011D26B6AE58588">
was beheld with admiration, followed with prai&s;e, and courted with a&s;&s;iduity.</P>
<P>Lady Euphra&s;ia's mind was the counter-part of her mother's; but in her figure &s;he re&s;embled her father; her &s;tature was low, and her features contracted, and though of the &s;ame age as Amanda, her har&s;h expre&s;|&s;ion made her appear much older; though ble&s;&s;ed with the abundant gifts of fortune, &s;he was unhappy, if, from any one's manner, &s;he conceived that they thought na|ture had not been quite &s;o liberal to her. In the dome|&s;tic circle, con&s;tant flattery kept her in good humour; but when out, &s;he was frequently chagrined at &s;eeing women infinitely below her in rank and fortune, more noticed than her&s;elf.</P>
<P>At the ball &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he &s;hould have appeared as little le&s;s, at lea&s;t, than a demi godde&s;s; art and fa&s;hi|on were exhau&s;ted in adorning her, and &s;he entered the room with all the in&s;olence of con&s;cious rank and affect|ation of beauty. As &s;he walked &s;he appeared &s;carcely able to &s;upport her delicate frame, and her langui&s;hing eyes were half clo&s;ed. She could however &s;ee there was a number of pretty women pre&s;ent, and felt di&s;concert|ed: the re&s;pect however which &s;he was paid, a little re|vived her; and having contrived to detain Lord Morti|mer by her chair, and Sir Charles Bingley, the young officer already mentioned, who was a Colonel of a regi|ment quartered in an adjacent town; &s;he &s;oon felt her &s;pirits uncommonly exhilerated, by the attentions of two of the mo&s;t elegant men in the room: and like a proud &s;ultan, in the mid&s;t of her &s;laves, was enjoy|ing the compliments &s;he extorted from them by her prefatory &s;peeches. When the door opened, and Amanda, like an angel of light appeared, to di&s;&s;olve the mi&s;ts of vanity and &s;elf importance, Lord Mortimer was &s;ilent, but his &s;peaking eyes confe&s;&s;ed his feelings. Sir Charles Bingley, who had no &s;ecret motive for con|cealing his, openly avowed his admiration, to which Lady Euphra&s;ia replied, as has been already mentioned.</P>
<P>All the rapture Sir Charles expre&s;&s;ed, Lord Mortimer felt; his &s;oul &s;eemed on the wing to fly to Amanda, to
<PB N="20" REF="038416_0213_1011D26D3561B5E0">
utter its feelings, to di&s;cover her's, and chide her for her conduct. This fir&s;t emotion of tenderne&s;s, howe|ver, quickly &s;ub&s;ided, on recollecting what that conduct had been&mdash;how cruelly, how ungratefully &s;he had u&s;ed him:&mdash;&s;led in the very moment of hope and expectation, leaving him a prey to di&s;tru&s;t, anxiety and regret: he dreaded &s;ome fatal my&s;tery, &s;ome improper attachment, (experience had rendered him &s;u&s;picious) which neither &s;he nor her father could avow: for never did he imagine that the &s;crupulous delicacy of Fitzalan alone had effect|ed their &s;eparation; he &s;till adored Amanda; he neither could or de&s;ired to drive her from his thoughts, except well a&s;&s;ured &s;he was unworthy of being harboured in them, and felt unutterable impatience to have her my&s;|terious conduct explained. From Tudor Hall he had repaired to London, re&s;tle&s;s and unhappy; &s;oon after his arrival there, the Marquis propo&s;ed his accompanying him to Ireland; this he declined, having rea&s;on to think Lord Cherbury meditated an alliance for him with his family. The Earl expre&s;&s;ed regret at his refu&s;al; he &s;aid he wi&s;hed he would join the Marquis's party, as he wanted his opinion relative to the &s;tate of Ca&s;tle Car|berry, where a man of integrity then re&s;ided; who would have any alterations or repairs he might think ne|ce&s;&s;ary, executed in the mo&s;t elegant manner. He mentioned the name of Fitzalan; Lord Mortimer was &s;urpri&s;ed and agitated; he concealed his emotions, how|ever, and with apparent carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, a&s;ked a few que&s;|tions about him, and found that he was indeed the fa|ther of Amanda: &s;he was not mentioned, nor did he dare to enquire concerning her; but he immediately de|clared, that &s;ince his father wi&s;hed it &s;o much, he would accompany the Marquis. This was extremely plea&s;ing to that nobleman as he and Lord Cherbury had, in re|ality, agreed upon an union between him and Lady Eu|phra&s;ia, and meant, &s;oon, openly to avow their intention. Lord Mortimer &s;u&s;pected, and Lady Euphra&s;ia was al|ready appri&s;ed of it, and from vanity was plea&s;ed at the idea of being connected with a man &s;o univer&s;ally ad|mired:
<PB N="21" REF="038416_0214_1011D27249C079A8">
love was out of the que&s;tion, for &s;he had not &s;ufficient &s;en&s;ibility to experience it.</P>
<P>He, cautious of creating hopes, which he never meant to realize, treated her only with the attention which common politene&s;s demanded, and on every occa&s;ion &s;eemed to prefer the Marchione&s;s's conver&s;ation to her's, intending, by this conduct, to cru&s;h the projected &s;cheme, in embrio, and &s;pare him&s;elf the mortification of openly rejecting it; had his heart even been di&s;engaged, lady Euphra&s;ia could never have been his choice: if Amanda, in reality proved as amiable as he had once rea&s;on to be|lieve her, he con&s;idered him&s;elf bound, by every tie of honour, as well as love, to fulfil the engagement he had entered into with her. He re&s;olved, however, to re&s;i&s;t every plea of tenderne&s;s in her favour, except he was thoroughly convinced &s;he &s;till de&s;erved it; he went to Ca&s;tle Carberry, purpo&s;ely to make a di&s;play of indif|ference, and prevent any ideas being entertained of his having followed her to Ireland; he deemed him&s;elf ju&s;|tifiable in touching her &s;en&s;ibility, (if indeed &s;he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed any for him) by an appearance of coldne&s;s and inattention; but determined after a little retaliation of this kind on her, for the pain &s;he had made him endure, to come to an explanation, and be guided by its re&s;ult, relative to his conduct in future to her.</P>
<P>The character of a perfect &s;tranger was the one he was to &s;upport throughout the evening; but her loveli|ne&s;s, and the gallantry of Sir Charles Bingley, tempted him, a thou&s;and times to break through the re&s;traint he had impo&s;ed on him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s and Lady Euphra&s;ia were not the only per&s;ons di&s;plea&s;ed by the charms of Amanda; the Mi&s;s Kilcorbans &s;aw, with evident mortification, them|&s;elves with chiefly engro&s;&s;ing; their di&s;appointment was doubly &s;evere, after the pain, trouble and expence they had undergone, in ornamenting their per&s;ons:&mdash;after the &s;ugge&s;tions of their vanity, and the flattering encomiums of their mamma, who pre&s;ided her&s;elf at
<PB N="22" REF="038416_0215_1011D276E94961B8">
their toilet, every moment exclaiming, "Well, well, heaven help the men to night, girls."</P>
<P>They fluttered acro&s;s the room to Amanda, &s;weeping at lea&s;t two yards of painted tiffany after them: a&s;&s;ured her they were extremely glad to &s;ee her, but were afraid &s;he was unwell, as &s;he never looked &s;o ill. Amanda a&s;|&s;ured them &s;he was con&s;cious of no indi&s;po&s;ition, and the harmony of her features remained undi&s;turbed. Mi&s;s Kilcorban, in a half whi&s;per, declared the Marchione&s;s had never &s;miled &s;ince &s;he had entered the room. and feared her mamma had committed a great mi&s;take in in|viting them together. The rudene&s;s of this &s;peech &s;hocked Amanda: an indignant &s;well heaved her bo&s;om, and &s;he was about replying to it as it de&s;erved, when Mi&s;s Alicia &s;topt her, by prote&s;ting, &s;he believed Lord Mortimer dying for Lady Euphra&s;ia. Amanda invo|luntarily rai&s;ed her eyes at this &s;peech, but in&s;tead of Lord Mortimer, beheld Sir Charles Bingley, who was &s;tanding behind the young ladies. "Am I pardonable," cried he, &s;miling, "for di&s;turbing &s;o charming a trio; but a &s;oldier is taught never to neglect a good opportu|nity, and one &s;o propitious as the pre&s;ent for the wi&s;h of my heart, might not again offer." The Mi&s;s Kilcorbans bridled up at this &s;peech; played their fans, and &s;miled mo&s;t graciou&s;ly on him, certainly concluding he meant to engage one or other for the fir&s;t &s;et; pa&s;&s;ing gently between them, he bowed gracefully to Amanda, and re|que&s;ted the honour of her hand; &s;he gave an a&s;&s;enting &s;mile, and he &s;eated him&s;elf be&s;ide her, 'till the dancing commenced; the &s;i&s;ters ca&s;t a malignant glance over them, and &s;wam off with a contemptuous indifference.</P>
<P>Lady Euphra&s;ia had expected Sir Charles and Lord Mortimer would have been competitors for her hand, and was infinitely provoked by the de&s;ertion of the form|er to her lovely cou&s;in; he was a fa&s;hionable and ani|mated young man, whom &s;he had often honoured with her notice in England, and wi&s;hed to enli&s;t in the train of her &s;uppo&s;ed adorers. Lord Mortimer could &s;carcely re&s;tore her good humo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r by engaging her. Almo&s;t im|mediately after him young Milcorban advanced, for the
<PB N="23" REF="038416_0216_1011D031D3611EE0">
&s;ame purpo&s;e, and Lord Mortimer &s;incerely regretted he had been beforehand with him. The little fop was quite chagrined at finding her lady&s;hip engaged, but en|treated the next &s;et he might have the &s;upreme honour, and ec&s;tatic felicity, of her hand; this, with the mo&s;t impertinent affectation, &s;he promi&s;ed if able to endure the fatigue of another dance.</P>
<P>Amanda was next couple to Lady Euphra&s;ia, and en|deavoured, therefore, to calm her &s;pirits, which the rude|ne&s;s of Mi&s;s Kilcorban had di&s;compo&s;ed, and attend to the lively conver&s;ation of Sir Charles, who was extreme|ly plea&s;ing and entertaining. Lord Mortimer watched them with jealous attention; his wandering glances were &s;oon noticed by Lady Euphra&s;ia, and her frowns and &s;arca&s;tic &s;peeches evinced her di&s;plea&s;ure at them. He tried to recollect him&s;elf, and act as politene&s;s re|quired; &s;he, not &s;atisfied with fixing his attention, en|deavoured to attract Sir Charles's; &s;he &s;poke to him acro&s;s Amanda, but all her efforts were here ineffectual; he &s;poke and laughed with her lady&s;hip, but his eyes could not be withdrawn from the angelic countenance of his partner. Amanda's hand trembled, as in turning &s;he pre&s;ented it to Lord Mortimer; but though he ex|tended his, he did not touch it; there was a &s;light in this, which pierced Amanda's heart; &s;he &s;ighed, uncon&s;cious of doing &s;o to her&s;elf: not &s;o Sir Charles; he a&s;ked her, &s;miling, to where, or whom, that &s;igh was wafted. This made Amanda recall her wandering thoughts; &s;he a&s;|&s;umed an air of &s;prightline&s;s, and went down the dance with much animation. When fini&s;hed, Sir Charles led her to a &s;eat near the one Lady Euphra&s;ia and Lord Mortimer occupied; &s;he &s;aw the eyes of his lord&s;hip of|ten directed towards her, and her heart fluttered at the plea&s;ing probability of being a&s;ked to dance by him. Sir Charles regretted that the old fa&s;hioned cu&s;tom of not changing partners was over, and declared he could not leave her, 'till &s;he had promi&s;ed him her hand for the third &s;et: this &s;he could not refu&s;e, and he left her with reluctance, (as the gentlemen were again &s;tanding up) to &s;eek a partner. At the &s;ame moment Lord Mortimer
<PB N="24" REF="038416_0217_1011D27B6B5DBEE0">
quitted lady Euphra&s;ia: oh! how the bo&s;om of Amanda throb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, when &s;he &s;aw him approach and look at her; he pau&s;ed&mdash;a fainti&s;hne&s;s came over her&mdash;he ca&s;t another glance on her, and pa&s;&s;ed on;&mdash;her eye followed him, and &s;he &s;aw him take out Mi&s;s Kilcorban.</P>
<P>This, indeed, was a di&s;appointment; propriety, &s;he thought, demanded his dancing the fir&s;t &s;et with Lady Euphra&s;ia, but if not totally indifferent, &s;urely he would not have neglected engaging her for the &s;econd: "Yes," &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf, "he has totally forgotten me: Lady Euphra&s;ia is now the object, and he only pays attention to tho&s;e who can contribute to her amu&s;ement." Seve|ral gentlemen endeavoured to prevail on her to dance, but &s;he pleaded fatigue, and &s;at &s;olitary in a window, apparently regarding the gay a&s;&s;embly, but in reality, too much engro&s;&s;ed by painful thoughts to do &s;o. The woods&punc; &s;ilvered by the beams of the moon, recalled the venerable &s;hades of Tudor Hall to memory, where &s;he had &s;o often rambled by the &s;ame pale beams, and heard vows of unchangeable regard&mdash;vows regi&s;tered in her heart, yet now without the hope of having them fulfil|led. The dancing over, the company repaired to ano|ther room for refre&s;hments. Amanda, ab&s;orbed in thought, heeded not their almo&s;t total de&s;ertion, till young Kilcorban, capering up to her, declared &s;he looked as lone&s;ome as a hermit in his cell, and laughing in her face, turned off with carele&s;s impertinence; he had not noticed her before that night: he was indeed one of tho&s;e little Fluttering in&s;ects, who ba&s;k in the rays of fortune, and court alone her favourites; elated by an acquaintance with the Marchione&s;s and Lady Euphra&s;ia, he particu|larly neglected Amanda, not only from deeming them more worthy of his attention, but from perceiving he could take no &s;tep more certain of gaining their favour. His words made Amanda &s;en&s;ible of the &s;ingularity of her &s;ituation; &s;he aro&s;e immediately, and went to the other room. Every &s;eat was already occupied; near the door &s;at Lady Euphra&s;ia and the Mi&s;s Kilcorbans; Lord Mortimer leaned on the back of her Lady&s;hip's chair, and young Kilcorban occupied one by her &s;ide, which
<PB N="25" REF="038416_0218_1011D27D008F4B98">
he never attempted offering to Amanda; &s;he &s;tood there|fore, mo&s;t unplea&s;antly by the door, and was exceeding|ly confu&s;ed at hearing a great many in a whi&s;pering way, remarking the &s;trangene&s;s of her not being noticed by &s;o near a relation as the Marchione&s;s of Ro&s;line. A general titter at her &s;ituation prevailed among Lady Eu|phra&s;ia's party, Lord Mortimer excepted. "Upon my word," &s;aid young Kilcorban, looking at Amanda, "&s;ome ladies &s;tudy attitudes, which would be as well let alone."&mdash;"For the &s;tudy of propriety," replied her La|dy&s;hip, who appeared to have unbended from her haugh|tine&s;s, "&s;he would do admirably for the figure of Hope:" "If &s;he had but an anchor to recline on," rejoined he: "Yes," an&s;wered her Lady&s;hip, "with her floating locks and die-away glances:" "or el&s;e Patience on a monument," cried he: "only &s;he has no grief here to &s;mile at," returned Lady Euphra&s;ia: "Pardon me there," &s;aid he, "&s;he has the grief, not indeed that I believe &s;he would &s;mile at it, of being totally eclip&s;ed by your lady&s;hip."</P>
<P>"Or what do you think," cried Lord Mortimer, who&s;e eyes &s;parkled with indignation during this dia|logue, "of likening her to Wi&s;dom, pitying the follies of human-kind, and &s;miling to &s;ee the &s;hafts of malice recoiling from the bo&s;om of innocence and mode&s;ty with contempt on tho&s;e who levelled them at it."</P>
<P>Amanda heard not the&s;e words, which were delivered in rather a low voice; her heart &s;welled with indigna|tion at the impertinence directed to her, and &s;he would have quitted the room, but that the pa&s;&s;age was too much crouded for her to pa&s;s. Sir Charles Bingley, occupied, in attending the young lady with whom he had danced&punc; ob&s;erved not Amanda till this moment: he in&s;tantly flew to her: "Alone, and &s;tanding?" &s;aid he, "Why did not I &s;ee you before?&mdash;you look fatigued." She was pale with emotion.&mdash;"Kilcorban," continued <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, "I mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e you did not &s;ee Mi&s;s Fitzalan, or your &s;eat would not have been kept:" then catching him by the arm, he rai&s;ed him nimbly from his chair, and
<PB N="26" REF="038416_0219_1011D282B76B0EB8">
directly carried it to Amanda; and having procured her refre&s;hments, &s;eated him&s;elf at her feet, exclaiming, "this is my throne, let kings come bow to it." Her lovely unaffected graces had excited Sir Charles's admi|ration; but it was the neglect with which he &s;aw her treated, diffu&s;ed &s;uch a &s;oothing tenderne&s;s through his manner as he now di&s;played; it hurt his &s;en&s;ibility and had &s;he even been plain in her appearance, would have rendered her the peculiar object of his attention; he dete&s;ted the Marchione&s;s and her daughter for their rancorous envy, as much as he de&s;pi&s;ed the Kilcorbans for their mean in&s;olence. The Marchione&s;s told him a long tale of the &s;hocking conduct of Amanda's parents, who&s;e ill qualities &s;he declared her looks announced her to po&s;&s;e&s;s, and endeavoured to depreciate her in his fa|vour, but that was impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>"Lord!" &s;aid Lady Euphra&s;ia, ri&s;ing as &s;he &s;poke, "let me pa&s;s, this &s;cene is &s;ickening." Lord Mortimer remained behind her: he loitered about the room, and his looks were often directed towards Amanda: her hopes began to revive: the lu&s;tre rekindled in her eyes, and a &s;oft blu&s;h again &s;tole over her cheek; though engaged to Sir Charles, &s;he felt &s;he &s;hould be plea&s;ed to have Lord Mortimer make an overture for her hand. The company were now returning to the ball-room, and Sir Charles took her hand to lead her after them. At this moment Lord Mortimer approached;&mdash;Amanda pau&s;ed, as if to adju&s;t &s;ome part of her dre&s;s; he pa&s;&s;ed on to a very beautiful girl, whom he immediately engaged and led from the room; &s;he followed them with her eyes, and continued without moving, till the fervent pre&s;&s;ure Sir Charles gave her hand re&s;tored her to recollection.</P>
<P>When the &s;et with him was fini&s;hed, &s;he would have left the hou&s;e directly, had her &s;ervant been there; but after putting up the hor&s;es, he had returned to Ca&s;tle Carberry and &s;he did not expect him till a very late hour. She declared her re&s;olution of dancing no more, and Sir Charles having avowed the &s;ame, they repaired to the card room, as the lea&s;t crouded room they could find. Lady Grey&s;tock was playing at the table, with
<PB N="27" REF="038416_0220_1011D285EFC172D8">
the Marquis and Marchione&s;s; &s;he beckoned Amanda to her, and having had no opportunity of &s;peaking be|fore, expre&s;&s;ed her plea&s;ure at then &s;eeing her. The Marquis examined her through his &s;pectacles&mdash;the Mar|chione&s;s frowned, and declared&punc; "She would take care, in future, to avoid parties, &s;ubject to &s;uch di&s;agreeable intruders." This &s;peech was too pointed not to be re|marked; Amanda wi&s;hed to appear undi&s;turbed, but her emotions grew too powerful to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and &s;he was obliged to move ha&s;tily from the table. Sir Charles followed her: "Cur&s;ed malignity," cried he, endeavouring to &s;creen her from ob&s;ervation, while tears trickled down her cheeks; "but my dear Mi&s;s Fitzalan, was your beauty and merit le&s;s con&s;picuous, you would have e&s;caped it; 'tis the vice of little minds to hate that excellence they cannot reach." "It is cruel, it is &s;hock|ing," &s;aid Amanda, "to &s;uffer enmity to outlive the ob|ject who excited it, and to hate the offspring on account of the parent; the original of this picture," and &s;he looked at her mother's, "merited not &s;uch conduct." Sir Charles gazed on it;&mdash;it was wet with the tears of Amanda; he wiped them off, and pre&s;&s;ing the hand|kerchief to his lips, put it in his bo&s;om.</P>
<P>At this in&s;tant Lord Mortimer appeared; he had, in|deed, been for &s;ome time an unnoticed ob&s;erver of the progre&s;s of this tete-a-tete. As &s;oon as he perceived he had attracted their regard, he quitted the room.</P>
<P>"His Lord&s;hip is like a troubled &s;pirit to night, wan|dering to and fro," &s;aid Sir Charles, "I really believe every thing is not right between him and lady Euphra|&s;ia." "Something then," cried Amanda, "is in agitati|on between him and her lady&s;hip," "So &s;ays the world," replied Sir Charles, "but I do not always give implicit credit to its reports; I have known Lord Mor|timer this long time, and from my knowledge of him, &s;hould never have &s;uppo&s;ed Lady Euphra&s;ia Sutherland a woman capable of plea&s;ing him: nay, to give my real opinion, I think him quite unintere&s;ted about her lady&s;hip; I will not &s;ay &s;o much as to all other females pre&s;ent; I really imagined &s;everal times to night from

Mortimer po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es more graces than tho&s;e which merely meet the eye, and is a rival I &s;hould by no means like to have."</P>
<P>Amanda, confu&s;ed by this di&s;cour&s;e, endeavoured to change it, and at la&s;t &s;ucceeded; they conver&s;ed plea|&s;antly together on different &s;ubjects, till they went to &s;upper, where Sir Charles &s;till continued his attention. Lord Mortimer was, or at lea&s;t appeared to be, entirely engro&s;&s;ed with Lady Euphra&s;ia, who from time to time tittered with the Mi&s;s Kilcorbans, and looked &s;atirically at Amanda. On quitting the &s;upper room, &s;he found her &s;ervant in the hall, and immediately de&s;ired him to have the carriage drawn up. Sir Charles, who held her hand, reque&s;ted her to &s;tay a little longer, yet acknow|legded it was &s;elf alone which dictated the reque&s;t, as he knew &s;he would not promote her own plea&s;ure by complying with it. As he handed her into the carriage, he told her he &s;hould &s;oon follow her example in reti|ring, as the &s;cene, &s;o lately delightful, in lo&s;ing her, would lo&s;e all its charms; he entreated and obtained permi&s;&s;ion, to wait on her the next morning.</P>
<P>How different was now the appearance of Amanda, to what it had been at her departure from Ca&s;tle Carber|ry; pale, trembling and languid, her father received her into his arms; for till &s;he returned, he could not think of going to re&s;t, and in&s;tantly gue&s;&s;ed the cau&s;e of her dejection. His heart mourned for the pangs in|flicted on his child's. When &s;he beheld him gazing on her with mingled woe and tenderne&s;s, &s;he tried to recruit her &s;pirits, and after relating a few particulars of the ball, an&s;wered the minute enquiries he made, relative to the conduct of the Marchione&s;s, and Lady Euphra&s;ia. He appeared unutterably affected on hearing it; "Mer|ciful power," exclaimed he, "what di&s;po&s;itions: but you are too lovely&mdash;too like your mother, my Amanda, in every perfection, to e&s;cape their malice:&mdash;oh! may it never injure you, as it did her; may that Providence, who&s;e protection I daily implore for the &s;weet child of
<PB N="29" REF="038416_0222_1011D28AEC7BE4C8">
my love, the &s;ource of earthly comfort, render every &s;cheme which may be formed again&s;t her, abortive; and oh! may it yet ble&s;s me with the &s;ight of her hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>Amanda retired to her chamber, inexpre&s;&s;ibly affect|ed by the language of her father: "Yes," cried &s;he, her heart &s;welling with pity and gratitude to him, "my &s;orrow in future &s;hall be concealed, to avoid exciting his:&mdash;the pain inflicted by thy incon&s;tancy, Mortimer, &s;hall be hid within the rece&s;&s;es of my heart, and never &s;hall the peace of my father be di&s;turbed, by knowing the lo&s;s of mine."</P>
<P>The grey dawn was now beginning to advance, but Amanda had no inclination for repo&s;e; as &s;he &s;tood at the window, &s;he heard the &s;olemn &s;tillne&s;s of the &s;cene frequently interrupted by the di&s;tant noi&s;e of carriages, carrying home the weary &s;ons and daughters of di&s;&s;ipa|tion. "But a few hours ago," &s;aid &s;he, "and how gay, how animated was my &s;oul: how dull, how cheerle&s;s now:&mdash;Oh! Mortimer, but a few hours ago, and I be|lieved my&s;elf the beloved of thine heart; but the flat|tering illu&s;ion is now over, and I no longer &s;hall hope, or thou deceive:" She changed her clothes, and flinging her&s;elf on the bed, from mere fatigue, at length &s;unk into a &s;lumber.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE next morning brought Sir Charles Bingley to Ca&s;tle Carberry; Fitzalan was out, but A|manda received him in her dre&s;&s;ing room. He told her, with evident concern, he was on the point of &s;etting off for the metropolis, to embark from thence immediately for England, having received letters that morning, which recalled him there; he regretted that their inti|macy, or rather friend&s;hip, as with in&s;inuating &s;oftne&s;s he entreated permi&s;&s;ion to call it, was interrupted at its very commencement; declared it gave him more pain than &s;he could imagine, or he expre&s;s; and that his re|turn to Ireland would be expedited, for the purpo&s;e of renewing it; and reque&s;ted he might be flattered with an a&s;&s;urance of not being totally forgotten during his ab&s;ence. Amanda an&s;wered him as if &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed mere politene&s;s had dictated the reque&s;t; "her father," &s;he &s;aid, "&s;he was &s;ure would be happy to &s;ee him, if he returned again to their neighbourhood." At his en|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">nce, he &s;aid he could &s;tay but a few minutes, yet he remained about two hours, and when he aro&s;e to depart, declared he had rea&s;on to think the ca&s;tle an enchanted one, he found it &s;o difficult to get from it; "yet, un|like the knights of old," continued he, "I wi&s;h not to break the &s;pell which detained me in it."</P>
<P>Day after day elap&s;ed, and no Lord Mortimer appear|ed. Amanda, indeed, heard frequently of him, and always as the admirer of Lady Euphra&s;ia; frequently, too, &s;he heard about the family at Ul&s;ter Lodge; their &s;uperb entertainments, and tho&s;e given in the
<PB N="31" REF="038416_0224_1011D291D5C47E98">
neighbourhood to them. The Kilcorbans &s;eemed to have given her up entirely; Lady Grey&s;tock was the only one of the family who continued to pay her any at|tention: &s;he called once or twice at Ca&s;tle Carberry, to &s;ee whether her apron was fini&s;hed, and tell all the news &s;he had picked up to Amanda. The re&s;olution which Amanda had formed, of concealing her melancholy from her father, &s;he &s;upported tolerably well, but &s;he only in|dulged it more freely in &s;olitude; the idea of Lord Mor|timer's union with Lady Euphra&s;ia, haunted her imagina|tion, and embittered every moment: "Yes," &s;he would exclaim, (as &s;he wandered through the garden, which had been converted from a rude wilderne&s;s, into a &s;cene of beauty, by her &s;uperintending care) "I have planted flowers, but another &s;hall enjoy their &s;weets; I have planted ro&s;es for Mortimer to &s;trew in the path of Lady Euphra&s;ia;&mdash;I have adorned the land&s;cape, and &s;he &s;hall enjoy its beauty.</P>
<P>About three weeks after the ball, as &s;he &s;at at work one morning in the dre&s;&s;ing room, beguiling her thoughts with a little plaintive &s;ong, &s;he heard the door &s;oftly open behind her: &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed it to be Ellen; but not finding any one advance, turned round, and perceived not Ellen indeed, but Lord Mortimer him&s;elf: &s;he &s;tarted from her chair&mdash;the work dropt from her hands, and &s;he had neither power of &s;peak or move.</P>
<P>"I fear I have &s;urpri&s;ed and alarmed you," &s;aid Lord Mortimer. "I a&s;k pardon for my intru&s;ion, but I was informed I &s;hould find Mr. Fitzalan here."</P>
<P>"He is in the &s;tudy, I believe, my Lord," replied A|manda coolly, and with re&s;tored compo&s;ure; "I will go and inform him your lord&s;hip wi&s;hes to &s;ee him."</P>
<P>"No," exclaimed he," I will not &s;uffer you to have &s;o much trouble: my bu&s;ine&s;s is not &s;o urgent as to re|quire my &s;eeing him immediately." He re-&s;eated Amanda, and drew a chair near her.</P>
<P>She pretended to be bu&s;ied with her work; whil&s;t the eyes of Lord Mortimer were ca&s;t round the room, as if viewing well known objects, which at once plea&s;ed and pained his &s;en&s;ibility, by awakening the memory of pa&s;t
<PB N="32" REF="038416_0225_1011D29595E6F6D0">
delightful days. "This room," &s;aid he, &s;oftly &s;igh|ing, "I well remember; it was the favourite retire|ment of one of the mo&s;t amiable of women."</P>
<P>"So I have heard," replied Amanda, "the virtues of Lady Cherbury are remembered with the true&s;t gra|titude by many in the vicinity of the ca&s;tle."</P>
<P>"I think," cried Lord Mortimer, gazing upon A|manda with the &s;ofte&s;t tenderne&s;s, "the apartment is &s;till occupied by a kindred &s;pirit."</P>
<P>Amanda's eyes were in&s;tantly bent on the ground, and a gentle &s;igh heaved her bo&s;om; but it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ather the &s;igh of regret than plea&s;ure; with &s;uch an accent as this, Lord Mortimer was wont to addre&s;s her at Tudor Hall, but &s;he had now rea&s;on to think it only a&s;&s;umed, for the purpo&s;e of di&s;covering whether &s;he yet retained any &s;en&s;ibility for him. Had he not treated her with the mo&s;t pointed neglect: was he not the declared ad|mirer of Lady Euphra&s;ia: had he not confe&s;t, on enter|ing the room, he came to &s;eek not her, but her father? The&s;e ideas <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> through her mind, determined her to continue no longer with him: delicacy, as well as pride, urged her to this; for &s;he feared, if &s;he longer li&s;tened to his in&s;inuating language, it might lead her to betray the feelings of her heart; &s;he therefore aro&s;e, and &s;aid &s;he would acquaint her father his lord&s;hip waited for him.</P>
<P>"Cold, in&s;en&s;ible Amanda," cried he, &s;natching her hand, to prevent her departing, "Is it thus you leave me? when we parted in Wales, I could not have believ|ed we &s;hould ever have had &s;uch a meeting as this."</P>
<P>"Perhaps not, my Lord," replied &s;he, &s;omewhat haughtily, "but we have both thought more prudent|ly &s;ince that period."</P>
<P>"Then why," &s;aid he, "did not prudence teach you to &s;hun a conduct which could create &s;u&s;picion?"</P>
<P>"Su&s;picion, my Lord!" repeated Amanda, with a kind of horror in her look.</P>
<P>"Pardon me," cried he, "the word is di&s;agreeable; but Mi&s;s Fitzalan, when you reflect on the manner in which you have acted to me; your precipitate, your
<PB N="33" REF="038416_0226_1011D29780C92430">
clande&s;tine departure, at the very period when a mutual acknowledgment of reciprocal feelings &s;hould have been attended with the mo&s;t explicit candour on both &s;ides, you cannot wonder at unplea&s;ant conjectures and tor|menting doubts obtruding on my mind."</P>
<P>"Is it po&s;&s;ible, my Lord," &s;aid Amanda, "you ne|ver conceived the rea&s;on of my departure? Is it po&s;&s;ible reflection never pointed it out?"</P>
<P>"Never, I &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ure you; nor &s;hall I be happy till I know it." He pau&s;ed, as if for a reply; but A|manda, agitated by his words, had not power to &s;peak. Whil&s;t &s;he &s;tood &s;ilent, trembling, and apparently em|barra&s;&s;ed, &s;he heard her father's voice, as he a&s;cended the &s;tairs. This in&s;tantly re&s;tored her's. "I mu&s;t go, my Lord," cried &s;he, &s;tarting, and &s;truggling to with|draw her hand. "Promi&s;e then to meet me," he &s;aid, "this evening at St. Catherine's, by &s;even, or I will not let you go; my &s;oul will be in tortures till I have your actions explained." "I do promi&s;e," &s;aid Amanda. Lord Mortimer relea&s;ed her, and &s;he retired into her chamber ju&s;t time enough to avoid her father.</P>
<P>Again her hopes began to revive: again &s;he believed &s;he was not mi&s;taken in &s;uppo&s;ing Lord Mortimer had come into Ireland on her account. His being mention|ed as the admirer of Lady Euphra&s;ia, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed ow|ing to his being a re&s;ident in the hou&s;e with her. About her&s;elf had he been indifferent, he never could have be|trayed &s;uch emotions: his looks, as well as language, expre&s;&s;ed the feelings of a heart tenderly attached and truly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. Lea&s;t any circum&s;tance had happened, which would prevent a renewal of that attachment, &s;he felt as much impatience as he manife&s;ted, to give the de&s;ired explanation of her conduct.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip was &s;carcely gone, ere Lady Grey&s;tock made her appearance. Amanda &s;uppo&s;ed, as u&s;ual, &s;he only came to pay a flying vi&s;it: how great then was her mortification and &s;urpri&s;e, when her Lady&s;hip told her &s;he was come to &s;pend the day quite in the family way with her, as the ladies of Grangeville were &s;o bu&s;y pre|paring
<PB N="34" REF="038416_0227_1011D29C203F91C8">
for a &s;plendid entertainment they were to be at the en&s;uing day, that they had excluded all vi&s;itors, and rendered the hou&s;e quite di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P>Amanda endeavoured to appear plea&s;ed, but to con|ver&s;e &s;he found almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible, her thoughts were &s;o engro&s;&s;ed by an ab&s;ent object; happily her lady&s;hip was &s;o very loquacious her&s;elf, as at all times to require a li&s;tener more than a &s;peaker; &s;he was therefore well &s;a|tisfied with the taciturnity of her fair companion. Aman|da tried to derive &s;ome comfort from the hope that her lady&s;hip would depart early in the evening, to which &s;he flattered her&s;elf &s;he would be induced by the idea of a comfortable whi&s;t party at home. But &s;ix o'clock &s;truck, and &s;he manife&s;ted no inclination to move. Amanda was in agony; her cheek was flu&s;hed with agitation; &s;he ro&s;e and walked to the window, to conceal her emotion, whil&s;t her father and Lady Grey&s;tock were conver&s;ing; the former at la&s;t &s;aid he had &s;ome letters to write, and begged her lady&s;hip to excu&s;e his ab&s;ence for a few mi|nutes. This &s;he mo&s;t graciou&s;ly promi&s;ed to do, and pulling out her knotting, reque&s;ted Amanda to read to her till tea time. Amanda took up a book, but was &s;o confu&s;ed, &s;he &s;carcely knew what, or how &s;he read.</P>
<P>"Softly, &s;oftly, my dear child," at la&s;t exclaimed her lady&s;hip, who&s;e attention could by no means keep pace with the rapid manner in which &s;he read. "I prote&s;t you po&s;t on with as much expedition as my lady Blerner's ponies on the circular." Amanda blu&s;hed, and began to read &s;lowly; but when the clock &s;truck &s;even, her feel|ings could no longer be repre&s;&s;ed. "Good heaven," cried &s;he, letting the book drop from her hand, and &s;tarting from her chair, "this is too much."&mdash;"Ble&s;s me, my dear," &s;aid lady Grey&s;tock, &s;taring at her, "What is the matter?" "Only a &s;light head-ache, ma|dam," an&s;wered Amanda, continuing to walk about the room.</P>
<P>Her bu&s;y fancy repre&s;ented Lord Mortimer now im|patiently waiting for her&mdash;thinking in every &s;ound which echoed among the de&s;olate ruins of St. Catherine's, he heard her foot&s;teps, his &s;oul melting with tenderne&s;s at
<PB N="35" REF="038416_0228_1011D29DB317C1F8">
the idea of a perfect reconciliation, which an un&s;atisfied doubt only retarded. What would he infer from her not keeping an appointment &s;o ardently de&s;ired, &s;o &s;olemnly promi&s;ed, but that &s;he was unable to remove that doubt to his &s;atisfaction: perhaps he would not credit the rea|&s;on &s;he could a&s;&s;ign for breaking her engagement: per|haps, piqued at her doing &s;o, he would not afford her an opportunity of accounting for it, or the apparent my&s;te|ry of her late conduct; to retain his doubts would be to lo&s;e his tenderne&s;s, and at la&s;t perhaps expel her from his heart. She thought of &s;ending Ellen to acquaint him with the occa&s;ion of her detention at home; but this idea exi&s;ted but for a moment; an appointment &s;he concealed from her father, &s;he could not bear to divulge to any other per&s;on; it would be a breach of duty and delicacy &s;he thought: "No," &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf, "I will not, from the thoughtle&s;sne&s;s and impetuo&s;ity which lead &s;o many of my &s;ex a&s;tray, over&s;tep the bounds of propriety, and to rein&s;tate my&s;elf in the e&s;teem of one per&s;on, lo&s;e that of others, and above all that of my own heart. If Lord Mortimer refu&s;es to hear my ju&s;tification, he will act neither agreeable to candour or ju&s;tice, and pride mu&s;t aid in repelling my regret."</P>
<P>"You look &s;trangely indeed, my dear," &s;aid Lad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Grey&s;tock, who was attentively watching her whil&s;t tho&s;e ideas were ri&s;ing in her mind. Amanda recollect|ed the remarks which might be made on her behaviour, and apologizing for the manner in which &s;he had acted, took her &s;eat with &s;ome degree of compo&s;ure. Fitzalan &s;oon after entered the room, and tea was made; when over, Lady Grey&s;tock declared they were a &s;nug party for three handed whi&s;t. Amanda would gladly have excu&s;ed her&s;elf from being of the party, but politene&s;s made her conceal her reluctance; her extreme dejection was noticed both by Fitzalan and her Lady&s;hip; the lat|ter imputed it to regret at not being permitted by her father to accept an invitation &s;he had received for a ball the en&s;uing evening.</P>
<P>"Don't fret about it, my dear creature," &s;aid &s;he, laying down her cards, to admini&s;ter the con&s;olation &s;he
<PB N="36" REF="038416_0229_1011D2A098898650">
required; "'tis not by frequenting balls and public pla|ces a girl always &s;tands the be&s;t chance of being provi|ded for; I, for my part, have been married three times, yet never made a conque&s;t of any one of my hu&s;bands in a public place: no, it was the privacy of my life partly obtained for me &s;o many proofs of good fortune." Fitzalan and Amanda laughed. "I &s;hall never be di&s;|&s;atisfied with &s;taying at home," &s;aid the latter, "though without either expecting or de&s;iring to have my retire|ment recompen&s;ed as your Lady&s;hip's was."</P>
<P>"One prize will &s;atisfy you then," &s;aid Fitzalan, "Ah!" cried Lady Grey&s;tock, "it is Lady Euphra&s;ia Sutherland who will obtain the capital one&punc; I don't know where &s;uch another young man as Lord Morti|mer is to be found."&mdash;"Then your Lady&s;hip &s;uppo|&s;es," &s;aid Fitzalan, "there is &s;ome truth in the reports circulated, relative to him and Lady Euphra&s;ia."&mdash;"I a&s;&s;ure you there is," &s;aid &s;he, "and I think the con|nexion will be a very eligible one; their births, their fortunes are equal." But ah! thought Amanda, how un|like their di&s;po&s;itions. "I dare &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y," proceeded her lady&s;hip, "Lady Euphra&s;ia will have changed her ti|tle before this time next year."</P>
<P>Fitzalan glanced at Amanda; her face was deadly pale, and &s;he put him and Lady Grey&s;tock out in the game by the errors &s;he committed. At la&s;t the carriage from Grangeville arrived, and broke up a party Amanda could not much longer have &s;upported. Her father per|ceived the painful efforts &s;he made to conceal her di&s;|tre&s;s: he pitied her from his &s;oul, and pretending to think &s;he was only indi&s;po&s;ed, entreated her to retire to her chamber. Amanda gladly complied with this entreaty, and began to meditate on what Grey&s;tock had &s;aid: Was there not a probability of its being true&punc; Might not the indifference Lord Mortimer had manife&s;ted on his fir&s;t arrival in the neighbourhood, have really originated from a change of affections? Might not the tenderne&s;s he di&s;played in the morning, have been concerted with the hope of its inducing her to gratify his curio&s;ity, by re|lating the rea&s;on of her journey from Wales, or plea&s;e
<PB N="37" REF="038416_0230_1011D2A4131EE1D8">
his vanity by tempting her to give &s;ome proof of attach|ment? But &s;he &s;oon receded from this idea. Lady Grey|&s;tock was not infallible in her judgment: reports of ap|proaching nuptials Amanda knew had often been rai&s;ed without any foundation for them: the pre&s;ent report, relative to Lord Mortimer and Lady Euphra&s;ia, might be one of that nature; &s;he could not believe him &s;o egre|giou&s;ly vain, or &s;o deliberately ba&s;e, as to counterfeit tenderne&s;s, merely for the purpo&s;e of having his curio|&s;ity or vanity gratified: &s;he felt, however, truly unhap|py, and could derive no con&s;olation but from the hope that her &s;u&s;pence, at lea&s;t, would &s;oon be terminated.</P>
<P>She pa&s;&s;ed a re&s;tle&s;s night, nor was her morning more compo&s;ed; &s;he could not &s;ettle to any of her u&s;ual avo|cations; every &s;tep &s;he heard, &s;he &s;tarted, in expectation of in&s;tantly &s;eeing Lord Mortimer, but he did not ap|pear. After dinner &s;he walked out alone, and took the road to St. Catherine's. When &s;he reached the ruins &s;he felt fatigued, and &s;at down upon a flag in the chapel to re&s;t her&s;elf. "Here," &s;aid &s;he, pen&s;ively leaning her head upon her hand, "Mortimer waited for me; perhaps with tender impatience:&mdash;here too, he perhaps accu&s;ed me of neglect or deceit." She heard a ru&s;tling behind her, and turning perceived &s;i&s;ter Mary.</P>
<P>"You are welcome, my dear &s;oul," cried the good natured nun, running forward, and &s;itting down by her, "but why did you not come in to &s;ee us," continued &s;he, affectionately ki&s;&s;ing her. Amanda &s;aid "&s;uch was her intention, but feeling a little indi&s;po&s;ed, &s;he had remained in the air, in hopes of growing better."</P>
<P>"Oh Je&s;u," cried the &s;i&s;ter, "you do indeed look ill, I mu&s;t go and get you a cordial from our Priore&s;s, who is quite a doctre&s;s I a&s;&s;ure you."</P>
<P>Amanda caught her gown as &s;he was running away, and a&s;&s;ured her &s;he was better.</P>
<P>"Well then," &s;aid &s;he, re&s;uming her &s;eat' "I mu&s;t tell you an odd thing which happened here la&s;t night; I came out to walk about the ruins between the lights, that is, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> one may &s;ay, when it is neither dark, or light.
<PB N="38" REF="038416_0231_1011D2A87527B250">
As the air was cold, I wrapt my veil about me, and had ju&s;t turned the cloi&s;ters, when I heard a quick foot pa|cing after me: well, I &s;uppo&s;ing it to be one of the &s;i&s;|ters, walked &s;lowly, that &s;he might ea&s;ily overtake me; but you may gue&s;s my &s;urpri&s;e, when I was overtaken, not by one of them indeed, but by one of the fine&s;t and mo&s;t beautiful young men I ever beheld. Lord how he did &s;tart when he &s;aw me, ju&s;t for all the world as if I were a gho&s;t: he looked quite wild, and flew off mut|tering &s;omething to him&s;elf. Well, I thought all this &s;trange, and was making all the ha&s;te I could to the convent, when he appeared again, coming from under that broken arch, and he bowed and &s;miled &s;o &s;weetly and held his hat in his hand &s;o re&s;pectfully, whil&s;t he begged my pardon for the alarm he had given me; and then he blu&s;hed and &s;trove to hide his confu&s;ion with his handkerchief, while he a&s;ked me if I had &s;een e're a young lady about the ruins that evening, as a particu|lar friend had informed him &s;he would be there, and de&s;ired him to e&s;cort her home."</P>
<P>"Why, my dear Sir," &s;ays I, "I have been about this place the whole evening, and here has neither been man, woman or child, but you and my&s;elf; &s;o the young lady changed her mind and took another ramble." "So I &s;uppo&s;e," &s;aid he; and he looked &s;o pale, and &s;o melancholy, I could not help thinking it was a &s;weet|heart he had been &s;eeking; &s;o by way of giving him a bit of comfort, "Sir," &s;ays I, "if you will leave any marks of the young lady you were &s;eeking, with me, I will watch here my&s;elf a little longer for her, and if &s;he comes&punc; I will tell her how unea&s;y you were at not finding her, and be &s;ure to di&s;patch her after you." "No, he thanked me," he &s;aid, "but it was of very little con&s;equence his not meeting her, or indeed whe|ther he ever met her again," and walked away.</P>
<P>"Did he!" &s;aid Amanda.</P>
<P>"Ble&s;s me!" exclaimed the nun, "you are wor&s;e in&s;tead of better."</P>
<P>Amanda acknowledged &s;he was, and ri&s;ing, reque&s;t|ed &s;he would excu&s;e her not paying her compliments that evening at the nunnery.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="038416_0232_1011D2AA0A2657C8">
Si&s;ter Mary pre&s;t her to drink tea with the Priore&s;s, or at lea&s;t take &s;ome of her excellent cordial; but Aman|da refu&s;ed both reque&s;ts, and the affectionate nun &s;aw her depart with reluctance.</P>
<P>Scarcely had &s;he regained the road, 'ere a coach and &s;ix, preceded and followed by a number of attendants, approached with &s;uch quickne&s;s, that &s;he was obliged to &s;tep a&s;ide to avoid it: looking in at the window as it pa&s;&s;ed, &s;he &s;aw Lord Mortimer and Lady Euphra&s;ia &s;eated in it, oppo&s;ite to each other; &s;he &s;aw they both perceived her, and that lady Euphra&s;ia laughed, and put her head forward to &s;tare impertinently at her. A|manda was mortified that they had &s;een her; there was &s;omething at that moment humiliating in the contra&s;t between their &s;ituation and her's; &s;he dejected and &s;o|litary, they, adorned and attended with all the advanta|ges of fortune. But in the e&s;timation of a liberal mind, cried &s;he, the want of &s;uch advantages can never le&s;|&s;en me&mdash;&s;uch a mind as I flatter my&s;elf Lord Mortimer po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es. Ah, if he thinks as I do, he would prefer a lonely ramble in the de&s;olate &s;pot I have ju&s;t quitted, to all the parade and magnificence he is about witne&s;&s;ing. The night pa&s;t heavily away; the idea of Lord Mor|timer's devoting all his attention to Lady Euphra&s;ia, could not be driven from her mind.</P>
<P>The next morning, the fir&s;t object &s;he &s;aw, on going to the window, was a large frigate laying at anchor near the ca&s;tle. Ellen entered her chamber, &s;ighing heavily, as &s;he always did, indeed, at the &s;ight of a &s;hip, &s;aid, &s;he wi&s;hed it contained her wandering &s;ailor. Amanda indulged a hope that Lord Mortimer would appear in the cour&s;e of the day, but &s;he was di&s;appointed. She re|tired after tea in the evening to her dre&s;&s;ing room, and &s;eated in the window, enjoyed a calm and beautiful &s;cene; not a cloud concealed the bright azure of the firmament; the moon &s;pread a line of &s;ilvery radiance over the waves, that &s;tole with a melancholy murmur upon the &s;hore; and the &s;ilence which reigned around, was only interrupted by the faint noi&s;e of the mariners
<PB N="40" REF="038416_0233_1011D2AD95A221B8">
on board the frigate, and their evening drum. At la&s;t Amanda heard the paddling of oars, and perceived a large boat coming from the &s;hip, rowed by &s;ailors in white &s;hirts and trow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ers, their voices keeping time to their oars. The appearance they made was picture&s;que, and Amanda watched them till the boat di&s;appeared among the rocks. The &s;upper bell &s;oon after &s;ummoned her from the window; but &s;carcely had &s;he retired to her chamber for the night, 'ere Ellen, &s;miling, trem|bling, and apparently overcome with joy, appeared.</P>
<P>"I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;een him," cried &s;he ha&s;tily, "oh, madam, I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> poor Chip him&s;elf, and he is as kind and as true hearted as ever. I went this evening to the village to &s;ee old Norah, to whom you &s;ent the linen, for &s;he is a plea&s;ing kind of poty, and does not laugh like the re&s;t at one, for their Welch tongue, &s;o when I was returning home, and at a goot ti&s;tance from her cabin, I &s;aw a great number of men coming towards me, all dre&s;t in white; to be &s;ure, as I heard a great teal about the white poys, I thought the&s;e were nothing el&s;e, and I did &s;o quake and tremble, for there was neither hole, or bu&s;h, or tree on the &s;pot, that would have &s;heltered one of the little tiny farry's of Penmaenmawr. Well, they came on, &s;houting and laughing, and merrier than I thought &s;uch rogues ought to be; and the moment they e&s;pied me, they gathered round me, and began pulling me apout, &s;o I gave a great &s;cream, and tirectly a voice, (lort how my heart jumped at it) cried out that is El|len; and to be &s;ure poor Chip &s;oon had me in his arms, and then I heard they were &s;ailors from the frigate, come to get fre&s;h provi&s;ions at the village; &s;o I turned pack with them, and they had a great powl of whi&s;key pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ch, and a whole &s;ight of cakes, and Chip told me all his at|venters; and he was &s;o glad when he heard I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with you, becau&s;e he &s;aid you were a &s;weet, mild young la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y, and he was &s;ure you would &s;ometimes remind me of him; and he hopes &s;oon to get his ti&s;charge, and then&mdash;"</P>

"Yes, matam, and I a&s;&s;ure you Chip is not altered for the wor&s;e py a &s;ea-fairing life; his voice, inteed, is a little of the roughe&s;t, but he told me that was owing to his learning the poatswain's whi&s;tle; poor fellow, he &s;ails to-morrow night; the &s;hip is on the Iri&s;h &s;tation, and they are to coa&s;t it to Dublin."</P>
<P>"Happy Ellen," &s;aid Amanda, as &s;he retired from her chamber, "thy perturbations and di&s;quietudes are over, a&s;&s;ured of the affection of thy village &s;wain, peace and cheerfulne&s;s will re&s;ume their empire in thy brea&s;t."</P>
<P>The next evening, at twi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight, Amanda went down to the beach with her father, to &s;ee the fi&s;hermen draw|ing their &s;cines on &s;hore, on which their hopes, and the comfort of their families depended. Whil&s;t Fitzalan conver&s;ed with them, Amanda &s;eated her&s;elf on a low rock, to ob&s;erve their motions; in the murmur of the waves there was a gentle melancholy, in uni&s;on with her pre&s;ent feelings; from a pen&s;ive meditation, which had gradually rendered her inattentive to the &s;cene be|fore her, &s;he was &s;uddenly rou&s;ed by voices behind her. She &s;tarted from her &s;eat, for in one of them &s;he imagin|ed &s;he di&s;tingui&s;hed the accent of Lord Mortimer; nor was &s;he mi&s;taken, he was de&s;cending a winding path near her, accompanied by a naval officer. To pa&s;s with|out &s;eeing her was impo&s;&s;ible; and as he approached her he &s;topt, apparently he&s;itating whether or not he &s;hould addre&s;s her. In a few minutes his he&s;itation ended, with waving his handkerchief, as if to bid her adieu, whil&s;t he proceeded to a &s;mall boat, which had been for &s;ome time la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing in a creek among the rocks, and which, on receiving him and his companion, immediately rowed to the frigate. Amanda trembled, her heart beat vio|lently. Ellen had informed her the frigate was to &s;ail that night; and what could induce Lord Mortimer to vi&s;it it at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uch an hour, except an intention of departing in it.</P>
<P>Uncertainty is dreadful; &s;he grew &s;ick with anxiety before her father returned to the ca&s;tle; on entering it, &s;he immediately repaired to her chamber, and calling

Ellen ha&s;tily, demanded if Chip's intelligence was true?</P>
<P>"Alas! yes," replied Ellen, weeping violently, "and I know the rea&s;on you enquire.

<P>"Oh, you will never forgive me for acting &s;o padly as I have done by you, &s;obbed Ellen, "put inteed the &s;ight of poor Chip drove every thing from my memory put him|&s;elf.

"I told him you was, and Cot knows my lort," &s;ays I, "and melancholy enough too. I left her in the tre&s;&s;ing room window, looking out at the waves, and li&s;tening to the winds."

<P>Ellen's efforts at con&s;olation were not &s;ucce&s;sful, and Amanda di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her, that unnoticed and unre&s;trained &s;he might indulge the tears which flowed at the idea of a long, a la&s;ting &s;eparation, perhaps, from Lord Mor|timer; offended, ju&s;tly offended, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, with her; the probability was, &s;he would be bani&s;hed from his thoughts, or if remembered, at lea&s;t without e&s;teem or tenderne&s;s; thus might his heart &s;oon be qualified for making another choice. She walked to the win|dow, and &s;aw the &s;hip already under weigh; &s;he &s;aw the white &s;ails fluttering in the breeze, and heard the &s;houts of the mariners. "Oh Mortimer!" cried &s;he, "is it thus we part? is it thus the expectations you rai&s;ed in my heart, are di&s;appointed? you go hence, and deem A|manda unworthy a farewell; you gaze perhaps, at this moment on Ca&s;tle Carberry without breathing one &s;igh for its inhabitants: ah, had you loved &s;incerely never would the impul&s;e of re&s;entment have conquered the emo|tion of tenderne&s;s:&mdash;no, Mortimer, you deceived me, and perhaps your&s;elf, in &s;aying I was dear to you:&mdash;had I been &s;o, never could you have acted in this manner.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>LORD Mortimer had, in reality, departed with &s;entiments very unfavourable to Amanda: he had waited impatiently at St. Catherine's, in fond expectation of having all his doubts removed, by a candid explanation of the motives which cau&s;ed her precipitate journey from Wales; his &s;oul &s;ighed for reconciliation; his tender|ne&s;s was redoubled by being &s;o long re&s;trained; the idea of folding his beloved Amanda to his bo&s;om, and hear|ing that &s;he de&s;erved all the tenderne&s;s and &s;en&s;ibility which glowed in that bo&s;om for her, gave him the high|e&s;t plea&s;ure; but when the appointed hour pa&s;&s;ed and no Amanda appeared, language cannot expre&s;s his di&s;|appointment: almo&s;t di&s;tracted by it, he ventured to enquire concerning her, from &s;i&s;ter Mary; and long af|ter the friendly nun had retired, to the convent con|tinued to wander about the ruins, till the &s;hadows of night had enveloped every object from his view.</P>
<P>"She fears to come then," exclaimed he quitting the de&s;olate &s;pot, oppre&s;&s;ed with the keene&s;t angu&s;h, "&s;he fears to come, becau&s;e &s;he cannot &s;atisfy my doubts; I witne&s;&s;ed her agitation, her embarra&s;&s;ment this morn|ing, when I hinted at them; the my&s;tery which &s;epara|ted us will not be explained, and it is vain to think we &s;hall ever meet, as I once flattered my&s;elf we &s;hould."</P>
<P>This thought &s;eemed to &s;trike at all his hopes; the di&s;tre&s;s and di&s;order of his mind was depictured on his
<PB N="45" REF="038416_0238_1011E2FCAFEF0EA0">
countenance, and e&s;caped not the ob&s;ervation and raille|ry of the Marchione&s;s and Lady Euphra&s;ia; but their raillery was vain, and unan&s;wered by him; he was ab|&s;orbed in a train of pen&s;ive reflections, which they had neither power to remove or di&s;turb.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t unwillingly he accompanied them the en&s;uing day to a &s;plendid entertainment given purpo&s;ely for them in the neighbourhood. The unexpected &s;ight of Aman|da, as &s;he &s;tood on a little elevated bank, to avoid the carriage, cau&s;ed a &s;udden emotion of &s;urpri&s;e and delight in his bo&s;om; the utmo&s;t powers of eloquence could not have pleaded her cau&s;e &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully as her own appearance at that minute did: the langour of her face; its mild and &s;eraphic expre&s;&s;ion; her pen&s;ive atti|tude, and the timid mode&s;ty with which &s;he &s;eemed &s;hrinking from ob&s;ervation, all touched the &s;en&s;ibility of Lord Mortimer, awakened his &s;ofte&s;t feelings, revi|ved his hopes, and made him re&s;olve to &s;eek another op|portunity of demanding an explanation from her. The &s;udden colour which flu&s;hed in his cheeks, and the &s;parkling of his eyes, as he looked from the carriage, at|tracted the notice of his companions: they &s;miled ma|liciou&s;ly at each other, and Lady Euphra&s;ia declared, "&s;he &s;uppo&s;ed the girl was &s;tationed there to try and attract admiration, which, perhaps, her &s;illy old father had told her &s;he merited: or el&s;e to meet with adven|tures." Lord Mortimer drew in his head, and the con|tra&s;t between her Lady&s;hip and the fair being he had been looking at, never &s;truck him &s;o forcibly as at that moment and le&s;&s;ened one as much as it elevated the other, in his e&s;timation.</P>
<P>He wandered near the ca&s;tle the next evening, in hopes of meeting Amanda; his di&s;appointment was dimini&s;h|ed by &s;eeing Ellen, who he was confident would be faithful to the me&s;&s;age entru&s;ted to her&punc; with this con|fidence he ha&s;tened to the rocks, every moment expecting the appearance of Amanda. Her image, as it appeared to him the preceding day, dwelt upon his imagination, and he forcibly felt how e&s;&s;ential to his peace was a re|conciliation
<PB N="46" REF="038416_0239_1011E2FE40EB1F68">
with her. An hour elap&s;ed, and his tender|ne&s;s again began to give way to re&s;entment: it was not Ellen, but Amanda he doubted. He traver&s;ed the beach in an agony of impatience and anxiety; a feveri&s;h heat pervaded his frame, and he trembled with agitation. At length he heard the di&s;tant &s;ound of the &s;upper bell at Ul&s;ter Lodge, which never rang till a late hour. All hopes of &s;eeing Amanda were now given up, and every intention of meeting her at a future period, relinqui&s;hed. She avoided him de&s;ignedly it was evident; he would have cur&s;t him&s;elf for betraying &s;uch anxiety about her, and his wounded pride revolted from the idea of &s;eeking another interview." "No Amanda," he exclaim|ed as he pa&s;&s;ed the ca&s;tle, "you can no longer have any claim upon me; my&s;terious appearances in the mo&s;t candid mind will rai&s;e &s;u&s;picions; in giving you an op|portunity for accounting for &s;uch appearances, I did all that candour, tenderne&s;s, &s;en&s;ibility, and honour could dictate: and in&s;tead of again making efforts to conver&s;e with you, I mu&s;t now make others, which I tru&s;t will be more &s;ucce&s;sful, entirely to forget you."</P>
<P>The next morning he accompanied the Marquis in his barge to the frigate, where he was agreeably &s;urpri|&s;ed to find in the commander an old friend of his, Cap|tain Somerville, returned to Ul&s;ter Lodge with his vi&s;itors, and there, in a half je&s;ting, half &s;erious manner, a&s;ked Lord Mortimer to accompany him in his intended cruize. This his Lord&s;hip in&s;tantly promi&s;ed he would, with plea&s;ure: he was completely tired of the Ro&s;line family, and was be&s;ides glad of an opportunity of convincing A|manda he was not quite &s;o fa&s;cinated to her (as &s;he perhaps believed) by his quitting the the neighbourhood ere their departure. As he de&s;cended to the boat, the &s;ight of A|manda, &s;hook his re&s;olution; &s;he &s;eemed de&s;tined to cro&s;s his re&s;olution; &s;he &s;eemed de&s;tined to cro&s;s his path, merely to give him di&s;quietude; an ar|dent wi&s;h &s;prung in his heart to addre&s;s her, but it was in&s;tantly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, by reflecting how premeditatedly &s;he had avoided him; pride therefore prompted him to pa&s;s her in &s;ilence yet as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t receded from the &s;hore, his eyes were rivited to the &s;pot on which &s;he
<PB N="47" REF="038416_0240_1011E301219DA2F8">
&s;tood, and when he could no longer &s;ee he white gown fluttering in the wind, he gave a &s;igh to the remem|brance of the happy days he had pa&s;&s;ed with her at Tuder-Hall: another to the idea, that &s;uch hours would never more be enjoyed by him.</P>
<P>The family at Ul&s;ter Lodge were both mortified and di&s;appointed by his departure; though he perceiving their di&s;plea&s;ure, had endeavoured to le&s;&s;en it, by pro|mi&s;ing to wait their arrival in Dublin, and return with them to England. His departure &s;eemed a tacit intima|tion that he was not as much attached to Lady Euphra|&s;ia as they wi&s;hed him to be; a &s;u&s;picion of this nature had, indeed for &s;ome time pervaded their minds, and al&s;o that his affections were el&s;ewhere di&s;po&s;ed of: they had rea&s;on to believe that the per&s;on who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them dwelt in the vicinity of the Lodge, from the great alteration which took place in his manner, immediately after his arrival at it. In hopes of di&s;covering who this was, they watched him critically at all the parties he fre|quented with them, but &s;oon found it was not the pre|&s;ent, but the ab&s;ent objects had the power of exciting emotions in him. At the name of Amanda Fitzalan, or her father, they ob&s;erved him colour, and frequently &s;aw him contemplate Ca&s;tle Carberry, as if it contained a being infinitely dear to him; to Amanda, therefore, they feared he was attached, and &s;uppo&s;ed the attach|ment commenced at Kilcorban's ball, where they had noticed his impa&s;&s;ioned glances at this hated, though becau&s;e too lovely, relation. The mo&s;t unbounded rage took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their &s;ouls; they regretted having ever come to Ireland, where they &s;uppo&s;ed Lord Morti|mer had fir&s;t &s;een Amanda, as Lord Cherbury had men|tioned the children of Fitzalan being &s;trangers to him, or his family. They knew the pa&s;&s;ions of Lord Cher|bury were impetuous, and that ambition was the leading principle of his &s;oul; anxious for an alliance between his family and theirs, they knew he would ill brook any ob&s;tacle which &s;hould be thrown in the way of its com|pletion, and therefore re&s;olved, if Lord Mortimer, at their next meeting, appeared aver&s;e to the wi&s;hes of his
<PB N="48" REF="038416_0241_1011E303B44AE2F8">
father, to acquaint the Earl with the occa&s;ion of his &s;on's di&s;inclination, and repre&s;ent Fitzalan and his daughter as aiding and abetting each other, in an in&s;idious &s;cheme to entangle the affections of Lord Mortimer, and draw him into a marriage, a &s;cheme which, to a man of the world, (as they knew Lord Cherbury to be) would appear &s;o very probable as to gain implicit credit. This they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> would convert the e&s;teem he felt for Fitzalan into hatred and contempt&punc; his favour would con&s;equently be withdrawn, and the father and child again &s;unk into indigent ob&s;curity. To think that A|manda, by dire nece&s;&s;ity, &s;hould be reduced to &s;ervi|tude: to think the elegance of her form &s;hould be di&s;|gui&s;ed by the garb of poverty, and the charms of her face faded by mi&s;ery, were ideas &s;o grateful, &s;o ec&s;tatic to their hearts, that to have them realized, they fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t they could with plea&s;ure relinqui&s;h the attentions of Lord Mortimer to have a pretext for injuring Fitzalan with his father; though not quite a&s;&s;ured their &s;u&s;picions were well &s;ounded, they would never have he&s;itated communicating them as &s;uch to Lord Cherbury; but for their own &s;atisfaction they wi&s;hed to know what rea&s;on they had to entertain them. Lady Grey&s;to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">k was the only per&s;on they ob&s;erved on a footing of intimacy with Amanda, and through her means flattered them&s;elves they might make the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ired di&s;covery. They, therefore, began to unbend from their haughtine&s;s, and make over|tures for an intimacy with her&mdash;overtures which &s;he re|ceived with delight, and in their pre&s;ent attention forgot their pa&s;t neglect, which had given her &s;uch di&s;gu&s;t. As they became intimate with her, they were much a|mu&s;ed by a &s;hrewd manner &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of telling &s;to|ries, and placing the foibles and imperfections of their vi&s;itors in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t con&s;picuous and ludicrous light, par|ticularly &s;uch vi&s;itors as were not agreeable to them. With the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of human nature &s;he was well acquaint|ed, al&s;o with the art of turning tho&s;e foibles to her own advantage.

After an injunction of &s;ecrecy, the Marchione&s;s com|municated her fears relative to Lord Mortimer and A|manda, which &s;he pretended regard for one, and pity for the other, had excited; as an attachment either of an honourable or di&s;honourable nature, &s;he knew Lord Cherbury would never pardon. To know, therefore, how far matters had proceeded between them, would be &s;ome &s;atisfaction, and might, perhaps, be the means of preventing the ill con&s;equences &s;he dreaded. Lady Grey&s;tock was not to be impo&s;ed on; &s;he perceived it was not pity for Amanda, but envy and jealou&s;y which had excited the fears of the Marchione&s;s. If Lord Mortimer was attached to Amanda, from his &s;entiments and manner, &s;he was convinced it was an attachment of the pure&s;t nature. She carefully concealed her thoughts however, affected to enter into all the alarms of the Marchione&s;s, and as &s;he &s;aw &s;he was expected to do, promi&s;ed all in her power &s;hould be done for di&s;covering what attachment &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between his Lord&s;hip and Mi&s;s Fitzalan. For this purpo&s;e &s;he began to grow con|&s;tant in her vi&s;its at Ca&s;tle Carberry, often &s;pending whole days in the mo&s;t familiar manner with Amanda, and endeavouring, by various methods, to beguile her of the &s;ecrets of her heart. Sometimes &s;he ralied her on her melancholy; &s;ometimes expre&s;&s;ed pity for it, in &s;trains of the mo&s;t &s;oothing tenderne&s;s: would frequent|ly relate little fictitious and embelli&s;hed anecdotes of her own youth, in which &s;he &s;aid &s;he had &s;uffered the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite mi&s;ery, from an unfortunate entangle|ment: would then advert to Lord Mortimer; expre&s;s her wonder at his precipitate departure, and her admira|tion of his virtues, declaring, if ever Lady Euphra&s;ia gained his heart, which &s;he much doubted, &s;he mu&s;t be con&s;idered as one of the mo&s;t fortunate of women.</P>
<P>Delicacy &s;ealed the lips of Amanda, and guarded her &s;ecret. She believed her pa&s;&s;ion to be hopele&s;s, and felt that to be offered con&s;olation on &s;uch a &s;ubject, would to her feelings, be truly humiliating. But though &s;he
<PB N="50" REF="038416_0243_1011E30851580C58">
could command her words, &s;he could not her feelings, and they were vi&s;ibly expre&s;&s;ed in her countenance: &s;he blu&s;hed whenever Lord Mortimer was mentioned: look|ed &s;hocked if an union between him and Lady Euphra|&s;ia was hinted at; and &s;miled if a probability was &s;ug|ge&s;ted of its never taking place. Lady Grey&s;tock, at la&s;t relinqui&s;hed her attempts at betraying Amanda into a confe&s;&s;ion of her &s;entiments: indeed, &s;he thought &s;uch a confe&s;&s;ion not very requi&s;ite, as her countenance pret|ty clearly developed what they were; and &s;he deemed her&s;elf authorized to inform the Marchione&s;s, that &s;he was &s;ure &s;omething had pa&s;&s;ed between Lord Mortimer and Amanda, though what &s;he could not di&s;cover, from the circum&s;pection of the latter. The Marchione&s;s was enraged, and more determined than ever on involving Amanda in de&s;truction, if Lord Mortimer he&s;itated a moment in obeying the wi&s;hes of his father, by uniting him&s;elf to Lady Euphra&s;ia.</P>

<P>A MONTH after the departure of Lord Mortimer, the Ro&s;line family left Ul&s;ter Lodge. A|manda &s;ighed as &s;he &s;aw them pa&s;s, at the idea of the approaching meeting, which might, perhaps, &s;oon be followed by an event, that would render her fond re|membrance of Lord Mortimer improper. Many of the families about the ca&s;tle were already gone to town for the winter. Tho&s;e who remained in the country till af|ter Chri&s;tinas, among whom were the Kilcorbans, had
<PB N="51" REF="038416_0244_1011E30A2FB03C98">
&s;o entirely neglected Amanda, from the time the Mar|chione&s;s arrived in the neighbourhood, that they could not think of renewing their vi&s;its, confident as they were, from the proper dignity of her and Fitzalan's manner, that they would be unwelcome.</P>
<P>The weather was now often too &s;evere to permit A|manda to take her u&s;ual rambles: and the &s;olitude of the ca&s;tle was heightened by her own melancholy ideas, as well as by the drearine&s;s of the &s;ea&s;on. No more the magic hand of hope &s;ketched &s;cenes of flattering bright|ne&s;s, to di&s;&s;ipate the gloomine&s;s of the pre&s;ent ones. The pro&s;pects of Amanda's heart were as dreary, as de|&s;olate, as tho&s;e &s;he viewed from the windows of the ca&s;tle. Her u&s;ual avocations no longer yielded delight; every idea, every occupation, was embittered by the re|flection of being le&s;&s;ened in the e&s;timation of Lord Mortimer. Her health declined with her peace, and again Fitzalan had the angui&s;h of &s;eeing &s;orrow nip|ping his lovely blo&s;&s;om; the ro&s;e for&s;ook her cheek, and her form a&s;&s;umed a fragile delicacy, which threaten|ed the demolition of his earthly happine&s;s. He was not ignorant of the cau&s;e of her dejection, but he would not &s;hock her feelings by hinting it. Every effort which tenderne&s;s could &s;ugge&s;t, he a&s;&s;ayed to cheer her, but without any durable effect; for though &s;he &s;miled when he expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h to &s;ee her cheerful, it was a &s;mile, tran&s;ient as the gleamings of a wintry &s;un, and which only rendered the &s;ucceeding gloom more con&s;picuous.</P>
<P>At this period of di&s;tre&s;s, Lady Grey&s;tock, who, con|tinued her vi&s;its at the ca&s;tle, made a propo&s;al which Fitzalan eagerly embraced; this was to take Amanda with her to London, whither &s;he was obliged to go di|rectly, about a law-&s;uit carrying on between her and the nephew of her late hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Change of &s;cene, Fitzalan tru&s;ted, would remove from Amanda's mind the dejection which oppre&s;&s;ed it, and con&s;equently aid the re&s;toration of her health. Of Lord Mortimer's renewing his addre&s;&s;es, he had not the &s;light|e&s;t apprehen&s;ion, as he neglected the opportunities he might have had in the country for &s;uch a purpo&s;e. Fitz|alan,
<PB N="52" REF="038416_0245_1011E30DDE7AB818">
it may be remembered, knew not that his lord&s;hip had ever deviated from his indifference, and he believed it occa&s;ioned by a transfer of his affections to Lady Eu|phra&s;ia; he was al&s;o ignorant of the great intimacy between the Ro&s;line family and Lady Grey&s;tock, and con&s;equently of the probability there was from &s;uch an intimacy, of Amanda's being often in the way of Lord Mortimer. If &s;he met him, he was confident it would be as the hu&s;band, or favoured lover of Lady Euphra&s;ia: and in either of the&s;e characters, he was certain, from the rectitude and purity of her principles, &s;he would be more than ever impre&s;&s;ed with the nece&s;&s;ity of conquer|ing her attachment; whil&s;t the pain attending &s;uch a conviction would be le&s;&s;ened, and probably &s;oon removed, by &s;urrounding objects, and the gay &s;cenes &s;he mu&s;t en|gage in, from being the companion of Lady Grey&s;tock, who had a numerous and elegant acquaintance in London.</P>
<P>Her Lady&s;hip appeared to him, as &s;he did to many others, a plea&s;ing, rational woman; one to who&s;e care his heart's be&s;t trea&s;ure might &s;afely be con&s;igned. He was induced to accept her protection for his Amanda, not only on account of her pre&s;ent, but future welfare. His own health was extremely delicate; he deemed his life very precarious, and flattered him&s;elf Lady Grey|&s;tock, by having his beloved girl under her care, would grow &s;o attached to her, as to prove a friend if he &s;hould be &s;natched away, ere his newly obtained independence, enabled him to make a provi&s;ion for her: in indulging, this hope&punc; his heart could not reproach him for any thing mean or &s;elfi&s;h. Her lady&s;hip had frequently a&s;&s;ured him all her relations were very di&s;tant ones, and in afflu|ent circum&s;tances, &s;o that if his Amanda received any proof of kindne&s;s from her, &s;he could neither injure or encroach on the rights of others.</P>
<P>This, however, was not the ca&s;e, though carefully concealed from him, as well as many others, by her La|dy&s;hip. Her education had either given birth to, or &s;trengthened the artful propen&s;ities of her di&s;po&s;ition. She had been one of the numerous offspring of a gentle|man in the &s;outhern part of Ireland, who&s;e wife, a com|plete

hou&s;ewife, knowing his inability of giving his daughters fortunes, determined to bring them up &s;o as to &s;ave one for their future hu&s;bands.</P>
<P>At the age of nineteen Mi&s;s Bridget, by her reputa|tion for dome&s;tic cleverne&s;s, attracted the notice of a man of ea&s;y independance, in the neighbourhood, who being a perfect Nimrod, wanted &s;omebody to manage tho&s;e concerns at home, which he neglected for the field and kennel; and in obtaining Mi&s;s Bridget, he procur|ed this valuable acqui&s;ition. His love of &s;port, with his life, was fatally terminated the &s;econd year of his mar|riage, by his attempting no leap a five-bar gate. A good jointure devolved to his widow, and the office of con&s;oling her to the rector of the pari&s;h, a little fat elderly man, who might have &s;at very well for the pic|ture of Boniface. So &s;ucce&s;sful were his arguments, that he not only expelled &s;orrow from her heart, but in|truduced him&s;elf into it, and had the felicity of receiving her ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> as &s;oon as her weeds were laid a&s;ide. Four years <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> had lived in uninterrupted peace; but too free an enjoyment of the good things of this life, undermin|ed the con&s;titution of the rector; he was ordered to Bath, where his mortal career was &s;hortly terminated and his whole fortune was left to his wife.</P>
<P>In the hou&s;e where &s;he lodged was an ancient Baron|et, who had never been married; his fortune was con|&s;iderable, but his manner &s;o &s;trange and whim&s;ical, that he appeared incapable of enjoying the advantages it would have afforded to others. Notwith&s;tanding his oddities, he was compa&s;&s;ionate; and as the fair relict was unaccompanied by a friend, he waited on her for the purpo&s;e of offering con&s;olation, and any &s;ervice in his power. This attention in&s;tantly in&s;pired her with an idea of trying to make him feel tenderer &s;entiments than tho&s;e of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> for her. His title and fortune were &s;o at|tractive, that neither his capricious di&s;po&s;ition, or the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of their ages, he being &s;ixty, and &s;he only eight and twenty, could prevent her ardently de&s;iring a connection between them. Her efforts to effect this were long un&s;ucce&s;&s;ful: but per&s;everance will almo&s;t

<P>The pre&s;umptive heir to the Baronet's large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, was the &s;on and only child of a decea&s;ed &s;i&s;ter. At the period this unexpected alliance took place, he was about twenty, plea&s;ing in his per&s;on, and engaging in his man|ner, and tenderly beloved by his uncle. This love Lady Grey&s;tock &s;aw, if it continued, would fru&s;trate her wi&s;h of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the Baro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">et's whole property. Various &s;chemes fluctuated in her mind, relative to the manner in which &s;he &s;hould lay the foundation for Ru&s;hbrook's ru|in; ere &s;he could determine on one, chance di&s;covered a &s;ecret, which completely aided her intentions.</P>
<P>In the neighbourhood of the Baronet's country re&s;i|dence, Ru&s;hbrook had formed an attachment for the daughter of a man, again&s;t whom his uncle entertained the mo&s;t inveterate enmity. An union with this girl, &s;he was well convinced, would ruin him. She therefore gave him to under&s;tand &s;he knew of his attachment, and &s;incerely pitied his &s;ituation; encouraging his love by the mo&s;t flattering eulogiums on his adored Emily; declared her regret that hearts, &s;o congenial &s;hould be &s;eparated; and at la&s;t intimated, that if they wi&s;hed to unite, &s;he was convinced &s;he would &s;oon be able to ob|tain Sir Geoffry's forgivene&s;s for &s;uch a &s;tep. Her art|ful in&s;inuations hurried the un&s;u&s;picious pair into the &s;nare &s;he had &s;pread for them; the con&s;equence of this was what &s;he expected.</P>
<P>Sir Geoffry's rage was unappea&s;able, and he &s;olemnly vowed never more to behold his nephew. Lady Grey|&s;tock wi&s;hed to pre&s;erve, if po&s;&s;ible, appearances to the world, and prevailed on him to give her five hundred pounds for Ru&s;hbrook, to which &s;he added five of her own, and pre&s;ented the notes to him, with an a&s;&s;urance of pleading his cau&s;e whenever &s;he found a favourable opportunity for doing &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="038416_0248_1011E3156BED25D0">
He purcha&s;ed an en&s;igncy in a regiment, on the point of embarking for America, where he felt he would ra|ther encounter di&s;tre&s;s, than among tho&s;e who had known him in affluence.</P>
<P>Her lady&s;hip now redoubled her attention to Sir Geof|fry, and at la&s;t prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him &s;o &s;trongly with the idea of her affection for him, that he made a will be|queathing her his whole fortune, which &s;he flattered her&s;elf with &s;oon enjoying. But the con&s;titution of Sir Geoffry was &s;tronger than &s;he imagined, and policy obliged her to adhere to a conduct which had gained his favour; as &s;he knew the lea&s;t alteration in it would to his capricious temper, be &s;ufficient to make him cru&s;h all her hopes.</P>
<P>Fifteen years pa&s;&s;ed in this manner, when a friend of Ru&s;hbrook's advi&s;ed him no longer to be deluded by the promi&s;es Lady Grey&s;tock &s;till continued to make, of interceding in his favour, but to write him&s;elf to his uncle for forgivene&s;s, which the duty he owed his fa|mily, and the di&s;tre&s;s of his &s;ituation, &s;hould prompt him to immediately. Ru&s;hbrook accordingly wrote a mo&s;t pathetic letter, and his friend, as he had promi&s;ed, delivered it him&s;elf to the baronet. The contents of the letter, and the remon&s;trance of his vi&s;itor, produced a great change in the &s;entiments of the Baronet. Ten|derne&s;s for a nephew, he had adopted as his heir from his infancy, began to revive, and he &s;eriou&s;ly reflected that by leaving his fortune to Lady Grey&s;tock, he &s;hould enrich a family unconnected with him, whil&s;t the la&s;t branch of his own was left to ob&s;curity and wretchedne&s;s. Pride recoiled from &s;uch an idea, and he told the gentleman he would con&s;ider about a recon|ciliation with his nephew.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation between them, which Lady Grey|&s;tock had contrived to overhear, filled her with di&s;may; but this was increa&s;ed almo&s;t to di&s;traction, when an attorney being &s;ent for, &s;he repaired again to her hi|ding place, and heard a new will dictated, entirely in Ru&s;hbrook's favour.</P>
<P>Sir Geoffry was &s;oon prevailed on to &s;ee his nephew,
<PB N="56" REF="038416_0249_1011E31806D2D768">
but Mrs. Ru&s;hbrook and the children were not &s;uffered to appear before him: they were, however, &s;upplied with every thing requi&s;ite for making a genteel appear|ance; and accompanying the regiment (again ordered abroad) with comfort.</P>
<P>Soon after their departure, Sir Geoffry &s;unk into a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility, from which no hopes of his ever recovering could be entertained. The &s;ituation was propitious, to the de&s;igns of Lady Grey&s;tock: none but creatures of her own were admitted to his chamber. An attorney was &s;ent for, who had often tran&s;acted bu|&s;ine&s;s for her, relative to her affairs in Ireland; and a good bribe ea&s;ily prevailed on him to draw up a will &s;he dictated, &s;imilar to that before made in her favour. The Baronet was rai&s;ed in her arms, whil&s;t the attorney guid|ed his almo&s;t lifele&s;s hand in &s;igning it; and two clerks &s;et their names as witne&s;&s;es. Sir Geoffry expired al|mo&s;t immediately after this &s;cheme was executed.</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook's friend, who had been appointed to act for him, if this event took place whil&s;t he was abroad, now appeared. A will found in Sir Geoffry's cabinet was read, by which it appeared Mr. Ru&s;hbrook was his &s;ole heir. The exultation of the peru&s;er, however, was of &s;hort continuance; her lady&s;hip's attorney appeared, and declared the will was rendered null, by one of la|ter date, which he had drawn up in Sir Geoffry's la&s;t moments, by his expre&s;s de&s;ire. Con&s;ternation and &s;urpri&s;e pervaded the mind of Ru&s;hbrook's friend; he &s;aw the will was too well atte&s;ted for him to di&s;pute it; yet he &s;u&s;pected foul play, and lo&s;t no time in commu|nicating his &s;u&s;picion to Ru&s;hbrook.</P>
<P>Her Lady&s;hip &s;ettled her affairs mo&s;t expeditiou&s;ly, and returned with delight to her native country, after a very long ab&s;ence from it. Mo&s;t of her near relations were dead, but &s;he had many di&s;tant ones, who, prompt|ed by the knowledge of her large fortune, eagerly re|minded her of their affinity, and vied with each other in paying her attention. This was extremely plea&s;ing to her Lady&s;hip, who was fond of plea&s;ure at other people's expence. For her&s;elf &s;he had laid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">own rules
<PB N="57" REF="038416_0250_1011E31B9AC2C0F8">
of the mo&s;t rigid oeconomy, which &s;he &s;trictly adhered to. From the many invitations &s;he received, &s;he was &s;eldom a re&s;ident in her own hou&s;e; &s;he judged of others by her&s;elf, and a&s;cribed the attentions &s;he received, to their real &s;ource, &s;elf-intere&s;t, which &s;he laughed &s;e|cretly to think &s;he &s;hould di&s;appoint.</P>
<P>She was remarkable (as Mi&s;s Kilcorban informed A|manda) for a&s;king young people to do little matters for her, &s;uch as making her millenery, working ruffles, aprons and handkerchiefs.</P>
<P>The tranquility &s;he enjoyed for two years after Sir Geoffry's death, was a little interrupted by his nephew's arrival from America, and commencing a &s;uit directly again&s;t her, by the advice of his friends, and &s;ome emi|nent lawyers, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the will, by which &s;he inherited, had been made when his uncle was in a &s;tate of imbecility.</P>
<P>Lady Grey&s;tock, however, received but a trifling &s;hock from this; &s;he knew he had no money to carry on &s;uch an affair, and that his advocates would lo&s;e their zeal in his cau&s;e, when convinced of the &s;tate of his fi|nances. On being obliged to go to London to attend the &s;uit, it immediately occurred that Amanda would be a mo&s;t plea&s;ing companion to take along with her, as &s;he would not only enliven the ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rs &s;he mu&s;t &s;ome|times pa&s;s at home, but do a number of little things in the way of dre&s;s, which would &s;ave a great deal of expence.</P>
<P>Amanda, on the fir&s;t propo&s;al of accompanying her, warmly oppo&s;ed it; &s;he felt unutterable reluctance to leave her father, and a&s;&s;ured him &s;he would, by exert|ing her&s;elf, prove that a change of &s;cene was not requi|&s;ite for re&s;toring her cheerfulne&s;s. Fitzalan knew her &s;incerity in making this promi&s;e, but he al&s;o knew her inability of performing it: his happine&s;s he declared depended on her complying with his reque&s;t: he even &s;aid his own health would probably be e&s;tabli&s;hed by it, as during her ab&s;ence he would partake of the amu&s;e|ments of the country, which he had hitherto declined
<PB N="58" REF="038416_0251_1011E31D2A430FB0">
on her account. This a&s;&s;ertion prevailed on her to con|&s;ent, and immediate preparations were made for her journey, as the invitation had not been given till within a few days of her Lady&s;hip's intended departure. As &s;he went by Holyhead&punc; Fitzalan determined on &s;ending Ellen to her parents, till Amanda returned from En|gland, which determination plea&s;ed Ellen exceedingly, as &s;he longed to &s;ee her family, and tell them particu|lars of Chip. As the hour approached for quitting her father, the regret and reluctance of Amanda increa&s;ed; nor were his feelings le&s;s oppre&s;&s;ive, though better concealed; but when the moment of parting came, they could no longer be &s;uppre&s;t; he held her with a trembling gra&s;p to his brea&s;t, as if life would for&s;ake it. On her departure, the gloom on his mind &s;eemed like a pre&s;entiment of evil; he repented forcing her from him, and &s;carcely could he refrain from &s;aying, they mu&s;t not part.</P>
<P>Lady Grey&s;tock, who in every &s;cene, and every &s;i|tuation, pre&s;erved her compo&s;ure hinted to him the in|jury he was doing his daughter, by &s;uch emotions, and mentioned how &s;hort their &s;eparation would be, and what benefits would accrue to Amanda from it.</P>
<P>This la&s;t con&s;ideration recalled to his mind, in&s;tantly compo&s;ed him, and he handed them to her Lady&s;hip's chariot, which was followed by a hired chai&s;e, contain|ing her woman and Ellen; he then &s;ighed her a la&s;t adieu, returned to his &s;olitary habitation to pray, and in &s;pite of all his efforts, weep for his darling child.</P>
<P>Amanda's tears &s;treamed down her pale cheek, and never did &s;he experience a pang of &s;uch &s;orrow as that &s;he felt, when the chai&s;e de&s;cending a hill, &s;he caught the la&s;t glimp&s;e of Ca&s;tle Carb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rry.</P>
<P>She perceived, however, that her Lady&s;hip had no reli&s;h for a gloomy companion, and therefore endeavour|ed to recover her &s;pirits and enter into conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Lady Grey&s;tock had a number of friends in that part of Ireland, and therefore never &s;topt at an inn.</P>

<P>They arrived the third day in Sackville &s;treet, where her Lady&s;hip had a hou&s;e, and two days after embarked for England. They &s;lept the fir&s;t night they landed at Holy head, and the next morning pur&s;ued their journey.</P>

<P>THE dejection of Amanda gradually declined, as the idea of &s;eeing Lord Mortimer again re|vived. It revived not, however, without hopes, fears, and agitations. Sometimes &s;he imagined &s;he &s;hould find him devoted to Lady Euphra&s;ia; then again believ|ed his honour and &s;incerity would not allow him to give her up to &s;uddenly, and that this apparent indifference proceeded from re&s;entment, which would vani&s;h, if an opportunity once offered (and &s;he tru&s;ted there would) for explaining her conduct.

<P>They &s;topped for the night, about five o'clock, at an inn about a mile from Tudor Hall. After dinner Aman|da informed Lady Grey&s;tock, &s;he wi&s;hed to accompany Ellen to her parents. To this her Lady&s;hip made no objection, on finding &s;he did not want the carriage. She charged her, however, not to forget the hour of te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, by which time &s;he would be refre&s;hed by a nap, and rea|dy to engage her at a game of picquet.</P>

They &s;et out unattended, as Ellen <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">efu&s;ed the o&s;tler's offer of carrying her portmanteau, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ying "&s;he would &s;end for it the next day." This &s;he did by Amanda's de&s;ire who wi&s;hed, unob&s;erved, to pur&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e a walk, in which &s;he promi&s;ed her&s;elf a melancholy indulgence, from reviewing the well known &s;cenes, endeared by tender recollections.</P>
<P>A mournful, yet not undelightful &s;en&s;ation, attends the contemplation of &s;cenes, where we once enjoyed feli|city:&mdash;departed joys are ever remembered with an en|thu&s;ia&s;m of tenderne&s;s, which &s;oothes the &s;orrow we ex|perience for their lo&s;s.</P>
<P>Such were the pre&s;ent feelings of Amanda; while El|len undi&s;turbed by regrets for the pa&s;t, pointed out, with plea&s;ure, the dwellings of her intimates and friends. Yet when &s;he came to Chip's de&s;erted cottage, &s;he &s;top|ped, and a tear &s;tole from her eye, accompanied at the &s;ame time by a &s;mile, which &s;eemed to &s;ay, though thou art now lonely and cheerle&s;s, the period is approaching when comfort and gaiety &s;hall re&s;ume their &s;tations with|in thee, when the blaze of thy fire and thy taper, &s;hall not only diffu&s;e cheerfulne&s;s within, but without, and give a ray to the de&s;olate or benighted traveller, to guide him to thy ho&s;pitable &s;helter.</P>
<P>Amanda, leaning on Ellen's arm, proceeded &s;lowly in her walk; the evening was delightful; the blue vault of heaven was &s;pangled with &s;tars, and the air, without being &s;everely cold, was clear and refre&s;hing. Their road, on one &s;ide, was &s;kirted with the high woods of Tudor Hall. Amanda gazed on them with emotion; but when &s;he came to the gate which Lord Mortimer had opened for her departure at the fir&s;t interview, the &s;oftne&s;s of her heart could no longer be re&s;i&s;ted: &s;he &s;topped, leaned pen&s;ively upon it, and wept. The ever|greens, with which the woods abounded, prevented their wearing a de&s;olate appearance: &s;he wi&s;hed to have pierced into their mo&s;t &s;eque&s;tered gloom, but &s;he had no time to indulge this wi&s;h; nor did &s;he, indeed, be|lieve her companion, who was tinctured with &s;uper&s;ti|tious fears, would have accompanied her. "When the
<PB N="61" REF="038416_0254_1011E3249A6FAF58">
glow of vegetation again revives," &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf, "when the blo&s;&s;om and the flowers again &s;pread their &s;pangled foliage to the &s;un, and every &s;hade re&s;ounds with harmony, where, alas! will Amanda be?&mdash;Far di&s;tant, in all probability, from the&s;e delightful &s;cenes, perhaps neglected and forgotten by their ma&s;ter."</P>
<P>The awful murmurs of the wind ru&s;tling through the trees, joined to the &s;olemn &s;ound of a neighbouring wa|terfall, began to excite fears in Ellen's brea&s;t. She laid her trembling hand on Amanda, and be&s;ought her, for the love of Cot, to ha&s;ten to the cottage. The road &s;till wound round the wood, and lights from a &s;mall vil|lage, which lay on its borders, ca&s;t various &s;hadows upon the trees, whil&s;t the hum of di&s;tant voices floated upon the gale, and fancy pictured joyous groups of ru&s;tics a&s;|&s;embling round their fires, to enjoy refre&s;hment after the labours of the day.</P>
<P>"Peaceful people," &s;aid Amanda, "when the wants of nature are &s;atisfied, no care or trouble obtrudes upon your minds: tired, but not exhau&s;ted with the toils of the day, with preparing the bo&s;om of the earth for the etherial mildne&s;s of the &s;pring, you &s;eek and enjoy a calm repo&s;e."</P>
<P>In the lane which led to her nur&s;e's cottage, Amanda pau&s;ed for a moment: down this lane Lord Mortimer had once pur&s;ued her: &s;he looked towards the man&s;ion of Tudor Hall; &s;he endeavoured to di&s;cern the library, but all was dark and di&s;mal, except the wing, which El|len informed her was occupied by the dome&s;tics. Thro' the window of Edwin's cottage, they &s;aw all the family &s;itting round a blazing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, chatting and laughing. The tran&s;port of Ellen's heart overcame every idea of cau|tion; &s;he ha&s;tily unlatched the door, and flung her&s;elf into her parents' arms: their &s;urpri&s;e and joy was un|bounded, and Amanda was received and welcomed with as much tenderne&s;s as their child, without ever a&s;king the rea&s;on of her &s;udden appearance. The fir&s;t que&s;tion was, "Would &s;he not &s;tay with them?" and her an&s;wer filled them with regret and di&s;appointment. Perceiving
<PB N="62" REF="038416_0255_1011E326FA278ED8">
them about procuring her refre&s;hments, "&s;he declared &s;he had not a minute to &s;tay: the time alotted for her walk was already exceeded, and &s;he feared Lady Grey|&s;tock would be offended at being left &s;o long at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> by her&s;elf;" &s;he therefore ha&s;tily pre&s;ented &s;ome little pre&s;ents &s;he had brought for the family, and was bidding them farewell, when poor Ellen, who, from &s;o long re|&s;iding with her young lady, almo&s;t adored <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">er, &s;uddenly flung her&s;elf into her arms, and clinging round her neck, as if to prevent a &s;eparation; which, till the moment of its arrival, &s;he thought &s;he could have &s;upported, ex|claimed.</P>
<P>"Oh, my tear young lady, we are going to part, and my heart &s;inks within me at the idea: even Chip him|&s;elf, if he was here, could not con&s;ole me. I know you are not happy, and that increa&s;es my &s;orrow: your &s;weet cheek is pale, and I have often &s;een you cry, when you thought no poty was minding you; if you who are &s;o goot are not happy, how can a peing like me hope to be &s;o. Oh, may I &s;oon pe ble&s;t with &s;eeing you return the mi&s;tre&s;s of Tudor Hall, married to the &s;weete&s;t, hand|&s;ome&s;t of noblemen&mdash;who I know, in my &s;oul, loves you, as well inteed he may, for where would he &s;ee the fellow of my young laty. Then Chip and I will be &s;o happy, for I am &s;ure you and my lort will &s;helter our humble cottage."</P>
<P>Amanda pre&s;t the affectionate girl to her brea&s;t, and mingled tears with her's, while &s;he &s;oftly whi&s;pered to her not to hint at &s;uch an event; "but be a&s;&s;ured, my deare&s;t Ellen," continued &s;he, "that I &s;hall ever rejoice at your felicity, which, to the utmo&s;t of my power, I would promote, and hope &s;oon to hear of your union with Chip."</P>
<P>"Alack a tay," &s;aid her nur&s;e," are you going away, when I thought you come to &s;tay among us; and then, perhaps my lort would have come, and then there would have peen &s;uch a happy meeting; why, I verily thought he would have gone di&s;tracted when he found you, as one may &s;ay, run away; and to pe &s;ure I did pity him, and &s;hould have made no &s;cruple to tell him where you

were, had I known it my&s;elf, which he &s;u&s;pected, for he offered me a &s;ight of money if I would di&s;cover. Then there is par&s;on Howell, why he has peen like un|to nothing put a gho&s;t &s;ince you went away; and he does &s;o &s;igh&mdash;and he comes almo&s;t every tay to a&s;k me apout you, and whether I think or know Lort Morti|mer is with you; he will be in &s;uch grief to think you were here without his &s;eeing you."</P>
<P>"Well", &s;aid Amanda, endeavouring to appear cheer|ful, "we may all yet have a happy meeting."</P>
<P>She then repeated her farewell, and leaning on the arm of old Edwin, returned to the inn, where &s;he again bid him adieu; and ha&s;tening to her Lady&s;hip, &s;ound her ju&s;t awkening from a comfortable &s;lumber. They drank tea, and after playing for about an hour at piquet, retired to re&s;t. Amanda, who enjoyed but little re|po&s;e, ro&s;e early in the morning, and finding her Lady|&s;hip not quite ready, went down to the court to walk about till &s;he was, where, to her great &s;urpri&s;e, the fir&s;t object &s;he perceived was Howell, leaning pen&s;ively again&s;t a gate oppo&s;ite the hou&s;e. He flew over, and catching her hand, exclaimed,</P>
<P>"You are &s;urpri&s;ed, but I tru&s;t not di&s;plea&s;ed: I could not re&s;i&s;t &s;uch an opportunity of &s;eeing you once more, after all I have &s;uffered from your precipitate journey, and the probability of never beholding you. I have been watching here, in expectation of this happine&s;s, &s;ince the fir&s;t dawn of day."</P>
<P>"I am &s;orry," &s;aid Amanda, gravely, "your time was &s;o ill employed."</P>
<P>"How coldly you &s;peak," cried he, "ah! could you read my heart, you would &s;ee &s;o little pre&s;umption in it, that you would, I am confident, pity, though you could not relieve, its feelings. Every &s;pot you loved to frequent, I have haunted &s;ince your departure: your mother's grave has often been the &s;cene of pen&s;ive me|ditation; nor has it wanted its vernal offering; the lovelie&s;t flowers of my garden I have wove into wreaths, and hung them o'er it, in fond remembrance of her an|gel daughter."</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="038416_0257_1011E32B43968C70">
The plaintive &s;ound of Howell's voice; the dejecti|on of his countenance, excited the &s;ofte&s;t feelings of &s;en&s;ibility in Amanda's bo&s;om; but &s;he grew confu&s;ed by the tenderne&s;s of his expre&s;&s;ion, and &s;aying &s;he was happy to &s;ee him, tried to di&s;engage her hand, that &s;he might retire.</P>
<P>"Surely," &s;aid he, &s;till detaining it, "a few moments you might grant me without reluctance: you who are going to enjoy every happine&s;s and plea&s;ure, going to meet the favoured&mdash;"</P>
<P>Amanda anticipated the name he was about uttering, and her confu&s;ion redoubled. She attempted again, yet in vain, to withdraw her hand, and turned to &s;ee whether any one was ob&s;erving them; how great was her morti|fication, on perceiving Lady Grey&s;tock leaning from a window, exactly over their heads. She &s;miled &s;ignifi|cantly at Amanda, on being &s;een; and the carriage be|ing ready, &s;aid, "&s;he would attend her below &s;tairs." Howell now relinqui&s;hed Amanda's hand; he &s;aw &s;he looked di&s;plea&s;ed; and expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch &s;orrow, accom|panied with &s;uch &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive apologies for offending her that &s;he could not avoid according him her pardon. He handed both her and Lady Grey&s;tock into the carriage, and looked a melancholy adieu as it drove off.</P>
<P>"Upon my word, a pretty &s;mart young fellow," &s;aid Lady Grey&s;tock:&mdash;"though impatient this long time to &s;et out, I could not think of interrupting the inter|e&s;ting tete-a-tete I &s;aw between you and him. I &s;up|po&s;e you have been a re&s;ident in this part of the co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">try before from your &s;eeming to know this tender &s;wain &s;o well."</P>
<P>Amanda wi&s;hed to avoid acknowledging this&mdash;if known, &s;he feared it would lead to a di&s;covery, or at lea&s;t excite a &s;u&s;picion of her intimacy with Lord Mor|timer, which &s;he was de&s;irous of concealing, while in this uncertainty concerning him.</P>
<P>"Your Lady&s;hip has heard, I believe," replied &s;he, "that Ellen's mother nur&s;ed me."</P>
<P>"Yes, my dear," an&s;wered her lady&s;hip, with &s;ome &s;martne&s;s; but if your acquaintance even commenced
<PB N="65" REF="038416_0258_1011E32F4CA09AE0">
with this youth in infancy, I fancy it has been renew|ed &s;ince that period."</P>
<P>Amanda blu&s;hed deeply, and to hide her confu&s;ion, pretended to be looking at the pro&s;pect from the win|dow. Lady Grey&s;tock's eyes pur&s;ued her's. Tudor Hall was con&s;picuous from the road, and Amanda invol|untarily &s;ighed as &s;he viewed it.</P>
<P>"That is a fine domain," &s;aid lady Grey&s;tock," I pre&s;ume you have vi&s;ited it, and know its owner?"</P>
<P>Amanda could not a&s;&s;ert a fal&s;ehood; neither could &s;he evade the enquiries of Lady Grey&s;tock, and there|fore not only confe&s;&s;ed its being the e&s;tate of Lord Mor|timer but her own re&s;idence near it, the preceding &s;um|mer. Her lady&s;hip immediately conjectured it was then the attachment between her and Lord Mortimer had commenced; and the blu&s;hes, the he&s;itation, and the unwillingne&s;s of Amanda, in owning her vi&s;it to Wales all confirmed this conjecture. She tried, however, to in&s;inuate her&s;elf into her full confidence, by warm ex|pre&s;&s;ions of e&s;teem, and by hinting, that from the di&s;|po&s;ition of Lord Mortimer, &s;he could not believe he ever did, or ever would think &s;eriou&s;ly of lady Euphra&s;ia; this &s;he hoped would either induce or betray Amanda to open her whole heart, but &s;he was di&s;appointed. She flattered her&s;elf, however, with thinking &s;he had di&s;co|vered enough to &s;atisfy the Marchione&s;s, if &s;he, (as Lady Grey&s;tock feared &s;he would) expre&s;&s;ed any di&s;approba|tion at &s;eeing Amanda her companion; &s;he intended &s;aying, that Fitzalan had ab&s;olutely forced her under her protection.</P>
<P>They arrived late in the evening of the third day at Pall-Mall, where her Lady&s;hip's agent had previou&s;ly taken lodgings for them.</P>
<P>Lady Grey&s;tock, though immer&s;ed in bu&s;ine&s;s again&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the approaching trial, neglected no means of amu&s;e|ment; and the day after her arrival &s;ent a card of en|quiry to the Ro&s;line family, as the mo&s;t eligible mode of informing them of it. The next morning, as &s;he ex|pected, &s;he received a vi&s;it from them. Amanda was &s;itting in the window when the carriage drove up to the
<PB N="66" REF="038416_0259_1011E330DA1CCC98">
door; &s;he in&s;tantly aro&s;e, and left the room, determin|ed neither to expo&s;e her&s;elf to their impertinence, or appear &s;olicitous for their notice, by &s;taying in their company uninvited. Lady Grey&s;tock &s;oon informed them of Amanda's having accompanied her to London; and they, as &s;he expected, expre&s;s both &s;urprize and di&s;|plea&s;ure at it. As &s;he had &s;ettled in her own mind, &s;he therefore told them, "that Fitzalan had urged her to take his daughter under her care, with entreaties &s;he could not re&s;i&s;t: entreaties," &s;he added with a &s;ignificant lock, "&s;he believed he had good rea&s;on for making." She then related all &s;he &s;u&s;pected, or rather had di&s;co|vered, relative to the attachment between Lord Morti|mer and Amanda having commenced the preceding &s;um|mer in Wales.</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s and Lady Euphra&s;ia in&s;tantly con|cluded &s;he was &s;ent to London for the purpo&s;e of having it completed by a marriage. This, however, they deter|mined to prevent. The Marchione&s;s felt the mo&s;t inve|terate hatred again&s;t her, and al&s;o that to prevent her being advantageou&s;ly &s;ettled, even if that &s;ettlement threatened not to interfere with the one &s;he had project|ed for her daughter, &s;he could undertake almo&s;t any pro|ject. Though &s;he abhorred the idea of noticing her, yet &s;he was tempted now to do &s;o, from the idea that it would better enable her to watch her actions. This idea &s;he communicated in a ha&s;ty whi&s;per to Lady Euphra&s;ia, who approving it, &s;he told Lady Grey&s;tock, "as Mi&s;s Fitzalan was her gue&s;t, &s;he would, on that account, permit her to be introduced to them." Amanda was accordingly &s;ent for. On entering the room, Lady Grey&s;tock took her hand, and pre&s;ented her to the Mar|chione&s;s and Lady Euphra&s;ia. The former, half ri&s;ing, with a coldne&s;s &s;he could not conquer, &s;aid, "Whene|ver Lady Grey&s;tock honoured her with a vi&s;it, &s;he &s;hould be happy to &s;ee Mi&s;s Fitzalan along with her." The latter only noticed her by a &s;light bow; and when Amanda drew a chair near the &s;ofa on which &s;he &s;at, or rather reclined, &s;he continued &s;taring in her face, and alternately humming an Italian air, and care&s;&s;ing
<PB N="67" REF="038416_0260_1011E3336EBD8F98">
a little dog &s;he had brought with her. The unembar|ra&s;&s;ed elegance of Amanda's air and manner, &s;urpri&s;ed and mortified them; as they expected to have &s;een her covered with confu&s;ion, at an introduction &s;o unexpected. To their haughty &s;ouls nothing was more delightful than the awe and deference which vulgar and illiberal minds are &s;o apt to pay to rank and fortune. They were provok|ed to &s;ee in Amanda, con&s;cious dignity, in&s;tead of trem|bling diffidence. As &s;he &s;at by Lady Euphra&s;ia, the Mar|chione&s;s could not help &s;ecretly confe&s;&s;ing &s;he was a dan|gerous rival to her daughter: for never did her lovely features, and ingenuous countenance, appear to &s;uch ad|vantage, as when contra&s;ted to Lady Euphra&s;ia's. The Marchione&s;s withdrew &s;oon after her entrance, unable longer to re&s;train the malignant pa&s;&s;ions which envy had excited.</P>
<P>Both &s;he and Lady Euphra&s;ia were convinced that to communicate their &s;u&s;picions at pre&s;ent to Lord Cherbu|ry, about her and his &s;on, would not an&s;wer the end pro|po&s;ed: for it could be of little con&s;equence, they reflect|ed, to withdraw the e&s;teem of the father, if that of the &s;on's continued: who independent in his notions, and certain of the fortunes of his ance&s;tors, might not he&s;itate to gratify him&s;elf. The point therefore was, by &s;ome deep laid &s;cheme, to ruin Amanda in the e&s;ti|mation of Lord Mortimer: and if in the power of mor|tals to contrive and execute &s;uch a &s;cheme, they gave them&s;elves credit for being able to effect it.</P>
<P>The blow at her fond hopes, they re&s;olved &s;hould be followed by one again&s;t the peace of Fitzalan, on whom they knew, whenever they plea&s;ed, they could draw the re&s;entment of Lord Cherbury; thus &s;hould they com|pletely triumph over the lovely Amanda: plunge two beings they dete&s;ted into poverty and wretchedne&s;s: de|&s;troy expectations which interfered with their own, and &s;ecure an alliance with a man, they had long wi&s;hed united to their family.</P>
<P>From the unaltered indifference of Lord Mortimer to Lady Euphra&s;ia, they were convinced of his predilection for another. Flattering them&s;elves that nothing but a
<PB N="68" REF="038416_0261_1011E335EF88BF38">
prior attachment could have rendered him in&s;en&s;ible to the attractions of her lady&s;hip; to render the object of this attachment contemptible in his &s;ight, they believed would produce the tran&s;fer of affections they &s;o long de&s;ired. The haughty &s;oul of lady Euphra&s;ia would never have permitted her to think of accepting Lord Mortimer (after his neglect of her), but by the oppor|tunity &s;he &s;hould have by &s;uch an acceptance of tri|umphing over Amanda; from this idea, &s;he entered warmly into all her mother's plans.</P>
<P>Lord Cherbury had never yet &s;poken explicitly to his &s;on concerning the union he had projected for him; he often, indeed, dropt hints about it, which he always either neglected, or purpo&s;ely mi&s;under&s;tood; and from the&s;e circum&s;tances was pretty &s;en&s;ible of the di&s;|inclination Lord Mortimer felt to his wi&s;hes; he knew he entertained high notions of the independence which a rational mind has a right to maintain, and that in an affair of &s;uch con&s;equence; as Mortimer frequently &s;aid, he con&s;idered matrimonial connection to be, he would neither be controuled by the opinion of others or mere|ly allured by the advantages of fortune.</P>
<P>To avoid a di&s;agreeable argument with a &s;on he not only loved, but re&s;pected, he &s;ought rather, by indirect means, to involve him in an e&s;tabli&s;hment with the Ro&s;line family, than come to an open explanation with him. For this purpo&s;e he contrived parties as often as po&s;&s;ible with them into public; where, by Lord Morti|mer's being &s;een with Lady Euphra&s;ia, reports might be rai&s;ed of an intended alliance between them; reports which he him&s;elf propagated among &s;ome particular friends, with a de&s;ire of having them circulated; but an injunction of &s;ecrecy as to their author; the&s;e reports would he tru&s;ted, on reaching Lord Mortimer, lead to a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the affair: and then he meant to &s;ay, as Lord Mortimer had partly contributed to rai&s;e them him&s;elf, by his attendance on Lady Euphra&s;ia, he could not po&s;&s;ibly, with honour, recede from, realizing them: yet often did his Lord&s;hip fear his &s;cheme would prove abortive; for well he knew the cool judgment and keen
<PB N="69" REF="038416_0262_1011E33858C6F0F8">
penetration of his &s;on: this fear always in&s;pired him with horror, for he had a motive for de&s;iring the union which he dur&s;t not avow.</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer quickly indeed di&s;cerned what his fa|ther's views were, in promoting his attendance on Lady Euphra&s;ia; he therefore avoided her &s;ociety, whenever it was po&s;&s;ible to do &s;o, without ab&s;olute rudene&s;s; and contradicted the reports he almo&s;t continually heard, of an intended alliance between them, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner: he had always di&s;liked her, but latterly that di&s;like was converted into hatred, from the malevolence of her conduct towards Amanda; and he felt, that even was his heart free, he never could devote it to her, or give his hand where it mu&s;t be unaccompanied with e&s;teem; he wi&s;hed to avoid a di&s;agreeable conver&s;ation with Lord Cherbury, and flattered him&s;elf, his unalter|ed indifference to her Lady&s;hip, would at length con|vince his Lord&s;hip of the impo&s;&s;ibility of accompli&s;hing his projected &s;cheme, and that con&s;equently it would be dropt 'ere openly avowed, and he &s;aved the painful nece&s;&s;ity of ab&s;olutely rejecting a propo&s;al of his fa|ther's.</P>
<P>In the evening Lady Grey&s;tock and Amanda received cards for dinner the next day at the Marqui&s;s of Ro&s;line's. Amanda made no objection to this invitation; her father had often declared, if the Marchione&s;s made an over|ture for an intimacy with his children, he would not re|ject it, as he always deemed family quarrels highly pre|judicial to both parties, with regard to the opinion of the world: be&s;ides, had &s;he objected to it, &s;he &s;hould ei|ther have been a re&s;traint on Lady Grey&s;tock, or left to total &s;olitude; and the idea al&s;o &s;tole upon her mind, that &s;he &s;hould lo&s;e a chance of &s;eeing Lord Mortimer, who, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, a frequent gue&s;t of the Marquis's. Her heart flattered at the idea of &s;oon beholding him; and the bright glow of animation which over&s;pread her countenance, in con&s;equence of this idea, attracted the ob&s;ervation of Lady Grey&s;tock, who congratulated her on the alteration that was already vi&s;ible in her looks;

and inferred from thence, that &s;he was &s;o well recovered of her fatigue, as to be able to contrive a little trim|ming for her again&s;t the next day. This Amanda cheer|fully undertook, and having a quick execution, as well as an elegant ta&s;te, &s;he &s;oon made a progre&s;s in it, which delighted her Lady&s;hip; who, to divert her whil&s;t &s;he worked, related &s;ome of the many entertain|ing anecdotes with which her memory was &s;tored.</P>
<P>Though Amanda &s;ubmitted her beautiful hair to the hands of a freizure, &s;he departed not from the elegant &s;implicity always con&s;picuous in her dre&s;s; her little or|naments were all arranged with ta&s;te, and an anxious wi&s;h of appearing to advantage; &s;o lovely indeed did &s;he appear to Lady Grey&s;tock, that her Lady&s;hip be|gan &s;eriou&s;ly to fear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he &s;hould not be forgiven by the Marchione&s;s, or Lady Euphra&s;ia, for having introdu|ced &s;uch an object to their parties.</P>
<P>About &s;ix they reached Portman Square, and found a large party a&s;&s;embled in the drawing room. After the fir&s;t compliments were over and Amanda introduced to the Marquis&mdash;not indeed as a near relation, but an utter &s;tranger, a gentleman &s;tepped up to the Marchione&s;s, and addre&s;&s;ing her in a low voice, was immediately pre|&s;ented by her to Amanda, as the Earl of Cherbury.</P>
<P>"My dear young lady," &s;aid he, "allow me to expre&s;s the plea&s;ure I feel, at &s;eeing the daughter of my worthy friend, Mr. Fitzalan: allow me al&s;o to increa&s;e that plea&s;ure," continued he, taking her hand, and leading her to a very lovely girl, who &s;at at &s;ome di&s;tance, "by pre&s;enting Mi&s;s Fitzalan to Lady Araminta Dormer, and de&s;iring their friend&s;hip for each other."</P>
<P>Surpri&s;ed, confu&s;ed, yet delighted by notice &s;o little expected, the heart of Amanda heaved with emotion: her cheeks mantled with blu&s;hes, and the tear of &s;en&s;i|bility trembled in her eye: &s;he was not, however, &s;o embarra&s;&s;ed, as to be incapable of expre&s;&s;ing her ac|knowledgments to his Lord&s;hip for his attention, and al&s;o to a&s;&s;ure him, &s;he had early been taught, and &s;en&s;i|bly felt the claims he had upon her gratitude and re|&s;pect. He bowed as if to prevent a further mention of
<PB N="71" REF="038416_0264_1011E33DB05BF970">
obligations, and left her &s;eated by his daughter, who had expre&s;&s;ed her plea&s;ure at being introduced to her, not in the &s;upercilious &s;tile of Lady Euphra&s;ia, but in the &s;weet accents of affability and tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>The conduct of Lord Cherbury had drawn all eyes upon Amanda: the Marchione&s;s and Lady Euphra&s;ia regarded her with peculiar malignancy; the idea, how|ever, that they could, whenever they plea&s;ed, deprive her of his notice, a little le&s;&s;ened the jealou&s;y and mor|tification it had excited.</P>
<P>"Pray, who is this little creature?" exclaimed Mi&s;s Malcolm (who wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a relation of the Marquis's, and from being extremely ugly, extremely rich, and ex|tremely ill natured, was animmen&s;e favourite of Lady Euphra&s;ia's) "that puts one in mind of a country mi&s;s, on her fir&s;t appearance at a country a&s;&s;embly, blu&s;hing and trembling at every eye &s;he meets?"</P>
<P>"Some kind of a far-off relation of my mother's," replied Lady Euphra&s;ia, "who that old dowager, Lady Grey&s;tock, pick'd up in the wilds of Ireland, and has ab&s;olutely forced her upon our notice; though I a&s;&s;ure you, from compa&s;&s;ion, we &s;hould have taken the poor creature long ago under our protection, but for the &s;hocking conduct of her family to the Marchione&s;s, and the &s;ymptoms &s;he has already betrayed of following their example: it is really ridiculous &s;ending her to London&mdash;I dare &s;ay her &s;illy old father has exhau&s;ted all his ways and means in trying to render her decent, com|forting him&s;elf, no doubt, with the hope of her entrap|ping &s;ome young fool of quality, who may &s;upply his wants as well as her's."</P>

"I declare," conti|nued he, &s;urveying Amanda through an opera gla&s;s which dangled from his button hole, "if her father has nothing to &s;upport him, but the hope of her making a conque&s;t of importance, he will be in a &s;ad way, for 'pon my &s;oul, I can &s;ee nothing the girl has to recom|mend her, except novelty, and that, you know, is a charm which will le&s;&s;en every day: all &s;he can po&s;&s;ibly expect is an e&s;tabli&s;hment for a few months with &s;ome ta&s;tele&s;s being, who may like the &s;implicity of her country look&mdash;"</P>
<P>"And more than &s;he merits," exclaimed Mi&s;s Mal|colm; "I have no patience with &s;uch creatures forcing them&s;elves into &s;ociety quite above them."</P>
<P>"I a&s;&s;ure you," &s;aid Lady Euphra&s;ia, you would be a&s;toni&s;hed at her vanity and conceit, if you knew her: &s;he con&s;iders her&s;elf a fir&s;t rate beauty, though po&s;i|tively any one may &s;ee &s;he is quite the rever&s;e, and pre|tends to the greate&s;t gentlene&s;s and &s;implicity; then &s;he has made &s;ome &s;trange kind of people, to be &s;ure they mu&s;t be, believe &s;he is accompli&s;hed; though I dare &s;ay, if &s;he can read tolerably, and &s;crawl out a decent letter, 'tis all &s;he can do."</P>
<P>"We will quiz her after dinner, about her accom|pli&s;hments," &s;aid Freelove, "and have a little &s;un with her."</P>
<P>"Aye, do," cried Mi&s;s Malcolm, "we will a&s;k her to play, and &s;ing," &s;aid her lady&s;hip; for I a&s;&s;ure you &s;he pretends to excel in both; though from her father's poverty, I am certain &s;he can know little of either: I &s;hall enjoy her confu&s;ion of all things, when her igno|rance i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> detected."</P>
<P>Whil&s;t this conver&s;ation was pa&s;&s;ing, Amanda, in conver&s;ing with Lady Araminta, experienced the pure&s;t
<PB N="73" REF="038416_0266_1011E3426E0616D8">
plea&s;ure. Her Lady&s;hip was the "&s;oftened image" of Lord Mortimer; her voice was modulated to the &s;ame harmony as his, and Amanda gazed and li&s;tened with rapture. On her confu&s;ion abating, her eye had wan|dered round the room, in que&s;t of his Lord&s;hip, but he was not in. At every &s;tir near the door, her heart flutter|ed at the idea of &s;eeing him; nor was this idea relin|qui&s;hed, till &s;ummoned to dinner. She fortunately pro|cured a &s;eat next Lady Araminta, which prevented her thinking the time &s;pent at dinner tedious. In the even|ing the rooms were crouded with company, but Lord Mortimer appeared not among the brilliant a&s;&s;embly; yet the pang of di&s;appointment, was &s;oftened to Aman|da by his ab&s;ence, intimating that he was not anxious for the &s;ociety of Lady Euphra&s;ia:&mdash;true, bu&s;ine&s;s, or a prior engagement, might have prevented his coming, but &s;he, as is natural, fixed on the idea mo&s;t flattering to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Lady Euphra&s;ia, in pur&s;uance of the plan laid again&s;t Amanda, led the way to the mu&s;ic-room, attended by a large party; as Freelove had intimated to &s;ome of the beaux and belles, her Lady&s;hip and he were going to quiz an ignorant Iri&s;h country girl. Lady Euphra&s;ia &s;at down to the harp&s;ichord, that &s;he might have a bet|ter pretext for a&s;king Amanda to play. Freelove &s;eated him&s;elf by the latter, and began a conver&s;ation, which he thought would effectually embarra&s;s her; but it had quite a contrary effect, rendering him &s;o extremely ridiculous, as to excite an univer&s;al laugh at his ex|pence.</P>
<P>Amanda &s;oon perceived his intention in addre&s;&s;ing her, and al&s;o, that Lady Euphra&s;ia and Mi&s;s Malcolm were privy to it, having caught the &s;ignificant looks which pa&s;&s;ed among them. Though tremblingly alive to every feeling of mode&s;ty, &s;he had too much &s;en&s;e, and real noblene&s;s of &s;oul, to allow the illiberal &s;allies of impertinence to dive&s;t her of compo&s;ure.</P>
<P>"Have you &s;een any of the curio&s;ities of London, my dear," exclaimed Freelove, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">olling back in his chair
<PB N="74" REF="038416_0267_1011E344F98B52C0">
and contemplating the lu&s;tre of his buckles, uncon&s;cious of the ridicule he excited.</P>
<P>"I think I have," &s;aid Amanda, &s;omewhat archly, and glancing at him, "quite an original in its kind." Her looks, as well as the empha&s;is on her words, excited another laugh at his expence, which threw him into a momentary confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>"I think," &s;aid he, as he recovered from it, "the Monument and the Tower would be prodigious fine &s;ights to you, and I make it a particular reque&s;t that I may be included in your party whenever you vi&s;it them; particularly the la&s;t place."</P>
<P>"And why," replied Amanda, "&s;hould I take the trouble of vi&s;iting wild bea&s;ts, when every day I may &s;ee animals equally &s;trange, and not half &s;o mi&s;chievous!"</P>
<P>Freelove, in&s;en&s;ible as he was, could not mi&s;take the meaning of Amanda's words, and he left her with a mortified air, being, to u&s;e his own phra&s;e, "complete|ly done up."</P>
<P>Lady Euphra&s;ia now ri&s;ing from the harp&s;ichord, reque&s;ted Amanda to take her place at it; &s;aying, with an ironical air, "her performance (which indeed was &s;hocking) would make her's appear to amazing ad|vantage."</P>
<P>Diffident of her own abilities, Amanda begged to be excu&s;ed; but when Mi&s;s Malcolm, with an earne&s;t|ne&s;s even oppre&s;&s;ive, joined her entreaties to Lady Euphra&s;ia's, &s;he could no longer refu&s;e.</P>
<P>"I &s;uppo&s;e," &s;aid her Lady&s;hip, following her to the in&s;trument, "th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e &s;ongs, pre&s;enting her &s;ome trifling ones," will an&s;wer you better than the Italian mu&s;ic before you."</P>
<P>Amanda made no reply, but turned over the leaves of the book to a le&s;&s;on much more difficult than that Lady Euphra&s;ia had played. Her touch at fir&s;t was tremu|lous and weak, but &s;he was too &s;u&s;ceptible of the powers of harmony, not &s;oon to be in&s;pired by it; and gradual|ly her &s;tile became &s;o ma&s;terly and elegant, as to excite univer&s;al admiration, except in the bo&s;oms of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e who had hoped to place her in a ludicrous &s;ituation; their in|vidious

&s;cheme, in&s;tead of depre&s;&s;ing, had only &s;erved to render excellence con&s;picuous, and that mortification they de&s;tined for another, fell upon them&s;elves. When the le&s;&s;on was concluded, &s;ome gentlemen who either were, or pretended to be, mu&s;ical connoi&s;&s;eurs, intreat|ed her to &s;ing. She cho&s;e a plaintive Italian air, and the exqui&s;ite ta&s;te and &s;weetne&s;s with which &s;he &s;ung, equally a&s;toni&s;hed and delighted: nor was admiration confined to the accompli&s;hments &s;he di&s;played; the &s;oft expre&s;&s;ion of her countenance, which &s;eemed according to the harmonious &s;ounds that i&s;&s;ued from her lips, was vied with plea&s;ure, and prai&s;ed with energy; and &s;he ro&s;e from the harp&s;ichord covered with blu&s;hes, from the applau&s;e which &s;tole around her. The gentlemen gathered round Lady Euphra&s;ia, to inquire who the beautiful &s;tranger was, and &s;he gave them pretty much the &s;ame account &s;he had already done to Mi&s;s Mal|colm.</P>
<P>The rage and di&s;appointment of that young lady, and her Lady&s;hip, could &s;carcely be concealed.</P>
<P>"I declare I never knew any thing &s;o mon&s;trou&s;ly ab&s;urd," exclaimed Lady Euphra&s;ia," as to let a girl in her &s;ituation learn &s;uch things, except indeed, it was to qualify her for a governe&s;s, or an opera &s;inger."</P>
<P>"Aye, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;aid Mi&s;s Malcolm, "we &s;hall &s;oon hear her quivering away at one of the theatres, for no per&s;on of fa&s;hion would really entru&s;t their children to &s;o confident a creature."</P>
<P>The fair object of their di&s;quietude gladly accompa|nied Lady Araminta into another room: &s;everal gentle|men followed, and crouded about her chair, offering that adulation which they were accu&s;tomed to find acceptable at the &s;hrine of beauty: to Amanda, however, it was irk&s;ome, not only from its ab&s;urd extravagance, but as it interrupted her conver&s;ation with Lady Araminta. The Marchione&s;s, however, who critically watched her mo|tions, &s;oon relieved her from the trouble &s;ome a&s;&s;iduities of the beaux, by placing them at card tables; not, in|deed, from any good-natured motive, but &s;he could not bear that Amanda &s;hould have &s;o much attention paid
<PB N="76" REF="038416_0269_1011E34AF6D6F890">
her, and flattered her&s;elf &s;he would be vexed by lo&s;|ing it.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of conver&s;ation, Lady Araminta menti|oned Ireland. "She had a faint remembrance of ca&s;tle Carberry," &s;he &s;aid, "and had been half tempted to ac|company the Marquis and his family, in their late excur|&s;ion: her brother," &s;he added, "had almo&s;t made her promi&s;e to vi&s;it the ca&s;tle with him the en&s;uing &s;um|mer.&mdash;You have &s;een Lord Mortimer to be &s;ure," con|tinued her lady&s;hip.</P>
<P>"Yes, madam," faultered Amanda, while her face was over&s;pread with crim&s;on hue. Her lady&s;hip was too penetrating, not to perceive her confu&s;ion, and it gave ri&s;e to a conjecture of &s;omething more than a &s;light acquaintance being between his lord&s;hip and Amanda. The melancholy he had betrayed on his return from Ire|land, had excited the raillery of her lady&s;hip, till convinc|ed, by the di&s;compo&s;ure he &s;hewed, whenever &s;he attempt|ed to inquire into the occa&s;ion of it, that it proceeded from a &s;ource truly intere&s;ting to his feelings. She knew of the alliance her father had projected for him with the Ro&s;line family, a project &s;he never approved of, for lady Euphra&s;ia was truly di&s;agreeable to her; and a &s;oul like Mortimer's, tender liberal and &s;incere, &s;he knew could never experience the &s;malle&s;t degree of happine&s;s with a being &s;o uncongenial in every re&s;pect as was lady Euphra&s;ia to him. She loved her brother with the true&s;t tenderne&s;s, and &s;ecretly believed he was attached in Ireland. She wi&s;hed to gain his confidence, yet would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ot &s;olicit it, becau&s;e &s;he knew &s;he had it not in her power e&s;&s;entially to &s;erve him her arguments, &s;he was convinced, would have little weight with Lord Cherbu|ry, who had often expre&s;&s;ed to her his anxiety for a con|nection with the Ro&s;line family. With the loveline&s;s of Amanda's per&s;on, with the elegance of her manner, &s;he was immediately charmed, as &s;he conver&s;ed with her, e&s;teem was added to admiration, and &s;he believed that Mortimer would not have omitted mentioning to her the beautiful daughter of his father's agent, had he not &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ared betraying too much emotion at her name.
<PB N="77" REF="038416_0270_1011E34D71013E08">
She appeared to Lady Araminta ju&s;t the kind of woman he would adore, ju&s;t the being that would an&s;wer all the ideas of perfection (romantic ideas &s;he had called them) which he had declared nece&s;&s;ary to captivate his heart. Lady Araminta already felt for her un&s;peak|able tenderne&s;s; in the &s;oftne&s;s of her looks, in the &s;weetne&s;s of her voice there were re&s;i&s;tle&s;s charms; and &s;he felt, that if oppre&s;&s;ed by &s;orrow, Amanda Fitzalan, above all other beings, was the one &s;he would &s;elect to give her con&s;olation. The confu&s;ion &s;he betrayed at the mention of Mortimer, made her Lady&s;hip &s;u&s;|pect &s;he was the cau&s;e of his dejection. She involun|tarily fa&s;tened her eyes upon her face, as if to pene|trate the rece&s;&s;es of her heart, yet with a tenderne&s;s which &s;eemed to &s;ay, &s;he would pity the &s;ecret &s;he might there di&s;cover.</P>
<P>Lord Cherbury, at this moment of embarra&s;&s;ment to Amanda, approached, he &s;aid "He had ju&s;t been making a reque&s;t, and an apology to Lady Grey&s;tock, and was now come to repeat them to her; the former was, to meet the Marquis's family at his hou&s;e the next day at dinner, and the latter was, to excu&s;e &s;o uncere|monious an invitation, which he had been induced to make on Lady Araminta's account, who was obliged to leave town the day after the next, and had there|fore no time for the u&s;ual etiquette of vi&s;iting."</P>
<P>Amanda bowed. This invitation was more plea&s;ing than one of more form would have been; it &s;eemed to indicate friend&s;hip, and a de&s;ire to have the intimacy between her and his daughter cultivated; it gave her al&s;o a hope of &s;eeing Lord Mortimer. All the&s;e &s;ug|ge&s;tions in&s;pired her with uncommon animation, and &s;he entered into a lively conver&s;ation with Lord Cher|bury, who had infinite vivacity in his look and manner. Lady Araminta ob&s;erved the attention he paid her with plea&s;ure; a prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in her favour, &s;he tru&s;ted, might produce plea&s;ing con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Lady Grey&s;tock, at length, ro&s;e to depart&mdash;Amanda received an affectionate adieu from Lady Araminta; and Lord Cherbury attended the ladies to their carriage.
<PB N="78" REF="038416_0271_1011E34F03A48690">
On driving off, Lady Grey&s;tock ob&s;erved, what a charming polite man his lord&s;hip was; and, in &s;hort, threw out &s;uch hints, and entered into &s;uch a warm eu|logium on his merits, that Amanda began to think he would not find it very difficult <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o prevail on her Lady|&s;hip to enter once more the temple of Hymen.</P>
<P>Amanda retired to her chamber in a &s;tate of greater happine&s;s, than for a long perio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> before &s;he had expe|rienced; but it was a happine&s;s which rather agitated, than &s;oothed the feelings particularly her's, which were &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible of every impre&s;&s;ion, chat
<Q><L>They turned at the touch of joy or woe,</L>
<L>And turning trembled too.</L></Q></P>
<P>Her pre&s;ent happine&s;s was the offspring of hope and therefore peculiarly liable to di&s;appointment; a hope derived from the attentions of Lord Cherbury, and the tenderne&s;s of Lady Araminta, that the fond wi&s;hes of her heart might yet be realized: wi&s;hes, again believed, from hearing of Lord Mortimer's dejection&punc; (which his &s;i&s;ter had touched upon) from his ab&s;enting him&s;elf from the Marquis's, were not uncongenial to tho&s;e he him&s;elf entertained. She &s;at down to acquaint her fa|ther with the particulars of the day &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed, for her chief con&s;olation in her ab&s;ence from him, was, in the idea of writing and hearing con&s;tantly; her writing fini&s;hed, &s;he &s;at by the fire, meditating on the inter|view &s;he expected would take place on the en&s;uing day, till the hoar&s;e voice of the watchmen, proclaiming pa&s;t three o'clock' rou&s;ed her from the reverie; &s;he &s;miled at the ab&s;traction of her thoughts, and retired to bed to dream of felicity.</P>
<P>So calm were her &s;lumbers&mdash;&s;o delightful her dreams, that So! had long &s;hot his timorous ray into her chamber ere &s;he awoke. Her &s;pirits &s;till continued &s;erene and animated. On de&s;cending to the drawing-room, &s;he found Lady Grey&s;tock ju&s;t entering it. After breakfa&s;t, they went out in her lady&s;hip's carriage to different parts of the town. All was new to Amanda, who, during her former re&s;idence in it, had been entirely confined to
<PB N="79" REF="038416_0272_1011E350D0EDCD20">
lodgings in a retired &s;treet. She wondered at, and was amu&s;ed by the crowds continually pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing. About four they returned to dre&s;s. Amanda began the labours of the toilet with a beating heart; nor were its quick pul&s;ations decrea&s;ed on entering lady Grey&s;tock's carriage, which in a few minutes conveyed her to lord Cherbury's hou&s;e in St. James's Square. She followed her lady&s;hip with tottering &s;teps; and the fir&s;t object &s;he &s;aw on entering the drawing-room, was Mortimer &s;tanding near the door.</P>

<P>IN the drawing-room were already a&s;&s;em|bled, the Marquis, Marchione&s;s, Lady Euphra&s;ia, Mi&s;s Malcolm, and Freelove. Lady Araminta perceived, in the he&s;itating voice of Amanda, the emotions which agi|tated her, and which were not dimini&s;hed, when Lord Cherbury taking her trembling hand, &s;aid,</P>
<P>"Mortimer, I pre&s;ume you have already &s;een Mi&s;s Fitzalan in Ireland."</P>
<P>"I have my Lord," cried Mortimer, bowing, and at the &s;ame time approaching to pay his compliments.</P>
<P>Every eye in the room, except Lord Cherbury's and Freelove's, was now turned upon his Lord&s;hip and A|manda, and though, in the expre&s;&s;ive countenances of both, enough could be read to confirm their &s;u&s;picions of a mutual attachment &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between them.</P>
<P>Amanda, when &s;eated, endeavoured to recover from her confu&s;ion. Mi&s;s Malcolm, to prevent Lord Mor|timer's taking a &s;eat by her, which &s;he thought &s;he per|ceived him inclined to do, beckoned him to her, and contrived to engage him in trifling chat&punc; till they were

&s;ummoned to dinner. On receiving his hand, which he could not avoid offering, to lead her to the parlour, &s;he ca&s;t a look of exultation at Amanda. Lady Araminta perceiving all the gentlemen engaged, good humouredly put her arm within Amanda's, and &s;aid, &s;he would be her chaperon on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. Lord Mortimer quitted Mi&s;s Malcolm the moment he had procured her a &s;eat, though &s;he de&s;ired him to take one between her and Lady Euphra&s;ia, and pa&s;&s;ing to the other &s;ide, placed him&s;elf by Amanda. This action plea&s;ed her as much as it mortified them; it embarra&s;&s;ed her, however, a little; but perceiving the &s;crutinizing earne&s;tne&s;s with which the Marchione&s;s and Lady Euphra&s;ia regarded her, &s;he exerted her &s;pirits, and was &s;oon able to join in the ge|neral conver&s;ation, which Lord Mortimer promoted.</P>
<P>The unexpected arrival of Amanda in London, a&s;to|ni&s;hed, and notwith&s;tanding his re&s;entment delighted him. His &s;i&s;ter, when they were alone in the morning, had mentioned her with all the fervency of prai&s;e; her plaudits gave him a &s;en&s;ation of &s;atisfied pride, which convinced him he was not le&s;s than ever intere&s;ted about Amanda. Since his return from Ireland, he had been di&s;tracted by incertitude and anxiety about her; the in|nocence, the purity, the tenderne&s;s &s;he had di&s;played, were perpetually recurring to his memory; it was impo&s;&s;ible, he thought, they could be feigned, and he began to think the apparent my&s;tery of her conduct &s;he could &s;a|tisfactorily have explained: that de&s;ignedly &s;he had not avoided him; and that but for the impetuo&s;ity of his own pa&s;&s;ions, which had induced his precipitate depar|ture, he might ere this, have had all his doubts remov|ed. Tortured with ince&s;&s;ant regret for this departure, he would have returned immediately to Ireland, but at this period found it impo&s;&s;ible to do &s;o, without exciting inquiries from lord Cherbury, which at pre&s;ent he did not chu&s;e to an&s;wer. He had planned an excur&s;ion thither the en&s;uing &s;ummer, with lady <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, determined no longer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> endure his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> almo&s;t believ|ed it the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> interpo&s;ition of Providence which had brought Amanda to town, thus affording him another

opportunity of having his anxiety relieved, and the chief ob&s;tacle, perhaps to his, and he flattered him&s;elf, al&s;o to her happine&s;s, removed: for if a&s;&s;ured her preci|pitate journey from Wales was occa&s;ioned by no motive &s;he need blu&s;h to avow, he felt he &s;hould be better ena|bled to combat the difficulties he was convinced his fa|ther would throw in the way of their union. Notwith|&s;tanding lady Araminta's endeavours to gain his implicit confidence, he re&s;olved to withhold it from her, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould incur even the temporary di&s;plea&s;ure of lord Cherbury, by the warm intere&s;t he knew &s;he would take in his affairs, if once informed of them.</P>
<P>Amanda looked thinner and paler than when he had &s;een her in Ireland, yet, if po&s;&s;ible, more intere&s;ting from the&s;e circum&s;tances; and, from the &s;oft glance &s;he had involuntarily directed toward him at her en|trance, he was tempted to think he had in &s;ome degree, contributed to rob her lovely cheek of its bloom; and this idea rendered her dearer than ever to him. Scarce|ly could he re&s;train the rapture he felt on &s;eeing her within the nece&s;&s;ary bounds: &s;carcely could he believe the &s;cene, which had given ri&s;e to his happine&s;s, real; his heart, at the moment, melting with tenderne&s;s, &s;igh|ed for the period of explanation, which, he tru&s;ted, which he hoped, would al&s;o be the period of reconcilia|tion.</P>
<P>The gentlemen joined the ladies about tea time, and as no additional company was expected, Lady Euphra&s;ia propo&s;ed a party to the Pantheon; this was immediately agreed to. Amanda was delighted at the propo&s;al, as it not only promi&s;ed to gratify her curio&s;ity, but to give Lord Mortimer an opportunity of addre&s;&s;ing her, as &s;he &s;aw he wi&s;hed: but vainly attempted at home. The Marquis and Lord Cherbury declined going. Lady Grey&s;tock, who had not ordered her carriage till a much later hour, accepted a place in the Marchione&s;s'</P>
<P>Neither Lady Euphra&s;ia, nor Mi&s;s Malcolm, could bear the idea of Lord Mortimer and Amanda going in the &s;ame carriage, as the pre&s;ence of Lady Araminta,
<PB N="82" REF="038416_0275_1011E358E98856E8">
they were convinced, would not prevent their u&s;ing an opportunity, &s;o propitious for conver&s;ing, as they wi&s;hed. Lady Euphra&s;ia, therefore, with &s;udden eagerne&s;s, de|clared, &s;he and Mi&s;s Malcolm would re&s;ign their &s;eats in the marchione&s;s' carriage, to Mi&s;s Fitzalan and Freelove, for the plea&s;ure of accompanying Lady Ara|minta in her's. The Marchione&s;s, who conjectured her daughter's motive for this new arrangement, &s;econded it to the &s;ecret regret of Amanda, and the vi&s;ible chagrin of Lord Mortimer. Amanda, however, con&s;oled her&s;elf for this di&s;appointment, by reflecting on the plea&s;ure &s;he &s;hould enjoy in a few minutes, when freed from the di&s;agreeable ob&s;ervation of the Marchione&s;s and Lady Euphra&s;ia; her reflections were not in the lea&s;t inter|rupted by any conver&s;ation being addre&s;&s;ed to her. The Marchione&s;s and Lady Grey&s;tock chatted together, and Freelove amu&s;ed him&s;elf humming a &s;ong, as if for the purpo&s;e of mortifying Amanda by his inattention. When the carriage &s;topt, he a&s;&s;i&s;ted the former ladies out; but as if forgetting &s;uch a being exi&s;ted as Amanda, he went with them. She was de&s;cending the &s;teps, when Lord Mortimer pre&s;t forward, and &s;natching her hand, &s;oftly exclaimed, "We have met again, and neither envy nor malice &s;hall again &s;eparate us." A beautiful glow over&s;pread the countenance of Amanda; her hand trembled in his, and &s;he felt in that moment, recom|pen&s;ed for her former di&s;appointment, and elevated above the little in&s;olence of Freelove. Lord Mortimer handed her to his &s;i&s;ter, who was waiting to receive her, and they proceeded to the room. Lady Euphra&s;ia en|tered it with a temper unfitted for enjoyment: &s;he was convinced the whole &s;oul of Mortimer was devoted to Amanda, and &s;he trembled, from the violent and ma|lignant feelings that conviction excited. From the mo|ment he entered the carriage, till he quitted it, he had remained &s;ilent, notwith&s;tanding all her efforts, and Mi&s;s Malcolm's, to force him into conver&s;ation. He left them as &s;oon as they reached the Pantheon, to watch the Marchione&s;s' carriage, which followed their's, and on rejoining Amanda, he attached him&s;elf entirely to
<PB N="83" REF="038416_0276_1011E35BC8752558">
her, without any longer appearing anxious to conceal his predilection for her. He had, indeed, forgotten the nece&s;&s;ity there was for concealing it; all his feelings, all his ideas were engro&s;&s;ed by ec&s;tacy and tenderne&s;s. The novelty, the brilliancy of the &s;cene, excited &s;urpri&s;e and plea&s;ure in Amanda, and he was delighted with the ani|mated de&s;cription &s;he gave of the effect it produced up|on her mind. In her he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound united, exalted &s;en&s;e, lively fancy, and an uncorrupted ta&s;te: he forgot that the eyes of jealou&s;y and malevolence were on them: he forgot every object but her&s;elf.</P>
<P>But alas! poor Amanda was deemed to di&s;appoint|ment this evening. Lady Grey&s;tock, according to a hint &s;he had received, after a few rounds, &s;tept up to her, and declared &s;he mu&s;t accompany her to a &s;eat, as &s;he was convinced her health was yet too weak to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> much fatigue. Amanda <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> her me was not in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> lea&s;t fatigued, and that &s;he would prefer walking; be|&s;ides, &s;he had half promi&s;ed Lord Mortimer to dance with him. This, Lady Grey&s;tock ab&s;olutely declared, &s;he would no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> con&s;ent to, though Lady Araminta, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> who&s;e arm Amanda leaned, pleaded for her friend, a&s;|&s;uring her Lady&s;hip, "&s;he would take care Mi&s;s Fitz|alan &s;hould not injure her&s;elf."</P>
<P>"Ah, you young people," &s;aid Lady Grey&s;tock, "are &s;o carried away with &s;pirits, you never reflection con&s;equences; but I declare, as &s;he is entru&s;ted to my care, I could not an&s;wer it to my con&s;cience to let her run into any kind of danger."</P>
<P>Lady Araminta remon&s;trated with her Lady&s;hip, and Amanda would have joined, but that &s;he feared her real motive for &s;o doing would have been di&s;covered. She perceived the party were detained from proceeding on her account, and immediately offered her arm to Lady Grey&s;tock, and accompanied her and the Marchione&s;s to a &s;eat. Lady Euphra&s;ia, catching hold of Lady A|raminta's arm, hurried her, at the &s;ame in&s;tant, into the crowd; Mi&s;s Malcolm, as if by chance, laid her hand on Lord Mortimer, and thus compelled him to attend her party. She &s;aw him, however, in the cour&s;e
<PB N="84" REF="038416_0277_1011E35F112B2C10">
of the round, prepared to fly off; but when they had completed it, to her inexpre&s;&s;ible joy, the &s;ituation of Amanda made him relinqui&s;h his intention, as to con|ver&s;e with her was utterly impo&s;&s;ible, for the Marchio|ne&s;s had placed her between Lady Grey&s;tock and her|&s;elf; and under the pretence of frequently addre&s;&s;ing her Lady&s;hip, was continually leaning acro&s;s Amanda, &s;o as to exclude her almo&s;t from ob&s;ervation, thus ren|dering her &s;ituation, exclu&s;ive of regret at being &s;epa|rated from Lord Mortimer and Lady Araminta, high|ly di&s;agreeable. The Marchione&s;s enjoyed a malicious joy in the unea&s;ine&s;s &s;he &s;aw &s;he gave Amanda; &s;he deemed it but a &s;light retaliation for the unea&s;ine&s;s &s;he had given Lady Euphra&s;ia; a trifling puni&s;hment for the admiration &s;he had excited.</P>
<P>Amanda, indeed, whil&s;t &s;urveying the &s;cene around her with wonder and delight, had her&s;elf been an ob|ject of critical attention and enquiry; &s;he was followed, univer&s;ally admired, and allowed to be the fine&s;t girl that had appeared for a long &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>Relieved by her pre&s;ence, Lady Euphra&s;ia's &s;pirits began to revive, and her good humour to return. She laughed maliciou&s;ly with Mi&s;s Malcolm, at the di&s;ap|pointment of Lord Mortimer and Amanda. After a few rounds, Sir Charles Bingley, in company with ano|ther gentleman, pa&s;t them: he was, to u&s;e Mi&s;s Mal|colm's own phra&s;e, "an immen&s;e favourite with her," and &s;he had long meditated, and attempted the con|que&s;t of his heart. The attention which politene&s;s obli|ged him to &s;hew, and the compliments &s;he &s;ometimes compelled him to pay, &s;he flattered her&s;elf, were inti|mations of the &s;ucee&s;s of her &s;cheme. Lady Euphra&s;ia, notwith&s;tanding her intentions relative to Lord Morti|mer, and her profe&s;t friend&s;hip for Mi&s;s Malcolm, felt an ardent de&s;ire to have Sir Charles emolled in the li&s;t of her admirers; and both ladies determined he &s;hould not again pa&s;s, without noticing them. They accord|ing watched his approach, and when they again met, addre&s;t him in a manner, that to a man at all inter|e&s;ted about either, would have been truly flattering.
<PB N="85" REF="038416_0278_1011E360C6791AC0">
As this, however, was not the young Baronet's ca&s;e, after paying his compliments in a general way, to the whole party, he was making his parting bow, when his companion, pulling him by the &s;leeve, bid him ob&s;erve a beautiful girl &s;itting oppo&s;ite to them. They had &s;topt near the Marchione&s;s's &s;eat, and it was to Amanda Sir Charles's eyes were directed.</P>
<P>"Gracious heaven," cried he, &s;tarting; while his cheek was &s;uffu&s;ed with a glow of plea&s;ure, "Can this be po&s;&s;ible? Can this, in reality," advancing to her &s;eat, "be Mi&s;s Fitzalan? this &s;urely," continued he, "is a meeting as fortunate as unexpected; but for it, I &s;hould have been po&s;ting back to Ireland in a day or two."</P>
<P>Amanda blu&s;hed deeply, at his thus publicly declaring her power of regulating his actions. Her confu&s;ion re&s;tored that recollection his joyful &s;urpri&s;e had deprived him of, and he addre&s;t the Marchione&s;s and lady Grey|&s;tock. The former haughtily bowed, without &s;peaking; and the latter laughing &s;ignificantly, &s;aid, "&s;he really imagined ec&s;tacy on Mi&s;s Fitzalan's account, had made him forget any one el&s;e was pre&s;ent." The &s;ituation of Amanda was tantalizing in an extreme degree to Sir Charles: it precluded all conver&s;ation, and frequently hid her from his view, as the Marchione&s;s and lady Grey&s;tock &s;till continued their pretended whi&s;pers. Sir Charles had &s;ome knowledge of the Marchione&s;s's di&s;po&s;ition, and quickly perceived the motive of her pre|&s;ent conduct.</P>
<P>"Your lady&s;hip is kind," &s;aid he, "in trying to hide Mi&s;s Fitzalan, as no doubt you are con&s;cious 'tis not a &s;light heart-ache &s;he would give to &s;ome of the bells pre&s;ent this evening: but why," continued he, turn|ing to Amanda "do you prefer &s;itting to walking?"</P>
<P>Amanda made no an&s;wer; but a glance from her expre&s;&s;ive eyes to the ladies, informed him of the rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Lady Euphra&s;ia and Mi&s;s Malcolm, provoked at the abrupt departure of Sir Charles, had hurried on; but &s;carcely had they proceeded a few yards, 'ere envy and
<PB N="86" REF="038416_0279_1011E3632DEB2850">
curio&s;ity induced them to turn back. Lady Araminta perceived their chagrin, and &s;ecretly enjoyed it. Sir Charles, who had been looking impatiently for their approach, the moment he perceived them, entreated Amanda to join them.</P>
<P>"Let me" cried he, pre&s;enting his hand, "be your knight on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, and deliver you from what may be called ab&s;olute captivity."</P>
<P>She he&s;itated not to accept his offer; the continual buz in the room, with the pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing of the company had made her head giddy; &s;he deemed no apo|logy requi&s;ite to her companions, and quitting her &s;eat, ha&s;tened forward to Lady Araminta, who had &s;topt for her. A crowd at that moment intervening between them retarded her progre&s;s. Sir Charles pre&s;&s;ing her hand with fervour availed him&s;elf of this opportunity to expre&s;s his plea&s;ure at their unexpected meeting.</P>
<P>"Ah! how little," cried he, "did I imagine there was &s;uch happine&s;s in &s;tore for me this evening."</P>
<P>"Sir Charles," &s;aid Amanda, endeavouring, though in vain, to withdraw her hand, "you have learned the art of flattering &s;ince your return to England."</P>
<P>"I wi&s;h," cried he, "I had learned the art of ex|pre&s;&s;ing as I wi&s;h the &s;entiments I feel."</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer, who had made way through the crowd for the ladies, at this in&s;tant appeared; he &s;eemed to recoil at the &s;ituation of Amanda, who&s;e hand was yet detained in Sir Charles's, while the &s;oft glow and confu&s;ion of her face gave at lea&s;t a &s;u&s;picion of the language &s;he was li&s;tening to.</P>
<P>On rejoining the party, &s;he hoped again to have been joined by Lord Mortimer; but even if inclined to this, Sir Charles totally prevented him. His Lord&s;hip de&s;ert|ed them, yet almo&s;t continually contrived to intercept the party, and his eyes were always turned on Amanda and Sir Charles; he was really di&s;plea&s;ed with her; he thought &s;he might as well have left her &s;eat before, as after Sir Charles's appearance, and he re&s;olved to watch her clo&s;ely. She was a&s;ked to dance by Sir Charles, and &s;everal other gentlemen, but refu&s;ed, and Lady Ara|minta,
<PB N="87" REF="038416_0280_1011E364C5C2EA20">
on her account, followed her example. Lady Euphra&s;ia, and Mi&s;s Malcolm either were too much di&s;|compo&s;ed, or not a&s;ked by gentlemen they liked, to join the fe&s;tive group.</P>
<P>Amanda, from being di&s;appointed, &s;oon grew languid, and endeavoured to check, with more than u&s;ual &s;eriou&s;|ne&s;s, the ardent expre&s;&s;ions of Sir Charles, who repeat|edly declared, "he had hurried over the affairs which brought him to England, entirely on her account, as he thought every day an age till they again met."</P>
<P>She was rejoiced when Lady Araminta propo&s;ed re|turning home. Lady Euphra&s;ia and Mi&s;s Malcolm had no longer a de&s;ire to accompany her Lady&s;hip, as they believed Lord Mortimer already gone, and &s;he and A|manda, therefore returned alone. Sir Charles was in|vited to &s;upper, an invitation he joyfully accepted, and promi&s;ed to follow her Lady&s;hip as &s;oon as he had ap|pri&s;ed the party he came with of his intention.</P>
<P>Lady Araminta and Amanda arrived &s;ome time be|fore the re&s;t of the party; her Lady&s;hip &s;aid, "that her leaving town was to attend the nuptials of a particular friend," and was expre&s;&s;ing her hopes, that on her re|turn, &s;he &s;hould often be favoured with the company of Amanda, when the door &s;uddenly opened and Lord Mortimer entered. He looked plea&s;ed and &s;urpri&s;ed, and taking a &s;eat on the &s;opha between them, exclaim|ed, as he regarded them with unutterable tenderne&s;s, "Surely, one moment like this is worth whole hours, &s;uch as we have lately &s;pent. May I," looking at A|manda, "&s;ay, that chance is now as propitious to me, as it was &s;ome time ago to Sir Charles Bingley? Tell me," continued he, "were you not agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed to-night?"</P>
<P>"By the Pantheon? undoubtedly, my Lord."</P>
<P>"And by Sir Charles Bingley?"</P>
<P>"No: he is too <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">light an acquaintance, either to give plea&s;ure by his pre&s;ence, or pain by his ab&s;ence."</P>
<P>This was ju&s;t what Lord Mortimer wanted to hear. The looks of Amanda, and above all, the manner in which &s;he had received the attentions of Sir Charles,
<PB N="88" REF="038416_0281_1011E3676AEA09C8">
evinced her &s;incerity. The &s;hadow of jealou&s;y remov|ed, Lord Mortimer recovered all his animation. Never does the mind feel &s;o light, &s;o truly happy, as when a painful doubt is bani&s;hed from it.</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Fitzalan," &s;aid Lady Araminta, recurring to what Amanda had ju&s;t &s;aid, "can &s;ee few beings like her&s;elf, capable of exciting immediate e&s;teem; for my part, I cannot per&s;uade my&s;elf that &s;he is an acquaint|ance of but two days, I feel &s;uch an intere&s;t in her wel|fare, &s;uch a &s;i&s;terly regard."&mdash;She pau&s;ed, and looked expre&s;&s;ively on her brother and Amanda. His fine eyes beamed the livelie&s;t plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>"Oh my &s;i&s;ter," cried he, "encourage that &s;i&s;terly affection: Who &s;o worthy of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it as Mi&s;s Fitz|alan? and who but Amanda," continued he, pa&s;&s;ing his arm round her wai&s;t, and &s;oftly whi&s;pering to her, "&s;hall have a right to claim it?"</P>
<P>The &s;topping of the carriages now announced the re|turn of the party, and terminated a &s;cene which, if much longer protracted, might, by increa&s;ing their agitation, have produced a full di&s;covery of their feelings. The ladies were attended by Sir Charles and Freelove. The Marquis and Lord Cherbury had been out, but returned about this time, and &s;oon after &s;upper the company departed, Lady Araminta tenderly bidding Amanda farewell.</P>
<P>The cares which had &s;o long pre&s;t upon the heart of Amanda, and di&s;turbed its peace, were now vani&s;hed; the whi&s;per of Lord Mortimer had a&s;&s;ured her, that &s;he was not only the object of his tendere&s;t affection, but mo&s;t &s;erious attention; the regard of Lady Araminta flattered her pride, as it implied a tacit approbation of her brother's choice.</P>
<P>The next morning, immediately after breakfa&s;t, La|dy Grey&s;tock went cut to her lawyer, and Amanda was &s;itting at work in the dre&s;&s;ing-room, when Sir Charles Bingley was announced. He now expre&s;&s;ed, if po&s;&s;i|ble, more plea&s;ure, at &s;eeing her, than he had done the preceding night; congratulated him&s;elf at finding her alone, and repeatedly declared, from their fir&s;t interview
<PB N="89" REF="038416_0282_1011E36BA6735E58">
her image had never been ab&s;ent from his mind.&mdash;The particularity and ardour of his expre&s;&s;ions, Amanda wi&s;hed, and endeavoured to repre&s;s: &s;he had not the ri|diculous and unfeeling vanity to be delighted with an attachment &s;he could not return; be&s;ides, his attentions were unplea&s;ing, as &s;he believed they gave unea&s;ine&s;s to Lord Mortimer; &s;he therefore an&s;wered him with cold and &s;tudied caution, which, to his impetuous feelings, was in&s;upportable. Half re&s;enting, half rallying it, he &s;natched her hand, in &s;pite of her efforts to prevent him, and was declaring he could not bear it, when the door opened, and Lord Mortimer appeared. Had A|manda been encouraging the regard of Sir Charles, &s;he could not have betrayed more confu&s;ion. Lord Mor|timer retreated a few &s;teps, in evident embarra&s;&s;ment: then bowing coolly, again advanced and took a &s;eat. Sir Charles &s;tarted up, with a look which &s;eemed to &s;ay he had been mo&s;t unplea&s;antly interrupted, and walked about the room. Amanda was the fir&s;t who broke &s;i|lence; &s;he a&s;ked, in a he&s;itating voice, "Whether La|dy Araminta was yet gone?"</P>
<P>"No," his Lord&s;hip gravely replied, "but in a few minutes &s;he propo&s;ed &s;etting out, and he meant to ac|company her part of the way."</P>
<P>"So, till her Lady&s;hip was ready," cried Sir Charles, with quickne&s;s, "that no time might be lo&s;t, you came to Mi&s;s Fitzalan?"</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer made no reply; he frowned, and ri|&s;ing directly, &s;lightly &s;aluted Amanda and retired.</P>
<P>Convinced, as &s;he was, that Lord Mortimer had made the vi&s;it for the purpo&s;e of &s;peaking more explicitly than he had yet done, &s;he could not entirely conceal her chagrin, or regard Sir Charles without &s;ome di&s;plea&s;ure. It had not, however, the effect of making him &s;horten his vi&s;it; he continued with her till Lady Grey&s;tock's return, to whom he propo&s;ed a party that evening for the opera, and obtained permi&s;&s;ion to wait upon her Lady&s;hip at tea, with tickets, notwith&s;tanding Amanda declared her di&s;inclination to going:&mdash;&s;he wi&s;hed to avoid the public as well as private attentions of Sir
<PB N="90" REF="038416_0283_1011E36D33F58768">
Charles; but both &s;he found impo&s;&s;ible to do. The impre&s;&s;ion which the charms of her mind and form had made on him, was of too ardent too permanent a nature, to be era&s;ed by her coldne&s;s: generous and exalted in his notions; affluent and independent in his fortune, he neither required any addition of wealth, nor was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nder any controul, which could prevent his following his in|clinations:&mdash;his heart was bent on an union with Aman|da: though hurt by her indifference, he would not al|low him&s;elf to be di&s;couraged by it; time and per&s;eve|rance, he tru&s;ted and believed, would conquer it. Un|accu&s;tomed to di&s;appointment, he could not, in an af|fair which &s;o materially concerned his happine&s;s, bear the idea of proving un&s;ucce&s;sful. Had Amanda's heart been di&s;engage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, he would probably have &s;ucceeded as he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; for he was calculated to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, to in&s;pir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and e&s;teem; and Amanda felt a real friend|&s;hip <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> him, and &s;incerely grieved that his ardent re|gard could not be reduced to as temperate a medium as her's.</P>
<P>Lady Grey&s;tock had a numerous and brilliant ac|quaintance in London, among&s;t whom &s;he was continu|ally engaged. Sir Charles was well known to them, and therefore almo&s;t con&s;tantly attended Amanda where|ever &s;he went. His unremitted and particular attention excited univer&s;al ob&s;ervation, and he was publicly de|clared the profe&s;t admirer of Lady Grey&s;tock's beautiful companion. The appellation was generally be&s;towed on her by the gentlemen; as many of Lady Grey&s;tock's female intimates declared, from the appearance of the girl, as well as her di&s;tre&s;t &s;ituation, they wondered Sir Charles Bingley could ever think about her: for her La|dy&s;hip had repre&s;ented her as a per&s;on in the mo&s;t indi|gent circum&s;tances, on which account &s;he had taken her under her protection. All that envy, hatred and malice could &s;ugge&s;t again&s;t her, Mi&s;s Malcolm &s;aid. The Marchione&s;s and Lady Euphra&s;ia, judging of her by them&s;elves, &s;uppo&s;ed, that as &s;he was not &s;ure of Lord Mortimer, &s;he would accept of Sir Charles; and though this mea&s;ure would remove all apprehen&s;ions relative to
<PB N="91" REF="038416_0284_1011E36EF75B3FD8">
Lord Mortimer, yet the idea of the wealth and con&s;e|quence &s;he would derive from it, almo&s;t di&s;tracted them; thus does envy &s;ting the bo&s;oms which labour it.</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer again re&s;umed his re&s;erve: he was frequently in company with Amanda, but never even at|tempted to pay her any attention; yet his eyes, which &s;he often caught rivited on her, though the moment &s;he perceived them they were withdrawn, &s;eemed to &s;ay, that the alteration in his manner was not produced by any diminution of tenderne&s;s: he was indeed determi|ned to regulate his conduct by her's to Sir Charles: though pained and irritated by his a&s;&s;iduities, he had too much pride to declare a prior claim to her regard; a woman who could waver between two objects, be deem|ed unworthy of either. He therefore re&s;olved to leave Amanda free to act, and put her con&s;tancy to a kind of te&s;t: yet notwith&s;tanding all his pride, we believe, if not pretty well convinced that this te&s;t would have prov|ed a &s;ource of triumph to him&s;elf, he never would have &s;ubmitted to it. The period for Lady Araminta's re|turn was now arrived, and Amanda was anxiou&s;ly ex|pecting her, when &s;he heard from Lady Euphra&s;ia, that her Lady&s;hip had been ill in the country, and would not therefore leave it for &s;ome time. This was a &s;evere di&s;|appointment to Amanda, who had hoped, by her Lady|&s;hip's means, to have &s;een le&s;s of Sir Charles, and more of Lord Mortimer.</P>

<Q><L>And why &s;hould &s;uch, within her&s;elf, &s;he cried,</L>

<BIBL>PARNELL.</BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AMANDA was &s;itting alone in the drawing room one morning, when a gentleman was &s;hewn into it, to wait for Lady Grey&s;tock. The &s;tranger was about the middle period of life; his dre&s;s announced him a military man, and his threadbare coat &s;eemed to declare that whatever laurels he had gathered, they were barren ones. His form and face were intere&s;ting; infirmity appeared to pre&s;s upon one, and &s;orrow had deeply marked the other; yet without de&s;poiling it of a certain expre&s;&s;ion which indicated the hilarity nature had once &s;tampt upon it: his temples were &s;unk, and his cheek faded to a &s;ickly hue. Amanda felt immediate re&s;pect and &s;en&s;ibility for the intere&s;ting figure before her: the feelings of her &s;oul, the early le&s;&s;ons of her youth, had taught her to reverence di&s;tre&s;s; and never, perhaps, did &s;he think it &s;o peculiarly affecting, as when in a mi|litary garb.</P>
<P>The day was uncommonly &s;evere, and the &s;tranger &s;hivered with the cold.</P>
<P>"I declare, young lady," cried he, as he took the chair which Amanda had placed for him by the fire, "I think I &s;hould not tremble more before an enemy, than I do before this day: I don't know but what it is as e&s;|&s;ential for a &s;ubaltern officer to &s;tand cold as well as fire."</P>
<P>Amanda &s;miled, and re&s;umed her work:&mdash;&s;he was bu|&s;ily employed making a trimming of artificial flowers for Lady Grey&s;tock, to pre&s;ent to a young lady, from who&s;e family &s;he had received &s;ome obligations. This was a cheap mode of returning them, as Amanda's ma|terials were u&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="038416_0286_1011E37585B49DF8">
"Your employment is an entertaining one," &s;aid the &s;tranger, "and your ro&s;es literally without thorns; &s;uch, no doubt, as you expect to gather in your path through life."</P>
<P>"No," replied Amanda, "I have no &s;uch expect|ation."</P>
<P>"And yet," &s;aid he, "how few at your time of life, particularly if po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of your advantages, could make &s;uch a declaration."</P>
<P>"Whoever had reflection undoubtedly would," re|plied Amanda.</P>
<P>"That I allow," cried he, "but how few do we find with reflection?&mdash;from the young it is bani&s;hed as the rigid tyrant that would forbid the enjoyment of the plea&s;ures they pant after:&mdash;and from the old it is too often expelled as an enemy to that forgetfulne&s;s which can alone en&s;ure their tranquility.</P>
<P>"But in both, I tru&s;t," &s;aid Amanda, "you will allow there are exceptions."</P>
<P>"Perhaps there are, yet often, when con&s;cience has no rea&s;on to dread, &s;en&s;ibility has cau&s;e to fear reflec|tion; which not only revives the recollection of happy hours, but in&s;pire &s;uch a regret for their lo&s;s, as almo&s;t unfits the &s;oul for any exertions; 'tis indeed beautifully de&s;cribed in the&s;e lines&mdash;
<Q><L>Still importunate and vain,</L>
<L>To former joys recurring ever,</L>
<L>And turning all the pa&s;t to pain."</L></Q></P>
<P>Amanda attentively watched him, and thought what he &s;aid appeared particularly applicable to him&s;elf, as his countenance a&s;&s;umed a more dejected expre&s;&s;ion. He revived, however, in a few moments.</P>
<P>"I have, my dear young lady," continued he &s;mi|ling, "beguiled you mo&s;t &s;oberly," as lady Grace &s;ays, into conver&s;ation; I have, however, given you an op|portunity of amu&s;ing your fancy by drawing a compa|ri&s;on between an old veteran and a young &s;oldier: but though you may allow him more animation, I tru&s;t you
<PB N="94" REF="038416_0287_1011E3771413CD10">
will not do me &s;o much inju&s;tice, as to allow him more ta&s;te, while he merely extolled the lu&s;tre of your eyes, I &s;hould admire the mildne&s;s which tempered that lu&s;|tre: while he prai&s;ed the glow of your cheek. I &s;hould adore that &s;en&s;ibility which had power, in a moment to augment or dimini&s;h."</P>
<P>At this in&s;tant Lady Grey&s;tock entered the room:&mdash;&s;he entered it with the &s;well of importance, and a haugh|ty expre&s;&s;ion of contempt in her features:</P>
<P>The &s;tranger ro&s;e from his chair, and his palene&s;s encrea&s;ed.</P>
<P>"So, Mr. Ru&s;hbrook," at la&s;t drawled out her La|dy&s;hip&mdash;"So, Sir, but pray be &s;eated," waving her hand at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>Amanda now retired: &s;he had lingered a few mo|ments in the room, under the pretence of putting her work out of her Lady&s;hip's way, to di&s;cover who the &s;tranger was.</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook had been repre&s;ented to her as artful, trea|cherous, and contemptible. His appearance was almo&s;t a &s;ufficient refutation of tho&s;e charges, and &s;he began to think they never would have been laid again&s;t him by any other being than Lady Grey&s;tock, from a de&s;ire of depreciating her adver&s;ary. In her Lady&s;hip &s;he had &s;een much to di&s;like &s;ince &s;he re&s;ided with her; &s;he &s;aw that the temper, like the per&s;on, is often allowed to be in di&s;hable at home.</P>
<P>She felt even warmly intere&s;ted about Ru&s;hbrook; &s;he had heard of his large family; and from his appear|ance, &s;he conjectured, they mu&s;t be in di&s;tre&s;s. There was a kind of humorous &s;adne&s;s in his manner, which affected her even more than a &s;ettled melancholy perhaps would have done, as it implied the efforts of a noble heart to repel &s;orrow; and if there cannot be a more noble, neither &s;urely can there be a more affecting &s;ight, than that of a good and brave man &s;truggling with adver&s;ity.</P>
<P>As &s;he leaned pen&s;ively again&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he window, reflect|ing on the various inequalities of fortune: yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> they were de&s;igned by a wi&s;e providence; like <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and valley, mutually to benefit each other, &s;he &s;aw
<PB N="95" REF="038416_0288_1011E379D2AFE7B0">
Ru&s;hbrook cro&s;s the &s;treet; his walk was the &s;low and lingering walk of dejection and di&s;appointment: he rai&s;|ed his hand to his eyes; Amanda &s;uppo&s;ed to wipe away his tears, and her own fell at the &s;uppo&s;ition. The &s;e|verity of the day had increa&s;ed, a heavy &s;hower of &s;now was falling, again&s;t which poor Ru&s;hbrook had no &s;helter but his thread-bare coat. Amanda was unutterably affected; and when he di&s;appeared from her &s;ight, &s;he fell into a &s;entimental &s;oliloquy, &s;ome|thing in the &s;tile of Yorick.</P>
<P>"Was I mi&s;tre&s;s," exclaimed &s;he, as &s;he beheld the &s;plendid carriages pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing.&mdash;"Was I mi&s;|tre&s;s of one of the&s;e carriages, an old &s;oldier, like Ru&s;hbrook, &s;hould not be expo&s;ed to the inclemency of a wintry &s;ky; neither &s;hould his coat be thread-bare; or his heart oppre&s;t with angui&s;h: if I &s;aw a tear upon his cheek, I would &s;ay it had no bu&s;ine&s;s there, for com|fort was about revi&s;iting him."&mdash;As &s;he &s;poke, the idea of Lord Mortimer occurred: her tears was &s;u&s;|pended and her cheek began to glow.</P>
<P>"Yes, poor Ru&s;hbrook," &s;he exclaimed, "perhaps the period is not far di&s;tant, when a bounteous Provi|dence, through the hands of Amanda, may relieve thy wants; when Mortimer him&s;elf may be her a&s;&s;i&s;tant in the office of benevolence."</P>
<P>Lady Grey&s;tock's woman now appeared, to de&s;ire &s;he would come down to her lady. She immediately obeyed the &s;ummons, with a &s;ecret hope of hearing &s;omething of the conference. Her Lady&s;hip received her with an exulting laugh.</P>
<P>"I have good news to tell you, my dear," exclaimed &s;he," that poor w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">tch, Ru&s;hbrook, has lo&s;t the friend who was to have &s;upported him in the law-&s;uit; and the lawyers finding the &s;heet anchor gone, have &s;teered off, and left him to &s;hift for him&s;elf; the mi&s;erable creature and his family mu&s;t certainly &s;tarve: only think of his a&s;&s;urance: he came to &s;ay, indeed, he would now be &s;atisfied with a compromi&s;e."</P>
<P>"Well, madam," &s;aid Amanda.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="038416_0289_1011E37D16A27EA0">
"Well, madam," repeated her Lady&s;hip, mimicking her manner, "I told him I mu&s;t be a fool indeed, if I ever con&s;ented to &s;uch a thing, after his effrontery in attempting to litigate the will of his much abu&s;ed uncle, my dear good Sir Geoffry. No, no, I bid him proceed in the &s;uit, and all my lawyers were prepared; and after &s;o much trouble on both &s;ides, it would be a pity the thing came to nothing."</P>
<P>"As your Lady&s;hip, however, knows his extreme di&s;tre&s;s, no doubt you will relieve it."</P>
<P>"Why pray," &s;aid her Lady&s;hip, &s;martly, "do you think he has any claim upon me?"</P>
<P>"Yes," replied Amanda, "if not upon your ju&s;tice, at lea&s;t upon your humanity."</P>
<P>"So you would advi&s;e me to fling away my money upon him?</P>
<P>"Yes," replied Amanda &s;miling, "I would: and as your Lady&s;hip likes the expre&s;&s;ion, have you fling it away profu&s;ely."</P>
<P>"Well, well," an&s;wered &s;he, "when you arrive at my age, you will know the real value of wealth."</P>
<P>"I tru&s;t, madam," &s;aid Amanda with &s;pirit, "know its real value already: we only e&s;timate it differ|ently."</P>
<P>"And pray," a&s;ked her Lady&s;hip, with a &s;neer, "how may you e&s;timate it?"</P>
<P>"As the means, madam, of di&s;pen&s;ing happine&s;s around us;&mdash;of giving &s;helter to the "hou&s;ele&s;s child of want," and joy to the afflicted heart; as a &s;acred depo&s;it entru&s;t|ed to us by an Almighty Power for tho&s;e purpo&s;es: which, if &s;o applied, will nouri&s;h placid and delightful reflections, that like &s;oothing friends, will croud around us in the bed of &s;ickne&s;s or death, alleviating the pains of one, and the terrors of the other."</P>
<P>"Upon my word," exclaimed Lady Grey&s;tock," a fine flowery &s;peech, and well calculated for a &s;entimen|tal novel, or a moral treati&s;e for the improvement of youth; but I advi&s;e you, my dear, in future, to keep your queer and romantic notions to your&s;elf, or el&s;e it will be &s;u&s;pected you have made romances your &s;tudy,
<PB N="97" REF="038416_0290_1011E37F64007228">
for you have ju&s;t &s;poken as one of their heroines would have done."</P>
<P>Amanda made no reply; yet as &s;he beheld her Lady|&s;hip &s;eated in an ea&s;y chair, by a blazing fire, with a large bowl of rich &s;oup before her, which &s;he took eve|ry morning, &s;he could not forbear &s;ecretly exclaiming,&mdash;Hard hearted woman, engro&s;&s;ed by your own gratifi|cations, no ray of compa&s;&s;ion can &s;often your nature for the misfortunes of others: &s;heltered your&s;elf from the tempe&s;t, you &s;ee it falling, without pity, on the head of wretchedne&s;s; and while you fea&s;t on luxuries, think, without emotion, on tho&s;e who want even common ne|ce&s;&s;aries.</P>
<P>In the evening they went to a large party at the Mar|chione&s;s's, but though the &s;cene was gay and brilliant, it could not remove the pen&s;ivene&s;s of Amanda's &s;pirits: the emaciated form of Ru&s;hbrook, returning to his de&s;olate family, dwelt upon her mind. A little, &s;he thought, as &s;he &s;urveyed the magnificence of the apart|ments and the &s;plendour of the company which crouded them: a little from this parade of vanity and wealth, would give relief to many a child of indigence: never had the truth of the following lines &s;o forcibly &s;truck her imagination.</P>
<LG>
<L>Ah, little think the gay, licentious, proud,</L>
<L>Whom plea&s;ure, power, and affluence &s;urround,</L>
<L>They, who their thoughtle&s;s hours in giddy mirth.</L>
<L>And wanton, often cruel, riot wa&s;te:</L>
<L>Ah, little think they, while they dance along,</L>
<L>How many feel this very moment, death,</L>
<L>And all the &s;ad variety of Pain.</L>
<L>How many drink the cup</L>
<L>Of baleful grief, or eat the bitter bread</L>
<L>Of mi&s;ery, &s;ore pierc'd by wintry winds?</L>
<L>How many &s;hrink into the &s;ordid hut</L>
<L>Of cheerle&s;s poverty?</L>
</LG>
<P>From &s;uch reflections as the&s;e, &s;he was di&s;turbed by the entrance of Sir Charles Bingley. As u&s;ual he took
<PB N="98" REF="038416_0291_1011E380F1BD2F50">
his &s;tation by her, and in a few minutes after him Lord Mortimer appeared. A party for vingt'un was formed, in which Amanda joined, from a wi&s;h of avoiding the a&s;&s;iduities of Sir Charles; but he took care to &s;e|cure a &s;eat next her's, and Lord Mortimer &s;at oppo&s;ite to them.</P>
<P>"Bingley," &s;aid a gentleman, after they had been &s;ome time at the table, "you are certainly the mo&s;t changeable fellow in the world. About three weeks ago you were hurrying every thing for a journey to Ireland, as if life and death depended on your expe|dition; and here I &s;till find you, loitering about the town."</P>
<P>"I deny the imputation of changeablene&s;s," replied the Baronet, "all my actions are regulated, "and he glanced at Amanda, "by one &s;ource, one object."</P>
<P>Amanda blu&s;hed, and caught, at that moment, a pe|netrating look from Lord Mortimer.</P>
<P>Her &s;ituation was extremely di&s;agreeable: &s;he dread|ed his attentions would be imputed to encouragement from her: &s;he had often tried to &s;uppre&s;s them, and &s;he re&s;olved her next efforts &s;hould be more re&s;olute.</P>
<P>Sir Charles reached Pall Mall the next morning, ju&s;t as Lady Grey&s;tock was &s;tepping into her chariot, to ac|quaint her lawyer of Ru&s;hbrook's vi&s;it. She informed him that Mi&s;s Fitzalan was in the drawing room, and he flew up to her.</P>
<P>"You find," &s;aid he, "by what you heard la&s;t night, that my conduct has excited &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e; I a&s;&s;ure you my friends think I mu&s;t ab&s;olutely be deranged, to re|linqui&s;h &s;o &s;uddenly a journey I appeared &s;o anxious to take: &s;uffer me," continued he, taking her hand, "to a&s;&s;ign the true rea&s;on for this apparent change."</P>
<P>"Sir Charles," replied Amanda, "'tis time to ter|minate this trifling."</P>
<P>"Oh let it then be terminated," &s;aid he, with eager|ne&s;s," by your con&s;enting to my happine&s;s; by your accepting a hand, tendered to you with the mo&s;t ardent affections of my heart."</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="038416_0292_1011E38284650000">
With equal delicacy and tenderne&s;s, he then urged her acceptance of propo&s;als, which were as di&s;intere&s;ted as the mo&s;t romantic genero&s;ity could de&s;ire them to be.</P>
<P>Amanda felt really concerned that he had made them; the grateful &s;en&s;iblity of her nature, was hurt at the idea of giving him pain.</P>
<P>"Believe me, Sir Charles," &s;aid &s;he, "I am truly &s;en&s;ible of the honour of your addre&s;&s;es; but I &s;hould deem my&s;elf unworthy of the favourable opinion which excited them, if I delayed a moment a&s;&s;uring you, that friend&s;hip was the only return in my power to make for them."</P>
<P>The impetuous pa&s;&s;ions of Sir Charles were now all in commotion; he &s;tarted from his chair, and traver&s;ed the apartment in breathle&s;s agitation.</P>
<P>"I will not, Mi&s;s Fitzalan," &s;aid he, re&s;uming his &s;eat again, "believe you inflexible: I will not believe that you can think I &s;hall &s;o ea&s;ily re&s;ign an idea, which I have &s;o long cheri&s;hed with rapture."</P>
<P>"Surely, Sir Charles," &s;omewhat alarmed, "you cannot accu&s;e me of having encouraged that idea?"</P>
<P>"Oh no," &s;ighed he, pa&s;&s;ionately, "to me you were always uniformly cold."</P>
<P>"And from whence then proceeded &s;uch an idea?"</P>
<P>"From the natural propen&s;ity we all have to deceive our&s;elves and to believe, that whatever we wi&s;h will be accompli&s;hed. Ah! Mi&s;s Fitzalan, deprive me not of &s;o &s;weet a belief: I will not at pre&s;ent urge you to any material &s;tep to which you are aver&s;e; I will only en|treat for permi&s;&s;ion to hope, that time, per&s;everance, unremitted attention, may make &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion on you, and at la&s;t produce a change in my favour."</P>
<P>"Never, Sir Charles, will I give ri&s;e to a hope, which I think cannot be realized; a little reflection will convince you, you &s;hould not be di&s;plea&s;ed at my being &s;o explicit. We are, at this moment, both, perhaps, too much di&s;compo&s;ed to render a longer conference de&s;ira|ble: pardon me, therefore, if I now terminate it, and be a&s;&s;ured. I &s;hall never lo&s;e a grateful remembrance of
<PB N="100" REF="038416_0293_1011E3B4E97236D8">
the honour you intended me: or forget the friend&s;hip I profe&s;t for Sir Charles Bingley."</P>
<P>She then withdrew, without any ob&s;truction from him: regret and di&s;appointment &s;eemed to have &s;u&s;pend|ed his faculties; but it was a momentary &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, and on recovering them, he quitted the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>His pride, as fir&s;t, urged him to give up Amanda for ever; but his tenderne&s;s &s;oon &s;uppre&s;&s;ed this re&s;olution. He had, as he him&s;elf acknowledged, a propen&s;ity to believe, that whatever he wi&s;hed was ea&s;y to accom|pli&s;h: this propen&s;ity proceeded from the ea&s;ine&s;s with which his inclinations had hitherto been gratified: flat|tering him&s;elf, that the coldne&s;s of Amanda proceeded more from natural re&s;erve, than particular indifference to him: he &s;till hoped &s;he might be induced to favour him. She was &s;o &s;uperior, in his opinion, to every wo|man he had &s;een; &s;o truly calculated to render him hap|py, that as the violence of offended pride abated, he re|&s;olved, without another effort, not to give her up. Without knowing it, he had rambled to St. James&punc;s &s;quare, and having heard of the friend&s;hip &s;ub&s;i&s;ting be|tween Lord Cherbury and Fitzalan, he deemed his Lord|&s;hip a proper per&s;on to apply to on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion; thinking, that if he intere&s;ted him&s;elf in his favour, he might yet be &s;ucce&s;sful. He accordingly repaired to his hou&s;e, and was &s;hewn into an apartment where the Earl, and Lord Mortimer were &s;itting together. After pay|ing the u&s;ual compliments, "I am come, my Lord," &s;aid he, &s;omewhat abruptly, "to entreat your intere&s;t in an affair, which materially concerns my happine&s;s, and tru&s;t your Lord&s;hip will excu&s;e my entreaty, when I inform you, it relates to Mi&s;s Fitzalan."</P>
<P>The Earl, with much politene&s;s, a&s;&s;ured him, "he &s;hould feel happy in an opportunity of &s;erving him," and &s;aid, "he did him but ju&s;tice in &s;uppo&s;ing him particularly intere&s;ted about Mi&s;s Fitzalan, not only as the daughter of his old friend, but from her own great merit."</P>
<P>Sir Charles then acquainted him of the propo&s;als he had ju&s;t made her: and her ab&s;olute rejection of them;
<PB N="101" REF="038416_0294_1011E38700A05EB0">
expre&s;t his hope that Lord Cherbury would try to influ|ence her in his fovour.</P>
<P>"'Tis very extraordinary indeed," cried his Lord&s;hip, "that Mi&s;s Fitzalan &s;hould decline &s;uch an honour|able, &s;uch an advantageous propo&s;al: are you &s;ure Sir Charles, there is no prior attachment in the ca&s;e?"</P>
<P>"I never heard of one, my Lord, and I believe none exi&s;ts." Lord Mortimer's countenance loured at this, but happily its gloom was unperceived.</P>
<P>"I will write to day," &s;aid the Earl, "to Mr. Fitz|alan, and mention your propo&s;al to him in the terms it de&s;erves; except authorized by him, you mu&s;t, Sir Charles, excu&s;e my per&s;onal interference in the affair: I have no doubt, indeed, but he will approve of your ad|dre&s;&s;es, and you may then depend on my &s;econding them with all my intere&s;t."</P>
<P>This promi&s;e &s;atisfied Sir Charles, and he &s;oon after withdrew. Lord Mortimer was now pretty well con|vinced of the &s;tate of Amanda's heart: under this con|viction, he delayed not many minutes after Sir Charles's departure, going to Pall Mall; and having particularly inquired whether Lady Grey&s;tock was out, and being an&s;wered in the affirmative, he a&s;cended to the drawing room, to which Amanda had again returned.</P>

<P>IN an emotion of &s;urpri&s;e at &s;o unexpected a vi&s;it, the book &s;he was reading dropt from Amanda, and &s;he aro&s;e in vi&s;ible agitation.</P>
<P>"I fear," &s;aid his Lord&s;hip," I have intruded &s;ome|what abruptly upon you; but my apology for doing &s;o, mu&s;t be my ardent wi&s;h of u&s;ing an opportunity &s;o pro|pitious for a mutual ecclairci&s;&s;ement; an opportunity I might, perhaps, vainly &s;eek again."</P>
<P>He took her trembling hand, and leading her to a &s;o|fa, placed him&s;elf by her. As a means of leading her to the de&s;ired ecclairci&s;&s;ement, he declared the agonies he had &s;uffered at returning to Tudor Hall, and finding her gone&mdash;gone in a manner &s;o inexplicable; that the more he reflected on it, the more wretched he grew. He de|&s;cribed the hope and fears which alternately fluctuated in his mind during his continuance in Ireland, and which often drove him into a &s;tate, nearly bordering on di&s;|traction, he mentioned the re&s;olution (though painful in the extreme) which he had adopted on the fir&s;t appear|ance of Sir Charles Bingley's particularity; and finally concluded, by a&s;&s;uring her, notwith&s;tanding all his incer|titude and anxiety, his tenderne&s;s had never known di|minution.</P>
<P>Encouraged by this a&s;&s;urance, Amanda, with re&s;tored compo&s;ure, informed him of the rea&s;on of her precipitate journey from Wales, and the incidents which prevented her meeting him in Ireland, as he had expected; tho' de|licacy

<P>Re&s;tored to the confidence of Mortimer, Amanda ap|peared dearer to his &s;oul than ever; plea&s;ure beamed from his eyes as he pre&s;&s;ed her to his bo&s;om, and ex|claimed, "I may again call you my own Amanda: again &s;ketch &s;cenes of felicity, and call upon you to re|alize them." Yet in the mid&s;t of this tran&s;port, a &s;ud|den gloom clouded his countenance; and after gazing on her &s;ome minutes with pen&s;ive tenderne&s;s, he fer|vently exclaimed, "would to heaven, in this hour of perfect reconciliation I could &s;ay, that all ob&s;tacles to our future happine&s;s were removed."</P>
<P>Amanda involuntarily &s;huddered, and continued &s;i|lent.</P>
<P>"That my father will throw difficulties in the way of our union, I cannot deny my apprehen&s;ion of," &s;aid Lord Mortimer; "though truly noble and generous in his nature, he is &s;ometimes like the re&s;t of mankind, influenced by intere&s;ted motives: he had long, from &s;uch motives, &s;et his heart on a connection with the Marquis of Ro&s;line's family: though fully determined in my intentions, I have hitherto forborne an explicit declaration of them to him, tru&s;ting that &s;ome propiti|ous chance would yet &s;econd my wi&s;hes, and &s;ave me the painful nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;turbing the harmony which has ever &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between us."</P>
<P>"Oh! my Lord," &s;aid Amanda, turning pale, and &s;hrinking from him, "let me not be the unfortunate cau&s;e of di&s;turbing that harmony; comply with the wi&s;hes of Lord Cherbury, marry Lady Euphra&s;ia, and let me be forgotten."</P>
<P>"Amada," cried his Lord&s;hip, "accu&s;e not your&s;elf of being the cau&s;e of any di&s;agreement between us; had I never &s;een you, with re&s;pect to Lady Euphra&s;ia, I

&s;hould have felt the &s;ame inability to comply with his wi&s;hes; to me, her per&s;on is not more unplea&s;ing than her mind; I have long been convinced, that wealth alone was in&s;ufficient to be&s;tow felicity, and have ever con|&s;idered the man, who could &s;acrifice his feelings at the &s;hrine of intere&s;t or ambition, degraded below the &s;tand|ard of humanity; that to marry merely from &s;elfi&s;h con|&s;iderations, was one of the mo&s;t culpable, mo&s;t con|temptible actions which could be committed, to enter in|to &s;uch an union, I want the propen&s;ities which can alone ever occa&s;ion it, namely, a violent pa&s;&s;ion for the enjoy|ments only attainable through the medium of wealth. Left at an early age, uncontrouled ma&s;ter of my own actions, I drank freely of the cup of plea&s;ure, but found it &s;oon pall upon my ta&s;te; it was, indeed, unmixed with any of tho&s;e refined ingredients which can only plea&s;e the intellectual appetite, and might properly be termed the cup of fal&s;e, in&s;tead of real plea&s;ure. Thinking, there|fore, as I do, that an union, without love, is abhorrent to probity and &s;en&s;ibility, and that the di&s;&s;ipated plea|&s;ures of life are not only prejudicial, but tire&s;ome, I na|turally wi&s;h to &s;ecure to my&s;elf dome&s;tic happine&s;s, but never could it be experienced, except united to a woman whom my rea&s;on thoroughly approved, who &s;hould at once po&s;&s;e&s;s my unbounded confidence and tendere&s;t af|fection, who &s;hould be, not only the promoter of my joys, but the a&s;&s;uager of my cares; in you I have found &s;uch a woman, &s;uch a being, as I candidly confe&s;s &s;ome time ago I thought it impo&s;&s;ible to meet with; to you I am bound by a &s;entiment even &s;tronger than love, by honour, and with real gratitude acknowledge my obli|gations, in being permitted to atone, in &s;ome degree, for my errors relative to you. But I will not allow my A|manda to &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e errors proceeded from any &s;et|tled depravity of &s;oul: allowed to be, as I have before &s;aid, my own ma&s;ter, at an early period, from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he natu|ral thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s of youth, I was led into &s;cenes, which the judgment of riper years has &s;ince &s;everely condemned: here, too, often I met with women, who&s;e

manners, in&s;tead of checking, gave a latitude to free|dom: women, too, who from their &s;ituations in life, had every advantage that could be requi&s;ite for improv|ing and refining their minds; from conver&s;ing with them, I gradually imbibed a prejudice again&s;t the whole &s;ex, and under that prejudice fir&s;t beheld you, and fear|ed either to doubt or to believe the reality of the inno|cence you appeared to po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>"Convinced, at length, mo&s;t fully, mo&s;t happily con|vinced of its reality, my prejudices no longer remained, they vani&s;hed like mi&s;ts before the &s;un, or rather like the illu&s;ions of fal&s;hood before the influence of truth. Were tho&s;e, my dear Amanda, of your &s;ex, who like you had the re&s;i&s;tle&s;s power of plea&s;ing, to u&s;e the fa|culties a&s;&s;igned them by a bounteous Providence in the cau&s;e of virtue, they would &s;oon check the di&s;&s;ipation of the times.</P>
<P>"'Tis impo&s;&s;ible to expre&s;s the power a beautiful form has over a mind; that power might be exerted for nobler purpo&s;es; purity &s;peaking from love in&s;piring lips, would, like the voice of Adam's heavenly gue&s;t, &s;o &s;weetly breathe upon the ear, as in&s;en&s;ibly to influ|ence the heart; the libertine it corrected, would, if not utterly hardened, reform; no longer &s;hould he glory in his vices, but touched and aba&s;hed, in&s;tead of de&s;troy|ing, wor&s;hip female virtue.</P>
<P>"But I wander from the purpo&s;e of my &s;oul; con|vinced as I am of the di&s;&s;imilarity between my father's inclinations and mine, I think it better to give no inti|mation of my pre&s;ent intentions, which if permitted by you. I am unalterably determined on fulfilling, as I &s;hould con&s;ider it as highly in&s;ulting to him, to incur his prohibition, and then act in defiance of it though my heart would glory in avowing its choice. The peculiar circum&s;tances I have ju&s;t mentioned, will, I tru&s;t, in|duce my Amanda to excu&s;e a temporary concealment of it, till beyond the power of mortals to &s;eparate us:&mdash;A private and immediate union, the exigence of &s;itu|ation, and the &s;ecurity of felicity demands; I &s;hall feel

a trembling apprehen&s;ion till I call you mine: life is too &s;hort to permit the wa&s;te of time in idle &s;cruples and un|meaning ceremonies; the eye of &s;u&s;picion has long re&s;ted on us, and would, I am convinced, effect a premature di&s;covery, if we took not &s;ome mea&s;ure to prevent it.</P>
<P>"Deem me not too precipitate, my Amanda," pa&s;&s;ing his arm gently round her wai&s;t, "if I a&s;k you to-mor|row night, for the la&s;t &s;weet proof of confidence you can give me, by putting your&s;elf under my protection: a journey to Scotland is unavoidable; in the arrange|ments I &s;hall make for it, all that is due to delicacy I &s;hall con&s;ider.</P>
<P>"Mention it no more, my Lord," &s;aid Amanda, in a faultering accent; "no longer delude your imagina|tion, or mine, with the hopes of being united."</P>
<P>Hitherto &s;he had believed the approbation of Lord Cherbury to the wi&s;hes of his &s;on would be obtained, the moment he was convinced how e&s;&s;ential their grati|fication was to his felicity; &s;he judged of him by her father, who, &s;he was convinced, if &s;ituations were rever|&s;ed, would be&s;tow her on Mortimer without he&s;itation. The&s;e ideas &s;o nouri&s;hed her attachment, that like the vital parts of exi&s;tence, it at length became painfully, almo&s;t fatally &s;u&s;ceptible of every &s;hock. Her dream of happine&s;s was over, the moment &s;he heard Lord Cherbu|ry's con&s;ent was not to be a&s;ked, from a fear of its being refu&s;ed:&mdash;'T was mi&s;ery to be &s;eparated from Lord Mor|timer, but it was guilt and mi&s;ery to marry him clande&s;|tinely, after the &s;olemn injunction her father had given her again&s;t &s;uch a &s;tep. The &s;hock of di&s;appointment could not be borne with compo&s;ure; it pre&s;t like a cold dead weight upon her heart; &s;he trembled, and unable to &s;upport her&s;elf, &s;unk again&s;t the &s;houlder of Lord Mortimer, while a &s;hower of tears proclaimed her ago|ny. Alarmed by her emotion, Lord Mortimer ha&s;tily demanded its &s;ource, and the rea&s;on of the words which had ju&s;t e&s;caped her.</P>
<P>"Becau&s;e, my, Lord," replied &s;he, "I cannot con|&s;ent to a clende&s;tine mea&s;ure, nor bear you &s;hould in|cur the di&s;plea&s;ure of Lord Cherbury on my account.

Though lady Euphra&s;ia Sutherland is not agreeable, there are many women, who, with equal rank and for|tune, po&s;&s;e&s;s the perfections &s;uited to your ta&s;te: &s;eek for one of the&s;e; choo&s;e from among them a happy daughter of pro&s;perity, and let Amanda, untitled, un|portioned, and unplea&s;ing to your father, return to an ob&s;curity, which owes its comforts to his fo&s;tering boun|ty." "Does this advice," a&s;ked Lord Mortimer, "pro|ceed from Amanda's heart." "No," replied &s;he, he&s;i|tatingly, and &s;miling through her tears, "not from her heart, but from a better coun&s;ellor, her rea&s;on."</P>
<P>"And &s;hall I not obey the dictates of rea&s;on," repli|ed he, "in uniting my de&s;tiny to yours: rea&s;on directs us to &s;eek happine&s;s through virtuous means; and what means are &s;o adapted for that purpo&s;e, as an union with a beloved and amiable woman?&mdash;No, Amanda, no ti|tled daughter of pro&s;perity, to u&s;e your own words, &s;hall ever attract my affections from you, "Imagination cannot form a &s;hape be&s;ides your own to like of," a &s;hape which even, if de&s;poiled of its graces, would en&s;hrine a mind &s;o tran&s;cendantly lovely, as to &s;ecure my admira|tion. In choo&s;ing you as a partner of my future days, I do not infringe the moral obligation which exi&s;ts be|tween father and &s;on; for as, on one hand, it does not require weak indulgence; &s;o, on the other, it does not demand implicit obedience, if rea&s;on, and happine&s;s mu&s;t be &s;acrificed by it. Nothing &s;hould have tempted me to propo&s;e a private union, but the hope of e&s;caping many di&s;agreeable circum&s;tances by it: if you per&s;i&s;t, however, in rejecting it, I &s;hall openly avow my inten|tions, for a longer continuance of anxiety and &s;u&s;pen&s;e I cannot &s;upport.</P>
<P>"Do you think, then," &s;aid Amanda, "I would en|ter your family amid&s;t confu&s;ion and altercation? No, my Lord, ra&s;hly or clande&s;tinely I never will con&s;ent to enter it."</P>
<P>"Is this the happine&s;s I promi&s;ed my&s;elf would crown our reconciliation?" exclaimed Lord Mortimer, ri&s;ing ha&s;tily, and traver&s;ing the apartment: "Is an ob&s;tinate adherence to rigid punctilio, the only proof of regard I

&s;hall receieve from Amanda? Will &s;he make no trifling &s;acrifice to the man who adores her, and whom &s;he pro|fe&s;&s;es to e&s;teem?"</P>
<P>"Any &s;acrifice, my Lord, compatible with virtue and filial duty, mo&s;t willingly would I make; but be|yond the&s;e limits, I mu&s;t not, cannot, will not &s;tep.&mdash;Cold, joyle&s;s, and unworthy of your acceptance, would be the hand you would receive, if given again&s;t my con|viction of what was right.

<P>"Do not be too inflexible, my Amanda," cried Lord Mortimer, re&s;uming his &s;eat, "nor &s;uffer too great a degree of refinement to involve you in wretchedne&s;s: felicity is &s;eldom attained without &s;ome pain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a little re&s;olution on your &s;ide, would overcome any difficulties that lay between us and it; when the act was pa&s;t, my father would naturally lo&s;e his re&s;entment, from per|ceiving its inefficacy, and family concord would &s;peedily be re&s;tored. Araminta adores you; with rapture would &s;he receive her dear and lovely &s;i&s;ter to her bo&s;om; your father, happy in your happine&s;s, would be convinced his notions heretofore were too &s;crupulous, and that in com|plying with my wi&s;hes, you had neither violated your own delicacy, or tarni&s;hed his hohour."</P>
<P>"Ah, my Lord, your arguments have not the effect you de&s;ire: I cannot be deluded by them, to view things in the light you wi&s;h: to unite my&s;elf clande&s;tinely to you, would be to fly in the face of parental authority: to be propo&s;ed to Lord Cherbury, when almo&s;t certain of a refu&s;al, would not only &s;ubject me to in&s;ult, but di&s;|&s;olve the friend&s;hip which has hitherto &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between his Lord&s;hip and my father. Situated as we are, our only expedient is to &s;eparate; 'tis ab&s;urd to think longer of a connection, again&s;t which there are &s;uch ob&s;tacles: the ta&s;k of trying to forget, will be ea&s;ier to you, my Lord, than you now perhaps imagine; the &s;cenes you

mu&s;t be engaged in, are well calculated to expunge painful remembrances: in the retirement my de&s;tiny has doomed me to, my efforts will not be wanting to render me equally &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>The tears trickled down Amanda's pale cheeks as &s;he &s;poke; &s;he believed that they mu&s;t part, and the belief was attended with a pang of unutterable angui&s;h: plea&s;|ed and pained by her &s;en&s;ibility, Lord Mortimer bent forward, and looked in her face.</P>
<P>"Are the&s;e tears," &s;aid he, "to enforce me to the only expedient you &s;ay remains? Ah, my Amanda," cla&s;ping her to his brea&s;t, "the ta&s;k of forgetting you could never be accompli&s;hed&mdash;could never be attempt|ed: life would be ta&s;tele&s;s, if not &s;pent with you; never will I relinqui&s;h the delightful hope of an union yet taking place. A &s;udden thought," re&s;umed he, after pau&s;ing a few minutes, "has ju&s;t occurred; I have an aunt, the only remaining &s;i&s;ter of Lord Cherbury, a ge|nerous, tender, exalted woman; I have ever been her particular favourite; my Amanda, I know, is the very kind of being &s;he would &s;elect, if the choice devolved on her, for my wife; &s;he is now in the country, I will write immediately, inform her of our &s;ituation, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> treat her to come up to town, to u&s;e her influence with my father in our favour.

This is the only &s;cheme I can po&s;&s;ibly devi&s;e for the completion of our happine&s;s, according, to your notions, and I hope it meets your approbation."</P>
<P>It appeared, indeed, a fea&s;ible one to Amanda; and as it could not po&s;&s;ibly excite any ideas unfavourable to her father's integrity, &s;he gave her con&s;ent to its being tried.</P>
<P>Her heart felt relieved of an oppre&s;&s;ive load, as the hope revived that it might be accompli&s;hed. Lord Mortimer wiped away her tears and the cloud which hung over them both being di&s;per&s;ed, they talked with plea&s;ure of future days.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="038416_0303_1011E39DB4A1E850">
Lord Mortimer de&s;cribed the various &s;chemes he had planned for their mode of life. Amanda &s;miled at the ea&s;ine&s;s with which he contrived them, and &s;ecretly wi&s;hed he might find it as ea&s;y to realize as to project.</P>
<P>"Though the retired path of life," &s;aid he, "might be more agreeable to us, than the frequented and public one, we mu&s;t make &s;ome little &s;acrifice of inclination to the community to which we belong. On an elevated &s;tation and affluent fortune, there are claims from &s;ub|ordinate ranks, which cannot be avoided without injur|ing them; neither &s;hould I wi&s;h to hide the beautiful gem I &s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s in ob&s;curity; but after a winter of what I call moderate di&s;&s;ipation, we will ha&s;ten to the &s;eque&s;tered &s;hades of Tudor Hall. He dwelt with plea|&s;ure on the calm and rational joys they &s;hould experience there; nor could forbear hinting at the period when new tenderne&s;&s;es, new &s;ympathies would be awakened in their &s;ouls: when little prattling beings &s;hould frolick before them, and literally &s;trew ro&s;es in their paths. He ex|pre&s;&s;ed his wi&s;h of having Fitzalan a con&s;tant re&s;ident with them; and was proceeding to mention &s;ome al|terations he intended at Tudor Hall, when the return of Lady Grey&s;tock's carriage effectually di&s;turbed him.</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer, however, had time to a&s;&s;ure Aman|da, ere &s;he entered the room, that he had no doubt but every thing would be &s;oon &s;ettled according to their wi&s;hes, and that he would take every opportunity her Lady&s;hip's ab&s;ence gave him of vi&s;iting her.</P>
<P>"So, &s;o," &s;aid Lady Grey&s;tock, coming into the room, "this has been Mi&s;s Fitzalan's levee day; why I declare, my dear, now that I know of the agreeable tete-a-tetes you can enjoy, I &s;hall feel no unea&s;ine&s;s at leaving you to your&s;elf."</P>
<P>Amanda blu&s;hed deeply, and Lord Mortimer thought in this &s;peech he perceived a degree of irony, which &s;eemed to &s;ay all was not right in the &s;peaker's heart to|wards Amanda; and on this account he felt more anxi|ous than ever to have her under his own protection; ani|mated by the idea that this would &s;oon be the ca&s;e, he told her Lady&s;hip, &s;miling, "She &s;hould be obliged to

him, or any other per&s;on, who could relieve her mind from unea&s;ine&s;s," and departed.</P>
<P>This had been a bu&s;y, an intere&s;ting day to Amanda, and the variety of emotions it had given ri&s;e to, produ|ced a languor in her mind and frame &s;he could not &s;hake off.</P>
<P>Her expectations were not as &s;anguine as Lord Mor|timer's: once &s;everely di&s;appointed, &s;he dreaded again to give too great a latitude to hope: happine&s;s was in view, but &s;he doubted much whether it would ever be within her reach; yet the pain of &s;u&s;pen&s;e &s;he endea|voured to alleviate, by reflecting, that every event was under the direction of a &s;uperior being, who knew be&s;t what would con&s;titute the felicity of his creatures.</P>
<P>Lady Grey&s;tock learned from her maid the length of Lord Martimer's vi&s;it, and &s;he was convinced, from that circum&s;tance, as well as from the looks and ab&s;ent man|ner of Amanda, that &s;omething material had happened in the cour&s;e of it. In the evening they were engaged to a party, and ere they &s;eparated after dinner, to dre&s;s for it, a plain looking woman was &s;hewn into the room, who Amanda in&s;tantly recollected to be the per&s;on, at who&s;e hou&s;e &s;he and her father had lodged on quitting Devon&s;hire, to &s;ecrete them&s;elves from Colonel Belgrave. This woman had been bribed to &s;erve him, and had for|ced &s;everal letters upon Amanda, who, therefore, natu|rally abhorred the &s;ight of a per&s;on that had joined in &s;o infamous a plot again&s;t her; and to her exclamation of &s;urpri&s;e and plea&s;ure, only returned a cool bow, and directly left the room. She was vexed at &s;eeing this woman. The conduct of Colonel Belgrave had hither|to been concealed, from motives of pride and delicacy; and to Lady Grey&s;tock, of all other beings, &s;he wi&s;h|ed it not revealed; her only hope of its not being &s;o, was, that this woman, on her own account, would not mention it, as &s;he mu&s;t be con&s;cious, that her efforts to &s;erve him were not undi&s;covered.</P>
<P>Mrs. Jennings had been hou&s;ekeeper to Lady Grey|&s;tock during her re&s;idence in England, and &s;o &s;ucce&s;s|fully ingratiated her&s;elf into her favour, that though

di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from her &s;ervice, &s;he yet retained it. Lady Grey&s;tock was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee &s;he and Amanda knew each other, and inquired minutely how the acquaintance had commenced. The manner in which &s;he men|tioned Amanda, convinced Mrs. Jennings &s;he was not high in her e&s;timation, and from this conviction, &s;he thought &s;he might &s;afely a&s;&s;ert any fal&s;ehood &s;he plea&s;ed again&s;t her. As &s;he knew enough of her Lady's di&s;po|&s;ition, to be a&s;&s;ured &s;he never would contradict an a&s;&s;er|tion to the prejudice of a per&s;on &s;he di&s;liked, by what &s;he de&s;igned &s;aying, &s;he tru&s;ted any thing Amanda might &s;ay again&s;t her, would appear malicious, and that &s;he &s;hould al&s;o be revenged for the di&s;dainful air with which &s;he had regarded her.</P>
<P>She told her Lady&s;hip, "that near a year back, Mi&s;s Fitzalan had been a lodger of her's, as al&s;o an old offi|cer, &s;he called her father; but had &s;he known what kind of people they were, &s;he never would have admitted them into her hou&s;e. Mi&s;s was followed by &s;uch a &s;et of gallants, &s;he really thought the reputation of her hou&s;e would have been ruined. Among them was a Colonel Belgrave, a &s;ad rake, who &s;he believed was the favour|ite. She was determined on making them decamp, when &s;uddenly Mi&s;s went off, nobody knew where, but it might ea&s;ily be gue&s;t &s;he did not travel alone, for the Colonel di&s;appeared at the &s;ame time."</P>
<P>The character of Fitzalan, and the uniform propriety of Amanda's conduct, forbid Lady Grey&s;tock's giving implicit credit to what Mrs. Jennings &s;aid; &s;he perceiv|ed in it the exaggerations of malice and fal&s;hood, oc|ca&s;ioned, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, by di&s;appointed avarice, or of|fended pride. She re&s;olved, however, to relate all &s;he heard to the Marchione&s;s, without betraying the &s;mall|e&s;t doubt of its veracity.</P>
<P>It may appear &s;trange that Lady Grey&s;tock, after taking Amanda, un&s;olicited, under her protection, &s;hould without any cau&s;e for enmity, &s;eek to injure her: but Lady Grey&s;tock was a woman devoid of principle: from &s;elfi&s;h motives &s;he had taken Amanda, and from &s;elfi&s;h motives &s;he was ready to &s;acrifice her. Her Lady&s;hip
<PB N="113" REF="038416_0306_1011E3A4067BA718">
had enjoyed &s;o much happine&s;s in her matrimonial con|nexions, that &s;he had no objection again to enter the li&s;ts of Hymen, and Lord Cherbury was the object at which her pre&s;ent wi&s;hes pointed. The Marchione&s;s had hinted, in pretty plain terms, that if &s;he counter|acted Lord Mortimer's intentions re&s;pecting Amanda, &s;he would forward her's relative to Lord Cherbury.</P>
<P>She thought what Mrs. Jennings had alledged would effectually forward their plans; as &s;he knew, if called upon, &s;he would &s;upport it. The next morning &s;he went to Portman Square, to communicate her impor|tant intelligence to the Marchione&s;s and Lady Eu|phra&s;ia.</P>
<P>Joy and exultation &s;at upon their features, at receiv|ing this intere&s;ting communication, which opened &s;o charming a pro&s;pect of &s;eparating Lord Mortimer from Amanda, by giving them the power of injuring her character. This joy and exultation they deemed requi|&s;ite for &s;ome time to conceal: they con&s;idered their mea|&s;ures would be more &s;ucce&s;sful for being gradually brought about, and therefore re&s;olved rather to under|mine, than directly &s;trike at the peace of Amanda.</P>
<P>Like Lady Grey&s;tock, they di&s;believed Mrs. Jen|ning's tale; but like her Lady&s;hip, confined this di&s;|belief to their own bo&s;oms. In the manner, the ap|pearance of Amanda, there was an innocence, a mild|ne&s;s that denoted &s;omething holy dwelt within her brea&s;t, and forbid the entrance of any impure or wayward pa&s;|&s;ions: be&s;ides, from a gentleman who had pre&s;ided in Devon&s;hire, they learned the di&s;tre&s;s Fitzalan was re|duced to, by Belgrave's revenge for the virtue of his daughter. This gentleman was now, however, on the continent, and they had no fear of their allegations again&s;t Amanda being contradicted, or their &s;chemes again&s;t her being overthrown.</P>
<P>After &s;ome con&s;ultation, it was agreed, as a means of expediting their plot, that lady Grey&s;tock and A|manda &s;hould immediately remove to the Marchione&s;s's hou&s;e; by this change of abode too, Lord Mortimer would be prevented taking any material &s;tep relative to
<PB N="114" REF="038416_0307_1011E3A79FB66498">
Amanda, till the period arrived, when his own inclina|tion would, mo&s;t probably, render any further trouble on that account unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Lady Grey&s;tock, on her return to Pall-Mall, after a warm eulogium on the friend&s;hip of the Marchione&s;s, mentioned the invitation &s;he had given them to her hou&s;e, which &s;he declared &s;he could not refu&s;e, as it was made from an ardent de&s;ire of enjoying more of their &s;o|ciety than &s;he had hitherto done, during their &s;hort &s;tay in London. She al&s;o told Amanda, that both the Marchione&s;s and Lady Euphra&s;ia had expre&s;t a tender regard for her, and a wi&s;h of proving to the world, that any coolne&s;s which exi&s;ted between their families, was removed by her becoming their gue&s;t.</P>
<P>This projected removal was extremely di&s;agreeable to Amanda, as it not only terminated the morning in|terviews which were to take place between her and Lord Mortimer, during the ab&s;ence of lady Grey&s;tock with her lawyers, but threatened to impo&s;e a re&s;traint on her looks, as well as actions, being confident, from the views and &s;u&s;picions of Lady Euphra&s;ia, &s;he &s;hould continual|ly be watched with the clo&s;e&s;t circum&s;pection. Her part, however, was acquie&s;cence; the lodgings were di&s;charged, and the next morning they took up their re&s;idence under the Marquis of Ro&s;line's roof, to the infinite &s;urpri&s;e and mortification of Lord Mortimer, who, like Amanda, anticipated the di&s;agreeable con&s;e|quences which would re&s;ult from it.</P>
<P>The altered manner of the Marchione&s;s and Lady Euphra&s;ia, &s;urpri&s;ed Amanda; they received her not merely with politene&s;s, but affection: recapitulated all Lady Grey&s;tock had already &s;aid, concerning their re|gard: bid her con&s;ider her&s;elf entirely at home in their hou&s;e and appointed a maid &s;olely to attend her.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding their former cool, even contemp|tuous conduct, Amanda, the child of innocence and &s;implicity, could not believe the alteration in their manners feigned, &s;he rather believed that her own pa|tience and humility had at length conciliated their re|gard&punc; the idea plea&s;ed her, and like every other, which
<PB N="115" REF="038416_0308_1011E3AA12146718">
&s;he &s;uppo&s;ed could give her father &s;atisfaction, it was in&s;tantly communicated to him.</P>
<P>She found her&s;elf mo&s;t agreeably mi&s;taken, relative to the re&s;traint &s;he had feared: &s;he was perfect mi&s;tre&s;s of her own time and actions; and when &s;he &s;aw Lord Mortimer, no louring looks, no &s;tudied interference, as heretofore, from the Marchione&s;s or Lady Euphra&s;ia, prevented their frequently conver&s;ing together. The Marchione&s;s made her &s;everal elegant pre&s;ents, and La|dy Euphra&s;ia frequently dropt the formal appellation of Mi&s;s Fitzalan, for the more familiar one of Amanda.</P>
<P>Sir Charles Bingley, agreeable to his re&s;olution of not relinqui&s;hing Amanda, without another effort for her favour, &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in his attentions, and vi&s;ited con&s;tantly at the Marquis's.</P>
<P>Amanda had been about a fortnight in Portman|Square, when &s;he went one night with the Marchione&s;s, Lady Euphra&s;ia, Mi&s;s Malcolm, and Lady Grey&s;tock, to the Pantheon. Lord Mortimer had told her, that if he could po&s;&s;ibly leave a particular party he was enga|ged to, he would be there. She therefore, on that ac|count, wi&s;hed to keep her&s;elf di&s;engaged; but imme|diately, on her entrance, &s;he was joined by Sir Charles Bingley, and &s;he found &s;he mu&s;t either dance with him as he reque&s;ted, or con&s;ent to li&s;ten to his u&s;ual conver|&s;ation; and &s;he cho&s;e the fir&s;t, as being lea&s;t particu|lar. The dancing over, Sir Charles was conducting her to get &s;ome refre&s;hment, when a gentleman ha&s;tily &s;tepping forward, &s;aluted him by his name. Amanda &s;tarted at the &s;ound of the voice, &s;he rai&s;ed her eyes, and with equal horror and &s;urpri&s;e, beheld Colonel Bel|grave.</P>
<P>She turned pale, trembled, and involuntarily ex|claimed, "Gracious heaven!" her &s;oul recoiled at the &s;ight, as if an evil genius had &s;uddenly darted into her path, to bla&s;t her hopes of happine&s;s: &s;ickening with emotion, her head grew giddy, and &s;he caught Sir Charles's arm, to prevent her falling.</P>
<P>Alarmed by her palene&s;s and agitation, he ha&s;tily de|manded the cau&s;e of her di&s;order: willing to believe,
<PB N="116" REF="038416_0309_1011E3AD069F6B58">
notwith&s;tanding what he had &s;een, that it did not pro|ceed from the &s;ight of Colonel Belgrave. "Oh take me, take me from this room," was all in faultering ac|cents, Amanda could pronounce, &s;till leaning on him for &s;upport. Colonel Belgrave enquired tenderly what they could do to &s;erve her, and at the &s;ame time at|tempted to take her hand. She &s;hrunk from his touch, with a look of expre&s;&s;ive horror, and again be&s;ought Sir Charles to take her from the room, and procure her a conveyance home. Her agitation now became conta|gious; it was vi&s;ible to Sir Charles that it proceeded from &s;eeing Colonel Belgrave, and he trembled as he &s;upported her.</P>
<P>Belgrave offered his &s;ervices in a&s;&s;i&s;ting to &s;upport her from the room, but &s;he motioned with her hand to re|pul&s;e him.</P>
<P>At the door they met Lord Mortimer entering. Ter|rified by the &s;ituation of Amanda, all caution, all re&s;erve for&s;ook him, and his rapid and impa&s;&s;ioned enquiries be|trayed the tender intere&s;t &s;he had in his heart. Unable to an&s;wer them her&s;elf, Sir Charles replied for her, &s;ay|ing, "&s;he had been taken extremely ill after dancing," and added, "he would re&s;ign her to his Lord&s;hip's pro|tection while he went to procure her a chair."</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer received the lovely trembler in his arms; he &s;oftly called her his Amanda, the beloved of his &s;oul, and &s;he began to revive: his pre&s;ence was at once a relief and comfort to her, and his language &s;ooth|ed the perturbations of her mind; but as &s;he rai&s;ed her head from his &s;houlder, &s;he beheld Colonel Belgrave &s;tanding near them. His invidious eyes fa&s;tened on her; &s;he averted her head, and &s;aying the air would do her good, Lord Mortimer led her forward, and took this opportunity of expre&s;&s;ing his wi&s;hes for the period, when he &s;hould be at liberty to watch over her with guar|dian care, &s;ooth every weakne&s;s, and &s;often every care.</P>
<P>In a few minutes Sir Charles returned, and told her he had procured a chair. She thanked him with grate|ful &s;weetne&s;s for his attention, and reque&s;ted Lord Mor|timer to acquaint the ladies with the rea&s;on of her ab|rupt
<PB N="117" REF="038416_0310_1011E3B0A27F8718">
departure. His Lord&s;hip wi&s;hed him&s;elf to have attended her to Portman Square, but &s;he thought it would appear too particular, and would not &s;uffer him. She retired to her room, immediately on her return, and endeavoured though un&s;ucce&s;sfully, to compo&s;e her &s;pirits.</P>
<P>The di&s;tre&s;s &s;he &s;uffered from Belgrave's conduct, had left an impre&s;&s;ion on her mind, which could not be eras|ed; the terror his pre&s;ence in&s;pired, was too powerful for rea&s;on to conquer, and rai&s;ed the mo&s;t gloomy pre&s;ages, in her mind; &s;he believed him capable of any villainy: his looks had declared a continuance of illicit love; &s;he trembled at the idea of his &s;tratagems being renewed; her apprehen&s;ions were doubly painful, from the nece&s;|&s;ity of concealment, le&s;t tho&s;e dearer to her than exi&s;t|ence, &s;hould be involved in danger on her account. To heaven &s;he looked up for protection, and the terrors of her heart were &s;omewhat le&s;&s;ened, con&s;cious that heaven could render the aims of Belgrave again&s;t her peace, as abortive as tho&s;e again&s;t her innocence had been.</P>
<P>Sir Charles Bingley parted from Lord Mortimer im|mediately after Amanda's departure, and returned arm in arm with Belgrave to the room. "Belgrave" &s;aid he abruptly, after mu&s;ing &s;ome minutes, "you know Mi&s;s Fitzalan?</P>
<P>Belgrave an&s;wered not ha&s;tily: he appeared as if de|liberating on the reply he &s;hould give; at la&s;t, "I do know Mi&s;s Fitzalan," cried he, "her father was my tenant in Devon&s;hire; &s;he is one of the lovelie&s;t girls I ever knew."</P>
<P>"Lovely indeed," &s;aid Sir Charles with a deep and involuntary &s;igh, "but it is &s;omewhat extraordinary to me, that in&s;tead of noticing you as a friend of acquaint|ance, &s;he &s;hould look alarmed and agitated, as if &s;he had &s;een an enemy."</P>
<P>"My dear Bingley," exclaimed Belgrave, "&s;urely at this time of day, you cannot be a &s;tranger to the unac|countable caprices of the female mind."</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="038416_0311_1011E3B22E5E0A78">
" 'Tis very extraordinary to me, I own" re&s;umed Sir Charles, "that Mi&s;s Fitzalan &s;hould behave as &s;he did to you: Were you and her family ever very intimate?"</P>
<P>An invidious &s;mile lurked on Belgrave's countenance at this que&s;tion.</P>
<P>"Belgrave," exclaimed Sir Charles, pa&s;&s;ionately, your manner appears &s;o my&s;terious, that it di&s;tracts me; if friend&s;hip will not induce you to account for it, my intentions, relative to Mi&s;s Fitzalan, will compel me to in&s;i&s;t on your doing &s;o."</P>
<P>"Come, come, Bingley," replied the colonel, "this is not a country for extorting confe&s;&s;ion; however &s;erious|ly you might depend on my honour, exclu&s;ive of my friend&s;hip, to conceal nothing from you, in which you were materially intere&s;ted." So &s;aying, he &s;natched away his arm, ru&s;hed into the crowd, and in&s;tantly di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>This a&s;&s;urance, however, could not calm the di&s;qui|etude of Sir Charles; his &s;oul was tortured with impa|tience and anxiety for an explanation of the my&s;tery, which the agitation of Amanda, and the eva&s;ive an&s;wers of Belgrave had betrayed. He &s;ought the latter through the room, till convinced of his departure, and re&s;olved the next morning to intreat him to deal candidly with him.</P>
<P>Agreeable to this re&s;olution, he was preparing, after breakfa&s;t, for his vi&s;it, when the letter was brought him, which contained the following lines:</P>
<P>"If Sir Charles Bingley has the lea&s;t regard for his honour or tranquillity, he will immediately relinqui&s;h his intentions relative to Mi&s;s Fitzalan; this caution comes from a &s;incere friend, from a per&s;on whom delica|cy, not want of veracity, urges to this &s;ecret mode of giving it."</P>
<P>Sir Charles peru&s;ed and re-peru&s;ed the letter, as if doubting the evidence of his eyes: he at la&s;t flung it from him, and cla&s;ping his hands together, exclaimed, "This is indeed a horrible explanation:" he took up the dete&s;ted paper; again he examined the characters,
<PB N="119" REF="038416_0312_1011D035303E24B8">
and recognized the writing of Colonel Belgrave. He ha&s;tily &s;natched up his hat, and with the paper in his hand, flew directly to his hou&s;e: the Colonel was alone.</P>
<P>"Belgrave," &s;aid Sir Charles, in almo&s;t breathle&s;s agitation, "are you the author of this letter?" pre|&s;enting it to him.</P>
<P>Belgrave took it, read it, but continued &s;ilent.</P>
<P>"Oh! Belgrave," exclaimed Sir Charles, in a voice trembling with agony, "pity and relieve my &s;u&s;pen&s;e.</P>
<P>"I am the author of it," replied Belgrave, with &s;o|lemnity, "Mi&s;s Fitzalan and I were once tenderly at|tached; I tru&s;t I am no deliberate libertine; but when a lovely, &s;educing girl was thrown purpo&s;ely in my way&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Oh &s;top," &s;aid Sir Charles, "to me any extenua|tion of your conduct is unnece&s;&s;ary; 'tis &s;ufficient to know, that Mi&s;s Fitzalan and I are for ever &s;eparated." His emotion overpowered him&mdash;he leaned on a table, and covered his face with a handkerchief.</P>
<P>"The &s;hock I have received," &s;aid he, "almo&s;t un|mans me: Amanda was&mdash;alas, I mu&s;t &s;ay, is dear, in|expre&s;&s;ibly dear to my &s;oul; I thought her the mo&s;t lovely, the mo&s;t e&s;timable of women, and the angui&s;h I now feel, is more on her account than my own; I cannot bear the idea of the contempt which may fall upon her: Oh Belgrave, 'tis melancholy to behold a human being, &s;o endowed by nature as &s;he is, in&s;en&s;ible or unworthy of her ble&s;&s;ings. Amanda," he continued, after a pau&s;e, "never encouraged me, I therefore can|not accu&s;e her of intending deceit."</P>
<P>"She never encouraged you," replied Belgrave, "becau&s;e &s;he was ambitious of a higher title; Amanda, beneath a &s;pecious appearance of innocence, conceals a light di&s;po&s;ition, and a de&s;igning heart; &s;he a&s;pires to Mortimer's hand, and may probably &s;ucceed, for his language and attentions to her la&s;t night, were tho&s;e of a tender lover."</P>
<P>"I &s;hall return immediately to Ireland," &s;aid Sir Charles, "and endeavour to forget I have ever &s;een her; &s;he has made me indeed experience all the fervency of
<PB N="120" REF="038416_0313_1011E3B6E6B48DD8">
love, and bitterne&s;s of di&s;appointment; what I felt for her, I think I &s;hall never again feel for any woman.</P>
<LG>
<L>I'll lock up all the gates of love,</L>
<L>And on my eye-lids &s;hall conjecture hang,</L>
<L>To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,</L>
<L>And never more &s;hall it be gracious.</L>
</LG>
<P>Sir Charles Bingley, and Colonel Belgrave, in early life, had contracted a friend&s;hip for each other, which time had &s;trengthened in one, but reduced to a mere &s;hadow in the other. On meeting the Colonel unex|pectedly in town, Sir Charles had informed him of his in|tentions relative to Amanda. His heart throbbed at the mention of her name; he had long endeavoured to di&s;|cover her; pride, love, and revenge, were all concerned in the accompli&s;hment of his de&s;igns, which di&s;appoint|ment had only &s;timulated. He was one of tho&s;e deter|mined characters, which never relinqui&s;h a purpo&s;e, "though heaven and earth that purpo&s;e cro&s;t." The confidence Sir Charles repo&s;ed in him, joined to his warm and un&s;u&s;picious temper, convinced him he would be credulous enough to believe any imputation he &s;hould ca&s;t on Amanda; he therefore lo&s;t no time in contriving his execrable &s;cheme, without the &s;malle&s;t compunction for de&s;troying the reputation of an innocent girl, or in|juring the happine&s;s of an amiable man.</P>
<P>Removed from the protection of her father, he believ|ed his de&s;tined victim could not e&s;cape the &s;nare he &s;hould &s;pread for her; and as means of expediting his &s;ucce&s;s, under the appearance of feeling, urged Sir Charles's return to Ireland.</P>
<P>The ea&s;y credit which Sir Charles gave to the vile allegations of Belgrave, cannot be wondered at, when his long intimacy, and total ignorance of his real charac|ter is con&s;idered. He knew Belgrave to be a gay man, but he never imagined him to be a hardened libertine; be&s;ides <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e never could have &s;uppo&s;ed any man would have been &s;o audacious, or &s;ufficiently ba&s;e, as to make &s;uch an a&s;&s;ertion as Belgrave had done again&s;t Amanda, without truth for its &s;upport.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="038416_0314_1011E3BA63A0B658">
The errors of his friend, though the &s;ource of un|&s;peakable angui&s;h to him, were more pitied than con|demned, as he rather believed they proceeded from the impetuo&s;ity of pa&s;&s;ion, than the deliberation of de&s;ign, and that they were long &s;ince &s;incerely repented of.</P>
<P>Amanda could not be forgotten, the hold &s;he had on his heart, could not ea&s;ily be &s;haken off, and like the recording angel, he was often tempted to drop a tear over her faults, and obliterate them forever from his memory; this, however, was con&s;idered the mere &s;ug|ge&s;tion of weakne&s;s, and he ordered immediate prepara|tions to be made for his return to Ireland.</P>

<P>LORD Mortimer, di&s;tre&s;t by the indi&s;po&s;i|tion of Amanda, ha&s;tened, at an earlier hour than u&s;ual (for his morning vi&s;its) to Portman Square, and was u&s;hered into Lady Euphra&s;ia's dre&s;&s;ing room, where &s;he and Mi&s;s Malcolm, who had continued with her the pre|ceding night, were &s;itting tete-a-tete at breakfa&s;t. His Lord&s;hip was a welcome vi&s;itor, but it was &s;oon obvi|ous on who&s;e account he had made his appearance, for &s;carcely were the u&s;ual compliments over, 'ere he in|quired about Mi&s;s Fitzalan.</P>
<P>Lady Euphra&s;ia &s;aid, "&s;he was &s;till unwell, and had not yet left her apartment."</P>
<P>"She has not recovered the &s;urpri&s;e of la&s;t night," exclaimed Mi&s;s Malcolm, with a malicious &s;mile.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="038416_0315_1011E3BD0E59C848">
"What &s;urpri&s;e?" a&s;ked his Lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>"Dear me" replied Mi&s;s Malcolm, "was not your Lord&s;hip pre&s;ent at the time &s;he met Colonel Bel|grave?"</P>
<P>"No," &s;aid Lord Mortimer, changing colour, "I was not pre&s;ent: But what has Colonel Belgrave to &s;ay to Mi&s;s Fitzalan?" a&s;ked he, in an agitated voice.</P>
<P>"That is a que&s;tion your Lord&s;hip mu&s;t put to the young lady her&s;elf," an&s;wered Mi&s;s Malcolm.</P>
<P>"Now I declare," cried Lady Euphra&s;ia, addre&s;&s;ing her friend, " 'tis very probable her illne&s;s did not pro|ceed from &s;eeing Colonel Belgrave; you know &s;he never mentioned being acquainted with him, though her fa|ther was his tenant in Devon&s;hire."</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer grew more di&s;turbed, and ro&s;e ab|ruptly.</P>
<P>Lady Euphra&s;ia mentioned their intention of going that evening to the play, and invited him to be of the party; he accepted her invitation, and retired.</P>
<P>His vi&s;ible di&s;tre&s;s was a &s;ource of infinite mirth to the young ladies, which they indulged the moment he quitted the room. The circum&s;tance relative to Bel|grave, the Marchione&s;s had informed them of; as &s;he and Lady Grey&s;tock were near Amanda when &s;he met <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">im.</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer was unhappy; the mind which has once harboured &s;u&s;picion, will, from the mo&s;t trivial circum&s;tance, be tempted again to give admi&s;&s;ion to the unplea&s;ing gue&s;t; nor was it a trivial circum&s;tance which di&s;compo&s;ed the too &s;u&s;ceptible heart of Morti|mer. The &s;udden illne&s;s of Amanda, her extraordina|ry agitation, her eagerne&s;s to quit the room, the clo&s;e, though &s;ilent attendance of Belgrave; all the&s;e, I &s;ay, when recalled to recollection, gave an air of probability to Mi&s;s Malcolm's in&s;inuation, that her di&s;order was oc|ca&s;ioned by &s;eeing him. From re&s;iding more con&s;tantly in England than Sir Charles Bingley had done, he had had more opportunities of learning Belgrave's real cha|racter, which he knew to be that of a profe&s;t libertine. It was &s;trange, he thought, that when Amanda inform|ed
<PB N="123" REF="038416_0316_1011E3BFB04F0508">
him &s;he once re&s;ided in Devon&s;hire, &s;he &s;hould con|ceal her father's being the Colonel's tenant: he began to think her reluctance to a clande&s;tine and immediate marriage, might have proceeded from &s;ome &s;ecret at|tachment, and not from the &s;trict adherence of filial du|ty, which had exalted her &s;o much in his opinion.</P>
<P>Yet the idea was &s;carcely formed ere he endeavoured to &s;uppre&s;s it; he &s;tarted as if from an unea&s;y dream, and wondered how he could have conceived this, or any other idea, injurious to Amanda; he felt a degree of re|mor&s;e at having allowed her, for a moment to be le&s;&s;en|ed in his opinion: her tenderne&s;s, her purity, he &s;aid to him&s;elf, could not be feigned: no, &s;he was a trea&s;ure greater than he de&s;erved to po&s;&s;e&s;s; nor would he, like a wayward &s;on of error, fling away the happine&s;s he had &s;o long de&s;ired to obtain.</P>
<P>The calm this re&s;olution produced, was but tran&s;ient; doubts had been rai&s;ed, and doubts could not be ba|ni&s;hed; he was inclined to think them unju&s;t, yet had not power to di&s;pel them. Vainly he applied to the ideas which had heretofore been &s;uch con&s;olatory re|&s;ources of comfort to him, namely, that his father would con&s;ent to his union with Amanda, through the inter|ference of his aunt; and the felicity he &s;hould en|joy in that union, an unu&s;ual heavine&s;s clung to his heart, which like a gloomy &s;ky, ca&s;t a &s;hade of &s;adne&s;s over every pro&s;pect. Thoughtful and pen&s;ive he reached home, ju&s;t as Sir Charles Bingley was enter|ing the door who informed him he had ju&s;t received a note from Lord Cherbury, de&s;iring his immediate pre|&s;ence.</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer attended him to the Earl, who ac|quainted him that he had received a letter from Mr. Fitz|alan, in which he expre&s;&s;ed a warm &s;en&s;e of the honour Sir Charles did his family, by addre&s;&s;ing Mi&s;s Fitzalan; and that to have her united to a character &s;o truly e&s;|timable would give him the true&s;t happine&s;s, from the conviction that her's would be &s;ecured by &s;uch an union. "He has written to his daughter, expre&s;&s;ing his &s;en|timents," continued Lord Cherbury; " I have there|fore
<PB N="124" REF="038416_0317_1011E3C234C29B68">
no doubt, Sir Charles, but what every thing will &s;ucceed to your wi&s;h.</P>
<P>"I am &s;orry, my Lord," cried Sir Charles, with an agitated voice, and a cheek flu&s;hed with emotion, "that I ever troubled your Lord&s;hip in this affair, as I have now, and forever, relinqui&s;hed all ideas of an union with Mi&s;s Fitzalan."</P>
<P>"The re&s;olution is really &s;omewhat extraordinary and &s;udden," replied the Earl, "after the conver&s;ation which &s;o lately pa&s;&s;ed between us."</P>
<P>"Adopted, however, my Lord, from a thorough con|viction that happine&s;s could never be attained in an union with that young lady."&mdash;Sir Charles's tenderne&s;s for Amanda was &s;till undimini&s;hed: he wi&s;hed to pre&s;erve her from cen&s;ure, and thus proceeded:</P>
<P>"Your Lord&s;hip mu&s;t allow I could have little chance of happine&s;s in allying my&s;elf to a woman who has re|&s;olutely and uniformly treated me with indifference: pa&s;&s;ion blinded my rea&s;on, when I addre&s;&s;ed your Lord|&s;hip relative to Mi&s;s Fitzalan, but its mi&s;ts are now di&s;|per&s;ed, and &s;ober reflection obliges me to relinqui&s;h a &s;cheme, who&s;e accompli&s;hment could not po&s;&s;ibly give me &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>"You are certainly the be&s;t judge, of your own ac|tions, Sir Charles," replied the Earl; "my acting in the affair proceeded from a wi&s;h to &s;erve you, as well as from my friend&s;hip to Captain Fitzalan; I mu&s;t &s;up|po&s;e your conduct will never di&s;parage your own ho|nour, or ca&s;t a &s;light upon Mi&s;s Fitzalan."</P>
<P>"That, my Lord, you may be a&s;&s;ured of," &s;aid Sir Charles, with &s;ome warmth, "my actions and their mo|tives have hitherto and will ever, I tru&s;t, bear the &s;trict|e&s;t inve&s;tigation. I cannot retire without thanking your Lord&s;hip for the intere&s;t you took in my favour: had things &s;ucceeded as I then hoped and expected, I cannot deny but I &s;hould have been much happier than I am at pre&s;ent. He then bowed and retired.</P>
<P>Lor Mortimer had li&s;tened with a&s;toni&s;hment to Sir Charles's relinqui&s;hment of Amanda: like his father, he thought it a &s;udden and extraordinary re&s;olution:&mdash;he
<PB N="125" REF="038416_0318_1011E3C600D827F0">
was before jealous of Amanda's love&mdash;he was now jea|lous of her honour. The agitation of Sir Charles &s;eem|ed to imply even a cau&s;e more powerful than her cold|ne&s;s for re&s;igning her: he recollected that the Baronet and the Colonel were intimate friends: di&s;tracted by apprehen&s;ions, he ru&s;hed out of the hou&s;e, and over|took Sir Charles ere he had quitted the &s;quare.</P>
<P>"Why Bingley," cried he, with affected gaiety, "I thought you too valient a knight to be ea&s;ily overcome by de&s;pair; and that without fir&s;t trying every effort to win her fovour, you never would give up a fair lady you had &s;et your heart on."</P>
<P>"I leave &s;uch efforts for your Lord&s;hip," replied Sir Charles, "or tho&s;e who have equal patience."</P>
<P>"But &s;eriou&s;ly, Bingley, I think this &s;udden re&s;igna|tion of Mi&s;s Fitzalan &s;omewhat &s;trange: why, la&s;t night I could have &s;worn you were as much attached to her as ever. From Lord Cherbury's friend&s;hip for Captain Fitzalan, I think her, in &s;ome degree, under his pro|tection and mine; and as the particularity of your at|tentions attracted ob&s;ervation, I think your abruptly withdrawing them requires explanation."</P>
<P>"As Lord Cherbury was the per&s;on I applied to, re|lative to Mi&s;s Fitzalan," exclaimed Sir Charles, "and as he was &s;atisfied with the motive I a&s;&s;igned for my conduct, be a&s;&s;ured, my Lord, I &s;hall never give ano|ther to you."</P>
<P>"Your words," retorted Lord Mortimer with warmth, "imply that there was another motive for your con|duct, than the one you avowed: what horrid infer|ence may not be drawn from &s;uch an in&s;inuation? Oh, Sir Charles, reputation is a fragile flower, which the &s;lighte&s;t breath may injure."</P>
<P>"My Lord, if Mi&s;s Fitzalan's reputation is never in|jured but by my means, it will ever continue un&s;ullied."</P>
<P>"I cannot, indeed, re&s;umed Lord Mortimer, "&s;tile my&s;elf her guardian, but I con&s;ider my&s;elf her friend; and from the feelings of friend&s;hip, &s;hall ever evince my intere&s;t in her welfare, and re&s;ent any conduct which can po&s;&s;ibly render her an object of cen&s;ure to any being."</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="038416_0319_1011E3C7989810F8">
"Allow me to a&s;k your Lord&s;hip one que&s;tion," cried Sir Charles, "and promi&s;e, on your honour, to an&s;wer it."</P>
<P>"I do promi&s;e," &s;aid Lord Mortimer.</P>
<P>"Then, my Lord, Did you ever really wi&s;h I &s;hould &s;ucceed with Mi&s;s Fitzalan?"</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer coloured, "You expect, Sir Charles, I &s;hall an&s;wer you on my honour? Then really I never did."</P>
<P>"Your pa&s;&s;ions and mine," continued Sir Charles, "are impetuous; we had better check them in time, lea&s;t they lead us to lengths we may hereafter repent of. Of Mi&s;s Fitzalan's fame, be a&s;&s;ured, no man could be more tenacious than I &s;hould:&mdash;I love her with the true&s;t ardour:&mdash;her acceptance of my propo&s;als would have given me felicity:&mdash;my &s;uddenly withdrawing them, can never injure her, when I declare my motive for &s;o doing, was her indifference. Lord Cherbury is &s;atisfied with the rea&s;on I have a&s;&s;igned for re&s;igning her; he is con&s;cious that no man of &s;en&s;ibility could experience happine&s;s with a woman, in who&s;e heart he knew he had no intere&s;t: this, I &s;uppo&s;e, your Lord|&s;hip will al&s;o allow."</P>
<P>"Certainly," replied Lord Mortimer.</P>
<P>"Then it &s;trikes me, my Lord, that it is your con|duct, not mine, which has a tendency to injure Mi&s;s Fitzalan: that it is your words, not mine, which con|vey an in&s;inuation again&s;t her: you really appear if con|&s;cious &s;ome other cau&s;e exi&s;ted, which would have made me relinqui&s;h her, without the one I have alrea|dy a&s;&s;igned for doing &s;o."</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer was in&s;tantly convinced of the ju&s;tice of what Sir Charles &s;aid; he began to fear his warmth would really prove prejudicial to Amanda; betray the doubts which had obtruded on his mind, and communi|cate them to tho&s;e who might not be equally influenced by tenderne&s;s and delicacy to conceal them.</P>
<P>"You are right, Sir Charles," &s;aid he, "in what you have &s;aid, pa&s;&s;ion, like a bad advocate, hurts the cau&s;e in which it is engaged. From my knowledge of your
<PB N="127" REF="038416_0320_1011E3CA36E3E140">
character, I &s;hould have been convinced your honour would have prevented any improper conduct. You are going to Ireland; permit me, Sir Charles, to offer you my be&s;t wi&s;hes for your future happine&s;s."</P>
<P>Sir Charles took Lord Mortimer's extended hand:&mdash;he re&s;pected and e&s;teemed his Lord&s;hip, and a mutual interchange of good wi&s;hes took place between them, as this was the la&s;t interview they expected for a long time.</P>
<P>The indi&s;po&s;ition of Amanda was more of the men|tal than the bodily kind, and on the fir&s;t intimation of a party to the play, &s;he agreed to join it, in hopes the amu&s;ement would remove her dejection. Her father's letter, relative to Sir Charles Bingley, had given her &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s, but as he left her free to act, &s;he con|tented her&s;elf with u&s;ing the negative he allowed her, by a &s;olemn re&s;olution of never acting contrary to his inclinations, and an&s;wered his letter to this pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer and Freelove attended the ladies in the evening to the play. His Lord&s;hip found an oppor|tunity of tenderly inquiring after Amanda's health.&mdash;When they were &s;eated in the hou&s;e, he perceived a lady in another box, to whom he wi&s;hed to &s;peak, and accordingly left his party. This lady offered him a &s;eat by her&s;elf, which he accepted. She was a &s;tranger to Amanda, young, and extremely beautiful. Amanda, however, had none of that fooli&s;h weekne&s;s which could make her dread a rival in every new face, or feel unea&s;i|ne&s;s at Lord Mortimer's attention to any woman but her|&s;elf; a&s;&s;ured that his affections for her were founded on the ba&s;is of e&s;teem, and that &s;ha would retain them while worthy of e&s;teem; &s;he could, without being di&s;compo|&s;ed by the agreeable conver&s;ation he appeared enjoying, fix her attention on the &s;tage; &s;o entirely, indeed, that &s;he ob&s;erved not, from time to time the glances Lord Mortimer directed towards her:&mdash;not &s;o his fair compa|nion; &s;he noticed the wanderings of his eyes, and her own involuntarily pur&s;ued their cour&s;e. She was &s;peak|ing at the moment, but &s;uddenly &s;topt, and Lord Mor|timer
<PB N="128" REF="038416_0321_1011E3CBF33227C8">
&s;aw her change colour. He turned pale him&s;elf&punc; and in a faultering voice, a&s;ked her, "if &s;he knew the lady &s;he had been looking at?"</P>
<P>"Know her," replied &s;he, "oh heavens! but too well."</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer trembled univer&s;ally, and was com|pelled to have recour&s;e to his handkerchief, to hide his emotion.</P>
<P>It was by Adela, the lovely and neglected wife of Belgrave, he was &s;itting. She had been a &s;hort time in London, and her acquaintance with Lord Mortimer com|menced at a ball, where &s;he had danced with him. He was not one of tho&s;e kind of men who when in love have neither eyes or ears, but for the object of that love; he could &s;ee perfections in other women, be&s;ides his Aman|da, and was particularly plea&s;ed with Mrs. Belgrave. He in&s;tantly perceived &s;he knew Amanda; al&s;o, that that knowledge was attended with pain. The well known profligacy of her hu&s;band intruded on his memo|ry and he &s;huddered at the dreadful thoughts which ro&s;e in his mind.</P>
<P>Curio&s;ity had directed the eyes of Adela to Amanda, but admiration, and an idea of having &s;omewhere be|fore &s;een her face, rivetted them upon her; at la&s;t, the picture O&s;car Fitzalan had &s;hewn, occurred to her re|collection, and &s;he was immediately convinced it was no other than the original of that picture &s;he now &s;aw. Shocked at the &s;ight of a per&s;on, who, as &s;he thought had &s;tept (though innocently) between her and felicity; and di&s;tre&s;t by the emotions which pa&s;t &s;cenes thus re|called gave ri&s;e to, &s;he entreated Lord Mortimer to con|duct her from the box, that &s;he might return home.</P>
<P>He complied with her reque&s;t, but &s;topt in the lobby, and entreated her to tell him "where &s;he had known the lady &s;he had &s;o attentively regarded." Adela, blu&s;h|ed, and would, if po&s;&s;ible, have evaded the que&s;tion; but the earne&s;tne&s;s of his Lord&s;hip's manner, compelled her to an&s;wer it. She &s;aid "&s;he had no per&s;onal know|ledge of the lady, but recollected her face, from having &s;een her picture with a gentleman."</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="038416_0322_1011E3CD872F4390">
"And who was the gentleman," a&s;ked Lord Morti|mer, with a forced &s;mile, and a faltering voice.</P>
<P>"That," replied Adela, with involuntary quickne&s;s "I will not tell."</P>
<P>"I &s;hould apologize, indeed," cried Lord Morti|mer, recollecting him&s;elf, "for a curio&s;ity which may appear impertinent." He led her to a chair, and deli|berated whether he &s;hould not follow her example in quitting the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Malcolm had fir&s;t made him unea&s;y; unea&s;ine&s;s introduced doubts which Sir Charles Bingley had in|crea&s;ed, and Mrs. Belgrave almo&s;t confirmed. He dread|ed a horrid confirmation of his fears; the picture, like Othello's handkerchief, was a &s;ource of un&s;peakable an|gui&s;h. The agitation that Mrs. Belgrave had betray|ed, on mentioning it, joined to her concealment of the gentleman &s;he had &s;een it with, tempted him to believe, he was no other than her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Yet that he might not be accu&s;ed of yielding ra&s;hly to jealou&s;y, he re&s;olved to confine his &s;u&s;picions, like his pangs, to his own bo&s;om, except a&s;&s;ured they were well &s;ounded; a little time, he &s;uppo&s;ed, would determine the opinion he &s;hould form of Amanda. If he found &s;he en|couraged Belgrave, he re&s;olved to leave her without an explanation: if, on the contrary, he &s;aw that &s;he avoided him, he meant to mention the circum&s;tance of the pic|ture to her, yet &s;o as not to hurt her feelings, and be re|gulated by her an&s;wer, relative to his future conduct. He returned at la&s;t to the box, and procured a &s;eat behind her. He had not occupied it long, 'ere Colonel Bel|grave (who from a retired part of the hou&s;e, where he &s;at with &s;ome female friends, had ob&s;erved Amanda) entered the next box, and made his way to the pillar again&s;t which &s;he leaned. He endeavoured to catch her eyes but the noi&s;e he made on entering, put her on her guard, and &s;he in&s;tantly averted her face. Her em|barra&s;&s;ment was vi&s;ible to her party, and they all, Lord Mortimer excepted, enjoyed it; &s;carcely could he re|frain from cha&s;ti&s;ing the audacity of Belgrave's locks,
<PB N="130" REF="038416_0323_1011E3D31A2ADA40">
who &s;till continued to gaze on Amanda, though he could not &s;ee her face; nothing but the di&s;covery which &s;uch a &s;tep would produce, could have prevented his Lord&s;hip, in his pre&s;ent irritable &s;tate of mind, from cha&s;ti&s;ing what he deemed the height of in&s;olence.</P>
<P>At la&s;t the hour came for relieving Amanda from a &s;ituation extremely painful to her. As Lord Mortimer &s;at next the Marchione&s;s, he was compelled to offer her his hand. Freelove led Lady Euphra&s;ia; Lady Grey|&s;tock and Mi&s;s Malco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">m followed her, and Amanda was the la&s;t who quitted the box. A crowd in the lob|by impeded their progre&s;s. Amanda was clo&s;e behind the Marchione&s;s, when Belgrave forced his way to her, and attempted to take her hand at the very moment Lord Mortimer turned to look at her, who heard him &s;ay. "Dear, though unkind Amanda, why this cruel change in your conduct?"</P>
<P>The eyes of Mortimer fla&s;hed fire: "Mi&s;s Fitzalan," &s;aid he, in a voice trembling through pa&s;&s;ion, "if you accept my arm, I will make way for you, or at lea&s;t &s;e|cure you from impertinence." Amanda, though trem|bling and confounded by his looks, he&s;itated not to ac|cept his offer. Belgrave knew his words alluded to him; at pre&s;ent, however, he re&s;olved not to re&s;ent them, convinced, that if he did, his views on Amanda would be defeated. From that moment her beauty was not more powerful in &s;timulating his de&s;igns, than his de&s;ire of revenge on Lord Mortimer. He &s;aw he was fondly attached to Amanda, and he believed his proud heart would feel no event &s;o afflictive as that which &s;hould deprive him of her.</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer handed Amanda to the carriage; he was pre&s;t to return to &s;upper, but refu&s;ed. The ladies found the Marquis and Lord Cherbury together. Aman|da retired to her chamber immediately after &s;upper; the pre&s;ence of Belgrave had increa&s;ed the dejection which &s;he hoped the amu&s;ements of the theatre would have di&s;&s;ipated; &s;he now indeed longed for the period, when &s;he &s;hould be entitled to the protection of Lord Morti|mer: when &s;he &s;hould no longer dread the and city <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="131" REF="038416_0324_1011E3D4A6C942A0">
&s;tratagems of Belgrave. Lord Cherbury, on her retir|ing expre&s;t his regret at her coldne&s;s to Sir Charles Bingley, by which &s;he had lo&s;t a mo&s;t honourable and advantageous attachment.</P>
<P>This was an opportunity not to be neglected by the Marchione&s;s, for commencing her operations again&s;t Fitzalan. A glance to Lady Grey&s;tock was the &s;ignal to begin.</P>
<P>"To tho&s;e," &s;aid Lady Grey&s;tock, "who are igno|rant of Mi&s;s Fitzalan's real motives for refu&s;ing Sir Charles, it mu&s;t appear, no doubt, extraordinary; but ambitious people are not ea&s;ily &s;atisfied; indeed I cannot blame her &s;o much, for entertaining a&s;piring notions, as tho&s;e who in&s;tilled them into her mind."</P>
<P>Lord Cherbury &s;tared, and reque&s;ted an explanation of her words.</P>
<P>"Why I declare, my Lord," cried &s;he, "I do not know but that it will be more friendly to explain than conceal my meaning; when once informed of the young lady's views, your lord&s;hip may be able to convince her of their fallacy, and prevail on her not to lo&s;e another good opportunity of &s;ettling her&s;elf in con&s;equence of them; in &s;hort, my Lord, Mi&s;s Fitzalan, prompted by her father, has ca&s;t her eyes on Lord Mortimer; pre|&s;uming on your friend&s;hip, he thought an union between them might ea&s;ily be accompli&s;hed. I do not believe Lord Mortimer, at fir&s;t, gave any encouragement to their de&s;igns: but when the girl was continually thrown in his way, it was impo&s;&s;ible not to notice her at la&s;t. I really expre&s;t a thorough di&s;approbation to her con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing to London, knowing their motives for de&s;iring the ex|cur&s;ion, but her father never cea&s;ed per&s;ecuting me, till I con&s;ented to take her under my protection."</P>
<P>"Upon my word," cried the Marquis, who was not of the ladies privy council, though if he had, it is proba|ble he would not have objected to their &s;chemes, "Cap|tain Fitzalan mu&s;t have had &s;ome &s;uch motive, as this Lady Grey&s;tock has mentioned, for &s;ending his daugh|ter to London, or el&s;e he would not have been &s;o ridicu|lous
<PB N="132" REF="038416_0325_1011E3D78AAE7B58">
as to put him&s;elf to the expence of &s;itting her out, for company &s;he has no right to enter."</P>
<P>"I never thought," exclaimed Lord Cherbury, who&s;e mind was irritated to the mo&s;t violent degree of re&s;ent|ment again&s;t his injured friend, "that Captain Fitzalan could have acted with &s;uch duplicity. He knew the views I entertained for my &s;on, and there is a mean treachery in his attempting to counteract them.</P>
<P>"Nay, my Lord," &s;aid Lady Grey&s;tock, "you are a father your&s;elf, and mu&s;t make allowances for the anxi|ety of a parent to e&s;tabli&s;h a child."</P>
<P>"No madam," he replied, " I can make no allow|ance for a deviation from integrity, or for a &s;acrifice of honour and gratitude at the &s;hrine of intere&s;t: the &s;ubject has di&s;compo&s;ed me, and I mu&s;t beg to be ex|cu&s;ed for abruptly retiring: nothing, indeed, I believe, can wound one &s;o &s;everely as deceit, where one repo&s;ed implicit confidence."</P>
<P>The ladies were enraptured at the &s;ucce&s;s of their &s;cheme. The pa&s;&s;ion of Lord Cherbury could &s;carcely be &s;mothered in their pre&s;ence. On the head of Fitza|lan they knew it would bur&s;t with full violence. They did not mention Belgrave; relative to him they re&s;olved to affect profound ignorance.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ions of Lord Cherbury were impetuous. He had, as I have already hinted, &s;ecret motives for de&s;iring a connexion between his family and the Marquis's; and the idea of that de&s;ire being defeated, drove him almo&s;t to di&s;traction. He knew his &s;on's pa&s;&s;ions, though not &s;o ea&s;ily irritated as his own, were, when once irritated, equally violent. To remon&s;trate with him concerning Mi&s;s Fitzalan, he believed would be unavailing; he therefore re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to have her removed out of his way, ere he appri&s;ed him of the di&s;covery he had made of his attachment. He entertained not a doubt of Lady Grey&s;tock's veracity; from his general know|ledge of mankind, he believed &s;elf the predominant con|&s;ideration in every brea&s;t. His feelings were too vio|lent not to &s;eek an immediate vent, and ere he went to bed, he wrote a bitter and reproachful letter to Fitzalan,
<PB N="133" REF="038416_0326_1011E3D918B220D8">
which concluded with an intreaty, or rather a command, to &s;end, without delay, for his daughter. A dreadful &s;troke this for poor Fitzalan.
<Q><L>After all his wanderings round this world of care,</L>
<L>And all his griefs&mdash;</L></Q>
He hoped he had at la&s;t found a &s;pot, where his latter days might clo&s;e in tranquillity.</P>
<P>The innocent Amanda was received the next morning with &s;miles, by tho&s;e who were preparing a plot for her de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t at breakfa&s;t, a &s;ervant informed Lady Grey|&s;tock a young woman wanted to &s;peak to her.</P>
<P>"Who is &s;he?" a&s;ked her Lady&s;hip, "Did &s;he not &s;end up her name?"</P>
<P>"No, my Lady, but &s;he &s;aid &s;he had particular bu&s;i|ne&s;s with your Lady&s;hip."</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s directed &s;he might be &s;hewed up, and a girl about &s;eventeen was accordingly u&s;hered into the room. Her figure was delicate, and her face inter|e&s;ting, not only from its innocence, but the &s;trong ex|pre&s;&s;ion of melancholy diffu&s;ed over it. She appeared trembling with confu&s;ion and timidity, and the poverty of her apparel implied the &s;ource of her dejection.</P>
<P>"So, child," &s;aid Lady Grey&s;tock, after &s;urveying her from head to foot, "I am told you have bu&s;ine&s;s with me,"</P>
<P>"Yes, Madam," replied &s;he, in an accent &s;o low as &s;carcely to be heard, "my father, Captain Ru&s;hbrook, de&s;ired me to deliver a letter to your lady&s;hip."</P>
<P>She pre&s;ented it, and endeavoured to &s;creen her&s;elf from the &s;crutinizing and contemptuous glances of lady Euphra&s;ia by pulling her hat more over her face.</P>
<P>"I wonder, child," &s;aid Lady Grey&s;tock, as &s;he open|ed the letter, "what your father can write to me about? I dont &s;uppo&s;e it can be about the affair he mentioned the other day?&mdash;Why really," continued &s;he, after &s;he had peru&s;ed it, " I believe he takes me for a fool; I am a&s;toni&s;hed, after his in&s;olent conduct, how he can po&s;&s;i|bly

have the a&s;&s;urance to make application to me for re|lief: no, no, child, he neglected the opportunity he had of &s;ecuring me his friend; it would really be a &s;in to give him the power of bringing up his family in idle|ne&s;s; no, no, child, he mu&s;t learn you, and the other little dainty mi&s;&s;es he has, to do &s;omething for your|&s;elves."</P>
<P>The poor girl blu&s;hed: a tear trembled in her eye; &s;he tried to &s;uppre&s;s it, but it forced its way, and dropt into her bo&s;om. Amanda, inexpre&s;&s;ibly &s;hocked, could &s;upport the &s;cene no longer; &s;he retired precipitately, and de&s;cended to the parlour; &s;ympathy as well as com|pa&s;&s;ion made her feel for this daughter of affliction, for &s;he her&s;elf knew what it was to feel the in&s;olence of pro&s;perity, " the proud man's &s;corn, and all tho&s;e ills which patient merit of the unworthy takes."</P>
<P>In a few minutes Mi&s;s Ru&s;hbrook quitted the draw|ing room, and &s;topt in the hall to wipe away her tears. Amanda had been watching for her, and now appeared: &s;he &s;tarted, and was hurrying away, when Amanda caught her hand, and leading her &s;oftly to the parlour, endeavoured, with angelic &s;weetne&s;s, to calm her emo|tion. Surpri&s;ed at this unexpected attention, and over come by her feelings, the poor girl &s;unk on her chair, and dropping her head on Amanda's bo&s;on, wet it with a &s;hower of tears, as &s;he exclaimed, " Alas! my unfor|tunate parents, how can I return to behold your mi&s;ery? the grave is the only refuge for you and your wretched children."</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t not encourage &s;uch de&s;ponding thoughts," &s;aid Amanda, "Providence, all bounteous and all pow|erful, is able, in a &s;hort time, to change the gloomie&s;t &s;cene into one of brightne&s;s. Tell me," &s;he continued, after a pau&s;e, "where do you re&s;ide?"</P>
<P>"At Ken&s;ington."</P>
<P>"Ken&s;ington," repeated Amanda, "&s;urely, in your pre&s;ent &s;ituation, you are unable to take &s;uch a walk."</P>
<P>"I mu&s;t attempt it, however," replied Mi&s;s Ru&s;h|brock.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="038416_0328_1011E3DF0F0DD220">
Amanda walked from her to the window, revolving a &s;cheme which had ju&s;t darted into her mind; "If you knew any hou&s;e, "&s;aid &s;he, "where you could &s;tay for a &s;hort time, I would call on you in a carriage and leave you at home."</P>
<P>This offer was truly plea&s;ing to the poor weak trem|bling girl, but &s;he mode&s;tly declined it, from the fear of giving trouble. Amanda be&s;ought her not to wa&s;te time in &s;uch unnece&s;&s;ary &s;cruples, but to give her the de&s;ired information.</P>
<P>She accordingly informed her there was a Haberda&s;h|er's in Bond &s;treet, mentioning the name, where &s;he could &s;tay till called for.</P>
<P>This point &s;ettled, Amanda, fearful of being &s;urpri&s;ed, conducted her &s;oftly to the hall-door, and immediately returned to the drawing-room, where &s;he found La|dy Euphra&s;ia ju&s;t beginning to read Ru&s;hbrook's letter, for her mother's amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>Its &s;tile evidently denoted the painful conflicts there were between pride and di&s;tre&s;s, ere the former could be &s;ufficiently &s;ubdued, to allow an application for relief to the per&s;on who had occa&s;ioned the latter; the &s;ight of a tender and beloved wife langui&s;hing in the arms of &s;ickne&s;s, &s;urrounded by a family, under the pre&s;&s;ure of the &s;evere&s;t want, had forced him to a &s;tep, which, on his own account, no nece&s;&s;ity could have compelled him to take. He and his family, he &s;aid, had drank the cup of mi&s;ery to the very dregs: he waved the claims of ju&s;tice, he only a&s;&s;erted tho&s;e of humani|ty, in his pre&s;ent application to her Lady&s;hip; and the&s;e, he flattered him&s;elf, &s;he would allow: he had &s;ent a young petitioner in his behalf, who&s;e tearful eye, who&s;e faded cheek, were &s;ad evidences of the mi&s;ery he de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s declared &s;he was a&s;toni&s;hed at his in&s;olence in making &s;uch an application, and Lady Eu|phra&s;ia prote&s;ted it was the mo&s;t ridiculous &s;tuff &s;he had ever read.</P>
<P>Amanda, in this, as well as many other in&s;tances, dif|fered from her L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">dy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ip; but her opinion, like a little

<P>Out of the allowance her father made her for cloathes and other expences, about ten guineas remained, which &s;he had intended laying out in the purcha&s;e of &s;ome or|naments for her appearance at a ball, to be given in the cour&s;e of the en&s;uing week, by the Dutche&s;s of B&mdash;, and for which, at the time of invitation, Lord Morti|mer had engaged her for his partner, to give up going to this ball, to con&s;ecrate to charity the money devo|ted to vanity, was her project; and mo&s;t fortunate did &s;he deem the application of Ru&s;hbrook, ere her purcha&s;e was made, and &s;he con&s;equently prevented from giving her mite. Her &s;oul revolted from the inhumanity of the Marchione&s;s, her daughter and Lady Grey&s;tock. Exempt from the calamities of want them&s;elves, they forgot the pity due to tho&s;e calamities in others; if this coldne&s;s, this obduracy, &s;he cried within her&s;elf, is the effect of pro&s;perity: if thus it clo&s;es the avenues of be|nevolence and compa&s;&s;ion, oh! never may the dangerous vi&s;itor approach me, for ill &s;hould I think the glow of compa&s;&s;ion and &s;en&s;ibility exchanged for all its gaudy plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>The ladies had mentioned their intention of going to an auction, where, to u&s;e Lady Euphra&s;ia's phra&s;e, "they expected to &s;ee all the world." Amanda excu&s;ed her&s;elf from being of the party, &s;aying, &s;he wanted to make &s;ome purcha&s;es in the city. Her excu&s;e was rea|dily admitted, and when they retired to their re&s;pective toilets, &s;he &s;ent for a carriage, and being prepared a|gain&s;t it came, immediately &s;tept into it, and was driven to Bond &s;treet, where &s;he found Mi&s;s Ru&s;hbrook with trembling anxiety waiting her arrival.</P>
<P>In their way to Ken&s;ington, the tenderne&s;s of Aman|da at once conciliated the affection, and gained the en|tire confidence of her young companion. She related the little hi&s;tory of her parents' &s;orrows. Her father, on returning from America, with his wife and &s;ix chil|dren, had been advi&s;ed by Mr. Heathfield, the friend who had effected a reconciliation between him and his
<PB N="137" REF="038416_0330_1011E3E3E3217438">
uncle, to commence a &s;uit again&s;t Lady Grey&s;tock, on the pre&s;umption that the will, by which &s;he enjoyed Sir Geoffry's fortune, was illegally executed. He offered him his pur&s;e to carry on the &s;uit, and his hou&s;e for an habitation. Ru&s;hbrook gratefully and gladly accepted both offers, and having di&s;po&s;ed of his commi&s;&s;ion, to di&s;charge &s;ome pre&s;ent demands again&s;t him, he and his family took up their re&s;idence under Mr. Heathfield's ho&s;pitable roof. In the mid&s;t of the felicity enjoyed beneath it; in the mid&s;t of the hopes their own &s;an|guine tempers, and the flattering &s;ugge&s;tions of the lawyers had excited, a violent fever carried off their be|benevolent friend, 'ere a will was executed, in which he had promi&s;ed largely to con&s;ider Ru&s;hbrook. His heir, narrow and illiberal, had long feared that his intere&s;t would be hurt by the affection he entertained for Ru&s;h|brook: and as if in revenge for the pain this fear had given, the moment he had the power he &s;hewed his ma|lignant di&s;po&s;ition, &s;old all the furniture of the hou&s;e at Ken&s;ington, and, as a great favour, told Ru&s;hbrook he might continue in it till the expiration of the half year, when it was to be given up to the landlord. The law|yers under&s;tanding the &s;tate of his finances, &s;oon inform|ed him he could no longer expect their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.&mdash;Thus, almo&s;t in one moment, did all his plea&s;ing pro&s;|pects vani&s;h, and,
<Q>Like the ba&s;ele&s;s fabric of a vi&s;ion, left not a wreck behind.</Q></P>
<P>As a duty he owed his family, he tried whether Lady Grey&s;tock would make a compromi&s;e between ju&s;tice and avarice, and afford him &s;ome means of &s;upport. Her in&s;olence and inhumanity &s;hocked him to the &s;oul; and as he left her pre&s;ence, he re&s;olved never to enter it again, or apply to her: this la&s;t re&s;olution, however, on|ly continued till the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of his family grew &s;o great as to threaten their exi&s;tence, perticularly that of his wife's who, overpowered by grief, had &s;unk into a langui&s;hing illne&s;s, which every day increa&s;ed for want of proper a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="038416_0331_1011E3E6A3C8E380">
In hopes of procuring her &s;ome, he was tempted again to apply to Lady Grey&s;tock. The youth and innocence of his daughter, would, he thought, if any thing could do it, &s;often her flinty heart: be&s;ides, he believed that plea&s;ure, at finding his pretentions to the fortune entire|ly withdrawn, would influence her to admini&s;ter from it to his wants.</P>
<P>"We have," &s;aid Mi&s;s Ru&s;hbrook, as &s;he concluded her &s;imple narration, "tried, and been di&s;appointed in our la&s;t re&s;ource: what will become of us I know not; we have long been &s;trangers to the comforts, but even the nece&s;&s;aries of life we cannot now procure."</P>
<P>"Comfort," cried Amanda, "often arrives when lea&s;t expected: to de&s;pair, into doubt the goodne&s;s of a Being, who has promi&s;ed to protect all his creatures."</P>
<P>The carriage had now reached Ken&s;ington, and with|in a few yards of Ru&s;hbrook's habitation. Amanda &s;topt it; &s;he took Mi&s;s Ru&s;hbrook's hand, and as &s;he &s;lipt a ten pound note into it, exclaimed, " I tru&s;t the period is not far di&s;tant, when the friend&s;hip we have conceived for each other, may be cultivated under more fortunate au&s;pices."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Ru&s;hbrook opened the folded paper: &s;he &s;tarted, and " the hectic of a moment flu&s;hed her cheek."&mdash;"Oh! Madam," &s;he cried, "your goodne&s;s&mdash;" tears impeded her further utterance.</P>
<P>"Do not di&s;tre&s;s me," &s;aid Amanda, again taking her hand, "by mentioning &s;uch a trifle; was my abili|ty equal to my inclination I &s;hould blu&s;h to offer it to your acceptance: as it is, con&s;ider it but as the fore|ta&s;te of the bounty which heaven has, I doubt not, in &s;tore for you."</P>
<P>She then de&s;ired the door to be opened, and told her companion &s;he would no longer detain her. Mi&s;s Ru&s;h|brook affectionately ki&s;&s;ed her hand, and exclaimed, "You look like an angel, and your goodne&s;s is corre&s;|pondent to your looks. I will not, madam refu&s;e your bounty, I accept it with gratitude, for tho&s;e dearer to me than my&s;elf: but ah! may I not indulge a hope of
<PB N="139" REF="038416_0332_1011E3E9457C7310">
&s;eeing you again: you are &s;o kind, &s;o gentle, madam, that every care is lulled into forgetfulne&s;s whil&s;t conver|&s;ing with you."</P>
<P>"I &s;hall certainly &s;ee you again as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible," replied Amanda.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Ru&s;hbrook then quitted the carriage, which Amanda ordered back to town, and bid the coachman drive as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible. They had not proceeded far, when the traces &s;uddenly gave way; and the man was obliged to di&s;mount, and procure a&s;&s;i&s;tance from a pub|lic hou&s;e on the road, in repairing them. This occa&s;i|oned a delay, which greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Amanda. &s;he wi&s;hed greatly to get home before the ladies, le&s;t, if this was not the ca&s;e, her long ab&s;ence &s;hould make lady Grey&s;tock, who was remarkably inqui&s;itive, inquire the rea&s;on of it; and to tell her &s;he had a &s;trong objection, convinced as &s;he was, that her Lady&s;hip's knowing &s;he relieved objects &s;o extremely di&s;agreeable to her, would occa&s;ion a quarrel between them, which would either render a longer re&s;idence together impo&s;&s;ible, or highly di&s;agreeable; and to leave London at the pre&s;ent cri|&s;is, when every thing relative to Lord Mortimer was drawing to a conclu&s;ion, was not to be thought of without the greate&s;t pain.</P>
<P>At length the coachman remounted his box, and the velocity with which he drove, flattered her with the hope of reaching home as &s;oon as &s;he wi&s;hed. Tranquilized by this hope, &s;he again indulged her imagination with ideas of the comfort her little bounty had probably giv|en Ru&s;hbrook and his dejected family; &s;o &s;weet to her &s;oul was the &s;ecret approbation which crowned her cha|rity; &s;o preferable to any plea&s;ure &s;he could have expe|rienced at a ball, that even the di&s;appointment &s;he be|lieved Lord Mortimer would feel from her declining it, was overlooked in the &s;atisfaction &s;he felt from the action &s;he performed. She was convinced he would inquire her rea&s;on for not going, which &s;he determined at pre|&s;ent to conceal; it would appear like o&s;tentation, &s;he thought, to &s;ay, that the money requi&s;ite for her appear|ing at the ball, was expended in charity, and perhaps
<PB N="140" REF="038416_0333_1011E3EBD8F54070">
excite his genero&s;ity, in a manner which delicacy at pre&s;ent forbid her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">owing.</P>
<P>She a&s;ked the footman who handed her from the car|riage, whether the ladies were returned; and on being an&s;wered in the affirmative, inquired the hour, and learned it was ju&s;t dinner time. Flurried by this intelli|gence, &s;he ha&s;tened to her chamber, followed by the maid appointed to attend her, who &s;aid Lady Grey&s;tock had enquired for her as &s;oon as &s;he came home. Amanda dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf with unu&s;ual expedition, and repaired to the drawing room, where, in addition to the family party, &s;he found Lord Mortimer, Freelove, Mi&s;s Mal|colm, and &s;ome other ladies and gentlemen, a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P>"Ble&s;s me, child," &s;aid Lady Grey&s;tock, the mo|ment &s;he entered the room, " where have you been the whole day?"</P>
<P>"I declar, Mi&s;s Fitzalan," exclaimed Lady Euphra|&s;ia, "I believe you &s;tole a march &s;omewhere upon us this morning."</P>
<P>"Well," cried Mi&s;s Malcolm, laughing, "your La|dy&s;hip mu&s;t know that people generally have &s;ome im|portant rea&s;on for &s;tolen marches, which they do not chu&s;e to divulge."</P>
<P>Amanda treated this malicious in&s;inuation with the &s;ilent contempt it merited; and on Lady Grey&s;tock's again a&s;king her where &s;he had been, &s;aid, in a low he&s;itating voice, "In the city."</P>
<P>"In the city?" repeated Lord Mortimer.</P>
<P>This &s;udden exclamation &s;tartled her: &s;he looked at him, and perceived him regarding her with the mo&s;t &s;crutinizing earne&s;tne&s;s. She blu&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed deeply, as if de|tected in a fal&s;hood, and immediately bent her eyes to the ground.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation now changed, but it was &s;ome time ere Amanda's confu&s;ion &s;ub&s;ided.</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer, indeed, had a rea&s;on for his excla|mation, &s;he little thought of. He had met the Mar|chione&s;s and her companions, by appointment, at the auction, but &s;oon grew weary of his &s;ituation, which the pre&s;ence of Amanda could alone have rendered tolera|ble.
<PB N="141" REF="038416_0334_1011E3EE74133CE0">
He pleaded bu&s;ine&s;s as an excu&s;e for withdrawing, and hurrying home, ordered his phaeton, and proceeded towards Ken&s;ington. As he pa&s;t the carriage in which Amanda &s;at, at the time the traces were mending, he carele&s;sly looked into it, and directly recognized her. Lady Euphra&s;ia had informed him &s;he excu&s;ed her&s;elf from their party on account of &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s in the city. He never heard of her having any acquaintance in or about Ken&s;ington, and was at once alarmed and &s;urpri&s;ed by di&s;covering her. He drove to &s;ome di&s;tance from the carriage and as &s;oon as it began to move, pur&s;ued it with equal velocity, till it reached town, and then giv|ing his phaeton in charge to the &s;ervant, followed it on foot, till he &s;aw Amanda alight from it at the Marquis of Ro&s;line's. Amanda had e&s;caped &s;eeing his Lord&s;hip, by a profound meditation in which &s;he was engaged at the moment, as &s;he pen&s;ively leaned again&s;t the &s;ide of the carriage. Lord Mortimer walked back with in|crea&s;ed di&s;order to meet his phaeton. As he approached it, he &s;aw Colonel Belgrave by it, on hor&s;eback, admi|ring the hor&s;es, which were remarkably fine, and a&s;king to whom they belonged. His acquaintance with the Colonel had hitherto never exceeded more than a pa&s;&s;ing bow; now prompted by an irre&s;i&s;tible impul&s;e, he &s;alu|ted him familiarly; inquired, "Whether he had had a plea&s;ant ride that morning, and how far he had been."</P>
<P>"No farther than Ken&s;ington," replied the Colo|nel.</P>
<P>This an&s;wer was confirmation &s;trong to all the fears of Lord Mortimer; he turned pale, dropt the reins which he had taken, with an intention of remounting, and without even noticing the Colonel, &s;lew from the place, and arrived at home in almo&s;t a &s;tate of di&s;trac|tion. He was engaged to dine at the Marquis's, but in the fir&s;t violence of his feelings, re&s;olved on &s;ending an apology. Ere the &s;ervant, however, &s;ummoned for that purpo&s;e, had entered his apartment, he changed his re|&s;olution. "I will go," &s;aid he, "though appearances are again&s;t her, &s;he may perhaps (and he tried to derive
<PB N="142" REF="038416_0335_1011E3F12773E250">
&s;ome comfort from the idea) be able &s;atisfactorily to account for her being at Ken&s;ington."</P>
<P>Tortured by conflicting pa&s;&s;ions, alternately hoping and doubting, he arrived in Portman Square.</P>
<P>Lady Grey&s;tock and Lady Euphra&s;ia dwelt with won|der on the length of Amanda's morning excur&s;ion. When &s;he entered the room, he thought &s;he appeared embarra&s;&s;ed; and that on Lady Grey&s;tock's addre&s;&s;ing her, this embarra&s;&s;ment increa&s;ed: but when &s;he &s;aid &s;he had been in the city, her duplicity, as he termed it, appeared &s;o mon&s;trous to him, that he could not forbear an involuntary repetition of her words; &s;o great indeed, was the indignation it excited in his brea&s;t, that he could &s;carcely forbear reproaching her, as the de&s;troyer of his, and her own felicity. Her blu&s;h appeared to him, not the ingenuous colouring of innocence, but the glow of &s;hame and guilt. It was evident to him that &s;he had &s;een Belgrave that morning; that he was the occa&s;ion of all the my&s;tery which appeared in her conduct, and that it was the knowledge of the improper influence he had over her heart, which made Sir Charles Bingley &s;o &s;uddenly re&s;ign her.</P>
<P>Gracious heaven! &s;aid he to him&s;elf, who, that look|ed upon Amanda, could ever &s;uppo&s;e duplicity harbour|ed in her brea&s;t; yet that too &s;urely it is, I have every rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e; yet a little longer I will bear this tor|menting &s;u&s;pence, nor reveal my doubts, till thorough|ly convinced they are well founded.</P>
<P>He &s;at oppo&s;ite to her at dinner, and his eyes were di|rected towards her with that tender &s;adne&s;s which we feel on viewing a beloved object we know our&s;elves on the point of lo&s;ing forever.</P>
<P>His melancholy was quickly perceived by the penetra|ting Marchione&s;s and Lady Euphra&s;ia; they &s;aw with delight that the poi&s;on of &s;u&s;picion infu&s;ed into his mind, was already beginning to operate; they anticipa|ted the &s;ucce&s;s of all their &s;chemes; their &s;pirits grew uncommonly elevated, and Lady Euphra&s;ia determined, whenever &s;he had the power, to revenge on the &s;u&s;cep|tible nature of Mortimer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the unea&s;ine&s;s he had made
<PB N="143" REF="038416_0336_1011E3F37A8EEBC8">
her &s;uffer, and to add, as far as malice could add to it, to the mi&s;ery about to be the lot of Amanda.</P>
<P>The dejection of Lord Mortimer was al&s;o ob&s;erved by Amanda; it excited her fears and affected her &s;en&s;ibili|ty; &s;he dreaded that his aunt had refu&s;ed complying with his reque&s;t relative to her interference with his fa|ther, or that the Earl had been urging him to an imme|diate union with Lady Euphra&s;ia: perhaps her now wa|vered between love and duty; the thought &s;truck a cold damp upon her heart&mdash;yet no, cried &s;he, it cannot be; if inclined to change, Lord Mortimer would at once have informed me.</P>
<P>In the evening there was a large addition to the party, but Lord Mortimer &s;at pen&s;ively apart from the compa|ny. Amanda by chance procured a &s;eat next his. His palene&s;s alarmed her, and &s;he could not forbear hinting her fears that he was ill.</P>
<P>"I am ill indeed," &s;ighed he heavily:&mdash;he looked at her as he &s;poke, and beheld her regarding him with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite tenderne&s;s: but the period was pa&s;t for receiving delight from &s;uch an appearance of affection; an affection he had rea&s;on to believe was never more than feigned for him; and al&s;o from his emotions when with her, that he &s;hould never cea&s;e regretting the deception: his pa&s;&s;ions, exhau&s;ted by their own violence, had &s;unk into a calm, and &s;adne&s;s was the predominant feeling of his &s;oul. Though he &s;o bitterly lamented, he could not at the moment have reproached her perfidy: he gazed on her with mournful tenderne&s;s, and to the involuntary expre&s;&s;ion of regret which dropt from her, on hearing he was ill, only replied, by &s;aying, "Ah! Amanda, the man that really excites your tenderne&s;s, mu&s;t be happy."</P>
<P>Amanda, uncon&s;cious that any &s;ini&s;ter meaning lurk|ed beneath the&s;e words, con&s;idered them as an acknow|ledgment of the happine&s;s he him&s;elf experienced, from being convinced of her regard; and her heart &s;welled with plea&s;ure at the idea.</P>
<P>Any farther conver&s;ation between them was interrupt|ed by Mi&s;s Malcolm, who, in a laughing manner, &s;eat|ed

<P>FROM that evening, to the day de&s;tined for the ball, nothing material happened. On the morning of that day, as Amanda was &s;itting in the drawing room with the ladies, Lord Mortimer entered. Lady Euphra|&s;ia could talk of nothing el&s;e but the approaching enter|tainment, which &s;he &s;aid was expected to be the mo&s;t brilliant thing that had been given that winter.</P>
<P>"I hope your Lady&s;hip," &s;aid Amanda, who had not yet declared her intention of &s;taying at home, "will be able to give me a good de&s;cription of it."</P>
<P>"Why, I &s;uppo&s;e," cried Lady Euphra&s;ia, "you do not intend going without being able to &s;ee and hear your&s;elf."</P>
<P>"Certainly," replied Amanda, "I &s;hould not, but I do not intend going."</P>
<P>"Not go to the ball to night?" exclaimed Lady Eu|phra&s;ia.</P>
<P>"Ble&s;s me, child," &s;aid Lady Grey&s;tock, "what whim has entered your head to prevent your going?"</P>
<P>"Dear Lady Grey&s;tock," &s;aid Lady Euphra&s;ia, in a tone of unu&s;ual good humour, internally delighted at Amanda's re&s;olution, "don't teize Mi&s;s Fitzalan with que&s;tions."</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="038416_0338_1011E3F9F185B048">
"And you really do not go?" exclaimed Lord Mor|timer, in an accent expre&s;&s;ive of &s;urpri&s;e and di&s;ap|pointment.</P>
<P>"I really do not, my Lord."</P>
<P>"I declare," &s;aid the Marchione&s;s, even more de|lighted than her daughter at Amanda's re&s;olution, as it favoured a &s;cheme &s;he had long been projecting, "I wi&s;h Euphra&s;ia was as indifferent about amu&s;ement as Mi&s;s Fitzalan: here &s;he has been complaining of indi&s;|po&s;ition the whole morning, yet I cannot prevail on her to give up the ball."</P>
<P>Lady Eupha&s;ia, who never felt in better health and &s;pirits, would have contradicted the Marchione&s;s, had not an expre&s;&s;ive glance a&s;&s;ured her there was an im|portant motive for this a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>"May we not hope, Mi&s;s Fitzalan, &s;aid Lord Mor|timer, "that a re&s;olution &s;o &s;uddenly adopted as yours, may be as &s;uddenly changed?"</P>
<P>"No, indeed, my Lord, nor is it &s;o &s;uddenly form|ed as you &s;eem to &s;uppo&s;e."</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer &s;huddered, as he endeavoured to ac|count for it in his own mind; his agony became almo&s;t in&s;upportable: he aro&s;e and walked to the window where &s;he &s;at.</P>
<P>"Amanda," &s;aid he, in a low voice, "I fear you forgot your engagement to me."</P>
<P>Amanda, &s;uppo&s;ing this alluded to her engagement for the ball, replied, "&s;he had not forgotten it."</P>
<P>"For your inability, or di&s;inclination to fulfil it, then," &s;aid he, " will you not account?"</P>
<P>"Mo&s;t willingly, my Lord."</P>
<P>"When?" a&s;ked Lord Mortimer, impatiently, for unable longer to &s;upport his torturing &s;u&s;pence, he de|termined, contrary to his fir&s;t intention, to come to an immediate explanation relative to Belgrave.</P>
<P>"To morrow, my Lord," replied Amanda, "&s;ince you de&s;ire it, I will account for not keeping my en|gagement, and I tru&s;t," a mode&s;t blu&s;h mantling her
<PB N="146" REF="038416_0339_1011E3FC77CA12F0">
cheeks as &s;he &s;poke, "that your Lord&s;hip will not di&s;|approve of my rea&s;ons for declining it."</P>
<P>The peculiar earne&s;tne&s;s of his words, Lord Morti|mer imagined, had conveyed their real meaning to Amanda.</P>
<P>"Till to-morrow, then," &s;ighed he heavily, "I mu&s;t bear my di&s;quietude."</P>
<P>His regret, Amanda &s;uppo&s;ed, proceeded from di&s;|appointment at not having her company at the ball; &s;he was flattered by it, and plea&s;ed at the idea of telling him her real motive for not going; certain it would meet his approbation, and open another &s;ource of be|nevolence to poor Ru&s;hbrook.</P>
<P>In the evening, at Lady Euphra&s;ia's particular re|que&s;t, &s;he attended at her toilet, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in orna|menting her Lady&s;hip. At ten &s;he &s;aw the party de|part, without the &s;malle&s;t regret for not accompanying them: happy in &s;elf approbation, a delightful calm was diffu&s;ed over her mind: a treacherous calm, in|deed, which lulling her &s;en&s;es into &s;ecurity, made the approaching &s;torm bur&s;t with redoubled violence on her head; it was &s;uch a calm as Shake&s;peare beautiful|ly de&s;cribes:
<Q><L>We often &s;ee again&s;t &s;ome &s;torm</L>
<L>A &s;ilence in the heavens; the wreck &s;tands &s;till,</L>
<L>The bold winds &s;peechle&s;s, and the orb below</L>
<L>As hu&s;h as death.</L></Q></P>
<P>She continued in Lady Euphra&s;ia's dre&s;&s;ing room, and took up the beautiful and affecting &s;tory of Paul and Mary, to amu&s;e her&s;elf. Her whole attention was &s;oon engro&s;&s;ed by it, and with the unfortunate Paul &s;he was &s;hedding a deluge of tears over the fate of his love|ly Mary, when a &s;udden noi&s;e made her ha&s;tily turn her head, and with equal horror and &s;urpri&s;e, &s;he beheld Colonel Belgrave coming forward. She &s;tarted up and was &s;pringing to the door, when ru&s;hing between her and it he caught her in his arms, and forcing her back to the &s;ofa, rudely &s;topt her mouth.</P>
<P>"Neither cries nor &s;truggles, Amanda," &s;aid he,
<PB N="147" REF="038416_0340_1011E3FE09C7E800">
"will be availing; without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a friend, you may be convinced, I could not have entered this hou&s;e; and the &s;ame friend will, you may depend on it, take care that our tete-a-tete is not interrupted."</P>
<P>Amanda &s;huddered at the idea of treachery, and be|ing convinced, from what he &s;aid &s;he could not expect a&s;&s;i&s;tance, endeavoured to recover her fainting &s;pirits and exert all her re&s;olution.</P>
<P>"Your &s;cheme, Colonel Belgrave," &s;aid &s;he, "is equally vile and futile; though treachery may have brought you hither, you mu&s;t be convinced, that under the Marquis of Ro&s;line's roof, who by relation&s;hip as well as ho&s;pitality, is bound to protect me, you dare not, with impunity, offer me any in&s;ult. The Marquis will be at home immediately, if therefore you wi&s;h to pre|&s;erve the &s;emblance of honour, retire without further delay."</P>
<P>"Not to retire &s;o ea&s;ily," exclaimed Belgrave, "did I take &s;uch pains, or watch &s;o anxiou&s;ly for this inter|view. Fear not any in&s;ult; but till I have revealed the purpo&s;e of my &s;oul, I will not be forced from you; my love, or rather adoration, has known no abatement by your long concealment; and now that chance has &s;o happily thrown you in my way, I will not neglect u&s;ing any opportunity it may offer."</P>
<P>"Gracious heavens!" &s;aid Amanda, while her eyes fla&s;hed with indignation, "how can you have the effron|tery to avow your in&s;olent intentions; intentions which long &s;ince you mu&s;t have known would ever prove a|bortive?"</P>
<P>"And why, my Amanda," &s;aid he, again attempt|ing to &s;train her to his brea&s;t, while &s;he &s;hrunk from his gra&s;p, "why &s;hould they prove abortive? why &s;hould you be ob&s;tinate in refu&s;ing wealth, happine&s;s, the &s;in|cere, the ardent affection of a man, who in promoting your felicity, would con&s;titute his own? My life, my fortune would be at your command; my eternal grati|tude would be your's for any trifling &s;acrifice the world might think you made me; he&s;itate no longer about rai&s;ing your&s;elf to affluence, which, to a benevolent &s;pirit
<PB N="148" REF="038416_0341_1011E400A53BA1A8">
like your's, mu&s;t be &s;o peculiarly plea&s;ing:&mdash;He&s;itate not to &s;ecure independence to your father, promotion to your brother; and be a&s;&s;ured if the connection I formed in an ill fated hour, deceived by a &s;pecious ap|pearance of perfection, &s;hould ever be di&s;&s;olved, my hand, like my heart, &s;hall be your's."</P>
<P>"Mon&s;ter!" exclaimed Amanda, beholding him with horror, "your hand, was it at your di&s;po&s;al, like your other offers, I &s;hould &s;purn with contempt; cea&s;e to torment me," &s;he continued, "lea&s;t, in my own defence, I call upon tho&s;e who have power, as well as inclina|tion to cha&s;ti&s;e your in&s;olence. Let this con&s;ideration, joined to the certainty that your pur&s;uit mu&s;t ever prove unavailing, influence your future actions; for be a&s;&s;ur|ed that you are in every re&s;pect an object of abhorrence to my &s;oul."</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;poke, exerting all her &s;trength, &s;he bur&s;t from him, and attempted to gain the door. He flung him&s;elf between her and it, his face inflamed with pa&s;|&s;ion, and darting the mo&s;t malignant glances at her.</P>
<P>Terrified by his looks, Amanda, tried to avoid him; and when he caught her again in his arms &s;he &s;creamed aloud:&mdash;no one appeared:&mdash;her terror increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>"Oh Belgrave!" "cried &s;he, trembling, "if you have one principle of honour, one feeling of humanity remaining, retire; I will pardon and conceal what is pa&s;t, if you comply with my reque&s;t."</P>
<P>"I di&s;tre&s;s you, Amanda," &s;aid he, a&s;&s;uming a &s;oft|ened accent, "and it wounds me to the &s;oul to do &s;o, though you, cruel and inexorable, care not what pain you acca&s;ion me, hear me calmly, and be a&s;&s;ured, I &s;hall attempt no action which can offend you."</P>
<P>He led her again to the &s;ofa, and thus continued.</P>
<P>"Mi&s;led by fal&s;e views, you &s;hun and dete&s;t the only man who has had &s;ufficient &s;incerity to declare openly his intentions; inexperience and credulity have already made you a dupe to artifice. You imagined Sir Charles Bingley was a fervent admirer of your's, when be a&s;&s;ured, in following you, he only obeyed the dictates of an egregious vanity, which flattered him with the
<PB N="149" REF="038416_0342_1011E4041C5670B8">
hope of gaining your regard, and being di&s;tingui&s;hed by it: nothing was farther from his thoughts, as he him&s;elf confe&s;t to me, than &s;eriou&s;ly paying his addre&s;&s;es to you, and had you appeared willing, at la&s;t, to accept them, be a&s;&s;ured he would &s;oon have contrived &s;ome &s;cheme to di&s;engage him&s;elf from you. The attentions of Lord Mortimer are prompted by a motive much more danger|ous than that which in&s;tigated Sir Charles; he really admires you, and would have you believe his views are honourable; but beware of his duplicity, he &s;eeks to take advantage of the too great confidence you repo&s;e in him: his purpo&s;e once accompli&s;hed, he would &s;acrifice you to Lady Euphra&s;ia; and I know enough of her malevolent di&s;po&s;ition, to be convinced &s;he would enjoy her tri|umph over &s;o lovely a victim. Ah! my dear Amanda, even beauty and elegance like yours, would not, on the generality of mankind, have power to make them fore|go the advantages annexed to wealth; on Lord Mor|timer particularly, they would fail of that effect; his ambition and avarice are equal to his father's; and though his heart and &s;oul, I am confident, revolt from the per&s;on and mind of Lady Euphra&s;ia, he will unite him&s;elf to her, for the &s;ake of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing her fortune, and thus increa&s;ing his own power of procuring the gra|tifications he delights in. As my &s;ituation is known, I cannot be accu&s;ed of deception, and whatever I promi&s;e will be &s;trictly fulfilled: deliberate therefore no longer, my Amanda, on the cour&s;e you &s;hall pur&s;ue."</P>
<P>"No," cried &s;he, "I &s;hall indeed no longer deli|berate about it."</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;poke, &s;he &s;tarted from her &s;eat.&mdash;Belgrave again &s;eized her hand. At this moment a knocking was heard at the hall door, which echoed through the hou&s;e. Amanda trembled, and Belgrave pau&s;ed in a &s;peech he had begun. She &s;uppo&s;ed the Marquis had returned: it was improbable he would come to that room: and even if he did, from his di&s;tru&s;tful and ma|lignant temper, &s;he knew not whether &s;he would have rea&s;on to rejoice or regret his pre&s;ence. But how great was her confu&s;ion, when in&s;tead of his voice, &s;he heard
<PB N="150" REF="038416_0343_1011E406EB870548">
tho&s;e of the Marchione&s;s and her party. In a moment the dreadful con&s;equences which might en&s;ue from her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, ru&s;hed upon her mind. By the forc|ed attentions of the Marchione&s;s and Lady Euphra&s;ia, &s;he was not long deceived, and had rea&s;on to believe, from the inveterate di&s;like they bore her, that they would rejoice at an opportunity like the pre&s;ent, for traducing her fame; and with horror &s;he &s;aw, that ap|pearances, even in the eyes of candour, would be again&s;t her. She had po&s;itively, and unexpectedly refu&s;ed go|ing to the ball; &s;he had expre&s;t delight at the idea of &s;taying at home. Alas! would not all the&s;e circum|&s;tances be dwelt upon? What ideas might they now excite in Lord Mortimer, who already &s;hewed a ten|dency to jealou&s;y?</P>
<P>Half wild at the idea, &s;he cla&s;ped her hands together, and exclaimed, in a voice trembling with angui&s;h, "Merciful heaven, I am ruined for ever!"</P>
<P>"No, no," cried Belgrave, flinging him&s;elf at her feet, "pardon me, Amanda, and I never more will mo|le&s;t you; I &s;ee your principles are invincible; I ad|mire, I revere your purity, and never more will I at|tempt to injure it; I was on the point of declaring &s;o, when the cur&s;ed knock came to the door; compo&s;e your&s;elf, and con&s;ider what can be done in the pre&s;ent emergency; you will be ruined if I am &s;een with you; the malicious devils you live with, would never believe our united a&s;&s;everations of your innocence: conceal me, therefore, if po&s;&s;ible, till the family are &s;ettled, the per&s;on who let me in, will then &s;ecure my retreat, and I &s;wear &s;olemnly never more to trouble you."</P>
<P>Amanda he&s;itated between the confidence her inno|cence in&s;pired, and the dread of the unplea&s;ant con&s;truc|tion malice might put on her &s;ituation. She heard the party a&s;cending the &s;tairs: fear conquered her reluct|ance to concealment, and &s;he motioned to Belgrave to retire to a clo&s;et adjoining the dre&s;&s;ing room. He obey|ed the motion, and clo&s;ed the door &s;oftly after him.</P>
<P>Amanda, &s;natching up her book, endeavoured to com|po&s;e her&s;elf; but the effort was ineffectual; &s;he tremb|led
<PB N="151" REF="038416_0344_1011E40881D56FC8">
univer&s;ally; nor was her agitation dimini&s;hed, when from the out&s;ide of the door, Lady Euphra&s;ia called to her to open it. She tottered at it, and almo&s;t fainted on finding it locked; with difficulty &s;he opened it, and the whole party, followed by the Marquis, entered.</P>
<P>"Upon my word, Mi&s;s Fitzalan," &s;aid the Marchi|one&s;s, "you were determined no one &s;hould di&s;turb your meditations; I fear we have &s;urpri&s;ed you; but poor Euphra&s;ia was taken ill at the ball, and we were obliged to return with her."</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Fitzalan has not been much better, I believe," &s;aid Lady Euphra&s;ia, regarding her attentively.</P>
<P>"Good Lord! child," cried Lady Grey&s;tock, "what is the matter with you? why you look as pale as if you had &s;een a gho&s;t."</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Fitzalan is fond of &s;olitude," exclaimed the Marquis, preventing her reply to Lady Grey&s;tock. "When I returned home about an hour ago I &s;ent to reque&s;t her company in the parlour, which honour, I a&s;&s;ure your, I was refu&s;ed."</P>
<P>The me&s;&s;age indeed had been &s;ent, but never deliver|ed to Amanda."</P>
<P>"I a&s;&s;ure you, my lord," &s;aid &s;he, "I heard of no &s;uch reque&s;t."</P>
<P>"And pray, child, how have you been employed all this time?" a&s;ked Lady Grey&s;tock.</P>
<P>"In reading, Madam," faltered out Amanda, while her death like palene&s;s was &s;ucceeded by a deep blu&s;h.</P>
<P>"You are certainly ill," &s;aid Lord Mortimer, who &s;at be&s;ide her, in a voice expre&s;&s;ive of regret at the convic|tion: "you have been indulging melancholy ideas. I fear," continued he &s;oftly, and taking her hand, "for &s;urely&mdash;&s;urely to night you are uncommonly affected."</P>
<P>Amanda attempted to &s;peak: the contending emotions of her mind prevented her utterance, and the tears trick|led &s;ilently down her cheeks. Lord Mortimer &s;aw &s;he wi&s;hed to avoid notice, vet &s;carcely could he forbear reque&s;ting &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance for her.</P>
<P>Lady Euphra&s;ia now complained of a violent head|ach: the Marchione&s;s wanted to ring for her remedies:
<PB N="152" REF="038416_0345_1011E40A4EDDF438">
this Lady Euphra&s;ia oppo&s;ed; at la&s;t if as &s;uddenly re|collecting it, &s;he &s;aid, "in the clo&s;et there was a bottle of Eau de luce, which &s;he was certain would be of &s;er|vice to her."</P>
<P>At the mention of the clo&s;et, the blood ran cold through the veins of Amanda; but when &s;he &s;aw lady Euphra&s;ia ri&s;e to enter it, had death, in his mo&s;t fright|ful form &s;tared her in the face, &s;he could not have Betray|ed more horror. She looked towards it with a counte|nance as expre&s;&s;ive of wild affright, as Macbeth's when viewing the chair, on which the &s;pectre of the murder|ed Banquo &s;at. Lord Mortimer ob&s;erving the di&s;order of her looks, began to tremble; he gra&s;ped her hand with a convul&s;ive motion, and exclaimed,
"Amanda, what means this agitation?"</P>
<P>A loud &s;cream from Lady Euphra&s;ia broke upon their ears, and &s;he ru&s;hed from the clo&s;et, followed by Bel|grave.</P>
<P>"Gracious heavens!" exclaimed Lord Mortimer, dropping Amanda's hand, and ri&s;ing precipitately.</P>
<P>Amanda looked around&mdash;&s;he beheld every eye fa&s;tened on her with amazement and contempt: the &s;hock was too much for her to &s;upport: a confu&s;ed idea darted in|to her mind, that a deep laid plot had been concerted to ruin her: &s;he faintly exclaimed, " I am betrayed," and &s;unk back upon the &s;ofa.</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer &s;tarted at her exclamation. "Oh heavens!" cried he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> as he looked towards her, unable to &s;upport the &s;cene that would en&s;ue in con&s;equence of this di&s;covery, he &s;truck his forehead in an agony, and ru&s;hed out of the room.</P>
<P>In the hall he was &s;topt by Mrs. Jane, the maid ap|pointed by the Marchione&s;s to attend Amanda.</P>
<P>"Alack-a-day my Lord," &s;aid &s;he in a whimpering voice, "&s;omething dreadful, I am afraid, has happened above &s;tairs: Oh dear, what people &s;uffer &s;ometimes by their good nature; I am &s;ure, if I thought any harm would come of granting Mi&s;s Fitzalan's reque&s;t, he might have begged and prayed long enough, before I would have obliged her.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="038416_0346_1011E40D32709130">
"Did &s;he de&s;ire you to bring Colonel Belgrave to this hou&s;e?" a&s;ked Lord Mortimer.</P>
<P>"Oh to be &s;ure &s;he did, my Lord, or how &s;hould I ever have thought of &s;uch a thing: &s;he has been beg|ging and praying long enough, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o me to contrive &s;ome way of bringing him here; and &s;he told me a piteous &s;tory, which would have &s;oftened a &s;tone, of his being a &s;weetheart of her's before he was married."</P>
<P>"Merciful powers!" cried Lord Mortimer, cla&s;ping his hands together, "how have I been deceived?"</P>
<P>He was hurrying away, when Mrs. Jane caught his coat.</P>
<P>"I &s;hall lo&s;e my place," &s;aid &s;he &s;obbing, "that I &s;hall, mo&s;t certainly, for my Lord and Lady never will forgive my bringing any one, in &s;uch a way, into the hou&s;e; I am &s;ure I thought no great harm in it, and did it quite from good nature; for indeed how could one re|&s;i&s;t the poor dear young lady; &s;he cried and &s;aid, &s;he only wanted to bid farewell to her dear Belgrave."</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer could hear no more, he &s;hook her from him, and hurried from the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Amanda's faculties &s;uffered but a momentary &s;u&s;pen|&s;ion; as &s;he opened her eyes, her compo&s;ure and forti|tude returned.</P>
<P>"I am convinced," &s;aid &s;he, ri&s;ing, and advancing to the Marquis, "it will &s;hock your Lord&s;hip to hear, that it is the treachery of &s;ome per&s;on under your roof, has involved me in my pre&s;ent embarra&s;&s;ing &s;ituation. For my own ju&s;tification, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to acknowledge that I have long been the object of a pur&s;uit from Colo|nel Belgrave, as degrading to his character as in&s;ulting to mine. When he broke &s;o unexpectedly upon me to|night, he declared, even with effrontery declared, he had a friend in this hou&s;e, who gave him acce&s;s to it. As your gue&s;t, my Lord, I may expect your Lord&s;hip's protection: al&s;o that an immediate inquiry be made for the abettor in this &s;cheme again&s;t me, and a full di&s;co|very of it extorted, that &s;hould the affair be mentioned, in may be explained, and my fame cleared of every im|putation."</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="038416_0347_1011E41184AC51D0">
"That, Madam," &s;aid the Marquis, with a malici|ous &s;neer, "would not be quite &s;o ea&s;y a matter as you may perhaps &s;uppo&s;e; neither the world nor I am &s;o cre|dulous as you imagine; your &s;tory, Madam, by no means hangs well together; there is no per&s;on in my hou&s;e would have dared to commit the act you accu&s;e them of, as they mu&s;t know the con&s;equence of it would be im|mediate di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from my &s;ervice. Had not Colonel Belgrave been voluntarily admitted, he never would have been concealed: no, Madam, you would have re|joiced at the opportunity our pre&s;ence gave you, of pu|ni&s;hing his temerity." Innocence is bold, 'tis guilt alone is timerous."</P>
<P>The truth of part of his &s;peech &s;truck forcibly upon Amanda; but how could &s;he explain her conduct? how declare it was her dread of the Marchione&s;s and Lady Euphra&s;ia's malice, which had made her con&s;ent to con|ceal him.</P>
<P>"Oh! I &s;ee," &s;aid &s;he, in the agony of her &s;oul, "I &s;ee I am the dupe of complicated artifice."</P>
<P>"I never, in my life," cried the Marchione&s;s, "met with &s;uch a&s;&s;urance:&mdash;to de&s;ire the Marquis to be her champion."</P>
<P>"As &s;he was entru&s;ted to my care, however," exclaim|ed Lady Grey&s;tock, "I think it nece&s;&s;ary to inquire in|to the affair. Pray, Sir turning to the Colonel, "by what means did you come here?</P>
<P>The Colonel, with undimini&s;hed a&s;&s;urance, had hi|ther to &s;tood near the fatal clo&s;et leaning on a chair.</P>
<P>"That Madam," replied he, "I mu&s;t be excu&s;ed revealing: let me, however, a&s;&s;ure your Lady&s;hip, 'tis not on my own account I affect concealment." Here he glanced at amanda. "Tho&s;e parts of my conduct, how|ever, which I chu&s;e to conceal, I &s;hall always be rea|dy to defend."</P>
<P>"Sir," cried the Marquis, haughtily, "no explana|tion, or defence of your conduct, is here required, I have neither right nor inclination to interfere in Mi&s;s Fitzalan's concerns."</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="038416_0348_1011E413118949D0">
The Colonel bowed to the circle, and was retiring, when Amanda flew to him, and caught his arm, "Sure|ly, &s;urely," &s;aid &s;he, almo&s;t ga&s;ping for breath, " you cannot be &s;o inhuman, as to retire without explaining this whole affair. Oh! Belgrave, leave me not a prey to &s;lander; by all your hopes of mercy and forgivene&s;s hereafter, I conjure you to clear my fame."</P>
<P>"My dear creature," &s;aid he, in a low voice, yet loud enough to be heard by the whole party, "any thing I could &s;ay would be unavailing; you find they are determined not to &s;ee things in the light we wi&s;h them viewed: compo&s;e your&s;elf, I be&s;eech you, and be a&s;&s;ured, while I exi&s;t, you never &s;hall want comfort or affluence."</P>
<P>He gently di&s;engaged him&s;elf as he &s;poke, and quit|ted the room, leaving her, rivited to the floor in amazement, at his in&s;olence and perfidy.</P>
<P>"I am &s;ure," &s;aid Lady Grey&s;tock, "I &s;hall regret all my life the hour in which I took her under my pro|tection: though, indeed, from what I heard &s;oon after my arrival in London, I &s;hould have di&s;patched her back to her father; but I felt a fooli&s;h pity for her; I was in hopes, indeed, the &s;ociety I had introduced her to, would have produced a reformation, and that I might be the means of &s;aving a young creature from entire de&s;truc|tion.</P>
<P>"From what I have already &s;uffered by her family, nothing &s;hould have tempted me to take her under my roof," exclaimed the Marchione&s;s.</P>
<P>"Was &s;he my relation," cried the Marquis, "I &s;hould long &s;ince have come to a determination about her; as your's Madam," turning to the Marchione&s;s, "I &s;hall not attempt forming one; I deem it, however, ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to remove Lady Euphra&s;ia Suther|land from the hou&s;e, till the young lady chu&s;es to quit it; I &s;hall therefore order the carriage to be ready at an early hour for the villa."</P>
<P>"I &s;hall certainly accompany your Lord&s;hip," cried the Marchione&s;s, " for I cannot endure her &s;ight: and
<PB N="156" REF="038416_0349_1011E4160EA21BE8">
though &s;he de&s;erves it, it &s;hall not be &s;aid that we turn|ed her from the hou&s;e."</P>
<P>"The only mea&s;ure &s;he &s;hould pur&s;ue," exclaimed Lady Grey&s;tock, "is to &s;et off as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible for Ireland; when &s;he returns to ob&s;curity, the affair may die away."</P>
<P>"It may, however," &s;aid Amanda, "be yet revived, to cover with confu&s;ion its contrivers: to heaven I leave the vindication of my innocence: its ju&s;tice is &s;ure, though &s;ometimes &s;low, and the hour of retribution of|ten arrives, when lea&s;t expected: much as I have &s;uf|fered&mdash;much as I may &s;till &s;uffer I think my own &s;itua|tion preferable to theirs, who have &s;et their &s;nares around me: the injurer mu&s;t ever feel greater pangs than the injured&mdash;the pangs of guilt and remor&s;e. I &s;hall return to my ob&s;curity, happy in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, that it is not a &s;helter for &s;hame, but a refuge from cruelty I &s;eek: but can I be &s;urpri&s;ed at meeting cruelty from tho&s;e, who have long &s;ince waved the ties of kindred:&mdash;from tho&s;e," and &s;he glanced at Lady Grey&s;tock, "who have &s;et a&s;ide the claims of ju&s;tice and humanity."</P>
<P>The Marchione&s;s trembled with rage at this &s;peech, and as Amanda retired from the room, exclaimed, "in|tolerable a&s;&s;urance."</P>
<P>Amanda repaired immediately to her chamber: &s;he tottered as &s;he walked, and the hou&s;ekeeper and Mrs. Jane, who, with &s;ome other &s;ervants, had a&s;&s;embled out of curio&s;ity near the door, followed her thither.</P>
<P>The emotions &s;he had &s;o painfully &s;uppre&s;t, now bur&s;t forth with violence; &s;he fell into an agony of tears and &s;obs, which impeded her breathing. The hou&s;ekeeper and Jane loo&s;ened her clothes, and &s;upported her to the bed. In a &s;hort time &s;he was &s;ufficiently recovered, to be able to &s;peak, and reque&s;ted they would engage a carriage for her again&s;t the next day, at an early hour, that &s;he might commence her journey to Ireland; this they promi&s;ed, and at her de&s;ire retired.</P>
<P>Succe&s;s, but not happine&s;s, had crowned the Marchion|e&s;s's &s;cheme; &s;he triumphed in the di&s;grace &s;he had drawn upon Amanda; but feared that di&s;grace was only
<PB N="157" REF="038416_0350_1011E419417CC0A8">
temporary; &s;he had entangled her in a &s;nare, but dread|ed not having &s;ecured her in it; &s;he di&s;tru&s;ted tho&s;e who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted her de&s;igns, for the guilty will ever &s;u&s;pect each other; they might betray her, or Colonel Belgrave might repent; but &s;uch evils, if they did ever arrive, were probably far di&s;tant; in the interim, all &s;he de&s;ired to accompli&s;h, might be effected. Long had &s;he been meditating on &s;ome plan, which &s;hould ruin Aman|da forever, not only in the opinion of Lord Mortimer, but in the e&s;timation of the world. With the profliga|cy of Colonel Belgrave &s;he was well acquainted, and in|clined from it to believe, that he would readily join in any &s;cheme which could give him a chance of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing Amanda. On di&s;covering her re&s;idence, he had ordered his valet, who was a tru&s;ty agent in all his villainies, to endeavour to gain acce&s;s to the hou&s;e, that he might di&s;cover whether there was a chance of introducing him there. The valet obeyed his orders, and &s;oon attached him&s;elf to Mrs. Jane, whom the Marchione&s;s had placed about Amanda, from knowing &s;he was capable of any deceitful part. She was introduced to Belgrave, and a hand&s;ome pre&s;ent &s;ecured her in his intere&s;t.</P>
<P>She communicated to the Marchione&s;s particulars of their interview: from that period they had been &s;eek|ing to bring about &s;uch a &s;cene as was at la&s;t acted; for the conduct of Amanda had hitherto defeated their in|tentions. Her &s;taying from the ball at la&s;t gave the wi&s;hed for opportunity.</P>
<P>Lady Euphra&s;ia was apprized of the whole plot, and the hint of her indi&s;po&s;ition was given in the morning, that no &s;u&s;picion might be entertained in the evening, when mentioned as a plea for returning home earlier than was intended.</P>
<P>Colonel Belgrave was introduced into the clo&s;et by Mrs. Jane, through a door that opened from the lobby; and whil&s;t Amanda &s;at pen&s;ively reading, he &s;tole out, and &s;ecured the other door, as already mentioned.</P>
<P>When Lady Euphra&s;ia declared &s;he was too ill to con|tinue at the ball, Lord Mortimer offered to attend her
<PB N="158" REF="038416_0351_1011E41BDD22E878">
home; had he not done &s;o, the Marchione&s;s intended to have a&s;ked him.</P>
<P>The Marquis was per&s;uaded that Amanda was an art|ful and dangerous rival to his daughter, and he hated her from that con&s;ideration. The laws of ho&s;pitality obliged him to treat her with politene&s;s, but he gladly &s;eized the fir&s;t opportunity that offered for expre&s;&s;ing his di&s;like.</P>
<P>Lady Grey&s;tock &s;aw through the plot, but &s;he pro|fe&s;t her belief of Amanda's guilt, which was all the Marchione&s;s required.</P>
<P>The Marquis left the ladies together, while he went to give orders about his early journey.</P>
<P>Soon after his departure, a loud knocking was heard, which announced a vi&s;itor; and from the latene&s;s of the hour, they conjectured, and were right in doing &s;o, that it mu&s;t be Lord Mortimer.</P>
<P>After traver&s;ing &s;everal &s;treets, in an agony no tongue could de&s;cribe, he returned to Portman Square. His fancy pre&s;ented Amanda to his view, overwhelmed with &s;hame, and &s;inking beneath the keen reproaches levelled at her. In the idea of her &s;ufferings, all re&s;entment for her &s;uppo&s;ed perfidy was forgotten. Human nature was liable to err, and the noble&s;t efforts that nature could make, was to pardon &s;uch errors. To &s;peak comfort to this fallen angel, he felt would relieve the weight which pre&s;t upon his own brea&s;t. Pale and di&s;|ordered, he entered the room, and found the ladies ap|parently much affected.</P>
<P>"My dear Lord," &s;aid the Marchione&s;s, "I am glad you are come back; as a friend of the family, you may perhaps honour us with your advice on the pre|&s;ent occa&s;ion."</P>
<P>"Indeed," exclaimed Lady Grey&s;tock, "I &s;up|po&s;e his Lord&s;hip is at as great a lo&s;s to know what can be done as we are. Was the Colonel in a &s;ituation to make any reparation! but a married man, only think how horrible."</P>
<P>"Execrable mon&s;ter!" cried Lord Mortimer, &s;tart|ing from his &s;eat, and traver&s;ing the room; "it were a
<PB N="159" REF="038416_0352_1011E41D6DB63D70">
deed of kindne&s;s to mankind, to extirpate him from the earth:&mdash;but &s;ay," continued he, and his voice faultered as he &s;poke, "where is the unfortunate&mdash;," he could not pronounce the name of Amanda.</P>
<P>"In her own room," replied the Marchione&s;s; "I a&s;&s;ure you, &s;he behaved with not a little in&s;olence, on Lady Grey&s;tock's advi&s;ing her to return home. For my part, I &s;hall let her act as &s;he plea&s;es."</P>
<P>She then proceeded to mention the Marquis's re&s;olu|tion of leaving the hou&s;e till &s;he had quitted it, and that he in&s;i&s;ted on their accompanying him.</P>
<P>"To return to her father, is certainly the only eli|gible plan &s;he can pur&s;ue," &s;aid Lord Mortimer, "but allow me," continued he, "to reque&s;t, that your La|dy&s;hip will not impute to in&s;olence, any expre&s;&s;ion which dropt from her: pity her wounded feelings, and &s;often her &s;orrows."</P>
<P>"I declare," cried Lady Euphra&s;ia, "I thought I &s;hould have fainted from the pity I felt for her."</P>
<P>"You pitied her then," &s;aid Lord Mortimer &s;itting down by her Lady&s;hip, "you pitied and &s;oothed her afflictions?"</P>
<P>"Yes, indeed," replied &s;he.</P>
<P>If ever Lady Euphra&s;ia appeared plea&s;ing it the eyes of Lord Mortimer, it was at this moment, when he was credulous enough to believe &s;he had &s;hed the tear of pity o'er his lo&s;t Amanda.</P>
<P>He took her hand, "Ah! my dear Lady Euphra&s;ia," &s;aid he, in an accent of melting &s;oftne&s;s, "perhaps even now &s;he needs con&s;olation: a gentle female friend would be a comfort to her wounded heart."</P>
<P>Lady Euphra&s;ia immediately took the hint, and &s;aid &s;he would go to her.</P>
<P>He led her to the door. "You are going," cried he, "to perform the office of an angel&punc; to con&s;ole the afflicted: ah! well does it become the young and gen|tle of your &s;ex, to pity &s;uch misfortunes."</P>
<P>Her Lady&s;hip retired, but not indeed to the cham|ber of the forlorn Amanda; in her own &s;he vented the rage of her &s;oul, in &s;omething little &s;hort of execrations
<PB N="160" REF="038416_0353_1011E4204D5AF9D0">
again&s;t Lord Mortimer, for the affection &s;he &s;aw he &s;till retained for Amanda.</P>
<P>On her Lady&s;hip's retiring, Lady Grey&s;tock menti|oned every particular &s;he had heard from Mrs. Jen|nings, and bitterly lamented her ever having taken Amanda under her protection.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject was too painful to be long endured by Lord Mortimer. He had heard of the early hour fixed for the journey, and &s;aying he would no longer keep the ladies from repo&s;e, precipitately retired. He gave his man directions to watch their motions, and inform him when they left town.</P>
<P>Exhau&s;ted by the violence of her emotions, a tempo|rary forgetfulne&s;s &s;tole over the &s;en&s;es of Amanda, on her being left to &s;olitude. In this &s;tate &s;he continued, till rou&s;ed by a bu&s;tle in the hou&s;e:&mdash;&s;he &s;tarted, li&s;ten|ed, and heard the &s;ound of a carriage; &s;uppo&s;ing it to be the one &s;he had ordered for her departure, &s;he &s;prang from the bed, and going to the window, &s;aw, in&s;tead of one for her, the Marquis's, into which he was hand|ing the ladies. As &s;oon as it drove from the door, &s;he rang the bell, and the hou&s;e-keeper immediately ap|peared, as Mrs. Jane had attended the Marchione&s;s to the villa. Amanda enquired "whether a carriage, as &s;he directed, had been engaged for her."</P>
<P>The hou&s;e-keeper replied, "the hour in which &s;he &s;poke was too late for &s;uch a purpo&s;e, but &s;he had now &s;ent for one."</P>
<P>Amanda endeavoured to exert her&s;elf, and was pack|ing up her clothes, when a maid entered the chamber, and &s;aid, "Lord Mortimer was below, and wi&s;hed to &s;peak to her."</P>
<P>Tumultuous joy pervaded the mind of Amanda; &s;he had believed it probable &s;he &s;hould not &s;ee him again before her departure for Ireland, from whence &s;he had determined writing to him the particulars of the affair. His vi&s;it &s;eemed to announce he thought not unfavoura|bly of her: &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed he came to a&s;&s;ure her, that his opinion of her integrity was un&s;haken, "and I &s;hall yet
<PB N="161" REF="038416_0354_1011E4249FAD2568">
triumph," cried &s;he, in the tran&s;port of the idea, "over malice and treachery."</P>
<P>She &s;prung pa&s;t the maid; her feet &s;carce touched the ground, and in a moment &s;he found her&s;elf in the arms of Lord Mortimer, which involuntarily opened to receive her, for trembling, weak and di&s;ordered, &s;he would el&s;e, on &s;eeing him, have &s;unk to the floor.</P>
<P>He &s;upported her to a &s;ofa; in a little time &s;he rai&s;ed her head from his &s;houlder, and exclaimed,</P>
<P>"Oh! you are come! I know you are come to com|fort me."</P>
<P>"Would to heaven," he an&s;wered, "I were capable of either giving or receiving comfort; the period, how|ever, I tru&s;t, may yet arrive, when we &s;hall both, at lea&s;t be more compo&s;ed:&mdash;to mitigate your &s;orrows, would le&s;&s;en my own; for never, oh never can my heart forget the love and e&s;teem it once bore Amanda."</P>
<P>"Once bore her!" repeated Amanda, "once bore her, Lord Mortimer, do you &s;ay?&mdash;then you wi&s;h to im|ply, they no longer exi&s;t."</P>
<P>The tone of angui&s;h in which &s;he &s;poke, pierced the heart of Mortimer; unable to &s;peak, he aro&s;e, and walk|ed to the window to hide his emotion.</P>
<P>His words, his &s;ilence, all conveyed a fatal truth to Amanda; &s;he &s;aw a dreadful and eternal &s;eparation ef|fected between her and Lord Mortimer:&mdash;She beheld her&s;elf deprived of reputation, loaded with calumny, and no longer an object of love, but of dete&s;tation and contempt.</P>
<P>Her angui&s;h was almo&s;t too great to bear, yet the pride of injured innocence made her wi&s;h to conceal it; and as Lord Mortimer &s;tood at the window &s;he deter|mined to try and leave the room without his knowledge; but ere &s;he gained the door, her head grew giddy, her &s;trength failed, &s;he &s;taggered, faintly &s;creamed on find|ing her&s;elf falling, and &s;unk upon the floor.</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer wildly called for a&s;&s;i&s;tance; he rai&s;ed and carried her back to the &s;ofa; he &s;trained her to his bo&s;om; ki&s;&s;ed her pale lips and wept over her.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="038416_0355_1011E426307CA0D0">
"I have wounded your gentle &s;oul, my Amanda," he cried, "but I have tortured my own by doing &s;o; ah! &s;till deare&s;t of women, did the world compa&s;&s;ionate your errors, as I compa&s;&s;ionate them, neither contempt nor calumny would ever be your portion. How pale &s;he looks" &s;aid he, rai&s;ing his head to gaze upon her face; "how like a lovely flower untimely faded: yet were it happine&s;s for her never to revive: a &s;oul like her's, ori|ginally noble, mu&s;t be wretched under the pre&s;&s;ure of &s;corn. Execrable Belgrave! the faire&s;t work of heaven is de&s;troyed by you. Oh! my Amanda, my di&s;tre&s;s is &s;urely &s;evere, though angui&s;h rives my heart for your lo&s;s, I mu&s;t conceal it; the &s;ad luxury of grief will be denied me; for the world would &s;mile if I could &s;ay I now lamented you."</P>
<P>Such were the effu&s;ions of &s;orrow which broke from Lord Mortimer, o'er the in&s;en&s;ible Amanda. The hou&s;e|keeper, who had been li&s;tening all this time, now appear|ed, as if in obedience to his call, and offered her a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance in recovering Amanda. Heavy &s;ighs, at length, gave hopes of her re&s;toration. Lord Mortimer, unable to &s;upport her pathetic lamentations, determined to depart ere &s;he was perfectly &s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Fitzalan," &s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to the hou&s;e-keeper, "will wi&s;h, I am convinced, to quit this hou&s;e immediately; I &s;hall take upon my&s;elf to procure her a carriage, al&s;o a proper attendant for her journey, which, I flatter my&s;elf, &s;he will be able to commence in a few hours: be kind, be gentle to her, my good woman, and depend on my eternal gratitude. When &s;he is recovered, deliver her this letter."</P>
<P>The hou&s;e-keeper promi&s;ed to ob&s;erve his injunctions, and he departed.</P>
<P>To Ireland, with Amanda, he intended &s;ending an old female &s;ervant, who had formerly been an attendant of his mother's, and his own man. He was &s;hocked at the conduct of the Marchione&s;s and Lady Grey&s;tock, and thought them guilty of the highe&s;t inhumanity, in thus de&s;erting Amanda. The letter he had put into the hou&s;e|keeper's hands excited her curio&s;ity &s;o &s;trongly, that &s;he
<PB N="163" REF="038416_0356_1011E428D557B308">
was tempted to gratify it. Amanda was not in a &s;itua|tion to perceive what &s;he did: the letter could ea&s;ily be &s;caled again; and, in &s;hort, without longer he&s;itation, &s;he opened it. How great was her amazement, on finding it contained a bank note for five-hundred pounds; the words were as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>Con&s;ider me, Amanda, in the light of a brother: as &s;uch accept my &s;ervices: to &s;erve you, in any man|ner, will be a &s;ource of con&s;olation, which, I flatter my&s;elf, you will be happy to allow me. 'Tis nece&s;&s;a|ry you &s;hould return immediately to your father; he|&s;itate not then about u&s;ing the inclo&s;ed; your comply|ing with my reque&s;t, will prove that you yet retain a friend&s;hip for</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>MORTIMER.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>"What a &s;um," cried the hou&s;ekeeper, as &s;he exa|mined the note, "what a nice little independency would this, in addition to what I have already &s;aved, be for an hone&s;t woman? What a pity it is &s;uch a creature as it is de&s;igned for &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s it?" The hou&s;ekeep|er, like her lady, was fertile in invention:&mdash;to be &s;ure there was &s;ome danger in her pre&s;ent &s;cheme, but for &s;uch a prize it was worth her while to run &s;ome ri&s;k. Could &s;he but get Amanda off, ere the carriage from Lord Mortimer arrived, &s;he believed all would &s;ucceed as &s;he could wi&s;h. Amanda, ignorant as &s;he was of Lord Mortimer's intentions, would not, con&s;equently be influenced by them, to oppo&s;e any thing &s;he could do. Full of this idea, &s;he ran out, and calling a footman, high in her favour, de&s;ired him immediately to procure a travelling chai&s;e for Mi&s;s Fitzalan. She then returned to Amanda, who was ju&s;t beginning to move.</P>
<P>"Come, come," cried &s;he, going to her, and rough|ly &s;haking her &s;houlder, "have done with tho&s;e trage|dy airs, and prepare your&s;elf again&s;t the carriage you ordered comes: it will be at the door in a few minutes."</P>
<P>Amanda looked round the room, "Is Lord Morti|mer gone then?" &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>"Lord, to be &s;ure he is," cried the hou&s;ekeeper, "he left you on the floor, and as he went out, he &s;aid,
<PB N="164" REF="038416_0357_1011E42A718AA9B8">
you &s;hould never have another opportunity of deceiv|ing him."</P>
<P>A &s;udden frenzy &s;eemed to &s;eize Amanda: &s;he wrung her hands, called upon Lord Mortimer in the impa&s;|&s;ioned language of de&s;pair, and flung her&s;elf on the ground, exclaiming, "this la&s;t &s;troke is more than I can bear."</P>
<P>The hou&s;ekeeper grew alarmed, le&s;t her agitation &s;hould retard her departure; &s;he rai&s;ed her forcibly from the ground, and &s;aid, "&s;he mu&s;t compo&s;e her&s;elf to be|gin her journey, which was unavoidable, as the Mar|chione&s;s had given ab&s;olute orders to have her &s;ent from the hou&s;e early in the morning."</P>
<P>"Accur&s;ed hou&s;e!" &s;aid Amanda, who&s;e rea&s;on was re&s;tored by the &s;trenuous remon&s;trances of the hou&s;e|keeper, "Oh! that I had never entered it." She then told her companion, "if &s;he would a&s;&s;i&s;t her, as &s;he was almo&s;t too weak to do any thing her&s;elf, &s;he would be ready again&s;t the carriage came." The hou&s;e-keeper and maid accordingly attended her to her chamber: the former brought her drops, and the latter a&s;&s;i&s;ted in put|ting on her habit, and packing up her clothes. Amanda having &s;ecured her trunks, de&s;ired they might be &s;ent, by the fir&s;t opportunity, to Ca&s;tle Carberry; &s;he had left a great many clothes there, &s;o took nothing at pre|&s;ent with her, but a &s;mall quantity of linen. She had but a few guineas in her pur&s;e: her watch, however, was valuable; and if &s;he had money enough to carry her to Dublin, &s;he knew there &s;he might procure a &s;uf|ficient &s;um on it to carry her home.</P>
<P>At la&s;t the carriage came; with a trembling frame, and half broken heart, Amanda entered it. She &s;aw Nicholas, the footman, who had procured it, ready mounted to attend her. She told him it was unnece&s;&s;ary to do &s;o, but he declared he could not think of letting &s;o young a lady travel unprotected. She was plea&s;ed at his attention: &s;he had &s;huddered at the idea of her for|lorn &s;ituation, and now dropt a tear of &s;weet &s;en&s;ibility, at finding &s;he was not utterly de&s;erted by every human being. The carriage took the road to Park-Gate, as
<PB N="165" REF="038416_0358_1011E42FE59FB2D8">
Amanda cho&s;e to embark from thence, the journey be|ing &s;o much nearer to it than to Holyhead. It was now about eight o'clock; after travelling about four hours, the chai&s;e &s;topt at a &s;mall hou&s;e on the road &s;ide, which appeared to be a common ale-hou&s;e. Amanda was un|willing to enter it, but the hor&s;es were here to be chan|ged; and &s;he was &s;hewn into a dirty parlour, where, al|mo&s;t &s;inking with weakne&s;s, &s;he ordered tea to be im|mediately brought in. She was much a&s;toni&s;hed, as &s;he &s;at at the tea-table, to &s;ee Nicholas enter the room, with a familiar air, and &s;eat him&s;elf by her. She &s;tared at fir&s;t, &s;uppo&s;ing him intoxicated; but perceiving no &s;igns of this in his countenance, began to fear that the in|&s;ults &s;he had received at the Marquis's, made him think him&s;elf authorized to treat her with this in&s;olence. She ro&s;e abruptly, and &s;ummoning all her re&s;olution to her aid, de&s;ired him to retire, adding, "if his attendance was requi&s;ite, &s;he would ring for him."</P>
<P>Nicholas al&s;o quitted his &s;eat, and following her, caught her in his arms, exclaiming, "ble&s;s us how hoity toity you are grown."</P>
<P>Amanda &s;hrieked, and &s;tamped on the floor, in an agony of terror and indignation.</P>
<P>"Why now really," &s;aid he, "after what happened at home. I think you need not be &s;o coy with me."</P>
<P>"Oh! &s;ave me, heaven, from this wretch," was all the affrighted Amanda could articulate.</P>
<P>The door opened, a waiter appeared, and told Nicho|las he was wanted without. Nicholas relea&s;ed Amanda, and ran directly from the room. Amanda &s;unk upon a chair, and her head turned giddy at the idea of the dangers with which &s;he was &s;urrounded. She &s;aw her|&s;elf in the power of a wretch, perhaps wretches, for the hou&s;e &s;eemed a proper place for &s;cenes of villainy, with|out the means of delivering her&s;elf. She walked to the window; a confu&s;ed idea of getting through it, and running from the hou&s;e, darted into her mind, but &s;he turned from it in agony, at &s;eeing a number of country

men drinking before it. She now could only rai&s;e her feeble hands to heaven to &s;upplicate its protection.</P>
<P>She pa&s;t &s;ome minutes in this manner, when the lock turned, and made her &s;hudder; but it was the landlady alone who entered; &s;he came, &s;he &s;aid, with Nicholas's re&s;pectful duty, and he was &s;orry he was obliged to go back to town, without &s;eeing her &s;afe to her journey's end.</P>
<P>"Is he really gone?" a&s;ked Amanda, with all the ea|gerne&s;s of joy.</P>
<P>"Yes," the woman &s;aid, "a per&s;on had followed him from London on purpo&s;e to bring him back."</P>
<P>"Is the carriage ready?" cried Amanda.</P>
<P>She was informed it was.</P>
<P>"Let me fly, then," &s;aid &s;he, running to the door, "let me fly, or the wretch may return."</P>
<P>The landlady impeded her progre&s;s, to tell her the bill was not yet &s;ettled. Amanda pulled out her pur&s;e, and be&s;ought her not to detain her. This the woman had no de&s;ire to do: things were therefore &s;ettled without delay between them, and Amanda was driven, with as much expedition as &s;he could de&s;ire, from the terrifying man&s;ion. The chai&s;e had proceeded about two miles, when, in the middle of a &s;olitary road, or rather lane, by the &s;ide of a wood, it &s;uddenly &s;topt. Amanda, alarmed at every incident, ha&s;tily looked out, and in|quired what was the matter; but how impo&s;&s;ible to de|&s;cribe her terror, when &s;he beheld Colonel Belgrave, and Nicholas &s;tanding by him. She &s;hrunk back, and en|treated the po&s;tilion to drive on; but he heeded not her entreaty. Nicholas opened the door, and Belgrave &s;prang into the carriage. Amanda attempted to bur&s;t open the door at the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, but he caught her to his bo|&s;om, and the hor&s;es &s;et off at full &s;peed. Colonel Bel|grave's valet had been &s;ecreted by Mrs. Jane the pre|ceding night in the hou&s;e, that he might be able to give his ma&s;ter intelligence of all that pa&s;t within it, in con|&s;equence of his being di&s;covered in the clo&s;et. On hearing the family were gone to the Marquis's villa, Belgrave believed he could ea&s;ily prevail on the dome&s;|tics
<PB N="167" REF="038416_0360_1011E4341D3E6B70">
to deliver up Amanda to him. Elated with this hope, he reached the hou&s;e, attended by his valet, ju&s;t after &s;he had quitted it. The hou&s;e-keeper he&s;itated to inform him of the road &s;he had taken, till &s;he had pro|cured what &s;he knew would be the con&s;equence of her he&s;itation, a large bribe. Hor&s;es were then immediate|ly procured, and Belgrave and his &s;ervant &s;et off in pur|&s;uit of Amanda. The &s;ight of a travelling chai&s;e at the little inn already mentioned, prompted their inqui|ries; and on finding the chai&s;e waited for Amanda, the Colonel retired to a private room, &s;ent for Nicholas, and &s;ecured him in his intere&s;t. It was &s;ettled they &s;hould repair to the wood, by which the po&s;tilion was bribed to pa&s;s, and from thence proceed to a country hou&s;e of the Colonel's. Their &s;cheme accompli&s;hed, Nicholas, happy in the &s;ervice he had done, or rather the reward he had obtained for that &s;ervice, again turned his face towards London.</P>
<P>The carriage and attendants Lord Mortimer procured for Amanda arrived even earlier than the hou&s;e-keeper had expected, and &s;he ble&s;t her lucky &s;tars for the preci|pitancy with which &s;he had hurried off Amanda.</P>
<P>They were followed by his Lord&s;hip him&s;elf, who&s;e wretched heart could not &s;upport the idea of letting A|manda depart without once more beholding her. Great was his di&s;may, his a&s;toni&s;hment, when the hou&s;e keeper informed him &s;he was gone.</P>
<P>"Gone!" he repeated, changing colour.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e-keeper &s;aid, that without her knowledge Mi&s;s Fitzalan had a chai&s;e hired, and the moment it came to the door, &s;tept into it, notwith&s;tanding &s;he was told his Lord&s;hip meant to provide every thing proper for her journey him&s;elf; "but &s;he &s;aid, my Lord" cried the hou&s;e-keeper, "&s;he wanted none of your care, and that &s;he could never get fa&s;t enough from a hou&s;e, or from people, where, and by whom, &s;he had been &s;o ill treated."</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer a&s;ked if &s;he had any attendant, and whether &s;he took the letter.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e-keeper an&s;wered both the&s;e que&s;tions in the affirmative; " Truly, my Lord," &s;he continued, "I
<PB N="168" REF="038416_0361_1011E435D6284D60">
believe your Lord&s;hip &s;aid &s;omething in that letter which plea&s;ed her, for &s;he &s;miled on opening it, and &s;aid, "Well, well, this is &s;omething like comfort."</P>
<P>"And was &s;he really &s;o mean," he was on the point of a&s;king, but he timely checked a que&s;tion which was &s;pringing from a heart that &s;ickened at finding the ob|ject of its tendere&s;t affections unworthy in every re&s;pect of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them. Every idea of this kind &s;oon gave way to anxiety on her account; his heart mi&s;gave him at her undertaking &s;o long a journey under the pro|tection of a common &s;ervant; and unable to endure his apprehen&s;ions, he determined in&s;tantly to pur&s;ue, and &s;ee her &s;afe him&s;elf to the de&s;tined port.</P>
<P>The woman who had hitherto &s;at in the chai&s;e, was ordered home; he entered it with eagerne&s;s, and promi&s;|ed liberally to reward the po&s;tilions, if they u&s;ed expedi|tion. They had changed hor&s;es but once, when Lord Mortimer &s;aw Nicholas approaching, whom, at the fir&s;t glance, he knew. He &s;topt the carriage, and called out, "Where have you left Mi&s;s Fitzalan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">"</P>
<P>"Faith, my Lord," cried Nicholas, in&s;tantly &s;top|ping, and taking off his hat, "in very good company; I left her with Colonel Belgrave, who was waiting, by appointment, on the road for her."</P>
<P>"Oh! horrible infatuation!" &s;aid Lord Mortimer, "that nothing can &s;natch her from the arms of infamy."</P>
<P>The po&s;tillion de&s;ired to know whether he &s;hould re|turn to London.</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer he&s;itated, and at la&s;t de&s;ired him to go on, according to his fir&s;t directions. He re&s;olved to proceed to Parkgate, and di&s;cover whether Amanda had returned to Ireland. They had not proceeded far, when they overtook a travelling chai&s;e. As Lord Mortimer pa&s;t he looked into it, and beheld Amanda reclined on the bo&s;om of Belgrave. He trembled univer&s;ally, clo&s;ed his eyes, and &s;ighed out the name of the perfidious Amanda. When they had got &s;ome way before the other chai&s;e, he de&s;ired the po&s;tillion to &s;trike off into another road, which, by a circuit of a few miles, would bring them back to London. Amanda, it was evident, had put her|&s;elf

under the protection of Belgrave, and to know whe|ther &s;he went to Ireland, was now of little con&s;equence to him, as he &s;uppo&s;ed her unreclaimable; but how im|po&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe his di&s;tre&s;s and confu&s;ion, when al|mo&s;t the fir&s;t object he beheld on alighting in St. James's Square, was his aunt, Lady Martha Dormer, who, in compliance with his urgent reque&s;t, had ha&s;|tened to London. Had a &s;pectre cro&s;&s;ed his &s;ight, he could not have been more &s;hocked.</P>
<P>"Well, my dear Frederick," &s;aid her Lady&s;hip, you &s;ee I lo&s;t no time in obeying your wi&s;hes: I have flown hither, I may indeed &s;ay, on the wings of love: but where is this little divinity of thine? I long to have a peep at her godde&s;s-&s;hip."</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer, inexpre&s;&s;ibly &s;hocked, turned to the window.</P>
<P>"I &s;hall &s;ee, to be &s;ure," cried her Lady&s;hip, "quite a little paragon: po&s;itively, Frederick, I will be intro|duced this very evening."</P>
<P>"My dear aunt, my dear Lady Martha," &s;aid Lord Mortimer, impatiently, "for heaven's &s;ake &s;pare me."</P>
<P>"But tell me," &s;he continued, "when I &s;hall com|mence this attack upon your father's heart?"</P>
<P>"Never, never," &s;ighed Mortimer half di&s;tracted.</P>
<P>"What. you &s;uppo&s;e he will prove inflexible? but I do not de&s;pair of convincing you to the contrary: tell me Frederick, when the little charmer can be &s;een!"</P>
<P>"Oh God!" cried Mortimer, &s;triking his forehead, "&s;he is lo&s;t," &s;aid he, "&s;he is lo&s;t forever."</P>
<P>Lady Martha was alarmed: &s;he now, for the fir&s;t time, noticed the wild and palid looks of her nephew.</P>
<P>"Gracious heaven!" &s;he exclaimed, "What is the matter?"</P>
<P>The dreadful explanation Lord Mortimer now found him&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of giving: the &s;hame of ac|knowledging he was &s;o deceived: the agony he &s;uffered from that deception, joined to the exce&s;&s;ive agitation and fatigue he had &s;uffered the preceding night, and the pre&s;ent day, &s;o powerfully a&s;&s;ailed him at this moment,
<PB N="170" REF="038416_0363_1011E43C321BD1E0">
that his &s;en&s;es &s;uddenly gave way, and he actually faint|ed on the floor.</P>
<P>What a &s;ight for the tender Lady Martha: &s;he &s;aw &s;omething dreadful had happened, and what this was, Lord Mortimer, as &s;oon as recovered, informed her.</P>
<P>He then retired to his chamber; he could neither con|ver&s;e, nor bear to be conver&s;ed with: his fonde&s;t hopes were bla&s;ted: nor could he forego the &s;ad indulgence of mourning over them in &s;olitude; he felt almo&s;t convinc|ed, that the hold Amanda had on his affections, could not be withdrawn: he had con&s;idered her as &s;carcely le&s;s than his wife, and had &s;he been really &s;uch, her pre|&s;ent conduct could not have given him more angui&s;h. Had &s;he been &s;natched from him by the hand of death; had &s;he been wedded to a worthy character, he could have &s;ummoned fortitude to his aid, but to find her the prey of a villain, was a &s;troke too horrible to bear, at lea&s;t for a long period, with patience.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AMANDA had fainted &s;oon after Colonel Belgrave entered the carriage, and &s;he was reclining on his bo&s;om in a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility, when Lord Mortimer pa&s;t. In this &s;ituation &s;he continued, till they had gained a &s;olitary road, when the carriage &s;topt, and water procured from an adjacent cottage, being &s;prinkled on her face, &s;he recovered: but either by arguments, or actions, &s;he was now unable to op|po&s;e Belgrave; &s;he felt a weakne&s;s through her whole frame, which &s;he believed the forerunner of death; and a languor on her mind that almo&s;t deprived it of the perception of mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>The refre&s;hments ordered to her, &s;he could only refu&s;e by a motion of her hand; and in this manner they pro|ceeded till about nine o'clock at night, when they enter|ed an exten&s;ive wood, in the very centre of which &s;tood Colonel Belgrave's man&s;ion. He carried Amanda him|&s;elf into it, and laid her upon a &s;ofa in a large parlour.&mdash;Some female dome&s;tics appeared with drops and cordials, to try to recover her from the almo&s;t lifele&s;s &s;tate in which &s;he lay. One of them pre&s;ented a letter to Colo|nel Belgrave, which excited no little perturbation in his mind; it came expre&s;s to inform him that his uncle, who&s;e e&s;tate and title he was heir to, lay at the point of death, and that his pre&s;ence immediately was required.</P>
<P>The Colonel was not &s;o ab&s;olutely engro&s;&s;ed by love, as to be incapable of attending to his intere&s;t. An ad|dition to his fortune was extremely agreeable, as his af|fairs
<PB N="172" REF="038416_0365_1011E440809C8268">
were &s;omewhat deranged; and as Amanda was not in a &s;ituation at pre&s;ent to comply with any over|tures he &s;hould make, his re&s;olution was immediately formed to &s;et off without delay, and again&s;t his return, he tru&s;ted Amanda would not only be recovered, but willing to accede to his wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>He di&s;mi&s;t the woman who had brought her a little to her&s;elf, and taking her hand, informed her of the painful nece&s;&s;ity he was under of departing for a &s;hort time: he al&s;o mentioned his hopes, that on his return he &s;hould have no ob&s;tacle thrown in the way of his happi|ne&s;s by her. "You mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible my dear Amanda," &s;aid he with coolne&s;s, "that your reputation is as much gone, as if you had complied with my wi&s;hes; &s;ince it is &s;acrificed, why not enjoy the advantages that may, that will certainly attend, the reality of that &s;acrifice."</P>
<P>"Mon&s;ter!" cried Amanda, "your arts may have de&s;troyed my fame, but my innocence bids defiance to your power."</P>
<P>"Conquer your ob&s;tinacy, Amanda," replied he, "again&s;t I return, or I &s;hall not promi&s;e but what I may at la&s;t be irritated. As you will have no occa&s;ion for money here, you mu&s;t excu&s;e me, my dear crea|ture, if I take your pur&s;e into my own keeping; my dome&s;tics may be faithful, when they have no induce|ment to the contrary; but no bribery, no corruption, you know."</P>
<P>He then deliberately took Amanda's pur&s;e and watch from her pocket, and depo&s;ited them in his own. He had already given directions to his &s;ervants concerning the treatment of Amanda, and now ordered them to carry her to a chamber, and make her &s;ome refre&s;hment.</P>
<P>"Reflect, Amanda," &s;aid he, ere &s;he retired, "on your pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and timely e&s;timate the advan|tages I offer to your acceptance; wealth, plea&s;ure, the attentions of a man who adores you, are not to be de&s;pi|&s;ed. Upon my &s;oul it grieves me to leave you, but the joys of meeting, will, I tru&s;t, pay the pangs of ab&s;ence."</P>
<P>As he &s;poke, he attempted to embrace her, but &s;he faintly &s;hrieked, and &s;unk from his gra&s;p. He looked
<PB N="173" REF="038416_0366_1011E4440F2FC588">
provoked, but as he had no time to lo&s;e, he re&s;erved a declaration of his anger for another opportunity, and directly &s;et off for his uncle's.</P>
<P>Amanda was &s;upported to a chamber, and lay down in her clothes on a bed. They offered her bread and wine, but &s;he was too &s;ick to touch any. To remon|&s;trate with the in&s;olent looking creatures who &s;urround|ed her, &s;he knew would be unavailing, and &s;he turned her face on the pillow to &s;tifle her &s;obs, as &s;he believed they would exult in her di&s;tre&s;s. Death &s;he thought approaching, and the idea of being &s;eparated from the dear objects who would have &s;oothed its la&s;t pangs, was dreadful; her father in agony, and O&s;car, her beloved brother, bewailing her with tears of &s;orrow, were the images fancy pre&s;ented to her view.</P>
<P>"Dear objects of my love," &s;he &s;oftly exclaimed, "Amanda &s;hall no more behold you, but her la&s;t &s;igh will be breathed for you. Ah! why, why," &s;he cried, "did I &s;uffer my&s;elf to be &s;eparated from my father?"</P>
<P>A young woman leaned over Amanda, and &s;urveyed her with the mo&s;t malignant &s;crutiny: &s;he was daugh|ter to Belgrave's &s;teward, and neither &s;he nor her father po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ufficient virtue to make them reject the offers Belgrave made them on her account. His attachment to her was violent, but tran&s;ient, and in the height of it he made her mi&s;tre&s;s of the man&s;ion &s;he now occupied, which character &s;he maintained with tyrannic &s;way over the re&s;t of the dome&s;tics. Belgrave was really ignorant of the violence of her temper, and had no idea &s;he would dare di&s;pute his inclinations, or to di&s;obey his orders: he believed &s;he would be &s;ub&s;ervient to both, and from this belief gave Amanda particularly into her charge.</P>
<P>But &s;carcely had he departed, ere &s;he &s;wore, "that let the co&s;equence be what it would, the vile wretch he had brought into the hou&s;e to in&s;ult her, &s;hould never remain in it: &s;he &s;hall tramp," cried &s;he, "though I follow her my&s;elf, when he returns, for &s;uch a little hu&s;&s;ey &s;hall never triumph over me."</P>
<P>The &s;ervants, ignorant and timorous, did not at|tempt to oppo&s;e her.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="038416_0367_1011E4469FF64BF8">
"Come, madam," &s;aid &s;he, &s;uddenly &s;eizing Aman|da's arm, and pulling her from the pillow, "have done with the&s;e langui&s;hing airs, and march."</P>
<P>"What do you mean?" cried Amanda, trembling at her inflamed countenance</P>
<P>"Why I mean you &s;hall quit this hou&s;e directly, and I wonder Colonel Belgrave could have the a&s;&s;urance to bring &s;uch a creature as you into it."</P>
<P>"You mi&s;take, indeed," &s;aid Amanda, "treachery, not inclination, brought me into it, and I am not what you &s;uppo&s;e: if, as you &s;ay, you allow me to depart, I &s;hall ever regard you as a friend, and in every pray|er I offer up to heaven for my&s;elf, you &s;hall be remem|bered."</P>
<P>"Oh dear, but you &s;hall not impo&s;e upon me &s;o ea|&s;ily: come,'" continued &s;he, turning to a maid, "and help me to conduct this fine lady to the hall door."</P>
<P>"Gracious heaven," &s;aid Amanda, who by this time was taken, or rather dragged, from the bed, "What are you about doing with me? Though I rejoice to quit the hou&s;e, yet &s;urely, &s;urely," &s;he cried, and her &s;oul recoiled at the idea, "without a guide at this hour of the night, you will not turn me from it."</P>
<P>She then mentioned Colonel Belgrave's having de|prived her of her pur&s;e and watch, and be&s;ought the woman, in the mo&s;t pathetic terms, to &s;upply her with a &s;mall &s;um, which &s;he &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ured her &s;hould be returned, as &s;oon as &s;he reached her friends; and end|ed with &s;aying, &s;he &s;hould depart with gratitude and joy, if &s;he complied with her reque&s;t, and allowed &s;ome one to guide her to a place where &s;he might pro|cure a carriage.</P>
<P>"Such madams as you," replied the imperious wo|man, "are never at a lo&s;s for means of procuring mo|ney, or a place to go to: I &s;ee through your art well enough; you want me to pity you, that I may let you &s;tay till your Colonel returns; but who would be fool then, I wonder? the tables, I warrant, would &s;oon be turned upon me: No, no, out you go this moment."</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="038416_0368_1011E4495B326318">
So &s;aying, &s;he rudely &s;eized Amanda, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by another woman, hurried her down &s;tairs, and out of the hou&s;e directly they carried her to an intricate part of the wood, and then ran back, leaving the helple&s;s mourner leaning again&s;t a tree.</P>
<P>Amanda looked around her; dark and awful were the &s;hades of the wood: no light appeared but what came from a few wandering &s;tars, which only &s;erved to render darkne&s;s vi&s;ible. Have mercy upon me, heaven, groaned Amanda, as &s;he felt her&s;elf &s;inking to the earth. The cold acted as a kind of re&s;torative, and al|mo&s;t immediately revived her. She re&s;ted her head again&s;t a little bank, and as &s;he thus reclined, a tender &s;adne&s;s pervaded her &s;oul, at the idea of her father's &s;orrow when he heard of her fate. "When he hears," cried &s;he, "that I was driven from the hou&s;e, as un|worthy of pity or protection from any being; that his Amanda, whom he cheri&s;hed in his bo&s;om as the dar|ling of his age, was denied the pity he would have &s;hewn the greate&s;t wretch that crawls upon the earth; and that &s;he peri&s;hed without &s;helter, it will break his heart en|tirely. Poor O&s;car, too, alas! I &s;hall be a &s;ource of wretchedne&s;s to both. Will Lord Mortimer lament when he hears of my fate? Alas! I cannot believe that he will: he that could leave me in the arms of in&s;en&s;i|bility, and &s;o readily believe ill of me, mu&s;t have a heart &s;teeled again&s;t compa&s;&s;ion for my &s;ufferings. But my unhappy father and brother will never doubt my in|nocence, and by them I &s;hall be tenderly and truly mourned."</P>
<P>The idea of their &s;ufferings, at la&s;t recalled her wan|dering thoughts, and pity for tho&s;e &s;ufferings, made her endeavour to &s;upport her own, that &s;he might be able to make &s;ome efforts for pre&s;erving a life &s;o precious to them: be&s;ides, as &s;he reflected, &s;he could not but attri|but her expul&s;ion from the hou&s;e of infamy, to the im|mediate interpo&s;ition of Providence in her favour; and whil&s;t her heart &s;welled with gratitude at the idea, her fortitude gradually returned. She aro&s;e, but the vigour of her nerves was not equal to the ardour of her intenti|ons:
<PB N="176" REF="038416_0369_1011E44CF43A8F48">
&s;he walked on, and as &s;he proceeded, the gloom grew more profound; the paths were intricate, and her progre&s;s was often impeded by the roots of trees, and the branches that grew about them. After wandering about a con&s;iderable time, &s;he at la&s;t began to think, that in|&s;tead of gaining the &s;kirts, &s;he had penetrated into the very centre of the wood, and that to quit it, till morning, would be impo&s;&s;ible. Yielding to this idea, or rather to her exce&s;&s;ive wearine&s;s, &s;he was &s;eeking for a place to &s;it down on, when a faint light glimmered before her: &s;he in&s;tantly darted through the path from whence it gleam|ed, and found her&s;elf at the extremity of the wood, and that the light proceeded from a &s;mall hamlet contiguous to it. Thither &s;he walked, as fa&s;t as her trembling limbs would carry her. A profound &s;tillne&s;s reigned around, only interrupted by the hoar&s;e and hollow barking of &s;ome di&s;tant dogs, which, in &s;uch an hour, had &s;omething particularly &s;olemn in it. The &s;tillne&s;s, and &s;udden di&s;appearance of lights from various windows, convinced Amanda that every cottage was clo&s;ed for the night; "and were they open," &s;aid &s;he, "I perhaps &s;hould be denied acce&s;s to any, deprived as I am, of the means of rewarding kindne&s;s." She &s;huddered at the idea of pa&s;&s;|ing a night un&s;heltered. "It is now, indeed," &s;aid &s;he, "I really know what it is to feel for the hou&s;ele&s;s chil|dren of want." She moved &s;oftly along; the echo of her own &s;teps alarmed her; &s;he had nearly reached the end of the hamlet, when before a neat cottage, divided from the others by a clump of old trees, &s;he &s;aw a vene|rable man, who might well have pa&s;&s;ed for an ancient hermit; his grey locks thinly &s;haded his forehead; an ex|pre&s;&s;ion of deep and pen&s;ive thought was vi&s;ible in his countenance; his arms were folded on his brea&s;t, and his eyes were rai&s;ed with a tender melancholy to heaven, as if that heaven he contemplated, was now the abode of &s;ome kindred and lamented &s;pirit. Surely &s;uch a being, thought &s;he, will pity me. She approached him&mdash;&s;tood clo&s;e to him, yet was unnoticed. Thrice &s;he attempted to &s;peak, and thrice her heart failed her; at la&s;t &s;he &s;ummoned all her courage to her aid, and faintly articu|lated,
<PB N="177" REF="038416_0370_1011E4503AC6CC78">
"pity&mdash;" &s;he could add no more, but fainted at his feet. The &s;tranger's mind was fraught with all the benevolence his countenance depictured; the tran&s;i|ent glance he had caught of Amanda, intere&s;ted every tender feeling; he called to his &s;ervant, an elderly wo|man, his only companion in the cottage, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in conveying her in. The woman's heart was as tender as her ma&s;ter's, and the youth, the beauty, and forlorn &s;itu|ation of Amanda, equally excited their wonder and pity. It was many minutes ere &s;he opened her eyes, and when &s;he did, her &s;en&s;es were quite bewildered; "and my fa|ther? alas! my father, I &s;hall never more behold him," was all &s;he could articulate.</P>
<P>She was &s;upported to a &s;mall chamber, the old woman undre&s;t her, put her to bed, and &s;at up with her the re|mainder of the night. Amanda often &s;tarted: &s;he raved continually of Belgrave, the author of her woes, and betrayed the &s;tronge&s;t horror. "The wound he had inflicted on her heart," &s;he &s;aid, "the hand of death could only heal." She mentioned the cruelty of the Mar|chione&s;s; called upon her father to &s;ave her from de|&s;truction, and reproached Mortimer for aiding to over|whelm her in di&s;grace. She continued in this &s;ituation three days, during which the old man and his faithful &s;ervant watched her with unremitted attention. A neigh|bouring apothecary was &s;ummoned to her aid, and a girl from one of the cottages procured to &s;it up with her at night. The old man frequently knelt by the bed-&s;ide, watching, with anxiety, for a favourable &s;ymptom. Her incoherent expre&s;&s;ions pierced him to the heart; he felt, from mournful &s;ympathy, for the father &s;he &s;o patheti|cally mentioned, and invoked heaven to re&s;tore her to him.</P>
<P>The afternoon of the third day, Amanda, after a long &s;lumber, awoke, perfectly re&s;tored to her &s;en&s;es; it was many minutes, however, after her awaking, ere &s;he re|collected all the circum&s;tances that had cau&s;ed her pre|&s;ent &s;ituation.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="038416_0371_1011E451CF8A0ED0">
She at la&s;t opened the curtain, and perceived the old woman, whom we &s;hall hereafter call Eleanor, &s;eated by the bed &s;ide.</P>
<P>"I &s;ear," &s;aid &s;he, with a languid &s;mile, "I have been the occa&s;ion of a great deal of trouble."</P>
<P>"No, no," replied the kind Eleanor, delighted to hear her &s;peak &s;o calmly, and drawing back a little of the curtain at the &s;ame time, to ob&s;erve her looks.</P>
<P>Amanda inquired how long &s;he had been ill. Elea|nor informed her, and added, "heaven, my dear child, was kind to you, in throwing you in my ma&s;ter's way, who delights in befriending the helple&s;s."</P>
<P>"Heaven will reward him," exclaimed Amanda."</P>
<P>The chamber was gloomy; &s;he reque&s;ted one of the &s;hutters might be opened. Eleanor complied with her de&s;ire, and a ray of the declining &s;un darting through the ca&s;ement, cheered her pen&s;ive heart.</P>
<P>She perfectly remembered the venerable figure &s;he had beheld on the thre&s;hold of the cottage, and was impati|ent to expre&s;s her gratitude to him. The next day &s;he tru&s;ted, would give her an opportunity of doing &s;o, as &s;he then re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible to ri&s;e. The wi&s;h of her &s;oul was to be with her father. Ere he could receive any intimation of what had happened, &s;he re&s;olved to com|municate to her benevolent ho&s;t, the incident which had placed her in &s;uch a &s;ituation; and &s;he flattered her&s;elf, on hearing them, he would accommodate her with the means of returning to Ireland: if unable (unwilling &s;he could not think &s;he &s;hould find him) to do this, &s;he then intended writing to her father. This mea&s;ure, however, &s;he fervently tru&s;ted, &s;he &s;hould have no occa&s;ion to take, as &s;he well knew the &s;hock &s;uch a letter would give him.</P>
<P>Contrary to the inclinations of Eleanor, &s;he ro&s;e the next day, and as &s;oon as &s;he was dre&s;t, &s;ent to reque&s;t Mr. Howell's company. Eleanor had informed her of her ma&s;ter's name.</P>
<P>The chamber was on a ground floor: before the win|dows were a row of neat white cottages; and behind them ro&s;e a range of lofty hills, covered to the very &s;ummit with trees, now ju&s;t bur&s;ting into verdure be|fore
<PB N="179" REF="038416_0372_1011E4548CE8BFA0">
the cottages ran a clear murmuring rivulet, at which &s;ome young girls were wa&s;hing clothes, whil&s;t others &s;pread them upon hedges, and all beguiled their labour with &s;inging, chatting, and laughing together.</P>
<P>"Ah! happy creatures," cried Amanda, "&s;creened by your native hills, you know nothing of the vices or mi&s;eries of the great world: no &s;nares lurk beneath the flowery paths you tread, to wring your hearts with an|gui&s;h, and nip the early blo&s;&s;oms of your youth."</P>
<P>The old man appeared and interrupted her meditati|ons. When he beheld the pale face of Amanda, beam|ing with angelic &s;weetne&s;s: when he &s;aw her emaciated hand extended towards him, while her &s;oft voice uttered her grateful acknowledgments, his emotions could not be &s;uppre&s;t: he pre&s;t her hand between his: tears rolled down the furrows of his face, and he exclaimed,
"I thank the Almighty for reviving this &s;weet flower."</P>
<P>A deep &s;ob from Amanda, proved how much he had affected her feelings.</P>
<P>He was alarmed, and ha&s;tily endeavoured to compo&s;e his own, out of regard to her's.</P>
<P>When a little compo&s;ed, with grateful &s;weetne&s;s &s;he continued to thank him for his kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>"Pity," &s;aid &s;he, "is a &s;weet emotion to excite; yet from you, without e&s;teem, it would be humiliating; and e&s;teem I cannot flatter my&s;elf with obtaining, till I have accounted for being a wretched wanderer."</P>
<P>She then gave a brief account of her father, and the events of her life.</P>
<P>"Ah! my dear, cried the old man, as &s;he fini&s;hed her narrative, "you have rea&s;on, indeed, to regret your knowledge of Belgrave, but the &s;orrow he has occa&s;ion|ed you, I believe and tru&s;t, will be but tran&s;ient: that which he has given me, will be la&s;ting as my life: you look a&s;toni&s;hed:&mdash;alas! but for him, I might now have been ble&s;t with a daughter as lovely and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> amiable as Fitzalan's.

<P>MANY years are now elap&s;ed &s;ince I took up my re&s;idence in this &s;eque&s;tered hamlet. I retired to it in di&s;ta&s;te with a world, who&s;e vices had robbed me of the deare&s;t trea&s;ure of my heart. Two children cheer|ed my &s;olitude, and in training them up to virtue, I lo&s;t the remembrance of half my cares. My &s;on, when qualified, was &s;ent to Oxford, as a friend had promi&s;ed to provide for him in the church: but my daughter was de&s;tined to retirement, not only from the narrowne&s;s of my income, but from a thorough conviction it was be&s;t calculated to en&s;ure her felicity. Juliana was the child of innocence and content, &s;he knew of no greater hap|pine&s;s than that of promoting mine; of no plea&s;ures but what the hamlet could afford, and was one of the gay|e&s;t as well as the lovelie&s;t of its daughters. One fatal evening I &s;uffered her to go, with &s;ome of her young companions, to a ru&s;tic ball, given by the parents of Belgrave, to their tenants, on coming down to Wood|hou&s;e, from which they had been long ab&s;ent. The graces of my child immediately attracted the notice of their &s;on: though young in years, he was al|ready a profe&s;t libertine: the conduct of his father had &s;et him an example of di&s;&s;ipation, which the volatility of his own di&s;po&s;ition too ready inclined him to follow. His heart immediately conceived the ba&s;e&s;t &s;chemes
<PB N="181" REF="038416_0374_1011E45B70B2B0A8">
again&s;t Juliana, which the ob&s;curity of her &s;ituation prompted him to think might readily be accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>From this period he took every opportunity of thow|ing him&s;elf in her way; my &s;u&s;picions, or rather my fears, were &s;oon excited, for I knew not then the real depravity of Belgrave; but I knew that an attachment between him and my daughter would prove a &s;ource of unea&s;ine&s;s to both, from the di&s;parity fortune had pla|ced between them. My ta&s;k in convincing Juliana of the impropriety of encouraging &s;uch an attachment, was not a difficult one; but alas! I &s;aw the conviction was attended with a pang of angui&s;h, which pierced me to the &s;oul.</P>
<P>Belgrave, from the a&s;&s;umed &s;oftne&s;s and delicacy of his manners, had made an impre&s;&s;ion on her heart, which was not to be era&s;ed; every effort, however, which pru|dence could &s;ugge&s;t, &s;he re&s;olved to make, and in com|pliance with my wi&s;hes avoided Belgrave. This conduct &s;oon convinced him that it would be a difficult matter to lull my caution or betray her innocence; and finding all his attempts to &s;ee, or convey a letter to her, ineffectual, he departed with his parents from Woodhou&s;e.</P>
<P>Juliana heard of his departure with a forced &s;mile, but a &s;tarting tear, and a colourle&s;s cheek, too clearly denoted to me the &s;tate of her mind. I &s;hall not attempt to de&s;cribe my &s;ufferings, on witne&s;&s;ing her's; with my pity was mixed a degree of veneration for that virtue, which in &s;o young a mind could make &s;uch exertions a|gain&s;t a pa&s;&s;ion di&s;approved of by a parent. The evening of his departure, no longer under any re&s;traint, &s;he walked out alone, and in&s;tinctively, perhaps, took the road to Woodhou&s;e. She wandered to its deepe&s;t glooms, and there gave way to emotions, which, from her efforts to &s;uppre&s;s them, were become almo&s;t too painful to &s;upport The gloom of the wood was heightened by the &s;hades of evening, and a &s;olemn &s;tillne&s;s reigned around, well calculated to in&s;pire pen&s;ive tenderne&s;s. She &s;ighed the name of Belgrave in tremulous accents, and lament|ed their ever having in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> A &s;udden ru&s;tling among

the trees &s;tartled her, and the next moment &s;he beheld him at her feet, exclaiming, "We have met, my Juli|ana, never more to part."</P>
<P>Surpri&s;e and confu&s;ion &s;o overpowered her &s;en&s;es, as to render her, for &s;ome time, unable to attend to his raptures. When &s;he grew compo&s;ed, he told her he was returned to make her honourable his; but to effect this intention, a journey from the hamlet was requi&s;ite.</P>
<P>She turned pale at the&s;e words, and declared &s;he ne|ver would con&s;ent to a clande&s;tine mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>This declaration did not di&s;courage Belgrave: he knew the intere&s;t he had in her heart, and this know|ledge gave an energy to his arguments, which gradually undermined the re&s;olution of Juliana. Already, he &s;aid, &s;he had made a &s;ufficient &s;acrifice to filial duty; &s;urely &s;omething was now due to love like his, which, on her account, would cheerfully &s;ubmit to innumerable diffi|culties. As he was under age, a journey to Scotland was unavoidable, he &s;aid, and he would have made me his confidant on the occa&s;ion, but that he feared my &s;crupulous delicacy would have oppo&s;ed his intentions, as contrary to parental authority. He promi&s;ed Juli|ana to bring her back to the hamlet immediately after the ceremony; in &s;hort, the plau&s;ibility of his ar|guments, the tenderne&s;s of his per&s;ua&s;ions, and the &s;e|cret impul&s;es of her heart, at la&s;t produced the effect he wi&s;hed, and he received a promi&s;e from her, to put her&s;elf under his protection that very night.</P>
<P>But oh! how impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe my agonies the en&s;uing morning, when, in&s;tead of my child, I found a letter in her room, informing me of her elopement; they were &s;uch as a parent, trembling for the &s;ame and happi|ne&s;s of his child, may conceive; my &s;en&s;es mu&s;t have &s;unk beneath them, had they long continued; but Bel|grave, according to his promi&s;e, ha&s;tened back my child, and as I &s;at &s;olitary and pen&s;ive in the apartment &s;he &s;o often had enlivened, I &s;uddenly beheld her at my feet, &s;upported by Belgrave, as his wife. So great a tran&s;iti|on from de&s;pair to comfort, was almo&s;t too powerful for me to &s;upport. I a&s;ked my heart, was its pre&s;ent hap|pine&s;s
<PB N="183" REF="038416_0376_1011E45FE07B1810">
real: I knelt, I received my child in my arms: in tho&s;e feeble arms I &s;eemed to rai&s;e her with my heart to heaven in pious gratitude, for her returning un&s;ulli|ed. Yet when my fir&s;t tran&s;ports were abated, I could not help regretting her ever having con&s;ented to a clan|de&s;tine union. I entreated Belgrave to write in the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive manner to his father. He promi&s;ed to comply with my entreaty, yet hinted his fears, that his compliance would be unattended with the &s;ucce&s;s I ho|ped. He reque&s;ted, if this &s;hould be the ca&s;e, I would allow his wife to re&s;ide in the cottage till he was of age. Oh! how plea&s;ing a reque&s;t to my heart: a month pa&s;|&s;ed away in happine&s;s, only allayed by not hearing from his father. At the expiration of that time, he declared he mu&s;t depart, having received orders to join his regi|ment, but promi&s;ed to return as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible: he al&s;o promi&s;ed to write, but a fortnight elap&s;ed, and no letter arrived.</P>
<P>Juliana and I grew alarmed, but it was an alarm that only proceeded from fears of his being ill. We were &s;itting one morning at breakfa&s;t, when the &s;topping of a carriage drew us from the table.</P>
<P>"He is come!" &s;aid Juliana, "he is come!" and &s;he flew to open the door, when, in&s;tead of her expected Belgrave, &s;he beheld his father, who&s;e dark and haugh|ty vi&s;age proclaimed, that he came on no charitable in|tent. Alas! the occa&s;ion of his vi&s;it was too &s;oon ex|plained; he came to have the ties, which bound his &s;on to Juliana, broken. My child, on hearing this, with firmne&s;s declared, that &s;he was convinced any &s;cheme his cruelty might devi&s;e to &s;eparate them, the inte|grity, as well as tenderne&s;s of his &s;on, would render abortive.</P>
<P>"Be not too confident of that, young lady," cried he, &s;miling maliciou&s;ly. He then proceeded to inform her, that that Belgrave, &s;o beloved, and in who&s;e inte|grity &s;he &s;o confided, had him&s;elf authorized his inten|tions, being determined to avail him&s;elf of non-age, to have the marriage broke.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="038416_0377_1011E4616D310010">
Juliana could bear no more; &s;he &s;unk fainting on the bo&s;om of her wretched father. Oh! what a &s;ituation was mine, when, as I cla&s;ped her wildly to my heart, and called upon her to revive, that heart whi&s;pered me, it was cruelty to wi&s;h &s;he &s;hould! Alas! too &s;oon &s;he did, to a keen perception of mi&s;ery. The marriage was di&s;|&s;olved, and health and happine&s;s fled from her together: yet, from compa&s;&s;ion to me, I &s;aw &s;he &s;truggled to &s;up|port the burthen of exi&s;tence. Every remedy which had a chance of prolonging it, I admini&s;tered: but alas! &s;orrow was rooted in her heart, and it was only its re|moval, which was impo&s;&s;ible, that could have effected her recovery. Oh! how often have I &s;tolen from my bed to the door of her apartment, trembling, le&s;t I &s;hould hear the la&s;t groan e&s;cape her lips! how often have I then heard her deep convul&s;ive &s;obs, and re|proached my&s;elf for &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s at the moment, for wi&s;h|ing the continuance of her being, which was only wi&s;h|ing the continuance of her mi&s;ery? Yes, I have then &s;aid, I re&s;ign her, my Creator, unto thee; I re&s;ign her, from a certainty, that only with thee &s;he can enjoy feli|city. But alas! in a moment frail nature has triumphed over &s;uch a re&s;ignation, and pro&s;trate on the ground I have implored heaven, either to &s;pare the child, or take the father along with her.</P>
<P>She &s;aw me unu&s;ually depre&s;t one day, and propo&s;ed a walk, with the hope that any exertion from her might recruit my &s;pirits; but when I &s;aw my child in the very bloom of life, unable to &s;u&s;tain her feeble frame: when I felt her leaning on my almo&s;t nervele&s;s arm for &s;up|port, Oh! how intolerable was the angui&s;h that rived my heart! In vain by &s;oft endearments, &s;he &s;trove to miti|gate it. She motioned to go towards Woodhou&s;e; we had got within &s;ight of the wood, when &s;he complained of fatigue, and &s;at down. She had not been many mi|nutes in this &s;ituation, when &s;he beheld, coming from the wood, Belgrave and a young girl &s;he knew to be the &s;teward's daughter. The familiar manner in which they appeared conver&s;ing, left little room to doubt of the footing on which they were. The hectic glow of Juliana's
<PB N="185" REF="038416_0378_1011E4649CC8AAE8">
complexion, gave place to a deadly palene&s;s; &s;he aro&s;e and returned with me in &s;ilence to the cottage, from whence, in le&s;s than a week, &s;he was borne to her grave.</P>
<P>Eight years, continued he, after a pau&s;e of &s;ome mi|nutes, have elap&s;ed &s;ince her death, yet is her worth, her beauty, and her &s;ufferings &s;till fre&s;h in the remembrance of the inhabitants of the hamlet. In mine, oh! Mi&s;s Fitzalan, how painfully, how plea&s;ingly, do they &s;till exi&s;t: no noi&s;ome weed is allowed to intermingle in the high gra&s;s which has o'ergrown her grave, at the head of which &s;ome kind hand has planted a ro&s;e tree, who&s;e ro&s;es blo&s;&s;om, bloom, and die upon the &s;acred &s;pot. My child is gone before me to that earthly bed, to which I hoped &s;he would have &s;moothed my pa&s;&s;age. Every &s;pot in and about the cottage, continually recall her to my view: the ornaments of this little room, were all the work of that hand, long &s;ince mouldered into du&s;t: in that bed&mdash;he &s;topt, he groaned, and tears bur&s;t from him&mdash;in that bed, re&s;umed he (in a few minutes, though with a broken voice) &s;he breathed her la&s;t &s;igh; in that &s;pot I knelt and received the la&s;t pre&s;&s;ure of her clay cold lips. Of a calm night, when all is hu&s;hed to repo&s;e, I love to con|template that heaven, to which I have given an angel; an angel to whom, I hope, &s;hortly to be re-united; with|out &s;uch a hope, &s;urely, of all men breathing, I &s;hould be the mo&s;t wretched; oh! how cruel is it then in tho&s;e, who, by rai&s;ing doubts of an hereafter, attempt to de|&s;troy &s;uch a hope. Ye &s;ons of error, hide the impious doubts within your hearts, nor with wanton barbarity endeavour to deprive the mi&s;erable of their la&s;t comfort; when this world pre&s;ents nothing but a dreary pro&s;pect, how chearing to the afflicted to reflect on that future one, where all will be bright and happy. When we mourn over the lo&s;t friends of our tendere&s;t affections, on! how con&s;olatory to think we &s;hall be re-united to them again; how often has this thought &s;u&s;pended my tears and &s;lopt my &s;ighs; in&s;pired by it with &s;udden joy, often have I ri&s;en from the cold bed where Juliana lies, and exclaimed, "O death, where is thy &s;ting? O grave, where is thy victory?" both lo&s;t in the certainty of again beholding my child.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="038416_0379_1011E4695CBD8758">
Amanda &s;hed tears of &s;oft compa&s;&s;ion for the fate of Juliana, and the &s;orrows of her father, and felt if po&s;|&s;ible, her gratitude to heaven increa&s;ed, for pre&s;erv|ing her from the &s;nares of &s;uch a mon&s;ter of deceit and barbarity as Belgrave.</P>
<P>Howell relieved the anxiety &s;he laboured under about the means of returning home, by a&s;&s;uring her he would not only &s;upply her with a &s;um &s;ufficient for that pur|po&s;e, but &s;ee her to Parkgate him&s;elf.</P>
<P>His name &s;truck Amanda: it recalled to remem|brance her Welch friend. She inquired, and heard, that the young and tender curate was indeed the &s;on of her benefactor. "The &s;oftne&s;s of Henry's di&s;po&s;ition," &s;aid his father, "particularly qualifies him for the &s;acred function, which prevents his having occa&s;ion to mingle in the concerns of the great world. He writes me word, that he is the &s;imple &s;hepherd of a &s;imple flock."</P>
<P>One day was all Amanda would devote to the purpo&s;e of recruiting her &s;trength; nothing could prevail on her longer to defer her journey. A chai&s;e was accordingly procured, into which, at the fir&s;t dawn of day, &s;he and Howell &s;tept, followed by the ble&s;&s;ings of the affection|ate Eleanor, who, from her own wardrobe, had &s;upplied Amanda with a few nece&s;&s;aries, to take along with her. The church yard lay about a quarter of a mile from the hamlet: it was only divided from the road by a low and broken wall. Old trees, &s;haded the gra&s;s grown graves, and gave a kind of &s;olemn gloomine&s;s to the place.</P>
<P>"See," &s;aid Howell, &s;uddenly taking Amanda's hand and letting down the gla&s;s, "&s;ee the bed where Juliana repo&s;es."</P>
<P>The grave was di&s;tingui&s;hed by the ro&s;e tree at its head: the morning breeze gently agitated the high and luxuriant gra&s;s which covered it. Amanda gazed on it with inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;adne&s;s, but the emotions it excited in her brea&s;t, &s;he endeavoured to check, in pity to the wretched father, who exclaimed, while tears trickled down his pale and furrowed cheeks, "there lies my trea&s;ure."</P>

<P>The weakne&s;s of Amanda would not allow them to travel expeditiou&s;ly. They &s;lept one night on the road, and the next day, to her great joy, arrived at Parkgate, as &s;he had all along dreaded a pur&s;uit from Belgrave. A packet was to &s;ail about four o'clock in the afternoon; &s;he partook of a &s;light repa&s;t with her benevolent friend, who attended her to the boat, and with &s;tarting tears, gave and received an adieu. She promi&s;ed to write as &s;oon as &s;he reached home, and a&s;|&s;ured him his kindne&s;s would never be obliterated from her heart. He watched her till &s;he entered the &s;hip, then returned to the inn, and immediately &s;et off for the hamlet, with a mind &s;omewhat cheered by the con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having &s;erved a fellow creature.</P>

<P>THE weakne&s;s which Amanda felt in con|&s;equence of her late illne&s;s, and the exce&s;&s;ive &s;ickne&s;s &s;he always &s;uffered at &s;ea, made her retire to bed imme|diately on entering the packet, where &s;he continued till evening of the &s;econd day, when about five o'clock, &s;he was landed at the marine hotel. She directly reque&s;ted the waiter to procure her a me&s;&s;enger to go into town, which being done &s;he &s;ent to engage a place in the north|ern mail coach, that went within a few miles of Ca&s;tle Carberry. If a place could not be procured, &s;he order|ed a chai&s;e might be hired, that would immediately &s;et out with her, as the nights were moon light; but to her great joy the man &s;peedily returned, and informed her he had &s;ecured a &s;eat in the coach, which &s;he thought a much &s;afer mode of travelling for her, than in a hired carriage, without any attendant. She took &s;ome &s;light refre&s;hment, and then proceeded to the mail hotel, from whence, at eleven o'clock, &s;he &s;et out, in compa|ny with one old gentleman, who very compo&s;edly put on a large woollen night cap, buttoned up his great coat, and fell into a profound &s;leep; he was, perhaps, ju&s;t &s;uch a kind of companion as Amanda de&s;ired, as he neither teazed her with in&s;ipid conver&s;ation, or im|pertinent que&s;tions, but left her undi&s;turbed, to indulge her meditations during the journey. The &s;econd even|ing, about eight o'clock, &s;he arrived at the neare&s;t town to Ca&s;tle Carberry, for which &s;he directly procu|red a chai&s;e, and &s;et off.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="038416_0382_1011E4718B0E4E98">
Her &s;pirits were painfully agitated: &s;he dreaded the &s;hock her father would receive from hearing of her &s;uf|ferings, which it would be impo&s;&s;ible to conceal from him: &s;he trembled at what they would both feel on the approaching interview; &s;ometimes &s;he feared he had al|ready heard of her di&s;tre&s;s, and a gloomy pre&s;age ro&s;e in her mind, of the angui&s;h &s;he &s;hould find him in on her account: yet again, when &s;he reflected on the forti|tude he had hitherto di&s;played in his trials, under the pre&s;ent, &s;he tru&s;ted, he would not lo&s;e it; and that he would not only &s;upport him&s;elf, but her, and bind up tho&s;e wounds in her heart, which perfidy, cruelty, and ingratitude had made. And oh! thought &s;he to her&s;elf, when I find my&s;elf again in his arms, no temptation &s;hall allure me from them; allure me into a world, where my peace and fame have already &s;uffered &s;uch a wreck. Thus alternately fluctuating between hope and fear, Amanda pur&s;ued the road to Ca&s;tle Carberry; but the latter &s;en&s;ation was predominat in her mind.</P>
<P>The uncommon gloomine&s;s of the evening added to her dejection; the dark and lowering clouds threatened a violent &s;torm; already a &s;hower of &s;leet and rain was falling, and every thing looked cold and cheerle&s;s. A|manda thought the cabins infinitely more wretched than when &s;he had fir&s;t &s;een them; many of their mi&s;erable inhabitants were now gathering their little &s;tock toge|ther, and driving them under &s;helter from the coming &s;torm. The labourers were &s;een ha&s;tening to their re|&s;pective homes, whil&s;t the plough boy, with a low and melancholy whi&s;tle, drove his &s;low and wearied team along. The &s;ea looked rough and black, and as Aman|da drew nearer to it, &s;he heard it breaking with fury again&s;t the rocks.</P>
<P>She felt her&s;elf extremely ill: &s;he had left the hamlet ere her fever was &s;ubdued, and fatigue, joined to want of re&s;t, now brought it back with all its former violence. She longed for re&s;t and quiet, and tru&s;ted and believed the&s;e would conquer her malady.</P>

The chai&s;e &s;topped at the entrance of the lawn, as &s;he wi&s;hed to have her father prepared for her arrival, by one of the &s;ervants. On alighting from it, it re|turned to town, and &s;he &s;truck into a grove, and by a winding path reached the ca&s;tle. Her limbs trembled, and &s;he knocked with an un&s;teady hand at the door. The &s;ound was awfully reverberated through the build|ing: &s;ome minutes elap&s;ed, and no being appeared; neither could &s;he perceive a ray of light from any of the windows; the wind blew the rain directly in her face, and her weakne&s;s increa&s;ed &s;o &s;he could &s;carcely &s;tand. She recollected a &s;mall door at the back of the ca&s;tle, which led to the apartments appropriated to the dome&s;|tics; &s;he walked feebly to this, to try and gain admit|tance, and found it open. She proceeded through a long dark pa&s;&s;age, on each &s;ide of which were &s;mall rooms, till &s;he came to the kitchen; here &s;he found the old woman &s;itting, (to whom the care of the ca&s;tle was u&s;ually con&s;igned) before a large turf fire. On hearing a foot&s;tep &s;he looked behind, and when &s;he &s;aw Aman|da, &s;tarted, &s;creamed, and betrayed &s;ymptoms of the utmo&s;t terror.</P>
<P>"Are you frightened at &s;eeing me, my good Kate?" cried Amanda.</P>
<P>"Oh Holy Virgin," replied Kate, cro&s;&s;ing her brea&s;t, "one could not help being frightened, to have a body &s;teal unawares upon them."</P>
<P>"My father is well, I hope?" &s;aid Amanda.</P>
<P>"Alack a-day," cried Kate, "the poor dear Cap|tain has gone through a &s;ea of troubles &s;ince you went away."</P>
<P>"Is he ill?" exclaimed Amanda.</P>
<P>"Ill, ay, and the Lord knows he has rea&s;on enough to be ill. But, my dear jewel, do you know nothing at all of what has happened at the Ca&s;tle &s;ince you went away?"</P>
<P>"No, nothing in the world."</P>
<P>"Heaven help you then," &s;aid Kate; "but my dear &s;oul, &s;it down upon this little &s;tool, and warm your&s;elf before the fire, for you look pale and cold, and I will tell you all about it. You mu&s;t know, about three weeks

ago my Johnaten brought the Captain a letter from the Po&s;t-office; he knew by the mark it was a letter from England; and &s;o when he comes into the kitchen to me, Kate, &s;ays he, the Captain has got &s;omething now to cheer his &s;pirits, for he has heard from Mi&s;s, I am &s;ure. So to be &s;ure, I &s;aid, I was glad of it, for you mu&s;t know, my dear, he was low in &s;pirits, and peaking, as one may &s;ay, for a few days before. Well, it was al|ways my cu&s;tom, when he got a letter from England, to go to him as &s;oon as I thought he had read it, and a&s;k about you; &s;o I put on a clean apron, and up I goes to the parlour, and opened the door and walked in. "Well, &s;ir," &s;ays I, "I hope there is good news from Mi&s;s?"</P>
<P>"The Captain was &s;itting with the letter open before him on a table; he had a handkerchief to his eyes, but when I &s;poke he took it down, and I &s;aw his face, which generally looked &s;o pale, now quite &s;tu&s;hed."</P>
<P>"This letter, my good Kate," &s;ays he, "is not from my daughter, but I am glad you are come, for I wanted to &s;peak to you. I am going to leave the Ca&s;tle, and I want you to look over all the things, and &s;ee they are in the &s;ame &s;tate as when I came to it; I &s;hall then &s;ettle with the &s;ervants I hired, and di&s;charge them."</P>
<P>I was &s;truck all of a heap; "The Lord forbid you &s;hould be going to leave us, &s;ir," &s;ays I.</P>
<P>"The Captain got up: he walked to the window: he &s;ighed heavily, and I &s;aw a tear upon his cheek. He &s;poke to me again, and begged I would do as he had de|&s;ired me; &s;o with a heavy heart I went and told Johna|ten the &s;ad tidings, who was as &s;orry as my&s;elf, for he loved the Captain dearly, not only from his being &s;o mild a gentleman, but becau&s;e he was a &s;oldier, as he him&s;elf had been in his youth, and a &s;oldier has always a love for one of his cloth; and Johnaten had often &s;aid he knew the captain in America, and that he was a brave officer, and a real gentleman.</P>
<P>"Well, the captain came out to us, and &s;aid he was to be Lord Cherbury's agent no longer; and being a good penman, he &s;ettled all his own accounts, and his &s;er|vants, in the cour&s;e of the day, and di&s;charged them,
<PB N="192" REF="038416_0385_1011E478C80924E8">
giving them both characters, which I warrant will &s;oon get them good places again. Well, he &s;aid he mu&s;t &s;et off for England the next day, &s;o every thing was got ready; but in the middle of the night he was &s;eized with &s;pa&s;ms in his &s;tomach; he thought him&s;elf dying, and at la&s;t rung the bell, and as good luck would have it, my Johnaten heard it, and went up to him directly: had he been without relief much longer, I think he would have died. Johnaten called me up; I had a choice bottle of old brandy lying by me, &s;o I &s;oon blew up a fire, and heating a cup of it, gave it to him directly. He grew a little ea&s;ier, but was too bad in the morning to think of going on his journey, which grieved him &s;adly. He got up, however, and wrote a large pacquet, which he &s;ent by Johnaten to the Po&s;t-office; packed up &s;ome things in a trunk, and put his &s;eal upon his de&s;k: he &s;aid he would not &s;tay in the Ca&s;tle upon any account, &s;o he went out as &s;oon as Johnaten came back from the Po&s;t|Office, leaning upon his arm, and got a little lodging at Thady Bryne's cabin."</P>
<P>"Merciful Heaven!" exclaimed the agonized and almo&s;t fainting Amanda, "&s;upport and &s;trengthen me in this trying hour! enable me to comfort my unfortu|nate father; pre&s;erve me from &s;inking, that I may en|deavour to a&s;&s;i&s;t him:" Tears accompanied this fervent ejaculation, and her voice was lo&s;t in &s;obs.</P>
<P>"Alack-a-day, &s;aid the good-natured Kate, "now don't take it &s;o &s;adly to heart, my jewel, all is not lo&s;t that is in danger, and there is as good fi&s;h in the &s;ea as ever were caught; and what though this is a &s;tormy night, to-morrow may be a fine day. Why, the very fir&s;t &s;ight of you will do the Captain good. Come, cheer up. I will give you &s;ome nice hot potatoes for your &s;up|per, for you &s;ee the pot is ju&s;t boiling, and &s;ome fre&s;h churned butter-milk, and by the time you have eaten it, Johnaten, perhaps, may come back; he is gone to town to get &s;ome beef for our Sunday dinner, and then I will go with you to Thady's my&s;elf."</P>
<P>"No, no," cried Amanda, "every minute I now &s;tay from my father &s;eems an age:&mdash;too long has he been
<PB N="193" REF="038416_0386_1011E47C9F566E30">
neglected:&mdash;too long without a friend to &s;ooth or at|tend him. Oh grant, gracious heaven grant," rai&s;ing her cla&s;ped hands, "that I may not have returned too late to be of u&s;e to him."</P>
<P>Kate pre&s;t her to &s;tay for Johnaten's return; but the agony of &s;u&s;pence &s;he endured till &s;he &s;aw her father, made her regardle&s;s of walking alone, though the hour was late, dark and tempe&s;tuous. Kate finding her en|treaties vain, attended her to the door, a&s;&s;ured her if Johnaten returned &s;oon, &s;he would go over her&s;elf to the cabin, and &s;ee if &s;he could do any thing for her. Amanda pre&s;t her hand, but was unable to &s;peak. Ill, weak and di&s;pirited, &s;he had flattered her&s;elf, on return|ing to her father, &s;he &s;hould receive relief, &s;upport, and con&s;olation; in&s;tead of which, heart-broken as &s;he was, &s;he now found &s;he mu&s;t give, or at lea&s;t attempt giving them, her&s;elf. She had before experienced di&s;tre&s;s, but the actual pre&s;&s;ure of poverty &s;he had never yet felt. Heretofore &s;he had always a comfortable a&s;ylum to re|pair to, but now &s;he not only found her&s;elf deprived of that, but of all means of procuring one, or even the nece&s;&s;aries of life.</P>
<P>But if &s;he mourned for her&s;elf, how much more &s;e|verely did &s;he mourn for her adored father. Could &s;he have procured him comfort: could &s;he, in any degree, have alleviated his &s;ituation, the horrors of her own would have been le&s;&s;ened; but of this &s;he had not the &s;lighte&s;t means or pro&s;pect. Her father, &s;he knew, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the agency too &s;hort a time, to be enabled to &s;ave any mony, particularly as he was indebted to Lord Cherbury ere he obtained it: &s;he knew of no being to whom &s;he could apply in his behalf. Lord Cherbury was the only per&s;on on whom he depended in his form|er misfortunes for relief; his friend&s;hip, it was evi|dent, by depriving her father of the agency, was total|ly lo&s;t; and to the di&s;con&s;olate Amanda, no way ap|peared of e&s;caping "want, worldly want, that hun|gry, meagre fiend," who was already clo&s;e at their heels, and followed them in view.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="038416_0387_1011E47E2CE16CF8">
The violence of the &s;torm had increa&s;ed, but it was &s;light in compari&s;on of that which agitated the bo&s;om of Amanda. The waves da&s;hed with a dreadful noi&s;e again&s;t the rocks, and the angry &s;pirit of the waters roared; the rain fell heavily, and &s;oon &s;oaked through the thin cloathing of Amanda. She had about half a mile to walk through a rugged road, bounded on one &s;ide by rocks, and on the other by wild and dreary fields. She knew the people with whom her father lodged, they were of the lowe&s;t order, and on her fir&s;t arriving at Ca&s;|tle Carberry, in extreme di&s;tre&s;s, from which &s;he had relieved them. She recollected their cabin was more decent than many others &s;he had &s;een, yet &s;till a mo&s;t mi&s;erable dwelling. Wretched as it was, &s;he was glad when &s;he reached it, for the violence of the &s;torm, and the loneline&s;s of the road, had terrified her. The cabin was but a few yards from the beach; there were two windows in front: on one &s;ide a pile of turf, and on the other a &s;hed for the pigs, in which they now lay grunt|ing: the &s;hutters were fa&s;tened on the windows, to pre|vent their being &s;haken by the wind; but through the crevices Amanda &s;aw light, which convinced her the inhabitants were not yet retired to repo&s;e. She feared her &s;uddenly appearing before her father, in his pre&s;ent weak &s;tate, might have a dangerous effect upon him, and &s;he &s;tood before the cabin, con&s;idering how &s;he &s;hould have her arrival broke to him. She at la&s;t tapped gent|ly at the door, and then retreated a few &s;teps from it, &s;hivering with the wet and cold: in the beautiful lan|guage of Solomon &s;he might have &s;aid, "Her head was filled with dew, and her locks with the drops of the night." As &s;he expected, the door was almo&s;t in&s;tantly opened; a boy appeared, whom &s;he knew to be &s;on to the poor people. She held up her handkerchief, and beckoned him to her; he he&s;itated, as if afraid to ad|vance, till &s;he called him &s;oftly by his name; this a&s;&s;ured him; he approached and expre&s;&s;ed a&s;toni&s;hment at find|ing &s;he was the per&s;on who called him. She inquired for her father, and heard he was ill, and then a&s;leep. She de&s;ired the boy to enter the cabin before her, and caution
<PB N="195" REF="038416_0388_1011E480C7BED960">
his parents again&s;t making any noi&s;e that might di&s;|turb him; he obeyed her and &s;he followed him.</P>
<P>She found the father of the family blowing a turf fire, to ha&s;ten the boiling of a large pot of potatoes. Three ragged children were &s;itting before it, watching impatiently for their &s;upper. Their mother was &s;pin|ning, and their old grandmother making bread. The place was &s;mall and crowded; half the family &s;lept be|low, and the other half upon a loft, to which they a&s;|cended by a ladder, and upon which a number of fowls were now familiarly roo&s;ting, cackling at every noi&s;e made below. Fitzalan's room was divided from the re&s;t of the cabin by a thin partition of wood, plai&s;ter|ed with pictures of &s;aints and cro&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>"Save you kindly, madam," &s;aid the mi&s;tre&s;s of the man&s;ion to Amanda, on entering it.</P>
<P>Bryne got up, and with many &s;crapes, offered her his little &s;tool before the fire. She thanked him, and accepted it; his wife, notwith&s;tanding the obligations &s;he lay under to her, &s;eemed to think as much re&s;pect was not due to her as when mi&s;tre&s;s of the ca&s;tle, and therefore never left her &s;eat, or quitted her &s;pinning, on her entrance.</P>
<P>"My poor father is very ill," &s;aid Amanda.</P>
<P>"Why, indeed the captain has had a bad time of it," an&s;wered Mrs. Bryne, jogging her wheel; "to be &s;ure he has &s;uffered &s;ome little change; but your great folks, as well as your &s;imple folks, mu&s;t look to that in this world; and I don't know why they &s;hould not, for they are no better than the others, I believe."</P>
<P>"Arra, Norah, now," &s;aid Bryne, "I wonder you are not &s;hy of &s;peaking &s;o to the poor young lady."</P>
<P>Amanda's heart was &s;urcharged with grief; &s;he felt &s;uffocating; &s;he aro&s;e, unlatched the door, and the keen cold air a little revived her. Tears bur&s;t forth, &s;he indulged them freely, and they lightened the load on her heart. She a&s;ked for a gla&s;s of water; a gla&s;s was not readily to be procured. Bryne told her &s;he had better take a noggin of butter-milk. This &s;he refu|&s;ed and he brought her one of water.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="038416_0389_1011E482C6E6E438">
She now conquered the reluctance &s;he felt to &s;peak to the uncouth Mrs. Bryne, and con&s;ulted her on the be&s;t method of mentioning her arrival to her father. Mrs. Bryne &s;aid he had been in bed &s;ome time, but his &s;leep was often interrupted, and &s;he would now &s;tep into his chamber, and try if he was awake; &s;he accordingly did &s;o, but returned in a moment, and &s;aid he &s;till &s;lept.</P>
<P>Amanda wi&s;hed to &s;ee him in his pre&s;ent &s;ituation, to judge how far his illne&s;s had affected him; &s;he &s;tept &s;oftly into his room; it was &s;mall and low, lighted by a glimmering ru&s;h-light, and a declining fire. The fur|niture was poor and &s;canty; in one corner &s;tood a wood|en bed&s;tead, without curtains, or any &s;hade, and on this, under mi&s;erable bed clothes, lay poor Fitzalan.</P>
<P>Amanda &s;huddered as &s;he looked round this chamber of wretchedne&s;s. "Oh, my father," &s;he cried to her|&s;elf, "is this the only refuge you could find." She went to the bed, &s;he leaned over it, and beheld his face; it was deadly pale and emaciated: he moaned in his &s;leep, as if his mind was dreadfully oppre&s;t. Suddenly he began to move; he &s;ighed&mdash;"Amanda, my deare&s;t child, &s;hall I never more behold you?"</P>
<P>Amanda was obliged to ha&s;ten from the room, to give vent to her emotions: &s;he &s;obbed, &s;he wrung her hands, and in the bitterne&s;s of her &s;oul exclaimed, "Alas! alas! I have returned too late to &s;ave him."</P>
<P>They &s;oon after heard him &s;tir. She reque&s;ted Mrs. Bryne to go in, and cautiou&s;ly inform him &s;he was come. She complied, and in a moment Amanda heard him &s;ay, "Thank heaven, my darling is returned."</P>
<P>"You may now go in, Mi&s;s," &s;aid Mrs. Bryne, coming from the room.</P>
<P>Amanda went in; her father was rai&s;ed in the bed; his arms were extended to receive her; &s;he threw her|&s;elf into them; language was denied them both, but tears, even more expre&s;&s;ive than words, evinced their feelings. Fitzalan fir&s;t recovered his voice, "My pray|er," &s;aid he, is granted; heaven has re&s;tored my child,
<PB N="197" REF="038416_0390_1011E4866EE83D60">
to &s;mooth the pillow of &s;ickne&s;s, and &s;ooth the la&s;t mo|ments of exi&s;tence."</P>
<P>"Oh! my father," cried Amanda, "have pity on me, and mention not tho&s;e moments; exert your&s;elf for your child; who in this wide world, has &s;he but thee to comfort, &s;upport and befriend her?"</P>
<P>"Indeed," &s;aid he, "for your &s;ake I wi&s;h they may be far di&s;tant."</P>
<P>He held her at a little di&s;tance from him; he &s;urvey|ed her face, her form; her altered complexion, her fal|len features, appeared to &s;hock him; he cla&s;ped her again to his bo&s;om. "The world, my child, I fear," cried he, "has u&s;ed thee mo&s;t unkindly."</P>
<P>"Oh! mo&s;t cruelly," &s;obbed Amanda.</P>
<P>"Then, my girl, let the reflection of that world, where innocence and virtue will meet a proper reward, con&s;ole you:&mdash;Here they are often permitted to be tried; but as gold is tried and purified by fire, &s;o are they by adver&s;ity. "Tho&s;e whom God loves, he cha&s;ti&s;es."&mdash;Let this idea give you patience and fortitude, under eve|ry trial; never forego your dependence on him, though calamity &s;hould pur&s;ue you to the very brink of the grave; but be comforted by the a&s;&s;urance he has given, that tho&s;e who meekly bear the cro&s;s he lays upon them, &s;hall be rewarded: that he will wipe away all tears from their eyes, and &s;wallow up death in victory.</P>
<P>"Though a &s;oldier from my youth, and accu&s;tomed to all the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of camps, I never forgot my Creator, and I now find the benefit of not having done &s;o; now when my friends de&s;ert, the world frowns up|on me; when &s;ickne&s;s and &s;orrow have overwhelmed me, religion &s;tands me in good &s;tead; con&s;oles me for what I lo&s;t, and &s;oftens the remembrance of the pa&s;t, by pre&s;enting pro&s;pects of future brightne&s;s."</P>
<P>So &s;poke Fitzalan the pious &s;entiments of his &s;oul and they calmed the agitations of Amanda. He found her clothes were wet, and in&s;i&s;ted on her changing them di|rectly. In the bundle the good Eleanor gave her, was a change of linen, and a cotton wrapper, which &s;he now put on, in a &s;mall clo&s;et, or rather &s;hed, adjoining her

father's room. A good fire was made up, a better light brought in, and &s;ome bread and wine from a &s;mall cup|board in the room, which contained Fitzalan's things, &s;et before her, of which he made her immediately par|take. He took a gla&s;s of wine him&s;elf from her, and tried to cheer her &s;pirits. "He had been daily expect|ing her arrival," he &s;aid, "and had had a pallet and bed clothes kept airing for her; he hoped &s;he would not be di&s;&s;atisfied with &s;leeping in the clo&s;et."</P>
<P>"Ah! my father," &s;he cried, "can you a&s;k your daughter &s;uch a que&s;tion?" She expre&s;t her fears of in|juring him, by having di&s;turbed his repo&s;e. "No," he &s;aid, "it was a delightful interruption; it was a relief from pain and anxiety."</P>
<P>"Lord Cherbury," he informed her, had written him a letter, which pierced him to the &s;oul. He accu&s;ed me," &s;aid he, "of endeavouring to promote a marriage between you and Lord Mortimer: of treacherou&s;ly try|ing to counteract his views, and take advantage of his un&s;u&s;pecting friend&s;hip. I was &s;hocked at the&s;e accu&s;a|tions, but how excrutiating would my angui&s;h have been had I really de&s;erved them. I &s;oon determined upon the conduct I &s;hould adopt, which was to deny the ju&s;tice of his charges, and re&s;ign his agency; for any farther deal|ings with a man, who could think me capable of mean|ne&s;s or duplicity, was not to be thought of. My accounts were always in a &s;tate to allow me to re&s;ign at a mo|ment's warning. It was my intention to go to England, put them into Lord Cherbury's hands, and take my A|manda from a place, where &s;he might meet with indig|nities as little merited by her, as tho&s;e her father had received, were by him. A &s;udden and dreadful di&s;or|der, which I am convinced the agitation of my mind brought on, prevented my executing this intention. I wrote however, to his lord&s;hip, acquainting him with my re&s;ignation of his agency, and tran&s;mitting my accounts and arrears. I &s;ent a letter to you at the &s;ame time, with a &s;mall remittance, for your immediate return, and then retired from the Ca&s;tle, for I felt a longer continu|ance in it, would degrade me to the character of a mean

dependant, and intimate a hope of being re-in&s;tated in my former &s;tation; which, &s;hould Lord Cherbury now offer I &s;hould reject, for ignoble mu&s;t be the mind which could accept of favours from tho&s;e who doubted its in|tegrity. Again&s;t &s;uch conduct my feelings revolt; poverty, to me, is mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e welcome than independence, when purcha&s;ed with the lo&s;s of &s;elf-e&s;teem."</P>
<P>Amanda perceived her father knew nothing of her &s;ufferings, but &s;uppo&s;ed her return occa&s;ioned by his let|ter; &s;he therefore re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, not to undeceive him, at lea&s;t till his health was better.</P>
<P>The night was far advanced, and her father who &s;aw her ill, and almo&s;t &s;inking with fatigue, reque&s;ted her to retire to re&s;t; &s;he accordingly did. Her bed was made up in the little clo&s;et; Mrs. Bryne a&s;&s;i&s;ted her to un|dre&s;s, and brought her a bowl of whey, which &s;he tru&s;t|ed, with a comfortable &s;leep, would carry off her feveri&s;h &s;ymptoms, and enable her to be her father's nur&s;e.</P>
<P>Her re&s;t, however, was far from being comfortable; it was broken by horrid dreams, in which &s;he beheld the pale and emaciated figure of her father, &s;uffering the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite tortures: and when &s;he &s;tarted from the&s;e dreams, &s;he heard his deep moans, which were like dag|gers going through her heart. She aro&s;e once or twice, &s;uppo&s;ing him in pain; but when &s;he went to his bed, &s;he found him a&s;leep, and was convinced, from that cir|cum&s;tance, his pain was more of the mental than the bodily kind. She felt extremely ill; her bones were &s;ore from the violent motion of the carriage, and &s;he fancied re&s;t would do her good; but when, towards morning, &s;he was inclined to take &s;ome, &s;he was com|pletely prevented by the noi&s;e the children made on ri&s;|ing. Fearful of neglecting her father, &s;he aro&s;e &s;oon after her&s;elf, but was &s;carcely able to put on her clothes, from exce&s;&s;ive weakne&s;s. She found him in bed, but awake. He welcomed her with a languid &s;mile, and extending his hand, which was reduced to mere &s;kin and bone, &s;aid, "that joy was a greater enemy to repo&s;e than grief, and had broken his earlier than u&s;ual that morning."</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="038416_0393_1011E4BBBAE72D88">
He made her &s;it down by him: he gazed on her with unutterable tenderne&s;s: "in divine language," cried he, "I may &s;ay, let me &s;ee thy countenance; let me hear thy voice: but &s;weet is thy voice, and thy counte|nance is comely, and my &s;oul has plea&s;ure in gazing on it."</P>
<P>The kettle was already boiling; he had procured a few nece&s;&s;aries for him&s;elf, &s;uch as tea-things and gla&s;&s;es. Amanda placed the tea-table by the bed &s;ide, and gave him his breakfa&s;t. Whil&s;t receiving it from her, his eyes were rai&s;ed to heaven, as if in thankful gratitude for the ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ing he &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in &s;uch a child. After breakfa&s;t, he &s;aid he would ri&s;e, and Amanda retired into the garden till he was dre&s;t, if that could de&s;erve the appellation, which was only a &s;lip of ground, planted with cabbages and potatoes, and en|clo&s;ed with loo&s;e &s;tones and blackberry bu&s;hes. The &s;pring was already advanced; the day was fine: the light and fleecy clouds were gradually di&s;per&s;ing, and the &s;ky, almo&s;t as far as the eye could reach, was of a clear blue. The du&s;ky green of the blackberry bu&s;hes, was enliven|ed by the pale purple of their blo&s;&s;oms; tufts of prim|ro&s;es grew beneath their &s;helter; the fields, which ro&s;e with a gentle &s;well above the garden, were covered with a vivid green, &s;pangled with dai&s;ies, buttercups, and wild honey-&s;uckles; and the birds, as they fluttered from &s;pray to &s;pray, with notes of gladne&s;s hailed the genial &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>But neither the &s;ea&s;on, nor its charms, could now, as heretofore, delight Amanda; &s;he felt forlorn and di&s;|con&s;olate; deprived of the comforts of life, and no longer intere&s;ted in the objects about her, &s;he &s;at down upon a &s;tone at the end of the garden, and &s;he thought the fre&s;h breeze from the &s;ea cooled the feeveri&s;h heat of her blood. "Alas!" &s;he &s;aid to her&s;elf, at this &s;ea&s;on la&s;t year, how different was my &s;ituation from the pre&s;ent; though not in affluence, neither was &s;he then in ab&s;olute di&s;|tre&s;s; and &s;he had be&s;ides the comfortable hope of hav|ing her father's difficulties removed; like Burn's moun|tain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, &s;he had then cheerfully glinted forth amid&s;t

the &s;torm, becau&s;e &s;he thought that &s;torm would &s;oon be o'erblown; but now &s;he &s;aw her&s;elf on the point of be|ing finally cru&s;hed beneath the rude pre&s;&s;ure of poverty."</P>
<P>She recollected the words which had e&s;caped her when &s;he la&s;t &s;aw Tudor Hall, and &s;he thought they were dic|tated by &s;omething like a prophetic &s;pirit. She had then &s;aid, as &s;he leaned upon a little gate which looked into the domain, "when the&s;e woods again glow with ve|getation; when every &s;hade re&s;ounds with harmony, and the flowers and the blo&s;&s;oms &s;pread their foliage to the &s;un, ah! ah where will Amanda be? far di&s;tant, in all probability, from the&s;e delightful &s;hades; perhaps de|&s;erted and forgotten by their ma&s;ter."</P>
<P>She was indeed far di&s;tant from them; de&s;erted, and if not forgotten, at lea&s;t only remembered with con|tempt by their ma&s;ter; remembered with contempt by Lord Mortimer. It was an idea of intolerable angui&s;h; his name was no more repeated as a charm to &s;ooth her grief; his idea increa&s;ed her mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>She continued indulging her melancholy meditations, till informed by one of the children, the Captain was ready to receive her. She ha&s;tened in, and found him in an old high-backed chair, and the ravages of care and &s;ickne&s;s were now more vi&s;ible to her than they had been the night before: he was reduced to a mere &s;kele|ton; "the original brightne&s;s of his form" was quite gone, and he &s;eemed already on the very brink of the grave. The agony of Amanda's feelings was expre&s;t on her countenance: he perceived and gue&s;t its &s;ource. He endeavoured to compo&s;e and comfort her. She men|tioned a phy&s;ician; he tried to di&s;&s;uade her from the idea of bringing one, but &s;he be&s;ought him, in compa&s;|&s;ion to her, to con&s;ent, and overcome by her earne&s;t|ne&s;s, he at la&s;t promi&s;ed the en&s;uing day &s;he &s;hould do as &s;he wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>It was now Sunday, and he de&s;ired the &s;ervice of the lay to be read. A &s;mall bible lay on the table before him, and Amanda complied with his de&s;ire. In the fir&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;&s;on were the&s;e words: "Leave t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">therle&s;s chil|dren

to me, and I will be their father." The tears gu&s;hed from Fitzalan; he laid his hand, which appeared convul&s;ed with agitation, on the book. "Oh! what words of comfort," cried he, "are the&s;e; what tran&s;|port do they convey to the heart of a parent burthened with anxiety?&mdash;yes, merciful power, I will, with grate|ful joy, commit my children to thy care, for thou art the friend who will never for&s;ake them." He de&s;ired Amanda to proceed; her voice was weak and broken, and the tears, in &s;pite of her efforts to re&s;train them, &s;tole down her cheeks.</P>
<P>When &s;he had concluded, her father drew her towards him, and inquired into all that had pa&s;t during her &s;tay in London. She related to him, without re&s;erve, the va|rious incidents &s;he had met with, previous to her going to the Marchione&s;s's; acknowledged the hopes and fears &s;he experienced on Lord Mortimer's account, and the arguments he had made u&s;e of, to induce her to a cla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|de&s;tine union, with her po&s;itive refu&s;al to &s;uch a &s;tep.</P>
<P>A beam of plea&s;ure illumined the pallid face of Fitz|alan; "you acted," &s;aid he, "as I expected, and I glory in my child, and feel more indignation than ever again&s;t Lord Cherbury, for his mean &s;u&s;picions." Amanda was convinced tho&s;e &s;u&s;picions had been infu&s;ed into his mind by tho&s;e who had &s;truck at her peace and fame. This idea, however, as well as their injuries to her, &s;he meant, if po&s;&s;ible, to conceal. When her father, therefore, de&s;ired her to proceed in her narrative, her voice began to faulter, her mind became di&s;turbed, and her counte|nance betrayed her agitation. The remembrance of the dreadful &s;cenes &s;he had gone through at the Marchion|e&s;s's, made her involuntarily &s;hudder, and &s;he wi&s;hed to conceal them for ever from her father, but found it impo&s;&s;ible to evade his minute and earne&s;t inquiries.</P>
<P>"Gracious heaven," &s;aid he, on hearing them, "what complicated cruelty and deceit! inhuman mon&s;ters! to have no pity on one &s;o young, &s;o innocent, &s;o helple&s;s; the hand of &s;orrow has indeed pre&s;t heavy on thee my child; but after the Marchione&s;s's former conduct, I cannot be &s;urpri&s;ed at any action of her's</P>

He gave her a note to di&s;charge her debt to Howell, and begged &s;he would immediately write, and return his grateful acknowledgments for his benevolence. She feared he inconvenienced him&s;elf by parting with the note, but he a&s;&s;ured her he could &s;pare it extremely well, as he had been an economi&s;t, and had &s;till &s;uffici|ent money to &s;upport them a few months longer in their pre&s;ent &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Amanda now enquired when he had heard from her brother; &s;he &s;aid he had not an&s;wered her la&s;t letter, and that his &s;ilence had made her very unea&s;y.</P>
<P>"Alas! poor O&s;car," exclaimed Fitzalan, "he has not been exempt from his portion of di&s;tre&s;s."</P>
<P>He took a letter, as he &s;poke, from his pocket book, and pre&s;ented it to Amanda. She opened it with a trembling hand, and read as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Father,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Particular circum&s;tances prevented my an&s;wering your la&s;t letter as &s;oon as I could have wi&s;hed; and indeed, the intelligence I have to communicate, makes me al|mo&s;t aver&s;e to write at all. As my &s;ituation, however, mu&s;t &s;ooner or later be known to you, I think it better to inform you of it my&s;elf, as I can, at the &s;ame time, reconcile you, I tru&s;t, in &s;ome degree to it, by a&s;&s;uring you I bear it patiently, and that it has not been cau&s;ed by any action which can degrade my character, as a man or a &s;oldier. I have long, indeed, had a powerful enemy to cope with, and it will not doubt, &s;urpri&s;e you to hear, that that enemy is Colonel Belgrave. An interference in the cau&s;e of humanity provoked his in&s;olence and ma|lignity; neither his words nor looks were bearable, and I was irritated by them to &s;end him a challenge; had I reflected, the probable con&s;equences of &s;uch a &s;tep mu&s;t have occurred, and prevented my taking it; but pa&s;&s;ion blinded my rea&s;on, and in yielding to its dictates, do I hold my&s;elf alone culpable throughout the whole affair. I gave him the opportunity his malicious heart had long de&s;ired, of working my ruin. I was, by his order, put under an immediate arre&s;t. A court martial was held,
<PB N="204" REF="038416_0397_1011E4914FBB4860">
and I was broke, for di&s;re&s;pect to a &s;uperior officer; but it was imagined by the whole corps, I &s;hould have been re&s;tored. I however knew too much of Belgrave's di&s;|po&s;ition, to believe this would be the ca&s;e; but never &s;hall he triumph in the di&s;tre&s;s he has cau&s;ed, by wit|ne&s;&s;ing it. I have already &s;ettled on the cour&s;e I &s;hall pur&s;ue, and ere this letter reaches you, I &s;hall have quit|ted my native kingdom. Forgive me, my dear Sir, for not con&s;ulting you relative to my conduct; but I feared, if I did, your tenderne&s;s would interfere to prevent it, or lead you to di&s;tre&s;s your&s;elf on my account; and to think that you, and my dear &s;i&s;ter, were deprived of the &s;malle&s;t comfort by my means, would be a &s;ource of in|tolerable angui&s;h to me. Ble&s;t as I am with youth, health and fortitude, I have no doubt but I &s;hall make my way through the rugged path of life extremely well. A parting vi&s;it I avoided, from the certainty of its being painful for us both. I &s;hall write as &s;oon as I reach my place of de&s;tination. I rejoice to hear Amanda is &s;o happily &s;ituated with Lady Grey&s;tock; may your &s;uffer|ing and her merit be rewarded as they de&s;erve. Suffer not, I entreat, too tender an anxiety for my intere&s;t to di&s;turb your repo&s;e. I again repeat I have no doubt but what I &s;hall do well; that Providence in which I tru&s;t, will, I humbly hope, &s;upport me through every diffi|culty, and again unite me to the friends &s;o valua|ble to my heart. Farewell, my dear father, and be a&s;&s;ured, with unabated re&s;pect and gratitude, I &s;ubjoin my&s;elf your affectionate &s;on,</P>

<P>This letter was a cruel &s;hock to Amanda; &s;he hoped to have procured her brother's company and that her father's melancholy, and her own would have been al|leviated by it. Sen&s;ible of the difficulties O&s;car mu&s;t undergo, without friends or fortune, the tears &s;tole down her ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eks, and &s;he almo&s;t dreaded &s;he could no more behold him.</P>
<P>Her father be&s;ought her to &s;pare him the mi&s;ery of &s;eeing tho&s;e tears; he leaned upon her for comfort and
<PB N="205" REF="038416_0398_1011E495065C76B8">
&s;upport, he &s;aid, and bid her not di&s;appoint him. She ha&s;tily wiped away her tears; and though &s;he could not conquer, tried to &s;uppre&s;s her angui&s;h.</P>
<P>Johnaten and Kate called in the cour&s;e of the day, to know if they could be of any &s;ervice to Fitzalan. A|manda engaged Johnaten to go to town the next morn|ing for a phy&s;ician, and gave Kate the key of a ward|robe, where &s;he had left &s;ome things, which &s;he de&s;ired her to pack up, and &s;end to the cabin in the evening.&mdash;Mrs. Bryne gave them one of her fowls for dinner, and Fitzalan a&s;&s;umed an appearance of cheerfulne&s;s, and the evening wore away &s;omewhat better than the preceding part of the day had done.</P>
<P>Johnaten was punctual in obeying Amanda's com|mands, and brought a phy&s;ician the next morning to the cabin. Fitzalan appeared much wor&s;e, and Aman|da rejoiced that &s;he had been re&s;olute in procuring him advice.</P>
<P>She withdrew from the room &s;oon after the phy&s;ician had entered it, and waited without in trembling anxiety for his appearance.</P>
<P>When he came out, &s;he a&s;ked, with a faultering voice, his opinion, and be&s;ought him not to deceive her, from pity to her feelings.</P>
<P>He &s;hook his head, and a&s;&s;ured her he would not devi|ate from truth for the world; "The Captain was, in|deed, in a tickli&s;h &s;ituation," he &s;aid, "but the medi|cines he had ordered, and &s;ea bathing, he doubted not would &s;et all to rights; it was fortunate," he added, "&s;he delayed no longer &s;ending for him;" mentioned twenty miraculous cures he had performed: admired the immen&s;e fine pro&s;pect before the door, and wi&s;hed her good morning, with what he thought quite a degagee, and irre&s;i&s;tible air.</P>
<P>She was willing to believe his a&s;&s;urances of her fa|ther's recovery, as the drowning wretch will gra&s;p at every &s;traw: &s;he eage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y embraced the &s;hadow of com|fort, and in the recovery of her father, looked forward to con&s;olation for all her &s;orrows. She &s;truggled again&s;t her own illne&s;s, that no a&s;&s;iduous attention might be

wanting to him; and would have &s;at up with him at night, had he not po&s;itively in&s;i&s;ted on her going to bed.</P>
<P>The medicines he was ordered, he received from her hands, but with a look which &s;eemed to expre&s;s his con|viction of their inefficacy. All, however, &s;he wi&s;hed him to do, he did, and often rai&s;ed his eyes to heaven, as to implore it to reward her care, and yet a little longer &s;pare him to this beloved child, who&s;e happine&s;s &s;o much de|pended on the prolongation of his exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Four days pa&s;t heavily away, and the a&s;&s;urances of the phy&s;ician, who was punctual in his attendance, lo&s;t their effect upon Amanda.</P>
<P>Her father was con&s;iderably altered for the wor&s;e, and unable to ri&s;e, except for a few minutes in the evening, to have his bed made. He complained of no pain or &s;ickne&s;s, but &s;eemed &s;inking beneath an ea&s;y and gradual decay. It was only at intervals he could conver&s;e with his daughter. His conver&s;ation was then calculated to &s;trengthen her fortitude and re&s;ignation, and prepare her for an approaching melancholy event. Whenever &s;he received a hint of it, her agony was inexpre&s;&s;ible; but pity for her feelings could not prevent her father from u&s;ing every opportunity that occurred, for laying down rules and precepts, which might be &s;erviceable to her when without a guide or protector. Sometimes he ad|verted to the pa&s;t, but this was only done to make her more cautious of the future.</P>
<P>He charged her to avoid any further intimacy with Lord Mortimer, as an e&s;&s;ential mea&s;ure for the re&s;tora|tion of her peace, and pre&s;ervation of her fame, and the removal of Lord Cherbury's unju&s;t &s;u&s;picions, who will find, at la&s;t, continued he, how much he wronged me, and may, perhaps, feel compunction, when beyond his power to make reparation.</P>
<P>To all he de&s;ired, Amanda promi&s;ed a religious ob|&s;ervance; &s;he thought it unnece&s;&s;ary in him, indeed, to de&s;ire her to avoid Lord Mortimer, convinced as &s;he was, that he had utterly abandoned her; but the grief this de&s;ertion occa&s;ioned, &s;he believed, &s;he &s;hould &s;oon over|come, was her father once re&s;tored to health, for then
<PB N="207" REF="038416_0400_1011E4994D352638">
&s;he would have no time for u&s;ele&s;s regrets or retro&s;pec|tions, but be obliged to pa&s;s every hour in active exer|tions for his &s;upport and comfort.</P>
<P>A week pa&s;t away in this manner at the cabin: a week of wretchedne&s;s to Amanda, who perceived her father growing weaker and weaker.</P>
<P>She a&s;&s;i&s;ted him, as u&s;ual, to ri&s;e one evening, for a few minutes; when dre&s;t, he complained of an oppre&s;|&s;ion in his breathing, and de&s;ired to be &s;upported to the air. Amanda, with difficulty, led him to the window, which &s;he opened, and &s;eated him by it; then knelt be|fore him, and putting her arms round his wai&s;t, fa&s;ten|ed her eyes with anxious tenderne&s;s upon his face.</P>
<P>The evening was &s;erenely fine; the &s;un was &s;etting in all its glory, and the &s;ea, illumined by its parting beams, looked like a &s;heet of burni&s;hed &s;ilver.</P>
<P>"What a lovely &s;cene," cried Fitzalan, faintly, "with what maje&s;ty does the &s;un retire from the world: the calmne&s;s which attends its departure is &s;uch, I think, as mu&s;t attend the exit of a good man."</P>
<P>He pau&s;ed for a few minutes, then rai&s;ing his eyes to heaven, exclaimed, "Merciful power! had it plea&s;ed thee, I could have wi&s;hed yet a little longer to have been &s;pared to this young creature; but thy will, not mine, be done; confiding in thy mercy, I leave her with &s;ome degree of fortitude.</P>
<P>Amanda's tears began to flow as he &s;poke; he rai&s;|ed his hand on which they fell, and ki&s;&s;ing them off, exclaimed, "Precious drops: my Amanda, weep not too bitterly for me; like a weary traveller, think that re&s;t mu&s;t now be acceptable to me."</P>
<P>She interrupted him, and conjured him to change the di&s;cour&s;e. He &s;hook his head mournfully; pre&s;t her hands between his, and &s;aid,</P>
<P>"Yet a little longer, my child, bear with it;" then bid her a&s;&s;ure her brother, whenever they met, which he tru&s;ted and believed would be &s;oon, he had his fa|ther's ble&s;&s;ing; "the only legacy," he cried, "I can leave him: but one, I am cofident, he merits, and will value; to you, my girl, I have no doubt he will prove
<PB N="208" REF="038416_0401_1011E49D0EA47960">
a friend and guardian; you may both, perhaps, be amply recompen&s;ed for all your &s;orrows. Providence is ju&s;t in all its dealings, and may yet render the lovely offspring of my Malvina truly happy."</P>
<P>He appeared exhau&s;ted by &s;peaking, and Amanda a&s;&s;i&s;ted him to lie down, entreating him, at the &s;ame time to take &s;ome drops. He con&s;ented, and while &s;he was pouring them out at a little table, her back to the bed, &s;he heard a deep groan: the bottle dropt from her hand, &s;he &s;prang to the bed, and perceived her fa|ther lying &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the pillow. She imagined he had fainted, and &s;creamed out for a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The woman of the cabin, her hu&s;band and mother, all ru&s;hed into the room; he was rai&s;ed up, his temples and hands chafed, and every remedy within the hou&s;e applied, for his recovery&mdash;but in vain&mdash;his &s;pirit had for&s;aken its tenement of clay forever.</P>
<P>Amanda, when convinced of this, wrung her hands together, then &s;uddenly opening them, &s;he cla&s;ped the lifele&s;s body to her brea&s;t, and &s;unk fainting be&s;ide it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>SHE remained a con&s;iderable time in a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility, and, when recovered, &s;he found her&s;elf in a bed lain upon the floor, in a corner of the out&s;ide room; her &s;en&s;es were at fir&s;t confu&s;ed, &s;he felt as if waking from a di&s;agreeable dream, but in a few minutes a perfect recollection of what had pa&s;t returned, &s;he &s;aw &s;ome one &s;itting by the bed; &s;he rai&s;ed her&s;elf a little, and perceived &s;i&s;ter Mary: "This is indeed a charitable vi&s;it," cried &s;he, extending her hand, and &s;peaking in a low broken voice. The good natured nun jumped from her &s;eat on hearing her &s;peak, and embraced her mo&s;t tenderly. Her care&s;&s;es affected Amanda inexpre&s;&s;ibly: &s;he dropped her head upon her brea&s;t and wept with a vehemence which relieved the oppre&s;&s;ion of her heart.</P>
<P>Si&s;ter Mary &s;aid, &s;he had never heard of her return to the country till Mrs. Bryne came to St. Catherine's for a few &s;prigs of Ro&s;emary to &s;trew over the poor Captain; &s;he had returned with her then to the cabin to try if &s;he could be of any &s;ervice, and to invite her, in the name of the priore&s;s and the whole &s;i&s;terhood, to the convent.</P>
<P>Amanda thanked her for her kind invitation, which, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he mu&s;t decline accepting for a few days, till &s;he had performed all her duties, which, in a voice half &s;tifled by &s;obs, &s;he added, "the grave would &s;oon termi|nate; &s;he was &s;orry," &s;he &s;aid, "that they had undre&s;&s;|ed
<PB N="4" REF="038416_0404_1011E4A550DBEEE8">
her, and reque&s;ted &s;i&s;ter Mary to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in putting on her clothes." The &s;i&s;ter tried to di&s;&s;uade her from this, but &s;oon found &s;he was determined to &s;pend the re|mainder of the night in her father's apartment: She ac|cordingly dre&s;&s;ed her, for Amanda's trembling hands refu&s;ed their accu&s;tomed office, and made her take a gla&s;s of wine and water ere &s;he &s;uffered her to move towards the door. Amanda was a&s;toni&s;hed, as &s;he ap|proached it, to hear a violent noi&s;e, like the mingled &s;ounds of laughing and &s;inging; her &s;oul recoiled at the tumult, and &s;he a&s;ked &s;i&s;ter Mary, with a countenance of terror, "what it meant?" She replied, "It was only &s;ome friends and neighbours doing honour to the Cap|tain." Amanda ha&s;tily opened the door anxious to ter|minate the &s;u&s;pence the&s;e words occa&s;ioned; but how great was her horror when &s;he perceived a &s;et of the meane&s;t ru&s;tics a&s;&s;embled round the bed, with every ap|pearance of inebriety, laughing, &s;houting and &s;moking: What a &s;avage &s;cene for a child, who&s;e heart was bur&s;t|ing with grief! She &s;hrieked with horror, and flinging her&s;elf into the arms of &s;i&s;ter Mary, conjured her to have the room cleared.</P>
<P>Si&s;ter Mary, from being accu&s;tomed to &s;uch &s;cenes, felt neither horror nor di&s;gu&s;t; &s;he complied, however, with the reque&s;t of Amanda, and be&s;ought them to de|part, &s;aying, "that Mi&s;s Fitzalan was a &s;tranger to their cu&s;toms, and be&s;ides, poor thing, quite be&s;ide her&s;elf with grief." They began to grumble at the pro|po&s;al of removing, they had made preparations for &s;pend|ing a merry night, and Mrs. Bryne &s;aid, "if &s;he had thought things would have turned out in this way, "The captain might have found &s;ome other place to die in&mdash;for the lea&s;t one could have, after his giving them &s;o much trouble, was a little enjoyment with one's friends at the latter end." Johnaten and Kate, who were among the party, joined their entreaties to &s;i&s;ter Mary's, and &s;he, to tempt them to compliance, &s;aid, "that in all probability they would &s;oon have another and a better opportunity for making merry than the pre&s;ent." They at length retired, and &s;i&s;ter Mary and Amanda were left alone in

the chamber of death. The dim light which remained ca&s;t a glimmering &s;hade upon the face of Fitzalan, that added to its gha&s;tlile&s;s; Amanda now indulged in all the luxury of grief, and found in &s;i&s;ter Mary a truly &s;ympathetic friend, for the good nun was famed through|out the little circle of her acquaintance for weeping with tho&s;e that wept, and rejoicing with tho&s;e that rejoiced. She obtained a promi&s;e from Amanda of accompanying her to St. Catherine's as &s;oon as her father was interred; and in return for this &s;he gave an a&s;&s;urance of continu|ing with her till the la&s;t melancholy offices were over, and al&s;o, that, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Johnaten, &s;he would &s;ee every thing proper provided; this was &s;ome comfort to Amanda, who felt her&s;elf at pre&s;ent une|qual to any exertion; yet, notwith&s;tanding her fatigue and illne&s;s, &s;he per&s;evered in her re&s;olution of &s;itting up with her father every night, dreading that, if &s;he retired to bed, a &s;cene of riot would again en&s;ue, which, in her opinion, was &s;acrilege to the dead. She went to bed every morning, and was nur&s;ed with the mo&s;t tender at|tention by &s;i&s;ter Mary, who al&s;o in&s;i&s;ted on being her companion at night. This, however, was but a mere matter of form, for the good &s;i&s;ter was totally unable to keep her eyes open, and &s;lept as comfortably upon the earthen floor, with her gown made into a pillow for her head, as if laid upon down; then was poor Amanda left to her own reflections, and the melancholy contem|plation of her beloved father's remains. The evening of the fourth day after his decea&s;e was fixed upon for his interment; with &s;treaming eyes and a breaking heart, Amanda beheld him put into the coffin, and in that moment felt as if he had again died before her. A &s;mall proce&s;&s;ion attended, con&s;i&s;ting of the people of the hou&s;e, Johnaten and K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">te, and a few re&s;pectable farmers, to whom Fitzalan had endeared him&s;elf during his &s;hort abode at Ca&s;tle Carberry; the men had &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ar&s;s and hat-hands, and the women hoods.</P>

Amanda by the mo&s;t painful efforts, &s;upported the preparations for his removal; but when &s;he &s;aw the coffin actually rai&s;ed to be taken out, &s;he could no longer re&s;train her feelings; &s;he &s;hrieked in the agony of her &s;oul, a &s;ickne&s;s, almo&s;t deadly &s;eized her, and &s;he fell fainting upon &s;i&s;ter Mary's bo&s;om!</P>

<P>SISTER MARY, recovered her with difficul|ty, but found it impo&s;&s;ible to remove her from the cabin till &s;he was more compo&s;ed. In about two hours its in|habitants returned, and the car having arrived, which &s;he had ordered to convey Amanda to St. Catherine's, &s;he was placed upon it in a &s;tate &s;carcely animate, and &s;up|ported by &s;i&s;ter Mary, was conveyed to that peaceful a&s;ylum.</P>
<P>On arriving at it, &s;he was carried immediately into the priore&s;s's apartment, who received and welcomed her with the mo&s;t tender affection and &s;en&s;ibility&mdash;a tender|ne&s;s which rou&s;ed Amanda from the &s;tupefaction into which &s;he appeared &s;inking, and made her weep violent|ly. She felt relieved from doing &s;o, and, as &s;ome re|turn for the kindne&s;s &s;he received, endeavoured to appear benefited by it; &s;he therefore declined going to bed, but lay down upon a little matted couch in the priore&s;s's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, the tea table was clo&s;e by it; as &s;he refu&s;ed any

other refre&s;hment, &s;he obtained this by a promi&s;e of eating &s;omething with it, none of the &s;i&s;terhood, &s;i&s;ter Mary excepted, were admitted, and Amanda felt this delicate attention and re&s;pect to her &s;orrows with gra|titude.</P>
<P>She arrived on the eve of their patron Saint at the convent, which was always celebrated with &s;olemnity: after tea, therefore, the priore&s;s and &s;i&s;ter Mary, were compel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to repair to the chapel, but &s;he removed the reluctance they felt to leave her alone by complaining of being drow&s;y. A pillow being laid under her head by &s;i&s;ter Mary, &s;oon after they quitted her &s;he fell into a profound &s;lumber, in which &s;he continued till awoke by di&s;tant mu&s;ic, &s;o &s;oft, &s;o clear, &s;o harmonious, that the delightful &s;en&s;ations it gave her &s;he could only com|pare to tho&s;e which &s;he imagined a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and pen&s;ive &s;oul would feel, when &s;pringing from the &s;hackles of mortality, it fir&s;t heard the heavenly &s;ounds that wel|comed it to the realms of eternal bli&s;s.</P>
<P>The chapel, from which tho&s;e cele&s;tial &s;ounds pro|ceeded, was at the extremity of the hou&s;e, &s;o that they &s;ometimes &s;welled upon her ear, &s;ometimes faintly &s;unk upon it. The pau&s;es in the organ, which was finely played, were filled up by the &s;weet, though le&s;s pow|ful &s;trains of the &s;i&s;terhood, who &s;ung an hymn in honour of their Saint.
<Q><L>No one was here exempt,</L>
<L>No voice but well could join melodious part.</L></Q></P>
<P>'Tis a foreta&s;te of heaven thought Amanda. She heard a deep &s;igh behind her. She turned her head ha&s;tily, and perceived a figure &s;tanding near, which bore a &s;trong re&s;emblance to Lord Mortimer. She was alarmed&mdash;She could not believe it was him. The light which the &s;mall heavy arched window admitted, was im|perfect, and &s;he ro&s;e from the couch to be better a&s;&s;ured it was or was not him; a &s;econd glance convinced her: &s;he might have believed her eyes at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Trembling and a&s;toni&s;hed &s;he &s;unk upon a &s;eat, ex|claiming,
<PB N="8" REF="038416_0408_1011E4AD884F8488">
"Gracious Heaven! what can have brought Lord Mortimer hither?"</P>
<P>He made no reply, but kneeling before her, took her hands in his and pre&s;&s;ed them to his forehead and lips, and laid his head upon them.</P>
<P>"Why," cried Amanda, unutterably affected by the emotions he betrayed, "why my Lord are you come hither!"</P>
<P>"To try," he replied, in a voice &s;carcely articulate, "whether Mi&s;s Fitzalan will yet con&s;ider me as her friend?"</P>
<P>"That my Lord," &s;aid &s;he, "depends upon circum|&s;tances; but while your Lord&s;hip remains in your pre|&s;ent po&s;ition, what they are I cannot explain."</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer in&s;tantly aro&s;e, and &s;eated him&s;elf by her; "Now tell me," &s;aid he, "what tho&s;e circum|&s;tances are."</P>
<P>"The fir&s;t, my Lord, is to exculpate my father in the opinion of Lord Cherbury, and by declaring the com|mencement and progre&s;s of our acquaintance, eradicate from his Lord&s;hip's mind the injurious &s;u&s;picions he en|tertained again&s;t him. This, perhaps, you will &s;ay is u&s;ele&s;s, con&s;idering tho&s;e &s;u&s;picions can no longer wound him; but my Lord, I deem it an incumbent duty on me to remove from his memory the obloquy on my account ca&s;t on it."</P>
<P>"I promi&s;e you mo&s;t &s;olemnly," &s;aid Lord Mortimer, "you &s;hall be obeyed. This is a debt of ju&s;tice, which I had re&s;olved to pay ere I received your injunction for doing &s;o; it is but lately I heard of the unju&s;t charges made again&s;t him; nor do I know what fiend gave ri&s;e to them."</P>
<P>"The &s;ame, perhaps," exclaimed Amanda, "who &s;pread &s;uch complicated &s;nares for my de&s;truction, and involved me in every horror but that which proceeds from con&s;cious guilt. Oh! my Lord, the &s;econd cir|cum&s;tance I allude to is, if you &s;hould hear my name treated with &s;corn and contempt by tho&s;e few, tho&s;e very few whom I had rea&s;on to e&s;teem, and to believe e&s;teemed me, that you will kindly interpo&s;e
<PB N="9" REF="038416_0409_1011E4B2A93F4F98">
in my ju&s;tification, and &s;ay, I merited not the a&s;per&s;ions ca&s;t upon me. Believe me innocent, and you will ea&s;i|ly per&s;uade others I am &s;o. You &s;hake your head, as much as to &s;ay you cannot think me &s;o after the proofs you have &s;een to the contrary. Ah! my Lord the proofs were contrived by malice and treachery, to ruin me in the e&s;timation of my friends, and by perfidy to force me into a crime, of which I already bear the ap|pearance and &s;tigma. Surely in this &s;olemn hour, which has &s;een my beloved father con&s;igned to his kindred earth, when, with a mind harra&s;&s;ed by &s;orrow, and a body worn out with fatigue, I feel as if &s;tanding on the verge of the grave, I &s;hould be the mo&s;t abandoned of wretches, if I could a&s;&s;ert my innocence without the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of really po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it: No, my Lord, by &s;uch a fal&s;hood I &s;hould not only be wicked, but fool|i&s;h in depriving my&s;elf of that happine&s;s hereafter, which will &s;o fully recompence my pre&s;ent mi&s;eries."</P>
<P>"Oh! Amanda," cried Lord Mortimer, who had been walking backwards and forward in an agitated manner while &s;he &s;poke, "you would almo&s;t convince me again&s;t the evidence of my own &s;en&s;es."</P>
<P>"Almo&s;t," &s;he repeated; then I &s;ee my Lord, you are determined to di&s;belive me, but why, &s;ince &s;o pre|judiced again&s;t me, have you come hither, was it merely to be a&s;&s;ured of my wretchedne&s;s? to hear me &s;ay that I &s;tand alone in the world, without one being intere&s;ted a|bout my welfare, that my pre&s;ent a&s;ylum is be&s;towed by charity, and that if my life be prolonged it mu&s;t be &s;pent in &s;truggling again&s;t con&s;titution, &s;orrow, and ill fame to procure a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence."</P>
<P>"No, no," exclaimed Lord Mortimer, flinging him|&s;elf at her feet, "never &s;hall you &s;uffer &s;uch mi&s;ery; were you even the being I was tempted to think you &s;ome time ago, never would Mortimer &s;uffer the woman his heart doated on to feel &s;uch calamity. I do not, I cannot believe you would deceive me. There is an irre|&s;i&s;tible eloquence in your words, that convinces me you have been the victim of treachery, and I its dupe: I cannot give you a more convincing proof of my confi|dence
<PB N="10" REF="038416_0410_1011E4B553690650">
in you, than by again renewing my entreaties to have one fame, one fate, one fortune ours."</P>
<P>The re&s;olution which Amanda had forced to &s;upport her through the painful &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ence &s;he gue&s;t would en&s;ue the moment &s;he &s;aw Lord Mortimer, now vani&s;hed and bur&s;t into a flood of tears.</P>
<P>She &s;aw his conduct in the mo&s;t generous, the mo&s;t exalted light, notwith&s;tanding appearances were &s;o much again&s;t her, he was willing to rely &s;olely on her own a&s;&s;everation of innocence, and to run every ri&s;k on her account; that by an union he might &s;helter her from the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of her pre&s;ent &s;ituation: But while her &s;en&s;ibility was affected by his expre&s;&s;ions, her pride was alarmed le&s;t he &s;hould impute her ardent de&s;ire of vin|dicating her&s;elf to the expectation of having his ad|dre&s;&s;es renewed. In broken accents &s;he endeavoured to remove &s;uch an idea if it had ari&s;en, and to convince him that all further intimacy between them mu&s;t now be terminated. Lord Mortimer a&s;cribed the latter part of her &s;peech to the re&s;entment &s;he felt again&s;t him for ever entertaining doubts of her worth. She de&s;ired him to ri&s;e, but he refu&s;ed till he was forgiven. My forgive|ne&s;s is your's indeed, my Lord, &s;aid &s;he, though your &s;u&s;picions wounded me to the &s;oul; I can &s;carcely won|der at your entertaining them, when I reflect on the dif|ferent &s;ituations in which I was found, which, if your Lord&s;hip can &s;pare a little longer time, or deem it worth devoting to &s;uch a purpo&s;e, as well as I am able I will account for being involved in.&mdash;Lord Mortimer declared his ardent de&s;ire to hear tho&s;e particulars, which nothing but a fear of fatiguing or agitating her could have pre|vented his before expre&s;&s;ing. He then &s;eated him&s;elf by her, and taking her cold and emaciated hand in his, li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ened to her little narrative.</P>
<P>She briefly informed him of her father's re&s;iding in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> after the death of her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, of the man|ner in which they became acquainted with Colonel Bel|grave, of his having ingratiated him&s;elf into their friend|&s;hip, by pretending to be O&s;car's friend, and then plun|ging
<PB N="11" REF="038416_0411_1011E4B6E3B42AD0">
them in di&s;tre&s;s, when he found they not only re|&s;i&s;ted but re&s;ented his villainous de&s;igns.</P>
<P>She related the artful manner in which Lady Grey|&s;tock, had drawn her from her father's protection, and the cold and in&s;olent reception &s;he met from the Marchi|one&s;s and her daughter, when introduced by the above|mentioned lady; the enmity the Marchione&s;s bore her father, the &s;udden alteration in her behaviour, the invi|tation to her hou&s;e, &s;o unexpected and unnece&s;&s;ary, all tending to in&s;pire a belief that &s;he was concerned in con|triving Colonel Belgrave's admittance to the hou&s;e, and had al&s;o given Lord Cherbury rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect the inte|grity of her father.</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer here interrupted Amanda to mention the conver&s;ation which pa&s;&s;ed between him and Mrs. Jane in the hall.</P>
<P>She rai&s;ed her hands and eyes to heaven with a&s;toni&s;h|ment at &s;uch wickedne&s;s, and &s;aid, "Though &s;he al|ways expected the girl's integrity, from a certain &s;yco|phant air, &s;he never imagined &s;he could be capable of &s;uch ba&s;ene&s;s.</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer again interrupted her, to mention what Lady Grey&s;tock had told him concerning Mrs. Jennings, as al&s;o what the hou&s;ekeeper had &s;aid of the note he gave for Amanda.</P>
<P>"Good God!" &s;aid Amanda, "when I hear of all the enemies I had, I almo&s;t wonder I e&s;caped &s;o well." She then re&s;umed her narrative, accounted for the di&s;like Mrs. Jennings had to her, and explained the way in which &s;he was entrapped into Colonel Belgrave's power, &s;he almo&s;t miraculous manner in which &s;he was freed from his hou&s;e, the friend&s;hip &s;he received from Howell, and the &s;ituation in which &s;he arrived at Ca&s;tle Carber|ry, and found her father. The clo&s;ing &s;cene &s;he could not de&s;cribe, for &s;ighs and &s;obs impeded her utterance. Lord Mortimer gently folded her to his brea&s;t; he called her his dear, his unfortunate, his lovely girl, more pre|cious than ever to his heart, and declared he never again would quit her till &s;he had given him a right to e&s;pou&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> quarrels, and &s;ecure her from the machinations of her
<PB N="12" REF="038416_0412_1011E4B8D780D498">
enemies. Her warm tears wet his cheek as &s;he exclaim|ed, "that could never be."</P>
<P>"My promi&s;e is already pa&s;t," cried &s;he; that which was given to the living &s;hall not be forfeited to the dead; and this, my Lord, by de&s;ign, is the la&s;t time we mu&s;t ever meet."</P>
<P>"What promi&s;e! "exclaimed Lord Mortimer, "&s;urely no one could be &s;o inhuman as to extort a promi&s;e from you to give me up."</P>
<P>"It was not inhumanity extorted it," replied Aman|da; "but honour, rectitude, and di&s;cretion, without for|feiting tho&s;e, never can I violate it. There is but one event could make me acquie&s;ce in your wi&s;hes, that is, having a fortune adequate to yours to bring you, becau&s;e then Lord Cherbury would a&s;cribe no &s;elfi&s;h motive to my conduct; but as &s;uch an event is utterly improbable, I might almo&s;t &s;ay impo&s;&s;ible, it is certain we never &s;hall be united. Any farther intercou&s;e between us, you mu&s;t therefore be convinced would injure me. Di&s;turb not, therefore, my Lord, my retirement; but ere you depart, allow me to a&s;&s;ure you, you have lightened the weight on my heart by crediting what I have &s;aid; &s;hould I not recover from the illne&s;s which now preys upon me, it will cheer my departing &s;pirit to know you think me innocent; and, if I live, it will &s;upport me through many difficulties, and often, perhaps, after the toils of a bu&s;y day, &s;hall comfort my&s;elf by reflecting, that tho&s;e I e&s;teem, if they think of me, it is with their wonted regard."</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer was affected by the manner in which &s;he &s;poke, his eyes began to gli&s;ten, and he was again declaring he would not &s;uffer her to &s;acrifice happine&s;s at the &s;hrine of a too &s;crupulous and romantic genero&s;i|ty, when the door opened and the priore&s;s and &s;i&s;ter Mary (who had been detained in the chapel by a long di&s;cour&s;e from the Prie&s;t) entered, bearing lights.</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer &s;tarted in much confu&s;ion, retreated to one of the windows, and drew out his handkerchief to conceal the emotions Amanda had excited. She was unable to &s;peak to the priore&s;s and &s;i&s;ter Mary, who
<PB N="13" REF="038416_0413_1011D03C65EA0248">
&s;tared round them, and then at each other, not certain whether they &s;hould advance or retreat. Lord Morti|mer in a few moments recovered his compo&s;ure, and advancing to the priore&s;s apologized for his intru&s;ion into her apartment; but &s;aid he had the honour of being a friend of Mi&s;s Fitzalan's, and could not re&s;i&s;t his wi&s;h to enquiring in per&s;on after her health as &s;oon as he arrived in the country.</P>
<P>The priore&s;s, who had once &s;een a good deal of the polite world, received this addre&s;s with ea&s;e and com|plai&s;ance. Si&s;ter Mary went over to Amanda, and found her weak, trembling, and weeping. She expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t concern at &s;eeing her in &s;uch a &s;ituation, and im|mediately procured her a gla&s;s of wine, which &s;he in&s;i&s;t|ed on her taking. The lights now gave Lord Mortimer an opportunity of contemplating the depredations which grief and &s;ickne&s;s had made upon her. Her pale and &s;allow complexion, her heavy and &s;unken eyes, &s;truck him with horror. He could not conceal his feelings.&mdash;"Gracious heaven," cried he, going to the couch, and taking her hand, "I fear you are very ill."</P>
<P>She looked mournfully in his face without &s;peaking; but this look was &s;ufficient to a&s;&s;ure him he was not mi&s;taken. The efforts &s;he had made to conver&s;e with him, and the yet greater efforts &s;he had made to ba|ni&s;h him for ever from her, quite exhau&s;ted her: after the various mi&s;eries &s;he had gone through, how &s;ooth|ing to her &s;oul would have been the attentions of Lord Mortimer, how plea&s;ing, how delightful, the a&s;ylum &s;he &s;hould have found in his arms! But no temptation, no di&s;tre&s;s, &s;he re&s;olved &s;hould ever make her di&s;obey the injunction of her adored father.</P>
<P>"She is very bad, indeed." Said &s;i&s;ter Mary, "and we mu&s;t get her to bed as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible."</P>
<P>"She requires re&s;t and repo&s;e indeed," &s;aid Lord Mortimer; "but tell me, my dear Mi&s;s Fitzalan," taking her hand, "if I have tho&s;e good ladies per|mi&s;&s;ion for calling here to-morrow, will you, if able to ri&s;e, &s;ee me?"</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="038416_0414_1011E4C103EAD690">
"I cannot indeed," &s;aid Amanda "I have already declared this mu&s;t be our la&s;t interview, and I &s;hall not retract from what I have &s;aid."</P>
<P>"Then," exclaimed Lord Mortimer, regardle&s;s, or rather forgetful of tho&s;e who heard him, from the agitation and warmth of his feelings, "I &s;hall, in one re&s;pect at lea&s;t, accu&s;e you of di&s;&s;imulation, that of feigning a regard for me you never felt."</P>
<P>"Such an accu&s;ation is now of little con&s;equence," replied Amanda; "perhaps you had better think it ju&s;t."</P>
<P>"Cruel inexorable girl, to refu&s;e &s;eeing me, to wi&s;h to have the anxiety which now preys upon my heart prolonged."</P>
<P>"Young man," &s;aid the priore&s;s, in an accent of di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;eeing the tears &s;treaming down Amanda's cheeks, "re&s;pect her &s;orrows."</P>
<P>"Re&s;pect them, madam," repeated he, "Oh! heaven, I re&s;pect, I venerate them; but will you, my dear lady, when Mi&s;s Fitzalan is able, prevail on her to communicate the particulars of our acquaint|ance; and will you then become my advocate, and per&s;uade her to receive my vi&s;its?"</P>
<P>"Impo&s;&s;ible Sir," &s;aid the priore&s;s, "I &s;hall never attempt to de&s;ire a larger &s;hare of confidence from Mi&s;s Fitzalan than &s;he de&s;ires to be&s;tow upon me. From my knowledge of her I am convinced her con|duct will always be guided by di&s;cretion; &s;he has greatly obliged me by chu&s;ing this humble retreat for her re&s;idence; &s;he has put her&s;elf under my protection, and I &s;hall endeavour to fulfil that &s;acred tru&s;t by &s;e|curing her from any mole&s;tation."</P>
<P>"Well, madam," &s;aid Lord Mortimer, "I flatter my&s;elf Mi&s;s Fitzalan will do me ju&s;tice in declaring my vi&s;its proceeded from wi&s;hes which though &s;he may di&s;appoint, &s;he cannot di&s;approve. I &s;hall no longer intrude upon your time or her's, but will &s;till hope I &s;hall find you both le&s;s inflexible."</P>
<P>He took up his hat, he approached the door; but when he glanced at Amanda, he could not depart without
<PB N="15" REF="038416_0415_1011E4C2A73FCE48">
&s;peaking to her, and again went to the couch. He en|treated her to compo&s;e and exert her&s;elf; he de&s;ired her forgivene&s;s for any warmth he had betrayed, and he whi&s;pered to her that all his earthly happine&s;s de|pended on her re&s;toration to health, and her becoming his. He in&s;i&s;ted on her now giving him her hand as a pledge of amity between them. She complied; but when pre&s;uming on this he again a&s;ked her con&s;ent to repeat his vi&s;its, he found her inexorable as ever, and retired, if not with a di&s;plea&s;ed, a di&s;appointed coun|tenance. Si&s;ter Mary attended him from the apart|ment.&mdash;At the door of the convent he reque&s;ted her to walk a few paces from it with him, &s;aying he wanted to &s;peak to her. She con&s;ented, and remembering he was the per&s;on who frightened her one evening among&s;t the ruins, determined now, if &s;he had an opportunity, to a&s;k what had then brought him hither."</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer knew the poverty of the convent and feared Amanda might want many things, or its inha|bitants be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed to procure them for her; he there|fore pulled out a pur&s;e, and pre&s;enting it to &s;i&s;ter Mary, reque&s;ted &s;he would apply it for Mi&s;s Fitzalan's u&s;e, without mentioning any thing about it to her."</P>
<P>Si&s;ter Mary &s;hook the pur&s;e&punc; "Oh! Je&s;u Maria," exclaimed &s;he, "how heavy it is!"</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer was retiring, when catching hold of him, &s;he cried, "&s;tay, &s;tay, I have a word or two to &s;ay to you: I wonder how much there is in this pur&s;e?"</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer &s;miled.&mdash;"If not enough for the pre|&s;ent emergencies," &s;aid he, "it &s;hall &s;oon be repleni&s;hed."</P>
<P>Si&s;ter Mary &s;at down upon a tomb &s;tone, and very deliberately counted the money into her lap, "Oh! mercy," &s;aid &s;he, "I never &s;aw &s;o many guineas to|gether before in all my life!"</P>
<P>Again Lord Mortimer &s;miled, and was retiring, but again &s;topping him, &s;he returned the gold into the pur&s;e, and declared, "&s;he neither would or dur&s;t keep it."</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer was provoked at this declaration, and without replying to it walked on. She ran nimbly after
<PB N="16" REF="038416_0416_1011E4C5F9D5C170">
him, and dropping the pur&s;e at his feet, was out of &s;ight in a moment.</P>
<P>When &s;he returned to the priore&s;s's apartment &s;he related the incident, and took much merit to her&s;elf for acting &s;o prudently, the priore&s;s commended her very much, and poor Amanda, with a faint voice, &s;aid &s;he had acted quite <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight.</P>
<P>A little room, in&s;ide the priore&s;s's chamber, was prepared for Amanda, into which &s;he was now con|veyed, and the good natured &s;i&s;ter Mary brought her own bed, and laid it be&s;ide her's.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT will now be nece&s;&s;ary to account for the &s;udden appearance of Lord Mortimer at the convent. Our reader may recollect, that we left him in London, in the deepe&s;t affliction for the &s;uppo&s;ed perfidy of A|manda&mdash;an affliction which knew no diminution from time, neither the tenderne&s;s of his aunt, Lady Martha Dormer, or the kind con&s;ideration his father &s;hewed for him, who for the pre&s;ent cea&s;ed to importune him about Lady Euphra&s;ia, could have any lenient effect upon him; he pined in thought, and felt a di&s;ta&s;te to all &s;ociety; he at la&s;t began to think, that though Amanda had been unhappily led a&s;tray, &s;he might ere this have re|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ted of her error, and for&s;aken Colonel Belgrave; to know whether &s;he had done &s;o, or whether &s;he could be prevailed upon to give him up, he believed would be an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of his &s;orrows. No &s;ooner had he per&s;uaded him&s;elf of this, than he determined on going to Ireland
<PB N="17" REF="038416_0417_1011E4CA70A93AC8">
without delay, to vi&s;it Captain Fitzalan, and if &s;he was not returned to his protection, advi&s;e with him about &s;ome method of re&s;toring her to it.</P>
<P>He told Lord Cherbury he thought an excur&s;ion into Wales would be of &s;ervice to him. His Lord&s;hip agreed in thinking it might, and &s;ecretly delighted that all danger relative to Amanda was over, gladly concurred in whatever could plea&s;e his &s;on, flattering him&s;elf, that on his return to London, he would no longer rai&s;e any objections to an alliance with the fair Scotch heire&s;s.</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer travelled with as much expedition to Holyhead, as if certain that perfect happine&s;s, not a &s;mall alleviation of mi&s;ery, would be the recompence of his journey. He concealed from his aunt the real motives which actuated him to it, blu&s;hing, even, to him&s;elf, at the weakne&s;s which he &s;till felt relative to Amanda.</P>
<P>When he cro&s;&s;ed the water he again &s;et off po&s;t, at|tended on hor&s;eback only by his own man; within one mile of Ca&s;tle Carberry he met the little mournful pro|ce&s;&s;ion approaching, which was attending poor Fitzalan to his la&s;t home. The carriage &s;topped to let them pa&s;s, and in the la&s;t of the group he perceived Johnaten, who at the &s;ame moment recognized him. Johnaten, with much &s;urpri&s;e in his countenance, &s;tepped up to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> carriage, and after bowing, and humbly hoping his lord&s;hip was well, with a melancholy &s;hake of his head, informed him who&s;e remains he was following.</P>
<P>"Captain Fitzalan dead!" repeated Lord Morti|mer, with a face as pale as death, and a faultering voice, while his heart &s;unk within him at the idea that his father was in &s;ome degree acce&s;&s;ary to the fatal e|vent; for ju&s;t before he left London Lord Cherbury had informed him of the letter he wrote to Fitzalan, and this he believed, joined to his own immediate family misfortunes, had precipitated him from the world.&mdash;"Captain Fitzalan dead!" he exclaimed.</P>
<P>"Yes, an plea&s;e you my Lord," &s;aid Johnaten, wiping away a tear, "and he has not left a better o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a
<PB N="18" REF="038416_0418_1011E4CD40835CE8">
braver man behind him. Poor gentleman, the world pre&s;&s;ed hard upon him"</P>
<P>"Had he no tender friend about him?" a&s;ked Lord Mortimer. "Were neither of his children with him?"</P>
<P>"Oh! yes, my Lord, poor Mi&s;s Amanda."</P>
<P>"She was with him," &s;aid Lord Mortimer, in an eager accent.</P>
<P>"Yes, my Lord, &s;he returned here about ten days ago, but &s;o &s;adly altered, I think &s;he won't &s;tay long behind him: Poor thing, &s;he is going fa&s;t indeed, and the more's the pity, for &s;he is a &s;weet creature."</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer was inexpre&s;&s;ibly &s;hocked; he wi&s;hed to hide his emotions, and waved his hand to Johnaten to depart; but Johnaten either did not, or would not, under&s;tand the motion, and he was obliged, in broken accents, to &s;ay, he would no longer detain him."</P>
<P>The return of Amanda was to him a convicton that &s;he had &s;een her error in its true light; he pictured to him&s;elf the affecting &s;cene which mu&s;t have en&s;ued between a dying father and a penitent daughter, &s;o loved, &s;o valued as was Amanda.&mdash;Her &s;ituation, when &s;he re|ceived his forgivene&s;s and benediction, he repre&s;ented her to him&s;elf as at once bewailing the lo&s;s of her father, and her offences, endeavouring, by prayers, by tears, by &s;ighs, to obliterate them in the &s;ight of heaven, and render her&s;elf &s;it to receive its awful fiat.</P>
<P>He heard &s;he was dying; his &s;oul recoiled at the idea of &s;eeing her &s;hrouded in her native clay, and yet he could not help believing this the only peaceful a&s;ylum &s;he could find, to be freed from the &s;hafts of contempt and malice of the world. He trembled le&s;t he &s;hould not behold the lovely penitent while &s;he was capable of ob|&s;erving him; to receive a la&s;t adieu, though dreadful, would yet, he thought, lighten the horrors of an eternal &s;eparation, and perhaps too, it would be &s;ome comfort to her departing &s;pirit to know from him he had pardoned her, and con&s;cious &s;urely, he thought to him&s;elf, &s;he mu&s;t be of needing pardon from him, whom &s;he had &s;o long impo&s;ed on by a &s;pecious pretext of virtue. He had heard from Lord Cherbury, that Captain Fitzalan had
<PB N="19" REF="038416_0419_1011E4CED301FB68">
quitted the Ca&s;tle; he knew not therefore at pre&s;ent where to find Amanda, nor did he chu&s;e to make any enquiries till he again &s;aw Johnaten.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the proce&s;&s;ion was out of &s;ight he alighted from the carriage, and ordering his man to di&s;charge it, on arriving at Ca&s;tle Carberry, he took a path acro&s;s the fields, which brought him to the &s;ide of the church-yard where Fitzalan was to be interred.</P>
<P>He reached it ju&s;t as the coffin was lowering into the earth, a yew tree growing by the wall again&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he leaned, hid him from ob&s;ervation. He heard ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y of the ru&s;tics mentioning the merits of the decea&s;ed, in terms of warm, though artle&s;s, commendation, and he &s;aw Johnaten receiving the hat and &s;word, which, as military trophies, he had lain upon the coffin, with a flood of tears.</P>
<P>When the church-yard was cleared, he &s;tepped acro&s;s the broken wall to the &s;ilent man&s;ion of Fitzalan; the &s;cene was wild and dreary, and a lowering evening &s;eemed in uni&s;on with the &s;ad objects around. Lord Mortimer was &s;unk in the deepe&s;t de&s;pondence; he felt awfully convinced of the in&s;tability of human attain|ments, and the vanity of human pur&s;uits, not only from the ceremony he had ju&s;t witne&s;&s;ed, but his own &s;itua|tion; the fond hopes of his heart, the gay expectations of his youth, and the hilarity of his &s;oul were bla&s;ted&mdash;never, he feared, to revive. Virtue, rank and fortune, advantages &s;o highly prized by mankind, were unable to give him comfort, to remove the malady of his heart, to admini&s;ter one oblivious antidote to a mind di&s;ea&s;ed.</P>
<P>"Peace to thy &s;hade, thou unfortunate &s;oldier," ex|claimed he, after &s;tanding &s;ome time by the grave with folded arms: "Peace to thy &s;hade&mdash;peace which &s;hall reward thee for a life of toil and trouble; happy &s;hould I have deemed my&s;elf, had it been my lot to have light|ened thy grief, or cheared thy clo&s;ing hours; but tho&s;e who were dearer to thee than exi&s;tence I may yet &s;erve, and thus make the only attonement now in my power for the inju&s;tice I fear was done thee; thy Amanda, and thy
<PB N="20" REF="038416_0420_1011E4D066ECF358">
gallant &s;on, &s;hall be my care, and his path, I tru&s;t, it will be in my power, to &s;mooth through life."</P>
<P>A tear fell from Lord Mortimer upon the grave, and he turned mournfully from it towards Ca&s;tle Carberry. Here Johnaten was arrived before him, and had already a large fire lighted in the dre&s;&s;ing room poor Amanda, on coming to the Ca&s;tle, had cho&s;en for her&s;elf. John|aten fixed on this for Lord Mortimer, as the parlours had been &s;hut up ever &s;ince Capt. Fitzalan's departure, and could not be put in order till the next day; but it was the wor&s;t place Lord Mortimer could have entered, as not only it&s;elf but every thing in it reminded him of Amanda, and the grief it excited at his fir&s;t entrance was &s;o violent as to alarm not only his man (who was &s;preading a table with refre&s;hments) but Johnaten, who was a&s;&s;i&s;ting him. He &s;oon checked it, however; but when he again looked round the room and beheld it orna|mented by works done by Amanda, he could &s;carcely prevent another bur&s;t of grief as violent as the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>He now learned Amanda's re&s;idence, and &s;o great was his impatience to &s;ee her, that, apprehen&s;ive the convent would &s;oon be clo&s;ed, he &s;et off, fatigued as he was, without taking any refre&s;hment.</P>
<P>He intended to a&s;k for one of the ladies of St. Cathe|rines, and intreat her, if Amanda was then in a &s;ituation to be &s;een, to announce his arrival to her; but after rap|ping repeatedly with a rattan again&s;t the door, the only per&s;on who appeared to him was a &s;ervant girl. From her he learned that the ladies were all in the chapel, and that Mi&s;s Fitzalan was in the priore&s;s's apartment. He a&s;ked, "Was &s;he too ill to be &s;een!" The girl re|plied, "No;" for having only entered the room to leave the kettle in it, at a time when Amanda was com|po&s;ed, &s;he imagined &s;he was very well.</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer then told her his name, and de&s;ired her to go up to Mi&s;s Fitzalan and inquire whether &s;he would &s;ee him. The girl attempted not to move; &s;he was in reality &s;o &s;truck of a heap, by hearing that &s;he had been talking to a Lord, that &s;he know not whether &s;he was &s;tanding on her head or her heels. Lord Morti|mer
<PB N="21" REF="038416_0421_1011E4D32FBCD340">
imputing her &s;ilence to di&s;inclination to comply with his reque&s;t, put a guinea, into her hand, and entreat|ed her to be expeditious. This re&s;tored her to anima|tion; but ere &s;he reached the room &s;he forgot his title, and being a&s;hamed to deliver a blundering me&s;&s;age to Mi&s;s Fitzalan, or to appear &s;tupid to Lord Mortimer, &s;he returned to him, pretending that &s;he had delivered his me&s;&s;age, and that he might go up. She &s;hewed him the door, and when he entered he imputed the &s;ilence of Amanda, and her not moving, to the effects of her grief, he advanced to the couch, and was not a little &s;hocked on &s;eeing her eyes clo&s;ed; concluding from this that &s;he had fainted, but her ea&s;y re&s;piration &s;oon convinced him that this was a mi&s;take, and he immediately concluded that the girl had deceived him. He leaned over her till &s;he began to &s;tir, and then retreated behind her, lea&s;t his pre&s;ence, on her fir&s;t awaking, &s;hould alarm her.</P>
<P>What took place in the interview between them has already been related, notwith&s;tanding appearances were &s;o much again&s;t her, and no explanation had en&s;ued re|lative to them; from the moment &s;he a&s;&s;erted her inno|cence with &s;olemnity, he could no longer doubt it, and yielding at once to his conviction, to his love, to his pi|ty for her, he again renewed his overtures for an union. Hearing of the &s;tratagems laid for her de&s;truction, the dangers &s;he had e&s;caped, the di&s;tre&s;&s;es &s;he had experi|enced, made him more anxious than ever for completing it; that by his con&s;tant protection he might &s;ecure her from &s;imilar trials, and by his tenderne&s;s and care re&s;tore her to health, peace and happine&s;s. He longed for the period of her triumphing over the perfidious Marchion|e&s;s, and the dete&s;table Lady Euphra&s;ia, by being rai&s;ed to that &s;tation they had &s;o long attempted to prevent her attaining, and thus proving to them that virtue, &s;ooner or later, will counteract the de&s;igns of vice.&mdash;He felt a degree of rapture at the idea of his being no longer obliged to regret the ardent, the unabated affec|tion he felt for her.</P>
<P>His tran&s;ports were &s;omewhat checked when &s;he &s;o|lemnly declared an union between them impo&s;&s;ible, and
<PB N="22" REF="038416_0422_1011E4D747DBDB28">
forbade his &s;eeing her again. He was piqued by the &s;teadine&s;s with which &s;he repeated this re&s;olution, but her pre&s;ent weak &s;tate prevented his betraying any re|&s;entment, and he flattered him&s;elf he would be able to conquer her ob&s;tinacy; he could not now indeed de&s;pair of any event after the unexpected re&s;toration of Aman|da to his e&s;teem, and the revival of tho&s;e hopes of feli|city, which in the certainty of having lo&s;t her had faded away.</P>
<P>He returned, as Johnaten &s;aid, an altered man to the Ca&s;tle; he no longer experienced horror at entering the dre&s;&s;ing room, which di&s;played &s;o many ve&s;tiges of his Amanda's ta&s;te.</P>
<P>He re&s;olved on an immediate union as the &s;ure&s;t proof he could give her of his perfect confidence in her &s;incerity, not allowing him&s;elf to &s;uppo&s;e &s;he would continue firm in the re&s;olution &s;he had recently avowed to him. He then intended &s;etting off for London, and &s;paring neither time, trouble, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> expence, to obtain from the inferior agents in the plot laid again&s;t her, a full avowal of the part they had them&s;elves acted in it, and all they knew relative to tho&s;e performed by others. This was not de&s;igned for his own &s;atisfaction, he wan|ted no confirmation of what Amanda had a&s;&s;erted, as his meaning to marry her immediately demon&s;trated, it was to cover with confu&s;ion tho&s;e who had meditated her de&s;truction, and add to the horrors they would ex|perience when they found her emerging from ob&s;curity, not as Mi&s;s Fitzalan, but Lady Mortimer. Such proofs of her innocence would al&s;o prevent malice from &s;aying he was a dupe of art, and he was convinced, for both their &s;akes, it was requi&s;ite to procure them; he would then avow his marriage, return for his wife, introduce her to his friends, and, if his father kept up any re&s;ent|ment again&s;t them longer than he expected, he knew, in Lady Martha Dormer's hou&s;e, and at Tudor Hall, he would find not only an eligible but plea&s;ant re&s;idence. Tho&s;e delightful &s;chemes kept him awake half the night, and when he fell a&s;leep it was only to dream of happine&s;s and Amanda.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="038416_0423_1011E4DA38E62980">
In the morning, notwith&s;tanding the prohibition he had received to the contrary, he went to enquire how &s;he was, and to try and &s;ee her. The girl who had an|&s;wered his repeated knocks the preceding evening, ap|peared, and told him Mi&s;s Fitzalan was very bad. He began to think that this mu&s;t be a pretext to avoid &s;ee|ing him, and to come at the truth, was &s;lipping a bribe into her hand, when &s;i&s;ter Mary, who had been watch|ing them from an adjoining room, appeared and &s;topped this mea&s;ure. She repeated what the girl had ju&s;t &s;aid, and in addition to it, declared that, even if Mi&s;s Fitz|alan was up, &s;he would not &s;ee him, and that he mu&s;t come no more to St. Catherine's, as both Mi&s;s Fitzalan and the priore&s;s would re&s;ent &s;uch conduct exceedingly, and that if he wanted to enquire after the health of the former, he might ea&s;ily &s;end a &s;ervant, and it would be much better done than to come fri&s;king over there every moment.</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer was &s;eriou&s;ly di&s;plea&s;ed with this un|ceremonius &s;peech, "So, I &s;uppo&s;e," cried he, "you want to make a real nun of Mi&s;s Fitzalan, and to keep her from all conver&s;ation."</P>
<P>"And a happy creature &s;he would be were &s;he to be|come one of us," replied &s;i&s;ter Mary, "and as too keep|ing her from conver&s;ation, &s;he might have as much as &s;he plea&s;ed with any one. Indeed I believe the poor thing likes you well enough, the more's her misfortune for doing &s;o."</P>
<P>"I thank you, madam," cried Lord Mortimer; "I &s;uppo&s;e it one of your vows to &s;peak truth, if &s;o, I mu&s;t acknowledge you keep it religiou&s;ly."</P>
<P>"I have ju&s;t heard her," proceeded &s;i&s;ter Mary, with|out minding what he &s;aid, "tell the priore&s;s a long &s;to|ry about you and her&s;elf, by which I find it was her fa|ther's de&s;ire &s;he &s;hould have nothing more to &s;ay to you, and I dare &s;ay the poor gentleman had good rea&s;ons for doing &s;o. I beg, my Lord, you will come no more here, and, indeed, I think it was a &s;hame for you to give money to the &s;impleton who an&s;wered you. Why, it was enough

He was half di&s;tracted with doubt and anxiety, which were &s;carcely &s;upportable, when he reflected that they could not for &s;ometime be &s;atisfied, &s;ince, even if he wrote to her for that purpo&s;e, &s;he could not at pre&s;ent be able to an&s;wer his letter; again he felt convinced of the in&s;tability of earthly happine&s;s, and the clo&s;e connex|ion there has ever been between plea&s;ure and pain.</P>

<P>THE fatigue, di&s;tre&s;s and agitation of Amanda could no longer be &s;truggled with; &s;he &s;unk beneath their violence, and for a week was confined to her bed by the fever which &s;eized her in England, and had ever &s;ince lurked in her veins. The whole &s;i&s;terhood, who took it in turn to attend her, vied with each other in kindne&s;s and care to the poor invalid.

<P>This letter greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Amanda. She had hop|ed the pain of again rejecting his vi&s;its and reque&s;ts would have been &s;pared her. She gue&s;&s;ed at the ex|pre&s;&s;ions he alluded to in his letter, they were tho&s;e &s;he had dropped relative to the promi&s;e to her father, and from the impetuous and tender feelings of Lord Mor|timer, &s;he ea&s;ily conceived the agony he would experi|ence when he found this promi&s;e inviolable; &s;he felt more for his di&s;tre&s;s than her own; her heart, &s;ea&s;oned in the &s;chool of adver&s;ity, could bear its &s;orrows with calm|ne&s;s; but this was not the ca&s;e, and &s;he paid the tribute of tears to a love &s;o fervent, &s;o faithful, and &s;o hopele&s;s.</P>
<P>She then reque&s;ted &s;i&s;ter Mary to acquaint his me&s;&s;en|ger that &s;he received no vi&s;its; that, as &s;he was tolerably recovered, &s;he intreated his Lord&s;hip would not take the trouble of continuing his inquiries about her health, or to &s;end her any more written me&s;&s;ages, as &s;he wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> unable to an&s;wer them. The priore&s;s, who was pre&s;ent when &s;he received the letter, commended her exceedingly for the fortitude and di&s;cretion &s;he had manife&s;ted. Amanda had deemed it nece&s;&s;ary to inform her, after the conver|&s;ation &s;he heard between her and Lord Mortimer, of the terms on which they &s;tood with each other, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">, who doubted whether his Lord&s;hip was in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

as honourable as he profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, thought Amanda on the &s;ure &s;ide in declining his vi&s;its.</P>
<P>The next morning the Doctor called as u&s;ual. He told Amanda he had brought her an entertaining book, for no &s;uch thing could be procured at St. Catherine's, and as &s;he had expre&s;&s;ed her regret at this, from the time &s;he had been able to read, he had &s;upplied her from his library, which was exten&s;ive and well cho&s;en.</P>
<P>He did not pre&s;ent it to her till he was retiring, and then &s;aid, with a &s;ignificant &s;mile, &s;he would find it con|tained &s;omething worthy of her particular attention.&mdash;Amanda was alone and immediately opened it. Great was her a&s;toni&s;hment when a letter dropped from it into her lap! She &s;natched it up and perceiving the directions in Lord Mortimer's hand, &s;he he&s;itated whether &s;he &s;hould open a letter conveyed in this manner; but to return it unopened was &s;urely a &s;light Lord Mortimer merited not, and &s;he broke the &s;eal with a trembling hand and a pal|pitating heart.</P>

<P>To compel me to u&s;e &s;tratagems in writing to you, and de&s;troy the delightful hopes which had &s;prung in my &s;oul at the pro&s;pect of being about to receive a reward for my &s;ufferings. Am I ever to be involved in doubts and perplexity on your account? Am I ever to &s;ee diffi|culty &s;uceeded by difficulty, and hope by di&s;appoint|ment?</P>
<P>You mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of the anxiety I &s;hall feel until your ambiguous expre&s;&s;ions are fully explained, and yet you refu&s;e this explanation! But you have no pity for my feelings.

To know the wor&s;t is &s;ome degree of ea&s;e; be&s;ides I &s;hould then have an opportunity of perhaps convincing you that virtue, unlike vice, has its bounds, and that we may &s;ometimes carry our notions of honour and genero&s;ity too far, and &s;acrifice our real happine&s;s to chimerical ideas of them. Surely I &s;hall not be too pre&s;umptuous in &s;ay|ing, that, if the regard Amanda once flattered me with is

<P>Oh! do not, my dear and too &s;crupulous girl, think a moment longer of per&s;evering in a re&s;olution &s;o prejudi|cial to your welfare. Your &s;ituation requires particular protection; young, innocent, and beautiful, already the object of licentious pur&s;uits, your neare&s;t relations your greate&s;t enemies, your brother, from his un&s;ettled line of life, unable to be near you. Oh! my Amanda, from &s;uch a &s;ituation what evils may accrue? Avoid them, by taking refuge in his arms, who will be to you a ten|der friend, and faithful guardian, before &s;uch evils, the obligations for keeping a promi&s;e to reject me fade away, particularly when the motives which led to &s;uch a pro|mi&s;e are con&s;idered. Captain Fitzalan, hurt by the un|fortunate letter he received from my father, extended his re&s;entment to his &s;on, and called upon you, without re|flecting on the con&s;equences of &s;uch a mea&s;ure, to give me up. This is the only rea&s;on I can conceive for his de&s;iring &s;uch a promi&s;e, and had I but arrived while he could have li&s;tened to my arguments, I am firmly con|vinced, in&s;tead of appo&s;ing, he would have &s;anctioned our union, and given his beloved girl to a man who, in every in&s;tance, would &s;tudy to evince his gratitude for &s;uch a gift, and to &s;upply his lo&s;s.</P>
<P>Happine&s;s, my dear Amanda, is in long arrears with us. She is now ready to make up for pa&s;t deficiencies, if it is not our own faults; let us not frighten her from performing her good intentions, but hand in hand re|ceive the lovely and long ab&s;ent gue&s;t to our bo&s;oms.</P>
<P>You will not, cannot, mu&s;t not, be inflexible; I &s;hall expect, as &s;oon as you read this, a &s;ummons to St. Catherine's, to receive the ratification of my hopes; in every thing re&s;pecting our union I will be guided by you except delaying it; what we have both &s;uffered already from deceit makes me doubly anxious to &s;ecure you mine, le&s;t another vile &s;cheme &s;hould be formed to effect our &s;eparation.</P>
<P>Oh! Amanda, the fainte&s;t pro&s;pects of calling you mine gives to my heart a felicity no language can expre&s;s.

Refu&s;e not being mine, except you bring me an addition of fortune; already rich in every virtue, I &s;hall, in ob|taining you obtain a trea&s;ure, which the wealthie&s;t, the proude&s;t, and the vaine&s;t of the &s;ons of men may envy me the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, and which the good, the &s;en&s;ible, and the elegant, mu&s;t e&s;teem the kinde&s;t gift indulgent heaven could be&s;tow on me.

<P>This letter deeply affected the &s;en&s;ibility, but could not &s;hake the re&s;olution of Amanda. She would not have an&s;wered it, as &s;he con&s;idered any corre&s;pondence an infringement on the promi&s;es &s;he had given her fa|ther to decline any further intimacy with him; but from the warmth and agitation di&s;played in his letter, it was evident to her, that if he did not receive an immediate an&s;wer to it, he would come to St. Catherine's and in&s;i&s;t on &s;eeing her; and &s;he felt a&s;&s;ured, that &s;he would much better deliver her &s;entiments upon paper than to him; &s;he accordingly wrote as follows:</P>

vain, my Lord, would you, by &s;ophi&s;try cloaked with tenderne&s;s for that purpo&s;e, try to influence me. The arguments you have made u&s;e of, I am convinced, you never would have adopted, had you not been mi&s;taken in regard to tho&s;e motives which prompted my father to a&s;k a promi&s;e from me of declining any farther connexi|on with you: it was not from re&s;entment, my Lord, no his death was then fa&s;t approaching, and he in charity for all mankind, forgave tho&s;e who had wounded him by unju&s;t reproach and accu&s;ation; it was a proper re|&s;pect for his own character, and not re&s;entment which influenced his conduct, as he was convinced, if I con|&s;ented to an alliance with you, Lord Cherbury would be confirmed in all the &s;u&s;picions he entertained of his hav|ing entangled you with me, and con&s;equently load his memory with contempt; tenderne&s;s al&s;o for me actuated him; he was acquainted with the proud heart of Lord Cherbury, and knew that if, poor and reduced as I was, I entered his family, I &s;hould be con&s;idered and treated as a mean intruder. So thoroughly am I convinced that he did not err in this idea, that, whenever rea&s;on is pre|dominant in my mind, I think, even if a promi&s;e did not exi&s;t for &s;uch a purpo&s;e, I &s;hould decline your ad|dre&s;&s;es; for, though I could &s;ubmit with cheerfulne&s;s to many inconveniencies for your &s;ake, I never could &s;up|port indignities.

<P>Let not your Lord&s;hip deem me either unkind or un|grateful; my heart di&s;avows the ju&s;tice of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> accu|&s;ations, and is but too &s;en&s;ible of your tenderne&s;s and genero&s;ity.

<P>Never, my Lord, &s;hould I enjoy this, if my promi&s;e to my father was violated; there is but one circum&s;tance which could &s;et it a&s;ide, that is having a fortune, that even Lord Cherbury might deem equivalent to your own to bring you; for then my father has often &s;aid he would approve our union; but this is among&s;t the improbabi|lities of this life, and we mu&s;t endeavour to reconcile our&s;elves to the de&s;tiny which &s;eparates us.</P>
<P>I hope your Lord&s;hip will not attempt to &s;ee me again; you mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that your vi&s;its would be highly injurious to me; even the holy and &s;olitary a&s;y|lum which I have found, would not protect me from the malice which has already been &s;o bu&s;y with my peace and fame. Alas! I now need the utmo&s;t vigilance, de|prived as I am of tho&s;e on whom I had claims of protec|tion, it behoves me to exert the utmo&s;t circum&s;pection in my conduct: he in whom I expected to have found a guardian, O&s;car, my dear unfortunate brother, is gone I know not whither, per&s;ecuted and afflicted by the mon|&s;ter who has been &s;uch a &s;ource of mi&s;ery to me. Oh! my Lord, when I think what his &s;ufferings may now be, my heart &s;inks within me: Oh! had I been the only &s;ufferer, I &s;hould not have felt &s;o great a degree of ago|ny as I now endure; but I will not de&s;pair about my dear O&s;car; the Providence which has been &s;o kind to his &s;i&s;ter, which &s;o unexpectedly rai&s;ed her friends, at the moment &s;he deemed her&s;elf deprived of all earthly comfort, may to him have been equally merciful.

I am quitting Ca&s;tle Carberry immediately; I &s;hall leave it with a degree of tranquillity that would perhaps &s;urpri&s;e you, after what has &s;o lately pa&s;&s;ed, if in this one in&s;tance you will oblige your</P>

<P>This laconic letter a&s;toni&s;hed Amanda. By its &s;tyle it was evident Lord Mortimer had recovered his cheer|fulne&s;s, recovered it not from a determination of giving her up, but from a hope of their again meeting, as they could both wi&s;h. A &s;udden tran&s;port ru&s;hed upon her heart at &s;uch an idea, but quickly died away when &s;he reflected it was almo&s;t beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of things to bring about a plea&s;ing interview between them. She knew Lord Mortimer had a &s;anguine temper, and though

it might mi&s;lead him, &s;he re&s;olved it &s;hould not mi&s;&s;ead her. She could not form the mo&s;t di&s;tant &s;urmi&s;e of what he had now in agitation; but whatever it was, &s;he firmly believed it would end in di&s;appointment. To re|fu&s;e every reque&s;t of his was painful, but propriety de|manded &s;he &s;hould not accede to the la&s;t; for one &s;tep &s;he wi&s;ely con&s;idered, from the line of prudence &s;he had marked out for her&s;elf to take, might plunge her in difficulties from which &s;he would find it impo&s;&s;ible to extricate her&s;elf.

<P>I cannot comply with your reque&s;t; you may, if you plea&s;e, repeat inexorable Amanda: I had rather in|cur the imputation of ob&s;tinacy than imprudence, and think it much better to meet your accu&s;ation than de|&s;erve my own. How long I may re&s;ide at St. Catherine's is to my&s;elf unknown; when I quit it, I certainly will not promi&s;e to leave any directions where you may find me.</P>
<P>The ob&s;tacles which have rendered our &s;eparation nece&s;&s;ary, are, I am convinced beyond your Lord&s;hip's power to conquer: except they were removed, any farther interviews between us would be fooli&s;h and imprudent in the extreme. I al&s;o rejoice to hear you are leaving the ca&s;tle, but am not &s;urprized to hear of your tranquil|lity.

<P>Scarcely had &s;he &s;ealed this letter when &s;he was called to dinner; but, though &s;he obeyed the &s;ummons, &s;he could not eat; the exertions her writing to Lord Mor|timer required, and the agitation his letter had thrown

her into, quite exhau&s;ted her &s;trength and &s;pirits. The nuns withdrew &s;oon after dinner, and left her alone with the priore&s;s. In a few minutes after their departure, the old gardner returned from Ca&s;tle Carberry, where he had been delivering her letter. After informing her he had put it &s;afely into his Lord&s;hip's hands, he added, with a look which &s;eemed to indicate a fear le&s;t &s;he &s;hould be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, that he had received neither letter or me&s;&s;age from him, though he waited a long time in expectation of receiving either one or the other; but he &s;uppo&s;ed, he &s;aid, his Lord&s;hip was in too great a hurry ju&s;t then to give any an&s;wer, as a chai&s;e and four was waiting to carry him to Dublin.</P>
<P>Amanda bur&s;t into tears as the man retired from the room. She &s;aw &s;he had written to Lord Mortimer for the la&s;t time, and &s;he could not &s;uppre&s;s this tribute of regret. She was firmly convinced indeed &s;he &s;hould behold him no more. The idea of vi&s;iting her &s;he was &s;ure, nay &s;he hoped, he would relinqui&s;h, when he found, which &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed would &s;oon be the ca&s;e, the &s;chemes or hopes which now buoyed up his &s;pirits impo&s;&s;ible to be realized.</P>
<P>The priore&s;s &s;ympatized in her &s;orrow; though not from her own experience, yet, from the experience of others, &s;he knew how dangerous and bewitching a crea|ture man is, and how difficult it is to remove the chains which he twines around the female heart; to remove tho&s;e which lay &s;o heavy upon the delicate and &s;u&s;cepti|ble heart of her young friend, without leaving a corro|&s;ive wound, was her &s;incere wi&s;h, and by &s;trengthening her re&s;olution, &s;he hoped &s;ucce&s;s would crown their en|deavours.</P>
<P>Two hours were elap&s;ed &s;ince her me&s;&s;enger's return from the ca&s;tle, when &s;i&s;ter Mary entered the room with a large packet, which &s;he put into Amanda's hands, &s;aying, it was given her by Lord Mortimer's &s;ervant, who rode off the moment he delivered it.</P>
<P>Si&s;ter Mary made no &s;cruple of &s;aying, &s;he &s;hould like to know what &s;uch a weighty packet contained. The priore&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> her in a laughing manner for her

curio&s;ity, and drew her into the garden, to give Amanda an opportunity of examining the contents.</P>
<P>She was &s;urprized, on breaking the &s;eal, to perceive a very hand&s;ome pocket book in a blank cover, and found, un&s;ealed, a letter to this effect:</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO MISS FITZALAN.</HEAD>
<P>I have put it out of your power to return this, by departing long ere you receive it. Surely if you have the laudable pride you profe&s;s, you will not he&s;itate to u&s;e the contents of the pocket book, as the only means of avoiding a weight of obligations from &s;trangers; tho' di&s;carded as a lover, &s;urely I may be e&s;teemed as a friend, and with &s;uch a title I will be contented till I can lay claim to a tenderer one. You &s;tart at this la&s;t ex|pre&s;&s;ion, and I have no doubt you will call me a roman|tic vi&s;ionary, for entertaining hopes which you have &s;o po&s;itively a&s;&s;ured me can never be realized; but ere I re&s;ign them I mu&s;t have &s;omething more powerful than this a&s;&s;urance, my &s;weet Amanda, to convince me of their fallacy. I was inexpre&s;&s;ibly &s;hocked this morning to learn by your letter, that your brother had met with misfortune. My blood boils with indignation again&s;t the mon&s;ter who has, to u&s;e your emphatical expre&s;&s;ion, been &s;uch a &s;ource of mi&s;ery to you both. I &s;hall make it my particular care to try and di&s;cover the place to which Mr. Fitzalan is gone, and in what &s;ituation, by means of the agents, or &s;ome of the officers belonging to the regiment, I flatter my&s;elf with being able to gain &s;ome intelligence of him; I need not add, that to the utmo&s;t extent of my power, I will &s;erve him. My &s;uc|ce&s;s in this affair, as well as in that which concerns a much dearer being, you may be convinced you &s;hall &s;oon hear. Adieu, my Amanda, I cannot, &s;ay, like Hamlet, "Go, get you to a nunnery;" but, I can &s;ay&mdash;"Stay there I charge you." Seriou&s;ly, I could wi&s;h, except you find your pre&s;ent &s;ituation very unplea&s;ant and in|convenient, not to change it for a &s;hort time.

<P>"Gracious Heaven!" &s;aid Amanda to her&s;elf, "what can he mean? What &s;cheme can he have in agitation which will remove the ob&s;tacles to our union? He here &s;eems to &s;peak of a certainty of &s;ucce&s;s. Oh? grant, merciful Power!" &s;he continued, rai&s;ing her meek eyes to Heaven, while a ro&s;y blu&s;h &s;tole upon her cheeks, "grant that indeed he may be &s;ucce&s;sful. He talks of returning to Ireland. Still," proceeded &s;he, reading over the letter, "requiring &s;omething more powerful than my a&s;&s;urance to convince him of the fallacy of his hopes; &s;urely Lord Mortimer would not be &s;o cruel as to rai&s;e expectations in my bo&s;om, without tho&s;e in his own were well founded. No, dear Mortimer, I will not call you a romantic vi&s;ionary, but the mo&s;t amiable, the mo&s;t generous of men, who for poor Amanda encounters difficulties, and &s;acrifices every &s;plendid expectation." She rejoiced at the intention he had declared of &s;eeking out O&s;car. She looked forward either to a &s;peedy inter|view, or &s;peedy intelligence of this beloved brother, as &s;he knew Lord Mortimer would &s;eek him with the per|&s;evering &s;pirit of benevolence, and leave no means un|tried to re&s;tore him to her.</P>
<P>She now examined the contents of the pocket Book; it contained a number of &s;mall bills, to the amount of two hundred pounds&mdash;a large pre&s;ent, but one &s;o deli|cately pre&s;ented, that even her ideas of propriety could &s;carcely rai&s;e a &s;cruple again&s;t her accepting it: They did&punc; however, &s;ugge&s;t one, uncertain how matters would

yet terminate between her and Lord Mortimer, &s;he was unwilling to receive any pecuniary obligations from him; but when &s;he reflected on his noble and feeling heart; &s;he knew &s;he &s;hould &s;everely wound it by returning his pre&s;ent, &s;he therefore re&s;olved on keeping it, making a kind of compromi&s;e with her feelings about the matter, by determining that, except entitled to receive them, &s;he would never more accept favours of this nature from his Lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent one indeed was a mo&s;t &s;ea&s;onable relief, and removed from her heart a load of anxiety which had weighed on it. After paying her father's funeral ex|pences, the people with whom he lodged, and the apothecary who had attended him, &s;he found her&s;elf mi&s;tre&s;s of but twenty guineas in the whole world, and more than half of this &s;he con&s;idered as already due to the benevolent &s;i&s;ters of St. Catherine's who were ill able to afford any additional expence.</P>
<P>She had re&s;olved to force them to accept what indeed &s;he deemed a poor return for their kindne&s;s to her, and &s;he then intended to retire to &s;ome ob&s;cure hovel in the neighbourhood, as better &s;uited to the &s;tate of her finan|ces, and continue there till her health was &s;ufficiently re&s;tored, to enable her to make exertion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> for her liveli|hood; but &s;he &s;huddered at the idea of leaving St Ca|therine's, and re&s;iding among&s;t a &s;et of boo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s; &s;he felt &s;en&s;ations &s;omething &s;imilar to tho&s;e we may &s;uppo&s;e a per&s;on would feel, who was about being committed to a tempe&s;tuous ocean without any means of &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer had prevented the nece&s;&s;ity which had prompted her to think of a removal, and &s;he now re&s;olv|ed to re&s;ide at lea&s;t for the time he had mentioned in the convent, during which &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed her uncertainties relative to him would be over, and that, if it was not her fate to be his, &s;he &s;hould, by the perfect re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of her health, be enabled to u&s;e her abilities in the manner her &s;ituation required. Tears of heart felt gratitude and &s;en&s;ibility flowed down her cheeks for him who had lightened her mind of the care which had &s;o oppre&s;&s;ed it.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="038416_0439_1011E5059F82C5C0">
She at length recollected the priore&s;s had retired into the garden from complai&s;ance to her, and yet continued in it, waiting no doubt to be &s;ummoned back by her. She ha&s;tily wiped away her tears, and folding up the precious letter which was bedewed with them, repaired to the garden, re&s;olving not to communicate its contents, as the divulgment of expectations (con&s;idering how lia|ble all human ones are to be di&s;appointed) &s;he ever con|&s;idered a piece of folly.</P>
<P>She found the priore&s;s and &s;i&s;ter Mary &s;eated under a broken and ivy covered arch. "Je&s;u! my dear," &s;aid the latter, "I thought you would never come to us. Our good mother has been keeping me here in &s;pite of my teeth, though I told her the &s;weet cakes I made for tea would be burned by this time, and that, &s;uppo&s;ing you were reading a letter from Lord Mortimer, there could be no harm in my &s;eeing you." Amanda relieved the impatient Mary, and &s;he took her &s;eat. The pri|ore&s;s ca&s;t her piercing eyes upon her. She perceived &s;he had been weeping, and that joy rather than &s;orrow cau|&s;ed her tears. She was too delicate to enquire into its &s;ource; but &s;he took Amanda's hand, and gave it a pre&s;&s;ure, which &s;eemed to &s;ay, "I &s;ee, my dear child, you have met with &s;omething which plea&s;es you, and my heart &s;ympathizes as much in your happine&s;s as in your grief."</P>
<P>Amanda returned the affectionate pre&s;&s;ure with one equally tender, and a &s;tarting tear. They were &s;oon called by &s;i&s;ter Mary to partake of her hot cakes, which &s;he had made indeed in hopes of tempting Amanda to eat after her bad dinner; the whole community were a&s;&s;em|bled at tea, when the Doctor entered the parlour, Aman|da blu&s;hed, and looked grave at his fir&s;t entrance; but he &s;oon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> her out of her gravity, and when the pri|ore&s;s and the nuns, according to cu&s;tom, had withdrawn to evening ve&s;pers, he &s;aid, with a &s;ignificant &s;mile, "he feared &s;he had not attended as much as he wi&s;hed &s;he &s;hould, to the contents of the book he had la&s;t brought her." She &s;aw by his manner he was acquainted with her &s;ituation relative to Lord Mortimer, and therefore
<PB N="40" REF="038416_0440_1011E5080A785FC8">
replied by &s;aying, "that, perhaps, if he knew the motives which influenced her conduct, he would not think her wrong in di&s;regarding what he had ju&s;t mentioned."&mdash;She al&s;o &s;aid, "&s;he dete&s;ted all kinds of &s;tratagems, and was really di&s;plea&s;ed with him for practi&s;ing one upon her."</P>
<P>"In a good cau&s;e," he &s;aid, "he &s;hould never he&s;i|tate u&s;ing one. Lord Mortimer was the fine&s;t young fellow he had ever &s;een, and had won his favour, and the be&s;t wi&s;hes of his heart, from the fir&s;t moment that he beheld him. He made me contrive." continued the doctor, "a &s;tory to gain admi&s;&s;ion to your Lady&s;hip, and when I found him &s;o dreadfully anxious about you, I gave you credit (as I had then no opportunity of judging for my&s;elf) for all the virtues and graces he a&s;cribed to you, and which I have &s;ince perceived you to po&s;&s;e&s;s. You &s;mile, and look as if you would call me a flatterer; &s;eri|ou&s;ly I a&s;&s;ure you I am not one: I really think you wor|thy of Lord Mortimer, and, I a&s;&s;ure you that is as great a compliment as could be paid any woman. His mind was troubled with grief; he revealed his troubles and perplexities to me, and after hearing them, no good Chri&s;tian ever prayed more devoutly for another than I prayed for your recovery, that all your &s;orrows like a no|vel, might terminate in marriage."</P>
<P>"You are obliging in your wi&s;hes," &s;aid Amanda, &s;miling.</P>
<P>"Faith, I am &s;incere in them," exclaimed he, "and do not know when I have been &s;o di&s;concerted at things not turning out &s;moothly between you and his Lord&s;hip; but I will not de&s;pair: In all my own troubles, and Heaven has given me my &s;hare, I ever looked to the bright &s;ide of things, and &s;hall always do &s;o for my friends. I yet expect to &s;ee you &s;ettled at Ca&s;tle Carberry, and to be appointed my&s;elf phy&s;ician general to your Lady&s;hip's hou&s;ehold." The mention of an event, yet &s;o uncertain greatly agitated Amanda, &s;he blu&s;hed and turned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> alternately, and convinced her good natured but loqua|cious friend, he had touched a chord which could not bear vibration. He ha&s;tily changed the di&s;cour&s;e, and
<PB N="41" REF="038416_0441_1011E5099CBE8928">
as &s;oon as he &s;aw her compo&s;ed, ro&s;e to take his leave.&mdash;Amanda detained him for a minute, to try and prevail on him to take a ten guinea note; but he was inflexible, and &s;aid, with &s;ome archne&s;s, "till the di&s;order which prey|ed upon Lord Mortimer's heart, was in &s;ome degree alle|viated, he would receive no recompen&s;e for his vi&s;its, which he a&s;&s;ured Amanda, from time to time, he &s;hould continue to pay her, adding, a certain per&s;on had enjoined him now and then to take a peep within the holy walls of St. Catherine's."</P>
<P>The next morning Amanda &s;et about a temporary ar|rangement of her affairs. She pre&s;ented thirty guineas to the &s;i&s;terhood, which, with much difficulty &s;he forced them to accept, though in reality it was much required by them; but when &s;he came to &s;peak of paying for a continuance, they po&s;itively declared they would agree to no &s;uch thing, as &s;he had already &s;o liberally rewarded them for any expence they had incurred on her account. She told them, that if they would not agree to be paid for lodging and board, &s;he would certainly leave them; though &s;uch a &s;tep was contrary to her inclinations, &s;he a&s;&s;ured them al&s;o &s;he was at pre&s;ent well able to pay.</P>
<P>At la&s;t it was &s;ettled &s;he &s;hould give them at the rate of forty pounds a year&mdash;a &s;alary they thought extremely ample, con&s;idering the plain manner in which they lived. She then had all the things which belonged to her father and her&s;elf brought to the convent, and had the former, with whatever &s;he did not immediately want, nailed up in a large che&s;t, that on a &s;hort notice they might be removed. Her harp and guittar &s;he had in her di&s;tre&s;s propo&s;ed &s;ending back to the per&s;on in Dublin from whom they were purcha&s;ed, to &s;ell for her; but &s;he now deter|mined to keep tho&s;e pre&s;ents of her beloved father's, ex|cept again urged by nece&s;&s;ity to part with them. She had a variety of materials for painting and working, and propo&s;ed employing her&s;elf in executing pieces in each way, not only as a means of amu&s;ing her time, but as a re&s;ource on an evil day. Thus wi&s;ely making u&s;e of the pre&s;ent &s;un&s;hine, le&s;t another &s;torm &s;hould ari&s;e, which &s;he &s;hould not be &s;o well able to &s;truggle again&s;t.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE turbulence of grief, and the agitation of &s;u&s;pence, gradually le&s;&s;ened in the mind of Amanda, and were &s;ucceeded by a &s;oft and plea&s;ing melancholy, which &s;prang from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having always, to the be&s;t of her abilities, performed the duties impo&s;|ed upon her, and &s;upported her misfortunes with placid re&s;ignation. She loved to think on her father, for amid&s;t her &s;ighs for his lo&s;s were mingled the delightful ideas of having ever been a &s;ource of comfort to him, and &s;he believed, if departed &s;pirits were allowed to review this world, his would look down upon her with delight and approbation at beholding her undeviating in the path he marked out for her to take; the calm derived from &s;uch meditations &s;he con&s;idered as a recompence for many &s;orrows, it was &s;uch indeed as nothing earthly gives, or can de&s;troy, and what the good mu&s;t ever experience, though "amid&s;t the wreck of matter, and the cru&s;h of worlds."</P>
<P>She tried to prevent her thoughts from wandering to Lord Mortimer, as the &s;ure&s;t means of retaining her compo&s;ure, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> whenever &s;he reflected on the doubtful balance in which her fate yet hung concerning him.</P>
<P>The &s;olitude of St. Catherine's was well adapted to her pre&s;ent &s;ituation and frame of mind. She was nei|ther <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eized with impertinent o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> unmeaning ceremony, but perfect mi&s;tre&s;s of her own time and actions, read, worked and walked, as mo&s;t agreeable to her&s;elf. She did not extend her walks beyond the convent, as the &s;cenes around it would awaken remembrances &s;he had
<PB N="43" REF="038416_0443_1011E50F972BFDD8">
not &s;ufficient fortitude to bear; but the &s;pace it covered was ample enough to afford her many different and ex|ten&s;ive rambles; and of a &s;till evening, when nothing but the lowing of the cattle, or the buzzing of the &s;um|mer flies, was to be heard, &s;he loved to wander through the &s;olemn and romantic ruins, &s;ometimes accompanied by a nun, but much oftener alone.</P>
<P>A fortnight had elap&s;ed in this manner &s;ince Lord Mortimer's departure, when one morning a carriage was heard driving acro&s;s the Common, and &s;topping at the outer gate of St. Catherine's: Amanda, who was &s;itting at work in the parlour with the priore&s;s, &s;tarted in an univer&s;al trepidation at the &s;ound; it may be ea&s;i|ly imagined the idea of Lord Mortimer was uppermo&s;t in her thoughts; the door opened in a few minutes, and to her great a&s;toni&s;hment Mrs. Kilcorban and her two daughters made their appearance.</P>
<P>Agitation and &s;urprize prevented Amanda from &s;peak|ing; &s;he courti&s;ed, and motioned them to be &s;eated. The young ladies &s;aluted her with an icy civility, and the mother treated her with a rude familiarity, which &s;he thought her&s;elf authorized in u&s;ing to one &s;o redu|ced in circum&s;tances as Amanda. "Dear me," cried &s;he, "you can't think, child, how &s;hocked we have all been to hear of your misfortunes! We only returned to the country ye&s;terday, for we have been in town the whole winter, and to be &s;ure a mo&s;t delightful winter we have had of it, &s;uch balls, &s;uch routs, &s;uch racketings; but as I was going to &s;ay, as &s;oon as we came home I began, according to my old cu&s;tom, to enquire after all my neighbours, and to be &s;ure the very fir&s;t thing I heard was of the poor Captain's death. Don't cry, my dear, we mu&s;t all go one time or another, tho&s;e are things of cour&s;e, as the Doctor &s;ays in his &s;ermon; &s;o when I heard of your father's death, and your di&s;tre&s;s, I began to ca&s;t about in my brain &s;ome plan for helping you, and at la&s;t I hit upon one, which, &s;ays I to the girls, will delight the poor &s;oul, as it will give her an opportunity of earning decent bread for her&s;elf.

<P>The indignation which filled Amanda's brea&s;t at reading this &s;croll, cannot be expre&s;&s;ed. Her blood &s;eemed to boil in her veins; it was &s;ometime ere &s;he could &s;ufficiently compo&s;e her&s;elf to acquaint the prior|e&s;s with the cau&s;e of her agitation; it was then agreed that the letter &s;hould be returned, with the following lines written on it:</P>
<P>"The author of this effu&s;ion of ignorance and im|pertinence, has already in&s;pired all the contempt he merits; &s;hould he repeat his in&s;olence, &s;omething even more mortifying than contempt, cha&s;ti&s;ement mu&s;t en&s;ue."</P>
<P>That a repetition of this kind would be the ca&s;e &s;he did not believe. From Kilcorban &s;he had no rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect either the per&s;everance or de&s;igns of Belgrave;

one was a libertine from principle, the other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> be|lieved from fa&s;hion, and that, to pique his pride, would be a &s;ure method of getting rid of him.</P>
<P>But the calm &s;he had for &s;ome time experienced was de&s;tined to be interrupted. The next morning brought father O'Gallaghan, the little fat prie&s;t (of whom we have made mention before in our pages) to the convent; he was not the officiating prie&s;t, but notwith&s;tanding this, paid many vi&s;its to the &s;i&s;terhood, with whom he was a great favourite; he had been much concerned about Amanda's illne&s;s. She was &s;itting alone in the parlour, drawing, when he entered it. He &s;eated him|&s;elf by her, and the expre&s;&s;ion of his countenance &s;eemed to declare his heart was brimful of &s;omething plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>"You won't be offended now, my dear &s;owl," &s;aid he, &s;mirking up in her face, "with a body for a&s;king you how you would like to leave this di&s;mal &s;olitude, and have a comfortable home of your own, where you might &s;ee your own friends, and have every thing warm and co&s;y about you?"</P>
<P>"Why," &s;aid Amanda, "though I do not con&s;ider this a di&s;mal &s;olitude, yet to be &s;ure I &s;hould have no objection to a plea&s;ant &s;ettled habitation."</P>
<P>"Aye, I always thought you a &s;en&s;ible young body. Well, and what would you &s;ay to the per&s;on then who could point out &s;uch an habitation? Aye, you little rogue, who could &s;ay they had ju&s;t &s;uch a one in their eye for you?"</P>
<P>Amanda &s;tared at him with a&s;toni&s;hment. She had at fir&s;t believed him je&s;ting, but now found him &s;erious.</P>
<P>"Aye faith, my dear creature," cried he continuing his di&s;cour&s;e, with a look of the mo&s;t perfect &s;atisfaction, "I have an offer to make you, which, I believe, would make many girls jump out of their &s;kins with joy to hear."</P>
<P>"You remember the O'Flannaghans I am &s;ure, where you took tea la&s;t &s;ummer.

They have every thing &s;nug about them. The old man will give every thing into your &s;pou&s;e's hands; the younge&s;t &s;on will live in the hou&s;e till he gets married, and goes off to a farm of his own; the elde&s;t daughter is married; the &s;econd will live with her, and the younge&s;t will be a little handy a&s;&s;i&s;tant to you: So you &s;ee you will not be tormented with a large family. There is one little matter which to be &s;ure they are a little unea&s;y about, and that is your being of different per&s;ua&s;ions; but &s;ays I to them when this was &s;tarted&mdash;faith, &s;ays I, you need not give your|&s;elf any trouble about it, for I know the young woman to be a di&s;creet &s;owl, and I am &s;ure &s;he will make no he&s;itation about going to Chapel in&s;tead of Church, when &s;he knows too, it is for her own intere&s;t: So, my dear &s;owl, I hope &s;oon to give you the nuptial bene|diction, and to be al&s;o your &s;piritual director."</P>
<P>Amanda had li&s;tened to his &s;peech in &s;ilent ama&s;ement. She now ro&s;e and would have quitted the room without &s;peaking to evince her contempt, had not an idea darted into her mind, that &s;uch conduct, perhaps, might not be con&s;trued by the ignorant prie&s;t, in the manner &s;he wi&s;hed; &s;he therefore &s;topped, and turning to him &s;aid, "He could not wonder at her being offended at his pretending to an&s;wer &s;o freely for her in matters &s;o important as religion; but to prove how pre&s;umptu|ous he was in every thing he &s;aid about her, &s;he mu&s;t a&s;&s;ure him his emba&s;&s;y to her was equally fruitle&s;s and di&s;agreeable; and that if Mr. O'Flanaghan con&s;ulted his own happine&s;s, he would &s;eek to unite him&s;elf with a woman brought up in his own &s;phere of life." So &s;ay|ing, &s;he quitted the room with a look of dignity which quite confounded the poor prie&s;t, who &s;natched up his hat in a great hurry, and waddled away to the farm, to communicate the ill &s;ucce&s;s of his vi&s;it, which had quite cru&s;hed his expectations of wedding pre&s;ents and pud|ding

fea&s;ts, which he had contemplated in idea with delight.</P>
<P>It was &s;ome time ere Amanda recovered from the di&s;|compo&s;ure into which the impertinence of the Kil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">|bans and the prie&s;t had thrown her.

<P>BUT a &s;hock more &s;evere than tho&s;e &s;he had lately experienced, was yet in &s;tore for our haple&s;s heroine. About a fortnight after the vi&s;it of the Kil|corban's and the prie&s;t, as &s;he was rambling one eve|ning according to cu&s;tom among&s;t the &s;olitary ruins of St. Catherine's, indulging the pen&s;ive meditations of her &s;oul, the figure of a man &s;uddenly darted from under a broken arch, and di&s;covered to her view the features of the hated Belgrave. Amanda gave a feint cry, and in unutterable di&s;may tottered back a few paces again&s;t a wall. Cruel Amanda, exclaimed Belgrave, while his look &s;eemed to imply he would take advantage of her &s;ituation; his look, his voice, operated like a charm to rou&s;e her from the kind of &s;tupefaction into which &s;he had fallen at fir&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of him, and as he attempted to lay hold of her &s;he &s;prang pa&s;t him, and, with a &s;wift|ne&s;s which mocked his &s;peed, flew through the intricate
<PB N="50" REF="038416_0450_1011E522E596FC60">
windings of the place till &s;he reached the convent. Her pale and di&s;tracted look, as &s;he ru&s;hed into the priore&s;s's apartment, terrified the good old lady, who ha&s;tily in|terrogated her as to the cau&s;e of her di&s;order; but A|manda was unable to &s;peak. The appearance of Bel|grave &s;he thought an omen of every ill to her. Her blood run cold through her veins at his &s;ight, and terror totally &s;ubdued her powers. The priore&s;s &s;ummoned &s;i&s;ter Mary to her relief, drops and water were admini&s;|tered, and the over-loaded heart of the trembling Aman|da was relieved by tears. The priore&s;s again a&s;ked the cau&s;e of her agitation, but perceiving Amanda did not like to &s;peak before &s;i&s;ter Mary, &s;he immediately pre|tended to think it proceeded from fatigue; and Mary, who was &s;implicity it&s;elf, readily credited the idea. The Priore&s;s &s;oon &s;ent her upon &s;ome pretext from the room, and then in the gentle&s;t terms, begged to know what had &s;o cruelly alarmed her young friend. Amanda had already confided to the Priore&s;s the events of her life, &s;o that the good lady, on hearing Belgrave now mentioned, no longer wondered at the agitation of Amanda, yet as her fears &s;he &s;aw were too powerful for her rea&s;on, &s;he endeavoured to convince her they were unnece&s;&s;ary. She called to her remembrance the &s;ingular protection &s;he had already experienced from heaven, and the protection which, while &s;he was innocent, &s;he would &s;till have a right to expect. She al&s;o mentioned the &s;ecurity of her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, encompa&s;&s;ed by friends who&s;e integri|ty could not be warped, and who&s;e utmo&s;t zeal would be manife&s;ted in defeating any &s;tratagems which might be laid again&s;t her.</P>
<P>Amanda grew compo&s;ed as &s;he li&s;tened to the prior|e&s;s; &s;he was cheered by the voice of piety and friend|&s;hip, and her heart again felt firm and elevated. She ac|knowledged that, after the &s;ingular, nay, almo&s;t miracu|lous interpo&s;itions of Providence &s;he had experienced in her favour, to give way to terror or de&s;pair, was &s;inful, &s;ince it &s;hewed a di&s;tru&s;t of the Power, who has pro|mi&s;ed, with guardian care, to watch the foot&s;teps of the innocent.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="038416_0451_1011E5247506DFF8">
It was however agreed that Amanda &s;hould venture no more from the Convent, but confine her rambles to the garden, which was enclo&s;ed with a high wall, and had no places of concealment. Five weeks yet remained of the period Lord Mortimer had reque&s;ted her to &s;tay at St. Catherine's; before it was expired, &s;he tru&s;ted and believed Belgrave would be weary of watching her, and would decamp; if then &s;he neither &s;aw no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> heard from Lord Mortimer, &s;he re&s;olved to relinqui&s;h all hope con|cerning him, and immediately think upon &s;ome plan, which &s;hould put her in a way of procuring &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>Her paintings and embroidery &s;till went on; &s;he had executed &s;ome elegant pictures in both, which, if obli|ged to di&s;po&s;e of, &s;he was &s;ure would fetch a good price&punc; yet, whenever compelled by reflection to this idea, the tear of tender melancholy would fall upon her lovely cheek, a tear which was ever ha&s;tily wiped away, while &s;he endeavoured to fortify her mind with pious re&s;igna|tion to whatever &s;hould be her future fate.</P>
<P>Three weeks more elap&s;ed without any event to di&s;|compo&s;e their tranquillity; but as the termination of the de&s;tined period approached, the agitation of Aman|da, in &s;pite of all her efforts to the contrary, increa&s;ed; &s;he deemed the awful cri&s;is of her fate at hand, and &s;he trembled at the reflection.</P>
<P>She now, for the fir&s;t time, avoided &s;olitude; &s;he wanted to fly from her&s;elf, and &s;at con&s;tantly with the Priore&s;s, who had nothing of the gloomy reclu&s;e, &s;ave the habit about her.</P>
<P>They were chatting together one evening after tea, when &s;i&s;ter Mary entered the room, bearing a large pacquet, which &s;he rather to&s;&s;ed than pre&s;ented to Amanda, exclaiming, "From Lord Mortimer&mdash;I wi&s;h the trouble&s;ome fellow had not come back again; here we &s;hall have him fri&s;king or &s;torming continually, and again plaguing us out of our lives."</P>
<P>"From Lord Mortimer!" exclaimed Amanda, &s;tart|ing from her chair, and cla&s;ping the letter between her hand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, "Oh! gracious heaven!" She &s;aid no more, but flew from the room to her chamber. She <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> open the
<PB N="52" REF="038416_0452_1011E52719CDB680">
&s;eal; the envelop contained two letters, the fir&s;t was di|rected in a hand unknown to her; her heart &s;ickened as &s;he dropped it on the ground; the other was the &s;uper|&s;cription of Lord Mortimer. She opened it with reviv|ed &s;pirits, and read as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO MISS FITZALAN.</HEAD>
<P>"I am returned, returned to tell my Amanda that nothing but the awful fiat of heaven &s;hall part us more. Yes, my love, a &s;weet reward for all our difficulties our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, let me add, our per&s;evering con&s;tancy, is at hand, and one name, one intere&s;t, one fate, I tru&s;t, will &s;oon be our's."</P>
<P>Tears of joy gu&s;hed from Amanda as &s;he exclaim|ed, "Can this, can this be true? Is Lord Mortimer &s;o long&punc; &s;o hopele&s;sly beloved, indeed returned to tell me we &s;hall part no more? 'Tis true, 'tis true, and never can my grateful heart &s;ufficiently acknowledge the goodne&s;s it experiences; but how was this event brought about? She wiped away her tears, and re&s;umed the letter.</P>
<P>Your &s;olemn refu&s;al to unite your&s;elf to me threw me into agonies; but true love, like true courage, will never de&s;pair, will never yield to difficulties, without fir&s;t trying every effort to conquer them: I &s;oon there|fore rou&s;ed my&s;elf from the heavy weight which oppre&s;|&s;ed my &s;pirits at your re&s;olution, and ere long conceived a project &s;o fea&s;ible, &s;o almo&s;t certain of &s;ucce&s;s, that my impatience to realize it cannot be de&s;cribed; yet you may conceive &s;ome idea of it from the abrupt manner in which I quitted Ca&s;tle Carberry, without de&s;iring to bid you adieu; but ere it could be accompli&s;hed, I plain|ly &s;aw I had many difficulties to encounter, difficulties which it was ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential to overcome, that I might prove to the world I was not the dupe of love; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he friend, the lover, and the vindicator of real in|nocence and virtue. From what I have &s;aid, you may &s;uppo&s;e the difficulties I allude to were &s;uch as I expect|ed to encounter in my attempt to unravel the whole of the deep and execrable plot which involved you in a

&s;ituation &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to your feelings, and injurious to your character; and, oh! with what mingled pride and plea&s;ure did I meditate on being your champion, clearing your fame from each dark a&s;per&s;ion, and prov|ing, clearly proving, that your mind was as lovely, as angelic, as your per&s;on!</P>
<P>I was happy, on my arrival in London, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> La|dy Martha Dormer &s;till at Lord Cherbury's hou&s;e. I have already told you that I left town on pretence of vi&s;iting my &s;i&s;ter in Wales. My father, I &s;oon perceiv|ed, &s;u&s;pected that had not been the real motive of my departure; but I &s;oon perceived he did not de&s;ire to re|veal his &s;u&s;picions, as he a&s;ked me &s;ome que&s;tions con|cerning Lady Araminta, which you may be &s;ure I an|&s;wered aukwardly enough, and, had a comic writer been pre&s;ent, he might have taken the hint of a good blun|dering &s;cene from us both.</P>
<P>The Marquis of Ro&s;line and his family I learned continued at his villa; their ab&s;ence from town rejoiced me, as it not only exempted me from &s;ociety I abhorred, but as it gave me an opportunity of interrogating their hou&s;ehold, among&s;t whom I was convinced I &s;hould di&s;|cover the tru&s;ty agents the amiable Marchione&s;s had made u&s;e of in her &s;cheme again&s;t you. The morning after my arrival, I accordingly &s;et off to Portman Square: the man who opened the door knew me not, which I con&s;idered a lucky circum&s;tance, for not being able to mention my name to the hou&s;ekeeper, whom I de&s;ired him to &s;end to me, &s;he was not as much on her guard as &s;he would otherwi&s;e have been:&mdash;She &s;tarted as &s;he en|tered the parlour, and lifted up her hands and eyes with unfeigned a&s;toni&s;hment.

I &s;oon gave her to under&s;tand it was not of the mo&s;t amicable kind to her; I came, I &s;aid, to de|mand either the letter, or an account of the letter which

I had entru&s;ted to her care for Mi&s;s Fitzalan, which con|tained a note of large value, and which I found had ne|ver been received by that young lady. Her countenance in a moment condemned her: it &s;poke &s;tronger than a thou&s;and tongues again&s;t her. She fir&s;t grew deadly pale, then fiery red, trembled, faltered, and hung her head to avoid my eyes. Her looks I told her confirmed the &s;u&s;picions I was forced to entertain of her integrity, yet, &s;hocking as the action was which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he had commit|ted, being not only a breach of tru&s;t, but humanity, I was willing to come to an ea&s;y and private accommoda|tion about it, provided &s;he would truly and fully confe&s;s the part &s;he had taken, or knew others to have taken, in injuring Mi&s;s Fitzalan, while &s;he re&s;ided in the Mar|quis's hou&s;e, by bringing Colonel Belgrave into it. I pau&s;ed for her reply. She appeared as if con&s;idering how &s;he &s;hould act. I thought I &s;aw &s;omething yield|ing in her face, and eager to take advantage of it. I proceeded: What I have already &s;aid, I am going again to repeat; that is, if you confe&s;s all you know relative to the plot which was contrived, and carried into execu|tion in this hou&s;e again&s;t Mi&s;s Fitzalan, I will &s;ettle every thing relative to the letter, and its contents, in a manner plea&s;ing to you. Her innocence is unque&s;|tioned by me; but it is e&s;&s;ential to her peace that it &s;hould al&s;o be &s;o to the re&s;t of her friends, and they who regard her welfare will liberally reward tho&s;e, who&s;e al|legations &s;hall ju&s;tify her.</P>
<P>Upon this &s;he turned to me, with a countenance of the utmo&s;t effrontery, and &s;aid &s;he would not tell a lie to plea&s;e any one. I will not &s;hock you by repeating all &s;he &s;aid: &s;he ended by &s;aying, as to the letters &s;he &s;et me at defiance; true, I had given her one for Mi&s;s Fitz|alan, but I might remember Mi&s;s Fitzalan was in a fit on the ground at the time, and &s;he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in other &s;ervant, to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;he &s;aid, and in the hurry and bu&s;tle which en&s;ued, &s;he knew not what became of it, others might as well be called upon as her. I could no longer command my temper: I told her &s;he was a wretch, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> for the diabolical &s;ervice in which &s;he was
<PB N="55" REF="038416_0455_1011E52F25594B68">
employed. The note, which I enclo&s;ed in the letter I had given her for you, I had received from my father's agent in the country, as a po&s;t note I had endor&s;ed it, and taken the number in my pocket book; I therefore left Portman Square with a re&s;olution of going to the Bank, and, if not already received, &s;topping payment, I &s;tepped into the fir&s;t hackney-coach I met, and had the &s;atisfaction of finding it had not been offered at the Bank. I &s;u&s;pected &s;he would be glad to exchange it for ca&s;h as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and therefore left my direction, as well as a reque&s;t for the detention of any per&s;on who &s;hould pre&s;ent it.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this a clerk came the following morning, to inform me a woman had pre&s;ented the note at the Bank, and was, agreeable to my reque&s;t, detain|ed till I appeared. I immediately returned with him, and had the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing the hou&s;e-keeper caught in the &s;nare. She bur&s;t into tears at my ap|pearance, and coming up to me, in a low voice, &s;aid, if I would have mercy upon her, &s;he would in return make a full confe&s;&s;ion of all &s;he knew about the affair I had mentioned to her ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>I told her though &s;he de&s;erved no mercy, yet, as I had promi&s;ed on &s;uch condition to &s;hew her lenity, I would not violate my word. I received the note, &s;ent for a coach, and handing the lady into it, &s;oon conveyed her to Portman Square. She no &s;ooner entered the par|lour than &s;he fell on her knees, and be&s;ought my for|givene&s;s. I bid her ri&s;e, and lo&s;e no time in revealing all &s;he knew concerning the &s;cheme again&s;t you. She then confe&s;&s;ed, that both &s;he and Mrs. Jane, the at|tendant who had been placed about your per&s;on, were acquainted and concerned in all the contrivances the Marchione&s;s had laid again&s;t you, who &s;crupled not in acknowledging to them the inveterate hatred &s;he bore you.

added &s;he had never kept; but this brief and uncircum|&s;tancial account was by no means &s;atisfactory to me. I called for materials for writing, and in&s;i&s;ted &s;he &s;hould, to the be&s;t of her recollection, relate every word or cir|cum&s;tance which had ever pa&s;&s;ed between her and the Marchione&s;s, and their other a&s;&s;ociate, relative to you. She he&s;itated at this. On tho&s;e terms only, I &s;aid, I would grant her my forgivene&s;s, and by her complying with them, not only that, but a liberal recompen&s;e &s;hould be her's. This la&s;t promi&s;e had the de&s;ired ef|fect; &s;he laid open indeed a &s;cene of complicated ini|quity, related the manner in which Colonel Belgrave was brought into the hou&s;e by her and Mrs. Jane, how they had &s;tationed them&s;elves in a place of con|cealment to li&s;ten, by which means they knew what pa&s;&s;ed between you, which &s;he now, in almo&s;t the very &s;ame words you made u&s;e of, repeated to me: as &s;he &s;poke I wrote it, and made her &s;ign the paper under a paragraph, purporting that it was a true confe&s;&s;ion of the part &s;he had taken, and knew others to have taken, in attempting to injure Mi&s;s Fitzalan.</P>
<P>I now mentioned Mrs. Jane, who&s;e evidence I wi&s;hed for to corroborate her's. This &s;he a&s;&s;ured me I might procure by promi&s;ing a reward, as Mrs Jane was much di&s;&s;atisfied with the Marchione&s;s and Lady Eu|phra&s;ia, neither of whom had recompen&s;ed her as &s;he expected, for her faithful &s;ervices to them. She was now at the villa; but the hou&s;e-keeper added, that &s;he would &s;trike out &s;ome expedient to bring her to town in the cour&s;e of the week, and would inform me imme|diately of her arrival. I told her the affair of the note &s;hould be no more mentioned, and gave a bill for fifty pounds as the reward I had promi&s;ed, and &s;he eagerly expected. I told her &s;he might promi&s;e a &s;imilar one in my name to Mrs. Jane, provided &s;he al&s;o told truth. I al&s;o told her I would take care &s;he &s;hould &s;uffer no di&s;tre&s;s by quitting the Marquis's family, which &s;he lamented would be the con&s;equence of what &s;he had done.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="038416_0457_1011E533821128D8">
Mrs. Jane did not come to town as &s;oon as I ex|pected; but on receiving a &s;ummons to inform me of her arrival I ha&s;tened to the hou&s;e like an inqui&s;itor ge|neral with my &s;croll, prepared to take the confe&s;&s;ion of the fair culprit, which exactly corre&s;ponded with the hou&s;e-keeper's, and I had the felicity of &s;eeing her &s;ub|&s;cribe her name to it. I gave her the promi&s;ed recom|pen&s;e mo&s;t cheerfully, as I had not half &s;o much trouble in making her tell truth, as I had with the hou&s;e-keeper. Mrs. Jennings, your old landlady, and Lady Grey|&s;tock's faithful friend, was the next and la&s;t per&s;on who&s;e malice I wanted to refute. I made my &s;ervant enquire her character in the neighbourhood, and learned it was con&s;idered a very &s;u&s;picious one. I went to her one morning in my carriage, well knowing that the appear|ance of rank and &s;plendour would have a greater weight in influencing a being like her to ju&s;tice than any plea of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. She appeared lo&s;t in a&s;toni&s;h|ment and confu&s;ion at my vi&s;it, and I &s;aw waited with trembling expectation to have the rea&s;on of it revealed. I kept her not long in &s;u&s;pence. I was the friend, I told her, of a young lady, who&s;e character &s;he had vilely and fal&s;ely a&s;per&s;ed. Her con&s;cience I told her I believed would whi&s;per to her heart the name of this lady, and &s;end its crim&s;on current to her face at the mention of Mi&s;s Fitzalan.</P>
<P>The wretch &s;eemed ready to &s;ink to the earth. I repeated to her all &s;he had &s;aid concerning you to Lady Grey&s;tock. I told her of the con&s;equences of defama|tion, and declared &s;he might expect the utmo&s;t rigour of the law, except &s;he confe&s;&s;ed her a&s;&s;ertions were in|famous fal&s;hoods, and the motives which in&s;tigated her to them. She trembled with terror, and &s;upplicated mercy: I de&s;ired her to de&s;erve it by her confe&s;&s;ion. She then acknowledged &s;he had gro&s;sly and cruelly wronged you, by what &s;he had &s;aid to Lady Grey&s;tock, and that &s;he had many opportunities of being convinced, while you re&s;ided in her hou&s;e, that your virtue and in|nocence were of the pure&s;t nature; but that &s;he was provoked to &s;peak maliciou&s;ly again&s;t you from re&s;ent|ment

at lo&s;ing all the rich gifts Colonel Belgrave had promi&s;ed her, if &s;he brought you to comply with his wi&s;hes.

<P>The period for mentioning my project was now ar|rived: I de&s;ired the morning after my vi&s;it to Mrs. Jennings, to be indulged in a tete-a-tete in Lady Mar|tha's dre&s;&s;ing room: I believe &s;he half gue&s;&s;ed what the &s;ubject of it would be; &s;he &s;aw by my countenance there was joyful news at hand. I &s;hall not recapitulate our conver&s;ation; &s;uffice it to &s;ay, that her excellent feeling heart participated largely in my &s;atisfaction: it did more than participate, it wi&s;hed to increa&s;e it, and ere I could mention my project, &s;he declared my Amanda &s;hould henceforth be con&s;idered as her adopted daughter, and &s;hould from her receive &s;uch a fortune as &s;uch a title claimed; Yes, my Amanda, the fortune &s;he ever de&s;|tined for me, &s;he &s;aid &s;he &s;hould now con&s;ecrate to the purpo&s;e of procuring me a trea&s;ure the mo&s;t valuable Heaven could be&s;tow&mdash;the riche&s;t&mdash;the mo&s;t valuable indeed&mdash;a trea&s;ure dearer, far dearer to my &s;oul for all the dangers it has encountered.

feet in a tran&s;port of gratitude, and acknowledged that &s;he had anticipated what I was going to &s;ay, as I had been determined to throw my&s;elf on her genero&s;ity from the time I was convinced of your inflexible re&s;olution, not to unite your&s;elf to me without you brought a fortune.</P>
<P>It was now agreed we &s;hould keep Lord Cherbury a little longer ignorant of our intentions; we propo&s;ed taking the Marchione&s;s and Lady Euphra&s;ia by &s;urprize, and hoped by &s;o doing, to be able to remove from his eyes the mi&s;t which partiality had hitherto &s;pread before them, to ob&s;cure the defects of the above mentioned ladies.</P>
<P>He had hinted more than once his wi&s;hes for my paying my compliments at the Marquis's villa. I now propo&s;ed going thither my&s;elf the en&s;uing day. He looked equally &s;urpri&s;ed and plea&s;ed: At this propo&s;al Lady Martha agreed to accompany <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and his Lord&s;hip, you may be &s;ure, determined to be one of the party, that he might &s;upply the deficiencies of his &s;on, which he had heretofore found pretty manife&s;t in &s;uch &s;ociety.</P>
<P>We had the happine&s;s to find all the family at home when we reached the villa. The ladies all expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves delighted at my unexpected appearance, and quite charmed by my recovered looks. The Marquis with his u&s;ual &s;ang froid declared him&s;elf glad to &s;ee me.

<P>I &s;aid, (addre&s;&s;ing the Marchione&s;s) I now tru&s;ted the re&s;entment her Lady&s;hip entertained again&s;t her un|offending

niece was &s;ufficiently appea&s;ed by what &s;he had made her &s;uffer, and that &s;he would rather rejoice than regret the opportunity which pre&s;ented it&s;elf of vindicating her fame. I wi&s;hed, I &s;aid, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to &s;pare her Lady&s;hip's feelings, and provided, &s;he would clear Mi&s;s Fitzalan from the obloquy, which the tran&s;actions in her hou&s;e ca&s;t upon her, I was willing to conceal the &s;hare her Lady&s;hip had in them. In a voice of &s;mothered rage, and with a look into which &s;he thew as much contempt as po&s;&s;ible, &s;he replied, "She thanked me for the attention I profe&s;&s;ed my&s;elf inclined to pay her feelings; but &s;he fancied I had overlooked all inclination of this kind, when I undertook to bribe her &s;ervants to a&s;per&s;e her character, that Mi&s;s Fitzalan's might be cleared.

<P>"You &s;ee, my Lord, (exclaimed the Marchione&s;s, turning to Lord Cherbury) Lord Mortimer acknow|ledges his pa&s;&s;ion for this wretched girl."</P>

<P>"I followed her my Lord (I replied) in hope to withdraw her from her &s;educer's arms, and place her in her father's.

I &s;aw her at the &s;olemn hour which con&s;igned her parent to his grave, and to have doubted her prote&s;tations of innocence then, would have been almo&s;t impious.

My &s;ucce&s;s in their developement has been beyond my expectations; but Providence is on the &s;ide of &s;uffering virtue, and a&s;&s;i&s;ts tho&s;e who &s;tand up in its &s;upport."</P>
<P>"Contrary to my fir&s;t intention, my dear Amanda, I have given you a &s;ketch of part of our conver&s;ation: For the remainder it &s;hall &s;uffice to &s;ay, that the Mar|chione&s;s per&s;evered in declaring I had bribed her &s;er|vant to blacken her character, in order to clear Mi&s;s Fitzalan's, an attempt &s;he repeatedly a&s;&s;ured me I would find un&s;ucce&s;sful."</P>
<P>The Marquis talked in high terms of the dignity of his hou&s;e, and how impo&s;&s;ible it was the Marchione&s;s &s;hould ever have di&s;graced it by &s;uch actions as I accu&s;ed her of committing. I an&s;wered him in a manner equally warm, that my accu&s;ations were too well grounded and &s;upported to dread refutation; that it was not only due to injured innocence, but e&s;&s;ential to my own honour,
<PB N="62" REF="038416_0462_1011E5418FB15580">
which would &s;oon be materially concerned in whatever related to Mi&s;s Fitzalan, to have tho&s;e accu&s;ations made public, if her Lady&s;hip refu&s;ed to contradict the a&s;per|&s;ions which might be thrown upon Mi&s;s Fitzalan, in con&s;equence of the &s;cene which pa&s;&s;ed at his Lord&s;hip's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>This the Marchione&s;s, with mingled rage and contempt, refu&s;ed doing, and Lady Euphra&s;ia, after the hint I gave of &s;oon being united to you, left the room in convul&s;ive agitation.</P>
<P>Lord Cherbury I perceived &s;u&s;pected &s;oul play, by &s;ome &s;peeches which dropped from him, &s;uch as, if there had been any mi&s;under&s;tanding between her La|dy&s;hip and Mi&s;s Fitzalan, it was better &s;urely to have it done away, or certainly, if any mi&s;take was proved relative to the affair which happened in her Lady&s;hip's hou&s;e, it was but ju&s;tice to the young Lady to have it cleared up.</P>
<P>Yet notwith&s;tanding the intere&s;t he felt in the cau&s;e of &s;uffering innocence, it was obvious to me that he dreaded a rupture with the Marquis's family, and appeared &s;hocked at the unequivocal declaration I had made of never being allied to it.</P>
<P>Lady Martha Dormer took up the cau&s;e: The te&s;|timony Lord Mortimer had received, &s;he &s;aid, of Mi&s;s Fitzalan's innocence was incontrovertible, and exempted him alike from being &s;tigmatized either as the dupe of art or love; humanity &s;he was convinced, exclu&s;ive of every warmer feeling, would have influenced him to have undertaken Mi&s;s Fitzalan's cau&s;e; it was the cau&s;e of innocence and virtue, a cau&s;e in which every dete&s;ter of &s;candal and treachery &s;hould join, &s;ince not only the defencele&s;s orphan, but the protected child of rank and pro&s;perity were vulnerable to their &s;hafts.</P>
<P>I again repeated the evidence of her &s;ervants, and the refutation of Mrs. Jennings to her former &s;tory; I produced, to &s;trengthen it, the unopened letters of Colonel Belgrave&mdash;thus continuing to put proof upon proof of your innocence (as Sancho Panza &s;ays) upon the &s;houlders of demon&s;tration.</P>

<P>As we expected, his Lord&s;hip &s;taid behind, with the hope I perceived of being able to calm the pertur|bations of the Marchione&s;s, and le&s;&s;en the breach be|tween us.

I have &s;o long dwelt upon di&s;agreeable &s;cenes, that to go over any others would be dreadful; nor &s;hould I hint to you that I had &s;uch &s;cenes to encounter, was it not to excu&s;e and account to you for my ab&s;ence from Ca&s;tle Car|berry: our difficulties (you &s;ee I already unite your in|tere&s;t with mine) began to decrea&s;e, and are at la&s;t hap|pily ovorcome.

The courier re|turned with a polite note from the officer's father, in|forming me his &s;on was gone on an excur&s;ion of plea|&s;ure with &s;ome friends, and that if he knew where to find him he would have tran&s;mitted my letter, which I might depend on being an&s;wered the moment he re|turned.</P>
<P>I have no doubt but we &s;hall receive intelligence from him concerning Mr. Fitzalan; it &s;hall then be our bu&s;ine&s;s, if his &s;ituation is not already plea&s;ing, to change it, or render it as much &s;o as po&s;&s;ible to him.</P>
<P>Keep up your &s;pirits therefore about him, for by the time we arrive in England I expect a letter from his friend, and let me not be any more pained by &s;ee|ing your countenance clouded with care or anxiety.</P>
<P>As a reward for reining in my impatience to &s;ee you this evening, be propitious to my reque&s;t for early admi&s;&s;ion to-morrow; if charitable you will allow me to breakfa&s;t with you, for I &s;hall take none except with you, and without an expre&s;s command to the con|trary, &s;hall take it for granted I am expected.</P>
<P>'Tis &s;aid that contra&s;t heightens plea&s;ure, and I believe the &s;aying. I believe that without having felt pain in all its accutene&s;s as I have done, I never &s;hould have felt &s;uch plea&s;ure as I now enjoy. After &s;o often giving you up, &s;o often lamenting you as lo&s;t foever, to think I &s;hall &s;oon call you mine, is a &s;ource of tran&s;port which words cannot expre&s;s. Mine, I may &s;ay, is the re&s;urrection of happine&s;s, for has it not been revived from the very grave of de&s;pair; but I forget that you have Lady Martha Dormer's letter &s;till to peru&s;e.

would give mine the preference; but in all rea&s;on it is time I &s;hould re&s;ign my place to her Lady&s;hip: But ere I bid you adieu, I mu&s;t tell you that Araminta is a &s;in|cere participator in our happine&s;s; &s;he arrived from Wales but a few minutes previous to my leaving Lon|don, and I would not allow her time, as &s;he wi&s;hed, to write to you. I almo&s;t forgot to tell you, that the Marquis's family, among&s;t whom Lady Grey&s;tock is &s;till numbered, in&s;tead of returning to town, &s;et out for Brighthelm&s;tone: I have learned, contrary to my and their expectations, that neither the hou&s;e keeper nor Mrs. Jane have been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, but both &s;ent to a di&s;tant &s;eat of the Marquis's. As we know the Mar|chione&s;s's revengeful di&s;po&s;ition, it is plain &s;he has &s;ome &s;ecret motive for not gratifying it immediately by their di&s;mi&s;&s;ion; but what it is can be of little con&s;equence for us to learn, &s;ince we are both too well guarded to &s;uffer from any future plot of her's; like every other which was formed again&s;t my dear Amanda, I tru&s;t they will ever prove abortive. I was di&s;turbed within a few miles of Ca&s;tle Carberry by a gentleman pa&s;&s;ing on hor&s;eback, who either &s;trongly re&s;embled, or was Colonel Belgrave. My blood boiled in my veins at his &s;ight; I left the carriage, mounted one of my &s;er|vant's hor&s;es, and endeavoured to overtake him. He certainly avoided me by taking &s;ome cro&s;s-road, as his &s;peed could not have out-&s;tripped mine; my efforts to di&s;cover his habitation were equally un&s;ucce&s;sful. As to your per&s;onal &s;ecurity I had no apprehen&s;ions, having heard con&s;tantly from my good friend the doc|tor about you; but I dreaded the wretch, if it were really him, might di&s;turb your tranquillity, either by forcing into your pre&s;ence or writing; thank Heaven from all intru&s;ions or dangers of this kind, my Amanda will now be guarded; but again am I tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing on the time you &s;hould devote to Lady Martha's letter. Adieu, and do not di&s;appoint my hopes of being allowed to vi&s;it you early.</P>

Amanda peru&s;ed this letter with emotions which can be better conceived than de&s;cribed. She could &s;carcely have parted with it without a &s;econd reading, had not Lady Martha's demanded her attention; &s;he &s;natched it ha&s;tly from the ground where it hitherto lay neglected, and read to the following purpo&s;e:</P>
<LETTER>
<P>That I warmly and &s;incerely congratulate my dear and amiable Mi&s;s Fitzalan on the happy revolution in her affairs &s;he will readily believe, per&s;uaded as &s;he mu&s;t be of the deep intere&s;t I take in whatever concerns a per&s;on on whom the happine&s;s of him, whom I have loved from childhood, &s;o materially, &s;o entirely I may &s;ay depends.</P>
<P>Yet do not &s;uppo&s;e me, my dear Mi&s;s Fitzalan, &s;o &s;elfi&s;h, as not to be able to rejoice at your happine&s;s on your own account, exclu&s;ive of every con&s;ideration re|lative to Lord Mortimer; long &s;ince I was taught by de&s;cription to e&s;teem and admire you, and even when the hope of being connected with you became extinct, I could not &s;o totally forego that admiration as to feel unintere&s;ted about you. Oh! how truly do I rejoice at the revival of the hope I have ju&s;t mentioned, and at its revival with every pro&s;pect of its being &s;peedily realized. I &s;hall con&s;ider Lord Mortimer as one of the mo&s;t fortunate of men in calling you his, and to think I have been able to promote his happine&s;s gives me a &s;atisfaction, which never was, nor ever will be equalled by any circum&s;tance in my life.</P>
<P>Though I cannot give my adopted daughter a for|tune by any means equal to that which Lady Euphra&s;ia Southerland will po&s;&s;e&s;s, Lord Cherbury is fully &s;en&s;ible that her perfections will abundantly make up for any de|&s;iciency in this re&s;pect. Ten thou&s;and pounds, and one thou&s;and a year, is at pre&s;ent to be her portion, and the rever&s;ion of the remainder of my fortune is to be &s;ecur|ed to her and Lord Mortimer; the final adju&s;tment of all affairs is to take place at my hou&s;e in the country, whither, I propo&s;e going immediately, accompanied by Lady Araminta, and where we &s;hall both mo&s;t impa|tiently expect your arrival, which we mutually entreat

</LETTER>
<P>Amanda's happine&s;s was now almo&s;t as great as it could be in this world, almo&s;t I &s;ay, for it received al|loy, from the melancholy con&s;ideration that her father, that faithful and affectionate friend who had &s;hared her troubles, could not be a partaker of her joys; but the &s;igh of unavailing regret which ro&s;e in her mind &s;he checked, by reflecting, that happine&s;s all perfect was more than humanity could either &s;upport or expect, and with pious gratitude &s;he bent to the power who had changed the di&s;coloured pro&s;pect, by which &s;he had been &s;o long &s;urrounded, into one of cheerfulne&s;s and beau|ty.</P>
<P>If her pride was wounded by the hint, though &s;o deli|cately conveyed, which Lord Mortimer had given of the difficulties he encountered in gaining Lord Cherbury's approbation, it was in&s;tantly relieved by the flattering commendations of lady Martha Dormer, and to be con|nected

with her and Lady Araminta, &s;he looked upon among&s;t the mo&s;t valuable ble&s;&s;ings &s;he could enjoy.</P>
<P>To expre&s;s what &s;he felt for Lord Mortimer would be impo&s;&s;ible; language could not do ju&s;tice to her feel|ings; &s;he felt love gratitude and admiration for him all in the fulle&s;t extent, and all united, and &s;he wept in the fulne&s;s of her heart over the joyful a&s;&s;urance of being his. With the two letters in her hand &s;he repaired to the Priore&s;s's apartment, whom &s;he found alone. The good old lady &s;aw the traces of tears on Amanda's face and exclaimed, in a voice which evinced her &s;ympathy in her concerns, "Oh! I fear, my child, &s;omething has happened to di&s;turb you!" Amanda pre&s;ented her the letters, and bid her judge from them whether &s;he had not rea&s;on to be agitated. As the Priore&s;s read, her &s;udden and broken exclamations manife&s;ted her &s;urpri&s;e and plea&s;ure, and frequently were her &s;pectacles removed to wipe from off them the tears of joy by which they were bedewed. When &s;he fini&s;hed the welcome pac|quet, &s;he turned to Amanda, who had been attentively watching the various turns in her countenance, and gave her a congratulatory embrace. "Lord Mortimer is worthy of you, my child," &s;aid the Priore&s;s, "and that is the highe&s;t eulogium I can pa&s;s on him." After commenting upon different parts of the letter, &s;he a&s;k|ed Amanda, a little archly, "whether &s;he intended &s;end|ing an expre&s;s command to his Lord&s;hip agin&s;t coming early in the morning?" Amanda hone&s;tly confe&s;&s;ed &s;he had no &s;uch intention, and expre&s;&s;ed her wi&s;h to behold him. The Priore&s;s &s;aid &s;he would have breakfa&s;t prepa|red for them in the garden parlour, and that &s;he would take care they &s;hould not be interrupted. She al&s;o pro|mi&s;ed to keep every thing &s;ecret till matters were ar|ranged for Amanda's removal from St. Catherine's.</P>

<P>JOY is as great an enemy to repo&s;e as anxi|ety. Amanda pa&s;&s;ed an almo&s;t &s;leeple&s;s night, but her thoughts were too agreeably employed to allow her to &s;uffer for want of re&s;t; early as &s;he aro&s;e in the morn|ing, &s;he was but a &s;hort time in the parlour before Lord Mortimer arrived. He appeared with all the tran&s;ports of his &s;oul beaming from his eyes, and was received by Amanda with tender and trembling emotion. He caught her to his heart as a trea&s;ure re&s;tored to him by the immediate hand of Heaven. He pre&s;&s;ed her to it with &s;ilent ec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">acy. Both for a few moments were unable to &s;peak; but the tears which bur&s;t from Amanda, and tho&s;e that &s;topped on the glowing cheeks of Lord Mor|timer, expre&s;&s;ed their feelings more forcibly than any language could have done.</P>
<P>Amanda at length found utterance, and began to thank his Lord&s;hip for all the difficulties he had gone through in vindicating her fame. He ha&s;tily &s;topped tho&s;e effu&s;ions of gratitude, by bidding her a&s;k her heart whether he had not been &s;erving him&s;elf as well as her by what he had done.</P>
<P>From the &s;oft confu&s;ion into which his tran&s;ports threw her, Amanda endeavoured to recover her&s;elf by repairing to the breakfa&s;t table, on which the good &s;i&s;|ters had &s;pread all the niceties (adapted for a morning repa&s;t) which the Convent could produce; but her hand was un&s;teady, &s;he &s;pilt the tea in pouring it out, and committed twenty blunders in helping Lord Mortimer.
<PB N="70" REF="038416_0470_1011E557B1D9A860">
He laughed a little archly at her embarra&s;&s;ment, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> in&s;i&s;ted on doing the honours of the table him&s;elf, to which Amanda, with a deep blu&s;h con&s;ented; but breakfa&s;t was little attended to. Amanda's hand was detained in Lord Mortimer's, while his eyes were con|tinually turning towards her, as if to a&s;&s;ure his heart that, in the lovely evidence of his happine&s;s there was no deception; and the tenderne&s;s Amanda had no longer rea&s;on to re&s;train, beamed from her looks, which al&s;o evinced her perfect &s;en&s;ibility of her pre&s;ent felicity&mdash;a felicity heightened by her approving con&s;cience te&s;tify|ing &s;he had merited it. The pure, the delightful &s;atis|faction re&s;ulting from this reflection gave &s;uch radiance to her complexion, that Lord Mortimer repeatedly de|clared her re&s;idence at St. Catherine's had made her more beautiful than ever. Twelve o'clock &s;truck, and found them &s;till loitering over the breakfa&s;t table. "The Nuns will think we have made a tolerable fea&s;t," cried Lord Mortimer, &s;miling, while Amanda aro&s;e with pre|cipitation. "I need not," continued he, following her, "like Sterne, a&s;k nature what has made the meal &s;o de|licious: I need only a&s;k my own heart and it will in|form me love and tenderne&s;s."&mdash;Amanda blu&s;hed, and they went together into the garden. She would have walked before the windows of the Convent, but Lord Mortimer forced her gently into a dark, &s;eque&s;tered a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ley: Here their conver&s;ation became more connect|ed than it had hitherto been; the generous intentions of Lady Martha Dormer, and the arrangements &s;he had made for the reception and nuptials of Amanda, were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">alked over, the marriage was to take place at Thornbu|ry, Lady Martha's &s;eat; they were to continue there for a month after its &s;olemnization, and from thence to go to an e&s;tate of Lord Cherbury's for the remainder of the &s;ummer; a hou&s;e in one of the &s;quares was to be taken and prepared for their re&s;idence in winter, and Lady Martha Dormer bad promi&s;ed, whenever &s;he came to town, which was but &s;eldom, &s;he would make their hou&s;e her home, provided they would promi&s;e to &s;pend every Chri&s;tmas, and three months at lea&s;t in &s;umm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">,

with her at Thornbury; Lord Mortimer &s;aid he had his choice of any of the Earl's &s;eats, but cho&s;e none, from an idea of the hall being more agreeable to Amanda. She a&s;&s;ured him it was, and he proceeded to mention the pre&s;ents which Lady Martha had prepared for her; al&s;o the carriages and retinue he had provided, and expected to find at Thornbury again&s;t &s;he reached it, &s;till a&s;king if the arrangements he had made met her approbation.</P>
<P>Amanda was affected even to tears, by the &s;olicitude he &s;hewed to plea&s;e her, and he perceiving her emoti|ons, changed the di&s;cour&s;e to talk about her removal from St. Catherine's, he entreated her not to delay it longer than was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to adju&s;t matters for it. She promi&s;ed compliance to this entreaty, ac|knowleging that &s;he but obeyed her inclination<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> in doing &s;o, as &s;he longed to be pre&s;ented to her generous patrone&s;s, Lady Martha, and to her amiable and be|loved Lady Araminta.</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer, delicately con&s;iderate about all which concerned her, begged &s;he would &s;peak to the priore&s;s to procure a decent female, who &s;hould be a proper attendant for her journey; they &s;hould travel to|gether in one chai&s;e, and he would follow them in ano|ther. Amanda promi&s;ed &s;he would lo&s;e no time in making this reque&s;t, which, &s;he had no doubt, would be &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer pre&s;ented her with a very beautiful embroidered pur&s;e, containing notes to the amount of five hundred pounds. Amanda blu&s;hed deeply&punc; and felt her feelings a little hurt at the idea of being obliged to Lord Mortimer for every thing. He pre&s;&s;ed her hand, and, in a voice of &s;oothing tenderne&s;s, told her he &s;hould be offended if &s;he did not from this moment con&s;ider her intere&s;t in&s;eparable from his. The notes, he &s;aid, of right belonged to her, as they amounted to but the individual &s;um he had already devoted to her u&s;e. He reque&s;ted &s;he would not curb in the lea&s;t her gene|rous &s;pirit, but fulfil in the utmo&s;t extent, all the claims which gratitude had upon her. The benevolent &s;i&s;ters of St. Catherine's were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he foremo&s;t in the li&s;t of tho&s;e
<PB N="72" REF="038416_0472_1011E55BFB5214B8">
who had conferred obligations upon her, and he de&s;ired &s;he would not only reward them liberally at pre&s;ent, but promi&s;e them an annual &s;tipend of fifty pounds.</P>
<P>Amanda was truly delighted at this, to be able to contribute to the comfort of tho&s;e who had &s;o largely promoted her's, was a &s;ource of exqui&s;ite felicity. Lord Mortimer pre&s;ented her with his picture, which he had drawn in London for that purpo&s;e; it was a &s;triking likene&s;s and mo&s;t elegantly &s;et with brilliants, which formed a cypher upon a plait of hair at the back. This was indeed a precious pre&s;ent to Amanda, and &s;he ac|knowledged it was &s;uch. Lord Mortimer &s;aid, that in return for it, he &s;hould expect her's at &s;ome future time; but added, &s;miling, "I &s;hall not heed the &s;ha|dow till I procure the &s;ub&s;tance." He al&s;o gave her a very beautiful ring, with an emblematical device, and adorned in the &s;ame manner as his picture, which lady Martha had &s;ent as a pledge of future friend&s;hip; and he now informed her, that her Lady&s;hip, accompanied by Lady Araminta, intended meeting them at Holy|head, that all due honour and attention might be paid to her adopted daughter.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of their conver&s;ation the dinner bell rang from the Convent. Amanda &s;tarted, and declared &s;he had not &s;uppo&s;ed it half &s;o late.&mdash;The arch &s;mile, which this &s;peech occa&s;ioned in Lord Mortimer, in&s;tant|ly made her perceive it had been a tacit confe&s;&s;ion of the plea&s;ure &s;he enjoyed in their tete-a-tete.</P>
<P>She blu&s;hed, and telling him &s;he could not &s;tay ano|ther moment, was hurrying away. He ha&s;tily caught her, and holding both her hands, declared &s;he &s;hould not depart, neither would he to his &s;olitary dinner, till &s;he promi&s;ed he might return to her early in the eve|ning. To this &s;he con&s;ented, provided he allowed her to have the Priore&s;s and &s;i&s;ter Mary at lea&s;t at tea. This was a condition Lord Mortimer by no means liked to agree to, and he endeavoured to prevail on her to drop it; but finding her inflexible, he &s;aid &s;he was a provok|ing girl, and a&s;ked her if &s;he was not afraid that, when he had the power, he would retaliate upon her for all
<PB N="73" REF="038416_0473_1011E55D97EB0FE8">
the trials &s;he had put his patience to; but &s;ince &s;he would have it &s;o, why it mu&s;t be &s;o to be &s;ure, he &s;aid; but he hoped the good ladies would have too much con|&s;cience to &s;it out the whole evening with them. That was all chance, Amanda &s;aid. The bell again rang, and he was forced to depart.</P>
<P>She took the opportunity of being alone with the Priore&s;s for a few minutes, to &s;peak to her about procur|ing a female to attend her in her journey. The Priore&s;s &s;aid, &s;he doubted not but &s;he could procure her an eli|gible per&s;on from the neighbouring town, and promi&s;ed to write there that very evening, to a family who would be able to a&s;&s;i&s;t her enquiries.</P>
<P>Both &s;he and &s;i&s;ter Mary were much plea&s;ed by being invited to drink tea with Lord Mortimer. He came even earlier than was expected. Poor Amanda was ter|rified, lea&s;t her companions &s;hould over-hear him re|peatedly a&s;king her whether they would not retire im|mediately after tea? Though not over-heard, the Pri|ore&s;s had too much &s;agacity not to know her departure was de&s;ired; &s;he therefore, under pretence of bu&s;ine&s;s, retired and took Mary along with her. Amanda and Lord Mortimer went into the garden. He thanked her for not lo&s;ing time in &s;peaking to the priore&s;s about her &s;ervant, and &s;aid, that he hoped, at the end of the week, at farthe&s;t, &s;he would be able to begin her journey. Amanda readily promi&s;ed to u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch They pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome delightful hours in rambling about the garden, and talking over their felicity.</P>
<P>The Priore&s;s's expectation was an&s;wered relative to a &s;ervant; in the cour&s;e of two days &s;he produced one in every re&s;pect agreeable to Amanda, and things were now in &s;uch forwardne&s;s for her departure, that &s;he expected it would take place as &s;oon as Lord Mortimer had mentioned. His time was pa&s;&s;ed almo&s;t continually at St. Catherine's, never leaving it except at dinner-time, when he went to Ca&s;tle Carberry: His re&s;idence there was &s;oon known, and vi&s;itors and invitations without number came to the Ca&s;tle, but he found means of avoid|ing them.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="038416_0474_1011E5614454DB30">
Amanda laughing, would often tell him he retarded the preparations for her journey by being always with her&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, he &s;aid, was only a pretext to drive him away, for that he rather forwarded them by letting her lo&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> time.</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer, on coming to Amanda one evening as u&s;ual, appeared uncommonly di&s;compo&s;ed, his face was flu&s;hed, and his whole manner betrayed agitation. He &s;carcely noticed Amanda; but &s;eating him&s;elf, pla|ced his arm upon a table, and leaned his head deject|edly upon it. Amanda was inexpre&s;&s;ibly &s;hocked, her heart panted with apprehen&s;ion of ill, but &s;he felt too timid to make an enquiry. He &s;uddenly knit his brows, and muttered between his teeth, "cur&s;e on the wretch."</P>
<P>Amanda could no longer keep &s;ilence: "What wretch?" &s;he exclaimed, "or what is the meaning of this di&s;order?</P>
<P>"Fir&s;t tell me, Amanda," &s;aid he looking very &s;tedfa&s;tly at her, "have you &s;een any &s;tranger here lately?"</P>
<P>"Good heavens!" replied &s;he "what can you mean by &s;uch a que&s;tion? but I &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ure you I have not."</P>
<P>"Enough," &s;aid he, "&s;uch an a&s;&s;urance re&s;tores me to quiet; but, my dear Amanda," coming over to her, and taking her hands in his, "&s;ince you have perceived my agitation, I mu&s;t account to you for it. I have ju&s;t &s;een Belgrave; he was but a few yards from me on the common when I &s;aw him; but the mean de&s;|picable wretch, loaded as he is with con&s;cious guilt, dur&s;t not face me; he got out of my way by leaping over the hedge, which divides the common from a lane with many intricate windings: I endeavoured, but without &s;ucce&s;s, to di&s;cover the one he had retreated through."</P>
<P>"I &s;ee," &s;aid Amanda, pale and trembling, "he is de&s;tined to make me wretched. I had hoped indeed that Lord Mortimer would no more have &s;uffered his quiet to be interrupted by him; it implies &s;uch a doubt," &s;aid &s;he, weeping, "as &s;hocks my &s;oul! If <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> continually to be revived, we had better <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> at

once, for mi&s;ery mu&s;t be the con&s;equence of an union without mutual confidence.</P>
<P>"Gracious Heaven!" &s;aid Lord Mortimer, "how unfortunate I am to give you pain! You mi&s;take entire|ly, indeed, my deare&s;t Amanda, the cau&s;e of my unea|&s;ine&s;s; I &s;wear by all that is &s;acred, no doubt, no &s;u&s;|picion of your worth has ari&s;en in my mind. No man can think more highly of a woman than I do of you; but I was di&s;turbed le&s;t the wretch &s;hould have forced him&s;elf into your pre&s;ence, and le&s;t you, through ap|prehen&s;ions for me, concealed it from me."</P>
<P>The explanation calmed the perturbation of Amanda; as an atonement for the unea&s;ine&s;s he had given her, &s;he wanted Lord Mortimer to promi&s;e he would not endea|vour to di&s;cover Belgrave. This promi&s;e he avoided giving, and Amanda was afraid of pre&s;&s;ing it, le&s;t the &s;park of jealou&s;y, which &s;he was convinced exi&s;ted in the di&s;po&s;ition of Lord Mortimer, &s;hould be blown into a flame; that Belgrave would &s;tudiou&s;ly avoid him &s;he tru&s;ted, and &s;he re&s;olved, that if the things that &s;he had deemed it nece&s;&s;ary to order from the neighbouring town, were not fini&s;hed, to wait no longer for them, as &s;he longed now more than ever to quit a place &s;he thought dangerous to Lord Mortimer. The en&s;uing morning, in&s;tead of &s;eeing his Lord&s;hip at breakfa&s;t, a note was brought to her, couched in the&s;e words:</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO MISS FITZALAN.</HEAD>
<P>I am unavoidably prevented from waiting on my dear Amanda this morning, but in the cour&s;e of the day &s;he may depend on either &s;eeing or hearing from me again. She can have no excu&s;e now on my account about not ha&s;tening the preparations for her journey, and when we meet, if I find her time has not been em|ployed to this purpo&s;e, &s;he m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y expect a &s;evere ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ding from her faithful</P>

</LETTER>
<P>This note filled Amanda with the mo&s;t alarming di&s;|quiet; it was evident to her that he was gone in pur&s;uit
<PB N="76" REF="038416_0476_1011E5669918F510">
of Belgrave. She ran into the hall to enquire of the me&s;|&s;enger about his ma&s;ter, but he was gone. She then ha&s;tened to the Priore&s;s, and communicated her appre|hen&s;ions to her. The Priore&s;s endeavoured to calm them, by a&s;&s;uring her &s;he might be convinced that Belgrave had taken too many precautions to be di&s;co|vered.</P>
<P>Amanda's breakfa&s;t, however, remained untouched, and her things unpacked, and &s;he continued the whole morning the picture of anxiety, impatiently expecting the promi&s;ed vi&s;it or letter; neither came and &s;he re|&s;olved to &s;end, after dinner, the old gardner to Ca&s;tle Carberry to enquire after Lord Mortimer. While &s;he was &s;peaking to him for that purpo&s;e, the maid followed her into the garden, and told her there was a me&s;&s;enger in the parlour from Lord Mortimer. She flew thither, but what words can expre&s;s her &s;urpri&s;e, when the &s;up|po&s;ed me&s;&s;enger rai&s;ing a large hat which &s;hadowed his face, and removing a handkerchief which he had hi|therto held up to it, di&s;covered to her view the features of Lord Cherbury. She could only exclaim, "Gracious Heaven has any thing happened to Lord Mortimer?" ere &s;he &s;unk into a chair in breathle&s;s agitation.</P>

<P>LORD Cherbury ha&s;tened to &s;upport and calm her agitation, by a&s;&s;uring her Lord Mortimer was in perfect &s;afety. Recovering a little by this a&s;&s;ertion, &s;he a&s;ked him how he was a&s;&s;ured of this. He an&s;wer|ed, becau&s;e he had &s;een him, though without being per|ceived

by him, about an hour ago. Amanda, re&s;tored to her faculties, by being a&s;&s;ured he was uninjured, be|gan to reflect on the &s;uddenne&s;s of Lord Cherbury's vi|&s;it. She would have flattered her&s;elf he came to intro|duce her to his family him&s;elf had not his looks almo&s;t forbid &s;uch an idea; they were gloomy and di&s;ordered, his eyes were fa&s;tened on her, yet he appeared unwil|ling to &s;peak.</P>
<P>Amanda felt her&s;elf in too aukward and embarra&s;&s;ing a &s;ituation to break the unplea&s;ant &s;ilence. At la&s;t Lord Cherbury &s;uddenly exclaimed: "Lord Mortimer does not, nor mu&s;t not, know of my being here."</P>
<P>"Mu&s;t not!" repeated Amanda, in inconceivable a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>"Gracious Heaven!" &s;aid Lord Cherbury, &s;tarting from the chair on which he had thrown him&s;elf, oppo&s;ite to her, "how &s;hall I begin, how &s;hall I tell her? Oh! Mi&s;s Fitzalan," he continued, approaching her, "I have much to &s;ay, and you have much to hear, which will &s;hock you, I believed I could better in an interview have informed you of particulars, but I find I was mis|taken. I will write to you."</P>
<P>"My Lord," cried Amanda, ri&s;ing, all pale and trembling, "tell me now, to leave me in &s;u&s;pence, after receiving &s;uch dreadful hints, would be cruelty. Oh! &s;urely, if Lord Mortimer be &s;afe&mdash;if Lady Martha Dormer&mdash;if Lady Araminta is well&mdash;I can have no|thing &s;o very &s;hocking to hear."</P>
<P>"Alas!" replied he, mournfully &s;haking his head, "you are mi&s;taken; be &s;atisfied, however, that the friends you have mentioned are all well. I have &s;aid I would write to you. Can you meet me this evening among&s;t the ruins?" Amanda gave an a&s;&s;enting bow. "I &s;hall then," pur&s;ued he, "have a letter ready to de|liver you. In the mean time I mu&s;t inform you, no per|&s;on in the world knows of my vi&s;it here but your&s;elf, and of all beings, Lord Mortimer is the la&s;t I &s;hould wi&s;h to know it. Remember, then, Mi&s;s Fitzalan," ta|king her hand, which he gra&s;ped with violence, as if to
<PB N="78" REF="038416_0478_1011E56CC8040468">
impre&s;s his words upon her heart, "remember, that on your &s;ecre&s;y every thing mo&s;t e&s;timable in life, even life it&s;elf perhaps depends."</P>
<P>With the&s;e dreadful and my&s;terious words he depart|ed, leaving Amanda a picture of horror and &s;urprize; it was many minutes ere &s;he moved from the attitude in which he laft her, and when &s;he did, it was only to walk in a di&s;ordered manner about the room repeating his dreadful words. He was come perhaps to part her and Lord Mortimer, and yet, after con&s;enting to their uni|on, &s;urely Lord Cherbury could not be guilty of &s;uch treachery and deceit; yet, this was not the ca&s;e, why conceal his coming to Ireland from Lord Mortimer? Why let it be known only to her? And what could be the &s;ecrets of dreadful import he had to communi|cate?</P>
<P>From the&s;e &s;elf-interrogations, in which her rea&s;on was almo&s;t bewildered, the entrance of the Priore&s;s drew her.</P>
<P>She &s;tarted at &s;eeing the pale and di&s;tracted looks of Amanda, and a&s;ked, "if &s;he had heard any bad tidings of Lord Mortimer?"</P>
<P>Amanda &s;ighed heavily at this que&s;tion, and &s;aid, "No." The &s;ecre&s;y &s;he had been ejoined &s;he dur&s;t not violate, by mentioning the my&s;terious vi&s;it to her friend; unable, however to conver&s;e on any other &s;ub|ject, &s;he re&s;olved to retire to her chamber. She placed her illne&s;s and agitation to the account of Lord Morti|mer, and &s;aid a little re&s;t was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for her, and begged, if his Lord&s;hip came in the cour&s;e of the evening, he might be told &s;he was too ill to &s;ee him.</P>
<P>The Priore&s;s pre&s;&s;ed her to &s;tay for tea. She refu&s;ed, and as &s;he retired from the room, de&s;ired nothing might be &s;aid of the per&s;on who had ju&s;t &s;een her, to Lord Mortimer; &s;aying, with a faint &s;mile, "&s;he would not make him vain by letting him know of her anxiety about him." She retired to her chamber, and endeavoured to controul her perturbations, that &s;he might be the better
<PB N="79" REF="038416_0479_1011E56E57DFF428">
enabled to &s;upport what &s;he had &s;o much rea&s;on to ap|prehend. Neither the Priore&s;s nor the nuns, in obedi|ence to her injunctions intruded upon her, and at the appointed hour &s;he &s;oftly opened the chamber door, and, every place being clear, &s;tole &s;oftly from the Convent.</P>
<P>She found Lord Cherbury waiting for her amid&s;t the &s;olitary ruins. He had a letter in his hand, which he pre&s;ented to her the moment &s;he appeared.</P>
<P>"In this letter, Mi&s;s Fitzalan, &s;aid he, "I have opened to you my whole heart: I have di&s;burthened it of &s;ecrets which have long oppre&s;&s;ed it; I have entru&s;ted my honour to your care. From what I have &s;aid, that its contents are of a &s;acred nature, you may believe, &s;hould they be con&s;idered in any other light by you, the con&s;equences may, nay mu&s;t be fatal." He &s;aid this with a &s;terne&s;s which made Amanda &s;hrink, "Med|itate well on the contents of that letter, Mi&s;s Fitzalan," continued he, with a voice of deep &s;olemnity, "for it is a letter which will fix your de&s;tiny and mine; even &s;hould the reque&s;t contained in it be refu&s;ed, let me be the fir&s;t acquainted with the refu&s;al;&mdash;then indeed I &s;hall urge you no more to &s;ecre&s;y, for what will follow in con&s;equence of &s;uch a refu&s;al, mu&s;t divulge all."</P>
<P>"Oh! tell me, tell me," &s;aid Amanda, catching hold of his arm, "tell me what is the reque&s;t, or what it is I am to fear: Oh! tell me all at once, and rid me of the torturing &s;u&s;pence I endure."</P>
<P>"I cannot," he cried, "indeed I cannot. To-mor|row night I &s;hall expect your an&s;wer here at the &s;ame hour."</P>
<P>At this moment Lord Mortimer's voice calling upon Amanda was heard. Lord Cherbury dropped her hand which he had taken, and in&s;tantly retired among&s;t the windings of the pile, from whence Lord Mortimer &s;oon appeared, giving Amanda only time to hide the fatal letter.</P>
<P>"Good Heaven!" exclaimed he, "what could have brought you hither, and who was the per&s;on who ju&s;t de|parted from you?" It was well for Amanda that the
<PB N="80" REF="038416_0480_1011E57130732708">
twilight gave but an imperfect view of her face; &s;he felt her colour come and go; a cold dew over&s;pread her forehead; &s;he leaned again&s;t a rude fragment of the building and faintly exclaimed, "the per&s;on&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Yes," &s;aid Lord Mortimer, "I am &s;ure I heard retreating foot&s;teps."</P>
<P>"You are mi&s;taken," re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eated Amanda in the &s;ame faint accent.</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid he, "though you may di&s;pute the evidence of my ears, you cannot the evidence of my eyes; I &s;ee you here, and am a&s;toni&s;hed at it."</P>
<P>"I came here for air," &s;aid Amanda.</P>
<P>"For air," repeated Lord Mortimer, "I own I &s;hould have thought the garden better adapted to &s;uch a pur|po&s;e; but why come hither in a clande&s;tine manner? Why, if you have the fears you would per&s;uade me you have, expo&s;e your&s;elf to danger from the wretch who haunts the place, by coming here alone? When I went to the convent I was told you were indi&s;po&s;ed, and could not be di&s;turbed: I could not depart, however, without making an effort to &s;ee you; but you can ea&s;ier imagine than I de&s;cribe, the con&s;ternation I felt when you could not be found; it was wrong, indeed, Amanda, it was wrong to come here alone, and affect concealment."</P>
<P>"Gracious Heaven!" &s;aid Amanda, rai&s;ing her hands and eyes, and bur&s;ting into tears, "how wretch|ed am I!"</P>
<P>She was indeed at this moment &s;uperlatively wretched; her heart was oppre&s;&s;ed by the dread of evil, and &s;he perceived &s;u&s;picions in Lord Mortimer which &s;he could not attempt to remove, lea&s;t an intimation of the &s;ecret &s;he was &s;o awfully enjoined to keep &s;hould e&s;cape.</P>
<P>"Ah! Amanda," &s;aid Lord Mortimer, lo&s;ing in a moment the a&s;perity with which he had addre&s;&s;ed her at fir&s;t, "ah! Amanda, like the re&s;t of your &s;ex, you know too well the power of your tears not to u&s;e them. For|get, or at lea&s;t forgive, all I have &s;aid. I was di&s;ap|pointed in not &s;eeing you the moment I expected, and that put me out of temper. I know I am too impetu|ous, but you will in time &s;ubdue every unruly pa&s;&s;ion; I
<PB N="81" REF="038416_0481_1011E574F011C170">
put my&s;elf into your hands, and you &s;hall make me what you plea&s;e."</P>
<P>He now pre&s;&s;ed her to his bo&s;om, and finding her tremble univer&s;ally, again implored her forgivene&s;s, as he imputed the agitation &s;he betrayed entirely to the unea&s;ine&s;s he had given her. She a&s;&s;ured him, with a faultering voice, he had not offended her. Her Spirits were affected, &s;he &s;aid, by all &s;he had &s;uffered during the day: Lord Mortimer placing, as &s;he wi&s;hed, tho&s;e &s;ufferings to his own account, declared her anxiety at once pained and plea&s;ed him, adding, he would truly confe&s;s what detained him from her during the day, as &s;oon as they returned to the Convent.</P>
<P>Their return to it relieved the &s;i&s;terhood, who had al&s;o been &s;eeking Amanda, from many apprehen&s;ions. The Priore&s;s and &s;i&s;ter Mary followed them into the parlour, where Lord Mortimer begged, "they would have compa&s;&s;ion on him, and give him &s;omething for his &s;upper, as he had &s;carcely eaten any thing the whole day."</P>
<P>Si&s;ter Mary in&s;tantly replied, "He &s;hould be gratifi|ed, as Amanda was in the &s;ame predicament, and &s;he hoped he would now be able to prevail on her to eat." The cloth was accordingly laid, and a few trifles placed upon it. Si&s;ter Mary would gladly have &s;taid, but the Priore&s;s had under&s;tanding enough to think the &s;upper would be more palatable if they were ab&s;ent, and ac|cordingly retired.</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer now, with the mo&s;t &s;oothing tender|ne&s;s, tried to cheer his fair companion, and make her take &s;ome refre&s;hment; but his efforts for either of tho&s;e purpo&s;es were un&s;ucce&s;sful, and &s;he be&s;ought him not to think her ob&s;tinate, if &s;he could not in a moment re|cover her &s;pirits; to divert his attention a little from her&s;elf &s;he a&s;ked him to perform his promi&s;e, by rela|ting what kept him the whole day from St. Catherine's.</P>
<P>He now acknowledged he had been in &s;earch of Bel|grave; but the precautions he had taken to conceal him|&s;elf baffled all enquiries; "which convinces me," con|tinued Lord Mortimer, "if I wanted conviction about
<PB N="82" REF="038416_0482_1011E5779B9D0BC8">
&s;uch a matter, that he has not yet dropped his villain|ous de&s;igns upon you: but the wretch cannot always e&s;cape the vengeance he merits."</P>
<P>"May he never," cried Amanda fervently, yet in|voluntarily, "meet it from your hands."</P>
<P>"We will drop that part of the &s;ubject," &s;aid Lord Mortimer, "if you plea&s;e. You mu&s;t know," conti|nued he, "after &s;couring the whole neighbourhood, I fell in about four miles hence with a gentleman, who had vi&s;ited at the Marquis of Ro&s;line's la&s;t &s;ummer: he immediately a&s;ked me to accompany him home to din|ner. From his re&s;idence in the country I thought it probable he might be able to give &s;ome account of Bel|grave, and therefore accepted the invitation, but my en|quiries were as fruitle&s;s here as el&s;ewhere. When I found it &s;o I was on thorns to depart, particularly as all the gentlemen were &s;et in for drinking, and feared I might be thrown into an improper &s;ituation to vi&s;it my Amanda; I was on the watch, however, and to u&s;e their &s;porting term, literally &s;tole away.</P>
<P>"Thank Heaven!" &s;aid Amanda, "your enquiries proved fruitle&s;s. Oh! never, never repeat them; think no more about a wretch &s;o de&s;picable."</P>
<P>"Well," cried Lord Mortimer, "why don't you hurry me from the neighbourhood; fix the day, the moment for our departure: I have been here already five days. Lady Martha's patience is, I dare &s;ay quite exhau&s;ted by this time, and &s;hould we delay much long|er, I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he will think we have both became con|verts to the holy rites of this convent, and that I, in|&s;tead of taking the vows, which &s;hould make me a joyful bridegroom, am about taking tho&s;e which &s;hall doom me to celibacy; &s;eriou&s;ly, what but want of inclination can longer detain you!"</P>
<P>"Ah!" &s;aid Amanda, "you know too well that my departure cannot be retarded by want of inclination."</P>
<P>"Then why not decide immediately upon the day?" Amanda was &s;ilent; her &s;ituation was agonizing; how could &s;he fix upon a day, uncertain whether &s;he did not
<PB N="83" REF="038416_0483_1011E57929B258D0">
po&s;&s;e&s;s a letter which would prevent her ever taking the projected journey?"</P>
<P>"Well," &s;aid Lord Mortimer, after allowing her &s;ome time to &s;peak, "I &s;ee I mu&s;t fix the day my&s;elf; this is Tue&s;day&mdash;let it be Thur&s;day."</P>
<P>"Let us drop the &s;ubject this night, my Lord," &s;aid Amanda, "I am really ill, and only wait for your departure to retire to re&s;t."</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer obeyed her, but with reluctance, and &s;oon after retired.</P>

<P>To de&s;troy a pro&s;pect of felicity, at the very mo|ment its enveloping glooms are di&s;per&s;ed, is indeed the &s;ource of pangs mo&s;t dreadful; yet &s;uch are the horrors of my de&s;tiny, that nothing but intervening between you, Mortimer and happine&s;s, can &s;ave me from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.

mankind, wretched in thinking he &s;hall interrupt not only your peace, but the peace of a &s;on, &s;o noble, &s;o gra|cious, &s;o idolized, as Mortimer is by him; but I will no longer torture your feelings by keeping you in &s;u&s;|pence; the preface I have already given is &s;ufficient, and I will be explicit: Gambling, that bane of fame and fortune, has been my ruin; but whil&s;t I indulged, &s;o well did I conceal my propen&s;ity for it, that even tho&s;e I called my friends are ignorant of it. With &s;hame I confe&s;s I was ever foremo&s;t to rail again&s;t this vice, which was continually drawing &s;ums in &s;ecret from me, that would have given comfort and affluence to many a child of want for &s;ome time; my good and bad fortune were &s;o equal, that my income &s;uffered no con&s;iderable di|minution. About five years ago a Mr. Freelove, a particular friend of mine died, and left to my care his only &s;on, who, I dare &s;ay, you may recollect having &s;een at my hou&s;e la&s;t winter: this young man's property was con&s;igned to my care to manage as much for his advantage as I could; it con&s;i&s;ted of a large e&s;tate, and fifty thou&s;and pounds. At the period Free|love became my ward, I had had a con&s;tant run of ill|luck for many months. The ardour of gaining (unlike every other pa&s;&s;ion) is rather increa&s;ed than dimini&s;hed by di&s;appointment: without being warned therefore by ill &s;ucce&s;s I &s;till went on, till all I could touch of my own property was gone. Did I then retire, a&s;hamed of my folly?&mdash;No&mdash;I could not bear to do &s;o, without an|other effort for recovering my lo&s;&s;es, and in that effort ri&s;ked &s;omething more precious than I had ever yet done&mdash;namely, my honour, by u&s;ing the money which lay in my hands belonging to Freelove, the long period, which was to elap&s;e ere he came of age, emboldened me to this. Ere that period I tru&s;ted I &s;hould have retrieved my lo&s;&s;es, and be enabled not only to di&s;charge the prin|cipal, but whatever intere&s;t it would have brought, if applied to another purpo&s;e. I followed the bent of my evil genius, &s;um after &s;um taken up, and all alike buried in the accur&s;ed vortex which had already &s;wallowed &s;o
<PB N="85" REF="038416_0485_1011E57F488D02B8">
much from me! But when I found all was gone, oh, Mi&s;s Fitzalan! I &s;till tremble at the di&s;traction of that moment.</P>
<P>All, as I have &s;aid before, that I could touch of property was gone, the remainder was &s;o &s;ettled, I had no power over it, except joined by my &s;on. Great as was the injury he would &s;u&s;tain by mortgaging it, I was confident he never would he&s;itate doing &s;o if acquainted with my di&s;tre&s;s; but to let him know it was wor&s;e than a death of torture could be to me, his early excel|lence, the noblene&s;s of his principles, mingled in the love I felt for him a degree of awe; to confe&s;s my&s;elf a villain to &s;uch a caracter, to acknowledge my life had been a &s;cene of deceit; to be aba&s;hed, confounded in the pre&s;ence of my &s;on, to meet his piercing eye, to &s;ee the blu&s;h of &s;hame mantle his cheeks for his father's crimes&mdash;oh horrible!&mdash;mo&s;t! horrible! I raved at the idea, and re&s;olved, if driven by nece&s;&s;ity, to tell him of my ba&s;ene&s;s, not to &s;urvive the confe&s;&s;ion. At this critical juncture the Marquis of Ro&s;line came from Scotland to re&s;ide in London; an intimacy which had been dormant for years between our families was then revived, and I &s;oon found that an alliance between them would be plea&s;ing. The pro&s;pect of it rai&s;ed me from the very depth of de&s;pair; but my tran&s;ports were of &s;hort continuance, for Mortimer not only &s;hewed, but expre&s;&s;ed the &s;tronge&s;t repugnance to &s;uch a connex|ion.</P>
<P>Time and daily experience I tru&s;ted would &s;o forci|bly convince him of the advantages of it, as at la&s;t to conquer this repugnance; nor did the hope of an alliance taking place entirely for&s;ake my heart, till informed he was already be&s;towed upon another object. My feelings at this information I &s;hall not attempt to de&s;cribe; all hope of &s;aving my&s;elf from di&s;honour was now cut off; for though dutiful and attentive to me in the highe&s;t de|gree, I could not flatter my&s;elf that Mortimer would bindly &s;acrifice his rea&s;on and inclination to my will. The mo&s;t fatal intentions again took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my

mind, but the uncertainties he &s;uffed on your account, kept me in horrible &s;u&s;pence as to their execution; after &s;ome months of torture I began again to revive, by learn|ing that you and Mortimer were inevitably &s;eparated, and &s;uch is the &s;elfi&s;h nature of vice, &s;o abandoned is it to all feelings of humanity, that I rather rejoiced at than lamented the &s;uppo&s;ed di&s;grace of the daughter of my friend.</P>
<P>But the per&s;evering con&s;tancy of Mortimer, rather let me &s;ay the immediate interpo&s;ition of Providence, &s;oon gave her rea&s;on to triumph over the arts of her ene|mies, and I was again reduced to de&s;pair. Mortimer, I dare &s;ay, from motives of delicacy, has concealed from you the oppo&s;ition I gave to his wi&s;hes after your inno|cence was cleared, and the intentions of Lady Martha Dormer relative to you were made known; at la&s;t I found I mu&s;t either &s;eem to acquie&s;ce in the&s;e wi&s;hes and intentions, or divulge my real motive for oppo&s;ing them, or el&s;e quarrel with my &s;on and &s;i&s;ter, and appear in their eyes the mo&s;t &s;elfi&s;h of human beings: I there|fore, to appearance, acquie&s;ced, but re&s;olved in reality to throw my&s;elf upon your mercy, believing that a cha|racter &s;o tender, &s;o perfect, &s;o heroic like, as your's has been through every &s;cene of di&s;tre&s;s, would have com|pa&s;&s;ion on a fallen fellow creature. Was my &s;ituation otherwi&s;e than it now is, were you even portionle&s;s, I &s;hould rejoice at having you united to my family from your own intrin&s;ic merit. Situated as I am, the fortune Lady Martha Dormer propo&s;es giving you can be of no con&s;equence to me; the projected match between you and Mortimer is yet a &s;ecret from the public, of cour&s;e it has not le&s;&s;ened his intere&s;t with the Ro&s;line family. I have already been &s;o fortunate as to adju&s;t the unlucky difference which took place between them, and remove any re&s;entment they entertained again&s;t him, and I am confident the fir&s;t overture he &s;hould make for an union with Lady Euphra&s;ia would be &s;ucce&s;sful; the fortune which would immediately be received with her is &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds, and five thou&s;and a year; the fir&s;t would be given up to me in place of the &s;ettlement I

<P>I &s;tand upon the verge of a dreadful aby&s;s, and it is in your power only to pre&s;erve me from plunging into it: you, who like an angel of mercy, may bid me live, and &s;ave me from de&s;truction: yet think not in re&s;igning Lord Mortimer, if indeed &s;uch a re&s;ignation &s;hould take place, you &s;acrifice your own intere&s;t&mdash;No&mdash;it &s;hall be my grateful care to &s;ecure to you independence, and I am confident, among the many men you mu&s;t meet &s;en|&s;ible of your worth, and enraptured with your charms, you may yet &s;elect one as calculated to render you happy as Mortimer, while he, di&s;appointed of the object of his affections, will, I have no doubt, without longer he&s;ita|tion, accept the one I &s;hall again propo&s;e to him.</P>
<P>But &s;hould you determine on giving him up, you a&s;k how, and by what means, you can break with him after what has pa&s;&s;ed, without revealing your real motive for doing &s;o to him.</P>
<P>That is indeed a difficulty; but after going &s;o far, I mu&s;t not he&s;itate in telling you how it can be removed.

<P>The fatal letter fell from Amanda, a mi&s;t over&s;pread her eyes, and &s;he &s;unk &s;en&s;ele&s;s on her chair; but the privation of her mi&s;ery was of &s;hort duration, and &s;he recovered as if from a dreadful dream; &s;he felt cold, trembling, and terrified; &s;he looked round the room with an eye of apprehen&s;ion and di&s;may, bewildered as to the cau&s;e of her wretchedne&s;s and terror, till the let|ter at her feet again &s;truck her &s;ight.</P>
<P>"Was there no way," &s;he a&s;ked her&s;elf, as &s;he again examined the contents, "was there no way by which the dreadful &s;acrifice it doomed her to could be avoided Lady Martha and Lord Mortimer would unite their ef|forts to &s;ave the honour of their wretched relative; they would &s;ooth his feelings&mdash;they would compa&s;&s;ionate his failings&mdash;they would&mdash;" but &s;he &s;tarted in the mid&s;t of the&s;e ideas; &s;tarted as from ideas fraught with guilt and horror, as tho&s;e fatal words ru&s;hed upon her mind&mdash;"I will not &s;urvive the divulgement of my &s;ecret"&mdash;and &s;he found that to &s;ave the father &s;he mu&s;t re&s;ign the &s;on.</P>
<P>How unworthy of &s;uch a &s;acrifice, engaged as &s;he was to Lord Mortimer! &s;he began to doubt whether &s;he had a right to make it. What a doubt! She &s;huddered for having conceived it, and reproached her&s;elf for yielding a moment to the &s;ugge&s;tions of tenderne&s;s which had giv|en

ri&s;e to it. She re&s;olved, without a farther &s;truggle, to &s;ubmit to rea&s;on and to virtue, convinced that, if ac|ce&s;&s;ary to Lord Cherbury's death, nothing could a&s;&s;uage her wretchedne&s;s, and the unhappine&s;s Lord Mortimer would &s;uffer at lo&s;ing her would be trifling, compared to that he would feel if he lo&s;t his father by an act of &s;uicide.</P>
<P>"In my fate," exclaimed &s;he, in a low and broken accent of de&s;pair, "there is no alternative! I &s;ubmit to it without a farther &s;truggle. I dare not call upon one being to advi&s;e me: I re&s;ign him therefore," &s;he con|tinued, as if Lord Cherbury was really pre&s;ent to hear her re&s;ignation; "re&s;ign Lord Mortimer; but oh, my God!" rai&s;ing her hands with agony to heaven, "give me fortitude to bear the horrors of my &s;ituation. Oh, Mortimer! dear, invaluable Mortimer! the hand of fate is again&s;t our union, and we mu&s;t part, never, never more to meet! From the imputation of ingratitude and guilt I &s;hall not be allowed to vindicate my&s;elf: No, I am completely the victim of Lord Cherbury&mdash;the cruel perfidious Cherbury, who&s;e treachery, who&s;e &s;eeming acquie&s;cence in the wi&s;hes of his &s;on has given me joy but to render my mi&s;ery more acute!"</P>
<P>That Lord Mortimer would impute withdrawing her|&s;elf from him to an attachment for Belgrave &s;he was convinced, and that her fame, as well as peace, &s;hould be &s;acrificed to Lord Cherbury, cau&s;ed &s;uch a whirl of contending pa&s;&s;ions in her mind, that rea&s;on and reflec|tion for a few minutes yielded to their violence, and &s;he re&s;olved to vindicate her&s;elf to Lord Mortimer. This re&s;olution, however was of &s;hort continuance, as her &s;ub&s;iding pa&s;&s;ions again gave her power to reflect, &s;he was convinced that by trying to clear her&s;elf of an imaginary crime &s;he &s;hould commit a real one, &s;ince to &s;ave her own character, Lord Cherbury's mu&s;t be &s;tig|matized, and the con&s;equence of &s;uch an act he had al|ready declared, &s;o that not only by the world but by her own con&s;cience, &s;he &s;hould for ever be accu&s;ed of accelerating his death.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="038416_0490_1011E5B2F822B658">
"It mu&s;t, it mu&s;t be made," &s;he wildly cried, "the &s;acrifice mu&s;t be made, and Mortimer is lo&s;t to me for|ever." She flung her&s;elf on the bed, and pa&s;&s;ed the hours till morning in agonies too great for de&s;cription. From a kind of &s;tupefaction rather than &s;leep, into which &s;he had gradually &s;unk towards morning, &s;he was arou&s;|ed by a gentle tap at the chamber door, and the voice of Si&s;ter Mary informing her that Lord Mortimer was be|low, and impatient for his breakfa&s;t.</P>
<P>Amanda &s;tarted from the bed, and bid her tell his Lord&s;hip &s;he would attend him immediately. She then adju&s;ted her dre&s;s, tried to calm her &s;pirits, and, with uplifted hands and eyes, be&s;ought Heaven to &s;upport her through the trials of the day.</P>
<P>Weak and trembling &s;he de&s;cended to the parlour. The moment &s;he entered it, Lord Mortimer, &s;hocked, and &s;urpri&s;ed by her altered looks, exclaimed, "Gracious Heaven! what is the matter? Then feeling the feveri&s;h heat of her hands continued, "Why, why, Amanda, had you the cruelty to conceal your illne&s;s? proper a&s;|&s;i&s;tance might have prevented its increa&s;ing to &s;uch a degree."&mdash;With unutterable tenderne&s;s he folded his arms about her, and&punc; while her drooping head &s;unk on his bo&s;om, declared he would immediately &s;end for the phy&s;ician who had before attended her.</P>
<P>"Do not," &s;aid Amanda, while tears trickled down her cheeks, "Do not," continued &s;he, in a broken voice, "for he could do me no good."</P>
<P>"No good," repeated Lord Mortimer, in a terrified accent.</P>
<P>"I mean," cried &s;he, recollecting her&s;elf, "he would find it unnece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;cribe any thing for me, as my illne&s;s only proceeds from the agitation I &s;uffered ye&s;ter|day; it made me pa&s;s an indifferent night, but quiet|ne&s;s to day will recover me."</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer was with difficulty per&s;uaded to give up his intention, nor would he relinqui&s;h it till &s;he had promi&s;ed, if not better before the evening, to inform him and let the phy&s;ician be &s;ent for.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="038416_0491_1011D044D1B71C48">
They now &s;at down to breakfa&s;t, at which Amanda was unable either to pre&s;ide or eat. When over, &s;he told Lord Mortimer &s;he mu&s;t retire to her chamber, as re&s;t was e&s;&s;ential for her; but between nine and ten in the evening &s;he would be happy to &s;ee him. He tried to per&s;uade her that &s;he might re&s;t as well upon the &s;ofa in the parlour as in her chamber, and that he might then be allowed to &s;it with her; but &s;he could not be per&s;uaded to this, &s;he &s;aid, and begged he would ex|cu&s;e &s;eeing her till the time &s;he had already mentioned.</P>
<P>He at la&s;t retired with great reluctance, but not till &s;he had &s;everal times de&s;ired him to do &s;o.</P>
<P>Amanda now repaired to her chamber, but not to in|dulge in the &s;upinene&s;s of grief, though her heart felt bur&s;ting, but to &s;ettle upon &s;ome plan for her future conduct. In the fir&s;t place &s;he meant immediately to write to Lord Cherbury, as the be&s;t method &s;he could take of acquainting him with her compliance, and pre|venting any conver&s;ation between them, which would now have been in&s;upportable to her.</P>
<P>In the next place &s;he de&s;igned acquainting the Prior|e&s;s with the &s;udden alteration in her affairs, only con|cealing from her the occa&s;ion of that alteration, and as but one day intervened between the pre&s;ent and the one fixed for her journey, meant to be&s;eech her to think of &s;ome place to which &s;he might retire from Lord Mor|timer.</P>
<P>Yet &s;uch was the opinion &s;he knew the Priore&s;s en|tertained of Lord Mortimer, that &s;he almo&s;t dreaded &s;he would impute her re&s;ignation of him to &s;ome crimi|nal motive, and abandon her entirely. If this &s;hould be the ca&s;e (and &s;carcely could &s;he be &s;urpri&s;ed if it was) &s;he re&s;olved without delay to go privately to the neighbouring town, and from thence proceed immedi|ately to Dublin; how &s;he &s;hould act there, or what would become of her, never entered her thoughts; they were wholly engro&s;&s;ed about the manner in which &s;he &s;hould leave St. Catherine's.</P>
<P>But &s;he hoped, much as appearances were again&s;t her, &s;he &s;hould not be de&s;erted by the Priore&s;s: Providence

<P>As &s;oon as &s;he had &s;ettled the line of conduct &s;he &s;hould pur&s;ue, &s;he &s;at down to pen her renunciation, of Lord Mortimer, which &s;he did in the following words:</P>

<P>To your wi&s;hes I re&s;ign my happine&s;s; my hap|pine&s;s I repeat, for it is due to Lord Mortimer to de|clare that, an union with &s;uch a character as his mu&s;t have produced the highe&s;t felicity: it is al&s;o due to my own to declare, that it was neither his rank or for|tune, but his virtues, which influenced my inclination in his favour.</P>
<P>Happy had it been for us all, my Lord, but parti|cularly for me, had you continued &s;teady in oppo&s;ing the wi&s;hes of your &s;on.

<P>But I will not do away any little merit your Lord|&s;hip may perhaps a&s;cribe to my immediate compliance with your reque&s;t, by dwelling upon the &s;ufferings it entails on me. May the renunciation of my hopes be the means of realizing your Lord&s;hip's, and may &s;upe|rior fortune bring &s;uperior happine&s;s to Lord Mortimer.</P>
<P>I thank your Lord&s;hip for your intentions relative to me: but whil&s;t I do &s;o, mu&s;t a&s;&s;ure you, both now and forever, I &s;hall decline having them executed for me.</P>

She ro&s;e, and walked to the window, to try if the air would remove the fainti&s;hne&s;s which oppre&s;&s;ed her: from it &s;he perceived Lord Mortimer and the Priore&s;s in deep conver&s;ation at a little di&s;tance from the convent; &s;he conjectured &s;he was their &s;ubject, for as Lord Mortimer retired, the Priore&s;s, whom &s;he had not &s;een that day before, came into her chamber.

<P>"Oh! no," &s;aid Amanda, with a convul&s;ive &s;ob&mdash;"oh! no," wringing her hands, "you are &s;adly mi&s;|taken." The Priore&s;s grew alarmed, her limbs began to tremble, &s;he was unable to &s;tand, and dropping on the neare&s;t chair, be&s;ought Amanda, in a voice expre&s;|&s;ive of her feelings, to explain the rea&s;on of her di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Amanda knelt before her, &s;he took her hands, &s;he pre&s;&s;ed them to her burning forehead and lips, and be|dewed them with her tears, whil&s;t &s;he exclaimed &s;he was wretched.</P>
<P>"Wretched!" repeated the Priore&s;s; "for Hea|ven's &s;ake be explicit; keep me no longer in &s;u&s;pence; you &s;icken my very heart by your agitation; it foretells &s;omething dreadful!"</P>
<P>"It does indeed," &s;aid Amanda; "it foretells that Lord Mortimer and I will never be united!"</P>
<P>The Priore&s;s &s;tarted, and &s;urveyed Amanda with a look which &s;eemed to &s;ay, "&s;he believed &s;he had lo&s;t her &s;en&s;es;" then with a&s;&s;umed compo&s;ure, begged "&s;he would defer any farther explanation of her di&s;tre&s;s till her &s;pirits were in a calmer &s;tate."</P>

Surely, my dear child, cried &s;he, "&s;hould know me too well to de&s;ire &s;uch an a&s;&s;urance; but however my&s;terious her &s;ituation may appear to others, &s;he will not I tru&s;t and believe, let it appear &s;o to me.

<P>"It is one of my greate&s;t &s;orrows," exclaimed A|manda, "that I cannot give &s;uch an explanation: No, no," &s;he continued in an agony, "a death-bed con|fe&s;&s;ion would not authori&s;e my telling you the occa&s;ion of Lord Mortimer's &s;eparation and mine."

She then in&s;i&s;ted on Amanda's lying down, and trying to compo&s;e her&s;elf, &s;he brought her drops to take, and drawing the curtains about her, retired from the room. In two hours &s;he returned; though &s;he entered the chamber &s;oftly, Amanda imme|diately drew back the curtain, and appeared much more compo&s;ed than when the Priore&s;s had left her. The

good woman would not let her ri&s;e, but &s;at down on the bed to tell her what &s;he had contrived for her.</P>
<P>"She had a relation in Scotland," &s;he &s;aid, "who from reduced circum&s;tances, had kept a &s;chool for many years; but as the infirmities of age came on, &s;he was not able to pay &s;o much attention to her pupils as their friends thought requi&s;ite, and &s;he had only been able to retain them by promi&s;ing to get a per&s;on to a&s;&s;i&s;t her, as &s;he thought her cou&s;in (the Priore&s;s) more in the way of procuring &s;uch a one than her&s;elf, &s;he had written to her for that purpo&s;e; a clever well-behaved young woman who would be &s;atisfied with a &s;mall &s;alary, was what &s;he wanted."</P>
<P>"I &s;hould not mention &s;uch a place to you," &s;aid the Priore&s;s, "but that the nece&s;&s;ity there is for your im|mediately retiring from Lord Mortimer, leaves me no time to look out for another: But do not imagine I wi&s;h you to continue there: No, indeed, I &s;hould think it a pity &s;uch talents as you po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;hould be buried in &s;uch ob&s;curity.&mdash;What I think is, that you can &s;tay there till you grow more compo&s;ed, and can look out for a better e&s;tabli&s;hment."</P>
<P>"Do not mention my talents," &s;aid Amanda, "my mind is &s;o enervated by grief, that it will be long before I can make any great exertion, and the place you have mentioned is, from its ob&s;curity, ju&s;t &s;uch a one as I de&s;ire to go to.</P>
<P>"There is be&s;ides another inducement," &s;aid the Priore&s;s, "namely, its being but a few miles from Port-Patrick, to which place a fair wind will bring us in a few hours from this. I know the ma&s;ter of a little wherry, which is perpetually going backwards and for|wards; he live, in this neighbourhood&punc; and both he and his wife con&s;ider them&s;elves under obligations to me, and will rejoice, I am &s;ure, at an opportunity of oblig|ing me: I &s;hall therefore &s;end for him this evening, in|forming him of the time you wi&s;h to go and de&s;ire his care till be leaves you him&s;elf at Mrs. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">."</P>

&s;he had already written a letter for her to take; but wi&s;hed to know whether &s;he would be mentioned by her own or a fictitious name?</P>
<P>Amanda replied, "By a fictitious one," and, after a little con&s;ideration, fixed on that of Frances Donald, which the Priore&s;s accordingly in&s;erted, and then read the letter.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Cou&s;in,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The bearer of this letter, Frances Donald, is the young per&s;on I have procured you for an a&s;&s;i&s;tant in your &s;chool&punc; I have known her &s;ome time, and can vouch for her cleverne&s;s and di&s;cretion. She is well born and well educated, and has &s;een better days; but the wheel of fortune is continually turning, and &s;he bears her misfor|tunes with a patience that to me is the be&s;t proof &s;he could give of a real good di&s;po&s;ition. I have told her you give but ten pounds a year; her going proves &s;he is not di&s;&s;atisfied with the &s;alary. I am &s;orry to hear you are troubled with rheumatic pains, and hope, when you have more time to take care of your&s;elf, you will grow better. All the &s;i&s;ters join me in thanking you for your kind enquiries after them. We do tolerably well in the little &s;chool we keep, and tru&s;t our gratitude to Heaven for its pre&s;ent goodne&s;s will obtain a continu|ance of it. I beg to hear from you &s;oon,</P>

<P>"I have not &s;aid as much as you de&s;erve," &s;aid the Priore&s;s; but if the letter does not meet your approba|tion, I will make any alteration you plea&s;e in it."&mdash;A|manda a&s;&s;ured her "it did," and the Priore&s;s then &s;aid, "that Lord Mortimer had been again at the Convent to inquire after her, and was told &s;he was better."&mdash;Aman|da
<PB N="98" REF="038416_0498_1011E59AA00BEB20">
&s;aid, &s;he would not &s;ee him till the hour &s;he had appointed for his coming to &s;upper.&mdash;The Priore&s;s agreed, "that as things were changed &s;he was right in being in his company as little as po&s;&s;ible, and to pre|vent her being in his way, &s;he &s;hould have her dinner and tea in her own room." The cloth was accordingly laid in it, nor would the good natured Priore&s;s depart till &s;he &s;aw Amanda eat &s;omething. Si&s;ter Mary, &s;he &s;aid, was quite anxious to come in, and perform the part of an attendant, but was prevented by her.</P>
<P>The di&s;traction of Amanda's thoughts was now aba|ted, from having every thing adju&s;ted relative to her fu|ture conduct, and the company of the Priore&s;s, who re|turned to her as &s;oon as &s;he had dined, prevented her lo&s;ing the little compo&s;ure &s;he had with &s;uch difficulty acquired.</P>
<P>She be&s;ought the Priore&s;s not to delay writing after her departure, and to relate faithfully every thing which happened in con&s;equence of her &s;light. She entreat|ed her not to let a mi&s;taken compa&s;&s;ion for her feel|ings influence her to conceal any thing, as any thing like the appearance of concealment in her letter would only torture her with anxiety and &s;u&s;pence.</P>
<P>The Priore&s;s &s;olemly promi&s;ed &s;he would obey her reque&s;t, and Amanda with tears regretted that &s;he was now unable to recompen&s;e the kindne&s;s of the Priore&s;s and the Si&s;terhood, and &s;he had lately intended doing by Lord Mortimer's de&s;ire, as well as her own inclination. The Priore&s;s begged her not to indulge any regret on that account, as they con&s;idered them&s;elves already libe|rally recompen&s;ed, and had be&s;ides quite &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy their humble de&s;ires.</P>
<P>Amanda &s;aid &s;he meant to leave a letter on the dre&s;|&s;ing table for Lord Mortimer, with the notes which he had given her enclo&s;ed in it. "The picture and the ring," &s;aid &s;he, with a falling tear, "I cannot part with;" for the things which &s;he had ordered from the neighbouring town, &s;he told the Priore&s;s &s;he would leave money in her hands, al&s;o a pre&s;ent for the woman who had been engaged to attend her to England, as
<PB N="99" REF="038416_0499_1011E59E55E7CDA8">
&s;ome &s;mall recompen&s;e for her di&s;appointment: She meant only to take &s;ome linen and her mourning to Scotland, the re&s;t of her things, including her mu&s;ic and books at &s;ome future and better period, might be &s;ent after her.</P>
<P>Amanda was indebted to the Si&s;terhood for three month's board and lodging, which was ten guineas. Of the two hundred pounds, which Lord Mortimer had given her on leaving Ca&s;tle Carberry, one hundred and twenty pounds remained, &s;o that though unable to an|&s;wer the claims of gratitude, &s;he thanked heaven &s;he was able to fulfil tho&s;e of ju&s;tice. This &s;he told the Priore&s;s, who in&s;tantly declared, "that, in the name of the whole Si&s;terhood, &s;he would take upon her to refu&s;e any thing from her." Amanda did not conte&s;t the point, being &s;ecretly determined how to act. The Priore&s;s drank tea with her. When over, Amanda &s;aid &s;he would lie down, in order to try and be compo&s;ed again&s;t Lord Mortimer came. The Priore&s;s accord|ingly withdrew, &s;aying, "&s;he &s;hould not be di&s;turbed till then."</P>
<P>By this means Amanda was enabled to be in readine&s;s for delivering her letter to Lord Cherbury at the proper hour. Her heart beat with apprehen&s;ion as it approach|ed; &s;he dreaded Lord Mortimer again &s;urpri&s;ing her among&s;t the ruins, or &s;ome of the Nuns following her to them. At la&s;t the clock gave the &s;ignal for keeping her appointment. She aro&s;e trembling from the bed, and opened the door; &s;he li&s;tened, and no noi&s;e announced any one's being near; the moments were precious; &s;he glided through the gallery, and had the good fortune to find the hall door open. She ha&s;tened to the ruins, and found Lord Cerbury waiting there. She pre&s;ented him the letter in &s;ilence. He received it in the &s;ame man|ner; but when he &s;aw her turning away to depart he &s;natched her hand, and in a voice that denoted the mo&s;t violent agitation, exclaimed, "Tell me, tell me, Mi&s;s Fitzalan, is this letter propitious?" "It is," replied &s;he in a faultering voice. "Then may heaven eternally ble&s;s you," cried he, falling at her feet, and wrapping
<PB N="100" REF="038416_0500_1011E5A0CC454FC8">
his arms about her. His po&s;ture &s;hocked Amanda, and his detention terrified her.</P>
<P>"Let me go, my Lord," &s;aid &s;he,: "In pity to me, in mercy to your&s;elf, let me go, for one moment longer and we may be di&s;covered."</P>
<P>Lord Cherbury &s;tarted up&mdash;"From whom," cried he, "can I hear about you?"</P>
<P>"From the Priore&s;s of St. Catherines," replied Amanda in a trembling voice, "&s;he only will know the &s;ecret of my retreat."</P>
<P>He again &s;natched her hand, and ki&s;&s;ed it with vehe|mence. "Farewell, thou angel of a woman?" he ex|claimed, and di&s;appeared among&s;t the ruins. Amanda hurried back, dreading every moment to meet Lord Mortimer; but &s;he neither met him nor any other per|&s;on. She had &s;carcely gained her chamber ere the Pri|ore&s;s came to inform her his Lord&s;hip was in the par|lour. She in&s;tantly repaired to it. The air had a little changed the deadly hue of her complexion, &s;o that from her looks he &s;uppo&s;ed her better, and her words &s;trength|ened the &s;uppo&s;ition. She talked with him, forced her|&s;elf to eat &s;ome &s;upper, and checked the tears from fal|ling, which &s;prang to her eyes whenever he mentioned the happine&s;s they mu&s;t experience when united, the plea&s;ure they &s;hould enjoy at Thornbury, and the de|light Lady Martha and Lady Araminta would expe|rience whenever they met.</P>
<P>Amanda de&s;ired him not to come to breakfa&s;t the next morning, nor to the Convent, till after dinner, as &s;he &s;hould be &s;o bu&s;y preparing for her journey, &s;he would have no time to devote to him. He wanted to c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nvince her he could not retard her preparations by coming, but &s;he would not allow this.</P>
<P>Amanda pa&s;&s;ed another wretched night. She break|fa&s;ted in the morning with the Nuns, who expre&s;&s;ed their regret at lo&s;ing her&mdash;a regret however mitigated by the hope of &s;hortly &s;eeing her again, as Lord Mor|timer had promi&s;ed to bring her to Ca&s;tle Carberry as &s;oon as &s;he had vi&s;ited his friends in England. This was a trying moment to Amanda; &s;he could &s;carcely conceal
<PB N="101" REF="038416_0501_1011E5A2641A1C78">
her emotions, to keep her&s;elf from weeping aloud, at the mention of a promi&s;e never to be fulfilled. She &s;wal|lowed her breakfa&s;t in ha&s;te, and withdrew to her cham|ber on pretence of &s;ettling her things. Here &s;he was immediately followed by the Nuns, entreating they might &s;everally be employed in a&s;&s;i&s;ting her. She thank|ed them with her u&s;ual &s;weetne&s;s, but a&s;&s;ured them no a&s;&s;i&s;tance was nece&s;&s;ary, as &s;he had but a few things to pack, never having unlocked the che&s;ts which had come from Ca&s;tle Carberry. They retired on receiving this a&s;&s;urance, and Amanda, fearful of another interruption, &s;at down to write her farewell letter to Lord Mortimer.</P>

<P>A de&s;tiny which neither of us can controul, forbids our union.

<P>This letter was bli&s;tered with her tears; She laid it in a drawer till evening, and then proceeded to pack whatever &s;he meant to take with her in a little trunk. In the mid&s;t of this bu&s;ine&s;s the Priore&s;s came in to in|form her &s;he had &s;een the ma&s;ter of the wherry, and &s;ettled every thing with him.

About three he was to come to the convent for her; he had al&s;o promi&s;ed to provide every thing nece&s;&s;ary on board for her.</P>
<P>Matters being thus arranged, Amanda told the Pri|ore&s;s, to avoid &s;u&s;picion. &s;he would leave the money &s;he intended for the woman, who had been engaged to ac|company her to England, on her dre&s;&s;ing table, with a few lines purporting who it was for. The Priore&s;s ap|proved of her doing &s;o, as it would prevent any one from &s;u&s;pecting &s;he as privy to her departure. She was obliged to leave her directly, and Amanda took the opportunity of putting up the fifteen guineas in a paper, five for the woman and ten for the nuns. She wi&s;hed to do more for them, but feared to obey the dic|tates of genero&s;ity, while her own pro&s;pect of provi&s;ion was &s;o uncertain. She wrote as follows to the Priore&s;s:</P>

<P>By this time &s;he was &s;ummoned to dinner. Her &s;pir|its were &s;unk in the lowe&s;t dejection at the idea of leav|ing the amiable woman who had been &s;o kind to her, and above all, at the idea of the la&s;t &s;ad evening &s;he was to pa&s;s with Lord Mortimer. His Lord&s;hip came early to the Convent. The dejected looks of Amanda immediately &s;truck him, and renewed all his appre|hen&s;ions about her health. She an&s;wered his tender enquiries by &s;aying &s;he was fatigued.</P>
<P>"Perhaps," &s;aid he "you will like to re&s;t one day, and not commence your journey to-morrow?"</P>
<P>"No, no," cried Amanda, "It &s;hall not be deferred. To-morrow," continued &s;he, with a &s;mile of angui&s;h, "I will commence it."</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="038416_0504_1011E5AB88678CE0">
Lord Mortimer thanked her for a re&s;olution, he ima|gined dictated by an ardent de&s;ire to plea&s;e him, but at the &s;ame time again expre&s;&s;ed his fears that &s;he was ill.</P>
<P>Amanda perceived that if &s;he did not exert her&s;elf, her dejection would lead him to enquiries &s;he would find it difficult to evade; but as to exert her&s;elf was impo&s;&s;i|ble, in order to withdraw his attention, in &s;ome degree, from her&s;elf, &s;he propo&s;ed that as this was the la&s;t even|ing they would be at the Convent, they would invite the Nuns to drink tea with them. Lord Mortimer immedi|ately acquie&s;ced in the propo&s;al, and the invitation be|ing &s;ent was accepted.</P>
<P>But the conver&s;ation of the whole party was of a me|lancholy kind. Amanda was &s;o much beloved among them, that the pro&s;pect of lo&s;ing her filled them with a regret, which, even the idea of &s;eeing her &s;oon again, could not bani&s;h. About nine, which was their hour for prayers, they ro&s;e to retire, and would have taken leave of Lord Mortimer, had he not informed them, that on Mi&s;s Fitzalan's account he would not commence the journey next day till ten o'clock, at which time he would again have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing them.</P>
<P>When they withdrew he endeavoured to cheer Aman|da, and be&s;ought her to exert her &s;pirits. Of his own accord, he &s;aid, he would leave her early, that &s;he might get as much re&s;t as po&s;&s;ible again&s;t the en&s;uing day: He accordingly ro&s;e to depart. What an agonizing moment for Amanda&mdash;to hear, to behold the man, &s;o tenderly beloved, for the la&s;t time, to think that ere that hour the next night &s;he &s;hould be far, far away from him, con&s;idered as a treacherous and ungrateful crea|ture, de&s;pi&s;ed, perhaps execrated, as a &s;ource of per|petual di&s;quiet and &s;orrow to him! Her heart &s;welled at tho&s;e ideas with feelings &s;he thought would bur&s;t it, and when he folded her to his bo&s;om, and bid her be cheer|ful again&s;t the next morning, &s;he involuntarily returned the pre&s;&s;ure, by &s;training him to her heart in convul&s;ive agitation, whil&s;t a &s;hower of tears bur&s;t from her.&mdash;Lord Mortimer, &s;hocked and &s;urpri&s;ed at the&s;e tears

and emotions, re-&s;eated her, for her agitation was con|tagious, and he trembled &s;o much he could not &s;upport her; then throwing him&s;elf at her feet." My Aman|da! my beloved girl!" cried he, "what is the matter? Is any wi&s;h of your heart yet unfulfilled? If &s;o, let no mi&s;taken notion of delicacy influence you to conceal it; on your happine&s;s you know mine depends; tell me therefore, I entreat, I conjure you, tell me, is there any thing I can do to re&s;tore you to cheerfulne&s;s?"</P>
<P>"Oh! no," &s;aid Amanda, "all that a mortal could do to &s;erve me you have already done, and my grati|tude, the fervent &s;en&s;e I have of the obligations I lie un|der to you, I cannot fully expre&s;s. May heaven," rai|&s;ing her &s;treaming eyes, "may heaven recompen&s;e your goodne&s;s, by be&s;towing the choice&s;t of its ble&s;&s;ings on you!"</P>
<P>"That," &s;aid Lord Mortimer, half &s;miling, "it has already done in giving you to me, for you are the choi|ce&s;t ble&s;&s;ing it could be&s;tow; but tell me what has de|jected you in this manner? &s;omething more than fatigue I am &s;ure?"</P>
<P>Amanda a&s;&s;ured him "he was mi&s;taken," and fearful of his further enquiries, told him, "&s;he only waited for his departure to retire to re&s;t, which &s;he was convinced would do her good."</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer in&s;tantly ro&s;e from his kneeling po&s;|ture: "Farewell, then, my dear Amanda," cried he, "farewell, and be well and cheerful again&s;t the morn|ing."</P>
<P>She pre&s;&s;ed his hand between her's and laying her cold wet cheek upon it: "Farewell," &s;aid &s;he, "when we next meet I &s;hall, I tru&s;t be well and cheerful; for in heaven alone (thought &s;he at that moment) we &s;hall ever meet again."</P>
<P>On the &s;pot in which he left her, Amanda &s;tood mo|tionle&s;s, till &s;he heard the hall door clo&s;e after him; all compo&s;ure then for&s;ook her, and in an agony of tears and &s;obs, &s;he threw her&s;elf on the &s;eat he had occupied. The good Priore&s;s, gue&s;&s;ing what her feelings at this minute mu&s;t be, was at hand, and came in with drops
<PB N="106" REF="038416_0506_1011E5AFF8F67178">
and water, which &s;he forced her to take, and mingled the tears of &s;ympathy with her's.</P>
<P>Her &s;oothing attentions in a little time had the effect &s;he de&s;ired. They revived, in &s;ome degree, her unhappy young friend, who exclaimed, "that the &s;evere&s;t trial &s;he could ever po&s;&s;ibly experience was now over."</P>
<P>"And will, I tru&s;t and believe," replied the Priore&s;s "even in this life be yet rewarded."</P>
<P>It was agreed that Amanda &s;hould put on her habit, and be prepared again&s;t the man came for her. The Priore&s;s promi&s;ed, as &s;oon as the hou&s;e was at re&s;t, to follow her to her chamber.&mdash;Amanda accordingly went to her apartment, and put on her travelling dre&s;s. She was &s;oon followed by the Priore&s;s, who brought in bread, wine, and cold chicken; but the full heart of Amanda would not allow her to partake of them, and her tears in &s;pite of her efforts to re&s;train them, again bur&s;t forth. "She was &s;ure," &s;he &s;aid, "the Priore&s;s would immediately let her know if any intelligence ar|rived of her brother, and &s;he again be&s;ought her to write as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible after her departure, and to be minute."</P>
<P>She left the letters, one for Lord Mortimer, and the other for the Priore&s;s, on the table, and then, with a kind of melancholy impatience, waited for the man, who was punctual to the appointed hour of three, and announced his arrival by a tap at the window. She in|&s;tantly ro&s;e, and embraced the Priore&s;s in &s;ilence, who almo&s;t as much affected as her&s;elf, had only power to &s;ay "God ble&s;s you, my dear child and make you as happy as you de&s;erve to be."</P>
<P>Amanda &s;hook her head mournfully, as if to &s;ay "&s;he expected no happine&s;s," and then &s;oftly &s;tepping along the gallery, opened the hall-door, where &s;he found the man waiting. Her little trunk was already lying in the hall: She pointed it out to him, and as &s;oon as he had taken it he departed. Never did any being feel more forlorn than Amanda now did; what &s;he did when quitting the Marchione&s;s's was comparatively happine&s;s to what &s;he now endured. She then looked forward to the protection, comfort and &s;upport, of a tender parent

now &s;he had nothing in view which could in the lea&s;t cheer or alleviate her feelings. She ca&s;t her mournful eyes around, and the objects &s;he beheld, heightened if po&s;&s;ible, her angui&s;h. She beheld the old trees which &s;haded the grave of her father waving in the morning breeze, and, oh! how fervently at that moment did &s;he wi&s;h that by his &s;ide &s;he was laid beneath their &s;helter! &s;he turned from them with a heart rending &s;igh, which. reached the ear of the man who trudged before her He in&s;tantly turned and &s;eeing her pale, and trembling, told her he had an arm at he &s;ervice, which &s;he gladly accepted, being &s;carcely able to &s;upport her&s;elf; a &s;mall boat was waiting for them about half a mile above Ca&s;|tle Carberry; it conveyed them in a few moments to the ve&s;&s;el, which the ma&s;ter previou&s;ly told her would be under weigh directly; &s;he was plea&s;ed to find his wife on board, who conducted Amanda to the cabin, where &s;he found breakfa&s;t laid out with neatne&s;s for her. She took &s;ome tea and a little bread being almo&s;t exhau&s;ted with fatigue. Her companion imputing her dejection to fears of cro&s;&s;ing the &s;ea, a&s;&s;ured her the pa&s;&s;age would be very &s;hort, and bid her ob&s;erve how plainly they could &s;ee the Scotti&s;h hills, now partially gilded by the beams of the ri&s;ing &s;un; but beautiful as they ap|peared, Amanda's eyes were turned from them to a more beautiful object, Ca&s;tle Carberry. She then a&s;ked the woman if &s;he thought the Ca&s;tle could be &s;een from the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t, and &s;he replied in the negative.</P>
<P>"I am &s;orry for it," &s;aid Amanda mournfully. She continued at the window for the melancholy plea&s;ure of contemplating it, till compelled by &s;ickne&s;s to lie down on the bed. The woman attended her with the mo&s;t a&s;|&s;iduous care, and about four o'clock in the afternoon in|formed her they had reached Port Patrick. Amanda aro&s;e, and &s;ending for the ma&s;ter, told him, "As &s;he did not wi&s;h to go to an inn, &s;he would thank him to hire a chai&s;e to carry her directly to Mrs. Macpher|&s;ons." He &s;aid &s;he &s;hould be obeyed, and Amanda having &s;ettled with him for her pa&s;&s;age, he went on &s;hore for that purpo&s;e, and &s;oon returned to inform her a car|riage
<PB N="108" REF="038416_0508_1011E5B693A59E08">
was ready.&mdash;Amanda, having thanked his wife for her kind attention, &s;tepped into the boat, and en|tered the chai&s;e the moment &s;he landed. Her compa|nion told her he was well acquainted with Mrs. Mac|pher&s;on having frequently carried pacquets from Mrs. Dermot to her. She lived about five miles from Port Patrick, he &s;aid, and near the &s;ea coa&s;t. They accor|dingly &s;oon reached her habitation; it was a &s;mall low hou&s;e, of a greyi&s;h colour, &s;ituated in the field almo&s;t covered with thi&s;tles, and divided from the road by a ragged looking wall; the &s;ea lay at a &s;mall di&s;tance from it; the coa&s;t hereabouts was extremely rocky, and the pro&s;pect on every &s;ide wild and dreary in the extreme.</P>
<P>Amanda's companion, by her de&s;ire, went fir&s;t into the hou&s;e, to prepare Mrs. Macpher&s;on for her recep|tion. He returned in a few minutes, and telling her &s;he was happy at her arrival, conducted her into the hou&s;e. From a narrow pa&s;&s;age they turned into a &s;mall gloomy looking parlour, with a clay floor. Mrs. Macpher&s;on was &s;itting in an old-fa&s;hioned arm chair&mdash;her face was &s;harp and meagre&mdash;her &s;tature low, and, like Otway's ancient Beldame, doubled with age: her gown was grey &s;tuff, and though &s;he was &s;o low, it was not long enough to reach her ancle; her black &s;ilk apron was curtailed in the &s;ame manner, and over a little mob cap &s;he wore a handkerchief tied under her chin. She ju&s;t nodded to Amanda on her entrance, and, putting on a large pair of &s;pectacles, &s;urveyed her without &s;peaking. Amanda pre&s;ented Mrs. Dermot's introductory letter, and then though unbidden, &s;eated her&s;elf on the window-&s;eat till &s;he had peru&s;ed it. Her trunk in the mean time was brought in, and &s;he paid for the carriage, reque&s;t|ing at the &s;ame time the ma&s;ter of the ve&s;&s;el to wait till &s;he had heard what Mrs. Macpher&s;on would &s;ay. At length the old Lady broke &s;ilence, and her voice was quite as &s;harp as her face.</P>
<P>"So child," &s;aid &s;he, again &s;urveying Amanda, and elevating her &s;pectacles to have a better opportunity of &s;peaking, "why, to be &s;ure I did de&s;ire my cou&s;in to

<P>"Lord ble&s;s you!" &s;aid the man, "if that is a fault, why it is one will mend every day."</P>
<P>"Aye, aye" cried the old Dame, but it will mend a little too &s;low for me: However, child, as you are &s;o well recommended, I will try you. My cou&s;in &s;ays &s;omething about your being well born, and having &s;een better days: however, child, I tell you before hand, I &s;hall not con&s;ider what you have been, but what you are now; I &s;hall therefore expect you to be mild, regular, and attentive; no flaunting, no gadding, no chattering, but &s;taid, &s;ober, and mode&s;t."</P>
<P>"Ble&s;s your heart," &s;aid the man," "if you look in her face you will &s;ee &s;he'll be all you de&s;ire."</P>
<P>"Aye, aye, &s;o you may &s;ay; but I &s;hould be very &s;orry to depend upon the promi&s;e of a face; like the heart, it is often treacherous and deceitful; &s;o pray, young woman, tell me, and remember I expect a con&s;ci|entious an&s;wer, whether you think you will be able to do as I wi&s;h.</P>
<P>"Yes, Madam," replied Amanda, in a voice almo&s;t choaked by the variety of painful emotions &s;he experi|enced.</P>
<P>"Well then we are agreed, as you know the &s;alary I give!" The ma&s;ter of the ve&s;&s;el now took his leave, never having been a&s;ked by Mrs. Macpher&s;on to take any refre&s;hment.</P>
<P>The heart of Amanda &s;unk within her from the mo|ment &s;he entered Mrs Macpher&s;on's door; &s;he &s;hudder|ed at being left with &s;o un&s;ocial a being in a place &s;o wild and dreary; a hovel near St. Catherine's &s;he would have thought a palace in point of real comfort to her pre&s;ent habitation, as &s;he then could have enjoyed the &s;oothing &s;ociety of the tender and amiable Nuns. The pre&s;ence of the ma&s;ter of the ve&s;&s;el, from the pity and concern he manife&s;ted for her, had &s;omething con&s;olato|ry in it, and when he left the room &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ur&s;t into tears, as if then, and not till then &s;he had been utterly aban|doned.
<PB N="110" REF="038416_0510_1011E5BAE0D4CCE8">
She ha&s;tily followed him out: "Give my love, my be&s;t love," &s;aid &s;he, &s;obbing violently, and laying her trembling hand on his, "to Mrs. Dermot, and tell her, oh! tell her to write directly, and give me &s;ome comfort."</P>
<P>"You may depend on my doing &s;o," replied he; "but cheer up my dear young lady, what, though the old Dame in the parlour is a little cranky, &s;he will mend no doubt, &s;o Heaven ble&s;s you, and make you as happy as you de&s;erve to be."</P>
<P>Sad and &s;ilent Amanda returned to the parlour, and &s;eating her&s;elf in the window, &s;trained her eyes after the carriage, which had brought her to this di&s;mal &s;pot.</P>

<P>"WELL, child," &s;aid Mrs. Macpher&s;on, "do you choo&s;e any thing?"</P>
<P>"I thank you, Madam," replied Amanda, I &s;hould like a little tea."</P>
<P>"Oh! as to tea I have ju&s;t taken my own, and the things are all wa&s;hed and put by; but if you like a gla&s;s of &s;pirits and water, and a cru&s;t of bread, you may have it."</P>
<P>Amanda &s;aid &s;he did not.</P>
<P>"Oh! very well," cried Mrs. Macpher&s;on, "I &s;hall not pre&s;s you, for &s;upper will from be ready." She then de&s;ired Amanda to draw a chair near her's, and began torturing her with a variety of minute and trifling que&s;|tions, relative to her&s;elf, the Nuns, and the neighbour|hood of St. Catherine's.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="038416_0511_1011E5BE84B11C60">
Amanda briefly &s;aid, "her father had been in the ar|my, that many di&s;appointments and lo&s;&s;es had prevented his making any provi&s;ion for her, and that on his death, which happened in the neighbourhood of the Convent, the Nuns had taken her out of compa&s;&s;ion till &s;he pro|cured an e&s;tabli&s;hment for her&s;elf."</P>
<P>"Aye, and a comfortable one you have procured your|&s;elf I promi&s;e you," &s;aid Mrs. Macpher&s;on, "if it is not your own fault." She then told Amanda, "&s;he would amu&s;e her by &s;hewing her her hou&s;e and other concerns." This indeed was ea&s;ily done, as it con&s;i&s;ted but of the parlour, two clo&s;ets adjoining it, and the kitchen on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the entry; the other concerns were a &s;mall garden planted with kale, and the field covered with thi&s;tles: "A good comfortable tenement this", cried Mrs. Macpher&s;on, &s;haking her head with much &s;atisfaction, as &s;he leaned upon her ebo|ny headed cane, and ca&s;t her eyes around. She bid A|manda admire the fine pro&s;pect before the door, and cal|ling to a red haired and bare-legged girl, de&s;ired her to cut &s;ome thi&s;tles to put into the fire, and ha&s;ten the boiling of the kal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> On returning to the parlour &s;he unlocked a pre&s;s, and took out a pair of coar&s;e brown &s;heets to air for Amanda. She her&s;elf &s;lept in one clo|&s;et, and in the other was a bed for Amanda, laid on a half decayed bed&s;tead, without curtains, and covered with a blue &s;tuff quilt; the clo&s;et was lightened by one &s;mall window, which looked into the garden, and its furniture con&s;i&s;ted of a broken chair, and a piece of looking gla&s;s &s;tuck to the wall.</P>
<P>The promi&s;ed &s;upper was at length &s;erved; it con|&s;i&s;ted of a few heads of kale, &s;ome oaten bread, a jug of water, and a &s;mall phial half full of &s;pirits, which A|manda would not ta&s;te, and the old Lady her&s;elf took but &s;paringly; they were lighted by a &s;mall candle, which, on retiring to their clo&s;ets, Mrs. Macpher&s;on cut between them.</P>
<P>Amanda felt relieved by being alone. She could now without re&s;traint indulge her tears, and her reflections; that &s;he could never enjoy any &s;atisfaction with a being
<PB N="112" REF="038416_0512_1011E5C0133AB2F0">
&s;o ungracious in her manners, and &s;o contracted in her notions, &s;he fore&s;aw; but, di&s;agreeable as her &s;ituation mu&s;t be, &s;he felt inclined to continue in it, from the idea of its giving her more opportunities of hearing from Mrs. Dermot than &s;he could have in almo&s;t any other place, and by the&s;e opportunities alone could &s;he expect to hear of Lord Mortimer, and to hear of him, even the mo&s;t trifling circum&s;tance, though divided, for ever divided from him, would be a &s;ource of exqui&s;ite though melancholy plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>To think &s;he &s;hould hear of him, at once &s;oothed and fed her melancholy, it le&s;&s;ened the violence of &s;orrow, yet without abating its inten&s;ene&s;s, it gave a delicious &s;adne&s;s to her &s;oul, &s;he thought would be ill exchanged for any feelings &s;hort of the&s;e &s;he mu&s;t have experienced if her wi&s;hes had been accompli&s;hed; &s;he enjoyed the pen&s;ive luxury of virtuous grief, which mitigates the &s;harp

<L>And turns his tears to rapture.</L></Q></P>
<P>Fatigued by the contending emotions &s;he experienced as well as the &s;ickne&s;s &s;he went through at &s;ea, Amanda &s;oon retired to her flock bed, and fell into a profound &s;lumber, in which &s;he continued till rou&s;ed in the morn|ing
<PB N="113" REF="038416_0513_1011E5C2A0DF63D8">
by the &s;hrill voice of Mrs. Macpher&s;on, exclaim|ing, as &s;he rapped at the door, "Come, come, Fran|ces, it is time to ri&s;e."</P>
<P>Amanda &s;tarted from her &s;leep, forgetting both the name &s;he had adopted, and the place where &s;he was; but Mrs. Macpher&s;on again calling her to ri&s;e, re&s;tored her to her recollection. She replied, &s;he would attend her directly, and hurrying on her clothes was with her in a few minutes. She found the old lady &s;eated at the breakfa&s;t table, who, in&s;tead of returning her &s;aluta|tion, &s;aid, "that on account of her fatigue &s;he excu&s;ed her lying &s;o long in bed this morning, for it was now near eight o'clock; but in future &s;he would expect her to ri&s;e before &s;ix in &s;ummer, and &s;even in winter, adding, as there was no clock, &s;he would rap at the door for that purpo&s;e every morning."</P>
<P>Amanda a&s;&s;ured her "&s;he was fond of ri&s;ing early, and always accu&s;tomed to it." The tea was now poured out, it was of the wor&s;t kind, and &s;weetened with coar&s;e brown, &s;ugar, the bread was oaten, and there was no but|ter. Amanda unu&s;ed to &s;uch unpalatable fare, &s;wallow|ed a little of it with difficulty, and then with &s;ome he&s;i|tation, &s;aid, "&s;he would prefer milk to tea."Mrs. Macpher&s;on frowned exceedingly at this, and, after continuing &s;ilent a few minutes, &s;aid, "&s;he had really made tea for two people, and &s;he could not think of having it wa&s;ted; be&s;ides (&s;he added) the economy of her hou&s;e was &s;o &s;ettled &s;he could not infringe it for any tone. She kept no cow her&s;elf, and only took in as much milk as &s;erved her tea, and an old tabby cat."</P>
<P>Amanda replied it was of no con&s;equence, and Mrs. Macpher&s;on &s;aid, indeed &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed &s;o, and muttered &s;omething of people giving them&s;elves airs they had no pretentions to. The tea table was removed before nine, when the &s;chool began; it con&s;i&s;ted of about thirty girls&punc; mo&s;t of them daughters to farmers in the neigh|bourhood. Amanda and they being introduced to each other, and &s;he being previou&s;ly informed what they were taught, was de&s;ired to commence the ta&s;k of in&s;tructing

them entirely her&s;elf that day, as Mrs. Macpher&s;on wan|ted to ob&s;erve her manner&mdash;a mo&s;t unplea&s;ant ta&s;k in|deed for poor Amanda, who&s;e mind and body were both harra&s;&s;ed by anxiety and fatigue. As &s;he had underta|ken it, however, &s;he re&s;olved to go through it with as much cheerfulne&s;s and alacrity as po&s;&s;ible; &s;he accord|ingly acquitted her&s;elf to the &s;atisfaction of Mrs. Mac|pher&s;on, who only found fault with her too great gen|tlene&s;s, &s;aying, the children would never fear her. At two the &s;chool broke up, and Amanda almo&s;t as delight|ed as the children to be at liberty, was running into the garden to try if the air would be of u&s;e to a very vi|olent head-ach, when &s;he was called back, to put the forms and other things in order; &s;he coloured, and &s;tood motionle&s;s, till recollecting that if &s;he refu&s;ed to obey Mrs. Macpher&s;on, a quarrel would probably en|&s;ue, which circum&s;tanced as &s;he was, without knowing where to go to, would be dreadful, &s;he &s;ilently perform|ed what &s;he had been de&s;ired to do. Dinner was then brought in; it was as &s;imple and as &s;paring as a Bramin could de&s;ire to be. When over, Mrs. Macpher&s;on com|po&s;ed her&s;elf to take a nap in the large chair, without making any kind of apology to Amanda.</P>
<P>Left at liberty, Amanda would now have walked out; but it had ju&s;t began to rain, and every thing looked dreary and de&s;olate; from the window in which &s;he pen|&s;ively <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">at &s;he had a view of the &s;ea; it looked black and tempe&s;tuous, and &s;he could di&s;tingui&s;h its awful and melancholy roaring as it da&s;hed again&s;t the rocks. The little &s;ervant girl, as &s;he cleaned the kitchen, &s;ung a di&s;|mal Scotch ditty, &s;o that all con&s;pired to oppre&s;s the &s;pi|rits of Amanda with a dejection greater than &s;he had ever before experienced; all hope was now extinct, the &s;ocial ties of life &s;eemed broken never more to be re|united. She had now no father, no friend, no lover, as heretofore, to &s;oothe her feelings, or alleviate her &s;or|rows. Like the poor Belvidera, &s;he might have &s;aid,

Like a tender &s;apling, tran&s;planted from its native &s;oil, &s;he &s;eemed to &s;tand alone expo&s;ed to every adver&s;e bla&s;t. Her tears gu&s;hed forth, and fell in &s;howers down her pale cheeks. She &s;ighed forth the name of her father; "Oh! dear and mo&s;t benignant of men," &s;he exclaim|ed, "my father and my friend, were you living I &s;hould not be &s;o wretched; pity and con&s;olation would then be mine: Oh! my father, one of the drearie&s;t caverns in yonder rocks would be an a&s;ylum of comfort were you with me; but I am &s;elfi&s;h in the&s;e regrets, certain as I am, that you exchanged this life of wretchedne&s;s for one of eternal peace, for one where you were again united to your Malvina."</P>
<P>Her thoughts adverted to what Lord Mortimer, in all probability now thought of her; but this was too dreadful to dwell upon, convinced as &s;he was, that, from appearances, he mu&s;t think mo&s;t unfavourably of her. His picture, which hung in her bo&s;om, &s;he drew out; &s;he gazed with agonizing tenderne&s;s upon it; &s;he pre&s;&s;|ed it to her lips and prayed for its original. From this indulgence of &s;orrow &s;he was di&s;turbed by the waking of Mrs. Macpher&s;on. She ha&s;tily wiped away her tears, and hid the beloved picture. The evening pa&s;t mo&s;t di&s;agreeably. Mrs. Macpher&s;on was tedious and inqui&s;itive in her di&s;cour&s;e, and it was almo&s;t as pain|ful to li&s;ten as to an&s;wer her.&mdash;Amanda was happy when the hour of retiring to bed arrived, and relieved her from what might be called a kind of mental bondage.</P>

Such was the fir&s;t day Amanda pa&s;&s;ed in her new habitation, and a week elap&s;ed in the &s;ame manner with|out any variation, except that on Sunday &s;he had a ce&s;|&s;ation from her labours, and went to the kirk with Mrs. Macpher&s;on. At the end of the week &s;he found her|&s;elf &s;o extremely ill from the fatigue and confinement &s;he endured, as Mrs. Macpher&s;on would not let her walk out, &s;aying "gadders were good for nothing; that &s;he told her, "except allowed to go out every evening &s;he mu&s;t leave her, as &s;he could not bear &s;o &s;edentary a life." Mrs. Macpher&s;on looked di&s;concerted, and grumbled a great deal; but as Amanda &s;poak in a re&s;o|lute manner &s;he was frightened, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t &s;he &s;hould put her threats into execution, &s;he was &s;o extremely u&s;eful in the &s;chool, and at la&s;t told her, "&s;he might take as much exerci&s;e as &s;he plea&s;ed every day after dinner."</P>
<P>Amanda gladly availed her&s;elf of this permi&s;&s;ion, &s;he explored all the romantic paths about the hou&s;e, but the one &s;he chiefly delighted to take was that which led to the &s;ea; &s;he loved to ramble about the beach, when fatigued to &s;it down upon the fragment of a rock, and look towards the oppo&s;ite &s;hore; vainly then would &s;he try to di&s;cover &s;ome of the objects &s;he knew &s;o well: Ca&s;tle Carberry was utterly undi&s;tingui&s;hable&punc; but &s;he knew the &s;pot on which it &s;tood, and derived a me|lancholy plea&s;ure from looking that way.</P>
<P>In the&s;e retired rambles &s;he would freely indulge her tears, and gaze upon the picture of Lord Mortimer. She feared no ob&s;ervation, the rocks formed a kind of rece&s;s about her, and in going to them &s;he &s;eldom met a creature.</P>
<P>A fortnight pa&s;&s;ed in this way, and &s;he began to feel &s;urpri&s;e and unea&s;ine&s;s, at not hearing from Mrs. Dermot; if much longer &s;ilent, &s;he re&s;olved on writing, feeling it impo&s;&s;ible to endure much longer the agony her ignorance of Lord Mortimer's proceeding gave her. The very morning, previous to the one &s;he had fixed for writing, &s;he &s;aw a &s;ailor coming to the hou&s;e, and believing he was the bearer of a letter to her, &s;he for|got every thing but her feelings at the moment, and

&s;tarting from her &s;eat ran from the room&mdash;She met him a few yards from the hou&s;e, and then perceived he was one of the &s;ailors of the ve&s;&s;el &s;he had came over in. "You have a letter for me I hope?" &s;aid Amanda. The man nodded, and fumbling in his bo&s;om for a mo|ment pulled out a large pacquet, which Amanda &s;natch|ed with eager tran&s;port from him; and knowing &s;he could not attempt to bring him into the hou&s;e for refre&s;h|ment, gave him a crown to procure it el&s;ewhere, which he received with thankfulne&s;s, and departed. She then returned to the parlour, and was ha&s;tening to her clo&s;et to read the letter, when Mrs. Macpher&s;on &s;topped her. "Hey day," cried &s;he "what is the matter? What is all this fu&s;s about? Why, one would think that was a love letter, you are &s;o very eager to read it."</P>
<P>"It is not then, I can a&s;&s;ure you," &s;aid Amanda.</P>
<P>"Well, well, and who is it from?"&mdash;Amanda re|flected, that if &s;he &s;aid from Mrs. Dermot, a number of impertinent que&s;tions would be a&s;ked her, &s;he therefore replied, "from a very particular friend."</P>
<P>"From a very particular friend! Well, I &s;uppo&s;e there is nothing about life or death in it, &s;o you may wait till after dinner to read it, and pray &s;it down now, and hear the children their &s;pelling le&s;&s;ons." This was a tantalizing moment to Amanda; &s;he &s;tood he&s;itating whether &s;he &s;hould obey, till reflecting, that if &s;he went now to read the pacquet, &s;he &s;hould mo&s;t probably be interrupted ere &s;he had got through half the contents, &s;he re&s;olved on putting it up till after dinner&mdash;The moment at la&s;t came for Mrs. Macpher&s;on's u&s;ual nap, and Amanda in&s;tantly ha&s;tened to a rece&s;s among&s;t the rocks, where &s;eating her&s;elf &s;he broke the &s;eal: the envelop contained two letters: the fir&s;t &s;he ca&s;t her eyes upon was directed in Lord Cherbury's hand. She trem|bled, tore it open and read as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO MISS FITZALAN.</HEAD>
<P>In vain, my dear Madam, do you &s;ay you never will receive pecuniary favours from me. It is not you, but I, &s;hould lie under obligations from their acceptance.
<PB N="118" REF="038416_0518_1011E5D224127F40">
I &s;hould deem my&s;elf the mo&s;t ungrateful of mankind if I did not in&s;i&s;t on carrying this point: I am ju&s;t re|turned to London, and &s;hall immediately order my law|yer t draw up a deed, entitling you to three hundred pounds a year, which when completed, I &s;hall tran&s;mit to the Priore&s;s (as I have this letter) to &s;end to you. I am &s;en&s;ible, indeed that I never can recompen&s;e the &s;a|crifice you have made me, the feelings it has excited I &s;hall not attempt to expre&s;s, becau&s;e language could never do them ju&s;tice; but you may cenceive what I mu&s;t feel for the being who has pre&s;erved me from di&s;|honour and de&s;truction. I am informed Lord Morti|mer has left Ireland, and therefore daily expect him in town. I have now not only every hope, but every pro&s;|pect of his complying with my wi&s;hes: This I imagine, will be rather plea&s;ing to you to hear, that you may know the &s;acrifice you have made is not made in vain; but will be attended with all the good con&s;equences I expected to derive from it. I &s;hould again enjoy a tolerable degree of peace were I a&s;&s;ured you were hap|py; but this is an a&s;&s;urance I will hope &s;oon to receive, for if you are not happy, who has a right to expect being &s;o? you who&s;e virtue is &s;o pure, who&s;e genero&s;ity is &s;o noble, &s;o heroic, &s;o far &s;uperior to any I have ever met with?</P>
<P>That in this world, as well as the next, you may be rewarded for it, is, dear madam, the &s;incere wi&s;h of him, who has the honour to &s;ub&s;cribe him&s;elf,</P>

<P>"Unfeeling man!" exclaimed Amanda, "how little is your heart intere&s;ted in what you write, and how &s;light do you make of the &s;acrifice I have made you, how cruelly mention your hopes which are derived from the de&s;truction of mine! No, &s;ooner would I wander from door to door for charity, than be indebted to your

o&s;tentatious gratitude for &s;upport, you who&s;e treachery and vile deceit have ruined my happine&s;s." She clo&s;ed the letter, and committing it to her pocket, took up the other, which &s;he &s;aw by the direction was from her dear Mrs. Dermot.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO MISS DONALD.</HEAD>
<P>Ah! my dear child, why extort a promi&s;e from me of being minute in relating every thing which happened in con&s;equence of your departure, a promi&s;e &s;o &s;olemnly given that I dare not recede from it; yet mo&s;t unwil|lingly do I keep it, &s;en&s;ible as I am that the intelligence I have to communicate will but aggravate you &s;orrows. Methinks I hear you exclaim at this; &s;urely, my dear Mrs. Dermot, you who know my di&s;po&s;ition and temper &s;o well, might &s;uppo&s;e I would receive &s;uch intelligence with a fortitude and patience that would prevent its ma|terially injuring me; well, my dear, hoping this will be the ca&s;e, I begin, without farther delay, to communi|cate particulars.</P>
<P>You left me, you may remember about three o'clock; I then went to bed, but &s;o fatigued and oppre&s;&s;ed I could &s;carcely &s;leep, and was quite unrefre&s;hed by what I did get. After prayers I repaired to the parlour, where the a&s;&s;iduous care of &s;i&s;ter Mary had already prepared every thing for your breakfa&s;t and Lord Mortimer's. I told the &s;i&s;ters not to appear till they were &s;ent for. I had not been long alone when Lord Mortimer came in, cheerful, blooming, animated. Never did I &s;ee happi|ne&s;s &s;o &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed in any countenance as in his; he looked indeed the lover about receiving the precious reward of con&s;tancy. He a&s;ked me had I &s;een you? I an&s;wered No. He &s;oon grew impatient, &s;aid you were a lazy girl, and feared you would make a bad traveller. He then rang the bell, and de&s;ired the maid to go and call you. Oh! my dear girl, my heart almo&s;t died with|in me at this moment; I averted my head and pretended to be looking in the garden to conceal my confu&s;ion.&mdash;The maid returned in a few minutes, and &s;aid you were not above. Well, &s;aid Lord Mortimer, &s;he is in &s;ome
<PB N="120" REF="038416_0520_1011E5D7ED3ECF38">
other apartment, pray &s;earch and ha&s;ten her hither. In a few minutes after &s;he departed, &s;i&s;ter Mary, all pale and breathle&s;s, ru&s;hed into the room: "Oh, heavens!" cried &s;he, "Mi&s;s Fitzalan cannot be found, but here are two letters, I found on her dre&s;&s;ing table, one for you, Ma|dam, and one for Lord Mortimer." I know not how he looked at this in&s;tant, for a guilty con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s came over my mind, which prevented my rai&s;ing my eyes to his. I took the letter in &s;ilence, opened, but had no power to read it. Si&s;ter Mary &s;tood by me, wringing her hands and weeping, as &s;he exclaimed, "What&mdash;what does &s;he &s;ay to you?" I could neither an&s;wer her nor move <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ill a deep &s;igh or rather groan from Lord Mor|timer rou&s;ed me. I &s;tarted from my &s;eat, and perceived him pale and motionle&s;s, the letter open in his hand, up|on which his eyes were rivetted. I threw open the gar|den door to give him air; this a little revived him. "Be comforted my Lord," &s;aid I. "He &s;hook his head mournfully, and waving his hand for me neither to &s;peak or follow him, pa&s;&s;ed into the garden,&mdash;"Ble&s;&s;ed Heaven!" &s;aid Si&s;ter Mary again, "what does &s;he &s;ay to you?" I gave her your letter, and de&s;ired her to read it aloud, for the tears which flowed at the affecting &s;i|tuation of Lord Mortimer, quite ob&s;cured my &s;ight; and here my dear child, I mu&s;t declare, that you have been too generous, and al&s;o, that the &s;um you betrayed us into taking is but con&s;idered as a loan by us; but, to return to my fir&s;t &s;ubject, the alarm concerning you now became general, and the nuns crowded into the room grief and con&s;ternation in every countenance. In about half an hour I &s;aw Lord Mortimer returning to the par|lour, and I then di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them. He had been endea|vouring to compo&s;e him&s;elf, but his efforts for doing &s;o were ineffectual. He trembled, was pale as death, and &s;poke with a faultering voice. He gave me your letter to read, and I put mine into his hand. "Well, my Lord," &s;aid I, on peru&s;ing it, we mu&s;t rather pity than condemn her."</P>
<P>"From my &s;oul," cried he, "I pity her&mdash;I pity &s;uch a being as Amanda Fitzalan, for being the &s;lave, the
<PB N="121" REF="038416_0521_1011E5D980E971B8">
prey of vice but &s;he has been cruel to me, &s;he has deceived, inhumanly deceived me, and bla&s;ted my peace forever.</P>
<P>"Ah, my Lord!" I replied "though appearances are again&s;t her, I can never believe her guilty; &s;he who performed all the duties of a child as Amanda Fitzalan did, and who to my certain knowledge, was preparing her&s;elf for a life of poverty, can never be a victim to vice."</P>
<P>"Mention her no more," cried he "her name is like a dagger to my heart; the &s;u&s;picions, which but a few nights ago I could have killed my&s;elf for entertaining, are now confirmed; they intruded on my mind from &s;ee|ing Belgrave haunting this place, and from finding her &s;ecreted amid&s;t the ruins at a late hour. Ah, heavens! when I noticed her confu&s;ion, how ea&s;ily did &s;he exculpate her&s;elf to a heart prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed like mine in her favour. Unhappy&mdash;unfortunate girl&mdash;&s;ad and pitiable is thy fate! but may an early repentance &s;natch thee from the villain who row triumphs in thy ruin, and may we, &s;ince thus &s;eparated, never meet again. So well," con|tinued he, "am I convinced of the cau&s;e of her flight, that I &s;hall not make one enquiry after her. I again attempted to &s;peak in your ju&s;tification, but he &s;ilen|ced me&punc; I begged he would allow me to get him break|fa&s;t. He could touch nothing, and &s;aid he mu&s;t re|turn directly to Ca&s;tle Carberry, but promi&s;ed in the cour&s;e of the day to &s;ee me again. I followed him into the hall; at the &s;ight of your corded boxes he &s;tarted, and &s;hrunk back with that kind of melancholy horror which we involuntarily feel when viewing any thing that belonged to a dear lo&s;t friend. I &s;aw his emotions were agonizing; he hid his face with his handkerchief, and with a ha&s;ty &s;tep a&s;cended to his carriage, which, with a travelling chai&s;e, was waiting at the door.</P>
<P>"I own I was often tempted, in the cour&s;e of conver|&s;ation, to tell him all I knew about you; but the promi&s;e I had given you &s;till ro&s;e to my view, and I felt, with|out your permi&s;&s;ion, I could not break it; yet, my dear,
<PB N="122" REF="038416_0522_1011E5DC6E338B90">
it is &s;hocking to me to have &s;uch imputations ca&s;t on you. We cannot blame Lord Mortimer for them; &s;itu|ated as you were with him, your conduct has naturally excited the mo&s;t injurious &s;u&s;picions; &s;urely, my child, though not allowed to &s;olve the my&s;tery which has &s;epa|ted you from him, you may be allowed to vindicate your conduct, the &s;acrifice of fame and happine&s;s is too much; con&s;ider and weigh well what I &s;ay, and if po&s;|&s;ible, authorize me to inform Lord Mortimer that I know of your retreat, and that you have retired neither to a lover or a friend, but to indigence and ob&s;curity, led thither by a fatal nece&s;&s;ity which you are bound to conceal, and feel more &s;everely from that circum&s;tance; he would, I am confident, credit my words, and then, in&s;tead of condemning, would join me in pitying you. The more I reflect on your unaccountable &s;eparation, the more am I bewildered in conjectures relative to it, and convinced more &s;trongly than ever of the frailty of hu|man joy, which like a &s;ummer cloud, is bright, but tran&s;itory in its &s;plendor. Lord Mortimer had left the convent about two hours, when his man arrived to di&s;|mi&s;s the travelling chai&s;e and attendants: I went out and enquired after his Lord. "He is very bad Ma|dam," &s;aid he, "and this has been a &s;ad morning for us all." Never, my dear Mi&s;s Fitzalan, did I, or the &s;i&s;terhood, pa&s;s &s;o melancholy a day. About five in the afternoon I received another vi&s;it from Lord Mortimer; I was alone in the parlour, which he en|tered with an appearance of the deepe&s;t melancholy; one of his arms was in a &s;ling; I was terrified, le&s;t he and Belgrave had met. He conjectured, I fancy, the occa&s;ion of the terror my countenance expre&s;&s;ed, for he immediately &s;aid he had been ill on returning to Ca&s;tle Carberry, and was bled. He was &s;etting off for Dublin directly, he &s;aid, from whence he intended to embark for England; but I could not depart, my dear good friend, (continued he) without bidding you fare|well; be&s;ides I wanted to a&s;&s;ure you, that any promi&s;e which the unfortunate girl made you in my name I &s;hall hold &s;acred. I knew he alluded to the fifty pounds which
<PB N="123" REF="038416_0523_1011E5E0CBB21078">
he de&s;ired you to tell me &s;hould be annually remitted to our hou&s;e: I in&s;tantly therefore replied, that we had already been rewarded beyond our expectation or de&s;ires for any little attention we &s;hewed Mi&s;s Fitza|lan; but his generous re&s;olution was not to be &s;haken. He looked weak and exhau&s;ted. I begged permi&s;&s;ion to make tea for him ere he commenced his journey. He con&s;ented, I went out of the room to order in the things. When I returned he was &s;tanding at the win|dow which looked into the garden, &s;o ab&s;orbed in meditation, he did not her me. I heard him &s;ay, "cruel Amanda! is it thus you have rewarded my &s;ufferings!" I retreated le&s;t he &s;hould be confu&s;ed by &s;uppo&s;ing him&s;elf overheard, and did not return till the maid brought in the tea things.</P>
<P>"When he aro&s;e to depart he looked wavering and agitated, as if there was &s;omething on his mind he wanted courage to &s;ay. At la&s;t, in a faultering voice, while the deadly palene&s;s of his complexion gave way to a deep crim&s;on, he &s;aid, "I left Mi&s;s Fitzalan's letter with you."</P>
<P>"Ah! my dear! never did man love woman better than he did, than he now loves you. I took the letter from my pocket, and pre&s;ented it to him. He put it in his bo&s;om with an emotion that &s;hook his whole frame. I hailed this as a favourable opportunity for again &s;peaking in your favour: I bid him retro&s;pect your pa&s;t actions, and judge from them whether you could be guilty of a crime&mdash;. He &s;topped me &s;hort; he begged me to drop a &s;ubject he was unable to bear. Had he been le&s;s credulous he &s;aid, he &s;hould now have been much happier; then wringing my hand he bid me farewell, in a voice and with a look that drew tears from me, "Ah, my dear Madam!" cried he, "when this day commenced, how differently did I think it would have terminated?"</P>
<P>I attended him to his carriage; he was obliged to lean upon his man as he a&s;cended it, and his looks and agita|tion proclaimed the deepe&s;t di&s;tre&s;s. I have &s;ent repeat|edly to Ca&s;tle Carberry &s;ince his departure to inquire
<PB N="124" REF="038416_0524_1011E5E265FAC740">
about him, and have been informed, that they expect to hear nothing of him till Lord Cherbury's agent comes into the country, which will not be the&s;e three months.</P>
<P>I have heard much of the good he did in the neigh|bourhood; he was a bounteous and benevolent &s;pirit indeed; to our community he has been a liberal bene|factor, and our prayers are daily offered up for his re&s;|toration to health and tranquillity. Among his other actions, when in Dublin, about three months ago, he ordered a monument to the memory of Captain Fitza|lan, which has been brought down &s;ince your depar|ture, and put up in the pari&s;h church where he is inter|red. I &s;ent Si&s;ter Mary and another of the nuns the other evening to &s;ee it, and they brought me a de&s;cription of it; it is a white marble urn, ornamented with a fo|liage of laurel, and &s;tanding upon a pede&s;tal of grey, on which the name of the decea&s;ed, and words to the follow|ing effect, are in&s;cribed, namely, "That he who&s;e memory it perpetuates, performed the duties of a Chri&s;tian and a &s;oldier, with a fidelity and zeal that now warrants his enjoying a ble&s;&s;ed recompence for both."</P>
<P>I know this proof of re&s;pect to your father will deeply affect you; but I would not omit telling it, becau&s;e though it will affect, I am confident it will al&s;o plea&s;e you. The late events have ca&s;t a gloom over all our &s;pirits. Si&s;ter Mary now prays more than ever, and you know I have often told her &s;he was only fit for a religious vocation; it is a bad world &s;he &s;ays we live in, and &s;he is glad &s;he has &s;o little to &s;ay to it.</P>
<P>I am longing to hear from you. Pray tell me how you like Mrs. Macpher&s;on; I have not &s;een her &s;ince her youth, and years often produce as great a change in the temper as the face; at any rate your pre&s;ent &s;ituation is too ob&s;cure for you to continue in, and as &s;oon as your thoughts are collected and compo&s;ed you mu&s;t look out for another. I hope you will be con&s;tant in writing; but I tell you beforehand, you mu&s;t not expect me to be punctual in my an&s;wers; I have been &s;o long di&s;u&s;ed to writing, and my eyes are grown &s;o weak; this letter has been the work of many days, be&s;ides, I have really no|thing

intere&s;ting to communicate, whenever I have, you may be a&s;&s;ured I &s;hall not lo&s;e a moment in in|forming you.</P>
<P>The woman was extremely thankful for the five gui|neas you left her. Lord Mortimer &s;ent five more by his man, &s;o that &s;he thinks her&s;elf well rewarded for any trouble or di&s;appointment &s;he experienced. If you wi&s;h to have any of your things &s;ent to you, acquaint me, you know I &s;hall never want an opportunity by the ma&s;ter of the ve&s;&s;el. He &s;peaks largely of your gene|ro&s;ity to him, and expre&s;&s;es much pity at &s;eeing &s;o young a per&s;on in &s;uch melancholy. May Heaven if it does not remove the &s;ource, at lea&s;t le&s;&s;en this melancholy.</P>
<P>If po&s;&s;ible, allow me to write to Lord Mortimer, and vindicate you from the unworthy &s;u&s;picions he enter|tains of you: I know he would believe me, and I &s;hould do it without di&s;covering your retreat.

</LETTER>
<P>Poor Amanda wept over this letter. "I have ruined the health, the peace of Lord Mortimer," &s;he exclaim|ed, "and he now execrates me as the &s;ource of his un|happine&s;s. Oh! Lord Cherbury, how &s;everely do I &s;uf|fer for your crime!" She began to think her virtue had been too heroic in the &s;acrifice &s;he had made; but this was a tran&s;ient idea, for when &s;he reflected on the di&s;|po&s;ition of Lord Cherbury, &s;he was convinced the di|vulgement of his &s;ecret would have been followed by his death, and, great as was her pre&s;ent wretchedne&s;s, &s;he felt it light compared to the horrors &s;he knew &s;he would experience, could &s;he accu&s;e her&s;elf of being acce&s;&s;ary to &s;uch an event; &s;he now drank deeply of the cup of mi&s;ery, but con&s;cious rectitude, in &s;ome degree, le&s;&s;ened its noxious bitterne&s;s. She re&s;olved to caution Mrs. Dermot again&s;t mentioning her in any manner to Lord Mortimer. She was well convinced he would believe
<PB N="126" REF="038416_0526_1011E5E71CB37920">
no a&s;&s;everation of her innocence, and even if he did, what end could it an&s;wer? their union was oppo&s;ed by an ob&s;tacle not to be &s;urmounted, and if he &s;ought and di&s;covered her retreat, it would only lead to new &s;or|rows, perhaps occa&s;ion &s;ome dreadful cata&s;trophe. "We are &s;eparated," cried &s;he, folding her hands to|gether, "forever &s;eparated in this world, but in hea|ven we &s;hall again be re-united."</P>
<P>Ab&s;orbed in the reflections and &s;orrow this letter gave ri&s;e to, &s;he remained in her &s;eat till Mrs. Macpher&s;on's little girl &s;uddenly appeared before her, and &s;aid her Mi&s;tre&s;s had made tea, and was wondering what kept her out &s;o long.</P>
<P>Amanda in&s;tantly aro&s;e and carefully putting up the letter returned to the hou&s;e where &s;he found Mrs. Mac|pher&s;on in a very bad humour. She grumbled exceed|ingly at Amanda's &s;taying out &s;o long, and taking no|tice of her eyes being red and &s;welled, &s;aid, "indeed, &s;he believed &s;he was right in &s;uppo&s;ing &s;he had got a love letter."</P>
<P>Amanda made no reply, and the evening pa&s;&s;ed away in peevi&s;hne&s;s on one &s;ide, and &s;ilence on the other.</P>
<P>The charm, which had hitherto rendered Amanda's &s;ituation tolerable, was now di&s;&s;olved, as Mrs. Dermot had &s;aid &s;he could write but &s;eldom, and &s;carcely ex|pected to have any thing intere&s;ting to relate; &s;he would gladly, therefore, have left Mrs. Macpher&s;on immediately, but &s;he knew not where to go to: She re&s;olved, however, ere winter was entirely &s;et in, to reque&s;t Mrs. Dermot to look out for &s;ome other place for her, as &s;he had connections in Scotland, &s;he thought &s;he might recommend her to them as a governe&s;s, or a fit per&s;on to do fine works for a lady.</P>
<P>She aro&s;e long before her u&s;ual hour the next morn|ing, and wrote a letter expre&s;&s;ive of her wi&s;hes and intentions to Mrs. Dermot, which &s;he &s;ent by a poor man who lived near the hou&s;e to the po&s;t town reward|ing him liberally for his trouble.</P>

<P>AMONG Mrs. Macpher&s;on's pupils were two little girls, who plea&s;ed and intere&s;ted Amanda greatly. Their father for whom they were in mourning, had peri&s;hed in a violent &s;torm, and their mother had pined in health and &s;pirits ever &s;ince the fatal accident. The kindne&s;s with which Amanda treated them, they repaid with gratitude and attention; it had a double ef|fect upon their little hearts, from being contra&s;ted with the four au&s;terity of Mrs. Macpher&s;on; they told Aman|da, in a whi&s;per, one morning that their mama was coming to &s;ee their dear, good Frances Donald.</P>
<P>Accordingly, in the cour&s;e of the day, Mrs Duncan came; &s;he was young and plea&s;ing in her appearance; her weeds and deep dejection rendered her a mo&s;t inter|e&s;ting object. She &s;at by Amanda, and took an oppor|tunity, while Mrs. Macpher&s;on was engaged with &s;ome of the children, to tell her in a low voice, "&s;he was truly obliged to her for the great attention and kindne&s;s &s;he &s;hewed her little girls, &s;o unlike their former treat|ment at the &s;chool. The ta&s;k of in&s;tructing them was her's," &s;he &s;aid, "till her declining health and &s;pirits rendered her no longer able to bear it." Amanda a&s;|&s;ured her, it was a plea&s;ure to in&s;truct minds &s;o docile and &s;weet tempered as theirs." Mrs. Duncan, as &s;he ro&s;e to depart, a&s;ked her and Mrs. Macpher&s;on to tea that evening, which invitation was in&s;tantly accepted by
<PB N="128" REF="038416_0528_1011E5EF07DF4628">
Mrs. Macpher&s;on, who was extremely fond of being &s;o|ciable every where but in her own hou&s;e. Mrs. Dun|can lived at but a little di&s;tance, and every thing in and about the hou&s;e was neat and comfortable. She had an old neighbour in the parlour, who kept Mrs. Macpher&s;on in chat, and gave her an opportunity of conver&s;ing freely with Amanda. She marked the delicacy of her looks, and &s;aid, "She believed &s;he was ill-qualified to endure &s;o fatiguing a life as her pre&s;ent." She mentioned her own lonely and melancholy life, and the happine&s;s &s;he would derive from having &s;uch a companion, and expre&s;|&s;ed her hopes of often enjoying her &s;ociety. Amanda &s;aid this would be impo&s;&s;ible without di&s;obliging Mrs. Macpher&s;on, and Mrs. Duncan on reflection allowed it would be &s;o. She then enquired if &s;he ever walked; Amanda replied &s;he did, and was a&s;ked where &s;he gene|rally rambled; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;ea &s;ide &s;he replied.</P>
<P>Mrs. Duncan &s;ighed deeply, and her eyes filled with tears: "It is there I generally ramble too," &s;aid &s;he. This led to the mention of her late lo&s;s: "Mr. Duncan had been the kinde&s;t, be&s;t of hu&s;bands," &s;he &s;aid; "the fir&s;t years of their marriage were attended with difficul|ties, which were ju&s;t removed, when he was lo&s;t on a party of plea&s;ure with &s;everal others. It was &s;ome con|&s;olation, however," continued Mrs. Duncan, "that the body was ca&s;t upon the &s;hore, and I had the power of paying the la&s;t rites of decency and re&s;pect to him.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, between her and Amanda there appeared a mutual &s;ympathy, which rendered them truly intere&s;t|ing to each other. From this period they met generally every evening, and pa&s;&s;ed many hours on the "&s;ea-beat &s;hore," talking and often weeping over "joys departed never to return!" Mrs. Duncan was too delicate to enquire into Amanda's former &s;ituation, but was well convinced it had been very different from her pre&s;ent one. Amanda, however, of her own accord, told her what &s;he had told Mrs. Macpher&s;on, re&s;pecting her&s;elf. Mrs. Duncan lamented her misfortunes, but &s;ince &s;he had met them, ble&s;&s;ed the happy chance which con|ducted her near her habitation.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="038416_0529_1011E5F1C59035A8">
A month pa&s;&s;ed in this manner, when one evening, at the u&s;ual place of meeting, Mrs. Duncan told her, "that &s;he believed &s;he &s;hould &s;oon be quitting that part of the country." Amanda &s;tarted, and turned pale at this di&s;agreeable intelligence. She had received no an|&s;wer to her letter from Mrs. Dermot, con&s;equently dreaded that nece&s;&s;ity would compel her to remain in her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and on Mrs. Duncan's &s;ociety &s;he had depended for rendering it bearable to her.</P>
<P>"I have been invited my dear girl, &s;aid Mrs. Dun|can, leaning on her arm as they walked up and down the beach, "to re&s;ide with an aunt, who has always been kind, and was particularly &s;o to me in my di&s;tre&s;s. She lives about ten miles from this, at an old place cal|led Dunreath Abbey, of which &s;he is hou&s;ekeeper; have you ever heard of it?"&mdash;Amanda's agitation, at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">earing her mother's native habitation mentioned, is not to be de&s;cribed; her heart palpitated; &s;he felt her colour change, and &s;aid, Yes, and No, to Mrs. Dun|can, without knowing what &s;he an&s;wered; then recol|lecting her&s;elf, &s;he replied, "&s;he had heard of it."</P>
<P>"Well then, my dear," continued Mrs. Duncan, "my aunt, as I have already told you, is hou&s;ekeeper there; &s;he lives in great grandeur, for it is a magni|ficent old &s;eat, and has the ab&s;olute command of every thing, as none of the family have re&s;ided at it &s;ince the Ear, of Dunreath's decea&s;e."</P>
<P>"My aunt is lately grown weary of the profound &s;o|litude in which &s;he lives, and has a&s;ked me in a letter which I received this morning, to go immediately and take up my re&s;idence with her, promi&s;ing, if I do &s;he will leave every thing &s;he is worth to me and my children, and as her &s;alary is very good, I know &s;he mu&s;t have &s;aved a good deal; this is a very tempting offer, and I am only with held from accepting it direct|ly by the fear of depriving my children of the advan|tages of education."</P>
<P>"Why," "&s;aid Amanda, "what they learn at Mrs. Macpher&s;on's they could ea&s;ily learn any where el&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="038416_0530_1011E5F354862298">
"But I intended, when they were a little older," replied Mrs. Duncan, "to go to &s;ome one of the neighbouring towns with them; if I once go to my aunt I mu&s;t entirely relinqui&s;h &s;uch an idea, and to a boarding-&s;chool I could not &s;end them, for I have not fortitude to bear a &s;eparation from them; what I wi&s;h therefore is, to procure a per&s;on who would be at once a plea&s;ing companion for me, and an elligible go|verne&s;s for them; with &s;uch a per&s;on the &s;olitude of Dunreath-Abbey would be rather agreeable than irk|&s;ome to me."</P>
<P>She looked earne&s;tly at Amanda as &s;he &s;poke, and Amanda's heart began to throb with hope and agitation. "In &s;hort my dear girl," continued &s;he, "you of all others, to be explicit, are the per&s;on I would chu&s;e to bring along with me; your &s;weet &s;ociety would alleviate my &s;orrows, and your elegant accompli&s;hments give to my children all the advantages I de&s;ire them to po&s;&s;e&s;s."</P>
<P>"I am not only flattered, but happy by your pre|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in my favour," replied Amanda.</P>
<P>"I am plea&s;ed we agree in point of inclination," &s;aid Mrs. Duncan; "but I mu&s;t now inform you that my aunt has always been aver&s;e to admit any &s;trangers to the Abbey: Why I know not, except it is by the commands of the family, and &s;he tells me in her letter, that if I accept her invitation I mu&s;t not on any account let it be known where I am removing to; I dare not therefore bring you with me without her permi&s;&s;ion; but I &s;hall write immediately, and reque&s;t it. In the cour&s;e of a day or two I may except an an&s;wer; in the mean time give Mrs. Macpher&s;on no intimation of our pre&s;ent intentions, le&s;t they &s;hould be defeated." A|manda promi&s;ed &s;he would not, and they &s;eparated.</P>
<P>She was now in a &s;tate of the greate&s;t agitation, at the probability there was that &s;he might vi&s;it the &s;eat of her ance&s;tors. She dreaded a di&s;appointment, and felt that&punc; if &s;he went there as the companion of Mrs. Dun|can, &s;he &s;hould be better &s;ituated than a few hours be|fore &s;he had ever expected to be again. Two evenings

after her conver&s;ation with Mrs. Duncan, on going to the beach to meet her, &s;he &s;aw her approaching with an open letter in her hand, and a &s;mile on her face, which informed her its contents were plea&s;ing. They were &s;o indeed, as they gave permi&s;&s;ion to have Amanda brought to the Abbey, provided &s;he promi&s;ed inviolable &s;ecrecy as to where &s;he was going. This Amanda cheer|fully did, and Mrs. Duncan &s;aid, &s;he had &s;ome affairs to &s;ettle, which would prevent their departure for a few days; at whatever time &s;he appointed, her aunt was to &s;end a carriage for them, and it was now agreed, that Mrs. Macpher&s;on &s;hould be informed Mrs. Duncan was leaving that part of the country, and had engaged A|manda as a governe&s;s to her children.</P>
<P>Mrs. Duncan then mentioned her own terms. Aman|da a&s;&s;ured her an idea of them had never entered her thoughts. Mrs. Duncan &s;aid &s;he was &s;ure of that, but at the &s;ame time thought between the mo&s;t intimate friends exactne&s;s &s;hould be pre&s;erved. Every thing being &s;ettled to their mutual &s;atisfaction they &s;eparated, and the follow|ing day, after &s;chool broke up, Amanda informed Mrs. Macpher&s;on of her intended departure. The old Dame was thunder-&s;truck, and for &s;ome time unable to &s;peak, but when &s;he recovered the u&s;e of her tongue expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t rage and indignation again&s;t Amanda, Mrs. Duncan, and the Priore&s;s, again&s;t the fir&s;t for thinking of leaving her, the &s;econd for inveigling her away, and the third for recommending a per&s;on who could &s;erve her in &s;uch a manner. When &s;he &s;topped exhau&s;ted by her violence, Amanda took the opportunity of a&s;&s;uring her that &s;he had no rea&s;on to condemn any of them, as for her part, previous to Mrs. Duncan's offer, &s;he in|tended to leave her, being unable to bear a life of &s;uch fatigue; that, as her removal would not be immediate, Mrs. Macpher&s;on could &s;uffer no inconvenience by it, there being time enough to look out for another per&s;on ere it took place: But the truth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> broke from Mrs. Macpher&s;on, angry as &s;he was with Amanda, &s;he could not help confe&s;&s;ing, that &s;he never again expected to meet with a per&s;on &s;o well qualified to plea&s;e her, and a

torrent of bitter reproaches again bur&s;t forth for her quitting her.</P>
<P>Amanda re&s;ented them not, but did all in her power to molify her; as the mo&s;t effectual method of doing &s;o &s;he declared &s;he meant to take no recompen&s;e for the time &s;he had been with her, and added, if &s;he had her permi&s;&s;ion, &s;he would write that very evening to Mrs. Dermot about a woman &s;he had &s;een at the Convent, who &s;he thought well qualified to be an a&s;&s;i&s;tant in her &s;chool. This was the woman who had been engaged to attend her to England. Mrs. Macpher&s;on at la&s;t con|&s;ented &s;he &s;hould write for her, as her wrath had gra|dually &s;ub&s;ided from the moment Amanda declared &s;he would take no payment&mdash;Amanda accordingly wrote to Mrs. Dermot, and informed her of the agreeable change there was about taking place in her &s;ituation; al&s;o of Mrs. Macpher&s;on's di&s;plea&s;ure, and her own wi&s;h that a per&s;on might immediately be procured to fill the place &s;he was re&s;igning. She mentioned the woman already &s;poken of as a proper per&s;on, but reque&s;ted, if &s;he con&s;ented to come, &s;he might not be allowed to do &s;o till &s;he had left Mrs. Macpher&s;on's, el&s;e who &s;he really was would be betrayed; &s;he now thought little of the tedious and di&s;agreeable days &s;he &s;pent, as the eager|ne&s;s with which &s;he &s;aw Mrs. Duncan preparing for their departure promi&s;ed &s;o &s;peedily to change them; &s;he re|ceived an an&s;wer from Ireland even &s;ooner than &s;he ex|pected. Mrs. Dermot congratulated her on having met &s;o amiable a friend, as Mrs. Duncan; &s;aid the woman accepted the offer made in Mrs. Macpher&s;on's name; but &s;hould not depart till &s;he had written for that purpo&s;e, and concluded her letter by &s;aying, there was no intelli|gence yet of Lord Mortimer. Mrs. Macpher&s;on was plea&s;ed to find &s;he &s;hould not be long without a compani|on, and two days after the receipt of the letter, Mrs. Duncan told Amanda their journey was fixed for the en|&s;uing day, and begged Amanda to &s;leep at her hou&s;e that night, to which &s;he gladly con&s;ented; accordingly after dinner &s;he took leave of Mrs. Macpher&s;on, who grumbled out a farewell, and a hope that &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight not
<PB N="133" REF="038416_0533_1011E5FCA9DF5C40">
have rea&s;on to repent quitting her, for the old lady was &s;o incen&s;ed to have the place Mrs. Duncan was going to, concealed from her, that all her ill humour had re|turned. Amanda, with a plea&s;ure &s;he could &s;carcely conceal, quitted her inho&s;pitable man&s;ion, and atten|ded by a man who carried her trunk, &s;oon found her&s;elf at Mrs. Duncan's where &s;he was received with every demon&s;tration of joy. The evening pa&s;&s;ed &s;ociably away; they aro&s;e early in the morning, and had ju&s;t breakfa&s;ted when the expected carriage from Dunreath Abbey arrived; it was a heavy old-fa&s;hioned chai&s;e, on who&s;e faded pannels the arms of the Dunreath family were &s;till vi&s;ible.&mdash;Mrs. Duncan's luggage had been &s;ent off the preceding day, &s;o that there was nothing now to delay them. Mrs. Duncan made Amanda and the children go into the chai&s;e before her, but detained by an emotion of the mo&s;t painful nature, &s;he lingered &s;ome time upon the thre&s;hold; &s;he could not indeed de|part from the habitation, where &s;he had pa&s;t &s;o many happy days with the man of her tendere&s;t affections, without a flood of tears, which &s;poke the bitterne&s;s of her feelings. Amanda knew too well the nature of tho&s;e feelings, to attempt re&s;training them; but the little children impatient to begin their journey, called out to their mamma to come into the carriage. She &s;tarted when they &s;poke, but in&s;tantly complied with their de|&s;ire; and when they expre&s;&s;ed their grief at &s;eeing her cheeks wet with tears, ki&s;&s;ed them both, and &s;aid &s;he would &s;oon recover her &s;pirits. She accordingly exerted her&s;elf for that purpo&s;e, and was &s;oon in a condition to conver&s;e with Amanda. The day was fine and &s;erene; they travelled lei&s;urely, for the hor&s;es had long outlived their mettle&s;ome days, and gave them an opportunity of attentively viewing the pro&s;pects on each &s;ide, which were various, romantic and beautiful; the novelty of the &s;cenes, the di&s;agreeable place &s;he had left, and the idea of the one &s;he was going to, helped a little to en|liven the pen&s;ive &s;oul of Amanda, and &s;he enjoyed a greater degree of tranquillity than &s;he had before expe|rienced &s;ince her &s;eparation from Lord Mortimer.</P>

<P>"MY dear, dear Fanny," &s;aid Mrs. Duncan, addre&s;&s;ing our heroine by her borrowed name, "if at all inclined to &s;uper&s;tition, you are now going to a place which will call it forth. Dunreath-Abbey is Goth|ic and gloomy in the extreme, and recalls to one's mind all the &s;tories they ever heard of haunted hou&s;es and apparitions; the de&s;ertion of the native inhabitants has ha&s;tened the depredations of time, who&s;e ravages are unrepaired, except in the part immediately occupied by the dome&s;tics; yet what is the change of the building compared to the revolution which took place in the fortunes of her who once beheld a pro&s;pect of being its mi&s;tre&s;s; the Earl of Dunreath's elde&s;t daughter, as I have often heard from many, was a celebrated beauty, and as good as &s;he was hand&s;ome; but a malignant &s;tep|mother thwarted her happine&s;s, and forced her to take &s;helter in the arms of a man who had every thing but fortune to recommend him; but in wanting that he wanted every thing to plea&s;e her family.</P>
<P>"After &s;ome years of di&s;tre&s;s &s;he found means to &s;of|ten the heart of her father; but here the invidious &s;tep|mother again interfered, and prevented her experiencing any good effects from his returning tenderne&s;s, and it was rumoured, by a deep and iniquitous &s;cheme, depri|ved her of her birth-right. Like other rumours, howe|ver it gradually died away, perhaps from Lady Malvi|na and her hu&s;band never hearing of it, and none but them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight to enquire into its truth&punc; but if &s;uch a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> was really contrived, woe be to its fabricator:

the pride and pomp of wealth can neither alleviate or recompen&s;e the &s;tings of con&s;cience, much rather," continued Mrs. Duncan, laying her hands on her chil|dren's heads as they &s;at at her feet, "much rather would I have my babes wander from door to door, to beg the dole of charity than live upon the birth right of the orphan.</P>
<P>"If Lady Dunreath in reality committed the crime &s;he was accu&s;ed of, &s;he met, in &s;ome degree a puni&s;h|ment for it. Soon after the Earl's death &s;he betrayed a partiality, for a man every way inferior to her, which partiality, people have not &s;crupled to &s;ay, commenced, and was indulged to a criminal degree during the life|time of her hu&s;band. She would have married him had not her daughter, the Marchione&s;s of Ro&s;line, interfer|ed. Proud and ambitious, her rage at the pro&s;pect of &s;uch an alliance knew no bounds, and &s;econded by the Marquis, who&s;e di&s;po&s;ition was congenial to her own, they got the unfortunate mother into their power, and hurried her off to a convent in France. I know not whe|ther &s;he is yet living; indeed I believe there are few ei|ther know or care, &s;he was &s;o much di&s;liked for her haughty di&s;po&s;ition. I have &s;ometimes a&s;ked my aunt about her, but &s;he would never gratify my curio&s;ity. She has been brought up in the family; and no doubt thinks her&s;elf bound to conceal whatever they chu&s;e.</P>
<P>"She lives in ea&s;e and plenty, and is ab&s;olute mi&s;|tre&s;s of the few dome&s;tics that re&s;ide in the Abbey; but of tho&s;e dome&s;tics I caution you in time, or they will be apt to fill your head with frightful &s;tories of the Abbey, which &s;ometimes, if one's &s;pirits are weak, in &s;pite of rea&s;on, will make an impre&s;&s;ion on the mind. They pretend that the Earl of Dunreath's fir&s;t wife haunts the Abbey, venting the mo&s;t piteous moans, which they a&s;cribe to grief for the unfortunate fate of her daughter, and that daughter's children being de|prived of their rightful patrimony.</P>
<P>"I hone&s;tly confe&s;s, when at the Abbey a few years ago, during &s;ome di&s;tre&s;&s;es of my hu&s;band's, I heard &s;trange noi&s;es one evening at twilight as I walked in a
<PB N="136" REF="038416_0536_1011E604346DAD38">
gallery. I told my aunt of them, and &s;he was quite angry at the involuntary terror I expre&s;&s;ed, and &s;aid it was nothing but the wind whi&s;tling through &s;ome ad|joining galleries which I heard. But this, my dear Fanny," &s;aid Mrs. Duncan, who on account of her children had continued the latter part of her di&s;cour&s;e, in a low voice, "is all between our&s;elves; for my aunt declared &s;he would never pardon my mentioning my ri|diculous fears, or the yet more ridiculous fears of the &s;ervants to any human being."</P>
<P>Amanda li&s;tened in &s;ilence to Mrs. Duncan's di&s;|cour&s;e, fearful that if &s;he &s;poke &s;he &s;hould betray the emotions it excited.</P>
<P>They at la&s;t entered between the mountains that en|clo&s;ed the valley on which the Abbey &s;tood. The &s;cene was &s;olemn and &s;olitary; every pro&s;pect, except one of the &s;ea, &s;een through an aperture in one of the moun|tains was excluded. Some of the&s;e mountains were bare, craggy, and projecting; others were &s;kirted with trees, robed with vivid green, and crowned with white and yellow furze; &s;ome were all a wood of interming|led &s;hades, and others covered with long and purple heath, various &s;treams flowed from them into the valley, &s;ome &s;tole gently down their &s;ides in &s;ilver rills, giving beauty and vigour wherever they meandered, others <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">mbled from fragment to fragment, with a noi&s;e not undelightful to the ear, and formed for them&s;elves a deep bed in the valley, over which trees, that appeared coeval with the bulding, bent their old and leafy heads.</P>
<P>At the foot of what to the re&s;t was called a gently &s;welling hill, lay the remains of the exten&s;ive gardens which had once given the luxuries of the vegetable world to the banquets of the Abbey; but the buildings which had nur&s;ed tho&s;e luxuries were all gone to decay, and the gay plantations were over run with the progeny of neglect and &s;loth.</P>
<P>The Abbey was one of the mo&s;t venerable looking buildings Amanda had ever beheld; but it was in me|lancholy grandeur &s;he now &s;aw it. In the wane of its days, when its glory was pa&s;&s;ed away, and the whole
<PB N="137" REF="038416_0537_1011E6070EF9D108">
pile proclaimed de&s;ertion and decay, &s;he &s;aw it, when to u&s;e the beautiful language of Hutchin&s;on, its pride was brought low, when its magnificence was &s;inking in the du&s;t, when tribulation had taken the &s;eat of ho&s;pi|tality, and &s;olitude reigned, where once the jocund gue&s;t had laughed over the &s;parkling bowl, whil&s;t the owls &s;ung nightly their &s;trains of melancholy to the moon &s;hine that &s;lept upon its mouldering battlements.</P>
<P>The heart of Amanda was full of the fond idea of her parents, and the &s;igh of tender remembrance &s;tole from it. "How little room," thought &s;he, "&s;hould there be in the human heart for the wordly pride which &s;o often dilates it, liable as all things are to change, the di&s;tre&s;s in which the de&s;cendants of noble families are &s;o often &s;een, the decline of &s;uch families them&s;elves &s;hould check that arrogant pre&s;umption with which &s;o many look forward to having their greatne&s;s and pro&s;|perity perpetuated through every branch of their po&s;|terity.</P>
<P>"The proud po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of this Abbey, &s;urrounded with affluence, and living in its full enjoyment, never perhaps admitted the idea as at all probable, that one of their de&s;cendants &s;hould ever approach the &s;eat of her ance&s;tors without that pomp and elegance which hereto|fore di&s;tingui&s;hed its daughters. Alas! one now ap|proaches it neither to di&s;play or contemplate the pa|geantry of wealth, but meek and lowly; not to re|ceive the &s;mile of love, or the embrace of relatives, but afflicted and unknown, glad to find a &s;helter, and pro|cure the bread of dependence beneath its decaying roof.</P>
<P>Mrs. Duncan happily marked not Amanda's emo|tion as &s;he gazed upon the Abbey; &s;he was bu&s;ily em|ployed in an&s;wering her childrens' que&s;tions, who wanted to know whether &s;he thought they would be able to climb up the great big hills they &s;aw.</P>
<P>The carriage at la&s;t &s;topped before the Abbey. Mrs. Bruce was already at the door to receive them; &s;he was a little &s;mart old woman, and welcomed her niece and the children with an appearance of the greate&s;t plea|&s;ure.
<PB N="138" REF="038416_0538_1011E608DFC23FC0">
On Amanda's being pre&s;ented to her, &s;he gazed &s;tedfa&s;tly in her face a few minutes, and then exclaim|ed, "Well, this is very &s;trange&mdash;though I know I could never have &s;een this young lady before, her face is quite familiar to me."</P>
<P>The hall into which they entered was large and gloo|my, paved with black marble, and &s;upported by pil|lars, through which the arched doors that led to va|rious apartments were &s;een; rude implements, &s;uch as the Caledonians, had formerly u&s;ed in war and hunting, were ranged along the walls. Mrs. Bruce conducted them into a &s;pacious parlour, terminated by an elegant &s;aloon; this &s;he told them had once been the banquet|ing-room; the furniture, though faded, was &s;till mag|nificent, and the windows, though &s;till in the Gothic &s;tyle, from being enlarged con&s;iderably beyond their original dimen&s;ions, afforded a mo&s;t delightful view of the domain.</P>
<P>"Do you know &s;aid Mrs. Duncan, "this apart|ment, though one of the plea&s;ante&s;t in the Abbey in point of &s;ituation, always makes me melancholy; the moment I enter it I think of the entertainments once given in it, and then its pre&s;ent vacancy and &s;tillne&s;s almo&s;t in&s;tantly reminds me, that tho&s;e who partook of the&s;e entertainments are now almo&s;t all humbled with the du&s;t?"&mdash;Her aunt laughed, and &s;aid, "&s;he was very romantic."</P>
<P>The &s;olemnity of the Abbey was well calculated to heighten the awe which &s;tole upon the &s;pirit of Amanda from her fir&s;t view of it; no noi&s;e was heard through|out, except the hoar&s;e creaking of the ma&s;&s;y doors, as the &s;ervants pa&s;&s;ed from one room to another adju&s;ting Mrs. Duncan's things and preparing for dinner. Mrs. Duncan was drawn into a corner of the room by her aunt, to conver&s;e, in a low voice, about family affairs, and the children were rambling about the hall, wonder|ing and enquiring about every thing they &s;aw.</P>
<P>Thus left to her&s;elf, a &s;oft languor gradually &s;tole over the mind of Amanda, which was almo&s;t exhau&s;ted from the emotions it had experienced. The murmur|ing &s;ound of waterfalls and the buzzing of the flies,
<PB N="139" REF="038416_0539_1011E60CAF598178">
that ba&s;ked in the &s;unny rays which darted through the ca&s;ements, lulled her into a kind of pen&s;ive tranquillity.</P>
<P>"Am I really," &s;he a&s;ked her&s;elf, "in the &s;eat of my ance&s;tors? Am I really in the habitation where my mo|ther was born, where her irrevocable vows were plighted to my father? I am&mdash;and, oh! within it may I at la&s;t find an a&s;ylum from the vices and dangers of the world; within it may my &s;orrowing &s;pirit lo&s;e its agitation, and &s;ubdue, if not its affections, at lea&s;t its murmurs, at the di&s;appointment of tho&s;e affections."</P>
<P>The appearance of dinner interrupted her. She made exertions to overcome any appearance of dejection, and the conver&s;ation, if not lively, was at lea&s;t cheerful. After dinner Mrs. Duncan, who had been informed by Amanda of her predilection for old buildings, a&s;ked her aunt's permi&s;&s;ion to &s;hew her the Abbey. Mrs. Bruce immediately aro&s;e, and &s;aid &s;he would have that plea&s;ure her&s;elf. She accordingly led the way; many of the apartments yet di&s;played the &s;umptuous ta&s;te of tho&s;e who had furni&s;hed them. "It is a&s;toni&s;hing to me," &s;aid Mrs. Duncan, "that &s;o magnificent a pile as this &s;hould be abandoned, as I may &s;ay, by its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors."</P>
<P>"The Marquis of Ro&s;line's Ca&s;tle is a more mod|ern &s;tructure than this," &s;aid Mrs. Bruce, "and pre|ferred by them on that account."</P>
<P>"So, like the family monument," rejoined Mrs. Dun|can, "they are merely &s;atisfied with permitting this to &s;tand, as it may help to tran&s;mit the Marchione&s;s's name to po&s;terity."</P>
<P>"How far does the Marquis live from this?" a&s;ked Amanda.</P>
<P>"About twelve miles," replied Mrs. Bruce, who did not appear plea&s;ed with her niece's conver&s;ation, and led the way to a long gallery, ornamented with portraits of the family. This gallery Amanda knew well by de&s;cription; this was the gallery in which her father had &s;topped to contemplate the picture of her mother, and her heart throbbed with impatience and anxiety to &s;ee that picture.</P>
<P>Mrs. Bruce, as &s;he went before her, told her the
<PB N="140" REF="038416_0540_1011E610818C54F0">
names of the different portraits. She &s;uddenly &s;topped before one;&mdash;"that," cried &s;he, "is the Marchione&s;s of Ro&s;line's drawn for her when Lady Augu&s;ta Dun|reath." Amanda ca&s;t her eyes upon it, and perceived in the countenance the &s;ame haughtine&s;s as &s;till di&s;tingui&s;h|ed the Marchione&s;s. She looked at the next pannel, and found it empty.</P>
<P>"The picture of Lady Malvina Dunreath hung there," &s;aid Mrs. Bruce; "but after her unfortunate marriage it was taken down."</P>
<P>"And de&s;troyed," exclaimed Amanda mournfully.</P>
<P>"No; but it was thrown into the old Chapel, where with the re&s;t of the lumber (the &s;oul of Amanda was &s;truck at the&s;e words)&mdash;it has been locked up for years."</P>
<P>"And is it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ee it?" a&s;ked Amanda.</P>
<P>"Impo&s;&s;ible indeed," replied Mrs. Bruce, "the Chapel, and the whole ea&s;tern part of the Abbey, have long been in a ruinous &s;ituation, on which account it has been locked up."</P>
<P>"This is the gallery," whi&s;pered Mrs. Duncan, "in which I heard the &s;trange noi&s;es; but not a word of them to my aunt."</P>
<P>Amanda could &s;carcely conceal the di&s;appointment &s;he felt at finding &s;he could not &s;ee her mother's picture. She would have entreated the chapel might be opened for that purpo&s;e, had &s;he not feared exciting &s;u&s;picions by doing &s;o.</P>
<P>They returned from the gallery to the parlour, and in the cour&s;e of conver&s;ation Amanda heard many in|tere&s;ting anecdotes of her ance&s;tors from Mrs. Bruce. Her mother was al&s;o mentioned, and Mrs. Bruce, by dwelling on her worth, made amends in &s;ome degree, to Amanda for having called her picture lumber. She retired to her chamber with her mind &s;oftened and ele|vated by hearing of her mother's virtues. She called upon her, upon her father's &s;pirit, upon them who&s;e kindred &s;ouls were re-united in heaven, to ble&s;s their child, to &s;trengthen, to &s;upport her in the thorny path marked out for her to take; nor to cea&s;e their tutelary care till &s;he was joined to them by Providence.</P>

<P>EXPERIENCE convinced Amanda that the change in her &s;ituation was, if po&s;&s;ible, more plea&s;ing than &s;he expected it would be. Mrs. Duncan was the kinde&s;t and mo&s;t attentive of friends. Mrs. Bruce was civil and obliging, and her little pupils were docile and affectionate. Could &s;he have avoided retro&s;pection, &s;he would have been happy; but the remembrance of pa&s;t events was too deeply impre&s;&s;ed upon her mind to be era|&s;ed; it mingled in the vi&s;ions of the night, in the avo|cations of the day, and in the meditations of her lonely hours, forcing from her heart the &s;ighs of regret and ten|derne&s;s; her mornings were devoted to her pupils, and in the evenings &s;he &s;ometimes walked with Mrs. Duncan, &s;ometimes read aloud whil&s;t &s;he and her aunt were work|ing; but whenever they were engaged in chatting about family affairs, or at a game of piquet, (which was often the ca&s;e, as Mrs. Bruce neither loved walking or work|ing) &s;he always took that opportunity of retiring from the room, and either rambled through the dark and in|tricate windings of the Abbey, or about the grounds contiguous to it; &s;he &s;ighed whenever &s;he pa&s;&s;ed the Chapel which contained the picture of her mother; it was in a ruinous condition; but a thick foliage of ivy partly hid, while it proclaimed its decey; the windows were broken in many places, but all too high to admit the po&s;&s;ibility of her gaining admittance thro' them, and the door was &s;trongly &s;ecured by ma&s;&s;y bars of iron, as was every door which had a communication with the ea&s;tern
<PB N="142" REF="038416_0542_1011E614C4128AA0">
part of the Abbey. A fortnight pa&s;&s;ed away at the Abbey without any thing happening to di&s;turb the tran|quillity which reigned in it. No one approached it, ex|cept a few of the wandering children of poverty, and its inhabitants &s;eemed perfectly content with their &s;e|clu&s;ion from the world. Amanda, by Mrs. Duncan's de|&s;ire, had told Mrs. Dermot to direct her letters to a town about five miles from the Abbey; thither a man went every day, but con&s;tantly returned without one for her.</P>
<P>"Why," &s;he a&s;ked her&s;elf, "this anxiety for a let|ter, this di&s;appointment for not receiving one, when I neither expect to hear any thing intere&s;ting or agreea|able? Mrs. Dermot has already &s;aid &s;he had no means of hearing about Lord Mortimer, and, even if &s;he had, why &s;hould I de&s;ire &s;uch intelligence, torn as I am from him forever?"</P>
<P>At the expiration of another week an incident hap|pened, which again de&s;troyed the compo&s;ure of our he|roine. Mrs. Bruce one morning ha&s;tily entered the room, where &s;he and Mrs. Duncan were &s;itting with the little girls, and begged they would not &s;tir from it till &s;he told them to do &s;o, as the Marquis of Ro&s;line's &s;teward was below &s;tairs, and if he knew of their re&s;idence at the Abbey, &s;he was confident he would reveal it to his Lord, which &s;he had no doubt would occa&s;ion her own di&s;mi&s;|&s;ion from it. The ladies a&s;&s;ured her they would not leave the apartment, and &s;he retired, leaving them a&s;to|ni&s;hed at the agitation &s;he betrayed.</P>
<P>In about two hours &s;he returned, and &s;aid &s;he came to relea&s;e them from confinement as the &s;teward had de|parted. "He had brought unexpected intelligence," &s;aid &s;he; "the Marquis and his family are coming down to the ca&s;tle; the &s;ea&s;on is &s;o far advanced I did not &s;uppo&s;e they would vi&s;it it till next &s;ummer: I mu&s;t therefore," continued &s;he, addre&s;&s;ing her niece, &s;end to the neighbouring town to procure lodgings for you till the family leave the country, as no doubt &s;ome of them will come to the Abbey, and to find you in it would, I can a&s;&s;ure you, be attended with unplea&s;ant con&s;equen|ces to me."</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="038416_0543_1011E61808955788">
Mrs. Duncan begged &s;he would not &s;uffer the lea&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s on her account, and propo&s;ed that very day leaving the Abbey.</P>
<P>"No," Mrs. Bruce replied, "there was no nece&s;|&s;ity, for quitting it for a few days longer, the family," continued &s;he, "are coming down upon a joyful oc|ca&s;ion, to celebrate the nuptials of the Marquis's daugh|ter, Lady Euphra&s;ia Sutherland."</P>
<P>"Lady Euphra&s;ia's nuptials!&punc; Exclaimed Amanda, in an agitated voice, and forgetting her own &s;ituation, "To whom is &s;he going to be married?"</P>
<P>"To Lord Mortimer," Mrs. Bruce replied, "the Earl of Cherbury's only &s;on, a very fine young man. I am told the affair has been long talked of; but&mdash;." Here &s;he was interrupted by a deep &s;igh, or rather groan from the unfortunate Amanda, who at the &s;ame moment fell back on her chair, pale, and without motion. Mrs. Duncan &s;creamed, and flew to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, Mrs. Bruce equally frightened, though le&s;s affected, ran for re&s;to|ratives, and the children cla&s;ped her knees and wept. From her pen&s;ive look and manner Mrs. Duncan &s;u&s;pect|ed, from their fir&s;t acquaintance, that her heart had ex|perienced a di&s;appointment of the tendere&s;t nature. Her little girls too had told her that they had &s;een Mi&s;s Do|nald crying over a picture. Her &s;u&s;picions concerning &s;uch a di&s;appointment were now confirmed by a &s;udden emotion and illne&s;s of Amanda; but &s;he had all the de|licacy which belongs to true &s;en&s;ibility, and determined never to let Amanda know &s;he conjectured the &s;ource of her &s;orrows, certain as &s;he was that they had never ori|ginated from any mi&s;conduct.</P>
<P>Mrs. Bruce's drops re&s;tored Amanda's &s;en&s;es; but &s;he felt weak and trembling, and begged &s;he might be &s;upported to her room to lie down on the bed. Mrs. Bruce and Mrs. Duncan accordingly led her to it. The former almo&s;t immediately retired, and the tears of Amanda now bur&s;t forth. She wept a long time with|out intermi&s;&s;ion, and as &s;oon as her &s;obs would permit her to &s;peak, begged Mrs. Duncan to leave her to her|&s;elf. Mrs. Duncan knew too well the luxury of &s;ecret
<PB N="144" REF="038416_0544_1011E61C2BAE53C8">
grief to deny her the enjoyment of &s;o melancholy a fea&s;t, and directly withdrew.</P>
<P>The wretched Amanda then a&s;ked her&s;elf, if &s;he had not known before, that the &s;acrifice &s;he had made Lord Cherbury would lead to the event &s;he now regretted? It was true &s;he did know it; but whenever an idea of its taking place occurred, &s;he had &s;o &s;edulou&s;ly driven it from her mind, that &s;he at la&s;t almo&s;t cea&s;ed to think about it; was he to be united to any other woman than Lady Euphra&s;ia, &s;he thought &s;he would not be &s;o wret|ched. "Oh, Mortimer! beloved of my &s;oul!" &s;he cri|ed, "were you going to be united to a woman &s;en&s;ible of your worth, and worthy of your noble heart, in the knowledge of your happine&s;s my mi&s;ery would be le&s;|&s;ened; but what an union of mi&s;ery mu&s;t minds &s;o un|congenial as your's and Lady Euphra&s;ia's form! Alas! am I not wretched enough in contemplating my own pro&s;pect of unhappine&s;s, but that your's al&s;o mu&s;t be obtruded on me."</P>
<P>"Yet, perhaps," &s;he continued, "the evils I dread on Lord Mortimer's account may be averted.&mdash;Oh! that they may, "&s;aid &s;he, with fervor, and rai&s;ing her hands and eyes. "Soften, gracious Heaven! &s;often the flinty nature of Lady Euphra&s;ia: Oh! render her &s;en&s;ible of the ble&s;&s;ing you be&s;tow, in giving her Lord Mortimer, and render her not only capable of in&s;pir|ing, but of feeling tenderne&s;s. May &s;he prove to him the tender friend, the faithful, the affectionate compa|nion, the unfortunate Amanda would have been. Oh! may &s;he build her happine&s;s on his, and may his be great as his virtues, exten&s;ive as his charities, and may the knowledge of it &s;oothe my afflicted heart."</P>
<P>Her &s;pirits were a little elevated by the fervency of her language; but it was a tra&s;ient elevation; the flu&s;h it &s;pread over her cheeks &s;oon died away, and her tears again began to flow.</P>
<P>"Alas!" &s;he cried, "in a few days, it will be crimi|nal to think of Lord Mortimer as I have hitherto done and I &s;hall blu&s;h," continued &s;he, gazing at his picture,
<PB N="145" REF="038416_0545_1011E61ECC8D8BF8">
"to contemplate this dear &s;hadow, when I reflect its original is the hu&s;band of Lady Euphra&s;ia."</P>
<P>The dinner-bell now &s;ounded through the Abbey, and almo&s;t at the &s;ame time &s;he heard a tap at her door. She &s;tarted, and reflected for the fir&s;t time, that her deep dejection would naturally excite &s;u&s;picions as to its &s;ource, if longer indulged.&mdash;Shocked at the idea of in|curring them, &s;he ha&s;tily wiped away her tears, and opening the door, found her friend Mrs. Duncan at it, who begged &s;he would come down to dinner. Amanda did not refu&s;e, but was obliged to u&s;e the &s;upporting arm of her friend to reach the parlour. She could not eat; with difficulty could &s;he re&s;train her tears, or an|&s;wer the enquiries Mrs. Bruce made after what &s;he &s;up|po&s;ed a mere bodily indi&s;po&s;ition. She forced her&s;elf, however, to continue in the parlour till after tea, when cards being produced &s;he had an opportunity of going out and indulging her angui&s;h without fear of interruption: Unable, however, to walk far, &s;he repaired to the old Chapel, and &s;itting down by it leaned her head again&s;t its decayed and ivy covered walls. She had &s;carcely &s;at in this manner a minute when the &s;tones gave way, with a noi&s;e that terrified her, and &s;he would have fal|len backwards, had &s;he not caught at &s;ome projecting wood. She ha&s;tily ro&s;e, and found that the ivy entire|ly concealed the breach. She examined it however, and perceived it large enough to admit her into the Cha|pel. A &s;udden plea&s;ure pervaded her heart at the idea of being able to enter it, and examine the picture &s;he had &s;o long wi&s;hed to behold. There was nothing to oppo&s;e her entrance but the ivy. This &s;he parted with difficul|ty, but &s;o as not to &s;trip it from the wall, and after &s;tep|ping over the fallen rubbi&s;h, &s;he found her&s;elf in the body of the Chapel. The &s;ilent hour of twilight was now advanced&punc; but the moon be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ms that darted through the broken roof prevented the Chapel from being involved in utter darkne&s;s. Already had the owls begun their me|lancholy &s;trains on its mouldering pillars, while the ra|vens croaked among&s;t the luxuriant trees that ru&s;tled
<PB N="146" REF="038416_0546_1011E620B5DD9CA0">
around it, du&s;ty and moth-eaten banners were &s;u&s;pended from the walls, and ru&s;ty ca&s;ques, &s;hields and &s;pears were promi&s;cuou&s;ly heaped together, the u&s;ele&s;s armour of tho&s;e, over who&s;e remains Amanda now trod with a light and trembling foot; &s;he looked for the picture, and perceived one reclined again&s;t the wall near the altar. She wiped away the du&s;t, and perceived this was indeed the one &s;he &s;ought, the one her father had &s;o often de&s;|cribed to her, the light was too imperfect for her to di&s;|tingui&s;h the features, and &s;he re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to come at an earlier hour the en&s;uing evening. She felt impre&s;&s;ed with reverential awe as &s;he &s;tood before it. She recollected the pathetic manner in which her father had mentioned his emotions as he gazed upon it, and her tears began to flow for the di&s;a&s;trous fate of her parents and her own. She &s;unk into an agony of grief, which mournful remembrances and pre&s;ent calamities excited, upon the &s;teps of that altar, where Fitzalan and Malvi|na had plighted their irrevocable vows, &s;he leaned her arm on the rails, but her face was turned to the picture, as if it could &s;ee and would pity her di&s;tre&s;s. She re|mained in this &s;ituation till the &s;triking of the Abbey clock warned her to depart. In going towards the en|trance &s;he perceived a &s;mall arched door at the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, as the apartments Lady Malvina had occupied were in this part of the building, &s;he re&s;olved on vi&s;it|ing them before &s;he left the Abbey, le&s;t the breach in the wall &s;hould be di&s;covered ere &s;he returned to it. She returned to the parlour ere the ladies had fini&s;hed their game of piquet, and the next evening immediately af|ter tea, repaired to the Chapel leaving them as u&s;ual en|gaged at cards. She &s;tood a few minutes before it to &s;ee if any one was near; but perceiving no object &s;he again entered it.&mdash;She had now &s;ufficient light to exa|mine the picture; though faded by the damp, it yet re|tained that loveline&s;s for which its original was &s;o much admired, and which Amanda had &s;o often heard elo|quently de&s;cribed by her father. She contemplated it with awe and pity. Her heart &s;welled with the emo|tions it excited, and gave way to its feelings in tears.
<PB N="147" REF="038416_0547_1011E62386FE5C08">
To weep before the &s;hade of her mother, &s;eemed to a&s;|&s;uage the bitterne&s;s of tho&s;e feelings; &s;he pronounced the name of her parents, &s;he called her&s;elf their wretch|ed orphan, a &s;tranger, and a dependant, in the man&s;ion of her ance&s;tors; &s;he pronounced the name of Lord Mortimer in the impa&s;&s;ioned accents of tenderne&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s. As &s;he thus indulged the &s;orrows of her &s;oul in tears and lamentations, &s;he &s;uddenly heard a faint noi&s;e like an advancing foot&s;tep near her. She &s;tarted up, for &s;he had been kneeling before her mother's pic|ture, terrified lea&s;t her vi&s;it to the Chapel had been di&s;|covered, which &s;he knew, if the ca&s;e, would mortally di&s;oblige Mrs. Bruce, though why &s;he &s;hould be &s;o aver&s;e to any one's vi&s;iting it &s;he could not conceive. She li&s;tened in trembling anxiety a few minutes; all again was &s;till, and &s;he returned to the parlour, where &s;he found the ladies as &s;he had left them, determined, notwith&s;tanding her late fright, to return the next even|ing to the Chapel, and vi&s;it the apartments that were her mother's.</P>

<P>THE next evening Amanda's patience was put to the te&s;t; for after tea Mrs. Duncan propo&s;ed a walk, which &s;eemed to cut off her hopes of vi&s;iting the chapel that evening; but after &s;trolling &s;ome time about the valley, complai&s;ance for her aunt made Mrs. Dun|can return to the parlour, where &s;he was expected to take her u&s;ual hand at piquet.

all this Amanda re&s;olved on going to the chapel con&s;i|dering this as, in all probability, the only opportunity &s;he would have of vi&s;iting the apartments her mother had occupied (which &s;he had an inexpre&s;&s;ible de&s;ire to enter) as in two days &s;he was to accompany Mrs. Dun|can to lodgings in the neighbouring town; &s;he accord|ingly &s;aid &s;he had a mind to walk a little longer. Mrs. Bruce bid her beware of catching cold, and Mrs. Dun|can &s;aid &s;he was too fond of &s;olitary rambles; but no oppo&s;ition being made to her intention &s;he hurried to the Chapel, and entering the little arched door, found her&s;elf in a lofty hall, in the centre of which was a grand &s;tairca&s;e, the whole enlightened by a large Goth|ic window at the head of the &s;tairs. She a&s;cended them with a trepidation, for her foot&s;teps produced a hollow echo, which added &s;omething awful to the gloom that enveloped her. On gaining the top of the &s;tairs &s;he &s;aw two large folding doors on either &s;ide, both clo&s;ed. She knew the direction to take, and, by a &s;mall exertion of &s;trength, pulled the one on the left &s;ide open, and per|ceived a long gallery, which &s;he knew was terminated by the apartments &s;he wanted to vi&s;it: Its almo&s;t total darkne&s;s, however, nearly conquered her wi&s;h, and &s;hook her re&s;olution of proceeding; but a&s;hamed, even to her|&s;elf, to give way to &s;uper&s;titious fears, or turn back without gratifying her inclination after going &s;o far, &s;he advanced into the gallery, though with a trembling &s;tep, and as &s;he let the door out of her hand, it &s;hut too with a violence that &s;hook the whole building. The gallery on one &s;ide had a row of arched doors, and on the other an equal number of windows; but &s;o &s;mall, and placed &s;o high as &s;carcely to admit a ray of light. Amanda's heart began to beat with unu&s;ual quickne&s;s, and &s;he thought &s;he &s;hould never reach the end of the gallery. She at la&s;t came to a door, it was clo&s;ed, not fa&s;tened; &s;he pu&s;hed it gently open, and could ju&s;t di&s;|cern a &s;pacious room; this &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed had been her mother's dre&s;&s;ing-room; the moon-beams, as if to aid her wi&s;h of examining it, &s;uddenly darted through the ca&s;ements.

into the room; at the upper end of it &s;omething in white attracted her notice: She concluded it to be the portrait of Lady Malvina's mother, which &s;he had been informed hung in this room. She went up to ex|amine it; but her horror may be better conceived than de&s;cribed, when &s;he found her&s;elf not by a picture, but by the real form of a woman, with a death-like counte|nance! She &s;creamed wildly at the terrifying &s;pectre, for &s;uch &s;he believed it to be, and as quick lightning flew from the room. Again was the moon ob&s;cured by a cloud, and &s;he involved in utter darkne&s;s. She ran with &s;uch violence, that as &s;he reached the door at the end of the gallery, &s;he fell again&s;t it. Extremely hurt, &s;he had not power to move for a few minutes, but while &s;he involuntary pau&s;ed &s;he heard approaching foot&s;teps. Wild with terror, &s;he in&s;tantly recovered her faculties, and attempted opening it; but it re&s;i&s;ted all her efforts. "Protect me, Heaven!" &s;he exclaimed, and at the mo|ment felt an icy hand upon her's! Her &s;en&s;es in&s;tantly receded, and &s;he &s;unk to the floor. When &s;he recovered from her in&s;en&s;ibility, &s;he perceived a glimmering light around her. She opened her eyes with fearfulne&s;s, but no object appeared, and to her great joy &s;he &s;aw the door &s;tanding open, and found that the light proceeded from the large window. She in&s;tantly ro&s;e, and de&s;cended the &s;tair-ca&s;e with as much ha&s;te as her trembling limbs could make; but again, what was her horror when, on enter|ing the Chapel, the fir&s;t object &s;he beheld was the &s;ame that had already alarmed her &s;o much! She made a &s;pring to e&s;cape through the entrance, but the apparition, with a rapidity equal to her own, glided before her, and with a hollow voice, as &s;he waved her emaciated hand, ex|claimed, "Forbear to go."</P>
<P>A deadly faintne&s;s again came over Amanda; &s;he &s;unk upon a broken &s;eat, and put her hand over her eyes to &s;hut out the frightful vi&s;ion.</P>
<P>"Lo&s;e," continued the figure, in a hallow voice, "lo&s;e your &s;uper&s;titious fears, and in me behold not an airy inhabitant of the other world, but a &s;inful, &s;orrowing, and repentant woman."</P>

The terrors of Amanda gave way to this unexpected addre&s;s; but her &s;urprize <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">as equal to what the&s;e ter|rors had been; &s;he withdrew her hand, and gazed at|tentively on the form before her.</P>

<P>"I am indeed her child," replied Amanda: "Tell me then by what means you have been brought hither; you called your&s;elf a &s;tranger, and a dependant in the hou&s;e of your ance&s;tors."</P>
<P>"I am both," &s;aid Amanda; "my real name is con|cealed from circum&s;tances peculiarly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, and I have been brought to the Abbey as an in&s;tructre&s;s to two children related to the per&s;on who takes care of it."</P>
<P>"My prayers at length," exclaimed the gha&s;tly fig|ure, rai&s;ing her hollow eyes and emaciated hands, "my prayers have reached the Throne of Mercy, and, as a proof that my repentance is accepted, power is given me to make reparation for the injuries I have committed."</P>
<P>"Oh! thou," &s;he cried, turning to Amanda, "who&s;e form revives in my remembrance the youth and beauty bla&s;ted by my means, if thy mind as well as face, re&s;em|bles Lady Malvina's thou wilt in pity to my &s;ufferings, forbear to reproach my crimes.

<P>Amanda &s;tarted: Oh, gracious Heaven!" &s;he ex|claimed, "can this be po&s;&s;ible?</P>
<P>"Have you not been taught to execrate my name?" a&s;ked the unhappy woman.</P>
<P>"Oh! no," replied Amanda.</P>
<P>"No," replied Lady Dunreath, "becau&s;e your mo|ther was an angel; but did &s;he not leave a &s;on?"</P>
<P>"Yes," &s;aid Amanda."&mdash;"And does he live?"</P>
<P>"Alas! I do not know," replied Amanda, melting into tears; "di&s;tre&s;s &s;eparated us, and he is not more ignorant of my de&s;tiny than I am of his."</P>

"It is I," exclaimed Lady Dunreath, "have been the cau&s;e of this di&s;tre&s;s; it is I, &s;weet and &s;ainted Mal|vina, have been the cau&s;e of calamity to your children; but ble&s;&s;ed be the wonder-working hand of Providence," &s;he continued, "which has given me an opportunity of making &s;ome amends for my cruelty and inju&s;tice: but," &s;he proceeded, "as I know the chance which led you to the Chapel, I dread to detain you longer, le&s;t it &s;hould lead to a di&s;covery.

In the mean time do you throw upon paper a brief account of your life, that I may know the incidents which &s;o providentially brought you to the Abbey." Amanda promi&s;ed to obey her in every re&s;pect, and the unfortunate woman, unable longer to &s;peak, ki&s;&s;ed her hand, and retired through the little arched door. A|manda left the Chapel, and full of wonder, pity and expectation, moved mechanically to the parlour. Mrs. Bruce and Mrs. Duncan had ju&s;t ri&s;en from cards, and both were in&s;tantly &s;truck with her pallid and di&s;ordered looks. They inquired if &s;he was ill: their inquiries rou&s;ed her from a deep reverie. She recollected the danger of exciting &s;u&s;picions, and replied, "&s;he was only fatigued with walking, and begged leave to retire to her chamber." Mrs. Duncan attended her to it, and would have &s;at with her till &s;he &s;aw her in bed, had A|manda allowed; but it was not her intention indeed to go to bed, for &s;ome time; when left to her&s;elf, the &s;urpri&s;ing and intere&s;ting di&s;covery &s;he had made had &s;o agitated her, that &s;he could &s;carcely compo&s;e her&s;elf enough to take up a pen to narrate the particulars of her life, as Lady Dunreath had reque&s;ted. She &s;ketched them in a brief yet ha&s;ty manner, &s;ufficiently &s;trong, however, to intere&s;t the feelings of a &s;ympathe|tic heart: the tender and peculiar &s;orrows of her own

&s;he omitted; her life was repre&s;ented &s;ufficiently calami|tous, without mentioning the incurable &s;orrow which di&s;|appointed love had entailed upon it. She was glad &s;he had executed her ta&s;k with ha&s;te, as Mrs. Duncan cal|led upon her in the cour&s;e of the next day to a&s;&s;i&s;t in packing for their removal to the neighbouring town. The evening was far advanced ere &s;he had an opportu|nity of repairing to the Chapel, where &s;he found the unfortunate Lady Dunreath re&s;ting, in an attitude of deep de&s;pondence, again&s;t rails of the altar.</P>
<P>Her pale and woe-worn countenance&mdash;her emaciated form&mdash;her &s;olitary &s;ituation&mdash;all in&s;pired Amanda with the tendere&s;t compa&s;&s;ion, and &s;he dropped a tear upon the cold and withered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">and which was extended to her's as &s;he approached. "I merit not the tear of pity," &s;aid the unhappy woman, "yet it ca&s;ts a gleam of comfort on my heart to meet with a being who feels for its &s;or|rows, but the moments are precious." She then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed A|manda to the altar, and &s;tooping down, de&s;ired her a&s;&s;i&s;tance in removing a &s;mall marble flag beneath it. This being effected with difficulty, Amanda perceived an iron box, which &s;he al&s;o a&s;&s;i&s;ted in rai&s;ing. La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y Dunreath then took a key from her bo&s;om, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">h which &s;he opened it, and took from thence a &s;ealed paper. "Receive &s;aid &s;he, pre&s;enting it to Amanda, "re|ceive the will of your grandfather, a &s;acred depo&s;it&punc; en|tru&s;ted to your care for your brother, the rightful heir of the Earl of Dunreath. Oh! may its re&s;toration, and my &s;incere repentance, atone for its long detention and concealment: Oh! may the fortune it will be&s;tow upon you as well as your brother, be productive to both of the pure&s;t happine&s;s!"</P>
<P>Trembling with joyful &s;urpri&s;e, Amanda received the paper: "Gracious Heaven!" exclaimed &s;he, "is it po&s;&s;ible? do I really hold the will of my grandfather&mdash;a will which will entitle my brother to affluence.&mdash;Oh! Providence, how my&s;terious are thy ways! Oh! O&s;car, beloved of my heart," &s;he continued, forgetting at that moment every con&s;ideration of &s;elf, "could thy &s;i&s;ter have po&s;&s;ibly fore&s;een her &s;orrows would have

led to &s;uch a di&s;covery, half their bitterne&s;s would have been allayed. Yes, my father, one of thy children may at lea&s;t be happy, and in witne&s;&s;ing that happine&s;s, the other will find a mitigation of mi&s;ery." Tears bur&s;t from her as &s;he &s;poke, and relieved the &s;trong emo|tions that &s;welled her heart, almo&s;t to bur&s;ting.</P>
<P>"Oh! talk not of your mi&s;ery," &s;aid Lady Dunreath, with a convul&s;ive &s;igh, "le&s;t you drive me to de&s;pair. Forever mu&s;t I accu&s;e my&s;elf of being the real &s;ource of calamity to Lady Malvina and her children."</P>
<P>"Excu&s;e me," cried Amanda, wiping her eyes, "I &s;hould be ungrateful to Heaven and to you if I dwelt upon my &s;orrows; but let me not neglect this opportu|nity," &s;he continued, "of enquiring if there is any way in which I can po&s;&s;ibly &s;erve you. Is there no friend to whom I could apply in your name, to have you re|lea&s;ed from this cruel and unju&s;tifiable confinement?"</P>
<P>"No," &s;aid Lady Dunreath, "no &s;uch friend exi&s;ts; when I had the power to do &s;o, I never conciliated friend|&s;hip, and if I am &s;till remembered in the world, it is on|ly with contempt and abhorrence. The laws of my country would certainly liberate me at once; but if things turn out as I expect, there will be no occa&s;ion for an application to them, and any &s;tep of that kind at pre&s;ent might be attended with the mo&s;t unplea&s;ant con|&s;equences; your future pro&s;perity, my pre&s;ent &s;afety, all depend on &s;ecrecy for a &s;hort period. In this paper," drawing one from her pocket, and pre&s;enting it to A|manda, "I have explained my rea&s;on for de&s;iring &s;uch &s;ecrecy." Amanda put it with the will into her bo&s;om, and gave in return the little narrative &s;he had &s;ketched. They both a&s;&s;i&s;ted in replacing the box and flag, and then &s;eated them&s;elves on the &s;teps of the altar. A|manda informed Lady Dunreath of her intended depar|ture the next day from the Abbey, and the occa&s;ion of it. Lady Dunreath expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t impatience to have every thing put into a proper train for the avowal of the will, declaring that the &s;ight of the rightful heir in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Abbey, would calm the agitations of a &s;pirit which, &s;he believed, would &s;oon for&s;ake its
<PB N="154" REF="038416_0554_1011E636909E9BB0">
earthly habitation. Tears of compa&s;&s;ion fell from A|manda at the&s;e words, and &s;he &s;huddered to think that the unfortunate woman might die abandoned, and be|reft of comfort; again &s;he urged her to think of &s;ome expedient for procuring immediate liberty, and again Lady Dunreath a&s;&s;ured her it was impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Ab&s;orbed in a kind of &s;ympathetic melancholy, they forgot the danger of delay till the Abbey clock chiming half an hour pa&s;t ten, which was later than Mrs. Bruce's u&s;ual hour of &s;upper, &s;tartled and alarmed them both. "Go, go," cried Lady Dunreath, with wild expre&s;|&s;ion of fear, "go, or we are undone!" Amanda pre&s;&s;ed her hand in &s;ilence, and trembling departed from the Chapel. She &s;topped at the out&s;ide to li&s;ten, for by her ear alone could &s;he now receive any intimation of dan|ger, as the night was too dark to permit any object to be di&s;cerned; but the breeze &s;ighing among&s;t the trees of the valley, and the melancholy murmur of waterfalls were the only &s;ounds &s;he heard. She groped along the wall of the Chapel to keep in the path, which wound from it to to entrance of the Abbey, and in doing &s;o pa&s;&s;ed her hand over the cold face of a human being; terrified, an involuntary &s;cream bur&s;t from her, and &s;he faintly articulated: "Defend me, Heaven! In the next moment &s;he was &s;eized round the wai&s;t, and her fen&s;es were receding, when Mrs. Duncan's voice recal|led them. She apologized to Amanda for giving her &s;uch a fright; but &s;aid, that her unea&s;ine&s;s was &s;o great at her long ab&s;ence that, attended by a &s;ervant, &s;he had come in que&s;t of her."</P>
<P>Mrs. Duncan's voice relieved Amanda from the hor|ror of thinking &s;he had met with a per&s;on who would in&s;ult her; but it had given ri&s;e to a new alarm. She feared &s;he had been traced to the Chapel, that her di&s;|cour&s;e with Lady Dunreath had been overheard, and of cour&s;e the &s;ecret of the will di&s;covered, and tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Mrs. Duncan, amiable as &s;he was, might &s;acrifice friend&s;hip to intere&s;t and con&s;anguinity. This idea overwhelmed her with angui&s;h; her deep and heavy &s;ighs, her violent trembling, alarmed Mrs. Duncan, who ha&s;tily called the
<PB N="155" REF="038416_0555_1011E63ADCB95520">
&s;ervant to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in &s;upporting Amanda home; drops were then admini&s;tered, but they would have wanted their u&s;ual efficacy with the poor night wanderer, had &s;he not &s;oon been convinced by Mrs. Duncan's manner &s;he had not made the dreaded di&s;covery.</P>
<P>Amanda would have retired to her chamber before &s;upper, but that &s;he feared di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Mrs. Duncan by doing &s;o, who would have imputed her indi&s;po&s;ition to her fright.&mdash;She accordingly remained in the parlour, but with a mind &s;o occupied by the intere&s;ting events of the evening, that &s;he &s;oon forgot the purpo&s;e for which &s;he &s;at down to table, and neither heeded what was doing or &s;aying. From this reverie &s;he was &s;udden|ly rou&s;ed by the &s;ound of a name for ever dear and preci|ous, which in a moment had power to recall her wander|ing ideas. She rai&s;ed her eyes, and with a &s;ad intent|ne&s;s fixed them on Mrs. Bruce, who continued to talk of the approaching nuptials of Lord Mortimer. Tears now fell from Amanda in &s;pite of her efforts to re&s;train them, and while drooping her head to wipe them away, &s;he caught the eyes of Mrs. Duncan fa&s;tened on her with an expre&s;&s;ion of mingled pity and curio&s;ity. A deep crim&s;on &s;uffu&s;ed the face of Amanda at the con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s of having betrayed the &s;ecret of her heart; but her confu&s;ion was inferior to her grief, and the rich &s;uf|fu&s;ion of one &s;oon gave place to the deadly hue of the other. "Ah!" thought &s;he, "what is now the acqui|&s;ition of wealth when happine&s;s is beyond my reach!" Yet &s;carcely had &s;he conceived the thought ere &s;he wi&s;h|ed it buried in oblivion; "Is the comfort of indepen|dence, the power of di&s;pen&s;ing happine&s;s to others, nothing?" &s;he a&s;ked her&s;elf. "Do they not merit gratitude of the mo&s;t pure thankfulne&s;s, of the mo&s;t fervent nature, to providence? They do," &s;he cried, and paid them at the moment in the &s;ilent tribute of her heart.</P>
<P>It was late ere the ladies &s;eparated for the night, and as &s;oon as Amanda had &s;ecured the door of her cham|ber, &s;he drew from her bo&s;om the papers &s;o carefully depo&s;ited in them, and &s;at down to peru&s;e the narrative of Lady Dunreath.</P>

<P>ADORING the Power who has given me means of making re&s;titution for my inju&s;tice, I take up my pen to di&s;clo&s;e to your view, oh! lovely orphan of the injured Malvina, the frailties of a heart which has long been tortu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed with the retro&s;pect of pa&s;t and the pre&s;&s;ure of pre&s;ent evil. Convinced, as I have already &s;aid, that if your mind as well as form re&s;embles your mother's, you will, while you condemn the &s;inner com|mi&s;erate the penitent, and touched by that penitence, offer up a prayer to heaven (and the prayers of innocence are ever availing) for its forgivene&s;s unto me. Many years are now elap&s;ed &s;ince the commencement of my confinement, years which dimini&s;hed my hope of being able to make reparation for the inju&s;tice and cruelty I had done Lady Malvina Fitzalan, but left unabated my de&s;ire of doing &s;o.</P>
<P>Ah, &s;weet Malvina! from thy &s;oft voice I was doom|ed never to hear my pardon pronounced; but from thy child I may, perhaps have it accorded; if &s;o, from that bli&s;sful abode, where thou now enjoye&s;t felicity, if the departed &s;ouls of the happy are allowed to view the tran&s;actions of the world, thine, I am convinced, will behold with benignancy and compa&s;&s;ion, the wretch,

who covers her&s;elf with &s;hame to atone for her injuries to thee.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t re&s;train the&s;e effu&s;ions of my heart, le&s;t I encroach too much upon the limited time allotted to make what I may call my confe&s;&s;ion, and inform you of particulars nece&s;&s;ary to be known.</P>
<P>My cruelty and in&s;olence to Lady Malvina you no doubt already know, in my conduct to her. I forgot the obligations her mother had conferred upon me, who&s;e patronage and kind protection laid the foundation of my pro&s;perity. I rejoiced at her marriage with Cap|tain Fitzalan, as a &s;tep that would deprive her of her father's favour, and place her in that &s;tate of poverty which would conceal charms I dete&s;ted for being &s;uperi|or to my daughter's.&mdash;The Earl's re&s;entment was vio|lent at fir&s;t; but with equal &s;urpri&s;e and concern I &s;oon perceived it gradually &s;ub&s;iding; their revocablene&s;s of the deed, the knowldge that he wanted no acqui&s;ition of fortune; above all, Fitzalan's noble de&s;cent, and the graces and virtues he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, worthy of the highe&s;t &s;tation, dwelt upon the Earl's imagination, and pleaded &s;trongly in extenuation of his daughter; alarmed le&s;t my &s;chemes again&s;t her &s;hould be rendered abortive, like an evil &s;pirit I contrived to rekindle, by means of my agents, the Earl's re&s;entment, they pre&s;ented the fla|grant, the daring contempt Lady Malvina had &s;hewn to paternal authority, and that too ea&s;y a forgivene&s;s to it might influence her &s;i&s;ter to &s;imilar conduct with a per|&s;on perhaps le&s;s worthy, and more needy, if po&s;&s;ible, than Fitzalan. This la&s;t &s;ugge&s;tion had the de&s;ired effect, and Lady Malvina be declared in future &s;hould be con&s;idered as alien to his f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ly.</P>
<P>I now hoped my ambitious views, relative to my daughter, would be accompli&s;hed; I had long wi&s;hed her united to the Marquis of Ro&s;line; but he had for years been Lady Malvina's admirer, and was &s;o much attached to her, that on her marriage he went abroad. My arts were then tried to prevail on the Earl to make a will in Lady Augu&s;ta's favour; but this was a point
<PB N="158" REF="038416_0558_1011E6435E9A1370">
I could not accompli&s;h, and I lived in continual appre|hen&s;ion, le&s;t his dying inte&s;tate &s;hould give Lady Mal|vina the fortune I wanted to deprive her of. Anxious, however, to procure a &s;plendid e&s;tabli&s;hment for my daughter, I every where &s;aid there was no doubt but &s;he would be &s;ole heire&s;s to the Earl. At the expiration of three years the Marquis returned to his native coun|try; his unfortunate pa&s;&s;ion was &s;ubdued, he heard and believed the reports I circulated, and &s;timulated by avarice, his leading propen&s;ity, offered his hand to my daughter, and was accepted. The Earl gave her a large portion in ready money; but, notwith&s;tanding all my endeavours, would not make a &s;ettlement of any of his e&s;tates upon her: I however &s;till hoped, and the Marquis from what I &s;aid, believed that &s;he would po&s;&s;e&s;s all his fortune.&mdash;My daughter's nuptials added to my natu|ral haughtine&s;s; they al&s;o increa&s;ed my love of plea&s;ure by affording me more amply the means of gratifying it at the &s;umptuous entertainments at the Marquis's Ca&s;|tle; engaged continually in them, the Earl, who&s;e in|firmities confined him to the Abbey, was left to &s;olitude, and the care of his dome&s;tics. My neglect, you will &s;ay, was impolitic, whil&s;t I had any point to carry with him; but Providence has &s;o wi&s;ely ordained it that vice &s;hould &s;till defeat it&s;elf. Had I always acted in uni|formity with the tenderne&s;s I once &s;hewed the Earl, I have little doubt but what at la&s;t I &s;hould have prevailed on him to act as I plea&s;ed; but infatuated by plea&s;ure, my prudence, no, it de&s;erves not &s;uch an appellations, for&s;ook me: though the Earl's body was a prey to the infirmities of age, his mind knew none of its imbecili|ties, and he &s;en&s;ibly felt, and &s;ecretly re&s;ented my ne|glect; the more he reflected on it, the more he con|tra&s;ted it with the attention he was accu&s;tomed to re|ceive from his bani&s;hed Malvina, and the re&s;entment I had hitherto kept alive in his mind again&s;t her gradually &s;ub&s;ided, &s;o that he was well prepared to give a favorable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to the little innocent advocate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he &s;ent to plead her cau&s;e. My terror, my dismay, when I &s;urpri&s;ed the little O&s;car at the knee of his grandfather are not to be de|&s;cribed!
<PB N="159" REF="038416_0559_1011E646F029F4C0">
The tears, which the agitated parent &s;hed upon the infants lovely cheek &s;eemed to expre&s;s affection for its mother, and regrets for its rigour to her; yet amid&s;t the&s;e tears I thought I perceived an exulting joy as he gazed upon the child, which &s;eemed to &s;ay, "Thou wilt yet be the pride, the prop, the ornament of my ancient hou&s;e." After circum&s;tances proved I was right in my interpretation of his looks: I drove the little O&s;car from the room with frantic rage. The Earl was extremely affected. He knew the violence of my temper, and felt too weak to enter into any altercation with me; he therefore re&s;erved his little remaining &s;trength and &s;pi|rits to arrange his affairs, and by pa&s;&s;ivene&s;s &s;eemed yielding to my &s;way; but I &s;oon found though &s;ilent, he was re&s;olute. My preventing your brother from again gaining acce&s;s to his grandfather, and my repul&s;ing your mother when &s;he reque&s;ted an interview with the Earl, I &s;uppo&s;e you already know. Gracious Heaven! my heart &s;ickens, even at this remote period, when I reflect on the night I turned her from her paternal home, from that man&s;ion, under who&s;e roof her benevolent mother had &s;heltered my tender years from the rude &s;torms of adver&s;e life. Oh! black and ba&s;e ingratitude, dire re|turn for the benefits I had received, yet almo&s;t at the very in&s;tant I committed &s;o cruel an action, &s;he was avenged. No language can de&s;cribe my horrors as con|&s;cience repre&s;ented to me the barbarity of my conduct. I trembled with involuntary fears; &s;ounds had power to terrify; every bla&s;t which &s;hook the Abbey (and dread|ful was the tempe&s;ts of that night) made me &s;hrink, as if about to meet with an in&s;tantaneous puni&s;hment.</P>

<P>I knew the Earl expected either to &s;ee or hear from your mother; he was ignorant of the reception &s;he had met from me, and I was determined, if po&s;&s;ible, he &s;hould continue &s;o. As &s;oon as certified of Lady Mal|vina's departure from the neighbourhood of the Ab|bey, I contrived a letter, in Captain Fitzalan's name,
<PB N="160" REF="038416_0560_1011E649B80C6B50">
to the Earl, filled with the mo&s;t cutting and in&s;olent re|proaches to him for his conduct to his daughter, and imputing her precipitate departure from Scotland to it. The&s;e unju&s;t reproaches I tru&s;ted would irritate the Earl and work another revolution in his mind, but I was di&s;|appointed; he either believed the letter a forgery, or el&s;e re&s;olved the children &s;hould not &s;uffer for the fault of the parent, he accordingly &s;ent for his agent, an emi|nent lawyer in one of the neighbouring towns. This man was lately decea&s;ed, but his &s;on bred to his profe&s;|&s;ion, obeyed the &s;ummons from the Abbey. I dread|ed his coming, but &s;carely had I &s;een him ere this dread was lo&s;t in emotions till then unknown; a &s;oft, a tender, an ardent pa&s;&s;ion took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my heart, on beholding a man, in the very prime of life, adorned with every natural and acquired grace that could plea&s;e the eye and ear, married at an early period, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the advantages of art, &s;aid and believing my&s;elf to be hand&s;ome, I flattered my&s;elf I might on his heart make an impre&s;&s;ion equal to that he had done on mine; if &s;o I thought how ea&s;ily could the Earl's intentions, in favour of his daughter, be defeated, for that love will readily make &s;acrifices I had often heard. A will was made, but my new ideas and &s;chemes dive&s;ted me of unea&s;ine&s;s about it. Melro&s;s continued at the Abbey much longer than he need have done, and when he left it his ab&s;ence was of &s;hort continuance. The Earl's bu&s;ine&s;s was his pretext for his long and frequent vi&s;its; but the real motive of them he &s;oon di&s;covered to me, encouraged no doubt by the partiality I betrayed. I &s;hall not dwell on this part of my &s;tory, but I completed my crime by violating my conjugial fidelity, and we en|gaged to be united whenever I was at liberty, which from the infirm &s;tate of the Earl, I now believed would &s;hortly be the ca&s;e. In con&s;equence of this Melro&s;s agreed to put into my hands the Earl's will, which had been entru&s;ted to his care, and he acknowledged drawn up entirely in favour of Lady Malvina Fitzalan and her offspring: It was witne&s;&s;ed by friends of his, whom he had no doubt of bribing to &s;ilence. You may wonder
<PB N="161" REF="038416_0561_1011E64B4983AF28">
that the will was not de&s;troyed as &s;oon as I had it in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but to do &s;o never was my intention; by keeping it in my hands I tru&s;ted I &s;hould have a power over my daughter, which duty and affection had never yet given me. Violent and imperious in her di&s;po&s;ition, I doubted not but &s;he and the Marquis, who nearly re|&s;embled her in the&s;e particulars, would endeavour to pre|vent, from pride and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, my union with Melro&s;s; but to know they were in my power would cru&s;h all op|po&s;ition I &s;uppo&s;ed, and obtain their mo&s;t flattering no|tice for him&mdash;a notice, from my pride, I found e&s;&s;ential to my tranquillity. The Earl reque&s;ted Melro&s;s to enquire about Lady Malvina, which he promi&s;ed to do; but it is almo&s;t unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay, never fulfilled &s;uch a promi&s;e. In about a year after the commencement of my attach|ment for Melro&s;s he expired, and the Marchione&s;s inhe|rited his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions by means of a forged will executed by Melro&s;s. Ignorant indeed at the time that it was by iniquity &s;he obtained them, though her conduct &s;ince that period has proved &s;he would not have &s;uffered any compunction from &s;uch a knowledge. I removed from the Abbey to an e&s;tate about fifteen miles from it, which the Earl had left me, and here, much &s;ooner than decen|cy would have warranted, avowed my intention of mar|rying Melro&s;s to the Marquis and Marchione&s;s of Ro&s;|line. The con&s;equences of this avowal were pretty much what I had expected. The Marquis, more by looks than words, expre&s;&s;ed his contempt; but the Mar|chione&s;s openly declared her indignation; to think of uniting my&s;elf to a being &s;o low in life and fortune, &s;he &s;aid, as Melro&s;s, was an in&s;ult to the memory of her father, and a degradation to his illu&s;trious hou&s;e; it would al&s;o be a confirmation of the &s;candalous reports which had already been circulated to the prejudice of my character about him. Her words rou&s;ed all the violence of my &s;oul: I upbraided her with ingratitude to a pa|rent, who had &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">pped beyond the bounds of rigid pro|priety to give her an increa&s;e of fortune. My words alarmed her and the Marquis. They ha&s;tily demanded
<PB N="162" REF="038416_0562_1011E64CD7D4E420">
an explanation of them. I did not, he&s;itate in giving one, prote&s;ting at the &s;ame time that I would no longer hurt my feelings on their account, as I found no com|plai&s;ance to my wi&s;hes, but immediately avow Lady Malvina Fitzalan the lawful heire&s;s of the Earl of Dun|reath. The Marquis and Marchione&s;s changed colour; I &s;aw they trembled le&s;t I &s;hould put my threats into execution, though with con&s;ummate art they pretended to di&s;believe that &s;uch a will as I mentioned exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>"Beware," cried I, ri&s;ing from my chair to quit the room, "le&s;t I give you too convincing a proof of its re|ality; except I meet with the attention and complai&s;ance I have a right to expect, I &s;hall no longer act contrary to the dictates of my con&s;cience by concealing it. Un|limited mi&s;tre&s;s of my own actions, what but affection for my daughter could make me con&s;ult her upon any of them? Her di&s;approbation proceeds alone from &s;elfi&s;h|ne&s;s, &s;ince an alliance with Melro&s;s, from his profe&s;&s;ion, accompli&s;hments and birth, would not di&s;grace a hou&s;e even more illu&s;trious than the one &s;he is de&s;cended from or connected to." I retired to my chamber, &s;ecretly ex|ulting at the idea of having conquered all oppo&s;ition, for I plainly perceived by the Marquis and Marchione&s;s's manner, they were convinced it was in my power to de|prive them of their newly acquired po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, which, to &s;ecure, I doubted not their &s;acrificing their pride to my wi&s;hes: I exulted in the idea of having my nuptials with Melro&s;s celebrated with that &s;plendour I alwas delight|ed in, and the pro&s;pect of having love and vanity gra|tified, filled me with a kind of intoxicating happine&s;s. In a few hours after I had retired to my room, the Mar|chione&s;s &s;ent to reque&s;t an interview with me, which I readily granted. She entered the apartment with a re|&s;pectful air, very unu&s;ual to her, and immediately made an apology for her late conduct. She acknowledged I had rea&s;on to be offended; but a little reflection had con|vinced her of her error, and both &s;he and the Marquis thanked me for con&s;ulting them about the change I was about making in my &s;ituation, and would pay every at|tention in their power to the man I had honoured with
<PB N="163" REF="038416_0563_1011E65011D579B8">
my choice. That I did not think the Marchione&s;s &s;in|cere in her profe&s;&s;ions you may believe, but complai|&s;ance was all I required. I accompanied her to the Marquis; a general reconciliation en&s;ued, and Melro&s;s was pre&s;ented to them.</P>
<P>In about two days after this the Marchione&s;s came in|to my dre&s;&s;ing room one morning, and told me &s;he had a propo&s;al to make, which &s;he hoped would be agreeable to me to comply with: It was the Marquis's intention and her's to go immediately to the Continent, and they had been thinking, if Melro&s;s and I would favour them with our company, that we had better defer our nuptials till we reached Paris, which was the fir&s;t place they in|tended vi&s;iting, as their &s;olemnization in Scotland &s;o &s;oon after the Earl's decea&s;e might di&s;plea&s;e his friends, by whom we were &s;urrounded, and on their return, which would be &s;oon&punc; they would introduce Melro&s;s to their connexions, as a man every way worthy of their notice.</P>
<P>After a little he&s;itation I agreed to this plan, for where it interfered not with my own inclinations, I wi&s;h|ed to pre&s;erve an appearance of propriety to the world, and I could not avoid thinking that my marrying &s;o &s;oon after the Earl's death would draw cen&s;ure upon me, which I &s;hould avoid by the projected tour, as the cer|tain time of my nuptials could not then be a&s;certained. Melro&s;s &s;ubmitted cheerfully to our new arrangements, and it was &s;ettled, farther to pre&s;erve appearances, that he &s;hould go before us to Paris. I &s;upplied him with every thing requi&s;ite for making an elegant appearance, and he departed in high &s;pirits at the pro&s;pect of his &s;plendid e&s;tabli&s;hment for life.</P>
<P>I counted the moments with impatience for rejoining him, and, as had been &s;ettled, we commenced our jour|ney a month after his departure. It was now the mid|dle of winter, and ere we &s;topped for the night, dark|ne&s;s, almo&s;t impenetrable, had veiled the earth, fatigued and almo&s;t exhau&s;ted by the cold, I followed the Mar|quis through a long pa&s;&s;age, lighted by a glimmering lamp, to a parlour which was well lighted, and had a comfortable fire. I &s;tarted with amazement on entering
<PB N="164" REF="038416_0564_1011E6539F589110">
it, at finding my&s;elf in a place I thought familiar to me; my &s;urpri&s;e, however was but for an in&s;tant, yet I could not help expre&s;&s;ing it to the Marquis. "Your eyes, Madam," cried he, with a cruel &s;olemnity, "have not deceived you, for yea are now in Dunreath Abbey."</P>
<P>"Dunreath Abbey!" I repeated: "Gracious Hea|ven! what can be the meaning of this?"</P>
<P>"To hide your folly, your imprudence, your deceit, from the world," he exclaimed; "to prevent your exe|cuting the wild projects of a depraved and di&s;tempered mind, by entering into an union at once contemptible and prepo&s;terous, and to &s;ave tho&s;e, from whom alone you derive your con&s;equence, by your connexion with them, farther mortification on your account."</P>
<P>To de&s;cribe fully the effect of this &s;peech upon a heart like mine is impo&s;&s;ible; the fury which pervaded my &s;oul would, I believe, have hurried me into a deed of dire revenge, had I had the power of executing it, my quivering lips could not expre&s;s my &s;trong indig|nation.</P>
<P>"And do you then, in a country like this," I cried, "dare to think you can deprive me of my liberty?"</P>
<P>"Yes," replied he, with in&s;ulting coolne&s;s, "when it is known you are incapable of making a proper u&s;e of that liberty; you &s;hould thank me, he continued, "for palliating your late conduct, by imputing it rather to an intellectual derangement than to total depravity; from what other &s;ource than the former could you have a&s;|&s;erted that there was a will in Lady Malvina Fitzalan's favour?" The&s;e words at once developed the cau&s;e of his unju&s;tifiable conduct, and proved that there is no real faith between the guilty. From my di&s;po&s;ition the Marquis was convinced that I would a&s;&s;ume a haughty &s;way over him, in con&s;equence of the &s;ecret of the will: He al&s;o dreaded that pa&s;&s;ion or caprice might one day induce me to betray that &s;ecret, and wre&s;t from him his unlawful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; thus pride and avarice tempt|ed and determined him, by confining me, to rid him|&s;elf of the&s;e fears.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="038416_0565_1011E6571CCB3B28">
"Oh! would to heaven, cried I, replying to the la&s;t part of his &s;peech, "I had proved my a&s;&s;ertion; had I done ju&s;tice to others, I &s;hould not have been entangled in the &s;nare of treachery."</P>
<P>"Prove the a&s;&s;ertion now," &s;aid he, "by &s;hewing me the will, and you may, perhaps," he continued, in a he&s;itating accent, "find your doing &s;o attended with plea&s;ing con&s;equences." Rage and &s;corn fla&s;hed from my eyes at the&s;e words. "No," cried I, "had you the power of torturing, you &s;hould not tear it from me. I will keep it to atone for my &s;ins, and expo&s;e your's to view by re&s;toring it to the right owner. I demanded my liberty, I threatened, &s;upplicated, but all in vain. The Marquis told me I might as well compo&s;e my&s;elf, for my fate was decided."</P>
<P>"You know," cri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> he, with a malicious look, "you have no friends to enquire or interfere about you, and even if you had, when I told them what I believe to be the ca&s;e, that your &s;en&s;es were di&s;ordered, they would never de&s;ire to have you relea&s;ed from this confinement. I called for my daughter."&mdash;"You will &s;ee her no more," he replied," the pa&s;&s;ions &s;he has &s;o long blu&s;hed to behold &s;he will no more witne&s;s."</P>
<P>"Rather &s;ay," I exclaimed, "that &s;he dare not be|hold her injured parent, but let not the wretch, who has &s;evered the ties of nature, hope to e&s;cape unpuni&s;hed; no, my &s;ufferings will draw a dreadful weight upon her head, and may, when lea&s;t expected, torture her heart with angui&s;h." Canvinced that I was entirely in the Marquis's power, convinced that I had nothing to hope from him or my daughter, rage, horror and agony, at their unju&s;t and audacious treatment, kindled in my brea&s;t a &s;udden frenzy, which &s;trong convul&s;ions only terminated. When I recovered from them I found my&s;elf on a bed in a room, which at the fir&s;t glance, I knew to be the one the late Lady Dunreath had occupi|ed, to who&s;e honours I &s;o unworthily &s;ucceeded. Mrs. Bruce, who had been hou&s;ekeeper at the Abbey before my marriage, &s;at be&s;ide me: I he&s;itated a few minutes whether I &s;hould addre&s;s her as a &s;uppliant or a &s;uperior;
<PB N="166" REF="038416_0566_1011E658E233D048">
the latter, however, being mo&s;t agreeable to my inclina|tions, I bid her, with an haughty air, which I hoped would awe her into obedience, a&s;&s;i&s;t me in ri&s;ing and pro|cure &s;ome conveyance from the Abbey without de|lay. The Marquis entered the chamber as I &s;poke. "Compo&s;e your&s;elf, madam," &s;aid he, "your de&s;tiny, I repeat it, is irrevocable; this Abbey is your future re&s;idence, and ble&s;s tho&s;e who have afforded your follies &s;uch an a&s;ylum; it behoves both the Marchione&s;s and me indeed to &s;eclude a woman who might ca&s;t imputa|tions on our characters, which tho&s;e unacquainted with them might believe." I &s;tarted from the bed, in the loo&s;e dre&s;s in which they had placed me on it, and &s;tamping round the room demanded my liberty.&mdash;The Marquis heard my demand with contemptuous &s;ilence, and quitted the room. I attempted to ru&s;h after him, but he pu&s;hed me back with violence, and clo&s;ed the door. My feelings again brought on convul&s;ions, which ter|minated in a delirium and fever. In this &s;ituation the Marquis and Marchione&s;s abandoned me, hoping, no doubt, that my di&s;order would &s;oon lay me in a pri&s;on, e|ven more &s;ecure than the one they had devoted me to. Many weeks elap&s;ed ere I &s;hewed any &s;ymptom of re|covery&punc; On regaining my &s;en&s;es I &s;eemed as if awaking from a tedious &s;leep, in which I had been tortured with frightful vi&s;ions. The fir&s;t object my eyes beheld, now ble&s;&s;ed with the powers of clear perception, was Mrs. Bruce bending over my pillow, with a look of anxiety and grief, which implied a wi&s;h, yet a doubt of my recovery.</P>
<P>"Tell me," &s;aid I, faintly, "am I really in Dunreath Abbey, am I really confined within its walls by order of my child?</P>
<P>Mrs. Bruce &s;ighed. "Do not di&s;turb your&s;elf with que&s;tions now," &s;aid &s;he; "the rea&s;on heaven has &s;o mercifully re&s;tored, would be ill employed in vain mur|murs."</P>
<P>"Vain murmurs!" I repeated, and a deep de&s;pond|ing &s;igh bur&s;t from my heart. I lay &s;ilent a long time after this; the gloom which e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">compa&s;&s;ed me at length grew too dreary to be borne, and I de&s;ired Mrs. Bruce
<PB N="167" REF="038416_0567_1011E65B9A2728F0">
to draw back the curtains of the bed and windows. She obeyed, and the bright beams of the &s;un darting into the room, di&s;played to my view an object I could not behold without &s;huddering; this was the portrait of Lady Dunreath exactly oppo&s;ite the bed. My mind was &s;oftened by illne&s;s, and I felt in that moment as if her &s;ainted &s;pirit &s;tood before me to awaken my con&s;cience to remor&s;e, and my heart to repentance, the benevolence which had irradiated the countenance of the original with a cele&s;tial expre&s;&s;ion, was powerfully expre&s;&s;ed up|on the canvas, and recalled, oh! how affectingly to my memory, the period in which this mo&s;t amiable of wo|men gave me a refuge in her hou&s;e, in her arms, from the &s;torms of life, and yet her child, I groaned her child I was acce&s;&s;ary in de&s;troying: Oh! how excruci|ating were my feelings at this period of awakened con|&s;cience; I no longer inveighed again&s;t my &s;ufferings; I con&s;idered them in the light of retribution, and felt an awful re&s;ignation take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my &s;oul. Yes, groaned I to my&s;elf, it is fit that in the very &s;pot in which I triumphed in deceit and cruelty, I &s;hould meet the puni&s;hment due to my mi&s;deeds.</P>
<P>The change in my di&s;po&s;ition produced a &s;imilar one in my temper, &s;o that Mrs. Bruce found the ta&s;k of at|tending on me, ea&s;ier than &s;he had imagined it would be; yet I did not &s;ubmit to my confinement, without many efforts to liberate my&s;elf through her means; but her fidelity to her unnatural employers was not to be &s;haken: Blu&s;hing, however, at my pa&s;t enormities, I &s;hould rather have &s;hrunk from that &s;olicited admi&s;|&s;ion again into the world, had not my ardent de&s;ire of making reparation to the de&s;cendants of Lady Dunreath influenced me to de&s;ire my freedom. Oh! never did that de&s;ire cea&s;e&mdash;never did a morning dawn, an eve|ning clo&s;e, without entreating Heaven to allow me the means of re&s;toring to the injured their inheritance. Mrs. Bruce, though &s;teady, was not cruel, and nur&s;ed me with the tendere&s;t attention till my health was re-e&s;|tabli&s;hed: She then cea&s;ed to &s;ee me except at night; but took care I &s;hould be always amply &s;tocked with ne|ce&s;&s;aries.

She &s;upplied me with religious and moral books; al&s;o materials for writing, if I cho&s;e to amu&s;e my&s;elf with making comments on them; To tho&s;e books I am indebted, for being able to endure, with &s;ome de|gree of calmne&s;s my long and dreadful captivity; they enlarged my heart, they enlightened its ideas concern|ing the Supreme Being, they impre&s;&s;ed it with awful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his Will, they convinced me more forcibly than my tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, yet with exciting de&s;pair, for while they &s;hewed me the horrors of vice, they proved the efficacy of repentance. Debarred of the common en|joyments of life, air, exerci&s;e and &s;ociety, in vain my heart a&s;&s;ured me my puni&s;hment was inadequate to my crimes, nature repined and a total languor &s;eized me. Mrs. Bruce at la&s;t told me that I &s;hould be allowed the range of that part of the building in which I was con|fined (for I had hitherto been limited to one room) and con&s;equently air from the windows, if I promi&s;ed to make no attempt for recovering my freedom, an at|tempt which &s;he a&s;&s;ured me would prove abortive, as none but people attached to the Marquis lived in or about the Abbey, who would immediately betray me to him, and if he ever detected &s;uch a &s;tep, it was his determination to hurry me to France.</P>
<P>Certain that he would be capable of &s;uch ba&s;ene&s;s, touched by the &s;malle&s;t indulgence, and eager to pro|cure any recreation, I gave her the mo&s;t &s;olemn a&s;&s;ur|ances of never attempting to make known my &s;ituation.

<P>The will I &s;hall deliver to you to-night: I advi&s;e you, if your brother cannot immediately be found, to put it into the hands of &s;ome man, on who&s;e abilities and in|tegrity you can rely; but till you meet with &s;uch a per|&s;on beware of di&s;covering you have it in your po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, le&s;t the Marquis, who, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, I believe capable of almo&s;t any ba&s;ene&s;s, &s;hould remove from your knowlege the penitent, who&s;e te&s;timony to the validity of the deed will &s;o cheerfully be given, and is &s;o mate|rially e&s;&s;ential: Be &s;ecret then, I again conjure you, till

<P>THE emotions Amanda experienced from reading this narrative deeply affected but gradually &s;ub|&s;ided from her mind, leaving it only occupied by pity for the penitent Lady Dunreath, and plea&s;ure at the pro&s;pect of O&s;car's independence, a plea&s;ure &s;o pure, &s;o fervent, that it had power to &s;teal her from her &s;orrows, and when the recollection of them again returned, &s;he endeavoured to bani&s;h it by thinking of the nece&s;&s;ity there was for immediately adopting &s;ome plan for the di&s;clo&s;ure of the will, Lady Dunreath had advi&s;ed her to put into the hands of a friend of integrity and abilities.</P>
<P>"But where," cried the di&s;con&s;olate Amanda, "can I find &s;uch a friend?" The few, the very few whom &s;he had rea&s;on to think regarded her, had neither power nor ability to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in what would probably be an ardu|ous demand for re&s;titution. After &s;itting a con&s;ider|able time in deep meditation, the idea of Ru&s;hbrook
<PB N="4" REF="038416_0575_1011E66CF4329838">
&s;uddenly occurred, and &s;he &s;tarted, as if in joyful &s;ur|pri&s;e at the remembrance, &s;he con&s;idered that, though almo&s;t a &s;tranger to him, an application of &s;uch a na|ture mu&s;t rather be regarded as a compliment than a liberty, from the great opinion it would prove &s;he had of his honour by intru&s;ting him with &s;uch a &s;ecret. From his looks and manner &s;he was convinced he would not only deeply feel for the injured, but ably advi&s;e how tho&s;e injuries &s;hould be redre&s;&s;ed. From his years and his &s;i|tuation there could be no impropriety in addre&s;&s;ing him, and &s;he already in imagination beheld him her friend, advocate, and advi&s;er: He al&s;o, &s;he tru&s;ted, would be able to put her in a way of making enquiries after O&s;|car. Oh! how delightful the pro&s;pect of di&s;covering that brother, of di&s;covering but to put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of even a &s;plendid independence. Ah! how &s;weet the idea of being again folded to a heart intere&s;ted in her welfare after &s;o long a &s;olitary mourner treading the rug|ged path of life, and bending as &s;he went beneath its adver&s;e &s;torm. Ah! how &s;weet again to meet an eye that &s;hould beam with tenderne&s;s on her's; an ear, which &s;hould li&s;ten with attentive rapture to her accents, and a voice that would &s;oothe with &s;ofte&s;t &s;ympathy her &s;orrows; it is only tho&s;e, who like her, have known the &s;ocial ties of life in all their &s;weetne&s;s, who like her have mourned their lo&s;s with all the bitterne&s;s of angui&s;h, that can po&s;&s;ibly conceive her feelings as the&s;e ideas oc|curred to her mind "Oh! O&s;car, oh! my brother," &s;he exclaimed, while tears wet her pale cheeks, "how rapturous the moment which re&s;tores you to me! How delightful to think our youth will no more experience the chill of poverty, your benevolence no longer &s;uffer re&s;traints! Now will your virtues &s;hine forth with full lu&s;tre&punc; dignifying the hou&s;e from which you have de|&s;cended, doing &s;ervice to your country, and &s;preading diffu&s;ive happine&s;s around.</P>
<P>The morning &s;urpri&s;ed Amanda in the mid&s;t of her meditations. She opened the &s;hutters, and hailed its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> glories in the ea&s;tern hemi&s;phere, the &s;un <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eams ex|haling the mi&s;ts of the valley di&s;played its &s;miling ver|dure,

forming a fine contra&s;t to the deep &s;hadows that yet partially enveloped the &s;urrounding mountains; the morning breeze gently agitated the old trees from who&s;e bending heads unnumbered birds aro&s;e, and in their ma|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">in notes &s;eemed to con&s;ecrate the fir&s;t return of day to the Great Author of Light and Life!</P>
<P>Spontaneous prai&s;e bur&s;t from the lips of Amanda, and &s;he felt all that calm and &s;weet delight which ever pervades a mind of religion and &s;en&s;ibility on viewing the rural beauties of nature; She left the charming &s;cene to try and get a little re&s;t, but &s;he thought not of un|dre&s;&s;ing; &s;he &s;oon &s;unk into a gentle &s;leep, and awoke with renovated &s;pirits near the breakfa&s;t hour.</P>
<P>Mrs. Bruce expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t regret at the nece&s;|&s;ity there was for parting with her gue&s;ts; but added, that &s;he believed, as well as hoped, their ab&s;ence from her would be but &s;hort, as &s;he was &s;ure the Marquis's family would leave Scotland almo&s;t immediately after Lady Euphra&s;ia's nuptials. In vain did Amanda &s;trug|gle for fortitude to &s;upport the mention of tho&s;e nup|tials; her frame trembled, her heart &s;ickened, whenever they were talked of; the &s;pirits &s;he had endeavoured to collect, from the idea that they would all be requi&s;ite in the important affair &s;he mu&s;t undertake, fleeted away at Mrs. Bruce's words, and a heavy langour took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her.</P>
<P>They did not leave the Abbey till after tea in the evening, and the idea that &s;he might &s;oon behold her brother, the acknowledged heir of that Abbey, ca&s;t again a gleam of plea&s;ure on the &s;ad heart of Amanda, a gleam I &s;ay, for it faded before the almo&s;t in&s;tanta|neous recollection, that ere that period Lord Mortimer and Lady Euphra&s;ia would be united; &s;unk in a pro|found melancholy, &s;he forgot her &s;ituation, heeded not the progre&s;s of the carriage, or remarked any object; a &s;udden jolt rou&s;ed her from her reverie, and &s;he blu&s;h|ed as &s;he thought of the &s;u&s;picions it might give ri&s;e to in the mind of Mrs. Duncan, who&s;e intelligent eye, on the preceding night, had more than half confe&s;&s;ed her knowledge of Amanda's feelings. She now, though
<PB N="6" REF="038416_0577_1011E6732D50C0F8">
with &s;ome embarra&s;&s;ment, attempted to enter into con|ver&s;ation, and Mrs. Duncan, who with deep attention had marked her pen&s;ive companion, with much cheerful|ne&s;s, rendered the attempt a &s;ucce&s;sful one. The chai&s;e was now turning from the valley, and Amanda leaned from her window to take another view of Dunreath Ab|bey. The &s;un was already &s;unk below the hori&s;on, but a tract of glory &s;till remained, that marked the &s;pot in which its daily cour&s;e was fini&s;hed, a dubious lu&s;tre yet played around the &s;pires of the Abbey, and while it di&s;played its va&s;t magnificence by contra&s;t added to its gloom, a gloom heightened by the dreary &s;olitude of its &s;ituation, for the valley was entirely over&s;hadowed by the dark projection of the mountains, on who&s;e &s;ummits a few bright and lingering beams yet remained, that &s;hewed the wild &s;hrubs waving in the evening breeze, a pen&s;ive &s;pirit &s;eemed now to have taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mrs. Dun|can, a &s;pirit congenial to the &s;cene, and the re&s;t of the little journey was pa&s;t almo&s;t in &s;ilence; their lodgings were at the entrance of the town, and Mrs. Bruce had taken care they &s;hould find every requi&s;ite refre&s;hment within them. The woman of the hou&s;e had already pre|pared a comfortable &s;upper for them, which was &s;erved up &s;oon after their arrival. When over, Mrs. Duncan, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Amanda, put the children to bed, as &s;he knew, till accu&s;tomed to her, they would not like the attendance of the maid of the hou&s;e. Neither &s;he or Amanda felt &s;leepy; it was a fine moon-light night, and they were tempted to walk out upon a terrace, to which a gla&s;s door from the room opened; the terrace overhung a deep valley which &s;tretched to the &s;ea, and the rocky pro|montory that terminated it was crowned with the ruins of an ancient ca&s;tle, the moon-beams &s;eemed to &s;leep upon its broken battlements, and the waves that &s;tole murmur|ing to the &s;hore ca&s;t a &s;ilvery &s;pray around it. A pen&s;ive plea&s;ure pervaded the hearts of Mrs. Duncan and Aman|da, and, conver&s;ing on the charms of the &s;cene, they walked up and down, when &s;uddenly upon the floating air they di&s;tingui&s;hed the &s;ound of a di&s;tant drum beat|ing the tattoo: both &s;topped, and leaned upon a frag|ment
<PB N="7" REF="038416_0578_1011E674C36FB708">
of a parapet wall, which had once &s;tretched along the terrace, and Mrs. Duncan, who knew the &s;ituation of the country, &s;aid, "that the &s;ounds they heard pro|ceeded from a fort near the town." They cea&s;ed in a &s;hort time, but were almo&s;t immediately &s;ucceeded by martial m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">c, and Amanda &s;oon di&s;tingui&s;hed an ad|mired march of her father's. Ah! how affectingly did it remind her of him. She recalled the moments in which &s;he had played it for him, whi&s;t he hung over her chair with delight and tenderne&s;s, &s;he wept at the tender remembrances it excited, wept at li&s;tening to &s;ounds which had &s;o often given to his pale cheek the flu&s;h of ardor.</P>
<P>They did not return to the hou&s;e till convinced, by a long interval of &s;ilence, that the mu&s;ic had cea&s;ed for the night.</P>
<P>Amanda having formed a plan relative to the will, determined not to delay executing it. She had often mentioned to Mrs. Duncan her unea&s;ine&s;s concerning her brother, as an excu&s;e for the melancholy that lady, in a half &s;erious, half je&s;ting manner, &s;o often rallied her about, and &s;he now intended to a&s;&s;ign her journey to London (which &s;he was re&s;olved &s;hould immediately take place) to her anxious wi&s;h of di&s;covering, or at lea&s;t inquiring about him; the next morning &s;he ac|cordingly mentioned her intention. Mrs. Duncan was not only &s;urpri&s;ed but concerned, and endeavoured to di&s;&s;uade her from it, by repre&s;enting, in the mo&s;t forci|ble manner, the dangers &s;he might experience in &s;o long a journey without a protector.</P>
<P>Amanda a&s;&s;ured her &s;he was already aware of the&s;e, but the apprehen&s;ions they excited were le&s;s painful than the anxiety &s;he &s;uffered on her brother's account, and ended by declaring her re&s;olution unalterable.</P>
<P>Mrs. Duncan, who in her heart could not blame A|manda for &s;uch a re&s;olution, now expre&s;&s;ed her hopes that &s;he would not make a longer &s;tay in London than was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, declaring that her &s;ociety would be a lo&s;s &s;he could &s;carcely &s;upport.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="038416_0579_1011E677AEEFBB58">
Amanda thanked her for her tenderne&s;s, and &s;aid, "&s;he hoped they &s;hould yet enjoy many happy days to|gether." She pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">o&s;ed travelling in a chai&s;e to the bor|ders of England, and then pur&s;uing the remainder of the journey in a &s;tage coach, the woman of the hou&s;e was &s;ent for, and reque&s;ted to engage a carriage for her again&s;t the morning, which &s;he promi&s;ed to do, and the intervening time was almo&s;t entirely pa&s;t by Mrs. Duncan in lamenting the approaching lo&s;s of Amanda's &s;ociety, and in entreaties for her to return as &s;oon as po&s;|&s;ible. Till this period &s;he did not know, nor did A|manda conceive, the &s;trength of her friend&s;hip. She pre&s;ented her pur&s;e to our heroine, and in the impa&s;&s;ion|ed language of &s;incerity, entreated her to con&s;ider it as the pur&s;e of a &s;i&s;ter, and take from it whatever was ne|ce&s;&s;ary for her long journey and uncertain &s;tay.</P>
<P>Amanda, who never wi&s;hed to lie under obligations when &s;he could po&s;&s;ibly avoid them, declined the offer; but, with the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude and &s;en|&s;ibility, declaring (what &s;he thought indeed would be the ca&s;e) that &s;he had more than &s;ufficient for all her purpo&s;es, all therefore &s;he would accept was what Mrs. Duncan owed her.</P>
<P>Mrs. Duncan begged her to take a letter from her to a family, near who&s;e hou&s;e her fir&s;t day's journey would terminate; they were relations of Mr. Duncan's &s;he &s;aid, and had been extremely kind to him and her; &s;he had kept up a corre&s;pondence with them till her removal to Dunreath Abbey, when &s;he dropped it, le&s;t her re&s;i|dence there &s;hould be di&s;covered; but &s;uch an opportuni|ty of writing to them, by a per&s;on who would an&s;wer all their inquiries concerning her, &s;he could not neglect; be&s;ides, &s;he continued, they were the mo&s;t agreeable and ho&s;pitable people &s;he had ever known, and &s;he was convinced would not &s;uffer Amanda to &s;leep at an inn, but would probably keep her a few days at their hou&s;e, and then e&s;cort her part of her way.</P>
<P>Aver&s;e to the &s;ociety of &s;trangers, in her pre&s;ent frame of mind, Amanda &s;aid &s;he would certainly take the letter, but could not po&s;&s;ibly pre&s;ent it her&s;elf. She
<PB N="9" REF="038416_0580_1011E67B406925F8">
thanked Mrs. Duncan for her &s;olicitous care about her; but added, whether &s;he lodged at an inn or private hou&s;e, for one night, was of little con&s;equence, and as to her journey being retarded, it was what &s;he never could allow.</P>
<P>Mrs. Duncan declared, "&s;he was too fond of &s;oli|tude, but did not argue the point with her; &s;he wrote the letter however."</P>
<P>They took leave of each other at night, as the chai&s;e was ordered at an early hour. As Mrs. Duncan folded Amanda to her heart, &s;he again be&s;ought her to ha&s;ten back, declaring, "that neither &s;he or her little girls would be them&s;elves till &s;he returned."</P>
<P>At an early hour Amanda entered the chai&s;e, and as &s;he &s;tepped into it, could not forbear ca&s;ting a &s;ad and lingering look upon a di&s;tant pro&s;pect, where the fore|going evening a du&s;ky grove of firs had pointed out to her, as encompa&s;&s;ing the Marquis of Ro&s;line's Ca&s;tle. Ah! how did her heart &s;icken at the idea of the event which either had or was &s;o &s;oon to take place in that Ca&s;tle! Ah! how did &s;he tremble at the idea of her long and lone&s;ome journey, and the difficulties &s;he might en|counter on its termination! How &s;ad, how &s;olitary, did &s;he feel her&s;elf, her mournful eyes filled with tears as &s;he &s;aw the ru&s;tic families ha&s;tening to their daily labours, for her mind involuntarily drew a compari&s;on between their &s;ituation and her own! And, ah! how &s;weet would their labour be to her, &s;he thought, if &s;he like them was encompa&s;&s;ed by the &s;ocial ties of life, fears before unthought of ro&s;e in her mind, from which her timid nature &s;hrunk appalled, &s;hould Ru&s;hbrook be ab|&s;ent from London, or &s;hould he not an&s;wer her expect|ations; but "I de&s;erve di&s;appointment," cried &s;he, "if I thus anticipate it. Oh! let me not be over exqui&s;ite
<Q><L>To ca&s;t the fa&s;hion of uncertain evils,"</L></Q>
oppre&s;&s;ed as I already am with real ones; &s;he endeavour|ed to exert her &s;pirits; &s;he tried to amu&s;e them by at|tending to the objects &s;he pa&s;t, and gradually they lo&s;t
<PB N="10" REF="038416_0581_1011E67EA66A1370">
&s;omewhat of their heavine&s;s. On arriving in London &s;he de&s;igned going to the haberda&s;her's, where it may be remembered &s;he had once met Mi&s;s Ru&s;hbrook; here &s;he hoped to procure lodgings, al&s;o a direction to Ru&s;h|brook. It was about five when they &s;topped for the night, as the &s;hortened days of autumn would not per|mit a longer journey, had the tired hor&s;es, which was not the ca&s;e, been able to proceed. They &s;topped at the inn, which Mrs. Duncan had taken care to know would be the la&s;t &s;tage of the fir&s;t day's journey, a &s;mall but neat and comfortable hou&s;e, romantically &s;ituated at the foot of a &s;teep hill, planted with ancient firs, and crowned with the &s;traggling remains of what appeared to have been a religious hou&s;e, from a &s;mall cro&s;s which yet &s;tood over a broken gateway; a &s;tream trickled from the hill, though its murmur through the thick under|wood alone denoted its ri&s;ing there, and winding round the inn, flowed in meanders through a &s;pacious vale, of which the inn was not the lone inhabitant, for cottages appeared on either &s;ide, and one large man&s;ion &s;tood in the centre, who&s;e &s;uperior &s;ize, and neat plantations, proclaimed it ma&s;ter of the whole. This was really the ca&s;e, for immediately on entering the inn, Amanda had enquired about the Macqueen family, to whom Mrs. Duncan's letter was directed, and learned that they in|habited this hou&s;e, and owned the grounds to a large extent &s;urrounding it. Amanda gave Mrs. Duncan's letter to the landlady, and begged &s;he would &s;end it di|rectly to Mrs. Macqueen. The inn was without com|pany, and its quiet retirement, together with the ap|pearance of the owners, an elderly pair, &s;oothed the agi|tated &s;pirits of Amanda. Her little dinner was &s;oon &s;erved up; but when over, and &s;he was left to her&s;elf, all the painful ideas &s;he had &s;o &s;edulou&s;ly, and with &s;ome degree of &s;ucce&s;s, attempted to bani&s;h from her mind in the morning by attending to the objects &s;he pa&s;&s;ed, now returned with full, or rather aggravated force. Books, tho&s;e plea&s;ing and, in affliction, alleviating re&s;ources, &s;he had forgotten to bring along with her, and all that the inn contained &s;he had been &s;hewn on a &s;helf in the
<PB N="11" REF="038416_0582_1011E68032B3A8F8">
apartment &s;he occupied, but without finding one that could po&s;&s;ibly fix her attention, or change its melancho|ly ideas; a ramble, though the evening was uninviting, &s;he preferred to the pa&s;&s;ive indulgence of her &s;orrow, and having ordered tea again&s;t her return, and invited the landlady to it, &s;he was conducted to the garden of the inn, from whence &s;he a&s;cended the hill by a winding path. She made her way with difficulty through a path which, &s;eldom trodden was half choaked with weeds and brambles; the wind blew cold and &s;harp around her, and the gloom of clo&s;ing day was heightened by thick and louring clouds, that involved the di&s;tant mountains in one dark &s;hade. Near tho&s;e mountains &s;he knew the domain of Ro&s;line lay, and from the bleak &s;ummit of the hill, &s;he &s;urveyed them as a lone mourner would &s;ur|vey the &s;ad &s;pot in which the plea&s;ure of his heart was buried; forgetting the purpo&s;e for which &s;he had walk|ed out, &s;he leaned in melancholy reverie again&s;t a frag|ment of the ruined building, nor heard approaching foot&s;teps, till the voice of her ho&s;t &s;uddenly broke upon her ear. She &s;tarted, and perceived him accompanied by two ladies, who he directly informed her were Mrs. and Mi&s;s Macqueen. They both went up to Amanda, and after the u&s;ual compliments of introduction were over, Mrs. Macqueen took her hand, and, with a &s;mile of cordial good nature, invited her to her hou&s;e for the night declaring that the plea&s;ure &s;he received from Mrs. Duncan's letter was heightened by being introdu|ced through its means to a per&s;on that lady mentioned as her particular friend. Mi&s;s Macqueen &s;econded her mother's invitation, and &s;aid, "the moment they had read the letter they had come out for the purpo&s;e of bringing her back with them."</P>
<P>"Aye, aye" &s;aid the ho&s;t good humouredly, (who was him&s;elf de&s;cended from one of the inferior branches of the Macqueen's) "this is the way, ladies, you always rob me of my gue&s;ts. In good faith I think I mu&s;t &s;oon me of my gue&s;ts. In good faith I think I mu&s;t &s;oon change my dwelling, and go higher up the valley."</P>
<P>Con&s;cious, from her utter dejection, that &s;he would be unable, as &s;he wi&s;hed to participate in the plea&s;ures
<PB N="12" REF="038416_0583_1011E6832B3BA080">
of conver&s;ation, Amanda declined the invitation, al|ledging as an excu&s;e for doing &s;o, her intention of pro|ceeding on her journey the next morning by dawn of day.</P>
<P>Mrs. Macqueen declared, that &s;he &s;hould act as &s;he plea&s;ed in that re&s;pect, and both &s;he and her daughter renewed their entreaties for her company with &s;uch ear|ne&s;tne&s;s, that Amanda could no longer refu&s;e them, and they returned to the inn, where Amanda begged they would excu&s;e her ab&s;ence a few minutes, and retired to pay her entertainers, and repeat her charges to the po&s;tilion to be at the hou&s;e as &s;oon as he &s;hould think any of the family &s;tirring. She then returned to the ladies, and attended them to their man&s;ion, which might well be termed the &s;eat of ho&s;pitality. The family con&s;i&s;ted of Mr. and Mrs. Macqueen, four &s;ons and &s;ix daughters, all now pa&s;t childhood, and united to one another by the &s;tricte&s;t ties of duty and affection. Af|ter re&s;iding a few years at Edenburgh for the improve|ment of the young people, Mr. and Mrs. Macqueen re|turned to their man&s;ion in the valley, where a large fortune was &s;pent in the enjoyment of agreeable &s;ociety and acts of benevolence. Mrs. Macqueen informed Amanda during the walk that all her family were now a&s;&s;embled together, as her &s;ons, who were already enga|ged in different profe&s;&s;ions and in bu&s;ine&s;s in various parts of the kingdom, made it a con&s;tant rule to pay a vi&s;it e|very autumn to their friends. It was quite dark before the ladies reached the hou&s;e, and the wind was &s;harp and cold, &s;o that Amanda found the light and warmth of the drawing room, to which &s;he was conducted extremely agreeable. The thick window curtains and carpeting, and the enlivening fire, bid defiance to the &s;harpne&s;s of the mountain bla&s;t which howled without, and rendered the comforts within more delectable by the effect of contra&s;t. In the drawing room were Mr. Macqueen, two of his daughters, and half a dozen ladies and gentlemen, to whom Amanda was pre&s;ented, and they in return to her. In the countenance of Mr. Macqueen, Amanda perceiv|ed a benevolence equal to that which irradiated his wife's. Both were pa&s;t the prime of life, but in him only was its
<PB N="13" REF="038416_0584_1011E684D6644CC0">
decline vi&s;ible. He was lately grown &s;o infirm as to be unable to remove without a&s;&s;i&s;tance, yet was his reli&s;h for &s;ociety undimini&s;hed, and in his arm chair, his legs muffled in flannel, and &s;upported by pillows, he promo|ted as much as ever the mirth of his family, and &s;aw with delight the dance go on in which he had once mixed with his children. Mrs. Macqueen appeared but as the elder &s;i&s;ter of her daughters, and between them all Amanda perceived a &s;trong family likene&s;s; they were tall, well, but not delicately made; hand&s;ome yet more indebted to the animation of their countenances than to regularity of features for beauty, which was rendered luxuriant by a quantity of rich auburn-hair, that unre|&s;trained by &s;uperfluous ornaments, fell in long ringlets on their &s;houlders, and curled with a &s;weet &s;implicity on their white poli&s;hed foreheads.</P>
<P>"So the boys and girls are not yet returned," &s;aid Mrs. Macqueen addre&s;&s;ing one of her daughters; "I am afraid they have taken their friends too far." She had &s;carcely &s;poken when a party was heard under the windows laughing and talking, who a&s;cended the &s;tairs immediately in a kind of gay tumult. The drawing|room door opened, and a lady entered (of a mo&s;t prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing appearance, though advanced in life) and was fol|lowed by a number of young people.</P>
<P>But, oh! what were the powerful emotions of Aman|das &s;oul, when among&s;t them &s;he beheld lady Aramin|ta Dormer and Lord Mortimer!&mdash;Shocked, confu&s;ed, confounded, &s;he &s;trained an eye of agony upon them, as if with the hope of detecting an illu&s;ion, then dropped her head, anxious to conceal her&s;elf, though &s;he was fa|tally convinced &s;he could be but a few minutes, unob|&s;erved by them. Never, amid&s;t the many trying mo|ments of her life, had &s;he experienced one more dreadful, to behold Lord Mortimer, when &s;he knew his e&s;teem for her was lo&s;t, at a period too when he was ha&s;tening to be united to another woman, oh! it was agony, torture in the extreme! vainly did &s;he reflect &s;he de&s;erved not to lo&s;e his e&s;teem. This con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s could not at pre&s;ent

in&s;pire her with fortitude; her heart throbbed as if it would bur&s;t, her bo&s;om, her frame trembled, and &s;he alternately experienced the glow of confu&s;ion and the chill of di&s;may&mdash;di&s;may at the idea of meeting the &s;i|lent, but expre&s;&s;ive reproach of Lord Mortimer's eye for her imaginary errors&mdash;di&s;may, at the idea of meet|ing the contempt of his aunt (who was the Lady that fir&s;t entered the room) and &s;i&s;ter.</P>

<P>BITTERLY did Amanda regret having been tempted from the inn, and gratefully would &s;he have acquitted fortune of half its malignancy to her, had &s;he been able to &s;teal back unnoticed, the party that en|tered engaged in talking to tho&s;e they found in the draw|ing-room (laughing and de&s;cribing their ramble, which Lady Araminta &s;aid was in the &s;tyle of Will-o'-the wi&s;p over breaks and through briars) were &s;ome time before they ob&s;erved Amanda; but &s;oon, ah! how much too &s;oon, did &s;he perceive Mrs. Macqueen approaching to introduce tho&s;e of her family, who were ju&s;t re|turned.</P>
<P>"The trying moment is come," cried Amanda, "oh! let me not by my confu&s;ion look as if I really was the guilty thing I am &s;uppo&s;ed to be." She endeavoured to collect her&s;elf, and ro&s;e to meet the young Macqueens,
<PB N="15" REF="038416_0586_1011E68ADDC37608">
by a timid glance perceiving that they yet hid her from the eyes &s;he mo&s;t dreaded to encounter: &s;he was unable however to return their compliments, except by a &s;aint &s;mile, and was again &s;inking upon her &s;eat, for her frame trembled univer&s;ally, when Mrs. Macqueen tak|ing her hand led her forward, and pre&s;ented her to La|dy Martha and Lady Araminta Dormer. It may be re|membered that Lady Martha had never before &s;een A|manda, &s;he therefore gave her, as Mi&s;s Donald, a be|nignant &s;mile, which had &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed her Mi&s;s Fitza|lan, would have been lo&s;t in a contemptuous frown; &s;eldom, indeed, had &s;he &s;een a form more intere&s;ting than our heroine's; her mourning habit &s;et off the ele|gance of her form, and the languid delicacy of her complexion, whil&s;t the &s;ad expre&s;&s;ion of her countenance denoted that habit but the &s;hadow of the un&s;een grief which dwelt within her &s;oul; her large blue eyes were half concealed by their long la&s;hes, but the beams that &s;tole from beneath tho&s;e fringed curtains were full of &s;weetne&s;s and &s;en&s;ibility; her fine hair, di&s;compo&s;ed by the jolting of the carriage and the blowing of the wind, had partly e&s;caped the braid on which it was turned un|der her hat, and hung in long ringlets of glo&s;&s;y brown upon her &s;houlders, and carele&s;s curls about her face, giving a &s;weet &s;implicity to it, which heightened its beauty. How different was the look &s;he received from Lady Araminta to that &s;he had received from Lady Martha! in the expre&s;&s;ive countenance of the former &s;he read &s;urpri&s;e, contempt and anger; her cheeks were flu&s;hed with unu&s;ual colour, her eyes &s;parkled with un|common lu&s;tre, and their quick glances pierced the pal|pitating heart of Amanda, who heard her repeat, as if involuntary, the name of Donald. Ah! how dreadful was the &s;ound to her ear!&mdash;Ah! how &s;ad a confirmation did it convey that every &s;u&s;picion to her prejudice would now be &s;trengthened!&mdash;Ah! why&mdash;why," &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf, "was I tempted to take this hated name? Why did I not prefer incurring any danger to which my own might have expo&s;ed me, rather than a&s;&s;ume any thing like deceit?" happily the party were too much en|gro&s;&s;ed
<PB N="16" REF="038416_0587_1011E68D4A386CB0">
by one another to heed the words or manner of Lady Araminta.</P>
<P>Amanda withdrew her hand from Mrs. Macqueen, and moved tremblingly to her &s;eat; but that Lady, with a politene&s;s poor Amanda had rea&s;on to think officious, &s;topped her.&mdash;"Mi&s;s Donald&mdash;Lord Mortimer!" &s;aid &s;he. Amanda rai&s;ed her head, but not her eyes, and neither &s;aw or heard his Lord&s;hip. The &s;cene &s;he had dreaded was over, and &s;he felt a little relieved at the idea. The haughty glance of Lady Araminta dwelt upon her mind, and when her agitation had a little &s;ub|&s;ided, &s;he &s;tole a look at her, and &s;aw Mrs. Macqueen &s;itting between her and Lady Martha, and from the al|tered countenance of the latter, &s;he in&s;tantly conjectur|ed &s;he had been informed by her niece of her real name. She al&s;o conjectured, from the glances directed towards her, that &s;he was the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation, and con|cluded it was begun for the purpo&s;e of di&s;covering whether Mrs. Macqueen knew any thing of her real hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>From the&s;e glances &s;he quickly withdrew her own, and one of the young Macqueens drawing a chair near her's, began a conver&s;ation with all that &s;pirit and viva|city which di&s;tingui&s;hed his family. The mind of A|manda was too much occupied by its own concerns to be able to attend to any thing foreign to them; &s;he &s;carcely knew what he &s;aid, and when &s;he did reply, it was only by mono&s;yllables. At la&s;t a que&s;tion, enforced with pe|culiar earne&s;tne&s;s, rou&s;ed her from this inattention, and blu&s;hing for it, &s;he looked at the young man, and per|ceived him regarding her with &s;omething like wonder, &s;he now, for the fir&s;t time, con&s;idered the &s;trange ap|pearance &s;he mu&s;t make among&s;t the company, if &s;he did not collect and compo&s;e her &s;pirits. The family too, to whom &s;he was (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he could not help thinking) &s;o unfor|tunately introduced, from their ho&s;pitality, merited at|tention and re&s;pect from her; &s;he re&s;olved therefore, to &s;truggle with her feelings, and, as an apology for her ab&s;ent manner, complained, and not without truth, of a head-ache.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="038416_0588_1011E690ECAEF318">
Young Macqueen, with a friendly warmth, &s;aid he would acquaint his mother, or one of his &s;i&s;ters, with her indi&s;po&s;ition, and procure &s;ome remedy for it; but &s;he in&s;i&s;ted he &s;hould on no account di&s;turb the com|pany, a&s;&s;uring him &s;he would &s;oon be well: She then endeavoured to &s;upport a conver&s;ation with him; but ah! how often did &s;he pau&s;e in the mid&s;t of what &s;he was &s;aying, as the &s;weet in&s;inuating voice of Mortimer reached her ear, who, with his native elegance and &s;pi|rit, was participating in the lively conver&s;ation then go|ing forward. In her's, with young Macqueen, &s;he was &s;oon interrupted by his father, who, in a good humoured manner, told his &s;on he would no longer &s;uffer him to engro&s;s Mi&s;s Donald to him&s;elf, and de&s;ired him to lead her to a chair near his.</P>
<P>Young Macqueen immediately aro&s;e, and taking Amanda's hand led her to his father, by whom he &s;eated her, and by whom, on the other &s;ide &s;at Lady Martha Dormer; then, with a mode&s;t gallantry, declared it was the fir&s;t time he ever felt reluctance to obey his father's commands, and hoped his ready acquie&s;cence to them would be rewarded with &s;peedy permi&s;&s;ion to re&s;ume his conver&s;ation with Mi&s;s Donald. Amanda had hitherto prevented her eyes from wandering, though they could not exclude the form of Lord Mortimer; &s;he had not yet &s;een his face, and &s;till &s;trove to avoid doing &s;o. Mr. Macqueen began with various inquiries relative to Mrs. Duncan, to which Amanda, as &s;he was prepared for them, an&s;wered with tolerable compo&s;ure. Suddenly he dropped the &s;ubject of his relation, and a&s;ked Aman|da "from what branch of the Donald's &s;he de&s;cended?" A que&s;tion &s;o unexpected, &s;hocked, di&s;mayed, and over|whelmed her with confu&s;ion.&mdash;She made no reply till the que&s;tion was repeated, when, in a low and faultering voice, her face covered with blu&s;hes, and almo&s;t buried in her bo&s;om &s;he &s;aid, &s;he did not know."</P>
<P>"Well," cried he again changing his di&s;cour&s;e, after looking at her a few minutes, "I did not know any girl but your&s;elf would take &s;uch pains to hide &s;uch a pair of eyes as you have; I &s;uppo&s;e you are con&s;cious
<PB N="18" REF="038416_0589_1011E69387A01660">
of the mi&s;chief they have the power of doing, and there|fore it is from compa&s;&s;ion to mankind you try to conceal them.</P>
<P>Amanda blu&s;hed yet more deeply than before at find|ing her down ca&s;t looks were noticed. She turned her's with quickne&s;s to Mr. Macqueen, who having an&s;wer|ed a que&s;tion of Lady Martha's thus proceeded: "And &s;o you do not know from which branch of the Donald's you are de&s;cended? Perhaps now you only forget, and if I was to mention them one by one your memory might be refre&s;hed; but fir&s;t let me a&s;k your father's &s;ir-name, and what country-woman he married, for the Donalds generally marry among&s;t each other?"</P>
<P>Oh! how forcibly was Amanda at this moment con|vinced (if indeed her pure &s;oul wanted &s;uch conviction) of the pain, the &s;hame of deception, let the motive be what it may which prompts it. Involuntarily were her eyes turned from Mr. Macqueen as he pau&s;ed for a reply to his la&s;t que&s;tion, and at the moment encounter|ed tho&s;e of Lord Mortimer, who &s;at directly oppo&s;ite to her, and with deep attention regarded her, as if anxious to hear how &s;he would extricate her&s;elf from the embar|ra&s;&s;ment her a&s;&s;umed name had plunged her into.</P>
<P>Her confu&s;ion, her blu&s;hes, her too evident di&s;tre&s;s, were all imputed by Mrs. Macqueen to fatigue at li&s;tening to &s;uch tedious enquiries; &s;he knew her hu&s;|band's only foible was an eager de&s;ire to trace every one's pedigree; in order therefore to relieve Amanda from her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, &s;he propo&s;ed a party of whil&s;t at which Mr. Macqueen often amu&s;ed him&s;elf, and for which the table and cards were already laid before him. As &s;he took up the cards, to hand them to tho&s;e who were to draw, &s;he whi&s;pered Amanda to go over to the tea-table.</P>
<P>Amanda required no repetition now, and thanking Mrs. Macqueen in her heart for the relief&punc; &s;he afforded her, went to the table around which almo&s;t all the young people were crowded; &s;o great was the mirth going on among&s;t them, that Mi&s;s Macqueen, the grave&s;t of the &s;et, in vain called upon her &s;i&s;ters to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in &s;erving

the trays, which the &s;ervants handed about, and Mrs. Macqueen had more than once called for; Mi&s;s Mac|queen made room for Amanda by her&s;elf, and A|manda anxious to do any thing which could keep her from encountering the eyes &s;he dreaded, reque&s;ted to be employed in a&s;&s;i&s;ting her, and was deputed to fill out the coffee. After the fir&s;t performance of her ta&s;k, Mi&s;s Macqueen, in a whi&s;pering voice, &s;aid to Aman|da, "Do you know we are all here more than half in love with Lord Mortimer; he is certainly very hand|&s;ome, and his manner is quite as plea&s;ing as his looks, for he has none of that foppery and conceit which hand|&s;ome men &s;o generally have, and nothing but the know|ledge of his engagement could keep us from pulling caps about him. You have heard to be &s;ure of Lady Eu|phra&s;ia Sutherland, the Marquis of Ro&s;line's daughter; well, he is going to be married to her immediately. She and the Marquis and the Marchione&s;s were here the other day; &s;he is not to be compared to Lord Mortimer, but &s;he has what will make her be con&s;idered very hand|&s;ome in the eyes of many, namely, a large fortune. They only &s;topped to breakfa&s;t here, and ever &s;ince we have been on the watch for the re&s;t of the party, who arrived this morning and were on Lady Martha's account, whom the journey has fatigued, prevailed to &s;tay, till to-mor|row. I am very glad you came while they were here: I think both Ladies charming women, and Lady Ara|minta quite as hand&s;ome as her brother: but &s;ee," &s;he continued touching Amanda's hand, "the conquering hero comes." Lord Mortimer with difficulty made his way round the table, and accepted a &s;eat from Mi&s;s Macqueen, which &s;he eagerly offered him, and which &s;he contrived to procure by &s;itting clo&s;er to Amanda. To her next neighbour, a fine lively girl, Amanda now turned, and entered into conver&s;ation with her; but from this &s;he was &s;oon called by Mi&s;s Macqueen reque&s;ting her to pour out a cup of coffee for Lord Mortimer.</P>
<P>Amanda obeyed, and he aro&s;e to receive it; her hand trembled as &s;he pre&s;ented it. She looked not in his face, but &s;he thought his hand was not quite &s;teady. She

&s;aw him lay the cup on the table, and bend his eyes to the ground. She heard Mi&s;s Macqueen addre&s;s him twice ere &s;he received an an&s;wer, and then it was &s;o ab|rupt that it &s;eemed the effect of &s;udden recollection. Mi&s;s Macqueen grew almo&s;t as inattentive to the table as her &s;i&s;ters, and Mrs. Macqueen was obliged to come over to know what they were all about. At length the bu&s;ine&s;s of the tea-table was declared over, and almo&s;t at the &s;ame moment the &s;ound of a violin was heard from an adjoining room, playing an Engli&s;h country dance, in which &s;tile of dancing the Macqueens had been in&s;tructed in Edinburgh, and cho&s;e this evening in com|pliance to their gue&s;ts. The mu&s;ic was a &s;ignal for uni|ver&s;al motion; all in a moment was bu&s;tle and gay con|fu&s;ion. The young men in&s;tantly &s;elected their part|ners, who &s;eemed ready to dance from one room to ano|ther. The young Macqueen, who had been &s;o a&s;&s;idu|ous about Amanda, now came, and taking her hand, as if her dancing was a thing of cour&s;e, was leading her after the re&s;t of the party, when &s;he drew back, declar|ing &s;he could not dance. Surpri&s;ed and di&s;appointed, he &s;tood looking on her in &s;ilence, as if irre&s;olute whether he &s;hould not attempt to change her re&s;olution. At la&s;t he &s;poke, and reque&s;ted &s;he would not mortify him by a refu&s;al.</P>

<P>"Do, my dear," &s;aid Mrs. Macqueen, "try one dance, my girls will tell you dancing is a &s;overeign rem|edy for every thing." It was painful to Amanda to re|fu&s;e; but &s;carcely able to &s;tand &s;he was utterly unable to dance; had even her &s;trength permitted her to do &s;o, &s;he could not have &s;upported the idea of mingling in the &s;et with Lord Mortimer, the glance of who&s;e eye &s;he never caught without a throb in her heart, which &s;hook her whole frame. One of the Mi&s;s Macqueens now ran into the room, exclaiming, "Lord, Collin, what are you about? Lord Mortimer and my &s;i&s;ter have al|ready led off; do pray make ha&s;te and join us," and away &s;he ran again.</P>

"Let me no longer detain you," &s;aid Amanda, with|drawing her hand&mdash;Young Macqueen finding her in|flexible, at length went off to &s;eek a partner. He was as fond of dancing as his &s;i&s;ters, and feared he &s;hould not procure one; but luckily there were fewer gentlemen than Ladies pre&s;ent, and a Lady having &s;tood up with his younge&s;t &s;i&s;ter, he ea&s;ily prevailed on her to change her partner.</P>
<P>"We will go into the dancing-room, if you plea&s;e," &s;aid Mrs. Macqueen to Amanda, "that will amu&s;e without fatiguing you."&mdash;Amanda would rather have not gone, but &s;he could not &s;ay &s;o, and they proceeded to it. Lord Mortimer had ju&s;t concluded the dance, and was &s;tanding near the door in a pen&s;ive attitude, Mi&s;s Macqueen being too much engro&s;&s;ed by &s;omething &s;he was &s;aying to the young Lady next to her to mind him. The moment he perceived Amanda enter, he again approached his partner, and began chatting in a lively manner to her.&mdash;Amanda and Mrs. Macqueen &s;at down together, and in li&s;tening to the conver&s;ation of that Lady, Amanda found her&s;elf in&s;en&s;ibly drawn from a too painful attention to &s;urrounding objects. On expre&s;&s;ing the plea&s;ure which a mind of &s;en&s;ibility mu&s;t feel on witne&s;&s;ing &s;uch family happine&s;s as Mrs. Mac|queen po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, that lady, &s;aid, "&s;he had rea&s;on in|deed to be grateful to heven, and was truly &s;o for her dome&s;tice comforts. You &s;ee us now (&s;he continued) in our gaye&s;t &s;ea&s;on becau&s;e of my &s;on's company; but we are &s;eldom dull; though &s;ummer is delightful, we never think the winter tedious; yet though we love amu&s;ement, I a&s;&s;ure you, we di&s;like di&s;&s;ipation; the mornings are appropriated to bu&s;ine&s;s, and the evenings to recreation; all the work of the family goes through the hands of my daughters, and they wear nothing orna|mental which they do not make them&s;elves; a&s;&s;i&s;ted by their good neighbours they are enabled to diver&s;ify their amu&s;ements; the dance &s;ucceeds the concert, &s;ome|times &s;mall plays, and now and then little dramatic en|tertainments. About two years ago they perform|ed

the Winter's Tale; their poor father was not then in his pre&s;ent &s;ituation. Mrs. Macqueen &s;ighed, pau&s;ed a minute and then proceeded; "time mu&s;t take &s;omething from us; but I &s;hould and do ble&s;s, with heart-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">elt gratitude, the power which only by its &s;tealing hand has made me feel the lot of human nature.&mdash;Mr. Macqueen (continued &s;he) at the time I mentioned was full of &s;pirits, and performed the part of Antolicus.

On the&s;e occa&s;ions one of my &s;ons leads the band, another paints the &s;cene, and Colin, your rejected partner, acts the part of Prompter." Here this conver&s;ation, &s;o plea&s;ing to Amanda, and intere&s;ting to Mrs. Macqueen, was in|terrupted by a me&s;&s;age from the drawing room, to in|form the latter the rubber was over, and a new &s;et want|ed to cut in.</P>
<P>I will return as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible," &s;aid Mrs. Mac|queen, as &s;he was quitting her &s;eat. If Amanda had not dreaded the looks of Lady Martha almo&s;t as much as tho&s;e of Lord Mortimer or Lady Araminta, &s;he would have followed her to the drawing-room. As this was the ca&s;e &s;he re&s;olved on remaining in her pre&s;ent &s;itua|tion; it was &s;ome time ere &s;he was ob&s;erved by the young Macqueens. At la&s;t Mi&s;s Macqueen came over to her: "I declare," &s;aid &s;he, "you look &s;o &s;ad and &s;olitary, I wi&s;h you could be prevailed upon to dance; do try this, it is a very fine lively one, and take Flora for your partner, who you &s;ee has &s;at in a corner quite di&s;|compo&s;ed &s;ince &s;he lo&s;t her partner, and by the next &s;et Colin will be di&s;engaged."</P>
<P>Amanda declared &s;he could not dance, and Mi&s;s Mac|queen being called to her place at the in&s;tant, &s;he was again left to her&s;elf: Mi&s;s Macqueen, however, conti|nued
<PB N="23" REF="038416_0594_1011E69F6CFDD668">
to come and chat with her, whenever &s;he could do &s;o without lo&s;ing any part of the dance. At la&s;t Lord Mortimer followed her. The eyes of Amanda were involuntarily bent to the ground when &s;he &s;aw him ap|proach: "You are an ab&s;olute runaway," cried he to Mi&s;s Macqueen, "how do you &s;uppo&s;e I will excu&s;e your frequent de&s;ertions?"</P>
<P>"Why, Mi&s;s Donald is &s;o lone&s;ome," &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>"See," cried he, with quickne&s;s, "your &s;i&s;ter beck|ons you to her; &s;uffer me (taking her hand) to lead you to her."</P>
<P>Amanda looked up as they moved from her, and &s;aw Lord Mortimer's head half turned back; but the in&s;tant &s;he perceived him he averted it, and took no farther no|tice of her. When the &s;et was fini&s;hed Mi&s;s Macqueen returned to Amanda, and was followed by &s;ome of her brothers and &s;i&s;ters: &s;ome of the gentlemen al&s;o ap|proached Amanda, and reque&s;ted the honour of her hand, but &s;he was &s;teady in refu&s;ing all. Rich wines, &s;weetmeats, and warm lemonade, were now handed about in profu&s;ion, and the &s;trains of the violin were &s;ucceeded by tho&s;e of the bagpipe, played by the family mu&s;ician, venerable in his appearance, and habited in the ancient Highland dre&s;s; with as much &s;atisfaction to him&s;elf as his Scotch auditors, he played a lively Scotch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eel, which in a moment brought two of the Mi&s;s Macqueens and two gentlemen forward, and they continued this dance till politene&s;s induced them to &s;top, that one might be begun in which the re&s;t of the party could join. Dancing continued in this manner with lit|tle intermi&s;&s;ion, but whenever there was an interval the young Macqueens paid every attention to Amanda, and on her expre&s;&s;ing her admiration of the Scotch mu&s;ic, made it a point that &s;he &s;hould mention &s;ome favourite airs that they might be played for her: but the&s;e airs, the lively dances, the animated conver&s;ation, and the friendly attentions paid her, could not remove her dejec|tion, and with truth they might have &s;aid,

<PB N="24" REF="038416_0595_1011E6A33203E0F8">
The entrance of Mrs. Macqueen was the &s;ignal for the dance being ended. She made the young people &s;it down to refre&s;h them&s;elves before &s;upper, and apologized to Amanda for not returning to her; but &s;aid Lady Martha Dormer had engaged her in a conver&s;ation which &s;he could not interrupt. At la&s;t they were &s;um|moned to &s;upper, which, on Mr. Macqueen's account, was laid out in a room on the &s;ame floor; thither, with|out ceremony, whoever was next the door fir&s;t proceed|ed. Mr. Macqueen was already &s;eated at the table in his arm chair, and Lady Martha Dormer on his right hand; the elde&s;t &s;on was deputed to do the honours of the foot of the table; the company was chequered, and Amanda found her&s;elf &s;eated between Lord Mortimer and Mr. Colin Macqueen; and in conver&s;ing with the latter Amanda &s;ought to avoid noticing or being noticed by Lord Mortimer; and his Lord&s;hip, by the particular attention which he paid Mi&s;s Macqueen, who &s;at on his other &s;ide, appeared actuated by the &s;ame wi&s;h. The &s;ports of the morning had furni&s;hed the table with a variety of the choice&s;t wild fowl, and the plenty and beauty of the confectionary denoted at once the ho&s;pita|ble &s;pirit and elegant ta&s;te of the mi&s;tre&s;s of the fea&s;t; gaiety pre&s;ided at the board, and there was &s;carcely a tongue, except Amanda's which did not utter &s;ome lively &s;ally; the piper &s;at in the lobby, and if his &s;trains were not melodious, they were at lea&s;t cheerful. In the cour&s;e of the &s;upper Lord Mortimer was compel|led to follow the univer&s;al example of drinking Amanda's health; obliged to turn her looks to him, oh! how did her heart &s;hrink at the glance, the expre&s;&s;ive glance of his eye, as he pronounced Mi&s;s Donald; uncon&s;cious whether &s;he had noticed in the u&s;ual manner his di&s;tre&s;&s;|ing compliment, &s;he abruptly turned to young Mac|queen, and addre&s;&s;ed &s;ome &s;carcely articulate que&s;tion to him. The &s;upper things removed, the &s;trains of the piper were &s;ilenced, and toa&s;ts, &s;ongs, and &s;entiments &s;ucceeded. Old Mr. Macqueen &s;et the example by a favourite Scotch air, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n called upon his next neighbour. Between the longs toa&s;ts were called for.
<PB N="25" REF="038416_0596_1011E6A53B3ECF20">
At la&s;t it came to Lord Mortimer's turn. Amanda &s;uddenly cea&s;ed &s;peaking to young Macqueen. She &s;aw the gla&s;s of Lord Mortimer filled, and in the next moment heard the name of Lady Euphra&s;ia Sutherland. A feeling, like wounded pride, &s;tole into the &s;oul of A|manda: &s;he did not decline her head as before, and &s;he felt a faint glow upon her cheek. The eyes of Lady Martha and Lady Araminta &s;he thought directed to her with an expre&s;&s;ive meaning. "They think," cried &s;he, "to witne&s;s mortification and di&s;appointment in my looks, but they &s;hall not (if indeed they are capa|ble of enjoying &s;uch a triumph) have it.</P>
<P>At length &s;he was called upon for a &s;ong. She de|clined the call; but Mr. Macqueen declared, except a&s;&s;ured &s;he could not &s;ing, &s;he &s;hould not be excu&s;ed. This a&s;&s;urance, without a breach of truth, &s;he could not give; &s;he did not wi&s;h to appear ungrateful to her kind entertainers, or un&s;ocial, in the mid&s;t of mirth, by refu&s;ing what &s;he was told would be plea&s;ing to them and their company; She al&s;o wi&s;hed, from a &s;ud|den impul&s;e of pride, to appear cheerful in tho&s;e eyes, &s;he knew were attentively ob&s;erving her, and therefore, after a little he&s;itation, con&s;ented to &s;ing. The fir&s;t &s;ong which occurred to her was a little &s;imple but pa|thetic air, which her father u&s;ed to delight in, and which Lord Mortimer more than once had heard from her; but indeed &s;he could recollect no &s;ong which at &s;ome time or other &s;he had not &s;ung for him. The &s;imple air &s;he had cho&s;en &s;eemed perfectly adapted to her &s;oft voice, who&s;e modulations were inexpre&s;&s;ibly affecting. She had proceeded through half the &s;econd ver&s;e when her voice began to faulter; the attention of the company became if po&s;&s;ible more fixed; but it was a vain at|tention, no rich &s;train of melody repaid it for the voice of the &s;ong&s;tre&s;s had totally cea&s;ed. Mrs. Macqueen, with the delicacy of a &s;u&s;ceptible mind, feared increa&s;|ing her emotion by noticing it, and, with a glance of her expre&s;&s;ive eye, directed her company to &s;ilence. A|manda's eyes were bent to the ground. Suddenly a gla&s;s
<PB N="26" REF="038416_0597_1011E6A7A8A0B9F0">
of water was pre&s;ented to her by a trembling hand, by the hand of Mortimer him&s;elf. She declined it with a motion of her's, and reviving a little rai&s;ed her head. Young Macqueen then gave her an entreating whi&s;per to fini&s;h her &s;ong; &s;he thought it would look like affec|tation to require farther &s;olicitation, and, faintly &s;miling again began in &s;trains of liquid melody, &s;trains that &s;eemed to breathe the very &s;pirit of &s;en&s;ibility, and came over each attentive ear,
<Q><L>Like a &s;weet &s;ound</L>
<L>That breathes upon a bank of violets,</L>
<L>Stealing and giving odour.</L></Q></P>
<P>The plaudits &s;he received for her &s;inging gave to her cheeks &s;uch a &s;aint tinge of read, as is &s;een in the bo&s;om of the wild ro&s;e. She was now authorized to call for a &s;ong, and, as if doomed to experience cau&s;e for agitation, Lord Mortimer was the per&s;on from whom in the rota|tion of the table, &s;he was to claim it. Thrice &s;he was reque&s;ted to do this ere &s;he could obey. At la&s;t &s;he rai&s;ed her eyes to his face, which was now turned to|wards her, and &s;he &s;aw in it a confu&s;ion equal to that &s;he her&s;elf trembled under. Pale and red by turns he appeared to her to wait in painful agitation for the &s;ound of her voice; her lips moved, but &s;he could not articu|late a word. Lord Mortimer bowed, as if he had heard what they would have &s;aid, and then turning abruptly to Mi&s;s Macqueen began &s;peaking to her.</P>
<P>"Come, come, my Lord," &s;aid Mr. Macqueen, "we mu&s;t not be put off in this manner."</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer laughed, and attempted to rally the old gentleman; but he &s;eemed unequal to the attempt, for with a &s;udden &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s he declared his inability of comply|ing with the pre&s;ent demand; all further &s;olicitation on the &s;ubject was immediately dropped. In the round of toa&s;ts they forgot not to call upon Amanda for one, if &s;he had li&s;tened attentively when Lord Mortimer was about giving one, no le&s;s attentively then did he now li&s;|ten to her. She he&s;itated a moment, and then gave Sir Charles Bingley, After the toa&s;t had pa&s;&s;ed, Sir Charles
<PB N="27" REF="038416_0598_1011E6AA2274FBE0">
Bingley, repeated Mi&s;s Macqueen, leaning forward, and &s;peaking acro&s;s Lord Mortimer. Oh! I recollect him very well his regiment was quartered &s;ome years ago at a little fort &s;ome di&s;tance from this, and I remember his coming with a &s;hooting party to the mountains, and &s;leeping one night here; we had a delightful dance that evening, and all thought him a charming young man.</P>
<P>"Pray, are you well acquainted with him?"</P>
<P>"Yes&mdash;No"&mdash;replied Amanda.</P>
<P>"Ah! I believe you are a &s;ly girl," cried Mi&s;s Mac|queen, laughing. "Pray, my Lord, does not that blu&s;h declare Mi&s;s Donald guilty?"</P>
<P>"We are not always to judge from the countenance," &s;aid he, darting a penetrating, yet quickly withdrawn glance at Amanda. "Experience," continued he, "dai|ly proves how little dependence is to be placed on it." Amanda turned ha&s;tily away, and pretended, by &s;peak|ing to young Macqueen, not to notice a &s;peech &s;he knew directly pointed at her; for often had Lord Morti|mer declared, that "in the lineaments of the human face divine, each pa&s;&s;ion of the &s;oul might well be traced."</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Macqueen laughed, and &s;aid, "&s;he always judg|ed of the countenance, and that her likings and di&s;lik|ings were always the effect of fir&s;t &s;ight."</P>
<P>The company broke up &s;oon after this, and much earlier than the u&s;ual hour, on account of the travel|lers: All but tho&s;e then immediately belonging to the family having departed, &s;ome maids of the hou&s;e ap|peared to &s;hew the ladies to their re&s;pective chambers. Lady Martha and Araminta retired fir&s;t: Amanda was following them, when Mrs. Macqueen detained her to try and prevail on her to &s;tay two or three days along with them. The Mi&s;s Macqueens joined their mother, but Amanda a&s;&s;ured them &s;he could not comply with their reque&s;t, though &s;he felt with gratitude its friendly warmth. Old Mr. Macqueen had his chair turned to the fire, and his &s;ons and Lord Mortimer was &s;urrounding it. "Well, well," &s;aid he, calling Amanda to him and taking her hand, "if you will not &s;tay with us now, remember on your return we &s;hall lay an embargo on you; in the
<PB N="28" REF="038416_0599_1011E6ACAF0F5918">
mean time I &s;hall not lo&s;e the privilege, which my being an old married man gives me." So &s;aying, he gently pulled Amanda to him, and ki&s;&s;ed her cheek. She could only &s;mile at this innocent freedom, but &s;he attempted to withdraw her hand to retire. Now," &s;aid Mr. Macqueen &s;till detaining it, "are all the&s;e young men half mad with envy!" The young Macqueens joined in their father's gallantry, and not a tongue was &s;ilent ex|cept Lord Mortimer's his head re&s;ted on his hand, and the cornice of the chimney &s;upported his arm; his hair, from which the dancing had almo&s;t &s;haken all the pow|der, hung negligently about his face, adding to its pale|ne&s;s and &s;udden dejection. One of the young Mac|queens turning from his brothers, who were yet continu|ing their mirth with their father, addre&s;&s;ed &s;ome que&s;|tion to his Lord&s;hip, but received no an&s;wer. Again he repeated it. Lord Mortimer then &s;uddenly &s;tarted, as if from a profound reverie, and apologized for his ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>"Ay, ay, my Lord," exclaimed old Mr. Macqueen, joco&s;ely, "we may all gue&s;s where your Lord&s;hip was then travelling in idea&mdash;a little beyond the mountains I fancy; ay, we all know where your heart and your trea&s;ure now lie."</P>
<P>"Do you?" &s;aid Lord Mortimer, with a tone of deep dejection, and a heavy &s;igh, with an air al&s;o which &s;eem|ed to declare him &s;carcely con&s;cious of what he &s;aid: He recollected him&s;elf, however, at the in&s;tant, and be|gan rallying him&s;elf as the &s;ure&s;t means of preventing others doing &s;o. The &s;cene was too painful to Amanda; &s;he ha&s;tily withdrew her hand, and faintly wi&s;hing the party a good night, went out to the maid, who was waiting for her in the lobby, and was conducted to her room. She di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the &s;ervant at the door, and throw|ing her&s;elf into a chair, availed her&s;elf of &s;olitude to give vent to the tears, who&s;e painful &s;uppre&s;&s;ion had &s;o long tortured her heart. She had not &s;at long in this &s;ituation, when &s;he heard a gentle tap at the door She &s;tarted, and believing it to be one of the Mi&s;s Mac|queens, ha&s;tily wiped away the tears, and opened the
<PB N="29" REF="038416_0600_1011E6B0987AE438">
door. A female &s;tranger appeared at it, who curte|&s;ying re&s;pectfully, &s;aid, "Lady Martha Dormer, her Lady, de&s;ired to &s;ee Mi&s;s Donald for a few minutes, if not inconvenient to her."</P>
<P>"See me!" repeated Amanda, with the utmo&s;t &s;ur|pri&s;e, "can it be po&s;&s;ible!" She &s;uddenly checked her&s;elf, and &s;aid, "&s;he would attend her Lady&s;hip im|mediately." She accordingly followed the maid, a va|riety of &s;trange ideas crowding upon her mind. Her conductre&s;s retired as &s;he &s;hut the door of the room into which &s;he &s;hewed Amanda; it was a &s;mall anti-chamber adjoining the apartment Lady Martha was to lie in. Here with increa&s;ing &s;urpri&s;e &s;he beheld Lord Mortimer, pacing the room in an agitated manner. His back was to the door as &s;he entered, but he turned round with quickne&s;s, approached, looked on her for a few minutes, then &s;triking his hand &s;uddenly again&s;t his fore-head, turned from her with an air of di&s;traction.</P>
<P>Lady Martha, who was &s;itting at the head of the room, and only bowed as Amanda entered it, motioned for her to take a chair; a motion Amanda gladly obeyed, for her trembling limbs could &s;carcely &s;upport her.</P>
<P>All was &s;ilent for a few minutes, Lady Martha then &s;poke in a grave voice:&mdash;"I &s;hould not Madam, have taken the liberty of &s;ending for you at this hour, but that I believed &s;o favourable an opportunity would not again have occurred of &s;peaking to you, on a &s;ubject particulary intere&s;ting to me&mdash;an opportunity which has &s;o unexpectedly &s;aved me the trouble of trying to find you out, and the nece&s;&s;ity of writing to you."</P>
<P>Lady Martha pau&s;ed, and her &s;ilence was not inter|rupted by Amanda.&mdash;"La&s;t &s;ummer," continued Lady Martha&mdash;again &s;he pau&s;ed&mdash;the throbbings of Aman|da's heart became more violent. La&s;t &s;ummer, &s;aid &s;he again, "there were &s;ome little gifts pre&s;ented to you by Lord Mortimer; from the events, which followed their acceptance, I mu&s;t pre&s;ume they are valuele&s;s to you; from the events about taking place they are of
<PB N="30" REF="038416_0601_1011E6B222FC8EE8">
importance el&s;ewhere." She cea&s;ed, but Amanda could make no reply.</P>
<P>"You cannot be ignorant," &s;aid Lady Martha, with &s;omething of &s;everity in her accent, as if offended by the &s;ilence of Amanda, "you cannot be ignorant, I &s;uppo&s;e, that it is the picture and ring I allude to; the latter from being a family one of particular value, I always de&s;tined for the wife of Lord Mortimer, I therefore claim it in my own name. The picture I have his Lord&s;hip's ap|probation and authority to demand, and to convince you I have, indeed if &s;uch a conviction be nece&s;&s;ary, have prevailed on him to be pre&s;ent at this conver&s;ation."</P>
<P>"No, Madam, &s;uch a conviction was not nece&s;&s;ary," cried Amanda&mdash;"I &s;hould&mdash;." She could utter no more at the moment, yet tried to &s;uppre&s;s the agoniz|ing feelings that tumultuou&s;ly heaved her bo&s;om.</P>
<P>"If not convenient to re&s;tore them immediately," &s;aid Lady Martha, "I will give you a direction where they may be left in London, to which place Mrs. Mac|queen has informed me you are going."</P>
<P>"It is perfectly convenient now to re&s;tore them Mad|am," replied Amanda, with a voice perfectly recovered, animated with con&s;cious innocence and offended pride, which al&s;o gave her &s;trength. "I &s;hall return," con|tinued &s;he moving to the door, "with them immedi|ately to your Lady&s;hip."</P>
<P>The picture was &s;u&s;pended from her neck, and the ring in its ca&s;e lay in her pocket; but, by the manner in which they had been a&s;ked, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ather demanded from her, &s;he felt, amid&s;t the angui&s;h of her &s;oul, a &s;udden emotion of plea&s;ure that &s;he could directly give them b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ck; yet when in her own room &s;he ha&s;tily untied the picture <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rom her neck, pulled the black ribbon from it, and laid it in its ca&s;e; her grief overcame every other feel|ing, and a &s;hower of tears fell from her.&mdash;"Oh, Morti|mer! dear Mortimer!

I behold Mortimer again, it will be as the hu&s;band of Lady Euphra&s;ia."</P>
<P>She recollected &s;he was &s;taying beyond the expected time, and wiped away her tears: yet &s;till &s;he lingered a few minutes in her chamber, to try and calm her agi|tation. She called her pride to her aid, it in&s;pired her with fortitude, and &s;he proceeded to Lady Martha, de|termined that Lady &s;hould &s;ee nothing in her manner, which &s;he could po&s;&s;ibly con&s;true into weakne&s;s or meanne&s;s.</P>
<P>Never did &s;he appear more intere&s;ting than at the moment &s;he re-entered the apartment. The pa&s;&s;ion &s;he had called to her aid gave a bright glow to her cheeks, and the traces of the tears &s;he had been &s;hed|ding appeared upon tho&s;e glowing cheeks like dew on the &s;ilken leaves of the ro&s;e ere the &s;un-beams of the morning has exhaled it. Tho&s;e tears left a humid lu&s;tre in her eyes, even more intere&s;ting than their wonted brilliancy&mdash;Her hair hung in rich and unre&s;trained lux|uriance, for &s;he had thrown off her hat on fir&s;t going to her chamber, and gave to the beauty of her face, and the elegance of her form, a complete fini&s;hing.</P>
<P>"Here, madam, is the ring," cried &s;he, pre&s;enting it to Lady Martha, "and here is the picture," &s;he would have added, but her voice faltered, and a tear &s;tarted from her eye; determined to conceal, if po&s;&s;ible, her feelings, &s;he ha&s;tily da&s;hed away the pearly fugitive. Lady Martha was again extending her hand, when Lord Mortimer &s;uddenly &s;tarted from a couch on which he had thrown him&s;elf, and &s;natched the picture from the trembling hand that held it, pulled it from its ca&s;e, and flinging it on the floor trampled it beneath his feet:&mdash;"Thus peri&s;h," exclaimed he, "every memento of my attachment to Amanda! Oh! wretched, wretched girl!" cried he, &s;uddenly gra&s;ping her hand, and as &s;uddenly relinqui&s;hing it, "Oh! wretched, wretched girl, you have undone your&s;elf and me!" He turned abruptly away, and in&s;tantly quitted the room. Shocked by his word<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, and terrified by his manner, Amanda had ju&s;t power to gain a chair. Lady Martha &s;eemed al&s;o thun|der&s;truck:
<PB N="32" REF="038416_0603_1011E6B69A786DA0">
but from the mu&s;ing attitude in which &s;he &s;tood, the deep convul&s;ive &s;uffocating &s;obs of Amanda &s;oon called her. She went to her, and finding her una|ble to help her&s;elf, loo&s;ened her cravat, bathed her tem|ples with lavender, and gave her water to drink. Tho&s;e attentions, and the tears &s;he &s;hed, revived Amanda. She rai&s;ed her&s;elf in her chair, on which &s;he had fallen back, but was yet too much agitated to &s;tand.</P>
<P>"Poor unhappy young creature!" &s;aid Lady Martha, "I pity you from my &s;oul. Ah! if your mind re&s;em|bled your per&s;on, what a perfect creature had you been! How happy had then been my poor Mortimer!"</P>
<P>Now, now was the te&s;t, the &s;hining te&s;t of Amanda's virtue, agonized by knowing &s;he had lo&s;t the good opi|nion of tho&s;e whom &s;he loved with &s;uch ardor, e&s;teemed with &s;uch reverence. She knew by a few words &s;he could explain the appearances which had deprived her of his good opinion, and fully regain it, regain, by a few words, the love, the e&s;teem of her valued, her ine&s;tima|ble Mortimer, the affection, the protection of his amia|ble aunt and &s;i&s;ter. She leaned her head upon her hand, the weight on her bo&s;om became le&s;s oppre&s;&s;ive, &s;he rail|ed her head: Of my innocence I can give &s;uch proofs," cried &s;he&mdash;Her lips clo&s;ed, a mortal palene&s;s over&s;pread her face, the &s;ound of &s;uicide &s;eemed piercing through her ear, &s;he trembled, the &s;olemn, the dreadful declara|tion Lord Cherbury had made of not &s;urviving the di&s;|clo&s;ure of his &s;ecret, her promi&s;e of inviolably keeping it, both ru&s;hed upon her mind, &s;he beheld her&s;elf on the very verge of a tremendous precipice, and about plunging her|&s;elf and a fellow creature into it, from whence, at the tri|bunal of her God, &s;he &s;hould have to an&s;wer for acce|lerating the death of that fellow creature: "And is it by a breach of faith!" &s;he a&s;ked her&s;elf; "I hoped to be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in the opinion of Lord Mortimer and his relations.&mdash;Ah! mi&s;taken idea, and how great is the delu&s;ion pa&s;&s;ion &s;preads before our eyes, even if their e&s;teem could be thus regained! Oh! what were that, or what the e&s;teem, the plaudits of the world, if tho&s;e of my own heart was gone forever? Oh! never," cried
<PB N="33" REF="038416_0604_1011E6B8347F8788">
&s;he, &s;till to her&s;elf, and rai&s;ing her eyes to heaven, "oh! never may the pang of &s;elf-reproach be added to tho&s;e which now oppre&s;s me!" her heart at the moment form|ed a &s;olemn vow never by any wilful act, to merit &s;uch a pang: "And, Oh! my God," &s;he cried, "forgive thy weak creature, who, a&s;&s;ailed by &s;trong temptation, thought for a moment of wandering from the path of truth and integrity, which can alone conduct her to the region where peace and immortal glory will be her's."</P>
<P>Amanda, amid&s;t her powerful emotions, forgot &s;he was ob&s;erved, except by that Being to whom &s;he appli|ed for pardon and future &s;trength. Lady Martha had been a &s;ilent &s;pectator of her emotions, and, thinking as &s;he did of Amanda, could only hope they proceeded from contrition for her pa&s;t conduct, forcibly awakened by reflecting on the deprivations it had cau&s;ed her.</P>
<P>When &s;he again &s;aw Amanda able to pay attention &s;he addre&s;&s;ed her: "I &s;aid I was &s;orry for witne&s;&s;ing your di&s;tre&s;s, I &s;hall not repeat the expre&s;&s;ion, thinking as I now do, I hope that it is occa&s;ioned by regret for pa&s;t er|rors; the tears of repentance wa&s;h away the &s;tains of guilt, and that heart mu&s;t indeed be callous which the &s;igh of remor&s;e will not melt to pity." Amanda turned her eyes with earne&s;tne&s;s on Lady Martha, as &s;he &s;poke, and her cheeks were again tinged with a faint glow.</P>
<P>"Perhaps, I &s;peak too plainly," cried Lady Martha witne&s;&s;ing this glow, and imputing it to re&s;entment; but I have ever liked the undi&s;gui&s;ed language of &s;ince|rity. It gave me plea&s;ure, &s;he continued, "to hear you had been in employment at Mrs. Duncan's, but that plea&s;ure was de&s;troyed by hearing you were going to London, though to &s;eek your brother, Mrs. Duncan has informed Mrs. Macqueen. If this were indeed the mo|tive, there are means of inquiring without taking &s;o im|prudent a &s;tep."</P>
<P>"Imprudent!" repeated Amanda, involuntarily.</P>
<P>"Yes," cried Lady Martha, "a journey &s;o long without a protector to a young, I mu&s;t add, a lovely woman, teems with danger, from which a mind of de|licacy
<PB N="34" REF="038416_0605_1011E6BCC3922F40">

If indeed you go to &s;eek your brother, and he regards you a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> he &s;hould, he would rather have you neglect him (though that you need not have done by &s;taying with Mrs. Duncan) than run into the way of in&s;ults. No emergency in life &s;hould lead us to do an improper thing, as trying to produce good by evil is impious, &s;o trying to produce plea&s;ure by im|prudence is folly; they are trials, however flatteringly they may commence, which are &s;ure to end in &s;orrow and di&s;appointment."</P>
<P>"You will," continued Lady Martha, "if indeed anxious to e&s;cape from any further cen&s;ure than what has already befallen you, return to Mrs. Duncan. When I inform you (if indeed you are already ignorant of it) that Col. Belgrave pa&s;&s;ed this road about a month ago, in his way from a remote part of Scotland to London, where he now is."</P>
<P>"I cannot help," &s;aid Amanda, "the mi&s;con&s;truc|tions which may be put on my actions; I can only &s;up|port my&s;elf under the pain they inflict by con&s;cious rec|titude.</P>
<P>"I am &s;hocked indeed at the &s;urmi&s;es entertained about me, and a wretch whom my &s;oul abhorred from the moment it knew its real principles."</P>
<P>"If," &s;aid Lady Martha, "your journey is really not prompted by the intention of &s;eeing your brother, you heighten every other error by duplicity."</P>
<P>"You are &s;evere, madam," exclaimed Amanda in who&s;e &s;oul the pride of injured innocence was again re|viving.</P>
<P>"If I probe the wound," cried Lady Martha, "I would al&s;o wi&s;h to heal it, it is the wi&s;h I feel of &s;av|ing a young creature from further error, of &s;erving a being once &s;o valued by him who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es my fir&s;t re|gard, that makes me &s;peak as I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ow do.

Return, I repeat, to Mrs. Duncan's, and if you want any inquiries made about your brother, dictate them, and I will take care they &s;hall be made, and that you &s;hall know their re|&s;ult." Had Amanda's motive for a journey to London been only to &s;eek her brother, &s;he would gladly have accepted of this offer&punc; th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s avoid the imputation of tra|velling after Belgrave, or of going to join him, the ha|zard of encountering <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">im in London, and the dangers of &s;o long a journey; but the affair of the will required expedition, and her own immediate pre&s;ence&mdash;an affair the injunction of Lady Dunreath had prohibited her di&s;|clo&s;ing to any one who could not immediately forward it, and which, if &s;uch an injunction never exi&s;ted, &s;he could not with propriety have divulged to Lady Mar|tha, who was &s;o &s;oon to be connected with a family &s;o materially concerned in it, and in who&s;e favour, on ac|count of her nephew's connexion with them, it was pro|bable &s;he might be bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Amanda hoped and believed, that in a place &s;o large as London, with her a&s;&s;umed name (which &s;he now re&s;ol|ved not to drop till in a more &s;ecure &s;ituation) &s;he &s;hould e&s;cape Belgrave. As to meeting him on the road &s;he had not the &s;malle&s;t apprehen&s;ions concerning that, na|turally concluding that he never would have taken &s;o long a journey as he had lately done, if he could have &s;taid but a few weeks away; time &s;he tru&s;ted would prove the fal&s;ity of the inferrence, which &s;he already was informed would be drawn from her per&s;everance in her journey. She told Lady Martha that &s;he thanked her for her kind offer, but mu&s;t decline it, as the line of con|duct &s;he had marked out for her&s;elf rendered it unnece&s;|&s;ary, who&s;e innocence would yet be ju&s;tified, &s;he ad|ded.

&s;he; "but, notwith&s;tanding it is &s;o contrary to my ideas of what is right, I cannot let you depart without telling you, that, &s;hould you at any time want or re|quire &s;ervices, which you would, or could not a&s;k from &s;trangers, or perhaps expect them to perform, acquaint me, and command mine; yet, in doing ju&s;tice to my own feeling, I mu&s;t not do inju&s;tice to the noble ones of Lord Mortimer; it is by his de&s;ire, as well as my own inclination, I now &s;peak to you in this manner, though pa&s;t events and the &s;ituation he is about entering into, mu&s;t forever preclude his per&s;onal interference in your affairs. He could never hear the daughter of Captain Fitzalan &s;uffered inconvenience of any kind, without wi&s;hing, without having her indeed, if po&s;&s;ible, extricated from it."</P>
<P>"Oh! Madam," cried Amanda, unable to repre&s;s her gu&s;hing tears, "I am already well acquainted with the noble feelings of Lord Mortimer, already oppre&s;&s;ed with a weight of obligations." Lady Martha was af|fected by her energy, her eyes grew humid, and her voice &s;oftened. "Error in you will be more inexcu&s;a|ble than others," cried Lady Martha, "becau&s;e, like too many unhappy creatures, you cannot plead the de|&s;ertion of all the world; to regret pa&s;t errors, be they what they may, is to in&s;ure my a&s;&s;i&s;tance and protec|tion, if both or either are at any time required by you; was I even gone, I &s;hould take care to leave a &s;ub&s;titute behind me, who &s;hould fulfil my intentions towards you, and by doing &s;o, at once &s;oothe and gratify the feelings of Lord Mortimer."</P>
<P>"I thank you, Madam," cried Amanda, ri&s;ing from her chair, and as &s;he wiped away her tears, &s;ummoning all her fortitude to her aid, "for the intere&s;t you expre&s;s about me; the time may yet come, perhaps, when I &s;hall prove I never was unworthy of exciting it, when the notice now offered from compa&s;&s;ion may be ten|dered from e&s;teem&mdash;then," continued Amanda, who could not forbear this ju&s;tice to her&s;elf, "the pity La|dy Martha Dormer will not humble but exalt me, be|cau&s;e then I &s;hall know that it proceeds from that gene|rous

&s;ympathy, which one virtuous mind feels for ano|ther in di&s;tre&s;s." She moved to the door. "How la|mentable &s;aid Lady Martha, "to have &s;uch talents mi&s;|applied!"</P>
<P>"Ah! Madam," cried Amanda, &s;topping, and turn|ing mournfully to her, "I find you are inflexible."</P>
<P>Lady Martha &s;hook her head, and Amanda had laid her hand upon the lock, when Lady Martha &s;aid &s;ud|denly, "there were letters pa&s;&s;ed between you and Lord Mortimer." Amanda bowed.</P>
<P>"They had better be mutually returned," &s;aid La|dy Martha. "Do you &s;eal up his, and &s;end them to Lord Cherbury's hou&s;e in London directed to me, and I pledge my&s;elf to have your's returned."</P>
<P>"You &s;hall be obeyed, Madam," replied Amanda, in a low broken voice, after the pau&s;e of a moment. Lady Martha then &s;aid &s;he would no longer encroach upon her re&s;t, and &s;he retired.</P>
<P>In her chamber the feelings &s;he had &s;o long, &s;o pain|fully tried to &s;uppre&s;s, broke forth without again meet|ing oppo&s;ition; the pride which had given her tran&s;ient animation, was no more, for as pa&s;t circum&s;tances aro&s;e to recollection, &s;he could not wonder at her being condemn|ed from them. She no longer accu&s;ed Lady Martha in her mind of &s;everity, no longer felt offended with her; but, oh! Mortimer, the bitter tears &s;he &s;hed fell not for her&s;elf alone, &s;he wept to think thy de&s;tiny, though more pro&s;|perous, was not le&s;s unhappy than her own, for in thy broken accents, thy altered looks, &s;he perceived a pa&s;|&s;ion &s;trong and &s;incere as ever for her, and well &s;he knew Lady Euphra&s;ia not calculated to &s;oothe a &s;ad heart, or &s;teal an image from it which corroded its felicity. Re&s;t after the incidents of the evening was not to be thought of, but nature was exhau&s;ted, and in&s;en&s;ibly Amanda &s;unk upon the bed in a deep &s;leep, &s;o in&s;en&s;ibly, that when &s;he awoke, which was not till the morning was pretty far advanced, &s;he felt &s;urpri&s;ed at her &s;ituation; &s;he felt cold and unrefre&s;hed from having lain in her clothes all night, and when &s;he went to adju&s;t her dre&s;s

Anxious to e&s;cape a &s;econd painful meeting, &s;he went to the window to &s;ee if the chai&s;e was come, but was di&s;appainted on finding that &s;he had &s;lept at the back of the hou&s;e; &s;he heard no noi&s;e, and concluding the family had not yet ri&s;en after the amu&s;ements of the pre|ceding night, &s;at down, by the window which looked in|to a &s;pacious garden, above which ro&s;e romantic hills that formed a &s;creen for &s;ome young and beautiful plan|tations that lay between them and the garden; but the mi&s;ty tops of the hills, the varied trees which autumn &s;pread over the plantations, nor the neat appearance of the garden, had power to amu&s;e the imagination of A|manda! Her patience was exhau&s;ted after &s;itting &s;ome time, and going to the door &s;he &s;oftly opened it, to try if &s;he could hear any one &s;tirring. She had not &s;tood long, when the &s;ound of foot&s;teps and voices ro&s;e from below. She in&s;tantly quitted her room, and de&s;cended the &s;tairs into a &s;mall hall, acro&s;s which was a folding door; this &s;he gently opened, and found it divided the hall &s;he &s;tood in from one that was &s;pacious and lofty, and which her pa&s;&s;ing through the preceding night be|fore it was lighted up, had prevented her taking notice of; here, at a long table, were the men &s;ervants belong|ing to the family and the gue&s;ts a&s;&s;embled at a break|fa&s;t, the piper at the head, lik the king of the fea&s;t. Amanda &s;tepped back the moment &s;he perceived them, well knowing Lord Mortimer's &s;ervants would recollect her, and was a&s;cending the &s;tairs to her room to ring for one of the maids, when a &s;ervant ha&s;tily followed her, and &s;aid the family were already in the breakfa&s;t room; at the &s;ame moment Mr. Colin Macqueen came from a parlour which opened in the little hall, and pay|ing Amanda, in a lively and affectionate manner the compliments of the morning, he led her to the parlour, where not only all the family gue&s;ts who had laid in the hou&s;e, but &s;everal gentlemen, who had been with them the preceding night, were a&s;&s;embled.&mdash;Doctor John&s;on has already celebrated a Scotch breakfa&s;t, nor was the one at which Mrs. Macqueen and her fair daughters

<P>"I was ju&s;t going to &s;end one of the girls for you," &s;aid Mrs. Macqueen, when Amanda had taken a place at the table, "and would have done &s;o before, but wi&s;h|ed you to get as much re&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, after your fa|tiguing journey."</P>
<P>"I a&s;&s;ure you, madam," &s;aid Amanda, "I have been up this long time, expecting every moment a &s;ummons to the chai&s;e."</P>
<P>"I took care of that la&s;t night," &s;aid Mrs. Mac|queen, "for I was determined you &s;hould not depart at lea&s;t without breakfa&s;ting."

<P>"I am &s;ure," cried Lord Martimer, attempting to &s;peak cheerfully, "your acceptance of it would do ho|nour to the pre&s;enter.</P>
<P>"And your Lord&s;hip may be &s;ure too," &s;aid one of her brothers, "it is a favour &s;he would wi&s;h with all her heart to have an opportunity of returning."</P>

<P>"Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> do you think, Mi&s;s Donald," cried Colin Macqueen, turning to Amanda, "do you imagine &s;he would not?" Amanda could &s;carcely &s;peak; &s;he tried however to hide her agitation, and forcing a faint &s;mile, with a voice nearly as faint, &s;aid, "that was not a fair que&s;tion."

when Mrs. Macqueen ri&s;ing drew her to the window, and in a low voice repeated her reque&s;t for Amanda's company a few days. This Amanda again declined, but gratefully expre&s;&s;ed her thanks for it, and the ho&s;pitality &s;he had experienced.

<P>"You &s;hould a&s;k your brother," he replied; he has locked them up in the plantation; a frolic was at all times plea&s;ing to the light hearted Macqueens, and to enjoy the pre&s;ent one, off they ran directly, followed by their brothers, all calling as they ran to Amanda not to &s;tir till they came back, which would be in a few minutes; but Amanda, from the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">kward, the agita|ting

"Amanda," in the next moment, &s;aid a voice to which her heart vibra|ted. She turned with involuntary quickne&s;s, and &s;aw Lord Mortimer clo&s;e by her.

Aman|da," &s;aid he again looking at her, "the &s;cene which happened la&s;t night was di&s;tre&s;&s;ing.

<P>Amanda unutterably affected, covered her face to hide the tears which bedewed it.</P>
<P>"Let me have the plea&s;ure of hearing," continued Lord Mortimer, "that you forgive the unea&s;ine&s;s and pain I might have occa&s;ioned you la&s;t night."</P>
<P>"Forgive!" repeated Amanda, "Oh! my Lord," and her voice &s;unk in the &s;obs which heaved her bo&s;om. "Could I think you were, you would be happy." Lord Mortimer &s;topt, overcome by &s;trong emotions.</P>

<P>SHE alighted from the carriage when it &s;topped at the door, and entered the &s;hop, where, to her inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction, the fir&s;t object &s;he be|held was Mi&s;s Ru&s;hbrook &s;itting pen&s;ively at one of the counters. The moment &s;he &s;aw Amanda &s;he recol|lected her, and &s;tarting up exclaimed, as &s;he took her hand, "Ah! dear madam, this it indeed a joyful &s;ur|pri&s;e! Ah! how often have I wi&s;hed to meet you again to expre&s;s my gratitude." The affectionate reception &s;he met, and the unexpected &s;ight of Mi&s;s Ru&s;hbrook, &s;eem|ed to promi&s;e Amanda, that her wi&s;hes relative to Ru&s;h|brook would not only be a accelerated, but crowned with &s;ucce&s;s. She returned the fervent pre&s;&s;ure of Mi&s;s Ru&s;h|brook's hand and enquired after her parents; the enquiry appeared di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, and &s;he was an&s;wered with he&s;itati|on that they were indifferent; the evident embarra&s;&s;|ment her que&s;tion excited prevented her renewing it at this time. The mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e was not pre&s;ent, and Amanda reque&s;ted, if &s;he was within, &s;he might &s;ee her directly. Mi&s;s Ru&s;hbrook immediately &s;tepped to a parlour behind the &s;hop; and almo&s;t in&s;tantly returned followed by the Lady her&s;elf, who was a little fat Iri&s;h woman, pa&s;t her prime, but not pa&s;t her reli&s;h for the good things of this life: "Dear Madam," &s;aid &s;he, court&s;eying to Amanda, "you are very welcome; I prote&s;t I am very glad to &s;ee you, though I never had that plea&s;ure but once before; but it is no wonder I &s;hould be &s;o, for I have heard your prai&s;es every day &s;ince, I am &s;ure, from that young Lady, looking at Mi&s;s Ru&s;hbrook.

too full of the purpo&s;e of this vi&s;ite to allow her to &s;peak about any thing el&s;e.

<P>"Dear Ma'am," &s;aid Mrs. Connel, "I prote&s;t I &s;hould have been happy to have accommodated you, but at pre&s;ent my hou&s;e is quite full."</P>
<P>The di&s;appointment this &s;peech gave Amanda render|ed her &s;ilent for a moment and &s;he was then going to a&s;k Mrs. Connel if &s;he could recommend her to a lodg|ging, when &s;he perceived Mi&s;s Ru&s;hbrook whi&s;pering her. "Why, Madam," cried the former, who by a nod of her head &s;eemed to approve of what the latter had been &s;aying, "&s;ince you di&s;like &s;o much going among&s;t &s;trangers, which indeed &s;hews your prudence, con&s;ider|ing what que<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r kind of people are in the world, Mi&s;s Emily &s;ays, that if you conde&s;cend to accept of part of her little bed, till you can &s;ettle your&s;elf a little more comfortably in town, you &s;hall be extremely welcome to it; and I can a&s;&s;ure you, Madam, I &s;hall do every thing in my power to render my hou&s;e agreeable to you."</P>

Mrs. Connel &s;tirred a declin|ing fire into a cheerful blaze, and de&s;ired to know if Amanda would chu&s;e any thing for dinner. "Speak the word only, my dear," &s;aid &s;he, "and I think I can procure you a cold bone in the hou&s;e.

<P>"Well, well," cried Mrs. Connel, "you &s;hall have a &s;nug cup of tea by and by, and a hot muffin with it.

<P>Emily retired &s;oon after Amanda entered; but return|ed in a few minutes with her hat and cloak on, and &s;aid, "nothing but a vi&s;it &s;he mu&s;t pay her parents &s;hould have induced her to forego, for the fir&s;t evening at lea&s;t, the plea&s;ure of Mi&s;s Donald's &s;ociety."</P>
<P>Amanda thanked her for her politene&s;s, but a&s;&s;ured <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">er, if con&s;idered as a re&s;traint &s;he would be unhappy.</P>

"To Lady Grey&s;tock! why, Lord, one might as well apply to one of the wild bea&s;ts in the Tower. Ah! poor Gentleman, if he was never to get nothing but what &s;he gave him, I believe he would not long be a trouble to any one. It is now about fourteen years &s;ince my acquaintance with him fir&s;t commenced. My poor hu&s;band, that is no more, and I kept a &s;hop in Dublin, where the Captain's regiment was quartered, and he be|ing only a Lieutenant had not room enough for his fami|ly in the barracks, &s;o he took lodgings at our hou&s;e, where Mrs. Ru&s;hbrook lay in, and I being with her now and then during her confinement, a kind of friend&s;hip grew among&s;t us. They had not left us long to go to America, when a relation of my hu&s;band's, who owned this hou&s;e and &s;hop, having lo&s;t his wife, and being lone&s;ome, without either chick or child, invited us to come and live with him, promi&s;ing us if we did to &s;ettle us in his bu&s;ine&s;s, and leave us every thing he had.&mdash;Well, &s;uch offers do not come every day, &s;o to be &s;ure we took him at his word, and here we had not been long when the poor man bid adieu to all mortal care, and was &s;oon followed by Mr. Connel. Well, to be &s;ure, I was &s;ad and &s;olitary enough; but when I thought how irre|ligious it was to break one's heart with grief, I plucked up my &s;pirits, and began to hold up my head again; &s;o to make a &s;hort &s;tory of a long one, about &s;ix years ago Mrs. Ru&s;hbrook and Mi&s;s Emily came one day into the &s;hop to buy &s;omething, little thinking they &s;hould &s;ee an old friend, it was to be &s;ure a meeting of joy and &s;orrow as one may &s;ay, we told all our griefs to each other, and I found things were very bad with the poor Captain; in|deed I have a great regard for him and his family, and when he was confined I took Emily home as an a&s;&s;i&s;tant in my bu&s;ine&s;s; the money &s;he earned was to go to her parents, and I agreed to give her her clothes gratis; but that would have gone but a little way in feeding &s;o many mouths, had I not procured plain work for Mrs. Ru&s;h|brook and her daughters.

&s;o &s;aying, &s;he &s;tarted up, and ringing the bell, took the tea-things from a beaufet where they were kept; the maid, having obeyed the well known &s;ummons, then retired, and as &s;oon as the tea was made, and the muffins buttered, Mrs. Connel made Amanda draw her chair clo&s;e to the table that &s;he might, as &s;he &s;aid, look &s;nug, and drink her tea comfortably.</P>
<P>"I a&s;&s;ure you, ma'am," cried &s;he, "it was a lucky hour for Mi&s;s Emily when &s;he entered my hou&s;e."</P>

<P>"You mu&s;t know, madam," proceeded Mrs. Connel, "about a month ago a gentleman came to lodge with me, who I &s;oon found was making &s;peeches to Mi&s;s E|mily; he was one of tho&s;e wild looking &s;parks who, like Ranger in the play, look as if they would be pop|ping through every one's doors and windows, and play|ing &s;uch tricks, as made poor Mr. Strickland &s;o jealous of his wife.

the young man's inability to &s;erve them. To be &s;ure he promi&s;ed fair enough; but, Lord! what could a poor curate do for them, particularly when he got a wife and hou&s;e full of children of his own I thought? &s;o I &s;uppo&s;ed they would be quite glad to be off with him, and to give her to Mr. Sipthorpe; but no &s;uch thing I a&s;&s;ure you. When I mentioned it to them, one talked of honour, and another of gratitude, and as to Mi&s;s Emily &s;he fairly went into fits. Well, I thought I would &s;erve them in &s;pite of them&s;elves, &s;o knowing the curate to be a ro|mantic young fellow, I writes off to him, and tells him what a cruel thing it would be, if, for his own gratifica|tion, he kept Mi&s;s Emily to her word, and made her lo&s;e a match, which would free her family from all their diffi|culties, and in &s;hort I touched up his pa&s;&s;ion not a little I a&s;&s;ure you, and, as I hoped, a letter came from him, in which he told her he gave her up.

Mrs. Connel's volubility tormented them both; &s;upper happily terminated it, as &s;he was then much better em|ployed, in her own opinion, than &s;he could po&s;&s;ibly have been in talking&mdash;Amanda pleaded fatigue for retiring early. Mrs. Connel advi&s;ed her to try a few gla&s;&s;es of wine as a re&s;torative; but &s;he begged to be excu&s;ed, and was allowed to retire with Emily. The chamber was &s;mall, but neat, and enlivened by a good fire, to which Amanda and Emily &s;at down while undre&s;&s;ing. The latter eagerly availed her&s;elf of this opportunity to expre&s;s the gratitude of her heart. Amanda tried to change the di&s;cour&s;e, but could not &s;ucceed. "Long, madam," continued Emily, "have we wi&s;hed to return our thanks for a benefaction &s;o delicately conveyed as your's, and happy were my parents to night when I informed them I could now expre&s;s their grateful feel|ings."</P>
<P>"Though intere&s;ted exceedingly in your affairs," &s;aid Amanda, making another effort to change the di&s;|cour&s;e, "be a&s;&s;ured I never &s;hould have taken the liber|ty of inquiring minutely into them, and I mention this left you might &s;uppo&s;e, from what Mrs. Connel &s;aid, that I had done &s;o."</P>

<Q><L>Take heed, take heed, thou lovely maid,</L>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TO open our hearts to tho&s;e we know will commi&s;erate our &s;orrows is the &s;weete&s;t con&s;olation tho&s;e &s;orrows can receive; to you, then, madam, I divulge mine, &s;ure at lea&s;t of pity. At the time I fir&s;t had the happine&s;s of &s;eeing you, the little credit my father had was exhau&s;ted, and his inability to pay being well known, he was arre&s;ted one evening as he &s;at by the bed-&s;ide of my almo&s;t expiring mother! I will not pain your gentle nature by dwelling on the horrors of that moment, on the agonies of a parent, and a hu&s;band torn from a family &s;o &s;i|tuated as was my father's; feeble, emaciated, without e|ven &s;ufficient clothing to guard him from the inclemency of the weather, he leaned upon the arm of one of the bai|liffs, as he turned his eyes from that wife he never more expected to behold. She fainted at the moment he left the room, and it was many minutes ere I had power to approach her. The long continuance of her fit at length recalled my di&s;tracted thoughts; but I had no re&s;tora|tives to apply, no a&s;&s;i&s;tance to recover her, for my elde&s;t brother had followed my father, and the re&s;t of the children, terrified by the &s;cene they had witne&s;&s;ed, wept together in a corner of the room. I had at la&s;t recol|lected a Lady, who lived nearly oppo&s;ite to us, and from whom I hoped to procure &s;ome relief for her; nothing but the pre&s;ent emergency could have made me apply to

her, for the attention &s;he had paid us on fir&s;t coming to Mr. Heathfield's was entirely withdrawn after his death. Pride, however, was forgotten at the pre&s;ent moment, and I flew to the hou&s;e.&mdash;The &s;ervant &s;hewed me into a parlour, where &s;he, her daughters, and a young clergy|man I had never before &s;een, were &s;itting at tea. I could not bring my&s;elf to mention my di&s;tre&s;s before a &s;tranger, and accordingly begged to &s;peak to her in ano|ther room; but &s;he told me, in a blunt manner, I might &s;peak there. In a low and fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ltering voice, which &s;ighs and tears often impeded, I acquainted her of what had happened, the &s;ituation of my mother, and reque&s;ted a cordial for her. How great was my confu&s;ion when &s;he declared aloud all I had told her, and turning to her daughter, bid her give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of a bottle of wine. "Aye, aye," cried &s;he, "I always thought things would turn out &s;o; it was really very fooli&s;h of Mr. Heathfield to bring you to his hou&s;e, and lead you all into &s;uch expences! I li&s;tened to no more, but, taking the wine with a &s;ilent pang, retired.</P>
<P>"I had not been many minutes returned, and was kneeling by the bed&s;ide of my mother who began to &s;hew &s;ome &s;ymptoms of returning life, when a gentle knock came to the hall door: I &s;uppo&s;ed it my brother, and bid one of the children fly to open it. What was my &s;urpri&s;e when in a few minutes &s;he returned, follow|ed by the young clergyman I had ju&s;t &s;een! I &s;tarted from my kneeling po&s;ture, and my looks expre&s;&s;ed my wonder. He approached, and, in the &s;oft accent of be|nevolence, appoligized for his intru&s;ion; but &s;aid, he came with a hope and a wi&s;h that he might be &s;ervice|able. Oh! how &s;oothing were his words! Oh! how painfully plea&s;ing the voice of tenderne&s;s to the wretch|ed! The tears, which pride and indignation had &s;u&s;pend|ed but a few moments before, again began flowing.</P>
<P>"But I will not dwell upon my feelings; &s;uffice it to &s;ay, that every attention which could mitigate my wretchedne&s;s he paid, and that his efforts, aided by mine, &s;oon re&s;tored my mother. His looks, his mannre, his profe&s;&s;ion, all con&s;pired to calm her &s;pirits, and &s;he

ble&s;&s;ed the power which &s;o unexpectedly gave us a friend. My brother returned from my father merely to enquire how we were, and to go back to him directly. The &s;tranger reque&s;ted permi&s;&s;ion to accompany him, a re|que&s;t mo&s;t plea&s;ing to us, as we tru&s;ted his &s;oothing attention would have the &s;ame effect upon his &s;orrowing heart as it had upon our's. Scarcely had he gone ere a man arrived from a neighbouring hotel with a ba&s;ket loaded with wine and provi&s;ions; but to enumerate eve|ry in&s;tance of this young man's goodne&s;s would be en|croaching upon your patience; in &s;hort, by his care my mother in a few days was able to be carried to my fa|ther's pri&s;on. Mrs. Connel, who on the fir&s;t intimation of our di&s;tre&s;s, had come to us, took me into her hou&s;e at a &s;tated &s;alary, which was to be given to my parents, and the re&s;t of the children were to continue with them. My mother de&s;ired me one evening to take a walk with the children to Ken&s;ington, as &s;he thought them injur|ed by con&s;tant confinement. Our friend attended us, and in our way thither informed me that he mu&s;t &s;oon leave town, as he was but a country curate, and his leave of ab&s;ence from his rector was expired: it was above a month &s;ince we had known him, during which time his attentions were unremitted, and he was a &s;ource of com|fort to us all. A &s;udden chill came over my heart as he &s;poke, and every &s;orrow at that moment &s;eemed aggra|vated. On entering Ken&s;ington gardens, I &s;eated my|&s;elf on a little ri&s;ing mount, for I felt trembling and fa|tigued, and he &s;at be&s;ide me. Never had I before felt &s;o oppre&s;&s;ed, and my tears gu&s;hed forth in &s;pite of my efforts to re&s;train them. Something I &s;aid of their be|ing occa&s;ioned by the recollection of the period when my parents enjoyed the charming &s;cene I now con|templated along with me. "Would to heaven," cried he, "I could re&s;tore them to the enjoyment of it."</P>
<P>"Ah!" &s;aid I, "they already lie under unreturn|able obligations to you; in lo&s;ing you," added I, in|voluntarily, "they will lo&s;e their only comfort."</P>
<P>"Since then," "cried he, "you flatter me, by &s;aying it is in my power to give them comfort, oh! let them

have a con&s;tant claim upon me for it. Oh! Emily," he continued, taking my hand, "let them be my pa|rents as well as your's; then will their too &s;crupulous delicacy be conquered, and they will receive as a right what they now con&s;ider as a favour." I felt my cheeks glow with blu&s;hes, but &s;till did not perfectly conceive his meaning. "My de&s;tiny is humble," he continued; "was it otherwi&s;e, I &s;hould long &s;ince have entreated you to &s;hare it with me; could you be prevailed on to do &s;o, you would give it plea&s;ures it never yet experien|ced." He pau&s;ed for a reply, but I was unable to give one.</P>
<P>Ah! Madam, how little nece&s;&s;ity either was there for one, my looks, my confu&s;ion, betrayed my feelings. He urged me to &s;peak, and at la&s;t I acknowledged I &s;hould not he&s;itate to &s;hare his de&s;tiny, but for my pa|rents, who by &s;uch a mea&s;ure would lo&s;e my a&s;&s;i&s;tance. "Oh do not think," cried he, "I would ever wi&s;h to tempt you into any &s;ituation which &s;hould make you ne|glect them. He then proceeded to &s;ay, "that though unable at pre&s;ent to liberate them, yet he tru&s;ted that, if they con&s;ented to our union, he &s;hould, by economy, be enabled to contribute more e&s;&s;entially to their &s;upport than I could do, and al&s;o be able in a &s;hort time to di&s;|charge their debts." His propo&s;als were made known to them, and met their warme&s;t approbation. The plea&s;ure they derived from them was more on my ac|count than their own, as the idea of having me &s;o &s;et|tled removed a weight of anxiety from their minds; &s;ome of my brothers and &s;i&s;ters &s;hould live with us, he &s;aid, and promi&s;ed my time &s;hould be chiefly &s;pent in doing fine works, which &s;hould be &s;ent to Mrs. Connel to di&s;po&s;e of for my parents, and al&s;o that, from time to time, I &s;hould vi&s;it them till I had the power of bring|ing them to my cottage, for &s;uch he de&s;cribed his re&s;i|dence.</P>
<P>"He was compelled to go to the country, but it was &s;ettled he &s;hould return in a &s;hort time, and have every thing finally &s;ettled. In about a week after his depar|ture, as I was returning one morning from a Lady's,
<PB N="56" REF="038416_0627_1011E6F61075CE60">
where I had been on a me&s;&s;age from Mrs. Connel, a gentleman joined me in the &s;treet, and, with a rude fa|miliarity, endeavoured to enter into conver&s;ation with me. I endeavoured to &s;hake him off, but could not &s;uc|ceed, and ha&s;tened home with the utmo&s;t expedition, whither I &s;aw he followed me. I thought no more of the incident till about-two days after I &s;aw him enter the &s;hop, and heard him enquire of Mrs. Connel about her lodgings, which to my great mortification he immediately took, for I could not help &s;u&s;pecting he had &s;ome impro|per motive for taking them: I re&s;olved, however, if &s;uch a motive really exi&s;ted, to di&s;appoint it by keeping out of his way; but all my vigilance was unavailing, he was continually on the watch for me, and I could not go up or down &s;tairs without being in&s;ulted by him. I at length informed Mrs. Connel of his conduct, and en|treated her to fulfil the &s;acred tru&s;t her friends repo&s;ed in her, when they gave me to her care, by terminating the i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ults of Mr. Sipthorpe. Alas! could I have po&s;&s;i|bly fore&s;een the con&s;equences that would have followed my application to her, I &s;hould have borne tho&s;e in&s;ults in &s;ilence. She has already informed you of them. Oh! Madam, when the letter came, which di&s;&s;olved a pro|mi&s;e &s;o cheerfully, &s;o fondly given, every pro&s;pect of fe|licity was in a moment over&s;hadowed? For a long time I re&s;i&s;ted every effort that was made to prevail on me to marry Sipthorpe; but when at la&s;t my mother &s;aid &s;he was &s;orry to find my feelings le&s;s than his, who had &s;o generou&s;lly re&s;igned me that my father might be extri|cated from his difficulties, I &s;hrunk with agony at the rebuke. I wondered, I was &s;hocked, how I could have &s;o long he&s;itated to open the pri&s;on gates of my father, and determined from that moment to &s;acrifice my&s;elf for him; for oh! Mi&s;s Donald, it is a &s;acrifice of the mo&s;t dreadful nature I am about making. Sipthorpe is a man I never could have liked, had my heart even been di&s;engaged."</P>
<P>Amanda felt the true&s;t pity for her young friend, who ended her narrative in tears: but &s;he did not, by yielding entirely to that pity (as too many girls, with
<PB N="57" REF="038416_0628_1011E6F7B9DC58F0">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ender hearts, but weak heads, might have done) height|en the &s;orrow of Mi&s;s Ru&s;hbrook.&mdash;She proved her friend&s;hip and &s;ympathy more &s;incerely than &s;he could have done by mere expre&s;&s;ions of condolement, which feed the grief they commi&s;erate, in trying to reconcile her to a de&s;tiny that &s;eemed irrevocable; &s;he pointed out the claims a parent had upon a child, and dwelt up|one the delight a child experienced when con&s;cious of fulfilling tho&s;e claims. She &s;poke of the rapture attend|ing the triumph of rea&s;on and humanity over &s;elf and pa&s;&s;ion, and mentioned the &s;ilent plaudits of the heart as &s;uperior to all gratification, or external advintages. She &s;poke from the real feelings of her &s;oul; &s;he recol|lected the period at which, to a father's admonition, &s;he had re&s;igned a lover, and had that father been in captain Ru&s;hbrook's &s;ituation, and the &s;ame &s;acrifice been de|manded from her as from Emily, &s;he felt, without he&s;i|tation, &s;he would have made it. She was indeed a mon|itre&s;s that had practi&s;e, and would practice (was there a nece&s;&s;ity for &s;o doing) the le&s;&s;ons &s;he gave, not as poor Ophelia &s;ays,
<Q><L>Like &s;ome ungracious pa&s;tors,</L>
<L>Who &s;hew the &s;teep and thorny path to heav'n,</L>
<L>But take the primro&s;e won them&s;elves.</L></Q>
The &s;weet con&s;ciousne&s;s of this gave energy, and more than u&s;ual eloquence to her language; but, whil&s;t &s;he wi&s;hed to in&s;pire her young friend, &s;he felt from the tenderne&s;s of her nature, and the &s;ad &s;ituation of her own heart, what the friend mu&s;t feel from di&s;ap|pointed affection and a reluctant union. Scarcely could &s;he refrain from weeping over a fate &s;o wretched, and which &s;he was tempted to think as dreadful as her own; but a little reflection &s;oon convinced her &s;he had the &s;ad pre-eminence of mi&s;ery, for in her fate there was none of tho&s;e alleviations as in Emily's, which &s;he was con|vinced mu&s;t, in &s;ome degree, reconcile her to it; her &s;ufferings, unlike Emily's, would not be rewarded by knowing that they contributed to the comfort of tho&s;e deare&s;t to her heart."</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="038416_0629_1011E6FC9506D7D0">
"Your words my dear Madam," &s;aid Emily, "have calmed my &s;pirits, henceforth I will be more re&s;olute in trying to bani&s;h regrets from my mind; but I have been incon&s;iderate to a degree in keeping you &s;o long from re&s;t after your fatiguing journey." Amanda indeed ap|peared at this moment nearly exhau&s;ted, and gladly ha&s;tened to bed. Her &s;lumbers were &s;hort and unre|fre&s;hing; the cares which clung to her heart when wak|ing were equally oppre&s;&s;ive whil&s;t &s;leeping. Lord Mor|timer mingled in the meditations of the morning, in the vi&s;ions of the night, and when &s;he awoke &s;he found her pillow wet with the tears &s;he had &s;hed on his ac|count. Emily was already up, but on Amanda's draw|ing back the curtain &s;he laid down the book &s;he was reading, and came to her. She &s;aw &s;he looked extreme|ly ill, and imputing this to fatigue, reque&s;ted &s;he would breakfa&s;t in bed; but Amanda, who knew her illne&s;s proceeded from a cau&s;e which neither re&s;t nor a&s;&s;iduous care could cure, refu&s;ed complying with this reque&s;t, and immediately dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf. As &s;he &s;tood at the toilet, Emily &s;uddenly exclaimed, "If you have a mind to &s;ee Sipthorpe I will &s;hew him to you now, for he is ju&s;t going out." Amanda went to the window, which Emily gently opened; but, oh! what was the &s;hock of that moment, when in Sipthorpe &s;he recognized the in|&s;iduous Belgrave! A &s;hivering horror ran through her veins, and recoiling a few paces, &s;he &s;unk half fainting on a chair. Emily, terrified by her appearance, was flying to the bell to ring for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, when, by a faint motion of her hand, Amanda prevented her. "I &s;hall &s;oon be better," &s;aid &s;he, &s;peaking with difficulty; "but I will lie down on the bed for a few minutes, and I beg you may go to your breakfa&s;t." Emily refu&s;ed to go, and entreated that, in&s;tead of leaving her, &s;he might have breakfa&s;t brought up for them both. Amanda a&s;|&s;ured her &s;he could take nothing at pre&s;ent, and wi&s;hed for quiet: Emily therefore reluctantly left her. Aman|da now endeavoured to compo&s;e her di&s;tracted thoughts, and quiet the throbbings of her agonized heart, that &s;he might be able to arrange &s;ome plan for extricating her|&s;elf
<PB N="59" REF="038416_0630_1011E6FF17F85A40">
from her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, which appeared replete with every danger to her imagination; for from the li|bertine principles of Belgrave, &s;he could not hope that a new object of pur&s;uit would detach him from her, when he found her &s;o unexpectedly thrown in his way; unprotected as &s;he was, &s;he could not think of openly avowing her knowledge of Belgrave, to di&s;cover his ba&s;ene&s;s required therefore caution and deliberation, le&s;t in &s;aving Emily from the &s;nare &s;pread for her de&s;truc|tion, &s;he &s;hould entangle her&s;elf in it; to declare at once his real character mu&s;t betray her to him, and tho' &s;he might bani&s;h him from the hou&s;e, yet, un&s;upported as &s;he was by friends or kindred, unable to procure the protection of Ru&s;hbrook, in his pre&s;ent &s;ituation, how|ever willing he might be to extend it; &s;he trembled to think of the dangers to which, by thus di&s;covering, &s;he might expo&s;e her&s;elf to, dangers which the deep trea|chery and daring effrontery of Belgrave would, in all probability, prevent her e&s;caping. As the &s;afe&s;t mea|&s;ure, &s;he re&s;olved on quitting the hou&s;e in the cour&s;e of the day; but without giving an intimation that &s;he meant not to return to it. She recollected a place where there was a probability of her getting lodgings, which would be at once &s;ecret and &s;ecure, and by an anony|mous letter to Captain Ru&s;hbrook, &s;he intended to ac|quaint him of his daughter's danger, and refer him to Sir Charles Bingle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> who&s;e agents he could receive intelligence of him for the truth of what &s;he &s;aid; her plan concerted &s;he grew more compo&s;ed, and was able, when Emily entered the room with her breakfa&s;t, to a&s;k, in a &s;eeming carele&s;s manner, "when Mr. Sip|thorpe was expected back?"</P>

<P>Amanda's anxiety about Emily being equal to what &s;he felt for her&s;elf, &s;he re&s;olved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o leave this letter at Ru&s;hbrook's pri&s;on, le&s;t any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hould happen if it went by other hands.

Emily returned in about an hour and finding Amanda di&s;engaged reque&s;ted permi&s;&s;ion to &s;it with her. Amanda, in her pre&s;ent agitation, would have preferred &s;olitude; but could not decline the com|pany of the affectionate girl, who in conver&s;ing with her &s;ought to forget the heavy cares which the dreadful idea of an union with Sipthorpe had drawn upon her.

they were &s;ummoned to dinner, but Amanda could not think of going to it, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould be &s;een by him.

Thus perpetually threatened with danger, like a frighted bird, again was &s;he to &s;eek a &s;helter for her innocent head.&mdash;She walked with quickne&s;s to Oxford-&s;treet, where &s;he directly procured a carriage, but was &s;o weak and agita|ted, the coachman was almo&s;t obliged to lift her into it. She directed it to the pri&s;on, and on reaching it &s;ent for one of the turnkeys, to whom &s;he gave her letter for Ru&s;hbrook, with a particular charge, to deliver it imme|diately to him. She then ordered the carriage to Pall-Mall, where it may be remembered &s;he had once lodged with lady Grey&s;tock. This was the only lodging-hou&s;e in London &s;he knew, and in it &s;he expected no &s;atisfac|tion but what would be derived from thinking her&s;elf &s;afe, as its mi&s;tre&s;s was a woman of a mo&s;t unplea&s;ant temper. She had once been in affluent circum&s;tances, and the remembrance of tho&s;e circum&s;tances &s;oured her temper, and rendered her, if not incapable of enjoying, at lea&s;t unwilling to acknowledge the ble&s;&s;ings &s;he yet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, on any one in her power &s;he vented her &s;pleen. Her chief pur&s;uit was the gratification of a mo&s;t in&s;a|tiate curio&s;ity, and her fir&s;t delight, relating the affairs, good or bad, which that curio&s;ity dived into. Amanda, finding &s;he was at home, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the coach, and was &s;hewn by the maid into the back parlour, where &s;he &s;at. "Oh! dear!" cried &s;he, with a &s;upercilious &s;mile, the moment Amanda entered, without ri&s;ing from her chair to return her &s;alute, "when did you return to London? and pray, may I a&s;k, what brought you back to it&punc;"</P>
<P>Amanda was now convinced, from Mrs. Han&s;ard's altered manner, who had once been &s;ervile to a degree to
<PB N="62" REF="038416_0633_1011E70646D803A0">
her, that &s;he was perfectly acquainted with her de&s;titute condition, and a heavy &s;igh bur&s;t from her heart at the idea of a&s;&s;ociating with a woman who had the meanne&s;s to treat her ill becau&s;e of that condition. A chilne&s;s crept through her frame when &s;he reflected that her &s;ad &s;ituation might long compel her to this. Sick, weak, exhau&s;ted, &s;he &s;unk upon a chair, which &s;he had nei|ther been offered nor de&s;ired to take.</P>
<P>"Well, Mi&s;s, and pray what is your bu&s;ine&s;s in town?" again a&s;ked Mrs. Han&s;ard, with an increa&s;ed degree of pertne&s;s.</P>
<P>"My bu&s;ine&s;s, Madam," replied Amanda, "can be of no con&s;equence to a per&s;on not connected with me. My bu&s;ine&s;s with you is to know whether you can accom|modate me with lodgings?" "Really; well you might have paid me the compliment of &s;aying you would have called at any rate to know how I did. You may gue&s;s how greatly flattered an humble being like me would be by the notice of &s;o amiable a young lady."</P>
<P>The&s;e words were pronounced with a kind of &s;neer, that, by rou&s;ing the pride of Amanda, a little revived her &s;pirits. "I &s;hould be glad, Madam," &s;aid &s;he, with a compo&s;ed voice, while a faint glow &s;tole over her cheek, "to know whether you can, or chu&s;e to ac|commodate me with lodgings?"</P>
<P>"Lord! my dear," replied Mrs. Han&s;ard, "do not be in &s;uch a wondrous hurry; take a cup of tea with me, and then we will &s;ettle about that bu&s;ine&s;s." The&s;e words implied, that &s;he would comply with the wi&s;h of Amanda, and however di&s;agreeable the a&s;ylum, yet to have &s;ecured one, cheered her &s;inking heart. Tea was &s;oon made, which to Amanda, who had touched nothing &s;ince breakfa&s;t, and but little then, would have been a plea&s;ant refre&s;hment, had &s;he not been tormented and fatigued by the que&s;tions of Mrs. Han&s;ard, who laid a thou&s;and baits to betray her into a full confe&s;&s;ion of what had brought her to London. Amanda, though a &s;tranger in her&s;elf to every &s;pecies of art, from fatal experience was aware of it in others, and therefore guarded her &s;ecret. Mrs. Han&s;ard, who loved what &s;he
<PB N="63" REF="038416_0634_1011E709012EC3D0">
called a go&s;&s;iping cup of tea, &s;at a tedious time over the tea table. Amanda, at la&s;t mortified and alarmed by &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions which dropped from her, again ven|tured to a&s;k if &s;he could be lodged under her roof.</P>
<P>"Are you really &s;erious in that que&s;tion?" &s;aid Mrs. Han&s;ard. There was a certain expre&s;&s;ion of contempt in her features as &s;he &s;poke, which &s;hocked Amanda &s;o much that &s;he had not power to reply: "becau&s;e if you are, my dear," continued Mrs. Han&s;ard, "you have more a&s;&s;urance than I thought y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">u po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, though I always gave you credit for a pretty large &s;hare. Do you think I would ruin my hou&s;e, which lodges people of the fir&s;t rank and character, by admitting you into it; you who, it is well known, obtained Lady Grey&s;tock's protection from charity, and lo&s;t it through mi&s;conduct. Poor Lady, I had the whole &s;tory from her own mouth. She &s;uffered well by having any thing to &s;ay to you: I always gue&s;&s;ed how it would be; notwith&s;tanding your demure look, I &s;aw well enough how you would turn out. I a&s;&s;ure you, to u&s;e your own words, if I could accommodate you in my hou&s;e, it would not an&s;wer you at all, for there are no convenient clo&s;ets in it, in which a lady of your di&s;po&s;ition might now and then want to hide a &s;mart young fellow. I advi&s;e you, if you have had a tiff with any of your friends, to make up the dif|ference, though, indeed, if you do not, in &s;uch a place as London you can never be at a lo&s;s for &s;uch friends. Perhaps you are now beginning to repent of your evil cour&s;es, and if I took you into my hou&s;e, I &s;hould &s;uf|fer as much in my pocket, I &s;uppo&s;e, as in my cha|racter."</P>
<P>The terrified and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed look with which Amanda li&s;tened to this &s;peech, would have &s;topped Mrs. Han&s;ard in the middle of it, had &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;park of humani|ty, even if &s;he believed her (which was not the ca&s;e) guilty; but lo&s;t to the noble, the gentle feelings of hu|manity, &s;he exulted in the triumph of malice, and re|joiced to have an opportunity of piercing the panting heart of helple&s;s innocence with the &s;harp darts of in|&s;ult and unmerited reproach. Amid&s;t the various &s;hocks
<PB N="64" REF="038416_0635_1011E70CA3B5BD28">
Amanda had experienced in the &s;hort but eventful cour&s;e of her life, one greater than the pre&s;ent &s;he had ne|ver felt&mdash;petrified by Mrs. Han&s;ard's words, it was &s;ome time ere &s;he had power to &s;peak. Gracious Hea|ven!" exclaimed &s;he, looking up to that Heaven &s;he ad|dre&s;&s;ed, and which &s;he now con&s;idered her only refuge from evil, "to what trials am I continually expo&s;&s;ed, per&s;ecuted, in&s;ulted, &s;hocked! Oh! what happine&s;s to lay my feeble frame, my woe-&s;truck heart, within that low a&s;ylum, where malice could no more annoy, de|ceit no more betray me! I am happy," &s;he continued, &s;tarting up, and looking at Mrs. Han&s;ard, "that the accommodation I de&s;ired in this hou&s;e you refu&s;ed me, for I am now well convinced, from my knowledge of your di&s;po&s;ition, that the &s;ecurity my &s;ituation requires I &s;hould not have found within it." She ha&s;tily quitted the room, but on entering the hall her &s;pirits entirely for&s;ook her, at the dreadful idea of having no home to go to; overcome with horror, &s;he &s;unk in a flood of tears upon one of the hall chairs. A maid, who had probably been li&s;tening to her mi&s;tre&s;s's conver&s;ation, now came from a front parlour, and, as Mrs. Han&s;ard had &s;hut the door after Amanda, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ddre&s;&s;ed her without fear of being overheard. "Ble&s;s me! Mi&s;s," &s;aid &s;he, "are you crying? Why, Lord! &s;urely you will not mind what old blow&s;ey in the parlour &s;ays? I promi&s;e you, if we minded her, we &s;hould have red eyes here every day in the week. Do pray, Mi&s;s, tell me if I can be of any &s;ervice to you?"</P>
<P>Amanda in a voice &s;carcely articulate, thanked her, and &s;aid, "in a few minutes &s;he &s;hould be better able to &s;peak." To &s;eek lodgings at this late hour was not to be thought of, except &s;he wi&s;hed to run into the very dangers &s;he had wanted to avoid, and Mrs. Connel's hou&s;e returned to her recollection, as the impo&s;&s;ibility of procuring a refuge in any other was confirmed in her mind; &s;he began to think it could not be &s;o dangerous as her fears in the morning had repre&s;ented it to be; ere this &s;he thought Belgrave (for &s;ince the delivery of the letter there had been time enough for &s;uch a pro|ceeding)
<PB N="65" REF="038416_0636_1011E70F3A385F88">
might be bani&s;hed from it, if not, &s;he had a chance of concealing her&s;elf, and even if di&s;covered, &s;he believed Mrs. Connel would protect her from his open in&s;ults, whil&s;t &s;he tru&s;ted her own precaution would, under Heaven, defeat his &s;ecret &s;chemes, &s;hould he again contrive any; &s;he therefore re&s;olved, or ra|ther nece&s;&s;ity compelled her, for could &s;he have a|voided it, &s;he would not have done &s;o, to return to Mrs. Connel's; &s;he accordingly reque&s;ted the maid to procure her a carriage, and rewarded her for her trouble. As &s;he was returning to Mrs. Connel's, &s;he endeavoured to calm her &s;pirits, and quell her apprehen&s;ions. When the carriage &s;topped, and the maid appeared, &s;he could &s;carcely prevent her&s;elf ere &s;he alighted from enquiring whether any one but the family was within; con&s;cious, however, that &s;uch a que&s;tion might create &s;u&s;picions, and that &s;u&s;picions would naturally excite enquiries, &s;he checked her&s;elf, and re-entered, though with trem|bling limbs, that hou&s;e from whence in the morning &s;he had fled with &s;uch terror.</P>

<P>AMANDA had not reached the parlour when the door opened, and Mrs. Connel came from it. "Oh! oh! Mi&s;s," cried &s;he, "&s;o you are returned; I prote&s;t I was beginning to think you had &s;tolen a march upon us." There was a rude bluntne&s;s in this &s;peech which
<PB N="66" REF="038416_0637_1011E711D17AA3D0">
confounded Amanda; and her mind mi&s;gave her that all was not right. "Come," continued Mrs. Connel, "come in, Mi&s;s, I a&s;&s;ure you I have been very impatient for your return." Amanda's fears increa&s;ed. She follow|ed Mrs. Connel in &s;ilence into the parlour, where &s;he beheld an elderly woman, of a plea&s;ing but emaciated appearance, who &s;eemed in great agitation and di&s;tre&s;s: How &s;he could po&s;&s;ibly have any thing to &s;ay to this woman &s;he could not conjecture, and yet an idea that &s;he had in&s;tantly darted into her mind, &s;he &s;at down trembling in every limb, and waited with impatience for an explanation of this &s;cence. After a general &s;ilence of a few minutes, the &s;tranger looking at Amanda, &s;aid, "My daughter, Madam, has informed me we are in|debted to your bounty, I am therefore happy at an op|portunity of di&s;charging the debt. The&s;e words an|nounced Mrs. Ru&s;hbrook, but Amanda was confounded at her manner; its coldne&s;s and formality were more ex|pre&s;&s;ive of di&s;like and &s;everity, than of gentlene&s;s or gratitude. Mrs. Ru&s;hbrook ro&s;e as &s;he &s;poke, and of|fered a note to her. Speechle&s;s from a&s;toni&s;hment, A|manda had not power either to decline or accept it, and it was laid on a table before her.</P>
<P>"Allow me, Madam," &s;aid Mrs. Ru&s;hbrook, as &s;he re&s;umed her &s;eat, "to a&s;k if your real name is Donald?" Amanda's pre&s;entiment of underhand doings was now verified; it was evident to her that their author was Bel|grave, and that he had been too &s;ucce&s;sful in contriving them.</P>
<P>Amanda now appeared to have reached the cri&s;is of her fate; in all the various trials &s;ha had hitherto expe|rienced, &s;he had &s;till &s;ome &s;tay, &s;ome hope, to &s;upport her weakne&s;s, and &s;oothe her &s;orrows, when groaning under the injuries her character &s;u&s;tained by the &s;ucce&s;s of an execrable plot, &s;he had the con&s;olation to think an idolizing father would &s;helter her from farther in&s;ult; when deprived of that father, tender friends &s;tepped for|ward, who mingled tears of &s;ympathy with her's, and poured the balm of pity on her &s;orrowing heart; when torn from the beloved object en&s;hrined within that heart

while her &s;ick &s;oul langui&s;hed under the heavy burthen of exi&s;tence, again did the voice of friend&s;hip penetrate its gloom, and, though it could not remove, alleviated its &s;ufferings; now helple&s;s, unprotected, &s;he &s;aw a dreadful &s;torm ready to bur&s;t over he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> devoted head, without one hope to cheer, one &s;trethed out arm to &s;hield her from its violence; &s;urrounded by &s;trangers, prejudiced again&s;t her, &s;he could not think that her plain, unvarni&s;hed tale would gain their credence, or prevail on them to protect her from the wretch, who&s;e machinations had ruined her in their e&s;timation; the horrors of her &s;ituation all at once a&s;&s;ailing her mind overpowered its faculties, a kind of mental &s;ickne&s;s &s;eized her, &s;he leaned her throbbing head upon her hand, and a deep groan bur&s;t from her agonized heart.</P>
<P>You &s;ee," &s;aid Mrs. Connel, after a long &s;ilence, "&s;he cannot brave this di&s;covery."</P>
<P>Amanda rai&s;ed her head at the&s;e words; &s;he had grown a little more compo&s;ed. "The Being in whom I tru&s;t," &s;he &s;aid to her&s;elf, "and whom I never wilfully offended, will &s;till, I doubt not, as heretofore, protect me from danger." Mrs. Ru&s;hbrook's unan&s;wered que&s;|tion &s;till &s;ounded in her ear. "Allow me, Madam," &s;he cried, turning to her, "to a&s;k your rea&s;on for en|quiring whether my real name is Donald?"</P>
<P>"Oh, Lord! my dear," &s;aid Mrs. Connel, addre&s;&s;ing Mrs. Ru&s;hbrook," you need not pe&s;ter your&s;elf or her with any more que&s;tions about the matter, her que&s;tion is an an&s;wer in it&s;elf."</P>
<P>"I am of your opinion, indeed," exclaimed Mrs. Ru&s;hbrook, "and think any farther enquiry needle&s;s."</P>
<P>"I acknowledge, Madam," &s;aid Amanda, who&s;e voice grew firmer from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of never hav|ing acted improperly, "that my name is not Donald. I mu&s;t al&s;o do my&s;elf the ju&s;tice to declare (let me be cre|dited or not) that my real one was not concealed from any motive which could de&s;erve reproach or cen&s;ure.&mdash;My &s;ituation is peculiarly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing.

<P><PB N="68" REF="038416_0639_1011E715EC046308">
"I do not want, Madam," replied Mrs. Ru&s;hbrook' "to enquire into your &s;ituation; you have been candid in one in&s;tance, I hope you will be eqally &s;o in another. Pray, Madam," handing to Amanda the letter &s;he had written to Ru&s;hbrook, "is this your writing?"</P>
<P>"Yes Madam, an&s;wered Amanda, who&s;e pride was rou&s;ed by the contempt &s;he met, "it is my wri|ting."</P>
<P>"And pray," &s;aid Mrs. Ru&s;hbrook, looking &s;ted|fa&s;tly at her, while her voice grew more &s;evere, "what was your motive for writing this letter?"</P>
<P>"I think Madam," cried Amanda, "the letter ex|plains that."</P>
<P>"A pretty explanation, truly! exclaimed Mrs. Con|nel; "and &s;o you would try to villify the poor gentle|man's character; but, Mi&s;s we have had an explanation you little dream of; aye we found you out, notwith|&s;tanding your &s;lyne&s;s in writing like one of the Ma|dam's in a Novel, a bit of a letter without ever a name to it. Mr. Sipthorpe knew directly who it came from. Ah! poor gentleman he allowed you wit enough, a pity there is not more goodne&s;s with it; he knows you very well to his co&s;t."</P>
<P>"Yes," &s;aid Amanda, "he knows I am a being who&s;e happine&s;s he di&s;turbed, but who&s;e innocence he never triumphed over. He knows that like an evil Ge|nii, he has pur&s;ued my wandering foot&s;teps, heaping &s;orrow upon &s;orrow on me by his machination; but he al&s;o knows, when encompa&s;&s;ed with tho&s;e &s;orrows, per|plexed with tho&s;e machinations, I ro&s;e &s;uperior to them all, and with uniform contempt and abhorrence re|jected his offers."</P>

She then proceeded to relate every thing &s;he knew concerning Belgrave; but &s;he had the mortification to find her &s;hort and &s;imple &s;tory re|ceived with every mark of incredulity. "Beware, Madam," &s;aid &s;he to Mrs. Ru&s;hbrook, "of this infa|tuation, I adjure you beware of the con&s;equences of it; Oh! doom not your innocent, your reluctant Emily to de&s;truction; draw not upon your own head by &s;uch a deed horrible and excruciating angui&s;h.

I know from fal&s;e repre&s;enta|tions, you think me a poor mi&s;guided creature; but was I even &s;o, my too evident angui&s;h might &s;urely have excited pity.

Oh! Madam, I once looked forward to a meeting with you far, far different from the pre&s;ent one: I once flattered my&s;elf that from the generous friend&s;hip of Mr. and Mrs. Ru&s;hbrook, I &s;hould derive &s;upport and con&s;olation; but this like eve|ry other hope, is di&s;appointed."&mdash;Amanda's voice faul|tered

<P>"For my part I wonder you &s;poke &s;o mildly to her," exclaimed Mrs. Connel: "I prote&s;t in future I &s;hall be guarded who I admit into my hou&s;e.

<P>Mrs. Connel ro&s;e as &s;he &s;poke, and approached her with a look, which &s;eemed to &s;ay &s;he would put her threat into execution. It was Amanda's intention to quit the hou&s;e the next morning; but to be turned from it at &s;uch an hour, a wanderer in the &s;treet, the idea was replete with horror!"&mdash;She &s;tarted up, and retreat|ing a few paces, looked at Mrs. Connel with a kind of melancholy wildne&s;s.

Oh! would to Heaven," cried &s;he, cla&s;ping her hands together, and bur&s;ting into an agony of tears, "before to-morrow I could be rid of the heavy burthen that oppre&s;&s;es me!</P>
<P>"Well, we have had wailing and weeping enough to night," &s;aid Mrs. Connel, "&s;o, Mi&s;s you may take one of the candles off the table, and go to your chamber if you chu&s;e."</P>
<P>Amanda did not require to have this permi&s;&s;ion re|peated. She aro&s;e, and taking the light left the parlour. With feeble &s;teps &s;he a&s;cended to the little chamber&punc; but here all was dark and &s;olitary; no cheerful fire &s;ent forth an animating blaze, no gentle Emily, like the mild genius of benevolence, appeared to offer, with undi&s;&s;em|bled kindne&s;s, her little attentions, for&s;aken, faint, the pale child of mi&s;ery laid down the candle, and &s;eating her&s;elf at th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> foot of the bed, gave way to deep and agonizing &s;orrow.</P>
<P>"Was I ever," &s;he a&s;ked her&s;elf, "ble&s;&s;ed with friends who valued my exi&s;tence as their own, who called me the beloved of their hearts? Oh, yes, &s;he groaned, once &s;uch frinds were mine, and the &s;ad remembrance of them aggravates my pre&s;ent mi&s;ery. Oh! happy is our ignorance of futurity. Oh!

opened; &s;he turned her eyes to it in expectation of &s;ee|ing Emily, but was di&s;appointed on perceiving only the maid of the hou&s;e. "Oh! dear ma'am," cried &s;he, go|ing up to Amanda, "I declare it quite grieves me to &s;ee you in &s;uch a &s;ituation. Poor Mi&s;s Emily is in ju&s;t as &s;ad a plight. Well, it is no matter, but I think both the old ladies will be puni&s;hed for plaguing you in this manner. Madam Ru&s;hbrook will be &s;orry enough, when, after giving her daughter to Mr. Sipthorpe, &s;he finds he is not what he &s;eems to be." Amanda &s;hrunk with horror from the idea of Emily's de&s;truction, and by a motion of her hand &s;ignified to the maid her di&s;|like to the &s;ubject. "Well, Ma'am," &s;he continued, "Mi&s;s Emily, as I was &s;aying, is quite in as bad a plight as your&s;elf; they have clapped her into my mi&s;tre&s;s's chamber, which &s;he dur&s;t not leave without running the ri&s;k of bringing their tongues upon her: However &s;he contrived to &s;ee me, and &s;ent you this note.

<LETTER>
<P>I hope my dear Mi&s;s Donald will not doubt my &s;in|cerity, when I declare that all my &s;orrows are heighten|ed by knowing I have been the occa&s;ion of trouble to her. I have heard of the unworthy treatment &s;he has received in this hou&s;e, and her intention of quitting it to-morrow; knowing her aver&s;ene&s;s to lodge in a place &s;he is unacquainted with, I have been &s;peaking to the maid about her, and had the &s;atisfaction to hear, that, through her means, my dear Mi&s;s Donald might be &s;afe|ly accommodated for a &s;hort time, long enough, howe|ver, to permit her to look out for an eligible &s;ituation. I refer her for particulars of the conver&s;ation to the maid, who&s;e fidelity may be relied on. To think it may be u&s;e|ful to my dear Mi&s;s Donald affords me the only plea&s;ure I am now capable of enjoying.

"Why Ma'am," &s;aid the maid, "I have a &s;i&s;ter who is hou&s;e maid at a very grand place on the Rich|mond road. All the family are now gone to Brighton, and &s;he is left alone in the hou&s;e, where you would be very welcome to take up your re&s;idence till you could get one to your mind. My &s;i&s;ter is a &s;age &s;ober body, and would do every thing in her power to plea&s;e and oblige you, and you would be as &s;nug and &s;ecure with her as in a hou&s;e of your own; and poor Mi&s;s Emily begged you would go to her, till you could get lodgings with people who&s;e characters you know, and indeed, Ma'am, it is my humble opinion it would be &s;afe and plea&s;ant for you to do &s;o, and if you con&s;ent I will con|duct you there to-morrow morning, and I am &s;ure, Ma'am, I &s;hall be happy if I have the power of &s;erving you." Like the Lady in Comus, Amanda might have &s;aid,

<L>To my proportion'd &s;trength.</L></Q></P>
<P>To take refuge in this manner in any one's hou&s;e was truly repugnant to the feelings of Amanda; but &s;ad ne|ce&s;&s;ity conquered her &s;crupulous delicacy, and &s;he a&s;ked the maid "at what hour in the mourning &s;he &s;hould be ready for her?"</P>
<P>"I &s;hall come to you, Ma'am," an&s;wered &s;he, "as &s;oon as I think there is a carriage on the &s;tand, and then we can go together to get one; but I prote&s;t, Ma'am, you look &s;adly; I wi&s;h you would allow me to a&s;&s;i&s;t in undre&s;&s;ing you, for I am &s;ure you want a little re&s;t; I dare &s;ay, for all my mi&s;tre&s;s &s;aid, if you cho&s;e it, I could get a little wine from her to make whey for you." A|manda refu&s;ed this, but accepted her offer of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, for &s;he was &s;o overpowered by the &s;cenes of the day, as
<PB N="74" REF="038416_0645_1011E722457EEBE0">
to be almo&s;t unequal to any exertion. The maid retir|ed after &s;he had &s;een her to bed. Amanda entreated her to be punctual to an early hour and al&s;o reque&s;ted her to give her mo&s;t affectionate love to Mi&s;s Ru&s;hbrook, and her &s;incere thanks for the kind &s;olicitude &s;he had expre&s;&s;ed about her. Her re&s;t was now as on the pre|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ding night, broken and di&s;turbed by frightful vi&s;ions. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ro&s;e, pale trembling and unrefre&s;hed. The maid came to her &s;oon after &s;he was dre&s;&s;ed, and &s;he immedi|ately accompanied her down &s;tairs, trembling as &s;he went, le&s;t Belgrave &s;hould &s;uddely make his appear|ance, and either prevent her departure, or follow her to her new re&s;idence. She left the hou&s;e, however, with|out meeting any creature, and &s;oon obtained the &s;helter of a carriage.</P>
<P>As they proceeded Amanda be&s;ought the maid, who &s;eemed perfectly acquainted with every thing relative to Belgrave, to tell Mi&s;s Ru&s;hbrook to believe her a&s;&s;er|tions again&s;t him, if &s;he wi&s;hed to &s;ave her&s;elf from de&s;truction. The maid a&s;&s;ured her &s;he would, and de|clared &s;he always &s;u&s;pected Mr. Sipthorpe was not as good as he &s;hould be. Amanda &s;oon found her&s;elf at the end of her little journey. The hou&s;e was elegant and &s;pacious, with a &s;hort avenue before it, planted with che&s;nuts. The maid's &s;i&s;ter was an elderly plain-look|ing woman, who received Amanda with every appear|ance of re&s;pect, and conducted her into a hand&s;ome par|lour, where a neat breakfa&s;t was laid out. "I took care, Ma'am, &s;aid the maid, &s;miling, "to appri&s;e my &s;i&s;ter la&s;t night of the honour &s;he was to have this morn|ing, and I am &s;ure &s;he will do every thing in her power to oblige you."</P>
<P>"I thank you both," cried Amanda, with her u&s;ual &s;weetne&s;s; but while &s;he &s;poke a &s;traggling tear &s;tole down her lovely cheek at the idea of that forlorn &s;itua|tion, which had thus ca&s;t her upon the kindne&s;s of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="5 letters">|gers, &s;trangers who were them&s;elves the children of po|verty and dependence: "I hope, however," &s;he conti|nu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d, "I &s;hall not long be a trouble to either, as it is my intention immediately to look out for a lodging a|mong&s;t

the cottages in this neighbourhood till I can &s;et|tle my affairs to return to my friends. In the mean time I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t on making &s;ome recompence for the attention I have received, and the expence I have put you to." She accordingly forced a pre&s;ent upon each, for both the women appeared unwilling to accept them, and Mrs. Deborah, the maid's &s;i&s;ter, &s;aid "it was quite unnece&s;&s;ary at pre&s;ent to think of leaving the hou&s;e, as the family would not return to it for &s;ix weeks."&mdash;Amanda, however was re&s;olved on doing what &s;he had &s;aid, as &s;he could not conquer the repugnance &s;he felt to continue in a &s;trangers hou&s;e. Mrs. Connel's maid de|parted in a few minutes; of the breakfa&s;t prepared for her, Amanda could only take &s;ome tea; her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ached violently, and her whole frame felt di&s;ordered. Mrs. Deborah &s;eeing her dejection, propo&s;ed &s;hewing her the hou&s;e and garden, which was very fine, to amu&s;e her; but Amanda declined the propo&s;al at pre&s;ent, &s;ay|ing, "&s;he thought if &s;he lay down &s;he &s;hould be bet|ter." She was immediately conducted to an elegant chamber, where Mrs. Deborah left her, &s;aying, "&s;he would prepare &s;ome little nice thing for her dinner, which &s;he hoped would tempt her to eat."</P>
<P>Amanda now tried to compo&s;e her &s;pirits by reflect|ing &s;he was in a place of &s;ecurity; but their agitation was not to be &s;ubdued from the &s;leep into which mere fatigue had threw her; &s;he was continually &s;tarting in inexpre&s;&s;ible terrors. Mrs. Deborah came up two or three times to know how &s;he was, and at la&s;t appeared with dinner. She laid a &s;mall table by the bed&s;ide, and be&s;ought Amanda to ri&s;e and try to eat; there was a friendline&s;s in her manner, which recalled to Amanda's recollection her faithful nur&s;e Edwin, and &s;he &s;ighed to think that the &s;helter of her humble cottage &s;he could no more enjoy (&s;hould &s;uch a &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ter to be required) from its vicinity to Tudor-Hall, nea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> which every feeling of tenderne&s;s and propriety mu&s;t forbid her re&s;iding; the &s;ad remembrance which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ow revived in her mind drew tears from h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r, and rendered her unable to eat.

She &s;tarted, for &s;he thought it was a voice familiar to her ear; with a light foot and throbbing heart &s;he turned into a parlour at the foot of the &s;tairs which communicated with the other. Here &s;he li&s;tened, and &s;oon had her fears confirmed by recollecting the voice to be that of Belgrave's &s;ervant, whom &s;he had often &s;een in Devon&s;hire. She li&s;tened with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> kind of horror, which the trembling wretch may be &s;uppo&s;ed to feel when about hearing a &s;entence he expects to be dreadful.</P>
<P>"Aye, I a&s;&s;ure you," cried the man, "we are blown up at Mrs. Connel's, but that is of little con&s;equence to us; the Colonel thinks the game now in view better than that he has lo&s;t, &s;o to night you may expect him in a chai&s;e and four to carry off your fair gue&s;t."</P>
<P>"I declare I am glad of it," &s;aid Mrs. Deborah; "for I think &s;he will die &s;oon."</P>
<P>"Die &s;oon! repeated he. "Oh! yes indeed; great danger of that; and he added &s;omething el&s;e, which being delivered with a violent bur&s;t of laughter, Aman|da could not hear; &s;he thought &s;he heard them moving towards the door; &s;he in&s;tantly &s;lipped from the parlour, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d a&s;cending the &s;tairs in breathle&s;s ha&s;te, &s;topped out|&s;ide the chamber door to li&s;ten. In a few minutes &s;he heard them coming into the hall, and the man &s;oftly let out by Mrs. Deborah. Amanda now entered the cham|ber, and clo&s;ed the door, and knowing a guilty con&s;ci|ence is ea&s;ily alarmed, &s;he threw her&s;elf on the bed, le&s;t Mrs. Deborah, if &s;he found her up, &s;hould have her &s;u&s;|picions awakened. Her de&s;perate &s;ituation in&s;pired her with &s;trength and courage, and &s;he tru&s;ted, by pre&s;ence of mind, to be able to extricate her&s;elf from it; it was her intention, if &s;he effected her e&s;cape, to proceed di|rectly to London, though the idea of entering it without

a certain place to go to, was &s;hocking to her imagination yet &s;he thought it a more &s;ecure place for her than any of the neighbouring cottages, which might be &s;earched. Mrs. Deborah, as &s;he expected, &s;oon came up to her&mdash;Amanda involuntarily &s;huddered at her appearance, but knowing her &s;afety depended on the concealment of her feelings, &s;he forced her&s;elf to conver&s;e with the treacher|ous creature. She at la&s;t aro&s;e from the bed, declaring &s;he had indulged her langour too much, and after a few turns about the room, went to the window, and pretended to be engro&s;&s;ed in admiring the garden. "There is a great deal of fruit in the garden" &s;aid &s;he, turning to Mrs. Deborah; "if I did not think it encroaching too much on your kindne&s;s, I &s;hould a&s;k you for a nectarine or two"</P>
<P>"Dear Ma'am," replied Mrs. Deborah, "you are heartily welcome. I declare I &s;hould have offered them to you, only I thought you would like a turn in the garden and pull them your&s;elf."</P>
<P>"No," &s;aid Amanda, "I cannot at pre&s;ent." Mrs. Deborah went off, and Amanda watched at the window till &s;he &s;aw her at the very end of the garden; &s;he then &s;natched up her hat, and tied it on with a handkerchief, better to conceal her face, then ha&s;tily de&s;cended the &s;tairs, and locked the back door to prevent an immedi|ate pur&s;uit. She ran down the avenue, nor flagged in her cour&s;e till &s;he had got &s;ome paces from it; &s;he was then compelled to do &s;o, as much from weakne&s;s as from fear of attracting notice, if &s;he went on in &s;uch a wild manner. She &s;tarted at the &s;ound of every carriage, and ha&s;tily averted her head as they pa&s;&s;ed; but &s;he reached London without any alarm but what her own fears gave her. The hour was now late and gloomy, and warned Amanda of the nece&s;&s;ity there was for ex|ertions to procure a lodging. Some poor women &s;he &s;aw retiring from their little fruit &s;tands drew a &s;hower of tears from her, to think her &s;ituation was more wretch|ed than theirs, whom but a few days before &s;he &s;hould have con&s;idered as objects of compa&s;&s;ion. She knew at &s;uch an hour &s;he would only be received into hou&s;es of
<PB N="78" REF="038416_0649_1011E72D2F507510">
an inferior de&s;cription, and looked for one in which &s;he could think there might be a chance of gaining admit|tance. She at la&s;t came to a &s;mall mean looking hou&s;e: "This humble roof, I think," cried <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he, "will not di&s;|dain to &s;helter an unhappy wanderer!" She turned into the &s;hop, where butter and chee&s;e were di&s;played, and where an elderly woman &s;at knitting behind the counter. She ro&s;e immediately, as if from &s;urpri&s;e and re&s;pect at Amanda's appearance, who in univer&s;al agitation leaned again&s;t the door for &s;upport, unable for &s;ome minutes to &s;peak. At la&s;t, in faultering accents, whil&s;t over her pale face a crim&s;on blu&s;h was diffu&s;ed, &s;he &s;aid, "I &s;hould be glad to know if you have any lodgings to let?"</P>
<P>The woman in&s;tantly dropped into her &s;eat, and look|ing &s;tedfa&s;tly at Amanda, "This is a &s;trange hour," cried &s;he, "for any decent body to come looking for lodgings!"</P>
<P>"I am as &s;en&s;ible of that as you can be," &s;aid A|manda; "but peculiar circum&s;tances have obliged me to it: if you can accommodate me, I can a&s;&s;ure you you will not have rea&s;on to repent doing &s;o."</P>
<P>"Oh! I do not know how that may be," cried &s;he; "it is natural for a body to &s;peak a good word for them|&s;elves; however, if I do let you a room, for I have on|ly one to &s;pare, I &s;hall expect to be paid for it before|hand"</P>
<P>"You &s;hall indeed," &s;aid Amanda.</P>
<P>"Well, I will &s;hew it you," &s;aid &s;he. She accord|ingly called a little girl to watch the &s;hop, and taking a candle went up, before Amanda, a narrow winding flight o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;tairs, and conducted her into a room, who&s;e dirty, mi&s;erable appearance made her involuntarily &s;hrink back, as if from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of wretchedne&s;s it&s;elf. She tried to &s;ubdue the di&s;gu&s;t it in&s;pired her with, by reflecting that, after the imminent danger &s;he had e&s;caped, &s;he &s;hould be happy to procure any a&s;ylum &s;he could con&s;ider &s;afe; &s;he al&s;o tried to reconcile her&s;elf to it, by reflect|ing that in the morning &s;he &s;hould quit it.</P>
<P>"Well, Ma'am," &s;aid the woman, the price of this room is neither more nor le&s;s than one guinea per week,
<PB N="79" REF="038416_0650_1011E731CCE6A490">
and if you do not like it, you are very welcome not to &s;tay."</P>
<P>"I have no objection to the price," replied Amanda; "but I hope you have quiet people in the hou&s;e."</P>
<P>"I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">latter my&s;elf Ma'am," &s;aid the woman, drawing up her head, "there is never a hou&s;e in the pari&s;h can boa&s;t a better name than mine."</P>
<P>"I am glad to hear it," an&s;wered Amanda, "and I hope you are not offended by the enquiry." She now put her hand in her pocket for the pur&s;e, to give the expected guinea; but the pur&s;e was not there. She &s;at down on the &s;ide of the bed and &s;earched the other, but with a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> little &s;ucce&s;s. She pulled out the contents of both, but no pur&s;e was to be found. "Now&mdash;now," cried &s;he, cla&s;ping her hands together, in an agony which precluded reflection, "now&mdash;now, I am lo&s;t in|deed! My pur&s;e is &s;tolen," &s;he continued, "and I can|not give you the promi&s;ed guinea."</P>
<P>"No, nor never could, I &s;uppo&s;e," exclaimed the wo|man. Ah! I &s;u&s;pected all along what you were; and &s;o you were glad my hou&s;e had a good name? I &s;hall take care it does not lo&s;e that name by lodging you."</P>
<P>"I conjure you, cried Amanda, &s;tarting up and lay|ing her hand on the woman's, "I conjure you to let me &s;tay this night; you will not, you &s;hall not lo&s;e by do|ing &s;o. I have things of value in a trunk in town, for which I will this in&s;tant give you a direction."</P>
<P>"Your trunk!" replied the woman, in a &s;cornful tone, "oh! yes, you have a trunk with things of value in it as much as you have a pur&s;e in your pocket. A pretty &s;tory indeed; but I know too much of the ways of the world to be deceived now a days&mdash;&s;o march directly."</P>
<P>Amanda again began to entreat, but the woman in|terrupted her, and declared, "if &s;he did not depart di|rectly &s;he would be &s;orry for it."&mdash;Amanda in&s;tantly cea&s;ed her importunities, and in trembling &s;ilence fol|lowed her down &s;tairs.&mdash;Oppre&s;&s;ed with weakne&s;s &s;he involuntarily he&s;itated in the &s;hop, which the woman perceiving, &s;he rudely &s;eized her, and pu&s;hing her from it &s;hut the door. Amanda could not now, as in former

exigencies, con&s;ider what was to be done. Alas! if even capable of reflection, it could have &s;ugge&s;ted no plan, which there was a hope of accompli&s;hing, the powers of her mind were overwhelmed with horror and angui&s;h; &s;he moved mechanically along, nor &s;topped, till from weakne&s;s &s;he &s;unk upon the &s;tep of a door, again&s;t which &s;he leaned her head in a kind of letharg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">; but from this &s;he was &s;uddenly rou&s;ed by two men who &s;topped before her. Death alone could have conquered her terrors of Belgrave. She in&s;tantly concluded the&s;e to be him and his man. She &s;tarted up, uttered a faint &s;cream, and, calling upon heaven to defend her, was &s;pringing pa&s;t them, when her hand was &s;uddenly caught. She made a feeble but un&s;ucce&s;sful effort to di&s;engage it, and overcome by terror and weakne&s;s, fell though not fainting, unable to &s;upport her&s;elf, up|on the bo&s;om of him who had arre&s;ted her cour&s;e:&mdash;"Gracious Heaven!" cried he, "I have heard that voice before."</P>
<P>Amanda rai&s;ed her head:&mdash;"Sir Charles Bingley!" &s;he exclaimed. The feelings of joy, &s;urpri&s;e, and &s;hame, that pervaded her whole &s;oul, and thrilled through her frame, were in its pre&s;ent weak &s;tate too much for it, and &s;he again &s;unk upon his &s;houlder. The joy of un|expected protection, for protection &s;he was convinced &s;he would receive from Sir Charles Bingley, was con|quered by reflecting on the injurious ideas her pre&s;ent &s;ituation mu&s;t excite in his mind, ideas &s;he feared &s;he &s;hould never be able to remove, &s;o &s;trongly were ap|pearances again&s;t her.</P>
<P>"Gracious Heaven!" exclaimed Sir Charles, "is this Mi&s;s Fitzalan&punc; Oh! this," he cried, in a tone of deep dejection, "is indeed a meeting of horror!" A deep convul&s;ive &s;ob from Amanda alone proclaimed her &s;en&s;ibility, for &s;he lay motionle&s;s in his arms, arms which involuntarily encircled and enfolded her to a heart that throbbed with intolerable angui&s;h on her ac|count. His friend &s;tood all this time a &s;ilent &s;pecta|tor of the &s;ce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, the raillery which he had been on the point of uttering at &s;eeing Amanda, as he thought &s;o

premeditatedly fall into the arms of his companion, was &s;topped by the &s;udden exclamation of Sir Charles, though the face of Amanda was concealed, the glimmering of a lamp over their heads gave him a view of her fine form, and the countenance of Sir Charles, as he bent over her, full of &s;orrow and di&s;may.</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s Fitzalan," cried Sir Charles, after the &s;ilence of a minute, "you are ill, allow me to have the plea|&s;ure of &s;eeing you home."</P>
<P>"Home!" repeated Amanda, in the &s;low and hol|low voice of de&s;pair, and rai&s;ing her languid head, "Alas! I have no home to go to."</P>
<P>Every &s;urmi&s;e of horror which Sir Charles had formed from &s;eeing her in her pre&s;ent &s;ituation was now con|firmed. He groaned&mdash;he &s;huddered, and &s;carcely able to &s;tand was obliged to lean with the lovely burthen he &s;upported again&s;t the rails. He be&s;ought his friend ei|ther to procure a chair, or coach, in which he might have her conveyed to a hou&s;e where he knew he could gain her admittance. Touched by his di&s;tre&s;s, and the powerful impul&s;e of humanity, his friend in&s;tantly went to comply with his reque&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;ilence of Amanda Sir Charles imputed to &s;hame and illne&s;s, and grief and delicacy forbad him to notice it. His friend returned in a few minutes with a coach, and Sir Charles then found that Amanda's &s;ilence did not altogether proceed from the motives he had a&s;cribed it to, for &s;he had fainted on his bo&s;om. She was lifted in|to the carriage, and he again received her in his arms. On the carriage &s;topping he committed her to the care of his friend, whil&s;t he &s;tepped into the hou&s;e to procure her a reception. In a few minutes he retur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">d with a maid, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in carrying her up &s;tairs; but on entering the drawing-room, how great was his amaze|ment when a voice &s;uddenly exclaimed, "Oh, merciful Powers! this is Mi&s;s Donald!" it was indeed to Mrs. Connel's hou&s;e, and to the care of the Ru&s;hbrooks, whom his bounty had relea&s;ed from pri&s;on, he had brought her. He had previou&s;ly informed them of the
<PB N="82" REF="038416_0653_1011E737ACB461B8">
&s;ituation in which he found her, little &s;u&s;pecting at the time &s;he was the Mi&s;s Donald they mentioned being un|der &s;uch obligations to.</P>
<P>"It is I, it is I," cried Mrs. Ru&s;hbrook, gazing on her with mingled horror and angui&s;h, "it is I have been the occa&s;ion of her di&s;tre&s;s, and never &s;hall I forgive my&s;elf for it.</P>
<P>"Oh! my pre&s;erver, my friend, my benefactre&s;s," &s;aid Emily, cla&s;ping her in an agony of tears to her bo|&s;om, "is it thus your Emily beholds you!" Amanda was laid upon a couch, and her h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t being removed, di&s;|played a face which, with the palene&s;s of death, had all the wildne&s;s of de&s;pair, a wildne&s;s that denoted more ex|pre&s;&s;ively than language could have done the conflicts her &s;pirit had endured; heavy &s;ighs announced her hav|ing recovered from her fainting fit; but her eyes &s;till continued clo&s;ed, and her head too weak to be &s;elf &s;up|ported, re&s;ted again&s;t the arm of the couch. Mrs. Ru&s;h|brook and her daughter hung over her in inexpre&s;&s;ible agonies. "If they were thus affected, oh! how was Sir Charles Bingley di&s;tre&s;&s;ed: Oh! how was the heart, which loved her with the mo&s;t impa&s;&s;ioned tenderne&s;s, agonized." As he bent over the couch, the big tear trickled down his manly cheek and fell upon the cold pale face he contemplated. He &s;oftly a&s;ked him&s;elf, "Is this Amanda! Is this &s;he, whom but a &s;hort time ago I beheld moving with unequalled elegance, adorned with unrivalled beauty, whom my heart wor&s;hipped as the fir&s;t of women, and &s;ought to unite its de&s;tiny to as the &s;ure&s;t means of rendering that de&s;tiny happy? Oh! what a change is here! How feeble is that form&mdash;how hollow is that cheek&mdash;how heavy are tho&s;e eyes, who&s;e languid glance &s;peak incurable angui&s;h of &s;oul! Oh, A|manda! was the being pre&s;ent, who fir&s;t led you into er|ror, what horror and remor&s;e mu&s;t &s;eize his &s;oul at &s;ee|ing the con&s;equence of that error!" "Has this unhap|py young creature," a&s;ked Ru&s;hbrook, who had ap|proached the couch, and viewed her with the true&s;t pity, "no connexions that could be prevailed on to &s;ave her."</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="038416_0654_1011E73B67BDCC30">
"None that I know of," replied Sir Charles; "her parents are both dead."</P>
<P>"Happy are the parents," re&s;umed Ru&s;hbrook, "who &s;hrouded in the du&s;t, cannot &s;ee the misfortunes of their children&mdash;the fall of &s;uch a child as this!" glancing his tearful eyes as he &s;poke on his daughters.</P>
<P>"And pray, Sir," &s;aid Mrs. Connel, who was chafing her temples with lavender, "if &s;he recovers, what is to become of her?</P>
<P>"It &s;hall be my care," cried Sir Charles, "to pro|cure an a&s;ylum. Yes, Amanda," he continued, look|ing at her with an expre&s;&s;ion of mingled tenderne&s;s and grief, "he that mu&s;t for ever mourn thy fate, will try to mitigate it; but does &s;he not want medical a&s;&s;i&s;|tance!"</P>
<P>"I think not," replied Mrs. Connel; "it is want of nouri&s;hment and re&s;t has thrown her into her pre&s;ent &s;i|tuation,"</P>
<P>"Want of nouri&s;hment and re&s;t!" repeated Sir Charles: "Good Heavens!" continued he, in the &s;ud|den agony of his &s;oul, (and walking from the couch) "is it po&s;&s;ible that Amanda was a wanderer in the &s;treets, without food, or a place to lay her head in?&mdash;Oh! this is dreadful!&mdash;Oh! my friends," he proceeded, looking around him, whil&s;t his eyes beamed the divine compa&s;&s;ion of his &s;oul, "be kind, be careful of this poor creature; but it is unnece&s;&s;ary to exhort you to this, and excu&s;e me for having done &s;o. Yes, I know you will delight in binding up a broken heart, and drying the tears of a wretched outca&s;t. A &s;hort time ago, and &s;he appeared"&mdash;he &s;topped, overcome by his emotions, and turned away his head to wipe away his tears; "a &s;hort time ago," he re&s;umed, "and &s;he appeared all that the heart of man could de&s;ire, all that a woman &s;hould wi&s;h and ought to be. Now &s;he is fallen indeed, lo&s;t to her&s;elf and to the world."</P>
<P>"No," cried Emily, with generous warmth, &s;tarting from the &s;ide of the couch at which &s;he had been kneel|ing, "I am confident &s;he never was guilty of an er|ror."</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="038416_0655_1011E73E043A0BE8">
"I am inclined, indeed, to be of Emily's opinion," &s;aid Mrs. Ru&s;hbrook. "I think the mon&s;ter, who &s;pread &s;uch a &s;nare for her di&s;truction, traduced Mi&s;s Donald, in order to drive her from tho&s;e who would pro|tect her from his &s;chemes."</P>
<P>"Would to Heaven the truth of your conjectures could be proved," exclaimed Sir Charles. Again he ap|proached the couch; Amanda remained in the &s;ame at|titude, but &s;eeing her eyes open, he took her cold hand, and, in a &s;oothing voice, a&s;&s;ured her &s;he was &s;afe; but the a&s;&s;urance had no effect on her; her's like the dull cold ear of death, was in&s;en&s;ible of &s;ound, a faint &s;park of life &s;eemed only quivering through her woe worn frame. "She is gone!" cried Sir Charles, pre&s;&s;ing her hand between his; "&s;he is gone, indeed! Oh, &s;weet Amanda! the mortal bounds that enclo&s;e thy afflicted &s;pirit will &s;oon be broken."</P>
<P>"I tru&s;t not, Sir," exclaimed Capt. Ru&s;hbrook; his wife and daughter were unable to &s;peak. "In my opinion &s;he had better be removed to bed."</P>
<P>Amanda was accordingly carried to a chamber, and Sir Charles remained in the drawing room till Mrs. Ru&s;hbrook had returned to it. She informed him Mi&s;s Donald continued in the &s;ame &s;tate. He de&s;ired a phy|&s;ician might be &s;ent for, and departed in inexpre&s;&s;ible dejection.</P>

<P>WE &s;hall now account for the incidents in the la&s;t Chapter. Amanda's letter to the Ru&s;hbrooks filled them with &s;urpri&s;e and con&s;ternation. Mrs. Ru&s;h|brook directly repaired to Mrs. Connel, who without he|&s;itation,
<PB N="85" REF="038416_0656_1011E7411A9701C0">
gave it as her opinion, that the whole was a fa|brication, invented by malice to ruin Sipthorpe in their opinion, or el&s;e by envy to prevent their enjoying the good fortune which he offered to their acceptance.&mdash;Mrs. Ru&s;hbrook was inclined to be of the &s;ame opinion; her mind was &s;en&s;ibly affected by the favours Sipthorpe had conferred on her family, and yielding to its grati|tude, &s;he re&s;olved to be guided implicitly by her friend, who advi&s;ed her to &s;hew the letter to him. She con&s;ider|ed this the be&s;t mea&s;ure &s;he could pur&s;ue; if innocent, he would be plea&s;ed by the confidence repo&s;ed in his ho|nour; if guilty, his confu&s;ion mu&s;t betray him; but Belgrave was guarded again&s;t detection; his &s;ervant had &s;een Amanda as &s;he was alighting from the coach the evening &s;he arrived in town. He inquired from the maid concerning her, and learned that &s;he was to lodge in the hou&s;e, and go by her a&s;&s;umed name. The&s;e cir|cum&s;tances he related to his ma&s;ter the moment he re|turned home, who was tran&s;ported at the intelligence; from her change of name he &s;uppo&s;ed her not only in deep di&s;tre&s;s, but removed from the protection of her friends, and he determined not to loo&s;e &s;o favourable an opportunity as the pre&s;ent for &s;ecuring her in his power. He in&s;tantly re&s;olved to relinqui&s;h his de&s;igns on Emily; de&s;igns which her beautiful &s;implicity and de&s;titute con|dition had &s;ugge&s;ted, and to turn all his thoughts on Amanda, who had ever been the fir&s;t object of his wi&s;h|es. His pride, as well as love, was intere&s;ted in again en&s;naring her, as he had been mortified by her &s;o &s;ucce&s;s|fully baffling all his &s;tratagems; he knew not of the manner &s;he had left his hou&s;e. Half di&s;tracted at what he &s;uppo&s;ed her e&s;cape from it, he had followed her to Ireland, and re|mained incognito near the Convent till the appearance of Mortimer convinced him any &s;chemes he formed again&s;t her mu&s;t prove abortive; but to concert a plan about &s;ecuring her required &s;ome deliberations, ere he could devi&s;e one, he was &s;ummoned to Mrs. Connel's parlour to peru&s;e the letter, and from the hand, as well as pur|port, in&s;tantly knew Amanda to be its author. With
<PB N="86" REF="038416_0657_1011E7454B5C14C0">
the daring effrontery of vice, he directly declared &s;he was a di&s;carded mi&s;tre&s;s of his, who from jealou&s;y had taken this &s;tep to prevent, if po&s;&s;ible, his union. He a&s;&s;ured them her real name was not Donald, bid them tax her with that deceit, and judge from her confu&s;ion whether &s;he was not guilty of that, as well as every thing el&s;e, he alledged again&s;t her. His unembarra&s;s|ed manner had the appearance of innocence to his too credulous auditors, prejudiced as they were already in his favour, and in their minds he was now fully acquitted of his imputed crimes. He was now carele&s;s whether Amanda &s;aw him or not (for he had before &s;tolen into the hou&s;e) being well convinced, nothing &s;he could al|ledge again&s;t him would be credited. When night ap|proached without bringing her, he grew alarmed, left he had lo&s;t her again. At la&s;t her return relieved him from this fear. The conver&s;ation which pa&s;&s;ed in the parlour he heard through means of his &s;ervant, who had li&s;tened to it. The mention of Amanda's removal in the morning made him immediately con&s;ult this &s;ervant about mea&s;ures for &s;ecuring her, and he, with the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of the maid, contrived the &s;cheme which has been already related, having forged the letter in Emily's name. But how inadequate is language to de&s;cribe the rage that took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his &s;oul, when going at the appointed hour to carry Amanda off, he found her already gone. He raved, cur&s;ed, &s;tamped, and accu&s;ed the woman and his &s;ervant of being privy to her e&s;cape. In vain Mrs. Deborah told him of the trick &s;he had played on her, and how &s;he had been obliged to get into the hou&s;e through the window. He continued his accu&s;ations, which &s;o provoked his &s;ervant, con&s;cious of their unju&s;tne&s;s, that he at la&s;t replied to them with in&s;olence.&mdash;This, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Belgrave's mind, was not to be borne, and he immediately &s;truck him over the forehead with his &s;word, and with a violence which felled him to the earth. Scarcely had he obey|ed ere he repented this impul&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion, which &s;eemed attended with fatal con&s;equences, for the man gave no &s;ymptoms of exi&s;tence. Con&s;ideration for his own &s;afe|ty
<PB N="87" REF="038416_0658_1011E746D9CCCC20">
was more prevalent in his mind than any feeling of humanity, and he in&s;tantly ru&s;hed from the hou&s;e, ere the woman was &s;ufficiently recovered from her horror and amazement, to be able to call to the other &s;ervants, as &s;he afterwards did, to &s;top him. He fled to town, and ha&s;tened to an hotel in Pall Mall, from whence he determined to hire a carriage for Dover, and thence em|bark for the Continent. A&s;cending the &s;tairs he met a man of all others he would have wi&s;hed to avoid, name|ly, Sir Charles Bingley. He &s;tarted, but it was too late to retreat. He then endeavoured to &s;hake off his em|barra&s;&s;ment, from a faint hope that Sir Charles had not heard of his villainous de&s;ign upon Mi&s;s Ru&s;hbrook; but this hope vani&s;hed the moment Sir Charles addre&s;&s;ed him who with coldne&s;s and contempt, &s;aid, "he would be glad to &s;peak to him for a few minutes;" but ere we relate their conver&s;ation it is nece&s;&s;ary to relate a few particulars of the Ru&s;hbrooks.</P>
<P>Captain Ru&s;hbrook, from knowing more of the deceits of mankind than his wife, was le&s;s credulous! the more he reflected on the letter, the more he felt doubts ob|truding on his mind, and he re&s;olved &s;ooner to forfeit the friend&s;hip of Sipthorpe than permit any farther inter|cour&s;e between him and his daughter, till tho&s;e doubts were removed. He &s;ent his &s;on to Sir Charles's agent, and had the &s;atisfaction of hearing he was then in town, and lodged at an hotel in Pall Mall. He immediately wrote to Sir Charles, and reque&s;ted to &s;ee him whenever he was at lei&s;ure, adding, he was well convinced his be|nevolence would excu&s;e the liberty he had taken, when informed of the purpo&s;e for which his vi&s;it was reque&s;t|ed. Sir Charles was fortunately within, and directly at|tended little Ru&s;hbrook to the pri&s;on. The letter had filled him with &s;urpri&s;e, but that &s;urpri&s;e gave way the moment he entered the wretched apartment of Ru&s;h|brook, to the powerful emotions of pity; a &s;cene more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing he had never &s;een, or could not have con|ceived. He &s;aw the emaciated form of the &s;oldier, for &s;uch his dre&s;s announced him, &s;eated be&s;ide a dying fire, his little children &s;urrounding him, who&s;e faded counte|nances
<PB N="88" REF="038416_0659_1011E748686961F8">
denoted their keen participation of his grief, and the &s;ad partner of his mi&s;ery bending her eyes upon tho&s;e children with mingled love and &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook was unable to &s;peak for a few minutes after his entrance. When he recovered his voice, he thank|ed him for the kind attention he had paid his reque&s;t, briefly informed him of the motives for that reque&s;t, and ended by putting Amanda's letter into his hand. Sir Charles peru&s;ed it with horror and amazement: "Gra|cious Heaven!" he exclaimed, "what a mon&s;ter! I know not the lady who has referred you to me, but I can te&s;tify the truth of her allegations. I am &s;hocked to think &s;uch a mon&s;ter as Belgrave exi&s;ts.</P>
<P>Shocked at the idea of the de&s;truction &s;he was &s;o near devoting her daughter to, di&s;appointed in the hopes &s;he entertained of having her family liberated from pri&s;on, and &s;truck with remor&s;e for her conduct to Amanda, Mrs Ru&s;hbrook fell <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ainting to the floor, overpowered by her painful emotions; Sir Charles aided in rai&s;ing her from it, for the trembling hand of Ru&s;hbrook refu&s;ed its a&s;&s;i&s;tance. "Unhappy woman!" he exclaimed, "the di&s;appointment of her hopes is too much for her feeble frame." Water, the only re&s;torative in the room, being &s;prinkled in her face, &s;he &s;lowly revived, and the fir&s;t object &s;he beheld was the pale and weeping Emily, whom her father had in&s;i&s;ted on being brought to the pri&s;on. "Oh my child," &s;he cried, cla&s;ping her to her bo&s;om, "can you forgive the mother who was &s;o near devoting you to de&s;truction? Oh! my children for your &s;ake, how near was I &s;acrificing this dear, this precious girl! I blu&s;h, I &s;hudder, when I reflect on my conduct to the unhappy young creature, who, like her guardian angel; interpo&s;ed between my child and ruin; but the&s;e dreary walls," &s;he continued, bur&s;ting into an agony of tears, "which now we mu&s;t never hope to pa&s;s, will hide my &s;hame and &s;orrows together!"</P>
<P>"Do not de&s;pair, my dear Madam," &s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ir Charles, in the &s;oft accent of benevolence, "nor do you," con|tinued he, turning to Ru&s;hbrook, "deem me imperti|nent in inquiring into tho&s;e &s;orrows." His accent, his
<PB N="89" REF="038416_0660_1011E74C5C3C16A0">
manner, were &s;o &s;oothing, that the&s;e children of mi&s;e|ry, who had long been &s;trangers to the voice of kind|ne&s;s, gave him, with tears and &s;ighs, a &s;hort relation of their &s;orrows. He heard them with deep attention, and when he departed gave them &s;uch a &s;mile, as we may &s;uppo&s;e would beam from an angel, if &s;ent by Heaven to pour the balm of comfort and mercy over the &s;orrows of a bur&s;ting heart.</P>
<P>He returned early in the morning: how bright, how animated was his countenance! O ye &s;ons of riot and extravagance! ye children of di&s;&s;ipation! never did ye experience a plea&s;ure equal to his, when he entered the apartment of Ru&s;hbrook to inform him he was free; when in the impa&s;&s;ioned&punc; yet faltering accents of &s;en&s;ibi|lity, he communicated the joyful tidings, and heard the little children repeat his words, while their parents gazed on each other with &s;urpri&s;e and rapture.</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook at length attempted to pour out the ful|ne&s;s of his heart, but Sir Charles &s;topped him. "Ble&s;|&s;ed with a fortune," cried he, "beyond my wants, to what nobler purpo&s;e could &s;uperfluous wealth be devo|ted, than to the enlargement of a man who has &s;erved his country, and who has a family, which he may bring up to act as he has done. May the re&s;toration of liber|ty be productive of every happine&s;s! Your pri&s;on gates, I rejoice to repeat it, are open; may the friend&s;hip which commenced within the&s;e walls be la&s;ting as our lives!" To dwell longer on this &s;ubject is unnece&s;&s;ary. The tran&s;ported family were conveyed to Mrs. Connel's where he had been the preceding night to order every thing for their reception. He then had enquired about Sipthorpe, or rather Belgrave, whom he meant to upbraid for his cruel de&s;igns again&s;t Mi&s;s Ru&s;hbrook; but Bel|grave, as &s;oon as his plan was &s;ettled about Amanda, had quitted Mrs. Connel's. The joy of the Ru&s;hbrooks was greatly damped the next morning on hearing of the &s;e|cret departure of Amanda. What Belgrave had &s;aid again&s;t her they never would have credited, but for the appearance of my&s;tery which enveloped her, &s;till her amiable attention to them merited their true&s;t gratitude,
<PB N="90" REF="038416_0661_1011E75050E6C070">
they wi&s;hed to have expre&s;&s;ed that gratitude to her, and offer her their &s;ervices. Much as appearances were again&s;t Amanda, yet from the very moment Mrs. Ru&s;hbrook declared it her idea that Belgrave had traduced her for the purpo&s;e of depriving her of protection, a &s;imilar idea &s;tarted in Sir Charles's mind, and he re&s;olved to &s;eek Belgrave, and never re&s;t till he had di&s;covered whether there was any truth in his a&s;&s;ertions again&s;t Amanda. Their meeting at the hotel was con&s;idered as fortunate as unexpected by him; yet could he not di&s;gui&s;e for a moment the contempt his character in&s;pired him with. He reproached hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> as &s;oon as they entered an apartment for his ba&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> again&s;t Mi&s;s Ru&s;hbrook, de&s;igns in every re&s;pect d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ing to his character, &s;ince he knew the blow he levelled at the peace of her father could not from the unfortunate &s;ituation of that father, be re&s;ent|ed." "You are," continued Sir Charles, "not only the violator, but the defamer of female innocence; I am well convinced, from reflection on pa&s;t and pre&s;ent circum|&s;tances, that your allegations agai&s;t Mi&s;s Fitzalan were as fal&s;e as vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">."</P>
<P>"You may doubt them, Sir Chares," replied Bel|grave, "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it is agreeable to you; but yet, as a friend, I advi&s;e you not to let every one know you are her champion."</P>
<P>"Oh, Belgrave!" cried Sir Charles, "can you think without remor&s;e of having de&s;troyed not only the repu|tation, but the exi&s;tence of an amible young creature."</P>
<P>"The exi&s;tence! repeated Belgrave, &s;tarting, and with a kind of horror in his look, "what do you mean?"</P>
<P>"I mean that Amanda Fitzalan, involved through your means in a variety of wretchedne&s;s &s;he was unable to &s;upport, is now on her death bed!&mdash;Belgrave chang|ed colour, trembled, and in an agitated voice demanded an explanation of Sir Charles's words.</P>
<P>Sir Charles &s;aw his feelings were touched, and tru&s;ting they would produce the di&s;covery he wi&s;hed, briefly gave him the particulars he a&s;ked for.</P>
<P>Amanda was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he only woman that had ever really touched the heart of Belgrave. His mind filled with
<PB N="91" REF="038416_0662_1011E751E2A79500">
horror, and enervated with fear, at the idea of the crime he had recently committed, could make no oppo&s;ition to the grief he experienced on hearing of her &s;ituation, a grief heightened almo&s;t to di&s;traction, by reflecting that he was acce&s;&s;ary to it. "Dying!" he repeated, "A|manda Fitzalan dying! but &s;he will be happy; her's will be a pure and mini&s;tering &s;pirit in Heaven, while mine lies howling; the angels are not purer in mind and per&s;on than &s;he is!"</P>
<P>"Then you are an execrable villain!" exclaimed Sir Charles, laying his hand on his &s;word.</P>
<P>"Strike!" exclaimed Belgrave, with an air of wild|ne&s;s; "death will rid me of horrors; death from you will be better than the ignominious one which now &s;tares me in the face; for I have&mdash;oh! horrible&mdash;this night I have committed murder!"</P>
<P>A&s;toni&s;hed and di&s;mayed, Sir Charles gazed on him with earne&s;tne&s;s.</P>
<P>"It is true!" continued he, in the &s;ame wild manner, "it is true! therefore &s;trike! but again&s;t you I will not rai&s;e my hand; it were impious to touch a life like your's, con&s;ecrated to the purpo&s;es of virtue: no, I would not deprive the wretched of their friend."</P>
<P>Sir Charles, &s;till &s;huddering at his words, demanded an explanation of them; and the tortured &s;oul of Belgrave, as if happy to meet any one it could confide in, after a little he&s;itation, divulged at once its crimes and horrors. "No," cried Sir Charles, when he had concluded, "to rai&s;e a hand again&s;t him over whom the arm of ju&s;tice is uplifted, were cruel, as well as cowardly; go then, and may repentance, not puni&s;hment overtake you." To de|&s;cribe the raptures Sir Charles experienced at the acquit|tal of Amanda is impo&s;&s;ible; not a fond father rejoicing over the re&s;tored fame of a darling child could experience more exqui&s;ite delight. The next morning, as &s;oon as he thought it po&s;&s;ible<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&mdash;could gain admittance, he ha&s;|tened to Mrs. Connel's, and had the &s;atisfaction of hear|ing from Mrs. Ru&s;hbrook that Amanda was then in a &s;weet &s;leep, from which the mo&s;t &s;alutary con&s;equences might be expected. With almo&s;t trembling impatience,
<PB N="92" REF="038416_0663_1011E75490A24148">
he communicated the tran&s;ports of his heart, and his auditors rejoiced as much at the&s;e tran&s;ports on Aman|da's account as on his. Mrs. Ru&s;hbrook and Emily had &s;at up with her the preceding night, which &s;he pa&s;|&s;ed in a mo&s;t re&s;tle&s;s manner without any perception of &s;urrounding objects. Towards morning &s;he fell into a profound &s;leep, which they tru&s;ted would recruit her exhau&s;ted frame. Mrs. Ru&s;hbrook then withdrew to her hu&s;band. It was pa&s;t noon ere Amanda awoke. At fir&s;t a plea&s;ing langour was diffu&s;ed through her frame, which prevented her from having an idea of her &s;ituati|on; but gradually her recollection returned, and with it anxiety to know where &s;he was. She remembered to the moment &s;he had met Sir Charles, but no farther. She gently opened the curtain, and beheld, oh! how great the plea&s;ure of that moment, Emily &s;itting by the bed-&s;ide, who in&s;tantly ri&s;ing, ki&s;&s;ed her cheek in a tran&s;port of affection, and inquired how &s;he did? Oh! how delightful, how &s;oothing was that gentle voice to the ears of Amanda! the &s;ofte&s;t mu&s;ic could not have been more grateful, her heart vibrated to it with an exqui&s;ite degree of plea&s;ure, and her eyes fea&s;ted on the rays of benevolence which &s;treamed from tho&s;e of Emi|ly's.&mdash;At la&s;t in a faint voice, &s;he &s;aid, "I am &s;ure I am &s;afe, &s;ince I am with Emily."</P>
<P>Mrs. Ru&s;hbrook entered at that in&s;tant; her delight at the re&s;tored faculties of Amanda was equal to her daughter's, yet the recollection of her own conduct made her almo&s;t reluctant to approach her. At la&s;t advan|cing, "I blu&s;h, yet I rejoice, oh! how truly rejoice, to behold you," &s;he exclaimed; "that I could be tempted to harbour a doubt again&s;t you fills me with re|gret, and the vindication of your innocence can &s;carce|ly yield you more plea&s;ure than it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ields me."</P>
<P>"The vindication of my innocence!" repeated A|manda, rai&s;ing her head from the pillow: "Oh, graci|ous, Heaven! is it then vindicated! Tell me, I conjure you, how&punc; and by what means."</P>
<P>Mrs. Ru&s;hbrook ha&s;tened to obey her, and related all &s;he had heard from Sir Charles; the re&s;toration of
<PB N="93" REF="038416_0664_1011E7561E5818D0">
her fame &s;eemed to re-animate the &s;oul of Amanda, yet tears bur&s;t from her and &s;he trembled with emotion. Mrs. Ru&s;hbrook was alarmed, and endeavoured to com|po&s;e her.</P>
<P>"Do not be unea&s;y," &s;aid Amanda, "tho&s;e tears will never injure me; it is long&mdash;it is very long, &s;ince I have &s;hed tears of joy!" She implored Heaven's choice&s;t ble&s;&s;ings on Sir Charles for his genero&s;ity to her, his be|nevolence to the Ru&s;hbrooks. Her heart relieved of a heavy burthen of anxiety on her account, now grew more anxious than ever to learn &s;omething of her poor O&s;car, and, notwith&s;tanding Mrs. Ru&s;hbrook's entreaties to the contrary, who feared &s;he was exerting her&s;elf beyond her &s;trength, &s;he aro&s;e in the afternoon, for the purpo&s;e of going to the drawing-room, determined, as Sir Charles's generous conduct merited her confidence, to relate to him as well as Mr. Ru&s;hbrook, the motives which had brought her to town, the particulars of her life nece&s;&s;ary to be known, and to reque&s;t their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in trying to learn intelligence of her brother; Emily helped her to dre&s;s, and &s;upported her to the drawing-room. Sir Charles had continued in the hou&s;e the whole day, and met her as &s;he entered with mingled love and pity, for in her feeble form, her faded cheek, he wit|ne&s;&s;ed the ravages of grief and &s;ickne&s;s; his eyes more than his tongue expre&s;&s;ed his feelings, yet, in the &s;ofte&s;t accent of tenderne&s;s did he pour forth tho&s;e feelings, whil&s;t his hand trembled as it pre&s;&s;ed her's to his bo&s;om.</P>
<P>"My feelings, Sir Charles," &s;aid &s;he, cannot be ex|pre&s;&s;ed; but my gratitude to you will cea&s;e but with my exi&s;tence."</P>
<P>Sir Charles be&s;ought her to be &s;ilent on &s;uch a &s;ub|ject. "He was &s;elfi&s;h," he &s;aid, "in every thing he did for her, for on her happine&s;s his depended."</P>
<P>Ru&s;hbrook approached to offer his congratulations. He &s;poke of her kindne&s;s, but, like Sir Charles, the &s;ubject was painful to her, and dropped at her reque&s;t. The idea of being &s;afe, the &s;oothing attentions &s;he ex|perienced, gave to her mind a tranquillity it had long
<PB N="94" REF="038416_0665_1011E75B17228410">
been a &s;tranger to, and &s;he looked back on her pa&s;t dan|gers but to enjoy more truly her pre&s;ent &s;ecurity; as &s;he witne&s;&s;ed the happine&s;s of the Ru&s;hbrooks, &s;he could &s;carcely forbear applauding aloud the author of that hap|pine&s;s; but &s;he judged of his heart by her own, and therefore checked her&s;elf by believing he would prefer the &s;ilent plaudits of that heart to any prai&s;e what&s;oever. After tea, when only Sir Charles, Mr. and Mrs. Ru&s;h|brook, and Emily, were pre&s;ent, &s;he entered upon the affairs &s;he wi&s;hed to communicate. They heard her with deep attention, wonder and pity, and when &s;he con|cluded, both Sir Charles and Ru&s;hbrook declared their readine&s;s to &s;erve her. The latter, who had betrayed &s;trong emotions during her narrative, a&s;&s;ured her, "he doubted not, nay, he was almo&s;t convinced, he &s;hould &s;oon be able to procure her intelligence of her brother."</P>
<P>This was a &s;weet a&s;&s;urance to the heart of Amanda, and cheered by it &s;he &s;oon retired to bed. Her &s;trength being exhau&s;ted by &s;peaking, &s;he &s;unk into a tranquil &s;lumber, and next morning &s;he aro&s;e for breakfa&s;t.&mdash;"Well," &s;aid Ru&s;hbrook to her, as they &s;at at it, "I told you la&s;t night I &s;hould &s;oon be able to procure you intelligence of your brother, and I was not mi&s;taken."</P>
<P>"Oh, Heavens!" cried Amanda, in trembling emo|tion, "have you really heard any thing of him?"</P>
<P>"Be compo&s;ed, my dear girl," &s;aid he, taking her hand in the mo&s;t &s;oothing, mo&s;t affectionate manner, "I have heard of him, but&mdash;"</P>
<P>"But what?" interrupted Amanda, with increa&s;ed emotion.</P>
<P>"Why, that he has experienced &s;ome of the trials of life; but let the reflection that tho&s;e trials are over, pre|vent your &s;uffering pain by hearing of them."</P>
<P>"Oh! tell me, I entreat," &s;aid Amanda, "where he is. Tell me, I conjure you, &s;hall I &s;ee him?"</P>
<P>"Yes," replied Ru&s;hbrook, "you &s;hall &s;ee him; to keep you no longer in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, in that dreary pri&s;on from which I have been ju&s;t relea&s;ed, he has langui&s;hed for many months."</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="038416_0666_1011E75DE11CDA38">
"Oh! my brother," exclaimed Amanda, while tears gu&s;hed from her.</P>
<P>"I knew not," continued Ru&s;hbrook, "from the concealment of your name, that he was your brother till la&s;t night. I then told Sir Charles, and he is gone this morning to him; but you mu&s;t expect to &s;ee him &s;ome|what altered. The re&s;toration of liberty, and the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of fortune, will no doubt &s;oon re-e&s;tabli&s;h his health. Hark! I think I hear a voice on the &s;tairs."</P>
<P>Amanda &s;tarted, aro&s;e, attempted to move, but &s;unk again upon her chair. The door opened, and Sir Charles entered, followed by&mdash;O&s;car. Though prepared for an alteration in his looks, &s;he was not by any means prepar|ed for the alteration which &s;truck her the moment &s;he beheld him; pale and thin even to a degree of emacia|tion; he was dre&s;&s;ed or rather wrapped, in an old regi|mental great coat, his fine hair wildly di&s;hevelled. As he approached her, Amanda aro&s;e.</P>
<P>"Amanda, my &s;i&s;ter!" &s;aid he in a faint voice. She tottered forward, and falling upon his bo&s;om, gave way in tears to the mingled joy and angui&s;h of the moment. O&s;car pre&s;&s;ed her to his heart. He gazed one her with the fonde&s;t rapture; yet a rapture &s;uddenly checked, by &s;urveying the alteration in her appearance, which was as &s;triking to him as h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s was to her. Her pale and woe|wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n countenance, her &s;able dre&s;s, at once declared her &s;ufferings, and brought mo&s;t painfully to recollection the irreparable lo&s;s they had &s;u&s;tained &s;ince their la&s;t meeting.</P>
<P>"Oh, my father!" groaned O&s;car, unable to controul the &s;trong emotions of his mind&mdash;"Oh, my father! when la&s;t we met we were ble&s;&s;ed with your pre&s;ence." He cla&s;ped Amanda clo&s;er to his heart as he &s;poke, as if doubly endeared to her by her de&s;olate &s;ituation.</P>
<P>"To avoid regretting him is indeed impo&s;&s;ible," &s;aid Amanda; "yet had he lived, what tortures would have wrung his heart in witne&s;&s;ing the unhappine&s;s of his children, when he had not the power of removing it."</P>
<P>"Come," cried captain Ru&s;hbrook, who&s;e eyes, like tho&s;e of every per&s;on pre&s;ent, confe&s;&s;ed his &s;ympathetic

feelings, "let us not cloud pre&s;ent ble&s;&s;ings by the re|tro&s;pect of pa&s;t misfortunes. In this life we mu&s;t all expect to meet with &s;uch lo&s;&s;es as you lament. As &s;oon as O&s;car and Amanda grew compo&s;ed they were left to them&s;elves, and O&s;car then &s;atisfied the anxious and impatient heart of his &s;i&s;ter, by informing her of all that had befallen him. He began with his attachment for Adela, and the di&s;appointment of that attachment; but as this part of the &s;tory is already known, we &s;hall pa&s;s it over in &s;ilence, and merely relate the occa&s;ion of his quarrel with Belgrave.</P>

<P>I LEFT Enni&s;killen, &s;aid O&s;car, in the ut|mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s of mind, for I left it with the idea, that I might no more behold Adela: yet dear and precious as her &s;ight was to my &s;oul, I rejoiced &s;he had not accom|panied the regiment, &s;ince to have beheld her but as the wife of Belgrave, would have been in&s;upportable, had the di&s;appointment of my pa&s;&s;ion been occa&s;ioned by its not meeting a return, pride would have a&s;&s;i&s;ted me to conquer it: but to know it was tenderly returned, at once cheri&s;hed, and, if po&s;&s;ible, increa&s;ed it. The idea of the happine&s;s I might have attained, rendered me in|&s;en&s;ible of any I might &s;till have enjoyed. I perform|ed
<PB N="97" REF="038416_0668_1011E760FAB2B3F0">
the duties of my &s;ituation mechanically, and &s;hun|ned &s;ociety as much as po&s;&s;ible, unable to bear the rail|lery of my gay companions on my melancholy.</P>
<P>The &s;ummer you came to Ireland, the regiment re|moved to Bray, who&s;e romantic &s;ituation allowed me to enjoy many delightful and &s;olitary rambles. It was there a man enli&s;ted, who&s;e manner and appearance were, for many days, &s;ubjects of &s;urpri&s;e and conver&s;ation to us all: from both it was obvious, he had been accu&s;tomed to one of the &s;uperior &s;ituations in life. A form more &s;trikingly elegant I never beheld: the officers made ma|ny attempts to try and di&s;cover who he really was, but he evaded all their enquiries, yet with the utmo&s;t agita|tion. What rendered him, if po&s;&s;ible, more intere&s;t|ing, was his being accompanied by a young and lovely woman, who like him, appeared &s;unk beneath her ori|ginal &s;tate: but to their pre&s;ent one both conformed, if not with cheerfulne&s;s, at lea&s;t with re&s;ignation.</P>
<P>Mary obtained work from almo&s;t all the officers. Henry was diligent in his duties, and both were univer|&s;ally admired and re&s;pected. Often in my lonely rambles have I &s;urpri&s;ed this unfortunate pair, who, it was evi|dent, like me &s;ough<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> for the indulgence of &s;or|row; weeping <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> if o'er the remembrance of happier hours. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> I beheld them gazing, with mingled agony and tenderne&s;s, on the infant which Ma|ry nur&s;ed, as if &s;huddering at the idea of its de&s;tiny.</P>
<P>The loveline&s;s of Mary was too &s;triking not to attract the notice of Belgrave, and from her &s;ituation he flat|tered him&s;elf &s;he would be an ea&s;y prey; he was, how|ever, mi&s;taken; &s;he repul&s;ed his overtures with equal abhorrence and indignation. She wi&s;hed to conceal them from her hu&s;band, but he heard of them through the means of his fellow &s;oldiers, who had &s;everal times &s;een the Colonel following his wife. It was then he really felt the bitterne&s;s of a &s;ervile &s;ituation. Of his wife he had no doubt; &s;he had already given him a con|vincing proof of con&s;tancy, but he dreaded the in&s;ults &s;he might receive from the Colonel. The united vigi|lance
<PB N="98" REF="038416_0669_1011E7639C4ABCA0">
of both prevented, however, for &s;ome time, a re|petition of tho&s;e in&s;ults. Exa&s;perated by their vigi|lance, the Colonel at la&s;t concerted one of the mo&s;t dia|bolical plans which could have entered into the heart of man. A party of the &s;oldiers were ordered to the &s;ea|&s;ide, to watch there for &s;muggled goods; Henry was named to be of the party, but when the &s;oldiers were drawn out, he was not to be found. Belgrave's &s;ervant the vile agent of his ma&s;ter, had informed him that the Colonel meant to take advantage of his ab&s;ence, and vi|&s;it his wife. He, trembling for her &s;afety, re&s;olved to run every ri&s;k, &s;ooner than leave her unguarded, and accordingly ab&s;conded till the departure of the party. The con&s;equence of this was, that on his re-appearance he was put under an arre&s;t for di&s;obedience of orders, tried the next day, and &s;entenced to be flogged on the following one. The very officers that pa&s;&s;ed the &s;en|tence regretted it: but the &s;trictne&s;s of military di&s;ci|pline rendered it unavoidable.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not attempt to de&s;cribe the &s;ituation of the un|happy young couple; they felt for each other more than for them&s;elves, and pride heightened the agonies of Henry.</P>
<P>Pale, weeping, with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> air, Mary flew to my apartment, and &s;inking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> feet, with uplifted hands be&s;ought me to interpo&s;e in favour of her hu&s;|band. I rai&s;ed the poor mourner from the ground, and a&s;&s;ured her, yet with a &s;igh, from the fear of proving un&s;ucce&s;sful, that I would do all in my power to &s;ave him. I therefore ha&s;tened to the Colonel to a&s;k for another that favour I &s;hould have di&s;dained to de&s;ire for my&s;elf. But to &s;erve this wretched couple, I felt I could almo&s;t humble my&s;elf to the earth.</P>
<P>The Colonel was on the parade; and, as if aware of my intention, appeared &s;edulous to avoid me. But I would not be repul&s;ed by this, and following him, en|treated his attention for a few minutes.</P>
<P>"Di&s;patch your bu&s;ine&s;s then in ha&s;te, Sir," &s;aid he, with an unu&s;ual haughtine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="038416_0670_1011E76859983F00">
"I &s;hall, Sir," cried I, endeavouring to repre&s;s the indignation his manner excited," and I al&s;o hope with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>"What is your bu&s;ine&s;s, Sir?" demanded he.</P>
<P>"'Tis the bu&s;ine&s;s of humanity," I replied, "and 'tis only for others I could a&s;k a favour."</P>
<P>I then proceeded to mention it. Rage and malice in|flamed his countenance as I &s;poke.</P>
<P>"Never," exclaimed he, "&s;hall the wretch receive pardon from me; and I am a&s;toni&s;hed at your pre&s;ump|tion in a&s;king it."</P>
<P>"Yet not half &s;o a&s;toni&s;hed," replied I, as I am at your obduracy:&mdash;though why do I &s;ay &s;o? from your pa&s;t actions, I &s;hould not be &s;urpri&s;ed at any you may now commit.</P>
<P>His pa&s;&s;ion grew almo&s;t to frenzy; he a&s;ked me "if I knew who I was addre&s;&s;ing?"</P>
<P>"Too well," I replied, "I know I am addre&s;&s;ing one of the complete&s;t villains upon earth."</P>
<P>He rai&s;ed a &s;mall rattan he held at the&s;e words, in a threatening manner. I could no longer oppo&s;e my indig|nation; I ru&s;hed upon him, wre&s;ted it from his hand, broke it, and flung it over his head.</P>
<P>"Now," cried I, laying my hand upon my &s;word, "I am ready to give you the &s;atisfaction you may de|&s;ire for my words&mdash;words, who&s;e truth I will uphold with my life."</P>
<P>"No," &s;aid he, with the coolne&s;s of deliberate ma|lice, "'tis a far different &s;atisfaction I &s;hall expect to receive."</P>
<P>Some of the officers had by this time gathered round us, and attempted to interfere; but he commanded their &s;ilence in a haughty manner, and ordered me under an immediate arre&s;t.</P>
<P>My fate I then knew decided, but I re&s;olved to bear that fate with fortitude, not let him, triumph in every re|&s;pect ever me. I was confined to my room, and Henry the next morning was brought forth to receive his puni&s;h|ment. I will not, my &s;i&s;ter, pain your gentle heart, by de&s;cribing to you, as it was de&s;cribed to me by an officer

his parting from his wife; prid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, indignation, tenderne&s;s and pity, were &s;truggling in h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> heart, and vi&s;ible in his countenance. He attempted to a&s;&s;ume compo&s;ure; but when he reached the de&s;tined &s;pot, he could no longer controul his feelings; the idea of being expo&s;ed, di&s;gra|ced, was too much for his noble &s;oul: the palene&s;s of his face encrea&s;ed, he tottered, he fell into the arms of a &s;ol|dier and expired, groaning forth the name of Mary.</P>
<P>Four days after this melancholy event, a court-mar|tial was held on me, when, as I expected, I was broken, for contempt to my &s;uperior officer. I retired to a little &s;olitary inn near Bray, in a &s;tate of mind which baffles de&s;cription, de&s;titute of friends or fortune. I felt at that moment, as if I had no bu&s;ine&s;s in the world.</P>
<P>I was followed to the inn by a young Lieutenant, with whom I had been on an intimate footing. The grief he expre&s;&s;ed at my &s;ituation rou&s;ed me from al|mo&s;t a &s;tupefaction that was &s;tealing on me. The voice of friend&s;hip will penetrate the deepe&s;t gloom, and I felt my &s;orrows gradually allayed by it. He a&s;ked me "had I fixed on any plan for my&s;elf?" I replied "I had not, for it was vain to fix on plans when there were no friends to &s;upport them." He took my hand, and told me "I was mi&s;taken; in a few days he tru&s;ted to procure me letters to a gentleman in London, who had con&s;iderable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the We&s;t Indies, if &s;uch a thing was agreeable to me." It was ju&s;t what I wi&s;hed for, and I thanked him with the &s;incere&s;t gratitude.</P>
<P>In the evening I received a me&s;&s;age from the unfor|tunate Mary, reque&s;ting to &s;ee me directly; the &s;oldier who brought it &s;aid &s;he was dying. I ha&s;tened to her; &s;he was in bed, and &s;upported by a &s;oldier's wife. The declining &s;un-beams &s;tole into the apartment, and &s;hed a kind of &s;olemn glory around her. The beauty that had cau&s;ed her misfortunes was faded, but &s;he looked more intere&s;ting than when adorned with that bloom of beau|ty. Sighs and tears impeded her words for &s;ome mi|nutes after I approached her; at la&s;t, in a faint voice, &s;he &s;aid, "I &s;ent for you, Sir, becau&s;e I knew your good|ne&s;s, your benevolence, would excu&s;e the liberty; I

knew you would think that no trouble which could &s;ooth the la&s;t &s;ad moments of a wretched woman."</P>
<P>She then proceeded to inform me of the motives which made her &s;end, namely, to convey her infant to her father, a per&s;on of fortune in Dublin, and to &s;ee her remains, ere I did &s;o, laid by tho&s;e of her hu&s;band's. Her unfortunate Henry," &s;he added, "had been &s;on to a re&s;pectable merchant: their families were intimate, and an attachment which commenced at an early period between them, was encouraged. Henry's father expe|rienced a &s;udden rever&s;e of fortune, and her's in con&s;e|quence of it, forbid their ever thinking more of each other: but they could not obey his commands, and mar|ried clande&s;tinely, thus forfeiting the favour of all their friends, as Henry's thought he wanted &s;pirit, and her's deemed her deficient in re&s;pect to her father, they were therefore compelled, by nece&s;&s;ity, to a &s;tate of life infi|nitely beneath them; but in my grave," continued &s;he, "I tru&s;t my father will bury all his re&s;entment, and protect this little orphan."</P>
<P>I promi&s;ed a religious ob&s;ervance to her commands, and &s;he expired in about an hour after I quitted her. Mournful were the ta&s;ks &s;he enjoined me. I attended her remains to the grave, and then conveyed her child to Dublin.</P>
<P>Startled, amazed, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, her father too late re|gretted his rigor, and received her infant to his arms with floods of repentant tears.</P>
<P>I now procured my recommendatory letters, and &s;ailed for England, having fir&s;t written farewell ones to my father and Mrs. Marlowe, in which I informed both I was about quitting the kingdom. As &s;oon as I had pro|cured cheap lodings in London, I repaired to the gentle|man to whom I was recommended; but to conceive my con&s;ternation when I heard he was him&s;elf gone to the We&s;t Indies. I turned into a coffee-hou&s;e, with an in|tention of communicating this intelligence to my friend. While the waiter was getting me materials for writing, I took up a new&s;paper, and ca&s;t my eyes carele&s;sly over it. Oh! my Amanda, what was the &s;hock of that mo|ment,
<PB N="102" REF="038416_0673_1011E76C6A490ED8">
when I read my father's death: grief for him, anxiety for you, both a&s;&s;ailed my heart too powerfully for its feelings: my head grew giddy, my &s;ight failed me, and I fell back with a deep groan. When recover|ed, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome gentlemen, I reque&s;ted a carriage might be &s;ent for, but I was too weak to walk to it. On returning to my lodings I was compelled to go to bed, from which I never ro&s;e for a fortnight. Dur|ing my illne&s;s, all the little money I had brought along with me was expended, and I was, be&s;ides, con&s;ider|ably in debt with the people of the hou&s;e, for procuring me nece&s;&s;aries. When able to &s;it up, they furni&s;hed their accounts, and I candidly told my inability to di&s;charge them; in con&s;equence of this I was arre&s;ted, and &s;uffered but to take of my clothes a change or two of linen. The horrors of what I imagined would be a la&s;ting captivity, were heightened by reflecting on your unprotected &s;itua|tion. A thou&s;and times was I on the point of writing, to inquire into that &s;ituation, but &s;till checked my&s;elf by reflecting, that as I could not aid you, I &s;hould only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to any griefs you might be oppre&s;t with by acquaint|ing you of mine. The company of Captain Ru&s;hbrook alleviated in &s;ome degree the drearine&s;s of my time. I knew I &s;hould &s;u&s;tain an irreparable lo&s;s in lo&s;ing him, but I &s;hould have dete&s;ted my&s;elf if any &s;elfi&s;h motives had prevented my rejoicing at his enlargement. Oh! lit|tle did I think his liberation was leading the way to mine. Early this morning he returned and introduced Sir Charles Bingley to me. Gently, and by degrees, they broke the joyful intelligence they had to communicate; with truth I can aver, that the announcement of a &s;plen|did fortune was not &s;o plea&s;ing to my heart, as the men|tion of my &s;i&s;ter's &s;afety. Of my poor Adela, I know nothing &s;ince my confinement; but I &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">dder to think of what &s;he may have &s;uffered, from being left &s;olely in the power of &s;uch a man as Belgrave, for the good old General died &s;oon after I left Enni&s;killin."</P>
<P>"Regret not too bitterly, my dear O&s;car," &s;aid Mrs. Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lowe, in one of her letters," the good man's death, father rejoice he was removed, ere his la&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> were

embittered by the knowledge of his darling child's un|happine&s;s."</P>
<P>"Oh! my &s;i&s;ter," continued O&s;car, with a heavy &s;igh, while tears &s;ell from him and mingled with tho&s;e Aman|da <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hedding, "in this world we mu&s;t have &s;till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to wi&s;h and &s;igh for."</P>
<P>O&s;car here concluded his narrative, with &s;uch an ex|pre&s;&s;ion of melancholy, as gave to Amanda the &s;ad idea of his pa&s;&s;ion for Adela being incurable. This was in|deed the ca&s;e, neither rea&s;on, time, or ab&s;ence could re|move or le&s;&s;en it, and the acqui&s;ition of liberty or for|tune lo&s;t half their value by brooding o'er her lo&s;s.</P>
<P>When their friends returned to the drawing room, and again offered their congratulations, O&s;car's dejec|tion would not permit him to reply to them. When Mr. and Mrs. Ru&s;hbrook &s;poke of the happine&s;s he might now enjoy, he li&s;tened to their recapitulation of it as to a ful&s;ome tale, to which his heart in &s;ecret gave the lie; an innate &s;en&s;e of piety, however, recalled him to a proper recollection of the ble&s;&s;ings &s;o unexpectedly declared to be his; he accu&s;ed him&s;elf of ingratitude to heaven in yielding to murmurs, after &s;o a&s;toni&s;hing a re|ver&s;e in his &s;ituation: perfect happine&s;s he had been ear|ly taught, and daily experience confirmed the truth of the remark, was rarely to be met with; how pre&s;ump|tuous in him, therefore, to repine at the common lot of humanity: to be independent, to have the means of re|turning the obligations Sir Charles Bingley had confer|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">d upo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> him; to be able to comfort and provide for his lovely and long afflicted &s;i&s;ter, and to di&s;tribute relief among&s;t the children of indigence, were all ble&s;&s;ings which would &s;hortly be his: ble&s;&s;ings which demanded his warme&s;t gratitude, and for which he now r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;ed his heart with thankfulne&s;s to their divine di&s;pen&s;er. His feelings grew compo&s;ed; a kind of &s;oft and &s;erene me|lancholy &s;tole over his mind: he &s;till thought of Adela, but not with that kind of di&s;tracting angui&s;h he had &s;o recently experienced; it was with that kind of tender regret which a &s;oul of &s;en&s;ibility feels when reflecting on a departed friend, and to him Adela was as much lo&s;t
<PB N="104" REF="038416_0675_1011E7722B675018">
as if already &s;hrouded in her native clay. "Yes, my love," he &s;aid, as if her gentle &s;pirit had already for&s;a|ken its earthly man&s;ion, "in that happy world we &s;hall be re-united, which only could reward thy goodne&s;s and thy &s;ufferings."</P>
<P>He could now enter into conver&s;ation with his friends about the mea&s;ures which &s;hould be taken to forward his pretentions. It was the opinion of Captain Ru&s;h|brook and Sir Charles, that to make known his claim to the Marquis of Ro&s;line, was all that was nece&s;&s;ary; a claim which they did not imagine he would or could di&s;pute, when &s;uch proofs of its validity as the te&s;timo|ny of Lady Dunreath, and the will, could be produced: was it di&s;puted, it was then time enough to apply el&s;e|where for ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Sir Charles knew the Marquis per&s;onally, and was al&s;o well acquainted in his neighbourhood, and declared he would accompany O&s;car to Scotland. O&s;car thank|ed him for his intention: the &s;upport of a per&s;on &s;o well known, and univer&s;ally e&s;teemed, he was convinced would e&s;&s;entially &s;erve him.</P>
<P>Sir Charles &s;aid regimental bu&s;ine&s;s required his pre|&s;ence in Ireland, which, however, would occa&s;ion no great delay, as he &s;hould have it tran&s;acted in a few days; and as his regiment lay near Donaghadee, they could croo&s;s over to Port Patrick, and in a few hours after reach the Marquis of Ro&s;line's Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>The day after the next he had fixed for commencing his journey, and he a&s;ked O&s;car if it would be agreea|ble and convenient to accompany him then. O&s;car in|&s;tantly a&s;&s;ured him it was both.</P>
<P>Amanda's heart fluttered at the idea of a journey to Ireland; it was probable, &s;he thought, that they would take Wales in their way; and her &s;oul &s;eemed already on the wing to accompany them thither, and be left at the cottage of nur&s;e Edwin, from whence &s;he could again wander through the &s;hades of Tudor-Hall, and take a la&s;t, a &s;ad farewell of them; for &s;he &s;olemnly de|termined, from the moment &s;he &s;hould be appri&s;ed of Lord Mortimer's return to England, to vi&s;it them no
<PB N="105" REF="038416_0676_1011E7750A0886F8">
more: in &s;uch a farewell &s;he believed &s;he &s;hould find a melancholy con&s;olation that would &s;ooth her &s;pirits. She imagined there was no nece&s;&s;ity for accompanying her brother into Scotland, and except told there was an ab&s;olute one&punc; &s;he determined to decline the journey, if &s;he &s;hould be a&s;ked to undertake it. To go to the very &s;pot where &s;he would hear particulars of Lord Mortimer's nuptials &s;he felt would be too much for her fortitude, and might betray to her brother a &s;ecret &s;he had re|&s;olved carefully to conceal from him, as &s;he well knew the pain he would feel from knowing that the pangs of a hopele&s;s attachment were entailed upon her life, and would defeat whatever flattering hopes he entertained for her. Exclu&s;ive of the above-mentioned objections, &s;he could not bear to go to a place where &s;he might, perhaps, witne&s;s the pain which Lord Mortimer mu&s;t unavoidably feel from having any di&s;grace befal a family he was &s;o nearly connected with. O how her heart &s;welled at the idea, that ere O&s;car reached Scotland, the intere&s;t of the Marquis of Ro&s;line and Lord Mortimer would be but one. From her apprehen|&s;ions of being a&s;ked to undertake a journey &s;o truly repugnant to her feelings &s;he was &s;oon relieved, by O&s;car's declaring, that except &s;he wi&s;hed it, he would not a&s;k her to take &s;o fatiguing a one, particularly as her pre&s;ence he could not think at all nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Sir Charles Bingley a&s;&s;ured him it was not, though in a low voice he &s;aid to her, "it was again&s;t his own intere&s;t he &s;poke."</P>
<P>She would now have mentioned her wi&s;h of going to Wales, had not a certain con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s checked her; &s;he feared her countenance would betray her motives for &s;uch a wi&s;h; while &s;he he&s;itated about mentioning it, Sir Charles Bingley told Capt. Ru&s;hbrook, that he had applied to a friend of his in power for a place for him, and had been fortunate enough to make application at the very time there was one of tolerable emolument va|cant, at&mdash;, about &s;eventy miles di&s;tant from Lon|don, whither it would be nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould go as &s;oon
<PB N="106" REF="038416_0677_1011E7769A2F7208">
as po&s;&s;ible. He therefore propo&s;ed that he and Mrs. Ru&s;hbrook &s;hould begin preparations for their journey the en&s;uing morning, and exert them&s;elves to be able to undertake it in the cour&s;e of the week.</P>
<P>They were all rapture and gratitude at this intelli|gence, which opened a pro&s;pect of &s;upport through their own means, and the bread of independence, however hardly earned, which here was not the ca&s;e, mu&s;t ever be &s;weet to &s;ouls of &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>O&s;car looked with anxiety at his &s;i&s;ter, on the men|tion of the Ru&s;hbrook's removal from town, as if to &s;ay, to who&s;e care then can I entru&s;t you. Mrs. Ru&s;h|brook interpreted his look, and in&s;tantly reque&s;ted that Mi&s;s Fitzalan might accompany them, declaring her &s;o|ciety would render their felicity complete. This was the moment for Amanda to &s;peak; &s;he took courage, and mentioned her earne&s;t wi&s;h of vi&s;iting her faithful nur&s;e, declaring &s;he could not lo&s;e &s;o favourable an op|portunity as now offered for the gratification of that wi&s;h, by accompanying her brother into Wales. Emily pleaded, but Amanda, though with the utmo&s;t gratitude and tenderne&s;s, as if to &s;often her refu&s;al, was &s;teady. O&s;car was plea&s;ed with his &s;i&s;ter's determination, as he tru&s;ted going into what might be called her native air, joined to the tender care of nur&s;e Edwin, would recruit her health.</P>
<P>Sir Charles was in raptures at the idea of having her company &s;o far on their way.</P>
<P>Every thing relative to the proceedings of the whole party was arranged before dinner, at which Sir Charles pre&s;ided, giving plea&s;ure to all around him by the inef|fable &s;weetne&s;s of his manner. He withdrew at an early hour at night, and his friends &s;oon after retired to their re&s;pective chambers. On entering the breakfa&s;t room next morning, Amanda found not only her brother and the Ru&s;hbrooks, but Sir Charles Bingley there. Im|mediately after breakfa&s;t he drew O&s;car a&s;ide, and in the mo&s;t delicate terms in&s;i&s;ted on being his banker at pre&s;ent, to which O&s;car gratefully con&s;ented. As &s;oon as this affair was &s;ettled, he put a note into his &s;i&s;ter's
<PB N="107" REF="038416_0678_1011E77A1B55AE40">
hands to purcha&s;e whatever &s;he &s;hould deem nece&s;&s;ary, and &s;he went out with the Ru&s;hbrook's, who, accord|ing to Sir Charles's directions, began preparations for their journey this day. After their return, Sir Charles found an opportunity of again making an offer of his hand to Amanda.</P>
<P>The &s;incere friend&s;hip &s;he had conceived for him, made her determine to terminate his &s;u&s;pence on her ac|count. "Was I to accept your generous propo&s;al, Sir Charles," &s;aid &s;he, "I &s;hould be unworthy of that e&s;teem which it will be my pride to retain, and my plea|&s;ure to return, becau&s;e beyond e&s;teem I cannot go my|&s;elf: it is due to your friend&s;hip," cried &s;he, after the he&s;itation of a moment, whil&s;t a ro&s;y blu&s;h &s;tole over her lovely face, and as quickly faded from it, "to de|clare that ere I &s;aw you the fate of my heart was deci|ded."</P>
<P>Sir Charles, turned pale; he gra&s;ped her hands in a kind of &s;ilent agony to his bo&s;om, then exclaimed, "I will not, Mi&s;s Fitzalan, after your generous confidence, teaze you with farther importunity.</P>

<P>THE en&s;uing morning O&s;car, Amanda, and Sir Charles, began their journey. The Ru&s;hbrooks, who regarded Amanda as the cau&s;e of their pre&s;ent hap|pine&s;s, took leave of her with a tender &s;orrow that deep|ly affected her heart. The journey to Wales was plea|&s;ant and expeditious, the weather being fine, and relays of hor&s;es being provided at every &s;tage. On the eve|ning of the third day they arrived about &s;un-&s;et at the village which lay contiguous to Edwin's abode; from
<PB N="108" REF="038416_0679_1011E77DA87ABF48">
whence, as &s;oon as they had taken &s;ome refre&s;hment, Amanda &s;et off, attended by her brother, for the cot|tage, having ordered her luggage to be brought after her. She would not permit the attendance of Sir Charles, and almo&s;t regretted having travelled with him, as &s;he could not help thinking his pa&s;&s;ion &s;eemed in|crea&s;ed by her having done &s;o. "How dearly," cri|ed he, as he handed her down &s;tairs, "&s;hall I pay for a few &s;hort hours of plea&s;ure, by the uncea&s;ing regret their remembrance will entail upon me."</P>
<P>Amanda withdrew her hand, and bidding him fare|well, hurried on. O&s;car proceeded no farther than the lane which led to the cottage with his &s;i&s;ter. He had no time to an&s;wer the interrogations which its inhabi|tants might deem them&s;elves privileged to make; nei|ther did he wi&s;h his pre&s;ent &s;ituation to be known to any others than tho&s;e already acquainted with it: Amanda therefore meant to &s;ay &s;he had taken the opportunity of travelling &s;o far with two particular friends, who were going to Ireland. O&s;car promi&s;ed to write to her imme|diately from thence, and from Scotland, as &s;oon as he had &s;een the Marquis. He gave her a thou&s;and charges concerning her health, and took a tender farewell. From his too vi&s;ible dejection, Amanda rejoiced &s;he had not revealed her own &s;orrows to him. She tru&s;ted it would be in her power, by &s;oothing attentions, by the thou&s;and little namele&s;s offices of friend&s;hip, to alleviate his, to pluck the thorn from his heart, which rankled within it, was beyond her hopes; in their di&s;po&s;itions, as well as &s;ates, there was too great a &s;imilitude to expect this.</P>
<P>Amanda lingered in the walk as he departed: &s;he was now in the very &s;pot that recalled a thou&s;and fond and tender remembrances; it was here &s;he had given a fare|well look to Tudor Hall, it was here her father had ta|ken a la&s;t look at the &s;pire of the church where his be|loved wife was interred; it was here Lord Mortimer u&s;ed &s;o often to meet her; her &s;oul &s;unk in the heavie&s;t &s;adne&s;s; &s;ighs bur&s;t from her overcharged heart, and with difficulty &s;he prevented her tears from falling; all around was &s;erene and beautiful, but neither the &s;ereni|ty
<PB N="109" REF="038416_0680_1011E77F33914F28">
nor the beauty of the &s;cene could &s;he now enjoy; the plaintive bleating of the cattle, that rambled about the adjacent hills, only heightened her melancholy, and the appearance of autumn, which was now far advan|ced, only made her look back to the happy period when admiring its luxuriance had given her delight; the parting &s;un-beams yet glittered on the windows of Tu|dor Hall; &s;he pau&s;ed involuntarily to contemplate it; hours could &s;he have continued in the &s;ame &s;ituation, had not the idea that &s;he might be ob&s;erved from the cottage made her at la&s;t ha&s;ten to it.</P>
<P>The door lay open; &s;he entered, and found only the nur&s;e within, employed at knitting. Her a&s;toni&s;hment at the appearance of Amanda is not to be de&s;cribed.&mdash;She &s;tarted, &s;creamed, &s;urveyed her a minute, as if doubting the evidence of her eyes; then running to her, flung he arms about her neck, and cla&s;ped her to her bo&s;om.</P>
<P>"Good gracious!" cried &s;he, "well, to pe &s;ure, who ever would thought of &s;uch a thing; well, to pe &s;ure, you are as welcome as the flowers in May. Here we have been in &s;uch peck of troubles about you, ma|ny and many a time has my good man &s;aid, that if he knew where you were he would go to you." Aman|da returned the embraces of her faithful nur&s;e, and they both &s;at down together.</P>
<P>"Ah! I fear," &s;aid the nur&s;e, looking tenderly at her for a few minutes, "you have been in a &s;ad way &s;ince I la&s;t &s;aw you. The poor tear Captain, alack! little did I think when he took you away from us I &s;hould never &s;ee him more!" Amanda's tears could no longer be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, they gu&s;hed in torrents from her, and her deep &s;obs &s;poke the bitterne&s;s of her feelings.</P>
<P>"Aye," &s;aid the nur&s;e, wiping her eyes with the corner of her apron, "gentle or &s;imple, &s;ooner or later, we mu&s;t all go the &s;ame way: &s;o, my tear child, don't take it &s;o much to heart. Well, to pe &s;ure, long pefore this I thought I &s;hould have &s;een or heard of your being greatly married; put I pelieve it is true enough, that
<PB N="110" REF="038416_0681_1011E78238F29918">
men are like the wind, always changing. Any one that has &s;een Lord Mortimer after you went away would never have thought he could prove fickle; he was in &s;uch grief my very heart and &s;oul pitied him; to pe &s;ure, if I had known where you were I &s;hould have told him: I comforted my&s;elf, however, by thinking he would certainly find you out, when, Lort! in&s;tead of looking for you, here he's going to be married to a great Laty, with &s;uch a long hard name, a Scotch heir|e&s;s I think they call her; aye, golt is every thing in the&s;e days. Well, all the harm I wi&s;h him is, that &s;he may plague his life out.</P>
<P>This di&s;cour&s;e was too painful to Amanda; her tears had &s;ub&s;ided, and &s;he endeavoured to change it, by a&s;k|ing after the nur&s;e's family. The nur&s;e, in a ha&s;ty manner, &s;aid they were well, and thus proceeded:&mdash;"Then there is Par&s;on Howell, I am &s;ure one would have thought him as &s;teady as Penmaenmawr, but no &s;uch thing: I am &s;ure he has changed, for he does not come to the cottage half &s;o often to a&s;k about you as he u&s;ed to do."</P>
<P>Amanda, notwith&s;tanding her dejection, &s;miled at the nur&s;e's anger about the curate, and again reque&s;ted to hear particulars of her family. The nur&s;e no longer he&s;itated to comply with her reque&s;t; She informed her they were all well, and then at a little tance at the mill in the valle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. She al&s;o added, that Ellen was mar|ried to her faithful Chip, had a comfortable cottage, and a fine little girl &s;he was nur&s;ing, and to whom, from her love to her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ear young La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y, &s;he would have given the name of Amanda; but that &s;he &s;eared people would deem her conceited to give it &s;o fine a one. The nur&s;e &s;aid &s;he often regretted having left her tear young Laty, and then, even Chip him&s;elf could not con&s;ole her for having done &s;o, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> again &s;tarted to Amanda's eyes at hearing of the unabated attachment of her poor Ellen, &s;he longed to &s;ee, and congratulate her on her pre&s;ent happine&s;s. The nur&s;e, in her turn, enquired into all that had befallen Amanda &s;ince their &s;eparation, and &s;hed tears at hearing of her dear child's &s;ufferings &s;ince that
<PB N="111" REF="038416_0682_1011E784AF08F848">
period. She a&s;ked about O&s;car, and was briefly informed he was well. The family &s;oon returned, from the dance, and it would be difficult to &s;ay whether &s;urpri&s;e or joy was mo&s;t predominant at &s;eeing Amanda. One of the young men ran over for Ellen, and returned in a few minutes with her, followed by her hu&s;band, carrying his little child. She looked with wild delight. She cla&s;ped Amanda in her arms, as if &s;he would never let her depart from them, and wept in the fullne&s;s of her heart. "Now&mdash;now," cried &s;he, "I &s;hall be quite happy; but, oh! why, my tear young Laty, did you not come among&s;t us pe&s;ore? you know all in our power we would have done to render you happy." She now re|collected her&s;elf, and mode&s;tly retired to a little di&s;tance. She took her child and brought it to Amanda, who de|lighted her extremely by the notice &s;he took of it a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d Chip. If Amanda had had le&s;s cau&s;e for grief, the at|tentions of the&s;e affectionate cottagers would have &s;oothed her mind; but at pre&s;ent nothing could dimin|i&s;h her dejection. Her luggage was by this time arriv|ed; &s;he had brought pre&s;ents for all the family and now di&s;tributed them. She tried to conver&s;e about their dome&s;tic affairs, but found her&s;elf unequal to the effort and begged to be &s;hewn to her chamber. The nur&s;e would not &s;uffer her to retire till &s;he had ta&s;ted her new chee&s;e and Welch ale. When alone within it &s;he found fre&s;h objects to remind her of Lord Mortimer, and con|&s;equently to augment her grief; here lay the book ca&s;e he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ent her. She opened it with trembling impatience; but &s;carcely a volume did &s;he examine, in which &s;elect pa&s;&s;ages were not marked by his hand for her particular peru&s;al. Oh! what mementos were tho&s;e volumes of the happy hour &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed at the cottage; the night wan|ed away, and &s;till &s;he continued weeping over them. She could with difficulty bring her&s;elf to clo&s;e the book-ca&s;e, and when &s;he retired to re&s;t her &s;lumbers were &s;hort and unrefre&s;hing. The next morning, as &s;he &s;at at breakfa&s;t a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly attended by the nur&s;e and her daughters (for Ellen had come over early to enquire after her health) Howell entered to pay her a vi&s;it; the previous intima|tions

&s;he had received of the alteration in his &s;entiments, rendered his vi&s;it more plea&s;ing than it would otherwi&s;e have been to her; his plea&s;ure was great at &s;eeing her, but it was not the wild and extravagant delight of a lover, but the &s;oft and placid joy of a friend. After his departure, which was not &s;oon, &s;he accompanied Ellen to view her cottage, and was infinitely plea&s;ed by its neatne&s;s and romantic &s;ituation; it lay on the &s;ide of a hill, which commanded a beautiful pro&s;pect of Tudor-Hall; every thing &s;he beheld reminded Amanda of Lord Mortimer, even the balmy air &s;he breathed, on which his voice had &s;o often floated.</P>
<P>The &s;ad indulgence of wandering through the &s;hades of Tudor Hall, which &s;he had &s;o eagerly de&s;ired, and fondly anticipated, &s;he could not long deny her&s;elf.&mdash;The &s;econd evening after her arrival at the cottage, &s;he turned her &s;olitary &s;teps to them; their deep embower|ing glens, their &s;olitude, their &s;ilence, &s;uited the pen|&s;ive turn of her feelings: here, undi&s;turbed and unob|&s;erved, &s;he could indulge the &s;orrows of her heart; and oh! how did recollection augment tho&s;e &s;orrows, by re|tracing the happy hours &s;he had &s;pent within tho&s;e &s;hades. A cold, a death-like melancholy pervaded her feelings, and &s;eemed repelling the movements of life; her trembling limbs were unable to &s;upport her, and &s;he threw her&s;elf on the ground. For &s;ome minutes &s;he could &s;carcely breathe; tears at length relieved her pain|ful oppre&s;&s;ion, &s;he rai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed her languid head, &s;he looked around, and wept with encrea&s;ing violence, at beholding what might be termed mementos of former happine&s;s. She repeated, in &s;oft and tremulous accents, the name of Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">timer; but as the beloved name vibrated on her ear, how did &s;he &s;tart at recollecting, that &s;he was then calling upon the hu&s;band of Lady Euphra&s;ia.&mdash;She felt a momentary glow upon her cheeks; &s;he aro&s;e, and &s;ighed deeply. I will &s;trive to do right, &s;he cried, I will try to wean my &s;oul from remembrances no long|er proper to be indulged. Yet &s;till &s;he lingered in the wood; the en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rea&s;ing gloom of evening rendered it, if po&s;&s;ible, more plea&s;ing to her feelings, whil&s;t the breeze

&s;ighed mournfully through the trees, and the droning Bat fluttered in the air, upon which the wild mu&s;ic of a harp from one of the neighbouring cottages &s;oftly floated.</P>
<P>Amanda drew nearer to it; it looked dark and me|lancholy; &s;he &s;ighed; &s;he involuntarily exclaimed, oh! how &s;oon will it be enlivened by bridal pomp and fe&s;ti|vity.</P>
<P>She now recollected the unea&s;ine&s;s her long ab&s;ence might create at the cottage, and as &s;oon as the idea oc|curred, ha&s;tened to it. She met Edwin in the lane, who had been di&s;patched by his wife in que&s;t of her. The good woman expre&s;&s;ed her fears, that &s;uch late rambles would injure the health of Amanda; "it was a &s;ad thing," &s;he &s;aid, "to &s;ee young people giving way to di&s;mal fancies.</P>
<P>Amanda did not confine her rambles entirely to Tu|dor Hall; &s;he vi&s;ited all the &s;pots where &s;he and Lord Mortimer u&s;ed to ramble together. She went to the humble &s;pot where her mother lay interred. Her feel|ings were now infinitely more painful than when &s;he had fir&s;t &s;een it; it recalled to her mind, in the mo&s;t agonizing manner, all the vici&s;&s;itudes &s;he had experienc|ed &s;ince that period; it recalled to view the calamitous clo&s;ure of her father's life; the &s;orrows, the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of that life, and &s;he felt overwhelmed with grief; &s;carce|ly could &s;he prevent her&s;elf from falling on the grave, and giving way, in tears and lamentations, to that grief. Deprived of the deare&s;t connexions of life; bla&s;ted in hopes and expectations, oh! well had it been for me, &s;he cried, had this &s;pot at once received the mother and the child:&mdash;and yet, &s;he exclaimed, after a minute's re|flection, oh! what, my God, am I, that I &s;hould dare to murmur or repine at thy decrees? Oh! pardon the in|voluntary expre&s;&s;ion of a woe-worn heart, of a heart that feels the pure&s;t gratitude for thy protection through pa&s;t dangers. Oh! how pre&s;umptuous, &s;he continued, to repine at the common lot of humanity&mdash;at the lot of her, &s;he continued, ca&s;ting her tearful eyes upon the grave, where the la&s;t flowers of autumn were now wi|thering, who repo&s;es in this earthly bed, who in life's

meridian, in beauty's prime, &s;unk the &s;ad victim of &s;or|row into the arms of death. Oh! my parents, how ca|lamitous were your de&s;tinies? even your a&s;hes were not permitted to &s;houlder together; but in a happier region your kindred &s;pirits are now united. Ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirits! your child will &s;trive to imitate your example; in pa|tient re&s;ignation to the will of heaven, &s;he will endea|vour to &s;upport life; &s;he will &s;trive to live, though not from an idea of enjoying happine&s;s, but from an humble hope of being able to di&s;pen&s;e it to others.</P>
<P>Such were the words of Amanda at the grave of her mother, from which &s;he turned like a pale and drooping lily, &s;urcharged with tears.</P>
<P>At the end of a week &s;he heard from O&s;car, who told her in the cour&s;e of a few days he expected to embark for Scotland. Amanda had brought materials for draw|ing with her, and &s;he felt a pa&s;&s;ionate de&s;ire of taking views of Tudor-Hall; views &s;he believed would yield her a melancholy plea&s;ure, when &s;he &s;hould be far, and for ever di&s;tant from the &s;pots they repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>This de&s;ire, however, &s;he could not gratify, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of her nur&s;e, for &s;he meant to take her views from the library, and &s;he feared if &s;he went there without apprizing the hou&s;e-keeper, &s;he &s;hould be liable to interruption. She therefore reque&s;ted her nur&s;e to a&s;k permi&s;&s;ion for her to go there. The nur&s;e &s;hook her head as if &s;he &s;u&s;pected Amanda had a motive for the re|que&s;t, &s;he did not divulge. She was, however, too anxi|ous to gratify her dear child, to refu&s;e complying with it, and accordingly lo&s;t no time in a&s;king the de&s;ired per|mi&s;&s;ion which Mrs. Abergwilly readily gave, &s;aying, "Mi&s;s Fitzalan was welcome to go to the library when|ever &s;he plea&s;ed, and &s;hould not be interrupted."</P>
<P>Amanda did not delay availing her&s;elf of this permi&s;|&s;ion, but it was &s;ome time after &s;he entered the library, ere &s;he could compo&s;e her&s;elf &s;ufficiently for the purpo&s;e which had brought her to it. In vain did nature appear from the windows, di&s;playing the mo&s;t beautiful and ro|mantic &s;cenery to her view, as if to tempt her to take up the pencil. Her eyes were d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">mmed with tears as &s;he
<PB N="115" REF="038416_0686_1011E78E86F989A8">
looked upon this &s;cenery, and reflected, that he who had once pointed out its various beauties, was lo&s;t to her for|ever. By degrees, however, her feelings grew compo&s;ed, and every morning &s;he repaired to the library, feeling, whil&s;t engaged within it, a t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">mpory alleviation of &s;orrow.</P>
<P>Three weeks pa&s;&s;ed in this manner, and at the expi|ration of that period, &s;he received a letter from O&s;car. She trembled in the mo&s;t violent agitation as &s;he broke the &s;eal, for &s;he &s;aw, by the po&s;t ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">k, he was in Scot|land; but how great was her &s;urpri&s;e and joy at the contents of this letter, which informed her, every thing relative to the important affair &s;o lately in agitation, was &s;ettled in the mo&s;t amicable manner: that the avowal of his claim occa&s;ioned not the &s;malle&s;t litiga|tion; that he was then in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fortune bequeathed him by the Earl, and had already received the congratulation of the neighbouring families on his acce&s;&s;ion, or rather re&s;toration to it. He had not time, he &s;aid, to enumerate the many particulars which ren|dered the adju&s;tment of affairs &s;o ea&s;y, and hoped the plea&s;ing intelligence his letter communicated, would atone for its brevity; he added he was then preparing to &s;et off for London, with Sir Charles Bingley, of who&s;e friend&s;hip he &s;poke in the highe&s;t terms, to &s;ettle &s;ome affairs relative to his new po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and particularly about the revival of the Dunreath, title, which, not from any o&s;tentatious pride, he de&s;ired to obtain, as he was &s;ure &s;he would &s;uppo&s;e, but from gratitude and re&s;pect to the wi&s;hes of his grandfather, who, in his will, had expre&s;t his de&s;ire that the honours of his family &s;hould be &s;upported by his heir. When every thing was finally &s;ettled, he proceeded to &s;ay, he would ha&s;ten on the wings of love and impatience to her, for in her &s;weet &s;ociety alone, he found any balm for the &s;orrows of his heart, &s;orrows which could not be eradicated from it, though fortune had been &s;o unexpectedly propitious; and he hoped, he &s;aid, he &s;hould find her then gay as the birds, blooming as the flowers of &s;pring, and ready

to accompany him to the venerable man&s;ion of their ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>The joyful intelligence this letter communicated &s;he had not &s;pirits at pre&s;ent to mention to the inhabitants of the cottage; the plea&s;ure it afforded was only damp|ed by reflecting on what Lord Mortimer mu&s;t feel from a di&s;covery which could not fail of ca&s;ting a dark &s;hade of obloquy upon his new connexions. She was n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">w doubly anxious to fini&s;h her land&s;capes, from the pro&s;|pect there wes for quitting Wales &s;o &s;oon. Every vi&s;it &s;he now paid the library was paid with the &s;ad idea of its being the la&s;t. As &s;he was preparing for going there one morning, immediately after breakfa&s;t, the nur&s;e, who had been out &s;ome time previous to her ri&s;ing, en|tered the room with a look of breathle&s;s impatience, which &s;eemed to declare &s;he had &s;omething wonderful to communicate. "Goot lack-a-tai&s;y," cried &s;he, as &s;oon as &s;he had recovered her breath, lifting up her head from the back of the chair on which &s;he had thrown her&s;elf, "goot lack-a-tai&s;y, well to pe &s;ure, there is nothing put wonderful things happening in this world! Here old Dame Abergwilly &s;ent in &s;uch a hurry for me this morning; to pe &s;ure I was &s;urpri&s;ed, put what was that to the &s;urpri&s;e I felt, when I heard what &s;he had &s;ent to me for." It was not Amanda's turn to feel breath|le&s;s impatience. "Good Heavens!" &s;he exclaimed, "what did &s;he tell you?"</P>
<P>"Aye, I knew," cried the nur&s;e, "the commotion you would be in when I told you the news; if you were gue&s;&s;ing from this time till this time to-morrow, you would never &s;tumble upon what it is."</P>
<P>"I dare &s;ay I &s;hould not," cried Amanda, "&s;o do be brief."</P>
<P>"Why, you mu&s;t know&mdash;put, Lort, my tear chilt, I am afraid you made but a bad breakfa&s;t, for you look very pale; inteed I made no great one my&s;elf, for I was in &s;uch a hurry &s;lurry with what Mrs. Abergwilly told me, that, though &s;he made &s;ome nice green tea, and we had a &s;lim cake, I could &s;carcely touch any thing."</P>
<P><PB N="117" REF="038416_0688_1011D04EC82FEE98">
"Well," &s;aid Amanda, tortured with anxiety and impatience, "what did &s;he t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ll you?"</P>
<P>"Why, my tear chilt, down came a &s;pecial me&s;&s;enger from London la&s;t night, to let them know that Lort Cherbury was tead, and that Lort Mortimer had &s;old Tudor-Hall, and the &s;teward is ordered to pay all the &s;ervants off, and ti&s;charge them and to have every thing in readine&s;s again&s;t the new lantlort comes down to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.&mdash;Oh! Lort, there is &s;uch weeping and wailing at the Hall, the poor creatures, who had grown old in the &s;ervice, hoped to have fini&s;hed their tays in it; it is not that they are in fear of want, the young Lort has taken care of that, for he has &s;ettled &s;omething yearly upon them all, but that they are &s;orry to quit the family. Poor Mrs. Abergwilly, nothing can comfort the old &s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l; &s;he has neither chick nor child, and &s;he told me &s;he loved the very chairs and tables, to which to pe &s;ure her hand has given many a poli&s;hing rub. She &s;ays &s;he thinks &s;he will come and lodge with me; put if &s;he does, &s;he &s;ays I mu&s;t not put her in a room from whence &s;he can have a view of Tudor Hall, for &s;he &s;ays &s;he will never be able to look at it when once it gets a new ma&s;ter; &s;o this my dear chilt, is the &s;um totem of what I have heard."</P>
<P>Amanda was equally a&s;toni&s;hed and affected by what &s;he heard. She wi&s;hed to know if the nur&s;e had re|ceived any intelligence of Lord Mortimer's marriage, but &s;he could not bring her&s;elf to a&s;k the que&s;tion; be|&s;ides, upon reflection, &s;he was convinced &s;he &s;hould have heard it had it been the ca&s;e. With Lord Cherbury died all hopes of the re&s;toration of her fame in the opinion of his &s;on: "Yet why," &s;he a&s;ked her&s;elf, "&s;hould I re|gret this? Since thus &s;eparated, it is better, perhaps, he had cea&s;ed to e&s;teem me, as undoubtedly it mu&s;t le&s;&s;en his feelings on my account." Why he &s;hould part&punc; with Tudor-Hall &s;he could not conceive, except it was to hu|mour &s;ome caprice of lady Emphra&s;ia's, who it was pro|bable (&s;he imagined) knew that the attachment between Lord Mortimer and her had there commenced. "Ah!"
<PB N="118" REF="038416_0689_1011E7978DF93D70">
cried Amanda, "&s;he never could have reli&s;hed its beau|ties&mdash;beauties which, if Lord Mortimer thinks as I do, would, if reviewed, only have augmented his &s;orrows&mdash;&s;orrows which propriety now demands his repelling."&mdash;She ha&s;tened to the hall, but was &s;ometime there ere &s;he could commence her employment, &s;o much had &s;he been agitated. The land&s;cape &s;he was fini&s;hing was taken from the little valley which lay beneath the win|dows of the mu&s;ic-room, the romantic ruins of an old ca&s;tle overhung an eminence at its extremity; and of the whole &s;cene &s;he had taken a mo&s;t accurate copy; it wanted but one charm to plea&s;e her, and that charm was the figure of Lord Mortimer, with whom &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ad often wandered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound the ruins. Her hand was ready in obeying the impul&s;e of her heart, and &s;he &s;oon beheld &s;ketched, in the mo&s;t &s;triking manner, the elegant fea|tures of him &s;o ardently beloved. She gazed with rap|ture upon them, but it was a &s;hort lived rapture. She &s;tarted, as if con&s;cious &s;he had committed a crime, when &s;he reflected on the &s;ituation in which he now &s;tood with another woman; her trembling hand ha&s;tened to atone for its error, by expunging the dangerous likene&s;s, and the warm involuntary tear &s;he &s;hed at the moment aided her de&s;ign. "Oh! how unnece&s;&s;ary," &s;he cried, as &s;he made this &s;acrifice to delicacy, "to &s;ketch features which are indelibly engraven on my heart." As &s;he &s;poke a deep and long drawn &s;igh reached her ear: alarmed, confounded at the idea of being overheard and of cour&s;e the feelings of her heart di&s;covered, &s;he &s;tarted, with precipitation from her &s;eat, and looked around her with a kind of wild confu&s;ion; but gracious Heavens! who can de&s;cribe the emotions of her &s;oul, when the original of that picture, &s;o fondly &s;ketched, &s;o ha&s;tily obliterated, met her eye. Amazed, unable to &s;peak, to move, almo&s;t to breathe, &s;he &s;tood motionle&s;s and agha&s;t, the pale &s;tatue of &s;urpri&s;e, as if &s;he neither dur&s;t or could believe the evidence of her eyes. Well, indeed, might &s;he have doubted them, for in the pale countenance of Lord Mortimer &s;carce a ve&s;tige of his former &s;elf (except in the bemgnancy of his looks) re|mained.

His faded complexion, the di&s;order of his hair, his mourning habit, all heightened the &s;ad expre&s;&s;ion of his features, an expre&s;&s;ion which declared that he a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> were never &s;o di&s;united as at the pre&s;ent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the fir&s;t violence of Amanda's feelings in a little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">bating, &s;he &s;omewhat recovered the u&s;e of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and ha&s;tily &s;natching up her drawings, moved with weak and trembling &s;teps to the door. She had nearly reached it, when the &s;oft, the tremulous voice of Lord Mortimer arre&s;ted her cour&s;e. "You go, then, Mi&s;s Fitzalan," cried he, "without one adieu; you go, and we never more &s;hall meet." The agonizing man|ner in which tho&s;e words were pronounced, &s;truck a death-like chill upon the heart of Amanda. She &s;top|ped and turned around involuntarily, as if to receive that la&s;t, and &s;ad adieu, which &s;he was half reproached for avoiding. Lord Mortimer approached her; he attempt|ed to &s;peak, but his voice was inarticulate; a gu&s;t of &s;orrow bur&s;t from his eyes, and he ha&s;tily covered his face with a handkerchief, and walked to a window.</P>
<P>Amanda, unutterably affected, was unable to &s;tand, &s;he &s;unk upon a chair, and watched with a bur&s;ting heart the emotions of Lord Mortimer. Oh! with what difficulty at this moment did &s;he confine her&s;elf with|in the cold, the rigid rules of propriety&mdash;with what dif|ficulty did &s;he prevent her&s;elf from flying to Lord Mor|timer&mdash;from mingling tears with his, and lamenting the cruel de&s;tiny which had di&s;united them forever. Lord Mortimer in a few minutes was &s;ufficiently recovered again to approach her. "I have long wi&s;hed for an op|portunity of &s;eeing you," &s;aid he, "but had not cou|rage to de&s;ire an interview. How little did I imagine this morning, when, like a &s;ad exile, I came to take a la&s;t farewell of a favourite re&s;idence, that I &s;hould be|hold you!

To expre&s;s my horror, my remor&s;e, my angui&s;h, not only for the error a combination of events influenced me into concerning you&mdash;but for the conduct that error led me to adopt, will, I think, a little lighten my heart; to receive your pardon will be a &s;weet, a &s;ad

Alas! the &s;weetne&s;s that may lead you to accord it, will only heighten my wretchedne&s;s at our eternal &s;eparation." Here he pau&s;ed. Amanda was unable to &s;peak. His words &s;eemed to imply he was acquainted with the inju|ries &s;he had &s;u&s;tained through his father's means, and &s;he waited in trembling expectation, for an explanation of them. "The purity of your character," exclaimed Lord Mortimer, "was at length fully revealed to me. Good heaven! under what afflicting circum&s;tances? By that Being, to whom you &s;o generou&s;ly made a &s;a|crifice of what then&mdash;you might have con&s;idered your happine&s;s."</P>
<P>"Did Lord Cherbury, then," &s;aid Amanda, with inexpre&s;&s;ible eagerne&s;s, "did he then (at la&s;t) ju&s;tify me?"</P>
<P>"Yes," cried Lord Mortimer, "he proved you were indeed the mo&s;t excellent, the mo&s;t injured of human beings, that you were all which my fond heart had once believed you to be; but, oh! what were the dreadful emotions of that heart to know his ju&s;tification came too late to re&s;tore its peace. Once there was a happy period, when, after a &s;imilar error being removed, I had hoped, by a life forever devoted to you, to have made &s;ome reparation, &s;ome atonement, for my invo|luntary inju&s;tice; but alas! no reparation, no atone|ment, can now be made."</P>
<P>Amanda wept; &s;he rai&s;ed her &s;treaming eyes to hea|ven, and again ca&s;t them to the earth.</P>
<P>"You weep," cried Lord Mortimer, in a tone ex|pre&s;&s;ive of &s;urpri&s;e, after &s;urveying her &s;ome minutes in &s;ilence; "my love, my Amanda," continued he, &s;uddenly &s;eizing her hand, while he &s;urveyed her with a mo&s;t rapturous fondne&s;s, a crim&s;on glow mantling his cheek, and a beam of wanted brilliancy da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ing from his eye: "What am I to imagine from tho&s;e tears?

<P>Amanda had now reache<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> door; her heart recoil|ed at the idea of parting in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a manner from Lord Mortimer, but prudence bid her ha&s;ten as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;i|ble from him; yet &s;low and lingering &s;he pur&s;ued her way: ere &s;he had gone many yards, &s;he was overtaken by Lord Mortimer; his pride was inferior to his tender|ne&s;s, which drove him to de&s;pair at the idea of his parting in di&s;plea&s;ure from her. "Oh! my Amanda," cried he, &s;eizing her hand, and almo&s;t breathle&s;s with emotion, "add not, by your anger, to the bitterne&s;s of this &s;ad hour; &s;ince we mu&s;t part, oh! let us part in amity as friends that regard each other. You have not yet (if indeed it is po&s;&s;ible for you to do &s;o) pronounced your forgivene&s;s of the per&s;ecutions you underwent on my account; you have not yet granted your pardon for the har&s;hne&s;s, the cruelty with which a dreadful error tempted me to treat you."</P>
<P>"Oh! my Lord," &s;aid Amanda, again yielding to the &s;oftne&s;s of her &s;oul, while tears trickled down her cheeks, "why torture me by &s;peaking in this manner? How can I pronounce forgivene&s;s when I never was of|fended? when wretched and de&s;erted I appeared to &s;tand upon the great theatre of life, without one hand to offer me a&s;&s;i&s;tance, your ready friend&s;hip came to my relief, and poured the balm of comfort over the &s;orrows of my

heart? when deprived by deceit and cruelty of your good opinion, even then your attention and &s;olicitude pur&s;ued my wandering foot&s;teps, and &s;trove to mark a path of comfort for me to take? The&s;e, the&s;e are obligations that never can be forgotten, that demand, that po&s;&s;e&s;s my eternal gratitude, my&mdash;." A warmer expre&s;&s;ion ro&s;e to her lips, but was again buried in her heart. She &s;ighed, and after a pau&s;e of a minute, thus went on: "For your happine&s;s, my warme&s;t, pure&s;t prayers are daily offered up; oh! may it yet be equal to your vir|tues, greater I cannot wi&s;h it."</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer groaned in the excruciating agony of his &s;oul. "Oh! Amanda," he &s;aid, "where&mdash;where can I receive con&s;olation for your lo&s;s? Never&mdash;never in this world!" He took her hands within his, he rai&s;ed them to Heaven, as if &s;upplicating its choice&s;t ble&s;&s;ings on her head; "For my happine&s;s you pray," he ex|claimed&mdash;"ah! my love, how unavailing is the prayer!"</P>
<P>Amanda now &s;aw more than ever the nece&s;&s;ity of ha&s;tening away. She gently withdrew her hands, and hurried on as fa&s;t as her trembling limbs could carry her. Still Lord Mortimer attended her: Yet Amanda, cried he," a little moment. Tell me," he continued, again &s;eizing her hand, "Do not the&s;e &s;hades remind you of departed hours? Oh! what bli&s;sful ones have we not pa&s;&s;ed beneath their foliage, that foliage which I &s;hall never more behold expanding to the breath of &s;pring."</P>
<P>Amanda trembled: this involuntary, but &s;ad dclara|tion of the lo&s;s of a &s;eat &s;o valued by him, overpowered her; her re&s;piration grew faint, &s;he could not &s;upport her&s;elf, and made a motion to &s;it down upon the gra&s;s, but Lord Mortimer eagerly caught her to his bo&s;om. She had not &s;trength to re&s;i&s;t the effort, and her head reclined upon his &s;houlder; but who can &s;peak her feel|ings, as &s;he felt the beating heart of Mortimer, which, from its violent palpitations, &s;eemed as if it would bur&s;t his bo&s;om to find a pa&s;&s;age to her feet. In a few minutes &s;he was a little recovered, and &s;en&s;ible of the impropriety of her &s;ituation, was now re&s;olutely determined to quit Lord Mortimer. "We mu&s;t part, my Lord," cried &s;he,
<PB N="123" REF="038416_0694_1011E7A3717865F0">
di&s;engaging her&s;elf from his arms, notwith&s;tanding a gentle effort he made to detain her; "we mu&s;t part, my Lord," &s;he repeated, "and part for ever."</P>
<P>"Tell me, then," he exclaimed, &s;till impeding her cour&s;e, "tell me whether I may &s;till hope to live in your remembrance, whether I may hope not to be obliterated from your memory by the happine&s;s which will &s;hortly &s;urround you; promi&s;e I &s;hall at times be thought of with your wonted, though, alas! unavailing wi&s;hes for my happine&s;s, and the promi&s;e will perhaps afford me con&s;olation in the &s;olitary exile I have doomed my&s;elf to."</P>
<P>"Oh! my Lord," &s;aid Amanda, unable to repre&s;s her feelings, "why do I hear you &s;peak in this manner? In mentioning exile, do you not declare your intention of leaving unfulfilled the claims which &s;ituation, family and &s;ociety have upon you? Oh! my Lord, you &s;hock, &s;hall I &s;ay more, you di&s;appoint me! Yes, I repeat it, di&s;ap|point the idea I had formed of the virtue and fortitude of him who, as a friend, I &s;hall ever regard: to yield thus to &s;orrow, to neglect the incumbent duties of life, to abandon a woman to whom &s;o lately you plighted your &s;olemn vows of love and protection: Oh! my Lord, what will her friends, what will Lady Euphra&s;ia her&s;elf &s;ay to &s;uch cruel, &s;uch unju&s;tifiable conduct?"</P>
<P>"Lady Euphra&s;ia!" repeated Lord Mortimer, recoil|ing a few paces, "Lady Euphra&s;ia!" he again exclaim|ed in tremulous accents, regarding Amanda with an expre&s;&s;ion of mingled horror and wildne&s;s, "Gracious Heaven! is it, can it be po&s;&s;ible you are ignorant of the circum&s;tances which lately happened? Yes, your words, your looks declare you are &s;o."</P>
<P>It was now Amanda's turn to repeat his words. She demanded, with a wildne&s;s of countenance, equal to that he had ju&s;t di&s;played, "what were the circum&s;tances he alluded to?</P>
<P>"Fir&s;t tell me," cried he, was the alteration in your manner produced by you &s;uppo&s;ing me the hu&s;band of Euphra&s;ia?"</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="038416_0695_1011E7A8434D6DB0">
"Suppo&s;ing you her hu&s;band!" repeated Amanda, unable to an&s;wer his que&s;tion, in a moment of &s;uch tor|turing &s;u&s;pen&s;e: "And are you not &s;o?"</P>
<P>"No," replied Lord Mortimer, "I never had the misfortune to offer vows which my heart could not ratify. Lady Euphra&s;ia made another choice. She was your enemy, but I know your gentle &s;pirit will mourn her &s;ad and &s;udden fate." He cea&s;ed, for Amanda had no longer power to li&s;ten; &s;he &s;unk, beneath &s;urpri&s;e and joy, into the expanded arms of her beloved Mortimer. It is ye alone who, like her, have &s;tood upon the very brink of de&s;pair, who, like her, have been re&s;tored, un|expectedly re&s;tored to hope, to happine&s;s, that can form any judgment of her feelings at the pre&s;ent moment&mdash;at the moment when recovering from her in&s;en&s;ibility, the &s;oft accent of Lord Mortimer &s;aluted her ear, and made her heart, without one cen&s;ure from propriety, re&s;pond to rapture, as he held her to his bo&s;om; as he gazed on her with tears of impa&s;&s;ioned tenderne&s;s, he repeated his que&s;tion, whether the alteration in her manner was produced alone by the &s;uppo&s;ition of his marriage; but he repeated it with a &s;weet, a happy con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having it an&s;wered according to his wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>"The&s;e tears, the&s;e emotions, oh! Mortimer, what do they declare?" exclaimed Amanda: "Ah! do they not &s;ay my heart never knew a diminution of tenderne&s;s, that it never could have forgotten you. Yes," &s;he con|tinued, rai&s;ing her eyes, &s;treaming with tears of rapture, to Heaven, "I am now recompen&s;ed for all my &s;uffer|ings: yes, in this bli&s;sful moment I meet a full reward for them." Lord Mortimer now led her back to the library, to give an explanation of the events which had produced &s;o great a rever&s;e of &s;ituation; but it was long ere he could &s;ufficiently compo&s;e him&s;elf to commence his narrative; alternately he fell at the feet of Amanda, alternately he folded her to his bo&s;om, and a&s;ked his heart if its pre&s;ent happine&s;s was real. A thou&s;and times he que&s;tioned her whether &s;he was indeed unalter|ed, as often implored her forgivene&s;s for one moment
<PB N="125" REF="038416_0696_1011E7AAF23ABBF0">
doubting her con&s;tancy. Amanda exerted her &s;pirits to calm her own agitation, that &s;he might be enabled to &s;ooth him into tranquillity. At length &s;he &s;ucceeded, and he terminated her anxious impatience by giving her the promi&s;ed relation.</P>

<P>OVERWHELMED with grief and di&s;ap|pointment a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;uppo&s;ed perfidy of Amanda, Lord Mortimer had returned to England, acquainting Lord Cherbury and Lady Martha of the unhappy cau&s;e of his returning alone; entreating them, in pity to his wound|ed feelings, never to mention the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ubject before him. His dejection was unconquerable; all his &s;chemes of felicity were overthrown, and the de&s;truction of his hopes was the de&s;truction of his peace. It was not in the&s;e fir&s;t tran&s;ports of bitter &s;orrow that Lord Cher|bury ventured to &s;peak his wi&s;hes to his &s;on: he waited till by &s;low degrees he &s;aw a greater degree of compo|&s;ure in his manner, though it was a compo&s;ure attended with no abatement of melancholy. At fir&s;t he only hinted tho&s;e wi&s;hes; hints, however, which Lord Mor|timer appeared de&s;ignedly in&s;en&s;ible of. At la&s;t the Earl &s;poke plainer; he mentioned his deep regret at be|holding a &s;on, whom he had ever con&s;idered the pride of his hou&s;e, and the &s;olace of his days, wa&s;ting his youth in wretchedne&s;s for an ungrateful woman, who had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ong triumphed in the infatuation which bound him to her: it filled his &s;oul with angui&s;h, he &s;aid, to behold him lo&s;t to him&s;elf, his family, and the world, thus di&s;appointing all the hopes and expectations which the fair promi&s;e of
<PB N="126" REF="038416_0697_1011E7AC9580B708">
his early youth had given ri&s;e to in the bo&s;om of his friends, concerning the meridian of his day.</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer was unutterably affected by what his father &s;aid. The Earl beheld his emotions, and ble&s;t it as a happy omen. His pride, as well as &s;en&s;ibility, he continued, were deeply wounded at the idea of having Lord Mortimer &s;till con&s;idered the &s;lave of a pa&s;&s;ion which had met &s;o ba&s;e a return. Oh! let not the world, added he, with encrea&s;ing energy, triumph in your weak|ne&s;s; try to &s;hake it off, ere the finger of &s;corn and ri|dicule is pointed at you, as the dupe of a deceitful wo|man's art.</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer was inexpre&s;&s;ibly &s;hocked: his pride had frequently repre&s;ented as weakne&s;s the regret he felt for Amanda; and the Earl now &s;timulating that pride, he felt at the moment as if he could make any &s;acrifice which &s;hould prove his having triumphed over his unfortunate attachment; but when his father called upon him to make &s;uch a &s;acrifice, by uniting him&s;elf to Lady Euphra&s;ia, he &s;hrunk back, and acknowledged he could not give &s;o fatal a proof of fortitude. He declared his total repugnance at pre&s;ent to any alliance; time, and the efforts of rea&s;on, he tru&s;ted would &s;ubdue his ill placed attachment, and enable him to comply with the wi&s;hes of his friends.</P>
<P>Lord Cherbury would not, could not drop the &s;ubject next his heart, a &s;ubject &s;o important, &s;o infinitely inte|re&s;ting to him; he exerted all his eloquence, he entreat|ed, he implored his &s;on, not forever to di&s;appoint his wi&s;hes: he mentioned the compliance he had &s;o recently &s;hewn to his, though again&s;t his better judgment, in the u&s;ele&s;s con&s;ent he had given to his marriage with Mi&s;s Fitzalan.</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer, per&s;ecuted by his arguments, at length declared, that was the object he pointed out for his alli|ance, any other than Lady Euphra&s;ia Sutherland, he would not, perhaps, be &s;o reluctant to comply with his wi&s;hes; but &s;he was a woman he could never e&s;teem, and mu&s;t, con&s;equently, for ever refu&s;e; &s;he had given &s;uch &s;pecimens of cruelty and deceit, in the &s;chemes &s;he
<PB N="127" REF="038416_0698_1011E7AF72D4C970">
had entered into with the Marchione&s;s, again&s;t (he blu&s;hed, he faltered, as he pronounced her name) Mi&s;s Fitzalan, that his heart felt unutterable di&s;like to her.</P>
<P>The Earl was prepared for this; he had the barbarity to declare, in the mo&s;t unhe&s;itating manner, he was &s;or|ry &s;till to find him blinded by the art of that wretched girl; he bid him reflect on her conduct, and th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n con|&s;ider whether any credence was to be given on her de|claration, of Belgrave's being admitted to the hou&s;e without her knowledge.</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer was &s;tartled; her conduct, indeed, as his father &s;aid, might well make him doubt her veracity. But &s;till the evidence of the &s;ervants; they acknowledged having been in&s;truments in forwarding the &s;cheme which &s;he &s;aid was laid again&s;t her. He mentioned this cir|cum&s;tance; the Earl was al&s;o prepared for it; the &s;er|vants, he declared, had been examined in his pre&s;ence, when, with &s;hame and contrition they confe&s;t, that &s;ee|ing the &s;trong anxiety of Lord Mortimer for the re&s;to|ration of Mi&s;s Fitzalan's fame, and tempted by the large bribes he offered, if they could or would &s;ay any thing in her ju&s;tification, they had, at la&s;t made the allegati|on &s;o plea&s;ing to him.</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer &s;ighed deeply; on every &s;ide, cried he I find I have been the dupe of art; but it was only the deceit of one could agonize my &s;oul. Still, how|ever, he was inex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rable to all his father could &s;ay, re|lative to Lady Euphra&s;ia.</P>
<P>Lady Martha was at la&s;t brought in as an auxilliary; &s;he was now as &s;trenuous for the connection as ever Lord Cherbury had been; a longer indulgence of Lord Mor|timer's grief, &s;he feared would completely undermine his health, and either render him a burthen to him&s;elf, or precipitate him to an early grave. Whil&s;t he continued &s;ingle, &s;he knew he would not con&s;ider any vigorous exertions for overcoming that grief nece&s;&s;ary; but if once united, &s;he was convinced, from the rectit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">de and &s;en&s;ibility of his di&s;po&s;ition, he would &s;truggle again&s;t his feelings, in order to fulfil the incumbent duties he had impo&s;ed upon him&s;elf. Thus did &s;he deem an union
<PB N="128" REF="038416_0699_1011E7B3527AA2F8">
requi&s;ite to rou&s;e him to exertion, to re&s;tore his peace, and in all probability to &s;ave his life. She joined in her brother's arguments and entreaties, with tears &s;he joined in them, and be&s;ought Mortimer to accede to their wi&s;hes: &s;he called him the la&s;t hope of their hou&s;e; he had long, &s;he &s;aid, been the pride, the delight of their days; their comfort, their exi&s;tence, were inter|woven in his; if he &s;unk, they &s;unk with him.</P>
<P>The yielding &s;oul of Mortimer could not re&s;i&s;t &s;uch tenderne&s;s, and he gave a promi&s;e of acting as they wi&s;hed. He imagined he could not be more wretched; but &s;carcely had this promi&s;e pa&s;t his lips, ere he felt an augmentation of mi&s;ery. To enter into new engage|ments, to re&s;ign the &s;weet, though melancholy privilege of divulging his feelings, to fetter at once both &s;oul and body, were ideas that filled him with unutterable an|gui&s;h. A thou&s;and times was he on the point of re|tracting his regretted and reluctant promi&s;e, had not ho|nour interpo&s;ed, and &s;hewed the inability of doing &s;o, without an infringement on its principles. Thus entan|gled, Mortimer endeavoured to collect his &s;cattered thoughts, and in order to try and gain &s;ome compo&s;ure, he altered his former plan of acting, and mingled as much as po&s;&s;ible in &s;ociety; he &s;trove to fly from him&s;elf, that by &s;o doing he might fly from the corro&s;ive remembrances which embittered his life. But who &s;hall paint his ago|nies at the unexpected &s;ight of Amanda at the Mac|queens. The exertions he had for &s;ome time before com|pelled him&s;elf to make, had a little abated the pain of his feelings, but that pain returned with redoubled vio|lence at her pre&s;ence, and every idea of pre&s;ent compo|&s;ure, or future tranquillity, vani&s;hed. He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">lt, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> re|gret, with angui&s;h, that &s;he was as dear as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to his &s;oul, and his de&s;tined union became more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> than ever to him. He tried, by recollecting her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to awaken his re&s;entment; but alas! &s;oftne&s;s, in &s;pite of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his efforts to the contrary, was the predominant feeling of his &s;oul. Her pallid cheek, her deep dejection, &s;eem|ed to &s;ay &s;he was the child of &s;orrow and repentance. To &s;ooth that &s;orrow, to &s;trengthen tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> repentance, oh!
<PB N="129" REF="038416_0700_1011E7B4E01C98A8">
how delightful unto him; but either he dur&s;t not do, &s;ituated as he then was.</P>
<P>With the utmo&s;t difficulty Lady Martha Dormer prevailed on him to be pre&s;ent, when &s;he demanded the picture from Amanda. That &s;cene has already been de&s;cribed, al&s;o his parting one with her; but to de&s;cribe the angui&s;h he endured after this period, is impo&s;&s;ible. He beheld Lady Euphra&s;ia with a degree of horror; his faltering voice refu&s;ed even to pay her the accu&s;tomed compliments of meeting; he loathed the &s;ociety he met at the ca&s;tle, and regardle&s;s of what might be thought of him; regardle&s;s of health, or the bleakne&s;s of the &s;ea|&s;on, wandered for hours together in the mo&s;t unfrequent|ed parts of the domain, the verye&s;t &s;on of wretchedne&s;s and de&s;pair.</P>
<P>The day, the dreaded day at length arrived, which was to complete his mi&s;ery. The company were all a&s;|&s;embled in the great hall of the Ca&s;tle, from whence they were to proceed to the Chapel and every moment expected the appearance of the bride. The Marquis, &s;urpri&s;ed at her long delay, &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger, to reque&s;t her immediate pre&s;ence, who returned in a few minutes with a letter which he pre&s;ented to the Marquis, who broke the &s;eal in vi&s;ible trepidation, and found it from Lady Euphra&s;ia.</P>
<P>"She had taken a &s;tep," &s;he &s;aid, "which &s;he mu&s;t depend on the kind indulgence of her parents to excu&s;e, a &s;tep which nothing but a firm conviction, that happi|ne&s;s could not be experienced in an union with Lord Mortimer, &s;hould have tempted her to. His uniform indifference had, at la&s;t convinced her, that motives, of the mo&s;t intere&s;ted nature, influenced his addre&s;&s;es to her, and if her parents enquired into his, or at lea&s;t Lord Cherbury's conduct, they would find her a&s;&s;ertion true, and would con&s;equently, &s;he tru&s;ted, excu&s;e her for not &s;ubmitting to be &s;acrificed at the &s;hrine of intere&s;t. In &s;electing Mr. Freelove for her choice, &s;he had &s;elected a man, who&s;e addre&s;&s;es were not prompted by &s;elfi&s;h views, but by a &s;incere affection, which he
<PB N="130" REF="038416_0701_1011E7B7701EEC88">
would openly have avowed, had he not been a&s;&s;ured, in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of affairs, it would have met with oppo&s;ition. To avoid, therefore, a po&s;itive act of di&s;o|bedience, &s;he had con&s;ented to a private union. To Lord Mortimer and Lord Cherbury," &s;he &s;aid, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;he deemed no apology nece&s;&s;ary for her conduct, as their hearts, at lea&s;t Lord Cherbury's, would at once excul|pate her, from his own con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of not having act|ed either generou&s;ly or honourably to her."</P>
<P>The violent tran&s;ports of pa&s;&s;ion the Marquis experi|enced are not to be de&s;cribed. The Marchione&s;s ha&s;ti|ly peru&s;ed the letter, and her feelings were not inferior in violence to his. Its contents were not known, and amazement &s;at on every countenance. But oh! what joy did they in&s;pire in the &s;oul of Lord Mortimer; not a re&s;pite, or rather a full pardon to the condemned wretch, at the very moment when preparing for death, could have yielded more exqui&s;ite delight; but to Lord Cherbury, what a di&s;appointment! it was, indeed a death &s;troke to his hopes; the hints in Lady Euphra|&s;ia's letter concerning him, plainly declared her know|ledge of his conduct; he fore&s;aw an immediate demand from Freelove; fore&s;aw the di&s;grace he &s;hould experi|ence, when his inability to di&s;charge that demand was known. His &s;oul was &s;haken in its utmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es, and the excruciating angui&s;h of his feelings was in|deed as &s;evere a puni&s;hment as he could &s;uffer. Pale, &s;peechle&s;s, agha&s;t, the mo&s;t horrid ideas took po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of his mind; yet he &s;ought not to repel them, for any thing was preferable to the &s;hame he &s;aw awaiting him.</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer's indignation was excited by the a&s;|per&s;ions ca&s;t upon his father, a&s;per&s;ions he imputed en|tirely to the malice of Lady Euphra&s;ia, and which, from the character of Lord Cherbury, he deemed it unnece&s;|&s;ary to attempt refuting. But alas! what a &s;hock did his noble, his un&s;u&s;picious nature receive, when, in a &s;hort time after the peru&s;al of her letter, one from Freelove was brought him, which fully proved the truth of her a&s;&s;ertions. Freelove, in his little trifling manner
<PB N="131" REF="038416_0702_1011E7B90D15B370">
expre&s;&s;ed his hopes that there would be no differ|ence between his Lord&s;hip and him, for whom he ex|pre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t entire frien&s;hip, on account of the fair lady who had honoured him with her regard: de|clared her partiality was quite irre&s;i&s;tible: and moreo|ver, that in love, as in war, every advantage was al|lowable: begged to trouble his Lord&s;hip with his com|pliments to Lord Cherbury, and a reque&s;t that every thing might be prepared to &s;ettle matters between them on his return from his matrimonial expediton. An im|mediate compliance with this reque&s;t, he was convinced, could not be in the lea&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing; and it was ab&s;o|lutely e&s;&s;ential to him, from the eclat with which he de|&s;igned Lady Euphra&s;ia Freelove &s;hould make her bri|dal entry into public. As to the report, he &s;aid, which he had heard relative to Lord Cherbury's lo&s;ing the for|tune which was entru&s;ted to his care for him at the ga|ming table, he quite di&s;believed it.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, the mo&s;t mortifying &s;en&s;ations took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Lord Mortimer at this part of the let|ter; it explained the rea&s;ons of Lord Cherbury's &s;trong anxiety for an alliance with the Ro&s;line family, which Lord Mortimer indeed had often wondered at, and he at once pitied, condemned, and blu&s;hed for him. He &s;tole a glance at his father, and his deep de&s;pairing look filled him with horror. He re&s;olved, the fir&s;t op|portunity, to declare his knowledge of the fatal &s;ecret which oppre&s;&s;ed him, and his re&s;olution of making any &s;acrifice which could po&s;&s;ibly remove or le&s;&s;en his in|quietude.</P>
<P>Lord Cherbury was anxious to fly from the now ha|ted Ca&s;tle, ere farther confu&s;ion overtook him. He mentioned his intention of immediately departing, an intention oppo&s;ed by the Marquis, but in which he was &s;teady, and al&s;o &s;upported by his &s;on.</P>
<P>Every thing was ready for their departure, when Lord Cherbury, overwhelmed by the dreadful agitations he experienced, was &s;eized with a fit of the mo&s;t violent and alarming nature; he was carried to a chamber, and recour&s;e was obliged to be had to a phy&s;ician, ere the
<PB N="132" REF="038416_0703_1011E7BCEE127AB8">
re&s;toration of his &s;en&s;es were effected; but he was then &s;o weak, that the phy&s;ician declared, if not kept quiet, a return of his di&s;order might be expected.</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer, tenderly impatient to lighten the burthen of his father's mind, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the attendants as &s;oon as he po&s;&s;ibly could, and then in the mo&s;t deli|cate terms declared his knowledge of his &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Lord Cherbury at this &s;tarted up in the mo&s;t violent paroxi&s;m of angui&s;h, and vowed he would never &s;urvive the di&s;covery of his being a villain. With difficulty could Lord Mortimer compo&s;e him; but it was long ere he could prevail on him to hear what he wi&s;hed to &s;ay.</P>
<P>Few there were, he &s;aid, who at &s;ome period of their lives, he believed, were not led into actions which upon reflection they had rea&s;on to regret; he thought not, he meant not to &s;peak &s;lightly of human nature, he on|ly wi&s;hed to prove, that liable as we all are to frailty&mdash;a frailty intended no doubt to check the arrogance of pride and pre&s;umption, we &s;hould not &s;uffer the remem|brance of error, when once &s;incerely repented of, to plunge us into de&s;pair, particularly when, as far as in our power, we meant to atone for it."</P>
<P>Thus did Lord Mortimer attempt to calm the dread|ful conflicts of his father's mind, who &s;till continued to inveigh again&s;t him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"The &s;ale of Tudor Hall," Lord Mortimer proceed|ed, "and mortgages upon Lord Cherbury's e&s;tates, would enable his father to di&s;charge his debt to Mr. Freelove. He knew," he &s;aid, "it was tenderne&s;s to him which had prevented him ere this from adopting &s;uch a plan; but he be&s;ought him to let no farther con|&s;ideration on his account make him delay fulfilling im|mediately the claims of honour and ju&s;tice. He be|&s;ought him to believe his tranquillity was more precious to him than any thing in life, that the re&s;toration of his peace was far more e&s;timable to him than the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t brilliant fortune; a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion which," conti|nued Lord Mortimer, deeply &s;ighing, "I am well con|vinced, will not alone yield happine&s;s. I have long," &s;aid he, "looked with an eye of cool indifference on the pomps

At the po&s;t of danger I may perhaps have the happine&s;s of performing &s;ervices for my country, which while loitering &s;upinely in the &s;hade of pro&s;perity I ne|ver could have done. Thus, my dear father," he con|tinued, "you &s;ee how erroneous we are in opinions we often form of things, &s;ince what we often con&s;ider as the bittere&s;t evil leads to the mo&s;t &s;upreme good. We will, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, ha&s;ten every thing to be pre|pared for Freelove, and thus, I make no doubt, di&s;ap|point the little malice of his &s;oul.</P>
<P>"My aunt, my &s;i&s;ter, are unacquainted with your unea&s;ine&s;s, nor &s;hall an intimation of it from me ever tran&s;pire to them: of fortune, &s;ufficient will remain to allow, though not the &s;plendours, the comforts and ele|gancies of life. As for me, the deprivation of what is con&s;idered and fal&s;ely termed my accu&s;tomed indulgen|cies, will be the mo&s;t &s;alutary and efficacious thing that could po&s;&s;ibly happen to me. In &s;hort, I believe that the realization of my plan will render me happy, &s;ince, with truth I can a&s;&s;ure you, its anticipation has already given more plea&s;ure to my &s;oul, than I thought it would ever have again enjoyed."</P>
<P>Lord Cherbury, overcome by the tenderne&s;s, the vir|tue of his &s;on, by the &s;acrifice he &s;o willingly offered, &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted on making, of his paternal for|tune, could not for &s;ome minutes &s;peak. At length the &s;truggling emotions of his &s;oul found utterance.</P>
<P>"Oh! virtue," he exclaimed, while tears of love, of gratitude, of contrition, flowed from his eyes, and fell
<PB N="134" REF="038416_0705_1011E7C280F58390">
upon the hand of his &s;on, cla&s;ped within his, "oh! vir|tue, I cannot &s;ay, like Brutus, thou art but a &s;hade: no, here in this invaluable &s;on thou art per&s;onified&mdash;this &s;on whom I &s;o cruelly deceived, &s;o bitterly di&s;tre&s;t.&mdash;Oh! gracious powers, would not that heroic, that hea|ven born di&s;po&s;ition, which now le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ds him to &s;ign away his paternal fortune for my &s;ake, have al&s;o led him to a &s;till greater re&s;ignation, the &s;acrifice of his Amanda, had I entru&s;ted him with my wretched &s;ituation. Oh! had I confided in him, what an act of ba&s;ene&s;s &s;hould I have avoided? what pangs, what tortures, &s;hould I have prevented his experiencing? but to &s;ave my own guilty confu&s;ion, I drew wretchedne&s;s upon his head, I wrung every fibre of his heart with agony, by making him believe its deare&s;t, its mo&s;t valued object unworthy of its regards."</P>
<P>Mortimer &s;tarted&mdash;he ga&s;ped&mdash;he repeated, in faul|tering accents, the&s;e la&s;t words; his &s;oul &s;eemed as if it would bur&s;t its mortal bounds, and &s;oar to another region, to hear an avowal of his Amanda's purity.</P>
<P>"Oh! Mortimer," cried the Earl, in the deep de&s;|ponding tone of angui&s;h, "how &s;hall I dare to lift my eyes to thine, after the avowal of the inju&s;tice I have done one of the mo&s;t amiable and lovelie&s;t of hu|man beings?"</P>
<P>"Oh! tell me," cried Mortimer, in breathle&s;s, trem|bling agitation, "tell me if indeed &s;he is all my fond heart once believed her to be? in mercy, in pity, delay not to inform me?"</P>
<P>Slowly, in con&s;equence of his weakne&s;s, but with all the willingne&s;s of a contrite &s;pirit, anxious to do ju&s;tice to the injured, did Lord Cherbury reveal all that had pa&s;&s;ed between him and Amanda. "Poor Fitzalan," cried he as he fini&s;hed his relation, "poor, unhappy friend; from thy cold grave could&s;t thou have known the tran&s;actions of this world, how mu&s;t thy good and feeling &s;pirit have reproached me for my barbarity to thy orphan, in robbing her of the only &s;tipend thy ad|ver&s;e fortune had power to leave her&mdash;a pure and &s;pot|le&s;s fame?"</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="038416_0706_1011E7C52F03D7C8">
Lord Mortimer groaned with angui&s;h; every re|proachful word he had uttered to Amanda darted upon his remembrance, and were like &s;o many daggers to his heart. It was his father that oppre&s;&s;ed her; this know|ledge aggravated his feelings, but &s;tifled his reproaches: it was a father, contrite, perhaps at that very mo|ment &s;tretched upon a death bed&mdash;therefore he forgave him.</P>
<P>He ca&s;t his eyes around, as if in that moment he had hoped to behold her, have an opportunity of falling pro&s;|trate at her feet, and imploring her forgivene&s;s: he ca&s;t his eyes around, as if imagining he &s;hould &s;ee her, and be allowed to fold her to his beating heart, and a&s;k her &s;oft voice to pronounce his pardon.</P>
<P>"Oh! thou lovely mourner," he exclaimed to him|&s;elf, while a gu&s;h of &s;orrow bur&s;t from his eyes, "oh! thou lovely mourner, when I cen&s;ured, reviled, upbraid|ed you, even at that very period your heart was &s;uffering the mo&s;t excruciating angui&s;h: Yes, Amanda, he who would willingly have laid down life to yield thee peace, even he was led to aggravate thy woes; with what gen|tlene&s;s, what unexampled patience did&s;t thou bear my reproaches! no &s;udden ray of indignation for purity &s;o in&s;ulted, innocence &s;o arraigned, fla&s;hed from thy eyes; the beams of meekne&s;s and re&s;ignation alone &s;tole from beneath their tearful lids.</P>
<P>"No &s;weet hope of being able to atone, no delight|ful idea of being able to make reparation for my inju&s;|tice, now alleviates the poignancy of my feelings; &s;ince fate interpo&s;ed between us in the hour of pro&s;perity, I cannot, in the bleak and chilling period of adver&s;ity, &s;eek to unite your de&s;tiny with mine, now almo&s;t the child of want my&s;elf, a &s;oldier of fortune, obliged by the &s;word to earn bread, I cannot think of leading you into difficulties and dangers greater than you ever before experienced. Oh! my Amanda, may the calm &s;hade of &s;ecurity be forever thine, thy Mortimer, thy ever faithful, ever adoring Mortimer, will not, from any &s;elfi&s;h con&s;ideration, &s;eek to lead thee from it.

<P>The indulgence of feelings, &s;uch as his language ex|pre&s;&s;ed, he was obliged to forego, in order to fulfil the wi&s;h he felt of alleviating the &s;ituation of his father; but his attention was unable to lighten the angui&s;h which oppre&s;&s;ed the mind of Lord Cherbury; remor&s;e for his pa&s;t conduct, mortification at being le&s;&s;ened in the e&s;tima|tion of his &s;on, &s;orrow for the injury he was compelled to do him, to be extricated from the power of Freelove, all preyed upon his mind, produced the mo&s;t violent agitations, and an alarming repetition of fits.</P>
<P>Things remained in this &s;ituation for a few days, dur|ing which time no intelligence had been received of Euphra&s;ia, when one morning, when Lord Mortimer was &s;itting for a few minutes with the Marquis and Marchione&s;s, a &s;ervant entered the apartment and in|formed his Lord that a gentleman was ju&s;t arrived at the Ca&s;tle, who reque&s;ted to be introduced to his pre|&s;ence. The Marquis and Marchione&s;s in&s;tantly con|cluded this was &s;ome per&s;on &s;ent as an interce&s;&s;or from Lady Euphra&s;ia, and they in&s;tantly admitted him, in order to have an opportunity of a&s;&s;uring her Lady&s;hip, through his means, it mu&s;t be &s;ome time (if indeed at all) ere they could po&s;&s;ibly forgive her di&s;re&s;pect and di&s;obedience.</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer would have retired, but was reque&s;t|ed to &s;tay, and complied, prompted indeed by curio&s;ity to hear what kind of apology or me&s;&s;age lady Euphra&s;ia had &s;ent. A man of a mo&s;t plea&s;ing appearance entered, and was received with the mo&s;t frigid politene&s;s. He looked embarra&s;&s;ed, agitated, even di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. He at|tempted &s;everal times to &s;peak, but the words &s;till died away undi&s;tingui&s;hed. At length the Marchione&s;s, yielding to the natural impetuo&s;ity of her &s;oul, ha&s;tily
<PB N="137" REF="038416_0708_1011E7CAD2C5C940">
de&s;ired he would reveal what had procured them the honour of his vi&s;it.</P>
<P>"A circum&s;tance of the mo&s;t unhappy nature, Ma|dam," he replied, in a he&s;itating voice, "I came with the hope, the expectation of being able to break it by degrees, &s;o as not totally to overpower, but I find my&s;elf unequal to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing ta&s;k."</P>
<P>"I fancy, Sir," cried the Marchione&s;s, "both the Marquis and I are already aware of the circum&s;tance you allude to."</P>
<P>"Alas! Madam," &s;aid the &s;tranger, fixing his eyes with a mournful earne&s;tne&s;s on her face, "I cannot think &s;o; if you were, it would not be in human, in pa|ternal nature to appear as you now do." He &s;topped, he turned pale, he trembled, his emotions became con|tagious.</P>
<P>"Tell me," &s;aid the Marquis, in a voice &s;carcely ar|ticulate, "I be&s;eech you, without delay, the meaning of your words."</P>
<P>The &s;tranger e&s;&s;ayed to &s;peak, but could not; words indeed were &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary to declare that he had &s;omething &s;hocking to reveal. His auditors, like old Northumberland, might have &s;aid, "The palene&s;s on thy cheeks is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand."</P>
<P>"Something dreadful has happened to my child," &s;aid the Marchione&s;s, forgetting at that agonizing mo|ment all di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>"Alas! Madam," cried the &s;tranger, while a trick|ling tear denoted his &s;en&s;ibility for the &s;orrows he was about giving ri&s;e to; "alas! Madam, your fears are too well founded; to torture you with longer &s;u&s;pence would be barbarity. Something dreadful has happened indeed&mdash;Lady Euphra&s;ia in this world will never more be &s;en|&s;ible of your kindne&s;s." A wild, a piercing, agonizing &s;hriek bur&s;t from the lips of the Marchione&s;s as &s;he dropped &s;en&s;ele&s;s from her &s;eat. The Marquis was &s;ink|ing from his had not Lord Mortimer, who &s;at by him, timely &s;tarted up, and though trembling him&s;elf with horror, caught him in his arms.

<PB N="138" REF="038416_0709_1011E7CDD4A73758">
to her chamber, the wretched Marquis reviving in a few minutes, if that could be called reviving, which was on|ly a keener perception of mi&s;ery, demanded, in a tone of angui&s;h, the whole particulars of the &s;ad event; yet &s;carcely had the &s;tranger began to comply with his re|que&s;t, ere with all the wild incon&s;i&s;tency of grief, he bid him to forbear, and, &s;huddering, declared he could not li&s;ten to the dreadful particulars; but it were need|le&s;s, as well as impo&s;&s;ible, to de&s;cribe the feelings of the wretched parents, who in one moment beheld their hopes, their wi&s;hes, their expectations finally de&s;troyed: Oh! what an awful le&s;&s;on did they inculcate of the in&s;tability of human happine&s;s, of the in&s;ufficiency of rank or riches to retain it. This was one of the events which Provi|dence, in its infinite wi&s;dom, makes u&s;e of to arre&s;t the thoughtle&s;s in their career of di&s;&s;ipation, and check the ar|rogance of pride and vanity; when we behold the proud, the wealthy, the illu&s;trious, &s;uddenly &s;urpri&s;ed by calam|ity, and &s;inking beneat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> its &s;troke, we naturally reflect on the frail tenure of earthly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and from the reflection, con&s;ider how we may be&s;t attain that happi|ne&s;s which cannot change; the human heart is in gen|eral &s;o formed as to require &s;omething great to intere&s;t and affect it. Thus a &s;imilar misfortune happening to a per&s;on in a con&s;picuous, and to one in an ob&s;cure &s;itu|ation, would not, in all probability, equally affect or call home the wandering thoughts to &s;adne&s;s and reflec|tion. The humble floweret, trampled to the du&s;t, is pa&s;|&s;ed on with an eye of carele&s;s indifference; but the proud oak, torn from the earth, and levelled by the &s;torm, is viewed with wonder and affright. The hor|rors of the blow, which overwhelmed the Marquis and Marchione&s;s, were augmented by the &s;ecret whi&s;pers of con&s;cience, that &s;eemed to &s;ay it was a blow of retribu|tion, from a Being all righteous, and all ju&s;t, who&s;e mo&s;t &s;acred laws they had violated, in oppre&s;&s;ing the widow and defrauding the orphan.

longer avoid retro&s;pection, a retro&s;pection which height|ened the gloomy horrors of the future. In Lady Eu|phra&s;ia all the hopes, the affections of the Marquis and Marchion&s;s were centered; &s;he alone had ever made them feel the tenderne&s;s of humanity, yet &s;he was not le&s;s the darling of their love, than the idol of their pride; in her they beheld the being who was to &s;upport the honours of their hou&s;e, and tran&s;mit their names to po&s;terity; in her they beheld the being who gave them an opportunity of gratifying the malevolent, as well as tender and ambitious pa&s;&s;ions of their &s;ouls; the next heir to the Marquis's title and fortune had irreconcilably di&s;obliged him, as a means therefore of di&s;appointing him, if on no other account, Lady Euphra&s;ia would have been regarded by them.</P>
<P>Though &s;he had di&s;appointed and di&s;plea&s;ed them by her recent act of di&s;obedience, and though they had deemed it e&s;&s;ential to their con&s;equence to di&s;play that di&s;plea&s;ure, yet they &s;ecretly re&s;olved not long to withhold forgivene&s;s from her, and al&s;o to take imme|diate &s;teps for ennobling Freelove.</P>
<P>For Lady Euphra&s;ia they felt indeed a tenderne&s;s, her heart for them was totally a &s;tranger to; it &s;eemed indeed as if cold and indifferent to all mankind, their af|fections were &s;tronger for being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> one channel; in the &s;tep &s;he had taken, Lady Euphra&s;ia only con&s;ider|ed the gratification of her revenge. Freelove as the ward of Lord Cherbury in honour to him had been invit|ed to the nuptials; he accepted the invitation, but in|&s;tead of accompanying, promi&s;ed to follow the bridal party to the ca&s;tle. A day or two ere he intended &s;et|ting out, by &s;ome accidental chance, he got into compa|ny with the very per&s;on to whom Lord Cherbury had lo&s;t &s;o much, and on who&s;e account he had committed an ac|tion which had entailed the mo&s;t excruciating remor&s;e upon him; this per&s;on was acquainted with the whole tran&s;action; he had promi&s;ed to keep his knowledge &s;ecret but the promi&s;es of the worthle&s;s are of little avail. A &s;light expre&s;&s;ion which in a moment of anxiety, had involuntarily dropped from Lord Cherbury, had &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ung

His unexpectedly meet|ing Freelove afforded him an opportunity of gratifying both the&s;e propen&s;ities, and he &s;crupled not to avail him&s;elf of it. Freelove was a&s;toni&s;hed, and when the fir&s;t violence of a&s;toni&s;hment was over, delighted.</P>
<P>To triumph over the proud &s;oul of Lord Cherbury and his &s;on, was indeed an idea which afforded rapture; both he had ever di&s;liked, the latter particularly: he di&s;liked him from the &s;uperiority which he &s;aw in every re&s;pect he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed over him&s;elf. A &s;tranger to noble emulation, he &s;ought not by &s;tudy or imitation to a&s;pire to any of tho&s;e graces or perfections he beheld in Lord Mortimer, he &s;ought alone to depreciate them, and when he found that impo&s;&s;ible, beheld him with greater envy and malignity than ever. To wound Lord Mor|timer through the bo&s;om of his father, to overwhelm him with confu&s;ion, by publicly di&s;playing the error of that father, were ideas of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite delight&mdash;ideas which the wealth of worlds would &s;carcely have tempted him to forego; &s;o &s;weet is any triumph, however acci|dental or imaginary, over a noble object to an envious mind, which ever hates that excellence it cannot reach. No fear of &s;elf intere&s;t being injured checked his plea|&s;ure; the fortune of Lord Cherbury he knew &s;ufficient to an&s;wer for his violating tru&s;t; thus had he another &s;ource of triumph in the pro&s;pect of having tho&s;e &s;o long con&s;idered as the proud rivals of his wealth and &s;plendor, ca&s;t into the &s;hade: his plea&s;ure, however, from this idea was &s;hort lived, when he reflected that Lord Mortimer's union with Lady Euphra&s;ia, would to|tally exempt him from feeling any inconveniency from his father's conduct: but could not this union be pre|vented? Freelove a&s;ked him&s;elf; he &s;till wanted a &s;hort period of being of age, con&s;equently had no right at pre&s;ent to demand a &s;ettlement of his affairs from Lord Cherbury; he might, however, privately inform La|dy Euphra&s;ia of the affair &s;o recently communicated to him. No &s;ooner did he conceive this &s;cheme, than he
<PB N="141" REF="038416_0712_1011E7D59655D5A0">
glowed with impatience to put it in execution: he ha&s;|tened to the Marquis's, whither indeed he extrava|gant and foppi&s;h preparations he had made for the pro|jected nuptials had before prevented his going, and took the fir&s;t opportunity which offered of revealing to Lady Euphra&s;ia, as if from the pure&s;t friend&s;hip, the conduct of Lord Cherbury and the derangement of his affairs.</P>
<P>Lady Euphra&s;ia was at once &s;urpri&s;ed and incen&s;ed; the rea&s;on for an union between her and his &s;on being &s;o ardently de&s;ired by Lord Cherbury, was now fully ex|plained, and &s;he beheld her&s;elf as an object addre&s;&s;ed merely from a view of repairing a ruined fortune; but this view &s;he re&s;olved to di&s;appoint. Such was the im|placable nature of her di&s;po&s;ition, that had this di&s;ap|pointment occa&s;ioned the de&s;truction of her own peace, it would not have made her relinqui&s;h it, but this was not the ca&s;e; in &s;acrificing all ideas of a union with Lord Mortimer to her offended pride, &s;he &s;acrificed no wi&s;h or inclination of her &s;oul. Lord Mortimer, though the object of her admiration, had never been the ob|ject of her love; &s;he was indeed incapable of feeling that pa&s;&s;ion; her admiration had, however, long &s;ince given place to re&s;entment, at the cool indifference with which he regarded her; &s;he would have oppo&s;ed a mar|riage with him, but for a fear that he might, thus freed, attach him&s;elf to Amanda. The moment, however, &s;he knew an union with her was nece&s;&s;ary for the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of his fortune, fear, with every con&s;ideration which could oppo&s;e it, vani&s;hed before the idea of di&s;|appointing his views and retaliating upon him that un|ea&s;ine&s;s he had, from wounded pride, made her expe|rience by his cold and unaltered behaviour to her.</P>
<P>She at fir&s;t determined to acquaint the Marquis of what &s;he had heard, but a little reflection made her drop this determination. He had always profe&s;&s;ed a warm re|gard for Lord Cherbury, and &s;he feared that regard would &s;till lead him to in&s;i&s;t on the nuptials taking place; &s;he was not long in concerting a &s;cheme to render &s;uch a mea&s;ure impracticable, and Freelove &s;he re&s;olved to make

Her broken &s;entences, her looks, her affected confu&s;ion, all revealed to Freelove that he was that ob|ject; the rapture this di&s;covery in&s;pired he could not conceal; the flattering expre&s;&s;ions of Lady Euphra&s;ia were rapid by the mo&s;t extravagant compliments, the warme&s;t profe&s;&s;ions, the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urances of never dying love; this &s;oon led to what &s;he de&s;ired, and in a &s;hort &s;pace an elopement was agreed to, and every thing relative to it &s;ettled.&mdash;Freelove's own &s;ervants and equipage were at the Ca&s;tle, and con&s;equently but little difficulty attended the arrangement of their plan. In Lady Euphra&s;ia's eyes Freelove had no other value than what he now merely derived from being an in&s;tru|ment in gratifying the haughty and revengeful pa&s;&s;ions of her nature. She regarded him indeed with &s;ove|reign contempt; his fortune, however, &s;he knew would give him con&s;equence in the world, and &s;he was con|vinced &s;he &s;hould find him quite that ea&s;y convenient hu&s;band, which a woman of fa&s;hion finds &s;o nece&s;&s;ary: in &s;hort, &s;he looked forward to being the uncontrouled mi&s;tre&s;s of her own actions, and without a doubt but that &s;he &s;hould meet many objects as de&s;erving her ad|miration, and infinitely more grateful for it than ever Lord Mortimer had been.</P>
<P>Flu&s;hed with &s;uch plea&s;ing pro&s;pects, &s;he quitted the Ca&s;tle&mdash;that Ca&s;tle &s;he was de&s;tined never more to &s;ee; at the moment, the very moment &s;he &s;miled with joy and expectation, the &s;haft, the unerring &s;haft was rai&s;|ed again&s;t her brea&s;t.</P>

The night was dark and dreary, the road rugged and dangerous, the po&s;til|lions ventured to &s;ay, it would be better to halt for the night, but this was oppo&s;ed by Lady Euphra&s;ia. They were within a few miles of the de&s;tined termination of their journey, and pur&s;uant to her commands they pro|ceeded.

In a few minutes after this the hor&s;es, &s;tartled by a &s;udden light which gleamed acro&s;s the path, began plunging in the mo&s;t alarming manner. A frightful precipice lay on one &s;ide, and the hor&s;es, in &s;pite of all the efforts of the po&s;tillions, continued to approach it. Freelove, in this dreadful moment, lo&s;t all con&s;idera|tion but for him&s;elf&mdash;he bur&s;t open the chariot door, and leaped into the road. His companion was unable to follow his example; &s;he had fainted at the fir&s;t inti|mation of danger. The po&s;tillions with difficulty di&s;|mounted; the other &s;ervants came to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and endeavoured to re&s;train the hor&s;es: every effort was u&s;ele&s;s, they broke from their hold, and plunged down the precipice. The &s;ervants had heard the chariot door open, they therefore concluded, for it was too dark to &s;ee, that both their ma&s;ter and Lady Euphra&s;ia were &s;afe. But who can de&s;cribe their horror, when a loud &s;hriek from him declared her &s;ituation. Some of them immediately ha&s;tened, as fa&s;t as their trembling limbs could carry them, to the hou&s;e adjoining the road, from whence the fatal light had gleamed, which cau&s;ed the &s;ad cata&s;trophe; they revealed it in a few words, and implored immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e was a man of the greate&s;t humanity, he was inexpre&s;&s;i|bly &s;hocked at what he had heard, and joined him&s;elf in giving the a&s;&s;i&s;tance that was de&s;ired.</P>
<P>With lanthorns they proceeded down a winding path, cut in the precipice, and &s;oon di&s;covered the objects of their &s;earch. The hor&s;es were already dead, the cha|riot was &s;hattered to pieces; they took up &s;ome of the fragments and di&s;covered beneath them the lifele&s;s bo|dy of the unfortunate Lady Euphra&s;ia.</P>
<P>The &s;tranger bur&s;t into tears at a &s;ight of &s;o much horror, and in a voice &s;carcely audable, gave orders for her being conveyed to his hou&s;e; but when a bet|ter light gave a more perfect view of the mangled re|mains, all acknowledged that, &s;ince &s;o fatal an acci|dent had befallen her, Heaven was merciful in taking a life, who&s;e continuance would have made her endure the mo&s;t excruciating tortures.</P>

Freelove was now enquired for; he had fainted on the road, but in a few minutes after he was brought in, re|covered his &s;en&s;es, and the fir&s;t u&s;e he made of them was to enquire whether he was dead or alive; upon re|ceiving the comfortable a&s;&s;urance of the latter, he con|gratulated him&s;elf in a manner &s;o warm, upon his e&s;cape, as plainly proved &s;elf was his whole and &s;ole con&s;idera|tion. No great preparations, on account of his feel|ings, was requi&s;ite to inform him of the fate of Lady Euphra&s;ia; he &s;hook his head on hearing it; &s;aid it was what he already gue&s;&s;ed, from the devili&s;h plunge of the hor&s;es; declared it was a mo&s;t unfortunate affair, and expre&s;&s;ed a kind of terror <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> what the Marquis might &s;ay to it, as if he could have been accu&s;ed of be|ing acce&s;&s;ary to it.</P>
<P>Mr. Murry, the gentleman who&s;e hou&s;e had received him, offered to undertake the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing ta&s;k of break|ing the affair to Lady Euphra&s;ias family, an offer Free|love gladly accepted, declaring he felt him&s;elf too much di&s;ordered in mind and body to be able to give any di|rections relative to what was nece&s;&s;ary to be done.</P>
<P>How Mr. Murry executed his ta&s;k is already known; but it was long ere the emotions of the Marquis would &s;uffer him to &s;ay, he wi&s;hed the remains of Lady Eu|phra&s;ia to be brought to the Ca&s;tle, that all the honours due to her birth &s;hould be paid them. This was ac|cordingly done, and the Ca&s;tle, &s;o lately ornamented for her nuptials, was hung with black, and all the pa|geantries of death.</P>
<P>The Marquis and Marchione&s;s confined them&s;elves, in the deepe&s;t angui&s;h, to their apartments: their do|me&s;tics, filled with terror and amazement, glided about like pale &s;pectres, and all was a &s;cene of &s;olemnity and &s;adne&s;s.</P>
<P>Every moment Lord Mortimer could &s;pare from his father he devoted to the Marquis. Lady Euphra&s;ia had ever been an object of indifference, nay, of di&s;like to him; but the manner of her death, notwith&s;tanding, &s;hocked him to the &s;oul; his di&s;like was forgotten; he thought of her only with pity and compa&s;&s;ion, and the
<PB N="145" REF="038416_0716_1011E7E14819F1B0">
tears he mingled with the Marquis were the tears of unfeigned &s;ympathy and regret.</P>
<P>Lady Martha and Lady Araminta were equally at|tentive to the Marchione&s;s; the time not &s;pent with Lord Cherbury was devoted to her. They u&s;ed not un|availing arguments to conquer a grief which nature as her rightful tribute demands; but they &s;oothed that grief by &s;hewing they &s;incerely mourned its &s;ource.</P>
<P>Lord Cherbury had but &s;hort intervals of rea&s;on; tho&s;e intervals were employed by Lord Mortimer in trying to compo&s;e his mind, and by him in ble&s;&s;ing his &s;on for tho&s;e endeavours, and congratulating him&s;elf on the pro&s;pect of approaching di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>His words unutterably affected Lord Mortimer, he had rea&s;on to believe they were dictated by a prophetic &s;pirit; and the di&s;mal peal which rung from morning till night for Lady Euphra&s;ia, &s;ounded in his ear as the knell of his expiring father.</P>
<P>Things were in this &s;ituation in the Ca&s;tle, when O&s;|car and his friend, Sir Charles Bingley, arrived at it, and without &s;ending in their names, reque&s;ted immedi|ate permi&s;&s;ion to the Marquis's pre&s;ence, upon bu&s;ine&s;s of importance.</P>
<P>Their reque&s;t was complied with, from an idea that they came from Freelove, to whom the Marquis and Marchione&s;s, from re&s;pect and affection to the me|mory of their daughter, had determined to pay every attention.</P>
<P>The Marquis knew and was per&s;onally known to Sir Charles; he was infinitely &s;urpri&s;ed by his appearance; but how much was that &s;urpri&s;e increa&s;ed, when Sir Charles, taking O&s;car by the hand, pre&s;ented him to the Marquis as the &s;on of Lady Fitzalan, the rightful heir of the Earl of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>The Marquis was confounded&mdash;he trembled at th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e words: and his confu&s;ion, had &s;uch a te&s;timony been wanting, would have been &s;ufficient to prove his guilt.</P>
<P>He at la&s;t, though with a faultering voice, de&s;ired to know by what means Sir Charles could ju&s;tify or &s;up|port his a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="038416_0717_1011E7E3F146B730">
Sir Charles, for O&s;car was too much agitated to &s;peak, as briefly as po&s;&s;ible related all the particulars which had led to the di&s;covery of the Earl's will; and his friend, he added, with the genero&s;ity of a noble mind, wi&s;hed as much as po&s;&s;ible to &s;pare the feelings and &s;ave the honour of tho&s;e with whom he was con|nected; with which nothing but a he&s;itation in com|plying with his ju&s;t, and well &s;upported claim, could de&s;troy.</P>
<P>The Marquis's agitation increa&s;ed; already was he &s;tript of happine&s;s, and he now &s;aw him&s;elf on the point of being &s;tripped of honour. An hour before he had imagined his wretchedne&s;s could not be augmented; he was now convinced human mi&s;ery cannot be complete without the lo&s;s of reputation. In the idea of being e&s;|teemed, of being thought unde&s;erving our misfortunes, there is a &s;weet, a &s;ecret balm, which meliorates the greate&s;t &s;orrow. Of riches, in his own right, the Mar|quis ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more than &s;ufficient for all his ex|pences; tho&s;e expences would now, comparatively &s;peak|ing, be reduced within very narrow bounds; for the vain pride-which had led him to delight in pomp and often|tation, died with Lady <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. Since therefore of his fortune &s;uch a &s;uper abundance would remain, it was unnece&s;&s;ary as well as unju&s;t, to detain what he had no preten&s;ions to: but he feared tamely acquie&s;cing to this unexpected claim, would be to acknowledge him&s;elf a villain: 'tis true, indeed&punc; that his newly felt remor&s;e had in&s;pired him with a wi&s;h of making reparation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> for his pa&s;t inju&s;tice: but fal&s;e &s;hame &s;tarting up, hitherto op|po&s;ed it&punc; and even now, when an opportunity offered of accompli&s;hing his wi&s;h, &s;till continued to oppo&s;e it, le&s;t the &s;corn and contempt he dreaded &s;hould at length be his portion for his long inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Irre&s;olute how to act, he &s;at for &s;ome time &s;ilent and embarra&s;&s;ed, till at la&s;t recollecting his manner was probably betraying what he wi&s;hed to conceal, namely, his knowledge of the will, he &s;aid, with &s;ome &s;ternne&s;s, "that till he in&s;pected into the affair, &s;o recently laid before him, he could not, nor was it to be expected he

&s;hould, &s;ay how he would act: an in&s;pection which, under the melancholy circum&s;tances he then laboured, he could not pa&s;&s;ibly make for &s;ome &punc;time Had Mr. Fitzalan," he added, "po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in reality that genero|&s;ity Sir Charles's partiality a&s;cribed to him, he would not at a period &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing have appeared to make &s;uch a claim. To delicacy and &s;en&s;ibility the privileges of grief were ever held &s;acred; tho&s;e privileges they had both violated; they had intruded on his &s;orrows; they had even in&s;ulted him, by appearing on &s;uch a bu&s;ine&s;s before him, ere the la&s;t rites were paid to his lamented child."</P>
<P>Sir Charles and O&s;car were inexpre&s;&s;ibly &s;hocked; both were totally ignorant of the recent event.</P>
<P>O&s;car, as he recovered from the &s;urpri&s;e the Marquis's words had given him, declared, in the impa&s;&s;ioned lan|guage of a noble mind, hurt by being thought de&s;titute of &s;en&s;ibility, "that the Marquis had arraigned him un|ju&s;tly; had he known of his &s;orrows," he &s;aid, "nothing &s;hould have tempted him to intrude upon them: he mourned, he re&s;pected them: he be&s;ought him to believe him &s;incere in what he uttered." A tear, an involunta|ry tear, as he &s;poke, &s;tarted into his eye, and trickling down his cheek, denoted his &s;incerity.</P>
<P>The Marquis's heart &s;mote him as he beheld this tear; it reproached him more than the keene&s;t words could have done, and operated more in O&s;car's favour than any arguments, however eloquent.</P>
<P>Had this young man, thought he&punc; been really illibe|ral when I reproached him for want of &s;en&s;ibility, how well might he have retaliated upon me my more fla|grant want of ju&s;tice and humanity; but no, he &s;ees I am a &s;on of &s;orrow, and he will not break the reed which Heaven had already &s;mitten.</P>
<P>Tears gu&s;hed from his eyes: he involuntarily extend|ed his hand to O&s;car; "I &s;ee," &s;aid he, "I &s;ee indeed, I have unju&s;tly arraigned you, but I will endeavour to atone for my error; at pre&s;ent re&s;t &s;atisfied with an a&s;|&s;urance, that whatever is equitable &s;hall be done, and that, let events turn out as they may, I &s;hall ever feel

my&s;elf your friend." O&s;car again expre&s;&s;ed his regret for having waited on him at &s;uch a period, and reque&s;t|ed he would di&s;mi&s;s for the pre&s;ent the &s;ubject they had been talking of from his mind; the Marquis &s;till more plea&s;ed with his manner, de&s;ired his direction, and a&s;|&s;ured him he &s;hould hear from him &s;ooner than he expected.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they retired his agitation decrea&s;ed, and of cour&s;e he was better qualified to con&s;ider how he &s;hould act; that re&s;titution his con&s;cience prompted, but his fal&s;e ideas of &s;hame had prevented, he now found he &s;hould be compelled to make; how to make it therefore, &s;o as to avoid total di&s;grace, was what he con&s;idered. At la&s;t he adopted a &s;cheme, which the &s;en&s;ibility of O&s;car, he flattered him&s;elf, would enable him to accompli&s;h: this was to declare, that by the Earl of Dunreath's will Mr. Fitzalan was heir to his e&s;tates, in ca&s;e of the death of Lady Euphra&s;ia; that in con&s;equence therefore of this event he had come to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them; that Lady Dunreath (who&s;e re&s;idence at Dunreath Abbey he could not now hope to conceal) was but lately returned from a convent in France, where for many years &s;he has re&s;ided. To O&s;car he intended &s;aying, from her ill con|duct he and the Marchione&s;s had been tempted to &s;eque&s;|ter her from the world, in order to &s;ave her from open &s;hame and deri&s;ion; and that her declaration of a will they had always believed the mere fabrication of her brain, in order, as he &s;uppo&s;ed, to give them unea&s;ine&s;s. This &s;cheme once formed, his heart felt a little relieved of the heavy burthen of fear and inquietude. He re|paired to the Marchione&s;s's apartment, and broke the af|fair gently to her, adding at the &s;ame time, that &s;en&s;ible as they now mu&s;t be of the vanities and pur&s;uits of hu|man life, it was time for them to endeavour to make their peace with heaven. Affliction had taught penitence to the Marchione&s;s, as well as to her hu&s;band; &s;he ap|proved of his &s;cheme, and thought with him, that the &s;ooner their intention of making re&s;titution was known, the greater would be the probability of its being accom|pli&s;hed. O&s;car, therefore, the next day received a letter
<PB N="149" REF="038416_0720_1011E7EB835D5018">
from the Marquis, &s;pecifying at once his intention and his wi&s;hes. With tho&s;e wi&s;hes O&s;car generou&s;ly com|plied: his noble &s;oul was &s;uperior to a triumph over a fallen enemy; and he had always wi&s;hed rather to &s;ave from, than expo&s;e the Marquis to di&s;grace; he ha&s;tened as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible to the ca&s;tle, agreeable to a reque&s;t contained in the letter, to a&s;&s;ure the Marquis his conduct throughout the whole affair &s;hould be regulated accord|ing to his de&s;ire.</P>
<P>Perhaps at this moment public contempt could not have humbled the Marquis more than &s;uch genero&s;ity, when he drew a compari&s;on between him&s;elf and the per&s;on the had &s;o long injured; the &s;triking contra&s;t wounded his very &s;oul, and he groaned at the degrada|tion he &s;uffered in his own eyes. He told O&s;car, as &s;oon as the la&s;t &s;ad duties were performed to his daughter, he would &s;ettle every thing with him, and then perhaps be able to introduce him to the Marchione&s;s. He de&s;ired he might take up his re&s;idence in the Ca&s;tle, and expre&s;|&s;ed a wi&s;h that he would attend the funeral of Lady Eu|phra&s;ia as one of the chief mourners. O&s;car declined the former; but promi&s;ed, with a faltering voice, to com|ply with the latter reque&s;t. He then retired, and the Marquis, who had been rou&s;ed from the indulgence of his grief by a wi&s;h of pre&s;erving his character, again re|lap&s;ed into its wretchedne&s;s. He de&s;ired O&s;car to make no &s;ecret of his now being heir to the Earl of Dunreath, and &s;aid he would mention it him&s;elf in his family; through this medium therefore did this &s;urpri&s;ing in|telligence reach Lord Mortimer, and his heart dilated with &s;udden joy at the idea of his Amanda and her brother at la&s;t enjoying independence and pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>In a few hours after this the &s;ufferings of Lord Cher|bury were terminated; his la&s;t faltering accents pro|nounced ble&s;&s;ings on his &s;on. Oh! how &s;weet were the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings&mdash;how different were the feelings of Lord Mor|timer from the callous &s;ons of di&s;&s;ipation, who &s;eem to watch with impatience the la&s;t &s;truggles of a parent, that they may have more exten&s;ive means of gratifying their inordinate de&s;ires. The feelings of Lord Mortimer
<PB N="150" REF="038416_0721_1011E7EE9C42BDC0">
were &s;oothed, by reflecting that he had done every thing in his power for re&s;toring the tranquillity of his father, and his regret was le&s;&s;ened by the conviction that Lord Cherbury, after the di&s;covery of his conduct, could never more in this life have experienced happi|ne&s;s; he therefore, with tender piety, re&s;igned him to his God, humbly tru&s;ting that his penitence had at|toned for his frailties, and in&s;ured him felicity.</P>
<P>He now bid adieu to the ca&s;tle and its wretched own|ers, and accompanied Lady Martha and his &s;i&s;ter to Thornbury, at which the burying place of the family lay. Here he continued till the remains of his father arrived, and were interred; he then proceeded to London, to put into execution the plan he had projected for his father: He immediately adverti&s;ed the Tudor e&s;tate; a &s;tep of this kind could not be concealed from Lady Martha; but the mortgages on the other e&s;tates he re&s;olved care|fully to guard from her knowledge, le&s;t &s;u&s;picions, pre|judicial to the memory of his father would ari&s;e in her mind; but during this period the idea of Amanda was not ab&s;ent from his &s;oul: neither grief nor bu&s;ine&s;s could bani&s;h it a moment, and again a thou&s;and fond and flat|tering hopes concerning her had revived, when a &s;udden blow di&s;per&s;ed them all, and plunged him, if po&s;&s;ible, in greater wretchedne&s;s than he had ever before experienc|ed. He heard it confidently reported, that the Earl of Dunreath's &s;i&s;ter (for O&s;car had by this time claimed, and been allowed to take the title of his grandfather) was to be married to Sir Charles Bingley; the friend|&s;hip which he knew &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the Earl and Sir Charles rendered this too probable; but if a doubt con|cerning it &s;till lingered in his mind, it was de&s;troyed, when Sir Charles waited on him to treat about the pur|cha&s;e of Tudor Hall, it in&s;tantly occurring that this pur|cha&s;e was made by the de&s;ire of Amanda. Unable to command his feelings, he re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed Sir Charles to his agent, and abruptly retired. He called her cruel and ungrateful; after all his &s;ufferings on her account, did he de&s;erve &s;o &s;oon to be bani&s;hed her remembrance, &s;o &s;oon &s;upplanted in her affections by another, by one too

who never had, who never would have an opportunity of giving &s;uch proofs as he had done of con&s;tancy and love? She is lo&s;t then, he &s;ighed! &s;he is lo&s;t for ever! Oh! what avails the vindication of her fame? Is it not an augmentation of my mi&s;ery? Oh! my father, of what a trea&s;ure did you de&s;poil me? but let me not di&s;turb the &s;acred a&s;hes of the dead&mdash;re&s;t&mdash;re&s;t&mdash;in peace&mdash;thou venerable author of my being, and may the involuntary expre&s;&s;ions of heart rending angui&s;h be forgiven! Amanda, then, he continued, after a pau&s;e, will indeed be mi&s;tre&s;s of Tudor Hall; but never will a &s;igh for him who once was its owner heave her bo|&s;om; &s;he will wander beneath tho&s;e &s;hades, where &s;o often &s;he has heard my vows of unalterable love&mdash;vows, which alas! my heart has too fully ob&s;erved, and li&s;|ten to &s;imilar ones from Sir Charles; well, this is the la&s;t &s;troke fate can level at my peace.</P>
<P>Lord Mortimer (or as in future we mu&s;t &s;tile him, Lord Cherbury) had indeed imagined that the affecti|ons of Amanda, like his own, were unalterable; he had therefore indulged the rapturous idea, that, by again &s;eeking an union with her, he &s;hould promote the hap|pine&s;s of both. It is true, he knew &s;he would po&s;&s;e&s;s a fortune infinitely &s;uperior to what he had now a right to expect; but after the proofs he had given of di&s;in|tere&s;ted attachment, not only &s;he, but the world, he was convinced, would acquit him of any &s;elfi&s;h motives in the renewal of his addre&s;&s;es. His hopes de&s;troyed, his pro&s;pects bla&s;ted, by what he heard, he re&s;olved as &s;oon as his affairs were &s;ettled, to go abroad. The death of his father had rendered his entering the army unnece&s;&s;ary, and his &s;pirits were too much broken, his health too much impaired, for him voluntarily now to embrace that de&s;tiny.</P>
<P>On the purcha&s;e of Tudor-Hall being completed by Sir Charles, it was nece&s;&s;ary for Lord Cherbury to &s;ee his &s;teward; he preferred going to &s;ending for him, prompted indeed by a melancholy wi&s;h of paying a la&s;t vi&s;it to Tudor-Hall, endeared to his heart by a thou&s;and fond remembrances. On his arrival he took up his abode
<PB N="152" REF="038416_0723_1011E7F45272B3B8">
at the &s;teward's for a day or two, after a &s;trict injunc|tion to him of concealing his being there; it was after a ramble through every &s;pot about the deme&s;ne, which he had ever trodden with Amanda, that he repaired to the library and di&s;covered her; he was ignorant of her being in the country.&mdash;Oh! then, how great was his &s;urpri&s;e&mdash;how exqui&s;ite his emotions at her unexpect|ed &s;ight!</P>
<P>"I &s;hall not attempt to go over the &s;cene I have al|ready tried to de&s;cribe; &s;uffice it to &s;ay, that the de&s;ire &s;he betrayed of ha&s;tening from him he imputed to the alteration of her &s;entiments with re&s;pect to him and Sir Charles; when undeceived in this re&s;pect, his rapture was as great as ever it had before been at the idea of her love, and like Amanda, he declared his &s;ufferings were now amply rewarded."</P>

<P>BUT, my love, cried Lord Cherbury, as he wiped away the tears which pity and horror at the fate of Lady Euphra&s;ia had cau&s;ed Amanda to &s;hed. "Will your brother think you &s;anction our happine&s;s? will he, who might a&s;pire &s;o high for a &s;i&s;ter, thus at once po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of beauty and fortune, be&s;tow her on one who&s;e title may now almo&s;t be con&s;idered as an empty one?"</P>
<P>"Oh! do not wrong his noble nature by &s;uch a doubt," exclaimed Amanda, "Yes, with pride, with plea&s;ure, with delight, will he be&s;tow his &s;i&s;ter upon the e&s;teemed, the beloved of her heart; upon him who, unwarped by narrow prejudice or &s;elfi&s;h intere&s;t, fought her in the low

&s;hade of ob&s;curity, to lay all friendle&s;s and forlorn as &s;he was, his fortune at her feet.</P>
<P>"Could he indeed be ungrateful to &s;uch kindne&s;s; could he attempt to influence me to another choice, my heart would at once repul&s;e the effort, and avow its fix|ed determination: but he is incapable of &s;uch conduct; my O&s;car is all that is generous and feeling: need I &s;ay more, than that a &s;pirit congenial to your's animates his brea&s;t."</P>
<P>Lord Cherbury cla&s;ped her to his heart; "Deare&s;t, lovelie&s;t of human beings," he exclaimed, "&s;hall I at length call you mine? After all my &s;orrows, my diffi|culties, &s;hall I indeed receive &s;o precious a reward? Oh! wonder not, my Amanda, if I doubt the reality of &s;o &s;udden a rever&s;e of &s;ituation; I feel as if under the in|fluence of a happy dream; but good Heaven! a dream from which I &s;hould never wi&s;h to be awakened."</P>
<P>Amanda now recollected, that if &s;he &s;taid much lon|ger from the cottage &s;he &s;hould have &s;ome one coming in que&s;t of her; &s;he informed Lord Cherbury of this, and ro&s;e to depart, but he would not &s;uffer her to de|part alone, neither did &s;he de&s;ire it.</P>
<P>The nur&s;e and her daughter Bet&s;y were in the cottage at her return to it: to de&s;cribe the &s;urpri&s;e of the for|mer at the appearance of Lord Cherbury is impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;a &s;urpri&s;e mingled with indignation, at the idea of his fal&s;hood to her darling child; but when undeceived in that re&s;pect, her tran&s;ports were of the mo&s;t extrava|gant nature.</P>
<P>"Well, &s;he thanked Heaven," &s;he &s;aid, "&s;he &s;hould now &s;ee her tear chilt hold up her head again, and look as hand&s;ome as ever. Aye, &s;he had always doubted," &s;he &s;aid, "that his Lord&s;hip was not one of the fal&s;e-hearted men &s;he had &s;o often heard her old grandmother talk of."</P>
<P>"My good nur&s;e," &s;aid Lord Cherbury, &s;miling, "you will then give me your dear child with all your heart?"</P>
<P>"Aye, that I will, my Lord," &s;he replied, "and this very moment too, if I could."</P>
<P><PB N="154" REF="038416_0725_1011E7FB79533B60">
"<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">," cried Amanda, "his lord&s;hip will be &s;a|tisfied <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> pre&s;ent with getting his dinner from you."</P>
<P>She then de&s;ired the things to be brought to the little arbour, already de&s;cribed in the beginning of this book and proceeded to it with Lord Cherbury.</P>
<P>The mention of dinner threw nur&s;e and her daugh|ter into univer&s;al commotion.</P>
<P>"Goodlack! how unfortunate it was &s;he had nothing hot or nice to lay pefore his Lord&s;hip; how could &s;he think he could dine upon cold lamb and &s;allad. Well, this was all Mi&s;s Amanda's fault, who would never let her do as &s;he wi&s;hed."</P>
<P>With the utmo&s;t difficulty &s;he was per&s;uaded he could dine upon the&s;e things. The cloth was laid up|on the flowery turf, beneath the &s;preading branches of the arbour. The delicacies of the dairy were added to their repa&s;t, and Bet&s;y provided a de&s;ert of new fil|berts.</P>
<P>Never had Lord Cherbury partaken of &s;o delicious a meal; never had he and Amanda experienced &s;uch hap|pine&s;s&mdash;a happine&s;s derived from what might be termed the &s;ober certainty of waking bli&s;s. The plea&s;ure, the tenderne&s;s of their &s;ouls, beamed in expre&s;&s;ive glances from their eyes, and they were now more convinced than ever, that the humble &s;cenes of life were be&s;t cal|culated for the promotion of felicity.</P>
<P>Lord Cherbury felt more reconciled than he had done before to the diminution of his fortune; he yet retain|ed &s;ufficient for the comforts and many of the elegan|cies of life; the &s;plendor he lo&s;t was in&s;ignificant in his eyes; his pre&s;ent &s;ituation proved happine&s;s could be enjoyed without it, and he knew it equally di&s;re|garded by his Amanda. He a&s;ked him&s;elf,
<Q><L>What was the world to them,</L>
<L>Its pomps, its plea&s;ures, and its non&s;en&s;e all,</L>
<L>Who in each other cla&s;p, whatever fair</L>
<L>High fancy forms, or lavi&s;h hearts can wi&s;h.</L></Q>
All nature looked gay and &s;miling around him; he in|haled the balmy breath of opening flowers, and through
<PB N="155" REF="038416_0726_1011E7FD18224C88">
the verdant canopy he &s;at beneath, he &s;aw the bright a|zure of the heavens, and felt the benignant influence of the &s;un, who&s;e potent beams heightened to glowing luxuriance the beauties of the &s;urrounding land&s;cape. He expre&s;&s;ed his feelings to Amanda; he heard her declare the &s;imilarity of her's; heard her, with all the &s;weet enthu&s;ia&s;m of a refined and animated mind, ex|patiate on the lovely &s;cene around them. Oh! what tender remembrances did it awaken, and what delight|ful plans of felicity did they &s;ketch. Lord Cher|bury would hear from Amanda all &s;he had &s;uffered &s;ince their &s;eparation; and could his love and e&s;teem have been increa&s;ed, her patient endurance of the &s;orrows &s;he related would have increa&s;ed them.</P>
<P>They did not leave the garden till a du&s;ky hue had over&s;pread the land&s;cape. Oh! with what emotions did Amanda watch the &s;etting &s;un, who&s;e ri&s;ing beams &s;he had beheld with eyes ob&s;cured by tears of &s;orrow.</P>
<P>As they &s;at at tea in the room, &s;he could not avoid noticing the alteration in the nurse's dre&s;s, who attend|ed; &s;he had put on all her holiday finery, and to evince her wi&s;h of amu&s;ing her gue&s;ts, had &s;ent for the blind harper, whom &s;he &s;tationed out&s;ide the cottage. His mu&s;ic drew a number of the neighbouring cottagers a|bout him, and they would &s;oon have led up a dance in the vale, had not the nur&s;e prevented them, le&s;t they &s;hould di&s;turb her gue&s;ts. Lord Cherbury, however, in&s;i&s;ted on their being gratified, and &s;ending for his &s;er|vant, ordered him to provide refre&s;hments for them, and to reward the harper.</P>
<P>He would not leave Amanda till he had her permi&s;&s;ion to come the next morning, as &s;oon as he could hope to &s;ee her; accordingly the fir&s;t voice &s;he heard on ri&s;ing was his chatting to the nur&s;e. We may believe &s;he did not &s;pend many minutes at her toilet: the neat &s;impli|city of her dre&s;s, indeed, never required &s;he &s;hould do &s;o, and in a very &s;hort time &s;he joined him. They walked out till breakfa&s;t was ready.
<Q><L>Together trod the morning dews, and gather'd</L>
<L>In their prime fre&s;h blooming &s;weets.</L></Q>
<PB N="156" REF="038416_0727_1011E801272C7140">
Amanda, in hourly expectation of her brother's arrival wi&s;hed ere he came, to inform the inhabitants of the cottage of the alteration in his fortune. This, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Lord Cherbury, &s;he took an opportunity of doing in the cour&s;e of the day to the nur&s;e. Had &s;he been &s;ole relator, &s;he feared &s;he &s;hould have been over|whelmed with que&s;tions. Joy and wonder were excited in an extreme degree by this relation, and nothing but the nurse's hurry and impatience to communicate it to her family, could have prevented her from a&s;king again and again a repetition of it.</P>
<P>Lord Cherbury now, as on the foregoing day, dined with Amanda; her expectations relative to the &s;peedy arrival of her brother were not di&s;appointed. While &s;it|ting after dinner with Lord Cherbury in the garden, the nur&s;e, half breathle&s;s, came running to tell them, that a &s;uperb coach and four, which to be &s;ure mu&s;t be Lort Dunreath's was coming down the road.</P>
<P>Lord Cherbury coloured with emotion. Amanda did not wi&s;h he and her brother &s;hould meet till &s;he had ex|plained every thing relative to him. By her de&s;ire he retired to the valley, to which a winding path from the garden de&s;cended, whil&s;t &s;he hurried to the cottage to receive and welcome her beloved brother: their meeting was at once tender and affecting, the faithful Edwins &s;urrounded O&s;car with delight and rapture, pouring forth, in their &s;imple &s;tile, congratulations on his happy fortune, and their wi&s;hes for his long enjoying it. He thanked them with a &s;tarting tear of &s;en&s;ibility; he a&s;|&s;ured them that their attentions to his dear &s;i&s;ter, his la|mented parents, his infant years, entitled them to his la&s;t|ing gratitude. As &s;oon as he and Amanda could di&s;|engage them&s;elves from the good creatures, without wounding their feelings, they retired to her room, where O&s;car related, as we have already done, all that pa&s;&s;ed between him and the Marquis of Ro&s;line.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the funeral of Lady Euphra&s;ia was over, the Marquis, according to his promi&s;e, lettled every thing with him, and put him into formal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Dunreath Abbey. By the Marquis's de&s;ire he then
<PB N="157" REF="038416_0728_1011E802B57881D0">
waited upon Lady Dunreath to inform her &s;he was at liberty, and to reque&s;t &s;he would not contradict the a&s;|&s;ertion of having been abroad: Mrs. Bruce had previ|ou&s;ly informed her of the revolution of affairs. "I own," continued O&s;car, "from her cruelty to my mo|ther, and the depravity of her conduct, I was &s;trongly prejudiced again&s;t her, attributing, I acknowledge, her doing ju&s;tice to us, in &s;ome degree, to her re&s;entment again&s;t the Marquis; but the moment I entered her apartment this prejudice vani&s;hed, giving place to the &s;ofter emotions of pity and tenderne&s;s, while a thorough conviction of her &s;incere repentance broke upon my &s;oul; though prepared to &s;ee a form reduced by affliction and confinement, I was not by any means prepared to &s;ee a form &s;o emaciated, &s;o death-like; a faint motion of her head, as I entered, alone proved her exi&s;tence; had the world been given me to do &s;o, I think I could not have broken a &s;ilence &s;o awful. At length &s;he &s;poke, and in language that pierced my heart, implored my forgivene&s;s for the &s;ufferings &s;he had cau&s;ed me to endure. Re|peatedly I a&s;&s;ured her of it; but this rather heightened than dimini&s;hed her agitation, and tears and &s;obs &s;poke the angui&s;h of her &s;oul. "I have lived," &s;he cried, "to ju&s;tify the ways of Providence to men, and prove that, however calamity may oppre&s;s the virtuous, they or their de&s;cendants &s;hall at la&s;t flouri&s;h. I have lived to &s;ee my contrite wi&s;h accompli&s;hed, and the la&s;t &s;ummons will now be a welcome relea&s;e." She expre&s;&s;ed an ardent de&s;ire to &s;ee her daughter. "The pitying tears of a mother," &s;he exclaimed, "may be as balm to her woun|ded heart. Oh! my prophetic words, how often have I prayed that the puni&s;hment I then denounced again&s;t her might be averted."</P>
<P>"I &s;ignified her de&s;ire," continued O&s;car, "to the Marquis; he &s;ound the Marchione&s;s at fir&s;t reluctant to it, from a &s;ecret dread, I &s;uppo&s;e, of &s;eeing an object &s;o injured; but &s;he at la&s;t con&s;ented, and I was reque&s;t|ed to bring Lady Dunreath from the Abbey, and con|duct her to the Marchione&s;s's room. I will not attempt
<PB N="158" REF="038416_0729_1011E8056390C068">
to de&s;cribe the &s;cene which pa&s;&s;ed between affection on one hand, and penitence on the other; the Marchione&s;s indeed &s;eemed truly penitent&mdash;remor&s;e and horror were vi&s;ible in her countenance, as &s;he gazed upon her injur|ed parent. I begged Lady Dunreath, if agreeable to her, &s;till to con&s;ider the Abbey as her re&s;idence; this, however, &s;he declined, and it was determined &s;he &s;hould continue with her daughter. Her la&s;t moments may, perhaps, be &s;oothed by clo&s;ing in the pre&s;ence of her child; but till then, I think her wretchedne&s;s mu&s;t be aggravated by beholding that of the Marquis's and his wife; their's is that &s;ituation, where comfort can neither be offered nor &s;ugge&s;ted, hopele&s;s and incurable is their &s;orrow: for, to u&s;e the beautiful and emphatic words of a late celebrated writer, "The gates of death are &s;hut upon their pro&s;pects."</P>
<P>Amanda now, after a little he&s;itation, proceeded to inform O&s;car of her real &s;ituation, and intreated him to believe that &s;he never would have had a concealment from him, but for the fear of giving him unea&s;ine&s;s. He folded her to his bo&s;om as &s;he cea&s;ed &s;peaking, declared he rejoiced and congratulated her on having found an object &s;o well qualified to make her happy.</P>
<P>"But where is this dear creature?" cried O&s;car with &s;ome gaiety, "Am I to &s;earch for him, like a favourite Sylph in your bouquet, or with more probability of &s;uc|ce&s;s, &s;eek him among&s;t the &s;hades of the garden?"</P>
<P>"Come," &s;aid he, "your looks confe&s;s our &s;earch will not be trouble&s;ome." He led her to the garden.&mdash;Lord Mortimer, who had lingered near it, &s;aw them ap|proaching. Amanda motioned to him to meet them. He &s;prung forward, and was in&s;tantly introduced by her to Lord Dunreath. The reception he met from him was perhaps one of the mo&s;t flattering proofs he could receive of his Amanda's affection; for what but the mo&s;t ani|mated expre&s;&s;ions in his favour could have made Lord Dunreath, at the fir&s;t introduction, addre&s;s, him with all the fervency of friend&s;hip? Extremes of joy and &s;orrow are difficult to de&s;cribe; I &s;hall therefore, as perfectly con&s;cious of my inability to do ju&s;tice to the &s;cene which
<PB N="159" REF="038416_0730_1011E8083B1FAE60">
followed this introduction, pa&s;s it over in &s;ilence. Lord Dunreath had ordered his equipage and attendants to the village inn, where he him&s;elf intended to lodge; but this was prevented by Lord Cherbury, who informed him he could be accommodated at his &s;teward's: it was here, when they had retired for the night, that Lord Cherbury, having intimated his wi&s;hes for an immediate union with Amanda, all the nece&s;&s;ary preliminaries were talked over and adju&s;ted, and it was agreed the marriage &s;hould take place at the cottage, from whence they &s;hould immediately proceed to Lady Martha's, and that to procure a licence they &s;hould both depart the next morning; at breakfa&s;t, therefore, Amanda was appri&s;ed of their plan, and though the glow of mode&s;ty over|&s;pread her face, &s;he did not with affectation object to it.</P>
<P>With greater expedition than Amanda expected, the travellers returned from the journey they had been obli|ged to take, and at their earne&s;t and united reque&s;t, without any affectation of mode&s;ty, though with its real feelings, Amanda con&s;ented that the marriage &s;hould take place the day but one after their return.</P>
<P>Howell was &s;ent for, and informed of the hour his &s;ervices would be required. His mild eyes evinced to Amanda his &s;incere joy at the termination of her &s;or|rows.</P>
<P>On the de&s;tined morning Lord Dunreath and his friend went over to the cottage, and in a few minutes were joined by their Amanda, the perfect model of in|nocence and beauty: &s;he looked indeed the child of &s;weet &s;implicity, arrayed with the un&s;tudied elegance of a village maid; &s;he had no ornaments but tho&s;e which could never decay, namely, mode&s;ty and meekne&s;s.</P>
<P>Language was inadequate to expre&s;s the feelings of Lord Cherbury; his fine eyes alone could do them ju&s;|tice, alone reveal what might be termed the &s;acred triumph of his &s;oul, at gaining &s;uch a woman. A &s;oft &s;hade of melancholy &s;tole over the fine features of Lord Dunreath, as he witne&s;&s;ed the happine&s;s of Lord Cher|bury: for as his happine&s;s, &s;o might his own have been, but for the blacke&s;t perfidy.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="038416_0731_1011E80C057310B8">
As Lord Cherbury took the trembling hand of Aman|da to lead her from the cottage &s;he gave a farewell &s;igh to a place where it might be &s;aid her happine&s;s had commenced and was completed.</P>
<P>They walked to the church, followed by the nur&s;e and her family. Some kind hand had &s;trewed Lady Malvi|na's grave with the gaye&s;t flowers, and when Amanda reached it, &s;he pau&s;ed involuntarily for a moment, to invoke the &s;pirits of her parents to ble&s;s her union.</P>
<P>Howell was already in the church waiting to receive them, and the ceremony was begun without delay.&mdash;With the true&s;t plea&s;ure did Lord Dunreath give his lovely &s;i&s;ter to Lord Cherbury; and with the livelie&s;t tran&s;ports did he receive her as the choice&s;t gift Heaven could be&s;tow.</P>
<P>Tears of &s;weet &s;en&s;ibility fell from Amanda as Lord Cherbury folded her to his bo&s;om as his own Amanda. Nor was he le&s;s affected: joy of the mo&s;t rapturous kind agitated his whole &s;oul at the completion of an event &s;o earne&s;tly de&s;ired, but &s;o long de&s;paired of. He wiped away her tears, and when &s;he had received the congratulations of her brother, pre&s;ented her to the re&s;t of the little group. Their delight, particularly the nur&s;e's was almo&s;t too great for expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>"Well," &s;he &s;aid, &s;obbing, "thank Cot her wi&s;h was fulfilled: it had peen her prayer, night, noon and morn, to &s;ee the daughter of her tear, tear Captain Fitzalan greatly married."</P>
<P>Poor Ellen wept well: "Now &s;he &s;hould be happy," &s;he &s;aid, "&s;ince &s;he knew her tear young laty was &s;o."</P>
<P>Amanda, affected by the artle&s;s te&s;timonies of affec|tion &s;he received, could only &s;mile upon the faithful creatures.</P>
<P>Lord Cherbury, &s;eeing her inability to &s;peak, took her hand and &s;aid, "Lady Cherbury never will forget the obligations conferred upon Mi&s;s Fitzalan."</P>
<P>Bridal favours and pre&s;ents had already been di&s;tribu|ted among the Edwins. Howell was hand&s;omely com|plimented on the occa&s;ion, and received &s;ome valuable pre&s;ents from Lord Cherbury, as proofs of his &s;incere
<PB N="161" REF="038416_0732_1011E80D96312ED0">
friend&s;hip, al&s;o money to di&s;tribute among the indigent villagers.</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip then handed Amanda into his coach, already prepared for its journey to Thornbury, and the little bridal party were followed with the mo&s;t ardent ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>After proceeding a quarter of a mile they reached Tudor-Hall.</P>
<P>"I wi&s;h, my Lord," cried O&s;car, as they were driv|ing round the wood, you would permit me to &s;top and view the Hall, and al&s;o accompany me to it."</P>
<P>Lord Cherbury looked a little embarra&s;&s;ed: he felt a &s;trong reluctance to vi&s;it it, when no longer his, yet he could not think of refu&s;ing the Earl.</P>
<P>Amanda knew his feelings, and wi&s;hed her brother had not made &s;uch a reque&s;t. No oppo&s;ition, however, being &s;hewn to it, they &s;topt at the great gate, which opened into the avenue, and alighted. This was a long beautiful walk cut through the wood, and in a direct line with the hou&s;e. On either &s;ide were little gra&s;&s;y banks, now covered with a profu&s;ion of gay flowers, and a thick row of trees, which waving their old fan|ta&s;tic branches on high formed a mo&s;t delightful &s;hade. Honey-&s;uckles twined around many of the trunks, forming in &s;ome places luxuriant canopies, and with a variety of aromatic &s;hrubs quite perfumed the air.</P>
<P>It was yet an early hour, the dew therefore &s;till &s;park|led upon the gra&s;s, and every thing looked in the high|e&s;t verdure. Through vi&s;tas in the wood a fine clear ri|ver was &s;een, along who&s;e &s;ides beautiful green &s;lopes were &s;tretched, &s;cattered over with flocks, that &s;pread their &s;welling trea&s;ures to the &s;un. The birds &s;ung &s;weetly in the embowering rece&s;&s;es of the wood, and &s;o calm, &s;o lovely did the place appear, that Lord Cher|bury could not refrain a &s;igh for its lo&s;s.</P>
<P>"How delighted," cried he, ca&s;ting his fine eyes a|round, "&s;hould I have been &s;till to have cheri&s;hed tho&s;e old trees, beneath who&s;e &s;hades &s;ome of my happie&s;t hours were pa&s;t."</P>

They entered the hall, who&s;e folding door they found open; it was large and Gothic; a row of arched win|dows were on either &s;ide, who&s;e rece&s;&s;es were filled with myrtles, ro&s;es, and geraniums, which emitted a delicious perfume, and contra&s;ted with the white walls, gave an appearance of the greate&s;t gaiety to the place.</P>
<P>O&s;car led the way to a &s;pacious parlour at the end of the hall; but how impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the &s;urpri&s;e and plea&s;ure of Lord and Lady Cherbury, on entering it, at beholding Lady Martha and Lady Araminta Dormer.</P>
<P>Lord Cherbury &s;tood transfixed like a &s;tatue; the ca|re&s;&s;es of his aunt and his &s;i&s;ter, which were &s;hared be|tween him and his bride, re&s;tored him to animation; but while they returned them, he ca&s;t his eyes upon O&s;car, and demanded an explanation of the &s;cene.</P>
<P>"I &s;hall give no explanation, my Lord," cried O&s;car, "till you welcome your friends to your hou&s;e."</P>
<P>"My hou&s;e," repeated Lord Cherbury, &s;taring at him.</P>
<P>Lord Dunreath approached; never had he appeared &s;o engaging; the benignant expre&s;&s;ion his countenance a&s;|&s;umed was &s;uch as we may &s;uppo&s;e an angel &s;ent from Heaven, on benevolent purpo&s;es to man, would wear.</P>
<P>"Excu&s;e me, my dear Cherbury," &s;aid he, "for &s;uf|fering you to feel any unea&s;ine&s;s which I could remove, I only did &s;o from an idea of increa&s;ing your plea&s;ure hereafter. In Scotland I was informed of your predilec|tion for my &s;i&s;ter, by Lady Grey&s;tock, who, I fancy, you have both &s;ome rea&s;on to remember, in con&s;equence of which, on &s;eeing Tudor Hall adverti&s;ed, I begged Sir Charles Bingley to purcha&s;e it for me in his own name, from a pre&s;entiment I had that the event I now rejoice at would take place, and from my wi&s;h of having a nup|tial pre&s;ent for my &s;i&s;ter, worthy her acceptance; let me," continued he, taking a hand of each, and joining them together, "let me, in this re&s;pected man&s;ion, and in the dear pre&s;ence of tho&s;e you love, again wi&s;h you a continuance of every ble&s;&s;ing. May this &s;eat, as hereto|fore, be the &s;cene of dome&s;tic happine&s;s: may it ever be a plea&s;ing abode to the pro&s;perous, and an a&s;ylum of comfort to the afflicted."</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="038416_0734_1011E81312E4EDE8">
Lord Cherbury's heart was too full for words; he turned a&s;ide to wipe away his &s;tarting tears. At la&s;t, though in a broken voice, he &s;aid, "I cannot &s;peak my feelings."</P>
<P>"Pain me not," cried O&s;car, "by attempting to do &s;o. From this moment forget that Tudor-Hall was ever out of your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or if you mu&s;t remember it, think it re&s;tored to you with an incumbrance which half the fa&s;hionable men in England would give an e&s;|tate to get rid of, and this will conquer your too refined feelings."</P>
<P>Lord Cherbury &s;miled as he looked at the lovely in|cumbrance which O&s;car alluded to.</P>
<P>"And what &s;hall I &s;ay to my brother?" cried Aman|da, throwing her&s;elf into his arms.</P>
<P>"Why, that you will compo&s;e your &s;pirits, and en|deavour to give a proper welcome to your friends. He pre&s;ented her to Lady Martha and Lady Araminta, who again embraced and congratulated her. He then led her to the head of the breakfa&s;t table, which was elegantly laid out. The timid bride was a&s;&s;i&s;ted in doing the honours by her brother and Lord Cherbury. Lady Martha beheld the youthful pair with the true&s;t delight; never before had &s;he &s;een two, from equal merit and loveline&s;s, &s;o ju&s;tly formed to make each other happy; never had &s;he &s;een either to &s;uch advantage; the beautiful colouring of health and mode&s;ty tinged the &s;oft cheeks of Amanda, and her eyes, through their long la&s;hes, emitted mild beams of plea&s;ure, its brighte&s;t glow mantled the cheeks of Lord Cherbury, and his eyes were again illumined with all their wonted radiancy.</P>
<P>O&s;car was reque&s;ted to tell particularly how he had arranged his plan, which he accordingly did. He had written to the ladies at Thornbury, informing them of his &s;cheme, and reque&s;ting their pre&s;ence, and on the preceding night they had arrived at the Hall. Lord Dunreath al&s;o added, that from a certainty of its being agreeable to Lord Cherbury, he had directed the &s;tew|ard
<PB N="164" REF="038416_0735_1011E815BA132C18">
to rein&s;tate the old &s;ervants in their former &s;tations, and al&s;o to invite the tenants to a nuptial fea&s;t.</P>
<P>Lord Cherbury a&s;&s;ured him he had done what was truly grateful to his feelings; a ramble about the gar|den and &s;hrubberies was propo&s;ed, and agreed to af|ter breakfa&s;t: in the hall and avenue the &s;ervants and tenants were already a&s;&s;embled. Lord Cherbury went among them all, and the grateful joy they expre&s;&s;ed at having him again for a ma&s;ter and landlord deeply af|fected his feelings. He thanked them for their regard, and received their congratulations on his pre&s;ent happi|ne&s;s with that &s;weetne&s;s and affability which always di&s;|tingui&s;hed his manners. The ramble was delightful. When the &s;un had attained its meridian, they &s;ought the cool &s;hade, and retired to little romantic arbours, o'er-canopied with woodbines, where, as if by the hand of enchantment, they found refre&s;hments laid out: they did not return to the hou&s;e till they received a &s;ummons to dinner, and had then the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing the ten|ants &s;eated at long tables in the wood, enjoying with unbounded mirth the profu&s;ion with which they were covered; and lord Cherbury begged Amanda to ob&s;erve her nur&s;e &s;eated at the head of one of the&s;e tables, with an air of the greate&s;t &s;elf importance. The pride and vanity of this good woman (and &s;he always po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a large &s;hare of both) had been con&s;iderably increa&s;ed from the time her cottage was honoured with &s;uch noble gue&s;ts. When &s;he received an invitation from the &s;tew|ard to accompany the re&s;t of the tenants to the Hall, to celebrate its re&s;toration to Lord Cherbury, her joy and exultation knew no bounds; &s;he took care to walk with the wives of &s;ome of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable tenants, de|&s;cribing to them all that had pa&s;&s;ed at the ceremony, and how the Earl had fir&s;t fallen in love with his bride at her cottag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, and what trials they had undergone, no toubt to peove their con&s;tancy. "Cot ple&s;s their hearts &s;he &s;aid co her eager auditors, "&s;he could them of &s;uch tangers, and tifficulties, and tribulations, as would &s;urpri&s;e the very &s;ouls in their poties. Well, well, it was now her dear chilt's turn to hold up her head with
<PB N="165" REF="038416_0736_1011E819A83019E8">
the highe&s;t in the land: and to be &s;ure &s;he might now &s;ay, without telling a lie, that her tear Lady&s;hip would now make &s;ome poty of her&s;elf, and, plea&s;e Cot, &s;he hoped and pelieved, &s;he &s;hould not ti&s;grace or ti&s;parage a petter &s;ituation" When &s;he came near the counte&s;s, &s;he took care to pre&s;s forward for a gracious look; but this was not all, &s;he had always envied the con&s;equence of Mrs. Abergwilly in having &s;o great a hou&s;e as the Hall, entirely under her management; and &s;he now de|termined upon the &s;trength of her favour with Lady Cherbury, to have &s;omething to &s;ay to it, and of cour&s;e increa&s;e her con&s;equence among her neighbours. There was nothing on earth &s;he &s;o much delighted in as a bu&s;|tle, and the pre&s;ent &s;cene was quite adapted to her ta&s;te, for all within and without the hou&s;e was joyous confu&s;i|on. The fir&s;t &s;pecimen &s;he gave of her intention was, in helping to di&s;tribute refre&s;hments among&s;t the ten|ants; &s;he then proceeded to the dinner parlour, to give her opinion and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and direction about laying out the table. Mrs. Abergwilly, like the generality of tho&s;e accu&s;tomed to ab&s;olute power, could not tamely &s;ubmit to any innovation on it. She curbed her re&s;ent|ment, however, and civillity told Mrs. Edwin &s;he want|ed no a&s;&s;i&s;tance: "thank Cot," &s;he &s;aid, "&s;he was not come to this time of tay without peing able to give pro|per tirections about laying out a table."</P>
<P>Mrs. Edwin &s;aid, "To be &s;ure Mrs. Abergwilly might have a very pretty ta&s;te, but then another per|&s;on might have as good a one."</P>
<P>The day was inten&s;ely hot; &s;he pinned back her gown, which was a rich &s;ilk, that had belonged to La|dy Malvina, and without farther ceremony began al|tering the di&s;hes, and &s;aying, "&s;he knew the ta&s;te of her tear Laty the counte&s;s, petter than any one el&s;e, and that &s;he would take an early opportunity of going through the apartments and telling Mrs. Abergwilly how to arrange the furniture."</P>
<P>The Wel&s;h blood of the hou&s;e-keeper could bear no more, and &s;he began abu&s;ing Mrs. Edwin, though
<PB N="166" REF="038416_0737_1011E81BA14C75B8">
in terms &s;carcely articulate; to which &s;he replied with intere&s;t.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t of this fracas old Edwin entered. "For the love of Cot," he a&s;ked, "and the mercy of heaven, could they chu&s;e no other time or day than the pre&s;ent to pegin and fight, and &s;cold, and abu&s;e each other like a couple of Welch witches? What would the noble Earl and the Counte&s;s &s;ay&mdash;Oh Lort! oh Lort! he felt him&s;elf blu&s;hing all over for their mi&s;demeanors."</P>
<P>His remon&s;trance had an immediate effect; they were both a&s;hamed of their conduct; their rage abated, they became friends, and Mrs. Edwin re&s;igned the direction of the dinner table to Mrs. Abergwilly, &s;atisfied with being allowed to pre&s;ide among the tenants.</P>
<P>The bridal party found Howell in the dining par|lour, and his company increa&s;ed their plea&s;ure. After dinner the ru&s;tics commenced their dancing in the ave|nue to the &s;trains of the harp, and afforded a delightful &s;cene of innocent gaiety to their benevolent entertain|ers, who &s;miled to &s;ee
<Q><L>The dancing pair that &s;imply &s;ought renown,</L>
<L>By holding out to tire each other down:</L>
<L>The ba&s;hful virgin's &s;ide-long looks of love,</L>
<L>The matron's glance that would tho&s;e looks reprove.</L></Q></P>
<P>After tea the party went out among&s;t them, and the gentlemen for a &s;hort time mingled in the dance. Long it could not detain Lord Cherbury from his Amanda. Oh! with what ec&s;tacy did he li&s;ten to the &s;oft accents of her voice, while his fond heart a&s;&s;ured him &s;he was now his; the remembrance of his pa&s;t difficulties but in|crea&s;ed his felicity.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the week all the neighbouring fami|lies came to pay their congratulations at Tudor Hall; invitations were given and received, and it again became the &s;eat of plea&s;ure and ho&s;pitality; but Amanda did not &s;uffer the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of happine&s;s to obliterate one grate|ful remembrance from her mind; &s;he was not one of the&s;e &s;elfi&s;h beings who, on being what is termed &s;et|tled for life, immediately contract them&s;elves within the

narrow &s;phere of their own enjoyments; &s;till was her heart as &s;en&s;ible as ever of the glow of friend&s;hip and compa&s;&s;ion: &s;he wrote to all the friends &s;he had ever received kindne&s;&s;es from, in terms of the warme&s;t gra|titude, and her letters were accompanied by pre&s;ents &s;ufficiently valuable to prove her &s;incerity. She &s;ent an invitation to Emily Ru&s;hbrook, which was immediately accepted; and now a di&s;covery took place which infinite|ly &s;urpri&s;ed and plea&s;ed Amanda&mdash;namely, that Howell was the young clergyman Emily was attached to. He had gone to London on a vi&s;it to the gentleman who had patronized him; her youth, her &s;implicity, above all her di&s;tre&s;s, affected his heart, and in the hope of mitigating that di&s;tre&s;s (which he was &s;hocked to &s;ee had been aggravated by the ladies &s;he came to) he had followed her; to &s;oothe the wretched, to relieve the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, was not con&s;idered more a duty than a plea|&s;ure by Howell; and the little favours he conferred up|on the Ru&s;hbrooks afforded, if po&s;&s;ible, more plea&s;ure to him than they did to them; &s;o &s;weet are the feelings of benevolence and virtue. But compa&s;&s;ion was not long the &s;ole motive of his intere&s;t in their affairs; the amiable manners, the gentle conver&s;ation of Emily com|pletely &s;ubdued his unfortunate pa&s;&s;ion for Amanda, and in &s;tealing her image from his heart, &s;he implanted her own in its place. He de&s;cribed in a romantic man|ner the little rural cottage he invited her to &s;hare&mdash;he anticipated the happy period when it &s;hould become an a&s;ylum to her parents&mdash;when he, like a &s;econd father, &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t their children through the devious paths of life; the&s;e fond hopes and expectations vani&s;hed the mo|ment he received Mrs. Connel's letter. He could not think of &s;acrificing the intere&s;t of Ru&s;hbrook to the con&s;ideration of his own happine&s;s, and therefore gene|rou&s;ly, but with the mo&s;t agonizing conflicts, re&s;igned his Emily to a more pro&s;perous rival; his joy at finding her di&s;engaged, &s;till his own unaltered Emily, can bet|ter be conceived than de&s;cribed. He pointed out the little &s;heltered cottage which again he hoped &s;he would &s;hare, and ble&s;t with her the hand that had opened her

father's pri&s;on gates. Lord and Lady Cherbury delight|ed to think they could contribute to the felicity of two &s;uch amiable beings; and the latter wrote to Captain and Mrs. Ru&s;hbrook on the &s;ubject, who immediately replied to her letter, declaring that their fonde&s;t wi&s;h would be gratified in be&s;towing their daughter on How|ell. They were accordingly invited to the Hall; and in the &s;ame &s;pot where a month before he ratified the vows of Lord Cherbury and Amanda, did Howell plight his own to Emily, who from the hand of Lady Cherbury received a nuptial pre&s;ent &s;ufficient to procure every en|joyment her humble and una&s;&s;uming &s;pirit a&s;pired to. Her parents after pa&s;&s;ing a few days in her cottage, departed, rejoicing at the happine&s;s of their beloved child, and truly grateful to tho&s;e who had contributed to it.</P>
<P>And now did the grateful children of Fitzalan amply reward the Edwins for their pa&s;t kindne&s;&s;es to their pa|rents and them&s;elves: an annual &s;tipend was &s;ettled on Edwin by Lord Dunreath, and the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of Ellen were enlarged by Amanda. Now was realized every &s;cheme of dome&s;tic happine&s;s &s;he had ever formed; but even that happine&s;s could not alleviate her feelings on O&s;car's account, who&s;e faded cheek, who&s;e languid eye, who&s;e total ab&s;traction in the mid&s;t of company evidently proved the &s;tate of his heart; and the tear of regret, which had &s;o often fallen for her own &s;orrows, was now &s;hed for his; he had written to Mrs. Marlowe a particular account of every thing which had befallen him &s;ince their &s;eparation: &s;he an&s;wered his letter immediately, and after congratulating him in the warme&s;t terms on the change in his &s;ituation, informed him that Adela was then at one of Belgrave's &s;eats in England, and that he was gone to the continent; hey &s;tyle was melancholy, and &s;he concluded her letter in the&s;e words: "no longer, my dear O&s;car, is my fire-&s;ide enlivened by gaiety or friend&s;hip; &s;ad and &s;olitary I &s;it within my cottage till my heart &s;ickens at the remembrance of pa&s;t &s;cenes, and If I wander from it, the objects without, if po&s;&s;ible, add to the bitterne&s;s of that remembrance.

the gra&s;s-grown paths, the dejected &s;ervants of Wood-lawn, all recall to my mind tho&s;e hours when it was the man&s;ion of ho&s;pitality and plea&s;ure.

<P>ADELA, on the death of her father, was ta|ken by Belgrave to England, though the only plea&s;ure he experienced in removing her was derived from the idea of wounding her feelings, by &s;eparating her from Mrs. Marlowe, whom he knew &s;he was tenderly attach|ed to. From his connections in London &s;he was compelled to mix in &s;ociety&mdash;compelled, I &s;ay, for the natural gaie|ty of her &s;oul was quite gone, and that &s;olitude which permitted her to brood over the remembrance of pa&s;t

Accu&s;tomed from her earlie&s;t youth to the greate&s;t tenderne&s;s, this &s;everity plunged her in the deepe&s;t de&s;pondency, and life was a burthen &s;he would gladly have re&s;igned; her melancholy, or rather her patient &s;weetne&s;s, at la&s;t &s;oftened the flinty nature of her governante, and &s;he was permitted to ex|tend her walks beyond the gardens, to which they had hitherto been confined; but &s;he availed her&s;elf of this permi&s;&s;ion only to vi&s;it the church-yard belonging to the hamlet, who&s;e old yew-trees &s;he had often &s;een waving from the windows. Beneath their &s;olemn gloom &s;he loved to &s;it, while evening clo&s;ed around her; and in a &s;pot, &s;eque&s;tered from every human eye, weep over the recollection of that father &s;he had lo&s;t, that friend &s;he was &s;eparated from.</P>
<P>She remained in the church-yard one night beyond her u&s;ual hour. The &s;oft beams of the moon alone pre|vented her from being involved in darkne&s;s, and the plaintive breathings of a flute from the neighbouring hamlet ju&s;t &s;tole upon her ear. Lo&s;t in &s;adne&s;s, her head re&s;ting upon her hand, &s;he forgot the progre&s;s of time; when &s;uddenly &s;he beheld a form ri&s;ing from a neighbouring grave. She &s;tarted up, &s;creamed, but had no power to move; the form advanced to her; it was the figure of a venerable man, who gently exclaimed, "be not afraid!" His voice di&s;&s;ipated the involuntary fears of Adela; but &s;till &s;he trembled &s;o much &s;he could not move. "I thought," cried he, gazing on her, "this place had been alone the haunt of wretchedne&s;s and me." "If &s;acred to &s;orrow," exclaimed Adela, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">well may claim the privilege of entering it." She

&s;poke involuntarily, and her words &s;eemed to affect the &s;tranger deeply. "So young," &s;aid he, " tis melancho|ly indeed; but &s;till the &s;orrows of youth are more beara|ble than tho&s;e of age; becau&s;e like age it has not out|lived the fond ties, the &s;weet connexions of life."&mdash;"Alas!" cried Adela unable to repre&s;s her feelings, "I am &s;eparated from all I regarded." The &s;tranger leaned pen&s;ively again&s;t a tree for a few minutes, and then a|gain addre&s;&s;ed her: "'Tis a late hour," &s;aid he, "&s;uf|fer me to conduct you home, and al&s;o permit me to a&s;k if I may &s;ee you here to-morrow night. Your youth, your manner, your dejection, all intere&s;t me deeply; the &s;orrows of youth are often increa&s;ed by imagination.&mdash;You will &s;ay nothing can exceed its pains; 'tis true, but it is a weakne&s;s to yield to them&mdash;a weakne&s;s which from a &s;en&s;ible mind will be eradicated the moment it hears of the real calamities of life; &s;uch a relation I can give you, if you meet me to-morrow night in this &s;ad, this &s;olitary &s;pot; a &s;pot I have vi&s;ited every clo&s;ing evening, without ever before meeting a being in it.</P>
<P>His venerable looks, his gentle, pathetic manner, affected Adela inexpre&s;&s;ibly; &s;he gazed on him with emotions &s;omewhat &s;imilar to tho&s;e with which &s;he u&s;ed to contemplate the mild features of her father. "I will meet you," cried &s;he, "but my &s;orrows are not ima|ginary." She refu&s;ed to let him attend her home; and in this incident there was &s;omething affecting and ro|mantic, which &s;oothed and engro&s;&s;ed the mind.</P>
<P>She was punctual the next evening to the appointed hour. The &s;tranger was already in the church-yard; he &s;eated her at the head of the grave from which &s;he had &s;een him ri&s;e the preceding night, and which was only di&s;tingui&s;hed from the others by a few flowering &s;hrubs planted around it, and began his promi&s;ed narrative.&mdash;He had not proceeded far ere Adela began to tremble with emotion&mdash;as it continued it encrea&s;ed. At la&s;t &s;uddenly catching his hand, with wildne&s;s, &s;he exclaim|ed&mdash;"She lives&mdash;the wife &s;o bitterly lamented &s;till lives, a &s;olitary mourner for your &s;ake. Oh never! never did &s;he injure you as you &s;uppo&s;e. Oh dear ine&s;timable Mrs.

Marlowe, what happine&s;s to the child of your care, to think that through her means you will regain the being you have &s;o tenderly regretted; regain him with a heart open to receive you. The deep convul&s;ive &s;obs of her companion now pierced her ear; for many minutes he was unable to &s;peak: at la&s;t, rai&s;ing his eyes, "Oh Pro|vidence! I thank thee," he exclaimed; "again &s;hall my arms fold to my heart its be&s;t beloved object. Oh, my Fanny, how have I injured thee! Learn from me," he continued, turning to Adela, "Oh learn from me ne|ver to yield to ra&s;hne&s;s; had I allowed my&s;elf time to inquire into the particulars of my wife's conduct; had I re&s;i&s;ted, in&s;tead of obeying the violence of pa&s;&s;ion, what years of lingering mi&s;ery &s;hould I have &s;aved us both. But tell me where I &s;hall find my &s;olitary mourner, as you call her." Adela gave him the de&s;ired informa|tion, and al&s;o told him her own &s;ituation. "The wife of Belgrave!" he repeated, "then I wonder not," con|tinued he, as if involuntarily, "at your &s;orrows." It was indeed to Howell, the unfortunate father of Juliana, the regretted hu&s;band of Mrs. Marlowe, that Adela had been addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf. He checked him&s;elf, however, and told her, that the being by who&s;e grave they &s;at, had been hurried, through the villainy of Belgrave, to that grave. Adela told him of the prohibition again&s;t her writing; but at the &s;ame time a&s;&s;ured him, ere the following night &s;he would find an opportunity of wri|ting a letter, which he &s;hould bring to Mrs. Marlowe, who by its contents would be prepared for his appear|ance, as it was to be &s;ent in to her. But Adela was prevented from putting her intention into execution by an event as &s;olemn as unexpected.</P>
<P>The en&s;uing morning &s;he was di&s;turbed from &s;leep by a violent noi&s;e in the hou&s;e, as of people running back|wards and forwards in confu&s;ion and di&s;tre&s;s. She was hurrying on her clothes to go and enquire into the cau&s;e of it, when a &s;ervant ru&s;hed into the room, and in a ha&s;|ty manner told her that Colonel Belgrave was dead.&mdash;Struck with horror and amazement, Adela &s;tood pertre|fied, gazing on her; the maid repeated her words, and
<PB N="173" REF="038416_0744_1011E82F2631AA08">
added that he had died abroad and his remains were brought over to Wood hou&s;e for interment, attended by a French gentleman, who looked like a prie&s;t. The va|rious emotions which a&s;&s;ailed the heart of Adela at this moment were too much for her weak frame, and &s;he would have fallen to the floor but for the maid, it was &s;ome time ere &s;he recovered her &s;en&s;ibility, and when &s;he did regain it, &s;he was &s;till &s;o agitated as to be una|ble to give tho&s;e directions, which the dome&s;tics, who now looked up to her in a very different light from what they had hitherto done, demanded from her. All &s;he could de&s;ire was, that the &s;teward &s;hould pay every re&s;pect and attention to the gentleman who had attended the remains of his ma&s;ter, and have every hanour that was due &s;hewn to tho&s;e remains.&mdash;To &s;uppo&s;e &s;he regret|ted Belgrave would be unnatural; but &s;he felt horror, mingled with a degree of pity, for his untimely fate, at the idea of his dying abroad, without one connexion, one friend near him.</P>
<P>His la&s;t moments were indeed more wretched than &s;he could conceive. Overwhelmed with terror and grief, he had quitted England: terror at the &s;uppo&s;ition of a crime which in reality he had not committed, and grief for the fate of Amanda. He &s;ought to lo&s;e his horrors in in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">brity, but this, joined to the agitations of the mind, brought on a violent fever, by the time he had landed at Calais, in the paroxi&s;m of which, had the at|tendants under&s;tood his language, they would have been &s;hocked at the crimes he revealed. His &s;en&s;es were re|&s;tored a &s;hort time before he died; but what excrucia|ting angui&s;h, as well as horror did he &s;uffer from their re&s;toration; he knew from his own feelings, as well as from the looks of his attendants, that his la&s;t moments were approaching; and the recollection of pa&s;t actions made him &s;hudder at tho&s;e moments. Oh Howell! how were you amply avenged for all the pangs he made you &s;uffer. Now did the pale image of your &s;hrouded Julia|na &s;eem to &s;tand be&s;ide his bed, reproaching his barba|rity. Every treacherous action now ro&s;e to view, and trembling he groaned with terror at the &s;pectres which
<PB N="174" REF="038416_0745_1011E831415EBD10">
a guilty con&s;cience rai&s;ed around him. Death would have been a relea&s;e, could he have con&s;idered it an an|nihilation of all exi&s;tence; but that future world he had always derided, that world was opening in all its awful horrors to his view. Already he &s;aw him&s;elf before its &s;acred judge, &s;urrounded by the accu&s;ing &s;pirits of tho&s;e he had injured. He de&s;ired a clergyman to be brought to him; a prie&s;t was &s;ent for&mdash;their faiths were differ|ent, but &s;till, as a man of God. Belgrave applied to him for an alleviation of his tortures; the prie&s;t was &s;uper|&s;titious, and ere he tried to comfort he wi&s;hed to con|vert; but &s;carcely had he commenced the attempt, ere the wretched being before him cla&s;ped his hands toge|ther, in a &s;trong convul&s;ion, and expired. The Engli&s;h &s;ervant who attended Belgrave informed the people of the hotel of his rank and fortune, and the prie&s;t offered to accompany his remains to England. He was, by the direction of Adela, who had not re&s;olution to &s;ee him, amply rewarded for his attention; and in two days after their arrival at Wood-hou&s;e, the remains of Belgrave were con&s;igned to their kind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed earth. From a &s;eque&s;|tered corner of the church yard Howell witne&s;&s;ed his interment; when all had departed he approached the grave of his daughter&mdash;"He is gone!" he exclaimed, "my Juliana, your betrayer is gone; at the tribunal of his God he now an&s;wers for his cruelty to you. But oh! may he find mercy from that God; may he pardon him as in this &s;olemn moment I have done&mdash;my enmity lives not beyond the grave."</P>
<P>Adela now &s;ent for Howell, and after their fir&s;t emo|tions had &s;ub&s;ided, informed him &s;he meant immediately to return to Ireland; the expectation of her doing &s;o had alone prevented his going before. They according|ly commenced their journey the en&s;uing day, and in le&s;s than a week reached the dear and de&s;tined &s;pot, &s;o in|tere&s;ting to both; they had previou&s;ly &s;ettled on the manner in which the di&s;covery &s;hould be revealed to Mrs. Marlowe, and Adela went alone into her cottage &s;ad and &s;olitary, as Mrs. Marlowe &s;aid in her letter to O&s;car, did Adela find her in her in her parlour; but it was a
<PB N="175" REF="038416_0746_1011E833D3F373D0">
&s;adne&s;s which vani&s;hed the moment &s;he beheld her.&mdash;With all the tenderne&s;s of a mother &s;he cla&s;ped Adela to her brea&s;t, and in the &s;udden tran&s;ports of joy and &s;urpri&s;e, for many minutes did not notice her dre&s;s; but when &s;he did ob&s;erve it, what powerful emotions did it excite in her brea&s;t! Adela, &s;carcely le&s;s agitated than &s;he was, could not for many minutes, relate all that had happened; at la&s;t the idea of the &s;tate in which &s;he had left Howell, made her endeavour to compo&s;e her|&s;elf. Mrs. Marlowe wept while &s;he related her &s;uffer|ings; but when &s;he mentioned Howell, &s;urpri&s;e &s;u&s;pend|ed her tears; a &s;urpri&s;e, increa&s;ed when &s;he began the &s;tory; but when &s;he came to that part where &s;he her|&s;elf had betrayed &s;uch emotion, while li&s;tening to How|ell, Mrs. Marlowe &s;tarted and turned pale. "Your feelings are &s;imilar to mine," &s;aid Adela, "at this peri|od I became agitated. Yes," &s;he continued, "it was at this period I laid my trembling hand on his, and exclaim|ed, &s;he lives!" "Merciful heaven!" cried Mrs. Mar|lowe, "what do you mean?" "Oh! let me now," cried Adela, cla&s;ping her arms round her, "repeat to you the &s;ame expre&s;&s;ion: he lives! that hu&s;band, &s;o beloved and regretted, lives!" "Oh bring him to me!" &s;aid Mrs. Marlowe, in a faint voice, "let me behold him while I have rea&s;on my&s;elf to enjoy the ble&s;&s;ing." Adela flew from the room; Howell was near the door. He ap|proached&mdash;he entered the room. He tottered forward, and in one moment was at the feet, and in the arms of his wife, who transfixed to the chair, could only open her arms to receive him. The mingled pain and plea&s;ure of &s;uch a re-union cannot be de&s;cribed; both with tears of grateful tran&s;port, ble&s;t the power which had given &s;uch comfort to their clo&s;ing days. "But my children," exclaimed Mrs. Marlowe, &s;uddenly, "ah! when &s;hall I behold my children! why did they not accompany you? ah! did they deem me then unworthy of be&s;towing a mother's ble&s;&s;ing?" Howell trembled, and turned pale. "I &s;ee," &s;aid Mrs. Marlowe, interpreting his emotion, I am a wife but not a mother." Howell recovering his fortitude, took her hand, and pre&s;&s;ed it to his bo&s;om;
<PB N="176" REF="038416_0747_1011E838B36E88D0">
"yes," he replied, "you are a mother; one dear, one amiable child remains. Heaven be prai&s;ed!" he pau&s;ed and a tear fell to the memory of Juliana.&mdash;"But hea|ven," he re&s;umed has taken the other to its eternal re&s;t.&mdash;Inquire not concerning her at pre&s;ent, I intreat; &s;oon will I conduct you to the grave, there will I relate her fate, and together will we mourn it&mdash;then &s;hall the tears that never yet bedewed the grave, the precious tears of a mother, embalm her &s;acred du&s;t!"</P>
<P>Mrs. Marlowe wept but &s;he complied with her hu&s;|band's reque&s;t; &s;he inquired in a broken voice about her &s;on, and the knowledge of his happine&s;s gradually cheered her mind.</P>
<P>Adela con&s;ented to &s;tay that night in the cottage, but the next day &s;he determined on going to Woodlawn; to think &s;he &s;hould again wander through it, again linger in the walks &s;he had trodden with tho&s;e &s;he loved, gave to her mind a melancholy plea&s;ure. The next morning, attended by her friend, &s;he repaired to it, and was inex|pre&s;&s;ibly affected by reviewing &s;cenes endeared by tender remembrances of happy hours. The hou&s;e, from its clo&s;ed windows, appeared quite neglected and melancho|ly, as if plea&s;ure had for&s;aken it with the poor departed General. Standard, his favourite hor&s;e, grazed in the lawn, and be&s;ide him, as if a &s;ecret &s;ympathy endeared them to each other, &s;tood the dog that always attended the General in his walks; it in&s;tantly recollected Adela, and running to her, licked her hand, and evinced the ut|mo&s;t joy. She patted him on the head, while her tears bur&s;t forth at the idea of him who had been his ma&s;ter. The tran&s;ports of the old dome&s;tics, particularly of the grey headed butler, at her unexpected return, increa&s;ed her tears. But when &s;he entered the parlour, in which her father u&s;ually &s;at, &s;he was quite overcome, and mo|tioning with her hand for her friends not to mind her, &s;he retired to the garden. There was a little romantic root-hou&s;e at the termination of it, where &s;he and O&s;car had pa&s;&s;ed many happy hours together; thither &s;he re|paired, and his idea, thus revived in her mind, did not le&s;&s;en its dejection. While &s;he &s;at within it indulging
<PB N="177" REF="038416_0748_1011E83B5848BC60">
her &s;orrow, her eye caught &s;ome lines in&s;cribed on one of its windows. She ha&s;tily aro&s;e, and examined them in&s;tantly recollected the hand of O&s;car. They were as follows:</P>
<LG>
<L>Adieu, &s;weet girl, a la&s;t adieu!</L>
<L>We part to meet no more;</L>
<L>Adiau to peace, to hope, to you,</L>
<L>And to my native &s;hore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If fortune had propitious &s;mil'd,</L>
<L>My love had made me ble&s;t;</L>
<L>But &s;he, like me, is &s;orrow's child,</L>

<P>O&s;car, previous to his going to England, with the expectation of being &s;ent to the We&s;t-Indies, had paid a &s;ecret vi&s;it to Wood-Lawn, to review and bid adieu to every well-known and beloved &s;pot, and had one morn|ing at early day in&s;cribed tho&s;e lines on a window in the root-hou&s;e, prompted by a tender melancholy he could not re&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>"His love is then unfortunate," &s;aid Adela, pen&s;ive|ly leaning her head upon her hand; "Oh O&s;car! how &s;ad a &s;imilitude is there between your fate and mine!" She returned to the hou&s;e&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Howell (for &s;o we &s;hall in future call Mrs. Marlowe, that name be|ing only a&s;&s;umed while her hu&s;band had a pro&s;pect of inheriting his uncle's fortune) had con&s;ented to &s;tay &s;ome time with her. O&s;car's, lines run in her head the whole day; and in the evening &s;he again &s;tole out to read them.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="038416_0749_1011E83CEF1A26B8">
She had been ab&s;ent &s;ome time when Mrs. Howell came out to her: Adela blu&s;hed and &s;tarted at being caught at the window. "'Tis a long time, my dear A|dela," &s;aid Mrs. Howell, "&s;ince we had a ramble in this delightful garden together; indulge me in taking one, and let us talk of pa&s;t times." "Pa&s;t times!" cried Adela, with a faint &s;mile, "are not always the plea&s;ant|e&s;t to talk about." "There are &s;ome, at lea&s;t one friend," cried Mrs. Howell, "whom you have not yet inquired after." Adela's heart &s;uddenly palpitated; &s;he gue&s;&s;ed who that one friend was. "O&s;car Fitzalan, &s;urely," continued Mrs. Howell, "merits an inquiry; I have good news to tell you of him, therefore, without chiding you for any &s;eeming neglect I will reveal it." She accordingly related his late rever&s;e of &s;ituation.&mdash;Adela heard her with deep attention. "Since fortune then is propitious at la&s;t," cried &s;he, "his love will no longer be unfortunate." "'Tis time, indeed," &s;aid Mrs. Howell, looking at her with plea&s;ure, "that love &s;o pure, &s;o con&s;tant as his, &s;hould be rewarded. Oh! Ade|la," &s;he continued, &s;uddenly taking her hand, "&s;weet daughter of my care, how great is my happine&s;s at this moment, to think of that about to be your portion." "My happine&s;s!" exclaimed Adela in a dejected voice. "Yes," replied Mrs. Howell, "in your union with a man every way worthy of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing you; a man who, from the fir&s;t moment he beheld you, has never cea&s;ed to love&mdash;in &s;hort, with O&s;car Fitzalan him&s;elf."</P>
<P>"Impo&s;&s;ible!" cried Adela, trembling with emoti|on as &s;he &s;poke: "Did not&mdash;how humiliating is the remembrance! did not O&s;car Fitzalan reject me, when the too generous and romantic &s;pirit of my beloved fa|ther offered my hand to his acceptance?"</P>
<P>"For once," &s;aid Mrs. Howell, "I mu&s;t di&s;turb the &s;acred a&s;hes of the dead, to prevent the innocent from being unhappy. Oh! Adela, you were cruelly deceived, and the moment which gave you to Belgrave rendered O&s;car the mo&s;t wretched of mankind. My heart was the repo&s;itory of all his griefs, and how many are the bit|ter tears I have &s;hed over them. Be compo&s;ed," conti|nued
<PB N="179" REF="038416_0750_1011E83E7AB7B148">
&s;he, &s;eeing Adela's agitation, "and a few moments will explain every thing to you." She led her back to the root-hou&s;e, and in the mo&s;t explicit manner informed her of Belgrave's treachery. Adela bur&s;t into tears as &s;he concluded. She wept on Mrs. Howell's bo&s;om, and acknowledged &s;he had removed a weight of unea&s;ine&s;s from her mind. "Poor O&s;car," &s;he continued, "how much would the knowledge of his mi&s;ery have aggravat|ed mine!" "He acted nobly," &s;aid Mrs. Howell, "in concealing it; and amply will he be rewarded for &s;uch conduct." She then proceeded to inform Adela that &s;he &s;oon expected a vi&s;it from him. There was &s;omething in her look and manner which in&s;tantly excited the &s;u&s;|picion of Adela, who blu&s;hing, &s;tarting, trembling, ex|claimed&mdash;"He is already come!" Mrs. Howell &s;miled, and a tear fell from her upon the &s;oft hand of Adela "He is already come," &s;he repeated, "and he waits, oh how impatiently! to behold his Adela."</P>
<P>We may believe his patience was not put to a much longer te&s;t. But when Adela in reality beheld him as &s;he entered the parlour, where &s;he had left Mr. How|ell, and where he waited for the re-appearance of her friend, &s;he &s;unk beneath her emotion, upon that faith|ful bo&s;om which had &s;o long &s;uffered the mo&s;t excruci|ating pangs on her account; and it was many minutes ere &s;he was &s;en&s;ible of the &s;oft voice of O&s;car. Oh! who &s;hall paint his tran&s;ports, after all his &s;ufferings, to be thus rewarded! But in the mid&s;t of his happine&s;s the idea of the poor General, who had &s;o generou&s;ly planned it, &s;truck upon his heart with a pang of &s;orrow. "Oh, my Adela!" he cried, cla&s;ping her to his heart, as if doubly endeared by the remembrance, "is O&s;car at la&s;t permitted to pour forth the fulne&s;s of his &s;oul before you, to reveal its tenderne&s;s, to indulge the hope of cal|ling you his, a hope which affords the delightful pro&s;|pect of being able to contribute to your felicity. Yes, mo&s;t generous of friends," he exclaimed, rai&s;ing his eyes to a picture of the General, "I will endeavour to evince my gratitude to you by my conduct to your child." Oh! how did the tear he &s;hed to the memory of her fa|ther
<PB N="180" REF="038416_0751_1011E8435FAC6218">
intere&s;t the heart of Adela: her own fell with it, and &s;he felt that the pre&s;ence of that being to whom they were con&s;ecrated was alone wanting to complete their happine&s;s. It was long ere &s;he was &s;ufficiently compo&s;ed to inquire the rea&s;on of O&s;car's &s;udden ap|pearance, and &s;till longer ere he could inform her.&mdash;Mrs. Marlowe's melancholy letter, he at la&s;t &s;aid, had brought him over, with the hope of being able to cheer her &s;olitude, and al&s;o (he acknowledged) his own de|jection by mutual &s;ympathy; from her cottage he had been directed to Wood-lawn, and at Wood-lawn receiv|ed particulars not only of her happine&s;s but his own.&mdash;Adela, who had never yet deviated from propriety, would not now infringe it, and re&s;olutely determined, till the expiration of her mourning, not to be&s;tow her hand on O&s;car; but permitted him to hope, that in the inter|vening &s;pace mo&s;t of his time might be devoted to her; it was nece&s;&s;ary however to &s;anction that hope by having proper &s;ociety. She could not flatter her&s;elf with much longer retaining Mr. and Mrs. Howell, as the latter particularly was impatient to behold her &s;on. O&s;car therefore reque&s;ted and obtained permi&s;&s;ion from Adela, to write in her name to Lord and Lady Cherbury, and intreat their company at Woodlawn, promi&s;ing &s;he would then accompany them to Ca&s;tle Carberry, and from thence to Dunreath Abbey, a tour which, previous to O&s;car's leaving Wales, had been agreed on. The invitation was accepted, and in a few days O&s;car beheld the two beings mo&s;t valued by him in the world, intro|duced to each other; tears of rapture &s;tarted to his eyes as he &s;aw his Adela folded to the bo&s;om of his love|ly &s;i&s;ter, who called her the &s;weet re&s;torer of her bro|ther's happine&s;s! Lord Cherbury was already acquainted with her, and, next to his Amanda, con&s;idered her the lovelie&s;t of human beings; and Lady Martha and Lady Araminta, who were al&s;o invited to Woodlawn, regard|ed her in the &s;ame light. A few days after their arri|val, Mrs. Howell prepared for her departure. Adela, who con&s;idered her as a &s;econd mother, could not behold the&s;e preparations without tears of real regret. "Oh,
<PB N="181" REF="038416_0752_1011E846036F5D30">
my Adela!" &s;he exclaimed, "the&s;e tears flatter, yet di&s;tre&s;s me; I am plea&s;ed to think the child of my care regards me with &s;uch affection, but I am hurt to think &s;he &s;hould con&s;ider my lo&s;s &s;uch an affliction. Oh, my child! may the endearments of the friends who &s;ur|round you &s;teal from you all painful remembrances: nature calls me from you, I &s;igh to behold my child; I &s;igh," &s;he continued, with eyes &s;uffu&s;ed in tears, "to behold the precious earth which holds another."</P>
<P>About three weeks after her departure, the whole par|ty proceeded to Ca&s;tle Carberry. Amanda could not re|enter it without emotions of the mo&s;t painful nature; &s;he recollected the moment in which &s;he had quitted it, oppre&s;t with &s;orrow and &s;ickne&s;s, to attend the clo&s;ing period of a father's life. She wept&mdash;and &s;ighed to think that the happine&s;s he had prayed for, he could not behold&mdash;Lord Cherbury &s;aw her emotions, and &s;oothed them with the &s;ofte&s;t tenderne&s;s; it was due to that tender|ne&s;s to conquer her dejection, and in future the remem|brance of her father was only attended with a plea&s;ing melancholy. She did not delay vi&s;iting the convent; the good natured nuns crowded around her, and cried, laughed and wi&s;hed her joy almo&s;t in the &s;ame moment, particularly Si&s;ter Mary; the priore&s;s's plea&s;ure was of a le&s;s violent, but more affecting nature: an almo&s;t con|&s;tant &s;cene of gaiety was kept up at the Ca&s;tle, a gaiety, however, which did not prevent Lord and Lady Cherbu|ry from in&s;pecting into the &s;ituation of their poor tenants, who&s;e wants they relieved, who&s;e grievances they re|dre&s;&s;ed, and who&s;e hearts they cheared by a promi&s;e of &s;pending &s;ome months in every year at the Ca&s;tle. After conti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ning at it &s;ix weeks, they cro&s;&s;ed over to Port-Pa|trick, and from thence proceeded to Dunreath Abbey, which had been completely repaired and furni&s;hed in a &s;tyle equally modern and elegant; and here it was deter|mined they &s;hould remain till the &s;olemnization of Lord Dunreath's nuptials. The time which intervened till the period appointed for them, was agreeably diver&s;ified, by parties among&s;t the neighbouring families, and exten&s;i|ons about the country; but no hours were happier than
<PB N="182" REF="038416_0753_1011E847D9408210">
tho&s;e which the inhabitants of the Abbey pa&s;&s;ed when free from company, &s;o truly were they united to each other by affection. Lord Dunreath, &s;oon after his return, waited upon the Marquis of Ro&s;line, and by his &s;i&s;ter's de&s;ire &s;ignified to him that if a vi&s;it from her would be agreeable to the Marquis, &s;he would pay it; this, how|ever, was declined, and about the &s;ame period Lady Dun|reath died. Mrs. Bruce, who from long habit &s;he was attached to, then retired to another part of Scotland, a&s;hamed to remain where her conduct was known, a con|duct which deeply affected her niece, whom Amanda vi|&s;ited immediately after her arrival, and found &s;ettled in a neat hou&s;e near the town &s;he had lodged in. She re|ceived Lady Cherbury with every demon&s;tration of real plea&s;ure, and both &s;he and her little girls &s;pent &s;ome time with her at the Abbey.</P>
<P>The happy period for compleating the felicity of O&s;car at la&s;t arrived. In the chapel where his parents were united he received from the hand of Lord Cherbury the lovely object of his long tried affections. The ceremo|ny was only witne&s;&s;ed by his own particular friends; but at dinner all the neighbouring families were a&s;&s;embled, and the tenants were entertained in the great hall, where dancing commenced at an early, and was continued to a late hour; now having (to u&s;e the words of Adam) brought our &s;tory to the &s;um of earthly bli&s;s, we &s;hall conclude; fir&s;t giving a brief account of the characters connected with it.</P>

After the death of Lady Eu|phra&s;ia, &s;he found her company no longer de&s;ired at the Marquis's and accordingly repaired to Bath; here &s;he had not been long ere &s;he became acquainted with a &s;et of female puritans, who &s;oon wrought a total change (I will not &s;ay a reformation) in her lady&s;hip's &s;enti|ments; and to give a convincing proof of this change, &s;he was prevailed on to give her hand to one of their &s;pruce young preachers, who &s;hortly taught her what indeed &s;he had long wanted to learn, the doctrine of re|pentance, for mo&s;t &s;incerely did &s;he repent putting her|&s;elf

into his power. Vexation, di&s;appointment and grief brought on a lingering illne&s;s, from which &s;he ne|ver recovered: when convinced &s;he was dying, &s;he &s;ent for Ru&s;hbrook and made a full confe&s;&s;ion of her treach|ery and inju&s;tice to him, in con&s;equence of which he took immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his uncle's fortune; and thus in the evening of his life enjoyed a full recompence for the trials of its early period. Lady Grey&s;tock died with &s;ome degree of &s;atisfaction at the idea of di&s;ap|pointing her hu&s;band of the fortune &s;he was convinced he had married her for.</P>
<P>Mrs. Howell after vi&s;iting her &s;on, retired to her hu&s;|band's cottage, where their days glide on in a kind of plea&s;ing melancholy; the happine&s;s of that &s;on and his Emily is as perfect as happine&s;s can be in this &s;ublunary &s;tate.</P>

He did not refu&s;e the invitation of Lord Cherbury, the dome&s;tic happine&s;s he &s;aw him en|joying, rendered his own unconnected and wandering life more unplea&s;ant than ever to him. Lady Araminta Dormer was almo&s;t con&s;tantly in his company; no longer fa&s;cinated by Amanda, he could now &s;ee and ad|mire her perfections; he &s;oon made known his admi|ration; the declaratian was not ungraciou&s;ly received, and he offered his hand and was accepted, an accept|ance which put him in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of happine&s;s equal to Lord Cherbury's.</P>
<P>The Marquis and Marchione&s;s of Ro&s;line pa&s;s their days in gloomy retirement, regretful of the pa&s;t, and hople&s;s of the future. Freelove flutters about every public place, boa&s;ts of having carried off a Scotch heir|e&s;s; and thinks from that circum&s;tance he may now lay &s;iege to any female heart with a certainty of being &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
