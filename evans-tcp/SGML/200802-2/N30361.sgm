<HEAD>THE Examination &amp; Confe&s;&s;ion of Edward Fitz-Partrick After his committing Murder on the Body of Daniel Campbell at Rutland, on the 8th Day of March 1743,4.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Memorandum <DATE><HI>March</HI> 27th 1744.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>THIS Day about 10 o'Clock in the Forenoon, Mr. <HI>Luke Brown,</HI> un|der Keeper of the Goal in <HI>Wor|ce&s;ter,</HI> informed me the Sub&s;criber one of His Maje&s;ty's Ju&s;tices of the Peace for the County of <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> that he had been read|ing &s;undry Pa&s;&s;ages of holy Writ to <HI>Edward Fitz Partrick</HI> relating to Murder; and after &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e thereon, (as <HI>Brown</HI> in|formed me) <HI>Fitz Partrick</HI> told him if Mr. <HI>Burr</HI> and my&s;elf would come to the Goal, he would confe&s;s the whole Truth (relat|ing to <HI>Campbell</HI>'s Murder;) accordingly be|tween one &amp; two o'Clock in the Afternoon we went to him, <HI>Brown</HI> being pre&s;ent. <HI>Fitz Partrick,</HI> confe&s;s'd him&s;elf to be guilty of willfully murdering &s;aid <HI>Campbell,</HI> by throwing him down, and &s;trangling him; and in the Fray <HI>Campbell</HI> bit the middle Finger of his right Hand (which now had the Wounds on it) which bled, and with which it was that he blooded his Cloaths with, that he &s;aid <HI>Partrick</HI> had on when the Murder was done, (the Cloaths being now in my Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and the Jacket bloody.)</P>
<P>I then a&s;k'd him if <HI>Campbell</HI> did not bleed? he an&s;wered, no, he &s;trangled him and did not &s;trike him to make him bleed.</P>
<P>This Murder was committed the Thur&s;|day Night before the dead Body of <HI>Camp|bell</HI> was found, being the 8th in&s;tant.</P>
<P><HI>Fitz Partrick</HI> further declared that the Evening before the Murder was done, <HI>Campbell</HI> and he had been to <HI>William Whitaker</HI>'s, and the &s;aid <HI>Partrick</HI> came home fir&s;t and went to the Barn, and when <HI>Campbell</HI> came home, he told him the Cattle were loo&s;e in the Barn; this he did to get him out, and they both ran to the Barn together, where he did the Murder in the Manner afore&s;aid: After which he car|ry'd the dead Body to the Place where it was bury'd, that he dug the Grave with the Spade found in the Hou&s;e, and on Saturday Morning he covered the Grave with Loggs, that he cut off &s;ome Buttons of <HI>Campbell's</HI> Jacket, and de&s;ign'd them for his own Breeches (which Buttons I now have by me) that &s;ome Mu&s;lin &s;ince found in his Pocket, he took out of <HI>Campbell's</HI> Che&s;t &s;ome Time after the Murder.</P>
<P>He al&s;o own'd, he took a Snuff Box out of &s;aid Che&s;t, hung &amp; tipt with Silver, with &s;omething in it; as al&s;o another Box; and as he was opening one of 'em atone <HI>Lamond</HI>'s Hou&s;e in <HI>Rutland,</HI> &s;omething fell out of the Box, &amp; he had not Time to look for it, nor did he know what it was; that he hid the Box hung and tipt with Silver by a Stump near <HI>Campbell</HI>'s Hou&s;e in the Road; that he hid a Box called a Cannoe Box of <HI>Campbell</HI>'s in the Wall near &s;aid <HI>Lamond's</HI> Hou&s;e; that he hid a pair of Shoes of <HI>Campbell</HI>'s in a Heap of Stones near the Barn with the Soles upward, and a &s;lat Stone laid over them. A pair of Silver Shoe-Buckles of <HI>Campbell</HI>'s he hid under a Log between the Hou&s;e and Barn.</P>
<P>He acknowledged his Inducement to kill him, was to get his Things, and that he alone did the Murder, and no other Per&s;on was concerned with him. He further added, That in the &s;cuffle <HI>Campbell</HI> &s;truck him a &s;evere Blow with his Foot on his right Brea&s;t, that almo&s;t took his Life a|way, but recovering, he &s;oon di&s;patch'd him. The Mark on his Brea&s;t where he was hurt he &s;hew'd us.</P>
<P>I a&s;k'd him if he had any angry Words, or had differed with <HI>Campbell:</HI> he &s;aid, that &s;ome little Time before he had bro't home &s;ome Rum and &s;old Part of it to him, and that he thought <HI>Campbell</HI> had not done him Ju&s;tice; that he was a little dirty na&s;tly Fellow, and he did not like him: He told us, that he was &s;o troubled he could not &s;leep, the Night the Murder was committed, nor the Night after but a little.</P>
<P>The aforewritten Confe&s;&s;ion, <HI>Edward Fitz-Patrick</HI> acknowledged freely before the Reverend Mr. <HI>Burr, Luke Brown,</HI> and my &s;elf, the Day fir&s;t written.</P>
