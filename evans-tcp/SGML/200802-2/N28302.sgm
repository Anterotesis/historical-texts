<OPENER><SALUTE>MEN, BRETHREN, <HI>and</HI> FATHERS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with reluctance that I now pre&s;ent my&s;elf to public view, as an organ by which the feelings of this a&s;&s;embly are to be expre&s;&s;ed, under the mo&s;t afflicting di&s;pen&s;ation; But, in a full belief of your candour, I &s;urmount every embarra&s;&s;ment.</P>
<P><HI>Fellow-Citizens,</HI></P>
<P>Advi&s;ed by the General Government, and urg|ed by our own feelings, we have met, to comme|morate the <HI>Life,</HI> the <HI>Acts,</HI> and the DEATH, of the Man, who has been the mo&s;t luminous &s;tar which has ever &s;hone in the American Field, or Councils: He has, with propriety, been &s;tyled, <HI>"the fir&s;t in war, the fir&s;t in peace, and the fir&s;t in the hearts of his countrymen."</HI> Many &s;ons of America have done well;&mdash;but, the illu&s;trious, the mo&s;t excellent WASHINGTON, has excelled them all. John Bapti&s;t was, in a &s;piritual point of view, <HI>"a burning and a &s;hining light."</HI> The beloved Man, who&s;e Death we deplore, has, in a political point of view,
<PB N="6" REF="037723_0003_100EF7463B1CEF40">
done the &s;ame. He has burnt and &s;hone in our po|litical heavens, until the chains of &s;lavery and the clouds of de&s;poti&s;m have been de&s;troyed, and Lib|erty and heaven-born Freedom, with all their con|comitant ble&s;&s;ings, are here enjoyed. There is not a &s;on or daughter of America, who does not enjoy many ble&s;&s;ings, more precious than rubies, which re&s;ult from the magnanimous conduct of the belov|ed Man, whom relentle&s;s death has torn from our weeping eyes, and bleeding hearts. Such have been the valor and firmne&s;s which he has di&s;played in be|half of his Country, that, &s;hould not his name and character receive monumental honors, they will yet live and flouri&s;h, being written in indelible characters on the human heart. Parents will teach their children the great things which God has brought to pa&s;s by the hand of WASHINGTON&mdash; and generations yet unborn, will ri&s;e up and call him ble&s;&s;ed; and &s;peak of him, as a precious gift of God to his beloved Country.</P>
<P>America &s;eems to have been marked out, by God him&s;elf, as a place where to be&s;tow his glori|ous goodne&s;s, in the communication of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;|ings which are &s;uited to the &s;ocial and civil &s;tate of man; particularly liberty and freedom.</P>
<P>At the time of the fir&s;t di&s;covery of the Ameri|can Continent, tyranny, and the galling &s;hackles of &s;lavery, had obtained their empire over almo&s;t all the nations of the Ea&s;tern world. Our Fore-Fathers

&s;eeing this; and having, at the &s;ame time, an ar|dent thir&s;t for the rights of man, both civil and re|ligious, left their native &s;hores, and cro&s;&s;ed the broad Atlantic, to &s;eek, in this new world, a place for the enjoyment of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings which were denied them at home. God crowned the enter|prize with &s;ucce&s;s. Our fathers reached this de|&s;ired haven. And, from that time to the pre&s;ent, the interpo&s;itions of Heaven, in favour of our coun|try, have a&s;toni&s;hed many of the human race. <HI>"The ends of the earth"</HI> heard, <HI>"drew near, and came."</HI> We may, with propriety, adopt the words of the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>"Thou ha&s;t done great things for us, where|of we are glad."</HI></P>
<P>After our Ance&s;tors had, for &s;ome time, enjoy|ed tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, for which they hazarded their lives, hell &s;tirred our mother country to adopt tho&s;e mea&s;ures, with re&s;pect to Infant America, which breathed the mo&s;t unnatural affection, and were calculated to de&s;troy the tender ties of habit, faith, and blood. In this alarming and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing cri&s;is, America placed her&s;elf in a po&s;ition, which a&s;ton|i&s;hed the nations of the earth. She, who was weak in numbers, weak in money, and &s;till weaker in military di&s;cipline, told her veteran, her unnatural foe, that &s;he would be free, or die.</P>
<P>When ho&s;tilities were commencing, the grand que&s;tion was, Who &s;hall command the &s;ons of Co|lumbia, and lead them in the awful conte&s;t? Our
<PB N="8" REF="037723_0005_100EF749995B12D8">
enemies, undoubtedly, thought there were none of her native &s;ons who&s;e abilities were adequate to &s;o important a ta&s;k. But, lo! Heaven had de&s;ignated the MAN, whom it had in&s;pired with wi&s;dom, in|tegrity and fortitude, equal to the undertaking:&mdash; And, at the call of his country, WASHINGTON came forth; and, with all the diffidence of a man of &s;en&s;e and merit, took upon him the important charge. During eight years &s;ervice, the mo&s;t fa|tiguing and di&s;couraging, being &s;ubjected to many incidents which rarely happen in other countries, he di&s;played an almo&s;t unexampled vigor, heroi&s;m, and firm attachment to his country.</P>
<P>During the war, money grew &s;carce; the &s;ol|diers were poorly paid, and con&s;equently became mutinous: the ravages of the enemy were intoler|able; and many times it &s;eemed as though tyranny mu&s;t triumph. The&s;e di&s;a&s;ters hung, like a thick cloud, on almo&s;t every American mind, and &s;eem|ed to forebode immediate de&s;truction. But, under the&s;e weighty trials and di&s;couraging omens, our HERO exhibited a calmne&s;s and fortitude peculiar to his almo&s;t unequalled &s;oul. His enemies, from time to time, felt the weight of his potent arm; while all tho&s;e who fell into his hands experienced the benignity and benevolence of his heart. On the one hand, he exerci&s;ed &s;trict &s;everity, when his country's good required it; while, on the other, he di&s;covered great compa&s;&s;ion when it was con&s;i&s;t|ent with duty and honour.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="037723_0006_100EF74C4EA918F8">General WASHINGTON, although highly exalted in the &s;cale of honour, viewed him&s;elf as the companion of Men, and not of Angels; and therefore always di&s;covered the greate&s;t &s;ympathy for his &s;uffering &s;oldiers, as many of them can this day bear te&s;timony. In but a very few men has &s;uch angelic mildne&s;s dwelt, with &s;uch high authority and power. If we &s;earch the records of antiquity, we &s;hall find the names of many who could boa&s;t of conque&s;t and victory; but, &s;till, in them the be&s;t part of man &s;eems to be lacking; for, while they could, on the one hand, boa&s;t of rival&s;hip, they could not, on the other, boa&s;t of clemency, and of &s;acrificing individual good to general happine&s;s.&mdash; But the latter of the&s;e has &s;hone, with the mo&s;t con|&s;picuous lu&s;tre, in America's deare&s;t friend. If we view him, and trace his &s;teps, from Braddock's de|feat, till the &s;urrender of Cornwallis, his character does not &s;uffer by a compari&s;on with any General, either of ancient or modern date, who has trodden the field of battle. He was neither elated with pro&s;|perity, nor di&s;heartened by adver&s;ity; but was en|abled to pre&s;erve that equanimity, which is highly nece&s;&s;ary and important for tho&s;e, on who&s;e &s;houl|ders the great concerns of a nation re&s;t.</P>
<P>After WASHINGTON had conducted Ame|rica, through a long and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing war, under God, to a &s;tate of freedom and renown; after he had rai&s;ed her to that exalted rank which &s;he now holds
<PB N="10" REF="037723_0007_100EF74E308DA830">
among the nations of the earth, having rolled the glorious ear of freedom over the necks of tyrants and oppre&s;&s;ors, and placed the oppre&s;&s;ed under the Olive-Tree of Liberty, he retired from the field of battle with the grateful thanks and be&s;t wi&s;hes of millions, and re&s;igned up his commi&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e from whom he had received it. At this time, he met a band of illu&s;trious Councillors, and they rejoiced together, that the au&s;picious day had arrived which terminated the bloody conte&s;t in favour of America.</P>
<P>Our beloved WASHINGTON, and faithful General, having thus obtained the laurels of victo|ry, ha&s;ted from the field of war and din of arms, to Mount Vernon, there to enjoy, in calm retreat, the ble&s;&s;ings of dome&s;tic life, which were ju&s;tly due to a man who had done &s;o much to &s;ecure them to others. But he did not long enjoy that repo&s;e, and freedom from anxiety, which perhaps would have been more con&s;onant with his de&s;ires. He was &s;oon called to take upon him the office of Chief Magi&s;trate of the United States. Having led the American &s;ons in the field of war, he is now called to lead in the Grand Council of the Nation, a ta&s;k perhaps no le&s;s difficult than any he had yet under|taken, con&s;idering the then pre&s;ent &s;ituation of our nation Independence, our primary object, was indeed gained; but we began to feel all the mi&s;e|ries which a reduction of paper currency, want of money, lo&s;s of credit, contentions between differ|ent
<PB N="11" REF="037723_0008_100EF74FB6826820">
States, and the want of a wi&s;e, uniting Con&s;titu|tion, could produce. For any other man to have taken the important po&s;t of Pre&s;ident, at this alarm|ing cri&s;is, mu&s;t have been entirely fruitle&s;s. He, who had &s;erved his country during eight revolving years; he, in whom the affection and entire confi|dence of all harmoniou&s;ly centred, was the Man, and on him the important office was conferred:&mdash; And the event evinced the wi&s;dom of the choice. He, together with his co-patriots, devi&s;ed, execut|ed, and pre&s;ented to the world, a Con&s;titution, in which the wi&s;dom of man &s;hines con&s;picuou&s;ly, and by which the &s;everal States are &s;o wi&s;ely and clo&s;ely united, as that we hope they will continue one and indivi&s;ible till the laws of gravitation fail, and the kingdoms of the earth are buried in undi&s;tingui&s;h|able ruin.</P>
<P>During eight years in the Chair of Government, to which he was rai&s;ed by the voice of millions of freemen, WASHINGTON di&s;played va&s;t know|ledge in politics, and almo&s;t unequalled &s;kill in go|verning. His authority borrowed the mild gui&s;e of paternal affection and care; and, in this way, his character became complete. After having guided the political <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ar of America, for eight years, he refu&s;ed to be con&s;idered among the candidates for a new election, when in higher e&s;teem than ever in the minds of his countrymen, and once more ha&s;t|ed to the &s;hades of retirement, with the ble&s;&s;ing of
<PB N="12" REF="037723_0009_100EF7519B9A5C48">
millions upon his hoary and honourable head, the be&s;t reward that a lover of his Country can receive. The Valedictory Addre&s;s of our departed Friend to his beloved Country, is a precious political Lega|cy: and will God grant, that it may be pre&s;erved, and wi&s;ely and faithfully regarded, until the king|doms of this world become the united Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>There were none, perhaps, who thought, that the man who had &s;erved his country forty years, would again be called on to re&s;ume his public toils in the decline of life, with his &s;ilvered locks: But the French having commenced ho&s;tilities again&s;t us, the means of defence became nece&s;&s;ary. For this purpo&s;e, an army was rai&s;ed, and he, who&s;e name was like a Ho&s;t, was invited to take the com|mand: And no &s;ooner did our much beloved Fa|ther receive the invitation, than he complied with the reque&s;t, and the &s;ons of Columbia exulted with joy. But when we con&s;ider his advanced age, his great achievements in the American Field and Le|gi&s;lature, his having gained the &s;ummit of human greatne&s;s; and when we likewi&s;e con&s;ider, that a mind &s;o great mu&s;t have been &s;en&s;ible, that a very few circum&s;tances in combination might overthrow all his popularity, and bring a cloud on all his for|mer greatne&s;s; I &s;ay, when we &s;ee him accept the office under the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary con&s;iderations, we are con&s;trained to &s;ay, it was not for money, or honour,
<PB N="13" REF="037723_0010_100EF753D8E55A20">
but from real love to his country, that induced him to the undertaking. This was an action, which di&s;|played &s;uch virtue and benevolence as are rarely found in man: Yea, &s;uch was the parental care manife&s;ted in this, that it &s;eemed to crown all the other actions of his life with a glory which equals the re&s;plendent beams of the &s;un; and almo&s;t pre|&s;aged, that a man &s;o good mu&s;t &s;oon leave the the|atre of mortality&mdash;And &s;o was the event; for on the 14th of December, 1799, he who was the cha|riot of America, and the hor&s;emen thereof, re&s;ign|ed his u&s;eful life, and pa&s;&s;ed the dark vale of death; which proves him to have been a &s;on of Adam, and a fallen creature.</P>
<Q><L>Pale Death, from whom there's none may &s;eek relief,</L>
<L>To Vernon rode, and vi&s;ited our Chief;</L>
<L>The combat &s;oon began&mdash;Death's arrows reach'd his heart;</L>
<L>Alas! <HI>America</HI> and WASHINGTON mu&s;t part.</L></Q>
<P>Here let us pau&s;e for a moment, and admire the hand which pre&s;erved the Father of our Country in the field of battle, amid the thunder of cannon and &s;howers of flying balls, that he might die on his own bed, being ble&s;&s;ed with the tears of his worthy Con&s;ort, and many dome&s;tic friends, which in &s;ome mea&s;ure alleviated the di&s;tre&s;s of &s;ickne&s;s, and ea&s;|ed the pains of death.</P>
<P>But, perhaps &s;ome are ready to conclude, that the &s;peaker, in viewing our deliverances, looks no higher than men and means. But, my friends, of &s;uch &s;tupidity I wi&s;h not to be guilty. There is a
<PB N="14" REF="037723_0011_100EF755B67D8DF0">
God on high, who ruleth in the kingdoms of the earth, &s;etting up one, and putting down another, ac|cording to his infinite plea&s;ure. <HI>This</HI> God, from eternity, decreed the pro&s;perity of America; and all the in&s;truments, requi&s;ite to accompli&s;h it, were written in the book of his eternal purpo&s;es: And, among the many in&s;truments u&s;ed by God for the accompli&s;hment of his purpo&s;e with re&s;pect to America, the excellent WASHINGTON &s;eems to have been the chief. Thanks to God for &s;uch a rich and noble ble&s;&s;ing. And while I &s;peak of the noble talents of our departed Friend, &s;o wonderful|ly exerted in favour of the human race, I would avail my&s;elf of it, as an argument to enforce the importance of the mo&s;t profound reverence and re|&s;pect to that Being, who knows perfectly well what in&s;truments are nece&s;&s;ary and adapted to the accom|pli&s;hment of any glorious object. To &s;peak re|&s;pectfully of any finite being or object, is con&s;i&s;t|ent with &s;upreme love to God. To &s;ay, that the Sun is the great illuminator of the world, the arbi|trator of time, and that which cau&s;eth the womb of nature to bring forth, would be con&s;i&s;tent with de|votion to God; but to &s;ay, that it &s;hines with un|borrowed lu&s;tre, would be highly bla&s;phemous.&mdash; So, to &s;ay, that the beloved WASHINGTON has been exten&s;ively u&s;eful to the world, and particu|larly to United America, is con&s;i&s;tent with the mo&s;t religious belief in Divine Providence; but to &s;ay,
<PB N="15" REF="037723_0012_100EF757413599D0">
that his life, his talents, and his virtues, were not from God, mu&s;t argue the greate&s;t &s;tupidity.</P>
<P>In view of our National lo&s;s, the following things naturally &s;trike the mind:</P>
<P N="1">1. That it will either tend to greater internal di&s;cord, and external commotion; or, to greater internal harmony, and of cour&s;e to greater exter|nal peace. God grant, that it may be the latter&mdash; And to this end, let each of us live, let each of us pray.</P>
<P N="2">2. This lo&s;s reminds us, that all &s;ublunary things mu&s;t fail us; and particularly, that <HI>Death</HI> is an arti|cle in the creed of the univer&s;al progeny of Adam, the principles of di&s;&s;olution being fixed in all the works of nature. The tall, the wi&s;e, the reverend head, mu&s;t not only ta&s;te, but drink the bitter cup. Could the univer&s;al e&s;teem of mankind, the warm|e&s;t affections of millions, and the prayers of Saints, have &s;aved our Friend, he would not have died;&mdash;&mdash; but&punc; alas! when God's time had come, it was not po&s;&s;ible for all the&s;e to hold him, or protract his life, a moment. It is appointed unto man once to die, and after this the judgment. May we all prepare for the grand a&s;&s;ize&mdash;for the midnight cry.</P>
<P N="3">3. We have rea&s;on to ble&s;s God, that he rai&s;ed up for us &s;uch a glorious deliverer; that he direct|ed his talents to the happine&s;s of his country; and that he pre&s;erved his life, and continued his u&s;eful|ne&s;s, to &s;o great an age.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="16" REF="037723_0013_100EF759D3226060">4. By this &s;troke of the righteous judgment of God upon us, as a nation, we are reminded of the obligation we are under, of gratitude and thanks to Jehovah, that he has given another to &s;it at the Helm of our National Admini&s;tration, in whom wi&s;dom and virtue &s;hine with unblemi&s;hed lu&s;tre.&mdash; May ADAMS as nearly equal WASHINGTON in the grand Council of our Nation, as Jo&s;hua did Mo&s;es in the camp of I&s;rael. May America ever be ble&s;&s;|ed with wi&s;e Governors and Legi&s;lators, until HE who&s;e right it is &s;hall come and reign, by the pow|er of his grace, in the hearts of all men, <HI>"from &s;ea even to &s;ea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth."</HI> In that day, union will be &s;piritual and uni|ver&s;al&mdash;the law and con&s;titution, Divine&mdash;and the Governor, THE MIGHTY GOD, THE EVERLAST|ING FATHER, THE PRINCE OF PEACE.</P>
