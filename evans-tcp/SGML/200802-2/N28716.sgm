<HEAD>CHARACTER OF THIS WORK. From the CRITICAL REVIEW, Vol. XVI. page <HI>221.</HI></HEAD>
<P>"Among the many novels with which the pre&s;s is every day &s;warming, we are happy, when able, to &s;e|lect a few, which afford amu&s;ement without endan|gering the morals, and in&s;truction without the dull|ne&s;s of con&s;tant morali&s;ing. Of this number is An|toinette.</P>
<P>"The title, however, &s;hould not lead our readers to &s;uppo&s;e that this publication is of a political character. It has not the lea&s;t reference to the affairs of France; and for this rea&s;on we could have wi&s;hed it had ap|peared under another name: the pre&s;ent is apt to mi&s;lead readers.</P>
<P>"The heroine is the daughter of a nobleman of the ancient family of the Percivals, barons of Arlington, that occupied Arlington ca&s;tle, on the we&s;tern &s;ide of the lake of Killarney, in Ireland. The principal incidents of the hi&s;tory pa&s;s in that picture&s;que and beautiful &s;pot.</P>
<P>"Antoinette is the daughter of lord Arlington, by his fir&s;t wife; &s;everal circum&s;tances, for a long time my&s;terious and inexplicable, relating to the parents of the young lady, form a principal part of the plot, in the unravelling of which, con&s;iderable ingenuity is di&s;covered. In the character of lord Arlington we contemplate tho&s;e generous virtues that throw a lu&s;tre on exalted &s;tations; and in lady Arlington we view a &s;en&s;ible female, who thinks the principal excellence of her &s;ex con&s;i&s;ts in the cultivation of her under|&s;tanding, and in an attention to her children. Both the&s;e characters, and indeed mo&s;t of the others, are well drawn; though we think lady Arlington bears the
<PB N="ii" REF="038283_0002_101188F0A9FC98A0">
ab&s;ence of her hu&s;band rather too &s;toically, and &s;everal incidents are too ha&s;tily run over, particularly &s;uch as mu&s;t have occurred during the lady's re&s;idence in London, a de&s;cription of which would have afforded a degree of variety in the work.</P>
<P>"The morality is unexceptionably pure; the princi|ples are liberal; the reader is led on gradually to events intere&s;ting and &s;triking; the language is in the main neat and correct, and the i&s;&s;ue of the hi&s;tory fortunate and agreeable. On the whole, this novel has con&s;iderable merit; and we think the writer might di&s;play her powers of de&s;cription a little more freely.</P>
<P>"The latter hint we drop, becau&s;e we under&s;tand this is the production of a lady, who is likely to favour the world with another novel &s;hortly, and becau&s;e we think the public will receive Antoinette as a fa|vourable &s;pecimen of her abilities."</P>

<P>ON the we&s;tern &s;ide of the lake of Killarney, be|tween that noble expan&s;e of waters and the Atlantic ocean, &s;tood Arlington ca&s;tle, the &s;eat of the ancient family of the Percivals, barons of Arlington. The hou&s;e was &s;ituated on the declivity of a hill, and the front being to the &s;outh we&s;t, commanded a view of the ocean, with the Skelig I&s;les in the horizon. The &s;pace between the hou&s;e and the &s;ea was a continued land&s;cape of lawns and woods, or rather &s;hrubberies, for they were only of a &s;tature to diver&s;ify and adorn the pro&s;pect, not to interrupt it. From another part of the hou&s;e were &s;een the beautiful lakes of Killarney, with the mountain of Mange<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on on the other &s;ide of them, forming a &s;cene not le&s;s grand than picture&s;que. On the whole, perhaps, a more romantic or beautiful &s;pot could not be formed by the mo&s;t luxuriant ima|gination.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="038283_0005_101188F777C40810">The hou&s;e was &s;pacious, and had formerly been the abode of cheerfulne&s;s and ho&s;pitality; but alas! the halls now no more rang with the mirth of the fe&s;tive board; the gue&s;ts no more a&s;&s;embled round the blazing hearth; nor did a &s;miling pea&s;antry repeat with tran&s;ports the name of their ho&s;pitable landlord. All was &s;ilent in the man&s;ion&mdash;its owners had for|&s;aken it&mdash;they were allured away by the luxuries of the Engli&s;h metropolis, and by the imaginary fame to be acquired by gaining a &s;eat in the Engli&s;h hou&s;e of commons; forgetting that it was not the mere act of &s;itting there, which could ca&s;t a lu&s;tre around their heads; and that, this was only to be obtained by fil|ling the &s;eat worthily; by labouring ince&s;&s;antly to promote the welfare and happine&s;s of tho&s;e, who had deputed them to that &s;tation; and not by &s;itting on the benches as idle &s;pectators and auditors.</P>
<P>Two very expen&s;ive conte&s;ted elections, for the populous town of &mdash;, had made dreadful depre|dations on the fortune of one of the proprietors of Arlington ca&s;tle; &s;o that when it de&s;cended to his &s;on Edward, he found him&s;elf encumbered with an immen&s;e debt, thus fooli&s;hly incurred.</P>
<P>Edward, born and educated in the metropolis of Great Britain, could ill dige&s;t the thoughts of re|turning to live among&s;t the WILD Iri&s;h, as he had al|ways heard them emphatically &s;tiled; and he there|fore determined to try, fir&s;t, whether by prudent ma|nagement in England, he might not be able to re|trieve his affairs, without bani&s;hing him&s;elf from all civilized &s;ociety, which he conceived it would be, to return to his patrimonial inheritance.</P>
<P>Prudence in the choice of a wife, he conceived, would be of the utmo&s;t importance to him, in car|rying his economical plans into execution. For this purpo&s;e, he re&s;olved not to take one from among&s;t the daughters of affluence, who would probably &s;pend three times as much money as &s;he brought him; but to &s;eek out for &s;ome female, who, having been edu|cated
<PB N="7" REF="038283_0006_101188F90D6B39F8">
in habits of economy and retirement, would have no wi&s;h to enter into the expen&s;ive cour&s;e of life, which one born in a more elevated &s;ituation, would naturally be led to expect.</P>
<P>It was not long before he met with a young wo|man, agreeable in her per&s;on, whom he thought ex|actly &s;uited to the plan of life which he had laid down for him&s;elf, to whom therefore, he immediately made his propo&s;als, and was, &s;oon after, married. Mi&s;|taken man! he &s;oon learnt the &s;evere le&s;&s;on, that ig|norance of an irrational cour&s;e of life in her early years is no &s;ecurity for a woman's leading a rational one, when more knowledge of what is called the world, has filled her head with new ideas of the plea|&s;ures to be derived from following the giddy rounds of folly and di&s;&s;ipation, in which &s;he &s;ees thou&s;ands engaged. No; a woman is then mo&s;t likely to per|form her duty properly, when initiated into the follies of the gay world, with a mind accu&s;tomed to rea&s;on on all things; and who, viewing tho&s;e follies, there|fore, with a philo&s;ophic eye, would not prize them too highly, or &s;eek after them too eagerly.</P>
<P>Start not, readers, at the ideas here &s;ugge&s;ted, of a female philo&s;opher. I know it is a character, which the world has been hitherto in the habit of con&s;idering as a &s;ort of eccentricity of nature, very fit to be &s;hown about as a &s;ight, but not to be imitated. But, thanks to the improved &s;tate of knowledge in the&s;e times, we may hope that in a &s;hort time the character will become &s;o common, that it will no longer be looked on as a prodigy, or &s;hunned as a bane, but nouri&s;hed as a plant of the mo&s;t bal&s;amic influence. For let me a&s;k, whether it can &s;eriou&s;ly be &s;uppo&s;ed by any reflecting per&s;on, that a woman will be the le&s;s likely to perform the dome&s;tic duties well, when her mind has been cultivated, and &s;he has been taught to per|form them on principle, and to u&s;e her rea&s;on in the management of her family, than when her whole &s;y&s;tem of action is the re&s;ult of habit only; &s;o that like
<PB N="8" REF="038283_0007_101188FB51F40DD8">
a piece of mere mechani&s;m, &s;hould one wheel be in the lea&s;t deranged, &s;he is utterly at a lo&s;s, and the whole machine immediately becomes confu&s;ion and di&s;|order.</P>
<P>Lord Arlington, at lea&s;t, had &s;oon rea&s;on to repent of the choice he had made; for no &s;ooner did his bride find her&s;elf elvated to a &s;tation, to which, pre|viou&s;ly to her acquaintance with him, &s;he had never even dared to rai&s;e her thoughts, than &s;he launched out into every extravagance, which the intoxication of newly-acquired rank could &s;ugge&s;t to her, without ever pau&s;ing a moment, to con&s;ider whether &s;uch ex|pen&s;es were proper or improper.</P>
<P>Lord Arlington endeavoured, from the fir&s;t dawn|ing of this propen&s;ity to extravagance in his wife, to check its progre&s;s; but alas! in vain; &s;he went on from year to year, growing more profu&s;e, as expen&s;e grew le&s;s proper; 'till, at la&s;t, hurt in his fortune, al|mo&s;t beyond a po&s;&s;ibility of retrieving&mdash;and wounded deeply in his mind with the thoughts of the needy &s;ituation, and con&s;equent ob&s;curity, into which he and his family, mu&s;t be thrown, by the fre&s;h incum|brances which the prodigality of his wife had brought on his before over-burdened e&s;tate, he re&s;olved to make one effort more, before all was lo&s;t; and by re|moving his wife from the &s;cenes with which, and the companions by whom, her attention had, for &s;o long a time, been entirely occupied, to pluck up the evil by the roots, and endeavour to &s;ave a part of his for|tune from the general wreck.</P>
<P>However contrary therefore, to his own inclinations it might be, he determined to retire with his wife and his &s;on Theodore, then about &s;ix years of age, and the only fruit of his ill-&s;tarred union, to Arlington ca&s;tle, there to live in retirement and economy.</P>
<P>But no &s;ooner was this plan &s;ugge&s;ted to lady Ar|lington, than &s;he, who had drunk too deeply of the Circean cup of Briti&s;h di&s;&s;ipation, to be able quietly to relinqui&s;h the intoxicating draught, began to play
<PB REF="038283_0008_101188FCDDFC6058">
off the u&s;ual round of arts, &s;o often &s;ucce&s;sfully prac|ti&s;ed by females, when they wi&s;h to turn a hu&s;band a&s;ide from any purpo&s;e, which may not be plea&s;ing to them.</P>
<P>But it was all in vain. Lord Arlington was re|&s;olved: and he was not of &s;uch a wavering di&s;po&s;i|tion, when once re&s;olved on any thing, as to be ea&s;ily &s;haken in his purpo&s;e; he had, therefore, made a con&s;iderable progre&s;s in &s;ettling his affairs, previou&s;ly to his departure, when his wife, finding all her endea|vours to move him ineffectual, determined to pur&s;ue a plan of her own forming, and eloped with one of tho&s;e kind hearted knights errant, who are always ready to fly to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of females, in lady Ar|lington's di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Lord Arlington immediately &s;ued for, and obtained, without difficulty, a &s;eparation from her in Doctor's Commons; and thus being relieved, though in a painful manner, from this great ob&s;tacle to his eco|nomical plans, and, indeed, as it ultimately turned out, relieved from all expence on his wife's account &mdash;for though a proper maintenance was &s;ettled for her, yet, as &s;he went abroad, and lord Arlington never heard of her more, that allowance was never paid,&mdash;he pur&s;ued with alacrity, the &s;chemes he had formed, and very &s;oon after arrived with his &s;on at Arlington ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>This fir&s;t &s;tep taken, the next was to in&s;titute a &s;trict inquiry into the real &s;tate of his affairs. But in this inve&s;tigation, lord Arlington only found mor|tification ri&s;e on mortification. The more he en|quired into his affairs, the more embarra&s;&s;ed they ap|peared. Every day produced &s;ome fre&s;h mortgage or claim upon him; 'till wearied with chagrin, he had &s;everal times nearly given up the enquiry, and determined to go abroad, as concluding all lo&s;t. At la&s;t, however, by the mo&s;t unwearied per&s;everance, he &s;o far arranged his affairs, and put them into &s;uch a train, as to give rea&s;onable hopes, that if his plans
<PB N="10" REF="038283_0009_101188FED0E7F8F0">
were &s;trictly adhered to, his e&s;tate might, in a cour&s;e of years, be quite freed from all embarra&s;&s;|ment.</P>
<P>The&s;e cares, together with the education of his &s;on, upon which he &s;pared no proper expence,&mdash; wi&s;ely judging, that this was the only branch of ex|pence, wherein a very rigid economy would be im|proper,&mdash;occupied the greate&s;t part of his time during the fir&s;t years of his re&s;idence at Arlington ca&s;tle. He &s;aw little company, only vi&s;iting tho&s;e of his neighbours, who had &s;en&s;e enough to re&s;pect him, for the prudent manner in which he lived. The&s;e, indeed, were few; it being the opinion of much the larger part of the country, that it was degrading to a peer, to live in &s;o economical a manner.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e with whom he principally a&s;&s;ociated, was colonel Conolly, who had a &s;mall e&s;tate, with a pretty hou&s;e on it, at Airville, about four miles from Arlington ca&s;tle. The colonel had acquired a very large fortune in the Ea&s;t-Indies, where he had &s;erved as an officer in the company's army, and was now re|tired to his e&s;tate, to enjoy in peace his large po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions: for, unlike many of tho&s;e who acquire their fortunes in the Ea&s;t-Indies, he could enjoy his in peace, having no qualms of con&s;cience to torment him with the idea of any thing am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s in the acquirement of tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. All was fairly gotten, that is, as far as any thing can be &s;aid to be fairly gotten, which is acquired by the murder of our fellow creatures: for, though murder was his profe&s;&s;ion, yet he had not extented an a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the injury of any one, but in the fair way of that profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>He had married an Engli&s;h woman while he was in India, by whom he had only one child, a daugh|ter; and his wife dying on her pa&s;&s;age to England, he immediately, on his arrival in England, placed his daughter under the care of a relation in London, from whence, at a proper age, &s;he was to be removed to a boarding &s;chool, with a charge that &s;he &s;hould be in|&s;tructed
<PB N="11" REF="038283_0010_101189006822C3D8">
in every thing proper to be taught to the heire&s;s of &s;o large a fortune.</P>
<P>Colonel Conolly was ju&s;t arrived at Airville, when lord Arlington returned to his family &s;eat. An inti|macy &s;oon commenced between them; which the lat|ter was particularly a&s;&s;iduous to cultivate, indulging a &s;ecret hope, that when their re&s;pective children came to be much together, they might entertain a partiality for each other: and that mi&s;s Conolly's fortune might help to di&s;encumber the Arlington e&s;tate.</P>
<P>At &s;ixteen years of age Theodore Percival was &s;ent abroad, under the care of a mr. Lew&s;on, a very wor|thy and re&s;pectable gentleman, with whom he tra|velled through the greate&s;t part of Europe; and was returning by way of France, having &s;o &s;ettled his jour|ney, that in conformity with his father's wi&s;hes, often expre&s;&s;ed in his letters, he &s;hould return to Ireland by the time he was of age; lord Arlington having intented that day to be &s;pent as a day of great fe&s;tivity at the ca&s;tle. His return was, however, &s;omewhat retarded by the death of mr. Lew&s;on, who had been, for &s;ome time, in a very indifferent &s;tate of health, and who, when he arrived at Vienne in Dauphin&eacute;, was taken too ill to be able to proceed on his journey, and, after langui&s;hing &s;ome weeks, died there.</P>
<P>Mr. Percival deeply regretted the lo&s;s of him, as he had in every re&s;pect fulfilled, with the mo&s;t per|fect propriety, the important tru&s;t committed to him. Well a&s;&s;ured, that the mo&s;t effectual method to &s;e|cure his precepts a favourable reception from his young pupil, was, to watch the proper opportunities of in&s;truction, and to mingle, with the utmo&s;t cau|tion and art, amu&s;ement and in&s;truction together; he never threw in an ob&s;ervation mal-a-propos, nor ever attempted to thwart his charge in any innocent plan he had formed for recreation or entertainment; neither did he ever refu&s;e to accompany him on &s;uch occa&s;ions, how much &s;oever he might be di&s;inclined to them him&s;elf. He was, in &s;hort, not only the
<PB N="12" REF="038283_0011_10118902D1AE3308">
tutor, but the friend and companion of Theodore, who in all his letters to his father, bore an ample te&s;timony to his virtues and talents, and at his death lamented, in the mo&s;t pathetic terms, the lo&s;s he had &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>The death of mr. Lew&s;on, however, made lord Arlington more anxious than ever for the return of his &s;on. He wrote him many very pre&s;&s;ing letters on the &s;ubject, in con&s;equence of which, though only two days before he completed his twenty-fir&s;t year, Theo|dore arrived at Arlington ca&s;tle, to the no &s;mall joy of his father, who beheld in him all the improve|ments which his mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes could expect.</P>
<P>In his outward appearance, he was tall, and well made, with a countenance at once hand&s;ome, intelli|gent, and expre&s;&s;ive of a mind liberal and well in|formed, and of the utmo&s;t &s;weetne&s;s of temper; his manners al&s;o were tho&s;e of a perfect gentleman, with|out the lea&s;t tincture of the coxcomb or pedant.</P>
<P>About two years before his return, mi&s;s Conolly had been taken from &s;chool, and placed at the head of her father's hou&s;e. She was mi&s;tre&s;s of all tho&s;e accompli&s;hments, which are denominated genteel; &s;he could dance, &s;ing, play on the piano-forte, talk French and Italian to perfection; &s;he under&s;tood all kinds of work, proper for her &s;tation, and dre&s;&s;ed with ta&s;te and elegance; yet, with all the&s;e accom|pli&s;hments, and with a face and per&s;on, which were both much admired, &s;he was quite free from affecta|tion and coquetry. One thing only was wanting to make her completely amiable; but, perhaps, one worth all the acquirements &s;he had attained, and that was, a ta&s;te for reading and intellectual improve|ments; but to have acquired that ta&s;te in the man|ner in which &s;he had been educated, was not to be expected, and &s;till le&s;s could it be expected, that &s;he would acquire it at her father's hou&s;e, who him&s;elf con&s;idered reading as not at all a feminine employ|ment.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="038283_0012_10118905DC67F900">Such were Theodore Percival and Horatia Conolly, at the time of the former's return from his travels, previou&s;ly to which event, lord Arlington had, at a di&s;tance, founded the &s;entiments of mr. Conolly, on the &s;ubject of the union, which he &s;o much wi&s;hed for; and having rea&s;on to think, that he would not be aver&s;e to it, he came at once to the point, and propo&s;ed to him, that they &s;hould endeavour to for|ward the plan with all the intere&s;t they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in their re&s;pective children. Mr. Conolly, who&s;e only object in the di&s;po&s;al of his daughter, was rank, as her fortune would be &s;ufficient to &s;upport any rank, readily a&s;&s;ented to lord Arlington's &s;cheme: and it was agreed between the&s;e two fathers, that at mr. Percival's return, the young people &s;hould be thrown as much as po&s;&s;ible in each other's way, and every fair means taken, to create in them an attachment to each other.</P>

<P>FROM the moment when this agreement was made between the fathers, which was &s;ome months before Theodore's return, lord Arlington almo&s;t lived at colonel Conolly's, in order that the views of the parents might be the better veiled from the young
<PB N="14" REF="038283_0013_1011890824FC4EB8">
people, who if a &s;udden increa&s;e of intimacy had taken place immediately after Theodore's return, might have been led to &s;u&s;pect that it was not without de|&s;ign; for colonel Conolly and lord Arlington both agreed, that if it &s;hould come to be &s;u&s;pected by their children, that they had formed the &s;cheme we have related, it might at once put an end to all hopes of its &s;ucceeding: for young people &s;eldom revolt at any thing &s;o much as the idea that they are de&s;ignedly thrown in each other's way, in order to accompli&s;h the &s;chemes of their parents. But as &s;carcely a day pa&s;&s;ed without &s;ome intercour&s;e between the families of lord Arlington and colonel Conolly, for weeks be|fore mr. Percival's return, the frequent vi&s;its which they intended &s;hould take place afterwards, would not appear to have any particular de&s;ign in them.</P>
<P>At length the day &s;o much wi&s;hed for by lord Ar|lington&punc; arrived, and after an ab&s;ence of five years, he again cla&s;ped in his arms a &s;on, for whom he had &s;uffered &s;o much anxiety, and to whom he looked up, as the future ornament of his ancient fa|mily. The very &s;ame day this dear &s;on was intro|duced by his father, with eyes &s;parkling with joy and hope, to colonel and mi&s;s Conolly, who &s;eemed &s;carcely le&s;s charmed with him, than the enraptured lord Arlington him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Yet amid&s;t all the delight which his pre&s;ence &s;eemed to diffu&s;e around him, and the real plea&s;ure which he him&s;elf felt, at again &s;eeing a parent, to whom he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o many obligations, Theodore was at times thoughtful and re&s;erved; it is true, he endea|voured to wear a ma&s;k of gaiety, and returned, with an irre&s;i&s;tible grace and elegance, the compliments paid him on his return; but it was apparent, not|with&s;tanding, that his gaiety was but a ma&s;k, and that thoughtfulne&s;s and re&s;erve were the natural in|mates of his brea&s;t.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Conolly was as much plea&s;ed with mr. Perci|val, as the mo&s;t &s;anguine wi&s;hes of her father could
<PB N="15" REF="038283_0014_10118909CEA0A8D0">
a&s;pire to; but as to mr. Percival, it was, alas, but too evident, that mi&s;s Conolly's charms made no im|pre&s;&s;ion on his (as his father at once determined it to be) in&s;en&s;ible heart.</P>
<P>Lord Arlington, on leaving the colonel's was re|que&s;ted by him to dine at Airville the next day, an invitation which he mo&s;t joyfully accepted, but which his &s;on, though he replied to it with perfect polite|ne&s;s, too plainly wi&s;hed he could have declined. In their way home, lord Arlington addre&s;&s;ed his &s;on,</P>
<P>'Well, my Theodore, and what do you think of mi&s;s Conolly?'</P>
<P>'She is a fine woman?'</P>
<P>'Aye, a charming woman, is &s;he not?'</P>
<P>'I don't doubt but &s;he is; but one cannot form any opinion of a woman at fir&s;t &s;ight.'</P>
<P>'Oh, you cannot fail to be charmed with her, when you are more acquainted with her.'</P>
<P>'Perhaps, then, 'twere be&s;t to &s;hun her, if &s;he is &s;o very dangerous.'</P>
<P>'Oh, by no means, cowards only fly from dan|ger; the brave are ever mo&s;t forward to face it.'</P>
<P>'It is true, that the brave will face it with firm|ne&s;s, when it mu&s;t be met; but it is ra&s;hne&s;s alone that will &s;eek it unnece&s;&s;arily. However, to be ho|ne&s;t, my dear &s;ir, I do not think that there is any thing &s;o very dangerous in mi&s;s Conolly's eyes, but that one may encounter their glances, without incur|ring the imputation of ra&s;hne&s;s.'</P>
<P>Lord Arlington felt a little chagrined at this ob&s;er|vation, but made no reply. However, he con&s;oled him&s;elf with the reflection, that impre&s;&s;ions made at fir&s;t &s;ight, are not always the mo&s;t la&s;ting, and re&s;ted on the hope that mi&s;s Conolly's accompli&s;hments, when they came to be known to his &s;on, might work the effect, which her eyes had failed of.</P>
<P>After &s;upper, lord Arlington could not help ob&s;erv|ing his &s;on's gravity, &s;aying, half in je&s;t and half &s;eri|ou&s;ly,</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="038283_0015_1011890CC4611030">'Indeed, my Theodore, you are &s;o &s;erious that one would think you had left your heart behind you: you u&s;ed to be all life and &s;pirits before you went away: I &s;hall begin to hate foreign countries, if they have deprived me of the chearful companion I was &s;o long accu&s;tomed to.'</P>
<P>'Indeed, I beg your pardon, &s;ir, a thou&s;and times,' an&s;wered Theodore, 'I own it is very wrong, after &s;o long an ab&s;ence from &s;uch a kind and affec|tionate parent, to meet him at my return, with a clouded brow: but though ble&s;t in the living, a pang will &s;ometimes ari&s;e for the dead; and recollect, &s;ir, what a friend I have lately lo&s;t, and how much every object here reminds me of him; nor blame me if a cloud now and then appears, to break the &s;un&s;hine which ought to beam on my countenance.'</P>
<P>''Tis true, indeed, my &s;on,' an&s;wered lord Ar|lington, and I no longer wonder at, or blame the &s;orrow you appear to feel. Mr. Lew&s;on was worthy of every re&s;pect you can &s;hew him; and not deeply to feel his lo&s;s, would be brutal indeed in you, who owe him &s;o much.'</P>
<P>Lord Arlington, indeed, &s;ecretly rejoiced to hear his &s;on's appearance of gravity and thoughtfulne&s;s &s;o well accounted for. He had him&s;elf, though fully &s;en&s;ible of Mr. Lew&s;on's merit, and the obligations which he owed him, &s;o lo&s;t in the fir&s;t joy of &s;eeing his &s;on, all recollection of the lo&s;s of that valuable friend, that it never once occurred to him, that his &s;on had that cau&s;e of &s;orrow. But he no &s;ooner heard it mentioned, than he immediately felt the full force of his remarks, and wondered not that Theodore, who had for &s;o long a time been his con&s;tant compa|nion, and had gone through the painful &s;cene of attending him in a long illne&s;s, which he &s;aw him at la&s;t finally &s;ink u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hould deeply feel what could not, from a differen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of circum&s;tances, make the like impre&s;&s;ion on his own mind.</P>
<P>Theodore, however, felt this reproof of his father's
<PB N="17" REF="038283_0016_1011890E5007CE38">
deeply, and re&s;olved, that nothing more of this melan|choly &s;hould, if po&s;&s;ible, appear. The next day, therefore, at colonel Conolly's, he was much le&s;s re|&s;erved, than on the former occa&s;ion; he was perfectly ea&s;y and polite&mdash;talked much of foreign countries, their manners and cu&s;toms&mdash;entertained the com|pany with many anecdotes of hie travels, and, in &s;hort, was quite the hero of the circle.</P>
<P>Horatia was charmed with him; &s;he &s;ung and played; &s;he exhibited &s;pecimens of her talents in drawing and painting; &s;he talked of London, and the beau monde; but Theodore was in&s;en&s;ible to all her attractions, though perfectly polite to her. On the whole the day pa&s;&s;ed off plea&s;antly; and at parting in the evening, lord Arlington reminded the colonel and his daughter of the fe&s;tival which was to take place at Arlington the next day, when his &s;on would be twen|ty-one years of age, and which mr. and mi&s;s Conolly both &s;aid they enjoyed too much in idea, to have wanted to be reminded of.</P>
<P>Great preparations had been making for &s;ome time, for the celebration of this day; the rooms, which from the de&s;ertion of the hou&s;e by his ance&s;tors, and from the retired plan of life which lord Arlington him&s;elf had adopted, had been &s;hut up for many years, were now opened, having been repaired and decorated for the occa&s;ion; not that by a fooli&s;h and wanton extravagance, lord Arlington, meant now to undo all that years of prudence had been accom|pli&s;hing. The fe&s;tivity was conducted at the &s;ame time with economy and ho&s;pitality. Nothing gaudy or frivolous was mixed with it; but every thing was good of its kind, and &s;erved in plenty, without pro|fu&s;ion.</P>
<P>A mo&s;t elegant dinner, a concert, with a ball and &s;upper, were &s;erved within the hou&s;e, attended by the nobility and gentry for many miles round. Without the hou&s;e, an ox was roa&s;ted whole, with plenty of other beef, pies, plumb puddings, ale and punch, for
<PB N="18" REF="038283_0017_10118910DA74FEB8">
the tenants, both farmers and pea&s;antry, men, women, and children; and in the evening there was a di&s;play of very fine fire-works, with rural mu&s;ic, and a dance upon the green.</P>
<P>The whole was a &s;cene of elegance and chearful|ne&s;s, of jollity and ho&s;pitality; and was conducted with the utmo&s;t regularity and order: nor did one untoward circum&s;tance intervene during the whole of the entertainment.</P>
<P>Mr. Percival, on who&s;e account it was given, was pre&s;ent in every place by turns, and was alike admired wherever he went; he was no le&s;s ea&s;y among the company without doors, than among&s;t tho&s;e within; he ate &s;ome of the ox with them; drank health and happine&s;s to them all; joined with them in their dance, and while he continued with them was as one of them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Nor was his elegance of manners a le&s;s &s;ource of admiration to the company within doors; he charmed them all, and it was with peculiar plea&s;ure that lord Arlington and colonel Conolly both ob&s;erved, that Horatia was not among&s;t the number of tho&s;e who were the lea&s;t &s;en&s;ible to his attractions. In fact, &s;he that day completely lo&s;t her heart; it became wholly and &s;olely mr. Percival's. But the love &s;till remained entirely on her &s;ide: though &s;he was dre&s;&s;ed to the be&s;t advantage, though &s;he danced to perfection, and was allowed by all pre&s;ent, to be the fine&s;t woman in the room, &s;he was not at all the particular object of Theodore's attentions, &s;he came in for no more of them than her &s;hare in common with the re&s;t of the company.</P>
<P>Lord Arlington ob&s;erved this indifference of his &s;on's with the deepe&s;t regret: a regret, which time only increa&s;ed, in&s;tead of dimini&s;hing; for time only &s;hewed more and more plainly, how little pro&s;pect there was of Theodore ever voluntarily fixing on Ho|ratia in his choice of a wife. And this regret, which was felt &s;o deeply by lord Arlington, was doubled in
<PB N="19" REF="038283_0018_10118912976931D0">
the heart of colonel Conolly; as it became every day more apparent, how much his daughter's affections were engaged to a man, who repaid them with per|fect indifference; and appeared, indeed, as much as po&s;&s;ible to &s;hun her. This, indeed, was but too true. Theodore &s;oon perceived what the aim of both pa|rents was; and as he had no inclination to comply with their wi&s;hes, he thought it the mo&s;t honourable mode of proceeding, to avoid the lady whenever he could do &s;o, without being guilty of incivility.</P>
<P>Eight months had elap&s;ed thus, mr. Percival at &s;ome times appearing quite thoughtful and melan|choly, at others ea&s;y and chearful; when lord Ar|lington growing impatient of delay, determined to lay open his mind to his &s;on. He called him, there|fore, one day into his &s;tudy, and thus addre&s;&s;ed him:</P>
<P>'My deare&s;t &s;on, it is my mo&s;t earne&s;t wi&s;h to &s;ee you well &s;ettled in life; nor could any thing, I think, be more de&s;irable for you, than an union be|tween your family, and that of colonel Conolly, by a marriage with his daughter. She is a very amiable and accompli&s;hed woman, to whom you cannot po&s;|&s;ibly make any objection, and her fortune is beyond what your mo&s;t &s;anguine wi&s;hes could have dared to think of. I have &s;ounded the colonel's &s;entiments on the &s;ubject, and though he might have formed much higher views for his daughter, yet he is content, he kindly &s;ays, to wave all other con&s;iderations, in the happine&s;s he &s;hould feel at be&s;towing his daughter on a man of your worth and accompli&s;hments. I hope therefore you will rai&s;e no ob&s;tacle to an union, which would give &s;o much &s;atisfaction to all parties.'</P>
<P>Theodore heard his father out, without attempt|ing to interrupt him; but being well aware, that &s;uch a propo&s;al was likely to be made to him, he was prepared with his an&s;wer, and replied with a calm but firm tone, as follows:</P>
<P>'I am perfectly &s;en&s;ible, my deare&s;t father, of your kind intentions towards me, in the alliance you
<PB N="20" REF="038283_0019_10118914E07733F8">
propo&s;e. I am perfectly &s;en&s;ible too, of the merits of mi&s;s Conolly, and of the honour done me by her father; but indeed, dear &s;ir, I mu&s;t entreat of you not to think of pre&s;&s;ing this match any farther. I am &s;ure mi&s;s Conolly is not a woman with whom I could ever be perfectly happy. She is, though amiable in her di&s;po&s;ition, uncultivated, except in tho&s;e &s;howy accompli&s;hments, which may, indeed, attract the &s;en&s;es, but never can find their way to the heart; and though &s;he may pa&s;s off very well as an a&s;&s;ociate for an afternoon, &s;he mu&s;t be an in&s;ipid and unintere&s;ting companion for life; nor can I ever con&s;ent to an union, which I am &s;ure would make me mi&s;erable.'</P>
<P>Lord Arlington was &s;ufficiently chagrined at the firm and decided manner in which his &s;on declared his di&s;approbation of a mea&s;ure, which he had &s;o much at heart to accompli&s;h; unwilling, however, totally to give up this darling project, he often urged it on his &s;on, alleging to him not only the recom|mendations of the lady her&s;elf, which he thought &s;uf|ficient to &s;atisfy any man; but that, added to the&s;e, &s;he would bring him a fortune which would entirely clear his &s;till encumbered e&s;tate; and was, there|fore, in that light al&s;o, a mo&s;t de&s;irable match for him.</P>
<P>Theodore, however, continued firm, often repeat|ing to his father, that he could e&s;teem mi&s;s Conolly, but never could love her; and that no happine&s;s could be experienced in the marriage &s;tate without an ar|dent affection on both &s;ides.</P>
<P>Lord Arlington could not deny the force of this objection; but &s;trove to parry it, by urging that e&s;|teem was the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible foundation for love, and that if he &s;hould marry mi&s;s Conolly, he did not doubt but love would &s;oon be added to e&s;teem. But all was in vain. Theodore &s;eemed re&s;olutely deter|mined not to con&s;ent to the match. He grew, too, almo&s;t daily, more thoughtful and melancholy, 'till at la&s;t his father, who, as we have already &s;aid, was
<PB N="21" REF="038283_0020_10118917E4C6D738">
not ea&s;ily to be turned a&s;ide from any thing he had once re&s;olved on, grew quite incen&s;ed again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Colonel Conolly, too, had, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, grown very impatient at the delay of an union, on which his mind was &s;et as much as lord Arlington's, and often urged the latter to u&s;e authority with his &s;on, as entreaties were of no avail; till at la&s;t his ar|guments working on lord Arlington's own feelings, wrought him up to the very point which Theodore had long fore&s;een and dreaded. Accordingly, lord Arlington, one day, on his return from a morning's ride to Airville, called his &s;on into his &s;tudy, and with a har&s;hne&s;s of tone and manner, which he had never before u&s;ed towards him, &s;pake thus to him:</P>
<P>'Theodore, deare&s;t &s;on of my affection, for who&s;e &s;ake I have con&s;ented, for &s;o many years, to bani&s;h my&s;elf from a world, which had &s;o many charms for me; how is it, that I am to endure the mortification of &s;eeing you perfectly in&s;en&s;ible to all that I have done for you, while you make not the &s;malle&s;t return to me for &s;uch obligations? One only thing have I ever a&s;ked of you, in return for all I have done, all I have given up for your &s;ake, yet that you deny me, with an ob&s;tinacy that wounds me to the &s;oul. How is this, how can you be thus ungrateful?'</P>
<P>'Oh! &s;pare me, &s;pare me, my deare&s;t father, wound me not thus,' cried the agitated Theodore 'Heaven is my witne&s;s, with what reluctance I ap|pear thus ungrateful to you; but the &s;acrifice you de|mand&mdash;'</P>
<P>'The &s;acrifice!' exclaimed lord Arlington, with a countenance pale with anger. 'What is the &s;a|crifice I a&s;k you to make?&mdash;This mighty &s;acrifice is to marry an amiable and beautiful woman, whom thou&s;ands would rejoice to have in their power, with a fortune beyond what your mo&s;t &s;anguine expecta|tions could hope for, and thus to render happy the declining years of an affectionate parent, who has thought no &s;acrifice too great to make for you; to &s;ee
<PB N="22" REF="038283_0021_10118919C3BAF8A8">
your paternal inheritances freed from their pre&s;ent embarra&s;&s;ments, and in a &s;ituation to be tran&s;mitted, unincumbered, to the remote&s;t po&s;terity;&mdash;this, this is the mighty &s;acrifice I a&s;k.'</P>
<P>'Oh, 'tis too much, 'tis too much!' exclaimed Theodore, convul&s;ed with agitation: 'I wanted not this to rend my &s;oul in pieces; no, no, my father, it mu&s;t not, cannot be.'</P>
<P>'Grant me patience, heaven,' exclaimed the in|dignant lord Arlington, 'what in&s;ufferable ob&s;tinacy! but hear me, &s;ir, my pa&s;&s;ions once rou&s;ed, are not ea&s;y to be calmed; comply with my wi&s;hes, or I &s;wear&mdash;'</P>
<P>'Oh! hold, hold,' cried Theodore, 'hear me, deare&s;t father, hear me&mdash;'</P>
<P>'By heaven,' &s;aid lord Arlington, 'I will hear no more!&mdash;either con&s;ent before three days are ex|pired, to what I de&s;ire, or never come into my pre|&s;ence any more.'</P>
<P>So &s;aying, he bur&s;t ha&s;tily out of the room, and flew to colonel Conolly, to relate what had pa&s;&s;ed, leaving Theodore in a &s;ituation more ea&s;ily to be imagined than de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Colonel Conolly applauded the re&s;olution which lord Arlington had at la&s;t &s;hewn; and &s;aid, he did not doubt but it would have the de&s;ired effect. He added, that his fortune &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed of in any way that lord Arlington and his &s;on wi&s;hed; for he had no other object but to &s;ee his daughter the wife of mr. Percival.</P>
<P>The three days which lord Arlington had allowed to his &s;on for making his determination, pa&s;&s;ed over without his ever &s;eeing him, or even enquiring for him. Indeed, had be enquired for him, it would have been to no purpo&s;e, for Theodore had been ab|&s;ent from the ca&s;tle the whole time; nor did any one belonging to the hou&s;e know what was become of him. On the evening of the third day, however, he arrived at the ca&s;tle, ju&s;t in time to attend his fa|ther's
<PB N="23" REF="038283_0022_1013BFD62A6DF810">
&s;ummons, when he appeared before him, pale, dejected, tottering in his &s;teps, apparently plunged in the deepe&s;t affliction, and mo&s;t truly an object of compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Such a &s;pectacle in a moment di&s;armed lord Ar|lington's anger, and turned it immediately into re|mor&s;e, as he con&s;idered him&s;elf the author of his &s;on's mi&s;ery. He took him by the hand, led him to a &s;eat, and began to &s;ay the mo&s;t &s;oothing things to him. Theodore could not &s;peak for &s;ome minutes: but when the power of utterance returned, 'No more of this, I beg, my father,' he &s;aid, 'your kind|ne&s;s now wounds me as deeply as your anger did, when la&s;t we met&mdash;I am now wholly your's&mdash; do with me as you plea&s;e&mdash;make me&mdash;make me&mdash;the hu&s;band &mdash;of mi&s;s Co&mdash;nolly&mdash;I have no more&mdash;to &s;ay&mdash; again&s;t it.'</P>
<P>The&s;e words were uttered with &s;uch a faltering accent, that they were &s;carcely articulate; but lord Arlington under&s;tanding by them an a&s;&s;ent to his wi&s;hes, broke forth into warm expre&s;&s;ions of joy at that event, mingling them with the deepe&s;t concern for the &s;tate in which he &s;aw his &s;on.</P>
<P>'Pray, pray, &s;ay no more,' &s;aid Theodore, 'I have con&s;ented to this marriage. Talk not either of joy, &s;orrow, or gratitude. I mu&s;t have time to re|cover my&s;elf. I will propo&s;e it in form in a few days: but in the mean time let me be left to my&s;elf &mdash;I &s;hall &s;oon be calm &mdash;I &s;hall indeed&mdash;but rea&s;on will be&s;t gain &s;trength in privacy&mdash;excu&s;e me, my father&mdash;forgive me&mdash;I cannot &s;tay with you now.'</P>
<P>He ro&s;e up, and was going out of the room, but was hardly able to &s;upport him&s;elf. The a&s;toni&s;hed lord Arlington offered to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, with looks ex|pre&s;&s;ive of the deepe&s;t terror. He feared to lo&s;e &s;ight of his &s;on, in the &s;tate in which he &s;aw him, yet wi&s;hed not to di&s;tre&s;s him farther, by combating his wi&s;h to be alone. Theodore read in his father's eyes what was pa&s;&s;ing in his mind.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="038283_0023_1011891B505CFED0">'Do you then fear me, my father?' he &s;aid, 'but you need not&mdash;indeed you need not&mdash;I am agitated &mdash;I am not well&mdash;but my &s;en&s;es are perfect. I am not di&s;tracted&mdash;indeed I am not&mdash;let me go then. I will &s;ee you again to-morrow, if I can&mdash;but tru&s;t me to my&s;elf&mdash;you may &s;afely do it.'</P>
<P>'But let me then a&s;&s;i&s;t you, my Theodore, to get to your chamber. Support your&s;elf on my arm; you are weak; you mu&s;t be very ill.'</P>
<P>'No, not very ill&mdash;a night's re&s;t will do much for me&mdash;pray don't be alarmed&mdash;there is no cau&s;e for alarm.'</P>
<P>At the&s;e words he quitted the room, leaving lord Arlington to a train of very unplea&s;ant reflections. He plainly &s;aw that &s;omething &s;at very heavy on the mind of his &s;on, and thought that he had pu&s;hed the affair of the match too far. He even re&s;olved to offer to relea&s;e his &s;on from the con&s;ent he had given to it; and had almo&s;t determined to go immediately to colonel Conolly, to inform him of the &s;tate of affairs, and rather to hazard an ab&s;olute breach with him, than to permit the match to proceed any farther. But it grew late in the evening, and he determined to defer the matter till the next morning.</P>
<P>When the morning arrived&punc; however, his &s;on ap|peared &s;o much amended in the &s;tate both of his body and mind, that he thought matters were not quite &s;o bad as they had &s;eemed to be on the preceding night: and he determined to wait for a day or two, to &s;ee how he went on, and not to act with too great precipitation. In &s;hort, by the time that a few days had elap&s;ed, Theodore had acquired &s;uch an a&s;cen|dancy over him&s;elf, that he could conceal, from all but him&s;elf, the angui&s;h that inwardly preyed upon him.</P>
<P>Lord Arlington ob&s;erved the daily amendment in his appearance, with the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction; and &s;oon lo&s;t, with his alarms for his &s;on, the idea of putting off the match. In a &s;hort time, therefore,
<PB N="25" REF="038283_0024_1011891D48413C48">
pur&s;uant to the promi&s;e he had given his father, he made his offer in form to mi&s;s Conolly, which was accepted with tran&s;port by her, and her father; and when all things were duly prepared, Horatio Conolly became the wife of Theodore Percival.</P>

<P>COLONEL CONOLLY's joy at this event, was as unbounded as his per&s;everance in accompli&s;hing it had been; but he did not long &s;urvive it. About &s;ix weeks after the marriage took place, he was &s;uddenly taken off by an apoplectic fit, and put mr. Percival into complete po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his large fortune.

<P>About a year after their marriage, mrs. Percival pre&s;ented her hu&s;band with a &s;on, to the un&s;peakable
<PB N="26" REF="038283_0025_1011891F109CA3C8">
joy of his grandfather. Mr. Percival too, &s;eemed plea&s;ed with this addition to his family; but his joys were always clouded over by at lea&s;t an equal portion of chagrin; a chagrin too, which was increa&s;ed by the reflection that he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every thing, which, according to the opinion of the world, could conduce to the happine&s;s of man. But perhaps we can in no way paint to the reader &s;o forcibly the then &s;tate of his mind, as by pre&s;enting him with a letter, written by mr. Percival him&s;elf, at the time we are &s;peaking of.</P>
<P>A friend of his youth, with whom he had kept up a con&s;tant corre&s;pondence during his travels, had frequently written to him &s;ince his return to Ireland, and &s;ince his marriage, but had never received any an&s;wer from him, except to his congratulations on his nuptials. He again wrote to him on the birth of his &s;on, and with congratulations on that event, mingled reproaches for his &s;ilence, adding, that he &s;carcely knew whether he ought to write to him again. To this letter Theodore wrote the following an&s;wer: <LETTER>
<P>'I acknowledge, my dear friend, the ju&s;tice of your reproaches: I have been negligent of you: I am negligent of all the world, for there is &s;carcely a worldly object which can intere&s;t me.&mdash;Yes, my friend, that wife whom half the world envies me, who&s;e worth, accompli&s;hments, and ardent affection for me, I feel and admire&mdash;I am negligent even of her. I feel that I wrong her, and dete&s;t my&s;elf for it. But I have this to urge in my defence, that &s;he never was the object of my choice, and my indif|ference for her I cannot conquer; yet her whole &s;tudy is to plea&s;e and recommend her&s;elf to me. Oh! why did I ever con&s;ent to this ill-fated union? why did I not re&s;trict, that it was not my&s;elf alone that I was &s;acrificing to my father's wi&s;hes, but Ho|ratia too? I am convinced that I was wrong, and

and that I ought to have re&s;i&s;ted my father to the end. Horatia, though &s;he had given up her heart wholly to me, might, in time, have conquered her pa&s;&s;ion, and been happy; but with a hu&s;band who is indifferent to her, &s;he never can be &s;o I thought every thing would be &s;moothed to me, when I &s;aw my father happy&mdash;vain thought!&mdash;how often am I forced to break away from the joy that beams in his countenance, and &s;eems to reign in his &s;oul, to con|ceal the angui&s;h that preys on mine? In the deep re|ce&s;&s;es of the &s;urrounding rocks and woods, I lie down to give vent to my &s;orrows, that I may return to my family with a compo&s;ed countenance; but though, by the&s;e means, I deceive my father tolerably well, I cannot deceive my wife! &s;he feels, I know&mdash; I &s;ee that &s;he does that my attentions to her are forced, the effect of duty, not of affection. She &s;ees me ki&s;s my little &s;on, and pre&s;s him fondly to my bo&s;om, but &s;ees angui&s;h mingled with my fondne&s;s. Such is the &s;ituation of one who has now been, in the e&s;timation of the world, for above a year a happy hu&s;band.

<P>Hitherto, however, &s;elf reproaches were the only cen&s;ures mr. Percival had incurred; for the world &s;aw no rea&s;on to cen&s;ure him, &s;ince, to outward ap|pearance his conduct was exemplary. The time, however, was arrived, when a different &s;cene was to be laid open Mrs. Percival was recovered from her lying-in; and as no rea&s;on remained for the family living any longer in retirement, it was determined that they &s;hould pa&s;s the en&s;uing winter in London. Every thing was accordingly prepared for their de|parture, and the day fixed for them to &s;et off for Dublin, from which place they were to embark for England. On the evening before that day, lord Ar|lington, his &s;on, and daughter, were looking over &s;ome
<PB N="28" REF="038283_0027_10118924544F2478">
papers together, in order to the &s;ettling of &s;ome fa|mily concerns, before they left the place, when a let|ter was brought to Theodore, which having read, he changed colour, &s;eemed violently agitated, and with|out &s;aying a word, went ha&s;tily out of the room.</P>
<P>Lord Arlington and mrs. Percival both ob&s;erved his agitation, but for &s;ome time took no notice of it; but an hour having elap&s;ed, without Theodore's re|turning, lord Arlington began to expre&s;s anxiety about him; for, &s;aid he to his daughter, 'you mu&s;t have ob&s;erved how much he &s;eemed agitated when he read that letter.'</P>
<P>'I did indeed,' an&s;wered mrs. Percival, 'but hardly dared to ob&s;erve it&mdash;I have &s;een &s;uch emotions &s;o frequently, that I dare not ob&s;erve upon them.'</P>
<P>'Ha? it is even &s;o then?' &s;aid lord Arlington, 'you think my &s;on unhappy.'</P>
<P>'Alas! it is mo&s;t certain,' &s;he replied: 'he en|deavours to conceal it; but it will &s;ometimes break out. Suppo&s;e we enquire if he is &s;till at home.'</P>
<P>'No,' &s;aid lord Arlington, 'I will go my&s;elf and &s;eek for him.'</P>
<P>Lord Arlington went out of the room&mdash;he &s;earched all over the hou&s;e, but could not find his &s;on. He then enquired of his &s;ervants, if they knew any thing of him; they could only an&s;wer, that he left the hou&s;e on receiving the letter, and had not returned &s;ince; but they could not tell which way he went. They were then que&s;tioned, who brought the letter? To which they an&s;wered, that it was brought by a woman, with her face muffled up in a large cap and bonnet, who &s;eemed unwilling to be &s;een; &s;he only gave in the letter, de&s;ired it might be carried to mr. Percival, and then walked away as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Here was ground for alarming &s;u&s;picions; yet lord Arlington re&s;olved not to proceed too ha&s;tily. Two hours more pa&s;&s;ed, and no Theodore appeared. Lord Arlington then &s;ent round the grounds, particularly to a wood, which he knew his &s;on u&s;ed to frequent
<PB N="29" REF="038283_0028_101189264A158B00">
very much; but no &s;on was to be found. He &s;ent about the pari&s;h, but could learn nothing of him; he had not been &s;een by any body: night came on, but they could not go to bed, and re&s;olved to renew the &s;earch as &s;oon as day-light appeared&mdash;they did &s;o, but with no better &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, as lord Arlington and mrs. Percival were &s;itting down to breakfa&s;t, the former was called out of the room to a woman, who de&s;ired to &s;peak with him alone, and whom he, therefore, ordered to be &s;hewn into his &s;tudy: &s;he appeared carrying in her arms a beautiful female child, very neatly dre&s;&s;ed, and who &s;eemed to be about a year and a half old. She drew a letter from her pocket, and gave it to him, &s;aying, 'that &s;he was ordered to deliver it into no hands but his own, and to wait while he read it.' Lord Ar|lington &s;aw it was his &s;on's writing&mdash;he eagerly opened it, and read as follows: <LETTER>
<P>'Can you, oh! my father, pardon the pre&s;ump|tion of a &s;on, who is driven almo&s;t to di&s;traction, and whom, perhaps, you may never &s;ee more?

</LETTER></P>
<P>Whether a&s;toni&s;hment, horror, or tenderne&s;s, pre|vailed mo&s;t in the brea&s;t of lord Arlington, on read|ing this letter, it is difficult to determine; they all contended for empire. He looked fir&s;t at the letter, then at the child, which the nur&s;e had &s;et down, and which in&s;tantly ran up to him, and was looking in his face with all the eloquence of &s;peechle&s;s innocence. He could not re&s;i&s;t it&mdash;he caught her in his arms&mdash; ki&s;&s;ed her ardently&mdash;'yes, lovely Antoinette,' &s;aid he, 'he mu&s;t be more than a mon&s;ter, who could with&s;tand &s;uch &s;weetne&s;s, &s;uch innocence! you &s;hall be my child &mdash; my &s;on is intere&s;ted in your fate&mdash;you are unprotected&mdash;what motives can plead &s;tronger?' He ki&s;&s;ed her again &mdash;&s;he &s;miled&mdash;a tear &s;tole down his cheek&mdash;he remained for &s;ome minutes quite ab|&s;orbed in contemplating her&mdash;he read the letter again &mdash;he was more and more bewildered&mdash;&s;he was born of illu&s;trious parents, and in lawful wedlock, yet thrown on his compa&s;&s;ion&mdash;it was affecting to think of. He inquired of the nur&s;e, if &s;he knew any thing of the child's hi&s;tory; all &s;he could tell him, was that about fifteen months before, mr. Percival came one day to her hou&s;e at Killarney, with this child in his arms, and followed by a woman, who appeared to be not more than twenty years of age. He a&s;ked, if &s;he would be willing to take in the woman and child as lodgers, and &s;aid that he would pay her whatever &s;he required for it; that it was of importance to him, his
<PB N="32" REF="038283_0031_1011892C935DCF38">
placing them there &s;hould be kept a &s;ecret; and that &s;he &s;hould be well rewarded for not betraying him. The woman &s;aid, &s;he at fir&s;t he&s;itated, whether <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hould undertake this charge; but as he was urge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> with her to con&s;ent to it, &s;he at la&s;t did yield to him; and that they had continued at her hou&s;e ever &s;ince. She &s;aid, that mr. Percival often came to &s;ee the child, but that it was generally, either late in the evening, or early in the morning; and that he &s;eemed exce&s;&s;ively fond of it. That the evening before, he came to her hou&s;e in a violent agitation, and took the child's nur&s;e into another room, where they &s;at for &s;ome time, in earne&s;t conver&s;ation; and then de&s;iring a pen and ink, he wrote the letter which &s;he had brought, and giving it into her hands, he de&s;ired her to carry that, with the child, by breakfa&s;t time the next morning&punc; to Arlington ca&s;tle; to give the letter into no hands but lord Arlington's, and to wait with him while he read it. Then he and the young wo|man, after both of them had affectionately ki&s;&s;ed the child, went out of the hou&s;e; but &s;he did not know what became of them.</P>
<P>This relation was no le&s;s a&s;toni&s;hing to lord Ar|lington, than all that had before pa&s;&s;ed. He then enquired by what names the child and its nur&s;e had been called? And was an&s;wered, that the former was called Antoinette, the latter Joanna; but no &s;urnames had ever apppeared for either. His next enquiry was, what &s;ort of a woman Joanna appeared to be? To which mrs. Roberts (for that was the name of the woman) replied, that &s;he was a genteel appearing woman &s;he &s;hould gue&s;s her to be rather of the mid|dling rank of life, but &s;he could not tell exactly; that &s;he was a French woman, and under&s;tood very little Engli&s;h when fir&s;t &s;he came over, but could now &s;peak it very well, &s;o as to be perfectly under&s;tood. She &s;aid, that often, while &s;he was ki&s;&s;ing and care&s;&s;|ing the child, &s;he would &s;hed tears, and lament that it was to live in &s;uch ob&s;curity; but, that &s;he had
<PB N="33" REF="038283_0032_1011892FDAE6DF10">
never &s;uffered a word to e&s;cape her lips, relative to the parents of the child; but (mrs. Roberts &s;aid) her own idea was, that Antoinette was the child of Joanna, by mr. Percival; and that mr. Percival would have married her, only that he found his father was de&s;irous of his marrying mi&s;s Conolly. All this &s;he &s;aid, with an apology to lord Arlington; but as he &s;eemed to wi&s;h to hear all &s;he could tell him, &s;he ven|tured to mention her conjectures.</P>
<P>The&s;e conjectures were ingenious on the part of mrs. Roberts, but did not at all &s;atisfy lord Arlington. His &s;on declared the child to be born in lawful wed|lock; and &s;he could not, therefore, be his child by Joanna, unle&s;s he was married to her; and, &s;urely, he could not have been &s;o ba&s;e as to marry mi&s;s Co|nolly, while he had another wife living&mdash;it was all my&s;tery. He a&s;ked mrs. Roberts if &s;he had been paid up to the pre&s;ent time? To which &s;he replied, &s;he had been always regularly, and liberally, paid; and that mr. Percival had &s;ettled every thing of that kind the evening before. Lord Arlington then gave her a guinea, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed her.</P>
<P>What now was to be done with regard to mrs. Percival? This que&s;tion agitated lord Arlington very much: he had left her in &s;uch a &s;tate of &s;u&s;|pen&s;e, that &s;he mu&s;t be anxious to &s;ee him again. He was re&s;olved, him&s;elf, to take the child into his pro|tection: but, what would mrs. Percival &s;ay to her hu&s;band's reque&s;t? He determined, at la&s;t, that it was better to break the ice at once; he, therefore, with the child in his arms, returned to the breakfa&s;t room, where mrs. Percival had &s;pent many an anxi|ous moment, in expectation of him. Judge of her &s;urpri&s;e, at &s;eeing him enter; not alone, as &s;he ex|pected, but bringing an infant with him. He went to his &s;eat&mdash;he &s;at down&mdash;he looked earne&s;tly at mrs. Percival, who&s;e eyes &s;poke the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>'Look on this child, my love; is it not a little angel?'</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="038283_0033_101189322C921478">'Heavens! What do you mean my lord?'</P>
<P>'Can you be a mother to this child?'</P>
<P>'Oh God! oh God! Is it then &s;o?&mdash;&s;ome other woman.'&mdash;She could &s;ay no more&mdash;&s;he fell back in her chair.</P>
<P>'Be calm, my deare&s;t daughter,' &s;aid lord Arling|ton. 'I know not who&s;e child this is&mdash;I do not know that &s;he is my &s;on's&mdash;compo&s;e your&s;elf&mdash;call up all your re&s;olution to your aid, and read this letter.'</P>
<P>Mrs. Percival rou&s;ed her&s;elf; 'Oh! if I am thus in&s;ulted,' &s;he exclaimed;&mdash;'but let me be calm!' She then took the letter, and read it. Love, horror, re&s;entment, and mortification, alternately &s;eized her brea&s;t, and &s;parkled in her eye: but they pa&s;&s;ed off in rapid &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. She looked at the child&mdash;&s;he had only one &s;en&s;ation left, which was, &s;elf-condemnation at the manner in which &s;he had de&s;cended from the true dignity of her &s;ex, in giving her hand to a man, to whom &s;he well knew at the time, &s;he was an object of indifference, if not al&s;o of aver&s;ion. 'Yes!' &s;he exclaimed, 'I am rightly &s;erved; but I will make all the atonement in my power&mdash;&s;he &s;hall be my child&mdash; 'tis enough that my Theodore de&s;ires it&mdash;come, then, poor orphan, come to my arms.' So &s;aying, &s;he took the child from lord Arlington, ki&s;&s;ed it, and bur&s;t into an agony of tears. The&s;e, at length, &s;omewhat &s;ub&s;iding, &s;he again ki&s;&s;ed the child&mdash;'haple&s;s An|toinette,' &s;aid &s;he, 'you &s;hall indeed be my child; I will endeavour, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by my father, to form your infant mind to virtue, that, if ever that unhappy wan|derer, who is &s;o anxious for thy welfare, &s;hall hereafter &s;ee thee, he may know that he has not erred, in &s;up|po&s;ing me capable of exerting my benevolence to|wards unprotected innocence.'</P>
<P>Lord Arlington warmly applauded her &s;entiments and from that hour the friendle&s;s Antoinette was con&s;idered as the child of adoption by them both, and provided for accordingly.</P>
<P>But not to the child alone was their anxiety con|fined.
<PB N="35" REF="038283_0034_10118933C04D7BF0">
No pains nor expen&s;e was &s;pared to find out, if po&s;&s;ible, what was become of the di&s;tracted Theo|dore. But all was of no avail: no traces of the cour&s;e he had taken, could be di&s;covered: and after many weeks of fruitle&s;s enquiry after him, the pur&s;uit was given up; and they re&s;ted in the hope, that time might throw more light on this my&s;terious affair, and di&s;cover what diligence had &s;ought for in vain.</P>
<P>They then applied them&s;elves to arranging, and putting in order his apartment, which was left in the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion; determining carefully to lock up every thing which he had left, con&s;idering his papers, and all things belonging to him, as a mo&s;t &s;acred depo&s;it.</P>

<P>THIS unhappy affair had put a total &s;top to their intended journey to Great Britain. After &s;ome time, lord Arlington mentioned it again to his daughter-in-law, and propo&s;ed to travel about &s;ome parts of the country during the &s;ummer, and go to London in the winter. Mrs. Percival replied to this propo&s;al, that
<PB N="36" REF="038283_0035_101189358BE43468">
&s;he by no means wi&s;hed him, at pre&s;ent, to think of leaving Ireland, alleging, with good rea&s;on, that if any hopes could be entertained, of hearing again of their lo&s;t friend, it mu&s;t be by remaining on the &s;pot. 'And what plea&s;ure, my lord,' added &s;he, 'can I hope to find from the gaieties of London, in the un|happy &s;ituation in which I am now placed?&mdash;no, my lord, the time was, when indeed I &s;hould have &s;ought, in di&s;&s;ipation, to cha&s;e away &s;orrow; but after living more than a year with my Theodore, I have learnt, that reading and reflection are the mo&s;t powerful cordials to heal a wounded mind. And though, alas! they could not work a complete cure in his, yet I am well convinced, that it was from tho&s;e &s;ources he derived all the little intervals of tranquility that he ever did attain; and we know not to what a depth his &s;oul was wounded; perhaps, even beyond the power of the &s;tronge&s;t medicines to heal.</P>
<P>'In a word, my lord, &s;ince my connexion with that beloved Theodore, I have found that my father (who I am well a&s;&s;ured meant to do every thing that was kind to me) mi&s;took the path of prudence in my education, and in giving me every &s;hewy accom|pli&s;hment, which it was po&s;&s;ible to acquire, neglected to give me one, which, though of a le&s;s &s;plendid na|ture, is worth all others put together&mdash;a ta&s;te for reading and intellectual improvement. How often have I felt&mdash;with the deepe&s;t mortification felt&mdash;my total in&s;ufficiency to be the companion of a mind &s;o highly cultivated, as that of my Theodore; and &s;ighed in &s;ecret, to render my&s;elf more worthy of him!</P>
<P>'Let me then, my lord, live &s;till in retirement, and &s;o enrich my mind with knowledge, that &s;hould heaven ever give back to my arms a hu&s;band, whom I almo&s;t adore, I may &s;hew him, that I have a &s;oul ca|pable of emulating even the perfections of his.'</P>
<P>Lord Arlington heard her with equal a&s;toni&s;hment and delight. He very much feared him&s;elf, that her deficiency as a dome&s;tic companion, had been one

The truth of this po&s;ition mrs. Percival &s;trongly exem|plified. She made a rapid progre&s;s in her pur&s;uits, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of lord Arlington, and another gentleman, a friend of the family: this was a doctor Schomberg, a clergyman, who was a widower, with one &s;on and one daughter, both married and &s;ettled; and who, being an excellent &s;cholar, and a perfect gentleman, and having a great deal of lei&s;ure time, was &s;olicited to undertake the office of mrs. Percival's in&s;tructor.</P>
<P>With &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and her own indefatigable indu&s;try, mrs. Percival made a very rapid progre&s;s in various branches of knowledge, &s;o that by the time the children were of an age to want her in&s;truction, no one was more capable of in&s;tructing them; nor did &s;he ever depute that ta&s;k to another, giving an excellent example to the daughters of affluence, who are too apt to imagine, that wealth excu&s;es them from maternal duties <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd who think they have done &s;uffi|cient for their children, by placing them at a boarding &s;chool, or putting a tyrannical governe&s;s over their heads, who teaches them nothing effectually but to be conceited and to make court&s;ies.</P>
<P>Four years had now elap&s;ed, &s;ince the &s;udden de|parture of Theodore; in all which time, notwith|&s;tanding the utmo&s;t diligence had been employed, not a trace of him could be di&s;covered; he had never written to his family, and the whole bu&s;ine&s;s remained as my&s;terious as ever. Mrs. Percival was &s;ettled into a calm re&s;ignation; her whole thoughts were occu|pied in improving her&s;elf and her children, and in attending to &s;uch amu&s;ements as a retired country life affords, and &s;he felt no wi&s;h for other amu&s;e|ments. Hope was not totally bani&s;hed from her brea&s;t, though its rays glimmered there but faintly; and lord Arlington's affectionate kindne&s;s to her lightened all her cares. But that &s;ource of con&s;o|lation &s;he was now to lo&s;e; his health had been ra|ther declining for &s;ome time: the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of
<PB N="39" REF="038283_0038_1011893CB210B238">
which made him more anxious than ever to hear of his &s;on; and that anxiety again preying on a debili|tated con&s;titution brought on his di&s;&s;olution, though at no very advanced age.</P>
<P>This &s;troke called forth all mrs. Percival's philo|&s;ophy to &s;upport with fortitude. Though almo&s;t adoring her hu&s;band, and half di&s;tracted at his de|&s;ertion of her, yet while &s;he &s;till had lord Arlington to look up to as a friend, coun&s;ellor, and a&s;&s;i&s;tant in the education of her children, &s;he felt not quite &s;o de&s;olate, as her &s;ituation now appeared to be. She had, however, one friend yet left, doctor Schom|berg, who had for more than two years been a con|&s;tant inmate in the hou&s;e, and whom &s;he de&s;ired to continue as &s;uch; wi&s;ely &s;etting at defiance any cen|&s;ures, which a babbling, ill-natured world might pa&s;s on her, for acting thus contrary to its arbitrary laws, which &s;he con&s;idered as trifles, when put in compa|ri&s;on with the &s;olid advantages, which &s;he hoped would re&s;ult to her&s;elf and the children, from having &s;uch a man con&s;tantly with them.</P>
<P>Lord Arlington left his whole fortune in mrs. Per|cival's power, while his &s;on continued to ab&s;ent him|&s;elf from his family, but made many provi&s;ions in ca&s;e of his return; none of which, however, are ma|terial for the reader to be made acquainted with.</P>
<P>Thus was mrs. Percival left for the pre&s;ent, &s;ole arbitre&s;s of a large fortune, with the charge of educat|ing two children, and providing by her example, and in&s;truction, for their future re&s;pectable appearance in life. There &s;carcely could, perhaps, be a more ar|duous &s;ituation for a woman to fill with propriety. Young and hand&s;ome, an object of admiration, round whom, had &s;he cho&s;en to &s;hew her&s;elf in public, thou|&s;ands of flatterers would have flocked; yet de&s;erted by her hu&s;band, whom &s;till &s;he could not cea&s;e mo&s;t ardently to love&mdash;even uncertain, whether that hu&s;|band were yet alive&mdash;with two children to educate, one of whom was not her own, and to whom, from
<PB N="40" REF="038283_0039_1011893EB4045C48">
the circum&s;tances in which &s;he was thrown into her care, many women would have conceived an uncon|querable di&s;like&mdash;with a large fortune &s;olely under her management&mdash;&s;he was in a &s;ituation truly per|plexing. Yet all the&s;e concurrent &s;ources of embar|ra&s;&s;ment, which would have weighed down &s;ome minds, and rendered them almo&s;t incapable of action at all, only &s;erved to tender her's more vigorous, and to make her double her exertions to go through her ta&s;k with prudence and propriety.</P>
<P>She determined to inform her children preci&s;ely of the true &s;ituation of the family, when &s;he thought them of an age to be capable of receiving the &s;tory as &s;he wi&s;hed, and rea&s;oning properly upon it: but 'till then &s;he thought it better to conceal from them how they were circum&s;tanced, nor to let them have any other idea than that they were really brother and &s;i&s;ter. And &s;he tru&s;ted that when they had been educated in &s;uch habits of friend&s;hip, as &s;hould &s;ub&s;i&s;t between brother and &s;i&s;ter, that tho&s;e habits would continue, even when their true &s;ituations were known to them; for &s;he equally dreaded that a change of the ideas they had been accu&s;tomed to entertain of each other, &s;hould operate either to an alienation of their mutual regard, or to carrying that regard beyond the limits of fraternal affection, again&s;t which Theodore had, in his letter, given the &s;tricte&s;t caution.</P>
<P>When, &s;ometimes, in the innocence and &s;implicity of childhood, they would enquire whether they had no papa, &s;he always told them that their papa was gone abroad into foreign countries; and &s;he was afraid that he was dead, as &s;he had not heard of him for a long time. Nor was &s;he at all apprehen&s;ive, that Antoinette might learn by accident, any hints of her own &s;tory; for before &s;he was of an age to have attended to them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat &s;tory was almo&s;t forgotten in the neighbourhood. She was called mi&s;s Percival, as Theodore had reque&s;ted; and, as &s;he was gene|rally believed to be a natural child of his, and it was
<PB N="41" REF="038283_0040_10118942EEF10F30">
&s;uppo&s;ed that he was gone off with her mother, after the neighbourhood had amu&s;ed them&s;elves with the affair, as long as they found amu&s;ement in it, which was no longer than 'till a more novel circum&s;tance &s;uperceded it, it was thought of no more.</P>
<P>They continued at the ca&s;tle, 'till Henry had com|pleted his &s;eventh year; when Antoinette was &s;up|po&s;ed to be approaching to the end of her ninth. Mrs. Percival now began to think that it was time for them in &s;ome &s;ort to emerge from the clo&s;e re|tirement in which they lived; and &s;he determined, therefore, to go over to England, for the purpo&s;e of completing their education, and introducing them to more knowledge of the world, a knowledge which &s;he con&s;idered as an e&s;&s;ential part of their education.</P>
<P>Her great difficulty was in what way be&s;t to di&s;po&s;e of Henry, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">till &s;he thought him old enough to travel with advantage and improvement, which could not be 'till he was &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen years of age. As to Antoinette, &s;he had not a doubt, that it was be&s;t to keep her entirely under her own care, procuring only proper ma&s;ters to in&s;truct her in &s;uch things, as none but profe&s;&s;ed ma&s;ters could properly in&s;truct her in; &s;uch as mu&s;ic, drawing, and all that are generally de|nominated genteel accompli&s;hments; and as the&s;e were to be be&s;t procured in London, &s;he determined to re&s;ide there during the winter, and &s;eek out &s;ome plea&s;ant retreat in the country for the &s;ummer.</P>
<P>After much con&s;ultation with doctor Schomberg, it was determined to find out, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;ome eligible &s;ituation for Henry, among that de&s;cription of gen|tlemen, who undertake the education of &s;uch a num|ber of boys only, as they can educate them&s;elves; which is, perhaps, the be&s;t &s;ituation a boy can be placed in, to obviate the objections which he again&s;t an entirely private education, and the &s;till &s;tronger objections which &s;ub&s;i&s;t again&s;t a public &s;chool. When this was determined on, doctor Schomberg wrote to a friend in England, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o make enquiries after
<PB N="42" REF="038283_0041_101189447B3E61C0">
&s;uch a &s;ituation; and was by him recommended to a gentleman in Hamp&s;hire, who took only eight boys at a time, and who had ju&s;t then a vacancy. The account given of this gentleman's character, learning, plan of education, and general manners, being &s;uch as exactly corre&s;ponded with the ideas of mrs. Per|cival, &s;he immediately agreed on terms with him, and determined to carry her &s;on thither the en&s;uing &s;pring.</P>
<P>She, accordingly, arranged all her affairs in Ireland, and having con&s;igned the management of them en|tirely to the &s;teward, mr. Mac-Allen, who&s;e fidelity had been long tried and approved in the family, &s;he left Arlington ca&s;tle about the end of the month of April, attended by doctor Schomberg, Henry, and Antoinette, and arrived at the hou&s;e of her &s;on's fu|ture tutor, mr. Sidney, in about three weeks after, &s;he having made many little &s;tops by the way, to &s;hew her children &s;uch things as &s;he thought worthy of their ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Having mentioned to mr. Sidney her intention of &s;eeking out &s;ome country re&s;idence for the &s;ummer months during the time that &s;he &s;hould think it pro|per to continue in England, he told her of a pretty retired place about ten miles from his hou&s;e, which was then to be let, and which he thought would &s;uit her exactly. She, accordingly, went to &s;ee it, and finding it quite the kind of place &s;he wi&s;hed to have, &s;he hired it, and immediately &s;ettled her&s;elf in it, with her good friend doctor Schomberg, and the amiable little Antoinette, leaving Henry under the care of mr. Sidney, with who&s;e appearance &s;he had been ex|tremely plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>After &s;pending a very plea&s;ant &s;ummer in Hamp|&s;hire, mrs. Percival went to London for the winter, where Antoinette was put under the tuition of pro|per ma&s;ters, and made a rapid progre&s;s in her various attainments. Mrs. Percival entered, in a very &s;mall degree, into what are called the gaieties of London;
<PB N="43" REF="038283_0042_1011894658733378">
but her hou&s;e &s;oon became the great re&s;ort of men of genius and talents, who&s;e &s;ociety &s;he was eager to cultivate, and who always met with a welcome re|ception from her.</P>
<P>After a winter &s;pent thus plea&s;antly and ration|ally, in the very &s;pot where the generality of women wa&s;te all their time in folly and di&s;&s;ipation, &s;he, re|turned in the &s;ummer again to her cottage in Hamp|&s;hire, accompanied only by Antoinette, doctor Schom|berg being gone to Ireland, on private bu&s;ine&s;s of his own.</P>

<P>IN a few days after mrs. Percival's return, her &s;on came over to &s;pend the day with her.

<P>Mrs. Percival, at &s;ight of the watch, turned as pale as death; her hand trembled; and &s;he could &s;carcely hold it, for &s;he immediately knew it to be her hu&s;|band's, and that he had taken it away with him; but
<PB N="44" REF="038283_0043_10118947ED5A4E48">
unwilling that the children &s;hould perceive her emo|tion, &s;he immediately recovered her&s;elf, and &s;aid, 'I am &s;orry, my love, that you have accepted &s;uch a pre|&s;ent. Who was it gave it to you?'</P>
<P>'It was the &s;trange man, mamma.'</P>
<P>'The &s;trange man, my love!' &s;aid mrs. Percival,</P>
<P>'What do you mean?'</P>
<P>'Why, mamma, he was a man, that came twice into our field, while we were all at play; and he looked for all the world like a beggar: but, however, he never begged, and he would make me take this watch.'</P>
<P>'I am &s;orry you did take it, my dear; you know I ordered you never to accept pre&s;ents, without mr. Sidney's leave; and I dare &s;ay, he did not give you leave to accept this?'</P>
<P>'No, mamma; for I had not an opportunity of a&s;king his leave; but he knows I have it; and he bid me &s;hew it to you. I'll tell you all about it. The fir&s;t time he came, we were all at play at cricket; and he came up and &s;aid, &s;o, my lads, you &s;eem all very merry; but you have gotten a very bad ball; I have a much better here in my pocket; try it; and then he pulled out a ball, and gave it to one of the boys; and then he began a&s;king all our names; and when I told him my name was Henry Percival, he a&s;ked me, whe|ther I had a papa and mamma alive; and whether I had any brothers and &s;i&s;ters? And I told him that I did not know, whether I had a papa or not, but that I had a mamma and a &s;i&s;ter: and then he a&s;ked me, how it came about, that I did not know whether I had a papa? and I told him, that he had been gone away a long time, and my mamma was afraid that he was dead, becau&s;e &s;he did not hear from him. Then he a&s;ked me, my &s;i&s;ter's name; and I told him it was Antoinette&mdash;and a great many more que&s;tions he a&s;ked me; and he de&s;ired I would read to him, if I had a book in my pocket; and &s;o I took out Gay's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ables, and read him one or two; and then he a&s;ked
<PB N="45" REF="038283_0044_10118250B1833778">
if I could read Latin; and &s;o I read him &s;ome of Ovid; and then he patted me on the head, and &s;aid I was a good boy, and bid me behave well to my mamma and &s;i&s;ter: and he enquired where you lived: and I told him at London in the winter, but you would come down again into Hamp&s;hire in the &s;ummer, to a place about ten miles off. And he a&s;ked, if you had al|ways lived in London; I told him no; we lived at Arlington ca&s;tle in Ireland 'till la&s;t year, and then I came to mr. Sidney's, and you did not mean to go back to Ireland, 'till I was to leave mr. Sidney again.'</P>
<P>'And what &s;ort of a looking man was he?' &s;aid mrs. Percival.</P>
<P>'Why, he was but a queer looking man, he had &s;uch a great beard, mamma, as long as I&s;aac the Jew's, at Killarney. Oh, and I forgot to tell you, mamma, that he a&s;ked me to let him cut off a lock of my hair, which I did, and he put it up in his pocket-book.'</P>
<P>'Well, my love,&mdash;but the watch?'</P>
<P>'Oh, mamma, I &s;hall come to that pre&s;ently; that was not 'till the &s;econd time that he came. I don't remember any thing more to tell you about the fir&s;t time he came. But we were talking about him at dinner; and mr. Sidney &s;aid it was very odd, and he told us if ever the man came again, to let him know, and he would come and &s;peak to him. Well, the next morning, he came, and he pulled out this watch; and a&s;ked me, if I liked it. And I &s;aid, yes; I thought it a very nice one; and then he &s;aid, he would give it to me; but I told him, that I was &s;ure my mamma would not like I &s;hould take it, then he &s;aid, he was &s;ure my mamma could not be angry with me for &s;uch a thing as that; and then I &s;aid, that &s;he ordered me never to take any pre&s;ent without mr. Sid|ney's leave; but that I would go and a&s;k him what I &s;hould do, for he &s;eemed &s;o earne&s;t that I &s;hould take it, mamma, that I did not know how to refu&s;e; and, ju&s;t as I was going to &s;ee for mr. Sidney, I &s;aw him come to the gate of the field, and then the man laid
<PB N="46" REF="038283_0045_1011894BDA7FB4E8">
the watch down on the ground, and ran away into the wood, and we &s;oon lo&s;t &s;ight of him, and he never came any more.'</P>
<P>'And how long ago was this, my love?'</P>
<P>'Why, mamma, it was only la&s;t week; I was go|ing to write to you, and tell you all about it; but mr. Sidney &s;aid, that I had better wait, and tell you all about it when I &s;aw you, as you was coming down &s;o &s;oon.'</P>
<P>What a field of &s;peculation was here opened to mrs. Percival: that this man was her hu&s;band, &s;he could not doubt for a moment; but how &s;trange was his behaviour, and how re&s;olute he &s;till &s;eemed to keep him&s;elf concealed from her! Alas! that woman that went off with him!&mdash;&s;he knew not what to think&mdash;but mr. Sidney was to come over in the af|ternoon to fetch Henry back, and then &s;he might, perhaps, hear more. When he arrived &s;he took him a&s;ide, and mentioned what her &s;on had told her, en|quiring at the &s;ame time if he knew any thing farther about this extraordinary man.</P>
<P>'He is an extraordinary man indeed, madam!' &s;aid mr. Sidney: 'Yes, madam, I can give you &s;ome farther particulars of him. When fir&s;t I heard the young gentlemen's account of him, the &s;ame idea &s;truck me, which, pardon me, madam, you no doubt entertain, that this was indeed mr. Percival (for mr. Sidney knew his &s;tory) and for that rea&s;on I de&s;ired to be immediately &s;ummoned, if he &s;hould appear again. I was &s;ummoned accordingly; but as you already know, madam, he ran away on &s;eeing me approach; I followed him into the wood, but could not &s;ee any thing of him. I immediately made en|quiries about the village, if &s;uch a man had been &s;een; and found that he had been about for two days: but no one &s;eemed to have concerned them&s;elves about him. He never &s;poke to any one, except at the public hou&s;e, when he a&s;ked for what he wanted, and they could not tell where he lodged. I, with &s;ome diffi|culty,
<PB N="47" REF="038283_0046_1011894E342FDD00">
madam, traced him to your pari&s;h, and from thence to Southampton, but there I quite lo&s;t him. I have however deputed a man whom I can tru&s;t, to make farther enquiries there; and pray heaven they may prove &s;ucce&s;sful!'</P>
<P>'But, you did not &s;ee him, &s;ir, when he was in your fields?'</P>
<P>'My view of him was indeed very imperfect, madam. I could &s;ee that he was tall, and that his clothes were very much tattered: but I enquired of one of the boys, a youth of &s;ixteen, what kind of a man he was; and he told me that he had a very dark &s;warthy complexion, remarkably fine eyes, a large black beard, and a great deal of long black hair, which hung very much about his face and &s;houlders, as if &s;tudiou&s;ly to a&s;&s;i&s;t in di&s;gui&s;ing him.'</P>
<P>'Ah! too &s;urely it was my hu&s;band!' &s;aid mrs. Percival, 'but&mdash;&s;till cruel, &s;till dark and my&s;terious in his conduct. Oh! &s;ir, you have been kind and friendly indeed, in the &s;earch you have made for him. What more can be done to di&s;cover him?'</P>
<P>'I know not of any thing farther to do,' returned mr. Sidney. 'You may depend on me, madam, that every exertion po&s;&s;ible &s;hall be made to gain you far|ther information; but allow me, madam, to &s;ugge&s;t, whether it will not be better, that you &s;hould remain quiet in this affair, and leave all enquiries to me; you may depend on my activity in your &s;ervice; and my exertions will not occa&s;ion the &s;peculations, that any made on your part might do.'</P>
<P>'Oh! how ju&s;t is your rea&s;oning, and how more than commonly friendly is your conduct!' &s;aid mrs. Percival. 'Yes! dear &s;ir, I agree with your opinion, and will my&s;elf make no &s;tir about the matter: but oh! my hu&s;band, how unkind is your conduct!&mdash;How have I de&s;erved!&mdash;But no&mdash;I have de&s;erved it all!&mdash; I will not dare to murmur.' She could not refrain from bur&s;ting into tears; but her fortitude &s;oon ro&s;e &s;uperior to all weakne&s;s, and re&s;training her emotions,
<PB N="48" REF="038283_0047_1011894FC9360840">
'No,' &s;he &s;aid, 'this weakne&s;s mu&s;t not be allowed!' and after a few minutes, &s;he returned with mr. Sidney to the children.</P>
<P>Day after day, however, pa&s;&s;ed over, nor was mr. Sidney able to give mrs. Percival any &s;atisfaction on the object of her pre&s;ent anxiety. He could learn no tidings of him, and, at la&s;t &s;he &s;unk again into a de&s;|pair of his ever returning to her. She had ju&s;t abandoned hope, when doctor Schomberg returned from his journey to Ireland; and &s;he imparted to him what had pa&s;&s;ed during his ab&s;ence. As &s;he fi|ni&s;hed her relation, he exclaimed, 'Poor unhappy man, and &s;o he has been in England al&s;o!'</P>
<P>'How!' &s;aid mrs. Percival, 'Do you then know any thing of him?'</P>
<P>'Indeed, I have now no doubt, that I do,' returned doctor Schomberg. I had, before I heard your re|lation, the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that he had vi|&s;ited Arlington ca&s;tle, ju&s;t before I went there, and you, madam, have confirmed me in the truth of my conjectures.'</P>
<P>'Oh! quickly tell me all you know,' &s;aid mrs. Percival, eagerly.</P>
<P>'I will, madam,' replied the doctor; 'I had, in|deed, he&s;itated within my&s;elf, whether I &s;hould im|part the &s;tory to you or not, le&s;t it might only be a renewal of your troubles, but as you know &s;o much already, I will conceal nothing from you.</P>
<P>'When I arrived at Arlington ca&s;tle,' he conti|nued, 'I found mr. Mac-Allen bu&s;ied in making en|quiries after a per&s;on, who had been there the week before, of whom he gave me the following account:'</P>
<P>'I &s;pent la&s;t week, &s;ir,' &s;aid he, 'at Limerick upon &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s of my own; and at my return, mrs.

the day you went away, he &s;poke very civilly, and de&s;ired to be permitted to look over the hou&s;e, which, as he looked like a gentleman, I immediately com|plied with. He was very quiet, till he got into the library, when all on a &s;udden he took a knife out of his pocket, and run it through mr. Percival's picture, &s;aying, that he looked &s;o di&s;agreeable, he could not bear to &s;ee him. I did not know what to do for my part,' &s;aid the hou&s;e-keeper; 'for he began to look &s;o wild, that I thought, to be &s;ure, he was quite crazy. But I thought it better not to let him go any farther; for there was no knowing what other freaks he might take into his head; &s;o I told him, that as he did not know how to behave, I could not &s;how him any more of the hou&s;e: and then he began to be very angry in|deed, and &s;aid, he would &s;ee it; and that neither I nor any body el&s;e &s;hould hinder him; and he pro|mi&s;ed he would not do any more mi&s;chief, but as for that man he could not bear to &s;ee him, and he won|dered my mi&s;tre&s;s would let the picture hang there; &s;o as I found that nothing el&s;e would pacify him, I went on, and he was very quiet 'till we came to my mi&s;tre&s;s's dre&s;&s;ing-room, and then when he looked at mi&s;s Percival's picture, &s;tood &s;tock &s;till, ju&s;t as if he was a &s;tatue.</P>
<P>'After he had looked at it for about five minutes, he a&s;ked me, who&s;e picture it was?&mdash;And I told him it was mi&s;s Percival; and then he a&s;ked, 'Is &s;he as beautiful as that picture?' 'Oh, yes,' &s;ays I, 'and a great deal hand&s;omer too.'&mdash;'And &s;he is as &s;weet tem|pered as &s;he is beautiful: I dare &s;ay,' &s;ays he&mdash;'That &s;he is, to be &s;ure,' &s;ays I. 'Then he &s;tared again at it for &s;ome time, and away he walked, without a&s;king to &s;ee the re&s;t of the hou&s;e. Well, the next day he came again, and begged I would let him go up &s;tairs to have another look at mi&s;s Percival's picture; but I po&s;itively told him he &s;hould not &s;ee it; and if he did not go away, I'd call the men, and have him turned away: and then he threw him&s;elf on the ground, and

&s;aid, there h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, 'till he had &s;een the picture, and I told him there he might lie, for he &s;hould not &s;ee it.</P>
<P>'Well, there he did he for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ve half an hour; and then hearing &s;omebody come, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mped up, and ran away. But the third day he came again, and told me that it was in my power to make him the happie&s;t of men, by letting him take a copy of the picture; and if I would do that; he would promi&s;e not to trouble me again. So, at la&s;t, I thought it was the be&s;t way to let him have his wi&s;h, and get rid of him, and I &s;hewed him up &s;tairs&punc; and he took out a pencil, and a bit of paper, and &s;oon copied the picture: then ki&s;&s;ing it eagerly, he put it into his pocket-book, and as he was putting it in, a paper dropped; but I took no notice of it, and when he had &s;hut up the book he ran down &s;tairs, and he was out of the hou&s;e, and out of &s;ight in a moment; then I went up into the dre&s;&s;ing-room again, for the paper I &s;aw him drop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d here it is, &s;aid &s;he, putting a paper into my hand; and I have never &s;een nor heard any thing more of him; and glad enough I was to get rid of him.'</P>
<P>'Such,' &s;aid Mac-Allen, 'was the hou&s;e-keeper's account to me, which &s;urpri&s;ed me very much. I opened the paper, which I found to contain &s;ome ver&s;es, which I was very &s;ure were mr. Percival's hand writing. Do not you think they are, &s;ir?' added he, giving them to me. 'I looked at them, and perfectly coincided with his opinion.' 'Well, &s;ir,' &s;aid he, 'I hardly knew what was be&s;t to be done in &s;uch an odd affair, for I thought it &s;eemed certain that he was a little crazy: however, I determined to make what enquiries I could after him, but all I could learn about the country was, that &s;uch a man as the hou&s;e-keeper de&s;cribed, had been for a week at the public-hou&s;e at Airville, and the people there all thought him crazy. But there was a young man,' added Mac-Allen, 'who was in the hou&s;e at the &s;ame time, &s;taying there for &s;ome days in order to &s;ee the
<PB N="51" REF="038283_0050_1011895703AB4520">
country, and he told me that he had been exceedingly intere&s;ted by this &s;tranger, and thought there mu&s;t be &s;omething particular in his &s;tory. His figure, he &s;aid, was &s;trikingly fine; his eyes beautiful, though carrying in them an expre&s;&s;ion of the deepe&s;t melan|choly. He had a large black patch on one cheek, which appeared, as if put on for a di&s;gui&s;e; and then he wore his hair very much about his face, appa|rently to conceal it. The young man &s;aid, that hav|ing watched him very much, he twice found him &s;it|ting on a piece of rock by the &s;ide of the lake, ear|ne&s;tly intent in gazing on a picture which he always wore fa&s;tened round his neck with a riband; and every now and then he eagerly ki&s;&s;ed it, but as &s;oon as he found he was ob&s;erved, he ha&s;tily returned it into his bo&s;om. He had attempted to enter into con|ver&s;ation with him two or three times, from mere mo|tives of &s;ympathy, but the &s;tranger always &s;hunned all communication with him, and he had not now &s;een any thing of him for three days. This was all the intelligence,' continued Mac-Allen, 'that I could gain, for as to the route which he took on leaving Airville, I could get nothing but the mo&s;t vague con|jectures; &s;ome thought he went to Kin&s;ale; &s;ome to Cork; &s;ome to Waterford; &s;ome to Dublin; but no|thing of certainty could be acquired.'</P>
<P>Such was the relation which doctor Schomberg made to mrs. Percival, and producing the ver&s;es to her &s;he read as follows: <Q><LG>

<P>'Yes, mo&s;t &s;urely it is my Theodore's writing,' &s;aid mrs.

<P>MRS. Percival continued to vi&s;it Hamp&s;hire in the &s;ummer, aad to live in London in the winter, 'till her &s;on was arrived at the age of fifteen, when &s;he &s;up|po&s;ed Antoniette to be approaching to &s;eventeen, a time of life when it was proper &s;he &s;hould be brought out into the world, if that was ever to be done. But difficulties aro&s;e in mrs. Percival's mind with regard to the line of conduct, which it might be proper for her in this ca&s;e to pur&s;ue. Her Theodore had de&s;ired that &s;he might be &s;o educated, as to be fitted to adorn the highe&s;t &s;tation in life, or to be able to get her bread in the lowe&s;t; and &s;he had, therefore, in&s;tructed her in every thing, which &s;he thought was intended to be included in tho&s;e directions.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="038283_0053_1011895CB6F70798">But, could he mean, that with the accompli&s;hments thus be&s;towed on her, &s;he &s;hould be &s;hut up from the world?&mdash;No, &s;urely&mdash;that could not be his object.&mdash; Mrs. Percival wi&s;hed &s;he had been more fully in|formed as to his intentions: but he, probably, at the time he wrote, hardly knew him&s;elf what his views were&mdash;perhaps, indeed, had no views at all. Her coun&s;ellor, doctor Schomberg, could not advi&s;e her in this affair; it was a nice point to decide, and &s;he mu&s;t decide it entirely for her&s;elf. After well weigh|ing the matter, &s;he determined, at la&s;t, that in the en&s;uing winter, &s;he would introduce her into a world, which &s;he was &s;o formed to adorn; well a&s;&s;ured, that her mind was too well guarded again&s;t the allure|ments of that world, to be intoxicated with its plea|&s;ures, or to be unwilling to relinqui&s;h them, &s;hould that hereafter become nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>But, before &s;he was thus to be brought forth into public notice, mrs. Percival thought it would be right, for many rea&s;ons, to make her acquainted with her own hi&s;tory. It might, among other rea&s;ons, be ne|ce&s;&s;ary, in order to put her properly on her guard again&s;t forming any attachment, which might, from her peculiar &s;ituation, be liable to draw her into dif|ficulties. This di&s;covery therefore, &s;he determined to make, the fir&s;t favourable opportunity that pre|&s;ented it&s;elf: and &s;he did not doubt, but many &s;uch would occur in the cour&s;e of the en&s;uing &s;ummer, which it was her intention to &s;pend in Ireland. She had been &s;o long ab&s;ent from that country, that &s;he wi&s;hed much to vi&s;it it again, and, indeed her pre|&s;ence was for many rea&s;ons much wanted there. She left London, therefore, rather earlier in the &s;pring, than u&s;ual, and after a &s;hort &s;tay in Hamp&s;hire, where &s;he was joined by her &s;on, who, &s;he intended, &s;hould accompany her, &s;he &s;et off for Ireland, and arrived at Arlington ca&s;tle the middle of May, ju&s;t &s;even years &s;ince &s;he quitted it.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ntoinette had not lo&s;t the impre&s;&s;ion which the
<PB N="55" REF="038283_0054_1011895FEE895098">
romantic &s;cenes of Arlington, and, indeed, of the whole environs of the lake of Killarney, had formerly made upon her young mind; and now perfect mi&s;|tre&s;s, as &s;he was, of the art of drawing, they appeared to her, beholding them with a &s;cientific eye, ten thou|&s;and times more beautiful and &s;ublime than when &s;he left them. She had been always taught by mrs. Percival, to be above the idle fears of her &s;ex; and not to think it nece&s;&s;ary that &s;he &s;hould have an attendant with her whenever &s;he &s;tirred out. She, therefore, often rambled about by her&s;elf, and took &s;ketches of &s;uch &s;cenes as mo&s;t &s;truck her active fancy.</P>
<P>One day, not very long after their arrival at the ca&s;tle, mrs. Percival being gone out for the day on bu&s;ine&s;s, and Henry and doctor Schomberg for a vi&s;it &s;ome miles off, Antoinette, left alone, amu&s;ed her&s;elf with one of the&s;e rambles, taking a different route from any, which &s;he had gone before. She had wan|dered, at la&s;t, into a delightful little valley, through which ran a &s;mall rivulet, which meandered beauti|fully through a &s;ort of meadow, &s;urrounded with woods, except at one &s;mall interval, which opened on the lake, and where the rivulet emptied it&s;elf down a gentle &s;lope into the lake it&s;elf.&mdash;It was a &s;pot, which &s;eemed formed on purpo&s;e for the pencil; Antoinette was &s;orry &s;he had not provided her&s;elf with her im|plements for drawing; &s;he determined, however, to bring them the next day, and, in the mean time, to &s;urvey the valley round, in order to fix on the pic|ture&s;que &s;pot. Having, at la&s;t, determined on one, &s;he was turning about to go home, when her attention was &s;uddenly arre&s;ted by the appearance of a man, who came out of the wood ju&s;t by the &s;pot where &s;he &s;tood. He was clad in a long, tattered, thread-bare cloak, tied round him with a cord, at the end of which hung a crucifix; on his head he had a coar&s;e woollen cap, from under which appeared a few locks of per|fectly &s;ilver-hair; and he had a long beard, which with with his eye-brows were al&s;o perfect &s;ilver. He
<PB N="56" REF="038283_0055_10118961D9AD2690">
leaned on a &s;taff, which &s;eemed hardly able to &s;up|port his tottering limbs; and his whole appearance was that of extreme want and wretchedne&s;s.</P>
<P>When he perceived Antoinette, he &s;uddenly &s;tarted, by which means his &s;taff &s;lipping he fell down;&mdash;&s;he immediately ha&s;tened to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and having &s;et him again on his feet, he looked &s;tedfa&s;tly up to hea|ven, 'Great God! I thank thee,' &s;aid he, 'for this mercy. I am unworthy to meet with &s;uch compa&s;|&s;ion; but of thy goodne&s;s there is no end. Thou ha&s;t &s;pared my life to enjoy this ble&s;&s;ed moment, and I &s;hall now die content.&mdash;Ble&s;&s;ed be thy name, Oh God, throughout all nations and generations!'&mdash;When he had fini&s;hed this ejaculation, he turned again, and looking &s;tedfa&s;tly at her, he was &s;eized with a fit of trembling, and fell again to the ground;&mdash;&s;he again held out her hand to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, but in a moment rai&s;ing him&s;elf on his knees, and lifting up his hands and eyes to heaven in the utmo&s;t ec&s;tacy, he exclaimed, 'And is this the angel form, which my &s;oul has &s;o long panted to behold?&mdash;Heaven and earth!&mdash;Can it be?&mdash;Let me look at her again: Yes, yes! 'Tis &s;he her&s;elf!&mdash;Tho&s;e eyes, that lovely bloom.'&mdash;He was overcome with agitation, and &s;unk down again on the ground.</P>
<P>Antoinette was motionle&s;s with a&s;toni&s;hment, at all &s;he heard and &s;aw; nor could tell, what &s;he ought to think of it.&mdash;She had heard of &s;trange effects pro|duced by religious enthu&s;ia&s;m; but could this mo&s;t unaccountable &s;ally proceed from that cau&s;e only? She, however, held out her hands again to a&s;&s;i&s;t him.</P>
<P>'My good friend,' &s;aid &s;he. 'What is the mat|ter?&mdash;Are you ill?&mdash;Accept of my a&s;&s;i&s;tance.'</P>
<P>'Ah!' &s;aid he, 'from &s;uch hands, who could re|fu&s;e it? Yet, oh! will it not contaminate thy pu|rity to touch a wretch like me?' Then making a great effort he rai&s;ed him&s;elf up, and leaning upon his &s;taff&mdash;'Re&s;olve me, &s;weet angel,' &s;aid he, 'from whence do you come?&mdash;Where do you live?'</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="038283_0056_101189644D2E0600">'Ju&s;t by,' &s;he replied, 'at Arlington ca&s;tle.'</P>
<P>'And are you the daughter of lord Arlington?'</P>
<P>'I am.'</P>
<P>'No more, no more!' he cried, ''tis too much, too much! This tide of joy, I cannot bear!&mdash;Leave me, leave me, at pre&s;ent, but'&mdash;and here he gave a look of the mo&s;t anxious &s;olicitude&mdash;'May I a&s;k it? &mdash;Will you keep this adventure &s;ecret, and meet me here this time to-morrow?&mdash;You need not fear me&mdash;there was a time when, indeed, you would not have been &s;afe in my hands&mdash;but now for worlds I would not harm you&mdash;to-morrow I &s;hall be more compo&s;ed; this interview has quite overcome me.'&mdash; He pau&s;ed, as expecting her an&s;wer.</P>
<P>'I &s;hall come to this &s;pot again to-morrow.' Then he added, 'and may I hope? Yes, heaven will &s;urely in&s;pire you with confidence to meet me&mdash;Your heart is, as I have witne&s;&s;ed, the throne of benevolence; three times to-day have you &s;tretched out the arm of charity to rai&s;e a fallen wretch; heaven ble&s;s and re|ward thee!' So &s;aying, he returned into the wood, from whence he had come, and Antoinette &s;oon lo&s;t &s;ight of him.</P>
<P>She remained for &s;ome minutes fixed to the &s;pot where he had left her, lo&s;t in a&s;toni&s;hment, at what had pa&s;&s;ed; at la&s;t &s;he turned homewards, pondering in her mind whether &s;he &s;hould comply with the old man's reque&s;t or not. At length &s;he determined &s;o far to &s;werve from it, as not to keep the matter &s;ecret, but to impart it to mrs. Percival, when &s;he &s;hould re|turn home, and be determined by her opinion whether to meet the old man or not. But before that opinion could be obtained, Antoinette was called on to act from her feelings, rather than from deliberation.</P>
<P>About a mile from the ca&s;tle lived a catholic prie&s;t, a man of the utmo&s;t worth and benevolence, who&s;e time was wholly employed in working all the good in his power in the neighbourhood. As he had re|&s;ided in the &s;ame &s;pot for &s;ome time before mrs. Per|cival
<PB N="58" REF="038283_0057_101189678BE3BF38">
had left the country, he was well known to her, and had occa&s;ionally been at the hou&s;e; he was, there|fore, no &s;tranger to Antoinette, and had, indeed, al|ways taken particular notice of that amiable girl, who on her part, was always plea&s;ed with, and re|turned, his attentions.</P>
<P>She had not been returned home above two hours, before this benevolent man came to the hou&s;e, and de&s;iring to &s;peak with her, was immediately &s;hewn into the room where &s;he was &s;itting. As &s;he had not &s;een him before &s;ince her return, &s;he &s;prang forward with great eagerne&s;s at hearing his name announced, and taking him by the hand, expre&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t plea&s;ure at &s;eeing him again; and he, on his part, expre&s;&s;ed equal delight at her return into tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>'But, my dear mi&s;s Percival,' &s;aid he, 'we mu&s;t not wa&s;te time in compliments, I have bu&s;ine&s;s of importance to impart to you.&mdash;Have you not this morning &s;een, and conver&s;ed with an old hermit?'</P>
<P>Antoinete an&s;wered, that &s;he had, and that he had reque&s;ted her to meet him on the &s;ame &s;pot again to|morrow, which &s;he intended to do, if her mother &s;hould approve of it.</P>
<P>'I have ju&s;t now left that old man,' &s;aid the prie&s;t, 'who &s;eemed very near approaching to his la&s;t mo|ments, and who expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t anxious de&s;ire to &s;ee you again before he expires. Will you grant his reque&s;t, madam? I am &s;ure it will calm his la&s;t mo|ments&mdash;You may tru&s;t your&s;elf to me, my character is well known to you&mdash; I will conduct you to his cell &mdash;it is little more than a mile from hence, and I will be re&s;pon&s;ible for your &s;afety.'</P>
<P>Antoinette was more and more a&s;toni&s;hed&mdash;'Me!' &s;he cried, 'What can he po&s;&s;ibly want with me?'&mdash; But he &s;hall be gratified; you would not a&s;k me, I know, to do what is improper&mdash;I will then accom|pany you.' She immediately put on her hat and cloak, and &s;et out with the prie&s;t. As they walked together, &s;he enquired of him, who this man was,

and how long he had been in the country?' When he gave her the following relation.</P>
<P>'It is now near &s;even years, madam, &s;ince he fir&s;t appeared here, in all which time no one has been able to learn any thing of his &s;tory. When he at fir&s;t came he took up his abode entirely in the open air, lying down at night on the ground among&s;t the woods, not even taking &s;helter in the cavity of a rock, and living in every re&s;pect a mo&s;t au&s;tere life. I had often met him by chance, before I ventured to &s;peak to him; but, at la&s;t, I broke &s;ilence, by ob&s;erving, that he &s;eemed to have no habitation, and, as winter was coming on, he was in danger of peri&s;hing, if he con|tinued thus expo&s;ed to the inclemencies of the wea|ther.'</P>
<P>'He replied, that a wretch like him, could not be too much expo&s;ed to hard&s;hips&mdash;Penances and mor|tifications were the only road by which he could hope to reconcile him&s;elf to an offended deity,' adding, 'the world hardly contains &s;uch another wretch, &s;uch a mon&s;ter as I am!'&mdash;He then fell on his face to the earth, but &s;tarted up again, 'No,' &s;aid he, 'I dare not pray!&mdash;prayer from me would be downright bla&s;phemy!&mdash;Pray for me, father, your ori&s;ons may be accepted; mine never can be.' After &s;ome fur|ther conver&s;ation with him, finding that &s;ome actions of his life filled his &s;oul with angui&s;h and remor&s;e, I pre&s;&s;ed him to unbo&s;om him&s;elf to me, and make me his confe&s;&s;or, and in time he might obtain ab&s;olution.'</P>
<P>'No,' &s;aid he, 'I have an oath regi&s;tered above, a &s;olemn oath&mdash;I have &s;worn by the mo&s;t high God, the ruler of heaven and earth, never to reveal my &s;ecret, unle&s;s&mdash;" Here he pau&s;ed&mdash;he remained motionle&s;s for &s;ome minutes, with his eyes fixed upwards&mdash;'No,' &s;aid he, 'ab&s;olution I cannot have&mdash;Even the mercy of the Almighty can never pardon a wretch like me; and &s;hall man then dare to pretend to it?'</P>

&s;ince that time had much intercour&s;e with him, and with &s;ome difficulty prevailed on him at la&s;t to fit him&s;elf up in a cell in one of the rocks which &s;ur|rounded the lake, where at fir&s;t he would only have a little &s;traw to lie on, and one chair, but by degrees I have per&s;uaded him to get a bed and &s;ome other conveniencies. Frequent conver&s;ations have pa&s;&s;ed between us, in all of which I have found him a man of poli&s;hed manners, with a great knowledge of the world, and no incon&s;iderable &s;hare of learning. His favourite topic of conver&s;ation is, the dreadful effects of giving way to one's pa&s;&s;ions and appetites, even in the &s;malle&s;t degree, and I am convinced he has been guilty of &s;ome dreadful crime, in con&s;equence of not having controlled his pa&s;&s;ions; but what that crime may be, or whether, indeed, it is one crime in parti|cular or that in general he has &s;een horrible effects ari&s;e in various ways, from his &s;uffering tho&s;e pa&s;|&s;ions to rule him at all times, I cannot with any de|ci&s;ion determine: but I rather think that there is &s;ome one particular offence, which thus weighs him down.</P>
<P>'He is a wonderful adopt in languages, and &s;peaks both French and Engli&s;h &s;o equally well, that I do not know of which country to gue&s;s him to be, though I rather &s;uppo&s;e him to be of England, or Ireland, be|cau&s;e he &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ems perfectly well acquainted with the hi&s;tory of lord Arlington and his family.

He then re|turned it to his pillow; but recovering from his illne&s;s, he has never &s;ince &s;poken to me on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>'He had often enquired, madam, with great anxiety, whether lord Arlington had a daughter, and expre&s;&s;ed his wonder that the family never came to the ca&s;tle. When the fir&s;t intelligence arrived here of mrs. Percival's intention to &s;pend the &s;ummer among&s;t us, I informed him of it; he &s;eemed rather agitated. I al&s;o told him of the family's arrival, as &s;oon as I knew of that event; but he &s;eemed to take little notice of it at the time, though I have ob&s;erved that ever &s;ince that time, he has appeared re&s;tle&s;s and unea&s;y more than u&s;ual, and has almo&s;t always been rambling about, which is contrary to his u&s;ual practice.</P>
<P>'This morning I met him at the entrance of his cell, pale, agitated, tottering, and with every &s;ymptom of approaching death; I &s;upported him into the cell&punc; when he &s;unk down on his bed, and gra&s;ping my hand, &s;aid,'</P>

<P>'I was a&s;toni&s;hed at his words, and could not, at fir&s;t, comprehend their meaning&mdash;he lay &s;till and &s;ilent a few minutes, then &s;tarting up, he exclaimed,</P>
<P>'In peace!&mdash;No. I cannot die in peace, unle&s;s I &s;ee her again&mdash;Will &s;he come to me?'</P>

<P>'It is pa&s;t; I am my&s;elf again; but the &s;hock has been too much for me.'&mdash;He then related to me the

<P>Antoinette li&s;tened to the prie&s;t's relation with the utmo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment, nor could form in her mind any idea, which could give her the lea&s;t clue to &s;o extra|ordinary an affair. Perhaps, had &s;he been acquainted with her own &s;tory, &s;u&s;picions might have ari&s;en in her mind, that &s;he was about to hear great di&s;coveries; but ignorant as &s;he was of that, the matter &s;eemed totally inexplicable. At length &s;he arrived with her conductor at the cell; on entering which, they found the hermit &s;tretched on his bed in the agonies of death, yet &s;till with &s;o much &s;en&s;e, as to give a look of &s;atisfaction at &s;eeing them. Antoinette &s;at down by him, and involuntarily took hold of his hand; it was cold as the rocky floor of his habitation. He fixed his dying eyes upon her. Twice he e&s;&s;ayed to &s;peak: but the overflowings of his &s;oul were too mighty for utterance. He made a &s;ign to the prie&s;t to take the ca&s;ket from under his pillow, which having done, he again made a &s;ign that it &s;hould be put into the hands of Antoinette, and making a great effort he ju&s;t ut|tered, in a voice &s;carcely audible, ''Tis of impor|tance to you.' He then rai&s;ed his hands and eyes to heaven&mdash;'Heaven bl&mdash;;' a ble&s;&s;ing hung on his lips &mdash;he was unable to utter it&mdash;his hands fell&mdash;his eye|lids clo&s;ed&mdash;his bo&s;om heaved&mdash; he expired.</P>
<P>Antoinette, by an involuntary impul&s;e, again took hold of his hand, and pre&s;&s;ed it to her bo&s;om. What a &s;cene was here formed for a painter's eye!&mdash;the hermit &s;tretched on his mi&s;erable bed, a breathle&s;s corp&s;e; his aged and &s;orrow-worn features yet di&s;|playing the mingled emotions which agitated his part|ing &s;oul; one hand fa&s;t locked in that of the lovely

<P>It was &s;ome time before this intere&s;ting and affect|ing &s;cene received any interruption; but the prie&s;t at la&s;t taking Antoinette by the hand, propo&s;ed her returning to the ca&s;tle; to which &s;he a&s;&s;ented, and taking the ca&s;ket with her, they proceeded thither together in perfect &s;ilence,</P>

<P>'Indeed, madam, you are right,' returned the prie&s;t. 'The &s;tory is an extraordinary one.&mdash; Come, madam,' then he continued, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Antoinette, 'Shall I leave mrs. Percival and you to talk it over at your lei&s;ure?'</P>
<P>'Oh! no,' an&s;wered Antoinette, 'Pray do not leave us:&mdash;I &s;hall want you to a&s;&s;i&s;t my recollection with regard to the poor hermit&mdash;I will tell my mo|ther all that I know; but you, perhaps, will recol|lect &s;ome further circum&s;tances with regard to his abode in the&s;e parts.'</P>
<P>'Come then into the parlour;' &s;aid mrs Percival; &mdash;they all went in, and being &s;eated, Antoinette re|lated what had pa&s;&s;ed that day relative to the old man; and concluded with producing the ca&s;ket, which, &s;he told mrs. Percival, &s;he had determined not to open but in her pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Mrs. Percival heard the relation with no le&s;s a&s;to|ni&s;hment, than the whole tran&s;action had excited in Antoinette.

&s;eemed &s;urpri&s;ing&mdash;be&s;ides, it was evident too at that time, that he wi&s;hed to remain in concealment. Yes, &s;he was convinced it mu&s;t be her Theodore.</P>
<P>But, why not &s;atisfy her&s;elf at once by vi&s;iting the corp&s;e?&mdash;&s;he &s;hould then no longer remain in doubt: The prie&s;t &s;aid too that &s;orrow, rather than age; &s;eemed to have brought him to the grave. Alas! how much had her Theodore been a prey to &s;orrow, even before he left her? And what havoc might not fifteen &s;ub&s;equent years of &s;orrow have made in his frame? All the&s;e reflections pa&s;&s;ed rapidly in her bo|&s;om: for to Antoinette, who was yet unacquainted with the true &s;tate of the family, &s;he could not ab|ruptly impart the&s;e &s;u&s;picions: &s;he &s;at therefore re|volving them in her mind, without uttering a word; but at times clapping her hand on her forehead, as if ab&s;orbed in meditation.&mdash;At length &s;he begged of the prie&s;t to accompany her into another room.</P>
<P>When they were arrived there &s;he a&s;ked him 'Whe|ther he had never any rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that this man was her hu&s;band? Yet why do I a&s;k that que&s;tion? &s;he added. 'Had you ever entertained &s;uch &s;u&s;pi|cions, you would &s;urely have communicated them to me.&mdash;Nay, indeed, you mu&s;t at once have known my Theodore.'</P>
<P>'Pardon me, madam,' he an&s;wered, 'You will recollect that I did not &s;ettle in the&s;e parts 'till very &s;oon after mr. Percival's abrupt departure; but hav|ing, at my fir&s;t coming here, heard much of that tragical affair, as it was then the principal topic of conver&s;ation in the neighbourhood, and con&s;equently being no &s;tranger to the &s;tory, I own I have been &s;ometimes led to &s;u&s;pect that this might be the hu&s;|band who has co&s;t you &s;o many hours of &s;orrow. And I have therefore been always particularly atten|tive to catch at any thing which might remove or confirm my &s;u&s;picions.

<P>'I did indeed long ago impart the &s;tory, by letter, to doctor Schomberg; at the &s;ame time con&s;ulting him whether it &s;hould be imparted to you or not, and de&s;iring him to act in the affair according to his own di&s;cretion. But he agreed with me in opinion, that without more grounds to go upon, it was better not to hara&s;s your mind at all on the matter. Doctor Schomberg, &s;ince his arrival here, has &s;everal times attempted to &s;ee the old man; though, as he &s;aid, mr. Percival was &s;o little known to him, that he &s;hould have had difficulty in recollecting his features, e&s;pe|cially under &s;o different an appearance; but, madam, as the hermit, contrary to his u&s;ual cu&s;tom, has &s;carcely ever been in his cell &s;ince your arrival at the ca&s;tle, doctor Schomberg has never been able to ob|tain a &s;ight of him.'</P>
<P>'But,' &s;aid mrs. Percival, 'has Mac-Allen never &s;een him?'</P>
<P>'Yes,' replied the prie&s;t, 'he has &s;een him very frequently; but he has always &s;aid he did not think he could po&s;&s;ibly be his ma&s;ter; for though, to be &s;ure, he was about his &s;tature, and very much re&s;em|bled him in per&s;on, excepting that he was bent, with weakne&s;s, he does not think that eight years of &s;orrow and fatigue could have given a man of mr. Percival's years, &s;uch an appearance of age, as this hermit had, even at his fir&s;t arrival.&mdash;Of this, however,' continued the prie&s;t, 'I am well a&s;&s;ured, from many circum|&s;tances, that the hermit knew a great deal of mr.

<P>'Well, then, it &s;hall be &s;o,' an&s;wered mrs. Perci|val, 'to-morrow morning we will meet there; in the mean time, I mu&s;t go through the painful ta&s;k of open|ing to my dear charge her true &s;tory.

Perhaps I have been wrong in not imparting it to her before; but I have always dreaded, le&s;t the knowledge of it might be a means of abating the friend&s;hip in which we have hitherto lived.'</P>
<P>The prie&s;t now took his leave; and mrs. Percival returned to Antoinette, who, filled with a&s;toni&s;hment at what had pa&s;&s;ed, &s;at impatiently waiting for her; &s;he could not conceive the rea&s;on why her mother had not made any remark on the &s;tory of the hermit; or why &s;he &s;hould &s;o immediately de&s;ire a private con|ference with the prie&s;t; yet as &s;he knew, that there was &s;omething rather my&s;terious relative to mr.

<P>Mrs. Percival, on entering the room, &s;aw plainly what was pa&s;&s;ing in the mind of Antoinette, and that &s;he wi&s;hed to know much more than perhaps &s;he thought it was proper for her to enquire.

<P>If Antoinette had been &s;urpri&s;ed with what had pa&s;&s;ed relative to the old hermit, how much more was &s;he a&s;toni&s;hed, and how much was &s;he &s;hocked at what mrs.

But now and I was&mdash;'</P>
<P>Mrs. Percival interrupted her. 'Do not talk of a

Ob&s;erve the words of my Theodore, 'Her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">th is lawful, her parents illu&s;|trious;' and, let us hope that it may be a part of the &s;cheme of Providence, that you &s;hould one day know them.&mdash;Why then &s;uppo&s;e your&s;elf degraded, by finding that you are not my daughter? Be comforted, my child, be a&s;&s;ured. &mdash;Here they were interrupted by the arrival of Henry, and doctor Schomberg, who returned from their day's excur&s;ion.</P>
<P>Henry was entering, with all the ardour of a youthful mind, delighted with his day's entertainment, and eager to relate the particulars of it;&mdash;but his ar|dour was damped in a moment, when he beheld Antoinette in tears, and with all the &s;ymptoms, in her countenance, of the deepe&s;t affliction, and mrs. Percival, with the tendere&s;t affection, endeavouring to con&s;ole her. His eyes, which had &s;parkled with plea&s;ure, were in a moment expre&s;&s;ive of nothing but anxiety.</P>
<P>'What is the matter with my dear &s;i&s;ter?' &s;aid he, eagerly.</P>
<P>'My love,' &s;aid mrs. Percival, 'You &s;hall know pre&s;ently.'</P>
<P>'I hope &s;o,' &s;aid he. 'I hope my &s;i&s;ter will never know a &s;orrow, in which her brother will not be al|lowed to participate.'</P>
<P>Antoinette gave him a look full of gratitude and affection, but could not make him any other reply.</P>
<P>'Come, my Antoinette,' &s;aid mrs. Percival, 'You and doctor Schomberg will, perhaps, take a walk in the garden; you may talk freely with him, and the air will be of &s;ervice to you&mdash;I would have half an hour's conver&s;ation with Henry alone.'</P>
<P>Doctor Schomberg went out with Antoinette, when mrs. Percival related to Henry all that &s;he had before imparted to his &s;uppo&s;ed &s;i&s;ter. He heard the &s;tory
<PB N="71" REF="038283_0070_1011898414110DF0">
with no le&s;s a&s;toni&s;hment, than &s;he had, done: and when his mother had fini&s;hed, he looked at her with the mo&s;t earne&s;t mixture of anxiety and apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>'But I hope we are not to lo&s;e Antoinette?' he &s;aid.</P>
<P>'Heaven forbid, that we &s;hould!' returned mrs. Percival.&mdash;'No, &s;he will &s;till be my daughter.'</P>
<P>'And my &s;i&s;ter too?' &s;aid he, anxiou&s;ly.</P>
<P>'I hope &s;o,' &s;he an&s;wered. 'I hope, my love, you will not cea&s;e to regard her as &s;uch.'</P>
<P>'Oh, no,' he replied, 'I &s;hould dread nothing &s;o much (next to lo&s;ing you, deare&s;t madam, as a mother) as lo&s;ing Antoinette for a &s;i&s;ter. We have been edu|cated under the &s;ame roof, as brother and &s;i&s;ter, and have lived in the pure&s;t friend&s;hip as &s;uch; and life would be but a blank to me,' &s;aid he, putting his handkerchief up to his eyes, 'if that friend&s;hip was to be de&s;troyed.'&mdash;Here he could contain him&s;elf no longer, but fairly &s;obbed out, and let his tears have their free cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Mrs. Percival &s;aw them with delight, nor could &s;he forbear to mingle hers with them: and taking her &s;on's hand, 'Ah! my Henry,' &s;he &s;aid, 'dear as you have always been to my &s;oul, I never loved you to the exce&s;s I do at this moment.&mdash;This affection for your &s;i&s;ter&mdash;'tis charming&mdash;'tis enchanting!' She eagerly ki&s;&s;ed him. 'How have I dreaded this moment!' &s;he &s;aid. 'It was one of the greate&s;t con|&s;olations of my life to &s;ee your affection for each other. I dreaded le&s;t this di&s;covery &s;hould interrupt it.&mdash;Go then, my &s;on, ha&s;ten to Antoinette. She will anxiou&s;ly expect the event of this interview; and your renewed a&s;&s;urances of fraternal affection, will be one of the be&s;t of cordials to her wounded heart.'</P>
<P>Henry went out immediately to &s;eek for Antoi|nette: and mrs. Percival retired to her room, in or|der to compo&s;e her &s;pirits, after the affecting &s;cenes &s;he had gone through. She had not been arrived there many minutes before &s;he &s;aw&mdash;the fading light of evening ju&s;t &s;erving to di&s;play the intere&s;ting &s;cene&mdash;
<PB N="72" REF="038283_0071_10118986A17D97D8">
Henry run up to Antoinette, who, whih doctor Schombergh, was &s;eated on a bench in the garden, and cla&s;ping her in his arms, ki&s;s her with the utmo&s;t warmth of fraternal affection. Mrs. Percival, quite overcome, bur&s;t into a torrent of tears, which &s;he did not for a while endeavour to repre&s;s. Her feelings had been wrought up to a pitch which required, that they &s;hould have &s;uch a vent: and &s;he found her mind grow more compo&s;ed by giving way to them for a while.</P>
<P>Henry, in the mean time, gave Antoinette the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urances of his unalterable affection for her; a&s;&s;ured her that he could never cea&s;e to con&s;ider her as his &s;i&s;ter, and to love her as &s;uch; and conjured her &s;till to love him as a brother. She returned this bur&s;t of affection with reciprocal a&s;&s;urances on her part, that nothing could wound her bo&s;om more deeply, than the thoughts of lo&s;ing his friend&s;hip; and &s;oon after this family of harmony a&s;&s;embled round the &s;upper table with, if po&s;&s;ible, even increa&s;ed af|fection to each other.</P>
<P>After &s;upper, Antoinette proceeded to examine the ca&s;ket, which &s;he had received from the hermit. She, therefore, unbound the paper, which was tied upon it, which only contained a reque&s;t to the prie&s;t to de|liver the ca&s;ket into no other hands, than tho&s;e of Antoinette, daughter to Theodore, lord Arlington, and which &s;eemed only meant as a provi&s;ion, in ca&s;e he had not the opportunity of placing it in her hands him&s;elf. On opening the ca&s;ket, Antoinette found a letter directed to her&s;elf; a &s;ealed packet of papers, a cro&s;s of very &s;plendid diamonds; and a very &s;mall miniature picture of a lady; the extreme likene&s;s of which to Antoinette &s;truck every one pre&s;ent. The letter contained as follows:</P>
<P>'In your hands, unfortunate maiden, I place a &s;acred depo&s;it, the&s;e papers, this cro&s;s, and this pic|ture: let not the former be opened, 'till you have found a long lo&s;t father, whom I have made wretched;
<PB N="73" REF="038283_0072_10118988F1338138">
in placing the&s;e in your hands, however, I endeavour, as far as lies in my power, to atone for the injuries I have done him&mdash;for the mi&s;ery which he as endured in con&s;equence of my giving way to uncontrolled pa&s;&s;ion. Oh! would to God, that the pa&s;t could be recalled! But if fifteen years of mi&s;ery and remor&s;e can atone for my offences, I may hope hereafter to find that peace, which I have never known on earth. Wear the cro&s;s, and picture, con&s;tantly about you! &mdash;They are precious relics; had their former own|ers been alive, how dear would you have been to them! May the God of Heaven ever ble&s;s you, &s;weet maid, and may he have mercy on my &s;oul!'</P>
<P>New wonders were now opened to them; and mrs. Percival felt more and more convinced, that this man was her Theodore; he talked of fifteen years of mi&s;ery and remor&s;e, and it was ju&s;t fifteen years &s;ince he left her.&mdash;But what could he mean by having made the father of Antoinette wretched?&mdash;Could Joanna have been &s;educed by him from her hu&s;band? And could Antoinette be the child of Joanna by her hu&s;band? Yet, &s;urely, Theodore had a &s;oul incapa|ble of &s;o great villany; he had always appeared to have a high &s;en&s;e of moral rectitude!&mdash;She was perplexed beyond mea&s;ure, as &s;he revolved the&s;e things in her mind, and was impatient for the morn|ing, when &s;he &s;hould &s;ee the corp&s;e.</P>
<P>The morning, at length arrived, when mrs. Per|cival, accompanied by Henry, Antoinette, and doc|tor Schomberg repaired to the hermit's cell, where they found the benevolent prie&s;t &s;inging a r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">quiem for his departed &s;oul. Mrs. Percival earne&s;tly exa|mined the features of the corp&s;e. She thought &s;he di&s;covered &s;ome faint traces of tho&s;e of her hu&s;band. But age was imprinted on the countenance of the de|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, beyond what &s;he could po&s;&s;ibly expect to have
<PB N="74" REF="038283_0073_1011898AC168FA28">
found in him. Yet why? &s;orrow and fatigue will produce the effects of age on the form and features, and fifteen years were a long time for tho&s;e cau&s;es to have operated.&mdash;She looked again. She a&s;ked doctor Schomberg's opinion.&mdash;He had not much knowledge of mr. Percival, and was, therefore, but an indifferent judge; but he owned, he thought there was a con&s;iderable re&s;emblance; that is, that the coun|tenance of the hermit was &s;uch as mr. Percival's might be &s;uppo&s;ed to have become from age and mi&s;|fortunes.</P>
<P>Mrs. Percival looked again and again at the coun|tenance. &mdash;She grew more and more convinced that this object of mi&s;ery was the once charming Theo|dore Percival; and in this conviction, almo&s;t invo|luntarily, took his clay-cold hand, pre&s;&s;ed it to her lips, and bathed it with her tears; and with this con|viction &s;he returned home, ordering that the corp&s;e &s;hould be depo&s;ited in a private manner, in a vault belonging to the family of Arlington.</P>
<P>Yet amid&s;t all this conviction, one doubt &s;till aro&s;e in her mind.&mdash;She could by no means, if this was her hu&s;band, account for his thus leaving her in doubt, as to his fate; but, again, &s;he recollected that he had told the prie&s;t that his &s;tory would not die with him; and there might be rea&s;ons, why he would not yet have it developed. The prie&s;t called again;&mdash;he had been &s;earching the cell, but could find nothing in it, except the little furniture he had, a Latin Bible and Te&s;tament, and the Roman Mi&s;&s;al; which three books he had brought to Antoinette, as the hermit &s;eemed to have &s;elected her for the dep&ocirc;t of his few effects.</P>
<P>Mrs. Percival took this opportunity of putting &s;ome farther que&s;tions to him concerning the object of her curio&s;ity, but could gain little more information. The hermit was active and diligent to exce&s;s (the prie&s;t &s;aid) in admini&s;tering to the wants of the neighbouring poor, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> as his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ans would allow;
<PB N="75" REF="038283_0074_1011898C5AC6A8F8">
but his means &s;eemed &s;lender, and I could never make out, madam, continued the prie&s;t, from what &s;ource even the little he had, was derived. He u&s;ed to teach the poor children to read, purcha&s;ing for them &s;uch little books as he could procure at Killarney; and the children were always fond of him, and u&s;ed to gather round him whenever they &s;aw him: but, except for purpo&s;es of benevolence, he &s;eldom left his cell. I have often gone there, and conver&s;ed with him; and at fir&s;t, in tho&s;e conver&s;ations, I endeavoured to give them &s;uch a turn, as might draw him in&s;en&s;ibly into revealing his &s;tory; but he was aware of my de&s;igns, and always eluded me, and, at length, one day &s;aid, 'I &s;ee your drift plainly, my good friend; but you will not &s;ucceed. I have told you that I have an oath re|gi&s;tered above, never to di&s;clo&s;e my &s;tory during my life, unle&s;s I am &s;o fortunate as to &s;ee&mdash;.' There he pau&s;ed&mdash;looked earne&s;tly at me, but without any appearance of anger; then continued, 'Do not then entertain &s;o ill an opinion of me, as to &s;uppo&s;e that I &s;hall not be watchful &s;trictly &s;o ob&s;erve that oath. I have been wicked&mdash;very wicked. Few people in the world, perhaps, have greater enormities to account for than I have&mdash;yet I know how to revere an oath&mdash; I might be ra&s;h in making it. On that matter I will not pretend to determine; but as I have made it, the world united, &s;hould not force me to violate it.'</P>
<P>'There was &s;omething &s;o uncommonly impre&s;&s;ive and energetic in his manner, as he &s;pake the&s;e words, that I could never afterwards think of attempting to draw his &s;ecret from him. But I have always watched his countenance and manner, when any &s;pecies of crime has become the &s;ubject of our conver&s;ation; yet, though he at &s;uch times would expre&s;s the greate&s;t horror at the crime mentioned, I could never ob&s;erve him more agitated by one thing than another. But free in his cen&s;ures of vice in general, and of his own conduct in particular, he has &s;till ob&s;erved &s;uch
<PB N="76" REF="038283_0075_101189909E999E40">
uniform caution, that I could never perceive one &s;ub|ject particularly touch him.'</P>
<P>From all this mrs. Percival could find nothing &s;atis|factory&mdash;nothing which could tend to a&s;&s;ure her either of the truth or fal&s;ehood of her conjectures. She thanked the prie&s;t for the trouble he had taken in this affair, and entreated him, if ever he gained any intelligence, which could tend to throw light on it, that he would immediately impart it to her, which he promi&s;ing to do, retired.</P>

<P>FOR &s;ome time this affair entirely engro&s;&s;ed the at|tention of mrs. Percival and her family. But no fre&s;h incidents concerning it occurring, it, at length, &s;unk gradually, though not into oblivion, yet into that kind of &s;tate, that it was no longer talked of, nor inter|rupted their attention to other concerns, and they re&s;ted in &s;ilent hope, that time would make farther di&s;coveries.</P>
<P>They now began to be vi&s;ited by the neighbours,
<PB N="77" REF="038283_0076_1011899289D00A08">
among&s;t whom were many people, who&s;e &s;ociety they found very plea&s;ant. But the family, who&s;e com|pany was mo&s;t agreeable to them, was that of a mr. Delaval, who had hired mrs. Percival's hou&s;e at Air|ville, where, it will be remembered, &s;he had lived with her father before her marriage. Mr. Delaval was a widower, with one &s;on and one daughter, the latter about the age of Antoinette, the former four years older than his &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Mr. Delaval had &s;ome years back been re&s;ident in Italy for a con&s;iderable time, on account of the ill &s;tate of his wife's health, who died at Florence &s;oon after the birth of Caroline Delaval, but he remained at Flo|rence for &s;ome time after that event. At his return from Italy, he &s;ettled near Dublin for &s;ome years, and had taken Airville hou&s;e only about four years before the time we are now &s;peaking of. His being tenant to mrs. Percival, of cour&s;e brought the two fa|milies together, when they became near neighbours, and congeniality of di&s;po&s;ition &s;oon improved their ac|quaintance into the clo&s;e&s;t intimacy.</P>
<P>Mr. Delaval and his family were all of a very mu|&s;ical turn; he him&s;elf was a very fine performer both on the violin and violoncello. Francis, his &s;on, ex|celled on the flute, and could al&s;o play a good &s;econd to his father on the violin, and Caroline &s;ung charm|ingly. When this family and mrs. Percival's were together, therefore, they made very plea&s;ant little con|certs. Henry Percival, who&s;e ta&s;te for mu&s;ic was not inferior to that of his mother's and Antoinette's, had for &s;ome time practi&s;ed on the hautboy, on which he had attained a con&s;iderable degree of excellence, and could join with his voice in a glee: and mrs. Percival and Antoinette, as has been &s;aid already, both played on the piano-forte, and &s;ung in a very &s;uperior &s;tile.</P>
<P>They were particularly fond of exerci&s;ing their mu|&s;ical talents in little parties on the &s;ide of the lake, or upon it, where the echoes reverberating from the &s;ur|rounding mountains, added a fine effect to the mu&s;ic,
<PB N="78" REF="038283_0077_101189945E40EB38">
which effect was much heightened by two excellent French-horn players, who lived at Killarney, and whom they u&s;ually hired to be of their parties on &s;uch occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>One afternoon they had been on one of the&s;e par|ties upon the lake, and the weather being remarkably fine, they were induced by it to lengthen out their ex|cur&s;ion 'till moon-light, when perhaps a more &s;ooth|ing and captivating &s;eene could hardly be witne&s;&s;ed. The air was perfectly &s;till, no breeze ru&s;tled among&s;t the &s;urrounding trees, or ruffled the &s;erenity of the waters, on which the moon bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> played with the mo&s;t beautiful lu&s;tre, except where the lengthened &s;hadows of the over-arching rocks ca&s;t a deep gloom on them, which only &s;erved, by contra&s;t, to heighten the beauty of the &s;cene; at intervals they &s;ang and played pieces and &s;ongs adapted to the &s;cene; at others, no &s;ound intervened but the da&s;hing of the oars in the water.</P>
<P>As they advanced towards the &s;hore, Antoinette began to &s;ing the &s;ong of 'Sweet Echo,' from Milton's beautiful poem of Comus, when a hautboy from the &s;hore an&s;wered her with &s;ounds that &s;eemed to come from one of more than human mould; it conveyed an idea of the mu&s;ic of the &s;pheres. The company were a&s;toni&s;hed, were enchanted;&mdash;again, as &s;he proceeded, &s;he was an&s;wered by the &s;ame &s;ounds, or even &s;weeter than before. Mrs. Percival trembled and turned pale&mdash;&s;he knew that her hu&s;band had been a per|former on that in&s;trument, when fir&s;t he returned from his travels, and though he had never pur&s;ued it, from want of &s;pirits to go through any &s;uch exer|tion, yet &s;he did not know what might have happened during his ab&s;ence, to draw him on &s;uch a pur&s;uit; and being always eager to catch at any thing like a &s;hadow of hope on the grand &s;ubject that occupied her mind, without, at the fir&s;t impul&s;e, ab&s;olutely knowing a good rea&s;on for the idea &s;he harboured, &s;he exclaimed, 'Good heavens! who can this en|chanting
<PB N="79" REF="038283_0078_10118996DDACA248">
mu&s;ician be?'&mdash;but &s;he recollected, and checked her&s;elf&mdash;when mr. Delaval &s;aid, 'Oh! What melody! &s;ure never was any thing &s;o fine;' &mdash;again he li&s;tened&mdash;again exclaimed&mdash;'What a &s;train was that,&mdash;Oh! if I were on the &s;ilver Arno, in&s;tead of the lake of Killarney, I &s;hould &s;ay that it mu&s;t be count Mar&s;ini him&s;elf; for never did I hear &s;uch &s;trains but from him.'</P>
<P>Antoinette fini&s;hed her &s;ong, and in a minute or two the hautboy began playing again, an Italian air, in &s;trains &s;till more and more melodious&mdash;'Hea|vens!' &s;aid mr. Delaval, &s;tarting up in the boat, 'it mu&s;t be Mar&s;ini, and he has at la&s;t remembered his promi&s;e, made &s;o many years ago. Ha&s;ten, rowers, to the &s;hore. The &s;ound &s;eems to come from near yon creek.'</P>
<P>Mrs. Percival fetched a deep &s;igh. The &s;ounds were accounted for: and her hopes, if &s;uch a chaos of ideas as filled her bo&s;om might be called hopes, were cru&s;hed again. As they drew near the &s;hore, the mu&s;ic cea&s;ing, mr. Delaval called 'Mar&s;ini! count Mar&s;ini!' No an&s;wer was made, but the hautboy began again, and they &s;oon di&s;covered the mu&s;ician, &s;eated on a rock, ju&s;t above the creek, to which they were rowing.</P>
<P>Mr. Delaval again called 'Mar&s;ini!'&mdash;&s;till no an|&s;wer was made but by the mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>'Heavens!' cried mrs. Percival, 'He an&s;wers not to you!&mdash;It is&mdash;it mu&s;t be!&mdash;' &s;he &s;topped. She thought &s;he had been indi&s;creet; but fortunately the attention of the company was too much engaged with the mu&s;ic, to attend to what &s;he &s;aid; and it was unnoticed, except by her own family. The boat, at length, reached the &s;hore, and mr. Delaval was ha&s;|tening to the mu&s;ician, who &s;liding down the rock, met him half way, and in a moment the names of 'count Mar&s;ini,' and '&s;ignior Delaval,' were ex|changed; for he was indeed the count Mar&s;ini, whom mr. Delaval conjectured him to be.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="038283_0079_10118999F71BC5D8">This count Mar&s;ini was an Italian nobleman, with whom mr. Delaval had been very much acquainted during his re&s;idence at Florence, and from whom he had received very great attention and kindne&s;s in va|rious ways. He did not, however, continue at Flo|rence all the time mr. Delaval was there, which was near three years, for he had been unfortunate in lo&s;ing a very amiable wife, after he had been married to her le&s;s than a year, which circum&s;tance had affected him &s;o much, that it had a vi&s;ible effect on his health; in con&s;equence of which, his friends per&s;uaded him to travel about, in order to turn his thoughts, if po&s;&s;ible, into a different channel. It was on this &s;cheme, that he quitted Florence before mr. Delaval had left it, promi&s;ing, however, at his departure, that when mr. Delaval was returned to Ireland, he would vi&s;it him there. But &s;o many years had elap&s;ed, &s;ince the pro|mi&s;e was made, without its being fulfilled, that mr. Delaval began to be in de&s;pair of ever &s;eeing him.</P>
<P>He had, however, arrived at Airville hou&s;e while mr. Delaval, with his &s;on and daughter, were ab&s;ent on the above-mentioned party, and being informed by the &s;ervants where their ma&s;ter was, and conducted by them to the &s;pot where it was probable the com|pany would land, he &s;at him&s;elf down to &s;urvey the beauty of the &s;cenery, when his attention was taken off from that &s;ubject, by the fine voice of Antoinette, and a thought in&s;tantly occured to him to announce his arrival by the re&s;pon&s;ive &s;trains of his hautboy, which he did not doubt mr. Delaval would &s;oon re|cognize.</P>
<P>The&s;e things being explained, mr. Delaval intro|duced him to the company and he was, by mrs. Per|cival, invited to &s;up with the re&s;t of the party at Ar|lington ca&s;tle; to which place they all immediately proceeded.</P>
<P>It was on their arrival there, that Mar&s;ini fir&s;t had a full view of the countenance of Antoinette, on which he no &s;ooner ca&s;t his eyes, than he &s;tarted, and was

&s;carcely able to take them from her again. Then, as if aware of his rudene&s;s, he turned them away; but during the whole evening, they were perpetually wandering towards her, and it &s;eemed to require the exertion of all his &s;elf-command, to keep them one moment from her.</P>
<P>Nor did this admiration cea&s;e with the fir&s;t inter|view: but it &s;eemed to increa&s;e every time he &s;aw her, which, on account of the intimacy &s;ub&s;i&s;ting be|tween the two families, he did very often.</P>
<P>Mar&s;ini was now in the fortieth year of his age, nineteen of which he had been a widower, and, per|haps, no man ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed greater attractions. His countenance, and per&s;on, were &s;uch as to prejudice every one &s;trongly in his favour; for the former had in it an irre&s;i&s;tible benevolence, and animation, and the latter was genteel and well formed. He had been, as we have already hinted, a great traveller: and from the knowledge he had thus acquired of men and manners, was a mo&s;t entertaining and in&s;tructive companion, and had the true Italian ta&s;te for mu&s;ic and painting, in both which arts he was a great adept.</P>
<P>The&s;e talents recommended him extremely to mrs. Percival and Antoinette, who were both pa&s;&s;ionate ad|mirers of excellence in any way, and both great profi|cients in the arts, in which Mar&s;ini particularly excelled. But Antoinette was always the chief object of his at|tention, nor did he ever appear &s;o happy as when in|&s;tructing her. Was mu&s;ic her employment? Mar&s;ini was &s;till by her &s;ide at the piano-forte, improving her &s;tile and execution, both in &s;inging and playing. Did nature's charms woo her all-excelling pencil? Mar&s;ini was always at hand to point out the mo&s;t beautiful &s;pot among&s;t the romantic &s;cenery around them, as an object for its exerci&s;e. Was her attention engaged by the &s;ublimity of Ta&s;&s;o? by the &s;weetly melting lays of love-lorn Petrarch? or by the be|witching harmony of the elegant Meta&s;ta&s;io? Mar&s;ini in&s;tructed her in cadence and articulation. Mar&s;ini

gave grace, feeling, and expre&s;&s;ion to all. Still it was &s;ilent admiration only which he be&s;towed on her. She never was the topic of his conver&s;ation, any far|ther than as the family at Arlington were often made the &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e among&s;t mr. Delaval's family, when Mar&s;ini would, in general terms, &s;peak in ad|miration of them: and though every one &s;aw that he was deeply &s;truck with the lovely Antoinette, they &s;aw it only; they never heard it.</P>
<P>Francis Delaval &s;aw, and not without regret, how deep an impre&s;&s;ion &s;he had made on the count; not, that he &s;eemed to have made the like impre&s;&s;ion on her; but Francis, who had him&s;elf too &s;u&s;ceptible a heart to have &s;een Antoinette with indifference, dreaded le&s;t the perfections of the count &s;hould over|balance with his mi&s;tre&s;s the di&s;proportion of their years, and at la&s;t make a conque&s;t of that heart, which he wi&s;hed to retain for him&s;elf. He felt, at the &s;ame time, &s;o &s;trongly, that the count was &s;o every way de|&s;erving of her, that he could hardly regret it, &s;hould &s;he be&s;tow her&s;elf on him.</P>
<P>However, he was determined not to yield up this prize to a rival without any re&s;i&s;tance; and he was, therefore, not at all behind hand with the count in his a&s;&s;iduities. As he was well acquainted with the country, which he had explored very much &s;ince his re&s;idence in it, he contrived parties for a day's excur|&s;ion, to any &s;pot which he thought worth viewing; and in the&s;e he had &s;ometimes the inexpre&s;&s;ible plea|&s;ure of having Antoinette's company with him in his chai&s;e. At other times, he made parties to dance on the lawn, either at Airville or Arlington, when he &s;hared, at lea&s;t, with Mar&s;ini, the hand of Antoinette. Various other amu&s;ements, too, he contrived, in hopes of recommending him&s;elf to the object of his affections; who, on her part, received his attentions, as well as tho&s;e of Mar&s;ini, with an ea&s;y politene&s;s, but without the lea&s;t appearance of preference, or partiality to either.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="038283_0082_101189A0C6610A98">Francis, one day, in one of the excur&s;ions we have mentioned, conducted the company to a very curious cell, in a rock, which hung over the &s;ea, and which was called Alfred's cave, and to which, he &s;aid, a very affecting &s;tory was attached, as he had lately di&s;co|vered in looking over a volume of poems, called the Mu&s;e of Killarney; which &s;tory he would, if agree|able, read to them, when they were all &s;eated in the cell.

In the interior was a re|ce&s;s, which &s;eemed de&s;igned as a chapel, where an urn was erected, on the pede&s;tal of which was an in|&s;cription, the characters of which were &s;o much de|faced by time, that it was perfectly illegible: but it was &s;uppo&s;ed to be a tribute to the memory of poor Helen.</P>
<P>After they had &s;ufficiently examined the monu|ments of indu&s;try and &s;orrow, which this cave pre|&s;ented, the company returned to Airville, where they were to pa&s;s the evening. There Mar&s;ini found a letter from Italy, which having read, he &s;aid, addre&s;&s;|ing mr. Delaval,</P>
<P>'What think you, &s;ignor, of our friend the mar|quis Vellorno being married to a young woman only &s;ixteen years of age?'</P>
<P>'Is it po&s;&s;ible?' an&s;wered mr. Delaval,</P>
<P>'Why, Vellorno him&s;elf cannot &s;urely be le&s;s than fifty?'</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="038283_0092_101195EC6C3830C0">'You are quite right,' &s;aid Mar&s;ini, 'Vellorno is now in his fifty-fir&s;t year.'</P>
<P>'Be&s;ides,' &s;aid mr. Delaval, 'it was always &s;uppo&s;ed that he was waiting for the death of count Durazzo, to marry his widow.'</P>
<P>'Tis true,' &s;aid Mar&s;ini, 'that &s;uch was the general idea, but it now appears that it was an un|founded one.&mdash;But you &s;hall hear what his cou|&s;in, count Carletti, writes to me.' Mar&s;ini then read as follows:</P>
<P>'How much will you be &s;urpri&s;ed, my dear Gia|como, to hear that our friend, and my cou&s;in, the marquis Vellorno, has given his hand in marriage, not to the hand&s;ome widow of Durazzo, whom, dur|ing her hu&s;band's life, he had &s;o long &s;erved in qua|lity of cice&s;beo, and whom every one &s;uppo&s;ed, at the death of her hu&s;band, he would have advanced to the rank of marchione&s;s Vellorno; but to count de Portici's daughter, who is only thirty-four years younger than him&s;elf! This match is now the uni|ver&s;al topic of conver&s;ation and &s;peculation, and it is &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome people&punc; that there are private rea|&s;ons for it, of a political nature, and that the poor bride's inclinations have been little con&s;ulted on this occa&s;ion. Others, however, are of opinion, that the young marchione&s;s has, at lea&s;t her &s;hare in the am|bition of the hou&s;e of Portici, and that &s;he would have married a man, even twenty years older than Vellorno, for the &s;ake of the rank, to which &s;he is rai&s;ed; while another de&s;cription of people &s;trenu|ou&s;ly a&s;&s;ert, that it is entirely a match of affection on both &s;ides.'</P>
<P>'Affection?' exclaimed Francis Delaval, 'Impo&s;|&s;ible! How can the bloom of &s;ixteen be united, through affection, to the frozen bo&s;om of fifty?&mdash; No, no: attachment cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t between people of &s;uch di&s;proportionate years. Oh! how I pity the lady, if &s;he has been made a &s;acrifice to political <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iews! but I could almo&s;t find in my heart to cur&s;e
<PB N="94" REF="038283_0093_101195EF4DF9BE58">
her, if through ambition &s;he could form &s;o unnatural an union.'</P>
<P>'Why, I own, indeed,' &s;aid Mar&s;ini, 'that there does &s;eem rather too great a di&s;proportion of years in this in&s;tance, e&s;pecially con&s;idering the extreme youth of the marchione&s;s. But I have heard many ladies of twenty, or even under twenty, declare, that they thought the manners of a man of forty, or near it, commonly much more intere&s;ting and attractive, than tho&s;e of men nearer to their own age. I mu&s;t beg pardon for having ju&s;t fixed on my own age as the mo&s;t plea&s;ing; but you will allow, that one cannot help feeling a little vanity in the hopes of catching the attention of the young and beautiful among&s;t the other &s;ex.'</P>
<P>'Francis during this &s;peech, had particularly watched Mar&s;ini's eyes, but did not find them &s;tray once towards Antoinette. He an&s;wered; 'No apo|logy is nece&s;&s;ary on this occa&s;ion, my dear count, and I will freely own, that if all men of forty were like you, I &s;hould not at all wonder at the preference you &s;eem to think the ladies in general give to men of that age.'</P>
<P>Mar&s;ini interrupted him: 'I meant not, my dear &s;ir, to a&s;k for &s;uch a compliment, of which I feel my|&s;elf unde&s;erving. I only meant to ob&s;erve, that, in general, I think the &s;uperior knowledge of the world, which accompanies &s;uperior years, is more plea&s;ing to the female mind than the mere gaieties of youth, however enchanting they may be at times.'</P>
<P>'Neither did I mean to pay a compliment,' re|turned Francis. 'I &s;poke what I really thought: and I perfectly agree in the opinion, that where a man of &s;orty has made a proper u&s;e of his advance in years, he mu&s;t be far more captivating than a very young man. But it mu&s;t altogether depend on the u&s;e that he has made of his &s;uperiority of years, whether or not he &s;hall be this formidable rival of youth: for if he has not u&s;ed it in the acqui&s;ition of knowledge&punc;
<PB N="95" REF="038283_0094_101195F35A4985D0">
and improvement of his mind, the empty rattle which is &s;carcely to be endured, even in youth, is ab&s;olutely in&s;upportable in more advanced years.'</P>
<P>'Mo&s;t certainly,' an&s;wered Mar&s;ini, 'no general rule can, in this in&s;tance, be laid down. The only thing that can be &s;aid, is, that, where the di&s;po&s;ition for improvement is the &s;ame, the man of forty mu&s;t have this advantage over the man of twenty; that his years have given him greater opportunity of acquiring tho&s;e &s;ources of entertainment, which mu&s;t recom|mend him very much to every &s;en&s;ible woman.'</P>
<P>''Tis true,' &s;aid Francis; 'and here we meet pretty much on the &s;ame point, that, where the &s;pirit of improvement is wanting, the man of forty has no ad|vantage over his juniors, but a manife&s;t di&s;advantage, in that he has lo&s;t the agreeablene&s;s of youth, to which, after all, a certain charm is attached, without having attained any of the advantages of years. But, I beg your pardon, &s;ir, I fear I have engaged rather arrogantly in this argument.</P>
<P>'Oh! by no means.' returned Mar&s;ini. 'I rejoice to hear you inclined to enter into &s;uch kind of di&s;cu&s;|&s;ions, which few young men ever will engage in; and I am per&s;uaded they are a great &s;ource of in|&s;truction, as well as of entertainment to both parties.'</P>
<P>'I rejoice to hear you &s;ay &s;o, &s;ignor,' replied Fran|cis; 'for I think one great cau&s;e of the general &s;tu|pidity of all parties, is, that people bani&s;h from them all topics of &s;peculative di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and confine them|&s;elves to talking over pa&s;&s;ing occurrences, which I think the mo&s;t tire&s;ome of all conver&s;ation.'</P>
<P>'Ah!' &s;aid Mar&s;ini, 'How much do your &s;enti|ments recal to my recollection a young man, whom,' &s;aid he, addre&s;&s;ing mr. Delaval, 'you remember, &s;ir, no doubt, as he was with me, I think, for &s;ome time after you came to Florence, the chevalier de St. Foix &mdash;he was pa&s;&s;ionately fond of an argument of this kind, and a mo&s;t extraordinary talent he had for it. I have known that young man, at the age of only

twenty, completely baffle many of our &s;ages, both in churcn and &s;tate, by the &s;oundne&s;s of his rea&s;onings, and the depth of his ob&s;ervations. But perhaps, you will think, that le&s;s &s;plendid talents than his, might have &s;ufficed to beat them off from ground &s;o untenable, as the doctrines of our church, and the principles of our government. However, he was a rare gem.'</P>
<P>'So he truly was,' &s;aid mr. Delaval 'I &s;carce ever &s;aw &s;uch brilliant talents; but he came, I think, to an untimely end.'</P>
<P>'Alas! he did indeed,' an&s;wered Mar&s;ini 'he quitted me to go to his &s;i&s;ter, who was, at that time, &s;uffering a cruel per&s;ecution from her father, on ac|count of a marriage he had agreed on for her, to which &s;he would not con&s;ent; and the poor chevalier was killed in a duel with this lover, after which, I was told the &s;i&s;ter was &s;hut up in a convent by her father, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, as I well know, were of a mo&s;t un|governable kind.'</P>
<P>Mar&s;ini &s;eemed much agitated; he fixed his eyes for a few moments upon Antoinette, who &s;at directly oppo&s;ite to him, but withdrew them rather in a hurried manner, and re&s;uming the di&s;cour&s;e, &s;aid,</P>
<P>'But we are wandering wide of our original que&s;|tion, which was, Whether it could be &s;uppo&s;ed po&s;&s;i|ble for a young woman of &s;ixteen, to marry a man of fifty, from attachment only. What is your opinion, mrs. Percival?'</P>
<P>'I think it not only po&s;&s;ible,' &s;aid mrs. Percival, 'but even very probable, that &s;he may do &s;o; and I am inclined to be of opinion, that a woman has a bet|ter pro&s;pect of happine&s;s with a man &s;ome years older than her&s;elf, than with a very young man, who though he may be very much attached to her at the time &s;he marries him, yet from a &s;icklene&s;s of temper, often attendant on youth, may po&s;&s;ibly abate in that attachment in a few years, and his heart may wander
<PB N="97" REF="038283_0096_101195FA902F1CB8">
after other objects.&mdash;But, why do I &s;ay this? For at this moment I could cite many in&s;tances of happy, and many of unhappy, matches, both where there was a great di&s;proportion of years, and where there was nearly an equality in that re&s;pect. Indeed, with one of the happie&s;t couples I know, the di&s;proportion of years is on the other &s;ide from what we have hitherto been di&s;cu&s;&s;ing: for the lady was thirty-two years old when &s;he married, and the gentleman only twenty-four. Yet their regard for each other has appeared continually increa&s;ing during twenty years, which they have now lived together.'</P>
<P>'Well, then,' &s;aid Mar&s;ini, 'on the whole we may conclude, that it mu&s;t depend on other circum|&s;tances, rather than on the relative ages of the parties concerned, whether a marriage &s;hall turn out an happy one or not.'</P>
<P>'Mo&s;t certainly,' &s;aid mrs. Percival, 'if they are but &s;trongly attached to each other, the ages are of &s;mall importance: but no happine&s;s can be expected on any other foundation than that of mutual attach|ment; and for this rea&s;on I am inclined to think, that tho&s;e mariages are mo&s;t likely to be happy, which are the re&s;ult of long habits of intimacy with each other, and where the foundation for love is laid in friend&s;hip; for in fact, conjugal attachment is the mo&s;t refined &s;pecies of friend&s;hip.'</P>
<P>'You now &s;urpri&s;e me much,' &s;aid mr. Delaval; 'for I have always inclined to the opinion, that a very long previous engagement was rather inimical to matrimonial happine&s;s.'</P>
<P>'Mi&s;take me not, &s;ir,' an&s;wered mrs. Percival. 'I do not mean by long habits of intimacy, a long engagement. I perfectly agree with you in opinion, that a long engagement has often proved a gulph, which has &s;wallowed up all conjugal happine&s;s. I only mean to &s;ay, that I think tho&s;e have the be&s;t pro&s;pect of happine&s;s in marriage, who have been long acquainted with each other before any engagement takes place.
<PB N="98" REF="038283_0097_101195FE81DA1348">
But when an ab&s;olute engagement is entered into, it cannot be too &s;oon fulfilled.'</P>
<P>'But I am afraid,' &s;aid mr Delaval, 'that it is not often, that people can come together on tho&s;e terms.'</P>
<P>'Perhaps &s;o,' replied mrs. Percival. 'But happy are tho&s;e to who&s;e lot &s;uch a connexion falls. Long accu&s;tomed to place their happine&s;s in each other's &s;o|ciety&mdash;to &s;hare the &s;ame amu&s;ements, and the &s;ame occupations&mdash;to &s;ee, and make allowances for each other's failings; and to know how to prize each other's good qualities: I can conceive no happine&s;s equal to marrying under &s;uch circum&s;tances. But where one &s;ide is indifferent to the other, 'tis madne&s;s to &s;up|po&s;e any happine&s;s can ever exi&s;t; and 'tis the mo&s;t dangerous of all &s;elf-deceptions, to expect it.'</P>
<P>She had gone too far in this la&s;t &s;peech. It brought home to her mind, rather too forcibly, her own &s;i|tuation. She began to he&s;itate, and to falter in her voice.</P>
<P>Mar&s;ini &s;aw &s;he was agitated. He knew enough of her &s;tory from the Delaval family, to gue&s;s the cau&s;e of it; and willing to divert the &s;ubject from the cour&s;e which it had taken, addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf thus to Caroline and Antoinette:</P>
<P>'And, what do you think, &s;ignore?' he &s;aid, 'You have not yet given your opinion on this &s;ubject, and perhaps you are the be&s;t judges in this ca&s;e, as you are about the very age we are &s;peaking of. Do you really think you could marry a man of fifty years old, from motives of attachment only?&mdash;though perhaps, it is hardly a fair que&s;tion.'</P>
<P>Caroline replied without he&s;itation, that he had, perhaps, gone too far in mentioning fifty; but &s;he thought it very po&s;&s;ible for a young woman to marry a man of twenty years older than her&s;elf, from no other motive but that of &s;trong affection.'</P>
<P>'So far,' &s;aid Mar&s;ini, 'the an&s;wer is favourable for my &s;ide of the que&s;tion. But now, mi&s;s Perci|val,
<PB N="99" REF="038283_0098_101196000DC690C8">
what do you &s;ay? May we not hope to have your &s;entiments?'</P>
<P>'Indeed,' &s;aid Antoinette, 'You put a que&s;tion to me, &s;ignor, to which I hardly know how to give an an&s;wer.&mdash;A &s;en&s;ible man of forty or fifty may be, nay, certainly is, a mo&s;t de&s;irable companion and friend for a young woman; perhaps, there hardly can be a more advantageous circum&s;tance to her, than to have &s;uch a friend. Yet I own, for a hu&s;band, it &s;eems to me a great di&s;proportion of years; and I &s;hould think it more de&s;irable for a man and woman to be united in that happie&s;t of all &s;tates, with a pro&s;|pect of neither of them much out-living the other. For my own part, nothing could weigh in my mind again&s;t the dreadful idea, that my hu&s;band might die twenty years before me.'</P>
<P>During this &s;peech, her eyes had wandered invo|luntarily towards Francis Delaval; but &s;he &s;oon re|collected her&s;elf, and turned them again to the per|&s;on &s;he was addre&s;&s;ing. Francis's eyes &s;parkled with delight, whil&s;t Mar&s;ini appeared &s;omewhat chagrined, but Henry Percival &s;oon drew the whole attention of the company, by exclaiming,</P>
<P>'Well, I am glad to hear that my &s;i&s;ter is of that opinion, for I began to be quite alarmed, le&s;t if the young women were all for taking the old men, we young men &s;hould be reduced to take the old women; and I hone&s;tly confe&s;s, that I &s;hould not wi&s;h for a wife thirty years older than my&s;elf.'</P>
<P>This hone&s;t declaration of Henry's rai&s;ed a general laugh, and &s;o put an end to the conver&s;ation.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>BUT, though Mar&s;ini had heard this declaration of the &s;entiments of Antoinette, which certainly was no encouragement to him to continue his pur&s;uit of her; he did not in the lea&s;t remit his a&s;&s;iduities: but, as &s;he began to perceive their tendency, although at fir&s;t &s;he had received, and encouraged them only as tho&s;e of a friend, &s;he found it nece&s;&s;ary to alter her conduct, and &s;he began, therefore, rather to &s;hun him. When he invited her to the piano-forte, &s;he was not inclined to play, but had &s;omething to write, or made &s;ome other excu&s;e. Did he a&s;k her to accompany him to take &s;ome view?&mdash;She had already &s;o many unfini&s;hed &s;ketches, that &s;he did not choo&s;e to begin any more 'till &s;ome of them were compleated. Did he invite her to read Italian with him?&mdash; She had read &s;o much lately, that &s;he wi&s;hed for a re&s;pite; and by the&s;e means &s;he eluded being alone with him; which, be|fore that time, &s;he had never &s;crupled to be.</P>
<P>Mar&s;ini &s;aw and felt mortified at her coolne&s;s. He wi&s;hed for an opportunity of &s;peaking with her in private; but it was plain, that &s;he cautiou&s;ly avoided affording him the opportunity he wi&s;hed. She &s;el|dom walked out by her&s;elf&mdash;employed her&s;elf in her own apartment, that &s;he might avoid &s;eeing the count, who &s;carcely ever pa&s;&s;ed a day, without calling at the hou&s;e; and &s;he even made excu&s;es to &s;tay at home when the re&s;t of the family went to Airville. But, though this behaviour on her part, was &s;ufficiently
<PB N="101" REF="038283_0100_101196A43393BC40">
di&s;couraging to his hopes, Mar&s;ini was drawn to her by &s;uch an irre&s;i&s;tible attraction, that he determined, at all hazards, to have &s;ome private conver&s;ation with her.</P>
<P>One day, therefore, when mrs. Percival and her family were to attend a concert at Airville, the count watched, in his apartment, for their arrival; and, &s;eeing that Antoinette was not with them, he immediately took his hor&s;e, and rode to Arlington. Antoinette, un&s;u&s;picious that he would take this method of &s;eeing her, had taken no precautions to prevent his gaining acce&s;s to her; and he was, therefore, without he&s;i|tation, &s;hewn into the parlour where &s;he was &s;itting, practi&s;ing a new &s;ong, which had been ju&s;t &s;ent her from London.</P>
<P>She was &s;o intent upon her employment, and &s;o un|&s;u&s;picious of interruption, that &s;he did not perceive Mar&s;ini's entrance, 'till he came clo&s;e to her, and &s;aid,</P>
<P>'I hope my Antoinette has not now a letter to write, but will &s;tay and hear what I have &s;o long wi&s;hed to &s;ay to her.'</P>
<P>'I am a&s;toni&s;hed, count Mar&s;ini,' &s;he &s;aid, 'at this intru&s;ion. It is what I could not expect from you, whom I have always con&s;idered as a true gentle|man.'</P>
<P>'I own, madam,' &s;aid Mar&s;ini, 'that my conduct is hardly to be ju&s;tified; but believe me, I have not thru&s;t my&s;elf thus into your pre&s;ence, with any inten|tion to per&s;ecute or di&s;tre&s;s you, but merely with a wi&s;h that we may come to a right under&s;tanding of each other. And I faithfully promi&s;e, that if you will for this time give me a pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent hearing, I will never again, if it &s;hall be your de&s;ire, mention the &s;ubject on which it is my de&s;ire now to open my mind to you. I will even quit this country, if you &s;hall wi&s;h it, and never again incommode you with the pre&s;ence of one who is &s;o di&s;agreeable to you. Tell me, then, may I now &s;peak out?'</P>
<P>Antoinette he&s;itated.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="038283_0101_101196A5C8E99DC0">'You pau&s;e, deare&s;t maid,' &s;aid he. 'I will take my leave of you this moment, if you require it.'</P>
<P>'No, no,' &s;he replied; 'You mu&s;t, I think, be a man of honour, nor will &s;ay any thing, which I ought not to hear. Therefore, &s;peak on.'</P>
<P>'Well then,' he &s;aid, 'dear Antoinette, I think you cannot but have perceived, how deep an impre&s;|&s;ion you made on me, even the fir&s;t moment that I &s;aw you.' Tears almo&s;t &s;tarted into his eyes. 'An|toinette, I was married at only twenty years of age, to a woman whom I loved to a degree beyond the power of words to expre&s;s, and which none but tho&s;e, who have loved to an equal degree, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> form an idea of. But fate &s;eparated us in le&s;s than half a year after we were united! Oh! Antoinette, when I fir&s;t &s;aw you, I thought I beheld my poor Gabrielle returned from the tomb, and could &s;carcely refrain from cla&s;p|ing you to my bo&s;om, and welcoming a dear and long lo&s;t friend. My &s;en&s;ations at that moment were in|de&s;cribable. I had, &s;ince the death of my Gabrielle, been quite in&s;en&s;ible to female charms. I now, again, powerfully felt their influence, and had &s;oon no plea&s;ure, when ab&s;ent from your &s;ociety. I wi&s;hed you had been my daughter&mdash;with what double tran&s;|port then, &s;hould I have been your in&s;tructor!&mdash;have cheri&s;hed your virtues, and corrected your failings, though for that you would &s;carcely allow me any op|portunity! With what tran&s;port &s;hould I have beheld your cultivated and enlightened under&s;tanding, daily advancing nearer and nearer to perfection!&mdash;you would have been the &s;olace of my life, which has been a burden to me &s;ince my Gabrielle was taken from me. But my daughter you could not be: yet I knew not how to live without you, and, pardon my pre&s;umption, I therefore wi&s;hed to make you my wife.</P>
<P>'Here, then, deare&s;t Antoinette, I offer you my hand and heart. The latter is entirely devoted to you; and I make this offer, for the fir&s;t and the la&s;t time. I believe you far above the common female

I know you have &s;een my love for you, for I could not conceal it. This offer can &s;carcely, therefore, be unexpected; and you mu&s;t, already, have well weighed in your mind, what an&s;wer you &s;hould give to it. Tell me then, my lovely girl, am I to hope, or mu&s;t I make up my mind to bear with di&s;appointment?&mdash;It will be a hard ta&s;k, believe me; but, at lea&s;t, if I mu&s;t not be your hu&s;band<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> let me be your friend.

<P>He pau&s;ed&punc; and taking her hand, &s;eemed to expect her reply. But the pathetic tone and manner in which his la&s;t words were delivered, had di&s;&s;olved the heart of Antoinette &s;o much, that &s;he had bur&s;t into tears, and at fir&s;t could not &s;peak; but when reco|vered, &s;he &s;aid,</P>
<P>'Count Mar&s;ini, you have pleaded your cau&s;e in the mo&s;t eloquent manner that words could have pleaded it; and your open and undi&s;gui&s;ed explana|tion of your &s;entiments has made a much deeper im|pre&s;&s;ion on my &s;oul, than all the artificial harangues commonly u&s;ed on &s;uch occa&s;ions could po&s;&s;ibly have done. Let me be as ingenious as your&s;elf. Believe me, I mo&s;t &s;incerely revere your virtues, and e&s;teem your character. I feel the mo&s;t lively gratitude for the preference with which you have honoured me; and nothing can be more grateful to my bo&s;om, than al|ways to cheri&s;h you there as a friend; but think not of any thing farther.

count Mar&s;ini, it is impo&s;&s;ible, that at pre&s;ent I &s;hould marry at all.&mdash;Heaven only knows to what &s;cenes of &s;orrow a ha&s;ty union on my part might lead.

<P>'Well then,' he &s;aid, 'I am &s;atisfied; but dear|e&s;t Antoinette, let me be your friend, your father! Do not, oh! do not &s;hun me: it kills me to &s;ee your cold and averted looks.

<P>'Indeed, &s;ir,' an&s;wered Antoinette, 'I do not wi&s;h your ab&s;ence; and after the a&s;&s;urances you have made me, I have no fear of giving up my &s;oul to you in the mo&s;t unre&s;erved friend&s;hip.&mdash;Yes, I will again be your pupil, your el&ecirc;ve; I owe much to you al|ready, nor &s;hall you ever find me ungrateful, either for your pa&s;t, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uture kindne&s;s.'</P>

<P>Antoinette looked earne&s;tly at him. She knew not what to make of his words. Her parents were unknown to her. How was it that &s;he bore &s;o &s;trong a re&s;emblance to Mar&s;ini's decea&s;ed wife?&mdash;Her thoughts were confu&s;ed&mdash;&s;he wi&s;hed to a&s;k a thou&s;and que&s;tions, but prudence forbade her to &s;peak&mdash;time might unfold more: but, in the mean time, &s;he &s;tored up carefully in her bo&s;om the things &s;he had heard.</P>
<P>'Well, then,' he &s;aid, 'on the&s;e terms we now &s;e|parate. As a friend I &s;till may love and regard you, but never &s;hall a more a&s;piring thought find a place in my heart.

<P>So &s;aying, he took her hand gently, which he pre&s;&s;ed to his lips, and with a look full of anxious af|fection, withdrew, pondering all the way home, on what &s;he had &s;aid, earne&s;tly wi&s;hing to unravel the my&s;terious meaning of her words; yet unable to form any conjecture which might lead to a probable &s;olu|tion of them.</P>
<P>When mrs. Percival returned home, Antoinette re|lated to her all that had pa&s;&s;ed, and received from her the warme&s;t approbation of her conduct, and thus matters re&s;ted for a &s;hort time. Mar&s;ini re&s;umed his
<PB N="106" REF="038283_0105_101196B0DF039728">
character of in&s;tructor to Antoinette, and &s;he no longer &s;hunned his attentions; all which Francis Delaval, who did not know what had pa&s;&s;ed, regarded with a jealous and envious eye.</P>
<P>Francis, however, was &s;oon in &s;ome &s;ort relieved from his anxiety, by finding, that though he had no pro&s;pect him&s;elf of &s;ucceeding in his wi&s;hes, yet that the count's pro&s;pect was no better; and &s;ome con&s;o|lation is always to be derived from the knowledge, that a rival has no chance of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the trea&s;ure which we our&s;elves have in vain endeavoured to obtain.</P>
<P>Francis had long cultivated an intimacy with Henry Percival, perhaps, at fir&s;t, in the hope, that an inti|macy with the brother might a&s;&s;i&s;t his views with re|gard to the &s;i&s;ter; but it was afterwards continued out of regard to the youth him&s;elf, who certainly was highly de&s;erving his friend&s;hip. Francis, therefore, re&s;olved to &s;ound Henry on the &s;ubject of his &s;i&s;ter's inclinations, and try if he could learn, by that means, whether he might entertain a rea&s;onable hope of her lending a favourable ear to his addre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>One day, therefore, when they were walking out together, Francis, as if quite unde&s;ignedly, drew the conver&s;ation round to Antoinette, and after it had been carried to &s;ome length, at la&s;t a&s;ked Henry, 'if his &s;i&s;ter was not going to be married to count Mar|&s;ini, for he &s;aid it was generally &s;uppo&s;ed that the match was agreed on: and,' &s;aid he, 'although &s;trange to &s;ay, Mar&s;ini, though our gue&s;t, has never hinted a word to us on the &s;ubject; yet I can neverthele&s;s &s;carcely doubt of the truth of the report, as he and mi&s;s Percival &s;o much are together.'</P>
<P>Henry replied, 'That he believed the count would be very glad to marry his &s;i&s;ter: but, indeed,' &s;aid he, 'I think he is too old for her, and I know very well that my &s;i&s;ter is determined not to marry at pre&s;ent, whoever might offer to her; &s;he &s;ays &s;he is too young yet to undertake the care of a family; be&s;ides&mdash;'</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="038283_0106_101196B2777CE138">He &s;topped: he thought he had &s;aid a word too much.</P>
<P>'Be&s;ides what?' a&s;ked Francis eagerly.</P>
<P>'O nothing,' &s;aid Henry. 'But I am &s;ure my &s;i&s;ter would not marry now; and perhaps &s;he may never marry at all.'</P>
<P>'You a&s;toni&s;h me,' &s;aid Francis. 'How can &s;uch a charming young woman have made &s;o &s;trange, &s;o cruel a re&s;olution?'</P>
<P>'Why, &s;he has not made it without good rea&s;ons,' an&s;wered Henry. 'But come, Frank, don't be &s;o over curious. You have, &s;ome how or other, made me &s;ay too much already.'</P>
<P>Francis &s;aid no more: but Henry's words &s;unk deeply into his mind. There was an air of my&s;tery in them, which a&s;toni&s;hed him exceedingly; but as he found that Henry did not like to be que&s;tioned, he was too much of a gentleman to importune him on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Soon after, in the cour&s;e of their walk, pa&s;&s;ing by the cell which the hermit had inhabited, Francis &s;ud|denly exclaimed,</P>
<P>'Ha! I wonder whether the hermit be &s;till alive? &mdash;I have not &s;een, or heard of him, for a long time, and had almo&s;t forgotten him.' Then, addre&s;&s;ing Henry, 'Did you ever hear of him?' &s;aid he.</P>
<P>'Oh! yes,' an&s;wered Henry, 'and I can tell you that he died very &s;oon after we came to the ca&s;tle: &mdash;What an extraordinary old man he was!'</P>
<P>'Extraordinary indeed,' &s;aid Francis. 'I often tried to get into conver&s;ation with him; but I never could get him to &s;ay much: &s;ometimes I could hardly even obtain an an&s;wer to any que&s;tion I a&s;ked. But once he a&s;ked me, with great anxiety, if I was related to lord Arlington? and on my an&s;wering in the ne|gative, he &s;hook his head, and did not &s;ay any thing more.&mdash;Could you ever get him to talk?'</P>
<P>'I never had an opportunity of trying,' an&s;wered Henry. 'I never &s;aw him 'till after he was dead.'</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="038283_0107_101196B6595A47B8">'Ha!' &s;aid Francis, 'What, did he drop down as he was walking about?&mdash;And did you find him?'</P>
<P>'Oh! no,' &s;aid Henry, 'He died in his cell: and I went there on purpo&s;e to &s;ee him.'</P>
<P>'And how happened that?'</P>
<P>'Why I went becau&s;e I had heard &s;uch a &s;trange account of him from my &s;i&s;ter, and becau&s;e &s;he had &s;ome conver&s;ation with him, that excited our curio&s;ity about him very much.'</P>
<P>'What then, he would talk to your &s;i&s;ter?&mdash;Old as he was, he could not re&s;i&s;t her attractions?'</P>
<P>'Pho,' an&s;wered Henry, 'No, no,&mdash;attractions&mdash; pho&mdash;no&mdash;but my &s;i&s;ter had &s;een him fall, and helped him up, and &s;o he began talking to her. But come, Frank, let us find &s;ome other &s;ubject of conver&s;ation; for though I love my &s;i&s;ter&mdash;dearly love her, yet I don't like to be always talking of her.'</P>
<P>Francis &s;aw more and more plainly, that there was a &s;omething relative to Antoinette, which Henry did not like &s;hould be too clo&s;ely inve&s;tigated. He was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed about it; but at the &s;ame time, felt a &s;ecret plea&s;ure, in finding that he &s;hould not have the mor|tification of &s;eeing her in the arms of a rival.</P>
<P>They &s;oon after arrived in the grounds belonging to the ca&s;tle, where meeting with mrs. Percival and An|toinette, the conver&s;ation &s;oon became general.</P>

<P>IT was not many days after the two conver&s;ations had pa&s;&s;ed, which are related in the preceding chap|ter, that an event occurred, which, while it confirmed Francis in the belief, that &s;ome my&s;tery hung over the fate of Antoinette, at the &s;ame time &s;eemed, in &s;ort, to unravel it: I &s;ay &s;eemed, for though there was a &s;pecious appearance of developement as to her birth, enough of cloud &s;till remained, to leave her mind far from &s;atisfied of the truth of what was ap|prehended to be di&s;covered, and far from thinking it right to crown, at that time, the wi&s;hes of her lover, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ever her inclinations might have prompted her to it.</P>
<P>One day when the two families were met together at Arlington ca&s;tle, a conver&s;ation aro&s;e which occa|&s;ioned the company to wi&s;h to refer to the Romi&s;h Mi&s;&s;al in order to a&s;certain a point on which they were doubtful, and which, Mar&s;ini &s;aid, could immediately be decided by a reference to that book, if one could be produced. Antoinette recollecting that which had belonged to the hermit, and which had been in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion ever &s;ince his death, immediately brought it, and gave it into the hands of Mar&s;ini.</P>
<P>He no &s;ooner ca&s;t his eyes on it, than he exclaimed,</P>
<P>'Good God! &s;ignora! How came this book into your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion?&mdash;The&s;e are the arms of St. Foix!' pointing to the arms in gilding, on the out&s;ide of the book.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="038283_0109_101196BBAA7AA240">Antoinette replied, 'That he mu&s;t excu&s;e her an|&s;wering that que&s;tion; that a hi&s;tory belonged to that book, which &s;he did not care to relate; and perhaps,' &s;he added, 'I have done wrong in producing it, and expo&s;ing my&s;elf to any que&s;tions that might be a&s;ked concerning it.'</P>
<P>'Nay; but for heaven's &s;ake, dear Antoinette, tell me all you know about this book;' &s;aid Mar&s;ini, 'The&s;e are indeed, the arms of St. Foix!&mdash;too, too well do I know them; I cannot be mi&s;taken.&mdash;Look at them mr. Delaval&punc; you know the chevalier:&mdash;You mu&s;t have &s;een the arms frequently.'</P>
<P>Mr. Delaval looked at the book; 'Mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly the&s;e are the arms of St. Foix,' he &s;aid, 'They are too remarkable to be mi&s;taken; and, pardon me, mi&s;s Percival, but I have always thought, that there was a great re&s;emblance between you and our truly amiable friend, the chevalier de St. Foix.'</P>
<P>'Oh! and has the likene&s;s &s;truck you, then?' &s;aid Mar&s;ini, 'Oh! &s;he is the perfect re&s;emblance of my wife, my Gabrielle de St. Foix, and &s;he was the exact counterpart of her brother.'</P>
<P>He got up from his &s;eat; he walked about the room for &s;ome minutes in a violent agitation; then &s;at down by Antoinette, and eagerly gra&s;ping her hand, 'Pardon me, pardon me, deare&s;t creature,' he &s;aid, 'I am on the rack! Oh! relea&s;e me, and &s;ay how that book came into your hands!'</P>
<P>Antoinette looked anxiou&s;ly at mrs. Percival, as if to a&s;k her advice what &s;he &s;hould do, which mrs. Per|cival ob&s;erving, &s;aid,</P>
<P>'You &s;eem to wi&s;h for my opinion, my love, and I will freely give it. We are &s;urely among&s;t people who will not betray what pa&s;&s;es here, and, perhaps, the imparting to the count what you know concerning this book, may lead to important di&s;coveries. But, my Antoinette&mdash;the picture and the cro&s;s: You have them about you, no doubt&mdash;Might you not &s;hew them al&s;o to the count?'</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="038283_0110_101196C28B1BF6B0">Antoinette immediately drew from her pocket a little ca&s;e, in which &s;he always kept them, and open|ing it, pre&s;ented the picture to the count, who ex|claimed,</P>
<P>'My wife!&mdash;my wife!' and fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the floor.</P>
<P>The company looked all a&s;toni&s;hment; they imme|diately applied them&s;elves to a&s;&s;i&s;t the count, but it was &s;ome time before his &s;en&s;es returned; when they did, he exclaimed,</P>
<P>'Merciful God!&mdash;And could then, what I have hitherto con&s;idered as a vile calumny, be really true! &mdash;Yes,' &s;aid he, looking fir&s;t at the picture, and then at Antoinette,&mdash;'It mu&s;t be &s;o&mdash;I cannot doubt any longer;&mdash;But Antoinette, deare&s;t Antoinette, tell me, whence had you the&s;e things?</P>
<P>It was impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;i&s;t the agitation of the count any longer: and Antoinette begged of mrs. Percival to relate her &s;tory, which &s;he immediately did; and, at the conclu&s;ion of it, &s;he de&s;ired Antoinette to &s;hew the cro&s;s to Mar&s;ini, which he had not yet &s;een.</P>
<P>A&s;toni&s;hment at the &s;tory he had heard held the count for &s;ome time in perfect &s;ilence. He looked earne&s;tly at Antoinette for &s;everal minutes, and at length, ca&s;ting his eyes on the cro&s;s, which &s;he held in her hand, he cried out,</P>
<P>'It is St. Foix's! by heaven it is St. Foix's!"</P>
<P>He was again &s;ilent a few minutes; and then &s;aid, 'Come, I will endeavour to compo&s;e my&s;elf, that I may tell my &s;tory; and I think, deare&s;t maid,' addre&s;&s;|ing Antoinette, 'that I can point out to you one of your parents at lea&s;t.'</P>
<P>He went out of the room. He walked a little while about the garden; then returning, and &s;eating him&s;elf by Antoinette, he began thus:</P>
<P>'I have already told you, my deare&s;t creature, that I was married when only twenty years of age. My wife was the elde&s;t daughter of the baron de St. Foix, a French nobleman, who have taken an unaccounta|ble
<PB N="112" REF="038283_0111_101196C419879178">
and unrea&s;onable di&s;like to her, &s;ent her to live with a relation of his at Milan, where I become ac|quainted with her, and was irre&s;i&s;tibly charmed with her. Good God! that a father could find any thing to di&s;&s;ike in &s;o amiable a creature;&mdash;&s;he was faultle&s;s! (I, at lea&s;t, thought &s;o) I &s;oon &s;olicited her hand in marriage; and the baron being indifferent as to her fate, &s;aid, in a cavalier kind of way, 'That I was welcome to take her if I wi&s;hed it; but he &s;hould not give her any fortune.' Fortune, however, was not my aim. I wi&s;hed only for Gabrielle, and was &s;oon after married to her. The baron continued to treat both me and my wife with the utmo&s;t contempt, nor would he &s;uffer his younge&s;t daughter to come near us; but the chevalier de St. Foix's &s;on, who was in every re&s;pect a perfect contra&s;t to the baron, came to Milan, to be pre&s;ent at our marriage, and always treated us with the greate&s;t re&s;pect and attention. Indeed, from our fir&s;t meeting, the &s;tricte&s;t friend|&s;hip commenced between us, which ended only with the untimely death of the chevalier,</P>
<P>'We had only been married a fortnight, when I was obliged to leave this dear wife, (whom I loved beyond expre&s;&s;ion) to attend &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s at the court of Naples. I wi&s;hed to have taken my wife with me, and &s;hould certainly have done &s;o, but as it was quite uncertain how long I might be detained, and whether I might not be obliged to take frequent journeys be|tween Naples and Florence, it was judged be&s;t for me, to leave my wife, who&s;e health was rather deli|cate, with my father, at Florence, and go to Naples, accompanied only by the chevalier de St. Foix.</P>
<P>'Ah! How little did I think, when I parted from my beloved Gabrielle, to take this journey, that I was never to &s;ee her more! but &s;o, alas! it happened. I was detained at Naples for more than five months, and judge, if you can, of my &s;ufferings, when the night before I was to &s;et out on my return to Florence, an expre&s;s arrived from my father, informing me of
<PB N="113" REF="038283_0112_101196C701297088">
the &s;udden death of her, in whom my whole happine&s;s was centred. I returned, however, to Florence; but heaven only knows the torments I endured on my arrival there.</P>
<P>'I found my poor father almo&s;t as much affected with the lo&s;s of my Gabrielle, as I was my&s;elf. He &s;poke of her in terms of the highe&s;t e&s;teem and af|fection; but I always found him unwilling to enter on the &s;ubject of her death, which I then thought was owing to his finding it too affecting a &s;ubject; alas! I fear there was another cau&s;e for his thus &s;hunning the conver&s;ation. He did not, indeed, long &s;urvive a &s;cene, which &s;eemed to have occa&s;ioned him &s;uch bitter affliction, for he died in about half a year after.</P>
<P>'St. Foix continued with me for about a year after the death of my wife, when he was called away in the manner I have mentioned &s;ome time ago; &s;oon after which, to my no &s;mall additional regret, he met with his untimely fate.</P>
<P>'But now, my dear Antoinette, to come to that part of my &s;tory, which I &s;uppo&s;e to relate to you.</P>
<P>'Some time after the departure and death of the chevalier, and while you, mr. Delaval, was re&s;ident in Florence, a &s;trange rumour reached my ears, that my Gabrielle died in child-birth, and that the child was conveyed away, in order that the affair might be kept &s;ecret from me; and was then alive; that this circum&s;tance was known to my father, who thought it better that it &s;hould be concealed from me; for as my poor wife had atoned for her fault with her life, it was unnece&s;&s;ary that her memory &s;hould be black|ened.</P>
<P>'This &s;trange report, I at fir&s;t totally di&s;believed, and even di&s;dained to make enquiries into it; but &s;trong circum&s;tances afterwards appearing to lead me to &s;u&s;pect, that it was not ab&s;olutely without founda|tion, I endeavoured, privately, to inve&s;tigate the truth of it, with intention, if I could find out the
<PB N="114" REF="038283_0113_101196CA41126DE8">
the child, with &s;ufficient proof, that it was really my Gabrielle's to adopt it as my own, and educate it ac|cordingly.</P>
<P>'Perhaps, this may appear to many people an odd re&s;olution; but doating on her as I did, while &s;he was alive, and having &s;o long cheri&s;hed her memory in my bo&s;om, as a model of perfection, I could not feel the indignation which it may be thought I ought to have felt at the deception &s;he had practi&s;ed on me. In &s;hort, I had &s;o long been accu&s;tomed to live upon the idea of my Gabrielle, that I &s;hould have been more rejoiced at having a repre&s;entative of her, to love, cheri&s;h, and protect, than chagrined at finding that another had &s;hared tho&s;e beauties with me, which I had been accu&s;tomed to con&s;ider as exclu|&s;ively mine.</P>
<P>'But after the mo&s;t diligent &s;earch, I could not find out the child I fought for, nor could I find either a complete confirmation, or contradiction of the &s;tory I had heard. The circum&s;tance which &s;eemed mo&s;t of all to confirm the truth of the &s;tory, was, that a woman who had attended on Gabrielle, di&s;appeared immediately on her death, taking with her, as was &s;uppo&s;ed, a number of jewels, which were mi&s;&s;ed at the &s;ame time. This, at the time, I attributed en|tirely to the di&s;hone&s;ty of the woman; but I now con|ceive that it might be with a view of providing for the child. After all, the affair was &s;o dark and my&s;terious, that I hardly knew what to think of it, but have al|ways been inclined to believe, that the character of my deare&s;t Gabrielle was fal&s;ely a&s;per&s;ed.</P>
<P>'But now, my Antoinette, I &s;ee in you her per|fect likene&s;s;&mdash;I &s;ee you in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of articles, which I know mu&s;t have belonged to the hou&s;e of St. Foix, from which &s;he was de&s;cended; and cannot, therefore, but &s;uppo&s;e, that there are people who know you to belong to that hou&s;e.

<P>He accompanied the&s;e la&s;t words with ardently pre&s;&s;ing the hand of the trembling Antoinette to his bo&s;om.</P>
<P>She had li&s;tened to the &s;tory with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed emotions of grief and a&s;toni&s;hment; and the whole company, indeed, were deeply affected with his intere&s;ting nar|rative, and, particularly, with the extraordinary be|nevolence he had &s;hewn with regard to his Gabrielle and her chil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P>Mrs. Percival was the fir&s;t to remark on the &s;tory, by que&s;tioning Mar&s;ini, with &s;ome emotion, 'What had occa&s;ioned his conjecture relative to lord Arling|ton?&mdash;and if he knew of any intercour&s;e having ever &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between him and the hou&s;e of St. Foix?'</P>
<P>Mar&s;ini replied, 'Indeed, madam, I do not know that lord Arlington ever had any acquaintance with my dear wife's family. That idea was &s;ugge&s;ted to me by the anxiety which he &s;eemed to have for the fate of Antoinette, and his thorough knowledge of her &s;tory; be&s;ides that, his lord&s;hip, according to what I under&s;tand, from the relation you gave me, mu&s;t have been abroad at the time I &s;peak of.'</P>

My affection to the child, and my attention to the reque&s;t of a hu&s;band I &s;o much loved, would not have been le&s;s, had he waved the &s;ubject of her birth entirely, and that, I

think he mu&s;t have known me well enough to be a&s;|&s;ured of it.'</P>
<P>'Yet,' &s;aid Mar&s;ini, 'I cannot give up my belief, that I have di&s;covered the mother of Antoinette.&mdash; That picture,&mdash;Oh!

<P>'Oh! moderate your tran&s;ports, my worthy friend,' &s;aid Antoinette. 'You have, indeed, &s;hort as our acquaintance has been, &s;hewn to me the kindne&s;s, the affection of a father;&mdash;but, What do you now mean?

<P>The conver&s;ation continued &s;ome time longer; but the more the matter was talked over, the le&s;s rea&s;on did there &s;eem to be for Mar&s;ini's belief, that he had di&s;covered the mother of Antoinette.

<P>THE &s;ummer was now on the decline, and autumn began to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inge the &s;urrounding woods with her varied hues, which made mrs. Percival turn her thoughts towards returning to England, where it was her in|tention to &s;pend the next year and half, when &s;he meant Henry &s;hould go abroad. When &s;he fir&s;t men|tioned to Antoinette her idea of leaving Arlington, &s;he de&s;ired her, at the &s;ame time, to &s;ay whether &s;he would like to pa&s;s the winter in London, or whether &s;he would prefer remaining in Ireland; &s;trongly &s;u&s;|pecting, that the latter would be her choice: and as her principal object in returning to England, was to introduce Antoinette into the world (for Henry, &s;he thought, in very good hands, under doctor Schom|berg), if her wi&s;h was rather for retirement, &s;he would certainly not think of taking her out of it, con|trary to her inclination.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="038283_0117_101196D49A609BF8">Antoinette &s;aid, 'Since you, my deare&s;t madam, are &s;o kind as to leave this matter entirely to my choice, I will freely own, that my wi&s;h is, at pre&s;ent, to remain where I am. I think, while I am here, I have more chance of making di&s;coveries relative to my own &s;tory, than if I were to be at &s;uch a di&s;tance as London, where I &s;hould con&s;tantly be haunted with the idea, that &s;omething was pa&s;&s;ing here of import|ance to me.'</P>
<P>The&s;e rea&s;ons were quite &s;ufficient for mrs. Perci|val, as, indeed, would the bare expre&s;&s;ion of An|toinette's wi&s;h have been, without her a&s;&s;igning any rea&s;on at all for it; and &s;he re&s;olved to give up all thoughts of England.</P>
<P>Mar&s;ini, who&s;e whole &s;oul was wrapt up in An|toinette, when he found &s;he was likely to remain at Arlington, took a &s;mall hou&s;e, which was then va|cant in the neighbourhood, at which, however, he &s;pent but little of his time; as he was every day, and almo&s;t all day long, at the ca&s;tle; but his behaviour to her was changed entirely from that of the lover, to the father. This attachment furni&s;hed an ample topic of conver&s;ation to all the neighbourhood, and occa&s;ioned the long forgotten &s;tory of Theodore's abrupt departure to be revived, as an appendage to that of Mar&s;ini and Antoinette; and many were the expre&s;&s;ions of a&s;toni&s;hment u&s;ed, whenever the affair was canva&s;&s;ed, that Mar&s;ini, circum&s;tanced as he ap|prehended he was with regard to her, &s;hould enter|tain a partiality for her;&mdash;an a&s;toni&s;hment which, I doubt not, has been anticipated by many of my read|ers; for, according to all e&s;tabli&s;hed forms in the world, the deception, which he was well convinced, had been practi&s;ed on him by his wife, ought to have rendered Antoinette the object of his hatred, however &s;trongly her youth, beauty, and, above all, her bene|volent and amiable di&s;po&s;ition, might plead in her behalf. I will not pretend to apologize for his thus tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the rules of cu&s;tom. I only give the

<P>Francis Delaval, who had at fir&s;t felt the greate&s;t tran&s;ports, when he found all ideas of rival<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> be|tween Mar&s;ini and him&s;elf done away, did not, how|ever, find, as time moved onwards, that the removal of that ob&s;tacle had greatly brightened his pro&s;pects.

<P>Mr. Delaval &s;aw his &s;on's &s;ituation with the deepe&s;t concern. It was plain that his happine&s;s depended wholly on the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Antoinette: and he would
<PB N="120" REF="038283_0119_101196DA2334EC98">
have done any thing in his power to forward an union between them: but he &s;aw plainly the &s;trong rea&s;ons &s;he had to guard her heart again&s;t any ap|proaches of a pa&s;&s;ion, which might, if indulged, ul|timately involve her in ruin and wretchedne&s;s.</P>
<P>Things were in this &s;ituation, when an event hap|pened, which threatened to hurl mrs. Percival and her family from the height of wealth and affluence, to a comparative &s;tate of poverty, by depriving them of the e&s;tates annexed to the barony of Arlington, which, as the greate&s;t part of mrs. Percival's fortune had been &s;unk in freeling them from incumbrances, were now almo&s;t their only po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The next heir to the e&s;tates and title of Arlington, &s;uppo&s;ing Theodore to have died childle&s;s, was a di&s;tant relation of the family, who had lived for &s;ome years at Mar&s;eilles: as the cheap living in that &s;outhern part of France, enabled him to &s;upport a better ap|pearance, with a very &s;mall fortune, than he could have done in England or Ireland. This man hav|ing, in his youth, quarreled with the father of Theo|dore, no intercour&s;e had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the two branches of the family from that time, and mrs. Per|cival, though &s;he had heard of &s;uch a per&s;on, did not know whether he was alive or not.</P>
<P>This man now &s;uddenly appeared at Dublin, to lay claim to the e&s;tates and title of Arlington, under the plea that he had &s;ufficient evidence to bring forward, that Theodore was married, during his re&s;idence abroad to a French lady, who was alive at the time that he married mi&s;s Conolly, con&s;equently, that the marriage with her was illegal, and the &s;on he had by that marriage, could not inherit; and that Theodore having died &s;ome months before in the We&s;t-Indies, the title and e&s;tates of cour&s;e devolved upon him.</P>
<P>This was a &s;troke &s;o &s;udden, &s;o unexpected, and carrying &s;uch dreadful con&s;equences in its train, that it would have broken down the minds of the gene|rality of females; but that of mrs. Percival was &s;u|perior
<PB N="121" REF="038283_0120_101196DC256F0DB8">
to mo&s;t of her &s;ex. She &s;aw plainly, that if mr. Thomas Percival could &s;ub&s;tantiate the facts which he had alleged, the ca&s;e was clear, and &s;he mu&s;t &s;ubmit to her fate; to the hard&s;hips of which &s;he could not be in&s;en&s;ible, but which &s;he was re&s;olved to meet with fortitude. She was inured to troubles, and had learnt by them, le&s;&s;ons of philo&s;ophy, which would enable her to adapt her ideas to any &s;ituation in life, convinced that there is none &s;o elevated, as to be ex|empt from troubles; nor any &s;o low as to be devoid of comforts. She could not charge her&s;elf with any thing culpable in her conduct, unle&s;s it were the marrying Theodore, when &s;he was &s;en&s;ible that &s;he was not the object of his choice. But with regard to her &s;on, though his birth might not be legal, &s;he was guiltle&s;s in that re&s;pect; for her mind had no &s;hare in the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, which, therefore, in the eye both of God and man, could not be con&s;idered as one.</P>
<P>With the&s;e, and various other reflections of the like kind, &s;he fortified her mind again&s;t the &s;torms which &s;he had now to encounter; and with the mo&s;t un&s;haken firmne&s;s and compo&s;ure, ordered every thing to be prepared for her immediate departure with her family to Dublin.</P>
<P>When Francis Delaval heard of the &s;ituation into which the family that contained his adored Antoi|nette, was likely to be thrown, he immediately applied to his father for his con&s;ent, that he might throw him&s;elf at her feet, and offer her a heart and hand devoted to her, and by accepting which, &s;he would be placed out of the reach of tho&s;e &s;hafts, which the malice of fortune was aiming at the unfortunate mrs. Percival and her &s;on. And this con&s;ideration, added to the &s;till more powerful one, that &s;he might then be enabled to make &s;ome acknowledgment, more &s;olid than in words only, for the immen&s;e weight of favours, which &s;he had received from the hands of mrs. Per|cival, Francis hoped would operate on her mind, as an inducement to her to lay a&s;ide her &s;cruples, and
<PB N="122" REF="038283_0121_101196E175A47BA0">
accept an offer, which, under other circum&s;tances, &s;he might have refu&s;ed. He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s not, too, quite without hopes, that the genero&s;ity of temp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r, which this offer would carry on the face of it, might ope|rate in his favour, on a mind &s;o open as that of An|toinette, to every virtuous impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mr. Delaval, who&s;e di&s;po&s;ition was not behind hand in genero&s;ity with his &s;on, entered with ardour into all his feelings and views, and ordered him imme|diately to proceed in the affair, as his own wi&s;hes &s;hould dictate to him; though he ob&s;erved, at the &s;ame time, that Antoinette had a friend in Mar&s;ini, who would prevent her being involved in the fate of mrs. Percival and her &s;on.</P>
<P>Francis lo&s;t no time, but immediately repaired to Arlington ca&s;tle, where, enquiring for mi&s;s Percival he was told, that &s;he was in the garden, where he would find her. To the garden, therefore, he re|paired, where &s;he was taking a &s;olitary walk, in|dulging in the melancholy reflection, that it was, perhaps, the la&s;t &s;he might ever take there. He opened his errand by &s;aying, 'I come not now, deare&s;t madam, to intrude un&s;ea&s;onably on your &s;or|rows; but I could not &s;upport the thought of your leaving this place, to which, alas! you may perhaps never return, without laying open my mind to you.'</P>
<P>'Surely, fair Antoinette,' &s;aid he, taking her hand gently, which &s;he had not power to withhold from him, 'my outward actions cannot have been &s;uch unfaithful interpreters of my internal feelings, as to leave you any doubt of the ardour of my affection for you. I know very well,' he continued, 'the rea&s;ons you have for wi&s;hing to keep your&s;elf free from any engagement of the kind, which my heart pants to propo&s;e to you; but, deare&s;t Antoinette, con&s;ider, that your &s;cruples in this in&s;tance are quite done away. Though you are unfortunately a &s;tranger to your con|nections, mine are well known; nor can you, in uniting your&s;elf to me, run any ri&s;k of forming a con|nection,
<PB N="123" REF="038283_0122_101196E440D8A108">
which the ties of blood would prohibit. No &s;ecret connections on the part of my father or mother, have rendered my birth doubtful; it can therefore no ways interfere with your's. Surely, then, my An|toinette, I have removed all ob&s;tacles to our union on that account; and, will you not, therefore, per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> me to hope, that the offer I here make you, of a heart and hand devoted to you, may not be unfavourably received? Believe me, and I &s;peak no common cant, but what I &s;ay comes from the bottom of my heart, that my future happine&s;s or mi&s;ery depends on your acceptance or rejection of my propo&s;als. I wait your an&s;wer,' &s;aid he, pre&s;&s;ing her hand to his bo&s;om, 'Oh!' let it be favourable.&mdash;I have &s;ometimes dared to hope, that I was not ab&s;olutely indifferent to you.'</P>
<P>Tears flowed fa&s;t down the cheeks of his fair au|ditor, while Francis made this harangue, to which &s;he replied,</P>
<P>'Had any doubts exi&s;ted in my heart, mr. Dela|val, of the true genero&s;ity and &s;weetne&s;s of your di&s;|po&s;ition, and of the &s;incerity of your affection for me, the pre&s;ent moment mu&s;t at once have di&s;pelled them; but I wanted not this in&s;tance to convince me, that your &s;oul is the &s;eat of benevolence and philanthropy.&mdash;Oh! that you had not taken me at a moment, when &s;orrow had loo&s;ened the chains with which I have endeavoured to guard every avenue of my heart!&mdash;But I cannot now di&s;&s;emble.&mdash;Yes, mr.

I wi&s;h I felt le&s;s forcibly the truth of this confe&s;&s;ion; but let me intreat you to be con|tented, at pre&s;ent, with the knowledge of my regard for you, nor pre&s;s me farther to enter into engage|ments, which I mu&s;t ab&s;olutely refu&s;e.</P>
<P>'I grant the ju&s;tice of the ob&s;ervations you have made, with regard to my principal objection to mar|rying, and that objection, I own, is entirely done away in my mind, with regard to giving my hand to you;&mdash;but &s;till I mu&s;t at pre&s;ent refu&s;e, ab&s;olutely

<P>'Oh no,' exclaimed Francis, interrupting her. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible. I never did, and I hope never &s;hall, repent of following the dictates of an open, undi&s;gui&s;ed heart, which has not a thought that it wi&s;hes to conceal from the world.'</P>
<P>'Yet con&s;ider,' returned Antoinette, 'if not for your own &s;ake, for mine at lea&s;t, con&s;ider, my pre&s;ent &s;ituation. My benefactre&s;s, my more than mother, is likely to be reduced from affluence to poverty; and though, from the kindne&s;s and affection of count Mar&s;ini, I have a pro&s;pect of not being involved in her ruin, yet con&s;ider whether you can, your&s;elf, think it a proper time for me to accept your propo|&s;als.&mdash;Oh! no: a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf of my ardent affection for you, but forbear to urge me to an engagement, which my judgment tells me I ought not to enter into. Should the generous &s;entiments which you now profe&s;s for me, continue &s;ome time hence. I may then, with more propriety, accept your propo&s;als, if you &s;hould think proper to renew them:&mdash;but at pre&s;ent, I entreat you, as you value my peace, to urge me no farther.'</P>
<P>Francis &s;ilently acquie&s;ced in the &s;entence, which Antoinette had thus pa&s;&s;ed on him. He entered into all her feelings on the &s;ubject, which he could not entirely di&s;approve; and as he had gained an a&s;&s;ur|ance from her own lips, of her affection for him, his heart was much more at ea&s;e. After taking a mo&s;t affectionate leave of her, therefore&punc; he withdrew, to bid farewel to the re&s;t of the family, who were to &s;et out for Dublin the next day.</P>

<P>Francis was, however, comforted for the lo&s;s of his mi&s;tre&s;s, by hearing his father declare his intention of going to Dublin very &s;oon to &s;pend the winter there.</P>
<P>When mrs. Percival arrived in that city, her fir&s;t care was to engage, on her &s;ide, &s;ome of the mo&s;t able men in the law department, by who&s;e advice &s;he &s;olicited an interview with her antagoni&s;t, which re|que&s;t he po&s;itively refu&s;ed to grant, &s;aying, 'That the only intercour&s;e which could po&s;&s;ibly pa&s;s between them, mu&s;t be by means of their re&s;pective agents.' Several meetings accordingly pa&s;&s;ed between them, by which mr. Byrne and mr. Fitzpatrick, mrs. Per|cival's
<PB N="127" REF="038283_0126_101196EF608AB810">
two principal council, got an in&s;ight into the evidence which the claimant had to bring forward.</P>
<P>The witne&s;&s;es to be produced to the marriage, were Pierre Dupont, and Jeanne Berger, a man and wo|man who had been &s;ervants at the Cele&s;tine convent of Sainte Marguerite, on the banks of the Rhone, about fourteen miles from the city of Vienne, in the Province of Dauphin&eacute;. The account they gave of the affair, and which they &s;aid they were ready to depo&s;e on oath, was 'That a rumour ari&s;ing in the convent, at a time which they mentioned, (and which was about eighteen years before that, at which they were giving in their relation) that &s;ome days before one of the nuns had been married to a gentleman at the cell of the confe&s;&s;or of the convent, which gen|tleman was &s;ecretly introduced at night, by the con|nivance of one of the &s;uperiors of the convent, to the chamber of his wife; they determined, if po&s;&s;i|ble to inve&s;tigate the matter, in hopes, as they &s;aid, of bringing wretches, who could be guilty of &s;uch profanation, to condign puni&s;hment. The confe&s;&s;or died &s;uddenly very &s;oon after. They went, therefore, immediately to his cell, in hopes of finding &s;omething there, which might lead them to di&s;cover the truth of this dark affair.</P>
<P>In the cell they found a paper, containing the fol|lowing memorandum, which they brought away with them, and which was to be produced in evidence on the trial: <LETTER>
<P>'I An&s;elm de la Bruyere, confe&s;&s;or of the Cele&s;tine convent of Sainte Marguerite, in the province of Dauphin&eacute;, think it proper by the following paper to te&s;tify, le&s;t any doubt of the validity of the marriage &s;hould hereafter ari&s;e; and I do hereby te&s;tify, that I did, on this day, unite in holy wedlock, with all due forms and ceremonies, Theodore Percival, of the king|dom of Ireland, and Antoinette de St. Foix. In wit|ne&s;s whereof, I have hereunto &s;et my hand and &s;eal,</P>

</LETTER></P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="038283_0127_101196F0EFA2ABF0">This paper was al&s;o &s;igned by two witne&s;&s;es, as be|ing pre&s;ent at the marriage, under the names of Cle|ment Sequin, and Marianne de Mercier; the former of whom, as the &s;ervants &s;aid, was a friar of a neigh|bouring mona&s;tery, who was often with An&s;elm, and the latter the &s;uperior, who was reported to have in|troduced the gentleman into the men's chamber. This paper, they &s;aid, they intended to have given to the lady abbe&s;s, and at the &s;ame time to have related to her the report they had heard; but having had a quarrel with her very &s;oon after, for which they were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the convent in ha&s;te, they, in revenge, kept the &s;tory &s;ecret. But, &s;ome years after, Pierre Du|pont coming to vi&s;it &s;ome friends in the neighbour|hood of the convent, heard that the nun and Marianne had ju&s;t made their e&s;cape from it together.</P>
<P>The fact of Theodore's death was to be atte&s;ted by two French &s;ailors, who could depo&s;e, that about a year or a little more back, a per&s;on, who was called Theodore Percival, was brought &s;trongly guarded to Rochelle, and put on board the &s;hip to which they belonged, which was one of a fleet of merchant &s;hips bound to St. Domingo; that he remained on board all the time of their pa&s;&s;age to St. Domingo; and after he was landed at that i&s;land came frequently down to vi&s;it the &s;hip; but after &s;ome time he caught a fever, and died there. The de&s;cription they gave of the per&s;on of this man, exactly corre&s;ponded to that of lord Arlington; and his own extraordinary conduct, threw a &s;hade of probability over the whole narrative, which left no room to doubt of its truth.</P>
<P>'And what evidence had the defendants to bring on the other &s;ide?&mdash;None&mdash;the ca&s;e &s;eemed, there|fore, a lo&s;t one. But, notwith&s;tanding, mr. Byrne and mr. Fitzpatrick advi&s;ed mrs. Percival to &s;tand the trial, as it was po&s;&s;ible that contradictions might ari&s;e in the depo&s;itions of the&s;e witne&s;&s;es, which might tend to invalidate their evidence.</P>
<P>On the whole, however, it appeared to mrs. Perci|val,
<PB N="129" REF="038283_0128_101196F2AAB1FA38">
that &s;he had nothing now to expect but the lo&s;s of her fortune, and that, in con&s;equence, her &s;on and her&s;elf would be reduced to very &s;trait circum&s;tances. She experienced, however, a great con&s;olation in the friend&s;hip of Mar&s;ini, and of the Delavals, who were come to Dublin. The former made the mo&s;t kind and liberal offers of an a&s;ylum to the whole family, in his country, if affairs &s;hould take the ill turn that was to be expected; and both he and Francis Delaval offered to take a journey, to the convent of Sainte Marguerite, to gain, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;ome farther in&s;ight into the extraordinary tran&s;action, which was reported to have happened there.</P>
<P>This was mentioned to mr. Byrne and mr. Fitzpa|trick; but their opinion was, that it was be&s;t, at lea&s;t, to delay the journey, 'till they &s;aw more pl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y what turn the bu&s;ine&s;s was likely to take; and if a verdict was given again&s;t them; it was then po&s;&s;ible that evi|dence might be collected there, on which to ground a motion for a new trial. But if they were to go at that time, it was &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible they could return before the day fixed for the trial; and on the whole, it was better to let the cau&s;e have a hearing, before they proceeded to any farther &s;teps, and to re&s;t on the po&s;|&s;ibility of the evidence produced by the claimant not being deemed &s;ufficient by the judge and jury, to ob|tain a verdict in his favour.</P>
<P>At length the day of the trial arrived. The depo|&s;itions of the two &s;ervants of the convent were to the effect above-mentioned. When they were cro&s;s-ex|amined by the defendant's council, it appeared that they had quitted the country immediately after they were di&s;charged from the convent, and that the only rea&s;on Pierre Dupont had for &s;aying that Antoinette de St. Foix had eloped from the convent &s;ome years after was, his hearing there that one of the nuns had e&s;caped with Marianne; and as &s;he was a witne&s;s to Antoinette's marriage, he concluded the nun to be no other than that lady her&s;elf. A bold conclu&s;ion,
<PB N="130" REF="038283_0129_101196F66F04E168">
which could by no means &s;tand as evidence in a court of law however &s;trong the pre&s;umption might be, that he was in the right.</P>
<P>There was no evidence, therefore, to prove that Antoinette was alive at the time that Theodore was married to mi&s;s Conolly; but neither, on the other hand, was there any evidence to prove her death be|fore that time; and as the fact of the fir&s;t marriage was e&s;tabli&s;hed, it became the part of the defendant to prove, that the &s;econd marriage had not taken place 'till after the fir&s;t was di&s;&s;olved by the death of one of the parties.</P>
<P>Pierre and Jeanne were next examined, as to the manner of their becoming acquainted with mr. Tho|mas Percival at Mar&s;eilles, and for what rea&s;on they had put the paper in que&s;tion into his hands. They an&s;wered to the&s;e que&s;tions, that they went to Mar|&s;eilles about two years after they had left the con|vent, having lived, during that two years, at Lyons; and as their view in going to Mar&s;eilles, was to get into &s;ervice there, Pierre, at the recommendation of a friend, was &s;oon hired as footman into mr. Percival's family. As the name of his ma&s;ter was the &s;ame as that of the gentleman, the certificate of who&s;e mar|riage they had found in An&s;elm's cell, he con&s;ulted with Jeanne, whether they &s;hould not offer him the paper, (which might, perhaps, be of value to him) if he would give them a good &s;um of money for it.</P>
<P>This being &s;ettled between them, the offer was made, and mr. Percival readily con&s;ented to purcha&s;e the paper, at the price they demanded; and they be|lieved it had never been out of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;ince. They had, however, thought no more about it, 'till not long &s;ince, when mr. Percival had a&s;ked them to accompany him to Ireland, for the purpo&s;e of atte&s;ting all they knew, relative to the marriage, of which, that paper was the certificate; and told them, they &s;hould be well paid for it; upon which they readily con|&s;ented to his reque&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="038283_0130_101196FA391DFE78">The&s;e people al&s;o po&s;itively &s;wore to An&s;elm's hand-writing in the certificate, having often &s;een him write during three years, that one had lived in the convent, and two years, that the other had been en|gaged in its &s;ervice.</P>
<P>Mr. Percival him&s;elf was then examined, as to the rea&s;on of his having kept the certificate of Theo|dore's marriage &s;o long concealed, and at la&s;t produc|ing it.</P>
<P>He &s;aid, 'That he thought his rea&s;ons for doing &s;o, mu&s;t be obvious to every one, nor &s;hould he at|tempt to di&s;gui&s;e them. He had fir&s;t purcha&s;ed the paper, and afterwards kept it for the very purpo&s;e for which it was now produced. He knew him&s;elf to be the next heir to the Arlington e&s;tates, if Theodore died without lawful heirs; and he therefore con|ceived it very po&s;&s;ible, that it might be of great &s;er|vice to him&s;elf, to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a paper, containing a certificate of a marriage of that &s;ame Theodore's, in &s;uch a &s;ecret way; and that when once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it, he had kept it with care, 'till the moment &s;hould arrive when he could turn it to his own advantage, which moment he conceived to be at length arrived.</P>
<P>The two French &s;ailors were next called, who were to prove the death of Theodore, the heads of who&s;e depo&s;ition have been already given. In their cro&s;s-examination, they too were que&s;tioned as to the man|ner in which they became known to the claimant, of which they gave the following account:</P>
<P>That at their return from St. Domingo, after the voyage, when they had carried over Theodore Per|cival, they quitted the merchant of Rochelle, in who&s;e &s;ervice they had been, on account of a quarrel which they had, in their return home, with the captain of the &s;hip; and one of them having relations at Mar|&s;eilles, they went thither, in hopes of getting employ|ment in their profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>They had not been many days at Mar&s;eilles, be|fore they became acquainted with Pierre Dupont,
<PB N="132" REF="038283_0131_101196FBEC4DB878">
who had not long been known to their relations; and hearing him often mention his ma&s;ter, by the name of Percival, it brought to their mind the unfortunate man of that name, who had been pa&s;&s;enger in their &s;hip, and who died at St. Domingo; and in the cour&s;e of conver&s;ation one day with Pierre, they mentioned that circum&s;tance, but with no other view, than as relating a &s;tory, which a &s;imilarity of names had brought to their minds.</P>
<P>Not long after this, Pierre told them, that his ma&s;|ter wi&s;hed to &s;peak with them; and when they went to him, he que&s;tioned them clo&s;ely re&s;pecting the &s;tory which they had told to his &s;ervant; in con&s;equence of which, they gave him a full detail of all that they knew re&s;pecting Theodore Percival; but at that fir&s;t interview, nothing more pa&s;&s;ed. They afterwards frequently &s;aw mr. Thomas Percival, and he always examined them about the &s;tory, and at la&s;t he a&s;ked them, 'If they would be willing to go with him to Ireland, in order to make oath, before a court of law, of the &s;everal circum&s;tances, which, at different times, they had related to him; to which they readily con&s;ented.'</P>
<P>They were then a&s;ked by mrs. Percival's council, what reward had been promi&s;ed them for the trouble they were to take. They he&s;itated at fir&s;t; but then affirmed, that they were to have no recompen&s;e, only to have their expen&s;es paid, and a remuneration for their lo&s;s of time, and were to be furni&s;hed with em|ployment, if they &s;hould choo&s;e to &s;tay in Ireland ra|ther than return to France. On being hard pre&s;&s;ed, however, it appeared, that the remuneration for their lo&s;s of time, was to be at a mo&s;t extravagant rate, for they were to be paid about ten times the &s;um per day, that they could have earned in their u&s;ual occupation; and at la&s;t it was dragged forth, that if by their evidence, the claimant &s;hould obtain po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the conte&s;ted e&s;tates, they were each to have a con&s;iderable annuity &s;ettled on them for their lives.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="038283_0132_101196FD86DDFAF8">This was, alone, enough to &s;hake the credit of the evidence given by the&s;e fellows. But when they were more particularly and &s;eparately examined, as to the circum&s;tances of Theodore Percival's death, they were neither con&s;i&s;tent with each other, nor with their own former depo&s;itions, in the account they gave of it; neither did they agree in the time that elap&s;ed be|tween his being landed at St. Domingo, and his death. On the whole, the evidence of the&s;e men was de|clared by the judge, and thought by the whole court, to be of too a doubtful a nature, to carry any weight with it, 'till unfortunately a paper was brought for|ward, for the purpo&s;e of corroborating their te&s;timony, which, in a moment, turned the face of affairs. This paper purpo&s;ed to be a copy of the minutes taken by the captain of the &s;hip in which Theodore was a pa&s;|&s;enger, during his voyage to St. Domingo, his &s;tay at that i&s;land, and return home, in which was a circum|&s;tantial detail of the illne&s;s and death of Theodore, intermingled with &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions of &s;orrow for his fate, and encomiums on the goodne&s;s of his heart and under&s;tanding, and on his affable and plea&s;ing deport|ment during his pa&s;&s;age: and two men, one the cap|tain's mate, and the other his &s;teward, &s;wore to it as a faithful copy.</P>
<P>This was evidence not to be re&s;i&s;ted, when depo&s;ed in court on oath; though &s;till a &s;u&s;picion pervaded the minds of many of the auditors, that there was &s;ome vile collu&s;ion practi&s;ed. By &s;ome it was &s;u&s;|pected, that mr. Percival, the claimant, was even the murderer of his relation; but others were content to &s;uppo&s;e, that he had not only taken care to remove him out of the way &s;o far, as that he might never be in danger of returning to bring him to &s;hame; and it was thought, by the&s;e, not improbable, that he might be &s;old as a &s;lave in St. Domingo. Few people thought that his fate was really known.</P>
<P>But whatever private opinions might be formed on this intere&s;ting &s;ubject, private opinions could not in|fluence
<PB N="134" REF="038283_0133_10119700735C50C0">
a judge and jury. They could be guided only by the po&s;itive evidence, which was &s;uch, that they were under the nece&s;&s;ity of giving a verdict for the plaintiff.</P>
<P>Mar&s;ini, who had attended in court during the whole time of the trial, in order that he might early the fir&s;t tidings of the event to mrs. Percival, no &s;ooner heard the verdict given, than he departed, to acquaint her with it. She heard it with unruffled &s;e|renity, and only ob&s;erved,</P>
<P>'Well, then, I mu&s;t adapt my ideas, and teach my children to adapt theirs, to live on the little we have remaining, and my Henry, in&s;tead of leading an idle life, mu&s;t work for his bread. We are atoms in the immen&s;ity of creation, and mu&s;t perform the part allotted us, nor will it be performed in vain. One thing, however, is by tho&s;e means cleared up to us, and we know, at la&s;t, who are the parents of our dear Antoinette!'</P>
<P>'Indeed,' &s;aid Mar&s;ini, I think we mu&s;t now con|clude, (for it can &s;carcely be doubted) that Antoi|nette is the daughter of lord Arlington's fir&s;t marriage.'</P>
<P>'It is &s;urely &s;o,' an&s;wered mrs. Percival, 'and wi&s;ely did he direct that &s;he &s;hould be taught to gain her living by her own indu&s;try, if nece&s;&s;ary. Per|haps he even fore&s;aw the probability of the pre&s;ent event taking place. One thing only wounds me, that he could be &s;o ungenerous as to pretend to marry me, when he had another wife alive. What motive could he have for &s;uch ba&s;e conduct?&mdash;What motive in|deed?&mdash;Alas! I wrong him; he could not do &s;o; I am &s;ure he could not?&mdash;He was mi&s;erable, I know, too well I know it&mdash;but even now I cannot believe he was guilty. Perhaps there are yet many circum|&s;tances in his &s;tory, with which we are unacquainted, for it is &s;till dark and my&s;terious&mdash;time may di&s;cover more, and if it is part of the &s;cheme of Providence, that more &s;hould be di&s;covered, no human arts can conceal it.'</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="038283_0134_1011970227D22720">'Indeed,' replied Mar&s;ini, 'I am &s;o well con|vinced that &s;ome vile collu&s;ion has been practi&s;ed, that I am re&s;olved to go immediately my&s;elf to the convent of Sainte Marguerite, for the purpo&s;e of far|ther inve&s;tigating the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of the marri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ge; and, if I find no &s;atisfaction there, to pur&s;ue my &s;earches to &s;uch other parts, as afford a pro&s;pect of opening any light to us.

I can &s;upply you with every thing you want at pre&s;ent; if you recover your e&s;tates, I will then be repaid, and if not, my fortune is &s;ufficient for us all.

<P>Mrs. Percival, who had heard with perfect equani|mity of temper her terrible rever&s;e of fortune, could not, with equal calmne&s;s, attend to this &s;peech of Mar&s;ini's.

<P>MARSINI communicated his intended journey to mr. Byrne and mr.

<P>When Francis Delaval heard of Mar&s;ini's inten|tions, he immediately begged to be permitted to ac|company him; to which his father and the count very readily con&s;ented; and accordingly, they &s;et off together, in a very few days after.</P>
<P>They arrived at the convent of Sainte Marguerite, without meeting with any occurrence worth relating. They reque&s;ted to &s;ee the lady abbe&s;s, to whom they were immediately introduced; when they re|lated to her their &s;tory, and communicated the er|rand

they were come upon. When they had done, &s;he exclaimed,</P>
<P>'Heavens! what a wonderful coincidence!&mdash;Yes, gentlemen, you will indeed receive here all the &s;a|tisfaction you can wi&s;h for, and much more than you can have dared to expect. The marriage you mention, did indeed take place, and the unfortunate lady died in le&s;s than a year after; but what is more than all, know that the very man who&s;e death has been &s;o po&s;itively &s;worn to, is now in the chapel of the convent, weeping over the tomb of his beloved wife. &mdash;If you will follow me, I will conduct you to him.'</P>
<P>She aro&s;e. Mar&s;ini and Francis followed her. On entering the chapel, they beheld, at the upper end of it, a pale, wretched, emaciated figure, &s;tanding by a &s;mall monument, on which he re&s;ted one elbow, while his head reclined on his hand, and in the other hand he held a picture, on which his eyes were im|moveably fixed. Near was an old nun, kneeling be|fore an altar, who &s;eemed enthu&s;ia&s;tically ab&s;orbed in her devotions; both together forming a &s;olemn and affecting &s;pectacle, for each was too entirely occu|pied with their own meditations, to appear to notice the other, or even to be &s;en&s;ible of the entrance of the abbe&s;s, Mar&s;ini, and Francis.</P>
<P>As they approached Theodore, 'Behold,' &s;aid the lady abbe&s;s, 'the man, who&s;e exi&s;tence will put an end to your troubles.' Then coming up to him, &s;he &s;aid, in a voice loud enough to be heard by the old nun, 'Mr. Percival.'&mdash;The nun &s;tarted up, as if &s;truck by an electrical &s;hock;</P>

<P>'Mr. Percival,' repeated the abbe&s;s.</P>
<P>'Great God!' exclaimed the nun, 'Theodore Percival.'</P>
<P>'Yes, Theodore Percival,' replied the abbe&s;s.</P>
<P>'Awful heaven!&mdash;My &s;on &mdash; my &s;on!' cried the nun, and fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the pavement.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="038283_0137_1011970C119E48D0">Her la&s;t words rou&s;ed Theodore from his lethargy. 'What did I hear,' he cried, 'God of heaven!

<P>'We know not,' &s;aid the abbe&s;s. 'We know no more than the words &s;he has this moment uttered.&mdash; But let us take her to the parlour, and endeavour to recal her &s;en&s;es.'</P>
<P>'Ah! &s;ir,' &s;aid Mar&s;ini to Theodore, who &s;till held the nun in his arms, though from his own weak|ne&s;s, he was &s;carcely able to &s;upport her, 'Let me a&s;&s;i&s;t you: you are incapable of &s;upporting another, you &s;eem &s;carcely able to &s;upport your&s;elf:&mdash;you &s;eem very ill and weak.'</P>
<P>Theodore, who at fir&s;t looked rather wild, now compo&s;ed his countenance;&mdash;'Yes, I am ill indeed,' he &s;aid, '&s;ick both in body and mind&mdash;overcome with a&s;toni&s;hment&mdash; Can this be indeed my mother?'</P>
<P>The abbe&s;s, by this time, had fetched a chair, and the nun was conveyed to the parlour, where, on pro|per applications being admini&s;tered, &s;he began to re|vive. The fir&s;t words &s;he uttered, were,</P>
<P>'Where is he?&mdash;Where is my &s;on&mdash;my Theo|dore?'</P>
<P>Theodore took her hand, 'And, is it then,' he &s;aid, 'my mother, whom I now behold?&mdash;Oh wonderful event! &mdash; after a &s;eparation of above thirty years, in all which time I knew not whether &s;he were alive or dead!'</P>
<P>'Yes,' &s;he &s;aid, 'I am indeed your mother, the infamous wife of Edward, lord Arlington.&mdash; Oh! Theodore! How little did I &s;uppo&s;e, that the wretched object I beheld on entering the chapel, was my &s;on&mdash;the child whom I &s;o &s;hamefully de&s;erted.&mdash; But ah! an&s;wer me quickly, how is it that I behold

<P>'No,' an&s;wered Theodore, 'Hara&s;s not your&s;elf, deare&s;t madam, with that idea&mdash;true, I have been a &s;ufferer, a &s;evere &s;ufferer, b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> I do not owe one atom of tho&s;e &s;ufferings to you&mdash;they were all, alas, &s;elf-in|curred.'</P>
<P>'Well, well,' &s;he &s;aid, in a hurried manner, 'Tell me all, then&mdash;tell me, does your father yet live?'</P>
<P>'No,' an&s;wered Theodore, 'He has long been at re&s;t; long been a tenant of the peaceful grave, whi|ther, a thou&s;and, and a thou&s;and times, I have wi&s;hed to follow him.'</P>
<P>'Have you then been &s;o very wretched?' &s;aid &s;he, 'But &s;ay, my Theodore, did your father, in his clo&s;e of life, ever think of me? &mdash;Ah! he would have been a kind hu&s;band, had I known how &s;ufficiently to prize him.'</P>
<P>'Alas!' replied Theodore, 'I was not a witne&s;s to the latter &s;cenes of his life;&mdash;I clo&s;ed not his eyes;&mdash; I received not his parting breath;&mdash;I was then, and have been ever &s;ince, a voluntary exile from my home, my family,&mdash;I have been a wanderer for more than fifteen years;&mdash;I have ill-treated an excellent wife;&mdash; like you, too, my mother, I have de&s;erted my children. &mdash;But tho&s;e days are pa&s;t; I &s;hall &s;oon return to them, beg their forgivene&s;s, and hope to end my days in peace among&s;t them.'</P>
<P>Mar&s;ini, who had been deeply affected with the whole of the intere&s;ting &s;cene which was pa&s;&s;ing, could not here forbear to exclaim,</P>
<P>'Thanks! thanks be to heaven! Oh, what joy will your pre&s;ence diffu&s;e in your family!'</P>
<P>Theodore looked a&s;toni&s;hed; he had yet no idea who Mar&s;ini was, or what was his errand; but his attention being thus &s;uddenly arre&s;ted, he, in an eager and hurried tone, cried,</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="038283_0139_10119713725F1888">'How?&mdash;Do you know them then?&mdash;Tell me? &mdash;Are they all well?&mdash;Will they &s;ee me?&mdash;Speak&mdash; my heart is bur&s;ting.'</P>
<P>Mar&s;ini was alarmed, he thought that he had been too ha&s;ty; he &s;aw that Theodore's whole frame was convul&s;ed; weak and exhau&s;ted as he was, he could ill bear &s;uch agitation. But Mar&s;ini had now gone too far to recede.</P>
<P>'Yes,' he an&s;wered, 'I but lately left your wife and children at Dublin; they are well;&mdash;but, deare&s;t &s;ir, let me entreat you to attend to your&s;elf; you &s;hall hear &s;ome other time; let us take you hence, you are weak and ill;&mdash;Come, &s;ir, come with me.'</P>
<P>'What! and leave my mother ju&s;t as I have &s;ound her?'</P>
<P>He an&s;wered with a quickne&s;s, that proved in the cleare&s;t manner the conte&s;t of feelings in his bo&s;om.</P>
<P>'But be it &s;o; perhaps 'tis be&s;t; my head turns round;&mdash;&s;upport me.&mdash;I have not &s;lept nor re&s;ted from fatigue for three days and nights.'</P>
<P>Mar&s;ini &s;aw, indeed, that he was perfectly exhau&s;ted, and therefore, propo&s;ed to him, to accompany him to an inn, at a &s;hort di&s;tance from the convent, to which he was recommended by the abbe&s;s.</P>
<P>'Ah!' &s;aid Theodore, on hearing the inn named, 'I know the place well;&mdash;how many days have I &s;pent there!&mdash;days of &s;orrow and angui&s;h!&mdash;but no matter! 'tis over.' Then taking his mother's hand, he &s;aid, 'I will return to-morrow, I want nothing but re&s;t, and then we can exchange together our re&s;|pective &s;tories;&mdash;mine is a chain of di&s;a&s;ters.'</P>
<P>He had ju&s;t power to rai&s;e her hand to his lips, and then, &s;upported by Mar&s;ini and Francis, got into the carriage, and went with them to the inn. They got him there &s;ome refre&s;hment, after which he retired to re&s;t, and aro&s;e the next morning much refre&s;hed and amended.</P>
<P>It was now that he fir&s;t enquired of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ini and Francis, who they were; what had brought them to
<PB N="141" REF="038283_0140_10119716D3F2C7F0">
the convent; and how it happened, that they &s;eemed at once to have taken &s;o deep an intere&s;t in him and his concerns. To which enquiries Mar&s;ini an&s;wered, by relating to him all that had happened to his family &s;ince his departure. 'And now, &s;ir,' he added, 'let us lo&s;e no time, but immediately return to Ireland, and there put an end to the long years of anxiety which your family have &s;uffered on your account.'</P>
<P>'Yes,' &s;aid Theodore, 'I will u&s;e all the &s;peed in my power, but I dare not take the &s;horte&s;t route for my return; I am not in &s;afety while I continue in France; I have run a very great ri&s;que in coming into the kingdom again, but I could have had no peace of mind without it. It was my purpo&s;e, after my vi&s;it to Sainte Marguerite's convent ye&s;terday, im|mediately to have &s;et off for Geneva, as the &s;horte&s;t way out of the French territories, and after re&s;ting there a &s;hort time, to proceed on my journey, by the &s;horte&s;t and &s;afe&s;t route I could plan. But the ex|traordinary occurrence of meeting with my mother, determines me to go again to the convent, and after having &s;een her, and dropped a tear once more over the tomb of my Antoinette, I will proceed as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible from this &s;cene of peril.'</P>
<P>'Well then,' &s;aid Mar&s;ini, '&s;ince it mu&s;t be &s;o, we will take the &s;horte&s;t way to return to Ireland, and carry to your wife and family the welcome news, that you are on your way back to them. Oh! with what tran&s;port they will receive me, when I am the bearer of &s;uch tidings?'</P>
<P>'And, can my wife, then, wi&s;h to &s;ee me,' an&s;wered Theodore, 'after all the &s;ufferings I have occa&s;ioned her?&mdash;But I know her worth, and, though I de&s;erted her, I have never cea&s;ed to e&s;teem her.'</P>
<P>'Doubt not,' &s;aid Mar&s;ini, 'of the joy your pre|&s;ence will occa&s;ion; but,' he continued, 'cannot you give us &s;ome token by which more effectually to con|vince her, that we have &s;een you?&mdash;Will you not write to her?'</P>

<P>'And your &s;tory,' &s;aid Mar&s;ini, 'may I not be charged with that too?'</P>
<P>'No,' an&s;wered Theodore, 'it is long and full of di&s;a&s;ters:&mdash;Spare me the repetition of it now; at my return to Ireland, my wife &s;hall know all; when &s;he will own that though in &s;ome re&s;pects I am the ob|ject of cen&s;ure, in others I am an object of compa&s;|&s;ion.'</P>
<P>'Adieu, then, for the pre&s;ent,' &s;aid Mar&s;ini, 'I &s;hall &s;et out immediately; and tru&s;t, that you, &s;ir, will u&s;e no unnece&s;&s;ary delays.

<P>Theodore then embraced Mar&s;ini and Francis, making the warme&s;t acknowledgments for their kind|ne&s;s, and then &s;et off for Sainte Marguerite, while the latter proceeded towards Ireland.</P>
<P>When Theodore arrived at the convent, he found his mother tolerably compo&s;ed from the agitation oc|ca&s;ioned by the affecting &s;cene of the preceding day; when &s;he told him, that after the elopement from his father (as mentioned in the early part of this hi&s;tory) &s;he continued for &s;ome time with the man who then &s;e|duced her, and accompanied him to France; but he growing tired of her, con&s;igned her over to a French officer, with whom &s;he lived for two years in af|fluence, though not in comfort; for,' &s;aid &s;he, 'I was often haunted with remor&s;e for my pa&s;t conduct, and as often wi&s;hed I could recal my innocence, and the
<PB N="143" REF="038283_0142_1011971F357257B0">
affections of my hu&s;band: but ah! How difficult is it to retrieve one fal&s;e &s;tep! Much as I wi&s;hed to re|turn to him, I did not dare to attempt it, but, at length, the officer I lived with dying, I was turned out of doors by his heir, perfectly de&s;titute of every thing, but the clothes on my back, and the little money I had in my pocket, which did not altogether amount, to &s;o much as a louis-d'or.</P>
<P>'In this di&s;tre&s;s I knew not which way to turn; many times did I re&s;olve to &s;eek out my hu&s;band, throw my&s;elf at his feet, and beg his protection and forgivene&s;s, but, de&s;titute as I was of the means of taking &s;uch a journey, I knew not how to &s;et about it, and, with &s;hame I own it, I was al&s;o, in part, withheld by a fal&s;e pride, which did not know how to bend to the humiliation I mu&s;t undergo. I, there|fore, at la&s;t, took refuge in the greater humiliation of pro&s;titution, in which cour&s;e I continued for &s;everal years, enduring mi&s;eries which no imagination can conceive, that has not experienced them; 'till at la&s;t, I was rou&s;ed by an extraordinary circum&s;tance to a &s;hocking &s;en&s;e of the life I led, and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> re&s;olution to abandon it&punc; and take refuge in a clo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er, where I might hope by prayers, penitence and mortification, to wa&s;h out my offences.</P>
<P>'The circum&s;tance I allude to, was no other than the dreadful idea, that I had been led into a connexion with my own &s;on; with you, my Theodore. Oh! Never &s;hall I lo&s;e the remembrance of that moment, when fir&s;t the idea fla&s;hed on my mind! Hell! hell it&s;elf, can have no greater torments, than I than &s;uf|fered! I was preparing to fulfil an appointment I had made, when it was fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted to me&mdash;Oh God! Oh God!&mdash;I rolled on the floor for &s;ome time with agony, then &s;tarting up, I ran out of the hou&s;e, not knowing whither I went, nor what was my de&s;ign. In this &s;tate I was met by a man, who &s;eeing me look wild and di&s;tracted, took compa&s;&s;ion on me, and car|ried me to his hou&s;e, which was a &s;mall, but neat ha|bitation,
<PB N="144" REF="038283_0143_1011825615774CE0">
in the &s;uburbs of Paris. He a&s;ked me many que&s;tions, but it was a long time before I could give him a rational an&s;wer. At la&s;t, when he got to a knowledge of the cau&s;e of my di&s;traction, he &s;aid, he would go and inve&s;tigate the matter, and, leaving me under the care of his two &s;ervants, he &s;et forth on his benevolent purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>'He returned, after an ab&s;ence of about four hours, bringing with him the welcome news, that my fears were totally without foundation. The young man, whom I had apprehended from circum&s;tances to be you, my Theodore, was in fact an Iri&s;hman, but I was perfectly convinced quite a different per&s;on from him, whom I had dreaded finding him to be. The impre&s;&s;ion left on my mind, however, was &s;uch, that for worlds I could not have returned to my for|mer cour&s;e, and an impul&s;e of penitence and remor&s;e having thus &s;eized me, I in&s;tantly re&s;olved to quit a world, in which I had incurred &s;o much guilt and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>'I communicated to my benefactor the re&s;olution I had made, who encouraged me in it; and in order to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in carrying it into execution, applied, in my behalf, to the lady abbe&s;s of this convent, who con&s;ented to receive me; and here I have been ever &s;ince, which mu&s;t now be at lea&s;t fifteen years&punc; dur|ing the whole of that time, I have practi&s;ed the mo&s;t rigid au&s;terities, and been unremitted in my devo|tions&punc; and, I hope, I ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> now made my peace with God, &s;ince he has been &s;o gracious as to ble&s;s me with a &s;ight of my &s;on, before my eyes are clo&s;ed for ever.'</P>
<P>She cea&s;ed.&mdash;'Alas!' &s;aid Theodore, 'To what dreadful &s;cenes will a &s;ingle error often lead! And how forcibly is that po&s;ition illu&s;trated, by the fates of my father, my mother, my wives and my&s;elf! My father erred, in &s;uppo&s;ing, that the only thing nece&s;&s;ary to attach a woman to a life of retirement, was, that &s;he &s;hould be educated far from the luxuries

and vanities of the world. You erred, madam, in not exerting your re&s;olution to follow the fortunes of my father, whatever &s;ituation they might throw him into. I erred, in entering &s;ecretly into a matrimonial connexion, which I ought to have imparted to my father in an unre&s;erved manner. My fir&s;t wife erred, in a&s;&s;enting to, or even more than a&s;&s;enting to, in advi&s;ing the &s;ecrecy I ob&s;erved; and my pre&s;ent wife erred, in accepting my hand, when &s;he knew that my heart did not accompany it. And the long train of important and di&s;a&s;trous con&s;equences that have en|&s;ued from each of the&s;e re&s;pective errors, will &s;uffi|ciently &s;hew, that man can never deviate one inch from the &s;traight road of &s;incerity, or endeavour to &s;ub&s;titute fal&s;e rules of right, for tho&s;e immutable and infallible ones, laid down by the creator and lord of all things, without &s;uffering the puni&s;hment which every &s;uch deviation nece&s;&s;arily draws along with it.

<P>Theodore then related to her the hi&s;tory of his life, even from his boyi&s;h years; but as we &s;hall have oc|ca&s;ion to relate it el&s;ewhere, we forbear to give it a place here.</P>
<P>After &s;ome hours of conver&s;ation, in which he en|deavoured to per&s;uade his mother to let application to be made for a relea&s;e from her vows, that &s;he might come and end her days with him in Ireland, to which &s;he could by no means be brought to con&s;ent, Theo|dore took an affectionate leave of her.</P>
<P>He then vi&s;ited again the tomb of his wife, and procured an atte&s;ted copy of her death, from the re|gi&s;ter of the convent; when having &s;ettled all his af|fairs in tho&s;e parts, he proceeded on his journey, and arrived &s;afely and expeditiou&s;ly at Geneva.</P>

<P>MARSINI and Francis met with no interruption in their journey, and arrived again at Dublin after &s;o &s;hort an ab&s;ence, that mrs. Percival could, at fir&s;t &s;ight of them, &s;carcely believe that they had been to the di&s;tance which they intended at &s;etting out; but when they a&s;&s;ured her, that they had been at the con|vent of Sainte Marguerite, &s;he &s;aid, with a look of the mo&s;t eager anxiety;</P>
<P>'May I not hope, then, that your &s;peedy return is an indication, that you bring good news?'</P>
<P>Mar&s;ini, with his eyes &s;parkling with delight, ad|vanced to her, and taking her by the hand, &s;aid,</P>
<P>'I know by experience, deare&s;t lady, that the thunder-&s;troke of adver&s;ity has no power to &s;hake the firmne&s;s of your &s;oul;&mdash;but the gu&s;hing tide of joy's overflowing cup is harder &s;till to bear;&mdash;Say, can you &s;upport that too with equanimity of temper?'</P>
<P>'Oh, yes, yes, yes!' &s;he &s;aid, her heart palpitating all the time, as if it would bur&s;t the ca&s;e that enclo&s;ed it: 'I can, indeed, I can.&mdash;Tell me then at once, that my Theodore lives:&mdash;I read it in your eyes&mdash; your manner.'</P>
<P>'He does live, indeed,' &s;aid Mar&s;ini.</P>
<P>'Then heaven be prai&s;ed,' &s;he exclaimed, while convul&s;ive &s;obs and tears of ec&s;tacy, in which &s;he was joined by Henry and Antoinette, prevented her &s;ay|ing
<PB N="147" REF="038283_0146_101197294D335178">
more; nor could the &s;ympathizing count and Francis them&s;elves refrain from joining them. At la&s;t mrs. Percival recovering her&s;elf, &s;aid,</P>
<P>'Come, then, tell me all:&mdash;the bur&s;t of tran&s;port is over, and I can now hear your &s;tory with calmne&s;s.'</P>
<P>'Can you?' &s;aid Mar&s;ini, 'But what &s;ays my child, my Antoinette?&mdash;Will it not overcome her? And, can this dear youth, can Henry bear it?'</P>
<P>'Oh! yes,' they both &s;obbed out, 'indeed we can; you need not fear us.'</P>
<P>He then proceeded to relate all the particulars of his vi&s;it to the convent, and ended, with &s;aying, 'That he did not doubt, but that lord Arlington would &s;oon be in Ireland.' Then producing the let|ter, and the lock of hair, 'and for a farther proof, madam,' he added, 'that I have &s;een your hu&s;band, he charged me to be the bearer of the&s;e: my Henry,' he &s;aid, 'will remember, that I cut this hair from his head &s;even years ago.'</P>
<P>'Yes, well do I remember it,' &s;aid Henry: 'but, how little did I then &s;uppo&s;e, that it was my father, who a&s;ked &s;uch a boon of me!'</P>
<P>Mrs. Percival read the letter, which contained &s;uch pathetic expre&s;&s;ions of regret for all the &s;ufferings he had occa&s;ioned her, and &s;uch anxious wi&s;hes for the future happine&s;s of her, and his children, that &s;he could not read it without tears.</P>
<P>The next thing to be attended to, was to &s;ettle every thing with mr. Byrne and mr. Fitzpatrick, to whom Mar&s;ini immediately repaired, and imparted all the intelligence he had acquired; in con&s;equence of which, they proceeded according to the forms ne|ce&s;&s;ary to be ob&s;erved. A new trial was moved for, on the plea that lord Arlington was &s;till alive, and would &s;oon be in Ireland; and a day was appointed for rehearing the cau&s;e, at &s;uch a di&s;tant period, as it was thought would leave no doubt of lord Arlington's being arrived before that time.</P>
<P>But fortune &s;eemed determined to &s;port with the
<PB N="148" REF="038283_0147_1011972F1439F2B0">
feelings of lady Arlington to the la&s;t moment. Day after day pa&s;&s;ed over, and no lord Arlington appeared. Po&s;t after po&s;t arrived from the continent, but they brought no news of lord Arlington. The day ap|pointed for the trial approached; &s;till he was ab&s;ent. Lady Arlington grew unea&s;y&mdash;this negligence in her hu&s;band was wor&s;e than all his former conduct.&mdash; How could he be &s;o barbarous as to rai&s;e her hopes to &s;uch a height, only to da&s;h them down again with a ten-fold violence? Mar&s;ini, too, blamed him&s;elf very much for having left lord Arlington;&mdash;a thou&s;and unplea&s;ant ideas crouded into his mind with regard to him;&mdash;lord Arlington's health was &s;uch, that he might, perhaps, have &s;unk under bodily debility;&mdash; at any rate, he wanted &s;ome attention to be paid him, Francis Delaval might have been di&s;patched to Ire|land, and he him&s;elf have &s;taid to attend on his lord|&s;hip.&mdash;Again, it was po&s;&s;ible, that lord Arlington wanted to get rid of them, and, therefore, framed the &s;tory of his not being &s;afe in France, only that he might be left to him&s;elf; and this &s;u&s;picion gathered confi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mation, from his begging to decline relating his &s;tory to him. In fact, he thought, that if he had rea&s;oned properly on the &s;ubject, he might have &s;een, that lord Arlington for many rea&s;ons was by no means in a proper &s;ituation to be left without any one with him, and he wondered, that &s;uch an idea had never &s;truck him at the time; but all was then hurry and confu&s;ion; he could not, however, excu&s;e him&s;elf for &s;uch a piece of inattention.</P>
<P>Reflections, &s;uch as the&s;e, frequently pa&s;&s;ed in Mar&s;ini's mind, though he never uttered them to lady Arlington.</P>
<P>Mr. Percival, in the mean time, who had deter|mined not to give up the conte&s;t, 'till it &s;hould appear to be impo&s;&s;ible for him to maintain it any longer, &s;aw, with a &s;ecret exultation, that his opponents &s;eemed to have deluded them&s;elves with fal&s;e hopes. Every day he anxiou&s;ly watched at the port for the
<PB N="149" REF="038283_0148_10119731091082C8">
arrival of &s;hips; and every day &s;aw with a tran&s;port, which he &s;carcely attempted to di&s;&s;emble, &s;hip after &s;hip arrive, but no lord Arlington with them.</P>
<P>It was now but the day before that appointed for the trial;&mdash;mr. Percival was taking his u&s;ual &s;tand at the port, when the arrival of a ve&s;&s;el from Leghorn, was announced by three huzzas; and very &s;oon after he &s;aw two men come on &s;hore, one of them a middle aged man in appearance, and immediately enquired for the hou&s;e of count Mar&s;ini. Mr. Percival was &s;eized all over with a trembling; he did not know lord Arlington's per&s;on, but he had no doubt, that he beheld the man who&s;e pre&s;ence he &s;o much dreaded, and wi&s;hed it had then been night, that under the veil of darkne&s;s, he might have given him a pu&s;h from the boat, that &s;hould have &s;unk him be|neath the waves for ever.</P>
<P>He heard the bye-&s;tanders give the &s;trangers di|rections to find Mar&s;ini's hou&s;e, and following them at a di&s;tance, &s;aw them enter there. All day did he hover about in the environs of that &s;pot: he could hear nothing to relieve his uncertainty, nor did he retire to his own habitation till after midnight. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ere he threw him&s;elf on his bed; but &s;leep fled his eye-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s; he lay re&s;tle&s;s and unea&s;y 'till day break, when he again repaired to Mar&s;ini's hou&s;e, and &s;eeing a per&s;on come out of the hou&s;e, whom he knew to be a &s;ervant at an adjacent inn, he re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;i|ble, at once to &s;atisfy his anxious &s;oul, and enquired, therefore, of the man, 'If lord Arlington had not ar|rived at the count's hou&s;e the day before?'</P>
<P>'Who, who &s;aid the fellow?'</P>
<P>'Lord Arlington;&mdash;did he arrive at count Mar&s;ini's hou&s;e ye&s;terday?'</P>
<P>'I know nothing of their names, there was two outlandi&s;h folks came;&mdash;but if you want to know their names, I'll ax the &s;ervants.'</P>
<P>A &s;ervant then coming to the door, 'Pray if you plea&s;e,' &s;aid the fellow, 'this jontleman would be glad
<PB N="150" REF="038283_0149_10119721B11E6EB0">
to know the names of tho&s;e two out-landi&s;h lords, that came to your hou&s;e ye&s;terday.'</P>
<P>The &s;ervant, who was an Italian, replied, 'That they were count Carletti and his &s;ervant.'</P>
<P>A drop of water to the parched lips of the fainting, wounded &s;oldier, could not prove a greater cordial, than this reply did to the hara&s;&s;ed &s;oul of mr. Perci|val. He flew back to his habitation, eat his breakfa&s;t with alacrity, and then dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf for his appear|ance in court; whither he repaired at the hour ap|pointed for its meeting.</P>
<P>Not quite &s;o plea&s;ant were the feelings of lady Ar|lington, on the arrival of that hour, to which &s;he had once looked forward as the termination of her trou|bles. But that event &s;eemed now far off, nor could it be calculated, when it was likely to arrive.</P>
<P>The court, at length, met;&mdash;mr. Byrne aro&s;e, in order to &s;olicit a farther delay of the trial; but he was &s;carcely on his legs, when a confu&s;ed murmur run through the court, of, 'He is come&mdash;he is come,' and immediately appeared at the bar the &s;ame death-like emaciated figure, which Mar&s;ini had long before be|held at Sainte Marguerite.</P>
<P>He begged to be heard for a few minutes, and then &s;aid, 'That he had been detained at &s;ea more than double the u&s;ual time for the pa&s;&s;age from Bil|boa, which was the la&s;t port he left, by a leaky ve&s;&s;el and adver&s;e winds; and at la&s;t, the &s;hip, which was bound to Cork, was driven into Limerick, where &s;he had arrived two days before, having been kept above water for three former days, only by dint of ince&s;&s;ant pumping, in which every pa&s;&s;enger had been nece&s;|&s;itated to take his &s;hare. He hoped, therefore, to be indulged by the court, with an adjournment of two days; for he had left two people at Limerick, who would be important witne&s;&s;es in the cau&s;e, and who could hardly reach Dublin before the evening of the next day.'</P>
<P>The judge replied, 'That &s;uch an indulgence
<PB N="151" REF="038283_0150_101182579E58A958">
could not be refu&s;ed, when properly applied for by council.' The motion of adjournment was, there|fore, made in due form, and the court was adjourned accordingly.</P>
<P>Lord Arlington, then, reque&s;ted of mr. Byrne, to accompany him to an inn, that he might have &s;ome conver&s;ation with him on the impending bu&s;ine&s;s, and that he might have a little time to re&s;t and compo&s;e him&s;elf before his fir&s;t interview with his wife and fa|mily; 'For,' &s;aid he, 'notwith&s;tanding the fatigue I had undergone for three days before my landing, I could not &s;top at Limerick, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t got on hor&s;eback im|mediately, nor re&s;ted, 'till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rived in Dublin, when I learnt that the court was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">at moment a&s;&s;embled on my bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Mr. Byrne de&s;ired, that in&s;tead of going to an inn, lord Arlington would accompany him to his hou&s;e; to which he con&s;ented; and, as &s;oon as they arrived there, they agreed to &s;end for Mar&s;ini, (who knowing that nothing material could be done in court on that day, had not attended there) in order to impart to him the arrival of lord Arlington, that he might prepare his family to receive him.</P>
<P>Mr. Fitzpatrick, however, who was pre&s;ent when this was &s;ettled, &s;aid, 'That he would go him&s;elf to lady Arlington's hou&s;e, from whence he would di&s;|patch Mar&s;ini to mr. Byrne's, and would him&s;elf &s;tay with lady Arlington, 'till the count &s;hould return, in order to keep guard, that no intelligence of her lord's arrival, might come too abruptly upon her.'</P>
<P>Mr. Fitzpatrick, accordingly, went to lady Arling|ton's, (for by that name we &s;hall henceforth call that lady) where, as he expected, he found Mar&s;ini, and told him, he was wanted at mr. Byrne's, whither Mar|&s;ini immediately went, and mr. Fitzpatrick continued with lady Arlington, talking to her on various &s;ub|jects, 'till his return, which was in about an hour, when mr. Fitzpatrick took his leave.</P>
<P>When he was gone, Mar&s;ini &s;aid, 'At length, ma|dam,
<PB N="152" REF="038283_0151_10119602B268DC88">
I hope we are arrived at the wi&s;hed for haven, and all our troubles are at an end.'</P>
<P>'Lord!'&mdash;She could not give him time to pro|ceed, but exclaimed, 'is he arrived then?'</P>
<P>'He is, madam.'</P>
<P>It was almo&s;t too much for her;&mdash;after a &s;eparation of above fifteen years; after many weeks of anxious watching and expectation, the hu&s;band, whom &s;he &s;o much doted on, was at la&s;t in the &s;ame town with her:&mdash;&s;he gave an involuntary &s;cream of ec&s;tacy.</P>
<P>'But, why do I &s;uffer this?' &s;he cried; 'No, let me bear this too with temper, with fortitude:&mdash;But where is he?&mdash;What has detained him &s;o long?&mdash; &mdash;When &s;hall I &s;ee him?&mdash;You have &s;een him, no doubt.'</P>
<P>'Yes, I have &s;een him, indeed, madam: but, if po&s;&s;ible, he was even a more affecting &s;ight than when I &s;aw him before. He has undergone dreadful fa|tigues;&mdash;he is pale, emaciated, languid, yet he hardly &s;eems to know it. His mind has been &s;o long in a con&s;tant agitation, that he &s;eems rendered in&s;en&s;ible to bodily feelings, 'till nature is perfectly exhau&s;ted; he has had a dreadful voyage, and a hurrying journey from Limerick, by which he is, indeed, nearly ar|rived at that acm&eacute;, where nature can proceed no far|ther.</P>
<P>'When I entered the room at mr. Byrne's, he was &s;tretched on a &s;ofa, from which, however, the mo|ment he &s;aw me, he &s;prang forward, while his eyes &s;eemed to a&s;k me a thou&s;and que&s;tions at the &s;ame in&s;tant; they &s;eemed to &s;ay, tell me of my Horatia, my Antoinette, my Henry! but in a moment after he &s;unk exhau&s;ted again on the &s;ofa. I enquired, if he had taken any refre&s;hment, &s;ince his arrival, to which mr. Byrne an&s;wered, that he had been urging him to do &s;o, but had not been able to prevail&punc; I then added my entreaties to tho&s;e of mr. Byrne, which were, at la&s;t, effectual, and he &s;eemed much revived.'</P>
<P>'Alas! then,' he &s;aid, 'What can you have thought
<PB N="153" REF="038283_0152_10119608038BB700">
of my long delay?&mdash;I mu&s;t have been &s;trangely cul|pable in your eyes; but I have been unfortunate in it, not faulty.'</P>
<P>He then enquired, 'If I thought his wife would &s;ee him?'</P>
<P>'Doubt it not for a moment,' I an&s;wered; '&s;he will fly with tran&s;port into your arms.'</P>
<P>'Well, then,' he &s;aid, 'Why delay a moment? &mdash;Let us in&s;tantly ha&s;ten to her.'</P>
<P>'I begged of him not to think of &s;eeing you at this time, but to wait 'till he was refre&s;hed with re&s;t, for I really thought him too much exhau&s;ted to go through &s;uch an affecting &s;cene.'</P>
<P>'Oh! do not name re&s;t,' he cried, 'I cannot re&s;t, 'till I have &s;een her!'</P>
<P>'Well, then,' I an&s;wered, 'Follow your wi&s;hes, for every moment of delay is a moment of rapture lo&s;t to one of the be&s;t of women.</P>
<P>'We, accordingly, came hither together, and, ma|dam, he is now below, waiting my permi&s;&s;ion to come to you; and I have only kept you thus long in con|ver&s;ation, to give you both a little time to compo&s;e your&s;elves.'</P>
<P>Lady Arlington &s;carcely heard the&s;e la&s;t words&mdash; &s;he flew down &s;tairs, and in a moment found her&s;elf in the arms of her long-lo&s;t hu&s;band. Who can de&s;|cribe this &s;cene?&mdash;But it was a &s;cene not to be de&s;|cribed; it was only to be felt. They mingled tears for a while in each other's bo&s;om, which for &s;ome time were the only language which could find vent. &mdash;At la&s;t Theodore faltered out,</P>
<P>'What goodne&s;s to meet me thus!'&mdash;he loo&s;ed his hold &mdash;He &s;unk back in a chair. Lady Arlington &s;at down; &s;he took his hand affectionately;</P>
<P>'This &s;cene is too much for you I fear, my love,' &s;he &s;aid.</P>
<P>'Too much, indeed,' he replied. 'Oh! had you met me with frowns and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aidings, I could have borne it,&mdash;have knelt at you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> feet, and &s;ued for par|don;

<P>A &s;ilence again en&s;ued&mdash;then holding out his hands,</P>
<P>'Come, my children,' he &s;aid, 'You too mu&s;t &s;eal your father's pardon.'</P>
<P>They approached him;&mdash;they eagerly &s;eized the hands he extended to them;&mdash;he rai&s;ed his eyes up|wards,</P>
<P>'May heaven ble&s;s both my children!' he &s;aid, 'For ye both are indeed my ch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></P>
<P>They knelt by him&mdash;they pre&s;&s;ed his hands to their lips, and bathed them in their tears, with all the elo|quence of the mo&s;t impre&s;&s;ive &s;ilence.</P>
<P>'No, ri&s;e,' he &s;aid, 'and let me &s;old you in my arms.'</P>
<P>They aro&s;e, he embraced them tenderly.</P>
<P>'Yes!'

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>LORD Arlington aro&s;e the next morning, much recovered from his fatigues; he had enjoyed a repo&s;e, rendered doubly &s;weet by having &s;een his wife and children, and having found them in &s;uch good di&s;po|&s;itions towards him. When he entered the breakfa&s;t room, he found lady Arlington already there; &s;he met him with looks of the mo&s;t enchanting &s;weetne&s;s and tendere&s;t affection, and taking his hand, &s;aid,</P>
<P>'What plea&s;ure it gives me, my Theodore, to &s;ee you look &s;o much better! I begin, indeed, to &s;ee my hu&s;band again,&mdash;ye&s;terday I hardly knew you.'</P>
<P>'I do not wonder at it, my love,' he an&s;wered: 'Slavery, impri&s;onment, toils by &s;ea and land, eternal anxiety; the&s;e, my love, endured for fifteen years, are enough to &s;ubdue even the &s;tronge&s;t con&s;titution: but the&s;e are over now; one unhappy pa&s;&s;ion is con|quered, my heart is now wholly your's, and for the re&s;t of my life I do not doubt, but I &s;hall find that happine&s;s in being united to you, which formerly my e&s;tranged heart was unable to ta&s;te.'</P>
<P>The&s;e words were followed with &s;o tender and af|fectionate an embrace, that lady Arlington, who had never before experienced &s;uch &s;ymptoms of affection from a hu&s;band, whom &s;he doted on, lo&s;t, in that moment, all &s;en&s;e of the &s;orrows which &s;he had gone
<PB N="156" REF="038283_0155_10119611738F4F70">
through, and thought of nothing, but the happine&s;s to which &s;he tru&s;ted &s;he might now look forwards.</P>
<P>'Alas!' &s;he &s;aid, 'Have you then undergone all that variety of troubles?&mdash;Oh! How often has my anxious heart been torn with conjectures on your fate, and wi&s;hed it could &s;hare and &s;oothe your &s;orrows! &mdash;But let us not talk any more of them;&mdash;let us only now endeavour that the next fifteen years &s;hall be productive of as much happine&s;s, as the la&s;t fifteen years have of mi&s;ery.'</P>
<P>'Ah! my Horatia,' an&s;wered lord Arlington, 'We have but one path to pur&s;ue, to attain that de&s;irable end;&mdash;follow &s;incerity and rea&s;on in every thing; 'tis to deviations from them, that we owe all our unhap|pine&s;s; but I tru&s;t that we have both learnt le&s;&s;ons for our future conduct, and the cau&s;e being removed the effect will cea&s;e.'</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation continued &s;ome time, in which lord Arlington gave unbounded &s;cope to the e&s;teem and affection which he now really felt for &s;o valuable a wife as his Horatia, and, perhaps, never was a mo|ment &s;o likely to impre&s;s a man of any feeling, with an extraordinary affection for a woman;&mdash;he had de&s;erted her in a &s;trange and abrupt manner, nor had he, for more than fifteen year, ever made her the object even of his &s;malle&s;t attention; yet at his return, &s;he received him not merely without a frown, but with an overflow of tenderne&s;s, which, not to have returned, mu&s;t have &s;tamped him as a mon&s;ter, be|low the brutes.</P>
<P>At la&s;t they were joined by Henry and Antoinette. This interview opened a fre&s;h &s;cene of tenderne&s;s, which, however, in a &s;hort time was broken in upon, by the arrival of Mar&s;ini, who apologized for his in|tru&s;ion, but urged, in excu&s;e, his anxiety to hear of his friend;&mdash;but, he added afterwards,</P>
<P>'I will own that I am a little &s;elfi&s;h too in my vi&s;it; I was anxious to a&s;k a que&s;tion of lord Arlington; I would have my an&s;wer from his mouth,
<PB N="157" REF="038283_0156_10119615572BBF58">
although I anticipate in my mind what that an&s;wer will be.'</P>
<P>'I can &s;carcely refu&s;e to an&s;wer any que&s;tion put by count Mar&s;ini,' &s;aid lord Arlington.</P>
<P>'Well, then,' returned the count, 'You have al|ready declared your&s;elf the father of the lovely An|toinette: Who, then, was her mother?'</P>
<P>'Her mother,' he replied, 'was Antoinette de St. Foix, daughter to the baron de St. Foix, a French nobleman.'</P>
<P>'It is enough,' &s;aid Mar&s;ini, 'her likene&s;s to my Gabrielle is accounted for, and &s;he, I doubt not, was really faultle&s;s.'</P>
<P>'How?' &s;aid lord Arlington, 'And are you then the hu&s;band of Gabrielle de St. Foix?'</P>
<P>'It is even &s;o,' returned Mar&s;ini.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation was here put an end to, by a note from mr. Byrne, reque&s;ting lord Arlington to attend at his hou&s;e as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, to meet mr. Fitzpa|trick, in order that they might arrange the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;ucceeding day. To this note lord Arlington re|plied, by going immediately to mr. Byrne's; but at parting from his family, expre&s;&s;ed the deepe&s;t regret, that he mu&s;t leave them, probably, too, for the greate&s;t part of the day, as he anxiou&s;ly wi&s;hed to a&s;k them a thou&s;and que&s;tions, and hear from their own lips, every circum&s;tance that had happened during his ab&s;ence; for he was not half &s;atisfied with what he had learnt from Mar&s;ini, when they met in France.</P>
<P>When he was gone, Mar&s;ini bur&s;t forth into re|newed expre&s;&s;ions of affectionate attachment to An|toinette:</P>
<P>'I have called you my daughter,' &s;aid he, 'you are indeed my niece;&mdash;but be my child &s;till;&mdash;I can|not give you up;&mdash;you &s;hall have two fathers.'</P>
<P>He could not help cla&s;ping her in his arms and ki&s;&s;ing her.</P>
<P>She returned his kind expre&s;&s;ions, with like ex|pre&s;&s;ions of regard, declaring, 'That &s;he was truly
<PB N="158" REF="038283_0157_1011961851AC8170">
rejoiced to find that &s;he really could claim to be re|lated to him; though had no relation&s;hip &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, his kindne&s;s had formed a much &s;tronger claim to her regard, than any other ties could form.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the day arrived the two witne&s;&s;es from Limerick, whom lord Arlington had &s;aid, he expected;&mdash;the&s;e were Clement Seguin, and Ma|rianne de Mercier, the people who were pre&s;ent at his marriage with Antoinette, and with whom the reader will, in a &s;hort time, be better acquainted.</P>
<P>When lord Arlington was informed by mr. Byrne, of the names of the two French &s;ailors who had &s;worn to his death, he &s;aid, 'He knew them well, and knew them for a couple of complete ra&s;cals, who were corruptible to any purpo&s;e, for which they might be wanted; and he thought it probable, that they had, therefore, been corrupted to &s;wear to his death, for which &s;tory there was not the lea&s;t foun|dation, as he had not been materially ill during the whole voyage from Rochelle to St. Domingo, which i&s;land he left again, only two days after his landing. But that circum&s;tance they did not know, and, pro|bably, concluded him to be kept pri&s;oner on the i&s;land, for it was the general idea in the &s;hip, that &s;uch was to be his fate; and it was, al&s;o, probable, that the idea of his being under a confinement, from whence he was not likely to e&s;cape, had tempted them to &s;wear &s;o po&s;itively to his death.'</P>
<P>This clue being given to the council, they, on the day of trial, put &s;uch que&s;tions to them, as drew forth, at la&s;t, the following confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>'That &s;o much of their former depo&s;ition was true, as related to the manner of their becoming known to mr. Thomas Percival; but,' they now added, 'That he, in his conver&s;ations with them, often que&s;tioned them very clo&s;ely, concerning the probability of Theodore's ever e&s;caping from St. Do|mingo; and, when they con&s;tantly affirmed, (as in|deed they believed) that he never was likely to e&s;|cape,
<PB N="159" REF="038283_0158_1011961D36F03580">
he began to &s;ound them on the &s;ubject of &s;wearing to his death, offering them large rewards, if they would accompany him to Ireland, for that purpo&s;e. That, allured by the pro&s;pect of exchang|ing a life of labour, for a life of idlene&s;s, which, by their agreement with mr. Percival, they were to be enabled to do; they con&s;ented to &s;wear to whatever he &s;hould require of them. They &s;aid, al&s;o, that the paper which had been &s;worn to, as a copy from the captain's minutes, was an ab&s;olute forgery, provided only, in ca&s;e their (the two &s;ailors) evidence &s;hould be deemed in&s;ufficient; and two people from Mar&s;eilles, were hired, under the a&s;&s;umed characters of the cap|tain's mate, and &s;teward, to &s;wear to it.'</P>
<P>After this ample confe&s;&s;ion, minutes of which were taken down in writing, and which had di&s;clo&s;ed a &s;cene of villany, that would be almo&s;t incredible, were not &s;imilar in&s;tances but too frequent, the &s;ailors were conducted out of court, under a proper guard, that they might be kept from all farther intercour&s;e with the claimant, or his party, and he (the claimant) was &s;ummoned into court.</P>
<P>From the moment of lord Arlington's arrival, the &s;tate of his mind had been &s;uch, that malice it&s;elf could not have wi&s;hed him a greater torment; he &s;aw all his a&s;piring hopes at once da&s;hed to the ground, and in the fir&s;t paroxy&s;m of rage and de&s;pair, had flown to the &s;ea-&s;ide, in order, there at once to clo&s;e the &s;cene of his guilt and mi&s;ery. But when he ca&s;t his eyes over the wide extended main, his &s;oul &s;hrunk within him, at the thought of what he was about; the boundle&s;s ocean before his eyes, &s;eemed as a type of that ocean of futurity, in which he was going to plunge; he thought of the &s;hoals and quick|&s;ands he might there encounter;&mdash;his courage failed him, and he returned wild and di&s;tracted to his own apartment. He laid him&s;elf down on his pillow, but the pillow proved not the friendly coun&s;ellor, which it is generally thought to be;&mdash;no; he there medi|tated
<PB N="160" REF="038283_0159_1011961EC5F8B790">
new mi&s;chief, and determined to endeavour to prove lord Arlington an impo&s;tor.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, he had again recour&s;e to the two &s;ailors, and by fre&s;h promi&s;es, had engaged them to fre&s;h perjuries. But when the&s;e men were exa|mined, and found that matters were likely to take a turn, which their employer did not expect, like true rogues, who are never faithful to each other, they thought it better, by betraying him, to endeavour to &s;ave them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Tru&s;ting, however, to their fidelity, mr. Percival appeared in the court, with the mo&s;t unbounded con|fidence; but when the confe&s;&s;ion of the &s;ailors was read to him, his countenance, in a moment, fell;&mdash; he was taken unawares;&mdash;his pre&s;ence of mind to|tally for&s;ook him&mdash;he looked aba&s;hed, a&s;hamed, and in vain attempted to falter out a denial;&mdash;but his con|fu&s;ion &s;poke too plain;&mdash;and when he was told, 'That if he attempted to deny what the &s;ailors had advanced, they would be brought up to confront him,' he &s;aw that all was over, and, therefore, took refuge in confe&s;&s;ion. He owned, that all they had advanced, was true, and &s;aid, 'That if the court would forbear to que&s;tion him, and let him depart, he would, in pri|vate, communicate farther particulars to lord Arling|ton.'</P>
<P>The court acceded to his reque&s;t, and all things being now &s;ufficiently clear on the &s;ide of the defen|dant, the former verdict was annulled, and lord Ar|lington was re&s;tored to the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his title and e&s;tates.</P>
<P>When the court broke up, lord Arlington de&s;ired mr. Percival to follow him to mr. Byrne's hou&s;e, and when they arrived there, mr. Percival confe&s;&s;ed, that from the moment when he fir&s;t heard of his (lord Ar|lington's) &s;trange departure, which he did by means of a corre&s;pondent at Limerick, whom he made a &s;ort of &s;py on the family, he conceived hopes, though he hardly knew why, that it was a circum&s;tance, which
<PB N="161" REF="038283_0160_101196230216AB00">
might one day turn out to his advantage; and he had, therefore, ever &s;ince kept continually on the watch, for any thing that might tend to feed the&s;e hopes.</P>
<P>The paper offered him by Pierre Dupont, he con|ceived might be of u&s;e to forward his views; and he, therefore, re&s;olved to purcha&s;e it at any rate: year after year, however, elap&s;ed, and he gained no ground; yet he carefully kept the paper, as the golden ear from which he one day hoped to reap a plentiful har|ve&s;t. He heard from his corre&s;pondent at Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erick regularly, five or &s;ix times a year, and knew from him every occurrence that happened in lord Arling|ton's family.</P>
<P>At length, the two &s;ailors arrived at Mar&s;eilles, and from the fir&s;t moment when he heard their &s;tory, he was continually plotting how he might u&s;e it to his own advantage. The death of Theodore without lawful heirs, would &s;ecure to him the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of rank and fortune, and he therefore turned his whole attention to the be&s;t method of procuring his death, and the illegitimacy of his &s;on; and for effecting this purpo&s;e, he had followed the plan which had ulti|mately tended to lay open the whole &s;cene of his vil|lany. He concluded his confe&s;&s;ion, by throwing him&s;elf at the feet of lord Arlington, and earne&s;tly begging his forgivene&s;s, u&s;ing the &s;tronge&s;t expre&s;|&s;ions of contrition for his pa&s;t conduct, and promi&s;es of reformation for the future.</P>
<P>Lord Arlington a&s;&s;ured him, that he bore ma|lice again&s;t him; that he pitied his errors, and would be glad to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in carrying his good re&s;olutions into effect. He told him to come to him the next morning, when he would have &s;ome farther conver|&s;ation with him, and then departed to his family, where mutual congratulations pa&s;&s;ed on the preceding events;&mdash;all care, all &s;orrow, &s;eemed now bani&s;hed from among&s;t them, and they &s;at down to dinner, which was received by lady Arlington, with a r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">li&s;h
<PB N="162" REF="038283_0161_10119624F6B82208">
that &s;he had not known for many years, in having her hu&s;band at the table with her.</P>
<P>After dinner, at which Mar&s;ini, his friend count Carletti, who&s;e arrival has been already mentioned, Clement and Marianne, were gue&s;ts, lord Arlington, with an apology to tho&s;e gue&s;ts, for making them&s;elves the principal objects of the company, begged of lady Arlington to gratify him, by telling him all that had pa&s;&s;ed in his ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>'The outline of the &s;tory, it is true, I already <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">now,' &s;aid he, 'my Horatia; it remains for you to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dd all the little touches, which mu&s;t make it a fi|ni&s;hed piece.'</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHILE I was ab&s;ent on my travels, and during the time that I was detained at Vienne, by the illne&s;s and death of my worthy and re&s;pected tutor, mr. Lew&s;on, I became acquainted with the baron de St. Foix, who had a very fine chateau near Vienne. The baron was one of the true French noble&s;&s;e, haughty, arrogant, &s;upercilious; full of his own greatne&s;s, and of the antiquity of his family, and devoted to whatever he con&s;idered as tending to the aggran|dizement of that family, of which he was &s;o proud. His father had been for &s;ome years re&s;ident in Eng|land, while the baron was quite young, where the
<PB N="164" REF="038283_0163_1011962B8F4FB550">
latter learnt the Engli&s;h language &s;o completely, that he could &s;peak it as well as the French, and where, al&s;o, he contracted a partiality (as far as he ever con|tracted a partiality for any thing, but him&s;elf) to the Engli&s;h nation, which led him to treat all &s;ubjects of the Briti&s;h empire, who could claim the rank of gen|tlemen, with an affability and attention which he rarely conde&s;cended to &s;hew, even to his equals in his own country.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of this conde&s;cen&s;ion in the baron, I was admitted freely as a gue&s;t at his hou&s;e; and, indeed, my &s;ituation at that time &s;eemed even to have touched him with a kind of compa&s;&s;ion, &s;o as to make him wi&s;h to contribute, as far as was con&s;i&s;tent with his dignity, to my comfort, in my then afflicting cir|cum&s;tances. He gave me free leave to walk in his grounds, whenever I was inclined; and even permitted me to have a key of a gate to his park, which was clo&s;e by the city of Vienne, and by means of which I had a much readier acce&s;s to his hou&s;e, and grounds, than by the common road.</P>
<P>His famil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, at that time, con&s;i&s;ted only of him&s;elf, a &s;on, and a daughter. The &s;on was in Italy, with, I &s;uppo&s;e, count Mar&s;ini, and was, as I under&s;tood, a mo&s;t amiable and accompli&s;hed gentleman. The daughter, the charming mademoi&s;elle de St. Foix, need I &s;ay more of her, than that &s;he was then, in every re&s;pect, what Antoinette is now, both in per&s;on, face and mind?</P>
<P>To a &s;oul &s;o full of &s;en&s;ibility as her's, my &s;ituation &s;oon became very intere&s;ting; I was on the point of lo&s;ing a friend, to whom I was under the greate&s;t ob|ligations, and whom I truly loved and e&s;teemed.&mdash;I &s;aw him daily &s;ink under the pre&s;&s;ure of accumulated ills; and, being far from all my friends, and in a country to the manners and cu&s;toms of which I was nearly a &s;tranger, &s;uch a lo&s;s would be much more &s;everely felt.</P>
<P>She always, therefore, &s;eemed to endeavour to be particularly animated in my company, in order to di&s;|&s;ipate,
<PB N="165" REF="038283_0164_1011962D361FD1D8">
as far as was in her power, the melancholy, which I could not conceal; and her attentions were too plea&s;ing to pa&s;s unnoticed by me.</P>
<P>Sometimes, when &s;he &s;aw me taking a &s;olitary walk in the garden, &s;he would join me, and by the bril|liancy of her conver&s;ation, cha&s;e from my thoughts, for a while, the &s;ubject that di&s;tre&s;&s;ed me.</P>
<P>Ah! fatal attentions to my peace!&mdash;while &s;he &s;trove to drive one unea&s;ine&s;s from my bo&s;om, &s;he paved the way for the introduction of a thou&s;and others. In &s;hort, I had not long been acquainted with her, before I loved her to di&s;traction; and having &s;ome rea&s;on to hope, that I was not quite indifferent to her, I was revolving in my mind how I might lay open my heart to her, when a blow fell on us, which at once cru&s;hed our ri&s;ing hopes, and which, at la&s;t, terminated in the death of Antoinette, and in my own wor&s;e than death, in the total overthrow of my hap|pine&s;s for a long &s;eries of years.</P>
<P>A corre&s;pondence had been for &s;ome time carrying on between the baron de St. Foix, and the marquis de Lamoignon, a nobleman no le&s;s proud and arrogant, than the baron him&s;elf.</P>
<P>One day the baron called Antoinette into his room, and told her, 'That he had a glorious piece of new<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to impart to her; that he had ju&s;t agreed on a match between her, and the count de St. Pol, &s;on to the mar|quis de Lamoignon;&mdash;that the count would be at his chateau that very afternooon, and that &s;he mu&s;t pre|pare her&s;elf to receive him as her lover and future hu&s;band. You will &s;ee, my dear Antoinette,' he added, 'how much I have con&s;ulted your intere&s;t, and happine&s;s alone in this match, &s;ince I have engaged to give you a very large dower, in con&s;ideration of the &s;on of a marquis conde&s;cending to unite him&s;elf to the daughter of a baron only; not but my family is more ancient than the marquis's: but deference is certainly due to rank like his.'</P>
<P>The a&s;toni&s;hed Antoinette, who had not, 'till that
<PB N="166" REF="038283_0165_101196303021FDB0">
moment, the lea&s;t idea of what was going on, lo&s;t, by &s;o &s;udden and unexpected a &s;hock, all power of &s;peech. Indeed, &s;he knew too well, her father's imperious and violent temper, to have dared to make any direct op|po&s;ition to him, unle&s;s driven to it by the &s;tronge&s;t nece&s;&s;ity; and &s;he thought the be&s;t way was, to ac|quie&s;ce in &s;ilence, that &s;he might gain time to con&s;ider how &s;he could be&s;t counteract a de&s;ign, again&s;t which her heart revolted. Not that at that time &s;he was ac|quainted with the count de St. Pol, for even his per|&s;on was unknown to her; but his character was by no means &s;uch, as could make her think an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> union with him de&s;irable;&mdash;added to which, there was &s;ome|thing perfectly revolting in being thus bargained for, not only without her con&s;ent, but even without her knowledge;&mdash;and, perhaps, more than all, if I may &s;ay &s;o, without vanity, her heart was too partial to me, to endure the thoughts of marrying another. She made no reply, therefore, to the baron, but with|drew to give vent to the emotions of her bo&s;om, in a retired part of the garden.</P>
<P>I was then availing my&s;elf of the baron's permi&s;&s;ion to re&s;ort to his gardens at any time, and was walking in the very part, whither Antoinette had turned her &s;teps. She did not, however, perceive me, and I &s;aw her &s;it down on a bench, d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">owned in tears. This was a moment which I could not re&s;i&s;t; I approached the &s;eat; &s;he &s;carcely &s;eemed to attend to me; I &s;at down by her:</P>
<P>'Alas!' &s;aid I, 'What can thus afflict the charm|ing mademoi&s;elle de St. Foix? A &s;oul like her's &s;hould &s;urely be exempt from &s;orrow.'</P>
<P>'Oh! &s;ir,' &s;he replied, ''tis the cur&s;e of our &s;ex, that we are never to know what happine&s;s is. Man may &s;ometimes be free, but woman, unhappy woman, is eternally a &s;lave to &s;ome tyrant or other; man is &s;ometimes allowed his choice in a partner in the mar|riage tie; but woman mu&s;t &s;ubmit to be &s;old to the fir&s;t per&s;on who thinks her worth the purcha&s;e.'</P>
<P>'Cur&s;es light on the heart that could be &s;o har|dened,

as to think of holding up to &s;ale &s;uch a trea|&s;ure as Antoinette!' &s;aid I, boiling with indignation.</P>
<P>'Oh! hold,' &s;he &s;aid, 'Cur&s;e him not, for &s;till he is my father, and much is due to that &s;acred charac|ter, though he may abu&s;e his power;&mdash;I would re&s;i&s;t his tyranny, but cannot bear to &s;it by and hear him cur&s;ed.'</P>
<P>'Pardon my ra&s;h and ha&s;ty tongue,' I replied, 'I acknowledge my fault, and the ju&s;tice of your re|proof; but, Oh! deare&s;t Antoinette, &s;urely my eyes have not been &s;uch unfaithful interpreters of my heart, as to leave you any room to doubt, that that heart is wholly, &s;olely your's. Tell me, then; can I do aught to re&s;cue you from your pre&s;ent embar|ra&s;&s;ment? I cannot know a joy equal to &s;erving you; &mdash;&s;peak, lovely creature! &mdash;I have &s;ometimes been pre&s;umptuous enough to hope, that I was not quite indifferent to you.'</P>
<P>She looked earne&s;tly at me, and after a &s;ilence of a minute or two, &s;aid,</P>
<P>'I know not whether you may not deem me too forward in the confe&s;&s;ion I am going to make; but circum&s;tance, powerful circum&s;tance, demands, that I &s;hould be explicit;&mdash;Yes, mr. Percival, I will own, that I have &s;een your partiality for me&mdash;&s;een it with a plea&s;ure, which I will not attempt to di&s;&s;emble, and have been induced to think, that the greate&s;t happine&s;s I could know, was to &s;pend the remainder of my days with you. Judge, then, what my feelings mu&s;t be, at receiving a po&s;itive command from my father, to receive the count de St. Pol, as my lover and future hu&s;band;&mdash;a man, whom I never even &s;aw, and who&s;e pride and arrogance are the theme of univer&s;al dete&s;tation, by all who are not as proud and arrogant as him&s;elf. And this marriage has been agreed upon by my father, without his ever having even mentioned the &s;ubject to me. What can I do? Mi&s;ery mu&s;t await my refu&s;al of this dete&s;ted marriage; and mi|&s;ery mu&s;t, in all probability, await my con&s;ent to it;

but that I am determined never to do. If I mu&s;t be mi&s;erable, at lea&s;t I will not have to reproach my&s;elf as the author of my own wretchedne&s;s.'</P>
<P>It is not nece&s;&s;ary to detail at large the particulars of this interview; it is &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that it became at la&s;t &s;o intere&s;ting to us, that we exchanged reci|procal promi&s;es of unalterable fidelity to each other. and that we would pre&s;erve that faith at all hazards. She &s;aid, '&s;he mu&s;t &s;ee St. Pol that afternoon, for a refu&s;al to do &s;o, would be a fooli&s;h irritation of her father, which could &s;erve no good purpo&s;e; but was determined not to give him any encouragement:' and when we parted, &s;he appointed me to to meet her at the &s;ame &s;pot early the next morning, that &s;he might tell me how matters were going on.</P>
<P>Accordingly, we met the next morning, when &s;he told me, 'That her interview with St. Pol had only confirmed her re&s;olution, never to be his; for &s;he found, that the world had not done him inju&s;tice in the character it had given him. He was in&s;olent be|yond conception, and in that fir&s;t interview, had treated her with all the arrogance and contempt, which are too often &s;hewn by the hu&s;band to his wife: but are &s;eldom practi&s;ed by the lover to his mi&s;tre&s;s.' She then proceeded to &s;ay, 'When the count left us, a mo&s;t painful &s;cene indeed en&s;ued, be|tween my father and me, in which I very plainly told him, that I could never think of giving my hand to a man, who could not behave with decent civility to me, even at our fir&s;t meeting; and after the &s;pecimen of his behaviour, which he had ju&s;t been giving me, I &s;aw very plainly what I had to expect, when the mar|riage tie &s;hould have given him a legal right to tyran|nize over me: that, in &s;hort, rather than give my hand to a man, &s;o de&s;titute as St. Pol, of every quality of mind, on which to form any rational hopes of happi|ne&s;s, I would take refuge in the even le&s;s i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k&s;ome fet|ters of a cloi&s;ter.</P>
<P>'I cannot de&s;cribe my father's rage,' &s;he conti|nued,
<PB N="169" REF="038283_0168_1011963AC9A39720">
'when he heard me utter the&s;e &s;entiments, in a tone &s;o firm and decided, as could leave him no ex|pectation of my re&s;olution being &s;haken: he &s;tamped on the ground, and foaming at the mouth, was ren|dered, by pa&s;&s;ion, incapable of utterance; and I know not to what lengths his ungovernable temper might have carried him, had not a dome&s;tic fortunately en|tered at that moment, and informed him, that a me&s;|&s;enger was arrived at the chateau, with di&s;patches from the court.

No &s;uch &s;ummons, however, has arrived, nor have I &s;een or heard of my father &s;ince.'</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed an hour in &s;weet, but melancholy con|ver&s;ation, when Antoinette &s;aid, 'That &s;he mu&s;t leave me, for &s;he dared not &s;tay any longer;' and we parted with renewed prote&s;tations of fidelity to each other; Antoinette promi&s;ing, 'that I &s;hould hear from her, when &s;he had any tidings to communicate,' and begging, at the &s;ame time, 'that I would not attempt to &s;ee her 'till I had heard from her.'</P>
<P>She then turned her &s;teps towards the hou&s;e, and I returned to my hotel at Vienne, to the melancholy ta&s;k of attending my poor friend, who&s;e health I &s;aw every day declining more and more rapidly, and to whom, on that account only, I never imparted my affair with Antoinette, which otherwi&s;e, I &s;hould not have thought of concealing from him.</P>
<P>For five days I lived on the rack of expectation; but did not hear a word of my adored Antoinette. At la&s;t, a confu&s;ed rumour reached my ears, by means of the phy&s;ician who attended mr. Lew&s;on, that &s;he had been carried away by order of the baron, and no one knew what was become of her. What horrible images did this report rai&s;e in my bo&s;om? I pictured to my&s;elf the object of my ardent affection, betrayed by the very per&s;on, who ought to have protected her

from all outrage, into the arms of a man &s;he dete&s;ted; for I concluded nothing el&s;e, but that the baron had forced her into the power of St. Pol.</P>
<P>I flew in an agony to the chateau, where the fir&s;t per&s;on I met with, was an old female &s;ervant, wife to the porter of the chateau, who had known An|toinette from her childhood, and loved her as well as &s;he loved her own daughter. I a&s;ked, with trembling anxiety, 'If her young mi&s;tre&s;s had left the chateau?'</P>
<P>'Oh! yes, &s;ir,' &s;he replied, and bur&s;t into tears: 'She has, indeed, and we none of us know what is become of her!'</P>
<P>'What is it you tell me?' I cried, 'You do not know what is become of her?'</P>
<P>'Alas! No, &s;ir,' &s;aid &s;he, 'It is now five days ago, &s;ince the baron and &s;he had a very great quarrel; after which he ordered the coach to be got ready, and made my young lady get into it with him, and he returned a few hours after in the coach by him|&s;elf, and the next morning he and all his &s;ervants went away to Paris, and that is all I know about the matter, &s;ir.'</P>
<P>For me&mdash;I cannot de&s;cribe my feelings at this ac|count of the old woman's.&mdash;Excu&s;e me, my Horatia, my deare&s;t wife, 'tis a remembrance, that gives me &s;uch agony.

<P>I enquired of the old woman, 'If &s;he could tell me which way the coach went?'</P>
<P>'She knew not what road it took,' &s;he &s;aid, 'after it got out of the park, and the coachman who drove it was gone to Paris with the baron.'</P>
<P>I then thanked the old woman for the information &s;he had given me, and went to enquire in the neighbourhood, if they could give me any intelligence of the route the coach had taken, that I might trace

out, if po&s;&s;ible, what was become of my deare&s;t An|toinette. After much enquiry, I at la&s;t learnt &s;o far, as that the coach pa&s;&s;ed a hou&s;e about five miles from Vienne; and there I &s;topped my enquiries for that day, as I had been longer than u&s;ual ab&s;ent from my friend, whom, notwith&s;tanding all my anxieties on another &s;ubject, I could not bear the idea of appear|ing to neglect.</P>
<P>At my return to the hotel, I found that he had &s;uch &s;o much in the la&s;t &s;ix hours, that it was very improbable he &s;hould live the night through; and my fears were right: he expired before the morning, to my un&s;peakable regret, for in him I lo&s;t &s;uch a friend, as I could &s;carcely hope ever to have again. Never, &s;urely, was a man &s;o well calculated to execute, with propriety, the office of travelling tutor, which he had undertaken, and I can only wi&s;h my Henry the exact counterpart of mr. Lew&s;on, if ever he &s;hall &s;et out on the plan that I did. But I forbear to dwell farther on his virtues and my lo&s;s; my letters always bore honourable te&s;timony to his worth, and my obliga|tions; and, perhaps, I lo&s;t him at the mo&s;t critical moment that &s;uch a lo&s;s could be &s;u&s;tained, for had he lived, prudent council might have a&s;&s;i&s;ted me in winding my way more judiciou&s;ly out of the labyrinth in which I was involved.</P>
<P>The next morning, after I had given &s;uch orders as were nece&s;&s;ary, in con&s;equence of the melancholy event which had ju&s;t taken place, I &s;et out again on my pur&s;uit of my lo&s;t Antoinette, and, by dint of un|remitted enquiries, at la&s;t traced her to the convent of Sainte Marguerite, fourteen miles from Vienne. Thus was I well a&s;&s;ured of the &s;ituation of my beloved, and was even comforted to find her only &s;hut up in a convent, after having pictured her to my&s;elf in the &s;o much more dreadful &s;ituation of the legal pro&s;ti|tute of St. Pol. But, how was it po&s;&s;ible to arrive at any intercour&s;e with her?&mdash;Supinene&s;s and inactivity, however, I was well a&s;&s;ured, could do nothing for

me;&mdash;exertion of mind was the only thing likely to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in my pre&s;ent &s;ituation; and I was re&s;olved, that as &s;oon as I had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">id the la&s;t &s;ad duties to poor Lew&s;on, I would take up my ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">de in the neighbour|hood of the convent, that I might be in the way to watch opportunity, and to act immediately on any emergency.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, I &s;ecured a lodging at an inn, only a mile from the convent, and which was the neare&s;t place that I could po&s;&s;ibly get one at; and, as &s;oon as I had &s;een my friend depo&s;ited in the peaceful grave, and &s;ettled all his, and my own concerns, at Vienne, I returned to my inn, and there took up my abode.</P>
<P>I had not been &s;ettled there more than two days, when I became acquainted with this good man (pointing to Clement, who &s;at on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the room) then a friar, and who was the intimate friend of father An&s;elm, the confe&s;&s;or of the convent. After &s;ome few conver&s;ations with him, and getting what in&s;ight I could into his character, which I found was that of one of the mo&s;t hone&s;t and benevolent of men; I thought I might venture to tru&s;t him &s;o far, as to tell him I had rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that a young lady, to whom my heart was entirely devoted, had been hurried by her father into the convent a &s;hort time before, and I entreated him, if po&s;&s;ible, to learn, whether any one had lately been lodged there, who might an&s;wer to this de&s;cription.</P>
<P>He readily engaged to make the enquiries I wi&s;hed, and &s;aid, 'That he did not doubt but by means of An&s;elm, he could gain me the information I de&s;ired; expre&s;&s;ing, at the &s;ame time, (as though forgetting, for a moment, through benevolent feelings, that he was a friar) the greate&s;t abhorrence of that barbarity exerci&s;ed by parents &s;o frequently, in throwing off young and helple&s;s females, whom they were bound to protect, not to per&s;ecute, into a &s;ituation, which mu&s;t preclude her from all po&s;&s;ibility of enjoying real

happine&s;s; &s;entiments which did honour to his head and heart, and which long experience has abundantly te&s;tified to me, were not the flim&s;y cant of the mo|ment, but the &s;ettled principles of his &s;oul.</P>
<P>On the morrow, I had another vi&s;it from my friend Clement, who told me, 'He had made the enquiries I de&s;ired of his brother An&s;elm, and had heard from him, that a young woman of con&s;ummate beauty, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a firmne&s;s and loftine&s;s of &s;oul, beyond what is to be found in the generality of her own &s;ex, and in very many of the other, was brought there about ten or twelves days before. That &s;he &s;eemed in deep affliction, but in&s;tead of u&s;ele&s;sly yielding to, and drooping under it, &s;he exerted all her re&s;olution to &s;u&s;tain her&s;elf with dignity and fortitude. That &s;he was watched with more than u&s;ual &s;trictne&s;s; one of the &s;uperiors (&s;i&s;ter Marianne) having orders never to leave her; that &s;he was never &s;uffered to appear at the grate; and that it was under&s;tood in the convent, that as &s;oon as her year of noviciate was expired, &s;he was to take the veil.'</P>
<P>So far fortune &s;eemed to have favoured me in my re&s;earches. I now ventured to proceed farther, and to &s;ound Clement, Whether I might not, by means of An&s;elm, get a letter conveyed to my unfortunate Antoinette. He undertook this bu&s;ine&s;s too, as readily as he had undertaken the other, at the &s;ame time giving me the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urances, that I might depend on both his own, and An&s;elm's &s;e|cre&s;y.</P>
<P>I accordingly wrote to Antoinette, informing her where I was, and by what means I had come to the knowledge of her &s;ituation, and obtained the means of communication with her, entreating her, if po&s;&s;ible, to write to me, and let me know all that had befallen her &s;ince our la&s;t meeting.</P>
<P>This letter I gave to Clement, who immediately re|paired to the convent, and returned to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n a few hours, telling me that he had given it to An&s;elm,

who would take the fir&s;t &s;afe opportunity of conveying it into the hands of Antoinette.</P>
<P>Clement &s;pent the re&s;t of the day with me, and every time I &s;aw him, I became more and more plea&s;ed with his company and conver&s;ation. I have always found him &s;en&s;ible, liberal, and well-informed, open and ingenuous, not cunning and crafty, like mo&s;t of his order.</P>
<P>'Excu&s;e me, &s;ir,' &s;aid lord Arlington, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to Clement, 'I mu&s;t pay you the tribute you de&s;erve.'</P>
<P>The two &s;ucceeding days pa&s;&s;ed over, without &s;ee|ing Clement; and I began rather to wonder at his long delay: but on the morning of the third, he came to me, and &s;aid,</P>
<P>'That he had ju&s;t parted from An&s;elm, and learnt from him, that he had given the letter to Antoinette, who received it with tran&s;port, but that it was im|po&s;&s;ible &s;he &s;hould an&s;wer it; &s;he could only &s;end through him a&s;&s;urances of her love and fidelity.&mdash;But &s;ir,' &s;aid Clement, 'An&s;elm bade me a&s;k you, if yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> dare &s;hew your love to your mi&s;tre&s;s, by running &s;ome hazard to procure an interview with her?'</P>
<P>'Hazard!' I exclaimed, 'Is there any danger, that I would not brave to &s;ee her?'</P>
<P>'Well, then,' &s;aid Clement, 'I will procure a friar's habit for you, and in that dre&s;s you &s;hall ac|company me to-morrow morning to the convent.'</P>
<P>Clement then appointed me a place of meeting, whither I eagerly repaired the next morning, and &s;ound him waiting for me. I arrayed my&s;elf in my di&s;gui&s;e, and we &s;et forward to the convent, where we arrived without any interruption, and went imme|diately to An&s;elm's cell.</P>

<P>NEVER was I &s;o much impre&s;&s;ed with the fight of any one, as when I fir&s;t ca&s;t my eyes on father An|&s;elm. His countenance was the perfect picture of &s;orrow, re&s;ignation, and benevolence. He &s;eemed to be of a very advanced age, but his eyes &s;till full of animation, and he was perfectly upright. His whole appearance, in &s;hort, &s;pake the remnant of manly beauty, both in face and per&s;on. On my entering, he acco&s;ted me with a benedicite, uttered in the mo&s;t emphatic tone, and then &s;aid to me, </P>
<P>'Young man, you behold before you one, who was in his youth the devoted victim of parental per|&s;ecution, as I fear, alas! is too often the ca&s;e with &s;uch as are engaged in the life, to which I have been for &s;o many years devoted. We are &s;ome of us com|pelled by our parents, to take upon us the religious vow; and others take refuge in it, when deprived, by per&s;ecution, of all worldly happine&s;s. I was one of the latter de&s;cription; &mdash;I loved, and was beloved again, but my Adeline was torn from my arms, by a cruel father, who thought her beneath me, nor know I, to this moment, whither he conveyed her.</P>
<P>In de&s;pair I re&s;olved to for&s;ake the world, and

I thought, that when I was deprived of thee, no earthly object could ever intere&s;t my &s;oul, and I &s;ought therefore to fill it wholly with heavenly ones.&mdash;But, it will not do; &s;olitude has but fed a pa&s;&s;ion that de|vours me; and while I have &s;eemed devoted to my God, I have been devoted to my Adeline.'</P>

<P>'Then, Oh! my &s;on, if thy pa&s;&s;ion &s;hould end as unfortunately as mine did, do not follow the cour&s;e I have done, but &s;eek, by reading and reflection, and, above all, by leading an active life, to mitigate your &s;orrows. But, hark! I hear the &s;teps of &s;ome one! &mdash;'Tis your mi&s;tre&s;s, I doubt not; &s;he comes this morning to confe&s;&s;ion.'</P>
<P>A gentle t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p at the door confirmed him in the truth of his conjectures; he opened it, and in a moment I cla&s;ped my beloved Antoinette in my arms.</P>
<P>An&s;elm then conducted us into a clo&s;et adjoining to his cell, which belonged to him, where we could conver&s;e freely, without fear of interruption. She then related to me all that had happened &s;ince our la&s;t interview, in the following words:</P>
<P>'When I was returning to my chamber, after I had parted from you, I met my father on the &s;tairs leading to it; at &s;ight of him, I was ready to &s;ink into the earth; he &s;ternly a&s;ked me, where I had been, and, how I had dared to &s;tir from my room without his permi&s;&s;ion?&mdash;I replied, that I had been in the garden:&mdash;he took me by the arm, pulled me forcibly into my room, and then &s;aid,</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="038283_0176_101196541FB48038">'I have found you out, madam; this reluctance to wed the man, whom I had cho&s;en for you, I find ari&s;es from the ba&s;e&s;t motives.&mdash;Oh! could I have &s;uppo&s;ed that the daughter of the baron de St. Foix, could ever have harboured &s;uch grovelling ideas,&mdash;I would have &s;een that ra&s;cally Iri&s;hman hurled to the bottom of the ocean, before he &s;hould have been per|mitted to enter my doors.'</P>
<P>'I &s;aw plainly by this harangue,' continued An+toinette, 'that my father had really di&s;covered our attachment, and wondered much by what means it had come to his knowledge; though, as I afterwards learnt, he had gained his information from one of the &s;ervants, who had watched us, and overheard &s;ome of our conver&s;ation that morning, unob&s;erved by us.</P>
<P>'My father then bur&s;t into a torrent of the mo&s;t violent invective again&s;t you, and again&s;t me; and at la&s;t &s;aid,</P>
<P>'But I am re&s;olved, madam: and you &s;hall find, that I can be as ob&s;tinate as your&s;elf; either you &s;hall &s;wear to me this moment to give your hand, at the time I &s;hall name, to the count de St. Pol, or this in|&s;tant you &s;hall be carried to a cloi&s;ter, from whence, mark my words, it is my fixed, my unalterable deter|mination, you &s;hall never come out alive.'</P>
<P>'He then took up a Bible, which lay on the table, and coming up to me, attempted to put it into my hands. I &s;hrunk back: I entreated him to pau&s;e, and reflect on what he was about;&mdash;that it gave me pain ever to be obliged to conte&s;t any point with him, but that I never would con&s;ent to be the wife of St. Pol, who was not merely an object of indifference to me, but the object of my thorough contempt and aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>'I begged him only to allow him&s;elf a few days to reflect on this affair, when I could not but hope he would view it in a different light. That with regard to your&s;elf, though I did not know by what means he had di&s;covered my attachment to you, yet I certainly &s;hould not di&s;avow it, as I thought it a pa&s;&s;ion rather
<PB N="178" REF="038283_0177_10119656E3C24818">
to glory in, than to be a&s;hamed of. That I could not under&s;tand what he meant, by calling it a ba&s;e pa&s;|&s;ion; that you were of an illu&s;trious family in your own country; and that he had him&s;elf often acknow|ledged, with the warme&s;t encomiums, that your per|&s;onal and mental accompli&s;hments were almo&s;t une|qualled.</P>
<P>'He &s;eemed to he&s;itate.&mdash;I threw my&s;elf on my knees, and taking one of his hands, which I pre&s;&s;ed to my bo&s;om, entreated only three days delay, be|fore he proceeded any farther in this affair.&mdash; I con|jured him to con&s;ider the dreadful con&s;equences that might en&s;ue from hurrying matters on;&mdash; that he would not only, by that means, endanger the total de|&s;truction of my peace of mind, but would, perhaps, lay up for him&s;elf a &s;tore of mi&s;ery for the remainder of his days; &mdash; mi&s;ery which he could not avoid feel|ing, if ever reflection &s;hould come acro&s;s his mind; &mdash;and he &s;hould con&s;ider, that in&s;tead of being the protector of his daughter, he had been her tyrant, perhaps her murderer.'</P>
<P>(Tears here &s;tole down the cheeks of the young Antoinette; &s;he called to mind the death of the her|mit of Killarney, and &s;u&s;picions aro&s;e in her mind, that her mother's words had been prophetic of the fate of the baron. She gave an expre&s;&s;ive look at lady Arlington, who &s;eemed to enter into what was pa&s;&s;ing in her mind, and nodded her a&s;&s;ent to it. Lord Arlington ob&s;erved them: 'Yes, doubtle&s;s,' he &s;aid, 'it will hereafter appear, that the words of thy mother, my deare&s;t child, were prophetic;' and then he proceeded in his narration.)</P>
<P>My Antoinette continued her &s;tory thus: 'For a moment my father &s;eemed deeply impre&s;&s;ed with what I &s;aid; but then ha&s;tily &s;natching away his hand:'</P>
<P>'No,' he &s;aid, 'my honour is engaged to St. Pol, and cannot be recalled;&mdash;delay is impo&s;&s;ible;&mdash;I am &s;ummoned to court;&mdash;I mu&s;t &s;et out for Paris to-mor|row;

&mdash;either this moment then repeat the oath, which I &s;hall dictate, or a cloi&s;ter &s;hall receive you; from which, I repeat my words again, you never &s;hall come out alive.'</P>
<P>'Seeing him thus determined, and that neither arguments nor entreaties could more him, I found nothing remained for me, but to be equally decided. Well then, &s;ir,' I an&s;wered, 'Since &s;uch is your cruel determination, hear mine;&mdash;You may make me mi&s;erable, but my own lips &s;hall never &s;eal my mi&s;ery, by con&s;enting to a pro&s;titution which my &s;oul abhors; &mdash;I am re&s;olved never to be the wife of St. Pol.</P>
<P>'Never &s;hall I forget the look which my father gave me;&mdash;it was a mixture of unutterable rage and a&s;toni&s;hment;&mdash;of a&s;toni&s;hment, to find &s;uch re&s;o|lution in a female bo&s;om;&mdash;and of rage, at finding him&s;elf thus thwarted in his favourite plan of aggran|dizing his family, for &s;o he con&s;idered the mi&s;ery to which he would have doomed me.</P>
<P>'He bur&s;t from me, opened the door, then violently clapped it to again; &mdash; looked &s;ternly at me:'</P>
<P>'And are you thus re&s;olved?' he &s;aid, 'But take care, for if you now let me quit your appartment, without taking the oath which I demand, the world united cannot &s;ave you from my ju&s;t indignation.'.</P>
<P>'I went up to him, took his hand, and was going to ki&s;s it, but he &s;purned me from him.'</P>
<P>'I will not be thus fooled,' he &s;aid, 'Take the oath this moment, or I am gone, and then&mdash;'</P>
<P>'He pau&s;ed, and looked for my reply.</P>
<P>'I cannot, dare not, perjure my&s;elf:&mdash;Can my father wi&s;h that I &s;hould?'</P>
<P>'You will not take the oath then?'</P>
<P>'I can never yield to be the wife of St. Pol;&mdash;Yet hear me, oh! my father!</P>
<P>'I caught hold of his coat; he flung me from him, &s;o that I fell on the floor; he then bur&s;t open the door, went furiou&s;ly out of the room, and locked it after him.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="038283_0179_1011965DE883C7C8">'I lay for &s;ome minutes on the floor, almo&s;t with|out &s;en&s;e or recollection; &s;tunned &s;carcely le&s;s by the ferocity of my father, than by my fall. But the more I recollected my&s;elf, the more I was convinced of the folly I &s;hould be guilty of, were I to give way to de&s;pondency, at an hour which called for the mo&s;t ac|tive exertion: that it was my duty, as well as my in|tere&s;t, not weakly to &s;ink under my troubles, but to endeavour to combat them; and that though others might oppre&s;s my body, my mind could never be conquered without my own con&s;ent.</P>
<P>'With the&s;e reflections I fortified my &s;oul again&s;t the &s;torm, which I &s;aw approaching, and ri&s;ing from the floor, began to arrange my concerns for a fate which &s;eemed inevitable.</P>
<P>'In about half an hour my father returned to me, attended by two of the &s;ervants.'</P>
<P>'Take her,' he &s;aid to them, 'and carry her to the coach.'</P>
<P>'It is unnece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e force,' I &s;aid, 'I &s;hall make no re&s;i&s;tance.&mdash; I walked down &s;tairs with com|po&s;ure, and &s;eated my&s;elf in the coach, into which my father al&s;o got, and we drove hither. Not a word pa&s;&s;ed between us on the way;&mdash;my father &s;eemed much agitated, but he never once looked at me.</P>
<P>'When we arrived here, we were immediately &s;hewn into the parlour, which we found empty. My father then looked full in my face, for the fir&s;t time &s;ince our leaving the cheateau, and taking me by the hand.'</P>
<P>'Antoinette,' &s;aid he, ''Tis not yet too late; but this moment mu&s;t &s;eal your doom;&mdash;the oath;&mdash;you may &s;till &s;ave your&s;elf.'</P>
<P>'Not at that price;&mdash;Would my father have me &s;eal my own damnation?'</P>
<P>'Oh! invincible ob&s;tinacy!' he exclaimed; 'Then here it mu&s;t end.'</P>
<P>'So &s;aying, he ru&s;hed out of the room, and I &s;aw

no more of him; nor did I &s;ee any one el&s;e for about an hour, when, to my &s;urpri&s;e, he again entered the room.'</P>
<P>'You are re&s;olved then, Antoinette,' he &s;aid, 'to be immured here for life?'</P>
<P>'I am re&s;olved never to marry the count de St. Pol.'</P>
<P>'Good heavens!' he &s;aid, 'Could I have thought it?'&mdash;He turned towards the door; he looked at me again;&mdash;'I am going, Antoinette,' he &s;aid.</P>
<P>'And, cannot I recal you, my father!'</P>
<P>'Yes, Antoinette, there is one way, and only one;&mdash;my honour is pledged, and that I cannot &s;a|crifice.'</P>
<P>'Nor can I ever wed as you de&s;ire.'</P>
<P>'Good God! Good God!' he cried, and went out of the room violently agitated; and in a few mi|nutes I heard the coach drive off.</P>
<P>'I was immediately put under the care of one of the &s;uperiors, who has orders never to leave me, ex|cept when I come here to confe&s;&s;ion;&mdash;but &s;he is kind to me, and really &s;eems to compa&s;&s;ionate my &s;ituation. I am not permitted to &s;ee any one, and, at the expiration of a year, orders are given by my fa|ther, that I &s;hould take the veil.'</P>
<P>Such was the relation given me by Antoinette, of the conte&s;ts which &s;he had had with the baron, and the baron with him&s;elf; in which it &s;eemed apparent, that the latter had &s;uffered fal&s;e notions of honour, at la&s;t to overcome paternal affection, though that had maintained the conte&s;t to the la&s;t moment; and it was even probable, that the baron him&s;elf was &s;carcely le&s;s a &s;ufferer from the conflict, than the victim of his per&s;ecution. I then imparted to An|toinette, how much I had been urged by my father to return to Ireland, as &s;oon as ever, by the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ath of poor mr. Lew&s;on, I &s;hould be relea&s;ed from my atten|dance on him; for he earne&s;tly wi&s;hed me to reach Ireland again&s;t the time when I was to come of age.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="038283_0181_10119663B6C57048">She begged me earne&s;tly not to let my attachment to her interfere with this wi&s;h of my father's, and urged me to &s;et out immediately on my return, and leave her to her fate.</P>
<P>'How can my Antoinette,' I &s;aid, '&s;uppo&s;e that I could de&s;ert her at a moment like the pre&s;ent? But I would &s;ugge&s;t a plan, which I hope would make us mutually happy, and end our troubles at once.'</P>
<P>'And, how can that be?' &s;he a&s;ked eagerly.</P>
<P>I then ventured to &s;ugge&s;t to her the po&s;&s;ibility of our being privately married in An&s;elm's cell; and that by his a&s;&s;i&s;tance al&s;o, I thought it po&s;&s;ible that we might accompli&s;h her e&s;cape from her convent, when &s;he might accompany me to Ireland, where &s;he would be under the protection of my father and my&s;elf; and as to my father, I doubted not of obtaining his ready forgivene&s;s for the &s;tep I had taken.</P>
<P>She pau&s;ed and he&s;itated what an&s;wer to make to my propo&s;al, and at la&s;t &s;aid, 'She could not then de|termine what to do, but bade me meet her again in three days at An&s;elm's cell, by which time &s;he would have taken her re&s;olution, and if it &s;hould be to comply with my wi&s;hes, the ceremony &s;hould at that time be performed; but bade me not be too &s;anguine in my hopes; that even when united, our troubles would not be at an end, for &s;he &s;aw nothing but rocks and &s;hoals around us, on &s;ome of which it was &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible but that we &s;hould &s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t.' We then took our leave of each other for that time, as &s;he &s;aid &s;he did not dare &s;tay any longer, and after agreeing with An&s;elm that we &s;hould meet again in three days, &s;he retired to her room, and I returned with Clement to my inn.</P>
<P>At the expiration of the term agreed on, Clement and I ha&s;tened to the place of appointment, where I had not been arrived many minutes, before Antoi|nette appeared, accompanied by the &s;uperior, to who&s;e care &s;he was entru&s;ted.

<P>The holy man pronounced the proper vows and ble&s;&s;ings, and in a &s;hort &s;pace of time I was ble&s;&s;ed with the delightful reflection, that Antoinette was my wife. She told me to remain with An&s;elm, and at night Marianne &s;hould conduct me to her apartment, and then hurried away, almo&s;t overcome with the va|riety of feelings which agitated her &s;oul.

<P>In the&s;e alternate hopes and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ears, I &s;pent my time, 'till the arrival of Marianne, under who&s;e conduct I arrived &s;afely, by various turnings and windings, at Antoinette's apartment, and returned by the &s;ame means to An&s;elm's cell the next morning, from whence I departed undi&s;covered to my inn, after he had opened to me a plan, which Marianne and he had been concerting, for Antoinette's e&s;cape, in which Marianne meant to accompany her, as &s;he ardently &s;ighed to quit her mona&s;tic life; and this project, he &s;aid, he hoped would be more matured, when I &s;hould return in the evening, which he allowed me to do.</P>
<P>In the evening, then, he imparted to me the whole plan which they had concerted, and which was to be carried into execution in three nights from that time. I pa&s;&s;ed the night again in Antoinette's apartment, when we agreed to meet no more, 'till &s;he was without the walls of the convent. Every thing was &s;ettled

<P>Tho&s;e, and tho&s;e only, who have been in a like &s;ituation, can form an idea of my feelings, during the painful interval of &s;u&s;pen&s;e, between the &s;ettling of this &s;cheme, and the time of action.

<P>Only &s;ix hours were remaining to the appointed time of my meeting with Antoinette, when Clement came to me, and with a voice and countenance, which &s;ufficiently &s;pake the intere&s;t he took in the melancholy news, of which he was the bearer, told me, that An&s;elm had that morning been found dead in his cell. Of this event a vague rumour had reached his (Clement's) ears, which cau&s;ed him to go imme|diately to the convent to inform him&s;elf, whether it were true or not, when he received a full and melan|choly conviction, that the rumour he had heard was founded in fact. He had obtained a moment's in|terview with Marianne, who had only time to tell him, that in con&s;equence of this event, all thoughts of their flight from the convent, mu&s;t for the pre&s;ent be at an end, and that Antoinette would, if po&s;&s;ible, convey a letter to me in a day or two; and, in the mean time, &s;he charged me, as I valued our mutual &s;afety, not to attempt coming to the convent.</P>

<P>Three days, however, elap&s;ed, during which time he con&s;tantly hovered about the convent, before he could bring me any intelligence of her.

<P>He lo&s;t no time in bringing the letter to me, which I opened and read with as much eagerne&s;s as the parched traveller feels, when he &s;pies a lonely &s;hell with one &s;ingle drop of water &s;tanding in its cavity. It contained many a&s;&s;urances of her affection, and lamentations for our late di&s;appointment; but &s;he earne&s;tly entreated me not to think any more, at that time, of her e&s;cape, for it was then a matter of im|po&s;&s;ibility.

<P>IT is needle&s;s to relate the public events which fol|lowed, on my arrival in Ireland; you, alas, my Ho|ratia, knew them but too well; it is &s;ufficient that I relate tho&s;e &s;ecret events, which are known to my&s;elf alone.</P>
<P>Week after week pa&s;&s;ed over my head, &s;till finding me in anxious expectation of hearing from my An|toinette, and &s;till leaving me di&s;appointed. I knew not what to think of it; I thought it unju&s;t to Cle|ment, to &s;uppo&s;e that he had deceived me, and been unfaithful to his promi&s;es; but I knew not how to ac|count for his &s;ilence. A thou&s;and times was I on the point of di&s;clo&s;ing the whole affair of my marriage to my father, but the &s;ecrecy enjoined me by my An|toinette, as often with-held my tongue. I wi&s;hed to have left Arlington ca&s;tle, in order to have thrown, if po&s;&s;ible, a greater damp on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> plan, which I &s;aw my father &s;o eagerly pur&s;uing; but I did not dare to &s;tir, while I was kept in &s;uch uncertainty, as to my Antoinette; and while my ab&s;ence from the ca&s;tle might have endangered a letter falling into hands that I &s;hould not wi&s;h.</P>
<P>At length, after &s;ix months &s;pent in mo&s;t dreadful &s;u&s;pen&s;e, a letter arrived from my Antoinette, which brought me the plea&s;ing intelligence, that by the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance
<PB N="188" REF="038283_0187_10119679A01011A0">
of her brother, the chevalier de St. Foix, a plan was formed for her e&s;cape from the convent, which was to be carried into execution in the cour&s;e of a few days, from the time of her writ|ing; and that the chevalier would conduct her to Ireland, where he would &s;tay 'till he heard the event of the baron's being made acquainted with their proceedings. Still &s;he wi&s;hed that the affair &s;hould be kept &s;ecret from my father, 'till her arrival in Ire|land, which &s;he hoped would be in about a month.</P>
<P>She told me too, that various plans had been form|ed for her e&s;cape, but ob&s;tacles had occurred, to pre|vent their execution; and hinted the additional anxie|ty &s;he felt to get away from the convent, on account of her own &s;ituation, which made her &s;tay in it every day more and more un&s;afe for her. There were al|lu&s;ions al&s;o to a former letter which &s;he had written to me, and to two letters from Clement, none of which, as I have already &s;aid, I had ever received.</P>
<P>My anxiety for my Antoinette was not at all re|lieved by this letter; I had &s;till every thing to fear for her, and yet it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to attempt going to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance; I was vexed and fretted too, at her continuing her injunctions of &s;ecrecy, for it placed me in a mo&s;t painful &s;ituation with regard to my fa|ther, to whom I earne&s;tly wi&s;hed to lay open my heart; but as Antoinette de&s;ired me to be &s;ecret, I was determined to be &s;o at all hazards.</P>
<P>If the fir&s;t &s;ix months, however, had been a &s;tare of dreadful anxiety to me, judge what I mu&s;t have &s;uffered, when near &s;ix months longer elap&s;ed, with|out my hearing any thing farther of the object, for whom all this anxiety was &s;uffered. You know too well, my dear Horatia, to what extremities matters were brought between me and my father;&mdash;a thou|&s;and times had my &s;ecret been ready to bur&s;t from my lips, but as often did I revolt from a di&s;clo&s;ure, which I found I had every rea&s;on to dread. I, however, certainly &s;hould have told all to my father, at the mo|ment
<PB N="189" REF="038283_0188_1011967B2A06E940">
when he had pa&s;&s;ed the dreadful &s;entence on me, 'That I &s;hould con&s;ent in three days to wed as he de&s;ired me, or be bani&s;hed his pre&s;ence for ever:' had he not gone &s;o ha&s;tily out of the room, that he left me no time to collect my &s;pirits for the painful communication, and all my thoughts of that communication were immediately after put an end to by the events that followed.</P>
<P>My father had not quitted the room more than five minutes, when a &s;ervant came and informed me, that a woman de&s;ired to &s;peak to me in private I ordered her to be &s;hewn to my own room, whither I immediately went my&s;elf, when the woman told me that &s;he brought me melancholy news of my Antoi|nette: but as the &s;tory was long, &s;he hoped I would excu&s;e her imparting it to me then, but begged me to meet her at an inn &s;he named at Killarney. I would have accompanied her thither, but &s;he &s;aid, 'It is better that we &s;hould not go together.' She therefore departed, by her&s;elf, and I &s;et out in a few minutes after, taking a different route from that which &s;he had pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>When I arrived at the place of appointment, &s;he conducted me into a parlour, where &s;ate the mi&s;tre&s;s of the inn, with a child in her arms. Joanna (for that was the name of the woman who had reque&s;ted my attendance there) took the child from her and then de&s;ired her to leave the room. When &s;he was gone, Joanna drew from her bo&s;om a &s;ealed packet of papers, and placing them, together with the child, in my arms,</P>
<P>'Behold, &s;ir,' &s;he &s;aid, 'the dying pre&s;ent of your dear Antoinette!&mdash;She charged me to deliver this infant, and this packet, into your own hands, and here I di&s;charge my tru&s;t.'</P>
<P>She then bur&s;t into a torrent of tears;&mdash;I pre&s;&s;ed the infant to my brea&s;t, and fell back in my chair al|mo&s;t &s;en&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>Lord Arlington ro&s;e up from his &s;eat;&mdash;he walked
<PB N="190" REF="038283_0189_1011967E449606C8">
up and down the room for a few minutes, violently agitated, then &s;at down again.</P>
<P>'Excu&s;e me,' he &s;aid, 'I cannot dwell on this &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ene; no words can de&s;cribe it; and I can hardly bear to think on it. After a long &s;ilence, I de&s;ired Joanna to tell me the whole &s;tory.'</P>
<P>'Tho&s;e papers, &s;ir,' &s;he replied, 'contain it as far as the departed angel could tell of it;&mdash;what is wanting there I will &s;upply.'</P>
<P>I opened the packet, which contained a detail from Antoinette, of the events that had happened to her &s;ince her la&s;t letter to me, which was in &s;ub&s;tance as follows:</P>
<P>She got &s;afe from the convent at the time appoint|ed by her brother, but was unfortunately, at la&s;t, obliged to leave Marianne behind, for only two days before that appointed for their departure, &s;he had broken her leg by a fall, which made her flight, at that time, impo&s;&s;ible; and as it was equally impo&s;&s;i|ble for Antoinette to delay her departure, &s;he was obliged to e&s;cape by her&s;elf. She found her brother in waiting for her with a chai&s;e, about a quarter of a mile from the convent, and they got to Mar&s;eilles without meeting any interruption. They there agreed for their pa&s;&s;age in a &s;hip, which was to &s;ail for Li&s;bon next morning; but in the evening, as they were get|ting from the boat which conveyed them to the &s;hip it&s;elf, another boat which they had perceived to put off from the &s;hore very &s;oon after theirs, came up, and four men from it jumped into their boat, and &s;eized on the chevalier and Antoinette, exclaim|ing, that that they were their pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>The chevalier attempted to make &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance, in which he was &s;econded by the men belonging to his own boat, and a &s;evere &s;cuffle en&s;ued, in which the brave, but unfortunate chevalier was pierced through the brea&s;t, by the &s;word of one of the a&s;&s;ail|ants, when he &s;taggered again&s;t the &s;ide of the boat, f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll over-board into the water, and was &s;een no more.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="038283_0190_1011967FD3094A80">'Good God!' exclaimed Mar&s;ini, 'And was &s;uch the fate of the mo&s;t amiable of men?&mdash;I had always under&s;tood that he was killed in a duel.'</P>
<P>'So it was reported,' &s;aid lord Arlington, 'but the fact is as I relate to you; he fell a &s;acrifice to fraternal affection, which, from the account given me of him, by my poor Antoinette, he carried to a height far exceeding the u&s;ual level of that amiable di&s;po|&s;ition.'</P>
<P>'Oh, &s;he told you truly!' &s;aid Mar&s;ini; 'But I beg your lord&s;hip's pardon for this interruption.&mdash; Pray go on.'</P>
<P>Lord Arlington proceeded.&mdash;This dreadful di&s;a&s;ter ca&s;t &s;uch a damp over the minds of every one, that no farther re&s;i&s;tance was made, and Antoinette was car|ried off by the ruffians; who, without regard to any thing but their orders, hurried her away, nor &s;topped 'till they had depo&s;ited her &s;afe in the chateau de St. Foix, where &s;he was doomed to meet alone, and un|friended, the frowns and menaces of an enraged father, to mourn the untimely fate of a brother, whom &s;he doted on, and who had fallen in her &s;ervice;&mdash;and to reflect on the dreadful &s;ituation to which an infant, &s;he was likely &s;oon to bring into the world, would be expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>An unfortunate circum&s;tance had attended the flight of Antoinette, which &s;he could not fore&s;ee or prepare again&s;t. The baron, whom &s;he believed &s;till at Paris, nor likely for &s;ome time to return to the chateau, had &s;uddenly arrived there the evening of her flight. He knew that his &s;on had been for &s;ome time returned from Italy, and had been re&s;ident at the chateau, and he therefore inquired for him im|mediately on his arrival there, when he was told that he had gone that morning to the convent, to &s;ee his &s;i&s;ter, and he perhaps would not return for two or three days.</P>
<P>As the baron was really anxious to &s;ee his &s;on, who had &s;o long been ab&s;ent from him, he re&s;olved
<PB N="192" REF="038283_0191_10119684F305DFD8">
to go very early next morning to the convent, where he did not doubt but he &s;hould meet with him, and where he &s;hould al&s;o &s;ee his daughter, and find what temper &s;he was in, after &s;ome months of confinement. He, accordingly, &s;et off, and arrived at the convent ju&s;t after the fir&s;t alarm had been &s;pread, that An|toinette was mi&s;&s;ing; and ju&s;t as intelligence arrived, from two &s;couts who had been &s;ent out to make en|quiries, that a chai&s;e had been &s;een going in great ha&s;te the road to Mar&s;eilles, which was &s;uppo&s;ed to contain the fugitives. The baron therefore lo&s;t no time in &s;ending four men after them, who &s;ucceeded in their errand but too well.</P>
<P>Antoinette was all a&s;toni&s;hment when &s;he beheld her father, whom &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed to have been at that moment &s;o many miles off. He approached her with eyes &s;parkling with rage, and vented the mo&s;t bitter reproaches again&s;t her;&mdash;but &s;oon after, his reproaches were changed into expre&s;&s;ions of the mo&s;t poignant affliction for the death of his &s;on, who was, he &s;aid, the only &s;upport in a direct line of his ancient hou&s;e, and his titles and e&s;tates would now go to a collateral branch, twenty degrees removed from him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Thus, in alternate reproaches and bewailings, he gave vent to his feelings, 'till, at la&s;t, he ordered An|toinette to her chamber, and told her to prepare her|&s;elf, for returning, in a few days, to the convent.</P>
<P>'Yes,' &s;aid Antoinette firmly, 'I will prepare my|&s;elf to return thither, and &s;hall go with the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s concern, as I know my captivity cannot be of long duration, for the grave will &s;oon relea&s;e me from it.'</P>
<P>The baron looked &s;ternly at her; 'Yes,' &s;aid he, 'That is the common cant of your &s;ex, when they are thwarted in their perver&s;e inclinations; but I am not to be &s;o fooled; but 'tis in your own power, madam, to &s;horten your captivity as much as you plea&s;e; con|&s;ent to marry St. Pol, and it is at an end; otherwi&s;e, at the end of the year you take the veil.'</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="038283_0192_10119686D7698F90">'And I would rather,' &s;he replied, 'take the veil, than con&s;ent to &s;o dete&s;ted an union.'</P>
<P>She was then conducted to her chamber, and a &s;ervant, devoted to the baron, was ordered to attend her, and &s;trictly to guard her.</P>
<P>In this confinement, however, &s;he was not ab&s;olutely de&s;titute of comfort. Joanna, daughter to the porter of the ca&s;tle, was ju&s;t then come on a vi&s;it to her father. She had, by means of the barone&s;s de St. Foix, re|ceived a much better education than young women in her &s;ituation u&s;ually obtain, and being but little older than Antoinette, had been much her companion; 'till Joanna, when &s;he was about &s;eventeen, went to live with a relation, who was in a very profitable branch of trade at Lyons, where &s;he married a young man in the &s;ame line of bu&s;ine&s;s as her uncle, but who died about a year after their marriage, and left her with a very fine boy, and it was not more than three months from the death of her hu&s;band, that &s;he, with her child, came to the chateau de St. Foix, to vi&s;it her father.</P>
<P>She well knew the unfortunate &s;ituation of An|toinette, and when &s;he found that &s;he was to be kept in &s;uch &s;trict confinement at the chateau, &s;he deter|mined, at the hazard of the baron's anger, to admi|ni&s;ter all the con&s;olation to her that was in her power, for &s;he was a young woman of more than common &s;pirit and re&s;olution, and who&s;e affection for Antoi|nette was &s;uch, that nothing &s;eemed formidable to her, when &s;he thought &s;he could render her any &s;er|vice, as the &s;equel of my &s;tory will &s;hew. This young woman's attentions alleviated the confinement of Antoinette, while &s;he remained at the chateau, and when &s;he was carried back to the convent, which was in about ten days, &s;he promi&s;ed often to come and vi&s;it her.</P>
<P>But all this time, the baron never appeared to have any &s;u&s;picion of his daughter's &s;ituation: he, indeed, &s;aw her but &s;eldom, and when he did &s;ee her, he was
<PB N="194" REF="038283_0193_1011968DB65A98B8">
always much more occupied in bewailing the lo&s;s of his &s;on, than in attending to her. He &s;everal times mentioned the match with St. Pol; but &s;he as con&s;tantly refu&s;ed to hear any thing he had to &s;ay on that &s;ub|ject. When he talked of carrying her back to the convent, &s;he pre&s;&s;ed him to let her continue at the chateau for the &s;hort remainder of her days, offering to give him her &s;olemn a&s;&s;urance not to attempt e&s;|caping from thence.</P>
<P>He ridiculed the idea of her not living much longer; &mdash;&s;aid that the ruddy hue of her cheeks did not look as if her end was very near; mi&s;taking the hectic flu&s;h of fever, for the florid bloom of health; and as to her promi&s;es, he &s;aid, he knew very well how far a woman's word was to be taken; and that, as he was obliged to return again to Paris very &s;oon, he &s;hould choo&s;e to place her where he knew &s;he would be mo&s;t effectually &s;ecured, and he &s;hould take care that &s;he &s;hould not have it in her power to e&s;cape again from the convent.</P>
<P>The&s;e cruel taunts wounded poor Antoinette even more deeply than all the other cruelties her father had exerci&s;ed towards her. She plainly perceived that her health was daily declining, from the fatigues of body and anxiety of mind which &s;he had undergone, and only dreaded, that &s;he &s;hould not live to bring her infant into the world. With emphatic expre&s;&s;ions of the&s;e feelings; with the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of her regard for me; with ardent wi&s;hes for my happine&s;s, and an anxious recommendation of her child, if it &s;hould live to come into my hands, to my love and protection, &s;he clo&s;ed the intere&s;ting narrative &s;he &s;ent me, which Joanna then pur&s;ued to the following effect.</P>
<P>Lord Arlington's voice had &s;everal times been al|mo&s;t choaked with &s;tifled agony, while he went through this affecting recital; but the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing part &s;till remained untold.&mdash;He pau&s;ed;&mdash;he wiped away tears which he could no longer repre&s;s, and, at

length, proceeded thus, &s;peaking in the per&s;on of Joanna, by whom the latter part of Antoinette's &s;tory was related to him.</P>
<P>I had frequently vi&s;ited Antoinette at the Con|vent: for the abbe&s;s, more &s;en&s;ible to the alarming &s;tate of her health, than the baron, was de&s;irous of affording her every po&s;&s;ible comfort, and, therefore, allowed me to have free acce&s;s to her. She had of|ten talked to me of the per&s;ecution &s;he had received from her father on St. Pol's account, and appeared as if there was more &s;he wi&s;hed to &s;ay to me, rela|tive to her&s;elf, but that &s;he hardly knew how to give it utterance. At la&s;t, one day, when I found her particularly ill and dejected, I pre&s;&s;ed her much to unbo&s;om her&s;elf entirely to me, as I &s;aw there was &s;omething &s;at heavy on her mind, which it would be a relief to her to di&s;clo&s;e; indeed, from her appearance, I had no difficulty to gue&s;s, in part, the &s;ecret which &s;he &s;eemed hardly to have power to di&s;clo&s;e. She &s;ighed and he&s;itated what an&s;wer &s;he &s;hould make, but at length, &s;aid,</P>
<P>'My dear Joanna, you a&s;k for a &s;tory which I have &s;carcely power to relate; but I have received &s;uch kind attention from you, as encourages me not only to tell my &s;tory, but to communicate a reque&s;t which I have for a long time ardently wi&s;hed to make to you;&mdash;the bolde&s;t, &s;ure, that ever was made, but which I have rea&s;on to believe your re&s;olution, and &s;trong affection for me, will induce you to comply with.'</P>
<P>She then related to me all the particulars of her connection with you, and concluded with &s;aying,</P>
<P>'I feel, Joanna, that it is impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould &s;urvive my approaching confinement; can you re|&s;olve to take my child under your protection as &s;oon as it is born, and if I &s;hould die, to carry it to Ire|land, and place it in the arms of its father?'</P>
<P>To this reque&s;t I yielded a ready, a hearty a&s;&s;ent; for the dangers of the undertaking &s;eemed nothing to

me, when it was to gratify the wi&s;h of Antoinette&punc; and never &s;hall I forget the tran&s;ports which &s;parkled in her eyes, at the a&s;&s;en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> I had given.</P>
<P>''Tis vain,' &s;he &s;aid, 'my deare&s;t Joanna, for me to attempt to thank you: How poor are words, to expre&s;s my obligations to you, or the gratitude I feel for them?&mdash;the heart, which, like your's, is ca|pable of performing &s;uch an action as you have undertaken, can alone feel what is due to it for the action it performs: nor would I di&s;grace you by offer|ing only the common effu&s;ions of a grateful mind.'</P>
<P>She gave me many directions concerning the child, and &s;aid, 'that &s;he had expre&s;&s;ed her wi&s;hes with regard to it, very fully, in her letters to her hu&s;band&punc; which &s;he &s;hould give me to carry with the child.' She often too, after this, talked to me of her hu&s;band, mentioning him with the mo&s;t ardent expre&s;&s;ions of affection, and regretting all the unea&s;ine&s;s which &s;he had occa&s;ioned him.&mdash;'He was happy,' &s;he would &s;ay, ''till he knew me: would to heaven he had ne|ver known me!'</P>
<P>At length the moment arrived, when in the pre|&s;ence only of Marianne, my&s;elf, and a &s;urgeon, whom we had privately engaged for the purpo&s;e, this &s;weet infant came into the world&punc; Antoinette &s;urvived her delivery, but it &s;eemed &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible that &s;he &s;hould &s;urvive it for many hours; a rapid con&s;umption had preyed upon her for &s;ome weeks, under which &s;he was apparently &s;inking. She called me to her bed&s;ide; I had the child in my arms;</P>
<P>'Let me give her one ki&s;s,' &s;he &s;aid, 'It is the fir&s;t and the la&s;t &s;he will ever receive from her unfor|tunate mother.&mdash;Take her, Joanna, take her to my Theodore, place her in his arms, and tell him 'tis the dying gift of one who fondly and faithfully loved him, and who will ble&s;s him with her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ate&s;t breath.'</P>
<P>I took the child; I was &s;o wounded in my heart, that I could not bid the mother farewel, although I was convinced that I &s;hould never &s;ee her more; I

wrapped the child carefully in my cloak, and having lulled her to &s;leep, conveyed her away unob&s;erved from the convent.</P>
<P>I carried her to my father's hou&s;e, and I deter|mined, that as my own child was perfectly healthy, and did not want my nur&s;ing, I would transfer that nouri&s;hment from him, to the infant Antoinette, for &s;o I called the child, after her mother; and the next day I went to the convent, where I learnt, that An|toinette had expired about an hour before my arrival there: but I did not &s;ee Marianne.</P>
<P>I now began to plan all things for my intended journey. I told my father and mother what I had undertaken, and de&s;ired them to carry my child to my uncle at Lyons, who had often &s;aid he would adopt him as his &s;on. They thought me ra&s;h, but if any thing could excu&s;e it, they &s;aid certainly the obliga|tions they had to Antoinette would. My journey was ha&s;tened too, by a rumour which came that very day to the chateau, that the baron would be there in a day or two; and I thought it would be highly imprudent in me to delay my departure 'till after his arrival.</P>
<P>I accordingly &s;et out two days after the death of An|toinette, and arrived &s;afely at Mar&s;eilles, where I had a cou&s;in, who was ma&s;ter of a &s;hip in the Li&s;bon trade, and by his means I got a pa&s;&s;age on board that &s;hip, which conveyed us to Li&s;bon, and by means of my cou&s;in's connexions there, I was recommended to a captain of a &s;hip, bound from Li&s;bon to Cork, at which place I arrived two days &s;ince; and, according to the directions which I received from Antoinette, came on to Killarney, and have thus, I hope, faithfully di&s;charged the &s;acred tru&s;t which &s;he committed to me.</P>

<P>MY attention was now turned entirely to con&s;idering what cour&s;e I had be&s;t pur&s;ue, with regard to my dear infant, and to the union which my father was &s;o earne&s;t to accompli&s;h. At length I re&s;olved to comply with him, and for the pre&s;ent to keep my child in concealment. Joanna promi&s;ed me to &s;tay with her at lea&s;t as long as &s;he wanted a nur&s;e, and I therefore looked out for a &s;ituation for them, and &s;oon engaged mrs. Roberts to take them.

<P>The letter which occa&s;ioned my abrupt departure from you, my Horatia, and which you &s;o well remem|ber my receiving, was to the following effect, as near as I can recollect.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>'You have been cruelly deceived, &s;ir, in &s;uppo&s;ing your Antoinette to be no more; &s;he is now alive, and in the convent, where you left her. She took the veil at the expiration of the year, but that would be no bar to her attempting an e&s;cape again, if her hu&s;|band were to come and a&s;&s;i&s;t her in the undertaking.

I have an unexpected chance of &s;ending you this letter. I wi&s;h Antoinette could avail her&s;elf of it, to &s;end one al&s;o, but that is impo&s;&s;ible.

</LETTER>
<P>'Good God!' I exclaimed, when I got out of the hou&s;e, 'And is this greate&s;t of mi&s;eries re&s;erved for me?&mdash;Am I then the hu&s;band of two wives?'</P>
<P>I flew to Killarney, to mrs. Roberts's hou&s;e, and enquired of Joanna, whether it was &s;he who had brought the letter to me? and by what means it had come to her?&mdash;She told me that it came enclo&s;ed in a parcel to her from her father; and that as &s;he knew I was to leave Arlington ca&s;tle the next morning, &s;he immediately carried it there for me, never &s;u&s;pecting what the contents might be.</P>
<P>I immediately re&s;olved to &s;et out without delay for the convent, that I might &s;atisfy my&s;elf of the truth or fal&s;ehood of what had thus been communicated to me; for I could not bear the idea of remaining for a moment with my &s;econd wife, while there was a po&s;&s;ibility that my fir&s;t might be yet alive. When I declared my de&s;ign to Joanna, &s;he &s;aid, 'She wi&s;hed I would find &s;ome means of di&s;po&s;ing of my child, and let her accompany me, as &s;he was de&s;irous of return|ing to her own child and country.'</P>
<P>This reque&s;t was too rea&s;onable for me to he&s;itate a moment about complying with; it was one which indeed I could not refu&s;e; my only difficulty was, how to di&s;po&s;e of my Antoinette. I revolved many plans in my mind, and at la&s;t determined on that which I executed; and having written my letter, and given my directions to mrs. Roberts, Joanna and I &s;et off for Limerick, where we got on board a ve&s;&s;el bound for Bilboa, front whence we determined to cro&s;s the Pyrenees into France.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="038283_0199_1011978CAC4FD388">In the bay of Bi&s;cay we were overtaken by a violent &s;torm, which drove us out of our cour&s;e, and after encountering dreadful perils at &s;ea, we were at la&s;t wrecked on the coa&s;t of Portugal. We then made the be&s;t of our way to Li&s;bon, where we agreed for a pa&s;&s;age to Mar&s;eilles, on board a Li&s;bon &s;hip; but after we had pa&s;&s;ed the &s;treights, we were overtaken by another &s;torm, more violent than that we had en|countered in the bay of Bi&s;cay, and which drove us towards the coa&s;t of Africa. Our &s;hip rode it out for a con&s;iderable time, but at la&s;t the captain bid us all repair to the boats, for the &s;hip could not hold to|gether for two hours longer. The boats were ac|cordingly hoi&s;ted out, and as many of us as could, got into them; but here I met with another di&s;a&s;ter, which rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly almo&s;t made me think that there was a &s;omething in my&s;elf, which was contagious to every one who had any concern with me, and that I and misfortune were &s;o coupled together, that whoever was connected with the one, mu&s;t inevitably expe|rience the baneful influence of the other. As my faithful and friendly Joanna was de&s;cending from the &s;hip, her foot mi&s;&s;ed its hold, &s;he fell into the &s;ea, and a va&s;t billow in a moment &s;wept her from our fight.</P>
<P>We had not left the &s;hip many minutes, before we plainly perceived her foundering, and in a &s;hort time &s;he vani&s;hed for ever. We got &s;afe, however, to the coa&s;t of Africa, but there we all were made &s;laves by the Algerines. I had the good fortune, however, to fall into tolerable mild hands, &s;o that I had, from the fir&s;t, a pro&s;pect, that I might, by indu&s;|try, one day work out my freedom; and &s;o, in fact, I did. After a &s;ervitude of &s;even years, I had, by care and prudent management, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;&s;ed a &s;um &s;ufficient to purcha&s;e my freedom, and procure my&s;elf a pa&s;&s;age to Mar&s;eilles: and this I managed too, without part|ing with my gold watch, which I had the fortune to conceal at my fir&s;t landing, and the lo&s;s of which I &s;hould have regretted, as much as one who had &s;o
<PB N="201" REF="038283_0200_1011825E3622B808">
many deeper cau&s;es of &s;orrow, could have regretted a bauble.</P>
<P>I no &s;ooner found my&s;elf again on French ground, than I ha&s;tened to the chateau de St. Foix, in order to &s;eek out the father of Joanna; but I met him &s;trag|gling about, looking very melancholy, before I reached the chateau. He knew me the moment he ca&s;t his eyes on me, and lifting up his hands and eyes, thanked heaven that he had &s;een me again, and eagerly en|quired for his daughter, who&s;e &s;ad fate I related to him, cloathing it in as tender terms, as &s;o &s;orrowful a tale would admit of. He was deeply affected by it, but &s;aid, at la&s;t, 'That it was more &s;atisfactory to him to be certain of her fate, than to live on in the dreadful uncertainty about her, in which he had &s;pent the la&s;t &s;even years.'</P>
<P>I a&s;ked him then, 'Whether the baron was at that time at the chateau?'</P>
<P>'Alas! &s;ir,' he replied, 'the baron is in a melan|choly &s;ituation; deranged in his mind, I fear.'</P>
<P>He then proceeded to tell me, that he had very lately &s;old all his moveables, and as much of his e&s;tates as was in his power; and that the re&s;t of his e&s;tates he had con&s;igned over to his next heir, who was a di&s;tant relation; that he had then di&s;charged all his &s;ervants, and went away him&s;elf by night, nor did any one know what was become of him; 'And thus, &s;ir,' &s;aid the porter, 'I am thrown out of a place, where I had lived for &s;o many years, and never failed in my duty, that I know of: to be &s;ure, it makes me a little heart broken; but thank God I am not &s;tarving; I have enough, however, to live upon, and that is, at lea&s;t, &s;ome comfort.'</P>
<P>I then mentioned to him the letter I had received, which reported Antoinette to be &s;till alive, and en|quired how it came into his hands, as it was through him that it was tran&s;mitted to me. He &s;aid, 'That he perfectly well remembered tran&s;mitting me a letter at the time I mentioned, and that it was brough<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to

<P>'As to the death of Antoinette,' &s;aid he, 'I never heard the truth of it doubted; but convents are &s;trange places, and we don't always know what is going forwards in them. But my ma&s;ter made a great &s;torming when he came here, and found that his daughter was buried at the convent; and he threat|ened to have the body removed to his own vault, in the chapel of the chateau; but however, he never had it done:&mdash;but to be &s;ure, his lord&s;hip was very &s;trange then, and &s;o he was from that time 'till he went away; but at fir&s;t he was all anger, and there was no &s;uch thing as plea&s;ing him, and he would &s;wear and &s;torm for nothing almo&s;t:&mdash;but then, all on a &s;udden he grew mild and melancholy, and was always moping about;&mdash;and then he&punc; u&s;ed to go for ever to the convent, and would come home with his eyes &s;welled with crying; and it's my opinion now, that he is gone on &s;ome penance.&mdash;But then,' &s;aid the porter, &s;tarting, 'to be &s;ure madame Antoinette mu&s;t be dead, for my lord has put up a grand monu|ment in the chapel for her, and his other two chil|dren.&mdash;I could get you a &s;ight of it, if you like.'</P>
<P>Though I by no means thought with the porter, that the erection of this monument was an indi&s;puta|ble proof of the death of Antoinette, which from his whole &s;tory &s;eemed to me indeed to be very doubt|ful, yet I wi&s;hed to &s;ee the monument he mentioned, and therefore accepted his offer. He then took me with him to his own hou&s;e, and &s;aid 'he would go and &s;ee how the land lay for getting to the cha|pel, as we could not go if mon&s;ieur de St. Foix was at home.' He pre&s;ently returned, and &s;aid, 'that if I would accompany him, we might then &s;ee the mo|nument.'</P>

piece of &s;culpture, but the in&s;cription on it was of &s;o &s;ingular a nature, that it rather confirmed me in the idea, that Antoinette was &s;till alive, and was known by her father, to be &s;o. On a &s;arcophagus are three bu&s;ts, in white marble, of the chevalier and his two &s;i&s;ters: the chevalier in the middle, Gabrielle on the right hand, and Antoinette on the left; and below them is the following in&s;cription: <Q><L>Oh!

<P>The body of the third is enclo&s;ed within the walls of St. Marguerite's convent!&mdash;What an equivocal kind of expre&s;&s;ion! thought I within my&s;elf, as I read it, and I determined if po&s;&s;ible to be better informed about the matter. I, therefore took my leave of the porter, and immediately &s;et forwards for the con|vent.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t enquiries, when I arrived in its neighbour|hood,
<PB N="204" REF="038283_0203_10119740148C8750">
were, for my worthy friend Clement; but I learnt that he had left the place a &s;hort time before, without mentioning his intended departure to any one. I was then entirely at a lo&s;s how to proceed: I would have applied to the lady abbe&s;s, but I thought that I &s;hould hardly receive any &s;atisfaction from her; and, if my Antoinette really was alive, and in the convent, enquiring of the lady abbe&s;s would put &s;u&s;picions into her head, which might tend to fru&s;|trate any plan, that might be formed for her e&s;cape.</P>
<P>I continued to hover about the convent in a pil|grim's garb, which I had procured at Vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nne, for the purpo&s;e of a di&s;gui&s;e, 'till I at la&s;t attracted the notice of the porter of the convent, who, like the generality of his profe&s;&s;ion, was of a very talkative di&s;po&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n.</P>
<P>He a&s;ked me many que&s;tions relative to my pil|grimage, and from whence I came, and whither I was going; to all which I gave him rather eva&s;ive an&s;wers, and afterwards drew him into conver&s;ation on the affairs of the convent, which he &s;eemed very willing to communicate: and among&s;t other things he told me, that they had had a very great bu&s;tle in the convent, two or three weeks before, for one of the &s;uperiors had e&s;caped, and taken a young nun away with her.'</P>
<P>I in&s;tantly caught at this &s;tory, and inquired the names of the fugitives; he &s;aid the old one was called Marianne, and the other, he believed Agnes; but he was not &s;ure of her name. He did not know how long either of them had been in the convent, for he had been there but two years, and they were both in before he came. I made particular enquiries, then, concerning the preci&s;e time of their flight, which the porter, after a little recollection, and tracing back a few circum&s;tances, and laying them together at la&s;t, fixed to a certain day, which he named to me. When I had made all the enquiries I wi&s;hed, I took my leave of the porter, fully con|vinced
<PB N="205" REF="038283_0204_10119742B40AD870">
that Agnes, as he called her, was my dear Antoinette, who had very likely changed her name, as it was common to do on taking the veil.</P>
<P>I did not doubt, likewi&s;e, that Clement had ac|companied them; but I was determined to be a&s;cer|tained of that, by enquiring into the exact time when he di&s;appeared; which, by diligent inve&s;tigation, I at la&s;t made out to be the very time, when the two nuns e&s;caped from the convent; and I had, therefore, no doubt remaining, that the three were all gone to Ireland, whither I was determined immediately to follow them.</P>
<P>For a &s;hort time joy, at receiving full conviction, as I thought I had done, that my Antoinette was yet alive, entirely &s;uper&s;eded all other &s;en&s;ations in my bo&s;om; but the dreadful reflection &s;oon obtruded it|&s;elf, that if &s;o, I had then, alas! two wives in exi&s;t|ence at the &s;ame time; a thought that filled me with the deepe&s;t horror. I however re&s;olved, at all events, if po&s;&s;ible, to find my Antoinette, and I accordingly travelled from the banks of the Rhone to Bre&s;t, with almo&s;t incredible &s;wiftne&s;s, con&s;idering that I went every &s;tep of the way on foot, preferring that mode of travelling, as that, in which I could be&s;t be concealed, and for which my pilgrim's dre&s;s was well &s;uited. When I arrived at Bre&s;t, the weather being remarka|bly fine, I got on board an open fi&s;hing boat, in which I was &s;afely conveyed to Cork, where I was no &s;ooner landed, than in &s;pite of all my fatigues, I proceeded onwards, nor &s;topped 'till I arrived at the public hou&s;e ju&s;t by the entrance of the grounds belonging to Arlington ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>I cannot, by de&s;cription, give any idea of the feel|ings which agitated my &s;oul, when I came within &s;ight of the man&s;ion, which I had &s;o &s;trangely left many years before. I was well convinced that I &s;hould now again, in a few hours, behold my long lo&s;t Antoinette: but alas! in what a &s;ituation was I to &s;ee her?&mdash;nor was that the only uncomfortable

&s;en&s;ation I felt; for I not only was to meet my An|toinette as the hu&s;band of another, but I was to meet the averted looks of a ju&s;tly incen&s;ed father, and of an injured wife?</P>
<P>Such were my reflections;&mdash;but, alas! none of the&s;e things were to be encountered. On making en|quiries, I found that the fugitives I was in &s;earch of, whom I wi&s;hed, yet half dreaded to &s;ee, had never arrived in tho&s;e parts; that the father, who&s;e anger I feared to encounter, was no more; and that my wife had left the ca&s;tle half a year before, and was not likely to return to it for &s;everal years. I wi&s;hed however, to &s;ee the hou&s;e; it was an odd kind of curio&s;ity, but I knew not how to &s;uppre&s;s it, nor can I give the lea&s;t rea&s;on for it. But, as I did not like to appear in my own character, or any one that I thought would lead them to &s;u&s;pect who I was, I feigned my&s;eft to be di&s;ordered in my mind.</P>
<P>But it is needle&s;s to dwell on this part of my &s;tory: you know my &s;trange behaviour, my Horatia, both at Arlington Ca&s;tle, and at mr. Sidney's hou&s;e. In|deed, I have often looked back with wonder at my conduct at that time, and been tempted to excu&s;e it to my&s;elf, by believing, that I really was what I feign|ed my&s;elf to be, di&s;ordered in my &s;en&s;es, I was in|deed wounded to the &s;oul, that I could not find the lea&s;t trace of Clement, Marianne, and Antoinette having being either in England or Ireland, and I was determined not to give up the pur&s;uit of them, till I had either &s;een them, or arrived at &s;ome cer|ainty with regard to them.</P>
<P>Yet much I wi&s;hed to &s;ee my wife and children, and leave them &s;ome te&s;timony that I was yet alive, and had not totally forgotten them. I, therefore, went to &s;ee my Henry at the place, where I had learned he was fixed for his education; and drawing from him that his mother and &s;i&s;ter had a hou&s;e not far off, I went thither, in hopes of &s;eeing them; but there I was di&s;appointed. I then went to London,

in hopes of meeting with them there; but there too again I mi&s;&s;ed them; and I dur&s;t not return into Hamp&s;hire, for fear, after the alarm which I knew I mu&s;t have rai&s;ed there, I &s;hould be in &s;ome manner &s;ecured, if I was to be &s;een there again; and I was firmly re&s;olved not to remain in England, or live with my Horatia, while a po&s;&s;ibility re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ained, that I might have another wife alive; though, when I found the people I was in pur&s;uit of, had never been in Eng|land or Ireland, I began much to doubt whether An|toinette could really be one of them, as I could not bear to think that &s;he would not, immediately on her emancipation, have endeavoured to find me out. Yet on the other &s;ide, &s;he might think, that &s;he had ju&s;t cau&s;e of offence again&s;t me, as I mu&s;t appear to her to have been very negligent, when &s;o many years had elap&s;ed &s;ince the time of the letter being &s;ent to me, which announced her being &s;till alive, without her hearing or &s;eeing any thing of me. All the&s;e doubts, however, only made me more and more re|&s;olved to continue the pur&s;uit I was then engaged in; and, for that purpo&s;e, after a few weeks &s;tay in Lon|don, where I know I could be concealed, I once more cro&s;&s;ed the &s;eas, and for the third time in my life, landed in the kingdom of France.</P>

<P>BUT when I was landed, I was utterly at a lo&s;s what cour&s;e to take, in order to accompli&s;h the end, which I was pur&s;uing, and almo&s;t left it to fortune to decide my route.</P>
<P>At length, without knowing why, I took the road to Paris, at which city I &s;oon arrived; but when there, was quite as much at a lo&s;s as ever, in what way I was to proceed, whether to &s;tay there, or whe|ther to go on; and if I went on, which way to go. I was exhau&s;ted with unea&s;ine&s;s and vexation. I felt, that I wanted &s;omething, but I hardly knew what&punc; day after day I wandered about the city, not know|ing what to do with my&s;elf, and hardly knowing which way I went: indeed, &s;carcely in my &s;en&s;es. Often did I &s;tand, with my eyes fixed for many mi|nutes together, on &s;ome per&s;on or thing, till &s;ome|thing rou&s;ed me, and I perceived, with chagrin, what I had been doing.</P>
<P>In one of the&s;e rambles, I wandered one morning into the Fauxbourg St. Antoine, where I was &s;ud|denly &s;truck with finding my&s;elf under the walls of
<PB N="209" REF="038283_0208_10119751AE028C98">
the Ba&s;tile. A thou&s;and occurrences, relative to that horrible dungeon, crowded them&s;elves in cunfu&s;ion into my mind, and I voluntarily fixed my eyes on the mighty fabric; it was to me like the ba&s;ili&s;k, and I was like the bird <Q><L>Which when its eye</L>
<L>By the guileful &s;nake's keen glances caught,</L>
<L>Flutters, and flutters round, and &s;till would fain</L>
<L>Avert by &s;peedy flight th' impending &s;troke;</L>
<L>Yet &s;till it looks, &s;till drinks the deadly bane,</L>
<L>'Till quite intoxicated by the draught,</L>
<L>It &s;inks, and &s;inks, and &s;en&s;ele&s;s drops at la&s;t</L>
<L>Within the mon&s;ter's wide extended jaws.</L></Q></P>
<P>So my eyes once attracted by the fabric of de&s;po|ti&s;m, could not turn a&s;ide from it:&mdash;there they re|mained immoveably fixed, till, like the poor bird, I dropped into the mouth of the fell mon&s;ter; for I was only rou&s;ed from my lethargy, by finding my|&s;elf &s;eized on by two men, and without any ceremony hurried within the walls I had been contemplating, and given in charge to the governor, to be kept a clo&s;e pri&s;oner, as a dangerous man to the &s;tate. I in vain urged, that I had no ill de&s;ign whatever, and that, at the moment when I offended, I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> as &s;carcely in my &s;en&s;es: all the an&s;wer I could get, was, that I &s;hould &s;oon be brought to my &s;en&s;es there.</P>
<P>Thus, after the many dangers which I had en|countered, the many hours of horrible anxiety, which I had &s;uffered my&s;elf, and which I had occa&s;ioned to others, I was, at la&s;t, likely to end my &s;orrowful life in a di&s;mal dungeon, <Q>'My fate unknown, my per&s;on &s;oon forgot.'</Q></P>
<P>For two days I almo&s;t abandoned my&s;elf to de|&s;pair; but, at la&s;t, I rou&s;ed my&s;el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> from it, and be|gan &s;eriou&s;ly to reflect upon the fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">onduct which had brought me i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">o &s;uch a &s;ituati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, into

which I never &s;hould have fallen, had I not given way to a de&s;pondency, which was &s;tealing almo&s;t im|perceptibly upon me. Had I exerted a proper energy, and re&s;i&s;ted every approach of mental debility, though I might not have been perfectly happy, yet I &s;hould have been in a &s;tate of comparative happine&s;s to that, in which I then found my&s;elf, for I &s;hould &s;till have enjoyed the ble&s;&s;ed light of the &s;un, and breathed freely the circumambient air; I &s;hould not have been &s;hut from human &s;ociety, enveloped in 'ever during dark,' and been buried alive within impenetrable ma&s;&s;es of &s;tone.</P>
<P>The&s;e, and various &s;uch reflections, occupied me, and helped to wear away the di&s;mal &s;olitude in which I found my&s;elf, and to compo&s;e my mind into a &s;ettled calm; that mind, which was the only comfort the ingenious malice of my per&s;ecutors could not deprive me of, and which daily grew &s;tronger and &s;tronger, and enabled me, finally, to &s;truggle, through a &s;tate of exi&s;tence, which I am convinced is the mo&s;t irk|&s;ome that a man can be placed in, that of total inac|tivity; for after having experienced the hard&s;hips of a &s;lavery, which, though my ma&s;ter was a comparatively lenient one, was pretty &s;evere, and tho&s;e of a &s;olitary confinement, I he&s;itate not to affirm, that &s;lavery is even le&s;s galling than the horrible vacuity experienced by tho&s;e, who were confined in that dungeon of de&s;|poti&s;m to which I was condemned.</P>
<P>After I had collected my&s;elf tolerably well, and brought my mind into a &s;ettled &s;tate, I began to compo&s;e, both in pro&s;e and in poetry; and it was a great amu&s;ement to me to impre&s;s on my mind, and arrange into forms, the ideas, which pre&s;ented them&s;elves; and &s;o much did I do in this way, that I have now a large collection of e&s;&s;ays, poems, &amp;c. which I formed in my mind during that time, and have &s;ince put down on paper, which hereafter, Horatia, you may, perhaps, like to look <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ver.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="038283_0210_101197588F714328">But after a while I met with a companion, which proved a great comfort to me; you will &s;mile; but this &s;olace of my &s;olitude, was a little mou&s;e, which, by degrees, I rendered quite familiar. He fir&s;t introduced him&s;elf to me one day, while I was eating my mi&s;erable dinner: any thing alive was a cheering &s;ight to me, and I re&s;olved to cultivate an acquaintance with him, if it was po&s;&s;ible. I threw a few crumbs on the floor of the cell; he at fir&s;t re|treated from them, but afterwards finding that no|thing mole&s;ted him, he advanced and nibbled at them; I can &s;carcely expre&s;s how much I was plea&s;ed to &s;ee him feeding before me; after running about the cell for a while, he at length went away, and I &s;aw no more of him that day; but as I had watched him very narrowly, I &s;aw whither he re|tired, and determined to court his company, by putting &s;ome crumbs near his hole the next morn|ing, when I had my breakfa&s;t; this I accordingly did, and he &s;oon came forth, and eat the mor&s;els I had provided for him, and in return, ran about my cell for &s;ome time. I continued the &s;ame practice for &s;everal days, and he &s;eemed every day to grow le&s;s and le&s;s &s;hy of me; at la&s;t, by dint of con&s;tant encouragement, grew &s;o very familiar that he very &s;eldom left me.</P>
<P>He would, &s;ometimes, run up my leg, and &s;it and eat on my knee, or out of my hand, and then hide him&s;elf in my clothes, and &s;leep there; nor can I expre&s;s how great an affection I contracted for him. I really was as anxious le&s;t he &s;hould be di&s;covered by the people who brought me my food, as if he had been a child; for I knew that if he was, I &s;hould be deprived of his company, and perhaps have endured the painful &s;en&s;ation of &s;eeing him killed before my face, for no other offence than becau&s;e he had amu&s;ed my &s;olitude. I however pre&s;erved him &s;afe through &s;everal 'hair breath e&s;capes,' and at la&s;t brought him in &s;afety away with me. But, poor

<P>I was detained a pri&s;oner there from that time, 'till about eighteen months ago, when an officer came one morning to me, and &s;aid, 'the grand monarque had been graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to allow of my relea&s;e from captivity, provided I would con&s;ent to quit the kingdom immediately, and to be guarded to the port from whence I was to embark.' I was rejoiced to regain my liberty on any terms, and immediately con|&s;ented te the &s;tipularions required. I was accord|ingly let out of my cell, and put under the care of a guard, who had received their orders previous to my appearance, and were now only commanded to proceed with me to the place of my de&s;tination.</P>
<P>Never &s;hall I forget the &s;en&s;ations of tran&s;port which I felt, an he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ring the gates of that accur&s;ed fortre&s;s clo&s;e behind me, and knowing that I was at la&s;t relea&s;ed from the horrible and loath&s;ome con|finement, in which I &s;o long lingered. I was hand-cuffed, and tied by a &s;tring to one of the guards, be|fore I quitted the Ba&s;tile, and thus was I led on, taking pretty long days journeys, 'till we arrived at Rochelle; by which time my feet, which had been for &s;o long a time totally unaccu&s;tomed to walking, were one continual bli&s;ter, and I was &s;o fatigued, that for the la&s;t few miles I could &s;carely get on at all.</P>
<P>On our arrival at Rochelle, I was immediately con&s;igned over to the care of the captain of a St. Do|mingo &s;hip, on board of which I was carried the &s;ame evening, and in two days after we &s;et &s;ail. From the moment when we cleared the coa&s;t of France, I had my perfect liberty, and ingratiated my&s;elf &s;o much with the captain, (who was a polite and benevolent ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uring the voyage, that he made me the kinde&s;t offers of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in &s;eeking my future fortune.</P>
<P><PB N="213" REF="038283_0212_1011975EF98386A8">I told him that my earne&s;t wi&s;h was to get to Li&s;|bon, for I was determined, at all hazards, to go again to St. Marguerite's convent, and by an imme|diate application to the lady abbe&s;s, get my doubts at once re&s;olved. But, as I did not like to communi|cate this de&s;ign, I determined, if po&s;&s;ible, to get to Li&s;bon, from whence I would take a pa&s;&s;age once more to Mar&s;eilles. On our arrival at St. Domingo, therefore, the captain, as the be&s;t means of promot|ing my plan, procured me a pa&s;&s;age to the Portugue&s;e &s;ettlement of Rio Janeiro, on the coa&s;t of Brazil, at which place I &s;hould have frequent opportunities of making my way to Li&s;bon.</P>
<P>The captain, at my departure, tru&s;ted me with a &s;um of money, and letters of credit on a corre&s;pon|dent of his at Li&s;bon, which would enable me to take up a &s;ufficient &s;um to la&s;t me till I got b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k to my own country, I having acquainted him who I was, and told him, that after I had &s;ettled &s;ome af|fairs at Li&s;bon, and at &s;ome other places, which I wi&s;hed to vi&s;it, I &s;hould return to Ireland.</P>
<P>I made many warm acknowledgments for this kindne&s;s, and at fir&s;t indeed he&s;itated to accept it; for I thought it almo&s;t too great a confidence for him to repo&s;e in me, as I had &s;till many hazards to en|counter, and might not at la&s;t, arrive &s;afe at home; in which ca&s;e he would lo&s;e all that his genero&s;ity had entru&s;ted to me. But he would hardly li&s;ten to what I urged, telling me that he had the fulle&s;t con|fidence that I &s;hould repay him, if it was in my power; and even if he were certain that he &s;hould lo&s;e every farthing, he &s;hould think him&s;elf criminal in a ca&s;e like mine, to with-hold his a&s;&s;i&s;tance from me, from paltry motives of &s;elf-intere&s;t. I own I parted from this man with regret, but we parted with a mutual agreement, to keep up a corre&s;pon|dence, if I ever arrived in Ireland, and that he would, if po&s;&s;ible, one day come and vi&s;it me there.</P>
<P>I arrived at Rio Janeiro without any interruption,
<PB N="214" REF="038283_0213_101197608C15DF40">
but there I was unfortunately detained a con&s;iderable time. One day as I &s;at by the &s;ea-&s;ide, when it was pretty rough, and I &s;aw &s;everal ve&s;&s;els to&s;&s;ed about by the waves, and labouring very hard, I was touched by the &s;en&s;e of the dangers they were at that moment encountering; dangers which I had more than ta&s;ted, for I had even drank deeply of them; and I could not help running a parallel in my mind, between the dif|ferent &s;en&s;ations felt at the contemplation of calami|ties ari&s;ing from natural cau&s;es, and of tho&s;e ari&s;ing from moral cau&s;es.</P>
<P>At length I quitted Rio Janeiro, and after a pro&s;|perous voyage, arrived at Li&s;bon. But there I heard &s;uch dreadful accounts of the depredations of the Al|gerines in the Mediterranean, that I was re&s;olved not to run the hazard of falling again into their hands, and I, therefore, determined rather to traver&s;e Spain and cro&s;s the Pyrenean mountains, although I mu&s;t then run the hazard of going over a larger part of the French territories, than if I went by &s;ea to Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|&s;ei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es; but &s;till I thought this the le&s;s dangerous expe|riment of the two; and to return to Ireland without going fir&s;t to St. Marguerite, was what I could not bear even to think of.</P>
<P>Having purcha&s;ed a mule, therefore, I &s;et forwards on my journey; but, after a while, I parted with my bea&s;t again, for I found my&s;elf reluctant to make the animal to great a &s;harer in my fatigues; and yet I knew not how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o allow time to re&s;t him; and I there|fore proceeded on foot, and at la&s;t, after enduring g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eat fatigues, arrived at the place of my de&s;tination.</P>
<P>I immediately de&s;ired to be permitted to &s;peak to the lady abbe&s;s, who received me very courteou&s;ly, and to whom I immediately laid open my &s;tory, and my errand, in the mo&s;t unre&s;erved manner; for I had &s;uffered enough from re&s;erve, to be warned again&s;t ever practi&s;ing it again.</P>
<P>In return to my enquiries concerning the fate of Antoinette, &s;he told me, 'that &s;he died within a

few hours after the birth of her child: that before her death, but when &s;he found it was fa&s;t approaching, &s;he de&s;ired Marianne to communicate to her (the lady abbe&s;s) under a &s;trict injunction of &s;ecrecy, the &s;tory of her marriage, and of the birth of her child, and to entreat her to come to her bed&s;ide, for &s;he wi&s;hed to &s;ay &s;omething to her before &s;he expired.</P>
<P>'When I went to her, &s;ir,' continued the lady ab|be&s;s, &s;he begged my pardon earne&s;tly for her con|duct, &s;ince &s;he had been in the convent, which &s;he &s;aid reflection had convinced her had been wrong;&mdash; &s;he told me how &s;he had di&s;po&s;ed of her child, and de&s;ired, that when &s;uch a time had elap&s;ed, as was likely to have placed the child out of her father's reach, I would tell him the &s;tory of her marriage, and of the birth and di&s;po&s;al of her child; for me &s;aid, &s;he was well convinced that her father had no idea either of her marriage, or of the &s;ituation &s;he was in, when &s;he la&s;t parted from him; and &s;he ended her di&s;cour&s;e with de&s;iring that &s;he might be buried in the convent. All that &s;he thus reque&s;ted, &s;ir,' continued the abbe&s;s, 'I have punctually fulfilled. The baron came to the chateau about three weeks after the death of his daughter, when I communi|cated to him her death, and what &s;he had on her death-bed de&s;ired me to impart to him.</P>
<P>'The baron was violently incen&s;ed at hearing the &s;tory, venting the mo&s;t bitter execretions again&s;t that vile Iri&s;hman who had thus &s;educed his dauhter, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd laying all her re&s;i&s;tance to him, upon the arts which her hu&s;band had practi&s;ed, to alienate her affections from him; and perhaps, &s;ir,' &s;aid the ab|be&s;s, 'it is to that rage of the baron's, that you owe the letter which has co&s;t you &s;o much trouble; for Marianne, I am convinced, could not be the writer of it.

<P>Thus was I at la&s;t &s;atisfied of the truth, with regard to an affair which had kept me in a continued &s;tate of agitation, in a greater or le&s;s degree, for fifteen years. I inquired of the abbe&s;s, if Antoinette was buried in the convent, and &s;he told me, 'that her body was depo&s;ited, according to her de&s;ire, in the chapel of the convent; and,' &s;aid the abbe&s;s, 'from com|pa&s;&s;ion for her &s;ufferings, and a love for her virtues, I was tempted, at my own expence, to erect a &s;mall monument to her memory.'</P>

to accompany me to Ireland, as their te&s;timonies might be of importance to me in the &s;uit which I had told them was impending. I wi&s;hed to have engaged them to &s;ettle in Ireland, but of that they would not give me any expectation; they &s;aid they were happy in their own &s;ituation; their means, it was true, were &s;mall, but they were contented with their &s;ituation, for they were free; 'And after the lives we have formerly led,' &s;aid Clement, 'to be free is every thing; for, if freedom is &s;weet to tho&s;e who have never known any other &s;tate, how much more to us, who were, for &s;o many years, held in a &s;er|vile bondage; in a bondage of the very wor&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ind too, the bondage of the mind!'</P>
<P>We con&s;ulted about the be&s;t means of getting to Ireland, and, at la&s;t, agreed to go by land to Ge|noa; from thence to make a coa&s;ting voyage to Bar|celona, then cro&s;&s;ing the kingdoms of Navarre and Arragon, to go to Bilboa, where we could take &s;hip|ping for Ireland. This route, tedious in it&s;elf, has proved doubly &s;o to us, for we have, in one way or other, met with endle&s;s delays; but, thanks to that power which rules the univer&s;e! we have at la&s;t got through them all; and now I &s;hall think no more of &s;lavery, impri&s;onment, or di&s;a&s;ters, and look forward to &s;uch &s;cenes of happine&s;s, as in all human calcula|tion, I cannot fail to ta&s;te, &s;urrounded as I am with numerous ble&s;&s;ings; and enjoying, as I do, the fir&s;t of all ble&s;&s;ings, a heart perfectly at ea&s;e.</P>

<P>When lord Arlington cea&s;ed &s;peaking, he ex|claimed,</P>
<P>'Oh! my brother; for as my brother I &s;hall hence forth always con&s;ider you; how &s;everely have you felt the dreadful effects of the ungovernable pa&s;|&s;ions of the baron de St. Foix! Perhaps my Gabrielle
<PB N="219" REF="038283_0218_1011976EA7133450">
was more fortunate, in being the object of her fa|ther's aver&s;ion, than her &s;i&s;ter was in being his fa|vourite; for he never offered to make any objections to Gabrielle's following her own inclinations in the affair of marrying, but &s;eemed to feel the mo&s;t per|fect indifference as to what become of her; but poor Antoinette, whom he profe&s;&s;ed to be extremely fond of, he did not cea&s;e to per&s;ecute, 'till her death re|moved her from his cruelties.'</P>
<P>'Your remark is ju&s;t,' &s;aid lord Arlington: 'it was a fortunate circum&s;tance for any one connected with the baron, to be the object of his aver&s;ion; for, when once he had got &s;uch a one removed from his &s;ight, his aver&s;ion &s;ub&s;ided into indifference, and he neither thought nor cared more about them; but tho&s;e whom he loved, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ince&s;&s;antly per&s;ecuted by him. It was thus, as I have heard from An|toinette, with the barone&s;s her mother, who was compelled to marry the baron again&s;t her inclination, and who really was worn out with his per&s;ecutions, in various ways; though he did appear to he, after his own fa&s;hion, extremely fond of her.'</P>
<P>'And this,' &s;aid Mar&s;ini, 'I am &s;orry to &s;ay, is no very uncommon character, e&s;pecially among&s;t tho&s;e people, who are educated with &s;uch va&s;t ideas of their own importance, as the French noble&s;&s;e are; they think the world ought to be at the mercy of their nod, and like froward children, when any thing cro&s;&s;es them in their way ward humours, they per&s;e|cute every body about them, and could even beat the po&s;t, becau&s;e in their fury they had run their no&s;es again&s;t it. Oh! could &s;uch di&s;tinctions ever be de&s;igned by the Creator of the univer&s;e?&mdash;&s;urely not;&mdash;or if they were, 'tis only to &s;hew mankind the folly and wickedne&s;s of them, that they may ta&s;te, with a higher reli&s;h, the time when they &s;hall exi&s;t no longer.</P>
<P>'Yes,' &s;aid count Carletti, who had hitherto &s;at nearly &s;ilent, 'and how doubly odious does this

peevi&s;h tyranny appear, when exerci&s;ed towards the female &s;ex, who ought to be the rational companions and friends of man, not the wretched &s;laves of their hu&s;band's caprices! and I tru&s;t, that, as rea&s;on pre|vails, in the world, again&s;t its hitherto too &s;ucce&s;sful antagoni&s;ts, error and prejudice, this truth will be better under&s;tood, and, that in future times, among&s;t other reforms in the &s;tate of &s;ociety, the female cha|racter will be formed on &s;uch a model, that women &s;hall be &s;itted to bear that important part in the great &s;cale of creation, for which they were de&s;igned.'</P>
<P>'Amen, amen!' &s;aid lord Arlington, I &s;ay with all my heart: and I hope that the time is not very far di&s;tant, when we &s;hall behold this ameliorated &s;tate of mankind, in its meridian &s;plendour; for the early rays of that &s;un of rea&s;on, which will undoubtedly one day illume mankind, have already begun to ap|pear above the horizon, and we now behold them &s;truggling amid&s;t the &s;urrounding vapours; in which, though they may meet with a long and ob&s;tinate re|&s;i&s;tance, their glory can never quite be ob&s;cured; and we may be well a&s;&s;ured that they will, in time, repel every oppo&s;ition that can be made to them. 'Nor,' &s;aid he, 'let any one pre&s;ume to &s;ay, that the female mind is incapable of the highe&s;t degree of cultivation and improvement; or, if any one &s;hould dare advance &s;uch a thing, I would &s;ay, 'look there, and &s;ilence him at once;' and he ca&s;t a mo&s;t affectinate look at lady Arlington.</P>
<P>She bowed in acknowledgment to the compliment, and was proceeding to make &s;ome remarks on lord Arlington's &s;tory, but he took her hand, and &s;aid,</P>
<P>'Tis a melancholy &s;ubject, my Horatia: let us, therefore, drop it, and henceforward bani&s;h melan|choly from among&s;t us. But,' he added, 'one thing yet remains, to &s;earch the papers left by the old her|mit, who, I think, we mu&s;t all by this time &s;uppo&s;e, will appear to have been the baron de St. Foix. Will you let us &s;ee them, Antoinette?'</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="038283_0220_10119776ABDD2BF8">Antoinette immediately produced them, and gave them to lord Arlington, de&s;iring him to look them over. Lord Arlington unfolded them, and read from the outward cover the&s;e words.</P>
<P>"To you, oh! injured daughter of that child, whom I per&s;ecuted to her grave, are the&s;e pages ad|dre&s;&s;ed, by one who&s;e crimes have not been more heinous, than his &s;ufferings have been grievous, by thy grand-father, Rene baron de S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. Foix. They contain a dreadful le&s;&s;on to all who &s;uffer them&s;elves to be guided by their pa&s;&s;ions. Oh may'&s;t thou never fall into the &s;nares which I had not fortitude enough to re&s;i&s;t, but let rea&s;on be the con&s;tant guide of thy actions, &s;o &s;halt thou live happy, and die contented; &s;o &s;halt thou obtain a &s;eat in that bli&s;sful man&s;ion, into which thy grandfather has never, 'till lately, dared to hope he might ever be received."</P>
<P>The papers contained a particular detail of the hi&s;|tory of the baron and his children; of the death of the chevalier, and of the misfortunes and death of Antoinette; with all the circum&s;tances of the baron's life, &s;ub&s;equent to tho&s;e events. But, as all that the former part of the narrative contained, has been al|ready related, we &s;hall not take it up 'till the time when the lady abbe&s;s communicated to him the death of his daughter. After expre&s;&s;ing, in the mo&s;t em|phatic terms, his di&s;appointment and bitter regret, at the death of his &s;on, which he con&s;idered as the ex|tinction of his family, the next heir to his e&s;tate and title being of &s;o extremely remote a branch, he thus proceeded:</P>
<P>"But heaven, as if determined to pour on me the mo&s;t con&s;uming phials of its wrath, now furni&s;hed me with another &s;ource of &s;orrow. I was &s;carcely re|turned again to my chateau, before I received a me&s;|&s;age from the lady abbe&s;s of St. Marguerite's convent, to &s;ay, that &s;he wi&s;hed to &s;ee me on an affair which very nearly concerned me."</P>
<P>Then followed a particular detail of his interview
<PB N="222" REF="038283_0221_1011977843733978">
with the abbe&s;s, together with &s;ome other circum|&s;tances already known; and then he went on to thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> effect:</P>
<P>"All my anger again&s;t my poor child, being thus buried in the g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ave with her pa&s;&s;ion, that all-&s;waying inmate of my bo&s;om, immediately &s;ought out ano|ther object, on which it might vent it&s;elf, and I now conceived mr. Percival alone, to be the guilty per&s;on; that he alone had &s;educed my daughter from her duty, and that if it had not been for him, &s;he would never have made any oppo&s;ition to the marriage which I propo&s;ed to her; and her own life, and her bro|ther's, might thus have been &s;pared.</P>
<P>"The&s;e &s;entiments were continually working in my mind; they followed me every where by day;&mdash; I brooded over them on my pillow at night; if I to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> up a book, I could read nothing but the villany of mr. Percival;&mdash;if I walked out, I &s;aw him in every path, in every alloy, walking with my daughter, and pouring into her ears the poi&s;on of his honied ac|cents:&mdash;'till wrought up at la&s;t to a degree of phrenzy, I re&s;olved never to re&s;t 'till I had executed &s;ome dreadful revenge on him, for the wrongs which I thought he had done me.</P>
<P>"I laid various &s;chemes for this purpo&s;e, but they were all by turns, rejected; yet &s;till I was plan|ning new ones; and the new ones, after dwelling on them a while, were then thrown a&s;ide too; but, at la&s;t, an opportunity of revenge pre&s;ented it&s;elf, which for malice, exceeded my mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes, and I eagerly caught at it. I was walking about the gar|dens very early one morning, having left my bed at that time, tired with a &s;leeple&s;s night, and &s;eeking, if I could, to walls away from my&s;elf, when I overheard two people in earne&s;t conver&s;ation, and looking round, &s;aw that they were &s;eated on a bench pretty near me. I approached them without their perceiving me, as their backs were turned towards me; and almo&s;t without knowing why I did it, I placed my&s;elf in a
<PB N="223" REF="038283_0222_10119779F996D410">
&s;ituation<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, where I could overhear&punc;" they &s;aid&punc; without the lea&s;t danger of their perceiving me.</P>
<P>"I found that one of them was the porter of the ca&s;tle, and the other was the uncle of his daughter's hu&s;band. The former was reading a letter to the latter; and from the letter, and their &s;ub&s;equent con|ver&s;ation, I collected, that the porter's daughter had been entru&s;ted with the care of my little grand|daughter, and was with her in Ireland, at a hou&s;e not far from that in which Theodore lived with his father; and that &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e the death of An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">te, Theo|dore had, purely to oblige his father, married a wo|man of large fortune in the neighbourhood; but that he &s;eemed very unhappy, and &s;till bitterly lamented the death of Antoinette, and often le&s;s his wife, to come and weep over his little daughter, whom he talked of introducing into the family very &s;oon. The conference of the&s;e two people ended in the porter's telling his companion, that he &s;hould very &s;oon &s;end a parcel to his daughter in Ireland.</P>
<P>"This was enough for me; I &s;aw plainly how I could wound the object of my malice and revenge, in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible part; and I immediately wrote that letter, which, as I have found &s;ince I have been in the&s;e parts, did even more mi&s;chief than I could have dared to hope for; then di&s;gui&s;ing my&s;elf like a pea|&s;ant, I carried it to the porter, and told him it came from a per&s;on in the convent, who de&s;ired that he would enclo&s;e it to his daughter."</P>
<P>Here lord Arlington, who was reading the narra|tive, pau&s;ed.</P>
<P>"Alas!" &s;aid he, "Then ab&s;ence was not always a curb to the baron's re&s;entment; for, though I was far removed from him, I was not therefore at all le&s;s the object of his implacable per&s;ecution.&mdash;But I beg pardon for this interruption;" and then he proceeded, and read as follows:</P>
<P>"But the wickedne&s;s I had been guilty of was &s;oon followed by the mo&s;t poignant remor&s;e. Oh!
<PB N="224" REF="038283_0223_1011977F82082058">
never let the angry man hope to derive real &s;atisfac|tion from the gratification of his di&s;tempered feelings; a momentary fla&s;h of &s;omething like plea&s;ure which dazzles his mind, may glance like lightning over it; &mdash;but like lightning, while it excites admiration, it &s;corches; and when the flame that dazzled us is pa&s;t, nought but angui&s;h is left behind.</P>
<P>Such was truly my ca&s;e; con&s;cience &s;oon &s;pake to my &s;oul; not in gentle whi&s;pers, but in the loude&s;t thunder, that I was one of the blacke&s;t of villains; that the murder of my daughter was a deed of inno|cence, when compared with the more cruel &s;tab, which I had now given her hu&s;band; a &s;tab, which would perhaps make him die a lingering death, in the mo&s;t dreadful agonies. I grew hateful to my|&s;elf; &s;olitude was a torment to me, and in &s;ociety I was re&s;tle&s;s and mi&s;erable. I dreaded the approach of night, for my bed was hell it&s;elf to me. If wea|ried nature ever &s;unk me into a &s;lumber, hideous phantoms &s;eemed to flit before my eyes:&mdash;&s;ometimes I &s;aw Theodore writhing in torments, and the gho&s;t of my Antoinette looking on, and upbraiding me for my cruelty:&mdash;when &s;tarting, I woke with a hideous &s;hriek. At other times, I thought the day of judg|ment was arrived, and I &s;tood before the throne of my offended God, when my three children appeared as my accu&s;ers; my &s;on, with the blood &s;treaming from his wounded brea&s;t, and with dripping locks pointing to them, as the effects of my brutal rage;&mdash; and when I awoke, I could hardly believe that the&s;e objects were not really before my eyes. Shame alone prevented me from having &s;omebody to &s;leep in the room with me, for it was mi&s;ery to me to be thus left to my&s;elf. Nor were the&s;e phantoms always confined to my &s;leeping moments for my imagination was &s;ometimes wrought up to &s;o exqui&s;ite a pitch, that I have fancied, as I &s;at by my&s;elf, attempting to read, rather than reading, that I actually &s;aw the form of Theodore before my eyes, pale, gha&s;tly, and expiring

with grief; and have even &s;ummoned my &s;ervants, on the mo&s;t trifling excu&s;e, that my imagination might be relieved with the &s;ight of &s;ome real object. Oh! my child! my child! May I not hope that the&s;e torments have, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, atoned for my &s;ins; for hell cannot have greater torments than I then &s;uffered.</P>
<P>"Almo&s;t worn out with them at la&s;t, a &s;udden thought one day fla&s;hed on my mind, that my mi&s;ery might be relieved by the performance of &s;ome exem|plary penance, which might appea&s;e an angry deity; and from the moment that that idea fir&s;t &s;truck me, I found it a kind of relief to my &s;oul:&mdash;a relief which cannot appear &s;urpri&s;ing, when it is recollected, that the impre&s;&s;ion of one new idea on my mind took it off, in a degree, from the old one, which had &s;o long entirely ab&s;orbed it; and every moment of interval from thinking on that &s;ubject, was to me a moment of comparative ea&s;e.</P>
<P>"I was not long in determining, what the nature of my penance &s;hould be, I re&s;olved to turn as much of my property, as was in my own power, into gold and jewels, which I intended to con&s;ign over to the injured Theodore; and then re&s;igning my e&s;tate to my next heir, to &s;eek a retreat in &s;ome lonely &s;pot; where, by living on roots and water&mdash;by di&s;|ciplining my body, and practi&s;ing all &s;orts of au&s;teri|ties, I might hope to gain a pardon for my &s;oul.</P>
<P>"I immediately &s;ettled all the&s;e affairs; I &s;ent the deeds of my e&s;tate to the per&s;on who was to inherit it, with notice, that at &s;uch a certain time, he might take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the chateau; and &s;ent round to my tenants, to notify to them, that they were from that time to con&s;ider him as their lord.</P>
<P>"I then went to Paris, taking with me my per|&s;onal property, which though of con&s;iderable value, was now reduced to a &s;mall compa&s;s, and placed it in the hands of a banker there, with a provi&s;ion, that he &s;hould not deliver it up to any one, unle&s;s the
<PB N="226" REF="038283_0225_10119782A8CA2768">
per&s;on who claimed it, &s;hould produce a paper which I then &s;hewed him, and of which I left a counterpart in his hands.&mdash;That paper, my deare&s;t child, you will find among&s;t this roll which I have bequeathed you; and it will put you into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all my property, whenever you choo&s;e to claim it.</P>
<P>"I referred to my&s;elf, however, a picture of my Antoinette, and a &s;plendid cro&s;s, which had been pre&s;ented to my &s;on, for &s;ome &s;ervices he had ren|dered to the court; which cro&s;s he had fortunately left, with &s;ome other things, at the chateau, when he went away with his &s;i&s;ter. Both the&s;e, my dear child, I &s;hall al&s;o con&s;ign to you; Oh that I could my|&s;elf &s;hew thee thy mother's picture 'ere I die?</P>
<P>"With the&s;e, and a &s;mall &s;um of money which I had re&s;erved for my own u&s;e, I came hither, having fir&s;t a&s;&s;umed the garb of an anchoret, which I meant to wear for the re&s;t of my life. I intended, how|ever, before I fixed on the &s;pot for my &s;eclu&s;ion, which I had planned to be among&s;t the Alps, to throw my&s;elf at the feet of the injured Theodore, to make confe&s;&s;ion of my wickedne&s;s, and by inve&s;ting him with my property, to endeavour to make him all the amends in my power for the injury I had done him.</P>
<P>"When I arrived here, I found the &s;ad &s;ituation to which the man, whom I &s;ought for, was reduced: that after ab&s;enting him&s;elf from his family and country for &s;ome years, he had returned to them, in a &s;tate of di&s;traction. Oh God! Oh God! what &s;trokes were the&s;e to me? for I knew my&s;elf the author of all. I determined, however, to fix my abode amid&s;t this romantic &s;cenery, 'till &s;omething more was heard of the unhappy lunatic, or 'till I could &s;ee his daughter. Week after week, month after month, year after year, has however pa&s;&s;ed on, nor can I find that lord Arlington is yet re&s;tored to his family. Often have I anxiou&s;ly enquired of my good friend the prie&s;t, who lives near me, whether
<PB N="227" REF="038283_0226_10119785DE6CA688">
the family were not likely to come to Arlington ca&s;tle: for I &s;hould con&s;ider it as a ble&s;&s;ing indeed to &s;ee my grand-daughter, the child of my Antoinette; but it is a ble&s;&s;ing which I hardly dare to hope for. I tru&s;t, however, that all I have de&s;tined for my wretched &s;on-in-law, and his daughter, will at la&s;t come into the hands of one or other of them, by means of that benevolent man, to whom I am in|debted for a thou&s;and little acts of kindne&s;s and for contributing towards re&s;toring me to that degree of peace I have attained &s;ince I came here.</P>
<P>"When fir&s;t I determined on my &s;eclu&s;ion, I, in my u&s;ual intemperate manner, made a ra&s;h oath, that I never would reveal my &s;tory, and the cau&s;e of my &s;eclu&s;ion, to any one. This oath, though ra&s;hly made, I have &s;trictly ob&s;erved; but in leaving it thus written, for the information of tho&s;e whom it really concerns, I think I can hardly be guilty of violating it; at lea&s;t I think it is a ca&s;e where to break the oath is le&s;s criminal than to conceal the &s;tory. I have now been here &s;even years, I have, at times, found my mind tolerably calm, but at other times it has been a troubled &s;ea, to&s;&s;ed about by a whirlwind of con|tending feelings.</P>
<P>"At length, however, the bright &s;un of hope has dawned upon my &s;oul. The life I had led for the&s;e latter years, has unavoidably thrown me into a train of deep rea&s;oning and reflection;&mdash;occupied by no wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">dly concerns, but &s;uch as were brought on by the attention I have paid to my poor neighbours. I have &s;pent a great deal of time in contemplating the &s;tupendous works of creation daily before my eyes. Every object I behold a&s;&s;ures me, that its creator mu&s;t be a being of the mo&s;t unbounded benevolence.&mdash; Wherefore, then, &s;hould I de&s;pond? Though I have been one of the wor&s;t of &s;inners, yet he knows the &s;incerity of my repentance, and therefore may po&s;|&s;ibly extend the arm of mercy even to me.</P>
<P>"As far as the means which I re&s;erved for my&s;elf
<PB N="228" REF="038283_0227_1011825AB4A1A200">
would permit me, I have a&s;&s;i&s;ted the needy with my pur&s;e; but I have held, as &s;acred, all that I at fir&s;t de&s;tined for haple&s;s Theodore and my grandchild. I have never totally remitted my penances and morti|fications, or my bodily di&s;cipline; for though reflec|tion has convinced me, that to mortify the body can|not really be plea&s;ing to the creator, who wi&s;hes all his creatures to enjoy, with thankfulne&s;s and mode|ration, the thou&s;and, thou&s;and ble&s;&s;ings which he has placed around them, yet as bodily penance had fir&s;t awakened my &s;oul to reflection and repentance, and as I dreaded nothing &s;o much, as a return to the &s;lavery, in which I had formerly lived, to my intem|perate pa&s;&s;ions, I have not dared entirely to remit it, left &s;uch a remi&s;&s;ion might be attended with fatal con&s;equences.</P>
<P>"I do not mean here to recommend to general practice the life I have cho&s;en; I have found it a whole&s;ome phy&s;ic, it is true, but better, far better is it, by keeping from earlie&s;t youth, a &s;trict guard over the pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;ubjecting them entirely to the &s;way of rea&s;on, never to have occa&s;ion to &s;eek our remedy in &s;uch a bitter draught. That virtue is very imper|fect, which can only avoid falling by a cowardly de|&s;ertion of the po&s;t of danger:&mdash;he alone, who amid&s;t &s;urrounding &s;nares and temptations, has pre&s;erved his heart pure and uncorrupted, can be &s;aid to have fought a good fight, and really to de&s;erve the crown of glory which is re&s;erved for him."</P>

<P>YES, &s;urely, exclaimed lord Arlington, as he fi|ni&s;hed reading, "thy &s;ins, unhappy man, will be blotted from heaven's holy archives, and only thy penitence, and latter deeds of charity, will remain enrolled there! Ah! Who can read this narrative, and not &s;hudder at the thoughts of crimes, which could draw &s;uch heavy &s;ufferings in their train!&mdash; How much do I rejoice that his wi&s;h was gratified, and that he at la&s;t &s;aw you, my child, before he died. How affecting mu&s;t the &s;cene have been!"</P>
<P>"It was affecting indeed," &s;aid Antoinette, "ne|ver, never &s;hall I forget it! I have been witne&s;s to affecting &s;cenes &s;ince; our meeting, my father, two

days ago was &s;o; but the dying features of the baron have left an impre&s;&s;ion on my mind, which no lan|guage can de&s;cribe. Neither could language de&s;|cribe the emotions of his &s;oul, which were &s;o deeply painted on his countenance; but though language could do litttle in the de&s;cription, the pencil might do much. Look here, my father," &s;he &s;aid, taking a painting from a clo&s;et in the room, "I have tried from memory to give a &s;ketch of his dying counte|nance: Can you trace in this penitent the features of that baron de St. Foix, whom you knew?"</P>
<P>Lord Arlington looked at the work with a&s;toni&s;h|ment;&mdash;it was the fir&s;t &s;pecimen he had &s;een of his daughter's talents in that way, and it would have been no di&s;grace to the fir&s;t ma&s;ters. He ca&s;t his eyes fir&s;t on the painting, then on Antoinette; "And is it po&s;&s;ible," he &s;aid, "that you can be the arti&s;t who has executed &s;o fini&s;hed a work. Yes, indeed, the&s;e features are the wreck of tho&s;e of the baron de St. Foix; which, when not overclouded with pa&s;&s;ion, had &s;omething commanding in them, and you have given them their full force."</P>
<P>The introduction of this piece, in&s;en&s;ibly turned the conver&s;ation into a different channel from that in which it at fir&s;t began to flow; and the arts having been once introduced, Mar&s;ini, who was &s;o great a proficient in them, had an opportunity of di&s;playing his fine ta&s;te to the greate&s;t advantage, and convinced lord Arlington how great an acqui&s;ition &s;uch a com|panion would be to him.</P>
<P>The next morning mr. Thomas Percival attended on lord Arlington, according to appointment, and re|newing his expre&s;&s;ions of penitence and &s;orrow for his conduct, and his re&s;olutions of reformation, lord Arlington told him, that relying on his &s;incerity, he would do all in his power to &s;erve and a&s;&s;i&s;t him. He gave him a large &s;um of money towards defraying the great expence he had been at in his law-&s;uit, and promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in amending his fortune, if he
<PB N="231" REF="038283_0230_10119795B2E54818">
would go into the mercantile line, in&s;tead of leading a life of idlene&s;s, as he had hitherto done, under the idea, that being a branch of a noble family, he &s;hould degrade him&s;elf by going into trade; thus fooli&s;hly choo&s;ing rather to keep a large family&punc; which he had, in indigent gentility, than to amend their &s;ituations by working him&s;elf, and making them work too.</P>
<P>But his mind was now &s;o wrought upon by the genero&s;ity of lord Arlington's behaviour to him, that he thankfully accepted his propo&s;al, and by his advice, fetched his wife and family from Mar&s;eilles; after which, he was e&s;tabli&s;hed by lord Arlington as a mer|chant at Cork, where, by indu&s;try and frugality, he &s;oon ro&s;e to affluence, and was, in time, enabled, even to di&s;charge all the pecuniary obligations he was under to his truly illu&s;trious relation.</P>
<P>It is now time that we turn our attention to Francis Delaval, who, the readers will &s;carcely need to be informed, had been no unconcerned &s;pectator of the &s;cenes which had been pa&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>He, with his father and &s;i&s;ter&punc; were invited to dine at lord Arlington's the day following the trial; in the cour&s;e of which vi&s;it, Francis took an opportunity of &s;lipping the following jeux d'e&s;prit into the hands of Antoinette, as a memento of his attachment to her.</P>

<P><PB N="232" REF="038283_0231_10119799AAE264C0">Antoinette read&punc; it, and &s;miled. Lord Arlington thought, during the whole of the day, that there &s;eemed to be a good under&s;tanding between them, and &s;aw it with plea&s;ure, as he was much plea&s;ed with that young man. When lady Arlington and he were alone, he hinted to her what he thought he had ob&s;erved; to which &s;he replied, that he was quite in the right, and &s;he only delayed to mention the cir|cum&s;tance to him, 'till he was a little le&s;s hara&s;&s;ed with other concerns, and &s;he doubted not but the bu|&s;ine&s;s would be opened in form very &s;oon, by the Delavals. In this &s;uppo&s;ition &s;he was perfectly right; Francis &s;oon found an opportunity of renewing his &s;uit to Antoinette, who now accepted his propo&s;als without he&s;itation; and when the &s;ubject was men|tioned to lord Arlington, he as readily a&s;&s;ented to the union, and Francis and Antoinette were &s;oon made happy in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of each other.</P>
<P>But before their marriage was concluded, Francis took a journey to Paris, for the purpo&s;e of claiming the property of the baron de St. Foix, which had been &s;o long in the banker's hands there. He un|dertook this journey, as lord Arlington could not him|&s;elf go to Paris; end after he had &s;ettled all affairs in that city, he went, at lord Arlington's de&s;ire, to Ro|chelle, to look for his friendly captain. Him Francis found without difficulty, and having di&s;charged all lord Arlington's obligations to him, and made him, according to his directions, a hand&s;ome compliment be&s;ides, he embarked at Rochelle, and returned in perfect &s;afety to Ireland. He would fain have brought the captain over with him, but he could not &s;pare &s;o much time from his bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>During the ab&s;ence of Francis, count Carletti, the friend of Mar&s;ini, had had &s;uch frequent opportunities of improving an acquaintance with his &s;i&s;ter, which had commenced before Francis &s;et out, that at his return, Carletti de&s;ired him to u&s;e his intere&s;t in for|warding
<PB N="233" REF="038283_0232_1011979B393BBBC0">
the &s;uit which he wi&s;hed to propo&s;e to Caroline; nor did Francis find his &s;i&s;ter at all aver&s;e to receive Carletti as a lover: and his addre&s;&s;es having received the &s;anction of mr. Delaval, the &s;ame day that gave Antoinette to Francis, al&s;o joined the hands of count Carletti and Caroline Delaval.</P>
<P>When the property of the baron de St. Foix came to be examined, it appeared to amount to about fif|teen thou&s;and pounds, to which lord Arlington and mr. Delaval added &s;ufficient to enable Francis and Antoinette to live in even more than affluence, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> profu&s;ion.&mdash;Not in the profu&s;ion of gilded trappings and co&s;tly ornaments, but in that kind of profu&s;e ho&s;|pitality, which while it throws a lu&s;tre over tho&s;e who practi&s;e it, at the &s;ame time deals out comforts and ble&s;&s;ings to thou&s;ands.</P>
<P>Mar&s;ini was al&s;o highly liberal to his dear An|toinette, whom he never cea&s;ed to love as a child. He was &s;carcely ever &s;eparated from her and her hu&s;band; &s;ometimes living in Ireland, at the hou&s;e he had purcha&s;ed near Arlington, and at other times v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ting his own e&s;tate in Tu&s;cany, whither mr. and mrs. Delaval always accompanied him, and where he was al&s;o &s;ometimes vi&s;ited by lord and lady Arlington and their family, which, in time, became numerous; and at his death, which was not till he arrived at an advanced age, he left the principal part of his fortune to Francis and Antoinette.</P>
<P>Henry Percival continued to grow in virtue as he advanced in years, and was in due time married to a very amiable woman, who&s;e worth and beauty were her only fortune.</P>
<P>Doctor Schomberg continued in lord Arlington's family, as an a&s;&s;i&s;tant to lord and lady Arlington, in the education of their children, and was highly be|loved and e&s;teemed by them both.</P>
<P>To conclude.&mdash;Lord and lady Arlington continued to live together many years, ta&s;ting even greater hap|pine&s;s in each other, from the contra&s;t which they
<PB N="234" REF="038283_0233_1011979DB290BB90">
had formerly experienced; e&s;teemed and beloved by all who knew them, and dealing out ble&s;&s;ings all around them; and when death at la&s;t called them to the regions of eternal bli&s;s, they left behind them, in their children, faithful repre&s;entatives of their virtue and happine&s;s.</P>
