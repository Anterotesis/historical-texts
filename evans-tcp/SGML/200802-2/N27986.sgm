<OPENER><SALUTE>FRIENDS AND FELLOW-CITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>CALLED to the unaccu&s;tomed ta&s;k of publicly addre&s;&s;ing you, and led by a regard for the true inter|e&s;ts of this community, I &s;olicit your attention to a few of the reflections, which the event we are a&s;&s;em|bled to commemorate and tho&s;e intere&s;ts are calcu|lated to excite.</P>
<P>The formation of a permanent and well ordered &s;tate of Society, is de&s;ervedly con&s;idered among the highe&s;t objects which can engage the enquiry and exer|tions of mankind. On the exi&s;tence of &s;uch a &s;tate, the individual and the &s;ocial improvement and happi|ne&s;s of man e&s;&s;entially and invariably depend. In that &s;tate only, are the duties re&s;ulting from the various rela|tions which its &s;everal members bear to each other, and which all bear to the whole, clearly under&s;tood and faithfully ob&s;erved. It is this which guarantees the unmole&s;ted enjoyment of property, of liberty, and of life; with the unnumbered ble&s;&s;ings which the&s;e lead in their train. It is this which guards under its pro|tecting
<PB N="6" REF="037292_0003_100CE86C512EF0E8">
wings, tho&s;e religious in&s;titutions formed to &s;hed the mo&s;t benign influence on all the powers and conditions of man&mdash;a&s;&s;imilate him to the character of his maker and &s;ecure the anticipation and the future po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of unmea&s;urable joys. A &s;ociety &s;ecuring the&s;e ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ings, affords a remedy to all the moral, and renders impotent, all the natural evils to which mankind are expo&s;ed; and &s;upplying its vari|ous members with their full mea&s;ure of improvement and of happine&s;s, exhibits, not merely an appearance but in reality, a miniature of Heaven.</P>
<P>To introduce and e&s;tabli&s;h on &s;olid foundations, this &s;tate of &s;ociety, have the labors of the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t of men, in every age, been anxiou&s;ly exerted.&mdash; For this great end, have all the real in&s;tructors of mankind labored, in developing the nature and urg|ing the practice, of the duties re&s;ulting from &s;uch a &s;tate; for enforcing a compliance with the&s;e duties, have government and laws been e&s;tabli&s;hed, and bands unnumbered waded thro' &s;eas of blood, to hurl the proud violaters of them from their &s;eats.</P>
<P>Foremo&s;t in the accompli&s;hment of this all-intere&s;ting object, &s;tands the founder of this wide extended em|pire, the beloved the venerated WASHINGTON, who&s;e departure has called forth the &s;olemnities of this day: At the &s;ound of who&s;e name, ru&s;h into the mind the overwhelming ideas of all that is a&s;toni&s;hing|ly
<PB N="7" REF="037292_0004_100CE86E3A1C24F8">
great, and attractively amiable in the human cha|racter, and all that is exten&s;ively beneficent and god|like in human conduct. A mind of the large&s;t and cleare&s;t perception, improved by indu&s;try and experi|ence unparalleled, concentrating the noble&s;t excellencies of our nature, uniting the tendere&s;t mildne&s;s with firm|ne&s;s immovable, the coole&s;t prudence with invincible and daring fortitude, the mo&s;t commanding dignity with mode&s;ty unequalled, ardent affection for his fa|mily and friends, with unextingui&s;hable love for his country, and benevolence embracing the whole human race, founded on an a&s;&s;emblage of virtues which has adorned and a&s;toni&s;hed the world. The dignity of our nature un&s;tained with its vices and its weakne&s;&s;es, in him &s;hone with unrivalled lu&s;tre. In him, virtue accompanied by the large&s;t intelligence was uniform|ly exhibited in public and in private, in &s;cenes the mo&s;t various, trying and important. In him was it exhibited, diffu&s;ing it&s;elf in beneficence through the world, &s;preading innumerable ble&s;&s;ings through our country, conveyed to every &s;tate and to every town; fo&s;tering the happine&s;s of every family, and &s;hedding on the head of every individual, the dews of a father's ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>Such was the illu&s;trious per&s;onage who&s;e departure has wrung every American heart with angui&s;h, and
<PB N="8" REF="037292_0005_100CE87063DC7738">
calls forth, throughout the world, the bur&s;ting &s;igh from every virtuous bo&s;om&mdash;Such the per&s;onage that founded American freedom, was the pervading &s;oul in the formation and in the guidance of our govern|ment, and in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the happine&s;s and the glory of our empire. When the thunder of war roared round our &s;hores&mdash;when the vengeance of a mo&s;t powerful and incenced foe fla&s;hed its lightnings to bla&s;t our infant bands, with all we held dear, in one common ruin&mdash;when &s;lavery armed with its train of agonies, flew to &s;eize the exi&s;ting and unborn millions of his countrymen for its victims&mdash;&s;trong in love for his country, and leaning on the God of battles, he braved the mighty tempe&s;t, and fought through toils and ho&s;ts unnumbered, our path to victory, independ|ence and peace. Had a mind le&s;s va&s;t, a heart le&s;s &s;ound, an arm le&s;s powerful, a character le&s;s glorious, con&s;tituted our leader&mdash;had le&s;s than WASHING|TON been our chief, the &s;un of victory had never beamed on the American arms&mdash;and this wide extend|ed empire, which, notwith&s;tanding its declen&s;ions, is &s;till the glory of the world and the favorite of heaven, had now been writhing under the la&s;h of a foreign ma&s;ter, or &s;wept away in ruin by that wide-wa&s;ting war which has &s;o long tempe&s;ted the European world. From the&s;e mi&s;eries, from this de&s;truction, victory,
<PB N="9" REF="037292_0006_100CE87252044E00">
guided by his arm, delivered us&mdash;&s;evered the ties which bound us to Europe&mdash;placed us on the high ground of national &s;overeignty, and depo&s;ited in our hands the large&s;t means ever given to man, for attaining to na|tional glory and happine&s;s. A numerous people, in|habiting a wide extent of territory, yielding the rich+e&s;t and mo&s;t various productions, and formed by na|ture for the mo&s;t intimate union&mdash;remote from the broils of Europe&mdash;&s;ubject to no ma&s;ter on earth&mdash; compared with the re&s;t of mankind, &s;ingularly en|lightened and virtuous, and glowing with all the fire of freedom&mdash;&s;uch was our character, &s;uch the &s;itua|tion in which he had placed us, when he withdrew from the field of victory to his favorite retirement, enthroned in the hearts of his country, and crowned with the applau&s;es of an admiring world.</P>
<P>But &s;carcely had the noi&s;e of battle cea&s;ed&mdash;&s;carce|ly had this new-born empire began to ta&s;te the &s;weets of exi&s;tence and rejoice in the beams of peace&mdash; &s;carcely had this illu&s;trious father of his country re&s;t|ed from his toils, when the frenzied &s;pirit of di&s;&s;en|tion bur&s;t forth, and &s;pread among a people thus great and thus greatly ble&s;&s;ed, with rapid and deadly progre&s;s. In the &s;hort period of time which elap&s;ed from the commencement of peace to the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment
<PB N="10" REF="037292_0007_100CD6F235F39988">
of our pre&s;ent con&s;titution of government&punc; were the baleful effects of this &s;pirit deeply and widely ex|perienced. A de&s;truction of public and private con|fidence&mdash;a general pro&s;tration of morals&mdash;convul&s;ions which &s;hook the fir&s;t &s;tates of the Union to their cen|tre&mdash;the bands of our union and government di&s;&s;olv|ing, and all our deare&s;t intere&s;ts ha&s;tening to their extinction, were the exi&s;ting effects of this di&s;&s;en|tion&mdash;effects rapidly plunging us into complete wretch|edne&s;s among our&s;elves, and &s;inking our name into a proverb, a hi&s;&s;ing, and a bye-word through the world.</P>
<P>Let us, without prejudice, more minutely examine this &s;pirit of di&s;&s;ention, not as exi&s;ting in this or that particular party, but as invariably exi&s;ting in all par|ties. Has it not the mo&s;t malignant influence on the individual, as well as the national character and hap|pine&s;s of man? Warping and contracting his mind by invincible prejudices, does it not incapaciate him for the perception of truth, and lead him to embrace for truth the wilde&s;t and mo&s;t ruinous errors? Lead him to approve and &s;upport as right all the acts of his party, however wrong and de&s;tructive? To condemn, to thwart every oppo&s;ite act, however advantageous and important? Does not this &s;pirit empoi&s;on the
<PB N="11" REF="037292_0008_100CE8768B939F80">
noble&s;t affections of his heart? In&s;tead of in&s;piring him with love to his neighbours and exciting endea|vors for their happine&s;s, does it not lead him to regard and &s;ecretly to treat them, if not of his party, as his declared enemies, the enemies of his country and of human happine&s;s? To mi&s;repre&s;ent their be&s;t actions, or attribute them to the vile&s;t of motives. Do not the&s;e feelings and practices, cheri&s;hed by indulgence and &s;trengthened by habit, generate in his heart, the fell &s;pirit of revenge as the &s;ettled principle of his conduct towards them? Infuriated by this pa&s;&s;ion, what but want of power re&s;trains him from plunging the dagger of death into their bo&s;oms?</P>
<P>To what lengths had this di&s;&s;ention carried us, had not the e&s;tabli&s;hment of our pre&s;ent government re|&s;trained its career? What had been our condition, as a &s;tate, compo&s;ed of &s;uch individuals, of &s;uch feinds as its members? What our condition as a combina|tion of &s;tates, with their &s;everal legi&s;latures frenzied with the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions and armed with power to wreak the full force of them upon the property, peace, happine&s;s, and exi&s;tence of each other? Had not our victory over a foreign foe been wor&s;e than death? Our Independence, if it could, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, have exi&s;ted, wor&s;e than the heavie&s;t foreign bondage?
<PB N="12" REF="037292_0009_100CE8782554D2E0">
Had not our liberty, transformed to anarchy, proved the deadlie&s;t cur&s;e heaven could inflict? Had it not pro&s;trated our national &s;overeignty with all our darling privileges at the feet of the fir&s;t foreign invader? Or deluged this country in the blood of her &s;ons, &s;tream|ing from the murderous hands of each other?</P>
<P>To re&s;cue us from this gulph into which we were then rapidly precipitating our&s;elves, the impre&s;&s;|ive example, the comprehen&s;ive wi&s;dom, the all com|manding love of WASHINGTON, &s;trengthened by his enlightened and virtuous compatriots, were called forth into the mo&s;t anxious and vigorous exertions. By the&s;e exertions were the intere&s;ting principles on which our individual and national exi&s;tence and happine&s;s invariably depend, unfolded and e&s;tabli&s;hed in our minds. By the&s;e exertions, was brought home to our bo&s;oms, an irre&s;i&s;tible conviction of the nece&s;&s;ity of burying our di&s;&s;entions, of uniting every heart, of bracing every arm in the e&s;tabli&s;hment and &s;upport of an energetic government; a government commen&s;u|rate to the extent of the territory, the foreign and internal relations, and the character of the people, of our country. Was not the nece&s;&s;ity of this govern|ment evidenced by the highe&s;t authorities, and its adoption and &s;upport, urged by every con&s;ideration mo&s;t intere&s;ting to the human mind? Had not the word of God, the experience of ages, and our then
<PB N="13" REF="037292_0010_100CE87A3A3E2030">
affecting experience demon&s;trated &s;uch imperfection in men, as evinced that they have not as individuals &s;uffi|cient knowledge to di&s;cern, much le&s;s &s;ufficient virtue voluntarily to practice the duties which they owe to each other, and to the community of which they are members? Had not the &s;ame authorities and the &s;tronge&s;t dictates of rea&s;on equally demon&s;trated that &s;ociety cannot exi&s;t in any &s;tate, much le&s;s, in an im|proved and happy &s;tate, if the&s;e duties are unknown, or when known, violated and contemned. That there|fore a government po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of wi&s;dom to unfold the&s;e duties in its laws, and of power &s;ufficient to enforce the ob&s;ervance of them, becomes indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ocial exi&s;tence and happine&s;s. That the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uch a government mu&s;t invariably continue, until the propen&s;ities to vice are annihilated, by a general re|novation of the human character; and that every pro|ject for le&s;&s;ening the coercive power of this government, and of encrea&s;ing the individual liberty of a people, not founded on that renovation of character as its ba&s;is, is vi&s;ionary and de&s;tructive?</P>
<P>To unite and animate our exertions in the formation of a government of this de&s;cription, calculated to &s;ave us equally as individuals and as a people, from ruin, and to &s;ecure to us all the intere&s;ts mo&s;t dear to our hearts, did this illu&s;trious character, not le&s;s our pre|&s;erver than deliverer, &s;econded by his enlightened and

virtuous a&s;&s;ociates, call up to our view every con&s;ider|ation mo&s;t intere&s;ting and important&mdash;That if we va|lued that victory, for which our fathers, our brethren, and our&s;elves had toiled and bled&mdash;and if we valued our Independence, the ine&s;timable fruit of that victory; if we valued the full tide of ble&s;&s;ings which nature and art were pouring in upon us; if we valued the real enjoyment of that liberty which we held mo&s;t dear&mdash; if we valued our religious in&s;titutions, the highe&s;t ble&s;&s;ings heaven could confer, and which were equally with every other mean of our happine&s;s, &s;inking in the general wreck of our country, the&s;e immen&s;e con&s;id|erations called on us to pluck the &s;pirit of di&s;cord from our bo&s;oms, &s;heath the &s;word of party, bani&s;h jealou|&s;ies, unite as a band of brothers, and, by a vigorous exertion, erect a government in&s;pired with wi&s;dom, and clothed with power, to &s;ave, extend, and perpe|tuate the happine&s;s, the greatne&s;s and the glory of our empire.</P>
<P>On that union, on that exertion, the goodly frame of our government, under his forming hand, aided by the wi&s;e and virtuous of our country, and favoured by Heaven, has ari&s;en; has been upheld, adorned and e&s;tabli&s;hed, amid the unexampled convul&s;ions which are rending the civilized world, &s;till &s;hields us in &s;afe|ty and in happine&s;s; and, unle&s;s we betray our&s;elves and po&s;terity, will &s;tand the admiration and ble&s;&s;ing of future ages.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="037292_0012_100CE87EF6233508">Do we weep that the feet of our WASHINGTON, the leading procurer of the&s;e ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ings, have &s;tumbled on the dark mountains of death? Does grief for our lo&s;s rend our bo&s;oms? Are gratitude, venera|tion, and love for his character and &s;ervices deep en|graven on our hearts? Let us evidence the&s;e &s;enti|ments, not by idle tears, but by imitating the impre&s;&s;|ive example which he has left us, and improving the ble&s;&s;ing be&s;towed. Let us practice as far as our circle extends, the virtues which &s;hone with &s;uch lu&s;tre and beneficence in him. Let us bear in mind, that every motive which has been &s;ugge&s;ted, for extirpating di&s;|cord, &s;trengthening the bands of our union, and up|holding our government, applies with redoubled force, to our&s;elves in particular. Let us eradicate from our hearts and our conduct, that vile &s;pirit of party, for which we have become proverbial. Let us cheri&s;h the harmonizing principle of benevolence towards each other, an unqualified love for our country, a veneration and love for our invaluable civil and religious in&s;titu|tions, and a readine&s;s to devote our obedience, our ta|lents, our fortunes, and our lives, for their &s;upport.</P>
