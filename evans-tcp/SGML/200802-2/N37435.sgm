<HEAD>SERMON I. The Ju&s;tice of God in the Damnation of Sinners.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>ROM. iii.19.</HI></BIBL>
<P>&mdash;That every mouth may be &s;topped.&mdash;</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE main &s;ubject of the doctrinal part of this epi&s;tle, is the free grace of God in the &s;alvation of men by Je&s;us Chri&s;t; e&s;pecially as it appears in the doctrine of ju&s;tification by faith alone. And the more clearly to evince this doc|trine, and &s;hew the rea&s;on of it, the apo&s;|tle, in the fir&s;t place, e&s;tabli&s;hes that point, that no fle&s;h living can be ju&s;tified by the deeds of the law. And to prove it, he is very large and particular in &s;hewing, that all mankind, not only Gentiles but Jews, are under &s;in, and &s;o under the condemna|tion of the law; which is what he in&s;i&s;ts upon from the beginning of the epi&s;tle to this place. He fir&s;t begins with the Gen|tiles; and in the fir&s;t chapter &s;hews that they are under &s;in, by &s;etting forth the ex|ceeding corruptions and horrid wicked|ne&s;s that over&s;pread the Gentile world: And then through the &s;econd chapter, and the former part of this third chapter, to
<PB N="4" REF="049067_0003_10264EBA17A204B0">
the text and following ver&s;e, he &s;hews the &s;ame of the Jews, that they al&s;o are in the &s;ame circum&s;tances with the Gentiles in this regard. They had an high thought of them&s;elves, becau&s;e they were God's cov|enant people, and circumci&s;ed, and the children of Abraham. They de&s;pi&s;ed the Gentiles as polluted, condemned, and ac|cur&s;ed; but looked on them&s;elves, on ac|count of their external privileges, and cer|emonial and moral righteou&s;ne&s;s, as a pure and holy people, and the children of God; as the apo&s;tle ob&s;erves in the &s;econd chap|ter. It was therefore &s;trange doctrine to them, that they al&s;o were unclean and guilty in God's &s;ight, and under the con|demnation and cur&s;e of the law. The apo&s;tle does therefore, on account of their &s;trong prejudices again&s;t &s;uch doctrine, the more particularly in&s;i&s;t upon it, and &s;hews that they are no better than the Gentiles; as in the 9th ver&s;e of this chapter, "What then? are we better than they? "No, in no wi&s;e? for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under &s;in." And, to convince them of it, he then produces certain pa&s;&s;ages out of their own law, or the Old Te&s;tament, (who&s;e authority they pretended a great regard to) from the 9th ver&s;e to the ver&s;e wherein is our text. And it may be ob&s;erved, that the apo&s;tle, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> cites certain pa&s;&s;ages to
<PB N="5" REF="049067_0004_10264EBFD4F9E368">
prove that mankind are all corrupt, in the 10th, 11th, and 12th, ver&s;es; "As it is written. There is none righteous, no not one: There is none that under&s;tandeth, there is none that &s;eeketh after God. They are all gone out of the way, they are to|gether become unprofitable, there is none that doth good, no not one." <HI>Secondly,</HI> The pa&s;&s;ages he cites next, are to prove, that not only all are corrupt, but each one wholly corrupt, as it were all over unclean, from the crown of his head to the &s;oles of his feet; and therefore &s;everal particular parts of the body are mentioned, as the throat, the tongue, the lips, the mouth, the feet, ver&s;es, 13.14.15.: "Their throat is an open &s;epulchre: with their tongues they have u&s;ed deceit; the poi&s;on of a&s;ps is under their lips; who&s;e mouth is full of cur&s;ing and bitterne&s;s: Their feet are &s;wift to &s;hed blood." And, <HI>Thirdly,</HI> He quotes other pa&s;&s;ages to &s;hew, that each one is not only all over corrupt, but cor|rupt to a de&s;perate degree, in the 16th, 17th, and 18th ver&s;es; in which the ex|ceeding degree of their corruption is &s;hewn, Both by affirming and denying: By affirm|atively expre&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t pernicious na|ture and tendency of their wickedne&s;s, in the 16th ver&s;e: "De&s;truction and mi&s;ery are in their ways." And ther by denying all good or godline&s;s of them, in the 17th
<PB N="6" REF="049067_0005_10264EC15D048B08">
and 18th ver&s;es, "And the way of peace have they not known: There is no fear of God before their eyes." And then, le&s;t the Jews &s;hould think the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages of their law do not concern them, and that only the Gentiles are intended in them, the apo&s;tle &s;hews in the ver&s;e of the text, not only that they are not exempt, but that they e&s;pecially mu&s;t be under&s;tood: "Now we know that what&s;oever things the law &s;aith, it &s;aith to them who are under the law." By tho&s;e that are under the law is meant the Jews; and the Gentiles by tho&s;e that are without law; as appears by the 18th ver&s;e of the preceding chapter. There is &s;pecial rea&s;on to under&s;tand the law, as &s;peaking to and of them, to whom it was immediately given. And therefore the Jews would be unrea&s;onable in ex|empting them&s;elves. And if we examine the places of the Old Te&s;tament whence the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages are taken, we &s;hall &s;ee plain|ly that &s;pecial re&s;pect is had to the wicked|ne&s;s of the people of that nation, in every one of them. So that the law &s;huts all up in univer&s;al and de&s;perate wickedne&s;s, <HI>that every mouth may be &s;topp<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">d;</HI> the mouths of the Jews, as well as of the Gentiles, notwith&s;tanding all tho&s;e privileges by which they were di&s;tingui&s;hed from the Gentiles.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="049067_0006_10264EC32658A680">The things that the law &s;ays, are &s;ufficient to &s;top the mouths of all mankind, in two re&s;pects.</P>
<P N="1">1. To &s;top them from boa&s;ting of their righteou&s;ne&s;s, as the Jews were wont to do; as the apo&s;tle ob&s;erves in the 23d ver&s;e of the preceding chapter.&mdash;That the apo&s;tle has re&s;pect to &s;topping their mouths in this re&s;pect, appears by the 27th ver&s;e of the context, "Where is boa&s;ting then? It is excluded." The law &s;tops our mouths from making of any plea for life, or the favour of God, or any po&s;itive good, from our own righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. To &s;top them from making any ex|cu&s;e for our&s;elves or objection again&s;t the execution of the &s;entence of the law, or the infliction of the puni&s;hment that it threatens. That this is intended, appears by the words immediately following, "That all the world may become guilty before God." That is, that they may appear to be guilty, and &s;tand convicted before God, and ju&s;tly liable to the condemnation of his law, as guilty of death, according to the Jewi&s;h way of &s;peaking.</P>
<P>And thus the apo&s;tle proves, that no fle&s;h can be ju&s;tified in God's &s;ight by the deeds of the law; as he draws the conclu|&s;ion in the following ver&s;e; and &s;o pre|pares the way for the e&s;tabli&s;hing of the great doctrine of ju&s;tification by faith alone,
<PB N="8" REF="049067_0007_10264EC716AC4A70">
which he proceeds to do in the next ver&s;e to that, and in the following part of the chapter, and of the epi&s;tle.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE.</HEAD>
<P>"It is ju&s;t with God eternally to ca&s;t off and de&s;troy &s;inners."</P>
<P>&mdash;For this is the puni&s;hment which the law condemns to; which the things that the law &s;ays, may well &s;top every mouth from all manner of objection a|gain&s;t.</P>
<P>The truth of this doctrine may appear by the joint con&s;ideration of two things, viz. Man's &s;infulne&s;s, and God's &s;overeign|ty.</P>
<P N="1">I. It appears from the con&s;ideration of man's &s;infulne&s;s. And that whether we con&s;ider the infinitely evil nature of all &s;in, or how much &s;in men are guilty of.</P>
<P N="1">1. If we con&s;ider the infinite evil and heinou&s;ne&s;s of &s;in in general, it is not un|ju&s;t in God to inflict what puni&s;hment is de&s;erved; becau&s;e the very notion of de|&s;erving any puni&s;hment is, that it may be ju&s;tly inflicted: A de&s;erved puni&s;hment and a ju&s;t puni&s;hment are the &s;ame thing. To &s;ay that one de&s;erves &s;uch a puni&s;h|ment, and yet to &s;ay that he does not ju&s;t|ly de&s;erve it, is a contradiction; and if he ju&s;tly de&s;erves it; then it may be ju&s;tly in|flicted.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="049067_0008_10264EC9F8D06348">Every crime or fault de&s;erves a greater or le&s;&s;er puni&s;hment, in proportion as the crime it&s;elf is greater or le&s;s. If any fault de&s;erves puni&s;hment, then &s;o much the greater the fault, &s;o much the greater is the puni&s;hment de&s;erved. The faulty na|ture of any thing is the formal ground and rea&s;on of its de&s;ert of puni&s;hment; and therefore the more any thing hath of this nature, the more puni&s;hment it de&s;erves. And therefore the terriblene&s;s of the de|gree of puni&s;hment, let it be never &s;o ter|rible, is no argument again&s;t the ju&s;tice of it, if the proportion does but hold between the heinou&s;ne&s;s of the crime and the dread|fulne&s;s of the puni&s;hment; &s;o that if there be any &s;uch thing as a fault infinitely heinous, it will follow that it is ju&s;t to in|flict a puni&s;hment for it that is infinitely dreadful.</P>
<P>A crime is more or le&s;s heinous, accord|ing as we are under greater or le&s;&s;er obli|gations to the contrary. This is &s;elf-evi|dent; becau&s;e it is herein that the crimi|nalne&s;s or faultine&s;s of any thing con&s;i&s;ts, that it is contrary to what we are obliged or bound to, or what ought to be in us. So the faultine&s;s of one being's hating another, is in proportion to his obligation to love him. The crime of one being's de&s;pi&s;ing and ca&s;ting contempt on another, is proportionably more or le&s;s heinous, as
<PB N="10" REF="049067_0009_10264ECB83E8D6D8">
he was under greater or le&s;&s;er obligations to honour him. The fault of di&s;obeying another, is greater or le&s;s, as any one is under greater or le&s;&s;er obligations to obey him. And therefore if there be any being that we are under infinite obligations to love, and honour, and obey, the contrary towards him mu&s;t be infinitely faulty.</P>
<P>Our obligation to love, honour, and obey any being, is in proportion to his loveline&s;s, honourablene&s;s, and authority; for that is the very meaning of the words. When we &s;ay any one is very lovely, it is the &s;ame as to &s;ay, that he is one very much to be loved: Or if we &s;ay, &s;uch a one is more honourable than another, the meaning of the words is, that he is one that we are more obliged to honour. If we &s;ay any one has great authority over us, it is the &s;ame as to &s;ay&punc; that he has great right to our &s;ubjection and obedience.</P>
<P>But God is a being infinitely lovely, be|cau&s;e he hath infinite excellency and beau|ty. To have infinite excellency and beau|ty, is the &s;ame thing as to have infinite loveline&s;s. He is a Being of infinite great|ne&s;s, maje&s;ty and glory; and therefore is infinitely honourable. He is infinitely exalted above the greate&s;t potentates of the earth, and highe&s;t angels in heaven; and therefore is infinitely more honourable than they. His authority over us is infi|nite;
<PB N="11" REF="049067_0010_10264ECE0A395710">
and the ground of his right to our obedience is infinitely &s;trong; for he is infinitely worthy to be obeyed in him&s;elf, and we have an ab&s;olute, univer&s;al, and in|finite dependence upon him.</P>
<P>So that &s;in again&s;t God, being a violation of infinite obligations, mu&s;t be a crime in|finitely heinous, and &s;o de&s;erving of infinite puni&s;hment.&mdash;Nothing is more agreeable to the common &s;en&s;e of mankind, than that &s;ins committed again&s;t any one, mu&s;t be proportionably heinous to the dignity of the being offended and abu&s;ed; as it is al&s;o agreeable to the word of God, 1 Sam. ii.25. "If one man &s;in again&s;t another, the judge &s;hall judge him;" (i. e. &s;hall judge him, and inflict a finite puni&s;hment, &s;uch as finite judges can inflict;) "but if a man &s;in again&s;t the Lord, who &s;hall in|treat for him?" This was the aggravation of &s;in that made Jo&s;eph afraid of it, Gen. xxxix.9. "How &s;hall I commit this great wickedne&s;s, and &s;in again&s;t God?" This was the aggravation of David's &s;in, in compari&s;on of which he e&s;teemed all others as nothing, becau&s;e they were in|finitely exceeded by it. P&s;alm li.4. "Again&s;t thee, thee only, have I &s;inned." &mdash;The eternity of the puni&s;hment of un|godly men renders it infinite; and it ren|ders it no more than infinite; and there|fore renders no more than proportionable
<PB N="12" REF="049067_0011_10264ED296E1E130">
to the heinou&s;ne&s;s of what they are guilty of.</P>
<P>If there be any evil or faultine&s;s in &s;in again&s;t God, there is certainly infinite evil: For if it be any fault at all, it has an infi|nite aggravation, viz. that it is again&s;t an infinite object. If it be ever &s;o &s;mall upon other accounts, yet if it be any thing, it has one infinite dimen&s;ion; and &s;o is an infinite evil. Which may be illu&s;trated by this: If we &s;uppo&s;e a thing to have in|finite length, but no breadth and thickne&s;s, but to be only a mere mathematical line, it is nothing: But if it have any breadth and thickne&s;s at all, though never &s;o &s;mall, yet if it have but one infinite dimen&s;ion, viz. that of length, the quantity of it is infinite; it exceeds the quantity of any thing, however broad, thick and long, wherein the&s;e dimen&s;ions are all finite.</P>
<P>So that the objections that are made again&s;t the infinite puni&s;hment of &s;in, from the nece&s;&s;ity, or rather previous cer|tainty of the futurition of &s;in, ari&s;ing from the decree of God, or unavoidable origin|al corruption of nature, if they argue any thing, do not argue again&s;t the infinitene&s;s of the degree of the faultine&s;s of &s;in direct|ly, and no otherwi&s;e than they argue again&s;t any faultine&s;s at all: For if this nece&s;&s;ity or certainty leaves any evil at all in &s;in, that fault mu&s;t be infinite by rea&s;on of the infinite object.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="049067_0012_10264ED51C889C78">But every &s;uch objector as would argue from hence, that there is no fault at all in &s;in, confutes him&s;elf, and &s;hews his own in&s;incerity in his objection. For at the &s;ame time that he objects, that men's acts are nece&s;&s;ary, from God's decrees, and original &s;in, and that this kind of nece&s;&s;ity is incon&s;i&s;tent with faultine&s;s in the act, his own practice &s;hews that he does not believe what he objects to be true: Other|wi&s;e why does he at all blame men? Or why are &s;uch per&s;ons at all di&s;plea&s;ed with men, for abu&s;ive, injurious and ungrateful acts towards them? Whatever they pre|tend, by this they &s;hew that indeed they do believe that there is no nece&s;&s;ity in men's acts, from divine decrees, or cor|ruption of nature, that is incon&s;i&s;tent with blame. And if their objection be this, That this previous certainty is by God's own ordering, and that where God orders an antecedent certainty of acts, he trans|fers all the fault from the actor on him&s;elf; their practice &s;hews, that at the &s;ame time they do not believe this, but fully believe the contrary: For when they are abu&s;ed by men, they are di&s;plea&s;ed with men, and not with God only.</P>
<P>The light of nature teaches all mankind, that when an injury is voluntary, it is faulty, without any manner of con&s;idera|tion of what there might be previou&s;ly to
<PB N="14" REF="049067_0013_10264ED79FA07750">
determine the futurition of that evil act of the will. And it really teaches this as much to tho&s;e that object and cavil mo&s;t as to others; as their univer&s;al practice &s;hews. By which it appears, that &s;uch objections are in&s;incere and perver&s;e. Men will mention others corrupt nature in their own ca&s;e, or when they are injured, as a thing that aggravates their crime, and that wherein their faultine&s;s partly con&s;i&s;ts. How common is it for per&s;ons, when they look on them&s;elves greatly injured by another, to inveigh again&s;t him, and ag|gravate his ba&s;ene&s;s, by &s;aying, "He is a man of a mo&s;t perver&s;e &s;pirit: He is nat|urally of a &s;elfi&s;h, niggardly or proud and haughty temper: He is one of a ba&s;e and vile di&s;po&s;ition." And yet men's natural corrupt di&s;po&s;itions are mentioned as an excu&s;e for them, with re&s;pect to their &s;ins again&s;t God, and as if they rendered them blamele&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. That it is ju&s;t with God eternally to ca&s;t off wicked men, may more abundant|ly appear, if we con&s;ider how much &s;in they are guilty of. From what has been already &s;aid, it appears, that if men were guilty of &s;in but in one particular, that is &s;ufficient ground of their eternal rejection and condemnation: If they are &s;inners, that is enough: Merely this might be &s;uf|ficient to keep them from ever lifting up
<PB N="15" REF="049067_0014_10264EDA2293F590">
their heads, and cau&s;e them to &s;mite on their brea&s;ts, with the publican that cried "God be merciful to me a &s;inner." But &s;inful men are not only thus, but they are full of &s;in; full of principles of &s;in, and full of acts of &s;in: Their guilt is like great mountains, heaped one upon another, till the pile is grown up to heaven. They are totally corrupt, in every part, in all their faculties; and all the principles of their nature, their under&s;tandings, and wills; and in all their di&s;po&s;itions and af|fections, their heads, their hearts, are to|tally depraved; all the members of their bodies are only in&s;truments of &s;in; and all their &s;en&s;es, &s;eeing, healing, ta&s;ting, &amp;c. are only inlets and outlets of &s;in, channels of corruption. There is nothing but &s;in, no good at all. Rom. vii.18. "In me, that is in my fle&s;h, dwells no good thing." There is all manner of wickedne&s;s. There are the &s;eeds of the greate&s;t and blacke&s;t crimes. There are principles of all &s;orts of wickedne&s;s again&s;t men; and there is all wickedne&s;s again&s;t God. There is pride; there is enmity; there is contempt; there is quarrelling; there is Athei&s;m; there is bla&s;phemy. There are the&s;e things in exceeding &s;trength; the heart is under the power of them, is &s;old under &s;in, and is a perfect &s;lave to it. There is hard|heartedne&s;s, hardne&s;s greater than that of
<PB N="16" REF="049067_0015_10264EDCA2EA27F8">
a rock, or an adamant &s;tone. There is ob|&s;tinacy and perver&s;ene&s;s, incorrigiblene&s;s and inflexiblene&s;s in &s;in, that will not be overcome by threatenings or promi&s;es, by awakenings or encouragements, by judg|ments or mercies, neither by that which is terrifying, nor that which is winning: The very blood of God will not win the heart of a wicked man.</P>
<P>And there is actual wickedne&s;&s;es with|out number or mea&s;ure. There are breach|es of every command, in thought, word and deed; a life full of &s;in; days and nights filled up with &s;in; mercies abu&s;ed, and frowns de&s;pi&s;ed; mercy and ju&s;tice, and all the divine perfections, trampled on; and the honour of each per&s;on in the Trinity trod in the dirt. Now if one &s;in|ful word or thought has &s;o much evil in it, as to de&s;erve eternal de&s;truction, how do they de&s;erve to be eternally ca&s;t off and de&s;troyed, that are guilty of &s;o much &s;in!</P>
<P N="2">II. If with man's &s;infulne&s;s, we con&s;id|er God's &s;overeignty, it may &s;erve further to clear God's ju&s;tice in the eternal rejec|tion and condemnation of &s;inners, from men's cavils and objections. I &s;hall not now pretend to determine preci&s;ely, what things are, and what things are not, prop|er acts and exerci&s;es of God's holy &s;over|eignty; but only, that God's &s;overeignty extends to the following things.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="17" REF="049067_0016_10264EDF25C60370">1. That &s;uch is God's &s;overeign power and right, that he is originally under no obligation to keep men from &s;inning; but may in his providence permit and leave them to &s;in. He was not obliged to keep either angels or men from falling. It is unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that God &s;hould be obliged, if he makes a rea&s;onable crea|ture capable of knowing his will, and re|ceiving a law from him, and being &s;ubject to his moral government, at the &s;ame time to make it impo&s;&s;ible for him to &s;in, or break his law. For if God be obliged to this, it de&s;troys all u&s;e of any commands, laws, promi&s;es or threatenings, and the ve|ry notion of any moral government of God over tho&s;e rea&s;onable creatures. For to what purpo&s;e would it be, for God to give &s;uch and &s;uch laws, and declare his holy will to a creature, and annex promi&s;es and threatenings to move him to his duty, and make him careful to perform it, if the creature at the &s;ame time has this to think of, that God is obliged to make it impo&s;&s;i|ble for him to break his laws? How can God's threatenings move to care or watch|fulne&s;s, when, at the &s;ame time, God is o|obliged to render it impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould be expo&s;ed to the threatenings? Or, to what purpo&s;e is it for God to give a law at all? For according to this &s;uppo&s;ition, it is God, and not the creature, that is under

law. It is the lawgivers care, and not the &s;ubjects, to &s;ee that his law is obeyed; and this care is what the lawgiver is ab&s;olute|ly obliged to. If God be obliged never to permit a creature to fall, there is an end of all divine laws, or government, or au|thority of God over the creature; there can be no manner of u&s;e of the&s;e things.</P>
<P>God may permit &s;in, though the being of &s;in will certainly en&s;ue on that permi&s;|&s;ion: And &s;o, by permi&s;&s;ion, he may di&s;|po&s;e and order the event. If there were any &s;uch thing as chance, or mere contin|gence, and the very notion of it did not carry a gro&s;s ab&s;urdity, (as might ea&s;ily be &s;hown that it does), it would have been very unfit, that God &s;hould have left it to mere chance, whether man &s;hould fall or no. For chance, if there &s;hould be any &s;uch thing, is unde&s;igning and blind. And certainly it is more fit that an event of &s;o great importance, and that is attended with &s;uch an infinite train of great con&s;equen|ces, &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed and ordered by in|finite wi&s;dom, than that it &s;hould be left to blind chance.</P>
<P>If it be &s;aid, that God need not have in|terpo&s;ed to render it impo&s;&s;ible for man to &s;in, and yet not leave it to mere contin|gence or blind chance neither; but might have left it with man's free will, to deter|mine whether to &s;in or no: I an&s;wer, if
<PB N="19" REF="049067_0018_10264EE42CC8FF10">
God did leave it to man's free will, with|out any &s;ort of di&s;po&s;al, or ordering in the ca&s;e, whence it &s;hould be previou&s;ly cer|tain how that free will &s;hould determine, then &s;till that fir&s;t determination of the will mu&s;t be merely contingent or by chance. It could not have any antecedent act of the will to determine it; for I &s;peak now of the very fir&s;t act or motion of the will, re&s;pecting the affair that may be look|ed upon as the prime ground and highe&s;t &s;ource of the event. To &s;uppo&s;e this to be determined by a foregoing act is a contra|diction. God's di&s;po&s;ing this determina|tion of the will by his permi&s;&s;ion, does not at all infringe the liberty of the crea|ture. It is in no re&s;pect any more incon|&s;i&s;tent with liberty, than mere chance or contingence. For if the determination of the will be from blind, unde&s;igning chance, it is no more from the agent him&s;elf, or from the will it&s;elf, than if we &s;uppo&s;e, in the ea&s;e, a wi&s;e, divine di&s;po&s;al by per|mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="2">2. It was fit that it &s;hould be at the or|dering of the divine wi&s;dom, and good plea&s;ure, whether every particular man &s;hould &s;tand for him&s;elf, or whether the fir&s;t father of mankind &s;hould be appoint|ed as the moral and federal head and rep|re&s;entative of the re&s;t. If God has not Liberty in this matter to determine either
<PB N="20" REF="049067_0019_10264EE6B2998978">
of the&s;e two as he plea&s;es, it mu&s;t be be|cau&s;e determining that the fir&s;t father of men &s;hould repre&s;ent the re&s;t, and not that every one &s;hould &s;tand for him&s;elf, is in|jurious to mankind. For if it be not in|jurious to mankind, how is it unju&s;t? But it is not injurious to mankind; for there is nothing in the nature of the ca&s;e it&s;elf, that makes it better for mankind that each man &s;hould &s;tand for him&s;elf, than that all &s;hould be repre&s;ented by their common father; as the lea&s;t reflection or con&s;ider|ation will convince any one. And if there be nothing in the nature of the thing that makes the former better for mankind than the latter, then it will follow, that man|kind are not hurt in God's choo&s;ing and appointing the latter, rather than the for|mer; or, which is the &s;ame thing, that it is not injurious to mankind.</P>
<P N="3">3. When men are fallen, and become &s;inful, God by his &s;overeignty has a right to determine about their redemption as he plea&s;es. He has a right to determine whether he will redeem any or no. He might, if he had plea&s;ed, have left all to peri&s;h, or might have redeemed all. Or, he may redeem &s;ome, and leave others; and if he doth &s;o, he may take whom he plea&s;es, and leave whom he plea&s;es. To &s;uppo&s;e that all have forfeited his favour, and de&s;erved to peri&s;h, and to &s;uppo&s;e that

<P>It is meet that God &s;hould order all the&s;e things according to his own plea&s;ure. By rea&s;on of his greatne&s;s and glory, by which he is infinitely above all, he is worthy to be &s;overeign, and that his plea&s;ure &s;hould in all things take place: He is worthy that he &s;hould make him&s;elf his end, and that he &s;hould make nothing but his own wi&s;dom his rule in pur&s;uing that end, with|out a&s;king leave or coun&s;el of any, and without giving any account of any of his matters. It is fit that he that is ab&s;olute|ly perfect, and infinitely wi&s;e, and the fountain of all wi&s;dom, &s;hould determine every thing by his own will, even things of the greate&s;t importance, &s;uch as the e|ternal &s;alvation or damnation of &s;inners. It is meet that he &s;hould be thus &s;overeign, becau&s;e he is the fir&s;t being, the eternal being, whence all other beings are. He is the creator of all things; and all are ab|&s;olutely and univer&s;ally dependent on him; and therefore it is meet that he &s;hould act as the &s;overeign po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of heaven and earth.</P>

<P>In the improvement of this doctrine, I would fir&s;t direct my&s;elf to &s;inners that are afraid of damnation, in a u&s;e of convic|tion. This may be matter of conviction to you, that it would be ju&s;t and righteous with God eternally to reject and de&s;troy you. This is what you are in danger of: You that are a Chri&s;tle&s;s &s;inner, are a poor condemned creature: God's wrath &s;till a|bides upon you; and the &s;entence of con|demnation lies upon you: You are in God's hands, and it is uncertain what he will do with you. You are afraid what will become of you: You are afraid that it will be your portion to &s;uffer eternal burn|ings; and your fears are not without grounds; you have rea&s;on to tremble eve|ry moment. But let you be never &s;o much afraid of it, let eternal damnation be nev|er &s;o dreadful, yet it is ju&s;t: God may neverthele&s;s do it, and be righteous&punc; and holy, and glorious in it. Though eternal damnation be what you cannot bear, and how much &s;oever your heart &s;hrinks at the thoughts of it, yet God's ju&s;tice may be glorious in it. The dreadfulne&s;s of the thing on your part, and the greatne&s;s of your dread of it, do not render it the le&s;s righteous on God's part. If you think otherwi&s;e&punc; it is a &s;ign that you do not &s;ee your&s;elf, that you are not &s;en&s;ible what &s;in is, nor how much

worm. But yet you have &s;lighted that honour of God, and valued it no more than the dirt under your feet. You have been told that &s;uch and &s;uch things were contra|ry to the will of an holy God, and again&s;t his honour; but you cared not for that. God called upon you, and exhorted you to be more tender of his honour; but you went on without regarding him. Thus have you &s;lighted God! And yet, is it hard that God &s;hould &s;light you? Are you more honourable than God, that he mu&s;t be obliged to make much of you, how light &s;oever you make of him and his glory?</P>
<P>And you have not only &s;lighted God in time pa&s;t, but you &s;light him &s;till. You indeed now make a pretence and &s;hew of honouring him in your prayers, and at|tendance on other external duties, and by a &s;ober countenance, and &s;eeming devout|ne&s;s in your words and behaviour; but it is all mere di&s;&s;embling. That downca&s;t look and &s;eeming reverence, is not from any honour you have to God in your heart, though you would have it go &s;o, and would have God take it &s;o. You that have not believed in Chri&s;t, have not the lea&s;t jot of honour to God; that &s;hew of it is merely forced, and what you are driven to by fear, like tho&s;e men|tioned in P&s;alm lxvi.3. "Through the greatne&s;s of thy power &s;hall thine enemies &s;ubmit them&s;elves to thee." In the origi|nal

it is, "&s;hall lie unto thee;" that is, yield feigned &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and di&s;&s;emble re|&s;pect and honour to thee. There is a rod held over you that makes you &s;eem to pay &s;uch re&s;pect to God. This religion and devotion, even the very appearance of it, would &s;oon be gone, and all vani&s;h away, if that were removed. Sometimes it may be you weep in your prayers, and in your hearing &s;ermons, and hope God will take notice of it, and take it for &s;ome honour; but he &s;ees it to be all hypocri&s;y. You weep for your&s;elf; you are afraid of hell; and do you think that that is worthy that God &s;hould take much notice of you, be|cau&s;e you can cry when you are in danger of being damned: when at the &s;ame time you indeed care nothing for God's hon|our.</P>
<P>Seeing you thus di&s;regard &s;o great a God, is it a heinous thing for God to flight you, a little, wretched, de&s;picable creature; a worm, a mere nothing, and le&s;s than noth|ing; a vile in&s;ect, that has ri&s;en up in con|tempt again&s;t the Maje&s;ty of heaven and earth?</P>
<P N="3">3. Why &s;hould God be looked upon as obliged to be&s;tow &s;alvation upon you, when you have been &s;o ungrateful for the mer|cies he has be&s;towed upon you already? God has tried you with a great deal of kindne&s;s, and he never has &s;incerely been

thanked by you for any of it. God has watched over you, and pre&s;erved you, and provided for you, and followed you with mercy all your days; and yet you have continued &s;inning again&s;t him. He has given you food and raiment, but you have improved both in the &s;ervice of &s;in. He has pre&s;erved you while you &s;lept; but when you aro&s;e, it was to return to the old trade of &s;inning, God, notwith&s;tanding this ingratitude, has &s;till continued his mercy; but his kindne&s;s has never won your heart, or brought you to a more grate|ful behaviour towards him. It may be you have received many remarkable mercies, recoveries from &s;ickne&s;s, or pre&s;ervations of your life, when at one time and anoth|er expo&s;ed by accidents, when if you had died, you would have gone directly to hell: But you never had any true thankfulne&s;s for any of the&s;e mercies. God has kept you out of hell, and continued your day of grace, and the offers of &s;alvation, this &s;o long a time; and that, it may be, while you did not regard your own &s;alvation &s;o much as to go in &s;ecret and a&s;k God for it: And now God has greatly added to his mercy to you, by giving you the &s;trivings of his Spirit, whereby you have a mo&s;t precious opportunity for your &s;alvation in your hands. But what thanks has God received for it? What kind of returns have you made for all this kindne&s;s? As God has

multiplied mercies, &s;o have you multiplied provocations.</P>
<P>And yet now are you ready to quarrel for mercy, and to find fault with God, not on|ly that he does not be&s;tow more mercy, but to contend with him, becau&s;e he does not be&s;tow infinite mercy upon you, heav|en with all it contains, and even him&s;elf, for your eternal portion. What ideas have you of your&s;elf, that you think God is obliged to do &s;o much for you, though you treat him never &s;o ungratefully for his kindne&s;s that you have been followed with all the days of your life?</P>
<P N="4">4. You have voluntarily cho&s;en to be with Satan in his enmity and oppo&s;ition to God; how ju&s;tly therefore might you be with him in his puni&s;hment?

You have cho&s;en rather to hearken to Satan than to God, and would be with him in his work: You have given your&s;elf up to him, to be &s;ubject to his power and government, in oppo&s;ition to God.

You are ready, it may be, to complain that you have often prayed, and earne&s;tly begged of God to &s;hew you mercy, and yet have no an&s;wer of prayer: One &s;ays, I have been con&s;tant in prayer for &s;o many years, and God has not heard me. Another &s;ays, I have done what I can; I have prayed as earne&s;tly as I am able; I do not &s;ee how I can do more; and it will &s;eem hard if after all I am denied. But do you con&s;ider how often God has called, and you have denied him? God has called earne&s;tly and for a

You let him call as loud, and as long as he would; for your part, you had no lei&s;ure to attend to what he &s;aid; you had other bu&s;ine&s;s to mind; you had the&s;e and tho&s;e lu&s;ts to gratify and plea&s;e, and world|ly concerns to attend; you could not af|ford to &s;tand con&s;idering of what God had to &s;ay to you. When the mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t that he &s;ent on that errand, have &s;tood and pleaded with you, in his name, Sabbath after Sabbath, and have even &s;pent their &s;trength in it, how little was you moved by it! It did not alter you, but you went on &s;till as you u&s;ed to do; when you went away, you returned again to your &s;ins, to your la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s, to your vain mirth, to your covetou&s;ne&s;s, to your intemperance, and that has been the language of your heart and practice. Exod. v.2. "Who is the Lord, that I &s;hould obey his voice?" Was it no crime for you to refu&s;e to hear when God called; and yet is it now very hard that God does not hear your earne&s;t calls, and that though your calling on God be not from any re&s;pect to him, but merely from &s;elf-love? The devil would beg as earne&s;tly as you, if he had any hope to get &s;alvation by it, and a thou&s;and times as ear|ne&s;tly, and yet be as much of a devil as he

What can have more ju&s;tice in it than that, in Prov. i.24, &amp;c.

<P>When a &s;inner takes encouragement to neglect that &s;ecret prayer that God has commanded, and to gratify his lu&s;ts, and to live a carnal, vain life, and thwart God, and run upon him, and contemn him to his face, thinking with him&s;elf, "If I do &s;o, God would not damn me; he is a merciful God, and therefore when I &s;eek his mercy he will be&s;tow it upon me;" mu&s;t God be accounted hard becau&s;e he will not do ac|cording to &s;uch a &s;inner's pre&s;umption? Cannot he be excu&s;ed from &s;howing &s;uch a &s;inner mercy when he is plea&s;ed to &s;eek it, without incurring the charge of being unju&s;t? If this be the ca&s;e, God has no liberty to vindicate his own honour and maje&s;ty; but mu&s;t lay him&s;elf open to all manner of affronts, and yield him&s;elf up to the abu&s;es of vile men, and lot them di&s;o|bey, de&s;pi&s;e, and di&s;honour him as much as they will; and when they have done, his mercy and pardoning grace mu&s;t not be in his own power and at his own di&s;po&s;al, but he mu&s;t be obliged to di&s;pen&s;e it at their call: He mu&s;t take the&s;e bold and vile con|temners of his maje&s;ty, when it &s;uits them to a&s;k it, and mu&s;t forgive all their &s;ins, and not only &s;o, but mu&s;t adopt them into his family, and make them his children, and be&s;tow eternal glory upon them.

Though it was very offen&s;ive to God, though you heard that God infinitely hated &s;in, and that &s;uch practices as you went on in were exceeding contrary to his nature, will, and glory, yet that did not make you unea&s;y; you heard that he was a very merciful God, and had grace enough to pardon you, and &s;o cared not how offen|&s;ive your &s;ins were to him.

Now how righteous would it be if God &s;hould &s;wear in his wrath, that you &s;hould never be the better for his being infinitely merciful!</P>
<P>Your ingratitude has been the greater, that you have not only abu&s;ed the attribute of God's mercy, taking encouragement from it to continue in &s;in, but you have thus abu&s;ed this mercy, under that very notion of its being exerci&s;ed towards you, in a &s;uppo&s;ition that God would exerci&s;e infinite mercy to you in particular; which con&s;ideration &s;hould have e&s;pecially en|deared God to you.

<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t,</HI> There is a great deal of difference between a willingne&s;s not to be damned, and a being willing to receive Chri&s;t for your Saviour.

This forced compliance is not what Chri&s;t &s;eeks of you; he &s;eeks a free and willing accept|ance, P&s;alm cx.3. "Thy people &s;hall be willing in the day of thy power." He &s;eeks not that you &s;hould receive him a|gain&s;t your will, but with a free will. He &s;eeks entertainment in your heart and choice.&mdash;And,</P>
<P>If you refu&s;e thus to receive Chri&s;t, how ju&s;t is it that Chri&s;t &s;hould refu&s;e to re|ceive you? How rea&s;onable are Chri&s;t's

terms, who offers to &s;ave all tho&s;e that willingly, or with a good will, accept of him for their Saviour! Who can ration|ally expect that Chri&s;t &s;hould force him|&s;elf upon any man to be his Saviour? Or what can be looked for more rea&s;onable, than that all that would be &s;aved by Chri&s;t, &s;hould heartily and freely entertain him? And &s;urely it would be very di&s;honourable for Chri&s;t to offer him&s;elf upon lower terms.</P>
<P>But I would now proceed,</P>
<P N="2">2. To &s;hew that it is really &s;o, that you are not willing to have Chri&s;t for a Sav|iour. To convince you of it, con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>&s;t,</HI> How is it po&s;&s;ible that you &s;hould be willing to accept of Chri&s;t as a Saviour from the de&s;ert of a puni&s;hment that you are not &s;en&s;ible you have de&s;erved. If you are truly willing to accept of Chri&s;t as a Saviour, it mu&s;t be as a &s;acrifice to make atonement for your guilt: Chri&s;t came in|to the world on this errand, to offer him|&s;elf as an atonement, to an&s;wer for our de|&s;ert of puni&s;hment. But how is it po&s;&s;ible that you &s;hould be willing to accept of Chri&s;t as an atonement for that guilt that you be not &s;en&s;ible that you have? How can you be willing to have Chri&s;t for a Sav|iour from a de&s;ert of hell? If you have not really de&s;erved everla&s;ting burnings in hell, then the very offer of an atone|ment for &s;uch a de&s;ert is an impo&s;ition up-you on. If you have no &s;uch guilt upon
<PB N="52" REF="049067_0051_10264F37DBC35878">
you, then the very offer of a &s;atisfaction for that guilt is an injury, becau&s;e it im|plies in it a charge of guilt that you are free from. Now therefore it is impo&s;&s;ible that a man that is not convinced of his guilt can be willing to accept of an offer; becau&s;e he cannot be willing to accept the charge that the offer implies: That he looks upon as injurious. A man that is not convinced that he has de&s;erved &s;o dreadful a puni&s;hment, cannot willingly &s;ubmit to be charged with it: If he thinks he is willing, it is but a mere forced, feign|ed bu&s;ine&s;s; becau&s;e in his heart he looks upon him&s;elf greatly injured; and there|fore he cannot freely accept of Chri&s;t, un|der that notion of a Saviour from that guilt, and from the de&s;ert of &s;uch a pun|i&s;hment; for &s;uch an acceptance is an im|plicit owning that he does de&s;erve &s;uch a puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>I do not &s;ay, but that men may be will|ing to be &s;aved from an unde&s;erved puni&s;h|ment; they may rather not &s;uffer it than &s;uffer it: But a man cannot be willing to accept one at God's hands, under the no|tion of a Saviour from puni&s;hment de&s;erv|ed from him, that he thinks he has not de|&s;erved&punc; it is impo&s;&s;ible that any one &s;hould freely allow a Saviour under that notion&punc; Such an one cannot like the way of &s;alva|tion by Chri&s;t; For if he thinks he has not de&s;erved hell, then he will think that free|dom
<PB N="53" REF="049067_0052_10264F3A5C98DCA0">
from hell is a debt; and therefore cannot willingly and heartily receive it as a free gift.&mdash;If a king &s;hould condemn a man to &s;ome exceeding tormenting death, which the condemned per&s;on thought him&s;elf not de&s;erving of, but looked upon the &s;entence unju&s;t and cruel, and the king, when the time of execution drew nigh, &s;hould offer him his pardon, under the notion of a very great act of grace and clemency, the condemned per&s;on never could willingly and heartily allow it under that notion, becau&s;e he judged him&s;elf un|ju&s;tly condemned.</P>
<P>Now by this it is evident that you are not willing to accept of Chri&s;t as your Saviour; becau&s;e you never yet had &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of your own &s;infulne&s;s, and &s;uch a conviction of your great guilt in God's &s;ight, as to be indeed convinced that you lay ju&s;tly condemned to the puni&s;hment of hell. You never was convinced that you had forfeited all favour, and was in God's hands and at his &s;overeign and ar|bitrary di&s;po&s;al, to be either de&s;troyed or &s;aved, ju&s;t as he plea&s;ed. You never yet was convinced of the &s;overeignty of God. Hence are there &s;o many objections ari&s;ing again&s;t the ju&s;tice of your puni&s;hment from original &s;in, and from God's decrees, from mercy &s;hown to others, and the like.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>d,</HI> That you be not &s;incerely willing to accept of Chri&s;t as your Saviour, appears
<PB N="54" REF="049067_0053_10264F3BE337F9D8">
by this, That you never have been con|vinced that he is &s;ufficient for the work of your &s;alvation. You never had a &s;ight or &s;en&s;e of any &s;uch excellency or worthi|ne&s;s in Chri&s;t, as &s;hould give &s;uch great value to his blood and his mediation with God, as that it was &s;ufficient to be accepted for &s;uch exceeding guilty creatures, and tho&s;e that have &s;o provoked God, and ex|po&s;ed them&s;elves to &s;uch amazing wrath. A &s;aying it is &s;o, and a cu&s;tomary yielding and allowing it to be as others &s;ay, is a ve|ry different thing from being really con|vinced of it, and a being made &s;en&s;ible of it in your own heart. The &s;ufficiency of Chri&s;t depends upon, or rather con&s;i&s;ts in his excellency. It is becau&s;e he is &s;o ex|cellent a per&s;on that his blood is of &s;uffi|cient value to atone for &s;in, and it is hence that his obedience is &s;o worthy in God's &s;ight; it is al&s;o hence that his interce&s;&s;ion is &s;o prevalent; and therefore tho&s;e that never had any &s;piritual &s;ight or &s;en&s;e of Chri&s;t's excellency, cannot be &s;en&s;ible of his &s;ufficiency.</P>
<P>And that &s;inners be not convinced that Chri&s;t is &s;ufficient for the work he has undertaken, appears mo&s;t manife&s;tly when they are under great convictions of their &s;in, and danger of God's wrath. Though it may be before they thought they could allow Chri&s;t to be &s;ufficient, (for it is ea&s;y to allow any one to be &s;ufficient for our

defence at a time when we &s;ee no danger) yet when they come to be &s;en&s;ible of their guilt and God's wrath, what di&s;couraging thoughts do they entertain! How are they ready to draw towards de&s;pair, as if there were no hope or help for &s;uch wicked creatures as they! The rea&s;on is, They have no apprehen&s;ion or &s;en&s;e of any other way that God's maje&s;ty can be vindicated, but only in their mi&s;ery. To tell them of the blood of Chri&s;t &s;ignifies nothing, it does not relieve their &s;inking, de&s;pairing hearts. This makes it mo&s;t evident that they are not convinced that Chri&s;t is &s;uffi|cient to be their Mediator.</P>
<P>And as long as they are unconvinced of this, it is impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould be willing to accept of him as their Mediator and Sav|iour. A man in di&s;tre&s;&s;ing fear will not willingly betake him&s;elf to a fort that he judges not &s;ufficient to defend him from the enemy. A man will not willingly ven|ture out into the ocean in a &s;hip that he &s;u&s;pects is leaky, and will &s;ink before he gets through his voyage.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>d,</HI> It is evident that you are not willing to have Chri&s;t for your Saviour, becau&s;e you have &s;o mean an opinion of him, that you dur&s;t not tru&s;t his faithfulne&s;s. One that undertakes to be the Saviour of &s;ouls had need be faithful; for if he fails in &s;uch a tru&s;t, how great is the lo&s;s! But you are not convinced of Chri&s;t's faithfulne&s;s;
<PB N="56" REF="049067_0055_10264F421425FD50">
as is evident, becau&s;e at &s;uch times as when you are in a con&s;iderable mea&s;ure &s;en&s;ible of your guilt and God's anger, you can|not he convinced that Chri&s;t is willing to accept of you, or that he &s;tands ready to receive you&punc; if you &s;hould come to him, though Chri&s;t &s;o much invites you to come to him&punc; and has &s;o fully declared that he will not reject you, if you do come; as particularly, John, vi.37.: "Him that cometh to me, I will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out." Now, there is no man can be heartily will|ing to tru&s;t his eternal welfare in the hands of an unfaithful per&s;on, or one who&s;e faithfulne&s;s he &s;u&s;pects.</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>th,</HI> You are not willing to be &s;aved in that way by Chri&s;t, as is evident, becau&s;e you are not willing that your own goodne&s;s &s;hould be &s;et at nought. In the way of &s;alvation by Chri&s;t, men's own goodne&s;s is wholly &s;et at nought; there is no account at all made of it. Now you cannot be will|ing to be &s;aved in a way, wherein your own goodne&s;s is &s;et at nought, as is evident by that, that you make much of it your&s;elf. You make much of your prayers and pains in religion, and are often thinking of them; how con&s;iderable do they appear to you, when you look back upon them! And how much are &s;ome of you in thinking how much more you have done than &s;ome oth|ers, and in expecting &s;ome re&s;pect or re|gard that God &s;hould manife&s;t to what you

do: Now, if you make &s;o much of what you do your&s;elf, it is impo&s;&s;ible that you &s;hould be freely willing that God &s;hould make nothing of it. As we may &s;ee in oth|er things; if a man is proud of a great e&s;tate, or if he values him&s;elf much upon his honourable office, or his great abilities, it is impo&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould like it, and heartily approve of it, that others &s;hould make light of the&s;e things and de&s;pi&s;e them.</P>
<P>Seeing therefore that it is &s;o evident that you refu&s;e to accept of Chri&s;t as your Saviour, why is Chri&s;t to be blamed that he does not &s;ave you? Chri&s;t has offered him&s;elf to you to be your Saviour in time pa&s;t, and he continues offering him&s;elf &s;till, and you continue to reject him, and yet complain that he does not &s;ave you.&mdash;So &s;trangely unrea&s;onable, and incon&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves, are go&s;pel &s;inners!</P>
<P>But I expect that there are many of you that in your hearts &s;till object; Your mouths be not &s;topped.&mdash;Such an objec|tion as this, is probably now in the hearts of many here pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> If it be &s;o, that I am not willing to have Chri&s;t for my Saviour, yet I cannot make my&s;elf willing.</P>
<P>But I would give an an&s;wer to this ob|jection by laying down two things, that mu&s;t be acknowledged to be exceeding ev|ident.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="58" REF="049067_0057_10264F4627AD2E48">1. It is no excu&s;e, that you cannot re|ceive Chri&s;t of your&s;elf, unle&s;s you would if you could. This is &s;o evident of it&s;elf, that it &s;carce needs any proof. Certainly, if per&s;ons would not if they could, it is ju&s;t the &s;ame thing as to the blame that lies upon them, whether they can or cannot. If you were willing, and then found that you could not, your being unable would alter the ca&s;e, and might be &s;ome excu&s;e; becau&s;e then the defect would not be in your will, but only in your ability: But as long as you will not, it is no matter what the ability is, whether you have ability or no ability.</P>
<P>If you be not willing to accept of Chri&s;t, it will follow that you have no &s;incere willingne&s;s to be willing; becau&s;e the will always nece&s;&s;arily approves of, and re&s;ts in its own acts. To &s;uppo&s;e the contrary would be to &s;uppo&s;e a contradiction; it would be to &s;uppo&s;e that a man's will is contrary to it&s;elf, or that he wills contrary to what he him&s;elf wills. So that as you are not willing to come to Chri&s;t, and can|not make your&s;elf willing, &s;o you have no &s;incere de&s;ire to be willing; and therefore may mo&s;t ju&s;tly peri&s;h without a Saviour. There is no excu&s;e at all for you; for &s;ay what you will about your inability, the &s;eat of your blame lies in your perver&s;e will, that is an enemy to the Saviour. It is
<PB N="59" REF="049067_0058_10264F49AB732370">
in vain for you to tell of your want of pow|er, as long as your will is found defective. If a man &s;hould hate you, and devour you, and exalt him&s;elf, and &s;mite you in the face, and tell you that he did it voluntarily, and becau&s;e he had a mind to, but only &s;hould tell you at the &s;ame time, that he hated you &s;o much, that he could not help choo&s;ing and willing &s;o to do, would you take it the more patiently for that? Would not your indignation be rather &s;tirred up the more?</P>
<P N="2">2. If you would be willing if you could, that is no excu&s;e, unle&s;s your willingne&s;s to be willing be &s;incere. That which is hypocritical, and does not come from the heart, but is merely forced, ought wholly to be &s;et a&s;ide, as worthy of no con&s;idera|tion; and that becau&s;e common &s;en&s;e teach|es, that that which is not hearty but hy|pocritical is indeed nothing, being only a &s;hew of what is not; but that which is good for nothing, ought to go for nothing. But if you &s;et a&s;ide all that is not free, and call nothing a willingne&s;s, but a free, hear|ty willingne&s;s, then &s;ee how the ca&s;e &s;tands, and whether or no you have not lo&s;t all your excu&s;e for &s;tanding out again&s;t the calls of the go&s;pel. You &s;ay you would make your&s;elf willing to accept if you could; but it is not from any good princi|ple that you are willing for that; it is not from any free inclination, or true re&s;pect

to Chri&s;t, or any love to your duty, or any &s;pirit of obedience, or from the influence of any manner of real re&s;pect, or tendency in your heart, towards any thing that is good, or from any other principle than &s;uch as is in the hearts of devils, and would make them have the &s;ame &s;ort of willingne&s;s in the &s;ame circum&s;tances. It is therefore evi|dent, that there can be no goodne&s;s in that woulding to be willing to come to Chri&s;t: And that which has no goodne&s;s, cannot be an excu&s;e for any badne&s;s. If there be no good in it, then it &s;ignifies nothing, and weighs nothing, when put into the &s;cales to counterbalance that which is bad.</P>
<P>Sinners therefore &s;pend their time in fooli&s;h arguing and objecting, making much o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> that which is good for nothing, making tho&s;e excu&s;es that be not worth offering. It is in vain to keep making objections: You &s;tand ju&s;tly condemned: The blame lies all at your door: Thru&s;t it off from you as often as you will, it will return up|on you: Sew fig leaves as long as you will, your nakedne&s;s will appear: You contin|ue wilfully and wickedly rejecting Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and will not have him for your Saviour, and therefore it is &s;otti&s;h madne&s;s in you to charge Chri&s;t with inju&s;tice that he does not &s;ave you.</P>
<P>Here is the &s;in of unbelief! Thus the guilt of that great &s;in lies upon you! If you never had thus treated a Saviour, you
<PB N="61" REF="049067_0060_10264F4EB9823E88">
might mo&s;t ju&s;tly have been damned to all eternity: It would but be exactly agreea|ble to your treatment of God. But be&s;ides this, when God, notwith&s;tanding, has of|fered you his own dear Son, to &s;ave you from this endle&s;s mi&s;ery you had de&s;erved, and not only &s;o, but to make you happy eter|nally in the enjoyment of him&s;elf you re|fu&s;ed him, and would not have him for your Saviour, and &s;till refu&s;e to comply with the offers of the go&s;pel; what can render any per&s;on more inexcu&s;able? If you &s;hould now peri&s;h forever, what can you have to &s;ay?</P>
<P>Hereby the ju&s;tice of God in your de|&s;truction appears in two re&s;pects.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is more abundantly manife&s;t that it is ju&s;t that you &s;hould be de&s;troyed. Ju&s;|tice never appears &s;o con&s;picuous as it does after refu&s;ed and abu&s;ed mercy. Ju&s;tice in damnation appears abundantly the more clear and bright, after a wilful rejection of offered &s;alvation. What can an offenc|ed prince do more than freely offer pardon to a condemned malefactor? And if he re|fu&s;es to accept of it, will any one &s;ay that his execution is unju&s;t?</P>
<P N="2">2. God's ju&s;tice evill appear in your greater de&s;truction. Be&s;ides the guilt that you would have had if a Saviour never had been offered, you bring that great ad|ditional guilt upon you, of mo&s;t ungrate|fully refu&s;ing offered deliverance. What
<PB N="62" REF="049067_0061_10264F50468DD370">
more ba&s;e and vile treatment of God can there be, than for you, when ju&s;tly con|demned to eternal mi&s;ery, and ready to be executed, and God graciou&s;ly &s;ends his own Son, who comes and knocks at your door with a pardon in his hand, and not only a pardon, but a deed of eternal glory; I &s;ay, what can be wor&s;e, than for you, out of di&s;like and enmity again&s;t God and his Son, to refu&s;e to accept tho&s;e benefits at his hands! How ju&s;tly may the anger of God be greatly incen&s;ed and increa&s;ed by it! When a &s;inner thus ungratefully re|jects mercy, his la&s;t error is wor&s;e that the fir&s;t; this is more heinous than all his for|mer rebellion, and may ju&s;tly bring down more fearful wrath upon him.</P>
<P>The heinou&s;ne&s;s of this &s;in of rejecting a Saviour e&s;pecially appears in two things,</P>
<P N="1">1. The greatne&s;s of the benefits offered; which appears in the greatne&s;s of the de|liverance, which is from inexpre&s;&s;ible de|grees of corruption and wickedne&s;s of heart and life, the lea&s;t degree of which is infinitely evil: and from mi&s;ery that is everla&s;ting; and in the greatne&s;s and glo|ry of the inheritance purcha&s;ed and of|fered, Heb. ii.3. "How &s;hall we e&s;cape, if we neglect &s;o great &s;alvation?"</P>
<P N="2">2. The wonderfulne&s;s of the way in which the&s;e benefits are procured and of|fered. That God &s;hould lay help on his own Son, when our ca&s;e was &s;o deplorable
<PB N="63" REF="049067_0062_10264F52D6D20E68">
that help could be had in no mere crea|ture; and that he &s;hould undertake for us, and &s;hould come into the world, and take upon him our nature, and &s;hould not only appear in a low &s;tate of life, but &s;hould die &s;uch a death, and endure &s;uch torments and contempt for &s;inners while enemies, how wonderful is it! And what tongue or pen can &s;et forth the greatne&s;s of the ingratitude, ba&s;ene&s;s, and perver&s;e|ne&s;s that there is in it, when a peri&s;hing &s;in|ner that is in the mo&s;t extreme nece&s;&s;ity of &s;alvation, rejects it, after it is procured in &s;uch a way as this! That &s;o glorious a per&s;on &s;hould be thus treated, and that when he comes on &s;o gracious an errand! That he &s;hould &s;tand &s;o long offering him|&s;elf and calling and inviting, as he has done to many of you, and all to no purpo&s;e, but all the while be &s;et at nought! Surely you might ju&s;tly be ca&s;t into hell without one more offer of a Saviour! Yea, and thru&s;t down into the lowe&s;t hell! Herein you have exceeded the very devils; for they never rejected the offers of &s;uch glorious mercy; no, nor of any mercy at all. This will be the di&s;tingui&s;hing condemnation of go&s;pel &s;inners, John, iii.18. "He that be|lieveth not, is condemned already, becau&s;e he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God."</P>
<P>That outward &s;moothne&s;s of your carri|age towards Chri&s;t, that appearance of re|&s;pect
<PB N="64" REF="049067_0063_10264F5669C91CF0">
to him in your looks, your &s;peeches, and ge&s;tures, do not argue but that you &s;et him at nought in your heart. There may be much of the&s;e outward &s;hews of re&s;pect, and yet you be like Judas, that betrayed the Son of man with a ki&s;s; and like tho&s;e mockers that bowed the knee before him, and at the &s;ame time &s;pit in his face.</P>
<P N="3">III. If God &s;hould forever ca&s;t you off and de&s;troy you, it would be agreeable to your treatment of others; it would be no other than what would be exactly an&s;wer|able to your behaviour towards your fel|low creatures, that have the &s;ame human nature, and are naturally in the &s;ame cir|cum&s;tances with you, and that you ought to love as your&s;elf. And that appears e&s;|pecially in two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. You have many of you been oppo&s;ite in your &s;pirit to the &s;alvation of others. There are &s;everal ways that natural men manife&s;t a &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition again&s;t the &s;alvation of other's &s;ouls. It &s;ometimes ap|pears by a fear that their companions, ac|quaintance, and equals, will obtain mercy, and &s;o become un&s;peakably happier than they. It is &s;ometimes manife&s;ted by an unea&s;ine&s;s at the news of others having hopefully obtained. It appears when per|&s;ons envy others for it, and di&s;like them the more, and di&s;reli&s;h their talk, and avoid their company, and cannot bear to hear their religious di&s;cour&s;e, and e&s;pecially
<PB N="65" REF="049067_0064_10263A648A9DD988">
to receive warnings and coun&s;els from them. And it oftentimes appears by their backwardne&s;s to entertain charitable thoughts of them, and their being difficult|ly brought to believe that it is really &s;o, that they have obtained mercy, and a for|wardne&s;s to li&s;ten to any thing that &s;eems to contradict it. The devil hated to own Job's &s;incerity, Job. i.7. &amp;c. and chap. ii. ver&s;es 3.4.5. There appears very often much of this &s;pirit of the devil in natural men. Sometimes they are ready to make a ridicule of others pretended godline&s;s: They &s;peak of the ground of other's hopes, as the enemies of the Jews did of the wall that they built. Neh. iv.3. "Now To|biah the Ammonite was by him, and he &s;aid&punc; That which they build, if a fox go up, he &s;hall even break down their &s;tone wall." There are many that join with Sanballat and Tobiah, and are of the &s;ame &s;pirit with them. There always was, and always will be, an enmity betwixt the &s;eed of the &s;erpent and the &s;eed of the woman. It appeared in Cain, who hated his broth|er, becau&s;e he was more acceptable to God than him&s;elf: and it appears &s;till in the&s;e times&punc; and in this place. There are many that are like the elder brother, who could not bear it that the prodigal when he re|turned &s;hould be received with &s;uch joy and good entertainment, and was put into a fret by it, both again&s;t his brother that

<P>Thus have many of you been oppo&s;ite to the &s;alvation of others, that &s;tand in as great nece&s;&s;ity of it as you. You have been a|gain&s;t their being delivered from everla&s;t|ing mi&s;ery, that can bear it no better than you; not becau&s;e their &s;alvation would do you any hurt, or their damnation help you, any otherwi&s;e than as it would gratify that vile &s;pirit that is &s;o much like the &s;pirit of the devil, who, becau&s;e he is mi&s;erable him|&s;elf, is unwilling that others &s;hould be hap|py. How ju&s;t therefore is it that God &s;hould be oppo&s;ite to your &s;alvation? If you have &s;o little love or mercy in you as to begrudge your neighbour's &s;alvation, whom you have no cau&s;e to hate, but the law of God and nature requires you to love, why is God bound to exerci&s;e &s;uch infinite love and mercy to you, as to &s;ave you at the price of his own blood, that he is no way bound to love, but that have de&s;erved his hatred a thou&s;and and a thou&s;and times? You are not willing that others &s;hould be converted, that have behaved them&s;elves injuriou&s;ly towards you; and yet, will you count it hard if God does not be&s;tow con|verting grace upon you that have de&s;erved ten thou&s;and times as ill of God, as ever any of your neighbours have of you?

And yet will God be hard, if, notwith&s;tanding all your unworthine&s;s, and the abominablene&s;s of your &s;pirit and practice in his &s;ight, he does not &s;how you mercy? You would have God be&s;tow lib|erally on you, and upbraid not; but yet when he &s;hews mercy to others, you are ready to upbraid as &s;oon as you hear of it; you immediately are thinking with your&s;elf how ill they have behaved them&s;elves; and it may be your mouths on this occa&s;ion are open, enumerating and aggravating the &s;ins they have been guilty of. You would have God bury all your faults, and wholly blot out all your tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions; but yet if he be&s;tows mercy on others, it may be you will take that occa&s;ion to rake up all their old faults that you can think of. You do not much reflect on and condemn your&s;elf for your ba&s;ene&s;s and unju&s;t &s;pirit towards others, in your oppo&s;ition to their &s;alvation; you do not quarrel with your&s;elf, and con|demn your&s;elf for this; but yet you in your heart will quarrel with God, and condemn him, and fret at his di&s;pen&s;ations, becau&s;e you think he &s;eems oppo&s;ite to &s;hewing mercy to you. One would think that the con&s;ideration of the&s;e things &s;hould forever &s;top your mouth.</P>

other's damnation. Many of you, by the bad examples you have &s;et, by corrupting the minds of others, by your &s;inful conver|&s;ation, by leading them into &s;in, or &s;trength|ening them in &s;in, and by the mi&s;chief that you have done in human &s;ociety other ways that might be mentioned, have been guilty of tho&s;e things that have tended to others damnation. You have heretofore appeared on the &s;ide of &s;in and Satan, and have behaved your&s;elf &s;o as much to &s;trengthen their intere&s;t, and have been many ways acce&s;&s;ory to other's &s;ins, have hardened other's hearts, and thereby have done what has tended to the ruin of their &s;ouls.</P>
<P>And without doubt there are tho&s;e here pre&s;ent that have been in a great mea&s;ure the means of other's damnation. Though it is true that it is determined of God who he will &s;ave, and who not, from all eternity, yet one man may really be a means of oth|er's damnation as well as &s;alvation. Chri&s;t charges the &s;cribes and Phari&s;ees with this, Matth. xxiii.13. "Ye &s;hut up the kingdom of heaven again&s;t men; for ye neither go in your&s;elves, neither &s;uffer ye them that are entering, to go in." We have no rea&s;on to think that this congregation has none in it that are cur&s;ed from day to day by poor &s;ouls that are roaring out in hell, who&s;e damnation they have been a means of, or have greatly contributed to.</P>

If their children be not gone to hell, it is no thanks to them; it is not becau&s;e they have not done what has tended to their de&s;truction.

You have refu&s;ed to take care for your &s;alvation, as God has coun&s;elled and commanded you from time to time; and why may not God neglect it, now you &s;eek it of him? Is God obliged to be more care|ful of your happine&s;s, than you are either of your own happine&s;s or his glory? Is God bound to take that care for you, out of love to you, that you will not take for your&s;elf, either from love to your&s;elf, or
<PB N="70" REF="049067_0069_10265017D1E5B9E0">
regard to his authority? How long, and how greatly, have you neglected the welfare of your precious &s;oul, refu&s;ing to take pains and deny your&s;elf, or put your&s;elf a little out of your way for your &s;alvation, while God has been calling upon you! Neither your duty to God, nor love to your own &s;oul, were enough to induce you to do lit|tle things for your own eternal welfare; and yet do you now expect that God &s;hould do great things, putting forth almighty power, and exerci&s;ing infinite mercy for it? You was urged to take care for your &s;alvation, and not to put it off: You was told that that was the be&s;t time before you grew older&punc; and that it might be, if you would put it off, God would not hear you afterwards; but yet you would not heark|en; you would run the venture of it. Now how ju&s;tly might God order it &s;o, that it &s;hould be too late, leaving you to &s;eek in vain? You was told, that you would re|pent of it if you delayed; but you would not hear: How ju&s;tly therefore may God give you cau&s;e to repent of it, by refu&s;ing to &s;how you mercy now? If God &s;ees you going on in ways contrary to his commands and his glory, and requires you to for&s;ake them, and tells you that they are ways that tend to the de&s;truction of your own &s;oul, and therefore coun&s;els you to avoid them, and you refu&s;e; how ju&s;t would it be if God &s;hould be provoked by it, hencefor|ward

<P N="2">2. You have not only neglected your &s;alvation, but you have wilfully taken di|rect cour&s;es to undo your&s;elf. You have gone on in tho&s;e ways and practices that have directly tended to your damnation and have been perver&s;e and ob&s;tinate in it. You cannot plead ignorance; you had all the light &s;et before you that you could de|&s;ire: God told you that you was undoing your&s;elf; but yet you would do it: He told you that the path you was going in led to de&s;truction, and coun&s;elled you to avoid it; but you would not hearken: How ju&s;tly therefore may God leave you to be undone! You have ob&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ted to travel in the way that leads to hell for a long time, contrary to God's continual coun&s;els and commands, till it may be at length you are got almo&s;t to your journey's end, and are come near to hell's gate, and &s;o begin to be &s;en&s;ible of your danger and mi&s;ery; and now account it unju&s;t and hard if God will not deliver you! You have de&s;troyed your&s;elf, and de&s;troyed your&s;elf wilfully, contrary to God's repeat|ed coun&s;els, yea, and de&s;troyed your&s;elf in fighting again&s;t God: Now therefore, why do you blame any but your&s;elf if you are de&s;troyed? If you will undo your&s;elf in oppo&s;ing God, and while God oppo&s;es you by his calls and coun&s;els. and, it may be,

too, by the convictions of his Spirit, what can you object again&s;t it, if God now leaves you to be undone? You would have your own way, and did not like that God &s;hould oppo&s;e you in it, and your way was to ru|in your own &s;oul: How ju&s;t therefore is it, if, now at length, God cea&s;es to oppo&s;e you, and falls in with you, and lets your &s;oul be ruined; and as you would de&s;troy your&s;elf, &s;o &s;hould put to his hand to de|&s;troy you too! The ways you went on in had a natural tendency to your mi&s;ery: If you would drink poi&s;on in oppo&s;ition to God, and in contempt of him and his ad|vice, who can you blame but your&s;elf if you are poi&s;oned, and &s;o peri&s;h? If you would run into the fire again&s;t all re&s;traints both of God's mercy and authority, you mu&s;t even blame your&s;elf if you are burnt.</P>
<P>Thus I have propo&s;ed &s;ome things to your con&s;ideration, which, if you are not exceeding blind, &s;en&s;ele&s;s, and perver&s;e, will &s;top your month, and convince you that you &s;tand ju&s;tly condemned before God, and that he would in no wi&s;e deal hardly with you, but altogether ju&s;tly, in denying you any mercy, and in refu&s;ing to hear your prayers, let you pray never &s;o earne&s;tly, and never &s;o often, and continue in it never &s;o long; and that God may utterly di&s;regard your tears and moans, your heavy heart, your earne&s;t de&s;ires, and great endeavours; and that he may

ca&s;t you into eternal de&s;truction, without any regard to your welfare, denying you converting grace, and giving you over to Satan, and at la&s;t ca&s;t you into the lake that burns with fire and brim&s;tone, to be there to eternity, having no re&s;t day nor night, for ever glorifying his ju&s;tice upon you, in the pre&s;ence of the holy angels, and the pre&s;ence of the Lamb.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> But here many may &s;till object, (for I am &s;en&s;ible it is an hard thing to &s;top &s;inners mouth's,) "God &s;hews mercy to others that have done the&s;e things as well as I, yea, that have done a great deal wor&s;e than I."</P>
<P><HI>An&s;.</HI> 1. That does not prove that God is any way bound to &s;hew mercy to you, or them either. If God does be&s;tow it on others, he does not be&s;tow it on them be|cau&s;e he is bound to be&s;tow it: He might if he had plea&s;ed, with glorious ju&s;tice, have denied it them. If God be&s;tows it on &s;ome, that does not prove that he is bound to be&s;tow it on any; and if he is bound to be&s;tow it on none, then he is not bound to be&s;tow it on you. God is in debt to none; and if he gives to &s;ome that he is not in debt to, becau&s;e it is his plea|&s;ure, that does not bring him into debt to others. It alters not the ca&s;e as to you at all, whether others have it or have it not: You do not de&s;erve damnation the le&s;s, than if mercy never had been be&s;towed on

<P N="2">2. If this objection be good, then the ex|erci&s;e of God's mercy is not in his own right, and his grace is not his own to give That which God may not di&s;po&s;e of as he plea&s;es, is not his own; for that which is one's own, is at his own di&s;po&s;al: but if it be not God's own, then he is not capable of making a gift or pre&s;ent of it to any one; it is impo&s;&s;ible to give a debt.</P>
<P>What is it that you would make of God? Mu&s;t the great God be tied up to that, that he mu&s;t not u&s;e his own plea&s;ure in be&s;towing his own gifts, but if he be|&s;tows them on one, mu&s;t be looked upon obliged to be&s;tow them on another? Is not God worthy to have the &s;ame right, with re&s;pect to the gifts of his grace, that a man has to his money or goods? Is it be|cau&s;e God is not &s;o great, and &s;hould be more in &s;ubjection than man, that this can|not be allowed him? If any of you &s;ee cau&s;e to &s;hew kindne&s;s to a neighbour, do all the re&s;t of your neighbours come to you, and tell you, that you owe them &s;o much as you have given to &s;uch a man? But this is the way that you deal with God, as though God were not worthy to have as ab&s;olute a property in his goods, as you have in yours.</P>
<P>At this rate God cannot make a pre&s;ent of any thing; he has nothing of his own

If this be the ca&s;e, why do you pray to God to be&s;tow &s;aving grace upon you? If God does not do fairly to deny it you, becau&s;e he be&s;tows it on others, then it is not worth your while to pray for it, but you may go and tell him that he has be&s;towed it on the&s;e and tho&s;e, as bad or wor&s;e than you, and &s;o demand it of him as a debt.&mdash; And at this rate per&s;ons never need to thank God for &s;alvation, when it is be|&s;towed; for what occa&s;ion is there to thank God for that which was not at his own di&s;po&s;al, and that he could not fairly have denied?

<P>I will fini&s;h what I have to &s;ay to na|tural men in the application of this doc|trine, with a caution not to improve the doctrine to di&s;couragement. For though it would be righteous in God for ever to ca&s;t you off, and de&s;troy you, yet it will al&s;o be ju&s;t in God to &s;ave you in and through Chri&s;t, who has made complete &s;atisfaction for all &s;in. Rom. iii.25.26. "Whom God hath &s;et forth to be a pro|pitiation, through faith in his blood, to declare his righteou&s;ne&s;s for the remi&s;|&s;ion of &s;ins that are pa&s;t, through the for|bearance of God; to declare, I &s;ay, at this time his righteou&s;ne&s;s, that he might be ju&s;t, and the ju&s;tifier of him which believeth in Je&s;us." Yea, God may through this Mediator, not only ju&s;t|ly, but honourably, &s;hew you mercy. The blood of Chri&s;t is &s;o precious, that it is fully &s;ufficient to pay that debt that you have contracted, and perfectly to vindicate the divine Maje&s;ty from all that di&s;honour that has been ca&s;t upon it, by tho&s;e many great &s;ins of yours that have been mention|ed.

It was as great, and indeed a much greater thing, for Chri&s;t to die, than it would have been for you and all mankind to have burnt in hell to all eternity.

You cannot bring him under obli|gation by your works; do what you will, he will not look on him&s;elf obliged.

<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE FAREWELL SERMON.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not unlikely, that &s;ome of the readers of the following Sermon may be inqui&s;itive con|cerning the circum&s;tances of the difference be|tween me and the people of Northampton, that i&s;&s;ued in that &s;eparation between me and them which occa&s;ioned the preaching of this farewell &s;ermon.&mdash;There is, by no means, room here for a full account of that matter: But yet it &s;eems to be proper, and even nece&s;&s;ary, here to correct &s;ome gro&s;s mi&s;repre&s;entations, which have been abundantly, and (it is to be feared) by &s;ome af|fectedly and indu&s;triou&s;ly made, of that differ|ence: Such as, that I in&s;i&s;ted on per&s;ons being a&s;&s;ured of their being in a &s;tate of &s;alvation, in order to my admitting them into the church: that I required a particular relation of the method and order of a per&s;on's inward expe|rience, and of the time and manner of his con|ver&s;ion, as the te&s;t of his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> for Chri&s;tian communion; yea, that I have undertaken to &s;et up a pure church, and to make an exact and certain di&s;tinction between saints and hypocrites, by a pretended infalliable di&s;cerning the &s;tate of men's &s;ouls: that in the&s;e things I had fallen in with tho&s;e wild people, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> have lately appeared in New England, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> and that I my&s;elf was become a grand Seperati&s;t; that

I arrogated all the power of judging of the qualifications of candidates for communion wholly to my&s;elf, and in&s;i&s;ted on acting by my &s;ole authority, in the admi&s;&s;ion of members into the church&punc; &amp;c.</P>
<P>In oppo&s;ition to the&s;e &s;landerous repre&s;en|tations, I &s;hall at pre&s;ent only give my reader an account of &s;ome things which I laid before the council, that &s;eparated between me and my people, in order to their having a ju&s;t and full account of my principles, relating to the affair in controver&s;y.</P>
<P>Long before the &s;itting of the council, my people had &s;ent to the Reverend Mr Clark of Salem village, de&s;iring him to write in oppo|&s;ition to my principles. Which gave me occa|&s;ion to write to Mr Clark, that might have true information what my principles were. And in the time of the &s;itting of the council, I did, for their information, make a public declaration of my principles before them and the church, in the meeting-hou&s;e, of the &s;ame import with that in my letter to Mr Clark, and very much in the &s;ame words. And then, after|wards, &s;ent in to the council in writing, an extract of that letter, containing the informa|tion I had given Mr Clark, in the very words of my letter to him, that the council might read and con&s;ider it at their lei&s;ure, and have a more certain and &s;atisfactory knowledge what my principles were. The extract which I &s;ent in to them was in the following words.</P>

<P>"I am often, and I do not know but pretty

generally, in the country, repre&s;ented as of a new and odd opinion with re&s;pect to the terms of Chri&s;tian communion, and as being for intro|ducing a peculiar way of my own. Whereas, I do not perceive that I differ at all from the &s;cheme of Dr Watts, in his book intitled, <HI>The rational Foundation of a Chri&s;tian Church, and the Terms of Chri&s;tian Communion;</HI> which, he &s;ays, is the common &s;entiment and practice of all reformed churches. I had not &s;een this book of Dr Watt's when I publi&s;hed what I have written on the &s;ubject. But yet, I think my &s;entiments, as I have expre&s;&s;ed them, are as exactly agreeable to what he lays down, as if I had been his pupil. Nor do I at all go beyond what Dr Doddridge plainly &s;hews to be his &s;entiments, in his <HI>Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s of Religion</HI>&punc; and his <HI>Sermons on Regeneration,</HI> and his Parapha&s;e and Notes on the New Tes|tament. Nor indeed, Sir, when I con&s;ider the &s;entiments you have expre&s;&s;ed in your letters to Major Pomroy and Mr Billing, can I perceive but that they come exactly to the &s;ame thing that I maintain. You &s;uppo&s;e, the &s;acraments are not converting ordinances: But that, <HI>as &s;eals of the covenant, they pre&s;uppo&s;e conver|&s;ion, e&s;pecially in the adult; and that it is vi&s;ible &s;aint&s;hip, or&punc; in other words, a cred|ible profe&s;&s;ion of faith and repentance, a &s;olemn con&s;ent to the go&s;pel covenant, joined with a good conver&s;ation, and com|petent mea&s;ure of Chri&s;tian knowledge, is what gives a go&s;pel right to all &s;acred or|dinances:
<PB N="86" REF="049067_0085_10264F8347841280">
But that it is nece&s;&s;ary to tho&s;e that come to the&s;e ordinances, and in tho&s;e that profe&s;s a con&s;ent to the go&s;pel cove|nant, that they be &s;incere in their profe&s;|&s;ion,</HI> or at lea&s;t &s;hould think them&s;elvss &s;o.&mdash; The great things which I have &s;crupled in the e&s;tabli&s;hed method of this church's proceeding, and which I dare no longer go on in, is their publicly a&s;&s;enting to the form of words rehear&s;ed on occa&s;ion of their admi&s;&s;ion to the communion, without pretending thereby to mean any &s;uch thing as an hearty con&s;ent to the terms of the go&s;pel-covenant, or to mean any &s;uch faith or re|pentance as belong to the covenant of grace, and are the grand conditions of that covenant: It being, at the &s;ame time that the words are u&s;ed, their known and e&s;tabli&s;hed principle, which they openly profe&s;s and proceed upon, that men may and ought to u&s;e the&s;e words, and mean no &s;uch thing, but &s;omething el&s;e of a nature far inferior; which I think they have no di&s;tinct determinate notion of; but &s;omething co&s;i&s;tent with their knowing that they do not chu&s;e God as their chief good, but love the world more than him, and that they do not give them&s;elves up entirely to God, but make re&s;erves; and in &s;hort, knowing that they do not heartily con&s;ent to the go&s;pel covenant, but live &s;till under the reigning power of the love of the world, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to God and Christ. So that the words of their public profe&s;&s;ion, according to their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> e&s;tabli&s;hed u&s;e, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to be of the nature of any profe&s;&s;ion of go&s;pel faith and repentance,
<PB N="87" REF="049067_0086_10264F84DE041CD0">
or any proper compliance with the covenant: For it is their profe&s;&s;ion, that the words, as u&s;ed, mean no &s;uch thing. The words u&s;ed under the&s;e circum&s;tances, do at lea&s;t fail of be|ing a credible profe&s;&s;ion of the&s;e things.&mdash;I can conceive of no &s;uch virtue in a certain &s;et of words, that it is proper, merely on the making the&s;e &s;ounds, to admit per&s;ons to Chri&s;tian &s;a|craments, without any regard to any pretended meaning of the&s;e &s;ounds: Nor can I think, that any in&s;titution of Chri&s;t has e&s;tabli&s;hed any &s;uch terms of admi&s;&s;ion into the Chri&s;tian Church.&mdash; It does not belong to the controver&s;y between me and my people, how particular or large the pro|fe&s;&s;ion &s;hould be, that is required. I &s;hould not chu&s;e to be confined to exact limits as to that matter: But rather than contend, I &s;hould content my&s;elf with a few words, briefly expre&s;&s;|ing the cardinal virtues or acts implied in a hearty compliance with the covenant, made (as &s;hould appear by inquiry into the per&s;on's doc|trinal knowledge) under&s;tandingly; if there were an external conver&s;ation agreeable thereto: Yea, I &s;hould think, that &s;uch a per&s;on, &s;olemnly mak|ing &s;uch a profe&s;&s;ion, had a right to be received as the object of a public charity, however he him|&s;elf might &s;cruple his own conver&s;ion, on account of his not remembering the time, not knowing, the method of his conver&s;ion, or finding &s;o much remaining &s;in, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">, (if his own &s;cruples did not hinder his coming to the Lord's table) I &s;hould think the mini&s;ter or church had <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> right to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;uch a profe&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">, though he &s;hould

&s;ay he did not think him&s;elf converted. For I call that a profe&s;&s;ion of godline&s;s, which is a profe&s;&s;ion of the great things wherein godline&s;s con&s;i&s;ts, and not a profe&s;&s;ion of his own opinion of his good e&s;tate."</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Thus far my letter to Mr. Clark.</P>
<P>The council having heard that I had made certain draughts of the covenant, or forms of a public profe&s;&s;ion of religion which I &s;tood ready to accept of from the candidates for church communion, they, for their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> information, &s;ent for them. Accordingly I &s;ent them four di&s;tinct draughts or forms, which I had drawn up about a twelvemonth before, as what I &s;tood ready to accept of (any one of them) rather than contend, and brake with my people.</P>
<P>The two &s;horte&s;t of the&s;e forms are here in&s;erted for the &s;atisfaction of the reader. They are as follows.</P>
<P>"I hope I do truly find a heart to give up my&s;elf wholly to God, according to the tenor of that covenant of grace which was &s;ealed in my bapti&s;m; and to walk in a way of that obediance to all the commandments of God, which the covenant of grace requires, as long as I live."</P>
<P>Another,</P>
<P>"I hope I truly find in my heart a willingne&s;s to comply with all the commandments of God which re|quire me to give up my&s;elf wholly to him, and to &s;erve him with my body and my &s;pirit. And do accordingly now promi&s;e to walk in a way of obedience to all the commandments of God, as long as I live."</P>
<P>Such kind of profe&s;&s;ions as the&s;e I &s;tood ready to ac|cept, rather than contend and break with my people. Not but that I think it much more convenient, that ordinarily the public profe&s;&s;ion of religion that is made
<PB N="89" REF="049067_0088_10264F8DA9A4F708">
by Chri&s;tians, &s;hould be much fuller and more particular. And that (as I hinted in my letter to Mr Clark) I &s;hould not chu&s;e to be tied up to any certain form of words, but to have liberty to vary the expre&s;&s;ions of a public profe&s;sion, the more exactly to &s;uit the &s;entiments and experience of the profe&s;&s;or, that it might be a more ju&s;t and free expre&s;sion of what each one finds in his heart.</P>
<P>And moreover it mu&s;t be noted, that I ever in&s;i&s;ted on it, that it belonged to me as a pa&s;tor, before a profe&s;&s;ion was accepted, to have full liberty to in&s;truct the candi|date in the meaning of the terms of it, and in the nature of the things propo&s;ed to be profe&s;&s;ed; and to inquire into his doctrinal under&s;tanding of the&s;e things, accord|ing to my be&s;t di&s;cretion; and to caution the per&s;on, as I &s;hould think needful, again&s;t ra&s;hne&s;s in making &s;uch a profe&s;&s;ion, or doing it mainly for the credit of him&s;elf or his family, or from any &s;ecular views what&s;oever, and to put him on &s;erious &s;elf-examination, and &s;earching his own heart, and prayer to God to &s;earch and enlighten him, that he may not be hypocritical and deceived in the profe&s;&s;iom he makes; withal pointing forth to him the many ways in which profe&s;&s;ors are liable to be deceiv|ed.</P>
<P>Nor do I think it improper for a mini&s;ter in &s;uch a ca&s;e, to inquire and know of the candidate what can be remembered of the circum&s;tances of his Chri&s;tian expe|rience; as this may tend much to illu&s;trate his profe&s;|&s;ion, and give a mini&s;ter great advantage for proper in|&s;tructions: though a particular knowledge and remem|brance of the time and method of the fir&s;t conver&s;ion to God, is not to be made the te&s;t of a per&s;on's &s;incerity, nor in&s;i&s;ted on as nece&s;&s;ary in order to his being received into full charity. Not that I think it at all improper or unprofitable, that in &s;ome &s;pecial ca&s;es, a declaration of the particular circum&s;tances of a per&s;on's fir&s;t awake|ning, and the manner of his convictions, illuminations, and comforts, &s;hould be publicly exhibited before the whole congregation, on occa&s;ion of his admi&s;&s;ion into the church; though this be not demanded as nece&s;&s;ary to
<PB N="90" REF="049067_0089_10264F91359A4E28">
admi&s;&s;ion. I ever declared again&s;t in&s;i&s;ting on a rela|tion of experiences, in this &s;en&s;e (viz. a relation of the particular time and &s;teps of the operation of the Spirit, in fir&s;t conver&s;ion,) as the term of communion: Yet, if by a relation of experiences, be meant a declaration of experience of the great things wrought, wherein true grace and the e&s;&s;ential acts and habits of holine&s;s con|&s;i&s;t&punc; in this &s;en&s;e, I think an account of a per&s;on's ex|periences nece&s;&s;ary in order to his admi&s;&s;ion into full communion in the church. But that in whatever in|quiries are made, and whatever account is given, neither mini&s;ter nor church are to &s;et up them&s;elve&s;s as &s;earch|ers, of hearts, but are to accept the &s;erious &s;olemn pro|fe&s;&s;ion of the well-in&s;tructed profe&s;&s;or, of a good life, as be&s;t able to determine what he finds in his own heart.</P>
<P>The&s;e things may &s;erve in &s;ome mea&s;ure to &s;et right tho&s;e of my readers who have been mi&s;led in their ap|prehen&s;ions of the &s;tate of the controver&s;y between me and my people, by the forementioned mi&s;repre&s;entations.</P>

<HEAD>A FAREWELL SERMON.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>2 COR. i.14.</HI></BIBL>
<P>As al&s;o you have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye al&s;o are ours in the day of the Lord Je&s;us.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE apo&s;tle, in the preceding part of the chapter, declares what great troubles he met with in the cour&s;e of his mini&s;try. In the text, and two foregoing ver&s;es, he declares what were his comforts and &s;upports under the troubles he met with. There are four things in particular.</P>
<P N="1">1. That he had approved him&s;elf to his own con&s;cience, ver&s;. 12. "For our rejoic|ing is this, the te&s;timony of our con|&s;cience, that in &s;implicity and godly &s;in|cerity, not with fle&s;hly wi&s;dom, but by the grace of God, we have had our con|ver&s;ation in the world, and more abun|dantly to you-wards."</P>
<P N="2">2. Another thing he &s;peaks of as matter of comfort, is, that as he had approved him&s;elf to his own con&s;cience, &s;o he had al&s;o to the con&s;ciences of his hearers, the Corinthians, whom he now wrote to&punc; and that they &s;hould approve of him at the day of judgment.</P>
<P N="3">3. The hope he had of &s;eeing the ble&s;&s;ed fruit of his labours and &s;ufferings in the mini&s;try, in their happine&s;s and glory, in that great day of accounts.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="92" REF="049067_0091_10264F9659905B78">4. That, in his mini&s;try among the Co|rinthians, he had approved him&s;elf to his Judge, who would approve and reward his faithfulne&s;s in that day.</P>
<P>The&s;e three la&s;t particulars are &s;ignified in my text, and the preceding ver&s;e; and indeed all the four are implied in the text: it is implied, that the Corinthians had ac|knowledged him as their &s;piritual Father, &amp; as one that had been faithful among them, and as the means of their future joy and glory at the day of judgment, and one whom they &s;hould then &s;ee, and have a joy|ful meeting with as &s;uch. It is implied, that the apo&s;tle expected at that time to have a joyful meeting with them before the Judge, and with joy to behold their glory, as the fruit of his labours; and &s;o they would be his rejoicing. It is implied al&s;o, that he then expected to be approved of the great Judge, when he and they &s;hould meet together before him; and that he would then acknowledge his fidelity, and that this had been the means of their glory; and that thus he would, as it were, give them to him as his crown of rejoic|ing. But this the apo&s;tle could not hope for, unle&s;s he had the te&s;timony of his own con&s;cience in his favour. And therefore the words do imply, in the &s;tronge&s;t man|ner, that he had approved him&s;elf to his own con&s;cience.</P>
<P>There is one thing implied in each of
<PB N="93" REF="049067_0092_10264F98E6F66168">
the&s;e particulars, and in every part of the text, which is that point I &s;hall make the &s;ubject of my pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e, viz.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE.</HEAD>
<P>"Mini&s;ters, and the people that have been under their care, mu&s;t meet one an|other before Chri&s;t's tribunal at the day of judgment."</P>
<P>Mini&s;ters, and the people that have been under their care, mu&s;t be parted in this world, how well &s;oever they have been united: If they are not &s;eparated before, they mu&s;t be parted by death; and they may be &s;eparated while life is continued. We live in a world of change, where nothing is certain or &s;table; and where a little time, a few revolutions of the &s;un, brings to pa&s;s &s;trange things, &s;urpri&s;ing al|terations, in particular per&s;ons, in families, in towns and churches, in countries and nations. It often happens, that tho&s;e who &s;eem mo&s;t united, in a little time are mo&s;t di&s;united, and at the greate&s;t di&s;tance.&mdash; Thus mini&s;ters and people, between whom there has been the greate&s;t mutual regard and &s;tricte&s;t union, may not only differ in their judgments, and be alienated in af|fection, but one may rend from the other, and all relation between them be di&s;&s;olved; the mini&s;ter may be removed to a di&s;tant place, and they may never have any more
<PB N="94" REF="049067_0093_10264F9A6E4CFB48">
to do one with another, in this world.&mdash; But if it be &s;o, there is one meeting more that they mu&s;t have, and that is in the la&s;t great day of accounts.</P>
<P>Here I would &s;hew,</P>
<P N="1">I. In what manner mini&s;ters, and the people which have been under their care, &s;hall meet one another at the day of judg|ment.</P>
<P N="2">II. For what purpo&s;es.</P>
<P N="3">III. For what rea&s;ons God has &s;o order|ed it, that mini&s;ters and their people &s;hall then meet together in &s;uch a manner, and for &s;uch purpo&s;es.</P>
<P N="1">I. I would &s;hew, in &s;ome particulars, in what manner mini&s;ters and the people which have been under their care, &s;hall meet one another at the day of judgment. Concerning this, I would ob&s;erve two things in general.</P>
<P N="1">1. That they &s;hall not then meet only as all mankind mu&s;t then meet, but there will be &s;omething peculiar in the manner of their meeting.</P>
<P N="2">2. That their meeting together at that time &s;hall be very different from what u&s;ed to be in the hou&s;e of God in this world.</P>
<P N="1">1. They &s;hall all not meet at that day mere|ly as all the world mu&s;t then meet togeth|er. I would ob&s;erve a difference in two things.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="95" REF="049067_0094_10264F9D43267520">(1.) As to a clear actual view, and di&s;|tinct knowledge and notice of each other.</P>
<P>Although the whole world will be then pre&s;ent, all mankind of all generations ga|thered in one va&s;t a&s;&s;embly, with all of the angelic nature, both elect and fallen an|gels; yet we need not &s;uppo&s;e that every one will have a di&s;tinct and particular knowledge of each individual of the whole a&s;&s;embled multitude, which will undoubt|edly con&s;i&s;t of many millions of millions. Though it is probable that men's capacities will be much greater than in their pre&s;ent &s;tate&punc; yet they will not be infinite: Though their under&s;tanding and comprehen&s;ion will be va&s;tly extended, yet men will not be deified. There will probably be a very enlarged view that particular per&s;ons will have of the various parts and members of that va&s;t a&s;&s;embly, and &s;o of the proceed|ings of that great day; but yet it mu&s;t needs be, that according to the nature of finite minds, &s;ome per&s;ons and &s;ome things, at that day, &s;hall fall more under the no|tice of particular per&s;ons than others; and this (as we may well &s;uppo&s;e) according as they &s;hall have a nearer concern with &s;ome than others in the tran&s;actions of the day. There will be &s;pecial rea&s;on why tho&s;e who have had &s;pecial concerns to|gether in this world, in their &s;tate of pro|bation, and who&s;e mutual affairs will be then to be tried and judged, &s;hould e&s;pe|cially
<PB N="96" REF="049067_0095_10264FA399A2D208">
be &s;et in one another's view. Thus we may &s;uppo&s;e, that rulers and &s;ubjects, earthly judges and tho&s;e whom they have judged, neighbours who have had mutual conver&s;e, dealings, and conte&s;ts, heads of families and their children and &s;ervants, &s;hall then meet, and in a peculiar di&s;tinction be &s;et together. And e&s;pecially will it be thus with mini&s;ters and their people. It is evident by the text, that the&s;e &s;hall be in each other's view, &s;hall di&s;tinctly know each, other, and &s;hall have particular notice one of another at that time.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) They &s;hall meet together, as having &s;pecial concern one with another in the great tran&s;actions of that day.</P>
<P>Although they &s;hall meet the whole world at that time, yet they will not have any immediate and particular concern with all. Yea, the far greater part of tho&s;e who &s;hall then be gathered together, will be &s;uch as they have had no intercour&s;e with in their &s;tate of probation, and &s;o will have no mu|tual concerns to be judged of. But as to mini&s;ters and the people that have been under their care, they will be &s;uch as have had much immediate concern one with an|other, in matters of the greate&s;t moment that ever mankind have to do one with a|nother in. Therefore they e&s;pecially mu&s;t meet, and be brought together before the Judge, as having &s;pecial concern one with another in the de&s;ign and bu&s;ine&s;s of that great day of accounts.</P>

<P N="2">2. Their meeting at the day of judg|ment will be very diver&s;e from their meet|ings one with another in this world.</P>
<P>Mini&s;ters and their people, while their relation continues, often meet together in this world: They are wont to meet from Sabbath to Sabbath, and at other times, for the public wor&s;hip of God, and ad|mini&s;tration, of ordinances, and the &s;ol|emn &s;ervices of God's hou&s;e: And be&s;ides the&s;e meetings, they have al&s;o occa&s;ions to meet for the determining and managing their eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs, for the exerci&s;e of church-di&s;cipline, and the &s;ettling and adju&s;ting tho&s;e things which concern the purity and good order of public admini&s;|trations. But their meeting at the day of judgment will be exceeding diver&s;e, in its manner and circum&s;tances, from any &s;uch meetings and interviews as they have one with another in the pre&s;ent &s;tate. I would ob&s;erve how, in a few particulars.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) Now they meet together in a pre|paratory mutable &s;tate, but then in an un|changable &s;tate.</P>
<P>Now &s;inners in the congregation meet their mini&s;ter in a &s;tate wherein they are capable of a &s;aving change, capable of be|ing turned, through God's ble&s;&s;ing on the mini&s;trations and labours of their pa&s;tor,
<PB N="98" REF="049067_0097_10264FA522A2B300">
from the power of Satan unto God; and being brought out of a &s;tate of guilt, con|demnation and wrath, to a &s;tate of peace and favour with God, to the enjoyment of the privileges of his children, and a title to their eternal inheritance. And &s;aints now meet their mini&s;ter with great remains of corruption, and &s;ometimes under great &s;piritual difficulties and affliction: And therefore are yet the proper &s;ubjects of means of an happy alteration of their &s;tate, con&s;i&s;ting in a greater freedom from the&s;e things, which they have rea&s;on to hope for in the way of an attendance on ordinances, and of which God is plea&s;ed commonly to make his mini&s;ters the in&s;truments. And mini&s;ters and their people now meet in order to the bringing to pa&s;s &s;uch happy changes; they are the great benefits &s;ought in their &s;olemn meetings in this world.</P>
<P>But when they &s;hall meet together at the day of judgment, it will be far other|wi&s;e. They will not then meet in order to the u&s;e of means for the bringing to ef|fect any &s;uch changes; for they will all meet in an unchangeable &s;tate. Sinners will be in an unchangeable &s;tate: They who then &s;hall be under the guilt and power of &s;in, and have the wrath of God abiding on them, &s;hall be beyond all reme|dy or po&s;&s;ibility of change, and &s;hall meet their mini&s;ters without any hopes of relief or remedy, or getting any good by their
<PB N="99" REF="049067_0098_10264FA7A9DDAAA8">
means. And as for the &s;aints, they will be already perfectly delivered from all their before remaining corruption, temp|tation, and calamities of every kind, and &s;et for ever out of their reach; and no de|liverance, no happy alteration, will re|main to be accompli&s;hed in the way of the u&s;e of means of grace, under the ad|mini&s;trations of mini&s;ters. It will then be pronounced, "He that is unju&s;t, let him be unju&s;t &s;till; and he that is filthy, let him be filthy &s;till; and he that is righteous, let him be righteous &s;till; and he that is holy, let him be holy &s;till."</P>
<P N="2">(2.) Then they &s;hall meet together in a &s;tate of clear, certain, and infallible light.</P>
<P>Mini&s;ters are &s;et as guides and teachers, and are repre&s;ented in Scripture as lights &s;et up in the churches; and in the pre&s;ent &s;tate meet their people from time to time in order to in&s;truct and enlighten them, to correct their mi&s;takes, and to be a voice behind them, when they turn a&s;ide to the right hand or the left, &s;aying, "This is the way, walk in it;" to evince end confirm the truth by exhibiting the proper evidences of it, &amp; to refute errors &amp; corrupt opinions, to convince the erroneous, and e&s;tabli&s;h the doubting. But when Chri&s;t &s;hall come to judgment, every error &amp; fal&s;e opinion &s;hall be detected; all deceit &amp; delu&s;ion &s;hall van|i&s;h away before the light of that day, as the darkne&s;s of the night vani&s;hes at the appear|ance

of the ri&s;ing &s;un; and every doctrine of the word of God &s;hall then appear in full evidence, and none &s;hall remain unconvin|ced; all &s;hall know the truth with the greate&s;t certainty, and there &s;hall be no mi&s;takes to rectify.</P>
<P>Now mini&s;ters and their people may di&s;agree in their judgements concerning &s;ome matters of religion, and may &s;ome|times meet to confer together concerning tho&s;e things wherein they differ, and to hear the rea&s;ons that may be offered on one &s;ide and the other; and all may be in|effectual as to any conviction of the truth: they may meet and part again no more a|greed than before; and that &s;ide which was in the wrong, may remain &s;o &s;till: Sometimes the meetings of mini&s;ters with their people, in &s;uch a ca&s;e of di&s;agreeing &s;entiments, are attended with unhappy de|bate and controver&s;y, managed with much prejudice and want of candour: not tend|ing to light and conviction&punc; but rather to confirm and increa&s;e darkne&s;s, and e&s;tab|li&s;h oppo&s;ition to the truth, and alienation of affection one from another. But when they &s;hall hereafter meet together, at the day of judgment, before the tribunal of the great Judge, the mind and will of Chri&s;t will be made known; and there &s;hall no longer be any debate or difference of opinions; the evidence of the truth &s;hall appear beyond all di&s;pute, and all
<PB N="101" REF="049067_0100_10264FADCC9348B8">
controver&s;ies &s;hall be finally and for ever decided.</P>
<P>Now mini&s;ters meet their people in ord|er to enlighten and awaken the con&s;ciences of &s;inners; &s;etting before them the great evil and danger of &s;in, the &s;trictne&s;s of God's law, their own wickedne&s;s of heart and practice, the great guilt they are un|der, the wrath that abides upon them, and their impotence, blindne&s;s, poverty, and helple&s;s and undone condition: But all is often in vain; they remain &s;till, notwith|&s;tanding all their mini&s;ters can &s;ay, &s;tupid and unawakened, and their con&s;ciences unconvinced. But it will not be &s;o at their la&s;t meeting at the day of judgment; &s;inners, when they &s;hall meet their mini&s;|ter before their great Judge, will not meet him with a &s;tupid con&s;cience: They will then be fully convinced of the truth of tho&s;e things which they formerly heard from him, concerning the greatne&s;s and ter|rible maje&s;ty of God, his holine&s;s, and ha|tred of &s;in, and his awful ju&s;tice in pun|i&s;hing of it, the &s;trictne&s;s of his law, and the dreadfulne&s;s and truth of his threaten|ings, and their own un&s;peakable guilt and mi&s;ery: And they &s;hall never more be in|&s;en&s;ible of the&s;e things: The eyes of con|&s;cience will now be fully enlightened, and never &s;hall be blinded again: The mouth of con&s;cience &s;hall now be opened, and never &s;hall be &s;hut any more.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="049067_0101_10264FAF53F8BB60">Now mini&s;ters me<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> with their people, in public and private, in order to enlight|en them concerning the &s;tate of their &s;ouls; to open and apply the rules of God's word to them, in order to their &s;earching their own hearts, and di&s;cerning the &s;tate that they are in: But now mini&s;ters have no infallible di&s;cerning the &s;tate of the &s;ouls of their people; and the mo&s;t &s;kilful of them are liable to mi&s;takes, and often are mi&s;taken in things of this nature: nor are the people able certainly to know the &s;tate of their mini&s;ter, or another's &s;tate; very often tho&s;e pa&s;s among them for &s;aints, and, it may be, eminent &s;aints, that are grand hypocrites; and on the other hand, tho&s;e are &s;ometimes cen&s;ured&punc; or hardly re|ceived into their charity, that are indeed &s;ome of God's jewels. And nothing is more common than for men to be mi&s;taken concerning their own &s;tate: Many that are abominable to God, and the children of his wrath, think highly of them&s;elves, as his precious &s;aints and dear children. Yea, there is rea&s;on to think, that often &s;ome that are mo&s;t bold in their confidence of their &s;afe and happy &s;tate, and think them&s;elves not only true &s;aints, but the mo&s;t eminent &s;aints in the congregation, are in a peculiar manner a &s;moke in God's no&s;e. And thus it undoubtedly often is in tho&s;e congregations where the word of God is mo&s;t faithfully di&s;pen&s;ed, notwith&s;tanding
<PB N="103" REF="049067_0102_10264FB1D8564920">
all that mini&s;ters can &s;ay in their cleare&s;t explications, and mo&s;t &s;earching applica|tions of the doctrines and rules of God's word to the &s;ouls of their hearers, in their meetings one with another. But in the day of judgment they &s;hall have another &s;ort of meeting; then the &s;ecrets of every heart &s;hall be made manife&s;t, and every man's &s;tate &s;hall be perfectly known. 1 Cor. iv.5. "Therefore judge nothing be|fore the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkne&s;s, and will make man|ife&s;t the coun&s;els of the hearts: And then &s;hall every man have prai&s;e of God." Then none &s;hall be deceived concerning his own &s;tate, nor &s;hall be any more in doubt about it. There &s;hall be an eternal end to all the &s;elf-conceit and vain hopes of deluded hypocrites, and all the doubts and fears of &s;incere Chri&s;tians.&mdash; And then &s;hall all know the &s;tate of one another's &s;ouls: The people &s;hall know whether their mini&s;ter has been &s;incere and faithful, and the mini&s;ter &s;hall know the &s;tate of every one of their people, and to whom the word and ordinances of God have been a &s;avour of life unto life, and to whom a &s;avour of death unto death.</P>
<P>Now in this pre&s;ent &s;tate it often hap|pens, that when mini&s;ters and people meet together to debate and manage their eccle|&s;ia&s;tical affairs, e&s;pecially in a &s;tate of con|trover&s;y,
<PB N="104" REF="049067_0103_10264FB58483E240">
they are ready to judge and cen|&s;ure one another with regard to each others views and de&s;igns, and the principles and ends that each is influenced by; and are greatly mi&s;taken in their judgement, and wrong one another in their cen&s;ures: But at that future meeting, things will be &s;et in a true and perfect light, and the princi|ples and aims that every one has acted from, &s;hall be certainly known; and there will be an end to all errors of this kind, and all unrighteous cen&s;ures.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) In this world, mini&s;ters and their people often meet together to hear of and wait upon an un&s;een Lord; but at the day of judgment, they &s;hall meet in his mo&s;t immediate and vi&s;ible pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>Mini&s;ters, who now often meet their people to preach to them the King eter|nal, immortal, and invi&s;ible, to convince them that there is a God, and declare to them what manner of being he is, and to convince them that he governs, and will judge the world, and that there is a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments, and to preach to them a Chri&s;t in heaven, at the right hand of God, in an un&s;een world, &s;hall then meet their people in the mo&s;t immediate &s;en&s;ible pre&s;ence of this great God, Saviour, and Judge, appearing in the mo&s;t plain, vi&s;ible, and open manner, with great glory, with all his holy angels&punc; be|fore them and the whole world. They

&s;hall not meet them to hear about an ab|&s;ent Chri&s;t, an un&s;een Lord, and future Judge; but to appear before that Judge, and as being &s;et together in the pre&s;ence of that &s;upreme Lord, in his immen&s;e glory and awful maje&s;ty, whom they have heard &s;o often of, in their meetings together on earth.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) The meeting at the la&s;t day, of min|i&s;ters, and the people that have been under their care, will not be attended by any one with a carele&s;s heedle&s;s heart.</P>
<P>With &s;uch an heart are their meetings often attended in this world by many per|&s;ons, having little regard to him whom they pretend unitedly to adore in the &s;ol|emn duties of his public wor&s;hip, taking little heed to their own thoughts or frame of their minds, not attending to the bu&s;i|ne&s;s they are engaged in, or con&s;idering the end for which they are come together.&mdash; But the meeting at that great day will be very different: there will not be one carele&s;s heart, no &s;leeping, no wandering of mind from the great concern of the meeting, no inattentivene&s;s to the bu&s;ine&s;s of the day, no regardle&s;&s;ne&s;s of the pre|&s;ence they are in, or of tho&s;e great things which they &s;hall hear from Chri&s;t at that meeting, or that they formerly heard from him, and of him, by their mini&s;ters, in their meetings in a &s;tate of trial, or which they &s;hall now hear their mini&s;ters declar|ing

concerning them before their judge.</P>
<P>Having ob&s;erved the&s;e things, concern|ing the manner and circum&s;tances of this future meeting of mini&s;ters and the people that have been under their care, before the tribunal of Chri&s;t at the day of judg|ment, I now proceed,</P>
<P N="2">II. To ob&s;erve to what purpo&s;es they &s;hall then meet.</P>
<P N="1">1. To give an account, before the great Judge, of their behaviour one to another, in the relation they &s;tood in to each other in this world.</P>
<P>Mini&s;ters are &s;ent forth by Chri&s;t to their people on his bu&s;ine&s;s, are his &s;erv|ants and me&s;&s;engers; and, when they have fini&s;hed their &s;ervice, they mu&s;t return to their ma&s;ter to give him an account of what they have done, and of the enter|tainment they have had in performing their mini&s;try. Thus we find, in Luke, xiv.16.&mdash;21. That when the &s;ervant who was &s;ent forth to call the gue&s;ts to the great &s;upper, had done his errand, and fini&s;hed his appointed &s;ervice, he returned to his ma&s;ter, and gave him an account of what he had done, and of the entertain|ment he had received. And when the ma&s;ter, being angry, &s;ent his &s;ervant to others, he returns again, and gives his ma&s;ter an account of his conduct and &s;uc|ce&s;s. So we read, in Heb. xiii.17. of mini&s;ters or rulers in the hou&s;e of God,
<PB N="107" REF="049067_0106_10264FBC247148E0">
"that watch for &s;ouls, as tho&s;e that mu&s;t give account." And we &s;ee by the forementioned Luke xiv. that mini&s;ters mu&s;t give an account to their ma&s;ter, not only of their own behaviour in the di&s;|charge of their office, but al&s;o of their peo|ples reception of them, and of the treat|ment they have met with among them.</P>
<P>And therefore, as they will be called to give an account of both, they &s;hall give an account at the great day of accounts, in the pre&s;ence of their people; they and their people being both pre&s;ent befor their Judge.</P>
<P>Faithful mini&s;ters will then give an ac|count with joy, concerning tho&s;e who have received them well, and made a good improvement of their mini&s;try; and the&s;e will be given them, at that day, as their crown of rejoicing. And, at the &s;ame time, they will give an account of the ill treatment of &s;uch as have not well receiv|ed them and their me&s;&s;ages from Chri&s;t: they will meet the&s;e, not as they u&s;ed to do in this world, to coun&s;el and warn them, but to bear witne&s;s again&s;t them; and as their judges, and a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors with Chri&s;t, to condemn them. And, on the other hand, the people will, at that day, ri&s;e up in judgment again&s;t wicked and unfaithful mini&s;ters, who have &s;ought their own temporal intere&s;t more than the good of the &s;ouls of their flock.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="108" REF="049067_0107_10264FBFC8A25F78">2. At that time mini&s;ters, and the peo|ple who have been under their care, &s;hall meet together before Chri&s;t, that he may judge between them, as to any controver|&s;ies which have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between them in this world.</P>
<P>So it very often comes to pa&s;s in this evil world, that great differences and con|trover&s;ies ari&s;e between mini&s;ters and the people that are under their pa&s;toral care. Though they are under the greate&s;t obli|gations to live in peace, above per&s;ons in almo&s;t any relation whatever; and altho' conte&s;ts and di&s;&s;entions between per&s;ons &s;o related are the mo&s;t unhappy and terrible in their con&s;equences, on many accounts, of any &s;ort of contentions; yet how fre|quent have &s;uch contentions been? Some|times a people conte&s;t with their mini&s;ters about their doctrine, &s;ometimes about their admini&s;trations and conduct, and &s;ome|times about their maintenance; and &s;ome|times &s;uch conte&s;ts continue a long time; and &s;ometimes they are decided in this world, according to the prevailing intere&s;t of one party or the other, rather than by the word of God, and the rea&s;on of things; and &s;ometimes &s;uch controver&s;ies never have any proper determination in this world.</P>
<P>But at the day of judgement there will be a full, perfect, and everla&s;ting deci&s;ion of them&punc; The infalliable Judge, the infi|nite
<PB N="109" REF="049067_0108_10264FC27295C0B8">
fountain of light, truth, and ju&s;tice, will judge between the contending parties, and will declare what is the truth, who is in the right, and what is agreeable to his mind and will. And in order hereto, the parties mu&s;t &s;tand together before him at the la&s;t day; which will be the great day of fini&s;hing and determining all contro|ver&s;ies, rectifying all mi&s;takes, and abol|i&s;hing all unrighteous judgments, errors, and confu&s;ions, which have before &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ed in the world of mankind.</P>
<P N="3">3. Mini&s;ters, and the people that have been under their care, mu&s;t meet together at that time to receive an eternal &s;entence and retribution from the Judge, in the pre&s;ence of each other, according to their behaviour in the relation they &s;tood in, one to another in the pre&s;ent &s;tate.</P>
<P>The Judge will not only declare ju&s;tice, but he will do ju&s;tice between mini&s;ters and their people. He will declare what is right between them, approving him that has been ju&s;t and faithful, and condemn|ing the unju&s;t; and perfect truth and equity &s;hall take place in the &s;entence which he pa&s;&s;es, in the rewards he be|&s;tows, and the puni&s;hments which he in|flicts. There &s;hall be a glorious reward to faithful mini&s;ters; to tho&s;e who have been &s;ucce&s;sful. Dan. xii.3. "And they that be wi&s;e &s;hall &s;hine as the bright|ne&s;s of the firmament, and they that
<PB N="110" REF="049067_0109_10264FC4FB1A66D0">
turn many to righteou&s;ne&s;s, as the &s;tars for|ever and ever:" And al&s;o to tho&s;e who have been faithful, and yet not &s;ucce&s;s|ful; I&s;ai. xlix.4. "Then I &s;aid, I have laboured in vain, I have &s;pent my &s;trength for nought; yet &s;urely my judgment is with the Lord, and my reward with my God." And tho&s;e who have well receiv|ed and entertained them &s;hall be gloriou&s;ly rewarded; Matth. x.40.41. "He that receiveth you, receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that &s;ent me. He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet, &s;hall receive a prophet's re|ward; and he that receiveth a righteous man, in the name of a righteous man, &s;hall receive a righteous man's reward." Such people, and their faithful mini&s;ters, &s;hall he each other's crown of rejoicing. 1 The&s;. ii.19.20. "For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the pre&s;ence of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t at his coming? For ye are our glory and joy." And in the text, <HI>We are your rejoicing, as ye al&s;o are ours, in the day of the Lord Je&s;us.</HI> But they that evil-intreat Chri&s;t's faithful mini&s;ters&punc; e&s;pecially in that wherein they are faithful, &s;hall be &s;e|verely puni&s;hed; Matth. x.14.15. "And who&s;oever &s;hall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that hou&s;e or city, &s;hake off the du&s;t of your feet. Verily I &s;ay unto you, It &s;hall be more tolerable for the &s;inners of Sodom
<PB N="111" REF="049067_0110_10264FC6ABBAAFD8">
and Gomorrah, in the day of judgment, than for that city." Deut. xxxiii.8.&mdash; 11. "And of Levi he &s;aid&punc; Let thy Thum|mim and thy Urim be with thy holy one. &mdash;They &s;hall teach Jacob thy judgments, and I&s;rael thy law&mdash;ble&s;s, Lord, his &s;ub|&s;tance, and accept the work of his hands&punc; &s;mite through the loins of them that ri&s;e again&s;t him, and of them that hate him, that they ri&s;e not again." On the other hand, tho&s;e mini&s;ters who are found to have been unfaithful, &s;hall have a mo&s;t terrible puni&s;hment. See Ezek. xxxiii.6. Matth. xxiii.1.&mdash;3<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P>Thus ju&s;tice &s;hall be admini&s;tered at the great day to mini&s;ters and their people: And to that end they &s;hall meet together, that they may not only receive ju&s;tice to them&s;elves&punc; but &s;ee ju&s;tice done to the other party: For this is the end of that great day, to reveal or declare the righteous judgment of God; Rom. ii.5. Mini&s;ters &s;hall have ju&s;tice done them, and they &s;hall &s;ee ju&s;tice done to their people: And the people &s;hall receive ju&s;tice them&s;elves from their Judge, and &s;hall &s;ee ju&s;tice done to their mini&s;ter.&mdash; And &s;o all things will be adju&s;ted and &s;et|tled for ever between them&punc; every one being &s;entenced and recompen&s;ed accord|ing to his works, either in receiving and wearing a crown of eternal joy and glory, or in &s;uffering everla&s;ting &s;hame and pain.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="049067_0111_10264FCA710A94A8">I come now to the next thing propo&s;|ed, viz.</P>
<P N="3">III. To give &s;ome rea&s;ons why we may &s;uppo&s;e God has &s;o ordered it, that mini&s;|ters, and the people that have been under their care, &s;hall meet together at the day of judgment, in &s;uch a manner and for &s;uch purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>There are two things which I would now ob&s;erve.</P>
<P N="1">1. The mutual concerns of mini&s;ters and their people are of the greate&s;t im|portance.</P>
<P>The Scripture declares, that God will bring every work into judgment, with every &s;ecret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil. It is fit that all the concerns, and all the behaviour of man|kind, both public and private, &s;hould be brought at la&s;t before God's tribunal, and finally determined by an infallible Judge&punc; But it is e&s;pecially requi&s;ite that it &s;hould be thus, as to affairs of very great impor|tance.</P>
<P>Now the mutual concerns of a Chri&s;tian mini&s;ter and his church and congregation, are of the va&s;te&s;t importance: in many re&s;pects&punc; of much greater moment than the temporal concerns of the greate&s;t earthly monarchs, and their kingdoms or empires. It is of va&s;t con&s;equence how mini&s;ters di&s;charge their office, and conduct them&s;elves towards their people in the
<PB N="113" REF="049067_0112_10264FCCF458E8D0">
work of the mini&s;try, and in affairs apper|taining to it. It is al&s;o a matter of va&s;t importance, how a people receive and en|tertain a faithful mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, and what improvement they make of his min|i&s;try. The&s;e things have a more immedi|ate and direct re&s;pect to the great and la&s;t end for which man was made, and the eternal welfare of mankind, than any of the temporal concerns of men, whether public or private. And therefore it is e&s;|pecially fit that the&s;e affairs &s;hould be brought into judgment, and openly de|termined and &s;ettled in truth and right|eou&s;ne&s;s; and that to this end, mini&s;ters and their people &s;hould meet together be|fore the omni&s;cient and infallible Judge.</P>
<P N="2">2. The mutual concerns of mini&s;ters and their people have a &s;pecial relation to the main things appertaining to the day of judgment.</P>
<P>They have a &s;pecial relation to that great and divine per&s;on who then will ap|pear as Judge. Mini&s;ters are his me&s;&s;en|gers, &s;ent forth by him; and, in their of|fice and admini&s;trations among their peo|ple, repre&s;ent his per&s;on, &s;tand in his &s;tead, as tho&s;e that are &s;ent to declare his mind, to do his work, and to &s;peak and act in his name: And therefore it is e&s;pecial|ly fit that they &s;hould return to him to give an account of their work and &s;ucce&s;s. The king is judge of all his &s;ubjects, they
<PB N="114" REF="049067_0113_10264FCE79DDD3D8">
are all accountable to him: But it is more e&s;pecially requi&s;ite that the king's mini&s;|ters, who are e&s;pecially intru&s;ted with the admini&s;trations of his kingdom, and that are &s;ent forth on &s;ome &s;pecial negociation, &s;hould return to him, to give an account of them&s;elves, and their di&s;charge of their tru&s;t, and the reception they have met with.</P>
<P>Mini&s;ters are not only me&s;&s;engers of the per&s;on who at the la&s;t day will appear as Judge, but the errand they are &s;ent upon, and the affairs they have committed to them as his mini&s;ters, do mo&s;t immediate|ly concern his honour, and the intere&s;t: of his kingdom: The work they are &s;ent up|on is to promote the de&s;igns of his admin|i&s;tration and government; and therefore their bu&s;ine&s;s with their people has a near relation to the day of judgment&punc; for the great end of that day is completely to &s;et|tle and e&s;tabli&s;h the affairs of his kingdom, to adju&s;t all things that pertain to it, that every thing that is oppo&s;ite to the intere&s;ts of his kingdom may be removed, and that every thing which contributes to the com|pletene&s;s and glory of it may be perfected and confirmed, that this great King may receive his due honour and glory.</P>
<P>Again, the mutual concerns of mini&s;ters and their people have a direct relation to the concerns of the day of judgment, as the bu&s;ine&s;s of mini&s;ters with their peo|ple
<PB N="115" REF="049067_0114_10264FD10B8D32F8">
is to promote the eternal &s;alvation of the &s;ouls of men, and their e&s;cape from eternal damnation; and the day of judg|ment is the day appointed for that end, openly to decide and &s;ettle men's eternal &s;tate, to fix &s;ome in a &s;tate of eternal &s;alva|tion, and to bring their &s;alvation to its ut|mo&s;t con&s;ummation, and to fix others in a &s;tate of everla&s;ting damnation and mo&s;t perfect mi&s;ery. The mutual concerns of mini&s;ters and people have a mo&s;t direct relation to the day of judgment, as the very de&s;ign of the work of the mini&s;try is the people's preparation for that day: Mini&s;ters are &s;ent to warn them of the ap|proach of that day, to forewarn them of the dreadful &s;entence then to be pronounc|ed on the wicked, and declare to them the ble&s;&s;ed &s;entence then to be pronounced on the righteous, and to u&s;e means with them that they may e&s;cape the wrath which is then to come on the ungodly, and obtain the reward then to be be&s;towed on the &s;aints.</P>
<P>And as the mutual concerns of mini&s;ters and their people have &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ear and direct a relation to that day, it is e&s;pecially fit that tho&s;e concerns &s;hould be brought into that day, and there &s;ettled and i&s;&s;ued; and that in order to this, mini&s;ters and their people &s;hould meet and appear together before the great Judge at that day.</P>

<P>The improvement I would make of the things which have been ob&s;erved, is to lead the people here pre&s;ent, who have been under my pa&s;toral care, to &s;ome re|flections, and give them &s;ome advice &s;uita|ble to our pre&s;ent circum&s;tances; relating to what has been lately done in order to our being &s;eparated, as to the relation we have heretofore &s;tood in one to another; but expecting to meet each other before the great tribunal at the day of judgment.</P>
<P>The deep and &s;erious con&s;ideration of that our future mo&s;t &s;olemn meeting, is certainly mo&s;t &s;uitable at &s;uch a time as this&punc; there having &s;o lately been that done, which, in all probability, will (as to the relation we have heretofore &s;tood in) be followed with an everla&s;ting &s;eparation.</P>
<P>How often have we met together in the hou&s;e of God in this relation? how often have I &s;poken to you, in&s;tructed, coun&s;el|led, warned, directed, and fed you, and admini&s;tered ordinances among you, as the people which were committed to my care, and who&s;e precious &s;ouls I had the charge of? but in all probability, this ne|ver will be again.</P>
<P>The prophet Jeremiah, (chap. xxxv.3.) puts the people in mind how long he had laboured among them in the work of the mini&s;try: "From the thirteenth year of Jo&s;iah, the &s;on of Amon, king of Judah,
<PB N="117" REF="049067_0116_10264FD7707F6F90">
even unto this day (that is, the three and twentieth year) the word of the Lord came unto me, and I have &s;poken unto you, ri|&s;ing early and &s;peaking." I am not about to compare my&s;elf with the prophet Jere|miah; but in this re&s;pect I can &s;ay as he did, that "I have &s;poken the word of God to you, unto the three and twentieth year, ri&s;ing early and &s;peaking." It was three and twenty years, the 15th day of la&s;t Februray, &s;ince I have laboured in the work of the mini&s;try, in the relation of a pa&s;tor to this church and congregation.&mdash; And though my &s;trength has been weak|ne&s;s, having always laboured under great infirmity of body, be&s;ides my in&s;ufficiency for &s;o great a charge in other re&s;pects, yet I have not &s;pared my feeble &s;trength, but have exerted it for the good of your &s;ouls. I can appeal to you, as the apo&s;tle does to his hearers, Gal. iv.13. "Ye know how through infirmity of the fle&s;h, I preached the go&s;pel unto you." I have &s;pent the prime of my life and &s;trength in labours for your eternal welfare. You are my witne&s;&s;es, that what &s;trength I have had, I have not neglected in idlene&s;s, nor laid out in pro&s;ecuting worldly &s;chemes, and managing temporal affairs, for the ad|vancement of my outward e&s;tate, and ag|grandizing my&s;elf and family; but have given my&s;elf to the work of the mini&s;try, labouring in it night and day, ri&s;ing early,

and applying my&s;elf to this great bu&s;ine&s;s to which Chri&s;t appointed me. I have found the work of the mini&s;try among you to be a great work indeed, a work of ex|ceeding care, labour, and difficulty: Many have been the heavy burdens that I have borne in it, which my &s;trength has been very unequal to. God called me to bear the&s;e burdens; and I ble&s;s his name, that he has &s;o &s;upported me as to keep me from &s;inking under them, and that his power herein has been manife&s;ted in my weak|ne&s;s; &s;o that although I have often been troubled on every &s;ide, yet I have not been di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; perplexed, but not in de&s;|pair; ca&s;t down, but not de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>But now I have rea&s;on to think my work is fini&s;hed which I had to do as your mini&s;ter: You have publicly reject|ed me, and my opportunities cea&s;e.</P>
<P>How highly, therefore, does it now be|come us, to con&s;ider of that time when we mu&s;t meet one another before the chief Shepherd? When I mu&s;t give an account of my &s;teward&s;hip, of the &s;ervice I have done for, and the reception and treatment I have had among the people he &s;ent me to: And you mu&s;t give an account of your own conduct towards me&punc; and the improvement you have made of the&s;e three and twenty years of my mini&s;try. For then both you and I mu&s;t appear together, and we both mu&s;t give an account, in or+der

to an infallible righteous and eternal &s;entence to be pa&s;&s;ed upon us, by him who will judge us with re&s;pect to all that we have &s;aid or done in our meetings here, all our conduct one towards another, in the hou&s;e of God and el&s;ewhere, on Sab|bath days and on other days; who will try our hearts, and manife&s;t our thoughts, and the principles and frames of our minds, will judge us with re&s;pect to all the controver&s;ies which have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted be|tween us, with the &s;tricte&s;t impartiality, and will examine our treatment of each other in tho&s;e controver&s;ies: There is no|thing covered, that &s;hall not be revealed, nor hid, which &s;hall not be known; all will be examined in the &s;earching pene+trating light of God's omni&s;cience and glory, and by him who&s;e eyes are as a flame of fire; and truth and right &s;hall be made plainly to appear, being &s;tripped of every veil; and all error, fal&s;ehood, un|righteou&s;ne&s;s, and injury &s;hall be laid open, &s;tripped of every di&s;gui&s;e; every &s;pecious pretence, every cavil, and all fal&s;e rea&s;oning, &s;hall vani&s;h in a moment, as not being able to bear the light of that day.&mdash; And then our hearts will be turned in&s;ide out, and the &s;ecrets of them will be made more plainly to appear than our outward actions do now.

which we have acted from, and what have been the di&s;po&s;itions we have exer|erci&s;ed in our eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;putes and conte&s;ts. Then it will appear, whether I acted uprightly, and from a truly con&s;cien|tious careful regard to my duty to my great Lord and Ma&s;ter, in &s;ome former eccle&s;i|a&s;tical controver&s;ies, which have been at|tended with exceeding unhappy circum|&s;tances and con&s;equences: It will appear whether there was any ju&s;t cau&s;e for the re&s;entment which was manife&s;ted on tho&s;e occa&s;ions. And then our late grand con|trover&s;y, concerning the qualifications ne|ce&s;&s;ary for admi&s;&s;ion to the privileges of members, in complete &s;tanding, in the vi|&s;ible church of Chri&s;t, will be examined and judged in all its parts and circum|&s;tances, and the whole &s;et forth in a clear, certain, and perfect light. Then it will appear whether the doctrine which I have preached and publi&s;hed concerning this matter be Chri&s;t's own doctrine, whether he will not own it as one of the precious truths which have proceeded from his own mouth, and vindicate and honour as &s;uch before the whole univer&s;e. Then it will appear what is meant by "the man that comes without the wedding-garment;" for that is the day &s;poken of&punc; Matth. xxii.13. "wherein &s;uch an one &s;hall be bound hand and foot, and ca&s;t into outer dark|ne&s;s, where &s;hall be weeping and gna&s;hing

of teeth." And then it will appear whe|ther, in declaring this doctrine, and act|ing agreeable to it, and in my general con|duct in the affair, I have been influenced from any regard to my own temporal in|tere&s;t, or honour, or de&s;ire to appear wi&s;er than others; or have acted from any &s;in|i&s;ter &s;ecular views what&s;oever; and wheth|er what I have done has not been from a careful, &s;trict, and tender regard to the will of my Lord and Ma&s;ter, and becau&s;e I dare not offend him, being &s;atisfied what his will was, after a long, diligent, impartial, and prayerful inquiry; having this con&s;tantly in view and pro&s;pect, to engage me to great &s;olicitude not ra&s;hly to determine truth to be on this &s;ide of the que&s;tion where I am now per&s;uaded it is, that &s;uch a determination would not be for my temporal intere&s;t, but every way again&s;t it, bringing a long &s;eries of ex|treme difficulties, and plunging me into an aby&s;s of trouble and &s;orrow. And then it will appear whether my people have done their duty to their pa&s;tor with re&s;pect to this matter, whether they have &s;hown a right temper and &s;pirit on this occa&s;ion; whether they have done me ju&s;tice in hearing, attending to, and con|&s;idering what I had to &s;ay in evidence of what I believed and taught as part of the coun&s;el of God&punc; whether I have been treated with that impartiality, candour,

and regard which the ju&s;t judge e&s;teemed due; and whether, in the many &s;teps which have been taken, and the many things that have been &s;aid and done in the cour&s;e of this controver&s;y, righteou&s;ne&s;s, and charity, and Chri&s;tian decorum has been maintained; or if otherwi&s;e, to how great a degree the&s;e things have been vio|lated. Then every &s;tep of the conduct of each of us in this affair, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, and the &s;pirit we have exerci&s;ed in all, &s;hall be examined and manife&s;ted, and our own con&s;ciences will &s;peak plain and loud, and each of us &s;hall be convinced, and the world &s;hall know; and never &s;hall there be any more mi&s;take, mi&s;repre&s;enta|tion, or mi&s;apprehen&s;ion of the affair to eternity.</P>
<P>This controver&s;y is now probably brought to an i&s;&s;ue between you and me as to this world; it has i&s;&s;ued in the e|vent of the week before la&s;t: But it mu&s;t have another deci&s;ion at that great day, which certainly will come, when you and I &s;hall meet together before the great judg|ment-&s;eat: And therefore I leave it to that time, and &s;hall &s;ay no more about it at pre&s;ent.</P>

<P>Henceforward I am like to have no more opportunity to take the care and charge of your &s;ouls, to examine and &s;earch them.

<P>The greater part of you who are profe&s;|&s;ors of godline&s;s have, (to u&s;e the phra&s;e of the apo&s;tle,) "acknowledged me in part:" You have heretofore acknowledged me to be your &s;piritual father, the in&s;tru|ment of the greate&s;t good to you that ever is, or can be obtained by any of the chil|dren of men.

As the relation of a natural parent brings great obliga|tions on children in the &s;ight of God; &s;o much more, in many re&s;pects, does the re|lation of a &s;piritual father bring great ob|ligations on &s;uch who&s;e conver&s;ion and eternal &s;alvation they &s;uppo&s;e God has made them the in&s;truments of: 1 Cor. iv.15.

dying from the wrath to come, and tho|rough in the u&s;e of means for your e&s;cape and &s;afety, I have diligently endeavour|ed to find out and u&s;e the mo&s;t powerful motives to per&s;uade you to take care for your own welfare and &s;alvation. I have not only endeavoured to awaken you, that you might be moved with fear, but I have u&s;ed my utmo&s;t endeavours to win you: I have fought out acceptable words, that if po&s;&s;ible I might prevail upon you to for&s;ake &s;in, and turn to God, and accept of Chri&s;t as your Saviour and Lord.

But yet, with regard to you whom I am now &s;peaking to, I have not been &s;ucce&s;sful: But have this day rea&s;on to complain in tho&s;e words, Jer. vi.29. "The bellows are burnt, the lead is con|&s;umed of the fire, the founder melteth in vain, for the wicked are not plucked away." It is to be feared that all my la|bours, as to many of you, have &s;erved to no other purpo&s;e but to harden you; and that the word which I have preached, in&s;tead of being a favour of life unto life&punc; has been a favour of death unto death. Though I &s;hall not have any account to give for the future of &s;uch as have openly and re&s;o|lutely renounced my mini&s;try, as of a be|tru&s;tment committed to me; yet remem|ber you mu&s;t give account for your&s;elves, of your care of your own &s;ouls, and your

improvement of all means pa&s;t and future, through your whole lives.

May God in mercy grant, that however all pa&s;t means have been un&s;ucce&s;sful, you may have future means which may have a new effect; and that the word of God, as it &s;hall be hereafter di&s;pen&s;ed to you, may prove as the fire and the hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces. However, let me now at parting exhort and be&s;eech you not wholly to forget the warnings you have had while under my mini&s;try.&mdash; When you and I &s;hall meet at the day of judgment, then you will remember them: The &s;ight of me your former mini&s;ter, on that occa&s;ion, will &s;oon revive them in your memory; and that in a very affect|ing manner.

that have been faithful in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. This is a &s;orrowful parting that now is between you and me; but that would be a more &s;orrowful parting to you than this. This you may perhaps bear without being much affected with it, if you are not glad of it; but &s;uch a parting in that day will mo&s;t deeply, &s;en&s;ibly, and dreadfully, af|fect you.</P>

Some of you, that I have rea&s;on to hope are under &s;ome awak|enings, have acquainted me with your circum&s;tances; which has a tendency to cau&s;e me, now I am leaving you, to take my leave of you with peculiar concern for you. What will be the i&s;&s;ue of your pre&s;ent exerci&s;e of mind I know not: But it will be known at that day, when you and I &s;hall meet before the judgment-&s;eat of Chri&s;t. Therefore now be much in con|&s;ideration of that day.</P>
<P>Now I am parting with this flock, I would once more pre&s;s upon you the coun&s;els I have heretofore given, to take heed of being &s;lighty in &s;o great a concern, to be thorough and in good earne&s;t in the
<PB N="130" REF="049067_0129_10264FF7DDEB2248">
affair, and to beware of back&s;liding, to hold on and hold out to the end. And cry mightily to God, that the&s;e great changes that pa&s;s over this church and congregation do not prove your overthrow&punc; There is great temptations in them; and the devil will undoubtedly &s;eek to make his advantage of them, if po&s;&s;ible, to cau&s;e your pre&s;ent convictions and endeavours to be abortive. You had need to double your diligence, and watch and pray, le&s;t you be overcome by temptation.</P>
<P>Whoever may hereafter &s;tand related to you as your &s;piritual guide, my de&s;ire and prayer is, that the great Shepherd of the &s;heep would have a &s;pecial re&s;pect to you, and be your guide, (for there is none teacheth like him,) and that he who is the infinite fountain of light, would "open your eyes, and turn you from darkne&s;s unto light, and from the power of Satan unto God; that you may receive forgive|ne&s;s of &s;ins, and inheritance among them that are &s;anctified, through faith that is in Chri&s;t;" that &s;o, in that great day, when I &s;hall meet you again before your Judge and mine, we may meet in joyful and glo|rious circum&s;tances, never to be &s;eparated any more.</P>
<P N="4">IV. I would apply my&s;elf to the young people of the congregation.</P>
<P>Since I have been &s;ettled in the work of the mini&s;try in this place. I have ever
<PB N="131" REF="049067_0130_10264FFB9A3676E8">
had a perculiar concern for the &s;ouls of the young people, and a de&s;ire that reli|gion might flouri&s;h among them; and have e&s;pecially exerted my&s;elf in order to it; becau&s;e I knew the &s;pecial opportuni|ty they have beyond others, and that ordi|narily tho&s;e whom God intended mercy for were brought to fear and love him in their youth. And it has ever appeared to me a peculiarly amiable thing, to &s;ee young people walking in the ways of vir|tue and Chri&s;tian piety, having their hearts purified and &s;weetened with a principle of divine love. And it has appeared a thing exceeding beautiful, and what would be much to the adorning and happine&s;s of the town, if the young people could be per&s;uaded, when they meet together, to conver&s;e as Chri&s;tians, and as the children of God; avoiding impurity, levity, and extravagance; keeping &s;trictly to rules of virtue, and conver&s;ing together of the things of God, and Chri&s;t, and heaven.&mdash; This is what I have longed for: And it has been exceeding grievous to me when I have heard of vice, vanity, and di&s;order among our youth. And &s;o far as I know my heart, it was from hence that I for|merly led this church to &s;ome mea&s;ures, for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing vice among our young people, which gave &s;o great offence, and by which I became &s;o obnoxious. I have fought the good and not the hurt of our
<PB N="132" REF="049067_0131_10264FFD618CB308">
young people. I have de&s;ired their true&s;t honour and happine&s;s, and not their re|proach; knowing that true virtue and re|ligion tended not only to the glory and felicity of young people in another world, but their greate&s;t peace and pro&s;perity, and highe&s;t dignity and honour, in this world; and above all things to &s;weeten, and render plea&s;ant and delightful, even the days of youth.</P>
<P>But whether I have loved you, and &s;ought your good more or le&s;s, yet God in his providence, now calling me to part with you, committing your &s;ouls to him who once committed the pa&s;toral care of them to me, nothing remains, but only (as I am now taking my leave of you) earne&s;tly to be&s;eech you, from love to your&s;elves, if you have none to me, not to de&s;pi&s;e and forget the warnings and coun&s;els I have &s;o often given you; remembering the day when you and I mo&s;t meet again before the great Judge of quick and dead; when it will appear whether the things I have taught you were true, whether the coun|&s;els I have given you were good, and whether I truly &s;ought your good, and whether you have well improved my endeavours.</P>
<P>I have, from time to time, earne&s;tly warned you again&s;t frolicking (as it is called,) and &s;ome other liberties common|ly taken by young people in the land.&mdash;
<PB N="133" REF="049067_0132_10265000E45CD680">
And whatever &s;ome may &s;ay in ju&s;tifica|tion of &s;uch liberties and cu&s;toms, and may laugh at warnings again&s;t them, I now leave you my parting te&s;timony a|gain&s;t &s;uch things; not doubting but God will approve and confirm it in that day when we &s;hall meet before them.</P>
<P N="5">V. I would apply my&s;elf to the children of the congregation, the lambs of this flock, who have been &s;o long under my care.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;t now &s;aid that I have had a peculiar concern for the young people; and in &s;o &s;aying, I did not intend to ex|clude you. You are in youth, and in the mo&s;t early youth: And therefore I have been &s;en&s;ible, that if tho&s;e that were young had a precious opportunity for their &s;oul's good, you who are very young, had, in many re&s;pects, a peculiarly precious op|portunity. And accordingly I have not neglected you: I have endeavoured to do the part of a faithful &s;hepherd, in feeding the lambs as well as the &s;heep. Chri&s;t did once commit the care of your &s;ouls to me as your mini&s;ter; and you know, dear children, how I have in&s;tructed you, and warned you from time to time: You know how I have often called you together for that end; and &s;ome of you, &s;ometimes, have &s;eemed to be affected with what I have &s;aid to you. But I am afraid it has had no &s;aving effect as to many of you;
<PB N="134" REF="049067_0133_102650036A88BF88">
but that you remain &s;till in an unconvert|ed condition, without any real &s;aving work wrought in your &s;ouls, convincing you thoroughly of your &s;in and mi&s;ery, cau&s;ing you to &s;ee the great evil of &s;in, and to mourn for it, and hate it above all things; and giving you a &s;en&s;e of the ex|cellency of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, bring|ing you with all your hearts to cleave to him as your Saviour, weaning your hearts from the world, and cau&s;ing you to love God above all, and to delight in holine&s;s more than in all the plea&s;ant things of this earth: And &s;o that I now leave you in a mi&s;erable condition, having no intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, and &s;o under the awful di&s;plea&s;ure and anger of God, and in danger of going down to the pit of eternal mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>But now I mu&s;t bid you farewell: I mu&s;t leave you in the hands of God: I can do no more for you than to pray for you. Only I de&s;ire you not to forget, but often think of the coun&s;els and warnings I have given you, and the endeavours I have u&s;ed, that your &s;ouls might be &s;aved from everla&s;ting de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Dear children, I leave you in an evil world, that is full of &s;nares and tempta|tions. God only knows what will become of you. This the Scripture has told us, that there are but few &s;aved; and we have abundant confirmation of it from what we &s;ee. This we &s;ee, that children die as
<PB N="135" REF="049067_0134_10265004F215F1F8">
well as others: Multitudes die before they grow up; and of tho&s;e that grow up, comparatively few ever give good evi|dence of &s;aving conver&s;ion to God. I pray God to pity you, and take care of you, and provide for you the be&s;t means for the good of your &s;ouls; and that God him&s;elf would undertake for you, to be your heavenly Father, and the mighty Re|deemer of your immortal &s;ouls. Do not neglect to pray for your&s;elves: Take heed you be not of the number of tho&s;e who ca&s;t off fear, and re&s;train prayer before God. Con&s;tantly pray to God in &s;ecret; and often remember that great day when you mu&s;t appear before the judgment-&s;eat of Chri&s;t, and meet your mini&s;ter there, who has &s;o often coun&s;elled and warned you.</P>
<P>I conclude with a few words of advice to all in general, in &s;ome particulars, which are of great importance in order to the future welfare and pro&s;perity of this church and congregation.</P>
<P N="1">1. One thing that greatly concerns you, as you would be an happy people, is the maintaining of family order.</P>
<P>We have had great di&s;putes how the church ought to be regulated; and indeed the &s;ubject of the&s;e di&s;putes was of great importance: But the due regulation of your families is of no le&s;s, and, in &s;ome re&s;pects, of much greater importance.&mdash;
<PB N="136" REF="049067_0135_10265008B67DE7C8">
Every Chri&s;tian family ought to be as it were a little church, con&s;ecrated to Chri&s;t, and wholly influenced and governed by his rules. And family education and or|der are &s;ome of the chief of the means of grace. If the&s;e fail, all other means are like to prove ineffectual. If the&s;e are du|ly maintained, all the means of grace will be like to pro&s;per and be &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>Let me now therefore, once more, be|fore I finally cea&s;e to &s;peak to this congre|gation, repeat, and earne&s;tly pre&s;s the coun&s;el which I have often urged on heads of families here, while I was their pa&s;tor, to great painfulne&s;s, in teaching, warning, and directing their children; bringing them up in the nurture and ad|monition of the Lord; beginning early, where there is yet opportunity, and main|taining a con&s;tant diligence in labours of this kind&punc; Remembering that, as you would not have all your in&s;tructions and coun&s;els ineffectual, there mu&s;t be govern|ment as well as in&s;tructions, which mu&s;t be maintained with an even hand, and &s;teady re&s;olution, as a guard to the religion and morals of the family, and the &s;upport of its good order. Take heed that it be not with any of you as it was with Eli of old, who reproved his children, but re|&s;trained them not; and that, by this means, you do not bring the like cur&s;e on your families as he did on his.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="049067_0136_1026500B46FB5A80">And let children obey their parents, and yield to their in&s;tructions, and &s;ubmit to their orders, as they would inherit a ble&s;|&s;ing and not a cur&s;e. For we have rea&s;on to think, from many things in the word of God, that nothing has a greater tendency to bring a cur&s;e on per&s;ons in this world, and on all their temporal concerns, than an undutiful, un&s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, di&s;orderly be|haviour in children towards their parents.</P>
<P N="2">2. As you would &s;eek the future pro&s;|perity of this &s;ociety, it is of va&s;t import|ance that you &s;hould avoid contention.</P>
<P>A contentious people will be a mi&s;erable people. The contentions which have been among you, &s;ince I fir&s;t became your pa&s;tor, have been one of the greate&s;t bur|dens I have laboured under in the cour&s;e of my mini&s;try: Not only the contentions you have had with me, but tho&s;e which you have had one with another, about your lands, and other concerns. Becau&s;e I knew that contention, heat of &s;pirit, evil-&s;peaking, and things of the like na|ture, were directly contrary to the &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity, and did, in a peculiar man|ner, tend to drive away God's Spirit from a people, and to render all means of grace ineffectual, as well as to de&s;troy a people's outward comfort and welfare.</P>
<P>Let me therefore earne&s;tly exhort you, as you would &s;eek your own future good, hereafter to watch again&s;t a contentious
<PB N="138" REF="049067_0137_1026500CCCAFC998">
&s;pirit. "If you would &s;ee good days, &s;eek peace, and en&s;ue it." 1 Pet. iii.10.11. Let the contentions which has lately been about the terms of Chri&s;tian communion, as it has been the greate&s;t of your conten|tion, &s;o be the la&s;t of them. I would, now I am preaching my farewell &s;ermon, &s;ay to you, as the apo&s;tle to the Corinthians, 2 Cor. xiii.11.: "Finally, brethren, fare|well. Be perfect: Be of one mind: Live in peace; and the God of love and peace &s;hall be with you."</P>
<P>And here I would particularly advi&s;e tho&s;e that have adhered to me in the late controver&s;y, to watch over their &s;pirits, and avoid all bitterne&s;s towards others.&mdash; Your temptations are, in &s;ome re&s;pects, the greate&s;t; becau&s;e what has been lately done is grievous to you. But however wrong you may think others have done, maintain, with great diligence and watch|fulne&s;s, a Chri&s;tian meekne&s;s and &s;edate|ne&s;s of &s;pirit; and labour, in this re&s;pect, to excel others who are of the contrary part. And this will be the be&s;t victory: For "he that rules his &s;pirit, is better than he that takes a city." Therefore let nothing be done through &s;trife or vain-glory. Indulge no revengeful &s;pirit in any wi&s;e; but watch and pray again&s;t it: and, by all means in your power, &s;eek the pro&s;perity of this town: And never think you behave your&s;elves as becomes Chri&s;|tians,
<PB N="139" REF="049067_0138_1026500F4CF3FAA0">
but when you &s;incerely, &s;en&s;ibly, and fervently love all men, of whatever par|ty or opinion, and whether friendly or unkind, ju&s;t or injurious, to you or your friends, or to the cau&s;e and kingdom of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another thing that va&s;tly concerns the future pro&s;perity of the town, is, that you &s;hould watch again&s;t the encroach|ments of error; and particularly Armin|iani&s;m, and doctrines of like tendency.</P>
<P>You were, many of you, as I well re|member, much alarmed with the appre|hen&s;ions of the danger of the prevailing of the&s;e corrupt principles, near &s;ixteen years ago. But the danger then was &s;mall in compari&s;on of what appears now. The&s;e doctrines at this day are much more preva|lent than they were then: The progre&s;s they have made in the land, within this &s;even years, &s;eems to have been va&s;tly greater than at any time in the like &s;pace before: And they are &s;till prevailing and creeping into almo&s;t all parts of the land, threatening the utter ruin of the credit of tho&s;e doctrines which are the peculiar glo|ry of the go&s;pel, and the intere&s;ts of vital piety. And I have of late perceived &s;ome things among your&s;elves, that &s;hew that you are far from being out of danger, but on the contrary remarkably expo&s;ed. The older people may perhaps think them&s;elves &s;ufficiently fortified again&s;t infection&punc;
<PB N="140" REF="049067_0139_10265012C8801620">
But it is fit that all &s;hould beware of &s;elf confidence and carnal &s;ecurity, and &s;hould remember tho&s;e needful warnings of &s;acred writ, "Be not high minded, but fear; and let him that &s;tands, take heed le&s;t he fall." But let the ca&s;e of the older people be as it will, the ri&s;ing generation are doubtle&s;s greatly expo&s;ed. The&s;e principles are ex|ceeding taking with corrupt nature, and are what young people, at lea&s;t &s;uch as have not their hearts e&s;tabli&s;hed with grace, are ea&s;ily led away with.</P>
<P>And if the&s;e principles &s;hould greatly prevail in this town, as they very lately have done in another large town I could name, formerly greatly noted for religion, and &s;o for a long time, it will threaten the &s;piritual and eternal ruin of this people, in the pre&s;ent and future generations. There|fore you have need of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t diligent care and watchfulne&s;s with re&s;pect to this matter.</P>
<P N="4">4. Another thing which I would advi&s;e to, that you may hereafter be a pro&s;perous people, is, that you would give your&s;elves much to prayer.</P>
<P>God is the fountain of all be&s;&s;ing and pro&s;perity, and he will be &s;ought to for his ble&s;&s;ing. I would therefore advi&s;e you not only to be con&s;tant in &s;ecret and family prayer, and in the public wor&s;hip of God in his hou&s;e, but al&s;o often to a&s;&s;emble your&s;elves in private praying &s;ocieties. I
<PB N="141" REF="049067_0140_102650154F6B7AB0">
would advi&s;e all &s;uch as are grieved for the afflictions of Jo&s;eph, and &s;en&s;ibly affect|ed with the calamities of this town, of whatever opinon they be with relation to the &s;ubject of our late controver&s;y, often to meet together for prayer, and to cry to God for his mercy to them&s;elves, and mer|cy to this town, and mercy to Zion and the people of God in general through the world.</P>
<P N="5">5. The la&s;t article of advice I would give (which doubtle&s;s does greatly con|cern your pro&s;perity) is, that you would take great care with regard to the &s;ettle|ment of a mini&s;ter, to &s;ee to it who, or what manner of per&s;on he is that you &s;et|tle; and particularly in the&s;e two re&s;pects.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) That he be a man of thoroughly &s;ound principles, in the &s;cheme of doctrine which he maintains.</P>
<P>This you will &s;tand in the greate&s;t need of, e&s;pecially at &s;uch a day of corruption as this is. And in order to obtain &s;uch a one, you had need to exerci&s;e extraordina|ry care and prudence.&mdash;I know the dan|ger. I know the manner of many young gentlemen of corrupt principles, their ways of concealing them&s;elves, the fair &s;pecious di&s;gui&s;es they are wont to put on, by which they deceive others, to main|tain their own credit, and get them&s;elves into others confidence and improvement, and &s;ecure and e&s;tabli&s;h their own intere&s;t,
<PB N="142" REF="049067_0141_10263A6D95F0A748">
until they &s;ee a convenient opportunity to begin more openly to broach and propagate their corrupt tenets.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) Labour to obtain a man who has an e&s;tabli&s;hed character, as a per&s;on of &s;erious religion and fervent piety.</P>
<P>It is of va&s;t importance that tho&s;e who are &s;ettled in this work &s;hould be men of true piety, at all times, and in all places; but more e&s;pecially at &s;ome times, and in &s;ome towns and churches. And this pre|&s;ent time, which is a time wherein reli|gion is in danger, by &s;o many corruptions in doctrine and practice, is in a peculiar manner a day wherein &s;uch mini&s;ters are nece&s;&s;ary. Nothing el&s;e but &s;incere piety of heart is at all to be depended on, at &s;uch a time as this, as a &s;ecurity to a young man, ju&s;t coming into the world, from the pre|vailing infection, or thoroughly to engage him in proper and &s;ucce&s;sful endeavours to with&s;tand and oppo&s;e the torrent of er|ror, and prejudice, again&s;t the high my&s;|terious evangelical doctrines of the religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and their genuine effects in true experimental religion. And this place is a place that does peculiarly need &s;uch a mini&s;ter, for rea&s;ons obvious to all.</P>
<P>If you &s;hould happen to &s;ettle a mini&s;ter who knows nothing truly of Chri&s;t, and the way of &s;alvation by him, nothing experimentally of the nature of vital reli|gion; alas, how will you be expo&s;ed as &s;heep without a &s;hepherd! Here is need of one in this place, who &s;hall be eminently fit to &s;tand in the gap, and make up the
<PB N="143" REF="049067_0142_102650197A636EF8">
hedge, and who &s;hall be as the chariots of I&s;rael, and the hor&s;emen thereof. You need one that &s;hall &s;tand as a champion in the cau&s;e of truth and the power of god|line&s;s.</P>
<P>Having briefly mentioned the&s;e important articles of advice, nothing remains, but that I now take my leave of you, and bid you all, farewell; wi&s;hing and praying for your be&s;t pro&s;perity. I would now commend your immortal &s;ouls to him, who formerly committed them to me, expecting the day, when I mu&s;t meet you again before him, who is the Judge of quick and dead. I de|&s;ire that I may never forget this people, who have been &s;o long my &s;pecial charge, and that I may never cea&s;e fervently to pray for your pro&s;perity. May God ble&s;s you with a faithful pa&s;tor, one that is well acquainted with his mind and will, thoroughly warning &s;inners, wi&s;ely and &s;kilfully &s;earching profe&s;&s;ors, and conducting you in the way to eternal ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. May you have truly a burning and &s;hining light &s;et up in this candle|&s;tick; and may you, not only for a &s;ea&s;on, but during his whole life, and that a long life, be willing to rejoice in his light.</P>
<P>And let me be remembered in the prayers of all God's people that are of a calm &s;pirit, and are peaceable and faithful in I&s;rael, of whatever opinion they may be with re&s;pect to terms of church communion.</P>
<P>And let us all remember, and never forget our future &s;olemn meeting on that great day of the Lord; the day of infallible deci&s;ion and of the everla&s;ting and unalter|able &s;entence. Amen.</P>
