<OPENER><SALUTE>My DEAR CHILDREN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>&sect;. 1. NOT knowing how long it may plea&s;e God to continue me among&s;t you, I am willing to embrace this Opportunity of leaving you my Advice and Coun&s;el, with re&s;pect to your <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> and civil Capacity and Duty in this World: And I both be&s;eech you and charge you, by the Relation you have to me, and the Affection I have always &s;hewn to you, and indeed receiv'd from you, that you lay up the &s;ame in your Hearts, as well as your Heads, with a wi&s;e and religious Care.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="043124_0003_101CD162C7945E60">
&sect;. 2. I will begin with that which is the Beginning of all true Wi&s;dom and Happine&s;s, the <HI>holy Fear of God.</HI></P>
<P>Children, Fear God; that is to &s;ay, Have an holy Awe upon your Minds to avoid that which is evil, and a &s;trict Care to embrace and do that which is good. The Mea&s;ure and Standard of which Knowledge and Duty, is the Light of Chri&s;t in your Con&s;ciences, by which, as in <HI>John</HI> iii. 20, 21. you may clearly &s;ee if your Deeds, ay, and your Words and Thoughts too, are wrought in God or not; for they are the Deeds of the Mind, and for which you mu&s;t be judged; I &s;ay, with this divine Light of Chri&s;t in our Con&s;ciences, you may bring your Thoughts, Words, and Works to Judgment in your&s;elves, and have a right true, &s;ound and unerring Sen&s;e of your Duty towards God and Man. And as you come to obey this ble&s;&s;ed Light in its holy Convictions, it will lead you out of the World's dark and degenerate Ways and Works, and bring you unto Chri&s;t's Way and Life, and to be of the Number of his true &s;elf-denying Followers, to take up your Cro&s;s for his Sake, that bore his for yours; and to become the Children of the Light, putting it on, as your holy Armour; by which you may &s;ee and re&s;i&s;t the fiery Darts of Satan's Temptations, and overcome him in all his A&s;&s;aults.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="043124_0004_101CD1AB4CC758D8">
&sect;. 3. I would a little explain this Principle to you. It is call'd <HI>Light,</HI> John i. 9. iii. 19, 20, 21. and viii. 12. <HI>Ephe&s;.</HI> v. 8. 13, 14 1 <HI>The&s;&s;.</HI> v. 5. 1 Epi&s;tle of <HI>John</HI> i. 5, 6, 7. <HI>Rev.</HI> xxi. 23. becau&s;e it gives Man a Sight of his Sin. And 'tis al&s;o called the <HI>quickening Spirit;</HI> for &s;o he is called; and the <HI>Lord from Heaven,</HI> as 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xv. 45, 57. who is call'd and calls him|&s;elf the <HI>Light of the World,</HI> John viii. 12. And why is he called <HI>the Spirit?</HI> Becau&s;e he give Man &s;piritual Life. And, <HI>John</HI> xvi. 8. Chri&s;t promi&s;ed to &s;end his Spirit <HI>to convince the World of their Sins:</HI> Wherefore, that which con|vinces you and all People of their Sins, is the Spirit of Chri&s;t: This is highly prized, <HI>Rom.</HI> viii. as you may read in that great and &s;weet Chapter, for the Children of God <HI>are led by it.</HI> This reveals the Things of God, that appertain to Man's Salvation and Happine&s;s, as 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> ii. 10, 11, 12. It is the Earne&s;t God gives his People, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> v. 5. It is the great End and Benefit, and Ble&s;&s;ing, of the Coming of Chri&s;t, <HI>viz.</HI> The &s;hining forth of this Light, and pouring forth of this Spirit. Yea, Chri&s;t is not received by them that re&s;i&s;t his Light, and Spirit in their Hearts&punc; nor can they have the Benefit of his Birth, Life, Death, Re&s;urrection, Interce&s;&s;ion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who rebel again&s;t the Light. God &s;ent his Son to ble&s;s us, in turning of us from the Evil of our Ways: Therefore have a care of Evil, for that turns you away from God; and wherein you have done Evil, do &s;o
<PB N="6" REF="043124_0005_101CD16473927808">
no more: But be ye turned, my dear Children, from that Evil in Thought, as well as in Word or Deed, or that will turn you from God your Creator, and Chri&s;t whom he has given you for your Redeemer; who redeems and &s;aves his People <HI>from their Sins,</HI> Tit. ii. 14. not in their Sins; read <HI>Acts</HI> ii. and <HI>Heb.</HI> viii. And the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Di&s;pen&s;ation will appear to be that of the Spirit, which Sin quencheth, hardens the Heart again&s;t, and bolts the Door upon. This holy divine Principle is called <HI>Grace</HI> too, <HI>Tit,</HI> ii. 11, 12. there you will &s;ee the Nature and Office of it, and its ble&s;&s;ed effects upon tho&s;e that were taught of it in the primitive Days. And why <HI>Grace?</HI> Becau&s;e it is God's Love, and not our De&s;ert, his Good-will, his Kind|ne&s;s. <HI>He &s;o loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son into the World, that who&s;oever believeth in him &s;hould not peri&s;h, but have ever|la&s;ting Life,</HI> John iii. 6. And it is this holy Son, that in <HI>John</HI> i. 14. 16. is declared to be <HI>full of Grace and Truth,</HI> and that of his Grace we <HI>receive Grace for Grace;</HI> that is we receive of him, the Fulne&s;s, what Mea&s;ure of Grace we need. And the Lord told <HI>Paul</HI> in his great Trials, when ready to &s;tagger about the Suffi|ciency of the Grace he had receiv'd to deliver him, <HI>My Grace is &s;ufficient for thee,</HI> 2 Cor. xii. 9. O Children! love the Grace, hearken to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> Grace, it will teach you, it will &s;anctify you, it will lead you to the Re&s;t and Kingdom o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> God; as it taught the Saints of old, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> who

to deny, viz. <HI>To deny Ungodline&s;s and worldy Lu&s;ts;</HI> and then what to do, viz. <HI>To live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly, and godly in this pre&s;ent World,</HI> Tit. ii. 11. 12. And he that is full of Grace, is full of Light, and he that is full of Light is the quickning Spirit, that gives <HI>a Manife&s;tation of his Spirit to every one to profit with,</HI> 1 Cor. xii. 7. And he that is the quick|ning Spirit is the Truth. <HI>I am the Way, the Truth and the Life,</HI> &s;aid he to his poor Fol|lowers, <HI>John</HI> xiv. 6. And <HI>if the Truth make you free,</HI> &s;aid he to the <HI>Jews, then are you free indeed,</HI> John viii. 32. 30. And this Truth &s;heds abroad it&s;elf in Man, and begets Truth in the inward Parts, and makes fal&s;e, rebellious, hypocritical Man, a true Man to God again. Truth in the inward Parts is of great Price with the Lord. And why called TRUTH? Becau&s;e it tells Man the Truth of his &s;piritual State; it &s;hews him his State, deals plainly with him, and &s;ets his Sins in Order before him. So that, my dear Children, the <HI>Light, Spirit, Grace,</HI> and <HI>Truth,</HI> are not divers Prin|ciples, but divers Words or Denominations given to one eternal Power and heavenly Prin|ciple in you, though not of you, but of God, according to the Manife&s;tation or Operation thereof in the Servants of God of old Time: <HI>Light,</HI> to di&s;cover and give Di&s;cerning; <HI>Spirit,</HI> to quicken and enliven: <HI>Grace,</HI> to wit, <HI>the Love of God: Truth,</HI> becau&s;e it tells Man the Truth of his Condition, and redeems him from
<PB N="8" REF="043124_0007_101CD169DB12EC68">
the Errors of his Ways; that as Darkne&s;s, Death, Sin, and Error, are the &s;ame, &s;o <HI>Light, Spirit, Grace</HI> and <HI>Truth,</HI> are the &s;ame.</P>
<P>&sect;. 4. This is that which is come by Chri&s;t; and a Mea&s;ure of this Light, Spirit, Grace, and Truth, is given to every Man and Woman to &s;ee their Way to go by. This is that which di&s;tingui&s;hes FRIENDS from all other Societies, as they are found walking in the &s;ame, which leads out of vain Honours, Compliments, Lu&s;ts and Plea&s;ures of the World.</P>
<P>O my dear Children! this is the Pearl of Price; part with all for it, but never part with it for all the World. This is the Go&s;pel Leaven to leaven you&punc; that is, &s;anctify and &s;ea&s;on you in Body, Soul and Spirit, to God your heavenly Father's U&s;e and Service, and your own la&s;ting Comfort. Yea, this is the divine and incor|ruptible Seed of the Kingdom, of which, all truly regenerate Men and Women, <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> of Chri&s;t's making, are born. Receive it into your Hearts, give it Room there, let it take deep Root in you, and you will be fruitful unto God, in every good Word and Work. As you take heed to it, and the holy Enlight|enings and Motions of it, you will have a perfect Di&s;cerning of the Spirit of this World; in all its Appearances in your&s;elves and others; the Motions, Temptations and Workings of it, as to Pride, Vanity, Covetou&s;ne&s;s, Revenge,
<PB N="9" REF="043124_0008_101CD1B0B05A8270">
Uncleanne&s;s, Hypocri&s;y, and every evil Way; you will &s;ee the World in all its Shapes and Features, and you will be able to judge the World by it, and the Spirit of the World in all its Appearances: You will &s;ee, as I have done, that there is much to deny, much to &s;uffer, and much to do: And you will &s;ee, that there is no Power or Virtue but in the Light, Spirit, Grace and Truth of Chri&s;t, to carry you through the World to God's Glory and your everla&s;ting Peace. Yea, you will &s;ee what Religion is from above, and what is from below; what is of God's working, and of Man's making and forcing; al&s;o, what Mini|&s;try is of his Spirit and giving, and what of Man's &s;tudying, framing, and impo&s;ing. You will, I &s;ay, di&s;cern the Ri&s;e, Nature, Tokens, and Fruits of the true from the fal&s;e Mini&s;try, and what Wor&s;hip is &s;piritual, and what ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nal; and what Honour is of God, and what that Honour is, which is from below of Men, yea, fallen Men, that the <HI>Jews</HI> and the World &s;o generally love and which is &s;poken again&s;t in <HI>John</HI> v. 44. you will &s;ee the vain and evil Communication, that corrupts good Manners; the Snares of much Company and Bu&s;ine&s;s, and e&s;pecially the Danger of the Friend&s;hip of this pre&s;ent evil World. And you will al&s;o &s;ee, that the Te&s;timony the eternal God hath brought our poor Friends unto, as to <HI>Religion, Wor&s;hip, Truth-&s;peaking, Mini&s;try, Plainne&s;s, Simplicity,</HI> and <HI>Moderation</HI> in <HI>Apparel, Furni|ture,

Food, Salutation:</HI> as you may read in their Writings, from the very Beginning, is a true and heavenly Te&s;timony of his Mind, Will, Work and Di&s;pen&s;ation in this la&s;t Age of the World to Mankind, being the Revival of true primitive <HI>Chri&s;tianity:</HI> Where, your mo&s;t tender Father prays, that you may be kept, and charges you to watch, that you may be pre&s;erved in the Faith and Practice of that ble&s;&s;ed Te&s;timony; and count it no &s;mall Mercy from God, nor Honour to you, that you come of Parents that counted nothing too dear or near to part with, nor too great to do or &s;uffer, that they might approve them&s;elves to God, and te&s;tify their Love to his mo&s;t precious Truth in the inward Parts, in their Generation. And I do al&s;o charge you, my dear Children, to retain in your Remembrance tho&s;e worthy Ancients in the Work of Chri&s;t, who remained alive to your Day and Memory, and yet remain to your Knowledge; more e&s;pecially that Man of God and Prince in <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> the fir&s;t-born and begotten of our Day and Age of Truth, and the fir&s;t and the great early In&s;trument of God among&s;t us, GEORGE FOX.

<PB N="11" REF="043124_0010_101CD1B236FA5358">
thereof, as an holy, exemplary, and edifying Tradition unto them. And be &s;ure, that you for&s;ake not the A&s;&s;embling your&s;elves with God's People, as the Manner of &s;ome was, <HI>Heb.</HI> x. 25. and is at this Day, e&s;pecially among young People, the Children of &s;ome Friends, whom the Love of this pre&s;ent evil World hath hurt and cooled in their Love to God and his Truth. But do you keep clo&s;e to Meetings, both of Wor&s;hip, and Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Church, when of and Age and Capacity proper for it; and that not out of Novelty, Formality, or to be &s;een of Men, but in pure Fear, Love and Con&s;cience to God you Cre|ator, as the publick, ju&s;t and avowed Te&s;ti|mony of your Duty and Homage to Him: In which be exemplary, both by timely coming, and a reverent and &s;erious Deportment during the A&s;&s;embly; in which be not weary, or think the Time long till it be over, as &s;ome did of the <HI>Sabbaths</HI> of old Time; but let your Eye be to him you come to wait upon and &s;erve, and do what you do as to him, and he will be your Refre&s;hment and Reward; for you &s;hall return with the Seals and Pledges of his Love, Mercy and Ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>&sect;. 5. Above all things, my dear Children, as to your communion and Fellow&s;hip with Friends, be careful to keep the Unity of the Faith in the Bond of Peace. Have a Care of Reflectors, Detractors, Backbiters, that under|value

and undermine Brethren behind their Backs, or &s;light the good and whol&s;ome Order of Truth, for the pre&s;erving Things quiet, &s;weet and honourable in the Church. Have a Care of Novelties, and airy changeable People, the conceited, cen&s;orious and puft up; who at la&s;t have always &s;hewn them&s;elves to be Clouds without Rain, and Wells without Water, that will rather di&s;turb and break the Peace and Fellow&s;hip of the Church, where they dwell, than not have their Wills and Ways take place. I charge you, in the Fear of the living God, that you carefully beware of all &s;uch; mark them, as the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>Rom.</HI> xvi. 17. and have no Fellow&s;hip with them; but to advi&s;e, exhort, intreat, and finally reprove them, <HI>Ephes.</HI> v. 11. For God is and will be with his People, in this holy Di&s;pen&s;ation we are now under, and which is now among&s;t us, unto the End of Days: It &s;hall grow and increa&s;e in Gifts, Graces, Power and Lu&s;tre, for it is the la&s;t and unchangeable One: And ble&s;&s;ed are your Eyes, if they &s;ee it, and your Ears, if they hear it, and your Hearts, if they under&s;tand it; which I pray that you may, to God's Glory and your eternal Comfort.</P>
<P>&sect;. 6. Having thus expre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to you, my dear Children, as to the Things of God, his Truth and Kingdom, I refer you to his Light&punc; Grace, Spirit and Truth within you, and the holy Scriptures of Truth without you,

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>&sect;. 1. I WILL begin here al&s;o with the Beginning of Time, the Morning. So &s;oon as you wake, retire your Mind into a pure Silence from all Thoughts and Ideas of worldly Things, and in that Frame wait upon God, to feel his good Pre&s;ence to lift up your Hearts to him, and commit your whole Self into his ble&s;&s;ed Care and Protection. Then ri&s;e, if well, immediately; being dre&s;t, read a Chapter or more in the Scriptures, and after|wards di&s;po&s;e your&s;elves for the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Day; ever remembring that God is pre&s;ent, the Over&s;eer of all your Thoughts, Words and Actions; and demean your&s;elves, my dear Children, accordingly; and do not you dare to do that in his holy all-&s;eeing Pre&s;ence, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> a Man, yea, a Child, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> do. And as you have Intervals from your lawful Occa&s;ions, delight to &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">p home, within your&s;elves I mean, and com|mune with your own Hearts, and be &s;till; and, as <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> &s;aid on another Occa|&s;ion, <HI>One like the Son of God you &s;hall find and

enjoy with you and in you;</HI> a Trea&s;ure the World knows not of, but is the Aim, End and Diadem of the Children of God. This will bear you up again&s;t all Temptations, and carry you &s;weetly and evenly through your Day's Bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;upporting you under Di&s;ap|pointments, and moderating your Satisfaction in Succe&s;s and Pro&s;perity. The Evening come, read again the holy Scripture, and have your Times of Retirement, before you clo&s;e your Eyes, as in the Morning; that &s;o the Lord may be the <HI>Alpha</HI> and <HI>Omega</HI> of every Day of your Lives. And if God ble&s;s you with Families, remember good <HI>Jo&s;hua's</HI> Re&s;olution, <HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> xxiv. 15. <HI>But as for me and my Hou&s;e, we will &s;erve the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. 2. Fear God; &s;hew it in De&s;ire, Refrain|ing and Doing: Keep the inward Watch, keep a clear Soul and a light Heart. Mind an inward Sen&s;e upon doing any Thing; when you read the Scripture, remark the notable&s;t Places, as your Spirits are mo&s;t toucht and affected, in a common-place Book, with that Sen&s;e or Opening which you receive; for they come not by Study or in the Will of Man, no more than the Scripture did; and they may be lo&s;t by Carele&s;ne&s;s, and over-growing Thoughts and Bu&s;ine&s;&s;es of this Life; &s;o in pur&s;uing any other good or Profitable Book; yet rather meditate than read much. For the Spirit of a Man knows the Things of a Man,
<PB N="16" REF="043124_0015_101CD175D04B2098">
and with that Spirit, by Ob&s;ervation of the Tempers and Actions of Men you &s;ee in the World, and looking into your own Spirits, and meditating thereupon, you will have a deep and &s;trong Judgment of Men and Things. For from what may be, what &s;hould be, and what is mo&s;t probable or likely to be, you can hardly mi&s;s in your Judgment of human Affairs; and you have a better Spirit than your own, in re&s;erve for a Time of Need, to pa&s;s the final Judgment in important Matters.</P>
<P>&sect;. 3. In Conver&s;ation, mark well what others &s;ay or do, and hide your own Mind, at lea&s;t till la&s;t; and then open it as &s;paringly as the Matter will let you. A ju&s;t Ob&s;ervance and Reflection upon Men and Things, give Wi&s;dom; tho&s;e are the great <HI>Books</HI> of <HI>Learning</HI> &s;eldom read. The laborious Bee draws Honey from every Flower. Be always on your Watch, but chiefly in Company; then be &s;ure to have your Wits about you, and your Armour on; &s;peak la&s;t and little, but to the Point. Interrupt none, anticipate none, read <HI>Prov.</HI> x. 8. 13. <HI>Be quick to hear &s;low to &s;peak,</HI> Prov. xvii. 27. <HI>It gives Time to under&s;tand, and ripens an An&s;wer.</HI> Affect not Words, but Matter, and chiefly to be pertinent and plain: True&s;t Eloquence is plaine&s;t, and brief Speaking, I mean Brevity and Clearne&s;s to make your&s;elves ea&s;ily under|&s;tood by every Body, and in as few Words as the Matter will admit of, is the be&s;t.</P>

Secondly,</HI> he was humble in his <HI>Life:</HI> He kept no Court but in De&s;erts and Mountains, and in &s;olitary Places; neither was he &s;erv'd in State, his Attendants being of the mechanick Size. By the Miracles he wrought, we may under&s;tand the Food he eat, <HI>viz.</HI> Barley-bread and Fi&s;h; and it is not to be thought there was any Curio&s;ity in dre&s;&s;ing them. And we have Rea&s;on to believe his Apparel was as moderate as his Table. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> he was humble in his <HI>Sufferings</HI> and <HI>Death:</HI> He took all Affronts patiently, and in our Nature triumph|ed over Revenge: He was de&s;pi&s;ed, &s;pit upon, buffetted, whipt, and finally crucified between Thieves, as the greate&s;t Malefactor; yet he never reviled them, but an&s;wered all in Silence and Submi&s;&s;ion, pitying, loving, and dying for tho&s;e by whom he was ignominiou&s;ly put to Death.

by it.

And as he was, we &s;hould be, in this World, ac|cording to the beloved Di&s;ciple, 1 <HI>John</HI> ii. 6. So what he did for us, was not to excu&s;e but excite our Humility. For as he is like God, we mu&s;t be like him; and that the Froward, the Contentious, the Revengeful, the Striker, the Dueller, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> cannot be &s;aid to be of that Number, is very evident.

He did not only not make him&s;elf, but is born the nakede&s;t and mo&s;t helple&s;s of almo&s;t all Creatures. Nor can he add to his Days; or Stature, or &s;o much as make one Hair of his Head white or black. He is &s;o ab&s;olutely in the Power of another, that, as I have often &s;aid, he is at be&s;t but a

<P>Wherefore avoid <HI>Pride</HI> as you would avoid the Devil; remembring you mu&s;t die, and con&s;equently tho&s;e Things mu&s;t die with you that could be any Temptation to Pride; and that there is a Judgment follows, at which you mu&s;t give an Account, both for what you have enjoy'd and done.</P>

<P>&sect;. 8. <HI>Integrity</HI> is a great and commendable Virtue. A Man of Integrity, is a true Man, a bold Man, and a &s;teady Man; he is to be tru&s;ted and relied upon. No Bribes can cor|rupt him, no Fear daunt him; his <HI>Word is &s;low in coming, but &s;ure.</HI> He &s;hines brighte&s;t in the Fire, and his Friend hears of him mo&s;t when he mo&s;t needs him. His Courage grows with Danger, and conquers Oppo&s;ition by Con&s;tancy. As he cannot be flatter'd or frighted into that he di&s;likes, &s;o he hates Flat|tery and Temporizing in others. He runs with Truth, and not with the Times; with Right, and not with Might. His Rule is &s;trait; <HI>&s;oon &s;een but &s;eldom followed:</HI> It has done great

It was Integrity prefer'd <HI>Abel's</HI> Offer|ing, tran&s;lated <HI>Enoch,</HI> &s;aved <HI>Noah,</HI> rai&s;ed <HI>Abra|ham</HI> to be God's Friend, and Father of a great Nation, re&s;cued <HI>Lot</HI> out of <HI>Sodom,</HI> ble&s;&s;ed and encrea&s;ed <HI>Jacob,</HI> kept and exalted <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> up|held and re&s;tor'd <HI>Job,</HI> honour'd <HI>Samuel</HI> before <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> crowned <HI>David</HI> over all Difficulties, and gave <HI>Solomon</HI> Peace and Glory, while he kept it; it was this pre&s;erv'd <HI>Mordecai</HI> and his People, and &s;ignally defended <HI>Daniel</HI> among the Lions, and the Children in the Flames, that it drew from the greate&s;t King upon Earth, and an <HI>Heathen</HI> too, a mo&s;t pathetical Confe&s;&s;ion to the <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Wi&s;dom of the God that &s;aved them, and which they &s;erved.</HI> Thus is the Scripture fulfilled, <HI>The Integrity of the Upright &s;hall Guide them,</HI> Prov. xi. 3.

<P>&sect;. 9. <HI>Gratitude</HI> or <HI>Thankfulne&s;s,</HI> is another Virtue of great Lu&s;tre, and &s;o e&s;teemed with God and all good Men: It is an owning of Benefits receiv'd to their Honour and Service that confer them. It is indeed a noble &s;ort of Ju&s;tice, and might, in a Sen&s;e, be refer'd as a Branch to that Head; with this Difference, though, that &s;ince Benefits exceed Ju&s;tice, the Tye is greater to be grateful, than to be ju&s;t; and con&s;equently there is &s;ometing ba&s;er and
<PB N="49" REF="043124_0048_101CD1E5A3A5AFC8">
more reproachful in Ingratitude than Inju&s;tice. So that, though you are not obliged by legal Bonds or Judgments, to Re&s;titution with due Intere&s;t, your Virtue, Honour and Humanity, are naturally Pledges for your Thankfulne&s;s; and by how much the le&s;s you are under external Ties, e&s;teem your inward Ties &s;o much the &s;tronger. Tho&s;e that can break them, would know no Bounds: For, make it a Rule to you, <HI>the Ungrateful would be unju&s;t too, but for fear of the Law.</HI> Always own therefore the Benefits you receive, and then to chu&s;e, when they may mo&s;t honour or &s;erve tho&s;e that conferred them. Some have lived to need the Favours they have done; and &s;hould they be put to <HI>a&s;k,</HI> where they ought to be <HI>invited?</HI> No matter if they have nothing to &s;hew for it, they &s;hew enough when they &s;hew them&s;elves to tho&s;e they have obliged: And &s;uch &s;ee enough to induce their Gratitude, when they &s;ee their Benefactors in <HI>Adver&s;ity;</HI> the le&s;s Law, the more Grace and the &s;tronger Tye. It is an <HI>Evangelical Virtue,</HI> and works, as <HI>Faith</HI> does, only by <HI>Love:</HI> In this it exactly re&s;embles a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> State; <HI>we are not under the Law, but under Grace,</HI> and it's by Grace, and not by Merit, <HI>that we are &s;aved.</HI> But are our Obligations the le&s;s to God, that he heaps his Favours &s;o unde&s;ervedly upon us! Surely no. It is the like here; <HI>that which we re|ceive is not owed or compelled,</HI> but <HI>freely given;</HI> &s;o no Tye, but Choice, a <HI>voluntary Goodne&s;s</HI>

without Bargain or Condition; but, has this therefore no Security? Yes certainly, the greate&s;t; a <HI>Judgment-Writ,</HI> and <HI>acknowledged in the Mind;</HI> he is his to the <HI>Altar with a good Con&s;cience:</HI> But how long? As long as he lives. The Characters of Gratitude, like tho&s;e of Friend&s;hip, are only defaced by Death, el&s;e indelible. <HI>A Friend that loveth at all Times,</HI> &s;ays <HI>Solomon,</HI> Prov. xvii. 17. xxvii. 10. And <HI>thine own Friend, and thy Father's Friend, for&s;ake not.</HI> It is Inju&s;tice which makes <HI>Gratitude</HI> a <HI>Precept.</HI> There are three Sorts of Men that can hardly be grateful; the <HI>fearful Man,</HI> for in Danger he lo&s;es his Heart, with which he &s;hould help his Friend: The <HI>proud Man,</HI> for he takes that Virtue for a Reproach: He that unwillingly remembers he owes any Thing to God, will not readily remember he is beholden to Man. <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> lays it to the Charge of &s;ome, of this Sort of great Men, that unea&s;y to &s;ee the Authors of their Greatne&s;s, have not been quiet till they have accompli&s;hed the Ruin of tho&s;e that rai&s;ed them. La&s;tly, the <HI>covetous Man</HI> is as ill at it as the other two; his Gold has &s;poiled his Memory, and won't let him dare be grateful, though perhaps he owes the be&s;t Part, at lea&s;t the Beginning of it, to another's Favour. As there is nothing more unworthy in a Man, &s;o nothing in Man &s;o frequently reproached in Scripture. How often does God put the <HI>Jews</HI> in Mind for their <HI>For|getfulne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Unthankfulne&s;s</HI> for the Mercies

<P>&sect;. 10. <HI>Diligence</HI> is another Virtue u&s;eful and laudable among Men: It is a di&s;creet and under&s;tanding Application of one's Self to Bu&s;ine&s;s; and avoids the Extreams of Idlene&s;s and Drudgery. It gives great Advantages to Men: It lo&s;es no Time, it conquers Difficul|ties, recovers Di&s;appointments, gives Di&s;patch, &s;upplies Want of Parts; and is that to them, which a Pond is to a Spring; though it has no Water of it&s;elf, it will keep what it gets, and is never dry. Though that has the Heels, this has the Wind; and often wins the Prize. Nor does it only concern Handicrafts and bodily Affairs; the Mind is al&s;o engaged, and grows foul, ru&s;ty and di&s;temper'd without it. It belongs to you, throughout your whole Man; be no more &s;antering in your Minds than in your Bodies. And if you would have
<PB N="52" REF="043124_0051_101CD21323603E70">
the full Benefit of this Virtue, don't baulk it by a confu&s;ed Mind. Shun <HI>Diver&s;ions;</HI> think only of the pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s, till that be done. Be bu&s;y to purpo&s;e; for a bu&s;y Man, and a Man of Bu&s;ine&s;s, are two different Things. Lay your Matters right, and Diligence &s;uc|ceeds them, el&s;e Pains is lo&s;t. How laborious are &s;ome to no Purpo&s;e? Con&s;ider your End well, &s;uit your Means to it, and then diligently employ them, and you arrive where you would be, with God's Ble&s;&s;ing. <HI>Solomon</HI> prai&s;es Dili|gence very highly: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> it is the Way to Wealth: <HI>The diligent Hand makes rich,</HI> Prov. x. 4. <HI>The Soul of the Diligent &s;hall be made fat,</HI> Chap. xiii. 4. There is a Promi&s;e to it, and one of another Sort to the Sluggard, Chap. xxii. 21. <HI>Secondly,</HI> it prefers Men, Ver&s;e 29. <HI>See&s;t thou a Man diligent in his Bu&s;ine&s;s, he &s;hall &s;tand before Kings. Thirdly,</HI> it pre&s;erves an E&s;tate: <HI>Be thou diligent to know the State of thy Flocks, and look well to thy Herd; for Riches are not for ever,</HI> Chap. xxvii. 23, 24. There is no living upon the Principal, you mu&s;t be diligent to pre&s;erve what you have, whether it be Acqui&s;ition or Inheritance; el&s;e it will con&s;ume. In &s;hort, the wi&s;e Man advi&s;es, <HI>What&s;oever thy Hand finds to do, do it with thy Might,</HI> Eccl. ix. 10. As is mends a temporal State, no &s;piritual one can be got or kept without it. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;es it upon the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> Deut. iv. 9, and vi. 7.

<P>&sect;. 11. <HI>Frugality</HI> is a Virtue too, and not of little U&s;e in Life, the better Way to be rich, for it has le&s;s Toil and Temptation. It is pro|verbial, <HI>a Penny &s;av'd is a Penny got:</HI> It has a &s;ignificant Moral; for this Way of getting is more in your own Power, and le&s;s &s;ubject to Hazard, as well as Snares, free of Envy, void of Suits, and is before-hand with Calamities. For many get that cannot keep, and for want of Frugality &s;pend what they get, and &s;o come

If you can, lay up one Half of your Income for tho&s;e U&s;es, in which let Charity have at lea&s;t the &s;econd Con&s;ideration; but not <HI>Judas's,</HI> for that was in the wrong Place.</P>

Properly and &s;trictly &s;peak|ing, it refers to <HI>Diet;</HI> but, in general, may be con&s;ider'd as having Relation to all the Affec|tions and Practices of Men. I will therefore begin with it in regard to <HI>Food,</HI> the Sen&s;e in which it is cu&s;tomarily taken. <HI>Eat to live,</HI> and <HI>not live to eat,</HI> for that's below a Bea&s;t. Avoid Curio&s;ities and Provocations; let your chiefe&s;t Sauce be a good Stomach, which Temperance will help to get you. You cannot be too plain in your Diet, &s;o you are clean; nor too &s;paring &s;o you have enough for Nature. For that which keeps the Body low, makes the Spirit clear, as Silence makes it &s;trong.

In &s;hort, the&s;e Intemperances are great Enemies to Health and to Po&s;terity; for they di&s;ea&s;e the Body, rob Children, and di&s;appoint Charity, and are of evil Example; very catch|ing, as well as pernicious Evils. Nor do they end there: They are &s;ucceeded by other Vices, which made the Apo&s;tle put them together in his Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Galatians,</HI> Chap. v. 20, 21.
