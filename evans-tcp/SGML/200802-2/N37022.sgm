By fire, flood, famine; by intemperance more in meats and drinks which on the earth &s;hall bring di&s;ea&s;es dire! And Doctors &s;till more terrible." Milton.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t acceptable &s;ervice we can render to God, is beneficience to man. There are three ways of benefitting our fellow-creatures; we may be u&s;eful to their &s;ouls by good in&s;truction and example; we may be helpful to their bodies by feeding the hungry, and cloathing the naked; we can aid them in their fortunes by encouraging indu&s;try, and pre&s;cribing ea&s;y remedies to the &s;ick; and in this we &s;hall relieve the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed;
<PB REF="048490_0003_10254c224fbd6b40">
which in a word is doing all the good we can to our fellow-creatures. The&s;e are the ways of improving our talents, which God has entru&s;ted us with; and we mu&s;t expect hereafter to give an account how we have employed them.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h it were in my power to &s;erve mankind more than I do, but alas! Vain wi&s;h: how often did I publi&s;h in the Virginia Gazatte in the time of the great di&s;tre&s;s of the Flux, (I believe in the year 1773) and two hundred and &s;ixty-four receipts I had printed, and gave out in the year 1774; from which in&s;tructions numbers have te&s;tified of the good received, both in being pre|&s;erved from catching, as well as well as being re&s;tored to perfect health, when beyond all hopes of recovery, which gave me great encouragement to write; but the troubles of the late war, and being in an un&s;ettled &s;ituation, has prevented one, though it&punc; has laid long and heavy on my mind: yet I have put it off till now, I pray God it may be accepted and ble&s;t of him, of which I make no doubt as he &s;o graciou&s;ly accepted the widows mite. I publi&s;h this treati&s;e to lead the poor in the plea&s;ant path of health, and when they have the misfortune to be &s;ick, to &s;hew them the cheape&s;t, ea&s;ie&s;t, &s;afe&s;t, and be&s;t way to get well again.</P>
<P>The lower part of our country are &s;ubject to more di&s;orders than the upland, there being &s;o many &s;wamps, mar&s;hes, bogs, and the over|flowing of fre&s;h water rivers, from which pro|ceeds fogs, a damp air, with loath&s;ome and bad &s;cents, from which proceed agues, and followed with long inward fevers, drop&s;ies, coughs, pleura&s;y, con&s;umptions, and with many others which the upland is not &s;o &s;ubject to; yet our upland is not exempt from all di&s;orders; for be|cau&s;e of &s;wearing, the Land mourneth, &s;ayeth
<PB REF="048490_0004_10254c26e6685620">
the good old prophet Jeremiah many hundred years ago: &s;o our upland is afflicted as well as the low, and with the rheumati&s;m, fluxes, can|cers, and with a di&s;mal train of other di&s;orders which make a &s;ad havock all over our &s;tates. Is it po&s;&s;ible to &s;ee the&s;e calamities rage without the tendere&s;t compa&s;&s;ion? Surely, what can be more melancholy than to have &s;o many poor people peri&s;h for want of u&s;ing timely means for their pre&s;ervation? They neglect to take any re|medy till their ca&s;e is grown de&s;perate, and death begins to &s;tare them in the face. They con&s;ider not that a moderate &s;kill may recover them in the begin|ning of a di&s;temper while he has &s;trength to go through all the nece&s;&s;ary operations, but when the whole college &s;hould not be able to &s;ave him after his &s;pirits are &s;unk, and all the principles of life are nearly extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>This unhappy di&s;temper occa&s;ions a great deal of mortality, and what makes the misfortune the greater, is, that it falls heavier on the younger &s;ort who are mo&s;t liable to harringing di&s;tempers. Indeed &s;ome would be glad of a&s;&s;i&s;tance if they did not think the remedy nearly as had as the di&s;order; for our doctors are &s;o exorbitant in their fees whether they kill or cure, that the patient had rather tru&s;t to his con&s;titution than run the ri&s;que of beggaring his family:</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations made me, count it a work of charity, and public &s;pirit to communicate to the&s;e exten&s;ive &s;tates, and particularly the poor the method of curing them&s;elves when they &s;hall fall into any of our common di&s;orders. For their great encouragement, the remedies I &s;hall pre|&s;cribe may be procured at little trouble and ex|pence, being for the mo&s;t part &s;uch as grow on their own plantations, or may be ea&s;ily procured.</P>
<P>Providence has been &s;o good as to furni&s;h al|mo&s;t

every country with medicines proper for the di&s;tempers incident to the climate, and &s;uch dome&s;tic remedies are always &s;ufficient for the cures of &s;uch di&s;orders, if a right u&s;e be made, with the ble&s;&s;ing of God. Their ca&s;es are &s;eldom compleated, but proceed for the mo&s;t part from cold, or &s;uch &s;light tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions in &s;uch ail|ments; the &s;ymptoms cannot ea&s;ily be mi&s;taken, nor is the cure difficult: all the &s;ecret lies in taking the di&s;temper in time, and this will be the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e mo&s;t di&s;orders that happen from cold, are exceedingly violent, and call aloud for &s;peedy a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Always remember, that the &s;ooner any di&s;order is taken in hand, the ea&s;ier the cure; becau&s;e nature is &s;trong and able to co-operate with the medicines they take&mdash;nor can we hope, that Heaven will a&s;&s;i&s;t us in our calamities unle&s;s we endeavour at the &s;ame time to a&s;&s;i&s;t our&s;elves.</P>
<P>In &s;etting down the following pre&s;criptions, I have been cautions of not talking like an Apo|thecary, that is, of u&s;ing hard words that per|haps neither my patient nor I my &s;elf under&s;tands, not have I taken them lightly upon tru&s;t, but I am able to recommend mo&s;t of them upon more than thirteen years experience; for the re&s;t I have creditable authority for. In the mean time, I hope none will object like Noeman, the Syrian, to the ea&s;ine&s;s of any of the&s;e remedies; but rather rejoice that any can have &s;o great a ble&s;|&s;ing, &s;o very cheap; and in truth people mu&s;t love difficulty extreemly well to &s;light health for being gained with little for my own body, being &s;ickly brought me ea&s;ily into a capacity to know that health was the greate&s;t of all earthly ble&s;&s;ings&punc; and truly he was never &s;ick that doth not believe it than fir&s;t I &s;tudied the human body, and &s;econdly, I con&s;idered that all medicines
<PB REF="048490_0006_10254c2c5de774e0">
were compounded of herbs, roots, barks, flower, and &s;eeds and this fir&s;t let me to work in &s;tudying the nature of &s;imples; mo&s;t of which I knew by &s;ight before. Then I con&s;ulted with my two brothers, Doctor Rea&s;on, and Doctor Experi|ence, and took a voy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ge to vi&s;it my mother Na|ture, by who&s;e advice, together with the help of Doctor Diligence, and the ble&s;&s;ing of the God. I at la&s;t gained my de&s;ire, and being warned by Mr. Hone&s;ty, a &s;tranger in the pre&s;ent days, to pub|li&s;h it to the world, I have done it.</P>
<P>But, you will &s;ay, what need had I to have wrote on this &s;ubject when &s;o many famous and learned men have wrote &s;o much already. To this I an&s;wer of a truth; much have been wrote, but in &s;o high a &s;tyle, that the poor could not under&s;tand it; and I write for the poor, yet I make no doubt but the rich will be glad to make u&s;e of this treati&s;e for many of the di&s;orders that are herein mentioned, the Doctors call incura|ble; and be&s;ides, if the rich &s;end for the Doctor very time a child or a &s;ervant is &s;ick, it will take their whole income: and what then will pay their taxes, and cloath them? Secondly, before the Doctor could be got, perhaps the pa|tient might die, and if not he might &s;uffer greatly.</P>
<P>There are many parts that there is no Doctor to be got at all; now you &s;ee a rea&s;on for it: a rea&s;on it is &s;aid, makes a man differ from a bea&s;t, becau&s;e out of thy thoughts God &s;hould not pa&s;s his image &s;tamped, is on every weed and gra&s;s if you plea&s;e to make u&s;e of this little treati&s;e. I make no doubt but it will an&s;wer your de&s;ired effect; and then I am &s;ure you will not think your money thrown away, nor &s;pent in vain; but I hope you will give all the prai&s;e to God, which is the ardent wi&s;h of the public's friend and humble &s;ervant.</P>

<HEAD>TO TAKE FEVERS OUT OF WOMENS BREASTS.</HEAD>
<P>Take a large handful of herb truelove and boil it in two quarts of water till half is boiled away, then take out the herb, and put in the water a pound of fre&s;h butter that never was &s;alted, and then boil it till all the water is clean boiled out, then keep it for u&s;e, and if any woman's brea&s;t is inflamed, (called in common a fever) and if &s;he will anoint with this oil, it will immediately ea&s;e the pain, and take out the fever, and di&s;&s;olve the curdled milk; and if they be ulcerated, it will cure in a little time: yea, it will give ca&s;e in pain in all kinds of &s;wellings, and &s;catter the &s;welling to this herb. This is &s;o great a friend to nature that it may well be called truelove: it is a garden herb, and mu&s;t be &s;owed every year, and gathered when the under leaves begin to drop off. I know of none of this herb in all the&s;e &s;tates, not the feed, but what I have got, and one per&s;on more; which &s;eed I intend to have &s;owed, and give away; and I hope that every one, into who&s;e hands it may come, will do the like till it be &s;pread over the United States: yea, over the whole world. This is &s;o &s;weet an herb, that it will perfume the whole garden where it grows.</P>
