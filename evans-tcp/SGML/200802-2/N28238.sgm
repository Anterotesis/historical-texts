<Q><HI>BEHOLD! the LORD, the LORD of ho&s;ts, doth take away the mighty man, and the man of war</HI>&mdash;<HI>the prudent, and the ancient</HI>&mdash;<HI>the honourable man, and the coun|&s;ellor.</HI></Q>

<P>UNHAPPY the nation, de&s;tined to experi|ence &s;o great a calamity! Unhappy our na|tion; for &s;uch, alas, is its own de&s;tiny! The characters, drawn by the prophet, if di&s;tributed a|mong many members of a community, con&s;titute its glory and defence: but if, what rarely occurs, they are concentrated in ONE MAN, who can e&s;timate his importance? By his might, by his military &s;kill and bravery, by his prudence, by his age and experience, by the weight of his character, and by his coun&s;els; his influence toward the &s;ecurity and happine&s;s of a nation is incalculable. To be deprived, then, of &s;uch a man&mdash;how great the judgment! how affecting the calamity!</P>
<P>No event, le&s;s melancholy than this, could have cau&s;ed the &s;olemn &s;tillne&s;s, and the &s;orrowful a&s;pect, of this a&s;&s;embly. Yes: <HI>This day is this &s;cripture fulfilled in your ears:&mdash;for, behold!</HI> in the removal of

WASHINGTON, <HI>the</HI> LORD, <HI>the</HI> LORD <HI>of ho&s;ts, doth take away the mighty man, and the man of war&mdash;the prudent, and the ancient&mdash;the honourable man, and the coun&s;ellor.</HI></P>
<P>Will it be &s;uperfluous, on this affecting occa&s;ion, to exhibit the union of all the&s;e characters in the great and beloved Man, who&s;e lo&s;s we are now call|ed to deplore? New information, indeed, cannot be given you concerning him; for not a few of you have per&s;onally witne&s;&s;ed his talents and his virtues; and tho&s;e, who&s;e years admit not this te&s;timony, have been taught from the cradle to li&s;p his name, and to revere his character. Nor can the panegyric of the Preacher add aught to his tran&s;cendent fame. A &s;ummary review of his character, however, and of the &s;ervices which he has rendered to his country, is what Gratitude demands; and it may be happily conducive to our moral and religious improvement.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON was <HI>the mighty man.</HI> Lofty in &s;ta|ture, robu&s;t and vigorous in con&s;titution, he was formed for active enterpri&s;es, and heroic achieve|ments. At the pre&s;ent day, indeed, corporeal &s;trength and agility are far le&s;s material to the warrior, than they were in ancient times, when the battle was fought in per&s;onal combats, and when the chief wea|pons in u&s;e were the javelin and the &s;pear. They have always, however, their importance; nor, with|out them, could the American Hero have been uni|formly energetic for action, or have &s;u&s;tained the complicated cares, and oppre&s;&s;ive fatigues, of the camp.</P>

He, too, was <HI>the man of war.</HI> Endowed, by na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">re, with &s;ingular capacities for the formation of a mili|tary character, he became, by the aids of art and experience, a warrior of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction. At the early age of twenty two years, he &s;o highly &s;ignalized him&s;elf,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At Fort du Que&s;ne, in 1754; and at Braddock's defeat, 1755.</NOTE> at a very critical juncture, for his military &s;kill and bravery, as to excite great expectations of his future eminence; and it was, even then, pre|dicted,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">By the Rev. Mr. <HI>Davies,</HI> then in Virginia, afterwards Pre&s;i|dent of Princeton College.</NOTE> that he was rai&s;ed up to be the Saviour of his country. At length, the important cri&s;is arriv|ed, when the prediction received its accompli&s;hment. When, in the conte&s;t with the Parent State, it be|came nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>re&s;i&s;t unto blood;</HI> an army of citizen &s;oldiers &s;pontaneou&s;ly &s;prung into exi&s;tence, and ru&s;h|ed into the field, in defence of their invaded liber|ties. Collected, however, from the various colonies; diver&s;e in their habits and manners; unaccu&s;tomed to di&s;cipline; un&s;killed in war; and un&s;upplied with arms and ammunition; they compo&s;ed a body, which &s;eemed to promi&s;e nothing more propitious than early di&s;quietude, ob&s;tinate in&s;ubordination, fre|quent de&s;ertion, and &s;peedy di&s;&s;olution. At this in|tere&s;ting and hazardous moment, the eyes of the people were directed to GEORGE WASHINGTON, at Mount Vernon, in the di&s;tant colony of Virginia. No &s;ooner did he receive a commi&s;&s;ion from the American Congre&s;s, to take the command of the ar|my,

my than he exchanged his tranquil home for <HI>the con|fu&s;ed noi&s;e of the warrior,</HI> and for the perils and hard|&s;hips of the camp. Though he accepted his commi&s;|&s;ion with unaffected diffidence, he commenced its ex|ecution with the &s;teady zeal of enlightened patriot|i&s;m. Believing the American cau&s;e to be ju&s;t, he relied on the concurrent &s;upport of his fellow-citi|zens, and committed him&s;elf to the au&s;picious gui|dance and benediction of ALMIGHTY GOD.

defend the Capitol, and to &s;ave his own nation from &s;ervitude: not a Ce&s;ar, plotting to e&s;tablish his own power on the ruins of the Republic; but a Cato, ready to devote his fortune and his life to the &s;alva|tion of his country: not a Sylla, terminating his military career by the u&s;urpation of the civil author|ity; but a Cincinnatus, voluntarily relinqui&s;hing the &s;word for the plough, and retiring from the camp to the farm: not, in fine, a mere warrior, but a Man, blending the feelings of the citizen with tho&s;e of the &s;oldier, and tempering the ambition of the conqueror with the humility of the Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>Uniting quick perception with deep di&s;cernment, he formed and executed his own &s;chemes with pro|found judgment; while, with wonderful facility, he penetrated and defeated tho&s;e of his enemy. Fertile in re&s;ources, he was never at a lo&s;s for an expedient, in ca&s;es the mo&s;t critical, in junctures the mo&s;t haz|ardous. He was deliberate, without perplexity; calm, without apathy; animated, without enthu&s;i|a&s;m; deci&s;ive, without pertinacity; and bold, with|out temerity. Dignified in his per&s;on, he command|ed re&s;pect; amiable in his manners, he conciliated affection; &s;ucce&s;sful in his enterpri&s;es, he in&s;pired confidence. In camp, he maintained economy, with|out par&s;imony; order, without re&s;traint; and di&s;ci|pline, without &s;everity. In action, he was ardent, yet collected; intrepid, yet cautious; confident, yet unpre&s;uming.&mdash;By &s;o rare an a&s;&s;emblage of talents and virtues, he was admirably formed for the com|mand

of armies; and the &s;eries of his &s;ucce&s;&s;es, dur|ing a long and unequal conte&s;t, with the final tri|umph of the American arms, demon&s;trates, that, as <HI>the man of war,</HI> he is entitled to primary di&s;tinction in the annals of military fame.</P>
<P>He, al&s;o, combined in his character, the <HI>prudent, and the ancient.</HI> All his mea&s;ures were the re&s;ult of &s;erious thought, and deep reflection. Every avenue to danger &s;eemed di&s;clo&s;ed to his piercing eye; and no one of tho&s;e avenues was left unguarded.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Wa&s;hington's Letters.</NOTE> Vigi|lantly attentive to &s;eize an advantage, or to ward off an evil, he &s;ea&s;onably &s;ecured every attainable benefit, and cautiou&s;ly guarded again&s;t the &s;urpri&s;e of his enemy. Though never reluctant, when ju&s;tified by the occa&s;ion, to jeopard his own life and the lives of his brave &s;oldiers, on the high places of the field; yet, as became a prudent general, he &s;tudiou&s;ly &s;hun|ned unnece&s;&s;ary danger, and was more anxious for the &s;afety of his country, than ambitious for the hon|our of a victory. Like the Roman Fabius, he cho&s;e rather to exhau&s;t the enemy, by &s;tudied delays, than to put the liberties of a whole nation to the hazard of a &s;ingle battle. In the peculiar &s;ituation of our infant country, the <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> of WASHINGTON was <HI>bet|ter than weapons of war.</HI></P>
<P>When called to a political &s;tation, he di&s;covered the &s;ame prudence in the cabinet, for which he had &s;ignalized him&s;elf in the field. Ju&s;tly appreciating tho&s;e invaluable ble&s;&s;ings, which had been earned with blood, he watched over them with paternal vigilance,
<PB N="12" REF="037641_0010_100F29B88745E870">
and adopted the wi&s;e&s;t methods to in&s;ure their per|petuity. What ruler could have more prudently ex|erted his authority to prevent the evils of foreign influence, and of dome&s;tic faction; and to maintain inviolably the Peace and Independence of America?</P>
<P>Both in the civil and military departments, he de|rived great advantages from age and experience; for he was <HI>the ancient.</HI> Employed for nearly fifty years<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To the years of public &s;ervice, mentioned in his Valedictory Addre&s;s, it is incumbent on us to annex that portion of time, which, in the very evening of his days, he magnanimou&s;ly held pledged to the call of his country. Having been appointed, by the PRESIDENT, "Lieutenant General and Commander in Chief of all the armies rai&s;ed or to be rai&s;ed for the &s;ervice of the United States;" he accepted the appointment July 13, 1798, and retain|ed his commi&s;&s;ion till his death.</NOTE> in public offices; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, at the &s;ame time, a capacious mind; and habituated to an attentive ob|&s;ervation of men and things, of cau&s;es and effects; great were his improvements in u&s;eful knowledge, and eminent his qualifications for <HI>guiding the affairs</HI> of our infant Republic <HI>with di&s;cretion.</HI></P>
<P>He was, al&s;o, <HI>the honourable man.</HI> If the union of di&s;tingui&s;hed per&s;onal virtues with great military and political talents, and a long &s;eries of patriotic &s;ervices, entitle a man to honour; let honour be affixed to the name of WASHINGTON. Habituated to the gov|ernment of his appetites, he was exemplary for his temperance; and equally habituated to the govern|ment of his pa&s;&s;ions, he &s;et a noble example of equa|nimity. Accu&s;tomed to order and method, he did
<PB N="13" REF="037641_0011_100F29BA179AB980">
every thing by rule, without the pedantry of exact|ne&s;s; and, by his nice arrangements and preci&s;ion, he found time for the accompli&s;hment of every in|tere&s;ting purpo&s;e, however complex in its nature, however laborious in its execution. He united be|nevolence with ju&s;tice, and piety with morality.&mdash;Unlike the impious philo&s;ophi&s;ts of the pre&s;ent day, he aimed not to &s;eparate the duties which man owes to GOD, from tho&s;e which he owes to Society. He was not too wi&s;e, to be above the in&s;tructions of di|vine wi&s;dom; nor too uncon&s;cious of guilt, to de&s;|pi&s;e the redemption of the cro&s;s. He received the Holy Scriptures as the oracles of God; and treated with reverence the in&s;titutions of JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>But who will attempt a complete delineation of his many virtues? Like &s;tars, compo&s;ing a fair con|&s;tellation, they reflected a mild and &s;teady radiance, on which the eye delighted to dwell, and from which its &s;teadfa&s;t gaze could not, without regret, be averted.</P>
<P>Whatever were his virtues, whatever were his tal|ents, they were con&s;ecrated to God, and to his coun|try. His patrioti&s;m was too di&s;intere&s;ted, to admit impeachment, or &s;u&s;picion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is well known, that he refu&s;ed to receive any pecuniary compen&s;ation for his public &s;ervices.</NOTE> In relinqui&s;hing his calm and favourite abode, for the tempe&s;tuous &s;ea of public life, he uniformly &s;acrificed his per&s;onal ea&s;e and intere&s;t, comfort and tranquillity. What more was needful to give him the faire&s;t claim to the title of <HI>the honourable man?</HI>&mdash;Nor were his fellow-citizens
<PB N="14" REF="037641_0012_100F29BD9AF31028">
in&s;en&s;ible to his claims on their gratitude and prai&s;e. He was THE MAN <HI>whom</HI> they <HI>delighted to honour.</HI>&mdash;Greater proofs, than tho&s;e which they gave, of their ju&s;t e&s;timation of his merits and &s;ervices, could not have been exhibited. The deep and affecting in|tere&s;t, taken by all cla&s;&s;es of citizens in the melan|choly tidings of his death, does infinitely more hon|our to his name than the &s;toried urn, or the mon|umental marble.&mdash;"Illu&s;trious Man! deriving hon|our le&s;s from the &s;plendor of his &s;ituation, than from the dignity of his mind; before whom all borrowed greatne&s;s &s;inks into in&s;ignificance." So &s;aid an illu&s;|trious Member of the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charles J. Fox.</NOTE> when &s;peaking of our great and beloved WASHING|TON. Yes: His prai&s;es have re&s;ounded through the empire of Britain; they have been echoed through the world.</P>
<P>It need only be added, that he was <HI>the coun&s;ellor.</HI> In critical emergencies, he was often called to a&s;&s;i&s;t his fellow-countrymen with his coun&s;els, as well as by his arms. What reliance was placed on his judg|ment appears from the uniform deference paid to it, both in the cabinet and in the field. During the re|volutionary war, how greatly were the mea&s;ures of the American Congre&s;s influenced by his &s;ea&s;onable advices! When that war was clo&s;ed, and it became expedient to devi&s;e a new and improved form of government for the United States; we behold him placed in the pre&s;idential Chair of the National Con|vention,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In 1787.</NOTE> and e&s;&s;entially aiding, by his advice and in|fluence,
<PB N="15" REF="037641_0013_100F29C05E230EB0">
the formation of that admirable Con&s;titution, which is the grand palladium of our liberty.</P>
<P>Here, again, his coun&s;els and authority were deem|ed e&s;&s;ential to the union, to the intere&s;ts and happi|ne&s;s, of America. By the unanimous &s;uffrages of the people, he was invited to take a part in the ad|mini&s;tration of that government, which he had a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed to form; and &s;olicited to accept the Pre&s;idency of the United States. With his u&s;ual diffidence he ac|cepted the important tru&s;t. Twice four years did he continue to act in the Pre&s;idential office.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">He was elected Pre&s;ident in 1789; re-elected in 1793; and left the Pre&s;idency in 1797.</NOTE> How much, in that intere&s;ting period, he contributed, by his judicious and enlightened Admini&s;tration, to the peace, to the pro&s;perity, to the glory, of our Nation, the public Records will &s;hew, and a grateful People will carefully tran&s;mit to generations yet unborn.</P>
<P>While his fellow-citizens could perceive no dimi|nution of his corporeal or mental energies, the "in|crea&s;ing weight of years admoni&s;hing him to retire," and his love of rural and dome&s;tic retirement, height|ened by the contra&s;ted cares of public life, alluring him back to the &s;hades of Mount Vernon; he de|clined to be con&s;idered as a candidate for the future &s;uffrages of his countrymen. But he re&s;igns not his charge, before he has given the American People his la&s;t and be&s;t advice. Here <HI>the Coun&s;ellor</HI> appears in his greate&s;t glory. The <HI>Addre&s;s,</HI> which he delivered on this occa&s;ion, contains the re&s;ult of much ob&s;erva|tion,
<PB N="16" REF="037641_0014_100F29C1EC74B8D8">
and deep experience; and admirably points out the true intere&s;ts of United America. It is the Ad|dre&s;s of a father to his children, while deeply im|pre&s;&s;ed with an apprehen&s;ion of their dangers; and tenderly &s;olicitous to guide them to &s;ecurity and hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>America was loud in the applau&s;es of his Admini&s;|tration. His own remarks, on a retro&s;pective view of it, are worthy of a mind &s;uperior to the inflations of vanity; and they furni&s;h a model of humility and philanthropy, which it would be the glory of kings to re&s;emble: "Though in reviewing the incidents of my admini&s;tration I am uncon&s;cious of intentional error; I am, neverthele&s;s, too &s;en&s;ible of my defects, not to think it probable, that I have committed ma|ny errors. Whatever they may be, I fervently be|&s;eech the Almighty to avert or mitigate the evils to which they may tend. I &s;hall al&s;o carry with me the hope that my country will never cea&s;e to view them with indulgence; and that, after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its &s;ervice, with an up|right zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be con&s;igned to oblivion, as my&s;elf mu&s;t &s;oon be to the man&s;ions of re&s;t."</P>
<P>Words, alas, too prophetic! To tho&s;e man&s;ions, revered and beloved Man! art thou already con&s;ign|ed: <HI>For, behold! the Lord, the Lord of ho&s;ts, doth take away the mighty man, and the man of war&mdash;the prudent, and the ancient&mdash;the honourable man, and the coun&s;ellor&punc;</HI>

He changeth the countenance of the</HI> MAN GREATLY BELOVED, <HI>and &s;endeth him away.</HI> Strength and agility, military &s;kill and fortitude, pru|dence and penetration, avail him nothing. <HI>There is no wi&s;dom, nor under&s;tanding, nor coun&s;el, again&s;t the</HI> LORD. To his control the mo&s;t potent and formidable com|manders of armies are equally &s;ubjected with the com|mon &s;oldiery under their command. His orders are ab&s;olute, and mu&s;t be in&s;tantly and univer&s;ally obey|ed: for <HI>there is no di&s;charge in that war.&mdash;What man is he that liveth</HI>&mdash;whatever are his talents and his vir|tues, however he is endeared to Society, and how|ever
<PB N="18" REF="037641_0016_100F29C737ED90E0">
ever important his life and &s;ervices to the world&mdash;<HI>what man is he that liveth, and &s;hall not &s;ee death? &s;hall he deliver his &s;oul from the hand of the grave?</HI> No: let no man expect it; for WASHINGTON is dead.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON is dead! Here, then, let us unite in paying that tribute to his memory, which his eminent talents, virtues, and &s;ervices, demand. <HI>Know ye not that there is a prince and a great man &s;allen, this day, in I&s;rael?</HI> Yes: The&s;e &s;able hang|ings, that awful &s;ilence, tho&s;e tributary tears, te&s;tify that ye know too well the &s;ad event, which has over|whelmed our nation with unutterable &s;orrows. Well may ye, who have witne&s;&s;ed the military &s;kill, the patrioti&s;m, and the many virtues, of WASHINGTON, during his re&s;idence in this very place, unite, this day, to lament his fall. Well may ye, who once wor&s;hipped with him in this hou&s;e of prayer, pour forth your tears at the recollection of that exemplary piety, which &s;hone con&s;picuou&s;ly amid&s;t the confu|&s;ions of war, and the vices of the camp. Well may this Temple, which has often witne&s;&s;ed the &s;incerity and the &s;olemnity of his devotions, appear clothed in &s;ackcloth. What object around us can forbear to a&s;&s;ume a &s;ober &s;adne&s;s, and to participate in the uni|ver&s;al gloom? Ye circumjacent hills, that witne&s;&s;ed the mighty operations of this great Commander, who&s;e &s;ummits &s;till &s;hew the ve&s;tiges of war, and who&s;e &s;oil has been wet with the blood of our citi|zens! <HI>let there be no dew, neither let there be rain upon you.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="037641_0017_100F29C8CD0586D0">
Where, now, are tho&s;e veteran Generals, who, on yonder heights, accompanied <HI>the man of war,</HI> and aided him in the glorious conte&s;t? Come, mingle your tears with our's. Alas! Ye your&s;elves have departed. <HI>The Lord of ho&s;ts</HI> hath taken you away; and we have already wept over you. But do none of the&s;e mighty men, the&s;e hoary chiefs &s;urvive? Yes: LINCOLN, with a little band, remains. Brave and patriotic man! come, grey with years and with the toils of war, covered as thou art with wounds, and lead the funereal proce&s;&s;ion to the tomb of WASHINGTON. Ye war-worn Soldiers, who once fought under his banners! come, join the &s;olemn train, and pay the la&s;t military honours to the mem|ory of your much loved General. Ye venerable Sages! who co-operated in council, with his exer|tions in the field, for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of our Inde|pendence, come&mdash;Alas! ye too are gone. Illu&s;tri|ous ADAMS! thou live&s;t&mdash;live&s;t to weep over the remains of thy beloved Co-patriot, who was <HI>very plea&s;ant unto thee.</HI> Come, then, venerable Sire, and bring with thee the few remaining Fathers of our country, to pay this la&s;t &s;ad tribute.&mdash;Ye Daughters of America! come, <HI>weep over</HI> WASHINGTON, <HI>who clothed you in &s;carlet, with other delights, who put on or|naments of gold upon your apparel.&mdash;How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war peri&s;hed!</HI></P>
<P>But let not the deluge of our grief obliterate our gratitude to GOD, for rai&s;ing up &s;uch a Man to be the Saviour of his country. <HI>The</HI> LORD <HI>of ho&s;ts,</HI> who
<PB N="20" REF="037641_0018_100F29CAE894FE08">
hath now taken him away, originally formed him for the high purpo&s;e of our national &s;alvation. He endowed him with tho&s;e great talents, which quali|fied him to command in our armies, and to pre&s;ide in our councils, with &s;uch wi&s;dom and &s;kill, and with &s;uch admirable &s;ucce&s;s. <HI>The in&s;piration of the Almighty gave him under&s;tanding. The</HI> LORD <HI>of ho&s;ts</HI> him&s;elf <HI>taught his hands to war, and his fingers to fight. If it had not been the</HI> LORD <HI>who was on our &s;ide,</HI> vain had been his wi&s;dom, and impotent his &s;trength, <HI>The</HI> LORD <HI>of ho&s;ts was with him;</HI> therefore he was <HI>valiant in fight,</HI> prudent in council, and &s;ucce&s;sful in the defence of our liberties. With our tears, there|fore, let us intermingle our grateful acknowledg|ments to Almighty GOD, for &s;o rich and invaluable a ble&s;&s;ing. Let us prai&s;e his holy name, for protract|ing the life of this great and good Man, till our na|tional Liberty was completely vindicated, and our Peace and Independence effectually e&s;tabli&s;hed. <HI>Now, Lord, lette&s;t thou thy &s;ervant depart in peace; for his eyes have &s;een</HI> the <HI>&s;alvation</HI> of his country.</P>
<P>Humble, however, it becomes us to be, under the cha&s;ti&s;ement of Heaven. <HI>The &s;tay and the &s;taff,</HI> the pride and the glory, of our Nation are removed.&mdash;<HI>My father! my father! the chariot of I&s;rael, and the hor&s;emen thereof!</HI> In the death of One, who&s;e life was &s;o intere&s;ting to America, and to the world, and who&s;e fame re&s;ounded through both hemi&s;pheres, we &s;ee the in&s;ignificancy of human power, and the vani|ty of earthly greatne&s;s. <HI>The Lord of ho&s;ts hath pur|po&s;ed
<PB N="21" REF="037641_0019_100F29CCDB14E068">
it to &s;tain the pride of all glory.</HI> Let us <HI>hear the rod,</HI> and Him <HI>who hath appointed it.</HI> How &s;trikingly are we here admoni&s;hed to <HI>put not</HI> our <HI>tru&s;t in princes, nor in the &s;on of man, in whom is no help! for his breath goeth forth, he returneth to the earth; in that very day his thoughts peri&s;h.</HI> Such is the monitory u&s;e, which the prophet him&s;elf makes of the melancholy truth, this day illu&s;trated: <HI>Cea&s;e ye from man, who&s;e breath is in his no&s;trils; for wherein is he to be accounted of? For, behold! the Lord, the Lord of ho&s;ts doth take away the mighty man, and the man of war&mdash;the prudent, and the ancient&mdash;the honourable man, and the coun&s;ellor.</HI></P>
<P>Transferring, then, our confidence from mortal man to the living GOD, who is <HI>the &s;ame ye&s;terday, to|day, and forever,</HI> let us &s;eek from Him that aid, which He only can furni&s;h; and that &s;olace, which He only can be&s;tow. GOD <HI>is our refuge and &s;trength, a very pre&s;ent help in trouble.</HI> Guided by his coun&s;el, and protected by his power, we &s;hall &s;till dwell in perfect &s;afety. <HI>With Him is wi&s;dom and &s;trength, He hath coun|&s;el and under&s;tanding.</HI> He can always furni&s;h the in|&s;truments, and pro&s;per the means, of our national de|fence and happine&s;s. <HI>Sanctify,</HI> therefore, <HI>the</HI> LORD <HI>of ho&s;ts him&s;elf, and let Him be your fear, and let Him be your dread.&mdash;Tru&s;t in Him, at all times, ye people, pour out your hearts before Him.</HI></P>
<P>But, with your pious confidence in GOD, neglect not the means of &s;ecurity and pro&s;perity. <HI>Only fear the Lord, and &s;erve him in truth with all your heart: for con&s;ider how great things he hath done for you.</HI> Practi&s;e

<HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> which <HI>exalteth a nation.</HI> Follow the coun|&s;els, and obey the laws, of the excellent rulers, who <HI>proceed from our&s;elves,</HI> and who are the con&s;tituted <HI>min|i&s;ters of God</HI> to us <HI>for good.</HI> Under a mild and equita|ble admini&s;tration of government, <HI>lead quiet and peace|able lives, in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty.</HI>&mdash;But why does the Preacher offer his humble advice?

He de&s;igned, that, <HI>after his decea&s;e,</HI> we <HI>might be able to have it always in remembrance.</HI> His VALEDICTO|RY ADDRESS, then, let every one &s;tudy; its principles let every one adopt; its coun&s;els let every one re|gard; and we &s;hall yet be a happy people, <HI>&s;aved of the Lord,</HI> and <HI>made high among the nations in prai&s;e, and in name, and in honour.&mdash;Hear this, ye old men! and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land!
