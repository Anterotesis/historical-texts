<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>BUSINESS of importance requiring the pre&s;ence of Mon&s;ieur de St. Claire in the We&s;t-Indies, Madame, after his departure, propo&s;ed to retire with her little family to a &s;mall man&s;ion of their's in the moun|tainous parts of Switzerland. This lady, who was the be&s;t of mothers, re&s;olved not to revi&s;it Paris till her hu&s;band's re|turn:</P>
<P>To hearts affectionately attached to each other, a &s;eparation is always painful; and &s;uch was that a Mon&s;ieur and Mad|ame
<PB N="8" REF="036274_0006_1008690E47DE9A48">
de St. Claire, who &s;eemed to live but in each other's &s;ociety, and the dear circle that formed their dome&s;tic felicity.</P>
<P>The bu&s;ine&s;s which required this &s;epa|ration, could not, in all probability, be &s;ettled before the expiration of two years; an interval which this amiable parent had determined to devote to the education of her family; a ta&s;k &s;he would not have re&s;igned even to her deare&s;t friend, be|lieving the in&s;truction of her children to be a mother's <HI>fir&s;t</HI> duty.</P>
<P>Her's were lovely&mdash;but they were not without failings, and to the&s;e, a fooli&s;h fondne&s;s had never rendered her in&s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>The elde&s;t, a beautiful girl about twelve years of age; a boy, one year younger; and a ro&s;y &s;prightly darling of &s;even, were the whole of the "Little Family."</P>
<P>"I am &s;orry we are going to leave Paris," &s;aid Clara, as &s;he followed her mother to the carriage, "it is &s;o cheer|ful <HI>here;</HI> and in the country, where one fees no one, it will be very <HI>dull.</HI>" "It depends much upon our&s;elves," replied
<PB N="9" REF="036274_0007_1008690FC8D9BB58">
Madame de St. Claire, "whether we &s;hall find it &s;o. We are going to a &s;ituation beautiful by nature, and I have not an idea but its delightful &s;cenes will furni&s;h us with a &s;pecies of amu&s;ement, though very different, yet far more plea&s;ing and in|&s;tructive than any which the plea&s;ures of this gay city could afford." "I love the country," exclaimed Henry, "and have not the lea&s;t doubt of our being very com|fortable." "And I am &s;ure," cried Em|miline, "I &s;hall be happy wherever mam|ma is."</P>
<P>For three days, they proceeded on their journey without any interruption. Af|ter having travelled a few hours before &s;unri&s;e on the morning of the fourth, on pa&s;&s;ing &s;ome rugged ground, the wheel of the carriage &s;uddenly gave way. Fortu|nately they received no injury from the accident, which had happened in a place where no a&s;&s;i&s;tance could be procured. They were &s;ome miles di&s;tant from any town, and at a lo&s;s what cour&s;e to pur|&s;ue; when Henry, pointing with his fin|ger,
<PB N="10" REF="036274_0008_1008691215E364C0">
exclaimed, "Look, mamma, I think there mu&s;t be &s;ome hou&s;e near; is not that &s;moke I &s;ee between tho&s;e trees?" He was not mi&s;taken. It proceeded from the chimney of a cottage not very far di&s;|tant, whither they di&s;patched a &s;ervant, to know if it could afford them accom|modation, while the carriage was repair|ed. During his ab&s;ence, they &s;eated them&s;elves on a little hillock at the &s;ide of the road. The children amu&s;ed them|&s;elves with ob&s;ervations on every object that became vi&s;ible in the yet imperfect di&s;tance; till the ri&s;ing &s;un bur&s;ting with new &s;plendor on the di&s;tant mountains, and leaving the valleys beneath &s;till al|mo&s;t concealed in a&euml;rial &s;hade, attracted all their attentions: "Look, look, &s;i&s;ter, at the &s;un!" cried Henry, "we &s;hould not have &s;een &s;uch a glorious &s;ight at Pa|ris. Is it not charming, mamma? for the&s;e three mornings we have &s;een the &s;un ri&s;e." "It is, indeed, a &s;cene worthy all our admiration, nor ought we ever to contemplate it, but with hearts replete
<PB N="11" REF="036274_0009_10086915214C2B80">
with gratitude to the Almighty for the ble&s;&s;ings we daily receive. Let us never behold it, without thinking on Him who is the fountain of light, and &s;ource of ev|ery good!" Emmiline, who for &s;ome time had &s;ilently admired the glorious object, exclaimed, "But for what u&s;e did God make the &s;un?"</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MADAME.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your brother is able, I be|lieve, to an&s;wer this que&s;tion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HENRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have told me, mamma, that from the &s;un we derive light and heat, that without its influence we could neither have bread or fruits, for it is the &s;un that ripens all the productions of the earth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMMILINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank you, Henry. I &s;hall never &s;ee that glorious luminary, without returning thanks to the Almigh|ty for all the ble&s;&s;ings it procures us.</P>
</SP>
<P>The &s;ervant was by this time returned. "A poor place, my lady!" &s;aid the faith|ful Peter, half out of breath, "it is &s;carce|ly &s;ecure from wind and weather; I re|ally almo&s;t fear it will fall about your
<PB N="12" REF="036274_0010_100869176D2C0A88">
ears; and if a poor &s;ervant's advice be worth taking, I think we had better &s;eek a few hours ho&s;pitality el&s;ewhere." "Well, Peter!" interrupted his worthy mi&s;tre&s;s, "but what &s;ort of inhabitants did you meet with? Did they &s;ay we could remain there while the carriage is repaired?" "Alack, Madam, they have but &s;orry accommodations for them&s;elves. I &s;aw &s;omething like a &s;opha in one cor|ner, which, I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;erves occa&s;ionally for the poor old man to lie on when he is weary; but it is not fit for you, my good lady: Be this as it may, he &s;aid, you &s;hould be welcome to pa&s;s the night as well as the day there, if you would put up with what his hut afforded; that a few years back, he could have given you a better reception. While he &s;aid this, I ob&s;erved him bru&s;h off a tear that had fallen on his aged cheek. He has a good heart, I warrant him, and once knew bet|ter days." "Poor man!" replied Mad|ame de St. Claire, "let us accept his humble &s;helter." "Oh, dear mamma!"
<PB N="13" REF="036274_0011_10086918F4A5D050">
interrupted Clara, "do not go to that na&s;ty hovel!&mdash;From what Peter &s;ays, there is not a bed fit for us to lie on, &s;hould we be obliged to pa&s;s the night there; the roof may fall in upon us; and I dare to &s;ay, it is as dirty as a pig&s;tye; I would not go near it for the world; I &s;hould die with fright, I am &s;ure. We had better remain here, indeed we had."</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MADAME.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have you no thought but for your <HI>own</HI> &s;afety and convenience, Clara? (and for a moment the &s;erenity of her countenance was changed to di&s;|plea&s;ure) &s;orry am I to find you have de|rived &s;o little advantage from my for|mer advice. You &s;eem, at this in&s;tant, to forget you have a mother, a brother, or a &s;i&s;ter, and are only apprehen&s;ive of the danger which threatens your&s;elf. In|deed, this is no proof of the tenderne&s;s of your affection for us. That hovel, as you term it, may be the re&s;idence of &s;ome worthy though unfortunate fellow-creature, who&s;e hoary head, perhaps, has braved life's wintry &s;torm through many
<PB N="14" REF="036274_0012_1008691C0AC896F0">
anxious days of &s;ickne&s;s or of &s;orrow! It is but too probable, he is in need of the &s;upport it may be in our power to be&s;tow: Humanity, at lea&s;t, &s;hould induce us to make the inquiry; and &s;urely there is &s;ome &s;atisfaction in di&s;pen&s;ing comfort to the mi&s;erable. Could I any way re|lieve this aged &s;ufferer, (for &s;uch we are led to think him from Peter's account) I &s;hould feel more plea&s;ure, my child, as a gue&s;t beneath his humble roof, than mak|ing one in the mo&s;t &s;umptuous palace. If his little man&s;ion be not &s;o clean as we could wi&s;h it, our clothes can be wa&s;hed; and if they could not, you, who are &s;o di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed on the &s;ubject, have another frock to put on. For &s;hame, Clara, I thought you had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed le&s;s &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and pride.</P>
</SP>
<P>The unfeeling girl looked confu&s;ed, muttered &s;omething to her&s;elf, and re|luctantly followed the other children, who held each of them a hand of their dear mother.</P>
<P>"But if it &s;hould <HI>really</HI> be falling?" ex|claimed Henry, trembling with appre|hen&s;ion,
<PB N="15" REF="036274_0013_1008691E55199898">
"if it &s;hould fall on us!" "I think I may venture to a&s;&s;ert," replied Madame de St. Claire, "things are not quite &s;o bad as Peter has repre&s;ented them. Its pre&s;ent inhabitant has probably re&s;ided many years there; and were the cottage in &s;o &s;hattered a &s;tate as we have been in|formed, he would not have failed to men|tion his danger to the &s;ervant. Tho&s;e who&s;e fears will not permit them to ac|cept the a&s;ylum he offers us, may &s;tay here with Agnes, if &s;he al&s;o is afraid of approaching the de&s;olate dwelling; or remain alone." Agnes was a faithful at|tendant, who had lived from her infancy in this worthy family, and who&s;e mind was &s;uperior to tho&s;e emotions which now agitated tho&s;e of the young people. Henry's apprehen&s;ions were &s;oon over|come, <HI>fear</HI> was to him a &s;en&s;ation border|ing on cowardice; and he con&s;idered it as a weakne&s;s by which a well informed mind would feel it&s;elf degraded.</P>
<P>Agnes taking Emmiline's hand as &s;he was capering from &s;ide to &s;ide, exclaimed,
<PB N="16" REF="036274_0014_1008691FD7A74088">
"This my dear little girl feels no terror, I am &s;ure, at the thought of accompany|ing us!" "No, that I <HI>do not,</HI>" replied the charming prattler, "I long to &s;ee the old man: Peter, whom I have heard you &s;ay is a very good carpenter, can perhaps repair the hou&s;e, and I will help you and mamma to do any thing for him the mean while. Agnes! have you not one or two of tho&s;e little rolls you bought for us at the village, where we &s;lept la&s;t night? Give them to me, that I may &s;op them in &s;ome milk for him when we get there; he would reli&s;h them I dare to &s;ay, if, like the old woman, whom we &s;ome|times &s;ee on the <HI>pont neuf</HI> at Paris, he &s;hould have lo&s;t his teeth."</P>
<P>Fortunately, Agnes had remembered to remove from the carriage all the pro|vi&s;ions which had been purcha&s;ed for the children; and Emmiline begged to have the plea&s;ure of carrying the rolls her&s;elf to the cottage. "Amiable child!" ex|claimed her delighted mother, "would that my Clara's heart re&s;embled thine!"</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="036274_0015_100869221D8BF318">
Peter uttered a thou&s;and ble&s;&s;ings on his dear young <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, whom he had &s;o often carried when an infant in his arms. "This is &s;o like Mi&s;s Emmiline," he cri|ed, "&s;he is for doing good to every one; do you remember, Agnes, the pre&s;ent &s;he made me, la&s;t winter, in the &s;evere fro&s;t we had. I was ju&s;t recovered of a fit of the rheumati&s;m, and was going out with the carriage for the fir&s;t time, when &s;he called me into the hall, and gave me a pair of the nice&s;t wor&s;ted gloves, to pre|vent, as &s;he kindly &s;aid, my having a re|turn of the complaint in my hands. Ble&s;s her little generous heart, how proud I was of them!"</P>
<P>In this manner the whole party pro|ceeded to the cottage; Clara lingered &s;till behind; and pre&s;ently, as &s;he was looking another way, her foot &s;lipped. and &s;he fell into a narrow ditch, into which ran a &s;mall rivulet; in endeavoring to ex|tricate her&s;elf, her hands and her face were torn in a terrible manner by the bram|bles, before any a&s;&s;i&s;tance could be given.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="036274_0016_1008692464C65A38">
Madame de St. Clair&punc; as &s;he helped the &s;ervant to wa&s;h off the dirt which her per&s;on and clothes had received, &s;aid to her, "You are now, my daughter, to all appearance, in a wor&s;e &s;ituation than the poor cottager, who&s;e &s;olitary home we are preparing to vi&s;it; and would you like, becau&s;e your frock is dirty, and you are this di&s;agreeable figure, that we &s;hould for&s;ake and leave you in the road? How would you &s;ubmit to be treated with in|difference? And yet I fear you are but too much inclined to de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e whom the iron hand of misfortune has render|ed objects of contempt to the thought|le&s;s and unfeeling." "Oh! pardon me, my dear mamma, do not think &s;o, do not &s;uppo&s;e me proud or in&s;en&s;ible. I am in|deed very &s;orry to have given you cau&s;e to imagine I could&mdash;" Here her voice faultered, the tear of contrition gli&s;tened in her eye, &s;he attempted to take her mother's hand. Madame de St. Claire made no effort to withdraw it. "I hope," &s;aid this affectionate mother,
<PB N="19" REF="036274_0017_10086927774FF150">
"you will no more give me cau&s;e for re|proof on this &s;ubject. May time, and a few years' experience, convince you, my dear girl, that an amiable di&s;po&s;ition is the ba&s;is of all dome&s;tic felicity.</P>

<P>THEY &s;oon after arrived at the cottage, of which they found that Peter had given no very exaggerated de&s;cription. It was almo&s;t &s;urrounded by trees, which &s;pread a nightly gloom over the lonely habita|tion; one end of which had already fall|en into decay, and indeed there was but one part which appeared any way habit|able. The mo&s;s which grew upon the thatch, and the vine that encircled the lowly roof, almo&s;t concealed the &s;hatter|ed lattices. Amid&s;t this ruinous &s;cene, they were &s;urpri&s;ed to ob&s;erve, a little way off to the left, a &s;mall garden, which appeared to be cultivated with the great|e&s;t
<PB N="20" REF="036274_0018_100869290F3EE4A0">
care and order. Here they &s;aw a little boy about nine years old, very bu&s;y in clearing the cuttings of &s;ome trees that had been newly lopped, who, on perceiv|ing them, left his occupation; and, after re&s;pectfully bowing to the &s;trangers, pa&s;&s;|ed on to open the little wicket which led to the &s;hadowed entrance. Madame de St. Claire and her family followed their young conductor, and were pre&s;ently welcomed by its aged ma&s;ter, who thus acco&s;ted them, "Thanks, kind lady, for having deigned to accept the &s;helter this poor hovel affords. It is a pitiful place, and unworthy &s;o noble a gue&s;t; yet, be|lieve me, you are &s;incerely welcome to all it contains. Fear not to enter; the&s;e old walls have &s;tood many a &s;tormy night. Though &s;o ruinous, the part which I now inhabit, I have rea&s;on to think, is perfect|ly &s;afe. Come, my little friends," add|ed he, taking the children by the hand, "I have &s;ome new milk, a &s;tray cow which &s;eemed the only living animal in this &s;olitude when I fir&s;t came to it, fur|ni&s;hes
<PB N="21" REF="036274_0019_1008692B6C26C3D0">
us with that, and I believe the vine, ancient as it is, will yield a few grapes." "Oh! Father", exclaimed the little boy, "I will go and gather &s;ome of my larg|e&s;t apples, and be&s;t pears, for the compa|ny!" "Do &s;o, my love," he replied. Then conducting them into a &s;mall but neat room, he led Madame de St. Claire to the only chair it pre&s;ented, be&s;ides which, two &s;tools, a table, and a narrow wooden bench, were all the furniture it could boa&s;t of. If Madame was plea&s;ed with the apparent &s;implicity of every thing around her, &s;he was not le&s;s &s;o with her venerable ho&s;t, who&s;e countenance be&s;poke a generous and feeling heart, though the traces of affliction were &s;till vi&s;ible on this manly cheek. The little boy &s;oon returned with the fruit, and the rural &s;tores were produced on a table, the whitene&s;s of which was &s;carcely &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by the &s;now on the &s;ummit of the moun|tains. Peter, Agnes, and the po&s;tillion, remained at the door, and &s;hared their peaceful meal under the &s;hade of an aged

oak, round the rugged trunk of which a &s;eat had formerly been erected; the re|mains of it now afforded comfortable re&s;t to the&s;e weary travellers; for not all the eloquence of Madame, or the venerable man, could per&s;uade the hone&s;t people to eat a mor&s;el in the &s;ame room with their mi&s;|tre&s;s; and except one de&s;tined for repo&s;e by its owner, there was no other habitable.</P>
<P>"I am rejoiced we came here," whi&s;|pered Henry to his mother, "what nice fruit! and then the old man is &s;o civil!" He had great rea&s;on for this remark, as the cottager was particularly attentive to the young folks. Clara was the only one to whom his politene&s;s gave any confu|&s;ion. It brought to her mind all &s;he had &s;aid re&s;pecting the cottage and the owner of it. The recollection was painful, and it prevented her feeling that plea&s;ure which the others enjoyed.</P>
<P>The evening pa&s;&s;ed away in the mo&s;t cheerful manner, and it was concluded that Peter &s;hould &s;et off early in the morning for further a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to repair the carriage.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="036274_0021_1008693007BE3550">
In the inner room, the good old Albert (for that was the name of their ho&s;t) had contrived to make up two beds for Mad|ame, Agnes, and the children; whil&s;t the po&s;tillion remained in an outhou&s;e with his hor&s;es, him&s;elf, Peter, and the little boy, &s;lept &s;oundly till daybreak on &s;ome clean &s;traw and dried ru&s;hes; perhaps they had never enjoyed more comforta|ble repo&s;e, for when the mind accommo|dates it&s;elf to circum&s;tances, it is not the little inconveniences of life that can affect us.</P>

<P>The land&s;cape at this &s;pot was extreme|ly picture&s;que. It was not a public road; they were pa&s;&s;ing a precipice; above this were others extending to an amaz|ing height; the &s;cattered hamlets on who&s;e &s;ummit appeared but as a few al|mo&s;t imperceptible &s;pecks; nearer were &s;een cottages above the clouds, pa&s;tures which &s;eemed &s;u&s;pended in the air, ex|hibiting the mo&s;t delightful &s;cenery that can be conceived. Below, on the left, were cattle grazing; &s;ome of which ap|peared no larger than the &s;malle&s;t birds; to the right, a fore&s;t, who&s;e thick inter|woven trees &s;eemed to form an artificial night; beyond this the pro&s;pect opened, and the di&s;tant village became vi&s;ible by degrees, as its lowly &s;pire caught the &s;un's uninterrupted ray.</P>
<P>Here it was, that, feeling them&s;elves fatigued, they &s;at down to re&s;t, under the

Henry and Emmiline &s;aid their's perfectly, but Clara was very ob&s;tinate, and owned &s;he thought it hard they were compelled to learn any thing when on a journey, and that &s;he would not take any pains to get her's. "You prefer ignorance, then to a few hours application?" &s;aid their af|fectionate mother. "Believe me, Clara, before the lap&s;e of many years, you will &s;everely repent this negligence, and wi&s;h you could recal even the moments you have &s;pent in idlene&s;s and folly. The in|jury is not to me; it is <HI>you</HI> who will feel the con&s;equences of this perver&s;e behav|ior. You will be ignorant, you will be de&s;pi&s;ed."</P>
<P>"Oh! no, mamma! that I &s;hall not; I know enough already." And the thought|le&s;s girl &s;kipped away as cheerfully as the others, with whom their indulgent moth|er had &s;o much rea&s;on to be &s;atisfied.</P>

<P>"You are willing, I &s;ee, good Mad|am," &s;aid he, "to enjoy all the delight of the country. Is there any plea&s;ure that can exceed that of a morning walk at this charming &s;ea&s;on? My little friends, I &s;ee, are al&s;o charmed with the beauties nature here pre&s;ents to us." "Yes, &s;ir," replied Henry, "all but my &s;i&s;ter Clara; I am &s;orry to &s;ay, &s;he has no ta&s;te for what is &s;ublime and beautiful. To me, no &s;ight is &s;o glorious as the ri&s;|ing or &s;etting &s;un, I could gaze on it for ever; I would not be &s;uch an in&s;en&s;ible mortal as &s;he is for the world."

<P>The children were confounded, no one &s;o much as Henry. They were unable to reply. "I &s;ee," &s;aid he, "my que&s;tion is a little two difficult for my young phi|lo&s;ophic friend, who another time will not be &s;o ready to call his &s;i&s;ter an in&s;en|&s;ible mortal; &s;ince his youthful capacity is found to be not yet equal to every &s;ub|ject. But that the &s;ame que&s;tion may not occa&s;ion you any further embarra&s;&s;|ment, I will tell you why we receive great|er heat from the &s;un in &s;ummer than in win|ter. Though then <HI>nearer</HI> to us, his rays fall more obliquely, in &s;ummer more di|rect: con&s;equently, we then receive the greater heat. Have you never put your hand &s;ideways to a candle? and, have you not remarked that you could, in that po&s;ition, almo&s;t touch the flame

without being burnt? but when you have held your hand directly over it, have you not at &s;ix times the di&s;tance found it in|&s;upportable?" The children acknowl|edged the truth of what he had &s;aid, and thanked him for having &s;o well explain|ed the &s;ubject to them, and all, except Emmiline, &s;eemed willing to change the conver&s;ation, who thus continued, "You &s;aid, &s;ir, we were nearer the &s;un in win|ter than in &s;ummer. How <HI>can</HI> this be? I am &s;ure our hou&s;e at Paris always &s;eem|ed to &s;tand in the &s;ame place; if it had moved nearer the &s;un at any time, we mu&s;t have felt it." "And yet, my little darling, it is certain that the earth moves &s;ixty eight thou&s;and two hundred and forty three miles every hour, and that we are carried along with it in open &s;pace. The &s;un, the moon, the &s;tars, &s;eem to make a revolution in the heavens; but it is in reality the earth that moves. Lend me, young lady, the cup and ball you were playing with ju&s;t now." When, taking it by the &s;tring, he whirled it
<PB N="31" REF="036274_0029_100869439C365210">
round his head, &s;aying, "We will &s;up|po&s;e this little ball the earth, and my head the &s;un, do you ob&s;erve that as it goes round, it de&s;cribes al&s;o a &s;mall circle round the &s;tring? This may be com|pared to the diurnal motion of the earth, which turns as you &s;ee this ball, upon an imaginary line within, called its axis. It is this motion which produces day and night." "But how," interrupted the children, "can we move &s;o fa&s;t, and not be &s;en&s;ible of any motion?" "Have you not been in a &s;hip?" &s;aid Madame de St. Claire, "and did not the trees, the land, and every object on the &s;ide of you appear to move?"</P>
<P>"Oh! yes, mamma," replied Emmi|line, "and I recollect it was with diffi|culty you made me comprehend that it was not the trees, but the ve&s;&s;el, which moved."</P>
<P>"Well, then, cannot you imagine that the motion of the earth a contrary way produces the apparent motion of the hea|vens from ea&s;t to we&s;t? We are not &s;en|&s;ible
<PB N="32" REF="036274_0030_100869451EFA82F0">
of the motion of the earth, being no more on this globe, in compari&s;on, than a fly would be on a ball of wax as large as our chariot."</P>

<P>The attention of the young people was attracted from this &s;cene of indu&s;try, by a noi&s;e, which &s;eemed to be the exclama|tions of &s;ome per&s;on in di&s;tre&s;s a few pa|ces from them; when, turning out of the direct path to &s;ee what was the mat|ter, they beheld a &s;paniel extended on the ground, apparently dead, and on one &s;ide, a goatherd lamenting over it, in all the agony of &s;evere&s;t grief. "What thus di&s;tre&s;&s;es you, my lad?" exclaimed Al|bert. The boy did not even turn his head to &s;ee from whence the voice pro|ceeded; his eyes were fixed on the lifele&s;s animal before him. They ob&s;erved him take up its paw, bathe it with his tears, pre&s;s it to his lips, and then put it down again. "Poor Carlo!" &s;aid he, "thou ha&s;t followed me many a dreary mile, but the flinty roads &s;hall no more cut thy tender feet&mdash;Carlo!&mdash;" and again

convul&s;ive &s;obs for a few minutes in|terrupted his &s;peech; at length he re|&s;umed: "Thou art cold&mdash;dead!&mdash;I mu&s;t pur&s;ue alone each day's hard journey.&mdash;Thou wilt no more climb the craggy mountain, or gambol through the valley. But at noon, when I &s;et me down be|neath the &s;heltering willow by the clear brook, and take from my &s;crip the &s;canty mor&s;el&mdash;it is then, Carlo! I &s;hall mi&s;s thee&mdash;for thou wa&s;t accu&s;tomed to partake its &s;tore. At night too&mdash;for the&s;e fifteen years ha&s;t thou &s;lept be&s;ide me!

<P>The voice of Albert, who by this time had come up to the lad, interrupted his &s;oliloquy.</P>
<P>"You lament the lo&s;s of this poor ani|mal?" &s;aid he. "Ah! &s;ir," replied the
<PB N="38" REF="036274_0036_10086953C8B6D9A8">
boy, advancing a few &s;teps, then-retrcat|ing as if unwilling to leave the remains of what had been &s;o dear to him; "you know not how much he de&s;erves to be lamented. Yet, if he had died a natural death, I think I could have borne it bet|ter, but to be deprived of him by a mali|cious hand!&mdash;He is killed&mdash;the blood is now running from the wound where the ball entered his head. My Carlo!" and he threw him&s;elf on the ground be&s;ide him.</P>
<P>"But tell us," &s;aid Albert, "by what means you lo&s;t your favorite?"</P>
<P>The goatherd, rai&s;ing him&s;elf upon his elbow, thus continued, "Returning from the mountains this morning, I was &s;tar|tled with the report of a gun, a few yards from me, but could perceive no per&s;on near, the thickne&s;s of the&s;e trees perhaps concealed them. Carlo was at a little di&s;|tance, I called him&mdash;he &s;taggered towards me&mdash;the gunner had taken two &s;ure an aim&mdash;for in a few minutes he expired at my feet.

<P>"My &s;u&s;picions, I fear; are but too well founded," replied the pea&s;ant; "there is a gentleman in this neighbor|hood who has long wi&s;hed me to part with my dog, and even offered me mon|ey for him; but the large&s;t &s;ums he could have given, would not have purcha&s;ed my Carlo.

<P>Alas! &s;ir, his &s;teward in|formed me a few days &s;ince, that if I would not let his ma&s;ter have the dog, he threatened to have it de&s;troyed by &s;ome means or other, as a puni&s;hment for my daring to refu&s;e &s;uch a trifle to a man of his con&s;equence. Ah! little did I think his heart would &s;uffer him to put the threat in execution. Why do I &s;ay his <HI>heart;</HI> he could not have any. Yet, I did not imagine he would kill my Carlo!&mdash;"</P>
<P>Saying this, he threw him&s;elf again up|on the dog, and &s;obbed aloud.</P>

<P>I have thought of &s;ome|thing. He grieves for the lo&s;s of his dog, becau&s;e it &s;upplied to him the place of a friend. It is dead&mdash;he has none now. But if I might, (looking tenderly at Albert) I think I could recommend one who could comfort him in all his troub|les. (Taking Albert's hand) May I a&s;k you, &s;ir! to be a friend to this unfortu|nate lad? Mamma, I am &s;ure, will con|tribute &s;omething with us to render his &s;ituation in life more comfortable; but to his mind, who could give the com|fort of your &s;alutary coun&s;els? Your friend&s;hip, therefore, would be more to him than all that <HI>we</HI> could do&mdash;Yes, I know you will be his friend.</P>

<P>Albert took the charming girl in his arms, and &s;uffered her to wipe off a tear from his venerable cheek, which her &s;en|&s;ibility had excited. "I will comply with your generous wi&s;hes," &s;aid he, af|fectionately embracing her.</P>

<P>The goatherd, overpowered by a va|riety of emotions, was unable to &s;peak.&mdash;He knelt down&mdash;rai&s;ed his eyes to heaven, as if thankful for a re&s;toration of its ble&s;&s;ings, and pre&s;&s;ed the hand of the old man to his lips.</P>
<P>At length they per&s;uaded him to ac|company them to the cottage; where, to pa&s;s an hour or two, it was imagined might divert a melancholy, not all at once to be overcome; for though grate|ful as he appeared for their favors, Car|lo could not be forgotten. He turned back often to look for the &s;pot where they had left him, and frequently pa&s;&s;ed his hand acro&s;s his eyes to bru&s;h away the &s;tarting tear.</P>
<P>When he became more compo&s;ed, Henry a&s;ked him if he did not intend, by &s;ome means or other, to puni&s;h the inhuman man who had killed his dog? "Ah! no," he replied, "what would
<PB N="43" REF="036274_0041_1008695F86B8AC30">
that avail? it would not re&s;tore my Car|lo; and what plea&s;ure is there in re|venge? I have it every day in my pow|er to return his cruelty. His dogs make great havoc among&s;t our flocks, but I have not hurt one of them, nor ever will; although my ma&s;ter has &s;poken to him &s;everal times, he will not keep them upon his own grounds. Poor and igno|rant as I am, I have not forgotten the le&s;|&s;on of humanity my father taught me, "To do good to all, but no injury even to an enemy." By this time they had reached the cottage, where they found a rural breakfa&s;t prepared by the little boy and Agnes, to which the former had con|tributed all the rarities his garden could produce.</P>

<P>"And this is what I would refu&s;e to many," replied the old man, "but your kindne&s;s de&s;erves all my confidence; and although it may be painful to recal to remembrance the pa&s;t events of my life, I will relate to you the misfortunes which have driven me to this &s;tate of poverty. "My name is de Livr&eacute;; my father was a reputable trade&s;man at Paris, and I was brought up to the &s;ame pro|fe&s;&s;ion.

<P>"The time of wearing mourning for my dear parents was &s;carcely elap&s;ed, when an intimate friend of my father's returned from India with his wife and daughter, the latter a mo&s;t amiable young

woman. In our infancy we were neigh|bors, and many of our youthful years had been &s;pent together. Nor were our parents le&s;s affectionately attached to each other. Mine were, alas&punc; no more. The meeting on both &s;ides was very affect|ing; our fir&s;t interview being in the &s;ame room where five years before we had parted with mutual regret; the fur|niture was the &s;ame, and every thing remained in its former &s;tate. It was a favourite apartment of my dear moth|er's, and I had determined nothing there &s;hould undergo the lea&s;t alteration, but retain the order &s;he had been accu&s;tom|ed to approve. Her chair kept its u&s;ual place; it was the fir&s;t to which I led Ame|lia. She &s;at down, and bur&s;t into tears; I was &s;carcely le&s;s affected; &s;ome min|utes elap&s;ed before either of us had pow|er to articulate a &s;yllable.

my boundle&s;s indulgence which laid the ba&s;is for the impropriety of his future conduct. He was of a lively turn of mind; and youthful frolic which mer|ited the cen&s;ure of parental authority, were too often con&s;idered as the over|flowings of a volatile di&s;po&s;ition. We had no other little one to &s;hare our affec|tion; in him was centered all the joy, the delight of our exi&s;tence; his every whim was complied with, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed abilities and a good under&s;tanding; but the&s;e were overvalued by our blind par|tiality.

&s;uch conver&s;ations, the advice of his grandfather was too often totally di&s;re|garded, or turned into ridicule. At length he became &s;uperior to all control, and we re&s;olved to place him at an academy, the ma&s;ter of which had been &s;trongly rec|ommended to us. He had been at this &s;eminary rather more than two months, when it plea&s;ed Heaven to take from us our worthy parent. Madame M&eacute;lone &s;urvived him only two years.

little happy circle, &s;eemed no longer to have any plea&s;ures for him; our &s;tyle of living became di&s;gu&s;ting, for in this we aimed at nothing which did not entirely corre&s;pond with our &s;ituation. What has a trade&s;man to do with elegance? My &s;on's ideas were very different from mine; he thought a &s;plendid appearance nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of our hou&s;e. When fir&s;t in partner&s;hip, he mu&s;t have two of the fine&s;t hor&s;es that could be pur|cha&s;ed, to carry him&s;elf and &s;ervant to wait on tho&s;e gentlemen who &s;ent for him on bu&s;ine&s;s.

<P>"It is true, a &s;eries of continued pro&s;|perity had enabled me to lay by a few thou&s;ands, but millions would have been too little for his &s;upport. Our trade, heretofore &s;o flouri&s;hing, daily declined as his extravagance increa&s;ed. The gen|eral

<P>"He married a beautiful woman of no fortune, who&s;e di&s;po&s;ition bore too great a re&s;emblance to his own for her ever to attempt a reformation. Gay, good humored, and imprudent, but too much the fine lady to attend to the duties of her family; the care of which was left entirely to &s;ervants, who took advantage of her negligence to ha&s;ten the ruin of her&s;elf and her hu&s;band, by an exorbitant wa&s;te of every thing.</P>
<P>"My Amelia, who was the be&s;t of wives and mothers, endeavored often to in&s;pire her with a love of neatne&s;s and economy, but &s;he was too young and thoughtle&s;s to give ear to any argument o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;ubject."</P>

In the mo&s;t pa|thetic parts, Emmiline had been ob&s;erv|ed to put her handkerchief to her eyes; and when De Livr&eacute; left off &s;peaking, &s;he jumped upon his knee, and throwing her little arms around his neck, exclaim|ed, "Wicked boy! to behave &s;o ill to &s;o good a father! but do not grieve a|bout him now; mamma, I am &s;ure, will always be your friend, and if we are not too young, let <HI>us</HI> be your friends al&s;o?

<P>AFTER dinner, Mon&s;ieur de Livr&eacute; thus continued his intere&s;ting narrative: "Although my &s;on had now a family of five children, he &s;till continued to &s;quan|der away va&s;t &s;ums to enable him to keep up an acquaintance with his youthful di&s;|&s;olute companions, who &s;eemed to aim at nothing but the completion of his ru|in. It was in vain I repre&s;ented to him the injury my circum&s;tances had &s;u&s;|tained, and exhorted him to be more prudent. He relied on the flattering promi&s;es of his friends, as he called them, and a&s;&s;ured me all would yet be well; that we &s;hould &s;oon be able to bid adieu to the fatigues of a commercial life; that they would place us in a &s;ituation where we &s;hould have nothing to do but enjoy our&s;elves in ea&s;e and &s;plendor. Mi&s;taken young man! I was not ac|quainted with half his imprudence, till
<PB N="55" REF="036274_0053_1008697C182E52A8">
going one day into a &s;ilver&s;mith's to have a trinket repaired of my dear Amelia's, I left my addre&s;s, that it might be &s;ent home when fini&s;hed. The &s;hopman had no &s;ooner looked upon the card, than he de&s;ired me to do him the favor to &s;top a few minutes. Odd as this reque&s;t appeared, I complied with it, and I &s;aw him go to his ma&s;ter then in the Compt|ing hou&s;e; who told me, with a &s;tately air, he could not po&s;&s;ibly do any thing more till the long account betwen us was &s;ettled. A&s;toni&s;hed, I demanded what that account could be! As he was perfectly a &s;tranger to me, having never entered his &s;hop before, "It is no &s;mall affair!" he replied, "three hundred pounds!" "Three hundred pounds!" I exclaimed, "you mu&s;t be mi&s;taken, I am not the per&s;on you &s;uppo&s;e me." "I beg your pardon, &s;ir! I have notes of hand which you have &s;ent me from time to time, as &s;ecurities for payment." "Let me &s;ee them," cried I eagerly; they were pre&s;ently produced, and I im|mediately
<PB N="56" REF="036274_0054_1008697D9A0D4BD8">
recollected my &s;on's hand. A terror &s;eized me: I was near fainting; the &s;hopman, perhaps more compa&s;&s;ion|ate than his ma&s;ter, ob&s;erving my di&s;or|der, offered me a chair, and I thus ad|dre&s;&s;ed the &s;ilver&s;mith, as &s;oon as I could articulate a word, for my agitation had for a few minutes deprived me of &s;peech: "you are mi&s;taken, &s;ir, I again repeat, I am not the per&s;on you &s;uppo&s;e me to be, though nearly related to him. It is my &s;on, unfortunately, who is your debtor; I would defray the whole account this moment were it in my power; but at pre&s;ent it gives me the deepe&s;t concern to &s;ay it is not, for I have no doubt your demand is a ju&s;t one. However, here are bills, taking out my pocket book, to the amount of fifty pounds, and I will endeavor in the cour&s;e of a few days to &s;ettle the remainder.</P>

<P>"ONE morning, taking a &s;olitary walk through la Rue St. Germaine's, I was followed by two ragged boys, who a&s;ked charity of me. "For God's &s;ake, &s;ir," &s;aid the elde&s;t, "give &s;ome|thing

to this poor child, who has not courage to beg, though &s;tarving; his father is dying, there is a wretched mother, and four more of them." "I was in&s;en&s;ibly affected by the intere&s;t the beggar boy took in the fate of his little indigent friend, in whom I recol|lected the features of my grand&s;on, and followed his &s;teps to the abode of the wretched family. It was a mi&s;erable garret; I arrived in time to receive my &s;on's la&s;t &s;igh; who expired in my arms. They had lived, I found, in this wretch|ed manner ever &s;ince he left me &s;o ab|ruptly, upon the little produced by the pledging of their clothes. You will con|ceive the &s;ituation of my daughter and the helple&s;s infants. I had no home to take them to, from this &s;cene of mi&s;ery; but, with the few &s;hillings I had about me, I prevailed on the landlady to per|mit them to pa&s;s two days in another apartment, and took the elde&s;t boy with me to my friend's hou&s;e.</P>

"My dear wife, overcome with fa|tigue and affliction, I found had not been able to leave her bed that day. My friend met me with his u&s;ual cheerful|ne&s;s. He &s;aw &s;omething had happened to di&s;tre&s;s me; and, at his reque&s;t, I relat|ed to him the mi&s;ery of which I had been a &s;pectator. He de&s;ired me to be com|forted, &s;aying he would him&s;elf vi&s;it the unfortunate mother, and do &s;omething for their relief. It was in vain I urged him not to think of it, nor injure his circum&s;tances by relieving ours. "Be under no apprehen&s;ions of this &s;ort, my good friend," he replied, "the plan I mean to adopt &s;hall not injure any one. A&s;k no que&s;tions.

<P>"I mu&s;t not omit to tell you the means by which this generous man be|came able to a&s;&s;i&s;t us. In one of the a|partments,
<PB N="62" REF="036274_0060_1008698CE17B9820">
I was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee the place vacant where an elegant organ had &s;tood. I had entered this room one morning, the door being open, to ad|mire a very fine picture, which hung op|po&s;ite. A &s;ervant coming in for &s;ome|thing for his ma&s;ter, I enquired whither the in&s;trument had been removed? He replied, his ma&s;ter had di&s;po&s;ed of it, he believed, for a great &s;um of money. An idea of his generous plan immediately glanced through my mind. I &s;aw him pa&s;s the door of the apartment where I was, and in a moment threw my&s;elf into his arms. But all my expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude but feebly expre&s;&s;ed the feel|ings of my heart. "Forbear, my friend, to &s;peak on this &s;ubject," cried he, ten|derly pre&s;&s;ing my hand, "what I have done is trifling. Fond as I am of mu&s;ic, the in&s;trument never gave me half the plea&s;ure I have felt in the di&s;po&s;al of it, for you and yours; but that plea&s;ure is not perfect till I have your approbation of my proceedings. We will vi&s;it your

I was &s;urpri&s;ed when we came to a &s;mall neat hou&s;e in the out&s;kirts of the city, to be told my daughter and her children re&s;ided there. We had the &s;atisfaction of finding her better than could be expected. My friend had furni&s;hed a little &s;hop for her, and there &s;eemed a pro&s;pect of happier days, when this unfortunate mother was &s;eiz|ed with a fever, and after a few days ill|ne&s;s expired, leaving four helple&s;s little ones. In the mid&s;t of this di&s;tre&s;s, my friend &s;till remained faithful to me. He a&s;&s;i&s;ted in placing them at &s;chool, where the two elder &s;urvived their parents but a &s;hort time, and the younge&s;t not more than a twelvemonth; he &s;ettled us again in bu&s;ine&s;s; but, my Amelia's frame was not equal to the rude &s;hock of misfor|tune.</P>
<P>"She died! two months after my daughter in law. This was one of tho&s;e troubles to which human fortitude is

In trade I was again for a few months &s;ucce&s;sful, and contin|ued in it till the death of my only friend. There &s;eemed then nothing left to attach me to the world; &s;orrow had injured my health; I could not pur&s;ue my oc|cupations with my former vigor.

<P>A great deal, mamma. See this gold box; I love it becau&s;e papa gave it to me, but he cannot be angry that I part with it to Albert.

<P>IN a few hours the purcha&s;es were made, and the happy party returned to the cot|tage. It was agreed that Mon&s;ieur de Livr&eacute; &s;hould that evening make his ap|pearance in his new attire; and Emmi|line in&s;i&s;ted on having the plea&s;ure of decking out her little friend, who re|ceived their pre&s;ents with a thou&s;and thanks. Tears were the only language of the venerable de Livr&eacute;. "Why does he cry?" demanded Emmiline; "I fear, mamma, we have not done enough." Then running up to him, "Let me wipe away tho&s;e tears, my <HI>good</HI> friend. When I am a great girl, and papa allows me more money, I will lay it all by for <HI>you!</HI>" "I am overwhelmed with your goodne&s;s, my dear friends," at length
<PB N="70" REF="036274_0068_1008699FD8E1FEC0">
exclaimed the cottager; "but the tears I &s;hed, my affectionate young lady, are tears of JOY, the <HI>&s;incere&s;t</HI> JOY." "Of JOY!" repeated Emmiline, "I thought people only cried when they were un|happy or di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. I cry when mam|ma is di&s;plea&s;ed with me, becau&s;e I am grieved I have offended her; and I have &s;een mamma cry but it was when dear papa was ill, and then, I am &s;ure, &s;he cri|ed becau&s;e &s;he was in trouble. Pray let us &s;ee you &s;mile, and we &s;hall think you are really happy." It was &s;ome time be|fore Madame de St. Claire could con|vince her daughter, that the extreme ei|ther of joy or &s;orrow might give ri&s;e to the &s;ame emotions.</P>
<P>At length the appointed morning came, when they were to bid adieu to the &s;olitude in which they had experien|ced &s;uch a portion of uninterrupted plea&s;|ure and &s;atisfaction. It was with real regret they took leave of their worthy friend, who, after affectionately embrac|ing the children, took them each &s;epa|rately

in his arms to the carriage, while they exclaimed, in accents &s;carcely audi|ble, "God ble&s;s you! Ble&s;s our good friend de Livr&eacute;!" The carriage drove away.&mdash;Grief would not permit the good man to bid them a &s;econd adieu. They gazed at him until a turn in the road prevented their enjoying longer this gratification, and &s;oon even the lowly habitation cea&s;ed to be di&s;cernible. They had travelled &s;ome miles. The children were unable to overcome their dejection; when Madame de St. Claire endeavored to divert their thoughts from the melancholy &s;eparation, to the beauties of the &s;urrounding country; but it exhibited &s;cenes which the &s;orrow of the pre&s;ent hour would not &s;uffer them to contemplate with any &s;en&s;ation of de|light. "That you are concerned to leave a per&s;on who has treated you with &s;o much kindne&s;s, is not &s;urpri&s;ing. It would have &s;hewn an in&s;en&s;ibility of heart, not to have been affected; but, it is wrong to give your&s;elves up to this

immoderate grief. We &s;hall &s;ee Mon|&s;ieur de Livr&eacute; again in the cour&s;e of a few months, and we are a&s;&s;ured, it will not be long before we have the plea&s;ure of hearing from him, and ought we not to feel &s;ome con&s;olation in having left him in ea&s;ier circum&s;tances? If you con|tinue thus to give way to fruitle&s;s &s;or|row, you will not be able to bear the fa|tigues of your journey. Be cheerful, I beg of you. Emmiline, I know, loves a &s;tory. Henry and Clara, I believe, can &s;ometimes take plea&s;ure in one; and I think, I know a &s;hort hi&s;tory which would amu&s;e you, at lea&s;t for a few min|utes."

<HEAD>THE DISAPPOINTMENT.</HEAD>
<P>"WHAT joy!" exclaimed Sophia to her &s;i&s;ter, one morning as they left their apartment; "this day is come at la&s;t!&mdash;The birth day of our dear cou&s;in. We are to go to the ball this evening. How I love a ball! how happy we &s;hall be! I will wear my new frock that is &s;o prettily trimmed, with my &s;ky blue &s;a&s;h." "And I," interrupted Mary, "tho&s;e pretty &s;lippers, which mamma bought for me the other day." At breakfa&s;t nothing was &s;poken of but the expected plea&s;ures of the evening; the &s;ame &s;ub|ject was continued till dinner time, and their little heads were &s;o much taken up with the thoughts of a dance, that they could not apply them&s;elves to a &s;ingle le&s;&s;on. Their governe&s;s complained of their inattention. Throwing their arms
<PB N="74" REF="036274_0072_100869A9BA878540">
around her neck, they exclaimed, "Ex|cu&s;e us, dear Madam, to day, we cannot apply our&s;elves; it is the day of the ball, our dear cou&s;in's birth day, whom we have &s;een but once &s;ince her return from the continent. Pray, pray excu&s;e us; indeed we will be very a&s;&s;iduous tomor|row." "It is enough," replied their amiable in&s;tructre&s;s, "I do not forget that I was once young as you are, and yield to your &s;olicitations. We will &s;et a&s;ide all bu&s;ine&s;s for today." The morn|ing pa&s;&s;ed away with all the &s;en&s;ations of delight which hearts young as their's only could experience. "Why, mam|ma," &s;aid Sophia, as they were at table, "are you not as cheerful as we are? You are going to the ball with us, but you do not &s;eem &s;o joyful, and I often ob&s;erve, my dear mamma, that you have tears in your eyes; yet, if we &s;peak to you, you <HI>&s;mile,</HI> and in a moment all your &s;orrow &s;eems to be gone." "Do not, my love, que&s;tion me on this &s;ubject," &s;aid the good mother, "you are as yet

<P>Soon after, a &s;ervant entered with a note. It was to &s;ay that the young lady (Sophia and Mary's cou&s;in) was taken &s;uddenly ill, and obliged to put off the ball till another day. The countenance of the children betrayed every emotion of vexation and di&s;appointment, as their mamma read aloud the unplea&s;ant intel|ligence. "I would not give any thing to go another time," cried Sophia, "I had thought with &s;o much plea&s;ure of this evening.&mdash;I &s;hall not be able to wear my pretty frock for I know not how long, and then the charming dance we &s;hould have had!" "I know," in|terrupted Mary, "it will be put off from

Mrs. Lambert, who ob&s;erved and pitied their unea&s;ine&s;s, when the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of their grief began to &s;ub&s;ide, thus addre&s;&s;|ed them: "I am very &s;orry, my dears, you are deprived of this long expected plea&s;ure, and more &s;o that your co&s;in's ill health prevents her having the enjoy|ment of her friends' &s;ociety. But we mu&s;t not &s;uffer our&s;elves to be too much affected by trifles. If her life was in danger, you would have rea&s;on for the&s;e tears; but by a letter I have ju&s;t receiv|ed from her mother, I am informed that her indi&s;po&s;ition is by no means alarm|ing&mdash;quietne&s;s is pre&s;cribed, and I have no doubt but in a few days we &s;hall hear of her perfect recovery. Since the ball is deferred, we mu&s;t endeavor among&s;t our&s;elves to pa&s;s this evening as agreeably as we can; but, then, I mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t that you throw off this dejection, and appear with your accu&s;tomed cheerfulne&s;s.

"No, my dear mamma," &s;aid Sophia, drying her eyes, "we will not give you cau&s;e to be di&s;plea&s;ed with us. We will be cheerful. What &s;hall we do to amu&s;e you?" "Shall we play or &s;ing to you, dear mamma?" demand|ed Mary, ki&s;&s;ing her hand. "Neither, my love," replied this indulgent parent, "I am &s;o plea&s;ed with this your effort to oblige me, in drying up your tears, that I mu&s;t think of &s;omething for <HI>your</HI> amu&s;ement. We will go and drink tea with the good woman of the farm, whom we have &s;een but once &s;ince we came into the country." "What!

The evening was one of the mo&s;t de|lightful for a walk: Mrs. Lambert and the young people were joyfully welcom|ed by the amiable cottager, who, in a few minutes liberally &s;et before them the homely productions of her little tene|ment.</P>
<P>While partaking of the&s;e, a beggar at the gate excited the curio&s;ity and atten|tion of her &s;prightly gue&s;ts. For the plea&s;ures of the afternoon had rai&s;ed even the depre&s;&s;ed &s;pirits of Mrs. Lam|bert. The per&s;on who a&s;ked their char|ity was an elderly woman, accompanied by a beautiful child, who appeared to be not more than ten years of age. They were cleanly dre&s;&s;ed, though their clothes were ragged. "Alas!" &s;aid the poor wanderer, "it is not for my&s;elf I implore your benevolence; I am old&mdash;the days of my life will &s;oon be at an end.&mdash;It is for this dear child&mdash;&s;he is well born, and de&s;erves a better fate.

the unfortunate wretch who now begs upon her knees a bit of bread for her. Oh! do&mdash;do not refu&s;e it, &s;he is ready to faint with fatigue; we have travel|led many a weary mile through rugged roads to day; and la&s;t night&mdash;I thought I &s;hould have lo&s;t her&mdash;no one would give us &s;helter from the &s;torm, we brav|ed its fury in the fore&s;t&mdash;ah! &s;uch a night. This dear child, though thus for&s;aken, is amiable, and worthy of all that can be done for her." Mrs. Lam|bert, affected almo&s;t to tears, de&s;ired the aged &s;upplicant to come in. "Give us," &s;aid &s;he, "&s;ome account of your&s;elf and of the dear child you have thus pro|tected, my good woman: But fir&s;t drink a little milk, it will do you good. You have greatly intere&s;ted us. Sit down, you &s;eem very much fatigued." Mary and Sophia immediately offered their ba&s;ons to the little girl. "Heaven ble&s;s you, Madam!" &s;aid the woman, as &s;he took the milk, "our &s;tory is a long one; but you have humanity, and

<P>"It is now almo&s;t &s;ix weeks &s;ince we were driven by a wicked landlord (lately come to his e&s;tate) from our habitation. He was a proud, au&s;tere, avaricious man. The &s;ight of our humble dwelling was a mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting &s;pectacle to him; he ordered his &s;teward to have it pulled down, and to &s;end the inhabitants away. This man, not le&s;s cruel than his ma&s;ter, would not li&s;ten to our &s;upplications, nor even permit us to &s;tay and pack up our few clothes; as if he had not &s;hewn in this &s;ufficient &s;everity, he demanded the immediate payment of all that was due to him; a great &s;um to me at that time, for bad health had rendered me for ma|ny months incapable of doing any thing towards earning any money for our &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence; and all that I had formerly laid up had been expended for the &s;up|port and education of this dear innocent. Ah! there was once a time, when we were in a better &s;ituation; but the death
<PB N="81" REF="036274_0079_100869BAD1910E18">
of my dear hu&s;band reduced me to pov|erty. I could no longer keep her at &s;chool, and after having &s;old the greate&s;t part of our furniture, I rented this hut, about three miles from St. Albans, where, by my daily labor I have &s;upported this dear child, and when not able to work, &s;he has been &s;o good, &s;o kind to me in all my &s;ickne&s;s&mdash;It was then her indu&s;try maintained us both." "She is your niece, I imagine," &s;aid Mrs. Lambert, "perhaps a brother's unprotected daugh|ter!" "Ah! no, Madam, &s;he is born of nobler parents. In me you behold her nur&s;e, the attendant of her helple&s;s years. Her father and mother, when they &s;et off for America, con&s;igned her to my care, and proud was I of the pre|cious charge! My hu&s;band being at that time in bu&s;ine&s;s, we were pro&s;perous and happy. The charming girl became eve|ry day dearer to us. Had &s;he been our own, we could not have loved her bet|ter. What is there now that I would not do for her? For her dear parents&mdash;

alas! they are dead&mdash;perhaps buried in the profound aby&s;s of the &s;ea! I have received but one letter &s;ince their depart|ure." "What was their name?" a&s;k|ed Mrs. Lambert with emotion. "My ma&s;ter's name was Lambert, Colonel Lambert&mdash;" replied the woman. "Heav|ens!" exclaimed the affectionate moth|er, "is it, can it be po&s;&s;ible? But tell me your own?" "El&s;on, Madam." With increa&s;ing &s;urpri&s;e, Mrs. Lambert caught the child in her arms, and pre&s;&s;|ing her to her bo&s;om, thus continued, "Is it not an illu&s;ion? Do I live to embrace again my daughter, after hav|ing vainly &s;ought her for &s;o many years! My dear, my fir&s;t child?

In a moment the good wom|an was upon her knees before Mrs. Lambert, and pre&s;&s;ing her hand with fer|vor: "My dear, my beloved mi&s;tre&s;s! do I live to &s;ee you once again, to re&s;tore this darling to a mother's arms, to &s;ee you happy? Now I &s;hall die content. Receive my prayer, oh! Father of the friendle&s;s. Pre&s;erve and ble&s;s this dear, this worthy family! But," looking earne&s;tly around her, "one is wanting; my good ma&s;ter!" "He is well, my affectionate nur&s;e," replied the joyful parent, "and is now in England. Oh! let us ha&s;ten home to re&s;tore to him his long lo&s;t child." "It was then for the lo&s;s of our dear &s;i&s;ter, mamma," &s;aid the children, "that we have &s;een you &s;o of|ten &s;orrowful. Dear, dear Caroline! how happy we are to you. Good nur&s;e, we will love you as well as you have loved our &s;i&s;ter."

<P>The children were delighted to &s;ee their faithful &s;ervant, to whom they could have wi&s;hed to have addre&s;&s;ed a thou|&s;and que&s;tions; but it was getting late, and their mamma thought it time they &s;hould retire to re&s;t, after the fatigues of &s;o long a journey.</P>

<P>Clara, hurt and offended at her broth|er's officiou&s;ne&s;s, retired to the farthe&s;t part of the room. Her mamma enter|ed &s;oon after, and enquired what was the matter. "Oh! do not a&s;k me," &s;aid Emmiline, "Clara will tell you." Madame then turning towards Henry, &s;eemed to demand an explanation from him; though &s;evere as his conduct had been to his &s;i&s;ter, when they were alone, the reproof he had once received from de Livr&eacute; came at this moment acro&s;s his mind, and he was determined to be &s;i|lent, rather than appear ungenerous or ill natured; he was not naturally &s;o, and when he erred in this re&s;pect, it was through thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s, not from a de|pravity of di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Madame de St. Claire, going up to Clara, thus addre&s;&s;ed her: "I am in|deed concerned to &s;ee this &s;orrowful countenance, my dear girl; you have left, it is true, a few friends behind you,

<P>"Your pre&s;ent conduct is highly di&s;|plea&s;ing to me, for I imagined you would have endeavored to render your &s;ociety as agreeable as po&s;&s;ible, in your dear fa|ther's ab&s;ence.

She &s;aid &s;he did not want to &s;ee flowers and trees, they could afford her no amu&s;ement. "I am &s;orry to perceive, my dear," &s;aid her mother, "that in your pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition there is not any thing which <HI>could</HI> give you plea&s;ure."

"Good bye, Mi&s;s Sulky," cried Henry, as they were going out; "I hope you will be in better temper when we re|turn." "And by what authority do you call your &s;i&s;ter names, Henry!" &s;aid Madame de St. Claire, "you know I do not &s;uffe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> this impertinence; &s;he merits my di&s;plea&s;ure, but not your in&s;olence.

"Think no more of it, my dear brother, I am mo&s;t to blame, for having given you rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e I merit it." Henry, to whom his mother's di&s;plea&s;ure gave the great|e&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s, dared not again approach her, till Emmiline had &s;aid &s;omething in his favor. "Mamma," &s;aid this charming girl, "you will permit Henry to walk with us! will you not? He is grieved he has offended you; I &s;hall not have half the plea&s;ure if he does not go

Emmiline then led him to|wards Madame de St. Claire, who thus addre&s;&s;ed him: "You are &s;en&s;ible, my &s;on, you have committed a fault; but this contrition makes me hope you will never again incur my di&s;plea&s;ure by a repetition of it. You have my entire forgivene&s;s." They then proceeded to the garden. It was kept in admirable order, and there were a variety of beau|tiful plants and flowers; the nature and names of which Henry and Emmiline were de&s;irous of being acquainted with. They had &s;carce gone over all the differ|ent walks, before the bell &s;ummoned them to dinner. Clara had cea&s;ed cry|ing, but had not re&s;umed her u&s;ual cheer|fulne&s;s. The children &s;poke in raptures of their morning ramble, and were &s;ur|pri&s;ed to &s;ee, as &s;oon as the cloth was removed, the carriage drive up to the door. "I propo&s;e," &s;aid Madame de St. Claire, "to make a little excur&s;ion

You do not remember it, I believe, Henry, for you were very young when you u&s;|ed to accompany me thither; and took great delight in playing with and run|ning after the wild goats. As for Clara, who imagines there can be no kind of amu&s;ements at a di&s;tance from Paris, we will leave her to divert her&s;elf as &s;he thinks proper at home." The mi&s;tak|en girl now indeed began to repent of not having &s;hared the plea&s;ures of the morning, and left &s;ome de&s;ire to be of the party; but her mamma would not hear of it, and left her to the charge of the good Jaqueline, to whom &s;he gave &s;trict injunctions not to behave to her with the lea&s;t familiarity; as her con|duct had been &s;uch as &s;he could not en|tirely approve.</P>

<P>THE dairy was about four miles from the chateau, a thatched dwelling, over which an old vine extended its luxuriant branches almo&s;t on all &s;ides, who&s;e pur|ple clu&s;ters over&s;hadowed the narrow lattices. By the door was a bench en|circled with woodbines and ivy, the fa|vorite &s;eat of the aged cottagers, when the declining &s;un put a period to the la|bors of the day. As they approached, they were &s;urpri&s;ed with the &s;ounds of mu&s;ic. The merry tabor echoed among the hills, and its cheerful notes &s;eemed to announce an eve of fe&s;tivity. Seve|ral young pea&s;ants were &s;een dancing on the lawn, at a little di&s;tance from the hou&s;e. "Oh! look, mamma," &s;aid Henry, "here is a ball! How prettily the young girls are dre&s;&s;ed, and how plea&s;ed they look! I never &s;aw any fine ladies at Paris look half &s;o happy,

even in your drawing room. But they have all wreaths of white ro&s;es round their heads; what can this mean?" On a &s;udden the mu&s;ic pau&s;ed&mdash;the appear|ance of a carriage had for a while &s;u&s;|pended the &s;portive &s;cene. Madame, alighting with the children, begged they would continue their diver&s;ion, while they &s;poke a few words to the good old couple, who had &s;eated them&s;elves be|neath the exten&s;ive branches of an aged oak; which for &s;everal years had been the ornament of their &s;olitude.</P>
<P>The worthy people ro&s;e at the ap|proach of a &s;tranger. "Good Heav|ens!" exclaimed the herd&s;man, "is it Madame de St. Claire I &s;ee?" "Yes, Marcilen, we are come once more to vi&s;|it you. How does my good dame? But do not let us interrupt your &s;port. It is a fe&s;tival I &s;ee, and &s;ome of tho&s;e young people, I &s;uppo&s;e, are your chil|dren." "Yes, and plea&s;e you," replied the herd&s;man's wife; "that young woman in white is our elde&s;t daughter,

&s;he was married this morning to the lad you &s;ee dancing with her; &s;o we invit|ed a few neighbors to make a kind of holiday. The two girls to the left of her are her &s;i&s;ters, and that &s;tripling who is &s;itting down yonder is our &s;on." "Thank God!" continued Marcilen, "we are very happy in our children; they are our greate&s;t comfort, and though Lucinda is married &s;o well, we &s;hall be &s;orry to lo&s;e her; but we &s;hall enjoy her dear company a few days longer, as they will not go to their own habitation this fortnight. Dear Mad|am, do walk in, and partake of &s;ome re|fre&s;hment; or, perhaps, you would like to have it here better." Madame de St. Claire expre&s;&s;ing a wi&s;h to remain a &s;pectator of the rural f&ecirc;te, he called to his &s;on Louis to bring a little table, and ordered him to get &s;ome fruits and new milk for the vi&s;itors. "It is long," &s;aid the happy pea&s;ant, "&s;ince we had this honor, and we mu&s;t let our young neigh|bors enjoy their &s;port an hour the long|er,

to welcome our noble gue&s;ts." On a &s;ignal given, the dance again began. Henry and Emmiline, after they had partaken of the homely, though deli|cious entertainment, joined the merry throng; and never had any amu&s;ement afforded them &s;uch delight. "How charming it is to dance in the open air!" cried Henry, &s;kipping up to his mamma, "and then what a delightful evening! I wi&s;h Clara was here, I am &s;ure I &s;hall not be tired the&s;e three hours." And he joined again his little partner. "You are very happy here?" &s;aid Madame to the herd&s;man. "Yes, my good lady, our flocks are pro&s;perous, and indeed we have not a &s;ingle care. We work hard, it is true, but cu&s;tom has worn away that difficulty; and the recreations of the evening are the &s;weet|er for the toils of the day. A thou&s;and trifles, that would perhaps affect others, do not give us a moment's unea&s;ine&s;s. We have never accu&s;tomed our&s;elves to look for perfect felicity; yet are happy

as it is po&s;&s;ible for mortals to be. We have health and dutiful children, in our labors we are &s;ucce&s;sful, and what el&s;e could we de&s;ire? Ah, Madam! how often do I wi&s;h, when I meet a fine car|riage on the high road, that its owners were as happy as we are!" "But you do not dance every evening, I pre&s;ume?" &s;aid Madame. "No, good lady," re|plied Jacine, (for that was the name of the herd&s;man's wife) "but our children amu&s;e us, we have a few books, and they take it by turns to read to us; Louis plays on his pipe too, now and then, and the girls &s;ing to it; Lucinda, they &s;ay, has a very pretty voice. A mu|&s;ic ma&s;ter, who came into this part of the country about two years &s;ince, would have given her &s;ome in&s;tructions for nothing, but it would only have made her vain, and taken her mind from things of more importance, &s;o we declined his generous offer. Her wild note plea&s;es us, nor do we wi&s;h her better informed. But you would think the&s;e merits were

<P>Madame de St. Claire chatted with the&s;e good people and their family, till the falling dew warned her it was time to return. The children wi&s;hed for an|other dance, but &s;he was fearful of their taking cold. Accu&s;tomed to regard her will as the rule of their inclinations, without a murmur they cheerfully &s;tep|ped into the carriage, nodding to the happy groupe as long as they remain|ed in &s;ight. "I &s;hould like," exclaim|ed Henry, "to vi&s;it the&s;e hone&s;t people every day. Why is not every body &s;o happy?" "Becau&s;e," replied Madame, "there are few who have rightly con&s;id|ered what is the ba&s;is of <HI>true happine&s;s.</HI>
<PB N="101" REF="036274_0099_100869E6B3ABB4F8">
They imagine it con&s;i&s;ts in the gratifica|tion of their de&s;ires, and a pur&s;uit of plea&s;ure. We have &s;een an example to the contrary, in the&s;e worthy pea&s;ants; who, without forming one extravagant idea in the &s;earch of true felicity, find it in contentment. Indeed, happine&s;s is much nearer to us, than we are often in|clined to think, when our pa&s;&s;ions and our caprice prevent our enjoyment of it. I rejoice that the &s;cene we have witne&s;&s;|ed, has made &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion on your minds. You have &s;een health and hap|pine&s;s the reward of virtue and indu&s;|try."</P>
<P>For the fir&s;t two miles of their return, the dairy furni&s;hed matter for conver&s;a|tion. As it grew darker, the children's attention was attracted by the number of &s;tars that then &s;hone forth with their brighte&s;t lu&s;tre; and they reminded their mother of the promi&s;e &s;he had made, to give them further information relating to a&s;tronomy.

<P>You &s;ay, mamma, the plan|ets are like our earth; how can this be? They appear only little bright things not larger than a &s;pangle.</P>

<SPEAKER>MADAME.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet there are &s;ome as large, and others larger than the earth. The rea&s;on of their appearing &s;o &s;mall, is their immen&s;e di&s;tance from us. Do you not perceive a very &s;mall light be|tween tho&s;e trees?</P>

<P>That light proceeds from the Chateau. It is a candle they have placed in one of the windows. As we approach nearer, you will be able to di&s;|tingui&s;h it; and it will appear as large as it really is. Do you comprehend now why the &s;tars appear &s;o &s;mall?</P>

What an augu&s;t, what an amazing conception does this give us of the works of the Creator!

<P>They were welcomed home by the re|pentant Clara, who&s;e countenance bore the &s;tronge&s;t marks of &s;incere contrition. Though not faultle&s;s, &s;he had an affec|tionate heart, in which her mother's di&s;|plea&s;ure

At their next vi&s;it to the dairy, &s;he was per|mitted to accompany them; and ac|knowledged there were &s;ome plea&s;ures to be enjoyed even at a di&s;tance from the metropolis. Far from finding the time hang heavy on their hands, or expe|riencing the dullne&s;s of &s;olitude, after having pa&s;&s;ed a few months in this re|tirement, they owned they had never been &s;o happy. Madame de St. Claire diver&s;ified their employments in &s;uch a manner, that they had always &s;omething new to learn, or to be informed of.

<P>THEY had been more than a twelve-month at the Chateau, when one morn|ing Henry and his &s;i&s;ters a&s;ked leave of their mother to take a walk before break|fa&s;t with Agnes, to a beautiful &s;ituation, about two miles off, where they pro|po&s;ed endeavoring to &s;ketch &s;ome views.</P>
<P>Being arrived at the &s;pot, they were &s;ome time &s;eeking where to place them|&s;elves; at length Henry exclaimed, "Oh! what a delightful pro&s;pect is here! Tho&s;e trees to the left thrown in|to &s;hade, and the cottages in the fore|ground, will make a charming land|&s;cape; and how it will plea&s;e mamma, to &s;ee I can draw from nature." "And how delighted &s;he will be with a draw|ing of mine," interrupted Clara; "I &s;ee a beautiful &s;ubject&mdash;that bridge and the mill at a di&s;tance. Agnes, give us the paper and pencils; Emmiline, do not

She had begged a bit of paper, and began to amu&s;e her&s;elf by trying to draw one of the herd&s;man's huts, which &s;he &s;aw at a little di&s;tance. Henry eagerly &s;et about his view, but found it not quite &s;o ea&s;y to accompli&s;h as he at fir&s;t imagined. It was &s;ometime before he could produce any repre&s;enta|tion of what he wi&s;hed. At length he exultingly called his &s;i&s;ter Clara to come and look at his outline. On her ap|proach, he cried, "I have got it quite right at la&s;t; &s;ee, Clara, how exact I have been. Now I have only to color it, and then it will be fini&s;hed." His &s;i&s;ter &s;aid, &s;he thought he had better do it in Indian ink, as he had not begun to draw in colors, and mo&s;t likely, by attempt|ing it now, he might &s;poil his land&s;cape. "And &s;o you would have me give mam|ma this charming view only in black and white? It would be very like it to be &s;ure!

Say what you will, I am &s;ure it will be better than your's; for you know even your out|lines mamma &s;ays are very incorrect." Henry found more difficulty in the col|oring than he expected. His yellow was too bright, and endeavoring to &s;often it, he had given it the appearance of a dirty brown. Vexed at not being able to &s;ucceed to his expectation, he put the drawing in his pocket; not permitting even his &s;i&s;ters to look at it, but hurry|ing

them from the delightful &s;pot. Cla|ra had ju&s;t fini&s;hed her's, and from not attempting more than &s;he could per|form, had &s;ucceeded better.</P>
<P>On their return, in a lane leading to the chateau, they were acco&s;ted by a poor boy, who begged of them to buy &s;ome little birds which he held up for their ob&s;ervation in a broken cage. "Pray do, my good ladies; my poor father is very ill, and my moth|er not able to leave her bed." "If this be true," interrupted Agnes, why do you not work for them, in&s;tead of car|rying the&s;e birds about to &s;ell; by which, it is certain, you cannot obtain much towards their &s;upport?" Alas! Mad|am," he replied, "Heaven knows how willingly I would work now for them, would any one employ me: But I have been a very undutiful boy to them; I did not like labor, and the farmers and herd&s;men, knowing my former indo|lence, will not now take me into their &s;ervice; but my dear father, my dear

mother, they will die, if I cannot earn &s;omething for their &s;upport." Emmi|line exclaimed, Let us buy the&s;e pretty creatures, Agnes. There are &s;ix of them, ju&s;t two a piece. What do you a&s;k for them, little boy?" "Oh! whatever you plea&s;e to give me," he replied, &s;ob|bing. Each immediately produced their pur&s;e; but Clara, as &s;he opened her's recollected the promi&s;e of her mamma to take them that day to a neighboring fair; at which, the preceding evening, &s;he had given them a little &s;um to pur|cha&s;e what &s;hould plea&s;e them mo&s;t. She he&s;itated, looked at her brother, then at Emmiline, then at the almo&s;t naked object before her. "Your fa|ther, your mother are ill," &s;he exclaim|ed, in a tender accent; "and I have it in my power to do &s;omething for them. Why &s;hould I deliberate? Take this tri|fle. If it procures them ea&s;e, I &s;hall not regret the want of the trifles it was de&s;|tined to purcha&s;e." "But," &s;aid Hen|ry, "if we &s;pend all our money, perhaps
<PB N="112" REF="036274_0110_10086A016F4C3338">
mamma will not take us to the fair." "Should that be the ca&s;e," replied Em|miline, "I am &s;ure &s;he will not be di&s;|plea&s;ed with us; and the &s;atisfaction of having done &s;omething for the&s;e poor people, will afford us plea&s;ure, even &s;hould we be di&s;appointed. Poor boy! take this, (putting into his hand five &s;hil|lings) and get &s;omething with it for your parents." Henry added his &s;hare, but with unu&s;ual reluctance; having re&s;erv|ed it for the purcha&s;e of a new &s;et of ninepins. "I &s;hall not have what I have &s;o long wi&s;hed for," &s;aid he to him&s;elf, as he gave the money, "but what of that? The reflection of having done a good action will be preferable." The lad, a&s;toni&s;hed at the &s;ight of what to him was an immen&s;e &s;um, returned thanks on his knees for their bounty. Emmiline took the cage, and they con|tinued the road to the chateau. Agnes, unob&s;erved, &s;tepped back to enquire in what part of the country the wretched family dwelt, in hopes &s;he might have it

<P>Poor boy! Oh! mam|ma, if you had but &s;een him, he looked &s;o &s;ad. No &s;hoes or &s;tockings upon his feet, and his coat was all in tatters. Then his parents are &s;o ill. If I had had a guinea in my pocket, I am &s;ure I &s;hould have given it to him. I thought, mam|ma, if you had been ill, what I &s;hould have felt; and this thought made me pity him, though you would have had every thing that was comfortable; but the&s;e poor people have not even nece&s;|&s;aries.</P>

<P>"Good girl," exclaimed Madame, tak|ing her in her arms and ki&s;&s;ing her.

<P>While the carriage was getting ready, the children exhibited the &s;ketches they had made. Madame de St. Claire was much plea&s;ed with Clara's attempt. "And where is yours, Henry?" &s;he de|manded. "Oh! mamma," he repli|ed, taking it from his pocket, "you will not be &s;o well &s;atisfied with this. I have &s;poiled it in the coloring.

<P>If I may tru&s;t the appearance of your pre&s;ent behavior, it &s;peaks a &s;incere repentance. I am there|fore no longer di&s;plea&s;ed with you.

To endeavor to render them &s;o, is the arduous duty of a tender pa|rent: By cautiou&s;ly guiding the in|fant heart, and guarding it by precept and examples of pure morality, from every attack of vice, or the influence of ungovernable pa&s;&s;ions.</P>

When her mother entered, &s;he fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the floor, and was conveyed by Agnes to another room. The &s;ur|geon was tying up Henry's arm, for he had bled him, when Madame, &s;carce able to &s;upport her&s;elf, &s;at down by him. "Do you think, &s;ir, my dear boy will recover?" "Certainly, Madam," he replied, "the brui&s;es he has received may confine him a &s;hort time, but I do not apprehend any danger; I would ad|vi&s;e his being put immediately to bed, and kept very quiet, and I reque&s;t no per&s;on except your&s;elf and his nur&s;e may go near him."

three days that the dear little fellow was confined, this affectionate sister never left him; she had her own bed brought to the side of his, and gave him with her own hand whatever he wanted, scarcely suffering any other to approach him. Clara was also very attentive, and shewed the greatest concern at her broth|er's indisposition. At the expiration of a week, he was able to set up the whole day, and Clara and Emmiline did all in their power to amuse him; the latter brought into his chamber one evening, her cabinet of shells. "I have thought of a charming entertainment," said the affectionate girl, addressing Madame de St. Claire, "we will look over these cu|riosities, and you will tell us the names of those we are not acquainted with.

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT this time, Madame de St. Claire and her children paid the prom|i&s;ed vi&s;it to Mon&s;ieur de Livr&eacute;, whom they found in perfect health; and rend|ered by their benevolence the happie&s;t of mortals.</P>
<P>The cottage had been repaired, and pre&s;ented to the eye, in lieu of its form|er de&s;olate appearance, a neat and com|modious dwelling. It was furni&s;hed in the &s;imple&s;t &s;tyle, and de Livr&eacute; had hir|ed
<PB N="4" REF="036274_0144_10086A52AFE2CA00">
the daughter of a neighboring pea&s;|ant to keep it in order.</P>
<P>The garden had been enlarged, with many improvements, and the path clear|ed from brambles, which led to a plea&s;|ant eminence beyond it. This winding walk was now planted with ro&s;e trees, je&s;&s;amine, and the &s;weete&s;t &s;hrubs. At the top Mon&s;ieur de Livr&eacute; had erected a ru&s;tic edifice, to which, a few days after their arrival, he conducted his good friends. This &s;pot commanded a beau|tiful view of the adjacent country. "It is here, my little friends," &s;aid he, "that I hope now and then to be favored with your company. You have no doubt made &s;ome progre&s;s in a&s;tronomy &s;ince I had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you; and will not this be a charming place to pur&s;ue your &s;tudies in? See what an expan&s;e of horizon there is around us! I had (he added) your improvement and plea&s;|ure in view, when I con&s;tructed this; I looked forward to your promi&s;e of vi&s;|iting me, and wi&s;hed to make my &s;oli|tude
<PB N="5" REF="036274_0145_10086A552CC570E8">
as agreeable as po&s;&s;ible to my wor|thy benefactors. There are too many clouds this evening for us to trace out the different con&s;tellations, but the fir&s;t evening that is more favorable I hope you will accompany me hither."</P>
<P>The children, delighted with the pro|po&s;al, returned their artle&s;s thanks, and waited with impatience the following evening, which proved all they could wi&s;h for. The air was &s;erene, and not a cloud perceivable, even to the utmo&s;t verge of the horizon.</P>
<P>Struck with the beauty of the &s;itua|tion the preceding day, the children beg|ged to drink tea on the mount, that they might have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing the &s;un &s;et from thence. Their wi&s;hes were cheerfully complied with; and they watched the decline of that glori|ous luminary, till the refulgency of its rays &s;eemed lo&s;t in the &s;mooth waters of the di&s;tant lake.</P>
<P>"How odd it is," &s;aid Emmiline, "that the &s;un &s;hould &s;et!" "It does
<PB N="6" REF="036274_0146_10086A5775491530">
not really &s;et," replied Henry; "at the moment we cea&s;e to &s;ee it, it ri&s;es to tho&s;e inhabitants of the earth who live directly oppo&s;ite to us. See, it is almo&s;t out of &s;ight, and pre&s;ently it will be quite dark; but, mamma, I do not en|tirely comprehend the cau&s;e of day and night."</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MADAME.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I will endeavor to ex|plain it to you. You have been informed, that the earth turns upon its axis once every twenty four hours. It is this mo|tion which cau&s;es a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of day and night; for, as the &s;un can enlighten on|ly one half of the earth at one time, the other half mu&s;t be in darkne&s;s; and as this motion of the earth will cau&s;e the different places on its &s;urface to revolve through the light and the dark in twen|ty four hours, in that time, of cour&s;e, tho&s;e places mu&s;t have a day and a night, and at the in&s;tant when it is midday at one place, it mu&s;t be midnight at the oppo&s;ite. Do you under&s;tand this?</P>

<SPEAKER>HENRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perfectly, mamma, I now recollect you explained it to us at the time you mentioned the change of the &s;ea&s;ons; which we could not enjoy but for the inclination of the earth's axis twenty three degrees and a half from its orbit. Yet this axis always keeps the &s;ame po&s;ition, and is directed to|wards one and the &s;ame &s;ide of the heav|ens, moving from We&s;t to Ea&s;t, in the time of its turning three hundred and &s;ixty five times and a quarter. I think I can al&s;o account, mamma, for our not &s;eeing the &s;un always &s;et at the &s;ame point of the horizon. Does it not ari&s;e from the difference in the length of our days and nights, and the inclination of the earth's axis?</P>

<SPEAKER>MONS. DE LIVRE.</SPEAKER>
<P>This faint light&punc; vi&s;ible in our atmo&s;phere after &s;un&s;et, particularly in the We&s;t, and which we call twilight, is occa&s;ioned partly by the refraction and reflection of the rays of the &s;un in our atmo&s;phere. By atmo&s;|phere is meant the air we breathe, that which &s;urrounds us on all &s;ides. In this atmo&s;phere the &s;un's rays are &s;o refract|ed, (that is, broken and di&s;per&s;ed) as to afford us that equal light which we call twilight, till the &s;un has &s;unk eighteen degrees below the horizon.</P>
<P>The &s;un has al&s;o an atmo&s;phere: His rays, reflected upon this, produce what is called <HI>zodiacal light,</HI> which &s;ometimes appears, but particularly towards even|ing in &s;pring, and in autumn towards the morning. The duration of twilight is generally about two hours. About the fir&s;t of March and eleventh of Octo|ber

our twilights are the &s;horte&s;t; when the &s;un does not de&s;cend eighteen de|grees below the horizon, the twilight la&s;ts all night.

<P>Should you like it to be dark night immediately as the &s;un is &s;et? If we had no twilight or atmo&s;phere to reflect the &s;un's rays, this mu&s;t be the ca&s;e.

They come up every evening, and we contrive always to have &s;ome little provi&s;ion for them. The vegetables are all the pro|duce of my grand&s;on's garden, the labor of his lei&s;ure hours; and I believe, were the que&s;tion put to him, he could not de|termine which he has the mo&s;t plea&s;ure in, rearing them for me or them.

They aro&s;e at five in the morning, to get their le&s;&s;ons, and write their exer|ci&s;es; and when Madame came down to breakfa&s;t, they were all ready to repeat them, although their excur&s;ions were not to commence till the evening; which proving a fine one, they prefer|red walking. Mon&s;ieur de Livr&eacute; was delighted with their ob&s;ervations by the way, and not le&s;s &s;o with their behavior in every cottage they entered.

"The &s;ame," replied Madame, I am wife to that worthy man; the&s;e are his beloved children; but tell me, how was he when you left him?"

I de&s;igned, immediately on my return to France, to make enquiry for your place of re&s;idence; but the joy of meeting again my dear parents, pardon me, Madam, had almo&s;t made me forget the charge I was entru&s;ted with." Saying this, he gave the packet to Madame. It contained the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory intelli|gence,

"With all my heart," replied the cotta|ger, "I had always an affection for the dear girl; but when we could &s;carcely &s;upport our&s;elves, it would have been cruel to have &s;uffered her to become a &s;harer in our poverty.

<P>Come, be not &s;o ha&s;ty in cen&s;uring, my young friend. Tell me what it is that produces the &s;prings you &s;peak of?</P>
<P>Henry looked confu&s;ed, and knew not what to an&s;wer.</P>
<P>I think the young gentleman is a little at a lo&s;s, as well as the young lady, which in him is the le&s;s excu&s;able. Springs<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sturm's Reflections.</NOTE> are produced either by heavy &s;nows, or the clouds which tho&s;e heights are al|ways covered with; and it is that which keeps up the cour&s;e of great and &s;mall rivers. I need not mention to you the utility of the&s;e. Be&s;ides the advantages of &s;prings and fountains, for which we are indebted to mountains, they have many others. Several kinds of animals, who&s;e fle&s;h or &s;kins are &s;erviceable to us, find there a dwelling, and it is the moun|tains that afford them &s;u&s;tenance without our labor. On the &s;ides of mountains are found an infinite number of &s;alutary
<PB N="30" REF="036274_0170_10086A8D2F0FF558">
herbs and roots, which cannot be culti|vated with equal &s;ucce&s;s in the plains, or have not the &s;ame virtues; minerals and metals are formed in the bowels of mountains, which would not propagate &s;o well, in low and level countries, for want of nece&s;&s;ary moi&s;ture. By the&s;e we are al&s;o &s;heltered from the bleak bla&s;ts of the Northern and Ea&s;terly winds, and it is on them the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite vines are fo&s;tered. Though &s;ome inconveniences may ri&s;e from them, the&s;e ought not to make us overlook the various ble&s;&s;ings they afford us.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMMILINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! &s;ir, I &s;hall never again behold a mountain, without enu|merating the advantages we derive from it; and I now perceive, that in creation
<PB N="31" REF="036274_0171_10086A904B65FFD0">
there is nothing u&s;ele&s;s; every part de|mon&s;trates the power and wi&s;dom of that Being who formed the perfect whole.</P>
<P>The &s;un had-been long &s;unk below the horizon, before they reached the direct road to de Livr&eacute;'s abode; and from the adjacent meadows a thick dew began to ari&s;e. "Look, mamma," &s;aid Clara, "what a thick fog is coming over tho&s;e fields, it was not &s;o ju&s;t now; whence does it proceed?"</P>
<P>"What you &s;uppo&s;e to be fog," &s;aid Mon&s;ieur de Livr&eacute;, "is the ri&s;ing dew."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMMILINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what makes the dew? Whence comes it? This gra&s;s is al&s;o quite wet with it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DE LIVRE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dew is nothing more than the &s;weat of the plants, and the moi&s;ture they draw from the earth. It is ea&s;y to conceive how it is formed. The heat of the &s;un's rays continually loo&s;ens a multitude of thin particles from off every thing; &s;ome of which ri&s;e into the atmo&s;phere, and the re&s;t collect in the form of drops of water. Thus it
<PB N="32" REF="036274_0172_10086A9294379D08">
is, that the dew is &s;ometimes hurtful and &s;ometimes not; its nature depending on the quality of the vapors which com|po&s;e it. The lighter exhalations are car|ried away by the wind as &s;oon as form|ed, which prevents them from falling in drops. This is the rea&s;on, that when the air is calm as it is this evening, there is mo&s;t dew.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I love a calm evening, but I hate windy weather; I think it would be much plea&s;anter if there were no winds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DE LIVRE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You now &s;peak without thought, my dear. Innumerable are the benefits we derive from the winds:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nature Di&s;played</NOTE> Af|ter long continued &s;ea&s;ons of &s;ultry heat, the &s;ea oftentimes very opportunely &s;ends a We&s;t wind, which gives a &s;ea&s;on|able refre&s;hment to all nature; but as a continuance of this moi&s;t wind would prove prejudicial to the inhabitants and fruits of the earth, it is generally order|ed by the cour&s;e of nature, that it &s;hould
<PB N="33" REF="036274_0173_10086A951C3F1828">

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HENRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hould think, &s;ir, it would wing its way along the continent from A&s;ia to Europe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DE LIVRE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, my dear. The North wind comes armed with millions of frozen particles of air to precipitate, di&s;per&s;e, or conden&s;e, the malignant and unwhole&s;ome vapors of autumn; la&s;tly, the &s;harp edge of the North wind is tak|en of by that genial warmth which the South wind diffu&s;es through the air, kindling fre&s;h life and vigor in every part of nature. The&s;e perpetual vici&s;&s;i|tudes &s;erve to vary the di&s;po&s;itions and productions of the earth; they correct or prevent tho&s;e ill con&s;equences which would re&s;ult from any one fixed and permanent &s;tate of things, and purify the air, by keeping it in con&s;tant motion. Without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of winds we &s;hould be poi&s;oned in our hou&s;es, and
<PB N="34" REF="036274_0174_10086A976A9440D8">

<SPEAKER>CLARA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thank you, &s;ir, for pointing out to me all the&s;e advantages. I had now rather that my bonnet &s;hould blow off &s;ix times in a minute, than be depriv|ed of the winds, whatever inconvenience I may experience from them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HENRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wonder, Clara, you do not accu&s;tom your&s;elf to reflect before you &s;peak, you have made your&s;elf appear very ignorant by wi&s;hing there were no winds.</P>

<P>Are you always wi&s;e e|nough, Henry, to reflect before you &s;peak? If you were, I think it would prevent tho&s;e &s;allies of ill nature, which too often e&s;cape you on the conduct of tho&s;e whom you otherwi&s;e e&s;teem.</P>
<P>Henry looked a&s;hamed, and walked &s;ilently on, till they arrived at the &s;olita|ry abode. The villagers had received their daily allowance, and the little pea&s;|ant had prepared the rural &s;upper, which

con&s;i&s;ted of all the fine&s;t produce of the garden, and a brace of partridges, which the grand&s;on of de Livr&eacute; had &s;hot in the morning. As a recompence for their good behavior, the children were that night permitted to &s;it up an hour longer than u&s;ual, and to partake of what the table afforded.

<P>Clara, I am concerned to ob&s;erve, has a fretfulne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, which, if not corrected, will be a contin|ual &s;ource of unea&s;ine&s;s to her&s;elf, and will increa&s;e as &s;he grows older.

For in|&s;tance, when Mon&s;ieur de Livr&eacute; returns from his walk, will he not conclude that &s;he is tired of the vi&s;it, and di&s;&s;atisfied, although he has done &s;o much to make it agreeable to us all.

<P>Clara and Emmiline were &s;o indu&s;tri|ous that by the afternoon the frock was completed. They then &s;et out for the valley, accompanied by Madame de St. Claire and de Livr&eacute;. By the children's direction, they &s;oon arrived at the wag|goner's abode, who&s;e mother received them with &s;urpri&s;e and gratitude. Mad|ame conver&s;ed with the good woman re&s;pecting her lamene&s;s, and promi&s;|ed to &s;end her a &s;trengthening plai&s;ter, of which &s;he knew the efficacy.

"It is yours," &s;aid Madame, returning it after having (as &s;he imagined) unperceived &s;lipped in a

Ob&s;erving the paper to be a bank note, "Oh heavens!" cried the poor woman, "this for my chil|dren?" Then, while the tears of heart|felt gratitude bedewed her venerable cheeks, &s;he thus continued: "May the hand of Providence &s;hower on you its <HI>choice&s;t ble&s;&s;ings;</HI> may you experience ev|ery plea&s;ure, every comfort! Would you could form &s;ome idea of that you have this day given to a widow's heart! My children, hone&s;t, amiable, indu&s;tri|ous, but ignorant, will now receive the advantages of education: Your gene|ro&s;ity has enabled me to procure it for them, and made me the happie&s;t of mothers."</P>
<P>During this &s;cene, Emmiline and her &s;i&s;ter had retired to a corner of the apart|ment, and were bu&s;ily employed in put|ting on the frock they had made. The little girl, who had never &s;een her&s;elf &s;o

"Look! look! mamma, what a fine frock! and the&s;e ladies &s;ay I am to keep it; they have made it for me. Oh! I wi&s;h Billy was at home to &s;ee how &s;mart I am, and to thank them for all their goodne&s;s to us. See, mamma, they have brought al&s;o this bundle of things for him."</P>
<P>Henry and Jo&s;eph were not le&s;s &s;orry that the waggoner was ab&s;ent; for they wi&s;hed to have &s;een him again, but he never returned till late in the evening. However, at taking leave, they promi&s;ed to repeat their vi&s;it before they left that part of the country.</P>
<P>The &s;un was &s;etting as they returned, and the young people did not fail to re|mind their friend of the plea&s;ures of the mount. "What a charming evening," they exclaimed, "will this be, for a con|templation of the &s;tars!"</P>

Dr. Her&s;chel has di&s;|covered volcanos or burning mountains in the moon. Three of the&s;e he ob&s;erv|ed in different places of the dark parts of the planet; two of them appeared nearly extingui&s;hed, or probably going to break out; the third was an actual eruption of fire or luminous matter; this ob&s;ervation was made on the 20th of April, 1787.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>DE LIVRE.</SPEAKER>
<P>That the moon is &s;ur|rounded by an atmo&s;phere is rendered probable by many ob&s;ervations of the &s;olar eclip&s;es, in which the edge or limb of the &s;un was ob&s;erved to tremble ju&s;t before the beginning. The planets are

likewi&s;e ob&s;erved to change their figure from round to oval, ju&s;t before the be|ginning of an occultation behind the moon, which can be attributed to no other cau&s;e than that their light is re|fracted by being &s;een through the moon's atmo&s;phere.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>HENRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>The moon is a round o|paque body, which borrows light as well as the other planets from the &s;un. She is the &s;atellite and in&s;eparable compan|ion of the earth, and appears, from her nearne&s;s to us, to be the large&s;t in the &s;y&s;tem. Her diameter is two thou&s;and one hundred and eighty miles; her di&s;|tance from the earth two hundred and
<PB N="63" REF="036274_0203_10086AD9B49A81C8">
forty thou&s;and. She turns on her axis in twenty &s;even days &s;even hours and forty three minutes, and moves at the rate of two thou&s;and two hundred and ninety nine miles per hour.</P>
<P>Her periodical revolution of going round her orbit &s;he performs in twenty &s;even days &s;even hours and forty three minutes; her &s;ynodical, from the time of new moon to new moon, in twenty nine days twelve hours forty four min|utes and three &s;econds.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DE LIVRE.</SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;peak a little learnedly, my young friend. Pray, can you tell me what occa&s;ions the difference between the &s;ynodical and periodical revolution?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HENRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe it is cau&s;ed by the revolution of the earth round the &s;un, and the apparent motion of the &s;un in the ecliptic.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DE LIVRE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and thus it is that the moon takes up a longer time to pa&s;s from one conjunction to the next,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Adams on the Planets.</NOTE> than to de&s;cribe the whole orbit; or the time
<PB N="64" REF="036274_0204_10086ADB368D4D30">
between one new moon and the next is longer than the moon's periodical revo|lution. If the &s;un had no apparent mo|tion in the ecliptic, the moon would come up to it, or be in conjunction again after it had gone round in its orbit; but as the &s;un moves forward in the ecliptic while the moon is going round, the moon mu&s;t move a little more than once round before it can come even with the &s;un, or be in conjunction. Do you com|prehend this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HENRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perfectly, &s;ir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>EMMILINE.</SPEAKER>
<P>My brother has told us that the moon is round, but how hap|pens it then, that we &s;ometimes &s;ee her what we call three quarters old, and &s;ometimes no more than a thin bright cre&s;cent?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HENRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think I can account for this. As &s;he &s;hines with light entirely borrowed from the &s;un, and reflected by her &s;urface, it follows that, according to the po&s;ition of the beholder with re&s;pect to the illuminated part, he will &s;ee more
<PB N="65" REF="036274_0205_10086ADD840674E0">
or le&s;s of her reflected beams; for only one half of a globe can be enlightened at once; and the different appearances &s;he bears are called her pha&s;es; but Mon|&s;ieur de Livr&eacute; can no doubt explain it better to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DE LIVRE.</SPEAKER>
<P>When &s;he is in conjunc|tion, that is, between the &s;un and us, her illuminated &s;ide is then all turned to|wards him, and her dark to the earth, con&s;equently &s;he is then invi&s;ible. This is called new moon or conjunction. But when &s;he goes back towards the ea&s;t, and retires from under the &s;un, a &s;mall part of the illuminated &s;ide is vi&s;ible, and the horns of the cre&s;cent are turned towards the ea&s;t. At the end of &s;even days, when &s;he has reached a quarter of her cour&s;e round the earth, &s;he di&s;covers more and more of the illuminated &s;ide, till &s;he &s;hews us half of it. Her light part is then turned towards the &s;un, and the dark part ca&s;ts no light on us. Ex|actly half the moon is then enlightened, and we call this the fir&s;t quarter. At
<PB N="66" REF="036274_0206_10086AE0961DAAB8">
the end of &s;even days, reckoning from the fir&s;t quarter, it is almo&s;t directly op|po&s;ite to the &s;un, and its whole enlight|ened di&s;k pre&s;ents it&s;elf to us, ri&s;ing in the ea&s;t at the time the &s;un &s;ets in the we&s;t, and we have then a full moon. The more &s;he goes forward, the more the dark &s;ide increa&s;es, till at la&s;t half the dark &s;ide is turned towards the earth, and con&s;equently half the light &s;ide. It has then the form of half circle, and is what we call the la&s;t quarter. The&s;e different appearances are a demon&s;tra|tion that &s;he &s;hines with reflected light; for did &s;he &s;hine with her own, we &s;hould always &s;ee her round like the &s;un.</P>

St. Claire received a letter from a di&s;|tant relation, who with his family was come to re&s;ide in Switzerland; re|que&s;ting her to favor them with her company for a few days: &s;he would willingly have excu&s;ed her&s;elf, no place having in her e&s;timation the plea&s;ures of home, nor any &s;ociety, in the ab&s;ence of Mon&s;ieur de St. Claire, the charms that her children's afforded; but hav|ing no real apology to offer, &s;he accept|ed the invitation, and the young people were delighted with the thoughts of ac|companying her. They had never &s;een their cou&s;ins, and promi&s;ed them&s;elves every gratification from the vi&s;it. But the family of Mon&s;ieur Duvernie was very different from that of Madame de St. Claire.

"And I," replied Madame de St. Claire, "have never yet found cau&s;e to be real|ly di&s;plea&s;ed with mine, longer than half an hour in my life. I have taught them to con&s;ider me as a friend, not as an au|&s;tere tyrannic parent.

<P>So are &s;ometimes whole families ruined, by the artful coun|&s;els of ill cho&s;en friends.

Thus, the love of play leads from one extremity to another, till poverty and ruin are the con&s;equence. At the age of ten years, you have, by not following my advice, made your&s;elf a bankrupt. So early led into the paths of error, what may I in future expect from a conduct &s;o reproachable?

<P>To teach your brother a le&s;&s;on, which I hope he will never forget. I ob&s;erved he di&s;played a particular attachment to Charles, who returned his attentions with real affec|tion. I, who knew his character, wi&s;h|ed to &s;hew my &s;on how unworthy he was

To cure him of this, I permitted him today to make choice of a playmate, almo&s;t a&s;&s;ured Ben&s;on would be the one he would like to invite.

<P>By this time, Henry and Ma&s;ter Du|vernie were returned from the &s;tables. "So," cried the latter, "here you are, ladies, in the little arbor where we left you." "Yes," replied his &s;i&s;ter, "and I believe it would have been better for you, had you remained here too, we have been mo&s;t delightfully entertain|ed." "So it &s;eems, or you would not have &s;taid here &s;o long&mdash;I fancy you for|get you have to dre&s;s for dinner." "In|deed I had not given it a thought," &s;aid Mi&s;s Duvernie; "but as it is &s;o late, I &s;uppo&s;e we mu&s;t go in, and make our|&s;elves as &s;mart as we can for your com|pany this afternoon. Though, I confe&s;s, I had rather &s;tay here and conver&s;e with my cou&s;ins." The young people then proceeded to the hou&s;e, which they had &s;carcely entered, before Mi&s;s Duvernie
<PB N="128" REF="036274_0268_10086B72727F2790">
exclaimed, "You mu&s;t come up with us, and &s;ee our wardrobe. We have &s;uch beautiful things! Clara and Emmiline were &s;urpri&s;ed to ob&s;erve the di&s;order of their cou&s;ins' drawers, for here nothing &s;eemed to be in its proper place, all was confu&s;ion; and half an hour was &s;pent in &s;earching for the dre&s;&s;es they propo&s;|ed to wear that day. Adelaide in mi&s;take had taken her &s;i&s;ter's necklace, and it was with difficulty Clara and Emmiline could prevent a &s;erious quarrel on the &s;ubject. In con&s;equence of this di&s;pute, the din|ner bell had rung before they were half ready to go down. And when the bu&s;|ine&s;s of the toilet was entirely complet|ed they dreaded to meet the angry eye of Mon&s;ieur Duvernie, a&s;&s;ured that their negligence would excite his di&s;plea&s;|ure. It did &s;o, and when the &s;ervants were withdrawn, their failings were enu|merated with increa&s;ing &s;everity, and little el&s;e was &s;poken of the remainder of the day. Clara and Emmiline, much as they were di&s;gu&s;ted with the conduct of
<PB N="129" REF="036274_0269_10086B74C1622040">
their cou&s;ins, pitied them on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, and did all in their power to re&s;tore that dome&s;tic harmony, which their incautious behavior had interrupt|ed. At a late hour, wearied with the numberle&s;s di&s;agreeables of the day, they retired to re&s;t, when Clara thus addre&s;&s;|ed her &s;i&s;ter: "How thankful ought we to be, my dear Emmiline, for the ble&s;&s;ings we po&s;&s;e&s;s in the be&s;t of parents; had our mother re&s;embled Madame Du|vernie, we &s;hould have been as mi&s;erable as Julia and Adelaide!"</P>

<P>WHILE the family were at breakfa&s;t the following morning, a letter was de|livered to Madame de St. Claire, which informed her, that Mon&s;ieur de St. Claire was within a few miles of the Chateau.</P>
<P>So great was the children's impatience to &s;ee their dear father again, that they

thought every moment an hour till the nece&s;&s;ary preparations could be made for their departure. The carriage was or|dered to be got ready as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and Madame with the &s;incere&s;t joy bade a ha&s;ty adieu to her unamiable friends; having a journey of &s;everal leagues to go before they could reach the Chateau. To make the time appear le&s;s tedious, Madame de St. Claire, at the children's reque&s;t, related the following little &s;tory of</P>

<HEAD>THE ORPHAN COTTAGERS.</HEAD>
<P>One clear wintry morning, the &s;pright|ly Juliana ran to her brother as &s;oon as &s;he was dre&s;&s;ed, rejoicing that the &s;now was all melted, and that &s;he &s;hould ob|tain permi&s;&s;ion of her mamma to take a long walk. The reque&s;t was no &s;ooner made, than granted by their indulgent parent, and they &s;et out; but had not walked more than two or three miles be|fore
<PB N="131" REF="036274_0271_10086B78905D6848">
Juliana, finding her&s;elf fatigued, was per&s;uaded by her brother to enter a &s;mall habitation which they ob&s;erved to the left at a little di&s;tance from the road. It was thatched, but in many places the tempe&s;t had torn away the &s;tubble, and left the roof expo&s;ed to all the inclemen|cy of the &s;ea&s;on; not a window remain|ed entire. "What a dwelling!" ex|claimed little George, as he rapped &s;oft|ly at the door! "oh! you, whoever you are, who inhabit this cottage, per|mit two children, worn out with fatigue, to re&s;t here a little while," Saying this, he rapped again, but nobody an&s;wered. The door was o'jar, and &s;eemed to invite the young travellers to enter; but what a &s;cene of mi&s;ery there pre&s;ented it&s;elf to their eyes! A beautiful girl on her knees, at the &s;ide of a bed of &s;traw, on which lay a young child, apparently not more than &s;ix years of age, groaning with angui&s;h; while the girl, rai&s;ing her eyes filled with tears, and her hands to Heav|en, exclaimed, with all the fervency of
<PB N="132" REF="036274_0272_10086B7BA60A1920">
heartfelt prayer, "Oh! Almighty God, merciful Father of the orphan, pre&s;erve, I be&s;eech Thee, this child&mdash;pre&s;erve my brother!"</P>
<P>She &s;topped. The pre&s;ence of the &s;trangers prevented her continuing. The tender heart of Juliana was already affected, and taking the hand of the poor girl, &s;he &s;aid, with a voice interrupted by &s;ighs, "Be comforted, your little brother will &s;oon be well again." The girl &s;hook her head, and looked on him as if every ray of hope had been long ex|tingui&s;hed. "But what is the matter with him?" continued Juliana, approach|ing the bed, "What is his di&s;order? why does he lie upon &s;traw? and why are his clothes &s;o ragged? Poor baby! He has not even a nightcap; and the high wind blows &s;o keen through the crevices in the wall, that when it is bad weather, the rain, I am &s;ure, mu&s;t fall upon his head."</P>
<P>"Oh! my dear Mi&s;s!" replied the unfortunate girl, "you are yet young,
<PB N="133" REF="036274_0273_10086B7DEFCCBD78">
and unacquainted with &s;uffering and &s;orrows. You a&s;k, why we lie upon &s;traw? why we are covered with rags? Know then, that we are poor! We are orphans! It is now &s;ix months &s;ince we lo&s;t our dear parents by a malignant fe|ver. During their life we had &s;ufficient for our &s;upport, for they were very in|du&s;trious. My father had a &s;mall pur&s;e almo&s;t filled with money, which he had earned by his labors; and he u&s;ed often to &s;ay it was for his dear children, but when he was ill, the phy&s;ician came al|mo&s;t every day, and I ob&s;erved his vi&s;its made al&s;o to my dear mother were paid from this; &s;o that at the death of my dear parents, which happened &s;hortly af|ter, there was only enough left to defray their funeral expences, and &s;upport my brother for &s;ome weeks in an illne&s;s which has continued &s;ince the mea&s;les. But it is now all gone. Four days &s;ince, I bought with our la&s;t &s;ixpence a little loaf for him. Alas! my dear brother!&mdash;He will die&mdash;for I have not the means
<PB N="134" REF="036274_0274_10086B7F70FBF678">
to pre&s;erve his life. I cannot labor in the fields at this &s;ea&s;on of the year to earn any thing, to procure him the mo&s;t tri|fling nouri&s;hment, and he mu&s;t peri&s;h with hunger." In pronouncing the&s;e words, &s;he threw her&s;elf upon the child, who embraced her with tran&s;port, and &s;aid in a feeble voice, "Do not be unea|&s;y, my dear &s;i&s;ter. When I &s;ee <HI>you</HI> cry&mdash;it makes me &s;uffer more."</P>
<P>"Amiable boy!" exclaimed George, (advancing towards the bed) "you &s;hall have my hat to defend your head from the wind, which blows in on this &s;ide. Though a fine morning, it is rather cold. I will leave you al&s;o my &s;pencer. There&mdash;I will lay it over your feet to keep them warm." "And I," interrupted Juliana, "will make you a pillow of my muff." "Dear generous children," &s;aid the poor Madelon, "is it po&s;&s;ible you can commi&s;erate thus our misfortunes? On my knees I thank you for all this good|ne&s;s. It is too much. You mu&s;t not leave with us your&mdash;" "My hat,"
<PB N="135" REF="036274_0275_100839A43433EC10">
cried George, "not even the king &s;hould remove from his head, or my &s;pencer from his feet. I can do without them. I have others at home, and &s;hould I be a little cold as we return, I &s;hall only expe|rience for one hour, what you and your brother have felt for days, weeks, and months. Poor creatures! what you mu&s;t have &s;uffered." "How I pity you, good girl!" &s;aid Juliana, "though I know not what it is to be poor; but it makes me cry to &s;ee you without fire, and almo&s;t naked, in this wretched hov|el. I had no idea there were &s;uch mi&s;er|able beings in the world." "There are but too many in &s;imilar &s;ituations I fear," replied the dejected Madelon. "And does nobody &s;eek them out," cried George; "I am &s;ure if I had known ye&s;terday you were &s;tarving with cold and hunger, I could not have &s;at peaceably at table, or enjoyed our com|fortable fire &s;ide." "We will tell mam|ma," re&s;umed Juliana, "that you are unhappy, that your little brother is per|i&s;hing.
<PB N="136" REF="036274_0276_10086B84104E1668">
She will permit us, I am &s;ure, to return and bring you all you are in want of, and medicines for the dear boy, that I hope will entirely recover him."</P>
<P>Juliana at this moment forgot that their hou&s;e was more than three miles off; for in taking leave of the cottagers, &s;he promi&s;ed to return in a quarter of an hour. But more than three quarters had elap&s;ed before they found them&s;elves at home, and in their mamma's pre&s;ence, who was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee her &s;on with|out his hat and &s;pencer; but this was &s;oon explained by the intere&s;ting hi&s;to|ry of the Orphan Cottagers. "Em|brace me, my dear children," &s;aid this affectionate mother, while the tears of compa&s;&s;ion &s;tole down her maternal cheek; "what plea&s;ure it gives me to &s;ee you can feel for tho&s;e misfortunes, which before this day you could not have formed to your&s;elves the &s;malle&s;t idea of!" "And are you willing, mamma," they demanded, "that we &s;hould return to the cottage?" "You can then,"
<PB N="137" REF="036274_0277_10086B87400C1D90">
&s;he replied, "relinqui&s;h without re|gret the plea&s;ures of the ball, to which you are engaged this evening? You know that today is the birthday of your little friend Eliza, who, perhaps, would think you unpolite, were you to di&s;ap|point her of your company."</P>
<P>The children looked &s;eriou&s;ly at each other. "Oh! we had forgot the ball!" "But," continued Juliana, "if I go, my dear mamma, to Eliza's, I &s;hall think all the time I am there of the troubles and the &s;ufferings of the&s;e poor orphans. Be|&s;ides, I cannot go&mdash;for I promi&s;ed to &s;ee them again in a quarter of an hour. Oh! indeed I cannot go to the ball. Send &s;ome apology, dear mamma, to my friend. I &s;hall feel more plea&s;ure in re|lieving the mi&s;ery of the&s;e poor chil|dren; you can have no idea of their &s;it|uation, or what I would not do to re|lieve it." "Nor I either," cried George; "let us return to &s;upply them with eve|ry thing that is nece&s;&s;ary." "My dear children," &s;he replied, "it is not my in|tention
<PB N="138" REF="036274_0278_10086B88C3398408">
to deprive you of the noble&s;t plea&s;ure the human heart is capable of enjoying. You need not prepare for the ball the&s;e two hours. In that inter|val, we can return to the cottagers. I will order the carriage, and accompany you. We will bring them with us. Here they &s;hall be taken care of, and every thing admini&s;tered that their wants require. What do you &s;ay to this, my little ones? Are you willing that the&s;e orphans &s;hould &s;hare with you the affec|tion of that mother who loves you &s;o tenderly?" "Oh! yes, dear mamma," replied immediately Juliana, "let us fetch them&mdash;let us fetch them: They are good, and worthy your protection. If you had &s;een the affection of poor Ma|delon for her parents, how &s;he wept when &s;he &s;poke of them, and her tender anxiety for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> little brother, you would never have forgotten it. She is &s;o pret|ty too&mdash;&s;o humble. Oh! I am &s;ure you will love her, and the little boy is &s;o pa|tient, we did not hear him utter a com|plaint
<PB N="139" REF="036274_0279_10086B8B0F664E78">
plaint all the while we were there. But here is the carriage. Oh! mamma, our dear mamma; you will al&s;o be a moth|er to the Orphan Cottagers!"</P>
<P>"Thank you, thank you, dear mam|ma," exclaimed Emmiline, "what a charming &s;tory! I am in love with the little Juliana, and the dear boy who left his hat and &s;pencer with the poor chil|dren. I will repeat their hi&s;tory to pa|pa. How much have we to &s;ay to him! Our good friend de Livr&eacute; too&mdash;how hap|py he will be to know &s;o worthy a man!"</P>
<P>It was late in the evening before the travellers arrived at the Chateau. Eve|ry heart palpitated with joy as they ap|proached the gates, about which the vil|lagers were a&s;&s;embled in crowds, and "Mon&s;ieur de St. Claire, our good ma&s;|ter, is returned!" was reechoed with ble&s;&s;ings from an hundred voices.</P>
<P>The reunion of the&s;e amiable partners in conjugal felicity was a &s;cene to which no pencil can do ju&s;tice, no pen de&s;cribe
<PB N="140" REF="036274_0280_10086B8E22CAAD60">
with &s;ufficient energy. Tho&s;e only who have known the plea&s;ure of meeting with all that is mo&s;t dear to them, after a long and painful &s;eparation, can form an idea of the happine&s;s of Madame de St. Claire and the joy of the Little Family.</P>
