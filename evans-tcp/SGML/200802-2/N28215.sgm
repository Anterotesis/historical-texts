<HEAD>A Di&s;cour&s;e, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>AGREEABLY to the recommendation of the great Council of our United States, &s;econded by that of the Sen|ate, and Repre&s;entatives of this Commonwealth, we are convened, this day, publicly <HI>to te&s;tify our grief "for the death of</HI> GENERAL GEORGE WASHINGTON," with decent formalities of mourning &s;uitable to the &s;or|rowful occa&s;ion, and expre&s;&s;ive of the honor and re&s;pect, due to the memory of &s;o illu&s;trious and worthy a per&s;on|age, and of tho&s;e &s;entiments, with which the mind of all ranks and orders of men among us, &s;eems to be &s;o deeply and extraordinarily affected.</P>
<P>As it has been reque&s;ted that a di&s;cour&s;e &s;uitable to the occa&s;ion be publicly delivered, the words of king David, &s;poken on an occa&s;ion &s;omewhat &s;imilar, occurred to mind as no improper motto. "KNOW YE NOT THAT THERE IS A PRINCE AND A GREAT MAN THIS DAY FALLEN IN ISRAEL?" 2 SAMUEL III. 38.</P>
<P>They were occa&s;ioned by the lamented death of Abner, the chief captain of the ho&s;t of I&s;rael; and, I think, they may be adopted by us at this time with great propriety. A great man indeed has fallen: yea, may we not &s;ay in &s;ober truth that a greater, than Abner, is this day fallen in our nation: An important pillar in our political build|ing
<PB N="4" REF="037605_0004_100EE8D29DBBADD8">
has given way, and &s;unk to the ground; and United America has very &s;en&s;ibly felt the &s;hock through its whole extent and trembles at the fall. Since the &s;un has &s;hone on the&s;e regions, a death &s;o lamented has never been known among us.</P>
<P>Had the coun&s;els and decrees of Heaven concurred with our wi&s;hes, this day had been celebrated, as former|ly, as a day of rejoicing, and grateful commemoration of the day, which, &s;ixty-eight years ago, gave birth to one, whom God rai&s;ed up to be a di&s;tingui&s;hed honor and ble&s;&s;ing to his country, and a great example to the world of tho&s;e virtues and other &s;hining accompli&s;hments, which give dignity to human nature. But the &s;overeign Di&s;po&s;er of all events has turned it into a day of mourning. THIS GREAT MAN IS FALLEN. Having &s;erved his generation by the will of God, he is gone the way of all the earth, and &s;leeps in the tomb, never to wake and ri&s;e again till the heavens are no more. And we join &s;incerely with our fellow citizens in expre&s;&s;ing our &s;orrowful re&s;ent|ments of the great lo&s;s the nation and the world have &s;u&s;tained, of the frown of heaven upon us, and al&s;o the great re&s;pect and veneration we have for one, who&s;e extra|ordinary talents, virtues, and achievments had been &s;o long, &s;o honorably, and &s;ucce&s;sfully di&s;played in the &s;ervice of his country in its highe&s;t offices and de|partments. We take up the lamentation of the mourning prophet, <Q>The joy of our heart is cea&s;ed; our dance is turned into mourning; the crown is fallen from our head; wo unto us that we have &s;inned.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="037605_0005_100EE8D4782A99E0">But let us mourn like chri&s;tians, with humble, patient, unrepining &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to God; who, though &s;urrounded with clouds and darkne&s;s, governs the world with perfect wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, and goodne&s;s. He gives, and he takes away, ble&s;&s;ed be his name; yet &s;entiments of &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion forbid us not to have, and decently expre&s;s the feelings of humanity. This we would now do, not in the wild effu&s;ions of pa&s;&s;ion, but by mode&s;t, &s;ober, unaffected tokens, and language of deep and &s;erious concern.</P>
<P>Without entering upon a detail of tho&s;e accompli&s;h|ments, which are requi&s;ite to form the character of a GREAT MAN, perhaps no man of the age, certainly no one in the&s;e parts of the world has a more univer&s;ally acknowledged right to a high rank among the mo&s;t illu&s;t|rious characters in the world, than he, who&s;e death we are now called to lament; who&s;e great abilities and virtues, were di&s;played in a &s;eries of heroic acts and achievements, which will doubtle&s;s immortalize his name. The pen of the hi&s;torian, will we tru&s;t, do ju&s;tice to his character, which has al&s;o been emblazoned in the many &s;plendid and eloquent panegyrics, which have been pronounced, throughout the United States, in honor to his memory. If it be expected that &s;omething be now &s;aid on this &s;ub|ject; yet, I know you do not expect that it will be done with that beauty and energy of thought and language, which others have exhibited. You know the Speaker has not talents for this, nor does his ambition prompt him to &s;o vain an attempt. But the honor he has for the name of the illu&s;trious WASHINGTON con&s;trains him to a|ri&s;e
<PB N="6" REF="037605_0006_100EE8D60814C190">
and call him ble&s;&s;ed. A heart impre&s;&s;ed with deep concern does not much regard ornaments. A mourning habit needs not &s;plendid embelli&s;hments; nor need a fu|neral di&s;cour&s;e affect to &s;hine in a fine dre&s;s.</P>
<P>External di&s;tinctions, indeed, of which many make much account, are but the trappings of greatne&s;s. The true dignity of man is to be e&s;timated from the accompli&s;h|ments of the mind and virtues of the heart, exerted for great, noble, and u&s;eful purpo&s;es. Our WASHINGTON, however, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in a high degree tho&s;e advantages, which outward di&s;tinction gives a man, in the eye of the world.</P>
<P>The family from which he de&s;cended was honorable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was born in We&s;tmoreland County in Virginia, in a pari&s;h, which beat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the name of his family.</NOTE>; but in no external re&s;pect was it more honorable than in having &s;o illu&s;trious a branch &s;pring from it. Be&s;ides po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing an affluent fortune, his per&s;onal accompli&s;hments were extraordinary. In his countenance, which &s;ome think is no &s;mall index of the mind, maje&s;ty and comeli|ne&s;s were, I am informed, admirably blended. It was very commanding, and engaging. Penetrating &s;agacity, con&s;cious integrity, and goodne&s;s were there &s;o lively expre&s;&s;ed, that it &s;eemed a mirror of tho&s;e qualities, which &s;trike the beholder with reverence and love.</P>
<P>But the accompli&s;hments, which are &s;eated in the mind and the inner man of the heart, and in which he had few equals, were an early pre&s;age of future greatne&s;s. So con&s;picuous were his talents for great public &s;ervices, that, when he was little more than twenty years old, he was, though &s;o young, employed to conduct an important
<PB N="7" REF="037605_0007_100EE8D7A2BAB388">
negotiation, and di&s;charged his tru&s;t with judgment and fidelity. At this early period he began to gather the lau|rels of military glory in the defence of his country. Holding a Major's commi&s;&s;ion in the army, he gained an advantage over a &s;uperior enemy; and afterward, when a colonel under the unfortunate Braddock, who not heark|ening to his advice, fell, and his army was defeated on the banks of Monongahela, our WASHINGTON was honor|ed as the in&s;trument, under <HI>God,</HI> of bringing off the &s;hatter|ed remains of that army; and it may not be unworthy of notice, that, in a public addre&s;s delivered about this time, he was &s;poken of, as one, who &s;eemed de&s;igned in provi|dence to be a Savior of his country; words, which have been verified in a more remarkable manner, than was probably thought of, at the time they were &s;poken.</P>
<P>When he had no longer occa&s;ion to employ his military talents in the &s;ervice of his country, he was a magi&s;trate of the county, a Judge of the Court, and a Member of the Legi&s;lative A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>But it was upon occa&s;ion of the di&s;putes between Bri|tain and its American colonies and the war, which was in con&s;equence of them, that his &s;uperior talents and heroic virtues were drawn forth and pre&s;ented to view in their full lu&s;tre. Then he entered on a new and &s;hining ca|reer of military glory. Having been cho&s;en a delegate to the Congre&s;s, which the breaking out of the war had called together, he was unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en chief commander of the American Army; and took a commi&s;&s;ion for the execution of this mo&s;t arduous and hazardous office, at the call of his country; and, in defence of its invaded rights and privileges, &s;hrunk not from &s;tanding foremo&s;t
<PB N="8" REF="037605_0008_100EE8D9D13F67C0">
in the po&s;t of danger and expo&s;ing his life and its deare&s;t intere&s;ts in the perilous conte&s;t. In the di&s;charge of this high tru&s;t for eight years, in which the difficulties, dangers, and hard&s;hips he endured were inconceivable by tho&s;e, who did not experience them, he di&s;played the abil|ities, wi&s;dom, unbroken fortitude, firm re&s;olution, incor|ruptible fidelity, and integrity of a great and accompli&s;h|ed Captain. Nor was his clemency and humanity to|wards enemies, when the fortune of war had put them in his power, le&s;s con&s;picuous than his courage and conduct in repelling their ho&s;tilities. Such was al&s;o his kindne&s;s and tenderne&s;s towards tho&s;e, whom he commanded, that he was revered and loved by them as a father. Though he was, it is &s;aid, one of great &s;en&s;ibility, as mo&s;t great men are, yet he had &s;uch uncommon government of him|&s;elf, that the very trying and provoking &s;cenes, with which he was often exerci&s;ed, very &s;eldom occa&s;ioned any vi&s;ible di&s;compo&s;ure of &s;pirits. An achievement truly heroic. "He that ruleth his &s;pirit is better than the mighty who taketh a city." And when by means of his valour and conduct, with that of the other brave officers, and &s;oldiers under him, the war was, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, brought to a happy and triumphant clo&s;e, and peace, liberty, and independence &s;ecured to United America, then, with a magnanimity and genero&s;ity &s;carce to be paralleled, he gave up his commi&s;&s;ion to the Congre&s;s, and fell into the rank again with private citizens, re&s;olutely refu&s;ing to re|ceive any compen&s;ation for the toils and dangers of eight years &s;pent in the &s;ervice of his country, except what &s;hould accrue to him from the applau&s;es of his own con|&s;cience,
<PB N="9" REF="037605_0009_100EE8DBA0B52370">
from &s;eeing his fellow citizens enjoy the fruits of his toils and travail, exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;&s;ing their high grateful &s;en&s;e of his &s;ervices, and from the hope "that God would think on him for good according to all that he had done for his people." We may &s;ay, as Mr. Jeffer&s;on &s;aid &s;everal years ago, <Q>in war we have produced a WASHINGTON, who&s;e memory will be adored, while liberty &s;hall have votaries; who&s;e name will triumph over time, and will in future ages a&s;&s;ume its ju&s;t rank among the mo&s;t cele|brated worthies of the world.</Q></P>
<P>But it was not long before he was again called forth, from the &s;hades of his retirement, for further &s;ervices of the highe&s;t importance. The independency of the Ame|rican States being gained and recogni&s;ed, it was &s;oon found nece&s;&s;ary that a more &s;trong and energetic form of government be e&s;tabli&s;hed, which &s;hould embrace, and be a firm band of union to the whole &s;y&s;tem of American States. To form this a convention was appointed, to be compo&s;ed of men of approved wi&s;dom and virtue, delega|ted from the &s;everal parts of the union. To this con|vention, WASHINGTON was delegated; and unani|mou&s;ly cho&s;en Pre&s;ident of that venerable council of &s;ages, by whom our excellent federal con&s;titution was framed, which has been highly approved by the mo&s;t eminent civilians, and of which we have experienced the happy ef|fects equal to our mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes.</P>
<P>When this con&s;titution, in the framing of which he had borne &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed a part, having been accepted by the people, came to be organized; by the unanimous votes
<PB N="10" REF="037605_0010_100EE8DD2A9FE168">
of the electors he was once, and again cho&s;en to the highe&s;t place of honor and authority; and a&s;cended to it with the univer&s;al acclamations of all ranks and orders of the people. And his admini&s;tration realized the exalted hopes and expectations, which his abilities and virtues had rai&s;ed. And the Pre&s;ident appeared in the cabinet with the dig|nity of a great and accompli&s;hed &s;tate&s;man, not inferior to the general in his military line.</P>
<P>After &s;ixteen years had been devoted to the &s;ervice of his country, under the heavy burdens with which its highe&s;t and mo&s;t arduous offices were loaded, he re&s;igned the reins of civil government, as he had before re&s;igned his military commi&s;&s;ion. It would have been agreeable to the general wi&s;h of the people, if they could have longer enjoyed the advantages of his wi&s;e and faithful admini&s;tra|tion; and he would doubtle&s;s have had another unani|mous election, had not his advanced age craved repo&s;e from the cares and toils of office, &s;o &s;trongly, that he ex|cu&s;ed him&s;elf from &s;tanding candidate for it.</P>
<P>But when his country's wrongs and grievances, of which no redre&s;s could be obtained by peaceable negociation, called to arms, and he perceived that the public eye was looking up to him for his help, he immediately complied with the unexpected call, and took upon him the com|mand of the army to be rai&s;ed for the defence of the na|tion. And had his life been prolonged, in the pre&s;ent critical &s;ituation of affairs, we &s;hould have hoped for im|portant advantages from his wi&s;dom and influence.&mdash; But the&s;e hopes have now vani&s;hed with his expiring
<PB N="11" REF="037605_0011_100EE8DF227A4B40">
breath. WASHINGTON, who&s;e life, from his early youth to hoary age, has been &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed in the &s;ervice of his country, as to gain him the title of the SAVIOUR AND FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY, is taken from us, and that at a time when his &s;ervices &s;eem to be peculiarly wanted. His breath is gone forth, and, in that very day, his thoughts and cares for us are all peri&s;h|ed.</P>
<P>Before we fini&s;h this &s;ketch, it mu&s;t not be omitted that he was a &s;erious profe&s;&s;or of the chri&s;tian religion,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is &s;aid that while he commanded the army it was his daily practice, like Col. Gardiner, to devote an hour to private religious exerci&s;es.</NOTE> and held in utter abhorrence the principles of that vile, athei&s;tical, Epicurian Philo&s;ophy, which has corrupted the minds and morals of &s;o many, and produced incalculable mi&s;chief in the world.</P>
<P>You are &s;en&s;ible that what has been &s;aid concerning this great man, who&s;e fall occa&s;ions a general mourning, cannot be from a per&s;onal knowledge, but from &s;uch credible information as one in the&s;e di&s;tant parts, and &s;o low a &s;tation, has had acce&s;s to; I think nothing has been &s;aid but what is con&s;i&s;tent with truth. And more might have been &s;aid, with equal ju&s;tice, re&s;pecting his mo&s;t amiable and exemplary deportment, in the private walks of life; &s;uch was the man to the honor of who&s;e mem|ory the &s;olemnities of this day are ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>The&s;e honors we are all &s;en&s;ible can add nothing to him. And the chief view, we are to have in commemo|rating the&s;e things, is (be&s;ides expre&s;&s;ing due re&s;pect to
<PB N="12" REF="037605_0012_100EE8E186BA9478">
the memory of one, who has &s;erved his generation with &s;o much fidelity and &s;ucce&s;s) to give God the glory that is due to his name, who rai&s;ed up and formed this his &s;er|vant to be a fit in&s;trument, in his hand, to accompli&s;h the great things, which he has done for us. Far be it from us to give that honor to any creature, however dignified, which is due to God alone, of whom, through whom, and to whom are all things.</P>
<P>Are we not loudly called, this day, to humble our&s;elves under his hand, who has &s;o &s;orely &s;mitten and wounded us, and made &s;o great a breach upon us? When a great man falls, of whom it may be &s;aid, as was &s;aid to David, "Thou art better than ten thou&s;ands of us," who&s;e great wi&s;dom and influence, were likely to guide, unite, and an|imate a people in pur&s;uing tho&s;e mea&s;ures, which would promote their true intere&s;t more, than could be expected from myriads of ordinary men, the quenching of &s;uch a light ought to be con&s;idered as an alarming frown of Prov|idence. It darkens our day; and all who are wi&s;e to di&s;cern the &s;igns of the times &s;hould lay it to heart with &s;uitable concern. <Q>The Lord hath taken away the mighty man, the man of war, the judge, the prudent man, the antient, the captain of thou&s;ands, the honor|able man, the coun&s;ellor, and the eloquent orator. Help Lord for the faithful fail.</Q></P>
<P>Should we not then humbly enquire wherefore our God is contending with us; our &s;ins doubtle&s;s are the procur|ing cau&s;e of our calamities; &s;hall there be evil in the city and the Lord hath not done it? And is it not our ini|quities
<PB N="13" REF="037605_0013_100EE8E31116BD98">
which cau&s;e him to hide his face from us? Among numberle&s;s other provocations of divine di&s;plea&s;ure, which are too vi&s;ible among us, have we not abu&s;ed our pro&s;|perity, as an encouragement to a pre&s;umptuous &s;ecurity, and in&s;en&s;ibility of our dependence on God? We then need not wonder if he frown upon us. When the P&s;alm|i&s;t &s;aid, in his pro&s;perity, that he &s;hould never be moved, but that his mountain &s;tood &s;trong, it immediately follows, "Thou did&s;t hide thy face, and I was troubled." Again have we not been too ready to tru&s;t in man and make fle&s;h our arm? and when our undertakings have had &s;uc|ce&s;s, have we not &s;acrificed to our net, and burnt incen&s;e to our own drag, giving that honour to the in&s;truments, which is due only to the &s;upreme agent? We do well to honor tho&s;e, on whom God puts di&s;tingui&s;hing honor, endowing them with &s;uperior gifts and virtues, and mak|ing them guardian angels of a nation; as &s;uch, we honor the memory of that GREAT MAN, who&s;e fall we la|ment. But God forbid that we &s;hould make an idol of any creature, our God is a jealous God. If we give his glory to another, we provoke his jealou&s;y to take away our idol, and &s;hew us that tho&s;e, whom we adore as Gods, mu&s;t die like men. <Q>All fle&s;h is as gra&s;s and all glory of man as the fading flower of the field. Let not the wi&s;e man glory in his wi&s;dom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his rich|es. Surely man in his be&s;t e&s;tate is altogether vanity.</Q></P>
<P>Of this we have lately had awakening and repeated admonitions. We had &s;carce put off our mourning for our excellent governor,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His Excellency Increa&s;e Sumner E&s;q&punc;</NOTE> when the fall of a greater man renews
<PB N="14" REF="037605_0014_100EE8E49C440DB0">
our grief; and we have the more rea&s;on to be alarmed, at the&s;e &s;ad vi&s;itations, when &s;uch men are taken away at &s;uch a time as this, when our pro&s;pects are darkened by tho&s;e clouds, which with portentous a&s;pect have been gathering ove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> us; and the &s;etting of &s;uch luminaries mu&s;t increa&s;e the darkne&s;s. God grant that it be not a pre&s;age of further calamities.</P>
<P>How are all the glories of this world eclip&s;ed by the mortality of the greate&s;t men! In what a &s;triking light mu&s;t their folly appear who &s;et their affections and found their hopes on things, which are &s;o &s;oon to fade and utter|ly fail! And what contempt has God poured upon the grandeur and glitter of wordly honor and riches, not on|ly by &s;oon &s;tripping the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of all this fal&s;e glory, but al&s;o by often be&s;towing it on the ba&s;e&s;t of men, and &s;o as it were expo&s;ing it to open &s;hame. But though the wicked are &s;ometimes exalted to the &s;ummit of earthly greatne&s;s, their triumphing is &s;hort. Their end is fa&s;t ap|proaching. Death will &s;oon lay all their glory in the du&s;t; and how great will be their fall! The wicked are driven away in their wickedne&s;s, and their name &s;hall rot. But the righteous hath hope in his death; his end is peace; his memory is ble&s;&s;ed; He &s;hall be had in ever|la&s;ting remembrance.</P>
<P>Such was his end, for who&s;e death a nation mourns, and who&s;e name is honored as the friend of man, the patron and defender of the liberties and rights of his country. He received the &s;udden &s;ummons with a mind rai&s;ed a|bove fear. "I am not afraid to die," &s;aid he, with his
<PB N="15" REF="037605_0015_100EE8E714D96ED0">
expiring breath, and then clo&s;ing his eyes and mouth, with his own hands, clo&s;ed a u&s;eful and glorious life with that &s;erenity of mind, and compo&s;ure of countenance, for which he had been &s;o remarkable while pa&s;&s;ing through the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive and changing &s;cenes of his life.</P>
<Q><L>With growing dignity behold him ri&s;e,</L>
<L>Great while he lives, but greater when he dies.</L></Q>
<P>The &s;olemnities of this day, I have &s;aid, can add nothing to the dead; but, by a wi&s;e improvement, they may be profitable to us; and our coming together in this hou&s;e, which is become a hou&s;e of mourning, may be better than to go to the hou&s;e of fea&s;ting. For this end we &s;hould not only contemplate with due honor the characters of tho&s;e, who have &s;hone with di&s;tingui&s;hed lu&s;tre, as public benefactors, but a noble emulation &s;hould be enkindled within us to imitate their virtues. It was not merely po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing great talents that made GENERAL WASH|INGTON &s;o much greater than others, but it was his improving them &s;o eminently for the good of mankind. Let us go and do likewi&s;e; though we expect not to ri&s;e to the height of his greatne&s;s, yet let us endeavour in our narrower &s;phere to &s;erve God and our generation with dil|igence and fidelity. To him, who improves well what he hath, more &s;hall be given, and though his beginning were &s;mall, his latter end may greatly increa&s;e.</P>
<P>When we &s;ee that the life of the greate&s;t, the mo&s;t honorable, and u&s;eful men is but a vapour, like that of others, which &s;oon vani&s;hes away, &s;ometimes when we mo&s;t need the benefit of their talents, virtues, and influ|ence,

we are loudly admoni&s;hed not to put our tru&s;t in any of the &s;ons of men. They who &s;eem mo&s;t worthy of our confidence may, we find, break like reeds when we lean upon them, and pierce our hearts with &s;orrow and di&s;appointment. God is our only &s;ure refuge, and pre|&s;ent help, in time of trouble. His name is a &s;trong tow|er to which we may fly and be &s;afe. Under his protection we may hope to e&s;cape tho&s;e evils, of which we &s;eem to have rea&s;on to be apprehen&s;ive, in con&s;equence of the breaches he has made upon us. We &s;hall not &s;uffer &s;hip|wreck, if God takes our helm to &s;teer us &s;afe through the rocks of danger, though the under pilots of the &s;tate &s;hould be wa&s;hed overboard and drowned in the mo&s;t dangerous and tempe&s;tuous &s;ea&s;on, the &s;tormy wind is obedient to him, and will fulfil his word. Though WASHINGTON is dead, GOD lives and reigns, the king eternal and im|mortal. Let the earth rejoice, clouds and darkne&s;s are round about him, but righteou&s;ne&s;s and judgment are the habitation of his throne. Alleluia for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth; and if we &s;eek him he will be found of us. He is with us while we are with him. This God will then be our God forever and ever. Happy is the people that is in &s;uch a ca&s;e, yea happy is the people who&s;e God is the Lord.</P>
