<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear brethren and friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AT length, after a long and unexpected delay, I offer to your peru&s;al a few &s;ermons which I promi&s;ed the public &s;ome years ago; all which &s;ome or other of you heard, and in which you are all concerned.</P>
<P>It is not material to tell you, on what account I have laid by &s;ome, which I had tran&s;cribed for your &s;ervice, and which you probably expected to have &s;een with the&s;e. I have &s;ub&s;tituted in their room &s;uch, as I thought might, by the divine ble&s;&s;|ing, be mo&s;t u&s;eful to you.</P>
<P>I hope you will peru&s;e them with candour; and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, con&s;idering they were prepared for the pre&s;s chiefly in &s;ome broken moments, while I was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, journeys, or &s;ome fragments of time at home, often taken from my &s;leep, as the &s;tated duties of my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">lling require an attendance, which will not allow of any long interruption. You would readi|ly excu&s;e what defects you may di&s;cover in them. If you knew that tender concern for you pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> and future happine&s;s, by which every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> page has been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.

great difficulty, that I forbear inlarging, more than the proper limits of &s;uch an addre&s;s would admit.</P>
<P>As for you: my Leice&s;ter&s;hire friends, among&s;t whom my mini&s;try was opened, and the fir&s;t years of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> were delightfully &s;pent, I cannot forget, and I hope you have not forgotten, that intimate and plea&s;ing friend&s;hip, with which we were once almo&s;t daily conver&s;ing; the &s;weet coun&s;el we have often taken together in private, as well as the plea&s;ure with which we have gone to the hou&s;e of God in company. All the&s;e &s;ermons, but the &s;econd and fifth of them, were fir&s;t drawn up for your &s;ervice, and preached to you; and much of that tender|ne&s;s for you, which gave birth to them, has been ri|&s;ing fre&s;h in my mind, while I have been taking this review of them. I hope they were not then like wa|ter unprofitably &s;pilt on the ground, and that the pe|ru&s;al of them may revive impre&s;&s;ions made by the fir&s;t hearing. Intermediate years have introduced new &s;cenes; and &s;ome of us who were then in the morn|ing of life, are now ri&s;en up to the meridian of it. Providence has conducted many of you into new relations; and it is my plea&s;ure to ob&s;erve, in how honourable and how u&s;eful a manner &s;everal of you are filling them up with their proper duties.</P>
<P>While you are your&s;elves in&s;tances of the hap|py con&s;equences, which attend a religio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s educati|on, I hope you will be &s;ingularly careful, that your decendents may &s;hare in the like advantages; and I &s;hall heart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ly rejoice, if tho&s;e &s;ermons, or tho&s;e I have formerly publi&s;hed, may be of any a&s;&s;i&s;tance to you in the&s;e pious cares. God has put an ear|ly period to the lives of &s;ome, who, when I was among&s;t you, were the growing hopes of the re&s;pec|tive congregations to which they belonged. Seve|ral of them have died while the&s;e &s;ermons were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. May the thought quicken you in the improvement of &s;o uncertain a life; and may
<PB N="v" REF="046736_0004_1021EF4235CB3998">
divine grace render &s;ome things, peculiarly intend|ed for the u&s;e of tho&s;e who are now beyond the reach of &s;uch an addre&s;s, &s;erviceable to others, in|to who&s;e hands they may fall!</P>
<P>Though I am providentially &s;eparated from you, may I &s;till hear that you walk worthy of the Lord; and may every advancing year, and revolving day of life, ripen us more for that happine&s;s, which we hope 'ere long to &s;hare with each other, in the hou&s;e of our heavenly father!</P>
<P>If any of you, who were once my care and my hope, have now for&s;aken the ways and the God of your fathers, and turned a&s;ide to the paths of li|centiou&s;ne&s;s and folly, I now repeat the admoniti|ons which I have formerly given you, that the&s;e things will, to you, above all others, be bitterne&s;s in the end. And I intreat you, that if you have any little regard &s;till remaining, for one to whom &s;ome of you have profe&s;&s;ed not a little, you would at lea&s;t attentively peru&s;e the &s;ixth of the&s;e di&s;|cour&s;es, as containing reflections, which mu&s;t &s;oon|er or later, pierce your hearts, with penitential re|mor&s;e, or overla&s;ting de&s;pair. Oh, that divine grace might concur with it to prevent your ruin, and might give me to &s;ee you as wife, as religious, and as happy, as tho&s;e excellent parents once wi&s;h|ed you, who&s;e eyes are now clo&s;ed in the du&s;t; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> precepts and examples, charges and tears, yea &s;eem long &s;ince to have forgot!</P>
<P>As for you, my dear friends here at home, I have the plea&s;ure of conver&s;ing &s;o often with you, that it is the le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary now to addre&s;s you at large. Yet it is but ju&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ice to you thus publickly to de|clare, that, amid&s;t all that goodne&s;s and mercy, which has followed me all my days, there is no pro|vidence, which I more gratefully own, than that which brought me hither&punc; nor does any thing con|tribute more to make my mini&s;try here comforta|ble,
<PB N="vi" REF="046736_0005_1021EF4427878990">
than the Spirit of &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, which di&s;covers it&s;elf in many young per&s;ons among&s;t us. Oh, that it were as univer&s;al, as in &s;ome it is amiable and ex|emplary! Permit me to remind you, that, as your remarkable importunity was the con&s;ideration, which turned the &s;cales for my coming hither, af|ter they had long hovered in uncertainty, &s;o you are under &s;ome peculiar obligations to &s;tudy the ea&s;e and comfort of my life, which you can never &s;o effectually &s;ecure, as by the holy regularity of your own. Our aged friends are dropping away apace; nay, the graves have &s;wallowed up many, very many of your own age, who, but a few months ago, promi&s;ed long and exten&s;ive u&s;efulne&s;s here. It is you that are to comfort me under the&s;e &s;or|rows. I can &s;olemnly &s;ay, that I had much rather be numbered among&s;t them, than live to &s;ee the glory of practical religion lo&s;t in this &s;ociety, while it is under my care. Remember, that, under God, you are its &s;upport; and remember, that the high hopes you have given me, would make a di&s;appointment &s;it &s;o much the heavier upon my heart.</P>
<P>But I will not conclude with any thing &s;o un|comfortable, as the mention of a di&s;appointment from you; but rather with recommending you, and tho&s;e to whom I have formerly &s;tood in the like re|lation, to the care of Chri&s;t, the great &s;hepherd of the &s;heep, and to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of that gracious &s;pirit, who can cau&s;e you to grow in knowledge and piety like the gra&s;s, and like willows by the water|cour&s;es. I hope you will not forget to pray for all that appear concerned for your &s;piritual edification and eternal happine&s;s, and more e&s;pecially for</P>

<Q><HI>A &s;eed &s;hall &s;erve him, it &s;hall be accounted to the Lord for a generation: they &s;hall come, and &s;hall declare his righteou&s;ne&s;s unto a people that &s;hall be born, that he hath done this.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is a very beautiful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> ancient Jewi&s;h writer,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;. xiv.18.</NOTE> which has its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> among&s;t &s;ome of the fine&s;t of the Heathen Poets<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">er.

VI.</NOTE>, that <Q>as of the green leaves on a thick tree, &s;ome fall, and others grow; &s;o of the generations of fle&s;h and blood, one cometh to an end, and another is born.</Q> In this re&s;pect the re&s;emblance is obvious; but there is another, in which it will not always &s;o evidently hold. We perceive not any remarkable difference between the leaves of one year, and of another: they which open at the return of the Spring, are com|monly as large and fair as tho&s;e which the preced|ing

<P>THESE complaints and fore-bodings have been borrowed by every age &s;ince they were publi&s;hed, and are to this day borrowed by us, as what we ima|gine more applicable to our&s;elves than to tho&s;e who wrote them, or to any who have already <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> them. I will not &s;ay, there is univer&s;al cau&s;e for &s;uch an application; but I am &s;ure, the face of af|fairs in many families, and, may I not add, in many churches too, is abundantly &s;ufficient not only to excu&s;e, but to vindicate it.</P>
<P>IN the mid&s;t of this mournful &s;urvey, the heart of every pious I&s;raelite will tremble for the A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">k of the Lord, and he will be ready to &s;ay, perhaps with

Surely God will utterly abandon tho&s;e who &s;o ba&s;ely de&s;ert him in contempt of the cleared revelation of his go&s;pel, and the mo&s;t engaging <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> awakening calls of his providence.

<P>Now there &s;eems to be &s;omething in the very &s;ound of the text which may relieve our minds un|der the&s;e gloomy apprehen&s;ions. A &s;eed &s;hall &s;erve him, it &s;hall be accounted to the Lord for a genera|tion: they &s;hall come, and declare his name to a third &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; a people who &s;hall be born of them. Here is an evident promi&s;e or prediction, that the knowledge and the fear of God &s;hould be propa|gated from one age and generation to another: and this mu&s;t be an agreeable a&s;&s;urance, whatever the particular occa&s;ion were on which it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">. Were this P&s;alm to be con&s;idered only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> the calamities of David, and the wonderful deliver|ance which God wrought out for him the words be|fore us might be improved for our own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> on the ju&s;te&s;t principles of analogy: for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;alvation granted to him were to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o deep and &s;o la&s;ting an impre&s;&s;ion on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">, and o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> future ages, how rea&s;onably, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> be expected from that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> and exten&s;ive &s;alvation, which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> in the everla&s;ting go&s;pel?</P>

We dwell in a country, which, with re|gard to Judea, lay at the ends of the earth, and which was long over-run with barbarity and idolatry yet we are now in&s;tructed in the knowledge of the God of I&s;rael, and are this day a&s;&s;embled for his wor&s;hip; &s;o that at the di&s;tance of more than two thou&s;and years from the publication of this pre|diction, we are the living witne&s;&s;es of its truth; be|ing

I. NOTHING can be of greater importance, with regard to your&s;elves, than your being early en|gaged in the &s;ervice of God.</P>
<P>IT is a con&s;ideration, which equally concerns you, and others of a more advanced age, that religion is, generally &s;peaking, the &s;ure&s;t way we can take to be happy in this world, and, through the merits and righteou&s;ne&s;s of a Redeemer, the only way to glory in another; &s;o that, as the apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;es it, god|line&s;s is profitable unto all things, having promi&s;e of the life that now is, and of that which is to come<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iv. 8.</NOTE></P>
<P>ITS tendency to promote our pre&s;ent comfort and happine&s;s, will abundantly appear from the in|fluence which it has on our external circum&s;tances, and on the temper of our minds. As to the former of the&s;e, I might enlarge on its beneficial effects, with regard to health and reputation, e&s;tate and friend&s;hip: and as to the latter, nothing is more ob|vious than that it tends to &s;ecure the tranquillity and the plea&s;ure of the &s;oul, as it either &s;uppre&s;&s;es or moderates, tho&s;e turbulent pa&s;&s;ions which throw it into angui&s;h and confu&s;ion, while it gives abundant exerci&s;e to tho&s;e which are mo&s;t &s;weet and delight|ful. Such is the immediate ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of the man who feareth the Lord, and delighteth greatly in his commandments<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. cxii. 1</NOTE>. And who&s;oever reflects on the evidence with which each of the&s;e particulars is attended, mu&s;t acknowledge, that the ways of wi&s;|dom are ways of plea&s;antne&s;s, and all her paths are peace<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Prov. iii. 17.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To complete the argument, it is to be con&s;idered, that the&s;e plea&s;ant and peaceful paths lead up to the paradi&s;e of God: for invariable truth and good|ne&s;s has engaged, that to them who by patient con|tinuance

in well doing, &s;eek for glory, honour and immortality, he will render eternal life<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Rom. ii. 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, if you go on in the neglect of God and religion, it is very po&s;&s;ible you may be un|done for this world, as thou&s;ands have been, by de|bauchery and folly: or, under &s;ome re&s;traints of common prudence, which may &s;ecure you from that, if you do not violently over bear the voice of con|&s;cience, it will often di&s;quiet and torment you by its remon&s;trances and expo&s;tulations; till in a little time death will remove you to the &s;eats of horror, where the worm never dies, and the fire is never quenched<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Mark ix. 44.</NOTE>. For God has &s;olemnly declared, that he will render indignation and wrath, tribula|tion and angui&s;h, to every &s;oul of man that doeth evil<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Rom. ii. 8, 9.</NOTE>; when the Lord Je&s;us is revealed from heaven in flaming fire, taking vengeance on tho&s;e that know not God, and obey not the go&s;|pel<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">2 The&s;. i. 7, 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ARE not the younge&s;t of you concerned in &s;uch declarations as the&s;e? And if you are, let con|&s;cience &s;ay, whether you are to be de&s;pi&s;ed? It evidently appears, the que&s;tion is this: &s;hall you &s;pend your days upon earth like rational creatures, in the noble&s;t enjoyment of God, and of your&s;elves, till you ri&s;e to the glories and plea&s;ures of the heavenly world? Or &s;hall you live like idiots and like brutes, in the amu&s;ements of a vain imagination, and the indulgence of the meane&s;t appetites, till you &s;ink for ever under all the &s;hame and remor&s;e of a polluted guilty mind, and the almighty vengeance of an incen&s;ed God? And can you be &s;o &s;tupid as to imagine this que&s;tion will bear a debate, or that any of the little intere&s;ts of time and &s;en&s;e are to be re|garded, while the&s;e things are forgotten?

<P>1. THE happine&s;s of all who conver&s;e with you will be con&s;iderably influenced by your charac|ter and behaviour.</P>
<P>THEY who have any &s;en&s;e of religion them&s;elves will be tenderly concerned for your happine&s;s.

IF you be early delivered into the mould of the go&s;pel, you will quickly learn you were not born for your&s;elves.

THUS u&s;eful might you be in your earlie&s;t years, and as you were advancing in age and experience, your u&s;efulne&s;s might be daily increa&s;ing; and if God &s;hould &s;pare you to the decline of life, you might bring forth much nobler fruits in old age, than you could have done, if your entrance on a religious life had been deferred to that un&s;ea&s;onable time.</P>
<P>THUS may the whole period of your life be fil|led up with eminent &s;ervice. And I will add, that your beneficial influence may extend far be|yond the circle of your per&s;onal conver&s;e: you may be ble&s;&s;ings to your country, indeed to the whole world, by drawing down the favour of God upon it, in part, as a crown of your piety, and an an&s;wer to your prayers. But,</P>
<P>On the contrary, if you neglect religion, you will deprive the world of all tho&s;e benefits, which it may otherwi&s;e expect from you. If you are natu|rally covetous, you will probably indulge that un|worthy temper, &s;o as to with-hold relief from tho&s;e to whom it is mo&s;t ju&s;tly due&punc; or if you be of a liberal di&s;po&s;ition, your genero&s;ity will degenerate into prodigality; or perhaps you will &s;quander away &s;o much of your e&s;tates in vanity and de|bauchery, as to throw your&s;elves out of a capaci|ty of a&s;&s;i&s;ting tho&s;e whom you mo&s;t &s;incerely pity, and would gladly relieve.

<P>NOR is this the wor&s;t; for, as hardly any are mere cyphers in life, it is much to be feared, that in&s;tead of ble&s;&s;ings, you may prove mi&s;chiefs to the world.

In&s;tead of re&s;toring and reclaiming the &s;ouls of your com|panions, you may pervert and de&s;troy them by &s;inful di&s;cour&s;es and impious examples. Thus you may draw down the vengeance of God on the places where you live, and provoke him to &s;end &s;ome pub|lic calamity, as a puni&s;hment, for that univer&s;al de|generacy which you have abetted. So that, (to clo&s;e the melancholy &s;cene) at the bar of God, and in the &s;eats of torment, you may meet with multi|tudes of unhappy creatures, who will cry out on you, as the fatal cau&s;e of their ruin in this world, and their condemnation in that.</P>
<P>BY &s;uch a variety of arguments does it appear, that the happine&s;s of tho&s;e you conver&s;e with will be con&s;iderably influenced by your temper and con|duct.

<P N="2">2. THE comfort and happine&s;s of your religious parents does, in a great mea&s;ure, depend on your &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and piety.</P>
<P>WHAT I have ju&s;t been &s;aying on the former heads, will evidently prove the truth of this ob&s;er|vation. Your pious parents have a generous con|cern for the happine&s;s of others, and this will en|gage them earne&s;tly to wi&s;h, that you may be ble&s;|&s;ings, and not cur&s;es to the world about you.

<P>IF they &s;ee you under the influences of early pi|ety, unknown plea&s;ure will ari&s;e in their minds: they will rejoice in it, not merely as it will be a &s;e|curity to them of a re&s;pectful and grateful treat|ment from you; but as it will, through grace, &s;e|cure

<P>THESE reflections will give them inexpre&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure in a variety of circum&s;tances. Their daily conver&s;e with you will be more agreeable to them, than it could otherwi&s;e be, when they di&s;cern the lively impre&s;&s;ions of religion upon your &s;pirits, and perceive that you have a reli&s;h for tho&s;e truths and promi&s;es of the go&s;pel, which are their joy and &s;ong in the hou&s;e of their pilgrimage<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. cxix. 54.</NOTE>.

And when they have rea|&s;on to apprehend that you are retired for the duties of the clo&s;et, it will chear their hearts to think, <Q>Now is my child with his heavenly Father.

And I hope, God is &s;miling upon him, and teaching him, by happy experience, that tho&s;e pi|ous labours are not in vain.</Q></P>
<P>WITH &s;uch con&s;olations will their hearts be &s;up|ported in all the occurrences, which providence may allot either to you, or them.

Or, if they can give you but little, this thought will relieve them, that they commend you to the care of a guardian and a father, who is able abundantly to &s;upply your nece&s;&s;ities, and who has engaged, by the promi&s;es of his covenant, that tho&s;e who fear him &s;hall want no good thing<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xxxiv. 9. lxxxiv. 11.</NOTE>. They will have the plea&s;ure to think, that, how low &s;oever your outward condition may be, you will be rich in grace, and in the entertainments of religion now, and in the glories of the heavenly inheritance at la&s;t.

It will revive their hearts in their dy|ing moments to think, that when they are &s;leeping in the du&s;t, you will &s;tand up in their places, and &s;upport the intere&s;t of God in the world, with a fi|delity and zeal perhaps &s;uperior to theirs.

BY &s;uch a variety of con&s;iderations does it ap|pear, that the comfort and happine&s;s of your pious parents does very much depend upon your temper and behaviour.

<P>AND let me intreat you, my friends, to reflect for a few moments on the weight of the argument, that you may judge whether it will not bear all the &s;tre&s;s which Solomon lays upon it. The hap|pine&s;s of your parents is in que&s;tion; and can you &s;light that? Con&s;ider how much you owe to your parents, as they were the in&s;truments of your be|ing, and have been, under God the principal &s;up|port of it. Think of the tenderne&s;s with which they watched around your cradles, and of the ma|ny kind offices which they performed for you in your helple&s;s infancy; which parental tenderne&s;s made delightful to them, when hardly any thing el&s;e could have made them tolerable. Think how liberally they have long contributed towards the &s;upply of your wants; and in how many in&s;tances they have denied them&s;elves, that they might gra|tify you. Think how they have rejoiced with you in your joys, and mourned with you in your &s;orrows; how they have been terrified at your re|al dangers; and perhaps often di&s;quieted with tho&s;e timorous apprehen&s;ions, which fondne&s;s, rather than rea&s;on, has &s;ugge&s;ted to them. And under the im|pre&s;&s;ion of the&s;e reflections, &s;ay, whether it may not rea&s;onably be expected, that you &s;hould have a mo&s;t affectionate regard to their repo&s;e and com|fort, and think with horror of becoming their grief and torment.</P>
<P>I MAY add, that as the parents of &s;ome among&s;t you are declining under the infirmities of age, and on that account the objects of a re&s;pectful compa&s;|&s;ion to all, they &s;hould be &s;o e&s;pecially to you who

Many of them are the ornaments and glory of our a&s;&s;em|blies, and the mo&s;t dear and intimate of our friends; we are obliged therefore to take part with them in their &s;orrows and their joys, with relation to you their children, It mu&s;t &s;en&s;ibly afflict us to &s;ee, that while their wi&s;dom and their piety might command the reverence and the love of all that know them, enemies &s;hould ari&s;e up again&s;t them out of their own hou&s;es, and even the children of

<P>WELL might it grieve us to be thus left alone in the mid&s;t of a degenerate world; e&s;pecially when we reflect, that the cau&s;e of God was &s;ink|ing in the time of our admini&s;tration, and &s;erious religion was lo&s;t among&s;t us, while the cultivation of it was committed to our care. Shall we not be &s;u&s;pected of unfaithfulne&s;s to God, and to you, if it die in our hands? That were dreadful indeed. May the divine grace pre&s;erve us from that guilt! And I tru&s;t, my brethren, that it will pre&s;erve us; and, in dependence upon that I plainly tell you, that while God continues us in a capacity of doing it, we will hone&s;tly warn you, we will &s;eriou&s;ly ex|po&s;tulate with you, we will earne&s;tly pray for you; and if it be all in vain, we will appeal to an omni|&s;cient God, that your de&s;truction is not chargeable upon us, but upon your&s;elves.</P>
<P>BUT in the mean time, it would be dreadful to reflect, that while we are thus endeavouring to deli|ver our own &s;ouls, we are in effect heaping aggra|vated damnation on yours; while every attempt is re&s;i&s;ted by you, and &s;o brings you under a greater load of guilt. You may indeed be in&s;en&s;ible of the load now, but we fore&s;ee the day when you will &s;ink under it. And here is the accent of our &s;or|row; in &s;uch views as the&s;e we fear that when the mini&s;ters of former generations &s;hall appear before their judge with a train of happy &s;ouls; which have been conducted to heaven by their means, it mu&s;t be our melancholy part to &s;tand out as wit|ne&s;&s;es again&s;t our hearers, that we have &s;tretched

<P>Now pardon me, my friends, if I tell you, that we may rea&s;onably expect, that an argument of this nature &s;hould not be de&s;pi&s;ed. I hope it is no breach of mode&s;ty to &s;ay, that we have not de&s;erv|ed &s;o ill at your hands, as that our joy or our di|&s;tre&s;s, &s;hould be indifferent to you. In all the com|mon affairs of life we would chearfully &s;erve you to the utmo&s;t of our power, and therefore at lea&s;t rea&s;onably expect to &s;tand on a level with the re&s;t of your friends in like circum&s;tances. And our character as mini&s;ters, if we be careful to an&s;wer it, give us &s;ome peculiar claim to your regard. For you we give up many more &s;plendid pro&s;pects in life, which, in other employments, we might po&s;|&s;ibly have &s;ecured; for you we lay out our time and our &s;trength, in &s;tudy, in prayer, and in preach|ing. We bear you upon our hearts in our public mini&s;trations, and our private retirements; (and God is witne&s;s with what &s;incerity). Nor would we refu&s;e tho&s;e laborious &s;ervices, which, in human probability, might ha&s;ten upon us the infirmities of age, and the approach of death, if they might be the happy means of your conver&s;ion and &s;alva|tion. And is this the reward of all our friendly care? to weaken our hands, to grieve our &s;ouls, and to behave in &s;uch a manner, that the more ten|derly

Let me conclude this head with tho&s;e pa|thetic words of the apo&s;tle, if there be any bowels and mercies, fulfil ye your joy<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Phil. ii. 1. 2.</NOTE>. And let me intreat you to con&s;ider, one more,</P>
<P N="4">4. THAT the propagation of religion to future generations does, under God, chiefly depend upon you.</P>
<P>FOR this rea&s;on the pious I&s;raelites are repre|&s;ented, as re&s;olving to declare the wonderful works of God unto their children, that the generation to come might know them, even the children that &s;hould be born that they might ari&s;e, and, in their turn declare them unto their children<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm lxxviii. 4&mdash;6.</NOTE>, and &s;o the intail might be carried on to the remote&s;t ages.</P>
<P>Now, my brethren, it is evident, that the propa|gation of religion to &s;ucceeding generations does, humanly &s;peaking, depend on you and others, who, with you, are entering upon life. If you are un|der the influences of &s;erious godline&s;s, you will carry them along with you to the end of your

days; and when God calls you into families of your own, it will be your de&s;ire that you and your hou&s;es may &s;erve him<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;h&punc; xxiv. 15.</NOTE>. Family-prayer, and family-in&s;truction will be maintained; you will be teaching your children to know the Lord, and ex|horting them to &s;erve him, and praying for a ble&s;|&s;ing on tho&s;e endeavours: and who knows what a remarkable ble&s;&s;ing might attend them? Your chil|dren, under the impre&s;&s;ions of &s;uch an education, may be eminent for religion as you have been. They may be equally diligent in the care of their po&s;terity, and God may favour them with equal &s;ucce&s;s; and &s;o there may be thou&s;ands of your remote de&s;cendants, who never &s;aw you, nor per|haps heard of your name, who yet, under God, may owe their religion and their happine&s;s to you. The pro&s;pect of it may now afford you a &s;en&s;ible plea&s;ure; and it is highly probable that when they meet you in the regions of the invi&s;ible world, &s;uch an important obligation may engage them to treat you with peculiar re&s;pect and affection; as &s;urely all other obligations will appear trifling, when com|pared with this.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, if you neglect religion your|&s;elves, it cannot be thought you will be much con|cerned to tran&s;mit it to others. You would hardly be at the pains to give them good in&s;tructions; &s;uppo&s;ing you much more capable of doing it than you can expect to be: or if you do attempt it, tho&s;e in&s;tructions will be likely to have little effect, when they are contradicted by the daily language of your example. Nay, it is po&s;&s;ible you may ar|rive at &s;uch a height of wickedne&s;s, as directly to oppo&s;e practical godline&s;s, and breed up your chil|dren in the contempt of it; which is often to be &s;een, even in this chri&s;tian country. And what do

you think will become of &s;uch children as the&s;e? If you have been &s;o wicked, notwith&s;tanding all the re&s;traints of a &s;erious education, what will they be, who mi&s;s of the advantages you enjoyed, and mu&s;t be expo&s;ed to numberle&s;s temptations from which you were free? Shall the&s;e be a &s;eed to &s;erve the Lord? Shall the&s;e be accounted to him for a gene|ration? It might almo&s;t as well be expected, that a race of men &s;hould &s;pring up in a de&s;art, where no human creature ever appeared before them, as that true chri&s;tianity &s;hould be propogated in the world by children of &s;uch an education.</P>
<P>AND have you, after all, &s;o utter an indifference to the honour of that Redeemer, into who&s;e reli|gion you were baptized, and who&s;e name you bear, as that you could be contented, &s;hould it be lo&s;t in the world? Was it for this, that the Son of God de|&s;cended from heaven that he might publi&s;h the go&s;|pel covenant, and expired on the cro&s;s that he might e&s;tabli&s;h it? Was it for this that the pious labours of our ance&s;tors have tran&s;mitted this religion to us through &s;o many &s;ucceeding ages; and &s;o many martyrs have &s;ealed it by their &s;ufferings, and their blood? Was it for this, that our &s;acred liberties have been &s;o courageou&s;ly a&s;&s;erted by the be&s;t of men, and almo&s;t miraculou&s;ly defended by the hand of God? For this, that the precious intail &s;hould be cut off by us, and this invaluable trea&s;ure, the charge and the glory of &s;o many former genera|tions, &s;hould peri&s;h in our hands? That the name of chri&s;tianity &s;hould, for the future, be lo&s;t in the world; or which is altogether as bad, that it &s;hould &s;ink into an empty name, and a lifele&s;s circle of un|meaning forms? Yet, humanly &s;peaking, this mu&s;t be the con&s;equence, if you, and others of the ri&s;|ing generation, will not heartily engage in the in|tere&s;ts of it.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="046736_0033_1021EF7B03652400">
SUCH a variety of arguments concur to prove the great importance of the ri&s;ing generation. They are &s;o plain and &s;o weighty, that I cannot but think, that you, my brethren, to whom I have particularly applied them, are in your con&s;ciences convinced, that they are not to be di&s;puted.</P>

<P>IN Pro&s;ecution of this de&s;ign, I have made choice of the&s;e words of the apo&s;tle, which I have now been reading, and which may, without offering any violence to them, be very fairly and naturally accommodated to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>IT is plain, from many pa&s;&s;ages in this epi&s;tle, that the great apo&s;tle, who had planted the chri&s;tian church among the Galatians, had rea&s;on to fear, that many, who were by profe&s;&s;ion its members, were not &s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;hed in their holy faith. It is probable, that he him&s;elf had an oportunity of making but a &s;hort &s;tay among them; and, part|ly through their own negligence and prejudices, and partly through the artful attempts of fal&s;e teachers in the ab&s;ence of St Paul, they appear to have fallen into a &s;et of notions, and a conduct, which tended not only to impair the glory, but to &s;ubvert the very foundation, of the go&s;pel, and with it the foundation of their own eternal hopes. Of this the apo&s;tle does, in a very awful manner, admoni&s;h them. He tells them, in the very beginning of his epi&s;tle, that he marvelled that they were &s;o &s;oon re|moved from him that called them, (and from the prin|ciples he had taught them) into another go&s;pel<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. i. 6.</NOTE>. And afterwards he u&s;eth the&s;e very free and empha|tical words: O fooli&s;h Galatians, who hath be|witched, or enchanted you, that you &s;hould not obey the truth? Are you &s;o fooli&s;h? having begun in the &s;pirit (having profe&s;&s;ed to embrace the go&s;|pel,

and &s;hewn the appearances of &s;ome common zeal for it), can you now hope to be made perfect by the fle&s;h, or by the ritual and carnal ob&s;ervances of the Mo&s;aic in&s;titution?

On the whole, he tells them, he was ready to appre|hend that all the agreeable hopes, he had at once en|tertained concerning them, would be buried in ever|la&s;ting di&s;appointment, and that it would appear, he had be&s;towed upon them labour in vain<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Chap iv. 11.</NOTE>. Thus did he &s;tand in doubt of them<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">Chap. iv. 20.</NOTE>; and that doubt pierced his heart with the mo&s;t tender con|cern, and brought upon him, as it were a &s;econd time, tho&s;e pangs of &s;oul which he had felt on their account, when he &s;aw them in all the igno|rance and wickedne&s;s of their gentile &s;tate. He was hardly more &s;olicitous that they might be turn|ed from dumb idols to the living God, than he was now, that they might give convincing eviden|ces that Chri&s;t was formed in them, i. e. that they had cordially received and dige&s;ted the go&s;pel, and that their hearts were delivered into the mould of it<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">Rom. vi. 17.</NOTE>; which it did not appear they were, while they were thus making void the grace of God, and the righteou&s;ne&s;s of faith, by adhering to the fool|i&s;h and pernicious doctrine of the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eek|ing their ju&s;tification, in part at lea&s;t, by the ob&s;er|vation of the Mo&s;aic law.</P>
<P>This &s;eems to be the mo&s;t natural &s;en&s;e of the words of the text, where &s;uch a latitude of expre&s;|&s;ion is u&s;ed, as the apo&s;tle el&s;ewhere &s;eems to &s;tudy, on purpo&s;e to render his writings univer&s;ally edify|ing and u&s;eful to them, who&s;e particular circum|&s;tances in life are widely different from tho&s;e of the per&s;ons to whom they were originally addre&s;&s;ed.

As to the introductory words, my little children, we cannot imagine they refer to the age of tho&s;e to whom the apo&s;tle wrote.

So that, on the whole, tho&s;e illuminations, or tho&s;e affections, on which you are apt to lay &s;o great a &s;tre&s;s, are, perhaps, at be&s;t, but the preparatory workings of the Spirit upon your minds, which if they are improved aright, may leave you more hard, and more mi&s;e|rable than they found you.</P>

<P N="1">1. How important is it, that mini&s;ters &s;hould lead young per&s;ons into &s;uch views as the&s;e!</P>
<P>OUR great and important bu&s;ine&s;s in life is to promote the eternal happine&s;s of our hearers, and to lay a &s;olid foundation of hope and joy in their &s;ouls. We have &s;een now what it is, and other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Je&s;us Chri&s;t<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. iii. 11.</NOTE>. Here then let all our labours centre. It is the good old way, in which our fa|thers in the mini&s;try went, and in which they pro&s;|pered. Let us follow their &s;teps, and exert our mo&s;t vigorous efforts here. Modern refinements may amu&s;e us in our clo&s;ets, but they will never feed the &s;ouls of our hearers, nor &s;pread the tri|umphs of a go&s;pel, which was the power of God to the &s;alvation of thou&s;ands, before they were ever dreamt of. I hope, God is my witne&s;s, that I am heartily concerned for the intere&s;t of virtue, (if by that be meant the advancement of practical re|ligion); but I never expected to &s;ee it promoted by the mo&s;t philo&s;ophical &s;peculations concerning its nature, or the fine&s;t harrangues of it's innate beauties, when the names and peculiar doctrines of Chri&s;t are thrown off, as unfa&s;hionable incumbranc|es of a di&s;cour&s;e. Experienced chri&s;tians, who have ta&s;ted the bread of life, will not contentedly be put off with &s;uch chaff: and if we imagine that the younger part of our auditors may be trained

<P N="2">2. WE may learn from hence, what are the mo&s;t valuable proofs of parental affection.</P>
<P>CERTAINLY there is no rea&s;on to e&s;teem, as &s;uch that fond indulgence which &s;uffers ill habits to grow up in the young mind, and fears it's pre&s;ent di&s;turbance more than its future ruin: no, nor yet the more prudent care of providing plentiful and agreeable accommodations, for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tance and delight of your infant offspring, as they advance to maturity and &s;ettlement in life. The&s;e things indeed are not to be neglected; but wretched are the children, and I will add, the parents too, where this is the principle labour. Would you expre&s;s a wi&s;e and religious tenderne&s;s, for which your chil|dren &s;hall have rea&s;on to thank you in their dying moments, and to meet you with joy in the inter|views of the eternal world? do your utmo&s;t that Chri&s;t be formed in their &s;ouls; and let them plain|ly &s;ee, that you even travail in birth again, till this happy work be accompli&s;hed. But this leads me to add,</P>
<P N="3">3. WHAT need is there of the work of the di|vine Spirit on the heart, in order to the lay|ing this great foundation?</P>
<P>THE language of the text, which &s;peaks of Chri&s;t formed in us, naturally leads our thoughts

But as it is nothing le&s;s than the transformation of a corrupt and degenerate creature into the holy image of the &s;on of God, it were impiety for ei|ther to arrogate it to our&s;elves.</P>
<P>LET us therefore, on the whole, learn our duty and our wi&s;dom. Let the matter be brought to a &s;erious and immediate review, and let us judge our|&s;elves by the character de&s;cribed, as tho&s;e that ex|pect very &s;hortly to be judged of the Lord.&mdash;If, on the examination, any of you have rea&s;on to conclude that you are &s;trangers to it, remember that the invinceable battery of the word of God demoli&s;hes all the towering hopes you may have rai&s;ed on any other foundation.

If nothing be indeed found of great|er moment, apply your&s;elves &s;eriou&s;ly to this, and omit no proper and rational method of &s;ecuring it.

<P>IF we have any regard to the judgment of the wi&s;e&s;t of men, illuminated and directed by the influences of the divine &s;pirit, we mu&s;t certainly own, that ill company is a very dangerous &s;nare, and that young per&s;ons &s;hould be frequently and earne&s;tly cautioned again&s;t it. The excellent col|lection, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> and religious precepts, contained in this book of Proverbs, was e&s;pecially intended to give &s;ubtilty or prudence to the &s;imple, and to the young man knowledge and di&s;cretion<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Prov. i. 4.</NOTE>.

This faithful and compa&s;&s;ionate coun&s;ellor doth not content him&s;elf with di&s;&s;uading his young reader from joining with notorious offenders in their crimes, but even from going in the way with them, or with any other evil men; nay, from entering upon it, or even approach|ing it, &s;o much as to pa&s;s by it, if there were not a nece&s;&s;ity of doing it.

<P>SUCH le&s;&s;ons did Solomon teach; and &s;uch had he him&s;elf learnt from David his father.

AND here &s;urely I need not be large in telling you what I mean by bad company. It is, in gene|ral, <Q>the conver&s;ation of tho&s;e, who are apparent|ly de&s;titute of the fear of God;</Q> and &s;o it takes in, not only per&s;ons of the mo&s;t di&s;&s;olute and aban|doned characters, but tho&s;e vain and worthle&s;s crea|tures who manife&s;t a neglect of religion, though free from gro&s;s and &s;candalous immoralities.

<P>IT is no &s;mall evil for an immortal creature, who was &s;ent into the world to &s;erve God, and to &s;ecure a happy immortality, to live in vain, and trifle away hour after hour, in mere idlene&s;s and impertinence.

Unhappy as this is, would to God that it always re&s;ted here! the world would at lea&s;t be more peaceful, and your damnation, &s;inners, would be le&s;s intolerable. But daily ob&s;ervation undeni|ably proves, that by evil examples, and wicked com|panions, people generally learn gluttony and drunk|enne&s;s, &s;wearing and uncleanne&s;s. It engages them in fooli&s;h quarrels, in which they bla&s;pheme the name of God, and injure their neighbour; and it ha|bituates them to &s;uch extravagant ways of living, as they are forced to &s;upport by &s;ecret di&s;hone&s;ty, and very often by open robbery.

this &s;olemn charge, as in the name and pre&s;ence of God, I di&s;mi&s;s you from this head, and pro|ceed,</P>
<P>III. To tho&s;e reflections and inferences, with which I &s;hall conclude the di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. IF &s;o many evils and dangers attend the pur|&s;uit of wicked company, how careful &s;hould parents and governors be, to keep young peo|ple out of the way of it!</P>
<P>YOU &s;ee, from all I have been &s;aying, how ne|ce&s;&s;ary this care is, if you de&s;ire they &s;hould be hap|py in this world, or the next. It is a dreadful charge that is brought again&s;t Eli, and a dreadful doom is pronounced upon him for it; that his &s;ons made them&s;elves vile, and that he re&s;trained them not<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. iii. 13.</NOTE>.

<P>AND here I would ob&s;erve, that your care mu&s;t begin very early, and that it mu&s;t take a great com|pa&s;s. You &s;hould endeavour betimes to lay in an antidote again&s;t the future poi&s;on, by labouring to the utmo&s;t to po&s;&s;e&s;s their infant minds with a &s;en&s;e of the divine pre&s;ence, a de&s;ire of plea&s;ing God, and a dread of offending him. You &s;hould endeavour to in&s;pire them with an abhorrence of &s;in, and a love to the ways and people of God. Endeavour to find out &s;uitable company for them, and to make your own company as delightful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> as you can. In|dulge them in &s;uch diver&s;ions, as duty and prudence will admit; for too rigorous a re&s;traint from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e things makes them eager to pur&s;ue them, wherever

they are to be found. And if you &s;ee they begin to form an acquaintance with &s;uch as you think likely to in&s;nare and corrupt them, fir&s;t gently warn them of it, and endeavour by the ea&s;ie&s;t methods to draw them off: if tho&s;e will not do, rea&s;on with them more largely on the head; lay before them the various dangers they will be expo&s;ed to, and &s;hew them the in&s;tances of tho&s;e who have been injured and ruined by &s;uch company: in&s;tances, which, it is to be feared, you will always have near at hand: and if all this be not enough, interpo&s;e with the au|thority God has given you; ab&s;olutely forbid them the place and company, and let them &s;ee, by your after-conduct, that you are in good earne&s;t in the prohibition. At the &s;ame time, endeavour to re|commend religion to them in the mo&s;t amiable light, that they may be convinced it carries its entertain|ment along with it, &s;o that there is no need of &s;eek|ing plea&s;ure in the paths of the de&s;troyer. I know this is a matter of difficulty, and requires a great deal of prudence and &s;teadine&s;s to conduct it aright; but I am per&s;uaded, if parents and ma&s;ters were careful in this re&s;pect, few would be ruined till they came to be at their own di&s;po&s;al, and the de|&s;truction of multitudes would be intirely prevent|ed. May God graciou&s;ly give you wi&s;dom to know your duty, and faithfulne&s;s to perform it!</P>
<P N="2">2. IF wicked company be &s;o pernicious, as we have heard; then how cautious &s;hould we be in the choice of a companion for life, if you are in &s;uch circum&s;tances, as to have that choice before you.</P>
<P>IT is evident, that, as all bad company is danger|ous, &s;o the nearer it is to us, and the more frequent the opportunities of conver&s;ing with it, the greater mi&s;chief will it probably do us. Tho&s;e who are in

the conjugal relation, &s;hould make it their great bu|&s;ine&s;s and care, to a&s;&s;i&s;t and animate each other in the ways of God; and &s;uch is the prevalency of our &s;inful nature, and &s;o many the &s;nares and temp|tations of life, that, with all po&s;&s;ible advantages our progre&s;s will be too &s;low, and too frequently in|terrupted. What then could you expect, if you had tho&s;e, not only in your hou&s;es, but in your arms too, from whom you would hardly ever hear a &s;erious word; and who would perhaps be unwil|ling to give you the hearing, if you &s;hould attempt any &s;uch di&s;cour&s;e: nay, might po&s;&s;ibly revile or banter you for it, and, by their impious language, and wicked example, might greatly deaden religious &s;entiments in your heart, and either prevent or fru&s;|trate your endeavours or communicating them to tho&s;e under your care? When chri&s;tians of one &s;ex or the other, chu&s;e &s;uch a companion for life, they &s;eem to lie under great difficulties, and will be in imminent danger, either, on the one hand, of fail|ing in a due affection and regard, or on the other, of being perverted and en&s;nared by that very affec|tion, which both the duties of the relation, and the comfort of life &s;o evidently require. If any of you have taken this hazardous &s;tep, I have nothing to do but to advi&s;e you, to be daily looking up to God for that extraordinary prudence which your cir|cum&s;tances require. But this is &s;uch a &s;ituation, that I cannot forbear praying, that, as for tho&s;e of you who are yet &s;ingle, no con&s;iderations of beau|ty, wit, temper, or fortune, may ever prevail upon you to bow your necks to &s;o unequal a yoke.</P>

<P>BU<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> I have frequently found, and I believe it has been the experience of many of my brethren in the mini&s;try, that young per&s;ons, not only of a very &s;ober and regular conduct, but even tho&s;e who have appeared mo&s;t deeply impre&s;&s;ed with the concerns of their &s;ouls, and experimentally acquainted, &s;o far as we can judge, with regenerating grace, have, in many in&s;tances, &s;hewn a &s;trange coldne&s;s to this ble&s;&s;ed in&s;titution; and we have known not a few who have grown old in the neglect of it.

<P>AND here permit me more largely to plead the weight of a dying Redeemer's command, as well as the honour, the plea&s;ure, and the various advantages of an early compliance with it.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE ordinance to which I now invite you, is the known command and in&s;titution of a dy|ing Redeemer.</P>

I NEED not enlarge on the proof of what is &s;o apparent. You undoubtedly know that Matthew and Mark, and Luke, agree in giving us the hi|&s;tory of its in&s;titution<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxvi. 26&mdash;27. Mark xiv. 22&mdash;24. Luke. xxii. 19, 20.</NOTE> And St. Paul af|terwards received it by expre&s;s revelation from Chri&s;t<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xi. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &amp; <HI>&s;eq.</HI></NOTE>, and accordingly relates it in a very cir|cum&s;tantial and pathetic manner; telling us not on|ly that Chri&s;t commanded that this &s;hould be done in remembrance of him, but al&s;o that, by an attend|ance upon it, our Lord's death is &s;hewed forth till he come; plainly intimating thereby, (what the ends of the ordinance do farther evince), that it was to continue in the church to its remote&s;t ages. So that, on the whole, you exceedingly mi&s;take if you imagine this to be mere matter of choice, in any other &s;en&s;e, than as all the duty of a rational creature is &s;o. Our Lord has plainly determined the matter by his own &s;acred authority, leaving this ordinance in charge to all his followers. I &s;ay to all, for there is no limitation as to the age of tho&s;e that &s;hould attend it. It is a command to young and old, as well as to rich and poor; and all, that are capable of under&s;tanding it, are obliged to com|ply with it, and thereby to do their homage to their exalted &s;overeign, and expre&s;s their gratitude to their mo&s;t generous friend. And can you in rea|&s;on refu&s;e your compliance? Methinks the name of the &s;on of God &s;hould carry along with it an au|thority too great to be de&s;pi&s;ed, and the name of your redeemer a con&s;training love too forcible to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with&s;tood; e&s;pecially the name of a dying Redeem|er. Surely, my friends, if a dying parent, or bro|ther, had given you a charge almo&s;t with his ex|piring breath, you could not lightly have acted con|trary to it. How much greater regard do you

Had it been &s;ome hard thing that he had then enjoined, and had the rea&s;on of it been unknown, &s;o that it had appeared as a mere arbitrary con&s;titution, the neglect of it had been fooli&s;h and ungrateful. Had it been a more painful rite than that of initiation among&s;t the Jews, more laborious than their frequent jour|nies to Jeru&s;alem, and more co&s;tly than the &s;acrific|es they offered there, the precept of our dying Lord had carried in it an abundant an&s;wer to all that ea&s;e or intere&s;t could have pleaded again&s;t it: how much more, when the rea&s;on is &s;o evident, and the ob&s;ervation, in all re&s;pects, &s;o ea&s;y! Judge, I pray you, whether it would be neglected. Judge, whether it be a decent thing, that when we are &s;it|ting down to break and eat bread, and to pour forth and drink wine, that we may repre&s;ent the breaking of Chri&s;t's body, and the pouring forth of his blood, and &s;eal our covenant-engagements with him, more than one half of the profe&s;&s;ing, chri&s;tians in the a&s;&s;embly &s;hould ri&s;e, and either leave the place, or withdraw to a di&s;tance from the holy table. What is this but to &s;ay, <Q>We will now have no|thing to do with the memorials of a crucified Sa|viour?</Q> Will you, my friends, thus &s;eperate your|&s;elves from us? What if others were to learn of you, and to imitate your example? Where would the ordinance quickly be? Nay, where would it al|ready have been, had this temper prevailed? Where, but in our bibles?

2. AN early attendance upon this ordinance will be truly honourable to you.</P>
<P>I WISH I could &s;ay that the omi&s;&s;ion of it were, in the repute of the generality of profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;|tians, &s;o di&s;honourable as it ought; but it is now grown &s;o common, that much of the ju&s;t infamy of it is worn off. Neverthele&s;s, if we will &s;eriou&s;|ly con&s;ider it, we mu&s;t own, that where rea&s;on and duty require any practice, (which I have already proved to be the ca&s;e here,) the more frequently it is neglected, the more honourable is a regard to it; as it argues a laudable fortitude of mind, to oppo&s;e a prevailing evil, by which multitudes are borne away. And who, that hath any &s;en&s;e of genero&s;i|ty and goodne&s;s, would not wi&s;h to &s;ignalize him|&s;elf on &s;uch an occa&s;ion as this?</P>
<P>I APPEAL to your own hearts, my brethren, even when you have dive&s;ted your&s;elves of every &s;enti|ment of o&s;tentation and pride, (which I would not de&s;ire to pre&s;s into the &s;ervice of the &s;anctua|ry), would is not afford you a rational and pious plea&s;ure to reflect, that your fellow-chri&s;tians might &s;ay with regard to you, <Q>The&s;e are the per&s;ons who are happily di&s;tingui&s;hed from mo&s;t of their companions, by obedience to God and gratitude to their Redeemer; they dare &s;tand up for the ho|nour of his in&s;titutions, and of his name, in the mid&s;t of all the languor, and all the impiety of a degenerate age.

<P N="3">3. LET me plead the plea&s;ure which this ordi|nance affords, as a farther argument for an ear|ly attendance upon it.</P>
<P>IF your hearts have been touched by regenerating grace, you mu&s;t &s;urely know, that communion with God through a mediator is unutterably delightful: and mu&s;t own, that when you enjoy it, your &s;ouls are &s;atisfied, as with marrow and fatne&s;s<NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE>.

Now, when you con&s;ider the Lord's &s;upper as an ordinance of divine appoint|ment, you have ju&s;t rea&s;on to hope, that God will honour it with his gracious pre&s;ence; nay, when you con&s;ider the nature and de&s;ign of the in&s;tituti|on, you may probably <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ome peculiar &s;weet|ne&s;s and delight in it beyond what you have hither|to known.

<P>OH, my friends, what a &s;cene is there opened, when, by the&s;e lively memorials of his dying love, the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is evidently &s;et forth as cruci|fied among us<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Gal. iii. 1.</NOTE>! Surely the &s;pectacle mu&s;t be de|lightful, even to creatures who are them&s;elves per|fectly innocent and holy!

<P N="1">(1) It might be u&s;eful to your&s;elves in a variety of re&s;pects.</P>
<P>I CONSIDER, that I am now &s;peaking to them that look upon improvement in religion as their highe&s;t intere&s;t; and therefore &s;hall only endeavour to &s;hew you, what a tendency this ordinance has to a&s;&s;i&s;t you therein; and that is &s;o evident, that I need not dwell largely on particulars, which, when &s;ugge&s;t|ed in a few words, may furni&s;h you with matter of ample meditation.

<P>THE preparatory exerci&s;es of devotion might be very awakening and edifying to you. The re|view of your conduct, which you would be taking on the approach of the&s;e &s;olemn &s;ea&s;ons; the pray|ers and prai&s;es you would then be addre&s;&s;ing to God, and the meditations in which your minds would be employed, would rou&s;e you out of that lethargy into which you may be ready to &s;ink, and which the be&s;t of men find too frequently prevailing.</P>
<P>THE views of a bleeding Redeemer, of a recon|ciled God, of a confirmed covenant, and of a world of approaching glory, which this ordinance &s;o na|turally exhibit, would &s;trengthen, as well as delight, your &s;ouls; and, by virtue of the refre&s;hments re|ceived at the&s;e &s;olemnities, you might be enabled to go on your way rejoicing, and to make a &s;en&s;ible pro|gre&s;s in your journey towards the heavenly Canaan.</P>
<P>THE remembrance of tho&s;e &s;olemn engagements, with which you would then be binding your &s;ouls unto the Lord, would be a ready an&s;wer in hours of future temptations. You would &s;tart back with horror at the thought of alienating your &s;ervices from a God, to whom you had &s;o &s;eriou&s;ly and pub|licly

<P>I SHALL only add here, that, by entering thus early into the communion of a church, you will be brought under the more immediate in&s;pection of the pa&s;tor of it, and likewi&s;e of your chri&s;tian brethren; who&s;e faithful and tender admonitions may be of great a&s;&s;i&s;tance to your unexperienced youth, and happily promote your progre&s;s, both in the paths of prudence, and of holine&s;s. Nay, the very thoughts of having drawn upon you the eyes of a &s;ociety, and of others too, would engage you to &s;ome more than ordinary care, that you might not incur their cen&s;ure, or di&s;appoint the expectati|ons which many have rai&s;ed of you. And, in con|firmation of all this, I cannot but ob&s;erve, that many of the mo&s;t eminent chri&s;tians I have ever known, were found among&s;t tho&s;e, who in their ear|ly days took this method of giving them&s;elves to God and his people.&mdash;I might farther &s;hew you,</P>
<P N="2">(2) THAT your compliance with the exhortati|on I am now enforcing, might be u&s;eful to others, as well as to your&s;elves.</P>
<P>THIS is indeed, in part of con&s;equence of the former; for, the more your own &s;ouls are advanced in knowledge and holine&s;s, the more capable, and the more ready will you be, to promote the intere&s;t of Chri&s;t in the world, and to do good to tho&s;e that are round about you. But I would e&s;pecially lead you to con&s;ider, that your attendance it&s;elf, &s;e|parate from the&s;e remoter con&s;equences of it, might probably be u&s;eful to others.</P>

And if the enumeration be not &s;o large, or the reply &s;o full as you could wi&s;h, you know where you will be always welcome to propo&s;e your &s;cruples as freely, and to &s;tate them as amply, as you plea&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE mo&s;t obvious reply to the preceding ad|dre&s;s is, that <Q>you fear you are not prepared for this ordinance, and therefore apprehend, that your attendance would prove dange|rous, rather than beneficial.</Q></P>
<P>TO this I an&s;wer; if the ca&s;e be indeed thus, I have already told you, that you are not the per&s;ons to whom I have been addre&s;&s;ing. Neverthele&s;s, give me leave to remind you, that you ought not ra&s;hly to form &s;uch a conclu&s;ion again&s;t your&s;elves. I am &s;ure the matter requires a very attentive ex|amination; and perhaps, on &s;uch a review, you may find things are not &s;o bad as you imagine.</P>
<P>YOU &s;ay, you are not prepared: but I hope you know that there is a great deal of difference be|tween the nature and importance of an actual and habitual preparation. It is plain, that actual pre|paration con&s;i&s;t in tho&s;e extraordinary devotions, which, when opportunity permits, we &s;hould u&s;e in

<P>BUT you fear, that you are not habitually pre|pared, i. e. that you are not per&s;ons of &s;uch a temper and character as Chri&s;t, the great Lord of the fea&s;t, has invited, and will welcome to it. To determine that, con&s;ider the purpo&s;es for which the ordinance was appointed, and ob&s;erve how far your pre&s;ent temper corre&s;ponds to them. It was appointed to commemorate the death of Chri&s;t, and, in this view, all are fit for it, who re|gard him as the great atoning &s;acrifice, and de&s;ire that their hearts may be affected, and their lives influenced, by a &s;en&s;e of his dying love. It is a pledge of our mutual affection to each other, even to all our brethren in the Lord; and in this re&s;pect, all are prepared for it who&s;e hearts are divested of all turbulent and unfriendly pa&s;&s;ions, and overflow with undi&s;&s;embled charity and diffu&s;ive benevo|lence. True, will you perhaps &s;ay; but is it not al&s;o de&s;igned as a &s;eal of the covenant of grace<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> It certainly is; and it mu&s;t be a very criminal propha|nation to attend it, while an alien from that cove|nant: your determination therefore mu&s;t turn on the an&s;wer which con&s;cience will make, as to your readine&s;s to enter your&s;elves into it.

But if you are &s;trangers to &s;uch a de&s;ire, I mu&s;t allow the objection in its full force, and own, that you have no bu&s;ine&s;s at the table of the Lord</P>
<P>NEVERTHELESS I cannot part with you &s;o. Oh my friends, is there nothing mournful, and, I will add, is there nothing dreadful, in &s;uch a con|clu&s;ion as this? <Q>I have no bu&s;ine&s;s at the table of the Lord&punc; I have no part in this ble&s;&s;ed re|pa&s;t, becau&s;e I have no part in that Redeemer, who&s;e death is commemorated there: and there|fore I am &s;hut out, by his own appointment &s;hut out! and is not that a &s;ad intimation with re&s;pect to what is yet to come? When I enter on the in|vi&s;ible and eternal &s;tate, as I this night may, will he admit me to live and reign with him in a world of glory, who would not allow me &s;o much as an approach to his table on earth? Oh my &s;oul, it is too plain, thou mu&s;t be &s;eparated from his bli&s;sful pre&s;ence, and driven to an eternal di&s;|tance, whence thou wilt behold with de&s;pairing eyes tho&s;e pious &s;ouls, who have eaten and drank with him here, &s;itting down with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his king|dom.</Q> This will not &s;eem a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> then: oh that it might now be duly regarded!</P>
<P>FROM all this it will appear, that if this objecti|on from an unprepared temper be true, it ought not to be lightly pa&s;&s;ed over, but &s;hould rather be &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered, and the removal of it, through divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, immediately attempted; &s;ince, till you are prepared for this &s;acrament, you cannot be prepared for heaven; and con&s;equently are in circum&s;tances of the extreme&s;t danger, and daily walk on the precipice of eternal ruin.</P>

I think it is one of the mo&s;t impor|tant ble&s;&s;ings of my life, that there are many &s;uch in the church here; many who, through the divine goodne&s;s, have lately been added to it. It would not be ea&s;y for me, my dear brethren and friends, to &s;ay how great plea&s;ure your pre&s;ence and &s;ociety adds to my &s;acrament-days; or what a delightful pro&s;pect it gives me, not only as to the comfort of my own more advanced age, but as to the &s;upport of religion here, when I am no longer among&s;t you. I, and our more aged friends, have rea&s;on to re|joice on this occa&s;ion; but &s;urely you your&s;elves have much greater rea&s;on. Permit me to remind you, that it will be a mo&s;t proper expre&s;&s;ion of your thankfulne&s;s, to labour with the utmo&s;t care to engage other young per&s;ons, your brethren and companions, to come and &s;hare with you in this fea&s;t. I hope, your own experience of the plea|&s;ure, and advantage which attends it, may be add|ed to the other arguments I have been pleading. As for your own conduct, let me mo&s;t affection|ately intreat, and mo&s;t &s;olemnly charge you, not only by all other arguments, but by your &s;acramen|tal vows; by the eyes of God, and of man, that are upon you; by all our expectations from you, and all your engagements to us; that as you have

<P>I BELIEVE all of you, who are acquainted with the ca&s;e &s;incerely pity them, and wi&s;h their relief; but I am under &s;ome peculiar obligations to de&s;ire and attempt it; not only on account of my public character, but as I know the heart of an orphan, having my&s;elf been deprived of both my parents, at an age, in which it might rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed a child &s;hould be mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of &s;uch a lo&s;s.

"When my father and my mother for&s;ake me, then the Lord will take me up."</P>
<P>As for the P&s;alm from whence the&s;e words are taken, we are told in the title, that it was compo&s;|ed by David, but are left to conjecture to the par|ticular occa&s;ion of it. Dr. Patrick refers it to the latter end of his time, and to the combat that he had with the Phili&s;tines in his declining age; when we are told, that David waxed faint, and was in great danger of being killed by a giant, if Abi|&s;hal, the brother of Joab, had not &s;ea&s;onably re&s;|cued him; upon which it is added, that his &s;ub|jects &s;ware, He &s;hould no more go out to battle, le&s;t he &s;hould quench the light of I&s;rael<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. xxi. 15, 17.</NOTE>. To the&s;e words David is &s;upppo&s;ed to allude, when he &s;ays, The Lord is my light, and my &s;alvation, whom &s;hall I fear?&mdash;Mine enemies come upon me to eat up my fle&s;h;&mdash;and I had fainted, unle&s;s I had believed<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xxvii. 1, 2, 13.</NOTE>. But I am rather inclined to
<PB N="124" REF="046736_0119_1021F2AADD21F260">
conjecture, that this P&s;alm was compo&s;ed by him in his younger years, when he was under per&s;ecu|tion from Saul. There is not a line in it, which doth not agree with this &s;uppo&s;ition; and there are &s;everal ver&s;es, which cannot &s;o well be accom|modated to the other; e&s;pecially the 12th, in which he repre&s;ents his dangers as ari&s;ing from fal&s;e wit|ne&s;&s;es. Now it is not ea&s;y to imagine, what mi&s;|cheif they could have done him among&s;t the Phili&s;|tines who oppo&s;ed him in a national, rather than a per&s;onal quarrel; but he expre&s;sly declares el&s;e|where, that the lying words of &s;ome treacherous per&s;ons had exa&s;perated Saul again&s;t him<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">1 Sam, xxiv. 9.</NOTE>; and complains of fal&s;e tongues, in tho&s;e P&s;alms, which are, by their title, fixed to this period of his hi&s;to|ry<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. lii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, 3, 4.&mdash;lvii. 4, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">x. 12.</NOTE>. I might add, that the words of the text &s;eem to favour this &s;uppo&s;ition; for David doth not here &s;ay, that his father and mother had alrea|dy for&s;aken him, but only &s;peaks of it as what might happen. Now, as we are el&s;ewhere told, that when David was but a lad, his father was an old man<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. xvii. 12.</NOTE>, it is very improbable, that both Je&s;&s;e and his wife &s;hould have been living at the time of this Phili&s;tine war, when David him&s;elf was grown old and feeble.</P>
<P>IF this argument be of weight to &s;ix the general occa&s;ion of the P&s;alm, it is proable that this ver&s;e may lead us to the particular time of its compo&s;ure We are told, that when David had taken &s;helter at Adullam, from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> violence of Saul, and had rai&s;|ed a band of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> for his defence, he conveyed his father and mother to the king of Moab<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">chap. xxii. 3.</NOTE>, de&s;ir|ing that, till providence had brought his affairs to a determination, that prince would &s;helter them from the fury of Saul, which might otherwi&s;e have proved fatal to them, as it had ju&s;t before done to
<PB N="125" REF="046736_0120_1021F2ACCC76AC80">
the prie&s;ts of the Lord. Perhaps this was the pi|ous reflection of David, about the time his parents were to remove: When my father and mother for|&s;ake me, then the Lord will take me up. As if he &s;hould have &s;aid, <Q>Though an ho&s;t of my ene|mies be encamping again&s;t me, and the nation be ri&s;ing in arms to oppo&s;e me; and though I be forced to di&s;mi&s;s my aged parents, at a time when I have the greate&s;t occa&s;ion for their pru|dent advice, and their tender con&s;olations; yet this my comfort, that God is with me. He will &s;upply what I lo&s;e in them; he will take me up, and nouri&s;h me as his own child, when their parental tenderne&s;s can afford me no farther &s;up|port.</Q></P>
<P>THE Words will naturally afford us the&s;e two plain remarks, which, with the improvement of them, will be the foundation of the pre&s;ent di&s;|cour&s;e.</P>

<P N="1">1. OUR deare&s;t friends may abandon us through their own unkindne&s;s.</P>
<P>IT is the remarkable &s;aying of one, who had made many &s;erious reflections on th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> head<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Baxter.</NOTE>; <Q>If you put &s;o much confidence in any friend, as not to con&s;ider, that it is po&s;&s;ible he may become your enemy, you know man but little, and per|haps may be taught to know him better to your co&s;t.</Q> Change of circum&s;tances, contrariety <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> intere&s;t, our own mi&s;takes, the mi&s;repre&s;entatives of others, and &s;ometimes mere caprice, and incon|&s;tancy of temper, render tho&s;e indifferent, and per|haps aver&s;e to each other, who were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> united in the bonds of the mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> friend&s;hip. Nay, it is certain, that &s;ometimes an immoderate and ungoverned fondne&s;s on both &s;ides, may not only ju&s;tly provoke God to di&s;appoint our hopes from each other; but may prove, in its natural con&s;e|quences, an occa&s;ion of mutual di&s;gu&s;t, and per|haps of &s;eparation. For, when the mind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> under this di&s;order, it contracts a kind of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">kly peevi&s;hne&s;s, which turns every tri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ing neglect into an offence, and every offence into a crime; &s;o that men find the extremes of love and hatred more nearly connected, than they could once have be|lieved.

<P>Seen is the vanity of human friend&s;hip. And I will add, that neither, on the one hand, the &s;in|cerity of our affection, nor the worth of our cha|racter, nor the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of our affairs; nor, on the other hand, the former appearance of goodne&s;s in them, nor the highe&s;t obligations of gratitude; nor yet, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> of blood, or alliance, can &s;ecure us from di&s;&s;appointment in this tender arti|cle.

But be they ever &s;o con&s;tant and affectionate, it is certain,</P>
<P N="2">2. THEY may be taken away from us by the &s;troke of divine providence.</P>
<P>WHILST we are in the mo&s;t delightful manner conver&s;ing with our friends, God may bring us into &s;uch circum&s;tances, that we &s;hall &s;ee our&s;elves oblig|ed in duty to quit the deare&s;t of them, po&s;&s;ibly even contrary to their judgment and advice, as well as their importunate intreaties; or they may &s;ee them&s;elves obliged, on the &s;ame principles, to quit us; &s;o that we may &s;eldom have the opportunity of &s;eeing each other, and enjoying the plea&s;ure of mu|tual conver&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT the &s;evere&s;t trial is, when God &s;ees fit to remove them by death. When that awful me&s;&s;en|ger gives the &s;ummons, we mu&s;t part, though ever &s;o de&s;irous of continuing together. None can by any means deliver his brother from going down to the grave, nor give to God a ran&s;om for him<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xlix. 7, 8.</NOTE>, though he &s;hould offer his own life under that view.

by death! Perhaps, more than are left be|hind. We have followed them to the grave, we have left them in the du&s;t, and their places that knew them, know them no more<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Job vii. 10.</NOTE>. And if we are not quickly taken our&s;elves, we mu&s;t expect, that our breaches will &s;oon be multiplied upon us; and that nothing will remain of tho&s;e dear crea|tures, whom we now behold with tenderne&s;s, and with tran&s;port, but a mournful remembrance that we once enjoyed them, and a de&s;pair of recovering them again, till we meet in the eternal world.</P>
<P>I WILL only add one very obvious reflection up|on this head, and then proceed to the next.</P>
<P>MAY the deare&s;t of our friends &s;o &s;oon for&s;ake us? Then how careful &s;hould we be, that we do not value them too highly, and love them too fondly?</P>
<P>WE find in &s;cripture, that the incon&s;tancy, and the mortality of human nature, are each of them urged as an argument again&s;t tru&s;ting in man. Thus we are cautioned to take heed every one of his neighbour, and tru&s;t not in any brother; for every brother will utterly &s;upplant, and every neighbour will walk with &s;landers<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Jer. ix. 4.</NOTE>.

<P>NATURE has implanted even in irrational animals, &s;uch a regard to the &s;afety of their offspring, that many of the mo&s;t weak and timorous of them be|come &s;trangely couragious in their defence. The little bird, that will at other times &s;ly from every noi&s;e and every motion, will hover over her young, when they are a&s;&s;aulted with danger; and, rather than &s;he will for&s;ake them, will &s;hare in their ruin. It is ea&s;y to perceive the &s;pirit of parents, natural|ly ri&s;e on the lea&s;t injury that is offered to their children, even &s;ometimes when it is only accidental, and unde&s;igned; and all the profe&s;&s;ed enemies of their children, they of cour&s;e reckon to be their own. Nor do they only watch over them in their infancy and childhood, to defend them from the many dangers which &s;urround tho&s;e tender days;

but in more advanced years, they are ready to u&s;e all their power and their influence, to &s;helter them from the unworthy u&s;age which they might otherwi&s;e ex|pect from an ill natured world: and I own, it is a very melancholy thing for young people to lo&s;e &s;uch, a guard, at a time when they are mo&s;t expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>BUT &s;urely the defence of the Almighty mu&s;t be a much ju&s;ter and nobler confidence. It is amazing to ob&s;erve, in how conde&s;cending a man|ner he expre&s;&s;es his care for the protection of his people.

And could we de&s;ire a better guard? There are many &s;ea&s;ons, when our earthly parents mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be &s;eparated from us; and a thou&s;and calamities might overtake and de&s;troy us, even in their pre&s;ence, while they &s;tood by helple&s;s and amazed: but God is always with his children, and as there is no danger of ours un|&s;een by him, there can be none, from which he is not able to deliver us. When David was for&s;aken by his father and mother, and &s;urrounded with a whole army of inhuman enemies, he &s;peaks of this as his comfort, The Lord is my light, and my &s;al|vation: whom &s;hall I fear? The Lord is the &s;trength of my life: of whom &s;hall I be afraid?

<P>I ACKNOWLEDGE there is &s;omething peculiarly delightful in the company of a wi&s;e, a pious, and an indulgent parent; and I doubt not, but many of us can ea&s;ily recollect it.

We had not only the manly plea&s;ure of rational conver&s;e, but there was a mixture of reverence and of grati|tude in our hearts, which much increa&s;ed the delight. We were a&s;&s;ured of their candour towards their chil|dren, and their prejudice in favour of what we might &s;ay; and that in&s;pired us with &s;pirit and cheerful|ne&s;s. We were encouraged to attempt to plea&s;e them, becau&s;e we concluded we might ea&s;ily do it&punc; and the &s;en&s;e we had of the &s;uperiority on their parts, made every expre&s;&s;ion of their kindne&s;s &s;o much the more &s;weet and obliging.</P>

<P N="1">1. LET us thankfully acknowledge the gracious provi&s;ion which God has made to &s;upport his people under the lo&s;s of parents and friends.</P>
<P>WE &s;hould ble&s;s his name, that he does not leave us to &s;ink under the burden; or at be&s;t to collect &s;ome uncertain comfort from the precarious conclu|&s;ions of our una&s;&s;i&s;ted rea&s;on; but that, through the blood and righteou&s;ne&s;s of his &s;on, he has giv|en his plain and expre&s;s promi&s;e for the encou|ragement of &s;uch incon&s;iderable and unde&s;erving creatures.</P>
<P>YOU, who&s;e parents are living, ought to be thankful, that God hath provided &s;uch reviving cordials for you again&s;t the mournful time when they may be taken away.</P>
<P>AND we, who have lo&s;t our parents, and have found relief in our extremities, from &s;uch decla|rations as the&s;e, &s;hould recollect it with plea&s;ure, and often repeat our &s;ongs of grateful acknowledge|ment.</P>
<P>AND I will farther add, we ought not only to rejoice and to be thankful on our own account, but al&s;o on account of tho&s;e afflicted friends who may receive &s;upport from &s;uch &s;trong con&s;olations. We pity children that have lo&s;t their parents, and it is delightful to &s;ee other generous per&s;ons ri&s;ing up to take care of the orphans, and in &s;ome re&s;pect to make up their lo&s;s. But how much more de|lightful

it &s;hould be to us, to hear an Almighty God proclaiming him&s;elf as their great guardian, and &s;aying, that when their father and their mother for|&s;ake them, he will graciou&s;ly take them up.

He &s;upplied the breaches that he had made, and by a train of providence, which we cannot but admire in the review, rai&s;ed up other friends for us; and, it may be, in&s;pired al|mo&s;t with the tenderne&s;s of parents, per&s;ons, who were ever unknown to us, when the la&s;t of our pa|rents was taken away. Nay, perhaps, &s;ome of us may &s;ay, that the death of a valuable parent, which we feared would be our ruin, has proved, in &s;ome of its then unthought of con&s;equences, on the whole, a very great mercy to us.</P>

<P>THE words of the text are the pathetic lament|ation of good old David, on the death of Ab&s;a|lom; a favourite, but wicked &s;on.

virtuous and holy di&s;po&s;itions of &s;oul, the corre&s;|ponding beauties of the mind. But the&s;e hopes were dreadfully di&s;appointed; for the darling, the beautiful Ab&s;alom, proved a murderer and a rebel; he went in unto his father's concubines, in the &s;ight of all I&s;rael<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. xvi. 22.</NOTE>, and openly attempted to take away the life of him, from whom his own was derived, and by who&s;e indulgence it had been &s;pared, even when forfeited to ju&s;tice. Yet neverthele&s;s David had &s;uch paternal tenderne&s;s, as, under all the&s;e cry|ing provocations, expre&s;sly to order the generals of his army, to deal gently with the young man Ab&s;a|lom, for his &s;ake<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">2 Sam xviii. 5.</NOTE>. But the righteous venge|ance of God determined it otherwi&s;e, and, not with|&s;tanding all his father's fond precautions, brought him down to the grave with infamy and blood. He was &s;natched away by a violent and very terrible death, in the prime of his days, and the very act of his &s;in; and this was the occa&s;ion of tho&s;e mov|ing words, O my &s;on, Ab&s;alom, my &s;on, my &s;on, Ab&s;alom!

<P>WE may charitably, and I think very rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, that they are not only the expre&s;&s;ions of David's natural affection, on the death of a &s;on whom he tenderly loved; but that they aro&s;e from the views of that &s;tate on which he entered by death, which mu&s;t certainly be very dreadful; &s;o dreadful, that David, who&s;e eternal intere&s;ts were secure<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">y the promi&s;es of an everla&s;ting covenant, would have been willing even by his own death to have deliver|ed him from &s;uch complete and &s;uch hopele&s;s ru|in.</P>

<P>PARENTS are apt to flatter them&s;elves with fond hopes from their infant-offspring; they look upon them as the blo&s;&s;oms of future delight and &s;up|port. They comfort them&s;elves under the other burdens of life, and the additional cares and la|bours which a growing family brings upon them, by looking forward to future years, and anticipat|ing the plea&s;ures hereafter to ari&s;e from the duty, gratitude, and u&s;efulne&s;s of their children. <Q>But alas! will the good may &s;ay, Could I have &s;een what this poor creature would have proved in&s;tead of rejoicing in his birth, I &s;hould have mourned over it as a calamity to me and my fami|ly.

to communicate to him: I urged them &s;eriou&s;ly upon him; I frequently reminded him of them; and, to &s;upply the defects of my per&s;onal in&s;tructi|ons, I put the book of God into his hands, and engaged him in an early and con&s;tant attendance on public ordinances. When I &s;aw him wander|ing in the paths of folly and &s;in, I endeavoured to convince him of the fatal con&s;equences of &s;uch cour&s;es, and in the mo&s;t affectionate manner to di&s;&s;uade him from them.

And when he comes to make the enquiry, what will the i&s;&s;ue be? Will my &s;on accu&s;e me? Or mu&s;t I be a witne&s;s again&s;t him?

II. I PROCEED to draw &s;ome inferences from the &s;ad &s;urvey we have been taking, of the pious pa|rent's reflections on the death of a wicked child. And hence we may infer,</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT wicked children are acting a very cru|el and unnatural part, while they are expo&s;|ing their pious parents to &s;uch reflections as the&s;e.</P>
<P>I SAY it with a &s;orrowful heart, but &s;o it is, that I fear there are &s;everal of you, my young friends, who live in the neglect of your own &s;ouls, and who&s;e con&s;ciences will pre&s;ently charge it upon you. How &s;oon that awful being, whom you now for|get, may cut off the number of your months in the mid&s;t<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Job xxi. 21.</NOTE>, and add you to the number of the dead, you know not; but this is certain, that if you die as you live, and your parents &s;urvive the &s;troke, they will feel the weight of the&s;e terrible reflecti|ons; and even now they cannot but fear them. Doubtle&s;s, if they be pre&s;ent here their hearts are bleeding whil&s;t I &s;peak, and they are looking upon you with unknown angui&s;h. And does not the thought grieve you, and does it not &s;hame you? Ungrateful creatures! are the&s;e your returns for all their bounty for all their tenderne&s;s; to be a &s;word in their bowels, and to pierce their very hearts? Alas, they did not expect &s;uch &s;cenes as the&s;e, when you hung about them with your infant arms; when you an&s;wered their fond &s;miles, and li&s;ped out the fir&s;t broken accents of endearment. I wonder how you can bear the thought! I wonder you are not a&s;hamed to be conver&s;ing with them daily, and dai|ly receiving new favours from them; while you are behaving in &s;uch a manner, that, the better they
<PB N="158" REF="046736_0153_1021F4FB01D4FE80">
love you, the more they mu&s;t be afflicted and terri|fied for you. Oh, that you would have compa&s;|&s;ion on them! or, if this will not move you, oh that you would have compa&s;&s;ion on your&s;elves! for your own intere&s;t is &s;till much more nearly con|cerned than theirs. Which leads me to add,</P>
<P N="2">2. WE <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> farther infer, that a dreadful coun|terpart to tho&s;e reflections will be the portion of the ungodly child.</P>
<P>ALAS, &s;inners, if your pious parents weep thus for you, how bitterly will you weep for your&s;elves! for if the&s;e things be done in a green tree, what will be done in the dry<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Luke xxiii. 28, 31.</NOTE>! if they, the children of God, perhaps even then under the &s;miles of their heavenly father, and in the near views of their own complete &s;alvation, may utter their griefs in &s;uch melting accents, what agonies will take hold of your hearts, when you are actually entered on tho&s;e &s;eats of horror and de&s;pair, to which the righteous vengeance of God has doomed you? It is impo&s;&s;ible fully to de&s;cribe them; yet &s;omething relating to them we may certainly infer from what has been already &s;aid. Give me leave to offer it to your view, if peradventure, through the agency of divine grace, to have heard of the&s;e reflections may be the happy means of leading you to e&s;cape them.</P>
<P>YOUR parents may reflect <Q>on the di&s;appoint|ment of their expectations from you:</Q> But oh, how heavy will the di&s;appointment of your own hopes and expectations then &s;it upon your &s;ouls! how will you then bear it, &s;inners, when you &s;ee all

your enjoyments, and all your pro&s;pects bla&s;ted in a moment, and irrecoverably lo&s;t?</P>
<P>IT is true, you are lifting up your &s;ouls unto vanity<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. xxiv. 4.</NOTE>; but the&s;e vanities are your all. You pur&s;ue them with the utmo&s;t vigour and inten&s;ene&s;s of mind, and have a great many fond and chimeri|cal &s;chemes for years of plea&s;ure and happine&s;s yet to come. But if God cut you off in the prime of your life, and in the very flower of your hopes, in that day all your thoughts will peri&s;h<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. cxlvi. 4.</NOTE>. And how will you be confounded to &s;ee all the beauti|ful and enchanted &s;cenes that now charm you to the neglect of God and religion, vani&s;h like the &s;ha|dowy glories of a dream, and your &s;ouls left nak|ed and de&s;titute upon an inho&s;pitable &s;hore, where, in all your indigence and di&s;tre&s;s, there will be no eye to pity you, no hand to relieve you!</P>
<P>AND it will be &s;o much the more dreadful, as you will go down to the&s;e melancholy regions with your appetites and your pa&s;&s;ions warm about you, and by frequent indulgence &s;trengthened and inflamed; &s;o that, for want of their proper objects, they will prey upon your heart, and an in&s;atiable thir&s;t will continue, while you will not have one drop of &s;a|ti&s;faction or comfort. Nay, I may add, that as, in the&s;e unripened days, you have had little experi|ence of the vanities and di&s;appointments of life, and have entertained a great many fond and extra|vagant hopes of what you would never have found in it, your regret, in being cut off from them, will not be in proportion to what they really were, but to what your error and folly imagined them to have been.</P>

THIS, I &s;ay, appears to be the evident meaning of the&s;e words. And that for this plain rea&s;on; that &s;ome of the phra&s;es made u&s;e of, are &s;uch as are never taken in a good &s;en&s;e, and therefore can|not admit the former interpretation. Solomon doth indeed, as you have heard, exhort his readers to eat and drink, and enjoy the good of their la|bours; but where can you find him, or any other &s;acred writer, exhorting or allowing men to walk in the way of their heart, and in the &s;ight of their eyes? I am &s;ure, that phra&s;e generally &s;ignifies an indulgence to the irregularities of appetite and pa&s;|&s;ion, in the neglect of rea&s;on and of &s;cripture. Thus the I&s;raelites are charged to wear fringes on their garments<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Numb. xv. 39.</NOTE>, that they might remember all the commandments of the Lord, and do them; and might not &s;eek after their own heart, and their own eyes; that is, (as it follows,) that they might not go a whoring from God after tho&s;e gay and luxu|rious idolatries, which regaled the &s;en&s;es, while they debauched the &s;oul. And thus the wicked I&s;raelite, whom God would &s;eparate to evil out of all the tribes, is repre&s;ented as vainly and arrogant|ly &s;aying<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">De<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t xxix. 19.</NOTE>, I &s;hall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart: (that is, as it fol|lows,) to add drunkene&s;s to thir&s;t, or one riot to another.

To the&s;e general remarks on the u&s;ual &s;ignification of the phra&s;es occuring here, we may al&s;o farther add, that the connection of the&s;e words would lead us to under&s;tand them as an ironical rather than a &s;erious conce&s;&s;ion, &s;ince they conclude with what &s;eems a very awful menace.

<P>THE text abundantly intimates the importance of tho&s;e con&s;iderations, which are taken from the final judgment. Now it is certain, the go&s;pel di&s;|covers this in the &s;tronge&s;t light. Therein is the

In the go&s;pel, we are not only told in general, that God will judge the world in righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, but particularly a&s;&s;ured, that he will do it by that man whom he hath appointed<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Acts xvii. 11.</NOTE>, even the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who for that purpo&s;e &s;hall de&s;cend from heaven, in his own glory, and the glory of the father, and all the holy angels with him<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Mat. xvi. 27. xxv. 21.</NOTE>; that the trumpet &s;hall found, and the dead &s;hall be rai&s;ed<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xv. 52.</NOTE>; that &s;mall and great &s;hall &s;tand before God<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Rev. xx. 12.</NOTE>; while in the mean time the world is in flames around them, the &s;un being darkened, and the moon not giving her light<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">k xiii. 24</NOTE>, the &s;tars falling<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxiv. 29.</NOTE>, the heavens pa&s;&s;ing away with a great noi&s;e, the elements melting with fervent heat, the earth with all things in it being burnt up<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">2 pet. iii. 10.</NOTE>, and de|parting out of its place<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Rev. xx. 11.</NOTE>. And can any thing be more awakening and awful than all this pomp of horror, this conflagration and confu&s;ion of nature? Yes, &s;irs, there is one thing yet more awakening; and it is that which the go&s;pel expre&s;sly pronoun|ces, that, in con&s;equence of all, the wicked &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment, and the righte|ous into life eternal<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t. xxv. 46.</NOTE>.

<P>NOR mu&s;t I by any means omit that grand ad|vantage which the go&s;pel gives us in the&s;e addre&s;&s;|es, by the di&s;covery of the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us under the character of a Saviour. It di&s;plays him as the chief among ten thou&s;and, and altogether lovely; as inviting, as waiting, as pleading, as weeping over &s;inners, yea, as bleeding and dying for them: as de&s;cribing the terrors of judgment, that he may awaken them to &s;lee from it, and may gather them, as a hen gathers her chickens under its compa&s;&s;ion|ate protecting wings<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxiii. 37</NOTE>. But is this a &s;imile that we may u&s;e, when &s;peaking of him who is to ap|pear under the character of <Q>the worthy judge eternal?</Q> Yes, my friends, low as it may &s;eem, it is a &s;imile that he him&s;elf u&s;es, and perhaps u&s;es it in part; it is &s;o low, that the language it&s;elf may be a &s;pecimen of that conde&s;cen&s;ion which it is in|tended to expre&s;s.</P>
