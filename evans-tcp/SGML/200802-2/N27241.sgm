<P>I certify you brethren, that the Go&s;pel which was preached of me, is not after man&mdash;but by the revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ST. PAUL begins this epi&s;tle with a very intere&s;t|ing &s;alutation, "Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who gave him&s;elf a ran&s;om for our &s;ins, that he might deliver us from this pre&s;ent evil world, accord|ing to the will of God and our Father&mdash;to whom be glory forever amen." This introduction has particu|lar reference to the occa&s;ion of his writing, which was, to &s;ugge&s;t to the Galatians that they had not kept the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. "I marvel that ye are &s;o &s;oon removed from him that called you into the grace of Chri&s;t, unto another go&s;pel." And al&s;o to call back their minds to the &s;implicity, purity, and truth, of that go&s;pel which had been delivered them by Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles. "Tho' we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other go&s;pel unto you than that we have preached, let him be accur&s;ed." He then makes an appeal to his manner of preaching, in
<PB N="4" REF="036313_0004_1008E5DF076C2968">
which without fear or flattery, he had &s;et forth the character, office, and atonement of Chri&s;t. "Do I now per&s;uade men, or God? Or do I &s;eek to plea&s;e men?" And further, he calls them to witne&s;s that he had preached to them the true go&s;pel&mdash;"I certify you, brethren, that the go&s;pel which was preached of me is not after man&mdash;but by the revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t." How important is it, e&s;pecially in this day of religious darkne&s;s, that every mini&s;ter of the go&s;|pel &s;hould be able to &s;ay he has preached no other go&s;|pel, but that of Chri&s;t! That he has not received his doctrines, from the commandments of men, nor framed his go&s;pel, after the rudiments of the world; but that he has learnt it after Chri&s;t! That he has not &s;hunned to declare the whole council of God. Alas! How much greater rea&s;on, than the apo&s;tle, have they to &s;ay who is &s;ufficient for the&s;e things!</P>
<P>The &s;ubject naturally leads us,</P>
<P N="1">I. To recollect what we have received as the go&s;pel, and where it is to be found.</P>
<P N="2">II. To enquire whether we have received the true go&s;pel.</P>
<P N="3">III. To &s;how in what re&s;pects, this &s;ubject applies to us, and what u&s;e may be made of the application.</P>
<P N="1">I. What have we received as the go&s;pel? and where is it to be found?</P>
<P>We have received the following things, as con&s;ti|tuting that holy &s;y&s;tem of faith, di&s;cipline, and prac|tice, which is contained in the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="1">1. The eternal exi&s;tence, and infinite perfections, of one only living and true God; who is the author of all things; the alone fountain of truth, ju&s;tice, mercy, and happine&s;s. Who&s;e character is exhibited to us in three per&s;ons, the father, who is the &s;ource; the &s;on, who is the mini&s;ter; and the holy gho&s;t, who is the efficient of divine grace.</P>
<P N="2">2. God made all things for his own glory, and the good of his creatures. The&s;e are his ultimate ends; therefore, even the wrath of man, &s;hall prai&s;e him;
<PB N="5" REF="036313_0005_1008E5C9673717D0">
and the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible good, &s;hall be the final i&s;&s;ue of all his operations.</P>
<P N="3">3. Man was created originally upright; but he has fallen from this &s;tate, on the trial of our fir&s;t pa|rents, and lo&s;t communion with God; is prone to evil, and from the nece&s;&s;ity of his natural inclinations, grows up into a &s;tate of &s;in; the full wages of which, is death temporal, &s;piritual, and eternal.</P>
<P N="4">4. God has entered into a covenant with his &s;on, to &s;ave man in a way of grace, and on this purpo&s;e, Chri&s;t has come in the fle&s;h&mdash;has made an atonement for &s;in&mdash;explained the conditions of the covenant of grace; and promi&s;ed &s;alvation to tho&s;e who comply with them. We are therefore ju&s;tified, through faith in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t; who has honored the law of God, and opened the way for the return of &s;inners, to the great author of life and goodne&s;s, from whom they have departed; and in a manner, equally well adapted to their &s;ituation, and to the honor of the univer&s;al governor. Therefore&mdash;</P>
<P N="5">5. Evangelical faith, implies not only a belief in Chri&s;t, as the Me&s;&s;iah; but a true repentance of &s;in; and a conver&s;ion to holine&s;s, by a divine operation of the &s;pirit of God, in the means of grace&mdash;producing in order, faith, repentance, tru&s;t in God, love of Chri&s;t, and general, though not perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s of character.</P>
<P N="6">6. Though chri&s;tians are not perfect in this life; yet all, who truly believe in Chri&s;t, are &s;ealed by vir|tue of the new covenant, unto eternal &s;alvation; and have the promi&s;e of God, that they &s;hall not fall away, &s;o as finally to loo&s;e the ble&s;&s;ings of redemption.</P>
<P N="7">7. There will be a re&s;urrection of the dead, both of the righteous and the wicked, to a righteous judg|ment of God, where, each one will appear in his own character, and an&s;wer for him&s;elf; and they will be &s;entenced re&s;pectively, to everla&s;ting mi&s;ery, and ever|la&s;ting happine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="036313_0006_1008E5E165AFC038">The&s;e are the principal doctrines, which we have received, as contained in the go&s;pel; laying the main &s;tre&s;s, on the great atonement, the awful depravity and &s;piritual death of unbelievers, and the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of regeneration to holine&s;s, through faith, repentance, and &s;anctification.</P>
<P>With no le&s;s reverence, have we received the &s;ab|bath, and &s;acraments, as of chri&s;tian and apo&s;tolic in|&s;titution. Believing, that the &s;abbath is to be ob&s;er|ved as holy time; devoted to the &s;ervice of God, and the &s;piritual good of our &s;ouls&mdash;That bapti&s;m is to be received, as a &s;ign, or &s;eal of our covenant rela|tion to God, and the church&mdash;that all baptized chil|dren, are branches or members of the church; and are to be treated as &s;uch, until admitted to open per|&s;onal &s;tanding; by having taken their infant covenant vows upon them&s;elves, in a public profe&s;&s;ion, that they believe in Chri&s;t, and are his di&s;ciples.</P>
<P>That the Lord's &s;upper, is a confirming, as bap|ti&s;m, is an initiatory &s;eal, of the chri&s;tian covenant&mdash; that it is de&s;igned to collect the followers of Chri&s;t; to &s;upport their friend&s;hip, and quicken their graces: and that all, who are in open, per&s;onal &s;tanding, in the church, have a right to partake of it. That all baptized children, of &s;uitable age, are to be called on, to own or renounce, their faith in Chri&s;t, into whom they have been baptized; that they may be dealt with accordingly, and that all who have named Chri&s;t, &s;hould depart from iniquity, and feel the mo&s;t &s;olemn obligations, to watch over each other, in the &s;pirit of charity, communion, and di&s;cipline.</P>
<P N="2">II. We are now led to enquire, whether we have received the true go&s;pel.</P>
<P>From the great variety of opinions held by chri&s;|tians, it would &s;eem, their charity mu&s;t be very wide|ly extended; as there is no denomination, which is a &s;tandard for all the re&s;t&mdash;con&s;equently, that they ought to be &s;u&s;picious of them&s;elves. Notwith&s;tand|ing, we may doubtle&s;s, have &s;atisfactory evidence,
<PB N="7" REF="036313_0007_1008E5CC1AF1C038">
that we have received the e&s;&s;ential truth of the go&s;pel; and perhaps may find, that we have &s;ome advantage, in point of orthodoxy, over other denominations of chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>To prove that we have received the go&s;pel, not on|ly in its mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential &s;en&s;e, but even its faire&s;t form, &s;everal things will be di&s;tinctly mentioned.</P>
<P N="1">1. We have taken no man, or body of men, for our guide. We derive all our authority in di&s;cipline, the articles of our faith, and the rules of our conduct, &s;olely from the &s;criptures. And we have derived them, without the fear of man, or the prejudice of opinion. With the &s;criptures open before us, we have gone to the great fountain of light and grace, in prayer; and we tru&s;t, he has given us &s;ome proper &s;en&s;e of his go&s;pel.</P>
<P N="2">2. The principal doctrines of our go&s;pel, appear to be e&s;&s;ential parts of the chri&s;tian &s;cheme. They are like pillars, and foundation &s;tones, in the building, which removed, the &s;uper&s;tructure mu&s;t fall. They are &s;uch, as we &s;hould expect would be plainly &s;poken of, and clearly marked, on the very face of the go&s;|pel. Can we open our bibles, without meeting with the depravity of man, the atonement of Chri&s;t, the nece&s;&s;ity of regeneration, the re&s;urrection of the dead, and the judgment of the world by our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t?</P>
<P>Take away any of the&s;e doctrines; and &s;ee how the go&s;pel will &s;tand. If you remove the atonement, in what will the go&s;pel differ, from the morals of Zoroa&s;ter, Socrates, or Seneca? except, that it is the be&s;t &s;y&s;tem of morality which can be found? Remove this, and you deny the depravity of man, the nece&s;&s;ity of re|generation, and a future judgment.</P>
<P>The &s;ame may be &s;aid, of any other con&s;tituent part of the go&s;pel. If you deny depravity, you ren|der regeneration unnece&s;&s;ary; and the atonement be|comes ab&s;urd&mdash;deny regeneration; and Chri&s;t would be the mini&s;ter of &s;in&mdash;deny the re&s;urrection of
<PB N="8" REF="036313_0008_1008E5E372CF2FD8">
the dead, and a future judgment; and religion will be licentiou&s;ne&s;s; and the whole moral government of God will be de&s;troyed. They who hold the&s;e doc|trines, and tho&s;e nece&s;&s;arily attached to them, mu&s;t be e&s;&s;entially right. And if all others are con&s;idered as une&s;&s;ential opinions, in which men agree, or differ, according to the prejudice of education, the tempera|ment of the pa&s;&s;ions, or the advantages of enquiry; we &s;hall, perhaps, &s;tand &s;o much the fairer chance, to receive the light of philo&s;ophy, while we are &s;olemnly impre&s;&s;ed, with the awful my&s;tery of the go&s;pel; and may breathe the &s;pirit of benevolence and charity, while we are earne&s;tly contending for the faith, once delivered to the &s;aints.</P>
<P>This may, in general, be &s;aid of the churches in this country. It is our endeavour, to hold fa&s;t the e&s;|&s;ential truths of the go&s;pel, with a charitable and lib|eral temper, towards tho&s;e who differ from us in the une&s;&s;entials of religion.</P>
<P N="3">3. We, my brethren, in particular, have been care|ful to avoid extremes of opinion, or practice, into which &s;ome have gone. In &s;upporting the divine &s;ove|reignty, we have not made God the author of &s;in. We have held the awful depravity and death of the &s;inner, without denying the u&s;e of means. In terms of com|munion, we have not &s;uffered our&s;elves to be exalted, above the claims of an imperfect, probationary, and militant church.</P>
<P>On the other hand, we have not denied the gov|ernment of God. We have not made Chri&s;t the mere mini&s;ter of grace; by repre&s;enting man, as working out his own matter of ju&s;tification. We have not &s;eparated the means and in&s;truments of grace, from their Almighty agent. Nor have we opened the bo|&s;om of the church, to every intruder. It has been our endeavour, to gather into the church, the &s;incere enquirers after truth, and the humble followers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t: forming our judgment, on the rectitude
<PB N="9" REF="036313_0009_1008E5CE30D0CF98">
of their lives, and the &s;pirituality of their conver&s;a|tion.</P>
<P N="4">4. Another argument in our favour, my brethren, is the &s;implicity of our &s;cheme. This mark of truth, has always di&s;tingui&s;hed it, from the affectation and ob&s;curity of fal&s;ehood. Our &s;y&s;tem, without the corruptions of the bea&s;t, the additions of the fal&s;e prophet, or the deceitful workings of the dragon, has been e&s;&s;entially the faith of the orthodox church, thro' all changes of chri&s;tianity&mdash;the &s;tandard, from which erroneous di&s;&s;enters, &s;peculative believers, met|aphy&s;ical doctors, and a&s;&s;uming popes, have varied; and to which the reformed have con&s;tantly returned. It is &s;uch, as to its plainne&s;s, purity, and power, as the great divine teacher would inculcate&mdash;&s;uch, as fi&s;hermen could under&s;tand, and men of all capacities receive. It is a &s;tructure, which in the light of eigh|teen hundred, di&s;covers no di&s;proportion, to the mo&s;t di&s;cerning eye. It &s;hows, more clearly than ever, its divine original. It does not, like the image of Ne|buchadnezzar, manife&s;t un&s;ound materials; but with pyramidal &s;trength, it &s;ecurely rears its lofty head to heaven; and bids defiance to the rage of man, the arts of Satan, and the wa&s;te of time.</P>
<P N="5">5. We cannot help mentioning, the tendency of our faith, to unite and &s;trengthen the church of Chri&s;t. It removes the fir&s;t occa&s;ion for controver&s;y and di&s;&s;en|tion; by &s;etting none&s;&s;entials in their proper place, and by addre&s;&s;ing it&s;elf to the plaine&s;t under&s;tanding. When the con&s;tituent parts of the go&s;pel, are candid|ly explained, and judiciou&s;ly &s;ettled, all capacities may under&s;tand it, and unite in it, who are not e&s;&s;entially defective in religious experience.</P>
<P>My predece&s;&s;or<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. NATHAN STRONG.</NOTE> was an eminently wi&s;e and good man, who&s;e long, and &s;ucce&s;sful labours, are yet in ble&s;&s;ed memory, with you who have been wit|ne&s;&s;es of his mini&s;try. He was well acquainted with
<PB N="10" REF="036313_0010_1008E5E548869E00">
the oil and compo&s;ition of the &s;anctuary. He gave you the go&s;pel in its &s;implicity; without exciting you to controver&s;y, or lulling you into apathy. Adapting the great e&s;&s;ential practical truths of religion, he ex|plained them without affectation, and held them with|out wavering. His venerable example, I have, with &s;hort &s;teps, and feeble exertions, endeavored to fol|low. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, there has been a great har|mony in the &s;entiments of this church; which I pray God may continue, for your peace and love in the Lord Je&s;us. May you neither degenerate into care|le&s;&s;ne&s;s of what you believe and profe&s;s; nor fall into contentions on circum&s;tantial and &s;peculative &s;ubjects; as if Chri&s;t was to be divided, between Paul and Bar|nabas. How much is Chri&s;t di&s;honoured, by &s;aying I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas. Alas! How far, from the proper &s;pirit of tho&s;e, who are all profe&s;&s;edly one in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; of whom the whole family, in heaven and earth, is named!</P>
<P N="6">6. The la&s;t thing I &s;hall mention, in confirmation of our go&s;pel, is the manife&s;tation of its power in the conver&s;ion of &s;inners. The work of grace has &s;hown us, that the articles of our faith are from God. We find them deeply impre&s;&s;ed on the minds, of all tho&s;e who are born again to a lively &s;en&s;e of the truth, and of their need of Chri&s;t. They have been convinced of the evil of &s;in. They have &s;een the value and wonder of the atonement. They have felt the awful terrors of judgment upon the impenitent&mdash; the ju&s;tice of God in them; and the nece&s;&s;ity of be|ing reconciled to him from a new heart and life. And when they have been able to take hold of the new covenant, they have evangelically repented of &s;in. They have admired the grace of the go&s;pel; and have expre&s;&s;ed their joy in prayer, for divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and in prai&s;e to God and the Lamb, for bringing &s;al|vation to a guilty world. We may add, the &s;pirit of the Lord who beareth witne&s;s with our &s;pirits, hath taught us that our go&s;pel is the wi&s;dom of God, and
<PB N="11" REF="036313_0011_1008E5D3030E2678">
the power of God. Many of us, who were once dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins, hope we have been quickened in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, unto that new, and holy life, with|out which no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;uch &s;trong and indubitable features of divine truth, as give us the highe&s;t evidence, that we have received the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t in &s;implicity.</P>
<P>Having con&s;idered what we have received as the go&s;pel; and whether we have received the true go&s;|pel, we proceed&mdash;</P>
<P N="3">III. To enquire how this &s;ubject applies to us; and what u&s;e may be made of the application.</P>
<P>Our &s;ituation, is &s;imilar to that of tho&s;e mentioned in the text. I was called by the providence of God, to preach the go&s;pel to you, as the apo&s;tle had done to the Galatians; and am now &s;eparated from you, as he was from them. I ought to be able to call you to witne&s;s, "that the go&s;pel which was preached of me, is not after man&mdash;but by the revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t." And you ought to be able, to bear te&s;timo|ny for your&s;elves, that you have received it as it is in Je&s;us. For if it &s;olemnly concerns me, to know whether I have been faithful to declare the whole coun|&s;el of God; the enquiry is equally intere&s;ting to you, whether you have heard the will of God, and been careful to obey it.</P>
<P>Let us, therefore, more particularly attend to the u&s;e, which may be made of this &s;ubject, in applica|tion to our&s;elves.</P>
<P N="1">1. If this &s;ubject has convinced you, that your go&s;pel is the truth, how important is it, that you &s;hould pre&s;erve it from tho&s;e innovations, which tend to its corruption. Innovations there are, my breth|ren, which have this tendency. You are already un|der cen&s;ure, by tho&s;e who affect a purer church. Her|e&s;y and orthodoxy, I am &s;en&s;ible, are a mere <HI>vice ver&s;a,</HI> in the mouths of different parties, like the <HI>meum and tuum</HI> of commerce. But you will feel the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;tanding on your guard, when you con&s;ider, that
<PB N="12" REF="036313_0012_1008E5E7D72DF9A8">
the charge of here&s;y is one of tho&s;e excitements, which the bea&s;t has u&s;ed, to make the world wonder after him. I &s;incerely hope, you will not become a prey; either to tho&s;e daring metaphy&s;icians and pre|&s;umptuous innovaters, who&s;e object, like that of French politicians, will be to revolutionize, or divide and ruin you; or to tho&s;e preying morali&s;ts, who&s;e preaching would harden you into &s;tone, or convert you into di&s;ciples of "illuminated" morality.</P>
<P N="2">2. This &s;ubject &s;ugge&s;ts to our minds, that &s;tate of man, which gives occa&s;ion for preaching the go&s;pel. The fir&s;t notion of the go&s;pel, carries the idea of an aw|ful depravity. If man was not in &s;uch a &s;tate, &s;o great preparations for his return to God, would not only be unnece&s;&s;ary; but they would be ab&s;urd, and prepo&s;|terous, as coming from infinite wi&s;dom. It is becau&s;e this truth is not felt, that the preaching of the go&s;pel, is an offence to the Jews, and fooli&s;hne&s;s to the Greeks. A &s;en&s;e of our depravity, makes the go&s;pel appear to be the wi&s;dom of God, and the power of God. If I have not inculcated this great truth, I have neglected an e&s;&s;ential part of the council of heaven&mdash;You have not yet been taught the occa&s;ion of Chri&s;t's coming. Or if I have preached this doctrine, and you have not heard, you have had no &s;en&s;e of the holine&s;s of the law again&s;t which you have &s;inned. You have not learnt that the law is before the go&s;pel; nor felt that the wages of &s;in is death. Con&s;equently, you have &s;een no beauty in the go&s;pel &s;y&s;tem, nor any need of the atonement of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. We are led to con&s;ider, what is the de&s;ign of the go&s;pel. It is not merely to &s;how us our condition, as &s;inners, who have lo&s;t the communion and favor of God: it carries a much nobler idea. By convin|cing man of &s;in, it de&s;igns to di&s;play the character of God; who manife&s;ts him&s;elf, not only a being of righteou&s;ne&s;s and truth, but of benevolence and mercy&mdash;a being, who takes no delight in afflicting his creatures, even with a &s;en&s;e of their own wretch|edne&s;s
<PB N="13" REF="036313_0013_1008E5D4917AF1F0">
by &s;in. Who&s;e love is &s;uch, that he has open|ed a way for &s;inners, thro' the &s;acrifice of his own &s;on; by whom the honor of the law is re&s;tored; and means prepared, thro' which, by divine grace work|ing in them, we might have the &s;pirit of adoption, and be able to u&s;e the natural language of children who have never gone a&s;tray. "Our father who art in heaven; may thy kingdom come; work in us that which is well plea&s;ing in thy &s;ight; and finally may we be admitted into thy pre&s;ence without &s;pot, thro' the merits of the Lord Je&s;us, to the prai&s;e of thy grace."</P>
<P N="4">4. Hence we may &s;ee in what character, we are to receive the preachers of the go&s;pel. They are to be received; not as morali&s;ts; not as philo&s;ophical rea|&s;oners; not as public orators and critics; but as &s;er|vants of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;ent, to make known the will of God in the my&s;tery of grace&mdash;who are to take oc|ca&s;ion from the terrors of the law, and the conviction of &s;in, to &s;how the coming and glory of Chri&s;t; and to lead &s;inners to embrace his go&s;pel; that they may honor, both the ju&s;tice and mercy of God; in their return; and enjoy him forever. Therefore &s;ays the great apo&s;tle, "We preach not our&s;elves, but Chri&s;t Je&s;us the Lord, and our&s;elves your &s;ervants, for Je&s;us' &s;ake."</P>
<P>If the&s;e things are true, how inconceivably &s;olemn, is the preaching of the go&s;pel! The mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t &s;hould be able, in the language of St. Paul to the Galatians, to call God to witne&s;s for them.&mdash; "Behold, before God, I lie not." They have com|mitted to them, the un&s;earchable riches of Chri&s;t&mdash; they come to their hearers on an angels' errand; to tell them their &s;ituation; and to &s;how them what God has done in Chri&s;t for their &s;alvation&mdash;to convince them of the irrecoverable lo&s;s of tho&s;e that die impenitent; to make them flee for their lives to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as to an ark of &s;afety, and city of refuge, from the aven|ger of blood&mdash;to per&s;uade them, if po&s;&s;ible, to lay
<PB N="14" REF="036313_0014_1008E5E965EAA658">
hold on the hope &s;et before them, which, like an an|chor entering within the vail, will finally conduct them to the embraces of him, who is the author and fini&s;h|er of faith; and into the pre&s;ence of God, where is fullne&s;s of joy.</P>
<P>How very far then, is that unruly, carping di&s;po|&s;ition, which is often exerci&s;ed toward mini&s;ters, from the &s;pirit of &s;erious and candid hearers of the go&s;pel! Mini&s;ters are, indeed, &s;inful and imperfect men; but God has &s;een fit to commit this trea&s;ure un|to earthen ve&s;&s;els, that the excellency of its power, above what we &s;hould expect from &s;uch in&s;truments, might be of him who worketh all things, according to the coun&s;el of his will. You remember the words of our Saviour to his apo&s;tles, "who&s;oever receiveth you, receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that &s;ent me." Mo&s;t people hear the go&s;pel as if it was not addre&s;&s;ed to them&s;elves, but to their neigh|bours; or rather, as if the preacher was &s;etting forth a &s;cheme of &s;alvation, for the inhabitants of Jupiter or Saturn. They do not &s;eem &s;o much as to think, that he is a me&s;&s;enger from God, to &s;how them the danger of their &s;ituation, and call them to repentance. How dreadful, my hearers, will be the &s;ituation of unfaithful mini&s;ters, who have &s;hunned to declare the whole coun&s;el of God, and &s;uffered &s;inners to peri&s;h without warning! And how much le&s;s awful, will be their condition, who have come to de&s;truction, ha|ving de&s;pi&s;ed privileges, &s;inned again&s;t warnings, and trodden under foot the Son of God&mdash;to whom, after having rejected the go&s;pel of peace, even with God, the fountain of mercy, there remaineth no more &s;ac|rifice for &s;in.</P>
<P N="5">5. The occa&s;ion and the &s;ubject unite, in calling our minds to that &s;olemn relation, which &s;hortly &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted between us, but now is no more.</P>
<P>Have I not preached to you the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, in plainne&s;s and &s;olemnity? Have I not dwelt on its mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential doctrines? Have I not &s;hewn you the
<PB REF="036313_0015_1008E5D7278B4698">
danger of continuing in &s;in; and the nece&s;&s;ity of be|ing born again to a new and holy life? Have I not pointed out the la&s;t &s;tate of the impenitent&mdash;that of your&s;elves you cannot come to God; and if you could, that he could not receive you without a Saviour? In view of the&s;e truths, have I not led you to Chri&s;t, as the only way, the truth, and the life&mdash;as to an all-&s;ufficient Saviour, the &s;on of God, who is able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t, all that come unto God through him? He has gone before us, through the &s;ufferings of per&s;ecution, and the agonies of death, to that re&s;|urrection, from the grave, which will &s;hortly pre&s;ent all his followers, with immortal glory, into the pre|&s;ence of his father, and our father.</P>
<P>Let me a&s;k you, my hearers, how you have im|proved the&s;e truths? If I have been unfaithful, will it &s;ave you from giving your own account to God? But I am permitted this day to call you to witne&s;s that I have preached to you the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t; and de|clared the coun&s;el of God. By the mercy of God I have one more opportunity, at lea&s;t, to deliver my own &s;oul; by warning you not to put far away the evil day&mdash;to repent of your &s;ins&mdash;to accept of Chri&s;t, and turn unto God; while it is your accepted time, and your day of &s;alvation. And I mu&s;t, by no means, forget &s;o to warn you, and you mu&s;t be care|ful &s;o to improve, what you have heard from me, that we may not be afraid to &s;ee each others faces, a|mong the many millions, who will &s;hortly be a&s;&s;em|bled before the bar of God, to hear their doom. God is witne&s;s to the truths you have now heard, and to all you ever heard. He hath given you a con&s;cience of the&s;e things, that he might not leave him&s;elf with|out witne&s;s of his ju&s;tice, in condemning tho&s;e who will not obey his go&s;pel. May you, who are yet im|penitent, be awakened before it is too late; and God is able to convince you of &s;in, of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and judgment. If you are ever awakened you will &s;ee, that the truths I have taught you are real, and inter|e&s;ting.
<PB N="16" REF="036313_0016_1008E5ED03E8F618">
Doubtle&s;s your con&s;ciences now tell you I have &s;poken the truth. But hark! If the &s;oft whi&s;|pers of con&s;cience, even in tho&s;e who are carele&s;s and &s;ecure are thus articulate, how loud mu&s;t be her thunders, to the awakened &s;inner, who &s;tands in full view of the law, at the very foot of Sinai in flames, and hears di&s;tinctly the Almighty condemnation.&mdash; Alas! Who will be able to endure the &s;entence of final judgment, which will &s;oon be pa&s;&s;ed, upon all tho&s;e who know not God, and obey not the go&s;pel of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>May we all find mercy in the day of the Lord Je|&s;us. May the &s;pirit of all truth, guide us now we are &s;eparated. I a&s;k an intere&s;t in your prayers, that whether I continue in the work of the mini&s;try, or not, God would lead me into the path of wi&s;dom, duty, and peace. My prevailing inclination has been not to leave the mini&s;try; altho' my rea&s;ons for it are weighty, as many of you are &s;en&s;ible. May the Lord give you another pa&s;tor, more after his own heart, who &s;hall keep you from being &s;cattered upon the mountains of I&s;rael; and feed you with the bread of life. The Lord forgive you, and ble&s;s you; and make us all &s;o happy, as to meet in that land of promi&s;e, who&s;e rivers flow with perpetual plea&s;ure from the throne of God; and who&s;e fruits are con|&s;tant and uncea&s;ing. Here the life of the &s;aints is immortal&mdash;&s;ociety is perfect&mdash;love and righteou&s;ne&s;s exclude contention&mdash;joys are unmingled with &s;or|rows, and friends are never &s;eparated.</P>
<P>That this may be our portion, may God grant, thro' him who hath loved us and given him&s;elf for us&mdash;to him be glory, dominion, and prai&s;e. AMEN.</P>
