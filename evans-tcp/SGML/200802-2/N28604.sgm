<Q><BIBL><HI>PSALM XXXIX, 5th.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Verily every man at his be&s;t &s;tate is altogether vanity.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE words in glowing colours de&s;cribe the debility of man. Man who was made in the image of his Maker, lord of the lower creation, and formed to future exi&s;tence, is vain as the vapour, nay, in his be&s;t &s;tate is altogether vanity. This truth is forcible in application to man in the highe&s;t degree of human glory. Diver&s;ity of circum&s;tance, though in other re&s;pects it may precede diver&s;ity of con&s;equence, yet here, makes no difference between the judge on the bench, and the culprit at the bar, the victor in triumph, and the vanqui&s;hed in de&s;pair, the king on his throne and the beggar at the gate. The text is conceived in the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive language. <HI>Verily,</HI> is a term fre|quently u&s;ed by the be&s;t in&s;tructor, and mo&s;t accurate judge of human language. It is employed to &s;ub&s;tan|tiate the truth beyond contradiction. When our Lord u&s;hers in a declaration with "verily, verily I &s;ay unto you" all ground of doubt is in&s;tantly removed. Such an introduction more than invites prevailing opinion, it lays &s;pecial claim to unbounded confidence: It de|mands the a&s;&s;ent of judgment in &s;uch a manner, as to exclude the de&s;ire of other evidence. Thus, with the in&s;pired penman of the p&s;alm from which our text is cho&s;en. This &s;ingle word from him is more deci&s;ive than a thou&s;and arguments from rea&s;on without the guidance of in&s;piration. The former is cloathed with divine authority, while the latter, like the &s;ource whence they proceed are often delu&s;ive.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="038117_0005_100FCDD91492C4F8">HAVING furni&s;hed &s;uch ground of confidence, the p&s;almi&s;t proceeds to a de&s;cription, which applies to the human race without exception: The fir&s;t and the la&s;t, the greate&s;t and the lea&s;t are equally implicated. However the different gradations of human life may exhibit men in different attitudes of pur&s;uit, employ|ment and enjoyment; yet a perfect coincidence is formed by the deep in&s;cription of vanity on all. And le&s;t we entertain the apprehen&s;ion, that great men may be vain, in &s;uch in&s;tances only, wherein, even <HI>they</HI> are &s;ometimes unwi&s;e, the text circum&s;cribes our contem|plation by the narrow limits of this mo&s;t happy and pro&s;perous condition. The be&s;t and mo&s;t happy &s;tate of man, in exclu&s;ion of every con&s;ideration le&s;s de&s;ir|able, invites our meditation. And even here, a veil is drawn over all his greatne&s;s. Here, he is not parti|ally vain; but vanity in the ab&s;tract.</P>
<P>IF the &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions of our text, were indulged by the licen&s;e of poets, and if for that rea&s;on, the plain and literal meaning of the terms may not be admitted; yet, the pa&s;&s;age is full of in&s;truction, and demands our mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration; and &s;eldom, if ever, more than the pre&s;ent &s;olemn, and &s;orrowful occa&s;ion, an occa&s;ion, originating from an event in which the citiz|ens of America are deeply intere&s;ted: For Wa&s;hington the great is not able to continue by rea&s;on of death. Wa&s;hington, the father of his country, the defender of her rights, the protector of millions, is no more! He, who frowned on tyrants, and bade boundle&s;s ambition &s;ubmit to the mild mandates of liberty and law, has fallen, greatly fallen, in unequal combat with the king of terrors. He, who bore no di&s;tant re&s;emblance to the wi&s;e king of I&s;rael, in circum&s;tances of ea&s;e, and affluence at home, at his country's call, for&s;ook dome&s;tic endearments, and in jeopardy of life, entering the high places of the field, engaged in a conte&s;t, which, though righteous in it&s;elf, was however dubious in event, and pregnant with danger, and death, in all the dreadful
<PB N="7" REF="038117_0006_100FCDDA9695C8B8">
forms of retribution to reputed rebels. That man, who by the &s;acrifice of his property and gratuitous devotedne&s;s of his time and talents, to the cau&s;e of his country, who, by the wi&s;dom of his coun&s;els, and prow|e&s;s of his arms, gathered lawrels of renown, which &s;hall continue with unfading lu&s;tre to the late&s;t po&s;|terity, who commanded the proud kings of the ea&s;t "to be &s;till, and they obeyed him." Wa&s;hington, the boa&s;t of America, the dread of tyrants, and the envy of the world, has, in the cour&s;e of divine providence, furni&s;hed a &s;triking illu&s;tration of our text, "verily, every man at his be&s;t &s;tate is altogether vanity."</P>
<P>Two que&s;tions are &s;ugge&s;ted by this text for con|&s;ideration.</P>
<P N="1">I. What is the be&s;t &s;tate of man?</P>
<P N="2">II. Why is mere vanity predicated of man in &s;uch a &s;tate?</P>
<P N="1">1. WHAT is the be&s;t &s;tate of man? Different &s;tates are preferred according to the different ta&s;te or reli&s;h of &s;uch as make the preference: But the real goodne&s;s of a &s;tate depends not on opinion. It is founded on the original rule of right, and like that remains unal|terable. The be&s;t &s;tate of man, is that wherein he can enjoy the highe&s;t and mo&s;t permanent felicity. A rational mind without enjoyment is unavoidably mi&s;er|able. Intire de&s;titution of plea&s;ure, and pain when unbia&s;&s;ed rea&s;on excites reflection is ab&s;olutely impo&s;|&s;ible. Heaven and hell cannot be realized with indif|ference. The &s;ubject is too &s;erious to admit of trifling. Eternal joy and endle&s;s woe, by the nece&s;&s;ity of our nature, afford happine&s;s or mi&s;ery in the contempla|tion: But mi&s;ery is not an object to be cho&s;en. Di&s;|intere&s;ted malevolence has no exi&s;tence. Enjoyment is therefore in&s;eparable from the be&s;t &s;tate of man. And by how much the more refined and permanent the enjoyment is, by &s;o much the more de&s;irable the &s;tate of the happy &s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="038117_0007_100FCDDE19550BE0">BUT the concurrence of &s;everal things, is e&s;&s;ential to &s;uch enjoyment.</P>
<P N="1">1. A clear and lively apprehen&s;ion of truth. The propriety of this remark, depends not on the complex|ion of your creed. Whether chri&s;tian or pagan, the ob&s;ervation &s;till remains. Nothing within the limits of pure revelation, and ab&s;olute athei&s;m can furni&s;h an exception. Diver&s;ity of opinion, cannot produce &s;ub|&s;tantial joy, from unfounded &s;y&s;tems. Ignorance in|deed, may flatter a deluded con&s;cience to the joyful &s;ubver&s;ion of right and wrong, but all that &s;eeming happine&s;s, which re&s;ults from ignorance, will in&s;tantly vani&s;h in the light of truth. Hay and &s;tubble, may better endure devouring flame, than fal&s;e joys abide the breath of his mouth, and the brightne&s;s of his ap|pearing, who is truth it&s;elf. Idle dreams may delude the hungry, but wakeful reflection will &s;ub&s;tantiate his mi&s;ery. Many will be repul&s;ed with the argument in their mouth "have we not prophe&s;ied in thy name and in thy name done many wonderful works." Clear conviction will detect the guilt of apprehending, that we may do God &s;ervice by the &s;laughter of his friends. St. Paul is not the only illu&s;tration of this truth. The hope of thou&s;ands has been &s;lain by the light of law, and thou&s;ands yet unborn will happily experience the &s;ame death. "This is life eternal to know Thee the only true God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom thou ha&s;t &s;ent. Except ye believe that I am he ye &s;hall die in your &s;ins."</P>
<P>But 2d. Such enjoyment requires communion in happine&s;s. The highe&s;t and mo&s;t permanent felicity, is not &s;elfi&s;h and mercenary. It re&s;ults not from partial pro&s;perity in oppo&s;ition to general enjoyment. Bene|volence, which is the &s;ource of the mo&s;t high, refined, and permanent gratification, is without partiality. It is utterly a &s;tranger to private or &s;ini&s;ter views. It knows no confinement within the exten&s;ive limits of the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible felicity. Soaring above the highe&s;t
<PB N="9" REF="038117_0008_100FCDE14AA49430">
exertion of partial affection the &s;ubject of benevolence is lo&s;t in the boundle&s;s ocean of infinite delight. To contemplate the &s;olid and &s;ub&s;tantial plea&s;ure of others, will cau&s;e the good man to &s;ing for joy. Dictated by the temper of his own heart he knows to weep with tho&s;e who weep, and to rejoice with &s;uch as do rejoice. The plea&s;ure which &s;uch enjoy in communicating happine&s;s where it is within their power, and rejoicing in that ble&s;&s;edne&s;s which is infinitely above them, is the &s;pring of every benevolent exertion. But for this, what motive to action which the enlightened con&s;cience can approve? What virtue in drudging like an ox, in hard and laborious exertion, in reprobation of general felicity? For approbation or reprobation of this great object is e&s;&s;ential to every moral exerci&s;e. Here a &s;tate of neutrality is utterly unknown. "He that is not with me is again&s;t me," is the declaration of him who taught as never man did.</P>
<P>"GLORY to God in the highe&s;t, peace on earth, and good will to man," is the genuine expre&s;&s;ion of true benevolence, and not confined to &s;uch, as were edu|cated in heaven. The ardent flame is caught in the brea&s;t of &s;ome below; its fervour is felt, and &s;een in effu&s;ions of a &s;imilar nature. Job, in his own vindica|tion, replies to the reproachful language of his friends.</P>
<P>If I have withholden the poor from his de&s;ire, or have cau&s;ed the eyes of the widow to fail, or have eaten my mor&s;el by my&s;elf alone, and the fatherle&s;s have not eaten thereof.</P>
<P>If I have &s;een any peri&s;h for want of cloathing, or have &s;een the poor without covering.</P>
<P>If his loins have not ble&s;&s;ed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my &s;heep.</P>
<P>If I have lift my hand again&s;t the fatherle&s;s.</P>
<P>Then let my arm fall from my &s;houlderblade and let my arm be broken from the bone.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="038117_0009_100FCDE46A71E7E0">BUT the p&s;almi&s;t has de&s;cribed the &s;ame temper in language if po&s;&s;ible &s;till more expre&s;&s;ive. "If I forget thee O Jeru&s;alem; let my right hand forget her cun|ning. If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, if I prefer not Jeru&s;alem above my chief joy."</P>
<P>THIS affection, like a bond of union, cementing every inhabitant of the be&s;t &s;tate of man, opens a &s;ource of joy which is un&s;peakable and full of glory. Com|plete gratification of all &s;uch de&s;ires is the natural, and nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence. They en&s;tamp on the &s;ubject the moral image of the great Creator, and God will fulfil the de&s;ires of &s;uch as fear him. Nor is it po&s;&s;ible for Omnipotence to do otherwi&s;e unle&s;s the unchange|able put on mutability.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE highe&s;t and mo&s;t permanent enjoyment is progre&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>IF the powers of the human mind are capable of progre&s;&s;ion, in knowledge, benevolence, and enjoy|ments, that &s;tate mu&s;t be preferable to all others, where &s;uch progre&s;&s;ion is en&s;ured. But that the mind is thus capable, has never been denied. Here, an opponent is not apprehended. Everla&s;ting forget|fulne&s;s, the la&s;t re&s;ort of boa&s;ted, but blinded rea&s;on, &s;hould the dream be realized, can furni&s;h no objection to advances in felicity, while con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s may endure. The deci&s;ion of the re&s;t, falls not within the pre&s;ent field. It will be clearly &s;een in the light of the general judgment. The appeal lies, to that awful tribunal. To the real chri&s;tian, progre&s;&s;ive information, and in|crea&s;ing enjoyment, are mo&s;t animating con&s;iderations. His views extend beyond the narrow limits of human life, and contemplate ages, in unnumbered millions, rolling on from high to higher gradations of perfect enjoyment; attended in each progre&s;&s;ive &s;tep, with retrogade motion in deep aba&s;ement. The objects
<PB N="11" REF="038117_0010_100FCDE7B5A6C978">
which give him plea&s;ure &s;hall remain forever, and in his apprehen&s;ion, like the ri&s;ing light, &s;hine brighter and brighter, in endle&s;s day. "Ble&s;&s;ed are the pure in heart for they &s;hall &s;ee God." To &s;uch a mind, enjoyment will ever keep pace with increa&s;ing inform|ation, the heart will no longer maintain warfare with the under&s;tanding. The will, and affections will from a perfect coincidence with the enlightened dictates of con&s;cience, and the &s;oul, like the mote which plays in the &s;unbeams, be lo&s;t in the immen&s;ity of divine com|placency. Every increa&s;ing de&s;ire, will be &s;atisfied in drinking of the rivers of God's plea&s;ure. Every bene|volent mind, will be filled with the fullne&s;s of God.</P>
<P>BUT has &s;uch a &s;tate ever fallen to the lot of man? Where is the chart of the happy country? What the terms of naturalization, and how &s;hall admittance to the new Jeru&s;alem be procured?</P>
<P>WE cheerfully reply, that the exi&s;tence of &s;uch a &s;tate, is clearly de&s;cribed by the infallible pen of divine in&s;piration. Nor, is it a work of difficulty to a&s;certain the terms of admittance. The right of citizen&s;hip is offered "without money and without price." "The &s;pirit and the bride &s;ay come, and let him who heareth &s;ay come, and who&s;oever will let him come and take of the waters of life freely." Hungering for the bread, and thir&s;ting for the waters of life, are the only pre|requi&s;ites to entering the gates into the holy city.</P>
<P>ADMITTANCE however will not be granted, to &s;uch as de&s;ire to purloin their ma&s;ter's goods, or embezzle his property. Here, "the thief breaks not through to &s;teal:" But one of two rea&s;ons can induce the wi&s;h to go to heaven, the one to &s;erve God, and the other to be &s;erved of him. But whether &s;hall I be God's &s;ervant, or &s;hall he be mine, are que&s;tions not le&s;s re|mote than heaven and hell, nor is there a greater re&s;em|blance in the tempers whence they proceed. He only
<PB N="12" REF="038117_0011_100FCDEADBA6CFC8">
who "hateth his life for Chri&s;t's &s;ake &s;hall find it:" When the eye becomes &s;ingle, then, and not till then, in that proportion, and no other, can the body be full of light. We "cannot &s;erve two ma&s;ters." A reli&s;h of heart for that enjoyment which re&s;ults from unre|&s;erved devotedne&s;s to God, prepares the &s;oul to partici|pate in the joy of its Lord, and that to a degree which eye hath not &s;een, ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive. Happy are they, who are in &s;uch a ca&s;e, yea happy, is that man who&s;e God is the Lord. But "man in his be&s;t &s;tate is alto|gether vanity."</P>
<P N="2">II. Why is vanity predicated of man in &s;uch a &s;tate?</P>
<P N="1">1. BECAUSE he is a creature. Creatures in their highe&s;t exaltation po&s;&s;e&s;s a derived exi&s;tence, and have no claim either to its mode or continuance. The power which made is able to de&s;troy. The mo&s;t dig|nified of Adam's race, if reduced to the mo&s;t abject &s;tate, would &s;uffer no injury at the hand of his maker. But, vanity is deeply in&s;cribed on that man who is kept not by any thing in the nature of his exi&s;tence, but by mighty power, from con&s;tant vici&s;itude.</P>
<P>But 2. EVERY man in his be&s;t &s;tate is altogether vanity, becau&s;e wholly dependent. Dependence is the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of creation. A creator, depend|ent on his creatures, is not a greater &s;oleci&s;m, than creatures, independent of the creator. Created exi&s;t|ence mu&s;t have a beginning, and for that rea&s;on mu&s;t be dependent. The dependence of creatures, extends through every part and period of their exi&s;tence. The laws of nature which regulate the whole, are no other, than e&s;tabli&s;hed modes of con&s;tant, divine operation, whereby the God of nature, upholds and governs all.</P>
<Q><L>"By his own power were all things made,</L>
<L>By him &s;upported all things &s;tand,</L>
<L>He is the whole creation's head,</L>
<L>And angels fly at his command."</L></Q>
<P><PB N="13" REF="038117_0012_100FCDEC6EE73B90">"HAVE ye not known? Have ye not heard, hath it not been told you from the beginning, have ye not un|der&s;tood from the foundation of the earth? It is he that &s;itteth on the circle of the earth and the inhabitants thereof are as gra&s;shoppers, that &s;tretcheth out the hea|vens as a curtain and &s;preadeth them, as a tent to dwell in&mdash;that bringeth the princes to nothing, yea that mak|eth the judges of the earth as vanity." The depend|ence of man for intelligence, and other powers of moral action, has &s;eldom, if ever been denied. "Who hath made thee to differ from another? and what ha&s;t thou which thou ha&s;t not received?" are que&s;tions, which on other ground, will admit of no reply. But becau&s;e in the exerci&s;e of mental powers, men are &s;ubjects of prai&s;e or blame, many &s;uppo&s;e the independent exer|tion of &s;elf-determining power, to be ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary. To wave the difficulty of a&s;certaining preci&s;ely, what is meant by &s;elf-determining power, we are led to &s;uppo&s;e that &s;uch power never did, and never will exi&s;t in heaven or on earth. Nor can we conceive that any advantage could be derived, from its exi&s;tence. For the exertion of &s;uch power mu&s;t either be, or not be, under the direction of the will. If it <HI>be</HI> under the direction of the will, then the will governs the power, and not the power the will. In this ca&s;e, the exertion of the power would be the effect, and not the cau&s;e, of previous volition. One act of the will has therefore already taken place without the aid of &s;elf-determining power. It remains for others to &s;how why &s;ucceeding actions may not exi&s;t in the &s;ame manner. But if on the other hand, the power of &s;elf-determination, be not under the direction of the will, it can add nothing to the freedom of human volition.</P>
<P>FOR the effect, is nece&s;&s;arily under the control of the cau&s;e, and not the cau&s;e of the effect. And is &s;uch control con&s;i&s;tent with free volition? Where then is the objection again&s;t the doctrine of nece&s;&s;ity? In the former ca&s;e, what is the re&s;pect in which, the exi&s;tence
<PB N="14" REF="038117_0013_100FCDEF61853128">
of &s;uch a power, would be advantageous? And what, in the latter, not mi&s;chievous? Is control by a power, di&s;tinct from intelligence, and will, and con&s;cience, preferable, to the government of infinite benevolence? As this will not be pretended man is a free, but con|trolled agent, acting when acted upon, and therefore, required to work out his own &s;alvation with fear and trembling; for it is God who worketh in him to will and to do of his own good plea&s;ure. Every man there|fore, in his be&s;t &s;tate is altogether vanity. He is the clay. God is the potter. For the king's heart is in God's hand, and he turneth it whither&s;oever he will, as the rivers of water are turned. All nations are before him as nothing, and they are counted by him le&s;s than nothing, and vanity. But the text has been mi&s;re|pre&s;ented.</P>
<P>THE in&s;pired writer had no reference to the moral character, and future &s;tate of man. The riches and vain plea&s;ures of time are vain, and for this rea&s;on every man in his be&s;t &s;tate is altogether vanity. Be it &s;o.</P>
<P>THIS objection, if admitted, will &s;ugge&s;t the follow|ing con&s;iderations.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE be&s;t &s;tate of man is &s;till that wherein he may enjoy the highe&s;t, and mo&s;t permanent felicity. The rea&s;on already a&s;&s;igned, will apply to this con&s;truction, with equal propriety. A lower &s;tate of enjoyment can no more claim the preference to an higher, than a &s;tate of mi&s;ery to them both.</P>
<P N="2">2, SUCH enjoyments vary, according to the infinite variety of human pa&s;&s;ions and appetites. The &s;ame objects will afford both plea&s;ure and pain, to minds of different complexions, and even to the &s;ame mind, under different circum&s;tances. The veteran hero may exult in triumph, while the tender mother, and helple&s;s orphan are filled with angui&s;h, in confu&s;ed noi&s;e of

battle and garments rolled in blood. The plea&s;ures of philo&s;ophic inve&s;tigation may feed the &s;oul of Newton, but fami&s;h the painful de&s;ires of &s;en&s;ual delight. The &s;ublime plea&s;ure of liberal donation, to cau&s;e the wid|ow's heart to &s;ing for joy, and pour the balm of con&s;o|lation on the wounded brea&s;t, puts the &s;ordid mi&s;er on the rack. The groanings of the pri&s;oner, are mu&s;ic to the tyrant; but plant a dagger in the bo&s;om of com|pa&s;&s;ion. Ambition lugs a heavy load, where &s;ober rea|&s;on finds his element. Mordecai mourns while Haman triumphs. Avarice &s;tarves in rich abundance, while prodigality riots in lawle&s;s profu&s;ion. Jarring pa&s;|&s;ions, in endle&s;s variety, exclude all rule of univer&s;al pre&s;cription. The be&s;t &s;tate of man however, on this con&s;truction will, probably, depend much on the fol|lowing circum&s;tances. A &s;trong and penetrating mind, furni&s;hed with exten&s;ive information, a firm con&s;titu|tion, enlivened with the vigour of youth, affluent fortune under the direction of a generous heart, courteous con|de&s;cen&s;ion, in exalted &s;tation, undaunted courage, and a &s;tupid con&s;cience&punc; the united influence of the&s;e, may rai&s;e the mind above the highe&s;t degree of animal gra|tification. Intellectual contemplation, unknown to the mo&s;t exalted brute, may refine the plea&s;ures of man, and complete his greatne&s;s. But here the application of our text meets no re&s;i&s;tance. Every man in his be&s;t &s;tate is altogether vanity. For,</P>
<P N="1">1. HE &s;till remains a creature, and therefore depend|ent. Behold they are all vanity, their work is vain. Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie, to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity. The in&s;trument in the hand of the workman is far le&s;s vain, than the mo&s;t ex|alted man, in the hand of his maker. The &s;aw is no more dependent than the man who &s;haketh it.</P>
<P N="2">2. VANITY is in&s;cribed on the be&s;t &s;tate of man, becau&s;e he is of ye&s;terday and knows nothing. The

<P>THE boa&s;ted information of man, however in &s;ome re&s;pect exten&s;ive, yet in others, is confined by very nar|row limits. The highe&s;t attainments in the knowledge of former things, leave man profoundly ignorant of the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>ASIDE from objects of faith, a very few facts fall within his acquaintance, and even the&s;e &s;o involved in my&s;tery, as to baffle all attempts at explanation. The deepe&s;t re&s;earches have not di&s;clo&s;ed the hidden e&s;&s;ence of a fly. The party-coloured leaf of a tulip, puts hu|man wi&s;dom at defiance, not le&s;s than endle&s;s duration. The a&s;cent of vapor, and falling of a &s;hower, &s;ubmit not to the inve&s;tigation of man. Philo&s;ophic &s;cience is baffled in the di&s;&s;ection of a mite&punc; the vegetation of a plant, derides the rea&s;on of the great, and teaches boa&s;ted wi&s;dom to learn her weakne&s;s. But if pre&s;ent objects elude the mo&s;t accurate re&s;earches of indefatig|able application, how much more the future? Hete|rogeneous operations concur, to &s;ub&s;tantiate that &s;y&s;tem, which will unfold with increa&s;ing magnitude to eternity. The growth of an hair, the fall of a &s;parrow are con|&s;tituent parts, not le&s;s e&s;&s;ential than the ri&s;e and fall of empires.</P>
<P>NOTHING is made in vain. The &s;traying of an a&s;s, prepares the way for Saul the &s;on of Ki&s;h to be anointed king over I&s;rael. Childi&s;h dreams led on to mo&s;t &s;tupendous &s;cenes; which, illu&s;trating the faithfulne&s;s of God, and di&s;playing the riches of his grace, may excite the exclamation, "all the&s;e things are again&s;t

me;" while pride, and envy &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all bounds, in the rapid progre&s;s of their ruin. Haman exults, while preparation was making for his exaltation on a gibbet.</P>
<P>WITHOUT aid of revelation, probable conjecture is the only clue to future &s;cenes; and revelation it&s;elf leaves many things unrevealed. Predictions are be&s;t expounded in the event. The time, and place, and circum&s;tances, under which we are to live and die, are to be learnt by experience. To unwind the intrica|cies of the labyrinth without the guidance of a thread, is far le&s;s difficult, than to unfold the events of the next &s;ucceeding moment, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of pro|phetic &s;cience. Boa&s;t not thy&s;elf of to-morrow, for thou knowe&s;t not what a day may bring forth.</P>
<P>BUT the un&s;table nature of terre&s;tial things puts the truth of our text, beyond the reach of contradiction. The decided voice of experience, excludes the po&s;&s;i|bility of a doubt.</P>
<P>THE beams of pro&s;perity often give place to darkne&s;s more palpable than that of Egypt. Riches make to them&s;elves wings, and reduce even the perfect man of Uz to a dunghill. The proud king of Babylon is turned out to eat gra&s;s like an ox, and Pharaoh and his ho&s;t are drowned in the red &s;ea. How &s;udden and awful the tran&s;ition! Storms of fire and brim&s;tone, on the devoted cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, were not more unexpected, and the flood might as ea&s;ily yield to re&s;i&s;tance. Vigorous youth, affluent fortune, exten|&s;ive information, exalted &s;tation, and univer&s;al e&s;teem, &s;erve to brighten the &s;cene, and render the in&s;cription &s;till more legible. How is the mighty fallen! is the momentary cry of &s;uch, as mu&s;t furni&s;h the next ex|ample, while a &s;tupid con&s;cience may admit a kind of enjoyment, which in an hour mu&s;t yield to the gnawing of that worm, which &s;hall never die.

<P>NEBUCHADNEZZAR is &s;eparated from his kingdom, and driven from men, to dwell with the bea&s;ts of the field, while the words were in his mouth, Is not this great Babylon which I have built, for the hou&s;e of the kingdom, by the might of my power, and for the honor of my maje&s;ty? Bel&s;hazzer, refu&s;ing in&s;truction from the example of his father, fell a &s;acrifice to lu&s;t of his own heart, in the night of &s;ordid indulgence. Senna|cherib found a &s;peedy, full and everla&s;ting reply to the impious enquiry, "How much le&s;s, &s;hall your God be able to deliver you out of my hand." Faithful admo|nitions of con&s;cience interpret the hand writing and realize the truth, that where much is given, much is al&s;o required.</P>
<P>A &s;en&s;e of ju&s;t retribution for abu&s;ed favor, excites the bitter lamentation "a wounded &s;pirit who can bear." The accumulated wealth of Peru, will rather enhance, than mitigate the angui&s;h. The gaudy trap|pings of the great, and impious adoration of millions reproach the unhappy man, for withholding honor from whom honor is due. Lively apprehen&s;ions of de&s;erved puni&s;hment in rapid approach, embitter the comforts of life, and &s;ometimes produce the preference of &s;tarv|ing and death.</P>
<P>DID &s;uch reflections proceed from an enthu&s;ia&s;tic heart, or di&s;tracted brain, yet the truth of our doctrine is learnt.</P>
<P N="4">4: FROM the original &s;entence, "du&s;t art thou and unto du&s;t thou &s;halt return," faithful monuments hand down to po&s;terity, the previous exi&s;tence of millions now no more. The great congregation of the dead, pro|claim

in &s;ilent, but emphatic language, that "man in his be&s;t e&s;tate is altogether vanity." The mortality of man, is &s;o clearly taught in the book of God, and ex|emplified by daily ob&s;ervation, that infidelity it&s;elf is unable to re&s;i&s;t the evidence.</P>
<P>INFIDELITY here, is but another name for the mo&s;t con&s;ummate madne&s;s. One generation pa&s;&s;eth away and another cometh, the latter &s;upplying the place of the former, in quick and &s;urpri&s;ing &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The momentary &s;tate of man, is illu&s;trated by the mo&s;t &s;trik|ing examples. The diligence of the po&s;t, the pa&s;&s;ing of the &s;hadow, the velocity of the &s;huttle, do but faintly repre&s;ent the more rapid progre&s;s of human life. Man is like unto vanity, his days are as a &s;hadow which pa&s;|&s;eth away. Lord make me to know mine end, the mea&s;ure of my days what it is, that I may know how frail I am.</P>

were conducted in &s;afe retreat to dome&s;tic enjoyments. The valor of his youth, impre&s;&s;ed a grateful country with &s;entiments of e&s;teem, which time did not obliter|ate.

<P>NEITHER modern principles of liberty and equality, nor the &s;till more unwarrantable thir&s;t of domination, formed any part of his political &s;y&s;tem.

<P>THE charms of monarchy, in his newly emancipated country, when di&s;played clearly within view, and placed fully within his reach, were rejected with a magnani|mity, I had almo&s;t &s;aid, peculiar to him&s;elf.

<P>GENERAL WASHINGTON was called to the helm of government on a boi&s;terous ocean, and tempe&s;tuous &s;ea|&s;on.
<PB N="21" REF="038117_0020_100FCE061569E348">
The admini&s;tration of a new, and untried form of government, produced complaints which many had apprehended. A decided majority, in &s;ome of the States, had rejected, while a large minority in others, had ob&s;tructed the adoption of the federal con&s;titution. The vibration of &s;ome, from liberty to licentiou&s;ne&s;s, had diffu&s;ed the &s;pirit of di&s;organization, and licen&s;ed re&s;i&s;tance to government. The &s;ame mea&s;ures, and that too from the &s;ame bodies, became the object both of petition and remon&s;trance.</P>
<P>PRESSING &s;olicitations of an oppo&s;ite nature, and from different directions, proclaimed certain de&s;truction to his country if each were not gratified&mdash;gratification of all was impo&s;&s;ible. Unavoidable di&s;appointment found the utterance of reproach. And all this, on the &s;up|po&s;ition that government, had been admini&s;tered with ab&s;olute perfection, which can hardly be admitted, while, every man in his be&s;t &s;tate is altogether vanity. But in &s;uch an important cri&s;is of public affairs, is not the man yet to be born, who could weather the &s;torm of contending pa&s;&s;ions, with more dignity to him&s;elf, or &s;afety to the public? George Wa&s;hington was made for mo&s;t important &s;ervice, has accompli&s;hed like an hireling his day, and pa&s;&s;ed from the theatre of life, to a permanent &s;tate of exi&s;tence beyond the grave. The ob&s;curity of the &s;peaker has &s;ecluded him, from &s;uch means of information as others po&s;&s;e&s;s, relative to the moral or religious character of this great man. He is authori&s;ed however, from authentic documents, to &s;ay, that General Wa&s;hington was a believer in the chri&s;tian Religion, in a &s;en&s;e which many profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tians do reject. In a circular letter to the governor of each &s;tate, at the clo&s;e of the war, we find the following re|markable words. "The free cultivation of letters, the unbounded extent of commerce, the progre&s;&s;ive refine|ment of manners, the growing liberality of &s;entiment, and above all, the pure and divine light of revelation, have had a meliorating influence on mankind, and in|crea&s;ed
<PB N="22" REF="038117_0021_100FCE08F189BF58">
the ble&s;&s;ings of &s;ociety."&mdash;And in the clo&s;e of the &s;ame letter he adds. "I now make it my earne&s;t prayer, that God would have you, and the &s;tate over which you pre&s;ide, in his holy protection, that he would incline the hearts of the citizens to cultivate a &s;pirit of &s;ubordination to government, to entertain a brotherly love and affection for one another, for their fellow citi|zens of the United States at large, and particularly for their brethren, who have &s;erved in the field; and fin|ally that he would mo&s;t graciou&s;ly be plea&s;ed, to di&s;|po&s;e us all to do ju&s;tice, to love mercy, and to demean our&s;elves with that charity, humility and pacific temper of mind, which were the characteri&s;tics of the divine author of our ble&s;&s;ed religion, without an humble imi|tation of who&s;e example, we can never be an happy nation."</P>
<P>THE example here held forth for imitation is that of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whom many others repre&s;ent as a mere creature; but General Wa&s;hington be|lieves him to be the independent and eternal God. He is the "divine Author of our ble&s;&s;ed religion." The ardent prayers that God would mo&s;t graciou&s;ly be plea&s;ed, to di&s;po&s;e us all to do ju&s;tice, love mercy and to demean our&s;elves with that charity, humility, &amp;c.&mdash; and incline our hearts to &s;ubordination to govern|ment, and brotherly love," &amp;c. clearly implies, that we are previou&s;ly di&s;inclined to &s;uch duties, that divine exertion is nece&s;&s;ary to produce the di&s;po&s;ition to per|form them, and that &s;uch exertion is not a debt which we may demand; but the gift of grace which might ju&s;tly be withholden. By grace are ye &s;aved through faith and that not of your&s;elves it is the gift of God. But the &s;criptural creed, pure moral and exten&s;ive u&s;e|fulne&s;s of the Author of this prayer, can furni&s;h no ground of ultimate reliance.</P>
