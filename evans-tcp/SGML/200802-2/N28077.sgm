</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TO be&s;tow a re&s;pectful tribute on departed worth, and to cheri&s;h the precious memory of our greate&s;t human benefactor, is the urgent duty, which our grateful and afflicted hearts now dictate and impel us to perform. The melancholy tidings of the <HI>death</HI> of Wa&s;hington, which were announced to us, the la&s;t week, call us to take a part in the af|fliction &s;o univer&s;ally felt and deplored.</P>
<P>WHILE we, with the&s;e emblems of mourning,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THE pulpit was clad in the ve&s;ture of mourning. This early notice taken by the inhabitants, of the death of the beloved WASHINGTON, is an honorable te&s;timony of their re&s;pect to his memory.</NOTE> pay a re&s;pectful tribute to his memory, and em|balm him in our hearts, it becometh us &s;uitably to notice and improve this di&s;pen&s;ation of Divine Pro|vidence

&s;o afflictive, and &s;o fruitful of in&s;truction to us all. To evince the &s;orrow we feel, in this di&s;tre&s;&s;ing event, and our readine&s;s to contribute what is in our power, in honoring the memory and perpetuating the example of this mo&s;t e&s;timable and amiable man, we &s;hall improve and apply the words before us.</P>
<P>IN all ages of the world, monuments of grati|tude and &s;ame have been rai&s;ed, and funeral ho|nors paid, to the memory of great and good men. But no one, I pre&s;ume, can be found in the records of profane hi&s;tory, who has been more truly great and good, and more de&s;erving &s;uch honorable tri|bute, than our late much loved WASHINGTON.</P>
<P>ALL, who have had ears to hear, eyes to &s;ee, under&s;tandings to comprehend, or hone&s;ty to con|fe&s;s, mu&s;t acknowledge and admire the extraordi|nary talents, the great achievements, the brilliant virtues and the benevolent &s;ervices, of the deliverer and guide of this American Nation. And if the children of I&s;real had occa&s;ion to deplore the lo&s;s of Mo&s;es, well may America weep for the death of her WASHINGTON.</P>
<P>THE text intimates the duty of paying a ju&s;t tribute to character: of &s;uitably mourning, the lo&s;s of the wi&s;e and good. The words expre&s;s the weeping and mourning, which the children of I&s;|rael manife&s;ted for the lo&s;s of their illu&s;trious lea|der. The life of Mo&s;es was continued u&s;eful and important to them even to its la&s;t hour; when <HI>he died his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.</HI></P>

HE was rai&s;ed up, to be the in&s;trument of their deliverance from Egyptian bondage, and the ap|pointed medium of their ble&s;&s;ings, as the favorite people of God, and of their pre&s;ervation as a na|tion. And as a General, Politician and Lawgiver, the world had never beheld his equal. With the enemies, they were called to encounter; in their unparalleled journey through the dreary de&s;ert; and in the admini&s;tration of their laws and govern|ment, we &s;ee Mo&s;es at their head. However vari|ous their &s;ucce&s;s, he was a &s;harer with them. He partook in their misfortunes as well as in their victories; in their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, as well as in their joy|ous intervals; in their alternate periods of depre&s;|&s;ion and elevation; and was with them through the whole &s;eries of adver&s;e and pro&s;perous events, that &s;ucce&s;&s;ively awaited them, from Egypt to Jordan, and on him devolved the re&s;pon&s;ibility of a mo&s;t &s;acred and important tru&s;t. And when he had faithfully and &s;ucce&s;sfully di&s;charged his duty, and as an in&s;trument in the hands of Jehovah, had di&s;pen&s;ed incalculable good to his countrymen, he was taken from them, at a moment, they were to enjoy the promi&s;ed and procured inheritance.&mdash;And well might they weep for him. The remem|brance of his eminent &s;ervices, and the con&s;idera|tion of the privileges and ble&s;&s;ings he had been in|&s;trumental in procuring for them, uniting there|with, the thought of the lo&s;s of their guide, mu&s;t have greatly increa&s;ed the affliction of a &s;eparation. He had become endeared to them, by every tie of obligation and gratitude, and their attachment to him was interwoven with the fir&s;t affections of their
<PB N="8" REF="037426_0006_100D40BEC19B8790">
hearts. Though his departure by death was an e|vent, they had been taught to expect; yet when they were called to realize the &s;eparation, they were greatly afflicted, <HI>they wept.</HI></P>
<P>MOSES had been forewarned of his approaching end; though he had lived to &s;ee his people enter|ing on the enjoyment of their inheritance; yet it was the decree of God, that he &s;hould not live to enjoy the inheritance with them. The period of his di&s;&s;olution now drawing nigh, and de&s;irous of taking his leave of them, in a manner corre&s;pond|ing with a life that had been devoted to their wel|fare, he a&s;&s;embled them in the plains of Moab, and there enumerated the many &s;ignal interpo&s;itions of Providence in their behalf. He al&s;o reminded them of their laws and peculiar duties, and encouraged them to per&s;everance and fidelity, with the a&s;&s;ur|ance, "that if they kept God's commandments, ble&s;&s;ings would be &s;howered down upon them, but if they neglected them, calamities would befall them." Having thus performed the various offices of his great tru&s;t, and having prepared for his na|tion, &s;ome important coun&s;els and in&s;tructions for their future conduct, as the be&s;t legacy he could leave, he then took a &s;olemn and affecting farewell of them. He then retired to the <HI>Mount,</HI> from whence he could view the promi&s;ed land and the countries round about. Uniting with his delight|ful view, the con&s;ideration of having conducted his countrymen to the enjoyment of their inheritance, he mu&s;t have enjoyed a noble, a rich reward for all his cares and labour. "He then re&s;igned his &s;oul
<PB N="9" REF="037426_0007_100D40C0F7031970">
into the hands of angels, waiting to convey it to the heavenly Canaan."</P>
<P><HI>And the Children of I&s;rael wept for Mo&s;es, in the Plains of Moab.</HI> Such were the peculiar and affecting circum&s;tances, which occa&s;ioned the&s;e words; words, which the &s;acred hi&s;torian has re|corded as commemorative of the affectionate tri|bute of a grateful people, and the funeral honors paid by them, to the memory of their guide and benefactor.</P>
<P>IN this tran&s;ient view of the character in which Mo&s;es was appointed to act and conduct as the de|liverer and leader of his nation, we &s;ee a &s;triking re&s;emblance to the part, which Wa&s;hington has per|formed, in behalf of this American I&s;rael. In hav|ing &s;uch a man as our deliverer, our guide and our head, is an exclu&s;ive privilege, which we can glory in, as the Children of I&s;rael did, "above all the other nations of the earth." As the deliverer and political &s;aviour of our nation, he has been the &s;ame to us, as Mo&s;es was to the Children of I&s;rael. He was early rai&s;ed up, by Divine Providence, to e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of freedom, to infu&s;e into our brea&s;ts the invincible love of our country&mdash;to unite us in its defence, and to become the great in&s;tru|ment of delivering us from oppre&s;&s;ion and bondage, and of giving us liberty and independence. And will it be too much for me to &s;ay, that the Ameri|can nation, with their Wa&s;hington, emancipated and made free and happy by him, &s;hall be handed down to di&s;tant po&s;terity, and perpetuated with as much fame and glory, in the annals of profane hi&s;tory, as
<PB N="10" REF="037426_0008_100D40C2A3997AC8">
the Children of I&s;rael, with their Mo&s;es, are cele|brated in the &s;acred writings.</P>
<P>VAIN and fruitle&s;s would be the attempt to exhi|bit a ju&s;t delineation of Wa&s;hington's character. In drawing it off, much of the original would be lo&s;t.</P>
<P>SUCH an a&s;&s;emblage of talents and virtues, &s;uch a coincidence of circum&s;tances and events &s;o wi&s;ely managed, &s;uch peculiar opportunities &s;o u&s;efully improved, accompanied with &s;uch invariable inte|grity, uprightne&s;s and purity of conduct, all i&s;&s;uing in &s;uch happy &s;ucce&s;s and unclouded glory&mdash;but rarely fall to the lot of man, and &s;eldom found united in the human character.</P>
<P>WHETHER we view him in the field, <HI>as the man of war,</HI> in the cabinet, <HI>as the coun&s;ellor,</HI> in the pre&s;i|dential chair as our head, or in the private walks of life, as a citizen, our admiration is equally ex|cited.</P>
<P>To determine true worth of character, however, we endeavour to a&s;certain principles and motives, as well as to notice great actions, and beneficial &s;ervices. In this point of view, the character of Wa&s;hington will bear the clo&s;e&s;t examination. Re|ligious principle, guiding di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence and true patrioti&s;m, con&s;titutes an important, and may I not &s;ay, the leading trait, in his character. As the joint influence of the&s;e, is the foundation of every thing great and good in man; &s;o it is the ba|&s;is on which the dignified and illu&s;trious character
<PB N="11" REF="037426_0009_100D40C65794B670">
of Wa&s;hington was rai&s;ed. It rendered the com|manding and influential exerci&s;e of his wonderful talents, &s;till more commanding and influential. Without religious principle, great abilities and pe|culiar opportunities are always liable to be pervert|ed to purpo&s;es of mi&s;chief; nor is there any &s;afety in committing power and tru&s;t to their management. But where religious principle is e&s;tabli&s;hed and in operation, there we may confidently look for the mo&s;t u&s;eful improvement of every talent, and the &s;tricte&s;t fidelity in the di&s;charge of every duty. The commanding and directing energy of this prin|ciple, holds a di&s;tingui&s;hed place in the &s;plendid character of Wa&s;hington, and may be compared to that of the Sun in the centre of the &s;y&s;tem, who&s;e e&s;&s;ential and con&s;tant emanations impart a benign influence, re&s;plendent lu&s;tre and glory to the whole. In him, we behold the rare union and di&s;play of unexampled calmne&s;s and magnanimity; of deep penetration and &s;ound judgment; of undaunted intrepidity and exemplary prudence; of invincible per&s;everance and watchful circum&s;pection, in the execution of mea&s;ures the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t, controul|ed and guided by a prevailing principle of piety and di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence. We behold him, making &s;ub&s;ervient to his noble de&s;igns, the com|plete government of all his pa&s;&s;ions, and every re|&s;ource within the compa&s;s of his comprehen&s;ive, di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate and di&s;cerning mind; and devoting him&s;elf to his God, to the welfare of his country, and to the good of mankind. Some have perform|ed important public &s;ervices, done great exploits, and made them&s;elves celebrated, from motives of
<PB N="12" REF="037426_0010_100D40C82062D908">
intere&s;t, pride and ambition. Honour, power, and exten&s;ion of dominion, were their governing objects. But characters formed from &s;uch views, are &s;eldom maintained or &s;upported long; the di&s;clo&s;ure of their ignoble and intere&s;ted de&s;igns, &s;ooner or later, becomes a great drawback on their real worth and fame, and tarni&s;hes all their glory.</P>
<P>EXTRAORDINARY talents, profound penetration, di&s;tingui&s;hed improvements, wealth, honour, power, or the glory of conque&s;t, do not of them&s;elves de|cide the true characters of men, nor render them the benefactors of mankind. The end, to which &s;uch peculiar advantages and opportunities are ap|plied, mu&s;t be taken into con&s;ideration. Their true e&s;timate is formed, from the principles and motives which actuate and govern them; from the objects they have in view; and from the good they actually intend, and are in&s;trumental in di&s;pen&s;ing to man|kind, by their talents, opportunities and conduct.</P>
<P>SOME, by &s;eizing a fortunate coincidence of events, and the opportunities of the moment, have put them&s;elves at the head of revolutions, from &s;elfi&s;h and per&s;onal views, to elevate them&s;elves to con&s;picuous &s;tations, and not from any regard to the cau&s;e they e&s;pou&s;e, nor to the good of mankind. Such popular leaders, void of religion, true patriot|i&s;m or humanity, have &s;pread deva&s;tation and car|nage far and wide, waded through &s;eas of blood, to the eminence they &s;ought, and have made, not merely tho&s;e they &s;ubdued, but even tho&s;e they led, the en&s;laved tributaries to their &s;en&s;uality and pow|er. Others al&s;o there have been, who performed
<PB N="13" REF="037426_0011_100D40C9B0B99648">
extraordinary &s;ervices for their fellow men, and then have exacted extraordinary compen&s;ation, either by actaual <HI>demands,</HI> or by making u&s;e of their power for the &s;ordid purpo&s;es of their own aggrandize|ment.</P>
<P>WHAT an intere&s;ting contra&s;t to the characters of &s;uch pretended patriots, is that of Wa&s;hington! How in&s;ignificant do they become, by the enviable compari&s;on! He tran&s;cends them, as the reality does the name, or the &s;ub&s;tance the &s;hadow.</P>
<P>IN this point of view, how va&s;tly does he &s;urpa&s;s even an Alexander and a Pompey, who&s;e names are &s;o celebrated in the annals of hi&s;tory. He re|&s;i&s;ted the &s;tronge&s;t temptations and allurements, that power and elevated &s;tation could po&s;&s;ibly offer. An opportunity occurred, at the clo&s;e of the revolu|tionary war, which put his integrity and patrioti&s;m to the greate&s;t te&s;t. It evinced, beyond &s;u&s;picion, the purity of his principles and motives. The im|poveri&s;hed &s;tate of the country, occa&s;ioned by the conte&s;t, rendered it impracticable to make that im|mediate compen&s;ation, which the &s;ervices of the brave officers and &s;oldiers de&s;erved; di&s;&s;atisfaction con&s;equently aro&s;e, and a propo&s;ition was made, not to di&s;band till their demands were &s;atisfactorily requited.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That the revolutionary army were prevailed on, peaceably to di&s;|band and retire, is to be attributed principally to the per&s;ua&s;ive &s;olicita|tions of General Wa&s;hington.</NOTE> Enjoying the unbounded confidence of the people, whom he had delivered, and having, at plea&s;ure, the entire controul and direction of the views of the revolutionary army, Wa&s;hington was
<PB N="14" REF="037426_0012_100D40CC30FB65F0">
pre&s;ented with the opportunity, accompanied by every allurement, to make him&s;elf Sovereign of Empire, without even the appearance of u&s;urpation. The di&s;po&s;al of his country was then completely in his power. Others, who&s;e military career had not been &s;o glorious, and who&s;e temptations were not &s;o fa&s;cinating, have, at &s;uch a moment, u&s;urped the reins of government, a&s;&s;umed the right of requital and e&s;tabli&s;hed their own power and authority.</P>
<P>BUT power, in the hands of Wa&s;hington, was &s;afe <HI>He</HI> could employ it for no other purpo&s;e, but to defend the rights and liberties he had vindicated; <HI>he</HI> could devote it only to the welfare of his coun|try.</P>
<P>How nobly great does he appear, in ri&s;ing &s;upe|rior to &s;uch temptations! Di&s;playing &s;uch an ex|ample of piety, &s;elf-government, integrity, patriot|i&s;m and benevolence, his character &s;tands unrivalled. After he had conquered his enemy, he could gain a &s;till greater victory, by conquering him&s;elf, and not permitting tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions of human nature, which &s;o commonly &s;tain the characters of con|querors and heroes, to have the lea&s;t influence over him. He thereby acquired additional glory to his character, in having exemplified the truth, that <HI>He that is &s;low to anger is better than the mighty, and be that ruleth his &s;pirit, than he that taketh a city.</HI></P>
<P>WITH a dignity and noblene&s;s of mind, better conceived than de&s;cribed, he returned the power and commi&s;&s;ion, with which he had been intru&s;ted; declining compen&s;ation for any part of his &s;ervices,
<PB N="15" REF="037426_0013_100D40CFE70384B0">
he retired, "refulgent in glory," to the private walks of life, a citizen with other citizens; and converting his military implements to the u&s;es of hu&s;bandry, he cheri&s;hed the hope that he &s;hould have no occa&s;ion to learn war any more.</P>
<P>WHILE, my brethren, we are thus viewing the principles and motives, which &s;o evidently govern|ed our beloved Wa&s;hington, and which greatly en|hance the worth of his illu&s;trious character; do not tho&s;e peculiar &s;en&s;ations return, which were excited in many of your brea&s;ts towards him, from the be|ginning to the clo&s;e of the war? To whom, but to him, were your expectations directed, in the doubt|ful events of the year 1775?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Amid the de&s;pondency occa&s;ioned by the lo&s;s of the brave General <HI>Warren,</HI> who was killed in the battle of Bunker Hill, Wa&s;hington's ap|pointment and acceptance of Commander in Chief, revived and &s;u&s;tain|ed the hopes of America.</NOTE> Amid&s;t the various &s;ucce&s;s that attended the whole conte&s;t, through the cour&s;e of &s;even years, was not the pre&s;ervation of the invaluable life of your Leader, the object of your unremitting &s;olicitude and your mo&s;t earne&s;t prayer? That he jeoparded his life in the fields of battle, for the &s;alvation of his country; that he performed many warlike achievements; that he de|feated all the de&s;igns of a formidable foe: and com|pletely re&s;cued and e&s;tabli&s;hed your rights, are circum&s;tances known and familiar to you.</P>
<P>AND verily he was rai&s;ed up, by the providence of God, to be our deliverer and leader: and in calling to mind the many important events, that have taken place, for twenty-five years pa&s;t, events
<PB N="16" REF="037426_0014_100D40D1AB7B0AE0">
that have contributed to lay the foundation and fini&s;h the &s;uper&s;tructure of the American Republic, Wa&s;hington is the fir&s;t and principal per&s;onage that meets our view, and claims our gratitude. "Our guide in war, our head in peace."</P>
<P>AND what&punc; my brethren, but a true and ardent love of country induced him to be among the fir&s;t, in the vindication of our liberties, and the foremo&s;t to meet a powerful enemy, with unequal, and then unorganized troops, amid&s;t countle&s;s di&s;courage|ments, difficulties and dangers; and to forego thereby, the ea&s;e and enjoyment, which opulence and the tranquil abode of private life, were calcu|lated to be&s;tow?&mdash;But e&s;pecially having accom|pli&s;hed our independence and peace, covered with glory and grey in &s;ervice, what, but the welfare of his country, and that love for it, which &s;till glowed in his brea&s;t, could have recalled him, once and again,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was twice cho&s;en Pre&s;ident&mdash;fir&s;t in 1789, and re-elected in 1793.</NOTE> from his peaceful retreat, to accept the Pre&s;idency of our confederate Republic, and to &s;u&s;|tain the weight and unu&s;ual cares of government, in a mo&s;t critical and difficult juncture of affairs.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">During his admini&s;tration, war with the Indians broke out; and al&s;o new difficulties aro&s;e in con&s;equence of the European conte&s;t.

His farewell was accompanied, like that of Mo&s;es to the Children of I&s;rael, with the be&s;t legacy that "the father of his country could leave." It contains &s;uch coun&s;el and advice, as cannot be read too often, nor trea&s;ured up and practi&s;ed with too much care. "They are the advice and di&s;in|tere&s;ted warnings of a parting friend, who could have no per&s;onal motives to bias his coun&s;el."

The di&s;ea&s;e, which arre&s;ted him, was an inflammatory fore throat, and which, in the cour&s;e of twen|ty four hours, terminated his life, on the 14th Dec. 1799, AEt. 68.</P>
<P>He was a native of America, and born in We&s;tmoreland county, in Virginia, Feb. 22, 1732.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>IT becometh us, my hearers, to cheri&s;h his pre|cious memory with gratitude and affection, and to conduct our&s;elves in a manner, that would comport with his wi&s;hes, was his life &s;pared and continued to us. Could we&mdash;But alas! Wa&s;hington is dead! What unu&s;ual &s;adne&s;s has it already &s;pread through every heart! What gloom, over every countenance! What mourning, throughout our land! <HI>My father! The chariot of I&s;|rael, and the hor&s;emen thereof!</HI></P>
<P>ILLUSTRIOUS &s;hade! If the country, thou ha&s;t &s;aved, has &s;till any &s;hare in thy regard, or in any way can yet receive thy care or influence, let all her councils, mea&s;ures and conduct be &s;uch as thy wi&s;dom would dictate, and thy prudence guide. <HI>She</HI> now offers thee, the la&s;t tribute of honour and gratitude, for thy long ince&s;&s;ant toil, care and labor. Though we can no more repair to thee, for guid|ance in the hour of danger, nor thou&mdash;come to our relief, "to &s;natch us from impending fate," to &s;ave our land from &s;ervitude, to lead our armies to vic|tory, and by thy &s;kilful hand to conduct our nation in the a&s;cending grades of pro&s;perity and glory; yet the &s;ons of America will never cea&s;e to revere thy memory, to pre&s;erve the grateful recollection of thy

benevolent and heroic deeds, to imitate thy virtues and to perpetuate thy character and achievements from generation to generation!</P>
<P>THE pa&s;t &s;ubject, in connection with this melan|choly event, teaches us that the death of great and good men is an occa&s;ion of deep mourning and la|mentation to mankind, but e&s;pecially to the people, to whom &s;uch characters were more immediately u&s;eful and important.</P>
<P>THE Children of I&s;rael mourned for their guide, they <HI>wept for Mo&s;es in the plains of Moab.</HI> And great was the lo&s;s which they deplored. Scarcely le&s;s &s;orrowful is the occa&s;ion, or le&s;s afflictive the death now felt and deplored by this American I&s;rael. The Children of Columbia now weep for Wa&s;hing|ton in the plains of America. Nor is it a lo&s;s to America only, but to the world: his name is gone forth into all the civilized nations of the earth. Such in&s;tances of pre-eminent virtue and patriot|i&s;m, but rarely ble&s;s the world. What an ine&s;ti|mable trea&s;ure, to a nation, are &s;uch talents&mdash;&s;uch experience&mdash;&s;uch a heart&mdash;as Wa&s;hington's! What a re&s;ource&mdash;what a &s;afeguard&mdash;in all &s;ea&s;ons of na|tional perplexity and danger! The privation of &s;uch a character, is a lo&s;s incalculable!</P>
<P>WHILE we deplore his death, let us be thankful that he has been continued &s;o long to us, and that &s;o many ble&s;&s;ings have been di&s;pen&s;ed to us through his in&s;trumentality. And as we have heretofore regarded the continuance of his life, as a token of divine favor towards us; &s;o we are now reminded,
<PB N="20" REF="037426_0018_100D40DA767AB760">
that his removal from us is an evidence of divine di&s;plea&s;ure. The removal of &s;o good, &s;o great and &s;o important a character is a frown of Heaven, on the nation, an awful reproof for its ingratitude and wickedne&s;s. Depriving a people of their guides, is withdrawing the in&s;truments of their protection and pro&s;perity, and con&s;equently preparing them for the divine judgments which are about to be execut|ed upon them. Such was God's procedure with his ancient people, when they rebelled again&s;t him, as we are a&s;&s;ured by the words of the prophet. <HI>Be|hold, the Lord, the Lord of ho&s;ts doth take away from Judah and Jeru&s;alem, the &s;tay and the &s;taff, the mighty man and the man of war, the judge and the prophet, the prudent, the ancient, the honorable man and the coun&s;ellor.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the &s;tations and places of &s;uch characters are made de&s;titute, where &s;hall we find others to fill them. There are no more Wa&s;hington's in America&mdash;no&mdash;nor on the earth. <HI>He that wounds alone can heal, he that has made the breach alone can repair.</HI></P>
<P>2d. WE are al&s;o taught, my brethren, that there is no defence or &s;ecurity again&s;t the great and uni|ver&s;al de&s;troyer, death. Amid&s;t the vigorous ex|erci&s;e and exten&s;ive u&s;efulne&s;s of the greate&s;t talents of the greate&s;t men, and in the &s;plendor of their glory, death approaches, &s;preads its awful ravages, and clo&s;es the &s;cene.</P>
<P>How many wi&s;e and good, have been &s;wept away with the preceeding generations! Many within our
<PB N="21" REF="037426_0019_100D40DC0CB25DC0">
own recollection, who&s;e departure from the world was an irreparable lo&s;s! Communities have been deprived of their civil and moral guides; and na|tions, of their wi&s;e men and rulers. The &s;hields of the earth, and the benefactors of mankind, mu&s;t did, like other men&mdash;<HI>there is no di&s;charge</HI>&mdash;<HI>Verily man at his be&s;t e&s;tate is altogether vanity.</HI></P>
<P>SOON, my hearers, we &s;hall all be tran&s;mitted to the world of &s;pirits. We mu&s;t &s;tand in <HI>our</HI> lot, not only in this world, but al&s;o in the world to come. Let it then be our great concern, in our &s;everal &s;ta|tions and character in life, to act our part well on the theatre of the world, that; at la&s;t, we may be approved of God, and found of our Judge in peace. And when the great drama of life &s;hall clo&s;e, <HI>may we unite with the &s;pirits of the ju&s;t made perfect, and come to Zion with &s;ongs and everla&s;ting joys upon our heads.</HI></P>
