<BIBL>PSALM 18th&mdash;XLVI Ver&s;e,</BIBL>
<Q><HI>THE LORD LIVETH</HI>&mdash;</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>To di&s;cipline and direct our meditations, and reflections, in the various circum&s;tances of life, and occurrences of providence, is no &s;mall or un|important duty. In every event of providence there is a voice; the heart of the wi&s;e &s;hould &s;tudy to an&s;wer, and meet the ju&s;t expectations of a mer|ciful and righteous Sovereign.</P>
<P>We inhabit a world &s;ubject to many and great changes, by any of which our intere&s;ts may be &s;ud|denly and materially affected. The changes in the heavens and in the earth are reacted in the walks of civil, political, and &s;ocial life. And no man knoweth what may be on the morrow, or what may be the i&s;&s;ues of the pa&s;&s;ing day. But, as men, and as chri&s;tians, we believe the&s;e changes are not the effect of chance, or of unintere&s;ted de&s;ign; they are a part of the maje&s;tic government of him, who is above all changes, 'the &s;ame ye&s;terday, to day,
<PB N="6" REF="037064_0003_100C3FDD83724360">
and forever.' In this view, the importance of at|tending to the volume of providence is greatly in|crea&s;ed; and the duty of regarding the work of the LORD, and of con&s;idering the operations of his hand, appears more eminent.</P>
<P>We live in an eventful period&mdash;a period, replete with changes, &s;erious in their nature, and exten&s;ive in their operation and con&s;equences. We hear of wars and rumors of wars, read of nations ri&s;ing up again&s;t nations, and kingdoms again&s;t kingdoms, and tremble for the fate of empires, involved in wild confu&s;ion, apparently tottering to their ba&s;e.</P>
<P>Remote from the &s;cene of terror, and pre&s;erved hitherto, in a good degree of tranquillity, by the &s;miles of heaven, upon the wi&s;dom of our coun&s;els, the purity of our principles, and the firmne&s;s and independence of our patriots, we flattered our&s;elves with the hope of impunity and peace. But the melancholy tidings, which the la&s;t week &s;aluted our ears, carried from town to town by the reiterated knell of death, excite a ju&s;t and alarming appre|hen&s;ion that GOD is coming out in ways of judg|ment again&s;t us, and calling home his &s;ervants from the gathering &s;torm.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON, the great&mdash;the GENERAL the STATESMAN, the COUNSELLOR, the FRIEND of AMERICA and of MAN is DEAD! He, who combined a greater a&s;&s;emblage of talents, virtues, and excellencies nece&s;&s;ary to form the &s;u|pereminent human benefactor, than are perhaps left to any &s;urvivor, is no more. Weep, O AMERICA, defended by his arm, in the time of danger, guided by his wi&s;dom, prudence, and patrioti&s;m, in &s;cenes
<PB N="7" REF="037064_0004_100C3FDF0A635128">
of political embarra&s;&s;ment and perplexity, taught by his coun&s;els and example in pro&s;perity and ad|ver&s;ity, weep o'er thy FATHER &s;uddenly taken from thy head.</P>
<P>Whatever &s;hades, envy or malice, party &s;pirit or ingratitude, may attempt to draw over the vir|tues or exploits of our departed Sage, it will be univer&s;ally acknowledged, that 'a Prince and a Great Man has fallen among us.' To pay no tri|bute of re&s;pect to the memory of &s;uch a Benefactor would be the height of ingratitude; and to at|tempt no religious improvement of an event in providence, that has &s;o deeply wounded the public mind, would be a height of impiety at which mod|ern infidelity might blu&s;h, and modern &s;tupidity &s;hudder.</P>
<P>It will not, however, be expected that I &s;hould at|tempt to delineate the character of GENERAL WASHINGTON, or to do ju&s;tice to the merits and exploits of this fir&s;t and be&s;t of men. This is a theme that requires other talents, and other data, than I po&s;&s;e&s;s, and will doubtle&s;s command the ex|ertions of the mo&s;t brilliant geniu&s;es in poetry and pro&s;e. I &s;hall only &s;ay, That the MAN, whom we lament, appeared, &s;pecially de&s;igned, rai&s;ed, and formed by Heaven, for the times in which he lived: the &s;pheres in which he moved, and the events of which he was to be the important in&s;trument; that no man ever di&s;covered more patriotic firmne&s;s and integrity, or more di&s;intere&s;tedly &s;erved his fellow men, and that he never cea&s;ed to de&s;erve well of his country.</P>
<P>To endeavour to direct and regulate your feel|ings
<PB N="8" REF="037064_0005_100C3FE101796548">
and reflections on &s;o affecting an occa&s;ion, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t you in making a religious improvement of an event &s;o impre&s;&s;ive in its nature, and intere&s;ting in its probable con&s;equences, falls more immedi|ately within my province; and is a duty which it would be unpardonable for a mini&s;ter not to at|tempt, tho' he &s;hould fall far below his wi&s;hes, or the expectations of his hearers.</P>
<P>Apprehen&s;ive that the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion, from a &s;hock &s;o great, &s;o &s;udden, and unexpected, mu&s;t be of the depre&s;&s;ing kind, I cho&s;e the words of my text to meet a &s;pirit of de&s;pondence, and check the fainting &s;oul, &s;inking in the day of rebuke. <HI>The LORD liveth&mdash;WASHINGTON, the great and good; great in him&s;elf, great in all &s;tations, in principle, purpo&s;e; and execution; illu&s;triou&s;ly great in &s;cenes of difficulty, de|manding human energy and deci&s;ion, is DEAD:</HI> but He who made him great &s;till lives&mdash;lives above all changes, and reigns above control.</P>
<P>The Sovereign Proprietor of talents, in various proportion, be&s;tows them upon his &s;ervants. To one he gives ten talents, to another five, and to others one; filling up the intermediate &s;paces, as occa&s;ion and circum&s;tances require. The mo&s;t di&s;|tingui&s;hed of our race have nothing but what they receive. A native &s;en&s;e of this, a regular and de|vout acknowledgment of dependance upon divine providence, and of indebtedne&s;s to divine influence and intepo&s;ition, formed a luminous trait in the character of our departed General. To glory over others, for that which is altogether received, is the mark of a little, or a ba&s;e mind; as it is of an ig|norant and unprincipled one, not to acknowledge the author of its benefits. The talents with which
<PB N="9" REF="037064_0006_100C3FE2AB1DB458">
we are intru&s;ted, add not a cubit to our &s;tature; in our improvement of them con&s;i&s;ts our glory and reward. Our illu&s;trious fellow citizen, who was honored with as many talents as were ever intru&s;t|ed to mortal man; and who honored him&s;elf more than others by his u&s;e and improvement of them, is called to his account, leaving a bereaved country, and a weeping nation, crying, 'My father; my fa|ther; the chariots of I&s;rael and the hor&s;emen there|of.' Yet, the LORD liveth, who intru&s;ted him with the&s;e talents. The &s;ource is inexhau&s;ted, and inexhau&s;tible, from whence they were derived; with GOD is the re&s;idue of the &s;pirit. He can form and furni&s;h other characters as exactly &s;uited to ex|i&s;ting or expected circum&s;tances, as our departed <HI>Hero, State&s;man, &amp; Politician,</HI> was to tho&s;e threatening ones, which have pa&s;&s;ed over us. 'Have pa&s;&s;ed over us,' exclaims the alarmed and fainting &s;oul! "Never was there a &s;ea&s;on of more imminent danger to our country; never a time that called louder for tho&s;e peculiar talents, which di&s;tingui&s;hed this illu&s;|trious Patriot, this be&s;t of men. Europe is in con|vul&s;ions. The nations, with whom we have prin|cipal connection, are mo&s;t deeply intere&s;ted in the threatning &s;cene; envying our growing greatne&s;s, they are re&s;pectively jealous of its preponderating influence, and fruitful in expedients to convert it to their own benefit. An important negociation is now depending with the French nation, the &s;ucce&s;s of which mu&s;t depend more upon intere&s;ted than honorable views and motives&mdash;When they &s;hall hear that WASHINGTON is dead, the &s;oul of our armies, the center of our union, the in&s;pirer of our coun&s;els, who&s;e name was a ho&s;t, and his virtues a pavilion, revered by the virtuous, and dreaded by the unprincipled of all climes; they will &s;purn our
<PB N="10" REF="037064_0007_100C3FE513E83CB8">
generous and pacific overtures, repeating the in|dignities they have already offered. Other rival or de&s;pi&s;ing nations will ri&s;e in their exactions, in|juries, and in&s;ults, when they &s;ee, that our defence and glory are departed from us."</P>
<P>If the&s;e fears are ju&s;t and rational, as probably they are, and this tribute of re&s;pect is due to the virtues and talents of the great decea&s;ed, yet let us meet the&s;e fears with the language of the text, and pay divine honors to the perfections of <HI>Jehovah. 'The LORD liveth,</HI> and ble&s;&s;ed be our rock, and let the GOD of our &s;alvation be exalted.' 'He &s;itteth in the congregation of the mighty, He judgeth a|mong the gods.' 'He is the wonderful coun&s;ellor, the Prince of peace!' It is indeed God's u&s;ual me|thod to work by probable means and in&s;truments; yet he can accompli&s;h his purpo&s;es without them; and often di&s;plays the glory of his admini&s;tration by di&s;appointing the mo&s;t rational expectations; and pouring the blu&s;h upon all human conjecture. 'He turneth wi&s;e men backward, and maketh diviners mad!' He has intimate acce&s;s to the hearts of men, and can influence and overrule them at his plea|&s;ure. 'There is no coun&s;el, under&s;tanding or might again&s;t the LORD!' 'He can look upon every one that is high and bring him low; he can make a little one to become a thou&s;and, and a &s;mall one a &s;trong nation.' If national pride and in&s;olence, impiety and profanene&s;s &s;hould take occa&s;ion, from the afflictive vi&s;itation of heaven, to tyrannize and oppre&s;s, to treat with in&s;olence and &s;corn tho&s;e whom 'GOD hath wounded', let us remember 'the LORD liveth.' In &s;uch a ca&s;e, may we not expect the &s;pecial interpo&s;ition of providence, and the di&s;|play of divine aid in the mount of difficulty. 'If
<PB N="11" REF="037064_0008_100C3FE70E219D60">
thou &s;ee&s;t the oppre&s;&s;ion of the poor, marvel not at the matter; He who is higher than the highe&s;t re|gardeth, and there be higher than they.' Tho' we have great rea&s;on for deep humiliation under this bereaving &s;troke, which has weakened our defence, and veiled our glory; and cannot but be concerned for its probable influence upon our foreign intere&s;ts and relations, yet we have no &s;ufficient cau&s;e for terrifying fears, or de&s;ponding apprehen&s;ions; for, the LORD lives, who has ever been the &s;hield and defence of America, permitting no weapon formed again&s;t her, ultimately, to pro&s;per. 'He is a &s;trong hold in the day of trouble, he knows all them that tru&s;t in him.'</P>
<P>Scarcely are the&s;e fears &s;oothed, re&s;pecting our foreign relations, e'er others more formidable ari&s;e, re&s;pecting our dome&s;tic intere&s;ts, expre&s;&s;ed in ac|cents like the&s;e. "While our honor and pro&s;perity, our &s;afety and comfort, if not our exi&s;tence as a nation, depend upon our union; upon harmoniz|ing and concentrating public &s;entiment and affec|tion, the <HI>great band of our union is broken.</HI> The Man greatly beloved, univer&s;ally e&s;teemed, and the ob|ject of confidence in the camp and the Senate hou&s;e&mdash;who has once and again hu&s;hed the voice of fac|tion, &s;ilenced the clamour of party, and conciliated contending intere&s;ts and de&s;igns, is removed from the mid&s;t of us, and this at a time when divi&s;ion and animo&s;ity are at a threatning height, and di&s;|cord, di&s;cord, drowns the voice of rea&s;on, of patri|oti&s;m, of intere&s;t, and of religion."</P>
<P>The ju&s;tne&s;s of the&s;e accents thickens indeed the gloom of this afflictive event, and darkens the &s;hades in which it is &s;hrouded; giving us rea&s;on to
<PB N="12" REF="037064_0009_100C3FE8990C2BA0">
apprehend that GOD in judgment is vi&s;iting us, preparing &s;orer cha&s;tenings for an ungrateful peo|ple. Ancient di&s;pen&s;ations of providence may lead us to conclude, that, in mercy to our decea&s;ed Guardian, of whom we had rendered our&s;elves un|worthy, GOD has called him off from the evil that is coming, upon the country which he emancipated. By this event, &s;o afflictive to us, tho' we have rea|&s;on to hope, joyful to him, &s;aving him the morti|fication of &s;eeing the evil accelerated, by any farther di&s;regard of his parental advice and intreaty, which he poured forth, with &s;uch ardent affection, when he retired from the patriarchal Chair. We have rea|&s;on to fear that GOD is angry with us; but, that we provoke him no farther. Let us lay to heart this awakening &s;troke, 'let us hear the rod, and him that hath appointed it,' and let us give no occa&s;ion for the repetition of the complaint by the prophet. 'The righteous dieth and no man layeth it to heart, and merciful men are taken away, none con&s;idering that the righteous are taken away, from the evil to come.' But while we carefully avoid 'de&s;pi&s;ing this cha&s;tening of the LORD;' let us as carefully avoid 'fainting under his rebukes'. Our earthly media|tor between contending parties indeed is dead. He who&s;e voice was harmony, and his accents peace, is &s;hrouded in the tomb; but, our heavenly Peace. Maker &s;till lives. 'He has the hearts of all men in his hands, to turn them as the rivers of water.' 'He &s;tilleth the raging of the &s;ea, the noi&s;e of its waves, and the tumults of the people'. The human heart, indeed, cea&s;es to beat, that was the center of American affection; the tongue is &s;ilent in the grave, that poured forth the mo&s;t conciliating &s;trains of per&s;ua&s;ive eloquence; yet he being dead &s;till &s;peak|eth to us, in that admirable addre&s;s to the people
<PB N="13" REF="037064_0010_100C3FEADB4A3C90">
of the&s;e States which he poured forth with &s;o much patriotic ardor, and parental concern, when he retired from the chair of State. This legacy, more valuable than the beque&s;t of millions, will be reviewed and peru&s;ed with affectionate emotion; the tears of grateful &s;en&s;ibility, which it cannot fail to excite, may &s;o water the precious &s;eed that it &s;hall &s;pring up to a plentiful harve&s;t; and the &s;pirit of the addre&s;s, caught by every bo&s;om, may &s;o har|monize public &s;entiment, and correct the errors of patriotic ardor, as that all &s;hall turn indignant from foreign influence and intrigue, and glory only in the title of Americans. Happy, thrice happy coun|try, could this be effected! The &s;pirit of our de|parted Wa&s;hington would look down with tran&s;|port upon &s;uch a fruit of his departure; and con|&s;ider it the con&s;ummation of his earthly glory. GOD is able to effect this.</P>
<P>While we pay the tribute of grateful re&s;pect to the memory of our departed Hero, and mingle our tears with a weeping country, let us not indulge de&s;ponding apprehen&s;ions, but re&s;t on the a&s;&s;urance that the LORD lives, that it is his prerogative to bring light out of darkne&s;s, and good out of evil, and charge his darke&s;t providences with the highe&s;t ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>Loudly does this event &s;ummon us to 'cea&s;e from man who&s;e breath is in his no&s;trils;' and as loudly does it call us to tru&s;t only in the LORD. If &s;o much worth and excellence mu&s;t fail, let us de&s;pair of finding, below the &s;kies, an object of human confidence. And let our tru&s;t be in GOD, all ra|tional expectation is from him. Has there not been 'verily' a fault in us, in this particular? May not our
<PB N="14" REF="037064_0011_100C3FEDC35224B8">
merciful FATHER de&s;ign to correct our impiety, by this grievous &s;troke? We have venerated and extoled him, who was <HI>greate&s;t</HI> among men&mdash;Have we &s;uitably remembered who made him great? We have honored and prai&s;ed the Defender of his country, the Guardian of her rights&mdash;but, have our prai&s;es ultimately ari&s;en to the throne of GOD, who alone forms and furni&s;hes human benefactors? WASHINGTON is no more with us, to receive our a&s;criptions, to be the occa&s;ion of fe&s;tal a&s;&s;emblies, or the object of patriotic homage, but the LORD liveth, to receive our acknowledgments. To him, they are mo&s;t ju&s;tly due, that He rai&s;ed up for us &s;uch a character, furni&s;hing him with talents admi|rably &s;uited to the parts a&s;&s;igned him on the theatre of time. That he crowned with &s;ucce&s;s all his va|rious enterpri&s;es in his country's cau&s;e&mdash;That He made him great in the field, great in the cabinet, and &s;till greater in his retreat from public life; crowning all his glory, with a re&s;plendent lu&s;tre, by the eminence of his private virtues, and the con|&s;i&s;tency of his religious a&s;criptions. When a grate|ful country loaded him with prai&s;es, he laid his laurels at the feet of Him who ruleth in the Heavens: exclaiming with the P&s;almi&s;t. 'Not unto me, not unto me, but to thy name be the prai&s;e.' The Idol of an Empire vani&s;heth, but, the LORD lives to receive our acknowledgments. To him the tribute of prai&s;e is due, to him let the incen&s;e of a&s;cription ri&s;e.</P>
<P>While our prai&s;es are pre&s;ented, as mo&s;t ju&s;tly due, for the di&s;tinction confered, upon our age and nation, by the life and virtues of &s;o eminent a Be|nefactor. Let us earne&s;tly pray, that God would &s;anctify, to an afflicted and weeping country, the
<PB N="15" REF="037064_0012_100C3FEF4B49B5A0">
grievous rebuke of his providence in &s;ummoning him from us. That He would heal the breach, which his hand has made. That He would cau&s;e a double portion of the &s;pirit of his a&s;cending favo|rite to re&s;t upon his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in office; and cover them re&s;pectively with his falling mantle. That He would take us into his holy keeping, and be him&s;elf our Father, Guide, and Guardian. That He would give us grace, religiou&s;ly, to improve a providence &s;o affecting, and learn the le&s;&s;ons it is de&s;igned to teach.</P>
<P>In what piercing accents does this event pro|claim, the frailty and feeblene&s;s of man&mdash;the vanity of all earthly honors and di&s;tinctions. He, who has been the 'terror of the mighty, in the land of the living,' has no terror for the tyrant death. He, who has been the &s;hield of thou&s;ands in the time of danger, and the confidence of millions in the &s;ea&s;on of perplexity, has no &s;hield again&s;t death's fatal arrow, nor power in the day of di&s;&s;olution. Rank, &s;tation, and merit make di&s;tinctions and difference among men here; and they promote the order of &s;ociety, and the happine&s;s of &s;ocial inter|cour&s;e. But death confounds them all.</P>
<LG>
<L>" Earth's highe&s;t honors end in, here he lies;</L>
<L>" And du&s;t to du&s;t, concludes her noble&s;t &s;ong."</L>
</LG>
<P>What little cau&s;e is there for human pride, envy, or ambition. He is the de&s;erving man, who acts well the part a&s;&s;igned him, performs the duties of his &s;tation, with life and vigor, and moves with firmne&s;s and dignity in his &s;phere. What a &s;triking comment is the event we deplore upon pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture like the&s;e. 'What is man who&s;e breath is
<PB N="16" REF="037064_0013_100C3FF0D153E5D8">
in his no&s;trils, and wherein is he to be accounted of:' 'It is better to tru&s;t in the LORD than to put confidence in Princes.' 'Vanity of vanities, &s;aith the preacher, all is vanity.'</P>
<P>But, while this afflictive event teaches us the frailty and feeblene&s;s of man, the folly of tru&s;ting in an arm of fle&s;h, or boa&s;ting, in human honor, however eminent; does it not teach us the high importance of the Go&s;pel revelation, in which 'life and immortality are bro't to light.' And ought it not to excite the livelie&s;t gratitude that we are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this ine&s;timable trea&s;ure; and by the light derived from its divine Author, can pierce the &s;hades of death, and look with comfort to brighter &s;cenes? What accumulated horror re&s;ts on the clo|&s;ing &s;cene of life, if, viewed as the end of our ex|i&s;tence, the grave of our hopes and expectations? How does the mind &s;hudder at the idea, and the heart revolt from the apprehen&s;ion, that the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed and eminent of our race, no le&s;s than the mo&s;t infamous and u&s;ele&s;s &s;hould &s;ink in the gulf of utter annihilation? but the light of nature leaves them in one common ruin. Revelation alone a&s;&s;ures us that when 'the du&s;t returns to the earth as it was, the &s;pirit returns to GOD who gave it,' that the happy &s;oul honored with an approving &s;entence from the lips of JESUS, &s;hall pa&s;s from glory to glory, in progre&s;&s;ive elevation, far beyond the limits of our pre&s;ent conception. This brings light into the &s;hades of death, con&s;i&s;tency and glory into the mazy &s;cenes of time, and proclaims the pro|priety of our cheerfully confiding in the governing providence of GOD, and humbly &s;ubmitting to his &s;overeign hand.</P>
<P>Let us duly prize this ine&s;timable trea&s;ure, and
<PB N="17" REF="037064_0014_100C3FF2F7F38838">
&s;crupulou&s;ly watch again&s;t every attempt to wre&s;t it from us. Let us imbibe the &s;pirit of the Go&s;|pel&mdash;embrace its doctrines, obey its precepts, and imitate the example of its divine Author. He wept at the tomb of Lazarus, comforted the hearts that were torn with angui&s;h, rai&s;ing their thoughts from the darkne&s;s of death to the brightne&s;s of the morning of the re&s;urrection. Thus let us do on the pre&s;ent mournful occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Our beloved WASHINGTON is dead. 'The eye of him that hath &s;een him will &s;ee him no more.' He has no more a portion in the land of the living. But he will ri&s;e again, and we mu&s;t meet him at the bar of GOD. Let us &s;hew our|&s;elves worthy of &s;o great a character, and act becoming our relation to him as our political FA|THER, SAVIOR, and BENEFACTOR. Let him live in the lively remembrance of a grateful country. Let his coun&s;els be honored&mdash;his example be im|itated&mdash;his generous di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, firmne&s;s, and patrioti&s;m be emulated&mdash;and his mode&s;ty, piety, and per&s;everance be copied by all ranks in life. And while we gratefully exult in this uncommon gift of Heaven, &s;o long continued to us, and prai&s;e GOD for the ble&s;&s;ings of which he was the honored in&s;trument; let us act worthy of &s;uch a Sire. Standing fa&s;t in the liberty wherewith he has made us free, let us never &s;acrifice our birth right at the &s;hrine of ambition, nor lo&s;e our inheritance in the vortex of Di&s;cord.</P>

<HEAD>A SERMON, DELIVERED IN THE FIRST CHURCH IN PORTSMOUTH, JANUARY 5th, 1800. THE HOUSE BEING DRESSED IN MOURNING IN TOKEN OF RESPECT TO THE MEMORY OF GENERAL WASHINGTON.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT mean the&s;e emblems of mourn|ing, with which I &s;tand &s;urrounded? What event has &s;hrouded the &s;acred de&s;k in &s;able? Why the&s;e traces of deep-wrought &s;orrow on every counte|nance, and the&s;e badges of grief on every arm?</P>
<P>"Art thou a &s;tranger in America, and knowe&s;t not the cau&s;e of the&s;e appearances? GOD has come out in ways of judgment again&s;t us, covered with a cloud our dear country in his anger, &s;mote the pil|lars of it that they tremble, and filled every loin with pain; &s;ummoning from our head, by the re|lentle&s;s me&s;&s;enger of death, our political FATHER, SAVIOR, and BENEFACTOR. He has broken
<PB N="20" REF="037064_0016_100C3FF75F5E6158">
the golden pipe, the conduit of his choice&s;t national ble&s;&s;ings, and has dried up the &s;tream which water|ed and refre&s;hed the whole land. He has called home the favorite in&s;trument of his mo&s;t exten&s;ive benediction; who, by the &s;plendor of his talents, the di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of his patrioti&s;m, the purity of his character, the firmne&s;s of his principles, and the lu&s;tre of his exploits, &s;tands unrivalled among the &s;ons of fame. WASHINGTON is dead! who led our armies to victory, and our country to indepen|dence and peace; who pre&s;ided in conciliating the jarring intere&s;ts of America, and combined them in a Con&s;titution of General Government, which &s;trengthened us in our weakne&s;s, rai&s;ed us in our depre&s;&s;ion, &s;urrounded us with honor, and rapidly advanced us in the career of national pro&s;perity. The man to whom all eyes were directed in the day of danger, and in whom, when helpers failed, our hopes were centered, and who was ever ready to extend his &s;hield, and &s;pread his pavilion at the call of his country, is &s;uddenly &s;ummoned from his in|tercour&s;e with mortals. The&s;e emblems of grief are tokens of re&s;pect to departed worth, expre&s;&s;ing the &s;orrow of our hearts, and evincing a de&s;ire to conform to the a&s;pects of Providence, and meet the voice of GOD &s;ummoning to deep humiliation."</P>
<P>Truly there is cau&s;e for all that we &s;ee, there is ju&s;t occa&s;ion for all that we feel. Too great honor, which falls &s;hort of divine, cannot be paid to the memory of a character &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed. Too great grief, which does not &s;ink into de&s;pondence, cannot be exhibited at the lo&s;s of &s;uch a Benefactor. Let America be hung in &s;able; let the voice of joy and gladne&s;s, of vain mirth and di&s;&s;ipation, be &s;ilent in her borders, until the a&s;pects of Providence brighten,
<PB N="21" REF="037064_0017_100C3FF9602026D0">
and the cloud, which covers her, be taken up. Let the heart of the wi&s;e be in the hou&s;e of mourning, till it effectually learn the vanity of man, the &s;ove|reignty of GOD, and the wi&s;dom of tru&s;ting unre|&s;ervedly in him. Let the heart of the devout un|cea&s;ingly pour forth its &s;upplications to the repairer of breaches, and the re&s;torer of paths to dwell in, that he would heal the breaches of our land, by rea&s;on of which it &s;haketh; and that he would make plain paths for our feet in this day of our re|buke, 'that the lame among us may not be turned out of the way, but effectually healed.'</P>
<P>I endeavored, you will recollect, to take early notice of this afflictive event, and pay a &s;mall tribute of re&s;pect to the memory of departed worth. My e&s;teem and veneration for our decea&s;ed Guardian and Benefactor would induce me to repeat the at|tempt, were I not con&s;cious, that any &s;trains of mine would be like the pebbled rivulet to the &s;treams of eloquence, which will be poured forth upon the occa&s;ion, or like the dim, trembling taper to the blaze of day.</P>
<P>Leaving in a mea&s;ure this theme and the event which has occa&s;ioned it, I would lead your attention to another, which this has indeed &s;ugge&s;ted; but which you will acknowledge to have been attended with effects, far more intere&s;ting and important to mankind. It is the death of the SON of GOD. For a contemplation of this &s;cene the tran&s;actions of the pa&s;t week, and the event which occa&s;ioned them may have prepared the mind; and the duty of the day calling us to commemorate the dying love of CHRIST, renders it a &s;ubject highly proper

for our meditation. The attending circum&s;tance of his death, which I de&s;ign to make the &s;ubject of &s;ome remarks, is recorded&mdash;</P>
<Q><BIBL>MATTHEW, 27th Chap. 45th Ver&s;e.</BIBL>
NOW FROM THE SIXTH HOUR THERE WAS DARKNESS OVER ALL THE LAND UNTO THE NINTH HOUR.</Q>
<P>WHAT an a&s;toni&s;hing event was this! What a mighty cau&s;e mu&s;t there have been to have produced &s;uch an effect&mdash;to have occa&s;ioned &s;uch a &s;cene! We have &s;een the earth covered with dark|ne&s;s in the ab&s;ence of the &s;un during the hours of re&s;t; but this commenced at high noon, when the &s;un was at its meridian altitude, and had reached the zenith of its &s;plendor. For the Jews began to reckon their time from our &s;ix o'clock in the morn|ing, &s;o that their &s;ixth hour was mid-day, and their ninth, three in the afternoon, including that part of the day in which the light and heat are mo&s;t powerful. We have &s;een partial darkne&s;s, during a &s;hort &s;ea&s;on, and over a limited &s;pace, owing to eclip&s;es of the &s;un by the interference of the moon. This can happen at new moon only, nor can it po&s;|&s;ibly continue for the &s;pace of three hours; but the darkne&s;s at the death of CHRIST demon&s;trably happened at the time of full-moon, when no &s;uch interference could po&s;&s;ibly take place. CHRIST was crucified at the time of the Jewi&s;h Pa&s;&s;over, which happened upon the fourteenth day of the fir&s;t month; and their months, if not in the begin|ning, yet towards the decline of their &s;tate always began with the new moon. This is atte&s;ted by <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> a Jewi&s;h prie&s;t, and therefore an unexcep|tionable
<PB N="23" REF="037064_0019_100C3FFD92D6EBF8">
witne&s;s, who expre&s;sly a&s;&s;erts, that the Day of Expiation, and con&s;equently all other fea&s;ts were reckoned by the age of the moon. This mu&s;t have been a preternatural and miraculous eclip&s;e, a black covering &s;pread over the light of heaven. We have &s;een cities, &s;tates, and countries covered with gloom, and their inhabitants dre&s;&s;ed in &s;able, at the ex|tinction of civil, political, and religious lights, at the death of eminent and exalted characters; but never did we &s;ee the light of heaven &s;u&s;pended, and the whole land covered with darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>What was the mighty cau&s;e of this phenome|non?&mdash;the dreadful plot which &s;pread this &s;able &s;cenery? A cau&s;e more than &s;ufficient, a my&s;tery at which heaven and earth wonder and adore. The SON of GOD was then hanging on the cro&s;s&mdash;the SAVIOR of the world was then bleeding on Mount Calvary&mdash;the light of Heaven was trem|bling to its extinction&mdash;and, what was more than all, the &s;potle&s;s, innocent, and divine JESUS was dying under the in&s;ults and revilings of rebel worms. The envious and malicious rulers of the Jews had extorted a &s;entence of crucifixion from the pu&s;il|lanimous Roman governor, and early in the morn|ing they prepare for its execution. They load our SAVIOR with his cro&s;s, and lead him forth to Calvary; by the third hour they &s;tretch him on the wood, rai&s;e him between Heaven and earth in company with two notorious malefactors, and with hearts harder than adamant '&s;it down to watch him.' Tho&s;e who pa&s;&s;ed by reviled him, wagging their heads, and in&s;ulting him with the declara|tions he had made, that he would build the temple in three days, and that he was the Son of GOD. Chief Prie&s;ts, Scribes, and Elders, forgetting the gravity of age, and de&s;cending from the dignity of their &s;tations, mocked him al&s;o, and &s;aid 'he &s;aved
<PB N="24" REF="037064_0020_100C3FFFA74252D0">
others, him&s;elf he cannot &s;ave.' Even the thieves, crucified with him, 'ca&s;t the &s;ame in his teeth.'</P>
<P>This was too much for the light of Heaven to behold. The &s;un withdrew from a &s;pectacle &s;o awful, the foundations of the earth were &s;haken, and 'there was darkne&s;s over all the land from the &s;ixth hour to the ninth.' This doubtle&s;s &s;ilenced their cruel invectives, and induced an awful &s;u&s;|pence, and uncertainty of what would be the i&s;&s;ue. During the&s;e three long hours, we do not read, that a word e&s;caped the lips of our SAVIOR. His &s;oul, retired within it&s;elf, was probably in the ut|mo&s;t agony, conflicting with the powers of dark|ne&s;s. The &s;urrounding darkne&s;s was an emblem of the greater darkne&s;s, which &s;hrouded his &s;oul under the hidings of his Father's face. At the ex|piration of this &s;cene of horror, JESUS cried with a loud voice 'Eli, Eli, lama &s;abachthani! My God, my God, why ha&s;t thou for&s;aken me!' breathing a prayer of forgivene&s;s for his betrayers and mur|derers, 'he cried again, and yielded up the gho&s;t.'</P>
<P>But are any ready to a&s;k, "why was this tre|mendous event permitted? why was this glo|rious character immolated?" O my brethren, had there not been a cau&s;e it would not have taken place. "Could he not have re&s;cued him&s;elf from the hands of ruffians, and looked his foes into con|fu&s;ion?" Had he not been bound with other bands, than tho&s;e the &s;oldiers u&s;ed, he would readily have re&s;cued him&s;elf from &s;ufferings; but he was bound with cords of love and compa&s;&s;ion towards a guilty world. We had rebelled again&s;t our Sovereign, were pri&s;oners of ju&s;tice and objects of wrath. Upon us the full vials mu&s;t have been poured, and we mu&s;t have weltered in everla&s;ting woe, had not
<PB N="25" REF="037064_0021_100C40012FB83B78">
JESUS offered him&s;elf our &s;urety and mediator. 'He who knew no &s;in was made a &s;in offering for us, that we might be made the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him.' 'GOD laid upon him the iniquity of us all,' 'and he bore our &s;ins in his own body on the tree, that by his &s;tripes we might be healed.' He could not then be relea&s;ed from his &s;ufferings without relinqui&s;hing his object. Therefore he cries in the full pro&s;pect of his &s;ufferings, 'I have a bapti&s;m to be bapti&s;ed with, and how am I &s;trait|ened till it be accompli&s;hed.' His love for a guilty world was '&s;tronger than death, which many waters could not quench nor floods drown. Therefore he &s;hrunk not from the pro&s;pect; therefore he delivered not him&s;elf from his angui&s;h, nor refu&s;ed to drink the cup, nece&s;&s;ary to be drank to &s;ave a guilty world, though mingled to the brim with the bittere&s;t ingredients. This indeed was love, benev|olence, and compa&s;&s;ion like a God. 'Though he was in the form of GOD, and thought it no robbery to be equal with GOD, yet he made him&s;elf of no reputation and took upon him the form of a &s;er|vant;' and for as much as the objects of his love and compa&s;&s;ion 'were partakers of fle&s;h and blood, he al&s;o took part of the &s;ame,' and put him&s;elf into a capacity of being 'in all points tempted like as we are, yet without &s;in.'</P>
<P>The life of our SAVIOR was devoted to our &s;er|vice; to the communication of the mo&s;t important in&s;truction, and to the deliverance of the human mind from the horrors of &s;uper&s;tition, and the doubts and fears of ignorance, error, and delu&s;ion. He di&s;tributed the fruits of his beneficence where-ever he went, relieved every afflicted object which &s;ought his aid, and finally died for our guilty race

under the forementioned circum&s;tances. By his death he appea&s;ed the wrath of Heaven, '&s;poiled principalities and powers,' which had brought us into va&s;&s;alage, 'triumphing over them on the cro&s;s,' and purcha&s;ed for us eternal redemption. Words are too feeble, language too inadequate to give us any idea of the glory of this per&s;onage, or of the obligation we are under to this 'Captain of Salvation,' this mighty Deliverer of the human race.</P>
<P>We have heard of eminent characters rai&s;ed up among mankind, who &s;eemed to &s;urpa&s;s the com|mon cla&s;s of mortals, as much perhaps as angels &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ed them. We read of heroes, &s;ages, and &s;tate&s;|men, who have devoted their lives to the &s;ervice of their fellow men, and who have been gloriou&s;ly in|&s;trumental in defending, delivering, and exalting their country. We have &s;een one, who perhaps &s;tands at the head of the catalogue, who was born for his fellow men, lived the Defender, Guardian, Father, and Benefactor of his country, and who&s;e death has covered it with univer&s;al gloom. But rai&s;e your eyes, Chri&s;tians, and behold an object more &s;tupendous! Rai&s;e your eyes, mortals, and behold the divine JESUS&mdash;a per&s;onage &s;o exalted, that all the angels of GOD were commanded to wor&s;hip him. HE, laying a&s;ide his glory, and taking the form of a &s;ervant, devoted his life, not only to the &s;ervice of a country and an age, but to the &s;ervice of the world throughout all generations. HE vo|luntarily &s;acrificed his life for their &s;alvation; en|during the wrath of GOD, and a conflict with Devils, that they might be delivered from the wrath to come, and from the va&s;&s;alage of Satan, and be exalted, not to the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed height of
<PB N="27" REF="037064_0023_100C4005C2BAC2D0">
earthly &s;plendor merely, but to 'crowns&punc; of glory' in the regions of immortality 'which &s;hall never fade away,' to heights of felicity in tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed abodes, 'which eye hath not &s;een, nor ear heard, neither have entered in the heart of man to con|ceive.' And all this, for whom? For his friends?&mdash;For the well-de&s;erving?&mdash;For the virtuou&s;ly un|happy? No, my brethren. For his enemies&mdash;for the ill-de&s;erving&mdash;for voluntary rebels to his crown and dignity. 'GOD commendeth his love towards us, in that, while we were yet &s;inners, CHRIST <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> for the ungodly.' Wonder, O Heaven! be a&s;toni&s;hed, O Earth! and let univer&s;al nature prai&s;e and adore! What a tribute of prai&s;e is due to &s;uch a benefactor! What obligation we are under to &s;uch infinite beneficence!</P>
<P>Though there is no term of compari&s;on between this divine per&s;onage, and the mo&s;t exalted of the creation, though all nations are before him, 'as the drop of the bucket,' and the highe&s;t human character mu&s;t be lo&s;t in the &s;malle&s;t of his glories; yet may I not, with adoring reverence, take occa&s;ion from your pre&s;ent feelings, and the event which has excited them, to rea&s;on with you upon your duty to the divine JESUS, who&s;e emba&s;&s;ador I am, and to whom I would e&s;pou&s;e you.</P>
<P>You have tears of gratitude, affection, and re&s;pect for our beloved WASHINGTON, when you call to mind his virtues, his di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, and bene|factions. Nor are they cen&s;urable.

<HEAD>A SECOND SERMON, DELIVERED LORD'S DAY, JANUARY 5, 1800, FROM MATTHEW, 27th Chap. 45th Ver&s;e. NOW FROM THE SIXTH HOUR THERE WAS DARKNESS OVER ALL THE LAND UNTO THE NINTH HOUR.</HEAD>
<P>OUR preceding di&s;cour&s;e contained &s;ome remarks upon the new and extraordinary phenome|non mentioned in the text. They were de&s;igned to prove that the darkne&s;s could not be the effect of any natural cau&s;e, but was a miraculous atte&s;ta|tion to the tragedy then acting on earth, expre&s;&s;ing the &s;ympathy of heaven with the divine &s;ufferer.</P>
<P>The glorious IMMANUEL, by whom the heav|ens were &s;pread, the earth founded, and the race of men created, nailed to the accur&s;ed tree, was then &s;u&s;pended between heaven and earth, an object of in&s;ults and abu&s;e, for rebel worms! The innocent and holy JESUS was then &s;hedding his precious blood, and offering his life, an expiatory &s;acrifice, for the &s;ins of men; nay more, He was &s;poiling principalities and powers, who had led us captive,
<PB N="32" REF="037064_0027_100C400E388DD050">
and drinking the cup of divine wrath filled to the brim by our &s;in and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. Nature, &s;ym|pathi&s;ing with its dying Lord, was convul&s;ed at the tremendous &s;pectacle. The &s;un withdrew his rays&mdash;the heavens &s;pread their &s;able curtains&mdash;and earth was wrapt in awful gloom. Here we find the cau&s;e of the&s;e hours of darkne&s;s, of this tem|porary extinction of the light of heaven.</P>
<P>It is the opinion of many, that this darkne&s;s was confined to the land of Judea, upon which the principal guilt of the crucifixion re&s;ts. The com|mon tran&s;lation of our Bible is favorable to &s;uch an opinion, but the original is as favorable to an univer&s;al darkne&s;s. It is however of little con&s;e|quence which it was; a darkne&s;s, confined to the land of Judea, was no le&s;s a miracle, under exi&s;ting circum&s;tances, than a darkne&s;s commen&s;urate with the globe. There was no &s;ufficient natural cau&s;e of the former, and the &s;ame power, that miracu|lou&s;ly &s;u&s;pended the rays of the &s;un from a portion of the globe could as ea&s;ily &s;u&s;pend them from the whole. That the Jews &s;hould attempt to &s;uppre&s;s this miracle, or, &s;ince they could not do that, to le&s;&s;en it as much as po&s;&s;ible, was to be expected, con&s;idering their ob&s;tinate unbelief, con&s;ummated by the ridiculous tale invented to confute the evidence of the Savior's re&s;urrection. "But," &s;ay the advocates for partial darkne&s;s, "there was not the &s;ame cau&s;e for the &s;ilence of heathen writers, who &s;peak very little of this darkne&s;s." If there were no monuments of this event among them, it would be pre&s;umptive evidence that the darkne&s;s did not reach them; but one learned and judicious com|mentator &s;ays, that, '&s;ome of the ancients appealed to the annals of the nations concerning this ex|traordinary
<PB N="33" REF="037064_0028_100C400FC1FB04E0">
eclip&s;e, at the death of CHRIST, as a thing well known, and which gave notice to tho&s;e parts of the world, of &s;omething great then in doing.' Another mentions, by name, <HI>Phlegon</HI> as taking notice of this darkne&s;s; and mo&s;t &s;ay, that, <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> of Heliopolis in Egypt was filled with &s;o much wonder, a&s;toni&s;hment, and ju&s;t conviction, of the miraculou&s;ne&s;s of the event that he exclaimed 'Aut Deus naturae patitur, aut mundi machina di&s;&s;olvitur.' <HI>The God of nature &s;uffers, or the uni|ver&s;e is di&s;&s;olving.</HI> So ju&s;tly thought this renowned Philo&s;opher, ignorant of the tragedy then acting in Judea. The Roman Centurion and the guard which he commanded, for the purpo&s;e of aiding and &s;u|perintending the awful tran&s;actions of the day, who may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been &s;elected for their uncommon in&s;en&s;ibility, and congeniality to the occa&s;ion, when they &s;aw the darkne&s;s, the earth|quake, and the things that were done, lo&s;t their con|fidence and &s;tupidity, exclaiming, <HI>Surely, this was the SON OF GOD.</HI></P>
<P>Never did prodigies, like the&s;e at the death of CHRIST, mark any other triumph of the King of terrors. Great men have fallen&mdash;the greate&s;t, the wi&s;e&s;t, and the be&s;t, for 'No man hath power over the &s;pirit, to retain the &s;pirit, neither hath he power in the day of death, there is no di&s;|charge in that war.' 'The LORD hath taken away the mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, the prophet, and the prudent, and the an|cient, the captain of fifty, and the honorable man, and the coun&s;ellor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator.' GOD may have given, &s;ome times, premonitions of the death of eminent characters, that an afflicted people might be prepared

for their bereavement.&mdash;So deep has been the wound from the lo&s;s of men, in whom all that was great and good centered, that the country they have ble&s;&s;ed has &s;eemed to &s;ympathize with its inhabitants, and put on, as ours now does,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Winter.</HI></NOTE> a dreary and joyle&s;s ap|pearance; the hoar&s;e &s;ounding winds, and the chil|ling bla&s;ts may be imagined to re&s;pond to the &s;ighs and groans of the orphan family; but, never was there a death, except this of our divine SAVIOR, at which the heavens &s;pread their &s;ackcloth, dre&s;&s;ing them|&s;elves in darke&s;t &s;hades, and earth groaned to its lowe&s;t centre.</P>
<P>Does not this &s;triking difference at the death of CHRIST loudly proclaim his infinite &s;uperiority to all mortals, and afford us an important argument and evidence of his proper divinity? I pay re&s;pect to human greatne&s;s, e&s;pecially when allied to human virtue, and devoted to defend and ble&s;s mankind. Every token of veneration, gratitude and love, that falls &s;hort of divine, is but a ju&s;t tribute to excel|lence like that, of which America has lately been bereaved. But may I not pertinently take occa&s;ion, from this event and the emotions it excites, to bring into view our glorious EMMANUEL, and &s;hew how much he excels all human excellence; how ju&s;tly he is intitled to the highe&s;t homage, &s;upreme love, and everla&s;ting remembrance of our indebted race.</P>
<P>There are tho&s;e, who deny divine honors to our SAVIOR, or at lea&s;t, &s;trip him of his royal crown and diadem, by di&s;claiming his title to <HI>divine</HI> per|fections. They place him high, indeed, in the <HI>crea|tion</HI>

of GOD, the fir&s;t-born of every creature, as the model after which all human &s;ouls &s;hould be created; but they place him far below the dignity and honor of a divine per&s;on, and think him intitled to the homage that is paid him, more from his delegated power and authority, than his innate worth and excellence. Others there are, who con&s;ider CHRIST as no other than a mere man. They allow him, in|deed, to be an extraordinary man, rai&s;ed up and furni&s;hed as a &s;upereminent Prophet, commi&s;&s;ioned to publi&s;h the will of GOD to men, and by his in|&s;tructions and example to recover them from the paths of error, ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition, into which they had unhappily declined; that, in execution of his commi&s;&s;ion, he atte&s;ted the truth of his doctrines by his &s;ufferings, and &s;ealed them with his blood. Still, others there are&mdash;(it is a lamentation they are &s;o many, and an a&s;toni&s;hment they are &s;o active in their ruinous attempt!) who reject the whole chri&s;tian revelation, repre&s;enting the Go&s;pel as 'a cunningly devi&s;ed fable,' its hi&s;tory a forgery, and its author an impo&s;tor.

every po&s;&s;ible &s;ituation. The highe&s;t human bene|factors have expired in &s;cenes of their greate&s;t u&s;eful|ne&s;s&mdash;in the full career of glory&mdash;and when they have reached its &s;ummit. Sages and Legi&s;lators, Philo&s;o|phers and Morali&s;ts, who have wa&s;ted the mid-night lamp, and the mid-day &s;un, to reform and ble&s;s their fellow men, have had their purpo&s;es broken off, and left their benevolent wi&s;hes unaccompli&s;hed. And Prophets and Apo&s;tles, &s;ealing the truth of their doctrines with their blood, have expired under every &s;pecies of torture and ignominy, which the wit and malice of their enemies could invent: yet heaven and earth moved on their u&s;ual cour&s;es, &s;ilent, and unintere&s;ted &s;pectators of the &s;cenes. The greate&s;t and the be&s;t of men with us has died, the defender of our rights, the avenger of our wrongs, our political Father, friend and Benefactor, the glory of his country, and the boa&s;t of the human race; but we had no premonition of the event, no attend|ing te&s;timonials of his death. The inhabitants of our land have felt the &s;hock, and every where exhibit emblems of grief; but, the earth has maintained her u&s;ual &s;teadine&s;s, and the heavens have exhibited their accu&s;tomed brightne&s;s. Why was the death of Je&s;us &s;o greatly di&s;tingui&s;hed from the deaths of all the worthies that have ever fallen? Why &s;hould the earth tremble to its lowe&s;t ba&s;e, and the &s;un expire for three long hours? O, my brethren, the Centu|rion gives us the true rea&s;on, <HI>'Doubtle&s;s this was the SON OF GOD.'</HI> And Diony&s;ius of Heliopolis rea|&s;oned and concluded ju&s;tly, <HI>the GOD of nature &s;uf|fered.</HI> By which is not intended, that the divine nature, &s;imply con&s;idered, &s;uffered; but the divine nature was &s;o united with the human nature in CHRIST JESUS, that the per&s;on, who was dying on the cro&s;s, without the gates of Jeru&s;alem, was,
<PB N="37" REF="037064_0032_100C40180EEBC748">
in every proper con&s;ideration, <HI>a divine per&s;on; GOD</HI> and man my&s;teriou&s;ly united, con&s;tituting that <HI>'my&s;tery of godline&s;s, GOD manife&s;t in the fle&s;h,'</HI> into which angels pry with profound a&s;toni&s;hment. And this divine per&s;onage was then dying in agony, not <HI>merely</HI> to atte&s;t the truth of his doc|trines, and &s;eal his te&s;timony with his blood, but to make expiation for the &s;ins of men, and pre|&s;ent an adequate atonement for their guilt. He was conflicting with the powers of darkne&s;s, to re&s;cue us, captives, from their chain. He was &s;uffering that we might be happy&mdash;dying, that we might live&mdash;bearing the wrath of GOD, that we might enjoy his &s;miles, and reign with him forever.</P>
<P>Here was rea&s;on &s;ufficient for the mighty differ|ence between the death of CHRIST, and the deaths of all who have ever fallen, abundant cau&s;e for all the prodigies that attended his crucifixion, nay, is it not matter of wonder, that the ho&s;ts of heav|en had not interfered and re&s;cued their belov|ed? They would, had not he, from compa&s;&s;ion to man, re&s;trained their ardor. Is it not matter of &s;urprize that nature had not expired, in convul|&s;ive agonies, at the affecting &s;pectacle? It would, had not he &s;u&s;tained it, by his mighty power, that the &s;criptures might be fulfilled, and the great &s;alvation be effected.</P>
<P>Whatever homage, therefore, is due to created excellence, or human worth, infinitely higher is due to the LORD JESUS CHRIST. However deep the impre&s;&s;ion, made upon the human heart, by the death of the mo&s;t eminent, u&s;eful, and di&s;inter|e&s;ted human Benefactor, deeper &s;hould be the im|pre&s;&s;ion from the death of CHRIST.

upon the emotion that has been excited in the public mind, by the death of our beloved WASH|INGTON, or that they convey the remote&s;t degree of cen&s;ure, upon the tribute of grateful re&s;pect, that has been, &s;o univer&s;ally, paid to his memory. To have been unmoved at &s;uch bereavment, would have been the highe&s;t reflection upon our &s;en&s;ibili|ty, and to have withholden the tribute of mournful re&s;pect would have proved us impious and ungrate|ful. Every token of human re&s;pect that a widow|ed country can be&s;tow will fall &s;hort of the merit of its illu&s;trious Guardian. When this Father of his Country was performing his continental circuit, vi&s;iting the &s;everal apartments of his great family, to gratify the wi&s;hes of his affectionate children and give the patriarchal ble&s;&s;ing; as he approached this town, a ju&s;t and laudible zeal was exhibited, by every cla&s;s of citizens, to remove every ob&s;tacle out of the way, 'to make the crooked ways &s;traight, and the rough places plain.' The plea&s;ing &s;olicitude then di&s;played to give honor to the illu&s;trious de|fender of our rights, and prepare the way for his approach, &s;ugge&s;ted to me the propriety of di&s;cour|&s;ing to you upon the importance of preparing the way for the approach of the 'KING OF GLORY' and of removing every ob&s;tacle to <HI>his</HI> favoring us with a vi&s;it, who has ran&s;omed and redeemed his people, and wrought out eternal &s;alvation for them. Is there le&s;s propriety, that, from the death of this great man, whom 'the multitude of his brethren delight to honor,' and from the multiplied tokens of re&s;pect paid to his memory, I &s;hould take oc|ca&s;ion to di&s;cour&s;e to you upon the importance of paying all po&s;&s;ible homage to the LORD JESUS CHRIST, our once crucified, but now exalted Redeemer, at who&s;e feet, the highe&s;t of the heav|enly

<P>If departed &s;pirits have any knowledge of the tran&s;actions on earth, and the death of our ad|mired General &s;hould be the mean of affecting any heart more deeply with a &s;en&s;e of the death of CHRIST; or of exciting it to pay its unre|&s;erved homage to him&mdash;the venerable &s;hade, of our departed WASHINGTON, would more rejoice in this fruit of his death, than in all the triumphal arches, marble &s;tatues, or mournful monuments that a grateful country will rai&s;e to his memory. Will he not, then, approve my attempt, to direct your tears, &s;hed at his death, into the channel of weeping for your dying Je&s;us, and to elevate your veneration for his embalmed memory, to divine veneration of the adorable IMMANUEL, 'who is over all GOD ble&s;&s;ed forever.' Did not our chri&s;|tian Hero, while running his career of glory, bow dependent at the throne of grace, did he not a&s;cribe all his honors and &s;ucce&s;&s;es to the interpo|&s;ing influence of an overruling Providence? Is he not now, as we fondly hope, ca&s;ting his crown at the feet of JESUS, with a, 'not unto me, not unto me, but to thy name be the prai&s;e?' And, will he not be plea&s;ed, that earth &s;hould, this day, re&s;emble heaven, and his family left behind, &s;hould, at humbler di&s;tance, be imitating his exerci&s;es, and preparing for his joys? 'They mourn the

<P>A grateful public will doubtle&s;s erect, in one place and another, &s;tatues of the decea&s;ed, and adorn their public places with portraits large as the life, and with hi&s;toric paintings emblematic of his deeds; and grateful individuals, on public political occa|&s;ions, will flock to behold them, with emotions honorary to departed worth. And will any be un|concerned to have public places of wor&s;hip, where GOD may record his name? or neglect to a&s;&s;emble where he will accept their vows, and manife&s;t him|&s;elf in his own in&s;titutions?</P>
