<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE art of exerci&s;ing the faculty of thinking and reflecting upon every object that is &s;een, ought to con&s;titute a material branch of a good education; but it requires the &s;kill of a ma&s;ter's hand, to lead the minds of youth to the habit of ob|&s;ervation. Dr. Watts &s;ays, that there are four methods of attaining knowledge. Ob|&s;ervation, reading, conver&s;ation, and medi|tation. The fir&s;t lies within the compa&s;s even of children, and from the early dawn of rea&s;on, they &s;hould be accu&s;tomed to ob&s;erve every thing with attention, that falls under their notice. A judicious in|&s;tructor will find matter for a le&s;&s;on among tho&s;e objects, that are termed common or in&s;ignificant. How little this is generally the ca&s;e, may be collected from the igno|rance, not of children only, but &s;ometimes of youth, who, although they have attained a con&s;iderable degree of cla&s;&s;ical learning, are unacquainted either with the materials of tho&s;e things they daily u&s;e, or the meth|ods of manufacturing them. The form and appearance of &s;ub&s;tances are &s;o much
<PB N="iv" REF="036664_0003_100A5F3BE05A3DE8">
changed by the effects of art, that it would be impo&s;&s;ible for a mind, unprepared by in&s;truction, to conceive the original mate|rial of many things, that are in the mo&s;t common u&s;e. Would any child &s;uppo&s;e, that the cloth, of which her frock is made, is compo&s;ed of the fibrous parts of a green plant; or that the paper upon which &s;he draws, is the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance wrought into a different form; that the tran&s;parent gla&s;s, out of which &s;he drinks, was once a heap of &s;and and a&s;hes; or that the ribbon &s;he wears is the produce of an in&s;ect? The de|&s;ign of the following little work, is to ex|cite the curio&s;ity of young per&s;ons on the&s;e &s;ubjects, by furni&s;hing information on a few of the mo&s;t obvious. The form of dialogue has been adopted as be&s;t &s;uited to convey in&s;truction blended with amu&s;ement; be|ing de&s;irous that it &s;hould be read rather from choice than compul&s;ion, and be &s;ought by my young readers as an entertainment, not &s;hunned as a mere dry preceptive le&s;&s;on.</P>

<STAGE>SOPHIA <HI>and</HI> CECILIA.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>HOW happy are we, my dear &s;i&s;ter, to be ble&s;&s;ed with &s;uch parents, who devote &s;o much time to our in&s;truction and amu&s;ement! with what tenderne&s;s do they li&s;ten to our conver&s;ation, and improve every &s;ubject that ari&s;es to our advantage!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECILIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am never &s;o happy in any other com|pany; they have the art of rendering in&s;truction and &s;tudy agreeable. Though I tenderly love my gov|erne&s;s, I feel &s;uch a &s;uperior attachment to my mam|ma, that I am not able to expre&s;s it; and I am &s;ure Mrs. Selwyn will not blame me for it&punc; for &s;he always advi&s;es me to look up to my father and mother as my be&s;t and kinde&s;t friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mrs. Selwyn our worthy governe&s;s, is too wi&s;e and di&s;creet to be jealous of our preferring our parents to every body; &s;he would &s;ooner direct us to regulate our affections properly, and undoubt|edly give them the fir&s;t place.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECILIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>What bitter repentance do I feel, when I have done any thing to offend them, particularly when I am inattentive to their in&s;truction! How comes it, Sophia, that I am &s;o often idle, and my
<PB N="8" REF="036664_0007_100A5F44B60D3C08">
thoughts wander from what I am about, when I re|ally intend to be good?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are very young, my dear, and mam|ma &s;ays that the habit of attention is difficult to form; but that by &s;teadily endeavouring to fix our thoughts on one object we &s;hall every day find it more ea&s;y; and though it may co&s;t us &s;ome pains at fir&s;t, let us remember what we owe to the affectionate care of &s;uch a mother, and give our whole attention, when &s;he conde&s;cends to in&s;truct us.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECILIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I often pity poor Augu&s;t; &s;he has no mamma, and her governe&s;s &s;eldom teaches her any thing but her regular le&s;&s;ons.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I both love and pity her; &s;he is of a good di&s;po&s;ition, but has not received the &s;ame ad|vantages that we have; her papa is engaged in bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and leaves her wholly to the care of her gov|erne&s;s, who takes but little pains with her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECILIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us de&s;ire our parents to give as leave to invite her often to be pre&s;ent at our evening con|ver&s;ations. Papa has promi&s;ed to give us &s;ome ac|count of various manufactures; all will be new to her, &s;he will be delighted, and it will be a means of &s;upplying her with &s;ome of the in&s;truction &s;he wants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mamma will be very willing, I dare &s;ay: &s;he takes plea&s;ure in doing good, and is never better plea&s;ed than when &s;he has an opportunity of improv|ing young people.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECILIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I long for the evening, when we are all to meet in the &s;tudy. I wonder what will be the &s;ubject papa will have prepared for us. My brothers too are to be of the party, and when we have been &s;eparated all day, it is &s;uch a plea&s;ure to meet them, that I cannot &s;ay how delighted I am with the thoughts of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is almo&s;t time to attend our writing ma&s;ter, and do not let us forget the terms of admi&s;|&s;ion to the&s;e agreeable evening conver&s;ations; atten|tion to our le&s;&s;ons in the day, and obedience to the commands of our dear mamma, are the only methods
<PB N="9" REF="036664_0008_100A5F4639AC82D8">
of obtaining a &s;eat in the &s;tudy at night. Papa will not confine the &s;ubject of his lectures wholly to man|ufactures, but intends to explain the nature of the materials of what we wear and u&s;e, which will fre|quently lead him to de&s;cribe objects of natural hi&s;to|ry, a &s;tudy of which I am particularly fond.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECILIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are al&s;o &s;ometimes to &s;upply a &s;ub|ject, we are to have books given us, that we may be prepared, and are to be que&s;tioned on the given &s;ub|ject. I wi&s;h I may be able to an&s;wer properly.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hark! the bell rings for writing; we mu&s;t attend the &s;ummone.</P>

<HEAD>CONVERSATION II.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Mr. HARCOURT, Mrs. HARCOURT, AUGUSTA, SO|PHIA, CECILIA, CHARLES, and HENRY.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>MY dear Augu&s;ta, I am glad to &s;ee you; my girls tell me you de&s;ire to be of our party, when we meet of an evening. Your company will be always agree|able to me, and I hope our conver&s;ations will be in|&s;tructive to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AUGUSTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I accept the invitation with plea&s;ure; but I hope to receive entertainment as well as in&s;truc|tion; for I &s;hall never be able to attend to a long dry lecture, without &s;ome amu&s;ement to render it palatable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have cho&s;en the Whale for our &s;ubject to night, and the information it affords I ex|pect will be new and wonderful to you all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is not the Whale found in the &s;eas to|wards the north pole?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my dear, they chiefly inhabit the &s;eas towards the north pole; though many whales are caught in the South Seas towards that pole; but the chief fi&s;hery has been near the coa&s;t of Spitzber|gen, Nova Zembla, and Greenland; where many
<PB N="10" REF="036664_0009_100A5F484F193818">
&s;hips from this country go every year, for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of catching whales.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>We may admire the goodne&s;s of Providence, who leaves not the mo&s;t ob&s;cure corner of the globe without its peculiar riches. The&s;e coun|tries, which &s;carcely &s;upply food for their wretched inhabitants, and are covered with &s;now, full nine months in the year, are vi&s;ited by people from di&s;|tant parts of the world, who brave every danger, for the &s;ake of taking the whales, which are found in their &s;eas.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECILIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot think what u&s;e they can be of, to tempt people to go &s;o far for them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will find that they &s;upply &s;everal u&s;eful articles for our convenience. Your &s;tays, for example, would not be &s;o well &s;haped without whalebone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECILIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are the bones that &s;tiffen our &s;tays really the bones of whales?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>The &s;ub&s;tance called whalebone, adheres to the upper jaw, and is formed of thin paral|lel laminae, called whi&s;kers; &s;ome of the longe&s;t are four yards in length; they are &s;urrounded by long &s;trong hair, to guard the tongue from being hurt, and al&s;o to prevent the return of their food, when they di&s;charge the water out of their mouth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HENRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Whi&s;kers four yards long! how fierce the whale mu&s;t look! pray what &s;ize is he him&s;elf?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>The common whale is the large&s;t of all animals, of who&s;e hi&s;tory we have any certain account; it is &s;ometimes found ninety feet long, and tho&s;e which inhabit the torrid zone are &s;aid to be much larger. The &s;ize of the head is about one-third of the whole fi&s;h, the under lip is much broad|er than the upper, which is narrow and oblong, the tongue is a &s;oft, &s;pongy, fat &s;ub&s;tance, &s;ometimes yielding five or &s;ix barrels of oil; the gullet or &s;wal|low is very &s;mall for &s;o large an animal, not exceed|ing four inches in width; but that is proportioned to the food it eats, which is a particular kind of &s;mall
<PB N="11" REF="036664_0010_100A5F4D2023C0B0">
&s;nail; or, as &s;ome &s;ay, it varies its repa&s;t with the Medu&s;a, or &s;ea blubber, an in&s;ect which is found in the &s;ea.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is not the whale a fi&s;h of prey then? I thought it would devour men, if they unhappily fell in their way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>They are quite harmle&s;s and in|offen&s;ive to every thing but in&s;ects. The only dan|ger to be apprehended from them, is the &s;tarting of a plank in a &s;hip, or the overturning of a boat, with their huge bulk.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AUGUSTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh terrible! what can induce men to incur &s;uch dangers, when they may &s;tay quietly at home and enjoy them&s;elves?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are many &s;trong rea&s;ons that prevail with thou&s;ands to undergo a life of hard|&s;hip, toil, and danger. The nece&s;&s;ity of earning a living, to which you, who are brought up in the en|joyment of plenty, are &s;trangers, is one &s;trong in|ducement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I would chu&s;e &s;ome ea&s;ier employ|ment; a gardner has an agreeable life.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>But do you not reflect that all men cannot be gardeners; there is employment for but few in that line. Providence has wi&s;ely endued mankind with as great a variety of inclinations and pur&s;uits, as there is diver&s;ity in their per&s;ons; &s;ome &s;hew a very early inclination for a &s;ea-life, that no danger can deter, or per&s;ua&s;ions prevail with them to give up; which appears to be implanted for the purpo&s;e of providing the means of an intercour&s;e be|tween the inhabitants of di&s;tant countries, by which each party may reap advantage by interchanging the &s;uperfluous produce of di&s;tant climes, and exer|ci&s;ing the mutual good offices of love and kindne&s;s. But to return to the whale; it has two orifices in the middle of the head, through which it &s;pouts water to a great height, and, when it is di&s;turbed or wounded, with a noi&s;e like thunder. Its eyes are not larger than tho&s;e of an ox, and placed at a great di&s;tance
<PB N="12" REF="036664_0011_100A5F4EA4C0F368">
from each other. There is no fin on the back, but on the &s;ides, under each eye are two large ones which &s;erve it for rowing. The colour varies, the back of &s;ome being red, others black, and another variety is mottled; the belly is generally white. They are ex|tremely beautiful in the water; the &s;kin is very &s;mooth and &s;lippery. Under the &s;kin the whale is co|vered with fat or blubber, from &s;ix to twelve inches thick, which &s;ometimes yields from one to two hun|dred barrels of oil. All Europe is &s;upplied with oil for lamps, and many other purpo&s;es, from this blub|ber. The fle&s;h is red and coar&s;e, &s;omewhat like beef; the Greenlanders eat it, and the Icelanders &s;oak it in &s;our whey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>It mu&s;t be very di&s;agreeable food. I &s;hould think, the oil would make it very grea&s;y and &s;trong.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>So it does: but the poor people, who live in countries &s;o far north, have but little va|riety of meat to tempt their appetite. In winter, as your mother has already remarked, the ground is co|vered with &s;now, and affords no vegetation but a lit|tle mo&s;s, which is found on the bodies of trees, con|&s;equently the larger animals, &s;uch as cattle, &amp;c. can|not &s;ub&s;i&s;t there. The reindeer is peculiar to tho&s;e parts, and &s;upplies his ma&s;ter with a &s;canty provi&s;ion during that dreary &s;ea&s;on; but as they are valuable for many other purpo&s;es, they are unwilling to kill them, but from nece&s;&s;ity; the fle&s;h of the whale is therefore reckoned a dainty, which may afford us a le&s;&s;on, to be contented with beef and mutton, and to di&s;courage that &s;pirit of gluttony and &s;en&s;ual in|dulgence, that prevails too glaringly at the tables of the rich, who are &s;eldom &s;atisfied with one or two plain di&s;hes, but cover their tables with a profu&s;ion, that invites a fal&s;e appetite, and wa&s;tes the good things that are provided for our u&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do whales ever &s;tray &s;o far from their u&s;ual haunts, as to be found on our coa&s;ts? it would give me great plea&s;ure to &s;ee one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="13" REF="036664_0012_100A5F5076502108">
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>There have been in&s;tances of a few, that have been left at low water on &s;hore, but they occur but &s;eldom; when it happens, they are called royal fi&s;h, and become the property of the king and queen. Notwith&s;tanding its va&s;t &s;ize, the whale &s;wims &s;wiftly, and generally again&s;t the wind. The female brings but one, or at mo&s;t two young ones at a time, which are nine or ten feet long; they &s;uckle their young, and if pur&s;ued, &s;hew the &s;ame ma|ternal &s;olicitude for the pre&s;ervation of their offspring, as land animals, by wrapping them up in their fins clo&s;e to their bodies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, does the whale yield any other pro|duce, that is u&s;eful to man, except oil and whale|bone?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; Spermaceti is prepared from the oil that is found in the head of a whale. It is melted over a gentle fire, and put into moulds, like tho&s;e wherein &s;ugar loaves are formed; when cold and drained, it is taken out, and melted over again, till it be well purified and whitened; it is then cut with a knife into flakes, and is u&s;ed as a medicine for various complaints of the lungs; it is al&s;o u&s;ed for making candles, which are but little inferior to tho&s;e made of wax.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot imagine what means can be devi&s;ed to catch and manage an animal of &s;uch pro|digious &s;ize.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>No animal is &s;o large or powerful, but mu&s;t yield to the &s;uperior &s;agacity of man. The method of taking whales is truly curious, and I &s;hall have plea&s;ure in entertaining you with a recital of it.</P>

<P>The fleet u&s;ually &s;ets &s;ail about the beginning of April, and &s;teers northward, till they reach about the 75th degree of north latitude, where they u&s;ually begin to meet with the ice. It is among the&s;e huge heaps of ice, that float about in the&s;e &s;eas, that they find the whale, and there mo&s;t of the ve&s;&s;els take their &s;tation for the fi&s;hing. In the
<PB N="14" REF="036664_0013_100A5F5323A722E0">
Engli&s;h whale fi&s;hery, every &s;hip has &s;ix or &s;even boats belonging to it, each of which has one har|pooner, one man to &s;teer, one to manage the line, and four &s;eamen to row it; each boat is provided with two or three harpoons, &s;everal lances, and &s;ix lines fa&s;tened together, each one hundred and twen|ty fathoms long. To each harping iron is fa&s;tened a &s;trong &s;tick, about &s;ix feet long, and a &s;oft pliable line of as many fathoms, called the fore gauger, which is fa&s;tened to the lines in the boat. The in&s;trument with which the whale is &s;truck, is a harping iron, or jave|lin, pointed with &s;teel, in a triangular &s;hape, like the barb of an arrow. The harpooner, upon &s;ight of the fi&s;h, flings the harping iron with all his might a|gain&s;t its back; and if he be &s;o fortunate as to pene|tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e the &s;kin and fat, into the fle&s;h, he lets go a line fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ened to the harping iron, at the end of which is a gourd, which &s;wimming on the water, di&s;covers where the whale is: for, the minute he is wounded, he plunges to the bottom, commonly &s;wimming a|gain&s;t the wind; and this is the moment of danger, le&s;t he &s;hould outrun the length of the line, and pull the boat after him into the deep; to guard again&s;t this inconvenience, a man is fixed by the line with a &s;harp knife ready to cut it in a moment, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity. If the whale return for air to breathe, the harpooner takes the opportunity to give him a fre&s;h wound, till fainting by lo&s;s of blood, from re|peated wounds, the men &s;eize that moment for ap|proaching him, and thru&s;ting a long &s;teel lance un|der his gills, into his brea&s;t, and through the inte&s;|tines, &s;oon di&s;patch him. When the carca&s;e begins to float, they cut holes in the fins and tail, and tying a rope in them, tow him to the ve&s;&s;el, where he is fa&s;tened to the larboard &s;ide of the &s;hip, floating upon his back, almo&s;t level with the &s;ea.</P>

<SP>

<P>You will do right; for a Green|land whale catcher is a much more valuable mem|ber of &s;ociety, than an idle man of fortune, who lives on the labours of others. In order to take the blub|ber or fat, from which they procure the oil, and the fins, as they are called, or whalebone, &s;everal men get upon the fi&s;h, equipped with a kind of iron caulkers or &s;purs, to prevent their &s;lipping, and cut off the tail, which is hoi&s;ted on deck, and then cut &s;quare pieces of blubber, weighing two or three thou&s;and pounds, which are hoi&s;ted on board with the cap&s;tan, where each piece is again divided into &s;maller pieces, of two or three hundred pounds weight, then the&s;e are thrown into the hold, and left for a few days to drain. When all the blubber is cut from off the bel|ly of the fi&s;h, it is turned on one &s;ide, by means of a piece of blubber, left in the middle, called the cant or turning piece: thus they are cut out the &s;ides in large pieces, which they call hockies. The next operation is to cut out the two large jaw bones, &s;ituated in the under lip, which when hoi&s;ted on deck, are clean&s;ed, and fa&s;tened to the &s;hrouds, with tubs placed under them to catch the oil which they di&s;charge. The carca&s;e is left to float, and &s;upplies food for Green|land birds, called mallemuck, &amp;c. After the pieces of blubber have lain a few days in the hold, they hoi&s;t them on deck, cut them into &s;mall pieces, and put them through the bung holes into their ca&s;ks; one of the large&s;t fi&s;h will fill more than &s;eventy butts. The produce of a good large whale is valued at about one thou&s;and pounds. When thus richly laden, they begin to &s;ail homewards with their &s;poil:
<PB N="16" REF="036664_0015_100A5F57F6E45288">
on their return, the fat is to be boiled, and melted down into train-oil. The whale fi&s;hery begins in May, and continues through the months of June and July. Whether the &s;hips are &s;ucce&s;sful or not, they mu&s;t come away, and get clear of the ice before the end of Augu&s;t.</P>

<P>I thank you, my dear papa, for this very entertaining account. I &s;hall never &s;ee a piece of whalebone, but I &s;hall think of the labours and diffi|culties of the poor Greenland &s;ailors.</P>

<P>I am glad to hear you were plea&s;ed with la&s;t night's conver&s;ation; it is a proof that your minds are capable of reli&s;hing national amu&s;ement. An early habit of trifling is difficult to be &s;ubdued, and &s;hould be carefully avoided; thou|&s;ands are rendered unhappy by it; for having never been accu&s;tomed to exerci&s;e their faculties, as they grow up, they find every thing fatiguing that re|quires reflection, and as the mind cannot re&s;t wholly inactive, they fly from one trifling, u&s;ele&s;s pur&s;uit, to another; always tired of them&s;elves, and rendering no benefit to others; but a well-regulated mind is marked by the judicious di&s;po&s;al of time, converting even amu&s;ement into in&s;truction.

<SPEAKER>AUGUSTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thank you for the&s;e directions, and will begin to-morrow; but I have hindered Mr. Har|court from begining his account of the cod.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>The cod is a fi&s;h of pa&s;&s;age, and is found from eighteen inches to three or four feet long, with a great head, and teeth in the bottom of the throat, its fle&s;h white, its &s;kin browni&s;h on the back, and covered with a few tran&s;parent &s;cales. It eats excellent, when fre&s;h; and if well prepared and &s;alted, will keep a long time. Salt-fi&s;h or &s;tock-fi&s;h, commonly eaten in lent, is cod thus prepared. There are two kinds of &s;alt cod, the one called green or white, the other dried or cured. The mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential thing in the green cod fi&s;hery, is the &s;kill of the per|&s;ons
<PB N="19" REF="036664_0018_100A5F5F8F7CF358">
employed to open the fi&s;h, to cut off the heads, and to &s;alt them, upon which la&s;t the &s;ucce&s;s of the voyage chiefly depends. The principal fi&s;hery for cod is on the banks of Newfoundland, in North-A|merica; and the be&s;t &s;ea&s;on, from the beginning of February to the end of April, when the cod, which during the winter, had retired to the deepe&s;t part of the &s;ea, return to the bank, and grow very fat. Each fi&s;her takes but one cod at a time, yet the more experienced will catch from three hundred and fifty, to four hundred every day. This is a very fatiguing employment, both on account of the weight of the fi&s;h, and the extreme cold which reigns on the bank. They &s;alt the cod on board. The head being cut off, the belly opened, and the guts taken out, the &s;alter ranges them in the bottom of the ve&s;&s;el, head to tail, and having thus made a layer of them, a fathom or two &s;quare, he covers them with &s;alt, over this he places another layer of fi&s;h, which he covers as be|fore; and thus he di&s;po&s;es all the fi&s;h of that day, taking care never to mix the fi&s;h of different days to|gether. By the time they have lain three or four days thus to drain, they are removed into another part of the ve&s;&s;el, and &s;alted again: then they are left untouched till the &s;hip has got its load, unle&s;s they put them in barrels for the conveniency of room.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>The curing and taking of cod mu&s;t be le&s;s di&s;agreeable and dangerous than whale-catching. I had no idea that the catching of fi&s;h alone employ|ed &s;o many men.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are apt to u&s;e and con&s;ume the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniences of life, without re|flecting on the pains and labour nece&s;&s;ary to obtain them. The &s;malle&s;t dome&s;tic accommodation is fre|quently not to be had, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ever|al hands; a pin or needle, for in&s;tance, employs a great number of workmen, before they are brought to the degree of perfection in which we receive them. And the &s;upply of a common table, if we con&s;ider the re&s;ources from which it is drawn, mo&s;t probably em|ploys
<PB N="20" REF="036664_0019_100A5F63A172F918">
the time and labour of thou&s;ands; but we in|terrupt your father from proceeding, this &s;ubject may be re&s;umed another time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the fi&s;hing for dry cod, ve&s;|&s;els of various &s;izes are u&s;ed, though &s;uch are gene|rally cho&s;en as have large holds, becau&s;e this kind of fi&s;h encumbers more than it burthens. As cod can only be dried by the &s;un, the European ve&s;&s;els are obliged to put out in March or April, in order to have the benefit of the &s;ummer for drying. Indeed the Engli&s;h &s;end ve&s;&s;els for cod later, but they only purcha&s;e of the inhabitants what had been caught and prepared before hand. In exchange for which, we carry them meal, brandies, bi&s;cuits, pul&s;e, mo|la&s;&s;es, linen, &amp;c. The fi&s;h cho&s;en for this purpo&s;e, though the &s;ame &s;pecies as the green cod, is yet much &s;maller. As &s;oon as the captains arrive, they unrig all the ve&s;&s;els, leaving nothing but the &s;hrouds to &s;u&s;tain the ma&s;ts; and, in the mean while, the mates provide a tent on &s;hore, covered with branches of fir, and &s;ails over them, with a &s;caffold, fifty or &s;ixty feet long, and about one third as broad. While the &s;caffold is making ready, the crew are fi&s;hing, and as fa&s;t as they catch, they bring their fi&s;h, open them, and &s;alt them on moveable benches; but the main &s;alting is performed on the &s;caffold, called flake. When the fi&s;h have taken &s;alt, they wa&s;h them, and lay them on piles, on the galleries of the &s;caffold, to drain again; when &s;ufficiently drained, they are ranged on hurdles, a fi&s;h thick, head again&s;t tail, with the back uppermo&s;t; ob&s;erving, while they lie thus, to turn and &s;hift them four times every twenty-four hours. When they begin to dry, they lay them in heaps of ten or twelve a piece, to retain their warmth, and continue to enlarge the heap eve|ry day, till it becomes double its fir&s;t bulk. At length they join two of the&s;e heaps into one, which they turn every day as before; la&s;tly, &s;alt them over again, beginning with tho&s;e that had been &s;alted fir&s;t, and in this &s;tate lay them in huge piles, as big as hay-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">cks;
<PB N="21" REF="036664_0020_100A5F652625F5F0">
and thus they remain till they are carried on &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ip board, where they are laid on branches of trees, di&s;po&s;ed for that purpo&s;e, in the bottom of the ve&s;&s;el, with mats around them, to prevent their contracting any moi&s;ture. There are four kinds of commodities drawn from cod; the &s;ounds, which is a jelly like &s;ub&s;tance, that covers the in&s;ide of the main bone, and the tongues are &s;alted at the &s;ame time with the fi&s;h, and barrelled up for eating. The roes or eggs being &s;alted and barrelled, are u&s;eful to ca&s;t into the &s;ea, to draw fi&s;h together, particularly pilchards; and la&s;tly the oil, which is u&s;ed in dre&s;&s;ing of leather; and thus, by the art and ingenuity of man, every part of this fi&s;h, that can be &s;erviceable is put to u&s;e; and by his &s;kill in curing and drying it, a large &s;up|ply of whole&s;ome provi&s;ion is pre&s;erved, which mu&s;t otherwi&s;e be lo&s;t. Nor is this care be&s;towed on the cod alone; the herring &s;upplies food to va&s;t numbers of families, e&s;pecially the poorer &s;ort, to whom they are a great relief, when other provi&s;ions are dear; but perhaps you are all tired of this &s;ubject, and wi&s;h to hear no more concerning the catching of fi&s;h; if that be not the ca&s;e, the herring, though a &s;mall fi&s;h, will furni&s;h us with wonders almo&s;t as extraordinary as the whale.</P>

<P>It is not any thing remarkable in the con&s;truction of the individual fi&s;h, to which I al|lude, but to the prodigious numbers in which they a&s;&s;emble, at certain &s;ea&s;ons of they year. About the beginning of June, a &s;hoal of herrings, in bulk not le&s;s than the whole extent of Great-Britain and Ire|land, comes from the north, on the &s;urface of the &s;ea; their approach is known to the inhabitants of Shetland (an i&s;land to the north of Scotland) by &s;ev|eral

tokens in the air and water, as by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ds, &s;uch as gannets, &amp;c. which follow, in order to prey upon them; and by the &s;moothne&s;s of the water. It is not certainly known whence they come, though it is pro|bable, that their winter rendezvous is within the arc|tic circle, where the &s;eas &s;warm with infect food in greater abundance than in our warmer latitudes. They ca&s;t their &s;pawn, when they arrive in the&s;e &s;eas, for they come to us full, and are &s;hotten long before they leave us. The great &s;hoal divides into columns of five or &s;ix miles in length, and three or four in breadth, reflecting, in bright weather, as they pa&s;s, many &s;plendid colours.</P>

<P>Pray, papa, what kind of fi&s;h is the her|ring? I am not at all acquainted with it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>The herring is a &s;mall &s;alt-water fi&s;h, with a blui&s;h back, and a white &s;ilvered belly. It is commonly &s;aid that nobody ever &s;aw a herring alive, they die &s;o immediately on being taken out of the water; but there have been in&s;tances to the con|trary. By what I have already told you, you will perceive that the herring is a fi&s;h of pa&s;&s;age; they go chiefly in &s;hoals, and are fond of following any fire or light; indeed, as they pa&s;s, they re&s;emble a kind of lightning them&s;elves, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> colours glancing again&s;t the &s;un. The method of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ing and curing herrings
<PB N="23" REF="036664_0022_100A5F688EB64BE0">
is &s;imple; there are two ways of doing it, the one makes white or pickled herring, the other what is called red herring. The white or pickled herring is prepared by cutting open and gutting the fi&s;h, as &s;oon as it is taken out of the water, but the milts and roes are always left in; they are then wa&s;hed in fre&s;h water, and left for twelve or fifteen hours in a tub full of &s;trong brine, made of fre&s;h water and &s;ea &s;alt. They are then taken out and drained, and when well drained, put up in barrels, di&s;po&s;ed evenly in rows or layers, pre&s;&s;ed well down, and a layer of &s;alt &s;trewed over them at top and bottom. After wa&s;h|ing, gutting, and &s;alting the fi&s;h, as above, when they intend to make them red herrings, they &s;tring them by the head on little wooden &s;pits, and hang them in a kind of chimney, made for the purpo&s;e, and when the chimney is filled, which generally re|quires ten or twelve thou&s;and fi&s;h, they make a fire underneath of bru&s;h-wood, which yields much &s;moke, but no flame, which mo&s;tly dries them &s;ufficiently in twenty-four hours; they are then barrelled for keep|ing. The&s;e are the mo&s;t important fi&s;heries, and employ by far the greate&s;t number of people; though there are many poor men who live on the &s;ea coa&s;ts, who&s;e &s;canty &s;ub&s;i&s;tence depends on the dangerous and precarious employment of fi&s;hing; a little boat is their chief trea&s;ure, in which they venture out in rough and boi&s;terous weather, when the pre&s;&s;ing wants of their family urge them to the undertaking.</P>

<P>When I was at Bally&s;hannon, I pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal hours in watching the fi&s;h leap up the ca&s;cade, and it is hardly credible, but to tho&s;e who have been eye-witne&s;&s;es, that they &s;hould be able to dart them&s;elves near fourteen feet perpendicularly out of the water; and, allowing for the curvature, they leap at lea&s;t twenty. They do not always &s;uc|ceed at the fir&s;t leap; &s;ometimes they bound almo&s;t to the &s;ummit, but the falling water da&s;hes them down again; at other times they dart head foremo&s;t, or &s;ide-long upon a rock, remain &s;tunned for a few moments, and then &s;truggle into the water again; whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they are &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful as to reach the top, they &s;wim out of &s;ight in a moment. They do not bound from the &s;urface of the water, and it cannot be known from what depth they take their leap; it is probably performed by a forcible &s;pring with their tails bent; for the chief &s;trength of mo&s;t fi&s;h lies in the tail. They have often been &s;hot, or caught with &s;trong barbed hooks fixed to a pole, during their flight, as it may be termed; and in&s;tances have been known of women catching them in their aprons. At high water, the fall is hardly three feet, and then the fi&s;h &s;wim up that ea&s;y acclivity without leaping. Some|times I have &s;een at low water fifty or &s;ixty of the&s;e leaps in an hour, and at other times only two or three. I placed my&s;elf on a rock on the brink of the ca&s;|cade, &s;o that I had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing the &s;urpri&s;|ing efforts of the&s;e beautiful fi&s;h clo&s;e to me; and at the bottom of the fall, porpoi&s;es and &s;eals tumbling and playing among the waves; and &s;ometimes a &s;eal carries off a &s;almon under his fins.</P>

<P>It was an object to which I paid particular attention. It is &s;ituated at the northern extremity of the i&s;land. It con&s;i&s;ts of about thirty thou&s;and natural pillars, mo&s;tly in a perpendicular &s;ituation. At low water the cau&s;eway is about &s;ix hundred feet long, and probably runs far into the &s;ea, as &s;omething &s;imilar is ob&s;erved on the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t of Scotland. It is not known whether the pillars are continued under ground, like a quarry. They are of different dimen&s;ions, being from fif|teen to twenty-&s;ix inches in diameter, and from fif|teen to thirty-&s;ix feet in height: their figure is gen|erally pentagonal or hexagonal. Several have been found with &s;even, and a few with three, four, and eight &s;ides, of irregular &s;izes; every pillar con&s;i&s;ts
<PB N="29" REF="036664_0028_100A5F7580F3FCF0">
as it were of joints or pieces, which are not united by flat &s;urfaces; for on being forced off, one of them is concave in the middle, and the other convex, many of the&s;e joints lie loo&s;e upon the &s;trand. The &s;tone is a kind of be&s;altes, of a clo&s;e grit, and of a du&s;ky hue; it is very heavy, each joint generally weigh|ing two hundred and a half. It clinks like iron, melts in a forge, breaks &s;harp, and by rea&s;on of its extreme hardne&s;s, blunts the edges of tools, and by that means is rendered incapable of being u&s;ed in building. The pillars &s;tand very clo&s;e to each oth|er, and though the number of their &s;ides differ, yet their contextures are &s;o nicely adapted, as to leave no vacuity between them, and every pillar retains its own thickne&s;s, angles, and &s;ides, from top to bottom.

<P>This is a wonderful account. It &s;eems to be one of tho&s;e productions of nature that may be termed an unique. I know of nothing &s;imi|lar to it. I met with a pa&s;&s;age, la&s;t night, in Collin|&s;on's Hi&s;tory of Somer&s;et, though not immediately referring to the &s;ubject before us, that I cannot re&s;i&s;t the plea&s;ure of repeating. It is concerning a pecul|iar property of the limpet (a &s;pecies of &s;hell-fi&s;h,) that is found at Minehead in that county; that contains a liquor curious for marking linen. When the &s;hell is picked off, there will appear a white vein lying tran&s;ver&s;ely in a little furrow next the head of the fi&s;h, which may be taken out by a bodkin, or any other pointed in&s;trument. The letters or figures made with this liquor will pre&s;ently appear of a light green col|our, and if placed in the &s;un, will change into the following colours; if in winter, about noon; if in &s;ummer, an hour or two after &s;un-ri&s;ing; and &s;o much before &s;etting; for in the heat of the day in &s;ummer, it will come on &s;o fa&s;t, that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
<PB N="30" REF="036664_0029_100A5F7810B4AC20">
each colour will &s;carcely be di&s;tingui&s;hed. Next to the fir&s;t light green, it will appear of a deep green, and in a few minutes change to a full &s;ea green; af|ter which, in a few minutes more, it will alter to a blue, then to a purpli&s;h red: after which, lying an hour or two, (if the &s;un &s;hines) it will be of a deep purple red, beyond which the &s;un does no more. But this la&s;t beautiful colour, after wa&s;hing in &s;cald|ing water and &s;oap, will, on being laid out to dry, be a fair bright crim&s;on, which will abide all future wa&s;hing.

<P>All &s;alt becomes white by grind|ing.

I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to de&s;cribe the manner of procuring this kind of &s;alt, before I &s;ay any thing of the other &s;orts. The account of the Poli&s;h mines, in the village of Wili&s;ka, five leagues from Cracow, the capital of Poland, which were di&s;covered in the year 1251, will furni&s;h us with an idea of them, that will &s;erve for a de&s;cription of &s;alt mines in general. Their depth and capacity are &s;urpri&s;ing. Within them exi&s;ts a kind of &s;ubterraneous republic, or common|wealth, which has its policy, laws, families, &amp;c. nay, even public roads, for hor&s;es and carriages, are kept here, for the purpo&s;e of drawing the &s;alt to the mouth of the quarry, where it is taken up by engines. The&s;e hor&s;es, when they are once down, never &s;ee the light again; but the men take frequent occa&s;ions.

of breathing the fre&s;h air. What a&s;toni&s;hment mu&s;t a traveller feel, on arriving at the bottom of this wonderful aby&s;s, where &s;o many people are interred alive, and numbers of them even born there, that have never &s;een day light.

The &s;alt mines of Catalonia are found in the moun|tains of the Duchy of Cordona; they form a &s;olid mountain of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ck &s;alt, between four and five hun|dred feet in height, and a league in circumference, and de&s;cending to an unknown depth below the &s;ur|face. This prodigious mountain of &s;alt, which has no mixture of other matter with it, is e&s;teemed a great natural curio&s;ity, and has rai&s;ed a doubt among naturali&s;ts, whether &s;alt does not vegetate or grow. To give you an imperfect idea of the quantities of &s;alt produced annually, it is &s;aid, that one of the Norwich pits, which is in Che&s;hire, has yielded, at a medium, four thou&s;and tons of &s;alt in a year. The &s;alt is e&s;teemed unfit for dome&s;tic u&s;es, in its natural &s;tate; and therefore they u&s;e the method practi&s;ed in Poland, Hungary, and many other places, on the coar&s;er rock &s;alt; they refine it, by di&s;&s;olving it in weak brine, and then boiling it into &s;alt again. The works, where the rock &s;alt is refined, are called Re|fine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ies. The rock &s;alt is broken &s;mall, and put into leaded ci&s;terns, where it is di&s;&s;olved in cold &s;ea-water, when the &s;olution has &s;tood a day and night to &s;ettle, it is drawn off from the &s;ediment into the &s;alt-pan, and refined into &s;alt in the &s;ame manner that common &s;alt is boiled up. The &s;cratch or calcarious matter falling from it, forms a cru&s;t on the &s;ides of the ci&s;t|ern. They are careful not to wa&s;te the brine le&s;t in the pans after the &s;alt is taken out, but add it to the next quantity put into the pan, and &s;o on to the end

of the works. I cannot di&s;mi&s;s the &s;ubject of rock &s;alt, without mentioning the i&s;land of Toongming, in the Ea&s;t-Indies, which affords the mo&s;t remarka|ble kind of fo&s;&s;ile, or native dry &s;alt, in the world. The country is, in general, very fruitful, but in cer|tain parts of the i&s;land there are &s;pots of ground, of &s;everal acres, which appear wholly barren, yielding not the lea&s;t appearance of any thing vegetable on them. The&s;e &s;pots of ground ta&s;te very &s;alt, and a|bound with &s;alt in &s;uch a manner, as not only to &s;upply the whole i&s;land, but a great part of the neighbouring continent.</P>

<P>When the inhabitants perceive the ground become dry, and covered with white &s;pangles, which are pieces of &s;alt, they are &s;ufficiently a&s;&s;ured that this is a proper place to dig for that com|modity. It is very remarkable that the &s;ame pieces of land, which produce vegetables one year, will produce this &s;alt another; and on the contrary, the &s;alt parts will, &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons, be covered with vegeta|tion. The &s;alt work in this i&s;land is of great advan|tage to the inhabitants, and &s;upplies all the poor, during the &s;ea&s;on, with employment. The men are occupied in collecting the &s;alt and wetting the earth, and the women in boiling up the water, which they attend as carefully as the men. The &s;econd kind of &s;alt is marine or &s;ea &s;alt, which is made from &s;ea wa|ter, thickened by repeated evaporation, and at length cry&s;tallized.</P>

<P>Heat cau&s;ed either by the action of the &s;un or fire, makes the watery particles of &s;ea-water fly off, or di&s;per&s;e into the air, and leave the &s;aline parts at the bottom of the ve&s;&s;el, which is cal|led evaporation. The &s;alt, thus deprived of the wa|ter, cry&s;tallizes, or hardens, and &s;hoots into cry&s;tals,
<PB N="37" REF="036664_0036_100A5F8816E3B208">
&s;uch as I &s;hewed you the other day in the micro&s;cope. Opake &s;tones, pyrites, and minerals, when regular|ly formed, are &s;aid to be cry&s;tallized; as well as tran&s;parent &s;tones and &s;alts. Ice will give you the idea of a complete cry&s;tallization, compo&s;ed of long needle-like ma&s;&s;es, flattened on one &s;ide, and joined together in &s;uch a manner, that the &s;maller are in|&s;erted into the &s;ides of the greater. The cry&s;tals of different kinds of &s;alts afford great variety and beauty of forms, and are curious objects of micro&s;copic ob|&s;ervation. The regularity of their figure, each dif|ferent &s;ub&s;tance producing a form appropriate to it|&s;elf, is a confirmation, that not only the more obvi|ous works of nature, but al&s;o the internal &s;tructure of organized bodies, are formed with the &s;ame har|mony, order, and beauty, that characterize the other parts of the creation. Marine &s;alt is prepared by boiling &s;ea-water. The &s;alt-works are erected near the &s;ea, in order to afford an opportunity of convey|ing the &s;alt-water into them by pipes, which is after|wards boiled in pans of an immen&s;e &s;ize. It is nece&s;|&s;ary to have the roofs of wood fa&s;tened with wooden pegs, as the effluvia, which evaporates from the boiling pans, ru&s;ts, and de&s;troys iron in a very little time. Whil&s;t boiling, they purify it with whites of eggs, or &s;ometimes the blood of &s;heep or oxen is u&s;ed for the &s;ame purpo&s;e.

<P>I think we may ob&s;erve in the proce&s;s of &s;alt, as well as many other things, that nature provides materials for man's ingenuity and indu&s;try to work upon; nay, &s;he supplies us with few things, that does not require &s;ome labour to render them &s;uitable for our u&s;e.</P>

life. Much has already been di&s;covered, more per|haps lies &s;till behind; the field is va&s;t, and may &s;up|ply u&s;eful and intere&s;ting occupation for many &s;uc|ceeding generations of men. The third, and la&s;t mind of &s;alt, is prepared in much the &s;ame manner as marine &s;alt, from the water of &s;alt-wells and &s;prings, and is called brine, or fountain &s;alt. The white&s;t, drie&s;t, and fine&s;t grained &s;alt is &s;ometimes made up in form of &s;ugar loaves, in &s;mall wicker ba&s;kets. In preparing ba&s;ket &s;alt, they u&s;e re&s;in, and other addi|tions, to break the grain, and render it very &s;mall; and, to fini&s;h the proce&s;s, it is dried in &s;toves. Great quantities of brine or &s;pring &s;alt are made in mo&s;t of the inland countries, as in Germany, Switzerland, Hungary, and in &s;ome parts of France and England. Lakes of this kind are found in the Podolian de&s;ert, near the river Bory&s;thenes; on the Ru&s;&s;ian frontiers, towards Crim Tartary; in the kingdom of Algiers; and in other countries. Where nature does not &s;up|ply the&s;e lakes or ponds, artificial ones may be made. This is annually done very advantageou&s;ly in France, where the chief coa&s;ts for bay-&s;alt, are tho&s;e of Bre|tagne, Saintonge, and the Pay d'Aunts. In order to make a &s;aline, or &s;alt-mar&s;h, a low plot of ground mu&s;t be cho&s;en adjoining to the &s;ea, and di&s;tant from the mouths of large rivers; and to render it com|plete, it &s;hould be near &s;ome convenient harbour for ve&s;&s;els. The ground thus cho&s;en, mu&s;t be hollowed out to three ponds or receptacles. The fir&s;t, into which the &s;ea-water is admitted, may be called the re&s;ervoir; the &s;econd receptacle, which is to be again divided into three di&s;tinct ponds, communicating with each other by narrow pa&s;&s;ages, and containing brine of different degrees of &s;trength, may be called the brine-ponds; and the third receptacle, is to be furni&s;hed with an entrance, between which and the brine-ponds, there is to run a long narrow winding channel, the re&s;t of it is to be divided into &s;mall pits, containing a very &s;trongly &s;aturated brine, which is to be converted into &s;alt, and they may therefore
<PB N="39" REF="036664_0038_100A5F8C92CF0870">
properly be called the &s;alt-pits. The fir&s;t receptacle mu&s;t communicate with the &s;ea, by a ditch, defended by walls; the ditch &s;hould have a flood-gate to ad|mit, retain, or let out the &s;ea-water, as occa&s;ion may require. The bottoms of the re&s;ervoir, or brine-ponds, are to be lined with any kind of tough clay, or earth, that will hold water. The proper &s;ea&s;on for making &s;alt in the&s;e artificial &s;alinae, is from May to the end of Augu&s;t. When the &s;alt-men open the flood-gate, at the time the tide is out, to drain off all the &s;tag|nating water, and after repairing and clean&s;ing the receptacles from mud and dirt, they admit the &s;ea-water, at the next high tide, till it floats the whole mar&s;h, and &s;tands at a proper height in the re&s;ervoir. In a few days, mo&s;t of the water, in the &s;alt-pits, is exhaled by the power of the &s;un, and what remains is a very &s;trong brine. They daily &s;upply them&s;elves with more &s;alt-water, in proportion to what is exhaled by the &s;un, and the workmen draw out the cry&s;tals or &s;alt, as they are formed every day, and di&s;po&s;e them in a pyramidical heap, which they cover over at the top with thatch or &s;traw, to pre&s;erve it from the injuries of the weather. Thus, at a &s;mall expence and trouble, a &s;alt is prepared, very fit for all do|me&s;tic u&s;es; and France, e&s;pecially, is furni&s;hed with a very profitable article for exportation. The u&s;es of common &s;alt are various and exten&s;ive. Its acid and alkali are employed in many chemical oper|ations in the arts. It is an important ingredient in the fu&s;ion of gla&s;s, which it whitens and purifies. It facilitates the fu&s;ion of the metallic parts of minerals; and its peculiar u&s;e in pre&s;erving meat, &amp;c. and giving a poignancy to the ta&s;te of various kinds of food, is univer&s;ally known. Common &s;alt is al&s;o u&s;e|ful as a manure, by contributing to fertilize the &s;oil.</P>

<P>Beaver or Ca&s;tor, makes a di&s;tinct ge|nus of animals of the order of <HI>Glires,</HI> and cla&s;s of <HI>Mammalia.</HI> The characters are, that the upper fore teeth are truncated, and hollowed obliquely, and that the lower are oblique at the apex; with a flat tail, and feet which have five toes on each, and palms adapted to &s;wimming. Under this genus are comprehended three &s;pecies. The Beaver or Fiber. Se|condly, the Ca&s;tor. Thirdly the Ca&s;tor, called <HI>Zibethicus.</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well defined, with the meth|od and preci&s;ion of a naturali&s;t. Give us now a de|&s;cription of the animal, and afterwards, its manner of living and habits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Beaver is about four feet in length, and twelve or fifteen inches broad; his &s;kin in the northern regions is generally black; but it brightens into a reddi&s;h hue, in the temperate climates. He is covered with two &s;orts of hair, one long, and the other a &s;oft down; the latter, which is an inch in length, is extremely fine and compact, and furni&s;hes the animal with a nece&s;&s;ary degree of warmth, the long hair pre&s;erves the down from dirt and wet. The head is like that of the otter, but longer, the &s;nout is pretty long, the eyes &s;mall, the ears &s;hort, round and hairy on the out&s;ide, but &s;mooth within, and the teeth very long, the under teeth project the breadth of three fingers, and the upper, half a finger, all of which are broad, crooked, &s;trong and &s;harp; be&s;ides tho&s;e teeth, which are called inci&s;ors, which grow double, are &s;et very deep in their jaws, and bend like the edge of an axe; they have &s;ixteen grinders, eight on each &s;ide, four above, and four below, directly oppo&s;ite to each other. With the former, they are able to cut down trees of a con&s;iderable &s;ize; with the latter, to break the harde&s;t &s;ub&s;tances; the legs
<PB N="42" REF="036664_0041_100A5F932FF1AE80">
are &s;hort, the fore-legs not exceeding four or five inches in length, the fore-paws are formed &s;ome|thing like the human hand. The&s;e feet &s;erve the beaver to dig, &s;often, and work the clay for different purpo&s;es, the hind feet are furni&s;hed with membranes, or large &s;kins, extending between the toes, like tho&s;e of ducks, and other water-fowl; the tail is long, a little flat, entirely covered with &s;cales, &s;upplied with mu&s;cles, and perpetually moi&s;tened with oil or fat, which the creature di&s;tributes all over them with his &s;nout, and which he procures from &s;our bags, which are placed under the inte&s;tines, and are found in ev|ery beaver, whether male or female. The&s;e bags are filled with a re&s;inous liquid &s;ub&s;tance, which, when it is ejected, &s;ettles into a thick con&s;i&s;tence. Phy&s;icians call it ca&s;toreum, and pre&s;cribe it as an excellent remedy again&s;t poi&s;ons, vapours, and other maladies, but when it grows old, it blackens, and degenerates into a dangerous poi&s;on.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Before Sophia relates the man|ners and occupations of this creature, let us give par|ticular attention to the implements with which na|ture has furni&s;hed it. The form and &s;trength of the teeth are &s;uited to cutting of wood and hard &s;ub&s;tan|ces, and we have already been told that with the&s;e they are able to fell trees; the fore-paws are adapted to handling and di&s;po&s;ing the materials of the work; the hind-feet are formed for &s;wimming, and evident|ly &s;hew that the creature is intended to live in both elements, and is what is called an amphibious animal: the tail, from its flatne&s;s, and the hardne&s;s of its &s;cales, may &s;erve very well for a hod, &s;uch as bricklayers u&s;e for carrying mortar, &amp;c. And now, Augu&s;ta, do you think it totally improbable, that a creature fur|ni&s;hed with &s;uch tools, and endued with a propor|tionable degree of &s;agacity to u&s;e them, &s;hould be a|ble to con&s;truct hou&s;es of three &s;tories, or build bridges, &amp;c.</P>

<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>When they are going to chu&s;e a place to build a habitation, they a&s;&s;emble in companies &s;ome|times of two or three hundred, and after mature de|liberation, fix on a &s;pot where plenty of provi&s;ions, and all nece&s;&s;aries may be found. Their hou&s;es are always &s;ituated in the water; and when they can find neither lake nor pond adjacent, they endeavour to &s;upply the defect, by &s;topping the current of &s;ome brook or &s;mall river, by means of a cau&s;ey or dam; for this purpo&s;e they &s;et about felling of trees, which &s;everal of them together effect pretty ea&s;ily, with their &s;trong teeth; they take care to chu&s;e out tho&s;e that grow above the place where they intend to build, that they may &s;wim down the current. They al&s;o, with wonderful &s;agacity, contrive that they &s;hall fall towards the water, that they may have the le&s;s way to carry them. After the tree is felled, they cut it into proper lengths, and then roll them into the wa|ter, and navigate them towards the place where they are to be u&s;ed. The cau&s;ey rai&s;ed with the&s;e pieces of wood, is &s;ometimes ten or a dozen feet in thick|ne&s;s at the foundation; it de&s;cends in a &s;lope on the &s;ide next the water. The oppo&s;ite &s;ide is rai&s;ed per|pendicularly like our walls, and the &s;lope, which at its ba&s;e, is twelve feet broad, dimini&s;hes towards the top to the breadth of two feet. They drive the ex|tremities of the&s;e pieces of wood very near each oth|er, into the earth, and interlace them with other &s;takes more &s;lender and &s;upple. But as the water, without &s;ome other prevention, would glide through the cavities, and leave the re&s;ervoir dry, they have recour&s;e to a clay, which they perfectly well know how to procure, and which they work up into a kind of mortar with their tails, and clo&s;e up the inter|&s;tices with it, both within and without, and this en|tirely &s;ecures the water from pa&s;&s;ing away. If the violence of the water, or the foot&s;teps of hunters, who pa&s;s over their work, damage it, they immedi|ately
<PB N="44" REF="036664_0043_100A5F98B1F1FAF0">
&s;et about repairing it. They build their cab|ins, either on piles in the middle of the &s;mall lakes, they have thus formed, on the bank of a river, or at the extremity of &s;ome point of land, that advances into a lake. The figure of them is round or oval, divided into three partitions, rai&s;ed one above anoth|er. The fir&s;t is &s;unk below the level of the dike, and is generally full of water, the other two &s;tories are built above it. The whole edifice is mo&s;tly capable of containing eight or ten inhabitants. Each beaver has its peculiar cell a&s;&s;igned him, the floor of which he &s;trews with leaves, or &s;mall branches of the pine tree, &s;o as to render it clean and comfortable. Their works, e&s;pecially in the cold regions, are completed in Augu&s;t or September; after which they furni&s;h them&s;elves with a &s;tore of provi&s;ions. During the &s;ummer, they regale upon all the fruits and plants the country produces. In the winter they eat the wood of the a&s;h, the plane, and other trees, which they &s;teep in water, in quantities proportionable to their con&s;umption, and they are &s;upplied with a dou|ble &s;tomach, to facilitate the dige&s;tion of &s;uch &s;olid food, at two operations. They cut twigs from three to &s;ix feet in length, the larger ones are conveyed by &s;everal beavers to the magazine, and the &s;maller by a &s;ingle animal, but they take different ways. Each individual has his walk a&s;&s;igned him, to prevent the labourers from being interrupted in their re&s;pective occupations. The&s;e parcels of wood are not piled up in one continued heap, but laid acro&s;s one anoth|er with inter&s;tices between them, that they may the ea&s;ier draw out what quantity they want; and they always take the parcel at the bottom. They cut this wood into &s;mall pieces, and convey it to their cell, where the whole family come to receive their &s;hare. Sometimes they wander in the woods, and regale their young with a fre&s;h collation. The hun|ters, who know that the&s;e creatures love green wood better than old, place a parcel of the former about their lodge, and then have &s;everal devices to en&s;nare
<PB N="45" REF="036664_0044_100A5F9B0FC2C270">
them. When the winter grows &s;evere, they &s;ome|times break the ice, and when the beavers come to the opening for air, they kill them with hatchets, or make a large aperture in the ice, and cover it with a very &s;trong net, and then overturn the lodge, upon which the beavers, thinking to e&s;cape in their u&s;ual way, by flying to the water, and immerging at the hole in the ice, fall into the &s;nare, and are taken.</P>

When the hair is off, they mix the &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ff, put|ting to one third of dry ca&s;tor, two thirds of old coat, a term they u&s;e for the hair of tho&s;e &s;kins which have been worn &s;ome time by the &s;avages, and by that means is become finer than the re&s;t. After it is mixed, they card it; which is pulling it &s;mooth and even, between two things re&s;embling a curry-comb, with fine teeth: &s;uch as are u&s;ed to card wool with, before it is &s;pun. They then take a proper quanti|ty of this &s;tuff for a hat, and put it upon the hurdle, which is a &s;quare table with chinks cut through it lengthwi&s;e, then the workman takes an in&s;trument, called a bow, very like a fiddle-&s;tick, and works the fur till it mixes well together, the dirt and filth pa&s;|&s;ing through the chinks. In this manner they form
<PB N="46" REF="036664_0045_100A5F9D028EA9C0">
two gores or pieces of an oval form, ending in a &s;harp corner at top. The&s;e pieces, or capades, as they are called, being formed in this manner, they proceed to harden them into clo&s;er and more con|&s;i&s;tent flakes, by pre&s;&s;ing them with a hardening &s;kin or leather; they are then carried to the ba&s;on, which is a &s;ort of bench, with an iron plate fitted in it, and a little fire underneath it, upon which they lay one of the capades, &s;prinkled with water, and make u&s;e of a &s;ort of mould to form it; when, by means of the heat of the fire, the water, and pre&s;&s;ing, the &s;ub|&s;tance thickens into a &s;light hairy &s;ort of felt or &s;tuff. After they have turned up the edges all round the mould, they lay it by, and proceed in the &s;ame man|ner with the other half. The next thing is to join the two pieces together, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o as to meet in a point at the top, and form a high crowned cap. The hat thus ba&s;oned, is removed to a large receiver or trough, which is a kind of copper kettle, of a peculiar &s;hape, filled with hot water and grounds, after dipping the hat in the kettle, they begin to work it, by rolling and unrolling it again and again, fir&s;t with their hands, and then with a little wooden roller, dipping it frequently in the kettle, till by fulling and thick|ening it in this manner for four or five hours, it is brought into the &s;ize of the hat intended; they form the crown by laying the high crowned cap on a wooden block of a proper &s;ize, and tying it round with a packthread, called a commander, which they gradually pu&s;h down to the bottom of the block, with a piece of iron properly bent, which they call a &s;tamper. When the hat is dried, they &s;inge it, and rub it with pumice, to take off the coar&s;er knap, it is afterwards rubbed with &s;eal-&s;kin, and la&s;tly carded with a fine card.</P>

to the dyer's, who makes a dye of log-wood, verde-grea&s;e, copperas, and alder-bark, and fills his copper with it, which is mo&s;tly large enough to hold ten or twelve dozen of hats at a time. He boils the hats in this dye for near an hour, then &s;ets them out to cool, and boils them again ten or more times over, till the dye is complete; it is now returned to the hatter, who dries it thoroughly over a charcoal fire, and then &s;mears it with glue, or gum &s;enegal di&s;|&s;olved, to &s;tiffen it. The next thing is to &s;team it on the &s;teaming-ba&s;on, which is a little hearth or fire|place, covered over with an iron plate that exactly fits it; on this plate, wet cloths are &s;pread to pre|vent the hat from burning, the hat is placed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">im downwards on it, and rubbed gently with the hand, till &s;ufficiently &s;teamed, and dried; it is then put a|gain upon the block, and bru&s;hed and ironed with flat-irons, &s;uch as are u&s;ed for ironing linen, which &s;moothens and poli&s;hes it, and nothing now remains to be done, but to clip the edges, and few a lining into the crown.</P>

<P>I &s;uppo&s;e there is no manner of doubt, as mamma has already told us, that they defend the fi&s;h again&s;t many injuries; but I read a little while ago, that they are not a perfect &s;ecurity again&s;t all.

<P>A vi&s;it to the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum, in com|pany with a friend of my papa's, who is a collector of &s;hells, has rendered me capable of re&s;olving that que&s;tion; they are generally divided into three cla&s;&s;es, Univalves, bivalves, and multivalves; which include &s;ea, land, and fre&s;h-water &s;hells, which are &s;ubdivid|ed into many genera and &s;pecies. The fir&s;t cla&s;s con&s;i&s;ts of &s;hells that are of one &s;ingle piece; as a

<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Remember, my dear, that the &s;acred writings contain a hi&s;tory of the miraculous interpo&s;ition of Divine Providence, in teaching man|kind the mo&s;t holy and pure religion, from the ear|lie&s;t ages to the glorious di&s;pen&s;ation of the Go&s;pel. Can we then be &s;urpri&s;ed, that they &s;hould contain things out of the cour&s;e of nature? the very e&s;&s;ence of a miricle is, that an effect is produced which can only be accounted for by the influence of a &s;uper|natural power. In the rude ages of gro&s;s ignorance, when the wor&s;hip of idols was almo&s;t univer&s;al, &s;ome &s;triking in&s;tances of a miraculous di&s;play of divine

power was nece&s;&s;ary to convince men, that a God exi&s;ted, who had created all things, and who gov|erned them with an all-&s;eeing eye. The children of I&s;rael were cho&s;en as a peculiar people, among whom were di&s;played the&s;e extraordinary manife&s;ta|tions of the divine Pre&s;ence, that by their means the wor&s;hip of the One True God might &s;upplant the adoration paid to the &s;un, moon, &s;tars, animals of various kinds, and even to &s;tocks and &s;tones, by the different nations of the earth. The multitude of fo&s;&s;ile bodies found in places remote from the &s;ea are an incontrovertible proof of &s;ome violent con|vul&s;ion of nature, and perhaps are permitted to re|main as a monument, to &s;ilence all cavillers on this &s;ubject; but let us re&s;ume the thread of our di&s;cour&s;e: the va&s;t variety of &s;hells that are &s;een in the cabinets of collectors are not all the produce of one &s;ea or one country. Some of the mo&s;t beautiful come from the Ea&s;t-Indies and the Red-Sea.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are various methods of poli&s;hing &s;hells, and adding to their natural beauty. Among the immen&s;e variety of &s;hells with which we are acquainted, &s;ome are taken out of the &s;ea, or found on its &s;hores, in their utmo&s;t perfection, and cannot be improved by the hand of art, their beauti|ful tints being &s;pread upon the &s;urface, and the nat|ural poli&s;h &s;uperior to any that could be given: but in others the beauties are concealed by a cour&s;e outer coat, which the hand of a &s;kilful poli&s;her way remove. Collectors &s;hould have &s;pecimens of the &s;ame &s;pecies, both rough and poli&s;hed, that the naturali&s;t may compare the natural &s;tate with the artificial one. How many fine &s;trokes of nature's pencil in this part of the creation would be entirely concealed from our view, were it not for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an art that unveils and di&s;plays them
<PB N="54" REF="036664_0053_100A5FAFADA889A0">
in full lu&s;tre? A &s;hell that has a &s;mooth &s;urface, and a natural dull poli&s;h, requires only to be rubbed with the hand, or a piece of chamoy leather, or &s;ome tri|poli or fine rotten &s;tone may be u&s;ed, and it will be|come perfectly bright and poli&s;hed; but even this &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> done with caution, for in many &s;hells the lines are only on the &s;urface, and the wearing ever &s;o little of the &s;hell defaces it. A &s;hell that is rough, foul, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;ty, or covered with a tartareous coat, mu&s;t be &s;teeped for &s;ome hours in hot water, then it is to be rubbed with rough emery on a &s;tick, in or|der to get off the coat; after this it may be dipped in diluted aqua-fortis, &s;pirit of &s;alt, or any other acid, and after remaining a few moments in it, be again dipped in common water; then it is to be well rub|bed with &s;oap-&s;uds; after which the operation may be fini&s;hed with fine emery, and, a hair-bru&s;h; and many, to heighten the poli&s;h, rub the &s;hell with a thin &s;olution of gum arabic, or the white of an egg; gloves &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> worn in u&s;ing the aqua-fortis, as it is liable to injure the fle&s;h wherever it touches.

After the &s;hell is cut down as far as is proper, it is to be poli&s;hed with fine emery, tripoli or rotten &s;tone, with a wooden wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">l <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rned by the &s;ame machine as the leaden one. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he&s;e are the principal means u&s;ed in this art, and the changes produced by it, are often &s;o great, that the &s;hell is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot to be known for the &s;ame; for in&s;tance, the onyx or volute is of a &s;imple pale brown in its natural &s;tate, and becomes a fine bright yellow, with only ju&s;t the &s;u|perfices taken off; but if eaten away deeper, appears of a milk white, with a blui&s;h hue towards the bot|tom.

<P>When we go to the &s;ea-&s;ide, in autumn, we may collect &s;hells, and poli&s;h them at our lei&s;ure hours. Among other curio&s;ities that were pointed out to my ob&s;ervation, at the Briti&s;h Mu&s;eum, was a piece of by&s;&s;us, which is a fine cloth, u&s;ed by the ancients, when &s;ilk was rare, made of the threads of the pinna marina, a fi&s;h &s;omewhat like a mu&s;cle, but much larger, and is held in its place in the &s;ame manner, by a prodigious numbe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of very fine threads, which the animal has the power of &s;pinning as it finds occa&s;ion, as the &s;pider and caterpillar do. The&s;e threads have in all times been u&s;ed for the &s;ame pur|po&s;es as &s;ilk. At pre&s;ent they are manufactured at Palermo, the chief city of Sicily, and other places, into gloves, &s;tockings, and different &s;orts of wearing apparel. The method of rendering it fit for u&s;e, is by laying it for a few days in a damp cellar to &s;often, then comb and clean&s;e it; and la&s;tly &s;pin it, in the &s;ame manner as they do &s;ilk. By the&s;e threads, the pinna marina, or &s;ea-wing, as it is &s;ometimes called, &s;u&s;pends it&s;elf to the rocks twenty or thirty feet be|neath the &s;urface of the &s;ea. In this &s;ituation, it is &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully attacked by the eight-footed polypus, that the &s;pecies could not exi&s;t, but for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the cancer pinnotheris, which lives in the &s;ame &s;hell, as a guard and companion. The pinnotheris or pinnophylax is a &s;mall crab, naked like Bernard the hermit, but is furni&s;hed with good eyes, and al|ways inhabits the &s;hell of the pinna; when they want food, the pinna opens its &s;hell, and &s;ends its faithful ally to forage; but if the cancer &s;ees the polypus, he returns &s;uddenly to the arms of his blind ho&s;te&s;s who, by clo&s;ing the &s;hell, avoids the fury of her enemy; otherwi&s;e, when it has procured a booty, it brings it to the opening of the &s;hell, where it is admitted, and they divide the prey.</P>

<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>The general form of the nautilus is adapt|ed to &s;wimming on the water, and re&s;embles the figure of a boat or ve&s;&s;el, but varies in &s;ome particu|lars in the different &s;pecies. The name is derived from a Greek word, &s;ignifying both a fi&s;h and a &s;ai|lor. It is &s;uppo&s;ed that men fir&s;t took the idea of &s;ailing in ve&s;&s;els from what they &s;aw practi&s;ed by this little creature. The paper nautilus is &s;o named from the thinne&s;s of the &s;hell, which it &s;ometimes creeps out of, and goes on &s;hore to feed. When this animal in|tends to &s;ail, it extends two of its arms on high, and &s;upports a membrane between them, which it throws out to &s;erve as a &s;ail, and its two other arms hang out of the &s;hell to be u&s;ed occa&s;ionally as oars, or as a &s;teerage; but this la&s;t office is generally performed by the tail. When the &s;ea is calm, numbers of the&s;e fi&s;h are frequently &s;een diverting them&s;elves with &s;ailing about in this manner, but as &s;oon as a &s;torm ari&s;es, or any thing di&s;turbs them, they draw in their arms, and take in as much water as makes them a little heavier than the &s;ea-water in which they &s;wim, and by that means &s;ink to the bottom. When they de&s;ire to ri&s;e again, they expel this abundant water through a number of holes which they have in their arms, and &s;o lighten them&s;elves.</P>

in&s;tances of the &s;ame admirable wi&s;dom that has formed the inhabitants of the earth and air. Should man ever be enabled, by any future di&s;covery to tra|ver&s;e the bottom of the &s;ea, what wonders would be opened to his view! what numberle&s;s examples of contrivance and &s;agacity, directed by the &s;ame wi&s;|dom, that has in&s;tructed the bee to gather honey, and the beaver to con&s;truct his habitation, would appear! The different contrivances that &s;everal &s;pecies of fi&s;h, who&s;e manners are known, di&s;cover, in the modes of catching their prey, are &s;o wonderful and curious, that I cannot deny my&s;elf the plea&s;ure of relating a few in&s;tances. The &s;turgeon is without teeth, and his mouth placed under the head, like the opening of a pur&s;e, which he has the power of pu&s;hing &s;uddenly out, or retracting. Before this mouth, under the beak or no&s;e, hang four tendrils &s;ome inches long, and which &s;o re&s;emble earth-worms, that at fir&s;t &s;ight they may be mi&s;taken for them. This clum&s;y toothle&s;s fi&s;h is &s;uppo&s;ed by this contrivance to keep him&s;elf in good condition, the &s;olidity of his fle&s;h ev|idently &s;hewing him to be a fi&s;h of prey. He is &s;aid to hide his large body among&s;t the weeds near the &s;ea-coa&s;t, or at the mouths of large rivers, only ex|po&s;ing his irrhi or tendrils, which &s;mall fi&s;h or &s;ea in&s;ects mi&s;taking for real worms, approach for plun|der, and are &s;ucked into the jaws of their enemy. The fle&s;h of the &s;turgeon was &s;o valued in the time of the emperor Severus, that it was brought to table by &s;ervants with coronets on their heads, and pre|ceded by mu&s;ic, which might give ri&s;e to its being in our country pre&s;ented by the lord mayor to the king. At pre&s;ent it is caught in the Danube and the Wolga, the Don, and other large rivers, for vari|ous purpo&s;es. The &s;kin makes the be&s;t covering for carriages; i&s;ingla&s;s is prepared from parts of the &s;kin, cavear from the &s;pawn; and the fle&s;h is pickled or &s;alted, and &s;ent all over Europe, as your father told you in his account of the fi&s;heries. There is a &s;ea in&s;ect de&s;cribed by Mr. Huges, who&s;e claws or ten|tacles

<P>Linnaeus has cla&s;&s;ed them among the zoophytes, which are a kind of intermediate body, &s;uppo&s;ed to partake both of the nature of an animal and a vegetable, as the Greek word from which it is derived, indicates, &s;ignifying plant animal. In the Linnaean &s;y&s;tem, the zoophytes, which con&s;titute the fifth order of worms, are compo&s;ite animals, re&s;em|bling flowers, and &s;pringing from a vegetating &s;tem. This order contains fifteen genera, of which nine are fixed, and have no power of removing from the pla|ces where they are formed; as the i&s;is or red coral, &s;ea-fan or gorgonia, alcyonium, &s;ponge, flu&s;tra, tu|bularia, corallines, &s;ertularia, and vorticella; but the others po&s;&s;e&s;s the faculty of tran&s;porting them&s;elves from one place to another, as the hydra or polype, the pennatula or &s;eapen, toenia, volvex, &s;uria, and chaos, or the a&s;&s;emblage of chaotic or micro&s;copical animals. The &s;pecies under this order are one hun|dred and fifty-&s;ix. The immen&s;e and dangerous rocks built by the &s;warms of coral in&s;ects in the Southern Ocean, which ri&s;e perpendicularly like walls, are de&s;cribed in Cook's Voyages. A point of one of the&s;e rocks broke off, and &s;tuck in the hole that it had made in the bottom of one of the &s;hips, which mu&s;t otherwi&s;e have peri&s;hed by the admi&s;&s;ion of water.</P>

<P>Their prodigious multiplication in all ages of the world is &s;hewn by the numerous lime-&s;tone rocks, which con&s;i&s;t of a congeries or heap of the cells of the&s;e animals, which con&s;titute a great part of the &s;olid earth. Specimens of the&s;e rocks are

It is remarkable that many of tho&s;e found in a fo&s;&s;ile &s;tate, differ from any &s;pecies of the recent ones that are known, and have either been produced in the deep &s;eas, where no human eye can penetrate, or are become extinct. I &s;uppo&s;e, Charles, you can inform us from what coun|try the be&s;t coral comes, and in what manner it is procured.</P>

<P>The fi&s;hing &s;ea&s;on for coral is from A|pril to July. The places are the Per&s;ian Gulf, Red Sea, coa&s;ts of Africa, towards the Ba&s;tion of France, the i&s;les of Majorca and Cor&s;ica, and the coa&s;ts of Provence and Catalonia. Seven or eight men go in a boat: the ca&s;te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> throws the net, which is formed of two beams, tied acro&s;s with a leaden weight to pre&s;s them down. A great quantity of hemp is loo&s;ely twi&s;ted round, among which they mix &s;ome &s;trong nets, and fa&s;ten to the beams; thus prepared it is let down into the &s;ea, and when the coral is pret|ty much entangled, they draw it out by a rope, which &s;ometimes requires half a dozen boats to effect. It is u&s;ed as a medicine in various di&s;ea&s;es.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was formerly ranked among the number of marine plants, but the di&s;coveries of modern naturali&s;ts have rai&s;ed it to the animal king|dom, &s;ince their ob&s;ervations &s;atisfactorily prove that it is the &s;tructure and habitation of certain &s;ea ani|mals, and de&s;igned for their protection and &s;upport. The nature and origin of coral have been as much di&s;puted as any &s;ubject in natural knowledge. Some have con&s;idered coral, and the other &s;imilar produc|tions of the &s;ea as &s;tone. They adopted this opinion from their exce&s;&s;ive hardne&s;s, and &s;pecific gravity, as well as from ob&s;erving that when the&s;e bodies were calcined, they were converted into lime. Kircher
<PB N="61" REF="036664_0060_100A5FBF77A95FD8">
&s;uppo&s;es that there are entire fore&s;ts of it at the bot|tom of the &s;ea, which is not at all improbable, &s;ince M. de Pey&s;onnel has demon&s;trated, by his experi|ments, that it is con&s;tructed by an animal of the polype kind. In forming coral, and other marine productions of this cla&s;s, the animal labours like tho&s;e of the te&s;taceous kind, each according to its &s;pecies, and their productions vary according to their &s;everal forms, magnitudes, and colours. The coral in&s;ect, he ob&s;erves, expands it&s;elf in water, and contracts it|&s;elf in air; or when it is touched with the hand, or when acid liquors are poured upon it; and he actu|ally &s;aw the&s;e in&s;ects move their claws or legs, and expand them&s;elves, when the water in which they were, was placed near the fire. Broken branches of coral have been ob&s;erved to fa&s;ten to other branches. The coral in&s;ects, not having been injured, continue their operations, and as they draw no &s;u&s;tenance from the &s;tone of the coral, they are able to increa&s;e in a detached &s;tate. M. de Pey&s;onnel ob&s;erved that it grows in every direction, &s;ometimes horizontally, &s;ometimes perpendicularly downwards, at other times upwards. Coral then is a ma&s;s of animals of the polype kind, having the &s;ame relation to the polypes united to them, that there is between the &s;hell of a &s;nail, and the &s;nail it&s;elf. Pray, Charles, tell us how many kinds of coral there are?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are three kinds; red, white, and black; the black is the rare&s;t, and mo&s;t e&s;teem|ed; but it is the red that is mo&s;tly u&s;ed in medicine. There is no part of the world where white coral is produced in &s;uch abundance as on the &s;hores of the i&s;land of Ceylon, and other of the neighbouring coa&s;ts. The lime made in tho&s;e countries for building hou&s;es, fortifications, &amp;c. is all prepared by burning this coral. It lies in va&s;t banks, which are uncov|ered at low water, and it is &s;pongy and porous. While young, it is formed erect in &s;hape of little &s;hrubs, and is then firm and &s;olid, with a &s;mooth &s;urface; but the branches continually &s;hoot out, and
<PB N="62" REF="036664_0061_100A5FC1E5E6ED38">
from tho&s;e new branches proceed others, till the whole is one confu&s;ed bu&s;h, which is all covered with a white vi&s;cous matter, which in time hardens upon them, and becomes coral; and this filling up all the inter&s;tices, and hardening between them, renders it one coar&s;e rock.</P>

<P>Sponge is a kind of marine &s;ub|&s;tance, found adhering to rocks, &s;hells, &amp;c. under cover of the &s;ea-water. Naturali&s;ts have till lately been greatly embarra&s;&s;ed in which of the three king|doms to place it; but it is now decidedly allowed to be of &s;ome &s;pecies of worm or polype. The &s;ame M. de Pey&s;onnel has di&s;covered, and de&s;cribed the worms that form four different &s;pecies of &s;ponges; he thinks the &s;ponge is formed from the juice or &s;lav|er, which is depo&s;ited by the worms that inhabit them.</P>

Health and opportunity for improvement, re&s;ult from an early hour; a pale face, languor, and &s;lothfulne&s;s, are the penalties of lying long in bed.

<P>You have convinced me of the advan|tage of ri&s;ing early, and I &s;hall endeavour to be one of the fir&s;t at the grove. Papa has lately given me a fine pearl necklace that was mamma's; my govern|e&s;s tells me that they are not beads, but that they are found in oy&s;ters. I thought I would enquire the next time we met, how they came there, as I &s;uppo&s;e they are no part of the fi&s;h.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Many have been the conjectures of both ancient and modern writers concerning the production of pearls. Some have &s;uppo&s;ed them to proceed from a di&s;ea&s;e of the fi&s;h; but there &s;eems to be a great &s;imilarity between them, and what is found in crabs, called crabs-eyes, which are formed near the &s;tomach of the animal, and &s;erve as a re&s;er|voir of calcareous matter again&s;t the forming of a new &s;hell, at which time they are di&s;&s;olved, and depo&s;ited for that purpo&s;e. As the internal part of the &s;hell of the pearl, oy&s;ter, or mu&s;cle, con&s;i&s;ts of mother pearl, which re&s;embles the material of pearl, and as the an|imal has annually occa&s;ion to enlarge his &s;hell, there is rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that the loo&s;e pearls are &s;imilar re&s;ervoirs of the pearly matter for that purpo&s;e. The fi&s;h, in which the pearls are found, is much larger than the common oy&s;ter, and is called concha mar|garitifera. It abounds on the coa&s;t of Per&s;ia, near Ormus, about Cape Cormorin, and on the coa&s;t of the i&s;land of Ceylon. The oriental pearls are mo&s;t valued on account of their largene&s;s, colour and beau|ty; but pearls are caught in the &s;eas of the Ea&s;t-In|dies, in tho&s;e of America, and in &s;ome parts of Eu|rope. At the commencement of the &s;ea&s;on, which
<PB N="65" REF="036664_0064_100A5FC91E883150">
is in March and April, and again in Augu&s;t and September, there appear frequently two hundred and fifty barks on the banks; in the larger are two di|vers; in the &s;maller, one. Each bark puts off from &s;hore before &s;un-ri&s;e, by a land-breeze which never &s;ails, and returns again by a &s;ea-breeze, which &s;uc|ceeds it at noon. As &s;oon as the barks have arrived at the place where the fi&s;h lie, and have ca&s;t anchor, each diver binds a &s;tone under his body, which is to &s;erve him as balla&s;t, and prevent his being driven away by the motion of the writer, and al&s;o to enable him to walk more &s;teadily among the waves. Be|&s;ides this, they tie another heavy &s;tone to one foot, in order to &s;ink them to the bottom of the &s;ea: and as the oy&s;ters adhere &s;trongly to the rocks, they arm their fingers with leather gloves, or take an iron rake to di&s;place them with. La&s;tly, each diver carries with him a large net, tied to his neck by a long cord, the other end of which is fa&s;tened to the &s;ide of the bark. The net or &s;ack is intended to hold the oy&s;ters he may collect, and the cord is to pull him up by, when his bag is full, or when he wants air. Thus equipped, he precipitates him&s;elf, &s;ometimes above &s;ixty feet under water. As he has no time to lo&s;e, as &s;oon as he arrives at the bottom, he begins to tear the oy&s;ters off the rocks, and cram them into his budget. At whatever depth the divers are, the light is &s;ufficient for them to &s;ee what pa&s;&s;es around them, and &s;ometimes, to their great con&s;ternation, they be|hold mon&s;trous fi&s;hes, from who&s;e jaws they can e&s;cape only by mudding the water, and concealing them&s;elves by that means; although this artifice will not always &s;ave them from falling a prey to the&s;e formidable enemies. The be&s;t divers will remain under water near half an hour, during which time they hold their breath, without the u&s;e of oils, ac|quiring the habit by long practice; but the exertion is &s;o violent, as generally to &s;horten the lives of tho&s;e who repeat it frequently.

<P>The poor men, who encounter the&s;e dangers for a livelihood, do not con&s;ider how trifling the value of the pearls is in it&s;elf, but what great advantages they can gain by the ri&s;k. Single pearls have been &s;old for immen&s;e &s;ums of money. Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt, wore one as an ear-ring, that Pliny has e&s;timated at eighty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling.

<P>The workman, who blows the gla&s;s, takes his blowing iron, which is a hollow tube about two feet and a half long, and dipping it in the melt|ing-pot, turns it about: the metal &s;ticks to the iron like honey: he dips four times for every gla&s;s, and at every dip, rolls the end of his in&s;trument, with the gla&s;s on it, on a piece of iron, over which is a ve&s;&s;el of water, which by its coolne&s;s con&s;olidates the gla&s;s, and di&s;po&s;es it to bind better with the next to be taken out of the pot. When he has got enough of matter on the in&s;trument, he begins to blow gen|tly through it, in the &s;ame manner as boys blow &s;oap-&s;uds through a pipe, and in order to give it a poli&s;h, he rolls it backwards and forwards on a &s;tone or marble: after blowing, and whirling the iron till he has formed the gla&s;s to the intended &s;hape, he delivers it to the ma&s;ter workman to break off the collet, which is a little piece that &s;ticks to the iron. In order to hollow it out, another workman thru&s;ts in an iron in&s;trument, and turns it round with a cir|cular motion till it is &s;ufficiently enlarged. When it is perfectly formed, it is &s;et in the lear or third furnace to anneal or harden; it is proper to add, that the &s;tem, and the foot of a drinking gla&s;s, re|quire each a di&s;tinct operation.</P>

<P>There are two methods of mak|ing plates for looking-gla&s;&s;es; the one, by blowing them much in the &s;ame manner as they blow gla&s;s for windows, but on a larger &s;cale. The other, ca&s;t|ing or running of them, which is generally practi&s;ed in making large gla&s;&s;es. The French claim the hon|our of this invention. It was fir&s;t propo&s;ed to the French court in 1688, by the Sieur Abraham The|vart. It is performed in nearly a &s;imilar manner to the ca&s;ting of &s;heet-lead, and this method not only enables them to make gla&s;&s;es of more than double the &s;ize of any made by blowing, but al&s;o to ca&s;t all
<PB N="70" REF="036664_0069_100A5FD4CDD70B88">
kinds of borders, mouldings, &amp;c. The furnaces for melting the materials of this manufacture are of en|ormous &s;ize, and tho&s;e for annealing the gla&s;&s;es, when formed, &s;till larger. There are at lea&s;t twenty-four annealing furnaces or ovens, each above twenty feet long, placed around a melting furnace. All the&s;e furnaces are covered over with a large &s;hed, under which are likewi&s;e built forges and workhou&s;es for &s;miths, carpenters, and other artificers, who are con|tinually employed in repairing and keeping in order the machines, furnaces, &amp;c. as al&s;o apartments for the&s;e, and the workmen employed about the gla&s;s. So that the gla&s;s-hou&s;e in the ca&s;tle of St. Gobin, in the fore&s;t of Fere, in the Sci&s;&s;onois, celebrated for its excellence in this manufacture, appears more like a little city, than an a&s;&s;emblage of workmen's &s;heds. The in&s;ides of the furnaces are lined with a &s;ort of baked earth, adapted to &s;u&s;tain the action of fire, and the &s;ame earth &s;erves al&s;o for melting-pots, ci&s;terns, &amp;c. The ci&s;terns are about a yard long, and half as wide, they &s;erve for the conveyance of liquid gla&s;s, which is drawn out of the melting-pots, to the ca&s;t|ing tables. When the matter is &s;ufficiently vitrified, refined, and &s;ettled, they fill the ci&s;terns, and leave them in the furnace, till they appear white through exce&s;&s;ive heat. The table on which the gla&s;s is to be run, is of ca&s;t iron. There is a curious machinery to remove the ci&s;terns from the furnaces to the table, which places them in an inclined po&s;ition, &s;o as to di&s;charge a torrent of matter, like liquid fire, with which the table is pre&s;ently covered. As &s;oon as the gla&s;s is come to a con&s;i&s;tence, they &s;hove it off into the annealing furnace, with an iron raker as wide as the table, being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by workmen on the other &s;ide of the furnace, who pull it to them with iron hooks.</P>

<P>The &s;urpri&s;ing dexterity and
<PB N="71" REF="036664_0070_100A5FD6E8A72290">
quickne&s;s with which they perform the different op|erations, is inconceivable to tho&s;e who have not been eye-witne&s;&s;es of that wonderful manufacture. The ti&s;ors, or per&s;ons employed in heating the large fur|naces, run round the furnace in their &s;hirts, without the lea&s;t intermi&s;&s;ion, with a &s;peed &s;carcely inferior to that of the lighte&s;t courier: as they go along, they take two billets of wood, and throw them into the fir&s;t furnace, and continuing their cour&s;e, do the &s;ame for the &s;econd. This they hold on uninterrupt+edly for &s;ix hours together. One would not expect, that two &s;uch &s;mall pieces of wood, which are con|&s;umed in an in&s;tant, would maintain the furnace in the proper degree of heat, which is &s;o great, that a large bar of iron, laid at one of the mouths of the furnace, becomes red hot in le&s;s than half a minute. The proce&s;s of the&s;e gla&s;&s;es is now completed, except grinding, poli&s;hing, and foliating, or laying on of the quick&s;ilver. The grinding of gla&s;s requires great nicety, when performed on gla&s;&s;es that are de&s;igned for tele&s;copes, or other optical u&s;es. Plate or ca&s;t gla&s;s is ground by placing it on a &s;tone table, in &s;uch a manner, that it cannot be &s;haken or di&s;placed, and then by means of a wooden frame, another gla&s;s is rubbed backwards and forwards over it, with water and &s;and between them, and thus by con&s;tant attri|tion their &s;urfaces become &s;mooth.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Horn and oiled paper were the &s;ub&s;titutes they were obliged to u&s;e. Gla&s;s windows were not known in England till 1180; and then were con&s;idered as a mark of great magnificence, &s;uitable only to palaces, churches, &amp;c. The Italians po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this art fir&s;t. The French learned it of them, and from thence it was brought into England. Venice for many years excelled all Europe in the finene&s;s of its gla&s;&s;es: and in the thirteenth century, were the only people that had the &s;ecret of making cry&s;tal looking-gla&s;&s;es. The gla&s;s manufacture was fir&s;t begun in England in 1557. Gla&s;s plates were made at Lambeth, in 1673, under the patronage of the Duke of Buckingham, who introduced this man|ufacture into England, with amazing &s;ucce&s;s. So that in a century we have attained the art in a de|gree, that rivals even the Venetians, and are no long|er obliged to be &s;upplied with this article from for|eign countries.</P>

The an|cient manner of painting on gla&s;s was very &s;imple, and con&s;i&s;ted in the mere arrangement of pieces of gla&s;s of different colours, in &s;ome &s;ort of &s;ymmetry, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd con&s;tituted a &s;pecies of what we call mo&s;aic work. In time, the ta&s;te for this kind of work im|proved, and the art being found applicable to the adorning of churches and other public buildings, they found means of incorporating the colours with the gla&s;s it&s;elf, by expo&s;ing them to a proper degree of fire, after the colours are laid on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is an ea&s;y method of paint|ing &s;mall pictures on gla&s;s, called back-painting, which requires but little &s;kill, and produces a pretty effect. You mu&s;t take a piece of crown gla&s;s, the &s;ize of the print you intend to paint, a mezzotinto is the be&s;t adapted to the purpo&s;e; &s;oak your print in clean water for forty-eight hours, if it be on very &s;trong, clo&s;e, hard gummed paper; but if on a &s;oft &s;pongy paper, two hours will be &s;ufficient; then lay the print between four &s;heets of paper, two beneath it, and two above it, that the moi&s;ture may be drawn out of it. In the mean while, let the gla&s;s be warm|ed at the fire, then with a hog's-hair bru&s;h dipped in melted Stra&s;burg turpentine, &s;mear the gla&s;s &s;moothly and evenly. Lay the print upon the gla&s;s, rubbing it gently from one end to the other, that it may lie clo&s;e. With the finger rub off the paper from the back&s;ide of the print, till nothing can be &s;een, but the print, like a thin film upon the gla&s;s, and &s;et it a&s;ide to dry. When it is well dried, var|ni&s;h it over with &s;ome white tran&s;parent varni&s;h, that the print may be &s;een through it, which is now fit for painting. Having prepared a variety of oil col|ours,
<PB N="75" REF="036664_0074_100A5FE010B42B38">
which mu&s;t be ground very fine, and tempered very &s;tiff, lay &s;uch colours on the tran&s;parent print as your fancy and ta&s;te direct; the outlines of the print guiding the pencil&punc; and it will produce a very pretty effect. You mu&s;t be careful to lay on the col|ours thick enough to appear plainly through the gla&s;s. When your grotto is fini&s;hed, you may ex|erci&s;e your&s;elves this way, and each one produce a picture, though much inferior to tho&s;e works that re|quire the hand of an arti&s;t, yet affording amu&s;ement for a lei&s;ure hour, and varying the cour&s;e of your occupations.

<P>Chemically con&s;idered, he is in the right. Sugar is a &s;weet, agreeable, &s;aline juice, ex|pre&s;&s;ed from many different kinds of vegetables. Carrots, par&s;nips, white and red beets yield &s;ugar, but the plant, from which the &s;ugar, that is generally u&s;ed, is procured, is the &s;ugar-cane; a &s;ort of reed that grows in great plenty, in both the Ea&s;t and We&s;t-Indies.

<P>It is a genus of the triandria digynia cla&s;s. Its characters are, that it has no empalement; but in&s;tead of it, a woolly down longer than the flower that inclo&s;es it. The flower is bivalve, the valves are oblong, acute pointed, concave, and chaf|fy. It has three hairs like &s;tamina, the ends of the valves terminated by oblong &s;ummits; and an awl-&s;haped germen, &s;upporting two rough &s;tyles, crown|ed by &s;ingle &s;tigmas, the germen becomes an oblong,

they are put on board the &s;hips, they are crouded together in the hold, where many of them mo&s;tly die from want of air and room. There have been frequent in&s;tances of their throwing them&s;elves into the &s;ea, when they could find an opportunity, and &s;eeking a refuge from their misfortunes in death. As &s;oon as they arrive in the We&s;t-Indies, they are carried to a public market, where they are &s;old to the be&s;t bidder, like hor&s;es at our fairs. Their fu|ture lot depends much upon the di&s;po&s;ition of the ma&s;ter, into who&s;e ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> they happen to fall, for among the over&s;eers of &s;ugar-plantations there are &s;ome men of feeling and humanity; but too gener|ally their treatment is very &s;evere. Accu&s;tomed to an inactive indolent life, in the luxurious and plenti|ful country of Africa, they find great hard&s;hip from the tran&s;ition, to a life of &s;evere labour, without any mixture of indulgence to &s;often it. Deprived of hope of amending their condition, by any cour&s;e of conduct they can pur&s;ue, they frequently abandon them&s;elves to de&s;pair, and die, in what is called the &s;ea&s;oning, which is becoming inured by length of time to their &s;ituation. Tho&s;e who have le&s;s &s;en&s;i|bility and &s;tronger con&s;titutions, &s;urvive their com|plicated mi&s;ery but a few years: for it is generally acknowledged that they &s;eldom attain the full period of human life.</P>

<P>It is time to proceed in our ac|count of the proce&s;s of preparing the juice of the &s;u|gar-cane for u&s;e. When the canes are ripe, they are cut, and carried in bundles to the mill. The mills

con&s;i&s;t of three wooden rollers, covered with &s;teel-plates, and are &s;et in motion, either by water, wind, cattle, or even the hands of &s;laves. The juice being &s;queezed out of the canes, by the rollers, runs through a little canal into the &s;ugar-hou&s;e, where it falls into a ve&s;&s;el, from whence it is conveyed into the fir&s;t copper. With the liquor is mixed a quantity of a&s;hes and quick-lime, which &s;erves to purify it, by rai&s;ing up the unctuous matter in form of a &s;cum to the top, which is &s;kimmed off and given to poultry. This operation is performed five or &s;ix times, till the &s;ugar is &s;ufficiently purified, and become of a proper thickne&s;s to be converted into the various kinds for u&s;e. It is then put into hog&s;heads, and &s;ent over to England to the care of the &s;ugar-refiners, who&s;e bu|&s;ine&s;s it is to complete the proce&s;s, by boiling it up with bullocks blood, in order to clear it. Sometimes whites of eggs are u&s;ed for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. They add a little of the fine&s;t indigo to give it a good col|our. It is boiled over again, that the moi&s;t parts may evaporate. The next thing to be done is to fill the moulds, which are in the form of inverted cones. The rooms in which the&s;e moulds are placed are heated to a &s;uitable degree, to dry the &s;ugar they contain. When the loaves are fully dried, they are papered, and &s;old to the grocer.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>The material is the &s;ame, al|though the preparation varies. Sugar-candy is &s;ugar cry&s;tallized. It is fir&s;t di&s;&s;olved in a weak lime-wa|ter, then clarified, &s;cummed, &s;trained through a cloth, and boiled. It is afterwards put into forms or moulds, that are cro&s;&s;ed with threads to retain the &s;ugar as it cry&s;tallizes. The&s;e forms are &s;u&s;pended in a hot &s;tove, which is &s;hut up, and the fire made very vehement. Upon this, the &s;ugar fa&s;tens to the &s;trings that cro&s;s the forms, and there hangs in little &s;plinters of cry&s;tal. When the &s;ugar is quite dry,
<PB N="82" REF="036664_0081_100A5FEA73AB5B20">
the forms are broken, and the &s;ugar is taken out candied. Red &s;ugar-candy is coloured, by pouring a little juice of the Indian fig into the ve&s;&s;el, whil&s;t the &s;ugar is boiling. Barley-&s;ugar, is &s;ugar boiled till it is brittle, and then poured on a &s;tone anointed with oil of &s;weet almonds, and formed into twi&s;ted &s;ticks. It &s;hould be boiled up with a decoction of barley, whence it takes its name; they &s;ometimes ca&s;t &s;affron into it, to give to it the bright amber colour.</P>

<P>It is &s;ometimes di&s;tilled from rice and &s;ugar, fermented with the juice of cocoa-nuts; but it is generally di&s;tilled from a vegetable juice called toddy, which flows by inci&s;ion, out of the co|coa-nut tree, like the birch juice procured among us for wine. The &s;ugar-hou&s;e of a refiner is a large building, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix or &s;even floors, and the uten&s;ils nece&s;&s;ary to perform the different operations, require the aid of various kinds of workmen. The pans, coolers, ci&s;terns, &s;yrup-pipes, ba&s;ons, ladles, &s;kimmers, and &s;ometimes the candy-pots are made of copper. Pipes, pumps, and ci&s;terns made of lead
<PB N="83" REF="036664_0082_100A5FEBFA6737B8">
are al&s;o u&s;ed. The iron founder &s;upplies bars of a triangular form to be laid under the pans; al&s;o the cockel, which is an iron trunk u&s;ed to dry the goods in the &s;tove, iron doors, &amp;c. The carpenter is re|quired to furni&s;h racks, troughs, &s;tools, blocks, cool|ers, oars, &amp;c.

<P>The acer &s;accharinum, or the &s;ugar-maple-tree, grows in great quantities in the we&s;tern countries of all the middle &s;tates of the American U|nion. The&s;e trees are generally found mixed with the beech, hemlock, white and water-a&s;h, the cu|cumber-tree, linden, a&s;pen, butter-nut, and wild cherry-trees. They grow only on the riche&s;t foils, and frequently in &s;tony ground. Springs of the pure&s;t water abound in their neighbourhood. They are, when fully grown, as tall as the white and black oaks, and from two to three feet in diameter. They put forth a beautiful white blo&s;&s;om in the &s;pring be|fore they &s;hew a &s;ingle leaf. The wood of the maple-tree is extremely inflammable. Its &s;mall branches are &s;o much impregnated with &s;ugar, as to afford &s;upport to the cattle, hor&s;es, and &s;heep of the fir&s;t
<PB N="84" REF="036664_0083_100A5FEE61295D58">
&s;ettlers, during the winter, before they are able to cultivate forage for that purpo&s;e. Its a&s;hes afford a great quantity of pot-a&s;h, exceeded by a few of the trees that grow in the woods of the United States. The tree is &s;uppo&s;ed to arrive at its full growth in twenty years. It is not injured by tapping; on the contrary, the oftener it is tapped, the more &s;yrup it yields. The effects of a yearly di&s;charge of &s;ap from the tree, in improving and increa&s;ing the &s;ap, are demon&s;trated from the &s;uperior excellence of tho&s;e trees, which have been perforated in an hun|dred places, by a &s;mall wood-pecker, which feeds upon the &s;ap. The method of obtaining the &s;ap, is by boring a hole in the tree, with an auger; a &s;pout is introduced about half an inch into the hole, made by the auger. The &s;ap flows from four to &s;ix weeks, according to the temperature of the weather. Troughs are placed tinder the &s;pout to receive the &s;ap, which is carried every day to a large receiver, whence it is conveyed, after being &s;trained, to the boiler. There are three modes of reducing the &s;ap to &s;ugar; by evaporation, by freezing, and by boiling, of which the latter is mo&s;t expeditious. The profit of this tree is not confined to its &s;ugar. It affords a mo&s;t agreeable mola&s;&s;es, and an excellent vinegar. The &s;ap, which is &s;uitable for the&s;e purpo&s;es, is obtained, after the &s;ap which affords the &s;ugar has cea&s;ed to flow, &s;o that the manufactories of the&s;e different pro|ducts of the maple-tree, by &s;ucceeding, do not in|terfere with each other. The mola&s;&s;es may be u&s;ed to compo&s;e the ba&s;is of a plea&s;ant &s;ummer beer. The &s;ap of the maple is moreover capable of affording a &s;pirit. A tree &s;o various in its u&s;es, if duly culti|vated, may one day &s;upply us with &s;ugar; and &s;ilence the arguments of the planters, for a continu|ance of the &s;lave trade.</P>

<P>Sheep, according to Linnaeus, are of the order of pecora, and make a di&s;tinct genus, the char|acters which di&s;tingui&s;h them, are that their horns are hollow, bent backward, wreathed, crocked, and &s;cabrous. They have eight cutting teeth in the low|er jaw, but none in the upper, and no canine teeth. The wool of the&s;e animals con&s;i&s;ts only of long &s;len|der hairs, much twi&s;ted, and variou&s;ly interwoven with one another. This cloathing is peculiar to the &s;heep kind, &s;o far as is yet known, no other animal having been di&s;covered with a &s;imilar covering; neither is it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by all the &s;pecies of &s;heep, &s;ome of tho&s;e of the di&s;tant nations have &s;hort hair like that of the goat.</P>

<P>In addition to your general ac|count of the &s;heep, I will enumerate the &s;pecies, and their peculiarities, which according to the &s;ame great ma&s;ter of natural arrangement, Linnaeus, are three; fir&s;t the ovis aris, or ram &s;heep, which com|prehends many varieties, &s;uch as the common &s;heep, with large horns twi&s;ting &s;pirally and outwardly: the hornle&s;s &s;heep, with the tail hanging down to the
<PB N="88" REF="036664_0087_100A5FF828B98598">
knees; this kind is common in many parts of Eng|land. The Spani&s;h, or many horned &s;heep, having u&s;ually three horns, and &s;ometimes four or five. This &s;ort of &s;heep is frequent in Iceland, Siberia, and other northern countries. The African &s;heep, which has &s;hort hair like that of the goat; and the broad-tailed &s;heep, which is common in Syria, Bar|bary, and Ethiopia. The tails of the&s;e are &s;o long, as to trail upon the ground, and the &s;hepherds are obliged to put boards with &s;mall wheels under them, to keep them from galling. The&s;e tails are e&s;teem|ed a great delicacy, being of a &s;ub&s;tance between fat and marrow; they &s;ometimes weigh fifty pounds each. The broad-tailed &s;heep are al&s;o found in the kingdom of Thibet, and their fleeces are equal to tho&s;e of Caramania in finene&s;s, beauty, and length. The Cackemirians engro&s;s this article, and have fac|tors in all parts of Thibet, for buying up the wool, which they work up into tho&s;e elegant &s;hawls, that are brought into this country from the Ea&s;t-Indies, and this manufacture &s;upplies them with a con&s;ider|able &s;ource of wealth. The &s;econd &s;pecies is the ovis Guinien&s;is, commonly called the Angola &s;heep. They are long legged and tall, and their ears hang down, the horns are &s;mall and bending down to the eyes. The neck is adorned with a long mane, the hair of the re&s;t of the body is &s;hort, and it has wat|tles on the neck. The third &s;pecies is the ovis &s;trep|&s;iciros, or Cretan &s;heep, with horns quite erect, twi&s;t|ed like a &s;crew, and beautifully furrowed on the out|&s;ide. This kind is common in Hungary, and large flocks of them are found on Mount Ida, in Crete. The manners of this animal are naturally harmle&s;s and timid; it threatens by &s;tamping with its foot, but its only re&s;i&s;tance is by butting with its horns. It generally brings one young one at a time, &s;ome|times two, and rarely three. It is a valuable animal to the farmer, as it is kept at the lea&s;t expence of any, and will thrive upon almo&s;t any pa&s;ture ground, not particularly wet; a con&s;tant damp cau&s;es them to rot.</P>

Fif|ty-four brave The&s;&s;alians accompanied him in his expedition, and from the name of the ve&s;&s;el are cal|led Argonants. Their object is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a profitable trade in wool, in which that country excelled. The difficulties he met with in his undertaking, and which he overcame by his prudence, are repre&s;ented by the fable of a dragon, that guarded the fleece, and which he is &s;aid to have killed by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Medea, an enchant|re&s;s.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Various are the operations it un|dergoes before it is in a proper &s;tate for the purpo&s;es you mention. The fleeces, when taken out of the bales in which they are packed, after &s;hearing, mu&s;t be &s;coured; when the wool has continued long e|nough in the liquor to di&s;&s;olve and loo&s;en the grea&s;e, it is taken out, and well wa&s;hed and dried; it is then beat with rods, on hurdles of wood, to clear it of the du&s;t and gro&s;&s;er filth. The next thing is to pick it, and oil it with oil of olives. It is now given out to the &s;pinners, who fir&s;t card it on the knee; that is, pa&s;s it between the points or teeth of two in&s;truments &s;omething like a curry-comb, called cards, to di&s;|entangle it, and prepare it for &s;pinning, which is an operation too common to need de&s;cription. The thread or wor&s;ted being &s;pun, reeled, and made into &s;keins, is ready for the hand of the weaver, who begins his work by putting the warp, or threads, the long way of the piece, into the loom, which he &s;tiffens with &s;ize before he forms the woof, which is done by throwing the thread with a &s;huttle acro&s;s the warp, till the work be fini&s;hed; when it is to be cleared of all knots, &amp;c. and carried to the fuller to be &s;coured and clean&s;ed, ready for dying; af|ter it is dyed, it is pre&s;&s;ed and prepared for &s;ale.

Wool is the &s;taple commodity of this i&s;l|and, and forms the principal article in our foreign and dome&s;tic trade. The yearly produce of wool in England, towards the clo&s;e of the la&s;t century, was calculated at two millions &s;terling, and con&s;equent|ly it gives employment to a va&s;t number of hands. A pack, or two hundred and forty pounds weight of &s;hort wool, is computed to employ &s;ixty-three per|&s;ons a week, to manufacture it into cloths: and when it is made into &s;tuffs or &s;tockings, it employs a much greater number.</P>

<P>It may be &s;aid to to have ri&s;en into notice about the fourteenth century. King Ed|ward the third introduced the fine woolen manufac|ture from the Netherlands. Queen Elizabeth great|ly improved the &s;tate of this manufacture by her patronage, in which &s;he received con&s;iderable a&s;|&s;i&s;tance from the troubles in the Low Countries, ex|cited by the &s;everity of the Duke of Alva, and the Spani&s;h inqui&s;ition, on account of religion, which drove numbers of manufacturers to take &s;helter in England, where they enjoyed protection and en|couragement to &s;ettle. Contra&s;t the conduct of E|lizabeth and the Duke of Alva. The one cheri&s;hed the u&s;eful arts, and diffu&s;ed happine&s;s and wealth among her people; the other, from a gloomy &s;u|per&s;tition, deprived his country of u&s;eful manufact|urers,

<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>We cannot adopt a more &s;uitable &s;ubject; the one leads the way to the other. In the early &s;avage &s;tate, when men united in &s;mall &s;ocie|ties, for the &s;ake of protection and defence, we find they clothed them&s;elves with the &s;kins of bea&s;ts in their rough natural &s;tate, unimproved by any art or dre&s;&s;ing, merely for the purpo&s;es of decency and warmth. In cold climates, the &s;avage tribes fre|quently wear the hair inwards. As they advance to a higher &s;tate of civilization, they make u&s;e of ma|terials that admit of greater &s;kill in preparing, and &s;tudy ornament as well as u&s;e. Captain Cook re|lates, that the inhabitants of &s;ome places he vi&s;ited, have a method of weaving cloth of a certain &s;pecies of gra&s;s. The natives of Atooi make cloaks and caps of feathers, with great ingenuity, on which they &s;et a high value, and which appear appropria|ted to the chiefs, and great men of the country. Many of the i&s;lands in the South-Sea, are &s;o far ad|vanced towards civilized life, as to have an e&s;tabli&s;h|ed manufacture of cloth, which is made by the wo|men. They take the &s;talks or trunks of the paper-mulberry, which rarely grows more than &s;even feet in height, and about the thickne&s;s of four fingers. From the&s;e &s;talks they &s;trip the bark, and &s;crape off the exterior rind; after which the bark is rolled up, and &s;oftened for &s;ome time in water; it is then beat|en with a &s;quare in&s;trument of wood, full of coar&s;e grooves, but &s;ometimes with a plain one. When &s;uf|ficiently
<PB N="94" REF="036664_0093_100A60064FFBA4F0">
beaten, it is &s;pread out to dry; the piece be|ing from four to &s;ix or &s;even feet in length, and a|bout half as broad. The&s;e pieces are joined by &s;mearing part of them with the glutinous juice of a berry, called Tooo; and, after being thus lengthen|ed, they are placed over a large piece of wood, with a &s;ort of &s;tamp, compo&s;ed of a fibrous &s;ub&s;tance laid beneath them. The manufacturers then take a bit of cloth, and having dipped it in a juice expre&s;&s;ed from the bark of a tree, called kokka, rub it bri&s;kly over the piece that is making. This leaves a dry glo&s;s, and a dull brown colour upon the &s;urface, and the &s;tamp makes, at the &s;ame time, a &s;light impre&s;|&s;ion, which fini&s;hes the work. But when we com|pare the&s;e &s;imple works, with the variety, elegance, and utility of the manufactures of the poli&s;hed na|tions of Europe and A&s;ia, the degrees of refinement and civilization are clearly marked; and we are en|abled to form di&s;tinct ideas of the difference between the rude productions of the untutored mind, and tho&s;e which are the re&s;ult of &s;cience and art; but I am wandering from our &s;ubject. Sophia, your young friends wait impatiently to hear your account of flax and hemp, which form the materials of the linen of this country, from the coar&s;e&s;t cloth, to the fine&s;t lace.</P>

<P>Flax is a genus of the petandria, pentagy|nia cla&s;s.

<P>The time of &s;owing is the latter end of March. The be&s;t way of &s;owing flax-&s;eed is to drill it in equi-di&s;tant rows, about ten inches from one another.

<P>Riga &s;upplies us with the be&s;t &s;eed. Scotland and Ireland import great quantities from thence annually.

<P>Hemp is very &s;imilar to flax in its culture and u&s;e, therefore one de&s;cription of the manner of preparing them will be &s;ufficient for both. When they gather it, they pull it up by the roots, after which they bind it up in bundles. They comb out the heads on the teeth of a ripple, which pulls off the leaves, the hu&s;ks of the &s;eeds, and the &s;eeds them|&s;elves together. The&s;e are gathered in a heap, and left in that condition for a few days, in order to heat a little, after which they are &s;pread out to dry, be|fore they are thre&s;hed, and the &s;eeds are &s;eparated by winnowing and &s;ifting. Then, in order to rot the bark, they are laid in water, that it may be more ea|&s;ily &s;eparated from the reed. When it is &s;ufficiently rotted, the &s;talks are dried in an oven or kiln. The
<PB N="96" REF="036664_0095_100A60095B724E60">

<P>It is &s;aid that the fir&s;t &s;tep to knowledge, is a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of ignorance. En|deavour, children, to increa&s;e your &s;tock of u&s;eful knowledge daily, by attention to every thing you &s;ee and hear. There are various kinds of linen, the principal materials of which are flax, cotton, and hemp. The linen trade of Europe is chiefly in the hands of the Ru&s;&s;ians, Germans, Flemings, Holland|ers, French, and Iri&s;h. Cotton is a woolly or downy &s;ub&s;tance, which inclo&s;es the &s;eed, and is contained in a brown hu&s;k or &s;eed ve&s;&s;el of a certain plant that grows both in the Ea&s;t and We&s;t-Indies. There are &s;everal &s;pecies of this plant cultivated in different places. Cotton forms a very con&s;iderable article of commerce; it is di&s;tingui&s;hed into two &s;orts; cotton in the wool, and &s;pun cotton. The fir&s;t is quilted between two &s;tuffs, and is made u&s;e of for the pur|po&s;e of rendering them thick and warm, as for cov|erlids for beds, petticoats, &amp;c. but the latter kind is of mo&s;t general u&s;e, as when &s;pun and wove, it makes calicoes, cloths, mu&s;lins, dimities, be&s;ides a kind of quilting, ingeniou&s;ly contrived to re&s;emble

that done with a needle. It is al&s;o frequently inter|mixed with &s;ilk or flax, in the competition of vari|ous kinds of &s;tuffs. Manche&s;ter, which has long been celebrated for various branches of the linen, &s;ilk, and cotton manufacture, is now con&s;picuous as the centre of the cotton trade.</P>

<P>Although hemp does not form a material for works of &s;o delicate a texture as flax and cotton, it de&s;erves to be noticed for the many u&s;eful properties it contains.

<P>I am always ready to obey you. Hemp is a &s;pecies of the dioecia pentandria cla&s;s. It is male and female in different plants. The male flowers have a five-leaved concave empalement, with|out petals, but have five &s;hort hairy &s;tamina, termi|nated by oblong &s;quare &s;ummits. The female flow|ers have permanent empalements of one leaf, with|out petals, but a &s;mall germen, which afterwards be|comes a globular depre&s;&s;ed &s;eed, inclo&s;ed in the em|palement. We have but one &s;pecies of this plant, which is propagated in the rich fenny parts of Lin|coln&s;hire, in great quantities for its bark, which is u&s;eful for cordage, cloth, &amp;c.</P>

<P>You &s;hew a good memory. This oil has mo&s;t of the qualities of the nut-oil, and is u&s;ed as a &s;ub&s;titute for it in painting. The oil drawn without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of fire, is much e&s;teemed in medicine, e&s;pecially in the cure of catarrhs, coughs, a&s;thmas, &amp;c. After the oil is &s;queezed from the &s;eeds, the &s;eeds are heated over the fire, and being put into woollen bags, are pre&s;&s;ed into pieces about twelve inches long, and &s;ix inches wide, called oil|cakes, and u&s;ed to fatten cattle.

<P>There is a mineral &s;ub&s;tance, called a&s;|be&s;tos, of a whiti&s;h or &s;ilver colour, and a woolly texture, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;mall threads or fibres, endued with the wonderful property of re&s;i&s;ting fire, and re|maining uncon&s;umed in the inten&s;e&s;t heat. A meth|od has been found of working the&s;e fibres into cloth and paper. This kind of linen was much e&s;teemed by the ancients, being held equally precious with the riche&s;t pearls. Pliny &s;ays, he had &s;een napkins made of it, which, when taken &s;oiled from the table at a fea&s;t, were thrown into the fire, and were better &s;coured in that manner, than they could have been, if they had been wa&s;hed in water; but the purpo&s;e, for which it was &s;o highly valued, was the making of &s;hrouds for royal funerals, to wrap up the corp&s;e, &s;o that the a&s;hes of the decea&s;ed might be pre&s;erved di&s;tinct from tho&s;e of the wood, &amp;c. of which the fu|neral pile was compo&s;ed.

<P>Did not the ancients bury their dead in the &s;ame manner we do?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Different nations and ages have had various modes of di&s;po&s;ing of their decea&s;ed friends and relations. The ancient Romans carried the body, borne on a bed or litter, covered with pur|ple, and followed by the kindred of the decea&s;ed, to the ro&s;tra; and if he had been a per&s;on of great qual|ity, attended by old women, called praeficae, &s;inging &s;ongs in his prai&s;e; and the funeral was preceded by waxen images of all his predece&s;&s;ors borne on poles. When arrived there, the neare&s;t of kin pronounced an oration extolling his virtues and tho&s;e of his an|ce&s;tors;
<PB N="100" REF="036664_0099_100A601241EF54B0">
after which they proceeded to the funeral pile, whereupon they laid the body, and &s;et fire to the whole. The a&s;hes were then carefully gathered up, and inclo&s;ed in an urn, which was placed in the &s;epulchre or tomb. The ceremonies of the Egyp|tians were very peculiar. They embalmed the body with aromatic &s;pices and perfumes, in order to pre|&s;erve it from decay; and it is &s;uppo&s;ed that the pyramids, &s;o wonderful for their antiquity and mag|nitude, were erected as monuments or tombs to con|tain the bodies of their departed kings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>One of their cu&s;toms plea&s;es me much, as I think it was calculated to re&s;train vice, and encourage virtue. They brought their kings to a form of trial after their death: tho&s;e who were convicted of having oppre&s;&s;ed their people, and lead|ing bad lives, were deprived of the honours of buri|al, and their memories held in dete&s;tation; but very re&s;pect was paid to tho&s;e who had pa&s;&s;ed their lives in a virtuous manner; and even durable monu|ments erected to perpetuate their names, and tran&s;|mit the recollection of their example to the late&s;t po&s;|terity. To-morrow evening we &s;hall &s;elect the &s;ilk manufacture as a &s;ubject, well &s;uited to follow tho&s;e of wool and linen, and forming a proper &s;equel to them. At pre&s;ent I find my&s;elf a little indi&s;po&s;ed, and wi&s;h to retire early. Adieu, my dear children, ea&s;y dreams, and a good night to you.</P>

<P>Wool and flax are extremely valuable for their u&s;e, and are no more to be con|temned in comparing them with &s;ilk, than iron is to be undervalued in compari&s;on with gold and &s;ilver.

refu&s;ed the empre&s;s, his wife, a &s;uit of &s;ilk, which &s;he &s;olicited of him with much earne&s;tne&s;s, merely on account of its dearne&s;s.

<P>The Greeks of Alexander the Great's army, are &s;uppo&s;ed to have brought wrought &s;ilk fir&s;t from Per&s;ia, into Greece, about three hun|dred and twenty-three years before Chri&s;t. But the manufacture of it was confined to Phoenecia, from whence it was di&s;per&s;ed over the We&s;t. Two monks, coming from the Indies to Con&s;tantinople, in 555, under the patronage of the Emperor Ju&s;tinian, brought with them great quantities of &s;ilk-worms; with in&s;tructions for the hatching their eggs, rearing and feeding the worms, and &s;pirming and working the &s;ilk; which was the means of e&s;tabli&s;hing man|ufactures at Athens, Thebes, and Corinth. The Ve|netians, &s;oon after this time, commencing a com|merce with the Greek empire, &s;upplied all the we&s;t|ern parts of Europe with &s;ilks for many centuries. But various improvements have been made in the art &s;ince that time; &s;uch as dama&s;ks, velvets, &amp;c. The re&s;t of Italy and Spain, by degrees, learned this art, from &s;ome manufactories e&s;tabli&s;hed by Roger the Second, King of Sicily, about 1150, in different parts of his dominions. And a little before the reign of Francis the Fir&s;t, the French became ma&s;ters of it.</P>

<P>Silk remained a rarity a long time in France. Their king, Henry the Second, is &s;uppo&s;ed to have worn the fir&s;t pair of knit &s;ilk &s;tock|ings. After the civil-wars, the plantations of mul|berry-trees
<PB N="103" REF="036664_0102_100A601A191BEEC8">
were greatly encouraged by Henry the Fourth, &s;urnamed the Great, on account of the love he &s;hewed his people, and the true patrioti&s;m he di&s;|played during his trouble&s;ome reign. His &s;ucce&s;&s;ors continued to patroni&s;e the culture of the&s;e trees, and the produce of &s;ilk is at this day very con&s;iderable in that country. King James the Fir&s;t was very earne&s;t to introduce it into England, but unhappily without effect. Although we have hitherto failed in rearing the worms, and rai&s;ing raw &s;ilk of our own, the broad &s;ilk manufacture was introduced among us as early as the year 1620, and pur&s;ued with great vig|our and advantage.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Greatly were we indebted to the tyranny and intolerance of our neighbours, the French, who by the revocation of the edict of Nantes, in 1685, which means the repealing a law made in favour of Prote&s;tants drove va&s;t numbers of their mo&s;t &s;kilful workmen in this branch, to take &s;helter in our land of liberty; they were kindly received, and &s;ettled in Spital-Fields, where they have carried on an ingenious and flouri&s;hing manufacture, till within the&s;e few years, that the Briti&s;h ladies have exchanged the wear of &s;ilk, for that of callicoes and mu&s;lins, by which tran&s;ition the&s;e poor manufactu|rers are reduced to a very di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation; being without employment, and in want of mo&s;t of the nece&s;&s;aries of life. It is an object worthy the con|&s;ideration of per&s;ons of ability, to &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome plan for turning the indu&s;try of &s;o many hands into a dif|ferent channel, and rendering them capable of main|taining their families, and becoming again u&s;eful to &s;ociety. The &s;ilk-worm is an in&s;ect, not more re|markable for the precious matter it furni&s;hes, than for the many forms it a&s;&s;umes.

<P>From an egg, about the &s;ize of a pin's head, it becomes a &s;mall black worm, which daily increa&s;es, till it is as large as a common caterpillar;
<PB N="104" REF="036664_0103_100A601BB76A33F8">
during its worm &s;tate, it frequently changes its &s;kin, and becomes by degrees of a light a&s;h colour, in|clined to yellow, and almo&s;t tran&s;parent when about to &s;pin. Henry brings me fre&s;h mulberry leaves ev|ery morning to feed them with. When come to maturity, the &s;ilk-worm winds it&s;elf up in a &s;ilken bag or ca&s;e, about the &s;ize and &s;hape of a pigeon's egg; it forms this ball by moving its mouth back|wards and forwards, chu&s;ing &s;ome corner to begin its work in, and fa&s;tening its &s;ilk, with a kind of natural gum, to the &s;ides, till it has entirely inclo&s;ed it&s;elf; always working from one &s;ingle end, which it never breaks, unle&s;s di&s;turbed; and it is &s;o fine, and &s;o long, that I have read, that tho&s;e who have exam|ined it attentively, think they &s;peak within compa&s;s, when they affirm, that each ball contains &s;ilk enough to reach the length of &s;ix Engli&s;h miles. On open|ing this curious web, one is &s;urpri&s;ed to find a chry&s;|alis or aurelia, in&s;tead of a &s;ilk-worm, which is brown, and about the &s;ize of a bean. In this &s;tate it remains for &s;ome time apparently without life or motion; till at length out creeps a whiti&s;h moth, leaving the hu&s;k or outer &s;kin of the chry&s;alis behind it. This is the la&s;t form it a&s;&s;umes; for, after having laid a multitude of eggs, it dies, and leaves them to be hatched by the warmth of the &s;ucceeding &s;pring.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>When the worm is &s;uppo&s;ed to have fini&s;hed its work, which is generally in about ten days, the people who are employed in the care of the&s;e in&s;ects, for the &s;ake of profit, collect the gol|den balls from off the mulberry trees, to the leaves of which they glue their &s;ilk, and putting a handful of them into a copper of warm water, of a proper temperature to di&s;&s;olve the gum, and occa&s;ion the &s;ilk to wind off more readily, having fir&s;t pulled off a woolly coar&s;e kind of &s;ilk, which covers the balls. They take the ends of twelve or fourteen cones at a time, and wind them off into &s;keins. In order to prepare this beautiful material for the hand of the weaver, to be wrought into &s;ilks, &s;tuffs, brocades,

<P>The &s;ecret has been di&s;covered in France, within a few years, of procuring and pre|paring &s;ilk from &s;pider's webs, and the u&s;ing it in &s;everal manufactures has been attempted.

regard to the &s;ilk &s;piders, they are reduced to two kinds, tho&s;e with long legs, and tho&s;e with &s;hort, which la&s;t furni&s;h the fine&s;t raw &s;ilk. The &s;ilk it makes is nearly as beautiful, glo&s;&s;y, and &s;trong, as that of the &s;ilk-worm; the &s;ilk proceeds from five papilla or nipples, placed under the belly, towards the end of the tail. The&s;e &s;erve as &s;o many wire-drawing irons, to form and mould a vi&s;cous liquor, which, when dried in the air, as it is drawn through them, forms the &s;ilk. The threads are of two kinds; the fir&s;t is weak, and only &s;erves for that kind of web, with which they catch flies. The &s;econd is much &s;tronger, and is applied to wrap up their eggs in, which by means of this inclo&s;ure, are &s;heltered from the cold, and the depredations of other in&s;ects. They wind the&s;e threads very loo&s;ely round the eggs, re|&s;embling the balls or bags of &s;ilk-worms, that have been prepared and loo&s;ened for the di&s;taff. After having gathered twelve or thirteen ounces of the&s;e bags, M. Bon, the per&s;on who made the&s;e experi|ments, had them well beaten for &s;ome time, to get out all the du&s;t; he then wa&s;hed them in lukewarm water; after this he &s;teeped them in a large ve&s;&s;el, with &s;oap, &s;alt-petre, and gum arabic; when he boiled the whole, for three hours, over a gentle fire; the &s;oap was then wa&s;hed out of them, and the bags dri|ed, to fit them for carding. Stockings and gloves were made of it, and pre&s;ented to the Academy in Paris, as well as to our Royal Society in London. The great difficulty that remains to be &s;urmounted, is the art of breeding and confining the&s;e voracious in&s;ects in a room together, as the natural fiercene&s;s of &s;piders renders them incapable of living in com|munity. Four or five thou&s;and, being di&s;tributed into cells, the large ones &s;oon killed and devoured the &s;maller, &s;o that, in a &s;hort time, there was le&s;t &s;carcely more than one or two in a cell; and to this apparent unnatural propen&s;ity of eating one another, the &s;carcity of &s;piders is attributed, con&s;idering the va&s;t number of eggs they lay. Every &s;pider lays &s;ix

or &s;even hundred. The young ones live ten of twelve months without eating, and continue in their bags without growing, till the warmth of the returning &s;ummer, putting their vi&s;cid juices in motion, induces them to come forth, &s;pin, and run about in &s;earch of food. But I believe Sophia is better qualified to give us a lecture on the con&s;truction and manners of this extraordinary little creature.</P>

<P>With peculiar plea&s;ure I &s;hall relate what particulars I am acquainted with, as I am con|vinced, no one, who has examined its parts with a micro&s;cope, can behold it again as an object of ab|horrence. Spider, a genus of the aptera order of in|&s;ects; Linnaeus enumerates forty-&s;even &s;pecies. This in&s;ect affords, to the &s;agacious ob&s;erver, a great ma|ny curious particulars. As the fly (which is the &s;pider's natural prey) is an animal extremely cau|tious and nimble, and u&s;ually comes from above, it was nece&s;&s;ary the &s;pider &s;hould be furni&s;hed with a quick &s;ight, and an ability of looking upwards, for|wards, and &s;ideways at the &s;ame time; and the mi|cro&s;cope &s;hews that the number, &s;tructure, and di&s;|po&s;ition of its eyes are wonderfully adapted to the &s;erving all the&s;e purpo&s;es. Mo&s;t &s;piders have eight eyes, two on the top of the head or body; for there is no divi&s;ion between them, the &s;pider having no neck. The&s;e look directly upwards. There are two more in front, placed a little below the&s;e, and di&s;cov|ering all that pa&s;&s;es forwards; and on each &s;ide, a couple more, one of which points &s;ideways forwards, the other &s;ideways backwards, &s;o that it can &s;ee al|mo&s;t quite round. Whatever be the number of the &s;pider's eyes, for there are not the &s;ame number in all the different &s;pecies, they are, however, always im|moveable and tran&s;parent, and are &s;ituated in a mo&s;t curious manner. All &s;piders have eight legs, which they employ in walking, and two &s;horter ones, call|ed arms, u&s;ed in &s;eizing their prey. All the legs are thickly be&s;et with hairs, each has &s;ix joints, and ends with two hooked claws, which are jagged on
<PB N="108" REF="036664_0107_100A6024B24AC568">
the in&s;ide. By means of this &s;ort of teeth in the claws, they &s;eize very fa&s;t hold of their prey; be&s;ides the&s;e weapons of attack, nature has furni&s;hed this creature with a pair of &s;harp crooked claws, or for|ceps, in the fore part of its head. The&s;e are placed horizontally or cro&s;swi&s;e, and when not exerted for u&s;e, are concealed in two ca&s;es, contrived for their reception, in which they &s;old like a cla&s;p knife, and there lie between two rows of teeth, which are like|wi&s;e employed to hold fa&s;t the prey, &s;o that a poor fly has not the lea&s;t chance of e&s;caping the jaws of &s;uch a well-armed formidable enemy.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are welcome to the u&s;e of it, provided you are careful not to break it. Mr. Lewenhoek, who has made micro&s;copic objects his peculiar &s;tudy, has computed, that one hundred of the &s;ingle threads of a full-grown &s;pider, are not equal to the diameter of the hair of his beard; and con&s;equently, if the threads and hair be both round, ten thou&s;and &s;uch threads are not bigger than &s;uch a hair. He calculates that when young &s;piders fir&s;t begin to &s;pin, four hundred of their threads are not larger than one, which is of a full growth. Allow|ing this to be fairly &s;tated, four millions of a young &s;pider's threads are not &s;o big as the &s;ingle hair of a man's beard.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Charles has made &s;o good a choice, that you cannot be more agreeably amu&s;ed, than by attending to what he has collected on this &s;ubject. The beauty and utility of fore&s;t trees are &s;o obvious and &s;triking, that the mo&s;t carele&s;s eye mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of them. Charles, begin by telling us which are the principal trees u&s;ed for timber.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oak, elm, a&s;h, beech, poplar, walnut, che&s;nut, fir, and &s;ervice tree; but they all yield to the oak, as well in beauty of foliage, as in the utili|ty and duration of its timber. This noble tree forms our navies and cities; and, &s;hould the cultivation of it be neglected, we may vainly deplore the lo&s;s of tho&s;e wooden walls, that have &s;o long been our pride and defence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HENRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not under&s;tand what you mean by that expre&s;&s;ion. I thought walls had always been built of brick or &s;tone.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>I a&s;k pardon for making u&s;e of a figu|rative term. The naval &s;trength of our i&s;land is fre|quently called its wooden walls, and con&s;equently depends very much upon the cultivation of the be&s;t &s;pecies of timber. Every part of the oak has its u&s;e; the body is &s;awed into planks, to build &s;hips and hou&s;es with; &s;hingles, pales, laths, cooper's work, and wain&s;cot, are made of oak; its wood is the mo&s;t excellent for all works that require &s;trength and du|ration. The bark is u&s;ed by the tanner and dyer, to
<PB N="111" REF="036664_0110_100A602A8C427550">
whom the very &s;aw-du&s;t is u&s;eful. The a&s;hes and lie are made u&s;e of for bucking of linen, and to clean&s;e and purify wine. The roots are &s;uitable to make handles for daggers, knives, &amp;c. Its fruit, the acorn, &s;upplies food for deer and hogs; and when brui&s;ed, all kinds of poultry will thrive on it. Man before the cultivation of corn, fed on acorns, and in times of &s;carcity, they may &s;till prove a valuable &s;ub&s;titute. Different parts of the oak are u&s;ed in medicine; they are all of an a&s;tringent, binding quality. The wood of this tree is the lea&s;t adapted to works that require to be glued together, as it will not ea&s;ily adhere, ei|ther with its own kind or any other wood.</P>

<P>Is not ink made of oak galls? What part of the tree are they?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, they are u&s;ed in making ink, as well as in the compo&s;ition of various medicines: neither the oak apples nor the galls are any parts of the tree; they are formed by in&s;ects, which de|po&s;it their eggs in the &s;tem or leaf. There are vari|ous kinds of galls, formed by different in&s;ects, the inhabitants of a great variety of trees and &s;hrubs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>The hi&s;tory of galls is &s;o curious, that I cannot re&s;i&s;t relating &s;ome particulars concern|ing them. Among the &s;maller in&s;ects, there are many which, either in the whole &s;tate of the worm, or during &s;ome of the changes they undergo, are of &s;o render and delicate a &s;tructure, that they cannot bear the contact of air; and others that are continu|ally expo&s;ed to the ravages of a number of de&s;troyers. Provident nature, in order to their pre&s;ervation, has allotted them the galls of trees and plants for an hab|itation; in&s;tinct directs them to make them for them|&s;elves; for they never find the&s;e excre&s;cences ready formed. Some of the&s;e in&s;ects are produced from eggs, laid by their parent animal on the &s;talks of leaves, and as &s;oon as they are hatched, make their way into the leaf or &s;talk, and find a &s;afe lodging in this rece&s;s, and &s;uitable food in its juices. Others are in&s;erted by the mother fly, even in the egg &s;tate,
<PB N="112" REF="036664_0111_100A602CD34FD900">
within the &s;ub&s;tance of the trees and branches. The parents of the&s;e are a peculiar race of flies, &s;upplied with an in&s;trument at the end of their tails adapted to this purpo&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECILIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>How wonderful is the order of nature! the formation of the &s;malle&s;t in&s;ect, did we but know the purpo&s;e of its different parts, would furni&s;h us with &s;ubject of admiration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>The galls produced by different in&s;ects have a very different internal &s;tructure; &s;ome of them have only one large cavity, in which a num|ber of the animals live in community, others have &s;everal &s;mall cavities, with communications between each; and others have different numbers of little cel|lules each &s;eparate; and finally, there are others in which there is only one cavity inhabited by one in|&s;ect. The inhabitants of the&s;e two la&s;t kinds live in perfect &s;olitude during the worm &s;tate, and can have no knowledge of any other living creature, till they have pa&s;&s;ed through the intermediate &s;tate of chry|&s;alis, and become winged animals, like tho&s;e to which they owed their origin, and are ready in their turn to lay their eggs, and provide for the &s;ecurity of their future offspring. The variations in the dif|ferent kinds of galls are not confined to their &s;truc|ture merely; each &s;pecies has its peculiarity. Some of them are &s;o hard, that they equal the hardne&s;s of the wood they grow upon; and when cut open, ap|pear compo&s;ed of films much more den&s;ely and clo&s;e|ly arranged than tho&s;e of the wood it&s;elf; others are &s;oft and &s;pungy, and re&s;emble &s;ome of the tender fruits in appearance. The fir&s;t kind are called gall-nuts, and the latter apple-galls, or berry-galls; ma|ny of them are beautifully coloured, and are very u&s;eful to the dyer, as well as the phy&s;ician. The kermes is the mo&s;t valuable of them all, and produ|ces a &s;carlet dye, which is more durable than brilliant; it would take up too much time to mention the vari|ous particulars of each &s;pecies.

<P>There are many varieties of this u&s;eful tree, the different parts of each are capable of being turned to &s;ome advantage. Cork is the bark of a &s;pecies of the holm oak. It grows in great abun|dance in Spain, Italy, France, &amp;c. Depriving this tree of its bark does not injure it, for if timely cure be not taken to &s;trip it off, it &s;plits and peels off of it&s;elf, being pu&s;hed up by another bark formed un|derneath. In order to prepare it for u&s;e, it is piled in heaps, in ponds or ditches, then flattened with weights, and dried. It is principally applied to purpo&s;es to which its peculiar quality of repelling moi&s;ture is adapted; &s;uch as &s;oles for &s;hoes, corks for bottles, and bungs for barrels. Wai&s;tcoats for &s;wimming have al&s;o been made of it; its exce&s;&s;ive lightne&s;s rendering it &s;uitable for the purpo&s;e, as well as its power of repelling the water.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>The bark, or exterior covering of trees is not only u&s;eful to man for various purpo|&s;es, but it is formed for the pre&s;ervation of the trees al&s;o; it defends them from external injury, and pre|&s;erves them from the cold, when it is too &s;evere for their tender bodies. The rea&s;on that evergreens re|tain their leaves during the rigours of winter, is, be|cau&s;e their barks are of a more oily quality than the bark of other trees. There are a great many kinds of barks in u&s;e in the &s;everal arts. They are con|&s;idered as powerful re&s;toratives and &s;trengtheners in medicine. The bark of the alder is u&s;ed in dying; that of a peculiar &s;pecies of birch is converted by the Indians into canoes, capable of holding twenty per|&s;ons. A kind of rope is made of the bark of willows and linden trees. The bark of the cocoa-tree forms the cordage of the Siame&s;e, and mo&s;t of the A&s;iatic and African nations. In the Ea&s;t-Indies they ma|nufacture the bark of a certain tree into a kind of &s;tuff or cloth; it is &s;pun and dre&s;&s;ed much after the manner of hemp: indeed flax and hemp, with all their toughne&s;s, are only the &s;ap-ve&s;&s;els, or ligneous films of the bark of tho&s;e plants. The Ea&s;t-Indian
<PB N="114" REF="036664_0113_100A603071D9DF10">
thread, produced from bark, is of a middle kind be|tween &s;ilk and common thread; they &s;ometimes ma|nufacture it alone, at others mix it with &s;ilk, as in ginghams, &amp;c.</P>

<P>Good boy, for remembering what you have been told; the u&s;ual method of pre|paring it, is by boiling it a &s;ufficient time; the roots of hyacinths, a&s;phodel, narci&s;&s;us and the black bryo|ny, afford a tough &s;tringy juice, in great quantities of the &s;ame kind.</P>

<P>I hope my Henry remembers al&s;o, that when he was told what materials compo&s;|ed birdlime, he was taught to de&s;pi&s;e its u&s;e. It is mean and unmanly to deprive a poor bird of its lib|erty, merely to gratify our inclinations, without be|ing able to improve the condition of the little &s;uffer|er.

<P>I &s;hall next mention the elm, as &s;econd to the oak in &s;ize and beauty. It is particularly, a|dapted to bear extremes of wet and dry, and there|fore is frequently u&s;ed for water-works, mills, pipes, pumps, aqueducts, &amp;c. It is al&s;o &s;uited to the pur|po&s;es of the wheelwright. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ene&s;s of its grain renders it fit for works of ornament, &s;uch as foliages, &amp;c.

<P>If charcoal be made of wood, what pro|ce&s;s is u&s;ed to transform it to that &s;tate?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>They begin the operation by clearing a circular piece of ground, of turf and oth|er combu&s;tible matter. This &s;pace is filled with wood cut into pieces of about three feet in length, and laid in the form of a pile, with a &s;take driven into the centre; the whole is covered over moderately thick with turf and other rubbi&s;h; after &s;etting up a moveable &s;creen again&s;t the wind, the &s;take is pull|ed up, and the pile &s;et on fire, by pouring well-kindled coals into the cavity. The wood chars with|out being con&s;umed, by properly regulating the vent-holes, and keeping the ma&s;s covered. It is chiefly u&s;eful, where a clear &s;trong fire, without &s;moke, is required. Mathematical in&s;trument ma|kers, engravers, &amp;c. find charcoal very &s;erviceable in poli&s;hing bra&s;s or copper-plates, after they have rubbed them clean with powdered pumice-&s;tone. Charcoal and &s;oot-black &s;upply the painter and varn|i&s;her with the be&s;t and mo&s;t durable black. One of the principal ingredients in making gun-powder is charcoal; but I do not mention this as an in&s;tance of its utility; happy would it be for mankind, did peace and good will prevail among them &s;o power|fully, as to render &s;uch de&s;tructive inventions u&s;ele&s;s; but &s;ince this benign de&s;ire for univer&s;al harmony cannot be accompli&s;hed by the wi&s;hes of any one weak mortal, let each individual contribute his &s;hare

<P>The pine and fir trees are not valuable for their timber only, but turpentine, pitch, ro&s;in, and tar are made from them by the following &s;imple proce&s;s. In the &s;pring, when the &s;ap runs mo&s;t freely, they pare off the bark of the pine tree, and cut a hole at the bottom to receive the &s;ap;
<PB N="117" REF="036664_0116_100A603666607A68">
as it runs down, it leaves a white matter, rather thicker than cream, which is &s;ub&s;tituted in&s;tead of white wax, in the making of flambeaux. The liquor that runs into the hole at the bottom, is ladled into a large ba&s;ket; great part of this immediately runs through into &s;tone or earthen pots, prepared to re|ceive it, and forms the common turpentine. The thicker matter, which remains in the ba&s;ket, is di&s;till|ed with a large quantity of water, as long as any oil is &s;een &s;wimming upon the &s;urface of the water; which when &s;kimmed off, is common oil, or &s;pirit of turpentine. The matter, that &s;ettles at the bottom of the &s;till, is yellow ro&s;in. When they have obtain|ed all they can from the &s;ap of the tree, they cut it down, and hew the wood into billets, with which they fill a pit dug in the earth, and then &s;et them on fire; whil&s;t burning, there runs from them a black thick matter, which is tar; if they de&s;ire to make it into pitch, they boil it without adding any thing to it, and the work is completed.

The bark is u&s;ed for floats for fi&s;hing nets, in&s;tead of cork. It is very &s;ubject to the worm, which unfits it for purpo&s;es, where duration is requi&s;ite; but various parts of it are applied &s;uc|ce&s;sfully to lighter u&s;es. Band-boxes, &s;cabbards for &s;words, and hat-ca&s;es are made of the thin lamina, or &s;cale of this tree, and then covered with thin leath|er or paper.

<P>Of late years the drawing rooms of people of fa&s;hion have been furni&s;hed with tables curiou&s;ly inlaid with wood of various kinds, and the u&s;e of mahogany much laid a&s;ide.

<P>Woods and groves were held &s;a|cred through all antiquity. The Pagans generally built their temples in or near them, and the druids and bards, who were the mini&s;ters of religion among the ancient Britons, held them in the highe&s;t venera|tion. Particular trees were frequently con&s;ecrated among the heathens to &s;ome favourite divinity. The laurel was devoted to Apollo, who pre&s;ided over po|etry and the fine arts; hence victors in the Olympic games, &s;ucce&s;sful poets, and conquering heroes have been rewarded with crowns of laurel. The myrtle was the favourite tree of Venus, and the vine appro|priated to Bacchus. White poplar was u&s;ed in the &s;acrifices of Jupiter, and the pine on the altar of Ce|res. The Per&s;ian Magi burned their &s;acrifices with myrtle and boughs of laurel. The mythology of the Pagans extended the idea of the tutelary protection of woods and groves &s;o far, as to believe that they were generally inhabited by dryads, or wood nymphs.</P>

<P>As the number of inhabitants increa&s;ed, agriculture gradually improved; the great power of the barons being dimini&s;hed, the people at large became of more con&s;equence, and it was found nece&s;&s;ary to li&s;ten to their importunity, and convert &s;ome of the&s;e exten&s;ive royal fore&s;ts into &s;miling corn|fields, the harbingers of comfort and plenty. It will be happy if the pre&s;ent generation do not run into the oppo&s;ite extreme, and by neglecting the planting and pre&s;erving of timber, &s;ubject this country to the inconvenience and di&s;advantage of being &s;upplied from a foreign market. Indolence, the love of pre|&s;ent advantage, and want of attention to the good of po&s;terity, are ob&s;tacles to the improvement and prac|tice of this u&s;eful part of hu&s;bandry. Country gen|tlemen of fortune, who have lei&s;ure and money to advance, can hardly render their country a more ac|ceptable &s;ervice, than by rai&s;ing valuable plantations of the be&s;t kinds of timber for the u&s;e of &s;ucceeding generations. Their reward mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in the pat|rioti&s;m and benevolence of their intentions, and in the increa&s;ing value of their e&s;tates, as the period of the life of man gives no expectation of the planter enjoying the fruit of his own labour: an oak not ar|riving at perfection much &s;hort of a century.

Many a poor child has been di&s;gu&s;ted with books and learning, by the heavy laborious ta&s;ks that have been given him to learn by heart, before he was capable of under&s;tanding them. The &s;pirit of improvement, that di&s;tingui&s;hes this enlightened age, &s;hines in nothing more con&s;picuou&s;ly than in educa|tion.

<P>The au&s;tere manners of former times &s;ecluded children from the advantage of con|ver&s;ing with their parents or in&s;tructors; an unnat|ural di&s;tance was maintained between them; they were &s;eldom admitted into the parlour, but to pay a ceremonious vi&s;it.

The bodies for timber, the bark, leaves, blo&s;&s;oms, fruit, gums, re&s;in, manna, &s;ugar, contribute to our accommoda|tion, and are rendered, by art and ingenuity, &s;ub|&s;ervient to our u&s;e. Some trees afford food, others poi&s;on; the fibres of &s;ome &s;upply us with cloathing, the timber of many with habitations; from &s;ome we extract medicines for the u&s;e of our maladies; from others, dyes of various hues; &s;ome are adapted to form mu&s;ical in&s;truments, by the &s;onorous quality of their wood; &s;uch as maple, &s;ir, yew, and pear-tree: others, deficient in that property, compen&s;ate the de|fect, by excellence of a different kind.

<P>The fecundity of vegetables is equally amazing with that of fi&s;hes. Mr. Ray a&s;&s;erts that one thou&s;and and twelve &s;eeds of tobacco weigh|ed only one grain, and that from one tobacco plant, the &s;eeds thus calculated amounted to three hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and. The &s;eeds of the ferns are, by him, &s;uppo&s;ed to exceed a million on a leaf. This numerous reproduction prevents the accidental extinc|tion of the &s;pecies, at the &s;ame time that it &s;erves for food for the higher order of animation. Nature has provided in a wonderful manner both for the nouri&s;h|ment and pre&s;ervation of the immature &s;eed. Every &s;eed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a re&s;ervoir of nutriment, de&s;igned for the growth of the future plant; this con&s;i&s;ts of &s;tarch, mucilage, or oil within the coat of the &s;eed; or of

is entirely barren. Not a tree, or a &s;hrub, nor even the lea&s;t plant or gra&s;s is to be &s;een. The de&s;truc|tive effluvia that proceeds from the tree is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the cau&s;e of this &s;terile appearance. The poi&s;on which is procured from this tree, is a gum that i&s;&s;ues out between the bark and the tree it&s;elf, like the cam|phor. Malefactors, who are &s;entenced to die for their crimes, are the only per&s;ons, who collect the poi&s;on, and they are allowed this chance of &s;aving their lives. After &s;entence is pronounced upon them by the judge, they are a&s;ked in court, whether they will die by the hands of the executioner, or go to the upas-tree for a box of poi&s;on? They commonly prefer the latter propo&s;al, as there is not only &s;ome chance of pre&s;erv|ing their lives, but al&s;o a certainty, in ca&s;e of their &s;afe return, that a provi&s;ion will be made for them in future by the emperor. They are al&s;o permitted to a&s;k a favour of the emperor, which is generally of a trifling nature, and u&s;ually granted. They are then provided with a &s;ilver box, in which they are to put the poi&s;onous gum, and are properly in&s;tructed how they are to proceed, while they are upon their dangerous expedition. They are told to pay partic|ular attention to the direction of the winds, as they are to go towards the tree before the wind, &s;o that the effluvia from the tree is always blown from them. They are likewi&s;e directed to travel with the utmo&s;t di&s;patch, as that is the only method of en&s;uring a &s;afe return. They are afterwards &s;ent to the hou&s;e of an old prie&s;t, who lives on the neare&s;t habitable &s;pot, appointed by the emperor to re&s;ide there, for the purpo&s;e of preparing the &s;ouls of tho&s;e criminals for eternity, who are &s;ent to the tree, by prayers and admonitions. To this place they are commonly at|tended by their friends and relations. When the hour of their departure arrives, the prie&s;t puts them on a long leathern cap, with two gla&s;&s;es before their eyes, which comes down as low as their brea&s;t, and al&s;o provides them with a pair of leathern gloves. Thus equipped, they are conducted by the prie&s;t and their
<PB N="128" REF="036664_0127_100A6051A159BC28">
relations about two miles on their journey. Here the prie&s;t repeats his in&s;tructions, and tells them where they are to look for the tree. He &s;hews them a hill, which they are to a&s;cend, and that on the oth|er &s;ide, they will find a rivulet, which will guide them to the upas. They now take leave of each oth|er, and, amid&s;t prayers for their &s;ucce&s;s, the delin|quents ha&s;ten away. Notwith&s;tanding the precau|tions that are taken, there are &s;carcely two out of twenty that e&s;cape. It is certain that from fifteen to eighteen miles round this tree, not only no hu|man creature can exi&s;t, but that, in that &s;pace of ground, no living animal of any kind has ever been di&s;covered. Every man of quality has his dagger or other arms poi&s;oned with the gum of this de&s;tructive tree; and in times of war, the Malayans poi&s;on the &s;prings, and other waters with it; by this treacher|ous practice the Dutch &s;uffered greatly during the la&s;t war, as it occa&s;ioned the lo&s;s of half their army. For this rea&s;on, they have ever &s;ince kept fi&s;h in tho&s;e &s;prings of which they drink, and centinels are placed near them, who in&s;pect the waters every hour, to &s;ee whether the fi&s;h are alive. If they march into an enemy's country, they always carry live fi&s;h with them, which they throw into the water, &s;ome hours before they venture to drink of it, by which means they have been able in &s;ome degree to provide for their &s;ecurity.</P>

Its leaves bear &s;ome re&s;emblance to tho&s;e of the ma|nioc: they are green on the upper part, and white beneath. The &s;eeds are three in number, and con|tained in a pod, con&s;i&s;ting of three cells, not unlike tho&s;e of the palma chri&s;ti; and in each of them there is a kernel, which being &s;tripped and boiled in water&punc; yields a thick oil or fat, which the natives u&s;e for the &s;ame purpo&s;es that we do butter. The juice, which is applied to many different u&s;es, is collected chiefly in time of rain, becau&s;e it flows then mo&s;t a|bundantly. They make an inci&s;ion through the bark, and there i&s;&s;ues from it a milky liquor. It is &s;aid, that the means employed to harden it, is kept a profound &s;ecret.

<P>The nutmeg-tree is found in the Ea&s;t-In|dies, and is &s;aid to re&s;emble a pear-tree; the fruit is inclo&s;ed in four covers; a thick fle&s;hy coat, &s;ome|thing like that of the walnut, contains the whole, which opens of it&s;elf when ripe: under this lies a thin reddi&s;h kind of net-work, of an agreeable &s;mell and aromatic ta&s;te, which we call mace, and is as valua|ble as the fruit it&s;elf: the &s;hell is the third covering, and is hard, thin, and blacki&s;h; under this is a greeni&s;h film, of no u&s;e, and in it is found the nut|meg.

The&s;e birds are not permitted to be killed, on account of this circum&s;tance, as the productions of this tree afford a very lucrative branch of commerce to the Dutch Ea&s;t-India Company, who monopolize the &s;pice-trade, and by that means render it very pro|fitable.

In this light I con&s;ider the de|&s;cription of Hiero's ve&s;&s;el. But to return to the &s;im|ple inventions of the earlie&s;t navigators, the various tribes of &s;avage nations, that inhabit the &s;ea-coa&s;t, will throw the be&s;t light on the &s;ubject. Canoe is the name given to the little boats generally u&s;ed by tho&s;e who dwell in both Indies, as well as by the ne|groes in Guinea. They generally make them of the trunks of trees hollowed out, and &s;ometimes of pieces of bark fa&s;tened together: they differ in &s;ize, accord|ing to the tree of which they are made; they are rowed with paddles, &s;omething like the oars of a boat, and but rarely carry &s;ails. The loading is placed at the bottom; but, as they have no balla&s;t, they are frequently turned up&s;ide down. The want of a rud|der, with which they are not furni&s;hed, is &s;upplied by the hind paddles.

The nar|rowne&s;s and poverty of the land inhabited by the Phoenicians and Tyrians, combining with their na|tural genius for traffic, rendered them the fir&s;t na|tion of navigators among the ancients. Lebanon and the other neighbouring mountains &s;upplying them with excellent wood for &s;hip building, they were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a numerous fleet before other nations had acquired any knowledge in the art beyond that of coa&s;ting in &s;mall ve&s;&s;els. The commerce they e&s;tab|li&s;hed with foreign countries by the means of their &s;kill in naval affairs, enriched them to an extraordi|nary pitch of opulence. The employment given to &s;uch numbers of hands, by this enterpri&s;ing and com|mercial &s;pirit, increa&s;ed the population of the coun|try to &s;uch a degree, that they were obliged to found colonies in other countries, the principal of which was that of Carthage. In time, Carthage became more powerful than the mother country, and extended her navigation into Europe, as far north as Britain. The rival&s;hip that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the &s;tates of Carthage and Rome for many years, ended in the total de&s;truc|tion of the former, and left Rome without a compet|itor.

Eight years were &s;pent in re|peated applications before he &s;ucceeded.

He made a &s;econd voyage without any bet|ter &s;ucce&s;s. Undaunted by &s;o many di&s;appointments, he undertook a third voyage and actually fell in with the va&s;t continent of America; which, after all his indefatigable labour, received its name from a Flor|entine,

<P>The progre&s;s of commerce and navigation naturally keep pace together. Trade fir&s;t gave occa&s;ion to the fitting out large fleets of &s;hips, and as that increa&s;ed, the cargoes became more val|uable, and each nation, jealous of her property, found &s;hips of war nece&s;&s;ary to convoy her merchantmen in &s;afety to their de&s;tined ports. Ships, intended for different purpo&s;es, required a variety of forms and &s;izes, as well as diver&s;ity of con&s;truction and rigging. The form of fi&s;hes being admirably adapted to di|vide the fluid element, and make a way through the waters, furni&s;hed hints to &s;hip-builders in forming the hulks of ve&s;&s;els. Naval architecture comprehends three principal objects. In the fir&s;t place, it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to give the &s;hip &s;uch an exterior form, as may be be&s;t &s;uited to the &s;ervice for which &s;he is de&s;igned. Secondly, to find the proper figures of all the pieces of timber that compo&s;e a &s;hip.

When they begin to build a &s;hip, it is &s;upported up|on &s;trong platforms, inclined towards the water.

Every ob&s;truc|tion being removed, by degrees &s;he &s;lides into the wa|ter. Very large ve&s;&s;els are frequently built in dry docks, and when fini&s;hed, the flood-gates of the dock|yard are opened, and the water ru&s;hes in, and rai&s;es the ve&s;&s;el to the &s;urface.

<P>It is a difficult one, but I will endeav|our to give the company the cleare&s;t idea of them in my power. The fir&s;t piece of timber laid upon the block is generally the keel; the pieces of the keel are &s;carped together, a term u&s;ed for fa&s;tening large pieces of timber together in a manner &s;omewhat &s;imilar to what the carpenters call dove-tail; thus united, they form one entire piece, which con&s;titutes the length of the ve&s;&s;el below. At one extremity of the keel is erected the &s;tem, which is a circular piece of timber,
<PB N="142" REF="036664_0141_100A6072A1F6DAD0">
into which her two &s;ides are fixed at the fore end: at the other extremity of the keel, is elevated the &s;tern|po&s;t, into which are fa&s;tened the after-planks, and in the &s;tern-po&s;t hangs the rudder. The tran&s;oms and fa&s;hion pieces are large pieces of timber that form the width of the &s;hip. The&s;e being &s;trongly united into one frame are elevated upon the &s;tern-po&s;t, and the whole forms the &s;tructure of the &s;tern, upon which the gallaries and windows, with their ornaments, are afterwards built. The &s;tem and &s;tern po&s;t being thus elevated upon the keel, and the keel being rai&s;ed at its two extremities by pieces of wood, the mid&s;hip floor timber is placed acro&s;s the keel. The floor tim|bers, both before and abaft<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Abaft, a &s;ea term for behind.</NOTE> the mid&s;hip frame is then &s;tationed in its proper place upon the keel; af|ter which the kel&s;on, which is the next piece of tim|ber to the keel, and lying directly over it, is fixed acro&s;s the middle of the floor timber. The futtocks, or ribs, which form the &s;ides, are then rai&s;ed upon the floor timbers, and the top timbers being after|wards fa&s;tened to the head of the futtocks, completes the exterior figure of the whole.</P>

<P>You have given us an idea of the external figure of a &s;hip, the in&s;ide fini&s;hing al&s;o requires a great deal of art.

<P>Towards the end of the eleventh century, the zeal of a fanatical monk, called Peter the Hermit, who conceived the idea of leading all the forces of Chri&s;tendom again&s;t the infidels, and of driving them out of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Holy-Land, was &s;ufficient to give a beginning to this wild under|taking. He ran from province to province with a crucifix in his hand, exciting princes and people to this holy war. Wherever he came, they caught the infection of his enthu&s;ia&s;m, not only nobles and war|riors, but men in the more humble &s;tations of life: &s;hepherds left their flocks, and mechanics their oc|cupations; nay, even women and children engaged with ardour in this enterpri&s;e, which was e&s;teemed &s;acred and meritorious; contemporary authors a&s;&s;ert, that &s;ix millions of per&s;ons a&s;&s;umed the cro&s;s, which was the badge that di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;uch as devoted them|&s;elves to this holy warfare.

It was not po&s;&s;ible for the cru&s;aders to travel through &s;o many countries without receiving information and improvement, which they commu|nicated to their re&s;pective countries, at their return. The nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ion and accommodation for &s;uch va&s;t numbers of people excited a &s;pirit of commerce, and in its con&s;equences advanced the progre&s;s of navi|gation; a &s;pirit of improvement is rai&s;ed by the com|munication of different nations; tho&s;e people, who are de&s;titute of commerce, remain a long time &s;ta|tionary.</P>

<P>The tea-tree, according to Linnaeus, is of the polyandria monogynia cla&s;s; the cup is a very &s;mall, plane, permanent, perianthium, divided into five or &s;ix roundi&s;h obtu&s;e leaves; the flower con&s;i&s;ts of &s;ix or nine large roundi&s;h, concave, and equal pe|tals; the &s;tamina are numerous filaments, about two hundred, and are very &s;lender, capillary, and &s;hort|er than the flower; the antherae are &s;imple: the ger|men of the pe&s;til is globo&s;e and trigonal; the &s;tyle is &s;ubulated, and of the length of the &s;tamina; the &s;tigma is &s;imple; the fruit is a cap&s;ule, formed of three globular bodies growing together; it contains three cells, and opens into three parts at the top. The &s;eeds are &s;ingle, globo&s;e, and internally annu|lated. It is &s;uppo&s;ed that there is but one &s;pecies of this tree, and that the difference between green and bohea tea, con&s;i&s;ts only in the manner of cultivation, and drying the leaves. The root re&s;embles that of the peach-tree, the leaves are long and narrow, and jagged all round. The flower is much like that of the wild ro&s;e, but &s;maller; the fruit contains two or three &s;eeds of a mou&s;e colour, including each a kernel. The&s;e are the &s;eeds by which the plant is propagated; &s;everal of the&s;e are put promi&s;cuou&s;ly into a hole, four or five inches deep, at proper di&s;tances from each other, and require no other care.

among the Chine&s;e.

<P>The leaves con&s;titute the tea we u&s;e; the be&s;t time to gather them is whil&s;t they are &s;mall, young, and juicy; they are plucked carefully one by one; and, notwith&s;tanding the tediou&s;ne&s;s of this op|eration, the labourers are able to gather from four to fifteen pounds each, in one day. The buildings, or drying hou&s;es, that are erected for curing tea, con|tain from five to twenty &s;mall furnaces, each having at the top a large flat iron-pan. There is al&s;o a long low table, covered with mats, on which the leaves are laid, and rolled by workmen, who &s;it round it; the iron-pan being heated to a certain degree, by a little fire made in the furnace underneath, a few pounds of the fre&s;h gathered leaves are put upon the pan, the fre&s;h and juicy leaves crack when they touch the pan, and it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the operator to &s;hift them as quick as po&s;&s;ible with his bare hands, till they become too hot to be endured. At this in|&s;tant he takes off the leaves with a kind of &s;hovel, and pours them on the mats before the rollers, who, taking &s;mall quantities at a time, roll, them in the palms of their hands in one direction, while others
<PB N="153" REF="036664_0152_100A608AF5E126E0">
are fanning them, that they may cool the more &s;peed|ily, and retain their curl the longer. This proce&s;s is repeated two or three times, or oftener, before the tea is put into the &s;tores, in order that all the moi&s;ture of the leaves may be thoroughly di&s;&s;ipated, and their curl more completely pre&s;erved. On every repeti|tion the pan is le&s;s heated, and the operation per|formed more &s;lowly and cautiou&s;ly; the tea is then &s;eparated into the different kinds, and depo&s;ited in the &s;tore for dome&s;tic u&s;e or exportation. The Chi|ne&s;e drink tea more frequently than the Europeans; it is the chief treat, with which they regale their friends; and it is &s;aid, that it is a branch of polite education in that country, to learn to infu&s;e and &s;erve it gracefully. It was introduced into Europe, very early in the la&s;t century by the Dutch Ea&s;t-India company. About the year 1666, a quantity of it was imported from Holland, by Lord Arlington, and Lord O&s;&s;ory, at which time it was &s;old for &s;ixty &s;hillings a pound. The pre&s;ent con&s;umption of it is immen&s;e, nineteen millions of pounds being annually imported &s;ince the commutation act took place.</P>

<P>The cacao, or chocolate-nut, is a na|tive of South-America, and is &s;aid to have been orig|inally conveyed to Hi&s;paniola from &s;ome of the prov|inces of New Spain, where it was not only u&s;ed as an article of nouri&s;hment by the natives, but likewi&s;e &s;erved the purpo&s;e of money, being employed as a medium in barter; one hundred and fifty of the nuts were con&s;idered as nearly equivalent to a ryal by the Spaniards. It is a genus of the polyadelphia pen|tandria cla&s;s; the flower has five petals, and five erect &s;tamina; in the centre is placed the oval ger|men, which afterwards becomes an oblong pod, end|ing in a point, which is divided into five cells, filled with oval, compre&s;&s;ed, fle&s;hy &s;eeds. The cacao-tree, both in &s;ize and &s;hape, has &s;ome re&s;emblance to a young black-heart cherry-tree.

<P>The fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s of the planter is to chu&s;e a &s;uitable &s;pot for the purpo&s;e. A deep black mould is the &s;oil be&s;t adapted to the growth of the chocolate-tree; it &s;hould be a level piece of land, &s;heltered round with a thick wood, &s;o as to be well &s;creened from the wind, e&s;pecially the north; after having cleared it from all manner of &s;tumps and weeds, the planter digs a number of holes, at eigh|teen or twenty feet di&s;tance. Having previously &s;e|lected the large&s;t and faire&s;t pods of the cacao, when
<PB N="156" REF="036664_0155_100A60920E5FEA98">
full ripe, he takes out the grains, and puts them in|to a ve&s;&s;el of water; &s;uch of them as &s;wim he rejects, the others, being wa&s;hed clean from the pulp, and &s;kinned, are &s;uffered to remain in the water till they begin to &s;prout, when they are fit for planting. His next work is to take the leaves of the banana, or &s;ome other large leaf, one of which he places in the circumference of each hole, &s;o as to line it within &s;ide; leaving the &s;ides of the leaf &s;ome inches above the ground, after which he rubs the mould in very light|ly, till the hole is filled; three nuts are then cho&s;en for each hole, and planted triangularly, by making a &s;mall opening for each with his finger, about two inches deep, into which he puts the nuts with that end downwards from which the &s;prout i&s;&s;ues, and having lightly covered them with mould, he folds the edges of the leaf over them, and places a &s;mall &s;tone on the top, to prevent its opening. In the &s;pace of about eight or ten days, the young &s;hoots begin to make their appearance above the earth, and call once more for the attendance of the plant|er, who unfolds the banana leaves, that the growth of the tender plant may not be impeded; in or|der to &s;helter them from the &s;un, other leaves or branches are placed round the hole, and they are changed as often as they decay, during five or &s;ix months. Such tender care does the cacao require, and &s;o requi&s;ite is &s;hade to its growth and pro&s;perity, that, be&s;ides the precautions I have mentioned, they are obliged to plant &s;ome other tree to the &s;outh-we&s;t of the plant, which may grow up with it, and &s;erve it for &s;helter again&s;t the &s;corching rays of the &s;un; the erythina, or bean-tree, is generally cho&s;en for this purpo&s;e. In the fifth year it begins to repay the cultivator for his trouble, and by the time it has &s;tood eight years, attains its full perfection. It gen|erally produces two crops of fruit in the year, and will &s;ometimes continue bearing for twenty years. The &s;ame delicacy of &s;tamina, which characteri&s;es its infancy, is apparent in all the &s;tages of its growth;

<P>I imagine that the profit it brings, when it &s;ucceeds, is the inducement to the at|tempt; nothing is to be effected without pains and labour; we cannot learn the &s;imple&s;t mechanical op|eration without repeated efforts; con&s;ider what num|berle&s;s attempts an infant makes to walk or &s;peak, before it can either articulate a perfect &s;ound, or pro|ceed a few &s;teps by it&s;elf. In the &s;ame manner, the habit of performing mo&s;t of the common operations of the body, which we practi&s;e, as it were in&s;en&s;ibly, when we have arrived at maturity, are acquired by almo&s;t imperceptible degrees: a child learns to judge of the di&s;tances of objects by experience, as of the di&s;tance and nature of &s;ounds. The powers of &s;mel|ling, ta&s;ting, feeling, hearing, and &s;eeing, exi&s;t in a new born infant, though a con&s;iderable &s;pace of time pa&s;&s;es, before it is capable of reaping much benefit from them; repeated and continual practice, at length enables it to &s;ee, hear, ta&s;te, feel, and &s;mell, with accuracy and preci&s;ion, if it be born with per|fect organs. This &s;hould teach us never to de&s;pair of attaining any degree of perfection in virtue or knowledge, of which our nature is capable. If in|dolence, pride, avarice, or anger, are the leading propen&s;ities of a man's di&s;po&s;ition, let him war with determined re&s;olution and unremitted care again&s;t that particular vice, to which he feels him&s;elf prone, and he will certainly come off victorious in the com|bat; re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t a predominant inclination is at fir&s;t painful, by repetition it is rendered ea&s;y, and

<P>The po&s;&s;ibility of overcoming vicious inclinations, and correcting what is common|ly called our nature, is finely exemplified in the &s;tory of Socrates and the phy&s;iogomi&s;t. A man, who pretended to di&s;cover the characteri&s;tic marks of the di&s;po&s;ition and affectious, by the lines of the face, was introduced to Socrates, without knowing the philo&s;opher, and de&s;ired to declare, by the rules of his art, what kind of per&s;on Socrates was. He repli|ed, after ob&s;erving his countenance attentively, that he was a drunkard, and a glutton, pa&s;&s;ionate, and a &s;lave to vice in general. Upon which the company ridiculed his want of di&s;cernment, and denied all de|pendance on the truth of phy&s;iognomy; but Socra|tes reproved their ra&s;hne&s;s, acknowledging that in his youth he felt him&s;elf powerfully inclined to the very vices the man had named, but that per&s;everance and re&s;olution had enabled him to overcome them, and all pre&s;ent knew that he had attained &s;uch com|mand over him&s;elf, as to be celebrated as a model of virtue and morality. My dear Henry mu&s;t lay a&s;ide his intention of entertaining us with the hi&s;tory of coffee, till to-morrow evening. It is too late to be|gin a fre&s;h subject. Adieu; adieu.</P>

of my promi&s;e, though I feel my&s;elf &s;carce|ly equal to the ta&s;k. The coffee-tree is a genus of the pentandria monogynia cla&s;s; the flower has one petal, which is funnel &s;haped; it has five &s;tamina, which are fa&s;tened to the tube, the roundi&s;h germen afterwards becomes an oval berry, containing two &s;eeds, in &s;hape like a half globe, flat on one &s;ide, and convex on the other. This tree originally came from Arabia Felix; but is now cultivated with &s;ucce&s;s in the Briti&s;h We&s;t-Indies. It is a low tree, even in its native &s;oil, &s;eldom exceeding &s;ixteen or eighteen feet high. In the We&s;t-India i&s;lands the negroes are em|ployed to gather the berries; as &s;oon as they change their colour to a dark red, they are fit for gathering. Each negro is provided with a canvas bag, with a hoop in the mouth of it, too keep it open; it is hung about the neck of the picker, who occa&s;ionally emp|ties into a ba&s;ket; and if he be indu&s;trious, he may pick three bu&s;hels in the day.

<P>There are two methods in u&s;e of curing or drying the bean. The one is to &s;pread the fre&s;h coffee in the &s;un, in layers about five inches deep on a &s;loping terrace, or platform of boards, with the pulp on the berry, which in a few days ferments, and discharges it&s;elf in a &s;trong acidulous moi&s;ture; and in this &s;tate the coffee is left, till it is perfectly dry, which, if the weather is favourable, it will be in about three weeks. The hu&s;ks are afterwards &s;eparated from the &s;eeds by a grinding mill, or frequently by pounding them with pe&s;tles in troughs, or large wood|en mortars. The other mode is to pulp it immedi|ately as it comes from the tree, which is done by a pulping-mill; the pulp and the bean (in its parch|ment &s;kin or membrane which enclo&s;es it) fall pro|mi&s;cuou&s;ly

<P>The coffee-berries are generally roa&s;ted before we u&s;e them. They are put into a tin cylindrical box, full of holes; through the mid|dle of which runs a &s;pit: beneath this machine is placed a &s;emi-circular hearth, in which is lighted a large charcoal fire: by help of a jack the &s;pit turns &s;wiftly, and in that manner roa&s;ts the berries equally. When the oil ri&s;es, and is become of a dark brown colour, it is emptied into two receivers, the bottoms of which are iron plates: then the coffee is &s;haken, and left till almo&s;t cold; and if it looks bright and oily, it is a &s;ign it is well done.

The only di&s;|tinction between the black and the white ginger con|&s;i&s;ts in the different modes of curing the roots.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Commerce and traffic, either between nations or individuals, may be divided into two great articles, under one of which all the re&s;t may be cla&s;&s;ed, viz. the raw material, or natural &s;ub|&s;tances, before they are changed or transformed by the inventions of art, &s;uch as corn, wool, iron, &amp;c. and the various productions of nature, wrought and altered into innumerable compo&s;itions, by the indu&s;|try and ingenuity of man. The globe, which we inhabit, may be compared to a va&s;t &s;torehou&s;e, where an infinite variety of raw materials are laid up, ready for the exerci&s;e of invention and diligence. Few things in their natural &s;tate are adapted to our u&s;e, though &s;carcely the meane&s;t is void of utility, when compounded with other &s;ub&s;tances, or tran&s;formed by the action of fire, or changed by chemical pro|ce&s;&s;es, or wrought by manual labour: a convincing proof, that a life of &s;loth and inactivity is not &s;uited to our nature, and that no rank, however exalted, is exempt from labour. The vegetable, mineral, and animal kingdoms equally contribute to furni&s;h mat|ter for us to work upon. You may remember that the clear, tran&s;parent, beautiful ware, we call gla&s;s, is formed only of &s;and and a&s;hes; and you will pre|&s;ently be informed that the elegant manufacture of porcelain, or China-ware, is compo&s;ed of &s;tones.

capable of affording any entertainment. The art of making porcelain is one of tho&s;e in which the orien|tal nations have excelled the Europeans; it is chiefly manufactured in China, from whence it takes its name, but it is al&s;o brought into Europe, from other parts of the Ea&s;t, particularly Japan, Siam, Surat, and Per&s;ia. Neither the inventor, nor the period of its invention, is known, the Chine&s;e annals being &s;i|lent on the &s;ubject.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Although we mu&s;t acknowledge that the Orientals are &s;uperior to us in this art, yet Europe has e&s;tabli&s;hed manufactures for &s;everal years, that have produced wares but little inferior to tho&s;e of our ea&s;tern ma&s;ters. The fir&s;t European porce|lains are &s;aid to have been made in Saxony. France followed her example, then England, afterwards Germany and Italy. Each of the&s;e manufactures differed from tho&s;e of Japan and China, and re&s;|pectively po&s;&s;e&s;s a di&s;tinct character of its own.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Connoi&s;&s;eurs in porcelain have valu|ed &s;ome of the produce of the manufacture of Mei&s;&s;en, a few miles from Dre&s;den, the capital of Saxony, at even a higher rate than tho&s;e of China: on account of the &s;uperior excellence of the painting and enamelling. The Saxons attribute the invention to an alchymi&s;t, named Betticher, who was confined in the ca&s;tle of Koning&s;tein, by the king of Poland, on a &s;u&s;picion that he was ma&s;ter of the &s;ecret of the philo&s;ophers &s;tone, which was &s;uppo&s;ed by credulous per&s;ons, to po&s;&s;e&s;s the power of converting all metals into gold. Unable, with all his efforts, to obtain the &s;ubject of his re&s;earches, he employed his lei&s;ure in more u&s;eful experiments, and di&s;covered the means of making a ware, which by its excellence and value, continues to enrich his country. His death happened in the year 1719. Among the French porcelains, that of the late king's manufactory at Sevres is the mo&s;t e&s;|teemed. The Chel&s;ea China is but little inferior to tho&s;e of Saxony and France, but being expen&s;ive, and adapted chiefly to ornamental purpo&s;es, is of no
<PB N="165" REF="036664_0164_100A60A7FB72B060" MS="y">
very general advantage. Of the other manufacto|ries e&s;tabli&s;hed in this country, that of Worce&s;ter is be&s;t &s;uited to common u&s;e, as it wears well, and comes cheap. Sophia has acquainted her&s;elf with the materials, and manner of manufacturing this com|modity in the porcelain works in China, which will be &s;ufficient to give us a general idea of the &s;ubject, without entering into the particulars of the manu|factures of Europe, they being all formed upon one principle, however they may vary in minute differ|ences.</P>

<P>M. Reaumur be&s;towed great pains in an|aly&s;ing the component parts of the ea&s;tern China, and found that it con&s;i&s;ted of two &s;ub&s;tances, one of which is ea&s;ily vitrified, or converted into gla&s;s, the other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a contrary quality; the combination of tho&s;e oppo&s;ite materials produces porcelain, which is a half vitrified &s;ub&s;tance, or manufacture, in a middle &s;tate, between the common baked earthen ware of our cour&s;e manufactures, and true gla&s;s. This compo&s;ition makes a very curious article in commerce, and not le&s;s &s;o in natural hi&s;tory. In or|der to proceed with method, I &s;hall con&s;ider four things; the materials that compo&s;e it; the art of giving the proper figure and &s;hape to the different works; the colours with which it is painted, gilded and enamelled; and la&s;tly, the baking, or expo&s;ing it to the proper degree of fire. There are two kinds of earths, and as many different oils, or varni&s;hes, u&s;ed in the compo&s;ition of porcelain. The fir&s;t earth, called kaolin, is intermixed with glittering cor|pu&s;cles; the &s;econd, named petun&s;e, is plain white, but exceedingly fine. They are both found in quar|ries twenty or thirty leagues from Kingteching, the name of the town where the mo&s;t con&s;iderable China-works are carried on, and to this place, the&s;e earths, or rather &s;tones, are brought in a number of little barks, ince&s;&s;antly pa&s;&s;ing up and down the river Iaotcheou for that purpo&s;e. The petun&s;es are cut from the quarries in form of bricks, being naturally
<PB N="166" REF="036664_0165_100A60AAC3254470" MS="y">
pieces of a very hard rock; tho&s;e are mo&s;tly valued&punc; of which the colour inclines to a greeni&s;h hue. The fir&s;t preparation of the&s;e bricks is to break and pound them, till they are rendered impalpable, or as fine as can be conceived. This powder is thrown into an urn, full of water, and &s;tirred bri&s;kly about with an iron in&s;trument. After letting it &s;tand &s;till a while, the lighter parts of the powder form a &s;kim on the &s;urface of the water, &s;everal inches thick, which the workmen carefully &s;kim off into another ve&s;&s;el filled with water, leaving the heavier &s;ediment at the bottom to be reground. The &s;econd ve&s;&s;el is left to &s;ettle, and when it has &s;tood long enough, they pour off the clear water, and re&s;erve the matter, which &s;ub&s;ides, for u&s;e: when it is nearly dry, it is cut into &s;quare pieces, and afterwards mixed with kaolin in proper proportion. The kaolin is much &s;ofter than the petun&s;e, when dug out of the quarry; yet this is the ingredient, which, by its mixture with the other, gives &s;trength and firmne&s;s to the work. The mountains, whence the kaolin is dug, are covered on the out&s;ide &s;urface with a reddi&s;h earth. The mines are deep, and the matter is found in glebes or clods. They prepare both the&s;e &s;tones in a &s;imilar manner.</P>

<PB N="167" REF="036664_0166_100A60ACE9875900">
this &s;tate, it is mixed with a mineral &s;tone, called &s;hekau or kehao, re&s;embling alum, which they fir&s;t heat red hot, and then reduce into an impalpable powder; this gives the oil a con&s;i&s;tence, but it &s;hould not be made too thick, as it is &s;till to be kept in a liquid &s;tate. The fourth ingredient is the oil of lime, which requires a more tedious and difficult proce&s;s. After di&s;&s;olving large pieces of quick lime, and re|ducing them to a powder, by &s;prinkling water on them, they put a layer of fern on this powder, and on the fern, another of the &s;lacked lime, and &s;o on alternately, till they have heaped a moderate pile, to which they &s;et fire; when the whole is con&s;umed, they compo&s;e another pile of layers of the a&s;hes, and new layers of dry fern, which they burn as be|fore; this operation is repeated five or &s;ix times, the oil being reckoned better, the oftener the a&s;hes are burned. A quantity of the&s;e a&s;hes of fern and lime is thrown into an urn filled with water, and to one hundred pounds of a&s;hes, is added one pound of &s;he|kau, which di&s;&s;olves in it; the re&s;t of the proce&s;s is the &s;ame as in preparing the earth of the petun&s;es: the &s;ediment found at the bottom of the &s;econd urn, kept in a liquid &s;tate, is called the oil of lime, from which the porcelain derives its principal lu&s;tre.</P>

<P>MY father has promi&s;ed to take me tomorrow, to &s;ee a gentleman's mu&s;eum, which is filled with rarieties and valuable curio&s;ities; among other things, he tells me that there are &s;everal philo&s;ophical in&s;truments, and that I am to &s;ee a variety of experiments. I &s;hould antic|ipate a great deal of plea&s;ure in this vi&s;it, were I not entirely ignorant of the &s;ubjects with which I am to be entertained; &s;o many things ari&s;e in my mind, which I wi&s;h to enquire about, le&s;t I &s;hould expo&s;e my ignorance before &s;trangers, that I find it difficult to &s;elect the que&s;tions mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;k.</P>

<P>A con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of our defects is the fir&s;t &s;tep towards improvement; a young lady of your age is not expected to be deeply &s;killed in philo&s;ophy; much le&s;s to di&s;play her knowledge, &s;hould &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;mall &s;hare; but a general ac|quaintance with the u&s;es of the mo&s;t common philo|&s;ophical in&s;truments is not only ornamental, but al&s;o a very u&s;eful accompli&s;hment, and &s;hould form part of every liberal education.</P>

<P>My father mentioned &s;everal particu|lars, that are to be &s;hewn me; tele&s;copes, micro&s;copes, and an orrery e&s;pecially; but I am quite unacquaint|ed with the purpo&s;es to which any of them are ap|plied.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>In order to prepare your mind for your intended vi&s;it, we will defer our conclu&s;ion of the porcelain manufacture till our next meeting, and endeavour to explain the u&s;es to which &s;ome of the mo&s;t common philo&s;ophical in&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uments are ap|plied. To enter into a de&s;cription of their con&s;truc|tion, or an explanation of their parts, would be un|intere&s;ting and tedious, unle&s;s we had the machines before us. We will begin with the tele&s;cope, as pre|&s;enting the mo&s;t con&s;picuous, important, and noble objects in nature. It is an optical in&s;trument, con|&s;i&s;ting

of &s;everal gla&s;&s;es or len&s;es, fitted into a tube, through which remote objects are viewed as if near. Before the invention of the tele&s;cope, the wonders of the heavens were concealed from us beyond the pow|ers of the naked eye; and a&s;tronomy, that exalted &s;cience, which illu&s;trates the Omnipotence of the Di|vine Creator of the univer&s;e more eminently than any other branch of human knowledge, has been improv|ed, and brought, by this &s;imple in&s;trument, to a de|gree of perfection unthought of, in former ages. The di&s;covery was owing to chance rather than reflection, as it is certain, that the theory, upon which it de|pends, was not known when the fir&s;t tele&s;copes were made. Several cliamed the honour of the invention but Galileo, in the beginning of the &s;eventeenth centu|ry, having been told of a certain optic gla&s;s made in Holland, which brought di&s;tant objects nearer to the eye con&s;idered by what means this effect could be produced, and grinding two pieces of gla&s;s into form as well as he could, fitted them to the ends of an or|gan pipe, and with this indifferent apparatus &s;hewed at once the novelty and wonder of the invention to the Venetian noble&s;&s;e, on the top of the tower of St. Mark. From this time Galileo devoted him&s;elf wholly to the improving and perfecting of the tele&s;|cope, and by his per&s;everance de&s;erved the honour, u&s;ually attributed to him, of being the inventor of the in&s;trument, and of its receiving the denomination of Galileo's tube, from his name. The Doge of Ve|nice rewarded his a&s;&s;iduity with the ducal letters, and doubled his &s;alary.</P>

<P>The extraordinary talents of this great man improved the fir&s;t invention of the tele&s;|cope to a va&s;t degree of perfection; but it has been re&s;erved for the period in which we live, to advance the magnifying powers to a height at once truly a&s;|toni&s;hing. Our cotemporary, Dr. Her&s;chel, has made &s;urpri&s;ing progre&s;s in cele&s;tial geography, if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion, by means of his New|tonian &s;even feet reflector, the mo&s;t powerful in&s;tru|ment of the kind ever &s;een. It has enabled him to

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>When the immen&s;e and inconceivable di&s;tances of the fixed &s;tars are con&s;idered, it is won|derful to reflect that the inventive powers, of &s;uch a diminutive animal as man, have ever attained to &s;uch degrees of information on a &s;ubject apparently &s;o far beyond his reach.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HENRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not think that the &s;tars are &s;o very far di&s;tant. On a clear night I have ob&s;erved them but a little way above my head. I have tried &s;everal times to count them, but they are &s;o numerous that I have always found it impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>You art very much deceived, my dear brother, in both re&s;pects. The &s;tars, that are vi&s;ible to the naked eye, are not &s;o numerous as we are apt to &s;uppo&s;e, from viewing them in a confu&s;ed irregu|lar manner; a thou&s;and is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the great|e&s;t number even &s;een in our hemi&s;phere at one time, by the keene&s;t eye, and mo&s;t attentive ob&s;erver. Their extreme di&s;tance conceals them from our &s;ight, except when they are unveiled by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tele&s;copes, for they are really numerous beyond our F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ited imagination to conceive; and in order to give you a faint idea of their va&s;t di&s;tance, I will re|late a few ob&s;ervations that I have heard upon the &s;ubject. Nothing, that we know, is &s;o &s;wift in its pa&s;&s;age as light; a ray of light pa&s;&s;es from the &s;un to the earth in eight minutes and thirteen &s;econds, a di&s;tance of ninety-five millions, one hundred and twen|ty-three thou&s;and miles; and yet, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing this amazing velocity, it would be one year and a quarter traver&s;ing the &s;pace between us and the near|e&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t fixed &s;tar. A cannon ball, di&s;charged from a twenty-four pounder with two-thirds of its weight of powder, moves at about the rate of nineteen miles in a minute, but would be &s;even hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and years pa&s;&s;ing from the neare&s;t fixed &s;tar to our earth.

<P>How far does the &s;tructure of the uni|ver&s;e, viewed in this light, exceed the bounds of the &s;tronge&s;t imagination! well might David expre&s;s his &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e wonders, by exclaiming, that the Heavens declare the glory of God, and the firma|ment &s;heweth his handy work.</P>

<P>Addi&s;on remarks, that the univer&s;e is the work of infinite power, prompted by infinite good|ne&s;s, having an infinite &s;pace to exert it&s;elf in, &s;o that our imagination can &s;et no limits to it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>The micro&s;cope is an in&s;tru|ment calculated to &s;hew the other extreme of nature's works, by magnifying very minute objects, &s;o as to render that clear to the &s;ight, which from its mi|nutene&s;s&punc; was before imperceptible. Dr. Hooke, who h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> written on the micro&s;cope, divides the ob|jects proper to be viewed by it into three cla&s;&s;es, which he calls exceeding &s;mall bodies, exceeding &s;mall pores, and exceeding &s;mall motions. Small bodies mu&s;t either be the parts of larger bodies, or things, the whole of which is too minute for our ob|&s;ervation&punc; una&s;&s;i&s;ted by art; &s;uch as &s;mall &s;eeds, in|&s;ects, &s;alts, &s;ands, &amp;c. Very &s;mall pores are the in|ter&s;tices between the &s;olid parts of bodies, as in &s;tones, timbers, minerals, &s;hells, &amp;c. or the mouths of mi|nute ve&s;&s;els in vegetables, or the pores in the &s;kin, bones, and other parts of animals. Extreme &s;mall motions are the movements of the &s;everal parts or members of minute animals, or the motion of the fluids, contained in either animal or vegetable bodies. Under one or other of the&s;e three heads, almo&s;t every thing around us affords matter of ob&s;ervation, and may conduce to our amu&s;ement and in&s;truction.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>

children, that may enlarge and exalt your ideas of the great fir&s;t Cau&s;e, from whom every thing pro|ceeds, and by whom every thing is arranged and gov|erned in the mo&s;t perfect order; whether we reflect on the heavenly bodies, tho&s;e &s;tupendous in&s;tances of his omnipotence: or con&s;ider the in&s;ect imper|ceptible by its minutene&s;s, yet perfect in all its parts, both internal and external, we are led equally to ad|mire and adore the &s;ame power, wi&s;dom and good|ne&s;s, that are manife&s;ted in each extreme of his works.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>The order of the univer&s;e is an inexhau&s;tible theme of wonder and admiration to all who con&s;ider it attentively; the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t virtous men of all ages have uniformly agreed in admiring the connection of its parts, and the cor|re&s;pondence of means to the end de&s;igned. Of what u&s;e would the eye have been, with all its curious me|chani&s;m, if there had been no light to render objects vi&s;ible?

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the harmony of works of Providence is &s;o obvious to the mo&s;t &s;uper|ficial ob&s;erver, I have heard that there have been men &s;o perver&s;ely &s;tupid, as to &s;uppo&s;e, that this beautiful world, with all its various inhabitants, as well as the other parts of the univer&s;e, were produ|ced by mere chance, or the accidental a&s;&s;emblage of atoms, and have refu&s;ed to acknowledge the exi&s;t|ence of one Supreme Intelligent Being.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>If any man indeed ever doubt|ed of that awful truth, he mu&s;t have fir&s;t bewildered his mind in u&s;ele&s;s and unprofitable &s;peculations on metaphy&s;ical and ab&s;tru&s;e &s;ubjects, beyond our lim|ited capacities to explore, and ill &s;uited to make us either wi&s;er or better.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Natural religion, or the belief of the exi&s;tence of a God, the Creator and Pre&s;erver of the Univer&s;e, for the manife&s;tation of his power, wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, is not confined to the globe which we inhabit, but extends to the remote&s;t point of created &s;pace, is &s;o congenial to our rational na|ture, that it is &s;urpri&s;ing that any one ever dared to acknowledge a doubt of it.</P>

<P>The united te&s;timony of all ages and nations concurs to render &s;uch men &s;u&s;pected of profe&s;&s;ing a belief, which in the privacy of their own minds they deny, or of wilfully refu&s;ing to open their under&s;tandings to the convictions of truth. The mo&s;t &s;avage and ignorant tribes in every part of the globe, not only acknowledge the exi&s;tence of a Su|preme Cau&s;e, though they wor&s;hip him under dif|ferent names, and frequently mi&s;take very ab&s;urd objects for his repre&s;entatives; but al&s;o an univer&s;al belief of his divine influence upon the human mind; from this conviction ari&s;es the idea of prayer, a cu&s;|tom confined to no particular country, but the uni|ver&s;al refuge of the human &s;pecies in moments of di&s;tre&s;s and angui&s;h; an a&s;&s;urance, that he graci|ou&s;ly conde&s;cends to hear the petitions of his crea|tures, and benevolently relieves their affliction, mu&s;t give encouragement to the&s;e applications.</P>

<P>The period of man's life is too &s;hort to be wa&s;ted in &s;peculative re&s;earches, which have no influence in correcting the di&s;po&s;ition, or a|mending the heart. The path of duty is plain and obvious to every one who &s;incerely endeavours to find it, and is equally adapted to the capacity of the unlettered hind, as to that of the learned philo&s;o|pher.

kinds demand a greater quantity of kaolin than the coar&s;er &s;orts. Kneading and tewing the two earths together is the mo&s;t laborious part of the work, which operation is performed in large ba&s;ons or pits, well paved and cemented, in which the workmen trample the materials with their feet, till the ma&s;s be well incorporated, and becomes of a con&s;i&s;tence re|qui&s;ite for the u&s;e of the potter. When taken out of the ba&s;ons, they are obliged to knead it again with their hands, after having divided it into &s;maller pieces. On this operation the perfection of the work depends, as the intervention of the &s;malle&s;t body, or the minute&s;t vacuity, would be &s;ufficient to &s;poil the whole: a grain of &s;and, or a &s;ingle hair will &s;ome|times cau&s;e the porcelain to crack, &s;plinter, run, or warp.</P>

the Chine&s;e are exceedingly deficient, and mu&s;t therefore yield the palm undi&s;puted to the Eu|ropeans in the&s;e re&s;pects; as the fine&s;t tints, laid on without ta&s;te or judgment, can only produce a glar|ing effect upon the eye, but are in&s;ufficient to plea&s;e a correct fancy.

<P>The colours applied to porcelain are the &s;ame as tho&s;e u&s;ed in enamel painting, and con&s;i&s;t of metallic calces, which are the re&s;idue of metals, af|ter calcination by fire, or &s;olution by chemical pro|ce&s;&s;es. With de&s;ign to form colours for painting on china or enamel, they brui&s;e the&s;e calces, and incor|porate them with a very fu&s;ible gla&s;s. Crocus of iron affords a red colour; Ca&s;&s;ius's precipitate of gold makes the purple and violet; copper calcined by acids, and precipitated by an alkali, gives a fine green; zaffre makes the blue; earths &s;lightly fer|ruginous produce a yellow; and la&s;tly, brown and black colours are effected by calcined iron, mixed with a deep blue of zaffre. The&s;e colours are ground with gum-water, or oil of &s;pike, to render them fit for u&s;e. I am indebted to my mother for all that I have related concerning the colours, and I hope I have repeated it without mi&s;take. A powder or calx of gold is applied, as in the coloured enamels, for the gilding: the painted and gilded porcelains are expo&s;ed to a fire capable of fu&s;ing the gla&s;s, with which the metallic colours are mixed; by this means they adhere, and acquire a glo&s;s equal to that of the glazing of the china. The gold receives additional brightne&s;s from burni&s;hing it with a blood &s;tone.</P>

<P>The two fir&s;t kinds are frequent|ly made by the arti&s;ts who apply them to their re&s;|pective u&s;es; but the la&s;t comes chiefly from Venice and Holland in the form of little thin cakes of dif|ferent &s;izes, impre&s;&s;ed with the maker's name, or &s;ome device adopted by him, as the &s;un, &amp;c.

Of all the&s;e, the &s;imple white is of the mo&s;t general u&s;e; by uniting it with azure, it be|comes &s;late-colour; the addition of copper and cy|prus vitriol makes it a &s;ky blue; that of perige<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, a fle&s;h colour; iron ru&s;t renders it yellow; and cop|per filings change it to green.</P>

The invention of opake or thick colours is of much later date, and is an improvement upon the tran&s;parent method: this di&s;covery has produced many exqui&s;ite pieces of modern art, pre&s;enting por|traits and events from hi&s;tory in as great perfection as the be&s;t paintings in oil; but with this important advantage, that they pre&s;erve their beauty and lu&s;|tre

Although we owe the improvement of this art, in its pre&s;ent &s;tate of perfection, to the moderns, the orig|inal invention of giving colours to gla&s;s, upon which the &s;y&s;tem of enamel painting is founded, is extreme|ly ancient. I think we read of beautiful va&s;es, cu|riou&s;ly enamelled with figures, being made in Tu&s;|cany, whil&s;t Por&s;enna was king of that country. A later period produced many admirable &s;pecimens of the &s;ame di&s;covery in the duchy of Urbino, enriched by the inimitable pencil of Raphael, which are &s;till to be &s;een in the cabinets of the patrons of the fine arts, under the name of Raphael's ware.</P>

It &s;hould be laid on very &s;moothly with a bru&s;h, and when the paper is almo&s;t dry, it &s;hould be pre&s;&s;ed between boards. Two &s;heets of paper, cemented together with this mixture, make a &s;uitable &s;ub&s;tance for this &s;pecies of painting, which con&s;i&s;ts of dots or fine &s;trokes of the pencil. It is an elegant art, and well adapted to vary the amu&s;ements of young wo|men, who have lei&s;ure and ta&s;te to pur&s;ue it. The capacity of repre&s;enting a lively image of a flower or a bird, may be ranked among&s;t the higher accompli&s;h|ments; but the power of delineating the human countenance is very much &s;uperior to it; particular|ly that branch of de&s;ign which enables the arti&s;t to convey to the ivory or canva&s;s the re&s;emblance of an individual endeared by friend&s;hip. My dear girls, you have already attained a tolerable degree of ex|cellence in the u&s;e of the pencil, it will be ea&s;y for you to ri&s;e higher, and adorn my clo&s;et with the like|ne&s;&s;es of tho&s;e friends that are deare&s;t to us.</P>

<P>They are generally taken from October to February: it is forbidden by act of par|liament to catch them in this manner from the fir&s;t of June to the fir&s;t of October. On the approach of winter, they migrate from more northern countries into our milder climate, where the cold is &s;eldom &s;o inten&s;e as to freeze rivers and large pieces of water for any great &s;pace of time.

<P>The All-wi&s;e Creator, when he formed the various tribes of animals, endued them with propen&s;ities adapted to their different natures, and be&s;towed upon each, that power, or capacity, of pur&s;uing the be&s;t means of pre&s;ervation, which we
<PB N="189" REF="036664_0188_100A60D902BDE398">
call in&s;tinct. The influence of this quality is univer|&s;al among&s;t every order of living creatures inferior to man; from the mighty elephant to the mo&s;t minute in&s;ect, its principle is uniform, producing a &s;imilari|ty of action in every individual of the &s;ame &s;pecies. Whole flocks of birds are known to migrate from one country to another, in &s;earch of peculiar kinds of food, or induced by a tran&s;ition of climate more congenial to their exi&s;tence: but the mo&s;t acute phi|lo&s;opher is unable to explain the &s;en&s;ation that teach|es them the proper moment to remove, or the cour&s;e that leads to the exact &s;pot that produces the food they are &s;eeking. Although we cannot account for the many curious facts which re&s;ult from animal in|&s;tinct, it is a &s;ubject which de&s;erves our mo&s;t attentive ob&s;ervation, &s;upplying a never-failing &s;ource of a|mu&s;ement, and leading the mind to acknowledge and adore the wi&s;dom of the Supreme Being, manife&s;ted in his works.</P>

<P>A piece of water, of &s;everal acres, &s;itu|ated in the mid&s;t of retired woods, being cho&s;en, a number of pipes, as they are called, are formed to catch the wild fowl. The&s;e pipes con&s;i&s;t of a ditch, or &s;mall canal, communicating with the pond, and growing narrower from the entrance to the termina|tion; over which is an arch of netting &s;u&s;pended up|on hoops, clo&s;ing at the end of the canal in a funnel net. As the direction of the wild fowl depends upon the wind, a pipe is provided for almo&s;t every point
<PB N="190" REF="036664_0189_100A60DAB252BC78">
of the compa&s;s. Along each pipe are placed, at certain di&s;tances, &s;creens made of reeds, fixed in an oblique direction, &s;o as to completely conceal the de|coy man from the wild fowl, though he contrives to peep at them through &s;mall holes cut in the &s;creens, over which he throws hemp-&s;eed to the decoy ducks, in order to entice them to the farther part of the pipe; the hemp-&s;eed being very light, floats upon the &s;urface of the water, and allures the wild fowl to follow their in&s;idious companions into the &s;nare. The decoy ducks will frequently lead the way up the pipe at the &s;ound of their ma&s;ter's whi&s;tle, and will &s;ome|times dive under water, whil&s;t the unwary &s;trangers fly above, and are taken in the &s;nare. The decoy man is often obliged to make u&s;e of a little dog, when the wild fowl happen to be in &s;uch a &s;leepy, doving &s;tate that they will not follow his ducks; the dog, having been long trained to the employment, plays backwards and forward between the reed-&s;creens, till he attracts the attention of the wild fowl; provoked at the di&s;turbance, they advance without &s;oar, to drive away this contemptible enemy; whil&s;t the dog, by the command of his ma&s;ter, draws nearer and nearer to the end of the pipe, &s;educing his pur&s;uers &s;o far, that their return is prevented by the appearance of the fowler, who comes out from his hiding-place; nor will the nets above them &s;uffer their e&s;cape upwards; pre&s;&s;ed upon all &s;ides, they ru&s;h into the pur&s;e not, and meet their fate. If the dog does not obtain a &s;ufficient degree of attention, he is decorated with a red handkerchief, or &s;omething very &s;hewy, which generally an&s;wers the purpo&s;e.</P>

<P>I &s;uppo&s;e a dog may be taught almo&s;t any thing: the tricks of the dancing dogs have fre|quently amu&s;ed me, and rai&s;ed my a&s;toni&s;hment by their dexterity. My own little Daphne has wonder|ful &s;agacity; &s;he under&s;tands me whenever I &s;peak to her, and begs &s;o prettily when &s;he wants a piece of ginger-bread, that I trifle away many an hour in playing with her.</P>

<P>Time is too precious to be lav|i&s;hed in trifles, minutes are &s;ufficient to be&s;tow upon &s;uch an u&s;ele&s;s employment; but I forbear to be &s;e|vere in my remarks upon this hone&s;t confe&s;&s;ion, be|lieving that you daily improve in the appropriation of your lei&s;ure. The facility with which dogs re|ceive in&s;truction is wonderful, and renders them very beneficial to man, by enabling him to train them properly to the pur&s;uit of many wild creatures, which he could never obtain without their aid. The do|minion given to us over the inferior orders of ani|mals, authori&s;es us to avail our&s;elves of the facul|ties they po&s;&s;e&s;s, that they may become more u&s;eful; but the abu&s;e of that power degenerates into tyranny, when we torment them unnece&s;&s;arily. You admire the grote&s;que attitudes and ready obedience of tho&s;e poor bea&s;ts which are led about, and compelled to a|mu&s;e the unthinking &s;pectators; but you would com|mi&s;erate their &s;ufferings, did you know the cruel di&s;|cipline they have groaned under, for the purpo&s;e of attaining the&s;e ridiculous accompli&s;hments. A per|&s;on of reflection and humanity ought to di&s;courage the tormenting of an inoffen&s;ive hor&s;e, a harmle&s;s pig, or an innocent dog, when there is no other mo|tive for it, but the gratification of &s;eeing either of them pick out the letters that are called for, paw the number of the hour, or dance a hornpipe. They re|ceive their le&s;&s;ons when very young, and they are enforced by deprivation of food, and the influence of the rod placed in the hands of an unfeeling ma&s;ter.</P>

<P>The dun birds are frequently taken in a different manner. It is u&s;ual for the&s;e birds to ri&s;e in va&s;t numbers of an evening after hav|ing repo&s;ed upon the water all day. The decoy man, acquainted with the time of their taking wing, watches the proper moment, and draws a very wide net acro&s;s the pond, which is &s;upported by poles of fifty feet high; the leaders of the flight, impeded in their progre&s;s by the entanglement of the nets, fall back, and ob&s;truct the pa&s;&s;age of tho&s;e that follow them; whil&s;t they, in their turn, do the &s;ame to tho&s;e behind them: confu&s;ion en&s;ues; and being heavy, and unable to ri&s;e again, when once beaten down, they become an ea&s;y prey to the men, who &s;tand on the bank of the pond, prepared to take and de&s;troy them. Their number contributes to their de&s;truc|tion; &s;eventy dozen have been taken by this means in one night: the produce of a &s;ea&s;on is almo&s;t be|yond calculation.</P>

<P>That is practi&s;ed only in the months of July and Augu&s;t, during the moulting &s;ea&s;on, whil&s;t the birds are deprived of their wing feathers, which prevents them from e&s;caping from the &s;paniel, which is well trained to the employment. The nets are &s;et in creeks or narrow places, and the wild fowl being put up by the dog, and unable to fly from him, are driven immediately into them; or, &s;ometimes, the dog &s;eizes them, and brings them un|hurt to the feet of his ma&s;ter. They are taken alive, and yield con&s;iderable profit to the poor inhabitants of fenny countries; though, at that time, they are lean and out of fle&s;h, they pre&s;ently become fat and well-ta&s;ted, by feeding upon liver, barley, &s;calded bran, &amp;c. and are then thought by epicures to have

<P>Has the dun bird any re&s;emblance to the common wild duck?</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>The bird known by that name, is the ferina pochard, called by Ray the red-headed widgeon. It has a lead-coloured bill; the head and neck are of a bright grey colour; the brea&s;t, and part of the back, where it joins the neck, are black; the tail con&s;i&s;ts of twelve &s;hort feathers, of a deep grey; the dogs are lead-coloured, and the in&s;ide of them a bright yellow, tinged with red. The head of the female is of a pale reddi&s;h brown. In the winter &s;ea&s;on, they frequent our fens, and augment the number of delicacies &s;ound in the London mar|kets, forming an article of commerce that enriches three de&s;criptions of per&s;ons; the decoy owner con|&s;igns them, in con&s;iderable numbers, to a whole&s;ale trader, who retails them to the poulterers for the accommodation of his cu&s;tomers. During the cour&s;e of the winter, e&s;pecially if it prove &s;evere, they ad|vance pretty far to the &s;outh, being &s;ound in the neighbourhood of Grand Cairo, in Egypt. They migrate into France towards the end of October, in &s;mall flocks, from twenty to forty, and are al&s;o &s;een in the winter in Carolina. Their flight is rapid and &s;trong, adapted to &s;uch long journies; but the flocks form no regular &s;hape in flying, and they chiefly live upon &s;mall fi&s;h and &s;hells.</P>

<P>The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the&s;e flocks do not rely only upon the demand for the u&s;e of the table, but upon the feathers for their principal gain. Va&s;t numbers, however, are &s;ent annually to London, under the care of drovers, for the &s;upply of the mar|kets. The &s;uperannuated gee&s;e and ganders are got rid of, by mixing them with the others; but, as their fle&s;h is exceedingly tough and rancid, it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that the purcha&s;ers of the&s;e ance&s;tors of &s;o many defendants will be well &s;atisfied with their bargain. They have recour&s;e to the barbarous method of plucking, in order to obtain the feathers, and this operation is performed five times in the year.

<P>Does the tame and the wild goo&s;e belong to the &s;ame &s;pecies?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>They were originally the &s;ame; the influence of dome&s;tication alone has cau&s;ed the tame ones to differ from the parent &s;tock. The grey lag, or wild goo&s;e, is two feet nine inches in length, and five feet in extent. The bill is large and eleva|ted, of a fle&s;h colour, tinged with yellow; the head and neck a&s;h coloured; brea&s;t and belly whiti&s;h, clouded with grey; the back grey al&s;o, and the legs of a fle&s;h colour. This &s;pecies re&s;ides in the fens the whole year, breeds there, and hatches about eight or nine at a brood, which are frequently taken, and brought up tame; their fle&s;h is reckoned higher fla|voured than that of the dome&s;tic goo&s;e. When wild, the goo&s;e lays but once in a year; good keeping will cau&s;e the tame goo&s;e to rear two broods; and if the eggs are taken away in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, &s;he will produce a &s;ufficient number for three. In the management of animals, as in many other in&s;tances, art improves upon nature; the de&s;ign of which is obviou&s;ly to &s;timulate the indu&s;try and ingenuity of man. Al|though, towards, winter, they collect in great flocks, they remain in the fens in all &s;ea&s;ons. On the con|tinent they are migratory, pa&s;&s;ing from one place to another in flocks of &s;everal hundreds, the whole form|ing a triangle, proceeding with the point foremo&s;t, and headed by a conductor, which tiring &s;ooner than the re&s;t, retires behind, and leaves his place to be filled by another; when they journey in &s;mall com|panies, they follow one another in a direct line. It is &s;uppo&s;ed that they are natives of all countries, be|ing found in every part of the globe.</P>

<P>Intere&s;t is the inducement, as you will perceive, when I tell you, that the pens up|on the table are the quills taken from the wing of that bird. Our beds and pillows are &s;tuffed with their feathers, which require a preparation for that purpo&s;e, by drying them well in the &s;un, and when the juices, which would cau&s;e them to rot and putri|fy, are all exhau&s;ted, they are put into bags, and the du&s;t beaten out of them with poles. Feathers form a con&s;iderable article of commerce, even between di&s;tant countries. Elder down, &s;o much valued on account of its lightne&s;s and warmth for quilts and mattre&s;&s;es, is imported into England from Denmark, and grows beneath the feathers, upon the brea&s;t of tho&s;e ducks, that inhabit Hud&s;on's bay, Greenland, Iceland and Norway. Dantzic &s;upplies us with a great quantity of cock and hen feathers. The down of the &s;wan is brought from the &s;ame place, and from its &s;nowy whitene&s;s makes beautiful muffs and tippets. The o&s;trich feathers, u&s;ed at the in&s;tallation of the knights of the garter, are valued at a high price, which I &s;uppo&s;e is cau&s;ed by their &s;carcity. Muffs made of feathers of various kinds are beautiful, warm, and light. Sophia, can you recollect any part of the conver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;ed a few days ago upon the mechani&s;m of feathers, and their peculiar &s;uitablene&s;s as clothing to the inhabitants of the air?</P>

<P>Nothing could be contrived, &s;o well a|dapted to the u&s;e for which they are de&s;igned.

for catching birds, which you had not time to relate.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is with great willingne&s;s I comply with your reque&s;t, &s;ince I am certain your tenderne&s;s and humanity will never permit you to avail your&s;elf of my information, to entrap or de|&s;troy a harmle&s;s bird wantonly. All creatures are given for our u&s;e, and are &s;ubject to our power; it is therefore allowable to kill them for food, or other ne|ce&s;&s;ary purpo&s;es; but the boy who is capable of in|flicting pain without any other motive, than that vile and deba&s;ing one, of beholding the &s;ufferings of the poor victim, is already hardened to a degree, that prepares him for the perpetration of cruelty to|wards his fellow man, when arrived at manhood. Gee&s;e and ducks are caught by various means in dif|ferent countries; it would be tedious to repeat every particular method, as many of them have a great &s;imilarity; but there is one, u&s;ed both in the Ea&s;t and We&s;t-Indies, as well as in China, that is very cu|rious; Charles is acquainted with it, and will &s;ave me the trouble of de&s;cribing it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>The fowler wades into the water up to the chin, and having his head covered with the &s;kin of a dried goard, called a calaba&s;h, approaches the ducks, which, unmindful of this object, &s;uffer him to mix among them, when he takes as many as he plea&s;|es, with the greate&s;t facility, by drawing them by the legs under the water. This method is often practi&s;|ed on the river Ganges, &s;ub&s;tituting the earthen ve&s;|&s;els of the Gentoos in&s;tead of calaba&s;hes: the&s;e ve&s;|&s;els are what the Gentoos boil their rice in, and are called Kutcharee pots; when once they have been u|&s;ed, they look upon them as defiled, and throw them into the river, where they are picked up for the pur|po&s;e I have mentioned.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Chine&s;e prefer tame ducks to wild ones; and, it is &s;aid, hatch great numbers by artificial heat; the eggs being laid in boxes of &s;and, are placed upon a brick hearth, to which is given a proper heat during the time required for hatching

them. The ducklings are fed with the fle&s;h of craw|fi&s;h and crabs, chopped &s;mall and mixed with boiled rice; in about a fortnight, they are put under the care of an old duck, which teaches them to provide for them&s;elves, being fir&s;t habituated to a &s;ampane, or boat, from which the whole flock, often to the number of three or four hundred, thus brought up, go out to feed, and return at command. About the time of cutting the rice, and reaping the crop, the&s;e duck &s;ampanes are commonly &s;een rowing up and down the river, according to the opportunity of pro|curing food, which is found plentifully when the tide ebbs on the rice plantations, which are overflowed at high water. It is &s;urpri&s;ing to &s;ee thou&s;ands of ducks, belonging to different boats, feeding upon the &s;ame &s;pot promi&s;cuou&s;ly, return at a certain &s;ignal to their re&s;pective &s;ampanes, without a &s;ingle &s;tranger being found among&s;t them.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>You do right, Augu&s;ta, to let nothing pa&s;s, which you do not under&s;tand, without a&s;king for an explanation. The catching of &s;mall birds, in the neighbourhood of London, is a trade followed by weavers, and other mechanics, who, dur|ing the months of March and October, exchange the clo&s;e confinement of garrets for a range in the open fields, where they &s;ub&s;i&s;t, for a time, upon the prof|its of this employment. The nets they u&s;e are made to corre&s;pond exactly with each other, and are gen|erally twelve yards long, and two and an half wide; they are con&s;tructed &s;o as to flap over one another with &s;uch velocity, as &s;eldom to di&s;appoint their own|er of his prize, when the pullers are drawn. But all this apparatus would be ineffectual without the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of birds to allure and &s;educe the wild ones into tho&s;e very &s;nares in which they them&s;elves were once
<PB N="201" REF="036664_0200_100A60F4AA73A918">
caught. The emulation for &s;uperiority of &s;ong, which excites the vocal tribes to vie with each other, is the mean u&s;ed to en&s;nare them. The nets being properly laid, and &s;inging birds, in &s;mall cages, pla|ced near them, the flur birds are braced by a &s;ilken &s;tring, tied under their wings round their bodies, and by that confined to a moveable perch fixed within the nets. The office of the&s;e birds is to call others to a conte&s;t with them for excellence; upon the fir&s;t perception of the approach of the wild birds, one of them gives notice to the re&s;t, which produces the &s;ame tumultuous joy and ec&s;tacy among them, as is heard in a pack of hounds upon di&s;covering the &s;cent. The invitation is given by what is called jerks, in the lan|guage of the bird catchers, and is &s;o loud and power|ful as to &s;top the wild birds in their flight, and fa&s;ci|nate them to the very verge of the machinery pre|pared for their de&s;truction. Artificial means are u&s;ed to cau&s;e the&s;e call birds to moult before the natural &s;ea&s;on, which readers their &s;ong more powerful than that of others; but the proce&s;s is cruel, and many die under it, which enhances the value of the &s;urvi|vors to a &s;urpri&s;ing height: four or live guineas have been given for a &s;ingle &s;ong bird. The hens of ev|ery &s;pecies are killed, and &s;old by the dozen for the u&s;e of the table; but the cocks are generally pre|&s;erved for the &s;ake of their &s;ong.</P>

<P>The Orkney I&s;les lie to the north of Scotland; multitudes of the inhabitants &s;ub|&s;i&s;t upon the eggs of the birds which build upon the cliffs of the rocks, during the breeding &s;ea&s;on: but this precarious &s;upport is obtained at the utmo&s;t haz|ard of their lives. The dauntle&s;s fowlers will a&s;cend the cliffs, which are of a tremendous height, and pa&s;s from one to another with amazing dexterity. Some|times

they are lowered from above by a rope, made either with &s;traw, or the bri&s;tles of a hog, which they prefer even to ropes of hemp, becau&s;e it is not &s;o li|able to be cut by the &s;harpne&s;s of the rocks. One man, who &s;tands upon the edge of the precipice, lets down his companion, and holds the rope, depending on his &s;trength alone, which often fails, and the ad|venturer is da&s;hed to pieces, or peri&s;hes in the &s;ea.</P>

<P>The Holm of No&s;s is a va&s;t rock, &s;evered by &s;ome unknown convul&s;ion of nature, from the i&s;land, about &s;ixteen fathoms di&s;tant. It is of the &s;ame &s;tupendous height as the oppo&s;ite preci|pice, with a raging &s;ea between: &s;everal &s;takes have been fixed on the top of the corre&s;ponding cliffs, by &s;ome bold and fortunate adventurer, who mu&s;t have attained the heights by extraordinary dexterity; a rope is fa&s;tened to the&s;e &s;takes on both &s;ides, along which a machine, called a cradle, is contrived to &s;lide; and, by the help of a &s;mall parallel cord, the daring fowler wafts him&s;elf acro&s;s, and returns with his booty.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>The cliffs of the Feroe I&s;lands, which lie in the Northern Ocean, and are &s;ubject to Denmark, are extremely high, and greatly frequent|ed by &s;ea-fowl; the eggs, feathers, and fle&s;h of the&s;e birds are the inducements which tempt the natives to explore the rece&s;&s;es of the&s;e va&s;t precipicies, both from above and below. When they purpo&s;e de&s;cending, they are furni&s;hed with a rope eighty or an hundred fathoms in length. The fowler fa&s;tens one end of this line a|bout his wai&s;t and between his legs, recommends him|&s;elf to the protection of the Almighty, and is lowered down by fix others, who place a piece of timber on the margin of the rock, to pre&s;erve the rope from wearing again&s;t the &s;harp edge. Their dexterity in this dan|gerous employment is almo&s;t incredible to tho&s;e who have never been inured to face &s;uch difficulties. They
<PB N="203" REF="036664_0202_100A60F856935BA0">
will place their feet again&s;t the front of the precipice, and dart &s;ome fathoms from it, with a cool eye &s;ur|vey the places where the birds ne&s;tle, and again &s;hoot into their haunts. Sometimes the fowler will &s;pring from the rock, and with a fowling-net, placed at the end of a &s;taff, catch the old birds as they fly towards their ne&s;ts. When the dreadful ta&s;k is fini&s;hed, he makes a &s;ignal to his friends above, by means of a &s;mall line, fa&s;tened to him for that purpo&s;e, and they pull him up, and &s;hare the hard-earned profit. The feathers are pre&s;erved for exportation; the fle&s;h is partly eaten fre&s;h, but the greater portion is dried for winter provi&s;ion.</P>

<P>At other times they begin their operations from below; the party &s;et out in a boat, and proceed to the ba&s;e of the precipice which they de&s;ign to a&s;cend, when the per&s;on, who is to climb the rock, fa&s;tens a rope about his wai&s;t, and takes with him a pole, with an iron hook fixed at one end of it, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in his progre&s;s. Thus equipped, he climbs, or is thru&s;t by his companions, to the fir&s;t &s;pot where he can gain a firm footing. Here he lowers his rope, and brings up one of the boat's crew; others are hauled up in the &s;ame manner, and each is furni&s;hed with a rope and fowling-&s;taff. Their pro|gre&s;s to the higher regions is continued by the &s;ame means: when arrived to the heights where the birds frequent, they act in pairs; one of them fa&s;tens him|&s;elf to his a&s;&s;ociate's rope, and is let down to the haunts of the birds beneath him; but when the &s;trength of the man above is unequal to the ta&s;k of drawing him up again, he is overpowered, and both inevitably peri&s;h. The boat attends, and receives the booty. The&s;e expeditions often la&s;t &s;everal days: the nights they pa&s;s in the crannies of the rocks.</P>

<P>They are le&s;s valued now than formerly, when hawking was in fa&s;hion; but there was a time when a good hawk, of the Norwegian breed, was e&s;teemed a pre&s;ent worthy of a monarch. The diver&s;ion of hawking, which con&s;i&s;ts in the ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of taking different &s;pecies of wild fowl by means of train|ed hawks, is very ancient, e&s;pecially in Thrace and Britain. The love of this amu&s;ement prevailed among the ancient Britons, and de&s;cended to later times. The Engli&s;h nobility were devoted to it; a nobleman &s;el|dom appeared abroad without his hawk upon his hand; and the force of their example influenced their inferi|ors, all ranks partook of it in a degree; but the enor|mous expence that attended it, confined it principally to the great. In the reign of James the Fir&s;t, Sir Thomas Mon&s;on is &s;aid to have given one thou&s;and pounds for a ca&s;t of hawks. Rigorous laws were im|po&s;ed for the pre&s;ervation of an exclu&s;ive right to this diver&s;ion; as far back as the reign of Edward the Third, it was made felony to, &s;teal a hawk and im+pri&s;onment

<P>Birds of prey, which feed wholly upon other creatures, are not only fierce and &s;avage in di&s;|po&s;ition, but are furni&s;hed with bills hooked at the end, for tearing their victims, and with &s;trong legs, and hooked &s;harp claws to enable them to hold it with a firmer gripe. The bills of crows are &s;traight and &s;trong for picking: in water fowl, that live upon fi&s;h, they are long and pointed, for &s;triking; in others &s;lender and blunt, for &s;earching in the mire; and tho&s;e of the goo&s;e and duck tribe are flat and broad, for gobbling. Tho&s;e birds, that have long legs, have generally a long neck, or it would be im|po&s;&s;ible for them to reach their food from the ground. The power of retracting, bending, or &s;tretching out the neck is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in an eminent degree by birds in general; and among other advantages that re&s;ult from it that of poi&s;ing them&s;elves in an exact equili|brium is none of the lea&s;t. There are a few birds who&s;e wings are too &s;hort to enable them to fly; as the o&s;trich, ca&s;&s;owary, penguin, &amp;c. but they a&s;&s;i&s;t the former in running, and the latter in &s;wimming or diving, &s;erving them as fins. The tail is u&s;ed as a guide or rudder, to direct their cour&s;e through the air; for, as the head turns one way, the tail is inclined to the oppo&s;ite direction. It al&s;o poi&s;es their long necks and pre&s;erves an even balance. Their peculiar abil|ity to &s;u&s;tain them&s;elves, and pur&s;ue long journies through &s;o thin an element as the air, is &s;aid to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a power they enjoy, of enlarging their bulk when they have occa&s;ion. This admirable con|trivance is effected by air ve&s;&s;els, di&s;per&s;ed over vari|ous parts of the body, even to the bones, and com|municating with the lungs. As the&s;e ve&s;&s;els are fill|ed or emptied, the body is contracted or dilated, and con&s;equently rendered heavier or lighter, as the in|clination of the bird requires. Many &s;imilar ob&s;er|vations might be added, but at this moment I do not recollect them.</P>

<P>They are all curious, and adapted with wonderful &s;agacity to the habits and wants of each in&s;tinctive architect.

The larger rapacious kinds make their ne&s;ts of &s;ticks and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ents, but line them with &s;omething &s;oft. Mo&s;t of them chu&s;e &s;olitary places for their re&s;idence, &s;uch as high rocks, ruined towers, &amp;c. a few of them build upon the ground. Parrots, and all birds with two toes forward and two behind, lay their eggs in holes of trees. Crows build in trees. The ne&s;t of the mag|pie, though compo&s;ed of rude materials, is made with exqui&s;ite art, covered with thorns, like defen|&s;ive armour, and only a &s;mall hole left for an entrance. The o&s;trich is celebrated for neglecting her young; &s;he lays her eggs upon the &s;and, and abandons them to chance. The mode and place of building among &s;mall birds vary; &s;ome build in bu&s;hes, others in holes of walls, or upon banks, and &s;ome upon the ground. Swallows make a curious ne&s;t, different from any other. Clay, moi&s;tened with water, is the material they u&s;e. The Chine&s;e eat the ne&s;ts of one of this &s;pecies, which are formed of a glutinous mat|ter, and e&s;teem it a great delicacy. Web-footed fowl

<P>The taylor bird, a native of the Ea&s;t Indies, makes a very extraordinary ne&s;t of that kind; &s;he picks up a dead leaf, and &s;ews it to the &s;ide of one growing upon a tree; her &s;lender bill is the needle, and &s;ome fine fibres her thread. When &s;he has formed this external coat, &s;he lines it with feath|ers, go&s;&s;amer, and down; this fragile habitation is proportioned to its tenant.

<P>Before we &s;eperate, I wi&s;h to draw your attention to the <HI>force of habit,</HI> which, when applied to dexterity, activity, and courage, &s;eems ca|pable of overcoming the very propen&s;ities and pow|ers of nature; as is exemplified in the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the breath among&s;t divers, who can remain a long time under water; the agility of the climbers of rocks exceeds any powers that per&s;ons unaccu&s;tom|ed to the exerci&s;e are acquainted with; and various other employments call forth faculties and capacities that would for ever remain dormant, unle&s;s excited by nece&s;&s;ity, and confirmed by habit. Let us, each one, vigorou&s;ly apply this principle to the practice of virtue, and the &s;ubjection of every improper inclina|tion and propen&s;ity, and we may rationally hope, in time, to attain to an advanced degree of moral per|fection.

<P>The honey bee, for there are many kinds, is divided into three parts, con&s;i&s;ting of the head, the brea&s;t, and the belly, which are united by two ligaments. The eyes are black, and of an ob|long form, guarded by a horny tunicle or covering. The horns, mo&s;tly called antennae, are placed be|tween the eyes, near the middle of the head, and a&s;|&s;i&s;t the in&s;ect in feeling his way, where the eyes are u&s;ele&s;s, for want of light. The jaws open &s;ideways, and, being armed with teeth, &s;erve to remove every thing offen&s;ive or inconvenient that is found in the live. In their wars with each other, they u&s;e their teeth, and the wounds they inflict with them are &s;up|po&s;ed to be fatal. Their long trunk, or probo&s;cis, is of very curious con&s;truction; it enables them to penetrate the in&s;ide of flowers, and extract their deli|cious
<PB N="210" REF="036664_0209_100A610796AB96C0">
juice; it is long and taper, and &s;o pliant and flexible, that it can be contracted and folded up at plea&s;ure. Four &s;trong &s;cales are contrived to pre|&s;erve this valuable member from injury two of which form a &s;heath to it, whil&s;t the whole is inclo&s;ed in the larger pair. From the brea&s;t, which is of a du&s;ky colour and oblong form, proceed two wings, and three legs on each &s;ide. The belly is divided into &s;ix rings, or folds, which, by &s;liding over one another, &s;erve to &s;horten or lengthen the body. Be&s;ides the inte&s;tines, it contains a bag, which is u&s;ed as a re|ceptacle for the honey they collect. The juices of flowers are conveyed into this bag from the probo&s;|cis, through a narrow pipe, which pa&s;&s;es the head and brea&s;t. The legs are fini&s;hed, in every part, with the greate&s;t nicety; the hindermo&s;t ones are hairy, and &s;treaked cro&s;swi&s;e on the in&s;ide. Within the thigh of the working bee is a hollow place, edged with hair, where the bee loads the materials for wax in little pellets, as large as a pepper-corn. Each foot terminates in two hooks, with the points oppo|&s;ite to each other: between the&s;e claws is a little, thin &s;ub&s;tance, which, when unfolded, enables the in&s;ect to fa&s;ten to gla&s;s, or any other highly-poli&s;hed body. The &s;ting is &s;ituated at the extremity of the belly, and is compo&s;ed of two bearded darts, inclo&s;ed in a horny &s;heath, which has an opening near the end, for the pa&s;&s;age of the darts; at the root of the &s;ting is placed a &s;mall bag, filled with a venomous liquor, which is emitted through the &s;heath into the wound made previou&s;ly by the darts. Mr. Derham, who is celebrated for curious micro&s;copical ob&s;ervations, re|lates, that he counted eight beards, like tho&s;e of fi&s;h|hooks, upon each dart in the &s;ting of a wa&s;p; and the &s;ame number may be &s;een, with good gla&s;&s;es, in that of a bee. One of the&s;e darts is rather longer than the other, and pierces the fle&s;h fir&s;t; the other follows in|&s;tantly. They penetrate deeper and deeper, alter|nately, with their beards or hooks, till the whole &s;ting is buried in the fle&s;h, and then the in&s;ertion of the poi&s;onous juice fini&s;hes the proce&s;s. If the per|&s;on,
<PB N="211" REF="036664_0210_100A61093B518FE8">
who is &s;tung, has pre&s;ence of mind to remain &s;till, the bee in&s;tinctively draws the beards clo&s;e to the &s;ides of the darts, and the &s;ting comes out whole; but if the in&s;ect is di&s;turbed, and attempts to with|draw the &s;ting ha&s;tily, the beards prevent its return, and it is generally left in the wound, which increa&s;es the pain, and retards the cure.</P>

<P>The body of the queen bee is longer and larger than that of the re&s;t of the &s;warm. As &s;he &s;eldom leaves the hive, except for the purpo&s;e of &s;ettling a new colony, &s;he has but little occa&s;ion for dexterity in flying; her wings are indeed but ill a|dapted to that exerci&s;e, being &s;hort, and &s;carcely reaching beyond the middle of her body, the hinder part of which is more taper, and terminates &s;harper than the bodies of the other bees. The under part of her belly and her legs are of a brilliant gold col|our. She is the mother of the hive, as well as its &s;overeign, and is followed, wherever &s;he goes, with the mo&s;t dutiful obedience, by her children and &s;ub|jects. A hive cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without a queen, as &s;he is the only female which produces eggs; nor do they ever permit more than one of them to remain alive in the &s;ame hive. If &s;he happens to find a rival, they &s;ight till one is killed, being armed with a powerful &s;ting, which &s;he &s;eldom u&s;es, except in conte&s;ts for empire, or when unu&s;ually provoked. The queen bee is very prolific, laying &s;everal thou&s;and eggs ev|ery &s;ea&s;on: &s;he generally lies concealed in the mo&s;t &s;ecret part of the hive, and is never vi&s;ible, but when &s;he depo&s;its her eggs in tho&s;e combs which are expo&s;ed to view. She is always attended by ten or a dozen of the common bees, which form a kind of retinue; the&s;e courtiers follow their mi&s;tre&s;s with a &s;olemn pace, in her progre&s;s from one cell to anoth|er. She examines, with care, the cell where &s;he in|tends to leave an egg, le&s;t there &s;hould be honey, wax, or any embryo in it. If &s;he find it empty, &s;he fixes a &s;mall white egg to the bottom of it, which is compo&s;ed of a thin membrane, or &s;kin, filled with a whiti&s;h liquor. Should the queen inadvertantly lay more than one egg in the &s;ame cell, her attendants, the working bees, remove the &s;upernumerary one. When a queen dies accidentally, the whole commu|nity de&s;i&s;ts from its accu&s;tomed labour, con&s;umes the &s;tore of honey, and its members fly about their own hive, and others that are near them, at tho&s;e hours when they &s;hould be at re&s;t; they pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e away with

<P>The facility with which he managed them appeared like magic. He found the means of making a &s;warm alight, ju&s;t where he plea&s;ed, in a few moments.

<P>He made u&s;e of words only to deceive the &s;pectators; the magical wand which he u&s;ed, to transfer them from place to place, was the queen bee. He placed all his dependence upon their fidel|ity and attachment to her; for he knew, that where|ever &s;he was carried, the &s;warm would certainly fol|low. Repeated experiments taught him, that after turning up a hive, and tapping it upon the &s;ides and the bottom, the queen immediately appeared, to know the cau&s;e of the alarm, but &s;oon retired again among her people. By &s;eeing her frequently, he learned to di&s;tingui&s;h her at the fir&s;t glance, and practice en|abled him to lay hold of her &s;o tenderly as not to endanger her per&s;on: having thus &s;ecured the queen, he &s;lipped her gently into his left hand, without in|juring her, or enraging her to &s;ting him. Then he replaced the hive, and retained her as his pri&s;oner, till &s;he was mi&s;&s;ed by the bees, who, as &s;oon as they perceived their lo&s;s, took wing with the greate&s;t con|fu&s;ion;
<PB N="214" REF="036664_0213_100A61111C1291B8">
whil&s;t they were &s;eeking their beloved &s;ove|reign, he placed her upon the &s;pot he wi&s;hed them to &s;ettle. The moment &s;he was di&s;covered by a few, they gave notice to the re&s;t, till the joyful news was communicated to the whole tribe, upon which they all a&s;&s;embled round her, and remained a long while in that &s;ituation, as if afraid of being deprived of her again.</P>

<P>This a&s;cendency over them mu&s;t have appeared unaccountable, before the principle was known by which it was obtained; but Mr. White, in his Hi&s;tory of Selborne, mentions an idiot boy, that lived in that village, who acquired an equal command over them, without any knowledge to guide him in his pur&s;uit. He &s;hewed no under&s;tanding up|on other &s;ubjects, and during the winter &s;ea&s;on he would do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e away the chief part of his time in the chimney corner; but as &s;oon as warm weather re|turned, he re&s;umed his only diver&s;ion, which was &s;earching for bees in the fields, or upon &s;unny banks. He would catch them with his bare hands, without fear of their &s;tings; then he would di&s;arm them of their weapons, and &s;uck their bodies for the &s;ake of their honey-bags; nay, &s;o far would he carry his temerity, that he would &s;ometimes fill his bo&s;om, be|tween his &s;hirt and his &s;kin, with a number of them. He would &s;lide into gardens where bees were kept, and, &s;itting down before the &s;tools, would rap with his fingers upon the hives, and &s;o take the bees as they came out. He has been known to overturn hives for the &s;ake of the honey, of which he was im|moderately fond; and, as if his imagintion was im|pre&s;&s;ed by this one object, he had a habit of imita|ting the buzzing of bees with his lips, as he ran a|bout the fields and gardens.</P>

<P>The common drones, though &s;maller than the queen, are larger than the working bees; and in flying make a greater noi&s;e; they have no &s;ting, neither are their probo&s;cis or feet adapted for collecting wax and honey. They are the males, and are found in the hives only at certain periods of the year. Economy impels the working bees to de&s;troy the drones at the approach of winter; they do not even &s;uffer an egg or a maggot of that kind to e&s;cape, but exterminate the whole race, as u&s;ele&s;s, after the &s;ea&s;on for increa&s;ing the young &s;tock is pa&s;t, and they begin to provide a magazine, to &s;upply the &s;warm with food during the cold weather, when no fre&s;h honey can be procured. The working bees are the mo&s;t numerous part of the &s;tate; they have the care of the hive, collect the honey and wax, make and work up the wax, build the cells, feed the young, keep the hive clean, defend it from intruders, and perform every thing nece&s;&s;ary to be done for the ben|efit of the commonwealth. As the labourers are the guardians of the hive, the &s;ting is a requi&s;ite weapon for them to re&s;i&s;t the attacks of their enemies; for there are many lazy, greedy in&s;ects, which will attempt to devour them, as well as their honey.</P>

<SPEAKER>HENRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>You &s;aid, that the working bees de&s;troy|ed the maggots of the drones; do bees undergo the &s;ame changes as &s;ilk-worms?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECILIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>On the third or fourth day after the egg is laid, a worm or maggot is produced, which, when it is grown &s;o large as to touch the oppo&s;ite corner of the cell, coils it&s;elf up into the &s;hape of a &s;emicircle, and floats in a liquid, which &s;u&s;tains it, and promotes its growth. The working bees are ve|ry attentive in &s;upplying the worms with a &s;ufficient quantity of this liquor, which is conjectured, by &s;ome naturali&s;ts, to be a mixture of water with the juices of plants and flowers, collected purpo&s;ely for the nouri&s;hment of the young, whil&s;t in that helple&s;s, tender &s;tate. The working bees continue to feed the worm for about eight days, till one end touches the other in the form of a ring; when it begins to feel
<PB N="216" REF="036664_0215_100A6116C9489A28">
the fir&s;t po&s;ture unea&s;y, it cea&s;es to eat, and unrolls it&s;elf by degrees, thru&s;ting that end forward towards the mouth of the cell, which is to be the head. The ta&s;k of the attendant bees is now changed from that of feeding the worm, to fa&s;tening up the top of the cell with a lid of wax, and cheri&s;hing the brood, and advancing the approaching transformation by their natural heat. In this concealment, the worm pre|pares a web of &s;ilk in the manner of the &s;ilk-worm. This web forms a lining to the cell, and affords a convenient covering for the change of the worm into a nymph or chry&s;alis. In the &s;pace of eighteen or twenty days, the change is effected, and the bee en|deavours to extricate it&s;elf from its dark and narrow pri&s;on, by forcing its way with its teeth through the lid of the cell. One horn appears fir&s;t, then the head, and, at la&s;t, the whole body. This expan&s;ion to life and liberty is &s;ometimes the work of half a day. The bee, when relea&s;ed from its fetters, &s;tands upon the &s;urface of the comb, till it has acquired its natur|al complexion, and a degree of vigour and maturity to enable it to labour. The re&s;t of the bees gather round it in this &s;tate, celebrate its birth, and feed it with honey out of their own mouths. The &s;hell of the chry&s;alis, and the &s;cattered pieces of wax, which are left in the cell, are removed by the working bees; and the receptacle is no &s;ooner cleared from the relies of its former inhabitant, and ready to re|ceive another, but the queen again depo&s;its an egg in it. The hair, which covers the bodies of the young bees, being whiti&s;h, cau&s;es them to have the appearance of a grey colour; but they gradually lo&s;e that hue, and become brown.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>As the eggs, which are de&s;tined to become drones, are to produce larger in&s;ects than tho&s;e of the common bees, &s;o they are laid in cells of more exten&s;ive dimen&s;ions, and their coverings are rai&s;ed convex, like a &s;mall dome, whil&s;t the oth|ers are flat roo&s;ed. Tho&s;e cells, which are intend|ed for the reception of the royal maggots, are built upon a very different model to any of the re&s;t; they
<PB N="217" REF="036664_0216_100A6118548AD5B8">
are of a longi&s;h oblong form, having one end bigger than the other, with their outward &s;urface full of little cavities. They are &s;ometimes fixed in the middle, and at other times in the &s;ide of a comb. Several common cells are &s;acrificed to form a foun|dation and &s;upport to it. As &s;oon as the young queen comes out of her cell, it is de&s;troyed, and the vacan|cy filled up with common cells; but, as the ba&s;e re|mains, the comb is found thicker in that part than in any other. There are apartments prepared in every hive for the rearing of &s;everal queens, le&s;t, by any accident, they &s;hould be deprived of their &s;ove|reign mi&s;tre&s;s, and have none to replace her. When the members of the commonwealth are become too numerous for the extent of their city, by the addition of the young brood, a part of them, conducted by one of the young queens, leaves the parent &s;tate, and &s;eeks a more convenient &s;ituation el&s;ewhere. A new &s;warm is always compo&s;ed of a queen, &s;everal thou&s;and working bees, among which there is a mix|ture of old and young, and &s;ome hundreds of drones. The moment the colony has cho&s;en a new re&s;idence, the labourers begin to work with the utmo&s;t dili|gence, to procure materials for food and building. Apparently con&s;cious that their queen is ready to lay her eggs, they are more anxious to provide cells for her progeny, than for &s;toring of honey. Such is their indu&s;try, that they will form combs twenty inches in length, and proportionably wide, in the &s;pare of a night and a day. If the weather is favourable, they make more wax during the fir&s;t fortnight, than in all the re&s;t of the &s;ea&s;on.</P>

<P>The little knowledge I have, you will be welcome to; and it will give me great plea&s;ure to be your a&s;&s;ociate in this &s;cheme, the plan of which we will arrange hereafter. A hive of bees may, with propriety, he compared to a well-peopled city, in which are commonly found from fifteen to eighteen thou&s;and inhabitants, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting under the mo&s;t per|fect di&s;cipline of wi&s;e laws. The regulation of labour among them is very exact. They are divided into
<PB N="219" REF="036664_0218_100A611BD194E678">
four companies, one of which roves in the fields in &s;earch of materials for building; another is employ|ed in laying out the ba&s;es and partitions of their cells; a third is occupied in poli&s;hing and &s;mooth|ing the in&s;ides of them; and the fourth compa|ny brings food for the re&s;t, or relieves tho&s;e which return oppre&s;&s;ed with their burdens. But the &s;ame bees are not confined con&s;tantly to the &s;ame la|bour. Their ta&s;ks are frequently changed. Tho&s;e which have been engaged in the hive are indulged in making excur&s;ions abroad, whil&s;t tho&s;e which have enjoyed the whole&s;ome fre&s;hne&s;s of the air, &s;ubmit, without reluctance, to confinement within. They ap|pear either to have a language of their own, or to under&s;tand one another by &s;igns. When one of them is in want of food, it bends down its trunk to the bee, from whom it expects a&s;&s;i&s;tance, whil&s;t this la&s;t opens its honey-bag, and &s;uffers &s;ome drops to fall for the needy one, which &s;tands ready to receive it. So ad|mirably is the work di&s;tributed, and &s;o great is their diligence, that in the &s;pace of a day, they are able to build apartments, &s;ufficiently numerous to contain three thou&s;and inhabitants.</P>

<P>The advantage of order and regular ar|rangement is &s;hewn in the policy of this &s;mall in&s;ect. Were the bees guided by no rule, in&s;tead of provid|ing for the accommodation of &s;uch numerous inhab|itants, confu&s;ion a mu&s;t perplex their de&s;igns, and they would interrupt one onother in the progre&s;s of their work, like the builders of the Tower of Babel.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Their &s;agacity in con&s;tructing and di&s;tributing their cells is equally admirable. In their manner of building, the bees have attained three e&s;&s;ential points aimed at by all good architects; the two fir&s;t of which are, the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible economy of room and materials; and the la&s;t is to procure all the accommodation that can be obtained in the &s;pace allowed for the edifice. The form of their cells is a hexagon, or figure of &s;ix equal &s;ides. If you exam|ine it, you will &s;ee, that the circumference of one cell makes part of the circumference of tho&s;e adjoin|ing
<PB N="220" REF="036664_0219_100A611FF4B2E7E0">
to it, which is a &s;aving of the wax, as well as the &s;pace, none o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> which can be lo&s;t, where there is no void between the apartments. The third advantage will be more difficult to your comprehen&s;ion, as it depends upon mathematical knowledge; but tho&s;e who are &s;killed in that &s;cience, tell us, that the hex|agon affords more &s;pace than any other figure that can be joined together. Their frugality induces them to make the partition very thin; but they &s;trength<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the entrance of the cells, which are mo&s;t liable to be injured, by a fillet of wax quite round them, which makes them three or four times thicker than the &s;ides; and the bottom is &s;upported by the junction of three cells exactly beneath the middle of it; for they are careful to place them in &s;uch a man|ner, that the middle of the ba&s;es of one row is di|rectly oppo&s;ite to the angles of the next to it. The combs lie parallel to each other, and there is left be|tween every one of them a &s;pace which &s;erves as a &s;treet, broad enough for two bees to pa&s;s by each other. There are al&s;o holes which go quite through the combs, and may be compared to lanes, for them to pa&s;s from one comb to another, without being obliged to go a great way about.</P>

Some of them, however, have been ob&s;erved to carry pieces of wax in their talons to the place where the others are at work upon the combs, which they fa&s;ten to the work with their feet. Others have been &s;een running about, and beating the work with their wings and their tails, perhaps for the purpo&s;e of hardening it and making it &s;tronger. Whil&s;t &s;ome of the bees are bu&s;ied in building and forming the cells, others are employed in poli&s;hing tho&s;e already

<P>Since I have heard &s;o many curious things about the bees, I have &s;pent all my play time near Cecilia's hives, and ye&s;terday I &s;aw &s;everal bees loaded with little balls of yellow wax &s;ticking to the hollow place in their thighs.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECILIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>The balls, which you ob&s;erved, are not wax, but a powder collected from the &s;tamina of flowers, many of which abound with it; in the lily it is very vi&s;ible, as you mu&s;t have often experienced, if ever you have pulled any of them to pieces.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>HENRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes, I know what you mean; my fin|gers have been covered with it &s;ometimes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECILIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>This powder, or pollen, as it is proper|ly called, does not become wax till it has undergone a proce&s;s in the &s;tomach of the bee. In collecting this &s;ub&s;tance, which is the material that compo&s;es the comb, the bee enters into the cups of flowers, particularly &s;uch as afford the greate&s;t quantity of it. As the in&s;ect's body is covered with hair, it pre|&s;ently gathers a good deal of this du&s;t, by rolling it|&s;elf within the flower; this it bru&s;hes off with its hind legs, and kneads it into balls, which it pu&s;hes in|to tho&s;e two hollow places I mentioned before. In this pur&s;uit, the bee flies from flower to flower, till it has accumulated as much as it can carry, and then returns home with its trea&s;ure. Upon its arrival at the hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, it frequently happens that three or four oth|er bees a&s;&s;i&s;t in relieving it of it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> burden, by each <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ing a &s;hare of the carge. It is not a de&s;ire of food that urges them to &s;wallow this &s;ub&s;tance, but an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">lne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s to provide a &s;upply of real wax for making the combs. At other times, when there is no im<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">culate want of wax, they lay it up in repo&s;i|tories, to &s;erve for the &s;upply of future occa&s;ions. Af|ter having &s;wallowed it for &s;ome time, they have a
<PB N="222" REF="036664_0221_100A612407D39DC8">
method of returning it, when they want it for u&s;e; and it is only when in this &s;oft and pliant &s;tate, that they can apply it properly in the making of combs. It is &s;uppo&s;ed, by the quantities they collect, that a great deal of it is laid up for food. In this &s;tate it is known by the name of bee-bread.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>The crude wax, by which I mean the material which they &s;wallow to make wax, is not always yellow, but varies according to the flowers from which it is gathered. The combs are at fir&s;t white, but are changed to yellow, by the &s;team and impurities ari&s;ing from &s;o many in&s;ects confined in one place. Honey, which is their principal trea&s;|ure, is originally a juice dige&s;ted in plants, which ex|udes through their pores, and exi&s;ts chiefly in their flowers, or in re&s;ervoirs, called honey-cups, of vari|ous forms, and differently &s;ituated in different flow|ers. The bees obtain the honey, either by penetra|ting into the&s;e rece&s;&s;es, or they collect it when expo|&s;ed upon the &s;urface of the flower. This precious &s;poil is carried home in their &s;tomachs; &s;o that, though heavily laden, they appear, to a &s;uperficial ob&s;erver, as if they had procured nothing by their excur&s;ion. Bees are equally fond of another &s;ub|&s;tance, called honey-dew, of which there are two kinds, both being produced upon vegetables, though ari&s;ing from different cau&s;es. The fir&s;t kind, which is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed to be a dew, that falls upon trees, is nothing but a mild, &s;weet juice, which, hav|ing circulated through the ve&s;&s;els of vegetables, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;eparated in re&s;ervoirs in the flowers, or on the leaves, where it is properly called the honey-dew. Some|times it re&s;ides in the pith, as in the &s;ugar-cane; and at others in the juice of pulpy &s;ummer fruits, when ripe. Manna, which is found on the a&s;h and maple trees of Calabria, i&s;&s;uing from their leaves and trunks, is a &s;pecies of honey-dew. The &s;econd kind is pro|duced by a &s;mall in&s;ect, and &s;upplies the bees with a re&s;ource, when the &s;pring flowers are gone, and the dew, which tran&s;pires from the plants is no longer to be obtained.</P>

<P>There is yet another &s;ub&s;tance collected and u&s;ed by bees, but I cannot &s;ay, with any certain|ty, where they procure it; &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e, that they meet with it on the birch, the willow, and the pop|lar. It is a re&s;inous gum of a more gluey quality than wax, and different from it in many re&s;pects. The u&s;e to which they apply it, is to pla&s;ter the in|&s;ide of their hives, and to fill up the mo&s;t minute crannies, that may chance to be in them. It was called by the ancients propolis. When they begin to work with it, it is &s;oft, but in length of time acquires a brown colour, and becomes much harder than wax.</P>

<P>As &s;oon as they reach the hive with a load of honey, they depo&s;it it in an empty cell.

There is, in each cell, a thicker &s;ub|&s;tance, &s;omething like a cream, which is placed over the honey, to prevent it from running out; this gradually ri&s;es as the cell is filled; when it reaches the top, the bees clo&s;e up the cell with a covering of wax, and it remains untouched, till nece&s;&s;ity com|pels them to have recour&s;e to it.</P>

Their in&s;tinct is as ad|mirable in providing for their own &s;afety and well|being in &s;ome other re&s;pects, as in tho&s;e I have al|ready remarked. They defend the hives from the intru&s;ion of other in&s;ects, by gluing up every avenue by which they might gain an entrance; and &s;enti|nels are appointed to watch the mouth of the hive,

Look at the &s;ky, and you will perceive the cau&s;e of all this bu&s;|tle, in the gathering of &s;mall clouds that foretel rain. It is &s;aid, that no bee is ever caught even in a &s;ud|den &s;hower, unle&s;s at a great di&s;tance from home, or in a &s;ick or di&s;abled &s;tate.

<P>Linnaeus enumerates fifty-five; &s;ome of which live in &s;ociety, whil&s;t others dwell and labour in &s;olitude, building cradles for the reception of their infant progeny; as the leaf-cutter bee does with the leaf of the ro&s;e-tree; the uphol&s;terer, with the gau|dy tape&s;try of the corn-ro&s;e; the ma&s;on-bee with a pla&s;ter: and the wood-piercer with &s;aw-du&s;t.

The honey-bee, which has taken up &s;o much of our attention, is, in &s;ome degree, dome&s;ticated, and its manners differ from tho&s;e in a wild &s;tate, as hives are provided by man for it to build its comb in.</P>

<P>The management of bees is an art, which would take up too much of our time to define, but &s;ome ob&s;ervations relative to it, will &s;erve to illu&s;trate what has already been &s;aid. The fir&s;t

care is to chu&s;e a &s;ituation for the apiary, that is nei|ther too much expo&s;ed to the rays of the &s;un, or to the cold. A &s;upply of food is the next con&s;ideration, which greatly depends upon the abundance of tho&s;e plants in the neighbourhood which yield honey in plenty. Thyme, heath, and broom are thought ex|cellent for the purpo&s;e, as well as many others which I &s;hall pa&s;s over. As &s;ome &s;ituations are deficient in this re&s;pect, at certain &s;ea&s;ons, contrivances have been u&s;ed, in countries where bees form an e&s;&s;ential branch of agricultural economy, to remove them from one place to another. In many parts of France, it is not unu&s;ual to &s;ee floating bee-hou&s;es. They will put from &s;ixty to a hundred hives on board one barge, well defended from the injuries that might be occa&s;ioned by an accidental &s;torm. By this convey|ance, they float gently down the river, feeding on the flowery pa&s;tures on its banks, and, by the honey they collect during the voyage, repay their owner for the trouble of removing them.</P>

<P>I read a wonderful account, a little while ago, in the Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, of a bird, found in the interior parts of Africa, called the indi|cator, or honey guide, which directs travellers to the &s;pot where honey is to be found. It is a &s;pecies of cuckow, but much &s;maller than that which fre|quents Europe. Honey being its favourite food, it is prompted by &s;elf intere&s;t to point out the place where the booty is concealed, as it is generally repaid for its intelligence, by a part of the &s;poil. The morn|ing and the evening are the times in which it &s;earches for food, and it is then heard calling, in a &s;hrill tone, cherr, cherr; a note which immediately draws the attention of the honey-hunters, as they con&s;ider it a &s;ignal for the chace. From time to time they an|&s;wer with a &s;oft whi&s;tle, which the bird hearing, continues its note. As &s;oon as it perceives the men, it flutters gradually to the place where the bees are &s;ituated, continually repeating its former call of cherr, cherr: nay, if it &s;hould happen to have advanced con&s;iderably before the hunters, who are very liable to be impeded by bu&s;hes, rivers, &amp;c. it returns to them again, and redoubles its note, as if to &s;timulate them to more activity. At la&s;t the bird is ob&s;erved to hover for a few moments over a particular &s;pot, and then to retire &s;ilently to a neighbouring bu&s;h, or re&s;ting place, and the hunters are &s;ure of finding the bee's ne&s;t in that identical &s;pot; whether it be in a tree, or in the crevice of a rock; or (as is common|ly the ca&s;e) in the earth. Whil&s;t the hunters are bu|&s;y in taking the honey, the bird is &s;een looking on attentively to what is going forward, and waiting for its &s;hare of the &s;poil; the bee-hunters never fail to

<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>The in&s;tinct of this cuckow is ad|mirable, and properly introduced. Wax and honey are the productions which invite men to plunder the &s;tores of the bees. Wax forms a very con&s;iderable article of commerce, the quantity of it con&s;umed in the different parts of Europe being almo&s;t incredi|ble. There are two kinds of it, u&s;ed for different purpo&s;es, white and yellow; the fir&s;t is bleached by art, the la&s;t is as it comes from the hive. After the honey is taken out of the comb, the remaining mat|ter is put into a kettle, with a &s;ufficient quantity of water, then it is melted over a moderate fire, and &s;trained through a linen cloth, by means of a pre&s;s; the &s;cum is taken off before it is cold, and it is pour|ed into moulds made of wood, earthen-ware, or met|al. The bleaching of wax, or rendering it white, is performed by &s;preading it into very thin cakes, and ex|po&s;ing them on linen cloths to the air, both night and day, for the dew is as effectual in whitening it as the &s;un. When they are perfectly blanched by this ex|po&s;ure, they are melted for the la&s;t time, and ca&s;t, with a ladle, upon a table, covered over with little round dents, or cavities, of the &s;ize and form of the cakes of white wax &s;old in the apothecaries' &s;hops. This wax is u&s;ed for candles, torches, tapers, flam|beaux, figures, and other wax works. It is al&s;o an ingredient nece&s;&s;ary in incau&s;tic paintings. Pla&s;ters, cerates, and &s;alves acquire a con&s;i&s;tency by being mixed with it; and, in &s;ome ca&s;es, it is admini&s;tered internally.</P>

<P>Medals, though once current as money, among the ancients, are no longer &s;o in the pre&s;ent times; &s;ome medals have never been u&s;ed for the purpo&s;e of money, but have been &s;truck up|on &s;ome particular occa&s;ion, either to perpetuate the memory of an illu&s;trious action, or to tran&s;mit to po&s;terity the portrait of a great man, as a far more durable means of pre&s;erving his re&s;emblance, than a painting on canva&s;s. The ea&s;e with which a likene&s;s may be multiplied, by an impre&s;&s;ion on metal, is no &s;mall advantage in favour of medals.</P>

<P>The study of medals contributes to illu&s;trate many other branches of knowledge.

<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are few &s;tudies of more import|ance to hi&s;tory, than that of medals. The evidence upon which the veracity of an hi&s;torian mu&s;t re&s;t, is &s;uch corroborating te&s;timony as is manife&s;t to every body, and cannot be fal&s;ified. Public memoirs, in|&s;tructions to amba&s;&s;adors, and other &s;tate papers, confirm the veracity of modern hi&s;tory: &s;uch memo|rials are, however, liable to accidents, and by remain|ing generally in the countries where they were fir&s;t publi&s;hed, are incapable of giving that univer&s;al &s;at|isfaction, that &s;hould authenticate genuine hi&s;tory. Public buildings, in&s;criptions, and &s;tatues, are more durable monuments; but the&s;e are generally obliged, from the nature of things, to remain in particular countries, &s;o that medals alone have the qualities of giving infallible te&s;timony to truth, of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the capacity of being diffu&s;ed over all countries, and of remaining through the late&s;t ages; a&s;certaining dates, and arranging the order of events. Geography &s;ometimes receives light from medals, their in&s;crip|tions

<P>Medals are al&s;o u&s;eful to deter|mine whether the ancients were acquainted with cer|tain animals: tho&s;e which were &s;truck on the cele|bration of the &s;ecular games, pre&s;ent the figures of various animals. On many of the Greek medals are repre&s;entations of &s;everal uncommon plants, as well as animals: tho&s;e of Tyre, in particular, pre&s;erve the form of the &s;hell-fi&s;h, from which the famous purple was procured. The architect receives advantage from the &s;tudy of medals, by the exact delineation of many noble edifices, that no longer exi&s;t, which are &s;een upon &s;ome of them. It is ea&s;y to comprehend their general u&s;e, upon many &s;ubjects connected with a knowledge of ancient events and times. As means of obtaining greater perfection in other branches of &s;cience, they are valuable; but if collected merely as objects of curio&s;ity, they lo&s;e much of their impor|tance.</P>

In a gold coin of Severus, &s;he has the heads of poppies, to expre&s;s, that the greate&s;t bli&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in the forgetfulne&s;s of misfor|tune. Hope is repre&s;ented as a &s;prightly girl walk|ing quickly, and looking &s;traight forward. With

her left hand &s;he holds up her garments, that they may not impede her pace. Whil&s;t in her right hand &s;he di&s;plays the bud of a flower, as an emblem of fu|ture good. Abundance is imaged as a &s;edate mat|ron, &s;cattering fruits out of a cornucopia. Security &s;tands leaning upon a pillar, by which it &s;ignifies her being free from all de&s;igns or pur&s;uits: the po&s;ture in which &s;he appears, corre&s;ponds with her name. A &s;hip &s;ailing before a pro&s;perous breeze, was the &s;ymbol of national happine&s;s. Much ta&s;te and in|genuity are di&s;played in &s;everal others, but I am not able to recollect them.</P>

<P>It was not unu&s;ual to per&s;onify the provinces of the Roman empire on medals, as well as their principal rivers.

The conque&s;t of Af|rica is repre&s;ented, on the rever&s;e, by the metaphor of a crocodile, an animal then &s;uppo&s;ed to be pe|culiar to that country, which is chained to a palm-tree, at once a native of the country, and &s;ymbolic of victory.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well an&s;wered. Money is the general name for that medium which the inhab|itants of different nations have agreed to receive in exchange for commodities; and is an invention &s;o ancient, that the commencement of its u&s;e cannot be a&s;certained. When mankind &s;pread over the face of the earth, and were no longer one family, they were obliged to exchange their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, in order that each one &s;hould obtain a &s;hare of the nece&s;&s;a|ries of life. An example will explain the inconve|nience that re&s;ulted from this plan. I will &s;uppo&s;e that three per&s;ons, A. B. and C. lived in the &s;ame neighbourhood. A. po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an ox, but was in great want of a garment. B. had a coat to &s;pare, but was without a hou&s;e, nor did he know how to build one. C. under&s;tood the con&s;truction of &s;uch hou&s;es as were
<PB N="234" REF="036664_0233_100A613E5A3E23C0">
then in u&s;e, and &s;tood in need of both food and cloath|ing. The&s;e three per&s;ons met, to endeavour to &s;et|tle a bargain, but found it impractible to &s;atisfy the wants of each other by exchange. A. offered his ox to B. for his coat, but he refu&s;ed it, becau&s;e C. would not exert his talent in building, unle&s;s he could ob|tain cloathing as well as food. Charles, tell me by what means this difficulty would have been &s;ettled.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Money would have rendered it ea&s;y; A. in that ca&s;e, might have &s;old his ox, and purcha&s;|ed B.'s coat with part of the price, whil&s;t B. might have recompen&s;ed the ingenuity and indu&s;try of C. with a &s;um that would have enabled him to buy food and raiment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Although &s;everal nations of A|&s;ia, Africa, and America, make u&s;e of &s;hells and fruits as &s;mall money to this day, yet it is rea&s;onable to conclude, that as &s;oon as metals were di&s;covered, they were generally applied to this purpo&s;e, from their &s;uperiority in the qualities of firmne&s;s, neatne&s;s, and durability.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>In rude ages, the money they u&s;ed was con&s;i&s;tent with their manners, rough and unpoli&s;hed, both as to the material and the form. It is &s;uppo&s;ed, that when metal was fir&s;t employed as an in&s;trument of barter, that tho&s;e who intended to pur|cha&s;e goods, carried a ma&s;s of it with them to the place of &s;ale, and provided them&s;elves with in&s;tru|ments to cut off a &s;ufficient quantity for their pur|po&s;e; but they &s;oon felt the nece&s;&s;ity of having the pieces ready cut and weighed. As &s;ociety advanced, fraud obliged the different governments, or rulers of the &s;tates, to affix their &s;tamp upon the&s;e pieces of metal, to &s;hew that they were genuine. Among other &s;ub&s;tances u&s;ed for money in very ancient time, was &s;tamped leather; and, in later periods, nece&s;&s;ity has driven civilized nations to have recour&s;e to &s;ub&s;titutes of very inferior value. The Hollanders coined great quantities of pa&s;teboard, in the year 1574. Iron bars, quenched with vinegar, &s;erved the Lacedemonians for money, and our ance&s;tors, the ancient Britons, u&s;ed plates and rings, made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of iron or tin.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Their form, as well as the im|pre&s;&s;ions upon them, varies in different countries. In Spain they have coins of an irregular figure. In &s;ome parts of the Indies they are &s;quare, and in others of a globular form. The &s;hekel of the Jews was &s;tamp|ed on one &s;ide with the golden pot that held the manna, and on the other with Aaron's rod. The Dardans &s;tamped two cocks fighting. The Athenian coins were marked with an owl or an ox. Tho&s;e of Aegina with a tortoi&s;e. The Romans &s;ometimes im|pre&s;&s;ed theirs with the image of per&s;ons who had been eminent; but this compliment was never ex|tended to the living, till after the fall of the common|wealth, when flattery induced them to &s;tamp their coin on one &s;ide with the head of the reigning em|peror, and &s;ince that time the cu&s;tom has become univer&s;al among civilized nations, that of the Turks and other Mahometans excepted; who, on account of their di&s;approbation of images, in&s;cribe only the name of their prince, with the year of the tran&s;|migration of Mahomet, their prophet.</P>

<P>Guineas were fir&s;t coined in King Charles the Second's reign, and had their name from the gold, of which they were made, being brought from that part of Africa called Guinea. The fir&s;t coinage of &s;hillings was made by Henry the Se|venth, in 1503. Halfpence and farthings were form|erly &s;truck in &s;ilver by Edward the Fir&s;t, in 1280. The coinage of gold was not generally adopted by the &s;tates of Europe before the year 1320, when it was introduced into England by Edward the Third:</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>The profu&s;ion of the precious metals that flowed into Europe from the mines of South-America, reduced their value, and rendered a greater quantity of them requi&s;ite to purcha&s;e the

nece&s;&s;aries of life. Had the Europeans received no other advantages from this di&s;covery, it might have been que&s;tioned, whether it had not produced more evil than good. Agriculture, manufactures, and com|merce, form the true riches of nations; the&s;e are promoted by a due proportion of gold and &s;ilver, u&s;ed as a medium in barter; but corn and wool, and other commodities, are the real &s;ources of wealth to a community.</P>

<P>It is a capital crime to counter|feit the coin of the realm. The privilege of coining is one of the royal prerogatives; but if an individual, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a ma&s;s of either gold or &s;ilver, has an inclination to convert it into money, he may take it to the Tower, where the Briti&s;h coinage is now wholly performed, and it will be returned to him in coin, weight for weight, without incurring any ex|pences. Charles, as I lately carried you to the Mint, which is the office for coining, I expect you will en|tertain us with a recital of the manner in which this art is performed.</P>

<P>After they have taken the laminae, or plates of metal, out of the mould into which they are ca&s;t, they make them pa&s;s and repa&s;s between the &s;everal rollers of the laminating engine, which by being brought gradually clo&s;er to each other, give the plates an even and exact thickne&s;s. The work|man then makes u&s;e of a &s;teel in&s;trument called a tre|pan; it is hollow, and of a roundi&s;h figure, with &s;harp edges, to cut out as many planchets or circu|lar pieces of metal as the plate contains. In order to prepare the&s;e planchets for receiving the de&s;igned im|pre&s;&s;ion, they are compared with &s;tandard pieces, to &s;ee that they are of proper weight; then the &s;uper|fluous part of the metal is filed or &s;craped off; and la&s;tly, they are boiled and made clean, before they
<PB N="237" REF="036664_0236_100A37098553C118">
are conveyed to the machine for marking them upon the edge. The principal pieces of this machine are two laminae, or thin plates of steel, about a line thick. One half of the in&s;cription is engraved on the thick|ne&s;s of one of the laminae, and the other half on the thickne&s;s of the other. The&s;e &s;heets of &s;teel, or la|minae, as they are called, are &s;traight, although the planchets to be marked with them are circular. One of the&s;e laminae is fixed tight with &s;crews, whil&s;t the other &s;lides by means of a dented wheel. When they &s;tamp a planchet, it is placed between the laminae in &s;uch a manner, that the edge of the planchet may touch the two laminae on each &s;ide, and that each of them, as well as the planchet, lies flat upon a cop|per plate, which is fa&s;tened upon a very thick wood|en table. The &s;liding laminae cau&s;es the planchet to turn &s;o, that the edge receives the impre&s;&s;ion, when it has made one turn. Crown and half-crown pieces, only, are thick enough to bear in&s;criptions on their edges. The coining engine, or mill, puts the fini&s;hing &s;troke to the piece. This machine is &s;o com|modious, that a &s;ingle man may &s;tamp twenty thou|&s;and planchets in one day. Gold, &s;ilver, and cop|per, are all of them coined with a mill, to which the coining &s;quares, commonly called dies are fa&s;tened; that of the face beneath, in a &s;quare box fa&s;tened with &s;crews, and the rever&s;e above; in a little box fixed in a &s;imilar manner, the planchet is fixed upon the &s;quare of the effigy, &s;o as to receive an impre&s;&s;ion on both &s;ides, in the twinkling of an eye, by turning the mill once round. Thus completed, the coin un|dergoes an examination of the mint-wardens, who are officers appointed for that purpo&s;e, and then is u&s;her|ed into circulation. I fear my account is &s;carcely clear enough to be under&s;tood, but it is the plaine&s;t I can give you, unle&s;s you could &s;ee the machine.</P>

<P>The &s;ame proce&s;s is ob&s;erved in the coining of medals, but with this difference, that money, requiring but a &s;mall relievo, is perfected at a &s;ingle &s;troke of the engine; but for medals, it is o|bliged
<PB N="238" REF="036664_0237_100A6145619ADC08">
to be repeated &s;everal times for the &s;ake of heightening the relievo; between each &s;troke the planchet is taken out from between the dies, heated, and returned again, &s;ometimes fifteen or twenty times. Medallions, and medals of a high relievo, are frequently ca&s;t fir&s;t in &s;and, becau&s;e of the diffi|culty of giving them a full impre&s;&s;ion in the mill, where they are put only to receive a delicate fini&s;h|ing, which the &s;and &s;eldom gives them.</P>

<P>Until the reign of King William the Third, the Briti&s;h coin was made in a different manner, hammers being u&s;ed in&s;tead of the mill. The method then adopted was le&s;s commodious, not &s;o expeditious, and in every re&s;pect inferior to that now in u&s;e. The perfection of this art has been re|&s;erved for Mr. Boulton of Soho, near Birmingham, where he has con&s;tructed a mo&s;t ingenious apparatus, at a large expence, capable of performing all the dif|ferent operations of coining, as Sophia, who has &s;een it, will explain mere particularly.</P>

<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>The whole machinery is moved by an improved &s;team-engine, which rolls the copper for halfpence finer than copper has ever been rolled for the purpo&s;e of making money; it works both the coupoirs, or &s;crew-pre&s;&s;es, for cutting out the circu|lar pieces of copper, and coins both the faces and edg|es of the money at the &s;ame time, with &s;uch &s;uperi|or excellence and cheapne&s;s of workman&s;hip, as mu&s;t prevent every attempt to imitate the coin in a clan|de&s;tine manner; and con&s;equently may prove a means of &s;aving the lives of many unhappy per&s;ons from the hand of the executioner. By this machine|ry four boys of twelve years old, are capable of &s;trik|ing thirty thou&s;and guineas in an hour, and the ma|chine it&s;elf keeps an unerring account of the number of pieces which are &s;truck.</P>

<HEAD>CONVERSATION XXVI.</HEAD>

<SPEAKER>CECILIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our conver&s;ation upon coins has led me to con&s;ider, that I am extremely ignorant of the nature and properties of metals. I wi&s;h I may be indulged with hearing &s;omething rela|tive to them this evening.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>The &s;ubject you have cho&s;en is ex|ten&s;ive, and is combined with many branches of the arts; but I am willing to oblige you, as far as our time will allow. I &s;uppo&s;e you are acquainted with the names of the metals.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECILIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gold, &s;ilver, copper, iron, tin, and lead.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Gold is the mo&s;t valuable, there|fore we will begin with it. The qualities which give it this &s;uperiority, are purity, ductility, heavine&s;s, and beauty, in which it excels all others. It po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in common with other metals, the properties of being fu&s;ed or melted by fire, and of di&s;tending or &s;pread|ing out under the hammer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard that gold is the heavie&s;t of all bodies.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was believed to be &s;o, till the di&s;covery of a metallic &s;ub&s;tance called platina, which is as ponderous as gold it&s;elf. Gold is more than nineteen times as heavy as its own bulk of water; &s;ilver nearly eleven times; copper between eight and nine times; iron &s;omething more than &s;even, and
<PB N="240" REF="036664_0239_100A614A5CEE24A8">
le&s;s than eight times; lead eleven; and tin but &s;ev|en. By comparing gold with the re&s;t, you will be enabled to judge of its &s;uperior weight. The next quality I &s;hall remark in this valuable metal, is the cohe&s;ion of the particles which compo&s;e it; &s;o firmly do they adhear to each other, that it is extremely dif|ficult to &s;eparate them. A wire of gold, one tenth of an inch in diameter, will &s;upport a weight of five hundred pounds without breaking. From this pro|perty ari&s;es another, which is its ductility, or capaci|ty of being beaten, pre&s;&s;ed, drawn, or &s;tretched out to a &s;urpri&s;ing degree of thinne&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>AUGUSTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is not the leaf gold, we u&s;ed to buy for gilding of pictures, beaten thus?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; the expan&s;ion of the met|al in that proce&s;s is almo&s;t beyond imagination. M. Reaumur a&s;&s;erts, that in an experiment he made, that one grain of gold was extended to rather more than forty-two &s;quare inches of leaf gold; and that an ounce of gold, which, in form of a cube, is not half an inch either high, broad, or long, is beat un|der the hammer into a &s;urface of one hundred and forty-&s;ix and a half &s;quare feet.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HENRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>How a&s;toni&s;hing! Do tell us how this wonderful operation is performed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>A block of black marble, of &s;ev|eral hundred pounds weight, with a &s;quare &s;urface, about nine inches each way, fixed into a wooden frame, &s;erves for a table to beat the gold upon. Three of its &s;ides are guarded by a high ledge, and the front, which is open, has a leather flap fa&s;tened to it, this the gold-beater u&s;es as an apron to pre&s;erve the fragments of gold that fall off. For this pur|po&s;e, the pure&s;t gold is melted in a crucible into in|gots, or pieces of &s;ix or eight inches long, and three quarters of an inch wide. This bar of gold is made red hot, and forged on an anvil into a long plate, which is farther extended, by being pa&s;&s;ed repeated|ly between poli&s;hed &s;teel rollers, till it becomes a riband as thin as paper. This is divided into equal pieces, which are again forged till they are an inch
<PB N="241" REF="036664_0240_100A614D293EDA68">
&s;quare: the&s;e &s;quares are interlaid with leaves of vellum, three or four inches &s;quare: both are con|fined tight with ca&s;es of parchment placed in con|trary directions. The whole is then beaten with the heavie&s;t hammer, till the gold is &s;tretched to the ex|tent of the vellum. In this &s;tate, the &s;heets of gold are then taken out, and cut in four with a &s;teel knife. The&s;e pieces are now inter&s;ected with leaves of the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ne &s;kin of an ox-gut, properly prepared, five inches &s;quare. They are again beaten till they are extend|ed to the &s;ize of the pieces of &s;kin; the &s;ame opera|tions of dividing and beating are repeated the third time. Nothing remains to fini&s;h the proce&s;s, but cut|ting the edges even with a machine adapted to the purpo&s;e, and fixing the leaves of gold in books, the paper of which is well &s;moothed, and rubbed with red bole, that it may not &s;tick to them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I suppo&s;e the gold-beater's &s;kin, which is u&s;ed for healing cuts and &s;cratches, is the &s;ame which you mention to be prepared from the gut of an ox.</P>

<P>You conjecture rightly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Although the di&s;tention of gold is &s;o great under the hammer, it is va&s;tly exceeded by the art of the wire-drawer.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>AUGUSTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;hould have thought that impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are gold leaves not thicker in &s;ome parts than the three hundred and &s;ixty-thou|&s;andth part of an inch; but that is incon&s;iderable when compared with the extreme thinne&s;s of gold &s;pun for laces and embroidery. Gold thread is only &s;ilver wire gilt, or covered with gold. An ingot of &s;ilver, u&s;ually about thirty pounds weight, is rounded into a cylinder, or roll, about an inch and a half in diameter, and twenty-two inches long. Two ounces of gold leaf are &s;ufficient to cover this cylinder; &s;ome|times it is effected with little more than one. But this thin coat of gold mu&s;t be yet va&s;tly thinner. The ingot is repeatedly drawn through the holes of &s;everal irons, each &s;maller than the other, till it be finer than a hair; every new hole dimini&s;hes its thick|ne&s;s; but what it lo&s;es in circumference it gains in
<PB N="242" REF="036664_0241_100A614EAF1690C0">
length, and con&s;equently increa&s;es in &s;urface: yet the gold &s;till covers it, it follows the &s;ilver in all its ex|ten&s;ion, and never leaves the minute&s;t part bare, not even to the micro&s;cope. How inconceivably mu&s;t it be attenuated, when the ingot of &s;ilver is drawn into a thread, the &s;ize of which is nine thou&s;and times le&s;s than it was at fir&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECILIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>This almo&s;t exceeds credibility.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>As inconceivable as it appears, the ingot is not yet extended to its full length. The greate&s;t part of our gold thread is &s;pun, or wound on &s;ilk; and, before they &s;pin it, they flatten it, by pa&s;&s;ing it between two rolls, or wheels of exceed|ingly well poli&s;hed &s;teel, which operation lengthens it one-&s;eventh, and, of cour&s;e, dimini&s;hes its thick|ne&s;s, as well as increa&s;es the exten&s;ion of the gold, which covers it, to &s;uch an exqui&s;ite thinne&s;s that M. Reaumur calculates, that it is reduced to le&s;s than the three millionth part of an inch!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SOPHIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Imagination can &s;carcely follow &s;uch nice calculations. The finene&s;s of the &s;pider's webs, with which we were amu&s;ed &s;ome time ago, is the on|ly thing that I know of, that bears any compari&s;on with it. Gla&s;s, I think po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a capacity al&s;o of being drawn into threads. I remember to have been &s;hewn what they call &s;pun gla&s;s, when I was at the gla&s;s-hou&s;e; it re&s;embled a &s;kein of fine &s;ilk, and formed a pretty ornament for a head-dre&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Several other &s;ub&s;tances po&s;&s;e&s;s a degree of ductility, but very inferior to that of gold. Gums, glues, re&s;ins, and &s;ome other bodies, may when &s;oftened by water, be drawn into threads. Silver we have ju&s;t proved to be ductile; the re&s;t of the metals have this property more or le&s;s. Gold un|dergoes the operation of fire without the &s;malle&s;t di|minution. Platinia and &s;ilver are the only metals be&s;ides, which do not lo&s;e their metallic appearance, and either evaporate in flume, or change into an earthy or gla&s;&s;y form.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>This accounts for a compari&s;on, which I have frequently heard, of virtue re&s;i&s;ting tempta|tion, as gold tried in the fire.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>This power of re&s;i&s;ting the action of fire, peculiar to the&s;e metals, has given them the denomination of perfect, in oppo&s;ition to the re&s;t, which are called imperfect, becau&s;e they are reduced, by being kept long in a fierce fire, to a calx, which you may recollect, is u&s;ed by the enameller.</P>

<P>Are not metals &s;aid to be alloyed, when they are mixed with an inferior kind?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.&mdash;Gold and &s;ilver coins are never &s;truck without an alloy of copper. The &s;oftne&s;s of the&s;e metals is the principal rea&s;on for their being mixed or alloyed, with de&s;ign to render them harder.

<P>Nothing could be &s;o beautiful as gold for &s;uch purpo&s;es; its brightne&s;s, its colour, and cleanline&s;s, to &s;ay nothing of its magnificence, would give it a &s;uperiority to every other metal. Is this precious &s;ub&s;tance peculiar to any one part of the globe?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is found in all the known parts of the earth, though very unequally with re&s;pect to purity and abundance. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable mines in Eu|rope are tho&s;e of the Upper Hungary, and particu|larly that of Chremnitz, America yields the greate&s;t profu&s;ion of gold of any of the four quarters of the world. Peru, Mexico, Chili, and other provinces of the Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies, to which I may add the Brazils, abound with it. When the Spaniards fir&s;t vi&s;ited the&s;e countries, they found a temple, the walls of which were covered with gold.</P>

<P>You have already forgotten what papa remarked upon that &s;ubject, la&s;t night, or you would have been of a different opinion.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>In many parts of A&s;ia, e&s;pecially in Sumatra, Pegu, China, Japan, the Phillippine I&s;l|ands, and Borneo, it is found in con&s;iderable quanti|ties. The coa&s;t, as well as the interior parts of Afri|ca, likewi&s;e produces a great deal of gold.</P>

<P>All gold is not found in mines. I think I have heard, that it is frequently collected from the &s;and and mud of rivers and torrents.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>This happens more frequently in Guinea than el&s;ewhere. There are many European rivers al&s;o which roll particles of gold among their &s;and. Tho&s;e rivers yield the greate&s;t plenty who&s;e cour&s;e is &s;low and uninterrupted, and where the &s;and is of a reddi&s;h or blacki&s;h hue, which, being heavier than the white &s;and, carries the gold along with it to the bottom. Among the rivers in Europe, which produce gold, are the Rhine, the Rhone, the Ga|ronne, the Danube, and the Elbe. The collection of the&s;e &s;cattered grains of this precious metal, af|fords a bare &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to &s;ome of the neighbouring inhabitants.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>AUGUSTA.</SPEAKER>
<P>It mu&s;t be tedious work to pick it from the &s;and.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Experience and ingenuity have invented a more expeditious method than that. The &s;and is received into a long, &s;loping trough, lined at the bottom with flannel, or coar&s;e cloth; upon &s;tirring the water about with the hand, the &s;and is
<PB N="245" REF="036664_0244_100A6156438A6EE0">
wa&s;hed off, and the &s;mall particles of gold &s;ub&s;ide into the wooly matter of the flannel; they are after|wards carefully wa&s;hed out. Gold is &s;ometimes found, in mines, in &s;mall pieces, of different forms and &s;izes, though but &s;eldom in ma&s;&s;es &s;o large as an ounce. At other times, it is dug up in the &s;tony glebes or clods, which are called the mineral, or ore of gold. The&s;e clods generally contain a mixture of other metallic matter, particularly &s;ilver. They are of various colours, and generally lie at lea&s;t one hun|dred and fifty fathoms deep. In order to &s;eparate the&s;e glebes from the gold they contain, they are at fir&s;t broken into &s;mall pieces with iron mallets, and then carried to the mills, to be ground to a very fine powder, which is infu&s;ed, in a &s;olution of common &s;alt, in wooden troughs; it is afterwards refined, from the mixture of foreign &s;ub&s;tances and dro&s;s, by mercury.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mercury, or quick&s;ilver, po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;es the quality of uniting with the other metals in the form of a pa&s;te, which chemi&s;ts call an amalgam. An amalgam of gold may be procured by heating it red hot, and then pouring heated quick&s;ilver upon it. After which the mixture is to be &s;tirred with an iron rod, till it begins to ri&s;e into &s;moke. To fini&s;h the proce&s;s, it is thrown into a ve&s;&s;el full of water, where it hardens, and becomes fit for u&s;e. Gilders and gold&s;miths avail them&s;elves of this means, to render gold more applicable to their purpo&s;es. Suppo&s;e they have occa&s;ion to gild a piece of copper, as the lid of a &s;nuff-box, for example, or any other toy, they cover it with a layer of the amalgam, and then place it in a proper ve&s;&s;el over the fire, the quick&s;ilver evaporates by the heat, and the gold only is left up|on the &s;urface of the copper.</P>

It is as fixed and inde&s;tructible as gold, bearing the action of fire, without a diminu|tion of its weight. It contracts no ru&s;t, but is very apt to tarni&s;h, as you may have often ob&s;erved. It is harder than gold, and if you take the &s;ilver mug, and ring it, you will perceive that it has a &s;ono|rous quality. Charles, I &s;hall not infringe upon your office, of pointing out the countries, who&s;e &s;il|ver mines are the mo&s;t productive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Every quarter of the globe contains &s;ome veins of this metal, nor is our own i&s;land de&s;|titute of it, for although we cannot boa&s;t of any &s;il|ver mines, properly &s;o called, yet &s;everal of our lead-mines yield a con&s;iderable proportion of &s;ilver. It is &s;aid that Sir Hugh Middleton, the projector of bringing the New River from Ware to London, was enabled to pro&s;ecute his u&s;eful de&s;ign, by which a great part of the inhabitants of the metropolis is &s;up|plied with water, from the &s;ilver produced by his lead mines in Wales. The mines of Peru, and oth|er parts of South-America, are much the mo&s;t a|bundant of any known; particularly tho&s;e of Poto&s;i, which continue to repay the labour of the miners, notwith&s;tanding the immen&s;e quantities that have been dug out of them. In&s;tead of finding the ore

near the &s;urface, as they formerly did, the workmen are now obliged to de&s;cend to prodigious depths, in order to obtain it.

The cattle which graze upon the out&s;ide are affected by the pernicious fumes; but &s;o great is their power over the miners within &s;ide, that none of them can re&s;i&s;t their influence above a day together.

<P>Mining is in many re&s;pects a dan|gerous and di&s;agreeable employment, but views of pre&s;ent advantage will induce the ignorant and in|con&s;iderate to undertake any ta&s;k, however objection|able. Silver is found in different &s;tates. It is called virgin, or native &s;ilver, when it occurs naturally al|loyed with copper and gold; but this is but rarely to be met with. When it does happen, it is u&s;ually in fibres, grains, or cry&s;talizations, lying in different &s;ub&s;tances, as flint, &s;par, &s;late, &amp;c. but it is generally found in a mineral &s;tate, by which I mean, united with matter foreign to it&s;elf.

<P>I am glad you have propo&s;ed this que&s;tion, it affords me an opportunity of men|tioning the chemical names of the metals, of which you ought not to be ignorant. From what motive it is difficult to &s;ay, but chemi&s;ts have named each of the metals after one of the planets. Thus gold is called Sol, after the &s;un, perhaps from the brilliancy of its colour. Silver is called Luna, or the moon,
<PB N="250" REF="036664_0249_100A6161B2693278">
to the beams of which its whitene&s;s bears an allu&s;ion, hence the name of this experiment, as Diana was a figurative repre&s;entation of that planet. Copper is Venus, and iron Mars, which is very &s;uitable, as Mars is the god of War. The activity of Mercury is adapted to quick&s;ilver. Tin is called Jupiter, and lead Saturn.</P>

<P>Well remembered, Henry. But to return to the peculiar properties of copper. It is harder than either gold or &s;ilver, and is both mallea|ble and ductile, as it may be drawn into a wire as fine as a hair, or beaten into leaves as thin as tho&s;e of &s;ilver. In a great fire, with free acce&s;s of air, it &s;mokes, lo&s;es part of its weight, (for I &s;uppo&s;e you recollect that it is an imperfect metal) and imparts beautiful green and blue colours to the flame.</P>

It is found in glebes, or &s;tones of various forms and colours; which are fir&s;t beaten &s;mall, and wa&s;hed, to &s;eparate them from the earthy particles with which they are mixed: after wa&s;hing they are &s;melted, and, when in a &s;tate of fu&s;ion, the melted matter is run into a kind of moulds, by which it is formed into large blocks.

<P>You have quite forgotten to mention bra&s;s among the metals.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Bra&s;s is a compo&s;ition of copper, fu&s;ed with lapis calaminaris, by which it is rendered harder, and becomes of a yellow colour. It is rather lighter, harder, and more &s;onorous than pure cop|per, and melts ea&s;ier; but, if heated even a little, is apt to crack and fall in pieces under the hammer, for which rea&s;on it is generally ca&s;t into the form re|quired, and poli&s;hed afterwards. The beauty of its colour, and being le&s;s &s;ubject to ru&s;t than copper, re|commend it for the purpo&s;e of many dome&s;tic uten|&s;ils. A gold colour may be imparted to bra&s;s, by fir&s;t burning it, then di&s;&s;olving it in aqua&s;ortis, and la&s;tly reducing it to its metalline &s;tate: or it may be

<P>It is certain, that it was a me|tallic compo&s;ition of great beauty, and prized but lit|tle below gold: but many doubt the relation of Pli|ny, who &s;ays, that it was a mixture of metals, occa|&s;ioned by the conflagration of Corinth, when that ci|ty was taken by L.

<P>It is compo&s;ed of a due propor|tion of copper and tin. In the metal of which can|non is made, the copper is mixed with various in|gredients of a coar&s;er nature, to make it run clo&s;e and founder well.

<P>As I was pa&s;&s;ing by a copper-&s;mith's, a little while &s;ince, I &s;tood &s;ome time, to ob&s;erve the men at work; they were making large ve&s;&s;els for the purpo&s;e of boilers, to which, they told me copper was particularly adapted, from the ea&s;e with which it could be hammered out to a proper thinne&s;s. There was al&s;o a va&s;t number of &s;heets of copper, prepared for covering the roofs of hou&s;es, and &s;heathing of &s;hips; by this contrivance their holds are defended from worms, and the &s;moothne&s;s of its &s;urface con|tributes to the &s;wiftne&s;s of their &s;ailing.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps we may enlarge upon that topic at &s;ome future opportunity. It is time now to turn our thoughts upon iron, which is the harde&s;t of all metals, and the mo&s;t exten&s;ively u&s;eful of any of them; next to gold, it has the greate&s;t tenacity of parts, or difficulty of being broken, is very
<PB N="253" REF="036664_0252_100A61694665D910">
ela&s;tic, and requires a great degree of heat to put it in a &s;tate of fu&s;ion. The hardne&s;s, brittlene&s;s, and capacity of yielding to the hammer, varies in iron, according to the nature of the ore from which it is obtained, and the operation it has undergone. Ca&s;e iron is that which is run from the ore, and, from a mixture of crude earth, is &s;o hard, as generally to re&s;i&s;t the file or the chi&s;&s;el; it is likewi&s;e brittle and unmalleable in this &s;tate; but is rendered tough by the operation of forging, which is performed by heat|ing it red hot, and then &s;triking it with large ham|mers, which force a quantity of vitreous matter out of it. Steel is only a more perfect kind of iron, pro|duced by fu&s;ing bars of the pure&s;t iron in an earthen crucible, with a cement of charcoal, wood-a&s;hes and different animal &s;ub&s;tances, &s;uch as bones, horns, &s;kins, or hair. The metal, in con&s;equence of this change, acquires a more compact and clo&s;e-grained texture, and becomes harder, more ela&s;tic and tena|cious, as well as more fu&s;ible. Different degrees of ela&s;ticity and brittlene&s;s may be given to &s;teel, ac|cording to the u&s;es for which it is de&s;igned.</P>

<P>Papa's &s;word affords &s;pecimens of both qualities: the fine poli&s;hed handle is very brittle, as he ob&s;erved when he broke it, by hitting it again&s;t a chair, and the blade is &s;o flexible, it will bend al|mo&s;t double without breaking.</P>

<P>It is a &s;pecies of iron ore, which is both hard and heavy; it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es extraordinary powers, attracting iron to it&s;elf, and communicating this property to any piece of iron that is rubbed with it; but what renders it of mo&s;t important advantage in civil life, is a peculiar propen&s;ity which it has of pointing to the poles of the earth; the ingenuity of man has applied this unaccountable quality to the
<PB N="255" REF="036664_0254_100A616D6B616860">
con&s;truction of the compa&s;s, by which &s;hips are guid|ed in their cour&s;e over the trackle&s;s ocean. Iron is the produce of all mountainous countries: the north|ern parts of Europe &s;upply us with great quantities of this mo&s;t u&s;eful metal. The tops of ferruginous mountains are frequently crowned with re&s;inous trees, &s;uch as the pine, the fir, and the cedar, the charcoal of which is particularly adapted to melting the iron. The&s;e trees are often covered with mo&s;&s;es, &s;ome &s;pe|cies of which catch fire from the &s;malle&s;t &s;park. Thus nature has placed tho&s;e materials on the &s;ame &s;pot, which require the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of each other to ren|der them &s;ub&s;ervient to the u&s;es of man.</P>

Tin is of a whiti&s;h colour &s;ofter and le&s;s ela&s;tic than any other metal. The ore of tin is the heavie&s;t of all metallic ores, though tin is the lighte&s;t of metals, which ari&s;es from a com|bination of other &s;ub&s;tances.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Its colour is a little like it. Lead is a coar&s;e, &s;oft, impure metal, but a very u&s;eful one. It is &s;o &s;oft and flexible, that it is ea&s;ily cut with a knife, &s;haved with a plane, grooved for windows, by being drawn through the glazier's vice, or flatted in|to large thin &s;heets, by pa&s;&s;ing it between wooden roll|ers. It has le&s;s malleability than the other metals we have already de&s;cribed; and no capacity of being drawn into wire, which ari&s;es from a want of tena|city. Lead is ea&s;ily fu&s;ed, and melts long before it becomes red hot: as &s;oon as it becomes fluid, it cal|cines, and greyi&s;h a&s;hes are formed upon its &s;urface. When in a middle &s;tate between heat and cold, it is readily formed into &s;mall round grains. Thus &s;hot is made of it, by infu&s;ing a due proportion of yellow orpiment in it, and then pouring it through a plate of copper, bored with holes, of a &s;uitable &s;ize, like a cul|lender, through which the liquid metal pa&s;&s;es, and &s;ub&s;ides in round balls or grains.</P>

<P>Red lead is a preparation of the metal who&s;e name it bears, by calcination, and long expo&s;ure to a &s;trong flame. White lead is formed of its calx, obtained in the fume of vinegar. All acids have the power of di&s;&s;olving it. This la&s;t is of great &s;ervice to the painters, both in oil and water colours. The di&s;covery of a &s;ub&s;titute for it, in hou&s;e-painting e&s;pecially, is much to be de&s;ired, on account of its extremely pernicious qualities to the health of the workmen who u&s;e it.

<P>It is al&s;o &s;ubject to be abu&s;ed, its poi&s;onous quality rendering it highly dangerous to be taken internally, unle&s;s regulated by the judg|ment of a &s;kilful phy&s;ician. Avarice has induced &s;ome unprincipled per&s;ons to infu&s;e &s;alt of lead into wine turned &s;our, with de&s;ign to recover it. Lead is admini&s;tered externally for wounds and ulcers, and Goulard, &s;o much approved for its efficacy in inflammation, is prepared from the extract of lead. Now, Henry, favour us with what you have ob&s;erv|ed upon the &s;ubject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HENRY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hou&s;es are covered with lead; gutters, pipes, and ci&s;terns are made of it; but I do not know how it is formed into &s;heets for the&s;e u&s;es.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Large blocks, called pigs of lead, furni&s;hed from the lead works, are melted by the plumbers into &s;hapes, by running the metal, when liquid, into moulds of bra&s;s, clay, or pla&s;ter. The lead, intended for large &s;heets to cover the roofs of hou&s;es and churches, is melted in a huge cauldron or furnace, and poured with ladles upon a table of exten&s;ive dimen&s;ions, covered with fine &s;and, and guarded with ledges. Pipes are &s;ometimes ca&s;t, at others they are made of a flat piece rolled round, and &s;oldered together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLES.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lead is found in various countries, but it abounds particularly in England. Cornwall, De|von&s;hire, and Somer&s;et&s;hire, yield a con&s;iderable quantity. Non are our mines confined to the We&s;t; Derby&s;hire, Northumberland, and Durham, boa&s;t

of &s;ome which are valuable. Wales likewi&s;e is very productive in this article. So poi&s;onous is the quali|ty of the ore, that in the neighbourhood where it is dug, neither cat, dog, nor fowl can be kept. Sil|ver is mo&s;tly found mixed with it, but often in &s;uch &s;mall proportions as not to repay the expence of &s;ep|arating it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CECILIA.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is the black lead, of which pencils are made, compo&s;ed of that metal?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. HARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>That &s;ub&s;tance, for it is not a metal, is produced in England, particularly in Cum|berland. For the purpo&s;e of making it into pencils, it is &s;awed into &s;lips, and fitted into a grove of &s;ome &s;oft wood, like cedar; and another &s;lip of wood, glu|ed over them. I cannot di&s;mi&s;s our &s;ubject without remarking the abundance and variety of materials which nature offers to her children, as objects for the exerci&s;e of their under&s;tandings and indu&s;try. The globe is covered with vegetation; the ocean a|bounds with trea&s;ure; animals of every order fill the air and inhabit the earth, whil&s;t its bowels conceal the riches of the mine; but to the uncivilized &s;ava<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e the principal part of the&s;e gifts are u&s;ele&s;s. The ex|ertion of the intellectual faculties, application, inge|nuity, and the multiplied wants of refined &s;ociety are requi&s;ite to apply them to beneficial purpo&s;es. The gradations of being, from a polype to a man, are numerous; the di&s;tinctions between a &s;avage and a philo&s;opher are likewi&s;e great, though individuals of the &s;ame &s;pecies. The advantage we enjoy of be|ing born in a &s;tate of civilization, enables us to a&s;|pire to a degree of improvement, characteri&s;tic of the latter. Do not let us be deprived of this &s;uperiority by &s;loth or inattention, but by a daily exertion of the talents be&s;towed upon us, let each of us endeavour to acquire u&s;eful knowledge, which is at once the orna|ment and companion of virtue.</P>
