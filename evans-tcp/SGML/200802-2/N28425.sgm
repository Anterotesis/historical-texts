<P><HI>TO excel in Moral Worth, we must form an ideal Model of Moral Perfection. To assist you, in forming such a Model, has been my constant endeavor. With the same view, I here present you, with a real Model; not as the Standard of Perfection; for that, like the Beauty of Bodies, is not to be discovered in any In|dividual; but as an Exemplar of the happy Combination of many of those Moral Beauties, which constitute the perfect Character. Accept it as a small Testimony of my Affection; and be assured of my ardent Prayers, that you may ever strive not only to equal, but to surpass it.</HI></P>

<P>IS there a &s;pectacle under Heaven, &s;o intere&s;ting to the hu|man heart, as that of a free and numerous people putting on the en&s;igns of mourning, and with one accord, pouring forth their &s;orrows for the lo&s;s, they have &s;u&s;tained in the death of a beloved and honored Fellow-Citizen? Such, is the &s;pec|tacle, which America this day pre&s;ents. Glorious &s;pectacle! Glorious to humanity, which has di&s;played virtues capable of exciting &s;uch univer&s;al, &s;uch heart-felt veneration and love. Glorious to you, citizens of America, who thus honour your|&s;elves by evincing the high value you entertain for exalted merit.&mdash;Great God! On this day, who&s;e ri&s;ing &s;un, we, of late, hailed with joyful acclamations, as u&s;hering in the morn, which gave birth to the illu&s;trious WASHINGTON, but which now, &s;ad emblem of all things human, is &s;et apart to bewail his lo&s;s, and to retrace the energies of his departed &s;oul;&mdash;on this day of woe, permit me to expre&s;s the con&s;olation, which &s;uch a triumph of virtue excites within my heart. I behold a young, but enlightened people te&s;tifying, with one voice, their &s;incere devotion to virtue; I &s;ee the flame of an ardent love for what is truly great and good, bur&s;ting forth from every bo&s;om; I &s;ee a people, but ju&s;t beginning to move in their political orbit, giving the &s;ure&s;t te&s;timony, that the love of virtue per|vades the brea&s;t of every citizen, and that they po&s;&s;e&s;s a force, which will retain them throughout their long career, in the path of &s;ocial felicity, and &s;ocial greatne&s;s. I &s;ee, from this principle, this &s;incere love of virtue, the future glories of my country already to commence. It will be, if pre&s;erved in all its &s;trength, the &s;hield of liberty, the protecting Angel of the republics of this we&s;tern world; it will render them for ever illu&s;trious for patrioti&s;m, for heroic deeds, for arts and for &s;ci|ences. It is thus that they will defy the decrepitude of old age; it is thus, that they will be perpetually renovated in youth; and under the guidance of thy Providence, O God! It is thus, they will &s;hew to the a&s;toni&s;hed world, that the love of virtue has &s;natched from death, amid his dread conque&s;ts, one victory more. May this love be ever cheri&s;hed with a holy zeal! May it ever be the di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tic of Americans, to pay to it the homage, which is due. May this day ever &s;erve to recall the bright example of a WASHINGTON; and
<PB N="5" REF="037876_0004_100F5F60EDA326B8">
to renew, in the hearts of &s;ucceeding generations, that love for virtue which animates the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Ah! My friends and fellow-citizens, I am &s;en&s;ible of the dif|ficulty of addre&s;&s;ing you, upon this mournful occa&s;ion, in a man|ner corre&s;pondent to your feelings. But the love of my country, veneration for tho&s;e rare qualities which dignify and ennoble man, and which diffu&s;e &s;uch ble&s;&s;ings throughout &s;ociety; and above all, the invitations of religion, give to me a momentary confi|dence. Tho&s;e virtues which once animated the heroes of America in the day of battle, now animate the mini&s;ter of reli|gion, of truth and of ju&s;tice.&mdash;It is true, that genius and elo|quence have already exerted their powers in calling to memory the &s;plendid talents, the meritorious actions of the decea&s;ed; and that they have depicted them with a glow of colouring, which I dare not attempt; but, the &s;ubject can never become trite, it can never be exhau&s;ted. Let us then endeavor to re|trace &s;ome of tho&s;e qualities, which di&s;tingui&s;hed our decea&s;ed fellow-citizen, as the hero, the patriot and the &s;age; let us re|view &s;ome of the important &s;cenes through which he pa&s;&s;ed; and let us &s;earch, for the grief we feel in his lo&s;s, a con&s;olati|on in the recital of the wonders of his life. It is a cu&s;tom wor|thy of all free &s;tates, and which the mo&s;t celebrated in antiqui|ty religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved, to be mindful of their ance&s;tors, to ex|tol them with merited panegyricks, and to honor them on &s;uch occa&s;ions as the pre&s;ent; that by doing ju&s;tice to the actions of the dead, they may excite the virtues of the living.</P>
<P>If indeed, the illu&s;trious WASHINGTON, whom all Ameri|ca deplores, and whom the whole civilized world will honor with their eulogies, had obtained only that celebrity, which extraordinary talents in war, in arts and &s;ciences, or in poli|tics confer; if he had not been di&s;tingui&s;hed for his firm adhe|rence to the truths of religion; if he had not &s;erved his God with a zeal worthy of his &s;uperior under&s;tanding, however full of glory he might have been in the eyes of man, religion could not have added her voice to the general plaudit. But religion joins in the univer&s;al woe; &s;he weeps over the tomb of WASHINGTON, great in arms, great in peace, great in piety; and amid&s;t her &s;orrows, feels a gleam of con&s;olation in pro|nouncing his eulogium.</P>
<P>I. With the life of WASHINGTON is connected a new aera in the hi&s;tory of man. He &s;eems to have been called forth by Heaven, as the in&s;trument of e&s;tabli&s;hing principles, funda|mental in &s;ocial happine&s;s, and which mu&s;t and will pervade the civilized world.</P>

When young he was trained to hardihood and to arms; he was educated in the &s;chool of war, and thus prepared for that mighty conflict, which &s;hook the pillars of a di&s;tant throne. The government which nur&s;ed the youthful warrior, nur&s;ed a Samp&s;on, who was one day to break its fetters, and bur&s;t it's cords a&s;under. Virginia &s;aw in her youthful &s;on traits of that character, which was to become the admiration of the world; the morning of his life gave the well founded hope, that the meridian of his day would &s;hine with augmented lu&s;tre, and that his &s;etting &s;un would leave a long tract of glory be|hind.&mdash;Great talents &s;oon manife&s;t them&s;elves by the force with which they take their direction. David, when a youth, &s;ought out the lion and the bear as &s;ubjects for his valour, and voluntarily joined him&s;elf to the armies of I&s;rael to be in&s;truct|ed in the arts of war. WASHINGTON &s;ought out the warrior of the wilderne&s;s, and at an early age, provoked his courage and his &s;tratagems.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">GENERAL WASHINGTON was born on the 22d of February 1732, N. S. When a youth, he was entered a mid&s;hipman, on board a Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;el of war; but relinqui&s;hed his nautical views, in con&s;equence of the entreaties of his friends. Before he attained his twentieth year, he was appointed Adjutant of one of the three di&s;tricts, into which Virginia was then divided, with the rank of Major. In his 21&s;t year, he was &s;ent by Governor Dinwiddie, with plenary powers to examine into the encroch|ments, reported to have been made by the French and Indians, on the Frontiers of Virginia; to treat with the latter, and to warm the former again&s;t future aggre&s;&s;ions. His journal and report to the Governor have been publi&s;hed. The next year, 1754, he was appointed Colonel of a Regiment, rai&s;ed for the defence of the Frontiers&punc; he &s;ignalized him&s;elf at Fort-Nece&s;&s;ity, by a &s;ally, in which he defeated an army much &s;uperi|or to his own. In 1755, he acted as Aid-de-Camp, to General Brad|dock, and attended him in that capacity in the battle, in which he fell. Not an officer, who&s;e duty obliged him to be mounted that day, except Colonel WASHINGTON, e&s;caped death or wounds. The conducting of the retreat devolved upon him; it was effected with a judgment, which acquired him a high reputation, both in Great-Britain, and America. Such was the fatigue he underwent in the day of action, and the &s;uc|ceeding night, that he was obliged, the next morning, to be &s;upported on his hor&s;e with cu&s;hions.&mdash;The government of Virginia, &s;oon after this period, gave him the command of all the troops rai&s;ed, and to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in the Colony.&mdash;He defended the Frontiers, with &s;kill and judg|ment, until the year 58; in this year he commanded the Van-brigade <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> General Forbes, in the capture of Fort Du-Que&s;ne.

undaunted amid &s;uperior foes; &s;aw him, &s;natch from an entire de&s;truction the &s;hattered remnant of a brave, but ill-conducted army.</P>
<P>The fatal battle in which Braddock fell, was only the pre|lude to tho&s;e torrents of blood, which flowed from the conte&s;t of two va&s;t, but rival powers. WASHINGTON, now com|mander of all the forces rai&s;ed in Virginia, continued the ca|reer of military glory, which he had &s;o happily commenced, until his con&s;titution, naturally &s;trong and robu&s;t, became de|bilitated, by ince&s;&s;ant fatigue, and the unu&s;ual hard&s;hip to which he was expo&s;ed. He was thus compelled to retire from the &s;ervice of his country, attended with the &s;incere regret of all his companions in arms. But this retirement was only a preparation for the augu&s;t theatre, upon which he was after|wards to appear. It would be delightful, could we attend him in this retirement; could we here trace out the &s;teps which his philo&s;ophic mind pur&s;ued in the acqui&s;ition of u&s;eful know|ledge. Hitherto Turenne, Malborough and Eugene, had been his preceptors. I know with what ardency in the early &s;tage of his life, he followed them thro' every campaign, retraced their battles, and thus &s;erved under tho&s;e illu&s;trious men. WASHINGTON has often been &s;uppo&s;ed to have made, a Ca|millus, a Fabius or an Emilius his prototype. I believe, that he was him&s;elf de&s;tined to be a high example to mankind, and that the native &s;trength of his own mind &s;oated above imitation; but &s;till it is probable, that his knowledge in tactics was great|ly perfected during this period of retirement, by cultivating an acquaintance with the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed commanders of anti|ent and modern times. Nor can it be doubted, that politics, the true principles of all lawful governments, and e&s;pecially the rights and intere&s;ts of America, often occupied his active and penetrating mind. No one had a firmer hold of the chain of cau&s;es and effects. No one &s;aw with more clearne&s;s, the a&s;toni&s;hing progre&s;s of America, in population and in wealth; or better knew how to e&s;timate the operating cau&s;es. Perhaps his eagle eye &s;aw, that this va&s;t continent could not long revolve round a &s;mall &s;pot in the ocean. But, whatever may have been the pre-&s;entiment of his mind, it is certain, that in this retirement, he cultivated all tho&s;e &s;ocial virtues, which attach man to man, and faithfully di&s;charged tho&s;e duties which a good citizen owes to his country; nor is it le&s;s certain, that he con|tinued, without interruption, the active friend of religion, and at no time forgetful of his God.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="037876_0007_100F5F687826D120">
During this retirement, a blind policy was preparing the way for an event the mo&s;t important in the annals of the world. It is wonderful to con&s;ider, how often the agency of cau&s;es, which men put in motion, produce re&s;ults the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to their intentions, and which baffle all calculation. Ambition forms her plans of &s;ubjugation, and anticipates her triumphs; but, they are controuled by an all wi&s;e and over-ruling Pro|vidence; in&s;tead of oppre&s;&s;ion and mi&s;ery, there often &s;pring forth liberty, &s;ocial order and &s;ocial happine&s;s.</P>
<P>That war, in which WASHINGTON had taken his fir&s;t le&s;|&s;ons in the military art was concluded, in the year '61. The pro&s;perity of the American colonies had continued to flow with a quick current amid all the deva&s;tations of war. The progre&s;s of population, of commerce, of improvement in the mo&s;t u&s;e|full of all arts, agriculture, had received an impul&s;e, which could not be re&s;trained. An enthu&s;ia&s;tic affection for the pa|rent-country had taken deep root. The &s;ons of America had fought and conquered with the armies of Britain. Their feel|ings and their intere&s;ts had been interwoven with new &s;trength during the hour of danger and the triumphs of victory. But the tide of affection did not long continue at the height to which at had ri&s;en. An attempt in '64, to tax America, in a man|ner uncon&s;titutional and incompatible with political liberty, arou&s;ed the vigilance of the colonies.</P>
<P>At this cri&s;is, ob&s;erve, fellow-citizens, Virginia fir&s;t &s;aw the lurking poi&s;on, and fir&s;t dared to propo&s;e the fir&s;t American Congre&s;s that ever met. At her reque&s;t it met at New-York in '65. By the wi&s;dom and the firmne&s;s of that Congre&s;s, the particular mea&s;ure, which had excited &s;uch irritation in Ame|rica, was abandoned. But the abandonment was attended with a declaration, that the right of Britain to bind America by laws and &s;tatutes, was unlimited, or extended to all ca&s;es whatever. An a&s;&s;umption of power, &s;o big with di&s;grace and ruin, was viewed by America with horror and indignation. In vain did rea&s;on and eloquence, on both &s;ides of the Atlantic, demon&s;trate and deplore the calamities, which would en&s;ue from an attempt to enforce this a&s;&s;umed right. It was attempt|ed.&mdash;The patrioti&s;m of Bo&s;ton foiled the attempt, and whelm|ed the in&s;idious bait in the briny deep. Infatuated councils &s;aw not, that an ob&s;tinate per&s;everance in this mad &s;y&s;tem of poli|tical ambition, would give to the world an example the mo&s;t in&s;tructive; an example which would rou&s;e nations from their lethargy, &s;hew to them their own &s;trength, teach them tho&s;e
<PB N="9" REF="037876_0008_100F5F6BF3238998">
primeval rights which men hold only from nature's charter, and awake the &s;pirit to vindicate them.&mdash;Then was the voice of Hen|ry heard. Then was heard the thunder of that eloquence, which &s;hook this continent. His great &s;oul, burning with the concen|tered rays of wi&s;dom and of patrioti&s;m, fir&s;t proclaimed the me|ditated trea&s;on again&s;t the maje&s;ty of the people. Immortal Locke! Thine was the glory to arm the orator with the &s;acred panoply of truth. Nor to him alone were thy energies confined. Thy hallowed page dear to liberty, to virtue, and to religion, &s;hed intellectual light over this we&s;tern world, and taught a le&s;&s;on congenial to the fir&s;t &s;entiments of man. The American mind too, nur&s;ed in the bo&s;om of independence, &s;purned any other controul than that which was founded on legitimate go|vernment. At this eventful cri&s;is, Virginia again &s;tood fore|mo&s;t in the cau&s;e of liberty. Like another Athens watching over the &s;afety of all Greece, and in&s;piring courage by her councils, Virginia fir&s;t propo&s;ed a Congre&s;s of the different &s;tates&mdash;</P>
<P>It met. A dreadful appeal to Heaven drew near. A day of mourning and interce&s;&s;ion was appointed, and ob&s;erved with an awful &s;olemnity. "God! Give the people one heart and one mind, firmly to oppo&s;e every inva&s;ion of American rights," was the prayer then enjoined and addre&s;&s;ed to the throne of grace. In vain were the rea&s;onings and the entreaties of that augu&s;t A&s;&s;embly of &s;tate&s;men, patriots and heroes who were now con&s;ulting for the general intere&s;ts of America, and who &s;o eminently di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves for their moderation, their firmne&s;s and their wi&s;dom. Who&s;e brea&s;t is &s;o callous as not to be touched with the noble &s;entiments, the profound rea&s;on|ing, the manly energetic &s;tyle, the &s;acred ardor in the cau&s;e of liberty which have immortalized their records. They are ex|amples to all generations, and will remain for ever, monuments of human genius and human virtue. Virginia &s;aw that the moment had arrived, when the rights of freemen, Heaven's &s;a|cred gift, were to be yielded or defended with a courage wor|thy of &s;uch a prize. "To die &s;he &s;aid, is common to all, but to die bravely is peculiar to few. Let us not then regard our lives as what properly belongs to us, but by expo&s;ing them for the public cau&s;e, let us acquire a renown which &s;hall be pecu|liar and truly our own. Let us again prove, that an handful of freemen contending for their rights, is more powerful than a ho&s;t, numerous as the &s;ands of the &s;ea, laboring with infamy to infringe them."&mdash;A third time &s;he ro&s;e in all the &s;trength of liberty, and fir&s;t propo&s;ed the declaration of Independence.
<PB N="10" REF="037876_0009_100F5F6D77C3DD18">
Nay, &s;he alone, with a patriotic courage, which a&s;toni&s;hes even at this day, took the bold re&s;olution to &s;ever her&s;elf from Britain, and to meet every danger in defence of her rights. The great council of America, &s;oon &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;imilar deci&s;ion.&mdash;America, be thou Independent; take thy place a|mong the nations of the earth, was the high decree. Nor let it be forgot, that the voice of WASHINGTON, &s;anctioned the decree.&mdash;To arms, to arms, re-echoed throughout the conti|nent. At this awful moment, when the &s;word was to reek with kindred blood, what were the agonizing pangs which wrung every heart!&mdash;Ah! Ye whom the hand of Providence hath &s;till pre&s;erved to this day, ye can tell; ye can recall the memory of times, which tried men's &s;ouls. But the &s;pirit of America, like the daring eagle, mounted as the &s;torm advan|ced, pierced the thick clouds with inbred lightning fraught, and from aloft, beheld the promi&s;ed land of liberty and peace. It was then, America hailed WASHINGTON, as her conduc|tor through the tempe&s;ts of war. Like the cho&s;en leader of the I&s;raelites, repo&s;ing in his God, he obeyed the voice. To him it was ever &s;acred. But what were his feelings at this mo|ment! The &s;ea of troubles through which he mu&s;t pa&s;s, lay before him.&mdash;On one &s;ide, he &s;aw va&s;t &s;uperiority in numbers, wealth unbounded, lu&s;t of domination in&s;atiable, armies inured to war and to conque&s;t, fleets which waved their triumphant banners over the ocean, and which vexed with their prows, the mo&s;t di&s;tant &s;eas; on the other, he &s;aw a people thinly &s;cattered over an exten&s;ive continent, without arms, without funds, without a regular government to concenter their force, without fleets, with no other allies, than their own courage, their virtuous oaths, their love of liberty, and their confidence in the righteou&s;ne&s;s of their cau&s;e.&mdash;But, ardent in the defence of the rights of his country, animated with the true &s;pirit of exalted patrioti&s;m, he emplored the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Heaven, and ha&s;tened to the po&s;t a&s;&s;igned him. Never was there one more perilous. Never was there one, which &s;o called for all tho&s;e great qualities of the &s;oul, which command the admiration of the world. Never was there a tru&s;t repo&s;ed, on which depended i&s;&s;ues &s;o momentous. On the wi&s;dom, the integrity, the pru|dence, the fortitude of one man, hung the de&s;tiny of this wes|tern world. True glory is always mode&s;t and &s;imple. No|thing but the noble principle of obedience to the will of his country, could have induced him, to accept &s;uch a tru&s;t, or to appear as the chief vindicator of American liberty. His mag|nanimity
<PB N="11" REF="037876_0010_100F5F6F01137788">
was no le&s;s evinced by not declining the immen&s;e weight of the office to which he had been called, than his di&s;|intere&s;tedne&s;s was, by a refu&s;al to accept any pecuniary com|pen&s;ation during the war.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had he arrived at the American army, than he diffu&s;ed order through every department. The &s;ame greatne&s;s of &s;oul, which attended him throughout the war, manife&s;ted it|&s;elf in the wi&s;dom of his fir&s;t arrangements, and the mea&s;ures which he took to expel the enemy from Bo&s;ton. Succe&s;s crowned his efforts. But trials, which might have &s;haken the &s;oul of a Jo&s;hua, a Maccabeus, or an Epaminond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s, now await|ed him.&mdash;An ho&s;tile army, the mo&s;t formidable in numbers, in di&s;cipline, in all the apparatus of war, commanded by a Ge|neral, brave, &s;killful and enterpri&s;ing, had landed on our &s;hores. It was now, that the horrors of war were to rage in all their fury, and the plains of America, to be drenched with human blood. Ah! Soon did tho&s;e horrors commence. Misfortune, for a long time, hovered round the banners of America. In vain did patrioti&s;m animate troops half di&s;ciplined, half armed, and inferior in number. From Long-I&s;land, from New-York and through the Jer&s;ies, di&s;comfiture attended the American arms. Yet, amid the&s;e defeats, a courage was di&s;played, which was worthy of the fir&s;t efforts of men &s;truggling in the cau&s;e of humanity. Full many a hoary Father wept the un|timely fate of his gallant &s;on. Full many a widowed matron was left the &s;ad monument of woe. Fathers, Mothers, Wives, ye too, tender babes, who&s;e tongues had ju&s;t learned to li&s;p a Father's name, your virtuous tears flowed not in vain. They plead with Angel eloquence in their country's cau&s;e. Heaven it&s;elf &s;aw and pitied the &s;ufferings, and the impending dangers of America.&mdash;Driven from Long-I&s;land beyond the Delaware, his army reduced to a few brave and faithful com-patriots, de&s;|pondence and di&s;may marked every countenance, except that of WASHINGTON. Superior to events, which &s;eemed more than &s;ufficient to &s;hake the &s;toute&s;t hearts, they &s;erved only to arou&s;e, and to call forth the &s;trength of WASHINGTON's ge|nius. It was in this cri&s;is of weakne&s;s, of de&s;pondency and di&s;may, when the rigour of winter &s;eemed to oppo&s;e in&s;urmoun|table ob&s;tacles, when the &s;pirit of Delaware's angry flood, &s;hrieked loud, and threatened de&s;truction, that WASHINGTON, attended by a few faithful heroes, formed the bold re&s;olution to defy every difficulty, to cro&s;s the enraged flood, to attack the victorious foe, and to &s;natch from him, an Immortal Victory,

in the mid&s;t of his triumphs. The de&s;ign was formed and ex|ecuted with a celerity, a judgment and a fortitude, which was crowned with complete &s;ucce&s;s.&mdash;This was the fir&s;t moment that pre&s;ented the po&s;&s;ibility of victory. It was &s;eized. The bold and gallant achievement a&s;toni&s;hed the enemy, revived the American &s;pirit, and opened the door to &s;till greater enterpri&s;e. Reinforcements &s;ucceeded this fir&s;t vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ry. WASHINGTON, returned to Trenton, where he had ju&s;t acquired &s;o much glory. The active enemy, breathing revenge for their late misfortune, ha&s;ten al&s;o to the &s;ame place, and arrive on the &s;ame evening, with a force greatly &s;uperior. The &s;etting &s;un beheld Trenton containing the two ho&s;tile armies, &s;eparated only by a &s;mall &s;tream. What a cri&s;is! The returning light of the next morn, threatened a period to the hopes of America. De&s;truction or cap|tivity &s;eemed inevitable. Scarce could the brave &s;ons of Ameri|rica refrain from cen&s;uring the ra&s;hne&s;s of their commander. They ca&s;t their eyes upon each other, upon their arms, and upon their country. "The &s;coffs of the conquerors; their haughty looks, when di&s;armed, they &s;hould be led through the ho&s;tile lines," the loath&s;ome jail, or the murderous pri&s;on-&s;hip, all aro&s;e before their eyes. One con&s;olation remained. They could die in defence of their country.&mdash;But the Genius of WASHINGTON, ever invigorated by difficulties, here di&s;play|ed its native force. A &s;ituation &s;o perilous, was to him only the means of acquiring new glory. A retreat would have been ignominious, a battle, fatal. See the event. At the return of day, a moment which his enemy had &s;o anxiou&s;ly anticipated&mdash;WASHINGTON, was a conqueror, on the plains of Prince|ton. He who appeared de&s;tined to certain captivity, was thundering upon his enemy in a di&s;tant quarter, and gain|ing new laurels. I do not &s;ay, that this exploit was worthy of the &s;agacity of an Hannibal, or the wi&s;dom of a Scipio. It was worthy of WASHINGTON; it will be it|&s;elf an example to &s;ucceeding ages, and will forever retain the full verdure of glory. A kind Providence forwarded in an a&s;toni&s;hing manner, an enterprize the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed for that quickne&s;s of penetration, which enables great minds to convert circum&s;tances, apparently the mo&s;t in-au&s;picious, into &s;uch as are mo&s;t favorable. This brilliant victory evinced the deep re&s;ources of WASHINGTO'NS mind, and excited the univer&s;al admiration and applau&s;e of a people who loved and re|vered him; whil&s;t his enemy &s;aw, and had the genero&s;ity to ac|knowledge the pre-eminence of talents, &s;o dangerous to them|&s;elves,

but &s;o invaluable to his country. Can we look back with cold indifference upon events &s;o recent, at which the American heart once rebounded with joy, felt the full debt of gratitude to Heaven, and fervently expre&s;&s;ed that gratitude in prai&s;e and thank&s;giving?&mdash;Can we forget the man, whom Heaven &s;elect|ed as the in&s;trument of its loving kindne&s;s towards us? No! Sooner &s;hall gratitude cea&s;e to be a virtue; &s;ooner &s;hall the love and admiration of heroic deeds, of all tho&s;e exalted talents which give dignity to man, be obliterated from the human brea&s;t.</P>
<P>Thus did a campaign, which in its beginning, threatened un|conditional &s;ubjugation, in it's end, pre&s;ent a pro&s;pect the mo&s;t animating and con&s;olatory to the friends of liberty. The cau&s;e of America had now attracted the attention of the world. Her armies had evinced a &s;pirit worthy of &s;uch a cau&s;e; her enemies had been compelled to retrace their path of victory; whil&s;t WASHINGTON, tranquil in danger, &s;ure in council, &s;uperior in his views and re&s;ources, had acquired the unbounded love, veneration and confidence of his fellow &s;oldiers, had command|ed the re&s;pect of his enemies, and proved that he was worthy of the high tru&s;t committed to him. It was this love, this ve|neration, this confidence, daily increa&s;ing, as his talents and his virtues, were more and more developed which formed the trea&s;ury of America. Yes, ye brave and virtuous defenders of your country, ye companions of the illu&s;trious WASHINGTON, I call you to witne&s;s, that amid all your &s;ufferings, this devo|tion to your chief was your bond of union, your &s;upport, and your reward, whether ye lay contented on the frozen earth, or marked your way by the blood-&s;tained ground on which ye trod, or caught in ha&s;te a &s;canty mor&s;el, &s;till, amid&s;t all your privations, your attachment to your commander, founded on the ju&s;t admiration of his heroic virtues, &s;upported you in every trial, con&s;oled you under every difficulty, and animat|ed you with a patriotic enthu&s;ia&s;m in the day of battle. This command of the affections of brave and virtuous men, this en|tire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heart of every &s;oldier, thisun bounded vene|ration for their chief, whil&s;t it forms the greate&s;t glory of a general, converts each &s;oldier into a hero. He &s;eizes, as an example for him&s;elf, the great model which his general exhi|bits. His temperance, his &s;elf command in the heat of battle, his patience in &s;ufferings, his prudence, his magnanimity, his ardent patrioti&s;m, infu&s;e them&s;elves into every brea&s;t, give an elevation to the mind, a dignity, a confidence, a &s;pirit, which
<PB N="14" REF="037876_0013_100F5F76D54BB0D0">
converts man into a new being, communicates to every power a new energy, and creates a force wonderful and irre&s;i&s;tible. Such was the agency of WASHINGTON's Genius. It po&s;&s;e&s;s|ed a creative power, which a&s;&s;imilated every thing to it&s;elf; or, which called forth in others, talents they felt not before. His very pre&s;ence in&s;pired fortitude. No one approached him, but felt the &s;pirit of heroi&s;m transfu&s;ed into his bo&s;om. I think I &s;ee at this moment, the brave &s;oldier, as he pa&s;&s;es, hail him as his Father, Friend and Champion; I think I &s;ee him, ri&s;e to redeem his country, exult in his martial exerci&s;e, and with a holy fervency calling down ble&s;&s;ings on his commander's honored head, pant again to fight for freedom, or for freedom die.</P>
<P>But if WASHINGTON had hitherto di&s;covered talents won|derfully great in &s;eizing with promtitude, the fir&s;t avenues to &s;ucce&s;s, or of profiting from the &s;malle&s;t inadvertence of a Ge|neral, de&s;ervedly high in military e&s;timation; the time had now arrived, when the caution of a Fabius, or rather, a cauti|on &s;o peculiar to him&s;elf, was to be di&s;played. His inferiority in numbers, and in all the equipments of war, compelled him to take a po&s;ition on the &s;trong grounds of Morri&s;town. It is doubtful whether he manife&s;ted greater talents as a commander, in this &s;ituation, or in tho&s;e &s;cenes of brilliant action which we have ju&s;t mentioned. No one knew better the value of that golden curb, which di&s;cretion hangs on bravery. A ge|neral engagement, which the enemy &s;o ardently &s;olicited, would, in all probability, have extingui&s;hed for ever the bright flame of liberty. To the invading army, procra&s;tination was defeat. In vain did the impetuo&s;ity of the American councils urge him to battle. Nothing could move the &s;oul of WASH|INGTON, but the &s;pirit of wi&s;dom, which ever calm and &s;erene, had determined him now to be content with checking the movements of the enemy, and to maintain a war of caution. It was this caution, &s;o full of prudence and military &s;kill, which, continually baffling the de&s;igns of the enemy, compell|ed them to embark, and to attempt to gain Philadelphia by &s;ea. The attempt forced WASHINGTON from his &s;trong po&s;ts. The battle of Brandy-wine en&s;ued. The value of our troops was un&s;haken, but the event was not fortunate for the Ameri|can arms. There are ca&s;ualties, which human prudence can|not always controul, but upon which, the i&s;&s;ues of battles of|ten depend. One of the&s;e occurred. A fal&s;e intelligence prevented the execution of a de&s;ign, the mo&s;t bold in its
<PB N="15" REF="037876_0014_100F5F79364F2AF0">
nature; but &s;o admirably planned, that had an attempt been made to carry it into effect, victory, and not defeat, would have been the re&s;ult. Nor were the actions of German-town, and of Monmouth le&s;s &s;ignalized for the &s;kill of the general, and the valor of his troops, than for tho&s;e un|toward events which defeated their hopes. WASHINGTON had not always the glory of &s;ucce&s;s; but he had the glory of appearing to de&s;erve it. The wi&s;dom of his mea&s;ures was ne|ver doubted; &s;ucce&s;s, O God! Depends upon thy Providence.</P>
<P>But, Fellow-Citizens, we &s;hould not do ju&s;tice to the ta|lents, or the virtues of WASHINGTON, were we to confine our view to tho&s;e &s;cenes only in which he him&s;elf was the prin|cipal actor. During the progre&s;s of a war, which raged from the frozen walls of Quebec to the burning &s;ands of Savannah, the penetrating eye of WASHINGTON &s;aw every movement; his comprehen&s;ive mind took in the va&s;t whole; his councils were received as the monitions of an oracle; whil&s;t, from his ex|ample, &s;prung up heroes in every quarter. The enemy had &s;oon, every where, if not a WASHINGTON to contend with, at lea&s;t one who gloried in following the exalted model. His knowlege of human nature gave him the command of talents where-ever they appeared; whil&s;t his magnanimity rendered him always the fir&s;t to announce the merit of others, and to participate in their triumphs. Who&s;e bo&s;om glows with the virtuous pride of being a citizen of America, and remembers not the gallantry of Greene, at Red-Bank; or the noble de|fence of Smith at Mud-I&s;land? Who bears not in vivid memo|ry the victors of Saratoga, or him who re&s;cued South-Carolina from the fangs of the lion? Who calls not to mind, the brave, the virtuous, but unfortunate Fayette?&mdash;Thou too, lamented Mercer, &s;halt live immortal in the memory of America. Thy wounds, received in the bloody conte&s;t, which preceded the revolutionary war, had already evinced thy courage and thy patrioti&s;m. Ah! Weltering in thy blood, abandoned in the mid&s;t of the inho&s;pitable wilderne&s;s, the deadly &s;erpent thy on|ly food; what but a kind Providence could have pre&s;erved thee from &s;uch perils! It did pre&s;erve thee, long to live the delight of &s;ociety, and to become the firm vindicator of liberty. Yes, the hand of God, pre&s;erved thee, again to unite thy arms with WASHINGTON, and to pour forth thy gallant, but gentle &s;oul, on the plains of Princeton, covered with glory.</P>
<P>Would time permit, I could here, with that joy, which the love of noble deeds in&s;pires, trace a long line of heroes, who&s;e
<PB N="16" REF="037876_0015_100F5F7AC004B708">
names will be for ever dear to America, and who&s;e energies WASHINGTON &s;aw, combined, and thus produced a force con&s;tant in it's action, and irre&s;i&s;tible in it's effects. Recall the image of this illu&s;trious man; behold him, when not brav|ing the dangers of the field, &s;eated in council, deep deliberati|on engraven on his countenance; &s;ee him giving life and mo|tion to di&s;tant armies, and ince&s;&s;antly directing every thing to the political &s;alvation of his country. He &s;eems another Ar|chimedes, &s;itting on the &s;hore, and moving at plea&s;ure a va&s;t &s;hip, on an ocean to&s;&s;ed with tempe&s;t, whil&s;t he him&s;elf is immoveable.</P>
<P>A ju&s;t eulogium of WASHINGTON requires a detail of the actions of his life. The wonderful properties the inimitable beauties of tho&s;e rays which enlighten and animate all nature to be &s;een in their full lu&s;tre, mu&s;t be viewed &s;eparately. This detail, this &s;eparated view of the luminous actions of WASH|INGTON mu&s;t be left to the judicious and impartial hi&s;torian. The time with which you have already favored me, admo|ni&s;hes me to ha&s;ten to that &s;cene of glory, which &s;till awaited our beloved fellow-citizen, and which by clo&s;ing the bloody drama, e&s;tabli&s;hed, we tru&s;t in God, for ever, pure republican|i&s;m in this we&s;tern world. That la&s;t &s;cene was re&s;erved for Virginia. Her favorite &s;on was de&s;tined, in her bo&s;om, to re|ceive the reward of all his toils; and to fini&s;h in her &s;ight, his career of military glory. I will not open wounds which are but ju&s;t healed, I will not awake the feelings of the friend, the orphan or the parent; nor will I call to mind the accumulated di&s;tre&s;s which mourned throughout this land. Suf|fice it to &s;ay, that a &s;uperior and a gallant foe, the conqueror of India, &s;pread terror and de&s;olation on every &s;ide. WASHING|TON &s;aw the deci&s;ive moment; he &s;aw, that Providence had, at length, pre&s;ented the opportunity of clo&s;ing the &s;ufferings of his country. With a deci&s;ion; a profoundne&s;s of judgment, which a&s;toni&s;hes, he projected and formed with his brave and generous allies, a plan apparently the mo&s;t difficult in its exe|cution, and which, to common apprehen&s;ion, would have in|dicated only the feeblene&s;s of vanity and folly. A powerful enemy in New-York, was to be kept in a &s;tate of alarm, for his &s;afety; allied troops were to be a&s;&s;embled at the &s;ame mo|ment, not only from a di&s;tant quarter on the continent, but from I&s;lands &s;till more remote; a fleet, which gallantly aided in the great de&s;ign, was to &s;econd every movement, and to a&s;|&s;ume it's place at the appointed time; his own troops, by rapid

marches, were to en&s;ure their arrival at the period affixed; the militia of Virginia, provi&s;ions of all kinds, were to be collected. How many powers were here to be combined! What difficul|ty in their arrangement! What prudence in adju&s;ting means &s;o di&s;cordant! What &s;ecrecy in the execution!&mdash;The mind of WASHINGTON was &s;uperior to every difficulty. The ho&s;tile army beheld them&s;elves &s;urrounded by a force, which en&s;ured their captivity, before they &s;u&s;pected the de&s;ign. Nothing more clearly evinces the &s;trength of mind, which this extraordinary man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed than the &s;ure calculation which he had made of the re&s;ult of all his mea&s;ures, and al&s;o, of the con&s;equences which would attend the &s;ucce&s;s of this bold, but well concerted enter|prize. Weak minds, ever vacillating, find their emblem in the A&s;pin's leaf. They have no center of repo&s;e. That of WASHINGTON was &s;elf-poi&s;ed; it felt its own weight, and re&s;ted upon its own determinations. The Admiral of the allied forces he&s;itated, whether he &s;hould keep the &s;tation a&s;|&s;igned to him. America &s;hould often review the letter, which WASHINGTON wrote to him from this city. Hear it fellow citizens. "I am unable to de&s;cribe the painful anxiety under which I have laboured, &s;ince the reception of your letter. It obliges me <HI>warmly</HI> to urge a per&s;everance in the plan agreed upon. The attempt upon York, under the protection of your &s;hipping, is as certain of &s;ucce&s;s, as a &s;uperior force, and a &s;u|periority of mea&s;ures can render any military operation. The capture of the Briti&s;h army is a matter &s;o important in it&s;elf, and <HI>in it's con&s;equences,</HI> that it mu&s;t greatly tend to put an end to the war." After pointing out the certain and fatal event, which would follow the removal of the allied fleet, he adds: "I earne&s;tly beg your Excellency to con&s;ider, that if by moving your fleet from the &s;ituation agreed upon, we lo&s;e the pre&s;ent opportunity, we &s;hall never hereafter have it in our power to &s;trike &s;o deci&s;ive a blow, and the period of an honorable peace will be farther di&s;tant than ever." He then a&s;&s;ures the Admi|ral, that he had nothing to fear from the fleet of the enemy, however &s;uperior, &s;tationed as he was; and then concludes: "I am to pre&s;s your Excellency to per&s;evere in the &s;cheme &s;o happily concerted between us."&mdash;This letter was the anchor of victory. WASHINGTON, with his brave allies, advanced to York. They came, they &s;aw, they conquered.</P>
<P>Then did America exclaim, "If God be for us, who can be again&s;t us." Yes, Great God, then was thy providential kind|ne&s;s manife&s;ted; then was it felt and adored by all; but by none
<PB N="18" REF="037876_0017_100F28AB707964B0">
with more ardor, or more humility, than by him, who had been &s;elected as the chief in&s;trument in thy hands, for the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of liberty in this new world. "Let &s;aid he, Divine Service be performed to morrow, in the different Brigades and Divi&s;ions. The Commander in Chief recommends, that all the troops, which are not upon duty, do a&s;&s;i&s;t at it with a &s;erious deportment, and <HI>that &s;en&s;ibility of heart, which the recollection of the &s;urpri&s;ing and particular interpo&s;ition of providence in our favor claims."</HI> His thanks are then tendered to the whole army, in the warme&s;t language; and let it be remembered, that the mi|litia of Virginia, with their Governor and General, the virtu|ous and the patriotic Nel&s;on, received, in a particular manner, his &s;incere acknowledgments of their brave and zealous co-ope|ration.</P>
<P>Joy, like the rapid lightning, ran from one extremity of the continent to the other. Every hou&s;e of public wor&s;hip re&s;ound|ed with grateful prai&s;es and thank&s;givings to the God of battles. Every heart called for ble&s;&s;ings on the head of WASHING|TON. Every American now began to hail the glorious con&s;um|mation of all his hopes. The vindicators of liberty now &s;aw, that the &s;torm which had &s;o long de&s;olated their country, and deluged it with blood, was rapidly &s;ub&s;iding; the horizon be|gan to gleam around, and promi&s;ed the &s;peedy effulgence of the brighte&s;t day, which ever illuminated this earth.</P>
<P>That day &s;oon arrived. It was the day which witne&s;&s;ed the acknowledgment of the Freedom, the Sovereignty, and the Independence, of the different &s;tates of America.</P>
<P>Is the orb of WASHINGTON's glory now full? No! It is increa&s;ing in &s;plendor.

He was now to give another example to &s;ucceeding ages, another proof of the reality, and the greatne&s;s of his virtues. By his prudence, he fir&s;t drew off &s;ilently the wrath of military tumult; it was an angry cloud, which might have been terrific to this country, had not WASHINGTON, like the immortal Franklin, known how to avert it's fury. No &s;ooner had the veterans of America, unrecompen&s;ed as they were for all their labours and their &s;ufferings, re&s;umed the cha|racter of citizens, than their beloved commander repaired to

"Happy, &s;aid he, in the confirmation of our Independence and Sovereignty, and plea&s;ed with the opportunity afforded the United States, of becoming a re&s;pectable nation, I re&s;ign with &s;atisfaction the appointment I accepted with diffidence, a diffi|dence in my abilities to accompli&s;h &s;o arduous a ta&s;k; which however was &s;uper&s;eded by a confidence in the rectitude of our cau&s;e, the &s;upport of the Supreme power in the union, and the patrionage of Heaven."</P>

He concludes with &s;aying, "I con&s;ider it as an in|di&s;pen&s;ible duty to clo&s;e this la&s;t act of my official life, by com|mending the intere&s;ts of our dear country to the protection of Almighty God, and tho&s;e who have the &s;uperintendence of them, to his Holy keeping.

<P>The thou&s;and emotions, which crowded upon the minds of all pre&s;ent, rendered the &s;cene awfully impre&s;&s;ive.

Hitherto, Fellow-Citizens, you have admired the departed, but immortal WASHINGTON, as a commander. Follow his &s;teps &s;till further, and you will equally admire him as the &s;tates|man and the &s;age.</P>
<P>II. When the intere&s;ts of America indicated a clo&s;er union of tho&s;e &s;overeignties, which the revolution had e&s;tabli&s;hed, Virginia, ever watchful over the general pro&s;perity, and faith|ful to her principles, again &s;tood foremo&s;t. This is the fourth time, that &s;he fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted to her equals, the adoption of mea|&s;ures, which were e&s;&s;ential to the liberties, the pro&s;perity, and the aggrandizement of all. Great God! We thank thee, that rea&s;on, and not arms, is the force which hath hitherto directed the political movements of a virtuous and enlightened people. The general council which was propo&s;ed, met. WASHING|TON was again called into the &s;ervice of his country, and una|nimou&s;ly elected Pre&s;ident of an a&s;&s;embly of men, illu&s;trious for their talents and their patrioti&s;m. From this a&s;&s;embly, eman|ed the pre&s;ent con&s;titution of the Federal Government. He who never &s;olicited and office, was &s;olicited by all America, to accept the important office of Pre&s;ident of the United States. With what diffidence he received this te&s;timony of the confi|dence, the love and the veneration of a free and independent people, is in the memory of every one; nor is the exultation, which &s;pread, like the break of morning light, le&s;s &s;trongly re|collected. To &s;ee WASHINGTON again at the head of the American people, no longer clad in armour, but &s;eated in the curule chair, giving energy to the laws of the Union, and &s;tability to the liberty he had vindicated, watching over the intere&s;ts of all, harmonizing di&s;cordant &s;tates, e&s;tabli&s;hing order and method in every department, and thus making a fair but grand experiment of the &s;ub&s;erviency of the newly created go|vernment to the general happine&s;s, was a &s;pectacle the mo&s;t dignified, as well as the mo&s;t grateful to every heart. With what a&s;&s;iduity he devoted him&s;elf to the duties of his office; with what con&s;ummate prudence and judgment, he directed the legi|timate powers entru&s;ted to him, to their proper ends, let the voice of his country declare. Let the policy pur&s;ued, whil&s;t Europe, maddening with contention, was convul&s;ed to her centre; and whil&s;t conflicting nations were laboring to plunge this country into the whirlpool of war, te&s;tify the wi&s;|dom, the magninimity and the patrioti&s;m of its conductor.&mdash;Peace with all nations, clo&s;e connections with none, union among our&s;elves, mea&s;ures favorable to commercial intercour&s;e,

both internal and external, a militia properly organized, not exten&s;ive military e&s;tabli&s;hments, in&s;titutions to develope and to extend the powers of the intellect, and to diffu&s;e knowledge; The&s;e were the objects which engaged his attention, and form|ed the ba&s;is of his policy. During his admini&s;tration, it is true, that parties, the concomitants of all free governments, aro&s;e. WASHINGTON too had his party; it was that of the public good. He was the chief magi&s;trate of a whole nation, and not of a part of that nation. Onward he bent his &s;teady cour&s;e, inflexible in the pur&s;uit of what he deemed ju&s;t and proper, con&s;cious of his own integrity, relying upon the favour of Hea|ven, and affording an example of that rare a&s;&s;emblage, or rather con&s;tellation of virtues, which will and mu&s;t be the admiration of ages.</P>
<P>Was then WASHINGTON exempt from error? This I do not &s;ay. He was a man; and con&s;equently had the infirmities of man. But this I do believe, and think the whole tenor of his life ju&s;tifies the belief; that, if he did err, his errors were never intentional. Human wi&s;dom, and human virtue claim no higher prerogative. To Heaven only infalibility belongs. But tho' WASHINGTON may have erred, he had the merit of extracting glory even from his errors. How worthy of a great &s;oul are the following &s;entiments, which he delivers in his la&s;t Addre&s;s? <Q>Tho', &s;ays he, in reviewing the incidents of my admini&s;tration, I am uncon&s;cious of intentional error: I am neverthele&s;s too &s;en&s;ible of my defects, not to think it proba|ble, that I may have committed many errors. Whatever they may be, I &s;ervently be&s;eech the Almighty to avert or mitigate the evils to which they may tend. I &s;hall al&s;o carry with me the hope, that my country will never cea&s;e to view them with indulgence; and that forty-five years of my life having been dedicated to its &s;ervice, with an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be con&s;igned to oblivion, as my|&s;elf mu&s;t &s;oon be to the man&s;ions of re&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>Twice called to the pre&s;idential office, his Fellow-Citizens waited only for the return of that day, on which they &s;hould exerci&s;e the &s;overeign right of election, again to clothe him with the &s;ame honors. But, more anxious to enjoy the rights of a private citizen than the honors of office, wearied too with the long and laborious &s;ervice, which had con&s;tantly occupied his mind, and de&s;irous to &s;pend the evening of his day in dome&s;tic tranquility, he announced his intention of retiring. He did not however forget, that he &s;till owed to his country an important
<PB N="22" REF="037876_0021_100F5F89BA91ED50">
duty. This was di&s;charged by an addre&s;s worthy of WASH|INGTON. It contains the outlines of the policy he pur&s;ued, when in office, and which I have attempted &s;lightly to &s;ketch. It contains al&s;o, admonitions the mo&s;t wi&s;e, founded on long experience and deep reflection; admonitions, which ought to be indelibly imprinted upon the mind of every American. It is the advice of the father of American liberty, no le&s;s illu&s;trious, as a &s;tate&s;man and a &s;age, than as a commander in war. America, hear this &s;entence. "Of all the di&s;po&s;itions and habits, which tend to political pro&s;perity, religion and morality are indi&s;pen|&s;ible &s;upports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of pa|trioti&s;m, who &s;hould labor to &s;ubvert tho&s;e great pillars of hu|man happine&s;s, tho&s;e firme&s;t props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician ought to re&s;pect and cheri&s;h them. A volume could not trace their connection with private and public felicity." The mind of WASHINGTON &s;aw, that re|publicani&s;m without morality was a chimera; and that morality without religion was as evane&s;cent as the ba&s;ele&s;s fabric of a vi|&s;ion; he &s;aw, that the morality, the virtue which republics require, mu&s;t have its utmo&s;t link fa&s;tened to the foot&s;tool of the throne of God.&mdash;May the hearts of all be open to this great truth! When WASHINGTON becomes a preacher, who will not li&s;ten. O! Ye who love your country, and labour for the pre&s;ervation of her liberties; ye too, who &s;urrendering your|&s;elves to your pa&s;&s;ions, have &s;acrificed your judgments to your zeal, come to this pure fountain of rea&s;on; it will quench your animo&s;ities; look into it as it flows, it will be a mirror to &s;hew you the path to public good; it will reflect the bright image of that eternal ju&s;tice, which ought to rule the univer&s;e. Yes, Fellow-Citizens, it is by the ob&s;ervance of principles contained in this la&s;t addre&s;s, that the happine&s;s of the people, in the&s;e &s;tates, under the au&s;pices of liberty, will be complete; and <HI>that</HI> free Con&s;titution, the work of their own hands, will be &s;o &s;acredly maintained and pre&s;erved, I u&s;e the words of WASH|INGTON, as will acquire to them the glory of recommending it to the applau&s;e, the affection and the adoption of every nation which is yet a &s;tranger to it.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON retired; but he carried along with him, the &s;entiments which a dutiful citizen ever owes to his country. Impending dangers, during, this retirement, alarmed America. WASHINGTON was again ready to protect her with his &s;hield, and old as he was, to lead her armies to the field of battle.</P>

III. But, that we may do ju&s;tice to WASHINGTON, as a &s;age, and the truly good man, we mu&s;t view him al&s;o in pri|vate life. When man is placed upon an elevated theatre, the eyes of the world, the glory of &s;ucce&s;s, give to his &s;oul a force, and a grandeur, which is often foreign to it. Pride borrows the &s;entiments of virtue; we do not &s;ee the per&s;on, but the per&s;onage. How many have acted as heroes at the head of ar|mies, or appeared more than men, when con&s;cious that they attracted univer&s;al attention; and yet in the &s;hade of retire|ment, in their common intercour&s;e with &s;ociety, have &s;hewn that they were le&s;s than men, devoid of all that real moral worth, which con&s;titutes human excellency. To WASHING|TON, the &s;hade of retirement was as luminous as that of the mo&s;t public theatre. It was here, that his &s;oul, unbent, di&s;|played all tho&s;e virtues, which are the ornament and the de|light of &s;ociety. Humane, charitable, wi&s;e and ju&s;t, in every &s;ituation, he was always con&s;i&s;tent, always equal to him&s;elf, al|ways evincing, that rectitude of conduct was his &s;overeign good. The poor found in him a guardian, genius a patron, the hone&s;t and the meritorious a friend; the di&s;&s;olute the impi|ous and the profane, always an enemy. Sincerely religious, his attendance upon the &s;ervice of his God, was the dictate of real piety. Immutably true, he could re&s;pect only truth in others. It was to him, the fir&s;t duty of man. Such his mo|de&s;ty, that whil&s;t he was the admiration of all, he alone, like Mo&s;es, de&s;cended from the mount, &s;eemed ignorant of the light which &s;hone around him. Such his prudence, that not a word, not an action e&s;caped him, which would not admit of a rational ju&s;tification. This &s;ingular character of rea&s;on accom|panied him through life. Yes, Brethren, it was in WASH|INGTON, that tho&s;e four cardinal virtues, ju&s;tice, prudence, temperance and fortitude, formed an union &s;o rare, and &s;o com|plete. To the&s;e virtues, was added an under&s;tanding, the mo&s;t clear and exten&s;ive. His various official communications, his addre&s;&s;es to his countrymen, his an&s;wers to the innumera|ble congratulations which he received, all of which are &s;uffici|ent to form volumes; what ever came from his pen, whil&s;t it was always di&s;tingui&s;hed by a &s;tyle the mo&s;t per&s;picuous, the mo&s;t &s;trong and manly, evinced at the &s;ame time, a va&s;t mind, a &s;uperior intellect, which could gra&s;p every thing, and which laboured ince&s;&s;antly to promote public and private felicity.</P>
<P>Such was, in part, the illu&s;trious citizen, who filled &s;o wide and &s;o honorable a &s;pace in the eye of America, and of the ci|vilized
<PB N="24" REF="037876_0023_101170075047CD08">
world; and who&s;e lo&s;s a nation this day deplores. I know, that my attempts to do ju&s;tice to his character, have fallen infinitely &s;hort, of what your affection demanded.&mdash;But, I am little conver&s;ant in the language of panegyrick. "Re|corded honours &s;hall gather round the monument of WASH|INGTON, and thicken over him. It is a &s;olid fabric, and will &s;upport the laurels that adorn it."</P>
<P>But Ah! Great and good as he was, the &s;cene of mortal ex|i&s;tence is clo&s;ed for ever. Yes, Fellow-Citizens, your belov|ed WASHINGTON, has fini&s;hed his cour&s;e. He is gone to ap|pear before that God, in whom he tru&s;ted, and his works have followed him. Happy moment, for thee, illu&s;trious &s;hade! But afflictive to a nation, which mourns thy lo&s;s, and which can find it's con&s;olation only in the rememberance of thy virtues, in an humble re&s;ignation to the decrees of an all-wi&s;e Provi|dence, and in it's gratitude for benefits received through thy in&s;trumentality. Long &s;hall thy name be dear to thy country. Long &s;hall the aged father, calling to his &s;on, point to thy tomb, and bid him remember WASHINGTON; bid him recol|lect thy virtues, and &s;eize the patriotic flame, which once glowed within thy bo&s;om. The tender mother too, hanging over her beloved &s;on, &s;hall drop the anxious tear, and hall the name of WASHINGTON; &s;hall exclaim, O! Like him, be thou, brave, prudent, temperate and ju&s;t. O! Be thou, like him, thy country's &s;hield in war, it's ornament in peace. And thou, America! Incumbent as thou now art over the tomb of thy beloved citizen, maye&s;t thou annually retrace his virtues, and con&s;ecrate his memory. May his actions be ever the ob|jects of thy emulation and thy prai&s;e.</P>
<P>Ah! Fellow-citizens, remember that virtue only is e&s;timable in the eyes of God; and that without it, republics are victims de&s;tined for the altars of ambition. Remember, that without ju&s;t &s;entiments of religion, virtue peri&s;hes; a dreadful pro&s;tra|tion of morals inevitably en&s;ues, and with that pro&s;tration, li|berty is gone for ever&mdash;Would you &s;hoot an arrow at the ra|pid lightning as it flies athwart the &s;ky; or, would you at|tempt to arre&s;t the oceans tide, by a &s;ingle pebble? As well might you attempt to retain virtue, the ba&s;is of private and public happine&s;s, the rock of all rational government, without religion. Ah! In an age, when religion has become the &s;port of libertini&s;m, and of philo&s;ophi&s;ts; in an age, when impiety is too often con&s;idered as the fir&s;t proof of brilliancy of genius; in an age, when thy religion, ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us! Is &s;coffed and reviled
<PB N="25" REF="037876_0024_1011700BDA7B9250">
by tho&s;e who are ignorant of it; in an age, when even our re|lation to a God, has been derided by wickedne&s;s and folly; in &s;uch an age, religion feels more than a momentary con&s;olation in embracing the tomb of WASHINGTON, and in holding him forth as another immortal example, that man in his greate&s;t perfection, is ever religious and faithful. O! Ye, who love your country, ye who would pre&s;erve for your&s;elves and your po&s;terity, republicani&s;m pure and uncontaminated, again, I en|treat you, be it yours to cheri&s;h religion, and to bear in mind the example of WASHINGTON. Ye, who yet contemn the degrading idea, that death is an eternal &s;leep; ye, who do not re&s;t upon the mi&s;erable and the dreadful hope of that de&s;truction, that extinction of being, at the thought of which virtue trem|bles, and the &s;oul &s;hrinks back with horror; ye, who can look beyond the grave, and there behold regions enlightened by the eternal meridian of God's unclouded &s;mile;&mdash;Regions in which piety and innocence live immortal; O! Make that God your friend. Then, like your beloved Fellow-Citizen, will you be &s;trong in virtue, and incapable of di&s;may; then will you, in that awful moment, which mu&s;t &s;oon tear us from all the &s;oul holds dear in this world, be enabled, like him, to ex|claim, "I have fought a good fight, I have fini&s;hed my cour&s;e, I have kept the faith. Henceforth, there is laid up for me a crown of righteou&s;ne&s;s, which the Lord, the righteous judge &s;hall give me at that day; and not to me only, but unto all them that love his appearing."</P>
