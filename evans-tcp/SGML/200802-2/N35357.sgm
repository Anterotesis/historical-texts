<P>TO make others happy, is to be happy our|&s;elves; beneficence is one of the cardinal virtues, "&s;aid Alcindor to Erga&s;tus, his &s;on: "it is one of the attributes of the &s;upreme be|ing, it is that which claims our reverence, and makes us the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible of his exi&s;tence.</P>

title. Born in an age of di&s;&s;ipation, of illu&s;tri|ous parents, who&s;e virtues were not equal to their titles, he had learnt at his own co&s;t the condition of one who is abandoned to the mo&s;t lively pa&s;|&s;ions, and knows not how to re&s;train them.</P>
<P>Recovered from his wanderings, he became &s;en&s;ible of the danger of a neglected education, and was de&s;irous of guarding his &s;on again&s;t the temptations of a number of in&s;ignificant beings, who followed no other guide but appetite. He was in no want of examples to enforce his exhor|tations; but he thought that the mo&s;t &s;triking, and what would make the deepe&s;t impre&s;&s;ion up|on the imagination, would be the narrative of his own life.</P>
<P>"Erga&s;tus," &s;aid he, one day, as they were taking a Tour in the park, at a &s;mall di&s;tance from his ca&s;tle, "I am going to treat you in a manner that few parents treat their &s;ons. I am de&s;irous by giving you a recital of the follies of my youth, to put it in your power to make your|&s;elf a good man, that your old age may be free from remor&s;e: few young men have this advan|tage.

he a&s;&s;umed, he plunged me in an aby&s;s of volup|tuou&s;ne&s;s. He was my only coun&s;ellor; the mo&s;t implicit obedience <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">infancy could not be more ob&s;equeous to the precepts of a parent than I was to the le&s;&s;ons of Philintus. In &s;hort, he was e|very thing.</P>
<P>I was &s;oon taught to recognize no other de&s;ire but my pa&s;&s;ions, and to have no other de&s;ire but that of gratifying them. Innocence, virtue and beauty could no longer claim re&s;pect. We got our&s;elves introduced into families, where we made it our &s;tudy to &s;educe tho&s;e whom impru|dence had expo&s;ed to our contemplation. Among others, who&s;e fall effects me mo&s;t was Cali&s;ta.</P>
<P>She was charming, my &s;on. Her heart was noble, her temper, her under&s;tanding, every thing about her was worthy of admiration, and irre&s;i&s;tably captivating. But what can innocence avail amid&s;t the tumults of the pa&s;&s;ions, and the deceitful artifices of &s;eduction? I gazed at her. She plea&s;ed me, and from that moment I thought of nothing el&s;e but to make her increa&s;e the number of my conque&s;ts. The mo&s;t flattering propo&s;als, attachment, &s;ighs and tears, were practi&s;ed to &s;educe this young beauty.</P>
<P>Three months e&s;caped without my perceiving that I had made the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;t progre&s;s. Exa&s;perat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d at the oppo&s;ition of Cali&s;ta, I had recour&s;e to Philintus, who at that time was a &s;tranger to the pa&s;&s;ion I had for her. What I thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to be only ta&s;te, was love; I never &s;u&s;pected that this was my ca&s;e; my vanity concealed my defeat from me.

of his pa&s;&s;ion is a mere child; &s;he re&s;i&s;ts him, and he is de&s;pairing, though not be&s;ide a clear &s;tream. To be &s;erious, my dear, your brain is out of order. Go into the woods, make them echo with your &s;ighs, and carve your lover's name on the bark of every tree; for you are unworthy either of my advice, or my friend&s;hip. It is a great pity that you &s;hould be lo&s;t to the world; you &s;et out well, and I had better hopes of you.</P>
<P>After this rallying he turned upon his heel, and went out. This reception chagrined me; I per&s;uaded my&s;elf that he made u&s;e of this han|dle to break with me; I formed a re&s;olution to &s;educe Cali&s;ta, to convince this diletanti, that I was more worthy of his acquaintance than he imagined.</P>
<P>That very night I planted my cannon, and was determined to be revenged of Cali&s;ta and Philintus. I intended to triumph over the weak|ne&s;s of the too credulous fair, and then to leave her to the tortures of remor&s;e. By this, my &s;on, you may perceive the dangers of the pa&s;&s;ions, and the misfortune of an ill conducted education. We give only &s;uperficial accompli&s;hments to our children, at the &s;ame time neglecting to form their hearts; virtue and rea&s;on, which only di&s;|tingui&s;h us from the brute creation, is either overlooked, or de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P>In pro&s;ecuting my ba&s;e de&s;ign, I hypocritically a&s;&s;umed the garb of virtue; by which means I impo&s;ed upon Cali&s;ta, and her relations, and I even expo&s;ed my&s;elf to raillery on the occa&s;ion. My reformation gave me &s;o much credit with people of character, that I was mentioned as an example for tho&s;e of my own age, You would be &s;urprized, nay, you cannot imagine how I

di&s;&s;embled; but your &s;urpri&s;e will cea&s;e, when you know the world your&s;elf, and you will then be of my opinion; that few per&s;ons really are what they appear to be.</P>
<P>Cali&s;ta accu&s;tomed her&s;elf to hear me profe&s;s my love for her, &s;he li&s;tened to me with atten|tion and an&s;wered me with kindne&s;s; but her mode&s;ty would not &s;uffer her to di&s;clo&s;e her &s;en|timents. One day I found her alone, and pre&s;|&s;ed her to make &s;ome return to my love. She lifted up her eyes to me, which expre&s;&s;ed both inclination and mode&s;ty. 'Will you never keep company with Philintus any more?' &s;aid &s;he, in faultering accents. This que&s;tion, which had no relation to our di&s;cour&s;e, &s;urprized and per|plexed me. She perceived it: 'An&s;wer me,' &s;aid &s;he, 'but, no&mdash;do not. I had rather think you will not.' As &s;oon as &s;he had &s;aid this, &s;he ran away. Her flight di&s;concerted me very much. This caprice, which I could not account for, chagrined me; I was re&s;olved never more to &s;ee a raw girl that &s;eemed to be void of feeling.</P>
<P>Enraged with Cali&s;ta, I had recour&s;e to Phi|lintus. I met him that very day by chance. Though it was &s;omewhat di&s;agreeble to inform him of the bad &s;ucce&s;s of my project, the rage in which I was, forced me to di&s;clo&s;e the motives for the virtuous conduct, which I had a&s;&s;umed. He heard me with patience, and when I conclu|ded, embraced me. 'This artifice,' cried he, '&s;hews that you are worthy of my e&s;teem. Why! with all my craftine&s;s, I could not have played my part half &s;o well. Nay, I was my&s;elf de|ceived by your reformation. I pitied you a thou|&s;and times; and was really &s;orry for your weak|ne&s;s. But will you fling away the fruits of &s;ix

months re&s;traint? Cali&s;ta is but a weak girl; &s;he is in love with you, and a &s;ingle moment may bring her into your arms. The que&s;tion &s;he has propo&s;ed to you, &s;uppo&s;es that you mu&s;t drop my acquaintance. I forgive her, but &s;hall wait for my turn. Conceal our reconciliation from her with the greate&s;t precaution. We will &s;ee each other in &s;ecret. Adieu, remember that your re|putation depends upon the affair.'</P>
<P>When alone, I loved Cali&s;ta more than I ima|gined; her tears, her de&s;pair, which I anticipa|ted, overwhelmed me with confu&s;ion. But alas! I had gone too far to retreat. I got rid of the impertinence of reflection, thought of nothing but &s;ecuring the victim.</P>
<P>I &s;aw Cali&s;ta again, on the earne&s;t invitation of her mother. She was ignorant of the di&s;tre&s;s, which &s;he was going to bring upon her daughter. Notwith&s;tanding all that I had heard from Phi|lintus. I could not meet her without changing colour. I imagined that &s;he could read in my very eyes the criminal projects which I had en|tered into. I found her melancholy; a &s;udden flu&s;h, an emotion, which &s;he could not &s;uppre&s;s, convinced me that I was not di&s;agreeable to her. This conviction, in&s;tead of increa&s;ing my re|mor&s;e, &s;erved to di&s;per&s;e it. I per&s;uaded my&s;elf that &s;he would at la&s;t own her&s;elf obliged to me for teaching her how to &s;hake off the yoke of prejudice.</P>
<P>My pa&s;&s;ion, which increa&s;ed every day, forced me to leave no &s;tone unturned to obtain a com|plete victory. Philintus, whom I &s;aw every evening, &s;timulated me by his importunities. One day, being alone with Cali&s;ta, as I was &s;tri|ving to extort from her the conf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ion of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> af|fection

for me, a &s;light accident which happened to me let me into the &s;ecret, notwith&s;tanding her re&s;ervedne&s;s. I had &s;pent &s;everal nights in com|pany with Philintus and &s;ome other friends. My con&s;titution was rather delicate. A bleed|ing of the no&s;e, proceeding from fatigue and de|bauchery, &s;eized me in to violent a manner, that I found my&s;elf very much indi&s;po&s;ed. Cali&s;ta, being terrified, rung the bell, and called for her attendants, who were at that time fortunately from home, and &s;he was alone&mdash;alone with me in this condition. On my recovery I found my|&s;elf in her arms, She was bathed in tears. I perceived at that in&s;tant an inconceivable mix|ture of joy, plea&s;ure, and &s;hame. I &s;natched the hand of Cali&s;ta, which &s;he never thought of with|drawing, being ingro&s;&s;ed by other ideas. How happy am I! &s;aid I to her. Confirm my hap|pine&s;s, let one tender con&s;ent complete my feli|city! I adore you. I have no other wi&s;h, no other view than to dedicate my life to your &s;er|vice. She made no reply, but her looks di&s;cov|ered her thoughts. I imprinted a thou&s;and ki&s;|&s;es upon her hand; which I &s;till held between mine. The timorous Cali&s;ta, agitated with an emotion which encrea&s;ed every moment fell back|wards upon a couch, when one of her dome&s;tics entered. I was chagrined at his pre&s;ence, and took my leave a few minutes after in &s;o much trouble and confu&s;ion, that I could not tell where I was.</P>
<P>When I came home the idea of Cali&s;ta, her &s;weet delirium, her credulity, and her tender|ne&s;s, ru&s;hed upon my mind, and I thought it was a crime to take advantage of her innocence. My recovery was but of a &s;hort date, my unbridled
<PB N="10" REF="046224_0009_1020FCCD12C9FF60">
appetite returned, I once more re&s;olved that Cali&s;ta &s;hould gratify my pa&s;&s;ion. I went to her hou&s;e the next day, where, tho' I found a great deal of company, I found means of having a Tete-a-tete with her. I was convin|ced of her affection, but had no regard for the purity of my own. To cut this narrative &s;hort, my &s;on, &s;he was in love with me, and lov|ed me to her own ruin.</P>
<P>My attentions for Cali&s;ta di&s;covered our inti|macy to our two families. They talked of uni|ting us; but the propo&s;al alarmed me. My de|&s;ires were now gratified. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;everal ob|jections. The mother of Cali&s;ta, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ho was igno|rant of her daughter's weakne&s;s, di&s;gu&s;ted with the delay, which I cau&s;ed, broke off the treaty, and forbade Cali&s;ta to &s;ee me.</P>
<P>It was not long before this unfortunate lady repented of the &s;acrifice &s;he had made to me. She wrote to me, de&s;cribed her &s;ituation, and u&s;ed every method to &s;ecure my return. I did not conde&s;cend to give her any an&s;wer, nay, I had the ba&s;ene&s;s to expo&s;e her letters to Philin|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">us. He publi&s;hed them. The di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Cali&s;ta retired from the world, and re&s;olved to bury her &s;hame and de&s;pair in the glooms of a convent.</P>
<P>Other intrigues &s;erved to obliterate the very name of Cali&s;ta from my memory; there was no exce&s;s which I was not guilty of to avoid the ridicule of being thought religious or virtuous. I was guilty of &s;o many, that I found my&s;elf un|der a nece&s;&s;ity of quitting the capital, and went to join my regiment. War was declared &s;oon after; I was rejoiced at it, for my villainies be|gan to di&s;turb my repo&s;e. I endeavoured to &s;ig|nalize my&s;elf, not &s;o much from a de&s;ire of glory,
<PB N="11" REF="046224_0010_1020FCD0B26D2A18">
as to eraze the remembrance of the crimes I had been guilty of. A letter which I received from Philiatus, on his death-bed, made me dete&s;t my irregularities, and pay the fruitle&s;s tribute of re|mor&s;e to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ate of Cali&s;ta."</P>
<P>Alcindor was advanced thus far in his narra|tive; the remembrance of his debaucheries af|fected him with &s;o much horror that he was not able to continue it, when he perceived Alcipus approaching towards him.&mdash;This vi&s;it &s;urpri&s;ed him, becau&s;e for two years, in which they had lived in the &s;ame neighbourhood, they had made no connection. He recovered him&s;elf as he could, and went to meet him.</P>
<P>Alcipus, formerly a friend of Alcindor, had entirely declined his company on account of the badne&s;s of his character. He &s;incerely loved him, and always promoted his intere&s;ts, even unknown to him. After his return to the paths of virtue, Alcindor was &s;o much engro&s;&s;ed by his religious exerci&s;es and the education of his &s;on, that he lived in the greate&s;t privacy, with|out enquiring who belonged to the e&s;tate which was contiguous to his own. Some incroach|ments of the tenants had di&s;covered that it be|longed to Alcipus, but he did not venture to make him&s;elf known to him, and cho&s;e rather to give up his property.</P>
<P>Alcipus, after &s;ome compliments, taking Al|cindor a&s;ide, told him ingenuou&s;ly that the good|ne&s;s of his character had made him wi&s;h to re|new his acquaintance with him, and farther, to unite their families, if it were agreeable. "We are neighbours, &s;aid he, we have known each other for &s;ome time, our families may form an alliance together. With re&s;pect to fortune, I
<PB N="12" REF="046224_0011_1020FCD3AD52A940">
have more than enough to make your &s;on happy. I have no regard for punctilios or fal&s;e delicacy: it is but natural, that as you never vi&s;ited me, you could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to demand my daugh|ter of me, and therefore I am come to give you a voluntary offer of her. My dear friend, ad|ded he, I have heard much of your &s;on, I am in love with him; as for my daughter, &s;he is not di&s;agreeable, and I imagine they will make no bad match. If you will both of you come to my hou&s;e, you &s;hall &s;ee her, and I flatter my&s;elf that you will not reject the propo&s;al I have made to you.</P>
<P>Alcindor made his acknowledgments to his friend; but as he was de&s;irous of fini&s;hing his in&s;tructive hi&s;tory, or rather finding him&s;elf un|der a nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;clo&s;ing his di&s;tre&s;s and com|punctions, he prevailed on Alcipus to &s;pend the evening with him, promi&s;ing to attend him the next morning. Alcipus con&s;ented, they &s;upped together, and &s;pent their time in talking of things that were pa&s;t. Alcindor let &s;ome few tears e&s;cape him, on which account they chan|ged the &s;ubject of their di&s;cour&s;e, and the night was &s;pent in the &s;weet delights of friend&s;hip and gratitude.</P>
<P>It was &s;carce day break when Alcindor enter|ed the apartment of Erga&s;tus, who had pa&s;&s;ed one part of the night reflecting upon what his father had di&s;clo&s;ed unto him, The idea of the approaching alliance had di&s;turbed him likewi&s;e, what frivolity, and the love of mi&s;chief occa|&s;ions in young people, Erga&s;ius experienced, but from a different motive. A mild re&s;erved tem|per, a&s;&s;i&s;ted with an education, though not fa&s;hi|onable, yet at the &s;ame time founded upon ra|tional principles, enabled him to form a right
<PB N="13" REF="046224_0012_1020FCD9496B7FC0">
e&s;timate of things. He was apprehen&s;ive le&s;t a connection formed at his age, on the motive of intere&s;t, might render him unhappy; the be|nevolence of Alcipus charmed him, he was a|fraid of proving ungrateful, by refu&s;ing an alli|ance, or of being unhappy in uniting him&s;elf to a per&s;on who&s;e character and di&s;po&s;ition &s;hould be contrary to his own. The&s;e reflections di&s;|turbed him, when his father entered his apart|ment. After giving him &s;ome in&s;tructions re|lating to the vi&s;it they were to make, he re&s;um|ed his narrative in the following manner.</P>
<P>I told you, my &s;on, that Philintus wrote me a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">etter which deluged my eyes with tears. The poor man had abandoned him&s;elf &s;o much to de|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">auchery, that at four and twenty he could not help wi&s;hing for death, though he dur&s;t not pro|cure it. In this cri&s;is he came to him&s;elf, and repented his having been the ruin of a va&s;t num|ber of young men, who had too implicitely fol|lowed his pernicious coun&s;els. When we are on the point of giving an account of our actions, the veil, which intercepted the &s;ight of them, rends, and we are filled with horror; and the weakne&s;s of the body communicating it&s;elf to the mind, carries us in an in&s;tant from the exce&s;s of vice to that of a forced and involuntary repentance. The impo&s;&s;ibility of making reparation for the evils which we have done fills as with terror, which of it&s;elf would be &s;ufficient to accelerate our end. It was in this fatal moment that Phi|lintus, terrified with the retro&s;pect of his pa&s;t life, &s;ent for his friends&punc; confe&s;&s;ed the crimes he had perp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed, and exhorted them to repen|tance i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;o pathetic a manner, that mo&s;t of them, affected with the &s;pectacle they &s;aw before them,
<PB N="14" REF="046224_0013_1020FCDC4F663AF0">
changed their conduct, and became illu&s;trious for their virtue.</P>
<P>I was informed of the death of Philintus al|mo&s;t as &s;oon as his &s;ickne&s;s. The circum&s;tances with which it was attended almo&s;t freezed me with horror. I began to reflect, and I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s that the apprehen&s;ions of meeting a &s;imilar end had as much influence over me as virtue it|&s;elf. I turned my eyes within, I took a retro&s;|pect of my irregularities, I groaned at the vil|lainy I had been guilty of to Cali&s;ta; &s;hame co|vered my face, and de&s;pair got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my heart.</P>
<P>The peace which had lately been proclaimed, left me at liberty to repair to court. I returned thither very unlike my&s;elf. I employed my&s;elf in endeavouring to find out the unfortunate Ca|li&s;ta. Some years were &s;pent in the fruitle&s;s re&s;earch, at length time abated &s;omewhat of the poignancy of my remor&s;e, and I yielded to the importunities of a family, of which I was the only de&s;cendant. I married your mother. Love did not pre&s;ide at our wedding, my wounded heart could not harbour &s;o &s;weet a gue&s;t.

<P><PB N="16" REF="046224_0015_1020FCE000084530">Friend! &s;aid Alcipus to Alcindor, let us leave the young folks by them&s;elves, I have &s;omething to &s;ay to you, and we will join them in the park. Erga&s;tus gave his hand to Amelia, Selinda accompanied them. They walked &s;ome|time without &s;peaking to each other, and Selin|da, ab&s;orbed in melancholy, had no inclination to break &s;ilence. Erga&s;tus, at la&s;t ventured to &s;peak a few words, his looks and his expre&s;&s;ions were animated; love it&s;elf could not appear more irre&s;i&s;tible. He revealed his pa&s;&s;ion to A|melia with a force and energy, which could pro|ceed from &s;incerity alone. The amiable fair one, being in&s;tructed by her father before, did not &s;trive to conceal her feelings, and a mode&s;t, but ingenuous reply, in&s;ured the happine&s;s of her lover.</P>
<P>Satisfied with each other, they beheld no o|ther objects, and the arbour in which they were &s;eated was a little world to them. Amelia, who till that moment, had &s;een none but her lover, recollected Selinda, rolled her eyes in &s;earch of her, and was &s;urpri&s;ed not to find her. She was di&s;turbed at her ab&s;ence, and was go|ing in que&s;t of her. "I cannot ingro&s;s your attention, fair Amelia," &s;aid Erga&s;tus to her in the accents of tenderne&s;s, "what are you afraid of?" Nothing, replied the inamoretta, the re|gard I have for you is a kind of &s;ecurity or a pledge that you have the &s;ame for me. But Se|linda is in di&s;tre&s;s, and demands my attention. She has no relations; and being entru&s;ted to my father's care from her mo&s;t tender age, the knows no one but him. Till this cri&s;is &s;he has lived a happy life; but an alarming di&s;covery of her pre&s;ent &s;ituation has plunged her into the

glooms of melancholy. I conjure you, Erga&s;tus, to permit me to take her as my companion, and &s;uffer me to keep her with me as long as I live. Were you acquainted with her virtues? No vir|gin was ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more virtues than Selinda.</P>
<P>Charming Amelia, replied Erga&s;tus, I &s;hall never have any will but your's. It will give me the greate&s;t happine&s;s to contribute any ways to &s;often the pains of Selinda.</P>
<P>As they were &s;peaking, they looked after her; but how great was then a&s;toni&s;hment to find her in the arms of Alcindor, who, together with Al|cipus, was bathed in tears.</P>
<P>My &s;on, cried Alcindor, heaven has re&s;tored me my daughter, your &s;i&s;ter, and the very copy of Cali&s;ta.</P>
<P>Erga&s;tus and Amelia looked at each other with &s;urprize; but their &s;urprize was &s;uper&s;eded by the plea&s;ure to find a &s;i&s;ter in a friend, whom they loved &s;o much. Selinda quitted her fa|ther's embraces for tho&s;e of Erga&s;tus and Amelia. They demanded with all the eagerne&s;s of curi|o&s;ity how this di&s;covery was made? I can inform you, my children, replied Alcipus.</P>
<P>Cali&s;ta, preyed on by the mo&s;t lively &s;orrow, had confidence enough to repo&s;e in me the &s;ecret of her circum&s;tances, and her ju&s;t apprehen&s;ions. Her parents were going to confine her to tho&s;e gloomy retreats, which are dedicated for the re|ception of involuntary penitents. I formed the re&s;olution of &s;natching her from their obduracy. I was aquainted with the &s;uperior of the convent, where &s;he was to re&s;ide till her delivery. We concerted mea&s;ures to re&s;cue di&s;tre&s;&s;ed innocence. The relations of Cali&s;ta were &s;o much blinded
<PB N="18" REF="046224_0017_1020FCE494E10438">
with rage, that it was no very difficult matter to impo&s;e upon them. A pretended illne&s;s and death, which they &s;eemed to hear of with plea|&s;ure, were the means we made u&s;e of to re&s;cue Cali&s;ta.&mdash;My &s;i&s;ter carried her to the extreme parts of Sile&s;ia, where &s;he has a &s;mall e&s;tate. The di&s;tre&s;&s;ed fair was delivered of Selinda, and her &s;orrows put an end to her mi&s;eries. With her dying breath &s;he conjured us to have pity on her orphan daughter, to conceal her birth from her, and make u&s;e of our utmo&s;t endeavours to in&s;pire her with the love of a religious life.</P>
<P>We undertook this charge. I married a lit|tle while afterwards, and had Amelia. I brought them up together. The unwillingne&s;s of Selin|da to take the veil obliged me to di&s;clo&s;e &s;ome part of the fatal &s;ecret. She felt the di&s;tre&s;s of her circum&s;tances, lamented them with the pangs of angui&s;h, and per&s;i&s;ted in her refu&s;al. My daughter, whom I took out of the convent, beg|ged me to let her be with her; I con&s;ented to her reque&s;t with joy. By chance I under&s;tood that Alcindor had &s;een his error, and was be|come a convert to virtue. I knew he had a &s;on, whom he had educated him&s;elf. I then conceived the de&s;ign of marrying my daughter to him, and to prepare my old friend to recognize his (daugh|ter.) My wi&s;hes are accompli&s;hed. I have but one condition to make with re&s;pect to my daugh|ter's marriage, which is this; my fortune is con|&s;iderable, I &s;hall divide it between Amelia and Selinda: I offer my heart to the latter; her fa|ther gives his con&s;ent; and to be &s;hort, one word will unite all four of us together.</P>
<P>Alcindor, who had gone a&s;ide to avoid hear|ing the narrative of Alcipus, returned at this

period, and a&s;ked Selinda if &s;he would give her con&s;ent.</P>
<P>Yes, my dear father, replied &s;he, the obliga|tions I am under to Alcipus cannot be compen|&s;ated but by the mo&s;t &s;incere affection and at|tachment. I am ready to perform any thing you can command.</P>
<P>Alcindor, Alcipus, Erga&s;tus, Amelia, and Se|linda embraced and congratulated each other on account of an alliance &s;o happy, and &s;o un|fore&s;een.</P>
<P>The two weddings were &s;olemnized without pomp, but with a general &s;atisfaction. Alcin|dor retired to a &s;olitary place, where he employed him&s;elf in regretting his dear Cali&s;ta. He went yearly to vi&s;it his children, imparted to them the fruits of his meditations, and recommended to them, above all things, to remember his fail|ings, that they might not only pre&s;erve their children from the &s;ame, but likewi&s;e all tho&s;e whom providence &s;hould commit to their care.</P>

<P>MISS Jenny Brad&s;haw was one of tho&s;e figures which, without being very regu|lar, had &s;omething in her which &s;eldom fails to plea&s;e and charm. Born with a candid and vir|tuous heart, each day produced in her all the re|qui&s;ite qualities for making a hu&s;band happy. The pride, in&s;pired by high life, prai&s;es, flat|tery, and &s;till more the bad examples and wrong conceived maxims of the Lady, her mother,
<PB N="20" REF="046224_0019_1020FCEA57C4F9E8">
wife to Sir James Brad&s;haw, of an opulent for|tune in Hamp&s;hire, &s;oon corrupted her good di&s;|po&s;itions. This Lady re&s;ided always in London during the winter &s;ea&s;on, and with reluctance quitted it even in &s;ummer, &s;o few attractions had rural plea&s;ures for her, comparatively to the means that facilitated her gratifications in town. She was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a &s;ingular mania of be|lieving her&s;elf a fine wit, and greatly admired for her va&s;t erudition. One time &s;he was &s;een to enter the li&s;t with a band of Literation po|litical, religious, and metaphy&s;ical di&s;cu&s;&s;ions. Mallebranche, Locke, and Newton, were favour|ite authors with her. Another time &s;he prided in giving her patronage to every young adven|turer in author&s;hip of any kind; &s;he read all the pamphlets, plays, and poems they brought her, and in the enthu&s;ia&s;ms of her heart con&s;i|dered her&s;elf as the only arbiter of good ta&s;te.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Jenny a&s;&s;i&s;ted a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly at the conferen|ces held in her Lady&s;hip's apartment. As &s;he grew up, the inclinations of the mother gathered &s;trength in her, but &s;ucce&s;s was not an&s;werable to her de&s;ires. She had &s;ome difficulty in ex|pre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf. Often, in the mid&s;t of a con|ver&s;ation, &s;he would &s;top &s;hort, as bewildered. Forming two or three connected phra&s;es was to her a painful bu&s;ine&s;s. A natural timidity &s;till added to the embara&s;&s;ment of her tongue. No|thing could vex her Mamma more than the poor di&s;play of her argumentative faculties: &s;he did not cea&s;e preaching to her daughter, and in her &s;cientific delirium would cite examples to her of &s;ome philo&s;ophic Ladies, and many others of the &s;ex, who had di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves for their genius in a variety of compo&s;ition. How can
<PB N="21" REF="046224_0020_1020FCED081A3800">
your frozen imagination, &s;aid &s;he, receive no warmth, collect no fire from the reading of the works of &s;uch incomparable women? See what glory has crowned them! will you, by indolent life add to the number of ordinary women, who&s;e &s;ole talent is to adorn, and to borrow from art charms which nature has refu&s;ed them, or add to the number of tho&s;e that wa&s;te their time and &s;pirits amid&s;t the ob&s;cure details of dome&s;|tic occupation. A woman properly is no other wi&s;e commendable but by the extent of her wit and genius.</P>
<P>Such was Lady Brad&s;haw's manner of con|&s;tantly lecturing her daughter. She was igno|rant how dangerous it is to tamper at procuring too much wit for women. Nature calculated them for plea&s;ing and not for becoming learned. A forgetfulne&s;s of the duties annexed to their condition is the fruit of a ta&s;te mi&s;placed on &s;ci|ences. The wanderings of the mind common|ly produce tho&s;e of the heart. A young Lady that &s;eeks in&s;truction, in the view of &s;hining as learned, is but too often in&s;tructed at the ex|pence of her virtue.</P>
<P>Opportunity &s;oon favoured the de&s;igns of her Lady&s;hip on Mi&s;s Jenny. Mr. Reynolds, a young Gentleman of &s;ome rank, but of depraved morals, &s;eemed to her the fitte&s;t per&s;on for in&s;pi|ring her daughter with a love of the Belles Let|tres. This Mr. Reynolds was one of tho&s;e &s;u|perficial beings that haunt all our gay towns and places of re&s;ort, yet able only to impo&s;e on the &s;en&s;ele&s;s and undi&s;cerning multitude. He had &s;omething of a &s;prightly imagination, &s;poke with ea&s;e and fluency, and rea&s;oned upon every thing without knowing any thing to the bottom.
<PB N="22" REF="046224_0021_1020FCEF01AEE498">
The reading of novels and plays was his prin|cipal occupation. He would de&s;cant on the me|rit of every actor and actre&s;s on the &s;tage, and as a perfect connoi&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur in theatrical matters, would enter into minute details of their ju&s;tne&s;s or improprieties. He al&s;o pretended to be an adept in the doctrine of chances at any &s;ort of game or diver&s;ion. Nothing could be more plea&s;ing to him than the favourable opinion La|dy Brad&s;haw entertained of his qualifications. For a long time he had been courting &s;ome no|tice from her, and he &s;ecretly a&s;pired to Mi&s;s Jenny. He had already made &s;ome &s;ucce&s;sful attempts in that way; but Jenny was a rich heire&s;s, and him&s;elf had di&s;&s;ipated a good part of his patrimony, &s;o that he had rea&s;on to appre|hend le&s;t the inequality of fortune might become an ob&s;tacle to his de&s;ires. How great was his joy, and how confident his pre&s;umption, when he &s;aw him&s;elf permitted to give le&s;&s;ons to his dear Jenny. He profited of every occurrence in them that could be applicable to love (for his fir&s;t le&s;&s;ons were out of romances and novels) to make the ca&s;e her's and his own, and more e&s;|pecially, when a &s;trained &s;en&s;ibility took place, all the &s;ighs and raptures of Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ixoti&s;m were a|dopted. Thus it was that this new Abelard and this new Eloi&s;a &s;pent the moments in amo|rous parley, which Lady Brad&s;haw imagined to be dedicated to &s;tudy: 'Mr Reynolds, &s;aid &s;he, I find my daughter has a &s;moother and rea|dier elocution &s;ince &s;he has been under your tu|ition; her mind begins to open, and her intel|lects &s;hew a more clear and lively conception.'</P>
<P>Reynolds, with many flattering &s;peeches kept the mother in her fatal delu&s;ion. He &s;aw with
<PB N="23" REF="046224_0022_1020FCF4148E92C0">
plea&s;ure the progre&s;s his young pupil made in the &s;cience of love. Now he tried what effect &s;oft and tender poetry might have on her mind. Ovid's Art of love and his Epi&s;tles were not for|got. To the&s;e &s;ucceeded &s;ome &s;elect pa&s;&s;ages from Tragedy. The young Lady's imagination became daily more heated. He was careful to dwell longer on the more pa&s;&s;ionate parts to give Mi&s;s Jenny a due feeling of them; &s;he li&s;tened to him with avidity, and in&s;en&s;ibly &s;uffered her&s;elf to be wrought upon to give into all the &s;nares of &s;eduction. Already they wrote the tendere&s;t billets-doux to each other. Their interviews and conver&s;ation were more frequent under the &s;pecious pretext of acquiring wit, and, the more they &s;aw each other, the more they loved.</P>
<P>Sir James Brad&s;haw, a man of rough manners, and little or no learning, had however wit and &s;en&s;e enough to know his wife's foible. At times he would become boi&s;terous, and fly out into a pa&s;&s;ion again&s;t her, reproaching her tartly with her &s;trange ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ner of conducting her&s;elf and fa|mily. He loved &s;incerely his children, was &s;ol|licitous for their welfare, and did not look with &s;o indifferent an eye as his Lady on the prepo&s;|terous education of his daughter. On this ac|count he expre&s;sly forbad her to receive Rey|nolds's vi&s;its. This order &s;eemed to &s;trike Jen|ny with con&s;ternation. Love had made too deep a wound in her heart. Nothing was capable of effecting her cure.</P>
<P>The impetuous temper of the Baronet, and the melancholy air of Jenny's countenance, were &s;oon as pre&s;ages to Mr. Reynolds that &s;ome &s;torm was gathering again&s;t his happine&s;s; and what confirmed him in his notions was the cold recep|tion
<PB N="24" REF="046224_0023_1020FCF811380908">
he had from Lady Brad&s;haw. She at length began to think that his a&s;&s;iduities to her daugh|ter might be attended with very di&s;agreeable con&s;equences. Reynolds had grounded his prin|cipal hopes on the confidence that blind mother had placed in him; however, as an expert man, and ver&s;ed in the airs of intrigue, he &s;chemed other mea&s;ures to attain his end. He knew how Mi&s;s Jenny's heart was di&s;po&s;ed; he was belov|ed by it, and he agreed with her, that it was be&s;t to de&s;i&s;t from further vi&s;its; but, before &s;epara|ting, they concerted the means of keeping up an epi&s;tolary corre&s;pondence.</P>
<P>Reynolds appeared no more at Lady Brad|&s;haw's a&s;&s;emblies, which indeed were now be|come le&s;s frequent than before. He wrote pret|ty often to Jenny, and &s;trove to di&s;po&s;e her in|&s;en&s;ibly to private interviews. He knew by ex|perience that love is irritated by difficulties, and that a young female, once going beyond the bounds of mode&s;ty, runs afterwards of her&s;elf to the precipice. Mi&s;s Jenny after many reflex|ions, fears, uncertainties, and after having li&s;|tened to and long &s;truggled again&s;t the murmur|ings of virtue, yielded at la&s;t to her lover's &s;oli|citations. They &s;aw each other as often as op|portunities &s;erved, by the intervention of a wait|ing woman, to whom Reynolds, in the di&s;gui&s;e of a country farmer, was to per&s;onate the lover. This &s;tratagem &s;ucceeded from time to time with little or no interruption. In the country, Mi&s;s Jenny and her maid u&s;ed to take their evening walks by the rece&s;&s;es of wood<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; and along the banks of winding &s;treams. Here too the indu&s;|trious lover failed not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> meet.

<PB N="25" REF="046224_0024_1020FCF99E12B330">
every thing, in &s;hort, painted for Jenny the &s;cenes and the language of love. While the maid would &s;tep a&s;ide to gather &s;ome wild flow|er that catched her eye, the amorous pair would go a&s;tray, and often out of &s;ight, in their agree|able &s;olitude. Reynolds became more pa&s;&s;ion|ate and fond; Jenny more adventurous and more weak. What will not an enterpri&s;ing lover &s;o circum&s;tanced, attempt? Jenny lo&s;t &s;ight of vir|tue, and was defeated.</P>
<P>Reynolds applauded him&s;elf in &s;ecret for his triumph. His happine&s;s appeared certain to him. A marriage &s;o much to his advantage would repair the di&s;orders of his fortune occa&s;i|oned by the eccentricities of libertine youth. Jenny on the other &s;ide, &s;oon became incon&s;ola|ble. Her heart was rent, her mind di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and depre&s;&s;ed by all the remor&s;e that commonly follows illicit plea&s;ure and the lo&s;s of virtue. She dared no more appear before her mother, and how &s;hould &s;he confe&s;s her fault to her? To what reproaches was not &s;he going to expo&s;e her&s;elf?

for &s;o engaging a form! She lived with us till &s;he was turned of fourteen, at which time we were prevailed on by a friend to place her with a gentleman of fortune in the country, (who had lately buried his lady), to be the companion of his daughters. The gentleman's character was too honourable, and the offer too advantageous, to &s;uffer us to he&s;itate long about parting with a child whom, dear to us as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he was, we were not able to &s;upport. It is now a little more than two years &s;ince our &s;eparation, and till within a very few months it was our happine&s;s and joy we had provided for her &s;o fortunately. She lived in the e&s;teem and friend&s;hip of the young ladies, who were indeed very amiable per&s;ons, and &s;uch was their father's &s;eeming indulgence to us, that he advanced my hu&s;band a &s;um of money upon his bond, to free him from &s;ome &s;mall debts which threatened him hourly with a jail.</P>
<P>But how &s;hall I tell you, Sir, that this &s;eem|ing benefactor has been the cruele&s;t of all ene|mies!

It is now upwards of two months &s;ince we have heard from her at all; and while we were wondering at her &s;ilence, we received a letter from the elde&s;t of the young ladies, which threw us into a perplexity which can neither be de&s;cribed nor imagined.

<P>Salvador found his heart wounded for the fir&s;t time. A con&s;uming fire, which circulated through all his veins, informed him that he was in love; he &s;huddered at the event, but could no longer prevent it, a &s;ingle glance had infla|med him for the re&s;t of his life. It is the na|ture of great pa&s;&s;ions to be born in an in&s;tant. The count perceived his embara&s;&s;ment, and im|puted it to his reviving the idea of his misfor|tunes. He made him &s;everal very polite apolo|gies, and in order to divert his thoughts, took him a&s;ide into his garden. "You are ma&s;ter of all my hou&s;e," &s;aid he to Salvador; "look upon it as your own; e&s;teem me as your parent; your age, and my friend&s;hip, vindicate me in a&s;&s;uming that title.

From that in&s;tant he was re&s;olved to &s;truggle again&s;t his pa&s;&s;ion; but he &s;truggled in vain! It is in vain to wre&s;tle with our fate. His inflamed heart re&s;i&s;ted in vain the pa&s;&s;ion by which it was en&s;laved. The reflection he made to de&s;troy his affection &s;erved only to increa&s;e it. He &s;aw and conver&s;ed with I&s;abella every day, and drank from her eyes the fire which con&s;u|med him. The &s;ound of her voice, or guitar, pierced his heart, the fragrance of the flowers which &s;he wore in her bo&s;om overpowered him; all his &s;en&s;es were intoxicated with love, and his pa&s;&s;ion was never more violent, than when his feeble rea&s;on &s;trove to &s;uppre&s;s it.</P>
<P>Love made as great a progre&s;s in the heart of I&s;abella. Her eyes were fixed upon tho&s;e of Sal|vador, and were rejoiced to meet them; a &s;ecret anxiety made her unea&s;y in his ab&s;ence, and the days which they pa&s;&s;ed together &s;ted away like &s;o many moments. The mo&s;t intimate confi|dence was e&s;tabli&s;hed between them. Their mouth was a &s;tranger to the &s;ecret of their hearts, their eyes communicated their mutual thoughts and de&s;ires; and the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing each other, left them no other to wi&s;h for. That age mu&s;t be very deplorable in which the &s;ight of two young and innocent lovers &s;hould appear either &s;trange, or chimerical!</P>
<P>The happine&s;s of Salvador and I&s;abella want|ed nothing for its completion, but &s;ome circum|&s;tances which taught them the value of it. One

day Salvador, with an heart and eyes full of tenderne&s;s, met with I&s;abella as &s;he was going up to her apartments. The elegant di&s;order of her di&s;habille &s;eemed to give a great addition to her charms. Never had &s;he appeared to him with &s;o much beauty. He offered her his hand, and trembled to receive hers. He gra&s;ped it &s;oftly. He thought he felt it tremble, and in his tran&s;port <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> glued his burning lips upon it. I&s;abella was in great agitation. She bla&s;hed, and retired.</P>
<P>Salvador, intoxicated with plea&s;ure, was at length confu&s;ed with the thought or his daring to offend one whom he loved: it was &s;ome time before he was able to appear in her pre&s;ence. He dreaded her &s;ight and he had rea&s;on for do|ing &s;o. I&s;abella thought her&s;elf offended. Though &s;he was not without feeling, &s;he was neverthele&s;s of rigid virtue; and the ra&s;hne&s;s of her lover appeared inexcu&s;able. However, chance offered him an opportunity of excu&s;ing him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The king's comedians had brought out a new play. The count d'Almodovar begged Salva|dor, who had been at it the fir&s;t night, to give &s;ome account of it before I&s;abella and a nume|rous company: the &s;ubject of the piece was a quarrel between too lovers, occa&s;ioned by an in|di&s;creet &s;alute. Salvador enforced the excu&s;es <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f the &s;hepherd with &s;o much addre&s;s and warmth, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd de&s;cribed his di&s;tre&s;s in &s;o pathetic a man|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er, that the company would have been di&s;|plea&s;ed, had not the &s;hepherde&s;s granted him his pardon. I&s;abella perceived that Salvador was pleading his own cau&s;e: &s;he was affected with his remor&s;e, the turn he gave to his ex|cu&s;es,
<PB N="36" REF="046224_0035_1020FD1758E3FA90">
and with the glance from her eyes, a&s;|&s;ured him of his pardon.</P>
<P>The reconciliation which took place between them was productive of a &s;hortlived happine&s;s. A croud of &s;uitors flocked to I&s;abella; they were all &s;uitable to her in age, fortune, and birth. I&s;abella was not a little di&s;turbed at the appli|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ations which were made to her. She confided in the affection which her father had for her, as a means of avoiding an engagement which was di&s;agreeable to her. But Salvador was in de&s;|pair, from an apprehen&s;ion of lo&s;ing the object of his affections. He reproached him&s;elf for be|ing an ob&s;tacle to the happine&s;s of I&s;abella; for di&s;turbing the tranquility of a worthy family; for practi&s;ing upon the affections of the daughter of his friend; and he was re&s;olved to triumph over his weakne&s;s. He &s;aw I&s;abella but &s;eldom; but the efforts he made to conquer his pa&s;&s;ion flung him into a profound melancholy, and im|paired his health. I&s;abella perceived it, and was greatly alarmed. She was re&s;olved to run any ri&s;k to procure his recovery. She wrote him a billet, which &s;he &s;ent by a &s;lave, whom &s;he thought &s;he could confide in. Salvador received it with an anxiety, which was not very favourable to his cure; it was to the following effect.</P>

You have fallen into a melancholy, which affects me very much; you drag on a chagrin which preys upon you: your health is impaired; I have till now avoided enquiring into the cau&s;e of your melancholy, but if it be in my power to afford you any con&s;olation, the keeping it a &s;ecret is a crime in the eyes of friend&s;hip. Does my friend&s;hip cea&s;e to be a|greeable to you? Has my daughter forgot the regards which are due to you? Have my friends or dome&s;tics neglected you?

<P>Salvador, pierced with &s;o affecting an ad|dre&s;s, and a&s;hamed to harrow up the &s;oul of &s;o generous a friend, was for &s;ome time in &s;u&s;pen&s;e whether he &s;hould not fall at his feet, and di&s;|cover the whole affair to him; but he was ap|prehen&s;ive of making too deep a wound in his own heart; he conceived the ra&s;h hopes of ba|ni&s;hing him&s;elf from the heart of I&s;abella, and to reconcile her to the views of her father. He pretended that the motive of his melancholy was his di&s;tance from his own country, the re|membrance of his misfortunes, and &s;everal other circum&s;tances which is not in the power of the count to redre&s;s. He thanked him hearti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y for his friendly offers, and quitted him with a thou+<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nd prote&s;tations of gratitude.</P>

read it; on reflecting upon the contents, he was filled with apprehen&s;ions, and pro&s;trated him|&s;elf at his ma&s;ter's feet, where he confe&s;&s;ed his crime, and di&s;covered the contents of the billet with which he had been charged; and the con|fu&s;ion, joy, and tran&s;port with which Salvador had peru&s;ed it. This impoi&s;oned the brea&s;t of the father with jealou&s;y, hatred, and fury. "It is this wretch, then," cried the count, "that has di&s;turbed her tranquility, betrayed his friend&s;hip, and violated the laws of ho&s;pitality! the wretch! with what artfulne&s;s did he wipe off the tears, which he alone was the cau&s;e of! With what perfidiou&s;ne&s;s did he receive my ad|dre&s;&s;es! How calmly did he enjoy the fruit of his crimes! Bid him quit my hou&s;e directly," &s;aid he to one of his dome&s;tics, "and never dare to come there again." In the height of his fury he wrote him the following billet:</P>
<P>"You have betrayed my friend&s;hip and con|fidence: quit a hou&s;e of which you are the di&s;|grace, and never dare to appear again in the pre&s;ence of a friend whom you have &s;o cruelly offended."</P>
<P>The count d' Almodovar &s;et no bounds to his pa&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e he thought that Salvador had &s;et none to his. The contempt he had for tho&s;e of his own times, and the ill-will which he bore them, were united again&s;t Salvador and I&s;abella. He might have been convinced of their inno|cence, but his natural ferocity, and the rigidne&s;s of his principles were equally hurt; and he ran the ri&s;k of doing an injury to his daughter, merely for the &s;ake of a pretence of hating a friend. Salvador was overwhelmed with grief, but he re&s;igned him&s;elf to his exile without mur|muring

again&s;t I&s;abella's father. He imputed his misfortunes to none but him&s;elf; he did not he&s;itate to &s;eek an a&s;ylum f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r from the &s;pot where the count re&s;ided, and he formed a re&s;olution which he kept inviolate; which was never to di&s;turb the repo&s;e of I&s;abella, or to augment the grief of her father by his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>I&s;abella heard of the departure of Salvador, without being informed of the cau&s;e. She dur&s;t not &s;peak of it to any one, nor dur&s;t any one, &s;peak of it to her. At one time &s;he grieved at the cruel u&s;age, which &s;he was apprehen|&s;ive that he was unable to &s;upport; at another time &s;he was offended at his coolne&s;s; &s;he accu|&s;ed him of de&s;erting her, and, if it were po&s;&s;i|ble, of hating her. "If he loved me &s;till," &s;aid &s;he, "would he not have contrived to &s;ee me? Should I not have &s;een him at church, or the publick walks, or at the play? Would not love have in&s;pired him with &s;ome expedients to a&s;&s;ure me that he loved me &s;till?</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding I&s;abella con&s;tantly rejected all the offers that were made her, &s;he artfully eluded the importunities which her father made u&s;e of to engage her to choo&s;e a hu&s;band. She knew that Salvador ought to carry his point at court; that the king had honoured him with &s;trong promi&s;es, and &s;he hoped that if the fa|vours he might meet with were any wi&s;e &s;uitable to his birth, and the lo&s;s of his e&s;tates, he would &s;oon be in a condition to offer her a hand, which her father him&s;elf would urge her to accept.</P>
<P>Salvador cheri&s;hed the &s;ame ideas in his re|tirement. The image of I&s;abella was always before his eyes. He would not have wi&s;hed, for

the &s;ake of I&s;abella, that &s;he &s;hould think too much of him; but he could not but wi&s;h that &s;he would not imagine him incon&s;tant. He often repeated the &s;ong which &s;he &s;ent him, wrote it upon the &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ds of the Tagus, and engraved it upon the bark<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the orange trees which grew upon the banks of that river. He dwelt with &s;ingular delight upon the la&s;t line.</P>
<Q>I love,&mdash;and I &s;hall love for life.</Q>
<P>He knew the inexorablene&s;s and the views of the count d'Almodovar: he could not flatter him&s;elf with a certainty of ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing I&s;abel|la: but at the &s;ame time finding no ob&s;tacles which might not be &s;urmounted, his heart gave entrance to hope. He redoubled his applica|tions to the king; and in hopes of obtaining &s;ome favour from him, which might make him nearer to I&s;abella in point of fortune, he fre|quently vi&s;ited the mini&s;ters, and laid a&s;ide that air of importance which his birth and the ju&s;|tice of his preten&s;ions in&s;pired him with. Love, which melts the mo&s;t &s;avage, &s;oftened his tem|per. He became an a&s;&s;iduous, importunate, if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t a &s;ervile &s;uitor; for nothing appeared mor|tifying to him, when compared with the lo&s;s of I&s;abella.</P>
<P>One day as he was at the levee of Don Die|go de Mello, the Lord high-admiral, a lady whom he formerly had been acquainted with, and was waiting as well as him&s;elf to have an audience of the admiral, acco&s;ted him. She was an intimate friend of the count d'Almodo|var, and had heard a part of Salvador's hi&s;tory, which affected her. Whether it were from cu|rio&s;ity,

or compa&s;&s;ion for his misfortunes, &s;he &s;pake to him concerning I&s;abella, informed him that her health was impaired more and more every day; that &s;he con&s;tantly refu&s;ed every offer which was made her, and at la&s;t, promi&s;ed to introduce him to her, if &s;he could do it with|out wounding either her di&s;cretion, or her deli|cacy. Salvador clo&s;ed the propo&s;al with tran&s;|port, and the day and place for receiving the an&s;wer were fixed. At the time appointed he flew to the place of rendezvous; but how great was his agony when he was informed, that "I&s;a|bella heard his name mentioned with indiffer|ence, that &s;he pretended to que&s;tion whether he had any great de&s;ire of an interview, and that &s;he at la&s;t ordered her to acquaint him that &s;he was quite recovered.</P>
<P>Heavens! cried he, is it po&s;&s;ible that I&s;abella &s;hould be incon&s;tant, unju&s;t, and cruel! Even though &s;he cea&s;ed to love me, providing her in|difference would have contributed to her health, I &s;hould not have complained; but to &s;u&s;pect that I was no ways interre&s;ted in her health, to give me notice of her incon&s;tancy, to plunge the dagger her&s;elf into my heart, is &s;uch a &s;hock as I cannot &s;upport! I am determined to fly a place where there can be no feelings, when there are none in I&s;abella's heart.</P>
<P>He ran over every part of the inhabitable globe in idea in que&s;t of a place to bury his grief in. But his choice was &s;oon fixed, a &s;ecret, a natural propen&s;ity generally attracts us to our own country. He recollected, that among&s;t the Indians, who are in alliance with his ance&s;tors, the Marattoes were the mo&s;t numerous, the mo&s;t courageous, and mo&s;t favourable to his own

views, becau&s;e they were continually at war with the Portugue&s;e. He was re&s;olved to &s;eek an a&s;ylum among them, and &s;olicit a commi&s;&s;ion in their army. He &s;oon informed them of his de&s;cent, and gave them proofs of his courage. The &s;kill he acquired in military affairs enabled him to di&s;cipline their troops. Though he &s;ought for death in every engagement, he met with nothing but glory. A man may ea&s;ily be|come a hero who had no value for his life! The Indians regarded Salvador as &s;ome cele&s;tial be|ing, who was &s;ent to protect their liberty and their country; they imagined a &s;overeign who re&s;embled him would in&s;ure their happine&s;s; and the unanimous voice of the nation placed him upon the throne. He a&s;cended it with tran&s;port, in hopes of &s;haring it with I&s;abella.</P>
<P>I have, &s;aid he, at la&s;t a throne to offer to one, who is more worthy of it than any other. The ab&s;olute &s;overeign of my heart, &s;he &s;hall be &s;o likewi&s;e of an exten&s;ive dominion; but this do|minion is rather too &s;mall, I could wi&s;h to be the king of the univer&s;e, to make her a more meri|torious offer.</P>
<P>Salvador thus plea&s;ed him&s;elf with the idea of pre&s;enting a crown to his mi&s;tre&s;s. But he was perplexed for the means of obtaining her accep|tion. &mdash;The war which the Portugue&s;e carried on again&s;t the Marattoes, and e&s;pecially the im|men&s;e di&s;tance which &s;eparated him from I&s;abel|la, formed almo&s;t in&s;uperable ob&s;tacles to his wi&s;hes. He imagined that I&s;abella was at Li&s;|bon, and was under a mi&s;take. She had traver|&s;ed the ocean, inhabited the &s;ame continent as him&s;elf, and almo&s;t breathed the &s;ame air.

At the head of a numerous army he ventured to lay &s;iege to Goa, which was the capital of the Portugue&s;e. It was fortified both by nature and art, but what fortre&s;&s;es can re&s;i&s;t an invinci|ble courage? That of the Marattoes bordered upon &s;avagene&s;s. The re&s;i&s;tance which the Por|tugue&s;e made, augmented their ferocity, fury and rage took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their brea&s;ts, and with a general cry they demanded to be led on to the a&s;&s;ault.

<HEAD><HI>Hi&s;tory of DORANTES.</HI> A Moral Tale founded on fact.</HEAD>
<P>DORANTES was naturally well di&s;|po&s;ed, and full of &s;en&s;ibility; but lo&s;ing his parents in his infancy, he was intru&s;ted to the care of mercenary tutors, who regarded their &s;alaries more than the improvement of their pu|pil. I need not &s;ay that their abilities were not very great; it cannot be otherwi&s;e where per&s;ons are void of <HI>&s;entiment.</HI></P>
<P>Dorantes de&s;pi&s;ed his tutors and con&s;equently conceived a very high opinion of him&s;elf, and was ob&s;tinate in all his de&s;ires.</P>
<P>This character grew into a habit by the time when a per&s;on enters into the world, and choo&s;es his manner of life for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Honoured with a military po&s;t, as &s;oon as he was able to enjoy it, Dorantes was introduced to Lucinda; her hou&s;e was the receptacle for all tho&s;e that were de&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rous of &s;tudying the <HI>ta&s;te</HI> of the day, to &s;eize the fa&s;hion of the moment, or figure in the art of plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of &s;ubmitting to the general <HI>to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> Do|rantes, would not adopt it till he had &s;een how it would take for one month, which was the way of never &s;ubmitting to it.</P>
<P>To brave the torrent of fa&s;hion, to make it the &s;ubject of &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tire, is mere &s;ingularity and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">olly: though the per&s;on who does this may be laugh|ed at, yet he is excu&s;ed.</P>
<P>What the world could not forgive in him, was

his ob&s;tinacy in his &s;entiments, and the po&s;itive manner in which he defended them again&s;t his &s;uperiors, I mean tho&s;e who had gained an a&s;|cendency in &s;ociety.</P>
<P>This pertinaciou&s;ne&s;s may &s;ometimes be found in the company of truth; but yet it is no proof of it: for error has had its martyrs. Do|rantes never quitted an opinion which he had adopted. Per&s;ons of &s;uch a temper may at fir&s;t be &s;incere, and though afterwards they are un|deceived, yet their vanity will not &s;uffer them to confe&s;s it.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who were in the right in their di&s;putes with Dorantes, co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ented them&s;elves with ban|tering him on account of his oddities; for &s;upe|riority is indulgent. Tho&s;e who were in an er|ror, and were for de&s;troying the veil of error in his company, were not quite &s;o ea&s;y; on which account he was frequently engaged in &s;ome af|fair of honour.</P>
<P>For in&s;tance, he broke with Medor, one of his friends, only becau&s;e he had not &s;o high an opinion as him&s;elf, of an eminent actor. Do|rantes grew warm, and they drew their &s;words; the engagement was not a very bloody one, they came off &s;lightly wounded but yet, it might have been attended with more fatal con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Though they &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ove to bury their duel in ob|livion, yet we know that &s;ecrets of this nature cannot be kept from the knowledge of our ac|quaintance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> news is &s;pread with a &s;ingle hint, and the world is &s;oon in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them.</P>
<P>The blame was univer&s;ally <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aid upon Doran|tes. Lucinda was affected with it. "It is a pity, &s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf, that a man of honour, and one whom I have entered into my li&s;t,

<P>This propo&s;al was agreeable to her wi&s;hes&punc; Lucinda could not have made a better choice.

<P>It was by this &s;ecret charm that Cloe acquir|ed an a&s;cendency over Dorantes; &s;ubdued by her graces, he thought that he yielded only to her arguments.</P>
<P>As it is impo&s;&s;ible to draw the character of Cloe to perfection, I &s;hall only add that her beauty was the only &s;ubject of di&s;cour&s;e among the other &s;ex, and that her good friends among the ladies, could find but one defect in her; though her rivals thought &s;he had <HI>two.</HI> "Her eyes, &s;aid the latter, are expre&s;&s;ive of tenderne&s;s, when they ought to expre&s;s indifference; and the colouring of her complexion has too near a re&s;emblance to that of art, on account of its be|ing too glaring."</P>
<P>Cloe &s;oon received a vi&s;it from Dorantes: he endeavoured to efface, by his pre&s;ence, the re|ports which had been &s;pread of his duel. "What here already! cried &s;he; you have very little value for your health."&mdash;"My health! repli|ed he; I do not under&s;tand you."&mdash;"Do|rantes, re&s;umed Cloe, none of your eva&s;ions; pre&s;erve your ingenuou&s;ne&s;s, e&s;pecially as it will not become <HI>ob&s;tinacy,</HI> which is a great thing in your favour." "Well, an&s;wered Dorantes, I will confe&s;s. I have had <HI>an affair</HI>; yet I was

but &s;lightly wounded; will you blame me for &s;hewing that I did not want for courage. It is the inheritance of tho&s;e who are in the army." "It may be &s;o, &s;aid &s;he, but politene&s;s is their inheritance likewi&s;e. What was the cau&s;e of the rupture between you and Medor? You admired the expre&s;&s;ion, the fire, and &s;en&s;ibility of&mdash;the actor, and I cannot but &s;ay I have the higher opinion of your ta&s;te for doing &s;o. Medor who is more phlegmatic than you, admires him with|out enthu&s;ia&s;m; in the name of good &s;en&s;e was there any rea&s;on for your falling into a pa&s;&s;ion on that account? Dorantes, your confu&s;ion and &s;ilence &s;hew that you <HI>are &s;orry for it.</HI>" "Ma|dam, an&s;wered he, they only &s;hew my <HI>a&s;toni&s;h|ment</HI>; I could not have imagined that valour would appear as a crime in your eyes." "I have told you, replied &s;he bri&s;kly, that I have no objection to valour; I only object to the abu&s;e of it; blood &s;hould never be drawn in a di&s;pute on <HI>ta&s;te.</HI> Repair your fault. &mdash;You may do it without any prejudice to your character. Con|fe&s;s to Medor that you attacked him without grounds or rea&s;on." "What would you have me do? cried Dorantes. No, I &s;hall not di&s;|honour my&s;elf. A conce&s;&s;ion of that nature would only expo&s;e me to fre&s;h in&s;ults.&mdash;Perhaps I may have been in the wrong. Ah Madam, what an expre&s;&s;ion have you extorted from me!" This kind of confe&s;&s;ion was all that Cloe could draw from him; and he was &s;orry that he had made it.</P>
<P>We are very partial to our&s;elves, and are of|fended with tho&s;e who do not flatter our preju|dices. Hence Cloe di&s;plea&s;ed Dorantes by the very circum&s;tance which ought to have increa&s;ed
<PB N="51" REF="046224_0050_1020FD44B84B8F60">
his love. "She cen&s;ures my conduct, which is a &s;ure token that it is worthy of e&s;teem: for nothing but what is intrinfically valuable is deemed a proper object for critici&s;m. Well I &s;hall leave the&s;e cen&s;urers to them&s;elves, and I am de|termined to begin with Cloe, &s;he is like others carried away by the &s;tream of vulgar errors, and ready to give her &s;anction to every thing that is in fa&s;hion; &s;he may indeed have too much &s;en&s;e to differ from me in opinion&mdash;but &s;he &s;eems at pre&s;ent only to flatter tho&s;e that are my enemies."</P>
<P>To renounce our pre&s;ent connections is to re|duce our&s;elves to the nece&s;&s;ity of contracting new ones: Dorantes experienced the truth of this ob|&s;ervation. A character like his, and an opulent fortune, open a favourable pro&s;pect to tho&s;e who &s;trive to extricate them&s;elves from their difficul|ties by their officiou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;ub&s;titute the mo&s;t &s;ervile compliances and intrigue, in the &s;tead of hone&s;t labour for their &s;upport.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e with which he was &s;urrounded, no one &s;urpa&s;&s;ed Damis in <HI>fine&s;&s;e.</HI> Employed ince&s;&s;antly in developing the foibles of humani|ty, attentive to their motions, their conver&s;a|tion, and their looks, he turned all the light he acquired to his own advantage. Per&s;ons of a po&s;itive di&s;po&s;ition are fond of applau&s;e; this was the in&s;trument which Damis availed him&s;elf of; far from oppo&s;ing his opinions to tho&s;e of Dorantes, he cried up their &s;ublimity, and rever|enced them as much as a critic does one of the Greek or Roman cla&s;&s;ics.</P>
<P>At the fir&s;t &s;haft of flattery Dorantes was &s;hock|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> where is there a man who can re&s;i&s;t the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> heart becomes an accomplice to

betray us, and if we a&s;pire at public applau&s;e, we are in part &s;educed.</P>
<P>To di&s;pute every inch of ground with addre&s;s; to oppo&s;e or comply with the public ta&s;te, was the artifice which Damis employed on this oc|ca&s;ion. "I mu&s;t bring you acquainted with a young lady from the country, who&s;e relations have committed her to my care," &s;aid he to Do|rantes; and he added, "&s;he is tolerably hand|&s;ome, you &s;hall form her, and be her in&s;tructor."</P>
<P>Dorantes, prejudiced in favour of Clarinda's character, perceived nothing but &s;implicity, where others would have di&s;covered <HI>fine&s;&s;e,</HI> and was inchanted with her per&s;on, which he had given them but a faint de&s;cription of.</P>
<P>Not that her per&s;on was equal to that of Cloe's, but there is a great deal of partiality blended with the judgment we make of beauty. We frequently depreciate in private tho&s;e charms which others applaud with the greate&s;t warmth, and commonly fall a victim to tho&s;e which others pa&s;s by unnoticed. Were it not for this oppo|&s;ition from partiality to the general ta&s;te, two or three per&s;ons would ingro&s;s every one's ado|ration, and the major part of the &s;ex would not have a &s;ingle heart left for them.</P>
<P>Be this as it may, the affection of Dorantes fluctuated between the two Belies; but when he found him&s;elf applauded by Clarinda, when he contra&s;ted the captivating notes of ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">iation with the gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing &s;ounds of reproof, it admits of no doubt to which he gave the preference. A &s;iren obtained the prize which he refu&s;ed to wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>Clarinda ea&s;ily got the a&s;cendancy over him, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ded her de&s;igns upon him&punc; At fir&s;t

<P>Clarinda had two difficulties to &s;truggle with; her poverty, which is a very great ob&s;tacle in the&s;e days; but that was nothing in compari&s;on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ith the whi&s;pers which were &s;pread again&s;t her character.

<P>After having given an unfavourable picture of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e who were not her friends, Clarinda's
<PB N="54" REF="046224_0053_1020FD4F120A9760">
grand &s;ecret was to in&s;pire her lover with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i|king of mode&s;t and di&s;creet appearances, and to feed his love by little liberties. To &s;ecure the former &s;he made choice of tho&s;e &s;ituations where a per&s;on may ri&s;k every thing without too much ra&s;hne&s;s; to procure the other, &s;he tempered by her di&s;cour&s;es, the ardor which &s;he had excited? &s;he made him contented in re|ceiving &s;mall favours, by giving him a pro&s;pect of obtaining &s;till greater; thus at the &s;ame time as &s;he inflamed his de&s;ires, &s;he chained them with hope; and from the whole of her conduct &s;he was able both to keep his love alive, and to pre&s;erve his e&s;teem.</P>
<P>Dorantes would readily have propo&s;ed mar|riage, had it not been for the exce&s;&s;ive precau|tions of Clarinda. But &s;he had painted man|kind in &s;o di&s;agreeable an attitude, that he was afraid to furni&s;h new victims, and add to the number of dupes; or the bad.</P>
<P>However, to ha&s;ten the cata&s;trophe, Clarinda changed her battery. She became re&s;erved and &s;crupulous. She never received Dorantes without lamenting the force of the pa&s;&s;ion by which &s;he was attached to him. She a&s;&s;umed an external appearance of devotion; and after having prepared him by the&s;e artifices, &s;he de|clared that her virtue, honour, con&s;cience, and the advice of per&s;ons of the greate&s;t piety, obli|ged her to take refuge in one of tho&s;e a&s;ylums of innocence, wherein that time is dedicated to prayer, which others dedicate to plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Dorantes entreated, conjured, made a hun|dred prote&s;tations of affection, and concluded with a promi&s;e of leading her to the altar.</P>
<P>If Clarinda had not con&s;ented, if &s;he would
<PB N="55" REF="046224_0054_1020FD51A49D5638">
have applied for a <HI>licence</HI> which would not have been refu&s;ed her, in&s;tead of bands, nothing could have added to her triumph. But &s;he em|ployed that time in affected delicacy, which ought to have been employed in a more mate|rial affair&punc; and &s;he let fortune &s;lip out of her hands, while &s;he was contemplating it.</P>
<P>This news was not long in &s;preading all over the place. Dorantes's former friends, &s;hocked at an example which might have a contagious influence, endeavoured to di&s;&s;uade him from the match.</P>
<P>This was no proper time for truth to be heard; always prejudiced with his own ideas, he &s;hut his heart to her whi&s;pers; he was approaching towards a precipice; his feet tottered upon the brink of an aby&s;s.</P>
<P>Dorantes, now became the je&s;t of the town, and valuing him&s;elf more for that very rea&s;on, was to have been married in a week's time. Happily for him, Clarinda, who was near the end of her labours, and held the palm in her hand, grew tired of a di&s;&s;imulation which ap|peared of no farther u&s;e, and which is always difficult to &s;upport. Dorantes &s;aw, as well as the re&s;t of the town, that he was her dupe, and that &s;he treated him more like a hu&s;band than a lover.</P>
<P>It may be thought incredible, that &s;he could not have held out one week longer. They who think &s;o, forget conque&s;t infatuates, and that no one is nearer a fall, than he who has arrived at the &s;ummit of grandeur; but even they &s;hould have rea&s;on on their &s;ide, yet I cannot &s;acrifice the truth of hi&s;tory to the fal&s;e delicacy o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the age.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="046224_0055_1020FD54619EF6D0">This alteration in Clarinda's behaviour re|moved the bandage from the eyes of Dorantes. He compared what he &s;aw now, to what he had &s;een, and to what he had heard. Scarcely a|waked from a long lethargy, and freed from il|lu&s;ion, he had recour&s;e to his friends and owned for once in his life, that advice was nece&s;&s;ary. Truth, which had been long &s;mothered bur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t out on all &s;ides, and the unhappy lover was en|tertained with &s;everal anecdotes from the <HI>Scan|dalous Chronicle.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall not attempt to de&s;cribe his feelings, Tho&s;e who have experienced &s;uch di&s;agreeable &s;ituations, can conceive them well enough, while others cannot form any idea of them. The image of Cloe revived in his imagination; he thought he had offended her too gro&s;sly, to re|cover her e&s;teem, or expect her forgivene&s;s. Fluctuating thus between love, which attracted him to her, and &s;hame, which kept him at a di&s;tance from her, he was informed that &s;he was gone off with another man. The manner in which this event was de&s;cribed, was &s;omewhat remarkable. The ladies who gave this infor|mation were no great friends to Cloe, becau&s;e &s;he eclip&s;ed them. They &s;aid, "they &s;aw her by her&s;elf in a lone&s;ome place; after which they &s;aw a gentleman acco&s;t her, who led her away." All this was true; but they &s;hould have added, that Cloe pro&s;trated her&s;elf at the gentleman's feet and was bathed in tears. But the eye of jealou&s;y can perceive nothing but what flatters its wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>When this anecdote tran&s;pired, Cloe was vindicated by &s;ome; others &s;aid, that this event gave them no &s;urprize, as it was &s;uitable to her
<PB N="57" REF="046224_0056_1020FD55EBD315F0">
character, and &s;ome, who were more bold, &s;aid they fore&s;aw it. Dorantes was determined to &s;earch this affair to the bottom, and to &s;natch Cloe from her troubles; for her virtue was ne|ver &s;u&s;pected by him. But he knew not what cour&s;e to take. After many a tedious enquiry, he di&s;covered that a ve&s;&s;el had lately failed from Dieppe, for the i&s;land of Jer&s;ey, having on board a young lady who was very hand&s;ome; who no one was permitted to &s;ee, and that &s;he was a prey to grief. With this glimp&s;e of light, he &s;et out; no &s;acrifices are too great to one who would be a protector of female honour, and is de&s;irous of delivering his mi&s;tre&s;s, and meriting her love. He landed. Heavens! what a &s;ight! He met Medor conducting Cloe to church.</P>
<P>"Conde&s;cend, &s;aid Medor to him, to be pre|&s;ent at the union of two lovers, who are going to vow an ince&s;&s;ant fidelity to each other." The prie&s;t was ready, and going to begin the ceremony, when Cloe cried&mdash;"Stop! Stop! do not be guilty of &s;acrilege; deliver me from his impious hands! Oh, deliver me!"&mdash; At this cri&s;is Dorantes di&s;covered him&s;elf; the thunderbolt which &s;trikes a per&s;on dead in the middle of a fea&s;t, could not cau&s;e a greater a&s;toni&s;hment. Cloe alarmed at this interpo&s;i|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion, uttered many an exclamation of joy.

The chagrin which he had occa&s;ioned, was eclip&s;ed by the important &s;ervice he had ren|dered her.

<P>I am the &s;on of a younger brother of a good family, who at his decea&s;e left me a little for|tune of a hundred pounds a year. I was put early to Eton &s;chool, where I learnt Latin and Greek, from whence I went to the univer&s;ity, where I learnt&mdash;not totally to forget them. I came to my fortune while I was at college; and having no inclination to follow any profe&s;|&s;ion, I removed my&s;elf to town, and lived for &s;ome time as mo&s;t young gentleman do, by &s;pending four times my income. But it was my happine&s;s, before it was too late, to fall in love,
<PB N="59" REF="046224_0058_1020FD5CAF36C2F0">
and to marry a very amiable young creature, who&s;e fortune was ju&s;t &s;ufficient to repair the breach made in my own. With this agreeable companion I retreated to the country, and en|deavoured as well as I was able to &s;quare my wi&s;hes to my circum&s;tances. In this endeavour I &s;ucceeded &s;o well, that except a few private hankerings after a little more than I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and now and then a &s;igh when a coach and &s;ix happened to drive by me in my walks, I was a very happy man.</P>
<P>I can truly a&s;&s;ure you, that though our family economy was not much to be boa&s;ted of, and, in con&s;equence of it, we were frequently driven to great &s;traits and difficulties, I experienced more real &s;atisfaction in this humble &s;ituation, than I have ever done &s;ince in more enviable circum|&s;tances. We were &s;ometimes indeed a little in debt, but when money came in, the plea&s;ure of di&s;charging what we owed was more than equi|valent for the pain it put us to; and though the narrowne&s;s of our circum&s;tances &s;ubjected us to many cares &amp; anxieties, it &s;erved to keep the body <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n action as well as the mind: for as our garden was &s;omewhat large, and required more hands to keep it in order than we could afford to hire, we laboured daily in it our&s;elves, and drew health from our nece&s;&s;ities.</P>
<P>I had a little boy who was the delight of my heart, and who probably, might have been &s;poilt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y nur&s;ing, if the attention of his parents had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ot been otherwi&s;e employed.

Or even in the happie&s;t &s;itua|tion, in the mid&s;t of ea&s;e, health, and affluence, the mind is generally ingenious at tormenting it&s;elf, lo&s;ing the immediate enjoyment of tho&s;e invaluable ble&s;&s;ings by the painful &s;ugge&s;tion that they are too great for continuance.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the reflections that I have made &s;ince: for I do not attempt to deny that I &s;igh|ed frequently for an addition to my fortune. The death of a di&s;tant relation, which happened five years after our marriage, gave me this addition, and made me for a time the happie&s;t man liv|ing. My income was now increa&s;ed to &s;ix hun|dred a year; and I hoped, with a little econo|my, to be able to make a figure with it. But the ill health of my wife, which in le&s;s ea&s;y cir|cum&s;tances had not touched me &s;o nearly, was now con&s;tantly in my thoughts, and &s;oured all my enjoyments. The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s too of hav|ing &s;uch an e&s;tate to leave my boy made me &s;o anxious to pre&s;erve him, that in&s;tead of &s;uffering him to run at plea&s;ure where he plea&s;ed, and to grow hardy by exerci&s;e, I almo&s;t de&s;troyed him by confinement.

prudence to fore&s;ee nor courage to prevent. For as it enabled us to extend the circuit of our vi&s;its, it greatly increa&s;ed our acquaintance, and &s;ubjected us to the nece&s;&s;ity of making continual entertainments at home, in return for all tho&s;e which we were invited to abroad. The charges that attended this new manner of living were much too great for the income we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in|&s;omuch that we found our&s;elves in a very &s;hort time more nece&s;&s;itous than ever. Pride would not &s;uffer us to lay down our equipage; and to live in a manner un&s;uitable to it was what we could not bear to think of. To pay the debts I had contracted I was &s;oon forced to mortgage, and at la&s;t to &s;ell the be&s;t part of my e&s;tate; and as it was utterly impo&s;&s;ible to keep up the parade any longer, we thought it advi&s;able to remove of a &s;udden, to &s;ell our coach in town, and to look out for a new &s;ituation at a great di&s;tance from our acquaintance.</P>
<P>But unfortunately for my peace, I carried the habit of expen&s;e along with me, and was very near being reduced to ab&s;olute want, when, by the unexpected death of an uncle and his two &s;ons, who died within a few weeks of each other, I &s;ucceeded to an e&s;tate of &s;even thou&s;and pounds a year.</P>
<P>And now, both you and your readers will un|doubtedly call me a very happy man: and &s;o indeed I was. I &s;et about the regulation of my family with the mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;atisfaction. The &s;plendour of my equipages, the magnificence of my plate, the crowd of &s;ervants that attended me, the elegance of my hou&s;e and furniture, the grandeur of my park and gardens, the luxury of my table, and the court that was every where
<PB N="62" REF="046224_0061_1020FD62D5410270">
paid me, gave me inexpre&s;&s;ible delight, &s;o long as they were novelties; but no &s;ooner were they become habitual to me than I lo&s;t all manner of reli&s;h for them; and I di&s;covered, in a very lit|tle time, that by having nothing to wi&s;h for, I had nothing to enjoy. My appetite grew pallid by &s;atiety, a perpetual crowd of vi&s;itors robbed me of all dome&s;tic enjoyment, my &s;ervants pla|gued me, and my &s;teward cheated me.</P>
<P>But the cur&s;e of greatne&s;s did not end here. Daily experience convinced me that I was com|pelled to live more for others than my&s;elf. My uncle had been a great party man, and a zea|lous oppo&s;er of all mini&s;terial mea&s;ures; and as his e&s;tate was the large&s;t of any gentleman's in the country, he &s;upported an intere&s;t in it beyond any of his competitors. My father had been greatly obliged by the court party, which determined me in gratitude to declare my&s;elf on that &s;ide; but the difficulties I had to en|counter were too many and to great for me; in|&s;omuch that I have been baffled and defeated in almo&s;t every thing I have undertaken. To de&s;ert the cau&s;e I have embarked in would di&s;|grace me, and to go greater lengths in it would undo me. I am engaged in a perpetual &s;tate of warfare with the principal gentry of the county, and am cur&s;ed by my tenants and de|pendants for compelling them at every election to vote (as they are plea&s;ed to tell me) contra|ry to their con&s;cience.</P>

<P>This, Sir, is my hi&s;tory; and if you give it a place in your paper, it may &s;erve to inculcate this important truth, that where pain, &s;ickne&s;s, and ab&s;olute want, are out of the que&s;tion, no external change of circum&s;tances can make a man more la&s;tingly happy than he was before. It is to an ignorance of this truth that the uni|ver&s;al di&s;&s;atisfaction of mankind is principally to be a&s;cribed.

<HEAD>Hi&s;tory of Sir HARRY PRIGG.</HEAD>
<P>NOT long &s;ince, I met at St. James's cof|fee-hou&s;e an old acquaintance of mine&punc; Sir Harry Prigg; who having been long ru&s;ti|cated,
<PB N="64" REF="046224_0063_1020FD6BC395EC48">
and much altered, I &s;hould never have recollected, had it not been for the information of a fine old coat, in which I remembered him to have made a figure about town many years ago. After the u&s;ual civilities had pa&s;&s;ed be|tween us, among&s;t many other que&s;tions, he a&s;ked me when I had &s;een our old &s;chool fellow, Sir John Jolly. I an&s;wered, that I had la&s;t &s;ummer &s;pent &s;ome days with him at his country &s;eat, in a manner which would have been high|ly agreeable to a per&s;on of more fa&s;hionable turn, but was to me rather fatiguing, from its exce&s;s of gaiety and ho&s;pitality, which, accor|ding to my unpolite ta&s;te, were by no means con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;oft and &s;erious plea&s;ures of a rural retirement. He &s;aid, he perfectly a|greed with me in my &s;entiments, and pa&s;&s;ed his time in the country in conformity to them: his manner of life, he was &s;ure, would exactly &s;uit me, and obligingly begged I would make the experiment, adding, that he &s;hould go down in a few days, and would carry me with him in his chariot. I accepted his invitation, not &s;o much out of inclination as curio&s;ity to &s;ee a new &s;cene of country life, formed on princi|ples &s;o oppo&s;ite to what I had before experi|enced, and promi&s;ed to attend him at the time appointed.</P>
<P>But, fir&s;t, it will be proper to give &s;ome ac|count of the birth, parentage, and education of my friend. He came young to his title and a &s;mall e&s;tate, and was &s;oon after &s;ent to the uni|ver&s;ity; where his title ab&s;urdly giving him the rat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ility, and his e&s;tate, though &s;mall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> an allowance &s;ufficient to &s;upport that rank at that place, he there contracted an af+fectation

of grandeur, and a pert kind of &s;elf-im|portance, which he has ever &s;ince retained, and which neither poverty nor &s;olitude has been yet able to conquer. Having in two or three years acquired the advantages of that &s;ort of education, &s;uch as the arts of &s;porting, toa&s;ting, billiards, and coach-man&s;hip, he came to London, enter|ed into the gay world, and had addre&s;s and qualifications &s;ufficient to introduce him&s;elf in|to what he &s;till calls the be&s;t company; that is, the company of &s;marts, bucks, jockeys, and game&s;ters: nor was he deficient in point of gal|lantry; for he &s;oon commenced an intrigue with the &s;i&s;ter of one of the&s;e his friends. Whether his intentions were at fir&s;t honourable is not perfectly clear; but he was quickly obliged to declare them &s;o, being acquainted, that a lady of her rank was not to be trifled with, and that he mu&s;t either fight or marry! the latter of which he courageou&s;ly cho&s;e, as being the mo&s;t daring action of the two. This lady had more gentility than beauty, more beauty than under|&s;tanding, more under&s;tanding than fortune, and a fortune about equal to her reputation. She was tall and well-&s;haped, carried her head very high, and, being the younger daughter of the younger &s;on of the fir&s;t cou&s;in of an Iri&s;h baron, looked upon her&s;elf as a woman of quality. In a little time Sir Harry heartily ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed her for compelling him to marry, and &s;he no le&s;s de&s;|pi&s;ed him for being compell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d: &s;o th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t finding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ittle happine&s;s at home, they were obliged to &s;eek it abro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d at prays and r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, operas and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ming tables, at no &s;mall expen&s;e.

town air would not agree with them, and &s;o re|tired to their country &s;eat, about forty miles from London; whither I &s;hall now conduct my reader.</P>
<P>On the morning appointed I attended early at their lodgings in town, where I found the po&s;t chariot at the door, and my friend &s;tanding by it, with a long whip in his hand, ready to mount the box; &s;aying, at the &s;ame time, that coach-men were &s;uch in&s;olent and expen&s;ive ra&s;cals there was no keeping them; and that therefore he always cho&s;e to be his own. In the parlour &s;at my lady, and colonel Mac&s;hane; a gentle|man who had long been very intimate with Sir Harry, and not le&s;s &s;o with her lady&s;hip; and in the pa&s;&s;age &s;tood her French woman, in a &s;ack and long ruffles, with her arms full of band-boxes and bundles; which were no &s;ooner di&s;|po&s;ed of in various parts of the chariot, than my lady and my&s;elf, with her woman on a low &s;tool at our feet, were &s;tuffed into the little room that was left. Sir Harry mounted the box, his valet de chambre rode by, and a &s;niveling foot-boy climbed up behind. Thus the whole fami|ly, with their baggage, and my&s;elf into the bar|gain, were conveyed without the expen&s;e of ei|ther a &s;tage-coach or a waggon.</P>
<P>Nothing pa&s;&s;ed during our journey worth re|lating. Her lady&s;hip &s;poke little, and that lit|tle was only complaints of her bad nerves and her ill &s;tate of health; to which, having no ex|pectation of a fee, I paid little attention. They both declared that nobody but a carrier could dine at an inn, therefore they never &s;topped on the road; &s;o with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a fre&s;h pair of hor&s;es, that had come twenty miles that

morning without a bait, about &s;un-&s;et we arriv|ed at our journey's end. The colonel got there before us, having rode po&s;t: for Sir Harry fre|quently declared to us both, that though his friends were welcome, he never entertained their hor&s;es; that it was not the fa&s;hion in that coun|try; neither my Lord &mdash;, nor the Duke of &mdash;, nor him&s;elf, did it.</P>
<P>It was not long before the dinner made its appearance; which was &s;o very genteel, that had it not been rendered uneatable by a bad af|fectation of French cookery, it would not have been half &s;ufficient, after &s;o many miles travel|ling, and &s;o long fa&s;ting. At the conclu&s;ion, we had mead, which pa&s;&s;ed for to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay; and el|der wine, which Sir Harry &s;wore was the be&s;t Burgundy in England, and that he him&s;elf had imported it, in conjunction with a noble lord in the neighbourhood. Over a gla&s;s of this, the cloth being removed, he informed us that when the &s;moke of London, and the bad hours inci|dent to keeping good company, would no long|er agree with his own or his wife's con&s;titution, he had determined to &s;eek health and quiet in an elegant retirement. He had been offered, indeed, a &s;eat in parliament, and a con&s;iderable employment; but his crazy con&s;titution would not permit him to accept of the one, nor his &s;ound principles of the other.&mdash; Retirement was their object, therefore all they dreaded was the horrible irruptions of a country neighbourhood&punc; but this they had happily prevented.&mdash;That in|deed, on their fir&s;t coming, every family within ten miles round tormented them with their im|pertinent vi&s;its; but they returned none, af|fronted them all, and &s;o got rid of them.

you think we did right, my dear? turning to his wife. I think, an&s;wered &s;he, in a &s;urly and dejected voice, that it is better to forget the u&s;e of one's tongue than to conver&s;e with &s;quires' wives and par&s;ons' daughters. You are right, Madam, added the Colonel, with an oath and a loud laugh; for what can one learn in &s;uch company? To-morrow, &s;ays my friend, ad|dre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me, you &s;hall &s;ee that we want no company, and that we can &s;ufficiently amu&s;e our&s;elves with building and planting, with im|provements and alterations, which I dare &s;ay will be honoured with your approbation.</P>
<P>Accordingly the next morning, as &s;oon as breakfa&s;t was fini&s;hed, my lady and the Colonel retired into her dre&s;&s;ing room to cribbage, and Sir Harry and my&s;elf to reconnoitre the place. The hou&s;e &s;tands at the end of a dirty village, and clo&s;e by it are a few tame deer impounded in an orchard, to which he gives the pompous title of a park. Behind is a fen, which he calls a piece of water, and before it a goo&s;e common, on which he be&s;tows the name of a lawn. It was built in that deplorable aera of Engli&s;h ar|chitecture, which introduced high doors, long windows, &s;mall rooms, and corner chimnies; and of gardening, which projected gravel walks, clipt yews, and &s;trait lined avenues, with a pro|fu&s;ion of brick walls, iron palli&s;adoes, and leaden images. But all the&s;e defects, and many others, he has now corrected by a judicious application of modern ta&s;te. His doors are reduced, you cannot enter with your hat on; and his windows &s;o contracted, that you have &s;carce light enough to find it if you will pull it off.

I began now to wi&s;h for a little of my friend Sir John's ho&s;pitality, of which there was not here the lea&s;t appearance. We heard not of a human creature, except by their inju|ries and in&s;ults, not altogether indeed unpro|voked; for the pantry and the cellar, though u&s;ually empty, were always locked. Strong beer there was none; and the &s;mall, though no body at home could drink it, was not &s;uffered to be given away. The &s;ervants were always out of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">umour, and frequently changing; and the trade&s;men who brought their bills were paid only by a wrangle, or a draught on &s;ome tenant who owed no rent. There was not a neighbor near, except the par&s;on of the pari&s;h, and Alder|man Grab, a rich citizen, who had purcha&s;ed a con&s;iderable part of it from Sir Harry. With the&s;e they lived in a &s;tate of perpetual ho&s;tili|ties: they quarrelled with the alderman for pre|&s;uming to buy an e&s;tate which they wanted to &s;ell&punc; and the par&s;on quarrelled with them be|cau&s;e he was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the only living in the gift of Sir Harry and the alderman had a much better to di&s;po&s;e of.

<HEAD>Hi&s;tory of Sir JOHN JOLLY.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING been frequently pre&s;&s;ed by Sir John Jolly (an old friend of mine, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;ine e&s;tate, a large park, and a plen|tiful fortune) to pa&s;s a few weeks with him in the country, I determined la&s;t autumn to accept his invitation, propo&s;ing to my&s;elf the highe&s;t plea&s;ure from changing the noi&s;e and hurry of this bu&s;tling metropolis for the agreeable &s;ilence and &s;oothing indolence of a rural retirement. I accordingly &s;et out one morning, and pretty early the next arrived at the habitation of my friend, &s;ituated in a mo&s;t delicious and roman|tic &s;pot, which (the owner having fortunately no ta&s;te) is not yet defaced with improvements. On my approach I abated a little of my tra|velling pace, to look round me, and admire the towering hills and fertile vales, the wind|ing &s;treams, the &s;tately woods and &s;pacious
<PB N="72" REF="046224_0071_1020FD7F1FDC4000">
lawns, which, gilded by the &s;un&s;hine of a beau|tiful morning, on every &s;ide afforded a mo&s;t en|chanting pro&s;pect&punc; and I plea&s;ed my&s;elf with the thoughts of the happy hours I &s;hould &s;pend amid&s;t the&s;e pa&s;toral &s;cenes, in reading, in me|ditation, or in &s;oft repo&s;e, in&s;pired by the low|ing of di&s;tant herds, the fall of waters, and the melody of birds.</P>
<P>I was received with a hearty welcome, and many &s;hakes by the hand, by my old friend, whom I had not &s;een for many years, except once, when he was called to town, by a pro&s;e|cution in the King's Bench, for mi&s;under&s;tand|ing the &s;en&s;e of an act of parliament, which on examination, was found to be non&s;en&s;e. He is an hone&s;t gentleman, of a middle age, a hale con&s;titution, good natural parts, and abundant &s;pirits, a keen &s;port&s;man, an active magi&s;trate, and a tolerable farmer, not without &s;ome ambi|tion of acquiring a &s;eat in parliament by his in|tere&s;t in a neighbouring borough: &s;o that be|tween his pur&s;uits of game, of ju&s;tice, and po|pularity, be&s;ides the management of a large quantity of land, which he keeps in his own hands, as he terms it, for amu&s;ement, every moment of his time is &s;ufficiently employed. His wife is an agreeable woman, of about the &s;ame age, and has been hand&s;ome; but though years have &s;omewhat impaired her charms, they have not in the lea&s;t, her reli&s;h for company, cards, balls, and all other manner of public di|ver&s;ions.</P>
<P>On my arrival, I was fir&s;t conducted into the breakfa&s;t-room, which, with &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e, I &s;aw quite filled with genteel per&s;ons of both &s;ex|es in di&s;habille, with their hair in papers; the

cau&s;e of which I was quickly informed of, by the many apologies of my lady for the mea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+ne&s;s of the apartment &s;he was obliged to allot me, by rea&s;on "the hou&s;e was &s;o crouded with company during the time of their races, which, &s;he &s;aid, began that very day for the whole week, and for which they were immediately prepar|ing." I was in&s;tantly attacked by all pre&s;ent with one voice, or rather with many voices at the &s;ame time, to accompany them thither; to which I made no oppo&s;ition, thinking it would be attended with more trouble than the expe|dition it&s;elf.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the ladies and equipages were ready we i&s;&s;ued forth in a mo&s;t magnificent ca|valcade; and after travelling five or &s;ix miles through bad roads, we arrived at the Red Lion, ju&s;t as the ordinary was making its appearance on the table. The ceremonials of this &s;ump|tuous entertainment, which con&s;i&s;ted of cold fi&s;h, lean chickens, ru&s;ty hams, raw veni&s;on, &s;tale game, green fruit, and grapele&s;s wines, de|&s;troyed at lea&s;t two hours, with five times that number of heads, ruffles, and &s;uits of clothes, by the unfortunate effu&s;ion of butter and gravy. From hence we proceeded a few miles farther to the race ground, where nothing, I think, ex|traordinary happened but that, among&s;t much di&s;order and drunkenne&s;s, few limbs and no necks were broken: and from the&s;e, Olympic games, which, to the great emolument of pick|pockets, la&s;ted till it was dark, we galloped back to the town, through a &s;oaking &s;hower; to dre&s;s for the a&s;&s;embly. But this I found no ea&s;y ta&s;k; nor could I po&s;&s;ibly accompli&s;h it before my clothes were quite dried upon my back: my

in the end, it was agreed that we &s;hould &s;et out that very evening at &s;ix o'clock. He was punc|tual to his appointment, with a &s;ervant on hor&s;e|back, leading a hand&s;ome gelding for his ma&s;|ter, who with two young gentleman, his friends, were waiting for me at the inn. I could not help ob&s;erving, while the chai&s;e was getting ready, that the&s;e young gentlemen were taking a good deal of pains to &s;tifle a laugh, which, on our &s;tep|ping into the carriage, they were no longer able to contain: but I made no remarks upon their behaviour, and we &s;et out upon our journey.</P>
<P>We reached Ware that night, without any thing happening worthy of remark, except that we were &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pt upon the road by two young gen|tlemen on hor&s;eback, and interrupted in a very &s;erious conver&s;ation by their &s;aluting my com|panion with

My fellow traveller gave them a look of con|tempt, and after a&s;&s;uring them that he had not the honour of knowing them, and pulling up the gla&s;s, ordered the po&s;&s;ition to drive on.</P>
<P>Our evening at Ware was &s;pent in remark<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> on the di&s;&s;olutene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s of the times, and the inde|cent liberties that wild and pro&s;tigate young fel|lows were every where taking with the clergy. After much &s;er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> di&s;cour&s;e, and moderate re|fre&s;hment, we retired to re&s;t. I &s;lept longer than u&s;ual in the morning, and no &s;ooner was I awake than I di&s;covered, with equal confu&s;ion and &s;urpri&s;e, that I was in bed with a woman who, as I attempted to get up, threw her arm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> about my neck, and compelled me to lie down. The &s;truggle and the noi&s;e I made upon this oc|ca&s;ion, together with the &s;creams of the woman,
<PB N="82" REF="046224_0081_1020FD96E71F7CD8">
who &s;till held me fa&s;t, alarmed the whole inn, and drew a crowd of &s;pectators into the room headed by my companion, and followed by a &s;ol|dier, who owned him&s;elf the hu&s;band of the wo|man, &s;wearing that he would have my heart's blood for currupting the cha&s;tity of his wife. I pleaded my innocence to an unbelieving audi|ence, whil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the woman accu&s;ed me of having for|ced her again&s;t her will; pretending that it was her misfortune overnight to be a little in liquor, and that &s;he had mi&s;taken the room I lay in for her own.</P>
<P>To dwell no longer than is needful upon this di&s;graceful affair, I was in the end compelled to give a guinea to the &s;oldier, and afterwards to &s;ubmit with patience to the in&s;ults of a mob, who &s;urrounded the inn at our entrance into the po&s;t-chai&s;e, and followed it with hootings to the very extremity of the town.</P>
<P>From the pa&s;&s;ive behaviour of my companion at the inn, and the demure looks that he now put on, I began to harbour a &s;u&s;picion of him not greatly to his advantage: and while I was deliberating in what manner to addre&s;s him, an accident happened, which at once threw him off his guard, and di&s;covered to me, that in&s;tead of an agreeable companion I was travelling with a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">end. This accident was the &s;udden and vio|lent overturning of the po&s;t-chai&s;e; upon which occa&s;ion, though neither of us was hurt, he di&s;|charged &s;uch a volley of cur&s;es on the po&s;tillion as made me tremble to hear him. I endeavour|ed to pacify him by the gentle&s;t admonitions, which in&s;tead of calming his anger, turned it all upon my&s;elf; and amid&s;t a thou&s;and oaths and imprecations, he vowed revenge upon my head,
<PB N="83" REF="046224_0082_1020FD9977DD8380">
telling me that he hated a par&s;on as he hated Old Nic; that he had bribed the &s;oldier's whore to go to bed to me at the inn, and that he came out upon no other bu&s;ine&s;s than to play the devil with me all the way. I &s;tood agha&s;t at what I heard, and refu&s;ed getting into the chai&s;e again; upon which a &s;truggle en&s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, and blows pa&s;&s;ed between us; till by the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of his &s;ervant, and the knavery of the po&s;|tillion, whom he gained over to his &s;ide with a whole handful of &s;ilver, I was thru&s;t into the chai&s;e, and compelled to go on.</P>
<P>We had &s;carce travelled a mile before we over|took a couple of gyp&s;ies upon the road; one an old woman, the other a girl. They were all over rags and filth, and &s;o intoxicated with liquor that they reeled every &s;tep. My companion cal|led to the po&s;tillion to &s;top, and after que&s;tion|ing tho&s;e wretches about the way they were go|ing, got out of the chai&s;e, and told me that he could not in charity fit lolling at his ea&s;e while two of the tender &s;ex were walking barefoot on the road; and that if I had no weighty objec|tions he would make the old lady an offer of his &s;eat, and mi&s;s, as he was plea&s;ed to call her, might with great conveniency &s;it upon my knee. It was in vain fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> me to expo&s;tulate, or to at|tempt leaping after him: his &s;ervant held me fa&s;t by the arm, handed the creatures into the chai&s;e, and then mounting his hor&s;e, rode clo&s;e by its &s;ide, talking ob&s;cenity to the wretches, and in&s;tructing them to behave to me in a man|ner not to be endured nor de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>In this manner we pa&s;&s;ed through the villa|ges, and entered Roy&s;to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, the po&s;tillion being ordered to walk his hor&s;es gently to the inn,
<PB N="84" REF="046224_0083_1020FD9B10E3AB60">
that we might be followed by a mob whom my companion called to at every turning to &s;moke the par&s;on and his doxies.</P>
<P>I &s;tept from the chai&s;e amid&s;t the hallooing of the rabble and ran into the room, the door of which I locked. Here I determined to remain, or to fly to the magi&s;trate for protection had not my tormentor made his appearance at the win|dow, telling me, that as the joke was now at an end, and as he believed I had enough of an agree|able companion, he had altered his intention of vi|&s;iting Scotland, and &s;hould return to town that morning. I thanked him for the favour, but kept clo&s;e to my room, till I &s;aw him with his &s;ervant ride out of the inn, and take the road to London. I then ordered &s;ome refre&s;hm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt to be brought me, and a po&s;t chai&s;e to be in readi|ne&s;s; but how great was my a&s;toni&s;hment, when feeling for my pur&s;e, which contained forty gui|neas at my &s;etting out, I found that my pockets had been rifled and that I had not &s;o much as a bra&s;s farthing left me!</P>
<P>As it was no doubt with me, that the gyp&s;ies had robbed me, I made immediate inquiry after them, but learnt that they had di&s;appeared on our arrival at the inn; and though the mo&s;t di|ligent &s;earch was made for them, they were no where to be found.</P>
<P>It was now impo&s;&s;ible for me to proceed; I therefore determined to &s;tay where I was till I could receive a fre&s;h &s;upply from my wife, to whom I di&s;patched a me&s;&s;enger with a letter, &s;etting forth at large all the cruelties I had met with.</P>
<P>When the me&s;&s;enger was gone, it occurred to me, that however i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l my companion had u&s;ed

the vices of the human heart, it &s;hall be the object of this paper to examine this &s;trange in|verted entail of virtue and merit upwards, ac|cording to priority of birth, and &s;eniority of age. I &s;hall prove it to be forged, and con|&s;equently null and void to all intents and pur|po&s;es what&s;oever.</P>
<P>If I loved to jingle, I would &s;ay, that human nature has always been invariably the &s;ame, though always varying; that is, the &s;ame in &s;ub&s;tance, but varying in forms and modes, from many concurrent cau&s;es, of which, perhaps we know but few. Climate, education, acci|dents, &s;everally contribute to change tho&s;e modes; but in all climates, and in all ages, we di&s;cover through them the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions, affections, and appetites, and the &s;ame degree of virtues and vices.</P>
<P>This being unque&s;tionably the true &s;tate of the ca&s;e, which it would be endle&s;s to bring in|&s;tances to prove from the hi&s;tories of all times and of all nations, I &s;hall by the way of warn|ing to the incautious, and of reproof to the de|&s;igning, proceed to explain the rea&s;ons, which I have but ju&s;t hinted at above, why the human nature of the time being, has always been rec|koned the wor&s;t and mo&s;t degenerate.</P>
<P>Authors, e&s;pecially poets, though great men, are alas! but men; and like other men, &s;ubject to the weakne&s;&s;es of human nature, though per|haps, in a le&s;s degree: but it is however cer|tain, that their brea&s;ts are not ab&s;olutely &s;tran|gers to the pa&s;&s;ions of jealou&s;y, pride, and envy. Hence it is that they are very apt to mea&s;ure merit by the century, to love dead authors bet|ter than living ones, and to love them the better
<PB N="88" REF="046224_0087_1020FDA818BD5FC0">
the longer they have been dead. The Augu&s;tan age is therefore their favourite aera, being at lea&s;t &s;eventeen hundred years di&s;tant from the pre&s;ent. That Emperor was not only a judge of wit, but, for an emperor, a tolerable perfor|mer too; and Maecenas, his fir&s;t mini&s;ter, was both a patron and a poet: he not only encour|aged and protected, but fed and fattened men of wit at his own table, as appears from Horace: no &s;mall encouragement for panegyric. The&s;e were times indeed for genius to di&s;play it&s;elf in! It was honoured, ta&s;ted, and rewarded. But now&mdash;<HI>O <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">empora!

Anger and de&s;pair make them endeavour to lower that merit, which, till brought very low indeed, they are con&s;cious they cannot equal.</P>
<P>There is another and more numerous &s;et of much greater men, who &s;till more loudly com|plain of the ignorance, the corruption and the degeneracy of the pre&s;ent age. The&s;e are the con&s;ummate volunteers, but unregarded and un|rewarded politicians, who, at a mode&s;t compu|tation, amount to at lea&s;t three millions of &s;ouls in this political country, and who are all of them both able and willing to &s;teer the great ve&s;&s;el of the &s;tate, and to take upon them&s;elves the whole load of bu&s;ine&s;s and burthen of employments for the &s;ervice of their dear country.

<Q>I did not mean a&s;tronomical days, but political ones.</Q>
The young fellow replied, "O then, Sir, I am your &s;ervant," and went off in a laugh.</P>
<P>Thus informed and edified I went off too, but could not help reflecting on my way upon the &s;ingular ill luck of this my dear country, which, as long as ever I remember it, and as far back as I have read, has always been governed by the only two or three people, out of two or three mil|lions, totally incapable of governing, and unfit to be tru&s;ted. But the&s;e reflections were &s;oon interrupted by numbers of people, whom I ob|&s;erved crowding into a public hou&s;e. Among them I di&s;covered my worthy friend and tailor, that indu&s;trious mechanic, Mr. Regnier. I ap|plied to him to know the meaning of that con|cour&s;e: to which, with his u&s;ual humanity, he an&s;wered,
<Q>We are the ma&s;ter tailors, who are to meet to-night to con&s;ider what is to be done about our journeymen, who in&s;ult and impo&s;e upon us, to the great detriment of the trade.</Q>
I a&s;ked him whether, under his pro|tection, I might &s;lip in and hear their delibera|tions. He &s;aid, Yes, and welcome; for that they &s;hould do nothing to be a&s;hamed of. I pro|fited of this permi&s;&s;ion, and following him into the room, found a con&s;iderable number of the&s;e ingenious arti&s;ts a&s;&s;embled, and waiting only for the arrival of my friend, who it &s;eems was too con&s;iderable for bu&s;ine&s;s to begin without him. He accordingly took the lead, opened the meet|ing with a very hand&s;ome &s;peech, in which he gave many in&s;tances of the in&s;olence, the unrea|&s;onablene&s;s,
<PB N="91" REF="046224_0090_1020FDB105841430">
and the exorbitant demands of the journeymen tailors, and concluded with ob&s;er|ving&punc;
<Q>that if the government minded any thing now-a-days but them&s;elves, &s;uch abu&s;es would not have been &s;uffered; and had they been but attempted in Queen Elizabeth's days, &s;he would have worked them with a witne&s;s.</Q>
Another orator then ro&s;e up to &s;peak; but as I was &s;ure that he could &s;ay no|thing better than what had ju&s;t fallen from my worthy friend, I &s;tole off unob&s;erved and was pur&s;uing my way home, when, in the very next &s;treet, I di&s;covered a much greater number of people (though, by their dre&s;s, of &s;eemingly in|ferior note) ru&s;hing into another public hou&s;e. As numbers always excite my curio&s;ity almo&s;t as much as they mutually do each others pa&s;&s;ions, I crowded in with them, in order to di&s;cover the object of this meeting, not without &s;ome &s;u&s;pi|cion that this frequent &s;enate might be compo&s;ed of the journeymen tailors, and convened in op|po&s;ition to that which I had ju&s;t left. My &s;u&s;|picion was &s;oon confirmed by the eloquence of a journeyman, a fini&s;her, I pre&s;ume, who ex|patiated with equal warmth and dignity upon the inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion of the ma&s;ter tailors, to the utter ruin of thou&s;ands of poor journeymen and their families; and concluded with a&s;&s;ert|ing,
<Q>It was a &s;hame that the government and the parliament did not take notice of &s;uch abu&s;es; and that had the ma&s;ter tailors done the&s;e things in Queen Elizabeth's days, &s;he would have ma&s;tered them with a vengeance, &s;o &s;he would.</Q></P>

expre&s;&s;ions, of the ma&s;ter politicians, the ma&s;ter tailors, and the journeymen tailors. I am con|vinced that the two latter really and hone&s;tly be|lieved what they &s;aid, it not being in the lea&s;t improbable that their under&s;tandings &s;hould be the dupes of their intere&s;t: but I will not &s;o pe|remptorily an&s;wer for the interior conviction of the political orator; though, at the &s;ame time, I mu&s;t do him the ju&s;tice to &s;ay, he &s;eemed full dull enough to be very much in earne&s;t.</P>

From the&s;e &s;tudies I contracted an

early ta&s;te for gallantry; and as nothing plea&s;ed me &s;o much as the comedies of the la&s;t age, my thoughts were con&s;tantly engro&s;&s;ed with the en|viable &s;ituation of the heroes of tho&s;e pieces Your Dotimants and your Homers &s;truck my imagination beyond the brighte&s;t characters in Pope; and though I liked the gallantry of fighting ten years for a woman, yet I tho't the Greeks might have found a readier way of ma|king them&s;elves amends, by vi&s;iting their friends at Troy and taking revenge in kind. Such were the exploits to command my admira|tion, and &s;uch the examples which I looked up to&punc; and having manife&s;t advantages of per&s;on, I entertained mo&s;t extravagant conceits of my fu|ture triumphs. Yet even in the height of tho&s;e extravagancies I had no hope of obtaining every favour that I &s;olicited; much le&s;s &s;hould I have been per&s;uaded that &s;uch uncommon &s;ucce&s;s could be productive of any thing but con&s;ummate hap|pine&s;s. The hi&s;tory of my life will prove the contrary; and I chu&s;e to record it, with a view of &s;howing what a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of trouble, di&s;tre&s;s and mi&s;ery, aro&s;e from the very completion of my de&s;ires.</P>
<P>I was precipitately &s;ent to Oxford, on being di&s;covered in an intrigue with a young girl, whom my tutor had lately married, and who had a prior attachment to me. As my love for her was exce&s;&s;ive, this &s;eparation was inexpre&s;|&s;ibly painful; and I learned from it, that pa&s;t joys were no con&s;olation for pre&s;ent di&s;appoint|ment. I found the univer&s;ity life to little &s;uited to my ta&s;te, that I &s;oon prevailed upon my mo|ther to let me come to London. Before I had been a week in town I was introduced to a young
<PB N="94" REF="046224_0093_1020FDBA27D53460">
woman, whom I took &s;o great a fancy to, that the very violence of my pa&s;&s;ion made me de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s. I was, however, &s;o agreeably di&s;ap|pointed, that I could &s;carce conceal the tran&s;|ports of joy which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion gave me: but this joy was more than balanced, when at the end of &s;ome months I was told of the condition into which this kind creature was brought by her compliance with my de&s;ires. My anxiety upon this event was too great to be re&s;trained; and honour, which alone had &s;topt the overflowings of my joy, prompted me to give a loo&s;e to my concern. I bewailed with remor&s;e and tears the &s;hame and mi&s;ery of deluded innocence, and cur&s;ed my&s;elf as the author of &s;o much ruin and infamy. I &s;pared no expen&s;e to render her un|happy &s;ituation as comfortable as it could be made, and &s;hut my&s;elf up with her till the ex|pected time of her delivery. That fatal hour infinitely increa&s;ed our mutual &s;hame, by giving birth to a little negro, which though it deliver|ed me at once from the pangs of con&s;cience, put me to an immoderate expen&s;e in bribes to the nur&s;es to keep the &s;ecret of my di&s;grace.</P>
<P>This unlucky adventure had almo&s;t &s;poiled me for a man of gallantry; but I &s;oon lo&s;t all remembrance of ill u&s;age in the innocent &s;miles and gentle &s;weetne&s;s of a young lady, who gave me every mark of tender love and con&s;tancy. Our mutual fondne&s;s made it impo&s;&s;ible for us to bear that &s;eparation which di&s;cretion requir|ed: as &s;he gave up all her acquaintance for my &s;ake, &s;he &s;oon found her&s;elf abandoned by them; &s;o that our con&s;tant living together, which hi|therto had been choice, was now become an ab|&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity This confinement, though it did
<PB N="95" REF="046224_0094_1020FDBCB95F2240">
not abate, but, if po&s;&s;ible, increa&s;e my tender|ne&s;s, had &s;o different an effect upon her temper, as to cau&s;e a total change of behaviour to me and all about her: &s;he &s;tormed day and night, like a fury, and did every thing to drive me from her company; yet if ever I went from her upon the mo&s;t urgent bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;he would throw her|&s;elf into fits, and upbraid me with the mo&s;t bit|ter reproaches. On my being &s;ent for to attend my mother in her la&s;t moments, &s;he threatened, with horrid imprecations, that, if I left her then I &s;hould never &s;ee her more. I had &s;carce broke from her menaces when &s;he flew from her lodg|ings in an agony of pa&s;&s;ion, and has not been heard of &s;ince.</P>
<P>Soon after the death of my mother, a lady of quality who vi&s;ited her, and who had ca&s;t an en|vious eye upon her diamonds, which were not contemptible, took occa&s;ion to make &s;ome ad|vances towards me. Whenever we met, her di&s;cour&s;e always turned upon the great merits of my mother, and the ta&s;te which &s;he &s;howed in the choice and manner of wearing her jewels; and this conver&s;ation as con&s;tantly ended in an a&s;&s;ignation at her hou&s;e. Though I was at fir&s;t a little proud to find my pre&s;ents meet &s;o ready an acceptance, I was not exceedingly flattered in the progre&s;s of this amour; e&s;pecially when I began to perceive that the &s;tronge&s;t recommen|dation I had to her favour was growing weaker every day. I found al&s;o that a declaration which I had made of not loving cards did not contri|bute to &s;trengthen my intere&s;t in that family.</P>
<P>My next affair was with a lady who was really fond of me, and I thought my&s;elf, then, at the height of my wi&s;hes; for &s;he managed &s;o di&s;|creetly,
<PB N="96" REF="046224_0095_1020FDBFB7D073C0">
that we had not the lea&s;t interruption from her hu&s;band at home: but her conduct a|broad was a perpetual &s;cene of in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;cretion and tyranny. She obliged me to attend her every night to the opera, and never to &s;tir from her &s;ide. She would carry me to the mo&s;t frequented plays and keep me in a whi&s;per during the mo&s;t inter|e&s;ting &s;cenes. Not &s;atisfied with this, &s;he made me walk with her eternally in the Park, the Old Road, and Ken&s;ington gardens; and to com|plete her triumph, &s;he dragged me, a mi&s;erable object! about the &s;treets of London, with the &s;ame pityle&s;s o&s;tentation as the inhuman con|queror trailed the lifele&s;s carca&s;e of Hector round the walls of Troy. To complete my misfor|tunes, it happened that the <HI>beau monde</HI> e&s;tabli&s;h|ed a new mode of gallantry, and all knights amorous were required to make love after the new fa&s;hion, and attend their fair on hor&s;eback. Unluckily for me, my mother, not &s;u&s;pecting that hor&s;eman&s;hip would ever become, here, a requi&s;ite in gallantry, had made it no part of my Engli&s;h education: therefore, being an ab|&s;olute novice, I procured the quiete&s;t bea&s;t that was to be got, and hoped that I was properly mounted: but I &s;oon found my mi&s;take, for the dulne&s;s of the bea&s;t tended to bring a mo&s;t di&s;|graceful &s;u&s;picion on the &s;pirit of the rider; and I was obliged, at all events, to undertake a more mettle&s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eed.

While I was taken up with my own danger and di&s;grace, her hor&s;e, which had &s;tarted at the &s;ame time, ran a

different way, and as &s;he was no otherwi&s;e qua|lified for a rider but by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of be|ing a woman of fa&s;hion, &s;he was thrown again&s;t a tree, and killed on the &s;pot. The remem|brance of her fondne&s;s for me, though &s;o trou|ble&s;ome while living, was the cau&s;e of great af|fliction to me after her death; and it was near a twelvemonth before I &s;ettled my affections on a new object. This was a young widow, who though &s;he did not give me the &s;ame occa&s;ion of complaint as the la&s;t, created me no le&s;s pain by turning the tables upon me; in&s;tead of requir|ing my con&s;tant attendance, &s;he would complain that I haunted and dogged her; and would fre|quently &s;ecret her&s;elf, or run on purpo&s;e into &s;u&s;|picious company, purely to give me unea&s;ine&s;s. Though confe&s;&s;edly her favourite, I have fre|quently been denied admittance, when the mo&s;t worthle&s;s pretenders have been let in: and when I have offered her tickets for a concert which &s;he liked, &s;he has refu&s;ed them, and accepted of an invitation to a dull play, with the mo&s;t de&s;|picable of my rivals. When we have been at the &s;ame table at cards, &s;he has made it remark|ed by the whole a&s;&s;embly that her eyes and her di&s;cour&s;e have been indu&s;triou&s;ly kept from me; and &s;uch has been her cruelty, that when I have de&s;ired the honour of walking with her the next morning, &s;he has an&s;wered with a &s;ignificant &s;neer, &s;he was very &s;orry &s;he &s;hould not have my company, for &s;he intended to ride. With all this, who could imagine that I was the happy man! and yet, as I &s;pared no pains nor co&s;t in the enquiry, I can venture to pronounce that no other per&s;on whatever &s;hared her favours with me. Of all the tortures that can be devi&s;ed for

<P>Not to detain you with a farther detail of the plagues and di&s;quietudes, the di&s;coveries, expen|ces, fines, and dangers, which are incident to gallantry in general, I &s;hall only tell you that I at la&s;t perceived there was no peace nor comfor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for the votaries of Venus but under the au&s;pices of Hymen.

<HEAD>STORY of AGAMUS.</HEAD>
<P>TO indulge that re&s;tle&s;s impatience, which every man feels to relate incidents by which the pa&s;&s;ions have been greatly effected, and communicate ideas that have been forcibly impre&s;&s;ed, I have given you &s;ome account of my life, which, without farther apology or introduc|tion may, perhaps, be favourably received in your Book.</P>
<P>My mother died when I was very young; and my father, who was a naval commander, and had, therefore, no opportunity to &s;uperintend my conduct, placed me at a grammar &s;chool, and afterwards removed me to the univer&s;ity. At &s;chool the number of boys was &s;o great, that to regulate our morals was impo&s;&s;ible; and at the univer&s;ity even my learning contributed to the di&s;&s;olutene&s;s of my manners. As I was an only child, my father had always allowed me more money than I knew how to lay out, otherwi&s;e than in the gratification of my vices: I had &s;ometimes, indeed, been re&s;trained by a general &s;en&s;e of right and wrong; but I now oppo&s;ed the remon&s;trances of con&s;cience by the cavils of &s;ophi&s;try; and having learned of &s;ome celebra|ted philo&s;ophers as well ancient as modern, to prove that nothing is good but plea&s;ure, I be|came a rake upon principle.</P>
<P>My father died in the &s;ame year with Queen Anne, a few months before I became of age, and left me a very con&s;iderable fortune in the
<PB N="100" REF="046224_0099_1020FDCC39325580">
funds. I immediately quitted the univer&s;ity and came to London, which I con&s;idered as the great mart of plea&s;ure; and as I could afford to deal largely, I wi&s;ely determined not to endanger my capital. I projected a &s;cheme of life that was mo&s;t agreeable to my temper, which was rather &s;edate than volatile, and regulated my expences with the oeconomy of a philo&s;opher. I found that my favorite appetites might be gratified with greater convenience and le&s;s &s;candal&punc; in proportion as my life was more private: in&s;tead therefore, of incumbering my&s;elf with a family, I took the fir&s;t floor of a hou&s;e which was let into lod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ings, hired one &s;ervant, and kept a b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ace of geldings at a livery &s;table. I con&s;tantly fre|quented the theatres, and found my principles confirmed by almo&s;t every piece that was repre|&s;ented, particularly my re&s;olution never to mar|ry. In comedy, indeed, the action terminated in marriage&punc; but it was generally the marriage of a rake, who gave up his liberty with reluc|tance, as the only expedient to recover a fortune &mdash;and the hu&s;band and wife of the drama were wretches who&s;e example ju&s;tified this reluctance, and appeared to be exh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bited for no other pur|po&s;e than to warn mankind, that whatever may be pre&s;umed by tho&s;e whom indigence has made de&s;perate, to marry is to forfeit the quiet, inde|pendence and felicity of life.</P>
<P>In this cour&s;e I had continued twenty years, without having impaired my con&s;titution, le&s;&s;en|ed my fortune, or incumbered my&s;elf with an illegitimate offspring; when a girl about eigh|teen, was hired as a chambermaid by the per&s;on who kept the hou&s;e in which I lodged: the na|tive beauty of the health and &s;implicity in this young

creature, had &s;uch an effect upon my imagination that I practi&s;ed every art to debauch her, and at length &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>I found it convenient for her to continue in the hou&s;e, and therefore, made no propo&s;al of re|moving her into lodgings, but after a few months &s;he found her&s;elf with child, a di&s;covery which interrupted the indolence of my &s;en&s;uality, and made me repent my indi&s;cretion: however, as I would not incur my own cen&s;ure by ingrati|tude or inhumanity, I provided her a lodging and attendants, and &s;he was at length delivered of a daughter. The child I regarded as a new incumbrance; for though I did not con&s;ider my&s;elf as under parental or conjugal obligations, yet I could not think my&s;elf at liberty wholly to abandon the mother or the infant. To the mo|ther, indeed, I had &s;till &s;ome degree of inclina|tion; though I &s;hould have been heartily con|tent never to have &s;een her again, if I could at once have been freed from any farther trouble about her; but as &s;omething was to be done, I was willing to keep her within my reach, at lea&s;t till &s;he could be &s;ub&s;ervient to my plea&s;ure no longer: the child, however, I would have &s;ent away; but &s;he intreated me to let her &s;uc|kle it, with an importunity which I could not re&s;i&s;t. After much thinking, I placed her in a little &s;hop in the &s;uburbs, which I furni&s;hed, at the expence of about twenty pounds, with chan|dlery-ware, commodities of which &s;he had &s;ome knowledge, as her father was a petty &s;hop-keeper in the country: &s;he reported that her hu&s;band, had been killed in an engagement at &s;ea, and that his pay, which &s;he had been empowered to receive by his will, and purcha&s;ed her &s;tock. I now thought I had di&s;charged every obligation,
<PB N="102" REF="046224_0101_1020FDD102AA4BF8">
as I had enabled her to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, at lea&s;t as well as &s;he could have done by her labour in the &s;tation in which I found her; and as often as I had an inclination to &s;ee her, I &s;ent for her to a bagnio.</P>
<P>But the&s;e interviews did not produce the plea|&s;ure which I expected: her affection for me was too tender and delicate; &s;he often wept in &s;pite of all her efforts again&s;t it, and could not forbear telling me &s;tories of her little girl with the fond prolixity of a mother, when I wi&s;hed to regard her only as a mi&s;tre&s;s. The&s;e incidents at once touched me with a compunction, and quenched the appetite which I had intended to gratify; my vi&s;its, therefore became le&s;s frequent; but &s;he never &s;ent after me when I was ab&s;ent, nor reproached me, otherwi&s;e than by tears of ten|derne&s;s when &s;he &s;aw me again.</P>
<P>After the fir&s;t year I wholly neglected her; and having heard nothing of her during the winter, I went to &s;pend the &s;ummer in the country. When I returned, I was prompted rather by curio&s;ity than de&s;ire to make &s;ome in|quiry after her; and &s;oon learnt that &s;he had died &s;ome months before of the &s;mall-pox, that the goods had been &s;eized for rent, and the child taken by the pari&s;h. At this account, &s;o &s;udden and unexpected, I was &s;en&s;ibly touched; and at fir&s;t conceived a de&s;ign to re&s;cue the child from the hands of a pari&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur&s;e, and make &s;ome little provi&s;ion for it when it &s;hould be grown up: but this was delayed from day to day; &s;uch was the &s;upinene&s;s of my di&s;po&s;ition, till the event was remembered with le&s;s and le&s;s &s;en&s;i|bility; and at length I congratulated my&s;elf upon my deliverance from an engagement which I had always con&s;idered as re&s;embling in &s;ome degree the &s;hackles of matrimony. I re&s;olved
<PB N="103" REF="046224_0102_1020FDD3E01EAFD0">
to incur the &s;ame embarra&s;&s;ment no more, and contented my&s;elf with &s;trolling from one pro&s;ti|tute to another, of whom I have &s;een many ge|nerations peri&s;h; and the new faces which I once &s;ought among the ma&s;ks in the pit, I found with le&s;s trouble at Cuper's, Vauxhall, Ranelagh, and innumerable other places of public enter|tainment, which have appeared during the la&s;t twenty years of my life.</P>
<P>A few weeks ago I celebrated my &s;ixtieth birth-day with &s;ome friends at a tavern; and as I was returning to my lodgings, I &s;aw a hackney coach &s;top at the door of a hou&s;e which I knew to be of ill repute, though it was private and of the cla&s;s. Ju&s;t as I came up a girl &s;tepped out of it, who appeared, by the imperfect glimp&s;e I caught of her as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed, to be very young, and extremely beautiful. As I was warm with wine, I followed her in without he&s;itation, and was delighted to find her equally charming upon a nearer view. I detained the coach, and pro|po&s;ed that we &s;hould go to Haddock's: &s;he he&s;i|tated with &s;ome appearance of unwillingne&s;s and confu&s;ion&punc; but at length con&s;ented: &s;he &s;oon be|came more free, and I was not le&s;s plea&s;ed with her conver&s;ation than her per&s;on I ob&s;er|ved that &s;he had a &s;oftne&s;s and mode&s;ty, in her manners, which is quickly worn off by habitu|al pro&s;titution.</P>
<P>We had drank a bottle of French wine, and were preparing to go to bed, when, to my un|&s;peakable confu&s;ion and a&s;toni&s;hment, I di&s;cov|ered a mark by which I knew her to be my child: for I remembered that the poor girl, whom I &s;o cruelly &s;educed and neglected, had once told me with tears in her eyes, that &s;he had imprinted the two letters of my name under her little NAN|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'s

The poor wretch, whom I was about to hire for the gratification of a brutal ap|petite, perceived my di&s;order with &s;urprize and concern; &s;he enquired with an officious &s;ollici|tude, what &s;udden illne&s;s had &s;eized me; &s;he took my hand, pre&s;&s;ed it, and looked eagerly in my face, &s;till inqui&s;itive what could be done to relieve me. I remained &s;ome time torpid: but was &s;oon rouzed by the reflection, that I was re|ceiving the care&s;&s;es of my child, whom I had abandoned to the lowe&s;t infamy, to be the &s;lave of drunkene&s;s and lu&s;t, and whom I had led to the brink of ince&s;t, I &s;uddenly &s;tarted up; fir&s;t held her at a di&s;tance; then catching her in my arms, &s;trove to &s;peak, but bur&s;t into tears. I &s;aw that &s;he was confounded and terrified; and as &s;oon as I could recover my &s;peech, I put an end to her doubts by revealing the &s;ecret.</P>

<P>We &s;at up together the remainder of the night, which I &s;pent in li&s;tening to a &s;tory that I may, perhaps, hereafter communicate; and the next day I took lodgings for her about &s;ix miles from town. I vi&s;it her every day with emotions to which my heart has till now been a

I propo&s;e to retire with her into &s;ome remote part of the country, and to atone for the pa&s;t by the future: but alas! of the future a few years only can remain; and of the pa&s;t not a moment can return. What atone|ment can I make to tho&s;e upon who&s;e daughters I have contributed to perpetrate that calamity, from which by miracle I have re&s;cued my own; How can I bear the reflection, that though for my own child I had hitherto expre&s;&s;ed le&s;s kind|ne&s;s than brutes for their young; yet perhaps, every other whom I either hired or &s;educed to pro&s;titution, had been gazed at in the ardor of parental affection, till tears have &s;tarted to the eye: had been catched to the bo&s;om with tran&s;|port, in the prattling &s;implicity of infancy; had been watched in &s;ickne&s;s with anxiety that &s;u&s;|pended &s;leep; had been fed by the toil of in|du&s;trious poverty, and reared to maturity with hope and fear. What a mon&s;ter is he, by whom the&s;e fears are verified, and this hope deceived! And yet, &s;o dreadful is the force of habitual guilt, I &s;ometimes regret the re&s;traint which is come upon me; I wi&s;h to &s;ink again into the &s;lumber from which I have been rouzed, and to repeat the crimes which I abhor. My heart is this moment bur&s;ting for utterance: but I want words. Farewell.</P>
