<HEAD>AN ORATION, &amp;c. FEBRUARY 22, 1800.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY FELLOW CITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE are now a&s;&s;embled to review the life and to lament the Death, of the fir&s;t of unin&s;pired Men. We have often met to celebrate our national Independence. We never be|fore a&s;&s;embled to weep over the memory of the man, who un|der the au&s;pices of heaven e&s;tabli&s;hed us an Independent Na|tion. The grateful tribute, which America this day pays her Wa&s;hington will not be forgotten. It will be regi&s;tered in the annals of our country for the in&s;truction of mankind, and remote&s;t po&s;terity will read with mournful plea&s;ure and admiration our expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude and grief. As the death of this great man is a national calamity, there is a pro|priety in our national conduct. And &s;ince this day, &s;ixty eight years, introduced him into life, this day is fitly cho&s;en, for the people to a&s;&s;emble in their re&s;pective cities and villa|ges, as a nation to recollect his virtues and bewail his death.</P>
<P>WHEN great and good men fall, in proportion to their greatne&s;s and goodne&s;s is the public lo&s;s, and in the &s;ame proportion &s;hould be the public grief. If the character of Wa&s;hington may be e&s;timated by the effu&s;ions of grief, which in the moment of general feeling have been poured forth to his memory, he was great and good. His memory &s;hall live. It &s;hall live, to &s;timulate others to live like him, and as a tri|bute due to departed merit.</P>
<P>WHEN Mo&s;es died, the Children of I&s;rael wept for him in the plains of moab thirty days. With equal ju&s;tice may the inhabitants of this land weep for their beloved Wa&s;hington. By his death every de&s;cription of citizens is called to mourn|ing, and &s;uch as are &s;killful in lamentation to wailing. And while freedom waves her banner over this happy land, all the &s;inging men and &s;inging women will &s;peak of him in their lamentations.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="037493_0003_100D4636AE685B18">IF we &s;earch the pages of ancient or modern times, in what age or country &s;hall we find a character &s;o univer&s;ally belov|ed and re&s;pected? Such is the reputation, which he acquir|ed and pre&s;erved thro' life, that the man, who attempts to wound his fame, brings di&s;honor upon him&s;elf. His eminent talents were con&s;ecrated to the &s;ervice of his country. His exalted virtues gave him the fir&s;t &s;eat in the hearts of his Fellow Citizens. He lived and died the ornament of human nature, his country's pride and boa&s;t.</P>
<P>Illu&s;trious men have frequently ri&s;en up, who have been eminently u&s;eful in their day. But they have generally ex|hibited to the world a ver&s;atility of character. Not &s;o the illu&s;trious Wa&s;hington. However diver&s;ified his lot, he ex|hibited him&s;elf the &s;ame. In pro&s;perity and adver&s;ity he has been uniformly great and good.&mdash;Men of talents, devoid of principle, in&s;tead of being ble&s;&s;ings to the world, generally prove &s;courges to mankind. The man, who&s;e memory we now honor, was endowed with uncommon talents, and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of virtuous principles. The&s;e united have rendered him a rich ble&s;&s;ing to his country; and while talents and vir|tue are re&s;pected, he will command the e&s;teem, &amp; &s;tand forth the admiration of the world.</P>
<P>IN all the relations and characters, which he &s;u&s;tained, he merits attention. Whether we view him in <HI>public</HI> or in <HI>pri|vate</HI> life, as a WARRIOR, a STATESMAN, or a CITIZEN, we love &amp; admire the man. The tran&s;actions of this day, my friends, will rather dimini&s;h, than add to his Glory. For as the fine&s;t pencil cannot paint like nature, &s;o no portrait will be drawn of his character, which will ju&s;tly repre&s;ent him. Too low or too high coloring will mar every picture. The mo&s;t &s;trik|ing re&s;emblance will be the mo&s;t beautiful.</P>
<P>BUT however deficient we may be in taking the portrait of our Wa&s;hington, we &s;hall expre&s;s our gratitude for his &s;er|vices, and our admiration of his character. We &s;hall ex|hibit a Phaenomenon, new in the hi&s;tory of nations; a repub|lic, which knows how to appreciate and reward the &s;ervices of her citizens.</P>
<P>THE highe&s;t happine&s;s of Rome con&s;i&s;ted in &s;ending into exile the men, who had rendered her the mo&s;t &s;ignal &s;ervices. Ingratitude has hitherto been characteri&s;tic of republics. We &s;hall re&s;cue them from this reproach. It is left to the eighteenth

century, and to this we&s;tern world, properly to re&s;pect merit. America has never lo&s;t &s;ight of the virtues, nor forgotten the good deeds of her Wa&s;hington. And &s;he will this day re|view his life with as much plea&s;ure, as the traveller repeats the &s;tory of his travels, the &s;eaman his adventures, and the warrior the battles he has won.</P>
<P>GEORGE WASHINGTON was the 3'd &s;on of Mr. AUGUSTINE WASHINGTON, a wealthy farmer of di&s;tingui&s;hed reputation in Virginia. His ance&s;tors came from England about the year 1657. He was the fir&s;t fruit of a &s;econd marriage, and at the commencement of our Revolution had living three Brothers, and one &s;i&s;ter. Under a private tutor he was taught the ru|diments of the Latin language, Engli&s;h Grammar, &amp; the ele|ments of the Mathematics. At the age of ten years he bu|ried his Father. The morning of his days however did not pa&s;s inactive, nor was it &s;pent in vanity and vice. While a pure mountain air and the healthy occupations of rural life favoured the production of a large and well proportioned bo|dy, his application to u&s;eful &s;tudies tended to the formation of a correct and &s;olid mind. Having laid the foundation of his eminence in its proper &s;ea&s;on, he entered the theatre of life, peculiarly well calculated to act the noble part, which we have &s;een him exhibit. No man ever walked the &s;tage to better advantage, or left it with greater applau&s;e.</P>
<P>WITH what &s;atisfaction may we take a view of him in the character of a CITIZEN? Virtuous &s;implicity adorned his pri|vate life. In his family &s;eat at Mount Vernon, we behold him exhibiting to his fellow citizens an example worthy of Imitation. He was the greate&s;t farmer of which his Country did boa&s;t. In 1776 his landed property was e&s;timated at "more than a hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling." He rai&s;ed in one year <Q>&s;even thou&s;and bu&s;hels of wheat, &amp; ten thou&s;and of Indian Corn.</Q> The year following he rai&s;ed <Q>two hundred lambs, &s;owed twenty &s;even bu&s;hels of flax &s;eed, &amp; planted more than &s;even hundred bu&s;hels of potatoes. He had manufactured under his own eye, by his dome&s;tics, linen and woollen cloth &s;ufficient for his hou&s;ehold, which confu&s;|ed of nearly a thou&s;and &s;ouls.</Q> The &s;tricte&s;t oeconomy and mo&s;t exemplary method were e&s;tabli&s;hed in all his depart|ments. Reports were weekly received by him from his over&s;eers, and correctly regi&s;tered in his agricultural books: and at the end of every year, he was able accurately to de|termine the labor and produce of his farm. Hu&s;bandry was
<PB N="6" REF="037493_0005_100D463A983CC1F8">
his delight, and as he cultivated his farm with plea&s;ure, &s;o with equal plea&s;ure he <HI>contributed more</HI> than any <HI>Farmer</HI> in America to the &s;upport of that Government, which confirmed him in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and &s;ecured to him the profits of his farm. The ble&s;&s;ings of good Government he knew how to appreciate, and while he gloried in American Freedom, he yielded, as a &s;ubject, implicit obedience to his country's laws.</P>
<P>IN dome&s;tic and &s;ocial life, he was a kind hu&s;band, a gentle ma&s;ter, an unfailing friend, and a bountiful benefactor. <HI>When the ear heard</HI> him <HI>it ble&s;&s;ed</HI> him, <HI>and when the eye &s;aw</HI> him, <HI>it gave witne&s;s to</HI> him; for he <HI>delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherle&s;s, and him that had none to help him.</HI> In his intercour&s;e with his fellow men, the &s;tricte&s;t honor &amp; integrity were &s;tamped upon his conduct, and punctuality marked all his engagements. Kind and generous in his di&s;|po&s;ition, <HI>the ble&s;&s;ings</HI> of many <HI>ready to peri&s;h came upon</HI> him, and he <HI>cau&s;ed the widows heart to &s;ing for joy.</HI></P>
<P>REGULARITY, temperance &amp; indu&s;try were habits in which he lived. He generally ro&s;e at the dawn of day and his u&s;ual hour for retirement was nine in the evening. Every hour had a&s;&s;igned to it its proper employment: &amp; to his own &amp; his country's honor be it &s;poken, in the&s;e a&s;&s;ignments religion had its place. Amid&s;t the multiplicity of his concerns he remem|bered God. This is the brighte&s;t part of this great man's Character. Feeling his entire dependence, he daily, at &s;tat|ed &s;ea&s;ons, paid his acknowledgements to his maker and &s;ought his ble&s;&s;ing. With what plea&s;ure do we behold him expre&s;&s;ing the morality of the go&s;pel in his life, and a&s;cribing, in his public, writings, <Q>the meliorated condition of man|kind, and the encrea&s;ed ble&s;&s;ings of &s;ociety, <HI>to the</HI> PURE <HI>and benign light of</HI> REVELATION?</Q> With what plea&s;ure do we behold him, offering up earne&s;t prayer to God, that he would di&s;po&s;e us all, to exhibit in our lives tho&s;e virtues, <Q>which were the characteri&s;tics of the DIVINE AUTHOR <HI>of our</HI> BLESSED RELIGION; <HI>without an humble imitation of who&s;e example,</HI></Q> in this re&s;pect, <Q><HI>we can never hope to be a hap|py nation?</HI></Q> He was punctual and devout in his attendance upon the in&s;tituted wor&s;hip of Chri&s;t. He honored Gods Sab|baths: &amp; may we not charitably hope, that God gave him in his hou&s;e and within his walls, <HI>a place and a name, better than of &s;ons and of daughters?</HI></P>
<P>LET us now turn and view him in PUBLIC LIFE. Here he

<P>His talents as a CIVILIAN did not pa&s;s unnoticed by his na|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ve &s;tate. From the year 1759, when he re&s;igned his com|mi&s;&s;ion, as Commander in chief of all the Virginia forces, which had been rai&s;ed, to repel the French, who were endea|vouring to &s;ubjugate the&s;e colonies, and annex them to the Crown of France, he was con&s;tantly a member of a&s;&s;embly, till the year '74; when he was called to take a more con&s;pic|uous part in the politicks of his country. He was <Q>a magi&s;|trate of the county in which he lived, and a judge of the court;</Q> and in this capacity di&s;charged his duty with &s;in|gular applau&s;e. Clothed with righteou&s;ne&s;s, he was <HI>eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame, and the cau&s;e,</HI> which he <HI>knew not,</HI> he <HI>&s;earched out.</HI> When the rapacious hand of Britain was gra&s;ping at the liberties of America, he was honored by his fellow citizens with a &s;eat in the fir&s;t and &s;econd Congre&s;s, which a&s;&s;embled to con&s;ult the intere&s;ts of the nation.</P>
<P>SINCE the e&s;tabli&s;hment of our Independence, we have &s;een him acting a very intere&s;ting and dignified part. We have &s;een him in our public councils like the &s;tately cedar in the fore&s;t. He was Pre&s;ident of that Convention, which in the &s;ummer of '87, in Philadelphia, framed that excellent Con|&s;titution of Government, which is the Bulwark of American liberty. When, according to the Con&s;titution, a man was &s;ought for, to &s;it at helm and execute the laws, by the united voice of his country he was called to this important &s;tation. On the 30th of April '89, in the City of New-York, amid&s;t the acclamations of thou&s;ands, he was inaugurated Pre&s;ident of the United States.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">At this time he was clothed in a &s;uit of American Man|ufacture.</NOTE> Twice was he thus publickly inve&s;ted with the highe&s;t Office, which a grateful people could be&s;tow. With what honor to him&s;elf and advantage to his country he di&s;charged the duties of this elevated action, let the ble&s;&s;ing of millions te&s;tify, which followed him from the chair of &s;tate to the peaceful retreats of private life. Thro' two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive periods of the pre&s;idency, while great convul&s;ions were agi|tating the nations with whom we &s;tood connected, with what wi&s;dom did he &s;teer our national bark upon the <Q>tempe&s;tuous &s;ea of Liberty?</Q> Haughty Briton preyed upon our Com|merce.

Unawed by fear, uninflu|enced by party, like a rock in the mid&s;t of the &s;ea again&s;t which the waves da&s;h in vain, he re&s;olved that we &s;hould be re&s;pect|ed as an Independent nation, and that no act of his &s;hould in|volve us in tho&s;e calamities under which Europe groaned. Succe&s;sful in his mea&s;ures, and grown old in his country's &s;ervice, with a glory equal to his years, he nobly retired from the <Q>boundle&s;s field of public action, ince&s;&s;ant trouble and high re&s;pon&s;ibility,</Q> and cheerfully a&s;&s;umed the Citizen.</P>
<P>LET us now turn and contemplate this great man in the character of a WARRIOR. In the morning of life he exhibited proofs of his military Genius. "At the age of 15 he was entered a mid&s;hipman on board a Briti&s;h &s;hip of war, and had his baggage prepared for embarkation": but in compli|ance with his mother's wi&s;hes, who expre&s;&s;ed a "reluctance at his engaging in that profe&s;&s;ion," he relinqui&s;hed the plan. Before he reached the age of 21 he was honored with the rank of major in the military department. In 53 we find him engaged in an important and perilous emba&s;&s;y to the French and Indians, who were making encroachments upon our we&s;tern frontiers. Behold the illu&s;trious Wa&s;hington, at the age of 21, pre&s;&s;ing through the wilderne&s;s on foot, with his provi&s;ions on his back, to remon&s;trate with the French commander, and treat with the ho&s;tile Tribes. Be|hold him with patriotic ardor entering upon this important &s;ervice, in an uncommonly &s;evere &s;ea&s;on, accompanied with few attendants! Ram&s;ay, the Hi&s;torian, &s;ays, but one.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="037493_0008_100D464156946928">THE next year, we find him with a Colonel's Commi&s;&s;ion at the head of 300 men, going forth with dauntle&s;s courage to oppo&s;e the&s;e invaders of his country. Learning from a pri&s;oner, that the enemy were 1500 &s;trong, he encamped with his little army, now encrea&s;ed to about 400 effective men, at a place called the <HI>Great Meadows.</HI> Here he threw up &s;ome temporary works, which from his peculiar &s;ituation he named <HI>Fort Nece&s;&s;ity.</HI> While he here waited, expecting reinforcements, he was attacked by nearly four times his number of French and Indians. In this de&s;perate &s;ituation, after a brave re&s;i&s;tance, worthy of him&s;elf, he nobly capitula|ted, and marched out at the head of his troops with the honors of war.</P>
<P>THE year following, GENERAL BRADDOCK came over with two veteran Regiments to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the colonies. But &s;uch was the arrangement of rank that "no officer who did not <HI>immediately</HI> derive his commi&s;&s;ion from the KING, could command one who did." Colonel WASHINGTON there|fore re&s;igned his commi&s;&s;ion, and as a volunteer and extra aid de camp, joined the General. In marching for fort <HI>du que&s;ne,</HI> they were unexpectedly met by the enemy. A hard fought and bloody battle en&s;ued, which terminated in the total defeat of Braddock's army. Colonel WASHINGTON nobly di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf on this trying occa&s;ion. By <HI>his</HI> valor many were re&s;cued from &s;laughter on that calamitous day. <Q>He was the only officer, who&s;e duty obliged him to be on hor&s;eback during the battle who was not either killed or wounded. Providence &s;eemed to re&s;erve him to &s;ave from utter de&s;truction the wreck of a defeated army.</Q> With his brave provincials he covered the confu&s;ed retreat, and ha&s;ten|ed to concert mea&s;ures for their future &s;afety. Notwith&s;tand|ing the fatigues of the preceeding day, we behold him with two guides travelling the dreary wilderne&s;s, in the dark&s;ome night, and &s;o exau&s;ted in the morning, as to be under the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of being &s;upported with cu&s;hions on his hor&s;e! Noble youth! how did the love of country inflame thy brea&s;t? Pre&s;ident Davies, in a &s;ermon preached to a military compa|ny in the year '55, points him out to the public, as one, whom Providence had hitherto pre&s;erved, in the mo&s;t &s;ignal manner, for &s;ome important &s;ervice to his country.</P>
<P>The government of Virginia, &s;en&s;ible of his merits, in a new commi&s;&s;ion, placed him at the head of all the troops
<PB N="10" REF="037493_0009_100D464306BDA988">
rai&s;ed, and to be rai&s;ed in that colony. This commi&s;&s;ion he held with &s;ingular credit, till the French and Indians were entirely vanqui&s;hed, and tranquility was re&s;tored.</P>
<P>IN '59 he exchanged the &s;oldier for the citizen, married the widow Martha Curtis, and &s;ettled as a farmer at Mount Vernon. Here he cultivated the arts of peace, till the year '75, when by the unanimous vote of Congre&s;s, of whom he was him&s;elf a member, he was placed at the head of the ar|mies of the United States.</P>
<P>WE come now to an intere&s;ting period in the life of this great man. His actions from that day forward are familiar to our minds. We no longer contemplate him, as directing the forces of an individual &s;tate; but as heading the armies of 13 &s;tates in union; and founding an empire, which will ri&s;e and ri&s;e, till it &s;hall far exceed the mo&s;t celebrated empires of ancient date.</P>
<P>LET us ca&s;t our&s;elves back to the commencement of the <HI>American Revolution.</HI> With what feelings will a recollecti|on of the hopes and fears of that anxious day in&s;pire our minds? Happy in the inheritance left us by our fathers, we hoped &s;till to enjoy it; and to tran&s;mit it unimpaired to po&s;|terity. The projects of Great Britain alarmed our fears. We &s;aw this haughty nation, whom we had been taught to look up to, as to a parent, envying us the happine&s;s of free born &s;ons, and gra&s;ping at our liberties. On the one hand, to depre&s;s our &s;pirits, the power of Britain was great. On the other, to excite our hopes and &s;timulate our exertions, the prize for which we were to contend was greater.</P>
<P>WE were &s;en&s;ible, that we were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a goodly land, where we might eat in &s;afety the increa&s;e of the field, and &s;uck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock. We con&s;idered, that it was the gift of Heaven to our fathers, who fled from per&s;ecution in their native land. We called to mind the dangers, which they braved: how they gat their bread by the peril of their lives becau&s;e of the &s;word of the wilderne&s;s. We remembered how God was with them: how he protected them as the apple of his eye, and bore them as on eagles wings. We encouraged our&s;elves, that the God of our fathers would be our God; and relying upon his aid, we re&s;olved to <HI>live</HI> and <HI>die</HI> like <HI>Freemen,</HI> in the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on of our rights.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="037493_0010_100D4644ADA1D2E0">STILL, <HI>fears</HI> were in the way. From one end of the con|tinent to the other, the cry was made: There is no <HI>king</HI> in us and our <HI>coun&s;ellor</HI> is peri&s;hed.

To the a&s;toni&s;hment of the world, the earth brought forth at once, &amp; a <HI>nation was born in a day!</HI></P>
<P>TIME will not permit us to recapitulate the various incidents of the revolution in which the illu&s;trious WASHINGTON ap|peared &s;o glorious. Clouds and darkne&s;s many times re&s;ted upon our pro&s;pects; but in the mo&s;t gloomy &s;ea&s;on, this great man retained the affection and confidence of his fellow &s;oldiers and fellow citizens. In the darke&s;t hour, when hearts of oak were ready to yield, he remained firm and undaunted, &amp; never lo&s;t &s;ight of the pillar of cloud, and the pillar of fire.</P>
<P>BEHOLD him in the Jer&s;eys, with his little army, hunted up and down like a Patridge upon the mountains. Who but WASHINGTON could have in&s;pired his feeble band with courage, fleeing before a victorious enemy, and in&s;cribing upon the <HI>frozen</HI> ground, with their <HI>naked</HI> feet, their attachment to their General, in <HI>letters of blood?</HI></P>
<P>BUT perhaps in no in&s;tance during the revolutionary war, does this great man appear &s;o great, as in the clo&s;ing &s;cene. A victorious army was about to be di&s;banded. The exhau&s;ted re&s;ources of the country rendered it impo&s;&s;ible to give them pre&s;ent compen&s;ation for their &s;ervices. By the artful in&s;inua|tions of an anonymous writer the minds of Officers and Sol|diers were inflamed, and they were ju&s;t ready to turn their &s;words upon that very country, which they had &s;o gloriou&s;ly defended. The illu&s;trious WASHINGTON &s;tepped forth. He conjured them by the rights of humanity, by the honor of &s;oldiers, by the patrioti&s;m of citizens, not to <Q>open the flood gates of civil di&s;cord, and deluge their ri&s;ing empire with blood.</Q></P>
<P>HIS unbounded influence, over an army, which had parti|cipated in his toils and dangers, and been witne&s;&s;es of his wi&s;dom and valor, rendered him victorious. The tumult

&s;ub&s;ided. They unanimou&s;ly re&s;olved, that <Q>no circum&s;tances of di&s;tre&s;s or danger, &s;hould induce a conduct, that might tend to fully the reputation and glory they had acquired.</Q></P>
<P>WITH what &s;plendor does the, the noble WASHINGTON appear in this tran&s;action? Why did he not, by a &s;ingle word, blow up into a <HI>blaze</HI> the &s;editious &s;park, and like Octavianus in|&s;pire his &s;oldiers to demand the <HI>con&s;ulate</HI> for their General? Why did he not, like the conqueror of Italy and Egypt, with the unmeaning expre&s;&s;ions of Liberty and Equality in his mouth, <HI>&s;eize upon the admini&s;tration of his country;</HI> and be|cau&s;e he could &s;wear by no greater, <HI>&s;wear</HI> in <HI>his own name</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">onaparte's &s;peech, at the Bar of the Elders, Nov. 9th 1799, when he had <HI>forcibl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> over turned the Con&s;titution of his Country.</NOTE> and in the name of his comrades in arms, that he would main|tain a republic, upon the ba&s;is of rational liberty &amp; equal rights? Deeds, like the&s;e, how hateful to the pure and elevated mind of WASHINGTON! With a dignity peculiar to him&s;elf, he &s;ur|rendered into the hands of Congre&s;s, the appointment, which he "accepted with diffidence"; and with heartfelt &s;atisfaction, the ble&s;&s;ing of millions attending him, retired from the &s;er|vice of his country, hoping never to embark again on the "tempe&s;tuous and uncertain ocean of public life."</P>
<P>THE wi&s;hes of his fellow citizens corre&s;ponded with his own, that he might never again be called to a&s;&s;ume the cha|racter of a &s;oldier. But how vain are mortal wi&s;hes? His country once more demands his aid, as commander of her forces. He obeys the &s;ummons.</P>
<P>HIS obedience could not re&s;ult from motives of <HI>private intere&s;t</HI>: for with a noble genero&s;ity, &s;uch as he had been accu&s;tomed <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">When appointed to command the American forces in 1775; and when he accepted the Pre&s;idency of the United States, he expre&s;&s;ly declared receiving any pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uniary compen&s;ation for his &s;ervices.</NOTE> to exerci&s;e, he expre&s;sly declined receiving any emolument annexed to the appointment. It could not re&s;ult from a de&s;ire of <HI>aggrandizing him&s;elf</HI> and <HI>family,</HI> by the de|&s;truction of our <HI>republic,</HI> and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a <HI>monarchy</HI> upon its ruins: for he knew that his lamp was nearly <HI>ex|pended,</HI> that a crown would <HI>tarni&s;h</HI> his glory, and that he had neither <HI>child</HI> nor <HI>brother.</HI> It mu&s;t therefore have re|&s;ulted from that patrioti&s;m, which ever fired his brea&s;t, and from a conviction of the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of the <HI>mea&s;ures</HI> adopted
<PB N="13" REF="037493_0012_100D4648C0DF1560">
by <HI>admini&s;tration.</HI> This conviction is completely &s;tamped upon his letter of acceptance. Writing to the Pre&s;ident he &s;ays: <Q>Satisfied, that you have <HI>&s;incerely</HI> wi&s;hed and endea|vored to avert war, and exhau&s;ted to the <HI>la&s;t drop</HI> the cup of reconciliation, we can with pure hearts appeal to Hea|ven for the ju&s;tice of our cau&s;e; and may confidently tru&s;t the final re&s;ult to that kind Providence, who has heretofore, and &s;o often, &s;ignally favored the people of the&s;e U.

Thinking in this manner, and feeling how incumbent it is upon <HI>every per&s;on</HI> to <HI>contribute</HI> at all times to his coun|try's welfare, and <HI>e&s;pecially</HI> in a <HI>moment like the pre&s;ent, when every thing we hold dear and &s;acred</HI> is &s;o <HI>&s;eriou&s;ly threatened,</HI> I have finally determined to accept the com|mi&s;&s;ion of Commander in chief of the Armies of the Uni|ted States. I take the liberty to mention, that I mu&s;t de|cline having my acceptance con&s;idered, as drawing after it any immediate charge upon the public; or that I can re|ceive any emoluments annexed to the appointment, before entering into a &s;ituation to incur expen&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>WITH what a glowing pencil does our beloved WASHING|TON here paint the &s;entiments and feelings of his heart? And how many patriotic brea&s;ts has this painting in&s;pired with &s;imilar &s;entiments and feelings?</P>
<P>What pity is it, that &s;uch friends to the world, &s;uch pro|tectors of the rights of men, &s;hould ever die? But what man is he that liveth &amp; &s;hall not &s;ee death? This great man has fal|len! His lu&s;tre as a CITIZEN, his eminence as a STATESMAN, his celebrity as a WARRIOR, were props too feeble to &s;upport him. His coat of mail, which had &s;hielded him, for &s;uch a length of time, from the greate&s;t dangers, was no &s;ecurity. He fell in all his military trappings, and with all his martial honors upon him. While Capt. of the American ho&s;t, and in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him&s;elf, at the fir&s;t &s;ummons, he re&s;igned his commi&s;&s;ion into the hands of death. How great is that power, to which &s;o great a General, &s;o readily &s;ubmits!</P>
<P>WE &s;hall retire to our dwellings impre&s;&s;ed with the vanity of all earthly greatne&s;s. God has taken from us the judge and the prudent, the ancient and the honorable, the mighty Man, and the Man of War. How humbling to our pride is the con&s;ideration, that no circum&s;tances or degree of greatne&s;s, are of any avail when the King of Terrors advances? The greate&s;t general mu&s;t die like men, and fall like one of the Pea&s;ants.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="037493_0013_100D464AD6643938">WE &s;hall retire to our dwellings, filled with Grief, that &s;o much greatne&s;s and goodne&s;s mu&s;t &s;ubmit to death.

<P>WE &s;hall retire to our dwellings, in&s;pired with &s;entiments of gratitude to God, for rai&s;ing up and continuing to us &s;o long, a man &s;o exten&s;ively great and good. God is never in want of in&s;truments to accompli&s;h the important purpo&s;es of his providence. When the time drew near, in which this land was to be planted with civilized men, he rai&s;ed up Colum|bus, and endowed him with a &s;pirit of enterprize, adequate to the important di&s;coveries, which he made. When the days were accompli&s;hed, and we mu&s;t emerge from under tutors &amp; governors, and a&s;&s;ume a &s;tation among the nations of the earth, he rai&s;ed up and &s;ent us Wa&s;hington, furni&s;hed in a peculiar manner for the part a&s;&s;igned him in this grand event. He, who rai&s;ed him up, has cho&s;en the be&s;t time for his removal. America has never &s;een the day, when &s;he could have &s;pared him &s;o well. Age might have dimini&s;hed, but nothing could have encrea&s;ed the glory of his Character. He had complet|ed his work, and it was ju&s;t, that he &s;hould receive his wages. He has gloriou&s;ly retired in his full &s;trength; and neither time nor mortals have it in their power to ob&s;cure his bright|ne&s;s. The unerring judge of men will weigh all his great actions in an even ballance, and di&s;tingui&s;h him with &s;uitable rewards.</P>
<P>THERE is a wonderful coincidence of character, between the LEADERS of God's ancient &amp; his American I&s;rael. They were both peculiarly watched over and in&s;tructed in the days of youth. They were both Pre&s;idents in council and Gene|rals in the Field. They both delivered their Brethren from bondage, and e&s;tabli&s;hed them in Freedom and Independence. They both brought their re&s;pective nations in &s;ight of a per|manent &s;eat for their public councils. A few &s;teps more, &amp; the i&s;raeliti&s;h nation would have pitched their Government in Canaan. A few &s;teps more, and the American nation would have pitched their Government in the City of Wa&s;hington. MOSES longed for the completion of his peoples travels, and to go with them, and &s;ee them in full, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the good land, which was beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain and

WASHINGTON longed for the completion of his peo|ple's foreign and dome&s;tic trials, and to go with them, and &s;ee their Government permanently &s;eated in that goodly city, which is called by his own name. Both were denied the &s;ight. And to complete the picture, both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a few hours warning, when their eyes were not dim, nor their natural force abated.</P>
<P>THE Jews wept for Mo&s;es: and we this day weep for Wa&s;hington. Go with me to Mount Vernon, and behold him great even in death. With what noblene&s;s of mind does he receive the &s;ummons to &s;ubmit to the King of terrors, &amp; re&s;ign his body a pri&s;oner to the grave? Behold this un|equalled man, clo&s;ing his mouth and eyes, with his <HI>own hands,</HI> and expiring without a <HI>&s;igh,</HI> or a <HI>groan</HI>!!!</P>

<P>BEHOLD an affectionate people a&s;&s;embled in crowds, to te&s;|tify their e&s;teem and bear his body to the burial. The man|&s;ion of joy was now the &s;eat of &s;orrow. He who once en|livened the &s;cene, and brightened every object, was no longer to be found. Where is he, who once welcomed the &s;tranger to his hall? Where is the good man, who opened his door to the traveller? They looked for him in vain. The noble frame which he once animated was found; but in mournful ruins! They viewed it. They wept! Blame them not. Hearts of marble would have wept! Had you been pre&s;ent your hearts would have melted within you. They viewed it, and wept again, and weeping conveyed it to the tomb!</P>
<P>LET us this day a&s;cribe righteou&s;ne&s;s to our MARER, and reverence that Being, who liveth and reigneth, while great and good men die, and the fa&s;hion of this world is pa&s;&s;ing.
