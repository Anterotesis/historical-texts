<Q>BOTH RICHES AND HONOUR COME OF THEE, AND THOU REIGNEST OVER ALL; AND IN THINE HAND IS POWER AND MIGHT; AND IN THINE HAND IT IS TO MAKE GREAT, AND TO GIVE STRENGTH UNTO ALL.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE GREAT AND BELOVED MAN IS DEAD! <HI>The light of America is extingui&s;hed:</HI> and all the enlightened friends of merit are the &s;ubjects of deep affliction. For though the Saviour of his country "Died in a good old age, full of riches and honour," yet, at this dreadful period, when the world trembles before the horrid ravages of the combined powers of darkne&s;s, the lo&s;s of WASHINGTON, that able &s;tate&s;man and unrivalled General, is like the de|parture of the &s;un in his zenith, and matter of great la|mentation. Re&s;ignedly, therefore, to mourn the event be|fore God, "who killeth and maketh alive," and pay our tribute of re&s;pect to the memory of him who&s;e &s;ame has filled the world and will forever grace the mo&s;t in&s;tructive page of hi&s;tory, is the pre&s;ent duty of every cla&s;s and de|&s;cription of men.</P>
<P>To aid a devout and corre&s;pondent cour&s;e of exerci&s;es and reflections, at this &s;olemn &s;ea&s;on, by illu&s;trating THE DI|VINE INFLUENCE IN HUMAN GREATNESS, &s;hall be the employment of the &s;ub&s;equent di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="038547_0005_1012553EC4FD67A0">
THE text and the occa&s;ion we tru&s;t obviou&s;ly meet, and readily harmonize. For, if the Divine Being is the author of Human Greatne&s;s, we ought gratefully to acknow|ledge it, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively hold our peace before the dark di&s;pen&s;ation of providence. Tho&s;e, who are qualified to ble&s;s God for rai&s;ing up Great Men, are equally qualified to adore his name when they are removed. For Chri&s;tian gratitude and re&s;ignation are in&s;eparably connected, during our probationary &s;tate.</P>
<P>THAT, God is the author of Human Greatne&s;s, it is manife&s;t, becau&s;e men as well as worms of the earth, and even the angels of light are creatures, and con&s;equently dependent on the creator. In every po&s;&s;ible attitude, mode and &s;tate, creatures are ab&s;olutely dependent. Longer than the duration of his dependence, no being can remain a creature. It is impo&s;&s;ible for the mo&s;t exalted creatures to &s;urvive their dependence: Dependence, ab&s;olute depen|dence on God in all re&s;pects, is in&s;eparable from the exi&s;t|ence of man. For whether wi&s;e or &s;imple they are the workman&s;hip of God. Hence the voice of in&s;piration: "Both riches and honour come of thee; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give &s;trength unto all. For promotion cometh neither from the ea&s;t nor from the we&s;t nor from the &s;outh; But God is Judge, he putteth down one and &s;etteth up another. The Lord changeth the times and &s;ea&s;ons; he removeth kings and &s;etteth up kings; he giveth wi&s;dom to the wi&s;e and under&s;tanding to tho&s;e that know under&s;tand|ing.
<PB N="7" REF="038547_0006_1012554133CB7DB0">
The heart of the king is in the hand of the Lord and he turneth it whither&s;oever he plea&s;eth as the rivers of water are turned." Rea&s;on, philo&s;ophy and in&s;piration unitedly con&s;pire to impre&s;s the doctrine, that God is the author of Human Greatne&s;s. For all men, from the womb to the grave, are wholly dependent on God through all the vici&s;&s;itudes of life. "The lot is ca&s;t into the lap, but the whole di&s;po&s;ing thereof is of the Lord." Independently of the divine agency we "Cannot make one hair white nor black. For in God we live, and move, and have our being, and in him are all our ways. O Lord, I know that the way of man is not in him&s;elf: it is not in man that walk|eth to direct his &s;teps." This is a general view of the &s;ub|ject; but ju&s;tice, on this great occa&s;ion, requires a more particular con&s;ideration.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> GOD is the author of Human Greatne&s;s, by fur|ni&s;hing tho&s;e who are ordained to move in the mo&s;t elevated &s;pheres of action with an an&s;werable &s;ource of genius. The foundation of human greatne&s;s is laid by the Creator in that depth of genius, which is not the common lot of the gene|ral ma&s;s of man. The genius of Cyrus, Newton and oth|ers, who&s;e fame will keep pace with time, is imparted by the forming hand of God to tho&s;e who&s;e de&s;tination requires it: and, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary is a rich &s;ource of genius to attain hu|man greatne&s;s, that no man de&s;titute of it can excel. Com|mon abilities, by diligent and painful application, will make a reputable figure by the &s;ide of great men; but cannot a&s;cend the &s;ummit of human greatne&s;s. Glimmering &s;tars
<PB N="8" REF="038547_0007_10125542D35D9888">
never &s;hine like the &s;un. Men, who&s;e genius is calculated to conduct them &s;afely amid the luminaries of heaven, with great facility reach that height of &s;cience, which others cannot by the mo&s;t unwearied indu&s;try, during the com|pa&s;s of human life. All great men command great abil|ities; and the greate&s;t manife&s;tly command the be&s;t abil|ities. Genius is the peculiar foundation on which celebra|ted characters have rai&s;ed their a&s;toni&s;hing &s;uper&s;tructures. This being manife&s;t, it is al&s;o equally manife&s;t that God is the author of human greatne&s;s by the profu&s;e donation of genius. For who has made the difference between the &s;imple man and the great Philo&s;opher? Who, &s;ays the &s;im|ple cottager to the man of &s;cience, made thy abilities? and who made mine? Has not the &s;kilful and &s;overeign hand of the creator made the wide difference between us? Let me, then be humble and contented: and be thou thank|ful and under&s;tanding. For of tho&s;e, to whom much is given, much will be required. Great men in this world ought to be great in the next. This leads us to add,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> THE agency of God is directly concerned in human greatne&s;s by amply furni&s;hing the favoured &s;ons of genius with an an&s;werable education. Unle&s;s &s;ea&s;onably cultivated the be&s;t natural abilities will not con&s;titute human greatne&s;s. De&s;titute of education, a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the genius of an angel will never excel. The mo&s;t co&s;tly teints of the ea&s;t, except di&s;played by a fini&s;hed pencil, will not approach the perfection of nature: the fine&s;t piece of mar|ble, except formed and poli&s;hed by the unerring hand of
<PB N="9" REF="038547_0008_101255454C877D30">
the &s;culptor, will neither exhibit an elegant monument, nor bu&s;t: and thus that ponderous ma&s;s of genius, which God liberally imparts to &s;ome of the human race, will forever remain dormant and comparatively u&s;ele&s;s, except rou&s;ed, invigorated and directed by education. How many men of genius are there among the rude Africans? How many among the wild &s;avages of America? How many among the common people of our acquaintance, who, while de&s;titute of generous education, yet di&s;cover &s;ome of the prime marks of original genius? The flint is full of fire; but &s;ome exertion is nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;play the &s;parks. Now, we a&s;k, what rai&s;ed Newton with &s;uch celerity from the ob&s;curity of an awkward, ignorant boy to that immortal height amid the &s;pheres? The an&s;wer is education. What with &s;uch rapidity has di&s;tingui&s;hed many writers, &s;tates|men and generals from their equals both in point of age and genius? Education. The influence of education makes the difference in a great mea&s;ure, which is &s;o obvious, between this nation and that, this family and that, and even between this man and the other who, when infants, were nouri&s;hed together by the &s;ame brea&s;t. This in a word, other things equal, is the ground of the va&s;t differ|ence between Legi&s;lators and Barbarians, the great Philo&s;o|pher and the untutored Indian.</P>
<P>THIS point granted, that education claims the merit of making the difference between the rude and in|formed, the comparatively u&s;ele&s;s and u&s;eful cla&s;s of men, we a&s;k who is the author of that generous edu|cation
<PB N="10" REF="038547_0009_10125547EC577890">
of which &s;ome of the human race are the &s;ubjects? Shall the &s;ons of &s;cience like the <HI>dark Illuminati</HI> of the age ble&s;s the &s;tars, Jupiter or Minerva or Dame Nature or any other vanities of a demoralized heart as the beneficent author of education? The child of mode&s;ty will not venture on &s;uch daring ground. For, not to name Deity, the public mind, that reveres revelation, is entitled to &s;ome re&s;pect; and pays no &s;olemn tribute to the Fates. Are, then, the in&s;tructors at colleges and &s;chools the exclu|&s;ive authors of education? Are parents and the commu|nity the prime &s;ource of education? No, my candid audi|tors, God is the author: and our enlightened country, the in&s;tructors of colleges and &s;chools and a thou&s;and other ad|vantages which we and our children po&s;&s;e&s;s are but the in|&s;truments and means which God improves to expand the minds of men and prepare them for u&s;efulne&s;s. God maketh the children of men both wi&s;e and great. He furni&s;hes families, &s;chools and colleges with the means of in&s;truction, and by countle&s;s mea&s;ures which en|tirely e&s;cape our notice brings forward the children, the youth and the men whom he has ordained for lamps and pillars of the church and &s;tate. His attention to the education of tho&s;e intended for human greatne&s;s is marked with the infinitude of his love. The playful child at &s;chool little thinks of the high decree of heaven re&s;pecting his future &s;phere of action. Cyrus was cho&s;en, named and gird|ed by the Lord to dry up the river Euphrates, to open the two leaved gates, to break in pieces the gates of bra&s;s, to cut in &s;under the bars of iron and to de&s;troy the pride of Babylon. He was therefore educated in the &s;chool of
<PB N="11" REF="038547_0010_1012554B3303FB78">
arms both in Per&s;ia under the direction of Camby&s;es and in Media under the direction of A&s;tyages. Daniel was or|dained to ble&s;s the afflicted, captivated church in a &s;trange land and was accordingly favoured with a princely educa|tion in the royal college. Paul was brought up at the feet of Gamaliel that he might be qualified to &s;tand before the potentates of the earth and publi&s;h the re&s;urrection and the glad tidings of &s;alvation. Luther, Calvin and &s;everal others were regi&s;tered in heaven to introduce the reforma|tion, and were therefore furni&s;hed with an&s;werable informa|tion, zeal and fortitude. Their minds, nerves and hearts were formed to face the oppo&s;ition and intrigue of Charles the fifth and Francis the fir&s;t, and to confound the bi&s;hops, legates, cardinals and father of Rome. To &s;hake the foundation of the papal throne, and give his people re&s;t, was the decree of the Almighty, and by his gracious influ|ence &s;uitable agents were rai&s;ed up to execute his purpo&s;e. It is the Lord who maketh great and giveth &s;trength unto all. He forms the minds of men for the intere&s;ting parts they have to act upon the great theatre of life, and ble&s;&s;ed be his glorious name. For his wi&s;dom, power and good|ne&s;s are infinite. To illu&s;trate the divine influence in hu|man greatne&s;s, let me ob&s;erve</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> That God not only furni&s;hes men with ge|nius and education, but with ample opportunity to exert and improve their abilities. Jo&s;eph, when a blooming youth, was adverti&s;ed of his future greatne&s;s by &s;everal dreams. But not comprehending his vi&s;ions, he like a
<PB N="12" REF="038547_0011_1012554CD100C880">
child, in the &s;implicity of his heart di&s;clo&s;ed them to the family. This, as his &s;u&s;picious brethren con&s;trued his dreams in connexion with the &s;plendid coat and the partial fondne&s;s of old Jacob, was the occa&s;ion of their hating him with all the heart. They, therefore, after a fixed intention to terminate his days, the execution of which was &s;ea&s;ona|bly prevented, in the mo&s;t unbrotherly and inhuman manner, &s;old him to a company of mercile&s;s &s;trangers, who greedily made merchandi&s;e of him in Egypt. Thus the rigid hand of adver&s;ity followed the unhappy youth, without inter|mi&s;&s;ion, till he was ca&s;t into pri&s;on. The hi&s;tory is too af|fecting for per&s;ons of humanity to pur&s;ue, except they an|ticipate the event. But, why mu&s;t the lovely youth be &s;tolen from the dear embraces of his aged father by unnat|ural brethren, and plunged into the la&s;ting furnace of af|fliction? The an&s;wer is obvious; that he might &s;upply a &s;tarving world with bread, and ju&s;tify the ways of God to man. While we, therefore, grieve for the affliction of Jo|&s;eph, we cannot but rejoice in the view of his &s;uperior great|ne&s;s and excellency. To ea&s;e the in&s;upportable burden of his trembling and afflicted brothers, he therefore wi&s;ely with|out exculpating the guilty, &s;ays "For God did &s;end me before you to pre&s;erve life." By the peculiar afflictions and trials, which he long experienced, the Lord made him great. Like Chri&s;t, his great antitype, he was made perfect through &s;uffering.</P>
<P>To emancipate the oppre&s;&s;ed Hebrews from the rigour of Pharaoh, Mo&s;es the &s;ervant of God was born with a great
<PB N="13" REF="038547_0012_1012554F49C25638">
mind, and educated in a princely &s;tyle at the court of Egypt. The ever watchful eye of heaven was upon him from the moment he e&s;caped the bloody hand of the executioner, by being concealed among the flags till his education was compleated: For he was the goodly child who&s;e face di&s;|played the peculiar features of future greatne&s;s. As &s;oon, therefore, as the period arrived for him to di&s;cover his abili|ties by the mo&s;t noble exertions, God led him into the &s;chool of affliction. In circum&s;tances of adver&s;ity Mo&s;es began to exhibit his talents and unfold the great de&s;ign of heaven re&s;pecting his future dignity. When he termina|ted the &s;trife between the Hebrew and the Egyptian; when he returned from the burning, emblematic bu&s;h to authenticate his divine legation before Egypt's proud and inflexible king; when amid the plagues and horrors of the land he cho&s;e the affliction of God's people rather than all the honours and emoluments of the world; when he led the reluctant, complaining nation of I&s;rael to the fright|ful margin of the dividing &s;ea; when we behold the man executing his part of the great deliverance, we are dazzled with the &s;plendour of his greatne&s;s: For he &s;hines brighte&s;t in the furnace of affliction. He became great by the difficulties he removed, by the ob&s;tacles he &s;ur|mounted and by the trials he endured. He was de&s;tined by God to di&s;pel the night, and ri&s;e and &s;hine like the opening day. In honour, therefore, to the memory of the righteous, which is precious, when he had fini&s;hed his cour&s;e, the Lord &s;aid to Jo&s;hua, his prime mini&s;ter: "Mo|&s;es my &s;ervant is dead." The Eulogy is &s;hort but divine|ly
<PB N="14" REF="038547_0013_10125552C8461E48">
&s;entimental. More would be &s;uperfluous and le&s;s defi|cient. Ble&s;&s;ed are tho&s;e who de&s;erve the approbation of God. Jo&s;hua, that &s;potle&s;s character al&s;o became the great and excellent &s;tate&s;man and general in con&s;equence of being confined by Jehovah to the practical &s;chool of war. His peculiar circum&s;tances in the cour&s;e of events made him the peerle&s;s general: For upon him devolved the great work of di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the heathens, and planting Jacob in the promi&s;ed land.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame cour&s;e of providence put the &s;word of the Lord into the hand of Gideon, and inve&s;ted him with hu|man greatne&s;s. While thre&s;hing wheat at Ophrah to hide it from the ravaging enemy, he was called by the angel of God to be the deliverer of his nation. He obeyed the com|mand, he quitted his work, he marched, he accompli&s;hed the divine purpo&s;e, and is enrolled among the great men who&s;e peculiar embarra&s;&s;ments and afflictions gave them op|portunity to expre&s;s their valour and dignity.</P>
<P>DAVID, in this connexion, mu&s;t not be pa&s;&s;ed by in &s;ilence. For the exten&s;ive field of action into which he was called from the &s;imple employment of a &s;hepherd obviou&s;ly crowned him with human greatne&s;s. He was born for the day in which he lived, and his abilities were adequate to the arduous ta&s;k re&s;erved for him by providence; but as gold is proved and purified by fire; &s;o David's &s;uperior greatne&s;s was di&s;played in con&s;equence of the pe|culiar dangers and evils which he experienced. Though
<PB N="15" REF="038547_0014_1012555535FAC960">
no merit can be imputed to his enemies, we cannot but re|mark that they, under the direction of providence, were the occa&s;ion of his &s;uperlative honour both in the field and on the throne.</P>
<P>WE have previou&s;ly taken notice of the agency of God relative to the education of Daniel&punc; whom he formed for the &s;ubject of human greatne&s;s. But we have equal liber|ty to ob&s;erve, in this connexion, that the great dangers and calamities, to which Daniel and his captivated friends were expo&s;ed, made them great and di&s;tingui&s;hed characters. From Babel's den of lions and burning furnace the page of in&s;piration furni&s;hes the greate&s;t and be&s;t of human cha|racters. For the&s;e di&s;plays of excellency we are not in|debted to their enemies, but to the God of heaven.</P>
<P>WE will mention but one in&s;tance more. It was the peculiar &s;cene of difficulty, affliction, danger and di&s;tre&s;s to which the Apo&s;tles and primitive chri&s;tians were &s;ubjec|ted, which gave them opportunity to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves &s;o gloriou&s;ly in favour of the cau&s;e of Chri&s;t. God gave them abilities and information as their mi&s;&s;ion required, and in the cour&s;e of events gave them full opportunity to di&s;play their excellency. By the divine agency, in this manner, all great men have been formed; and a&s;ide from this cour&s;e of operation there have been but few great men on earth.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly.</HI> GOD is the author of human greatne&s;s, by
<PB N="16" REF="038547_0015_10125556D5915108">
directing men to embrace and diligently pur&s;ue tho&s;e em|ployments which corre&s;pond with their abilities. "Nature, &s;ays a celebrated author, has thought fit to make a di&s;tribu|tion of her talents among men. She has pitched upon &s;ome particular per&s;ons, to give them aptitude to perform rightly &s;ome things which &s;he has not rendered po&s;&s;ible to others. Nature indeed has made an unequal di&s;tribution of her ble&s;&s;ings among her children; yet &s;he has di&s;inherit|ted none; and a man dive&s;ted of all kinds of abilities is as great a phenomenon as an univer&s;al genius." The&s;e ob&s;er|vations merit attention; but, as no man can be the &s;ubject of common information who will not li&s;ten to the voice of in&s;truction; &s;o, the greate&s;t genius will not excel, in his proper &s;phere of action, unle&s;s he diligently applies. Noth|ing &s;hort of well directed attention to his own particular employment will make the child of genius a man of emi|nence. He who attempts every thing will accompli&s;h nothing. It is frequently &s;aid that &s;ome men are born poets, others, mu&s;icians and others, generals. The remark is not groundle&s;s. But the import is neither more nor le&s;s than this, that they are the &s;ubjects of peculiar aptitude of genius for their re&s;pective &s;pheres of employment. For we all know that no man will excel in poetry, mu&s;ic or the field of war, who is de&s;titute of diligent application. The all attentive providence of God permits none to excel but the diligent. The diligent hand maketh rich; but drow&s;ine&s;s will clothe a man with rags. In but few in|&s;tances is the hand of divine agency more con&s;picuous, than in directing &s;ome men who&s;e motives will not bear exam|ination
<PB N="17" REF="038547_0016_10125559850DCED8">
to excel in tho&s;e arts and &s;ciences which are &s;o ben|eficial to the world. How many thou&s;ands of bold &s;oldiers are there in the bloody field of battle who have no reli&s;h for the di&s;cipline of Chri&s;t? The &s;erious and con&s;oling con|&s;ideration is this, that whether men of genius or &s;implicity choo&s;e or refu&s;e to be influenced by good motives, God will improve them to magnify his great name. "For he hath made all things for him&s;elf, yea even the wicked for the day of evil. The wrath of man &s;hall prai&s;e the Lord, and the remainder thereof he will re&s;train."</P>
<P>BUT, the field opened by the &s;ubject is too exten&s;ive to be farther explored in this di&s;cour&s;e. Let us, however, remark in connexion with the preceding ob&s;ervations, that the circum&s;tances and events which concur in the cour&s;e of providence to con&s;titute a great character, are innumerable. As many things are nece&s;&s;arily effected by God to furni&s;h a piece of bread; &s;o many more are effected to clothe a man with human greatne&s;s. Divine agency does not make a great man in a day. God &s;pends more time in making a great general or &s;tate&s;man than was &s;pent in making the worlds. All the events and circum&s;tances connected with the infant, the child, the youth and the man, are under the direction of God in order to con&s;titute human greatne&s;s. Hence David, the renowned king of I&s;rael, while contem|plating the character of God, who formed him, and qual|ified him for great actions and placed him upon the throne, in this mo&s;t devout and humble manner celebrates the di|vine prai&s;e: "Both riches and honour come of thee; and
<PB N="18" REF="038547_0017_1012555CCDDC8DB0">
thou reigne&s;t over all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to make great and to give &s;trength unto all. But who am I and what is my father's hou&s;e."</P>
<P>LET us now improve the &s;ubject by &s;everal inferences and reflections an&s;werable to the &s;olemnity of the oc|ca&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> WE infer the &s;overeignty of God in the unequal di&s;tribution of natural abilities to the children of men. For the inequality among men, in point of genius, is as obvious as any thing in nature. To &s;ome God gives great natural abilities, to others &s;mall ones, and to many others genius of the moderate &s;ize; and who &s;hall complain of the un|equal di&s;tribution? Has the prince of angels rea&s;on to com|plain, that his mind is not equal to the mind of the creator? Shall Newton complain, that he was not made an angel? Shall the lea&s;t mind of the human race complain of not be|ing the greate&s;t? For if all men were generals, the field would be de&s;titute of &s;oldiers; and if all men were angels, the world would be de&s;titute of inhabitants. The infinitude of the divine wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s mu&s;t &s;ilence every com|plaint of the nature. For God knows be&s;t what agents to employ, and in what manner to accompli&s;h his glorious pur|po&s;e by the creation.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> WE infer the &s;overeignty of God in the un|equal di&s;tribution of the advantages of education. A large proportion of mankind are now in a &s;avage &s;tate. Many
<PB N="19" REF="038547_0018_1012555F410CF390">
others, in con&s;equence of their &s;ituation, are almo&s;t de&s;ti|tute of the common means of information. Comparatively, the bible and the rudiments of knowledge are in but few hands at the pre&s;ent day. But while we lament the igno|rant &s;tate of the generality of men, we &s;ee &s;ome of the race favoured with the peculiar advantages of erudition. Why this &s;triking difference between man and man, one nation and another? For all men are equally dependent. Has God made the great Philo&s;opher and the ignorant &s;avage of the mountains? Has he furni&s;hed the one with the wings of a &s;eraph to &s;oar amid the &s;tars and left the other to roam the fore&s;t like the leopard? Why this great inequal|ity amid the offspring of man? For God is as able to make one man the &s;ubject of human greatne&s;s as another. But the objection is ea&s;ily invalidated, in the view of every im|partial and informed mind. For God is light and love; and if variety and contra&s;t were not nece&s;&s;arily connected with the great intere&s;t of eternity, neither light, nor dark|ne&s;s, nor land, nor water, nor men, nor angels, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature would exi&s;t. But, who will pre&s;umptuou&s;ly a&s;&s;ert that creation is de&s;titute of value and will in the final i&s;&s;ue of events tarni&s;h the honour of the creator? For God has made angels and men and all other objects, and governs them according to the coun&s;el of his own will to an&s;wer the be&s;t end. Be &s;ilent then, O man, and remember, that the difference between the genius and information of one man and another, is the fruit of in|finite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s. Shall not God do what he will with his own? Is thine eye evil becau&s;e God is good?
<PB N="20" REF="038547_0019_10125560DAC4B4F8">
Is not the univer&s;e the property of God? and who &s;hall teach the proprietor of all things what improvement to make of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions? Let us adore the Divine Being and en|joy the perfection of his admini&s;trations. For, while God makes the difference between the mind and information of one man and another, his requirements invariably cor|re&s;pond with the advantages which he confers.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> WE infer the peculiar darkne&s;s of the pre&s;ent di&s;pen&s;ation of providence. For <HI>Wa&s;hington,</HI> the corner &s;tone of the American fabric, is removed. The Lord gave him to the nation and the Lord hath taken him away. Had he &s;urvived his abilities and u&s;efulne&s;s and become a burden to him&s;elf and friends, the public mind would be very differently affected by his departure. But, he did not out live him&s;elf. For though he almo&s;t reached the com|mon limits of life, yet till death arrived he retained that maje&s;ty of mind and vigour of body which he enjoyed in the active period of man. Like the declining &s;un who&s;e undimini&s;hed orb cheers the world at the clo&s;e of day, &s;o the light of America retained his verticle greatne&s;s and &s;plendour, even at the hori&s;on of human life. We have therefore, lo&s;t the great &s;tate&s;man, the deep coun&s;ellor, the un&s;haken patriot, the matchle&s;s general and the man of &s;cience who&s;e &s;ame has filled the world. While other great captains have blazed like the lightening to de&s;troy, he like the &s;un &s;hone to protect and pre&s;erve. Beloved by his country and revered by her enemies, he led our arms to victory and final conque&s;t without wading through rivers

of blood: And never, except at the doleful period of the war, when he commanded the di&s;couraged, de&s;titute and bleeding army, who&s;e influence cheered their &s;inking hearts, was <HI>Wa&s;hington's</HI> pre&s;ence more needed than at this dark period. The Pre&s;ident and Congre&s;s mourn the termina|tion of his coun&s;el and direction and the army laments the lo&s;s of his military arrangements. The States at large pre&s;ent di&s;tingui&s;hed tokens of the deepe&s;t &s;orrow in con&s;e|quence of his death, and we ardently hope that the increa&s;|ing influence of our enemies, at home and abroad may not teach us in the heat of war to realize our pre&s;ent profe&s;&s;ions. For the trump of war would, if po&s;&s;ible, rou&s;e <HI>Wa&s;hington</HI> from his tomb, once more to direct our arms and &s;ave Ame|rica. Though we have confidence in our generals, yet if called to arms we &s;hould in ca&s;e of di&s;couragement and di&s;|tre&s;s, greatly need his pre&s;ence and military addre&s;s. We &s;till remember, that during the mo&s;t dangerous period of the late war his per&s;onal influence effected more than could be effected by Congre&s;s or the power of the &s;tates. But, alas, he has left the field of action! He has dropped his ar|mour. His victorious &s;word is &s;afely &s;u&s;pended as a pecu|liar memorial of the conqueror. But let us not injure his a&s;hes by extravagant tears. Rather let us &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively re|member, that the God of armies has di&s;mi&s;&s;ed our General from the field; and let us wi&s;ely improve the providence. Let us &s;ympathize and condole like chri&s;tians with the be|loved and bereaved Lady of our late General. Her afflic|tion is great becau&s;e her lo&s;s is great. She weeps freely, but no earthly friend can con&s;ole her broken heart. Let

us then beg God to vi&s;it her lonely man&s;ion, which is full of &s;orrow, with his gracious pre&s;ence; and &s;end a condoling angel to wipe away her willing tears as they flow from the fountain of grief. Let us mourn with the Pre&s;ident; for he has lo&s;t the man who diligently travelled by his &s;ide through the wide and hazardous field of public life. Let us condole with the American &s;oldiers, who have lo&s;t the General who&s;e pre&s;ence and martial di&s;po&s;itions were the confidence of battle and the preludes of victory and triumph. Let us mourn with our country that her great luminary &s;hone no longer. For we need his beams to di&s;pel the di&s;mal night in which we are involved. While the ene|mies of America will clap their hands and &s;tamp with their feet and rejoice with all their heart to hear that <HI>Wa&s;hington</HI> has clo&s;ed his eyes, let us be humble that we need the af|fliction. For he was worth ten thou&s;and other men. In his brea&s;t, face and deportment there was the influence of an army. Our dome&s;tic and di&s;tant enemies have much le&s;s to fear at pre&s;ent from our arms, than before he re&s;igned the command to the me&s;&s;enger of heaven. For he was able to in&s;pire his country with fortitude, when ready to de&s;pair. O how did his &s;ea&s;onable addre&s;&s;es, in the cour&s;e of the war animate the hearts of the people and add vigour and energy to the authority of the &s;tates! In the darke&s;t times his wi&s;dom guided Congre&s;s and his influence &s;up|ported the union. Not to derogate from the dignity of others, <HI>Wa&s;hington</HI> was the grand &s;pring of the Federal Ma|chine. We lately experienced his influence when di&s;cour|agement &s;eized our minds in con&s;equence of the daring in|&s;olence
<PB N="23" REF="038547_0022_10125565C92BC358">
of France. The public mind, when it was judged nece&s;&s;ary to rai&s;e an army, was highly agitated, and in a trembling manner began to anticipate the horrors of a French war. The pro&s;pect was gloomy; for the Ameri|cans in the full enjoyment of liberty were aver&s;e from war. But upon Wa&s;hington's accepting the command of the army, the gloom was di&s;pelled. Every bo&s;om beat with joy and the public face appeared cheerful, when the Hero expre&s;&s;ed his readine&s;s to quit the evening plea&s;ures of life for the hard&s;hips and dangers of the field. The event at once created both officers and &s;oldiers and organized a re&s;pectable army; for the proved veterans, who&s;e &s;trength was not exhau&s;ted by following him during the late &s;ucce&s;sful war, were emulou&s;ly engaged to enjoy his command. The account of Wa&s;hington's being at the head of the army no &s;ooner reached us, than even the little boys were fired with the martial &s;pirit and paraded the &s;treets as though they thir&s;ted for the honour of battle. His &s;ame, in a word, has made an army of little &s;oldiers, who are determined never to &s;urvive the liberty of their country. For this token of good we are indebted to the peculiar influence of that military genius who &s;till lives in the ri&s;ing, expanding mind of America. But alas the He|ro is gone! The mo&s;t able and &s;ucce&s;sful general in the world lies in the du&s;t! How are the weapons of war peri&s;hed! Let us mourn; let us be &s;kilful in lamentation. For he was conducted into the field and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from it, by the Lord of Ho&s;ts, who directs the armies of heaven and all the inhabitants of the earth.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="038547_0023_1012556915440BC8">
<HI>Fourthly.</HI> If God is the author of human greatne&s;s, let us be thankful for Wa&s;hington the di&s;tingui&s;hed in&s;trument of his goodne&s;s to America. Being ordained for the mo&s;t renouned character, God furni&s;hed him with a great mind and a corre&s;pondent education. A&s;ide from the te&s;timony of many learned characters with whom he was long and intimately connected both in private and public life, his writings and actions exhibit ample evidence that he was a man of great genius and erudition. The&s;e nece&s;&s;ary foun|dations of future greatne&s;s being laid, God gave him early opportunity to exert his abilities and di&s;play his worth. In 1755, he was Colonel of a regiment under General Brad|dock who commanded an army near the Allegany moun|tains, for the purpo&s;e of repelling the combined force of French and Indians. Braddock was a European officer, an enthu&s;ia&s;t for di&s;cipline; but by no means qualified, as he &s;corned the advantage of fighting behind rocks and trees, to meet an army of &s;kulking Indians. Young Wa&s;hington, who was well acquainted with ambu&s;h fighting, it is &s;aid, advi&s;ed him better than to expo&s;e his army in battle, in open &s;ight of the &s;kulking, invi&s;ible foe of the wilderne&s;s. But Braddock, who was not afraid to fight Indians at mid|night with a lanthorn in his hand, &s;purred his hor&s;e and led on his troops. Suddenly, but not unexpectedly to Col. Wa&s;hington, the Indians fired upon the vanguard of the army which immediately fell back in confu&s;ion on the main body and the panic became general. Bold Braddock with the greate&s;t ob&s;tinacy remained on the &s;pot calling to order while his officers were falling thick around, until he had &s;everal hor&s;es &s;hot under him. At length he received a ball
<PB N="25" REF="038547_0024_1012556AB0EC79A0">
through his lungs and dropped, and total confu&s;ion en&s;ued. With &s;uch bold generals Indians choo&s;e to fight. Alas for the day. But then, then was the time for the martial foul of <HI>Wa&s;hington</HI> to di&s;play it&s;elf. Then in the mid&s;t of the dying groans of brave men and the horrid &s;hout of &s;av|age conque&s;t God began to rai&s;e him above other officers. His direct cour&s;e to future greatne&s;s in the field was point|ed out. For the young colonel took the command and guided the wounded and vanqui&s;hed troops &s;afely through the dangers of the wilderne&s;s. Till that di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;cene neither he nor his country knew the va&s;t re&s;ource of his military genius.</P>
<P>IN con&s;equence of making this retreat, and other ex|ploits, he was nece&s;&s;arily, at the commencement of the re|volution, appointed by Congre&s;s commander of the Ame|rican army. In the &s;ummer, 1775, he took the command of the undi&s;ciplined troops at Cambridge, but too late to direct and improve the military abilities of Warren and other brave men who&s;e memory will &s;urvive the marble pil|lars and monuments on which their names are in&s;cribed.</P>
<P>THOUGH a minute detail of <HI>Wa&s;hington's</HI> atchieve|ments from the commencement to the termination of the war is not expected from the pulpit, yet the occa&s;ion re|quires a &s;ummary: for gratitude will retain his doings and &s;ufferings in favour of his country. The mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing ad|ver&s;ity nece&s;&s;arily attended his fir&s;t efforts, in con&s;equence of confronting di&s;ciplined Britains with undi&s;ciplined Ame|ricans, who&s;e term of &s;ervice was too &s;hort to &s;ea&s;on their
<PB N="26" REF="038547_0025_1012556D261F1FF0">
bodies and form their minds for the field. The General had more to fear from the contracted inli&s;tments and &s;up|plies of his own army than from the whole force of the en|emy. He reque&s;ted of his country nothing but patience and a permanent army properly &s;upplied. "<HI>Furni&s;h us with men and provi&s;ions, and by the ble&s;&s;ing of Providence, we &s;hall &s;ecure our liberty,</HI>" was the import of his melting ad|dre&s;&s;es to the public. But what tongue or pen can fully de&s;cribe the embarra&s;&s;ments and ob&s;tacles with which he &s;truggled, in con&s;equence of not being properly &s;upported? His di&s;tre&s;&s;ing flight through the Jer&s;eys in '76, at the head of a handful of di&s;couraged men, with elated Britains at his heels, is &s;till fre&s;h in the memory of Americans: for, in&s;tead of dive&s;ting him of general&s;hip, it only rou&s;ed his great mind and prepared him for the &s;hout of cardinal vic|tory which he immediately gained both at Trenton and Princeton. If we recall his military condition in the middle &s;tates, where he made the mo&s;t intere&s;ting exertions and was &s;ubjected to the greate&s;t afflictions to defend his coun|try, while the balance of victory remained long in a wavering, doubtful &s;tate, we are a&s;toni&s;hed at the man: for his wi&s;|dom, fortitude and per&s;everance all &s;hine &s;uperlatively bright. Neither of his military talents can be extolled be|yond the re&s;t: for his peculiar a&s;&s;emblage of abilities ap|proaches the perfection of the &s;oldier. In a word, while we follow him both in pro&s;perity and adver&s;ity, through the &s;tates, during the war, and remember his exten&s;ive ar|rangements from north to &s;outh, while the weight of em|pire re&s;ted on his &s;houlders, we are filled with admiration before the &s;tandard of human greatne&s;s. For, though he
<PB N="27" REF="038547_0026_101255707329FDF0">
had &s;acrificed his ea&s;e and intere&s;t, and diligently &s;pent the mo&s;t valuable period of his days in the mid&s;t of the ex|treme labour, hard&s;hip, &s;ufferings and dangers of the field to defend his country, yet when his work was done, like a patriot, he declined any pecuniary con&s;ideration. The &s;al|vation of America was his reward; and in&s;tead of &s;tyling him&s;elf Emperor of America before he di&s;banded his &s;uc|ce&s;sful, di&s;ciplined army, he in a flood of tears, thanked his brave officers and &s;oldiers for their faithful &s;ervice in the cau&s;e of liberty, dropped his &s;word, congratulated his coun|try, &s;tyled him&s;elf GEORGE WASHINGTON, and returned to Mount Vernon. On his own plantation, at a di&s;tance from the cla&s;h of arms and the concerns of public life, we behold the <HI>Virginia Farmer.</HI> But the author of great men does not permit long retirement, becau&s;e they are rai&s;ed up to direct great concerns. Wa&s;hington was, therefore, call|ed by the &s;uffrages of the &s;tates to the Pre&s;idency of the Union. To gratify a fond nation that hailed him as the Saviour of his country, he accepted the office and pre&s;ided as chief magi&s;trate, at a dark period, in the mo&s;t dignified manner, till he was tired of the weight of the public, and once more retired. But once more he was recalled from his delightful retirement into the field of war; and final|ly, he was &s;ummoned from the field of war to re&s;ign his armour, not to the nation, but to the God of armies, and to &s;leep in the du&s;t. The author of his matchle&s;s greatne&s;s has long improved him as the grand in&s;trument of his mercy to this nation and to the world, and wi&s;ely terminated his career.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="038547_0027_10125572E5E53BA0">
WHILE, then, we honour the memory of the <HI>creature,</HI> let us, with all the heart HONOUR THE CREATOR. For God is the author of human greatne&s;s. Let us al&s;o look to the Lord for other <HI>Wa&s;hingtons</HI> to fill the cabinet and command the field. If we tru&s;t in the Lord he will be our rock and &s;alvation.</P>
