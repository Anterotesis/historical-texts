<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT will be readily acknowledged, that the minds of youth are greatly attracted by <HI>novelty</HI> and <HI>variety;</HI> and that the mo&s;t judicious Collections, however entertaining they may be at fir&s;t, become le&s;s plea&s;ing by being frequent|ly peru&s;ed.</P>
<P>I have, for a number of ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rs, taken con&s;iderable pains to collect&punc; a variety of delightful and u&s;eful materials for this work. Great care has been token, to avoid the in&s;er|tion of &s;uch pieces as have appeared in former compilations for the u&s;e of Schools.</P>
<P>That a collection of this kind, appropriated &s;olely to the benefit and amu&s;ement of the <HI>fair &s;ex,</HI> would be exceeding|ly u&s;eful to Schools, has been frequently &s;ugge&s;ted by a number of literary friends, and likewi&s;e by &s;everal judi|cious females who conduct the education of young Ladies.</P>
<P>Having been about twenty years engaged in the profe&s;|&s;ion of a Teacher, I have had many opportunities of noti|cing the di&s;po&s;itions of children; they naturally love read|ing, but cannot reli&s;h dry or profound &s;ubjects, however excellent in their kind;&mdash;they want &s;omething to delight the fancy, and fix their volatility: How far this Collec|tion is calculated to an&s;wer the&s;e ends, is left to a di&s;cern|ing Public to decide.</P>
<P>It may be proper to ob&s;erve here, that &s;ome alterations have been made in a number of the following pieces, with a view of adapting them to the pre&s;ent undertaking; but as the original &s;entiments are &s;till retained, I tru&s;t, the Authors, from whom they are &s;elected, will readily par|don this nece&s;&s;ary freedom.</P>
<P>Having neglected to di&s;tingui&s;h the different pieces in this work, at the time they were &s;elected, with the names of the re&s;pective Authors,&mdash;as I then de&s;igned them only for the u&s;e of the young Ladies under my care,&mdash;I regret that it is not now practicable wholly to remedy the omi&s;&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTORY HINTS, RELATIVE TO <HI>POETRY</HI> AND THE <HI>MUSES.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<P>A <HI>POEM</HI> is a complete and fini&s;hed piece of poetry:&mdash;The &s;ort of ver&s;es that are chiefly u&s;ed in our poetry, are tho&s;e of <HI>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, eight</HI> and <HI>&s;even</HI> &s;yllables.</P>
<P>There are various kinds of poetry in u&s;e; the mo&s;t con&s;iderable are&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Pa&s;toral,</HI> that de&s;cribes a &s;hepherd's life, or that of rural nymphs and &s;wains.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Elegy,</HI> is a mournful poem, or funeral &s;ong.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Lyric poetry,</HI> is generally u&s;ed in the compo&s;ition of odes and &s;ongs.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Pindaric,</HI> is a &s;ort of poetry which con&s;i&s;ts of loo&s;e and free numbers, and unequal mea&s;ure.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Satire,</HI> is a free, joco&s;e, witty and &s;harp poem, &s;everely inveighing again&s;t vice and all corrupt man|ners and per&s;ons.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Comedy,</HI> is an agreeable imitation of the actions, humours and cu&s;toms of common life.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Tragedy,</HI> in which the calamities of illu&s;trious per&s;ons are repre&s;ented, and their actions acted over again.</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>Epic or Heroic Poem,</HI> is a poetical narrative of &s;ome illu&s;trious and important actions of the hero cel|ebrated in the poem.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>Epigram,</HI> is an inferior kind of poem, who&s;e pe|culiar character is brevity, beauty, and a &s;harp turn of wit at the end.</P>

<HEAD>OF THE <HI>MUSES.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The <HI>Mu&s;es</HI> had &s;everal names given them by the ancient poets, according to the different places where they dwelt, Sometimes they were called <HI>Pierides,</HI> on

<P>They are repre&s;ented by the poets&mdash;as very young, v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry hand&s;ome, and adorned with garlands of flowers.</P>
<P>The <HI>Mu&s;es</HI> were winged, to &s;hew the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of <HI>good wilts,</HI> and the quickne&s;s of p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">etry and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, in moving the <HI>affections:</HI>&mdash;they bore <HI>pal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, to &s;hew that they conquered mens' <HI>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ions.</HI></P>
<P>The mu&s;es are repre&s;ented as all dancing in a ring&punc; to &s;hew the agreement and harmony among the <HI>liberal &s;ciences:</HI> and the graces were joined with them, to &s;hew the &s;olid joy that is the con&s;tant attendant on LEARNING and VIRTUE.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>To recite ver&s;e with propriet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to ob|&s;erve the few following rules:</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. All the words &s;hould be pronounced exactly the &s;ame as in pro&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. The movement of the voice &s;hould be from <HI>ac|cent</HI> to <HI>accent,</HI> laying no &s;tre&s;s on the intermediate &s;yl|lables.</P>
<P N="3">3. There &s;hould be the &s;ame ob&s;ervation of <HI>empha&s;is,</HI> and the &s;ame change of notes on the emphatic &s;ylla|bles, as in reading pro&s;e.</P>
<P N="4"><PB REF="037446_0007_100D0CA0532CA548">4. The pau&s;es relative to the &s;en&s;e only, which I call &s;entential, are to be ob&s;erved in the &s;ame manner as in pro&s;e; but particular attention mu&s;t be given to tho&s;e two peculiar to ver&s;e, the <HI>cen&s;ural</HI> and <HI>final,</HI> which I call <HI>mu&s;ical pau&s;es.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. The u&s;ual faults of introducing &s;ing-&s;ong notes, or a &s;pecies of chanting i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">to poetical numbers, is di&s;|agreeable to every ear, but that of the chanter him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Readers of ver&s;e ought to con&s;ider, that they are doing great inju&s;tice to the poet's mu&s;ic, when they &s;ub&s;titute their own in its place.&mdash;The tune of the poet can then only be heard, when his ver&s;es are re|cited with &s;uch notes of the voice as re&s;ult from the &s;entiments: and a due proportion of time ob&s;erved, in the feet and pau&s;es, the con&s;tituent parts of ver&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>REMARKS ON POETRY.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1 PROPERLY to direct the human faculties, was certainly the immediate object of this &s;ublime, beautiful and u&s;eful art. We are &s;ufficiently inform|ed, that in the earlie&s;t ages morality was inculcated by Bards:&mdash;They civilized the world.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let us pur&s;ue this divine art to other eras <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">and we &s;hall find, that &s;cience and morality have been con|veyed to us through the medium of ver&s;e. That the leader of the Hebrews was a poet, is undeniable. He embelli&s;hes religion with all the &s;ublimity of imagery, and all the graces of diction. Every prophet re&s;ound|ed his prediction in &s;ublime ver&s;e.&mdash;Thus the &s;ong of Mo&s;es was a prototype of the elegant p&s;alms of David, and the &s;ublime &s;trains of I&s;aiah. It cannot be deni|ed, that poetry is highly conducive to rational plea&s;ure in every department of life; and is as capable of in|nocently amu&s;ing the fancy, as of improving the mind.</P>

<HEAD>ON MODERN FASHION.</HEAD>
<L>SOME few years ago, when &s;tays, cor&s;ets, and bodice</L>
<L>Di&s;played the fine &s;hapes of our fair Briti&s;h belles,</L>
<L>Each female po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the bright form of a godde&s;s,</L>
<L>With ro&s;es and lilies, and dimples and dells:</L>
<L>Then grandams were guided by prudence and rea&s;on,</L>
<L>And wives were all mode&s;t, yet lovely and gay;</L>
<L>Old maidens re&s;embled the wane of the &s;ea&s;on,</L>
<L>And mi&s;s in her teens a &s;weet blo&s;&s;om in May.</L>
<L>Now &s;uch is the rapid tran&s;itions of fa&s;hion,</L>
<L>That folly can govern the world at her will;</L>
<L>And each wither'd prude, like a child in a pa&s;&s;ion,</L>
<L>Thinks age may be ground into youth by a mill:</L>
<L>For &s;ince the fine wai&s;t hath mov'd up to the &s;houlder,</L>
<L>Our tabbies and grandmothers look &s;o uncouth,</L>
<L>One would think they'd tran&s;planted, a&s;ham'd to grow older,</L>
<L>Antiquity's head to the &s;houlders of youth.</L>
<L>But dre&s;s tho our ladies now cut &s;uch a da&s;h in,</L>
<L>Pray could they the impul&s;e of laughter controul,</L>
<L>To view an old &s;heep garni&s;h'd up in lamb fa&s;hion,</L>
<L>Or the plumes of a peacock adorning an owl?</L>
<L>Reflect then, ye fair, on the words of the poet,</L>
<L>Who&s;e cla&s;&s;ical talents we proudly may boa&s;t,</L>
<L>That, "Beauty needs no foreign patches to &s;how it,</L>

<HEAD>ON RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>Having in the former part of this work, attempted to re|gale my fair readers, with a variety of plea&s;ant flowers, &mdash;I would now beg leave to invite them to partake of a more &s;olid repa&s;t.</P>
<P N="1">1. THROUGH all the vici&s;&s;itudes of life, from the cradle to the grave, religion proves the never-failing friend of man. Launched on a tempe&s;tuous ocean, and buoyed up with the phantom hope, we vainly think our&s;elves &s;ecure, till the fanciful picture is withdrawn from our &s;ight, and we find the need of a more &s;olid comfort and companion. In pro&s;perity, when every thing around us wears a plea&s;ing a&s;pect, and mirth and conviviality attend our ways, con&s;cience, that intruder on &s;en&s;ual delights, interpo&s;es betwixt us and ruin, and &s;hews us the danger of weaning our mind from heaven. It is then we view the de&s;ign of tho&s;e comforts of which we are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and the re|al u&s;e, and the too frequent abu&s;e, is exhibited to our view.</P>
<P N="2">2. Diver&s;ify this &s;cene with the more melancholy idea of adver&s;ity, and all the complicated woes of life. View an aged father and a declining mother, tortured by the pangs of their &s;uffering little ones, for that &s;u&s;|tenance, which, alas! they are unable to afford; and yet, among&s;t all this accumulation of mi&s;ery, the beau|ties of religion impart animation to their dejected &s;ouls. They are con&s;oled in the remembrance of be|ing participants of the benignity of that Providence who &s;upported Elijah in the wilderne&s;s, and who is able to alleviate the horrors of their &s;ituation.</P>
<P N="3">3. Nor is the &s;uperior excellence of religion more con&s;picuous in this, than in the common occurrences of life. A mind deprived of the idea of re&s;pon&s;ibility,
<PB N="62" REF="037446_0063_100CDAC5893E8FD8">
is regardle&s;s of its conduct here; and tho' the faith|ful monitor may &s;ometimes &s;ugge&s;t an alarm, yet they proceed in a carele&s;s indifference, till at la&s;t they &s;ink into the aby&s;s of ruin.</P>
<P>Religion may be ju&s;tly called the greate&s;t enjoyment of man. It is a never-failing &s;ource of delight to tho&s;e who happily embrace its ways, as its tendency is ul|timately and &s;ecurely to po&s;&s;e&s;s felicity.</P>
<P>If &s;uch, then, appears the con&s;olations re&s;ulting from this divine perfection, how egregiou&s;ly &s;tupid do they appear, who, &s;atisfied with pre&s;ent enjoyment, are regardle&s;s of the future!</P>
<P N="4">4. In the hour of di&s;&s;olution, when all the plaudits of the world &s;hall be found ineffectual to quiet the pangs of remor&s;e, religion would admini&s;ter the mo&s;t &s;oothing ideas to their perturbed hearts. To look back on their pa&s;t exi&s;tence, is a vacuum &s;o replete with di&s;may, and time &s;o infamou&s;ly perverted, that they are petrified with horror at the awful retro&s;pect. An|ticipation of the future &s;till heightens their melancho|ly; and what would they now give, could but one hour be recalled, to make peace with that being whom they have &s;o long wantonly de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P>Could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ught &s;oar beyond the boundaries of mor|tality, and pourtray to imagination the realms of in|finity, it could not &s;ufficiently &s;hew the matchle&s;s beauties of religion.</P>
<P N="5">5. Dr. Gregory has ju&s;tly ob&s;erved that, the &s;cenes of di&s;tre&s;s, in which women are very frequently in|volved, religion is their only &s;olace and &s;upport. They cannot, when oppre&s;&s;ed by &s;orrow, or harra&s;&s;ed by worldly cares, fly to bu&s;ine&s;s or tho&s;e tumultuous plea|&s;ures which di&s;&s;ipate, if they do not calm, the mind: condemned to fight on even ground and li&s;ten to the very echo of their grief, piety alone can &s;till the mur|murs of di&s;content, and give &s;tability to their princi|ples:
<PB N="63" REF="037446_0064_100D0D4F3A67FEF0">
but piety is not to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> acquired in the hour of trouble; it mu&s;t have been a cheri&s;hed inmate of the &s;oul, or it will not not afford con&s;olation when every other &s;ource fails.</P>
<P N="6">6. The general opinion of mankind, that there is a &s;trong connection between a religious di&s;po&s;ition and a feeling heart, appears from the univer&s;al di&s;like which all men have to infidelity in the <HI>fair &s;ex.</HI> We not on|ly look upon it as removing the principal &s;ecurity we have for their virtue, but as the &s;tronge&s;t proof of their want of that &s;oftne&s;s and delicate &s;en&s;ibillty of heart, which peculiarly endears them to us, and more ef|fectually &s;ecures their empire over us, than any qua|lity they can po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Ibid.</HI></BIBL>
<P N="7">7. If young ladies, &s;ays the ingenious Mr. Cre&s;&s;|wick, would li&s;ten to me a few moments, I would endeavour to prove to them that the mo&s;t &s;edulous at|tention to the per&s;on will never improve it, whil&s;t a cultivated mind renders the mo&s;t graceful form more plea&s;ing:&mdash;What do I &s;ay?&mdash;there is no grace with|out it; nor any beauty, that will charm for half an hour, which does nor ari&s;e from an artle&s;s di&s;play of virtue or &s;en&s;e. But it is not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;peak, to di&s;play mental charms&mdash;the eye will quickly inform us if an active &s;oul re&s;ides within; and a blu&s;h is far more eloquent than the be&s;t turned period.</P>
<P N="8">8. There is &s;omething peculiarly &s;oothing and com|fortable in a firm belief that the whole frame of na|ture is &s;upported and conducted by an eternal and om|nipotent being, of infinite goodne&s;s, who intends, by the whole cour&s;e of his providence, to promote the greate&s;t good of all his creatures; a belief that we are acquainted with the means of conciliating the divine favour, and that in con&s;equence of this we have it in our power to obtain it; a belief that this life is but the infancy of our exi&s;tence, that we &s;hall &s;urvive the

<HEAD>ON THE RESURRECTION.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. I HAVE &s;een the flower withering on the &s;talk, and its bright leaves &s;pread on the ground.&mdash;I looked again, and it &s;prung up afre&s;h; the &s;tem was crowned with new buds, and the &s;weetne&s;s thereof filled the air.</P>
<P>I have &s;een the &s;un &s;et in the we&s;t, and the &s;hades of night &s;hut the wide horizon: there was no colour, nor &s;hape, nor beauty, nor mu&s;ic; gloom and dark|ne&s;s brooded around. I looked; the &s;un broke out again from the ea&s;t, and gilded the mountain tops; the lark ro&s;e to meet him from her low ne&s;t, and the &s;hades of darkne&s;s fled away.</P>
<P N="2">2. I have &s;een the in&s;ect, being come to its full &s;ize, langui&s;h, and refu&s;e to eat; it &s;pun it&s;elf a tomb, and was &s;hrowded in the &s;ilken cone; it lay without feet, or &s;hape, or power to move. I looked again; it had bur&s;t its tomb; it was full of life, and &s;ailed upon coloured wings through the &s;oft air; it rejoiced in its new being.</P>
<P>Thus &s;hall it be with thee, O man! and &s;o &s;hall thy life be renewed.&mdash;Beauty &s;hall &s;pring up out of a&s;hes, and life out of the du&s;t.&mdash;A little while &s;halt thou lie on the ground, as the &s;eed lieth in the bo&s;om of the earth:&mdash;but thou &s;halt be rai&s;ed again; and, if thou art good, thou &s;halt never die any more.</P>
<P N="3">3. Who is he that cometh to bur&s;t open the doors of the tomb; to bid the dead awake, and to gather his redeemed from the four winds of heaven? He de|&s;cendeth on a fiery cloud; the &s;ound of a trumpet go|eth before him; thou&s;ands of angels are on his right hand:&mdash;It is JESUS, the &s;on of GOD; the &s;aviour of

<HEAD>ON TRUE POLITENESS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. POLITENESS is the fir&s;t medium between form and rudene&s;s. It is the con&s;equence of a be|nevolent nature, which &s;hews it&s;elf to general ac|quaintance in an obliging uncon&s;trained civility, as it does to more particular ones in di&s;tingui&s;hed acts of kindne&s;s. This good nature mu&s;t be directed by a ju&s;tne&s;s of &s;en&s;e, and a quickne&s;s of di&s;cernment, that knows how to u&s;e every opportunity of exerci&s;ing it, and to proportion the in&s;tances of it to every charac|ter and &s;ituation.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is a re&s;traint laid by rea&s;on and benevolence upon every irregularity of the temper, which, in obe|dience to them, is forced to accommodate it&s;elf even to the fanta&s;tic cares which cu&s;tom and fa&s;hion have e&s;tabli&s;hed, if by that means it can procure in any de|gree the &s;atisfaction or good opinion of any part of mankind; thus paying an obliging deference to their judgment, &s;o far as it is not incon&s;i&s;tent with the high|er obligations of virtue and religion.</P>
<P N="3">3. This mu&s;t be accompanied with an elegance of ta&s;te, and a delicacy ob&s;ervant of the lea&s;t trifles which tend to plea&s;e or oblige; and though its foundation mu&s;t be rooted in the heart, it can &s;carce be perfect without a complete knowledge of the world. In &s;o|ciety it is the medium that blends all different tempers into the mo&s;t plea&s;ing harmony, while it impo&s;es &s;i|lence on the loquacious, and inclines the mo&s;t re&s;erved to furni&s;h their &s;hare of the conver&s;ation.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="66" REF="037446_0067_100D0D1AE7FE4418">4. It repre&s;&s;es the de&s;ire of &s;hining alone, and in|crea&s;es the de&s;ire of being mutually agreeable. It takes off the edge of raillery, and gives delicacy to wit. It pre&s;erves a proper &s;ubordination among all ranks of people, and can reconcile a perfect ea&s;e with the mo&s;t exact propriety. To &s;uperiors it appears in a re&s;pectful freedom; and no intimacy can &s;ink it into a regardle&s;s familiarity.</P>
<P N="5">5. To inferiors it &s;hews it&s;elf in an una&s;&s;uming good nature. Its aim is, to rai&s;e them to you, and not to let you down to them. It at once maintains the dignity of your &s;tation, and expre&s;&s;es the goodne&s;s of your heart. To equals it is every thing that is charming; it &s;tudies their inclinations, prevents their de&s;ires, attends to every little exactne&s;s of behaviour, and all the time appears perfectly di&s;engaged and carele&s;s.</P>
<P N="6">6. Such and &s;o amiable is true politene&s;s: by peo|ple of wrong heads and unworthy hearts di&s;graced in its two extremes: and by the generality of mankind confined within the narrow bounds of mere good breeding, which, in truth, is only one in&s;tance of it.</P>
<P N="7">7. True politene&s;s, who&s;e great end is giving real plea&s;ure, can have its &s;ource only in a virtuous and bene|volent heart. Yet this is no tall; it mu&s;t ob&s;erve pro|priety too. There is a character of perfect good na|ture, that loves to have every thing about it happy and merry.&mdash;This is a character greatly to be loved, but has little claim to the title of politene&s;s. Such per|&s;ons have no notion of freedom without noi&s;e and tu|mult: and by taking off every proper re&s;traint, and &s;inking them&s;elves to the level of their companions, even le&s;&s;en the plea&s;ure the&s;e would have in the com|pany of their &s;uperiors,</P>

<HEAD>RATIONAL LOVE.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. WE all know the power of <HI>beauty,</HI> but to ren|der it permanent and make human life more happy and agreeable, it mu&s;t have the beauties of the mind annexed. For, as Dr. Blair very ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, "Feeble are the attractions of the faire&s;t form, if no|thing <HI>within</HI> corre&s;ponds to the plea&s;ing appearance <HI>without." Love</HI> and <HI>marriage</HI> are two words much &s;poken of, but &s;eldom found united.

A young lady, being a&s;ked her opinion of <HI>love,</HI> &s;aid&mdash;"If youth and beauty are the objects of your regard, <HI>love,</HI> found|ed on youth and beauty, cannot po&s;&s;ibly endure longer than youth and beauty la&s;t.

<P N="2">2. The fir&s;t moulding of the human mind, falls &s;o naturally upon the &s;ex, that the voice of nature would have induced us to fit them for the ta&s;k, if the voice of nature had not been drowned in the clamour of our other prejudices. How &s;hall our children learn forti|tude from mothers who &s;cream at the appearance of a &s;pider? How &s;hall they learn that they are formed for their country and mankind, from mothers who know nothing of the hi&s;tory of either? How &s;hall they learn that "the mind is the &s;tandard of the man," from teachers who are forever directing their attention to their per&s;ons? How &s;hall they acquire habits of labour, and independence of &s;pirit, from tho&s;e who&s;e debility of both mind and body, unfits them for either?</P>

<HEAD>The following judicious remarks are &s;elected form a tract entitled, "<HI>Thoughts upon Female Education,</HI> ac|commodated to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety, manners, and government, in the United States." Addre&s;&s;ed to the Vi&s;itors of the young ladies' Academy, in Philadelphia, by that eminent patron of the fair &s;ex, <HI>BENJAMIN RUSH, M. D.</HI></HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THE fir&s;t remark that I &s;hall make upon this &s;ubject, is, that female education &s;hould be accommodated to the &s;tate of &s;ociety, manners, and government of the country, in which it is conducted.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal circum&s;tances in the &s;ituation, employments, and duties of women, in America, which require a peculiar mode of education.</P>
<P>The early marriages of our women, by contracting the time allowed for education, render it nece&s;&s;ary to contract its plan, and to confine it chiefly to the more u&s;eful branches of literature.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;tate of property, in America, renders it ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the greate&s;t part of our citizens to employ them&s;elves, in different occupations, for the advance|ment of their fortunes. This cannot be done without
<PB N="70" REF="037446_0071_100D0D1FE1EC20B8">
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the female members of the community. They mu&s;t be the &s;tewards and guardi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ns of their hu&s;|bands' property. That education, therefore, will be mo&s;t proper for our women, which teaches them to di&s;charge the duties of tho&s;e offices with the mo&s;t &s;uc|ce&s;s and reputation.</P>
<P N="3">3. The branch of literature mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential for a young lady, in this country, appears to be, &mdash;a know|ledge of the Engli&s;h language. She &s;hould not only read, but &s;peak and <HI>&s;pell</HI> it correctly.</P>
<P>Plea&s;ure and intere&s;t con&s;pire to make the writing of a fair and legible hand, a nece&s;&s;ary branch of female education. For this purpo&s;e &s;he &s;hould be taught not only to &s;hape every letter properly, but to pay the &s;tricte&s;t regard to points and capitals.</P>
<P>I once heard of a man who profe&s;&s;ed to di&s;cover the temper and di&s;po&s;ition of per&s;ons by looking at their hand-writing. Without enquiring into the probabili|ty of the &s;tory; I &s;hall only remark, that there is one thing in which all mankind agree, upon this &s;ubject, and that is, in con&s;idering writing that is blotted, crooked, or illegible, as a mark of vulgar education: I know of few things more rude or illiberal, than to obtrude a letter upon a per&s;on of rank or bu&s;ine&s;s, which connot be ea&s;ily read.</P>
<P N="4">4. Some knowledge of figures and book-keeping is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to qualify a young lady for the duties that await her in this country. There are certain occupations in which &s;he may a&s;&s;i&s;t her hu&s;|band with this knowledge; and &s;hould &s;he &s;urvive him, and agreeable to the cu&s;tom of our country be the executrix of his will, &s;he cannot fail of deriving immen&s;e advantages from it.</P>
<P N="5">5. An acquaintance with geography, and &s;ome in|&s;truction in chronology will enable a young lady to read hi&s;tory, biography and travels, with advantage;
<PB N="71" REF="037446_0072_100D0D59CED0ADC8">
and thereby qualify her not only for a general inter|cour&s;e with the world, but, to be an agreeable com|panion for a &s;en&s;ible man.</P>
<P>Dancing is by no means an improper branch of edu|cation for an American lady. It promotes health, and renders the figures and motions of the body ea&s;y and agreeable.</P>
<P N="6">6. The attention of our young ladies &s;hould be di|rected, as &s;oon as they are prepared for it, to the reading of hi&s;tory, travels, poetry, and moral e&s;&s;ays. The&s;e &s;tudies are accommodated, in a peculiar man|ner, to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety, in America, and when a reli&s;h is excited for them, in early life, they &s;ubdue that pa&s;&s;ion for reading novels, which &s;o ge|nerally prevail among the fair &s;ex.</P>
<P N="7">7. There have been many controver&s;ies upon the &s;ubject of public and private education. The princi|pal objection to the former has always been derived from its mi&s;chievous influence upon the morals and manners of young people. The folly and vice of eve|ry &s;cholar, it has been &s;aid, are di&s;&s;eminated; &s;o that in a little while, each &s;cholar po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the follies and vices of the whole. But is there no remedy for the&s;e evils? yes there is&mdash;the <HI>principles and precepts of chri&s;|tianity</HI> are a &s;overeign antidote to them. Let, there|fore, all the branches of education, which have been mentioned, be connected with regular in&s;truction in the chri&s;tian religion.</P>
<P N="8">8. For this purpo&s;e the principles of the different &s;ects of Chri&s;tians &s;hould be taught and explained, and our pupils &s;hould early be furni&s;hed with &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;imple arguments in favour of the truth of Chri&s;|tianity. A portion of the Bible (of late improperly bani&s;hed from our &s;chools) &s;hould be read by them ev|ery day, and &s;uch que&s;tions &s;hould be a&s;ked, after read|ing it, as are calculated to imprint upon their minds the intere&s;ting &s;tories contained in it.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="72" REF="037446_0073_100D0D2209262DA8">9. <HI>Ro&s;&s;eau</HI> has a&s;&s;erted, that he great &s;ecret of edu|cation con&s;i&s;ts in "wa&s;ting the time of children pro|perly." There is &s;ome truth in this ob&s;ervation. I believe that we often impair their health, and weaken their capacities, by impo&s;ing &s;tudies upon them, which are not proportioned to their years. But this objec|tion does not apply <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> religious in&s;truction. There are certain &s;imple propo&s;itions in the Chri&s;tian reli|gion, that are &s;uited in a peculiar manner, to the in|fant &s;tate of rea&s;on and moral &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P N="10">10. A clergyman of long experience i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the in&s;truc|tion of youth,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Rev. Dr. Nicholas Collin, mini&s;ter of the Swe|di&s;h church in Wincocoe.</NOTE> informed me, that he always found children acquired religious knowledge more ea&s;ily than knowledge upon other &s;ubjects; and that young girls acquired this kind of knowledge more readily than boys. The female brea&s;t is the natural &s;oil of Chri&s;|tianity; and while our women are taught to believe its doctrines, and obey its precepts, the wit of Vol|taire, and the &s;tyle of Bolingbroke, will never be able to de&s;troy its influence upon our citizens.</P>
<P N="11">11. I cannot help remarking in this place, that Chri&s;tianity exerts the mo&s;t friendly influence upon &s;cience, as well as upon the morals and manners of mankind. Whether this be occa&s;ioned by the unity of truth, and the mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance which truths upon different &s;ubjects afford each other, or whether the fa|culties of the mind be &s;harpened and corrected by em|bracing the truths of revelation, and thereby prepared to inve&s;tigate and perceive truths upon other &s;ubjects, I will not determine, but it is certain that the great|e&s;t di&s;coveries in &s;cience have been made by Chri&s;tian philo&s;ophers, and that there is the mo&s;t knowledge in tho&s;e countries where there is the mo&s;t Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P N="12"><PB N="73" REF="037446_0074_100D0D5C09F1D278">12. By knowledge I mean truth only; and by truth I mean the perception of things as they appear to the divine mind. If this remark be well founded, then tho&s;e philo&s;ophers who reject chri&s;tianity, and tho&s;e chri&s;tians, whether parents or &s;chool-ma&s;ters, who neglect the religious in&s;truction of their children and pupils, <HI>reject</HI> and <HI>neglect</HI> the mo&s;t effectual means of promoting knowledge in our country.</P>
<P N="13">13. If the mea&s;ures that have been recommended for in&s;piring our pupils with a &s;en&s;e of religious and moral obligations be adopted, the government of them will be ea&s;y and agreeable. I &s;hall only remark un|der this head, that <HI>&s;trictne&s;s</HI> of di&s;cipline will always render <HI>&s;everity</HI> unnece&s;&s;ary, and that there will be the mo&s;t in&s;truction in that &s;chool where there is mo&s;t order.</P>
<P N="14">14. A philo&s;opher once &s;aid, "Let me make all the ballads of a country, and I care not who makes its laws."&mdash;He might with more propriety have &s;aid, let the ladies of a country be properly educated, and they will not only make and admini&s;ter its laws, but form its manners and character. It would require a lively imagination to de&s;cribe, or even to comprehend the happine&s;s of a country, where knowledge and vir|tue were generally diffu&s;ed among the female &s;ex.</P>
<P N="15">15. Our young men would then be re&s;trained from vice by the terror of being bani&s;hed from their com|pany. The loud laugh, and the malignant &s;mile, at the expence of innocence, or per&s;onal infirmities&mdash; the feats of &s;ucce&s;sful mimickry&mdash;and the low-priced wit, which is borrowed from a mi&s;application of &s;crip|ture phra&s;es, would no more be con&s;idered as recom|mendations to the &s;ociety of ladies. A double enten|dre, in their pre&s;ence, would then exclude a gentle|man forever from the company of both &s;exes, and
<PB N="74" REF="037446_0075_100D0D2431B357C8">
probably oblige him to &s;eek an a&s;ylum from contempt, in a foreign country.</P>
<P N="16">16. The influence of female education would be &s;till more exten&s;ive and u&s;eful in dome&s;tic life. The obligation of gentlemen to qualify them&s;elves by know|ledge and indu&s;try to di&s;charge the duties of benevo|lence, would be increa&s;ed by marriage; and the pat|riot, the hero, and the legi&s;lator, would find the &s;weet|e&s;t reward of their toils, in the approbation and ap|plau&s;e of their wives.&mdash;Children would di&s;cover the marks of maternal prudence and wi&s;dom in every &s;ta|tion of life; for it has been remarked that there have been few great or good men who have not been ble&s;&s;ed with wi&s;e and prudent mothers.</P>
<P N="17">17. <HI>Cyrus</HI> was taught to revere the gods, by his mother <HI>Mandane&mdash;Samuel</HI> was devoted to his prophetic office be|fore he was born, by his mother <HI>Hannah&mdash;Con&s;tantine</HI> was re&s;cued from pagani&s;m by his mother <HI>Con&s;tantia</HI>&mdash;&amp; <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;ixth inherited tho&s;e great and excellent qualities, which made him the delight of the age in which he lived, from his mother lady, <HI>Jane Seymour.</HI> Many other in&s;tances might be mentioned, if nece&s;&s;a|ry, from anci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nt and modern hi&s;tory, to e&s;tabli&s;h the truth of this propo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The Doctor concludes his excellent addre&s;s to the vi&s;itors, with the following intere&s;ting remarks to the young ladies of the &s;eminary.</P>
<P N="18">18. Young Ladies&mdash;An important problem is com|mitted for &s;olution; and that is, whether our pre&s;ent plan of education be a wi&s;e one, and whether it be calculated to prepare you for the duties of &s;ocial and dome&s;tic life. I know that the elevation of the female mind, by means of moral, phy&s;ical and religious truths, is con&s;idered by &s;ome men as unfriendly to the dome&s;|tic character of a woman. But this is the prejudice of little minds, and &s;prings from the &s;ame &s;pirit which
<PB N="75" REF="037446_0076_100D0D5D969DE2F0">
oppo&s;es the general diffu&s;ion of knowled<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e among the citizens of our republic. If men believe that igno|rance is favourable to the government of the female &s;ex, they are certainly deceived; for a weak and ig|norant woman will always be governed with the great|e&s;t difficulty. I have &s;ometimes been led to a&s;cribe the invention of ridiculous fa&s;hions in female dre&s;s, entirely to the gentlemen,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The very expen&s;ive prints of female dre&s;&s;es, which are publi&s;hed annually in France, are invented and executed wholly by <HI>GENTLEMEN.</HI></NOTE> in order to divert the ladies from improving their minds, and thereby to &s;ecure a more arbitrary and unlimitted authority over them.</P>
<P N="19">19. It will be in your power, Ladies, to correct the mi&s;take and practice of our &s;ex upon the&s;e &s;ub|jects, by demon&s;trating, that the female temper can only be governed by rea&s;on, and that the cultivation of rea&s;on, in women, is alike friendly to the order of nature, and to private as well as public happine&s;s.</P>

To accompli&s;h the&s;e, I &s;hall fir&s;t recommend it to my readers, whether in company or out, to avoid all particular or affected motions of the head, all wan|ton or oblique glances of the eyes, all ogling or wink|ing, dimpling of the cheeks, or primming of the lips: and in walking, remember to let your carriage be ea|&s;y, but not loo&s;e, regular, but not preci&s;e; and void of conceit in all your ge&s;tures: let your mien be free, and your air without the lea&s;t affectation.</P>
<P N="22">22. But the&s;e accompli&s;hments in carriage, I mu&s;t here ob&s;erve to my little &s;cholars, are only the beau|ties of your per&s;on, which, though extremely plea&s;ing to all outward appearance, will never render you per|fectly agreeable, unle&s;s accompanied with a &s;trict re|gard to mode&s;ty; which bani&s;hes every thing that is indecent or uncomely in your looks, words or actions; it tunes and refines every thing you &s;ay, moderates the tone, and never admits earne&s;t or loud di&s;cour&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I. FROM PORTIA TO HER DAUGHTER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Sophy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHILE you lived under my immediate care and in&s;pection, I endeavoured to &s;et before you a good example, and to in&s;til into your, tender mind &s;uch maxims of virtue and prudence, as were &s;uitable to your age and capacity. But now that you are &s;ettled in Mrs. Bromley's boarding-&s;chool, I can no longer follow this method of in&s;truction. However, what I cannot perform in per&s;on, I will endeavour to &s;upply by letters. For, though you are removed out of my &s;ight, you are not, for all that, bani&s;hed from my though<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s. On the contrary, you are more in them now than ever.</P>
<P N="2">2. I feel my concern for your happine&s;s rather in|crea&s;ed than dimini&s;hed by ab&s;ence; and I confe&s;s, that nothing in this world would give me &s;o much plea&s;ure, as to &s;ee you, one day, prove an accompli&s;h|ed woman To enable you to become &s;uch, no ad|vantages of education &s;hall be wanting Mrs. Brom|ley is a woman of &s;uch approved abilities and fidelity, that there is no danger of any neglect on her part; and the be&s;t advice and directions I can give, you &s;hall re|ceive in a &s;eries of letters, which I propo&s;e to write to you from time to time; and, I hope, I &s;hall have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing the good effect they have upon you, by your daily improvement in knowledge and virtue.</P>
<P N="3">3. Fir&s;t of all, then, my dear Sophy, let me advi&s;e you to obey Mrs. Bromley in every thing &s;he com|mands. She is a gentlewoman of &s;o much good &s;en&s;e, that &s;he will de&s;ire you to do nothing but what is rea|&s;onable; and, I know, &s;he will explain to you the

rea&s;onablene&s;s of all her injunctions, where you are able to comprehend it: and, where you are not, you mu&s;t take it for granted, that they are for your real intere&s;t and advantage. In a word, you mu&s;t behave to her with all the re&s;pect and obedience of a child; as, I am confident, &s;he will treat you with all the af|fection and tenderne&s;s of a parent. Your next care mu&s;t be to procure the love and e&s;teem of your &s;chool-fellows, by an inoffen&s;ive and obliging behaviour.&mdash; Hurt nobody; &s;peak ill of nobody; tell no lies of any body; but do to every one all the kind and civil of|fices you can. Lying, indeed, is a vice I never found you guilty of; and, I believe, I might have &s;pared my advice on that head.</P>
<P N="4">4. But there is another vice, again&s;t which I would caution you, I mean tale bearing? not that I ever perceived you more inclined to this vice than any oth|er, but becau&s;e you will now, perhaps, be under &s;trong|er temptations to the commi&s;&s;ion of it; and becau&s;e, of all others, it will render you mo&s;t odious to your companions. The nature and limitations of this vice I &s;hall explain to you more fully in &s;ome &s;ucceeding letter, when you will be more capable of under&s;tand|ing me. As many of your companions are much old|er than you, and farther advanced in their learning, take care to pay them that re&s;pect and deference which is due to their &s;uperior age and knowledge; e&s;pecial|ly, if, at any time, they are employed by the gover|ne&s;s or teachers to direct you in your ta&s;ks.</P>
<P N="5">5. I have got a thou&s;and things be&s;ides to &s;ay to you, but the&s;e mu&s;t be the &s;ubjects of &s;ome future letters. Let me advi&s;e you, however, before I conclude, to be punctual in &s;aying your prayers every morning and evening. You know I gave you peremptory in&s;truc|tions on this head at parting, and, I hope, you will not forget them. I expect to hear a good account of

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Sophy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P N="1">1. I HAD lately the plea&s;ure of hearing from Mrs. Bromley that you make great progre&s;s in learn|ing your Engli&s;h, and that &s;he expects you will &s;oon be one of the be&s;t readers in the &s;chool. To be able to read with propriety is certainly a very genteel ac|compli&s;hment, and not &s;o ea&s;y to be acquired as mo&s;t people imagine; and, perhaps, you will not find one woman in five hundred that is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it. There are &s;o many faulty ways of reading, which young people, are apt to run into, that it is difficult to avoid them all; and when once a bad habit is contracted, it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to correct it.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is your aunt Filmer, who reads with &s;uch a canting tone as grates the ears of the whole com|pany. She has frequently almo&s;t &s;ung me to &s;leep, though reading one of the mo&s;t diverting books in the world. Your cou&s;in Pulteney, you know, reads with &s;uch hurry and rapidity, and &s;uch neglect of the proper &s;tops and pau&s;es, that the mo&s;t attentive hearer cannot under&s;tand one &s;entence &s;he pronounces; whil&s;t Mrs. Da&s;hwood reads in &s;uch a &s;low and &s;lovenly manner, and draws out the words to &s;uch an immo|derate length, that nobody has patience to follow her. Mrs. Nugent reads with &s;uch a loud &s;hrill voice as &s;tuns the ears of the whole audience. It might do ve|ry well in a public a&s;&s;embly, but is altogether unfit for a tea-tale; whereas Mi&s;s Littleton's accent is &s;o
<PB N="96" REF="037446_0097_100D0D3F33B48E98">
faint and feeble, that you mu&s;t apply your ear almo&s;t to her mouth, before you can under&s;tand the &s;ubject.</P>
<P N="3">3. I would therefore, have you form your&s;elf upon the example of your governe&s;s, who indeed, is one of the be&s;t readers I ever heard. She reads with the &s;ame ea&s;y natural voice as &s;he u&s;es in conver&s;ation. She ob&s;erves the &s;tops and pau&s;es with great exactne&s;s. She reads &s;o &s;low as to be ea&s;ily under&s;tood by any per|&s;on, who will give a proper attention, and is not ab|&s;olutely dull; and yet &s;o fa&s;t, as not to di&s;gu&s;t tho&s;e of the quicke&s;t apprehen&s;ion. Her voice &s;he carefully adapts to the number and extent of her audience.</P>
<P N="4">4. When &s;he reads to a large company, her voice is high without being &s;hrill; when to a &s;mall one it is low, but withal di&s;tinct. In a word, &s;he is a com|plete mi&s;tre&s;s of the art of reading; and you cannot fail to become &s;o too, if you imitate her manner, and follow her directions. There are, be&s;ides, &s;ome niceties in reading; which I am afraid are above your comprehen&s;ion at pre&s;ent; but when you are farther advanced in your learning, I will explain them to you in &s;ome future letter. Your papa, your brothers, and &s;i&s;ters join me in offering our love to you.</P>

<P>I HAVE all your letters lying by me: I read them carefully every morning. I am obliged to you for the good advice you give me; and I will endeavour to follow it.

I am afraid you will think it &s;till very indifferent; but I have written as well as I could, and, I hope I &s;hall improve daily. I have followed your directions in &s;pelling; for I have &s;carce written one word without looking for it in the dictionary which you &s;ent me, and for which I am obliged to you: but if I have made any mi&s;takes, you will be &s;o good as to let me know in your next letter.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Mamma,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P N="1">1. IT is now more than a month, I think, &s;ince I received your la&s;t letter. I am glad that Mrs. Bromley gives you &s;o favourable an account of the pro|gre&s;s I make in mu&s;ic: perhaps it is more than I de|&s;erve. I can only &s;ay, that I &s;hall do all that lies in my power to learn this and every other thing you de|&s;ire me. I am greatly obliged to you for the good ad|vice and directions you have given me in your &s;everal letters; it &s;hall always be my con&s;tant endeavour to ob&s;erve them. As you are plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that no|thing

gives you greater plea&s;ure than to hear of my improvement: &s;o, you may be a&s;&s;ured, nothing gives me &s;o great plea&s;ure as to receive your approbation.</P>
<P N="2">2. For, though I am &s;en&s;ible of the u&s;efulne&s;s and importance of all the different accompli&s;hments, which you recommend to me; yet if I know my own heart, I think it is rather from a pro&s;pect of making you happy, than from any regard to my own intere&s;t, that I apply to my learning with &s;o much plea&s;ure and dil|ligence. How happy am I in having a mother, who places her chief delight in the welfare of her children! God grant I may never render my&s;elf unworthy of &s;o good a parent! I hope I never &s;hall.</P>
<P N="3">3. I have been learning French for a con&s;iderable time pa&s;t, and my ma&s;ter &s;eems to be very well &s;atis|fied with my progre&s;s.

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Sophy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P N="1">1. I HAD, lately, the plea&s;ure of hearing from Mrs. Bromley, that you are daily improving in all the different branches of your education, and particularly
<PB N="99" REF="037446_0100_100D0D78D447B620">
in geography, which, &s;he &s;ays, you have been learn|ing for &s;ome months pa&s;t. This is an accompli&s;h|ment equally u&s;eful and genteel; but in which, I am &s;orry to &s;ay it, mo&s;t of our &s;ex are &s;hamefully defici|ent; as I could prove by a variety of examples. Your aunt Delaval has frequently a&s;ked me whether Con|&s;tantinople lay in A&s;ia or Africa, and a thou&s;and other que&s;tions no le&s;s ridiculous. Mi&s;s Fenton, who&s;e wit is greater than her knowledge, and her vanity greater than both, is perpetually committing blunders of this kind.</P>
<P N="2">2. Mr. Grenville happened, the other day, to be reading the news-papers to a large company, and, among other articles one from War&s;aw, giving an ac|count of a certain nobleman, who, for &s;ome &s;light cau&s;e, had divorced his lady. He had no &s;ooner fini&s;h|ed, than Mi&s;s, with her u&s;ual forwardne&s;s, ob&s;erved that the&s;e Spaniards were the wor&s;t hu&s;bands in the world. Some of the company &s;miled, others blu&s;hed, and the re&s;t remained demurely grave. Mi&s;s, pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i|ving her error, was confounded and aba&s;hed. B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e gentleman, out of his great humanity, endeavoured to apologize for her, as well as he could, by adding, that the young lady's remark was very ju&s;t; that, tho the place mentioned in the news-papers was the chief city of Poland, he believed there was a town of the &s;ame name &s;omewhere in Spain, and it was a very ea&s;y matter to mi&s;take the one for the other.</P>
<P N="3">3. Into &s;uch &s;hameful blunders do young ladies fre|quently fall, from their ignorance of geography; and to &s;uch pitiful &s;hifts mu&s;t their friends have recour&s;e to &s;ave them the blu&s;h of confe&s;&s;ing their ignorance. But the knowledge of geography will effectually pre|vent your committing any blunders of this kind, as it will teach you the names of all the principal towns in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orld. Nor is this all; it will further acquaint
<PB N="100" REF="037446_0101_100D0D42E5CD5E40">
you with the climate, the &s;oil, and produce of all the different parts of the earth; and with the cu&s;toms, manners, government, and religion of the &s;everal in|habitants; by which means you will be enabled to talk pertinently on mo&s;t &s;ubjects that occur in conver&s;ation.</P>
<P N="4">4. But there is &s;till a higher part of geography, which, however, I dont think to be above the capa|city of a young lady; I mean that which treats of the figure of the ear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h; of its turning round its own axis once in twenty-four hours, which occa&s;ions the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of day and night; and round the &s;un once a year, which cau&s;es the regular changes of the &s;ea&s;ons: be&s;ides a variety of other truths, equally curious and entertaining, which will greatly open and enlarge your mind, and free it from a thou&s;and prejudices, that cloud the minds of the ignorant.</P>
<P N="5">5. What an infinite plea&s;ure it is for a lady to &s;it in her own room, and, by the u&s;e of the globe or maps, to examine all the various parts of the earth, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> travel, as it were, in the &s;pace of a few hours, ove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e whole world! In a word, the advantages a|ri&s;ing from the knowledge of geography are many, and almo&s;t innumerable. Nor is it valuable merely on its own account: it has likewi&s;e a clo&s;e connection with, and a great influence on other &s;tudies; particu|larly that of hi&s;tory, which it is impo&s;&s;ible thorough|ly to under&s;tand without it, as I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew you in &s;ome future letter.

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Sophy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P N="1">1. SOME weeks ago, I received a letter from Mrs. Bromley, in which &s;he commends you for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="101" REF="037446_0102_100D0D7ABB0348D8">
&s;weetne&s;s of your temper, and your great improve|ment in the needle. To &s;ay that I was glad on this occa&s;ion, is flat and unmeaning: I was over-joyed: I felt an emotion of plea&s;ure, known only to tho&s;e who have a daughter whom they love with the &s;ame warmth of affection. Go on, my dear Sophy, thus to increa&s;e the happine&s;s of your mother, by con&s;ult|ing your own intere&s;t; and, indeed, you cannot con|&s;ult it more effectually, than by making your&s;elf a complete mi&s;tre&s;s of the needle.</P>
<P N="2">2. For though there are many other female accom|pli&s;hments more &s;howy and &s;pecious, yet there is not any one more u&s;eful; nay, I may venture to &s;ay, there is none equally &s;o. What an infinite number of the female &s;ex, and, perhaps, the mo&s;t virtuous part of it too, live by the needle! How greatly does it con|tribute to render our per&s;ons more decent, more agree|able, and more beautiful! What a &s;urpri&s;ing differ|ence is there between the appearance of Lady Morton whom you have often &s;een at church, &amp; Dol Comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the cinderwench. And yet this difference is chiefly owing to dre&s;s; and dre&s;s depends chiefly on the needle. Be|&s;ides, as you advance, you will have &s;uch patterns &s;et you for &s;ewing, as will, at once, entertain and im|prove your fancy, and enable you the better to learn the art of drawing, which is one of the highe&s;t parts of your education.</P>
<P N="3">3. After all, my dear, I do not de&s;ire you to apply to your needle &s;o as to hurt your eyes, or weaken your con&s;titution: far from it. On the contrary, I would have this, and all your other &s;tudies, carried on in a perfect con&s;i&s;tency with your health, which is never to be &s;acrificed to any con&s;ideration whatever. All I mean is, that you &s;hould not neglect this qualification as u&s;ele&s;s, nor de&s;pi&s;e it as mean, or beneath a gentle|woman. U&s;ele&s;s it cannot be, for there is no &s;tation

of life in which a woman can be placed, where it is not highly &s;erviceable, and, for the mo&s;t part, ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary. And it is &s;o far from being mean and unworthy the character of a gentlewoman, that I will venture to &s;ay, there never was an accompli&s;hed woman without a competent &s;kill in this art.

<P N="1">1. I HAVE received &s;everal letters from you of late; and indeed nothing gives me &s;o much plea&s;ure; as they contain an account of your own welfare, and that of the re&s;t of the family, with the mo&s;t tender ex|pre&s;&s;ions of love, and the be&s;t directions for pur&s;uing my &s;tudies. How &s;hall I ever repay the obligations you are daily laying upon me! I never can; nor do you expect it.

<HEAD>LETTER VIII. FROM PORTIA TO HER DAUGHTER SOPHIA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Sophy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P N="1">1. YOUR la&s;t letter, which I received &s;ome weeks ago, gave me the greate&s;t plea&s;ure. You are as much improved in your writing as I could have wi&s;hed; and more indeed than I could have expected. Your expre&s;&s;ions of duty and obedience are extremely agreeable: they, at once, di&s;cover a good heart and a clear head. Do not make your&s;elf unea&s;y, my dear, becau&s;e you can never repay the favours I have done you. I am repaid already. I enjoy as much plea&s;ure in be&s;towing, as you can po&s;&s;ibly do in receiving them; and, if I &s;hould have the additional happine&s;s to &s;ee you become a polite and virtuous woman, I &s;hall be doubly rewarded.</P>
<P N="2">2. To receive favours from a &s;tranger, indeed, which we can never return, is always di&s;agreeable, and &s;ometimes dangerous. But, with parent and child, the ca&s;e is very different. The connexion between them is &s;o clo&s;e by nature, that all the good offices in the world can hardly make it clo&s;er. I am glad to hear that you live &s;o happily. It is no more than I had rea&s;on to expect, from the &s;weetne&s;s of your own di&s;po&s;ition, and the prudence of your governe&s;s; and I &s;hould be &s;orry if you con&s;idered her orders, with
<PB N="104" REF="037446_0105_100D0D47635FAA00">
regard to cleanline&s;s, as any diminution of your hap|pine&s;s; for &s;he is certainly in the right.</P>
<P N="3">3. Cleanline&s;s, my dear, is a habit, I had almo&s;t &s;aid a virtue, which you cannot learn too &s;oon, nor retain too long, both from a regard to your&s;elf, and to the world around you. It will, at once, contribute to the ea&s;e and health of your body, and be the means of introducing you into polite and genteel company; at lea&s;t, the oppo&s;ite extreme of dirtine&s;s will certain|ly deprive you of that advantage; it will either make your company to be &s;hunned; or, if that cannot be done, it will always render your pre&s;ence di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P N="4">4. But beware, my dear, that you do not confound cleanline&s;s with finery; nor mi&s;take the one for the other. They are as di&s;tinct in their nature as any two things can well be; and, though not incon&s;i&s;tent, are frequently found to be &s;eparated. A woman may be very neat and clean, in a plain and &s;imple dre&s;s; and &s;he may be very dirty and tawdry, in a fine and co&s;tly one. There is Mi&s;s Mole&s;worth: She never wears any thing above a plain &s;ilk gown; but that, and all the other parts of her dre&s;s, which are equally &s;imple, &s;he puts on and adju&s;ts with &s;uch elegance and propri|ety, as plea&s;es the eye of every one that beholds her: whil&s;t Lady Dormer, on the contrary, though dre&s;t in the riche&s;t &s;atin brocade, and loaded with a profu&s;ion of jewels and pearls, is, after all, &s;o &s;lovenly and taw|dry, that &s;he may rather be &s;aid to <HI>carry</HI> her clothes like a porter, than to <HI>wear</HI> them like a well-dre&s;t lady.</P>
<P N="5">5. I therefore expect you will obey your governe&s;s's orders in this, and in every thing el&s;e, becau&s;e I am confident &s;he will never order you to do any thing but what is ju&s;t and rea&s;onable, But you &s;ay, it con&s;umes a great deal of time: I am per&s;uaded you will always find as much as you ought to be&s;tow (in order to be near) between the time that is u&s;ual for leaving off
<PB N="105" REF="037446_0106_100D0D7FB18B8090">
&s;chool, and that of going to dinner. Be&s;ides, it will, every day, require le&s;s, for the more you practi&s;e it, the ea&s;ier it will become; and a twelve month hence, I dare &s;ay, you will be able to dre&s;s your&s;elf as well in half an hour, as you can do, at pre&s;ent, in a whole one. You may likewi&s;e con&s;ider it as a kind of di|ver&s;ion or relaxation from more &s;erious bu&s;ine&s;s; and diver&s;ions, you know, of one &s;ort or other, you mu&s;t have.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Mamma,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P N="1">1. I RECEIVED your very kind letter, and am greatly obliged to you for your good advice, which I &s;hall ever con&s;ider in the light of a command. I think my&s;elf bound in duty to obey all your orders; whether I under&s;tand the rea&s;onablene&s;s of them or not; tho ever &s;ince I was capable to di&s;tingui&s;h right from wrong, you have always had the good-nature and conde&s;cen&s;ion to convince me, that whatever you de&s;ired me to do was for my own intere&s;t and advantage.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is &s;till another particular, in which I mu&s;t beg your advice; as I am re&s;olved to do nothing with|out your permi&s;&s;ion. What I mean is the choice of my friends: for, though we are commonly all in the &s;ame room, yet I have no more than a general ac|quaintance with any one of my fellow boarders. I have not contracted a friend&s;hip and intimacy with any one of them. I might indeed have done it long ago. I have had frequent opportunities. I have been invited, and even importuned to it. But, &s;en&s;ible of my own incapacity to judge for my&s;elf, I have decli|ned

all their offers of friend&s;hip, and &s;till kept my&s;elf on general terms with them. Some &s;ay I am &s;pirit|le&s;s; &s;ome call me &s;hy; and others think I am proud&punc; But I am the le&s;s concerned what they either think or &s;ay, if you approve of my conduct.</P>
<P N="3">3. I do not choo&s;e to find fault with the behaviour of any of my companions. They are all as good, per|haps they are better than I am; and, I know, you would condemn any thing that had the lea&s;t appearance of detraction.

<HEAD>LETTER X. FROM PORTIA TO HER DAUGHTER SOPHIA.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Sophy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P N="1">1. HOW &s;hall I expre&s;s the joy I received from the peru&s;al of your la&s;t letter! how happy am I in having a daughter, who, at an age, when mo&s;t young ladies imagine they can think and act for them|&s;elves, is &s;o humble and dutiful, as to undertake no|thing without the permi&s;&s;ion and advice of her mother! But can't I conceal my joy within my own brea&s;t?&mdash; Or, if it mu&s;t have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent, can't I be &s;atisfied with im|parting it to others? Why tell it to my daughter? Why, my dear, I tell it to you for two rea&s;ons; both
<PB N="107" REF="037446_0108_100D0D81906FBBB0">
becau&s;e I like to think of you, and talk to you, and al&s;o becau&s;e I am per&s;uaded it will be an additional mo|tive to your per&s;evering in the &s;ame virtuous cour&s;e. For, I believe, you have &s;uch a tender regard for my happine&s;s, that, when once you know how greatly it depends on your good behaviour, you will never le&s;&s;en it by a contrary conduct.</P>
<P N="2">2. And now, after this flow of parental affection, I come to give you my be&s;t advice with regard to the choice of your friends. This, my dear, is one of the mo&s;t important &s;teps in life, and &s;hould be conducted with the greate&s;t prudence; otherwi&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ead of be|ing a &s;ource of happine&s;s and plea&s;ure, as it may and ought to be, it will prove the occa&s;ion of much pain and unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P N="3">3. The fir&s;t thing then, and indeed the principal thing, to be con&s;idered, in the choice of your friend, is, that &s;he be entirely free from all manner of vice, and from foibles too, as much as po&s;&s;ible; for if &s;he is not, you will be in danger of being corrupted by her bad example. We naturally, and, as it were, in|&s;en&s;ibly contract the manners of tho&s;e with whom we conver&s;e. In a vicious example, e&s;pecially, there is a kind of contagion, which rages like a plague, and in&s;ects all tho&s;e who are within the reach of its bale|ful influence. It undermines our virtue impercepti|bly. It &s;teals upon us unawares, and takes us by &s;ur|pri&s;e.</P>
<P N="4">4. There is an old proverb to this purpo&s;e, which is not the le&s;s true for being common, viz. "that birds of a feather flock together&punc;" by which I think is ge|nerally under&s;tood, that per&s;ons of the &s;ame &s;entiments and character are apt to a&s;&s;ociate with one another. But, I apprehend, it will likewi&s;e bear this con&s;truc|tion, which is not &s;o commonly attended to, that, let their tempers and di&s;po&s;itions be ever &s;o different when
<PB N="108" REF="037446_0109_100D0D4B34050828">
they meet, yet, by a long and intimate acquaintance, they will, in the end, become nearly alike.</P>
<P N="5">5 But, le&s;t you &s;hould not be able to apply gene|ral rules to particular ca&s;es, I &s;hall point out &s;ome of the vices and foibles, which you ought chiefly to guard again&s;t in the choice of a friend. Above all things, then, let her be free from fal&s;ehood and deceit, from hypocri&s;y and di&s;&s;imulation. Let her be open, hone&s;t and &s;incere, in all her actions. Sincerity is the foun|dation, it is the &s;oul of friend&s;hip; without this it cannot po&s;&s;ibly exi&s;t. For how can you cultivate a friend&s;hip with one who is always endeavoring to de|ceive you? Upon whom you cannot depend for the truth of any word &s;he &s;peaks, or the &s;incerity of any action &s;he performs? A friend&s;hip with &s;uch a per|&s;on, if indeed there could be any, would be alarmed and di&s;turbed by perpetual fears and &s;u&s;picions, which are utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with the nature of this &s;acred union.</P>
<P N="6">6. Flattery is another vice, nearly a-kin to the for|mer, and no le&s;s an enemy to friend&s;hip. It con&s;i&s;ts in prai&s;ing us for accompli&s;hments which we do not po&s;&s;e&s;s, and in concealing or extenuating the faults of which we are, unhappily, guilty. By the former we are puffed up with a ridiculous pride; by the latter we are lulled into a dangerous, and often fatal &s;ecuri|ty. It is the part of a true friend, on the contrary, to inform us of all our foibles and imperfections, and to give us all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance in her power to correct and amend them. For how el&s;e can we acquire a thorough knowledge of our&s;elves?</P>
<P N="7">7. The vice directly oppo&s;ed to flattery is calumny and detraction. It is, of all others, the mo&s;t odious in its nature, the mo&s;t pernicious in its effects, and the mo&s;t incon&s;i&s;tent with friend&s;hip. A friend! can that honourable name be be&s;towed upon one, who&s;e
<PB N="109" REF="037446_0110_100D0D83302DA228">
whole life is &s;pent in the low and dirty arts of &s;candal and defamation? who&s;e greate&s;t plea&s;ure it is to black|en and &s;ully the reputation of every per&s;on &s;he knows. To contract a friend&s;hip with one of this temper, would argue the height of folly. You might then ex|pect to have all your foibles and weakne&s;&s;es expo&s;ed to the view of the whole world, and your character loaded with a thou&s;and blemi&s;hes, from which, per|haps, it is entirely free: like the &s;illy clown in the fable, who finding a &s;nake in the fields, chill'd and benumb'd with cold, put it in his bo&s;om; but no &s;ooner was it recruited by the genial warmth of his body, than it &s;tung him to the quick, and made him pay dear for his ill-judged humanity.</P>
<P N="8">8. Your friend &s;hould likewi&s;e be free from pride, vanity, and &s;elf-conceit. For one that is immoderate|ly fond of her&s;elf, is not likely to be very fond of an|other; &s;he that has a high opinion of her own accom|pli&s;hments, will probably have but a very low opinion of yours. There is nobody, &s;he imagines, &s;o virtuous as to de&s;erve her affection, or &s;o &s;en&s;ible as to merit her e&s;teem; and without e&s;teem and affection there can be no friend&s;hip.</P>
<P N="9">9. Let her have nothing awkward, ridiculous, or affected in her manner. If &s;he has, be&s;ides the dan|ger of being infected by her example, you will fre|quently be put to the blu&s;h on her account. For one blu&s;hes for her friend almo&s;t as naturally as for her&s;elf.</P>
<P>And now, my dear, having thus mentioned &s;ome of the principal vices and foibles, from which your friend ought to be free, I &s;hould next proceed to con&s;ider tho&s;e virtues and good qualities, which &s;he ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s: but this &s;hall be the &s;ubject of another letter. In the mean time I conclude, by recommending you to the divine protection, and am,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XI.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Sophy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P N="1">1. AS I would not wi&s;h to leave you long undeter|mined in a matter of &s;o much con&s;equence as the choice of a friend, I have taken the fir&s;t opportu|nity, you &s;ee, of re&s;uming the &s;ubject; and &s;hall now endeavour to point out tho&s;e virtues and good qualities which you ought chiefly to regard in her character.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t of all, then, my dear, let her be one who is dutiful to her parents: for &s;he that is undutiful to her parents, will never be faithful to you. She that is deficient in this mo&s;t important of all duties, is not likely to be very ob&s;ervant of any other. And, in|deed, from a young lady's behaviour in this re&s;pect, you may form a pretty ju&s;t notion of her character in general; for one that is &s;o ungrateful, &s;o unnatural, as to have thrown off all re&s;pect and deference to her parents, may, and probably will, run into every other kind of vice and wickedne&s;s. Such a per&s;on, I hope, you will never make your friend. With &s;uch a one I would not even have you to keep company. If you do, you may be wor&s;e for it: it is impo&s;&s;ible you can ever be the better.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another e&s;&s;ential ingredient in the character of a true friend, is humanity and good nature; a certain &s;weetne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition and equality of mind, not to be ruffled by every trifling accident, nor &s;oured by any misfortune. A per&s;on, ble&s;&s;ed with this happy tem|per, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es within her&s;elf a perpetual fund of cheer|fulne&s;s and good humour, and diffu&s;es joy and gladne&s;s wherever &s;he comes. Plea&s;ed with her&s;elf, &s;he is the more apt to be plea&s;ed with tho&s;e around her. Slow to anger, &s;he is not provoked by &s;light offences; and ready to forgive, &s;he never harbours re&s;entment in her brea&s;t. As &s;he is happy in her own mind, &s;he delights to communicate happine&s;s to others; and, therefore,
<PB N="111" REF="037446_0112_100D0DBBDAE72178">
is willing to cultivate a friend&s;hip with any per&s;on, that &s;eems de&s;erving of her confidence. And, as &s;he is &s;teady and uniform in her conduct, &s;he never for|&s;akes her old friends, unle&s;s, by their folly or wick|edne&s;s, they have forfeited all claim to any further regard.</P>
<P N="3">3. In a word, without good-nature, there can be no &s;uch thing as friend&s;hip. The ill-natured, the peevi&s;h, and the pa&s;&s;ionate, are utterly unqualified for this virtuous intercour&s;e. A heart over-run with the&s;e vicious pa&s;&s;ions, is not &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;uch fine and delicate feelings. Friend&s;hip is a tender plant, and will not grow in &s;uch a coar&s;e and uncultivated &s;oil. A pa&s;&s;ionate per&s;on; in the violence of her anger, or rather madne&s;s, will &s;ay and do a thou&s;and things which are intirely incon&s;i&s;tent with all the laws of friend&s;hip; and the misfortune is, that every trifle is &s;ufficient to rou&s;e her pa&s;&s;ion. The breaking of a Chi|na di&s;h, the treading on a lap-dog, any thing will do&punc; the fuel is within her, and the lea&s;t &s;park will kindle the fire, and blow it up into a flame.</P>
<P N="4">4. Secre&s;y, my dear, is another quality, which your friend ought to po&s;&s;e&s;s. She that cannot keep a &s;ecret, can never be a true friend. For what is a friend? It is one to whom we can unbo&s;om our&s;elves without re&s;erve; to whom we can impart all our &s;e|cret thoughts, wi&s;hes and de&s;igns, without the lea&s;t fear of being betrayed, or having them expo&s;ed to the view of the world. Secrets are of two &s;orts; tho&s;e which we would not di&s;clo&s;e from the motives of &s;hame, and tho&s;e which we would not di&s;cover from the dictates of prudence. Of the former kind, I am per&s;uaded, you have none as yet; I hope you will never have any. Of the latter, I &s;uppo&s;e, you have &s;ome already, and the longer you live, you will have the more. But to betray either the one or the other
<PB N="112" REF="037446_0113_100D0D88DFF077C8">
is equally unworthy the character of a friend, and e|qually injurious to us; and &s;he that has acted &s;o ba&s;e|ly once, &s;hould never have it in her power to deceive us again.</P>
<P N="5">5. The next thing, my dear Sophy, to be con&s;ider|ed in the choice of a friend, is, that her &s;entiments and di&s;po&s;itions be nearly the &s;ame with your own&punc; otherwi&s;e you can never agree. If you are fond of bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;he of diver&s;ions if you love to &s;tay at home, and &s;he to be always gadding abroad; if you delight in plainne&s;s and &s;implicity, and &s;he in pomp and &s;plendour; if you are plea&s;ed with &s;en&s;ible and &s;erious conver&s;ation, and &s;he with nothing but fun and frolic; if you are fond of reading, and &s;he of ga|ming; if you are happy in peace and quietne&s;s, and &s;he only in crowds and company.&mdash;In a word, if you love what &s;he hates, and if &s;he likes what you abhor, there can be no concord and agreement, no &s;ympathy of temper, no harmony of &s;entiment, no mutual hap|pine&s;s; and without mutual happine&s;s, friend&s;hip can not exi&s;t</P>
<P N="6">6. After all, my dear, a perfect &s;imilarity of ta&s;te and &s;entiment is not to be expected (our minds being as different as our faces) nor, indeed, could it be ob|tained, do I think it ought to be de&s;ired. The faire&s;t characters are &s;tained with many &s;pots and blemi&s;hes. The mo&s;t virtuous per&s;ons have many foibles and im|perfections hanging about them, which they are not likely ever to correct, by conver&s;ing only with tho&s;e of their own ca&s;t and complexion. Should the grave conver&s;e only with the grave, would they not &s;ome|times be in danger of &s;inking into dullne&s;s? If the gay and &s;prightly keep company with none but tho&s;e of the &s;ame humour, will they not frequently be apt to &s;oar into&mdash;mad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s? By the &s;ame practice, the frugal would probably become avaricious, and the ge|nerous,
<PB N="113" REF="037446_0114_100D0DBE0C6BEE80">
prodigal and profu&s;e. It is therefore, my dear, an in&s;tance of the greate&s;t wi&s;dom, to cultivate a friend&s;hip and acquaintance with tho&s;e, who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch virtues and good qualities as are mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to our own weakne&s;&s;es and foibles. Are we &s;ubject to melancholy and low &s;pirits? let our friend be a per&s;on of cheerfulne&s;s and good humour. Are we, on the other hand, too much addicted to levity and mirth? let our friend be more &s;erious and &s;edate. Are we naturally hot and pa&s;&s;ionate? let us choo&s;e a friend of a cool and calm di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P N="7">7. Let me, therefore, be&s;eech you, my dear Sophy, by the regard you have for your own happine&s;s, and what, I believe, you value no le&s;s, by the regard you have for mine, to be very cautious and careful in the choice of your friend. As you have a great deal of &s;pirit and vivacity, let her be &s;omething more compo|&s;ed and &s;edate. As, I know, you are very generous and open hearted, let her be more frugal and prudent. In a word, let her po&s;&s;e&s;s, as much as po&s;&s;ible, all tho&s;e virtues and good qualities, which you are con|&s;cious that you your&s;elf mo&s;t want.

<P N="1">1. I HAVE all your letters on the &s;ubject of friend|&s;hip lying by me, and have read them &s;o fre|quently and &s;o carefully, that, I believe, I could al|mo&s;t repeat them by heart. I am greatly obliged to you for the good advice and directions you have given me, and will endeavour to conduct my&s;elf according|ly.
<PB N="114" REF="037446_0115_100D0D8A67034A18">
I never imagined that &s;o many qualifications were nece&s;&s;ary to form the character of a true friend; but, upon reflection, I am fully convinced it mu&s;t be &s;o, and that every thing you have &s;aid is founded in rea&s;on and good &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. There is one young lady here, and indeed but one, who &s;eems to an&s;wer the character you have drawn. She is, I think, free from all the vices and foibles, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the virtues and good qua|lities, which you have de&s;cribed. Be&s;ides, &s;he has always taken a particular plea&s;ure in my company and conver&s;ation, as, indeed, I have ever done in hers. We have a mutual regard and e&s;teem for each other, which it &s;hall not be my fault if I do not &s;oon improve into a &s;ettled and confirmed friend&s;hip. And, what is a very lucky circum&s;tance, &s;he is to leave the board|ing-&s;chool, and come to town much about the &s;ame time with me, which you &s;aid would be in a few months. This, however, I don't mention from any de&s;ire of changing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ituation &s;ooner than you think proper; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w you, that, by this means, I &s;hall have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in my power to continue and cultivate that friend&s;hip in town, which I can only begin here.</P>

<P N="1">1.

<P>I remember, when I was at the boarding-&s;chool. I

fondly imagined, that, by the time I was &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen years of age, my education would be entire|ly fini&s;hed, and I &s;hould have nothing to mind but plea&s;ure and diver&s;ion. But what a vain and fooli&s;h conceit has it been! I find, on the contrary, that the longer I live, I have the more to learn. I cannot &s;ay that I am di&s;appointed in this, as it gives me no pain nor unea&s;ine&s;s; I am rather plea&s;ed and delighted wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h it, as it &s;hews that, when we arrive at the years of di&s;cretion, we are capable of &s;o many rational ex|erci&s;es and employments, which we had not the lea&s;t notion of, whil&s;t we were young and inexperienced.</P>
<P N="2">2. Indeed, it &s;hould &s;eem from the conver&s;ation of my aunt, that my education is very far from being completely fini&s;hed: for &s;he &s;ays, that, be&s;ides re|viewing the &s;everal qualifications and accompli&s;hments I have already acquired, there are many new virtues which I have &s;till to learn. She is perpetually read|ing lectures to my cou&s;in and me on temperance, cha&s;|tity, mode&s;ty, humility, charity, benevolence, and I don't know how many other virtues, which, &s;he &s;ays are the glory and ornament of the female &s;ex. It is true, &s;he is plea&s;ed to compliment us by &s;aying, that we &s;eldom tran&s;gre&s;s again&s;t any of the&s;e virtues, but alleges, at the &s;ame time, that we do not &s;ufficiently under&s;tand their real nature and importance, nor how ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary it is to po&s;&s;e&s;s and practi&s;e them. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n order to make us happy in our&s;elves, and agreeable to the world.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIV. FROM PORTIA TO HER DAUGHTER SOPHIA</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Sophia,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P N="1">1. I RECEIVED and read your letter with great, plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction. As you advance i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> years, your &s;en&s;e of duty and obedience, in&s;tead of being dimini&s;hed, as is too frequently the ca&s;e with young people, &s;eems rather to be heightened and in|crea&s;ed. I am glad to &s;ee, that you are &s;en&s;ible <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the folly and vanity of your childi&s;h fancies and ima|ginations, when you was at the boarding-&s;chool. The &s;en&s;e of our own folly and ignorance is the be&s;t &s;ymp|tom of our wi&s;dom and knowledge, and the &s;ure&s;t pledge of our further progre&s;s and improvement; but a fond conceit, and high opinion of our own wi&s;dom and knowledge, is the mo&s;t effectual bar in the way of our ever acquiring either of the&s;e excellent quali|ties. For how &s;hould &s;he, who vainly thinks &s;he is wi&s;e and learned enough already, ever endeavour to become more &s;o? How &s;hould &s;he, who fondly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|agines &s;he wants nothing, put her&s;elf to the trouble and labour of procuring what &s;he does not want?&mdash; The truth is, a young lady, who fancies that &s;he i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> very wi&s;e and very learned, is likely to continue a fool and a dunce all her life.</P>
<P N="2">2. What was your expectation, however, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> you was at the boarding-&s;chool, is, I dare &s;ay, the expectation of ninety-nine in a hundred at that time of life; and 'tis well if they don't conduct them&s;elves accordingly, when they arrive at what are u&s;ually
<PB N="117" REF="037446_0118_100D0DC40E52FA18">
called, and what indeed ought to be, the years of di&s;|cretion. 'Tis very well if they don't imagine, that they have already learned all that can or need be learn|ed; that they are now women, and accompli&s;hed too, and therefore may devote their whole time and atten|tion to dre&s;s, vi&s;iting, and diver&s;ions. But this, I would fain think, is the fate of very few; and I am confident it will never be yours: you have already giv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n &s;ufficient proofs of your &s;uperior &s;en&s;e and pru|dence&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> have already made &s;ome progre&s;s in tho&s;e higher kinds of learning which are proper for a lady, and I hope you will continue to go on with the &s;ame &s;pirit and alacrity, with which you have begun.</P>
<P N="3">3. Your aunt's lectures, my dear (as you are plea|&s;ed to call them) on temperance, cha&s;tity, mode&s;ty, humility, charity, benevolence, and the like, are ex|tremely proper and nece&s;&s;ary. The&s;e are virtues, which it is the duty of every young lady di&s;tinctly to under&s;tand, and carefully to practi&s;e: they are, as your aunt ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, the glory and ornament of the female &s;ex: they add an inexpre&s;&s;ible grace and lu&s;tre to all our other qualifications and accompli&s;h|ments; and without them, wit, beauty, knowledge, and learning are not only u&s;ele&s;s and in&s;ignificant, but what is &s;till wor&s;e, pernicious and de&s;tructive.</P>
<P N="4">4. A beautiful per&s;on, with a vicious mind, is no better than a painted &s;epulchre, fair and comely with|out, but ugly and deformed within. A wit, without humanity and good-nature, is a pe&s;t and nui&s;ance; like a venomous wa&s;p, or poi&s;onous &s;erpent, &s;he &s;tings and bites every one &s;he meets, without di&s;tinction of friend or foe. And a per&s;on of knowledge and learn|ing, without humility and mode&s;ty, is generally a va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, conceited, and prattling pedant.</P>
<P N="5">5. On the other hand, a beautiful young lady, if &s;he in virtuous at the &s;ame time, becomes by that means,
<PB N="118" REF="037446_0119_100D0D8E742A5EC0">
at once more virtuous and more beautiful: more vir|tuous, becau&s;e her temptations to vice are more fre|quent and &s;trong; and every time &s;he re&s;i&s;ts the&s;e temptations, &s;he gives the mo&s;t convincing proof of her untainted cha&s;tity and un&s;potted honour: more beautiful; for what is beauty? It is not a &s;et of fea|tures formed with the nice&s;t &s;ymmetry and propor|tion; it is not a complexion compo&s;ed of the pure&s;t red and white: no; but it is both the&s;e informed, in|&s;pired, lighted up, and animated by the emanations of a virtuous mind: it is cha&s;tity, mode&s;ty, good-nature, compa&s;&s;ion, benevolence, and all the other virtuous di&s;po&s;itions and tender affections &s;treaming forth from the eyes, tho&s;e windows of the &s;oul, and playing in every lineament of the face. Unle&s;s the&s;e virtuo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> prevail in the &s;oul, and are &s;trongly marked and ex|pre&s;&s;ed in the countenance, the fine&s;t features and complexion are little better than the face of a painted baby, or lifele&s;s &s;tatue: all is dull, dead, and inani|mated; or, what is &s;till wor&s;e, gloomy, &s;our, and &s;ullen.</P>
<P N="6">6. Hence the graceful blu&s;h of mode&s;ty, and the plea&s;ing &s;mile of good-nature, &s;o frequently and &s;o awkwardly affected by tho&s;e who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of nei|ther of the&s;e virtues, but perhaps are remarkable for the oppo&s;ite vices: no matter, they are paying a com|pliment to virtue; they confe&s;s, by their hypocr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;y and di&s;&s;imulation, that the appearance of it is amiable and lovely; and if the appearance of it be lovely, how much more mu&s;t the reality be &s;o? The truth is, virtue is the only thing that is good and amiable:&mdash; &s;en&s;e, wit, knowledge, and learning, are in their own nature, indifferent; they are either good or bad, ju&s;t as they are well or ill employed. In the hands of a virtuous per&s;on, they may be the means of much good, in the hands of a vicious per&s;on, they may be the
<PB N="119" REF="037446_0120_100D0DC5966AE058">
means of much ill: but, virtue, in its own nature and con&s;equences, is certainly and infallibly productive of happine&s;s, as well to the per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it in par|ticular, as to the world in general.</P>
<P N="7">7. Hence too, my dear, you will ea&s;ily perceive what, I believe, you never dreamed of before, that no young lady can be beautiful without virtue. This opinion; I dar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ay, will m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e you &s;tare.&mdash;What! are there not &s;everal ladies in London, who have for|feited all title to virtue and honour, and notwith&s;tand|ing are reckoned among the greate&s;t beauties of the age? are courted, care&s;&s;ed, and almo&s;t adored, by crowds of young gentlemen. But &s;oftly, my dear, and don't be in &s;uch a hurry; allow me only to a&s;k you a &s;ingle que&s;tion: what is the character of the&s;e &s;ame young gentlemen? are they men of &s;en&s;e, judg|ment, ta&s;te, learning, knowledge, and virtue? or, are they not rather the vain, the ignorant, the &s;illy, and fooli&s;h, a parcel of empty coxcombs, and abandoned debauchees?</P>
<P N="8">8. Why, as for that, you'll &s;ay, you can't an&s;wer. But if you cannot an&s;wer for that, my dear, how can you be &s;ure, whether the&s;e ladies are beautiful or not? For if the young gentlemen, that admire and adore them &s;o much, are not proper judges of beauty, all their prai&s;es and compliments go for nothing; they are but mere empty &s;ound, without &s;en&s;e or meaning.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e, my dear, a deaf per&s;on were to tell you, that Mi&s;s Manley had a charming voice: or a blind one, that Lady A&s;ton had a fine complexion; would you believe them, pray? No, you'll reply; becau&s;e the one having lo&s;t the &s;en&s;e of hearing, can be no judge of &s;ounds; and the other, having lo&s;t the &s;en&s;e of &s;eeing, can be no judge of colours: and &s;o far you are right.</P>
<P N="9">9. Now, what if I &s;hould undertake to prove that
<PB N="120" REF="037446_0121_100D0D91DEC24098">
the&s;e young gentlem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n are almo&s;t as improper judges of beauty, as the deaf per&s;on is of &s;ounds, or the blind one of colours? that they have either lo&s;t entirely, or at lea&s;t greatly corrupted and depraved, tho&s;e fine and delicate feelings, which alone can di&s;tingui&s;h true and genuine beauty, from that which is fal&s;e and &s;purious. I don't pretend, my dear, to be a philo&s;opher, and tho I were, I know it would be extremely improper to entertain you with ab&s;tru&s;e and refined &s;peculations: which, perhaps, you could not under&s;tand, or, if you did, could be of no real u&s;e to you in the conduct of life. But this, I imagine, is a thing, which is obvi|ous to common &s;en&s;e: and, be&s;ides, it may be of &s;er|vice to you, as it will teach you what opinion to form of the&s;e empty fellows, and to pay no greater defer|ence to their judgment than it de&s;erves.</P>
<P N="10">10. Allow me, therefore, to a&s;k you a few que&s;|tions, and you'll find that your own an&s;wers will prove the point in di&s;pute. Fir&s;t of all then, my dear, do you think it po&s;&s;ible for a per&s;on, who has lo&s;t all &s;en&s;e of cha&s;tity and mode&s;ty him&s;elf, to be a proper judge of the expre&s;&s;ions of the&s;e virtues in others? 'Tis ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible!</P>
<P N="11">11. For it may be affirmed in general, that every deviation from the paths of virtue, every indulgence in criminal plea&s;ure, has a natural tendency to vitiate the ta&s;te, to corrupt the heart, and to &s;tifle and extin|gui&s;h all the finer feelings and affections of the mind. A per&s;on immer&s;ed in &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure, grows le&s;s and le&s;s rational every day: he degenerates by quick de|grees, till at la&s;t he &s;inks down into a mere animal&punc; and lo&s;es all reli&s;h for every thing that is virtuous, noble, and manly.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XV.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Sophy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P N="1">1. MY time for &s;ome months pa&s;t has been &s;o en|tirely engro&s;&s;ed with company and bu&s;ine&s;s, that I have been obliged, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to inter|rupt my epi&s;tolary corre&s;pondence. But now being &s;omewhat more at lei&s;ure, I &s;hall re&s;ume the &s;ubject of your education.</P>
<P>In my two la&s;t letter, you know, I endeavoured to explain to you, as well as I could, the nature of temperance, and to convince you of the great utility and importance of that virtue. In this I &s;hall give you my &s;entiments of another virtue, which is, no le&s;s, or rather, which is infinitely more nece&s;&s;ary; nay, I will venture to &s;ay, which is the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary and indi&s;pen&s;ible of all others, and without which, wit, beauty, &s;en&s;e, knowledge, and every other female ac|compli&s;hment, are not only u&s;ele&s;s, but even perni|cious and de&s;tructive.</P>
<P N="2">2. You will ea&s;ily gue&s;s, my dear, that the virtue I mean is cha&s;tity, the greate&s;t glory and ornament of our &s;ex, and what mo&s;t effectually recommends us to the love and e&s;teem of the other. Perhaps I may be accu&s;ed of indelicacy, in entertaining a lady, &s;o very young as you are, with a di&s;cour&s;e on &s;uch a tender &s;ubject; though, I think, the character I bear as your mother, and con&s;equently the concern I mu&s;t have for your happine&s;s, may well free me from any imputa|tion of that kind: for I do not &s;ee how any thing can be called indelicate, which a virtuous mother can write to a virtuous daughter. Be&s;ides, as it will be allowed to be extremely difficult, and, perhaps, even impo&s;&s;ible, to fix the preci&s;e time when a young lady &s;hould receive in&s;tructions on this head, every mother of con&s;equence is left, in a great mea&s;ure, to follow her own judgment; and, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, it is my o|pinion,
<PB N="122" REF="037446_0123_100D0D9382E15DA0">
that it is much better to be a whole year too early, than one day too late: the inconveniences of the former method, if indeed there be any, are very trifling and incon&s;iderable; but the bad effects of the latter are always dangerous, and frequently fatal and irreparable.</P>
<P N="3">3. Young as you are, my dear, you cannot be ig|norant of what I mean by the virtue of cha&s;tity: and therefore I &s;hall ob&s;erve the rules of delicacy &s;o far, as not to explain the nature of it more particularly. Al|low me only to mention a few things, which may &s;erve to convince you of its ine&s;timable value; and to give you a few plain directions, by the ob&s;ervance of which, you may ea&s;ily pre&s;erve it pure and untainted.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t a young lady is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this virtue, &s;he is ble&s;&s;ed with the approbation of her own con&s;cience, beloved and care&s;&s;ed by her friends and relations, e&s;|teemed and re&s;pected by all her acquaintance. But if, by &s;ome unlucky and fatal accident, &s;he is once de|prived of this precious jewel, that moment &s;he lo&s;es all inward peace and tranquility of mind; &s;he is for|&s;aken and abandoned by her neare&s;t friends and rela|tions; &s;he is de&s;pi&s;ed and contemned, hi&s;&s;ed and hoot|ed by all the world.</P>
<P N="4">4. Yow know, my dear, the once happy, but now wretched Mi&s;s Grey. She was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of wit, beau|ty, &s;en&s;e, knowledge, character, and fortune, in as high a degree, as mo&s;t young ladies in England; but &s;he was&mdash;my heart bleeds when I think on her mi|&s;erable fate&mdash;&s;he was decoyed, deceived, and at la&s;t abandoned by a perfidious and inhuman villain. Ba|ni&s;hed from her father's hou&s;e, de&s;erted by her friends, &s;hunned by her acquaintance, and thrown on the wide world! what could &s;he do? or whither could &s;he go? Poverty, &s;hame, infamy, and di&s;grace, in their mo&s;t hideous and ugly forms, &s;tared her in the face, and
<PB N="123" REF="037446_0124_100D0DCA49E74358">
drove the poor de&s;ponding and di&s;tracted creature into a cour&s;e of life, at the very thoughts of which &s;he would once have &s;huddered with horror. Her father &s;tript her of her fortune, the world deprived her of her character, her wit degenerated into ob&s;cenity, her beauty was changed into deformity, and her &s;en&s;e and knowledge &s;erved only to render her more dexterous and expert in the ways of vice and wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P N="5">5. In this picture, my dear, which is as true as it is terrible, you &s;ee the dangerous and de&s;tructive con|&s;equences of lewdne&s;s and debauchery: tremble at the very thoughts of &s;uch an abominable vice; and learn, from the folly and mi&s;ery of others, to be wi&s;e, vir|tuous, and happy your&s;elf.</P>
<P>Do not imagine, my dear, that what I have now &s;aid is only my own private opinion: no; it is, and ever has been, the opinion of the wi&s;e and good, in all ages and nations of the world. In &s;ome particular countries e&s;pecially, this virtue of cha&s;tity has been held in &s;uch high repute and e&s;timation, that rather than lo&s;e it, or &s;urvive the lo&s;s of it, &s;ome have even cho&s;en to be deprived of life it&s;elf.</P>
<P N="6">6. It is reported of one Lucretia, a Roman-lady, that having been ravi&s;hed by Sextus, elde&s;t &s;on to Tarquin, the king of that country, &s;he took a dagger in her hand; and, after having publicly exhorted her relations to revenge her injury on the barbarous ravi&s;h|e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, &s;he plunged it in her bo&s;om, at once putting an end to her life and to her di&s;grace. And &s;uch was the opinion which the Romans entertained of the heinous nature of this crime, as well as of the fatal con&s;equen|ces which followed the commi&s;&s;ion of it, that the whole nation ro&s;e in arms, and not only dethroned the king, and bani&s;hed the royal family, but even, if I may &s;peak &s;o, bani&s;hed kings in general, making a decree, that, for the future, no king &s;hould ever &s;way

the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eptre over the Roman people, but that their go|vernment, in&s;tead of a monarchy, &s;hould thencefort<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> become a republic.</P>
<P N="7">7. I dare &s;ay, my dear, you have heard the common ob&s;ervation, that cha&s;tity is as nece&s;&s;ary and ornamen|tal in a woman, as courage is in a man: but, in fact, it is infinitely more &s;o. For though perhaps a coward may be as contemptible among the men, as a pro&s;ti|tute is among the women, &s;till there is this material difference between the two ca&s;es, that if a man lo&s;es his character for want of courage, in one in&s;tance, he may, by &s;ome extraordinary effort of valour, recover i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in another; but a woman's character once lo&s;t, can never be regained: like a fallen &s;tar, &s;he &s;ets to ri&s;e no more. Not floods of tears,&mdash;not whole years of &s;orrow and repentance,&mdash;not the mo&s;t con&s;tant prac|tice of all the other virtues of a good life,&mdash;not even the mo&s;t rigid ob&s;ervance of the rules of cha&s;tity for the future,&mdash;nothing will avails; they can never re|&s;tore her lo&s;t reputation, nor replace her in the rank of pure ve&s;tals.</P>
<P N="8">8. And this &s;ingle con&s;ideration, methinks, were i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> but deeply impre&s;&s;ed on the minds of young ladies, might of it&s;elf be &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve their cha&s;tity incorrupted, and to make them tremble and &s;hudder at the mo&s;t di&s;tant apprehen&s;ions of lo&s;ing a trea&s;ure, which is &s;o precious in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and &s;o irrecover|able when lo&s;t. But, as our be&s;t and firme&s;t re&s;olu|tions are frequently overpowered by the &s;trength and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">umber of temptations, I &s;hall point out &s;ome of the principal incentives to lewdne&s;s, which you ought carefully and con&s;tantly to avoid.</P>
<P N="9">9.

But temperance has a quite contrary effect: it keeps all the inferior appetites in due &s;ubordination to the di|rection and government of rea&s;on, and pre&s;erves the faculty of rea&s;on it&s;elf clear and &s;trong; clear, to perceive the mo&s;t di&s;tant approaches of danger<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">; and &s;trong, to repel the mo&s;t violent a&s;&s;aults.</P>

<P N="11">11. With regard to the other part of the advice there is no le&s;s danger.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Mamma,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P N="1">1. YOUR letters on temperance and cha&s;tity I re|ceived in due cour&s;e. My aunt, I believe, who carefully in&s;pects every part of my conduct, will do me the ju&s;tice to acknowledge, that I have always been pretty ob&s;ervant of both the&s;e virtues. The rules of temperance, I think, I have never tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed in any material in&s;tance; and, I am &s;ure, I never had the lea&s;t inclination, nor ever di&s;covered the lea&s;t propen|&s;ity to violate tho&s;e of cha&s;tity. But, I mu&s;t confe&s;s at the &s;ame time, that till the receipt of your letters, I never under&s;tood the nature of the&s;e virtues &s;o di|&s;tinctly, nor was &s;o fully convinced of their great va|lue and importance. Your la&s;t letter, e&s;pecially, has made &s;uch a deep impre&s;&s;ion upon my mind, that me|thinks I could now &s;acrifice every thing to the pre&s;er|vation of my cha&s;tity: rather than lo&s;e my honour, I would cheerfully lo&s;e my life.</P>
<P N="2">2. Poor Mi&s;s Grey, mamma, I remember extreme|ly well, and had formerly heard &s;ome indi&s;tinct ac|count of her misfortune; but never knew that her condition was &s;o deplorable and de&s;perate as you re|pre&s;ent it. The &s;hort but affecting hi&s;tory you wrote me of her mi&s;erable fate, pierced me to the very heart,
<PB N="128" REF="037446_0129_100D0D99B648CA20">
and made the tears gu&s;h into my eyes: I am &s;ure I &s;hall never forget it &s;o long as I live.</P>
<P>But, my dear mamma, what I have chiefly to beg of you at pre&s;ent, is, that you will be &s;o good as to write me your &s;entiments of the virtue of mode&s;ty, which I think you gave me &s;ome rea&s;on to expect by what you &s;aid in the clo&s;e of your la&s;t letter. I am the more anxious to have your opinion of this matter, as it is a &s;ubject on which my aunt has lately lectured my cou&s;in and me pretty &s;everely.</P>
<P N="3">3. She alleges, that we are very often faulty in this re&s;pect, but owns, at the &s;ame time, that our faults &s;eem chiefly to proceed from ignorance. This, how|ever, &s;he will not allow to be a &s;ufficient apology; for though ignorance, &s;he &s;ays, be le&s;s criminal than impudence, yet it is far from being excu&s;able in young ladies of our age and education. Be&s;ides, &s;he a&s;&s;ures us, the world will be more apt to impute &s;uch faults to want of mode&s;ty than to want of &s;en&s;e; for that, when the &s;ame action may proceed from different mo|tives, few people have the humanity and good nature to a&s;cribe it to the be&s;t. Plea&s;e to give my duty to my papa, and my kind love to my &s;i&s;ters and brothers. My aunt pre&s;ents her compliments to you and the re&s;t of the family.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Sophy,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P N="1">1. YOUR la&s;t letter, which I received a few weeks ago, gave me the greate&s;t &s;atisfaction. I was particularly plea&s;ed to hear you expre&s;s &s;uch a noble re&s;olution of pre&s;erving your cha&s;tity pure and untaint|ed. May God Almighty a&s;&s;i&s;t you in this, and in ev|ery

other virtuous undertaking. Agreeably to my own promi&s;e, and in compliance with your de&s;ire, I &s;hall now give you my &s;entiments of mode&s;ty, and &s;ome other female virtues. Mode&s;ty, my dear, is the outward expre&s;&s;ion of a pure and cha&s;te mind: and therefore, every w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> you &s;peak, every action you perform, every ge&s;ture of your body, every look of your eyes, every part of your dre&s;s; in fine, every thing, by which the inward di&s;po&s;itions of the mind can be expre&s;&s;ed and di&s;covered, comes under the re|gulation of this virtue.</P>
<P N="2">2. Mode&s;ty, as it relates to dre&s;s, has already been con&s;idered under that article: as it relates to conver|&s;ation, it has been, in &s;ome mea&s;ure explained, in treating of that and the &s;ubject of cha&s;tity. After the advice I then gave you, to &s;hun the lewd and immo|de&s;t conver&s;ation of others, it would certainly be un|nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e any other arguments to di&s;&s;uade you from running into the &s;ame error your&s;elf. There is &s;omething in this practice &s;o ba&s;e and vulgar, as well as &s;o, indecent and abominable, that I will not even &s;uppo&s;e you capable of a thing at once &s;o unpolite and immoral.</P>
<P N="3">3. But, my dear, mode&s;ty regards not only the mat|ter of your conver&s;ation, but al&s;o the manner of it; not only what you &s;ay, but likewi&s;e how you &s;ay it. And, indeed, this is &s;uch an e&s;&s;ential part of mode&s;ty, that it frequently appears more vi&s;ibly in the manner of expre&s;&s;ing a thing than in the nature of the thing it&s;elf. There is Lady Langley; &s;he returns thanks for a favour, and to people as good as her&s;elf too, with &s;uch a carele&s;s and indifferent, and &s;ometimes indeed with &s;uch a haughty and overbearing air, that a by|&s;tander, who only ob&s;erves her manner, would be apt to conclude, that &s;he was rather be&s;towing one upon &s;ome of her dependants, or giving orders to her foot|man:

<P N="4">4. Nothing, my dear, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> incon&s;i&s;tent with mode&s;ty, than to talk with a loud, &s;hrill, and har&s;h tone of voice. This is very unbecoming even in a man, but much more in a woman, and mo&s;t of all in a young woman, who&s;e accent &s;hould be low, &s;mooth and gentle, an emblem of the inward &s;oftne&s;s and de|licacy of her mind. It is no le&s;s incon&s;i&s;tent with the rules of mode&s;ty, to talk in a po&s;itive and peremptory &s;train. This is &s;carce tolerable, even when you are talking of things that cannot be contradicted; but i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ab&s;olutely intolerable, when you are &s;peaking of mat|ters that are of a doubtful nature, as indeed mo&s;t &s;ub|jects of conver&s;ation are. 'Tis the duty of a young lady to talk with an air of diffidence, as if &s;he propo|&s;ed what &s;he &s;aid, rather with a view to receive infor|mation her&s;elf, than to inform and in&s;truct the com|pany.</P>
<P N="5">5. Mode&s;ty, as it regards the countenance, and e&s;|pecially the expre&s;&s;ion of the eyes, is no le&s;s worthy of your attention, becau&s;e, perhaps, it appears more in this than in any one thing whatever. Young as you are, my dear, you cannot be ignorant, that all the different pa&s;&s;ions of the mind may be painted and expre&s;&s;ed in the countenance. Anger and meekne&s;s, joy and &s;orrow, love and hatred, pride and humility, impudence and mode&s;ty, have each a particular air of the face, naturally adapted to expre&s;s them; and what|ever pa&s;&s;ion happens to be uppermo&s;t in the mind, the countenance will take its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and complexion from thence. Thus joy is expre&s;&s;ed by a plea&s;ing &s;mile, &s;orrow by a dejected look, pride by a &s;uperci|lious
<PB N="131" REF="037446_0132_100D0DD1E335A818">
frown, humility by an una&s;&s;uming air, impu|dence by a wanton glance, mode&s;ty by a cha&s;tifed mien, and &s;o of the re&s;t. And though I am no great friend to phy&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gnomy, or the judging of people's characters by their looks, yet, I believe, there is &s;omething in it. Tho I know the face is &s;ometimes a fal&s;e gla&s;s, &s;till I am per&s;uaded it is as often, and much oftener, a true one; and that the countenance is frequently a faithful picture of the mind.</P>
<P N="6">6. In a word, my dear (for I mu&s;t repeat it to you again) the only way to have a mode&s;t look, a mode&s;t gait, or a mode&s;t behaviour in general, is to have a mode&s;t mind. Without this, all the formality, gra|vity, and grimace in the world, will &s;ignify nothing: for, though by this means you may be able to impo&s;e upon the thoughtle&s;s and ignorant, yet the &s;en&s;ible and judicious ob&s;erver will always &s;ee through the ma&s;k, and perhaps but de&s;pi&s;e you the more for your hypo|critical &s;olemnity. But, my dear, do not mi&s;take me, While I advi&s;e you to be mode&s;t, I do not advi&s;e you to be &s;heepi&s;h and ba&s;hful; far from it. Mode&s;ty and &s;heepi&s;hne&s;s, however alike they may be in appear|ance, are as different in their nature, as any two things can well be. A mode&s;t per&s;on will not talk too much or too high in company, becau&s;e &s;he knows it is im|proper: a &s;heepi&s;h per&s;on will hardly talk at all, or at lea&s;t not &s;o as to be under&s;tood, becau&s;e &s;he is afraid. A mode&s;t per&s;on looks with a decent a&s;&s;urance: a &s;heepi&s;h one is aba&s;hed, and blu&s;hes at &s;he don't know what. A mode&s;t per&s;on will never contradict the ge|neral ta&s;te of the company, unle&s;s it be incon&s;i&s;tent with decency and good manners: a &s;heepi&s;h per&s;on will hardly contradict it, even when it is. The one acts from principle, the other from mere in&s;tinct: the one is guided by the rules of right rea&s;on, and there|fore is con&s;i&s;tent in her conduct: the other is guide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="132" REF="037446_0133_100D0D9D9896E048">
by no rules at all, and con&s;equently has no uniformi|ty of character.</P>
<P N="7">7. This &s;heepi&s;hne&s;s naturally leads to, and com|monly ends in, a kind of fal&s;e mode&s;ty, which is &s;uch an extreme degree of complai&s;ance, &s;uch a yielding &s;o&s;tne&s;s of nature, as is not able to refu&s;e any thing. A per&s;on of this character has no choice of her own: &s;he re&s;igns her own judgment, and is content to be di|rected by the judgment, or rather by the humour and caprice, of other people. When any thing is propo|&s;ed, &s;he never examines whether it be rea&s;onable, but only whether it be fa&s;hionable; and if it is, &s;he is &s;atisfied: &s;he a&s;ks no more: &s;he will comply with it, let the con&s;equence be what it will. She is a&s;hamed to refu&s;e any thing that is fa&s;hionable, however vi|cious; or to do any thing that is unfa&s;hionable, how|ever virtuous. Should it ever become unfa&s;hionable to go to church, or to be obedient to parents, or even to ob&s;erve the rules of mode&s;ty, it is ten to one but &s;he would be a&s;hamed to perform any of the&s;e duties; &s;o that, from an exce&s;s of mode&s;ty, &s;he perhaps might be tempted to violate the laws of mode&s;ty it&s;elf.</P>
<P N="8">8. Let me, therefore, advi&s;e you, my dear Sophy, carefully to guard again&s;t fal&s;e mode&s;ty, which is one of the greate&s;t enemies of virtue, and perhaps has be|trayed young people into as many vices as the mo&s;t a|bandoned impudence. Never be &s;o extremely mode&s;t as to comply with any thing that is bad, how much &s;oever it may be in vogue; nor ever be a&s;hamed to follow what is good, however &s;ingular and uncommon. True mode&s;ty, my dear, is meant to be the pre&s;erver, not the betrayer of your virtue: it will be a kind of guard and protection to your cha&s;tity; it will &s;ecure you from the rudene&s;s and impertinence of the impu|dent and abandoned part of the other &s;ex. There is &s;uch a dignity and maje&s;ty in a mode&s;t behaviour, as
<PB N="133" REF="037446_0134_100D0DD5A138AB50">
never fails to command re&s;pect: it confounds and a|ba&s;hes even the mo&s;t profligate, and makes them either a&s;hamed or afraid of giving vent to their low and ob|&s;cene ribaldry, when they are &s;ure it will be received with a blu&s;h or a frown, with contempt or aver&s;ion.</P>
<P N="9">9. After all, my dear, I don't mean to recommend to you a &s;tiff, formal, and preci&s;e behaviour, no: this is not mode&s;ty; it is prudery, which is as far re|moved from mode&s;ty on the one hand, as coquetry is on the other. Mode&s;ty does not need any foreign glo&s;s to &s;et it off: it appears mo&s;t amiable in its own native colours. The prude affects an appearance of more mode&s;ty than &s;he really has: the coquette affects an appearance of le&s;s. The former will not probably gain credit: the latter certainly will: The prude will not be believed to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;o much mode&s;ty as &s;he pretends to, perhaps not even &s;o much as &s;he actually has: the coquette will readily be allowed to have no more than &s;he &s;eems, and po&s;&s;ibly even le&s;s. Since &s;he is &s;o very anxious to convince the world, that &s;he has little regard for mode&s;ty, the world, if &s;he plea&s;|es, will be &s;o complai&s;ant, as to believe that &s;he has none at all; whereas they will puni&s;h the pre&s;ump|tion of the prude, for putting on the appearance of more mode&s;ty than &s;he has, by even &s;u&s;pecting the reality of what &s;he actually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es.</P>
<P N="10">10. The prude is &s;o extremely nice and delicate, that &s;he is offended at every thing: the coquette is &s;o very ea&s;y and indifferent, that &s;he is offended at no|thing. The prude &s;tartles at the mo&s;t innocent ex|pre&s;&s;ions, as rude and indecent: the coquette hears what are really the mo&s;t rude and indecent, without any concern. The prude has frequently a grave and demure look, when her heart is light and cheerful: the coquette has frequently a gay and &s;prightly coun|tenance, when her heart is heavy and &s;orrowful. The
<PB N="134" REF="037446_0135_100D0D9FCBEDFC50">
prude is often &s;ilent when &s;he ought to &s;peak: the coquette often &s;peaks, when &s;he ought to be &s;ilent. The prude frequently &s;tays at home, when her heart is at the play or opera: the coquette frequently goes to the play or opera, when her heart is at home. In a word, the prude &s;tudies to be &s;ingular; the coquette to be fa&s;hionable: the former wants to pa&s;s for a la|dy of the mo&s;t rigid virtue; the latter for an agreeable companion. The prude de&s;pi&s;es the coquette as a giddy fool: the coquette laughs at the prude as a con|ceited hypocrite; and the lady of true mode&s;ty pities them both, as well meaning, perhaps, but mi&s;taken creatures. And objects of pity they certainly are;&mdash; for their error proceeds rather from the weakne&s;s of their heads, than the badne&s;s of their hearts.</P>
<P N="11">11. The one imagines, that a prude is the mo&s;t ri|diculous character in the world, and that therefore the farther &s;he is from it, &s;o much the better; the other thinks the character of a coquette &s;till more contempt|ible, and endeavours to &s;hun it with the &s;ame care. Hence the one naturally becomes a coquette, and the other a prude; not &s;o much from a love to the cha|racter they have a&s;&s;umed, as from a hatred to the cha|racter they have avoided. Thus, like all fools, while they fly from one vice, they run into its oppo&s;ite, ne|ver remembering, that in this, as in mo&s;t other ca&s;es, virtue lies in the <HI>golden mean;</HI> that mode&s;ty is the mid|dle point between coquetry and prudery, both of which are equally ridiculous and contemptible.</P>
<P N="12">12. But, my dear, though the prude and the co|quette be characters equally ridiculous, &s;till, it mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> be acknowledged, they are not equally dangerous.&mdash; The prude has at lea&s;t the appearance of mode&s;ty but the coquette has not even that: and though ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> may be an appearance of virtue, where there is no re|ality; yet 'tis hardly po&s;&s;ible there can be any reality
<PB N="135" REF="037446_0136_100D0DD728300278">
where there is no appearance, or (what is wor&s;e) where there is an appearance of vice: at lea&s;t the world will always judge &s;o, becau&s;e it is only by ap|pearances they can judge.</P>
<P>Hence it is, that a prude frequently pre&s;erves her reputation, after having lo&s;t her innocence; whil&s;t a coquette &s;ometimes pre&s;erves her innocence after &s;he has lo&s;t her reputation. Be&s;ides, the coquette is ex|po&s;ed to many temptations, from which the prude is, in a great mea&s;ure, free. The behaviour of the prude keeps the men at a proper di&s;tance; the behaviour of the coquette admits, and even invites them to impro|per familiarities&punc; and how very dangerous the&s;e fami|liarities are, is more ea&s;ily conceived than expre&s;&s;ed: indeed it is from this quarter that our greate&s;t danger ari&s;es, as perhaps I may take occa&s;ion to &s;hew you in &s;ome other letter.</P>
<P N="13">13. But, though the prude be expo&s;ed to fewer dan|gers than the coquette, &s;till &s;he is expo&s;ed to &s;ome, and to many more than &s;he would be, were &s;he but &s;imply and unaffectedly mode&s;t. For, as the world &s;ees that her mode&s;ty is partly counterfeit, they will be apt to conclude that it is entirely &s;o, and that it is a&s;&s;umed only to &s;ave appearances; and, upon this &s;up|po&s;ition, many attempts will be made on her virtue, which never would have been made, but for her pru|dery and affectation. And, from a general review of the hi&s;tory of our &s;ex, I imagine, it will appear, that the arts of de&s;igning and deceitful men have ruined as many prudes as coquettes; and that almo&s;t all tho&s;e who have been thus ruined, have been remarkable for one or other of the&s;e foibles.</P>
<P N="14">14. Let me therefore advi&s;e you, my dear Sophy, carefully to &s;hun both the&s;e characters, as they are not only ridiculous, but (what is &s;till wor&s;e) as they are dangerous. Never affect an appearance of great|er
<PB N="136" REF="037446_0137_100D0DA290EDBD80">
gaiety on the one hand, nor of greater &s;olemnity on the other, than true and unaffected mode&s;ty requires. Endeavour to po&s;&s;e&s;s your mind with a deep &s;en&s;e and a &s;incere love of this virtue, and then look and act as nature directs. This, in my opinion, is the only in|fallible method of having a mode&s;t deportment. With|out this, indeed, your behaviour may be compo&s;ed, &s;edate, formal, ceremonious, and what not; but it can never be truly and unaffectedly mode&s;t.</P>

<P N="1">1. DOROTHY SCHLOZER, is the daughter of Augu&s;tus Lewis Schlozer, profe&s;&s;or of Phi|lo&s;ophy in the Univer&s;ity of Gottengen, and well known as an able politician and hi&s;torian. She was born Augu&s;t 10, 1770, and in her earlie&s;t years, di&s;|covered an uncommon &s;hare of under&s;tanding, which has been &s;ince improved by extraordinary application. Her father encouraged perhaps by the &s;ucce&s;s he met with in the care of the education of his pre&s;ent Lady, whom he in&s;tructed when only eight years of age, hath had the &s;ole direction of her &s;tudies. The pro|gre&s;s &s;he made in her infancy was very rapid. She &s;oon learned to articulate, and at the age of two years and eight months, was taught low German, a lan|guage almo&s;t foreign to her own, and plain needle
<PB N="139" REF="037446_0140_100D0DDB4AD48988">
work. Soon afterwards &s;he began the French, not by burthening her infant mind with Grammar rules, but by habituating her to conver&s;e with a female &s;er|vant a native of France, whom her mother engaged for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. In her fifth year &s;he was taught to read German in its pre&s;ent purity, by books compo&s;ed for her amu&s;e|ment by her father. When &s;he was only five years and a quarter old, &s;he received &s;ome le&s;&s;ons in Geometry. This deviating from the common way of commencing with arithmetic; but her father wi&s;hed to try the ex|periment, and &s;ucceded &s;o well, that in a fortnight's time, before &s;he had received ten le&s;&s;ons, &s;he was able to an&s;wer very difficult que&s;tions. Her progre&s;s in the acquirement of modern languages was really a|&s;toni&s;hing.</P>
<P N="3">3. She &s;oon learned both to read and &s;peak Engli&s;h, Italian, Swedi&s;h and Dutch. Having taken a jour|ney with her father to Rome; in le&s;s than five months &s;he was able to talk Italian as fluently as her native tongue&mdash;According to the evidence of the <HI>Abbe Denina</HI> in his <HI>Lettere Brandenburghen,</HI> printed at Berlin in 1786. Be&s;ides her knowledge of languages, &s;he ap|plied them to their proper u&s;es, and made her&s;elf ac|quainted with almo&s;t every branch of polite literature. Her father has not confined her to the &s;tudy of any &s;ci|ence in particular, but &s;he has been led by choice to pay the greate&s;t attention to the Mathematics.</P>
<P N="4">4. Mi&s;s Schlozer, though highly celebrated for her erudition, does not neglect what are e&s;teemed the fir&s;t female accompli&s;hments. She plays upon the harp&s;icord, and &s;ings with as much ta&s;te as &s;he draws and works.</P>
<P>Her per&s;on is plea&s;ing, and her dre&s;s as unaffected|ly ea&s;y as her deportment. Her knowledge of hi&s;to|ry, and other literary acquirements render her very
<PB N="140" REF="037446_0141_100D0DA603E86590">
agreeable in company, for &s;he has too much good-na|ture to be re&s;erved, and too much &s;en&s;e to be pre|&s;uming.</P>
<P N="5">5. Her &s;urpri&s;ing talents and accompli&s;hments be|coming the general topic of conver&s;ation, &s;he was propo&s;ed by the great <HI>Orientali&s;t, Michaelis,</HI> as a pro|per &s;ubject for Academical honors. The philo&s;ophi|cal faculty, of which Profe&s;&s;or Michaelis is dean, was judged to be the fitte&s;t, and the 25th of Augu&s;t was fixed upon, at her own reque&s;t, for examination. The examination was held at the Dean's hou&s;e, in the pre&s;ence of the Profe&s;&s;ors&mdash;Kae&s;tner, Neyne, Gatterer, Mei&s;ter, Feder, and Kulenkamp.</P>
<P N="6">6. She was introduced by Michaelis him&s;elf, and di&s;tingui&s;hed as a lady, with the highe&s;t &s;eat.</P>
<P N="7">7. Several que&s;tions were fir&s;t propo&s;ed to her in mathematics, all of which &s;he an&s;wered to their &s;a|tisfaction.&mdash;After this &s;he gave a free tran&s;lation of the thirty-&s;eventh ode of the fir&s;t book of <HI>Horace,</HI> and explained it. The examination la&s;ted from five o'clock till half pa&s;t &s;even, when &s;he was de&s;ired to withdraw for a few minutes, and in her ab&s;ence unanimou&s;ly pronounced worthy of the degree of <HI>Doctor of Philo|&s;ophy!</HI></P>
<P N="8">8, When &s;he was de&s;ired to return, and received the hearty congratulations of her examiners, &s;he thanked them for the honor, and told them, &s;he fear|ed it was conferred too early; but that &s;he hoped to be de&s;erving of it in five years time As &s;oon as &s;he was declared &s;ucce&s;sful, Mi&s;s Michaelis, one of the Profe&s;&s;or's daughters, pre&s;ented her with a wreath of laurel, with which, at the reque&s;t of the Profe&s;&s;ors, &s;he returned crowned, to her father. Her degree was publicly conferred in the Univer&s;ity Church, and her Diploma pre&s;ented to her, on the grand day of the jubilee, September 17, 1787.</P>

<HEAD>LIFE OF MADAME DU CHATELET.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. GABRIELLA-EMILA, Marchione&s;s du Cha|telet, was de&s;cended from a very ancient fa|mily, of Picardy. She was the daughter of the Baron de Breteuil, introducer of foreign Princes and Amba&s;|&s;adors at court, and was born on the 17th of Decem|ber, 1706. At a very early age &s;he di&s;played great &s;trength of genius, and vivacity of imagination. She &s;hewed a peculiar fondne&s;s for the Belles Lettres, and deuoted great part of the early period of her life to the &s;tudy of the ancients. Virgil, above all, was her favorite author. She applied al&s;o to the foreign lan|guages; and, in a little time, made her&s;elf &s;o far ac|quainted with the Engli&s;h and Italian, as to be able to tran&s;late <HI>Milton</HI> and <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;o,</HI> with ea&s;e.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="142" REF="037446_0143_100D0DA794FF7D00">2. Madame du Chatelet, however, did not confine her&s;elf to the &s;tudy of the Belles Letters. Metaphy|&s;ics and Mathematics were objects al&s;o of her pur&s;uit; and Leibnitz, a philo&s;opher equally profound and in|genious, was the guide whom &s;he cho&s;e to direct her in this new path. By clo&s;e application, &s;he was &s;oon enabled to write an explanation of that celebrated German's Philo&s;ophy, under the title of "In&s;titutions of Phy&s;ics," which &s;he compo&s;ed pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cipally for the u&s;e of the Count Chatelet-Lelomont, her &s;on:&mdash; Among other things &s;he reque&s;ts him to attend to the early improvement of his mind&mdash;"You mu&s;t accu&s;|tom your mind early, &s;ays &s;he, to think; and to find re&s;ources in it&s;elf; you will be &s;en&s;ible, throughout life, what comfort and con&s;olation ari&s;es from &s;tudy; and you will even &s;ee that it can afford plea&s;ure and delight."</P>
<P N="3">3. Madame du Chatelet had too much judgment, and was too ardent in the pur&s;uit of truth to dwell long on the Chimeras of metaphy&s;ics; &s;he readily quitted, therefore, the imaginations of Leibnitz, in order to giue her&s;elf up to the clean and per&s;picuous doctrines of Newton. Having by clo&s;e application, gained a complete knowledge of that eminent Philo&s;opher's principles, &s;he undertook the arduous ta&s;k of making a tran&s;lation of them from the original Latin, into French, which publi&s;hed, with an admirable com|mentary, and by this enterprize rendered an e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to &s;cience; This commentary, which is far &s;uperior to the tran&s;lation, is compo&s;ed of two parts, and is preceded by a &s;hort hi&s;tory of <HI>A&s;tronomy,</HI> from <HI>Pythagorus</HI> to the pre&s;ent time.</P>
<P>When we reflect on the dryne&s;s of the &s;ubject, and the little analogy it has with the delicacy and vivacity of the fair &s;ex, we cannot help admiring the abilities of the Authore&s;s, and calling to mind the following
<PB N="143" REF="037446_0144_100D0DDFB0AFBAD8">
lines, which a French philo&s;opher addre&s;&s;ed to her, in epi&s;tle on Newton's Philo&s;ophy.</P>

<P N="4">4. Madame du Chatelet's manners were no le&s;s e&s;|timable than her talents. Though formed by her figure, her rank, and her knowledge, to be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from the greater part of tho&s;e among whom &s;he lived, &s;he &s;eemed never to be &s;en&s;ible of tho&s;e ad|vantages which &s;he enjoyed. She was fond of glory without o&s;tentation. A woman, who has no other merit than that of being learned, is certainly wanting in her duty to &s;ociety: No reproach of this kind can be ju&s;tly thrown out again&s;t Madame du Chatelet, on this head. Her fondne&s;s for books never made her forget what &s;he owed to her family; &s;he did not think it below her, to enter into all tho&s;e details which are required in the management of a family. In&s;tead of delighting in &s;lander, or ridicule, &s;he often became the advocates of tho&s;e who in her pre&s;ence, were made the object of either.</P>
<P>She died at Lunneville, in the year 1749, &s;ome time after &s;he had been delivered of a child.&mdash;She was a member of &s;everal foreign academies.</P>

<P>I would have you behave towards her as a crea|ture of the &s;ame rank of beings as your&s;elf: and as con&s;i|dering, that it is God alo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e who made a difference in the outward circum&s;tances of your parents and her's: but pray, before we go any further, what are her pa|rents?

<P>That it is appointed for all once to die! And &s;urely, he that made us, knows be&s;t how to di&s;po&s;e of us, and what time is fitte&s;t for our &s;tate of trial here! And you may farther remember that the judge of all the earth mu&s;t do right: he that made us, and brought us fir&s;t into being, has &s;urely a right to di&s;po&s;e of us as he plea&s;es; and 'tis our great happine&s;s, that we are at the di&s;po&s;al, not only of a being of infinite pow|er and wi&s;dom, but al&s;o of a gracious, benevolent, and merciful God, that is willing to be&s;tow happine&s;s on all his creatures, that act con&s;i&s;tent wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h the <HI>rea|&s;onable powers</HI> and <HI>opportunities</HI> he has given them, and are not wilfully ob&s;tinate and di&s;obedient to his laws. Con&s;ider, child, that your thinking of death is not de|&s;igned to make you unhappy, but quite the contrary; they that often think of it, are mo&s;t likely to be pre|pared for it, by not committing any of tho&s;e &s;ins and iniquities that make them afraid of dying. The child that is di&s;obedient to its parents, that &s;teals, tells lies, breaks the &s;abbath, or is guilty of any bad actions, is not only afraid, but a&s;hamed to be brought into their pre&s;ence, either to implore their pardon or to be pu|ni&s;hed for his crimes: and is it not a thou&s;and times wor&s;e to die in your &s;ins, and be brought into the pre|&s;ence of God, and there to be &s;entenced to puni&s;h|ment and mi&s;ery? For though God is merciful, he is al&s;o ju&s;t; and will certainly appoint &s;uch a degree of puni&s;hment to all his rational creatures, that die without repentance and remi&s;&s;ion of their &s;ins, by the blood of his &s;on <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> as is the exact demerit of their iniquities. If you often think of death, you
<PB N="157" REF="037446_0158_100D0DEFB6C7D1A8">
will be afraid of &s;in, as 'tis that alone can make you unhappy in dying. The hone&s;t, the faithful, the obe|dient and the good (&s;uch as I hope your play-fellow was that you have &s;o much lamented the lo&s;s of) have nothing to fear: they enter upon a &s;tate of re&s;t un|known to us, and &s;hall, at the great day of re&s;urrec|tion, have their happy &s;ouls reunited to their new rai|&s;ed bodies, and enter upon a &s;tate of everla&s;ting hap|pine&s;s, in the glorious &s;ociety of God, the holy angels, and as the &s;criptures tell you, the &s;pirits of the ju&s;t, that are made perfect: and a&s;&s;ociate again (perhaps) with their <HI>dear departed friends,</HI> in the ble&s;&s;ed man|&s;ions of eternal felicity!</P>

<P>This, child, is quite beyond your comprehen|&s;ion of mind; but the &s;ame Almighty God, who had a power to create us at fir&s;t, and who breathed into us the breath of life, by which we became living &s;ouls, has certainly a power of doing this.

<P>What proofs are there of a God?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>We may prove the being of a God, by the light of rea&s;on and con&s;cience, by the general acknow|ledgment and con&s;ent of all nations, and by the holy &s;criptures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you thus prove there is a God?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fir&s;t, by rea&s;on, the heavens declare the glo|ry of God, and the firmament &s;heweth his handy work. The &s;un, the moon, and &s;tars; the birds in the air, the fi&s;h in the &s;ea, the bea&s;t in the field, the herbs, gra&s;s and flowers, which grow therein, do all mutu|ally demon&s;trate this great truth; for the&s;e could not make them&s;elves, nor be the product of chance; but were effected by a divine power who is the fir&s;t cau&s;e of all things, and on whom they &s;olely depend. Se|condly, By con&s;cience, this is a witne&s;s e&s;tabli&s;hed by God in every man's brea&s;t, to pre&s;erve the notice and memory of him. We never do our duty, but we perceive a plea&s;ing &s;atisfaction in our minds; and we never tran&s;gre&s;s, but con&s;cience &s;everely corrects and rebukes us; the truth of this every one knows by ex|perience. Thirdly, By the con&s;ent of all nations; the belief of a God is as ancient as the world, and ac|knowledged in all ages by all men, both learned and unlearned: and fourthly, by the &s;criptures: God hath not left him&s;elf without good and &s;ufficient witne&s;&s;es of his having made heaven and earth, the &s;ea, and all things therein, Acts xiv: 15, 17. The invi&s;ible things of God from the creation of the world are clear|ly &s;een, being under&s;tood by the things that are made even his eternal power and God-head: Rom. 1, 20. Whatever we ob&s;erve in nature, in the heavens and upon the earth; and whatever is &s;upernatural, as

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>But might not the world be eternal?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; for we find in the beginning of all things the origin of nations, arts and &s;ciences, the erection of Empires, the time when the &s;everal parts of the world were fir&s;t inhabited; and there is no hi&s;tory a|bove &s;ix thou&s;and years, which proves the world was not eternal, but had a beginning; it mu&s;t therefore be created by an Almighty Power, and none could do this but God; a being infinite and &s;elf exi&s;tent.</P>

<P>How many religions are there in the world?</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Four; the Chri&s;tian; the Religion of the Jews, who wor&s;hip the true God, but do not believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; the Religion of the Pagans, who wor|&s;hip fal&s;e Gods; and that of the Mahometans, which was &s;et up by the pretended prophet &s;ix hundred years after Chri&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Which is the true Religion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Chri&s;tian Religion, which con&s;i&s;ts in the true God, and in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, John 17, 3. This is life eternal, that they might know the only true God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whom he &s;ent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who was this Je&s;us Chri&s;t?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>He was the &s;on of God, the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> whom God promi&s;ed to &s;end into the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can this be clearly proved?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; for we find in the birth, life, death and re&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the characters of the Me&s;|&s;iah which the prophets had foretold, accompli&s;hed, in him; that he al&s;o wrought many miracles, and
<PB N="161" REF="037446_0162_100D0E285464B018">
prophe&s;ied many things that afterwards came to pa&s;s, and being crucified by the Jews, he rai&s;ed him&s;elf from the dead.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>What proofs are there for this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Jews and other enemies of the Chri&s;tian Religion agree, that there was formerly in Judea, a man named Je&s;us, who &s;aid he was the &s;on of God; and the hi&s;tories of Jews and Pagans inform us, that it was in his time, and by him, that this Religion was fir&s;t &s;et up; and the Jews confe&s;s he wrought many miracles, and foretold many things which came to pa&s;s after his death, particularly the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;a|lem, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of his church throughout the world: and as to his re&s;urrection from the dead, we &s;hall &s;peak of that hereafter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>By whom was the Chri&s;tian Religion preached?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>By the Apo&s;tles; who did not con&s;train men to embrace it by force, but only had recour&s;e to their preaching and miracles, even when force was made u&s;e of again&s;t them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>How does it appear that the Chri&s;tian Religion is true?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>From the very nature of it; for all that it teaches and commands men to believe and do is perfect|ly agreeable to right <HI>rea&s;on</HI> and ju&s;tice. The Chri&s;|tian Religion requires nothing but what is rea&s;onable, ju&s;t, and worthy of God and man; it tends to make order, ju&s;tice and peace reign among&s;t men; it &s;ancti|fies, comforts, and procures them the greate&s;t happi|ne&s;s they can enjoy in this world, and in a future &s;tate.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then is there &s;o little religion and piety among men?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Becau&s;e the greate&s;t part do not know the re|ligion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, not being well in&s;tructed there|in when young; &s;o that their pa&s;&s;ions and love to the world have hindered them from con&s;idering its beauty
<PB N="162" REF="037446_0163_100D0DF390DC7B88">
and excellence: but whoever fairly and candidly exa|mines, will find, that there is nothing more true, ex|cellent, or nece&s;&s;ary than this holy religion; and if we believe what it teaches, and perform what it com|mands, we &s;hall be everla&s;tingly happy, or if we fail therein, we &s;hall be eternally mi&s;erable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you prove the &s;criptures to be true?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>By the per&s;ons who wrote them, and the things they contain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who are the authors of the Scriptures?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mo&s;es and the Prophets wrote the Old Te&s;ta|ment, the Apo&s;tles and Di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t the new<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and that tho&s;e men were the authors of tho&s;e books, is a truth that has been ack<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">wledged by Jews and Pagans, as well as Chri&s;tians. It is mo&s;t evident they were men of integrity and piety, and reported what they knew to be true.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>But might not the Apo&s;tles and Prophets de|ceive the world?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; becau&s;e they were in&s;pired by God; and be&s;ides, there were a great number of per&s;ons who knew that what they wrote was true; and had it been fal&s;e, their writings would not have been received as divine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>How do you prove the truth of &s;cripture by the things it contains?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>By the hi&s;tories it relates, by the doctrines it teaches, and by the commandments it pre&s;cribes. The &s;acred hi&s;tory agrees as to time, events, per&s;ons and circum&s;tances, with other credible hi&s;tories, even with the Pagans, who wrote before and after Chri&s;t. The doctrines agree with the light of rea&s;on, and the na|tural &s;entiments of men, &s;uch as that there is a God, and future puni&s;hments for the wicked, and rewards for the good. The commands are al&s;o agreeable to that which nature, rea&s;on, and con&s;cience dictate;
<PB N="163" REF="037446_0164_100D0E2AAA813DA8">
for that we &s;hould fear the deity, be ju&s;t and tempe|rate, and not to do to others what we would not have them do to us, are points all men in all ages have be|lieved and agree in.</P>

<P>How do you prove the &s;criptures came from God?</P>

<P>Becau&s;e we find &s;everal things therein which could come from none but God. As 1&s;t, A doctrine mo&s;t holy, &s;ublime, and perfect. 2dly, It is accom|panied with the power of the &s;pirit of God, which &s;anctifies the heart, and produces inward con&s;olation and joy. 3dly, The miracles which the prophets and apo&s;tles wrought, clearly demon&s;trate that God &s;ent them, and &s;poke by them. 4th, The prophecies or predictions of things to come, prove it with the great|e&s;t evidence. Many ages before Chri&s;t, the Jews had the predictions of the prophets in the Old Te&s;tament as we now have; and the three fir&s;t go&s;pels were pub|li&s;hed long before the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem, and other events therein foretold, came to pa&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>S.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why were the &s;criptures given us?</P>

<P>The rainbow is very glorious, but it &s;oon vani&s;heth away; life is good, but it is quickly &s;wallowed up in death.</P>
