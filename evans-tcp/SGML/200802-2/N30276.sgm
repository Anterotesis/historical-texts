<Q><BIBL><HI>ACTS xix. 2.</HI></BIBL> Have ye received the Holy Gho&s;t &s;ince ye believed?</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_TWO Con&s;tructions have been given us of the&s;e Words; &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed, that the Que&s;tion here put, is, Whether the&s;e Di&s;ciples, whom St. <HI>Paul</HI> found at <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> after he had pa&s;&s;ed thro' the upper Coa&s;ts, had received the Holy Gho&s;t, by Impo&s;ition of Hands at Confirmation. &mdash; Others think, that the&s;e Di&s;ciples had been already bapti&s;ed into <HI>John</HI>'s Bapti&s;m; but that not being attended with an immediate Effu&s;ion of the Holy Spirit, the Apo&s;tle here a&s;ks them, <HI>Whether they had received the Holy Gho&s;t by being bapti&s;ed into</HI> JESUS CHRIST? And upon their an&s;wering in the Negative, he fir&s;t bapti&s;ed, and then confirmed them in the Name of the Lord JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>Which of the&s;e Interpretations is mo&s;t true, is neither ea&s;y nor very nece&s;&s;ary to determine. However, as the Words contain a mo&s;t important Enquiry, without any Reference to the Context, I &s;hall from them draw the&s;e two general Heads of Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I &s;hall &s;hew who the Holy Gho&s;t here &s;poken of, is; and how we mu&s;t all receive him before we can be &s;tiled <HI>True Believers.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. <HI>Secondly,</HI> I &s;hall lay down &s;ome Scripture Marks, whereby we may know, <HI>Whether we have thus re|ceived the Holy Gho&s;t, or not?</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="3" REF="040228_0003_1015D4D8E58C6D40">III. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> By Way of Conclu&s;ion, I &s;hall addre&s;s my&s;elf to &s;everal di&s;tinct Cla&s;&s;es of Profe&s;&s;ors, con|cerning the Doctrine that &s;hall have been delivered.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">I. And <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I am to &s;hew who the Holy Gho&s;t, &s;po|ken of in the Text is; and how we mu&s;t all receive him ere we can be &s;tiled <HI>True Believers.</HI></P>
<P>By the Holy Gho&s;t here &s;poken of, is &s;ignified the Holy Spirit, the third Per&s;on in the ever ble&s;&s;ed Trinity, con|&s;ub&s;tantial and coeternal with the Father and the Son, pro|ceeding from, yet equal to them both.&mdash;He is emphati|cally called <HI>Holy,</HI> becau&s;e infinitely Holy in him&s;elf, and the Author and Fini&s;her of all Holine&s;s in us.</P>
<P>This ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, who once moved on the Face of the great Deep, who over&s;hadowed the Ble&s;&s;ed Virgin be|fore that Holy Thing was born of her, who de&s;cended in a bodily Shape like a Dove on our Ble&s;&s;ed LORD, when he came up out of the Water at his Bapti&s;m; and lighted afterwards in fiery Tongues on the Heads of all his Apo|&s;tles at the Day of <HI>Penteco&s;t</HI>; this is the Holy Gho&s;t, who mu&s;t move on the Faces of our Souls; this Power of the Mo&s;t High mu&s;t come upon us, and we mu&s;t be bapti&s;ed with his Bapti&s;m and refining Fire, before we can be &s;tiled True Members of its my&s;tical Body.</P>
<P>Thus &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, <HI>Know ye not that Chri&s;t is in you?</HI> that is, by his Spirit, <HI>unle&s;s you are Reprobates?</HI> Now if any Man hath not the Spirit of CHRIST, he is none of his. &mdash; And again, &s;ays St. <HI>John, We know that we are his by the Spirit that he hath given us.</HI></P>
<P>It is not indeed nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould have it now given in that miraculous Manner in which it was at fir&s;t given to our Lord's Apo&s;tles, by Signs and Wonders. But it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould receive the Holy Gho&s;t in his &s;anctifying Graces as really as they did, and &s;o will it continue to be till the End of the World.</P>
<P>For thus &s;tands the Ca&s;e between GOD and Man.
<PB N="4" REF="040228_0004_1015D4DB6E31CE40">
GOD at fir&s;t made Man upright, or as the &s;acred Pen-man expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>In the Image of GOD made he Man,</HI> that is, his Soul was the very Copy, the Tran&s;cript of the Divine Nature.&mdash;He that before had by his Almighty Fiat &s;poke the World into Being, breathed into Man the Breath of &s;piritual Life, and his Soul became adorned with all the Perfections of the Deity,&mdash;This was the fini&s;h|ing Stroke of the Creation: The Perfection both of the moral and material World,&mdash;and &s;o near re&s;embled its Divine Original, that GOD could not but rejoyce, and take Plea&s;ure in his own Likene&s;s&mdash;And therefore we read, that when GOD had fini&s;hed the inanimate and bruti&s;h Part of the Creation, he looked upon it, and be|hold it was <HI>Good</HI>; but when that lovely God-like Crea|ture, <HI>Man,</HI> was made, behold it was <HI>very Good.</HI></P>
<P>Happy then, un&s;peakably happy mu&s;t Man needs be, who was thus Partaker of the Divine Nature; and thus might we have &s;till continued, had he &s;till continued Holy. But GOD had placed him in a State of Probation, with a free Grant to eat of every Tree in the Garden of <HI>Eden,</HI> except the Tree of Knowlege of Good and Evil.&mdash;The Day he did eat thereof he was &s;urely to die; that is, not only to be &s;ubject to temporal, but &s;piritual Death, and con&s;equently to lo&s;e that Divine Image, that &s;piritual Life GOD had not long &s;ince breathed into him, and which was as much his Happine&s;s as his Glory.</P>
<P>The&s;e, one would imagine, were ea&s;y Conditions for a finite Creature's Happine&s;s to depend on. But Man, unhappy Man, being &s;educed by the Devil, and de&s;iring like him, to be equal with his Maker, eat of the forbidden Fruit, and thereby became liable to that Cur&s;e which the Eternal GOD, who cannot lie, had denounced again&s;t his Di&s;obedience.</P>
<P>Accordingly we read, that &s;oon after <HI>Adam</HI> had fallen, he complained that he was naked.&mdash;Naked not only as
<PB N="5" REF="040228_0005_1015D4DD1F0A4230">
to his Body, but Naked and left de&s;titute of tho&s;e Divine Graces, which before decked and beautified his Soul.&mdash; The unhappy Mutiny and Di&s;order which the vi&s;ible Creation fell into, tho&s;e Briars and Thorns which now &s;prung up and over&s;pread the Earth, were but poor Em|blems, but lifele&s;s Repre&s;entations of that Confu&s;ion and Rebellion, tho&s;e divers Lu&s;ts and Pa&s;&s;ions which &s;prung up in, &amp; quite overwhelmed the Soul of Man immediately after the Fall.&mdash;Alas! he was now no longer the Image of the invi&s;ible GOD; but as he had imitated the Devil's Sin, he became Partaker of the Devil's Nature, and from an Union with, &s;unk into a State of direct Enmity again&s;t GOD.</P>
<P>Now in this dreadful di&s;ordered Condition are all of us brought into the World.&mdash;For as the Root is, &s;uch mu&s;t the Branches be.&mdash; Accordingly we are told, that <HI>Adam</HI> begat a Son in his own Likene&s;s, that is with the &s;ame corrupt Nature which he him&s;elf had &s;unk into after he had eaten the forbidden Fruit. And Experience, as well as Scripture proves, that we al&s;o are altogether born in Sin and Corruption, and therefore uncapable, whil&s;t in &s;uch a State, to hold Communion with GOD.&mdash;For as Light cannot have Communion with Darkne&s;s, &s;o GOD can have no Communion with &s;uch polluted Sons of <HI>Belial.</HI></P>
<P>Here then appears the End and De&s;ign why CHRIST was made manife&s;t in the Fle&s;h.&mdash;<HI>viz.</HI> to put an End to the&s;e Di&s;orders, and to re&s;tore us to that primitive Dig|nity in which we were at fir&s;t created.&mdash;Accordingly he &s;hed his precious Blood to &s;atisfy his Father's Ju&s;tice for our Sins, and thereby al&s;o he purcha&s;ed again for us the HOLY GHOST, who &s;hould once more re-in&s;tamp the Divine Image upon our Hearts, and make us capable of living with and enjoying GOD.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="040228_0006_1015D4E004427C10">This, I &s;ay, was the only End of our LORD's com|ing into the World&mdash;Nay, this is the only End why the World it&s;elf is now kept in Being. For as &s;oon as a &s;uf|ficient Number are &s;anctified out of it, the Heavens &s;hall be wrapped up like a Scrowl, the Elements &s;hall melt with fervent Heat, the Earth and all that therein is &s;hall be burnt up.</P>
<P>This is that New-Birth mentioned by our ble&s;&s;ed LORD to <HI>Nicodemus,</HI> without which we cannot &s;ee the King|dom of GOD. This is what St. <HI>Paul</HI> calls being renew|ed in the Spirit of our Minds, and herein con&s;i&s;ts that Holine&s;s without which no Man &s;hall &s;ee the LORD.</P>
<P>In this manner then it is undeniably certain we mu&s;t receive the HOLY GHOST e'er we can be &s;tiled true Members of CHRIST'S my&s;tical Body.</P>
<P N="2">II. I come now, in the <HI>Second</HI> Place, to lay down &s;ome &s;criptural Marks, whereby we may ea&s;ily judge whether we have received the HOLY GHOST or not.</P>
<P>And the <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> Mark I &s;hall mention is,&mdash; our having received a Spirit of Prayer and Supplication:&mdash;For that always accompanies the Spirit of Grace&mdash;No &s;ooner was <HI>Paul</HI> converted, but behold he prayeth, &s;ays JESUS CHRIST. And this was urged as an Argument to con|vince <HI>Ananias</HI> that he was converted. And GOD's Elect are &s;aid to cry to him Day and Night.</P>
<P>For &s;ince one great Work of the Holy Spirit is to con|vince us of Sin, and to &s;et us upon &s;eeking Pardon and renewing Grace thro' the all &s;ufficient Merits of a cruci|fied Redeemer, who&s;oever has felt the Powers of the World to come awakening him from his Spiritual Le|thargy, cannot but be always crying, out, LORD, what would&s;t thou have me do? Or in the Language of the importunate blind <HI>Bartimeus,</HI> JESUS, thou Son of <HI>Da|vid,</HI> have Mercy upon me.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="040228_0007_1015D4E2A13DCFB8">The ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, as he received the Holy Gho&s;t with|out Mea&s;ure, &s;o he evidenced it by nothing more than his frequent Addre&s;&s;es at the Throne of Grace. Accor|dingly we read, that he was often alone on the Moun|tain Praying&mdash; That he ro&s;e a great while before Day to Pray.&mdash;Nay that he &s;pent whole Nights in Prayer. And who&s;oever is made Partaker of the &s;ame Spirit with the HOLY JESUS, will be of the &s;ame Mind, and delight in nothing &s;o much as to draw nigh unto GOD, and lift up holy Hands and Hearts in fervent and devout Prayer.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed indeed that this Spirit of Supplica|tion is often as it were &s;en&s;ibly lo&s;t, and decays for &s;ome Time even in tho&s;e who have actually received the Holy Gho&s;t. And they, thro' &s;piritual Dryne&s;s and Barren|ne&s;s of Soul, find in them&s;elves a Li&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s and Back|wardne&s;s to this Duty of Prayer;&mdash;but then they take it as their Cro&s;s, and &s;till per&s;evere in &s;eeking JESUS tho' it be &s;orrowing. And their Hearts notwith&s;tanding are fixed upon GOD, tho' they cannot exert their Affections &s;o &s;trongly as u&s;ual, on Account of that &s;piritual Dead|ne&s;s which GOD for wi&s;e Rea&s;ons has &s;uffered to be|numb their Souls.</P>
<P>But as for the formal Believer, it is not &s;o with him. No, he either prays not at all, or if he does enter into his Clo&s;et, it is with Reluctance&mdash;out of Cu&s;tom&mdash;or to &s;atisfy the Checks of his Con&s;cience&mdash;Whereas the true Believer can no more live without Prayer, than with|out Food Day by Day. And he finds his Soul as really and perceptibly fed by the one, as his Body is nouri&s;hed and &s;upported by the other.</P>
<P>A Second Scripture Mark of our having received the HOLY GHOST, is&mdash; not committing Sin.&mdash;</P>
<P><HI>Who&s;oever is born of GOD,</HI> &s;ays St. <HI>John, &s;inneth not, nei|ther can he &s;in, becau&s;e his Seed remaineth in him</HI>&mdash;Neither can he &s;in&mdash;This Expre&s;&s;ion does not imply the Impo&s;&s;i|bility
<PB N="8" REF="040228_0008_1015D4E617DFCD18">
of a &s;piritual Man's &s;inning. For we are told, that in many Things we offend all. It means only thus much; that a Man that is really born again of GOD, doth not wilfully commit Sin, much le&s;s live in the ha|bitual Practice if it. For how &s;hall he that is dead to Sin, as every converted Per&s;on is, live any longer therein?</P>
<P>'Tis true a Man that is born again of GOD may, thro' Surprize or Violence of a Temptation, fall into an Act of Sin: Witne&s;s the Adultery of <HI>David,</HI> and <HI>Peter's</HI> Denial of his Ma&s;ter. But then, like them, he quickly ri&s;es again, goes out from the World, and weeps bitterly; wa&s;hes the Guilt of Sin away by the Tears of a &s;incere Repentance, joined with Faith in the Blood of JESUS CHRIST; takes double Heed to his Ways for the future, and perfects Holine&s;s in the Fear of GOD.</P>
<P>The Meaning of this Expre&s;&s;ion of the Apo&s;tle, that a Man that is born again of GOD, cannot commit Sin, has been <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>LAW's</HI> Chri&s;tian Perfection.</NOTE> fitly illu&s;trated in the Example of a covetous Worldling, to the general Bent of who&s;e Inclinations, Liberality and Profu&s;ene&s;s are directly oppo&s;ite. But if, upon &s;ome unexpected &s;udden Occa&s;ion, he does play the Prodigal, he immediately repents him of his Fault, and returns with double Care to his Savingne&s;s again.&mdash;And &s;o is every one that is born again. To commit Sin is as contrary to the habitual Frame and Tendency of his Mind, as Genero&s;ity is to the Inclinations of a Mi&s;er. But if at any Time he is drawn into Sin, he immedi|ately with double Zeal returns to his Duty, and brings forth Fru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s meet for Repentance.</P>
<P>Whereas the unconverted Sinner is quite dead in Tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es and Sins,&mdash;or if he does ab&s;tain from the gro&s;s Acts of it, from worldly &s;elfi&s;h Motives, yet there is &s;ome Right Eye he will not pluck out; &s;ome Right Hand which he will not cut off; &s;ome &s;pecious <HI>Agag</HI> that he will not &s;acri|fice
<PB N="9" REF="040228_0009_1015D4E79EAE6E60">
for GOD; and thereby he is convinced, that he is but a mere <HI>Saul</HI>; and con&s;equently, whatever Preten|&s;ions he may make to the contrary, he has not yet receiv|ed the HOLY GHOST.</P>
<P>A <HI>Third</HI> Mark whereby we may know whether or not we have received the Holy Gho&s;t is,&mdash;our Conque&s;t over the World.&mdash;For <HI>whoever is born of GOD,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, <HI>overcometh the World.</HI>&mdash;By the World we are to under&s;tand, as St. <HI>John</HI> expre&s;&s;es it, all that is in the World, the Lu&s;t of the Eye, the Lu&s;t of the Fle&s;h, and Pride of Life.&mdash;And by overcoming of it is meant our renouncing the&s;e, &s;o as not to follow or be led by them. For who&s;oever is born from above, has his Affections &s;et on Things above: He feels a Divine Attraction in his Soul, which forcibly draws his Mind Heavenwards; and as the Hart panteth after the Water-Brooks, &s;o doth it make his Soul to long after the Enjoyment of his GOD.</P>
<P>Not that he is &s;o taken up with the Affairs of another Life, as to neglect the Bu&s;ine&s;s of this. No, a truly &s;piritual Man dares not &s;tand any Day idle: But then he takes Care, though he laboureth for the Meat which peri&s;heth, fir&s;t to &s;ecure that which endureth to everla&s;t|ing Life. Or if GOD has exalted him above his Bre|thren, yet, like <HI>Mo&s;es, Jo&s;eph</HI> and <HI>Daniel,</HI> he notwith|&s;tanding looks upon him&s;elf as a Stranger and Pilgrim upon Earth.&mdash; Having received a Principle of new Life, he walks by Faith and not by Sight.&mdash; And his Hopes being full of Immortality, he can look on all Things here below as Vanity and Vexation of Spirit.&mdash;In &s;hort, tho' he is in, yet is not of the World: And as he was made for the Enjoyment of GOD, &s;o nothing but GOD can &s;atisfy his Soul.</P>
<P>The ever ble&s;&s;ed JESUS was a perfect In&s;tance of over|coming the World. For tho' he went continually about doing Good, and always lived in a Pre&s;s, yet wherever
<PB N="10" REF="040228_0010_1015D4EA359D3070">
he was, his Conver&s;ation tended Heavenwards. In like Manner he that is joined to the LORD in one Spirit, will &s;o order his Tho'ts, Words, &amp; Actions aright that he will evidence to all, that his Conver&s;ation is in Heaven.</P>
<P>On the contrary, an unconverted Man being of the Earth, is earthly: And having no &s;piritual Eye to di&s;|cern &s;piritual Things, is always &s;eeking for Happine&s;s in this Life, where it never was, will, or can be found. Be|ing not born again from above, he is bowed down by a Spirit of natural Infirmity; the Serpent's Cur&s;e becomes his Choice, and he eats of the Du&s;t of the Earth all the Days of his Life.</P>
<P>A <HI>Fourth</HI> Scripture Mark of our <HI>New-Birth,</HI> or of our having received the Holy Gho&s;t, is,&mdash; our loving one another.</P>
<P><HI>We know,</HI> &s;ays St. <HI>John, we are pa&s;&s;ed from Death unto Life, becau&s;e we love the Brethren.&mdash;And by this</HI> &s;ays JESUS CHRIST, <HI>&s;hall all Men know, that you are my Di&s;|ciples, if ye have Love one toward another.</HI>&mdash;Love is the fulfilling of the Go&s;pel, as well as the Law; for GOD is Love, &amp; who&s;oever dwelleth in GOD, dwelleth in Love.</P>
<P>But by this Love we are not to under&s;tand, a Softne&s;s and Tenderne&s;s of meer Nature, or a Love founded on worldly Motives (for this a natural Man may have) but a Love of our Brethren proceeding from a Love towards GOD. Loving all Men in general, becau&s;e GOD loves all Men, &amp; loving good Men in particular, for the Grace we &s;ee in them, and becau&s;e they love our Lord JESUS in Sincerity.</P>
<P>This is Chri&s;tian Charity, and that new Command|ment which CHRIST gave his Di&s;ciples. New not in its Object, but in the Motive and Example whereon it is founded, even JESUS CHRIST. This is that Love which the primitive Chri&s;tians were &s;o renowned for, that it be|came a Proverb.&mdash;<HI>See, how the&s;e Chri&s;tians love one ano|ther.</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="040228_0011_1015D4EEAC302DF8">
&mdash;And without this Love, tho' we &s;hould give all our Goods to feed the Poor, and our Bodies to be burnt, it would profit us nothing.</P>
<P>Farther, this Love is not confined to any particular Set of Men, but is impartial and catholic. A Love that em|braces GOD'S Image where-ever it beholds it, and that delights in nothing &s;o much as to &s;ee CHRIST'S King|dom come.</P>
<P>This is the Love wherewith JESUS CHRIST loved Mankind.&mdash;He loved all, even the wor&s;t of Men, as ap|pears by his weeping over the ob&s;tinately perver&s;e; but wherever he &s;aw the lea&s;t Appearance of the Divine Like|ne&s;s, that Soul he loved in particular.&mdash;Thus we read, that when he heard the young Man &s;ay, <HI>All the&s;e Things have I kept from my Youth,</HI> that &s;o far he loved him. And when he &s;aw any noble In&s;tance of Faith, tho' in a <HI>Cen|turion,</HI> a <HI>Syro-phaenician,</HI> Aliens to the Commonwealth of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> how is he &s;aid to marvel at it, as Man, to re|joyce in it, &s;peak of, and commend it?&mdash;So al&s;o every &s;piritual Di&s;ciple of JESUS CHRIST will cordially em|brace all that wor&s;hip GOD in Spirit and in Truth, how|&s;oever they may differ as to the Appendages of Religion, and Things not e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to Salvation.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s indeed that the Heart of a natural Man is not thus enlarged all at once; and a Per&s;on may really have received the Holy Gho&s;t (as <HI>Peter</HI> no doubt had when he was unwilling to go to <HI>Cornelius)</HI> tho' he be not arri|ved to this.&mdash;But then we affirm, where a Per&s;on is truly in CHRIST, all Narrowne&s;s of Spirit decrea&s;es in him daily; the Partition-Wall of Bigotry and Party Zeal is broken down more and more; and the nearer he comes to Heaven the more his Heart is enlarged with that Love which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">here will make no Difference between any Peo|ple, Nation or Language, but we &s;hall all with one Heart, and one Voice, &s;ing Prai&s;es to him that &s;itteth upon the Throne for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="040228_0012_1015D4F16351EA78">But I ha&s;ten to &s;hew a <HI>Fifth,</HI> and that the la&s;t Scrip|ture Mark of our <HI>New-Birth,</HI> that I &s;hall at pre&s;ent men|tion,&mdash;Loving our Enemies.</P>
<P><HI>I &s;ay unto you,</HI> &s;ays JESUS CHRIST, <HI>Love your Enemies, ble&s;s them that cur&s;e you, do good to tho&s;e that hate you, and pray for them that de&s;pitefully u&s;e you and per&s;ecute you.</HI>&mdash; And this Duty of loving our Enemies is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that without it, our ble&s;&s;ed LORD tells us our Righteou&s;ne&s;s does not exceed the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of the <HI>Scribes</HI> &amp; <HI>Pha|ri&s;ees,</HI> nay, or of <HI>Publicans</HI> and Sinners: For if you do Good to them only which do Good to you, what do you more than others? What do you extraordinary? Do not even <HI>Publicans</HI> the &s;ame? &mdash; And the&s;e Precepts our LORD confirmed by his own Example, when he wept over the bloody City; when he &s;uffered him&s;elf to be led as a Sheep to the Slaughter; when he made that mild Re|ply to the Traytor <HI>Judas, Judas betraye&s;t thou the Son of Man with a Ki&s;s</HI>;&mdash;And more e&s;pecially when in the Agonies &amp; Pangs, of Death, he prayed for his very Mur|derers, <HI>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.</HI></P>
<P>This is the mo&s;t difficult Duty to the natural Man, but who&s;oever is made Partaker of that Promi&s;e of the Father, will find it practicable and ea&s;y. For if we are born again of GOD, we mu&s;t be like him; and con&s;e|quently delight to be perfect in this Duty of doing good to our wor&s;t Enemies in the &s;ame Manner, tho' not in the &s;ame Degree as he is perfect.&mdash;And he &s;ends his Rain on the Evil and the Good, cau&s;eth his Sun to &s;hine on the Ju&s;t and Unju&s;t: And herein more e&s;pecially com|mendeth his Love towards us, that whil&s;t we were his Enemies, he &s;ent forth his Son, born of a Woman, made under the Law, that he might become a Cur&s;e for us.</P>
<P>Many other Marks there are &s;cattered up and down the Scriptures, whereby we may know whether or not we have received the Holy Gho&s;t. Such as <HI>to be carnally
<PB N="13" REF="040228_0013_1015D4F359A0C2B0">
minded is Death, but to be &s;piritually minded is Life and Peace.&mdash;Now the Fruits of the Spirit are Joy, Peace, Long-&s;uffering, Meckne&s;s,</HI> with a Multitude of Texts to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e.&mdash;But as mo&s;t, if not all of them, are com|prehended in the Duties already laid down, I dare affirm, who&s;oever, upon an impartial Examination, can find the afore&s;aid Marks upon his Soul, may be as certain, as tho' an Angel was to tell him, that his Pardon is &s;ealed in Heaven.</P>
<P>And as for my own Part, I had rather &s;ee the&s;e Divine Graces, the&s;e Heavenly Tempers &s;tamped upon my Soul, than to hear an Angel from Heaven &s;aying unto me, <HI>Son, be of good cheer, thy Sins be forgiven thee.</HI></P>
<P>For the&s;e are infallible Witne&s;&s;es; the&s;e are <HI>Emanuel,</HI> GOD with and in us; the&s;e make up that white Stone, which none knoweth, &s;aving he who receiveth it; the&s;e are the Earne&s;ts of the Heavenly Inheritance in our Hearts. In &s;hort, the&s;e are Glory begun, and are that good Thing, that better Part, which, if you continue to &s;tir up this Gift of GOD, neither Men or Devils &s;hall ever be able to take from us.</P>
<P N="3">III. I proceed now, as was propo&s;ed, in the <HI>Third</HI> Place, to make an Application of the Doctrine de|livered, to &s;everal di&s;tinct Cla&s;&s;es of Profe&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>And <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I &s;hall addre&s;s my&s;elf to tho&s;e who are dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins.&mdash;And here how could I weep over you, as our LORD wept over <HI>Jeru&s;alem!</HI> For alas! how di&s;tant mu&s;t you be from GOD, what a pro|digious Work have you got to fini&s;h, who in&s;tead of pray|ing Day and Night, &s;eldom or never pray at all! And in&s;tead of being born again in GOD, &s;o as not to commit Sin, are &s;o deeply &s;unk into the Nature of Devils as to make a Mock at it. Or in&s;tead of overcoming the World, &s;o as not to follow or be led by it, are continually making Provi&s;ion for the Fle&s;h, to fulfil the Lu&s;t thereof. And
<PB N="14" REF="040228_0014_1015D4F4E9724E48">
la&s;tly, in&s;tead of being endued with the Godlike Di&s;po|&s;itions of loving all Men, even your Enemies, have your Hearts full of Hatred, Malice and Revenge, and deride tho&s;e who are &s;incere Followers of the lowly JESUS. But think you, O Sinners, that GOD will admit &s;uch pollu|ted Wretches into his Sight? Or &s;hould he admit you, do you imagine you could take any Plea&s;ure in him? No, Heaven it&s;elf would be no Heaven to you: The Devili&s;h Di&s;po&s;itions which are in your Hearts would render all the &s;piritual Enjoyments of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed Man|&s;ions ineffectual to make you happy.&mdash;To qualify you to be bli&s;sful Partakers of that Heavenly Inheritance with the Saints in Light, there is a Meetne&s;s required, to at|tain which ought to be the one Bu&s;ine&s;s of your Lives.</P>
<P>It is true, you, as well as the Righteous, in one Sen&s;e &s;hall Seat GOD (for we mu&s;t all appear before the Judg|ment Seat of CHRIST) but you mu&s;t &s;ee him once, ne|ver to &s;ee him more. For as you carry about in you the Devil's Image, with Devils you mu&s;t dwell. Being of the &s;ame Nature, you mu&s;t &s;hare the &s;ame Doom. Re|pent therefore and be converted, that your Sins may be blotted out. See that you receive the Holy Gho&s;t before you go hence: For otherwi&s;e how can you e&s;cape the Damnation of Hell?</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I &s;hall apply my&s;elf to tho&s;e who deceive them|&s;elves with fal&s;e Hopes of Salvation. And becau&s;e, thro' the Influence of a good Education, or other providential Re&s;traints, they have not run into the &s;ame Exce&s;s of Riot with other Men, think they have no Need to re|ceive the Holy Gho&s;t, and flatter them&s;elves that they are really born again.</P>
<P>But do you &s;hew it by bringing forth the Fruits of the Spirit; Do you pray without cea&s;ing? Do you not com|mit Sin? Have you overcome the World? And do you
<PB N="15" REF="040228_0015_1015D4F9D0BCA330">
love your Enemies, and all Mankind, in the &s;ame Man|ner as JESUS CHRIST loved them?</P>
<P>If the&s;e Things, Brethren, be in you, and abound, then may you have Confidence towards GOD: But if not, altho' you may be civilized, yet you are not convert|ed. No, you are yet in your Sins. The Nature of the old <HI>Adam</HI> &s;till reigneth in your Souls. And unle&s;s the Na|ture of the &s;econd <HI>Adam</HI> be engrafted in its Room, you can never &s;ee GOD.</P>
<P>Think not therefore to dre&s;s your&s;elves up in the Or|naments of a good Nature, and civil Education, and &s;ay with <HI>Agag,</HI> &s;urely the Bitterne&s;s of Death is pa&s;t. For GOD'S Ju&s;tice notwith&s;tanding that, like <HI>Samuel,</HI> &s;hall hew you to Pieces.&mdash;However you may be highly e&s;tee|med in the Sight of Men, yet in the Sight of GOD you are but like the Apples of <HI>Sodom,</HI> Dunghills covered over with Snow, mere whited Sepulchres, appearing a little beautiful without, but inwardly full of Corruption and of all Uncleanline&s;s.&mdash;And con&s;equently will be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed at the la&s;t Day, with a <HI>Verily, I know you not.</HI></P>
<P>But the Word is profitable for Comfort, as well as Cor|rection.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> therefore do I addre&s;s my&s;elf to tho&s;e who are under the Drawings of the Father, and are going thro' the Spirit of Bondage, but not finding the Marks before|mentioned, are ever crying out, <HI>Who &s;hall deliver us from the Body of this Death?</HI></P>
<P>But fear not, little Flock; for notwith&s;tanding your pre&s;ent Infant State of Grace, it &s;hall be your Father's good Plea&s;ure to give you the Kingdom.</P>
<P>The Grace of GOD, thro' JESUS CHRIST, that &s;hall deliver you, that &s;hall give you what you thir&s;t after.&mdash; He hath promi&s;ed he will al&s;o do it.&mdash;Ye &s;hall receive the Spirit of Adoption, that Promi&s;e of the Father, if you &s;aint not.&mdash;Only per&s;evere in &s;eeking it,&mdash;and determine
<PB N="16" REF="040228_0016_1015D4FC874ABEB8">
to find no Re&s;t in your Spirit, till you know and feel that you are thus born again from above, &amp; GOD'S Spirit wit|ne&s;&s;eth with your Spirits that you are the Children of GOD.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly</HI> and <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> I addre&s;s my&s;elf to tho&s;e who have received the Holy Gho&s;t in all its &s;anctifying Graces, and almo&s;t ripe for Glory.</P>
<P>Hail happy Saints! For your Heaven is begun on Earth. You have already received the fir&s;t Fruits of the Spirit, and are patiently waiting till that ble&s;&s;ed Change come, when your Harve&s;t &s;hall be compleat.&mdash; I &s;ee &amp; admire you, tho' alas! at &s;o great a Di&s;tance from you.&mdash;Your Life, I know, is hid with CHRIST in GOD.&mdash; You have Comforts, you have Meat to eat, which a &s;inful, carnal, ridiculing World knows nothing of.&mdash; CHRIST'S Yoke is now become ea&s;y to you, and his Burden light: You have pa&s;&s;ed through the Pangs of the <HI>New Birth,</HI> and now rejoice that the Man CHRIST JESUS is &s;piritually formed in your Hearts. You know what it is to dwell in CHRIST, and CHRIST in you. Like <HI>Jacob</HI>'s Ladder, altho' your Bodies are on Earth, yet your Souls and Hearts are in Heaven: And by your Faith and con&s;tant Recollection, like the Ble&s;&s;ed Angels, you do always behold the Face of your Father which is in Heaven.</P>
<P>I need not then exhort you to pre&s;s forward: For you know that in walking by the Spirit there is great Reward. Rather will I exhort you in Patience to po&s;&s;e&s;s your Souls yet a little while, and JESUS CHRIST will deliver you from the Burden of the Fle&s;h, and an abundant En|trance &s;hall be admini&s;tered unto you into the eternal Joy and uninterrupted Felicity of his Heavenly Kingdom.</P>
<Q>Which <HI>GOD</HI> of his infinite Mercy grant, through <HI>JESUS CHRIST</HI> our <HI>LORD;</HI> to whom with the <HI>FATHER</HI> and the <HI>HOLY GHOST,</HI> Three Per&s;ons &amp; One <HI>GOD,</HI> be a&s;|cribed all Honour, Power, and Glory, forever and ever.</Q>
