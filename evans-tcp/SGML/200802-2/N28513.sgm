<P>MY FATHER, MY FATHER! <HI>The Chariot of I&s;rael, and the Hor&s;e-men thereof:</HI>&mdash;This is the pa|thetic cry of Eli&s;ha, on the removal of Elijah from his head, by a whirlwind into heaven, never more to be &s;een! He very &s;en&s;ibly felt the lo&s;s; he bitterly lamented it, by expre&s;&s;ions and actions, indicating great agitation of mind; and the deepe&s;t &s;orrow of heart: He lift up his voice and wept: He took hold of his clothes, and rent them in pieces; intimating, the &s;incerity of his affection to his departed friend; the affliction of his bleeding heart at the mourn|ful event.</P>
<P><HI>My Father, my Father!</HI> The words experts the light in which he viewed him, as &s;tanding in the relation of a kind and tender <HI>Father,</HI> who had ad|mini&s;tred to his in&s;truction, protection, and com|fort. The repetition of the terms, <HI>my Father, my Father!</HI> &s;hews the fullne&s;s of his heart; his <HI>delight,</HI>

his <HI>melancholy delight</HI> in u&s;ing the name, <HI>my Father, my dear Father,</HI> is no more!</P>
<P>The <HI>Chariot of I&s;rael,</HI> and the <HI>Hor&s;e-men</HI> thereof. What an encomium is this, upon Elijah, as a pub|lic ble&s;&s;ing? Chariots and Hor&s;e-men were u&s;ed as means in defence of the country: Elijah is here con&s;idered as equal to all the armies of I&s;rael; to their Chariots and Hor&s;e-men prepared for war, in re&s;pect to his influence and beneficence; and Eli&s;ha laments that this, the glory and defence of I&s;rael, was departed; is extremely affected at the public lo&s;s, &s;u&s;tained by &s;uch a &s;erious, melancholy Providence.</P>
<P>The&s;e words may &s;erve to &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome thoughts, and excite &s;entiments and affections in our hearts, proper to be cheri&s;hed on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion for which they are cho&s;en,<ABBR>viz.</ABBR> To improve the Provi|dence of GOD in the removal of GEORGE WASHINGTON by death.

<P>The Lord JEHOVAH mu&s;t be acknowledged as the &s;upreme Governor among the nations; to u&s;e &s;uch means as he plea&s;eth to plant and build them up; and it becomes us to take notice of the opera|tions of his hands; to notice the in&s;truments he rai&s;|eth up, and ble&s;&s;eth for the good of his people; to give honor, to whom honor is due, and al&s;o, &s;incere|ly to regret the lo&s;s of &s;uch, as have been Fathers and Benefactors to us.</P>

<P>The&s;e propo&s;itions, if largely di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, would open an exten&s;ive field for meditations, and lead me to further reflections upon the interpo&s;ition of heaven in our behalf heretofore, than I have time at pre&s;ent to make; and, to give a minute detail of the character of our late beloved Pre&s;ident and General, which may be more proper for an hi&s;torian to de&s;cribe, than for the preacher to relate.</P>
<P>But let us attend to &s;ome general thoughts that ari&s;e from the ob&s;ervations made on the text.</P>
<P>I. Con&s;ider the goodne&s;s of GOD to his people, in appearing for them under national troubles, and rai&s;ing up men of di&s;tingui&s;hed abilities and accom|pli&s;hments, to be public ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>In this ca&s;e, Elijah was rai&s;ed up to be a &s;pecial ble&s;&s;ing to the t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> tribes of I&s;rael: He acted indeed <HI>principally</HI> in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical line, as a prophet of the LORD, to in&s;truct and reform the people: but in this way he entered upon the mo&s;t direct method to become a benefactor; for righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a nation; and in righteou&s;ne&s;s alone, &s;hall it be e&s;tab|li&s;hed. And we find him giving mo&s;t &s;alutary coun&s;el to kings, how to conduct for the peace and happine&s;s of the country.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="037989_0006_100F6FDB1A21AE98">
It was in a time of affliction, of great di&s;tre&s;s among the people, when GOD rai&s;ed him up to be an eminent ble&s;&s;ing to them. For, after the ten tribes had broken off from the hou&s;e of David; their kings, for political rea&s;ons, &s;educed the people, and re&s;trained them from attending the &s;tated wor|&s;hip of GOD at Jeru&s;alem; whereupon they fell into idolatry. This provoked the LORD to expo&s;e them to the will of their enemies, who grievou&s;ly oppre&s;|&s;ed them.</P>
<P>If we look back from this period to preceding ages of the Jewi&s;h Nation, we &s;hall find their hi&s;tory will furni&s;h us with many in&s;tances of the LORD'S appearing for their deliverance, when reduced to extremities. Pre&s;ently after their &s;ettlement in the promi&s;ed land, their enemies devi&s;ed again&s;t them, to deprive them of their privileges, to rob them of the fruits of their labor, and make &s;laves of them; but when they cried unto the Lord, he had pity on them: He rai&s;ed up and qualified with eminent talents, tho&s;e who re&s;cued them and wrought great &s;alvation; Men to be Judges, Counsellors and Ge|nerals of Armies.</P>
<P>The book of Judges contains an hi&s;tory of diver&s;e in&s;tances of this kind, which is worthy peru&s;ing at this time, that our reflections may excite pious af|fections of &s;oul, to that God, who is &s;o gracious in interpo&s;ing, to redre&s;s the grievances of his people.</P>
<P>A very memorable in&s;tance on &s;acred record, is that of David's being rai&s;ed from keeping &s;heep, to
<PB N="7" REF="037989_0007_100F6FDE018753B0">
be the head of the &s;tates or tribes of I&s;rael. The nation at this period, was in the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s and affliction. The government was di&s;&s;olved, or exer|ci&s;ed in the mo&s;t arbitrary, tyrannical manner. Civil war among them&s;elves; the enemy entering into the heart of the country. Without were fightings, with|in were fears, and great perplexities. David appeared by the appointment of God; and meeting the &s;uf|frages of the people: the enemy from abroad was &s;ubdued; Peace re&s;tored at home; the union of the tribes cordially affected and cemented; the govern|ment e&s;tabli&s;hed and &s;ecured, and a foundation laid for the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing kingdom and happy people, in the next reign, that can be found in the annals of hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>And have not we experienced, are not we living witne&s;&s;es of the great goodne&s;s of GOD to us, as a na|tion, in rai&s;ing up for us, in time of extremity, a <HI>de|liverer,</HI> in the per&s;on of GEORGE WASHING|TON, our late beloved <HI>Pre&s;ident and General?</HI> Though many have done worthily, and have hon|or from their fellow-citizens; yet none, I tru&s;t, will think we mean to derogate from them, when we &s;ay he hath excelled them all: con&s;idering the impor|tant &s;tations he &s;o illu&s;triou&s;ly filled for the public good.</P>
<P>The Father of the &s;pirits of all fle&s;h brought him upon the &s;tage of action, and gave him to this peo|ple, when there was &s;pecial need of his aid and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. The extremity and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the country at
<PB N="8" REF="037989_0008_100F6FE1628ADD70">
that period, are &s;o recent, that they cannot be effac|ed from our minds, and therefore I need not at pre&s;ent recapitulate them. Only to in&s;tance, that our liber|ties were abridged and privileges wre&s;ted from our hands; our dear earned property &s;iezed and plunder|ed; our lives threatned; yea many of our friends and countrymen &s;lain by the &s;word! in the&s;e ex|tremities, when our eyes were unto the LORD of heaven and earth; he &s;ent forth a <HI>deliverer,</HI> furni&s;h|ed with abilities for the important &s;ervices de&s;igned in providence. As he had a large field to act in, many difficulties to encounter, and hard&s;hips to in|dure&punc; He was ble&s;t with a capacious mind; accu|rate judgment, to di&s;cern men and things; an happy talent at diction; princely dignity of &s;oul; great fortitude, tempered with moderation, conde|&s;cen&s;ion and meekne&s;s; with unwearied patience and per&s;everance, fitted to pre&s;ide in council to the great|e&s;t advantage; and lead forth an ho&s;t again&s;t the enemy with happy &s;ucce&s;s. Being cho&s;en of GOD and man to be the &s;aviour of his country, he was endow|ed with accompli&s;hments, through the &s;miles of heaven, to obtain the important object. Scarce ever perhaps, &s;o many eminent gifts and talents, entered into the character of one per&s;on, as in General WASHINGTON. Such maje&s;ty and conde&s;cen|&s;ion! which fitted him to perform great and illu&s;|trious deeds with honor; and the common actions of life, with &s;o much affability and ea&s;e. Con|&s;idering his tenderne&s;s and affection for the people; and benefactions to the country: with what pro|priety

may we adopt the language of my text? <HI>My Father my Father! the Chariot of I&s;rael and the Hor&s;e-men thereof.</HI> As a Father, he engaged without &s;tipend or reward, only a bare &s;upport of his hou&s;e-hold, to act as <HI>General</HI> of the united forces of <HI>Amer|ica</HI> again&s;t the enemy. What pure di&s;intere&s;ted be|nevolence prompted and animated him to undertake in &s;uch an important department; and indure in|credible hard&s;hips and &s;evere&s;t trials, with a&s;toni&s;h|ing patience almo&s;t of a chri&s;tian Martyr?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of this conde&s;cen&s;ion and parental affection to &s;uch as are in the lower walks of life, I was witne&s;s to a very delicate in&s;tance. Riding into a po|pulous town in the mid&s;t of thou&s;ands, who received him with the greate&s;t cordiality and joy:&mdash;He alighted at the place of his lodgings, and imme|diately went forth to a gate fronting the main-&s;treet, to attend a proce&s;&s;ion of youth, members of the &s;everal &s;chools: Who were arranged in divi&s;ions, preceded by their re&s;pective In&s;tructors. While they paid their humble re&s;pects to <HI>him,</HI> he bowed to <HI>them</HI> with a mo&s;t amiable &s;mile: And his countenance, the Index of the &s;oul, &s;hewed the affection and tenderne&s;s of a Father indeed&mdash;The impre&s;&s;ions of &s;uch a &s;cene, I believe, will never be effaced from the grateful hearts of tho&s;e who were pre&s;ent.</NOTE> And &s;uch was his &s;ame and influence, may we not &s;ay, they were equal to an army of Chariots and Hor&s;e-men?</P>
<P>It may be further worthy remarking the goodne&s;s of GOD; and in honor to him whom he rai&s;ed up in our behalf; that he was not athei&s;tical or dei&s;tical in his principles, to influence the people to for&s;ake the wor&s;hip of the true GOD; like Jeroboam, who headed the &s;eperation from the arbitrary King of Judah. But he &s;hewed a profound reverence for the Deity, a regard for the divine oracles, and the in&s;ti|tutions of holy wor&s;hip, and earne&s;tly recommended us by repeated proclamations, humbly to acknow|ledge our dependence on the care and ble&s;&s;ing of Hea|ven, for all de&s;ired pro&s;perity and happine&s;s. What an
<PB N="10" REF="037989_0010_100F6FE6A8088130">
happy circum&s;tance is it, at this day of increa&s;ing in|fidelity, that one of WASHINGTON's &s;tation and influence, hath appeared to check its progre&s;s? Who by his coun&s;il and example hath given his te&s;ti|mony in behalf of our holy religion? A religion accompanied with full evidences of its divinity; tending to refine and purify the human nature; and rai&s;e it to the highe&s;t glory and felicity: A re|ligion de&s;igned and calculated to promote our be&s;t good in time and eternity. To this religion, the GREAT WASHINGTON &s;ub&s;cribed, and ear|ne&s;tly recommended to the people in his affection|ate farewell Addre&s;s, when he retired from public, to private life! and yet &s;ome of an inferior rank, glory in their infidelity, as though wi&s;dom mu&s;t live and die with them.</P>
<P>But WASHINGTON is no more!</P>
<P>This great and illu&s;trious per&s;onage is withdawn from this theatre of action to receive, we tru&s;t, a glo|rious reward in heaven. But though taken from our &s;ight, affectionate thoughts of him are not era&s;|ed from our minds. His memory is deeply record|ed in the grateful hearts of <HI>millions.</HI> His illu&s;tri|ous achievements, his eminent &s;ervices are immor|talized, they are imprinted in indelible characters, to be read and known of all; to be conveyed down from parents to children, to the late&s;t po&s;terity.</P>
<P>What thankfulne&s;s, does it become us to cheri&s;h in our hearts to the ble&s;&s;ed GOD, for rai&s;ing up &s;o
<PB N="11" REF="037989_0011_100F6FE82A5AF8C8">
&s;ea&s;onably for us, &s;uch a public benefactor? and &s;hould not we be deeply impre&s;&s;ed at the &s;ame time with unfeigned grief at the lo&s;s of &s;o great a ble&s;&s;ing?</P>
<P>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away! let us &s;ub&s;cribe, ble&s;&s;ed be the name of the Lord: and &s;ay, that he is holy and righteous in &s;o doing; humbly &s;ubmiting to the rebuke of providence.</P>
<P>Let us not de&s;pi&s;e the cha&s;tening of the Lord, nor faint under his corrections; but make tho&s;e re|flections, which become us as men and chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>II. We ought to take &s;erious notice of the Provi|dence in the removal of eminent benefactors by death, and regret the lo&s;s of them.</P>
<P>It is true they are but men, and like men they die; agreeably to the &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed upon all the human race: yet, as the gift of &s;uch men is a great ble&s;&s;ing; the removal of them is a frown of Provi|dence. There is &s;o much virtue taken from the earth, that cannot well be &s;pared; there is &s;uch an u&s;eful example removed from our eyes, which is needed to &s;timulate &s;urvivors. And though the chief de&s;ign of their being rai&s;ed up, may be an&s;wered; yet in their retirement, their coun&s;els and prayers might be beneficial: in their removal, &s;o much of our glory is departed; &s;o much of our defence taken away, and proportionably we are left feeble and expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Nature dictates, &s;cripture precepts and examples confirm the &s;entiment, that the lo&s;s of our fathers
<PB N="12" REF="037989_0012_100F6FEA970C5C30">
and public benefactors, &s;hould be &s;eriou&s;ly noticed and lamented by &s;urvivors.</P>
<P>As natural affections prompt to mourn the lo&s;s of dear kindred; painfully to lament the vacancy left in the heart; &s;o &s;ocial affections and &s;uch&punc;as ari&s;e from benefits received, will excite &s;ymphathetic &s;en&s;ations in the grateful &s;oul.</P>
<P>Gratitude and due re&s;pect to the living will la|ment the dead. Tho&s;e tender feelings of &s;oul will be &s;en&s;ibly touched; and &s;prings of &s;orrow bur&s;t forth in corre&s;pondent expre&s;&s;ions. Ingratitude is a prin|ciple of the ba&s;e&s;t kind, a bitter root of iniquity &s;uperlatively great! When there aro&s;e a King in Egypt that knew not <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> who had been the father of the country, and the greate&s;t benefactor the na|tion ever enjoyed; the mo&s;t barbarous plan was laid, and executed in part, that could enter the de|praved heart of man, to conceive of. But gratitude and e&s;teem for worthy deeds, and worthy characters, call forth to view whatever has a tendency to em|balm their memories, and convey their names down to po&s;terity with &s;weet perfume. Thus <HI>David</HI> felt for his dear friend decea&s;ed. "I am di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for thee, my brother <HI>Jonathan;</HI> very plea&s;ant ha&s;t thou been unto me."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">II. Samuel, 1. 26.</NOTE></P>
<P>As nature dictates and invites to mourn on &s;uch occa&s;ions, &s;o &s;cripture teaches the propriety, and gives in&s;tances of &s;eriou&s;ly noticing &s;uch &s;cenes. The &s;ons of <HI>Jacob</HI> mourned at his death with a great and fore
<PB N="13" REF="037989_0013_100F6FEF05C80E88">
lamentation, in&s;omuch that the neighboring nations took notice of it as a <HI>grievous</HI> mourning. When <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> died, the children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> held thirty days mourning at the affecting providence. "All <HI>Judah</HI> and <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> mourned for <HI>Jo&s;iah,"</HI> at his decea&s;e. "And <HI>Jeremiah</HI> the prophet lamented him." He penned a funeral dirge on the occa&s;ion: "And all the &s;inging men, and &s;inging women, &s;pake of <HI>Jo|&s;iah</HI> in their lamentations, and made them an ordi|nance in <HI>I&s;rael;"</HI> behold, "they are written in the Lamentations."</P>
<P>To weep, is human; is chri&s;tian; is GODLIKE. "JESUS wept." It evidences a tender heart, im|pre&s;&s;ed with pious and virtuous affections. It is an honor to a people to expre&s;s a &s;en&s;e of their lo&s;s of great benefactors in &s;olemn mourning. It &s;hews that they are not barbarous and uncivilized; but enlightened, well informed, benevolent, virtuous. It will get them a name and prai&s;e in the world. And when &s;incerely done, will meet the approbation of Heaven.</P>
<P>Decent mourning for the lo&s;s of worthy charac|racters, is &s;anctioned by divine authority; and tho' it no way affects the dead, it may benefit the living. In cheri&s;hing pious reflections on the Providence, their melting hearts are made more &s;u&s;ceptible of divine impre&s;&s;ions, in exciting humblene&s;s of mind, and &s;e|rious meditations on their own frailty.</P>
<P>If great men, and the mighty are fallen, &s;urely then may we &s;ay, men of low degree are vanity, and
<PB N="14" REF="037989_0014_100F6FF1E5B1D760">
mu&s;t be laid in the du&s;t; al&s;o in attending &s;uch &s;cenes, it may &s;erve to call off our dependence from the creature, the mo&s;t exalted; and place our tru&s;t in GOD, who, only hath immortality. "Put not your tru&s;t in Princes, nor in the &s;on of man, in whom there is no help. His breath goeth forth, he re|turneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts peri&s;h. Happy is he that hath the GOD of <HI>Jacob</HI> for his help; who&s;e hope is in the LORD his GOD."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">146 P&s;alm, 3, 4, 5.</NOTE> Again further, in reflecting upon the re&s;pect &s;hewn to worthy characters, and who have de&s;erved well of their country, it may &s;timulate &s;urvivors to worthy deeds them&s;elves, to go and do likewi&s;e. To be in|fluenced principally by the prai&s;e of men, is too &s;er|vile, and dangerous; yet, a proper degree is ani|mating, and may not be hurtful or en&s;naring; pro|vided a &s;en&s;e of duty, and the honor that cometh from GOD only be uppermo&s;t in the heart.</P>
<P>As the eye affects the heart, funeral proce&s;&s;ions, and outward forms of mourning, may &s;erve to ex|cite tender feelings in the &s;oul. A &s;ort of mechani|cal influence will ari&s;e from a&s;&s;ociating with mourn|ers, and viewing their faces bedewed with unfeigned tears. We <HI>&s;hall</HI> weep, with tho&s;e that weep. Hence, &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions will be made, as cannot be ea&s;ily effaced from the mind, and will tend to excite &s;erious reflections, that may be very u&s;eful in future life.</P>
<P>We honor our decea&s;ed friends, when we imitate their virtues, and follow them &s;o far as they followed CHRIST our divine Redeemer. In this, we &s;hew
<PB N="15" REF="037989_0015_100F6FF367935518">
greater re&s;pect to their memories and e&s;teem for their merits; than by repeated lamentations, clothed in &s;ackcloth, and &s;hedding tears on their graves.&mdash;Though dead, yet &s;peaking, they cry; what&s;oever things are true, hone&s;t, ju&s;t and pure; what&s;oever things are lovely, and of good report; if there be a|ny virtue, if there be any prai&s;e, think on the&s;e things. Similar to this, our father and friend WASHING|TON, when living, coun&s;elled us, and exemplified in his conduct. Among all the honors &s;hewn him at his decea&s;e, &s;hall we deny him that which is the greate&s;t of all? Will we refu&s;e to imitate his vir|tues; his piety, his benevolence, and his public &s;pirit.</P>
<P>In commemorating the lo&s;s of great and u&s;eful men, &s;uch as the late beloved General WASH|INGTON; while we give honor to whom honor is due, we are better in&s;tructed, than to u&s;e &s;ervile adulation, like &s;laves, who live on the breath of their Lords; or like the heathen, who deified their heroes and revered them as Gods. Doubtle&s;s many of the heathen gods originated from the people, extolling the characters of their generals and emperors to an exce&s;&s;ive height, and placing them above the &s;tars.</P>
<P>But our religion teaches us, that there is but one GOD, &s;upreme over all. That all gifts and accom|pli&s;hments are derived from him; and tho&s;e who are furni&s;hed with them, &s;hould be honored for God's &s;ake, who&s;e &s;ervants they are; &s;hould be hon|ored for their <HI>own</HI> &s;akes, when improving and u&s;ing

their talents well; and the remov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> of them by death, &s;hould be &s;incerely lamented for <HI>our own</HI> &s;akes, that we are deprived of &s;o great a ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>"A Prince and great man is fallen this day," in our I&s;rael. "The LORD hath taken away the mighty man, and the man of war, and the Judge, and the prudent and antient. But let us not mourn as tho&s;e that have no hope; but tru&s;t in the LORD who hath the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the &s;pirit, to rai&s;e up in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to pre&s;ide and rule over us, as &s;hall fear GOD and work righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>As the &s;ons of the Prophets &s;aid, "the &s;pirit of <HI>Elijah</HI> doth re&s;t on <HI>Eli&s;ha."</HI> Thanks be to GOD, that &s;uch an happy portion of the &s;pirit of our de|cea&s;ed <HI>General,</HI> and late <HI>Pre&s;ident,</HI> doth re&s;t on his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, who is now the &s;upreme magi&s;trate of the <HI>Union.</HI> The LORD ble&s;s him!</P>
<P>Though we are bereaved of one who was a <HI>Father</HI> to the country, and many years our political head, yet our GOD liveth, and ble&s;&s;ed be his name. Let us by a pious conduct &s;ecure his favor and ble&s;&s;ing. Our Redeemer liveth forever more. Let us &s;ubmit to him as the Captain of our Salvation; as the Leader and Commander of the People. Let us be <HI>his</HI> pious, humble, and peaceable &s;ubjects; who is the Prince of peace. Let us be good &s;oldiers of JE|SUS CHRIST; fight under his banner the good fight of faith; then he will lead us on to Glory; where death will be &s;wallowed up in victory; immortal honors crown our Heads, and ineffable felicity re|joice our Hearts.</P>
