<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>BRETHREN, AND FELLOW-CITIZENS:</HI>&mdash;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS day is rendered illu&s;trious in the annals of our country, by giving birth to a citizen, whom it has plea&s;ed GOD to honor with di&s;tingui&s;h|ed honors, and to render uncommonly acceptable to the multitude of his brethren.</P>
<P>The early pre&s;ages, which he gave of martial bra|very, &s;kill, and prudence, have been more than an|&s;wered, in his &s;ucce&s;sfully leading the armies of his country to repel her aggre&s;&s;ors, &s;ecure her rights, and e&s;tabli&s;h her in the enjoyment of peace and independence. The country that he defended, at the head of a band of heroes, he re&s;cued from confu&s;ion and imbecility, at the head of a band of patriots, by conciliating their affections, and com|bining their intere&s;ts, in a con&s;titution of govern|ment, which, in its operation, has ju&s;tified the eulo|gies of &s;peculation, and rendered our country, probably, the free&s;t and happie&s;t in the world.
<PB N="6" REF="037063_0004_100C3FA8443894E8">
Nobly dive&s;ting him&s;elf of all civil or military di&s;|tinction, he retired to the walks of private life, ob|taining a triumph in &s;elf conque&s;t, that few mortals have obtained. But the unanimous &s;uffrages of his country drew him, reluctant, from his retreat, and placed him at the head of the admini&s;tration of our government. In this novel &s;tation, during an eight years pre&s;idency, at an epoch, mo&s;t momen|tous to America, in its foreign relations and inter|nal intere&s;ts, he proved him&s;elf the wi&s;e politician, the di&s;cerning, firm, and di&s;intere&s;ted patriot, the inviolable friend of his country, and guardian of her rights.</P>
<P>National gratitude and affection have for &s;everal years influenced the citizens of America to di&s;tin|gui&s;h the birth-day of &s;o illu&s;trious a Benefactor, by fe&s;tive celebrations and &s;entimental tributary ac|knowledgments. But, alas! this mode of celebra|tion is no more! Neither dignity nor u&s;efulne&s;s exempt from death. The Sovereign LORD of life, a few weeks &s;ince, &s;ummoned from his intercour&s;e with mortals, this Father of his country, our &s;hield in war, our pride in peace.</P>
<P>The &s;upreme council of our nation, in token of re&s;pect to the memory of the decea&s;ed, and to quick|en our attention to the voice of Providence, have &s;eperated this anniver&s;ary to national mourning,
<PB N="7" REF="037063_0005_100C3FAAE5348170">
and devotion. In obedience to their &s;ummons, we are a&s;&s;embled to mingle our tears and condolence, to humble our&s;elves at the feet of unerring wi&s;dom and righteou&s;ne&s;s, to unite our &s;upplications and thank&s;givings to him who gives and who takes away, earne&s;tly begging that the hand that has broken, would bind us up, and cau&s;e a harve&s;t of national ble&s;&s;ings to ari&s;e from a nation's tears.</P>
<P>I have &s;incerely hoped that &s;ome municipal ar|rangement would have excu&s;ed me from a part in this day's exerci&s;es; that we &s;hould have been favor|ed with the efforts of other talents; this I have the rather hoped, as I have already mingled my mite with the offerings of the rich, which the partiality of friends has drawn from its ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>In contemplating the duties of the day, I have been utterly at a lo&s;s as to what would be proper or expedient. The voluntary tributes of re&s;pect, that have flowed from the highe&s;t &s;ources, have left &s;carce any thing to be added on this anniver&s;ary; 'and what can the man do that comes after the king.' My fir&s;t re&s;olution was only to have read on this oc|ca&s;ion, that admirable addre&s;s of our late worthy Pre&s;ident, poured forth with &s;uch parental affection and &s;olicitude, in the dignified attitude of di&s;robing him&s;elf of the in&s;ignia of office, and retiring to the
<PB N="8" REF="037063_0006_100C3FACD8F83640">
rank of a private citizen. My re&s;olution is changed, not from an apprehen&s;ion that any thing can be offered you &s;o worthy your attention, but from the reflection that this is already in the hands of mo&s;t, and will be peru&s;ed and reperu&s;ed, with lei&s;urly at|tention, while a &s;park of enlightened patrioti&s;m warms our bo&s;oms. Relying upon your u&s;ual, can|did and patient attention, I have concluded to attempt an illu&s;tration of a &s;ubject at all times intere&s;ting, at the pre&s;ent, peculiarly &s;o.</P>
<P><HI>That Religion and Righteou&s;ne&s;s are the Ba&s;is of National Honor and Pro&s;perity, and the &s;ure&s;t mean of National Security and Peace.</HI> Will &s;uch a &s;ubject, be deemed altogether foreign to the de&s;ign of the day? It harmonizes with the principles, &s;pirit, and letter, of our invaluable political legacy; and if our decea&s;ed patron retains a wi&s;h for his country, I doubt not it is, that it would di&s;tingui&s;h it&s;elf as much by its piety and righteou&s;ne&s;s, as it has been di&s;tingui&s;hed by the favor and benediction of hea|ven. For he now perfectly knows what, while liv|ing, he &s;ublimely taught, That "OF ALL THE DISPOSITIONS AND HABITS WHICH LEAD TO POLITICAL PROSPERITY, RELIGION AND MO|RALITY, ARE INDISPENSABLE SUPPORTS."</P>
<P>The portion of &s;cripture &s;elected as the theme of our di&s;cour&s;e, is a part of the charge of
<PB N="9" REF="037063_0007_100C3FAF05270010">
Mo&s;es, that venerable patriot, and leader of the children of I&s;rael; when he viewed his di&s;&s;olution at hand, and would make every effort to &s;ecure to the people whom he loved, national honor and happi|ne&s;s. The words you will read</P>
<Q><BIBL>DEUTERONOMY, IV. 6.</BIBL>
Keep therefore and do them, for this is your wi&s;dom and your under&s;tanding in the fight of the nations which &s;hall hear all the&s;e &s;tatutes, and &s;ay, &s;urely this great nation is a wi&s;e and under&s;tanding people.</Q>
<P>THE &s;triking re&s;emblance, in a great variety of particulars, between this renowned leader of I&s;rael and the venerated character who&s;e lo&s;s we this day deplore, has been happily made the &s;ubject of tri|butary re&s;pect to the memory of the latter.</P>
<P>In nothing, does there appear a more &s;triking re|&s;emblance, than in the di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of their pat|rioti&s;m, and their concern that the people of their charge &s;hould be pro&s;perous and happy after their de|cea&s;e. The illu&s;ions of fancy and affection a&s;ide, the palm mu&s;t be given to Mo&s;es in every re&s;pect, for he had &s;upernatural intercour&s;e with Heaven, was cloth|ed with commi&s;&s;ion and power from on high, and on trying emergencies had &s;en&s;ible te&s;timonies and aid from GOD. But if our beloved WASHINGTON, from &s;imilarity of circum&s;tances, was lead to make this Jewi&s;h leader his pattern, he has been a mo&s;t hon|orable and dignified copyi&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="037063_0008_100C3FB08BA2AB10">
When Mo&s;es perceived his di&s;&s;olution at hand, he &s;ummoned the tribes of I&s;rael around him, and addre&s;&s;es them upon their national hopes and pro&s;|pects&mdash;gives a general &s;ummary of their hi&s;tory &s;ince they came out of Egypt, repeats the &s;tatutes and judgments that GOD had given, charging them to keep and do them if they would be wi&s;e, re&s;|pectable, or happy. If the terms u&s;ed by this Jew|i&s;h Legi&s;lator are not perfectly &s;ynonimous, &s;tatutes may refer to their religious obligations, and judg|ments to their civil and political, in the &s;acred ob|&s;ervance of which they &s;hould &s;ecure pro&s;perity at home, and renown abroad among the nations. <HI>For Religion and Righteou&s;ne&s;s are the &s;ure&s;t Ba&s;is of Na|tional Honor and Pro&s;perity, and the direct means of Tranquillity and Peace.</HI></P>
<P>To national honor and glory, a due proportion of eminent talents, and of laudible acquirments in knowledge and virtue, are nece&s;&s;ary. And they will excel, who have the mo&s;t brilliant talents, happily united to mo&s;t un&s;ophi&s;ticated integrity. Though men's talents are not originally of their own choo&s;|ing, yet what they are to &s;ociety, is generally the re|&s;ult of education.</P>
<P>If there were no object of religion, and no moral government exerci&s;ed over the world, yet the im|pre&s;&s;ions and effects produced upon the human mind
<PB N="11" REF="037063_0009_100C3FB231EB0D80">
and heart, by the belief and contemplation of infin|ite perfection, have a natural, and almo&s;t mechanic tendency, to form the human character to great and noble conceptions, and to &s;timulate to worthy ac|tions and achievements. The mind in contemplat|ing elevated and enlarged objects, is, from principles in&s;eperable from our nature, it&s;elf elevated and en|larged. The univer&s;e of being affords no object worthy to be compared, in elevation and dignity, with him who&s;e name alone is JEHOVAH, and the only object of religious homage. The exerci&s;es and affections which the due contemplation of his ado|rable perfections, excite, &s;trengthen and invigorate the faculties of the man, repre&s;s and regulate the di&s;orderly propen&s;ities, and form a ba&s;is for di&s;tin|gui&s;hed mental and bodily exertions.</P>
<P>If to a &s;peculative belief of the exi&s;tence of a GOD, be added a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of a &s;tate of friend&s;hip and reconciliation with him, and of intere&s;t in his per|fections, the force of motive to virtuous deeds, and of re&s;traint from vicious ones, is complete. What &s;acrifices have been made, what dangers have been hazarded, what feats of valor have been achieved, for the benefit of nations, in the belief of the approving &s;miles of heaven, and in the hope of rewards which GOD only can be&s;tow? That in the nature of things, religion, as it con&s;i&s;ts in the belief of a GOD, and in exerci&s;es and affections that &s;uch a belief excites,
<PB N="12" REF="037063_0010_100C3FB58EB146B8">
forms in&s;truments of national honor and pro&s;perity, and is calculated to &s;ecure tho&s;e objects &s;o intere&s;t|ing and important to any people. And on the con|trary, the &s;entence of an in&s;pired pen upon the gro&s;&s;|er &s;en&s;ual indulgencies, is, in its mea&s;ure, true of every &s;pecies and degree of impiety and immorality, 'They take away the heart.' They enervate and unman the body. They effeminate and deba&s;e the mind. They bring on premature decrepitude and death. In the vortex of &s;en&s;uality, luxury, and im|piety, mo&s;t nations have fir&s;t ingulphed their nation|al honor, &s;trength, and valor; and then their na|tional exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>The natural tendency of religion to promote the honor and pro&s;perity of a people, and to &s;ecure their peace and tranquility, receives infinite occa&s;ion by its &s;ecuring to them the &s;upernatural influence and benediction of heaven.</P>
<P>Whatever attempts have been, or may be made, to obliterate a &s;en&s;e of Deity, or efface impre&s;&s;ions of his exi&s;tence from the human mind, the proofs of his exi&s;tence are, and ever will be, as numerous as the creatures that exi&s;t. "The invi&s;ible things of him, from the creation of the world, are clearly &s;een, being under&s;tood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and God-head." God's providen|tial in&s;pection and government are the nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ult of his exi&s;tence and perfections; which gov|ernment
<PB N="13" REF="037063_0011_100C3FB715E210E8">
mu&s;t be accommodated to the nature and capacities of its re&s;pective objects. As man is a ra|tional and moral agent, the providential government of GOD, as it re&s;pects man, mu&s;t be of the moral kind. And as nations exi&s;t, in their &s;ocial and na|tional capacities, only in this world, &s;o the di&s;pen&s;a|tions of heaven towards them will be influenced by their religious and moral character and conduct. "Tho&s;e, who honor GOD, he will honor, but tho&s;e who de&s;pi&s;e him, he will lightly e&s;teem." The pre|valence of virtue, piety, and righteou&s;ne&s;s, in a na|tion, &s;ecure the favor of him, who&s;e it is to build and to plant, who&s;e it is to make great, and give &s;trength unto all. His favor is life to a nation, no le&s;s than to an individual, and his loving kindne&s;s is the &s;ource of their honor, pro&s;perity, and peace. "They, whom he ble&s;&s;es, are ble&s;&s;ed;" and none can di&s;annul it. They, upon whom he frowns, mu&s;t wither; for none can arre&s;t, or divert the effects of his di&s;plea&s;ure. So ju&s;t and natural are the&s;e deductions and conclu&s;ions of rea&s;on, that a mo&s;t eminent, correct and judicious writer has thought it proper to put the following expre&s;&s;ions into the lips of a heathen: "If there's a power above us, and that there is, all nature cries aloud in all her works. He mu&s;t delight in virtue, and that which he delights in, mu&s;t be happy."</P>
<P>But &s;hould a doubt remain, re&s;pecting the cor|rectne&s;s of the&s;e conclu&s;ions, it mu&s;t be wholly re|moved
<PB N="14" REF="037063_0012_100C3FB923105950">
by explicit declarations from the &s;ource of unerring truth, of which innumerable might be adduced, &s;imilar to the&s;e: "The eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open to their cry; but the face of the Lord is again&s;t them that do evil." "Righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a nation; but &s;in is the reproach of any people." Nay JEHO|VAH him&s;elf has conde&s;cended to publi&s;h to us the rule of his admini&s;tration towards nations. By the prophet Jeremiah, we hear him &s;aying. "At what in&s;tant I &s;hall &s;peak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, to pull down, and to de&s;troy, if that nation again&s;t whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them. And at what in&s;tant I &s;hall &s;peak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it, if it do evil in my &s;ight, that it obey not my voice, I will repent of the good wherewith I &s;aid I would benefit them." If this rule of admini&s;tration was more appropriate to the nation to whom GOD gave his oracles direct, yet the terms in which it is ex|pre&s;&s;ed forbid our confining it to them, and the hi&s;tory of GOD'S dealings with the nations of the earth; &s;o far as it can be collected from authentic data, ju&s;tifies its univer&s;al application.</P>
<P>In the hi&s;tory of GOD'S ancient people, flowing from an in&s;pired &s;ource, we find a &s;crupulous ob|&s;ervance
<PB N="15" REF="037063_0013_100C3FBAAABDD560">
of this rule. While they regarded the laws, &s;tatutes, and ordinances of the Lord, "He &s;uffered no man to harm them, yea, he reproved Kings for their &s;akes; &s;aying touch not mine annointed, and do my Prophets no harm." "He gave them re&s;t on every &s;ide, made them to ride up|on the high places of the earth; he fed them with the fine&s;t of the wheat, and cau&s;ed them to abound with all rich trea&s;ure." Their renown went forth among other nations, and di&s;po&s;ed them to &s;ay, "What nation is &s;o great, that hath GOD &s;o nigh them." "What nation is &s;o great, that hath &s;tatutes and judgments &s;o righteous." But on the other hand, when they for&s;ook GOD, and bowed down to idols; when they di&s;regarded his &s;tatutes, tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed his commandments, and neglected his ordinances, wild and portentous clouds darkened their political hemi&s;phere, their &s;trength withered, the neighboring nations exacted upon them, and the &s;word, the famine, or the pe&s;tilence be&s;poke the di&s;plea&s;ure of heaven, and called upon them to con|&s;ider from whence they had fallen, to repent, and return to the LORD. No part of the Jewi&s;h hi&s;to|ry, in any period of their exi&s;tence, is de&s;titute of illu&s;trations of the&s;e remarks: But the times of the Judges afford the mo&s;t &s;triking comment upon the words of our text, and the fulle&s;t confirmation of the truth of our propo&s;ition: That religion and righteou&s;ne&s;s are the &s;ure&s;t ba&s;is of national honor and pro&s;perity, and the direct means of tranquility and peace.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="037063_0014_100C3FBD882F8520">
Happy would it be for every nation, who, to the law that was given by Mo&s;es, have &s;uperadded the grace and truth that came by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to revive an attention to this &s;ubject, and regard the charge of this renowned leader of I&s;rael, to the people, who were to him dear as his own &s;oul. Thrice hap|py would it be for the people of this land, who in various re&s;pects re&s;emble GOD'S ancient I&s;rael, over whom the arm of power and mercy has been mar|vellou&s;ly di&s;played, to harmonize their views, &s;enti|ments, and feelings in an enlightened belief, and &s;acred regard of this in&s;pired charge, this incontro|vertible maxim of &s;ound policy.</P>
<P>An unplea&s;ant diver&s;ity of &s;entiment and differ|ence of opinion have ari&s;en in this country re&s;pect|ing the line of political conduct, mo&s;t directly tend|ing to &s;ecure our national honor, pro&s;perity, and peace. National antipathy, and pa&s;&s;ionate national attachment have doubtle&s;s had their influence in originating and cheri&s;hing this &s;tate of public &s;enti|ment, the principal ground of hope to our enemies, of fear and anxiety to the di&s;intere&s;ted patriot; which, the di&s;cerning eye of our revered Pre&s;ident fore&s;ee|ing, his faithful tongue hath thus addre&s;&s;ed us. "Inveterate antipathies again&s;t particular nations, and pa&s;&s;ionate attachments for others, &s;hould be ex|cluded; and in the place of them ju&s;t and amicable feelings towards all &s;hould be cultivated. The na|tion, which indulges towards another an habitual
<PB N="17" REF="037063_0015_100C3FBF0E45D2E8">
hatred, or an habitual fondne&s;s, is in &s;ome degree, a &s;lave. It is a &s;lave to its animo&s;ity or affection, either of which is &s;ufficient to lead it a&s;tray from its duty and its intere&s;t." Upon which &s;ubject our de|parted &s;age continues to di&s;cour&s;e in &s;entiments and expre&s;&s;ions which de&s;erve to be indelibly in|graven on all our memories. While not perfectly harmonious in our views and apprehen&s;ions, which in this &s;tate of imperfection, is hardly to be ex|pected.</P>
<P>It is a plea&s;ing and promi&s;ing con&s;ideration that the advocates of the re&s;pective opinions equally pro|fe&s;s to be warmed by the fire of patrioti&s;m, to be animated by a love to their country, and a de&s;ire to &s;ecure and promote its be&s;t intere&s;t. If this be &s;o, the unhappy divi&s;ion is only the re&s;ult of the pow|er of &s;uch prejudices as are con&s;i&s;tent with integri|ty, and which time and reflection, candor and con|de&s;cen&s;ion will remove.</P>
<P>But however accurate our &s;entiments, or ju&s;t our views, re&s;pecting the line of political conduct that this country ought to pur&s;ue, it is a truth, &s;anction|ed by experience, and confirmed by the voice of GOD, that it is only by combining with them reli|gion and righteou&s;ne&s;s, a &s;acred regard to GOD and his authority, that we &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed, and pre|&s;erve our name and prai&s;e among the nations of the earth: In contempt or neglect of the&s;e, no line of
<PB N="18" REF="037063_0016_100C3FC124E528F0">
policy, can procure for us, or &s;ecure to us, the ne|ce&s;&s;ary requi&s;ites to national pro&s;perity and glory. How accurately, upon this &s;ubject, thought and &s;pake our beloved WASHINGTON. "Of all the di&s;po&s;itions and habits which lead to political pro&s;|perity, religion and morality are indi&s;pen&s;able &s;up|ports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patrioti&s;m, who would labor to &s;ubvert the&s;e great pillars of human happine&s;s, the&s;e firme&s;t props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to re&s;pect and cheri&s;h them. A volume could not trace all their connections with public and private felicity.&mdash;And let us with caution indulge the &s;uppo&s;ition, that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of re|fined education, on minds of a peculiar &s;tructure; rea&s;on and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail, in exclu&s;ion of religi|ous principles."</P>
<P>"It is &s;ub&s;tantially true that virtue or morality is a nece&s;&s;ary &s;pring of popular government. The rule indeed extends with more or le&s;s force to every &s;pecies of free government. Who that is a friend to it can look with indifference upon attempts to &s;hake the foundation of the fabric."</P>
<P>If then our bo&s;oms glow with the ardor of pa|trioti&s;m, if we are animated by a love of our coun|try,
<PB N="19" REF="037063_0017_100C3FC2CB955CD0">
and a &s;incere de&s;ire to promote her pro&s;perity and glory&mdash;let us lo&s;e all party feuds, animo&s;ities, and contentions, in a con&s;cientious veneration of the great object of wor&s;hip, and an exemplary ob&s;erv|ance of all his precepts, and let the only conte&s;t among the enlightened citizens of America be, who &s;hall excel in rational piety and exemplary vir|tue, and &s;o rival his competitors in exalted pa|trioti&s;m. "They who thus honor GOD, he will honor". "The meek he will guide in judgment, the meek he will teach his way."

<P>A vicious, wicked and unprincipled man, who ca&s;ts off the fear of GOD, and ridicules the obliga|tions of religion and righteou&s;ne&s;s, though he may rejoice in national pro&s;perity and peace, roils the fountain head of their exi&s;tence, and poi&s;ons the channel through which they are conveyed. The pious fearers of GOD and workers of righteou&s;ne&s;s are the chariots of a nation and the hor&s;emen there|of. The piety of Jo&s;eph in the hou&s;e of Potipher, and in the court of Pharaoh, procured to that fami|ly and nation a train of providential ble&s;&s;ings. The impiety of Mana&s;&s;eh pulled down upon the nation of I&s;rael tokens of divine di&s;plea&s;ure for &s;everal gen|erations. Had there been but ten righteous per&s;ons in the land of Sodom, for their &s;ake its awful de|&s;truction would have been averted.</P>

While the&s;e remarks apply to all nations of the earth, they have a &s;pecial empha&s;is and energy with reference to our own. The manner in which Ame|rica was &s;ettled; the character, principles and views of our ance&s;tors, impo&s;e upon us &s;pecial obligations to regard the &s;tatutes and judgments of GOD. The purity in which GOD has pre&s;erved his revealed religion to us, the exten&s;ive religious, as well as civil privileges that he has indulged us; the re|markable an&s;wers of prayer that he has given to his people in their exigencies, and manife&s;tations of his power in their mounts of difficulty, would greatly aggravate their guilt, &s;hould they turn from the Lord, and de&s;pi&s;e his ordinances: and our folly as well as guilt would be without a parellel, if, with the in&s;tructive admonition of the effects of infidelity up|on the nations of Europe before our eyes, we &s;hould ru&s;h head-long in the career, which has pulled down &s;uch accumulated vengeance on their heads.</P>
<P>A &s;pirit of infidelity, di&s;played in a &s;tudied en|deavour to loo&s;en and di&s;&s;olve the obligations of re|vealed religion, has long infected the nations of Europe, originating probably in high &s;tation, it has de&s;cended through every grade, and has more or le&s;s leavened the whole lump. If &s;ome nations have been more active or zealous in the attempt, yet, according to the deci&s;ion of the Savior in anoth|er ca&s;e, no one in this could have a face to ca&s;t a

&s;tone at his neighbour. Had we an in&s;pired hi&s;to|rian, who, while relating and de&s;cribing events as they have ari&s;en, could al&s;o declare the &s;ecret moral and remote cau&s;es of them. I doubt not, we &s;hould hear him addre&s;&s;ing the nations of Europe, under the awful calamities that threaten their exi&s;tence, in language like this "Have you not procured th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e things unto your&s;elves, in that you have for&s;aken the LORD your GOD, and have de&s;pi&s;ed his &s;tatutes and contemned his ordinances, your own wickedne&s;s corrects you, and your back&s;lidings reprove you; know therefore and &s;ee that it is an evil thing and bitter that you have for&s;aken the LORD your GOD."</P>
<P>While we &s;ee little attempt in national humilia|tions, penitence, or reformations to remove the cau&s;e of the LORD'S controver&s;y, we may ju&s;tly tremble at the probable i&s;&s;ue, for when GOD contendeth, he will overcome. Nor is their any coun&s;el, under|&s;tanding or might, again&s;t the LORD. But we &s;hould be more anxiou&s;ly concerned, and feelingly alive to prevent or remove a &s;imilar cau&s;e of divine controver&s;y with our&s;elves.</P>
<P>The &s;eeds of infidelity have been long &s;cattered in our country, a variety of cau&s;es have con&s;pired, within a few years pa&s;t, to manure and cheri&s;h them, and they have &s;prung up and &s;pread with threaten|ing a&s;pect. No longer confined to the retreats of

&s;peculation, nor to the amu&s;ement, of the di&s;puta|tious circle; the principles have infected almo&s;t every rank, and &s;hed a baneful practical influence. But with &s;o &s;olemn an example as the dreadful &s;tate of Europe before our eyes; and with &s;uch re|peated tokens of GOD'S di&s;plea&s;ure in pe&s;tilential de&s;olations, heightened by the late &s;udden removal of eminent characters; &s;hall we not receive warning? &s;hall we not be awakened to con&s;ideration, be ex|cited to return from whence we have apo&s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;ed, and recover the pri&s;tine American veneration for GOD and his government, and practical regard to that glorious &s;y&s;tem of truth and duty which he hath given and pre&s;erved to us? This would be our wi&s;|dom and under&s;tanding, this would be the means of our renown among the nations of the earth; and, what is more, it would &s;ecure to our ri&s;ing Republic, the guiding care, and protecting benediction of him who&s;e it is to make great and give &s;trength unto all.</P>
<P>May we not be encouraged to this duty by the fond, and, I would flatter my&s;elf, not enthu&s;ia&s;tic hope, that GOD de&s;igns America as the happy in|&s;trument of &s;upporting his banner again&s;t the flood of infidelity that has deluged &s;o great a part of the civilized world.

to her religious, as well as political intere&s;ts, give rational ground for this hope? Is it not &s;trengthened by the reflection, that GOD re&s;erved an a&s;ylum here for rational and con&s;titutional liberty. He honored and &s;ucceeded the bold at|tempt of freemen to &s;ecure their rights in a govern|ment of laws of their own making, admini&s;tered by men of their own choo&s;ing, and will GOD &s;uffer the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential prop of &s;uch a government &s;o &s;oon to fail? Without a prevalence of virtue, republics cannot exi&s;t; without religion, virtue cannot pre|vail; and no religion affords &s;o firm a ba&s;is, or ex|hibits &s;uch animating motives, to the prevalence of virtue as that which brings life and immortality to light, and holds forth rewards and puni&s;hments &s;tamped with eternity. If we retain any reverence for revelation, we mu&s;t believe that GOD will pre|&s;erve his Church in the world. He may remove it from one place, but it &s;hall &s;ettle in another. The gates of hell &s;hall not prevail again&s;t it. "The Kings of the earth may &s;et them&s;elves and the rulers take coun&s;el together, again&s;t the LORD and again&s;t his anointed, they may, pre&s;umptuou&s;ly &s;ay, "Let us break their bands a&s;under and ca&s;t away their cords from us:" but in the inimitable language of &s;cripture, "He that &s;itteth in the heavens will laugh, the LORD &s;hall have them in deri&s;ion; then &s;hall he &s;peak to them in his wrath, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ex them in his &s;ore di&s;plea&s;ure.

<P>Let it not then be thought a vain repetition, if I again exhort my enlightened and reflecting fellow-citizens, to &s;often all their unplea&s;ant feelings, and embo&s;om all their party views in a united veneration for GOD and his government; and in a con&s;cien|cious and exemplary ob&s;ervance of his laws and in&s;titutions. Thus &s;hall we prove, that though we are men, and liable to err under the impre&s;&s;ions to which humanity is &s;ubject, yet we are indeed the friends of our country, and would do every thing in our power to &s;ecure to it the &s;hield and benediction of him, "who can make a little one to become a thou&s;and, and a &s;mall one a &s;trong nation."</P>
<P>If then there is any confidence to be placed in the deductions of rea&s;on, or any credit to be given to the declarations of &s;cripture: We learn, from this &s;ubject, who are the true friends of any country, and the mean of &s;ecuring to it national honor and pro&s;|perity. They are tho&s;e who, rationally and devout|ly, reverence, adore, and fear GOD, who keep his righteous judgments, and con&s;cienciou&s;ly walk in

his &s;tatutes and ordinances. I would not be under|&s;tood to in&s;inuate that men void of religious princi|ple; and even contemners of religious duties, may not have an attachment to their country, and a de|&s;ire for its civil and political pro&s;perity and glory; nay, they may expo&s;e them&s;elves to great dangers, and make great &s;acrifices to accompli&s;h the&s;e ob|jects. But by their impiety and profanene&s;s they weaken the energy of tho&s;e in&s;piring principles that &s;erve to ennoble, invigorate, and enlarge the mind, and introduce practices that enervate and corrupt. They take away the heavenly defence and &s;ecurity of a people, and render it nece&s;&s;ary for him who ruleth among the nations by righteous things in judgment, to te&s;tify his di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t tho&s;e that de&s;pi&s;e his laws and contemn his ordinances. One &s;inner de&s;troys much good, and may be the occa&s;ion of incalculable evil. In the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the world Fleets and Armies are a nece&s;&s;ary mean of &s;ecurity and defence; but they will eventually prove a broken reed to the nation that de&s;pi&s;es the GOD of armies, and pours contempt upon his authority. "There is no coun&s;el, under&s;tanding or might a|gain&s;t the LORD." He can di&s;appoint the be&s;t con|certed plans of the wi&s;e Ahithophels, and &s;hroud their flattering pro&s;pects, in wild confu&s;ion. The true fearer of GOD, and worker of righteou&s;ne&s;s is the friend of his country and the mean of her de|fence, and when &s;uch is the character of the rul|ers

<P>This &s;ubject directs the hone&s;t, independent, and patriotic citizen, in the exerci&s;e of his high birth-right as a freeman, in giving his &s;uffrages for civil rulers. This, though a natural right of man, is enjoyed but by a very &s;mall proportion of our race. They, who are dignified by the high privilege, ought to honor them&s;elves by a dignified exerci&s;e of it, and not carele&s;sly de&s;pi&s;e their birth-right, much le&s;s &s;ell it, at a le&s;s premium, than a me&s;s of pottage, to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of pride, or pa&s;&s;ion; of envy or ambition.</P>
<P>The character of a nation is ju&s;tly decided by the character of their rulers, e&s;pecially in a free and e|lective government. And they have a mighty in|fluence in confirming or changing the character of a people. If the rulers of a people are men of prin|ciple, who fear GOD and ob&s;erve his &s;tatutes, the na|tion will be owned in this approving light by him who &s;uperintends the affairs of nations, and it will give a train to his providential di&s;pen&s;ations. Ev|ery friend to his country, in the choice of civil rul|ers, ought to have his eye upon the faithful of the land, upon &s;uch as fear GOD and regard his &s;tatutes. It is to be expected, other things being equal, that we &s;hould give our &s;uffrages for men, who&s;e political

<P>Jethro's advice can never be controverted in prin|ciple, nor di&s;regarded in practice with impunity, "choo&s;e out from among all the people able men, men of truth, &s;uch as fear GOD and hate coveteou&s;|ne&s;s,"&mdash;and to them confide the admini&s;tration of your affairs.</P>
<P>Our Con&s;titutions of Government have happily formed no religious e&s;tabli&s;hments, nor excluded any man of honorable integrity, from office; yet by their invariably in&s;tituting oaths as introductory to offices and qualifications for them.
