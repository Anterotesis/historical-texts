<P>And the children of I&s;rael wept for Mo&s;es in the plains of Moab thirty days.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>BEMOANING the lo&s;s of friends and benefactors&mdash;the lo&s;s of the deliverers and protectors of our nation and land, is both decent in it&s;elf, and warranted by &s;cripture example.</P>
<P>IT has ever been the practice, time immemorial, whenever a prince, prince&s;s, or per&s;ons, who had been friends and benefactors to the nation, or &s;ocie|ty to which they belonged, were removed by death, for the &s;urvivors to con&s;ecrate &s;ome time to lament, and to put on tokens of mourning. This practice we find ob&s;erved, not only by the heathen world, but al&s;o by the mo&s;t pious, and godly. For when <HI>Sarah</HI> was dead, who&s;e name &s;ignifies a prince&s;s, or a high mother, <HI>Abraham came to Hebron to mourn for her.</HI> When Jacob yielded up the gho&s;t, the Egyptians had &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of their lo&s;s, (and well they might,
<PB N="6" REF="037962_0005_10102DC622E4A5D0">
for Jacob was the father of him, who had been their &s;alvation under God in the time of famine, and an interce&s;&s;or with God for them) <HI>they,</HI> I &s;ay, <HI>made a mourning for him three&s;core and ten days. Jo&s;eph made a mourning for his father &s;even days.</HI> When Aaron was dead, <HI>they mourned for him thirty days, even all the hou&s;e of I&s;rael. They wept for Mo&s;es in the plains of Mo|ab thirty days.</HI> Though they were on a journey, and a toil&s;ome one too, and had not arrived to their &s;et|tled habitation; yet, they thought no time lo&s;t to pay &s;ome re&s;pect to tho&s;e worthies. When David received the tidings of Jonathan's death, who was a valiant and friendly man, he &s;ays, <HI>I am di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very plea&s;ant ha&s;t thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, pa&s;&s;ing the love of women.</HI> When Jo&s;iah, king of Judah, was &s;lain, the good prophet <HI>Jeremiah lamented him; and all the &s;inging men and &s;inging women &s;pake of Jo&s;iah in their lamenta|tions;</HI> they felt the &s;troke; they were &s;en&s;ible of their great lo&s;s. When our ble&s;&s;ed Lord came to the grave of Lazarus, <HI>he wept;</HI> a good man had fal|len; the little flock of Chri&s;t, then in the world, was deprived <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> one of its precious members. He, who needed no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> prai&s;es of angels, or of men, to add any thing to him, &s;hed tears. <HI>Devout men car|ried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.</HI></P>
<P>IF pious and good men, heathen and &s;aint, have lamented the lo&s;s of their friends and benefactors; and even the Lord from heaven! Shall we be want|ing? Shall we be backward? Shall we refu&s;e to fol|low the example of the Lord of heaven and earth, the example of the pious and godly in all ages? Shall we demean our&s;elv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> below heathens and pa|gans? Yea, more bruti&s;h than the bea&s;ts which per|i&s;h?

<HI>Be a&s;toni&s;hed, O ye heavens! at this, and horribly afraid, O earth! God forbid.</HI> Surely, rea&s;on we have to lament, this day, the lo&s;s of him, who, under God, wrought our deliverance, and e&s;tabli&s;hed our peace, in the happy enjoyment of our rights.</P>
<P>IN pur&s;uing our di&s;cour&s;e, we &s;hall notice two things.</P>

<ITEM>II. Such a lo&s;s calls for great lamentation.</ITEM>

<P N="1">I. The lo&s;s we &s;u&s;tain.</P>
<P>IT is not my de&s;ign, nor is it in my power, to give you a particular biographical hi&s;tory of the man, the lo&s;s of whom, we are reque&s;ted to deplore this day. A number of able men have handed to us &s;ome things re&s;pecting his excellent abilities and charac|ter; no doubt, but we &s;hall have a more full and complete hi&s;tory of the man. But from what hath been &s;aid, and from the experience of many of us, we mu&s;t be convinced, that a great and good man hath fallen. No two characters did ever more coin|cide, than Mo&s;es' and WASHINGTON's. To draw their coincidences in character and fortune, a wor|thy divine of late hath done it, and now in print; therefore, it is needle&s;s for me, in particular, to de|lineate, or to &s;ay all that might be &s;aid of the man. Yet, however, in order to know in &s;ome mea&s;ure our lo&s;s, it is nece&s;&s;ary that we have &s;ome acquaint|ance with his excellent abilities and qualifications.</P>
<P>PERHAPS very few, if any, ever exceeded him in every point. He was favored with as great abilities, and with as good qualifications, as any that have been in the world; the meekne&s;s of Mo&s;es, the up|rightne&s;s and patience of Job, the wi&s;dom of Solo|mon,
<PB N="8" REF="037962_0007_10102DCAD9CA5B20">
and the re&s;olution of Nehemiah; all the&s;e centered in WASHINGTON. <HI>When he was reviled, he reviled not again.</HI> He was patient under fatigue and want, and made but few complaints. He was politic in his plans, and wi&s;e in the execution of them. He was re&s;olute in oppo&s;ing the <HI>Jannes</HI> and <HI>Jambres,</HI> the <HI>Sanballats,</HI> the <HI>Tobiahs,</HI> and <HI>Ge&s;hems</HI> of America, both foreign and dome&s;tic. He ever had the character of <HI>faithful and true;</HI> an eminent Gen|eral, <HI>a man of war from his youth</HI>; yet; not delighting in human blood; but in ju&s;tice and in defending the rights of mankind; a father to his country, and the deliverer of it from <HI>the paw of the lion and the bear,</HI> when as weak as the dove, and as feeble as the lamb; an able and wi&s;e &s;tate&s;man; the giver of the Amer|ican Con&s;titution; the e&s;tabli&s;her of his country's peace, in the full enjoyment of its rights; a friend to literature, virtue, peace and good order; a pro|fe&s;&s;or of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, with a great &s;en&s;e of divine providence, which all his writings abundantly te&s;tify. He was one, <HI>who feared God, and e&s;chewed evil; given to ho&s;pitality;</HI> a lover of all men; never elated in pro&s;perity, nor depre&s;&s;ed in adver&s;ity; ever rea|dy to fly to his country's relief, and that in the mo&s;t di&s;couraging hour; ever &s;teadfa&s;t, and immovable as a rock.</P>
<P>HIS character may be viewed as immaculate. No one, whether at home or abroad, was ever able to tarni&s;h it. All their calumnies had no more effect, than the magician's rods had with Mo&s;es'. The brightne&s;s of WASHINGTON was &s;uch, they could not look &s;teadfa&s;tly upon him. His <HI>face was like the face of an angels.</HI> His brightne&s;s would di&s;pel all the darkne&s;s brought for his di&s;advantage, and cau&s;e it to flee away. <HI>The gates of hell never could prevail
<PB N="9" REF="037962_0008_10102DCF74DF08C0">
again&s;t him;</HI> but were forced to acknowledge, like the magicians of old, <HI>the finger of God is in this; let the people go.</HI></P>
<P>HIS abilities as a General and as a &s;tate&s;man have been acknowledged, both by friends and foes, citi|zens and foreigners. I would take notice of an in|&s;tance or two: The late King of Pru&s;&s;ia &s;ent him a medal, with this in&s;cription; "From the <HI>olde&s;t</HI> Gen|eral in Europe, to the <HI>greate&s;t</HI> General in the world." The Honorable CHARLES J. FOX, one of the able&s;t &s;tate&s;men in Europe, in the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Com|mons, ('94) delivered the following encomium upon General WASHINGTON: "Illu&s;trious man! de|riving honor le&s;s from the &s;plendor of his &s;ituation, than from the dignity of his mind; before whom all borrowed greatne&s;s &s;inks into in&s;ignificance. I can|not indeed," added Mr. Fox, "help admiring the wi&s;dom and the fortune of this great man:&mdash;not that by the phra&s;e <HI>fortune,</HI> I mean to derogate from his merit; but notwith&s;tanding his extraordinary talents and exalted integrity, it mu&s;t be con&s;idered as &s;in|gularly fortunate, that he &s;hould have experienced a lot, which &s;o &s;eldom falls to the portion of humanity; and have pa&s;&s;ed through &s;uch a variety of &s;cenes, without &s;tain and without reproach. It mu&s;t indeed create a&s;toni&s;hment, that, placed in circum&s;tances &s;o critical, and filling for a &s;eries of time a &s;tation &s;o con&s;picuous, his character &s;hould never once have been called in que&s;tion:&mdash;that he &s;hould in no one in&s;tance have been accu&s;ed either of improper in&s;o|lence, or of mean &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion in his tran&s;actions with foreign nations. It has been re&s;erved for him to run the race of glory, without experiencing the &s;malle&s;t interruption to the brilliancy of his career. The breath of cen&s;ure has not dared to impeach the
<PB N="10" REF="037962_0009_10102DD15E86ED18">
purity of his conduct; nor the eye of envy to rai&s;e us malignant glance to the elevation of his virtues. Such has been the tran&s;cendant merit and the unpar|alleled fate of this illu&s;trious man." Thus he.</P>
<P>THIS we all mu&s;t atte&s;t to, who have had a knowl|edge of the day of WASHINGTON. His enemies never were &s;uffered, nor able to crown him with a crown of thorns, nor to array him in a purple robe, with a mock &s;ceptre in his hand: No; but, by the grace of God, a diadem of glory, a robe of virtue, and a &s;ceptre of ju&s;tice and humanity, ever attend|ed him. Surely, to be deprived of &s;uch a patriot, father and friend, mu&s;t be a lo&s;s great indeed, and ought to excite in each of our brea&s;ts great &s;orrow and mourning. Which brings me</P>
<P N="2">II. Such a lo&s;s calls for great lamentation.</P>
<P>HERE I &s;hall give you the rea&s;ons, why we &s;hould lament, when great and good men are removed from us by death.</P>
<P>WHEN great and good men are taken away from us, &s;o much of the holy nature of God, as re&s;ided in them when with us, is now taken from the world. Tho&s;e precious abilities, tho&s;e excellent qualifica|tions, gifts and graces, which they were wont to ex|erci&s;e for the promotion of the honor and glory of God, the peace and pro&s;perity of the nation, with their prayers, have cea&s;ed. The nation, where they inhabited, had the profit of their abilities, gifts and graces; but now, no more! except only what is kept in remembrance, or upon record, of their holy and in&s;tructive words and examples.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="037962_0010_10102DD36269FB78">THE lo&s;s of great and good men in a nation; men, who have been patriots, deliverers and protectors of their nation and country, demands great lamenta|tion. <HI>They mourned for Aaron</HI> the high prie&s;t <HI>thirty days, even all the hou&s;e of I&s;rael. They wept for Mo&s;es in the plains of Moab thirty days.</HI> And <HI>devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.</HI> And why are &s;uch to be lamented? Becau&s;e, thereby, a gap is made to let in the judgments of God upon the remnant that remains. It is &s;aid of Mo&s;es; <HI>Therefore he,</HI> i. e. God, <HI>&s;aid, that he would de|&s;troy them, had not Mo&s;es, his cho&s;en, &s;tood before him in the breach, le&s;t he &s;hould de&s;troy them.</HI> Lot was another &s;uch; he &s;hielded wicked Sodom from the judg|ments of God; for God &s;ays to him, <HI>I cannot do any thing till thou art departed.</HI> When the Lord removes &s;uch excellent men, he thereby lays open a way to his vengeance. Hence, the death of great and good men is ominous of heavy judgments at hand. Says the prophet, <HI>The righteous peri&s;heth, and no man layeth it to heart: and merciful men are taken away, none con&s;ider|ing that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come.</HI> Yet, let us hope better things of our nation. How|ever, this is a very great and potent argument for our lamentation, this day, for the lo&s;s of him, who was our father and friend.</P>
<P>WHEN the fathers and defenders of a nation are removed by death, the beauty of that nation is <HI>fallen;</HI> the nation looks not like it&s;elf Wicked men are the blemi&s;hes of a people; but good men, upright men, men of ability and integrity, are the beauty and glory of a nation. How de&s;olate and melan|choly doth a family appear, when the kind hu&s;band, father and governor is removed. How much more &s;o, a commonwealth, when a redeemer, father, pro|tector
<PB N="12" REF="037962_0011_10102DD644FAF6A0">
and citizen is taken away. Take away good men from their coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y and nation, and what are they; but, like a vineyard, who&s;e hedge is removed, and &s;tone-wall broken down?</P>
<P>THE death of the fathers and defenders of our nation demands bitter lamentation; becau&s;e, their virtuous walk, pious and whole&s;ome words, and ex|amples are no more; and thus a way, for fraud and deceit, &s;in and iniquity, and every evil work, to &s;pring forth.</P>
<P>THE time, in which great and good men die, ag|gravates the lo&s;s. The day, in which we live, is a day of dreadful war and trouble in <HI>Europe</HI>; and all means have been pro&s;ecuted to involve us in the &s;ame; and we may feel the &s;torm before it be over|blown. Thus, to have our General and defender taken from us, at &s;uch a cri&s;is, greatly augments the &s;orrow of tho&s;e, who remain; and, that upon the following accounts: Great and good men are often taken away, when virtue and religion, when the &s;pir|it and power of godline&s;s, are upon the decline; when the love of many has become cold. Ofttimes they are removed, when virtuous and religious men are very few; when men of integrity and upright|ne&s;s are hardly to be found; when men are full of intrigue and deceit, watching every opportunity to entrap. But, we hope and tru&s;t, that there are &s;ome crying with the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>Help Lord, for the godly man cea&s;eth; for the righteous fail from among the children of men.</HI></P>
<P>BUT that, which mo&s;t aggravates the lo&s;s, is this; when it comes in a time, wherein the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is in any mea&s;ure hindered. In this ca&s;e, the death
<PB N="13" REF="037962_0012_10102DDB5B2566E0">
of our political fathers and defenders, is very pain|ful.</P>
<P>LASTLY. The removal of great and good men is a ju&s;t ground for lamentation. For, when we con&s;ider what influence our &s;ins and iniquities have had upon the judgments of God, our unworthine&s;s of great and good men, our unthankfulne&s;s for them, and non-improvement of the &s;ame, have provoked the Lord to remove them. Thus we &s;ee upon what rea&s;ons our &s;orrows are a debt due to the death of great and good men.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="application">
<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P>HERE is reproof for three kinds of people.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e, who are &s;o impious, that they are in|wardly glad, when great and good men are taken away. They took no delight in them, when living, and &s;ecretly rejoice when they are dead. But oh, that &s;uch men would con&s;ider their lo&s;s, and how expo&s;ed they are to the judgments of God: Says the prophet, <HI>Except the Lord of ho&s;ts had left unto us a very &s;mall remnan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, we &s;hould have been as Sodom, and we &s;hould have been like unto Gomorrha.</HI> Let the world think as they will of &s;uch men, &s;uch men are the <HI>&s;alt</HI> of the earth; a wall between nations and de&s;truction.</P>
<P>HERE is reproof for good men, who are too &s;en&s;e|le&s;s, and too apt, &s;lightly, to pa&s;s over &s;uch awful &s;trokes of God. For this it was, God reproved his ancient people the Jews. <HI>The righteous peri&s;heth, and no man layeth it to heart; and merciful men and taken a|way, none con&s;idering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come.</HI> Such tremendous &s;trokes of God's providence, certainly call for a greater &s;en&s;e and mourning, than is generally to be found in men.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="037962_0013_10102DDD1C182F38">SUCH a &s;troke of God's providence, as we have experienced, reproves even the very be&s;t of people. It is true, they lament; yet, they do not lament it as they ought. They &s;ay &s;uch a worthy has <HI>fallen,</HI> the defender of our country and the e&s;tabli&s;her of its peace; but they do not lament as they ought, in prayer to the Lord God; they do not cry as the P&s;almi&s;t did, <HI>Help, Lord! for the Godly man cea&s;eth; help, Lord! the remnant that is left; help, Lord! to repair the breach made by death.</HI> Alas! it is to be feared, that the lamentations of the be&s;t of men are not as they &s;hould be.&mdash;<HI>Lam.</HI> We may cry with the prophet of old, <HI>My father, my father, the char|iot of I&s;rael, and the hor&s;emen thereof!</HI> WASHING|TON&mdash;the GREAT&mdash;the GOOD&mdash;IS DEAD!&mdash; HE, who erected the chariot of the American I&s;rael, and formed the harne&s;s for the government there|of&mdash;is no more!

Let us cry earne&s;tly unto God to &s;ave us from war, and de&s;olating judgments; that the ble&s;&s;ings of his throne and of his foot&s;tool may come upon us: That human and divine in&s;truction may increa&s;e: That peace and good order, among all denominations of men, may prevail: That he would take under his fatherly protection our nation and country, the con&s;titution, and &s;everal govern|ments of the &s;ame: That he would cau&s;e ju&s;tice and judgment to run down as a river, and righteou&s;ne&s;s

as an overflowing flood: That he would ble&s;s us by &s;ea and land, in our ba&s;ket and &s;tore: That he would pro&s;per our mini&s;ters in foreign courts, and grant us favor in the eyes of all nations: That he would put an end to war&punc; and bring on the peaceable kingdom of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>ONCE more. <HI>Mo&s;es my &s;ervant is dead!</HI> WASH|INGTON my &s;ervant is dead! It becomes us to encourage Jo&s;hua. How? By a &s;trict ob&s;ervance of the con&s;titution and laws of the land: In &s;o do|ing, we &s;hall give life and vigor to the &s;upreme ma|gi&s;trate and court, and likewi&s;e to the &s;everal branch|es of the &s;ame. This is not all&punc; but, it will &s;erve to keep out of &s;ight, &s;uch as would be our ruin.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>LET us remember, that we are all mortal; that no one is exempted from the &s;troke of death. High &s;tations and relations, riches and honor, power, wi&s;|dom and goodne&s;s cannot <HI>di&s;charge</HI> from that <HI>war,</HI> or <HI>give unto God a ran&s;om. The fathers, where are they? And do the prophets live forever?</HI> No. All mu&s;t bow to the king of terrors. Let it become our chief concern, that we be ready to meet our God and Judge: That we be ready <HI>to enter in through the gates into the city new Jeru&s;alem,</HI> where &s;ickne&s;s and &s;or|row, death and &s;in, war and trouble, can never come; and where <HI>tears &s;hall be wiped from all eyes, and God &s;hall be all in all.</HI></P>
