<Q><HI>AND ALL THE COUNTRY WEPT WITH A LOUD VOICE.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AMIDST the vici&s;&s;itudes of time there are fre|quent occurrences, which impre&s;s the tender feel|ings of affection, and open the &s;prings of &s;or|row in the human heart. At &s;uch &s;ea&s;ons, de|cent tokens and expre&s;&s;ions of mourning become a matter of duty, dictated both from principles of humanity and piety: and to mingle our tears in &s;ocial &s;ympathy and condolence, gives a kind of ea&s;e to the painful &s;en&s;ations of grief.</P>
<P>SUCH events, al&s;o, in the cour&s;e of divine providence, &s;ometimes ari&s;e, as deeply impre&s;s the public mind, and &s;pread a &s;cene of mourn|ing over a whole nation, to which, the words of the text will &s;trictly apply, and it may be truly &s;aid, that all the country weeps with a loud voice. I think, I am not mi&s;taken in &s;aying, that &s;uch a &s;cene of mourning is now &s;pread over the land, to which we are adding our &s;mall trib|ute
<PB N="6" REF="038201_0004_101151A7B18CEBD8">
of grief, mingling our tears with tho&s;e of the public. The &s;olemnities of the day, with the gloomy tokens of death in our view, keep fre&s;h in all our minds, a painful &s;en&s;e of that &s;orrow|ful event, that excites the public grief; and mentioning of it, will but increa&s;e the &s;orrow. It is the death of General WASHINGTON, that has rai&s;ed the loud voice of weeping through the American States. And the death of &s;uch an illu&s;trious per&s;onage, the fir&s;t and mo&s;t accom|pli&s;hed general and &s;tate&s;man of his country, and the age; &s;uch a di&s;intere&s;ted patriot, &s;uch a defender, deliverer and father of his country, mu&s;t needs be deeply lamented in every heart, that is not totally void of all &s;en&s;ibility, grati|tude and piety.</P>
<P>THEREFORE, to direct and a&s;&s;i&s;t us in the pre&s;|ent &s;olemnities and duties, that we may mourn as chri&s;tians, and as the free and federal citizens of America ought to mourn; I would ob&s;erve, that our mourning &s;hould be accompanied with &s;entiments of piety; of ingenuous gratitude; of profound re&s;pect and reverence, to the mem|ory of the decea&s;ed; and al&s;o with devout and &s;ervent prayer to GOD.</P>
<P>THIS arrangement of the &s;ubject, will naturally direct to a devout acknowledgment of the hand of divine providence, in forming the in&s;truments,
<PB N="7" REF="038201_0005_101151AA78893C70">
and directing the mea&s;ures that effected the &s;ov|ereignty, the independency, the liberty and the increa&s;ing pro&s;perity of our country; and at the &s;ame time excite a grateful recollection of the patriotic &s;ervices, the unrivalled virtues and merits, and heroic achievements of our great leader in war and in peace, and in&s;pire a pro|found re&s;pect and reverence to his memory; and al&s;o mind us of our duty, to pray without cea&s;ing to GOD, that the example, the patrioti&s;m, the parental advice and coun&s;els, of &s;o illu&s;trious a per&s;on, may have a happy influence, upon all orders and ranks of men in the land, from gen|eration to generation, till time &s;hall be no more.</P>
<P>THE period having arrived in the cour&s;e of providence, when we &s;hould be freed from a foreign yoke, and our great revolution com|mence; as the foundation of nations, through human depravity, is generally laid in blood, and the &s;ceptre obtained by the &s;word, that GOD who formed Mo&s;es to be the deliverer of his people, from their bondage in Egypt, that GOD who taught the hands of David to war, and his fingers to fight, who girded Cyrus with his might, that GOD, formed, endowed and a&s;&s;i&s;ted <HI>GEORGE WASHINGTON,</HI> a native of Virginia, to be the deliverer of his country, and perform won|ders, which a&s;toni&s;h the world. As he was the gift of heaven to his country, the &s;ame unerring
<PB N="8" REF="038201_0006_101151AD03753160">
wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of GOD that gave, has now taken away, therefore, &s;entiments of profound &s;ilent &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the divine will, highly be|come us as Chri&s;tians. We are not to murmur or complain, but are allowed to mourn, in the exerci&s;e of pious re&s;ignation.</P>
<P>FURTHER to direct and a&s;&s;i&s;t our mourning, we mu&s;t by no means, omit a &s;incere thankful recollection of the many, the very many great and unparalleled &s;ervices this illu&s;trious bene|factor performed for his country, the memory of which, it is hoped, that time will never obliterate.</P>
<P>HAVING in early life exhibited &s;triking marks of &s;uperior military addre&s;s and talents in &s;ome memorable in&s;tances, he was appointed by the united voice of his country, to the &s;upreme command of the American army, at a time, when the defence of our lives, rights and liber|ties, and every thing dear and &s;acred to us, made it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for our country to appeal to arms. In this elevated character, as general of the armies of his country, he &s;hone brighter and brighter, like the ri&s;ing &s;un, until he had conquered his powerful enemies, and completely freed his country. And the many evidences of his profound knowledge in the &s;cience of arms; the repeated di&s;plays of mo&s;t
<PB N="9" REF="038201_0007_101151AE893869A0">
&s;uperior martial endowments; his intrepid firm|ne&s;s and magnanimity of mind; the many tro|phies of his victories; the powerful European armies, and the many dignified, boa&s;ting Briti&s;h generals he conquered and &s;ubdued, one after another, have fixed in his character, the indelible marks of one of the greate&s;t warriors and gene|rals of the world.</P>
<P>AND further, to increa&s;e our &s;en&s;e of the obli|gation of gratitude we are all under to this great man, let us, for a moment, think what had been our fate, and that of our country, &s;uppo&s;ing the &s;cene had been rever&s;ed, and victory had declar|ed for our enemy. In this ca&s;e, there is no doubt at all, from what experience had taught us, and from what &s;ome of us had &s;een and heard; and from the well known habits and cu&s;toms of the cruel tyrants of Europe, that as &s;hocking a &s;cene of hanging and gibbeting had been opened through the land, as ever was known in the world. And tho&s;e that e&s;caped with their lives, with their po&s;terity after them, would have been abject &s;laves to a foreign power. Con&s;idering this, and ad|verting to our pre&s;ent enjoyments and pro&s;pects, and the name of <HI>WASHINGTON</HI> mu&s;t excite the warme&s;t &s;en&s;e of gratitude in the heart of every citizen of America.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="038201_0008_101151B10C924AD0">
THERE is another well known fact, which I cannot omit mentioning on this occa&s;ion, as a mo&s;t convincing evidence of the &s;uperior addre&s;s, patrioti&s;m and integrity of this great man; I mean the manner of his retiring from the &s;cene of war, and di&s;banding his army, when he had delivered his country. With a powerful, well di&s;ciplined army, mo&s;t warmly attached to his per&s;on, and the military force of his country at his command, under every advantage to a&s;&s;ume the government, under any of tho&s;e dignified names of king, emperor, protector, &amp;c. which have been &s;o infatuating to the human mind in all ages of the world; (to which it was then &s;aid he was warmly &s;olicited by many) he di&s;banded his army in the greate&s;t tranquillity; giving them the mo&s;t wi&s;e and paternal coun&s;el and advice; and affectionately recommending of them to the government of their &s;everal &s;tates, for a ju&s;t com|pen&s;ation of their great and eminent &s;ervices; re&s;igned his command, and retired to his home in the character <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">. This, by all that knew <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">, will be con&s;idered as the mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> evidence of the great integrity of his heart. Perhaps there is not another man in the world, in that &s;ituation, that could, or would, have done the &s;ame.</P>
<P>LET us now, under the impre&s;&s;ions both of grief and gratitude, follow our great leader, from the
<PB N="11" REF="038201_0009_101151B39A4D5E30">
&s;cene of war, the field of victory, to the chair of &s;tate as the fir&s;t &s;upreme magi&s;trate and Pre&s;ident of the Union, to which he was called by the unit|ed voice of his country. His &s;ervices in this &s;tation of eminence, have a la&s;ting claim upon the grati|tude of this and future generations; and the evidences of &s;uperior political knowledge, and talents, for government, founded on a &s;eries of public facts, will tran&s;mit his memory to po&s;teri|ty as the fir&s;t and greate&s;t of magi&s;trates. For though we heartily wi&s;h and pray his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors may imitate his many excellences and virtues, we do not expect they will equal the great origi|nal. The general tranquillity, the marks of increa&s;|ing wealth and pro&s;perity con&s;picuous in every city and village throughout the United States; the entire confidence and unfeigned affection of his country, mu&s;t forever evince the &s;uperiority of his talents and wi&s;dom as fir&s;t magi&s;trate: and, when to the&s;e con&s;iderations, we recollect, that his generous patriotic &s;oul led him to decline re|ceiving any &s;alary or compen&s;ation for his &s;ervices, both as General of the Armies, and as Pre&s;ident of the Union, it &s;eems that a grateful remembrance of him could never be lo&s;t, and ought to be cher|i&s;hed in our brea&s;ts, under the deepe&s;t &s;en&s;ations of grief.</P>
<P>THESE imperfect hints (for I po&s;&s;e&s;s neither ma|terials nor abilities to do ju&s;tice to the &s;ubject)
<PB N="12" REF="038201_0010_101151B719B57B60">
I &s;ay, what has been but very imperfectly men|tioned, mu&s;t impre&s;s our minds with profound re|&s;pect and reverence to the memory of the decea&s;|ed. He has certainly merited it of his country; and &s;entiments of this kind ought to accompany our mourning. It is &s;carcely &s;uppo&s;able that the citizens of America, will ever lo&s;e a veneration for the name and memory of <HI>WASHINGTON.</HI> I do not recollect ever hearing of a &s;ingle in&s;tance of mi&s;take, error, or blame, that was ever ju&s;tly charged upon him; nor did I ever read of a per|&s;on in any age of the world, to whom, &s;uch real greatne&s;s and purity of character, would more ju&s;tly apply; or that ever merited more highly of this country.</P>
<P>AFTER a &s;eries of the mo&s;t eminent &s;ervices for his country, for the &s;pace of five and forty years, enough to bear down the firme&s;t con&s;titution, he declined being con&s;idered as a candidate for the office of Pre&s;ident, and thought proper to retire to the private walks of life. But &s;till retaining his di&s;intere&s;ted affection for his country, left it a legacy fraught with the mo&s;t tender, parental advice, coun&s;els, warnings and cautions, that human wi&s;dom could devi&s;e, which, ought to be engraven on the heart of every American citizen. As a further evidence of the &s;ingular greatne&s;s of his mind, upon retiring from &s;uch elevated &s;tations.
<PB N="13" REF="038201_0011_101151B9ACD6E5A8">
But &s;till con&s;idered his life as devoted to his coun|try's good, and upon the appearance of danger, once more accepted of the command of its army; but by a kind Providence never had an occa&s;ion to be called to the field of battle.</P>
<P>LET us now collect our thoughts, and prepare to follow this great man to his &s;ick and death|bed, bearing in our minds tho&s;e words of in|&s;piration, which bid us to "mark the perfect man, and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace." It appears from the public ac|counts, that his la&s;t &s;ickne&s;s was &s;udden and &s;hort; and that he &s;oon expected it would ter|minate as it did. But in the free and full u&s;e of his rea&s;on, he pre&s;erved the &s;ame firmne&s;s and magnanimity of mind in facing his la&s;t enemy, death, which always attended him in meeting his enemies in the field; accompanied with his &s;in|gular &s;erenity of countenance, and &s;upported, undoubtedly, by &s;entiments of real piety. As a &s;ingular and affecting evidence of this, when he actually found the cold hand of death was laid upon him, and the breath of life was departing, with his own hand he &s;upported his falling chin, and clo&s;ed his own eyes.</P>
<P>CAN we now wonder, my hearers, even from this very imperfect recollection of the life, the &s;ervices, the virtues, the merits and death, of this great and good Columbian Hero, Patriot and
<PB N="14" REF="038201_0012_101151BB32B892C8">
Father. Can we, I &s;ay, wonder that all the coun|try is now weeping with a loud voice? Could the ancient Jews, that &s;tubborn and hard-hearted race, mourn for their Mo&s;es, their Samuel and Jo&s;iah? They certainly would ri&s;e up in the judg|ment again&s;t us and condemn us, if we did not manife&s;t the deepe&s;t &s;en&s;ibility, at &s;o great a lo&s;s, &s;o lamentable an event, as the death of &s;uch a Friend, Benefactor, Defender, Deliverer, and Father of his Country. Wherefore,</P>
<P>THAT we may not only mourn, but mourn as chri&s;tians ought to mourn, let our tears be accom|panied with fervent and uncea&s;ing prayer to GOD, the great di&s;po&s;er of events, and repairer of breaches, that a wi&s;e improvement may be made, by all orders of men, of an occurrence in his holy providence, &s;o alarming, in&s;tructive and &s;orrowful. For this great man, though now dead, is yet &s;peaking to his country, and &s;peaking aloud in the example he &s;et, the eminent &s;ervices he per|formed, and e&s;pecially in the advice, coun&s;els and cautions he &s;ends us, as it were, from his tomb; and in his death, he is &s;till more &s;olemnly calling to us all, to be al&s;o ready.</P>
<P>MAY his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in office, and all our magi&s;|trates, imitate his example and virtues; and may a remembrance of his heroi&s;m in&s;pire the militia of our country through all generations, with the
<PB N="15" REF="038201_0013_101151BDB8B420E8">
&s;pirit and virtues that form the &s;oldier. And will GOD, of his mercy, &s;anctify the&s;e allotments of his Providence to the public good. Finally,</P>
<P>THAT the citizens of the American Republic of this generation, may never be reproached, for the want of a proper di&s;cernment of the charac|ters and conduct of their magi&s;trates and public &s;ervants; nor for the want of gratitude to their benefactors, and a decent re&s;pect and reverence to the per&s;ons and memory of their patriots; I &s;ay, that we may never have reproaches of this kind, let the faithful hi&s;torian of the&s;e times remember to record it, for the information of the world, and of all future generations: <HI>THAT AT THE DEATH OF GENERAL GEORGE WASHINGTON, "ALL THE COUNTRY WEPT WITH A LOUD VOICE."</HI></P>
