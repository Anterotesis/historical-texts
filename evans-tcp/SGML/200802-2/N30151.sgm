<P>THE Author of the following Pages has no View of impo&s;ing his Notions on any Per&s;on; but as far as they appear to be rea&s;onable, any Man is welcome to them. As to his Method, or Diction, his Aim was only to write &s;o as to be read, and to expre&s;s him&s;elf &s;o as to be under&s;tood; and he had a greater Ambition to make it appear, that he was a &s;incere Lover of the Country, than that he was a fine O|rator. He hopes that the Reader will not depart from Truth, to differ with him, and he expects no|tice no further than it &s;hall appear to be &s;o: But if there &s;hould be &s;uch an Animal, as a peevi&s;h <HI>Critick</HI> in this Climate, he wi&s;hes him a good Stomach, and he doubts not but according to it's Bigne&s;s he will have a plentiful Fea&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON CURRENCY.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the un&s;ettled State of the Currency has been the Occa&s;ion of great Inconveniency to this Province, and was once within View of its Ruine, I believe there are but few disinter|e&s;ted Men that will deny: And I conceive the Paper-Money at this time is very far from being on &s;o good an E&s;tabli&s;hment as it might be, and that &s;ome Per&s;ons are &s;o far from wanting it to be put on a better Foot|ing, that they had rather it were all de&s;troy'd. I &s;hall therefore endeavour to &s;hew, that there is a Nece&s;&s;ity for &s;ome Currency, and that that Currency, by the Nature of our Trade, cannot be Silver or Gold: That Pa|per-Money will an&s;wer all the Ends, that any other Money will, for a Medium of Trade. And then I &s;hall propo&s;e a Method for e&s;tabli&s;hing it on a firm and la&s;ting Foundation; and examine the Con&s;equences thereof to this Province, and the Effects it may have on the Trade of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="040043_0004_1015CE478C452CA0">If any &s;hould &s;ay that we have no nece&s;&s;ity for Currency at all, but that our Trade may as well be carried on by <HI>Barter</HI>: To him I an&s;wer. He that has well con&s;idered the Inconveniencies that attend that Method, I am of Opinion, will not be fond of it long.</P>
<P>By Barter you can neither &s;ell, nor buy, but once a Year, except from the Stores, that are up and down the Country, and you mu&s;t be at their Mercy, not on|ly for the prices of their Goods, but of your own too: And they will generally get more by &s;ending them from the Ship to the Store, than the Merchant in <HI>En|gland</HI> gets by tran&s;porting them from <HI>England</HI> hither.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides we have &s;everal In&s;tances, that the Coun|try-Stores have left many Families, which had &s;everal Negroes, without &s;carce a Negro to help them. And I believe had it not been for an extraordinary Occur|rence, it had been much wor&s;e.</P>
<P>Again, a <HI>Barter-Trade</HI> doth, I conceive, tend to the Ruine of all the Towns in the <HI>Province</HI>; and the People will live &s;catter'd about; only with a few Tra|ding-Hou&s;es among&s;t them, to the great Di&s;courage|ment of foreign Trade, and the great perplexity and Inconveniency of the Trader.</P>
<P>And farther, Trading by Barter doth tend to lodge the greate&s;t part of the Riches of a Province in a few Hands, and the Con&s;equences of that will be, the ma|king the poorer &s;ort very ba&s;e and mean, &s;o that, to u&s;e My Lord <HI>Bacon's</HI> Words, the one fiftieth Man of them, will not be fit for a Helmet: And I think it much concerns the Intere&s;t of this <HI>Province,</HI> to keep up the Spirits of the lower &s;ort of People, for we have much rea&s;on to expect great U&s;e of them e're long, both from tho&s;e among us, and tho&s;e behind us.
<PB N="5" REF="040043_0005_1015CE4D4E4C6A68">If you have a Barter-Trade, a Man cannot hire a poor Man, and pay him his Wages when he has done his Work, but he mu&s;t go to the Stores, and take per|haps what he doth not want; and the Store-Keeper will get &s;o much out of his Wages as will almo&s;t &s;tarve him.</P>
<P>And I am apt to think every Man, tho' he had no po|litical or Religious Views, &s;hould think it the Intere&s;t of his Family, to have provi&s;ion made, to keep the poorer &s;ort of them from Oppre&s;&s;ion to Po&s;terity: For we have many In&s;tances among&s;t us, of tho&s;e who&s;e Fathers in the la&s;t Age were rich enough, altho' they have little or nothing now. And no Man knows, (&s;uch is the Vici&s;&s;itude of Human Affairs) what his Family may come too. If his Family be very great, it is probable &s;ome of them will e're long be of the poorer &s;ort, and the providing for them (and with them the Poor, in general,) is the mo&s;t Beneficent Thing a Man can do. The Rich, he need not doubt, will know well enough how to provide for them&s;elves. Then on the other &s;ide, Men of over-grown-E&s;tates, none ought to be fond of, no not even among Princes: For if great Parts, great Ambition and great Valour &s;hould happen to meet in the &s;ame Per&s;on, the World has had In&s;tances enough, what they are then to ex|pect. So that I take it to be the Intere&s;t of <HI>America,</HI> and, I apprehend al&s;o, the Policy of <HI>England,</HI> to keep the Wealth of <HI>America,</HI> as near as can be, on a Par, a|mong&s;t the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Subjects.</P>
<P>If any &s;hould &s;ay, The&s;e are Con&s;equences that cannot affect this Age: Perhaps they may not; but great Alterations in States are generally the Effects of the Councils of preceeding Ages, and wi&s;e Governments
<PB N="6" REF="040043_0006_1015CE4FD63E7D10">always con&s;ider what Effect their Tran&s;actions may have on Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Now I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew, that by the Nature of our Trade, this <HI>Currency</HI> cannot be <HI>Silver</HI> or <HI>Gold.</HI> For &s;uppo&s;ing we now had a &s;ufficient Quantity of Gold and Silver for a <HI>Medium of Trade,</HI> our Trade is &s;uch, that the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Ships always do or can bring in more in Value of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Commodities, than their Ships will carry back in our Produce. Now this Overplus, or the Ballance of the Account, the Trader, when his Ship is loaded with our Produce, will carry away in our Money, this would &s;oon drain us of all our Money, unle&s;s we had Mines, or &s;ome Trade, the Returns whereof, in Silver, would be an&s;werable to the Ballance of our Trade with <HI>England,</HI> which we have not.</P>
<P>There is another Rea&s;on, why Silver will never re|main here long, which is, that the Trader will always carry away our Money, in&s;tead of our Produce, when|&s;oever Money will an&s;wer his Ends better in <HI>Europe,</HI> and leave our Produce to peri&s;h on our Hands, to the great Detriment both of <HI>England</HI> and this <HI>Province,</HI> as I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew hereafter; and this can|not be prevented by Law, no, altho' you &s;hould make it Death.</P>
<P>But it may be &s;aid, that formerly Silver was very plenty here. I an&s;wer thereto, the Trade then of this Province was very incon&s;iderable, to what it is now, and the Returns then made to <HI>Europe,</HI> were chiefly in Skins, which Skins were then of a great Value, and a Ship would carry a great Quantity of them. Al&s;o the <HI>Privateers</HI> brought in great Quantities of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Silver, and we likewi&s;e &s;ent a con&s;iderable Quantity of
<PB N="7" REF="040043_0007_1015CE525369A678">Beef, Pork and Pea&s;e to the I&s;lands, which brought us in, be&s;ides what we wanted of their Produce, a great Deal of Silver; &s;o it is no worder that Silver was then plenty here: But this is all cea&s;ed, and not to be expected again. And now if we will have any Cur|rency, we mu&s;t look &s;ome other way; and I think we cannot find a better than our Paper-Bills, as being a Currency, which will never be carried away from us, and prevent the Inconveniencies that will follow from the coming and going of our Currency, and which we have found, by &s;o many Years experience, to an&s;wer the Ends of any other Currency, for the Ea&s;e and Advantage both of Buyer and Seller, of the Foreign and Dome&s;tick Trader. For this you may buy, what|ever can be got for any Money in this Province; nay, even Gold and Silver it &s;elf.</P>
<P>But becau&s;e there has been great Noi&s;e and Clamour again&s;t tho&s;e Paper-Bills by &s;ome Per&s;ons, for no other Rea&s;on, that I could ever &s;ee, than that if they could have got them de&s;troy'd, they would have made their E&s;tates five or &s;ix times as good; and by others, be|cau&s;e they did not know what they talked of, but to keep up the Clamour, I &s;hall endeavour to trace tho&s;e Bills from their beginning, and make &s;uch Ob&s;erva|tions as &s;hall occur as I pa&s;s along.</P>
<P>And here I would have it ob&s;erv'd, that I &s;hall on|ly relate what my Memory will readily &s;ugge&s;t, having no other way at pre&s;ent to be inform'd, tho' I que&s;tion not but there are Per&s;ons enough &s;till living, who can te&s;tifie, that I am pretty near the Truth.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e Bills, as I have been inform'd, were fir&s;t made &s;oon after the <HI>St. Augu&s;tine</HI> Expedition, which, if I am not mi&s;taken, was about the Year 1701, or
<PB N="8" REF="040043_0008_1015CE54A4DDBA98">1702. The Quantity then made, was according to my Information Four or Five Thou&s;and Pounds, and tho&s;e pa&s;s'd currant, as Silver, &s;o that I remember in 1711, or 1712 I had a Piece of Eight for a Crown-Bill; then Pitch and Rice were from 15 s. to 17 s. 6 d. or there about.</P>
<P>In 1712, or 1713 there were 52,000 Pounds made, and let out on Intere&s;t, which was of va&s;t Advantage to many Men, and of great U&s;e to the Country; and Rice and Pitch continued, until the Indian War, not to exceed 22 s. 6 d. the highe&s;t, notwith&s;tanding great Quantities of both tho&s;e Commodities began to be then made. In the Year 1715 began the Indian War, which was the greate&s;t Calamity that ever happened, not on|ly to the Country, but to our Bills al&s;o. For the In|dians now ri&s;ing up in Arms again&s;t us on every &s;ide, put the Country into &s;uch a Con&s;ternation, that the Thoughts of a great many were more, how they &s;hould &s;ecure &s;omewhat in &s;ome other place, and to get away if they could, than to &s;tay here to defend the Country. And many per&s;ons, nay even from <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> who could not go them&s;elves, &s;ent their Wives and Fami|lies off to the Northern Colonies. So that tho&s;e who had Paper-Bills in their Hands, would give any Price either for Silver or Gold, or our Produce, to &s;end with their Families to provide for them, and to &s;ettle them in &s;ome other place, if they &s;hould be forc'd to leave this Province. By this means our Bills were &s;o much depreciated in their Value, that they were not worth above the one fourth part of what they had been.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the Foreign Merchants, who had any effects here, gave Orders to their Factors, to remit tho&s;e Ef|fects to them; and a great many had their Effects &s;ent
<PB N="9" REF="040043_0009_1015CE583322FCF8">them, I believe to their great Lo&s;s, and to almo&s;t the ruine of many, at a time too, when a great part of the Province were drove from their Settlements, and tho&s;e who could &s;tay at their Hou&s;es, were obliged to appear in Arms, &s;o that there was but very little Produce made, and for that which was made, the Owner might get almo&s;t what price he plea&s;ed. Then did the A&s;|&s;embly likewi&s;e &s;tamp more Bills, in order to pay the publick Debts, which Bills they entred into Mea&s;ures to &s;ink again, &s;o that &s;ome were &s;unk and others not, according to tho&s;e Laws. Moreover Laws were made to i&s;&s;ue out Rice Notes on Intere&s;t, and then other Laws to take that Intere&s;t away; and thus it was di&s;|tracted between &s;inking and making for &s;everal Years, till at la&s;t, in General <HI>Nichol&s;on's</HI> time there came out a Proclamation, to put the Laws in Execution, for &s;inking the Money, which would have &s;unk all the Money in the Province, excepting about 50,000 l. But he notwith&s;tanding pa&s;s'd a Law to continue it, for &s;ome time longer, which diverted the Storm for that Sea&s;on. At length the &s;inking it was to have been fini&s;h'd, all except 50,000 l. when there were ma|ny Men in the Province who could have put it all into their Che&s;ts, &amp; this at a time too, when the Bounty was taken off our Pitch, and that Trade almo&s;t cea&s;ed with it: At the &s;ame time our Rice Crops fell very &s;hort, and the Country va&s;tly in Debt, and what made our Ca&s;e &s;till wor&s;e, there was nothing &s;ub&s;titu|ted in the room of our Bills, to pay our Debts with Nay, our &mdash; were &s;o &s;tiff, that they would not declare, even Silver, or Gold, at any rate a legal Tender, and there was then no other Legal Money in the Province: Be&s;ides, I much que&s;tion,
<PB N="10" REF="040043_0010_1015CE5AA49785F0">whether <HI>Proclamation</HI> or <HI>Sterling</HI> would have &s;atis|fied &s;ome Creditors, for their Demands &s;eemed to ri&s;e very fa&s;t, and if tho&s;e Debts had been to be levied by Execution, (for the People could hardly have paid their Debts otherwi&s;e, unle&s;s they had &s;old their Slaves at Vendue) this would not only have &s;unk the Money, but the Country with it; but, thanks be to God, I hope this is prevented.</P>
<P>Now let any disintere&s;ted Man con&s;ider, how our Money has been &s;erv'd, what by &s;inking it, and then pa&s;&s;ing it, &s;ometimes making it more, at other times le&s;s, one while Intere&s;t, another while none, and then the Fa|ctions here about it, according as Mens Intere&s;ts were for or again&s;t it's encrea&s;ing or not; and then again their Writing to <HI>England,</HI> to endeavour to di&s;grace it there, all this was enough to perplex and di&s;tract us, tho' we had had the be&s;t Money in the World: When any unbias'd Per&s;on, I &s;ay, has con&s;idered what I have here advanced, I think he will plainly &s;ee, that the Calamities, which have happened to our Money, have not been from the Nature of Paper-Money it&s;elf, but from the Indian War, and the ill Management it has met with &s;ince, by &s;hifting it into &s;o many Shapes.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all this, our Money has kept near the &s;ame Value, for the&s;e Ten or Twelve Years la&s;t pa&s;t: Nay, altho' there has been of late as much more added to it; for the Merchants Notes, for which they have 10 per Cent Intere&s;t, are 40- or 50,000 l. and the Publick Orders, for which they give 5 per Cent, are I think <HI>Sixty odd Thou&s;and Pounds,</HI> (a Thing which may look &s;omewhat unaccountable to a Stranger) &s;o that there is upwards of <HI>One hundred thou&s;and Pounds</HI> added to our Currency, neverthele&s;s it has had no Ef|fect
<PB N="11" REF="040043_0011_1015CE5ECC867B60">on our Exchange: I am &s;ure, the Prices of our Commodities are not advanced by it. So that it is plain from Experience, it is not making move Money, (provided you do not make more than is convenient for a Medium to carry on our Trade) but it is the &s;hifting it into &s;o many Shapes, as I &s;aid before, which is the Prejudice both to the Planter and Trader: Nei|ther is it material what it is made of, provided it be done by common con&s;ent.</P>
<P>There are &s;trange Notions in the World, concerning Money, as if nothing but Silver and Gold were fit for it; but the U&s;e of it is only to carry on Trade with more Ea&s;e among Mankind, for which Silver and Gold have got the general Con&s;ent. But if Paper, or Leather, or any other Thing, had as general a Con|&s;ent, it would an&s;wer the &s;ame End as well. It is not in the Power of any Per&s;on, or Country, I think, to alter this general Con&s;ent, but only Time and Cu&s;tom: Yet any Country by Laws and common Con&s;ent, a|mong&s;t them&s;elves, may make any Thing el&s;e an&s;wer the very &s;ame as Silver, or Gold, for a Medium of Trade, within them&s;elves. As for Foreign Trade, that is carried on by exchanging the Produce or Ma|nufacture of one Country for another.</P>
<P>Silver or Gold, or any other Money, are not ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to the happine&s;s of Human Life, al|tho' it be convenient and much ea&s;ier for the Tran&s;|acting of the Affairs among&s;t Mankind: But it is a Fancy to think, that nothing but Silver and Gold will do. Whatever will procure a private Man Nece&s;&s;a|ries for him&s;elf and Family, is a good to him as Sil|ver or Gold: For he can neither eat it, nor drink it, nor wear it; and whatever will procure a Prince wherewith
<PB N="12" REF="040043_0012_1015CE6058F9A570">to &s;upport and defend his State, is as good as Silver or Gold to him al&s;o.</P>
<P>I think I need not have &s;aid half &s;o much on this Head, becau&s;e Experience demon&s;trates it; but I find it very difficult for &s;ome Per&s;ons, to reconcile the Idea of Money with any Thing be&s;ides Silver and Gold.</P>
<P>The next Thing which I propo&s;ed was, to offer my Thoughts on a Method, for E&s;tabli&s;hing this Paper-Currency on a la&s;ting Foundation, and in this I think there is no great Difficulty: For let a Law be made, to provide for the &s;tamping of a &s;ufficient Quantity of Bills, &s;uppo&s;e 250 or 300,000 <HI>Pounds,</HI> let this Money be lent out on Intere&s;t, as much to every Man, as &s;hall be thought convenient, upon &s;ufficient Security; let this Law be made here by common Con&s;ent, and let it be &s;ent home, to have the Royal A&s;&s;ent; and let it likewi&s;e be unlimited, &s;o that it be not altered, until it be done again by common Con&s;ent, and let this be kept as a <HI>con&s;tant Currency,</HI> until they can find &s;omewhat bet|ter to &s;ub&s;titute in its room: For to de&s;troy the Mo|ney of any place, and &s;ub&s;titute nothing in the 100m of it, is, I think, a prepo&s;terous Way of acting, and enough to involve any Place into Confu&s;ion. Be&s;ides, part of the Intere&s;t of this Money &s;o lett out, may be applied towards the calling in the <HI>old Bills,</HI> until all the Money of the Province is upon one Foundation.</P>
<P>If the Sum of <HI>Three Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> &s;hould be made, that, at 10 per Cent, will bring in <HI>Thirty Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> per Annum, enough &s;uffici|ently to defray the ordinary Charges of the Go|vernment, and be of great U&s;e to many private Per|&s;ons; tho' I think it would be much better that the Intere&s;t &s;hould not be &s;o high, becau&s;e it is (as times
<PB N="13" REF="040043_0013_1015CE63D8927760">are,) more than can well be made of it; and if it be put at a lower Rate, it will be a means to lower all the Intere&s;t throughout the Province: For all Per&s;ons, ex|cept the immediate Gainers, mu&s;t look upon high In|tere&s;t as a prejudice to any Country: It makes the rich Man, who &s;hould lay Schemes for Improvement, la&s;t, and the middle &s;ort work as it were in the Fire, &s;o that their Affairs will not admit them to go upon any new Method, for improving and enriching the Province; if they &s;uffer a few Lo&s;&s;es, they are thereby &s;oon ruin'd. Be&s;ides it is better that the People &s;hould pay &s;ome Taxes, than that the Intere&s;t of Money &s;hould be high: For, to have no publick Taxes, will make the People re&s;ty, when there is occa&s;ion; and too heavy Taxes eat out their very Victuals.</P>
<P>All Governments, I think, ought to take care, not to taxe their People beyond their Abilities, altho' it may be generally nece&s;&s;ary and expedient, to lay &s;ome Kind of Tax upon them, yet it ought to be as ea&s;y as the Circum&s;tances of Affairs will po&s;&s;ibly admit.</P>
<P>By this Method, which I have propo&s;ed, the Cur|rency will be no longer a publick Debt, but every pri|vate Man's E&s;tate (who takes up the Money) will be bound for the Payment of it: In what? Why in Bills: For if I pay it in Bills, and am forc'd to give as much Rice, Pitch, or Silver for tho&s;e Bills, and if tho&s;e Bills will fetch as much Rice, Pitch, or Silver to the Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or of them, as their Value is: Is it not to all Intents and Purpo&s;es the &s;ame, as if I paid it in either of tho&s;e Commodities? But becau&s;e the Stre&s;s of the whole Scheme lyeth here, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;earch this Matter to the Bottom.</P>
<P>When the Publick lends this Money out, every
<PB N="14" REF="040043_0014_1015CE657AFEC498">Man takes as much as will di&s;charge an equal Debt, or purcha&s;e him as many Commodities, as &s;o much Rice, Pitch, or Silver; hereby the Creditor or Trader is not injured, by rea&s;on, he can command as much Rice, Pitch, or Silver, whenever he plea&s;es, as we &s;ee from every days Experience. That is true, &s;ay &s;ome, but how will it be at the winding up of the Clew? Why the winding up of the Clew will be this, when e|ver it &s;hall be thought fit, that tho&s;e Bills &s;hall pur|cha&s;e Rice, Pitch, or Silver no longer, then he that is Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of tho&s;e Bills, will go to the Trea&s;urer, and &s;ay, Here I have &s;o many of tho&s;e Bills, and they will purcha&s;e me nothing, now, what mu&s;t I do with them? The Trea&s;urer will an&s;wer, I have &s;uch and &s;uch Se|curity for the paying in of tho&s;e Bills by &s;uch a Time, and if they are not paid, I &s;hall &s;ue for them, now they mu&s;t be forc'd to give you &s;o much Rice, or Pitch, or Silver, as they are worth, in order to pay me: For if I &s;ue, I mu&s;t not only have the Bills, but they mu&s;t pay the Co&s;ts of Suit.</P>
<P>One Example I imagine will clearly illu&s;trate this Matter. A Creditor comes to a Debtor for his Mo|ney, the Debtor goes to his Neighbour to borrow it, his Neighbour &s;ays, I have not the Money: But I will give this Gentleman my Note for the Money, if he will take that; the Creditor is content to take the Note, and gives the Debtor a Receipt, and the Debtor is di&s;charg'd from that Man. Well, but, &s;ays the Neighbour, you mu&s;t give me Security, that you will bring me my Note again by &s;uch a Time: Content, &s;ays the other. Now, perhaps this Note has gone through Twenty Hands, &s;ince it went from the fir&s;t Giver of it, but whoever is Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of that Note,
<PB N="15" REF="040043_0015_1015CE69637DCCD8">when the fir&s;t Giver wants it, will never part with it, until he has the fir&s;t Value of it: If the fir&s;t Debtor will not bring the Note, it is true, he, <HI>i. e.</HI> Neighbour mu&s;t pay it him&s;elf; but then he will &s;ue his Security and recover his Damage, becau&s;e the Note was not brought according to the Agreement. I think this wants no Explanation.</P>
<P>But now the Ca&s;e is very different as to the pre&s;ent Money: For if that Proclamation which came over from <HI>England,</HI> in Governor <HI>Nichol&s;on's</HI> time, had been put in Execution, the Bills would have &s;unk in every Mans Hands who po&s;&s;e&s;s'd them.</P>
<P>I have not de&s;cended to every Minute particular, that may be nece&s;&s;ary in &s;uch a Bill, for if this Method &s;hould be thought fea&s;ible, that will ea&s;ily occur to a|ny Man's Imagination, and to have been particular, it would have been nece&s;&s;ary to enquire into all the Cir|cum&s;tances of the pre&s;ent Currency.</P>
<P>All that remains now in the Pro&s;ecution of my fir&s;t De&s;ign is, to enquire what Effect this may have on this Province of <HI>South-Carolina,</HI> and the Trade of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Effects of Paper-Money here, one would think I &s;hould have no occa&s;ion to &s;ay any Thing a|bout it, becau&s;e the Effects thereof have been &s;o vi&s;i|ble to the Advantage of this Province: For let any Man look round him, and ob&s;erve the va&s;t Improve|ment made in this Country, for tho&s;e Ten or Twelve Years la&s;t pa&s;t, which was, in a great mea&s;ure, owing to our Paper-Currency, as might ea&s;ily be &s;hewed; and then let him con&s;ider, that when our Money has been near &s;inking, how the Country has dwindled, and as it were pined after it: And now again, when our Mo|ney
<PB N="16" REF="040043_0016_1015CE6C113551B8">is a little help'd, the Country is, I thank God, in very flouri&s;hing Circum&s;tances. So that, if I went no further than Experience, it is very evident, that Paper-Money is for the Advantage of this Province.</P>
<P>I believe there are but few Traders, who are not per&s;waded, that plenty of Money is a va&s;t Ea&s;e to Trade in any Country, and I think I have made it appear, that this Paper-Money is as good as Silver, for a Medium of Trade; but I think it is far better in relation to the Trade of this Province of <HI>South Caro|lina,</HI> e&s;pecially if it were on the footing I propo&s;e: For had we Silver, the Traders, when&s;oever it &s;uited their Intere&s;t, would carry off our Money, in&s;tead of our Produce, (as I &s;aid before) and this would have the&s;e Inconveniencies, that by this Means our Curren|cy would be le&s;&s;ened, and in &s;uch fluctuating Circum|&s;tances, as would much perplex us; or rather it would be &s;oon brought to nothing, and we &s;hould be left to &s;hift without it, to the de&s;troying of our Towns, and the Ruin of our ordinary and poor People, and I think <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the great Damage of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Trade; but of this hereafter. Add to this, that the carrying away our Money, and le&s;&s;ening our Currency, would not be the only Inconveniencies, but our Goods would be left here, to peri&s;h on our Hands, which would &s;oon make us wary of making them, and put us upon a Nece&s;&s;i|ty of making our own Clothes, and our own Liquor, within our &s;elves, which, I think, would not then be &s;o much for our Advantage as it is at pre&s;ent for us to buy them.</P>
<P>But there is another Advantage from the&s;e Paper-Bills to this Province, upon the former Scheme. The Intere&s;t of them by this means would be a &s;tanding
<PB N="17" REF="040043_0017_1015CE6F98B84AF8">Fund, to appropriate to any U&s;e what&s;oever, without taxing the People, which, I think, will be very diffi|cult to contrive without it. Be&s;ides, in any publick Exigency the Legi&s;lature might command whatever Money they wanted, for it would be but offering any money'd Man the Bonds and the Security, which the Public &s;hall have, from &s;ome of the principal of their Creditors, and have them a&s;&s;ign'd over to them, until they were paid, and there is no one, who had it, but would lend Money on &s;uch Security, having &s;ome of the principal Men, be&s;ides the publick Faith, to make it good.</P>
<P>But what need have I to &s;hew the Advantages it will be to the Publick? Let any Man con&s;ider, what a Turn it will give to the publick Credit, when the Legi&s;lature have the Command of the Principal and Intere&s;t of 250, or 300,000 <HI>Pounds</HI>?</P>
<P>I think that this Opportunity ought by no Means to be neglected: For if there comes a War, (as we know not how &s;oon,) this Country will have Occa|&s;ion enough for Money, it being a Frontier again&s;t two powerful Enemies, the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Spaniards</HI>; be&s;ides tho&s;e about us and among&s;t us: And if we are then forc'd to tax our People for as much we &s;hall want, I believe we &s;hall &s;oon bring them into very great Streights: For it is not here as it is in <HI>England,</HI> in ca&s;e of a War; If the People of <HI>England</HI> are taxed heavy, this is all that they bear, and they have the &s;ame Opportunity to take care of their Affairs, as in times of Peace: but the Ca&s;e is very different here, per|haps it may be dangerous for &s;ome Per&s;ons, to abide by their Affairs, &s;o that they will be &s;o far from doing any Thing towards the Support of the Government,
<PB N="18" REF="040043_0018_1015CE7123E75090">that they will hardly be able to provide for them&s;elves. And tho' at pre&s;ent it is Peace, yet look but on al|mo&s;t every thing that belongs to the Publick, and &s;ee if it is not in the greate&s;t Di&s;order for Want of Money. I need not de&s;cend to particulars I &s;uppo&s;e, and &s;ay what Condition our Fortifications are in, and how our Canons are almo&s;t all di&s;mounted, and how much our &s;mall Arms want repair <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Now as to the Con&s;equences of this Scheme with re&s;pect to the Briti&s;h Trade, I think it is &s;o far from being a Prejudice thereto, that nothing can be done which will &s;upport the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Trade more. I believe this may &s;eem a &s;trange <HI>Paradox</HI> to &s;ome Per&s;ons, but I would have nothing regarded in the&s;e Papers, but what upon Examination &s;hall appear to be Truth.</P>
<P>The De&s;ign, as I &s;aid before, of Trade, is the Ex|changing of the Superfluities of one Country, Family, or Per&s;on, for the Nece&s;&s;aries that may be had from another. Now the Superfluities of our Country are Pitch, Tar and Rice, that is to &s;ay, we make more than we can u&s;e of them. The Superfluities of <HI>En|gland</HI> are the Woolen Manufactures, Iron of all &s;orts, with &s;everal other Things that need not be named here: And as <HI>England</HI> wants our Produce, but more e&s;pe|cially Pitch and Tar, &s;o we want their coar&s;e Cloths, Iron and Linnens, and &s;everal other Things. Now provided the Merchant of <HI>England</HI> can tran&s;port to us tho&s;e Commodities &s;o, that when he has his Returns in our Produce, he has acquired a &s;ufficient Gain; what does he, or what need he care, what we make U&s;e of as a Medium for our Trade?</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid, that if we had Silver-Currency, it would perhaps &s;ometimes be more for his Advantage, to
<PB N="19" REF="040043_0019_1015CE74E1D08E20">take away our Silver, rather than our Produce: I deny not but it might; yet I think I have made it ap|pear, that by the Nature of our Trade, he cannot have Silver from us long, unle&s;s we had Mines: But &s;uppo&s;e they could &s;hift Silver, and &s;ometimes carry it to, at other times bring it from <HI>England,</HI> this is no better than Stock-jobbing in Trade; it would be on|ly carrying the Money from one part of the Kings Dominions to another, but nothing of any real Gain to the Monarchy.</P>
<P>The Trade of one part of the Kings Dominions with another ought to be con&s;idered different from that, which we carry on with any Foreign Prince: For if the Merchant &s;hould bring Money out of <HI>England,</HI> to purcha&s;e our Produce, then he would leave the Cloths and Iron, and other Commodities, that we want and they did not know what to do with, upon their Hands; and if he &s;hould carry away our Money, in|&s;tead of our Produce, then he would leave our Com|modities to peri&s;h on our Hands, when perhaps they wanted them in <HI>England.</HI> This is only playing Tricks and of no U&s;e to the Kingdom.</P>
<P>But here is another ill Con&s;equence, which is wor&s;e, to the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Trade: The People of this Province by this will find, that their Supply, and the Sale of their Produce, will be &s;o uncertain, that they will endea|vour to provide for their own Nece&s;&s;aries. Every Man knows, that it is very ea&s;y for us, to have more Wool and Cotton, not to &s;ay Silk, of our own Growth, than we can expend, and we have Per&s;ons enough, that can manufacture it. Then we, who now take away more of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufactures than any other Province, nay, &s;ome &s;ay, than all the Provinces in <HI>America,</HI> be|&s;ides
<PB N="20" REF="040043_0020_1015CE78860EA8C0">&s;hall be able to &s;upply others from hence, and the ill Con&s;equences will be this, as to <HI>England,</HI> they will not only loo&s;e the Sale of &s;o much of their Ma|nufactures, but they will be forc'd to purcha&s;e our Produce at a dearer rate from other Places. So that I think 'tis very plain, that Want of Paper-Bills will not only hurt our Trade, but the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Trade al&s;o, and I could very ea&s;ily make appear, were it within my De&s;ign, that Paper-Money in <HI>America</HI> will great|ly contribute towards the Wealth and Intere&s;t of <HI>En|gland</HI>; but I waive this, as being foreign to my Pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides both Wheat and Barley will grow very well here, and we could ea&s;ily, now we are &s;o well acquainted with the Country, provide Mills to grind it, and if we were to go upon that, that would cut off the Northward Trade, from whence we have almo&s;t all our Flower and Beer, and with our Produce they make Returns to <HI>England.</HI> So that, if our Paper-Money &s;hould be de&s;troy'd, it would cut off the grea|te&s;t part of the Trade of this Province, and oblige us to provide our own Nece&s;&s;aries, much more to the da|mage of tho&s;e that trade with us, than of our&s;elves. For now, we trade for almo&s;t all our Cloathing, and all our Liquor, and Flower, and many other Things, which we could ea&s;ily provide here. Therefore, I think, it is not only our own Intere&s;t, but the Inte|re&s;t of all who trade with us, that we &s;hould have Pa|per-Money among&s;t us. And I think, it is equally the Intere&s;t of all, that this Money &s;hould be put on &s;uch a Foundation, that it &s;hould &s;eldom or never be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, or at lea&s;t, not until they find &s;omewhat that is better, to &s;ub&s;titute in the room of it.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="040043_0021_1015CE7A10E33248">I have only one Thing more to offer, and that is, The Ca&s;e is not now, whether we &s;hall have Bills, or Silver, for Currency, but whether we &s;hall have pu|blick Money e&s;tabli&s;h'd by Law; or whether we &s;hall have private Mens Notes pa&s;s as a Currency? The Ca&s;e is very plain, that the Merchant will not be &s;a|tisfied without &s;ome Currency, nor indeed will the Planter. There are many who wait to &s;ee what the Publick will do, in relation to tho&s;e Bills; and if it comes to that, that we cannot do without Bank-Notes, it is probable there may be many other Banks made: For I apprehend the Bankers find their Account in it, and it is like, others will be willing to reap &s;ome part of the Benefit, as well as they, &s;o that we &s;hall have the Country run into Parties and Factions about tho&s;e Banks, and we may depend upon it, they will do what they can to influence Elections and Votes in A&s;&s;em|blies. How far indeed they will go, is not ea&s;y to determine: But this, I think, may be &s;aid, that if the Legislature &s;hould &s;it regardle&s;s and let the Command of the Currency go out of their Hands, they would &s;oon be obliged to &s;ubmit to tho&s;e who have the Com|mand of it, and then our A&s;&s;emblies for ever after are to be only a No&s;e of Wax.</P>
<P>I have now done, and in the Pro&s;ecution of this Ar|gument, I think, I have aim'd &s;olely at Truth, and the Intere&s;t of this Province, which I leave to the Con|&s;ideration of tho&s;e, who are more immediately con|cern'd</P>

<HEAD>POST-SCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>THE foregoing Pages were wrote, about two years &s;ince, with a De&s;ign to lett &s;ome of my Acquain|tance &s;ee my Notions concerning Paper-Curren|cy: It has been read by &s;everal in the Manu|&s;cript, and I have been told, that &s;ome Per&s;ons have ap|prov'd it. I have &s;een a Copy that has been tran&s;crib'd from it, but the Copy and Original are both very incor|rect; and to tell you the Truth, I have neither time nor Inclination at pre&s;ent, nor perhaps Capacity to amend it, &amp; I have no Friend that is capable, whom I am at pre&s;ent inclin'd to impo&s;e &s;o hard a Task upon, be&s;ides they have Bu&s;ine&s;s enough of their own. So that, Reader, thou mu&s;t be obliged to take it as it is: But the Author is willing, as all others are, to throw from him&s;elf as much blame as he can, therefore the Printer is to take care of the Propriety of the Paragraphs, where a Capital Letter ought to be, with the Orthography, Pointing, and all o|ther Trappings nece&s;&s;ary to plea&s;e the Reader, and im|belli&s;h the Work, &s;o that he is not to an&s;wer any thing for that. If it wants Ju&s;tne&s;s of Thought, or Ele|gance of Expre&s;&s;ion, he has no way to make you Amends, except laughing at him will do; tho' he is not fond of be|ing laugh'd at neither, unle&s;s you would offer &s;omewhat in its room, and give him an Opportunity of laughing in his Turn.</P>
<P>What he chiefly aimes at is this: He has two Things to offer to you in this <HI>Po&s;t&s;cript,</HI> the one is, <HI>the State of the Paper-Currency at pre&s;ent, with &s;ome Remarks thereon.</HI> And as he has &s;aid in the foregoing Pages, that Paper-Money in <HI>America</HI> will be an Advantage to <HI>Britain,</HI> he will offer one In&s;tance, among&s;t others, wherein he con|ceives it may be &s;o.</P>
<P>As to the pre&s;ent State of our Currency, there was a|bout two or three Years &s;ince a Law made to &s;tamp <HI>One Hundred and Six Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> in Paper-Bills, in or|der
<PB N="23" REF="040043_0023_1015CE806C989488">to exchange them for the old Bills, which are now i&s;|&s;uing out, the&s;e are declared by the Law to be a Legal Tender for all Debts, and is all that can be look'd upon to be a <HI>Legal Currency</HI> in this Province Be&s;ides the&s;e there were <HI>One Hundred and Four Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> &s;tampt in what we call <HI>Public Orders,</HI> and i&s;&s;ued out about two Years &s;ince, for the pre&s;ent Exigency. Of the&s;e Orders <HI>Twenty Seven Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> have already been burnt, and the Trea&s;urer has been ordered to get <HI>Thirteen Thou|&s;and Pounds</HI> more to burn this Se&s;&s;ion, &s;o that there &s;till remains 64,000 <HI>Pounds,</HI> which are to be &s;unk by a Fund, appropriated to that U&s;e in Seven Years from their i&s;&s;u|ing out. The&s;e Orders are only a Legal Tender to the Trea&s;urer, but the Publick gives 5 per Cent per Annum In|tere&s;t to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of them, &s;o that they pa&s;s as cur|rent as any other Money in the Province.</P>
<P>Now this is all the Paper Money that the Publick are concern'd in, when the old Bills, which are now exchanging, &s;hall be burnt. But be|&s;ides this there are <HI>Forty</HI> or <HI>Fifty Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> in Notes &s;tamp'd by the Merchants. For when about 4 or 5 Years &s;ince the Country was in great Streights for Want of Money, as Sett of Merchants and others joyn|ed together, and erected a &s;ort of Bank, &s;tamp'd Notes and let them out at Ten per Cent <HI>per Annum</HI> Intere&s;t, which Notes with our Orders and Bills will make between <HI>Two Hundred Thou&s;and</HI> and <HI>Two Hundred and Sixteen Thou&s;and Pounds,</HI> when the 13,000 are burnt.</P>
<P>This is the State of the Currency, as it now &s;tands, and notwith&s;tan|ding the Clamour and Noi&s;e again&s;t more Paper-Money, I do not find that any Man has had any Rea&s;on to complain, that he has been injur'd. And tho' we have now more than doubled our Legal Currency, by onr Orders and the Merchants Notes, yet this has had no Influence to pre|judice our Exchange, and I am &s;ure it has been to the Ea&s;e and Benefit of all &s;orts of Per&s;ons, except tho&s;e who wanted four or five times the Value of their Debts, as I have &s;aid before. Yet this is but palliating the Di&s;tember, and no Cure: For this Province is in as great Danger of having their Debts paid in Proclamation-Money one time or other, as ever, and that perhaps very &s;oon.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be loth, any thing that I &s;hall &s;ay here &s;hould put any body in a Way to bring it to pa&s;s: However, I will offer them a Scheme, how it may be done, (altho' I &s;uppo&s;e many of them know how to do it with|out Advice) but if it &s;hould put &s;ome in a Way how to bring it to pa&s;s, I hope it may put others on a Method how to prevent it. It may be done after this manner: Sink the Publick Orders, as the Law directs (which ought to be done) and then if the Bankers burn their Notes as they come
<PB N="24" REF="040043_0024_1015CE81F4E7ABB0">into their hands, this de&s;troys all but our Legal Paper-Bills, and if the Bankers &s;hould &s;ue their Bonds, that would call in 40 or 50,000 <HI>Pounds</HI> more, then will our Currency be reduc'd to 40 or 50,000 <HI>Pounds,</HI> when there are 30 or 40 Men in the Province, any one or two of whom can put that Sum into their Che&s;t whenever they plea&s;e: Now that they will do &s;o, I cannot &s;ay; but that Country is in a bad Condition, when it is in the Power of any two, three, or 40 Men, to bring it into &s;uch a Di|lemma, e&s;pecially when it &s;uits their Intere&s;t &s;o to do.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e it &s;hould lie in the Power of one &s;ingle Man to bring his to pa&s;s, we have nothing I think then but his Goodne&s;s to depend upon. I have been inform'd, that there is one Man in to this Province, who has 100,000 Pounds at Intere&s;t; if &s;o, he has the Command of almo&s;t all the Legal Money in the Province. Then I have been inform'd, there is a Lady, that has lately offer'd to give 40 000 Pounds in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> with her Daughter to any Man that &s;he likes, who will marry her. There are many others that have the Command of 40 or 50,000 Pounds. Now let any rea&s;onable Man judge, whether this Province does not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> at the Mercy of tho&s;e Per&s;ons, when&s;oever they plea&s;e. Or upon the whole, whether 200,000 Pounds this Currency, (which is but about 30,000 l. Sterling) &s;uppo&s;e it were all Legal Currency, can be &s;ufficient to carry on the Trade of a Place, who&s;e foreign Trade is upwards of 100,000 l. Sterling a Year.</P>
<P>I have hinted in the foregoing Pages, that Paper Money would tend much to the Advantage of <HI>Great Britain.</HI> I &s;hall here offer one Rea&s;on among&s;t others, why I apprehend it mu&s;t be &s;o</P>
<P>Paper-Money in <HI>America</HI> will always make <HI>England</HI> the Center of all the Silver that is brought into the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Dominions in <HI>America,</HI> and it will not only center in <HI>England,</HI> but abide there; the bringing it again to <HI>America</HI> will an&s;wer no Man's Account, for it will not pa&s;s where Bills are plenty, to purcha&s;e Produce among&s;t the Planters, except among&s;t a few, to the full Value thereof. Now I conceive it a va&s;t Advantage to any Prince in <HI>Europe,</HI> to have the Silver of his foreign Dominions center near him, this is keeping the Strength by him, and to have it rea|dy to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> on any Occa&s;ion. I might in&s;tance the Inconveniency the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are under, by rea&s;on, that the greate&s;t Part of their Riches are at &s;uch a Di&s;tance from them; but I am afraid of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> out of my Depth. Yet my Opinion is, that if the Currency in <HI>Briti&s;h America,</HI> with &s;ome other Things, were &s;ettled as I think they might be it would make the Engli&s;h Plantations of more Advantage to <HI>Great Britain</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> o|ther Parts of <HI>America</HI> can be to any other Prince in <HI>Europe</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> with all their Silver Mines, and would for ever &s;ecure their Dependency on <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
