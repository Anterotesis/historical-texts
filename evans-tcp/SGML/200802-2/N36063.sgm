<HEAD>THE FAIR SOLITARY, OR FEMALE HERMIT.</HEAD>
<P>AT a vi&s;it Alicia and &s;ome ladies of her acquaintance, paid Belinda at her country &s;eat, a motion was made to put the hor&s;es to the coach and take an airing. The &s;ea&s;on of the year admit|ted of getting out early, and their journey was to a meadow by a river &s;ide, with a large wood at the end. On one &s;ide of this wood was a pretty &s;teep rock, on the top of which &s;tood an hermitage, and at the foot of the rock ran a pretty broad &s;tream, which &s;eemed to forbid a farther pa&s;&s;age. This wa|ter ri&s;es from a torrent, which falls from the hill on the rocks. The murmuring noi&s;e it makes, to|gether with the natural ca&s;cades it forms, in the gloom of the wood, pre&s;ents the eye with as agree|able an entertainment as the mo&s;t cultivated &s;pot of ground can do.</P>
<P>"This is my u&s;ual walk, &s;ays Belinda, I like the &s;ilence of the place&mdash;It in&s;pires a &s;oothing melan|choly.
<PB N="4" REF="047094_0005_10224C1462D37F30">
Hither I often repair alone, or without any company but my thoughts."</P>
<P>"But do you never meet with the Hermit, and have you not yet ventured into his habitation?" &s;aid one of the ladies. "I have not had a &s;ight of him yet," an&s;wered &s;he.</P>
<P>Well, &s;aid Alicia, I love the&s;e hermits, and &s;hould be glad of a little talk with one of them. A way of life &s;o much out of the common cour&s;e makes me fancy, that they mu&s;t needs be either va&s;tly &s;u|perior to, or very much below other men.</P>
<P>Here the company alighted, and walked over a green, clo&s;e by the &s;ide of a brook. On going fur|ther they came to a place, where the tall poplars which grew on the banks of the river hung very much over, and by their bending, formed a kind of a bridge, at the foot of which appeared a &s;mall path in the rock, by which the a&s;cent was ea&s;y to the top; but whether made by nature, or contrived by art, is uncertain.</P>
<P>The ladies, guided by their curio&s;ity, followed this &s;mall track, and &s;oon got to the door of the hermitage. They &s;aw at the &s;ame time a tall hand|&s;ome woman ha&s;tily enter this rural habitation, and pull the wicket after her; upon which, &s;aid they, &s;ince women are admitted here, we may al&s;o claim the &s;ame right. Accordingly they knocked at the door, but nobody would an&s;wer. Continuing how|ever to make a loud noi&s;e, and giving thereby to under&s;tand that they would not be denied, the &s;ame per&s;on they had &s;een before, came out, and told them, that her little dwelling was not worthy the notice of ladies of their fa&s;hion. They made an|&s;wer, that their bu&s;ine&s;s was with the Hermit who lived there, and that they mu&s;t &s;ee him; upon which the woman, perceiving it would be in vain to make any further re&s;i&s;tance, opened the door, but at the
<PB N="5" REF="047094_0006_10224C17204CFF48">
&s;ame time told them that they would find nobody there but her&s;elf. The company &s;tepped in ha&s;tily, and having &s;oon looked over the little cottage, which was plain and homely, but neat, were indeed much &s;urprized to find no other per&s;on but the woman.</P>
<P>"Our curio&s;ity increa&s;es, &s;ays Belinda:&mdash;How can you live here by your&s;elf? What an odd &s;ort of life is this for a woman, and what could make you embrace it? The more I view you, the more my a&s;toni&s;hment increa&s;es. By your age and ap|pearance you &s;eem unfit for &s;o wild a dwelling, you might be an ornament to cities."&mdash;And indeed through a dejected air, and a &s;weet mode&s;t coun|tenance, &s;he di&s;covered much beauty. "Alas! re|plied the Solitary, I am unable to an&s;wer &s;uch compliments. I am almo&s;t a &s;tranger to the u&s;ual language of the world, neither have I, during four years abode in this retreat, &s;een or conver&s;ed with any human creature."&mdash;Who then &s;upplies you with the nece&s;&s;aries of life? a&s;ked they.&mdash;"A young woman, returned &s;he, who had an affection for me, would fain have accompanied me hither, but, hav|ing a family, &s;he could not leave it. However, &s;he is &s;ettled in a neighbouring town, whence &s;he brings me twice a week more than is &s;ufficient for the &s;upport of a life, which I wi&s;h I had, and which I ought to have lo&s;t long ago."</P>
<P>The&s;e words were followed by a flood of tears, which, together with her appearance and di&s;tre&s;s, &s;oon gained her the compa&s;&s;ion of her fair gue&s;ts. "In &s;eeing you, cried they, it is impo&s;&s;ible to avoid pitying you, whil&s;t the intere&s;t we take in your misfortunes intitles us to their recital. Let their cau&s;e be what it will, we &s;hall &s;till pity you. If you are wretched through the fault of others, we
<PB N="6" REF="047094_0007_10224C18B3C4B368">
will join in your re&s;entment; if by your own, for|tune only &s;hall be to blame, and you &s;hall never ap|pear guilty in our eyes."</P>
<P>"Your indulgence and good-nature, ladies, re|plied &s;he, will not reconcile me to my&s;elf. I have quitted the world to &s;hun my own being, but am &s;till always pre&s;ent to my&s;elf. I thought that, when I &s;hould no longer have witne&s;&s;es to my follies, I might then po&s;&s;ibly forgive and forget them.&mdash;But, mercile&s;s to my&s;elf, I am ever condemning and puni&s;hing them. The &s;ilence of the&s;e woods brings them fre&s;her to my mind, and adds new feel|ing to their &s;ting. Di&s;engaged from all things el&s;e, they alone are the employment of my whole lei&s;ure time."&mdash;"Perhaps, fair lady," re&s;umed Alicia, "it is an over delicacy only that makes you thus cruel to your&s;elf. However, you cannot well refu&s;e the recital of your misfortunes to people that already take &s;o large a &s;hare in them."</P>
<P>She would have excu&s;ed her&s;elf, but the ladies, who&s;e curio&s;ity was greatly rai&s;ed, a&s;&s;uring her they would not leave her till &s;he had acquainted them with her unfortunate hi&s;tory, &s;he began thus.</P>
<P>"Since, then, ladies, you in&s;i&s;t upon it, I &s;hall give you a plain narrative of my life, in which, though I may not have the merit of appearing in|nocent in your eyes, I &s;hall at lea&s;t have that of be|ing &s;incere.&mdash;I am born of a noble family. My father had the happine&s;s of having &s;erved his king and country well, in many important occa&s;ions, and enjoyed great places at court; but, meeting after|wards with &s;ome inju&s;tice in having a rival preferred to a po&s;e he thought his due, he grew highly di&s;|gu&s;ted. At that very time he had done the king of S&mdash;a con&s;iderable piece of &s;ervice, &s;o that, thinking all his obligations to his country, and an ungrateful prince, cancelled by the unju&s;t treatment
<PB N="7" REF="047094_0008_10224C1B2250FD08">
he had met with, he engaged in a rebellion that was rai&s;ed again&s;t him. As he had the chief command in a great province, it was an ea&s;y matter for him to bring about a change of ma&s;ters among&s;t the people of his government; he was very indifferent about making terms for him&s;elf. The &s;ervices he was doing the cau&s;e, and a large province he was &s;ubduing, were his ho&s;tages and &s;ecurities for the promi&s;es they made him, whil&s;t on our part we had nothing but bare words to depend upon. In the meanwhile all our e&s;tates and preferments were for|feited; in lien of which we had only fine promi&s;es, which were but indifferently performed. I was then very young, had lo&s;t my mother, and was the delight of my father. I had an only brother, &s;ome years older than my&s;elf, who went to the army with my father, and learned the art of war under his direction.</P>
<P>As for my&s;elf, I was to be &s;ent to one of tho&s;e hou&s;es that are de&s;tined for the education of young ladies, but the prince&s;s Zaide, who&s;e hu&s;band had formerly commanded in our province, being very intimate with my father, begged of him to leave me with her, which he con&s;ented to. This lady was fond of children, they were her chief diver&s;ion, and &s;he had but one &s;on. I was brought up with as much care as if I had been her own daughter: &s;he appointed me governe&s;&s;es and proper ma&s;ters, who cultivated all my good inclinations. She took a kind of plea&s;ure and amu&s;ement in dre&s;&s;ing me, and often gave little entertainments to the young children of my age. I had the good luck to plea&s;e in them, and always &s;trove to out do even what was thought <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> in the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The prince Camillus (that was her &s;on's name) was <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> years older than I. He had a noble and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">. We lived together, and whenever
<PB N="8" REF="047094_0009_10224C1CF7351A38">
he had done with his ma&s;ters, he would &s;eek my company with great fondne&s;s. In all his actions he gave me a remarkable preference over my com|panions. As I advanced in age, the graces, I am told, were not wholly unmindful of my per&s;on, and his liking to me increa&s;ed every day. I too early experienced the plea&s;ure of being loved, and found a &s;atisfaction in it. It is an unhappy thing to con|tract &s;uch an habit from our infancy.</P>
<P>Prince Camillus's friends had de&s;igned him for the duke of * * *'s daughter. Her name was Va|leria: &s;he was the heire&s;s of the family, &s;o that an ample fortune and di&s;tingui&s;hed titles made her a match worthy of him. He was often conducted to pay his court to her; &s;he likewi&s;e came to wait on the old prince&s;s, and we often met together at our little plays and entertainments. She was hand|&s;ome, and could not bear the remarkable preference our young lover gave me: in revenge &s;he would of|ten reflect with &s;corn and contempt on my fortune; but the prince's commendations and my gla&s;s made me perfectly ea&s;y; for I was already of an age to find a &s;atisfaction in being hand&s;ome.</P>
<P>His reluctance to vi&s;it the lady Valeria &s;oon grew remarkable. Hitherto we had lived together with|out any manner of con&s;traint, and his attachment to me had been looked upon as of no con&s;equence; but as it increa&s;ed every day, it began to grow &s;e|rious, and he was therefore forbid to enter my apartment.</P>
<P>His love quickened by this prohibition. He grew &s;ad and melancholy, and as he was of a hot and fiery temper, the re&s;traint that was laid upon his inclinations acted upon his health in &s;uch a man|ner, that he fell &s;ick. His mother was greatly a|larmed at the accident. Valeria came too &s;everal times to vi&s;it him, but he paid her regard with &s;o
<PB N="9" REF="047094_0010_10224C1FC6E390A8">
much coldne&s;s, that &s;he was prodigiou&s;ly nettled at the return. In the mean while his illne&s;s gamed &s;o much upon him, that other con&s;iderations were laid a&s;ide to apply to the &s;aving of his life. He was therefore allowed to &s;ee me, and I was accordingly conducted to his apartment by the women who had the care of me. The &s;ight of me had a &s;peedier effect upon him than all the art of the phy&s;icians, and his health returned in proportion to the liberty he had of being in my company. His mother, however, was revenged on me for the nece&s;&s;ity &s;he was reduced to of allowing an intercour&s;e, the con|&s;equences of which were &s;o much dreaded. She no longer retained the &s;ame tender friend&s;hip for me; the commendations that were be&s;towed on me, and with which &s;he was formerly &s;o well plea&s;ed, now grew offen&s;ive to her, and I was often puni&s;h|ed for being liked too much.</P>
<P>The prince, having at la&s;t perfectly recovered his health, became in a &s;hort time the mo&s;t accompli&s;h|ed lord in the court. He began now to a&s;&s;ume an air of haughtine&s;s and independence, and &s;light the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his ma&s;ters, but retained &s;till an infinite re&s;pect for his mother; though I was the limit of his obedience. He obeyed her in every thing ex|cept in what related to me.</P>
<P>At length &s;he expo&s;tulated the matter one day with him, and a&s;ked what he meant at la&s;t to do by his attachment for me? "Every thing, madam, an&s;wered he; for when I meet with birth, virtue and beauty in the object of my affections, I think I may, without blu&s;hing, own my pa&s;&s;ion and fur|ther intentions." So &s;mart and re&s;olute an an&s;wer made her tremble: &s;he repre&s;ented to him the great di&s;tance there was between him and me, the mis|fortunes of my family, the lo&s;s of our preferments, and the forfeiture of our e&s;tates; to all which he
<PB N="10" REF="047094_0011_10224C21EA451F08">
replied, "There fortune only is to blame, not &s;he; and may you not too, madam, be a little in fault, to &s;et &s;o high a value on that &s;ort of advantages which do not depend on us?"&mdash;"But, an&s;wered the prince&s;s, you find in Valeria both tho&s;e you are taken with, and the others you reproach me with making too great an account of." "Oh, madam! replied the young prince, my heart and your eyes are widely different in their judgments. You &s;ee, but I feel; and whatever inequality there is be|tween per&s;ons, love brings them all to a level."</P>
<P>The prince&s;s now &s;aw that there was no time to be lo&s;t, but that I mu&s;t be &s;ent out of the way, and accordingly I was put into a hou&s;e de&s;igned for a retreat from the world. The prince was no &s;ooner appri&s;ed of the news, but he flew to the place, and threatened the per&s;ons appointed for my keepers to have recour&s;e to the la&s;t extremities, if they did not produce me. His menaces were of no effect; they per&s;i&s;ted in their refu&s;al, and prote&s;ted they would let no body &s;ee me without an order from the prince&s;s, his mother. He went to her next, and &s;poke with a tran&s;port of heat, which offended her. He &s;aid, that he was not obliged to her for a life &s;he was endeavouring to make &s;o wretched; that the happine&s;s of his days would be to unite his fortune with mine, and that her power did not extend to an empire over the mind; and, upon her attempting to &s;et before him her authority and his duty, he told her &s;martly, that the heart had rights and dues of its own, apart from all others.</P>
<P>The prince&s;s was prudent: &s;he &s;aw it would be in vain to &s;truggle again&s;t the &s;tream: and therefore told <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> that &s;he would &s;acrifice her <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> to her regard for him, that &s;he looked upon him as a per&s;on out of order, who claimed her pity; but that he could not refu&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to be &s;ix month with|out
<PB N="11" REF="047094_0012_1022AA36ABD45258">
&s;eeing me, &s;ince &s;uch a compliance would co&s;t him the le&s;s, as the campaign was approaching, and he mu&s;t &s;et out to take upon him the command of the troops the king had thought &s;it to tru&s;t him with; and that &s;he was per&s;uaded the pa&s;&s;ion that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him, had not quite extingui&s;hed the love of glory in his &s;oul.&mdash;This, indeed, was true; ne|ver man enjoyed tho&s;e two &s;entiments in a higher degree; neither did the one in the lea&s;t take from the other.</P>
<P>He could not well deny the prince&s;s, but a&s;&s;ured her withal that his pa&s;&s;ion was not to be le&s;&s;ened by time, and that reflection, which never fails curing ordinary flames, would but increa&s;e his.</P>
<P>Whatever he could &s;ay to the contrary, &s;he was &s;till in hopes that time and ab&s;ence would do much for her, and therefore now bent her thoughts on endeavouring to divert one idea by another. She procured him a mo&s;t magnificent equipage, and pro|vided for his retinue the mo&s;t pompous attendants that could be found, and joined to the&s;e &s;everal old officers who had behaved be&s;t in the king's &s;ervice, to train him up to greatne&s;s. Nothing was for|gotten that might in&s;pire him with the love of glo|ry, and, as he had a va&s;t &s;hare of honour, he did not he&s;itate to embrace a cour&s;e &s;o much becoming his birth. He prepared therefore to &s;et out for the army, where his &s;en&s;e of glory was equalled by the &s;hining opportunities he had to pur&s;ue it.</P>
<P>A young man of merit who belonged to his re|tinue &s;oon became his confidant. He was born of a good family, and could take the liberty of often di&s;cour&s;ing him about his pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and pi|tying his being abandoned to a pa&s;&s;ion, which, as it di&s;tracted his mother, &s;o it might likewi&s;e ca&s;t a &s;tain upon his own reputation. Love, he told him, was not ju&s;tifiable in great men till they had paid
<PB N="12" REF="047094_0013_1022AA3A88CD6EE8">
the tribute due to glory, and that it might indeed be a &s;tate of pa&s;&s;age in the life of an hero, but that glory was a qualification that claimed a la&s;ting place therein. "De&s;cended from the blood you &s;pring from, continued he, and with the merit you po&s;&s;e&s;s, you have va&s;t expectations of courage and magna|nimity to an&s;wer."</P>
<P>This was in vain, he was not to be heard yet.&mdash;The prince was abandoned to a de&s;pair, from which every thing might be feared. He had often re|paired to the place of my confinement, and, not having been able to obtain a &s;ight of me, had with difficulty been withheld from the la&s;t violences.&mdash;His confidant Timander, who &s;oothed his angui&s;h by his gentlene&s;s, and the complai&s;ant di&s;charge of the tru&s;t he placed in him, promi&s;ed him at la&s;t to bring me a letter from him. Accordingly he wait|ed on the prince&s;s, and repre&s;ented to her, that it was nece&s;&s;ary to compound a little with the prince's grief; that were &s;he to in&s;i&s;t upon a &s;trict compli|ance with her orders, and exact obedience with too much rigour, &s;he might drive him to the greate&s;t extremities; that &s;he ought not to put her power in competition with the force of love, nor &s;et up her rights again&s;t tho&s;e of the heart, for neither were to be controuled by authority; that the prince ought to be pitied and diverted by &s;ome great object, without being made &s;en&s;ible of their de&s;ign; and that in exalted and haughty &s;ouls there were great re&s;ources to be found to work them to our ends. He concluded by acquainting her, that the prince had de&s;ired him to bring me a letter, that he was accordingly come to receive her orders, and that as to him&s;elf, &s;he might re&s;t a&s;&s;ured &s;he had nothing to fear from the confidence her &s;on placed in him.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="047094_0014_1022AA3C4BBF4B30">
The prince&s;s having yielded to the&s;e arguments, Timander came and found me melancholy and thoughtful. Your beauty, madam, &s;aid he, makes &s;trange work already. Is this the fir&s;t trial of your &s;kill? I gave him no an&s;wer, but what he could read in my confu&s;ed countenance and ba&s;hful looks. However, continued he, here is a letter the prince has ordered me to deliver into your hands.&mdash;I mu&s;t not take it, &s;aid I, and am extremely &s;orry for the effect, what you are plea&s;ed to call beauty, has had upon him. I know what I am, and at how great a di&s;tance the misfortunes of my family place me from him. I am bound by the ties of gratitude and re&s;pect to the prince&s;s, his mother; and if my eyes have had the misfortune to plea&s;e him, my heart has had no &s;hare in the de&s;ign. Therefore tell him I be&s;eech him to forget me. Timander here again pre&s;&s;ed me to receive the billet he had obtained leave to bring me; and the per&s;on who&s;e care I was under, bidding me take and read it, I accordingly opened it, and found the&s;e words:</P>
<P>"Nothing, madam, but the pa&s;&s;ion you have in|&s;pired in me can exceed the affliction I am under. Expre&s;&s;ions are too poor for what I feel. You are per&s;ecuted for my &s;ake, and your &s;ufferings alone cau&s;e all the tortures that di&s;tract me. I now di&s;|cover my love without di&s;gui&s;e or re&s;erve, a boldne&s;s I borrow from the innocence of my intentions;&mdash;and as every thing oppo&s;es my de&s;igns, my de&s;ires become the more inflamed, and my re&s;olutions the better confirmed. Are not you formed, madam, to be loved? In you I find all my excu&s;es.&mdash;When a man loves as much as I do, the greate&s;t plea&s;ure he can feel, is to find that he loves with the ju&s;te&s;t rea&s;on: and this, madam, is a &s;atisfaction I mu&s;t owe you all the moments of my life."</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="047094_0015_1022AA3EF953A0F0">
Well, madam, &s;ays Timander, will you not fa|vour us with an an&s;wer to this billet?&mdash;I do not think it at all proper, an&s;wered I.&mdash;Why &s;o, add|ed he, you are not forbid it?&mdash;My duty to my&s;elf, returned I, forbids it.</P>
<P>After an hour's conver&s;ation he took his leave, and de&s;ired to know what he &s;hould tell the prince? Tell him, &s;aid I, that I have a grateful heart, and am moved with his &s;orrow; but that, in the circum|&s;tances we are in, the be&s;t thing for him to do is, to think no more of me, and for me to forget him, if I can. He went back to the prince with this an&s;wer, which did not &s;eem to di&s;plea&s;e him.</P>
<P>Returning to my chamber, I read the prince's letter over again with a concern of tenderne&s;s, which would have given him the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction.&mdash;Not long after this me&s;&s;age, I heard he was upon his departure for the army. His mother had pro|cured him the mo&s;t &s;plendid equipage in the world, and purcha&s;ed him one of the fir&s;t po&s;ts in the army. She was, by this, opening a door to honours, and he was &s;etting out with di&s;tinction in the road to glory. Timander called once more upon me be|fore his departure, and brought this &s;econd letter.</P>
<P>"I am departing for the army, madam. I mu&s;t an&s;wer the call of glory to reach the throne of love, and become worthy of you. I therefore fancy you are the prize I am going to conquer.&mdash;But alas! love is not to be merited, and I mu&s;t abandon my|&s;elf to a grief worthy of your ab&s;ence and my heart. Do but think, madam, that I am without you: that will be &s;ufficient to de&s;erve your pity.&mdash;I would &s;acrifice my life to my evil &s;tars, but that I know it is con&s;ecrated to you, and love will claim an account of it at my hands."</P>
<P>Timander painted, in the livelie&s;t colours, the di&s;tre&s;s the prince was in. The picture affected me
<PB N="15" REF="047094_0016_1022AA4196D96938">
prodigiou&s;ly. I felt my bo&s;om rent by a thou&s;and different agitations. I thought my&s;elf va&s;tly in|debted to him: I had hopes, fears, and even de&s;ires; yet all the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions were not well di&s;tingui&s;hed in my &s;oul. I was flattered with the prince's love; but then again I was too much reminded of the di&s;tance between him and me. This &s;tartled my pride, and, when &s;elf-opinion took up the &s;cales to weigh our merits, I own I did not find my&s;elf &s;o va&s;tly beneath him. It is true, I might indeed have renounced an alliance I was made to buy at too high a price, but in the attempt the prince's love and di&s;tre&s;s &s;topped me &s;hort.&mdash;He was &s;acri|ficing his greatne&s;s to me, and I my pride to him. He had not been long in the army before he gave proofs of his bravery. In him courage was joined with a great &s;hare of &s;en&s;e and prudence (though the latter was &s;till confined to his head, and had not yet reached his heart) whil&s;t reading and re|flection &s;upplied his want of experience; all which gave rea&s;on to hope he would one day be a great general.</P>
<P>There was a great battle fought a few days after his arrival. The enemies finding them&s;elves hard pre&s;&s;ed in the po&s;t they occupied, and fearing to be attacked in their intrenchments, re&s;olved to be be|forehand with us. Accordingly having made all the previous di&s;po&s;itions to a battle, they fell upon us at a time, when by their &s;ituation we would have thought they &s;hould only have kept on the defen&s;ive. However, they came up like de&s;peradoes, determin|ed to &s;ell dearly their lives, and victory had long remained doubtful, when the left wing, which my father commanded, began at la&s;t to give way.&mdash;The prince, who was at the head of the infantry, flew immediately to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He found him wounded, fallen under his hor&s;e, and all about him
<PB N="16" REF="047094_0017_1022AA4428E9C140">
either dead, or put to flight. He ran to him, lift|ed him from the ground, re-mounted him on a &s;pare hor&s;e, bound up his wound with his handker|chief, and rallying the troops, charged bri&s;kly the enemy, routed them entirely, and obtained a com|plete victory, which co&s;t them all their artillery and baggage, be&s;ides a great number of pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>My father began to feel his hurt after he was out of the heat of the action, and was obliged to be carried to his tent, where the &s;urgeons &s;earched his wound, and found it very con&s;iderable. The fir&s;t thing he did was, to enquire after the per&s;on to whom he owed his life, and being told that it was the prince who had thus &s;aved him, he could not conquer his concern for being &s;o greatly obliged to him: is it po&s;&s;ible, &s;aid he, that I mu&s;t be &s;o infi|nitely in his debt? All the time of his illne&s;s, the prince never cea&s;ed his generous offices; he &s;ent for the mo&s;t eminent &s;urgeons to dre&s;s his wound; had his own officers to wait on him, and more than once offered him his pur&s;e, which he con&s;tantly re|fu&s;ed to accept. Word was &s;ent me of my father's wound, how I owed his life to the prince, and of all the kind offices he had received from him during his illne&s;s. On this, the infinite regard and affec|tion I had for &s;o dear a parent, made me think I might &s;end the prince my acknowledgements, with|out tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing again&s;t the rules of decency. Ac|cordingly, without con&s;ulting any body, I wrote him the following letter.</P>
<P>"I don't think I tran&s;gre&s;s the laws of decency, by thus expre&s;&s;ing the grateful &s;en&s;e of my obliga|tions to you for having pre&s;erved a life &s;o precious to me as is that of a father, whom I honour beyond all expre&s;&s;ion.&mdash;Alas! Sir, mu&s;t e&s;teem, gratitude, and natural &s;entiments all join to force a heart, which would have cho&s;en to yield only to its incli|nation
<PB N="17" REF="047094_0018_1022AA46B3F0BCD8">
and your tenderne&s;s? Fame is already wholly taken up with you. For this am I to thank glory alone, and mu&s;t not love claim &s;ome &s;hare of the debt?"</P>
<P>I feared a long while for my father's life; but at la&s;t he gave &s;ome hopes of a recovery, to ha&s;ten which he cau&s;ed him&s;elf to be carried into the coun|try, whither I followed immediately to wait on him, and employ my cares for a health that was &s;o dear to me.</P>
<P>The prince returned covered with glory. He often came in a friendly manner to vi&s;it my father, and I found him &s;till the &s;ame towards me as when we parted. I acknowledged the obligations I lay under, and the &s;entiments of gratitude he could claim from me; but the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions offended him. I mu&s;t have no returns but from your heart, &s;aid he: delicacy of &s;entiments is an attendant of love, which quickens all its plea&s;ures, though it often prepares us many vexations. But what mu&s;t be|come of me, if with &s;entiments &s;o natural, &s;o &s;trong, and &s;o fond as mine, you &s;hould not an&s;wer them, and I could in&s;pire you with nothing but thoughts of gratitude?&mdash;Yet, replied I, I mu&s;t not entertain any others.</P>
<P>There began now to be &s;ome talk of peace, and the prince, notwith&s;tanding his youth, held &s;o di&s;|tingui&s;hed a rank, that he was called into all the con&s;ultations held upon that &s;ubject. They ended at la&s;t in a general pacification, and the prince took particular care to have my father included in the treaty. Accordingly, by virtue of a general am|ne&s;ty, and a &s;eparate article for our family, our e&s;tates were to be re&s;tored to us as well as the places my father held before the war, which he was left at liberty either to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of again, or to accept of an equivalent in lieu thereof.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="047094_0019_1022AA4999CA18B8">
My father's health returned with the &s;atisfaction of once more &s;eeing his family in a flouri&s;hing con|dition. The peace occa&s;ioned an univer&s;al joy throughout the kingdom, and nothing was thought of at court, but the celebrating of it by fe&s;tivals and rejoicings. My father now left the country to take a hou&s;e in town, and &s;et up an equipage &s;uitable to his birth. As I was already pa&s;&s;ed my childhood, he took me home, but de&s;ired a lady of his acquaintance, who had lo&s;t her hu&s;band, and had &s;uffered from the frowns of fortune, to come and live with us, and have an eye over my conduct. Her name was Leonora: I was ordered to &s;how her as much obedience as if &s;he were my mother: &s;he had a great &s;hare of under&s;tanding, had &s;een the world, and took care that I did not &s;tir a &s;tep with|out her.</P>
<P>Very &s;oon after, I was pre&s;ented to the queen. Her maje&s;ty received me with great kindne&s;s, treat|ed me with di&s;tinction, and &s;aid very hand&s;ome things of my per&s;on.</P>
<P>The whole winter &s;ea&s;on was &s;pent in diver&s;ions. The queen was young, and had a ta&s;te for plea&s;ures. There was not an a&s;&s;embly but what &s;he was &s;o kind as to admit me into, and I &s;howed away with pretty good &s;ucce&s;s. Prince Camillus made likewi&s;e one at every ball that was given. He danced exceeding well; his per&s;on was above any lord's at court, and the glory he had acquired in the late campaign, &s;eemed to ca&s;t a new lu&s;tre on him. I had the &s;a|tisfaction of hearing him prai&s;ed, and he the plea|&s;ure of finding his choice univer&s;ally approved.&mdash;Whenever we were dancing together, bu&s;y whi&s;|perings behind us declared how every body agreed in pronouncing us made for one another.</P>
<P>The prince&s;s Valeria bore with impatience the figure I made at court, and the queen's kindne&s;s to
<PB N="19" REF="047094_0020_1022AA4D2F121C20">
me, but much more the prince's fondne&s;s. She fell into &s;o deep a melancholy, that I could not help pitying her condition. Her pa&s;&s;ion glowed in her eyes; a &s;ecret langour was &s;pread over her whole per&s;on; grief preyed upon her beauty; and, though Nature intended her fair, Love had now ordered it otherwi&s;e. She had hand&s;ome features, but a wan and pale look robbed them of all their charms.</P>
<P>She comforted her&s;elf by ea&s;ing her mind to a young relation who lived with her, and had her confidence. One day as I was walking in the pa|lace garden with Leonora, we e&s;pied the prince&s;s and her confidant entering into a pretty dark grove, upon which I propo&s;ed to my friend to follow them. Accordingly we &s;tept after, and entered a &s;ide alley next to that where &s;he was &s;itting with her com|panion. She &s;poke with heat enough to be heard. What, &s;aid &s;he, would you have me do with my&s;elf? I live but for him, and yet I &s;hall never gain his love.&mdash;Forgive him this piece of levity, &s;aid the other, he will &s;oon return to you. How? replied Valeria, you would have me not concerned at his u&s;age! And you call levity a natural pa&s;&s;ion which he cannot re&s;i&s;t! A pa&s;&s;ion, to which he &s;acrifices his love to me, his glory, his fortune, and all he owes to the be&s;t of mothers! My heart has too often found his excu&s;es: when we love, we forgive long; but you do not &s;ee him with eyes as intere&s;t|ed as mine. What cold in&s;en&s;ibility has he not &s;hown for my pains!&mdash;There is a kind of meanne&s;s in feeling and &s;uffering for tho&s;e that do not feel for us. I can no longer bear the rackings of my heart, and the &s;tinging reproaches of my pride; I mu&s;t, I will &s;ilence them, and fall upon &s;ome me|thod worthy of me. What may that be? an&s;wered her relation. Why, to retire forever from court,
<PB N="20" REF="047094_0021_1022AA4EB9808520">
replied &s;he;&mdash;She could not proceed further, a flood of tears interrupting her &s;peech.&mdash;Strange re&s;olu|tion! an&s;wered her confidante; you would puni&s;h your&s;elf, becau&s;e another is guilty! Here, night coming on, they withdrew.</P>
<P>I &s;eemed &s;o affected with the prince&s;s's affection, that Leonora could not help expre&s;&s;ing her &s;urprize. What! &s;aid &s;he to me, mu&s;t one enter into a rival's grief?&mdash;I never feared her, replied I, and, as I have had nothing to di&s;pute with her, I cannot now en|joy the ill-natured plea&s;ure of triumphing in her di&s;tre&s;s. The prince's heart was tendered me with|out my wi&s;hing or de&s;iring it; and therefore, as &s;he gives me neither fear nor unea&s;ine&s;s, I cannot hate her. I have &s;ome &s;hare of good-nature, and mu&s;t pity her condition.</P>
<P>At my return home I found one of the queen's gentlemen, who brought me word, that &s;he had en|gaged me to an entertainment the king was to give, on account of the marriage of the prince&s;s Flavia, one of her maje&s;ty's relations; that in ca&s;e I had not jewels enough, &s;he would &s;end me &s;ome, and de&s;ired to know what I might want. I told him I had a &s;uit of green velvet and gold, which would do very well with a &s;et of rubies, if I could get them. I withdrew afterwards to prepare my dre&s;s, and, out of complai&s;ance to her maje&s;ty, took more pains about it than otherwi&s;e I would have done.</P>
<P>The day appointed for this magnificent enter|tainment, was &s;pent in all manner of diver&s;ions.&mdash;There was a play acted in the evening, which was followed by a grand &s;upper and a ball; and nothing in the world could be more gallant and better con|ducted. The prince&s;s Flavia looked perfectly charming: for, though &s;he is not a regular beauty, &s;he has &s;o much youth and bloom, with &s;o beautiful
<PB N="21" REF="047094_0022_1022AA504813BBD8">
a colour, that &s;he may &s;urpa&s;s others hand&s;omer than her&s;elf.</P>
<P>About the middle of the ball there was a great &s;tir at the door, which engaged the attention and eyes of the whole company. It was the duke of Praxede who was ju&s;t arriving from the army. His coming was quite unexpected; he had made a &s;hining campaign, had beaten the enemy, and en|tered the room with an air of confidence, &s;upport|ed by his natural valour and good mein. I had never &s;een him before: he was not better acquaint|ed with me; and, in ca&s;ting his eyes towards me, I heard him &s;ay &s;ome very fine things. His words, his looks, and the very found of his voice threw my &s;oul into an agitation, which I had never felt before. The prince and he were then at variance; they were both driving towards the &s;ame goal, and each other's rival in glory and merit; upon which account they had been &s;eparated, and the court had not thought fit to employ them both in the &s;ame army.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he arrived, the prince&s;s Flavia offered him her hand to dance: he took me next, but I was &s;o confu&s;ed, that had I dared, I would have refu&s;ed his civility.</P>
<P>All the time the ball la&s;ted, he kept his eyes con&s;tantly on me: I turned mine from him, and would fain refu&s;e him my looks, as a favour he had no right to. However, he took me &s;everal times to dance, and made him&s;elf &s;o remarkable, that it was thought he did it on purpo&s;e to &s;pite the prince. You may be &s;ure I had no &s;hare in the de&s;ign, and indeed, as &s;oon as the ball was over, I ran home in great ha&s;te, and the prince left the company to conduct me.</P>
<P>"Your charms, madam, &s;aid he, (when at liber|ty to &s;peak) operate on every body, and the duke
<PB N="22" REF="047094_0023_1022AA540E8479F8">
of Praxede comes to &s;well the number of your con|que&s;ts. Indeed, Sir, replied I, his affecting to take me &s;o often to dance, and his &s;taring at me, has given me a great deal of unea&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;But why &s;o, madam? an&s;wered he. So much care, never to ca&s;t a look towards him, &s;hows that you dreaded his eyes, and was diffident of your own. A per&s;on that feels nothing, is always free and open; and over-acting our part, on certain occa&s;ions, often betrays a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of not being always right. But, replied I, what would you quarrel with me about? I never &s;aw him before in my life.&mdash;That may be, an&s;wered he again, but he has &s;een you, and you were hand&s;omer than u&s;ual to-day: nay, he loves you, and that alone, even though you were not guilty, is enough to make me wretched."</P>
<P>Ever after this the prince watched me with a caution that gave me offence. The duke on his part followed me every where, and I always found him ready to catch my looks in all public places. The prince was informed of all his &s;teps; he be|came peevi&s;h and &s;u&s;picious, and, though he could lay nothing to my charge, yet he was not &s;atisfied with me. He thought the duke very in&s;olent to pretend to a per&s;on, to whom he had been &s;o long engaged; but for my part, I own I fancied he wanted only to teaze and alarm the prince, and be|lieved, that, he thought if I could not &s;erve the purpo&s;e of his heart, I might at lea&s;t gratify his vanity. Such a notion was highly offen&s;ive to me, and therefore I &s;hunned him carefully. The prince him&s;elf took notice of this; whereupon I opened my mind to him one day, telling him I could not believe I was any ways concerned in his grief, &s;ince, were it &s;o, it would be doing me the highe&s;t in|ju&s;tice; to which he an&s;wered, "You do not in|deed &s;eem to join with the duke again&s;t me; you
<PB N="23" REF="047094_0024_1022AA56996C8B80">
avoid him, and &s;how me even a greater regard than ever, and yet you are guilty: nay, you are &s;o with|out knowing it, and you would fain, by an in|crea&s;e of kindne&s;s, make amends for the wrongs you are doing me.&mdash;Good Heavens, cried I, what then is my crime!&mdash;You love the duke, an&s;wered he: yes, Mademoi&s;elle, you doat on him, and 'tis I that mu&s;t inform you thereof. I know I am going to appear whim&s;ical and ridiculous, and ju&s;tify all your wrongs. I provide you with weapons again&s;t my&s;elf, which you will turn to a proper u&s;e. I &s;ee and feel the whole of my wretchedne&s;s, but I am driven to it." All this was attended by a flood of tears, and taking leave he told me further, that he was going to conceal his di&s;traction and de&s;pair from my &s;ight.</P>
<P>He left me in a greater confu&s;ion than I can well de&s;cribe: I found I wanted to &s;hake off my|&s;elf, and dur&s;t not yet enquire into the cau&s;e of the various emotions I felt rai&s;ed in my brea&s;t; when having thrown my&s;elf on a couch, Leonora entered the room.</P>
<P>I was &s;urprized at her coming, and a&s;hamed &s;he &s;hould be witne&s;s of my di&s;order. Which &s;he per|ceiving, Come, &s;aid &s;he, recover your&s;elf: I &s;ee you would conceal your unea&s;ine&s;s and &s;entiments from my knowledge; but you are to blame. Don't take me for a &s;evere cen&s;or, that would condemn all your motions, but look upon me as a friend on whom you may depend, and one capable of comforting and conducting you in the mo&s;t delicate circum|&s;tance of your life. Do not fancy I &s;hall make a crime of your &s;en&s;ibility. A heart may be &s;en&s;ible and innocent too; and, to merit your confidence, by my example, I am willing to let you into mine. Here &s;he pau&s;ed a while, and &s;eemed to repent hav|ing gone &s;o far; but I pre&s;&s;ed her with &s;o much
<PB N="24" REF="047094_0025_1022AA592C694340">
tenderne&s;s to proceed in her &s;tory, that &s;he con|tinued thus:</P>
<P>I am acquainted with love, and have but too dearly paid the tribute due to that little god.&mdash;You have no doubt heard of the misfortunes of my family, and how I lo&s;t my hu&s;band and brother both at the &s;ame time. The one was the &s;upport, and the other the hope of our hou&s;e. My brother was taken in arms again&s;t his &s;overeign, and left his head upon a &s;caffold. Soon after my hu&s;band paid with his life a victory he gained over the enemies of the &s;tate. Thus was I in one moment &s;tript of all my pre&s;ent advantages and hopes to come; re|duced to lament a dead hu&s;band in place, and much e&s;teemed, and to &s;ue for a brother's life and honour. But alas! he forfeited both together, with his e&s;|tates, &s;o that I was left without wealth or fortune. The notions of greatne&s;s di&s;appeared, and all the charms that are the attendants of a di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;tation in life, vani&s;hed in an in&s;tant. I found my|&s;elf for&s;aken and without &s;upport, and my only hopes were, that, having been expo&s;ed to the frowns of fortune, I &s;hould at lea&s;t be forgotten by love; but both joined forces to per&s;ecute me. Di&s;pen&s;e me, madam, with the re&s;t&mdash;</P>
<P>And now, ladies, though every thing &s;he &s;aid is &s;till fre&s;h in my memory, from my having been ve|ry attentive to this mark of confidence &s;he gave me (wherein &s;he acted very artfully to come at my heart and &s;ecret) yet as &s;he is unknown to you, the repetition will not perhaps be thought very mate|rial, therefore you will give me leave to drop her hi&s;tory here&mdash;By no means, &s;aid we all, pray let us know the re&s;t of Leonora's adventures: where|upon the Solitary continued in the&s;e words:</P>
<P>&mdash;We like to be let into the weakne&s;&s;es of peo|ple we e&s;teem. We always long to re&s;emble them
<PB N="25" REF="047094_0026_1022AA5BB7CA70B0">
in &s;omething; if their eminent qualities leave <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> far behind, their foibles bring us to a nearer <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. That is no &s;mall comfort, and in my particular cir|cum&s;tance, it was too important for my repo&s;e, to find a friend in a per&s;on who had been &s;et as a watch over my actions. The confidence &s;he was going to place in me, was a kind of &s;ecurity that an&s;wered for her, and I was in tho&s;e moments, when a &s;ecret lies &s;o heavy on the heart. I longed to &s;peak to her of what I felt, and was too happy to find in her, not only advices for my conduct, but the &s;ame dear weakne&s;&s;es which render us more indulgent towards tho&s;e of other people. I pre&s;&s;ed her there|fore to proceed.</P>
<P>You will then, &s;aid &s;he, have the full extent of my &s;ecret. I am very much afraid the recital will make all my wounds bleed afre&s;h, and give new life to my pa&s;&s;ion; but however, that &s;hall not prevent my complying with your reque&s;t. My &s;entiments being the only plea&s;ure left me, I will indulge them in their full career. They are indeed of a quite new nature. Olindo in Ta&s;&s;o is quoted as a model of &s;entiments. He is made to &s;ay, that he de&s;ires much, hopes little, and a&s;ks nothing; but for my part I neither wi&s;h, hope, nor a&s;k at all. My pa&s;|&s;ion is &s;upported by nothing; it &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, feeds, and increa&s;es by it&s;elf: and thus have I for a long time been taken up with a &s;entiment mo&s;t &s;ingular in its kind.</P>
<P>I &s;aw at a friend's &s;ome years ago, the count * * *, you will excu&s;e me telling his name. To me he appeared a mo&s;t amiable per&s;on, though, with &s;o great &s;hare of the qualifications of the mind, per&s;onal advantages would be le&s;s requi&s;ite. From the fir&s;t moment I beheld him he engaged my at|tention, (which is doing a great deal with me)
<PB N="26" REF="047094_0027_1022AA5F8DEC7018">
and I continued &s;eeing him both at my friend's and my own hou&s;e. There was at that time a gentle|man that laid &s;ome preten&s;ions to my heart. We had formerly been on the point of marriage, and, when my family had di&s;po&s;ed of my liberty in fa|vour of my late hu&s;band, he had been afflicted be|yond expre&s;&s;ion. His &s;tars had decreed he &s;hould ever love me; therefore, unable yet to re&s;olve to give me over, he &s;till diverted his &s;orrow with the notion that my heart did not go along with my hand. His e&s;teem and re&s;pect for me had indeed &s;topped and repre&s;&s;ed his &s;entiments, but he was ever watching mine, and telling me every day, that if I di&s;po&s;ed of them to another, he &s;hould die with grief.</P>
<P>He &s;oon ob&s;erved, that my regard for the count was changing into tenderne&s;s; my eyes had inform|ed again&s;t me, and revealed my &s;ecret: and upon this he vented him&s;elf in reproaches that very much offended me.</P>
<P>All this was yet unperceived by the happy man. Not but that he &s;eemed to have &s;ome &s;lender incli|nation for me, and I was ready prepared to reject his declaration, if he &s;hould make any. He has &s;ince been fully revenged for my idle re&s;olution.&mdash;If he had any &s;entiments at all, they have &s;topt &s;hort, whil&s;t mine have had their full run. It was long before I could be clear in what I felt. Hea|vens! how artfully doth the heart in tho&s;e ca&s;es conceal its inclination, not to alarm our rea&s;on and mode&s;ty? It is a bare nothing at fir&s;t: it is the mind we are taken with; and, in &s;hort, till love has got the ma&s;tery, he remains almo&s;t always un|known. He &s;oon di&s;covered him&s;elf to me in all his power; and the di&s;order, which the pre&s;ence of the count always threw me into, made me &s;en&s;ible of my defeat.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="047094_0028_1022AA63A89655C8">
About that time all my misfortunes came &s;hower|ing upon me, and, as I have told you, I lo&s;t my hu&s;band and brother. It was the mo&s;t complete and &s;tronge&s;t felt di&s;tre&s;s in the world. My friend, who often came to comfort me, u&s;ed to bring the count with her at a time when I &s;aw no body; and I found, to the &s;hame of my grief, that he alone was able to &s;u&s;pend it.</P>
<P>I was afterwards plunged into a world of affairs; my family ruined; my brother peri&s;hing with all the infamy of guilt and rebellion, and none but I to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, and &s;ave all I could out of the ruins of the family. I was in hopes that &s;o many trou|bles would at lea&s;t wear out the &s;entiment I nou|ri&s;hed in my heart, but my misfortunes ever kept up a &s;trong remembrance of it.</P>
<P>After many years vexation, time, without the help of rea&s;on, effected what the latter had not been able to compa&s;s; for we mu&s;t own, to the &s;hame of our affliction, that it doth not la&s;t forever. In &s;hort, having made the mo&s;t of the wrecks of my fortune, I hoped to enjoy a little quiet. But I had lo&s;t the repo&s;e of the heart, and, when re&s;tored to my&s;elf, I found I was wholly &s;unk in love. An active hurrying life had, indeed, encroached on its rights; but I have paid dear for it &s;ince. I could no longer mi&s;take my &s;ituation; I was forced to own it, and begin to &s;ettle with my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t women, void of thought or de&s;ign of action, are hurried away by the fir&s;t &s;entiment that plea&s;es them. But for my part I con&s;idered what I had to do, and, after weighing the count's character and my own, found that I mu&s;t ab&s;olutely avoid him: and, to &s;how you that my re&s;olution was grounded on knowledge, I will draw you his pic|ture.&mdash;But no: I am not in a condition to paint him &s;uch as he is. Love would needs conduct the
<PB N="28" REF="047094_0029_1022AA611739EC40">
pencil, and I could not &s;uffer any want of merit in the object of my affections.</P>
<P>But, &s;aid I, interrupting her, how is it po&s;&s;ible that with a heart, overflowing with &s;o great a pa&s;|&s;ion, you &s;hould have made no attempts towards ei|ther in&s;piring the &s;ame in his, or expre&s;&s;ing your own to him?&mdash;I have my an&s;wer ready, replied &s;he.</P>
<P>I was born with a heart greatly &s;u&s;ceptible of tenderne&s;s, but yet at the &s;ame time with a deal of pride. The one cannot be gratified but at the ex|pen&s;e of the other. To make me happy, they ought both to agree, which is a difficult matter; and my condition is &s;till more mi&s;erable when my glory is wounded, than when my heart bleeds; and I have therefore re&s;olved to gratify it. Had I &s;hown my &s;entiments, and they been &s;lighted, I &s;hould have died with grief; and that was my rea&s;on for avoid|ing him. I was &s;ure of my lips, but could not an|&s;wer for my eyes; and yet, whil&s;t I was &s;hunning his looks, I was ever &s;eeking for them. What &s;torm would they not rai&s;e in my &s;oul, when my eyes happened to glance on him! My tenderne&s;s and pride always &s;tepped in between him and me. The one forced me towards him, the other with|held my fondne&s;s; and the&s;e different impre&s;&s;ions gave me a confu&s;ed and ba&s;hful air, which I was afraid might betray me. Yet there is not one mo|ment of my life, wherein my heart doth not require, and I refu&s;e him to its eager de&s;ires. My &s;enti|ments are as violent now, as when new; and more than once an increa&s;e of tenderne&s;s has exhau&s;ted the whole &s;tock of courage I had collected by re|flection. My thoughts are &s;till on him without in|termi&s;&s;ion. He falls in between every object and me; in all the projects I form, I have him &s;till in view: I fancy his e&s;teem is to be the reward of all the good I do, and I prize it yet more than all the
<PB N="29" REF="047094_0030_1022AA65336E07E8">
tender &s;entiments I am able to &s;uppo&s;e in him. I have &s;et my&s;elf the harde&s;t ta&s;k in the world, a &s;trictne&s;s of behaviour that denies me even the plea|&s;ures of imagination; but e&s;pecially, I have pro|mi&s;ed to avoid him, and accordingly keep my word with my&s;elf.</P>
<P>One heart alone is unequal to &s;o mighty a &s;trug|gle; and a friend who vi&s;ited me often, &s;eeing me pen&s;ive and melancholy, at la&s;t wre&s;ted my &s;ecret from me. The confe&s;&s;ion co&s;t me as much as if it had been &s;omething criminal. He endeavoured to quiet my timorou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;aid&mdash;Do you think we owe as much fidelity to this whim of honour im|po&s;ed by cu&s;tom, as to the other which is the real attendant of virtue? Believe me, madam, the world is not too hard, you owe it but the appearances of decorum, no more is required of you.&mdash;I cannot be of your way of thinking, an&s;wered I, and I have never met with a woman good for any thing, after once throwing off the prejudice of honour. Be+&s;ides, I have more regard for my&s;elf than for the world: I &s;tand in need of my own good opinion, and the te&s;timony of my con&s;cience is more nece&s;|&s;ary to me, than all the &s;uffrages of the public.&mdash;But will you, &s;aid he again, fall a &s;acrifice to your pa&s;&s;ion? You mu&s;t either get the better of, or yield to it.&mdash;If my heart could have obeyed me, replied I, I &s;hould have got rid of it long ago, but I can bring it to no manner of terms. Nay, &s;carce can I forgive my &s;en&s;ibility, and it is you that have re|called me to the attention I owe my&s;elf.</P>
<P>But after all, madam, an inclination is not a thing that depends on us; it in&s;inuates into our hearts without our leave: pa&s;&s;ions &s;eize and hold us in their power as long as they plea&s;e, and the whole guilt lies in the u&s;e we make of them. What
<PB N="30" REF="047094_0031_1022AA69E7BB95C8">
have I not done to tear him from my heart? I at|tempted to leave my native country, and go over to a foreign court. I thought change of place and objects, might give a new turn to my ideas; but love, more diligent than me, flew and overtook me on the road. Seeing therefore, that all my precau|tions were u&s;ele&s;s, and my affairs requiring my pre|&s;ence at home, I returned back. Next I endea|voured to force my&s;elf into a liking to &s;ome per&s;ons that made their addre&s;&s;es to me, hoping to weaken one pa&s;&s;ion by another, and thus at la&s;t to give them both the &s;lip. But alas! all to no purpo&s;e. I have &s;acrificed every thing to my imaginary love, and my fidelity to this phanta&s;m of a pa&s;&s;ion, is proof again&s;t all. It is really wonderful what lengths I have gone with this mere idea. I have per&s;onalized it, &s;o that I keep a &s;ocial intercour&s;e with it; nay, we have our quarrels and reconcilia|tions: at other times again we are upon ea&s;ier terms, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, my melancholy being then more &s;oothing, I <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">uld not barter it for the highe&s;t gratifications of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ea&s;ure. It is love alone that can give tho&s;e en|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">earing fits of &s;adne&s;s which we enjoy with thanks. My ideas are &s;o &s;trong, that there are moments when I fancy him near me, and love wears away the whole &s;pace that &s;eparates us.</P>
<P>Would you know what has led me to this exce&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion? It is my extreme &s;everity to my&s;elf.&mdash;It is not tho&s;e that yield, who love mo&s;t, but tho&s;e who re&s;i&s;t. All you deny the &s;en&s;es, adds to the hoard of tenderne&s;s. I was let loo&s;e to the exag|gerations of my mind, and, as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;eldom furni&s;hes all the gratifications our de&s;ires lend it, I have loved not in proportion to the merit I have found, but to that which I imagined.</P>
<P>I heard much, about that time, that the count had an affair with a lady; a new addition to my
<PB N="31" REF="047094_0032_1022AA6B7232D480">
grief, My pa&s;&s;ion, I fancied, gave me a right over his. When we love dearly, we would fain be loved again, and always fancy our&s;elves worthy of &s;uch a return. I was as much piqued at his amour, as if he had really been guilty of an infidelity to me, and his affection for another rai&s;ed a barrier be|tween him and me. From his engagement he &s;hifted to another. From thence I fancied he was incon&s;tant, and neither &s;erious nor re&s;pectful of love, and I found I was doomed to the laborious ta&s;k of effacing from my heart a &s;entiment that was deep|ly engraven in it. But alas! even now, a hundred times a day I &s;ay I will forget him, and &s;ay it, but to think &s;till more of him. What mu&s;t I do with the va&s;t &s;tock of love thus &s;welling in my heart?&mdash;Lovers are often cured by reflections; but mine di&s;temper me the more, and rea&s;on is too weak to a&s;&s;i&s;t me again&s;t my pa&s;&s;ion.&mdash;But it is too much expatiating upon what I feel. What, madam, mu&s;t you now think of me? Or what impre&s;&s;ions does my madne&s;s make upon you?&mdash;Think! replied I, why, that it is a &s;ort of con&s;olation to find &s;o e&s;ti|mable a per&s;on as you, in &s;ome &s;hape, partaking of my weakne&s;s.&mdash;</P>
<P>After all this, now &s;uffer me, madam, re&s;umed &s;he, to do my office, (for it is what we mu&s;t do &s;ometimes) by de&s;iring you to con&s;ider, that, though I have not fallen into the greate&s;t precipi|ces of love, I have neverthele&s;s been exce&s;&s;ively mi&s;|erable. From a conduct tolerably laudable, what advantages have I reaped? My&s;elf the only wit|ne&s;s of &s;o many difficulties and &s;trugglings. In love every thing of this nature is lo&s;t, becau&s;e un|known, be&s;ides that the heart is never well com|po&s;ed again after having been once agitated with that pa&s;&s;ion. How amiable and de&s;irable is virtue, even barely with regard to our repo&s;e! Take the
<PB N="32" REF="047094_0033_1022AA6E08595FF8">
mo&s;t fortunate pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;um up, if po&s;&s;ible, all the alarms, the pangs, the anxieties, the fears, the jealou&s;ies that attend them: lay all the&s;e a&s;ide, and leave to love none but its pure joys; how few will they appear? Yet, for the &s;hadow of the&s;e few plea&s;ures, we vitiate our ta&s;te, and lo&s;e the reli&s;h of true plea&s;ures for all our lives. Pardon, madam, this &s;mall touch of morality. If, by laying my&s;elf open to you as I have now done, I have forfeited the privilege of giving advice, I hope by a mutual confidence to regain a new right to your heart, and make my&s;elf believed a friend free from &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>Here I was going, in return, to unbo&s;om my &s;oul to her, in full liberty, in regard to my &s;itua|tion, when we were told that my father wanted us. Having waited on him, he a&s;ked me in a rough angry tone, what I had done to prince Camillus? "His mother has been telling me this moment, continued he, that he grieves mo&s;t terribly, and you are taxed with being the cau&s;e of it: it is very cutting, &s;ays &s;he to me, fir&s;t to bear &s;o much again&s;t my will, my &s;on's pa&s;&s;ion for your daughter, and then to find that very pa&s;&s;ion &s;erves but to make him unhappy. I believe you too much my friend, not to join with me in breaking an engagement which is not at all agreeable to me, and you are too much a man of honour not to think rather of ful|filling the duties of gratitude, than of aggrandizing your family at the expen&s;e of the friend&s;hip you owe me. Since, therefore, your daughter helps us by her ill-treatment of my &s;on, let us, concluded &s;he, complete a rupture, which we dur&s;t not have attempted without her concurrence; and for this purpo&s;e I beg of you to carry, or &s;end her down into the country. I an&s;wered, that I de&s;ired her to be per&s;uaded that no intere&s;ts were dearer to me than her own; that I had nothing more at heart
<PB N="33" REF="047094_0034_1022AA7096A69D50">
than to give her &s;atisfaction, and that I &s;hould im|mediately order you away. Therefore, Mademoi|&s;elle, get your&s;elf ready to &s;et out for my country &s;eat in two or three days. The gratitude and fi|delity I owe the prince&s;s prevent my talking to you in the &s;train of an offended father, but I had rather &s;erve her than you. Certainly, pur&s;ued he, turning to Leonora, who had followed me, no|thing can come up to my daughter's ingratitude to an amiable prince, who has a violent pa&s;&s;ion for her, who &s;acrifices the greate&s;t advantages to his love, and is the &s;upport of our tottering family. When the prince&s;s, his mother, out of indulgence to him and kind regard to me, is going to give a con&s;ent which co&s;ts her &s;o much, &s;he, my daughter, alone rai&s;es an ob&s;tacle to an affair, which the ought to buy at the expen&s;e of half her life!&mdash;Oh! in &s;pite of re&s;olution, I &s;hall lo&s;e my temper, anger re&s;umes its rights, and will have vent! Begone, and never more appear in my &s;ight." I would have an&s;wered, but he was too much exa&s;perated, and I found the be&s;t way was to withdraw imme|diately to my chamber. Leonora &s;taid however &s;ome time behind, to try to pacify him, but his pa&s;&s;ion ran &s;o high, and his rage was &s;o violent, that &s;he found it a hard matter to calm him.</P>
<P>That very moment the prince came to pay him a vi&s;it, and finding him prodigiou&s;ly ruffled, a&s;ked him the rea&s;on of his di&s;compo&s;ure: "My daugh|ter, replied the old gentleman, has been unhappy enough to di&s;plea&s;e you, for which I cannot pun|i&s;h her too much, and therefore have ju&s;t now or|dered her away into the country." The prince immediately threw him&s;elf at his feet to beg I might be allowed to &s;tay, but my father replied, that his word was too &s;trongly engaged to the prince&s;s ever to go from it. The prince a&s;&s;ured
<PB N="34" REF="047094_0035_1022AA736831DB20">
him I was no ways guilty: "Mu&s;t parents, &s;aid he, interfere in the quarrels of lovers, which have often no other foundation but their delicacy? It is I, &s;ir, that am in fault. Love is never &s;atisfied, and often unju&s;t. But at lea&s;t give me leave to &s;ee your daughter.&mdash;You have it, my lord, replied my father.&mdash;Well, then, continued the prince, I will go to my mother, and entreat her to de&s;ire you her&s;elf to break off this cruel journey.&mdash;Were &s;he even to order it, an&s;wered my father, it would be all to no purpo&s;e. She might think you and I are of a party in it; and I owe more to my honour than to any con&s;ideration whatever."</P>
<P>Leonora had withdrawn, when &s;he &s;aw the prince enter my father's clo&s;et, though not &s;o far but &s;he overheard this part of their conver&s;ation, after which &s;he came up to my room, where &s;he found me &s;inking under a dejection of &s;pirits that cannot be expre&s;&s;ed. "O my dear, cried I, my father's anger di&s;tracts me; but what afflicts me mo&s;t is, that he is not angry without a cau&s;e. Alas! but a moment ago you were talking of the trials of love: could I have thought I was de&s;tined to be &s;o &s;oon an in&s;tance of them?" Leonora on this re|peated to me what the prince had &s;aid to my father, but his genero&s;ity and virtue &s;erved only to add to my guilt and affliction.</P>
<P>The prince that moment entered my room, and finding me drowned in tears;&mdash;Though I am ig|norant of the cau&s;e of tho&s;e tears, &s;aid he, and dare not flatter my&s;elf they are meant for me, yet, madam, you are afflicted, and that is a &s;ufficient motive for me to partake in your &s;orrow.&mdash;My lord, replied I, abandon a wretched creature that di&s;turbs the tranquillity of your family: do not add your con&s;tancy to my load of misfortunes. You have already done too much for me and it is time
<PB N="35" REF="047094_0036_1022AA7704B68718">
to think of your&s;elf, and what you owe the prin|ce&s;s your mother.&mdash;Why will you, madam, an&s;wer|ed he, ever take upon you the care of my duty? It no longer becomes you to affect &s;uch a genero&s;|ity. This la&s;t &s;peech offended me.&mdash;What, &s;ir, do you mean by this, &s;aid I, and what am I accu|&s;ed of?&mdash;I accu&s;e you of nothing, replied the prince, and you will never find a per&s;ecutor in me. In the piques of lovers, the delicacy of the per&s;on in fault is always &s;ufficient revenge to the injured; I a&s;k no other: but at lea&s;t, Mademoi&s;elle, help us not to lo&s;e you. I have not been able to prevail with your father. It is the fir&s;t time in my life I have &s;een him angry with you, and I mu&s;t die with grief, if he continues much longer in the &s;ame temper.</P>
<P>Here I was told that one of the prince&s;s Flavia's gentlemen wanted to &s;peak with me. He brought me word that her highne&s;s had engaged me for a party of hunting the next day. I de&s;ired Leonora to go and know my father's plea&s;ure what I mu&s;t do. His an&s;wer was&mdash;To be &s;ure &s;he mu&s;t obey the prince&s;s: &s;ince &s;he has done her the honour to name her for the party, &s;he ought to go.&mdash;I there|fore &s;ent the gentleman back with my thanks to the prince&s;s, and to a&s;&s;ure her I would not fail to com|ply with her orders.</P>
<P>I was now obliged to get my things ready and think of my dre&s;s, but indeed I was very little di&s;|po&s;ed for joy. One of the inconveniencies of a court is, that we mu&s;t have the &s;entiments that reign there, or do as if we had them; &s;o that, of ten under an outward appearance of mirth, the inward angui&s;h of the heart is concealed.</P>
<P>I joined the company the next day&mdash;a very heavy heart, but di&s;&s;embled my unea&s;ine&s;s by &s;aying I had had a violent head-ache. Nothing in the world could be more gallant than our hunting match,
<PB N="36" REF="047094_0037_1022AA788F1A6CB0">
which was to conclude with an entertainment at a plea&s;ure &s;eat in the country. The ladies made a very fine appearance on hor&s;eback. My father, who neglected nothing that could give an addition of graces to my per&s;on, had made me learn to ride, and my dre&s;s was blue, trimmed with gold. I was liked better than I could have wi&s;hed, and the prince&s;s, who was very obliging, complimented me upon it in the hand&s;ome&s;t manner in the world.&mdash;The fir&s;t per&s;ons my eyes glanced on were the prince and the duke, very regularly paying their court to her highne&s;s. My confu&s;ion was inex|pre&s;&s;ible: I was at a lo&s;s how to di&s;po&s;e of my looks; the prince was ob&s;erving me, and that in|crea&s;ed my di&s;order.</P>
<P>The chace began at la&s;t, and the duke contrived means to get near me. When he came up, I ex|pre&s;&s;ed &s;o much unea&s;ine&s;s at his &s;ight, that he with|drew very re&s;pectfully, &s;aying, I hope, then, ma|dam, you will take for done, all the &s;ervices I do not render you.</P>
<P>When the &s;port was over, the company repaired to a country &s;eat, which was finely illuminated; and, as &s;oon as they arrived, the ladies withdrew to the apartments prepared for them, in order to re|fre&s;h them&s;elves, and &s;hift their dre&s;&s;es. Here, pulling out my handkerchief, I found a letter in my pocket, without being able to know how it came there; and, ju&s;t as I was reading it, the prince &s;tepped into my chamber. I hid it in a great hur|ry, but he perceived my confu&s;ion, and &s;aid to me, I find, madam, I am trouble&s;ome, and &s;hall there|fore withdraw. The time was now come for my evil de&s;tiny to prevail over my life.</P>
<P>When I had changed cloaths, I was obliged to go down to the company. How difficult a matter it is to put on a plea&s;ant air with a bleeding heart!
<PB N="37" REF="047094_0038_1022AA7A19AAD8B8">
In the cour&s;e of the conver&s;ation I told the prince&s;s I was going down into the country. She a&s;ked me upon what account; I replied, my father was wil|ling to &s;pend a few weeks of the &s;pring at his &s;eat, and a&s;&s;ured her I &s;hould carry with me the mo&s;t grateful &s;en&s;e of the obligations I lay under to her goodne&s;s. She inquired likewi&s;e how far the hou&s;e might be; and upon my telling her that it was but two or three leagues off, &s;he had the complai|&s;ance to promi&s;e to come down and &s;ee me. I re|ceived all the&s;e marks of di&s;tinction as I ought.&mdash;The duke was pre&s;ent when I mentioned my jour|ney, and &s;eemed to expre&s;s a concern. But as for the prince, he did not appear the whole evening, which gave me much unea&s;ine&s;s. The company went to cards; there was al&s;o a concert in the drawing-room, whither I followed the prince&s;s, be|cau&s;e I found my account better with the mu&s;ic: for there I had nothing to do but feel and be &s;ilent. Supper was &s;erved up; every thing was in the mo&s;t magnificent ta&s;te; and there was a grand ball after.</P>
<P>The duke made the mo&s;t brilliant and graceful appearance in the world at this entertainment, and I own I found my&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with quite new &s;en|timents, which I perceived very well were tho&s;e the prince had been &s;o long requiring of me in his be|half, but which till then I had been utterly unac|quainted with. Though I was very &s;orry not to &s;ee him, becau&s;e his ab&s;ence was a &s;ure &s;ign of his di&s;content. Yet I could not help finding my&s;elf more at ca&s;e for a moment: my looks and &s;enti|ments had a greater liberty of action, and I &s;aw with &s;orrow, though not without a mixture of joy, the mo&s;t violent pa&s;&s;ion written in the duke's eyes. Whenever I happened to be his partner, he was thought to dance better than u&s;ual, and the prin|ce&s;s
<PB N="38" REF="047094_0039_1022AA7EC8078EA8">
made us repeat together &s;everal dances, which &s;he fancied we performed better than the re&s;t.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, he was endeavouring to plea&s;e, and was, perhaps, very &s;en&s;ible that he did &s;o.</P>
<P>After the ball was over, I hurried home to my apartment, whither Leonora, who had been &s;o kind as to keep always with me, al&s;o followed. As &s;oon as I &s;aw her, I ordered my maids to retire, and then &s;he began to tell me, how dearly I was like to pay for the moment's plea&s;ure I had had. I gave her an account of all that had pa&s;&s;ed, but &s;he knew it better than my&s;elf, having ob&s;erved me all the time. I &s;howed her the letter I had received, and told her how the prince had &s;urprized me reading it, and that no doubt he &s;u&s;pected it came from the duke of Praxede. Indeed, an&s;wered &s;he, you are to be pitied, madam; but what can be done for you? We &s;pent part of the night in con&s;ulting upon the different methods I could take, but day|light appearing before we could fix on any, we went to our beds unre&s;olved.</P>
<P>The prince called upon Leonora betimes in the morning: It is perhaps ill-mannerly, madam, &s;aid he, to come &s;o early to di&s;turb people that go to bed by day-light. He had, it &s;eems, pa&s;&s;ed the night on a terrace that lay under my window, and had &s;een how late we had &s;at up together; he knew al&s;o all that had happened at the ball, having been pre&s;ent in di&s;gui&s;e. He expre&s;&s;ed a lively and deep concern to Leonora, telling her how he had caught me reading a letter, which upon &s;ight of him, I had put up with a di&s;order that had be|trayed me, and, upon my friend's endeavouring to di&s;&s;uade him from the notions he had formed of that letter, he an&s;wered, I do not &s;eek to accu&s;e her, and &s;hould be very &s;orry to have any cau&s;e to do it. Alas! far from it: &s;o great was my good
<PB N="39" REF="047094_0039_1022AA7EC8078EA8">
opinion of her &s;incerity, that &s;he might have at|tempted any thing upon the &s;trength of my con|fidence.&mdash;What then is it you complain of, replied Leonora, what hath &s;he done more than common civility required? (for, as to the letter affair, &s;he made him believe he was mi&s;taken, and folks in love are ea&s;ily deceived). I cannot, an&s;wered he, ground either my &s;u&s;picions, or even my di&s;content, on any thing certain; but a &s;ecret foreboding di&s;|turbs my heart: my fears are not quieted by her love, and, when &s;he is with the duke, methinks I &s;ee in her eyes a &s;omething &s;he never hath with me. Leonora was not wanting in her endeavours to calm tho&s;e apprehen&s;ions. He begged her to ob|tain leave of my father to vi&s;it me in the country, and a&s;&s;ured her at parting, that his &s;u&s;picions and unea&s;ine&s;&s;es on my account &s;hould never reach him, and that he would owe nothing to paternal author|ity, nor accept of my hand if my heart did not tender it.</P>
<P>The prince having obtained the liberty he de&s;ired, I &s;at out without daring to take leave of my father, and under his di&s;plea&s;ure I found my&s;elf more ea&s;y in the country. Our &s;eat was a noble building, though not in the modern ta&s;te: there was a large park, fine woods, and plea&s;ant water. Nature &s;eem|ed every where at liberty, without being forced by art. I was in hopes that the calm tranquillity that reigned in this place might diffu&s;e it&s;elf into my &s;oul: but, alas! the pa&s;&s;ions delight in &s;ilence, they increa&s;e and &s;trengthen by &s;olitude. I found my&s;elf with di&s;po&s;itions till then unknown, and in a di&s;order and agitation, which neverthele&s;s had a &s;ecret charm.</P>
<P>Leonora often intruded upon my &s;olitary mo|ments to rouze me out of my reveries, and oblig|ingly reproach me with &s;hunning her. Then, &s;aid I,
<PB N="40" REF="047094_0041_1022AA82DD4001B0">
I mu&s;t al&s;o &s;hun my&s;elf, for you are my &s;ole com|fort. But the truth is, that all my time is not &s;uf|ficient to be&s;tow on what I feel of late.&mdash;Your re|flections, an&s;wered &s;he, might be better employed on the misfortunes love has in &s;tore for you. I know my advices will be in vain again&s;t a growing pa&s;&s;ion, but, though u&s;ele&s;s, I &s;till owe them to you: con&s;ider, madam, continued &s;he, that you are wanting to every thing that is mo&s;t &s;acred, to your|&s;elf, to your father, and what is &s;till more, to the mo&s;t lovely prince in the world, and to the true&s;t and be&s;t proved pa&s;&s;ion that ever was; and for whom? For one you do not know, and who will mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly render your life mi&s;erable. You mu&s;t not fancy, that all pa&s;&s;ions carry their excu&s;es with them.&mdash;Here we were interrupted and part|ed. I was very &s;en&s;ible &s;he was in the right, but her rea&s;on and mine were both too weak to help me. She was threatening me with misfortunes, and troubling my life, without effectually arming me again&s;t my evil de&s;tiny.</P>
<P>I do not know by what enchantment every thing about me &s;erved the duke. I cannot tell whether he had bribed any of my people, but I met with marks of his pa&s;&s;ion in every place. Once I found a letter on my toilet; at other times ver&s;es would be offered to my view in the woods and mo&s;t bye places, whither I liked to retire. Here is the let|ter I have &s;poken of. At fir&s;t I made a &s;cruple of unfolding it; and, had it been po&s;&s;ible, would have &s;ent it back whence it came, unopened: but we can hardly deny our&s;elves a plea&s;ure that pre&s;ents it&s;elf, and the receiving of which is to be unknown. I therefore opened it, and read the&s;e words:</P>
<P>"I tremble, Mademoi&s;elle, to appear before you, and am under a dread of your di&s;plea&s;ure; yet what makes my crime, ought to be my excu&s;e&mdash;I can|not
<PB N="41" REF="047094_0042_1022AA8468217000">
forbear telling you that you have taught me to love, without knowing your&s;elf tho&s;e tender &s;enti|ments you have taught me. Though, were you to judge of your&s;elf only by the pa&s;&s;ion you have in|&s;pired in me, you could not be ignorant that you are the mo&s;t adorable creature in the world. But by the infinite &s;en&s;e I have of your worth, methinks I am &s;till placing you at a greater di&s;tance from me. I have a love and re&s;pect which you only can in&s;pire, and which no one but my&s;elf is capable of feeling."</P>
<P>The next day as I was going to &s;it down by a large canal in a grove, I found this other letter on a &s;eat of green turf, on which I u&s;ed to re&s;t my&s;elf.</P>
<P>"You need not be under any fear on my account, Mademoi&s;elle. The &s;entiments you have rai&s;ed in me have all the warmth of pa&s;&s;ion, with the inno|cence of virtue. I dare glory in the avowing them, and will believe I have no other merit but what is derived from them. Let the di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of my affection plead in its behalf; &s;ince there can be no greater proof of love, than to be more eager to love than to be loved again. For my part, I am rewarded for my pa&s;&s;ion by what I feel, and am plea&s;ed with the expectation of happier days:&mdash;Judge, then, madam, if I can ever fail of honour|ing and re&s;pecting you."</P>
<P>Another day this third billet was offered to my view in a clo&s;et, whither I u&s;ed to retire.</P>
<P>"I pa&s;s the days and nights under your walls, and, though I cannot live from the place that holds my bli&s;s, I know not how to approach; all the ways that lead to my charmer appear full of diffi|culties. But even this becomes an advantage, &s;ince finding you at la&s;t, mu&s;t claim &s;ome merit.&mdash;I can|not return to court; I have not power to di&s;charge my duty there:&mdash;and think, wherever you are not,
<PB N="42" REF="047094_0043_1022AA8901662F50">
I am obliged to no duty but that of regretting your ab&s;ence. Much le&s;s can I &s;eek for plea&s;ure. Can any be found without you? I find at lea&s;t there is none for me in the world but where you are. In you alone, love has centered all my hopes, my wi&s;hes, and my plea&s;ures.&mdash;Will you not then, through pity, relieve what I &s;uffer through love?"</P>
<P>Thus every thing &s;poke in his behalf, and was ever reminding me of what I could not forget. I believed ea&s;ily the agreeable truths that clo&s;ed with my de&s;ires. He was by degrees u&s;ing me to hear him talk of his pa&s;&s;ion, and in&s;en&s;ibly gaining upon my delicacy and ba&s;hfulne&s;s, whil&s;t I allowed and forgave my loving him.</P>
<P>A few days after my arrival in the country, the counte&s;s Emilia came to &s;ee me. She was a friend of the family's, and had always expre&s;&s;ed a high friend&s;hip for me. She brought with her a very amiable daughter, who, after the fir&s;t acquaintance, ob&s;erving that I was alone, and might be glad of company, offered very kindly to &s;tay behind with me, if I would but a&s;k her mamma leave. At any other time I &s;hould have been very glad of &s;uch an offer, but I was now &s;o melancholy, and &s;o much taken up with my pa&s;&s;ion, that, though &s;ometimes I endeavoured to divert my thoughts, I &s;till fell into my old way, and my tenderne&s;s made me believe that I owed my&s;elf wholly and entirely to my &s;en|&s;ations of love, and that to deviate from them was no better than an infidelity. However, I could not well decline a&s;king her of her mother, and there|fore made the propo&s;al, which &s;he readily came into.</P>
<P>I diverted my new companion as well as I could. We &s;oon contracted a familiarity with one another, and yet &s;he was not open with me, but &s;eemed rath|er pen&s;ive and taken up with &s;omething at heart.
<PB N="43" REF="047094_0044_1022AA8B929EC4F8">
I did not choo&s;e to let her know I perceived it, for fear of giving her unea&s;ine&s;s, nor pre&s;s to be let in|to her &s;ecrets, becau&s;e I was glad her re&s;ervedne&s;s towards, gave me a right of behaving in the &s;ame manner to her. She would often be alone, which plea&s;ed me much, as I had thereby the liberty and opportunity of being &s;o too.</P>
<P>Going one day into her apartments, I was great|ly &s;urprized to find the duke with her, and I be|lieve they both perceived the di&s;order his pre&s;ence threw me into. At fir&s;t I had a great mind to re|&s;ent it, but contained my&s;elf upon reflection, that, not being acquainted with the &s;ecret of my heart, &s;he could mean no harm in introducing the duke. I could not hinder her from &s;eeing her friends at my hou&s;e, and the duke, knowing nothing of what I had &s;uffered upon his account, could have no no|tion of di&s;obliging me by a vi&s;it to a lady of his acquaintance. The&s;e rea&s;ons calmed my re&s;ent|ment.&mdash;I made but a &s;hort &s;tay with them, and ran immediately after to Leonora. I told her I had ju&s;t &s;een the duke in my friend's apartment, and what concern it gave me, le&s;t my father and the prince &s;hould think I had an hand in it, begging her to tell me what I had be&s;t do. She knew me too well to &s;u&s;pect any artifice in my conduct. My fears an&s;wered for me; and &s;he knew I could feel, but that was all. She therefore told me &s;he would wait on my father with an account of the whole of the matter, and would take his orders how to act, but that &s;he was pretty &s;ure he would &s;u&s;pect no|thing further.</P>
<P>It fell out accordingly. He was per&s;uaded that it was a mere chance accident, and, that as it was not po&s;&s;ible to turn out of doors a young lady of my friend's quality, &s;o was it likewi&s;e impo&s;&s;ible to prevent her receiving what vi&s;its &s;he plea&s;ed in her
<PB N="44" REF="047094_0045_1022AA8D1B311328">
apartment; but he de&s;ired her never to be one mo|ment from me. They agreed al&s;o that he &s;hould now and then take a trip down to us, to conceal from the world the knowledge of my di&s;grace with him, and prevent people's talk about it to my di&s;|advantage.</P>
<P>Leonora's return made me ea&s;y as to my father, but I was certain all our precautions would avail nothing with the prince, and that he wou'd not hearken to rea&s;on like the old gentleman. Going into my room, I found a letter laid upon a couch, and indeed few days pa&s;&s;ed without my receiving &s;ome, one way or another. I opened it, and read the&s;e words:</P>
<P>"I appear no more at court, Mademoi&s;elle, out of regard for my love. I cannot help thinking my pa&s;&s;ion is legible in my eyes, and by looking at me I fancy every body can di&s;cover that you are the per&s;on I adore.&mdash;What! mu&s;t I make a &s;ecret of loving you? The only merit I would boa&s;t of is a high &s;en&s;e of your value, and a re&s;pect equal to your worth.&mdash;My &s;entiments, madam, want only to be felt, and I words to expre&s;s them."</P>
<P>Ever after I avoided going into my friend's apartment, but &s;he was fonder of my company than ever. You &s;hun me, &s;aid &s;he, one day, you have found out the duke's inclination to you, and fancy me deep in &s;ome plot again&s;t you; but do me the ju&s;tice to believe, that though he is very much my friend, I am incapable of acting any part unworthy of you, or my&s;elf.&mdash;But, &s;aid I, where did you get acquainted with this man, for I am &s;ure I have ne|ver &s;een him at your hou&s;e!&mdash;I have known him a long while, replied &s;he, and the rea&s;on of your not &s;eeing him was, becau&s;e he was at the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> at the time you <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> us. I became acquainted with him at the marchione&s;s * * *, and &s;hall one day or an|other
<PB N="45" REF="047094_0046_1022AA8EA5B9FD50">
tell you the hi&s;tory of our friend&s;hip; but at pre&s;ent give me leave to inform you, that he feels the &s;tronge&s;t pa&s;&s;ion for you. What part therefore will you have me act? Will you not take it ami&s;s if I receive his profe&s;&s;ions to deliver them to you? Tell me how I can &s;erve you. If this doth not plea&s;e you, and his love is offen&s;ive, I will have no|thing more to &s;ay to him. My friend was much too hard for me. She wanted to know the di&s;po&s;i|tions of my &s;oul, and people in love are apt to be communicative, for the&s;e two &s;entiments always go hand in hand. Be&s;ides, &s;he was a &s;i&s;ter per&s;on to make a confidante of, than Leonora, our ages agreeing better with one another. I therefore un|bo&s;omed my &s;oul, and told her my &s;ecret upon honour not to mention a word of it to the duke, which &s;he promi&s;ed, and I am willing to believe &s;he has kept her word with me. I informed her without re&s;erve of all I have related to you: my &s;tory &s;urprized and affected her much, and &s;he gave me new a&s;&s;urances of doing nothing but what I &s;hould think &s;it.</P>
<P>The next day we took a walk at a &s;mall di&s;tance from our &s;eat. It was a very fine place. Whil&s;t we were abroad, prince Camillus came to pay us a vi&s;it, but was told I was gone out. He thought, I &s;uppo&s;e, that in the country one was always to be met with at home, and could not conceive, that having &s;o large and fine a park, we &s;hould go to &s;eek a walk abroad. Yet, had he thought proper, he might have been &s;atisfied of the truth. If he had but a&s;ked the &s;ervants, they could have told him, where I was. But, without making the lea&s;t inquiry he went away in a pa&s;&s;ion, and the next day &s;ent me the following letter.</P>
<P>"Love led me ye&s;terday to your &s;olitude. Ma|demoi&s;elle, but even Capid <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> met with a di&s;|appointment.
<PB N="46" REF="047094_0047_1022AA938118CAD0">
I found nothing but a melancholy &s;olitude, every thing that could plea&s;e was fled with you. However, do not fear that my complaints &s;hall ever more come to di&s;turb your plea&s;ures. No; I value them as your's: though I cannot ta&s;te any, where you are ab&s;ent, may you &s;till partake of a great deal where I am far off; proofs of love be|come offen&s;ive when we are not in a di&s;po&s;ition to make them a return."</P>
<P>That very evening we took a walk by our&s;elves; my friend made me va&s;t prote&s;tations of friend&s;hip, and &s;poke with great &s;en&s;ibility of all I had men|tioned to her. Our conver&s;ation was long and ten|der, but at la&s;t it grew late, and we were obliged to return homewards.</P>
<P>As we were walking back to the ca&s;tle, I heard a noi&s;e near me, and was mightily &s;urprized to find my&s;elf &s;topped by &s;omebody that lay at my feet.&mdash;I gave a &s;hriek, upon which a voice, which I &s;oon knew for the duke's, &s;aid&mdash;Do not be frightened, madam, I am no enemy.&mdash;Yes, &s;ir, an&s;wered I, you mu&s;t be one, cruelly thus to expo&s;e me.&mdash;You will not be expo&s;ed, replied he; nobody can know I am here, and your reputation is dearer to me than my pa&s;&s;ion: but what can I do with the mighty &s;tore of love you have in&s;pired me with?&mdash;I now turned to my friend, and a&s;ked whether &s;he had a hand in this piece of treachery?&mdash;No, ma|dam, an&s;wered he for her, &s;he has no manner of &s;hare in what I do, and it is from the innocence and purity of my &s;entiments alone I have borrowed this pre&s;umption. He then threw him&s;elf again at my feet, and &s;aid the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate things in the world. I would have got from him, and called my friend, but could not &s;tir, &s;omething invi&s;ible, un|known, too prevailing, &s;eized my &s;oul, and my legs refu&s;ed to perform their office. Fortunately I had
<PB N="47" REF="047094_0048_1022AA950CEEC2B0">
not power to &s;peak, and therefore only an&s;wered him with my heart, but my eyes would ea&s;ily have betrayed their meaning, could he have &s;een them. In &s;hort, he per&s;uaded me of his pa&s;&s;ion. Heavens! what did he not &s;ay, and how did it not affect me? But, at la&s;t, my friend informing us that day-light was approaching, and that we mu&s;t part, he a&s;ked leave to return again the next day. I had not power to deny him, and withdrew in a di&s;order and agitation that cannot be expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>I pa&s;&s;ed the remainder of the night awake, and was never taken up with &s;uch a variety of &s;enti|ments: for joy, grief, hopes, fear, and remor&s;e, took their turns, and rai&s;ed &s;uch a &s;torm in my brea&s;t, that day appeared before &s;leep could approach my eyelids.</P>
<P>I went very early to my friend's apartment, and finding her pen&s;ive and &s;orrowful, enquired into the rea&s;on. I &s;hall be loth to tell it you, an&s;wered &s;he, but yet I cannot betray the confidence you repo&s;e in me, and &s;hould think my&s;elf wanting in my obli|gations to you, if I did not acquaint you with the duke's engagements. What! cried I, has he then placed his affections el&s;ewhere? Perhaps that is all over, replied &s;he&punc; you are capable of effacing the deepe&s;t impre&s;&s;ions; but, however, hear me out if you can: I am going to reveal to you his &s;ecret and my own.&mdash;Sure, &s;aid I, it is not you that he is in love with?&mdash;No, madam, replied &s;he ha&s;tily, compo&s;e your&s;elf and hear me; for you mu&s;t know the bottom, in order to take the cour&s;e that can &s;it you be&s;t.</P>
<P>I have known the duke &s;ome time. He was &s;omewhat forward in courting an acquaintance with me, and got one of my relations to introduce him. I was a&s;toni&s;hed that a man of his youth, and &s;o taken up with gay plea&s;ures, &s;hould come to &s;eek a
<PB N="48" REF="047094_0049_1022AA9797D132D0">
per&s;on much retired, and who thought more of leading a rational life, than one diver&s;ified with mirth and gaiety. I enquired therefore into his views, and &s;elf-love made me believe, that, not being a bad match as to fortune, they might relate to me. But I was not long in that error. You know there's a friend&s;hip between madam L* * * and me. She is very amiable. I &s;u&s;pected his a&s;&s;iduity at our hou&s;e might be meant for her, and accordingly, by often talking to him about her, and telling him all the hand&s;ome things I could think of her, I was &s;oon convinced that his fondne&s;s was all intended for that friend. The di&s;covery nettled me a little; I avoided &s;ome time enquiring why, and my heart would fain have &s;pared me an in&s;ight into my weakne&s;s; but, as I feared its &s;urprizes, I was not deceived, and thought I mu&s;t apply the nece&s;&s;ary remedies.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t I made a re&s;olution never to &s;ee him more. Alas! it would have proved more for my &s;atisfac|tion, had I followed this, than the conduct I after|wards impo&s;ed upon my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Indeed, fancying I could do &s;till better, I &s;et about wre&s;ting his &s;ecret from him, and was even at the advance of the whole expen&s;e of the confi|dence, by telling him the misfortune I had had to lo&s;e the Marquis * * *, with whom my family had entered into &s;ome engagements relating to a match between us; how &s;en&s;ibly I had been affected with the breaking off of the intended alliance; with what regret I forbid him my doors, when decency and the commands of my relations would no lon|ger allow of his vi&s;its; how much this conduct in|crea&s;ed my pa&s;&s;ion; and how I found by experi|ence, that &s;everity &s;erves love, and &s;trengthens the impre&s;&s;ion. I made him this confidence, with a view of placing an eternal ob&s;tacle between him and
<PB N="49" REF="047094_0050_1022AA9923CCF678">
my own heart. I likewi&s;e gave by this a pretence and excu&s;e to my &s;orrow, and a&s;cribed to another, the effects of my pa&s;&s;ion for him.</P>
<P>This confidence di&s;plea&s;ed him; whether it was contrary to his de&s;igns, or that his vanity had been flattered with the belief that my heart inclined to him; but yet I thought I perceived he had &s;ome &s;ecret views, and would have it in his power to at|tempt me when he &s;hould think fit.&mdash;It is pretty much the way of the men to have &s;ome object in re&s;erve, after letting their imaginations rove, and lo&s;ing their ta&s;te for their pre&s;ent plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>My confidence had quite a contrary effect to what I imagined, for he became eager and fond.&mdash;He was incon&s;olable, as he &s;aid, at my having &s;uch &s;entiments for another; and when I told him, that it took nothing from him, he thought me guilty of want of delicacy in not under&s;tanding there were pa&s;&s;ions of e&s;teem infinitely above tho&s;e of the &s;en&s;es. The truth was, I wanted no other from him, but the difficulty lay in convincing me that his was of that kind. Whatever he could &s;ay, I did not believe him the more for it, and there were even &s;ome moments when I e&s;teemed him the le&s;s on that account. He continued always in the &s;ame &s;train, and, had I been willing to flatter my &s;elf-love, I might have believed that I had in&s;pired him with a very &s;ublime pa&s;&s;ion. But this did not &s;atisfy me; I wanted to come to &s;ome conclu&s;ion, and fix my &s;ituation by his.</P>
<P>Many ways offered to that end. I was mi&s;tre&s;s of his &s;ecret. He had intru&s;ted me with his repo&s;e, had de&s;ired me to direct him; and I could without treachery, act a part con&s;i&s;tent with my intere&s;t, by refu&s;ing to &s;erve him in his amour. Another would have taken the opportunity to be revenged of the
<PB N="50" REF="047094_0051_1022AA9B0C3054B0">
preference given to a rival, and nothing was ea&s;ier than this, for my friend was timorous; &s;he was afraid of the world and her family; &s;he feared the duke him&s;elf, and I had nothing to do but to in|dulge her in her own way.</P>
<P>A more worthy conduct, however, pre&s;ented it&s;elf at the &s;ame time. I kept off all the low re&s;ent|ments we women are &s;u&s;ceptible of. I examined his ca&s;e and my own, and did not find him guilty in feeling for another, what I could have wi&s;hed he had felt for me. I thought it was my bu&s;ine&s;s to puni&s;h my&s;elf for a mi&s;placed affection, by turning it to his advantage, and that my affection ought to be pure and powerful enough to be a&s;&s;i&s;ting in mak|ing him more happy in another. I laid a&s;ide all my tenderne&s;s, and forgot my own intere&s;t, in or|der to impo&s;e upon my&s;elf the mo&s;t difficult conduct in the world, which, however, I have hitherto been able to keep up to. I fancied, that if he could be touched by an honourable behaviour, I &s;hould thereby make a worthy friend of him; and that, however, if it was all lo&s;t upon him, it would not be &s;o for me. In &s;hort, my deluded imagination has &s;erved him &s;o well, that it has been able to per|&s;uade me, that nothing would be more worthy of me than to conquer my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I therefore &s;et about advancing his intere&s;t with my friend, as if on their happine&s;s the whole of mine had depended. I &s;poke to lady L * * * of the great pa&s;&s;ion he had for her. I painted it in the &s;tronge&s;t colours, and drew a picture, &s;ketched by truth, but ornamented by love. My friend was &s;omewhat prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed again&s;t him, but I found means to combat her prejudices. I calmed her fears; I an&s;wered for him; I took all upon my&s;elf; I touched her heart; I moved her inclination to tenderne&s;s, and relieved her mode&s;ty. In &s;hort,
<PB N="51" REF="047094_0052_1022AAA1DA8AFF88">
when he came to &s;ee her, he had nothing to do, but to fini&s;h what I had &s;o well begun. He found the impre&s;&s;ion ready made to his hands.</P>
<P>There were, indeed, &s;ome moments when I could not help thinking the part I had acted very much out of character. "I am wanting to every thing, &s;aid I; I act again&s;t my own principles; I forget the regard I owe to my&s;elf, and know no other duty, but that of expre&s;&s;ing my attachment to him. What a &s;cene is this for indifferent people to &s;ee?"&mdash;Yet, when I con&s;ulted my heart and affections, I thought there could be nothing greater than to give him up to another. I judged of the merit of my conduct by what it co&s;t me. Thus, without regard to my&s;elf, without the lea&s;t tender concern for my own &s;ituation, I have admitted no thought, but that of effecting his happine&s;s.</P>
<P>There was a time when I hoped to enjoy the &s;ad comfort of &s;eeing him no more: he &s;eemed to have taken &s;ome di&s;gu&s;t, and I advi&s;ed him to break off with my friend and me. That was le&s;s cruel, in my opinion, than the laborious ta&s;k I had taken upon me. Indeed I &s;u&s;pected he was at this time in love with madam C * * * *, but he would not own it.</P>
<P>In the mean while I was attentive to every thing that happened. I watched all his &s;teps and mo|tions, and was ready to magnify every fault he committed, through the de&s;ire I had of finding him guilty; and indeed I was not in humour to invent excu&s;es for him.</P>
<P>But, at la&s;t, after an eclairci&s;&s;ement, he was re|conciled, and became fonder than ever of my friend. I now found how cutting it was to know the object of our affections attached to &s;omething perfect; yet, far from allowing my intere&s;t to encroach on the ju&s;tice I owed my friend, my delicacy, and fear
<PB N="52" REF="047094_0053_10224BFD9D43F950">
of being wanting to her, increa&s;ed her merit with me. Ever &s;ince they admitted me into their con|fidence, I cannot reproach my&s;elf with having once thought of what would have been for my own ad|vantage. All my advice has been &s;incere, and has &s;erved their intere&s;ts again&s;t my own heart; &s;o that the greate&s;t pa&s;&s;ion that ever was, has all along been &s;ub&s;ervient to friend&s;hip. I have thought on|ly of conquering my inclinations, and puni&s;hing my|&s;elf for a pa&s;&s;ion, which it was not in my power to &s;uppre&s;s, &s;ince the heart involuntarily yields to im|pre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>On a time, the duke would fain have per&s;uaded me he had changed his mind, and was always tell|ing me things very much to my friend's di&s;advan|tage. This lo&s;t him my e&s;teem. He redoubled his complai&s;ance to me: when &s;he was pre&s;ent, he would &s;eem fonder of me, than of her: he offered me a preference which might have flattered my vanity. He followed me in all places; he grew jealous of every thing that came near me, and his jealou&s;y was real, for he would have been very un|willing to lo&s;e me. But he conducted a pa&s;&s;ion and a de&s;ign alike; a per&s;on le&s;s upon her guard might have mi&s;taken the one for the other, but my mind could &s;ee all his faults, though my heart was not yet &s;en&s;ible of them.&mdash;</P>
<P>If I had not &s;poke, during this long narrative, it was becau&s;e I really had not power to do it; and my friend, quite intent upon her &s;tory, had not taken notice of the condition I was in all the while. But now, unable to bear any longer, I gave a &s;hrick, and cried out&mdash;It is enough. Oh! tell me no more;&mdash;and with that, the violent con&s;traint I had put upon my&s;elf, having quite exhau&s;ted my &s;pirits, I &s;unk down in a &s;woon, and was a long while in the arms of my women without recovering from
<PB N="53" REF="047094_0054_1022AAA506C4AE68">
my fit; but, to my misfortune, they recalled me at la&s;t to life.</P>
<P>Scarce had I opened my eyes, and began to re|cover my &s;pirits, but a great noi&s;e and bu&s;tle was heard about the hou&s;e, and &s;ome of my maids left me to run and &s;ee what it might be. But as they did not return, and the loud cries continued, I leaned upon the arm of one of them, and &s;taggered towards the place from whence they proceeded.&mdash;Ju&s;t as I got to the hall, I &s;aw four men bringing in another bathed in his blood, whom, as he turned his head towards me, I knew to be the prince.&mdash;This &s;ight almo&s;t rivetted me to the ground; but, making an effort, I moved forwards to follow the mournful &s;pectacle. They laid him on a couch in the parlour, and I made &s;igns to the &s;ervants to run for help, for I could &s;carce &s;peak. The prince &s;eeing me, turned his expiring eyes towards me, and &s;aid&mdash;I have not been able to touch your heart, madam, nor convince you of my love: I &s;hall, however, die contented, if in my la&s;t moments I can per&s;uade you that no one ever loved you &s;o truly as I have, though a more happy man puts me in the condition I am now in.&mdash;At this in&s;tant the eyes of all pre&s;ent, who were not a few, fla&s;hed up|on me with indignation, but I was yet more hate|ful to my&s;elf than to them; and Leonora, who came running at the noi&s;e, &s;eeing my condition, dragged me away from this di&s;mal &s;ight.</P>
<P>I was led up to my chamber. I begged of her, however, to go and take care of the prince, and to &s;end away with all expedition for the able&s;t &s;ur|geons that could be got. They had already taken care of that, and as we were not at a great di&s;tance from town, they were not long in coming. They examined his wounds, and found them mortal.&mdash;I
<PB N="54" REF="047094_0055_1022AAA69C9D93A8">
&s;ent every moment to know his condition, but could &s;ee very well by the looks of my women that there was no hopes of him.</P>
<P>My friend came at la&s;t, and, by the grief &s;he ex|pre&s;&s;ed, I gue&s;&s;ed the prince's condition.&mdash;It is the duke, &s;aid &s;he to me, that has fought him.&mdash;Can you, an&s;wered I, be the bearer of &s;uch cruel news!&mdash;Why, replied &s;he, you mu&s;t be informed of what is become a public talk, that you may be able to regulate your&s;elf accordingly.&mdash;Though &s;he was in the right, I could not help thinking her cruel to talk &s;o; but grief is often unju&s;t. I begged her to return to the prince's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and not to leave him.</P>
<P>I then withdrew to my clo&s;et, with one of my women, in whom I confided mo&s;t, and, throwing my&s;elf on a couch, &s;aid, "I have nothing more to do in this world, and yet am not allowed to bring death to my relief! What a cruelty to be obliged to &s;upport life under &s;uch circum&s;tances!&mdash;But, come; I have always depended upon your attach|ment to me; follow me. I can no longer endure the &s;ight of human kind.&mdash;Whither, madam, mu&s;t we go? replied &s;he.&mdash;No matter where, an&s;wered I, provided I avoid the eyes of all my acquaintance." The girl endeavoured to oppo&s;e my de&s;ign, but to no purpo&s;e. I opened a door on the back &s;tairs that led to the garden, and was going out, when &s;he &s;topped me, by telling me how improper it would be to go away with the cloaths I had on, and all my jewels about me, de&s;iring me to &s;tay at lea&s;t till &s;he had dre&s;&s;ed me in one of her plaine&s;t &s;uite. I was per&s;uaded, and bid her make ha&s;te, not being able to tarry a moment longer in this fatal hou&s;e. "But, will you not wait the utmo&s;t of the prince's fate, re&s;umed &s;he again, and mu&s;t not that, madam, regulate your de&s;tiny'"&mdash;Alas,
<PB N="55" REF="047094_0056_1022AAA9833D8F30">
an&s;wered I, do&s;t thou not hear the di&s;mal &s;hricks of the whole family, too expre&s;&s;ive of his not having one moment longer to live.</P>
<P>Saying the&s;e words, I flew down &s;tairs. We pa&s;&s;ed the garden without meeting any body, and got out by a back door that opened into a large wood. The day was beginning to clo&s;e: I walked &s;ome time without uttering a word: &s;hame and fear &s;unk all my &s;pirits. At la&s;t, quite &s;pent and over|come, I fell to the ground, and leaned my head on the lap of the woman that attended me. The poor creature was incon&s;olable to &s;ee me in that condi|tion. She &s;poke, but I neither an&s;wered nor hearkened to her. The night grew dark and di&s;|mal. Overpowered by grief and wearine&s;s, I fell a&s;leep as I lay, for nature will take care of her&s;elf, and will lo&s;e nothing of her dues.</P>
<P>I opened my eyes ju&s;t as the day began to break, and my misfortunes glaring afre&s;h with the light, I was filled with horror when I &s;aw them di&s;tinctly. I recalled them all to my mind. I lo&s;e an accom|pli&s;hed prince, &s;aid I; I have not loved him, when his pa&s;&s;ion, meeting with a return of mine, might have made us happy, and I adore him now I am on the point of lo&s;ing him! Mercile&s;s love means to revenge him, and make me the object of its mo&s;t cruel per&s;ecutions.&mdash;And by what hand do I lo&s;e him? By the hand of a perfidious man, who perhaps, has never loved me. I have been the vic|tim of his vanity. My life, my reputation, all is to be enveloped in the odium of guilt. I &s;hall be confounded with tho&s;e of my &s;ex, who have for&s;ak|en glory and forfeited their honour. What a heart|breaking &s;tory for a father, who&s;e delight and darling I once was! But in what condition mu&s;t the prince's mother be, &s;he who lived but for him? Mu&s;t it be my fate to involve &s;o many people in
<PB N="56" REF="047094_0057_1022AAAC1B3E9C00">
my misfortunes? Why do I fly? It would be too happy for me to be &s;acrificed to their ju&s;t re|&s;entment.&mdash;And, indeed, in &s;ome moments, I was for going back to offer my&s;elf to their fury, but then again, &s;hame getting the better of my de&s;pe|rate re&s;olution, I could think of nothing but hid|ing my&s;elf from their eyes, and &s;eeking &s;ome for|lorn cave, where I might &s;pend the remainder of my days.&mdash;"But after all, &s;aid I again to my&s;elf, what is my crime, good God! thou knowe&s;t the bottom of all hearts. An involuntary pa&s;&s;ion hath entered my &s;oul. I have rejected and oppo&s;ed its gratifications. I never have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed my duty nor mode&s;ty. What then am I puni&s;hed for?"</P>
<P>The young woman that bore me company, was all this while melting into tears. "Alas, madam, &s;aid &s;he, what re&s;olution are you taking? So fair and &s;o young, what are you not going to expo&s;e your&s;elf to?&mdash;Perhaps, replied I, I &s;hall meet with, &s;ome friendly villain who will deprive me of a life, which the Deity orders me to retain as a puni&s;h|ment. No, an&s;wered &s;he, you can find no enemies among&s;t men; but if you will be ruled by me, I have a &s;i&s;ter &s;ettled in a &s;mall town not far off; I will conduct you to her; you will not be known, and will be le&s;s di&s;agreeable there, than thus wander|ing about from place to place."</P>
<P>I took her advice; we &s;et out, and in a little time arrived at the place, whither &s;he de&s;igned to carry me. Her &s;i&s;ter received us very kindly;&mdash;I went for her friend, as it had been agreed between us; I found them bu&s;y in marrying one of their children. But, on the wedding-day, as I did not choo&s;e to be &s;een by the company, I went out ear|ly in the morning, with my companion, under pre|tence of taking an airing, and, walking by the edge of a little hill, I &s;aw a wood. I took a fancy <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">

go into it, and perceiving a hut, which my friend told me was an hermitage, I went up to it, and found it open. A &s;hepherd, that was attending his flock near the place, informed us, that the hermit, who u&s;ed to inhabit it, was thought to be lately dead in going his rounds about the country. Up|on this information, I &s;tepped in, and finding it convenient for my purpo&s;e, cried out immediately to my maid&mdash;"This is a dwelling kind fortune of|fers me; here I am determined to &s;pend the re|mainder of my &s;orrowful days." I have according|ly put my project in execution, and, to this day, ladies, no body but you have been here to interrupt my &s;olitude and grief.</P>
