<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>JOB xxx.23.</BIBL>
<P>FOR I KNOW THAT THOU WILT BRING ME TO DEATH, AND TO THE HOUSE APPOINTED FOR ALL LIVING.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WITH the time, or circum&s;tances of our removal from life, we are not acquainted; but of the ultimate certainty of the event, there is no ground to doubt.</P>
<P>PERSONS may conjecture that they &s;hall not out|live a particular &s;ea&s;on; or that they &s;hall die by a particular di&s;order, or calamity: and yet be &s;up|ported through that &s;ea&s;on, and &s;aved from the evil they apprehended.&mdash;On the other hand to pre&s;ume on a cour&s;e of years, imagining that we are exempt from di&s;ea&s;e, or ca&s;ualties, would not only be a &s;in, but might prove an experimental mi&s;take. By cau&s;es not fore&s;een, or which were not con&s;idered dangerous, we might be arou&s;ed from &s;ecurity, and brought to the grave.</P>
<P>THE hour of death, like the coming of the Son of man to judgment, is known to no one; but of the certainty of death there is the fulle&s;t evidence from the experience of man in all ages, and the general &s;tate of nature: from the indications of frailty in
<PB N="6" REF="038196_0004_101141BCCD6AC8B0">
our own con&s;titution, and the te&s;timony of the word of GOD.</P>
<P>THE grave is repre&s;ented as <HI>the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> appointed for</HI> ALL <HI>living.</HI> The characters and conditions of mankind are exceedingly diver&s;ified in a number of re&s;pects; but whatever di&s;tinctions may &s;ub&s;i&s;t between them, they are all alike in this, that they mu&s;t die, and make their bed in the du&s;t. Here <HI>the rich and poor meet together,</HI> and the <HI>servant is free from his master.</HI> In this place all di&s;tinctions are obliterated, all relations di&s;&s;olved, all acqui&s;i|tions relinqui&s;hed: <HI>Naked came</HI> we from the earth, <HI>and naked</HI> do we <HI>return thither,</HI> Job i.21. <HI>All go to one place: All are of the dust, and all return to dust again,</HI> Eccles. iii.20.</P>
<P>IT is &s;aid, "<HI>I know, that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house</HI> APPOINTED <HI>for all living;</HI> implying that it is the certain, unchanging purpo&s;e of GOD, that all &s;hall die. Death is not an occa|&s;ional event; but is pre-determined in the plan of divine providence, is the fixed ordination of Heaven. In conformity with this, no provi&s;ion is made in nature, by which any one can po&s;&s;ibly avoid the change. Frequently when a per&s;on lies in death, we behold an example of the inefficacy of all created expedients to pre&s;erve life. None of the productions of the fields could afford nouri&s;hment: and the powers of medicine, aided by the mo&s;t di&s;|cerning &s;kill, and &s;ympathetic kindne&s;s, could not relieve and heal; but the appointment of GOD was carried, without interruption, into full effect.</P>
<P>THIS pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture leads us to con&s;ider, not only the <HI>certainty</HI> and <HI>universality</HI> of death, but that
<PB N="7" REF="038196_0005_101141BFCF095D80">
it is a di&s;pen&s;ation of the divine hand, <HI>I know that</HI> THOU <HI>wilt bring me to death.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>GOD, though infinitely exalted and ble&s;&s;ed, re|gards the &s;tate of the children of men. He appoint|ed the general frailty of their nature, and determines the order, and manner in which it &s;hall be executed, exerci&s;ing over each one a providential care. <HI>It is not in man, who walketh, to direct his steps; but in the hand of</HI> GOD <HI>are all his ways,</HI> Jer. x, 22. He ob&s;erves our going out, and coming in: he is ac|quainted with our &s;tate in pro&s;perity and adver&s;ity; in &s;ickne&s;s and health: in the various relations we &s;u&s;tain&mdash;and it is not without a due con&s;ideration of all connected circum&s;tances, that any change is produced, and that death is experienced.</P>
<P>IF per&s;ons be brought to death, by the appoint|ment and will of GOD, there is infinite wi&s;dom in the di&s;pen&s;ation. To con&s;ider any event as under his government; and yet oppo&s;ed to infinite wi&s;dom, is incon&s;i&s;tent. Though death in it&s;elf is evil and afflictive, and a rever&s;ion of the original order of nature; yet that it is &s;ubordinated to wi&s;e and holy purpo&s;es, is evident from the infinite perfection of Deity, and from the declared and known rea&s;ons of the appointment.</P>
<P>THE entrance of &s;in into the world rendered the &s;entence of death ju&s;t.&mdash;Wi&s;ely to adapt the con|dition of mankind to a &s;ea&s;on of trial, finally to be terminated, it was ordained that the &s;y&s;tem of crea|tion &s;hould be frail, and with all other objects that human life &s;hould be tran&s;itory. If we be con|vinced of the wi&s;dom of GOD in determining that the heavens &s;hould wax old as a garment, and the foundations of the earth be removed, and that all
<PB N="8" REF="038196_0006_101141C26292D098">
the human race &s;hould die; then we may reconcile with wi&s;dom his removing particular per&s;ons from life; for in the&s;e in&s;tances he gives an example of the general &s;entence, and carries it, as it re&s;pects the human race, into effect.</P>
<P>SHOULD it be objected, that the time and circum|&s;tances of a per&s;on's death appear, in &s;ome in&s;tances, to militate again&s;t divine wi&s;dom in the production of it? To this it may be replied, that what is con|&s;idered the weakne&s;s and frailty of man in old age, is nothing more than the appointment <HI>that he shall die,</HI> exhibited in example. There is no nece&s;&s;ity, in the con&s;titution of his nature, that he &s;hould be|come feeble at three&s;core years and ten, or that he &s;hould be at all impaired by age, more than that the Sun, by continuing to &s;hine, &s;hould finally lo&s;e his lu&s;tre. Indeed, but for experience, it would be thought more &s;trange that the &s;un, a va&s;t body of fire, &s;hould be kept burning for many thou&s;and years, without the lea&s;t apparent diminution, than that the human body &s;hould be &s;u&s;tained in vigor, forever.</P>
<P>IF it be owing &s;olely to the decree of death, that man becomes feeble and helple&s;s at a certain age, then it may con&s;i&s;t with divine wi&s;dom, that he &s;hould experience &s;ickne&s;s and death in an earlier &s;ea&s;on. If the decree find man in vigor, though a thou&s;and years old&mdash;intere&s;ted in a variety of relations, en|gaged in important labors, with &s;cenes of enjoyment and hope around him, GOD alone can determine when that vigor &s;hall abate, when tho&s;e relations &s;hall be di&s;&s;olved, and tho&s;e pro&s;pects clo&s;ed. To plead the importance of relations and pur&s;uits again&s;t the time of removal de&s;ignated in Divine Providence, may ever delay the &s;troke of death, and is an implied claim to immortality on earth. If wi&s;dom be ex|pre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="9" REF="038196_0007_101141C59873E340">
in the general &s;entence of death, it is doubt|le&s;s expre&s;&s;ed in the particular time and circum|&s;tances in which it is executed.</P>
<P>IT may further be ob&s;erved, that if death be the appointment of GOD, it is &s;ub&s;ervient to infinite goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE goodne&s;s of GOD is as unque&s;tionable as his wi&s;dom, or power. In the permi&s;&s;ion of &s;in, and in all the evils which re&s;ult from it, he was influ|enced by benevolence as truly as in the creation of the world. Unle&s;s he were, there is a contrariety in his character; or he is le&s;s glorious and excellent in the government of creatures than in giving them exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>IT is a&s;&s;erted in &s;cripture, <HI>Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof,</HI> Eccles. vii.8.&mdash; Exi&s;tence is good, or evil, chiefly in reference to its objects. If GOD do not exerci&s;e goodne&s;s in gov|erning, he exerci&s;ed none in creating. Unle&s;s it were his object that creatures &s;hould be &s;ub&s;ervient to wi&s;e and holy purpo&s;es, no advantages would re|&s;ult from their exi&s;tence: for however curiou&s;ly they might be formed, or liberally endowed, their end would be vain, and thus their organization and endowments would be u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>THE object of GOD in governing is the highe&s;t general good. In pur&s;uing this he indulges no re|&s;pect of per&s;ons; but is impartial, ju&s;t and uncon|trolable. The condition of no one on earth, nor of any creature in the univer&s;e is the &s;ame, as if his intere&s;t were alone con&s;ulted: as if it were the &s;ole object of GOD to exalt him, and promote his ad|vantage.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="038196_0008_101141C85AFED7C8">CREATURES are viewed by GOD not as &s;eparate individuals, but in a collective capacity, and are all &s;ubordinated to the greate&s;t good. By this the ex|perience of each one is determined, whether pro&s;per|ous, or adver&s;e: whether life, or death.</P>
<P>TO choo&s;e the accompli&s;hment of this object, and voluntarily to conform to it, is a univer&s;al duty, and in this con&s;i&s;t the highe&s;t dignity, and the highe&s;t happine&s;s of which a creature is capable. In the temper here defined a per&s;on will be willing to live, or die, as GOD &s;hall determine: he will be happy in the ble&s;&s;ings with which he is favored, and content to re&s;ign them when required in Divine Providence: he will acquie&s;ce in the removal of his friends, in the calamities which befal the world, and in all the evils of which creatures are the &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>AS the general is &s;uperior to individual good, and is ever pur&s;ued by GOD, death in being inflict|ed by him in &s;ub&s;ervience to this, is &s;ub&s;ervient to good, even the highe&s;t of which we can conceive.</P>
<P>HAVING attempted to illu&s;trate the text, by con|&s;idering the certainty and univer&s;ality of death, and that it is a di&s;pen&s;ation of infinite wi&s;dom and bene|volence, productive in every in&s;tance, of the greate&s;t good, I would conclude my di&s;cour&s;e with an</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="application">
<HEAD><HI>IMPROVEMENT</HI> of the subject.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. WE may infer, that we cannot place depend|ance on life.</P>
<P>IT is not only certain that we <HI>shall be brought to</HI> DEATH, <HI>and to the house appointed for</HI> ALL <HI>living;</HI> but of the time, or manner of our removal, we are ignorant. The&s;e will be determined, not by our
<PB N="11" REF="038196_0009_101141CB5F21D558">
connections in this &s;tate; but by our relation to GOD and his government. We may be &s;pared for years, or may &s;oon be taken. It is our duty to con|&s;ider our frailty, and not depend on life; but be devoted to the divine will.</P>
<P N="2">2. WE may infer, that it is improper to place confidence in any of our acquaintance and friends.</P>
<P>INNUMERABLE are the te&s;timonies given in Divine Providence, that the mo&s;t intimate relations mu&s;t be di&s;&s;olved: that per&s;ons of &s;kill and genero&s;ity, of eminence and great u&s;efulne&s;s, mu&s;t be removed. Of this we have witne&s;&s;ed a number of in&s;tances: but few have been &s;o impre&s;&s;ive as the one which lately took place among us; by which not only a family is overwhelmed in &s;orrow, but the town is &s;en&s;ible of a lo&s;s.</P>
<P>HE is ju&s;tly to be regretted, as a man &s;u&s;taining many important relations,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He left an affectionate wife and five children&mdash;was honorary Member of the Philadelphia and London Medical Societies, and President of the <HI>Cincinnati,</HI> of this State.</NOTE> and of a great, generous, humane &s;pirit. He will be lamented as a hu&s;band, father, and benefactor: He will be regretted as at the head of a cla&s;s of citizens, di&s;tingui&s;hed for their exer|tions in the late revolutionary war, and on whom de|pendence is placed in the future emergencies of the country, among whom he pre&s;ided with affectionate &s;olicitude and dignity. He will be deeply regretted, as eminent in the very u&s;eful and important profe&s;&s;ion in which he was exten&s;ively employed; and for which he was qualified, not only by the acutene&s;s of his di&s;cernment and accuracy of his opinions&mdash;by his deci&s;ion and judgment; but by a choice of the mo&s;t in&s;tructive books, an exten&s;ive corre&s;pondence, and great experience.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="038196_0010_101141CE20291010">THE Mini&s;ters in general of the Town received his prompt, his vigilant, his patient attention, in the hour of affliction and di&s;ea&s;e, to them&s;elves and fami|lies, without any claim of compen&s;ation:&mdash;and this tribute is doubtle&s;s &s;mall, compared with the one due to his kindne&s;s and liberality in other in&s;tances.</P>
<P>SUCH was the general confidence in his &s;kill, that &s;ome might think, under his care, they were in a peculiar degree &s;ecure from death. But this confi|dence was vain&mdash;his own life he could not prolong: and in his removal in &s;o early a part of exi&s;tence we are taught <HI>his</HI> dependence, <HI>our</HI> dependence, and the dependence of all things on <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P N="3">3. FROM the &s;ubject we learn the nature of re&s;ig|nation, and the rea&s;onablene&s;s of the principle.</P>
<P>TRUE re&s;ignation is founded on a belief, not that man, from a nece&s;&s;ity of nature, mu&s;t die; but that this and every change is appointed, and carried into effect by GOD: in a belief, not that our particular wi&s;hes and intere&s;ts are con&s;ulted; but that the highe&s;t good is promoted.&mdash;It implies &s;en&s;ibilities corre&s;ponding to the nature of events; but, both in what is plea&s;ing and in what is afflictive, that we &s;ub|mit with chearfulne&s;s to the divine will.</P>
<P>ON this principle we may &s;afely re&s;t all the inte|re&s;ts of exi&s;tence, for it is the &s;um of all its duties, and the temper is a foundation for the highe&s;t joy, and for peace in every trial and adver&s;ity. In this temper we &s;hall be &s;upported in the experience of death our|&s;elves &mdash;&s;upported in the lo&s;s of tho&s;e much dearer than life. It will be the language of our hearts&punc; <HI>It is the Lord,</HI> the infinitely wi&s;e and ju&s;t and compa&s;|&s;ionate GOD, <HI>let him do what seemeth him good.&mdash;The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away: blessed be the name of the Lord.</HI></P>

<P>MOSES was the fir&s;t of Prophets and Legi&s;lators: Aaron the mo&s;t venerable of Prie&s;ts: Jo&s;hua the mo&s;t intrepid, regular and &s;ucce&s;sful of Generals: Samuel the mo&s;t equitable of Judges: David the mo&s;t paternal and pious of Kings, and Solomon the wi&s;e&s;t of men.</P>
<P>THE characters which aro&s;e in that nation, will not only appear with lu&s;tre to the end of time; but are a model to which &s;ucceeding generations may be referred, for greatne&s;s in civil rule, in war, and in piety.</P>
<P>IN the reign of Saul, and part of the reign of David, there was a per&s;on of di&s;tinction, Abner, the &s;on of Ner, Saul's Uncle. After Saul was inve&s;ted with regal authority, he appointed Abner, Captain
<PB N="6" REF="038196_0018_101141E4A1F0D7C0">
of his ho&s;t. His talents were tried in a variety of enterprizes, again&s;t Moab, again&s;t Ammon, again&s;t Edom, again&s;t Zohath, again&s;t the Phili&s;tines and again&s;t the Amalakites; and his &s;pirit and good con|duct ju&s;tified the appointment; <HI>he was a valiant man,</HI> and there was <HI>none like</HI> him <HI>in all Israel.</HI></P>
<P>ON the death of Saul, though the right of govern|ment belonged to David, but one tribe acknowledg|ed him, that of Judah. Abner, from his reputation and great influence, was the mo&s;t proper per&s;on to attempt the reconciliation of the other tribes: and having made a &s;olemn league with David, he re|ceived a commi&s;&s;ion and entered on the bu&s;i|ne&s;s. &mdash;But before he had proceeded far on the journey, Joab, Captain of the ho&s;t of David, &s;ent for him in the name of the King, and as he returned met him, and taking him a&s;ide, treacherou&s;ly &s;lew him.</P>
<P>DAVID greatly lamented his death. He appoint|ed an honorable burial, and followed the bier: and in the language of our text, addre&s;&s;ed his Officers and the People, <HI>Know ye not that there is a Prince and a Great Man fallen this day in Israel?</HI></P>
<P>THIS country, like the ancient Jewi&s;h Nation, has been ble&s;&s;ed with characters, eminent in civil and religious offices: di&s;tingui&s;hed as State&s;men and Divines; as Legi&s;lators, Philo&s;ophers, Judges, and Generals. It would be pre&s;umptuous as it were vain, to attempt to point them out, or exhibit the proofs of their talents, their virtues and u&s;efulne&s;s.</P>
<P>OUR attention is, at this time, called to <HI>one,</HI> not only on account of his di&s;tingui&s;hed greatne&s;s and excellence; but the afflictive event of his death.&mdash;
<PB N="7" REF="038196_0019_101141E7D3343E98">
So publicly known, &s;o illu&s;trious, &s;o beloved was <HI>Washington,</HI> that the pathetic exclamation mu&s;t ex|pre&s;s the &s;entiments and feelings of every heart, <HI>Know ye not, that there is a Prince, and a Great Man, fallen this day in</HI> our <HI>Israel!</HI></P>
<P>JUSTLY to delineate his virtues and endowments, would be a difficult ta&s;k in the calme&s;t hours of re|flection; but is much too critical to be executed un|der the confu&s;ed and tumultuous pre&s;&s;ure of grief.&mdash; The rationality of our &s;orrows, and the duty of reli|giou&s;ly improving them, require that we pay a gene|ral attention to his character.</P>
<P>HE may truly be &s;tiled <HI>great,</HI> if abilities to di&s;|charge the duties of the mo&s;t important &s;tations in &s;ociety con&s;titute greatne&s;s.</P>
<P>NOT to take a more di&s;tant retro&s;pect&mdash;in the commencement of the revolutionary war he was appointed to the chief command of the armies of the country. Not long after, Congre&s;s, "maturely con|&s;idering the cri&s;is, and having perfect reliance in his wi&s;dom, vigor and uprightne&s;s," inve&s;ted him with extraordinary powers; which were renewed from time to time, &s;o long as the exigency of affairs ren|dered it nece&s;&s;ary.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Journals of Congress, Dec. <HI>27, 1776;</HI> Nov. <HI>14,</HI> Dec. <HI>10, 1777,</HI> and April <HI>23, 1778.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>THE ju&s;tice of this reliance, and the ability with which he executed the tru&s;t, are evident from the &s;upport and di&s;cipline of the army, and its various and important operations in the cour&s;e of eight cam|paigns: and from the i&s;&s;ue of its &s;ucce&s;&s;es, in the ac|knowledgment of our Sovereignty and Independ|ence, and the return of peace.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="038196_0020_101141EA956C4890">HIS greatne&s;s, as General, compri&s;ed courage and &s;kill, moderation and enterprize, and re&s;ources of mind &s;uited to &s;ea&s;ons and circum&s;tances. His courage was not le&s;s to be doubted, than his prudence was con&s;picuous. He hazarded no intere&s;ts by ra&s;hne&s;s: he lo&s;t no advantages by delay. He was patient in trials, fortunate in deci&s;ions, had great &s;elf command &mdash;was great in his authority over others, and di&s;tin|gui&s;hed for di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s and humanity.</P>
<P>BY his public communications and example, he relieved the country from many di&s;couragements, and in &s;ea&s;ons of embarra&s;&s;ment and danger was the greate&s;t &s;upport of its hopes; and animated his fellow-citizens in arms, &s;haring their burdens, recon|ciling their differences, directing their ardor to ob|jects mo&s;t u&s;eful to the Country and conducive to <HI>their</HI> honor, teaching them effectually to pre&s;erve the character of <HI>citizens</HI> in the armour of <HI>soldiers.</HI></P>
<P>IT was not the maje&s;ty of his appearance, the light|ning of his eye, nor the high authority of his commi&s;|&s;ion, that influenced the troops to endure hard&s;hips and meet the enemy with fortitude&mdash;it was a &s;en&s;e of the union of the mo&s;t endearing virtues in his heart, with the mo&s;t enlightened &s;kill: a conviction that in their General they had a Father, who was &s;oli|citous to mitigate their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and in toils and dangers would appear at their head; and that in the love of him they loved their Country&mdash;it was the&s;e &s;entiments and feelings, which rendered them pa|tient in &s;ufferings, and in the day of battle in&s;pired them with &s;uch courage, that though their bodies might be cut down, their &s;pirit could not be &s;ubdued.</P>
<P>HE was great, not only in the character of <HI>General</HI>; but, when the nece&s;&s;ity of military labours was over, in retiring to the rank of a <HI>private citizen.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="038196_0021_101141ED58193468">WITH the highe&s;t objects of per&s;onal grandeur and authority that ever &s;timulated ambition, and with peculiar advantages to &s;ecure tho&s;e objects, that like an affectionate, faithful &s;on, he &s;hould bow to the au|thority of his Country, rejoicing only in her protec|tion and e&s;teem, laying at her feet tho&s;e honors which kings could not confer, nor take from him&mdash;was an act of greatne&s;s which &s;anctified his former exer|tions and atchievements, and gave the faire&s;t lu&s;tre to his character.</P>
<P>CONSIDERED in his political capacity and as a <HI>civil Ruler,</HI> he was likewi&s;e great.</P>
<P>HE mu&s;t early have been di&s;tingui&s;hed in this re|&s;pect, to be cho&s;en to the fir&s;t Congre&s;s which con|vened on the grievances and intere&s;ts of the Coun|try.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chosen a Delegate by the then Colony of Virginia, Aug. <HI>5, 1774.</HI>&mdash;Took his seat in Congress, Sept. <HI>5, 1774.</HI></NOTE> His character is more fully illu&s;trated in his numerous letters, and other writings: it is &s;till more highly atte&s;ted in his being a member and Pre&s;ident of the Convention by which our pre&s;ent Con&s;titution of Government was formed;&mdash;but it is mo&s;t clearly di&s;played in his admini&s;tration as Pre&s;ident of the United States.</P>
<P>THAT he &s;upported this high Office with dignity, and faithfully executed its very important and com|plicated duties, not only the voice of the con&s;tituted authorities, and of the country at large; but the pro&s;perity of the country is a te&s;timony.</P>
<P>HE was the <HI>first</HI> Pre&s;ident on the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of Government. Under him, the public regulations in general, in our internal and external relations, were adju&s;ted: tho&s;e officers who have conducted,

and continue to conduct, the public bu&s;ine&s;s, with &s;o much di&s;cretion, vigilance and integrity, were appointed: that decree of neutrality, which has pre|vented our being involved in the perils and expen|ces of a fruitle&s;s war, was promulged&mdash;and our relations to foreign nations &s;ettled, in a manner as conducive as po&s;&s;ible to our pro&s;perity and peace.</P>
<P>A FURTHER in&s;tance of his greatne&s;s appears, after he had retired from public &s;ervice, in his ac|cepting the command of the forces, to be rai&s;ed for the &s;upport of our rights and privileges as Citizens, and the defence of the country.</P>
<P>WHEN he had labored, with little intermi&s;&s;ion, for a long time in the mo&s;t arduous fields of public action; when he had long borne the weight of pub|lic cares and intere&s;ts, even till he had become old and grey headed: and when, from confidence in the ability and experience of others, he had re&s;igned his public Office, and withdrawn to the &s;hade of his patrimonial dwelling&mdash;that, at the appearance of danger, and his country's call, he &s;hould again come forth&punc; that he &s;hould ari&s;e from his &s;eat and gird on his armour, willing to &s;acrifice the repo&s;e of his la&s;t days to the public good&mdash;was an in&s;tance of great|ne&s;s, not exceeded in any of his former actions, and which only &s;uch peculiar circum&s;tances admit of being exhibited to view.</P>
<P>IT may further be ob&s;erved, that he was great in <HI>reputation,</HI> and in <HI>influence.</HI></P>
<P>HIS <HI>fame went into all lands, and the fear of him was upon all nations,</HI> 1 Chron. xiv.17.&mdash;No other per&s;on on earth was &s;o univer&s;ally loved and re&s;pect|ed. His influence was particularly great in this
<PB N="11" REF="038196_0023_101141F2DFCE6908">
country. Many, who appear to mi&s;take the public intere&s;ts, were convinced of his merit; and though not apprehending the force of his example in obey|ing the laws, li&s;tened to his advice and approved of his conduct and opinions. As <HI>Abner,</HI> from his cha|racter and reputation, might manage the tribes of I&s;rael as he plea&s;ed; and as it was &s;aid of <HI>David,</HI> on a certain occa&s;ion, II Sam. iii, 36, that <HI>all the people took notice</HI> of his behaviour, <HI>and it pleased them; as whatever the king did pleased all the people:</HI> &s;o it may be &s;aid, the people were di&s;po&s;ed to ob&s;erve the words and actions of <HI>Washington</HI>; and all that he &s;aid, or did, gave general &s;atisfaction. His opinion, with few exceptions, was the public &s;entiment, and re|gulated the public will.</P>
<P>THIS confidence re&s;ulted, not only from his di&s;|tingui&s;hed endowments and reputation: but from the <HI>integrity</HI> of his heart. No one could accu&s;e him of a wrong intention; or mi&s;tru&s;ted, that he would be bia&s;&s;ed by &s;elf-intere&s;t, or party zeal, or any other perver&s;e and injurious principle.</P>
<P>INDEED, my afflicted, re&s;pected Auditors, if any thing great in its nature, or con&s;equences, have taken place in the political experience of this coun|try, &s;ince <HI>Washington</HI> came on the &s;tage of action, then he was great: for he was the chief in&s;trument, in the hand of Heaven, of accompli&s;hing the events, and effecting the changes, for which that epoch is di&s;tingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>IF it were great, for an infant people to a&s;&s;ert their own rights, and tho&s;e of mankind; and to op|po&s;e one of the mo&s;t formidable, and to us, before, the mo&s;t venerated of earthly powers: then was

<HI>Washington</HI> great; for he a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the coun&s;el, and took command of our armies.</P>
<P>IF it were great, for a people to form and amica|bly agree in a Con&s;titution of general Government, comprehending a great diver&s;ity of di&s;po&s;itions, manners and habits, and harmonizing an infinite variety of intere&s;ts: a con&s;titution the boa&s;t of our country and rea&s;on, and beneficial to mankind as an example of regard, in freemen, to order and civil rule, then was <HI>Washington</HI> great: for in that au|gu&s;t Convention, where this Con&s;titution was form|ed, he Pre&s;ided.</P>
<P>IF it were great, to introduce the operation of this new &s;y&s;tem of government; to execute the highe&s;t Office, with approbation and applau&s;e, and leave an example, which it is one of the fir&s;t wi&s;hes, both for the good of the country and <HI>their</HI> honor, that his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors may imitate, then was <HI>Washington</HI> great: for with his admini&s;tration, the operation of the Con|&s;titution commenced; and on his final re&s;ignation, the public regret was more expre&s;&s;ive, than their profu&s;e applau&s;es, of the ability with which he had di&s;charged its duties.</P>
<P>IF it were great, for a per&s;on advanced in years, and worn with labour, and ble&s;&s;ed with the privileges of dome&s;tic peace, to return to public &s;ervice; to take the command of a <HI>patriotic</HI> army, to guard the liber|ties and government of the country&punc; to re&s;i&s;t, if nece&s;|&s;ary, a perverted, licentious, threatening <HI>world</HI> in arms&mdash;then was <HI>Washington</HI> great; for, from the calm retreat, where he hoped to clo&s;e his days, he came at the call of his country. Her dangers, and the thought of meeting her &s;ons, with here and there a veteran, in the field, &s;trengthened his knees, and
<PB N="13" REF="038196_0025_101141F86188F218">
invigorated his arm, renewing <HI>his youth like the ea|gle's:</HI> and he was &s;till con&s;idered the &s;afe&s;t of guides, and our greate&s;t earthly defence.</P>
<P>HIS character, in the various &s;tations and lights in which it has been viewed, was great. Had he appeared in only one of them, he would have been thought di&s;tingui&s;hed. How is his greatne&s;s enhan|ced when his character is collectively con&s;idered!</P>
<P>HIS talents mu&s;t have been pre-eminent. He mu&s;t have been formed by Heaven, to give an example of greatne&s;s and goodne&s;s&mdash;expre&s;&s;ive of divine benevo|lence&punc; u&s;eful to us and in&s;tructive to the human race. Of true greatne&s;s, goodne&s;s is the &s;upport and lu&s;tre. The greatne&s;s of this per&s;on was connected with good|ne&s;s, and the re&s;ult of it. He appears to have acted with a view to the approbation of con&s;cience, enlight|ed by a belief of the being and &s;uperintending provi|dence and government of God, and the principles and repre&s;entations of the Go&s;pel: and his character, in its di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s and genero&s;ity, its utility, its &s;elf-diffidence, its deci&s;ion, its piety, its faithfulne&s;s and glory, is a &s;triking example of what is the object of the Go&s;pel to produce.</P>
<P>THIS character is removed from among us. <HI>Know ye not, that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in</HI> our <HI>Israel! Washington</HI> is dead! Let us pau&s;e a moment&mdash;Our feelings are chilled at the reflection&mdash;utterance fails me.</P>
<P>&mdash;BUT we have a&s;&s;embled in the hou&s;e of God to con&s;ider and improve this afflictive di&s;pen&s;ation of providence<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> and it mu&s;t be the</P>

<P>IF the divine favor were expre&s;&s;ed, in rai&s;ing up &s;uch a per&s;on, and continuing him for &s;uch important purpo&s;es, that he &s;hould be taken away is a cha&s;ti&s;e|ment; and ought to be deplored, as we &s;hould feel the afflictive hand of Heaven.</P>
<P>AS we venerated and admired his talents and vir|tues, we mu&s;t lament his removal: for though in its con&s;equences an infinite acqui&s;ition, as we tru&s;t and and believe to him, the evil to us is great: we &s;hall behold his face, be in&s;tructed by his coun&s;els, bene|fitted by his exertions no more.</P>
<P>THE love of our Country ju&s;tifies our &s;orrow at his death. Great to her were the advantages of his character in what he had done, and might do. He was not only a chief in&s;trument of the political ble&s;|&s;ings we enjoy, and the head of our military forces; but more than any other individual character a cen|tre of union to all cla&s;&s;es of citizens; and might be an important means of prolonging our peace, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> our pro&s;perity.

<P>THIS event likewi&s;e exhibits in an impre&s;&s;ive light, that we &s;hould not place our confidence in man.</P>
<P>IN all ages, the great and good have, with other characters, been brought to death. <HI>Our fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever?</HI> The grave is <HI>without any order:</HI> the <HI>great</HI> and <HI>small</HI> are there. Abner, the important character and chief General mentioned in our &s;ubject, was prematurely &s;lain. David, who lamented him, and was far his &s;uperior in virtues and &s;tation, became old and final|ly gave up the gho&s;t. <HI>Washington,</HI> who has long been a &s;ubject of public confidence, an object of pub|lic admiration and e&s;teem, is gone. <HI>Man is not to be accounted of, whose breath is in his nostrils. The days of his years are threescore years and ten: and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years; yet is their strength, labor and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we flee away.</HI> From the frailty of human life, we ought not to rely on man. If we cannot depend on his exi&s;tence, it is evident we cannot depend on his exertions for our good.</P>
<P>THE &s;ubject further teaches, the rea&s;on for gra|titude, that the character we have con&s;idered was brought into exi&s;tence, and &s;o long continued.</P>
<P>SUCH a character was of great importance&mdash;was nece&s;&s;ary to our welfare, as a people. It was an act of great goodne&s;s in GOD, that he &s;hould form his
<PB N="16" REF="038196_0028_101141FFBAB59E08">
&s;ervant with &s;uch endowments, and lead the public mind to ob&s;erve them: that he &s;hould continue his &s;ervant through a &s;eries of trials; &s;upport him in his <HI>labors,</HI> till he had arrived at old age, and in his u&s;e|fulne&s;s till death.</P>
<P>IN &s;ome in&s;tances per&s;ons of talents, and capable of promoting the public welfare, are not di&s;criminat|ed. They are like tho&s;e flowers which, in the lan|guage of the Poet, are
<Q><L>"&mdash;born to blush, unseen;</L>
<L>"And waste their sweetness on the desert air."</L></Q></P>
<P>IN &s;ome in&s;tances, when called into action, and public expectations are excited, and the public con|fidence engaged, they are prematurely cut down, either by treachery, or di&s;ea&s;e, and thus are like chil|dren <HI>carried from the cradle to the grave.</HI> But the talents of this per&s;on did not e&s;cape public ob&s;erva|tion: and he was continued in public office till his principles and modes of conduct could be a&s;certain|ed, and marked; forming an example, in fair and full proportion, calculated to in&s;truct and engage imitation.</P>
<P>WE have likewi&s;e rea&s;on for gratitude, that he was left to no action by which his reputation would be fullied, and his example rendered pernicious.&mdash; Many per&s;ons outlive their characters; but his was uniform till <HI>death</HI> put the &s;eal upon it, and precluded the po&s;&s;ibility of its being tarni&s;hed. The public eye will ever behold it with admiration and plea&s;ure, and the imitation of it will conduce to individual great|ne&s;s and excellence, and the general good.</P>
<P>FINALLY, the &s;ubject, in its various parts, enforces the duty of tru&s;ting alone in GOD.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="038196_0029_10114204B530A748">WHEN a created being is removed, the divine arm is not &s;hortened: to think it is, implies that we viewed the creature in the place of the Creator. When a created being is removed, he, indeed, is deprived of ability to a&s;&s;i&s;t us; but the ability of God is not impaired. He is infinite and unchange|able: the &s;ource of all power and goodne&s;s. As di&s;tingui&s;hed public characters are a te&s;timony of his merciful agency, &s;o their removal &s;hould lead us to make him the &s;ole object of confidence.&mdash;In this temper, we may be certain of his &s;upport and pro|tection.</P>
<P>THAT he is able to relieve and ble&s;s, appears, not only from his infinite perfection, and from his forming characters, once u&s;eful and important; but from his rai&s;ing up others to &s;upply the place of the&s;e, when removed. In many in&s;tances, when great and in|fluential characters were taken from the people of I&s;rael, and they appeared in danger of anarchy and ruin, the Lord interpo&s;ed, and pre&s;erved them in or|der and peace. When Mo&s;es died, Jo&s;hua was cal|led to the command: when Elijah was taken, his <HI>spirit rested on Elisha:</HI> when David &s;lept with his fathers, Solomon was e&s;tabli&s;hed on his throne: and reigned with wi&s;dom and glory, and in peace. The &s;ame divine power and goodne&s;s which formed <HI>Washington,</HI> may ble&s;s us with continued advantages in other characters, and increa&s;e our pro&s;perity and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>THE welfare of our Country is an object too dear and important to be re&s;igned, but from nece&s;&s;ity:&mdash; and added to the pre&s;ent lo&s;s, would render it truly overwhelming. If it were a maxim with heathens, that "no one ought to de&s;pair re&s;pecting the Re|public;" it is &s;till more improper that we &s;hould de|&s;pair

as Chri&s;tians&mdash;as &s;ubjects of the highe&s;t civil and religious privileges.</P>
<P>UNGRATEFUL would it be, not to perceive and acknowledge, the various te&s;timonies, which GOD is yet giving, in favour of our &s;upport.</P>
<P>IT was a ble&s;&s;ing, in this &s;en&s;e, that the per&s;on we this day lament, was not taken while at the head of government; but from a &s;tation, where his example of obedience to the laws is calculated to &s;trengthen, rather than interupt the public harmony.</P>
<P>WE have rea&s;on to be thankful, in this &s;en&s;e, for the Con&s;titution of general government; which is now e&s;tabli&s;hed, and is armed with power to &s;ilence faction, as well as repel foreign inva&s;ion.</P>
<P>WE have likewi&s;e a te&s;timony of divine goodne&s;s in the character of the pre&s;ent Chief Magi&s;trate, the <HI>President</HI> of the <HI>United States</HI>; to who&s;e hands <HI>Wash|ington,</HI> with &s;atisfaction, &s;aw the reigns of government committed; and in who&s;e high talents, and tried integrity, and regard to religion, we may not only be a&s;&s;ured of a faithful and honorable di&s;charge of the duties of that office, but the beneficial influence of an example, far more exten&s;ive than his authority.</P>

<P>MAY the Lord &s;anctify his example, and his death, to the&s;e important purpo&s;es. May he ble&s;s the vir|tuous <HI>Relict</HI> of his decea&s;ed &s;ervant: and be her God and never failing portion&mdash;and &s;upport with his favor, the particular connections, under this bereavement. May he ble&s;s the Pre&s;ident of the United States, grant|ing him the light of his countenance and his direction. May he ble&s;s all our Rulers and Officers, with the people of the country, and build us up as a nation.&mdash; May he &s;ubdue the &s;pirit of &s;in and violence, and mi|tigate the evils which re&s;ult from it; and cau&s;e the earth to be the &s;uburbs of that glorious &s;tate, where love has univer&s;al influence, and peace eternal reigns &mdash;where all tears are wiped forever from the eye, and the righteous re&s;t in the bo&s;om of God.</P>
