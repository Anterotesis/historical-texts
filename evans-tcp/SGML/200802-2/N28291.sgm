<P>HE DIED IN A GOOD OLD AGE, FULL OF DAYS, RICHES AND HONOUR.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the cour&s;e of the Providential di&s;pen&s;ations of Almighty God, our nation is called to contemplate an event, which arre&s;ts the powers, and awakens the mo&s;t pathetic &s;en&s;ibilities of the human heart. Alrea|dy, for a con&s;iderable time, have our eyes witne&s;&s;ed the tokens of general mourning, and our ears been a&s;&s;ailed with the language of public grief. From ev|ery part of our common country, does the plaint of &s;orrow ari&s;e, and every gale, as it pa&s;&s;es by, is loaded with the groans and &s;ighs of a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed people. Not only do our &s;anctuaries of ju&s;tice and of law, and our &s;acred a&s;ylums of religion, mourn; not only do our officers of &s;tate, our di&s;tingui&s;hed citizens, and the war-worn veteran, appear in the badges of woe; but all, from the aged who remembers the deeds of former times, to the youth who anticipates the future; all of
<PB N="6" REF="037709_0005_100EF1AF12BA24C8">
every de&s;cription and every rank, feel an oppre&s;&s;ive heavine&s;s at the heart. And, when we look around upon this great and re&s;pectable a&s;&s;embly, and mark the eye &s;uddenly &s;uffu&s;ed with the tear of &s;ad recol|lection; when e&s;pecially we reflect that on <HI>this</HI> day, a whole nation, moved by the impul&s;e of one great &s;or|row, is engaged in the ob&s;ervance of &s;olemnites, of which the&s;e before us form a part, we are con&s;trained to conclude, that &s;ome di&s;a&s;trous change has occurred, that &s;ome dreadful lo&s;s has been &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>What then thou nation highly favored of heaven! what has produced this univer&s;al appearance of di&s;|tre&s;s? From thy loftie&s;t mountains, and thy lovelie&s;t vales, why a&s;cends to the &s;ky, the plaintive concert of <HI>weeping, lamentation</HI> and <HI>woe</HI>? Has the enemy rolled like a flood upon thy peaceful &s;hores, and threatened to deluge with crimes and blood, thine exten&s;ive plains? Are thine old men devoted to death, thy daughters to &s;hame, thy &s;ons to &s;lavery? Has the arm of tyranny &s;eized upon thy rights, and extingui&s;hed the hallowed flame upon thine altars of freedom?&mdash; No!&mdash;But the leader of our armies&mdash;the founder of our infant republic&mdash;the guide of our councils&mdash;the patriot, who united and &s;wayed all hearts&mdash;is no more! The great, the illu&s;trious WASHINGTON, the pride of his country, the ornament of mankind&mdash;&s;leeps in du&s;t!</P>
<P>Draw near, ye companions of his toils, ye who
<PB N="7" REF="037709_0006_100EF1B09AF07430">
fought by his &s;ide, who were animated by his patriot|i&s;m, and breathed his martial &s;pirit; draw near, ye coun&s;ellors, who &s;hone in the cabinet, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted his efforts by your wi&s;dom and your virtue; draw near, ye &s;ons and daughters of America, who&s;e &s;acred birth|right he defended with his &s;word, and guaranteed by the bulwark of his impregnable name; draw near, with &s;olemn &s;tep to his tomb. Here, behold once more, your hero, friend, father; and while the copious tear bedews your cheek, and the &s;trong beat of the heart, checks your utterance, look a long&mdash;a painful&mdash;a la&s;t adieu. Augu&s;t in death, "his form has not yet lo&s;t all her original greatne&s;s." Firmne&s;s, prudence, valor, re&s;ignation, &s;till are &s;eated upon that countenance, now fixed and pale, where they lately &s;hone in the mo&s;t vivid expre&s;&s;ion; for they pre&s;ided over all the emotions and energies of his heart. But the immortal <HI>&s;pirit has returned to God who gave it,</HI> and left the earthly habitation to a&s;&s;imilate with its native du&s;t. That eye no more beams on virtue, with the cheering ray of friend&s;hip; nor with its piercing glance, unnerves the &s;trength of vice, and overawes the confi|dence of ba&s;e ambition. That great heart, which al|ways beat in uni&s;on, with the impul&s;e of patrioti&s;m, and glowed with love for his country, is now lifele&s;s as the tongue of calumny, and cold as the clay which &s;urrounds it. His arm is deprived of its vigor, and his
<PB N="8" REF="037709_0007_100EF1B337577EE8">
&s;word, the terror of our foes, &s;leeps harmle&s;s at his &s;ide. That &s;ingular a&s;&s;emblage of virtues and of tal|ents, which con&s;tituted the unprecedented glory of his character&mdash;which was more than a ho&s;t for the defence of a nation's rights&mdash;more efficacious than the force of law, &s;anctioned with the dread of penalty, to repre&s;s the licentious daring of faction&mdash;and which, under the guidance and patronage of Providence, a&s;&s;erted our lib|erties, and achieved our independence&mdash;is now, unex|pectedly removed from the terre&s;trial &s;phere, which it illumined and adorned. It can now no longer be di&s;played in the wi&s;dom of coun&s;el, in the &s;plendor of action, in the con&s;ummation of great de&s;ign. Placed beyond our view, it flouri&s;hes and expands in tho&s;e regions where <HI>mortal puts on immortality,</HI> and perfection is added to perfection.</P>
<P>While therefore as men, and as Americans, we lament the lo&s;s which our country and the world has &s;u&s;tained, let us mingle the tears of joy with the tears of grief, and with the &s;adne&s;s of &s;orrow unite the &s;entiment of gratitude&mdash;that humanity is &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;uch ex|cellence, and that America can boa&s;t &s;uch a tran&s;cen|dant character, as appeared in that illu&s;trious per&s;on|age, who&s;e exit we deplore, but who&s;e pre-eminent greatne&s;s we can never cea&s;e to admire. Let us not forget to prai&s;e that Almighty and Merciful Being, who is good, both in what he gives and in what he
<PB N="9" REF="037709_0008_100EF1B5134FC960">
takes away. Let us thank him that WASHINGTON has been continued &s;o long with us; and that he has <HI>died in a good old age, full of days, riches and honor.</HI></P>
<P>Through numberle&s;s toils, and imminent dangers, he has been pre&s;erved, by the protection of Providence, to be a mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed in&s;trument of ble&s;&s;ings to his country. At the commencement of his bright ca|reer, at the origin of that grand movement, which gave birth to a nation, and laid the broad ba&s;is of a mighty empire; what impenetrable darkne&s;s hovered over the pro&s;pects of adventurous hope! What certain de&s;truction &s;eemed to threaten the bravery which &s;hould dare to re&s;i&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion! At that eventful cri|&s;is, when in&s;ult and wrong goaded a patient and &s;uf|fering people into de&s;peration, and urged them to &s;eek redre&s;s by an appeal to arms, America called up|on her WASHINGTON, and placed her intere&s;ts under his guardian&s;hip. Go, unfurl my banners&mdash;fight my battles&mdash;&s;eek the po&s;t of danger&mdash;gain la&s;ting renown by victory&mdash;or die, covered with glory. He bowed, and received the &s;hining blade from her hand, the in|&s;ignia of office from her authority, and the honor of high re&s;pon&s;ibility, from her unlimited confidence, in his virtue. Already does the lambent flame begin to play around his head&mdash;pledge of that &s;plendor which was &s;oon to irradiate and encircle his name. Already does his country feel the animation of hope, and an|ticipate
<PB N="10" REF="037709_0009_100EF1B7448E07E8">
an early and &s;ucce&s;sful i&s;&s;ue of the eventful conte&s;t.</P>
<P>But before this hope could be realized, he mu&s;t fir&s;t a&s;cend tho&s;e "&s;teep acclivities of fame," where the deathle&s;s laurel had never yet been plucked by mor|tal band. Who can ju&s;tly e&s;timate and duly prai&s;e that di&s;intere&s;ted and &s;ublime magnanimity, which, had it met with final defeat, mu&s;t have encountered death, and more hateful ignominy? For, the noble&s;t motives, the pure&s;t principles of action, and the very heaven of virtues, when mar&s;halled again&s;t ty|ranny, cannot fail to be dete&s;table to tyrants, and devoted to infamy by their adherents and their &s;laves. What would have been the unhappy fate of that hero, whom God and man now delight to honor, had not &s;ucce&s;s crowned his exertions, I leave you to ga|ther from the rewards of defeated patrioti&s;m, in other ages and among other nations. But nothing moves his firm mind. The danger of infamy vani&s;hes, and the hedious &s;pectacle of ignominious death, appears inve&s;ted with the badges of renown, when he turns his eye upon his country. The &s;cene before him is truly grand; but it is the grandeur of terror. It is the ocean tempe&s;ted into fury, and &s;hrowded with the mantle of &s;evenfold night! Such a &s;cene, nothing but fortitude, rendered invincible by tru&s;t in God, could have contemplated with compo&s;ure, much le&s;s have launched into it, with the dependant intere&s;ts of millions yet unborn.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="037709_0010_100ED3CDF8ACD1D0">A mighty kingdom, rich in re&s;ource, proud in the prowe&s;s of her arms, terrible to the nations of Eu|rope, pours into the bo&s;om of our country, her trained and intrepid bands.

He was the &s;pring which moved, the very &s;pirit which informed and actuated that &s;y&s;tem of mea&s;ures, which wrought our political redemption. Had he then fallen, who but could have predicted the di&s;a&s;trous con&s;equences? Then, you my fellow citizens, would have fallen&mdash; thou my country&mdash;never more to ri&s;e!

<P><PB N="13" REF="037709_0012_100EF1BC456E6180">He lived to &s;ee the pro&s;pects of hope brighten into reality. After experiencing the various fortunes of war, be &s;aw his country victorious; ri&s;e re&s;plendent among the nations, and repo&s;e upon the bo&s;om of peace. Through eight years of toil, embarra&s;&s;ment and blood; led by the unexampled per&s;everance, un|bending fortitude, unerring prudence, and ardent pat|rioti&s;m of her beloved WASHINGTON, &s;he advanced with augmented greatne&s;s, with increa&s;ing prowe&s;s and &s;plendor, to independence, liberty, glory. On her progre&s;s, the eyes of the ju&s;t and good, of every clime, were fixed, with the mo&s;t painful &s;olicitude. On the great re&s;ult, the nations of the earth gaze with growing wonder. Such a combination of virtues had been di&s;played; &s;uch feats of valor had been achieved; &s;uch exhau&s;tle&s;s hatred to tyranny, and &s;uch unquenchable love of liberty had pervaded the country, that the whole &s;eries of events connected with the revolution, and their &s;plendid con&s;ummation, proclaimed the di&s;tingui&s;hed interference of Heaven.</P>
<P>But while many partook of the acquired renown, WASHINGTON &s;hone the mo&s;t magnificent object of a nation's love, and a world's admiration.

<P>No! his &s;word thir&s;ted not for blood. His arm was not lifted up for conque&s;t. While he fought for the <HI>defence</HI> of all you hold mo&s;t dear, the havoc ne|ce&s;&s;ary for attaining &s;ucce&s;s, he &s;incerely deplored. Amid the din of arms, the carnage of death, and the hotte&s;t rage of battle, he li&s;tened to the <HI>&s;till &s;mall voice</HI> of humanity in his brea&s;t. In the mid&s;t of his mo&s;t bril|liant exploits, his eye was turned toward the &s;hades, and his heart panted for the tranquillity of dome&s;tic &s;cenes. He lived to gratify this ardent, inherent de&s;ire; and with the una&s;piring dignity of the fir&s;t of citizens, re|turned to his humble retirement, pur&s;ued by the tears, the prayers, the affections of an emancipated, a grateful people. There repo&s;e, thou magnanimous hero! There fea&s;t upon the &s;weet recollection of the pa&s;t, and the delightful hope of the future. There cultivate tho&s;e virtues which always governed thine own great heart; and cheri&s;h that divine religion, which afforded thee unfailing &s;upport in the &s;evere&s;t

<P>But no! Heaven &s;aw fit to counteract this predom|inant inclination&mdash;for the orb of his glory was not yet full.

His mo&s;t favorite pur&s;uits are in&s;tantly abandoned, and he appears once more, with the renewed and &s;welling-applau&s;e of the people whom he loved, on the &s;plen|did theatre of action. Again&mdash;but why need I rep|re&s;ent him pre&s;iding over tho&s;e deliberations of the collected wi&s;dom of America, which gave birth to a con&s;titution, free in its principles; wi&s;e in its divi|&s;ion, arrangement and balance of power; admirable for the energy which it communicates to authority, and for tho&s;e whole&s;ome re&s;traints, to which that au|thority is &s;ubjected: a con&s;titution, not only the ad|miration of the pre&s;ent age, but de&s;tined to command the reverence of po&s;terity, to the late&s;t generations?

&s;uffrage, to fill the chair of Chief Magi&s;trate; to give the fir&s;t impul&s;e to a grand and comprehen&s;ive &s;y&s;|tem; to enter upon a new and untried field of ope|rations; to expo&s;e his untarni&s;hed laurels to the mil|dew of calumny; and under the burden of encrea&s;ed years, to wield, to adju&s;t, to harmonize the various intere&s;ts of a widely-extended empire? Shall I endeav|or to delineate the features of that wi&s;dom, which was quick to di&s;cern, and of that prudence, which was prompt to pur&s;ue, the only path of &s;afety and honor, amid the jealou&s;ies and contentions of rival nations, and the commotions of the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing revolu|tion, that ever &s;hook and appalled the earth? Mu&s;t you be informed, that like the angel, "who rides in the whirlwind, and directs the &s;torm," he reigned over the inflamed pa&s;&s;ions of men; and by the mighty ma|gic of his influence, re&s;trained and a&s;&s;uaged the tem|pe&s;t of faction? Standing upon the broad ba&s;is of his own impregnable virtues, he could hear unmoved the cen&s;ures of mi&s;taken zeal, and pity, while his duty obliged him to oppo&s;e, that blind affection and &s;tu|pid gratitude, which would have plunged our country into the whirlpool of European politics? Need you be told, that he did not aim at popularity, riches, glo|ry; but that the invariable object of his pur&s;uit, was the real intere&s;ts of his country? Yes, Americans, the peace which we now enjoy, and the tranquillity with

which we are ble&s;&s;ed, are, under the kind Providence of Heaven, to be a&s;cribed to that anticipating wi&s;dom, that rectitude of principle, that undeviating ju&s;tice, which were con&s;picuous in all the prominent features of his admini&s;tration. And, whatever variety of &s;en|timent, excited by circum&s;tance, or produced by time, may have tran&s;iently prevailed in the brea&s;ts of his fellow-citizens, and diffu&s;ed a foreign tinge over the face of &s;ociety, the opinion was never uttered, nor <HI>con|ceived,</HI> which dared to impeach the invulnerable puri|ty of his intentions.</P>
<P>Though continually "admoni&s;hed by the increa&s;|ing weight of years, that the calm of retirement was as nece&s;&s;ary for him, as it would be welcome," yet he continues with unabated vigilance, and unwearied labor at his arduous po&s;t, until the improved &s;tate of things made his duty compatible with his repo&s;e. A|gain we &s;ee him &s;eek the &s;olitude on which his heart was unalterably &s;et. After communicating to you the maxims of &s;ound policy and the in&s;tructions of good advice, which were the re&s;ult of long experience and mature re&s;earch; and after expre&s;&s;ing the grate|ful &s;en&s;e which he entertained of his country's love, and calling down upon her bo&s;om the ble&s;&s;ings of the ETERNAL, he dive&s;ts him&s;elf of his high authority; and bowing under the va&s;t burden of his honors, re|tires beneath the &s;hades of Vernon&mdash;and &s;oon fini&s;h|ing
<PB N="19" REF="037709_0018_100EF1C8E5D8FED0">
his earthly cour&s;e, ari&s;es to receive his heavenly crown.</P>
<P>But he has departed <HI>in a good old age, full of days, riches and honor.</HI> The annals of nations are not adorned with &s;o illu&s;trious and fini&s;hed a character. We &s;ee and admire particular traits of excellence, in men of renown, who flouri&s;hed in the days of former times. But, which of them exhibits &s;uch a con&s;i&s;tent and harmonious whole, as is here pre&s;ented to our contemplation? To the &s;plendid round of official duties and civic virtues, which di&s;played them&s;elves, without effort, and without o&s;tentation, in the beau|tiful tenor of his life, he added as the crown of all, a regular and exemplary re&s;pect to the GOSPEL of JE|SUS; a uniform and &s;incere piety to GOD. Religion was the &s;tar of &s;uperior radiance, which reflected a cele&s;tial and inextingui&s;hable lu&s;tre through the con|&s;tellation of all his virtues. On every proper occa&s;ion, he acknowledges an overruling Providence, and a&s;|cribes to its guidance and defence, the &s;ucce&s;s of his efforts and the independence of his country.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">See his farewell orders to the Army.</NOTE> In his circular letters to the particular States, he &s;peaks in the highe&s;t terms of eulogy re&s;pecting the word of revelation, and in the highe&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of honor, re&s;pecting the Divine Redeemer. He knew that his talents and exaltation came from God, and he was
<PB N="20" REF="037709_0019_100EF1CA8C3B6C88">
not a&s;hamed to acknowledge before the world, the author of his benefactions. Hear him again, in his parting addre&s;s, dictated by the warme&s;t affection for his people, earne&s;tly inculcate, with all the fervor and authority of parental concern, the nece&s;&s;ity of morality and religion to the pro&s;perity of nations, and the nece&s;&s;ity of religion to the exi&s;tence of morality. He knew, from long experience, that their influence upon the &s;oul was a fea&s;t of delight. In the mid&s;t of his mo&s;t urgent employments, even during the tu|mults of war, you behold him con&s;ciencious and reg|ular in devoting a certain portion of every day to re|tirement. This uniform retreat, we have rea&s;on to believe was &s;acred to meditation and to God. The unhallowed foot of officious pre&s;umption, was forbid|den to intrude; and the &s;weet in&s;inuations of friend|&s;hip were never &s;uffered to &s;teal upon tho&s;e hours, con&s;ecrate to heaven. He &s;tands a monument for the admiration of the world, for the in&s;truction of fu|ture ages, for an example to heroes, legi&s;lators and kings.</P>
<P>I &s;peak not of tho&s;e wi&s;e political maxims, tho&s;e rules calculated to make a nation great and happy, which lie &s;cattered through his writings, but are more particularly bequeathed to us in his valedictory ad|dre&s;s. I need not repeat his animated exhortations to the ob&s;ervance of ju&s;tice, to the love of liberty, to
<PB N="21" REF="037709_0020_100EF1CD12492318">
the exten&s;ion of literature, to the exerci&s;e of fraternal affection, to the cultivation of the principles of our union. I need not mention his excellent advice, to guard again&s;t the poi&s;on of party a&s;perity; the &s;trat|agems of ever-working, ever lying faction; the dan|ger from cumbrous, unnece&s;&s;ary, overgrown military e&s;tabli&s;hments; the contagion of foreign influence, and the enchantment of intimate foreign connexion: for he, <HI>though dead, yet &s;peaketh,</HI> and his warning voice is heard in deep toned maje&s;ty from the tomb.</P>
<P>Fellow Citizens, he loved you to the la&s;t. He bore your intere&s;ts on his heart, when he encountered the ho&s;tility of peril. The welfare of his country, was the theme of his prayers, whenever he bowed in the pre&s;ence of his God. The recollection of her tri|umphs, and the pro&s;pect of her happine&s;s, &s;moothed the path of his age, and gilded the gloom of his de|parting hour.</P>
<P>Illu&s;trious &s;hade, farewell! fir&s;t of men, thy name is immortal. Father, Deliverer, Friend&mdash;the aged patriot mourns thy lo&s;s! The valiant youth, erewhile animated by thy virtues, looks with &s;peechle&s;s agony upon thy grave, and cla&s;ps his hands in the extacy of grief. Thy bereaved country, in vain &s;tretches forth her arms, to give thee a la&s;t embrace&mdash;Borne down by &s;orrow, &s;he re&s;ts again&s;t the tomb, which pre&s;erves the
<PB N="22" REF="037709_0021_100EF1CF3A032688">
a&s;hes of her departed chieftain. Father, Hero, Friend, once more farewell! Time, who &s;hall crumble into du&s;t, the monumental marble, which deathle&s;s grati|tude con&s;ecrates to thy memory, &s;hall continue to brighten the &s;plendors of thy fame; and WASHING|TON SHALL LIVE FOR EVER&mdash;in the HEARTS OF HIS COUNTRYMEN, and in the BOSOM OF HIS GOD.</P>
