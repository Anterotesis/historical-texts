<Q>KNOW YE NOT THAT THERE IS A PRINCE AND A GREAT MAN FALLEN THIS DAY IN ISRAEL.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SACRED are the &s;orrows for departed worth. Ju&s;t and manly is the &s;igh, which pa&s;&s;es from the bo&s;om at the remembrance of goodne&s;s and greatne&s;s expired.&mdash;When death diffu&s;es uncommon horror by laying his wa&s;teful hand upon wi&s;dom, valour, and every venerable excellence, when human nature lo&s;es its nobles, and a nation is in tears, it is virtue to weep; it is religion to be &s;ad. Oh, &s;ons of my country, ye cannot but mourn! Ye, daughters of America, ye are amiably in tears! For <HI>the beauty of our Israel is fallen</HI>&mdash;<HI>The staff of its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> is no more!</HI>&mdash;Death, giving his &s;tronge&s;t proof, that no great|ne&s;s can awe, nor entreaty divert him from his prey, has taken our <HI>Washington</HI> from among us; and we are left to &s;trive to &s;ooth our angui&s;h, by mu&s;ing upon his virtues, and paying our humble tribute to his name.</P>

ON this melancholy occa&s;ion, no words occur to me more &s;uitable to guide the meditations of our agitated minds, than the pa&s;&s;age I have &s;elected, for the motto of this di&s;cour&s;e. It is the tender lamentation of the de&s;tined ruler of I&s;rael, at the death of the Commander in Chief of their ho&s;ts. While &s;imilarity of characters gives pecu|liar pertinence to the words, they have too a plea in your feelings: for with the mo&s;t plaintive pathos, which nature can expre&s;s, &s;orrow &s;its &s;peaking from countenance to countenance; and her yet repeated theme is, "there is a PRINCE and a GREAT MAN fallen this day in I&s;rael."</P>
<P>HERE let us con&s;ider, what in the eye of rea&s;on and Omni&s;cience imparts lu&s;tre to the character of a Prince, and con&s;titutes the eminently great man.&mdash;We will then pau&s;e, and contemplate his exit from the world, with its circum&s;tances, and effects.&mdash;And your hearts will expect, what my feelings will dictate, the obvious conclu&s;ion; which the occa&s;ion requires.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, a broad ba&s;is of civil greatne&s;s is laid by him, who becomes <HI>the noble and virtuous</HI> founder of an empire. To give exi&s;tence to an independent people, and e&s;tabli&s;h their national being among the kingdoms of the earth, is the &s;ublime work only of uncommon talents. It fills us with lofty conceptions of the character, by whom it is effected; and obtains the admiration of remote&s;t po&s;|terity. In all ages, nations with a&s;&s;iduous pride have embalmed the memories of their founders. Time, the demoli&s;her of every glorious fabric, has generally re&s;pect|ed their names. Ba&s;e mea&s;ures, and &s;elfi&s;h con&s;iderations, have &s;ometimes di&s;graced this va&s;t achievement of man;
<PB N="9" REF="037308_0006_100CB02AA55C9B10">
and left us to admire the greatne&s;s of the work, without one &s;entiment of regard for the agent. ROME's founder was ignoble.&mdash;The MEDES owed their empire to a mon&s;ter.&mdash;But, the man, who, animated by the generous thought of extending the dominion of liberty, and giving a <HI>distinct</HI> field to the exertions of his countrymen, effects the inde|pendence and e&s;tabli&s;hment of a nation, who, without other motive, than a de&s;ire to render his people great and happy, founds their empire <HI>in right,</HI> and would have it grow by <HI>the vigour of freedom, law, and virtue,</HI> who, regardle&s;s of per&s;onal emolument, &s;eeks only to be loved by them as their <HI>affectionate civil father,</HI> &s;uch a man mu&s;t be con&s;i|dered, as rai&s;ed up by Heaven in a favoured land, to con|duct one of tho&s;e grand operations, which involve almo&s;t an infinitude of intere&s;ts; together with the fate, and cha|racter, of millions of the human race.</P>
<P>To lay this unperi&s;hable ba&s;is of renown is indeed a rare glory. It has belonged only to a <HI>few</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hed beings, who have been endowed for the work with un|common powers and re&s;ources. Many have been protect|ing <HI>rulers</HI> of a people; and rai&s;ed them to eminent great|ne&s;s and refinement. But, few <HI>virtuous founders</HI> of em|pires have ennobled the annals of the world.</P>
<P>IN the ruler, however, there are definite characteri&s;|tics of true greatne&s;s and glory. <HI>Wisdom, firmness,</HI> and <HI>integrity,</HI> are the e&s;&s;entials of excellence in a Chief. An active, ob&s;erving mind, enriched with a knowledge of hu|man nature, and of the experiments of pa&s;t ages in govern|ing men&mdash;a prudence, in&s;piring calm &s;urveys of the natures, pro&s;pects, dangers, and re&s;ources, of his people&mdash;an uni|form

form collectedne&s;s, guarding him again&s;t &s;urprize and de|&s;pondence in urgent moments, enabling him to a&s;&s;ert and di&s;charge his duty, and rendering him unmoveable by the calumnies, to which the con&s;picuous mu&s;t ever be expo&s;ed,&mdash;above all, an integrity, which &s;corns di&s;gui&s;e, which impenetrable and lu&s;trous, like poli&s;hed &s;teel, holds not a moment the breath of flattery nor abu&s;e, which, unaffected by &s;ini&s;ter con&s;iderations, is anxious only to be faithful to its tru&s;t&mdash;the&s;e are properties, which form the chief, who&s;e glory is pure, and who&s;e greatne&s;s is real. In his &s;tation as rule<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, he &s;tands like a venerable column, rai&s;ed by his people's hearts, concentrating in him&s;elf, and exhibiting to the world, his country's triumphs, dignity, and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>THE &s;eat of power is not, however, the only place, where we are to look for the traits, which form the glory of a prince, and con&s;titute the truly great man. In every act of his life, we may &s;ee love for his country influencing his conduct; and eminent per&s;onal magnanimity. It is not power, that he covets. It is not for the &s;ake of ruling, that he holds the civil reins. In whatever &s;tation he can mo&s;t &s;erve his country, whether as the leader of her ho&s;ts, as the guide of her councils, or, as a fixed luminary, in private life &s;hedding the affecting lu&s;tre of una&s;piring virtue, that &s;tation is his choice.&mdash;Is he in the field? The love of con|que&s;t does not inflame his brea&s;t. His procedure is not governed by an in&s;atiate zeal for triumph. He is, indeed, courageous; and aims by &s;kill and kindne&s;s to call forth all the prowe&s;s of his troops. But his only object is <HI>to defend his country's rights.</HI> So &s;oon as her honor permits, his lan|guage is that of the chief, whom the text bewails; "<HI>Shall the sword devour forever? Knowest thou not, that it will be
<PB N="11" REF="037308_0008_100CB02CC5C66C90">
bitterness in the latter end?</HI>"<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">II <HI>Samuel,</HI> ii, 26.</NOTE> Is he in the cabinet? No thir&s;t for fame, no &s;elfi&s;h ambition, no ignoble hopes, in&s;tigate his coun&s;els. His country's character is his own. Her pro&s;perity is his aggrandizement. His &s;teady aim is to conduct her to greatne&s;s and felicity, by arts, frugality, order, and virtue, under the ble&s;t influences of peace. If he be rai&s;ed to &s;overeign authority, no pomp of honors, nor pride of pre-eminence, can deba&s;e his patriot mind.&mdash;When he has e&s;tabli&s;hed the empire of his wi&s;hes, &s;een it in good organization, and can &s;afely re&s;ign the &s;uperintend|ence of it to another, he appears mo&s;t truly great, if <HI>a rare magnanimity</HI> prompt him to di&s;play the noble&s;t act of public virtue, by relinqui&s;hing &s;tation, and power, and their flat|tering concomitants <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> retire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> and exhibit, as a citizen, an obedience to the laws, which as a ruler, he enforced.</P>
<P>BUT public achievements and public honors will not fini&s;h the character of a prince and great man. There are private virtues, which, though of &s;maller lu&s;tre, are of divine nature. Without the&s;e no greatne&s;s is complete. Here is the defect of many of the he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">es of antiquity. Here is the imperfection, which we mu&s;t over regret, in many renowned characters.&mdash;They di&s;play grandeur of exploit, great prowe&s;s in arms, deep &s;kill in legi&s;lation: but their noble virtues are alone. They want attendants. We &s;ee none of the humble, humane, dome&s;tic virtues; without which all glory is deficient. They po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;trength of mind: but we have to deplore its rudene&s;s. We find in them collectedne&s;s; but we look in vain for humanity by its &s;ide. They &s;hew us integrity; but we are obliged to mark the want of courteous ea&s;e, to render it agreeable.&mdash;
<PB N="12" REF="037308_0009_100CAFFD0DEDAC80">
Intent only upon being public heroes, &s;ome of them, alas! have been private brutes. Without <HI>the amiable qualities of the heart,</HI> popular deeds purcha&s;e but a tin&s;el renown. He, who is great in worth, as well as name, endeavours to blend with the glories of a Chief, the virtues of a man. One aim regulates his life&mdash;to exalt human nature, while he &s;erves his country. He is, therefore, &s;tudious of every excellence; and his private virtues &s;often the brightne&s;s of his public accompli&s;hments into the mo&s;t endearing loveline&s;s.</P>
<P>To crown the glorious properties of the truly great character, RELIGION reigns in his bo&s;om. A prince, or ruler, without religion, wants the be&s;t glory of humanity. He is de&s;titute of that, which, <HI>as a principle,</HI> gives worth to every action; and, <HI>as an excellence,</HI> reflects a nobler lu&s;tre upon the mo&s;t fini&s;hed human greatne&s;s. The vir|tuous prince, and real patriot, perceives in the &s;entiment, which leads him to GOD for guidance, the mo&s;t u&s;eful truth he can exemplify to his country. For them, it is nece&s;&s;ary to improvement and to happine&s;s. In him, it dignifies, every applauded quality. Venerable, as of etherial nature, is the glory, with which <HI>the religious principle</HI> inve&s;ts civil greatne&s;s; and now, that the Eternal FATHER "hath &s;poken to us by his SON," the CHRISTIAN GRACES, more than the themes of ancient fame, ennoble the Chief; and perfect the man.</P>
<P>WE have now &s;een the properties, which form a cha|racter, princely indeed; and eminently great. Let us pau&s;e&mdash;and contemplate the exit of &s;uch a man from the world, with its circum&s;tances, and effects.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="037308_0010_100CB02E4C21CA08">
IN it&s;elf, it is peaceful and glorious. Sweet is the review, which he takes of life. Soothing are the pro&s;pects, which he &s;ees in death. But for his country's good, he would not wi&s;h to defer the hour of departure. He expects in it an <HI>honourable</HI> re&s;t from his anxious cares for his coun|try's &s;afety and improvement. It promi&s;es him a freedom from that mon&s;trous ingratitude, which (O &s;hame to our nature!) not cele&s;tial perfection could e&s;cape. He knows, he &s;hall leave a &s;potle&s;s &s;ame, which po&s;terity will venerate. And A CROWN IS BEFORE HIM, IN A REALM OF ETER|NAL PEACE. Re&s;igned to the will of his GOD, he waits his me&s;&s;enger. Death cannot deprive him of his lu&s;tre. The Sun, which &s;hone bright through the day, &s;ets in mild &s;plendor at eve; and, &s;ave THE BEAMS <HI>which pensive reflection holds,</HI> carries its greatne&s;s and its glories with it.</P>
<P>BUT, though the departure of &s;uch a character from the world is, in it&s;elf, peaceful and glorious, deep &s;hades of gloom pervade the regio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, he leaves; and mournful darkne&s;s, fixed upon every object, he illumined, &s;peaks bereavement.</P>
<P>IN the relatives and friends, whom he loved, and in the &s;ocieties, with which he was a&s;&s;ociated, the death of the truly great man touches every tender nerve of &s;orrow.&mdash;The ties, with which nature, or appropriate affection, unites individuals with &s;uch a character, mu&s;t be inexpre&s;&s;i|bly &s;trong and dear. The pride and plea&s;ure, which we feel, in being any way related to &s;uch greatne&s;s, renders him the glory and delight of each fraternity, that enrols him among its fellows. Every object connected with him, the near per&s;ons of his hou&s;hold, the partners of his con|fidence,
<PB N="14" REF="037308_0011_100CAFFE97FEE9F0">
and companions of his life, the &s;ocieties, civil and religious, to which he belongs, all &s;hine, <HI>distinguished,</HI> in the lu&s;tre of his name. What a lo&s;s then do they &s;u&s;tain, when he expires! How involuntarily do their faces gather angui&s;h! They heave the &s;igh of regret&mdash;They &s;eek the &s;ympathy of grief&mdash;They wear the in&s;ignia of &s;orrow&mdash;But&mdash;alas! The heart of the relative is rent! The boa&s;t of the &s;ocieties is gone!</P>
<P>TO A NATION the death of &s;uch a Prince and great man is one of the mo&s;t &s;olemn bereavements, it can &s;u&s;tain. In his country &s;uch a man is a centre of union, a &s;ource of light, and a re&s;ervoir of &s;trength. In his country &s;uch a man is more trea&s;ure, than all its revenues: more glory than all its achievements. In his country &s;uch a man is heaven's gift&mdash;the be&s;t of national di&s;tinctions&mdash;a kind of guardian angel. His name is a ho&s;t. His renown is at once the en|vy, and the dread, of every foe. His inhabitance is dignity and defence. So long, as &s;he retains him, his country FEELS HERSELF GREAT. How awful, then, the event, which ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s him from her. It is like the withdrawal of light, when a cloud pa&s;&s;es over the earth, who&s;e portentous gloom fills every one with di&s;may. His exit is felt by his country in every member; and mournful are her a&s;pect, and thoughts. A &s;olemn knell moans through the bereav|ed land. Gaiety &s;tops, to mu&s;e on the &s;ad tidings. In|du&s;try pau&s;es, to wipe away a tear. The wi&s;e, with anxious &s;orrow, pre&s;age the con&s;equences. And the matron, with pious patrioti&s;m, tells her little ones, <HI>who is dead.</HI> The &s;or|rowing fathers of the land a&s;&s;emble. Upon one object they are all intent&mdash;how they may be&s;t honor the departed hero. While thus they &s;eek to &s;ooth the public grief, even calum|ny
<PB N="15" REF="037308_0012_100CB02FD2C0A8C0">
cea&s;es from her rudene&s;s; hu&s;ht by the &s;olemnity of ge|neral mourning. Religion, &s;ympathi&s;ing, &s;anctifies the af|fliction. The nation pays its funeral tributes to the worthy. And long, long, is his country mindful of her lo&s;s. Long, very long, is &s;he &s;ad, that her "prince and her great man <HI>is fallen.</HI>"</P>
<P>FINALLY, when &s;uch a character dies, THE WORLD is affected&mdash;the whole family of man mourns. Such great and good men ennoble human nature. In all countries their names are honoured; and their virtues revered. Man, wherever he is, will admire &s;uch con&s;picuous and uncom|mon worth. He &s;ees a dignity, imparted by it to his &s;pecies, which produces in his bo&s;om a glow of noble emotions.&mdash;Congenial greatne&s;s di&s;covers in it a maje&s;ty, <HI>be&s;towed on</HI> eminent &s;tations; not <HI>borrowed from</HI> them; and is excited to an imitation of its peculiar excellencies. The blow, therefore, which takes the virtuous chief and truly great man from earth, is felt by the world. The regret, it occa&s;ions, is not confined to place; but is as exten&s;ive, as human in|tere&s;ts, and the bo&s;oms of men. Man re&s;pects greatne&s;s: and his &s;elf-love, as well as philanthrophy, cau&s;es him to mourn, when the luminaries of his race expire.</P>
<P>SUCH are the properties, which &s;hed glory on a prince&punc; and form the truly great man. And &s;uch his exit from this terre&s;tial &s;cene, its circum&s;tances, and its effects.</P>
<P>HAVE not your hearts, my friends, di&s;cerned at every &s;tep the lineaments of <HI>WASHINGTON?</HI>&mdash;Have you not anticipated the remark, that <HI>all the solid glory</HI> of a prince, and <HI>every property</HI> of the truly great man, exi&s;ted in that

But it was vain. His virtues were too dear to you not to have been in&s;tantly recognized. Your li&s;tening griefs quick felt, and told, that in the qualities and exit of eminent greatne&s;s I de&s;cribed your departed hero. Yes&mdash;what was &s;aid, was in all parts applicable to him&mdash;I &s;ee him in the field, in the council, in the temple, in his dignified retirement, and at death, di&s;playing every virtue, which can adorn the &s;oldier, the &s;tate&s;man, the citizen, and the chri&s;tian. But, while we triumph in the thought, that it was re&s;erved for our country, at this late age of the world, to produce THE MAN, who &s;hould exhibit in his character AN ASSEMBLAGE OF ALL HUMAN EXCELLENCIES, the blood retreats cold to the heart, and the &s;pirits faulter, at the recollection, that now&mdash;<HI>he is no more!</HI> No more &s;hall our country con&s;ole her&s;elf under every pro&s;pect, that &s;he has in one man enough to render her more eminent, than the nations of the earth&mdash;No more "&s;hall his name prove a rampart, and the know|ledge that he exi&s;ts a bulwark, again&s;t the &s;ecret and open enemies of his country's peace."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>PRESIDENT ADAMS's speech at his first inauguration to the pre|sidency of the United States.</HI></NOTE>&mdash;No more &s;hall all earthly powers fear and re&s;pect our land, becau&s;e HE dwells here; and court our alliance to be related to him&mdash;No more &s;hall the old and the young feel a pride in being his cotempora|ries; and point to beams, retained by THE PATRIOT MOUNT,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mount Vernon in Virginia,</HI>&mdash;<HI>the residence of Washington.</HI></NOTE> when the glory of their country is low&mdash;He is gone from our admiration!

If the &s;ouls of the departed have cognizance of things below the &s;kies, the glorified Chief &s;hall enjoy a reward of his labor for his country's welfare, in beholding his work and virtues continued, to her prai&s;e, by the imitating gratitude of far di&s;tant de&s;cendants.

<HEAD>A PRAYER WHICH PRECEDED THE DISCOURSE.</HEAD>
<P>ALMIGHTY and immortal God, who&s;e days are without end, and who&s;e judgments are irre|proachable, look down from heaven, we humbly be&s;eech thee, upon a mourning land, and behold the &s;orrows of the people, whom thou ha&s;t afflicted. In thy wi&s;dom thou ha&s;t &s;een fit to take from our Country the man, whom thou did&s;t give for her glory and defence. The excellent of her coun&s;ellors is fallen; and the valiant of her ho&s;ts is no more. Verily for this our hearts are pained; and our an|gui&s;h, O God, is exceedingly great. What &s;hall we &s;ay? Where &s;hall we go? How &s;hall we humble our&s;elves under thy heavy hand? Thou art teaching us, that <HI>we may not put our trust in princes, nor in the best of the sons of men, for their breath goeth forth of their nostrils, and then all their thoughts perish.</HI> Thou art teaching us, that the good and the great, <HI>though they be called gods, must die like men;</HI> and making us feel, how fallacious are the hopes of man. We do to day call to our remembrance a chief, dear to his country as her be&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, a noble, di&s;tingui&s;hed above the rulers of the earth, now laid in the du&s;t by thy awful providence, and vani&s;hed like a bli&s;sful vi&s;ion of the night. While we bend and weep under thy irrever&s;ible decree, &s;uffer us to deprecate the con&s;equences, which anticipation fears from this event. <HI>When it is told in Gath, let not the Philistines rejoice. When it is published in the streets of As|kelon, let not the children of the uncircumcised triumph.</HI>&mdash;In our councils let thy Spirit be in&s;tead of him, whom thou

ha&s;t taken away. And, when thou bringe&s;t the terror of battle upon our land, <HI>wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts?</HI> We &s;ubmit to thy will; commending our country unto thee, and all her Intere&s;ts. Thou knowe&s;t, Lord, the &s;ecrets of our hearts, &s;hut not thy merciful ears to our pray|ers. <HI>Shew her servants thy work, and their children thy glo|ry: and the glorious majesty of the Lord our God be upon</HI> her: <HI>prosper thou the work of</HI> their <HI>hands upon</HI> her; <HI>O prosper thou</HI> their <HI>handy work.</HI> And now, O God, we be&s;eech thee to look down upon us, thy unworthy &s;ervants, and a&s;&s;i&s;t us in the work and &s;ervice, in which we are engaged. Grant, that in our homage to our departed hero, no improper &s;or|rows may di&s;grace us as chri&s;tians; but in all our works, begun, continued, and ended, in thee, may we glorify thy holy name; and finally, by thy mercy obtain everla&s;ting life, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, our Lord, who taught and com|mended us, when we pray to &s;ay,</P>
<P><HI>Our Father, who art in heaven,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
