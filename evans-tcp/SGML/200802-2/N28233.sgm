<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>2d of Samuel, 3d Chap. and part of the 38th Ver&s;e.</BIBL>
<Q>"KNOW YE NOT THAT THERE IS A GREAT MAN FALLEN?"</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the&s;e words David refers to Abner, a di&s;tingui&s;hed officer of his day, who fell an un&s;u&s;pecting victim to the well known traitorous &s;cheme, and by the bloody hand of Joab, who&s;e brother A&s;ahel, to &s;ave his own life, Abner had reluctantly &s;lain in a battle at Gibeon. To awaken a corre&s;pondent &s;en&s;e of their great lo&s;s in the afflicted Tribes, David addre&s;&s;ed to them the pathetic inquiry adopted on this melancholy occa&s;ion, as applying with the mo&s;t forcible propriety to the late Lieutenant General GEORGE WASHINGTON. Know ye not that in him a great man, a much greater than Abner, is fallen? The &s;uffi|ciently vi&s;ible effects of this penetrating conviction, render a compari&s;on of the&s;e great men unnece&s;&s;ary, would the dignity of my &s;ubject, and the &s;olemnity which reigns over this unexampled and overflowing concour&s;e admit it. Their coinci|dence in point of greatne&s;s, e&s;tabli&s;hed by the highe&s;t authorities, whatever di&s;|parity as to the degrees of it, may exi&s;t, is all that is requi&s;ite to my purpo&s;e. In reliance therefore, on the plenitude of candor to which I am already greatly in arrears, however inadequate to the important &s;ervice which has unexpectedly devolved on me, and with all the unaffected diffidence which overwhelms me, I &s;hall make immediate advances towards the awful ground on which our greate&s;t orators link unnerved, and giants in literature &s;tand and tremble! And though I am not about to deliver an oration, nor to pronounce an eulogium; but to preach a &s;ermon, and briefly <HI>touch</HI> on one of the greate&s;t <HI>merely</HI> human characters, I am fully appri&s;ed of the delicacy of my &s;ituation, and too &s;en&s;ibly feel the pre&s;|&s;ure of difficulties.</P>
<P>My feeble &s;oul take courage! a <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> or a <HI>Cicero</HI> might fail here without di&s;honor; and though the famed Cae&s;ars, Alexanders, Pompies and Marlboroughs, mu&s;t re&s;ign their inferior laurels to the more famous <HI>American General,</HI> he was but a man; all his greatne&s;s was derived from his and thy CREA|TOR, and thou wilt be a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the execution of thy arduous de&s;ign by the prayers, candid allowances and liberal con&s;tructions of thine audience, who will deem it very pardonable on thy theme to be defective. The fir&s;t doctrinal ob&s;ervation which our text, and the occa&s;ion of our a&s;&s;embling, unitedly &s;ugge&s;t, is &s;eriou&s;ly important: Great as ABNER was, he fell; and WASHINGTON is fallen; it, therefore, undeniably follows <HI>that great men, as well as others, mu&s;t fall.</HI> Though it would be ab&s;urd to attempt a formal proof of this doctrine,
<PB N="5" REF="037634_0005_100EF04972856150">
and have the appearance of an in&s;ult on dying man, there is nothing that me|rits more frequent, or more &s;erious con&s;ideration; and a few explanatory remarks on it are &s;o far from being ami&s;s, that they are indi&s;pen&s;ible. The Heathens and Dei&s;ts, of all de&s;criptions, believing the immortality of the human &s;oul, con&s;ider their bodies as falling by death into corruption and du&s;t, never to ri&s;e; and their notions of the &s;tate, exerci&s;es, and enjoyments of the &s;oul after death are &s;o vague, indi&s;tinct, and unimpre&s;&s;ive, that they have little or no vi&s;ible effect on their practice. Athei&s;ts, and &s;uch Dei&s;ts as believe the &s;oul of man to be mortal, con&s;ider all who are fallen, and our immortal WASHINGTON among the re&s;t, as plunged into undi&s;tingui&s;hed and irretrievable ruin! as con&s;igned to their original nonentity!! Happily for our various intere&s;ts, few, if any, of the&s;e gloomy mon&s;ters di&s;grace, or infe&s;t the United States: They are chiefly, if not altogether, confined to the &s;moke and flame in which they have involved mi&s;erable Europe. Let Americans never &s;uffer their nature and its <HI>author</HI> to be in&s;ulted and degraded by the influence, or exi&s;tence of &s;uch dete&s;table &s;en|timents;
<Q>Scorned be the man who thinks him&s;elf a brute;</Q>
<Q><HI>Affronts</HI> his <HI>&s;pecies,</HI> and his GOD <HI>bla&s;phemes.</HI></Q></P>
<P>But gladly I turn your attention from the cold, lifele&s;s principles, and pain|ful uncertainty of the better &s;ort of Heathens and the Dei&s;ts, and e&s;pecially from the in&s;upportable horrors of <HI>annihilation,</HI> to what we are to under&s;tand by the <HI>fall</HI> of men in death; and, in a word, it is their fall from this world; from its honors, plea&s;ures, profits; and from the exerci&s;e of their mortal powers. By a figure of &s;peech, which puts a part for the whole, or the contrary, and common with in&s;pired, and other writers, in &s;aying that a great man in fallen, David means no more than that his mortal part is dead; but he was better informed than to &s;uppo&s;e that even <HI>this</HI> was dead or fallen, to revive, to ri&s;e no more. We not only know from divine revelation, but from an important and well atte&s;ted fact, gloriou&s;ly demon&s;trated at this time by its numerous and happy con&s;equences, that our bodies are not only capable of a re&s;urrection, but &s;hall actually ri&s;e! Were the horrible rever&s;e of the&s;e exhilirating repre&s;entations true, incon&s;iderable <HI>indeed</HI> would be our cau&s;e of triumph in exi&s;tence, or rea&s;on to boa&s;t of human excellence! <HI>"Verily every man, at his be&s;t &s;tate,"</HI> con&s;idered merely in his relation to this tran&s;itory &s;cene, <HI>"is altogether vanity."</HI> And the inevitable fall of the greate&s;t, as well as all other men, when viewed in a <HI>true</HI> light, and con&s;idered in its eternal con&s;equences, mu&s;t &s;ill the enlightened con&s;iderate mind with the mo&s;t &s;erious reflections. It is &s;aid,
<Q><L><HI>Xerxis &s;urveyed his mighty ho&s;t with tears,</HI></L>
<L><HI>To think they'd die within an hundred years:</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>But judging from pa&s;t events, what enormous deva&s;tations among the inha|bitants of the earth mu&s;t be &s;pread in le&s;s than half that time! "Your Fathers,
<PB N="6" REF="037634_0006_100EF04B398528A0">
where are they? and the prophets, do they live forever?" Where are all prece|ding generations, and the great men who illuminated and adorned them? Alas! the mighty ruins of mortality! With a few illu&s;trious exemptions, recorded in the oracles of God, the &s;ilent, and almo&s;t imperceptibly &s;low, but &s;teady and irre&s;i&s;tibly &s;trong current of time, has borne them into the boundle&s;s ocean of eternity! And yet Philip of Macedon was far from being alone, in needing daily to be told that he was a mortal man.</P>
<P>That all men mu&s;t fall, is univer&s;ally acknowledged; but too few apply this &s;erious truth to their own ca&s;es; Doctor Young had rea&s;ons for his bold a&s;&s;ertion,</P>
<P>"All men think all men mortal but them&s;elves." And great men, from a variety of circum&s;tances, are more than others, addicted to this waking dream, this &s;ometimes fatal delu&s;ion; and &s;trange as fatal! <HI>"Know ye not that there is a great man fallen?"</HI> and that con&s;equently <HI>great men mu&s;t fall!</HI> Riches, power, titles, univer&s;al applau&s;e, to which may be added even virtue and piety, avail nothing in this warfare, "Death enters, and there's no defence." Ac|knowledge this all do, they mu&s;t, however incon&s;iderate and profane, for who can deny it? <HI>But O, that they were wi&s;e, that they under&s;tood this, that they would con&s;ider their latter end!"</HI> How natural, rea&s;onable, and intere&s;ting is this? and one would think it might be added, how difficult to avoid it!</P>
<LG>
<L><HI>" As man perhaps the moment of his breath,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Receives the lurking principle of death;</HI></L>
<L><HI>The young di&s;ea&s;e that mu&s;t &s;ubdue at length,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Grows with his growth, and &s;trengthens with his &s;trength."</HI></L>
</LG>
<P>And when the&s;e latent &s;eeds of di&s;&s;olution produce their ultimate effect, our text directs us in what regards our duty to the memories of the ju&s;t. By fair and obvious implication, it &s;ays, <HI>the fall of a great man merits re&s;pectful and public attention.</HI>
<Q><L><HI>"Know ye not that there is a great man fallen?"</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>This que&s;tion was not a&s;ked for information, and it not only forcibly affirms the fall of a great man: but evidently excites to mourning on account of it, and proper expre&s;&s;ions of re&s;pect for his memory. <HI>Know ye not,</HI> that is, are ye not appri&s;ed, or di&s;po&s;ed to con&s;ider, as ye &s;hould be, and to practically declare, <HI>that</HI> in your judgment, <HI>there is a great man,</HI> a man of worth, and entitled to high and public regard, <HI>fallen?</HI></P>
<P>And accordingly we find that David &s;aid to the people to whom he addre&s;&s;ed the words of our text, "Rent your clothes, and gird you with &s;ackcloth, and mourn before Abner." The &s;acred hi&s;torian adds, "And king David him|&s;elf followed the bier. And they buried Abner in Hebron: And the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept."</P>
<P>The &s;olemnity concludes with an oration by the king, which produced the
<PB N="7" REF="037634_0007_100EF04D62EF0228">
highe&s;t effects of oratory, and clo&s;es with an acknowledgment, that he was rendered weak though anointed king, by the lo&s;s of that great man. Parellel pa&s;&s;ages, in great variety, might be recited in confirmation of this doctrine. In&s;tances are numerous in the patriarchal age, of burying per&s;ons of eminent piety and worth, with every mark of re&s;pect and &s;olemnity.</P>
<P>The venerable founders of the Jewi&s;h church and nation, had the tribute of high encomiums, and genuine mourning for many days, paid to their memories and their merits. A beautiful &s;pecimen of ancient eulogy, is David's lamen|tation over Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> and Jonathan. With an ardor and elevation peculiar to him|&s;elf, he exclaims, "The beauty of I&s;rael is &s;lain in thy high places; how are the mighty fallen! Tell it not in Gath, publi&s;h it not in the &s;treets of A&s;kelon, le&s;t the daughters of the Phili&s;tines rejoice, le&s;t the daughters of the uncircumci&s;ed triumph. Ye mountains of Gilboa let there be no dew, neither let there be rain upon you, nor fields of offerings; for there the &s;hield of the mighty is vile|ly ca&s;t away, the &s;hield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil. From the blood of the &s;lain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the &s;word of Saul returned not empty. Saul and Jona|than were lovely and plea&s;ant in their lives, and in their deaths they were not divided. They were &s;wifter than Eagles, they were &s;tronger than Lions. Ye daughters of I&s;rael weep over Saul, who clothed you in &s;carlet, with other de|lights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel. How are the mighty fallen in the mid&s;t of the battle!"</P>
<P>This natural and laudable, as well as ancient and univer&s;al cu&s;tom of honoring the pious and eminent dead, may be further ju&s;tified by quotations from the new te&s;tament. At the grave of Lazarous, "JESUS wept;" devout men buried Stephen, who had the honor to be the fir&s;t martyr in the chri&s;tian cau&s;e, with great lamention; and Paul mentions a number of the illu&s;trious characters of antiquity, with the highe&s;t re&s;pect, and warmly recommends their noble and heroic conduct to the imitation of po&s;terity. After be&s;towing on many the encomiums proper to their re&s;pective merits, he adds, "And what &s;hall I more &s;ay? for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon, and of Barack, and of Samp&s;on, and of Jepthae, of David al&s;o, and of Samuel, and of the prophets; who through faith &s;ubdued kingdoms, wrought righteou&s;ne&s;s, obtained promi&s;es, &s;topped the mouths of Lions, quenched the violence of fire, e&s;caped the edge of the &s;word, out of weakne&s;s were made &s;trong, waxed valient in fight, and turned to flight the armies of the Aliens." So warm a panegyri&s;t of the&s;e great men was the Apo&s;tle, that he avers, <HI>"Of them the world was not worthy."</HI> And though many of the&s;e failed of obtaining the attention due to their merits in, and immediately after their re&s;pective generations, by having their names and worthy deeds enrolled in the volume of in&s;piration, GOD has plainly &s;hewn us
<PB N="8" REF="037634_0008_100EF0500D2F32C8">
that the fall a of great good man &s;hould excite re&s;pectful and public attention. Encouraged, therefore, and in &s;ome degree a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;uch precedents, I will proceed to what is <HI>finally</HI> incumbent on me; and that is, <HI>to evince the applica|bility of any text to the illu&s;trious decea&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>It mu&s;t be acknowledged that the &s;criptural and con&s;equently rational and becoming cu&s;tom of prai&s;ing departed per&s;ons, has been &s;hamefully abu&s;ed. The great among the Heathens have, in many in&s;tances, been exalted to cele&s;tial honors, and idolized to di&s;tant generations. And by per&s;ons of better infor|mation, funeral panegyric has been &s;o indi&s;criminately be&s;towed, that it has blended all di&s;tinctions of character and become proverbially fal&s;e. But it is not on the&s;e or any other accounts, to be refu&s;ed on proper occa&s;ions, this would be falling into the oppo&s;ite extreme. And perhaps a more proper occa&s;ion than the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> for commendation and applau&s;e never occurred, or one on which higher might be be&s;towed, con&s;i&s;tently with truth and moderation. Never I believe could it be &s;aid of any with more propriety than of General WASHING|TON, that what his acquaintances would condemn as below his merit, &s;trangers would con&s;ider as the mo&s;t ful&s;ome adulation, or exaggerated applau&s;e. But to proceed: Mo&s;t obviou&s;ly does my text apply to this great man, con&s;idered as enriched with <HI>merely natural endowments.</HI> His features, actions, and whole deportment, before he was refined by learning, clothed with power, or known to fame, attracted every eye, fixed attention, and commanded re&s;pect, As the immediate effect of divine bounty he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;eeds who&s;e blo&s;&s;oms and fruits ultimately rendered him the boa&s;t of his country, and the glory of the age. The rich furniture of his mind could receive no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the common rules of art, becau&s;e by innate &s;trength it ro&s;e nobly &s;uperior to them, <HI>compre|hending</HI> the true principles, and proper &s;tandard of critici&s;m.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">True critici&s;m is the application of ta&s;te and of good &s;en&s;e to the &s;everal fine arts. Blair.</NOTE> His perceptions were prompt, intuitive, clear; and were di&s;played from earlie&s;t youth in the facility and rapidity with which he acquired knowledge, and in the exact order, method and propriety con&s;picuous in the management of all his affairs. And to the fatal day which put a period to the mo&s;t valuable of mortal lives, his conduct and achievements, proclaimed his genius entirely original, &s;uperlatively bright, the offspring of the FATHER OF LIGHTS. In his va&s;t mind centered that &s;hining aggregate of excellencies which beamed with &s;uch effulgence in his dignified and manly countenance, and were &s;o eminently ornamental, I will not &s;ay of his country, nor of this generation, but of human nature. When we con&s;ider that all effects mu&s;t have, an adequate cau&s;e, we are led to trace the wonders which have appeared in WASHINGTON'S life, to, at lea&s;t, an equally wonderful &s;ource: This we find in a &s;oul calm and &s;erene as the mo&s;t delightful &s;ummer-evening, more expan&s;ive than the ocean, more re&s;plendent than yonder &s;un, and &s;teady as the
<PB N="9" REF="037634_0009_100EF0524A9D3578">
poles! The&s;e intellectual, and con&s;equently immortal trea&s;ures rendered him uncommonly great as the child of nature; and our text applies to him very forcibly as enlarged and enobled by mental <HI>acqui&s;itions,</HI></P>
<P>Divine Providence gave him opportunities and di&s;po&s;itions to add great <HI>ac|quired,</HI> to the greate&s;t <HI>natural</HI> abilities. If his education were not cla&s;&s;ical, it was profound: If he had not the comparatively &s;uperficial knowledge of all <HI>names,</HI> he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an univer&s;al knowledge of <HI>things:</HI> And tho' no great pro|portion of his precious time was &s;pent in the &s;tudy of dead languages, it was becau&s;e the beautious objects of all kinds of u&s;eful and ornamental knowledge invited his attention and per&s;uit, in all the copious elegance of Engli&s;h attire.</P>
<P>His great mind was occupied with corre&s;pondent objects. He had well arranged and di&s;tinct ideas of all a&s;&s;entially intere&s;ting, and truly important facts, dome&s;tic and foreign, antient and modern, temporal and &s;piritual. Among the &s;ubjects which WASHINGTON inve&s;tigated, and the objects which he regar|ded with an a&s;&s;iduity and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s becoming their importance, were &s;cience, morality and religion; civil and religious liberty; agriculture commerce and navigation; tactics, and the different forms of civil government; the ri&s;e revolutions, and falls of empires, in connection with their cau&s;es and con&s;e|qnences; and the religions, laws, cu&s;toms, characters and origin of nations.</P>
<P>With a &s;ingular felicity of perception, he comprehended the &s;ubjects of his knowledge in all their exten&s;ions and relations; and we well know, that in his conver&s;ation, public &s;peeches, and admirable writings, ea&s;e and &s;trength were united with all the beauty and &s;implicity of preci&s;ion. But as it would require talents brilliant as his own to do ju&s;tice to a &s;ubject of &s;uch extent and &s;ubli|mity, I &s;hall conclude the&s;e imperfect remarks on his great literary merit, by ob&s;erving that the honor of conferring on him the degree of L. L.

variety and profu&s;ion, if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf of Heaven's bounties, we are led to conclude that &s;uch mental &s;trength and excellence as WASHINGTON po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, mu&s;t have been properly depo&s;ited, furni&s;hed with &s;uitable organs, and intended for appropriate and important purpo&s;es: And our expectations are ful|ly an&s;wered when we view him as entitled to the application of our text, <HI>by the di&s;po&s;als of an all &s;uperintending Providence.</HI></P>
<P>Born and rai&s;ed under a free government, he early imbibed, and always che|ri&s;hed, and retained the &s;acred principles of liberty, his <HI>birth right,</HI> inviolable. Though of re&s;pectable de&s;cent, ance&s;try need not be mentioned, where per&s;onal and intrin&s;ic worth is &s;o eminent and con&s;picuous. Nor does he derive any of his greatne&s;s from the large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions with which his many and di&s;tingui&s;hed virtues, and &s;ervices, were to as great a degree as <HI>he would permit,</HI> but by no means <HI>adequately</HI> rewarded: he conferred honor on affluence. The complicated <HI>organ</HI> of his va&s;t and noble mind, a glorious &s;pecimen of divine ingenuity, was moderately large, elegantly proportioned, and amply endowed with agility and &s;trength, gracefulne&s;s and dignity. In early youth his &s;uperior parts and abili|ties attracted public attention; and by traver&s;ing a trackle&s;s de&s;ert, obtaining the intelligence &s;o intere&s;ting to his beloved country, and &s;aving <HI>Bradock's</HI> army on the Monongahela, from the jaws of a cruel death by mercile&s;s &s;avages, he pro|ved him&s;elf capable of the mo&s;t difficult, arduous and perilous &s;ervices. The &s;agacity and prowe&s;s, promptitude and deci&s;ion, which he di&s;played, about this time, on &s;everal trying occa&s;ions, were &s;trongly indicative of his future elevation. And from the univer&s;al rectitude of his conduct in private and public, civil and religious life, as well as from the proofs he had furni&s;hed of his great military capacity, <HI>Pre&s;ident Davis,</HI> long before there exi&s;ted a thought of the late revo|lutionary war, &s;aid from the <HI>Pulpit,</HI> "I may point out to the public that heroic youth, <HI>Col. Wa&s;hington,</HI> whom I cannot but hope, providence has hitherto pre&s;erved for &s;ome important &s;ervice to his country." And this has &s;ince a&s;&s;umed the ap|pearance of a divine prediction: For <HI>we feel,</HI> and the <HI>world knows</HI> what an <HI>im|portant &s;ervice he has rendered his country.</HI> When the unhappy controver&s;y be|tween Great-Britain and her thirteen American Provinces, ro&s;e &s;o high, and produced &s;uch effects, that the dreadful appeal to the &s;word was no longer di&s;|pen&s;ible, WASHINGTON, who&s;e name can receive no additional lu&s;tre from epithets, was unanimo&s;ly appointed by the repre&s;entatives of the American people, to head their undi&s;ciplined troops, almo&s;t without money or arms a|gain&s;t <HI>Briti&s;h,</HI> well armed and well di&s;ciplined veterans. The bloody conflicts which en&s;ued, the prodigies of addre&s;s, valor and pre&s;erverance of the commander in chief, and the glorious re&s;ult are well known and need not now be repeated. His &s;uperiority to difficulties, to all other men embarra&s;&s;ing and in&s;uperable, unconquerable fortitude, well-timed, and well-planned attacks on a &s;uperior

foe, and &s;plendid victories, are clothed in all the elegance and pomp of lan|guage by hi&s;torians and poets of the fir&s;t eminence. Uninfluenced by ambi|tion, when he had conducted us <HI>&s;even long years,</HI> through fields of blood and carnage, to &s;overeignty, independance and peace, like another <HI>Cincinnatus,</HI> he returned to his agricultural employments, and &s;ought repo&s;e in the &s;hades of retirement. Through his influence, an army angry and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed from painful, important, and yet <HI>uncompen&s;ated</HI> &s;ervices, &s;heathed their &s;words, and followed the example of their illu&s;trious chief!</P>
<P>But his well-tried, and &s;terling merit, united to the &s;plendor of his talents, and the unbounded confidence of his fellow-citizens, &s;oon rendered it nece&s;&s;ary, from the inefficacy of our Governmental arrangements, that he &s;hould again embark on the &s;tormy &s;ea of politics. Summoned by his country, to whom he could deny <HI>nothing,</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t in forming, and adopting our pre&s;ent energetic, yet free and happy con&s;titution, he readily obeyed; and after the accompli&s;hment of the&s;e important objects, he was called by the unanimous voice, of, at lea&s;t, three millions of people to pre&s;ide over the&s;e Sovereign and Independent States. To the pre&s;idential chair he continued a noble ornament, by the united wi&s;h of his grateful country, who delighted to honor him, <HI>eight years,</HI> and di&s;charged the important duties of this high &s;tation with his u&s;ual wi&s;dom and firmne&s;s, in|tegrity and rectitude. And after retiring the &s;econd time, in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the affections and confidence of the people, to the &s;olitude which he was as ca|pable of enjoying, as of adorning public life, he was prevailed on, tho' hoary with years, and covered with glory, to accept the command of our armies, when the political hemi&s;phere wore a mo&s;t menacing and wrathful a&s;pect. Behold the greate&s;t General in the world, tho' on the borders of three &s;core and ten, in obedience to his much indebted country, ready, again, to take the field again&s;t her in&s;ulting foes!</P>
<P>And &s;o obvious was the policy of this appointment, that it was anticipated, as well as ardently wi&s;hed by every intelligent citizen. His martial and augu&s;t appearance, the &s;ound of his <HI>name</HI> and <HI>voice,</HI> the glance of his experienced eye, and the lightning of his &s;word at the head of our armies, rendered them gloriou&s;|ly enthu&s;ia&s;tic, and ab&s;olutely invincible! But great as he was by nature, a libe|ral education, and the di&s;play and perfection of his &s;uperior powers, natural and acquired, in &s;pheres of action the mo&s;t con&s;picuous, elevated and important, he was &s;till <HI>greater</HI> by the invaluable <HI>gifts of the</HI> GOD <HI>of grace.</HI> Con&s;idered as ag|grandized by <HI>the&s;e,</HI> our text applies to him with the <HI>utmo&s;t</HI> propriety and force!</P>

<P>He would have been equalled by &s;everal if he had not &s;hone in the mild ma|je&s;ty of morals and religion. This lu&s;tre, when other things are equal, gives a decided &s;uperiority. <HI>Before,</HI> and an e&s;&s;ential part <HI>of</HI> his honor was
<PB N="12" REF="037634_0012_100EF059232D14C8">
humility. He had as little of that tumid pride, which in its plenitude goes before de&s;truction, as any man on earth. He always felt his dependance as a man; and tru&s;ting in the living GOD, whom he &s;erved, his boldne&s;s and mag|nanimity, could be equalled by nothing but his mode&s;ty and humility. By the&s;e radical advantages, he di&s;played an equanimity through he mo&s;t trying extremes of fortune, which does the highe&s;t honor to the human character. He was the &s;ame whether &s;truggling to keep the fragments of a naked army together in the di&s;mal depths of winter, again&s;t a greatly &s;uperior foe, or prefi|ling under the laurel wreath over four millions of free men!</P>
<P>He was too great to be depre&s;&s;ed or elated by any thing that cea&s;es with this life.</P>

<P>WASHINGTON'S as all true wi&s;dom ever did, and always mu&s;t, began with the fear, which was the only fear he ever knew, the <HI>fear of the Lord of Ho&s;ts:</HI> And this was truly filial, for its tran&s;cendently glorious object, was equally the object of his &s;upreme affection.</P>
<P>The&s;e divine and immortal principles pre&s;erved his tongue from every &s;pecies of profanity, and not only his actions but his heart from pollution. <HI>Alexander</HI> conquered the world; but far from ruling his &s;pirit, or being in any re&s;pect his own ma&s;ter, he fell an early and loath&s;ome &s;acrifice to intemperance. Far greater than Alexander the great, was WASHINGTON: He ruled his appetites and pa&s;&s;ions in &s;cenes of the greate&s;t trial and temptation; and will remain forever a bright example, to all men, of temperance and moderation in all things, as well as a &s;triking contra&s;t to all, <HI>"The rational foul kennels of exce&s;s."</HI></P>
<P>His piety, though like his other &s;hining excellencies unau&s;tentatious, was genuine and exalted. Through the veil of all his mode&s;t re&s;erve, it was di&s;co|verable in the whole tenor of his conduct, and e&s;pecially in his admirable and ap|propriate an&s;wers to the numerous addre&s;&s;es of his almo&s;t adoring fellow-citizens, where he uniformly, and with glowing gratitude a&s;cribes all the glory of his un|parrelled &s;ucce&s;&s;es to GOD.</P>
<P>How high <HI>chri&s;tanity</HI> &s;tood in his e&s;timation, and how near its intere&s;ts lay to his heart, every one may &s;ee, who has read his excellent an&s;wers to the con|gratulatory addre&s;&s;es of various religious bodies, on his fir&s;t election to the chief magi&s;tracy of the&s;e United States. And his opinion of religion in a <HI>political</HI> view, I will do my&s;elf the honor to give you in his own words; &s;o that though alas! he is dead, he &s;till to his weeping country thus &s;peaketh: "Of all the di&s;po&s;itions and habits which lead to political pro&s;perity, religion and morality, are indi&s;pen&s;able &s;upports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of pat|rioti&s;m, who &s;hould labor to &s;ubvert the&s;e great pillars of human happine&s;s,
<PB N="13" REF="037634_0013_100EF05B579A6778">
the&s;e firme&s;t props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to re&s;pect and cheri&s;h them. A volume could not trace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it &s;imply be a&s;ked, where is the &s;ecurity for property, for reputation, for life, if the &s;en&s;e of religious obligation de&s;ert the oaths which are the in&s;truments of in|ve&s;tigation in courts of ju&s;tice? And let us with caution indulge the &s;uppo&s;ition, that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar &s;tructure, rea&s;on and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclu|&s;ion of religious principles. 'Tis &s;ub&s;tantially true, that virtue or morality is a nece&s;&s;ary &s;pring of popular government. The rule indeed extends with more or le&s;s force to every &s;pecies of free government. Who that is a &s;incere friend to it can look with indifference upon attempts to &s;hake the foundation of the fa|brick! Promote then, as an object of primary importance, in&s;titutions for the general diffu&s;ion of knowledge; in proportion as the &s;tructure of a government gives force to public opinion, it is e&s;&s;ential that public opinion &s;hould be en|lightened."</P>
<P>Ye winds, waft the&s;e &s;entiments on your &s;wift pinions; and ye &s;un-beams re|cord them in more than golden characters, throughout the political world!</P>
<P>American, Engli&s;h, French, and all other politicians, hear him who was as famous in the cabinet, as formidable in the tented field! In proportion as he is regarded, will be prevented the effu&s;ion of blood; ho&s;tilities will cea&s;e, and order and confidence between rulers and the ruled, individuals and nations, will en&s;ue.</P>
<P>The e&s;&s;ential advantages of religion, in a political light, were di&s;covered clearly, and felt impre&s;&s;ively by the American &s;age, who&s;e eagle eye di&s;tin|gui&s;hed plainly betwixt vain <HI>pretenders</HI> to religion, and its <HI>real po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors;</HI> and who&s;e cool deliberative &s;agacity, di&s;cerned the difference between genuine re|ligion, as delineated in the holy &s;criptures, and the empty forms, gro&s;s adulter|ations, and &s;hameful abu&s;es of it. And it is difficult to determine, whether he were mo&s;t correct and eminent in religious theory or practice. But one thing, and that of va&s;t importance, is evident: Bright as this &s;un of human glory &s;hone, with the &s;weetly blended rays of morality and religion, through every &s;tage, and in every condition of life, like the cloudle&s;s &s;tar of day, gently and with increa&s;ing maje&s;ty, &s;inking beneath the we&s;tern horizon, his mild effulgence was greate&s;t in death!</P>

Rea&s;on and experience render it probable, and thy word, which is truth, a&s;&s;ures us, that all things, however di&s;tre&s;&s;ing in them&s;elves, are intere&s;ting in their i&s;&s;ues to all who love and &s;erve thee. This is our con&s;olation under the bereavement and great lo&s;s &s;uffered by our nation, in the removal of thy &s;ervant, the commander in chief of her armies, from time to eternity. It is the Lord of Ho&s;ts, and judge of the whole earth, who hath done it. Though we mourn, we do not murmur; nor is our &s;orrow like theirs who have no hope. By the light of divine revelation thou ha&s;t graciou&s;ly enlarged our mental pro&s;pects, and ena|bled us to di&s;cover thy kind &s;uperintendence of our affairs.</HI></P>
<P><HI>With unfeigned gratitude we acknowledge that thou ha&s;t done great things for, and by our decea&s;ed brother: We render thee our united thanks for his crea|tion; for the amiable and excellent di&s;po&s;itions, &s;ound principles and uncommon abilities which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; for his wonderful pre&s;ervation thro' an awful &s;eries of dangers; for the many e&s;&s;ential &s;ervices he rendered our country; and more e&s;|pecially for the hope and fortitude, &s;erenity and compo&s;ure, with which he re&s;igned his &s;oul to thee.</HI></P>
<P><HI>We prai&s;e thee as the God of Grace for the fair examples of public and private virtue, and of eminent piety which he has left for our imitation. And permit us
<PB REF="037634_0018_100EF06599D17F40">
to be&s;eech thee of thine infinite goodne&s;s, to &s;anctify his di&s;&s;olution to this weeping country. May a double portion of the admirable &s;pirit which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, re&s;t on our Rulers! that all who are clothed with either legi&s;lative, judicial, or execu|tive power, may be in&s;trumental in pre&s;erving our many and di&s;tingui&s;hed ble&s;&s;ings, and in effectually promoting all the important intere&s;ts of the&s;e United States. And may that firm per&s;ua&s;ion of the importance of Religion, which eminently d&s;tin|gui&s;hed the invaluable decea&s;ed, &s;o pervade and penetrate our own, and the minds of our fellow-citizens, that the ble&s;&s;ed Go&s;pel may diffu&s;e its divine influence, and exert its transforming efficacy throughout this favored land! that all vice may be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, virtue and piety promoted, our excellent government perpetuated, and our civil and religious liberties and privileges, tran&s;mitted unimpaired to the late&s;t po&s;terity!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Grant the&s;e ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ings, and &s;peedily extend, not only thy providential, but &s;pecial, goodne&s;s and mercy to all men, we humbly entreat thee, O God! for the &s;ake of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, our only and divine Mediator, to whom with thee, and the &s;pirit of all grace, be cordially a&s;cribed all honor and dominion, by men and an|gels, world without end! Amen.</HI></P>
