<P>THE Legi&s;lature of the UNITED STATES, by the act lately pa&s;&s;ed for an Uniform Sy&s;tem of, Bankruptcy, having adopted the Principles of the Bankrupt Laws of England, the Author of this Pub|lication, conceived that a &s;et of Precedents adapted to the Practice, would be acceptable to the Gentlemen of the Profe&s;&s;ion, and others who may be concerned in pro&s;ecuting Commi&s;&s;ions under the &s;aid Act.&mdash;The following are therefore offered to the Public, which have been &s;elected chiefly from tho&s;e now in u&s;e in England; but where circum&s;tances vary he has en|deavored to form others, which it is pre&s;umed will an&s;wer the purpo&s;es or which they are de&s;igned.&mdash;The Engli&s;h forms of legal Proceedings, being gene|rally con&s;idered too redundant for the Practice of this Country, the Author has aimed at brevity, as much as appeared to him con&s;i&s;tent with nece&s;&s;ary expla|nation.&mdash;A few Ob&s;ervations are inter&s;per&s;ed with a view to facilitate a regular mode of Practice, and it is expected the work will be found of &s;ome utility.</P>
