<OPENER><SALUTE>FRIENDS AND BRETHREN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHILE we were yet in affliction, occa|&s;ioned by the death of our late EXCELLENT GOVER|NOR, taken from the head of this Commonwealth, at the meridian of his life, u&s;efulne&s;s and honour; we have been called to a fre&s;h occa&s;ion of public grief and mourning. It hath plea&s;ed Heaven to commi&s;&s;ion the de&s;troying angel to take the life of that ILLUSTRIOUS MAN, whom we have &s;o long delighted to honour, as the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed friend and benefactor of our nation; and one of the brighte&s;t ornaments of the human race.</P>
<P>WHEN the mournful tidings fir&s;t reached our unwilling ear, what heart did not endeavour to find con&s;olation in the hope, that the painful in|telligence might prove premature? But this con|&s;olation was tran&s;ient as the hope that in&s;pired it: and we are left to the full impre&s;&s;ion of the mel|ancholy truth, that the Father of our country is no more.&mdash;Yes; a nation involved in undi&s;&s;embled grief; the mourners, who, in &s;low and &s;ad pro|ce&s;&s;ion, go about the &s;treets; this &s;olemn a&s;&s;embly; the&s;e &s;able &s;igns of &s;orrow and of death; the
<PB N="6" REF="038305_0005_10119D918D43D7F0">
gloomy rites and &s;ervice to which we devote this day, proclaim, that WASHINGTON has departed, never to return.</P>
<P>HE has, at length, retired beyond the reach of his country's call, at which he &s;o often came to her aid. And the knowledge that he lives is no long|er a &s;ource of plea&s;ing reflection to our minds, and of &s;ecurity to our nation. The public has, indeed, &s;u&s;tained a lo&s;s, which true patrioti&s;m will deeply deplore; and every heart experiences a wound, on its individual peace, which will not be &s;oon healed. But it would be unworthy of the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, to indulge that extravagant and &s;elfi&s;h &s;orrow, which, precluding reflection, gratitude and piety, refu&s;es to be comforted.</P>
<P>IT is true, our WASHINGTON is taken away; but this implies, that he was fir&s;t given: And we have le&s;s rea&s;on to grieve at his recal, than to re|joice, that he was &s;o long lent to our country, and to the world. It is con&s;oling al&s;o to reflect, that he departed in a manner worthy of him&s;elf. He died as he had lived&mdash;like a Hero and a Chri&s;tian. Thus he con&s;ummated his character, and acquired fre&s;h glory in death.</P>
<P>THE painful void in our minds, occa&s;ioned by his removal from earth, is in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;up|plied by the bright image of what he was; and the contemplation of the benefits which have flow|ed, and may &s;till flow, to his country, and to man|kind,
<PB N="7" REF="038305_0006_10119D931BBBCAE0">
from his glorious life and example. Such is the ju&s;t pride we take in his character; and &s;uch the gratitude we feel for his &s;ervices, that we love to dwell on his great actions; and feel intere&s;ted in every circum&s;tance of his exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>TO &s;elect with judgment, and relate with impar|tial truth and dignified &s;implicity, the principal in|cidents, tran&s;actions and &s;ervices of his life, would be pronouncing the be&s;t eulogy on his talents and virtues; and thus would be fulfilled, to your en|tire &s;atisfaction, one of the duties of this great oc|ca&s;ion. But the &s;peaker fore&s;ees, with regret, the very imperfect manner, in which, at a &s;hort notice and unexpected call, he will perform a &s;ervice, to which, had he ample time for reflection; for the choice and arrangement of materials; and for &s;eeking out acceptable words, he could not flatter him&s;elf, that he would be able to do ju&s;tice. Nor can he hope to di&s;charge the duty a&s;&s;igned him, in that impre&s;&s;ive manner, in which it would have been performed, by another, could entreaty have prevailed with him to have made the attempt.</P>
<P>IN the country, which WASHINGTON was de&s;tined gloriou&s;ly to defend, and e&s;&s;entially &s;erve, he "viewed the native &s;oil of him&s;elf and his progenitors for &s;everal generations." He was born in the year 1732, at the pari&s;h of Wa&s;hing|ton, on the banks of the Rappahannock, in Virginia. The 22d of February, according to the pre&s;ent &s;tyle, has been too long di&s;tingui&s;hed in our calendars;
<PB N="8" REF="038305_0007_10119D96360237B8">
and its annual return too often celebrated with fe&s;tivity and joy, not to be known as the day of his birth. Never may it be blotted from the days of the year; nor cea&s;e to be numbered in the months. Let the light &s;hine upon it; let no cloud ob&s;cure its lu&s;tre: And as for the night thereof, let the &s;tars appear, in all their number, magnificence, and beauty.</P>
<P>"HIS education having been principally con|ducted by a private tutor, at fifteen years of age he was entered a mid&s;hipman on board a ve&s;&s;el of war." He appears to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a native for|titude of mind, which did not &s;hrink at the pro&s;|pect of toil and danger. But Providence had de&s;tined him to other, if not le&s;s toil&s;ome and hazardous, &s;cenes, than tho&s;e he contemplated. Of his father he had been deprived by death, at the age of ten years. The affection of his &s;urviving parent rendered her reluctant at his engaging in the naval profe&s;&s;ion; in con&s;equence of which, he relinqui&s;hed his purpo&s;e. His regard to filial duty, the obligation of which the wi&s;e and good have, in all ages, felt and acknowledged, was re|warded by days not only long, but glorious.</P>
<P>IN the nineteenth year of his age, he received an appointment in the militia, with the rank of major. When he had completed but twenty-one years, &s;uch was the opinion entertained of his in|telligence, and addre&s;s, that he was employed on an important public mi&s;&s;ion; the objects of which
<PB N="9" REF="038305_0008_10119D9A69DB7FF8">
were, to inquire into the &s;tate of facts, relative to the encroachments, by the French, on the we&s;tern frontier; to remon&s;trate again&s;t their ho&s;tile pro|cedure; and to treat with the natives of the wil|derne&s;s. The &s;urpri&s;e occa&s;ioned by employing a youth on a mi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch difficulty and magni|tude, was exceeded only by that, which was ex|cited, by his di&s;charging its duties, with a forti|tude, judgment, and preci&s;ion, that would have reflected honour on the mature&s;t age and expe|rience.</P>
<P>THE following year, we find him the Colonel of a regiment; rai&s;ed by Virginia, for the pur|po&s;e of re&s;i&s;ting the French aggre&s;&s;ions. With the troops, intru&s;ted to his command, he ha&s;ten|ed to the &s;cene of conte&s;t. In an attack, which he made on a con&s;iderable party of the enemy, he proved victorious. But a&s;&s;ailed, in his turn, by a greatly &s;uperior force, he was obliged, after a brave defence, in which were killed and wounded more than one third of his men, to accept an hon|ourable capitulation.</P>
<P>IN the fatal expedition of Braddock, in the year 1755, COLONEL WASHINGTON attended that unfortunate general, in the capacity of an extra aid-de-camp. The wi&s;dom of his advice, and the valour of his conduct, on this occa&s;ion, have been univer&s;ally acknowledged. The fir&s;t was unhappily rejected; but the la&s;t was of &s;ignal
<PB N="10" REF="038305_0009_10119D9D46171CD0">
&s;ervice, in &s;ecuring the retreat, and &s;aving the remnant of a &s;urpri&s;ed and defeated army.</P>
<P>"NOT long after this time, the &s;upreme authori|ty of Virginia, impre&s;&s;ed with a due &s;en&s;e of his merits, gave him, in a new commi&s;&s;ion, the com|mand of all the troops rai&s;ed, and to be rai&s;ed, in that Colony. In the year 1758, he commanded the van brigade of General Forbes's army, in the capture of Fort Duque&s;ne."</P>
<P>THE many dangers through which he had pa&s;&s;|ed, and the uniform wi&s;dom and valour of his conduct, excited attention and admiration, on the other &s;ide of the Atlantic, as well as in America. As though under the impul&s;e of a prophetic &s;pirit, a re&s;pectable writer, of that day, expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in the following manner: "I may point out to the public that heroic youth, Col. WASHING|TON, whom I cannot but hope Providence has hitherto pre&s;erved, in &s;o &s;ignal a manner, for &s;ome important &s;ervice to his country."</P>
<P>IN the year 1759, ho&s;tilities on the frontiers having, in a good mea&s;ure, &s;ub&s;ided, and his health being greatly impaired, by a pulmonary complaint; he was led to a mea&s;ure, which ex|cited the extreme regret of his troops, the re&s;ig|nation of his military command. Happily for his country, his health was gradually re&s;tored. Fond of agriculture, which was congenial with the pu|rity of his mind, and the &s;implicity of his man|ners, he &s;ettled as a planter and farmer, on the
<PB N="11" REF="038305_0010_10119DA08D543F28">
banks of the Potowmac, at his &s;eat, which, from re&s;pect to the gallant Admiral of the name, was called Mount VERNON. About the &s;ame time, he formed that tender connexion of human life, that &s;erved to alleviate the cares and burdens of his elevated &s;tations, and which was di&s;&s;olved but by that event, which breaks a&s;under the deare&s;t ties, and which we this day lament.</P>
<P>HE continued, without any con&s;iderable inter|ruption, at his favourite re&s;idence; attending to agricultural pur&s;uits; and di&s;charging the duties of a member of the A&s;&s;embly, a Magi&s;trate of the county, and Judge of the Court; till he appear|ed in the memorable Congre&s;s of 1774, as a Del|egate from Virginia. He was al&s;o a member of the Congre&s;s, in the following year, when the revolutionary war commenced.</P>
<P>A MOST intere&s;ting and important cri&s;is, in our public affairs, was now arrived. A &s;cene was opening, which called for great talents and vir|tues; and was adapted to put them to the &s;ever|e&s;t trial. In particular, a Commander in Chief, to conduct our military operations, was required; one who had the fortitude and patrioti&s;m, the &s;kill and addre&s;s, to qualify him for the arduous and adventurous undertaking of organizing, re|ducing to order, and &s;ucce&s;sfully directing again&s;t a powerful foe, an army, compo&s;ed of troops, in a great mea&s;ure, without di&s;cipline, with|out habits of &s;ubordination, without military
<PB N="12" REF="038305_0011_10119DA355062BF0">
&s;tores; and at a time when our country had form|ed no alliances, provided no funds, and e&s;tabli&s;hed no form of national government.</P>
<P>WHERE was &s;uch a character to be found? Heaven, that had decreed the &s;ucce&s;s of our bold, but righteous, appeal to arms, fore&s;eeing the great occa&s;ion, had provided THE MAN. He was in the mid&s;t of the a&s;&s;embled patriots and &s;ages of the land. His noble per&s;on, his nobler mind, his mil|itary achievements, his fair fame, his wonderful combination of great and requi&s;ite qualities, point|ed him out to the venerable guardians of the pub|lic &s;afety, as with a &s;un beam. With one voice, they called him to the arduous employment, and bid him go and SAVE HIS COUNTRY.</P>
<P>"THE HERO comes;" but with that amiable di&s;|tru&s;t of his own abilities, and that reliance on the aid of Divine Providence, which are characteri&s;tic of great minds; and which he manife&s;ted, on all occa&s;ions. The &s;atisfaction and joy, with which he was welcomed to this vicinity, then the &s;cene of war, cannot be ea&s;ily conceived, by tho&s;e, who&s;e age and power of recollection do not ena|ble them to recall to their minds that intere&s;ting period. When the eye &s;aw him, then it ble&s;&s;ed him; and they were thought the happie&s;t, who could fir&s;t gain a &s;ight of his per&s;on. It would not be indulging to fancy, but reciting a fact, &s;hould it be &s;aid, that &s;uch were the di&s;po&s;itions with which he was regarded, as that it was deem|ed
<PB N="13" REF="038305_0012_10119DA7702BE8C0">
an opportunity, too precious to be lo&s;t, "to touch the hem of his garment."</P>
<P>THE effects of his per&s;onal influence, and of his wi&s;e coun&s;els and orders, in the introduction of &s;y&s;tem; in the adju&s;tment, and prevention of di&s;|putes relating to rank; in promoting order, di&s;|cipline, and economy, through the military de|partment, were &s;oon felt; and, during the war, proved of un&s;peakable advantage.</P>
<P>IT was not long before our enemies, in con&s;e|quence of the judicious and &s;pirited mea&s;ures, which were adopted under his direction, were obliged to evacuate the adjacent capital. This important event delivered you from the immedi|ate evils and de&s;olating effects of war. The pre&s;|ent increa&s;ed and pro&s;perous condition of this town, compared with the decayed and ruinous appearance it then exhibited; while it excites your gratitude to Heaven, may well &s;erve to increa&s;e your affectionate regard to the memory of him, who was employed as a principal in&s;trument in producing the agreeable change.</P>
<P>NEARLY as the various events and circum&s;tances of the war are connected with WASHINGTON's glory, it will not be expected that I &s;hall attempt to recite them. You have, indeed, &s;een with your eyes, and heard with your ears, the glorious and &s;ucce&s;sful manner, in which he conducted our mil|itary operations. Innumerable were the difficul|ties and di&s;couragements, that he had to encoun|ter,
<PB N="14" REF="038305_0013_10119DAA378BC9A0">
and a&s;toni&s;hing the wi&s;dom, fortitude and per&s;everance, with which he met and &s;urmount|ed them. The toils and anxieties he endured; the per&s;onal dangers he braved; the important victories he won; and the glorious conclu&s;ion of his military career, are already recorded in the annals of his country; and will be handed down by the faithful hi&s;torian, for the in&s;truction and admiration of future ages.</P>
<P>HAVING &s;et the &s;eal to his patrioti&s;m, and evinced the moderation and greatne&s;s of his &s;oul, by cheerfully re&s;igning his military commi&s;&s;ion into the hand of the Civil Power that gave it; and withdrawing to the humble &s;cenes and occu|pations of private life, we were ready to imagine, that the mea&s;ure of his glory was full. Not ade|quately conceiving of the amplitude of his mind, and wonderful diver&s;ity of his talents; nor fore|&s;eeing the future exigencies of the public, we thought nothing remained for him to perform, by which he could increa&s;e the obligations of his country; and acquire an acce&s;&s;ion of fame. But how were we deceived in our views! Obedient to the voice of patrioti&s;m, he again appeared on the great theatre of action; rendering exalted &s;ervices to our nation, and reaping a fre&s;h harve&s;t of glory.</P>
<P>HE a&s;&s;i&s;ted and pre&s;ided in the deliberations of the Convention that formed, and recommended to the adoption of the people, that Con&s;titution
<PB N="15" REF="038305_0014_10119DABF22BAC78">
of national Government, which has proved &s;o rich a ble&s;&s;ing to our land. When this Con&s;titu|tion was introduced, in the year 1789, he was call|ed by the unanimous &s;uffrages of his country, to the high &s;tation of PRESIDENT of the UNITED STATES: and at the expiration of the fir&s;t pre&s;i|dential term, the &s;ame &s;ignal proof of the public affection and confidence, was repeated.</P>
<P>IN the exertions he contributed towards organ|izing and bringing into operation our new Gov|ernment; in watching over the public peace, or|der, and happine&s;s; in defending our rights, as a free and independent nation, again&s;t the dangers, which threatened them, from abroad, and at home; and in the manner of his di&s;charging, for eight years, the multiplied and arduous duties of the Supreme Executive Power, without the aid of precedents, or foot&s;teps, to guide him in the doubtful cour&s;e, he di&s;covered a vigilance and fore&s;ight, integrity and firmne&s;s, patrioti&s;m and ability, which excited admiration, in foreign coun|tries; and greatly increa&s;ed that debt of grati|tude, which was before due to him, from his own. But judging it compatible with duty, and the ex|i&s;ting &s;tate of public affairs, he declined the future &s;uffrages of his country, and indulged his inclina|tion, in relinqui&s;hing the power and elevation of office, for the &s;hade of retirement.</P>
<P>HIS country was again in danger; and re|quired his aid. Still animated by the patrioti&s;m
<PB N="16" REF="038305_0015_10119DAD88162120">
which had &s;o long been the ruling principle of his conduct, he con&s;ented to re&s;ume the military char|acter; and accepted the command of our armies. He appears, however, not to have relinqui&s;hed, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, the generous re&s;olution to which, during his former high employments, he had uniformly adhered, of not accepting any pe|cuniary con&s;ideration, exceeding the amount of expen&s;es actually incurred, in the public &s;ervice. His appearance in the field, not becoming nece&s;&s;a|ry, he continued his dignified retirement at Mount Vernon; where, with a fortitude and compo&s;ure that agreed with the tenour of his life, he has at la&s;t fallen in that "war in which there is no di&s;|charge."</P>
<P>HE di&s;played a wonderful con&s;i&s;tency of charac|ter. In all &s;ituations and circum&s;tances, whether pro&s;perous or adver&s;e, he was like him&s;elf; col|lected and &s;erene, wi&s;e and temperate, firm and dignified. He appeared, in the various &s;cenes of his life, to be under the commanding influence of a principle &s;uperior to every other, in forming a con&s;i&s;tent, u&s;eful, and truly great character; a principle of moral rectitude, or duty. "He put on righteou&s;ne&s;s, and it clothed him: his judg|ment was as a robe, and a diadem."</P>
<P>PRUDENCE, if not the mo&s;t &s;plendid, is one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful, virtues; and it belonged to WASH|INGTON, in an eminent degree. His prudent and cautious temper, originating, not in &s;ini&s;ter
<PB N="17" REF="038305_0016_10119DB347B9FB48">
views, but in a &s;olicitude to conduct with propri|ety and u&s;efulne&s;s, was always combined, in pro|portion as the path of rectitude was obvious, with deci&s;ion and firmne&s;s.</P>
<P>HE viewed &s;ubjects accurately and comprehen|&s;ively, or in their various connexions, tendencies, and remote, as well as immediate, effects: and knew how to wait for the beneficial, though di&s;|tant, re&s;ult of wi&s;e mea&s;ures and upright conduct. Such was his excellent judgment of men and things, that it not only indicated a natural &s;trength of mind, and a habit of attentive ob&s;ervation; but implied the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e amiable moral qual|ities, which, by precluding prejudice, pa&s;&s;ion, and all unworthy motives, &s;erve to clear the mental &s;ight, prevent illu&s;ions, and cau&s;e every object to appear in its true form.</P>
<P>HIS private life, as well as his public, was a mod|el of propriety and greatne&s;s. It was di&s;tingui&s;hed by temperance, &s;elf-government, &s;implicity and purity of manners; by integrity and honour; by indu&s;try, per&s;everance, and the love of order; by the mild virtues of humanity, and pervading in|fluence of rational piety.</P>
<P>THE more we examine and contemplate his character, in the various parts, and in the &s;ublime whole; the more it excites our admiration. It is not every country, nor every age, that produces a WASHINGTON. Might I not, with more pro|priety,
<PB N="18" REF="038305_0017_10119DB79403B010">
a&s;k, what country, or what age, has this honour, but our own? If we compare this great Man with the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed characters of an|cient, or modern, times, will he not appear &s;till greater by the compari&s;on? ALEXANDER has been called the Great; but how contemptible did he appear, in his &s;cenes of intemperance and riot! How de&s;erving of the deepe&s;t abhorrence, when he &s;lew his friend, becau&s;e he would not flatter! But what act of inju&s;tice and cruelty; what unmanly vice, or &s;cene of deliberate guilt, injured the private rep|utation; dimini&s;hed confidence in the public char|acter; and tarni&s;hed the bright fame of WASH|INGTON?</P>
<P>MUCH has CAESAR been celebrated, in the an|nals of the world. But he was not great enough to overcome his own ambition and lu&s;t of power. Refu&s;ing to &s;urrender his military command, he pa&s;&s;ed the Rubicon, that bounded his province; de&s;troyed the liberties of his country; and &s;eized the government of the Roman empire. But when was WASHINGTON known to pa&s;s the line, which bounded his rightful authority? Did he ever invade the liberties of the people? or attempt to e&s;tabli&s;h him&s;elf in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of de&s;potic power? No. He knew how to u&s;e power, when intru&s;ted with it for the public good; and that end being accompli&s;hed, how to re&s;ign it. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the government of him&s;elf, he was greater than the ma&s;ter of Rome, and of the world.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="038305_0018_10119DB9426D79A8">THE retirement of CHARLES the Fifth has been often mentioned. But did the gratitude and ble&s;&s;|ings of a nation follow him in his retreat? It is true he retired; and well he might, for penitence and tears. Con&s;idering his per&s;idy and crimes, and the deva&s;tations and mi&s;eries that were the effects of his ambition, it would not have been &s;trange, if, through &s;hame and remor&s;e, he had &s;ought a refuge in the grave.</P>
<P>THE late FREDERICK, of Pru&s;&s;ia, was a great warrior, and renowned monarch. But who, with|out &s;urpri&s;e and indignation, can contemplate him &s;coffing at religion, and endeavouring to under|mine tho&s;e everla&s;ting truths, which are the great &s;upports of &s;ociety, order and happine&s;s, in this life; and open to the virtuous, bright pro&s;pects of felicity and glory, beyond the grave? So did not WASHINGTON. He venerated religion, ob|&s;erved its precepts, and re&s;pected its in&s;titutions.</P>
<P>BUT, alas! the uniformly great and good Man, who&s;e character we &s;o ju&s;tly admire and celebrate, now lives, only in the hearts of his grateful coun|trymen; in the admiration of the world; and in our national independence, peace, and pro&s;perity, to which he &s;o e&s;&s;entially contributed, by his mili|tary achievements; and the con&s;ummate wi&s;dom of his civil admini&s;tration. When he had done more than any other man for his country; when time had &s;cattered &s;ilver locks over his venerable brow; when he was ripe in virtue; when he
<PB N="20" REF="038305_0019_101184D809357BA0">
was full of glory; he was taken to the &s;kies: and &s;hall one, who has long watched and toiled in the &s;ervice of others, never enter into re&s;t? Shall the wi&s;e and faithful never receive their reward?</P>
<P>WHEN a virtuous and beloved parent dies, how natural and becoming is it for the children of the family, not only to mingle their &s;orrows, and to|kens of re&s;pect to his memory, on the &s;ad occa&s;ion; but to regard his faithful coun&s;els and example; and, bani&s;hing forever their animo&s;ities, feel them|&s;elves more endeared to each other, by their com|mon relation to the decea&s;ed! How natural is it for them to honour tho&s;e whom he regarded, and who were the partners of his cares and toils! And how rea&s;onable, that they &s;hould make a wi&s;e u&s;e of the means and advantages, which they may inherit from him, of promoting their mutual wel|fare, honour and happine&s;s!</P>
<P>WE, my Friends and Brethren, with the citizens of the United States, have, indeed, lo&s;t a Father; one, who, in the infancy of our nation, has been pre-eminently u&s;eful, in protecting us by his arm, and guiding us by his coun&s;el. In the &s;incerity of our hearts, we this day offer to his memory the tribute of our tears, gratitude and veneration. Let us never forget his wi&s;e maxims and faithful advice, as expre&s;&s;ed on various occa&s;ions, and e&s;pe|cially as communicated, in his la&s;t &s;olemn and af|fectionate addre&s;s, "The Legacy of the Father of his Country."</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="038305_0020_10119DC1565EDE20">ANIMATED by his re&s;plendent example, may we lead a virtuous, patriotic, pious, life, which is true glory. Let contention, prejudice, party views and &s;pirit, yield to the love of truth, to kind af|fections, and a pure zeal to perpetuate the free gov|ernment, honour, peace and pro&s;perity of our common country.</P>
<P>LET us manife&s;t our veneration for the decea&s;ed, by regarding, with due affection and re&s;pect, his patriotic companions in arms, and wi&s;e a&s;&s;ociates in council and government. ADAMS, his wor|thy &s;ucce&s;&s;or, as Pre&s;ident of the United States; a man who&s;e abilities, integrity and patrioti&s;m have been long tried and approved, has peculiar claims to the e&s;teem and confidence of his country, not only on account of his own great talents, vir|tues and &s;ervices; but in con&s;equence of the cor|dial friend&s;hip, approbation, and &s;upport, which he received from his great Predece&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON, like the great Jewi&s;h leader and law-giver, "put a portion of his honour on" his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, perceiving in him "the &s;pirit of wi&s;|dom." In one of his la&s;t official communications, he explicitly declared, as his opinion, That the mea&s;ures of the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration were "wi&s;e and prudent," and "ought to in&s;pire univer&s;al confidence."</P>
<P>THERE is a &s;orrow for the dead, which is inju&s;tice to the living; and which will by no means corre&s;|pond with the character of the great and good Man,
<PB N="22" REF="038305_0021_10119DC2E021FB90">
who&s;e death we deplore; and who &s;o well knew how to appreciate, and acknowledge, the abilities and virtues of others. By an exce&s;s of grief, or the affectation of it, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, we implicitly reproach &s;urviving patrioti&s;m and tal|ents; and departed worth may be emblazoned, with the view of placing living merit in the &s;hade.</P>
<P>AMERICANS! prize the rich inheritance handed down to you from WASHINGTON and your Fa|thers. Unimpaired, let it be tran&s;mitted to fu|ture generations. Pour the fervent prayer to HEAVEN, that licentious principles and manners; "the infidious wiles of foreign influence;" dome&s;|tic divi&s;ions, contempt of government, and de&s;truc|tive anarchy; e&s;tabli&s;hed de&s;poti&s;m and tyrannic power, may never prevail, and &s;pread their deba&s;|ing influence and de&s;olating effects, in this favour|ed land.</P>
<P>AS an incentive to every thing wi&s;e, virtuous, patriotic and great, cheri&s;h the memory of the departed HERO, PATRIOT and SAGE. Love and defend the country that gave him birth; was the object of his pure affection; the &s;cene of his glo|rious life; and contains his hallowed du&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>The Legacy OF THE Father of his Country. ADDRESS OF GEORGE WASHINGTON, ON DECLINING BEING CONSIDERED A CANDIDATE FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the <HI>PEOPLE</HI> of the <HI>UNITED STATES.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>FRIENDS AND FELLOW-CITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE period for a new election of a citizen, to admini&s;ter the executive government of the United States, being not far di&s;tant, and the time actually arrived, when your thoughts mu&s;t be employed in de&s;ignating the per&s;on, who is to be clothed with that important tru&s;t, it appears to me proper, e&s;pecially as it may conduce to a more di&s;tinct expre&s;&s;ion of the public voice, that I &s;hould now appri&s;e you of the re&s;olution I have formed, to decline being con&s;idered among the number of tho&s;e, out of whom a choice is to be made.</P>
<P>I beg you, at the &s;ame time, to do me the ju&s;tice to be a&s;&s;ured, that this re&s;olution has not been ta|ken without a &s;trict regard to all the con&s;iderations appertaining to the relation, which binds a dutiful citizen to his country; and that, in withdrawing
<PB N="2" REF="038305_0023_10119DC9F379CBA0">
the tender of &s;ervice, which &s;ilence in my &s;ituation might imply, I am influenced by no diminution of zeal for your future intere&s;t; no deficiency of grateful re&s;pect for your pa&s;t kindne&s;s: but am &s;upported by a full conviction that the &s;tep is com|patible with both.</P>
<P>The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in the office to which your &s;uffrages have twice called me, have been a uniform &s;acrifice of inclination to the opinion of duty, and to a deference for what appeared to be your de&s;ire. I con&s;tantly hoped, that it would have been much earlier in my power, con&s;i&s;tently with motives, which I was not at liberty to di&s;regard, to return to that re|tirement, from which I had been reluctantly drawn. The &s;trength of my inclination to do this, previous to the la&s;t election, had even led to the preparation of an addre&s;s to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then perplexed and critical po&s;ture of our affairs with foreign nations, and the unanimous advice of per&s;ons entitled to my confi|dence, impelled me to abandon the idea.</P>
<P>I rejoice, that the &s;tate of your concerns, exter|nal as well as internal, no longer renders the pur|&s;uit of inclination incompatible with the &s;entiment of duty, or propriety; and am per&s;uaded, whatever partiality may be retained for my &s;ervices, that, in the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of our country, you will not di&s;approve my determination to retire.</P>
<P>The impre&s;&s;ions, with which I fir&s;t undertook the arduous tru&s;t, were explained on the proper oc|ca&s;ion. In the di&s;charge of this tru&s;t, I will only &s;ay, that I have, with good intentions, contributed towards the organization and admini&s;tration of the government, the be&s;t exertions of which a very falli|ble judgment was capable. Not uncon&s;cious, in the
<PB N="3" REF="038305_0024_10119DCD1A1A9630">
out&s;et, of the inferiority of my qualifications, expe|rience, in my own eyes, perhaps &s;till more in the eyes of others, has &s;trengthened the motives to dif|fidence of my&s;elf; and every day the increa&s;ing weight of years admoni&s;hes me more and more, that the &s;hade of retirement is as nece&s;&s;ary to me as it will be welcome. Satisfied that if any cir|cum&s;tances have given peculiar value to my &s;er|vices, they were temporary, I have the con&s;olation to believe, that, while choice and prudence invite me to quit the political &s;cene, patrioti&s;m does not for|bid it.</P>
<P>In looking forward to the moment, which is in|tended to terminate the career of my public life, my feelings do not permit me to &s;u&s;pend the deep ac|knowledgment of that debt of gratitude, which I owe to my beloved country, for the many honours it has conferred upon me; &s;till more for the &s;ted|fa&s;t confidence with which it has &s;upported me; and for the opportunities I have thence enjoyed of manife&s;ting my inviolable attachment, by &s;ervices faithful and per&s;evering, though in u&s;efulne&s;s une|qual to my zeal. If benefits have re&s;ulted to our country from the&s;e &s;ervices, let it always be remem|bered to your prai&s;e, and as an in&s;tructive example in our annals, that under circum&s;tances in which the pa&s;&s;ions, agitated in every direction, were liable to mi&s;lead&mdash;amid&s;t appearances &s;ometimes dubi|ous &mdash;vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune often di&s;couraging&mdash;in &s;ituations in which, not unfrequently, want of &s;ucce&s;s has countenanced the &s;pirit of critici&s;m&mdash;the con|&s;tancy of your &s;upport was the e&s;&s;ential prop of the efforts, and a guarantee of the plans, by which they were effected. Profoundly penetrated with this idea, I &s;hall carry it with me to my grave, as a &s;trong incitement to uncea&s;ing vows, that Heaven
<PB N="4" REF="038305_0025_10119DCFF39C47C0">
may continue to you the choice&s;t tokens of its be|neficence &mdash;that your union and brotherly affection may be perpetual&mdash;that the free con&s;titution, which is the work of your hands, may be &s;acredly main|tained &mdash;that its admini&s;tration, in every depart|ment, may be &s;tamped with wi&s;dom and virtue&mdash; that, in fine, the happine&s;s of the people of the&s;e States, under the au&s;pices of liberty, may be made complete, by &s;o careful a pre&s;ervation and &s;o prudent a u&s;e of this ble&s;&s;ing, as will acquire to them the glory of recommending it to the ap|plau&s;e, the affection, and adoption, of every nation which is yet a &s;tranger to it.</P>
<P>HERE, perhaps, I ought to &s;top. But a &s;olicitude for your welfare, which cannot end but with my life, and the apprehen&s;ion of danger, natural to that &s;olicitude, urge me, on an occa&s;ion like the pre&s;ent, to offer to your &s;olemn contemplation, and to recommend to your frequent review, &s;ome &s;enti|ments, which are the re&s;ult of much reflection, of no incon&s;iderable ob&s;ervation, and which appear to me all-important to the permanency of your felici|ty as a people. The&s;e will be offered to you with the more freedom, as you can only &s;ee in them the di&s;intere&s;ted warnings of a parting friend, who can po&s;&s;ibly have no per&s;onal motive to bias his coun&s;el. Nor can I forget, as an encouragement to it, your indulgent reception of my &s;entiments on a former and not di&s;&s;imilar occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your hearts, no recommendation of mine is nece&s;&s;ary to fortify or confirm the attach|ment.</P>
<P>The unity of government, which con&s;titutes you one people, is al&s;o now dear to you. It is ju&s;tly
<PB N="5" REF="038305_0026_10119DD182DAFCD0">
&s;o; for it is a main pillar in the edifice of your real independence; the &s;upport of your tranquillity at home, your peace abroad; of your &s;afety; of your pro&s;perity; of that very liberty which you &s;o highly prize. But, as it is ea&s;y to fore&s;ee, that from different cau&s;es and from different quarters, much pains will be taken, many artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth; as this is the point, in your political fortre&s;s, again&s;t which the batteries of internal and exter|nal enemies will be mo&s;t con&s;tantly and actively (though often covertly and in&s;idiou&s;ly) directed, it is of infinite moment that you &s;hould properly e&s;timate the immen&s;e value of your National Union, to your collective and individual happine&s;s; that you &s;hould cheri&s;h a cordial, habitual and immove|able attachment to it; accu&s;toming your&s;elves to think and &s;peak of it as of the palladium of your political &s;afety and pro&s;perity; watching for its pre&s;ervation with jealous anxiety; di&s;countenan|cing whatever may &s;ugge&s;t even a &s;u&s;picion that it can in any event be abandoned; and indignantly frowning upon the fir&s;t dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the re&s;t, or to enfeeble the &s;acred ties which now link to|gether the various parts.</P>
<P>For this, you have every inducement of &s;ympathy and intere&s;t. Citizens, by birth or choice, of a common country, that country has a right to con|centrate your affections. The name of AMERICAN, which belongs to you, in your national capacity, mu&s;t always exalt the ju&s;t pride of patrioti&s;m, more than any appellation derived from local di&s;crimi|nations. With &s;light &s;hades of difference, you have the &s;ame religion, manners, habits and polit|ical principles. You have, in a common cau&s;e,
<PB N="6" REF="038305_0027_10119DD456192A60">
fought and triumphed together; the independence and liberty you po&s;&s;e&s;s are the work of joint coun|cils, and joint efforts, of common dangers, &s;uffer|ings and &s;ucce&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>But the&s;e con&s;iderations, however powerfully they addre&s;s them&s;elves to your &s;en&s;ibility, are greatly out-weighed by tho&s;e which apply more immediately to your intere&s;t.&mdash;Here every portion of our country finds the mo&s;t commanding motives for carefully guarding and pre&s;erving the union of the whole.</P>
<P>The North, in an unre&s;trained intercour&s;e with the South, protected by the equal laws of a com|mon government, finds in the productions of the latter, great additional re&s;ources of maritime and commercial enterprize, and precious materials of manufacturing indu&s;try. The South, in the &s;ame intercour&s;e, benefiting by the agency of the North, &s;ees its agriculture grow and its commerce expand. Turning partly into its own channels the &s;eamen of the North, it finds its particular nav|igation invigorated; and while it contributes, in different ways, to nouri&s;h and increa&s;e the general ma&s;s of the national navigation, it looks forward to the protection of a maritime &s;trength, to which it|&s;elf is unequally adapted. The Ea&s;t, in a like in|tercour&s;e with the We&s;t, already finds, and, in the progre&s;&s;ive improvement of interior communica|tions, by land and water, will more and more find, a valuable vent for the commodities which it brings from abroad, or manufactures at home. The We&s;t derives from the Ea&s;t &s;upplies requi&s;ite to its growth and comfort; and, what is perhaps of &s;till greater con&s;equence, it mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity owe the &s;ecure enjoyment of indi&s;pen&s;able outlets for its own productions to the weighty influence, and the
<PB N="7" REF="038305_0028_101184D9902B30D0">
future maritime &s;trength of the Atlantic &s;ide of the Union, directed by an indi&s;&s;oluble community of intere&s;t as one nation. Any other tenure, by which the We&s;t can hold this e&s;&s;ential advantage, whether derived from its own &s;eparate &s;trength, or from an apo&s;tate and unnatural connexion with any foreign power, mu&s;t be intrin&s;ically precarious.</P>
<P>While, then, every part of our country thus feels an immediate and particular intere&s;t in Union, all the parts combined cannot fail to find, in the united ma&s;s of means and efforts, greater &s;trength, greater re&s;ource, proportionably greater &s;ecurity from ex|ternal danger, a le&s;s frequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations; and, what is of mo&s;t ine&s;|timable value! they mu&s;t derive from Union an exemption from tho&s;e broils and wars between them&s;elves, which &s;o frequently afflict neighbour|ing countries, not tied together by the &s;ame gov|ernment; which their own rival&s;hips alone would be &s;ufficient to produce, but which oppo&s;ite foreign alliances, attachments and intrigues would &s;timu|late and embitter. Hence, likewi&s;e, they will avoid the nece&s;&s;ity of tho&s;e overgrown military e&s;tabli&s;h|ments, which, under any form of government, are inau&s;picious to liberty, and which are to be re|garded as particularly ho&s;tile to Republican Liberty. In this &s;en&s;e it is, that your Union ought to be con|&s;idered as a main prop of your Liberty, and that the love of the one ought to endear to you the pre&s;|ervation of the other.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations &s;peak a per&s;ua&s;ive language to every reflecting and virtuous mind, and exhibit the continuance of the UNION as a primary object of patriotic de&s;ire. Is there a doubt, whether a common government can embrace &s;o large a &s;phere? Let experience &s;olve it. To li&s;ten to mere
<PB N="8" REF="038305_0029_10119DD9CAF943E0">
&s;peculation, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, were criminal. We are authori&s;ed to hope, that a proper organization of the whole, with the auxiliary agency of govern|ments for the re&s;pective &s;ubdivi&s;ions, will afford a happy i&s;&s;ue to the experiment. It is well worth a fair and full experiment. With &s;uch powerful and obvious motives to Union, affecting all parts of our country, while experiment &s;hall not have demon|&s;trated its impracticability, there will always be rea&s;on to di&s;tru&s;t the patrioti&s;m of tho&s;e, who in any quarter may endeavour to weaken its bands.</P>
<P>In contemplating the cau&s;es which may di&s;turb our Union, it occurs as matter of &s;erious concern, that any ground &s;hould have been furni&s;hed for characterizing parties, by geographical di&s;crimina|tions &mdash;<HI>Northern</HI> and <HI>Southern&mdash;Atlantic</HI> and <HI>We&s;tern;</HI> whence de&s;igning men may endeavour to excite a belief, that there is a real difference of local inter|e&s;ts and views. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence, within particular di&s;tricts, is to mi&s;repre&s;ent the opinions and aims of other di&s;|tricts. You cannot &s;hield your&s;elves too much again&s;t the jealou&s;ies and heart-burnings which &s;pring from the&s;e mi&s;repre&s;entations; they tend to render alien to each other tho&s;e who ought to be bound together by fraternal affection. The inhabitants of our We&s;tern Country have lately had a u&s;eful le&s;|&s;on on this head: They have &s;een, in the negocia|tion by the Executive, and in the unanimous ratifi|cation by the Senate, of the treaty with Spain, and in the univer&s;al &s;atisfaction at that event, through|out the United States, a deci&s;ive proof how un|founded were the &s;u&s;picions, propagated among them, of a policy in the General Government and in the Atlantic States, unfriendly to their intere&s;ts in regard to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi: They have been wit|ne&s;&s;es
<PB N="9" REF="038305_0030_10119DDC9BE1DCF8">
to the formation of two treaties, that with Great-Britain and that with Spain, which &s;ecure to them every thing they could de&s;ire, in re&s;pect to our foreign relations, towards confirming their pro&s;perity. Will it not be their wi&s;dom to rely, for the pre&s;ervation of the&s;e advantages, on the UNION by which they were procured? Will they not hence|forth be deaf to tho&s;e advi&s;ers, if &s;uch there are, who would &s;ever them from their brethren, and con|nect them with aliens?</P>
<P>To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a government for the whole is indi&s;pen&s;able. No alliances, however &s;trict, between the parts, can be an adequate &s;ub&s;titute; they mu&s;t inevitably expe|rience the infractions and interruptions which all alliances, in all times, have experienced. Sen&s;ible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon your fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay, by the adoption of a Con&s;titution of Government, better calculated than your former, for an intimate Union, and for the efficacious man|agement of your common concerns. This Govern|ment, the offspring of your own choice, uninflu|enced and unawed; adopted upon full inve&s;tigation and mature deliberation; completely free in its prin|ciples; in the di&s;tribution of its powers, uniting &s;e|curity with energy; and containing within it&s;elf a provi&s;ion for its own amendment, has a ju&s;t claim to your confidence and your &s;upport. Re&s;pect for its authority, compliance with its laws, acquie&s;cence in its mea&s;ures, are duties enjoined by the funda|mental maxims of true liberty. The ba&s;is of our political &s;y&s;tems is the right of the people to make and to alter their con&s;titutions of government&mdash; But, the con&s;titution which at any time exi&s;ts, until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people, is &s;acredly obligatory upon all. The
<PB N="10" REF="038305_0031_10119DDE28AF96A0">
very idea of the power and the right of the people to e&s;tabli&s;h government, pre&s;uppo&s;es the duty of every individual to obey the e&s;tabli&s;hed government.</P>
<P>All ob&s;tructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and a&s;&s;ociations, under whatever plau|&s;ible character, with the real de&s;ign to direct, con|trol, counteract or awe the regular deliberation and action of the con&s;tituted authorities, are de&s;tructive of this fundamental principle, and of fatal tenden|cy. They &s;erve to organize faction; to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put in the place of the delegated will of the nation, the will of a party, often a &s;mall, but artful and enterpri&s;ing minority of the community; and, according to the alternate triumph of different parties, to make the public admini&s;tration the mirror of the ill-concerted and incongruous projects of faction, rather than the organ of con&s;i&s;tent and whole&s;ome plans, di|ge&s;ted by common councils, and modified by mu|tual intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>However combinations, or a&s;&s;ociations, of the above de&s;cription, may now and then an&s;wer popu|lar ends, they are likely, in the cour&s;e of time and things, to become potent engines, by which cun|ning, ambitious, and unprincipled men, will be ena|bled to &s;ubvert the power of the people, and to u&s;urp for them&s;elves the reins of government; de&s;troying, afterwards, the very engines which have lifted them to unju&s;t dominion.</P>
<P>Towards the pre&s;ervation of your government, and the permanency of your pre&s;ent happy &s;tate, it is requi&s;ite, not only that you &s;teadily di&s;counte|nance irregular oppo&s;itions to its acknowledged authority, but al&s;o that you re&s;i&s;t, with care, the &s;pirit of innovation upon its principles, however &s;pecious the pretexts. One method of a&s;&s;ault may
<PB N="11" REF="038305_0032_10119DE2AA75B488">
be to effect, in the forms of the Con&s;titution, alter|ations which will impair the energy of the &s;y&s;tem, and thus to undermine what cannot be directly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited, remember that time and habit are at lea&s;t as nece&s;&s;ary to fix the true character of gov|ernments, as of other human in&s;titutions; that ex|perience is the &s;ure&s;t &s;tandard, by which to te&s;t the real tendency of the exi&s;ting con&s;titution of a coun|try; that facility in changes, upon the credit of mere hypothe&s;is and opinion, expo&s;es to perpetual change, from the endle&s;s variety of hypothe&s;is and opinion; and remember, e&s;pecially, that for the ef|ficient management of your common intere&s;ts, in a country &s;o exten&s;ive as ours, a government of as much vigour as is con&s;i&s;tent with the perfect &s;ecu|rity of liberty, is indi&s;pen&s;able. Liberty it&s;elf will find in &s;uch a government, with powers properly di&s;tributed and adju&s;ted, its &s;ure&s;t guardian. It is, indeed, little el&s;e than a name, where the govern|ment is too feeble to with&s;tand the enterpri&s;es of faction, to confine each member of the &s;ociety with|in the limits pre&s;cribed by the laws, and to main|tain all in the &s;ecure and tranquil enjoyment of the rights of per&s;on and property.</P>
<P>I have already intimated to you, the danger of parties in a &s;tate, with particular reference to the founding of them on geographical di&s;criminations. Let me now take a more comprehen&s;ive view, and warn you, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, again&s;t the baneful effects of the &s;pirit of party, generally.</P>
<P>This &s;pirit, unfortunately, is in&s;eparable from our nature, having its root in the &s;tronge&s;t pa&s;|&s;ions of the human mind. It exi&s;ts, under different &s;hapes, in all governments, more or le&s;s &s;tifled, con|trolled, or repre&s;&s;ed; but in tho&s;e of the popular

<P>The alternate domination of one faction over another, &s;harpened by the &s;pirit of revenge, natural to party di&s;&s;en&s;ion, which, in different ages and coun|tries, has perpetrated the mo&s;t horrid enormities, is it&s;elf a frightful de&s;poti&s;m: But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent de&s;poti&s;m. The di&s;orders and mi&s;eries, which re&s;ult, gradually incline the minds of men to &s;eek &s;ecurity and re|po&s;e in the ab&s;olute power of an individual; and, &s;ooner or later, the chief of &s;ome prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this di&s;po&s;ition to the purpo&s;es of his own ele|vation, on the ruins of public liberty.</P>
<P>Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind (which neverthele&s;s ought not to be entirely out of &s;ight) the common and continual mi&s;chiefs of the &s;pirit of party are &s;ufficient to make it the intere&s;t and duty of a wi&s;e people to di&s;courage and re&s;train it.</P>
<P>It &s;erves always to di&s;tract the public councils, and enfeeble the public admini&s;tration. It agitates the community with ill-founded jealou&s;ies and fal&s;e alarms; kindles the animo&s;ity of one part again&s;t another; and foments, occa&s;ionally, riot and in&s;ur|rection. It opens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which find a facilitated acce&s;s to the government it&s;elf, through the channels of party pa&s;&s;ions. Thus the policy and will of one country are &s;ubjected to the policy and will of another.</P>
<P>There is an opinion, that parties in free countries are u&s;eful checks upon the admini&s;tration of the gov|ernment, and &s;erve to keep alive the &s;pirit of liberty. This, within certain limits, is probably true; and

in governments of a monarchical ca&s;t, patrioti&s;m may look with indulgence, if not with favour, upon the &s;pirit of party. But in tho&s;e of the popular character, in governments purely elective, it is a &s;pirit not to be encouraged. From their natural tendency, it is certain, there will always be enough of that &s;pirit for every &s;alutary purpo&s;e: and there being con&s;tant danger of exce&s;s, the effort ought to be, by force of public opinion, to mitigate and a&s;|&s;uage it. A fire not to be quenched, it demands a uniform vigilance to prevent its bur&s;ting into a flame, le&s;t, in&s;tead of warming, it &s;hould con&s;ume.</P>
<P>It is important, likewi&s;e, that the habits of think|ing, in a free country, &s;hould in&s;pire caution in tho&s;e entru&s;ted with its admini&s;tration, to confine them|&s;elves within their re&s;pective con&s;titutional &s;pheres, avoiding, in the exerci&s;e of the powers of one de|partment, to encroach upon another. The &s;pirit of encroachment tends to con&s;olidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to create, what|ever be the form of government, a real de&s;poti&s;m. A ju&s;t e&s;timate of that love of power, and pronene&s;s to abu&s;e it, which predominates in the human heart, is &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy us of the truth of this po&s;ition. The nece&s;&s;ity of reciprocal checks in the exerci&s;e of political power, by dividing and di&s;trib|uting it into different depo&s;itories, and con&s;titut|ing each the guardian of the public weal again&s;t inva&s;ions by the others, has been evinced by experi|ments, ancient and modern; &s;ome of them in our country, and under our own eyes. To pre&s;erve them, mu&s;t be as nece&s;&s;ary as to in&s;titute them. If, in the opinion of the people, the di&s;tribution or modification of the con&s;titutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be corrected by an amend|ment in the way which the Con&s;titution de&s;ignates.

But let there be no change by u&s;urpation; for though this, in one in&s;tance, may be the in&s;tru|ment of good, it is the cu&s;tomary weapon by which free governments are de&s;troyed. The precedent mu&s;t always greatly overbalance, in permanent evil, any partial or tran&s;ient benefit which the u&s;e can at any time yield.</P>
<P>Of all the di&s;po&s;itions and habits, which lead to political pro&s;perity, religion and morality are indi&s;|pen&s;able &s;upports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patrioti&s;m, who &s;hould labour to &s;ub|vert the&s;e great pillars of human happine&s;s, the&s;e firme&s;t props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to re&s;pect and to cheri&s;h them. A volume could not trace all their connexions with public and private felicity. Let it be &s;imply a&s;ked, Where is the &s;ecurity for property, for reputation, for life, if a &s;en&s;e of religious obligation <HI>de&s;ert</HI> the oaths which are the in&s;truments of inve&s;tigation in courts of ju&s;tice? And let us with caution indulge the &s;up|po&s;ition, that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influ|ence of refined education, on minds of peculiar &s;tructure; rea&s;on and experience both forbid us to expect, that national morality can prevail, in exclu|&s;ion of religious principle.</P>
<P>It is &s;ub&s;tantially true, that virtue or morality is a nece&s;&s;ary &s;pring of popular government. The rule, indeed, extends, with more or le&s;s force, to ev|ery &s;pecies of free government. Who, that is a &s;in|cere friend to it, can look with indifference upon at|tempts to &s;hake the foundation of the fabric?</P>

In proportion as the &s;tructure of a govern|ment gives force to public opinion, it is e&s;&s;ential that public opinion &s;hould be enlightened.</P>
<P>As a very important &s;ource of &s;trength and &s;ecu|rity, cheri&s;h public credit. One method of pre|&s;erving it is, to u&s;e it as &s;paringly as po&s;&s;ible; avoid|ing occa&s;ions of expen&s;e by cultivating peace; but remembering al&s;o, that timely di&s;bur&s;ements, to pre|pare for danger, frequently prevent much greater di&s;bur&s;ements to repel it; avoiding, likewi&s;e, the accumulation of debt, not only by &s;hunning occa|&s;ions of expen&s;e, but by vigorous exertions, in time of peace, to di&s;charge the debts which una|voidable wars may have occa&s;ioned, not ungener|ou&s;ly throwing upon po&s;terity the burden which we our&s;elves ought to bear. The execution of the&s;e maxims belongs to your repre&s;entatives, but it is nece&s;&s;ary that public opinion &s;hould co-operate.</P>
<P>To facilitate to them the performance of their duty, it is e&s;&s;ential that you &s;hould practically bear in mind, that towards the payment of debts there mu&s;t be revenue; that to have revenue there mu&s;t be taxes; that no taxes can be devi&s;ed, which are not, more or le&s;s, inconvenient and unplea&s;ant; that the intrin&s;ic embarra&s;&s;ment in&s;eparable from the &s;election of the proper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties) ought to be a deci&s;ive motive for a candid con&s;truction of the conduct of the gov|ernment in making it, and for a &s;pirit of acquie&s;|cence in the mea&s;ures for obtaining revenue, which the public exigencies may at any time dictate.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve good faith and ju&s;tice towards all na|tions; cultivate peace and harmony with all: re|ligion and morality enjoin this conduct; and can it be, that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be worthy of a free, enlightened, and (at no

di&s;tant period) a great nation, to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a peo|ple always guided by an exalted ju&s;tice and benev|olence. Who can doubt, that in the cour&s;e of time and things, the fruits of &s;uch a plan would richly repay any temporary advantages, which might be lo&s;t by a &s;teady adherence to it? Can it be, that Providence has not connected the perma|nent felicity of a nation with its virtue? The ex|periment, at lea&s;t, is recommended by every &s;enti|ment which ennobles human nature. Alas! is it rendered impo&s;&s;ible by its vices?</P>
<P>In the execution of &s;uch a plan, nothing is more e&s;&s;ential, than that permanent, inveterate antipathies again&s;t particular nations, and pa&s;&s;ionate attachments for others, &s;hould be excluded; and that, in the place of them, ju&s;t and amicable feelings towards all &s;hould be cultivated. The nation, which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or an habitual fondne&s;s, is in &s;ome degree a &s;lave. It is a &s;lave to its animo&s;ity or to its affection, either of which is &s;ufficient to lead it a&s;tray from its duty and its in|tere&s;t. Antipathy in one nation again&s;t another, di&s;po&s;es each more readily to offer in&s;ult and injury, to lay hold of &s;light cau&s;es of umbrage, and to be haughty and intractable, when accidental or trifling occa&s;ions of di&s;pute occur. Hence frequent colli&s;|ions, ob&s;tinate, envenomed and bloody conte&s;ts. The nation, prompted by ill will and re&s;entment, &s;ometimes impels to war the government, contrary to the be&s;t calculations of policy. The government &s;ometimes participates in the national propen&s;ity, and adopts, through pa&s;&s;ion, what rea&s;on would re|ject; at other times, it makes the animo&s;ity of the nation &s;ub&s;ervient to the projects of ho&s;tility, in&s;ti|gated by pride, ambition, and other &s;ini&s;ter and per|nicious motives. The peace often, &s;ometimes per|haps the liberty, of nations has been the victim.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="038305_0038_10119DF422EEB408">So, likewi&s;e, a pa&s;&s;ionate attachment of one na|tion for another, produces a variety of evils. Sym|pathy for the favourite nation, facilitating the illu|&s;ion of an imaginary common intere&s;t, in ca&s;es where no real common intere&s;t exi&s;ts, and infu&s;ing into one the enmities of the other, betrays the for|mer into a participation in the quarrels and wars of the latter, without adequate inducement or ju&s;tifi|cation. It leads al&s;o to conce&s;&s;ions to the favourite nation, of privileges denied to others, which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the conce&s;&s;ions; by unnece&s;&s;arily parting with what ought to have been retained; and by exciting jealou&s;y, ill will, and a di&s;po&s;ition to retaliate, in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld: and it gives to ambitious, corrupted, or deluded citizens (who devote them&s;elves to the favourite nation) facility to betray, or &s;acrifice the intere&s;ts of their own country, without odium, &s;ometimes even with pop|ularity; gilding, with the appearances of a virtuous &s;en&s;e of obligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable zeal for public good, the ba&s;e or fooli&s;h compliance, of ambition, corrup|tion, or infatuation.</P>
<P>As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, &s;uch attachments are particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent patriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with dome&s;tic factions, to practi&s;e the arts of &s;educ|tion, to mi&s;lead public opinion, to influence or awe the public councils! Such an attachment of a &s;mall or weak, towards a great and powerful nation, dooms the former to be the &s;atellite of the latter.</P>
<P>Again&s;t the in&s;idious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to believe me, fellow-citizens) the jealou&s;y of a free people ought to be con&s;tantly awake; &s;ince hi&s;tory and experience prove, that
<PB N="18" REF="038305_0039_10119DF820FA5648">
foreign influence is one of the mo&s;t baneful foes of Republican Government. But that jealou&s;y, to be u&s;eful, mu&s;t be impartial; el&s;e it becomes the in&s;tru|ment of the very influence to be avoided, in&s;tead of a defence again&s;t it. Exce&s;&s;ive partiality for one foreign nation, and exce&s;&s;ive di&s;like of another, cau&s;e tho&s;e whom they actuate to &s;ee danger only on one &s;ide, and &s;erve to veil and even &s;econd the arts of influence on the other. Real patriots, who may re&s;i&s;t the intrigues of the favourite, are liable to become &s;u&s;pected and odious; while its tools and dupes u&s;urp the applau&s;e and confidence of the people, to &s;urrender their intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to for|eign nations, is, in extending our commercial re|lations, to have with them as little political connex|ion as po&s;&s;ible. So far as we have already formed engagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith.&mdash;Here let us &s;top.</P>
<P>Europe has a &s;et of primary intere&s;ts, which to us have none, or a very remote relation. Hence &s;he mu&s;t be engaged in frequent controver&s;ies, the cau&s;es of which are e&s;&s;entially foreign to our con|cerns. Hence, therefore, it mu&s;t be unwi&s;e in us to implicate our&s;elves, by artificial ties, in the ordi|nary vici&s;&s;itudes of her politics, or the ordinary com|binations and colli&s;ions of her friend&s;hips or enmities.</P>
<P>Our detached and di&s;tant &s;ituation invites and enables us to pur&s;ue a different cour&s;e. If we re|main one people, under an efficient government, the period is not far off, when we may defy materi|al injury from external annoyance; when we may take &s;uch an attitude, as will cau&s;e the neutrality, we may at any time re&s;olve upon, to be &s;crupulou&s;ly re&s;pected; when belligerent nations, under the im|po&s;&s;ibility of making acqui&s;itions upon us, will not
<PB N="19" REF="038305_0040_10119DFAE84D0058">
lightly hazard the giving us provocation; when we may choo&s;e peace or war, as our intere&s;t, guided by ju&s;tice, &s;hall coun&s;el.</P>
<P>Why forego the advantages of &s;o peculiar a &s;itu|ation? Why quit our own, to &s;tand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our de&s;tiny with that of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and pro&s;perity in the toils of European ambition, rival|&s;hip, intere&s;t, humour or caprice?</P>
<P>It is our true policy to &s;teer clear of permanent alliances, with any portion of the foreign world; &s;o far, I mean, as we are now at liberty to do it: for let me not be under&s;tood as capable of patron|izing infidelity to exi&s;ting engagements. I hold the maxim no le&s;s applicable to public than to pri|vate affairs, that hone&s;ty is always the be&s;t policy. I repeat it, therefore, let tho&s;e engagements be ob|&s;erved in their genuine &s;en&s;e. But, in my opinion, it is unnece&s;&s;ary, and would be unwi&s;e, to extend them.</P>
<P>Taking care always to keep our&s;elves, by &s;uitable e&s;tabli&s;hments, on a re&s;pectable defen&s;ive po&s;ture, we may &s;afely tru&s;t to temporary alliances for extra|ordinary emergencies.</P>
<P>Harmony, liberal intercour&s;e with all nations, are recommended by policy, humanity and intere&s;t. But even our commercial policy, &s;hould hold an equal and impartial hand; neither &s;eeking nor granting exclu&s;ive favours or preferences; con&s;ult|ing the natural cour&s;e of things; diffu&s;ing and di|ver&s;ifying, by gentle means, the &s;treams of com|merce, but forcing nothing; e&s;tabli&s;hing, with the powers &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, in order to give trade a &s;table cour&s;e, to define the rights of our merchants, and to enable the government to &s;upport them, conven|tional rules of intercour&s;e, the be&s;t that pre&s;ent cir|cum&s;tances
<PB N="20" REF="038305_0041_10119DFE8600D998">
and mutual opinion will permit, but temporary, and liable to be from time to time aban|doned or varied, as experience and circum&s;tances &s;hall dictate; con&s;tantly keeping in view, that it is folly in one nation to look for di&s;intere&s;ted favours from another; that it mu&s;t pay, with a portion of its independence, for whatever it may accept under that character; that, by &s;uch acceptance, it may place it&s;elf in the condition of having given equiv|alents for nominal favours, and yet of being re|proached with ingratitude for not giving more. There can be no greater error than to expect or calculate upon real favours from nation to nation. It is an illu&s;ion which experience mu&s;t cure, which a ju&s;t pride ought to di&s;card.</P>
<P>In offering to you, my countrymen, the&s;e coun|&s;els of an old and affectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the &s;trong and la&s;ting impre&s;|&s;ion I could wi&s;h; that they will control the u&s;ual current of the pa&s;&s;ions, or prevent our nation from running the cour&s;e which has hitherto marked the de&s;tiny of nations: But if I may even flatter my&s;elf, that they may be productive of &s;ome partial bene|fit, &s;ome occa&s;ional good; that they may now and then recur to moderate the fury of party &s;pirit, to warn again&s;t the mi&s;chiefs of foreign intrigue, to guard again&s;t the impo&s;tures of pretended patriot|i&s;m; this hope will be a full recompen&s;e for the &s;olicitude for your welfare, by which they have been dictated.</P>
<P>How far, in the di&s;charge of my official duties, I have been guided by the principles which have been delineated, the public records, and other evidences of my conduct, mu&s;t witne&s;s to you and to the world. To my&s;elf, the a&s;&s;urance of my own con&s;cience is, that I have at lea&s;t believed my&s;elf to be guided by them.</P>

<P>After deliberate examination, with the aid of the be&s;t lights I could obtain, I was well &s;atisfied that our country, under all the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, had a right to take, and was bound in duty and intere&s;t to take, a neutral po&s;ition.

<P>The inducements of intere&s;t for ob&s;erving that conduct will be be&s;t referred to your own reflec|tions and experience.
