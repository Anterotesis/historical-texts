</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE mourning of affectionate &s;urvivors for decea&s;ed friends, prevails among all kindreds and languages on earth without exception; it is co-ex|tended with death's unlimited &s;way, and will de&s;cend down through the unborn ages of all future time, 'till the univer&s;al conqueror &s;hall be &s;ubdued. The cu&s;tom is not blameable, but eminently laudable, as evincing a tender &s;u&s;ceptible di&s;po&s;ition which both Rea&s;on and Revelation approve.</P>
<P>THE mourning of States and Nations over con|&s;picuous merit departed, is likewi&s;e common and equally commendable. When tran&s;cendently u&s;eful characters are removed, the lo&s;s mu&s;t be &s;everely felt, and will be &s;incerely deplored. Let the lamentations of both kinds proceed even to an extreme&mdash;palliating circum&s;tances may induce us to commi&s;erate the extravagance as a pardonable weakne&s;s, rather than blame it as a criminal exce&s;s. Corre&s;ponding appearances of the impre&s;&s;ions made will be di&s;played,
<PB N="4" REF="036802_0003_100B10F999CD25F8">
lively evidences of them will be exhibited, on every &s;uitable occa&s;ion. Should the&s;e indications of inward di&s;tre&s;s al&s;o pa&s;s moderate bounds, &s;ympathetic &s;pec|tators will again find an adequate apology. Per&s;ons dear to us as our own &s;ouls are taken forever away. "The &s;urvivors die"&mdash;no te&s;timony of regard &s;eems too great to be&s;tow on their precious memories. With equal readine&s;s the heart and hand expand to atte&s;t our veneration for the father of his country, for the friend of mankind called from the land of the living. Superior attainments in religious excellence may give &s;ome an extraordinary &s;elf-command, which enables them to controul the u&s;ual tenderne&s;s of hu|manity, &s;o as to re&s;train expre&s;&s;ions of grief within &s;o|ber limits. Such acqui&s;itions will &s;hew their reality in an habitual cour&s;e of exemplary virtue; where this is wanting, and a &s;teady attention is paid to the dictates of cool deliberate &s;aving, under &s;ore bereavements&punc; we perceive not the energy of religious principle, but genuine proofs of an unfeeling and in&s;en&s;ible make. We do well then to imitate the conduct of the He|brews mentioned in the text, when a &s;imilar occur|rence brings it to our remembrance, and recommends it our adoption.</P>
<P>THE favorite of God and Man for whom they &s;orrowed, gave early pre&s;ages of future eminence, and 'till near the fortieth year of his life in which he fell, undeviatingly realized their fond expectations. It is no wonder if they wailed their irreparable lo&s;s in unu&s;ual &s;trains of woe. To mourn for him was made an ordinance in I&s;rael to be annually ob&s;erved,

a book of lamentations was compo&s;ed for the purpo&s;e. When any &s;ignal calamity befel them afterwards, they compared their di&s;tre&s;s to the mourning for Jo|&s;iah, as the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive repre&s;entation of its dread|ful extremity.&mdash;May no vengeful hand be permitted to renew the degree and extent of &s;orrow excited in our Nation by the melancholy event which we now commemorate.</P>
<P>IT has been ob&s;erved that the practice of man|kind in this re&s;pect re&s;ts on the be&s;t and &s;ounde&s;t-principles. Nature has implanted in our hearts ten|der pa&s;&s;ions, which mu&s;t therefore have objects adapt|ed to work upon them, and call forth their opera|tions. Without the la&s;t the fir&s;t would prove unne|ce&s;&s;ary and improper. Nor does religion condemn their exerci&s;e, or attempt to de&s;troy their exi&s;tence, but cheri&s;hes and improves them both by precept and example. Peru&s;e David's lamentation over Saul and Jonathan, whereby you will learn the &s;en&s;ibili|ties of a Hero and a Saint under the &s;ore pre&s;&s;ure of deep-felt &s;orrow. "Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew upon you, neither let there be rain upon you, nor fields of offerings.&mdash;The beauty of I&s;rael is &s;lain on the high places; how are the mighty fallen and the weapons of war peri&s;hed." Solomon tells us there is a time to weep and a time to mourn; but a greater than Solomon is here; Je&s;us wept; he wept at the death of a friend; he wept over the approaching ruin of Jeru&s;alem; his conduct ju&s;tifies the indulgence of private and public affections, per|mitting both to be rai&s;ed by &s;uitable occurrences&punc;
<PB N="6" REF="036802_0005_100B10FD983A2600">
While on earth he was a man of &s;orrows and acquaint|ed with grief. He died for &s;inners, and now exalt|ed to glory inconceivable, he is touched with the feeling of human infirmity. May we be effectually engaged to rely on Him as our only Saviour from the tyranny of &s;in, and the re&s;torer of our &s;piritual free|dom.</P>
<P>THE meditations we are engaged in further ad|moni&s;h us to enlarge our views, that we may realize the vanity of the &s;urrounding &s;cene, with relation to its pre&s;ent uncertainty and final con&s;ummation. Lo mighty Empires ri&s;e and fall! the power of one pa&s;&s;es to the hands of another; con&s;tant revolutions agitate our trembling a&s;toni&s;hed globe; multitudes are bu&s;i|ly employed in pulling down and in building up; myriads of human beings anxiou&s;ly contrive and ar|dently execute, according to the endle&s;s variety of parts a&s;&s;igned them, and the infinite diver&s;ity of &s;itu|ations in which they are placed. Soon will the num|berle&s;s actors fini&s;h the drama to make room for oth|ers, 'till the &s;tage be removed. A few years of rapid flight will lay the whole pre&s;ent generation low; their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors mu&s;t &s;hare the &s;ame fate, and ere long the end will come. De&s;olation ha&s;tens to overwhelm the mo&s;t fini&s;hed productions of nature, and the mo&s;t durable monuments of art. Our own much loved country, not long &s;ince the theatre of eager and un|certain &s;trife, where freedom's intrepid defenders con|tended valiantly in her cau&s;e, and e&s;tabli&s;hed her In|dependence, mu&s;t partake in the univer&s;al ruin and &s;ink into nothing. But what becomes of tho&s;e vir|tuous

patriots, who re&s;ented her wrongs, who vindi|cated her rights, and repelled ignominious &s;lavery from her affrighted &s;hores? Mu&s;t they peri&s;h in like manner, mu&s;t they be obliterated from the &s;cale of exi&s;tence, and extingui&s;hed in the common ma&s;s of de&s;truction? No&mdash;they awake from the repo&s;e of the grave, they ari&s;e out of their own ruins to live again.</P>
<P>WHILE we look forward with &s;olicitude to the di&s;&s;olution of the elements, and a triumphant re|&s;urrection, our proper bu&s;ine&s;s is to act our parts well, to perform faithfully the duties required in every progre&s;&s;ive &s;tage of our continuance, attending to the di&s;tinct calls and claims of each. The obli|gation of this hour directs us to examine more fully than we have yet done, the talents, the qualities and functions of our fir&s;t of citizens, who&s;e death has occa&s;ioned the pre&s;ent meeting, who&s;e death United America deplores, who&s;e death, I am almo&s;t tempted to add, a widowed world bewails.</P>
<P>WHEN we reflect on the number, ability and zeal of his admirers, on the time elap&s;ed &s;ince his re|moval, on the elegance, eloquence and &s;ublimity of eulogies con&s;ecrated to his memory, it may be pre|&s;umed that the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> is exhau&s;ted&mdash;but the theme is inexhau&s;table! And though a repetition of &s;ome things becomes unavoidable, it mu&s;t gratify us to join the univer&s;al voice by con&s;idering the &s;ubject in our own peculiar way, according to our previous conceptions of its nature and excellence.</P>

On that inglorious and di&s;graceful day GEORGE WASHINGTON acted as a volunteer aid to the Briti&s;h commander, and it is &s;aid he was the only officer on hor&s;eback who withdrew from the bloody field without a wound. More ex|po&s;ed than mo&s;t, braving danger with that fearle&s;s intrepidity which never for&s;ook him, no ho&s;tile wea|pon pro&s;pered, which aimed to injure or take away his life.

How prophetic a hope! how completely realized in the &s;e|quel! how &s;triking the interpo&s;ition of that Being, who can cover the warrior's head in the day of bat|tle!

The&s;e will inform you &s;ufficiently af|ter what manner he <HI>had</HI> conducted him&s;elf, and how perfectly the commencement of his effulgent day agreed with its progre&s;s and conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>IT is not nece&s;&s;ary to &s;pecify the &s;hare he after|wards bore in the then war, on retiring from which he formed a mo&s;t au&s;picious conjugal union, and pur&s;ued the dignified occupation of a farmer, im|proving a large e&s;tate with commendable indu&s;try and &s;ucce&s;s; fulfilling his engagements with punc|tilious honor; in&s;piring with uncommon re&s;pect every de&s;cription of citizens, avoiding o&s;tentation and pa|rade, but &s;upporting an elegant ho&s;pitality, and di&s;|playing a hand&s;ome &s;tile of living, &s;uited to the opu|lence of his circum&s;tances. In this interval like|wi&s;e, he accepted the tru&s;t of Delegate to the A&s;&s;em|bly of Virginia, and of Magi&s;trate on the Judiciary Bench of his county. How well he improved the opportunities thereby afforded him to under&s;tand ci|vil rights, and learn to re&s;pect them, fully &s;hone thro' his &s;ub&s;equent behavior on many tempting and trying occurrencies.</P>
<P>A CRISIS approached which brought him to act in a more con&s;picuous &s;phere. It became nece&s;&s;ary for the American people to a&s;&s;ert their privileges by an union of Councils, to denounce encroachments made on them, and expo&s;e certain ruinous principles adopted, which threatened their total &s;ubver&s;ion.

And it &s;o happened, without the exi&s;tence of any prejudice or partiality; without the di&s;crimination being de&s;igned, that native &s;ons of America were uni|ver&s;ally &s;elected on the great conjuncture. A review of the appointments revealed a remarkable fact, which I mention as truly honorable to the American cha|racter. Our future protector attended that augu&s;t a&s;&s;embly, inferior to none ever elected to tran&s;act our political concerns.</P>
<P>IT &s;oon appeared that a &s;harper weapon than the pen mu&s;t be employed&mdash;the &s;word was drawn, and entru&s;ted to the hands of GEORGE WASHING|TON, as commander in chief, by an unanimous vote of Congre&s;s, cordially &s;econded by the warm appro|bation of their con&s;tituents. Willingly would he have declined the commi&s;&s;ion, and preferred any other man who might be &s;uppo&s;ed qualified to fill the elevated and enviable office. No &s;uch man could be found&mdash;the &s;alvation of his country called on <HI>him</HI> to accept the high tru&s;t, and he obeyed the call. For a while his want of military experience was reckon|ed a di&s;advantage; other military characters were therefore looked to for &s;upplying the defect. The fallacy and folly of the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions &s;oon yielded under convincing evidences of the contrary, and he gradually ro&s;e to the &s;ummit of unbounded confi|dence. Civil authorities &s;eemed to depreciate; &s;u&s;|picion, di&s;tru&s;t and jealou&s;y threatened exten&s;ive mi&s;|chief

&mdash;but all believed in him as their bond of union and centre of &s;ecurity. While he lived and led our armies, we thought our&s;elves &s;afe, if our &s;afety under Providence, was to be accompli&s;hed. Severe rever&s;es tran&s;iently tarni&s;hed his glory; provoking di&s;ap|pointments deeply wounded the feelings of his manly brea&s;t&mdash;&s;till he bore up with unbending firmne&s;s. Accumulated di&s;a&s;ters and unparalleled trials could not &s;hake his confidence. Terror and con&s;ternation &s;eized the thou&s;ands of I&s;rael&mdash;yet he remained un|moved and immovable; never de&s;pairing, never de|pre&s;&s;ed, always prepared to improve every opportuni|ty and make the be&s;t of every &s;ituation. No dread of reproach, no impatience for the glare of momentary conque&s;t could tempt him to hazard the fate of his country, or relinqui&s;h tho&s;e prudent maxims which his enlightened judgment embraced and confided in for ultimate &s;ucce&s;s. How vigilant and di&s;cerning was he in chu&s;ing &s;uitable in&s;truments to retrieve or conduct affairs thro' the va&s;t, the extended variety of the ho&s;tile &s;cene? Who&s;e merits did he ever refu&s;e to appreciate; who&s;e glory did he attempt to dimin|i&s;h; at who&s;e prai&s;e did he &s;icken, tho' his own vo|luntary &s;acrifices and ma&s;terly arrangements laid the foundations of their fame? His mighty &s;oul di&s;dained emotions from the mo&s;t hateful, perhaps the mo&s;t general pa&s;&s;ion that di&s;graces human beings. View him at the head of an undi&s;ciplined mutable army, incompetently officered, &s;uffering intolerable hard|&s;hips from various &s;ources.&mdash;Ob&s;erve him &s;oothing refractory civil functionaries, uniting divided coun|cils, reconciling di&s;cordant intere&s;ts, conducting cor|re&s;pondencies,

who&s;e diver&s;ity, magnitude and per|plexity were &s;ufficient to engro&s;s the time and reflex|ions of an individual without other employment.&mdash; Con&s;ider him pre&s;&s;ed by all this huge weight of com|plicated bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;then a&s;k, what civility, written or verbal, did not he acknowledge? What attention did not he return, thro' the whole, even down to the inferior compliment of a common &s;alute? Such traits afford intelligent ob&s;ervers the cleare&s;t in&s;ight into the human character, and enable them to make a ju&s;t e&s;timate of its real worth. Great minds alone can attend to what is great and &s;mall in their proper place and connexion&mdash;which will not be permitted to make mutual encroachments, nor will the perform|ance of the one ab&s;orb a regard for the other.</P>
<P>WHEN our finally victorious and apparently ne|glected army were almo&s;t ready to revolt&mdash;when treated in their opinion with inju&s;tice and cruelty, &s;ome meditated redre&s;s by the terror of their arms&mdash; how tempting a pro&s;pect opened for an ambitious leader to gratify the feveri&s;h wi&s;hes of his heart, and &s;eize that prize for which &s;eas of blood have been often &s;hed? Without a pang of &s;u&s;pen&s;e or an in&s;tant of he&s;itation, this leader arre&s;ts the ri&s;ing &s;pirit with irre&s;i&s;tible deci&s;ion, quells the dangerous tumult, and re&s;tores a perfect calm. To the uninterrupted re&s;pect he paid the civil rights of mankind; to the venera|tion he invariably &s;hewed for the laws, together with-his farewell addre&s;s and &s;ub&s;equent per&s;onal deport|ment, we may without offence a&s;cribe in part a pecu|liar characteri&s;tic in that highly and ju&s;tly celebrated

<P>IT is not an article in the creed of a Republican or of a Chri&s;tian, that the &s;afety of a country de|pends on the life and actions of any one man. This was acknowledged here during the continuance of our Revolutionary War; at the &s;ame time it was ar|dently prayed&mdash;it became the prayer of America, that we might not be put to the trial of carrying on that war under the direction of any other command|er. The &s;upplication met a gracious hearing.&mdash;Un|der his au&s;pices the important conte&s;t concluded in &s;plendor and pro&s;perity; Independence re&s;ted on a &s;olid ba&s;is; our nation took rank among Thrones and Dominions under the &s;un, and he retired to his farm covered with glory, followed by the &s;incere ap|plau&s;es of grateful and admiring millions.</P>
<P>HIS native State, wi&s;hing to expre&s;s the lively &s;en&s;e they entertained of his tran&s;cendent worth and mag|nificent atchievments, came forward with an offer in the mo&s;t delicate manner, which he might have ac|cepted without impeaching his reputation in the &s;malle&s;t degree. Subordinate commanders accepted &s;imilar compliments for inferior performances, nor did or could the lea&s;t imputation attach to their ac|ceptance, in any re&s;pect. Had he complied with the propo&s;al, not the only one made, it would have been followed by others of the &s;ame kind; it would have grown into fa&s;hion; we &s;hould have beheld rival

&mdash;the de&s;ire of it is called their la&s;t infirmity. Weak and unfortunate rulers may have been driven into ob&s;curity by weakne&s;s or misfortune&mdash;but "to de&s;cend voluntarily from the &s;upreme to a &s;ubordi|nate &s;tation, and to relinqui&s;h the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of power in order to attain the enjoyment of happine&s;s, &s;eems to be an effort too great for the human mind." Such is the beautiful reflexion of Dr. <HI>Robert&s;on,</HI> when mentioning the Abdication of <HI>Diocletian</HI> and <HI>Charles</HI> the 5th. However great the effort is, it has been di&s;|played before our eyes under circum&s;tances rendering it peculiarly &s;triking and extraordinary. The abdi|cating Emperors had already "impaired their con&s;ti|tutions, and brought on the infirmities of old age." The retiring Pre&s;ident retained the full health and &s;trength, the vigor and activity of a &s;trong body and &s;ound mind, equal to the functions of his elevation, and fitted to reli&s;h the fa&s;cinating charms of his grandeur. But the&s;e were not the motives for his con&s;enting to appear at the head of a mighty nation&punc; When his country could &s;pare his agency, no induce|ment remained with him to continue in her &s;ervice, and he re&s;olved once more, "to pa&s;s the remainder of his days in honorable repo&s;e, and place his glory beyond the reach of fortune."</P>
<P>But will he again put all to ri&s;que, if that coun|try's &s;afety requires it? Will he relinqui&s;h beloved retirement in declining years, to encounter the vici&s;|&s;itudes of doubtful war?

inflexible patrioti&s;m. Thro' the whole of his diver|sified career the applau&s;es of his fellow citizens were beyond parallel. Wherever he went, acclamations accompanied him; glowing addre&s;&s;es poured on him from every quarter. Nothing is more likely to in|toxicate the firme&s;t mind, making it inattentive to the frailty and mutability of humanity. A&s;&s;ailed by the&s;e, and knowing he was the theme of exuber|ant prai&s;e in many different lands, his moderation and equanimity pre&s;erved their influence undimini&s;hed, unimpaired&mdash;no a&s;&s;uming airs of con&s;equence, no di&s;plays of &s;elf-importance, no indications of in&s;o|lence marked a &s;ingle word of his mouth, or action of his life. With what humility did he piou&s;ly ac|knowledge the interpo&s;ition of Providence at proper &s;ea&s;ons, and recommend a reliance on Almighty God for national ble&s;&s;ings&mdash;How anxious was he to re|cogni&s;e co-operation and a&s;&s;i&s;tance in tran&s;actions where he might have claimed exclu&s;ive merit? Af|ter pa&s;&s;ing thro' a &s;cene of &s;o much celebrity, what old acquaintance did he forget; of what former friend was he a&s;hamed; who&s;e &s;ociety did he de|cline, among circles that knew him and were known by him previous to the era of his &s;eductive elevation? This is Republican, in his life you have&mdash;in his life you had, a living lecture on Re|publicani&s;m&mdash;with heart-felt exultation I add that, he died in the Republican &s;aith.</P>

His character, in public and in private, is &s;tain|ed by no vice, disfigured by no vain affectation, no di&s;gu&s;ting peculiarity or pitiable weakne&s;s, which have repeatedly deba&s;ed the mo&s;t exalted names. At the feat of his re&s;idence you trace the order and regularity of a camp without its rigor, di&s;covering the &s;ound clear under&s;tanding which will &s;hew it&s;elf in every walk.

Were I obliged to de&s;ignate the mo&s;t prominent feature in his rich portrait, perhaps my opinion would &s;elect the talent di&s;played by his writings. De&s;titute as he was of a learned education, and untrained in &s;tudies favorable to the exerci&s;e of the pen, his literary productions, are of them&s;elves &s;ufficient to &s;ecure for their author an everla&s;ting me|morial.</P>
