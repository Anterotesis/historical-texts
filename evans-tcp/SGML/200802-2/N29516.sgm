<P>THough my Lot be fallen in a Scribling Contentious Age, which makes many things of weight and substance slight|ed, (which was ready to deter me from wri|ting) yet I find it my Duty, according to my capacity, to detect Falshoods and Slanders covered with a profession of Truth, of which sort, the Book of Certificates published by <HI>John Pennington,</HI> is plentifully stored.

<P>But to the Certificates my intent is to speak, &amp; chiefly to that sent from a Monthly Meeting at <HI>Burlington</HI> the 6t. 6 m. 1694. which compre|hends most of the rest, I shall first show how it was obtained (as I had it as well from some that signed it, as from others which refused to sign it) and <HI>next,</HI> I shall sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">w how it is stuft full of Lyes and Slanders, that the impartial <HI>Reader</HI> may see how they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ly to Lyes for a <HI>Refuge,</HI> and to Slan|ders for <HI>Revenge.</HI></P>
<P>When News came from <HI>England</HI> that <HI>S. Jenings</HI> was beset in <HI>London,</HI> by reason of his &amp; his Bre|threns Actions at <HI>Philadelphia</HI> coming out in print, <HI>Ann,</HI> the Wife of S. J. made application <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to some Members of <HI>Chesterfield</HI> Meeting, &amp; obtained a Certificate to relieve her Husband in that distress, for which I blame her not. Then <HI>J. Wilsford</HI> and <HI>Fr. Devonport,</HI> two of that Mee|ting, came to the Meeting at <HI>Burlington,</HI> to pro|pogate the business there. And having framed a Certificate, it was read in the Meeting, and some readily signed it, but some others, (more willing to see with their own Eyes) made some scruple; and one or two, it seems, questioned the truth of what was written about <HI>D. Leeds,</HI> which scruple <HI>Fr. Devonport</HI> took off, by saying, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> he had heard</HI> D.

They answered, <HI>They had not defamed me, nor wrote any untruth of me.</HI> To which I replyed, <HI>If you have not wronged me, I hope you will be the more willing to do me justice, in granting me a Copy; I'll pay for the writing of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> &amp;c.

I went again next Meeting, but no Copy&punc; could I obtain, &amp; <HI>J. Wilsford</HI> gave me an answer in these words, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> G.

<P>But the Certificate being printed in <HI>England,</HI> as aforesaid, and returned to <HI>America</HI> having missed the hands of <HI>S.

<P>Now I demand of these Enemies of <HI>P. Boss,</HI> to show wherein his Life and Conversation is so reproachful: Is he a Blasphemer, or Thief, or Knave, or Whoremonger, or Adulterer? Is he a Drunkard, an Extortioner, a Lascivious or a Proud Person? Nay, is he a quarrelsom or ill Neighbour? Next time you print pray be so just as to tell us, and the world wherein his Con|versation is so reproachful. But herein you manifest <HI>(to the judicious)</HI> your Spirit of Pre|judice and Revenge; for (it seems) 'tis sufficient for you to call a man <HI>wicked,</HI> and <HI>of a reproachful Life,</HI> and leave it to others to show wherein he is so. We are informed, and that by one of your own Friends of the Ministry, which came lately out of <HI>England, That</HI> S.

<P>The next thing in course is about <HI>S. J</HI>'s riding a Horse-race with <HI>J. Slocum,</HI> and being drunk. Now, this <HI>I</HI> say, I do not believe <HI>S.

<P>And as to <HI>S. Jenings</HI> surveying of <HI>R. Matthews</HI> Meadow, his answer to it, in Book, called, <HI>state of the case, &amp;c.</HI> he has both abused me and his own knowledge, in calling what I evidenced, <HI>An idle story,</HI> and yet neither does not can say, the story is not true; and how can that which is true, be idle? for the substance of what I de|clare upon my Attestation, is, <HI>That he surveyed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"></HI> (by <HI>Simon Charles</HI>) which is not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, but owned by him; in short, the judi|cious Reader may easily see, that <HI>S.

to <HI>S. J.</HI> himself, That suppose the survey of his own Meadow (which lies off from his Planta|tion too) were by a mistake or neglect (in the Recorder) wrong or short recorded, whether he would not count it unjust in any that should take that advantage to take away his Meadow, and thereby ruin his Plantation? Here lies the plain honesty of the case.</P>
<P>And whereas <HI>S. J.</HI> tells <HI>Elias Far,</HI> in his Letter printed with the Certificates, <HI>That all the M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a|dow was not pretended to be for</HI> Matthews. But I say, that's a mistake, at least, in <HI>S. J.</HI> for there was no more Meadow in that place, but what was surveyed and recorded to <HI>Matthews</HI> seven years before, which Meadow terminated in a small run of water at the lower and, where grew some Bushes, and there's a markt Tree or two still to be seen, only the Bushes being burnt root and branch, it shews like Meadow further; but the number of Acres would have determined the matter, which was to be 25. our Law allow|ing so much to 500 Acres of Land. And this was all that was wanting in the wording the survey, which if that had been, (which it seems was by some means omitted) the survey had been per|fect. And therefore if it be printed over never so often, <HI>Sam. Jenings</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to blame for medling with that Meadow, especially the Owner being absent, and also, inasmuch as I told him how the case stood, shewed him the Meadow, and also a Copy of the Record, when he was about to survey said Meadow, and would have dis|swaded

him from it, as he knows. But to re|turn to the matter.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Burlington</HI> Certificate they tell of a Warrant they have by them, insinuating as if <HI>J. Skeen</HI> took a course at Law with <HI>S. Jenings,</HI> for saying, <HI>Thou pitiful Whip jack, I despise thee;</HI> for that is the thing cited in the Book of the Tryals, pag. 30. which we say is false; and therefore if they look again, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> find it their mistake, nay, a sly in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">ation to make the World believe that <HI>J. S.</HI> took a course at Law <HI>S. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> for calling him <HI>Ill Names.</HI> We grant there was a Warrant written, but 'twas about their difference concerning the Road to <HI>Burling|ton,</HI> when they were stop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, and there had like to have been Mischief done; and I heard the Warrant was never executed; but this was for Actions and Threats, as being <HI>Unhorsed,</HI> and the like, and it was not <HI>J. Skeen,</HI> but his Wife that complained, being filled with fear of Mischief, <HI>S. Jenings</HI> having ordered his Son and Servants to stop any of <HI>J. Skeens</HI> family coming that way, (and that he himself would Unhorse them, if he met him, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR><HI>J. S</HI>) and had endeavoured it with Forks, &amp;c. and broke the Bottles of Rum that J. S'<HI>s</HI> Son was carrying to the Reapers: &amp; 'tis to be noted also, That some of that Meeting were greatly dissatisfied with <HI>S. Jenings</HI> beha|viour in that affair, and resolved to bring it up in the Meeting, before S. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. removed to <HI>Phila|delphia;</HI> but when the time came, his greatness was such as they had not courage to do it. But
<PB N="17" REF="039315_0016_10141D6BC57FB700">
to say, their <HI>differences</HI> were quickly ended, is but daubing; for I know that at the next Monthly Meeting after J. S'<HI>s</HI> Death some of S. J'<HI>s</HI> Friends were for putting the matter on against the Widdow, and <HI>I</HI> well remember one in the Meeting answered, <HI>Let the Widdow alone, poor Women, she <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ath Exercise enough for the loss of her husband;</HI> and so that matter was no more meddled with. And if they mean it was quick|ly ended, because it could be continued no longer, by&punc; reason of J. S's Death, I suppose they are in the right.</P>
<P>And whereas they tell of <HI>Henry Beck</HI> and and <HI>J. Smith,</HI> two of the Evidences, getting young Women with Child, they ought also to have been just to these men, and let the world know that the Young Women were their espoused Wives, that they got with Child: They still are wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ting in that excellent Virtue which they say <HI>S. Jenings</HI> hath, <HI>To be just to all men;</HI> for they have not been just to these two, but do, as much as in them lies, to defame well-meaning men, and render them Odious: what though they were overtaken with that Infirmity in their Youth, must they therefore be render|ed to the World in print, as unfit for Evidences, when neither the Law of God nor Man does now condemn them: Surely if <HI>Sam. Jenings be j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">st to all men,</HI> as they say, needs no such Rubbish to defend him.</P>
<P>Again, they say of <HI>J. Bainbridge, That he has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a Drunkard, Fighter, Quarreller, Rude and
<PB N="18" REF="039315_0017_10141D4977AC1340">
Wicked.</HI> I say, I know not but the Man has been so; and if he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e mended now, does that offend them? pray which of us have not been wicked in one respect or other? but it seems their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|ness is not encourage men in turning from evil, but to render them Odious for the evil they have done: O! what a woful case are we in, if God should deal so by us! Now <HI>Jo.

<P>Then as what is said of <HI>James Silver,</HI> in the Certificate they declare, that he said, <HI>it was ex|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ed from him,</HI> (meaning his Evidence in the Book of the Tryals) <HI>never thinking it should be put in print.</HI> Those last words, <HI>(never thinking it should be put in print,</HI> he owns he said, but says, <HI>the other is false, he never said it was ex|torted from him;</HI> for he says, <HI>That when they asked him concerning the Truth of what he declared, hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> answer was, Ay, it is all true, and a great deal more; but he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> not think when he spoke it, that it should have been printed, he was sorry for that.</HI> And that it is true that he gave them that ans|wer, the best Friend of mine going by the House of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. G.</HI> in <HI>Burlington,</HI> heard him speak the same words to those that were interrogating him, who told i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to me the same day; and therefore I am fully perswaded of that being another <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; also, I believe the man knew

not the meaning of the word <HI>extort.</HI> And altho' <HI>Benj. Moore</HI> calls it a great Lye in that <HI>Ja. Silver</HI> says, <HI>hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Master</HI> Jenings <HI>took him by the Throat,</HI> yet to my knowledge <HI>Benjamin</HI> himself has for|merly declared such like words, as that <HI>his Ma|ster griped him by the Coll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r,</HI> and other Com|plaints he has made, which I have met with at Neighbours Houses. But one thing I observed, which in the defence of <HI>Ja. Silver</HI> I shall relate, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That on a time when <HI>S Jenings</HI> was going to <HI>England,</HI> the said B. M. came to his House to make up some Accounts with him, or the like, and I saw S J. give his old Servant <HI>Benjamin</HI> a very good Leather Garment or two, and 'tis observable, that <HI>B. Moore</HI> never after that hath been heard to give his Master a hard word, for which I do not blame him; but truly when men say and unsay, and so make mischief among their Neighbours, I judge them to blame for that; for <HI>I</HI> take it to be an argument of be|ing void of Conscience.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> I find among the Certificates, That <HI>Benj. More,</HI> jun. charges <HI>Joh. Silver</HI> and <HI>J. Smith</HI> of stealing Oats, Powder, Shot, Wool, Eggs, and the like; but I leave them to answer for themselves, that are defamed, by it; for I judge it a <HI>Defamation,</HI> if true, because 'tis divulged many years out of time; and tho' it be like the bundles of stuff in the rest of the Certificates, yet <HI>I</HI> should be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> any man should have the like advantage against me, as they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ave against the said B.

I had potent partial Friends, but 'tis enough for me to have such Enemies.</P>
<P>By this time I hope my old Friends will no more judge others for making up bundles of stuff, and raking up Dirt; for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> they do, they certainly condemn themselves, as much as ever men did, as he that reads impartially must ac|knowledge.

<P>WEre it not but that I know how to spend my precious Time better, could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a vo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lumn to shew the Per|versions and Falshoods of <HI>Sam Jenings, Thomas Elwood</HI> and <HI>J. Penington,</HI> in their late Pamphlets against <HI>G. Ke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">th, &amp;c.</HI> but there being some Reply made to the two first by <HI>G. K.</HI> and the above short answer to the latter, I shall at pre|sent only detect two or three Falshoods in <HI>S. J</HI>'s book, called, <HI>The state of the case, &amp;c.</HI> and so conclude.</P>
<P>In the first place I observe, that both <HI>Sam. Jenings, Thomas Elwood</HI> and <HI>John Penington</HI> being hard beset to clear their Friends from the Errors charged and proved against them, they endeavour to invalidate the Evidences of honest men, S. J. p. 7. says, <HI>These two Witnesses were muc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> at the Devotion of</HI> G. R. <HI>&amp; his creatures to use as he pleased</HI> Which I charge upon <HI>Sam. Jenings</HI> as a wicked Lye, and demand of him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> shew wherein these two Witnesses, were, <HI>G. K</HI>'s Creatures, to used as he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="039315_0021_10141D5175017D10">
In the next place I find his Brother <HI>Elwood</HI> to follow his steps, and in his book called, <HI>A further discovery,</HI> p. 25. says, <HI>Those 2 Witnesses, who were both known to be strong in party with</HI> G. K. <HI>and great Adversaries to</HI> W. S. But I would ask T. E. now he knows they were strong in party with G. K.? and wherein it appeared they were great Adversaries to <HI>W. S.?</HI> Had there then been any difference, controversie or party taking, where|by these Witnesses had shown themselves <HI>strong on party</HI> with G. K. and <HI>great Adversaries to W. Stockdale?</HI> I say, Nay, and T. E. has therein uttered a great Falshood. And I advise him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> time to have more ground for what he asserts than S. J. bare say-so. But this way I find they take to discredit G. K's evidences: its a new trick they have found out (and, <HI>true or false,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e believed b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">some) for nothing was a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">edged against them at the time they gave evidence, but on the contrary <HI>T. Loyd</HI> said then, of one of them, <HI>he might be counted among the Elders, &amp;c.</HI> But he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with the stream, his Veracity now must be questioned concerning what he did evi|dence four years ago.</P>
<P>They having thus endeavoured by Lyes and Falshoods to discredit G. K'<HI>s</HI> evidences, let's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> how S. J. multiplyes the Evidences against G. K. <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR><HI>T. Fitzwater</HI> having charged G. K. with <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the sufficiency of the Light,</HI> he brings only <HI>W. Stockdale</HI> as an evidence to prove it, but <HI>Sam. Jenings</HI> in his <HI>state of the case,</HI> p. 3. says, <HI>T. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> brought <HI>W. Stockdale</HI> &amp; <HI>W. Meaning</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="039315_0022_10141D747301D0C8">
to evidence to the truth of his charge. But as we know <HI>T. F.</HI> never pretended to bring <HI>W. Meaning</HI> as an evidence, so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> is there any such person in these parts, therefore forgery in S. J. to make two where there's but one.</P>
<P>Then again, whereas G. K. had occasionally related how S. J. in a Monthly Meeting called one of his fellew Members <HI>Non-sensical Puppy,</HI> to wipe off this, he says, p. 41. when he met with it in print, he made e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">quiry, &amp; heard it was spoken by one <HI>T. Tress, an odd sort of a singular man, &amp;c.</HI> But here it may be observed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> S. J. is not just in this Relation, for it was not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>T. Tress,</HI> but <HI>R. Ward</HI> also, that did then, and do now evidence to the truth thereof. But I suppose S J. thought it best to mention but one evidence, that the matter related against him, might seem the more probable to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. So where only <HI>One</HI> Evidence is brought against G. K. he'll forge another to make up two, that the charge against G. K. may seem true, as p. 3. but where <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">wo</HI> evidences are against himself, he'll relate only <HI>One</HI> of them, to make the charge seem not true, see p. 41. Behold, ye Signers of <HI>Chesterfield</HI> Certificate, this is him ye call your <HI>well-beloved Friend, who was just to all men!</HI> will ye say he is just in this matter be|fore related? I suppose not. Well might he be ashamed to let his Book go publick <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> abroad, here in <HI>America,</HI> where so many knew it to be made up chiefly of <HI>Lyes, Perversions</HI> &amp; <HI>Forgeries,</HI> and therefore it was great Policy in him to keep
<PB N="24" REF="039315_0023_10141D53F1A20248">
his books up, and, not let one of them be seen by those that were abused therein. But now they are come to hand another way, &amp; his Clan|destine way of spreading them is to no purpose. And it now lies upon him to vindicate his said book, and make a just Reply to G. K's Answer to him: Some of the Persons abused by his Book, have demanded a publick Conference, where they offer to detect his Falshoods; but this I find he evades.</P>
<P>There is one passage more which I cannot well pass by without detecting the notorious Fals|hood thereof, and that is in pag. 24. of <HI>S. J.</HI>'s Book, where he insinuates, That G. K. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his hearers by telling them <HI>of a preaching Quaker in</HI> Maryland, <HI>That got another mans Wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e with Child, which they could not discern by the Light within: and of another being carried out of a Ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">-house drunk.</HI> I shall say no more in answer to these, but that we charge them on S. J. as noto|rious Falshoods, and de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ie the whole world to make good that ever G. K. uttered such expres|sions in his Preaching. And S.
