<HEAD>REASONS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>AS &s;ome religious per&s;ons may mi&s;conceive the rea&s;ons which prevent Friends from freely centributing (when called upon) to the ex|pences of the Methodi&s;t mi&s;&s;ions, to the We&s;t-In|dia I&s;lands and Africa, to in&s;truct the Negroes in Chri&s;tianity; I have been induced to point out &s;o many of them, for their information, as may, I hope, convince impartial minds, that they are not therein actuated by a &s;pirit of bigotry; but, on the contrary, of religious caution, le&s;t they &s;hould any way contribute to <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gal.</HI> ii.18.</NOTE> build again tho&s;e things which the Spirit of truth has de|&s;troyed in their religious &s;ociety.</P>
<P>There remains no doubt, that many of the preachers among&s;t the Methodi&s;ts have been in|&s;trumental to rou&s;e &s;inful men from their beds of ea&s;e, and convince them of the danger of their &s;tate, and of the impo&s;&s;ibility of their at|taining &s;alvation, even through the mediation of Chri&s;t, unle&s;s they are renewed up in hm, thro' the purifying operation of his Holy Spirit, in righteou&s;ne&s;s and inward holine&s;s.</P>
<P>So far as this awakening work has advanced, and its con&s;equent fruits of renovation of mind and manners have been produced, the truly re|ligious among Friends have rejoiced therein; and have united in &s;pirit with their con&s;cientious la|bors,
<PB N="4" REF="046546_0003_102203BCB427D650">&s;o far as they have mini&s;tered in the abi|lity which flows from Chri&s;t, the holy Head of his own Church; as well as with the really re|formed members of the Society, who act agreea|bly to the light wherewith they have been favor|ed, and are concerned to attain a perfect know|ledge of their duty, and experience of &s;alvation.</P>
<P>For <HI>the&s;e,</HI> Friends de&s;ire that they may witne&s;s an entire and &s;teady &s;ettlement under the govern|ment of God's pure Spirit, which is the alone infallible teacher and leader, appointed of Chri&s;t to be &s;o unto the end of time. To him all in|&s;trumental mini&s;ters &s;hould direct tho&s;e minds they have been a&s;&s;i&s;ted to awaken, that they may know him to <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> xvi.13.</NOTE> "guide them into all truth," con&s;onant with the promi&s;e of Chri&s;t, who, by this his own pure Spirit, is with his di&s;ciples and followers in their re&s;pective &s;tati|ons and &s;ervices, <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Matt.</HI> xxviii.20.</NOTE> "alway, even unto the end of the world;" bringing all his edifying &s;ayings to their remembrance, as their &s;piritual &s;tates require them, either for reproof, in&s;truction, or con&s;olation; and opening their under&s;tandings into his holy doctrines, and the glorious my&s;|tery of redemption through him, from unrigh|teou&s;ne&s;s, that they may become purified unto God, <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Titus</HI> ii.14.</NOTE> "a peculiar people, zealous of good works."</P>
<P>But, whereas it appears to Friends, that &s;ome of the principal leaders among the Methodi&s;ts,

For out of all the&s;e did the divine Spirit of Truth, lead their zealous and pious predece&s;&s;ors, in their beginning as a people; and it does &s;till convince the truly enlightened among them, that, in&s;tead of e&s;tabli&s;hing the mind in the holy fear of God, and in a &s;teady depend|ance upon him, they tend to deprive him, in part, of the honor of his own glorious work in the &s;oul, by leading to a degree of reliance up|on the <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gal.</HI> iv 9.</NOTE> "weak and beggarly elements" for a&s;&s;i&s;tance to perfect them in righteou&s;ne&s;s, and on <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> i.25.</NOTE> "the creature more than the Creator, who is God, ble&s;&s;ed for ever, Amen," &s;ay the &s;ouls who humbly wait upon him, and witne&s;s his Son revealed in them by his Spirit, to be their King, Prie&s;t, and Prophet; their <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rev.</HI> i.11.</NOTE> "Al|pha and Omega;" the beginner and ender of his own glorious work of &s;anctification, by whom they are wa&s;hed with the <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Titus</HI> iii.5.</NOTE> "wa&s;hing of rege|neration, and renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t;" and their &s;ouls are fed with the bread of life, and refre&s;hed with the new wine of his heavenly kingdom.</P>
<P>The&s;e, &s;eeing that the end is come upon the &s;ha|dowy di&s;pen&s;ations of the Mo&s;aic Law, and of John the Bapti&s;t, can no longer touch nor ta&s;te with

But the in&s;truction from God was, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well plea&s;ed, hear ye him." Thus the Father conde&s;cended, immediately, to te&s;tify to his own la&s;t and mo&s;t glorious di&s;pen&s;ation of grace and truth, thro' his Son to mankind, appointing him their in|fallible and free teacher; not then leaving it to him&s;elf to te&s;tify to his own office, although <NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Col.</HI> ii.9.</NOTE> "in him dwelleth all the fullne&s;s of the God|head bodily."</P>
<P>Under a &s;en&s;e of the awfulne&s;s of this merci|ful manife&s;tation of the will of the Father, my mind is humbled; and de&s;ires are rai&s;ed, that the Son, through his own pure Spirit of light and life, may in&s;truct and invigorate awakened
<PB N="7" REF="046546_0006_102203C0351F4DE0">minds, to the perfecting them in true holine&s;s of faith and practice.</P>
<P>When men &s;et bounds to this holy Spirit of wi&s;dom, and endeavor to fix the people in the ob&s;ervance of what them&s;elves acknowledge to be non-e&s;&s;entials, Friends cannot unite with them herein; becau&s;e in Chri&s;t's church nothing can remain by his appointment, which is inefficacious.</P>
<P>All that is of human appointment, or which is retained of the former di&s;pen&s;ations, mu&s;t be come out of: and let human rea&s;oning &s;upport, as it may for a time, the u&s;ele&s;s ceremonies which remain in the nominal Chri&s;tian Church; the true light will di&s;cover them to be but chaff, from which Chri&s;t will purge <HI>his own</HI> &s;piritual Church. Therefore, religious minds &s;hould be|ware how they hold fa&s;t or &s;upport that which he hath appointed to be denied, as being under his pure &s;piritual di&s;pen&s;ation unclean <HI>unto them,</HI> and not to be touched.</P>
<P>Friends have been in&s;tructed, that Chri&s;t as the holy, living, wi&s;e <HI>Head of his Church,</HI> hath the &s;ole power and right to purify, qualify, call, &s;end forth, direct and a&s;&s;i&s;t his mini&s;ters; who, by the immediate operation of his Spirit upon their &s;pirits, are made in their re&s;pective mea|&s;ures <NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Cor.</HI> iii.6.7.</NOTE> "able mini&s;ters of the New Te&s;ta|ment, not of the letter which killeth, but of the Spirit which giveth life."

<P>Now as Friends have believed in, and expe|rienced this pure &s;piritual mini&s;try and wor&s;hip, and have been commanded to te&s;tify again&s;t its contrary; and for obedience to God therein have <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The Sufferings of Friends, in two volumes, by J. Be&s;&s;e, and their Hi&s;tory by W. Sewel.</HI></NOTE> &s;uffered much; they cannot unite with the human appointments in the Methodi&s;t Soci|ety,
<PB N="9" REF="046546_0008_102203C22EFACB60">whereby their mini&s;ters are directed how and when to preach and pray, where to go, and among what people to labor, any more than with the human wi&s;dom, which &s;eeks qualifica|tions to mini&s;ter from human learning, and or|dination from men. They acknowledge that hu|man learning may be made u&s;eful under Divine direction; but they know that he who cho&s;e and qualified poor illiterate fi&s;hermen, &amp;c. to preach his go&s;pel <NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> ii.4.</NOTE> "in the demon&s;tration of the Spi|rit, and of power," <HI>is able to do &s;o &s;till.</HI> And if he call the&s;e who have not &s;chool learning into hi&s; &s;ervice, 'tis not for them to &s;eek there|by to be perfected therein.</P>
<P>They have believed that mini&s;ters &s;hould not, in any degree, be excited to engage in the mi|ni&s;try by a view to worldly intere&s;t or honor; and that Chri&s;t's command to <HI>his</HI> mini&s;ters is yet in force, <NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Matt.</HI> x.8.</NOTE> "Freely ye have received, free|ly give;" therefore, they appoint no mainte|nance for their mini&s;ters, nor contribute there|to, otherwi&s;e than when they are engaged in go&s;pel labors, to afford them &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary ac|commodation, as they may be free to accept; or, if they are poor, and cannot provide for them&s;elves and families, mini&s;ter to their wants, as they maintain their other poor. Many mini|&s;ters among them, labor with their hands to pro|vide for their nece&s;&s;ities; and others, accounting it more honorable to give than to receive (as
<PB N="10" REF="046546_0009_102203B09329DA70">did the primitive go&s;pel mini&s;ters) do give libe|rally to their poor brethren in their various &s;ta|tions, and to other charitable purpo&s;es, as well as expend much in the cour&s;e of their labors, in the exerci&s;e of their mini&s;try.</P>
<P>From the foregoing premi&s;es it mu&s;t appear, that Friends cannot, con&s;i&s;tently with ther own principles, freely unite with the leaders of the Methodi&s;t Society, who e&s;tabli&s;h all the rites and ceremonies of the Church of England, and the maintenance of its mini&s;ters by tythes; the pay|ment whereof, the truly con&s;cientious among Friends cannot &s;ubmit to; becau&s;e tho&s;e being a part of the Levitical law, are ended in Chri&s;t, as is the ob&s;ervance of all the ceremonies of that di&s;pen&s;ation, which were but a <NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Heb.</HI> x.1.</NOTE> "type (or figure) of the&s;e good (being purely &s;piritual) things which were to come," and have been re|vealed and experienced under Chri&s;t's di&s;pen&s;ati|on of light and life.</P>
<P>They lament, that the reformation from the apo&s;tatized Romi&s;h Church, which has made &s;ome progre&s;s in this nation, did not go forward to the full accompli&s;hment thereof, although ma|ny laid down their lives to effect it, &s;o far as they had &s;een; and are, doubtle&s;s, numbered with the glorified &s;pirits perfected through &s;ufferings.&mdash; Some of the&s;e faithful martyrs te&s;tified again&s;t things which yet remain in the Church of Eng|land, and which its mini&s;ters &s;eek to uphold; but which mu&s;t be de&s;troyed when Chri&s;t by his

<P>Now having, in a mind clothed with charity to|wards all truly religious per&s;ons, who&s;e under|&s;tandings may not be &s;o fully opened, as to &s;ee the end of all which &s;hould be aboli&s;hed in the nominal Chri&s;tian Church, penned the foregoing rea&s;ons: I proceed to &s;tate a few Queries con&s;o|nant therewith, and tending to di&s;cover whether &s;ome ob&s;ervances, approved and practi&s;ed by &s;ome of the mi&s;&s;ionaries &s;ent among the poor Ne|groes, may not tend to fix their dependance up|on what cannot profit them; and may confu&s;e their weak judgments, rather than e&s;tabli&s;h them in the pure &s;piritual faith in Chri&s;t, and in the exerci&s;e of a wor&s;hip con&s;i&s;tent therewith.</P>
<P>And <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Suppo&s;ing the&s;e poor ignorant people, through preaching the doctrines of &s;a|cred &s;cripture, have been taught that it is ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to their &s;alvation, that they &s;hould experience a change of nature; for whereas man is a fallen creature, and as &s;uch, is by nature of the <NOTE N="(v)" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xv.47.</NOTE> "earth earthy," and hath de&s;ires and inclinations agreeable to his de|praved earthly &s;tate, and hath brought forth the condemnable fruits of the fle&s;h; he mu&s;t be hea|venly

Now, if through the mer|cy of God, a degree of living faith has been rai&s;ed in the power of Chri&s;t, as the head of, and alone &s;anctifier and perfecter of the mem|bers of his body or Church; can it avail any thing to &s;prinkle a little water in their faces, and cro&s;s their foreheads with the finger, u&s;ing the cu&s;tomary words in the performance of that ce|remony, and thanking God for their <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Bapti&s;m&mdash;Church of England Service.</HI></NOTE> regenera|tion, &amp;c. If the Negroes reflect, what can they think of being thus admitted into the commu|nion of the Church?

<P>Secondly, How can the Negroes conceive, that by eating a bit of bread, and &s;upping a little wine, they really participate &s;piritually of the body and blood of Chri&s;t? The utmo&s;t that can be inferred from the words of Chri&s;t to his di&s;|ciples (as recited in Luke xxii.19 &amp; 20, at the pa&s;&s;over, when he ble&s;&s;ed and break the bread, and handed it as he did the cup to them, as the &s;ign of his body and blood being offered up for them) is, that "they did it in remembrance of him, and thereby &s;hewed forth his death till he came." And although to a truly religious per&s;on, who con&s;cientiou&s;ly ob&s;erves this cere|mony, merely as a remembrance of him, there may a degree of &s;olemnity attend, under the con&s;ideration of his &s;ufferings, and the merciful end of his coming; I will venture to a&s;&s;ert, that his body and blood is not &s;piritually conveyed by the admini&s;tering material bread and wine; nor does the communion of the &s;aints &s;tand in any degree therein: nor is it nece&s;&s;ary thereby to revive the remembrance of Chri&s;t in tho&s;e &s;ouls, who have experienced his &s;econd coming unto their &s;alvation from &s;in; for the&s;e &s;anctify him in their hearts, and feed upon him, the liv|ing eternal word of God, with whom they have &s;weet communion; and many of them &s;ee clear|ly the non-nece&s;&s;ity of continuing this (as the Church of England &s;tiles it) <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Church of England Catechi&s;m.</HI></NOTE> "outward &s;ign

With|out breach of charity this may be concluded to be the ca&s;e of many, who partake of the outward bread and wine; for they are too unclean to ap|proach Chri&s;t's holy table, or to ta&s;te of his &s;up|per, &s;piritually.</P>
<P>Thirdly, In regard to the outward mode of wor&s;hip, &s;ome of the principal leaders among the Methodi&s;ts direct their followers to attend that of the Church of England; and what can the Ne|groes think, when they &s;ee the mini&s;ter put on a white robe to read prayers in, and a <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>William Fulk, that Engli&s;h champion of the Prote&s;tants in the time of Queen Elizabeth, writes, "The Prie&s;ts of Baal had the name of Chemarims for their black garments, which they did wear &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly." See Zeph.</HI> i.4. <HI>which Anthony Purver, in his tran&s;lation of the Old Te&s;tament, makes "Black ones." The critics have allowed Purver to be a literal, tho' in &s;ome in&s;tances an inelegant tran&s;&s;ator; but I think, whoever reads him with attention will admit, that in many parts, the &s;en&s;e of &s;cripture is conveyed much more clear|ly, than in the common tran&s;lation.</HI></NOTE> black one

What is meant by the&s;e changes of garments and attitudes in prayer, by tho&s;e who ob&s;erve them, I know not; but &s;u&s;pect both to be retained from the heathens, as the prie&s;ts of Baal were wont to be clothed in black, and the Romans prayed towards the ea&s;t; probably becau&s;e there the &s;un aro&s;e, as other pagans (particularly the Per&s;ians) wor&s;hipped to|wards the ri&s;ing &s;un.
