<P>KNOW YE NOT THAT THERE IS A PRINCE AND A GREAT MAN FALLEN THIS DAY IN ISRAEL!</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WHY, my brethren, are we a&s;&s;embled together? Why do I &s;ee your countenances &s;ad, and your garb the garb of mourning? Why are our fel|low-citizens throughout the United States, a&s;&s;embled in their various towns, this day? Yea, why are the free born &s;ons of America, from New-Hamp&s;hire to Georgia, this day in mourning? Ah! why? Is our country invaded by a ho&s;tile foe, threatening imme|diate de&s;truction? No. Does famine prevail, and ex|cite the people to &s;upplicate the favour of God? No. Does the pe&s;tilence walk through our &s;treets and cau&s;e groan to an&s;wer groan, and &s;pread de&s;olation through all our towns? No. The rea&s;on is this, <HI>A great man has fallen</HI> in America. Your beloved WASHING|TON is no more. Yes: WASHINGTON, the great, the wi&s;e, the humane, the father of his country and the benefactor of man, has fallen into the icy arms of death. This, you are &s;en&s;ible, is the cau&s;e which has a&s;&s;embled us together: This is the rea&s;on why all United America this day mourns.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="037182_0005_100CE3B3C14ED6C0"><HI>KNOW YE NOT THERE IS A GREAT MAN FALLEN IN ISRAEL!</HI></P>
<P>WASHINGTON was truly <HI>great.</HI> When difficul|ties aro&s;e between America and her mother country, our &s;ituation &s;eemed pitiable. Our country was in|vaded by a nation accu&s;tomed to war, a nation fur|ni&s;hed with able generals and a well di&s;ciplined army, a nation powerful in arms. But we were in an in|fant &s;tate, unprepared and comparatively weak. Our re&s;ources were &s;mall and our citizens were unlearned in the art of war. Con&s;idering, however, that our li|berty and property were at &s;take, the free born &s;ons of America awoke: They left the plow for the &s;word: They left their hou&s;es, their families, their wives and cildren in the hands of providence, and ha&s;tened away to face the enemy.</P>
<P>THOUGH, perhaps, we wanted not for lovers of our country and men of courage; yet we wanted experi|enced commanders, and di&s;cipline in our troops. Why were we not overcome? The Lord was on our &s;ide. Soon we were provided with able generals and di&s;|ciplined &s;oldiers. Under the good providence of God, our &s;trength increa&s;ed, and our little band became of &s;ome con&s;equence.</P>
<P>EARLY in the war the name of WASHINGTON re&s;ounded. The greatne&s;s of his mind began to &s;hine. His wi&s;dom, prudence and valour became con&s;picuous. Soon he was rai&s;ed to the &s;upreme command of our armies. He was the very man we wanted: the very man that providence de&s;igned for &s;ignal &s;ervice to his country. He accepted the po&s;t a&s;&s;igned him, and was
<PB N="7" REF="037182_0006_100CE3B5CAF023F0">
unwearied in his attention to his army. Far from o&s;tentatiou<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> or haughtine&s;s, he was plain and conde|&s;cending in his deportment. They who were under his command were u&s;ed with that lenity and humanity as convinced them that their General was their friend. How beloved was he by his &s;oldiers! Were he in danger a thou&s;and &s;words would leap from their &s;cab|bards to defend their beloved chief.</P>
<P>HIS prudence directed him when to avoid the ene|my; he had wi&s;dom to contrive his operations in the field, in the be&s;t manner; and his courage never fail|ed him in executing his plans, when the good of his country called. He was neither <HI>rash</HI> nor <HI>cowardly.</HI> Always calm, &s;teady and re&s;olute, he carried his points, with unexpected &s;ucce&s;s. His army, knowing his wi&s;dom, prudence and courage, were willing to fol|low him wherever he led.</P>
<P>SUCH was the power of the enemy, and &s;uch were the di&s;advantages under which we laboured, that our army had to encounter many di&s;couragements, and to pa&s;s through many adver&s;e &s;cenes. But the greatne&s;s of WASHINGTON's mind was able to overcome di&s;|couragements. If the army began to de&s;pond, the pre&s;ence of WASHINGTON in&s;pired every &s;oul with animation. If ob&s;tacles pre&s;ented, and in&s;tilled faint|ne&s;s into their minds, their WASHINGTON was at their head, and by his example and direction taught them to &s;urmount the ob&s;tacles. In adver&s;e &s;cenes he was like the rock in the ocean, unmoved by da&s;h|ing waves. His mind was too great to de&s;pair. He knew how to bear adver&s;ity. Neither did pro&s;perity intoxicate his mind &s;o as to tempt him to lay a&s;ide
<PB N="8" REF="037182_0007_100CE3B7E860C6D8">
his wonted circum&s;pection. In pro&s;perity and adver|&s;ity he was the &s;ame, calm, firm, re&s;olute and vigi|lant. He continued to act the part of wi&s;dom and courage till at length, with the aid of his brave &s;ol|diers and fellow-citizens, together with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a foreign ally, he gained the final victory: a vic|tory, humbling indeed to the enemy: a victory which brought freedom and independence to our country. Hail! au&s;picious day! a day when liberty was en|&s;ured to brave Americans.</P>
<P>O America, long maye&s;t thou retain that indepen|dence for which thy &s;ons have bravely fought. And long maye&s;t thou remember him who headed thine armies to the field of battle, and led them forth to victory: Yes; long maye&s;t thou remember the name of WASHINGTON.</P>
<P>PEACE being happily &s;ettled, WASHINGTON, unambitious, did not attempt to lord it over his bre|thren; but mode&s;tly retired to live the life of a private citizen.</P>
<P>HIS country, however, did not long &s;uffer him to ta&s;te the &s;weets of retired life.&mdash;When they who were cho&s;en to frame a new and energetic con&s;titution for their country, were a&s;&s;embled. WASHINGTON was among them, and was the man to pre&s;ide over their deliberations. After an energetic tho' liberal con&s;titution was framed and adopted, a man was want|ed to hold the executive power. Americans, tho' by this time con&s;iderably numerous, and &s;cattered over a va&s;t tract of country; yet <HI>all</HI> with one voice exclaim WASHINGTON, <HI>none</HI> but WASHINGTON! The A|merican
<PB N="9" REF="037182_0008_100CE3BB2E980638">
Hero again obeyed his country's call and was inve&s;ted with the office of pre&s;ident of United America. This office he executed with wi&s;dom and firmne&s;s, and to the general acceptance of his country|men. He was not influened by fear or flattery, to loo&s;e &s;ight of his duty to his country. When the term for which he was cho&s;en expired, his country <HI>repeated</HI> the call, and he <HI>again</HI> obeyed his country's voice.&mdash;At length he re&s;olved again to retire to the life of a private citizen. Not long, however, had he thus lived till difficulties aro&s;e, and it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to rai&s;e new troops, and put the country in po&s;ture of defence. But who &s;hould be the man to take the charge of our troops? Who, but WASH|INGTON? The <HI>brave Veteran</HI> again was called, and he <HI>even again</HI> accepted. He was con&s;equently inve&s;ted with the office of Lieut. General of the armies of United America: and this was the la&s;t office he &s;u&s;tained in the &s;ervice of his country.</P>
<P>FROM the manner in which he fulfilled the duties of his &s;everal &s;tations, WASHINGTON's <HI>greatness</HI> appeared.&mdash;</P>
<P>HE was <HI>great</HI> in <HI>abilities.</HI></P>
<P>No doubt, the God of nature endowed him with <HI>great</HI> native &s;trength and penetration of mind. Con|&s;idering the multiplicity of bu&s;ine&s;s which devolved upon his hands, and the active &s;ervice of his country, in which he was continually kept, his <HI>acquired</HI> abilities were al&s;o great, greater, perhaps, than would have been the acquirements of almo&s;t any other man under like embarra&s;&s;ments. In his writings his acquired a|bilities
<PB N="10" REF="037182_0009_100CE3BCC6F357B8">
&s;hine with lu&s;tre. His compo&s;itions have been generally acknowledged to contain ideas which are noble and ju&s;t. His &s;tile was elegant, unaffected, conci&s;e and comprehen&s;ive. He ea&s;ily conveyed his ideas in language which was directly to the point, without o&s;tentation and circumlocution. When we view him in the field or the cabinet, in war or in peace, or in whatever &s;tation he held, we mu&s;t be con|vinced that he was a man <HI>great</HI> in abilities.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON was <HI>great</HI> in <HI>integrity.</HI> This was manife&s;t through the whole of his life. Never have we heard of a treacherous act which he hath perform|ed to his country. Great indeed and almo&s;t unlimit|ed was the confidence which was placed in him; and he did not abu&s;e the confidence. When we con&s;i|der his great fore&s;ight and his unbounded influence in the army, together with the confidence placed in him by the government, we may well &s;uppo&s;e that if he had undertaken to betray his country, incalculable would have been our misfortunes. If WASHINGTON had been a traitor, where had been our liberty, our lives and property? But far be it from us to &s;uppo&s;e that ever a treacherous idea entered his mind. When others proved traitors, <HI>he</HI> was the &s;tedfa&s;t pillar not to be &s;haken. His integrity&punc; was &s;o undi&s;puted that it has become proverbial not only in America, but Europe and the nations of the world.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON was a <HI>great</HI> lover of his country. Who will di&s;pute this, when his whole life declared it? From his youth to his death was he not in the &s;ervice of his country? Was he not faithful in this &s;ervice? Was he not exceedingly active, firm and re&s;olute in
<PB N="11" REF="037182_0010_100CE3BE6C8AC560">
his country's cau&s;e? Has he not ever &s;acrificed his private ea&s;e to the public welfare? Did he ever re|fu&s;e when his country called? No dangers, no ri&s;k of reputation, no dome&s;tic enjoyments, could keep him from boldly &s;tepping forth to &s;erve the publick. We have no rea&s;on to doubt but that the love of his coun|try reigned in his heart, and the public good fired his &s;oul to action.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON manife&s;ted a &s;en&s;e of the divine exi&s;tence and of God's Government over nations and in|dividuals&mdash;a &s;en&s;e of human dependence and men's ob|ligations to acknowledge God's hand in all their con|cerns&mdash;a &s;en&s;e of the importance of the Chri&s;tian re|ligion, in order for nations to be pro&s;pered and indi|viduals to be happy.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON was a man of morality. We ne|ver heard of him practi&s;ing that profanene&s;s too com|mon in the army. We never heard of him from the gaming table. We never heard of him engorging the intoxicating draught. No. He was a man of temperance&mdash;a man of exemplary deportment&mdash;a man of morality. This was his general character. I know not that his morality was ever que&s;tioned.</P>
<P>HE was a man of dignity. Though he was not haughty and o&s;tentation; yet he maintained his dig|nity. He was mode&s;t and conde&s;cending, but far from all meanne&s;s. I know not that an unmanly act ever &s;tained his character.</P>
<P>HE was a man of per&s;everance. Whatever he un|dertook, he was accu&s;tomed to accompli&s;h. Cold,
<PB N="12" REF="037182_0011_100CE3C009117110">
hunger, thir&s;t, fatigue, difficulties, or dangers, did not ea&s;ily break him off from pur&s;uing his plans to effect.</P>
<P>HE was a man <HI>great</HI> in the e&s;teem and affection of his countrymen. As he loved his country, &s;o his country loved him in return. His countrymen were not blind to his merits: They knew&mdash;they e&s;teemed &mdash;they <HI>felt</HI> his worth. They looked to him as their deliverer&mdash;they loved him as their friend. That he &s;hared largely in the e&s;teem and affection of his coun|try, is proved by the tran&s;actions of this day. Look around on this a&s;&s;embly. Is not this numerous a&s;|&s;embly a witne&s;s that WASHINGTON was beloved. Look further: Look to the towns around us, where the people are this day a&s;&s;embled. Yea, ca&s;t your eyes over the whole of the&s;e United States. See the citizens from north to &s;outh, a&s;&s;embled in various places. For what purpo&s;e is this, but to te&s;tify their e&s;teem&mdash;their affection for their friend, and to mourn for the lo&s;s of their WASHINGTON.</P>
<P>THUS I have mentioned &s;ome traits of the charac|ter of him who&s;e lo&s;s we mourn, not becau&s;e they were unknown, but to remind you that he was <HI>great.</HI></P>
<P>BUT as great as he was, he was but a man. He was but a frail, mortal man like others. <HI>Know ye not that a great man is fallen in Israel?</HI> A great man is fallen in America. Yes: the wi&s;e, the brave, the beloved WASHINGTON, has fallen a prey to death. He who remained unhurt in the field of battle, where the blood of the &s;lain ran around&mdash;he who &s;tood un|moved at the lightening of the &s;pear and the cannon's roar&mdash;he is now no more&mdash;no more in this world.
<PB N="13" REF="037182_0012_100CE3C33388BFC0">
No more can we receive his aid and hear his councils. <HI>He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.</HI> His vigorous arm has lo&s;t its &s;trength: his robu&s;t con&s;titution could not &s;tand before the king of terrors. His eyes are for e|ver clo&s;ed, his mouth is &s;ealed in &s;olemn &s;ilence, and his once active limbs, now remain without life or motion. Before his death, much reliance, under God, was placed upon his wi&s;dom and experience, in ca&s;e our country &s;hould again be involved in war. But our expectations of his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, are &s;uddenly vani&s;h|ed. No more is he to mar&s;hall our troops and lead our armies to victory. The mighty conqueror is conquered by the all-conquering power of death.</P>
<P>DESCEND, my countrymen, to the lonely tomb&mdash; Open the door, har&s;hly grating on its hinges, look a|round the &s;olemn apartment, <HI>there</HI> you will find your friend&mdash;your benefactor&mdash;your father&mdash;your WASH|INGTON. <HI>There</HI> he lies to moulder to his primeval du&s;t.</P>
<P>OH! <HI>How is the mighty fallen,</HI> and the man <HI>of war perished!</HI></P>
<P>BUT is there nothing left of WASHINGTON, but lifele&s;s clay? There is more indeed. He lives in the affectionate remembrance of a grateful people, and his name will be handed down, with applau&s;e, to ge|nerations yet unborn. Many of his writings, which contain his parental advice to his country, are yet pre&s;erved. Long may they be pre&s;erved and &s;trictly regarded.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="037182_0013_100CD68A05EDD668">YEA, more; his &s;oul&mdash;his noble part, &s;till lives&mdash; This has entered another world to exi&s;t forever, and we humbly hope has joined the happy choir above in a&s;cribing rapturous prai&s;e to the Power Divine.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;O WASHINGTON!&mdash;</L>
<L>"Altho' in &s;olemn &s;ilence laid,</L>
<L>"Among the pale and &s;leeping dead,</L>
<L>"Where neither breeze nor genial ray</L>
<L>"Pervades the cold encircling clay:</L>
<L>"Yet&mdash;thy name &s;hall &s;weetly &s;ound,</L>
<L>"While yonder circling &s;un goes round,</L>
<L>"Each generous eye its tribute give&mdash;</L>
<L>"And tho' thou art dead, thy fame &s;hall live."</L></Q>
<P>How ought we, my hearers, to improve the death of this <HI>great</HI> man, who&s;e lo&s;s we mourn. It is im|portant that we not only &s;how our re&s;pect for the de|cea&s;ed by our publick a&s;&s;embly, but that each of us be improved by the providence of God.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;tly. Let the death of WASHINGTON remind us that it is God who gives and takes away ble&s;&s;ings. All our favours are derived from him who is the giver of every good and perfect gift. It is true that he who&s;e death we mourn has been a ble&s;&s;ing to Ame|rica; yet we ought to adore the giver and not the gift. The Lord was the giver, the man the gift. Let us look to the giver and acknowlege the good pro|vidence of God in be&s;towing upon us the able <HI>General</HI> &mdash;the wi&s;e <HI>Statesman</HI>&mdash;the great <HI>Patriot.</HI> God rai&s;ed him up as an in&s;trument in his hand to perform what he performed. He rai&s;ed him up for important purpo&s;es to his country and to mankind. The&s;e pur|po&s;es
<PB N="15" REF="037182_0014_100CE3C4D230D088">
are an&s;wered. Therefore let us ble&s;s the Lord that he rai&s;ed up WASHINGTON for our country's good. Ble&s;s the Lord that he protected the man in all dangers of an eventful war&mdash;that <HI>he</HI> enabled him to &s;erve his country with wi&s;dom and fidelity. Be thankful that the Governour of the world continued him &s;o long an eminent ble&s;&s;ing to America and to man|kind. In&s;tead of giving too much glory to the <HI>man,</HI> give the glory to God.&mdash;From God he received his talents: To God we owe the prai&s;e. When he had done the work which God a&s;&s;igned him, and arrived to the bounds which God had &s;et to his life, he was taken away. The Lord had nothing more for him to do, and therefore continued him no longer in the world. As it is God who hath taken him from us, let us &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider the hand of God. Infinite <HI>wisdom</HI> directs the wheels of providence. God is actuated by <HI>goodness</HI> in every providence. Therefore it is altoge|ther for the <HI>best</HI> that WASHINGTON is dead.&mdash;As God is mo&s;t <HI>wise</HI> and <HI>good,</HI> &s;o it is rea&s;onable that men be &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to <HI>his</HI> will and rejoice that <HI>he</HI> reigns. Had we been to choo&s;e concerning our decea&s;ed friend, we &s;hould have wi&s;hed his continuance in the world; but for &s;ome rea&s;on his continuance was not for the be&s;t. Let us realize the hand of God in this in&s;tance of mortality, and be ready to &s;ay, <HI>The Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away, and blessed be the name of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2dly. LET the death of WASHINGTON teach us humility. God's providence is ju&s;t. We are a &s;inful people. We de&s;erve the heavy judgments of God.&mdash; Great are our national privileges, and we have de&s;erved that they &s;hould be taken from us.&mdash;God would be
<PB N="16" REF="037182_0015_100CE3C75964DAC0">
ju&s;t if he &s;hould take from us our wi&s;e men and leave us to loo&s;e our liberties and privileges. Let us &s;ee our ill-de&s;ert, acknowledge our wanderings from God, and humble our&s;elves under the mighty hand of the Lord.&mdash;</P>
<P N="3">3dly. LET the death of WASHINGTON remind us that all mu&s;t die. Death is the appointment of heaven. <HI>It is appointed unto all men once to die.</HI> Job knew that the grave is the hou&s;e appointed for all the living.</P>
<P>MAN is of a frail and dying nature: He is not calculated to remain long in the pre&s;ent &s;tate. The period will &s;oon come when <HI>The keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow them|selves, and the grinders cease because they are few, and those that look out of the windowe be darkened</HI>&mdash; the period when <HI>The dust shall return to the earth as it was, and the spirit shall return to God who gave it.</HI></P>
<P>MEN die to make room for others. So it is with all things: They move in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The bea&s;ts of the field, the fouls of the air and the fi&s;h of the &s;ea, leave the world and are followed by others of their kind. So it is in the vegetable world. The old tree falls and is &s;ucceeded by new ones. In autumn the fore&s;t is de&s;poiled of its foliage; the &s;pring returns, and the fore&s;t is again clothed in green.</P>
<P>That all mu&s;t die, we may know by ob&s;ervation. How many thou&s;ands have lived to former days? Tho' once bu&s;y on this &s;tage of action, they are now laid in mouldering du&s;t. Where are the mighty
<PB N="17" REF="037182_0016_100CE3C997918220">
Generals, the admired Heroes and the Legi&s;lators of ancient times? Tho' they were accounted as Gods; yet they have died like men, and lie on a level with others. How many &s;ince our day have left the &s;hores of time! How often are we called to attend the funerals of our friends and aquaintance, and to lay them in the narrow hou&s;e? One falls on our right and another on our left, and are committed to their native du&s;t.</P>
<P>A MAN's riches cannot bribe the king of terrors, nor can his poverty plead in his behalf. The rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared &s;umptuou&s;ly every day, died and was buried. The beggar who lay at his gate full of &s;ores, fell a prey to death.</P>
<P>A MAN's friends cannot extend the bounds of life. <HI>No man can redeem himself or his brother.</HI> The dying look to their friends, and affecting is the &s;cene, their friends are unable to relieve.</P>
<P>PHYSICIANS are called around the bed of death, but death baffles their &s;kill. They are made u&s;e of as in&s;truments to pre&s;erve life untill men arrive to the bounds which God hath &s;et, then all their means are in vain.</P>
<P>A MAN's u&s;efulne&s;s &s;aves him not. There are many men who by their councils, their exertions and examples are of great &s;ervice to the world. But even the&s;e mu&s;t be called from their u&s;efulne&s;s.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Worthy Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU are &s;en&s;ible that WASHINGTON was a ma|&s;onic brother. And as he &s;u&s;tained an eminent office in the lodge, &s;o it is evident that ma&s;onry received no &s;mall &s;hare of his attention. Is ma&s;onry then "fri|volous?" Was WASHINGTON a man of dignity e|very where el&s;e, and a child in the lodge? Is ma&s;on|ry calculated to make men thir&s;t for licentious liberty and di&s;organization? Has not WASHINGTON &s;pent his life in the &s;upport of order and good government? Has he not manife&s;ted his regard to the Chri&s;tian re|ligion and morality? Would he approve and &s;upport the ma&s;onic in&s;titution in ca&s;e it were incon&s;i&s;tent with good government, order, religion and morality? No&mdash;the character of WASHINGTON was uniform and con&s;i&s;tent. But you already know the nature of ma|&s;onry. It is &s;uch as WASHINGTON was not a&s;ham|ed to approve. But no more will he meet with his brethren in this world&mdash;no more will he &s;upport them&mdash;no more will he give them his wi&s;e in&s;truc|tions and his parental advice&mdash;no more will he a&s;&s;i&s;t in rai&s;ing the fallen, and no more will his noble &s;oul aid his brethren in alleviating the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the

unfortunate. For he has bid adieu to the &s;ociety of mortals.</P>
<P>No doubt you feel the lo&s;s: for in his death you have lo&s;t a great benefactor, a noble friend, and a worthy brother. Since he is gone, let us remember that it is the Lord's doing and acquie&s;ce in the bereaving providence. Since he has travelled through the jour|ney of life, to return no more, let it be remembered that we al&s;o are travelling to that country from who&s;e bourne no traveller returns. Soon the thread of our life will be &s;evered by the &s;cythe of time. Soon the &s;ands of our gla&s;s will be run out, and we mu&s;t fol|low the decea&s;ed brother to the grave, where all are level.</P>
<P>SUFFER me then to urge you to live as travellers to another world. Entertain &s;upreme affection to the Great I Am: reverence the name of Jehovah: tru&s;t in the Lord; and travel by the unerring light of God's holy word. If you do this, you will be &s;afely conducted through the wilderne&s;s of this world&mdash;your feet will be guided in the path of holine&s;s and peace. If you do this, you will hold the balance of ju&s;tice in equal poize, walk by the plumb line of uprightne&s;s, be re&s;trained within the compa&s;s of duty, &s;quare your actions by the rules of equity, and bring forth the fruits of Chri&s;tian benevolence. Cultivate a &s;pirit of friend&s;hip and humanity, after the example of that &s;incere friend and humane brother who&s;e death you mourn. After his example al&s;o be lovers of your country, &s;upporters of its con&s;titution, engaged in fa|vour of order and good government, and never weari|ed in promoting the publick weal.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured Sirs,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>As WASHINGTON was once eminent in the civil department, &s;o you may well feel his lo&s;s. No more will our civil affairs be directed by him. But let it be remembered that our civil affairs are in the hands of God, and he is able to a&s;&s;i&s;t others to &s;erve their country with fidelity in the civil office. Much of our country's welfare, depends, under God, upon the civil authority. Unle&s;s the civil authority be faithful to their tru&s;t and vigilant in &s;eeing that the laws are obeyed, our laws will be, in a great mea&s;ure, in vain&mdash; our liberty will be abu&s;ed and degenerated into &s;ad licentiou&s;ne&s;s&mdash;yea our religion will mourn and vice will triumph. If therefore our laws be worthy of notice&mdash;if our rights and liberties be worth pre&s;erv|ing, and if religion be of any importance in regard to
<PB N="24" REF="037182_0023_100CE3D8D4DDC430">
our country's welfare or to our eternal peace, much depends on the civil authority. It is through the good providence of God that we have gained our li|berties: this has been done, however, with arduous &s;truggles and at the expence of the blood of many a brave American. We have now order, peace and good laws e&s;tabli&s;hed&mdash;yea, we enjoy our religion un|mole&s;ted&mdash;we may &s;et under our own vines and fig-trees without any to make us afraid. Is it not im|portant then for us to hold our liberty precious, to obey our laws and revere our religion? Without re|ligion there can be no <HI>good</HI> civil government&mdash;with|out the <HI>form</HI> of religion <HI>none</HI> will long remain.</P>
<P>To you, my fathers, we look as guardians of our rights, defenders of our laws, and &s;upporters of our re|ligion. Though I pretend not to much knowledge in civil affairs, and though I would not pre&s;ume to di|rect you in your office; yet, permit me humbly to &s;ugge&s;t the importance that our laws be duly ob&s;erv|ed re&s;pecting morality and the Chri&s;tian &s;abbath. I need not enlarge on the importance of morality and the &s;abbath: you feel their importance. They are important if we look to the good of our government, the good of our nation, the good of our&s;elves, or the good of our children. And who &s;hall watch over us and puni&s;h the immoral pe&s;t of &s;ociety and the di&s;|turbing &s;abbath breaker, if not our civil magi&s;trates? The civil magi&s;trate acts for God and is accountable to him. <HI>The powers that are, are ordained of God.</HI> Good <HI>Rulers are not a terror to good works but to evil.</HI> How important is it then that the civil ma|gi&s;trate be firm and &s;tedfa&s;t in the di&s;charge of his tru&s;t. WASHINGTON was un&s;haken, when execut|ing
<PB N="25" REF="037182_0024_100CE3DB4403F828">
the laws of his country. Long may we have ma|gi&s;trates wi&s;e and firm like WASHINGTON. Long may we have them, who &s;hall be a terror to evil do|ers, and a prai&s;e to them who do well. Long may we have them, who &s;hall hold &s;acred our rights and liberties&mdash;our laws and our religion. Long may we have them in office, who love our country like WASHINGTON, who are fearers of God, and faithful in the di&s;charge of their duty.</P>
<P>MY fathers, may the Lord be with you, and &s;anctify to you the death of him who&s;e lo&s;s you mourn; may God grant you wi&s;dom and a&s;&s;i&s;tance in your impor|tant &s;tation, and long continue you rich ble&s;&s;ings to your fellow-citizens and promoters of your country's welfare.</P>

<P>No man in America nor perhaps in the world has been as famous as WASHINGTON for his military talents. During the greate&s;t part of our revolutionary war, he held the fir&s;t military office, and executed it in &s;uch a ma&s;terly manner as to gain the applause of his country, and the wonder of the world. Such was his wi&s;dom as to baffle the skill and the art of the enemy who were commanded by the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t experienced generals, of whom England had to boa&s;t. Such was his bravery in the field, as cau&s;ed proud Britons to flee before him. Such was his authority, that his inferior officers and &s;oldiers obeyed him with promptitude, and &s;uch was his mildne&s;s and conde&s;cention that they loved and revered him. So irreproachable was his character as a general, that I
<PB N="26" REF="037182_0025_100CD685E87C8468">
know not that even his mo&s;t inveterate enemies dared to utter a &s;yllable derogatory to his military character. He &s;ilenced the voice of envy and &s;truck dumb the tongue of calumny. How did you rejoice&mdash;how did his &s;oldiers rejoice&mdash;how did all America rejoice, when the brave Veteran accepted his la&s;t appointment to take the charge of our new rai&s;ed troops. But Oh! &s;ad rever&s;e! He has re&s;igned his commi&s;&s;ion. No more do you look to him as your leader. He has pa&s;&s;|ed the vale, whence there is no returning. In him you have lo&s;t your military chief&mdash;your wonderful hero.&mdash;In his death the &s;oldiers have lo&s;t their military father, their friend and general. Should America, perchance, be again involved in war, and &s;hould any of you be called to the field of battle, would you not wi&s;h to &s;ee your WASHINGTON at your head? But you will &s;ee him not. No more will the enemy fear him &mdash;no more will you follow him to face the enemy. <HI>More</HI> then is to be done by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. Let me exhort you to follow the example of WASHINGTON in your military office. If ever you &s;hould be called to defend your country, think how <HI>he</HI> would have con|ducted and do likewi&s;e. If you have wi&s;dom like him your arrangements will be good and probably &s;ucceed. If you have dignity and authority like him, your &s;ol|diers will re&s;pect and obey you. If you have humani|ty and lenity like him, they will love you as their friend. If you have prudence like him the enemy will &s;carcely gain an advantage. If you have bravery like him, you may expect a glorious victory.&mdash;But may God avert the calamity of war from our country: may he forbid that you &s;hould ever have occa&s;ion to enter the field of battle. May you never have occa&s;ion to go thro' the dangers, thro' which WASHINGTON has
<PB N="27" REF="037182_0026_100CE3DF391309C8">
gone.&mdash;&s;hould, however, the din of war be heard in our land, and &s;hould the good of your country call you to battle, &s;hrink not from the undertaking. Rally round your country's &s;tandard, ha&s;te away to meet the enemy and bravely defend your rights and liberties, your lives and property, your wives and children. Let the love of liberty, the love of your country, the love of your families, fire your &s;ouls to action. Remember WASHINGTON: What he did was honourable.</P>
<P>LOOK to the God of war, make your peace with him, engage him on your &s;ide, and you will have no|thing to fear. <HI>If God be for us, who can be against us?</HI> May the Lord give you his ble&s;&s;ing: may he continue peace in our land and pro&s;perity in our dwellings, &s;o that you may long ta&s;te the &s;weets of retired life, and thro' life enjoy dome&s;tic happine&s;s; may God enable you to fight the good fight of faith, war the Chri&s;tian warfare with &s;ucce&s;s, and when time is no more be&s;tow upon you a crown of joy as the re|ward of &s;piritual victory.</P>

<P>WASHINGTON was once a private citizen. Yea, he rejoiced in being a citizen of the free and indepen|dent &s;tates of America. Whenever his country would give con&s;ent, he retired to the life of a private citizen. In this character he did honour to his country.&mdash;As a citizen he was obedient to the laws of our land and a &s;upporter of the government under which we live. In private life, he was attentive to husbandry and do|me&s;tic

concerns: He was tender and affectionate to his family, kind and obliging to his friends and forgiv|ing to his enemies.</P>
<P>BUT America no more calls him her citizen. He has become the citizen of another country. As his death is our lo&s;s as citizens, &s;o we may with propriety notice the mournful event. It is important that we al&s;o be &s;uitably improved by it.</P>
<P>LET us candidly attend to WASHINGTON's in|&s;tructions and regard his councils, for he was our friend. Let us pray the Father of mercies, that his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in office may be enabled to &s;erve their coun|try with that wi&s;dom and fidelity as <HI>he</HI> hath done. Our publick affairs are in the hands of God, and it is important that we &s;upplicate his favour to our national concerns. And let us pay a &s;trict regard to the laws of the land in which we live. <HI>Let every soul be subject to the higher powers: for there is no power but of God: the powers that be, are ordained of God.</HI></P>
<P>BY this in&s;tance of mortality, which has called us together, let us be reminded of the vanity of all things below the &s;un.&mdash;Nothing on earth is permanent: One generation goeth, and another cometh. Be reminded of the in&s;ufficiency of all things here below, to make us truly happy. Since this world is vanity, <HI>Set your affections on things above, not on things on the earth.</HI> Of what value now is this world to WASHINGTON. None indeed. "How lov'd, how valued once, avails him not." Let us then lay up trea&s;ure in heaven, where is genuine happine&s;s and durable joy.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="037182_0028_100CE3E46A8C8460">SINCE WASHINGTON is dead, let us reflect on our own mortality. Death knocks equally at the doors of palaces and cottages.

<P>Our time is &s;hort. Day after day and year after year, roll almo&s;t imperceptibly away, and carry us onward to the clo&s;e of life. If we live even to old age, we &s;hall find the time to be &s;hort. While time is pa&s;&s;ing it is apt to &s;eem long: hours often hang heavily upon us, and we drag the tedious load of life. But time when pa&s;t appears &s;hort indeed. When an old man looks back on his pa&s;t life, it appears like a dream, or in the expre&s;&s;ive language of in&s;piration, <HI>Like the morning cloud and the early dew which soon passeth away.</HI>&mdash;What are &s;ixty or eighty years, when compared with the lives of the Patriarchs, who lived eight or nine hundred years?&mdash;What are they, when compared with the time elap&s;ed &s;ince the days of Adam, which is about &s;ix thou&s;and years? Or what are the&s;e &s;ixty or eighty years, when compared with eternity! Eternity, va&s;t boundle&s;s eternity, will never end. Oh! let us realize the &s;hortne&s;s of our time!</P>
<P>IF the lives of the old be &s;hort, how much &s;horter &s;till are the lives of many others! It is computed by &s;ome, that one third of the human race die under the

age of one year, and nearly one half under the age of five years. Many are cut off in the vigour of life and in the bloom of youth.&mdash;How few&mdash;how very few live till old age! The frailty of human nature is proved by daily experience.</P>
<P>IT appears that WASHINGTON, a few days before his death, was robu&s;t and healthy; but how &s;oon is he laid pale and lifele&s;s! Oh! how precarious are all things here below! Why&mdash;why will we not realize the uncertainty of our lives?</P>
<P>Is our time &s;hort, and are our lives uncertain? then let us not mi&s;pend our time. Why &s;hould we trifle it away? Why &s;hould we not think of our danger before death &s;tares us in the face? Why will we &s;ail quietly down the rapid &s;tream of life till we be unex|pectedly launched forth into the boundle&s;s ocean of eternity?</P>
<P>Is WASHINGTON no more? then let us be ex|cited to prepare to die. Preparation for death is the great end of life.
