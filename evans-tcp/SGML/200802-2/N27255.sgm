<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THREE years have now almo&s;t elap&s;ed &s;ince I publi&s;hed an account of the experi|ment made with the nitrous fumigation on board the Union ho&s;pital &s;hip, and of the &s;imilar trials made at the &s;ame time on board &s;ome &s;hips of the Ru&s;&s;ian &s;quadron.</P>
<P>The accurate and candid narrative of this bu&s;ine&s;s, given by tho&s;e gentlemen, who undertook the conducting it, proved in the cleare&s;t and mo&s;t unequivocal manner, to every unbia&s;&s;ed mind, not only the power of the nitrous vapour in de&s;troying contagion, but the &s;afety with which it might be em|ployed: &s;uch, however, is the force of pre|judice, as to render doubtful even the evidence of our &s;en&s;es. A con&s;iderable increa&s;e in the number of deaths, among&s;t the Ru&s;&s;ians, hap|pening
<PB N="viii" REF="036328_0007_1008E3532776A940">
in the month of January, a rumour was immediately propagated that this mortal|ity was occa&s;ioned by the nitrous fumigation, which, though it might &s;eem harmle&s;s in the beginning, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome latent deleterious quality that in the end proved fatal.</P>
<P>Hearing of this by accident, and knowing how difficult it is to remove impre&s;&s;ions that have once laid hold of the public mind, I made application to Lord Spencer, and to the other Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Ad|miralty, reque&s;ting that they would have the goodne&s;s to appoint proper per&s;ons to inve&s;|tigate this matter fully, and to report to their Lord&s;hips the re&s;ult of their inquiry. My reque&s;t was complied with, and the report of tho&s;e gentlemen proved in the mo&s;t &s;atisfac|tory manner, that the rumour was a direct mi&s;repre&s;entation of the fact; that the mor|tality among&s;t the Ru&s;&s;ians was owing to different cau&s;es unconnected with the fumi|gation; that tho&s;e who had been longe&s;t
<PB N="ix" REF="036328_0008_1008EC32CCEAD2E0">
expo&s;ed to it enjoyed the be&s;t health; and that not a &s;ingle in&s;tance could be adduced of any bad con&s;equence which could fairly be imputed to the nitrous vapour, during the three months it had been employed.</P>
<P>This objection being removed, another &s;till pre&s;ented it&s;elf. It had been &s;aid, and &s;aid with truth, that the vitriolic acid, in a con|centrated &s;tate (commonly called oil of vitriol) was a dangerous article to be taken on board of &s;hip, as there had been in&s;tances of &s;hips &s;et on fire by it; and that this accident actu|ally happened to two tran&s;ports of Admiral Chri&s;tian's &s;quadron. The fact could not be denied; but the &s;ame objection applied, and with &s;till greater force, to the u&s;e of fire, of gun-powder, and of ardent &s;pirits; all of which are, without doubt, extremely hazard|ous in the hands of ignorance or of ra&s;hne&s;s; but which, when their effects are known, with the proper means of obviating them, may be employed with as much &s;afety as air or water.
<PB N="x" REF="036328_0009_1008EC3459C8B540">
To do away, however, every po&s;&s;ible objec|tion on this head, I had proper ca&s;es made, one for the mineral acids, and another for the purified nitre, with the in&s;truments nece&s;&s;ary for the fumigation. The mineral acids were fir&s;t put into &s;trong gla&s;s bottles, fitted with ground gla&s;s &s;toppers, &s;ecured with wire; the&s;e were placed in a ca&s;e lined with copper covered with an amalgama of tin and lead, with divi&s;ions of the &s;ame; the inter&s;tices of the divi&s;ions were afterwards filled up with &s;aw-du&s;t: by this means the bottles were &s;e|cured from breaking, and even if that &s;hould happen, the acids could not e&s;cape, nor affect the lining of the ca&s;e; &s;o that every danger which could po&s;&s;ibly ari&s;e was completely fore&s;een and prevented. A ca&s;e &s;imilar to the former, but entirely of wood, with divi&s;ions of the &s;ame, was made for holding the nitre: the nitre was put into four &s;tone or earthen jars, adapted to four divi&s;ions in the ca&s;e, which had a fifth divi&s;ion al&s;o, the whole
<PB N="xi" REF="036328_0010_1008EC364C92FE80">
width of the ca&s;e, for containing the pipkins, cups, mea&s;ures, and other in&s;truments nece&s;|&s;ary for the fumigation. The&s;e ca&s;es I &s;ent to the Admiralty for the in&s;pection of their Lord&s;hips, and as they met with their appro|bation, their Lord&s;hips ordered &s;imilar ca&s;es to be made and &s;ent on board every &s;hip in his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice; and that the materials nece&s;&s;ary for the nitrous fumigation &s;hould be &s;ent al&s;o to the different naval ho&s;pitals and pri&s;ons. I need hardly add, that the greater part of the experiments and trials which I have now the honour to lay before the public, are the re&s;ult of this order of the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Admiralty.</P>
<P>Many of tho&s;e communications have been &s;ent to me, as will pre&s;ently appear, by the Board for &s;ick and wounded &s;eamen; but for &s;everal, by far the mo&s;t important, I am in|debted to the friend&s;hip of Dr. John&s;ton, one of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of that Board, a gentleman who&s;e humanity and active zeal in
<PB N="xii" REF="036328_0011_1008EC37D801FB18">
the &s;ervice of his country are well known, and who&s;e character &s;tands too high in the public opinion to receive any addition from my prai&s;e. He was fortunately one of the extra-Commi&s;&s;ioners at Port&s;mouth, when &s;ome of the fir&s;t trials were made with the nitrous fumigation, and from the happy effects pro|duced by it, became a warm advocate in its behalf; a circum&s;tance which fir&s;t introduced me to the honour of his acquaintance.</P>
<P>As for the gentlemen them&s;elves who have made the trials with the nitrous fumigation, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that they cannot be &s;u&s;|pected, in the reports or opinions they have delivered on this &s;ubject, to have been influ|enced by any partiality to me; as, excepting Captain Lane of the navy, I had not the ho|nour of the &s;lighte&s;t acquaintance with any of them; and &s;everal, though they had heard of the experiment on board the Union, had never read a word I had written on the &s;ub|ject. It appears, however, very evident from
<PB N="xiii" REF="036328_0012_1008EC3CE02A5830">
their letters, that there are among&s;t them men of ob&s;ervation and experience, and if we may judge from the important &s;tations in which &s;ome of them are placed, they are men of high and re&s;pectable characters in the &s;ervice. Re&s;pecting their ob&s;ervations, I may fairly &s;ay, that in general, they carry with them the internal evidence of truth. But I &s;hall exa|mine this &s;ubject more particularly, after having pre&s;ented the public with the letters and communications of the authors.</P>
<P>Of the Introduction I have only to remark, that it contains tho&s;e general ob&s;ervations on the jail and other putrid contagions, with the u&s;ual means of obviating the&s;e, formerly publi&s;hed in the Treati&s;e on the Fever at Winche&s;ter; and now republi&s;hed, from a wi&s;h to make them more generally known, e&s;pecially to tho&s;e per&s;ons who are likely to be placed in &s;imilar &s;ituations, or engaged in &s;imilar enterpri&s;es. It does not fall to the lot of every &s;urgeon, or even phy&s;ician, to the
<PB N="xiv" REF="036328_0013_1008EC3E6BDE4D08">
navy or army, to have turned his attention to this &s;ubject in the manner I have done, nor to have had the &s;ame means or opportunity of information. The chief object of my life has been to render my profe&s;&s;ion, and the exerci&s;e of it as beneficial as po&s;&s;ible to mankind; my endeavours, however, to bring to perfection, and into general u&s;e, the pre&s;ent di&s;covery, have been chiefly animated, and I am not a&s;hamed to confe&s;s it, by the de&s;ire of render|ing an important &s;ervice to my country. She, as the great maritime power in Europe, is the mo&s;t likely to derive, and I flatter my&s;elf, will derive the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential benefit from my labours.</P>

<HEAD>Re&s;pecting the Nature of the Contagion, which gives ri&s;e to the Jail or Ho&s;pital Fever.</HEAD>
<P>THAT we may be able to form a more accurate judgment of the nature of the contagion, which gives ri&s;e to this &s;pecies of fever, we &s;hall examine it in four different points of view.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, how it is generated; 2dly, in what manner it is propagated, with the circum|&s;tances more or le&s;s favourable to its communica|tion; 3dly, its effects on the human body; and, 4thly, the means of weakening its virulence or of entirely de&s;troying it.</P>
<P>Whoever has con&s;idered contagious fevers with that attention which the importance of the &s;ubject demands, mu&s;t have ob&s;erved, that they are of two very di&s;tinct kinds or<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This di&s;tinction &s;eems &s;o extremely obvious, that we &s;hould hardly &s;uppo&s;e it could e&s;cape the ob&s;ervation of any one who had at all reflected on the &s;ubject, and yet I do not know any medical writer who has made it</NOTE> cla&s;&s;es. The fir&s;t may pro|perly enough be called <HI>&s;pecific contagions,</HI> as they do not ari&s;e from any general quality, or proce&s;s of nature, with which we are acquainted; and, as they have a peculiar origin, they excite di&s;ea&s;es of a peculiar kind; differing in many re&s;pects from every other, but in nothing more remarkably, than in this, that the peculiar di&s;ea&s;e can only take place once in any individual: and there are &s;ome per&s;ons,
<PB N="18" REF="036328_0019_1008EC4A6D259630">
in whom this contagion never can produce any mor|bid &s;ymptom. The number of tho&s;e peculiar or &s;pecific poi&s;ons is not yet a&s;certained; but the &s;mall|pox and mea&s;les are evidently &s;uch to man, and there are others peculiar to certain animals.</P>
<P>The &s;econd cla&s;s of contagious fevers, may be named <HI>general contagions,</HI> as they ari&s;e from a gene|ral cau&s;e; or they may be named <HI>putrid,</HI> as they will be found, in every in&s;tance, to be the re&s;ult of putrefaction, one of tho&s;e general fermentative pro|ce&s;&s;es, to which water as well as all vegetable and animal &s;ub&s;tances, under certain circum&s;tances, are liable. That the contagion, or mia&s;ma, of the jail or ho&s;pital fever derives its origin from this &s;ource, admits of every &s;pecies of evidence which a matter of fact and of ob&s;ervation can do.</P>
<P>It is well known, that this di&s;ea&s;e is con&s;tantly produced where a number of people are &s;hut up together in a clo&s;e place, without the greate&s;t at|tention to cleanline&s;s, and a renewal of air. That all the excretions of the human body have made a certain advance or progre&s;s towards putridity, and when placed in circum&s;tances favourable to putre|faction, &s;oon become highly putrid. That of all the human excretions, none is more highly ani|mali&s;ed, or more &s;u&s;ceptible of becoming putrid, than the per&s;piration or vapour i&s;&s;uing from the &s;ur|face of the body and lungs. That even the per&s;pi|ration of vegetables, confined under &s;imilar circum|&s;tances, becomes putrid, and in a high degree noxi|ous to man: <HI>a fortiori</HI> then, we may conclude, that animal per&s;piration will more quickly undergo a &s;imi|lar alteration, and mu&s;t prove &s;till more noxious.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Manner in which Contagion is communicated.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY per&s;on knows that contagious fevers, whether <HI>&s;pecific</HI> or <HI>putrid,</HI> are u&s;ually propagated by an immediate communication with the &s;ick, either by contact or contiguity. How far the con|tagious atmo&s;phere extends, is impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;cer|tain, as this mu&s;t admit of <HI>con&s;iderable</HI> latitude<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This &s;ubject the reader will find treated more fully in two Letters addre&s;&s;ed to Dr. Percival, of Manche&s;ter.</NOTE>, according to the virulence of the di&s;ea&s;e, &s;ituation of the &s;ick, &s;ea&s;on of the year, &s;tate of the atmo&s;|phere, &amp;c. My ingenious and re&s;pectable friend Dr. Haygarth is of opinion, and indeed has &s;hewn, that in the &s;mall-pox it is much more limited than was apprehended. But it is not only from a direct communication with the &s;ick that contagious fevers are propagated; unfortunately, the per&s;ons and clothes of tho&s;e who remain long in a contagious atmo&s;phere, and the excretions of the &s;ick, are capable (even when conveyed to a great di&s;tance, or pre&s;erved for a length of time) of producing the &s;ame mi&s;chief as an immediate communication with the &s;ick them&s;elves. Of this fact the examples are &s;o numerous as to put the matter beyond the po&s;&s;i|bility of a doubt. Here again, the opinion of my friend Dr. Haygarth differs from the opinions formerly entertained by phy&s;icians. For, though he admits, that the variolous matter, and the more &s;en&s;ible excretions of the &s;ick, are capable of com|municating the di&s;ea&s;e, and, if clo&s;e &s;hut up, of retaining that power for a long time, he does not think, that the contagious vapour, immediately
<PB N="21" REF="036328_0022_1008EC5135FEB548">
ari&s;ing from the &s;ick, can be retained by the clothes of tho&s;e confined in the variolous atmo&s;phere, or by the furniture in the chambers of the &s;ick, &s;o as to communicate the di&s;ea&s;e to &s;uch as have not them&s;elves been immediately expo&s;ed to it. No one can have a greater re&s;pect for the opinions and ob&s;ervations of Dr. Haygarth than I have, as no per&s;on is better acquainted with his candour and accuracy. I readily agree with him, that the dread of tho&s;e terrible di&s;ea&s;es, and the natural fears of men, have po&s;&s;ibly magnified the danger beyond reality; that the ri&s;k of propagating the contagion in this manner is by no means &s;o great as had been &s;uppo&s;ed; and that phy&s;icians, or even apothecaries, are &s;eldom &s;o long expo&s;ed to this atmo&s;phere, as to be in great danger of conveying the contagion el&s;ewhere; but I cannot go &s;o far as to believe that the per&s;ons, and e&s;pecially the clothes of nur&s;es or a&s;&s;i&s;tants, who are con&s;tantly confined in the chambers of the &s;ick, &s;ometimes not very well ven|tilated, will not imbibe the contagious vapour to &s;uch a degree, as to be capable of communicating it, e&s;pecially where they have a direct or immediate intercour&s;e with a per&s;on &s;u&s;ceptible of the di&s;ea&s;e. But, putting the &s;mall-pox and other <HI>&s;pecific conta|gions</HI> out of the que&s;tion, that the jail di&s;temper and other <HI>putrid contagions</HI> are frequently conveyed in this manner, cannot be denied. Indeed, wherever a vapour can be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the &s;mell, we have the demon&s;tration of our &s;en&s;es for what a length of time, not only clothes, but furniture, and even the boards and walls of hou&s;es will retain it: there|fore, in re&s;pect to the contagion of the jail or ho&s;|pital fever, we may &s;afely affirm, that it affects not only tho&s;e who are immediately expo&s;ed to the origi|nal atmo&s;phere, but that this contagion may cer|tainly be communicated by the clothes of per&s;ons
<PB N="22" REF="036328_0023_1008EC52C6296098">
who have for any length of time been confined in it; and, what is &s;till more &s;urpri&s;ing, even when the per&s;ons them&s;elves have &s;uffered no injury, nor had any di&s;ea&s;e in con&s;equence of &s;uch expo&s;ure.</P>
<P>This fact being a&s;certained, we cannot wonder if tho&s;e who are &s;eized with the jail fever, owing to &s;uch communication, &s;hould during their illne&s;s generate a contagious vapour; but, however para|doxical it may appear, I have never ob&s;erved that the &s;ick propagated the di&s;ea&s;e &s;o readily, as the bodies and clothes of tho&s;e who, though well, had been long confined in the original atmo&s;phere. From my own experience al&s;o, I am led to conclude, that there is little ri&s;k of receiving the contagion from dead bodies, even from di&s;&s;ecting them, pro|vided the &s;urgeon does not cut him&s;elf during the di&s;&s;ection, the con&s;equence of which has generally proved fatal.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal other circum&s;tances, worthy of notice, that increa&s;e or dimini&s;h the facility with which contagion is communicated. Unle&s;s where contagion is very powerful, it is &s;eldom propagated in the open air; I knew only one in&s;tance of this at Winche&s;ter. It is much more certainly commu|nicated in a room, and e&s;pecially if there is a cur|rent of air, from the contagious per&s;on to others capable of being affected. A moi&s;t atmo&s;phere<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Moi&s;ture appears not only nece&s;&s;ary to the production of putrid contagion, but it would &s;eem to be the medium al&s;o by which it is communicated; it is well known, that the plague cea&s;es, in Syria and Egypt, during the preva|lence of certain drying winds; and its almo&s;t entirely di&s;ap|pearing during the winter, at Mo&s;cow, was probably owing to the &s;ame cau&s;e; <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the dryne&s;s of the atmo&s;phere.</NOTE> is al&s;o more favourable to the communication of con|tagion than a dry one.

<HEAD>Of the Effects of putrid Contagion on the human Body.</HEAD>
<P>PUTRID matter, in whatever way generated, if in &s;ufficient quantity, has always &s;ome deleterious effect; or, in other words, acts as a poi&s;on upon the body. It is true, that the human &s;tomach, and &s;till more remarkably, the organs of dige&s;tion of certain animals, have the power of counteracting the &s;eptic tendency; but this power, in our &s;to|machs at lea&s;t, is very limited; and when any mat|ter, whether generated in the body or introduced from without, has acquired a degree of putridity beyond this, it occa&s;ions nau&s;ea, vomiting, purging, great oppre&s;&s;ion at the region of the &s;tomach, and often a fever, either of the intermittent, remittent, or more continued kind. Putrid matter, directly introduced into the &s;y&s;tem by means of a wound, cau&s;es &s;welling and inflammation of the lymphatic glands, often terminating &s;uddenly in gangrene, along with the &s;ymptoms of a fever, greatly re&s;em|bling the ho&s;pital or jail fever: the &s;ame pro&s;tra|tion of &s;trength, tremors, anxiety, headach, and
<PB N="24" REF="036328_0025_1008EC5755623A58">
delirium; with the &s;ame irregularity in the pul&s;e, and, if the di&s;ea&s;e continues, it induces tho&s;e ap|pearances of the &s;kin, hemorrhages, and other &s;ymptoms, that indicate a relaxation of the &s;olids, and re&s;olved cra&s;is of the blood. The fevers that ari&s;e in con&s;equence of expo&s;ure to putrid vapour or contagion, a&s;&s;ume a variety of types and forms, according to the various circum&s;tances of combina|tion, degree of putridity, &s;ea&s;on of the year, con|&s;titution of the patient, &amp;c. But they, as well as the preceding, will be found to have many &s;ymp|toms in common, and &s;imilar to the jail and ho&s;pi|tal fever: and in reality all the fevers of this cla&s;s, from the &s;lighte&s;t vernal intermittent to the true plague, are in my opinion only different &s;hades or varieties of the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, and productions of one common cau&s;e, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> putrefaction. I &s;hall not, how|ever, pro&s;ecute this &s;ubject farther at pre&s;ent, as I have treated it more fully in another work, which, &s;hould I hereafter have lei&s;ure to complete, I hope to render not altogether unworthy of the public eye.</P>
<P>The contagion then of the jail or ho&s;pital fever, may ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as one of the mo&s;t &s;ubtil and powerful vapours of the putrid kind; and, con|&s;equently, its immediate and de&s;tructive effects upon the body, are not to be wondered at. In ordinary ca&s;es of fever, the vital principle is rou&s;ed into ac|tion, and Nature is commonly &s;ufficient of her&s;elf to remove the morbid cau&s;e; but here, as in the real pe&s;tilence, the contagion introduced into the body, &s;eems to act as a narcotic poi&s;on upon the heart and nervous &s;y&s;tem, &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the principle of life, in|&s;tead of rou&s;ing it to the conflict. In this di&s;temper therefore, where nature can do &s;o little, and even art, unle&s;s immediately called to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, is equally unavailing, it is of the mo&s;t con&s;equence for

<HEAD>Of the Means of preventing, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> destroying the Jail Contagion.</HEAD>
<P>As we are perfectly acquainted with the cau&s;es of the jail contagion, we could certainly prevent its formation, provided the means of doing &s;o were al|ways in our power; but as we cannot command the&s;e, our next object is to endeavour to correct, or de&s;troy it, when formed. As a knowledge of the nature and origin of the jail contagion naturally led to the proper and effectual means of correcting or de&s;troying it, &s;o, on the other hand, the means that have been &s;ucce&s;sfully employed to de&s;troy it, afford the mo&s;t convincing evidence of its true nature.</P>
<P>The various means hitherto employed for de&s;troy|ing contagion, may be arranged under two di&s;tinct heads, or cla&s;&s;es, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the Phy&s;ical and the Chemical.</P>
<P>All contagions, whether &s;pecific or putrid, are either checked or completely de&s;troyed, by the ex|tremes of heat and cold; and from a free expo&s;ure to air and water, are &s;o diluted or di&s;&s;olved, as to lo&s;e their noxious quality. Heat and cold then, with air and water, may be looked upon as phy&s;i|cal agents, which, under certain circum&s;tances, are effectual in blunting or de&s;troying contagion. A de|gree of heat, nearly that of an oven, is found ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the complete de&s;truction of contagion, but as this degree of heat is incompatible with ani|mal life,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A great heat, like that of an oven, &s;uch as would prove de&s;tructive to all animal life, effectually de&s;troys this infection in all &s;ub&s;tances which can be for &s;ome time expo&s;ed to it. Vide Lind's Ob&s;ervations on the Jail Di&s;temper, Ann. 1779</NOTE> its application is &s;olely confined to the
<PB N="26" REF="036328_0027_1008EC5EE8C6ACC8">
purifying of &s;uch clothes, furniture, &amp;c. as cannot be injured by this treatment. But, although the degree of heat requi&s;ite for the complete de&s;truction of contagion can only be u&s;ed for one particular purpo&s;e, heat and fire, judiciou&s;ly managed, may, in various ways tend to le&s;&s;en the power, or to check the progre&s;s of this pernicious vapour: for as clo&s;e|ne&s;s and dampne&s;s are favourable to the production and &s;preading of contagion, drying and rarefying the air, by counteracting the&s;e, mu&s;t, &s;o far at lea&s;t, be proper antidotes. But, independent of tho&s;e effects of heat, an open fire, e&s;pecially where the fuel is burnt in a narrow flue, is of great benefit; for, by con&s;uming a portion of the air; it cau&s;es a more &s;en&s;ible renewal of it, and, in fact, is one of the be&s;t ventilators. In employing fire and heat, however, care mu&s;t be taken not to increa&s;e the heat in the apartments of the &s;ick, as this would prove more hurtful to them, than the drying or renewing of the air could be advantageous.</P>
<P>The degree of cold nece&s;&s;ary to de&s;troy contagion is probably, like the degree of heat, incon&s;i&s;tent with life; and, therefore, although we hear of con|tagion having been checked or &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by cold, there are few in&s;tances, if any, of its being com|pletely de&s;troyed. Be&s;ides, as it is not in our power to employ cold at plea&s;ure, the que&s;tion re&s;pecting its effect, of whatever importance it may be to the pathologi&s;t, is of little con&s;equence to the practical phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>That noxious vapours are hurtful only when con|centrated, and are harmle&s;s when diffu&s;ed, are facts or data univer&s;ally admitted; and it is upon this principle, that clothes, bedding, or other matters to which contagion adheres, are purified, or lo&s;e their deleterious quality, by expo&s;ure for a &s;ufficient

Paper 1. p. 49.</NOTE> of a wood fire was reckoned, by Dr. Lind, one of the mo&s;t powerful means of de&s;troying contagion, and he gives &s;everal examples where it was &s;ucce&s;sfully employed. I might perhaps remark that &s;ome of the&s;e examples he had from per&s;ons who were not &s;uch accurate ob&s;ervers as him&s;elf; I &s;hall not however call them in que&s;tion, as I think the advantage &s;uppo&s;ed to be immediately derived from the &s;moke of wood, may fairly be a&s;cribed to other cau&s;es. In the fir&s;t place, the &s;moke of wood con&s;i&s;ts principally of &s;oot, or of inflammable matter uncon&s;umed, with &s;ome carbonic acid, neither of which can have any effect on contagion; whil&s;t the ligneous acid is in very &s;mall quantity, too &s;mall certainly to be of much &s;ervice. But we know, that where there is &s;moke there is heat, and that where there is much &s;moke, in places where people are pre&s;ent, a free admi&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be given to the air; two circum&s;tances which have con&s;iderable influence in weakening the viru|lence, and in preventing the &s;preading of contagion.</P>

though I believe it to be one of the mo&s;t trifling means that has ever yet been employed. I have never once ob&s;erved the &s;malle&s;t benefit from its u&s;e; and have known many fatal examples of con|tagion having been communicated where it was con|&s;tantly employed. But although the &s;team of boil|ing vinegar can be of no advantage in de&s;troying contagion, yet, as the &s;mell of it is grateful to the &s;ick, it may for that rea&s;on be u&s;ed about their per|&s;ons; and when camphire is di&s;&s;olved in it, the &s;mell is &s;till more agreeable and reviving.</P>
<P>Wa&s;hing the furniture, floors, walls, &amp;c. with vinegar, I con&s;ider as little better than wa&s;hing them with &s;imple water. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of white-wa&s;hing, as the lime and &s;ize can have no particular effect. Oil painting, another mode of purifying apartments, has little advantage over the preceding; not to mention the expen&s;e and incon|venience attending it.</P>
<P>But enough has been &s;aid to &s;hew the general want of chemical knowledge, apparent in all the methods hitherto propo&s;ed for de&s;troying contagion, and more e&s;pecially, the inefficacy of the methods employed in places and &s;ituations from which peo|ple could not be removed; I &s;hall now proceed to a more agreeable ta&s;k, and explain tho&s;e improve|ments, which a more accurate chemi&s;try, and a long attention to the &s;ubject, have &s;ugge&s;ted to me, and relate &s;ome experiments which I made, with a view to a&s;certain the efficacy of the nitrous acid, and the &s;afety with which it may be u&s;ed, where people are nece&s;&s;arily pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The mineral acids, particularly when in a &s;tate of vapour, with the different ga&s;es or permanently ela&s;tic fluids produced by them, are probably, ex|cepting fire, the mo&s;t powerful agents in nature,
<PB N="33" REF="036328_0034_1008EC74D289F4D8">
and the &s;ource of an infinite number of the differ|ent forms of matter ob&s;ervable in the mineral king|dom, and which are con&s;tantly undergoing fre&s;h changes, from their various combinations, and de|compo&s;itions. But their power is not confined to the mineral kingdom; they are known to have great influence likewi&s;e over putrefaction, and tho&s;e other &s;pontaneous changes which vegetable and animal matter, deprived of life, undergoes; and therefore, if the jail contagion, as I have endea|voured to prove, is a vapour produced by putre|faction, there cannot be a doubt that the mineral acids will prove effectual in de&s;troying it. So far we may rea&s;on <HI>a priori;</HI> but let us next con&s;ult ex|perience, a le&s;s fallible guide. From this it ap|pears, that the volatile vitriolic or &s;ulphureous acid, the only one hitherto made u&s;e of, proves effectual in de&s;troying contagion; although owing to its de|leterious quality, it cannot be employed, except in &s;ituations from which people can be removed. But, are the other mineral acids in a &s;tate of va|pour equally dangerous with the &s;ulphureous? and, are they equally effectual in de&s;troying contagion? To the fir&s;t of the&s;e que&s;tions I can give a po&s;itive an&s;wer; to the &s;econd I can give one that, at lea&s;t, is highly probable.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, I can &s;afely affirm, that the nitrous acid may be employed in very great quanti|ty without ri&s;k, and even without the &s;malle&s;t in|convenience; and, that it is effectual for the de|&s;troying of contagion, I have every rea&s;on to be|lieve, not only from analogy, but from experience. I had frequently u&s;ed the nitrous acid, as a fumiga|tion, in ho&s;pital wards, and in the private apart|ments of the &s;ick, without perceiving any unplea|&s;ant effect from it; but, to a&s;certain with more
<PB N="34" REF="036328_0035_1008EC7670D841D8">
preci&s;ion a fact of this importance, I made the fol|lowing experiments; in the conducting of which, Mr. Hume of Long-acre, a very ingenious man, and an excellent chemi&s;t, was &s;o obliging as to fa|vour me with his a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>We put a mou&s;e, confined in a wire trap, under a gla&s;s cylindrical jar, capable of holding about 25 pints beer mea&s;ure, or 881 cubic inches; the jar was inverted upon wet &s;and, contained in a flat earthen trough or pan; it was then filled with the fumes of the &s;moking nitrous acid, introduced by means of a crooked gla&s;s tube, until the animal could not be very di&s;tinctly perceived. The mou&s;e was kept in this &s;ituation for a quarter of an hour, when the jar was removed, and the animal expo&s;ed to the open air; it immediately ran about the wire trap, as u&s;ual, and had not the appearance of hav|ing &s;uffered the &s;lighte&s;t inconvenience from its con|finement. After a few minutes, the mou&s;e was again put under the gla&s;s jar, which was now filled with the vapour of pure nitrous acid, detached from nitre by the vitriolic acid. It remained much about the &s;ame time as before, and when the jar was re|moved, &s;eemed perfectly well.</P>
<P>We repeated the &s;ame experiments with a green-finch, only with &s;ome little variation in the manner. We placed, on a table covered with green baize, a brown earthen ve&s;&s;el or pan, containing heated &s;and; in this was put a gla&s;s &s;aucer, with about half an ounce of &s;trong vitriolic acid; above which we placed the bird-cage, &s;upported with &s;ome &s;mall pieces of wood laid acro&s;s the pan; then, add|ing a drachm or two of nitre, in powder, to the vitriolic acid, we covered the whole with the gla&s;s jar. The nitrous acid ro&s;e in &s;uch quantity, that, in a very little time, the bird &s;eemed as if in a
<PB N="35" REF="036328_0036_1008EC7A08C014F0">
cloud or fog. We kept it in this &s;ituation fifteen minutes, by which time the cloud had di&s;appeared, and the acid was in part conden&s;ed on the &s;ide of the gla&s;s jar; during the whole time the bird nei|ther panted, nor appeared to &s;uffer any unea&s;ine&s;s, from the atmo&s;phere in which it was confined. We made trial al&s;o of the marine acid, by adding common &s;alt, in&s;tead of nitre, to heated vitriolic acid: during this experiment, the bird appeared to be, now and then, &s;omewhat unea&s;y, and opened its bill; but at the end of fifteen minutes, upon removing the jar, it hopped about as lively as be|fore. We then expo&s;ed the bird to the fumes of &s;ulphur, burnt with an eighth part of nitre; it im|mediately gave &s;igns of unea&s;ine&s;s, opened its bill, and &s;eemed to pant for breath in &s;uch a manner, that we were afraid to cover it with the gla&s;s jar. We likewi&s;e made trial, in the open air, of the ox|ygenated marine acid;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The oxygenated marine acid is a di&s;covery of the famous Scheele, and has been recommended by Berthollet and Chaptal, two French chemi&s;ts, for the purpo&s;e of bleaching. I am informed that it has al&s;o been lately u&s;ed in France to de&s;troy contagion, but the particular circum&s;tances, and manner of its application, I have not yet learnt.</NOTE> for, as this is &s;o extremely deleterious, we did not think it &s;afe to expo&s;e our|&s;elves to the vapour of it in a room, nor did we venture to expo&s;e the bird to it in any other way but in the open air, and even there it appeared to &s;uffer very much.</P>
<P>Having made trial of the effect of the different mineral acids, in a &s;tate of vapour, upon animals, we determined to render the experiment &s;till more conclu&s;ive, by trying what effect they would have on our&s;elves. With this intention, we filled the
<PB N="36" REF="036328_0037_1008EC7D757FDCA0">
room<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The room in which we made the experiments was a &s;mall parlour 13 feet by 10, and 8 feet high; or about 1040 cubic feet.</NOTE> in which we were with the fumes of nitrous acid, (obtained by mixing nitre with heated vitrio|lic acid, in the manner already de&s;cribed) until the different objects became &s;omewhat ob&s;cure, by a kind of fog or mi&s;t produced. The fire irons and &s;teel fender, lo&s;t their poli&s;h, and the vapour ari&s;|ing from a bottle of aqua ammoniae purae, placed at &s;ome di&s;tance from the table, was evidently neutralized, as it i&s;&s;ued from the bottle, by the vapour of the nitrous acid.</P>
<P>Mr. Hume and I remained in the room the whole time, without perceiving the &s;lighte&s;t inconveni|ence; the fumes did not excite coughing, nor affect the eyes, in the way the &s;moke of wood commonly does, even when I held my head over the gla&s;s &s;au|cer, and breathed them immediately ari&s;ing from it. We made trial likewi&s;e of the effect of the marine acid, which we found more pungent and &s;timulating than the nitrous; but, though it ex|cited coughing, it did not cau&s;e that con&s;triction of the windpipe, and tightne&s;s at the che&s;t, with the &s;en&s;e of &s;uffocation, which is immediately induced by the volatile vitriolic or &s;ulphureous acid. In|deed we were imprudent enough to try how far we could breathe this la&s;t, but I was in&s;tantly obliged to run to the window for air, from the &s;en&s;e of con&s;triction, and of &s;uffocation, which it occa&s;ion|ed. We likewi&s;e tried the effect of the mixed fumes of the marine and nitrous acid, a kind of volatile aqua regia, which we found more pungent than the marine acid by it&s;elf. As for the oxygen|ated marine acid, perceiving the effect of it on the
<PB N="37" REF="036328_0038_1008EC7F07FEB508">
bird, and knowing how extremely dangerous it is, we did not venture to go very near it.</P>
<P>From the preceding experiments, the different acid vapours, in re&s;pect to the &s;afety with which they may be breathed, may be arranged in the following order:

</LIST></P>
<P>As the fir&s;t vapour is perfectly harmle&s;s, in any quantity in which it may be required, it is evident|ly the mo&s;t proper to be employed in all &s;ituations where people are nece&s;&s;arily pre&s;ent; and if it &s;hould prove efficacious in de&s;troying contagion, of which I have not the &s;malle&s;t doubt, it is the <HI>de&s;i|deratum,</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A certain method therefore of de&s;troying infection in places from whence per&s;ons cannot be removed, is a <HI>de&s;ider|atum</HI> not yet obtained in phy&s;ic.

which he confe&s;&s;es, with his u&s;ual candour, he never could find out.</P>
<P>The &s;econd, though more pungent than the fir&s;t, may I believe be employed with the greate&s;t &s;afety; at lea&s;t, I have never ob&s;erved any inconvenience from u&s;ing it. But, as it cannot &s;o ea&s;ily be pro|cured in con&s;iderable quantity, and is attended with greater inconvenience and expen&s;e, I have of late years only made u&s;e of the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Our experiments likewi&s;e warrant us to affirm, that the third, or marine acid, though more &s;timu|lating, and more apt to excite coughing, than the nitrous, may be &s;afely u&s;ed, at lea&s;t in a moderate quantity, where people are pre&s;ent; and where ni|tre cannot be had, I &s;hould have no he&s;itation in employing it.</P>
<P>Of the fourth I can &s;ay but little, only that, in breathing it, I perceived it more pungent than the pure marine acid; and therefore, unle&s;s it &s;hould be found to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uperior efficacy in de&s;troying contagion, I would not employ it where there are people pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>As the fifth never can be u&s;ed with &s;afety where there are people pre&s;ent, its u&s;e mu&s;t be &s;olely con|fined to fumigating empty apartments, clothes, fur|niture, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth &s;hould never be employed, as the car|bonic acid may do harm, and never can have any effect on contagion.</P>
<P>Of the &s;eventh I have no particular knowledge, only that it is extremely deleterious, and I believe extremely powerful; but whether it has more effect
<PB N="39" REF="036328_0040_1008EC8381C61DE8">
on contagion than the other mineral acids, experi|ence only can determine.</P>
<P>Having now fully proved that the nitrous, and po&s;&s;ibly al&s;o the marine acid, obtained in the man|ner already de&s;cribed, may be employed with per|fect &s;afety in ho&s;pital and pri&s;on wards, whil&s;t the people remain in them, I &s;hall, in the next place, relate how far my experience goes to a&s;certain the efficacy of tho&s;e acids in de&s;troying contagion.</P>
<P>From all the information I can procure, I do not find that any per&s;on had ever made u&s;e of the ni|trous acid to de&s;troy contagion but my&s;elf; for, as this acid is not produced by the deflagration of ni|tre, or of gunpowder, the employment of the&s;e cannot be con&s;idered as an in&s;tance to the contrary. I formerly mentioned, that I had employed the ni|trous acid in two different forms; either the va|pour ari&s;ing from the yellow or &s;moking nitrous acid, which is a mixture of the acid with nitrous gas, or the more pure nitrous acid, detached from nitre, decompo&s;ed by the vitriolic acid. In one or other of tho&s;e forms I have u&s;ed it, both in ho&s;pitals and in private practice, for &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen years pa&s;t; and have had the &s;atisfaction to obtain the mo&s;t deci&s;ive evidence of its happy effect, in pre|venting the &s;preading, or farther communication of contagion.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t highly contagious fevers that occur in our ho&s;pitals, do not affect the patients in general lodged in the &s;ame ward, but only the nur&s;es, or tho&s;e patients who a&s;&s;i&s;t them, or tho&s;e who lie in the beds contiguous to the &s;ick; to &s;uch per&s;ons I have frequently &s;een the fever communicated, and have al&s;o repeatedly prevented the farther &s;preading of the di&s;ea&s;e, by placing gallipots, with the fum|ing nitrous acid, between the beds of the &s;ick and
<PB N="40" REF="036328_0041_1008EC8795E9F470">
of tho&s;e who were not yet affected by the conta|gion. And, in private practice, I can declare with truth, that where the nitrous acid has been con|&s;tantly u&s;ed as a fumigation, I have not known an in&s;tance of a contagious fever having been commu|nicated, even to a nur&s;e or an attendant.</P>
<P>The&s;e facts will, undoubtedly, be allowed to be very &s;trong evidence, with re&s;pect to the power of the nitrous acid to de&s;troy contagion; &s;till, howev|er, they are liable to &s;ome uncertainty, and I will freely confe&s;s, that the effect of the nitrous acid, for this purpo&s;e, cannot be &s;aid to be fully proved, until it has been tried in fumigating tainted clothes, &amp;c. and until its power has been found &s;ufficient to de&s;troy contagion on board of &s;hips, and in pri&s;ons and ho&s;pitals, where it exi&s;ts in a much higher de|gree than I have had occa&s;ion to &s;ee it, excepting at Winche&s;ter.</P>
<P>It will probably be a&s;ked, why I did not make a complete trial of it there? To this I an&s;wer, that with re&s;pect to fumigating infected clothes, bed|ding, &amp;c. I did not think my&s;elf warranted, e&s;pe|cially on an occa&s;ion of &s;o much importance, to make trial of an uncertain remedy, when a certain one was in my power. As to fumigating the pri&s;on and ho&s;pital wards, it was evidently my intention to have employed the nitrous acid, but I was mi&s;|taken in the means I took to procure it, and have not &s;ince had a proper opportunity of repeating the experiment.</P>
<P>The effect of the marine acid, in a &s;tate of va|pour, on contagion, I have not yet had occa&s;ion to try, but have no doubt that it will be found of &s;uf|ficient efficacy for de&s;troying it; and, from the foregoing experiments, it is evident that, though not &s;o mild or &s;afe as the nitrous acid, it may be
<PB N="41" REF="036328_0042_1008EC8B74897298">
u&s;ed, in a moderate quantity, even where people are pre&s;ent. The only purpo&s;e to which I have ap|plied it, has been, when properly diluted, to wa&s;h the hammock po&s;ts, bed&s;teads, and furniture; al&s;o the floors, and walls, of the apartments of the &s;ick:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The wa&s;hing the hammock po&s;ts, walls, and floors of the pri&s;on wards with the diluted marine acid, and the re|moval of all clothes, bedding, &amp;c. proved completely effec|tual for de&s;troying the contagion at Winche&s;ter; as it is now apparent, that the burning or deflagrating of nitre could con|tribute nothing to the &s;ucce&s;s.</NOTE> and I am per&s;uaded that, even in this way, it was extremely &s;erviceable, certainly more powerful than the mo&s;t concentrated vinegar.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now conclude this &s;ubject with a few prac|tical rules or ob&s;ervations, which may be looked upon as corollaries, or inductions, from the pre|ceding experiments.</P>
<P>The well known efficacy of the &s;ulphureous acid, in de&s;troying contagion, is a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for our continuing to u&s;e it as a fumigation for clothes, furniture, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The nitrous acid, being attended with no ri&s;k or inconvenience to the re&s;piration, and appearing, from our experience, of &s;ufficient efficacy to prevent the farther &s;preading of contagion, &s;eems the proper antidote to be applied, in all &s;ituations where per|&s;ons are nece&s;&s;arily pre&s;ent, and is, in &s;hort, the <HI>de|&s;ideratum</HI> &s;ought after by the benevolent Dr. Lind.</P>
<P>For purifying empty ho&s;pital or pri&s;on wards, and &s;hips, I &s;hould al&s;o prefer the nitrous acid to the &s;ulphureous; as I believe it to be equally effi|cacious; its vapour is more volatile and penetra|ting; and it does not leave the di&s;agreeable &s;mell which &s;ulphur does. But, for this particular ob|ject, I think it would be advi&s;eable to make trial
<PB N="42" REF="036328_0043_1008EC8D6D3B8F30">
al&s;o of the marine acid, and of the mixture of ni|trous and marine acids, as I am convinced of the efficacy of all the mineral acids for de&s;troying conta|gion, and our experience is not yet &s;ufficient to de|termine their relative advantages, and di&s;advantages.</P>
<P>To obtain the nitrous, or marine acid, in a &s;tate of vapour, the method is extremely &s;imple. It con|&s;i&s;ts in decompo&s;ing nitre, or common &s;alt, by means of heated vitriolic acid, which may be done as follows:</P>
<P>Put half an ounce<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As the quantity of vapour depends, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, on the &s;urface, I think it better to have the vitriolic acid put in a number of &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, than in one or two large ones; be&s;ides, in this way, it has the advantage of being diffu&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> in any given &s;pace.</NOTE> of vitriolic acid into a cruci|ble, or into a gla&s;s or china cup, or deep &s;aucer; warm this over a lamp, or in heated &s;and, adding to it from time to time &s;ome nitre or common &s;alt: the&s;e ve&s;&s;els &s;hould be placed at twenty or thirty feet di&s;tance from each other, according to the height of the cieling, or virulence of the contagion. In ho&s;pitals, or pri&s;ons, the lamps, or ve&s;&s;els con|taining heated &s;and, may be placed on the floor; on board of &s;hips, it will be better to hang them to the cieling by waxed &s;ilk cords. The fumigating lamps, which I have &s;een at Moy&s;er's, in Greek-&s;treet, Soho, a great number of which I was told have been &s;old to the navy, may be employed for this purpo&s;e; although they would an&s;wer much better, if the &s;aucer was deeper, and if, in&s;tead of a place for a lamp, there was a box proper for con|taining hot &s;and, in which the &s;aucer might be placed.</P>
<P>As fumigating with nitrous acid is attended with no inconvenience, and as the proce&s;s is &s;o &s;imple,
<PB N="43" REF="036328_0044_1008EC91A98C8920">
and the materials &s;o cheap, it &s;hould, as a means of prevention, be employed for &s;ome hours every day in tran&s;ports having troops on board, and in crouded ho&s;pitals; and, if there is any appearance of contagion, the fumigation &s;hould be executed with more care and attention, and the vapour con|fined for &s;everal hours at a time.

The two fir&s;t parts contain nothing new or intere&s;t|ing; the third is of the greate&s;t importance to me|dical &s;cience, and particularly &s;o to me, as it fur|ni&s;hes a proof of the accuracy of &s;ome of the pre|ceding experiments, and is a complete confirmation of the opinions I have long entertained re&s;pecting the nature of contagion, and the power of the mineral acids to de&s;troy it.</P>
<P>The French phy&s;icians, in&s;tructed by that excel|lent chemi&s;t <HI>Le Citoyen</HI> Guiton, better known by the name of Mon&s;. de Morveau, of Dijon, have lately made trial of the marine acid in their ho&s;pi|tals, and have found it equally effectual in de&s;troy|ing contagion as the &s;ulphureous, and, as being more volatile, perhaps even preferable for the pur|po&s;e of purifying ho&s;pital wards. They al&s;o re|marked that, in a &s;maller proportion, it may be &s;afely u&s;ed in ho&s;pital wards, even when people are pre&s;ent.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">My experiments &s;hewed the &s;ame thing.</NOTE>. The French phy&s;icians however have
<PB N="45" REF="036328_0046_1008EC95FA05BE98">
not employed the nitrous acid, nor made any trials of its effect on contagion; neither do they appear to have &s;u&s;pected that the power of de&s;troying con|tagion was a quality inherent in all mineral acids; and probably, to a certain degree, in all acids, un|der certain circum&s;tances. Although their experi|ence of the effect of the marine acid, together with my ob&s;ervations on that of the nitrous, &s;eems to e&s;tabli&s;h the fact beyond the cavil of &s;ceptici&s;m it|&s;elf.</P>
<P>Their method of obtaining the marine acid is the &s;ame that I took to procure the nitrous; they either employed the fuming marine acid, or the acid detached from its alkaline ba&s;is by vitriolic acid, u&s;ing a con&s;iderable degree of heat for that purpo&s;e.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reader will find at the end an account of their proce&s;s.</NOTE> They likewi&s;e, upon the &s;ugge&s;tion of M. Fourcroy, recommend adding a &s;mall quantity of the oxygenated marine acid; but, as they do not pretend to &s;ay that they have had any experi|ence of the &s;uperior efficacy of this, and as the common marine acid has been found to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e, I do not &s;ee any rea&s;on for making &s;o ha|zardous an addition.</P>
<P>Another chemical proce&s;s for purifying foul air in ho&s;pitals, recommended in this <HI>instruction,</HI> de|&s;erves our notice. It con&s;i&s;ts in placing, at dif|ferent di&s;tances in the ho&s;pital wards, ve&s;&s;els with lime water, for the purpo&s;e of ab&s;orbing carbonic acid or fixed air. I am inclined, however, to be|lieve, that this advice is more the re&s;ult of chemi|cal theory than of practical ob&s;ervation; for I do not &s;uppo&s;e that carbonic acid is ever pre&s;ent, (where there is a free admittance of air,) in &s;uffi|cient
<PB N="46" REF="036328_0047_1008EC978C88D4F0">
quantity to prove hurtful; at lea&s;t, it can only affect the breathing, and has nothing in com|mon with contagious vapour.</P>
<P>The French phy&s;icians appear to me to have fal|len into a con&s;iderable mi&s;take on this &s;ubject, in taking the quantity of carbonic acid pre&s;ent,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The method propo&s;ed by the French phy&s;icians, for a&s;certaining the quantity of carbonic acid pre&s;ent, is &s;imple and ingenious. Take two phials; let one be filled with common water, the other with lime water. At the place where you want to try the purity of the air, empty the phial of common water, then, filling it half full with lime-water, and corking it, &s;hake the phial for &s;ome time: the quantity of &s;ediment &s;hews the proportion of carbonic acid. But, to render the preceding experiment conclu&s;ive, the height from the ground at which the air is taken &s;hould be &s;tated, otherwi&s;e we are liable to great fallacy.</NOTE> in an ho&s;pital, as a te&s;t of the quantity or malignity of contagion, when, in reality, they are two things totally di&s;tinct from each other. The fir&s;t, or car|bonic acid, is a con&s;tituent part of the common or atmo&s;pheric air, which is greatly increa&s;ed by the re&s;piration of animals, and by burning candles, lamps, &amp;c. and, when in too great quantity, ex|tingui&s;hes flame, and animal life: the other has no relation with the compo&s;ition of the atmo&s;phere, never affects re&s;piration, but is produced by putri|dity, and excites fever.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE general opinion entertained of your Lord|&s;hip, in the high department, at the head of which you are placed, is the only apology I can offer for having taken the liberty to trouble you on the &s;ub|ject of my late publication. The immediate atten|tion paid to this by your Lord&s;hip, and by the re&s;t of the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Admiralty, is extremely flattering to me, as an individual, and claims my warme&s;t gratitude; but it is of much more importance, my Lord, as holding out to the nation, a well grounded confidence, that no object which may be conducive to the public &s;ervice, or to the pre&s;ervation of tho&s;e brave men, the pride and pro|tectors of their country, can long e&s;cape your Lord|&s;hip's notice. I have now the honor to lay before you, and the re&s;t of the Lord's Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Admiralty, an account of the Experiment made
<PB N="52" REF="036328_0052_1008ECA9DFEFCFD0">
on board the Union, at your Lord&s;hip's de&s;ire, and likewi&s;e of tho&s;e trials that were made at the de&s;ire of the Ru&s;&s;ian Admiral, and with your Lord&s;hip's approbation, on board &s;ome &s;hips of his &s;quadron. I con&s;ider my&s;elf, in executing this ta&s;k, as only performing a duty I owe to your Lord&s;hip, and which I do with the greater plea&s;ure, as it may po&s;&s;ibly be the means of making public a di&s;covery which &s;hould be univer&s;ally known; and as the only way in my power to bring forward the merit of tho&s;e Gentlemen, to who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance I have been particu|larly indebted for the fortunate i&s;&s;ue of this experi|ment, and from who&s;e reports I am enabled to pre|&s;ent your Lord&s;hip with an account of the manner in which it was conducted, and of the particular ef|fects it produced.</P>
<P>Mr. Menzies, late Surgeon to his Maje&s;ty's &s;loop the Di&s;covery, was the per&s;on who, at my reque&s;t, very obligingly undertook the management of the experiment on board the Union, and it is but doing him ju&s;tice to &s;ay, that I could not have found a gentleman better qualified, in every re&s;pect, for executing &s;o important a tru&s;t. I &s;hall therefore, my Lord, without farther preface, lay before you, and the re&s;t of their Lord&s;hips, Mr. Menzies's jour|nal, as affording a better de&s;cription of the experi|ment, &s;o long as he continued to conduct it, than any I can offer.</P>

<HEAD>REPORT OF THE EXPERIMENT FOR Stopping the Progre&s;s of Contagion, as executed on board the Union Ho&s;pital Ship, at Sheerne&s;s, by Mr. Arch. Menzies.</HEAD>
<P>DOCTOR James Carmichael Smyth having been reque&s;ted, by the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Admiralty, to &s;end a per&s;on on board the Union Ho&s;pital Ship, laying at Sheerne&s;s, to make trial of the effect of a fumigation of the Nitrous Acid, and of other means recommended by him in a late publi|cation, for de&s;troying Contagion, I readily engaged, upon application being made to me by &s;ome of our common friends, in the execution of an experiment which I fore&s;aw might eventually be of much benefit to &s;ociety, and particularly to that &s;ervice, to which I have the honor to belong.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="036328_0054_1008ECB2939A8E00">
After having, therefore, received in&s;tructions, and obtained every nece&s;&s;ary information on the manner of conducting the fumigation, I left London on the 24th of November, 1795, and arrived at Sheerne&s;s the &s;ame evening.</P>
<P>Next morning I waited on Admiral Buckner, the commanding officer of the port, who&s;e politene&s;s and zeal to promote the object of my journey, were equal|ly con&s;picuous, and de&s;erves my mo&s;t grateful ac|knowledgement.</P>
<P>I afterwards went on board the Union, where I produced the orders of the Admiralty to Lieutenant Quarme, the commanding officer, and Mr. Ba&s;&s;an, &s;urgeon of the &s;hip, who received me with cordiali|ty, and readily offered every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in their power to carry on the experiment, upon the event of which not only the &s;afety of the &s;hip's company, but per|haps, their own, in great mea&s;ure, depended.</P>
<P>On examining the &s;tate of the ho&s;pital, I plainly fore&s;aw that fre&s;h contagion would be daily pouring into it from the Ru&s;&s;ian ve&s;&s;els, under which di&s;ad|vantageous circum&s;tance, it would be difficult to de|cide on the &s;ucce&s;s of our endeavours. The lower and middle gun-decks were divided into large apart|ments, or wards, by cro&s;s partitions, with a free communication between each: they were extremely crouded, and the &s;ick of every de&s;cription lay in cradles, promi&s;cuou&s;ly arranged, to the number of nearly two hundred; of which about one hundred and fifty were in different &s;tages of a malignant fe|ver, extremely contagious, as appeared evident from its rapid progre&s;s, and fatal effects, among&s;t the at|tendants on the &s;ick, and the &s;hip's company. For, from the beginning of September la&s;t, when the Ru&s;&s;ian &s;ick were fir&s;t admitted into the ho&s;pital; eight nur&s;es and two wa&s;her-women had been at|tacked
<PB N="55" REF="036328_0055_1008ECAE88F36990">
with this fever, and of the&s;e three had died. About twenty-four of the &s;hip's company had like|wi&s;e been ill of the &s;ame di&s;order, and of the&s;e a &s;urgeon's mate and two marines died. Upon the whole, however, the mortality had not been &s;o great as there were rea&s;ons to dread, from the virulence of the contagion, and malignity of the di&s;ea&s;e; which can only be a&s;cribed to the great care and at|tention of Mr. Ba&s;&s;an, &s;urgeon to the ho&s;pital, who&s;e conduct in &s;o critical a &s;ituation does him the highe&s;t honor, and reflects lu&s;tre on his profe&s;&s;ional abilities, in the faithful di&s;charge of &s;o unplea&s;ant a duty.</P>
<P>After I returned on &s;hore from the Union, I em|ployed the re&s;t of the day in collecting and &s;ending on board &s;uch uten&s;ils and materials as were requir|ed for fumigating the &s;hip; the&s;e con&s;i&s;ted of a quan|tity of fine &s;and, about two dozen quart earthen pip|kins, and as many &s;mall common tea-cups, together with &s;ome long &s;lips of gla&s;s to be u&s;ed as &s;patulas; the other materials I had brought with me from town, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the concentrated vitriolic acid, and a quan|tity of pure nitre in powder.</P>
<P>On the forenoon of the twenty-&s;ixth, I went again on board the Union. I fir&s;t ordered all the ports and &s;cuttles to be clo&s;e &s;hut up; the &s;and, which had been previou&s;ly heated in iron pots, was then &s;cooped out into the pipkins by means of an iron ladle, and in this heated &s;and, in each pipkin, a &s;mall tea-cup was immer&s;ed, containing about half an ounce of concentrated vitriolic acid, to which, after it had acquired a proper degree of heat, an equal quantity of pure nitre in powder was gradually added, and the mixture &s;tirred with a gla&s;s &s;patula, until the va|pour aro&s;e from it in con&s;iderable quantity. The pipkins were then carried through the wards, by the nur&s;es and convale&s;cents, who kept walking about
<PB N="56" REF="036328_0056_1008ECB46A0FAF58">
with them in their hands, occa&s;ionally putting them under the cradles of the &s;ick, and in every corner where any foul air was &s;u&s;pected to lodge. In this manner we continued fumigating, until the whole &s;pace between decks was, fore and aft, filled with the vapour, which appeared like a thick haze.</P>
<P>I however proceeded in this fir&s;t trial &s;lowly and cautiou&s;ly, following with my eyes the pipkins in every direction, to watch the effect of the vapour on the &s;ick, and ob&s;erved that at fir&s;t it excited a good deal of coughing, but which gradually cea&s;ed, in proportion as it became more generally diffu&s;ed through the wards; this effect appeared indeed to be chiefly occa&s;ioned by the ignorance or inattention of tho&s;e who carried the pipkins, in putting them &s;ometimes too near to the faces of the &s;ick, by which means they &s;uddenly inhaled the &s;trong vapour, as it immediately i&s;&s;ued from the cups.</P>
<P>In compliance with Doctor Smyth's reque&s;t, the body-clothes and bed-clothes of the &s;ick were, as much as po&s;&s;ible, expo&s;ed to the nitrous vapour dur|ing the fumigation; and all the dirty linen removed from them was immediately immer&s;ed in a tub of cold water, afterwards carried on deck, rin&s;ed out, and hung up till nearly dry, and then fumigated be|fore it was taken to the wa&s;h-hou&s;e: a precaution extremely nece&s;&s;ary in every infectious di&s;order. Due attention was al&s;o paid to cleanline&s;s and ven|tilation.</P>
<P>As the people were at fir&s;t very awkward and &s;low, it took us about three hours to fumigate the &s;hip; in about an hour after, the vapour having entirely &s;ub&s;ided, the ports and &s;cuttles were thrown open, for the admi&s;&s;ion of fre&s;h air. I then walked through the wards, and plainly perceived that the
<PB N="57" REF="036328_0057_1008ECB7474CFCF0">
air of the ho&s;pital was greatly &s;weetened, even by this fir&s;t fumigation.</P>
<P>Next morning the &s;hip was again fumigated, be|ginning with the lower deck, and the people employ|ed being now better acquainted with the operation, were more expert, and fini&s;hed the whole in about an hour's time; in an hour afterwards, the vapour having entirely &s;ub&s;ided, the fre&s;h air was freely ad|mitted into the ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>This day the &s;and was made hotter, and the fumi|gation was of cour&s;e much &s;tronger, yet the patients &s;uffered no other inconvenience from it than a little coughing, and even that was not near &s;o general as the day before.</P>
<P>Twelve pipkins were found &s;ufficient for fumigat|ing the lower deck, ten for the middle gun deck, two for the &s;hip's company's bed-room, two for the marines' bed-room, and one for the wa&s;hing place; in all twenty-&s;even pipkins. Con&s;equently, about fourteen ounces of the vitriolic acid, and as much nitre, were expended in the forenoon; but, in the evening, as every place was &s;o clo&s;e, and the fre&s;h air could not be afterwards &s;o freely admitted, it was not thought nece&s;&s;ary to employ &s;o many pip|kins; &s;o that little more than half the quantity of the fumigating materials u&s;ed in the morning, was generally found &s;ufficient for the evening's fumiga|tion.</P>
<P>The plea&s;ing and immediate effect of the fumiga|tion, in de&s;troying the offen&s;ive and di&s;agreeable &s;mell ari&s;ing from &s;o many &s;ick crouded together, was now very perceptible, even to the nur&s;es and attendants. The con&s;equence of which was, that they now be|gan to place &s;ome degree of confidence in its effica|cy, and approached the cradles of the infected with le&s;s dread of being attacked with the di&s;order; &s;o
<PB N="58" REF="036328_0058_1008ECBA213115E8">
that the &s;ick were better attended, and the duty of the ho&s;pital was more regularly and more cheerfully performed. In &s;hort, a plea&s;ing gleam of hope &s;eem|ed now to ca&s;t its cheering influence, over that ge|neral de&s;pondency which was before evidently pic|tured in every countenance, from the dread and hor|ror each individual naturally entertained of being, perhaps, the next victim to the malignant powers of a virulent contagion.</P>
<P>On the twenty-eighth, the fumigation was repeat|ed morning and evening, in the &s;ame manner as on the preceding day, and with the &s;ame plea&s;ing effect, de&s;troying the offen&s;ive &s;mell, and purifying the ge|neral air of the ho&s;pital. But there was, in parti|cular places, a con&s;tant &s;ource of bad &s;mell, which was not ea&s;ily overcome, and which was occa&s;ioned by the <HI>nece&s;&s;aries.</HI> The&s;e were badly con&s;tructed, being placed within the &s;hip, to the number of &s;even on the lower deck, and two on the middle deck, with &s;mall funnels that pierced the &s;ides of the &s;hip in a &s;lanting direction, and generally retained the <HI>&s;oil,</HI> unle&s;s where a per&s;on con&s;tantly attended to wa&s;h it away, a very trouble&s;ome and dangerous office, which chiefly fell to the lot of the nur&s;es, and doubtle&s;s tended to &s;pread the contagion among&s;t them.</P>
<P>I mentioned this nui&s;ance to the commanding offi|cer, who told me that he viewed them in the &s;ame light, and that &s;ome alterations were making, which he hoped would remedy the evil. I therefore wait|ed a few days the event of the&s;e alterations, before I &s;hould make any public report on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>For the following eight days I continued the fu|migation on board the Union, regularly morning and evening, as already de&s;cribed, without ob&s;erving any particular occurrence different from what is already
<PB N="59" REF="036328_0059_1008ECBBB22D3AE8">
related, only that during this time, a con&s;iderable number of patients having been di&s;charged from the ho&s;pital, all the &s;pare cradles were ordered on deck, to be &s;crubbed and wa&s;hed with the diluted marine acid, according to the particular directions of Dr. Smyth.</P>
<P>On the &s;eventh of December, I re&s;igned to Mr. Ba&s;&s;an the further pro&s;ecution of the experiment on board the Union ho&s;pital &s;hip, but before I leave her, I mu&s;t &s;ay, that it has already produced the mo&s;t evident and beneficial effects, as not one of the attendants on the &s;ick, nor any of the &s;hip's company have been attacked with the di&s;order &s;ince I began the fumigation, with the exception of one nur&s;e, who &s;uffered a &s;light relap&s;e from &s;ome imprudence; an accident which Mr. Ba&s;&s;an informs me was very frequent in the beginning. And as none of the &s;ick, who have been brought to the ho&s;pital &s;ince my ar|rival, have died, it would &s;eem that the fumigation has not only le&s;&s;ened the danger of infection, but al&s;o the malignity of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The proce&s;s of fumigating as already de&s;cribed, with the <HI>nitrous acid,</HI> is &s;imple and ea&s;y, and al|though the vapour is extremely powerful and pene|trating, the &s;ick of every de&s;cription were ob&s;erved to bear it, with little or no apparent inconvenience, and to a much higher degree than I could have expected; and as it is found to purify the air from the di&s;agreeable effluvia, produced by &s;o many peo|ple crouded together in a confined &s;ituation, it will be peculiarly advantageous on board of &s;ickly &s;hips, where the crew, their clothes, and the &s;hip, may be fumigated at the &s;ame time without any ri&s;k from fire.</P>

<P>My propo&s;al was to remove all the <HI>nece&s;&s;aries</HI> from the in&s;ide, and have them rebuilt on the out|&s;ide of the &s;hip, and by cutting down the lower edge of the &s;ame number of port-holes, to form entrances into them from the ho&s;pital, by which they would be equally ea&s;y of acce&s;s to the &s;ick, and the nui&s;ance would be totally removed. This I was happy to find the carpenters were now exe|cuting, and I am confident it will be attended with beneficial effects, by rendering the ho&s;pital much &s;weeter, and con&s;equently more agreeable and healthy, both to the &s;ick and attendants.</P>

Mr. Menzies, as is already mentioned in his Journal, having, on the 7th of December, re&s;ign|ed to Mr. Ba&s;&s;an, &s;urgeon of the Union, the ma|nagement of the experiment, I mu&s;t refer your Lord&s;hip, for the further detail of this bu&s;ine&s;s, to extracts taken from his letters, &s;ome of which you have already &s;een, and which are now arranged according to the order of time in which they were written.</P>
<P>Mr. Ba&s;&s;an's conduct, my Lord, through the whole of this bu&s;ine&s;s, does him the highe&s;t honour, and cannot fail to recommend him to your Lord|&s;hip's notice. When the contagion at fir&s;t began to &s;pread among the &s;hip's company of the Union, he was importuned, by the warrant officers and others, to &s;end them on &s;hore to &s;ick quarters, which he peremptorily refu&s;ed, &s;aying, with the true &s;pirit of a Briti&s;h &s;ailor: <Q>It is better we &s;hould all peri&s;h, than have &s;uch a contagious fever as this di&s;&s;eminated in our fleet.</Q> He ac|cordingly made application to the Commander in Chief, and not a man was &s;ent out of the &s;hip. His humanity and care of the &s;ick, Mr. Menzies mentions in the warme&s;t terms of prai&s;e, and his &s;ucce&s;sful treatment of them, is the be&s;t te&s;timony of his profe&s;&s;ional abilities. His zeal and attention, in conducting the experiment, I &s;hall always recol|lect with gratitude. He and Mr. Menzies were both of them &s;trangers to me until this occa&s;ion brought us acquainted; but I mu&s;t &s;ay, that in the whole circle of my acquaintance, I could not have found two more liberal or candid men.</P>

<P>The fumigation is not attended with the &s;malle&s;t inconvenience to any one, the majority of patients being in bed when it is done, and all of them in the wards; the cabins of the nur&s;es, privies, &amp;c. are fumigated, as well as the apartments of the marines, and &s;hip's company. For two months prior to the experiment, very few days elap&s;ed without &s;ome of the attendants, or &s;hip's company being &s;eized with the fever; but &s;ince the 26th ultimo, the day on which Mr. Menzies began the fumigation, not one has been attacked with the di&s;ea&s;e; one nur&s;e only having relap&s;ed, a circum&s;tance very common, and occa&s;ioned by her not taking care of her&s;elf. I beg leave to inform you, that this day I began to take charge of the bu&s;ine&s;s, in the ab&s;ence of Mr. Men|zies, who is on board the Pamet Eu&s;taphia to try the experiment, (&s;he having been the mo&s;t &s;ickly &s;hip) where I am certain he will take &s;uch mea&s;ures, as will do him&s;elf credit, and you honour.</P>

The utility of the fumigation appears now very evident, as, notwith&s;tanding the great number of fever pa|tients brought into this ho&s;pital &s;hip, not one of the attendants, or &s;hip's company, have experienced the &s;lighte&s;t indi&s;po&s;ition &s;ince we fir&s;t began to employ it.&mdash;A very &s;atisfactory demon&s;tration of its power in de&s;troying contagion; indeed, Sir, I mo&s;t &s;incere|ly congratulate you on the &s;ucce&s;s of a di&s;covery, which promi&s;es to be of &s;uch eminent &s;ervice to &s;o|ciety.

The people bear it exceedingly well, and I frequently &s;tand in the mid&s;t of a cloud, ari&s;ing from the fumigation, as thick as a fog, with|out the &s;malle&s;t inconvenience, a circum&s;tance of great con&s;equence, as the &s;ick are all in the wards during the fumigation, and their clothes, &amp;c. are con&s;equently impregnated with the acid vapour.

<P>Since my la&s;t, one nur&s;e and one marine have been taken ill of the fever, although the &s;ymptoms are evidently milder than heretofore. As it is im|po&s;&s;ible to &s;ay how long contagion may remain in an infected per&s;on before it is put into action, I am not at all di&s;couraged by the&s;e two ca&s;es; but &s;hall continue every exertion in my power, in pro&s;ecuting the experiment, which has already been of &s;uch eminent utility.

of the fever.

la&s;t, otherwi&s;e than from the fumigation having been u&s;ed the preceding week, only once a day, or from their having been infected prior to the com|mencement of it, which I think is not impo&s;&s;ible. I am now determined to u&s;e it con&s;tantly twice a day, and have done &s;o &s;ince Tue&s;day la&s;t, the day on which the marine was attacked; be&s;ides, exclu|&s;ive of the general fumigation, I place a fumigating pot or two in the wards near the wor&s;t of the fever patients. The &s;ick not only bear the fumigation exceedingly well, but aid us voluntarily every day, the convale&s;cents carrying the pipkins about, and expre&s;&s;ing their conviction of its keeping the wards &s;weet, which certainly it does, and tho&s;e per&s;ons who have hitherto e&s;caped infection, are &s;o much convinced of its efficacy, and have &s;o much faith in its power, that I &s;hould find it difficult to di&s;con|tinue the u&s;e of it, whil&s;t there is a &s;ick man on board.

<P>I have the plea&s;ure to inform you, that the con|tagion &s;eems now to be totally extinct, no one hav|ing been attacked with the fever &s;ince the 26th of December la&s;t, and only two &s;ince the 26th of November, the time when the fumigation was be|gun; one of the&s;e a marine, who, ten days previ|ous to his being taken ill, had con&s;tantly drank very hard, and was often drunk; the other a nur&s;e, who was very &s;lightly attacked, and both, in my opinion, might have received the infection long be|fore it was put into action, as from their duty they were con&s;tantly expo&s;ed to the contagion when it was fir&s;t brought into the &s;hip; and this is rendered &s;till more probable, as there have been &s;everal arti|ficers at work, making the alteration in the privies, and of cour&s;e among&s;t the &s;ick, and likewi&s;e a fre&s;h nur&s;e, a young woman immediately employed in the fever ward, none of whom have received the &s;malle&s;t injury. I therefore now con&s;ider the expe|riment as complete, and can bring &s;ufficient evidence to convince any one that the contagion in the ho&s;pi|tal, on board the Union, has, through Divine pro|vidence, been de&s;troyed by the fumigation you re|commended:

be&s;ides, as the acid vapour keeps the &s;hip &s;weet, it is my intention to continue it for that purpo&s;e con&s;tantly, if I am permitted &s;o to do.

<HEAD>REPORT OF THE EXPERIMENT FOR Stopping the Progre&s;s of Contagion, as executed on board &s;ome of the Ru&s;&s;ian Men of War, by Mr. Arch. Menzies.</HEAD>
<P>SOON after my arrival at Sheerne&s;s, I had the honor of being introduced to his Excellency Admi|ral Hannikow, Commander of the Ru&s;&s;ian &s;quadron at that port, on which occa&s;ion he was plea&s;ed to expre&s;s a particular de&s;ire of having the mo&s;t &s;ickly &s;hips of his &s;quadron purified by the &s;ame proce&s;s of fumigation, as I was then carrying on, on board the Union ho&s;pital &s;hip. This being made known to the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Admiralty, they were plea&s;ed to declare their approbation, by re|que&s;ting Admiral Buckner to confer with his Ex|cellency on this &s;ubject: and on the twenty-eighth
<PB N="71" REF="036328_0071_1008ECE6D7647AC8">
of November, it was agreed between the&s;e Com|manders, that the fumigation &s;hould be tried, under my directions, on board &s;uch of the Ru&s;&s;ian ve&s;&s;els as were then mo&s;t infected with the contagious fe|ver, which had already proved &s;o fatal to many of their crews; and it is but ju&s;tice to &s;ay, that his Excellency, on this occa&s;ion, &s;hewed a particular zeal for its &s;ucce&s;s, by offering me every aid and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and by a&s;&s;uring me of a ready compli|ance, with every means that might be &s;ugge&s;ted to accompli&s;h &s;o de&s;irable an object, as the health and pre&s;ervation of tho&s;e under his command. But it &s;o happened, that, on the day following, he was ordered, with part of his &s;quadron, to the North Seas, and in this &s;tate of hurry, not having time to con&s;ider which was the mo&s;t &s;ickly ve&s;&s;el, he left orders for the trial to be made on board the Revel frigate; but on examining the ho&s;pital books on board the Union, the Pamet Eu&s;taphia, of 74 guns, appeared to claim our fir&s;t attention, from her &s;ickly &s;tate: I therefore waited on Admiral Buckner, to acquaint him with this circum&s;tance, and he very readily applied to Capt. Chechagoff, on whom the command of the remaining part of the Ru&s;&s;ian &s;quadron had devolved, and obtained his leave for the trial to be made on board of her, in preference to the other. After this, &s;ome un|avoidable delay was occa&s;ioned, in waiting for the materials, and collecting together the uten&s;ils ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the operation.</P>
<P>In the forenoon of the &s;eventh of December, 1795, I went on board the Pamet Eu&s;taphia, and having ordered the ports, &s;cuttles, and hatchways to be clo&s;e &s;hut up, with the &s;hip's company be|tween decks, we fumigated her for the fir&s;t time, and continued it morning and evening on the fol|lowing
<PB N="72" REF="036328_0072_1008ECE99AFF06A8">
day, in the &s;ame manner that we had done the Union ho&s;pital &s;hip.</P>
<P>This &s;hip has of late &s;ent more &s;ick with the ma|lignant fever to the ho&s;pital, than all the re&s;t taken together, of the Ru&s;&s;ian &s;quadron laying at this port, which her Commander, Capt. Sinavin, attributes in a great mea&s;ure to her &s;hingle balla&s;t being chiefly compo&s;ed of &s;and, intermixed with a large portion of wet earth, that keeps up a con&s;tant moi&s;ture and dampne&s;s below, in &s;pite of every means of venti|lation: add to this the putrid &s;tench, ari&s;ing in &s;o clo&s;e and crouded a &s;ituation from the <HI>&s;hubs</HI> or &s;heep-&s;kin great-coats, which are generally worn by the Ru&s;&s;ian &s;eamen, with the woolly &s;ide next their body, and which undoubtedly mu&s;t aid to nouri&s;h the &s;eeds of contagion, and increa&s;e its virulence.</P>
<P>I repre&s;ented to &s;everal of the Commanders of the Ru&s;&s;ian men of war, the nece&s;&s;ity there was of de&s;troying, or at lea&s;t of &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the&s;e <HI>&s;hubs</HI> in this country, for though they might be very com|fortable, and an&s;wer pretty well in dry, cold, fro&s;ty weather, &s;uch as is generally the ca&s;e in long win|ters in Ru&s;&s;ia, yet they were by no means calculated for the chilly wet weather which generally prevail|ed in this country; as in a damp &s;tate they never fail to impregnate the air with offen&s;ive putrid efflu|via, that mu&s;t be extremely hurtful to people's con&s;titution where it is con&s;tantly breathed by &s;o many crowded together in &s;uch a confined &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Early on the morning of the ninth, the Pamet Eu&s;taphia, with the Ratvezan of 66 guns, were removed up to Chatham, in con&s;equence of which it was not in my power to continue the fumigation, though I went there on purpo&s;e. And on the fol|lowing day, the crew was &s;o bu&s;ily occupied, in unrigging the &s;hip, and clearing her of &s;tores and
<PB N="73" REF="036328_0073_1008ECEB26B27A98">
provi&s;ion, to prepare her for going into dock, that no time could be &s;pared to attend to the fumigation, until that duty was accompli&s;hed; which as it would take up &s;ome days, and as her people were then to be put on board a receiving &s;hip, while &s;he was in dock, (a circum&s;tance I con&s;idered as very unfavour|able to the experiment) I therefore came to London on the eleventh, to con&s;ult with Doctor Carmichael Smyth, what plan was be&s;t to pur&s;ue; for as this was the only Ru&s;&s;ian ve&s;&s;el from which a fair e&s;ti|mate could be drawn of the utility and efficacy of the fumigation, I was anxious to continue it, in whatever manner might be thought mo&s;t likely to &s;ecure &s;ucce&s;s in de&s;troying the contagion, or le&s;&s;en|ing its malignity.</P>
<P>I returned to Chatham again on the fourteenth, with orders to fumigate as many of the Ru&s;&s;ian ve&s;&s;els, e&s;pecially &s;uch as were mo&s;t &s;ickly, as I po&s;|&s;ibly could; for though the experiment could not be regularly carried on, yet in this manner it might le&s;&s;en the virulence of the di&s;order, and dimini&s;h the number of &s;ick &s;ent to the ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>Next day I waited on Captain Chechagoff and Capt. Sinavin, and found that their ve&s;&s;els were not yet cleared of their &s;tores, &amp;c. &s;o that I could not go on with either. Indeed, the Ratvezan was pretty healthy, her Commander, Cap. Chechagoff, being very attentive to every means of purifying his ve&s;&s;el by ventilation and cleanline&s;s, and by de&s;troy|ing and &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the <HI>&s;hubs,</HI> as far as he po&s;&s;ibly could; for he told me, he could not do them away altogether, without giving the men other clothing <HI>in lieu,</HI> which mu&s;t be done by an order from the Commander in Chief.</P>
<P>Captain Chechagoff al&s;o informed me, that the Pimen, of 66 guns, was arrived at Sheerne&s;s, which
<PB N="74" REF="036328_0074_1008ECEE9938BDC8">
had &s;ome time ago been &s;o very &s;ickly, that boats from other ve&s;&s;els were forbid coming along-&s;ide of her, from a dread of the infection; he therefore expre&s;&s;ed his de&s;ire of having her well fumigated; and I immediately &s;et out to execute his reque&s;t.</P>
<P>On the &s;ixteenth of December, I fumigated the Pimen for the fir&s;t time. Her crew, however, was nowi&s;e &s;ickly now, although on vi&s;iting her between deck, before the fumigation, the &s;tench produced by the <HI>&s;hubs</HI> was very perceptible, and extremely offen&s;ive; and it was plea&s;ing to ob&s;erve the &s;udden change produced by the powers of the nitrous va|pour in de&s;troying it.</P>
<P>When I went on board, on the following day, to continue the fumigation, I found the officers and crew attending Divine Service, and the Prie&s;ts &s;prinkling the decks with Holy-water, &s;o I did not intrude; but left orders with their own &s;urgeon, to fumigate the &s;hip in the evening, if he could con|veniently, which he did. As this was a holiday among&s;t them, I al&s;o declined calling on board the Revel frigate till the next day, when, after fumigat|ing the Pimen, I went on board the Revel, to re|que&s;t them to prepare for fumigating her. On vi&s;iting this ve&s;&s;el between decks, I found the pu|trid &s;tench from the <HI>&s;hubs</HI> extremely offen&s;ive and di&s;agreeable from the confined air, and want of ventilation; and I had great difficulty to make my|&s;elf under&s;tood, or give any particular directions for want of an interpreter.</P>
<P>The nineteenth was &s;o boi&s;terous that I could not get on board either ve&s;&s;el, but the Surgeon of the Pimen was &s;o good as to continue the fumi|gation as u&s;ual. Captain Colokol&s;off, the Com|mander of this ve&s;&s;el, was extremely civil, and well di&s;po&s;ed to promote my endeavours; and the princi|pal
<PB N="75" REF="036328_0075_1008ECF21F77AA00">
officers were equally polite and ready to &s;ee my directions executed on all occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>Next day I vi&s;ited the Pimen, which was now quite free from &s;tench or any offen&s;ive &s;mell, in con&s;equence of the fumigation having been regular|ly continued. I al&s;o began to fumigate the Revel frigate, and regularly attended both ve&s;&s;els, for the three following days; after which I left the mate|rials and uten&s;ils on board them, with directions to their own Surgeons to continue it in the &s;ame way daily.</P>
<P>From what information I could collect, the Re|vel had not been very &s;ickly, yet the few &s;he had lately &s;ent to the ho&s;pital, were malignant fevers, which clearly &s;hewed that the contagion was lurk|ing on board her, though it did not &s;pread with much violence.</P>
<P>Being particularly anxious to re&s;ume the experi|ment on board the Pamet Eu&s;taphia, &s;he being the mo&s;t &s;ickly, and on that account claiming more parti|cular attention, I came up to Chatham on the twen|ty-fourth, and found &s;he had been ju&s;t hauled into dock, and her crew put on board the Prince Ed|ward receiving &s;hip, where they were very much crouded. On the following day I began the fumi|gation, but as many of the ports and hatchways of the &s;hip could not be &s;hut clo&s;e enough to retain the vapour for a &s;ufficient length of time, a quick and &s;trong fumigation became more e&s;&s;entially ne|ce&s;&s;ary; which, however, I could not get them to execute, not being able to make them under&s;tand my meaning, for want of a &s;ufficient knowledge of their language.</P>
<P>The fumigation was, notwith&s;tanding, continued regularly on board this &s;hip for the four following days, although it was not in my power to prevail
<PB N="76" REF="036328_0076_1008ECF6833EDF20">
on them to do it &s;ufficiently &s;trong, to do ju&s;tice to the trial,&mdash;and to in&s;ure that &s;ucce&s;s we had already experienced on board the Union; their excu&s;e ge|nerally was, that the fire was too much occupied to get a &s;ufficient quantity of &s;and heated.</P>
<P>But, as it was po&s;&s;ible, that even this &s;light fu|migation might &s;ucceed by long continuance, and as their own Surgeon was now acquainted with the proce&s;s, and well di&s;po&s;ed to carry it on, I left the materials and uten&s;ils on board; and, before my departure, waited on Captain Sinavin, who, at this time, lived on &s;hore, and who (after being ac|quainted with the foregoing circum&s;tances) &s;aid that he &s;hould order it to be continued while his &s;hip's company were anywi&s;e &s;ickly.</P>
<P>The Ratvezan having likewi&s;e gone into dock; to prevent her crew becoming &s;ickly on board the receiving &s;hip, I, at Captain Chechagoff's particu|lar reque&s;t, &s;ent uten&s;ils and materials on board to fumigate daily.</P>
<P>Having now put the&s;e Ru&s;&s;ian ve&s;&s;els in a fair train for continuing the fumigation; and finding that my pre&s;ence, on account of my ignorance of their language, could not be of any further &s;ervice; at the &s;ame time, &s;ome urgent bu&s;ine&s;s, of our late voyage, pre&s;&s;ing hard upon me, I returned to town on the thirtieth of December, leaving the further pro&s;ecution of the experiment, as above related, to be conducted by their own Surgeons; and I have the mo&s;t plea&s;ing hopes that it will be attend|ed with beneficial effects to her Imperial Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, not only in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, but in every &s;imilar &s;ituation hereafter.</P>

<P>Having now, my Lord, fini&s;hed with the account of the experiment given by the two gentlemen who have been employed in conducting it, permit me, be|fore concluding the &s;ubject, to call for a moment your Lord&s;hip's attention to &s;ome of the principal circum&s;tances, and to the conclu&s;ions which they afford.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, my Lord, it mu&s;t be allowed that the pre&s;ent experiment fully ju&s;tifies all I have &s;aid re&s;pecting the &s;afety with which the nitrous acid (procured in the manner de&s;cribed) may be employed as a fumigation. No one &s;urely can &s;ay that I a&s;&s;ume too much, when I con&s;ider the &s;afety of the fumigation as e&s;tabli&s;hed, after a trial of nearly three months, for an hour and a half or two hours, morning and evening, each day, on board an ho&s;pital &s;hip, containing from two to three hun|dred per&s;ons of different &s;exes, and ages, and la|bouring under different di&s;ea&s;es; without a &s;ingle in&s;tance of permanent inconvenience or bad con&s;e|quence ari&s;ing from it: for the &s;light cough, which it at fir&s;t excited, and which was evidently owing to the aukwardne&s;s and ignorance of tho&s;e who carried the fumigating pipkins, cannot be looked upon as &s;uch, and no farther inconvenience has ever been felt by any one on board.</P>
<P>Having e&s;tabli&s;hed then this important fact, that the nitrous acid is attended with no ri&s;k to the health or &s;afety of the people expo&s;ed to it, let me next claim your Lord&s;hip's attention to the &s;en&s;ible and immediate effects of it.</P>
<P>We are told by Mr. Menzies, that after the fir&s;t fumigation, and &s;till more remarkably after the &s;e|cond, the air of the ho&s;pital was perceived to be purer, and free from any putrid or offen&s;ive &s;mell; the&s;e immediate effects of the fumigation, are like|wi&s;e
<PB N="78" REF="036328_0078_1008ECFB4D896C70">
repeatedly mentioned by Mr. Ba&s;&s;an, the la&s;t of them indeed was too &s;triking not to be taken notice of by every per&s;on on board. That the va|pour of the nitrous acid &s;hould be found to de&s;troy an offen&s;ive &s;mell, the effect of animal exhalations, I was not &s;urpri&s;ed at, having my&s;elf had repeated experience of the fact; but that it would al&s;o ren|der the air purer and more proper for re&s;piration, I was by no means certain, until I found the repeat|ed ob&s;ervations of tho&s;e Gentlemen, confirmed by the evidence of Mr. Keir, of Birmingham, one of the fir&s;t chemi&s;ts in this country, or perhaps in Europe; an extract of a letter from this gentleman, whom I have not the honor to know per&s;onally, to a friend of his in town, I have &s;ubjoined for your Lord&s;hip's &s;atisfaction, as it affords a convincing proof, from chemi&s;try, of the truth of what Mr. Menzies and Mr. Ba&s;&s;an ob&s;erved in practice. The&s;e two qualities, my Lord, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the rendering the atmo&s;pheric air purer, and con&s;equently fitter for the purpo&s;es of animal life, and the completely de&s;troying the offen&s;ive &s;mell re&s;ulting from animal effluvia or putrid matter, are, of them&s;elves, con|&s;iderable advantages, if no others were to be ex|pected or derived from the fumigation; but they are of &s;till higher importance, when con&s;idered as pre&s;umptive evidence of the power of the nitrous vapour to de&s;troy contagion; for whatever is found to de&s;troy the &s;mell of putridity, and at the &s;ame time to render the air purer, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e more or le&s;s conducive to this grand object. But pre|&s;umptive evidence, on a &s;ubject of this importance, in which the lives of thou&s;ands are involved, is not &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy the mind; and happily for man|kind, the pre&s;ent experiment, in&s;tituted under your
<PB N="79" REF="036328_0079_1008ECFE2DBE3C50">
Lord&s;hip's au&s;pices, affords complete and direct evi|dence of the fact.</P>
<P>But to bring this home to the under&s;tanding and conviction of all mankind, it is only nece&s;&s;ary to look with attention, at the annexed Ho&s;pital Re|turn; for by comparing the &s;tate of health of the &s;hip's company, with the progre&s;s and effects of the contagion, before and after the experiment was be|gun, a clear and decided judgment may be formed of its effects, even by the mo&s;t ignorant. They will in the fir&s;t place ob&s;erve, that from the 3d of September (the day the Ru&s;&s;ians, ill of the fever, were fir&s;t brought on board) to the fir&s;t of October, there were nine per&s;ons &s;eized with the di&s;temper, one of whom only belonged to the &s;hip's com|pany; the others were attendants on the &s;ick. That in the month of October, eight per&s;ons more were attacked with the di&s;ea&s;e, and of tho&s;e three belonged to the &s;hip's company. But, that from the fir&s;t of November, to the 26th of that month, twelve per&s;ons were attacked with the di&s;ea&s;e, among whom we find eight belonging to the &s;hip's company. From this &s;hort &s;tatement it is evident, that the contagion which was at fir&s;t chiefly confined to the ho&s;pital, affecting tho&s;e only who were imme|diately employed about the &s;ick, had gradually &s;pread over the &s;hip, and been communicated to the &s;hip's company; by which means the &s;ickne&s;s and mortality had increa&s;ed: and the probability is, that had not a &s;top been put to it, it would have gone on increa&s;ing in proportion to the diffu|&s;ion of the contagion, and to the increa&s;ing de&s;pon|dency of the people, who con&s;idered them&s;elves as &s;o many devoted victims. The whole number of per&s;ons &s;eized with the di&s;temper, during the fir&s;t three months that it prevailed on board the &s;hip,
<PB N="80" REF="036328_0080_1008ED021FDAC130">
was thirty (be&s;ides &s;ix children) which was more than one-third of all the people in the &s;hip, who were only eighty-five, officers included. Of the thirty &s;eized with the fever, eight died of the im|mediate effects of it, a large proportion &s;urely, be|ing not much le&s;s than one in three, and which &s;ufficiently marks the malignity of the di&s;temper.</P>
<P>Having taken a view of the &s;tate of the &s;hip's company, and of the progre&s;s of the contagion be|fore the experiment, let us now, my Lord, turn to the other &s;ide of the picture, and &s;ee what was the &s;ituation of things after the fumigation was begun.</P>
<P>On the 26th of November, the &s;hip was fumigat|ed for the fir&s;t time, and from that day to the 25th of December, not a per&s;on on board was attacked with the fever, their de&s;pondency was now chang|ed into joy, and their fear into confidence; but as very great confidence is always dangerous, it prov|ed &s;o in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance. On the 17th of De|cember, they imagined them&s;elves &s;o &s;ecure, that they di&s;continued the cu&s;tom of fumigating the &s;hip morning and evening, thinking that once a day was &s;ufficient; the trial, perhaps, was worth hazard|ing, but on the 25th of December, one of the nur&s;es &s;uffered a &s;light attack, and on the 26th, a marine, who for a week preceding had been in a &s;tate of intoxication, was &s;eized with the fever, of which he died. The&s;e two accidents gave immedi|ate alarm; they returned again to the practice of fumigating twice a day, and from that time to the end of the di&s;order, there has not been an in&s;tance of a per&s;on &s;uffering from contagion on board the &s;hip. But the advantage of the fumigation was not felt by the &s;hip's company and attendants alone, whom it pre&s;erved from the baneful effects of the fever, the &s;ick and convale&s;cents derived almo&s;t an
<PB N="81" REF="036328_0081_1008ED03AE95A4D8">
equal benefit from it. The &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e (as Mr. Ba&s;&s;an expre&s;&s;es it) were meliorated, and lo&s;t much of their malignant appearance, and the advantage of a pure air, and free from &s;tench, to convale&s;cents, may readily be conceived.</P>
<P>From the above relation, my Lord, it plainly appears, that whil&s;t the practice of fumigating the &s;hip twice in the twenty-four hours was continued, there was no &s;ymptom of contagion or of di&s;ea&s;e, and that the only two accidents which happened from the commencement of the experiment, to the pre&s;ent hour, occurred on the 25th and 26th of December, nine or ten days after they had cea&s;ed to fumigate the &s;hip, in the manner I had directed. The attack of&punc; the nur&s;e, indeed, was but trifling, and I think it not improbable that the fever, as well as the death of the marine, were the con&s;equence of his own intemperance; at any rate &s;uppo&s;ing both the one and the other to have &s;uffered from contagion, the&s;e ca&s;es do not in the lea&s;t invalidate the general &s;ucce&s;s of the experiment, and only prove, that in a &s;ituation where contagion is con|&s;tantly generated, it requires to be as con&s;tantly de&s;troyed; otherwi&s;e it is ready at every in&s;tant, like the hydra, to rear again its pe&s;tilential head.</P>
<P>But, my Lord, the &s;ucce&s;s of the experiment has not been confined to the Union, the power of the nitrous vapour to de&s;troy contagion, has been equal|ly di&s;played on board tho&s;e Ru&s;&s;ian ve&s;&s;els where it has been employed.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip mu&s;t have ob&s;erved, in Mr. Men|zies's Journal, the many unexpected delays he met with in the execution of this bu&s;ine&s;s. The &s;udden departure of the Ru&s;&s;ian Admiral, with a con&s;idera|ble part of the fleet, before the &s;hips, the mo&s;t
<PB N="82" REF="036328_0082_1008ED0693F74C30">
proper for the experiment, were fixed upon; Mr. Menzies beginning, in con&s;equence of not being properly informed, with &s;hips where the fumigation was not &s;o immediately nece&s;&s;ary; afterwards when he began to fumigate the Pamet Eu&s;taphia, which had &s;ent more &s;ick to the ho&s;pital than any &s;hip of the fleet, &s;he was immediately ordered into dock, and the crew turned over into a receiving &s;hip, a &s;ituation extremely di&s;advantageous for &s;uch an expe|riment: not to mention the various difficulties and ob&s;tacles ari&s;ing from the difference of language, u&s;ages, religious ceremonies, &amp;c. &s;ufficient to have di&s;couraged a man of a le&s;s firm mind, or who was le&s;s zealous than Mr. Menzies in pur&s;uing his ob|ject. He per&s;evered, however, for &s;ome time, but at la&s;t was under the nece&s;&s;ity of returning to town, and of leaving the farther pro&s;ecution of this bu&s;i|ne&s;s to the Ru&s;&s;ians them&s;elves; and yet, my Lord, owing to the good &s;en&s;e and proper conduct of their officers, who, convinced of the advantage of the fumigation, continued the daily practice of it; tho&s;e &s;hips that have been fumigated, are free from con|tagion, and particularly the Pamet Eu&s;taphia which was the mo&s;t &s;ickly, is now one of the healthie&s;t of the fleet, and has no appearance of contagion on board, nor a man ill of the fever; and &s;o great is the opinion entertained by Admiral Han|nicoff, of the efficacy of the fumigation, that he lately &s;ent to town for materials for fumigating &s;ome more &s;hips.</P>
<P>Such, my Lord, has been the re&s;ult of an expe|riment, by which &s;ome lives have been already &s;a|ved, and from which two important facts are clear|ly e&s;tabli&s;hed, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the power of the nitrous acid to de&s;troy contagion; and the &s;afety with which it may
<PB N="83" REF="036328_0083_1008ED0881D03FA8">
be employed in any &s;ituation, without inconveni|ence or ri&s;k of fire.</P>
<P>It would be, perhaps, improper in me to detain your Lord&s;hip any longer on this &s;ubject, by en|deavouring to point out the importance and exten|&s;ive application of the pre&s;ent di&s;covery; a di&s;cove|ry equally applicable to every &s;pecies of putrid con|tagion, even to the plague it&s;elf; a di&s;covery there|fore, in which all nations are more or le&s;s intere&s;ted, but who&s;e utility mu&s;t be mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly felt by our own; where a commerce, extended to every quar|ter of the globe, covers the &s;ea with our &s;hips, whil&s;t our gallant navy &s;till maintains the decided empire of it.</P>

From the above return it appears, that the num|ber of per&s;ons ill of the contagious fever, brought on board the Union, the two la&s;t months, De|cember 1795 and January 1796, were nearly equal to the number received the two preceding months, October and November.

<OPENER><DATELINE><DATE><HI>January</HI> 25, 1796.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>I CONSIDER Dr. Carmichael Smyth's di&s;covery to be very valuable. The fumes in his proce&s;s are quite different from the ordinary nitrous vapour in the di&s;tillation of aqua fortis, or from that which exhales in the &s;olution of metals, by nitrous acid; the latter is highly &s;uffocating and noxious, and may be called the phlogi&s;ticated nitrous acid vapour. The fumes made in Dr. Smyth's manner (if there is no metal employed in the ve&s;&s;el, &amp;c.) is highly de|phlogi&s;ticated or oxygenated nitrous vapour, and is al&s;o mixed with a large quantity of pure dephlogi|&s;ticated air, which is extricated from the materials, and the&s;e fumes are not only not &s;uffocating, but have a very plea&s;ant &s;mell. If the di&s;tinction is not made between the&s;e two kinds of vapour, it is to be feared that &s;ome per&s;on, by accident, or in ex|pectation of getting nitrous vapour more expe|ditiou&s;ly, may u&s;e the metal ve&s;&s;els, or di&s;&s;olve me|tals in nitrous acid.</P>

<HEAD>Extract of another Letter from Mr. Keir, dated near Birmingham, March 3, 1796.</HEAD>
<P>The difference between the white nitrous acid, (called by Dr. Prie&s;tley, dephlogi&s;ticated acid, and by the French chemi&s;ts, acide nitrique;) and the red acid, called phlogi&s;ticated, or acide nitreux, is well known, and was fir&s;t particularly noticed by Scheele, who &s;hews how the one may be &s;eparated from the other by di&s;tillation. There is the &s;ame difference in the colour of the vapours from the&s;e two acids; and Dr. C. Smyth has him&s;elf ob&s;erved, that the vapours, in the di&s;tillation of nitrous acid, were not noxious; which ob&s;ervation he has very happily and u&s;efully applied. In di&s;tilling the ni|trous acid from very &s;mall quantities of nitre and oil of vitriol, in gla&s;s ve&s;&s;els, and when the materials are very pure, I have &s;een nothing but the white va|pours, &s;uch as ari&s;e in Dr. C. Smyth's proce&s;s, but Scheele &s;ays, that at the end of the operation, &s;ome red vapours, ri&s;e, and it may be the ca&s;e when a ve|ry &s;trong heat is applied. But the very noxious red fumes which appear in the u&s;ual proce&s;s of di&s;tilling aqua fortis, are occa&s;ioned, as you mention, by the iron ve&s;&s;els; and the manufacturers even put in old nails and &s;mall pieces of iron into their pots, in order to give a high degree of red &s;moking quality to the acid. When you acquainted me of Dr. C. Smyth's di&s;covery, it occurred to me, that as the common notion of nitrous acid vapours, is confined to tho&s;e that are red, &s;ome people might, in the fir&s;t place, be prejudiced again&s;t it, from the idea of the vapours being noxious; as the red vapours are undoubtedly, and others might think that they made the proce&s;s more effectual, by adding to Dr. C. Smyth's mixture, metals, or inflammable &s;ub|&s;tances,
<PB N="91" REF="036328_0091_1008ED1ACF8BF330">
in order to produce tho&s;e red vapours. I therefore thought it would be proper for Dr. C. Smyth, to point out the difference between the va|pours produced in his method, and the red nitrous fumes which are &s;o well known; and al&s;o to caution the operators to avoid metal ve&s;&s;els, or the addition of metals or inflammable &s;ub&s;tances.</P>
<P>There is a good deal of vital air extricated from the mixture, but I cannot agree with tho&s;e who at|tribute the medicinal effect to it, we know little of this &s;ubject; but the analogy of the de&s;truction of all animal and vegetable fermentation by mineral acids, which is well a&s;certained, inclines me to be|lieve the agency of the acid, in the de&s;truction of the contagion. The matter of which is, I pre&s;ume, animal, in &s;ome vicious kind of fermentation.</P>

<P>It has been ob&s;erved that the fumigation, with the nitrous acid, introduced by Mr. Menzies on board the &s;hip Pamet Eu&s;taphia, has produced, in a &s;hort time, the be&s;t effect in &s;topping the pro|gre&s;s of the fever and other evils, which were then evidently increa&s;ing, for which rea&s;on it was not only regularly continued on board of that &s;hip, even after Mr. Menzies's departure, but adopted on board of others, and always found u&s;eful.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LAST winter, while I had charge of Forton ho&s;|pital, although in the mid&s;t of very fatiguing duty, and engaged, as I was, in making &s;ome favourite experiments of my own, yet, being extremely anxi|ous to acquire &s;ome practical knowledge of Doctor J. C. Smyth's nitrous vapour, I failed not, after re|ceiving your authority, to put his fumigating plan in execution, as exten&s;ively as it was po&s;&s;ible; nor, at the &s;ame time, to note down the phaenomena, as they occurred, with as much accuracy as my lei&s;ure time would permit. And now, in order that you may &s;ee, in the faire&s;t points of view, &s;ome of the effects of the vapour re&s;ulting from that highly in|genious, and very &s;alutary proce&s;s; and al&s;o, with the view no le&s;s of doing ju&s;tice to Doctor J. C. Smyth, than of rendering his nitrous vapour more exten&s;ively u&s;eful, in the Navy, Army, &amp;c. I beg leave to communicate to you the contents of the fol|lowing pages; which, &s;hould they appear to you in any degree calculated to be &s;erviceable, in promot|ing the welfare of the&s;e realms, I humbly reque&s;t you will be plea&s;ed to lay them before the Right Honourable the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners of Admiralty.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uing my pre&s;ent plan, I &s;hall, after giving you a &s;hort, but not imperfect account of the method I followed in fumigating the wards of the ho&s;pital, &s;tate, in a faithful manner, &s;uch facts, whether of a general, or of a particular nature, as aro&s;e from the trials that were made; after which, by mo&s;t humbly offering a few ob&s;ervations connected with the &s;ub|ject, I &s;hall conclude my letter.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="036328_0096_1008ED2894CDAB18">
Every evening a certain number of wards were fumigated, each by means of three pipkins, for an hour; the gally-pot in each pipkin containing the quantities of pure nitre in powder, and concentrat|ed vitriolic acid as directed by Doctor Smyth.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For a more particular hi&s;tory of the proce&s;s Vide, Doc|tor J. C. Smyth's letter to the Right Hon. Earl Spencer, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. containing an account of the experiment made on board the Union ho&s;pital &s;hip, to determine the effect of the nitrous acid in de&s;troying contagion, &amp;c.</NOTE> Three per&s;ons, each carrying one fuming pipkin, went round a ward, following one another at &s;ome di&s;tance, and holding the pipkins under each bed, for a con&s;iderable time, as they went along; and they continued doing &s;o as long as the fumigation la&s;ted. The wards, by opening the windows and doors, were afterwards filled with atmo&s;pheric air.</P>
<P>The vapour, proceeding from the decompo&s;ition of the nitre, by means of the concentrated vitriolic acid, was in &s;uch great quantity, that a ward 57 feet by 20, and 10 feet 6 inches high, was filled with it, by means of three pipkins, in the manner I have mentioned, in the &s;pace of fifteen minutes.</P>
<P>On the wards being filled with nitrous vapour, &s;ome of the patients who laboured under affections of the lungs were &s;eized with fits of coughing; none of them, however, to any great degree. With little or no exception, the patients, in the wards that were fumigated, bore the vapour without feeling any di&s;|agreeable effect from it. If, indeed, a pipkin was, accidentally, held very clo&s;e to the mouths of any of the patients, which, from awkwardne&s;s, was &s;ome|times the ca&s;e, coughing was immediately produced; and, in one in&s;tance, vomiting was occa&s;ioned. The&s;e circum&s;tances, however, did not prevent the patients from becoming, in a &s;hort time, very fond
<PB N="99" REF="036328_0097_1008ED2A22A5DF80">
of the fumigating bu&s;ine&s;s. For my part, I frequent|ly remained in a ward during the whole time of the fumigation, often indeed with a fuming pipkin in my hand, without experiencing any di&s;agreeable ef|fect whatever. The fume was to me plea&s;ant. When, during the fumigation, I remained in a ward, I al|ways wore black clothes, which, even, after being repeatedly expo&s;ed to the nitrous vapour, were not in the lea&s;t either &s;tained, or changed from black to a brown colour.</P>
<P>In the mornings, particularly in dry weather, the wards that had been fumigated the preceding even|ing, even although they had been wa&s;hed early in the morning, and the windows kept open, had a very agreeable &s;mell, much more plea&s;ant than that which was experienced during the fumigation. By this agreeable odour, in the mornings, I was able to judge whether or not due pains had been be&s;tow|ed, the preceding evening, in fumigating the wards.</P>
<P>One dy&s;entery ward, one fever ward, and one &s;urgery ward, containing the wor&s;t kind of Ulcers, were, at fir&s;t, the places filled every evening with the nitrous vapour; but, as the good effects re&s;ulting from the fumigation were to me very obvious, I &s;oon u&s;ed it more exten&s;ively. The patients, in general, who laboured under old dy&s;enteries, many of them contracted in the We&s;t Indies, &s;eemed to be greatly relieved;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ultimately, a great number of the old dy&s;enteries, where the patients were not far advanced in life, did well.</NOTE> the fevers, which were of no uncommon genus, and which were in their nature very mild, &s;oon di&s;appeared, without exhibiting any &s;ymptoms of typhus; and the ulcers, in&s;tead of further dege|nerating or &s;preading, put on a favourable appear|ance, and healed.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="036328_0098_1008ED2DB16829B0">
It is, I pre&s;ume, of no &s;mall con&s;equence to ob|&s;erve, that, excepting &s;ome marked ca&s;es of dy&s;en|tery, among the &s;ervants of the pri&s;on and ho&s;pital, in the months of Augu&s;t and September, before the arrival of the pri&s;oners from the We&s;t Indies, and one ca&s;e of typhus (in ward 18) with now and then a ca&s;e of &s;mall-pox, among the We&s;t Indians, after their arrival, there was not any contagious febrile di&s;order that made its appearance within the walls of the ho&s;pital, while I had charge of it, notwith|&s;tanding the many &s;ources of contagion to which, in my opinion, all in and about it were expo&s;ed. Du|ring the la&s;t five months of my time, no fewer than 1686 patients were admitted into the ho&s;pital, as may be &s;een by the ho&s;pital books.</P>
<P>The following table &s;erves to &s;hew, at one view, the highe&s;t number of patients in the ho&s;pital, the number di&s;charged and dead, weekly, for four weeks before, and &s;ix weeks after the nitrous vapour was fir&s;t u&s;ed; <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> from the 16th of October, to the 26th of December, 1796. To include a greater &s;pace of time would be improper; becau&s;e, before the 16th of October, there were but few patients in the ho&s;pital; and, becau&s;e, after the 26th of De|cember, there were a great number of extremely bad ca&s;es of gangrenous feet, pneumonia, &amp;c. re|ceived into it, from Portche&s;ter ho&s;pital, and from the Vigilant and Captivity pri&s;on &s;hips.</P>

<P>After the&s;e general ob&s;ervations on the nitrous vapour, I &s;hall humbly beg leave to offer the fol|lowing Ca&s;es, in which it was, undoubtedly, u&s;ed with very remarkable &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>CASE I.&mdash;Jean Louis, French pri&s;oner, of co|lour, eighteen years of age, from the We&s;t Indies, was admitted into the ho&s;pital on the 28th of Octo|ber 1796, for an ill-conditioned Ulcer on the infe|rior and interior part of the right leg. After he had been &s;ome time in the ho&s;pital, the ulcer began to put on a favourable appearance, and was &s;oon con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed in its &s;ize, merely by means of &s;imple dre&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>On the 29th of November, however, the ulcer according to the common phra&s;e, became foul; and, by next day, it had &s;pread to &s;uch a degree, that it was nearly as exten&s;ive again as it ever had been, attended with very acute pain, and with a very co|pious thin dark-coloured fetid di&s;charge. The pa|tient's pul&s;e, at this time, was 120, tongue clean; appetite impaired, belly open; &s;leep much di&s;turbed.</P>
<P>31&s;t. From the 29th to this time, a common poultice, thrice a day, was the only application; but
<PB N="102" REF="036328_0100_1008ED3201FDAC90">
now, in addition to the poultice, the ulcer was dre&s;&s;|ed with the powder of Peruvian bark; a cooling medicine, with an opiate at bed-time, was ordered; and a vegetable diet with milk was enjoined.</P>
<P>2d December. The ulcer &s;till more exten&s;ive than it was on the 31&s;t ult. It now extended from the Tar&s;us &s;ix or &s;even inches upwards, and from the Tibia more than half round the leg: it was &s;till in a &s;loughing &s;tate, with high, reflected edges. The other &s;ymptoms much the &s;ame as before. Finding that the plan hitherto pur&s;ued had not produced any good effect, either on the ulcer or on the &s;y&s;tem, the whole of it, excepting the poultice, was aban|doned, and the nitrous vapour adopted. The ward in general, and the bed of the patient in particular, were carefully fumigated, the ward once, the bed twice a day.</P>
<P>3d. The ulcer had &s;topt &s;preading, and in &s;ome places looked clean. Such a &s;udden change was to me a&s;toni&s;hing. Pul&s;e now 110; tongue clean; bel|ly open; &s;lept better on the night of the 2d than for &s;ome time before, notwith&s;tanding the omi&s;&s;ion of the opiate.</P>
<P>4th. The ulcer was clean, and di&s;charged good matter. The patient felt him&s;elf comfortable. Pul&s;e about 90.</P>
<P>6th. The di&s;charge continued to be good; and the ulcer had made con&s;iderable progre&s;s in healing. The patient felt him&s;elf perfectly ea&s;y, and his health was already very much mended.</P>
<P>The fumigation was continued until the 26th of December; from which time, owing to a want of materials, it was di&s;continued until the 11th of Ja|nuary, 1797. The ulcer, during the time the fu|migation was u&s;ed, and even to the 1&s;t of January, 1797, continued to heal kindly, and rapidly; but,
<PB N="103" REF="036328_0101_1008ED35F03FE208">
at that period, it again became foul and &s;loughing, and was &s;oon as exten&s;ive as before. The appetite was again impaired; pul&s;e 120, and &s;mall; belly open; the patient much weakened and emaciated. Half a drachm of Peruvian bark, thrice a day, and eight ounces of wine in the twenty-four hours, were ordered; and the ulcer was dre&s;&s;ed twice a day with the powder of common Peruvian bark and common poultice. An opiate was occa&s;ionally allowed at bed|time. This treatment was pre&s;erved until the 11th, when, having experienced no good effects from it, it was di&s;continued, and recour&s;e again had to the nitrous vapour, and common poultice, as on the 2d of December, 1796.</P>
<P>12th. The ulcer had &s;topt &s;preading, and in &s;ome places had begun to clean. The pul&s;e was le&s;s fre|quent, and more full; and the patient was, in every re&s;pect, better, and more comfortable. The nitrous vapour, &amp;c. were continued.</P>
<P>13th. The ulcer was perfectly clean, with florid granulations, and with about the eighth of an inch of new &s;kin round the edges. The plan was con|tinued.</P>
<P>20th. The ulcer looked very healthy, and was contracting rapidly. The plan was continued.</P>
<P>5th February. The ulcer had contracted more than one half. The plan was continued.</P>
<P>12th March. The ulcer was nearly healed, (not &s;o much as the breadth of a &s;ixpence being open) and looking healthy. On this day I fini&s;hed my duty, and, con&s;equently, my ob&s;ervations, at Forton ho&s;|pital.</P>
<P>I have here to ob&s;erve, that about the 1&s;t of Ja|nuary 1797, all the ulcers in the &s;ame ward (N^o 14) with the above, were more or le&s;s in a bad &s;tate; and that they all, about one and the &s;ame time, be|gan
<PB N="104" REF="036328_0102_1008E35968366B18">
to put on a favourable appearance; and al&s;o that, in a &s;hort while, many of them healed. Like|wi&s;e, it is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that particular at|tention was paid all along to cleanline&s;s and ventila|tion.</P>
<P>CASE II. La Granade, French pri&s;oner, aged 26 years, from the We&s;t Indies, was admitted into the ho&s;pital on the 16th of December, 1796, for chilblains. In the end of February 1797, an ulcer broke out on his left leg, which became very foul and &s;loughing, and did not yield to common reme|dies. On the 7th of the following March, the ni|trous vapour was u&s;ed, exactly in the &s;ame manner as in the preceding Ca&s;e, and by the 12th the ulcer was perfectly clean.</P>
<P>CASE III.&mdash;Elie Double, French pri&s;oner, aged 22 years, from the We&s;t Indies, was admitted into the ho&s;pital on the 28th of October 1796, for an ulcer on the anterior and middle part of his left leg. By the middle of February, 1797, the ulcer was cicatri&s;ed, but with a con&s;iderable protuberance remaining over that part of the tibia, as if the peri|o&s;teum and even the bone it&s;elf, had been in a di&s;|ea&s;ed &s;tate. About the end of February the cica|trix became inflamed, &s;oon &s;uppurated, and degene|rated into a foul &s;loughing ulcer, which, in&s;tead of yielding to any of the various applications, got wor&s;e and wor&s;e every day. From the end of February, (I cannot exactly tell the day,) catapla&s;ms of differ|ent kinds, myrrh, and Peruvian bark, were tried externally; and wine, Peruvian bark, opium, &amp;c. were admini&s;tered internally. At the &s;ame time, great attention was be&s;towed in keeping the ward extremely clean, and thoroughly ventilated. Find|ing not only that no good effect was produced by any of the&s;e means, but even that the ulcer, the
<PB N="105" REF="036328_0103_1008ED8E5193CD38">
&s;ound parts being &s;till in a mouldering &s;tate, grew more and more exten&s;ive, I came to a determination, con&s;idering my&s;elf &s;ufficiently authori&s;ed, from the experience I had had, to make trial, in this unto|ward ca&s;e, of Dr. J. C. Smyth's nitrous vapour. Accordingly, on the 7th of March the fumigation was put in practice, in the &s;ame way as in the fore|going ca&s;es; and, it is with heart-felt plea&s;ure I re|late it, by the 12th, that was in five days time, and on the day I fini&s;hed my duty at Forton, the ulcer was perfectly clean and healthy.</P>
<P>CASE IV.&mdash;Francois a negro French pri&s;oner, age unknown, was admitted into the ho&s;pital on the 26th of January 1797, for a wounded little finger. On examining the wound, I found that the la&s;t bone and the &s;urrounding liguments were the parts mo&s;t materially injured. The bone was fractured, and the &s;oft parts were contu&s;ed to a very great degree, with a &s;mall lacerated wound at the tip of the finger. Deeming it nece&s;&s;ary, I immediately amputated the limb at the joint formed by the &s;econd and la&s;t phalanges. The &s;tump, the bone being well covered, and the &s;oft parts looking healthy, had all the appearance of doing well, during the fir&s;t fortnight; but, unfortunately, at the expiration of that period, it began to put on a very unfavourable a&s;pect. In&s;tead of the di&s;ea&s;ed parts being &s;inuous, or having, what is perfectly under&s;tood in &s;urgical language, a gla&s;&s;y appear|ance, which &s;ometimes indicate a di&s;ea&s;ed bone, they became enlarged to a prodigious degree, re|flecting very con&s;iderably, &s;o as to re&s;emble a ball on the end of the &s;tump; and, at the &s;ame time, appeared &s;oul, di&s;charging a dark thin fetid matter. In this &s;tate, Peruvian bark, opium, &amp;c. were tried, as al&s;o catapla&s;ms, but to no purpo&s;e. In
<PB N="106" REF="036328_0104_1008ED3B9A0C3A68">
the end of February, recour&s;e was had to the nitrous vapour; and, by means of it, in &s;ix days time, the ulcer was perfectly clean.</P>
<P>CASE V.&mdash;Ba&s;tern, a negro French pri&s;oner, age unknown, was admitted into the ho&s;pital on the 28th of January 1797, for an ulcerated toe. This ca&s;e very &s;imilar to the finger of which I have ju&s;t taken notice, and, like it, after various in|effectual applications, was cleaned, and put, &s;eem|ingly, in a healthy &s;tate, by means of the nitrous vapour u&s;ed according to the manner I have already related. The four la&s;t ca&s;es were in the &s;ame ward, No. 4.</P>
<P>Having, with re&s;pect to Dr. J. Smyth's nitrous vapour, agreeably to my promi&s;e, fini&s;hed the mo&s;t important part of my experiments, with the phaeno|mena re&s;ulting from them, in order to &s;hew you that vapour, under proper management, is capable of producing very happy effects on the human frame, I &s;hall now mo&s;t humbly offer a few ob&s;ervations which appear to me to be connected with the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>And, to proceed; I am in great hopes that the facts detailed in the&s;e pages, while they &s;erve as &s;o many proofs of the utility of Dr. J. C. Smyth's fu|migating plan, will, at the &s;ame time, an&s;wer the happy purpo&s;e of not only removing the ill-ground|ed fear of Dr. Trotter, and of convincing him, as well as tho&s;e who think as he does, that no dan|ger is to be apprehended from the combination of azote with the nitrous vapour; but, al&s;o, of conquering the prejudices of tho&s;e gentlemen who imagine (for &s;ome highly re&s;pectable me|dical practitioners have lately mentioned to me their apprehen&s;ions) that that vapour, from its be|ing loaded with vitriolic acid, mu&s;t be intolerable
<PB N="107" REF="036328_0105_1008ED3F2FD554B0">
to the lungs, and of cour&s;e highly pernicious to per|&s;ons &s;ubjected to its influence.</P>
<P>With regard to the bad, or deleterious effects of the nitrous vapour, I cannot &s;ay, from experience, that I am acquainted with any of them. The trials that I made of that vapour were on a great num|ber of di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;ons, who, although crowded together within the walls of an exten&s;ive ho&s;pital, and from that circum&s;tance, as well as others of at lea&s;t equal moment, expo&s;ed to the influence of noxious effluvia, were obviou&s;ly, in many in&s;tances, as already mentioned, benefited by its &s;alutary ef|fects. Many patients were cured; others were put in a fair way of being cured. And, I mu&s;t add, for it is not, I pre&s;ume, altogether improba|ble, that by means of the nitrous vapour, with other no le&s;s important mea&s;ures, which I adopted, and ince&s;&s;antly followed when in my power, the pati|ents who were under my charge, in Forton ho&s;pi|tal, were pre&s;erved from the attacks of contagious fever. I have ventured to &s;ay with other no le&s;s important mea&s;ures, becau&s;e I am well aware, as Dr. J. C. Smyth undoubtedly is, that, without the mo&s;t &s;trict attention to cleanline&s;s, and to the circu|lation of pure or atmo&s;pheric air, neither the ni|trous vapour, nor any thing admini&s;tered with &s;imilar intentions, can prove &s;o efficacious as we could wi&s;h, in preventing or putting a &s;top to con|tagious fever, as well as other di&s;ea&s;es, though perhaps not &s;o immediately, yet ultimately as fatal. I am here under the nece&s;&s;ity of ob&s;erving, having forgot to do it in the proper place, that the &s;olitary ca&s;e of Typhus, which, as before mentioned, was in ward eighteen, did not originate in the ho&s;pital, but in the Captivity pri&s;on &s;hip. What the nature of the di&s;order had been primarily, I am at a lo&s;s
<PB N="108" REF="036328_0106_1008ED41D5B2D328">
to &s;ay. The patient died, and, fortunately, &s;o did the di&s;ea&s;e; for I &s;aw not another fever of a &s;imilar nature in the ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>As no contagious fever (I mean typhus, or what &s;ome authors have called jail fever, others ho&s;pital fever, &amp;c.) prevailed, during my time, in Forton ho&s;pital, I cannot &s;ay po&s;itively that the nitrous va|pour &s;olely prevented &s;uch a fever from prevailing. All that I can &s;ay is only, that the circum&s;tance of no contagious fever having prevailed in Forton ho&s;|pital, during my time, may be con&s;idered as being of a very &s;ingular nature; more e&s;pecially when we take into our view the va&s;t number of patients, in the mo&s;t filthy &s;tate, from the We&s;t Indies, &amp;c. that were received. The very particular attention that was paid to the patients, on their being re|ceived, in &s;tripping them of all their clothes, in bathing them, in &s;having their heads, in burning all their clothes, and al&s;o in keeping the ho&s;pital, at all times, extremely clean, and thoroughly ven|tilated, may, it is probable, have contributed not a little towards preventing contagious fever. And, further, another circum&s;tance which, perhaps, had operated very powerfully in a&s;&s;i&s;ting to obviate con|tagious fever, and which de&s;erves to be very parti|cularly remarked, was the changing of the wards as frequently as it was po&s;&s;ible, and that according to the nature of the complaints they contained; for in&s;tance, and by compari&s;on, wards that contained convale&s;cents, and al&s;o tho&s;e that contained &s;light or chronic di&s;ea&s;es, were changed frequently; tho&s;e that contained febrile di&s;ea&s;es more frequently, and tho&s;e that contained very bad &s;urgical ca&s;es mo&s;t frequently. By the changing of wards, I mean the removing of the patients from one that they
<PB N="109" REF="036328_0107_1008ED44B70C73F8">
had occupied for &s;ome time, to another that was perfectly purified.</P>
<P>When a ward of whatever de&s;cription was chang|ed, it was fir&s;t emptied, by the patients being re|moved into another, and by its bedding being &s;ent to be baked, fumigated, or wa&s;hed; and then it was without lo&s;s of time fumigated by means of &s;ulphur; then white-wa&s;hed; then its cradles cleaned, and wa&s;hed with vinegar; then the floor of it thoroughly cleaned; and, la&s;tly, its windows on the one &s;ide, and its &s;cuttles on the other, were kept open, always when the weather would permit, until it was again occupied by patients, which, if the &s;tate of the ho&s;pital admitted, was not before eight days had expired. Such regulations as the above ought, in my humble opinion, to be con|&s;tantly and very particularly ob&s;erved, by all medi|cal men who have the immediate charge of ho&s;pitals for pri&s;oners of war: many of them, I pre&s;ume, might, with propriety and utility, be ob&s;erved in any ho&s;pital; and, in concluding this &s;ubject, I beg leave humbly to &s;ugge&s;t to you that no ho&s;pital ought to be full, but, on the contrary, that there &s;hould always be, in all, according to their differ|ent &s;izes, two, three, four, or more wards left empty, for the very &s;alutary purpo&s;e of changing.</P>
<P>Cleanline&s;s, ventilation, and changing of the wards, whether with the view of obviating or re|moving di&s;ea&s;es, are, in all ho&s;pitals, as well as in all places where pri&s;oners of war are confined, &amp;c. ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary: where they are ob&s;erved, medicines will become le&s;s needful; and when need|ful, they will, in their operation, be more effectu|al; but, where they are neglected, the phy&s;icians and &s;urgeons will be &s;ubjected to the very unplea&s;ant trouble of giving their attendance, and of pre&s;crib|ing,
<PB N="110" REF="036328_0108_1008ED4963B78A18">
to very little purpo&s;e. Warmth ought al&s;o to be attended to.</P>
<P>In &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hments as Forton, cleanline&s;s, a free circulation of air, proper diet, &amp;c. ought, agreeably to the very particular orders which you i&s;&s;ue, to be mo&s;t rigidly attended to, from one end of the&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hments to the other. But, I am afraid, orders are not always rigidly executed. The unpardonable neglect of &s;ervants, in not executing, with promptitude and &s;crupulous punctuality, the orders with which they are entru&s;ted, is to be la|mented, but, I fear, not to be, on all occa&s;ions, either prevented or corrected. From what I know of the e&s;tabli&s;hments in que&s;tion, I &s;hall venture to &s;ay, that, were they always to be properly con|ducted by the &s;ervants who have the immediate charge of them, we &s;hould hear le&s;s frequently of the pri&s;oners, &amp;c. falling a prey to contagious fe|ver than we have hitherto done. This is a &s;ubject, however, with which, at pre&s;ent, I &s;hall not fur|ther concern my&s;elf, excepting to make the follow|ing ob&s;ervation, which is, that while due care is not taken, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, to prevent conta|gion from taking effect, the u&s;e of Dr. J. C. Smyth's nitrous vapour becomes, undoubtedly, the more particularly nece&s;&s;ary: but I am extremely &s;orry to think that Dr. Smyth's plan, as well as others equally well intended, &s;hould not always be put in execution, but more e&s;pecially in ca&s;es of emergency, with that facility, with that eagerne&s;s, with that candour, which duty, ju&s;tice, and hu|manity, continually require.</P>
<P>Although I have, in the cour&s;e of the&s;e ob&s;er|vations, laid very con&s;iderable &s;tre&s;s on cleanline&s;s, ventilation, changing of wards, &amp;c. yet I would not, by any means, wi&s;h it to be &s;uppo&s;ed that
<PB N="111" REF="036328_0109_1008ED4B29C17BD0">
I have done it with the view of &s;uper&s;eding the u&s;e of the nitrous vapour: on the contrary, while on the one hand I am &s;en&s;ible that the nitrous va|pour cannot, without cleanline&s;s, ventilation, chang|ing of the wards, &amp;c. be &s;o efficacious as we could wi&s;h, in putting a &s;top to contagious fever; I am, on the other hand, no le&s;s &s;en&s;ible that that fever, when raging to a violent degree, cannot be exter|minated by means of cleanline&s;s, ventilation, &amp;c. without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome other means. With re&s;pect to ho&s;pitals, &s;hips, pri&s;ons, &amp;c. where peo|ple are crowded together, where the introduction of contagious fever is dreaded, or where it actu|ally prevails, the nitrous vapour, with due atten|tion to cleanline&s;s, ventilation, &amp;c. may, at once, I pre&s;ume, not only be con&s;idered the mo&s;t conve|nient, the mo&s;t elegant, and the mo&s;t ingenious, but al&s;o the mo&s;t efficacious remedy for the pur|po&s;e of counteracting different &s;pecies of contagion, that has yet been offered to the public.</P>
<P>Further, although cleanline&s;s, ventilation, and the changing of wards, very &s;trictly attended to, might, in a very great mea&s;ure, prevent contagion from taking effect, or from &s;preading exten&s;ively, yet, &s;uppo&s;ing them to be attended to as &s;trictly as, from the nature of things, it is po&s;&s;ible, they could not, I am too much afraid, de&s;troy contagion, when prevailing in an exten&s;ive ho&s;pital, &amp;c. For example, let us &s;uppo&s;e only five or &s;ix hundred patients confined in Forton ho&s;pital, and labouring under contagious fever; and let us al&s;o &s;uppo&s;e it nece&s;&s;ary, for the &s;ake of cleanline&s;s, and of put|ting a &s;top to the contagion, to completely &s;hift all the&s;e patients once, perhaps many of them twice, and &s;ome of them even thrice, every day; how, give me leave to a&s;k, would it be po&s;&s;ible to fur|ni&s;h
<PB N="112" REF="036328_0110_1008ED4E51360568">
&s;uch a great number of patients &s;o frequently with the clean things required? For my part, I am fully per&s;uaded that it would prove difficult; &s;o extremely &s;o, indeed, that it would amount even to an impo&s;&s;ibility. With re&s;pect to ventilation, has it not been found, even when it has been at|tended to very particularly, to be, without the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of other means, inadequate to the &s;peedy de&s;truction of contagion? And, with regard to the changing of wards, were it &s;ufficient of it&s;elf to de|&s;troy contagion, might it not, I &s;hall &s;ay &s;ometimes, from the number of patients received being equal, nay even more than equal, to all the wards of which the ho&s;pital con&s;i&s;ts, be utterly impractica|ble? Other examples, and other queries, to the &s;ame effect, were they not deemed &s;uperfluous, might be advanced: then, con&s;idering the bu&s;ine&s;s in this point of view, does it not become a duty in|cumbent on us to look out for, and to try other means more active, and more diffu&s;ive, which, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of cleanline&s;s, ventilation, changing of wards, &amp;c. may be employed for the purpo&s;e of more &s;peedily, and more effectually de&s;troying contagion? and may not the nitrous vapour of Dr. J. C. Smyth, as I have already mentioned, be deemed, of all other remedies extant, the mo&s;t con|venient, the mo&s;t elegant, the mo&s;t ingenious, and the mo&s;t efficacious for an&s;wering the wi&s;hed-for purpo&s;e, whether at &s;ea or on &s;hore?</P>
<P>The extraordinary effects which we have &s;een the nitrous vapour produce, in ca&s;es of putrid ul|cers, are facts of the utmo&s;t importance to man|kind, and certainly de&s;erve the mo&s;t &s;erious atten|tion of medical practitioners. They not only &s;hew, in the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory manner, the power of that vapour in &s;uch ca&s;es, but al&s;o point out, in my
<PB N="113" REF="036328_0111_1008ED510DD3A858">
humble opinion, the probability of its having, in a &s;imilar way, as &s;alutary a power in contagious fe|ver, and in many other di&s;ea&s;es proceeding from other &s;pecies of contagion. This opinion may, perhaps, &s;eem &s;ingular; but I &s;hall endeavour to evince its con&s;i&s;tence with rea&s;on and experience.</P>
<P>In ho&s;pital practice, it has been frequently ob|&s;erved, not only by me, but by other medical prac|titioners, that all the ulcers of patients in the &s;ame ward have on a &s;udden, and nearly at one and the &s;ame time, changed from, apparently, an healthy, to a foul, &s;loughing, or putrid &s;tate. I have be|&s;towed con&s;iderable attention in ob&s;erving this change; and, in the cour&s;e of my practice, have been able to make the following remarks, which I &s;hall here arrange as they &s;tand among my memo|randums.</P>
<P>That, fir&s;t, one ulcer degenerated, then another, and &s;o on, until all the ulcers, in the &s;ame ward had taken on a &s;imilar di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>That tho&s;e ulcers neare&s;t the one which fir&s;t de|generated were &s;ooner affected than tho&s;e at a greater di&s;tance.</P>
<P>That this lamentable change did not happen in all the &s;urgical wards at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>That the patients, when their ulcers were in this degenerated &s;tate, laboured, more or le&s;s, under &s;ymptoms of fever, &s;uch as a frequent, &s;mall pul&s;e, unnatural heat, &s;ometimes chilline&s;s, dry &s;kin, lo&s;s of appetite, &amp;c.</P>
<P>That common dre&s;&s;ings, common poultices, car|rot poultices, turnip poultices, myrrh, Peruvian bark, applied to the ulcers, had no good effects.</P>
<P>That Peruvian bark, wine, opium, given inter|nally, had, I thought, in&s;tead of good, bad effects.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="036328_0112_1008ED54186A5208">
That, in one ca&s;e, yea&s;t was tried, both inter|nally and externally, but the di&s;ea&s;e evidently gained ground under the cour&s;e.</P>
<P>That the acetum nitro&s;um,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Pater&s;on on Scurvy.</NOTE> whether u&s;ed inter|nally or externally, &s;eemed to have good effects.</P>
<P>That the changing of the wards had always good effects.</P>
<P>That the nitrous vapour, with the like attention to cleanline&s;s and ventilation as was in common be|&s;towed, had, without changing the ward, as in the five ca&s;es mentioned, as well as in many others, effects &s;uperior to tho&s;e re&s;ulting from the chang|ing of the ward, without the u&s;e of the nitrous vapour.</P>
<P>That the nitrous vapour had not the like good effects, without cleanline&s;s and ventilation, as with them.</P>
<P>From the&s;e premi&s;es, I have thought it war|rantable to draw the two following conclu&s;ions:</P>
<P N="1">1. That &s;uch a degeneration of ulcers, in ho&s;|pitals, from, apparently, an healthy, to a foul, &s;loughing, putrid &s;tate, can only be accounted for on the principle of contagion.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the nitrous vapour, with due attention to cleanline&s;s, ventilation, changing of the wards, &amp;c. is, &s;eemingly, the remedy, of all others extant, be&s;t calculated for preventing, or &s;peedily de&s;troying that contagion; and from this naturally ari&s;es the following query:</P>
<P>As, under &s;uch regulations, the nitrous vapour has &s;uch great power in preventing or de&s;troying one &s;pecies of contagion, may it not, under the &s;ame regulations, be equally powerful in preventing or de&s;troying other &s;pecies of contagion?</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="036328_0113_1008ED56B6319C88">
I mu&s;t here ob&s;erve, that the &s;econd conclu&s;ion does not exclude the u&s;e of other medicines. Suit|able remedies, both internally and externally, u&s;ed at the &s;ame time with the nitrous vapour, will, no doubt, forward the cure. But, as the&s;e pages are intended for the purpo&s;e of pointing out &s;ome of the effects of Dr. J. C. Smyth's nitrous vapour, and not as a treati&s;e on ulcers, I cannot, with re&s;pect to the latter, make, with any degree of propriety, an at|tempt on either the indications of cure or remedies.</P>
<P>On the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, I might, to what has been advanced, add many more medical ob&s;ervations, were I not of opinion that, after the experiments of Dr. Smyth,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Dr. J. C. Smyth's letter to the Right Honourable Earl Spencer, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE> they would appear &s;uperfluous; and I might, with equal propriety, have recour&s;e to che|mical rea&s;oning, were I not prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the idea that, con&s;idering what has been already &s;aid, re&s;pecting Dr. Smyth's nitrous vapour, by that very ingenious chemi&s;t Mr. Keir, of Birmingham<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vide Dr. J. C. Smyth's letter to the Right Honourable Earl Spencer, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Appendix.</NOTE> it would be extremely pre&s;umptuous.</P>
<P>On the whole, and to conclude, I cannot help being of opinion, as well from the facts with which Dr. Smyth has favoured the public, and from what Mr. Keir has advanced, as from my own ex|perience, that very great benefit mu&s;t re&s;ult to mankind from the <HI>proper u&s;e</HI> of the nitrous vapour, on board of &s;hips, in ho&s;pitals, in pri&s;ons, in all places where people may be crowded together, and even in private families, in preventing and in put|ting a &s;top to contagion, as well as in mitigating and removing other di&s;ea&s;es, in which other medi|cines would not perhaps have the like good effects.
<PB N="116" REF="036328_0114_1008ED5984B7BBB0">
And, therefore, I mo&s;t &s;incerely wi&s;h that the plan of Dr. J. C. Smyth may be univer&s;ally adopted; and that it may, for the good of our navy and ar|my, for the honour of our country, and for the be|nefit of mankind, be practi&s;ed by medical men, and others, without their conceiving any prejudice a|gain&s;t either it or its ingenious Author.</P>

<P>SINCE fini&s;hing the preceding letter, I have had an opportunity of making further trial of the nitrous vapour, in a di&s;ea&s;e of a &s;ingular nature. The hooping cough, which has been prevailing here all this &s;ummer, made its appearance in my family la&s;t month, this being a contagious di&s;ea&s;e, and a change of air having been found u&s;eful in removing it, I &s;uppo&s;ed that the nitrous vapour might not only operate in counteracting the contagion, but al&s;o have effects &s;imilar to the changing of &s;ituation; and
<PB N="117" REF="036328_0115_1008ED5C36F29AC8">
hence, that it might, providing the lungs of my lit|tle patients could bear it, prove a convenient, an elegant, and u&s;eful remedy, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. It was from the&s;e conjectures, and knowing that it would have been extremely inconvenient for me to have &s;ent my children from home, that I ventured to make trial of Dr. Smyth's fumigating plan; the re&s;ult of which I &s;hall &s;tate, as briefly as po&s;&s;ibly, by &s;ketching the following ca&s;es.</P>
<P>My third child, a girl of five years old, was &s;eiz|ed with a &s;light inflammation of the throat, attend|ed with hoar&s;ene&s;s, about the 6th of la&s;t month; and about the 10th with a cough on which the in|flammation and hoar&s;ene&s;s went off, the cough for &s;ome days, &s;eemed to be of a common kind, from cold; but by the 15th it a&s;&s;umed the appearance of hooping cough, accompanied with a &s;light degree of fever. By this time my &s;econd child, a girl of &s;ix years, and al&s;o, my fourth or younge&s;t, a boy of fifteen months, had begun to cough.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">My olde&s;t child had the hooping cough about three years ago.</NOTE></P>
<P>On the 17th, the third child had frequent and violent fits of coughing, with the hoop &s;trongly marked; and the &s;econd and fourth, though not &s;o ill, evidently laboured under the di&s;ea&s;e. In the evening of this day, I began the u&s;e of the nitrous vapour, I &s;hut up my little patients, with a &s;ervant, in their bed-room &s;ixteen feet by twelve, and &s;ix feet nine inches high, my&s;elf &s;uperintending the bu|&s;ine&s;s. In&s;tead of a pipkin for holding the hot &s;and, I u&s;ed an iron pot, in which was placed two galli|pots, containing the concentrated vitriolic acid and nitre, according to the directions of Dr. Smyth. In about five or &s;ix minutes the room was filled with vapour, and continued &s;o for an hour, without any

of the children coughing or &s;hewing any &s;igns of unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>18th, 19th, 20th. The fumigation was repeated every evening, and continued an hour, without coughing or any unea&s;ine&s;s occurring.</P>
<P>21&s;t. Now, all my little patients &s;eemed better, the fits of coughing recurring le&s;s frequently, and the mucus being more ea&s;ily di&s;charged than before.</P>
<P>14th September. From the 20th ult. to this time, the fumigation was repeated only &s;ix times, exactly in the &s;ame manner as before, without the children complaining of, or apparently feeling any di&s;agreeable effect from it; and now, on account of the mildne&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e, the cough not being trouble&s;ome even in the night, it was di&s;continued.&mdash;At this time the younge&s;t child evidently labour|ed under &s;ymptoms of teething; the cough, how|ever, did not appear in the lea&s;t aggravated.&mdash;To the &s;econd and third child, during the cour&s;e of the nitrous vapour, no other medicine was given; but to the younge&s;t, who was frequently con&s;tipated, a weak &s;olution of antimon. tart. which always ope|rated downwards, and &s;ometimes upwards, was occa&s;ionally admini&s;tered.</P>
<P>23d. The &s;econd, and third child, continue well; and the younge&s;t, though much di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with teething, coughs but &s;eldom, and very gentle.</P>
<P>Now after having &s;tated the&s;e facts, whether or not the nitrous vapour, had any effect in counter|acting the contagion or otherwi&s;e rendering the di&s;ea&s;e mild, and of &s;hort duration; or whether or not the di&s;ea&s;e would have naturally appeared mild, and have continued but a &s;hort time, without the interference of art, are points which I &s;hall not take upon me to determine. Further trials are undoubt|edly nece&s;&s;ary for the purpo&s;e of forming a judg|ment.
<PB N="119" REF="036328_0117_1008ED6258564920">
It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, however, that, even the few trials which have already been made, &s;erve, in the mean time, a very u&s;eful purpo&s;e; they clearly &s;hew, that even young children labouring under a di&s;ea&s;e, in which there is always, more or le&s;s, a determination to the lungs, &amp;c. are capable of in&s;piring the nitrous vapour without feeling from it any di&s;agreeable effects: hence there cannot, I pre&s;ume, be any objections to further trials of it being made in the hooping cough. Al&s;o the&s;e facts lead naturally to other important inferences, but as they mu&s;t be to you &s;ufficiently obvious, I avoid making them.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>As Surgeon to the 88th regiment, I have for the&s;e la&s;t four years, been witne&s;s to the dreadful ravages of an infectious fever in different quarters of the world. In England, in the i&s;land of Jer&s;ey, on the continent of Europe, during a voyage to, and in different i&s;lands of the We&s;t Indies, this fever has been the &s;courge of the regiment to which I have the honour to belong, and after a trial of every mode of practice which I could learn, it proved extremely fatal.</P>
<P>On my return from the We&s;t Indies, having &s;een in Duncan's Annals of Medicine, an account of your work on fever, I determined to take the earlie&s;t op|portunity of giving a trial to the mode which you recommended, of weakening and de&s;troying conta|gion.</P>
<P>The 88th regiment, for nine months previous to their landing in Jer&s;ey, had been in the mo&s;t healthy condition; they landed on the 6th of June la&s;t, and continued in the &s;ame healthy &s;tate till the middle of la&s;t July. On the 17th of July, the fir&s;t ca&s;e of a fever, which has &s;ince very generally prevailed, made its appearance. The per&s;on was &s;eized with the wor&s;t &s;ymptoms of low typhus fever, and died on the 5th day. Having four years before, in this i&s;land, in the cour&s;e of ten weeks, lo&s;t fifty men in the &s;ame
<PB N="121" REF="036328_0119_1008ED6690D280D8">
fever, I determined to give the fulle&s;t and faire&s;t trail to any thing recommended by you. I had every a&s;&s;i&s;tance from one of the able&s;t commanding officers, Col. Bursford.</P>
<P>To diffu&s;e the contagious poi&s;on, I ordered the men, on the fir&s;t appearance of fever, to be moved from the barracks, (which are in an unhealthy &s;itu|ation) to tents pitched at &s;ome di&s;tance, on a dry and healthy &s;pot.</P>
<P>To de&s;troy the virulence of the contagion, where it evidently exi&s;ted, I made my two mates regularly fumigate the barrack rooms and ho&s;pital with nitrous vapour, in the manner you direct, the event will &s;hew the &s;ucce&s;s, of perhaps the fir&s;t trial of your excellent invention, in the army.</P>
<P>Of fifty-four ca&s;es of this fever, which occurred from the 17th of July to the 24th of September, the fir&s;t is the only one that I have lo&s;t. The very re|markable effect of the nitrous fumigation, appeared from the great diminution of the number taken ill, after it was u&s;ed. During the fir&s;t week twenty-four ca&s;es appeared, in the &s;econd week, ten, in the third, &s;even ca&s;es; and to this date,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The 8th of October.</NOTE> the number of ca&s;es continue to le&s;&s;en.</P>
<P>The effect of the nitrous fumigation, is evident, not only in the dimini&s;hed number of ca&s;es, but al&s;o in their degree of virulence. The ca&s;es that have of late appeared, have been gradually becoming milder, and are now what a late writer would call ca&s;es of &s;imple fever, having neither petechiae nor any dan|gerous &s;ymptom.</P>
<P>As your work on fever has but lately fallen into my hands, I have been able, only in few in&s;tances, to follow the practice which you recommend; every thing indeed has been &s;o completely effected, by fol|lowing
<PB N="122" REF="036328_0120_1008ED6A8C6241F0">
your manner of de&s;troying contagion, that, in general, little has been left for me, but to obvi|ate debility.</P>
<P>If you &s;hould wi&s;h to make any u&s;e of this com|munication, or &s;hould favour me with any thing fur|ther regarding your truly valuable di&s;covery, plea&s;e addre&s;s for me to the care of our agent, A. M'Do|nald, <ABBR>E&s;q.</ABBR> Pall-Mall court, London.</P>
<P>In a Memoir which I tran&s;mitted to the Army Medical Board lately, after an account of the fever which appeared in the 88th regiment, I gave an account of the &s;ucce&s;s of your plan, and thought it my duty to recommend it to the attention of the Board.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>By a letter of yours of the 26th of October, with which I was favoured, I was happy to learn that my conduct had met your approbation.</P>
<P>In September la&s;t, I &s;ent to my friend Dr. Garth|&s;hore, a copy of my Memoir to the Army Medical Board on the fever that lately prevailed in the 88th regiment. At his de&s;ire, I about three weeks ago, &s;ent him an abridged account of two memoirs on this fever, which, I believe he intends to tran&s;mit to Dr. Duncan, for the &s;econd volume of the Annals of
<PB N="123" REF="036328_0121_1008ED6C6F183E70">
Medicine. Pre&s;uming that it would be &s;atisfactory to you to &s;ee them, I herewith inclo&s;e you copies of my fir&s;t memoir, and of the abridged account &s;ent to Dr. Garth&s;hore. I had nearly fini&s;hed a &s;econd memoir, and hoped to be able to have concluded my <HI>statement</HI> of the fever, with an account of its extir|pation; but a few more ca&s;es have of late occurred. The appearance of the&s;e la&s;t ca&s;es is however very na|turally and ea&s;ily accounted for, and the treatment of them adds a &s;till further te&s;timony to the efficacy of the nitrous fumigation, and of the treatment for|merly pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>About the middle of October la&s;t, from the al|mo&s;t total di&s;appearance of the fever, we relaxed con&s;iderably in the fumigation, the only ca&s;es then in the fever-ho&s;pital, were convale&s;cents from fever. About this time, the different encampments break|ing up, we were obliged to admit a good many pneumonic and &s;ome dy&s;enteric ca&s;es which crowded this &s;mall ho&s;pital, (an old farm-hou&s;e hired for an ho&s;pital) and I was alarmed to &s;ee the fever break out again with all the original &s;ymptoms in &s;ix or &s;even convale&s;cents. By attention to the different circum&s;tances regarding fumigation, following the former treatment, and thinning the different rooms, matters are now brought to nearly the &s;ame good &s;tate as before the re-appearance of the fever.</P>
<P>The re-appearance of the fever, has however, not been entirely without its advantages, it has been the means of &s;hewing me a fact, which e&s;pecially in military practice, I conceive to be of the fir&s;t impor|tance. It has pointed out to me the efficacy of the nitrous fumigation in de&s;troying dy&s;enteric contagion. I have often been witne&s;s to the rapidity with which the contagion of dy&s;entery flew through the wards of an ho&s;pital, and how apt convale&s;cents from other
<PB N="124" REF="036328_0122_1008ED70585A7F40">
di&s;ea&s;es, and in particular from fever, were to be &s;eized with this di&s;ea&s;e. Though thirteen ca&s;es of dy&s;entery were &s;ent to the ho&s;pital, and &s;ome of them with very &s;evere &s;ymptoms, I know only of two in|&s;tances where the di&s;ea&s;e was communicated in the ho&s;pital, and with the exception of two chronic ca&s;es, the cure in all, has been much &s;peedier than I have formerly &s;een it under the &s;ame treatment.</P>
<P>Confident of &s;ucce&s;s, I wi&s;h much for opportunity of trying the fumigation in other contagious di&s;ea&s;es, particularly &s;mall-pox. In two ca&s;es of cynanche, attended with low fever, I u&s;ed it, and both patients (officers) are now well. I &s;hould be glad to hear if you have extended the trial to other di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>Some other circum&s;tances regarding our fever, I think proper to mention to you.</P>
<P>So &s;anguine was I at one time, in my expectations from the fumigation, that in &s;ome ca&s;es of the fever which I &s;et apart, I tru&s;ted &s;olely to nature and in|du&s;triou&s;ly fumigating, but I &s;oon &s;aw that in the&s;e ca&s;es I was rapidly lo&s;ing ground. I next in conjunc|tion with the fumigation, followed Dr. Cullen's plan of treatment; this in every ca&s;e protracted the cure, and in &s;everal in&s;tances, I was obliged totally to aban|don the plan. Being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch powerful means of de&s;troying the contagion, as the nitrous fumigation, I ventured to take the opportunity of giving trial to, and comparing &s;everal of the modes of practice recommended in fever; but a compari&s;on of ca&s;es as nearly equal as could be collected, gives the mo&s;t decided &s;uperiority to that recommended by Dr. Robert&s;on of Greenwich. But I think it likewi&s;e proper to mention, that under the type which fever lately a&s;&s;umed in this i&s;land, however proper the immediate exhibition of the bark was here, that it was by no means found &s;o proper a remedy in other
<PB N="125" REF="036328_0123_1008ED71E254CD98">
&s;ituations. In the We&s;t Indies, every trial given to the bark in the yellow fever during the paroxy&s;m, failed, and this not only with me, but in the hands of the phy&s;icians who had the charge of the large&s;t ho&s;pitals their.</P>
<P>I &s;hall never &s;ufficiently regret my being unac|quainted with your di&s;covery, while in the We&s;t In|dies; and though doubtle&s;s it will for a time, meet with the fate of every other that has been made for the benefit of mankind; yet, if candid and liberal practitioners will but do their duty, and give it a trial, I am confident it mu&s;t &s;oon carry conviction, and that you will derive that credit from it, which you &s;o ju&s;tly de&s;erve.</P>
<P>I have for &s;ome time been in the practice of keep|ing journals of my ca&s;es; every ca&s;e of this fever that has occurred &s;ince its origin, has been regi&s;ter|ed either by my&s;elf or by one of my a&s;&s;i&s;tants. The garri&s;on &s;urgeon here, and his a&s;&s;i&s;tants likewi&s;e, have witne&s;&s;ed the treatment: and the different facts mentioned in my memoir, are not unknown to &s;everal practitioners in the i&s;land.

Soon after our arrival in Jer&s;ey, in la&s;t June, and but a &s;hort time before the fir&s;t ca&s;e of this fever appeared, Dr. Smyth's work on fever came into my hands: I, therefore, on the fir&s;t appearance of the fever, gave the fulle&s;t trial to the u&s;e of the nitrous acid, and as the re&s;ult &s;hews, with the be&s;t &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The account which I here give, is extracted from two official memoirs, which I tran&s;mitted to the Army Medical Board on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The fever had nothing remarkable in its appear|ance from typhus fever, as I have u&s;ually &s;een it

occur, if I except the &s;uddenne&s;s of the attack, often with delirium or epilep&s;y; a very remarka|ble degree of debility; and a great pronene&s;s to relap&s;e. Two ca&s;es had the &s;carlet eruption with angina, and the mo&s;t of the fir&s;t ca&s;es, until they were &s;ent to camp, and were expo&s;ed to a current of air, had petechiae. In mo&s;t of the fir&s;t ca&s;es, the contagion could be clearly traced.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t appearance of this fever, alarmed at the fatal i&s;&s;ue of the fir&s;t ca&s;e, I my&s;elf not only carefully fumigated the ho&s;pital, the clothes, and bedding of the &s;ick, with nitrous acid, but my two a&s;&s;i&s;tants, Me&s;&s;rs. Bruce and Brown, likewi&s;e con|&s;tantly fumigated the different barrack-rooms<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The rooms, by this proce&s;s, were rendered &s;weet, and the men them&s;elves &s;oon became &s;en&s;ible of the comfort of it. Vide fir&s;t Memoir &s;ent to the Army Medical Board.</NOTE></P>
<P>Every man as &s;oon as &s;eized with the fever, was removed from the barracks, which are unhealthily &s;ituated, to tents pitched in a dry and airy &s;ituation, about a mile di&s;tant. The barracks were likewi&s;e thinned by encamping or removing from them, near half the regiment.</P>
<P>The <HI>treatment</HI> in general was, by immediately exhibiting the bark after giving an emetic or ca|thartic, and afterwards giving cordials, bli&s;ters, &amp;c. as indicated. The lavatio frigida, in &s;everal ca&s;es, &s;eemed to an&s;wer exceedingly well.</P>
<P>The <HI>first</HI> ca&s;e, which appeared on the 17th of July, died on the fifth day, with &s;ymptoms which are u&s;ually called highly putrid. This excited a very general alarm in the regiment.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here from my journal of ca&s;es, and the copies of reports made to the Medical Board, give a &s;tatement of the appearance of the ca&s;es of the fever: nothing can afford &s;tronger proof of the
<PB N="128" REF="036328_0126_1008ED79909A9C40">
efficacy of the means adopted to obviate and re|move this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>

<P>From this time, till the &s;ick were removed from the tents, to a hou&s;e where they were crowded, hardly another ca&s;e appeared. At this period, however, about the 20th of October, the fever with the original &s;ymptoms again appeared among &s;ome convale&s;cents and pneumonic ca&s;es; but by putting in practice the nitrous fumigation, and thinning the wards of the ho&s;pital, the fever was again very &s;oon got under.</P>
<P>Of the total number of ca&s;es of this fever that oc|curred, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> &s;ixty-&s;ix,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A very large proportion this of the regiment, which con&s;i&s;ted only of four hundred men.</NOTE> the fir&s;t is the only one that was lo&s;t; this, no doubt, is remarkable, and I not only a&s;cribe this &s;ucce&s;s to the u&s;e of the oxygenated nitrous acid, but I likewi&s;e think it highly probable, that by fumigating with this acid, the contagion is now nearly extinct, and that by its u&s;e, more ca&s;es of this fever have been prevented from appearing.</P>
<P>I have nothing at pre&s;ent to add to what Dr. Smyth has &s;aid of the u&s;e of the nitrous acid; every trial which I have made hitherto, tends to confirm his experiments.

I am, therefore, &s;till pur&s;uing Dr. Smyth's method of fumigation, and am happy to &s;ay, that, I have, a &s;econd time, experienced the mo&s;t happy and be|neficial effects from it. I will, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, forward to you, through Mr. Palmer, the particu|lars of my &s;ucce&s;s, and one advantage, at lea&s;t, will ari&s;e from this unavoidable delay, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the plea&s;ure

<P>HEREWITH I have the honour of forwarding to you &s;ome remarks I have made on the effects, very happy effects, of the nitrous acid fumigation, in &s;topping the progre&s;s of a contagious fever on board the hulks in Lang&s;tone harbour; and I am happy to convey to you my decided opinion in its favour; an opinion, not ha&s;tily formed, but founded on facts, which occurred on trying that excellent method of preventing, and le&s;&s;ening &s;ome of the mi&s;eries of our fellow-creatures.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Port&s;ea,</HI> <DATE><HI>January</HI> 13, 1799.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING with great plea&s;ure peru&s;ed your pub|lication on the fever, which prevailed among the Spani&s;h pri&s;oners of war at Winche&s;ter, and al&s;o, your account of the &s;ucce&s;s attending the nitrous fumigation, in de&s;troying contagion on board the Union ho&s;pital &s;hip, and on board a &s;quadron of Ru&s;&s;ian &s;hips of war at the Nore; I determined to try its effects on board the hulks in Lang&s;tone har|bour, near this town, the fir&s;t opportunity that might offer.</P>
<P>A fever of a contagious nature made its appear|ance on board the &s;aid hulks, in the month of July 1798, which &s;oon became alarming, not from the number of &s;ick only, but from the rapidity with which it advanced to its la&s;t, or fatal &s;tage. The number of patients continued increa&s;ing from the 6th of July, to the 29th of Augu&s;t; in the former month &s;ixteen were received, in the latter &s;ixty-&s;ix. Upon my repre&s;enting to Mr. Dyne, contractor for the care of convicts on board the &s;aid hulks, that I thought great benefit would en&s;ue, if the method of fumigating recommended by you, was put in prac|tice at Lang&s;tone harbour, he with a liberal hand &s;upplied the concentrated vitriolic acid and nitre, and humanely ordered that no expen&s;e might be &s;pared in attempting to &s;top the progre&s;s of the fever.</P>
<P>Pipkins, &amp;c. were procured here without lo&s;s of time, and we began fumigating on board the Sin|cerity ho&s;pital &s;hip, on the 29th of Augu&s;t, 1798, at which time it contained fifteen very ill of fever, fifteen recovering from fever, (and three of other complaints left in July) thirty-one had returned to
<PB N="132" REF="036328_0130_1008ED84D0C15650">
the pri&s;on cured, and five had paid the debt of nature.</P>
<P>It was with extreme plea&s;ure I ob&s;erved the ef|fects of the vapour on many of the fever patients. I will &s;tate them on one, which, with little vari|ation, will &s;erve for the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Daniel Stowell, aged twenty-&s;even, was received into the ho&s;pital-&s;hip on the 21&s;t of Augu&s;t, where he had continued getting wor&s;e till the commence|ment of the fumigation; he was then in the fol|lowing &s;tate. A mo&s;t &s;evere and confu&s;ed pain in his head, with inten&s;e heat on the &s;kin, and in&s;ati|able thir&s;t; tongue rough and extremely dry, ap|pearing like a burnt cru&s;t, and of a blacki&s;h colour, inability to put it out of the mouth when de&s;ired; teeth and gums covered with the &s;ame kind of fur as the tongue. Pul&s;e one hundred and thirty-one, &s;mall and weak. The vapour made him cough very much, and he reque&s;ted (his own words) <HI>to be &s;mok|ed no more;</HI> it was, however, repeated three times this day. Augu&s;t 30, Pul&s;e one hundred and one, and &s;tronger, &s;ome moi&s;ture on his tongue and gums, heat on the &s;kin greatly decrea&s;ed; head-ach much the &s;ame; thir&s;t not &s;o inten&s;e: fumigated three times this day. Thirty-fir&s;t, He was in every re|&s;pect better; continued the fumigation three times. September 1&s;t, Pul&s;e &s;eventy-nine, and &s;till &s;tronger than the two preceding days; other &s;ymptoms much relieved: continued the fumigation. Second, Pul&s;e &s;ixty-eight, &s;trong and regular; his appetite per|mitted him to take more nouri&s;hment than he had been able to do &s;ince his illne&s;s: from this day to the ninth, he continued getting better, and I now con&s;idered him in a &s;tate of convale&s;cence.</P>
<P>It is proper here to remark, that this man had an ulcer on his right leg, extending from the outer
<PB N="133" REF="036328_0131_1008ED865C85C200">
ancle acro&s;s the anterior part of the tibia to the ga&s;|trocnemius mu&s;cle, at which part it was four inches broad and very deep, and di&s;charged a thick ill-conditioned matter, which was very offen&s;ive. Its length was rather more than &s;ix inches. After &s;ome days fumigating, I ob&s;erved a change for the better in the appearance of the ulcer, and as I had tried a variety of methods to heal it, for many months be|fore he became ill of the fever, without producing any good effect; I laid this change to the effects of the vapour. I now directed it to the ulcer it&s;elf, and continued its u&s;e till October the 30th, when his ulcer was cicatri&s;ed; and I verily believe, to its efficacy is owing this poor man's cure. He is gone to New South Wales in the Hill&s;borough, which &s;ailed ju&s;t before Chri&s;tmas la&s;t; I &s;aw him the day before he embarked on board her, and the cicatrix was very firm: the ulcer was the con&s;e|quence of an old gun-&s;hot wound.</P>
<P>There is another ca&s;e of ulcer which I think has mended greatly &s;ince I fumigated it; I am proceed|ing as in the former ca&s;e, and I have great rea&s;on to believe it will ultimately prove &s;ucce&s;sful. The only dre&s;&s;ings u&s;ed during the fumigation, or more correctly &s;peaking, after the commencement of the fumigation, were dry lint and ung. re&s;in. flav. over which was laid a rag of linen, con&s;tantly kept wet with aqua lytharg. acetat. diluted with water.</P>
<P>Finding &s;uch beneficial effects from the fumigation on board the ho&s;pital &s;hip, in bringing the fever &s;ooner to a conclu&s;ion, by &s;hortening all its &s;tages, I determined to apply it to the &s;ource of the contagion; and accordingly the pri&s;on-hulks, la Fortune and Ceres were fumigated every night from October the 15th to November the 20th, (except two nights, the &s;ervant who was &s;ent for the acid to town (Port|&s;ea)
<PB N="134" REF="036328_0132_1008ED8919478EC0">
having &s;taid the fir&s;t night at a public hou&s;e, and did not arrive in time to fumigate the next night,) and I had the plea&s;ure of finding the &s;ick reduced to eight; and &s;even days had elap&s;ed, and not one patient had been &s;ent to the ho&s;pital-&s;hip. The fumigation was now di&s;continued.</P>
<P>November the 21&s;t, eight men were received from the Hill&s;borough Botany Bay &s;hip, one of which number was in the la&s;t &s;tage of a contagious fever, and two laboured under dy&s;entery. Several patients in a &s;tate of recovery caught the new con|tagion, and many attendants were taken ill with the diarrhoea and dy&s;entery; and as it was impo&s;&s;ible to prevent communication with the pri&s;on-hulks, the pri&s;oners again became &s;ickly, and many died; &s;ome of whom were not ill three days before that awful event took place; and one man in particular died delirious twelve hours after he was received into the ho&s;pital-&s;hip.</P>
<P>The fumigation, which I con&s;idered as the anchor of hope, was again re&s;orted to November the 26th, and continued to the pre&s;ent time, January<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Smyth will be plea&s;ed to add three days more to the time which had ela&s;ped on Sunday la&s;t (the 13th) without having received any patient whatever from the hulks into our ho&s;pital-&s;hip&mdash;Po&s;t&s;cript of a Letter to Dr. John&s;ton, dated the 16th of January.</NOTE> 13th, 1799; and it is with &s;uperlative &s;atisfaction I add, that there has not been a patient received for the la&s;t eighteen days, neither is there a &s;ingle fever patient in the ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>It is not my intention, neither is it nece&s;&s;ary, to trouble you with a detail of my method of treating this fever; what I have to &s;ay relating only to the happy effects of the fumigation, and it is with pe|culiar plea&s;ure I a&s;&s;ert, that the progre&s;s of the fe|ver
<PB N="135" REF="036328_0133_1008ED8AC713AD10">
has been <HI>twice</HI> completely arre&s;ted by per&s;eve|rance in its u&s;e; it may, however, be nece&s;&s;ary and proper to &s;ay a few words on its fir&s;t introduction, and on its fatal effects on many who were its victims; I will, therefore, relate the ca&s;e of one patient, which will &s;hew inconte&s;tably the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t per&s;on taken ill, was John Smith, a convict, who had been &s;ent from Newgate a &s;hort time before. He informed me, July 6th, 1798, the day he was received on board the ho&s;pital-&s;hip, that he had been ill of a fever in Newgate, and had not recovered his &s;trength when he was &s;ent to the hulks, at Lang&s;tone harbour. The convicts having been remarkably healthy, previous to the reception of this man, and becoming very &s;ickly immediately after his admi&s;&s;ion, I con&s;idered the fever as intro|duced by him. He complained this day, (July 6) of head-ach; pains in his back, loins, and extre|mities; his &s;kin was very hot and thir&s;t great; tongue covered with a yellowi&s;h mucus; counte|nance of a yellow tinge, and great dejection of &s;pi|rits; pul&s;e ninety-&s;ix, and weak. Seventh, All his &s;ymptoms &s;eemed aggravated, his pul&s;e one hundred and &s;eventeen. Eighth, He was delirious, and re|quired, at lea&s;t, two attendants to keep him in his cradle; pul&s;e one hundred and forty. Ninth, He was covered with myriads of petechiae, and became extremely offen&s;ive: I was now unable to reckon his pul&s;e. Tenth and Eleventh, His petechiae had run into each other &s;o as to form large blotches. Twelfth, There was a great di&s;charge from his no&s;e and ears, of a very dark colour and very thin. Thirteen and fourteen, The &s;tench from him was offen&s;ive in the extreme. On the fifteenth, he died univer&s;ally convul&s;ed.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Forton Ho&s;pital,</HI> <DATE><HI>Jan.</HI> 17, 1799.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A friend of mine having informed me that you were preparing for the pre&s;s &s;ome additional expe|riments to prove the utility of the nitrous acid fu|migation, in de&s;troying contagion, I take the liberty of &s;ubmitting to your notice &s;ome facts which have occurred to me on this &s;ubject. If you will honour them with a peru&s;al, and think them of &s;ufficient importance, I &s;hall feel my&s;elf highly flattered, &s;hould they, through your &s;anction, become more publicly known.</P>
<P>From the 4th to the 12th of April, 1797, we were employed at this ho&s;pital in receiving pri&s;oners infected with the jail-fever. The&s;e men had recently arrived in &s;ome tran&s;ports from Wales: They form|ed part of a new regiment who had landed there, and who, previous to their &s;ailing from Bre&s;t, had been relea&s;ed from various pri&s;ons in France.</P>
<P>This fever was generally attended with petechiae, and, in &s;ome ca&s;es, the parotids were affected. From the&s;e &s;ymptoms, and from its being highly contagi|ous, it was thought immediately nece&s;&s;ary to fumi|gate with the nitrous acid in greater quantity than we had hitherto done, and in&s;tead of <HI>three</HI> fumi|gating pipkins in each ward, we increa&s;ed them to <HI>&s;ix.</HI> This method appeared to have a very de&s;irable effect, for by filling a fever-ward with the vapour to &s;uch a degree that the &s;malle&s;t part of it could not e&s;cape the influence of the nitrous gas, we ne|ver failed to render the air of that ward &s;weet and refre&s;hing for &s;ome hours. Here I mu&s;t beg leave to remark, notwith&s;tanding the prejudices that are abroad, that I never remember the vapour having appeared too powerful for any fever-patient to bear, and although phthi&s;ically inclined my&s;elf I could al|ways
<PB N="139" REF="036328_0137_1008ED96216E3E28">
ways bear it without inconvenience. If, however, &s;ome inconvenience &s;hould occur, I conceive it only a &s;econdary object of con&s;ideration, when compared with the good effects to be derived from the fumi|gation, in checking contagion.</P>
<P>The increa&s;ed demand for the nitrous vapour, from the number of wards occupied in the ho&s;pital, occa&s;ioned the con&s;umption of nearly three pints of the concentrated vitriolic acid, and a proportionate quantity of the purified nitre, each day. The ex|pen&s;e of &s;o increa&s;ed a con&s;umption, if an object, is certainly over-balanced by the con&s;iderable ad|vantages re&s;ulting from its u&s;e; for, notwith&s;tand|ing fre&s;h contagion was every day brought into the ho&s;pital till the month of July, by means of pri|&s;oners received from the pri&s;on-&s;hips, we had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee the malignity of the fever &s;ub|dued; and by the unremitted attention of the phy|&s;icians of the royal ho&s;pital at Ha&s;lar, with a due ob&s;ervance of cleanline&s;s, we were authori&s;ed early in the month of Augu&s;t, to report to the commi&s;|&s;ioners for &s;ick and wounded &s;eamen, that the jail fever which lately raged among the French pri&s;on|ers at this port, exi&s;ted no longer. The pri&s;oners then, in proportion to their number, enjoyed an u&s;ual &s;hare of health, and which, previous to the introduction of the jail-fever, had been equal to the &s;tate of health of any number of working men in the manufacturing towns of England.</P>
<P>During the continuance of the jail-fever, <HI>very few</HI> of the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the ho&s;pital caught the di&s;temper, con&s;idering the length of time it prevailed at Forton. Tho&s;e who received the contagion fir&s;t, and were fond of drinking, either died, or had a very &s;evere illne&s;s. Others, not &s;o partial to liquor,
<PB N="140" REF="036328_0138_1008ED98A0042AC0">
and who received the infection later, in general recovered.</P>
<P>No putrid di&s;ea&s;e of any con&s;equence made its appearance again in the ho&s;pital until the 3d of Ja|nuary, 1798, when we received &s;ome pri&s;oners from his Maje&s;ty's pri&s;on-&s;hips, Fame and Portland. The&s;e men, who had lately arrived in a tran&s;port from Falmouth, were affected with jail-fever; and on many of them petechiae appeared. I immediately acquainted the commi&s;&s;ioners for &s;ick and wounded &s;eamen of the circum&s;tance, who gave orders to the phy&s;icians of Ha&s;lar ho&s;pital to vi&s;it Forton, and re|port to them accordingly.</P>
<P>At this time the government of France had agreed to victual, clothe, and attend in &s;ickne&s;s, their own pri&s;oners. The &s;ub-contractor in the medical de|partment did not, however, take charge of the ho&s;|pital at Forton, till the 11th of February following. We had, previous to that time, an opportunity of fumigating with the nitrous acid with apparent good effect. The bu&s;ine&s;s of the ho&s;pital from that time, came under the guidance of the French, but al|though they had two hundred and eighty-two pa|tients put under their care, and upwards of one hundred of them affected with putrid fever, the acid vapour was totally di&s;continued for near five months. The &s;tate of the ho&s;pital, from the 11th of February, was highly alarming, and extremely unfavourable to the health of the pri&s;oners; the number on the ho&s;pital books increa&s;ed daily, the wards were &s;o neglected that they &s;oon appeared dirty, and had an offen&s;ive &s;mell; the oeconomy of the buildings was not at all &s;tudied for the advan|tage of the &s;ick; fever and convale&s;cent patients were not &s;eparated, and in the cour&s;e of twenty weeks two hundred and thirty-five pri&s;oners died,
<PB N="141" REF="036328_0139_1008ED9B376DDD78">
five hundred and thirty-&s;even remained &s;ick in the ho&s;pital; and the jail-fever was raging with great violence.</P>
<P>On the 20th of May, Dr. Forzy, and Mr. Bru|net, Surgeon, arrived here from France, who were appointed by the French government, in&s;pectors over their &s;ick and wounded pri&s;oners in England. The&s;e gentlemen were placed at this dep&ocirc;t to &s;ee that ju&s;tice was done to the French pri&s;oners. As they were ver&s;ed in the management of ho&s;pitals, they &s;oon perceived the great inattention that had been paid to the &s;ick; and the irregular manner in which the duty of the ho&s;pital was carried on. They &s;oon convinced Mr. Vochez of this &s;ituation of the &s;ick pri&s;oners, who lo&s;t no time in breaking the con|tract, and putting the management of the ho&s;pital into other hands, thinking it preferable to &s;ubject him&s;elf to the penalties of the law, than that one helple&s;s pri&s;oner &s;hould &s;uffer by the hand of in&s;ati|able avidity and unfeeling neglect; a tran&s;action highly honourable to Mr. Vochez, and the memory of which &s;hould always remain &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed on the minds of tho&s;e who were, or might be be|nefited by it.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t day of July, Dr. Forzy and Mr. Bru|net commenced the management of this ho&s;pital in the medical department. Their chief object was to put the buildings into a general &s;tate of cleanline&s;s, and to fumigate the wards of the ho&s;pital with the nitrous acid. For this purpo&s;e Mr. Vochez very liberally purcha&s;ed all that remained in the Engli&s;h &s;tore, and likewi&s;e &s;ent down from London a large quantity of the concentrated vitriolic acid and puri|fied nitre. The acid vapour, together with the new &s;y&s;tem of cleanline&s;s, at the expiration of even &s;o &s;hort a period as &s;even days, cau&s;ed a very &s;en&s;ible
<PB N="142" REF="036328_0140_1008ED9CCB325540">
change in the appearance of the patients, and the deaths, which during the previous week amounted to <HI>eighteen,</HI> were reduced to <HI>&s;ix</HI> the fir&s;t week after the new admini&s;tration took place. Every &s;ucceed|ing week a more healthy a&s;pect pre&s;ented it&s;elf. At the end of the tenth, the ho&s;pital might be per|ceived to have nearly approached a &s;tate of general convale&s;cence. The number of contagious patients received from Portche&s;ter Ca&s;tle, and the pri&s;on-&s;hips, were indeed con&s;iderably le&s;&s;ened; yet the deaths which had occurred, were <HI>&s;ixty-nine</HI> in num|ber, although the patients in the ho&s;pital were re|duced to two hundred and &s;eventy-three. In the next en&s;uing ten weeks, the deaths decrea&s;ed to thirty-&s;even; the number of patients was two hun|dred and eighty-&s;ix. At this time all contagion had left us, and we had not received a patient with pu|trid fever, from Portche&s;ter or the pri&s;on-&s;hips, for near three weeks; and I have great plea&s;ure in &s;tat|ing, that we have remained in the &s;ame healthy &s;tate ever &s;ince, and have not more than three hun|dred &s;ick in the ho&s;pitals of Forton and Portche&s;ter, though they contain the &s;ick of near ten thou&s;and pri&s;oners at this port.</P>
<P>I cannot help expre&s;&s;ing the great prai&s;e that is due to Dr. Forzy and Mr. Brunet, for their very meri|torious exertions in forming &s;uch &s;alutary arrange|ments, and putting the ho&s;pital into &s;uch excellent di&s;cipline and order, and particularly for their un|common zeal, and the indefatigable pains they took to &s;ee the ho&s;pital well fumigated with the nitrous acid, which there cannot be a doubt was exceeding|ly in&s;trumental in crowning their urgent endeavours with the de&s;ired &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>From the foregoing &s;tatement, I think no one can he&s;itate to be&s;tow the high encomiums that are
<PB N="143" REF="036328_0141_1008ED9F440EBA10">
due on this mo&s;t excellent invention and its ingenious author, to whom every member of &s;ociety &s;hould always think him&s;elf highly indebted.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN an&s;wer to your favour of the 11th in&s;t. I have very little to add to what I have &s;aid in my weekly reports, wherein the obvious difference of thirty the fir&s;t week, and only three the next, being attacked with typhus, I in a great mea&s;ure attribute to the nitrous fumigation, u&s;ed in the way recommended by Dr. J. C. Smyth, from which it al&s;o appears, that of thirteen ill in this latter time, I had only oc|ca&s;ion to &s;end two to the ho&s;pital, and that the infec|tion was &s;o far &s;ubdued, that even nine got well on board, by the emetics, antimonials, &amp;c. u&s;ed in the fir&s;t &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, which I had not been able to accompli&s;h previous to the u&s;e of the nitrous fumigation; I mu&s;t al&s;o add, that the keeping fires con&s;tantly burning, and the &s;ending tho&s;e to the ho&s;|pital who were fir&s;t taken ill, might have &s;ome good effect; but the weather was &s;o ince&s;&s;antly bad, we could not take advantage of wind &s;ails, and indeed laboured under every other inconvenience; the De|fiance's &s;hips company at this time, being on board the Elephant (a &s;eventy-four) as a hulk, in the har|bour.
<PB N="144" REF="036328_0142_1008EDA2A8C604D0">
I imagine that the typhus fever was intro|duced into the &s;hip by women, two of whom I &s;ent on &s;hore as &s;oon as I di&s;covered, one with a &s;carlet eruption, and certain degree of faetor&mdash;Both Dr. Lind and Dr. Hope, are of opinion, the fever was of a very dangerous and infectious nature, and from Dr. Hope's opinion, I was more particularly led to be very attentive in removing the &s;ick early to the ho&s;pital, but the nitrous vapour was &s;carcely u&s;ed two days, when the &s;ymptoms abated, and has now entirely cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>The method I u&s;ed, was by holding the pipkins under the hammocks of tho&s;e with feveri&s;h &s;ymp|toms, and at night, eight were carried about the decks, when all the hammocks and people were be|low, and this was attended with very little inconve|nience to tho&s;e in health. I have al&s;o u&s;ed the ni|trous vapour in the manner mentioned by Mr. Pater|&s;on for ulcers and foul &s;ores, and I think, with obvious good effect, at lea&s;t the patients them&s;elves acknowledged it. I in general have a pot in fumi|gation, when I vi&s;it the &s;ick in the cock-pit, which I really think, independent of the utility of applying &s;ores over it, tends to purify the air and di&s;pel faetor, its &s;moke is particularly plea&s;ant to me, and I often have it in my cabin, when the &s;ick are below. I &s;hall be happy if the&s;e cur&s;ory ob&s;ervations appear to you at all &s;atisfactory.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AGREEABLY to the wi&s;h you expre&s;&s;ed, of being informed of any ob&s;ervations I might happen to make on the effects of the nitrous acid fumigation, in checking or de&s;troying contagion; I have for a con|&s;iderable time pa&s;t, carefully attended to the con&s;i|deration of that &s;ubject, e&s;pecially &s;ince I read Mr. Pater&s;on's ingenious letter addre&s;&s;ed to the Commi&s;|&s;ioners of the Sick and Wounded Board: and al|though I have not been able to draw &s;imilar conclu&s;i|ons, with re&s;pect to its beneficial effects on patients afflicted with ulcers, it is becau&s;e I was le&s;s ob&s;ervant and attentive perhaps, to that point, not having pe|ru&s;ed this gentleman's publication previous to my adopting a more &s;ucce&s;sful mode of treating ulcers, I hope than is generally practi&s;ed or known.</P>
<P>Whether the nitrous vapour has peculiar &s;pecific powers for de&s;troying contagion, is difficult to &s;ay. I have con&s;tantly fumigated the ho&s;pital wards three times a week, &s;ometimes oftener, and I have &s;trong rea&s;on to believe that the nitrous acid fumigation not only tends to prevent the &s;preading of contagion; but an&s;wers other &s;alutary purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Among the various trials I had occa&s;ion to make with the intent of a&s;certaining its effects on putrid effluvia, a circum&s;tance occurred worthy of notice. The water clo&s;et adjoining the agent's office, became in the very hot weather of June and July la&s;t, &s;o ex|tremely offen&s;ive, that Mr. Perrot and his clerks com|plained, that unle&s;s the faetor <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;ome degree removed or mitigated, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to con|tinue much longer in the apartment. It is a room of twelve feet &s;quare: I ordered three pipkins in, and proceeded to fumigate for an hour, filling the place completely with the nitrous vapour. During
<PB N="146" REF="036328_0144_1008EDA8081D8F78">
this period, the door was unavoidably opened &s;everal times; but the agent, two clerks, and my&s;elf, con|tinued there the whole time. It at fir&s;t cau&s;ed a little coughing; but in a few minutes that irritation cea&s;ed, and the vapour became rather grateful than otherwi&s;e. At the end of forty-five minutes, Mr. Gardner one of the clerks, declared he had felt for &s;ome time, an unu&s;ual &s;en&s;ation of hunger, which at the conclu&s;ion was extremely importunate, and he that day ate, as he expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, voraciou&s;ly. Mr. Richards the other clerk, felt nearly &s;imilar ef|fects, though not &s;o much expo&s;ed to the vapour as the former, who kept &s;tirring one of the pipkins frequently. As I did not feel &s;en&s;ations of a &s;imilar nature at the time, I paid little attention to their ob&s;ervations; but on returning home, &s;omewhat better than an hour after, my &s;tomach became equal|ly importunate and craving for food, in &s;o much &s;o, that it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty I could refrain till the u&s;ual hour of dining; and I may venture to &s;ay, that I ate nearly twice my ordinary quantity on that day.</P>
<P>Ten days after this I had the wards more than u&s;ually fumigated, in which I remained till the expi|ration of the proce&s;s, and I felt equally affected with hunger, but although a more than common degree of flatulency attended it. I ought to mention that the agent's apartment was rendered perfectly &s;weet and plea&s;ant, the faetor being wholly removed or de|&s;troyed. Mr. Perrot was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the change, that he reque&s;ted &s;ome days after, to have the fumi|gation repeated, becau&s;e the &s;mell had again become offen&s;ive.</P>
<P>Do not the&s;e facts evince the propriety of diffu&s;ing the nitrous vapour copiou&s;ly in the convale&s;cent wards, where lo&s;s of appetite, and want of tone in
<PB N="147" REF="036328_0145_1008EDAA73C403A0">
the dige&s;tive organs, often retard the perfect re&s;tora|tion of health?</P>
<P>Another circum&s;tance well de&s;erving our regard, with re&s;pect to the effect of the nitrous fumigation on contagion, occurred. Some time ago we had nearly forty patients in the Dutch ho&s;pital dangerou&s;ly ill with typhus fever; old men who had been recently captured in the Greenland &s;hips, and who laboured under great dejection of &s;pirits. They were taken ill in the pri&s;ons, &s;hortly after their arrival at Nor|man-Cro&s;s, and although we had a great many pati|ents with &s;light complaints in the ho&s;pital, on the admi&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e with typhus fever, yet not one of them, nor of the nur&s;es, caught the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>This was not the ca&s;e in the pri&s;ons, for &s;everal of the old &s;tandards there, were attacked with the fe|ver. During the continuance of the di&s;ea&s;e, we were unremitting in our attention to fumigate the wards of the ho&s;pital daily, with the addition of &s;everal pipkins more than were commonly employed.</P>
<P>Are we not warranted then, in concluding that the&s;e prophylactic mea&s;ures, prevented the contagion from &s;preading and infecting the patients in the ho&s;|pital; whil&s;t tho&s;e in the pri&s;ons not having equal advantages, were attacked with the fever?</P>
<P>We were however fortunate enough to lo&s;e no more than one patient, who died on the &s;eventh day in a highly putrid &s;tate; a clear proof of the malig|nant tendency, and contagious nature of the di&s;or|der.</P>
<P>I could enumerate a variety of other in&s;tances, where it appeared to me that the nitrous acid fumi|gation was attended with &s;alutary effects; but what has been already &s;aid is, I hope, &s;ufficient to &s;hew that many benefits are likely to accrue from a more exten&s;ive u&s;e of this medicine; and that it ought
<PB N="148" REF="036328_0146_1008EDAE262DF4D0">
almo&s;t on every occa&s;ion, to have the preference to all other modes of fumigating, where contagion is prevalent.</P>
<P>It might certainly be u&s;ed with much propriety and advantage in the &s;ick births, and between decks, on board his Maje&s;ty's &s;hips of war. It is true, where great moi&s;ture prevails, which is unavoidably the ca&s;e in men of war, fires are ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary; after which the nitrous gas &s;hould be liberally diffu&s;ed throughout the &s;hip: but prejudice, which frequently warps the be&s;t under&s;tanding, prevents many from adopting &s;alutary mea&s;ures, becau&s;e the&s;e means had not been originally &s;ugge&s;ted by them|&s;elves, or becau&s;e they happen to militate again&s;t &s;ome preconceived and favourite opinion.</P>
<P>But before gentlemen decide on any remedy held out to the public in a fair and candid manner, they &s;hould fir&s;t &s;ubject this remedy to actual experiment, and then determine for or again&s;t it, according to the unprejudiced re&s;ult.</P>
<P>I do not pretend to &s;ay that the nitrous acid ought to &s;uper&s;ede all other preventive remedies; on the contrary, ventilation and cleanline&s;s mu&s;t likewi&s;e be conjoined with it: but where contagious fever prevails, there is every rea&s;on to believe that the&s;e will prove the mo&s;t effectual external means to &s;ub|due it.</P>
<P>I thought it my duty to &s;ay thus much in ju&s;tice to the ingenious inventor of the nitrous acid fumi|gation.</P>

<HEAD>Extract of a Letter from JOHN SNIPE, <ABBR>E&s;q.</ABBR> formerly Surgeon of the Sandwich, now Surgeon to the Na|val Ho&s;pital at Yarmouth. Dated Yarmouth, June 17, 1798.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 9th of March, when I joined the Sand|wich, a contagious fever raged in that &s;hip, there were daily ten, twelve, or fifteen men &s;ent to the ho&s;pital with fever and ulcerated legs. You are al|ready acquainted with the &s;teps that were taken to &s;ubdue this. Our &s;ucce&s;s I attribute to cleanline&s;s, free ventilation, and the diffu&s;ing daily the nitrous gas through every part of the &s;hip, and I am con|vinced, that had that &s;hip been fumigated three or four times a week, with the nitrous vapour, no &s;uch fever would ever have been generated, notwith|&s;tanding the great number of men that were on board. Suffice it to &s;ay, that in three months, this &s;hip was as healthy as any other of her cla&s;s, al|though we never had le&s;s than 1000 and often 1500 men on board. During the la&s;t twelve weeks that &s;he was in commi&s;&s;ion, I only &s;ent eight men to the ho&s;pital. When I fir&s;t joined her, the &s;malle&s;t &s;cratch rapidly degenerated into a foul ulcer, but after the febrile contagion was &s;ubdued, &s;ores heal|ed as kindly as in any other &s;hip.</P>
<P>About three weeks before &s;he was paid off, an Italian cut one of the &s;eamen in the thigh with his knife, the wound was about &s;ix inches long, and nearly two deep, it was &s;titched up, and a double-headed roller applied; it healed by the fir&s;t in|tention, which was a proof that no contagion re|mained in the &s;hip.</P>
<P>From &s;ome experiments I have made, I am in|duced to think that febrile contagion, and the ge|neral exhalations from the human body, are of an
<PB N="150" REF="036328_0148_1008EDB2214DFC58">
alkaline nature, and that the nitrous vapour equally &s;ubtile, penetrating into every crevice or corner, wherever it meets the former, de&s;troys its pe&s;tiferous qualities, and renders it as inactive as a drop of water. I have repeatedly conden&s;ed the breath and per&s;piration of patients in typhus fever, and upon adding an acid to it, an efferve&s;cence was vi&s;ible: the method I took to obtain a &s;ufficient quantity of liquid for the experiment, was to make the patients breathe on cold panes of gla&s;s, and to put the &s;ame under the bed-clothes, clo&s;e to the &s;kin, when in a &s;tate of per&s;piration; in this way half an ounce may be procured in a &s;hort time.</P>
<P>Fumigating with the nitrous vapour cannot be too &s;trongly recommended on board of all &s;hips, in barracks, ho&s;pitals, pri&s;ons, clo&s;e cellars, and hou&s;es that are not con&s;tantly inhabited. Some time ago I had occa&s;ion to go to a &s;tore room, that had not been looked into for three weeks or a month, it contained the bedding u&s;ed by the Dutch pri&s;oners before they were &s;ent to Holland, the whole of which had been fumigated, expo&s;ed to the &s;un for two days, afterwards wa&s;hed and perfectly dried before they were put in &s;tore; yet the room &s;melled very badly. I immediately ordered it to be fumigated with &s;ix pipkins, and next morning it &s;melled perfectly &s;weet: for which rea&s;on I have, and mean to fumigate all the &s;tore-rooms, every week.</P>
<P>La&s;t winter I tried the nitrous vapour with &s;ome of the wor&s;t ulcers that perhaps were ever &s;een in any country; the pipkins were placed under the naked &s;ores. It gave &s;ome pain, and I could not ob|&s;erve any good effects from it, but I beg leave to ob|&s;erve that this was not the fault of the remedy, but the untractable nature of the di&s;ea&s;e, for in many ca&s;es, no internal medicine, nor external application,
<PB N="151" REF="036328_0149_1008EDB40BE0B1F8">
had the lea&s;t effect, amputation alone &s;aved the pa|tient's life. I mentioned this in a letter to Dr. Blane, at the time, but &s;ince then, I have found it of e&s;&s;en|tial &s;ervice in cleaning foul ulcers, buboes, and &s;tumps; and I do not he&s;itate to give it as my opi|nion, that if it is properly applied in time, it will be found to be of more &s;ervice than mo&s;t of the ex|ternal applications that are at pre&s;ent u&s;ed. You are well aware that in many ca&s;es, we have to lament the failure of every exertion.</P>
<P>It is with heartfelt plea&s;ure I &s;ay, that I have lo&s;t very few in fevers, &s;ince I have been at Yarmouth, although we have received a great number in the low typhus fever into the ho&s;pital&punc; nor is there one in|&s;tance of the contagion being communicated to the &s;urrounding patients, which I attribute to the nitrous gas, cleanline&s;s and free ventilation.</P>
<P>When the wards were filled with the nitrous va|pour, patients who had weak lungs, coughed vio|lently at fir&s;t, but they breathed more freely after|wards, e&s;pecially if the atmo&s;phere was thick and heavy, but I never ob&s;erved any bad effects from it, even with patients in the la&s;t &s;tage of con&s;umption. The nitrous vapour has a mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing effect in correcting the faetor in the wards, ari&s;ing from ex|ten&s;ive bad ulcers: this alone is a great comfort both to the patients and attendants. I have &s;o high an opinion of the nitrous vapour for de&s;troying conta|gion, and as a corrector of foul air, that I have in the &s;tronge&s;t manner recommended the u&s;e of it to &s;everal of my friends, in the different factories in the Mediterranean.</P>
<P>There are many navy &s;urgeons prejudiced again&s;t the nitrous fumigation, be&s;ides it gives &s;ome trou|ble, which will at all times operate powerfully with the indolent.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="036328_0150_1008EDB840A05EB0">
Much prai&s;e is due to the ingenious author of the nitrous vapour. I have not the honour of his ac|quaintance, nor did I ever read a word he wrote (for which I blu&s;h) on the &s;ubject, but I &s;hould be want|ing in candour if I did not faithfully relate facts as I found them; and in my opinion, the nitrous va|pour tends greatly to de&s;troy contagion, and is a mo&s;t powerful corrector of foul air. Query, Whe|ther or not does it give an additional quantity of oxygen (pabulum vitae) to the &s;urrounding atmo&s;|phere, where it is diffu&s;ed.</P>
<P>I do not expect to have fewer patients in the ho&s;|pital than we have at pre&s;ent: there are fifty-three &s;hips of war employed in the North Sea, and they never go to Sheerne&s;s but when in want of repairs. When the fleet comes in, I expect to get fifty or &s;ix|ty fre&s;h patients, and they are weekly &s;ending in &s;ick by the frigates and cutters. There are only two men in the ho&s;pital that were wounded in Lord Dun|can's action, and the bad ulcers that were received la&s;t winter are mo&s;tly gone, yet the number is &s;till kept up. There are more ca&s;es of ulcer received into this ho&s;pital, in proportion, than into the two royal ho&s;pitals, ulcers as well as pectoral complaints being more frequent in the North Sea, than in the Channel. I have al&s;o remarked that tho&s;e who had the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate ulcers had been for &s;ome years during the war in the Ea&s;t or We&s;t Indies, or in the Mediterranean.</P>
<P>I have an ample field here for ob&s;ervation, but little time to put my ob&s;ervations on paper, as be|tween the ho&s;pital, &s;ick quarters, and pri&s;on, I am kept con&s;tantly employed.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NOT having taken minutes of any ob&s;ervations I may have forwarded to you on the &s;ubject of the nitrous vapour, I am not enabled to &s;tate with the preci&s;ion I could wi&s;h, the particulars relating there|to.&mdash;At the time we began to u&s;e the nitrous vapour as a fumigation, our ho&s;pitals were free from any contagious di&s;ea&s;e, and on the whole, as healthy as I ever knew them. But we never had &s;o long a con|tinuance of that healthy &s;tate, as while this vapour was u&s;ed in the ho&s;pital; and it de&s;erves notice, that &s;oon after it was di&s;continued, under the French ad|mini&s;tration, the typhus fever again made its appear|ance with con&s;iderable &s;everity. No in&s;tance, to the be&s;t of my recollection, has occurred of that di&s;ea&s;e being communicated either to nur&s;e or patient, whil&s;t the nitrous fumigation was employed; whereas many in&s;tances occurred from time to time, previous to its u&s;e. The difference on entering a &s;urgery ward, after u&s;ing the fumigation, is more remarkable than any other, as it deprives tho&s;e wards of the &s;mell peculiar to them. I have al&s;o remarked, that fewer patients, with exten&s;ive ulcers, whil&s;t this was u&s;ed, became hectic, than formerly. In regard to con|&s;umptive patients, I am not at pre&s;ent qualified to &s;peak decidedly from any proofs I recollect of its ef|fects, but judging from analogy, I am induced to believe that patients of this de&s;cription are as likely to receive relief (in &s;o far at lea&s;t as the nature of the complaint admits) as patients in any other di&s;ea&s;e; for whatever di&s;lodges from the air, or corrects the noxious particles accumulated from the effluvia of di&s;ea&s;ed bodies, mu&s;t mitigate the &s;ymptoms of this
<PB N="154" REF="036328_0152_1008EDBC8170D5E0">
di&s;ea&s;e. No arguments I am ma&s;ter of can induce the French &s;urgeons to adopt it; they complain of its exciting cough, and injuring the catarrhal com|plaints. They content them&s;elves with burning a few pounds of juniper berries, daily in each ho&s;pital, notwith&s;tanding the effect of the di&s;continuance of the former practice, has been evident enough to con|vince any unprejudiced per&s;on which de&s;erves the preference. On the whole, I infer, that the <HI>nitrous vapour</HI> is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;trong anti&s;eptic qualities&mdash;is capable of being admini&s;tered in every di&s;ea&s;e&mdash;can be procured with facility in all places&mdash;requires no extra information in the operator; and, in &s;hort, is the be&s;t fumigation I am acquainted with, to be em|ployed where the patients remain in the wards.</P>

<HEAD>Letter from Captain Lane, of the Navy. Dated Ply|mouth, June 19, 1798.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING been particularly engaged with the Ad|miral for &s;ome days pa&s;t, I have not been able to an|&s;wer your letter before, otherwi&s;e I &s;hould not have been &s;o tardy in expre&s;&s;ing the &s;atisfaction I feel, in offering my te&s;timony of the apparent advantages de|rived from fumigating with the nitrous acid, in check|ing at lea&s;t, if not in &s;topping contagion. Had I &s;uppo&s;ed that the &s;malle&s;t doubt remained on the
<PB N="155" REF="036328_0153_1008EDBF360D18E0">
&s;ubject, I &s;hould have kept a very minute account of every experiment, but as I conceived the thing to have been uncontrovertibly proved before, I &s;a|tisfied my&s;elf with having recour&s;e to it, whenever there was any appearance of occa&s;ion for &s;o doing, and I can with &s;afety &s;ay, without ever having been di&s;appointed. On receipt of your letter, I imme|diately &s;ent it to Mr. Harris, who has returned it to me, and who I find is exactly in the &s;ame predica|ment as my&s;elf, having been prevented making any particular remarks, by entertaining the &s;ame opinion of its efficacy as I had, and having been equally &s;a|tisfied with the re&s;ult of his experiments.</P>
<P>With regard to the comparative degree of &s;ickne&s;s between the pri&s;ons and &s;hips, I mu&s;t refer you to the weekly returns. I can however &s;ay, that when I fir&s;t obtained Dr. Smyth's fumigating materials for the latter, a typhus fever was raging on board the <HI>Prudent,</HI> which in Mr. Harris's opinion, was &s;o far alarming as to induce me to remove the people from her for a few days, during which time I had her twice fumigated and the decks white-wa&s;hed, after which, the &s;ame pri&s;oners were returned to her, and &s;he has &s;ince been as healthy as the other &s;hips. When it is con&s;idered how hot the weather has been, and that I have at times been obliged to put as ma|ny as 600 pri&s;oners in the &s;ixty-fours, I am induced to attribute the pre&s;ervation of their health, to the effect of the fumigation, which regularly takes place every Thur&s;day morning in all the &s;hips when the weather permits, having long &s;ince e&s;tabli&s;hed a &s;ig|nal to en&s;ure its never being neglected in any of them. With re&s;pect to the pri&s;on and ho&s;pital, I am inform|ed by Mr. Harris that whil&s;t he had the materials for the nitrous fumigation, it was made u&s;e of when wanted, and always with the de&s;ired effect, but on

the French government taking charge of the &s;ick, the fumigating materials were returned to the Royal ho&s;pitals along with the other &s;tores.</P>
<P>Sorry I am indeed not to have it in my power to be more particular, for nothing can be more &s;atis|factorily proved in my mind, than the efficacy of Dr. Smyth's means of checking, if not of de&s;troy|ing contagion, and I cannot but congratulate that gentleman on a di&s;covery which I certainly con&s;ider as highly beneficial to mankind, as it mu&s;t be grate|ful to his feelings.</P>

<SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am now to acknowledge your obliging favour of the 17th of February la&s;t, to which I did not give an immediate an&s;wer, being engaged in the ex|periment on board the Union, which I undertook at the reque&s;t of the Lords Commi&s;&s;ioners of the
<PB N="165" REF="036328_0162_1008EDD6FB8B5CC8">
Admiralty, and the re&s;ult of which I was de&s;irous to communicate to you, as the be&s;t and mo&s;t &s;atis|factory reply I could give to your letter. I de|&s;ired Mr. John&s;on to &s;end you a copy of my pam|phlet on that &s;ubject, as &s;oon as it was printed. Although I have been prevented from writing to you till now, owing to a variety of engagements and bu&s;ine&s;s, which it is needle&s;s here to explain, I can a&s;&s;ure you I have not been forgetful of the be|nevolent undertaking of your Board of Health, which reflects &s;o much honour on the gentlemen en|gaged in it, and to which I &s;hall be at all times happy to contribute any a&s;&s;i&s;tance in my power to give. The very limited &s;phere of contagion is &s;o well a&s;certained, that I have occa&s;ion to &s;ay little on the &s;ubject. In my book on the jail-fever, I have mentioned, after many year's experience as phy&s;ician to an Ho&s;pital, into which more typhus fevers were admitted in proportion than into any other, that the mo&s;t highly contagious fevers, that occur in our ho&s;pitals, do not affect the patients in general, lodged in the &s;ame ward; for we had no appropriate fever wards; nor did I ever &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity for &s;uch, as the communication of infecti|on was in general ea&s;ily prevented by the means I employed. I have al&s;o mentioned, that there is no, or very trifling ri&s;k of contagious fevers being propagated in the open air, &s;till le&s;s from one room or ward to another; and that I never knew contagion propagated by a dead body, even from the di&s;&s;ection of it, unle&s;s by inoculation. But, in|dependently of all the&s;e ob&s;ervations, the fumigati|on with the nitrous acid, if properly employed, not only certainly de&s;troys contagion, but improves greatly the atmo&s;pheric air, by &s;upplying a quan|tity of dephlogi&s;ticated air, or oxygen gas; and it
<PB N="166" REF="036328_0163_1008EDD88ED610B0">
effectually de&s;troys all offen&s;ive &s;mell. I al&s;o, as you mu&s;t have ob&s;erved, u&s;e the diluted marine acid for wa&s;hing the floors, bed&s;teads, &amp;c. and put ma|rine acid in the pails of water u&s;ed for immer&s;ing the foul linen, &amp;c. In bed-chambers and private apartments I generally keep up, where there is a contagious di&s;ea&s;e, a con&s;tant fumigation; which can ea&s;ily be done by means of a lamp, over which is placed a china cup or &s;aucer, with oil of vitriol and nitre, an ounce and a half or two ounces of each being &s;ufficient for twenty-four hours. If you have any queries to put to me, I need hardly a&s;&s;ure you, that I &s;hall take a plea&s;ure in an&s;wering them, and at all times of convincing you of the regard and e&s;teem of, my dear Sir,</P>

<SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I am this moment favoured with your letter of the 30th of July. I can have no objection to your making any u&s;e, public or private, of my letter to you. The accuracy of the facts I will be an&s;wera|ble for; but as it was a private communication to a particular friend, I was little attentive to &s;tyle or manner. Re&s;pecting the limited &s;phere of conta|gion I &s;aid the le&s;s, as I con&s;idered it a matter &s;o well a&s;certained, and by &s;uch a body of evidence, as required no additional proof. Mankind have been led into error, on this &s;ubject, by confound|ing
<PB N="167" REF="036328_0164_1008EDDA79D079E0">
under the general name of contagious or epi|demic, di&s;ea&s;es of very different natures and origin. But of all tho&s;e contagions, that are propagated from one di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;on, or his clothes, to another per&s;on, the &s;phere of the deleterious power is in general &s;o extremely limited, that there have been, and &s;till are, &s;ome phy&s;icians, who believe they are only propagated by contact. At Winche&s;ter, dur|ing my &s;tay there, one &s;oldier only, whil&s;t doing duty on the pri&s;oners in the airing-ground, was &s;eized with the di&s;temper; and very few of the military &s;uffered, although the guard-room was im|mediately under one of the pri&s;on-wards, and the &s;entinels mixed with the pri&s;oners even in the courts and pa&s;&s;ages of the king's hou&s;e or pri&s;on. And lately, on board the Union, none of the officers &s;uffered, and few of the petty-officers; nor would the &s;hip's company have &s;uffered &s;o &s;everely as they did, could their intercour&s;e with the nur&s;es and a&s;|&s;i&s;tants in the ho&s;pital have been prevented. But, independently of the limited &s;phere of contagion, I will venture to en&s;ure even the nur&s;es and ho&s;pital a&s;&s;i&s;tants, in any &s;ituation, if they will be induced to u&s;e the proper precautions, and if the ho&s;pital is properly fumigated; the wards &s;prinkled with di|luted marine acid; the dirty linen, &amp;c. immediate|ly immer&s;ed in pails, filled with cold water impreg|nated with marine acid; the chamber-pots, &s;oil-tubs, &amp;c. quickly removed and wa&s;hed with the &s;ame; the bed&s;teads wa&s;hed every time they are empty with the diluted marine acid; and the bed|clothes fumigated with the nitrous vapour. In ho&s;|pitals crowded with &s;ick, in &s;hips, pri&s;ons, &amp;c. it is nece&s;&s;ary to fumigate completely every part of the &s;hip, pri&s;on, &amp;c. twice a day. But in common ca&s;es, and in private practice, &s;uch means are not
<PB N="168" REF="036328_0165_1008EDDE1F8D35A0">
nece&s;&s;ary; and one, two, or three fumigating lamps, in which a con&s;tant fumigation is kept up, night and day, &s;o as to pa&s;s over the beds of the &s;ick, are perfectly &s;ufficient. In this manner I have not only &s;topped the common contagion in the ho&s;pital and in private, but I have equally &s;ucceed|ed, which is of great con&s;equence to be known, in preventing the &s;carlatina angino&s;a, or putrid &s;ore throat, from being communicated to the re&s;t of the family, living under the &s;ame roof. Whether this will apply to the &s;mall-pox, I cannot &s;ay from my own experience; but I have been told by Dr. Rol|lo, Surgeon to the Artillery, and Mr. Cruick|&s;hank, Profe&s;&s;or Royal of Chemi&s;try to the Acade|my, that it de&s;troys the <HI>mia&s;ma</HI> of the &s;mall-pox; and that of two quantities of matter, taken for the purpo&s;e of inoculation, one was expo&s;ed to the ni|trous vapour, the other not: the per&s;ons inoculated with the fir&s;t were not &s;eized with the di&s;ea&s;e, whil&s;t the inoculation took the u&s;ual effect, when performed with the &s;econd.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>WHOEVER reads the preceding pages with attention, mu&s;t be &s;truck with the great conformity of opinion, ob&s;ervable among&s;t the different indivi|duals, in regard to the principal object of our in|quiry, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the power of the nitrous vapour to de|&s;troy contagion.</P>
<P>But although the &s;ame &s;entiment univer&s;ally pre|vails, I cannot help remarking, that whil&s;t the opi|nion of &s;ome gentlemen is founded on general ob&s;er|vation alone, the opinion of others is &s;upported by &s;uch an accurate detail of facts reduced to the cer|tainty of arithmetical calculation, as carry with them a conviction, little &s;hort of demon&s;tration it|&s;elf.</P>
<P>The power of the nitrous vapour on contagion once e&s;tabli&s;hed, all its other effects can ea&s;ily be under&s;tood and explained; one of the mo&s;t obvious of the&s;e is its de&s;troying putrid &s;mell. Although I am far from imagining that putrid &s;mell and con|tagion are one and the &s;ame, on the contrary, am convinced that they often exi&s;t independent of each other, yet as they are of the &s;ame family, and ari&s;e from a common cau&s;e, we may fairly &s;uppo&s;e from analogy, that what de&s;troys the one, will prove effectual in de&s;troying the other. I confe&s;s, that where there is a direct and po&s;itive proof, as in the
<PB N="170" REF="036328_0167_1008EDE30A4BAA78">
pre&s;ent in&s;tance, rea&s;oning from analogy is of little con&s;equence. The ob&s;ervation, however, is in it|&s;elf important, particularly for tho&s;e who&s;e duty leads them to an attendance on the &s;ick, as the of|fen&s;ive &s;mell to which they are expo&s;ed, con&s;titutes not the lea&s;t di&s;agreeable part of &s;uch an office.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides removing the offen&s;ive &s;mell of ho&s;|pitals and pri&s;ons, another advantage of the ni|trous fumigation is that of rendering the air purer and &s;itter for the purpo&s;es of animal life; a fact which chemi&s;try readily explains. From it we learn, that in the decompo&s;ition of nitre by the vi|triolic acid, a certain proportion of vital air,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In an&s;wer to Dr. Smyth's que&s;tion, What is the proportion of oxygen and nitric acid, di&s;engaged by add|ing half an ounce of oil of vitriol to half an ounce of nitre? I reply that I do not recollect any experiment which has been publi&s;hed to a&s;certain the proportion of oxygenous air thus extricated, though the fact of its extrication is well known, &amp;c.&mdash;<HI>Extract of a Letter from Mr. Keir of Bir|mingham.</HI></NOTE> or oxygen gas, is let loo&s;e; and phy&s;iology informs us, that this air, which con&s;titutes a very intere&s;t|ing part of our atmo&s;phere, is nece&s;&s;ary for the re&s;piration of animals, at the &s;ame time that it is con&s;tantly con&s;umed by it.</P>
<P>In a former publication I did not he&s;itate to give a decided opinion, (judging partly from experience, and partly from the &s;imilarity of putrid contagions) that the nitrous vapour would be found equally an antidote to all,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This fact becomes the more important, it being now clearly a&s;certained, that the yellow fever, in America at lea&s;t, is produced by imported contagion. The advantage to a commercial country of being able to counteract all com|munications of this kind, without &s;ubjecting the merchant to the expen&s;e and delay of quarantines, is hardly to be calcu|lated.</NOTE> even to the plague it&s;elf. I have
<PB N="171" REF="036328_0168_1008EDE5AA284450">
now the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee this opinion confirmed, in &s;o far at lea&s;t, as relates to the dy&s;entery, a pu|trid di&s;ea&s;e equally contagious with the jail fever, and in military ho&s;pitals, at lea&s;t, &s;till more fatal.</P>
<P>The efficacy, however, of the nitrous vapour, as appears from almo&s;t the whole of the reports, is not confined to the de&s;troying or preventing the com|munication of contagion; its &s;alutary influence is no le&s;s remarkable on the &s;ick and on tho&s;e recovering from &s;ickne&s;s; but on this very important &s;ubject, I could wi&s;h the reader to con&s;ult Mr. Pater&s;on's Table of the Weekly Returns at Forton Ho&s;pital, from which it appears, that during the &s;hort &s;pace of &s;ix weeks, in an ho&s;pital containing from 300 to 400 men, there was a difference, from employing the nitrous fumigation, of about 50 lives &s;aved, and about 110 men re&s;tored to a &s;tate of health fit for active duty; but if the reader is de&s;irous of forming an accurate judgement of the immediate effect of the nitrous vapour on tho&s;e ill of typhus fever, I would advi&s;e him to read with attention, what Mr. M'Gri|gor and Mr. Hill have written on the &s;ubject.&mdash;By Mr. M'Grigor we are told, that &s;ome years back, during the prevalence of a fever &s;imilar to the one he de&s;cribes, in the &s;ame place, the i&s;land of Jer&s;ey, the 88th regiment to which he belongs, in the &s;pace of ten weeks, &s;uffered a lo&s;s of 40 or 50 men; where|as during the pre&s;ent illne&s;s, when he employed the nitrous fumigation, of 64 men &s;eized with the fever, he did not lo&s;e a &s;ingle patient. He further re|marks, that by u&s;ing con&s;tantly the nitrous vapour, the malignant &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e di&s;appeared, and that from a typhus it became a &s;imple fever.</P>
<P>But of all the advantages to be derived from the u&s;e of the nitrous vapour, none is more remarkable or likely to be of &s;uch exten&s;ive application as its ef|fect
<PB N="172" REF="036328_0169_1008EDE827257C00">
on ulcers, an effect fir&s;t taken notice of by Mr. Pater&s;on, and which has been confirmed, upon every &s;ub&s;equent trial.</P>
<P>That the nitrous vapour, by correcting the malig|nant and contagious air of ho&s;pitals, which is known to affect<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Having related the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing marks of this fever, I &s;hall only add, that there are &s;ometimes &s;light de|grees of it hardly to be characterized; and which can only be di&s;covered in full ho&s;pitals, by ob&s;erving the men to langui&s;h, though the nature of illne&s;s for which they came in &s;hould &s;eem to admit of a &s;peedier cure. In &s;uch ca&s;es the only &s;ymptoms are &s;light head-achs, a whiti&s;h tongue, want of appetite, and other incon&s;iderable feveri&s;h &s;ymp|toms. Vid.

Tho&s;e per&s;ons who are too precipitate in general conclu&s;i|ons, have commonly &s;ome ground to go back again.</P>
<P>Were I to form a conjecture re&s;pecting the kind of ulcers in which the nitric acid, either in a gaze|ous or liquid &s;tate, is likely to be found mo&s;t &s;er|viceable; I &s;hould &s;ay, the &s;loughy or &s;phacelous, the &s;crophulous, and the &s;corbutic: but tho&s;e gen|tlemen, who are profe&s;&s;ionally engaged in the treat|ment
<PB N="173" REF="036328_0170_1008EDEAA878D700">
of &s;uch complaints, will look upon this ob&s;er|vation more as a hint than an opinion.</P>
<P>The preceding effects of the nitrous vapour are what have been ob&s;erved by all or by many; but there is one which re&s;ts as yet on the authority of Mr. Pater&s;on alone. He only has made trial of it, and with &s;ucce&s;s, in the hooping-cough. His re|marks on this &s;ubject, I mu&s;t &s;ay, are extremely in|tere&s;ting, and open a wide field for the reflexion and experience of the practical phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>Having fini&s;hed the few ob&s;ervations I had to of|fer, on the letters and reports which I have now the honour to lay before the public; the reader I hope will pardon me if I detain him a few minutes longer, to make one remark which relates principally to my|&s;elf. It cannot have e&s;caped his notice any more than it has done mine, that, as appears by &s;everal of the letters, there are prejudices entertained again&s;t the nitrous fumigation by many &s;urgeons of the navy. At this I am by no means &s;urpri&s;ed; we are all children of habit, and unwilling to relinqui&s;h opinions which we entertained in early life: the in|troduction, however, of the nitrous fumigation into the navy, has been oppo&s;ed not by prejudice only, but by arguments drawn from chemi&s;try. It would be no very difficult ta&s;k for me to point out the fal|lacy of &s;uch chemical rea&s;oning, but to endeavour to refute by argument what is directly contrary to experience and ob&s;ervation, would be an abu&s;e of time, and an in&s;ult to the public judgment. The only an&s;wer then that I &s;hall give to &s;uch philo&s;ophers, is to addre&s;s them in the words of an author, who&s;e opinion mu&s;t be con&s;idered of high authority on &s;uch a &s;ubject, as he was not only a phy&s;ician of charac|ter, but certainly one of the fir&s;t chemi&s;ts in Europe; the circum&s;tances and occa&s;ions were perfectly &s;imilar.
