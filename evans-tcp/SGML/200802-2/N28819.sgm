<P>COLUMBIA this day &s;its a di&s;con&s;olate mourner at the tomb, "weeping for her WASHING|TON, and will not be comforted, becau&s;e he is not."&mdash; Death, regardle&s;s of his intrin&s;ic worth, and his accumu|lated honors, has laid him low in the du&s;t. That heart, which once glowed with cele&s;tial fire, has cea&s;ed to beat, and the &s;hadows of the long night &s;tretch over his remains. The remembrance of his goodne&s;s, and of his greatne&s;s, however, like the mild glory of the evening &s;un, &s;heds a placid influence of delight over the &s;oul, and &s;oftens it to tender regret. What tho' he has re&s;ted from his labours, his works do follow him, and proclaim a aloud his excellence. His memory is embalmed in our bo&s;oms, and forces from us the grateful, tho' feeble tribute of a tear&mdash;HE was, under GOD, the Grand <HI>agent</HI> in connecting us, and pre&s;erving us&mdash; in animating us, and controuling us, during the critical period of our national infancy.&mdash;Rivalling the glory of ancient and modern names, in heroi&s;m &amp; &s;kill, he far &s;urpa&s;&s;ed them in hu|manene&s;s &mdash;in integrity&mdash;in di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s. Combining in him&s;elf every requi&s;ite for a model, as a Citizen, Soldier and State&s;man, HE was one of tho&s;e extraordinary per&s;onages, who &s;eem born to effect great and &s;urprizing revolutions.</P>
<P>By nature fierce, and violent in his di&s;po&s;ition, his fir&s;t conte&s;t was with him&s;elf. Fortunately for his country, his judgment gained the victory over his pa&s;&s;ions. This pav|ed the way for his future greatne&s;s&mdash;for who &s;o fit to com|mand others, as HE who can command him&s;elf.&mdash;Thus calm and &s;elf collected, prudence, firmne&s;s and moderation char|acterized every action&mdash;He had but few confidants&mdash;depen|ding upon the re&s;ources of his own mind. His judgment &s;eldom deceived him&mdash;as his perception was clear, rapid and true.&mdash;His bo&s;om was a &s;tranger to envy&mdash;at lea&s;t HE never gave occa&s;ion for &s;lander to fa&s;ten an imputation of this kind upon his character&mdash;He cheri&s;hed talents where he &s;aw them, and prai&s;ed men when it was their due. Though
<PB N="4" REF="038421_0004_1011E92E9B7AE980" MS="y">
his <HI>own</HI> merit was di&s;tingui&s;hed, and commanded univer&s;al admiration and love, yet was HE una&s;&s;uming. He rather retired from, than obtruded him&s;elf upon, public view&mdash;and when HE did appear, it was the un&s;olicited voice of his country that had called him.</P>
<P>View him in the walks of dome&s;tic life. Order and re|gularity prevailed throughout his hou&s;ehold. Strangers, who vi&s;ited Mount Vernon, &s;aw contentment &amp; tranquility pictur|ed in every &s;cene. Here licentiou&s;ne&s;s was a &s;tranger, and im|morality obliged to a&s;&s;ume a virtuous di&s;gui&s;e. Such was WASHINGTON's force of character, that the profligate bowed before it, and approved what they could not imitate. HE profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a <HI>Chri&s;tian!</HI> And who will attach to him the imputation of hypocri&s;y? His &s;trong capacious mind, no doubt, &s;aw the <HI>weakne&s;s</HI> of infideli|ty, which, to &s;upport its cau&s;e, mu&s;t overturn all evidence, and re&s;t upon &s;peculation&mdash;uncertain as the "ba&s;ele&s;s fabric of a vi&s;ion;" and his moral principles cannot but have &s;hrunk back from a view of infidel practices&mdash;for where infidelity commences, &s;trict morality generally cea&s;es&mdash;it then a&s;|&s;umes the form of an accommodating, a ver&s;atile philo&s;ophy, encouraging the unre&s;trained enjoyment of every vice.&mdash; Convinced that no &s;ociety could exi&s;t without <HI>religion,</HI> we heard him uniformly recommend it to his fellow-citizens&mdash;and would to GOD! that they who are now &s;o furiou&s;ly zealous, for his name, as to clamor merely for &s;ins of omi&s;&s;ion again&s;t WASHINGTON, would &s;o far reverence his memory, as, in this particular, to obey his precept.&mdash;It was a precept &s;anc|tioned by <HI>example.</HI> He not only joined in the &s;acred rites of <HI>religion</HI>&mdash;but he al&s;o preformed tho&s;e actions, which, as a member of &s;ociety, as well as a Chri&s;tian, he was bound to do&mdash;thus connecting what our divine Savior emphatically call "works of &s;acrifice with works of mercy." To the &s;tranger he was ho&s;pitable&mdash;to the poor, charitable&mdash;to his equals, dignified&mdash;to his inferiors, affable&mdash;to his friends, kindly affectionate&mdash;and in his dealings <HI>an hone&s;t man.</HI> Ble&s;|&s;ed with tho&s;e rare qualifications which entitled him at all times to govern, when his lot came to be governed, we be|held in him the prompt and obedient <HI>Citizen.</HI> To the laws and con&s;tituted authorities he ever paid that re&s;pect which was due. In his enlarged view, every &s;ituation in life, where virtue ruled, was honorable&mdash;With him, in fine, nothing hu|man was too little, becau&s;e nothing human was too great!</P>
<P>But, my fellow-citizens, it was not in the private walks of life that our WASHINGTON di&s;covered his &s;ingular and ex|alted
<PB N="5" REF="038421_0005_1011E9331315DD40" MS="y">
talents. Had he not appeared on a more con&s;picuous theatre, he would have had many rivals in worth&mdash;'Tis not a calm &s;ea, a mild &s;ky&mdash;but it is the &s;torm, the tempe&s;t, that tries the &s;kill or the fortitude of the pilot: In the fir&s;t, the gai|ety of a &s;un&s;hine &s;cenery cha&s;es away all apprehen&s;ion&mdash;In the la&s;t, the darkened clouds, the rolling thunder, and the for|ked lightening, arre&s;t the &s;en&s;es, and &s;pread a general confu|&s;ion over the mind. Thus, al&s;o, in the humble vale of retire|ment, the &s;cenes that pre&s;ent them&s;elves to view are too u|niform&mdash;the circum&s;tances that occur are too unintere&s;ting to draw forth the full force of a man's character. 'Tis in the rugged and diver&s;ified &s;cenes of trouble&mdash;'Tis in the intere&s;ting and uncommon circum&s;tances of danger, that the &s;oul of man is arou&s;ed&mdash;that his latent faculties are called forth into action&mdash;in fine, that he di&s;covers him&s;elf WHAT HE IS!</P>
<P>It was in a dreary wilderne&s;s&mdash;amid&s;t &s;avage foes&mdash;in the horror and di&s;may of a &s;avage &s;laughter, occa&s;ioned by im|prudent bravery,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The event here alluded was Braddock's defeat.</NOTE> that the &s;uperior genius of our HERO fir&s;t di&s;played it&s;elf with uncommon &s;plendor&mdash;He arre&s;ted the progre&s;s of death&mdash;He reanimated his drooping com|panions, and, like another Xenophon, led his little band &s;afe to Virginia, through a country mo&s;tly inimical, and affording but few, if any nece&s;&s;aries.</P>
<P>Though his fame was now e&s;tabli&s;hed, it had not reached its zenith. He was only advanced one grade in the climax of his greatne&s;s. God, who had thus favourably u&s;hered him into public life, was preparing new laurels to enwreathe his brows. An event &s;oon occurred, embracing every thing &s;ingular in its commencement, difficult in its nature, &s;trik|ing in its developement, and terrible in its con&s;equences, if unfavorably terminated, but glorious if otherwi&s;e, which called forth all the great re&s;ources of WASHINTON, and di&s;played unto us, to his enemies, and to the world at large, his pre-eminently exalted character. This <HI>event,</HI> was that revolution in which we &s;o ju&s;tly glory, and which has laid the foundation of our national independence and con&s;equence. At the fir&s;t dawn of our troubles, he took a deci&s;ive part: It was a part adopted from a conviction of its ju&s;tice, and &s;anctioned by Nature and Nature's God. Need I mention, it was a part again&s;t the ill-timed&mdash;the prepo&s;terous&mdash;the unnatural preten&s;ions of Britain.&mdash;When the troubles were drawing to an awful cri&s;is, and a re&s;ort to arms was unavoida|ble, the eyes of our Rulers, attracted by the glories of a
<PB REF="038421_0006_1011E935D57F18F8">
ri&s;ing &s;un, fa&s;tened upon <HI>the hero of Mount Vernon,</HI> and they unanimou&s;ly called him to head the undi&s;ciplined armies of his country. He accepted the appointment of <HI>Commander in chief,</HI> though with diffidence&mdash;He doubted his abilities, and in tho&s;e doubts, was &s;een that mode&s;ty which ever ac|companies real merit.</P>
<P>Behold him, now in the field, directing the movements of an army, half formed, &s;carcely clothed, and with little or no ammunition&mdash;His ta&s;k was Herculean&mdash;the labour attach|ed to it enormous!! Yet nothing could <HI>deter</HI> him from his undertaking, or intimidate him in the completion of it&mdash;nei|ther the celebrity of Briti&s;h valor, maturated by repeated victories, nor the greatne&s;s of Briti&s;h re&s;ources, increa&s;ed by a &s;eries of pro&s;perity, nor even the imputation of an un|ju&s;t and wanton rebellion, &s;o bitterly painful to a mind con|&s;cious of its integrity. It was ju&s;tice&mdash;the ju&s;tice of an injured people crying for reparation, that <HI>nerved</HI> the arm of WASHINGTON, and in&s;pired his bo&s;om with heroic ar|dor. Feeling its power, and following its impul&s;e, he dared to oppo&s;e the armies of a nation, grown grey with con|que&s;t. His &s;ucce&s;s was a&s;toni&s;hing, and was effected, not &s;o much by bloody battles, as by &s;kill and prudence, in war|ding off dangers when fore&s;een, and &s;eizing advantages when offered. His great de&s;ire was to prevent <HI>an unnece&s;&s;a|ry effu&s;ion of human blood</HI>&mdash;His heart bled for the victims of war, and he has ever been &s;een to drop a tear in the mid&s;t of battle. How unlike tho&s;e heroes, &s;o greatly celebrated in the pages of ancient and modern &s;tory! They have added tenfold to the horrors of war, by their brutality and intem|perance. And tho' they may have made them&s;elves prai&s;|ed while living&mdash;yet their memories are branded with infa|my&mdash;They were, undoubtedly, the de&s;troyers of the human race.&mdash;Not &s;o our WASHINGTON&mdash;He di&s;played, in the late conte&s;t an humanene&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, that forced an univer&s;al tribute of honor and love. The tears of the widow and the orphan, wantonly injured by him, can never have di&s;turbed his repo&s;e: but his reflections, in this particular, mu&s;t have been "plea&s;ant, like the memory of pa&s;t joys."</P>
<P>My countrymen, need I enlarge upon his military a|chievements? Shall I picture to your imagination the battles won by his valor, or the advantages obtained by his &s;kill? In the volume of hi&s;tory they are recorded, and on the ta|bles of our hearts they are engraved. Though he had il|lu&s;trious compeers, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the &s;ublime &s;truggle, and who are entitled to the ju&s;t tribute of enthu&s;ia&s;tic prai&s;e,
<PB N="7" REF="038421_0007_1011E939231B5DA0">
yet, under God, HE was the principal in&s;trument. Like a firm and ma&s;&s;y pillar in a tottering fabric, he &s;upported our precarious and &s;inking nation. Superior to adver&s;ity, his firmne&s;s never for&s;ook him. Even when the pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s was awfully forbidding and gloomy, HE was calm and undi&s;mayed,
<Q><L>"As &s;ome tall cliff that lifts its awful form,</L>
<L>"Swells from the vale, and midway leaves the &s;torm;</L>
<L>"Tho' round its brea&s;t the rolling clouds are &s;pread,</L>
<L>"Eternal &s;un&s;hine &s;ettles on its head."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">GOLDSMITH.</NOTE></L></Q></P>
<P>Other generals would have &s;unk under &s;uch rever&s;es as his country experienced. But WASHINGTON ro&s;e &s;uperior to every misfortune, and thus, when all appeared to be lo&s;t, literally &s;aved our country. Never, never can we forget our forlorn condition, when the poor remnant of our army had fled beyond the Delaware. The tempe&s;t of war was pouring in a main upon us&mdash;our hands hung in de&s;pondence&mdash; gloom &s;at depicted in every face&mdash;de&s;pair reigned in every heart&mdash;our national exi&s;tence was at its la&s;t ga&s;p&mdash;it was &s;truggling in the agonies of an untimely death&mdash;When lo! guided by the God of Battles, WASHINGTON, with the &s;udden and rapid force of a mountain torrent, fell upon the Briti&s;h at Trenton and Princeton, and put them to flight. Like O&s;&s;ian's hero, "he moved like an angry gho&s;t before a cloud, when meteors enclo&s;e him, and the dark winds are in his hands." Victory thus once more perched upon the American &s;tandard, re-animated our ex|piring country, and cau&s;ed her to look forth with all the fond anticipations of hope. Nor was &s;he di&s;appointed; Heaven, in pity for her &s;truggles, which were many and great, in&s;pired a foreign power to &s;end a&s;&s;i&s;tance to our coa&s;ts. The armies and fleets of Louis the XVI &s;econded our efforts with &s;uch energy, as to ha&s;ten an honorable peace. WASHINGTON directed the whole, and, like "a &s;tream of many tides," rolled on in his cour&s;e with maje&s;ty and power, paralyzing every oppo&s;ition. With one hand he upheld a diver&s;ified confederation, and with the other &s;mote the enemies of his country. Thus he progre&s;&s;ed in pro&s;|perity and fame, till the valor of Americans, under his guidance, forcibly wrung from Britain, what ju&s;tice, what honor, what hone&s;ty had not been able to obtain; and the acknowledgement of our independence rewarded our toils, our hard&s;hips, and our &s;ufferings.&mdash;At this time, had WASHINGTON had the lea&s;t &s;park of ambition in his bo&s;om,
<PB N="8" REF="038421_0008_1011E93B131E1E88">
the wind of popular applau&s;e would have blown it into a blaze But no; ambition lurked not in him; he was the true patriot. Not all the enticements of military power, &s;o long enjoyed, or the in&s;inuations of &s;ome fellow-officers, could divert him from his &s;teady purpo&s;e. He had drawn his &s;word for American freedom, and when this was obtain|ed, HE &s;heathed it, magnanimou&s;ly re&s;igning his command, and retiring to his e&s;tate. Here, fellow-citizens, were wi&s;|dom and re&s;olution di&s;played, to which hi&s;tory can afford no &s;econd. The conduct of our chieftain was wi&s;e; for law|le&s;s power has a tendency to corrupt the mind, and &s;trangle fellow-feeling; it affords the means of &s;en&s;uality, and en|genders depraved habits. Had WASHINGTON &s;eized the opportunity which offered, this day would probably have been a day of rejoicing, for a tyrant would have been no more. The conduct of our chieftain was re&s;olute; for the love of power is one of the &s;tronge&s;t pa&s;&s;ions inherent in hu|man nature; it is coeval with the fir&s;t exertions of rea&s;on, and accompanies us through all the &s;tages of &s;ub&s;equent life.</P>
<P>While in retirement, unlike tho&s;e turbulent &s;pirits, who are ever di&s;&s;atisfied unle&s;s they direct public affairs, WASH|INGTON was the quiet, though u&s;efully active citizen. He did not indulge him&s;elf in inglorious ea&s;e, but attended to the pur&s;uits of &s;cience, and the employments of agriculture. Thus, in the peaceful &s;hade of his villa, he enjoyed the re|fined luxury of an "<HI>otium cum dignitate.</HI>"</P>
<P>His retirement, however, was &s;hort. A &s;en&s;e of duty again obliged him to take an active part on the grand theatre of life. The impotence of the old confederation was &s;oon felt, and its imperfections univer&s;ally acknowledged. The &s;erpent of di&s;union was charming us to ruin, and de&s;truction creeping imperceptibly upon our infant nation; when, by a &s;trong, though peaceful effort, we &s;trangled the fir&s;t, and arre&s;ted the progre&s;s of the la&s;t. <HI>A New Con&s;titution,</HI> with|out an armed force to impo&s;e it, was adopted by our coun|try, and WASHINGTON was called, by the unanimous voice of his countrymen, to the re&s;pon&s;ible office of &s;upreme magi&s;trate. The joy expre&s;&s;ed on his acceptance, as you know, Americans, was unbounded. Wherever he came he was received in triumph, and, from every quarter, con|gratulations were &s;ent, breathing nothing but gratitude, love and admiration. The&s;e general applau&s;es, which were be&s;towed upon WASHINGTON, did not inflate him with pride, as it would have done weaker minds. They were, no
<PB REF="038421_0009_1011E93DDB0BC078" MS="y">
doubt, plea&s;ing to his bo&s;om, and had a tendency to &s;timu|late him to new di&s;plays of zeal and attachment to his native and newly emancipated country.</P>
<P>HE now entered on the arduous, the difficult, the im|portant, and, to him, untried duties of a <HI>&s;tate&s;man.</HI>&mdash; He trod a path that had mi&s;led many in its intricate wind|ings, and which, like the fabled Minotaur of old, had proved their ruin. But, like The&s;eus, he e&s;caped unhurt; his Ariadne was <HI>Integrity;</HI> no intrigues &s;tained his politics; no corruption marked his mea&s;ures. That &s;ame love for his country, that &s;ame regard for her welfare, which had here|tofore di&s;covered it&s;elf, &s;till actuated him. His &s;ituation was novel, and called for uncommon prudence. The prin|ciples of republicani&s;m had never prevailed in their purity&mdash; at lea&s;t <HI>no modern example</HI> offered. Of cour&s;e the idea of ra|tional liberty, upon a republican plan, mu&s;t have been im|perfect till our revolution. He had then no model for his conduct but his <HI>own</HI> mind. Be&s;ides this, he pre&s;ided when the old world was horribly convul&s;ed with <HI>war,</HI> and &s;uch a war as was unexampled in the annals of hi&s;tory, for its atro|cities, and its woeful &s;laughter; like a tornado, it whirled through Europe with &s;uch direful violence, as to root up prejudice it&s;elf, and threaten the di&s;&s;olution of &s;ociety.&mdash; Gratitude for a recent and &s;plendid benefit, intere&s;ted Ame|rica on one &s;ide of the contending parties&mdash;Prudence and in|tere&s;t forbade an interference with either. Thus critically &s;ituated, WASHINGTON, by his wi&s;dom and moderation, &s;teered the ve&s;&s;el of which he was pilot, &s;afe through the &s;treight in which it lay, "leaving Scylla on the left, and Charybdis on the right." To &s;ay that he &s;atisfied all his countrymen, wouuld be &s;aying what experience denies.&mdash; The voice of &s;ome, who had a right of thinking, as well as he had a right of acting, arraigned his policy, and doubted his gratitude. The energy of that voice was, however, &s;oon lo&s;t in the remembrance of his pa&s;t &s;ervices. No one could, with any ju&s;tice, attach <HI>improper motives</HI> to him, who, under God, principally e&s;tabli&s;hed our independence, and who had &s;o magnanimou&s;ly re&s;i&s;ted the allurements of ambi|tion, when pre&s;ented. That HE was liable to error, could not be denied. He was a <HI>man,</HI> and, as &s;uch, nece&s;&s;arily imperfect. He never, however, erred upon principle. The defects of his admini&s;tration, when they occurred, proceed|ed not from the <HI>heart,</HI> but the <HI>head.</HI> His heart &s;till beat for his country&mdash;his affections plead all for her intere&s;t.&mdash; His judgment, indeed, was capable of deception, and yet &s;uch was the clearne&s;s of his comprehen&s;ion, that he com|mitted
<PB REF="038421_0010_1011E9424C5030F0" MS="y">
le&s;s mi&s;takes, perhaps, than any &s;tate&s;man that pre|ceded him. Although he ruled over a people jealous of their rights to an extreme, the exceptions to his conduct were, comparatively, &s;mall. His admini&s;tration, as to its general complexion, was <HI>impartial.</HI> He made no pointed invidious di&s;tinctions in the choice of officers. He con&s;i|dered him&s;elf as a public character, and, of cour&s;e, was not &s;wayed by private attachments. Be&s;ides, he knew full well that government was intended for the good of a whole community; and, as &s;uch, that the &s;mile of government ought to extend upon every member of that community. He had yet to learn the incomprehen&s;ible paradox, that <HI>political opinion,</HI> which is as diver&s;ified as human di&s;po&s;itions, con&s;titutes the alone and perfect criterion of merit, of abili|ties, of morality, nay, of <HI>Chri&s;tianity!</HI> He gra&s;ped in his enlarged embrace the whole American nation. They were his brethren, and he felt that he was exalted above them &s;olely for their good. Wealth was not his object&mdash;he only regarded it for the nece&s;&s;aries of life. You all know how he nobly refu&s;ed compen&s;ation for his &s;ervices. His great object, as a &s;tate&s;man, was your happine&s;s&mdash;your pro&s;peri|ty. For this he devoted his time&mdash;his faculties&mdash;his pro|perty &mdash;his life. Deaf to the in&s;inuations of flattery, he was al&s;o regardle&s;s of reproach, when his actions originated in his mature judgment. The breath of popular applau&s;e or popular di&s;like never influenced him to &s;werve from his purpo&s;e. A manly deci&s;ion formed a prominent trait in his character; and yet it was tempered with &s;o much <HI>mode&s;ty,</HI> as even to di&s;arm the violence of party. He never arrogated any importance to him&s;elf, but arre&s;ted the attention, and pointed it to the <HI>&s;ource</HI> of his greatne&s;s. His magnanimity could not &s;toop to that <HI>contemptible littlene&s;s</HI> of &s;oul, which, in the contemplation of &s;econd cau&s;es, forgets the Supreme Fir&s;t Cau&s;e. He rendered tribute where tribute was due, and gratefully acknowledged, that GOD alone had made him great.</P>
<P>Compare HIM with tho&s;e illu&s;trious &s;tate&s;men that pre|ceded him; where will you find &s;o few &s;triking defects, &s;o many uncommon excellencies? We may at lea&s;t a&s;&s;ert, that none of them exceeded, and but few rivalled him. In the &s;y&s;tems of the ancients, we find much rudene&s;s; and in tho&s;e of the moderns, much incon&s;i&s;tency. Both ancient and modern &s;tand attainted with the charge of di&s;hone&s;ty, and both di&s;covered but little &s;en&s;e of their dependant nature.&mdash; An unmanly pride for the mo&s;t part tinctured their cha|racter, which urged them to exalt a worm to the throne of Jehovah, and made the wretched reptile arbiter of his own fate.</P>
<P><PB REF="038421_0011_1011E9455048DA90" MS="y">WASHINGTON, advancing in the vale of years, felt fatigu|ed with the burden of public affairs, and wi&s;hed for ea&s;e in his old days. This however would not have been con&s;ulted, if duty had &s;till required his labors&mdash;for to this he uniformly &s;acrificed private feelings&mdash;But he had fini&s;hed the work which his country had a&s;&s;igned to him. The new gov|ernment was organized, and bid fair for perpetuity&mdash;Pow|er had now no charms for him&mdash;HE returned once more to the bo&s;om of his country, and, like another Cincinnatus, re&s;umed his agricultural employments. This &s;tep, like the re&s;t of his conduct, was exclu&s;ively his own. It di&s;played the man! The more we con&s;ider it, the more admirable and uncommon does his di&s;intere&s;ted patrioti&s;m appear. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of power was here con&s;i&s;tent with duty. He might have again a&s;pired with the greate&s;t ju&s;tice to the fir&s;t office of his country. Our eyes were &s;till fixed upon him, to follow his movements and obey his authority&mdash;But he retired from our view, and &s;ecluded him&s;elf once more in the rece&s;s of his dear villa.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t there, his country was threatened by a foreign na|tion, who once were our friends, but now appeared to a&s;&s;ume a ho&s;tile a&s;pect. A re&s;ort to arms became a matter of expe|diency. WASHINGTON was a third time called forth upon the public &s;tage, and con&s;ented to take the command of our armies. Before a new trial of his valor and prudence occur|red, the Angel of Death &s;ummoned him to the tribunal of his GOD! He de&s;ended to the grave in the full blo&s;&s;om of age, "bearing his blu&s;hing honors thick upon him."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">SHAKESPEARE.</NOTE></P>
<P>In reviewing every circum&s;tance of WASHINGTON's life &mdash;con&s;idering the temptations accompanying popularity like his&mdash;the many trying and novel &s;cenes in which he was pla|ced, and then recollecting <HI>his uniform patrioti&s;m&mdash;his undevi|ating integrity&mdash;his un&s;haken fortitude&mdash;his humane bravery&mdash; his uncommon mode&s;ty&mdash;and, above all, the brilliant &s;ucce&s;s</HI> which attended him thro' life, we may boldly a&s;&s;ert, that the world has never &s;een one &s;uperior to the Hero of Mount Vernon. Others, indeed, have been &s;plendidly great, but none, like him, connected moral goodne&s;s, in &s;o great a degree, with his greatne&s;s. The beauties of his character are &s;o many, and &s;o intere&s;ting, as to ca&s;t the mantle of forgetfulne&s;s over his blemi&s;hes. "Illu&s;trious man! to who&s;e tomb po&s;terity &s;hall come and &s;ay, as Pericles did over the bodies of his decea&s;|ed fellow &s;oldiers, you are like to the divinites above us&mdash; You are no longer with us&mdash;You are known only by the be|nefits which you have conferred."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">FLOOD&mdash;THE IRISH ORATOR.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB REF="038421_0012_1011E9482F29AB60" MS="y">Such was WASHINGTON, who&s;e lo&s;s we this day mourn. How &s;trange and &s;ad the rever&s;e which a year has produced! On this day, ere now, the &s;ound of joy re echoed through our land. It was the birth day of our Illu&s;trious Favorite. But now&mdash;Righteous GOD! how &s;olemn and in&s;tructive thy le&s;&s;ons!!&mdash;now HE is gone to "that land, from who&s;e bourne no traveller returns"&mdash;and in&s;tead of commemorating his birth, we lament his death!.... Ideas the mo&s;t mourn|ful ru&s;h to our minds, and force open the flood gates of grief. He is gone from us forever. Our eyes &s;hall no more &s;ee him till on that day, "when the Angel of the Lord, &s;tanding with his one foot on the &s;ea, and the other on the land, &s;hall lift up his hand to heaven, and &s;wear by HIM that liveth forever and ever, that time &s;hall be no more!.....</P>
<P>But, Americans, although dead, his example &s;till re|mains, and affords us emphatic le&s;&s;ons, worthy of our re|verence and obedience.</P>
<P>To you, &s;oldiers, its language is, "un&s;heathe not your &s;words for the purpo&s;e of &s;hedding blood, except it be for &s;elf-defence, or in defence of your country, and its rights&mdash; and, in the latter ca&s;e, keep them un&s;heathed, and prefer falling with them in your hands, to their relinqui&s;hment."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">WASHINGTON'S WILL.</NOTE> In your warfare remember you are men, and add not to the mi&s;eries of war. Avoid ra&s;hne&s;s, and fal&s;e courage. Be temperately brave, intrepid and prudent. Bear up again&s;t rever&s;es of fortune, and re&s;t your hopes on the God of Battles.</P>
<P>To you, Free and Accepted Ma&s;ons, the example of WASHINGTON enforces the practice of tho&s;e virtues, which con&s;titute the extetnal objects of your in&s;titution. Let your love be without di&s;&s;imulation, and your charity not to be &s;een of the world, but to di&s;&s;ipate human woe. Con|nect love to God and the precepts of Chri&s;tianity, with love to the Brethren and the precepts of morality. Study to &s;hew your&s;elves workmen that need not be a&s;hamed, right|ly performing your &s;everal duties.</P>
<P>To us, fellow-citizens, the example of WASHINGTON recommends reverence for religion, obedience to the laws, and the cultivation of &s;ocial love. Be upright, di&s;intere&s;t|ed and virtuous&mdash;avoid di&s;&s;entions&mdash;annihilate the infernal &s;pirit of party, and let harmony reign throughout our land.</P>
<P>But his example, Americans, does not only in&s;truct us. From his tomb a voice proceeds, impre&s;&s;ive and awful, and &s;peaks to you&mdash;to me&mdash;to us all, with energy, "PREPARE TO DIE, AND MEET YOUR GOD!"</P>
