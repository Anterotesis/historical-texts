<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>HAVING frequently had to wit|ne&s;s the accidents attendant upon mi&s;|management, in the practice of Mid|wifery, and having, with pain, re|flected upon the limited knowledge of that bu&s;ine&s;s among mo&s;t of the fe|male practitioners, I have, for a con|&s;iderable time pa&s;t, had a wi&s;h, that &s;ome means might be adopted for the better information of tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ary, though too much neglected, members of the community.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I con&s;ider midwives as nece&s;&s;ary, and, not only nece&s;&s;ary, but indi&s;pen|&s;ably

&s;o, notwith&s;tanding the abun|dance of phy&s;icians, becau&s;e &s;ome wo|men, ab&s;olutely refu&s;e having a man to attend them in their labours, or at lea&s;t not till they are convinced of be|ing in a critical or dangerous &s;ituation, and oftentimes not until they are be|yond the reach of the greate&s;t &s;kill. However indi&s;creet and ill-&s;ounded this prejudice may be con&s;idered, let it be called whim, a fal&s;e delicacy or what we will, it matters nought to me, exi&s;ting di&s;tre&s;s, whether it ari&s;es from rea&s;on or folly, equally demands our attention; and if we cannot af|ford relief by one method, it behoves us to attempt it by another. If wo|men cannot be per&s;uaded to &s;ubmit them&s;elves to the care of male prac|titioners, it is our duty to in&s;truct fe|males how to give them the nece&s;&s;ary aid. That this prejudice does exi&s;t, and that &s;ome women will have none but their own &s;ex to a&s;&s;i&s;t them upon &s;uch
<PB N="v" REF="038477_0005_101215143A728E10">
occa&s;ions, every day's experience teaches us: and that this di&s;po&s;ition is firm and not to be overcome, the arbitrary decrees of the government of Athens clearly demon&s;trate; for while with them midwives were prohibited from practi&s;ing, the fatal &s;ufferings of many of their women, fully proved the futility of attempting to confine that bu&s;ine&s;s entirely in the hands of the men.</HI></P>
<P><HI>However &s;ufficient in it&s;elf this rea&s;on may be, it is by no means the only or the greate&s;t one for encou|raging the &s;tudy of Midwifery with women: for even were there no ob|jections in the mind of any to the em|ployment of male practitioners, &s;till the nature of the practice of phy&s;ic, in this country, is &s;uch, that phy&s;ici|ans cannot afford to give up &s;o much of their time from their other bu&s;i|ne&s;s, as would be nece&s;&s;arily employed
<PB N="vi" REF="038477_0006_10121515C742DF18">
upon &s;uch occa&s;ions, for the &s;mall compen&s;ation, that the greater pro|portion of citizens are able, without di&s;tre&s;&s;ing their families, to make them. What then mu&s;t be done? The only means to relieve the major part of the community, both from op|pre&s;&s;ion and from danger, in &s;uch ca&s;es, is the judicious e&s;tabli&s;hment of regularly in&s;tructed midwives.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Be&s;ides the&s;e rea&s;ons, which are of a general application, there is an ad|ditional one for their e&s;tabli&s;hment in the country. In cities a phy&s;ician often may, in lingering ca&s;es, &s;teal time enough from them to vi&s;it his other patients; but, in more thinly &s;ettled places, the nece&s;&s;ary di&s;tance of their patients is &s;uch, as to render it impo&s;&s;ible for a phy&s;ician to practi&s;e midwifery with prudence, and to do ju&s;tice to his other practice: in this re&s;pect, then, the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of mid|wives
<PB N="vii" REF="038477_0007_1012151A631C8E50">
is not merely convenient, but indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary.</HI></P>
<P><HI>So forcibly has the propriety of in|&s;tructing females in the art of mid|wifery, impre&s;&s;ed the liberal minded in Europe, that their mo&s;t celebrated phy&s;icians have not failed to expre&s;s an "ardent wi&s;h that &s;chools might be erected in their principal cities for that purpo&s;e." And the committee, in their propo&s;als for regulating and im|proving the practice of Medicine in France, have carefully recommended mea&s;ures to that effect: con&s;idering it as an object de&s;erving their particu|lar attention.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Whatever may have been the de|&s;ire, and whatever may have been done el&s;ewhere, no plan of the kind, as far as I can learn, has heretofore been e&s;tabli&s;hed in America: con&s;e|quently the midwives, with a very
<PB N="viii" REF="038477_0008_10121522D86A1770">
few exceptions, are as ignorant of their bu&s;ine&s;s as the women they deli|ver: and I much doubt whether one out of twenty of them have ever &s;een the bones that &s;upport and protect the womb: indeed I cannot but &s;u&s;pect whether &s;ome even know, that, in be|ing born, a child has to pa&s;s through a bony pa&s;&s;age. The greater part of them, at lea&s;t as far as my enquiries have reached, having taken up the bu&s;ine&s;s by accident, having fir&s;t been catched, as they expre&s;s it, with a woman in labour, they were forced to receive the child. Attendant &s;uc|ce&s;s in&s;piring confidence, they without more ado, con&s;ider them&s;elves compe|tent, and become immediately e&s;tabli&s;h|ed in the profe&s;&s;ion. But the more diffident and con&s;iderate, tho&s;e who &s;eek further information, have not ge|nerally been much better off: Books were their only helps, and books, of them&s;elves, are but dim lights indeed;
<PB N="ix" REF="038477_0009_10121524710CC340">
generally rendered &s;till more gloomy by the cloud of technical ob&s;curity in which they are involved. To learn &s;uch a handicraft bu&s;ine&s;s by reading alone, is like learning &s;hip-building without touching timber. Can we expect, but that &s;uch workers, in ei|ther occupation, mu&s;t de&s;troy more ma|terials than their good work will ever pay for?</HI></P>
<P><HI>How, it may be a&s;ked, in the pri|mitive times, did they do? We have no account of ob&s;tetrical &s;chools, nor hear any complaint of ignorant mid|wives; children were born then as well as now; why may not women, without &s;o much &s;tudy and in&s;truction, attend one another as well now as then? or, is child-birth a di&s;order, that women mu&s;t always have a &s;kil|ful per&s;on to a&s;&s;i&s;t them? Probably in the early ages, before the pamper|ing &s;tews of luxury had taken the
<PB N="x" REF="038477_0010_10121525F7F37C80">
place of the &s;alutary calls of nature in diet, and before the warping tram|mels of fa&s;hion had taken the lead of comfort and convenience in dre&s;s, &s;el|dom, very &s;eldom, was there any di&s;|ea&s;e in child-bearing, or difficulty in travail. Delivery is certainly a na|tural proce&s;s, and &s;o far am I from con&s;idering a&s;&s;i&s;tance as always nece&s;|&s;ary, that I doubt whether the whole art of midwifery will ever compen|&s;ate for the mi&s;chief ari&s;ing from the officious interference of ignorance in its practice.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Under the impre&s;&s;ion of the forego|ing con&s;iderations, in the fore part of the la&s;t winter, I propo&s;ed to the fe|male practitioners in this city, and &s;uch other women as wi&s;hed informa|tion in the art of midwifery, to deli|ver them a cour&s;e of in&s;truction in that bu&s;ine&s;s, connected with the pri|vilege of their attending the practice
<PB N="xi" REF="038477_0011_1012152960C41B78">
of the lying-in ward in the Alms-Hou&s;e. And altho' it mu&s;t be regret|ted that a great proportion of them, either from an idea of &s;elf-&s;ufficiency, from not duly appreciating the import|ance of their profe&s;&s;ion, from indo|lence, or, po&s;&s;ibly, from a dread of the retro&s;pect, that opening their eyes might pre&s;ent to their &s;en&s;es, &s;till cho&s;e to grope on in their original darkne&s;s. Yet, to their credit be it &s;aid, a num|ber, and tho&s;e al&s;o who appeared to be among the mo&s;t con&s;iderate and better informed, embraced the propo&s;ition with alacrity, and have &s;ince attended to the e&s;tabli&s;hment with a punctuality and attention, worthy the high object of their pur&s;uit.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The following &s;heets, be&s;ides a &s;hort &s;yllabus of the lectures, contains the &s;ub&s;tance of the three concluding ones, being a &s;hort recapitulation of the parts mo&s;t material to midwives; with

directions and cautions re&s;pecting their conduct in the practice of their pro|fe&s;&s;ion; publi&s;hed by the particular reque&s;t of the cla&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The author has con&s;ented to their publication, not from a preten&s;ion of the new light that they may throw up|on the art of widwifery, but with the hope of their &s;erving as a medium through which, as far as they go, to tran&s;mit its pre&s;ent perfection to the attention of tho&s;e to whom they are directed: &s;hould be thereby promote a more general &s;pirit of enquiry among the female practiti|oners, his purpo&s;es will be fully an|&s;wered; &s;hould he not, he re&s;ts upon his intentions as a &s;ecurity from cen&s;ure.</HI></P>

<HEAD>RECAPITULATION.</HEAD>
<P>IN the cour&s;e of in&s;truction, that we are now about clo&s;ing, I have endeavoured, in the mo&s;t &s;imple manner, to make the <HI>art of Midwifery,</HI> which, unfortunate|ly,
<PB N="42" REF="038477_0042_1012159CC1526CB8">
like the other branches of our profe&s;&s;ion, has till of late been too much cloaked by the my&s;tic rub|bi&s;h of technical phra&s;eology, fa|miliar to your comprehen&s;ions. I mu&s;t now further beg your atten|tion to a &s;hort <HI>recapitulation</HI> of the &s;ubject, wherein the mo&s;t e&s;&s;en|tial parts will be particularly at|tended to, accompanied with &s;uch <HI>cautions</HI> as in my opinion &s;hould be attended to by every Midwife who would wi&s;h to practi&s;e with &s;afety and &s;atisfaction to their pa|tients, or reputation to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The four fir&s;t Le&s;&s;ons, as you may recollect, and will find by adverting to the Syllabus, were chiefly confined to ob&s;ervations on the &s;y&s;tem at large, and the animal economy in general; and this &s;ubject, I again repeat it, you cannot too much attend to, as no
<PB N="43" REF="038477_0043_101215A34B7113C0">
workman can be too well acquaint|ed with the machine whereon and wherewith he operates. Then we attended to the <HI>peculiarities</HI> of the female &s;y&s;tem, of whom in gene|ral we ob&s;erved that they were of a &s;maller &s;ize, and more delicate and &s;en&s;ible habit than men. Af|ter which we noticed the <HI>particular</HI> peculiarities of the &s;ex, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> their brea&s;ts and uterine &s;y&s;tem, con|&s;i&s;ting of the womb and its ap|pendages.</P>
<P>The <HI>Brea&s;ts</HI> were ob&s;erved to be large globular bodies of glands, intermingled with fat; formed of a great number of blood-ve&s;&s;els, which &s;end off many little tubes to carry the milk that is &s;trained into them; the&s;e uniting as they pa&s;s along, at length end in &s;ix or eight tubes, which, by an irregu|lar, convoluted cour&s;e, finally ter|minate
<PB N="44" REF="038477_0044_101215A6549B2968">
in about as many openings on the point of the nipple. The nipple is of a &s;pungy nature, &s;ub|ject to be di&s;tended or relaxed, &s;ometimes prominent and pointed, at other times flattened and even dented inwards. It is covered only by a thin &s;kin, and is fur|ni&s;hed with numerous little glands, which &s;ecrete an oily glutinous matter to defend it from being fretted by the child's &s;ucking, and al&s;o to clo&s;e up the mouths of the milk ducks, thus aiding their crim|pled form, in preventing the milk from con&s;tantly draining off.</P>
<P>In regard to the &s;y&s;tem of the womb, in the fir&s;t place we ob|&s;erved of the <HI>bones,</HI> upon which the body re&s;ts, and which form its lower part, and con&s;titute what is called the <HI>pelvis</HI> or <HI>ba&s;on,</HI> were compo&s;ed of the <HI>namele&s;s bones,</HI> the
<PB N="45" REF="038477_0045_101215A4CE7460E0">
<HI>&s;acred bone,</HI> and the <HI>rump bone.</HI> The namele&s;s bones were again &s;ubdivided into the <HI>wings</HI> or <HI>haunch, &s;eat</HI> or <HI>hip,</HI> and <HI>fore part</HI> or <HI>&s;hare bones,</HI> the fore part of which la&s;t are joined together by an intervening gri&s;tly &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;acred bone</HI> forms the back part of this compages of bones, and &s;eems to be a continuation of the back bone. It is of an irre|gular triangular &s;hape, with its point downwards, hollowed, and comparatively &s;mooth on its inner &s;urface, but rough and rounding on its out&s;ide. Upon its upper part the back bone re&s;ts, and from its point is continued the little mov|able rump bone.</P>
<P>The &s;acred bone joined to the hinder edge of the namele&s;s bones, forms the ba&s;on, a ju&s;t knowledge
<PB N="46" REF="038477_0046_101215ABF17E41F0">
of which we e&s;teemed as highly intere&s;ting to every one concerned in the practice of Midwifery. The ridge at the upper broad part of the &s;acred bone, where it joins the namele&s;s bones, is met by a ridge at the ba&s;e of the wings or flaring parts of the haunch bones, this ridge is continued to the an|terior part or junction of the &s;hare bones, where they meet and form a regular oval margin called the brim of the ba&s;on. The longe&s;t diameter of this oval brim is from &s;ide to &s;ide, the &s;horte&s;t from fore to back part, the former being about five inches and a quarter, the latter an inch le&s;s. The bones below this ridge all combine in forming the hollow cavity in which the womb and its appenda|ges, the bladder and lower end of the inte&s;tines, are lodged. This is called the ba&s;on. Ob&s;ervation of
<PB N="47" REF="038477_0047_101215AEE79F3810">
the dry bones gives but a very in|adequate idea of the regularity of this cavity, but when we &s;ee the ligaments &s;tretched from the ex|tremities and corners of the &s;acred and rump bones to the &s;eat bones, and its whole inner &s;urface lined by its proper membrane, we can|not but admire its &s;moothne&s;s and regularity, &s;o well adapted to the important purpo&s;es it is intended to an&s;wer. This one circum&s;tance of it is highly worthy of our at|tention, that, as was ju&s;t ob&s;erved, the longe&s;t diameter of this cavity at its brim was from &s;ide to &s;ide, and the &s;horte&s;t from fore to hind part; in the lower aperture we find the&s;e proportions rever&s;ed, here the longe&s;t diameter being from fore to hind part, and the &s;horte&s;t from &s;ide to &s;ide, or from &s;eat bone to &s;eat bone.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="038477_0048_101215B687033250">
Of the ba&s;on it was further ob|&s;erved, that its depth was al&s;o ir|regular, being about &s;ix inches behind, four at the &s;ides, and two at its anterior part.</P>
<P>Having fixed the &s;ize of the ba&s;on, as it mo&s;t generally exi&s;ts in females, &s;ubject however to &s;ome little variation; we proceeded to examine the &s;ize and &s;hape of the child's head and &s;houlders, and found the greate&s;t diameter to be from the hind to the fore|head, the &s;horte&s;t from &s;ide to &s;ide, while the greate&s;t diameter of the body was acro&s;s the &s;houlders. Hence, then, we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, what indeed happens in natural labours, that the child's head, at its fir&s;t pre&s;entation, would lie with its forehead and hind head to the haunch bones, while the ears lie to the &s;acred and &s;hare bones.

But as the labour advances, the head, favouring the pa&s;&s;age it has to pa&s;s through, naturally turns &s;o, that, as it gets to the inferior opening of the bones, its forehead is &s;unk into the hollow of the &s;a|cred bone, while its hind head is pre&s;ented to the junction of the &s;hare bones. And further, as the depth of the ba&s;on is by far the lea&s;t at its anterior part, the hind head naturally ri&s;es from under the&s;e bones as it comes into the world. By the time the head is born, the &s;houlders being the wid|e&s;t part of the body, are fixed acro&s;s the longe&s;t diameter of the ba&s;on, till a &s;ucceeding pain pro|pelling it forward, it takes the turn and the child is born on its &s;ide.</P>

of labour? And concluded that, from their firm adhe&s;ion to each other by their cementing gri&s;tle, rendered doubly &s;trong by the &s;urrounding ligaments, the whole power of the womb, with the aid of the mu&s;cles of the belly, did not appear adequate to that effect; and that if we &s;hould admit that they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;trength &s;ufficient, the child's head was &s;o compo&s;ed, of various unconnected bones, as by no means to be able to over|come the powerful re&s;i&s;tance that their firm connexion would make; we might almo&s;t as well conceive of a knurly log's being &s;plit by a wedge of cork:&mdash;We finally con|cluded that, except in ca&s;es of di&s;|ea&s;e, none of the bones of the ba|&s;on had any motion upon one another, during labour, excepting the rump bone, which is generally &s;traightened out, nearly upon a

line with the back, by the pre&s;&s;ure of the child's head.</P>
<P>The bones of the ba&s;on we mentioned were &s;ometimes de|formed and crooked, dimini&s;hing in &s;ome way or other the natural &s;ize of this cavity; we ob&s;erved that this happened by the upper part of the &s;acred bone being pre&s;|&s;ed inwards, thereby le&s;&s;ening the &s;horte&s;t diameter of the brim of the ba&s;on; but that in &s;ome in|&s;tances the fault laid in the &s;hare bones being pre&s;&s;ed inwards, in other ca&s;es in the &s;eat bones or lower part of the &s;acred bone be|ing projected upwards and in|wards. The&s;e deformities were &s;aid <HI>&s;ometimes</HI> to be owing to rheu|matic affections, and that even in women who may have previou&s;ly borne children through a capaci|ous ba&s;on; but that <HI>generally</HI> the
<PB N="52" REF="038477_0052_101215C269E94B38">
cau&s;e of them were laid in early years, and was owing to rickety complaints: the bones thereby be|coming &s;oftened, there appeared no difficulty in accounting for the variety of crookedne&s;s, from the various pre&s;&s;ure of the &s;uperin|cumbent body upon them in the &s;tates of &s;tanding, of &s;itting, and of lying. It was further remark|ed that this deformity was often accompanied by like affections in the other bones, &s;o that when, with a curved back bone, the legs and thighs were al&s;o crooked, there was great rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect this complaint; and if delivery &s;hould go on laboriou&s;ly, it &s;hould be par|ticularly attended to.</P>
<P>After having fully attended to the bones of the ba&s;on, both in their &s;eparate and in their con|nected &s;tate, and after having
<PB N="53" REF="038477_0053_101215C503BB23A0">
viewed the difference between the aperture of a natural and of a de|formed ba&s;on, and ob&s;erved the great difficulty that con&s;equently mu&s;t take place in labour from that circum&s;tance, we proceeded to examine the <HI>parts</HI> of <HI>generation</HI> in women, which, to be enabled more perfectly to de&s;cribe, we di|vided into <HI>external</HI> and <HI>internal</HI> parts.</P>
<P>The EXTERNAL PARTS were di&s;coverable without the aid of di&s;&s;ection, and con&s;i&s;ted of the <HI>mons veneris,</HI> which is a fatty &s;ub&s;tance lying upon the junction of the &s;hare bones covered with the com|mon integuments, &s;kin, &amp;c. Con|tinued down from this on each &s;ide were the <HI>labiae pudendi,</HI> form|ed of fat covered by a doubling of the &s;kin, which externally were like the &s;urface of the <HI>mons,</HI> but
<PB N="54" REF="038477_0054_101215C8E111F910">
internally were &s;mooth and red; the&s;e joining together again be|low, entirely &s;urrounded the en|trance of the pa&s;&s;age to the womb.</P>
<P>Between the two labiae pudendi, about an inch below their &s;epara|tion at the mons, is &s;ituated the <HI>Clitoris,</HI> which re&s;embles, in &s;ome degree, the end of a finger; it is &s;aid to have been very much en|larged in &s;ome in&s;tances, whence originated the idea of hermaphro|dites. From this, on each &s;ide, are continued down, doublings of the &s;kin which are called the <HI>Nymphae;</HI> they lie in the direction of the la|biae, and are generally concealed by them, though &s;ometimes they are very inconveniently elongated; they &s;erve to direct the cour&s;e of the urine, and to favour the dila|tation of the&s;e parts in time of delivery.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="038477_0055_101215CDC67BD9E0">
A little below the clitoris, and between the nymphae, we ob&s;erved a &s;mall projecting opening evident to the touch, which is the <HI>orifice</HI> of <HI>the Urethra,</HI> or termination of the canal which leads the urine from the bladder.</P>
<P>The <HI>orifice</HI> of <HI>the vagina,</HI> or the opening of the pa&s;&s;age to the womb, is &s;ituated immediately be|low the orifice of the urethra; this opening in girls is &s;urrounded and nearly clo&s;ed by a membrane cal|led the <HI>Hymen,</HI> which in &s;ome in&s;tances has been found entirely to clo&s;e the pa&s;&s;age, and to pro|duce complete ob&s;truction to the di&s;charge of the men&s;es.</P>
<P>The part which lies between the junction of the labiae pudendi be|low, and the opening of the bow|els, is called <HI>Perinaeum,</HI> which
<PB N="56" REF="038477_0056_101215CF4A42A9C8">
is naturally &s;mall, but is greatly &s;tretched and enlarged during de|livery. To prevent this being torn, we ob&s;erved, was the chief aid ne|ce&s;&s;ary in a natural labour.</P>
<P>Of the INTERNAL PARTS, we fir&s;t noticed the <HI>Vagina</HI> or pa&s;&s;age to the womb, leading from its opening ju&s;t de&s;cribed, about &s;ix or &s;even inches up to the womb; it is of a mu&s;cular nature, capa|ble of great dilatation in time of labour, and of contracting again after delivery; this, as well as the inner &s;urfaces of all the other parts ju&s;t de&s;cribed, is furni&s;hed with little glands for excreting a mucus &s;ub&s;tance for lubricating them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Womb</HI> re&s;embles a bell-pear, but is flattened; it is &s;ituated be|tween the bladder of urine and the
<PB N="57" REF="038477_0057_101215D0CC6E28D0">
lower part of the inte&s;tines. It is &s;upported and joined to the &s;ides of the ba&s;on by two <HI>broad</HI> and two <HI>round ligaments;</HI> in the doublings of the former the blood-ve&s;&s;els and nerves run; the round ligaments al&s;o run in the duplicature of the broad ones, and pa&s;s over the brim of the ba&s;on, to be in&s;erted into the groin.</P>
<P>The womb we divided into <HI>ori|fice, neck,</HI> and <HI>body.</HI> Its <HI>orifice,</HI> we ob&s;erved, hung in the vagina look|ing rather towards its back part: <HI>neck</HI> half the length of the womb. Around the neck the vagina is at|tached, but much nearer its orifice on its fore than on its back part, giving ri&s;e to its po&s;ition as ju&s;t mentioned. The cavity of the neck of the womb is very &s;mall at both ends; it is furni&s;hed with glands for excreting a matter to
<PB N="58" REF="038477_0058_101215D60FD74858">
clo&s;e the womb immediately after conception.</P>
<P>The <HI>body</HI> of the womb is &s;ome|what triangular; its cavity is hard|ly as large as to contain an almond; its inner &s;urface, to the eye, ap|pears perfectly &s;mooth, with no ob&s;ervable opening of the ve&s;&s;els that di&s;charge the periodical eva|cuation. The blood-ve&s;&s;els of the womb greatly enlarge after im|pregnation, &s;o that at their open|ings, where the Placenta or cake adheres, they equal the &s;ize of a quill.</P>
<P>The &s;ub&s;tance of the womb we found to be of a firm, compact nature; formed, as we ob&s;erved, of mu&s;cular fibres running in every direction, of blood-ve&s;&s;els, nerves and lymphatics.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="038477_0059_101215DA46180B18">
From the upper corners of the womb ari&s;e the <HI>Fallopian tubes,</HI> which are continued, in the dou|ble and along the upper part of the flat ligaments for about three inches, when they terminate in ragged ends, which hang loo&s;e in the cavity of the belly. The ca|vities of the&s;e tubes are &s;omewhat trumpet-&s;haped, being very &s;mall at their origin in the womb, but enlarge con&s;iderably towards their termination.</P>
<P>About an inch from the womb, on each &s;ide, a little below and be|hind the fallopian tubes, are two &s;mall, flati&s;h, oval bodies called <HI>ovariae.</HI> They are al&s;o &s;u&s;pended in the broad ligaments.</P>
<P>Having particularly examined and de&s;cribed the&s;e parts, we af|terwards attended to the <HI>Di&s;ea&s;es</HI>

to which they were &s;ubject, but as it always will be mo&s;t prudent to refer the&s;e things to the atten|tion of a phy&s;ician, it may not, perhaps, be any way profitable now, to repeat any thing then &s;aid, in regard either to their &s;ymptoms, cau&s;es or cure.</P>
<P>It was ob&s;erved to you, that every healthy woman, who was not pregnant and did not &s;uckle, had a regular di&s;charge from her womb, called, from the term of its period, <HI>Men&s;es,</HI> from the latin word &s;ignifying month. This di&s;|charge makes its fir&s;t appearance at different ages in different coun|tries; for, like their fruits, it ap|pears early in proportion to the heat of their climates: thus in &s;outhern latitudes it often appears as early as the eighth or ninth year, whereas in the northern ones
<PB N="61" REF="038477_0061_101215E2F5EA71C8">
it is deferred to a much later pe|riod: with us it generally appears between the thirteenth and eight|eenth years. Not only the time of its fir&s;t appearance is affected by the climate, but the frequency of its return, the quantity di&s;|charged, and the time of its final ce&s;&s;ation, are al&s;o all influenced thereby, it being more frequent, more profu&s;e, and &s;ooner cea&s;ing in proportion to the warmth of the country: with us the di&s;charge is, generally, about &s;ix ounces, con|tinues from three to &s;ix days, re|turns monthly, and finally cea&s;es between the forty-fifth and fiftieth year.</P>
<P>The <HI>u&s;e</HI> of this di&s;charge ap|pears to be for keeping the womb in a proper &s;tate for conception, &s;ince that cannot take place either before its appearance, during its
<PB N="62" REF="038477_0062_101215E60A005D20">
ob&s;truction, nor after its ce&s;&s;ation. Another u&s;e is to afford by its &s;u&s;|pen&s;ion, during pregnancy, a ne|ce&s;&s;ary &s;upply of nouri&s;hment for the child.</P>
<P>The <HI>Di&s;ea&s;es</HI> attending their ir|regularity, as well as tho&s;e occur|ing at the time of their final ce&s;&s;a|tion, I &s;hall wave the re-con&s;idera|tion of here; for notwith&s;tanding the particular attention we paid to that &s;ubject, &s;till I would never advi&s;e you to venture to pre&s;cribe for them, when a phy&s;ician can be procured.</P>

<HEAD>OF CONCEPTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE peculiar manner in which conception takes place, being a matter more of curio&s;ity than of real utility, we &s;hall omit at pre|&s;ent any attempt to inve&s;tigate:
<PB N="63" REF="038477_0063_101215E8E60B8468">
thus far, however, it may not be improper to remark, that the child receives &s;ome e&s;&s;ential original principles from both parents; el&s;e why &s;hould it in &s;ome in&s;tances bear &s;o &s;trong a re&s;emblance to the father, and in others to the mo|ther? And that the woman by no means &s;tands in that &s;econdary order, in this wonderful tran&s;ac|tion, as &s;he is &s;tated to do by &s;ome; for did &s;he <HI>only</HI> furni&s;h a &s;afe <HI>re|ceptacle</HI> for the protection, and proper <HI>nouri&s;hment</HI> for the growth of the child, why &s;hould it car|ry the traits of her features in its countenance, or the colour of her &s;kin upon its &s;urface? Might we not as well expect horns to &s;prout out on the forehead of an infant that has been brought up upon the milk of a cow, or a woolly &s;kin upon him who had always been wrapped in flannel?</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="038477_0064_101215EF9BECD1A8">
In whatever way conception is performed, anatomy a&s;&s;ures us, That it <HI>fir&s;t</HI> takes place in the ova|ria, from whence it is taken up by the loo&s;e open ends of the fallopi|an tubes, and conveyed through them to the womb. That it takes this route is proved, fir&s;t, by conception never being effected after the ovariae have been taken out, as has frequently been done by farmers on &s;ome of their ani|mals: &s;econdly, by certain marks di&s;coverable in the&s;e bodies corre|&s;ponding to the number of con|ceptions the per&s;on has had; and la&s;tly, by the rudiments of chil|dren having actually been found enclo&s;ed in them, which, from &s;ome ob&s;truction, had never got into their proper place. That from the ovariae it pa&s;&s;es into the open end of the fallopian tubes, and thence conveyed into the womb,
<PB N="65" REF="038477_0065_101215F14E390D60">
we conclude, fir&s;tly, from not hav|ing di&s;covered any other commu|nication between them; &s;econdly, from children having been found in the tube it&s;elf, which never had reached their de&s;tined place; and, finally, from children having been found in the cavity of the belly, which mu&s;t have been dropped between the ovariae and the mouths of the tubes. Generally the con|ception pa&s;&s;es into and adheres to a part of the womb, where it is nouri&s;hed and grows, &s;o as in about ten weeks to be as large as a hen's egg. Within the cavity of this &s;ub&s;tance, the child is di&s;covera|ble, &s;u&s;pended in water by a &s;mall thread in&s;erted into its navel.</P>
<P>As the conception enlarges, the part adhering particularly to the womb becomes of a &s;pongy na|ture, &s;eemingly well calculated to
<PB N="66" REF="038477_0066_101215F2D251AE98">
draw blood from it. This <HI>cake (placenta)</HI> becomes, at full time, from &s;ix to eight inches in diame|ter, compo&s;ed of a great number of blood-ve&s;&s;els; the&s;e uniting to|gether on one &s;ide, form the navel &s;tring, which is in fact nothing but three blood ve&s;&s;els twi&s;ted to|gether, &s;erving to convey nouri&s;h|ment to the child, and to keep up a circulation between it and the mother.</P>
<P>With the growth of the child, the womb al&s;o enlarges; the <HI>mem|branes</HI> containing the waters, &s;tretch more and more; the <HI>waters</HI> them&s;elves accumulating, protect the child from injuries, favor its regular growth and formation, at the &s;ame time that they guard the mother from the pain its move|ments would otherwi&s;e occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="038477_0067_101215FA331D01B8">
The <HI>child</HI> thus confined in the womb, differs in &s;everal re&s;pects from children &s;omewhat advanced in age, but in none more particu|larly than in the <HI>circulation of their blood,</HI> the <HI>&s;tate of the lungs,</HI> and <HI>&s;tructure of the head.</HI></P>
<P>In per&s;ons who have breathed, the whole ma&s;s of blood pa&s;&s;es regularly through the lungs and then through the body, but in an unborn child, the heart and blood ve&s;&s;els are &s;o modified, as not to &s;end more blood to the lungs than is ju&s;t &s;ufficient for their nouri&s;h|ment: hence they are much firm|er than the lungs of tho&s;e who have once breathed, and will ge|nerally &s;ink in water: after birth, the lungs being expanded by re&s;|piration, the blood is freely tran&s;|mitted through them, and all the&s;e peculiarities of the circulation are
<PB N="68" REF="038477_0068_101215FDA38959E0">
&s;oon obliterated, with a ce&s;&s;ation of the pa&s;&s;age of the blood, through the navel &s;tring.</P>
<P>The bones of the <HI>head</HI> not be|ing joined together, and indeed not being fully formed, admit of a degree of motion, and are fre|quently lapped over each other, and moulded in a &s;urpri&s;ing man|ner in laborious deliveries.</P>
<P>As the <HI>womb</HI> increa&s;es during the time of pregnancy, it fir&s;t en|larges at its body, and, from its increa&s;ed weight, &s;inks down into the cavity of the ba&s;on: hence, if a woman is examined during this period, the mouth of the womb will be di&s;covered lower than na|tural, and will feel heavier to the touch: at or about the third month, the womb becoming too large to be confined within the
<PB N="69" REF="038477_0069_10121600956591D0">
cavity of the ba&s;on, ri&s;es up above its brim, and then its orifice being higher is more difficultly felt: this difficulty increa&s;es as the woman advances till labour comes on. During this enlargement of the womb, its neck becomes entirely obliterated, it being all &s;tretched out into the general di&s;tention. A remarkable circum&s;tance of the womb is, that notwith&s;tanding its great di&s;tention, it &s;uffers no di|minution in its thickne&s;s, it being no thinner at the time of delivery than before impregnation: this is owing to its becoming much more &s;pongy, by the general enlarge|ment of its ve&s;&s;els. The &s;udden contraction of the womb makes its &s;ides con&s;iderably thicker &s;oon after delivery, the ve&s;&s;els not hav|ing yet returned to their original &s;ize; in a little time, however, it returns to its natural thickne&s;s.</P>

<P>In the beginning of labour, the contraction of the womb, which accompanies every pain, pre&s;&s;ing generally upon its contents, natu|rally bears harde&s;t upon the lea&s;t re&s;i&s;ting parts; hence the mouth of the womb is gradually dilated: as this dilatation is encrea&s;ed by a repetition of pains, part of the bag, containing the fluid in which the child floats, is pre&s;&s;ed, in form of a bladder of water, into the opening, &s;tretching it in the man|ner of a wedge, acted upon by the &s;uperincumbent power of the pains; preparing the way (in a natural ca&s;e) for the bulky and more re&s;i&s;ting head of the child.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="038477_0084_101216385156C050">
As the labour advances, the wa|ters gather more and more, and u&s;ually, by the time the mouth of the womb is fully dilated, the membranous bag breaks by the force of the pains, and the waters are di&s;charged by a &s;udden gu&s;h. This terminates what is called the <HI>fir&s;t &s;tage</HI> of labour.</P>
<P>Frequently a remi&s;&s;ion of the pains follows the di&s;charge of the waters, but this is of but &s;hort duration.

<P>The membranes being broken, and the waters evacuated, the head now falls down into the cavity of the ba&s;on, and by the continua|tion of the pains, is forced for|ward, taking its natural turns, till at length it pa&s;&s;es through the bones, and pre&s;&s;es hard upon the external &s;oft parts, which, gradu|ally dilating, permit its pa&s;&s;age through them; when, u&s;ually, af|ter a &s;hort re&s;pite, another pain expells the &s;houlders, and the body and hips &s;oon follow.</P>
<P>The cour&s;e of a natural labour, as here de&s;cribed, you will not find to hold good in every ca&s;e, but diver&s;ified in a variety of par|ticulars: thus in&s;tead of the wa|ters being pre&s;erved till the full

In&s;tead of a temporary &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of pain upon the di&s;charge of the waters, you &s;ometimes will find the child expelled by the continuation and force of the &s;ame pain whereby they were broken: in other ca&s;es when the child does not immedi|ately follow the flow of the waters, yet the body will be born by the power of the &s;ame pain whereby the head is freed from the exter|nal parts; and in other ca&s;es again, where there has been &s;ome little re&s;pite after the birth of the head, it not unfrequently happens, that

<P>The pains continuing, after &s;ome little time, more or le&s;s, ac|cording as they may be, it will be prudent to <HI>examine again,</HI> to find how matters are going on; but we &s;hould be careful not to ex|amine, at lea&s;t not very critically, during the continuance of a pain, for fear of rupturing the mem|branes, whereby the opening of

<P>The fir&s;t &s;tage of the labour having con&s;iderably advanced, and the pains becoming more &s;evere, it will be prudent for the woman to be fixed in a proper po&s;ition for delivery, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> lying on her left &s;ide, with her back near the edge of the bed, and her knees drawn up and &s;eparated as before direct|ed.

<P>A few pains, at mo&s;t, now will clear the head from the&s;e parts; when after, perhaps, a little abate|ment, they are renewed and &s;oon force out the &s;houlders, during which al&s;o, we mu&s;t not neglect the perinaeum, which &s;till will be much upon the &s;tretch and in &s;ome danger of being injured. After the &s;houlders are born, we are not (as &s;ome are too apt to do) to lay hold of the child and ex|tract it, but with becoming pa|tience &s;till wait till nature &s;hall deliver it into our hands: we may, and indeed it will be proper for us, to &s;upport the body of the child, &s;o as, when it is naturally expelled, to be ready to take it, and directly to turn its face from towards the mother, to prevent its

<P>The child being wrapped in a warmed flannel, and a flannel cap put on (to protect its head from the too &s;udden impre&s;&s;ion of the cold air, which otherwi&s;e is very apt to give it the &s;nuffles) it &s;hould be permitted to lay, without being &s;eparated from the mother, till we have a <HI>full</HI> evidence of the change in the circulation of the blood be|ing completely made; not merely by the child's crying, but by the pul&s;ation in the navel &s;tring en|tirely cea&s;ing: then the cord may be firmly tied with a waxed thread in two places; one, about three fingers breadth from the navel, the other an inch further up: the child may then be &s;eparated by

<P>Some advi&s;e tying the cord and &s;eparating the child immediately after it is born, particularly if it cries heartily; but &s;urely the&s;e mu&s;t have but a very limited idea of the great change that takes place in the body of their little charge, when it fir&s;t begins to breathe, or they cannot believe but that it mu&s;t require &s;ome little time for its e&s;tabli&s;hment: indeed the gra|dual ce&s;&s;ation of the circulation in the cord after a few minutes, proves nature to be as fully ade|quate to the accompli&s;hment of this

I cannot however omit again enforcing it upon you, to aid phy&s;i|cians (when occa&s;ion may require) to overcome the prejudices of wo|men again&s;t cold applications in certain ca&s;es of flooding, the whole principle of their oppo&s;ition to this remedy being founded merely up|on its efficacy. They are fearful of its &s;uddenly checking the di&s;|charge, when that is the very
<PB N="103" REF="038477_0103_10121675B372F1B8">
object aimed at. Did my limits admit, I could repeat a number of ca&s;es, in &s;upport of what the ge|neral experience of others have proved, that they may be u&s;ed with as much &s;afety, and often-times with much more &s;ucce&s;s, than any others means. If women have a dread of water, there can be no great objection to a &s;mall proportion of &s;pirits or of vinegar being added; but by all means let it be <HI>cold.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot conclude without re|peating, in &s;hort, a few remarks upon the <HI>management of women du|ring the month, &s;o as to avoid many of the di&s;ea&s;es incident to that period.</HI></P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, the women, ought, if po&s;&s;ible, to lye-in, in a lofty, airy apartment, remote from the noi&s;e of the &s;treet. She &s;hould
<PB N="104" REF="038477_0104_1012167AAFD70E18">
(after having been put into a dry bed as before directed) be permit|ted to have a few hours quiet re|po&s;e, unmole&s;ted by the vi&s;its of either friends or formal acquaint|ances. After a few hours, the child &s;hould be applied to the brea&s;ts, to draw off the milk if they have any in them, or to &s;o|licit its gradual &s;ecretion, if it has not yet come, thereby preventing the many inconveniences ari&s;ing from the &s;udden flood of a great quantity at once into the brea&s;ts. The mother &s;hould always &s;et up <HI>in bed</HI> while &s;uckling, and when|ever &s;he eats: by this means &s;he will favour the natural di&s;charges from the womb, which when per|mitted to &s;tagnate, are often the cau&s;e of the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing di&s;|ea&s;es. With the &s;ame intentions, &s;he &s;hould al&s;o get out of bed, within twenty-four hours, or at
<PB N="105" REF="038477_0105_1012167DDD0181B0">
furthe&s;t two days after delivery; (if nothing in particular &s;hould render it improper) at which time her bed is to be made up and &s;heets changed. Her cloths &s;hould be frequently changed, and every care taken to remove all the offen|&s;ive matters which &s;eems &s;o di&s;po&s;|ed to accumulate about lying-in women. Her <HI>drinks</HI> &s;hould be of the milde&s;t, cooling kind, &s;uch as gruel, toa&s;t-water, barley-water, tea, &amp;c. her <HI>diet</HI> chiefly of vege|tables, as panado, &s;ago, tapioca, chocolate, &amp;c. with ripe fruits, but with very little if any wine or &s;pices:&mdash;After &s;ome few days, &s;he may indulge in boiled meats, and &s;o gradually re&s;ume her for|mer diet. Her bowels &s;hould be kept regular; &s;omething &s;hould pa&s;s them every day, which, if it does not take place naturally, mu&s;t be promoted by mild injections,
<PB N="106" REF="038477_0106_1012167F60002768">
as of warm water with a little &s;weet-oil or hogs-lard and mola&s;|&s;es; or if injections are objected to, &s;he may take a little ca&s;tor-oil, manna, or rochelle &s;alts. The <HI>room</HI> &s;hould be kept temperate, and by no means over-warm. All heat|ing drinks, or an accumulation of bed-cloaths, and indeed every thing that would heat her or pro|mote a &s;weating &s;hould be care|fully avoided: upon the &s;ame account, the <HI>curtains</HI> &s;hould be drawn up, &s;o as to let her have every advantage of fre&s;h, free air. By the&s;e means &s;he will go clear from many of the inconveniences common within the month. The manner in which many women are cooped on the&s;e occa&s;ions, leaves no difficulty in accounting for the many di&s;ea&s;es, child-bed fevers, agues in the brea&s;t, &amp;c.
<PB N="107" REF="038477_0107_1012168217B35648">
with which they are &s;o often af|flicted.</P>
<P>When women, by a kind of fal&s;e tenderne&s;s, are carefully pent up within clo&s;e-drawn curtains, and kept in a con&s;tant per&s;pira|tion, who can be &s;urpri&s;ed, that they &s;hould often be taking cold? for even turning in bed then mu&s;t be dangerous; the nece&s;&s;ary ex|po&s;ures from &s;itting up, in attend|ing to the calls of nature, or for &s;uckling their child, mu&s;t always be a great ri&s;k; the getting out of bed, the height of imprudence; and the lea&s;t breath of cold air will almo&s;t certainly di&s;order them.</P>
<P>When the woman's <HI>after-di&s;|charges</HI> are moderate, or even very <HI>&s;canty,</HI> no di&s;order attending, no means &s;hould be u&s;ed to increa&s;e them, excepting the getting up
<PB N="108" REF="038477_0108_10121686DD43F568">
often, and continuing longer and longer out of bed each time; this will favour their evacuation when accumulated in the womb; their &s;tagnation there, and not their &s;uppre&s;&s;ion, being the &s;ource of danger. When they are copious, the woman continuing well, they need no remedy; but when they are in <HI>exce&s;s</HI> and appear to induce weakne&s;s, and do not moderate by keeping in a horizontal po&s;ition; apply immediately for medical aid.</P>
<P>The milk ought not to be per|mitted to &s;tagnate in the brea&s;ts, but &s;hould be drawn off as often as four or five times a day. In ca&s;e the brea&s;ts &s;hould become hard or knotted, they may be rubbed with warm olive oil or goo&s;e grea&s;e, and afterwards covered with a plai&s;ter compo&s;ed of oil and bees|wax;
<PB N="109" REF="038477_0109_10121689DED2ABB8">
or, tho&s;e failing, they may have a cool poultice, made with bread and lead-water, or cloths wetted with lead-water, con&s;tantly applied to the part till the com|plaint is removed.</P>
<P>The nipples are &s;ometimes &s;o pre&s;&s;ed in, as not to be taken hold of by the child. They may be drawn out by cupping-gla&s;&s;es, or, what generally an&s;wers the pur|po&s;e equally well is, to take a com|mon black bottle, with a &s;mooth mouth, fill it with warm water, then empty it, and immediately apply the mouth of the bottle over the nipple; as it cools, the nipple will gradually be drawn out, &s;o as to be laid hold of without any more difficulty. Women's nipples being drawn out by &s;ucking, at the &s;ame time lo&s;ing, in a degree, the matters wherewith they are
<PB N="110" REF="038477_0110_1012168CD79AF418">
naturally covered and protected, and being afterwards, again pre&s;|&s;ed down by the women's cloaths, are very apt to crack open in dif|ferent places: this is often avoid|able, and frequently cured by care|fully wiping them dry, after the child has done &s;ucking, and wear|ing a wax ring, or leaden cap<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e rings are made by having a piece of bees-wax as large as half a dollar and near half an inch thick, perfectly &s;mooth, through which is to be made a hole &s;ufficiently large to take in the nipple. The leaden caps might, perhaps, with more propriety, be called hats, as they exactly re&s;emble them in &s;hape, the rim being half an inch wide and the bowl large enough to receive the nipple, perforated with &s;everal little holes, to per|mit what milk may be di&s;charged to run freely out.</NOTE> upon them, &s;o as to permit them to retain their &s;hape; having them at the &s;ame time, either covered with a &s;olution of the cooling emollient &s;eeds, particularly of quinces, or anointed with a little
<PB N="111" REF="038477_0111_1012169070800018">
beef's marrow, or an ointment made by melting equal parts of white wax and &s;permaceti with as much &s;weet oil as to make it of a proper con&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>Having thus followed the wo|man through the month, let us return to the child. We left it wrapped up in warm flannel till the woman could be fir&s;t accom|modated: now our little prize mu&s;t be attended to; it mu&s;t be wa&s;hed with warm water and &s;oap, have its navel &s;tring wrapped up in a piece of dry linen rag and laid upon its belly, where it mu&s;t be &s;ecured by a flannel belly-band, bound <HI>only moderately</HI> tight around the body of the child. The child mu&s;t, in other re&s;pects, be warm|ly and comfortably dre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>In regard to the <HI>dre&s;s</HI> of chil|dren,
<PB N="112" REF="038477_0112_101216935D503620">
this one principle &s;hould always be had in view, that the loo&s;er and ea&s;ier it is, the better; and that every binding that tends to cramp their motions or oppre&s;s their bodies, equally tends to in|jure their health. There cannot, however, be any great objection to &s;ecuring their little hands from rubbing their eyes; and trick that many of them are very much giv|en to. In fixing on their cloaths, as few pins &s;hould be employed as po&s;&s;ible; and indeed in no ca&s;e &s;hould they be u&s;ed where &s;trings can as well be &s;ub&s;tituted in their place.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t wa&s;hing, it was ob|&s;erved, &s;hould be with <HI>warm</HI> wa|ter. In the after-wa&s;hings, which &s;hould be at lea&s;t once every day, the heat of the water &s;hould be gradually dimini&s;hed, &s;o as by the
<PB N="113" REF="038477_0113_1012169604749C18">
third week at furthe&s;t to make it evidently <HI>cooler</HI> than the child's body; and, after a little while, if we would &s;ecure it again&s;t the vi|ci&s;&s;itudes of weather in our varia|ble climate, we &s;hould have it dip|ped in <HI>cold water</HI> every morning. By this treatment, two great points in pre&s;erving the health of chil|dren are obtained at once, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> cleanline&s;s and hardine&s;s. Man may truly be &s;aid to be the crea|ture of habit; by u&s;e he may be brought to take even poi&s;ons with impunity; &s;o, by a careful grada|tion, may infants be rendered, in a great degree, proof again&s;t the u&s;ual hurtful effects of cold.</P>
<P>This ine&s;timable pre&s;ervative, however, requires &s;ome caution in its application, to obtain its be&s;t
<PB N="114" REF="038477_0114_1012169C7373CC78">
effects. Children &s;hould be mere|ly dipped in the water, but not continued in it for any length of time, (and if they are very weak, the water &s;hould have a proportion of common &s;alt, as three or four ounces to a gallon, di&s;&s;olved in it) and upon their coming out, they &s;hould be wrapped in a flannel, and have their bodies well rubbed before they are dre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the general bath, the folds in the &s;kin, as of the neck, the arm-pits, the groins, behind the ears, &amp;c. &s;hould be wa&s;hed out &s;everal times in the cour&s;e of the day, with cold water, to pre|vent their chafing, particularly in fat children. If, notwith&s;tanding, the&s;e parts &s;hould chafe, in&s;tead of &s;imple water, they may be wa&s;hed
<PB N="115" REF="038477_0115_1012169DF60A0BA0">
frequently with cold hy&s;on tea, or a weak &s;olution of &s;ugar of lead, or of white vitriol, (in the propor|tion of fifteen or twenty grains to half a pint of rain water) and have them du&s;ted with a little dry flour or calamine powder.</P>
<P>Another main article in pre&s;erv|ing the health of children, is, the early habituating them to exerci&s;e and free air. If grown per&s;ons can hardly &s;upport them&s;elves without exerci&s;e and fre&s;h air, how can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that tender infants (who&s;e growth is to be expanded, and circulation extended, by the &s;ole power of their own &s;trength) can po&s;&s;ibly pro&s;per without them? Their con&s;tant unea&s;ine&s;s when kept &s;till, and the agreeable &s;atis|faction they expre&s;s upon being
<PB N="116" REF="038477_0116_1012169F7924FB88">
dandled about, fully prove the utility of that mea&s;ure; while the great and partial mortality among them in crowded places, clearly &s;hews their nece&s;&s;ity of the pure&s;t atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to the diet of chil|dren, there is nothing equal to their mother's milk, and where any &s;ub&s;titute or addition thereto is wanted, that which approaches the neare&s;t to it, is the be&s;t: none, perhaps, is better than cows milk, diluted with water and &s;weetened, or a little &s;alted when it appears to curdle much upon the &s;tomach. Bread and every other more &s;ub|&s;tantial food in any form, requires a degree of dige&s;tion which the &s;tomachs of infants, in their early days, are no ways calculated to
<PB N="117" REF="038477_0117_101216A2491FCCD8">
perform; hence, when they are &s;towed with pap or panado, &amp;c. they are &s;o often afflicted with a train of complaints in their little bowels.</P>
<P>It is a common thing with nur&s;|es, almo&s;t immediately upon the birth of the child, to give it &s;ome purgative to carry off the black matter contained in its bowels, and if its mother's fir&s;t milk does not an&s;wer that purpo&s;e, or if &s;he has not yet got any, or the child &s;ucks an older milk of a nur&s;e, this certainly is a very proper &s;tep. With this intention, a little manna and water, mola&s;&s;es or &s;yrup of ro&s;es, may be repeatedly given till it has its effect, or the babe may take a tea&s;poonful of a weak infu|&s;ion of rheubarb in water every
<PB N="118" REF="038477_0118_101216A8118FF8C0">
hour till it purges. Co&s;tivene&s;s, that may occur afterwards, will be be&s;t relieved by &s;uppo&s;itories or mild gly&s;ters.</P>
<P>The treatment of the <HI>di&s;ea&s;es</HI> of infants being the proper bu&s;ine&s;s of phy&s;icians, I &s;hall pa&s;s by no|ticing here. But, as in ca&s;es of apparently <HI>&s;till-born</HI> children, the nece&s;&s;ary means of their recovery would often come in too late, were you to wait till a phy&s;ician could be procured, I cannot omit again calling your attention to them.</P>
<P>It not unfrequently happens, that children do not, for &s;ome lit|tle time after they are born, &s;hew any &s;igns of life by crying or even breathing. Upon &s;uch occa&s;ions,
<PB N="119" REF="038477_0119_101216AB29193998">
I have often &s;et their re&s;piratory organs in motion, by blowing a &s;udden bla&s;t of air into their mouths. Should this not &s;ucceed, the child &s;hould be immer&s;ed in a bowl of warm water, and have its body rubbed over with the hand, while the circulation in the cord &s;hould be &s;upported or pro|moted (if it &s;hould have &s;topped) by wrapping it in a warm flannel. The&s;e means being continued for a few minutes, without any ap|pearance of life, and the pul&s;ation in the navel &s;tring appearing to be entirely and irrecoverably &s;top|ped, it may be tied and cut. The child &s;till continuing in the warm bath, is, by your blowing through a quill fixed into one of its no&s;|trils, while the other and its mouth are kept perfectly clo&s;ed, to have
<PB N="120" REF="038477_0120_101216AE8B89FAC0">
its little lungs dilated; then by pre&s;&s;ing on its belly and brea&s;t, the air mu&s;t be driven out again, when, in like manner, they may be filled and di&s;charged repeated|ly, imitating natural breathing as near as you can; this &s;hould be continued for a long time, unle&s;s the child &s;hould &s;ooner &s;how &s;ome &s;igns of life, by gaping &amp;c. after which &s;igns, if it &s;hould not &s;till breathe <HI>freely,</HI> it may be excited by a little &s;pirits or &s;nuff applied to its no&s;trils, or by &s;lapping it on its buttocks.</P>
<P>It &s;ometimes happens with &s;till|born children, that their counte|nances are of a dark livid colour, from a &s;tagnation of blood; in the&s;e ca&s;es it is nece&s;&s;ary to divide the navel &s;tring immediately, and
<PB N="121" REF="038477_0121_101216B112ED1BA8">
let it bleed a little before tying it; if this does not revive it, its lungs mu&s;t then be inflated as above di|rected; by a per&s;everance in which, many children have been recover|ed, to the no le&s;s a&s;toni&s;hment of de&s;pairing friends than enjoyment of their di&s;con&s;olate mothers.</P>
<P>Before we part, let me caution you again&s;t that &s;candalous di&s;po|&s;ition to defamation, &s;o prevalent among per&s;ons of the &s;ame pro|fe&s;&s;ion. Whatever may be your opinion of tho&s;e, who have not had like advantages with your|&s;elves, &s;till they are entitled to your compa&s;&s;ion and tenderne&s;s; your mild carriage will en&s;ure their affections, your in&s;tructive conver&s;ations may improve their practice, and excite in them a

laudable &s;pirit of further enqui|ry. In regard to your&s;elves, would you be re&s;pected by others, &s;hew a de&s;erving claim thereto, by your re&s;pect one towards another; if <HI>you</HI> &s;peak <HI>lightly</HI> one of another, wherefore can ye expect the <HI>world</HI> to &s;peak <HI>well</HI> of you.</P>
<P>Permit me to recommend to your particular attention, the calls of the poor, <Q><HI>He that hideth his face</HI> (from them) <HI>&s;hall have many a cur&s;e.</HI></Q> It was a &s;aying of a ce|lebrated phy&s;ician, that the <Q>poor were his be&s;t patients, becau&s;e God was their payma&s;ter.</Q> They are &s;aid to be the foot&s;teps whereby to a&s;cend to the apartments of the rich; but let not this &s;ordid mo|tive be the predominating princi|ple of your actions; let that be fix|ed
