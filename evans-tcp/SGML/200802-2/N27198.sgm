<HEAD>A SECOND ADDRESS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE partial change, which the events con|nected with the late epidemic have made in the minds of the citizens of Philadelphia re&s;pecting its origin, has encouraged me to attempt, by a &s;econd addre&s;s, to produce a more general conviction of truth upon this intere&s;ting &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Two opinions chiefly divide our phy&s;icians and citizens. The one con&s;i&s;ts in a belief that it is de|rived from a peculiar, or what is called a &s;pecific contagion; that it was imported from Siam in the Ea&s;t Indies nearly &s;ixty years ago into the We&s;t Indies, where it has prevailed ever &s;ince, and that it has been imported from thence from time to time into this city and other &s;ea-ports of the United States. Tho&s;e who deny this opinion, be|lieve it to be the common bilions fever of warm
<PB N="6" REF="036254_0005_1008A9956E4BDA38">
&s;ea&s;ons and climates&mdash;that it is generated from putrid matters by the heat of our &s;ummer and au|tumnal months, and that its late malignity is occa|&s;ioned by the atmo&s;phere having acquired, what has long been known among phy&s;icians by the name of an inflammatory con&s;titution.</P>
<P>If it be derived from the fir&s;t &s;ource that has been mentioned, the condition of our city is hope|le&s;s. <HI>It can never be eradicated.</HI> Our beds, cloth|ing, and even the timbers of our hou&s;es will retain it till the end of time. The &s;ooner therefore we de&s;troy our capital, and con&s;ign the &s;pot upon which it &s;tands, to pa&s;ture grounds, the better.</P>
<P>But our epidemic is not the Siam fever. The condition of our city is not hopele&s;s. The return of our di&s;ea&s;e may be prevented. Its feeds cannot be retained in our beds or hou&s;es from year to year, much le&s;s can they be imported. As well might a coal of fire be brought from one of the We&s;t India i&s;lands to this country, or a lump of ice be conveyed from this country to one of the We&s;t India i&s;lands, in the open air, as the yellow fever be imported from thence &s;o as to become <HI>general</HI> in our city.</P>
<P>The rare appearance of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es in Europe during the pre&s;ent century, has unfortu|nately
<PB N="7" REF="036254_0006_1008A9970B5780E0">
obliterated much of the knowledge which was formerly collected concerning them. The writers of the la&s;t century &s;peak con&s;tantly of the connection between putrid exhalations, an inflam|matory con&s;titution of the air, and malignant fevers. The animal and vegetable creation bear witne&s;s that &s;uch a &s;tate has exi&s;ted in the United States &s;ince the year 1791.&mdash;This inflammatory con&s;titution of the air is &s;ometimes local, but it more frequently pervades whole countries, and &s;ometimes the whole globe. The yellow fever has &s;eldom appeared in one part of America without appearing at the &s;ame time, or &s;oon afterwards in other parts. It was epidemic in Charle&s;ton and Philadelphia in 1699. And again in the &s;ame cities in 1799. It was &s;ickly in the <HI>country</HI> as well as in the city of Philadelphia in the year 1747. Of this fact the following extract of a letter from David Palmer to the late Edward Pennington, then in Barbadoes, politely put into my hands by his &s;on Edward, contains a &s;atisfactory document. The letter is dated the 29th of 6th month 1747. "People are exceeding &s;ickly in <HI>many parts of the country,</HI> and e&s;pecially in the city, where upwards of 20 are frequently buried in a day; the yellow fever being very brief, carrying off healthy people in two or three days."</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="036254_0007_1008A9989AE18FB0">It has been remarked in many publications upon this &s;ubject, that the inflammatory con&s;titution of the air had often been noticed by Hippocrates and Dr. Sydenham. I once believed the knowledge of this elementary fact in the &s;cience of medicine, to be general, but the publications of &s;everal Ameri|can phy&s;icians upon the yellow fever, have convinc|ed me that this is not the ca&s;e. From numerous te&s;timonies of a belief in the influence of a change in the in&s;en&s;ible qualities of the air, altering the character of epidemics, I &s;hall &s;elect the following.</P>
<P>"It is certain (&s;ays Dr. Mo&s;eley) that di&s;ea&s;es undergo changes and revolutions. Some continue for a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of years, and vani&s;h when they have exhau&s;ted the temporary but &s;ecret cau&s;e which produced them. Others have appeared and di&s;appeared &s;uddenly; and others have their periodical returns."</P>
<P>The Doctor a&s;cribes a malignant fever among the dogs in Jamaica (improperly called from one of its &s;ymptoms hydrophobia) to a change in the atmo&s;phere in the year 1783. It was &s;aid to have been imported, but experience, he &s;ays, proved the fact to be otherwi&s;e.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Treati&s;e upon Tropical Di&s;ea&s;es, p. 4<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="036254_0008_1008A99C40448EC8">"This latent malignity in the atmo&s;phere (&s;ays Baron Van&s;wieten) is known only by its effects, and cannot ea&s;ily be reduced to any known &s;pecies of acrimony." In another place he &s;ays, "It &s;eems certain that this unknown matter di&s;po&s;es all the humors to a &s;udden and bad putrefaction."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Commentaries on Boerhaave's Aphori&s;ms, Vol. V. p. 226, 230.</NOTE></P>
<P>Dr. John Stedman has related many facts in his e&s;&s;ay upon in&s;alutary con&s;titutions of the air, which prove, that di&s;ea&s;es are influenced by a quality in it which, he &s;ays, "is productive of corruption," but which has hitherto eluded the re&s;earches of phy&s;icians.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 135.</NOTE></P>
<P>Mr. Lempriere, a Briti&s;h military &s;urgeon, who has publi&s;hed in the pre&s;ent year practical ob&s;erva|tions upon the di&s;ea&s;es of Jamaica, after mention|ing the unu&s;ual mortality occa&s;ioned by the yellow fever within the la&s;t five or &s;ix years in that i&s;land, a&s;cribes it wholly "to that particular con&s;titution of atmo&s;phere upon which the exi&s;tence of epide|mics at one period rather than another, depend."<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. 31.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="036254_0009_1008A99DD4623360">The novelty of a di&s;ea&s;e is no proof of its im|portation. Dr. Sydenham de&s;cribes a fever which appeared with new &s;ymptoms in London in 1685. It was &s;o unlike all the epidemics he had &s;een be|fore, that he calls it a "new fever," but he does not upon this account hint at its being of foreign origin.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vol. II. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> Dr. Mo&s;eley &s;ays the common "nerv|ous remitting fever changed its type in Jamaica, in 1770. It raged with unu&s;ual violence, and car|ried off almo&s;t all the young people who were &s;eized. It returned in the &s;pring and &s;ummer of the two &s;ucceeding years, but has not been there in the &s;ame form, &s;ince" The Doctor does not de|rive it from another country, nor does he a&s;k, why did it not prevail in former years.</P>
<P>A malignant fever has lately appeared in York county in this &s;tate, which di&s;covers it&s;elf fir&s;t by a pain in the heel. The inhabitants of that coun|ty have never &s;u&s;pected it to be an alien di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The hi&s;tories of the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of our coun|try contain many accounts of the prevalence of the yellow fever among the Indians. The Creeks lo&s;t 600 of their nation by it in the year 1798.
<PB N="11" REF="036254_0010_1008A9A305E63D18">
Say, ye conjurers who pre&s;ide over the health of your tribes, did you ever dream that this di&s;ea&s;e was imported?</P>
<P>The influence of the atmo&s;phere and of other circum&s;tances, has been evinced in the changes which our autumnal fever has undergone &s;ince the year 1760. From that time till 1778 it appeared in the form of a mild intermittent, or a &s;low nerv|ous fever. After the year 1778 it appeared chief|ly in the form of a mild bilious remittent. Thou|&s;ands were affected by this fever in the year 1780. It was known by the name of the break bone fever. It made its fir&s;t appearance in Front &s;treet near the <HI>&s;hipping,</HI> and yet no one believed it, though a new di&s;ea&s;e, in &s;ome of its &s;ymptoms, to be of foreign origin. Since the year 1793, both the nervous and mild bilious fevers have nearly di&s;appeared, and an inflammatory intermit|ting, or remitting and malignant fever has taken their place. This change in the character of our autumnal fevers has been acknowledged by all our phy&s;icians. They unanimou&s;ly declare bark to be le&s;s effectual in them than in former years, and mo&s;t of them find it nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e blood-letting in a greater or le&s;s quantity, in order to cure them.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="036254_0011_1008A9A49D478778">It has often been a&s;ked, why was not the yellow fever common before the year 1793? If we ad|mit it to be imported, I beg leave to a&s;k, what has become of our nervous and mild remittents? Both que&s;tions can be an&s;wered in no other way, than by admitting, the former, to occupy the place of the latter.</P>
<P>It is no new thing for di&s;ea&s;es to vary, not only from changes in the atmo&s;phere, but from the pro|gre&s;s of agriculture and civilization in a country. Mr. Kalm tells us in his travels through North America, that the old Swedes whom he met on the creeks in We&s;t Jer&s;ey, told him that the bili|ous fever was a modern di&s;ea&s;e among them. Their ance&s;tors knew no other acute di&s;ea&s;e than pleuri&s;ies, and &s;uch other fevers as were produced by the changes in the weather in the winter and &s;pring months.</P>
<P>In no part of Europe, and in none of the We&s;t India I&s;lands, is the yellow fever believed to be &s;pread by contagion. Admitting it to be pro|pagated in Philadelphia by contagion, the mat|ter which compo&s;es it mu&s;t be &s;ubject to &s;ome laws. It ought to &s;pread where it prevails in the greate&s;t quantity, and in the mo&s;t con|centrated &s;tate, agreeably to what is ob&s;erved of
<PB N="13" REF="036254_0012_1008A9AAC7BD1440">
all other contagious di&s;ea&s;es&mdash;But this we know is far from being the ca&s;e. The di&s;ea&s;e has often been &s;aid to be communicated through a whole neighbourhood from a &s;uppo&s;ed infected &s;hip, and to affect a number of per&s;ons at a hundred yards di&s;tance from the &s;hip, and from each other, and yet the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e when carried into the healthy parts of the city, and even terminating in death with &s;ymptoms of what is called general putrefac|tion, has peri&s;hed without propagating it&s;elf in a &s;ingle in&s;tance. To &s;uppo&s;e it to be contagious under the above circum&s;tances, is to make a fea|ther, outweigh a mountain, or to believe one, to be more than a thou&s;and.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid in favor of the contagious qua|lity of this fever that it often &s;preads through a whole family when introduced into it by an indivi|dual. This is true, and &s;o does the common inter|mittent in the &s;outhern &s;tates, and yet no one has &s;uppo&s;ed this mild &s;tate of fever to be propagated by contagion. The &s;ame exhalation which pro|duces the di&s;ea&s;e in one member of a family, pro|duces it in mo&s;t ca&s;es in them all. Fear, grief, and the fatigue induced by attending the fir&s;t per|&s;on affected, are its u&s;ual exciting cau&s;es in all the re&s;t. There is no in&s;tance of an individual infect|ing
<PB N="14" REF="036254_0013_1008A9ADF4DCD640">
a whole family when he carries the di&s;ea&s;e into a dry and healthy part of the country.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here repeat an argument again&s;t the pro|pagation of the yellow fever by contagion, derived from its &s;udden and general extinction by means of early fro&s;t. The operation of cold in this form, is confined <HI>exclu&s;ively</HI> to the atmo&s;phere. It acts long before it becomes &s;o inten&s;e as to produce ice in our hou&s;es in which the contagion is &s;aid to be ac|cumulated, and, where the temperature of the air &s;eldom undergoes for many weeks, that degree of cold which is nece&s;&s;ary to de&s;troy the &s;eeds of the di&s;ea&s;e out of doors. I beg the reader to pau&s;e, and reflect upon this fact. It cannot be contra|dicted. Its evidence, un&s;upported by others, which oppre&s;s the &s;ubject by their number, is alone &s;ufficient to decide the que&s;tion in favour of the di&s;ea&s;e being derived exclu&s;ively from dome&s;tic exhalation, and exi&s;ting in the atmo&s;phere during the warm weather.</P>
<P>All error is at war with it&s;elf. It is painful to a citizen of Penn&s;ylvania to mea&s;ure the know|ledge of his fellow citizens by the pre&s;ent health law. The mo&s;t &s;evere penalties are threaten|ed upon per&s;ons who vi&s;it the We&s;t India &s;hips during their quarantine at the fort, even in ca&s;es where there is no &s;ick per&s;on on board of them,
<PB N="15" REF="036254_0014_1008A9B15DD5DCF8">
and yet the &s;ame law permits phy&s;icians, nur&s;es, and the members of the board of health to go into any hou&s;e or &s;treet they plea&s;e after attending, or vi&s;iting patients in the city in every &s;tage of the fever. But there is &s;omething much wor&s;e than folly in this health law. By admitting the yellow fever to be propagated exclu&s;ively by contagion, it has produced the de&s;ertion of the &s;ick by friends, and relations, and &s;ometimes the exclu&s;ion of &s;tran|gers to peri&s;h in the &s;treet, or in a barn. By the&s;e means, &s;o &s;hocking to humanity, it has added greatly to the mortality of the di&s;ea&s;e. It has moreover impo&s;ed a painful quarantine of fifteen or twenty days upon our mariners in a &s;ickly &s;itua|tion in the hot months, within a few miles of their friends.</P>
<P>It is worthy of notice, that quarantine laws have never been adopted by Britain, France nor Spain, in their long and exten&s;ive intercour&s;e with their re&s;pective i&s;lands, to guard again&s;t the importation of the yellow fever. To none of tho&s;e European countries has that fever ever been communicated by the &s;hoals of &s;ick, and convale&s;cent &s;ailors and &s;oldiers that have arrived in them, both in peace and war, from every part of the We&s;t Indies. Their quarantine laws are intended to operate chiefly again&s;t &s;hips coming from the Levant and
<PB N="16" REF="036254_0015_1008A9B39F9F8138">
other &s;ources of the plague. It was becau&s;e we derived the yellow fever from We&s;t India contagion in 1793, that the court of London impo&s;ed a qua|rantine upon ve&s;&s;els coming from Philadelphia in that year. Our ob&s;tinate attachment to this opini|on, has produced a general belief in Europe that our fever <HI>is not</HI> the fever of the We&s;t Indies, for this is now known not to &s;pread by contagion. But further; our quarantine has combined our &s;i&s;ter &s;tates again&s;t us, by teaching them to adopt our error, as &s;oon as the di&s;ea&s;e makes its appear|ance among us, and thereby to add to the inju|ries which our city has &s;u&s;tained by the diminution of our European commerce.</P>
<P><HI>Accidental coincidence</HI> is a frequent &s;ource of er|ror. A pe&s;tilential fever which accidentally &s;uc|ceeded the introduction of the potatoe into France, produced an edict again&s;t the cultivation and u&s;e of that whole&s;ome root by the French court. There was a time in the infancy of medical knowledge in Philadelphia, when the autumnal fever was a&s;crib|ed to the u&s;e of the water-melon, a fruit which above all others is calculated to prevent it. In like manner, the arrival of a &s;hip from the We&s;t Indies, and the &s;ickne&s;s or death of a &s;ailor induced by the putrid exhalation of our docks and wharves, occurring in the months of July or Au|gu&s;t,
<PB N="17" REF="036254_0016_1008A9B843A8D420">
(the u&s;ual time of our bilious fevers appear|ing) has unfortunately connected them together as cau&s;e and effect, by an a&s;&s;ociation as unfounded as the two &s;imilar errors that have been mentioned.</P>
<P>It is curious to ob&s;erve the relation&s;hip of the human race e&s;tabli&s;hed in every part of the world, not le&s;s by the form of their bodies, than by their re&s;emblance in the nature of their errors.</P>
<P>There is not a nation upon the face of the earth, that admits the plague to be of dome&s;tic origin. It has been cha&s;'d from country to coun|try, until it has been fought for in the planets. Nay, further, from the reluctance which all nati|ons feel to becoming the parents of this di&s;ea&s;e, they have overlooked phy&s;ical or &s;econd cau&s;es in its generation, and have derived it from heaven it&s;elf. Whatever may be its de&s;ign; it is unnece&s;|&s;ary to &s;uppo&s;e a miraculous departure from the ordinary means by which Providence governs our world, to take place in its production.</P>
<P>A &s;imilar relation&s;hip is e&s;tabli&s;hed between na|tions remote from each other, and differing in a hundred particulars, in adopting certain errors as the means of perpetuating their mi&s;ery. The &s;eeds of the plague have been pre&s;erved for &s;everal
<PB N="18" REF="036254_0017_1008A9BD37589440">
centuries in Turkey by a belief in prede&s;tination. The &s;eeds of the yellow fever have been pre&s;erved in Philadelphia for five years, by a belief in impor|tation.</P>
<P>The fraternity of mankind appears &s;till further in the folly of the mea&s;ures they have adopted to relieve them&s;elves from their calamities. A pic|ture of the Virgin Mary was fixed upon a gate at Mo&s;cow to &s;top the progre&s;s of the plague in that city in the year 1771. The primate of Mo&s;cow was torn to pieces by a deluded mob for an at|tempt to cure their prejudices by removing that picture. Equally ab&s;urd and ineffectual have been our quarantines to prevent the annual return of the yellow fever, and nearly as &s;ucce&s;sful for a while have been the attacks upon the characters of the phy&s;icians who have attempted to &s;how their in|&s;ufficiency for that purpo&s;e, as the outrage was upon the life of the innocent and benevolent Ru&s;|&s;ian Archbi&s;hop.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid by &s;ome Phy&s;icians, that intermitting, and mild bilious fevers only, are produced by exhalations from mar&s;hes and al&s;o &s;ources of putrefaction.

been mentioned in former publications, that the mo&s;t malignant and fatal epidemics are the off|&s;pring of the &s;ame obvious and putrid cau&s;es. They are calculated not only to convince, but to alarm every per&s;on who has fixed his hopes of &s;afety upon a quarantine law, and lived at ea&s;e amid&s;t filth and danger in our city, and its neigh|bourhood.</P>
<P>In the memoirs of the Academy of Sciences for the year 1796, there is an account by Mr. Pitot of a mortal di&s;ea&s;e that prevailed in Languedoc, which was found to be occa&s;ioned by &s;tagnating water. In a town called Ague-morte in the year 1745 out of near 1800 per&s;ons, but ten or twelve e&s;caped the prevailing fever. Of the children alone there died 200 of tho&s;e who were affected. The town of Frontignan, but three leagues from that healthy city of Montpellier, was nearly depo|pulated, and the village of Baleruc in the &s;ame neighbourhood, lo&s;t three-fourths of its inhabi|tants by this fatal epidemic. It was remarkable, &s;ays Mr. Pinot, that it increa&s;ed, and declined in its mortal effects according as the waters were permit|ted to &s;tagnate, or not, in tho&s;e and other adjoin|ing places.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="036254_0019_1008A9C0AC495F30">In the Rev. Mr. Town&s;end's travels through Spain,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE> we find the following account of a malig|nant fever produced by putrid exhalations in the neighbourhood of Carthagena, the mortal effects of which were equal to tho&s;e which have occurred in 1797, and 1798, from a &s;imilar cau&s;e in our city. "Of di&s;ea&s;es, the mo&s;t endemical, are intermit|tent and <HI>putrid</HI> fevers.

<P>In the valuable work by Mr. Lampriere before quoted, there are many proofs of the connection between putrid exhalations and the yellow fever in the We&s;t-Indies.

There is one fact related by this au|thor which &s;hould lead our citizens to attend to the &s;ources of putrid exhalation at a di&s;tance from the city. He &s;ays, upon the authority of an emi|nent

<P>In a manu&s;cript account of the life of the late Doctor, afterwards Governor Colden of New York, there is the following fact:<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> October 30th, 1799.</NOTE></P>
<P>"A malignant fever having raged with exceed|ing violence for two &s;ummers &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in the city of New-York, about forty years ago, he com|municated his thoughts to the public, on the mo&s;t probable CURE of the calamity. He publi&s;hed a little treati&s;e on the occa&s;ion, in which he collected the &s;entiments of the be&s;t authority, on the bad effects of <HI>stagnating waters, moist air, damp cellars, filthy &s;hores,</HI> and <HI>dirty streets.</HI> He &s;hewed how much the&s;e nui&s;ances prevailed in many parts of the city, and pointed out the remedies. The cor|poration of the city voted him their thanks, a|dopted his rea&s;oning, and e&s;tabli&s;hed a plan for
<PB N="22" REF="036254_0021_1008A9C6EB091700">
draining and cleaning the city, which was attend|ed with the mo&s;t happy effects."</P>
<P>If a belief in the importation of the yellow fe|ver produced no other evils than a mi&s;application of public money, and a neglect of internal means to prevent it; the error would be a &s;erious calami|ty to our city. But it is accompanied with other evils which are of a much greater magnitude. It is the &s;ource of all the di&s;&s;entions of our Phy&s;icians upon the &s;ubject of the <HI>treatment</HI> of the fever, and of nearly all the mortality which has attended it &s;ince its appearance in our city in the year 1793. The truth of this a&s;&s;ertion will I hope appear by the following con&s;iderations:</P>
<P N="1">1. There has been but one morbid &s;tate of the body, or in other words, but one epidemic di&s;ea&s;e in our city for &s;everal years in the &s;ummer and au|tumnal months; and this di&s;ea&s;e is at all times the offspring of putrid exhalation. It is known by many names, &s;uch as diarrhoea or lax, colera mor|bus, or a vomiting and lax, dy&s;entery or bloody flux, bilious colic, nervous fever, and bilious re|mitting fever. Let not the reader he&s;itate in ad|mitting this propo&s;ition. He admits a truth which is &s;imilar to it. Every body believes the gout to
<PB N="23" REF="036254_0022_1008A9CB5B1015D8">
be a <HI>&s;ingle</HI> di&s;ea&s;e, and yet it is well known that it occupies under the different circum&s;tances of con|&s;titution and &s;ea&s;on, the &s;tomach, bowels, lungs, and brain as well as the limbs.&mdash;In &s;upport of this remark, I might add further the authority of ma|ny re&s;pectable authors, and produce many hun|dred ca&s;es to &s;hew that all the&s;e different forms of di&s;ea&s;e frequently appear in the &s;ame per&s;on in the cour&s;e of two, or three days, ju&s;t as the gout ap|pears in all the parts of the body that have been named, in the cour&s;e of the &s;ame fit.</P>
<P N="2">2. Mild intermitting, the common remitting, and the malignant intermitting and remitting yellow fever are all different grades of the &s;ame form of di&s;ea&s;e, and derived from the &s;ame cau&s;e. It is &s;trange that this a&s;&s;ertion &s;hould ever have been denied or even doubted by any per&s;on that has &s;een the immen&s;e difference between the mild di&s;tinct, and the malignant confluent &s;mall pox. No one has ever &s;uppo&s;ed them to be &s;pecifically different in their origin and nature, and yet the milde&s;t intermittent does not differ more from the malignant yellow fever, than the &s;mall pox by in|oculation does from that grade of it which is at|tended with an univer&s;al and connected eruption on the &s;kin, livid &s;pots, and hemorrhages from all <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> apertures of the body.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="036254_0023_1008A9CD77B7A430">It is to be lamented that medicine is &s;till in the pagan and &s;avage &s;tate from which religion and philo&s;ophy have happily emerged in our country.

The benefit of the&s;e precau|tions will be much aided by keeping up a con&s;tant and perceptible per&s;piration by means of warm dre&s;&s;es.

and at the &s;ame time by attacking it before it has time to collect and pour its whole force upon the &s;y&s;tem. The above remedies are generally effec|tual for this purpo&s;e. I am &s;ure I have &s;een the di&s;ea&s;e prevented by them in many hundred in|&s;tances. It is thus by a &s;ingle bucket of water, we extingui&s;h a fire which, if left to it&s;elf, would con&s;ume a hou&s;e.

<P N="4">4. To treat no form of di&s;ea&s;e as trifling, after a &s;ingle ca&s;e of the yellow fever appears in the ci|ty. Many thou&s;and people in Philadelphia &s;till de|plore the lo&s;s of relations in whom a yellow &s;kin, a black vomiting and the hor&s;e have followed a di&s;|ea&s;e which was unfortunately believed in its fir&s;t &s;tage to be nothing but an intermittent, a colic, the gout, and even a common cold.</P>
<P N="5">5. A belief in the unity of our autumnal di&s;|ea&s;es, will produce unity in &s;entiment and practice among our phy&s;icians, an event which never can take place, while one &s;ect looks wholly at the vio|lence and &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e, and another looks for &s;igns of a &s;hip, or proofs of contagion for the indications that are to be pur&s;ued in the

<P N="6">6. Such a belief will deliver tho&s;e phy&s;icians who call a malignant ca&s;e of fever by its unpopular name, from the abu&s;e and per&s;ecution which have followed &s;uch acts of candor and benevolence, and prevent all tho&s;e arts of &s;ecrecy, or deception, which have been re&s;orted to by &s;ome of the fa|culty to retain their peace, and reputation with their fellow citizens.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;ame cruel practice of concealing the exi&s;tence of the plague, or of calling it by le&s;s unpopular names has been impo&s;ed upon phy&s;icians in many countries, and has always produced the mo&s;t de&s;tructive con&s;equences.

tolerating a &s;pirit of independence and humanity, among the phy&s;icians would be very great. No &s;ooner would the fir&s;t ca&s;e of yellow fever become public, than all the precautions that have been enumerated would become general. The di&s;ea&s;e would thereby be prevented, or ea&s;ily cured. Fear would be de&s;troyed, or le&s;&s;ened, and the de|&s;ertion of the city become le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary. There was a time when a thunder gu&s;t produced uni|ver&s;al terror, and &s;ometimes flight into the open air. At pre&s;ent we continue bu&s;ine&s;s and conver&s;a|tion in our hou&s;es, without the lea&s;t fear from its explo&s;ions over our heads. Nearly equal &s;afety is in our power from the yellow fever, by an early choice of the proper means to prevent it.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="036254_0028_1008A9DF0F2DB630">As the mortality of our autumnal fever has been much increa&s;ed by certain prejudices and errors which prevail more or le&s;s, among all cla&s;&s;es of our citizens, re&s;pecting its treatment, I &s;hall add a few remarks upon this &s;ubject.&mdash;They &s;hall be premi&s;ed by three propo&s;itions.</P>
<P N="1">1. The bilious fever in all its forms, is varied by <HI>climate.</HI> It is a widely different di&s;ea&s;e in our city, and in the We&s;t Indies, and requires a very different mode of treatment in both countries. Of this Dr. Stevens has furni&s;hed by his practice a memorable proof. He recommended bark, wine and the cold bath for the cure of the yellow fever of 1793, becau&s;e he had &s;een tho&s;e remedies mo&s;t effectual in the yellow fever of St. Croix; but he laid all tho&s;e remedies a&s;ide, and relied chiefly upon a &s;alivation for the cure of the fever of 1797 in Philadelphia.</P>
<P N="2">2. The bilious fever is varied by <HI>&s;ea&s;on.</HI> It has appeared with new &s;ymptoms every year &s;ince 1793, and has required a difference in the force and nature of its remedies. The &s;ame difference appeared in the epidemies in London in the time of Dr. Sydenham. This was &s;o great, that the Doctor candidly acknowledges, he generally lo&s;t three or four of the fir&s;t patients he &s;aw in a new
<PB N="30" REF="036254_0029_1008A9E0A4675DD0">
di&s;ea&s;e, before he di&s;covered the changes which had been induced upon it by the weather.</P>
<P N="3">3. The &s;ymptoms of the bilious fever are varied by the <HI>age, &s;ex,</HI> and <HI>habit.</HI> It is &s;eldom exactly alike in any two per&s;ons. It generally appears with the mo&s;t force, in a part of the body which has been previou&s;ly &s;ubject to weakne&s;s, or di&s;ea&s;e. Per&s;ons of robu&s;t habits &s;uffer mo&s;t from it. Hence it appears in its mo&s;t malignant form in new comers in the We&s;t Indies, while in the Creoles or na|tives, and in per&s;ons who&s;e bodies have been a&s;&s;i|milated to the climate by ten or twelve years re&s;i|dence in the I&s;lands, it puts on the form of a mild remittent.</P>
<P>It is common for phy&s;icians to de&s;cribe what they called <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, or characteri&s;tic &s;ymp|toms of the yellow fever. But from the circum|&s;tances that have been mentioned which vary this di&s;ea&s;e, it would be nearly as ab&s;urd to expect the &s;ame form and dimen&s;ion of a cloud under every variety of weather and &s;ea&s;on, as to expect an epidemic with exactly the &s;ame &s;ymptoms in every country, in every year, and in every con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The&s;e propo&s;itions being admitted, I go on to remark that a malignant bilious <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;omething
<PB N="31" REF="036254_0030_1008A9E415C43078">
like a &s;torm in the &s;y&s;tem. It produces derange|ment in the circulation of the blood and total or par|tial ob&s;tructions of all the u&s;ual excretions or di&s;|charges of the body; hence ari&s;e preternatural excitement or &s;trength in the action of the moving fibres of the body, particularly the blood ve&s;&s;els, al&s;o fulne&s;s, pre&s;&s;ure upon particular parts, and pain. Sometimes this preternatural &s;trength is thrown upon the bowels, where it produces vio|lent &s;pa&s;ms, pain, puking and co&s;tivene&s;s. In proportion as &s;trength is accumulated in the blood ve&s;&s;els, or bowels, it is ab&s;tracted from the limbs, and hence the inability to walk or move in &s;ome of the forms of this fever.</P>
<P>Sometimes the &s;timulus of the exhalation acts upon the blood ve&s;&s;els of the limbs and &s;urface of the body, with &s;o much force, as to pro&s;trate them <HI>below</HI> their common and natural actions. This is the mo&s;t dangerous form of malignant fever. It is known not only by a feeble and &s;low pul&s;e, but by a cool &s;kin, and the ab&s;ence of pain.</P>
<P>The remedies proper to remove this deranged &s;tate of the &s;olids, and accumulation of the fluids, in all the numerous cavities of the body, and there|by to equalize the actions of the former, and to
<PB N="32" REF="036254_0031_1008A9E5B2E0CBA8">
re&s;tore the latter to their natural determinations, are EVACUANTS.</P>
<P>The&s;e are bleeding, purges, vomits, &s;udorifics, and a &s;alivation. To the&s;e evacuating remedies may be added cold air, cold water and ice. They act by evacuating the heat of the body, when it is preternatural. They have all been con&s;idered as different remedies by &s;ome phy&s;icians, but they all act in <HI>one</HI> way, that is by depleting, or emptying the &s;y&s;tem of a <HI>preternatural</HI> quantity of fluids, or ab&s;tracting their u&s;ual and natural quantity, when the &s;olid parts of the body are &s;o much irri|tated, or inflamed, as not to be able to bear their cu&s;tomary &s;timulus. Mild ca&s;es of the fever, yield to purges, and &s;weats alone; more violent ca&s;es require the addition of bleeding, and vomits, and ca&s;es of great malignity require the combined ac|tion of all the evacuating medicines that have been mentioned.</P>
<P>To &s;uppo&s;e the &s;ame remedies are proper in the yellow fever in our climate that are u&s;ed with &s;uc|ce&s;s in the We&s;t Indies, is as ab&s;urd as it would be to u&s;e the cotton and linen dre&s;&s;es of that country, in our autumnal and winter months.</P>
<P>To pre&s;cribe the &s;ame remedies in every ca&s;e of yellow fever, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> any regard to its vio|lence,
<PB N="33" REF="036254_0032_1008A9E8A5FB4C10">
is as ab&s;urd as it would be to attempt to clothe all the citizens of Philadelphia with dre&s;&s;es of the &s;ame form and &s;ize. There is no &s;uch thing as a &s;pecific, which acts in a &s;ecret and un|known manner without any &s;en&s;ible evacuation from the body, in curing this fever. Yea&s;t, lime|water and milk, plantain juice, and centaury tea, have now and then ea&s;ed trouble&s;ome &s;ymptoms, but none of them ever cured a malignant ca&s;e of yellow fever. If ever durable relief has followed their u&s;e, it has been, when they have co-operated with more powerful means in promoting di&s;charges from the bowels, or pores.</P>
<P>The force of the evacuating remedies above mentioned, mu&s;t be accommodated to the force of the di&s;ea&s;e. I &s;hall endeavour to illu&s;trate this proportion between the force of the yellow fever, and the proper remedies to cure it, by a familiar &s;imile. Let us &s;uppo&s;e the natural &s;trength of a con&s;titution to be ten. Let us then &s;uppo&s;e the different degrees of force in the fever, to range from 10 to 100, while the force of the remedies extends from 11 to 110. The point to be gained, is to reduce the force of the di&s;ea&s;e by the proper remedies <HI>below</HI> 10, &s;o that the con&s;titution may be &s;uperior to it, and thus overcome it. In mild <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> when the force of the di&s;ea&s;e exceeds but a
<PB N="34" REF="036254_0033_1008A9EA35C73A28">
few degrees the &s;trength of the con&s;titution, a gentle purge or a &s;weat will turn the &s;cale in favor of health, but where the di&s;ea&s;e ri&s;es in its vio|lence to 100, the powers of medicine, between that number and 110, will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ubdue it. It is common to &s;ay of tho&s;e remedies, that they are wor&s;e than the di&s;ea&s;e. This mode of &s;peaking is perfectly correct. They mu&s;t be <HI>wor&s;e,</HI> or in other words, <HI>more</HI> powerful than the di&s;ea&s;e, or they will not cure it.</P>
<P>During the two la&s;t years, profu&s;e &s;weating, has been the exclu&s;ive and popular remedy in the yellow fever with many people. It acts by de|pleting, or le&s;&s;ening the fulne&s;s of the blood ve&s;|&s;els. It is now and then &s;ucce&s;sful, but even when it is &s;o, compared with the efficacy of blood letting, it is like waiting till a pond of &s;tagnating water near a dwelling hou&s;e is di&s;&s;ipated in vapor by the heat of the &s;un, in&s;tead of removing it in a few hours by a prompt and copious drain.</P>
<P>But &s;weating is often an impracticable remedy. In the fever of 1793 all attempts to excite &s;weats were ineffectual. Where the&s;e attempt fail, they do harm, but where they &s;ucceed in the mo&s;t copi|ous manner the di&s;ea&s;e is not always cured by
<PB N="35" REF="036254_0034_10088FC747476358">
them, as hundreds can te&s;tify in the years 1798 and 1799.</P>
<P>Some practitioners rely <HI>exclu&s;ively</HI> upon a &s;aliva|tion to cure the yellow fever. It is too &s;low and too feeble in its operation, for rapid and violent ca&s;es. Mercury is moreover an uncertain remedy when u&s;ed alone, not more than one in four per|&s;ons being &s;alivated by it.</P>
<P>Bleeding has the following advantages to recom|mend it.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is &s;uited to the <HI>&s;eat</HI> and <HI>nature</HI> of the di&s;|ea&s;e. The yellow fever is always accompanied with inflammation in &s;ome part of the body. Out of 130 per&s;ons whom Dr. Phy&s;ick examined after death from this di&s;ea&s;e, did not find one in whom there were not marks of <HI>inflammation</HI> in the &s;tomach, and occa&s;ionally in the bowels, kidneys and brain.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is a <HI>prompt</HI> remedy, and requires le&s;s pa|rade of attendance and nur&s;ing than &s;weating, pu|king, or a &s;alivation. It is moreover &s;ubject to the controul of a phy&s;ician as to the <HI>time</HI> of u&s;ing it, and as to the <HI>quantity</HI> of fluids to be obtained by it from the body.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="36" REF="036254_0035_1008A9F11A0C59A8">3. It is a le&s;s weakening remedy than any other. It is likewi&s;e much &s;afer than puking and &s;weating, and far le&s;s di&s;agreeable than a &s;alivation. Its &s;afety is guaranteed by the <HI>pul&s;e.</HI> This index of the force of a fever will always, when under&s;tood and attended to, prevent any exce&s;s in the u&s;e of the lancet. No other remedy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;uch a faithful criterion by which we can judge of the nece&s;&s;ity of increa&s;ing, or withholding evacuations.</P>
<P N="4">4. It <HI>aids</HI> the operation of all the other evacu|ating remedies, and renders them le&s;s dangerous by fir&s;t le&s;&s;ening the violent commotions, and in|flammation in the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P N="5">5. It le&s;&s;ens, or removes pain, and prevents tho&s;e alarming di&s;charges of blood from the no&s;e, mouth, lungs, &s;tomach, bowels, &amp;c. which ari&s;e from the bur&s;ting of the blood ve&s;&s;els, in con&s;e|quence of their being overpre&s;&s;ed, or acting with preternatural force.</P>
<P N="6">6. It is a more delicate remedy than any of tho&s;e which have been exclu&s;ively preferred to it. It offends no &s;en&s;e, and renders &s;ick people le&s;s di&s;agreeable to them&s;elves, and their attendants.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="036254_0036_1008A9F56EA1BE80">In mentioning the&s;e advantages of blood letting, let it not be &s;uppo&s;ed, that I wi&s;h an exclu&s;ive de|pendence to be placed upon it&mdash;all the other evacu|ating remedies &s;hould be combined with it according to circum&s;tances&punc; The degrees of it, mu&s;t be ac|commodated to the force of the di&s;ea&s;e, and this, as has been remarked, will generally manife&s;t it&s;elf by the &s;tate of the pul&s;e.</P>
<P>Before I di&s;mi&s;s the &s;ubject of blood letting in the yellow fever, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to point out two or three of the principal errors that have prevailed in the u&s;e of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. It has been &s;aid that great &s;en&s;ible weakne&s;s, is an objection to blood letting. This weakne&s;s in the beginning, and frequently in every fit of the yellow fever, &s;o far from forbidding the lo&s;s of blood, is the mo&s;t vehement call of the &s;y&s;tem for it. It ari&s;es from the blood ve&s;&s;els being &s;o much overcharged with blood, that they pre&s;s upon the nerves of the mu&s;cles which move the limbs, and thereby deprive them of their u&s;ual &s;trength. By opening a vein, we remove this pre&s;&s;ure, and the weakne&s;s occa&s;ioned by it; hence we ob&s;erve patients who were unable to move before bleeding; imme|diately afterwards to leave their beds, and in &s;ome in&s;tances, to re&s;ume in a few hours, their ordinary bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="38" REF="036254_0037_1008A9F964437A50">2. It has been &s;aid, that bleeding &s;hould always be proportioned to the con&s;titution of the patient. This opinion is not ju&s;t. A man may have a very &s;trong con&s;titution, and a weak di&s;ea&s;e which re|quires the lo&s;s of but little blood to cure it, while on the contrary a woman may have a weak con&s;ti|tution, and a &s;trong di&s;ea&s;e which will yield only to the frequent u&s;e of the lancet. The pul&s;e in both the&s;e ca&s;es will always afford a &s;ure mark to di&s;criminate the di&s;ea&s;e, from the con&s;titution.</P>
<P N="3">3. It has been &s;aid, that bleeding &s;ometimes ex|cites pain where it did not exi&s;t before, and even increa&s;es the force and frequency of the pul&s;e. The&s;e &s;ymptoms, &s;o far from being an objection to this remedy, are a proof that it has done &s;er|vice, by changing a &s;uffocated and latent di&s;ea&s;e into a &s;en&s;ible one. They are a call of the &s;y&s;tem for more blood letting.</P>
<P>In favor of the u&s;e of ALL the remedies, that have been mentioned in the treatment of the yel|low fever, it may be &s;aid that they have been adopted in all the ea&s;tern and &s;outhern &s;tates, and that they are u&s;ed in Philadelphia by mo&s;t of the phy&s;icians who formerly oppo&s;ed them. They are moreover far more &s;ucce&s;sful in their combination, than any <HI>one</HI> of them has been, when exclu&s;ively u&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="036254_0038_1008A9FB50186838">The following fact is a &s;triking proof of the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion.</P>
<P>Four times as many per&s;ons were affected by the yellow fever in 1793, as in 1798. The mor|tality in both years was nearly equal. In 1793 bleeding, (in addition to other depleting remedies) was &s;o general, that many thou&s;and people bled them&s;elves, without the advice of a phy&s;ician. In 1798 this remedy, in con&s;equence of the weak and unrea&s;onable fears that were excited again&s;t it the year before, was but little u&s;ed, and the cure of the di&s;ea&s;e was tru&s;ted chiefly to gentle purges, mercury, and &s;weating medicines. It is true, it bore le&s;s copious bleeding in 1798 than in 1793, but there were few ca&s;es of it which did not re|quire the lo&s;s of a greater or le&s;s quantity of blood.</P>
<P>Could the u&s;e of the depleting &s;y&s;tem in all its parts, be begun according to circum&s;tances, on the <HI>first</HI> day of the fever, and could patients have, throughout all its &s;tages, the u&s;ual advantages of good nur&s;ing, con&s;tant and regular medical attend|ance, comfortable apartments, family &s;ociety, and exemption from terror, that are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in other acute di&s;ea&s;es, there is good rea&s;on to believe the mortality from it, would not be greater than from a common pleuri&s;y.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="036254_0039_1008A9FE14D2F2A8">I have hitherto &s;aid nothing of the u&s;e of bark, wine and opium in this fever. They have been &s;uppo&s;ed to be indicated by the debility which <HI>al|ways</HI> precedes the fever, from the operation of its exciting cau&s;es, and by the weakne&s;s which gene|rally accompanies it. But many facts &s;hew, that the weakne&s;s in both the&s;e ca&s;es does not con&s;ti|tute the di&s;ea&s;e. It is its predi&s;po&s;ing cau&s;e, or an accidental &s;ymptom only, and is frequently increa&s;|ed by tonic remedies. The weakne&s;s which fol|lows the u&s;e of evacuations, and the cri&s;is of the fever, is mo&s;t ea&s;ily, and &s;afely removed by plea&s;ant and nouri&s;hing aliment.</P>
<P>Thus have I endeavoured to di&s;charge tho&s;e ob|ligations to &s;ociety which nearly forty years inqui|ries and ob&s;ervations in medicine, have impo&s;ed upon me. Should this attempt be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> un&s;ucce&s;sful in producing the effect intended by it, as my former ones have been, I &s;hall hereafter mourn in &s;ecret over the continuance of an error which has been &s;o fatal to the citizens of Philadelphia, and deprecate the refutation of it, by a repetition of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ufferings. One con&s;olation will be mingled with the gloomy review of my abortive <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and that is, a belief that time will do <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> opinions, and that heaven will acquit <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"></P>
