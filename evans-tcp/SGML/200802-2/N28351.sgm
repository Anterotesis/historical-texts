<BIBL>PSALM CXLIV, 12.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>That our &s;ons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner &s;tones poli&s;hed after the &s;imilitude of a palace</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is natural for us to look forward with the hope of future good. This anticipation of futurity is one evidence of our immortality. We weary our&s;elves to find happine&s;s in this world: but our labours are baffled, and our expecta|tions di&s;appointed. We are never at re&s;t, until we are &s;ettled in the firm belief, and filled with the cheerful hope of happine&s;s in the world to come. In youth, while we are climbing the hill of life, we amu&s;e our&s;elves with the pro&s;|pect which opens before us: but when we have pa&s;&s;ed the &s;ummit, and are treading the downward path, the worldly pro&s;pect &s;hortens&mdash;and &s;hortens, the &s;hadows &s;tretch over us, and we find our&s;elves, at every &s;tep, &s;inking into the dark|&s;ome vale of infirmity and age. Our earthly pro&s;pects are now in po&s;terity: Our brighter pro&s;pects are in God.</P>
<P>THE parent rejoices to &s;ee his children ri&s;ing to virtuous dignity and u&s;efulne&s;s. The hope that he &s;hall live in them&mdash;that his labours will contribute to their happine&s;s&mdash;that their worthy conduct will embalm his name and re&s;cue it from oblivion, con&s;oles him in the melancholy thought of his ha&s;tening di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>THE patriot has much the &s;ame feelings toward his coun|try, as the parent toward his family. He delights in its pre&s;ent pro&s;perity&mdash;he &s;eems to &s;hare in its di&s;tant glory&mdash;he appropriates the happine&s;s it will enjoy after his connection with it &s;hall cea&s;e. It is this anticipation which prompts his exertions for the advancement of arts, learning and reli|gion. When David, in the p&s;alm before us, prayed that God would deliver the people of I&s;rael from the inva&s;ion of foreign enemies, who were &s;trangers to the true God, he had regard not only to the pre&s;ent, but to &s;ucceeding generations.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="037783_0004_100F4CDE947653B8">
Rid me and deliver me from the hand of &s;trange children, who&s;e mouth &s;peaketh vanity, and who&s;e right hand is a right hand of fal&s;e-hood, that our &s;ons may ri&s;e like young flouri&s;hing trees, until they attain their full &s;tature and &s;trength; and our daughters adorned with virtuous manners, may &s;tand like pillars of poli&s;hed marble, which beautify and &s;upport a palace.'</P>
<P>HE deprecated the admi&s;&s;ion of foreigners, the wor&s;hippers of fal&s;e gods, into his country, le&s;t &s;ucceeding generations &s;hould be corrupted in their principles and manners, and thus the &s;entiments of piety and virtue &s;hould be bani&s;hed from the land.</P>
<P>HENCE then we learn the &s;en&s;e which David had of the importance of the ri&s;ing generation. This is the thought which I intend to illu&s;trate and improve.</P>
<P>GOD has appointed the human race to be continued by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; and each generation is an e&s;&s;ential link in the chain.</P>
<P>THE Creator has framed a univer&s;e, and peopled it with an endle&s;s variety of beings, ri&s;ing in a gradual &s;cale from the borders of nothing upwards to a degree of perfection be|yond our pre&s;ent conceptions. In this &s;cale the human &s;pe|cies holds an important place. However &s;mall we my appear in compari&s;on with angels; yet, con&s;idered as rational and immortal beings, de&s;igned for an endle&s;s exi&s;tence, and capa|ble of continual improvement in knowledge, virtue and hap|pine&s;s, we are of va&s;t importance.</P>
<P>THE particular regard, which the Creator has &s;hown for us in providing a world for our habitation, in &s;preading around us bountiful &s;upplies for our wants&mdash;in appointing his angels to be our mini&s;ters and guardians&mdash;in giving his Son to re|deem us from the ruins of our apo&s;tacy&mdash;and in furni&s;hing us with the nece&s;&s;ary means of &s;cientific, moral and religious advancement, &s;hews that we are beings of di&s;tingui&s;hed im|portance in his univer&s;al plan, and that by means of our race &s;ome grand and glorious purpo&s;es are to be an&s;wered.</P>
<P>IF our race is &s;o important, we are not to look with indif|ference on the generation which is ri&s;ing after us. They are rational and immortal beings&mdash;they are in a &s;tate of pro|bation&mdash;they are a part of that &s;pecies which the Son of God
<PB N="5" REF="037783_0005_100F4CE0E28C5088">
came to redeem&mdash;and they are the per&s;ons on whom the con|tinuance of our race depends.</P>
<P>THEY are of <HI>particular</HI> importance in the <HI>families</HI> to which they belong.</P>
<P>WHEN our children are young, we ob&s;erve with plea&s;ure the gradual opening of their tender minds toward rea&s;on and maturity. We promi&s;e our&s;elves &s;till greater &s;atisfaction, when we &s;hall one day &s;ee them acting a worthy part on the &s;tage of life. Our labour and expence in their &s;upport and education are encouraged by the expectation of their pre&s;ent improvement and future u&s;efulne&s;s; and amply repaid, when this expectation is realized.</P>
<P>MANY of the &s;ervices nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;upport of human life call for the vigour, activity and enterprize of youth, and mu&s;t be entirely neglected, if none were found but &s;uch as have pa&s;t this &s;prightly period. It is the ri&s;ing generation which mu&s;t be our &s;upport and comfort in that evil day, 'when the keepers of the hou&s;e &s;hall tremble, and the &s;trong men &s;hall bow them&s;elves&mdash;when the doors &s;hall be &s;hut in the &s;treets, and they that look out at the windows &s;hall be darkened&mdash;when we &s;hall ri&s;e up at the voice of the bird and fear &s;hall be in the way.' In the pro&s;pect of this uncomfortable &s;ea&s;on, it is a relief to hope that we &s;hall be &s;trong in the vigour, and &s;ecure in the virtue of tho&s;e who are growing up under our care. In this view, children are an heritage of the Lord, and as arrows in the hands of the mighty.'</P>
<P>THE ri&s;ing generation are of great importance in <HI>civil &s;o|ciety.</HI> The defence of the &s;tate in a time of war, and the promotion of arts in a time of peace, depend chiefly on <HI>them.</HI> As we advance toward old age, our &s;pirit for enterprize, our re&s;olution to meet danger, and our ability to &s;u&s;tain hard|&s;hip, &s;en&s;ibly decline. In this languid period, our exertions are prompted by the &s;pirit of our children, and &s;trengthened by our regard for their intere&s;t. Were it not for their lively ambition, and our parental affection, we &s;hould langui&s;h out the latter part of life in a dull pur&s;uit of the old beaten track. It is the ardour of the &s;on, which gives activity to the expe|rience of the father. The ambition of the former, directed by the prudence and checked by the caution of the latter, operates to u&s;eful improvements, and keeps the world in progre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="037783_0006_100F4CE32C8D8098">
THEY who are now young are &s;oon to take into their own hands the great affairs of &s;ociety; and general peace, or con|fu&s;ion will be connected with the part they act. By their virtue and prudence, they will diffu&s;e happine&s;s around and tran&s;mit it to the next &s;ucceeding age; or by their folly and vice they will &s;pread general mi&s;ery and entail it on tho&s;e who &s;hall come after them.</P>
<P>ON the ri&s;ing generation will depend the continuance and increa&s;e of <HI>u&s;eful knowledge.</HI></P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent advanced &s;tate of the mechanical and liberal arts by which life is embelli&s;hed, and the mind enlarged is the work of many ages. The early condition of mankind was rude and uncultivated. Their fir&s;t occupations were &s;uch as nece&s;&s;ity dictated, and piety pre&s;cribed&mdash;the culture of the ground for food, and the keeping of &s;heep &amp; cattle for cloath|ing and for &s;acrifice. Their labours in opening the ground for pa&s;turage, and in mellowing the &s;oil for corn, mu&s;t, for want of in&s;truments, have been difficult and &s;low. We have no account of the u&s;e of iron and bra&s;s until the eighth gene|ration from Adam. For a long time mankind had much dependence on the &s;pontaneous productions of the earth. Their fir&s;t cloathing was made of the &s;kins of bea&s;ts. The manufacture of wool and other materials was a &s;ub&s;equent invention. The&s;e probably were fir&s;t wrought, not by the contexture of threads, as they are now among us; but by the contu&s;ion of the ma&s;s until the natural fibres were incorpo|rated; as is &s;till the method among &s;ome &s;avage tribes. About the time that bra&s;s and iron came into u&s;e, was invented the con&s;truction of tents, and the formation of mu&s;ical in&s;tru|ments. It was a long time before the &s;trength of bea&s;ts, the impul&s;e of wind, the weight of water-falls, and the mechan|ical powers of the wheel and the pully, were applied to re|lieve the weakne&s;s and lighten the labour of men. The long|evity of the fir&s;t generation, was favorable to improvement. But while the art of writing was unknown, the progre&s;s of invention mu&s;t have been very moderate, and its communi|cation much confined. Geography would &s;carcely extend beyond the limits of their own travels&mdash;mathematicks would be little more than the enumeration of their flocks and herds&mdash;a&s;tronomy would be only &s;uch an ob&s;ervation of the &s;tars as was nece&s;&s;ary to guide them in their journey, and direct them in their hu&s;bandry. The fir&s;t writing was by the pic|tures
<PB N="7" REF="037783_0007_100F4CE4D7451B88">
and &s;ymbols of things; which would be but few, and the&s;e often of doubtful &s;ignification. It is a que&s;tion wheth|er alphabetical writing can be traced higher than the time of Mo&s;es. If letters were known earlier, probably they were of the nature of our numerical figures, the &s;igns of ideas, rather than of &s;ounds. Alphabetical writing greatly facili|tated the progre&s;s of learning, which has &s;ince been much improved by the invention of printing. The diffu&s;ion of knowledge has been greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the art of navigation, which has opened an ea&s;y communication among the nations of the earth. Mankind are &s;till making progre&s;s; and a few generations hence may have the benefit of arts as much un|known to us, as were the magnet and printing type, a few centuries ago; or &s;ome late invented engines in the beginning of the pre&s;ent century.</P>
<P>OUR elevation in arts and refinement is the acqui&s;ition of ages. If this were by any means lo&s;t, ages and ages mu&s;t pa&s;s away before it would be again recovered: And it is doubtful whether mankind could &s;urvive the lo&s;s. The ri&s;|ing generation are the depo&s;itaries of the&s;e trea&s;ures of &s;cience. Into their hands we are to commit them: And they, in their turn, mu&s;t convey them, with their own additional improve|ments, to the generation which &s;hall &s;ucceed them.</P>
<P><HI>Religion</HI> is a matter of &s;till higher importance. With this the pre&s;ent pro&s;perity and future felicity of mankind are e&s;|&s;entially connected. The care God has taken to impart to us the knowledge of it by the mini&s;try of his own &s;on, and of holy men in&s;pired with his own Spirit, demon&s;trates our infinite concern in it. He taught it to former ages in a &s;u|pernatural way. In the&s;e ages he leaves it to be conveyed on from one generation to another by means of a &s;tanding re|velation and an in&s;tituted mini&s;try. If religion &s;hould be ge|nerally neglected, revelation exploded and the mini&s;try di&s;con|tinued in one age, the next would come forward in ignorance of the truth and in depravation of manners; and of con&s;e|quence would experience all the mi&s;eries of prevailing wick|edne&s;s in this world, and &s;tand expo&s;ed to its more dreadful effects in another.</P>
<P>WE are placed under a government the mo&s;t liberal and happy of any known among the nations of the earth. But our government re&s;ts on the ba&s;is of religion, and with|out
<PB N="8" REF="037783_0008_100F4CE79B3BF450">
out it cannot be &s;u&s;tained in its pre&s;ent form. There may, indeed, be government without religion; but it will be a go|vernment of terror and force; not of rea&s;on &amp; ju&s;tice. When I&s;rael was without the true God, without a teaching prie&s;t, and without the law, there was no peace to him, that went out, not to him that came in; but great vexations on the in|habitants. The experiment of government without religion has lately been made in Europe; and its effects have been too di&s;a&s;trous to justify a repetition. A man mu&s;t be either blinded by enmity to truth, or very carele&s;s in his ob&s;erva|tions on the tendency of things, not to have &s;een, in the cour&s;e of a few years pa&s;t, the connection of religion with the hap|pine&s;s of &s;ociety, and the operation of infidelity to produce mi&s;&s;ery and confu&s;ion. On this &s;ubject experience and ob|&s;ervation have thrown &s;uch light, as human rea&s;oning could not have di&s;played. And there is ground to hope that reli|gion has received &s;ome additional &s;upport in this land from the attempts to undermine it in another. As we wi&s;h to leave with our children the privileges of a free government, we mu&s;t train them up in the faith and obedience of the go&s;|pel. The pre&s;ent youth are the per&s;ons by whom religion is to be pre&s;erved and communicated in the world. If in their hands it &s;hould be lo&s;t, there is no rea&s;on to expect a new re|velation to re&s;tore it: But the ignorance and irreligion be|gin in them will run on and &s;pread round, how far, and how wide, none can tell. Such is the corruption of human na|ture that its tendency is not to amendment, but to increa&s;ing depravation. This will be the effect, when re&s;traints are ca&s;t off, and the means of knowledge and virtue are thrown a&s;ide. Hence God threatens, that he will vi&s;it the iniquities of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation of them that hate him. Not that he will puni&s;h the <HI>obedient</HI> for the iniquities of their fathers; but he will puni&s;h the&s;e iniquities in the children who <HI>retain</HI> them and <HI>continue</HI> to hate God as their fathers have done before them. The threat|ning is grounded on a natural pre&s;umption, that the children, from one generation to another, will adopt and practi&s;e their fathers' &s;ins.</P>
<P>WHEN we con&s;ider, that the virtue, liberty and happine&s;s of many generations will depend on the youth who are now coming forward, and that unborn millions will be happy or mi&s;erable here and for ever, according as the&s;e &s;hall &s;upport
<PB N="9" REF="037783_0009_100F4CE950168F90">
or neglect religion, we mu&s;t regard them as beings of mighty con&s;equence to the world and feel our&s;elves bound to treat them accordingly.</P>
<P>OUR preceeding ob&s;ervations fully evince, that the educa|tion of youth is an object which demands our mo&s;t zealous attention. There is no way in which we can &s;o e&s;&s;entially promote the great intere&s;ts of humanity, as by training up this young generation to indu&s;try, &s;cience and religion. Hap|py will be our nation while their &s;ons are as plants grown up in their youth, and their daughters as corner &s;tones poli&s;hed after the &s;imilitude of a palace. The &s;tructure of &s;ociety mu&s;t not be an un&s;hapely pile of rude &s;tones promi&s;cuou&s;ly thrown together, as they are taken from the quarry; but a compact and well proportioned edifice of regular pieces, fitted each to its place, poli&s;hed by the tool of education, and clo&s;e|ly united by the cement of benevolence and virtue. The for|mer, horrible while it &s;tands, will &s;oon tumble into ruins; the latter, beautiful in its appearance, will be permanent in duration.</P>
<P>THE education of youth mu&s;t be begun in the families in which they are placed. But it cannot be completed here. As they are growing up to be members of a larger &s;ociety, &s;ome publick provi&s;ion ought to be made for their obtaining a more elevated education, than can be given them within their native walls.</P>
<P>IN the &s;ettled &s;tate of the Jewi&s;h nation, &s;eminaries were early erected, and liberally endowed for the education of young men to publick u&s;efulne&s;s, e&s;pecially to offices in the church. To pre&s;ide in the&s;e &s;chools, per&s;ons eminent for their wi&s;dom, learning and &s;anctity were appointed; and into them were freely admitted &s;uch young men as di&s;covered a ta&s;te &amp; aptitude for u&s;eful knowledge. To the&s;e &s;chools Solomon probably alludes in the beginning of the IX Chapter of Pro|verbs. <Q>Wi&s;dom hath builded her hou&s;e, &s;he hath hewn out her &s;even pillars; &s;he hath killed her bea&s;ts; &s;he hath mingled her wine; &s;he hath al&s;o furni&s;hed her table. She hath &s;ent forth her maidens; &s;he crieth upon the highe&s;t places of the city.</Q> And this is her cry; <Q>Who&s;o is &s;imple, let him turn in hither. Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled. For&s;ake the fooli&s;h and live; and go in the way of under&s;tanding.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="037783_0010_100F4CEC5E2E3240">
<Q>THE early Chri&s;tians,' &s;ays Dr. Mo&s;heim, took all po&s;|&s;ible care to accu&s;tom their children to the &s;tudy of the holy &s;criptures, and to in&s;truct them in the doctrines of their holy religion. For this purpo&s;e &s;chools were every where erected, even from the commencement of the Chri&s;tian church. Be&s;ides the &s;chools de&s;tined for children, there were Academies erected in &s;everal large cities, in which per&s;ons of riper years, e&s;pecially &s;uch as a&s;pired to be pub|lick teachers, were in&s;tructed in the different branches of human learning and &s;acred erudition. And we may un|doubtedly attribute to the Apo&s;tles them&s;elves and their injunctions to their di&s;ciples the excellent e&s;tabli&s;hments, in which the youth de&s;tined for the holy mini&s;try received an education &s;uitable to the &s;olemn office they were to un|dertake.</Q></P>
<P>THE legal in&s;titution of &s;chools in their &s;everal grades is a privilege which commenced with the &s;ettlement of New-En|gland, and which has had the mo&s;t happy effects. By means of this in&s;titution our children are early formed to the love of knowledge, to &s;entiments of virtue, to decency of manners, to habits of &s;ubordination, and to a preparation for publick u&s;efulne&s;s. To this it is greatly owing that knowledge is &s;o generally diffu&s;ed, and that civil &s;ociety is in &s;o orderly and peaceful a &s;tate.</P>
<P>THE ordinary &s;chools maintained in our &s;everal towns are well adapted to the object of their in&s;titution. But it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary there &s;hould be &s;ome in &s;ociety, who have an educati|on &s;uperior to that which the&s;e &s;chools are competent to fur|ni&s;h. For this purpo&s;e our colleges are founded. But a regular collegiate education is beyond the reach of of many happy geniu&s;es who wi&s;h to ri&s;e above the education of an ordinary &s;chool. Therefore certain intermediate &s;emina|ries are in&s;tituted by authority, &amp; endowed by publick grants and private benefactions, that with moderate expen&s;e the lov|ers of learning may obtain an education which will gratify their literary ta&s;te, and lay a good foundation for farther im|provements and for more general u&s;efulne&s;s.</P>
<P>OF this kind is the WESTFIELD ACADEMY, which we, this day, dedicate to the purpo&s;e of erudition, and commend to the ble&s;&s;ing of Providence.</P>
<P>IN con&s;equence of an application from the citizens of this
<PB N="11" REF="037783_0011_100F4CEE9C4F7790">
town, the legi&s;lature of our Commonwealth have here in|&s;tituted an Academy, endowed it with competent priviledges, and appropriated for its u&s;e a valuable tract of land, which, with the addition made by the town, will we hope, &s;oon prove a fund competent to the purpo&s;es of the in&s;titution. By a farther grant of the town and the &s;ub&s;criptions of particular Gentlemen in it, an elegant and capacious edifice is erected for the accommodation of &s;tudents, and now prepared for their reception; and a gentleman of approved ability and character is procured, and is now pre&s;ent to who&s;e immedi|ate government &amp; in&s;truction the &s;tudents will be committed.</P>
<P>THE object of the in&s;titution is to train up youth of both &s;exes in virtue and &s;cience. Reading, writing, arithmetic, elegant compo&s;ition, and graceful &s;peaking will be here taught. Such as a&s;pire to a higher education will be a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed in acquiring a knowledge of the learned languages, geo|graphy, mathematicks, and &s;uch other branches of erudition as are taught in our univer&s;ities. Particular attention will be given to the morals of the youth; and in&s;truction in the principles and duties of religion will not be neglected. With a view to the&s;e objects the Tru&s;tees will ever be careful, that the preceptors and teachers in this Academy be men of di&s;|tingui&s;hed learning and exemplary conver&s;ation, and that they be the profe&s;&s;ed friends of piety and religion.</P>
<P>A STRICT government will be nece&s;&s;ary in the Academy. But this will be maintained, not by corporal or nece&s;&s;ary puni&s;hments; but by means better adapted to influence in|genuous minds. Offenders, on whom &s;uch means are un&s;uc|ce&s;sful, will be deemed unworthy of a place in the Academy; and they mu&s;t retire.</P>
<P>THE expen&s;e of tuition will be as moderate as the &s;upport of the in&s;titution will allow; and as &s;oon as our funds come into operation, we hope this expence will be reduced.</P>
<P>THE funds and donations already committed, and &s;uch as may hereafter be committed to the Tru&s;tees, will be faithful|ly appropriated; the will of benefactors will be religiou&s;ly obeyed, and a &s;trict oeconomy will be ob&s;erved. We anticipate the time, when this in&s;titution will become re&s;pectable for numbers, order, virtue and &s;cience, under the care of able in|&s;tructors and the patronage of liberal benefactors. We hope,
<PB N="12" REF="037783_0012_100F275FF2E553D0">
from the proceeds of our funds and from the munificence of the friends of &s;cience, &s;oon to &s;ee the Academy furni&s;hed with a nece&s;&s;ary philo&s;ophical apparatus, a u&s;eful library, and a valuable collection of curio&s;ities, to &s;timulate the enquiries and a&s;&s;i&s;t the improvements of the &s;tudents. But an infant in&s;titution mu&s;t have time for growth and maturity.</P>
<P>THE progre&s;s, reputation and u&s;efulne&s;s of this Academy will much depend on the wi&s;dom and virtue of the people, &amp; e&s;pecially of the influential characters of the town in which it is placed.</P>
<P>WE commend the zeal and liberality of the town in the cau&s;e of learning and religion. We applaud the genero&s;ity and publick &s;pirit of tho&s;e gentlemen, who, in addition to the grant of the town, have largely contributed to the erection &amp; completion of the edifice, which we this day dedicate to vir|tue and &s;cience. But remember, gentlemen, your work is only begun. If it &s;top here, your labor and expen&s;e are lo&s;t, and the laudable purpo&s;e of your exertions is defeated. You have done much in pecuniary contributions: You have &s;till much to do in another line. There is a duty which you owe and which you will continually owe to this in&s;titution. As it is placed among you, &s;o on your virtuous influence its re&s;pectability; yea, its exi&s;tence will principally depend. Had we the remote&s;t idea, that the youth who become its members, would here be contaminated in their principles and depraved in their manners, and go abroad to &s;pread the cor|ruption among others, we &s;hould by no means have given it our countenance, nor this day have a&s;&s;i&s;ted in its dedication. Should this unhappily prove to be the ca&s;e, no virtuous pa|rent will &s;end a &s;on or daughter to it for an education; and it will, of con&s;equence, expire in di&s;grace. With a regard to the u&s;efulne&s;s of the in&s;titution, the intere&s;t of its mem|bers, the good of our country and the honor of religion, we expect&mdash;&amp; we &s;hall require, that the pupils be re&s;trained from impiety, profanene&s;s, di&s;&s;ipation, riot and gambling&mdash;from mingling with licentious company, and re&s;orting to places of temptation. Let there then be nothing of this kind among you. We expect&mdash;and we &s;hall require, that they here be nurtured in the principles of religion, in &s;entiments of piety, in habits of virtue, in a love of order, in decency of behav|iour,
<PB N="13" REF="037783_0013_100F4CF28067FD18">
in &s;obriety of manners, in a reverence for, and attend|ance upon the in&s;tituted wor&s;hip of God. Among you let the&s;e things be con&s;picuous. You ea&s;ily &s;ee, that the ob|tainment of our object will materially depend on the wi&s;e &amp; virtuous conduct of the citizens and youths of this town. It will be difficult&mdash;it will be impo&s;&s;ible for the immediate gov|ernors of the Academy to pre&s;erve order and virtue among their pupils amids counter examples; but amid&s;t concurrent examples their ta&s;k will be ea&s;y.</P>
<P>WILL not my age, my tru&s;t, my appointment for this day excu&s;e me, and entitle me to your attention, my young friends while I exhort you, in regard to your own reputation and &s;afety&mdash;in regard to the honor of this infant in&s;titution&mdash;in regard to the youths who &s;hall &s;eek an education here, to &s;hun and dete&s;t tho&s;e evil communications which corrupt good manners? Let it never be reported abroad, or known here, that any of you are profane, di&s;orderly, riotous, gamblers, &s;abbath-breakers, &s;coffers at religion, lovers of &s;inful plea|&s;ures, and enticers to evil. Let it appear, and let it every where be &s;poken to your honor, that you are &s;ober, virtuous, godly, obedient to dome&s;tic order, and ob&s;ervant of religious wor&s;hip. Then our &s;ons and daughters, who come to re&s;ide among you, will from your example learn the things which are virtuous and prai&s;e worthy, the things which are lovely and of good report. Then you will not only feel a con&s;cious plea&s;ure in your own virtue, but enjoy an additional &s;atisfac|tion in having diffu&s;ed its influence far around.</P>
<P>YOU who are ma&s;ters of families are always under &s;acred obligations; but now you will be under <HI>new</HI> obligations, to watch over your children and dome&s;tics, and to maintain or|der, virtue and religion in your hou&s;es; for you will thus render a mo&s;t important &s;ervice to the children of your bre|thren abroad. In &s;ome of your families our children mu&s;t re&s;ide. Let them there hear nothing, but what de&s;erves their attention&mdash;&s;ee nothing but what is worthy of their imitati|on. Let them &s;ee peace and harmony, government and &s;ub|ordination, a reverence for God's word and an ob&s;ervance of his wor&s;hip. Let them hear nothing impious and profane, di&s;re&s;pectful of the &s;criptures, or contemptuous of divine in&s;ti|tutions. Treat our children as <HI>your own;</HI> at lea&s;t &s;o far as to give them &s;ea&s;onable cautions and rebukes. We feel a
<PB N="14" REF="037783_0014_100F4CF7E37437B8">
&s;olicitude for our children, when they are removed from un|der our eye. A per&s;ua&s;ion that they are placed in orderly and religious families and under the in&s;pection of our pious and faithful friends, greatly relieves our anxiety.</P>
<P>I BEGIN to fear, I &s;hall be thought to have &s;tepped over my line. Your goodne&s;s, however, will excu&s;e the tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion. I &s;peak not the&s;e things from an apprehen&s;ion of any <HI>peculiar</HI> danger in this town. I honour you as the friends of order, virtue &amp; religion. But in regard to this infant academy, and to the youth who may &s;eek an education in it, I felt an impul&s;e of duty, which I could not ea&s;ily repre&s;s, to hold up to you &s;ome &s;alutary cautions. In expre&s;&s;ing my own feelings, I am &s;ure, I expre&s;s tho&s;e of my brethren of the board.</P>
<P>TO the preceding cautions I will add another, which more immediately re&s;pects rhe officers, magi&s;trates, and influential characters in the Town. Will it not, Gentlemen, be parti|cularly incumbent on you to u&s;e the authority and influence which you po&s;&s;e&s;s, I will not &s;ay, for the <HI>&s;uppre&s;&s;ion,</HI> for I know not that &s;uch things exi&s;t here; but for the <HI>prevention</HI> of the evils which have been mentioned; profanene&s;s, gamb|ling, &s;abbath-breaking, and whatever would tend to vitiate the manners, fully the reputation and defeat the intention of this academy? Will it not be your duty to countenance and encourage the religious ob&s;ervance of the Lord's day, and a regular and general attendance on the wor&s;hip of God's hou&s;e; that the &s;tudents, from the example which they behold, may receive deep and permanent impre&s;&s;ions of the &s;acred impor|tance of the&s;e divine in&s;titutions?&mdash;I &s;hall not enlarge&mdash;You will judge of your&s;elves what is right.</P>
<P>THIS day introduces a new year&mdash;the year which clo&s;es the 18th century from the era of your redemption. On this day we are a&s;&s;embled to dedicate to God and commit to his ble&s;&s;ing this infant &s;eminary, hoping, that here our &s;ons will be as plants grown up in their youth, and our daughters as corner-&s;tones poli&s;hed after the &s;imilitude of a palace&mdash;that here formed to u&s;eful knowledge, pious &s;entiments and vir|tuous manners, they will bring honour to God, do &s;ervice to men in their day, and tran&s;mit to another generation the pious principles and the excellent wi&s;dom, which they here
<PB N="15" REF="037783_0015_100F4CF9C737ABE8">
imbibe. That God may accept this offering at our hands, let us join piety with our charity, like the <HI>Mecedonian</HI> Chri&s;|tians, who, in preparing a benefaction for the &s;aints, fir&s;t gave <HI>them&s;elves</HI> to the Lord. In vain we pretend to honour him with pompous offerings, while we deny him the affecti|on of our hearts and the obedience of our lives. Let us, with this new year, lament our own follies, and recognize God's mercies in the pa&s;t. And with the dedication of this new &s;eminary, let us pre&s;ent our&s;elves living &s;acrifices holy and acceptable to him, and &s;erve him the remainder of our days in newne&s;s of life. When our bodies &s;hall be forgotten in the du&s;t, and our names no longer mentioned on earth, may this in&s;titution live and flouri&s;h, and be a ble&s;&s;ing to the children of tho&s;e who &s;hall then occupy our place. In the mean time our prayers &s;hall commend it to God, and in his attendant &s;miles our hearts &s;hall rejoice. Having clo&s;ed this mortal &s;cene, may we all ri&s;e to the world of light, where we &s;hall &s;ee, not thro' a gla&s;s darkly, but with open face, and &s;hall know, not merely in part, but as we are known.</P>

<HEAD>DEDICATION SPEECH. By the honorable SAMUEL FOWLER, E&s;q. Pre&s;ident of the Board of Tru&s;tees.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN and Fellow Citizens.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE have A&s;&s;embled this day for the delightful pur|po&s;e of dedicating, and &s;etting apart this building for the important de&s;ign of education, that the ri&s;ing generation may be in&s;tructed in the various branches of human and &s;a|cred erudition.</P>
<P>WE rejoice that this happy lot has fallen to us, and that we have an opportunity to impart a &s;mall portion of our proper|ty in laying the foundation of &s;o u&s;eful an In&s;titution.</P>
<P>The attention of the Citizens of this Commonwealth to the education of the ri&s;ing Generation affords a mo&s;t plea&s;ing pro&s;pect of the future &s;upport of religion &s;cience and morality. The&s;e are the Grand Pillars, on which this Country has been rai&s;ed to its pre&s;ent opulence and &s;plendor, and on which the principles of our mo&s;t excellent Frame of Government mu&s;t be continued and &s;upported. Having compleated this Aca|demic Edifice, and procured an in&s;tructor for the education of tho&s;e Children and Youth of both &s;exes, who may be commit|ted to his care; having al&s;o received ample te&s;timony of his literary and moral character; to introduce this Gentleman into his important office is what now remains for us to do.</P>
<P>I therefore, by the direction of this Honorable Board of Tru&s;tees, deliver to you, Sir, <HI>this Key,</HI> in token of your in|ve&s;titure with the office of Preceptor in this Academy.</P>
<P>UPON your exertion aided with ours, we conceive the fu|ture pro&s;perity of this Seminary very much depends.</P>
<P>IT is our ardent wi&s;h, that you may an&s;wer our ju&s;t expec|tations, in forming the minds and manners of the Children and Youth, that may be placed under your in&s;tructions.</P>
<P>PERMIT us, Sir, on this occa&s;ion, to &s;ugge&s;t to you the im|portance of carefully in&s;pecting the morals and behaviour of your Pupils; and of frequently in&s;tiling into their tender minds the great principles of the chri&s;tian religion: The re&s;t we leave to your own good &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>WE look forward with plea&s;ing &s;ati&s;faction to &s;ome future Period (far di&s;tant) when you &s;hall re&s;ign this Key and Office of preceptor, with honor to your&s;elf and reputation to this Seminary.</P>
<P>MAY this in&s;titution long flouri&s;h; may it become more and more reputable for virtue and &s;cience; &amp; may it continue to afford an opportunity for acquiring every branch of learing which is u&s;eful to the individual and beneficial to the Community.</P>
