<P>POTTSTOWN, JANUARY 12th, 1800. Ye&s;terday the Inhabitants of this village and its vi|cinity a&s;&s;embled, to add their tribute of love and veneration for the great and good GENERAL WASHINGTON, to that &s;o univer&s;ally paid by other parts of his admiring country.&mdash;The morning was u&s;hered in by firing &s;ix|teen guns, and a gun was afterwards fired every half hour during the day. About noon a military and ma&s;onic proce&s;&s;ion was formed, which proceeded in the following order to the Church, the mu&s;ic playing a &s;olemn dirge&mdash;the bell being muffled, and minute guns firing during the whole ceremony.</P>

<BIBL>2 SAMUEL, Chapt. 3, vers 38.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Know ye not that there is a Prince and a great Man fallen this Day in I&s;rael.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>The&s;e are the words of King David, when Abner fell by the hand of Joab. It was indeed at a critical moment, at the time when the hou&s;e of Saul and
<PB N="6" REF="036848_0005_100B21BAE351DEC0">
the hou&s;e of David were to be united. And happy it is, when contending na|tions come to this ble&s;&s;ed period, that they will no longer bath their &s;words in human blood, but be united in love, and agree to have one King to rule over them; and that is Chri&s;t, the King of Kings. David &s;eemed much troubled for Abner, for he &s;aid to his &s;ervants, <HI>Know ye not that a Prince and a great Man is fallen in I&s;rael</HI>&mdash;As if he had &s;aid, do you know, are you &s;en&s;ible of the lo&s;s of &s;uch a man at this time, a time of trouble, and great changes taking place. It is &s;aid, that David and the people wept over Abner. But my dear friends and fellow citizens; may I not &s;ay, know ye not that there is a Prince and a great Man fallen&mdash;Know ye not, ye Sons of America and of tho&s;e nations who are involved in war, and &s;taining the field with human blood, that WASHING|TON the Great is fallen; but not by the hands of a Traitor as Abner fell, but by the hands of a kind Providence. He that in mercy gave him to his Country, has taken him from us; and it ought to be the language of every Chri&s;tian, the
<PB N="7" REF="036848_0006_100B21BD087F4718">
Lord gave and the Lord has taken away, and ble&s;&s;ed be the name of the Lord. It is our duty to ble&s;s the everla&s;ting God, that he has &s;pared him &s;o long in the Land of the living. But it is only the grace of God that can enable us to glo|rify him at <HI>all</HI> times. It may ju&s;tly be &s;aid that a Prince and a great Man is fallen. In the fir&s;t place it will be nece&s;&s;ary to no|tice the Appellation that is given in the Text, in the &s;cripture &s;en&s;e of the words, namely <HI>a Prince and a great Man,</HI> and &s;ee how far the&s;e words agree with the pre&s;ent &s;olemn occa&s;ion&mdash;The fir&s;t of the&s;e that comes under our con&s;ideration is the appellation of a <HI>Prince.</HI> It is well known, that it is a title of honour given to the Son of a King, a Sovereign or a Chief Ruler&mdash;but &s;ome of my hearers may &s;ay, <HI>that</HI> was never given to our late General. Now I grant it was not. According to our Con&s;titution, titles are done away. Yet is it not plain to every under&s;tanding, that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed tho&s;e &s;ublime qualifi|cations, which ju&s;tly merit the title of a Prince. My friends, were they not like the Sun, giving Light and heat, and di&s;|per&s;ing the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> and bringing great
<PB N="8" REF="036848_0007_100B21C0B32C20D0">
things to light? But this title is not only given to King's Sons, but to God the Governor of the world, and likewi&s;e to Chri&s;t, the Saviour of Mankind. It is &s;aid I&s;aiah Chapt. 9, vers 6, "For unto us a Child is born&mdash;Unto us a Son is given, and the governement &s;hall be upon his &s;houlders, and his name &s;hall be cal|led the wonderful Coun&s;ellor, the mighty God, the everla&s;ting Father, the <HI>Prince</HI> of peace." He may well be called the Prince of peace, for it is through him and by him that we have Peace of Soul now, and Everla&s;ting peace in the world to come&mdash;and it is <HI>&s;uch</HI> that the world can neither give nor take away&mdash;Sweet peace he gives to that Soul, that is weeping and longing for his pre&s;ence, and is willing to become a true and a faithful Subject to the Prince of peace. Ble&s;&s;ed be God, this was Chri&s;t's Legacy, which he left to all his followers to the end of time, John, Chap. 14, v. 27. "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you, not as the world giveth, give I unto you, let not your heart be troubled. Neither let it be afraid." And as Prince he gives peace to his &s;ubjects, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> mighty Prince
<PB N="9" REF="036848_0008_100B21C2D7EA2970">
he maintains that Peace as in the ca&s;e of the children of I&s;rael, when Pharaoh pur&s;ued them, Exodus Chap. 14, v. 28. "And the waters returned and covered the chariots, and the hor&s;emen, and all the ho&s;t of Pharaoh, that came into the Sea after them, there remained not &s;o much as one of them." The Lord in all ages has appeared in their behalf. "The Stars in their cour&s;es &s;hall fight for I&s;|rael." Or does he countermand nature in any of its motions, and bid the Sun &s;tand &s;till in Gibeon, and the Moon in the val|ley of Ajalon, it is that the armies of his people may have long Daylight, to &s;ub|due their enemies. Hail&s;tone and Thun|der &s;hall break out of the clouds, to de|&s;troy the Cananites, when I&s;rael is at war with them. But if I&s;rael wants bread in the wilderne&s;s the clouds &s;hall drop down Manna, and give them bread from heaven. And how did the Lord appear for Peter, when he was kept in pri&s;on, Act, Chap. 12, v. 7. "And behold the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light &s;hined in the pri&s;on, and he &s;mote Peter on the &s;ide and rai&s;ed him up, &s;aying, ari&s;e up quickly, And his chains fell off
<PB N="10" REF="036848_0009_100B21C511E56BC0">
from his hands." Here you &s;ee Peter is bound, the angel unties him, he knows not where he is, the angel goes before him and guides him. In Revelation, Chap. 1 &amp; 5. Je&s;us Chri&s;t is &s;tyled "the faithful witne&s;s, and the fir&s;t begotten of the dead, and the Prince of the Kings of the Earth." As a Prince and a King he has a right to give laws and rule over his Subjects. Their dependance is upon him, from whom they receive their power and government, their protection and domi|nion. But more e&s;pecially are his people, indebted to him&mdash;for he leads them from victory to victory until he brings them to that Kingdom of Glory, that &s;hall never end. His power as a King is great, for none dare &s;ay unto him, what doeth thou&mdash;he can turn the children of men into du&s;t, and bring down the mighty from their Seats&mdash;and who can &s;tay his hand? The Kings and Princes of this world have great power over their &s;ubjects. Many of them wantonly &s;pil the blood of their people, and lay many heavy burdens upon them. But let them remember, they mu&s;t appear before the mighty Prince, and an&s;wer for
<PB N="11" REF="036848_0010_100B21C698CD51C8">
their conduct. And as it is common for the Kings and the Princes of this world, to puni&s;h tho&s;e that rebel again&s;t them; &s;o will the Judge of all the Earth puni&s;h tho&s;e who de&s;pi&s;e his Council and his reproof, e&s;pecially every open and profane &s;inner. And as Paul tells us&mdash;Titus Chap. 1. 16. "They profe&s;s that they know God, but in works they deny him, being abominable and di&s;obedient, and unto every good work reprobates." There are no &s;ort of per&s;ons &s;o odious to God, and &s;o abominable in his &s;ight, as tho&s;e who make a profe&s;&s;ion of his holy name and truth, but walk contrary in their lives to that profe&s;&s;ion. And in ge|neral, tho&s;e that profe&s;s to love their Prince and prove Traitors, are &s;everely puni&s;hed&mdash;and of &s;uch St. Paul is &s;peak|ing; and I fear there are too many in this our day.</P>
<P>But in order that we may know them, let us &s;ee if we cannot di&s;cover them in 2 Tim. Chap. 3, vers 4 &amp; 5: "Traitors, heady, highminded lovers of plea&s;ures more than lovers of God; having a form of Godline&s;s, but denying the power thereof&mdash;from &s;uch turn away." Is not
<PB N="12" REF="036848_0011_100B21C8348C8B90">
this the ca&s;e with many, who deny the power of God, and the love of God in the &s;oul; and po&s;itively declare, that there is no &s;uch thing as knowing that Sin is forgiven, and the Spirit of God bearing witne&s;s in men that they are the children of God&mdash;"From &s;uch turn away," for they are robbers of Chri&s;t, and di&s;honour him in the greate&s;t degree&mdash;and yet they will go to the table of the Lord; And like Judas betray the Son of Men. But remember that he will appear as a mighty Prince to the utter de&s;olation of all his enemies, as it is written in The&s;&s;a|lonians Chap. 1, v. 8 &amp; 9. He will come "in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them, that know not God, and that obey not the Go&s;pel of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who &s;hall be puni&s;hed with everla&s;ting de&s;truction from the pre&s;ence of the Lord and from the Glory of his Power." Remember what he decleared concern|ing the Jews and Jeru&s;alem, and that the prophecies came to pa&s;s. We are told by "Jo&s;ephus, fearful &s;ights and great things were &s;een, a Star in a &s;hape like a &s;word, hanging over Jeru&s;alem for a long time together&mdash;Armies fighting in
<PB N="13" REF="036848_0012_100B21CB964F74D0">
the clouds, and what he reckons wor&s;e than all, the extraordinary conduct of one Je&s;us, an apparent Lunatic, who for more then &s;even years went about the city, proclaiming, woe to Jeru&s;alem? woe to the city, and to the temple and to the people, and could by no means be re&s;trained."</P>
<P>The Supreme Judge and Prince of the Kings of the earth did not let the bar|barous conduct of the Jews go unpuni&s;hed. The mo&s;t &s;ignal marks of divine Ju&s;tice pur&s;ued them. We are informed by Dr. Mo&s;heim's Church hi&s;tory, Vol 1. p. 323: "As indulgence was given by Julian for the Jews to rebuild the temble of Jeru|&s;alem, they &s;et about it, from which how|ever they were obliged to de&s;i&s;t before they had even began to lay the foundation of the &s;acred edifice. For while they were removing the rubbi&s;h, formidable balls of fire, i&s;&s;uing out of the ground with a dreadful noi&s;e, di&s;per&s;ed both the works and the workmen, and repeated earthquakes filled the &s;pectators of this a&s;toni&s;hing phenomenon, with terror and di&s;may. This &s;ignal event is atte&s;ted in a manner that renders its evidence irre|&s;i&s;table
<PB N="14" REF="036848_0013_100B21CD19E1D2F0">
"God will not be mocked." Call to your minds the&s;e words in the Revelation Chap. 6, v. 15&mdash;And the Kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every free men, hid them&s;elves in tde dens, and in the rocks of the mountains." When Chri&s;t will ap|pear an angry Lamb, the great ones in the world will fall before him; tho&s;e that do not comply with the heavenly Prince, &s;hall feel his wrath. Where my Fellow Citizens, where can you go from his pre|&s;ence,&mdash;none but Je&s;us can do helple&s;s Sinners good&mdash;
<Q><LG>
<L>Sinners turn, why will ye die?</L>
<L>God your maker a&s;ks you, Why?</L>
<L>God, who did your being give</L>
<L>Made you with him&s;elf to live.</L>
</LG></Q></P>
<P>But the Appellation, is given to the Church of Chri&s;t&mdash;they are called Princes, in Samuel 2 Chapt. 8th vers. "He rai&s;eth up the poor out of the du&s;t, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to &s;et them among <HI>Princes,</HI> and to make them inherit the throne of glory, for the pil|lars
<PB N="15" REF="036848_0014_100B21CEA167C9D0">
of the Earth are the Lords, and he hath &s;et the world upon them." But &s;ome of my hearers may &s;ay, are they &s;o by nature? I an&s;wer&mdash;NO, they were children of wrath as others, born in &s;in and brought forth in iniquity, as the A|po&s;tle tells us of &s;ome who had been guilty of great crimes&mdash;1 Cor. Chap. 6, vers 11. "And &s;uch were &s;ome of you, but ye are wa&s;hed, but ye are &s;anctified, but ye are ju&s;tifyed in the name of the Lord Je&s;us, and by the Spirit of our God." Thanks be to God, tho&s;e who are of a princely nature, are changed by the Grace of God; that grace that enab|les them to pre&s;s forward to that heaven|ly Prize. They know that this is not their re&s;ting place, for their Prince and King has a better country for them&mdash;they have a building with God, not made with hands, they can &s;weetly &s;ing:
<Q><LG>
<L>Theer is my hou&s;e and portion, for</L>

It is natural to think that the fol|lowers of Chri&s;t will &s;trive to be like him; for he &s;ays: Learn of my, for I am meek and lowly of heart. It is their wi&s;h and de&s;ire, that their &s;ouls &s;hould be happy here and glorious hereafter. Remember what the Apo&s;tle &s;aith: Tho&s;e that are born after the Spirit, do mind the things of the &s;pirit&mdash;and the &s;ame Spirit purifyeth their Souls by faith in Chri&s;t, and longing for a growth in grace, &s;uch as Love, Peace, long-&s;uffering, gentlene&s;s, good faith, meekne&s;s. The&s;e are the beautiful ornaments the Chri&s;tian de&s;ires to wear. The King doth greatly de&s;ire thy beauty, and holine&s;s of heart. They are born for a noble end. It ts common for the Sons of Kings to wear co&s;tly garments&mdash;&s;o do the Princes of God&mdash;they are clothed with a co&s;tly garment, not of their own making, No, that will not cover them.</P>
<LG>
<L>Thy Righteou&s;ne&s;s wearing,</L>

by Satan, and meanly thought of by the wicked and the ungodly&mdash;It will be but a little while, and when Chri&s;t &s;hall ap|pear they &s;hall be like him. Yet they are princes and &s;hall wear the glorious garment, P&s;alm 45, v, 13, 14, 15. "The Kings Daughter is all glorious within, her clothing is of wrought Gold, &s;he &s;hall be brought unto the King in Remnants of Neadle Work&mdash;the virgins, her compa|nions, that follow her, &s;hall be brought into thee, with gladne&s;s and rejoicing &s;hall they be brought, they &s;hall enter unto the Kings Palace." Let the fol|lowers of Chri&s;t rejoice, for it will not be long until they &s;hall enter into his glory. The Sons of Kings have a great many attendants and &s;o have the Princes of Chri&s;t, for all is yours for God is yours. Are not angels mini&s;tering &s;pirits, &s;ent forth to mini&s;ter for them who &s;hall be heirs of &s;alvation; Tho&s;e glorious &s;pi|rits are their attendants in life and in death,&mdash;they convoy them to the re|gions of light. And what is be&s;t, they have God&mdash;"Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men of I&s;rael, for I am with you." Happy People! When the Prince of

But as they are Princes, they are entitled to a crown, and a kingdom&mdash;In the Revelations, Chap. 1, v. 6 "And he hath made us Kings and Prie&s;ts unto God&mdash;And his father, to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever, Amen." Their king|dom is an everla&s;ting kingdom.</P>

</LG>
<P>They reign as Kings, not in a tem|poral but in a &s;piritual &s;en&s;e, they reign as Kings over unruly lu&s;ts and corrup|tions, over Satan, over the world, over death, the King of terrors&mdash;They reign upon earth, without which it is impo&s;&s;ible to triumph in heaven&mdash;when the Chri&s;tian has fini&s;hed his cour&s;e with patience and per&s;everance&mdash;"he &s;hall wear the Crown of Life."</P>
<P>Earthly Princes have great power&mdash;and &s;o have the Princes of God&mdash;It is &s;aid of Abraham "thou art a mighty Prince

among us." Great is their power with God. When the Lord was going to de&s;troy So|dom, Gen. Ch. 19, v. 22, he &s;aid to Lott, Ha&s;te thee, e&s;cape thither, for I can not do any thing till thou become thither." And Abraham plead with the Lord for that very city&mdash;I realy believe if it were not for the Princes of God, there would &s;oon be an end to this world; they often plead with God in mighty prayers. The Angel that wre&s;tled with Jacob, &s;aid: "Thy name &s;hall be called no more Jacob, but I&s;rael, for as a Prince ha&s;t thou power with God and with man, and ha&s;t prevailed." I pray God, that there were more wre&s;tling Jacobs, that the Lord would revive his work in this our day, that there might be an ingathering to his king|dom&mdash;There &s;hould we meet, where the wicked cea&s;e from troubling, and the weary are at re&s;t. I can not yet leave this head, without admiring the patience of the ble&s;&s;ed God, and King of Kings, who, tho' &s;o &s;trong and powerful, yet is provoked every day.&mdash;Surely as is his maje&s;ty, &s;o is his mercy. If I villify but the name of a monarch, I lo&s;e my liberty and am confined to the dungeon or

&s;lavery. If I appear in arms and draw the &s;word again&s;t my national &s;overeign, my life is forfeited, and my very blood will &s;carcely atone for the crime. But have we not all di&s;honoured thee O thou King, immortal and invi&s;ible&mdash;happy are they that are under the &s;hadow of his wings&mdash;But wo unto his enemies!
