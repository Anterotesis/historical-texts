<P>DAVID, after he had &s;erved his own generation, fell on &s;leep, and was laid unto his fathers, and &s;aw corruption.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE words of St. PAUL, afford us a com|pendious view of DAVID's life and death:&mdash;but you will not expect me to trace the foo&s;teps of this great character from the &s;heepfold to his exit. The inci|dents of his life are too numerous and complicate to admit the attempt.&mdash;The &s;etting &s;un would leave the narration unfini&s;hed. A few ob&s;ervations, therefore, con&s;i&s;tent with the text, mu&s;t &s;uffice</P>
<P>LET it be ob&s;erved, that DAVID <HI>&s;erved</HI> his own generation. By this it is apparent, that he was po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed of a generous, a noble &s;oul.&mdash;Unlike tho&s;e, who fondly &s;tyle them&s;elves exclu&s;ive patriots at the pre|&s;ent day, he proved by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of great actions, that "&s;elf love and &s;ocial are the &s;ame." As a king, the welfare of his &s;ubjects was the main-&s;pring of his movements; as a good man, the love of GOD.&mdash;Al|though the greate&s;t in I&s;rael, he became "a &s;ervant to them all."</P>
<P>HE was active as light in oppo&s;ing their enemies, courageous in defending their rights, and &s;incere in
<PB REF="037200_0004_100D3A7B2146B128">
his joy, when their happine&s;s was the re&s;ult of his ex|ertions. His conduct was always preci&s;ely accom|modated to the exigencies of the times.</P>
<P>AS the &s;oul of the body politic, he felt him&s;elf un|der the &s;tronge&s;t obligations to give it animation and vigor.&mdash;Hence that amazing application of all his fa|culties to the encouragement of his &s;ubjects, in any new and hazardous enterprize, which is &s;o evident in every page of his hi&s;tory. In battle he often oppo&s;ed him&s;elf to the fir&s;t on&s;et of his enemies.&mdash;He di&s;dain|ed the idea of fending his troops on a forlorn hope, while he him&s;elf was &s;afe;&mdash;witne&s;s his words to them when they were ju&s;t going out to quell the rebels under ABSALOM;&mdash;"I will &s;urely go forth with you my&s;elf al&s;o."&mdash;Witne&s;s the an&s;wer of the people, who well knew his generous &s;oul would have urged him to &s;hare all their dangers:&mdash;"Thou &s;hall not go forth; for if <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us; but now thou art worth ten thou&s;and of us; now, therefore, it is bet|ter that thou &s;uccour us out of the city."&mdash;Witne&s;s his refu&s;ing to drink the water, which three of his mighty men had brought him from the well in Bethlehem, after pu&s;hing them&s;elves through a ho&s;t of Phili&s;tines in order to obtain it.&mdash;He had been longing for it; but a recollection of the dangers, to which his faithful &s;ervants had expo&s;ed them&s;elves, prevented him from &s;laking his thir&s;t.&mdash;His feelings were too &s;trong to be
<PB N="7" REF="037200_0005_100D3A7E0544BD58">
expre&s;&s;ed but by pouring it on the ground.&mdash;"Be it far from me, O Lord, that I &s;hould do this.&mdash;Is not this the blood of the men who went in jeopardy of their lives?"</P>
<P>WHAT but the blacke&s;t ingratitude could dictate a revolt from &s;uch a king?&mdash;What, but a heart, hard as the nether mill-&s;tone could withhold its love?&mdash;What but a total extinction of humanity, could have promp|ted an ABSALOM to turn his arms again&s;t the be&s;t of fathers?&mdash;To what exce&s;s of grief mu&s;t &s;uch unnatur|al conduct have reduced an indulgent parent? Grief did not, however, divert his mind from his darling object, the felicity of his &s;ubjects. So &s;teady is virtue, when the handmaid to knowledge.</P>
<P>THE good king was well apprized of the horrors of anarchy, and could duly appreciate the ble&s;&s;ings of peace and regularity. Let rulers aim at the intere&s;ts of their &s;ubjects and con&s;tituents, and they will &s;ecure their own. Were they con&s;cientiou&s;ly to exchange one word in their political dictionary for another; or rather, would they con&s;ider the word <HI>Rule,</HI> as an ab|breviation of the word <HI>Service,</HI> the people would not &s;o often cen&s;ure their diction, nor criminate their con|duct. "DAVID <HI>&s;erved</HI> his own generation."</P>
<P>THIS is true of him in many re&s;pects. He not on|ly led them to frequent victory over their enemies, and the enemies of God&mdash;laid &s;everal nations under
<PB N="8" REF="037200_0006_100D3A7FCB104A68">
tribute&mdash;increa&s;ed his revenues&mdash;lightened the bur|dens of his &s;ubjects, and pre&s;erved order at home;&mdash; but he adju&s;ted the affairs of his kingdom, both civil and military in the mo&s;t beneficial manner po&s;&s;ible.&mdash; He ordered a &s;tanding militia, con&s;i&s;ting of 288,000 men, to &s;erve alternately in a body of 24,000 each month. In addition to all this, he frequently incul|cated on the minds of his people the fir&s;t principles of religion, and did, indeed, write much for their in&s;truc|tion.</P>
<P>JUST before he died he left a model of the Temple, which was afterwards built by SOLOMON; and &s;hone as the brighte&s;t ornament of that nation. It is &s;aid, that he had re&s;erved 46,000 tons of gold, and many other materials, ama&s;&s;ed by conque&s;t, and laid a&s;ide by the hand of a rigorous economy, for the building of that ma&s;ter-piece of architecture.</P>
<P>IN <HI>all</HI> the&s;e articles he &s;erved his own genera|tion; in the <HI>la&s;t,</HI> his &s;ervice looked beyond the then pre&s;ent people. Let it not be unnoticed in the re|cords of his hi&s;tory, that he "acted by the will of God." Providence rai&s;ed him up and qualified him for the important &s;tation on which he reflected &s;o much honor. It was the will of heaven, that he &s;hould reign over I&s;rael, and "the in&s;piration of the Almigh|ty gave him an under&s;tanding" proper to direct him in the di&s;charge of the arduous duties attached to Roy|alty. Infinite wi&s;dom will not &s;end one of his &s;er|vants
<PB N="9" REF="037200_0007_100D3A8169E259E0">
into a field of difficulties, and not arm him a|gain&s;t them. He will not &s;uffer a poor, dependant creature to fight the battles of the Lord at his own charges. If "by him kings reign, and princes de|cree ju&s;tice," by him al&s;o they are endowed with quali|fications adapted to their offices.</P>
<P>IF "by the will of God" be meant <HI>according</HI> to that will, then DAVID may be &s;aid to have faithfully &s;erved GOD by &s;erving his generation. There is no doubt of the fact. He is denominated a &s;ervant of GOD through a great part of the old Scriptures. He was eminently &s;uch. It &s;hould be the great aim of all rulers to di&s;cover the mind of GOD, and to make it the grand criterion of all their admini&s;trations. Were this univer&s;ally the ca&s;e, the ruled would univer&s;ally rejoice. All tho&s;e mi&s;erable jealou&s;ies, which di&s;turb the peace and mar the happine&s;s of civil &s;ociety, would want a name. Nay, I know not, in &s;uch an event, whether &s;ubjects would not rather move in their own humble &s;phere, than take the pious cares and anxieties off their &s;houlders who hold the reigns of government. The highe&s;t di&s;tinction between a godly ruler and his con&s;tituents, is, that HE &s;upports the heavie&s;t burthen. Unenvied po&s;t of honor in the view of every con&s;ider|ate mind! MOSES bitterly complained of the cares impo&s;ed on him. He found it difficult indeed to car|ry in his arms a whole people, as a father carrieth his children.&mdash;He felt as a father to them; but they were
<PB N="10" REF="037200_0008_100D3A83A2CB7C68">
too numerous for the attention of a &s;ingle man. The cares of public life are great a&s;&s;i&s;tants to time in &s;end|ing man to his long home. "DAVID fell on &s;leep and was laid unto his fathers."</P>
<P>IT would be trite here to ob&s;erve, that death pays no re&s;pect to per&s;ons; that kings and pea&s;ants mu&s;t lie down in the grave together; or that titles, di&s;tinc|tions and honors form no barrier again&s;t the great leveller of life. We would only take notice, that death is called a &s;leep, and ob&s;erve, that to him who has la|bored &s;trenuou&s;ly in the &s;ervice of GOD and his gene|ration, this "&s;leep is &s;weet." To throw off all our mortal habiliments at the clo&s;e of our days mu&s;t be plea&s;ant, if we have worn them u&s;efully. They are peculiarly cumber&s;ome to <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Rulers</HI>; they therefore, mu&s;t find <HI>peculiar</HI> &s;atisfaction in being "un|clothed," e&s;pecially, if they have good rea&s;on to hope for the garment "of immortality."&mdash;They may then exult in the cheering idea of exchanging corruption for incorruption; of laying down an earthly diadem, and taking up a crown of glory. If for a time they &s;ee corruption in their bodies, their &s;pirits wear a bright|er form beyond its corroding power.&mdash;If they &s;leep awhile, they are &s;ure to be awakened to &s;ee with infinite &s;atisfaction "the morning of the re&s;urrection."</P>
<P>THIS is all applicable to DAVID. Nor is it le&s;s &s;o to the illu&s;trious WASHINGTON;&mdash;"the fir&s;t in <HI>war,</HI> the fir&s;t in <HI>peace,</HI> and the fir&s;t in the hearts of a great people."</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="037200_0009_100D3A872718C618">To give you his ju&s;t character, would be to partake in &s;ome mea&s;ure of its glory&mdash;an honor to which I dare not a&s;pire. To &s;ay that he was born Feb. 11th O. S. 1732, became commander in chief of the armies of America in 1775&mdash;that he re&s;igned that important, but well di&s;|charged tru&s;t in 1783&mdash;was unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en Pre&s;i|dent of the United States of America in 1789&mdash;re|&s;igned the Pre&s;idency in 1796&mdash;accepted the command of the armies of the United States again in 1798&mdash;and that he died December 14th 1799, would be to re|peat what you have long &s;ince heard. Farther &s;till would it be from propriety to follow him through the field of carnage, and fix the dates of his battles and his &s;ucce&s;&s;es. Suffer me, however, to &s;ketch &s;ome few traits in his military, civil, and dome&s;tic character.</P>
<P>HE began early to "&s;erve his generation by the will of GOD." His dawn was brilliant, and if not warm and influential, it waited only for time to throw his fellow-men beneath his more vertical rays.&mdash;Nor were they long in waiting&mdash;the &s;tory of a BRADDOCK will &s;anction the ob&s;ervation. In that we may &s;ee his &s;a|lutary coun&s;el fatally di&s;regarded, to the diminution of that haughty Briton's fame. There al&s;o may be view|ed the bud of warlike promi&s;e opening at the fir&s;t ge|nial touch of occa&s;ion. There we might have di&s;|cerned, with no prophetic eye, the wreaths of honor, which time was weaving for our youthful hero. The era, de&s;tined for the full di&s;play of them, was not
<PB N="12" REF="037200_0010_100D2E5805F37BB8">
known. The eye of a JACOB might, however, have pierced through future years, and led him to predict the &s;ame things of our national deliverer, in &s;ome re&s;|pects, as of JUDAH.&mdash;"JUDAH is a lion's whelp, gone up from the prey." He might have de&s;cribed him af|terwards as a "lion Couchant, not Rampant"&mdash;as one who did not love war for its own &s;ake, but who fought for peace, that he might enjoy without mole&s;tation, what his &s;trength and courage had fairly won.</P>
<P>THIS character was completely exhibited by the man, the warrior, who&s;e removal we now lament.&mdash; That ambition, which, by its madne&s;s and cruelty con|demns many of its votaries to "everla&s;ting fame," found no place in his capacious mind. He fought for the birthright of his countrymen, <HI>Liberty.</HI>&mdash;He &s;truggled again&s;t a powerful, and a haughty foe, who was determined to wre&s;t from us that invaluable gift of heaven. The hidden lightning of his &s;pirit fla&s;hed in the face of an oppo&s;ing cloud, but could never pro|mote an equilibrium. The balance was in his favor. Victory marched by his &s;ide in the cau&s;e divine, and thus became worthy of her name. Apparent inaction in HIM was &s;ometimes of actions the greate&s;t. It has been well ob&s;erved of him, that his delay was conque&s;t. His policy was truly FABIAN, and therefore the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible for his country, raw and undi&s;ciplined as were its troops. He well knew that "tide in human af|fairs, which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune."&mdash;
<PB N="13" REF="037200_0011_100D3A8A6AA6D6A8">
That tide began to flow, when war with an imperious aggre&s;&s;or fir&s;t dre&s;&s;ed our hero in a &s;uit of freedom, and bade him repre&s;ent the nation. He wore it with in|vincible firmne&s;s and unalterable dignity, till he could pre&s;ent each of his fellow-countrymen with the &s;ame glorious robe. Having &s;ecured the grand object of his exertions, he retired from the tented field to his be|loved Mount, richly laden with the evergreens of fame, there to drink the pure breath of peace, there to in|dulge a highly dignified lei&s;ure.&mdash;This boon he was not long to enjoy.</P>
<P>As he had de&s;cended from the greate&s;t circle ever de&s;cribed by one luminary in the atmo&s;phere of man, &s;o the mere voluntary twilight of his radience &s;till held the admiring eye of the nation.</P>
<P>HIS country &s;oon again demanded in the language of humble nece&s;&s;ity, the full blaze of his genius. Oc|ca&s;ion kindled his benevolent &s;pirit, and he maje&s;tical|ly an&s;wered the demand.</P>
<P>THE old confederation upon a &s;light &s;urvey was found totally inadequate to the purpo&s;es of maintaining har|mony and order, or of concentrating the intere&s;ts of the American States. The experience and di&s;cernment of a WASHINGTON, were importunately reque&s;ted and freely granted. In the fabrication of the Con&s;titution under which we now live, he was a prime agent.&mdash;His penetration was the tele&s;cope, through which an augu&s;t
<PB N="14" REF="037200_0012_100D3A8E96580820">
body of State&s;men and Patriots deigned to look for the remote&s;t con&s;equences of its articles. No wonder, then, that he was embraced by the nation at large in the choice of a Pre&s;ident.</P>
<P>THE firmne&s;s, the dignity, the enlightened pa|trioti&s;m, which he exhibited in the di&s;charge of his weighty Pre&s;idential duties, have been &s;o thoroughly experienced, as to leave our encomiums in the rear of his worth. He was the central fixed &s;tar in the politi|cal &s;phere, around which revolved many bright, though inferior lights. In him were united both the powers of attraction and repul&s;ion. His dignity &s;uffered none of his train rudely to approximate within the line of decent di&s;tance; while his alluring excellence drew them into the focus of his benignity. Whoever once &s;aw his mere exterior mu&s;t have wi&s;hed to unlock the ca&s;ket which contained a brilliant of the fir&s;t water.&mdash; Vain, however, is an attempt fully to portray a cha|racter like his. We want tho&s;e &s;hades, by which we readily di&s;cern the &s;emblances of common men.&mdash; The cardinal virtues mu&s;t &s;it for their likene&s;&s;es, to give the world the great Contour of his moral coun|tenance; and virtues of a lower cla&s;s mu&s;t fill the re|mainder of the picture.</P>
<P>LET us not forget, that he was confe&s;&s;edly a &s;ol|dier of Chri&s;t, and as &s;uch "wre&s;tled not only again&s;t fle&s;h and blood, but again&s;t principalities and pow|ers,
<PB N="15" REF="037200_0013_100D3A9023151828">
and the rulers of the darkne&s;s of this world al&s;o. He took much of the "armour of God"&mdash;"His loins were girt about with truth, and his brea&s;t-plate was righteou&s;ne&s;s."&mdash;"His feet were &s;hod with the pre|paration of the go&s;pel of peace," and this rendered his journey through a thorny world more &s;afe and ea&s;y. <HI>Faith</HI> was his <HI>&s;hield</HI> and the hope of &s;avation his <HI>hel|met.</HI> Thus he was enabled "to quench the fiery darts of the wicked, and having done all, to &s;tand."</P>
<P>AFTER having ornamented, yea, highly dignified the Cabinet, put faction to the blu&s;h, laid his cool hand on the di&s;tracted pul&s;e of anarchy and rebellion, and reduced it to the moderate vibration of health, he once more nobly relinqui&s;hed his glorious &s;tation, and returned to his beloved Vernon, to di&s;charge the du|ties and ta&s;te the plea&s;ures of private, dome&s;tic life.&mdash; Here he was the kind hu&s;band, the feeling ma&s;ter, and the benevolent neighbor.&mdash;Like the worthies of the old Te&s;tament, he was Prophet, Prie&s;t, and King in his own family. With him &s;lavery forgot her chains, and his hou&s;ehold was peace and love. The acme of his perfection however, was not fully attained, till he complied with the invitation once more to become the bulwark of his country.&mdash;Glorious &s;acrifice of the calm hours of the evening of life! Too exalted a conduct to admit a parallel!&mdash;When did the almond flouri&s;h with &s;uch ennobled beauty? Hi&s;tory is &s;ilent, and &s;ilent will remain, perhaps, forever.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="037200_0014_100D3A91B5A58540">IMPIOUS. France dared not to declare open ho&s;tili|ties, but &s;aid to her&s;elf the "old Lion is couched down, who &s;hall dare to rou&s;e him?"</P>
<P>HERE we pau&s;e!&mdash;Regret for his lo&s;s &s;ucceeds to the plea&s;ure of recounting the deeds of his important life!&mdash;Yet let us not cruelly wi&s;h his return, while we believe his Vernon was but a &s;tep-&s;tone to mount Zion.&mdash;Like Samp&s;on, he &s;lew more at his death, than in his life; &s;ince even the numerous children of Envy we laid a&s;leep. Envy her&s;elf &s;tops at his grave, and pronounces his eulogy.</P>
<P>WHILE we &s;incerely lament his departure, let us re|member that God, <HI>with whom is the re&s;idue</HI> of the &s;pirit, can qualify others to fill every important &s;ta|tion in the field and in the cabinet, and enable them to "&s;erve their generation according to his will." Let us pray that he would impart the &s;pirit of our much regretted friend to our worthy PRESIDENT, and make the &s;ubordinate officers in civil tru&s;t, as angels of God to this people. May we all be enabled to &s;erve <HI>our</HI> generation according to the will of heaven, that we may "be laid to our fathers in peace."</P>
