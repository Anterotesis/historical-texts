<Q><HI>KNOW YE NOT THAT A PRINCE AND A GREAT MAN IS FALLEN THIS DAY IN ISRAEL?</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE are the words of a mourner, who lamented the death of one not allied to him by the ties of blood; but a man of &s;hining talents and di&s;tingui&s;hed abilities, who&s;e &s;ervices were greatly needed at that time.</P>
<P>The mourner was David, King of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. The per&s;on who&s;e fall he lamented was Abner an offi|cer of the fir&s;t rank.</P>
<P>This Abner was captain of the ho&s;t, he had been general of Saul's army, was near the pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> of the King and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a large &s;hare of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> confi|dence and favor.</P>
<P>He was faithful to king Saul, during his reign,
<PB N="6" REF="038307_0004_10119E3E4ADEF198">
and zealou&s;ly &s;upported the intere&s;t of his family after his decea&s;e.</P>
<P>This man was not only in high favor with the King; but with the people <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">&punc; he had a large &s;hare of their confidence.</P>
<P>Some may think, perhaps, that Abner's for&s;a|king I&s;hbo&s;heth, Saul's &s;on, and throwing his in|fluence into the &s;cale of his rival, is a blot in his character. But Abner might find I&s;hbo&s;heth to be a haughty, jealous, if not an effeminate prince, and unfit to govern a kingdom, and for this rea&s;on, as al&s;o to &s;ave the blood of his country by uniting the contending parties, u&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> his influence to e&s;tabli&s;h the regal dignity in the hands of David.</P>
<P>But if this was any blemi&s;h in his character, the royal mourner did not take notice of it, or view it in that light.</P>
<P>But this I &s;hall leave, and attend to the eulogium in the text, a prince and a great man.</P>
<P>His being called a prince &s;eems to import that Abner was the chief, or head of a family in the tribe. This was a title of honor given to the head of the tribes of I&s;rael: they were princes of the congregation.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to have been an ancient as well as mod|ern cu&s;tom to give men in public offices an honor|ary title; &s;uch as was attached to their office.</P>
<P>But titles of honor are not always connected with a true greatne&s;s of character. King David &s;eems
<PB N="7" REF="038307_0005_10119E40B70C9B08">
to have been aware of this, and therefore mentions Abner, not only as an honorable per&s;onage, but as a great man.</P>
<P>It was the greatne&s;s of this man's character, which made him to be &s;o much lamented. He was po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of talents which were of importance to the State, and &s;uch as were wanted at that time.</P>
<P>There was no man &s;o well calculated to unite the tribes of I&s;rael, at that time divided, as was Abner. He was not only in high favor with David; but he had &s;uch influence with the tribes of I&s;rael, as to be able to incline them to any party, and engage them to &s;upport any intere&s;t he might be di&s;po&s;ed to favor.</P>
<P>With great ea&s;e he drew the ten tribes into his views of &s;upporting David whom God had cho&s;en, and anointed to be King over his people. His in|fluence with the people was &s;o great, as to bow the hearts of all ranks to the hou&s;e of David, which happily terminated a conte&s;t for the regal dignity, that was dangerous to the State. Thus the twelve tribes were united and became one band, invincible, to their enemies.</P>
<P>Thus the hands of David were &s;trengthened, and he was e&s;tabli&s;hed in the kingdom.</P>
<P>So much influence in a &s;ubject may be thought dangerous to the State: and influence &s;o exten&s;ive, employed again&s;t government, would throw all things into confu&s;ion, and might ruin a nation. But when &s;uperior talents added to influence &s;o ex|ten&s;ive as was Abner's, are directed by a generous,
<PB N="8" REF="038307_0006_10119E42452BE210">
patrioti&s;m, and employed for the &s;upport of gov|ernment, the mo&s;t plea&s;ing and happy effects are to be expected.</P>
<P>The active genius and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> talents of Ab|ner, were what made him appear great in the eyes of David.</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider the character of David, that he was a man of virtue, of an hone&s;t mind, yea, "a man after God's own heart," we are con&s;train|ed to believe he &s;poke what he thought was truth, when he announced Abner to have been a great man.</P>
<P>David was a man of too nice a &s;en&s;e of honor, and had too great a regard to truth, to a&s;cribe a greatne&s;s of character to a man whom he did not think worthy of it.</P>
<P>King David knew Abner: he had accompanied him in former wars&mdash;had been an eye witne&s;s of his conduct in the exalted rank of Captain of the ho&s;t, or General of the army&mdash;he had &s;een that he behaved him&s;elf wi&s;ely&mdash;that his plans were form|ed with judgment and executed with di&s;patch, that he was re&s;olute and per&s;evering in accompli&s;hing whatever he undertook, and was equal to the mo&s;t important enterpri&s;es, he was therefore con|vinced that Abner merited the eulogy in the text.</P>
<P>Abner having attached him&s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the intere&s;t of David, the latter had no doubt rai&s;ed expectations from his abilities and influence. He had rea&s;on to expect in that man a firm friend, and an able &s;up|porter of his government&mdash;that by his exertion
<PB N="9" REF="038307_0007_10119E45E21BA8B0">
his (David's) intere&s;t, which might have appeared doubtful, would be much &s;trengthened.</P>
<P>The addre&s;s and talents of Abner, were of &s;ignal advantage to the Kings. By the prudent coun&s;els, the engaging manners, and convincing argument of the former, the tribes of I&s;rael had been won over to the intere&s;t of the latter&punc; they had been made willing to acknowledge David to be their lawful King, and to follow his fortune.</P>
<P>Altho' Abner did not live to fini&s;h his great de|&s;ign of e&s;tabli&s;hing the kingdom in the hands of David; yet, the foundation was laid &s;o &s;trong, that the ever&punc; took place after his decea&s;e. The impre&s;&s;ion made on their minds by this influen|tial man, continued to direct the conduct of I&s;rael after his death; and the happy effect of his exer|tions, were experienced by the King, when Abner was no more.</P>
<P>The&s;e were no doubt among the con&s;iderations which gave ri&s;e to the mourning recorded in the text and context.</P>
<P>Whatever &s;ervices this man had rendered the King, and whatever he might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ect from his fu|ture exertions, his hopes were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> off by his death.</P>
<P>The King wept at his grave, he lamented his fall, and, to do ju&s;tice to his memory, pronounced him "a great man."</P>
<P>Mourning is decent and proper, when not indul|ged to exce&s;s. It is no mark of a weak mind, it betrays no want of religion. On the other hand,
<PB N="10" REF="038307_0008_10119E49452EC070">
it di&s;covers a &s;en&s;e of the dignity of human nature, and the di&s;honor done to man in the grave.</P>
<P>Mourning is a tribute due to the memory of the decea&s;ed, e&s;pecially to illu&s;trious characters.</P>
<P>It is proper to keep in mind their amiable virtues&mdash;to call into view the &s;hining traits in their cha|racters, and to make mention of their worthy deeds. This is doing them ju&s;tice, it is a tribute we owe them. This ju&s;tice was done to Abner, this tribute was paid to his memory in the words of the text, "a great man is fallen."</P>
<P>That &s;uch honor is due to the memory of the dead, &s;eems to be the &s;en&s;e of mankind. It is im|pre&s;&s;ed upon the minds of people of all ranks.</P>
<P>When David lamented the fall of his predece&s;|&s;or, and his &s;on, he did it in terms which expre&s;&s;ed whatever was prai&s;e-worthy in them. "Saul and Jonathan were lovely and plea&s;ant in their lives, they were &s;wifter than eagles, they were &s;tronger than lions." "Ye daughters of I&s;rael, weep over Saul, who clothed you in &s;carlet, with other de|lights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel."</P>
<P>When the good Hezekiah, King of Judah, kept with his fathers, it is &s;aid, that "they buried him in the chiefe&s;t of the &s;epulchers of the &s;ons of Da|vid; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jeru&s;a|lem did him honor at his death." They gave him an honorable burial, and lamented his fall with to|kens of grief for the lo&s;s of &s;o good a King.</P>
<P>Death in any form, cau&s;es mourning. Whoever
<PB N="11" REF="038307_0009_10119E4AD0078FB8">
the victim may be, it &s;preads a gloom upon the countenances of beholders.</P>
<P>We are not totally indifferent to the fall of any of our fellow creatures. Tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nconnected by the ties of blood or kindred, or the bonds of &s;ociety, their death makes a melancholly impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Death is a &s;tanding token of the divine di&s;plea|&s;ure at man's apo&s;tacy, and every in&s;tance of it pro|duces melancholly reflections in &s;urvivors.</P>
<P>This dreadful penalty, with which the divine law was &s;anctioned, is inflicted upon every age and de|&s;cription of man; the innocent babe of a day old, not excepted.</P>
<P>Death has laid his arre&s;t upon the young and old, the prince and pea&s;ant, the honorable and ig|noble: judges and rulers of the earth have undi&s;|tingui&s;hingly fallen a prey to the King of terrors. The&s;e are &s;ad reflections. In&s;tances of this nature cannot fail to create a degree of &s;orrow in the thinking part of mankind.</P>
<P>How natural it is to lament over a fallen fellow creature in a language &s;imilar <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that of the old prophet of Samaria. "Alas! my brother," friend, fellow citizen or benefactor.</P>
<P>Not only do the common ties of humanity call us to mourn over the dead; but a man's charac|ter, his exalted &s;tation in life, his di&s;tingui&s;hed a|bilities and exten&s;ive benevolence, one con&s;idera|tion which make his death to be univer&s;ally la|mented.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="038307_0010_10119E4E28A53A48">
When a man in a public &s;tation dies, his abili|ties, however great, of whatever utility and impor|tance they were, are forever lo&s;t to his fellow citi|zens, to his country and to the world. All expec|tations from his future exertions for the good of his fellow men are cut off. His opportunities to &s;erve his friends and his country, are at an end.</P>
<P>When a great and good man in a &s;tation of emi|nence falls the victim of death, his country feels the lo&s;s it &s;en&s;ibly effects the people at large, a whole nation (the &s;ons of Belial excepted) is troubled at his death, men of all ranks and every &s;tation, feel the public lo&s;s, and mourn, alas! our brother, our friend, our public father or illu&s;trious chief.</P>
<P>When Abner died, he was not only lamented by the King; but all the &s;ervants of David and the inhabitants of Judea wept: all felt the lo&s;s of &s;o great a man. It is moreover &s;aid, that all the I&s;|raelites were troubled at his death, which is a cir|cum&s;tance &s;hewing, that he was a man greatly be|loved.</P>
<P>The talents and virtues of great men are of al|mo&s;t infinite importance to every State or King|dom. Where th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e are not united in public lead|ing characters, government will grow corrupt and feeble, confu&s;ion and di&s;tre&s;s will triumph. If di&s;|tingui&s;hed abilities and exten&s;ive benevolence in public characters are not e&s;&s;ential to the being of a nation; yet are they nece&s;&s;ary to the well being of every community, great or &s;mall.</P>
<P>"Wo to thee O land, when thy King is a child" &s;aid Solomon. And wo to the &s;tate or nation
<PB N="13" REF="038307_0011_10119E5000254310">
who&s;e rulers and heads of departments are men of puerile characters, de&s;titute of tho&s;e talents which form the able &s;tate&s;man. Confu&s;ion and every evil may be expected.</P>
<P>On the other hand, happy is the nation who&s;e leading characters po&s;&s;e&s;s that a&s;&s;emblage of virtues and talents, which qualifies them for governing the &s;tate, who have wi&s;dom to di&s;cern what is for the good of their country, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to employ means for its welfare.</P>
<P>When men of di&s;tingui&s;hed abilities and virtuous integrity fill the Departments of State, the people experience the happy effects of their wi&s;e admini&s;|tration.</P>
<P>Such characters are among the greate&s;t national ble&s;&s;ings, whether they are placed in the cabinet or the field. Such &s;uperior talents directed by a vir|tuous patrioti&s;m, and the influence of &s;uch men ex|erted for the good of their country, produce the mo&s;t plea&s;ing and happy effects. Therefore, when a man of this de&s;cription dies, the people mourn. The words of the text may be applied, "a great man is fallen."</P>
<P>The death of great men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> like a frown of Heaven upon a people. As <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing up of able men to direct the civil or military affairs of a State is the doing of the Lord, and indicates his favorable regard to a people; &s;o, their removal by death, &s;eems to be a token of the divine di&s;plea|&s;ure, and &s;hews that he has a controver&s;y with that people. It therefore behoves a nation thus bereav|ed to mourn, and enquire with penitent hearts wherefore the Lord contendeth with them.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="038307_0012_10119E54E97484B0">
One man, in whom a di&s;cerning mind, &s;ound judgment, virtuous integrity, exten&s;ive influence and a generous patrioti&s;m are united and attached to a public &s;tation, is a great &s;upport to govern|ment, yea, he is one of the main props and pillars of the State; the good produced by his exertions is incalculable. Though the death of &s;uch a man may not be an irreparable lo&s;s, yet, it is a very great one. By his fall, the nation is bereaved of an able &s;tate&s;man, government is deprived of a great &s;upport: the people of a &s;teady friend and the &s;tate of a generous Benefactor. The cabinet is deprived of a wi&s;e Coun&s;ellor, or the Army of an able General, and the world of a valuable Citizen. One man of &s;uperior talents and di&s;tingui&s;hed vir|tues in the chair of State, is of more importance than many private per&s;ons. So thought the &s;er|vants of David, when they &s;aid to him as they were going out to battle again&s;t the rebellious Ab&s;alom, "thou art worth ten thou&s;and of us." And when "they &s;ware to him &s;aying thou &s;halt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the light of I&s;rael." As if the name and memory of I&s;rael mu&s;t die with their King.</P>
<P>Where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a rare a&s;&s;emblage of virtues and ta|lents, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> are happily united in one man, his life is of ine&s;timable worth to the nation: his death mu&s;t therefore be deeply regret|ted. Such my friends and fellow citizens, is the regret we feel this day. Great were the talents, di&s;tingui&s;hing the virtues of the man who&s;e death we bewail. By the late fall of a great and good man in the&s;e United States, our country is bereav|ed of a father, a valuable friend, an able &s;tate&s;man,
<PB N="15" REF="038307_0013_10119E5673E2E1F8">
and an accompli&s;hed general. Yea, mankind have lo&s;t a friend, and the world a beloved citizen.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON, the father of his country, the zealous defender of its rights and liberties is no more! the man of the people, "the delight of man|kind" is dead! the dignified patriot, the able &s;tate&s;man, the greate&s;t general the world could ever boa&s;t of, is fallen! the man who&s;e character does honor to human nature is gone from us to &s;eek a repo&s;e in the grave, from the toils of this mortal life. Could the words of the text ever be applied with more propriety than they are to that illu&s;|trious per&s;onage? an honorable per&s;on and a great man is fallen in our I&s;rael.</P>
<P>All the manly and amiable virtues which beau|tify the character and exalt the nature of man, &s;eem to have united them&s;elves in WASHING|TON, to make him the greate&s;t of men. He had a capacious mind; was a per&s;on of &s;ound judg|ment, deep penetration and quick di&s;cernment. He was decided in his mea&s;ures and conduct, inde|fatigable in accompli&s;hing what he undertook, and was equal to the mo&s;t important enterpri&s;es, civil or military&mdash;he was a man of &s;uperior abilities, and exten&s;ive influence. His mann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> were gentle, his deportment amiable, and his addre&s;s engaging, &s;teady and even in his temper, cool and collected in the mo&s;t trying &s;cenes of difficulty and danger. In war he was terrible to the invaders of his coun|try's rights: but was generous to his foes; hu|mane to tho&s;e whom the fortune of war threw into his hands, "the enemies them&s;elves being
<PB N="16" REF="038307_0014_10119E592903EC78">
judges." In peace and war he was an unwavering friend to the rights of ho&s;pitality: he held them to be &s;acred, he invaded them not, nor &s;uffered them to be infringed within the circle of his in|fluence. He was the inflexible patriot; he loved his country &s;incerely, and was the friend of man|kind.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON the great, had a good heart, and was attached to revealed religion.&mdash;His name &s;tands recorded among the profe&s;&s;ors of chri&s;tian|ity. He was not a&s;hamed to confe&s;s Chri&s;t and own him&s;elf to be a di&s;ciple of the crucified Je&s;us of Na|zareth. As he profe&s;&s;ed, &s;o he exemplified reli|gion. He vi&s;ited the a&s;&s;emblies of God's profe&s;&s;ing people, and joined with the wor&s;hippers of Jeho|vah in their religious devotions. This I view as the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing trait in his character&mdash;and that which reflects peculiar honor upon the man, in whatever capacity we view him.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON was truly the great man in the circle of dome&s;tic life; he was great in a poli|tical view, and great in a military capacity. His great and amiable virtues were carried into every &s;tation where God and his country placed him. His &s;uperior talents and great abilities were con|&s;tantly employed for the good of his fellow citi|zens in every public &s;tation he filled. His almo&s;t unbounded influence was invariably directed by a &s;incere love to his country&mdash;plea&s;ing and happy were the effects produced by his benevolent exer|tions.</P>
<P>De&s;igned by the Great Di&s;po&s;er of events to be an in&s;trument of good to his country, he was in|troduced
<PB N="17" REF="038307_0015_10119E5CF932DA50">
to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;y active &s;cenes, and even to the hardy deeds of war, at an early &s;tage of life.&mdash;Employed in his youth again&s;t an enemy, invading the frontiers of the ancient dominion of Virginia, he conducted the enterpri&s;e with that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and di&s;patch, which have characteri&s;ed the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in every &s;tage of his important life, to its clo&s;e.&mdash;His conduct in all that he undertook, held him to view as a man of active genius, and promi&s;ing talents.</P>
<P>When the drama of a revolutionary war, which gave liberty and independence to more than three millions of people, was opened on the plains of Lexington: WASHINGTON, as the mo&s;t &s;uitable per&s;on among the thou&s;ands of America, was ap|pointed commander in chief to direct the operations of war. With a diffidence which argued the great|ne&s;s of his mind, he accepted the important tru&s;t. Refu&s;ing every pecuniary reward for his &s;ervices as General of the American Armies, he put on the harne&s;s, he gra&s;p'd the &s;word and ha&s;tened to the &s;eat of war. The cordial benedictions and fervent prayers of thou&s;ands in our I&s;rael for his &s;afety and &s;ucce&s;s, followed him to the camp.</P>
<P>His conduct in the exalted rank of General of the army, through the fatigues, difficulties, and dangers of an eight years war, was &s;uch as would have done honor to the mo&s;t experienced General in the world. When that great man appeared at the head of our army, the eyes of America, and even of Europe were upon him. Thou&s;ands were tortured with anxiety for the event&mdash;the brea&s;t of our country was big with expectation. He more than an&s;wered the hopes of the mo&s;t &s;anguine&mdash;His conduct was
<PB N="18" REF="038307_0016_10119E5F687ECE58">
viewed with applau&s;e and admiration&mdash;He acquired tho&s;e honors in the field, which will never be ob|literated from the memory of his country&mdash;He ren|der<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> tho&s;e important, e&s;&s;ential &s;ervices, which, I hope&punc; will be gratefully remembered by millions, now unborn.</P>
<P>Through the whole &s;cene of that unhappy conte&s;t WASHINGTON remained the calm, but inflexible Patriot; the intrepid, humane General.</P>
<P>The war was at length conducted to a clo&s;e; long wi&s;hed for peace returned to ble&s;s our land.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON di&s;banded his army, re&s;igned his command, and quietly retired to the private walks of dome&s;tic life, to enjoy there the &s;weets of con&s;cious integrity, and the &s;elf approving reflec|tions of an untainted mind.</P>
<P>When the Federal Con&s;titution was to be organ|ized, WASHINGTON was elected Pre&s;ident of the United States by the unanimous &s;uffrages of his fel|low citizens. Eight years he filled the chair of &s;tate with peculiar dignity, and admini&s;tered the Con&s;titution with a fidelity which gave &s;atisfaction to every enlightened virtuous patriot in the United States. His &s;ublime virtues and exalted talents, &s;hone with equal lu&s;tre in the cabinet as in the field.</P>
<P>By the firm, decided conduct of this great man, order was maintained through the union. The efforts of a factious few, to mi&s;lead the public mind, create di&s;turbances in the State, and involve the nation in the horrors of an European war, were happily counteracted.</P>

A dangerous in&s;urrection rai&s;ed in the bowels of the State by the intrigues of an in&s;idious foreigner, was cru&s;hed in the beginning. The ho&s;tile natives of the de&s;ert were compelled to an honorable peace, and &s;ome unhappy differences exi&s;ting between the American Republic, and the Kingdom of Great Britain, were amicably adju&s;ted.</P>
<P>Having piloted the national bark through every &s;torm into &s;afe port, he re&s;igned the Chair of State, and returned to tho&s;e peaceful &s;cenes of dome&s;tic retirement, which he had reluctantly quitted in obedience to his country's call.</P>
<P>But his u&s;efulne&s;s did not end here, one illu&s;trious action more, remained to be added to the long li&s;t which had characteri&s;ed the man from early life. At the call of God and his country, he con&s;ented to jeopard his life again in the high places of the field. He accepted a military appointment to the com|mand of the army to be rai&s;ed in the United States, for their defence again&s;t any &s;udden inva&s;ion by the armies of France.</P>

in the office of Chief Magi&s;trate! it was a demon&s;tration of a great and noble mind! it reflects a di&s;tingui&s;hing lu&s;tre upon the life of that great man.</P>
<P>The name of WASHINGTON, General of the Armies of the United States, in&s;pired the &s;ons of freedom with a lively animation&mdash;and the veteran &s;oldier with an impetuous ardor.</P>
<P>While government was making preparation for the defence of the country, by rai&s;ing and officering an army, to be arranged and commanded by the greate&s;t General in the world; every mind was filled with expectation, and all were waiting the events which God and time would bring forth;&mdash;Death, who&s;e ravages are indi&s;criminate, laid his arre&s;ts upon our beloved Hero; General WASH|INGTON died. His great abilities, &s;ublime virtues and goodne&s;s of heart, could not exempt him from death, the common lot of humanity. He died as a man! as a common mortal! but he died as a good man; he left the world in peace. In the full exer|ci&s;e of his rea&s;on, and under &s;trong apprehen&s;ions of the time of his departure being come, he was calm, and entered the valley of the &s;hadow of death, with a &s;erenity of mind, which &s;eems to be peculiar to tho&s;e who have Heaven and the joys of the divine pre&s;ence in the pro&s;pect before them. We hope he is now enjoying the rewards of a well &s;pent life, that his death is infinite gain to him. But our lo&s;s is very great.</P>
<P>Though "the weapons of war, I tru&s;t, are not peri&s;hed," yet, true it is, "that the mighty is fallen." A man is fallen the victim of death who&s;e

abilities, influence and exertions were much want|ed at this juncture.</P>
<P>What &s;hall we &s;ay? that "the beauty of America is fallen? that the light of our I&s;rael is quenched?" Let us hope and pray that a double portion of the &s;pirit of WASHINGTON may re&s;t on his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>Lament for him we mu&s;t; he was "lovely and plea&s;ant in his life," he was our friend, he was the friend of our country and of mankind.</P>
<P>Weep over WASHINGTON, a man greatly be|loved, he jeoparded his life in the high places of the field, in defence of our invaded rights, and was an in&s;trument in the hand of providence of our deli|verence from the barbarous claims of de&s;poti&s;m, and the mean of our enjoying the &s;weets of liberty.</P>
<P>Americans, lament for your decea&s;ed General, who was the &s;courge of your country's foes. Be-wail the man, who, with the &s;word of magi&s;tracy, was a terror to evil doers, and a prai&s;e to them who did well.</P>
<P>Let all lament for the man who &s;ucce&s;sfully fought our battles, and under the au&s;pice of the God of armies gave to us the dear earned liberties we now enjoy. Weep for the man who guided the helm of State with unrivalled dignity&mdash;who ad|mini&s;tered the Con&s;titution of our country with undeviating ju&s;tice and integrity.</P>
<P>Daughters of America, "weep over WASHING|TON," who traver&s;ed the field of danger in your defence&mdash;who &s;ubmitted to the fatigues of a military

life, and encountered the dubious &s;torm of war to protect you, and the objects of your affection from the rapacity of a mercile&s;s foe; and who was an in&s;trument in the hands of God, of pre&s;erving to you and your deare&s;t connections all the plea&s;ant, delightful things in life.</P>
<P>Lament for him in the language of the Prophet, alas! our father, our friend, the in&s;trument of our political &s;alvation.</P>
<P>But while we all lament with deep regret the un|happy fall of that great and good man, let us offer united prai&s;es to the God of our fathers for his gift of Wa&s;hington to our country, and for his continuing a life of &s;o much importance to the&s;e States &s;o long; and let us gratefully remember the many and &s;ignal &s;ervices rendered us by him.</P>
<P>We may &s;ay in the words of the Queen of Sheba to Solomon, "ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord our God, who delighted in that man to place him at the head of our armies, and in the chair of State," becau&s;e the Lord loved us, he gave us WASHINGTON to pre|&s;ide in the field and in the cabinet.</P>
<P>General WASHINGTON was an exemplary man, let us copy his virtues and imitate his example. May Magi&s;trates po&s;&s;e&s;s a large &s;hare of the temper and &s;pirit con&s;picuous in him. May tho&s;e in po&s;ts of military honor, and every &s;oldier in the States, catch the "falling mantle" of their a&s;cending leader; imbibe his &s;pirit, and cultivate his virtues; be di|rected by the &s;ame &s;pirit, intrepidity, firmne&s;s, temperance and moderation, which embelli&s;hed his character.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="038307_0021_10119E6C073AD868">
Above all, let per&s;ons of all ranks and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;tation, honor the divine religion which he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.
