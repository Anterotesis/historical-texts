<HEAD>The <HI>MAJESTY</HI> and <HI>MORTALITY</HI> of created <HI>GODS.</HI></HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>THAT portion of Scripture which &s;hall lead our medita|tions, while we mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly participate in the general &s;orrow of our afflicted country, and pay our mournful tribute of re&s;pect to the departed Hero and Father of the American States, is written in the <Q><BIBL><HI>LXXXII PSALM, 6 and 7th ver&s;es.</HI></BIBL>
<P>I have &s;aid, Ye are Gods: and all of you are children of the Mo&s;t High. But ye &s;hall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.</P></Q></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>HOWEVER bright the &s;un may ri&s;e, however u&s;eful and cheering he may be in his meridian cour&s;e, yet, at the appointed hour, he will mo&s;t certainly &s;et. His cheer|ing light and genial influence will be withdrawn. In like manner men of the greate&s;t eminence, the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed by genius, by mental improvement, by exalted &s;tations and public u&s;efulne&s;s, to whatever degree they have illuminated, gladdened and benefited the &s;everal ages and nations in which they have flouri&s;hed, after a &s;hort and precarious day, have &s;et in the midnight gloom of death. Their u&s;efulne&s;s has &s;oon terminated, and they lie in the dark regions of the dead. Short is the whole term from the morning of life to the &s;ad evening of death. The author of our nature has made our days as an hand breadth and our age as nothing before him. The term of public life and u&s;efulne&s;s is &s;till much &s;horter. How &s;oon is the arm, which, with manly vigor &s;wayed the &s;ceptre, wielded the &s;word of ju&s;tice and of war, enervated with years? How &s;oon does the &s;tronge&s;t memory fail and the greate&s;t mental powers decline with age? Nay, how often are men of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed characters arre&s;ted by the hand of death, before the approach of old age? In the glory of life, in the mid&s;t of u&s;efulne&s;s they vani&s;h, like the vapor, and appear no more. They die &s;uddenly, die in every period of life and u&s;efulne&s;s, and by all the di&s;ea&s;es, ca&s;ualities and misfortunes by which other men die. They exhibit to the world the mo&s;t melancholy and &s;triking evi|dence, <HI>That every man at his be&s;t &s;tate is altogether vanity.</HI></P>
<P>OF this it is the de&s;ign of the text to admoni&s;h all men, and e&s;pecially all the great and honorable among them: That notwith&s;tanding the importance and elevation of their character they are mortal. The text indeed concedes, that &s;ome men are highly exalted above others. Magi&s;trates are called by the awful name of Gods, and all of them children

But to check human vanity, make them better men, and more exten&s;ively u&s;eful, he who maketh them Gods, affirms al&s;o, That they &s;hall die like men. His words not only a&s;&s;ert their mortality, but imply the great importance and utility of their knowledge of it, and of their frequently and &s;eriou&s;ly contemplating upon it, and on their re&s;pon&s;ibility to a tribunal higher than their own.</P>

<P N="1">I. I AM to &s;how the maje&s;ty of civil rulers: or that GOD highly exalts &s;ome men in genius, dignity and u&s;efulne&s;s above others.</P>
<P>THE SUPREME MAJESTY, in the text and context, expre&s;s|ly terms the kings, magi&s;trates and rulers of I&s;rael, Gods. This, of all names, is the mo&s;t high, venerable and glorious. When given by GOD him&s;elf, it mu&s;t be with great proprie|ty; importing the high exaltation, maje&s;ty and importance of magi&s;trates and civil government: That they are in&s;tituted by him, and bear a re&s;emblance of his glorious maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>CIVIL government, however different, in different times and countries, is of GOD. He expre&s;sly appointed it among his own people. It was his expre&s;s command, <HI>Judges and officers &s;halt thou make thee in all thy gates</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Deut. xvi.18.</NOTE>. The divine gov|ernment is univer&s;al. HE <HI>hath prepared his throne in the hea|vens; and his kingdom ruleth over all</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm, ciii.19.</NOTE>. All other rulers are of GOD, as well as tho&s;e of his own peculiar people. Hence that remarkable pa&s;&s;age, <HI>By me kings reign, and princes decree ju&s;tice. By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prov. viii.15, 16.</NOTE>. The apo&s;tle Paul expre&s;sly affirms, <HI>The powers that be are ordained of</HI> GOD. <HI>And there is no power but of</HI> GOD <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiii.1, 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="038679_0007_1012AF9C51AE9898">CIVIL government is founded in rea&s;on. It originates in the divine philanthropy; and has its foundation in the pa|ternal care, ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s of the common parent of all his creatures. It is de&s;igned to be a re&s;emblance of him in the righteou&s;ne&s;s and purity of his laws and admini&s;tra|tion. When it is good, it bears a glorious re&s;emblance of him, and is one of the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings enjoyed by man. As mankind are, this is the grand &s;ecurity of life, limb, lib|erty, property, dome&s;tic, public, civil and religious peace and order; and indeed of all the ble&s;&s;ings of &s;ocial life. This only defends us again&s;t violence, inju&s;tice, robbery, war, and death. Without it there could be no order, &s;trength, beauty, unity, or peace in &s;ociety. Nay, the un|re&s;trained lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions of men, like a mighty tornado or inundation would &s;weep from the earth every thing which is plea&s;ant and valuable to man.</P>
<P>AS GOD hath in&s;tituted civil government, &s;o men of &s;in|gular genius and mental powers elevated to &s;eats of earth|ly dominion are his mini&s;ters, and, in their legi&s;lative and executive capacity, bear his image as the SUPREME RULER and JUDGE of the univer&s;e. They &s;tand in his place, act un|der his authority, legi&s;late and judge for him. They are his officers to &s;uppre&s;s violence, fraud, di&s;&s;ipation and every wickedne&s;s which injures the public weal, and to maintain truth, order, righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace in the earth. Hence it is written, <HI>Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord, who is with you in judgment</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">II. Chron. xix.6.</NOTE>. The civil ruler mu&s;t imitate GOD in the integrity of his heart, in the righte|ou&s;ne&s;s and purity of his law, and in the impartiality of his government. The divine throne is e&s;tabli&s;hed in righteou&s;|ne&s;s; <HI>ju&s;tice and judgment are the habitation of it.</HI> The divine law is perfect and pure. How great and awful is the ma|je&s;ty of civil magi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">tes in this view? They are law-givers to guard the life, property and liberties of the people; to defend, encourage and reward the righteous, to puni&s;h the wicked, to cut off the violent man, and evil doers from the earth. They are exalted to &s;eats and thrones of judgment, to defend the poor, the fatherle&s;s and the widow: to do ju&s;|tice and judgment, and to e&s;tabli&s;h truth, and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and peace in the earth. With the Lord, who&s;e re&s;emblance they bear, <HI>there is no iniquity, nor re&s;pect of per&s;ons, nor taking of gifts</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">ver&s;e 7.</NOTE>. It is therefore commanded with re&s;pect to them, <HI>Ye &s;hall not re&s;pect per&s;ons in judgment, but you &s;hall hear the

&s;mall as well as the great</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Deut. i.17.</NOTE>. <HI>Thou &s;halt not wre&s;t judgment, thou &s;halt not re&s;pect per&s;ons, neither take a gift. That which is alto|gether ju&s;t &s;halt thou follow</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">chapter xvi.19.20.</NOTE>. They are ve&s;ted with power to kill, and to keep alive, as law and ju&s;tice demand. They are mini&s;ters of GOD not only for good, but they are reven|gers, to execute wrath upon them who do evil. <HI>They bear not the &s;word in vain.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiii.</NOTE></P>
<P>CIVIL magi&s;trates &s;hould imitate the SUPREME RULER in his paternal care and goodne&s;s over his creatures, in his com|pa&s;&s;ion, and in the goodne&s;s of his government. He rules in mercy as well as righteou&s;ne&s;s. He does good unto all, and his tender mercies are over all his works. His whole government is good. All the happine&s;s of heaven and earth, in time and eternity flows from it. The pure river of the water of life clear as chry&s;tal proceeds out of the THRONE of GOD and the LAMB. In like manner their con&s;titutions of government, the whole body of their laws, and all their ad|mini&s;trations &s;hould be directed to the public good. They &s;hould exceedingly love the people, the public order and hap|pine&s;s; &mdash;be of a public, patriotic and noble &s;pirit, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing high paternal affections towards all the people. They &s;hould con&s;ider their burdens and &s;tudy to make them as light as po&s;&s;ible;&mdash;to under&s;tand their intere&s;ts, and the means of promoting them, and employ all their abilities, honors and influence for the common weal. This will make their gov|ernment gladdening as the light, refre&s;hing as the gentle dews and &s;howers which fertilize the earth, and through the divine benignity, fill men's hearts with food and glad<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters"> Hence it is written, <HI>When the righteous are in authority the peo+ple rejoice.</HI> The ju&s;t man who ruleth over men, &s;aith GOD, <HI>Shall be as the light of the morning, when the &s;un ri&s;eth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender gra&s;s &s;pringing out of the earth by clear &s;hining after rain</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">II. Sam. xxiii.4.</NOTE>! The ri&s;ing &s;un, in a clear morning, &s;preads an univer&s;al joy, and its clear &s;hining after rain, has the mo&s;t exten&s;ive and beneficial effects. So the influence of a good ruler extends its happy effects to every community, family and individual in a whole nation. It gives order, &s;afety, peace and joy to all. In this view how amiable, dignified and glorious is the good ruler. In what an high and important &s;en&s;e does he re&s;emble the MOST HIGH? On the&s;e accounts it has generally been &s;uppo&s;ed that magi&s;trates, in the &s;criptures, are called GODS.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="038679_0009_1012AFA3C19DC5C8">THERE is yet another important, and perhaps a principal rea&s;on, why the Kings of Judah and I&s;rael were called Gods; Becau&s;e they were illu&s;trious types of the MESSIAH, the SON of GOD. In this re&s;pect they might be called Gods: and every one of them children of the MOST HIGH. But in this view no rulers &s;ince the coming of CHRIST can be called by this high and reverend name. In the other view, however, they are a happy re&s;emblance of the DIVINE MAJESTY, and their character is mo&s;t venerable and u&s;eful. The more wi&s;e, righteous, patriotic and exten&s;ively u&s;eful they are, the more happily they an&s;wer to the high and awful name by which they are characterized. Such officers are the LORD'S, the PILLARS of the earth, and he hath &s;et the world upon them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I. Sam. ii.8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HE rai&s;es them up with all their &s;uperior abilities natural or acquired; and by his providence exalts them to the &s;ever|al &s;tations in which he de&s;igns them to act, for the defence, peace and pro&s;perity of his kingdom. As known unto him are all his works from the foundation of the world, &s;o he qualifies men, in the different periods of time, for the great purpo&s;es which he has in view. He brings them on to the great theatre of action; and makes them, through his ble&s;s|ing, adequate to the emergencies of the church, and the ad|mirable events which he de&s;igns to accompli&s;h.</P>
<P>THE natural and acquired abilities of men are exceedingly different. The di&s;parity between &s;ome men and others is, probably. nearly as great as between &s;ome angels and men. David is repre&s;ented, As <HI>wi&s;e according to the wi&s;dom of an an|gel to know all things that were in the earth</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">II. Sam. xiv.20.</NOTE>. GOD gives to &s;ome men, natural genius, largene&s;s of heart, an acumen and pe|netration far beyond the common &s;hare of their fellows. He forms them for great actions and purpo&s;es. Thus he gave to <HI>Solomon wi&s;dom and under&s;tanding exceeding much, and largene&s;s of heart, even as the &s;and which is on the &s;ea &s;hore</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I. Kings iv.29.</NOTE>. He al&s;o, &s;o governs events, in his providence, that the natural powers of &s;ome per&s;ons &s;hall be greatly improved by litera|ture and all advantages to form them for public u&s;efulne&s;s. To &s;ome men he gives great talents for government. Like the men of I&s;&s;achar they have an under&s;tanding of the times, &s;o that they di&s;cern both time and judgment; and know what I&s;rael ought to do. On others he be&s;tows uncommon
<PB N="10" REF="038679_0010_1012AFA552E6CA78">
military abilities; magnanimity, and penetration of mind, &s;trength and agility of body, &s;o that they are admirably calculated to defend his church again&s;t her enemies. In &s;ome in&s;tances the&s;e are both united in the &s;ame per&s;on. Thus, when the exigencies of the church required it, GOD rai&s;ed up David, and gave him not only great wi&s;dom, policy, and military &s;kill, but uncommon &s;trength and agility, &s;o that the bow of &s;teel was broken by his arms, and he ran through the troops and leaped over the walls and ramparts of his enemies<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm xviii.29, 34</NOTE>. For his a&s;&s;i&s;tance he gave him captains and gen|erals, <HI>who were men of war, fit for the battle, who could handle &s;hield and buckler, who&s;e faces were as the faces of lions, and who were &s;wift as the roes upon the mountains</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I. Chron. xii.8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN GOD de&s;igned to deliver I&s;rael from their bondage in Egypt, and to form them into a di&s;tinct kingdom, he gave them Mo&s;es for a lawgiver and deliverer. When they needed a general to lead them into Canaan, he rai&s;ed up a Jo&s;hua. When the holy &s;eed were doomed to an univer&s;al and total de&s;truction, by the device of a wicked Haman, he prepared an E&s;ther, with all the charms of nature and good &s;en&s;e, and with the poli&s;h of a fine education, to ravi&s;h the heart of the king of Per&s;ia, and by her influence to obtain a rever&s;al of the fatal decree. When it was his purpo&s;e to de&s;troy Babylon, and to deliver his people from the North country, he called Cyrus, and girded him with his might; <HI>That he might let go his captives and build his city</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah xlv.13.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN like manner, when he &s;aw, that men were about to ri&s;e up again&s;t the people of America, and &s;wallow them up quickly, unle&s;s his merciful interpo&s;ition &s;hould prevent, he qualified and exalted men to places of tru&s;t, in the cabinet and in the field, for their defence. At that period aro&s;e a Franklin, that uncommon genius, who fir&s;t di&s;covered the philo&s;ophy of the electric fluid, and taught how to conduct the tremendous bolts of heaven harmle&s;s from the dwellings of men. Then appeared in mature age, and the full vigor of life, a Randolph, a Hancock, an Adams, a Jay, and other di&s;tingui&s;hed characters, to guide our coun&s;els in the cabinet and negociate our affairs in foreign kingdoms; and that il|lu&s;trious man, GEORGE WASHINGTON, to command our armies in the field, and be the Saviour of America. For his a&s;&s;i&s;|tance there appeared a Green, a Montgomery, a Woo&s;ter, a Sullivan, a Lincoln, a Wayne, a Mercer, and other heroic

patriots to defend our liberties, and lead us to peace and glory. The&s;e, with the other great and patriotic characters who labored with them in the &s;ame glorious cau&s;e, were his in&s;truments to effect the great work which he de&s;igned. He gave them their powers and rai&s;ed them to the elevated &s;ta|tions in which they acted. <HI>For promotion cometh neither from the Ea&s;t, nor from the We&s;t, nor from the South But God is the judge; He putteth down one, and &s;etteth up another.</HI> Hence the powers that be are of GOD. He creates and pre&s;erves them for his own purpo&s;es, and removes them at his plea&s;ure. Though he &s;tands in no need of creatures, means, or in&s;tru|ments; can work with or without them, as &s;eemeth good in his &s;ight, yet it plea&s;eth him, ordinarily, to govern the world, and accompli&s;h great events by them.</P>
<P>This brings me to ob&s;erve</P>
<P N="2">II. THAT however highly they may be exalted in office, or in any other re&s;pects above other men, they are equally with them &s;ubject to mortality and all its con&s;equences.</P>
<P>THIS is a truth however melancholy and deeply affecting it may be, which lies &s;o open to univer&s;al ob&s;ervation, that it needs no laboured illu&s;tration. The bu&s;ine&s;s of a preacher is rather to impre&s;s, than demon&s;trate a truth &s;o obvious. The experience of all ages, of every year and month from the apo&s;tacy to the pre&s;ent time bears witne&s;s to it.

In a particular manner, &s;hould they be acknowleged, in his cau&s;ing &s;uch a number of great, illuminated, bold, and patriotic characters to appear on the theatre of action, at the time of the American revo|lution.

The &s;upreme authority of Virginia was &s;o deeply impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of his worth and military talents, that he was made adjutant-general of all the troops rai&s;ed, and to be rai&s;ed in Virginia. In 1758, he commanded the van-brigade, in the army of general Forbes, in the &s;ucce&s;sful expedition again&s;t fort Du Que&s;ne. From about the year 1760 to the commencement of the di&s;pute with Great-Britain, he was elected a member of the general a&s;&s;embly in Virginia, was a magi&s;trate, and a judge of the court of the county of Fairfax, in which he re&s;ided. In 1774, he was elected member to the fir&s;t congre&s;s. He was elected al&s;o member of the &s;e|cond, in 1775, in which on the 15th of June he was appoint|ed commander in chief of the armies of the united colonies. This arduous command he accepted at a time of great peril to America; and during eight &s;ucce&s;&s;ive campaigns, &s;ubjected him&s;elf to the hard&s;hips of a &s;oldier, jeoparding his life in the high places, for the defence of the liberties, lives and property of his fellow-citizens, and to &s;ecure the peace, &s;afety and pro&s;perity of his country.</P>
<P>WHEN he took the command, the Americans had not a regular regiment nor fortre&s;s, nor did they po&s;&s;e&s;s an arm|ed &s;hip. They were almo&s;t without arms, artillery, ammu|nition and other means of defence. The colonies were at|tacked by &s;ea and land, by the mo&s;t formidable force that ever invaded a young country. He was called to act again&s;t the be&s;t generals and troops which Europe could boa&s;t. They had gathered laurels in Europe and America, in Flanders, at Loui&s;burg, and on the plains of Abraham. They were furni&s;hed with the be&s;t arms, and the fine&s;t train of artillery, &s;erved by the be&s;t engineers which Great-Britain or Germa|ny could produce. A great part of his army, until nearly the clo&s;e of the war, con&s;i&s;ted of militia and troops who were only temporary; and he had often to di&s;band one army and form another in the very face of the enemy. Yet he made a &s;urpri&s;ing defence. He was never once &s;urprized, never lo&s;t an army, nor &s;uffered any con&s;iderable defeat.

yet he finally baffled all their arts, totally defeated their de&s;igns, and, under the &s;uperintendance of a gracious pro|vidence, rai&s;ed the United States to independence, peace, and glory.</P>
<P>DURING his command, he exhibited &s;triking demon&s;tra|tions of an uncommon genius, a &s;ingular knowledge of man|kind, and the mo&s;t ma&s;terly &s;trokes of general&s;hip.</P>
<P>WHEN he arrived before Bo&s;ton, he found it inve&s;ted with a half armed and undi&s;ciplined multitude, ha&s;tily drawn to|gether from their fields and &s;hops, the greater part of whom, though a bold and virtuous yeomanry, had never before &s;een a campaign, nor the forming of a &s;ingle regiment. In New England, he had made no connexions, and was &s;carcely known. To its legi&s;latures, to its men of principal charac|ter, to the officers and troops, who compo&s;ed his army, he was an entire &s;tranger. Yet he was able, of this chaotic ma&s;s, to form an army, introduce &s;y&s;tem, obedience, di&s;ci|pline, and bravery. He at once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of the af|fection and confidence of his officers and of the whole army. Equally did he po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of the e&s;teem of all the New-England patriots and colonies; and was able to point their whole force to the object of his wi&s;hes. Though he had not only an army to harmonize, before a numerous enemy of veterans, but, for a time, almo&s;t to create the means of de|fence<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">When general Wa&s;hington arrived at head quarters at Cambridge, the army had neither tents, nor commi&s;&s;aries, nor any regular &s;upplies of provi&s;ions. They had neither engineers capable of planning regular works, nor tools to erect them. They had no proper train of artille|ry, their arms were very defective, and numbers had none at all. With re&s;pect to ammunition, they were &s;till more deficient. On the 4th of Augu&s;t it was found that the whole &s;tock of powder in the four New-England colonies, was little more than &s;ufficient to furni&s;h nine rounds for each man, then inve&s;ting the town. After every exertion which could be made, as late as February 1776, there were 2,000 troops with|out arms. Enterpri&s;ing and high &s;pirited officers, with their adherents, had pu&s;hed forward to the camp, without regard to rank, the appoint|ments of Congre&s;s, or their re&s;pective colonies.

They were aided by two floating batteries and 150 &s;hips of war and tran&s;ports. To confine them within their limits the general was obliged to form lines of about ten miles in circumference. His army when mo&s;t numerous con&s;i&s;ted of no more than 14,500 men; but at the clo&s;e of the year, while the old army was di&s;banding, and a new one forming, it amounted only to 9650. Yet his arrangements were &s;o judicious, that the enemy never made a &s;ingle attempt upon his lines. With a view to drive the ho&s;tile army from Bo&s;ton, the general was reinforced with 7,000 militia; at which time he found him&s;elf at the head of 17,000 effective men. But he was greatly embarra&s;&s;ed for want of ammunition and military &s;tores &s;ufficient for &s;uch an attempt. However, on the night of the 4th of March 1776, he ordered a detach|ment, under general Thomas to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Dorche&s;ter heights. The van was compo&s;ed of a covering party of 800 men. To the&s;e &s;ucceed 1200 fatigue men with carts carrying on their entrenching tools. In the rear was a train of more than 200 carts loaded with fa&s;cines and bundles of hay. Here every thing was conducted with the profounde&s;t &s;ilence, while the attention of the enemy was drawn to an|other quarter, by a bri&s;k bombardment and cannonade: and &s;uch were the preparations and di&s;po&s;itions made by the general, that by the mor|ning light the provincials had completed &s;uch lines of defence, as a&s;|toni&s;hed the enemy. General Howe in particular, in con&s;ternation, was heard to exclaim, "I know not what I &s;hall do; the rebels have done more in one night, than my whole army could have done in months." By taking this po&s;ition the general had &s;uch command of the harbor and town, that the enemy determined on an immediate evacuation of Bo&s;ton.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>HIS retreat from Long I&s;land, in 1776, was &s;uch a ma&s;|terpiece of general&s;hip as is rarely exhibited in the hi&s;tory of man. In one &s;hort night, in the face of a &s;uperior ene|my, he brought off about nine thou&s;and men, without the lo&s;s of a &s;ingle company. His retreat from the I&s;land of New York, and through the Jer&s;ies were exhibitions of the &s;ame great mind.</P>
<P>THE manner of his recro&s;&s;ing the Delaware, the &s;urpri&s;al and capture of the He&s;&s;ians at Trenton, the march which he &s;tole upon Cornwallis, and the defeat of the Briti&s;h troops at Princeton, were feats of greater brilliancy, and far more important and glorious in their con&s;equences. The affairs of the union were now at their lowe&s;t ebb. The political pul&s;e was almo&s;t gone; but the&s;e unexpected and &s;urprizing movements and victories, &s;natched us from the jaws of death, rekindled the vital &s;park, and diffu&s;ed life and joy through all America<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>All the American fortre&s;&s;es had now fallen before the enemy; gen|eral Wa&s;hington had been hotly pur&s;ued through New Jer&s;ey acro&s;s the Delaware into Penn&s;ylvania. His army was nearly annihilated, and the remains of it were in a manner unclothed and un&s;hod. The coun|try was in a &s;tate of deep de&s;pondency, and many were going over to the enemy and &s;ubmitting to Lord Howe. In this cri&s;is general Wa&s;h|ington, on Chri&s;tmas evening, made di&s;po&s;itions for cro&s;&s;ing the Dela|ware in three divi&s;ions, with a view to attack the enemy's po&s;ts in &s;o many different places. The night was dark and &s;evere; the &s;torm roared, the hail de&s;cended, and the Delaware rolled down in currents of ice; but he cro&s;&s;ed with 2400 men to the ho&s;tile &s;hore, and after a march of nine miles ju&s;t at the dawn of the morning, December 26, &s;urpri&s;ed the He&s;&s;ian po&s;t at Trenton. About forty of the enemy were killed or wounded, twenty three officers, 886 privates were made pri&s;|oners. Col Rall, who commanded the po&s;t, was &s;lain. The &s;ame day the general cro&s;&s;ed the river into Penn&s;ylvania. Two of the Americans were killed, two were frozen to death, and &s;ix or &s;even were wounded. The general having &s;ecured his pri&s;oners, on the 2d of Jaunuary 1777, again cro&s;&s;ed the Delaware, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Trenton. His army con&s;i&s;ted of about 5000 men, of whom 1800 were continentals, who&s;e time of enli&s;tment was now expired, their clothing was no ways &s;uffi|cient for the &s;ea&s;on, and they were worn down with &s;ervices. But, by the per&s;ua&s;ion of the general, they were induced to tarry &s;ix weeks longer. The others were raw militia men, brought into the field in the then pre&s;ent emergency. By this time the royal army had been a&s;|&s;embled at Princeton, and Lord Cornwallis at its head, was coming on, with great force, to repair the injury they had &s;u&s;tained in their late defeat. At 4 o'clock in the afternoon the enemy attacked an advanced po&s;t, which general Wa&s;hington had placed with four field pieces, a little north of the town. General Green was &s;ent forward with a de|tachment to &s;upport it; but the enemy were in &s;uch force that it was with difficulty, that he made good his retreat. The American army was ha&s;tily formed behind Sanpink bridge and the creek of that name, which runs through the town. The general had a good train of field artillery, and a number of pieces were &s;o placed as to concentrate their fire upon the bridge and the road leading to it. The enemy's grena|diers pre&s;&s;ed on with great &s;pirit to force the bridge. Their attack was &s;o warm, and their fire &s;o heavy, that the general was obliged to expo&s;e his per&s;on and u&s;e all his exertions to prevent his troops from giving way; but the fire of the field pieces and of the troops was &s;o well directed that after three un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts the enemy retired. The Americans kept their po&s;ition until night, and both armies main|tained a cannonade upon each other. The feeble American army was now in a mo&s;t critical &s;ituation. To retreat and pa&s;s the river in the face of &s;uch an army was impracticable. Be&s;ides, it would hazard the city of Philadelphia, and extingui&s;h every ray of hope which had begun to dawn in the late &s;ucce&s;s. To ri&s;k a general action with &s;uch inferior force, would have been madne&s;s. The liberties of America, &s;eemed, at this time, to be &s;u&s;pended upon a mere thread. In this dilemma, general Wa&s;hington determined, by a circuitous march, to get into the rear of the enemy and attack Princeton. To deceive them he ordered the fires to be kept in full blaze until the morning. About midnight the whole army took up their line of march, and arriving near Prince|ton, a little before day, fell in with Colonel Mawhood, at the head of his regiment, marching for Trenton. The Colonel was a gallant offi|cer, and commencing a clo&s;e fire upon the Americans and charging with bayonets, they gave way, and a general panic &s;eemed to be &s;preading. At this critical moment, the American Fabius appeared with all the fire and boldne&s;s of Hannibal or the Scipios, encouraging his troops, interpo&s;ing him&s;elf between the two armies not more than thirty yards di&s;tance from the enemy's front with the head of his hor&s;e toward them, while they di&s;charged their pieces. The Americans an|imated by his example, returned the fire and encompa&s;&s;ed the Briti&s;h on every &s;ide; upon which the colonel, with what men he could, broke through and made his e&s;cape. While the general was engaged in this quarter, the re&s;t of the army engaged two other Briti&s;h regiments, who fled before them. Some of the enemy retired into the College and at|tempted to defend them&s;elves in that; but the Americans no &s;ooner began to fire upon them with their field pieces, than they &s;urrendered. Sixty of the Briti&s;h were killed, many wounded, and three hundred taken pri&s;oners. General Wa&s;hington marched off in &s;afety to Morri&s;|town. The Briti&s;h generals were filled with &s;uch con&s;ternation at the&s;e unexpected and brilliant movements, that they immediately evacuated Trenton and Princeton, and, in a few weeks, the whole &s;tate of New-Jer&s;ey, except Brun&s;wick and Amboy, to which the Briti&s;h were con|fined, was completely recovered.</P>

One great thing nece&s;&s;ary to effect this was to amu&s;e the Briti&s;h generals with the idea that a formidable attack was to be made on New-York, until the Che&s;apeak &s;hould be blocked up, and &s;uch force concentrated in Virginia, as would be adequate to the reduction of Cornwallis.&mdash; For this purpo&s;e a plan was concerted for the meeting of governor Trumbull and his council at Danbury, in July or Augu&s;t, with a number of principal characters from other &s;tates, to deliberate on mea|&s;ures for taking New York. This was publicly given out, and great expectations were entertained from the meeting of &s;uch a number of &s;ages. The patriots met at the time the general wi&s;hed, and all the wi&s;e heads were laid together, and plans devi&s;ed in their united wi&s;|dom. All thought they were a&s;&s;i&s;ting the general, and that he was about vigorou&s;ly to pur&s;ue the wi&s;e &s;chemes which had been concerted. Requi&s;itions had been made on the New England &s;tates of 6200 militia to fill up their re&s;pective quotas, to be ready within a week of the time for which they &s;hould be called for. Flat bottomed boats &s;ufficient for the tran&s;portation of 5000 men had been brought down Hud&s;on's river to the vicinity of the American army. Count de Rochambeau, with the French army, had marched from Rhode I&s;land, and joined the American army. Ovens were erected oppo&s;ite to Staten I&s;land, and appearances were made for the formation of a permanent camp in that quarter. About the &s;ame time a letter from general Wa&s;hington was pretended to be intercepted containing a plan of the de&s;igned oper|ations again&s;t New York. Such a combination of circum&s;tances in|duced the royal generals and the people in general to believe that the reduction of New York was the grand object. At the &s;ame time the general was marching his troops through the country to the Che&s;apeak. Governor Trumbull had hardly reached Hartford, in his return from the council at Danbury, before he received a letter from general Wa&s;h|ington, acquainting him, that the French fleet was arrived in the Che|&s;apeak, and that he was going to Virginia.</NOTE>.</P>

Notwith&s;tanding his great predilection for the enjoyments of private life, yet at the unanimous call of his country, he accepted the high and arduous office of the chief magi&s;trate of the nation.

A &s;econd time was he unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en to the &s;upreme magi&s;tracy. What im|portant &s;ervices did he again render to his country? While war has hung out its bloody flag through the principal na|tions in Europe, and through a great part of the old world; and mankind have been &s;laughtered, cities era&s;ed, and king|doms &s;haken beyond all parallel in modern ages, through his wi&s;dom, and invincible firmne&s;s, the United States have not only enjoyed peace; but, beyond all former precedent, have increa&s;ed in number, &s;ettlements, hu&s;bandry, navigation and commerce.

At the clo&s;e of the war public credit was at the lowe&s;t ebb. The troops though they had performed the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential &s;ervices for their country, were unpaid. Some of the principal officers, and many of the &s;oldiers were determined never to lay down their arms until they had redre&s;&s;ed their own grievances.

In this alar|ming cri&s;is, how did the magnanimity of the general and his invincible attachment to his country &s;hine forth? In&s;tead of giving the lea&s;t coun|tenance to &s;uch mutinous de&s;igns, he convened his officers, and with a kind of paternal tenderne&s;s addre&s;&s;ed them on the &s;ubject.

<P>MOURN thankfully, that you have enjoyed your beloved Wa&s;hington, for &s;o many years; and that GOD enabled him to render unto his country &s;uch exten&s;ive and e&s;&s;ential &s;ervi|ces: That we have an Adams, a man &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed in po|litics, of &s;uch known and tried integrity, and who for &s;uch a length of time, hath rendered &s;uch e&s;&s;ential, national &s;ervices, to guide our political affairs; and that while &s;o large a por|tion of mankind are engaged in &s;uch bloody and horrible wars, we enjoy &s;uch a degree of peace, &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hing privileges and growing pro&s;perity. What united, con&s;tant and animated thank&s;givings do &s;uch ble&s;&s;ings demand?</P>
<P>MOURN with profit to your&s;elves. All the di&s;pen&s;ations of GOD are full of in&s;truction. His cha&s;ti&s;ements are for our profit. Let us be &s;ure to be in&s;tructed and benefited by them. Let us learn the incalculable evil of &s;in, which has &s;ubjected us, and the whole race of man to death: which opens every grave and fills every bitter cup: which expo|&s;eth every &s;oul of man to indignation and wrath, tribulation and angui&s;h, and let us tremble and repent without delay. Let us entertain the deepe&s;t impre&s;&s;ions of the vanity of hu|man life, and of all &s;ublunary enjoyments; not only of the certainty, but nearne&s;s of death. Realize, my brethren, how &s;hort and precarious is the term of life and u&s;efulne&s;s. How the &s;hort term of twenty, or twenty-five years, has &s;wept the &s;tage of all the great men, who were upon it, at that di&s;tance of time? Where now are our generals, the pre&s;i|dents of Congre&s;s, and the governors of our &s;tates? Where are Randolph, Hancock, Huntington, Green and Wa&s;hing|ton, Trumbull, Gri&s;wold, and Wolcott? Where are their compatriots and cotemporaries, but in the grave? How nearly are tho&s;e &s;tepping off into eternity, who have been upon it the &s;ame length of time, or even longer? How &s;ud|den may be the awful tran&s;ition? How did a few hours re|duce our mo&s;t beloved and u&s;eful fellow-citizen, from a &s;tate of perfect health to a breathle&s;s corp&s;e? With what &s;eriou&s;|ne&s;s &s;hould every one enquire, am I ready for a change &s;o
<PB N="31" REF="038679_0031_1012AFE249604C90">
&s;udden and momentous? Shall we not all work while the day la&s;teth, &s;ince the night cometh, nay, may &s;o &s;uddenly come, when no man can work?</P>
<P>WHILE we contemplate great and pre-eminent characters let us &s;trive to imitate them. Behold, ye magi&s;trates of America, ye created and mortal gods, the character of your political father, your beloved Wa&s;hington, and while you admire, imitate his exalted virtues. Like him, by patrio|ti&s;m, integrity, impartiality and exten&s;ive u&s;efulne&s;s, make glad the hearts of your fellow-citizens, and embalm your names to the late&s;t po&s;terity. Like him harmonize the mea&s;ures and hearts of your countrymen, and promote our external and internal peace and pro&s;perity. Behold him, ye young men, and all ye inhabitants of the United States and learn to love your country, to prize its con&s;titutions, to be public &s;pirited and &s;eek her peace, and with your lives and property defend her ju&s;t rights and important intere&s;ts. Know how to appreciate your ine&s;timable privileges, your birth right and fair inheritance, tran&s;mitted to you from the mo&s;t worthy ance&s;tors, and purcha&s;ed at the expen&s;e of &s;o much blood and trea&s;ure. Defend them like men and never part with them, but with your lives. A&s;pire to true great|ne&s;s, con&s;i&s;ting in piety, righteou&s;ne&s;s, and univer&s;al good|ne&s;s. Be rich in faith and good works, and heirs of the kingdom which GOD hath promi&s;ed to them that love him<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I. Tim. vi.18, and James ii.5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN a word, mourn not with de&s;pondency, but with a firm and humble confidence in the power, wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of the SUPREME RULER. When creatures die, and you have the mo&s;t &s;triking demon&s;trations, that all which cometh is vanity, let this be your con&s;olation, that, The LORD reign|eth, that he will reign, and that his mercy endureth forever. He will never for&s;ake his people. If we will be willing and obedient, we &s;hall &s;till eat of the good of the land<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah i.19.</NOTE>. GOD is in the mid&s;t of Zion: HE <HI>will help her, and that right early</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm xlvi.5.</NOTE>. In HIM therefore let us repo&s;e all our hopes: To HIM ren|der all obedience, all honor and ble&s;&s;ing, thank&s;giving and power, maje&s;ty and dominion, now and for ever.</P>
