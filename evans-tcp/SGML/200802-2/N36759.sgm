<HEAD><HI>THE</HI> AFFECTING HISTORY, of the Dreadful Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of Fred|eric Manheim's family, who was taken pri&s;oners by the Indians, in 1779.</HEAD>
<P>FREDERIC Manheim, an indu&s;trious German, with his family, con&s;i&s;ting of his wife, Catharine, a daughter of eighteen years of age, and Maria and Chri&s;tina, his younge&s;t children (twins,) about &s;ixteen, re&s;ided near the river Mohawk, eight miles writ of John&s;ton. On the 19th of October, 1779, the father being at work at &s;ome di&s;tance from his habitation, and the mother and elde&s;t daughter on a vi&s;it at a neigh|bour's, two ho&s;tile Cana&s;adaga Indians ru&s;hed in, and captured the twin &s;i&s;ters.</P>
<P>The party to which tho&s;e &s;avages belonged, con&s;i&s;ted of fifty warriors, who after &s;ecuring twenty-three of the inhabitants of that neighbourhood, (among whom was the unfortunate Frederic Manheim) and firing their hou&s;es, retired for four days with the utmo&s;t pre|cipitancy, till they were quite &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e from pur&s;uit. The place where they halted on the evening of the day of re&s;t, was a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hick pine &s;wamp, which rendered the dark|ne&s;s of an uncommonly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">omy night, &s;till more dread|ful, The Indians kind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> fire, which they had not done before, and ordered their pri&s;oners, whom they keep together, to refre&s;h them&s;elves with &s;uch provi|&s;ions as they had. The Indians ate by them&s;elves. In|&s;tead of retiring to re&s;t after &s;upping&punc; the appalled cap|tives ob&s;erved their enemies bu&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d in operations which b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ded nothing good. Two &s;aplings were pruned clear of branches up to the very top, and all the bru&s;h clear|e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> away for &s;everal rods around them. While this was doing, others were &s;plitting pitch pine billers into &s;mall &s;plinters about five in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hes in length, and as &s;mall as one's little finger, &s;harpening one end, and dipping the other in melted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">.</P>
<P>At length, with countenances di&s;torted by infernal fury, and with hideous yells, the two &s;avages who had captured the haple&s;s Maria and Chri&s;tina, leaped into the mid&s;t of their circle, and dragged tho&s;e ill-fated maidens, &s;hrieking, from the embraces of their com|panions.

The&s;e warriors had di&s;agreed about who&s;e property the girls &s;hould be, as they had jointly &s;eized them; and, to terminate the di&s;pute, agreeably to the abominable u&s;age of the &s;avages, it was determined by the chiefs of the party, that the pri&s;oners, who gave <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;e to the contention, &s;hould be de&s;troyed; and that their captors &s;hould be the principle agents in the exe|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rable bu&s;ine&s;s.

And then to com|plete the infernal tragedy, the &s;plinters, all &s;tanding erect on the bleeding victims, were every one &s;et on fire, and exhibited a &s;cene of mon&s;trous mi&s;ery, beyond the power of &s;peech to de&s;cribe, or even the imagination to conceive. It was not until near three hours had elap|&s;ed from the commencement of their torments, and that they had lo&s;t almo&s;t every re&s;emblance of the hu|man form, that the&s;e helple&s;s virgins &s;unk down in the arms of their deliverer, Death.</P>

<HEAD><HI>REMARKABLE</HI> encounter of a white man with two Indians. In a letter to a gentleman of Philadelphia.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>We&s;tmoreland, <DATE>April 26, 1779.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WROTE you a note a few days ago, in which I promi&s;ed you the particulars of an affair between a white man of this county, and two Indians: now I mean to relate the whole &s;tory, and it is as follows:</P>
<P>The white man is upwards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ixty years of age; his name is David Morgan; he had, through fear of the Indians, fled to a tort about twenty miles above the province line, and near the ea&s;t &s;ide of Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ela river. From thence he &s;ent &s;ome of his younger chil|dren
<PB REF="048110_0004_1024FBB4C64B86C8" MS="y">
to his plantation, which was about a mile di&s;tant, there to do &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s in the field He afterwards thought fit to follow, and &s;ee how they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ared. Get|ting to his field&punc; and &s;eating him&s;elf upon the &s;ence, within view of his children, where they were at work, he e&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed two Indians making towards them; on which he called to his children to make their e&s;cape. The Indians immediately bent their cour&s;e towards him. He made the be&s;t ha&s;te to e&s;cape away, that his age and con&s;equent infirmity would permit; but &s;oon found he would be overtaken, which made him think of defence. Being-armed with a good rifle, he faced about, and found him&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of running four or five perches towards the Indians, in order to obtain &s;helter behind a tree of &s;ufficient &s;ize.</P>
<P>This unexpected in manceuvre obliged the Indians, who were clo&s;e by, to &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p where they had but &s;mall tim|ber to &s;helter behind, which gave Mr. Morgan an op|portunity of &s;hooting one of them dead upon the &s;pot. The other, taking the advantage of Morgan's empty gun, advanced upon him, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ut him to flight a &s;e|cond time, and being lighter of foot than the old man, &s;oon came up within a few paces, when he fired at him, but fortunately mi&s;&s;ed him. On this Mr. Morgan <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aced about again, to try his fortune, and clubbed his fire|lock. The Indian, by this time, had got his tomahawk in order for a throw, at which they are very dextrous. Morgan made the blow, and the Indian the throw, al|mo&s;t at the &s;ame in&s;tant, by which the little finger was cut off Morgan's left hand, and the one next to it al|mo&s;t off, and his gun broke off by the lock. Now they came to clo&s;e grips. Morgan put the Indian down; but &s;oon found him&s;elf overturned, and the Indian up|on him, feeling for his knife, and yelling mo&s;t hideou&s;|ly, as their manner is, when they look upon victory to be certain. However, a woman's apron, which the In|dian had plundered out of a hou&s;e in the neighbourhood, and tied on him, above his knife, was now in his way, and &s;o hindered him getting at it quickly, that Morgan got one of his fingers fa&s;t in his mouth, and deprived him of the u&s;e of that hand, by holding it; and di&s;con|certed him con&s;iderably by chewing it; all the while ob&s;erving how he would come on with his knife&punc;
<PB REF="048110_0005_1024FBB8AEF92580">
length the Indian had got hold of his knife, but &s;o far towards the blade, that Morgan got a &s;mall hold of the hinder end; and as the Indian pulled it out of the &s;cab|bard, Morgan giving his finger a &s;evere &s;crew with his teeth, twitched it out through his hand, cutting it mo&s;t grievou&s;ly. By this time they were both got partly on their feet, and the Indian was endeavouring to di&s;en|gage him&s;elf; but Morgan held fa&s;t by the finger, and quickly applied the point of the knife to the &s;ide of its &s;avage owner; a bone happening in the way prevent|ed its penetrating any great depth, but a &s;econd blow directed more towards the belly, found free pa&s;&s;age into his bowels. The old man turned the point upward<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, made a large wound, burying the knife therein, and &s;o took his departure in&s;tantly to the fort, with the news of his adventure.</P>
<P>On the report of Mr. Morgan, a party went out from the fort, and found the fir&s;t Indian where he had fallen; the &s;econd they found not yet dead&punc; at one hundred yards di&s;tance from the &s;cene of action, hid in the top of a fallen tree, where he had picked the knife out of his body, after which had come out parched corn, &amp;c. and had bound up his wound with the apron aforemen|tioned; and on fir&s;t &s;ight he &s;aluted them with, How do do, broder, how do do, broder? but alas! poor &s;avage, their brotherhood to him extended only to tomahawking, &s;calping, and, to gratify &s;ome peculiar feelings of their own, they &s;kinned them both.</P>
