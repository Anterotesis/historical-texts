<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>IN the beginning of the year 1799, I received from my friend Dr. LETTSOM of London, a copy of Dr. EDWARD JENNER's "<HI>inquiry into the cau&s;es and effects of the</HI> VARIOLAE VACCINAE, or COW-POX"; a di&s;ea&s;e totally unknown in this quarter of the world. On peru&s;ing this work, I was &s;truck with the un&s;peak|able advantages that might accrue to this country,
<PB N="4" REF="039022_0003_10138A79DFDDE1F8">and indeed to the human race at large, from the di&s;|covery of a mild di&s;temper that would ever after &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the con&s;titution from that terrible &s;courge, the &s;mall-pox. My attention was not the le&s;s awakened by a previous impre&s;&s;ion that the &s;mall-pox came originally from the brute creation; for all that I could recollect of the hi&s;tory of the famous Mahomet, and his <HI>&s;uc|ce&s;&s;or,</HI> and of modern Arabia, con&s;pired to &s;trength|en the idea that the &s;mall-pox came to the human race through the bruce creation.</P>
<P>DR. GEORGE PEARSON's book, which I received &s;oon after that of Dr. JENNER's, confirmed in a &s;atis|factory manner the mo&s;t important part of JENNER's doctrine.</P>
<P>As the ordinary mode of communicating even me|dical di&s;coveries in this country is by news-papers, I drew up the following account of the <HI>cow-pox,</HI> which was printed in the <HI>Columbian Centinel,</HI> March 12th, 1799.</P>
<P>SOMETHING CURIOUS IN THE MEDICAL LINE.</P>
<P>EVERY body has heard of tho&s;e di&s;tempers, ac|companied with pocks or pu&s;tles, called the <HI>&s;mall pox,</HI> the <HI>chicken-pox</HI> and the <HI>&s;wine-pox,</HI> but few have ever heard of the <HI>cow-pox,</HI> or if you like the term better, the <HI>cow &s;mall-pox</HI>; or to expre&s;s it in technical lan|guage, the <HI>variolae vaccinae.</HI> There is, however, &s;uch
<PB N="5" REF="039022_0004_10138AAA6FFE6850">a di&s;ea&s;e, which has been noticed here and there in &s;e|veral parts of England, more particularly in Glouce&s;|ter&s;hire, for &s;ixty or &s;eventy years pa&s;t, but has never been an object of medical inquiry until very lately.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>variolae vaccinae</HI> or <HI>cow-pox,</HI> is very readily communicated to tho&s;e who milk cows infected with it. This malady appears fir&s;t on the teats of the cows in the form of irregular pu&s;tles or pocks.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See JENNER, p. 3. &amp; 4.</NOTE> They are commonly of a pali&s;h blue, &s;omewhat approaching to livid, and &s;urrounded by an ery&s;ipelatous inflammation, re&s;embling the St. Anthony's fire. The&s;e pu&s;tles, un|le&s;s timely remedied, degenerate into tho&s;e ragged ul|cers known by the &s;urgeons under the name of <HI>phage|denic.</HI> The cows &s;oon become &s;ick, and the &s;ecretion of milk is le&s;&s;ened, but I never heard of one dying with it. Tho&s;e who milk cows thus effected, &s;eldom or ever fail catching the di&s;temper, <HI>if there be cracks, wounds, or abra&s;ions in the hands.</HI> That is to &s;ay, <HI>they are inoculated.</HI> When infected, there appear on different parts of the hands and wri&s;ts, inflamed &s;pots, having the appearance of bli&s;ters, produced by burns. The&s;e run quickly on to &s;uppuration. The&s;e &s;uper|ficial &s;uppurations have a circular form with their edg|es more elevated than the centre, very much re&s;em|bling a certain &s;tage of the &s;mall-pox. The&s;e depre&s;&s;|ed pu&s;tles or pocks, are of a colour approaching to
<PB N="6" REF="039022_0005_10138A7B6DAEF628">blue. Ab&s;orption now takes place, and a &s;orene&s;s and &s;ometimes tumors appear in the arm pits. Then the arterial &s;y&s;tem becomes affected; the pul&s;e is quickened, and &s;hivering with a general la&s;&s;itude and pains in the back and limbs &s;upervene, and the&s;e &s;ymp||toms are not unfrequently accompanied with vomit|ing. There is too, a pain in the head and dizzine&s;s. The&s;e &s;ymptoms varying in their degrees and violence, generally continue from one day to three or four, leaving ulcerated &s;ores about the hands, re&s;embling tho&s;e on the cows teats, from whence they &s;prung. The lips, no&s;trils and eye-lids are &s;ometimes affected with &s;ores, but the&s;e evidently ari&s;e from their being rubbed or &s;cratched with the patient's infected fingers. This is the common cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e with the hu|man &s;pecies. <HI>No per&s;on was ever known to die of this di&s;temper.</HI> But what makes this newly di&s;cover|ed di&s;ea&s;e &s;o very curious, and &s;o extremely important is, that every per&s;on thus affected, is EVER AFTER SECURED FROM THE ORDINARY SMALL-POX, <HI>let him be ever &s;o much expo&s;ed to the effluvium of it, or let ever &s;o much ripe matter be in&s;erted into the &s;kin by inoculation.</HI> In other words&mdash;a per&s;on who has undergone the <HI>local</HI> di&s;ea&s;e and <HI>&s;pecific fe|ver</HI> occa&s;ioned by the cow-pox infection, is <HI>thereby rendered ever after un&s;u&s;ceptible of the &s;mall pox.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr. PEARSON's publication.</NOTE> It is worthy of remark that the infection of the cow-pox
<PB N="7" REF="039022_0006_10138AAC12097A38">can be conveyed to the human &s;pecies by the ordinary mode of inoculation. And it is ob&s;erved, that there is no difference in the effects of the matter taken from the cow, and of the matter generated &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in the &s;econd, third, fourth or fifth human creature.</P>
<P>SUCH are the outlines of a mild di&s;ea&s;e, the know|ledge of which may lead to con&s;equences of the utmo&s;t importance to the whole human race, no le&s;s indeed than that <HI>of &s;uperceding, if not extingui&s;hing, that terri|ble &s;courge, the &s;mall-pox.</HI></P>
<P>DR. EDWARD JENNER, is the phy&s;ician in England, who has collected and arranged a &s;eries of facts and experiments re&s;pecting the di&s;ea&s;e called there the <HI>cow-pox.</HI> His &s;hort work is commented on by Dr. GEORGE PEARSON, phy&s;ician to St. George's ho&s;pital, London.</P>
<P>THIS imperfect &s;ketch is thrown into the news-paper at this time, with a view of exciting the attention of our dairy farmers to &s;uch a di&s;temper among their cows. It may al&s;o be gratifying to &s;ome of the facul|ty of medicine, who, it is pre&s;umed, are not yet gen|erally informed of an <HI>epizootic</HI> di&s;ea&s;e, capable of be|ing communicated from the brute to the human kind, and which when communicated, is <HI>a certain &s;ecurity a|gain&s;t the &s;mall-pox.</HI> The public anxiety has been rou&s;ed of late, to &s;earch after the cau&s;e of a de&s;truct|ive

It is highly probable that &s;ome of the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing di&s;ea&s;es which afflict man|kind, have an <HI>animal</HI> origin; and time may prove, that &s;mall-pox, whooping-cough, and one kind of quincy, have like the hydrophobia, a &s;imilar &s;ource.</P>
<P><HI>Cambridge, March,</HI> 12, 1799.</P>
<P>THIS publication &s;hared the fate of mo&s;t others on new di&s;coveries. A few received it as a very impor|tant di&s;covery, highly intere&s;ting to humanity; &s;ome doubted it; others ob&s;erved that wi&s;e and prudent conduct, which allows them to condemn or applaud, as the event might prove; while a greater number ab|&s;olutely ridiculed it as one of tho&s;e medical whims which ari&s;e to-day and to-morrow are no more.</P>
<P>AT a meeting of the AMERICAN ACADEMY OF ARTS AND SCIENCES, held a few weeks after, in one of the rooms of this Univer&s;ity, I communicated what I knew of this novel di&s;temper, by exhibiting Dr. JEN|NER's beautiful publication, and recapitulating as ma|ny of the mo&s;t prominent parts of Dr. PEARSON's book as I could recollect, for I had lent and lo&s;t the work it&s;elf. The reception of this communication was
<PB N="9" REF="039022_0008_10138AAE58C64130">much to my &s;atisfaction, e&s;pecially with the ILLUSTRI|OUS PRESIDENT, who to a profound erudition in laws and politics, joins a no &s;mall knowledge in the &s;ci|ence of medicine<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Le&s;t this &s;hould ever be read beyond the bounds of this Con|tinent, it will not be &s;uperfluous to add here, that THE PRESI|DENT OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF ARTS AND SCIEN|CES IS JOHN ADAMS, PRESIDENT OF THESE UNITED STATES.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN this verbal communication was made, I promi&s;ed to prepare a memoir on the &s;ubject by the next quarterly meeting. But before that period ar|rived, Dr. WOODVILL's publication came to my hands, which I found &s;o entirely to the purpo&s;e, that I with|held my memoir, and pre&s;ented the Academy with the book it&s;elf, as containing a chain of experi|ments and facts, arranged in the form of a table, va&s;t|ly beyond what I could procure el&s;e where. This publication is entitled, "REPORTS <HI>of a &s;eries of in|oculations for the</HI> VARIOLAE VACCINAE, or COW-POX, <HI>with remarks and ob&s;ervations on this di&s;ea&s;e, con&s;ider|ed as a &s;ub&s;titute for the &s;mall-pox,</HI> by WILLIAM WOOD|VILLE, M. D. <HI>Phy&s;ician to the &s;mall-pox and Inoculat|ing Ho&s;pitals in the city of</HI> London."</P>
<P>THIS work I found contained ju&s;t what I wi&s;hed, a &s;eries of experiments, conducted by a learned phy|&s;ician,
<PB N="10" REF="039022_0009_10138A82182BAAF8">long conver&s;ant with the ca&s;ual and inoculated &s;mall-pox, in the large&s;t city in the world. The pub|lication bore an additional weight from the opinion given me by Dr. HAYGARTH of the book and of its au|thor; there being no man now on the &s;tage more tho|roughly acquainted with the laws of contagion than Dr. HAYGARTH. From this publication of Dr. WOOD|VILL's, was formed, in a great mea&s;ure, my &s;econd com|munication, which I made, like the fir&s;t, through the medium of a news-paper. It is this which follows:</P>
<P>COW-POX.</P>
<P>THE curio&s;ity of the public has been excited by a newly di&s;covered di&s;ea&s;e, denominated from its origin, the cow-pox, an account of which I &s;ent you la&s;t March. By the hi&s;tory then given, it appeared that this cow-pox pretty exactly re&s;embles the very milde&s;t &s;mall-pox from inoculation; that none had ever died of it, whether man or bea&s;t; and that tho&s;e who had undergone the cow-pox, were EVER AFTER SECURED FROM THE SMALL-POX, <HI>be they ever &s;o much expo&s;ed to the effluvium of it, or ever &s;o much ripe matter in&s;erted into the &s;kin by inoculation</HI>; or in other words, that tho&s;e per&s;ons who had undergone the local di&s;ea&s;e and &s;pecific fever occa&s;ioned by the cow-pox infection, <HI>are thereby rendered ever after un|&s;u&s;ceptible of the &s;mall-pox.</HI> Many parents are doubt|le&s;s
<PB N="11" REF="039022_0010_10138AB1F192DF48">anxious to know if the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions are ju&s;tified by &s;ub&s;equent experiments, and &s;ub&s;tantiated by a well connected chain of facts. I now &s;end you what infor|mation I have gathered from my corre&s;pondents in England, and from various publications, e&s;pecially from one by Dr. WOODVILLE, on this all important &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Dr. WOODVILLE is phy&s;ician to the &s;mall-pox and inoculating ho&s;pitals in the city of London. It &s;eems, that finding by Dr. JENNER's original publication, that no fatal effects had ever been known to follow from the cow-pox, and that it left the con&s;titution in a &s;tate of perfect &s;ecurity from the infection of the &s;mall-pox, Dr. WOODVILLE became very anxious to try the effects of inoculating the matter of this new and &s;ingular di&s;ea&s;e; and as trials could be made not only with &s;afety, but al&s;o with a pro&s;pect to advan|tage, he conceived it to be a duty that he owed the public in his official &s;ituation at the <HI>inoculating ho&s;pital,</HI> to embrace the fir&s;t opportunity of carrying the plan into execution.</P>
<P>HE found the di&s;ea&s;e at a cow-hou&s;e in Gray's Inn Lane, where there were about 200 cows kept. One of the milkers, named SARAH RICE, had &s;o perfect a &s;pecimen of the di&s;temper on her hands, that Dr.
<PB N="12" REF="039022_0011_10138A84A62B7C00">WOODVILLE entertained no doubt of its being the genuine cow-pox. It very much re&s;embled the re|pre&s;entation given in the fir&s;t plate of Dr. JENNER's publication. Dr. WOODVILLE, therefore, in Janua|ry la&s;t, went to that cow-hou&s;e, in company with Lord SOMERVILLE, Sir JOSEPH BANKS, Sir WILLIAM WATSON, Drs. SIMMONS, PEARSON, WELLAN, and o|thers, and took &s;ome of the purulent matter from the teats of the cow, and from SARAH RICE, with which he immediately inoculated &s;even children, by &s;cratch|ing the &s;kin with the point of a lancet till the in&s;tru|ment became tinged with blood. In the cour&s;e of three months, Dr. WOODVILLE inoculated two hun|dred, who&s;e ca&s;es he has given in his pamphlet. By the month of May, he had inoculated obout &s;ix hun|dred, and has exhibited the re&s;ult as it regarded the number of pu&s;tles, days of illne&s;s, &amp;c. in the form of a table. Nearly all tho&s;e per&s;ons <HI>were afterwards inoculated with matter of &s;mall-pox, or el&s;e expo&s;ed to the infection of it in the &s;mall-pox ho&s;pital, without the lea&s;t &s;igns of the di&s;ea&s;e.</HI> The Dr. then points out where the&s;e two di&s;ea&s;es agree, and in what they differ. The cow-pox, he ob&s;erves, in every ca&s;e with which we are as yet acquainted, has been introduced into the human con&s;titution through the medium of <HI>external local inflammation,</HI> and is therefore to be con&s;idered as
<PB N="13" REF="039022_0012_10138AB38CDA92B8">an <HI>inoculated di&s;ea&s;e</HI>; for there are no clear in&s;tances of its being received by effluvia, as is the &s;mall-pox; neverthele&s;s its virus &s;eems to affect a &s;imilar mode of action, and to be governed by the &s;ame laws. Thus, if a per&s;on be inoculated alternately with the &s;mall-pox matter, and that of the cow-pox every day, till fever is excited, all the inoculations make a pro|gre&s;s; and as &s;oon as the whole &s;y&s;tem becomes di&s;or|dered, they appear to be all equally advanced in mu|turation. It is to be remembered, that the local tu|mor excited from the inoculation of the cow-pox, is commonly of a different appearance from that which is the con&s;equence of the inoculation with variolous matter. The fluid formed in the cow-pox tumor ve|ry rarely becomes puriform, and the &s;cabs which &s;uc|ceed are of a harder texture, and exhibit a &s;moother &s;urface than the &s;mall-pox.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr.WOODVILL's publication.</NOTE></P>
<P>IT is evident from Dr. WOODVILLE's publication, that the matter of the cow-pox has generally produc|ed <HI>much fewer pu&s;tles and le&s;s indi&s;po&s;ition,</HI> than that from the inoculated &s;mall-pox; for it appears from his &s;ummary or table, that about two fifths of all the per&s;ons inoculated for the cow-pox, <HI>had no pu&s;tles at all,</HI> and that in not more than a fourth part of them <HI>was there experienced a perceptible di&s;order.</HI> But it
<PB N="14" REF="039022_0013_10138A871FF847C8">mu&s;t at the &s;ame time be acknowledged, &s;ays Dr. WOODVILLE, that in &s;everal in&s;tances, the cow-pox has proved a very &s;evere di&s;ea&s;e. Some had 200, &s;ome 300, and &s;ome 500, and two had 1000 pu&s;tles. One infant at the brea&s;t died on the eleventh day af|ter the cow-pox matter had been in&s;erted into its arm. In this &s;olitary fatal ca&s;e, the local tumor was very &s;light, and the eruptive &s;ymptoms took place on the &s;eventh day, when the child was &s;eized with convul|&s;ion fits, which carried it off. The pu&s;tles were from 80 to 100. Can we, however, be certain it died in con&s;equence of inoculation? Finally, the in&s;tances which have been brought forward to prove, that tho&s;e who have undergone the cow-pox, re&s;i&s;ted the infect|ion of the &s;mall-pox, are <HI>unquestionable</HI> and <HI>decisive,</HI> and &s;ufficiently numerous to e&s;tabli&s;h that important fact. This circum&s;tance, then, &s;ays Dr. WOODVILLE, appears to be as much a general law of the &s;y&s;tem, as that a per&s;on having had the &s;mall-pox is thereby ren|dered un&s;u&s;ceptible of receiving the di&s;ea&s;e a &s;econd time. For all the patients, &s;ays he, whom I have in|oculated with variolous matter, after they had pa&s;&s;ed through the cow-pox, none were affected with the &s;mall-pox; and it may be remarked, that nearly a fourth part were &s;o &s;lightly affected with the cow-pox, that it neither produced any perceptible indi&s;po&s;i|tion nor pu&s;tles.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="039022_0014_10138AB7ABB1A370">I HAVE thought it not improper to throw thus much before the public at this time. We live in the &s;crutinizing aera of experiment, and we cannot doubt but our brethren in England, will pur&s;ue this important &s;ubject with an indefatigability, character|i&s;tic of the nation, and produce a &s;till longer chain of facts, which &s;eems ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary before we can all unite in the re&s;olution to di&s;card the inocula|tion of the &s;mall-pox, and adopt that of the cow.</P>
<P>B. WATERHOUSE.</P>
<P>Cambridge, Nov. 15, 1799.</P>
<P>I NOW found that the brief hi&s;tory which I had given of the origin and progre&s;s of this di&s;ea&s;e made a favorable impre&s;&s;ion on the minds of the people; for the dread of that terrible &s;courge the &s;mall-pox is &s;till great in America, e&s;pecially in New-England, as is &s;ufficiently obvious by the numerous laws and regu|lations for preventing its contagion, and which are all de&s;cribed in my letter to Dr. HAYGARTH, printed in London in the year 1782, and glanced at in &s;everal &s;ub&s;equent letters to be found in that gentlemans' "<HI>&s;ketch of a plan to exterminate the ca&s;ual &s;mall-pox from Great-Britain, printed at Warrington in</HI> 1792, <HI>and dedicated, by permi&s;&s;ion, to the</HI> KING."</P>
<P>PERCEIVING that this di&s;ea&s;e began to excite a &s;pi|rit of enquiry among our literary men, I deemed it of
<PB N="16" REF="039022_0015_10138A898F853C70">importance to collect and examine every thing that had or might be publi&s;hed on the &s;ubject, and to ac|quire, from my corre&s;pondents in England, every in|formation re&s;pecting a di&s;temper &s;o intere&s;ting to hu|manity.</P>
<P>As the great que&s;tion which the profe&s;&s;ional public were anxious to have re&s;olved was, <HI>whether a per&s;on who had been fairly infected with the genuine</HI> cow <HI>or</HI> KINE-POX, <HI>were thereby &s;ecured again&s;t the &s;mall-pox,</HI> I bent all my enquiries to a&s;certain this point.</P>
<P>IT would be &s;uperfluous to mention every que&s;tion I put, and tedious to relate the different an&s;wers re|ceived. Suffice it for the pre&s;ent to &s;ay, that I made my enquiries of phy&s;icians living in different parts of Great-Britain, and of tho&s;e too who were the lea&s;t &s;anguine, although mo&s;t intere&s;ted in the event; of men, who objected much, and believed &s;lowly, yet have in the end become its mo&s;t potent advocates. And I do now deliberately declare, that I have re|ceived a croud of evidence in confirmation of the doctrine, "that the cow, or kine-pox renders the hu|man frame un&s;u&s;ceptible of the &s;mall-pox", too great to be re&s;i&s;ted by any mind not perverted by preju|dice.

<PB N="17" REF="039022_0016_10138ABA4A971710">gave way to &s;tubborn facts. The con&s;equence has been, that THIRTY THOUSAND per&s;ons, from two weeks old and upwards, have pa&s;&s;ed &s;afely through the di&s;|ea&s;e.

<P>BUT di&s;tance of &s;pace operates on &s;ome minds like di&s;tance of time. People are not &s;o ready to believe what happened a great while ago, or a great way off.

<P>UNDER a &s;erious impre&s;&s;ion of effecting a public benefit, and conceiving it, moreover, a duty in my offi|cial &s;ituation in this Univer&s;ity, I &s;ent to England for &s;ome of the <HI>vaccine</HI> or <HI>cow-pox-matter</HI> for trial. After &s;everal fruitle&s;s attempts, I obtained &s;ome by a &s;hort pa&s;&s;age from Bri&s;tol, and with it I inoculated all the younger part of my family.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t of my children that I inoculated, was a boy of five years old, named DANIEL OLIVER WA|TERHOUSE. I made a &s;light inci&s;ion in the u&s;ual place for inoculation in the arm, in&s;erted a &s;mall por|tion of the infected thread, and covered it with a &s;tick|ing-pla&s;ter. It exhibited no other appearances than what would have ari&s;en from any other extraneous &s;ub&s;tance, until the 6th day, when an encrea&s;ed red|ne&s;s called forth my attention. On the 8th, he com|plained of pain under the inoculated arm, and on the 9th, the inoculated part exhibited evident &s;igns of vi|rulency.
<PB N="19" REF="039022_0018_10138ABCD415F7C0">By the 10th, any one, much experienced in the inoculated &s;mall-pox, would have pronounced the arm infected. The pain and &s;welling under his arm went on gradually encrea&s;ing, and by the 11th day from inoculation, his febrile &s;ymptoms were pretty &s;trongly marked. The &s;ore in the arm proceeded ex|actly as Drs. JENNER and WOODVILLE de&s;cribe, and appeared to the eye very like the &s;econd plate in Dr. JENNER's elegant publication. In &s;hort, the appear|ance and &s;ymptoms of this di&s;ea&s;e, in the <HI>old</HI> world, and in the <HI>new,</HI> were more completely alike than I ex|pected. From the difference of &s;ituation, greater dryne&s;s of our atmo&s;phere, and extraordinary heat of the weather, (from 88. to 96. of Farht.) I did expect a greater variation.</P>
<P>THE inoculated part in this boy, was &s;urrounded by an efflore&s;cence which extended from his &s;houlder to his elbow, which made it nece&s;&s;ary to apply &s;ome remedies to le&s;&s;en it; but the "<HI>&s;ymptoms,</HI>" as they are called, &s;carcely drew him from his play more than an hour or two; and he went through the di&s;ea&s;e in &s;o light a manner, as hardly ever to expre&s;s any marks of peevi&s;hne&s;s. A piece of true &s;kin was fairly taken out of the arm by the <HI>virus,</HI> the part appearing as if eaten out by a cau&s;tic, <HI>a never failing &s;ign of thorough &s;ection of the &s;y&s;tem in the inoculated &s;mall-pox.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="039022_0019_10138A8F49A68CF0">SATISFIED with the appearances and &s;ymptoms in this boy, I inoculated another of three years of age, with matter taken from his brother's arm, for he had no pu&s;tles on his body. He likewi&s;e went through the di&s;ea&s;e in a perfect and very &s;atisfactory manner. This child pur&s;ued his amu&s;ements with as little in|terruption as his brother. Then I inoculated a &s;er|vant boy of about 12 years of age, with &s;ome of the infected thread from England. His arm was pretty &s;ore, and his "<HI>&s;ymptoms</HI>" pretty &s;evere. He treated him&s;elf rather har&s;hly by exerci&s;ing unnece&s;&s;arily in the garden, when the weather was extremely hot (Farht. Thermr. 96, in the &s;hade!) and then wa&s;hing his head and upper parts of his body under the pump, and &s;etting, in &s;hort, all rules at defiance, in my ab|&s;ence. Neverthele&s;s, this boy went through the di&s;|order without any other accident than a &s;ore throat and a &s;tiffne&s;s of the mu&s;cles of the neck, all which &s;oon vani&s;hed by the help of a few remedies.</P>
<P>BEING obliged to go from home a few days, I re|que&s;ted my colleague Dr. WARREN, to vi&s;it the&s;e children. Dr. DANFORTH, as well as &s;ome other phy|&s;icians, came from Bo&s;ton out of curio&s;ity, and &s;o did &s;everal practitioners from the country. I mention this, becau&s;e it gave ri&s;e to a groundle&s;s report, that one of the children had &s;o bad an arm that I
<PB N="21" REF="039022_0020_10138ABFC2966A20">thought it prudent to take the advice of &s;ome of my brethren upon it.</P>
<P>FROM a full maturated pu&s;tle in my little boy of three years old, I inoculated his infant &s;i&s;ter, already weaned, of one year. At the &s;ame time, and from the &s;ame pu&s;tle, I inoculated its nur&s;ery maid. They both went through the di&s;ea&s;e with equal regularity. As this woman was the fir&s;t adult per&s;on on whom I had performed the operation, I was more con&s;tant in my enquiries, and more careful to note &s;ymptoms as they aro&s;e. They were very &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the lighter kind from inoculation for the &s;mall-pox, viz. a &s;light dizzine&s;s and nau&s;ea, watery eyes, chilline&s;s, &s;orene&s;s of the fle&s;h, u&s;ually called by the common people in this country, "<HI>bones'-ache</HI>", a general la&s;&s;i|tude, tran&s;ient pains in the region of the &s;tomach, loins and head, with a di&s;inclination to animal food and exerci&s;e; yet none of the&s;e &s;ymptoms were &s;o oppre&s;&s;ive as to dimini&s;h for a moment her attention to her little charge, who&s;e &s;ymptoms, we conjectured, kept pace with tho&s;e of its nur&s;e.</P>
<P>THIS &s;triking &s;imilarity of &s;ymptoms has induced &s;ome practitioners in this country, as well as &s;ome phy&s;icians in Great-Britain, to conclude, that the <HI>kine-pox</HI> was only a variety of the &s;mall-pox. We
<PB N="22" REF="039022_0021_10138A90D4613190">confe&s;s they appear to be near a kin; yet &s;ome circum|&s;tances lead us to conclude them &s;pecifically different; for example, we can communicate the vaccine poi|&s;on to any cow by inoculation, but we cannot give her by any method the &s;mall-pox. This is not, how|ever, peculiar to the cow&mdash;It is true of every other brute on which the trial has been made; without which provi&s;ion in nature, the whole human race might again &s;uffer under this terrific &s;courge!</P>
<P>I ATTEMPTED to inoculate two more of our female dome&s;tics, but failed, owing probably to u&s;ing a new method recommended by an eminent &s;urgeon in Lon|don, which was, to pa&s;s a needle with an infected thread through the &s;kin, &s;o as to leave the thread in. This, it is probable, underwent an alteration &s;imilar to what happens in the operation of <HI>wire-drawing,</HI> where mo&s;t of the oil and &s;ome of the metal are left behind. Then I performed the operation on four gentlemen, one of them a phy&s;ician, who&s;e &s;ymptoms were &s;o nearly a|like what I have already related, that I find nothing new to add, excepting that one of them cho&s;e to live pretty freely by way of experiment, and who&s;e febrile &s;ymptoms, e&s;pecially the head-ache, were full as much as he could bear and walk about. This convinced me that the <HI>Kine-pox</HI> was a di&s;ea&s;e not to be trifled with.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, <DATE>AUG. 2d, 1800</DATE>.</DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR DOCTOR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have doubtle&s;s heard of the newly di&s;crib|ed di&s;order, known in England by the name of the <HI>cow-pox,</HI> which &s;o nearly re&s;embles the &s;mall-pox, that it is now agreed in Great-Britain, that the former will pa&s;s for the latter.</P>
<P>I HAVE collected every thing that has been printed, and all the information I could procure from my cor|re&s;pondents, re&s;pecting this di&s;temper, and have been &s;o thoroughly convinced of its importance to humani|ty, that I have procured &s;ome of the vaccine matter, and
<PB N="24" REF="039022_0023_10138A934A656850">therewith inoculated &s;even of my family. The inocu|lation has proceeded in &s;ix of them exactly as de&s;crib|ed by WOODVILLE and JENNER; but my de&s;ire is to confirm the doctrine by having &s;ome of them inocu|lated by you.</P>
<P>I CAN obtain variolous matter, and inoculate them privately, but I wi&s;h to do it in the mo&s;t open and public way po&s;&s;ible. As I have imported a new di&s;|temper, I conceive that the public have a right to know exactly every &s;tep I take in it. I write this, therefore, to enquire whether you will, on philanthrop|ic principles, try the experiment of inoculating &s;ome of my children who have already undergone the cow-pox. If you accede to my propo&s;al, I &s;hall con&s;ider it as an experiment in which we have co-operated for the good of our fellow-citizens, and relate it as &s;uch in the pamplet I mean to publi&s;h on the &s;ubject.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>To this letter the Dr. returned a polite an&s;wer, a&s;|&s;uring me of his readine&s;s to give any a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his power, to a&s;certain <HI>whether the cow-pox would pre|vent the &s;mall-pox</HI>; ob&s;erving, that he had at that
<PB N="25" REF="039022_0024_10138AC53929F8E0">time fre&s;h matter that he could depend on, and de|&s;iring me to &s;end the children to the ho&s;pital for that purpo&s;e. Of the three which I offered, the Dr. cho&s;e to try the experiment on the boy of 12 years of age, mentioned in page 20, whom he inoculated in my pre|&s;ence by two punctures, and with matter taken that moment from a patient who had it pretty full upon him. He at the &s;ame time, in&s;erted an infected thread, and then put him into the ho&s;pital, where was one pa|tient with it the natural way. On the 4th day, the Dr. pronounced the <HI>arm</HI> to be infected. It became every hour &s;orer, but in a day or two it dried off, and grew well, without producing the &s;lighte&s;t trace of a di&s;ea&s;e; &s;o that the boy was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the ho&s;|pital and returned home the 12th day after the expe|riment. ONE FACT, in &s;uch ca&s;es, is worth a thou&s;and arguments.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Five more of my family, including three of my children, are now in Dr. ASPINWALL's ho&s;pital.</NOTE></P>
<P>IT is proper to mention, that there are &s;ome cir|cum&s;tances, which if not attended to critically, may bring the inoculation of this recently imported di&s;tem|per into a temporary di&s;repute. Dr. JENNER, aware of &s;uch an accident, has pointed out the fallacious &s;ources whence a di&s;ea&s;e imitative of the <HI>variolae vac|cinae,</HI> or <HI>kine-pox,</HI> may ari&s;e, with a view of prevent|ing a &s;purious di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="039022_0025_10138A9608ADFC20">Of the &s;ources of &s;purious cow-pox, he enumerates,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t&mdash;That ari&s;ing from pu&s;tules on the nipples, or udder of the cow, which pu&s;tles contain no &s;pecific virus.</P>
<P N="2">2dly&mdash;From matter, (although originally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the &s;pecific virus,) which has &s;uffered a decompo&s;ition, either from putrefaction, or from any other cau&s;e le&s;s obvious to the &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P N="3">3dly&mdash;From matter taken from an ulcer in <HI>an ad|vanced &s;tage,</HI> which ulcer aro&s;e from a true cow-pox.</P>
<P>HE then gives a &s;triking in&s;tance, where a practi|tioner was under the nece&s;&s;ity of taking &s;ome &s;mall-pox-matter from a pu&s;tule, which experience &s;ince proved, was <HI>advanced too far</HI> to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e intended, and &s;ays that the &s;ame may happen in the cow-pox.</P>
<P>HE next &s;hews, that when the inoculated part has degenerated into an ulcer, the matter, although it may po&s;&s;e&s;s the power of inflaming the patient's arm, is neverthele&s;s, void of that &s;pecific virus requi&s;ite to produce the genuine di&s;ea&s;e; and of cour&s;e, incapa|ble of &s;ecuring the human &s;y&s;tem again&s;t the &s;mall-pox.</P>
<P>HE doubts whether <HI>pure pus,</HI> though contained in a &s;mall-pox pu&s;tule, is ever capable of producing the &s;mall-pox perfectly.
<Q>I have often been foiled, &s;ays
<PB N="27" REF="039022_0026_10138AC7C34B6628">Dr. JENNER, in my endeavours to communicate the cow-pox by inoculation. An inflammation will &s;ometimes &s;ucceeds the &s;cratch or puncture, and in a few days di&s;appears without producing any further effect. Sometimes it will even produce an ichorous fluid, and yet the <HI>&s;y&s;tem</HI> will not be affected. The &s;ame thing, we know, happens in the &s;mall-pox.</Q></P>
<P>THREE of four in&s;tances of the kind are recorded to have happened in England. The children were in|oculated for the &s;mall-pox, and took the di&s;order. The oppo&s;ers to the introduction of the kine-pox have <HI>uncandidly</HI> adduced the&s;e in&s;tances, and they have been repeated in this country, without any explanation, by &s;ome who were capable of explaining them.</P>
<P>ANOTHER circum&s;tance, tending to di&s;credit the idea of di&s;carding the &s;mall-pox and &s;ub&s;tituting the kine-pox, is <HI>mixing the two di&s;ea&s;es together, and perhaps giv|ing one for the other,</HI> as we pre&s;ume was done in &s;ome of the ho&s;pitals in London. A phy&s;ician of the fir&s;t rank, wrote thus to the author, in Feb. 1799.
<Q>Dr. W. tells me, that he finds the cow-pox a more &s;e|rious di&s;ea&s;e than was at fir&s;t imagined; and con|&s;idering the &s;afety of inoculation, (for &s;mall-pox), and the danger of introducing a new di&s;ea&s;e into the human frame, probably the practice will not in|crea&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="039022_0027_10138A99598226C0">IT was ju&s;t about the &s;ame time, that Dr. SIMS wrote the letter referred to in page 33, &s;o that the flat|tering pro&s;pect of bani&s;hing the &s;mall-pox forever from Great-Britain, &s;eemed to be ob&s;cured for &s;everal weeks. But Dr. JENNER, and Mr. R&mdash;, a very di&s;|tingui&s;hed &s;urgeon and native of the county where the cow-pox fir&s;t appeared, undertook to examine how it happened that a di&s;temper &s;o mild in Gloce&s;ter&s;hire, &s;hould be converted into a pretty &s;evere di&s;ea&s;e in London. This matter was unravelled, and the end of it appeared to be this: The fir&s;t &s;ubjects inoculated for the kine-pox, were chiefly people maintained as <HI>poor.</HI> They were inoculated at the &s;mall-pox ho&s;pi|pitals, and &s;everal of them for both kinds, &s;mall-pox and kine-pox at the &s;ame time, or at an interval of a day or two, by way of experiment; and it is more than probable, &s;ays one of my corre&s;pondents, that a lancet infected with variolous matter, was u&s;ed for in|oculating for the kine-pox. Be that as it may, it is certain that the patients of a celebrated inoculator, had the di&s;ea&s;e with greater &s;everity than any other practitioner. In general, the patients had more fever, &s;orer arms, and more pu&s;tules in London, than in the country.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It may be nece&s;&s;ary to inform &s;ome of our readers, that the people of England call every part of their I&s;land "THE COUN|TRY" out of London; that city being called, by way of pre|eminence, "THE TOWN."</NOTE> Tho&s;e of the authors friends who have

<P>AFTER this &s;ucce&s;sful inve&s;tigation, inoculation for the kine-pox went on with redoubled activity; in&s;o|much, that from the date of Dr. SIMS' letter, to May following, (ju&s;t about a year) 29,400 per&s;ons of all ages, pa&s;&s;ed through the di&s;ea&s;e WITHOUT A SINGLE DEATH!</P>

<P>THERE is another circum&s;tance of very great mo|ment to &s;ome families, I mean tho&s;e in which the &s;mall-pox <HI>always proves fatal, even under inoculation.</HI> But this can be be&s;t enforced and illu&s;trated by the letter of Mr.WALKER, an eminent engraver in Lon|don, addre&s;&s;ed to the editors of the MEDICAL AND PHYSICAL JOURNAL, accompanied with a coloured en|graving, repre&s;enting the di&s;order in the arm through all its different &s;tages.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vol. 1. p. 118.</NOTE></P>
<P>"HAVING a &s;on between ten and eleven months old, and the &s;mall-pox being in my oppo&s;ite, as well as my next neighbour's family, I conceived it &s;o unlikely for my infant to e&s;cape the contagion, and having heard of the benign tendency and mildne&s;s of

<Q>The preceding communication on &s;o intere&s;ting a &s;ubject, we con&s;ider as peculiar|ly valuable, as Mr. WALKER not only &s;hews a mind &s;ufficiently enlightened to give a fair trial to a new method of conquering one of the mo&s;t dreadful &s;courges to mankind, but from his profe&s;&s;ional abilities, al&s;o enables us to exhibit the progre&s;&s;ive appearances of the cow-pox.</Q>
See Med. and Phys. Journal, vol. 1&s;t. p. 120.</P>
<P>HAVING adduced thus much in favor of this newly
<PB N="33" REF="039022_0032_10138ACFAC9325E8">de&s;cribed di&s;temper, it is agreeable to the candor we profe&s;s, to inform the reader, that one phy&s;ician of eminence, and but one in London, has written a let|ter rather again&s;t the practice; I mean Dr. JOHN SIMS. It is grounded on an extract of a letter from "an intelligent gentleman, not of the profe&s;&s;ion," &s;aying that "there is a gentleman of eminence in the law who has had the cow-pox twice, which he caught by milk|ing his father's cows when a lad. This gentleman was afterwards inoculated for the &s;mall-pox, and had it in &s;o great abundance that his life was di&s;paired of. "He de&s;cribes the cow-pox as the mo&s;t loath&s;ome of di&s;ea&s;es, and adds, that his right arm was in a &s;tate of eruption, both the fir&s;t and &s;econd time, from one ex|tremity to the other; the pain was exce&s;&s;ive, and his fingers &s;o &s;tiff, he could &s;carcely move them."&mdash; Nay, he &s;peaks of the "abhorrence the di&s;ea&s;e created in the family." Had this gentleman been of the med|ical profe&s;&s;ion, he would have known, at once, that this was not the cow-pox, but an ulceration, &s;imilar to what Dr. JENNER mentions in p. 8. &amp; 9. of his 2d part. If this was the cow-pox, it was very different from any ever &s;een &s;ince. It appears pretty clearly, that this gentleman, eminent in the law, was under a mi&s;take. Dr. SIM's communication is dated Feb. 13th, 1799, and may be &s;een in the 1&s;t vol. of the MEDICAL AND PHYSICAL JOURNAL In a &s;econd letter in the &s;ame
<PB N="34" REF="039022_0033_10138A9EF31AEE78">volume, which is explanatory and apologetical, he &s;ays, he had no intention of declaring him&s;elf an ene|my to the inoculation of this di&s;ea&s;e; that his only wi&s;h was, to induce the practitioners to par&s;e a little, to obtain more decided experience of its utility, be|fore it &s;hould be generally recommended. This let|ter is dated April 20th, 1799, &s;ince which, <HI>decided ex|perience of its utility has been obtained,</HI> and Dr. SIMS is now among the firm advocates for the operation. The reader, however, is entreated to peru&s;e the&s;e two let|ters, becau&s;e they have been quoted by &s;ome who did not advert to their being written at &s;o early a period of the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Dr. MOSELY has rai&s;ed &s;ome objections to the prac|tice; but it would be unkind to repeat them at this time. We have glanced at &s;ome of his notions in the note at the bottom of our fir&s;t page. One idea of his, however, we cannot pa&s;s over, becau&s;e that too has been repeated among us. Coming cloathed in the garb of prudence, we mu&s;t not treat it but re&s;pecfully. We allow, &s;ay they, that the kine-pox &s;ecures the con&s;ti|tution from the &s;mall-pox for a &s;hort time, becau&s;e that has been proved; but how do we know it will &s;e|cure it for a length of time. Dr. MOSELY, &s;ays Mr. Mr. RING,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Med. and Phys. Journal, vol. 2d, p. 25.</NOTE> expre&s;&s;es a <HI>&s;u&s;picion,</HI> that the cow-pox
<PB N="35" REF="039022_0034_10138AD42C3A47E8">can only render the habit un&s;u&s;ceptible of the &s;mall-pox "<HI>for a time.</HI>" "This, ob&s;erves Mr. R. is refut|ed by volumes of evidence, and a cloud of witne&s;&s;es." Per&s;ons who repeat this &s;u&s;picion of Dr. MOSELY, &s;hould be informed of the number now living in the we&s;tern counties of England, who have had the di&s;ea&s;e from milking cows in the early part of life, and who have re&s;i&s;ted every attempt to communicate the &s;mall-pox to them after the lap&s;e of 15, 20, 30, and even 50 years and upwards. See the ca&s;e of SARAH PORT|LOCK, who was inoculated ineffectually for the &s;mall-pox <HI>twenty-&s;even</HI> years after receiving the infection of the kine-pox from milking cows; of MARY BARGE, <HI>thirty-one</HI> years; of ELIZABETH WYNNE, <HI>thirty-eight</HI> years, and above all, of JOHN PHILLIPS, FIFTY-THREE years after. See al&s;o, &s;everal ca&s;es in the 1&s;t and 2d volumes of the Med. &amp; Phys. Journal.</P>
<P>THIS was one of the mo&s;t formidable objections made again&s;t inoculation for the &s;mall-pox, when fir&s;t practi&s;ed by Dr. BOYLSTON in Bo&s;ton, in 1721. Yet the long experience of <HI>eighty years</HI> has now effectually removed every &s;u&s;picion of the kind.</P>
<P>ALTHOUGH the inoculation for the cow-pox was not received in England, without a degree of caution be|coming an enlightened age and people, yet it may be a&s;&s;erted with truth, that nothing has occurred in the
<PB N="36" REF="039022_0035_10138AA273DB7B70">annals of medicine, which has been taken up more ge|nerally, received more candidly, or conducted more prudently. And it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, that we Ame|ricans &s;hall give it a le&s;s candid reception, or exam|ine it le&s;s ingenuou&s;ly.</P>
<P>THE people of New-England, particularly of Bo&s;|ton, &s;et a noble example to their elder brethren of Old-England, in adopting the Turki&s;h practice of in|oculation for the &s;mall-pox, in 1721. Now, the Eng|li&s;h, in their turn, lead the way in a practice &s;till more &s;alutiferous. For, although the inoculation which commenced here in 1721, &s;tripped that horrid di&s;ea&s;e, the &s;mall-pox, of more than half its terrors, yet it is the <HI>kine-pox</HI> that will effect its extermination. If, there|fore, it be found that the latter is every way an ea&s;ier, &s;afer and more plea&s;ant di&s;temper, and a perfect &s;ecu|rity again&s;t the former, do not humanity, regard to our country, the dictates of rea&s;on, and the precepts of religion, urge us all to unite our efforts to exterminate "a di&s;ea&s;e, which has, during the la&s;t thou&s;and years, de&s;troyed full a tenth, and probably a larger propor|tion, of the human race." To effect &s;o de&s;irable a purpo&s;e, I have laboured to collect all the evidence on this important &s;ubject, and to lay it before the Ameri|can public, in &s;o plain and &s;imple a manner, as to re|quire no other preparation for its admi&s;&s;ion than com|mon &s;en&s;e and an unprejudiced mind.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="replies">
<HEAD>MY PROFESSIONAL ENGAGEMENTS, PARTICULARLY AT THIS SEASON, IN THE UNIVERSITY, RENDERED IT CONVENIENT TO INSERT IN THE NEWS-PAPER THE FOLLOWING GENERAL ANSWER TO A NUMBER OF QUERIES PUT TO ME BY LETTER, AND OTHERWISE, RESPECTING THE NATURE AND INOCULATION OF THE KINE-POX.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1&s;t. RESPECTING its contagion. It appears, by all the ob&s;ervations and experiments hitherto made pub|lic, that the di&s;ea&s;e is not contagious or catching from one per&s;on to another. Even the cows do not take it of each other, if an open rail-fence be interpo&s;ed between them. Dr. W's. children labouring under the di&s;or|der, &s;lept through the whole cour&s;e of it with tho&s;e not then inoculated for it. "It does not &s;eem po&s;&s;ible, (says Dr. JENNER,) for the contagious matter to pro|duce the di&s;ea&s;e from effluvia, or by any other means than contact; <HI>&s;o that a &s;ingle individual in a family might at any time receive it without the ri&s;k of infecting the re&s;t, or of &s;preading a di&s;temper that fills a country with error.</HI>"</P>
<P N="2">2d. RESPECTING diet previous to receiving the di&s;|ea&s;e. Dr. W. had rather inoculate per&s;ons in the <HI>pleni|tude
<PB N="38" REF="039022_0037_10138AA671DD6568">of health,</HI> without the lea&s;t alteration of diet, or mode of living.</P>
<P N="3">3d. IT is difficult to an&s;wer the queries re&s;pecting the mildne&s;s or &s;everity of the di&s;order. Dr. WATER|HOUSE an&s;wers generally, that in a va&s;t majority of ca&s;es, it is incomparably milder than the inoculated &s;mall-pox, and it appears from experiments in Eng|land, that it has become milder as it progre&s;&s;ed. Thus according to Dr. WOODVILL's la&s;t report, out of 310 ca&s;es, only 39 had pu&s;tules that &s;uppurated; viz. out of the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> hundred 19 had pu&s;tules; out of the <HI>&s;e|cond</HI> 13; and out of the la&s;t 110 only 7 had pu&s;tules. There have been a few ca&s;es, however, where it has proved an heavy di&s;ea&s;e, the patient being burthened with between 1000 and 1500 pu&s;tules. It is pre&s;um|ed, that had &s;uch per&s;ons been inoculated for the &s;mall-pox, they would have died.</P>
<P N="4">4th. As to the be&s;t &s;ea&s;on for receiving the di&s;ea&s;e. In this region, the &s;ea&s;on preferred for inoculation of the kine-pox, as well as the &s;mall-pox, is from Au|gu&s;t to November; cooli&s;h nights and ripe fruit are plea&s;ant a&s;&s;i&s;tants to the inoculator. Very cold wea|ther is unfavorable to the kine-pox. It aggravated the &s;orene&s;s of the arm to that degree in England, that the inoculators were obliged to po&s;tpone their opera|tions until warmer weather. Cold, combined with dampne&s;s, is wor&s;t of all. About a dozen per&s;ons pa&s;&s;ed through the di&s;temper at Cambridge, when the weather was hotter than ever was known there &s;ince the u&s;e of thermometers.</P>
<P N="5">5th. To tho&s;e of the faculty who have applied to him by letter <HI>to &s;upply them with matter for inoculation</HI>&mdash; he would ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that as he has taken much
<PB N="39" REF="039022_0038_10138AD957640D68">pains in this bu&s;ine&s;s, run no &s;mall ri&s;k of reputation, as well as of per&s;onal feelings, there are <HI>few,</HI> he tru&s;ts, that will wonder he is anxious to have the matter un|der his own eye until the practice is more firmly e&s;|tabli&s;hed by the public opinion. Some un&s;ucce&s;sful ca&s;es at the beginning, deprived Scotland of the ble&s;|&s;ings of inoculation for the &s;mall-pox for <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> than 20 years. He hopes this idea will <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> ex|cu&s;e at pre&s;ent, even in the minds <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> pupils.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. W is happy to find that every GENTLEMAN of the fa|culty in Bo&s;ton and its vicinity, has under&s;tood this, and con|ducted accordingly.</NOTE></P>
<P>DR. WATERHOUSE informs tho&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> applied to him out of Cambridge, to inoculate their families, that he declined it only until the di&s;order had gone fairly through his own family, and until &s;ome of them had been inoculated by Dr. ASPINWALL, and other|wi&s;e expo&s;ed to the &s;mall-pox. But having now con|firmed his a&s;&s;ertion, <HI>that the kine-pox protects the con|&s;titution from the infection of the &s;mall-pox,</HI> by a fair ex|periment, he is ready to attend them whenever they choo&s;e. Tho&s;e who live in Bo&s;ton, may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that from the proximity of his re&s;idence to the capi|tal, he &s;hall make &s;uch arrangements as to be able to attend them as punctually as if he re&s;ided there.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH I am convinced that the KINE-POX is a &s;hort|er, &s;afer, and plea&s;anter di&s;ea&s;e than the inoculated &s;mall-pox even <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> in the mo&s;t fortunate manner, yet there is &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> conceiving too lightly of it. The inoculation of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> and &s;ixty per&s;ons of different ages and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">, has <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> that the KINE-POX requires &s;ome care on the part of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> well as attention on that of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">; and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> opinion, that an ab&s;tinance from animal food <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">mulating drinks, is as nece&s;&s;ary in the inocula|tion of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> as in that of the SMALL-pox. A few examples will illu&s;trate what I wi&s;h to convey. Two young gentlemen were rendered &s;omewhat uncomfortable for three or four days in con|&s;equence of eating and drinking as u&s;ual. One, the lea&s;t attentive to directions, after walking to, and from Bo&s;ton in A VERY HOT DAY, had his febrile &s;ymptoms very much aggravated. Has head|ache was excruciating, and a &s;light delirium came on in the even|ing, with a &s;tricture acro&s;s the region of the &s;tomach, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to what we &s;ometimes find in the ca&s;ual &s;mall-pox. Such imprudent conduct might have de&s;troyed him if inoculated for the &s;mall-pox. A boy, after eating green-corn, was crammed with fruit, under the ab&s;urd idea that RIPE FRUIT CAN HURT NO ONE, &s;o that with the &s;ymptoms of KINE-POX was joined a CHOLERA MORBUS. In a|nother boy, the MUMES appeared about the 4th day, and arre&s;ted the infection. I could add &s;ome other in&s;tances to prove that this new di&s;ea&s;e, mild and &s;afe as it is, requires more of the phy&s;ician than merely putting the matter into the arm; but as this treati&s;e is ad|dre&s;&s;ed not &s;o much to the PHYSICIAN, as to the COMMON SENSE of all, I purpo&s;ely avoid profe&s;&s;ional directions or critici&s;ms.</P>
