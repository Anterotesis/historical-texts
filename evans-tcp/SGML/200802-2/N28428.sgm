<P>Fortunate would I have deemed myself, to have met the late occasion with abilities and preparation worthy of its im|portance and sublimity. The most I could presume to look for, was merely indulgence.</P>
<P>I gratefully acknowledge the politeness of the Grand Lodge; and with profound deference receive the expression of their will, conveyed by "The Committee of Arrangement."</P>
<P>The sole difficulty with me, lies in a consciousness of the imperfection of so hurried a performance as mine, and the im|propriety there would be now, in attempting to improve it.</P>

<HEAD>AN ORATION, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Britain stretched out her arm beyond the bounds of law, America arose in|dignant, at the attempt; resisted and repelled the invasion of her rights; and by virtue, pa|triotism and valour, founded her liberty and independence. To guard these most effectu|ally&mdash;"To form a more perfect union, es|tablish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure happiness to us and our posterity;" she raised on the broad basis of reason and the rights of man, a su|perstructure supported by pillars of the first order; finished and adorned in the most ap|proved

architecture; the apartments beauti|fully arranged, well proportioned, elegant and accommodating;&mdash;the <HI>residence</HI> of liberty&mdash;the admiration of enlightened nations&mdash;the pro|tection and glory of this western world.</P>
<P>The grand master-builder, who principally prepared the ground, and carried up the edi|fice; who defended it from foreign assaults and domestic confusion; He, whose splendid orb so long illumined it&mdash;hath retired, and, alas! is gone forever&mdash;</P>
<P>Hence an awful silence&mdash;hence the pen|sive melancholy, which shadows every coun|tenance&mdash;the solemn gloom which reigns throughout the mansion: Hence, in compli|ance with the high, well-timed recommendation to the people of the United States, to assemble on this day for the purpose of expressing their gratitude for incalcula<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e services, and testify|ing their affliction for an irretrievable loss&mdash;the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania have entered

this sacred Temple<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Zion Church.</NOTE>. Their special relation to "the great Light departed," enhances the dig|nity of the recommendation, and marks this as a day pre-eminently to be regarded.</P>
<P>Much I wished, gentlemen, to have de|clined the appointment you were pleased to honour me with; from the extreme shortness of the notice; but especially from a conside|ration that has been well expressed by a cele|brated Athenian<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Pericles.</NOTE>. "Difficult indeed it is," says he, "to speak on a subject, where the hearer enlightened by a long acquaintance, and warm in his affections, may quickly pronounce every thing to be unfavourably expressed, in respect to what he <HI>wishes,</HI> and what he <HI>knows</HI> to be the truth."</P>
<P>With that diffidence which the observation as well as the subject itself naturally creates, and without pretensions to those talents which the occasion requires, I rise,&mdash;not expecting to describe in the glow of dignified eloquence,
<PB N="8" REF="037879_0006_100F6017E0BEE388">
those actions which excited admiration&mdash;those accomplishments, qualities and virtues, which made their possessor so much beloved; but merely as your instrument to carry on one part of the solemnities of this day designed to do honour to
<Q><L>The first of Heroes, Statesmen, best of men,</L>
<L>Whose like we ne'er shall look upon again.</L></Q></P>
<P>To render respect to characters illustrious for their public services, is becoming in every point of view. It results from a fair and just conception of things. It is a debt of gratitude, which it is favourable to the best interests of society, to pay. It renders virtue prominent, visible, lovely and beloved. It creates a pure, unblameable emulation. It diffuses public spi|rit. To great abilities it proves an incentive, to bring them into action: to the good and use|ful, whatever their degree, it intimates and yields encouragement. The most renowned

nations have at all times been sensible of this Hence hath the festive, and the funeral day been fixed;&mdash;the breathing ode, and eulogy pronounced;&mdash;the monument,&mdash;"the statue,&mdash; the devoted pile," erected&mdash;</P>
<P>Singularly expressive in this behalf, was the custom of the Egyptians, a people extreme|ly improved, as well as ancient: for, besides "celebrating the names and actions of their departed worthies, they embalmed their bodies, that they might long be kept in public view, as examples of virtue, and, altho' dead, yet speak|ing."</P>
<P>It is well known what attention the Master States of the world, Greece and Rome, in their most splendid periods, employed in celebrating distinguished actions and characters. It is in this way, we have become acquainted with a Solon, Aristides, Epaminondas, Phocian;&mdash;a Numa, Fabricius, Cincinnatus, Camillus,&mdash;and all those worthies who shine in the rolls of <HI>ho|nest</HI>

fame; the patrons of liberty, the conser|vators of justice, the friends of virtue, govern|ment and laws.</P>
<P>No less attentive will America be, in giving celebrity to, and sounding wide, the greatness of her favourite sons. Already in her record|ing page, we find described&mdash;and the descrip|tion shall brighten as it is handed down,&mdash;a Warren, Montgomery, Mercer, Green, Frank|lin; with an host of her heroes, statesmen, and sages; at whose names, every thing great, good, and amiable, rises to our view;&mdash;men, who successfully co-operated in achieving, rear|ing, and protecting, all that we deem excellent and worthy of our possessing;&mdash;before whose merit, the splendour of antiquity fades on our remembrance, and who have exalted claims on our gratitude and attention.</P>

grateful America, with the consenting plaudits of an admiring world, is he who will give re|nown to these United States, till time shall be no more, THE IMMORTAL WASHINGTON.</P>
<P>"First in war&mdash;first in peace&mdash;and first in the hearts of his countrymen," hath our whole nation announced him&mdash;afflicted and mourn|ing for his decease!</P>
<P>Responsive to this high annunciation, shall millions speak; and all the chief occurrences, and noted places through the land, make record, to the end of time.</P>
<P>Yes, "first in war"&mdash;shall his achievments great, thro' seven eventful years, fix and per|petuate his name&mdash;</P>
<P>Ye rivers majestic! Hudson&mdash;Delaware&mdash; Chesapeak&mdash;as long as ye continue to flow&mdash;and render your tributary waters to the vast Atlan|tic, bear witness ye shall to the exploits he hath accomplished in your view!</P>

<P>Him&mdash;First in peace,&mdash;these happy States, their spreading canvas&mdash;rising cities&mdash;advan|cing population, and all their prosperity declare.</P>
<P>Ye unhappy States of the world too, divi|ded by faction, corrupted by foreign influence, destroyed by foreign force;&mdash;your ruin, the <HI>con|trast</HI> to our felicity, appreciates the merit of his name.</P>
<P>And what else do those looks of affliction, those sable, shrouded places, shew; those tears&mdash;that general mourning throughout this land,&mdash;but that he was first in the veneration and affections of his countrymen?</P>
<P>If ever there was a person, to whom grati|tude was due for his services, and veneration to
<PB N="13" REF="037879_0011_100F6023DE102AC0">
be paid to his memory,&mdash;it is He, who is the sub|ject of our present attention, in whom is seen from first to last, a character sublime.</P>
<P>In earliest youth he gave uncommon presa|ges of rising excellence, and future fame. He was even then possessed of extraordinary ac|complishments both of body and mind:
<Q><L>A combination and a form indeed,</L>
<L>Where every virtue seemed to set its seal,</L>
<L>To give the world assurance of a Patriot.</L></Q></P>
<P>His person was graceful and majestic; his air and manner, engaging and impressive. His countenance portrayed the dignity of his soul. Before he arrived at age, he was intrusted with high national concerns. Just passing from that period,&mdash;see the young Hero discharging a vete|ran part; conducting exploits of military prow|ess with intrepidity and success; encountering a savage foe, with enterprise most skilful; disclo|sing vast recollection, and powers of genius, in

a dismal trying hour;&mdash;even bearing away lau|rels from Monongahela's crimsoned banks, and Braddock's field of slaughter.</P>
<P>When darkness had spread over our hori|zon, and the imperious hand of that nation we till then revered, through a misguided policy, grasped at our rights; on the call of his coun|try he prepares for, and hastens to the battle. With raw, undisciplined troops, he withstands the British veterans: Hovering over the mountains, he descends upon them,&mdash;carrying along destruction, with amaze: and by actions which produced confidence in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ops&mdash;de|jection and astonishment in his enemies,&mdash;ad|miration throughout the world<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The exalted opinion entertained of him by <HI>Frederic</HI> the great, of Prussia,&mdash;this laconic address evinced, affixed to some memorial of personal esteem, transmitted by the king, to the American general: "From the <HI>oldest</HI> general in <HI>Eu|rope,</HI> to the <HI>greatest</HI> general in <HI>the world.</HI></NOTE>; he achieved, in concurrence with a potent, generous ally, the independence of this great, flourishing, wide-extended empire.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="037879_0013_100F6029B835C928">Arrived at the pinacle of military glory, no foul ambition marks his grand career; no Caesar's spirit trampling on the laws; no "Cromwell's guilty of his country's blood;" no usurpation of the public rights, under pretence of public good; But shuning absolute power, which apparently was in his reach, and courted his embrace; he bade an affectionate adieu to the partners of his toil; and rendering back to the authority from whence he received it, that commission which he had so successfully exe|cuted,&mdash;with accumulated honours he returned to his plough.</P>
<P>Possessing talents no less distinguished for their variety, than greatness; prepared to meet the different situations his country might be placed in, as well as all the hazards it was ex|posed to; he was not permitted, in the course of Providence, to continue long in his retreat. The connection formed in the hour of dan|ger, which carried us through the revolution|ary

war, held together by the pressure of ex|ternal force, began to relax; while symptoms of disunion gave dreadful note of the de|struction of these States.</P>
<P>To avert the impending danger, America disclosed a scene, the parallel to which, in like distinguished circumstances, no age before had witnessed&mdash;the people of <HI>independent</HI> so|vereignties forming a bond of union&mdash;selecting men to meet together for that purpose, in Con|vention; men of the first talents, virtue, and public confidence&mdash;a WASHINGTON amongst them. Suddenly the long-gathering clouds re|tired, and the glorious constellation of Ameri|ca, <HI>the Federal form of government</HI> appeared, &mdash;in theory, the most elegant; in operation, coming very near perfection; answering its end more completely than any other&mdash;the hap|piness of a great people.</P>
<P>To realize the hopes of its expanding salu|tary influence, the voice of the people&mdash;now
<PB N="17" REF="037879_0015_100F602CC6E98BE8">
indeed the voice of God&mdash;unanimously fixed on this illustrious citizen, to conduct its operations.</P>
<P>Scarce had he taken his important seat, and our government began to move, when, in a dis|tant country, whose people and whose interests had before been favourites of this, a furious revolution bursted forth; and hideous, mishapen faction rose&mdash;covering her horrid form with the name of liberty. She drew nations to her em|brace; and crushed them. Setting aside the laws of nature, nations, and of God, she stalked in ruin, perfidy, and blood;&mdash;convulsed Europe, and convulsed a world!</P>
<P>WASHINGTON withstood the shock: and while the mo&s;t ancient governments were tot|tering to their foundation; yours he support|ed. While every republic was prostrated; yours <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e established. In a field environed with difficulties&mdash;where scarcely before, a foot had trod, he avoided the quicksands of de|struction,
<PB N="18" REF="037879_0016_100F602FF4DD66C8">
and the wild blasts of the tempest.</P>
<P>When internal commotion threatened, he suppressed it. "Intrigue," says one of his elegant eulogists<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Judge MINCT, of Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ton.</NOTE>, "attempted to entangle him in her poisonous web, but he bursted it with gigantic strength, and crushed her labours. Anarchy looked out from her cavern, and was dashed in oblivion. Insurrection was so struck that it fled from the weight of his arm. The nations of Europe saw the wisdom of our laws, the vigour of our measures; the justice of our policy; the firmness of our govern|ment; and acquiesced in our neutrality."</P>
<P>Having shunned the storm which with tre|mendous violence hath ravaged Europe, and extended to the limits of the world&mdash;which hath destroyed, and is still destroying, some of the finest portions of this globe;&mdash;having preserved you from danger, from whatever source approaching; having, under God, given
<PB N="19" REF="037879_0017_100F603321B82BF0">
prosperity, wealth, happiness and glory to his country, and established her Constitution on a rock, against which, the waves of faction ming|ling with every storm, may rage,&mdash;but if his advice and example are followed&mdash;shall rage and dash in vain; the venerable father of his country now seeks <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">etirement and repose.</P>
<P>The abilities which this illustrious charac|ter disclosed in the different orbits in which he moved, were such as would have rendered him conspicuous in any age, country, or sta|tion: They were competent to the different situations his country was placed in, and to the warding off every danger to which she was exposed: They gave her happiness in peace; security in war; and appeared equally pre-emi|nent in his conduct and management in both. He was endowed by nature with a musculine understanding, which he greatly embellished; but more particularly attended to the strength|ening and enlarging of it. He was possessed
<PB N="20" REF="037879_0018_100F6034A55576F0">
of an uncommon share of common sense: But what chiefly strikes us, was his wonderful pru|dence. Born with strong passions, the usual concomitants of genius, but which frequently impair and sully its lustre; he had acquired a perfect command and ascendency over them. On great occasions, he consulted the opinions and judgment of others; but took not a sin|gle step, without the sanction of his own. He deliberated with a cautious and profound at|tention; he took his resolutions with a deci|sive and immoveable firmness. It appears not that he was covetous of fame; yet in his per|formance of illustrious deeds, fame followed him. If he had what some might denominate ambition, that ambition was no other, than de|votion to his country: superior to personal or private considerations,&mdash;when its interests were in question, he willingly hazarded every thing in their defence.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="037879_0019_100F6036F1D556E8">In his military character, he will always stand high among the highest upon earth. There was an uncommon depth and dignity in his undertakings; there were exerted uncommon powers in the execution of them. He suffered not an advantage to be taken of him, thro' a want of skill, or precaution: and never failed to take advantage of the unwary situation and mistakes of his enemy. He knew when to con|quer by dispatch, and how to conquer by delay. With eagle eye he saw the critical point of op|portunity; with eagle eye he seized upon it. In action he was as brave, as in council provi|dent.</P>
<P>As a Statesman, he was no less illustrious, than as a General. He thoroughly understood the principles and nature of government; its modifications appropriate to the diversity of times, nations, and circumstances; the mea|sures to be pursued at home; the conduct to be
<PB N="22" REF="037879_0020_100F603944AAB3C0">
maintained towards connections abroad. He had the clearest conceptions of the public good, and a discernment that seemed intuitive in his selection of measures, and of men, to promote it.</P>
<P>These patriotic virtues and abilities produ|ced no less affection, than his former services and brilliant exploits excited admiration. All combined to give a respect for his person, su|perior to whatever had been entertained for any other, of whom the annals of history make mention. This respect was not confined to the limits of his own country; it extended wide and far. He was beloved, he was admired, by those whom war only had made his enemies. He was celebrated in all the glow of poetry, and the fire of Demosthenian eloquence; held in the highest veneration by princes, heroes, states|men, sages, writers, historians, and people of Europe;&mdash;and not of Europe alone; but of the whole world.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="037879_0021_100F603C6D0EBE88">Nor was it in public life only that he ap|peared to advantage. His character is not like many portraits,&mdash;to be seen best at a distance, or in particular positions with respect to the light; it may be examined near, with strictest scrutiny: and in every light, constitutes the sublime and beautiful.</P>
<P>Nor is it a character in which, this virtue merely, or the other, is prominent; but, where the whole system of virtues has taken place, and the most arduous amongst them has been practised.</P>
<P>And, no less in the retired scenes of life, than in the apparently more splendid, was he the truly Great Man. Temperate, sincere, in|dustrious, strictly oeconomical in the use and distribution of time,&mdash;sociable, humane, reli|gious, liberal, and just, he was.&mdash;Really, the whole desire of his heart, the whole object of his endeavours, was private, as well as pub|lic
<PB N="24" REF="037879_0022_100F603DF15351C0">
good. The <HI>amiable</HI> character was seen in him, no less than the <HI>illustrious.</HI></P>
<P>Impressively and long will this be remem|bered by those who were honoured with his near acquaintance. Especially do ye bear wit|ness to this, ye mourners around MOUNT VER|NON! ye good people of ALEXANDRIA! wheth|er ye be persons of cultivated understandings, relishing "the feast of reason, and the flow of soul;"&mdash;or whether ye be plain farmers; your WASHINGTON was dear to you as <HI>the Man of your bosoms!</HI> No wonder, ye are afflicted, and <HI>do sorrow that ye shall see his face no more!</HI></P>
<P>He was your friend! the adviser&mdash;the com|forter in your difficulties when disclosed to him; and the sharer in your joy, when he saw your affairs prosper. He was the venerable <HI>neigh|bour,</HI> whose wisdom, hospitality, courteous and obliging nature, were <HI>the charm</HI> of every one of you. How goodly and delightful was it to each, and any of you, in one place, or another, to
<PB N="25" REF="037879_0023_100F604063C94140">
meet and talk with him!&mdash;Friend to the poor! for sure that God-like attribute was his; he com|forted and blessed them at all seasons, by his private liberality: and, it is sufficient to say&mdash; his public largesses, living and dying were wor|thy of himself.</P>
<P>On the ground of stedfast moral principle grafted on religion, his whole demeanor and proceedings appear to have taken their course&mdash; and hence, that moral excellency, which was the life and soul of his most amiable qualities, as well as splendid achievments: hence too those maxims of discretion and integrity, to which he so inflexibly adhered.</P>
<P>The mentioning of this moral principle, and those maxims of conduct which result there|from, brings us to the eminence, <HI>the vantage ground,</HI> from which the great personage whom we are now speaking of, may most happily be viewed.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="037879_0024_100F6042D18ACC88">Brilliancy of talents, and magnificence of action would weigh light in the scale of merit, without personal, inherent goodness. It is <HI>mind</HI> chiefly that makes the man; and it is goodness which constitutes the value of <HI>mind.</HI> When the excellency of moral qualities is <HI>there</HI> seated, other great gifts and deeds have their consum|mate influence, and all their praise.</P>
<P>A <HI>good man</HI> is always a fine character. In framing an idea of such, you must at least se|lect and combine amiable qualities. When these associate with splendid ones, that man is great. Still, here there are various degrees, the high, and the yet higher. "There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon; and another glory of the stars: for one star, and one sun, differeth from another, in glory."&mdash;</P>
<P>I conceive of it as an illustrious circum|stance,&mdash;attaching to your masonic order, gen|tlemen, a respectability unimpeachable hence|forth, and in no instance surpassed before, <HI>that</HI>

WASHINGTON <HI>was a Brother.</HI> If your system were not a true one, never would you have had an opportunity of recognizing him in any such relation: never would he so unequivocally have declared, as he has done, his meeting your communications in the perfect sensibility of fra|ternal attachment, and with sentiments of the highest consideration. His own words are so energetic and honourable to this effect, that I cannot but select, and in this place recite, one of his answers to you. The follow|ing he gave on an interesting occasion:</P>

the true principles of government, is only to have shared with many others, in a labour, the result of which, let us hope, will prove, through all ages, a sanctuary for Bro|thers, and a Lodge for the virtues. Permit me to reciprocate your prayers for my tempo|ral happiness, and to supplicate, that we may all meet hereafter, in that Eternal Temple, whose Builder is the Great Architect of the Universe.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">GENERAL WASHINGTON's answer to the address of the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania, delivered on the 27th of December, 1796.</NOTE></P>
<P>As far as "your light shines before men," and one is justified in speaking of it,&mdash;might I glance a moment on the <HI>Profession</HI> of the Lodge,&mdash;dropping a word of the profoundest veneration, appropriate to your illustrious Bro|ther's late relation to it!</P>
<P>The Lodge, I have heard from the begin|ing, is the association of <HI>good</HI> and <HI>true</HI> men&mdash; faithful, congenial souls, pledged to each other,
<PB N="29" REF="037879_0027_100F6049B74F4188">
to maintain unity, and to do all possible kind offices. Its bounds and extent&mdash;tho' for con|venience it has its lesser districts&mdash;are as large as the world. Peace is its element; Benevo|lence its law; Beneficence its work. Inviola|ble regard for ths glorious builder of the worlds, &mdash;a filial obedience to his blessed communica|tions, &mdash;with that spirit of sublime charity, which is the bond of perfectness,&mdash;this, in a word, is <HI>that testimony</HI> laid up in your most sa|cred archives, which no rude, contaminated hand shall touch.</P>
<P>This comports, as you discern, with the beautiful mandate of the master, Jesus: "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind: and thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."</P>
<P>Yes; those plans must be sublime,&mdash;that system durable, proceeding from such orders, &mdash;copied from that temple, which we are told,
<PB N="30" REF="037879_0028_100F604C17C5F3E8">
is "built upon the foundation of the Apos|tles and Prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner-stone;" where all the parts "fitly framed together," have risen in com|pletest beauty, strength, and proportion: with|in the dimensions of which, all that is great, and good, and happy, is to be found, and is clearly shown;&mdash;where each virtue and duty is seen and recommended by its own peculiar lustre; and all the virtues and duties combine, and mix their salutary in|fluences. O were this regarded as it might be, we should presently behold even a <HI>celestial</HI> Lodge upon earth!</P>
<P>You have seen the illustrious man whom you loved, squaring every action of his life by the plan and rule delineated as above. He gave you in his personal example,&mdash;he left you in the records of his advice, the plainest de|monstration of this. A noble disinterested|ness, a diligence indefatigable,&mdash;a zeal enligh|tened
<PB N="31" REF="037879_0029_100F604F345811F8">
and unabating&mdash;an heroic firmness&mdash; these, with their associate <HI>masonic</HI> attributes, claimed him all their own.</P>
<P>Having briefly touched on those points which the illustrious historians, moralists, and sages will detail at large, and posterity read with rapture;&mdash;we look around the magnifi|cent temple of fame, for some great character, between whom and our present subject, we might draw a comparison; but are at a loss to find one, that will bear the test. Although some are splendid in the field: they lose their lustre in the cabinet: or although they shine equally in both,&mdash;they have not the correspon|dent moral excellencies; neither did they cre|ate such wonderful attachment and affection, as centred in the model before us; They con|stituted not the same great WHOLE.</P>
<P>The character which bears the most re|semblance, and which above all other, I would compare with WASHINGTON's, is that of
<PB N="32" REF="037879_0030_100F6050B994E3F8">
<HI>Alfred</HI> the great, as delineated by the master|ly hand of a profound historian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hume.</NOTE>. "The me|rit of this prince," says he, "both in private and public life, may with advantage be set in opposition to that of any monarch or citizen, which the annals of any age or any nation, can present to us. He seems indeed to be the complete model of that perfect character, which, under the denomination of a sage, or wise man, the philosophers have been fond of delineating, rather as a fiction of their imagi|nation, than in hopes of ever seeing it reduced to practice: So happily were all his virtues tempered together; so justly were they blend|ed; and so powerfully did each prevent the other f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">m exceeding its proper bounds! He knew how to conciliate the boldest enterprize with the coolest moderation; the most obsti|nate perseverance with the easiest flexibility; the most severe justice with the greatest lenity; the most rigorous command with the greatest
<PB N="33" REF="037879_0031_100F605311DDB330">
affability of deportment; the highest capacity and inclination for science, with the most shin|ing talents for action; while he led the way to his people in the pursuits of literature. His civil and his military virtues are almost equal|ly the objects of our admiration; excepting only, that the former, being more rare among princes, as well as more useful, seem chiefly to challenge our applause. Nature also, as if desirous that so bright a production of skill should be set in the fairest light, had bestow|ed on him all bodily accomplishments, vigour of limbs, dignity of shape and air, and a pleas|ing, engaging countenance."</P>
<P>Such was the character of Alfred; such will all pronounce to be the character of WASHINGTON.&mdash;The former lived in an age so dark, that both his virtues and defects were clouded in a degree, by the general surrounding ignorance: of course, might not his virtues seem heightened, from the very circumstance of con|trast?
<PB N="34" REF="037879_0032_100F605679D2F2B0">
Not so, with the renowned personage of our day. In an age by brilliant characters illumined and distinguished, he is illustrious by being the <HI>greatest</HI> among the great. In the most enlightened period of mankind, would the sublime virtues of a WASHINGTON be conspicuous.</P>
<P>The last scene of this unrivalled character was not less great than all the past. After having retired from his labours, devoted for near half a century to his country; while the pleasing recollection of his foregoing life, with the grateful respect of his admiring fellow-ci|tizens, spread the mild sunshine of happiness around him; the outrages and insults of a na|tion, on whom we had a claim for better things, impelled America to assume the posture of de|fence; and called him to her assistance. The hero resumes once more his place, pre-eminent in war. To ensure her safety, he arose a bulwark, bidding defiance to her enemies.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="037879_0033_100F6058CD154610">But alas! while his very name was as an Host, and his existence sure defence&mdash;whilst all eyes were fixed upon him&mdash;all hopes, under the shadow of the Almighty, placed in him;&mdash;dark night spreads her pavilion around&mdash;the king of horrors, proprietor of all things human, wait|ed on him&mdash;He was "not afraid to die." In perfect possession of his mental powers&mdash;se|rene as he was in council&mdash;magnanimous as he was in action&mdash;dignified as he was in all other parts of his life&mdash;WASHINGTON heard the sum|mons. The Hero, the Statesman, the Patriarch of America, the Father of his country, closing his eyes, departed without a groan! Death&mdash; what was thy victory! Humanity, thy bereave|ment! my country, thy loss!&mdash;</P>
<P>Ah! there is a consideration peculiar, which cannot but impress every bosom with increased concern, and deepest sympathy! It hath im|pressed mine! Shall I speak of it? It is too af|fecting for me! Only can I say, It is impossi|ble,
<PB N="36" REF="037879_0034_100F605A52716B98">
on such a review, not tenderly to think of, &mdash;and weep for, thee, most excellent Woman! whose affliction&mdash;</P>
<P>But Almighty God is thy comforter; and heav|en will be thy reward; as it is already thy Hus|band's.&mdash;</P>
<P>Meanwhile, there is a special circumstance, which, while it does honour to this country, affords to <HI>her</HI> a precious consolation. It is ex|pressed in that Lady's own words: "While I feel with the keenest anguish the late dispen|sation of Divine providence; I cannot be in|sensible to the mournful tributes of respect and veneration, which are paid to the memory of my dear deceased Husband; and as his best services, and most anxious wishes were always directed to the welfare and happiness of his country, to know that they were truly appre|ciated, and gratefully remembered, affords no inconsiderable consolation."</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="037879_0035_100F605CB543D958">&mdash;Yes, excellent Lady, that thy dear Hus|band's services are appreci&aacute;ted and gratefully remembered, must afford thee great consolation; and that they shall never be forgotten, still great|er.&mdash;Besides; of his exploits the Hero shall tell. The young warrior shall be ambitious of emulating them. The sage shall speak of his counsels; the statesman shall follow them. All shall rehearse his virtues, to teach the rising generation to imitate them. Millions yet unborn shall speak his praise, and o'er his sacred urn pay the free tribute of gratitude and tears: and when the shining brass, and polished mar|ble shall moulder into dust,&mdash;amidst decaying nature, WASHINGTON shall live. With you, my countrymen, WASHINGTON can never die. He is too strongly engraven on your hearts: He lives in your liberty, independence, and happy consti|tution: He lives in that national prosperity which he obtained for you, and has secured to genera|tions yet to come: He lives in his great exam|ple,
<PB N="38" REF="037879_0036_100F60602868F880">
which hath shewn you how to preserve, what his wisdom and valour had so admirably won.</P>
<P>By all his inestimable services, and splen|did actions,&mdash;by the perfect veneration in which you hold his character&mdash;by the wisdom of his counsels, and the <HI>dignity</HI> of his example; ap|preciate, I beseech you, your conceptions of his memory, by loving your country, as he loved it, and honouring your God, as he honoured him.</P>
<P>May the powers of heaven endue his suc|cessors both civil and military, with virtues and prosperity resembling his; that <HI>they also</HI> may be immortal in the affections of an happy peo|ple!</P>
<P>Citizens, Friends!&mdash;particularly, Brethren of the Lodge! on this solemn day, thus assem|bled,&mdash;and thus impressed with the weight of various mingled concerns;&mdash;let us not part, without availing ourselves, (for well we may,)
<PB N="39" REF="037879_0037_100F6061B248CD80">
of a peculiar consolation issuing from the sys|tem of Divine Revelation,&mdash;to which, the ma|sonic plans avow an attachment&mdash;the consola|tion is, That your venerable Chief is not to be considered as mouldering in dust, and gone for ever&mdash;but, <HI>gone a little before,</HI> assuredly in|vested with a life unperishable.</P>
<P>Yes; the event of his departure you may henceforth reconcile to your feelings, by such an easy, pleasurable mode of conceiving of it, as the sage FRANKLIN expressed, on a valuable friend's decease,&mdash;comparing it to some delight|ful pre-concerted excursion;&mdash;"His carriage was first ready, and he is gone before us. We could not all conveniently start together; and why should you and I be grieved at this, since we are soon to follow, and <HI>we know where to find him."</HI></P>
<P>&mdash;He hath gone before you! He hath as|cended like Elijah, in his triumphal car, and bids us follow. He hath left, meanwhile, an
<PB N="40" REF="037879_0038_100F6064118F3188">
exalted portion of his spirit, and his mantle, to an ADAMS.</P>
<P>In fine;&mdash;There is an immortal energy in virtue. It is what the builder of all worlds, and the Lord of the soul, delights in: "Whatever he delights in, must be happy." It is what your WASHINGTON pursued, and it conducted him to glory.</P>
<P>With every sublime assurance, that the up|right will receive strength and power to do good; that no labour of love,&mdash;no compassionate or generous actions,&mdash;no efforts to promote either general, or particular felicity,&mdash;not even a cup of cold water, given in the name and for the sake of a Brother, (and in the expansive ac|ceptation, all are Brothers,)&mdash;not a wish pure and kind, flowing from man's soul,&mdash;shall ever be underrated by the all-knowing God, or lose its reward;&mdash;confident of this, and of the co|pious inferences and bliss which may be drawn therefrom,&mdash;be ye sublimely watchful and in|dustrious:
<PB N="41" REF="037879_0039_100F60665FC9E0E0">
Rise; shine; for your light abideth inextinguishable for ever.&mdash;And know ye, that, "when your earthly house of this tabernacle shall be dissolved, you have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens."</P>
<P>To the same God,&mdash; be attributed and ascribed all strength, beauty, and wisdom, for ever and ever!</P>
