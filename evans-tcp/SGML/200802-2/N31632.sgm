<HEAD><HI>Rachel</HI>'s Sepulchre; OR, <HI>A</HI> MEMORIAL OF Mrs. <HI>Lydia Willis,</HI> Taken, chiefly, from her Letters to Friends, on various occa&s;ions.</HEAD>
<P><HI>A DESIRE to pre&s;erve the memory of worthy and beloved Friends, e&s;pecially of &s;uch as have, thro' the cour&s;e of their lives, approved them|&s;elves the friends of God, is not only founded in nature, but &s;eems evidently warranted in the holy Scrip|tures. God has told us that</HI> the righteous &s;hall be in everla&s;ting remembrance <NOTE N="(1)" PLACE="foot">P&s;alms 112 6.</NOTE>; <HI>and that</HI> the memory of the ju&s;t is ble&s;&s;ed (2).&mdash;<HI>Which implies the care of Pro|vidence, not by</HI> miracle, <HI>but by the</HI> u&s;e <HI>of</HI> proper means, <HI>in pre&s;erving the memory of &s;uch</HI> ju&s;t <HI>and</HI> righteous <HI>per|&s;ons: While tho&s;e of an oppo&s;ite character, thro' neglect, are forgotten. Their very name is blotted out; as it follows,</HI> but the name of the wicked &s;hall rot.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="041779_0002_101B294180860498"><HI>From this principle, no doubt, and with this view, even to perpetuate the memory of his beloved</HI> Rachel, <HI>the</HI> Patriarch Jacob <HI>rai&s;ed a monument over her grave,</HI> Gen. 35. 19, 20 Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath; and Jacob &s;et a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day: <HI>which was known, in after ages, to be</HI> Rachel<HI>'s &s;epulchre, and re|ferred to,</HI> 1 Sam. 10. 2.</P>
<P><HI>But there are other monuments, equally durable and more in&s;tructive, due to the merits of &s;ome departed friends, which may be ju&s;tly expected, as they are earne&s;tly de&s;ired by the living; for this worthy end, that God may be glorified and prai&s;ed, for his gifts and graces, be&s;towed on the children of men, whereby he alone makes</HI> one <HI>to differ from</HI> another.</P>
<P><HI>The</HI> monuments <HI>here intended, are the</HI> Lives <HI>and</HI> Cha|racters <HI>of per&s;ons, who&s;e excellent &s;pirit, chri&s;tian conver|&s;ation, profitable writings and good works, do furni&s;h ma|terials both to entertain and edify &s;ucceeding generations, who, without &s;uch memorials, would entirely mi&s;s the benefit.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tis with this view, and not without &s;ome hopes of at|taining this end that I have, at the earne&s;t de&s;ire of</HI> one <HI>(whom I could not deny) been per&s;uaded to gather up &s;ome pious remains of</HI> Mrs. Lydia Willis, <HI>who&s;e memory is precious, &s;o far as I have known, to all her acquaintance&mdash; peculiarly &s;o, to her beloved, &s;urviving husband, near re|lations and intimate friends, for who&s;e u&s;e, more e&s;pecially, the&s;e pages are de&s;igned.</HI></P>
<P>Characters, <HI>I know, are oftentimes offen&s;ive; and many unkind reflections, are occa&s;ioned thereby, both on the liv|ing and the dead.&mdash;But why &s;hould any be offended at a</HI> character truly drawn? <HI>Why take offence, at a &s;imple narrative of</HI> facts, <HI>or a true and faithful account of tho&s;e virtues and good things, which evidently took place and
<PB N="3" REF="041779_0003_101B2943DFE7D8C0">
appeared, in the per&s;on's life! And this I take to be the main point, in giving a</HI> character, <HI>even to pay a &s;acred regard to</HI> truth <HI>in relating</HI> facts, <HI>or things that were really found, in the</HI> per&s;on <HI>de&s;cribed. And when all is &s;aid</HI> in truth, <HI>we mean not, thereby, to exalt and prai&s;e the</HI> man him&s;elf, <HI>but</HI> to glorify God in him.</P>
<P><HI>Wherefore, to excite the living to prai&s;e the giver of every good and perfect gift, as well as to comfort and edify her &s;urviving friends, I &s;hall, in &s;implicity of heart, give a &s;ketch of</HI> Mrs. Willis<HI>'s Life and Character; more e&s;pecially as it appears in her</HI> familiar letters, <HI>wherein the genuine breathings of her &s;oul are the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly di&s;|covered, perhaps, of any way in which her ideas were communicated.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Of</HI> the&s;e <HI>I have therefore &s;elected a number, and given the mo&s;t of them at large, exactly as they were written with her own hand; except a grammatical defect hath, now and then, been &s;upplyed. That her letters might ap|pear in their native &s;implicity, I have not &s;o much as corrected &s;ome</HI> inaccuracies, <HI>which a learned pen might have avoided.&mdash;The principal liberty that I have taken, is &s;ometimes to</HI> exchange <HI>a</HI> word <HI>for</HI> &s;ome other, <HI>which is more expre&s;&s;ive of what was evidently her meaning; and the</HI> word <HI>that is</HI> &s;ub&s;tituted, <HI>may be known by inver|ted comma's, before and after it, thus "&mdash;"</HI></P>
<P><HI>But &s;ome of her letters are wholly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; and in tho&s;e that appear, &s;ame &s;triking pa&s;&s;ages are omitted, on account of the &s;ingular</HI> amity <HI>and</HI> friend&s;hip, <HI>that &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between</HI> her <HI>and the</HI> living relative, <HI>to whom they were written; in who&s;e hands &s;he knew her&s;elf to be &s;afe, tho' &s;he wrote with the mo&s;t unre&s;erved freedom.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="041779_0004_101B294567399488">MRS. <HI>Lydia Willis,</HI> late virtuous Con&s;ort of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Eliakim Willis,</HI> Pa&s;tor of the &s;e|cond Church of <HI>Malden,</HI> after ten days &s;ick|ne&s;s, died there, much lamented, on the 25th of <HI>January</HI> 1767, in the 59th year of her age.</P>
<P>She was born at <HI>Duxborough,</HI> April 1709, the only Daughter of Mr. <HI>Thomas Fi&s;h</HI> of that Town decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>A De&s;cription of her per&s;on, (with &s;ome principal branches of her character) is aptly and truely drawn, by another hand, as entered at the clo&s;e of this account.</P>
<P>And yet, to compleat the view of her per&s;on, there is room to add, that &s;he was of an eligible <HI>&s;tature</HI> and <HI>pro|portion.</HI> Her <HI>vi&s;age</HI> comely, e&s;pecially in youth, nor wholly defac'd in age.&mdash;On her <HI>countenance</HI> dwelt a peculiar <HI>&s;eriou&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>plea&s;ancy,</HI> &s;o agreeably compo&s;ed, as to demand re&s;pect, while it &s;en&s;ibly invited to near|ne&s;s and freedom of conver&s;e.</P>
<P>As a grateful acknowledgment to the father of lights, it may be &s;aid, that under the influence of a care|ful and religious education, her youth was pre&s;erv'd from <HI>blemi&s;h.</HI> So that &s;he entered the &s;ocial life, in good repute among her companions.</P>
<P>An early ta&s;te for <HI>reading</HI> led her to acquaint her&s;elf, as opportunity favoured, with <HI>authors,</HI> polite as well as religious; the <HI>latter</HI> more e&s;pecially, &s;uited her reli&s;h and engaged her attention.&mdash;This rendered her conver|&s;ation edifying, while it agreeably entertained her di&s;|cerning acquaintance. So that &s;he was favoured with the be&s;t &s;ociety that her rural &s;ituation and the times afforded.</P>
<P>A good talent at <HI>writing</HI> gave her the advantage of a profitable corre&s;pondence; which many &s;pecial provi|dences occa&s;ioned her frequently to improve.&mdash; Her

con&s;titution (being of the mo&s;t deligate and tender make) &s;ubjected her to habitual weakne&s;s, and frequent di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing &s;ickne&s;&s;es; which, together with numerous other adver&s;e providences, made her indeed a woman of &s;or|row and acquainted with grief.&mdash;She was a per&s;on of uncommon trials and afflictions, from her early days. Which, however, did not &s;ink her &s;pirits, but rather tended, for the mo&s;t part, to wake up and invigorate every facul|ty, and manife&s;t to others, rather than her&s;elf.</P>
<P>She abounded in love and tender affections, not only to her near relations, but to all mankind.&mdash;A mind, &s;u&s;ceptable of the deepe&s;t impre&s;&s;ions, di&s;po&s;s'd her to joy and &s;orrow, in their turns, proportionable to every intere&s;ting event.</P>
<P>On &s;uch occa&s;ions, her letters are mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive of what &s;he felt.&mdash;But as cro&s;&s;es and afflictions were fami|liar to her, even from her youth. The&s;e were, mo&s;t frequently, the moving &s;ubjects, on which &s;he wrote.&mdash; In a very low &s;tate of health, and under &s;ome peculiar trials, &s;he writes, to her brother at Stonington, upon his <HI>marriage,</HI> and &s;ettlement there.</P>

Her very compo&s;ition was <HI>love tenderne&s;s</HI> and <HI>genero&s;ity.</HI>]&mdash;Remar|kably patient in all her di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ickne&s;&s;es; and in her <HI>la&s;t</HI> was favoured with &s;uch di&s;coveries of God, and found &s;uch tru&s;t in him, as abundantly &s;atisfied her attendants and &s;orrowing friends that her hope of eternal life was founded in Go&s;pel evidences of a &s;aving acquaintance with Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>In le&s;s than two months after her decea&s;e, Mrs. <HI>Willis</HI> departed this life, as above related; concerning whom, it remains to be &s;aid, That her reli&s;h for divine things, and deep concern for the prevalence of true godline&s;s in her own heart and life, may further appear from &s;ome <HI>&s;elect pa&s;&s;ages,</HI> found among her private papers, after her death; which ('tis &s;uppo&s;ed) &s;he met with in her reading, and penn'd for her own u&s;e; as what were pe|culiarly agreeable to her &s;entiments, and which deeply impre&s;&s;ed her mind.</P>
<P>They are as follows, viz.</P>

<P>That her early profe&s;&s;ion of religion was followed with the exerci&s;es of devotion; and, abating humane im|perfections, adorn'd with a conver&s;ation becoming the go&s;pel. Her attendance, when able, was con&s;tant on public wor&s;hip and ordinances of God's hou&s;e, where

Her common treatment of tho&s;e that vi&s;ited her hou&s;e, or fell in her way, (not excepting the injurious) di&s;covered a heart full of friend&s;hip and loving kindne&s;s to all men. But her tenderne&s;s and dear affection to her <HI>relatives</HI> was almo&s;t &s;ingular; nor did it fail of &s;uitable returns.&mdash;As a <HI>daughter, &s;i&s;ter, wife</HI> and <HI>mother,</HI> none more affectionate.
