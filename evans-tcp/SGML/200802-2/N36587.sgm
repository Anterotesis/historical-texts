<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</HEAD>
<P>THE reception which the fir&s;t Edition of this Treati&s;e has met with, has made it nece&s;&s;ary to publi&s;h a &s;econd; which I now pre&s;ent to the Reader, with &s;uch additions, as I hope will be acceptable and u&s;eful.</P>
<P>I have collected many authorities, to corrobo|rate what I have advanced; that as my opinions have prejudices to contend with, they may not, however, be objectionable on the ground of &s;in|gularity, and be con&s;idered as &s;upported by no other te&s;timony than my own.</P>
<P>IN treating of the &s;alutary advantages, which the Public will derive, individually, from the gene|ral u&s;e of Coffee, it is impo&s;&s;ible not to reflect al&s;o, on the political benefits which will accrue to the Parent State, by increa&s;ing its cultivation in her Colonies.</P>
<P>To the Coloni&s;ts them&s;elves the object is very exten&s;ive; and &s;urely the pro&s;perity of &s;o import|ant a part of the Empire, as our We&s;t Indian I&s;lands, demands the mo&s;t liberal attention on the part of this Kingdom.</P>
<P>FROM the produce of our plantations, that "magnificent property," as Mon&s;. NECKER terms the French Colonies,
"which only the &s;u|perficial
<PB N="iv" REF="047837_0003_10249D0612EC19D8">and ignorant affect to undervalue,"
this Country receives great additions to her Revenue, and a total &s;upply of one of the mo&s;t u&s;eful arti|cles (perhaps now a nece&s;&s;ary) of life. Yet, from the calamities lately inflicted on &s;ome of them by the hand of Providence, and the accu|mulated burthens which the Public nece&s;&s;ities have laid on them all, many of the Planters are involved in ruin; and tho&s;e who e&s;cape, mu&s;t owe their deliverance to the brave&s;t &s;truggles of indu&s;trious virtue.</P>
<P>THE population of White Inhabitants which is the great &s;ecurity of the I&s;lands, con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of tho&s;e who cultivate the inferior Staple Commodi|ties, among which, Coffee is now the principal; and this population has always been proportiona|ble to the increa&s;e or decrea&s;e of tho&s;e Staples. Indigo may be in&s;tanced as an example: When Indigo was encouraged in Jamaica, before that impolitic duty was laid on it, which exterminated the cultivation of it in our colonies, and gave it to the French, there were con&s;iderably more White Inhabitants in that I&s;land, than there are at pre&s;ent, though the I&s;land now produces five times the quantity of Sugar and Rum it did at that time.</P>
<P>THE cultivation of Coffee requiring but little capital, is an inducement for people of &s;mall for|tunes, to &s;ettle in the I&s;lands. It is a creditable refuge for the indu&s;trious man, who has been un|fortunate in Trade, and to tho&s;e who&s;e larger &s;chemes in life have failed.&mdash;It is an ea&s;y em|ployment; the labour light, and many parts of it performed by children. The &s;ituations and &s;oil where it is carried on, mu&s;t be dry, and of cour&s;e healthy, to be advantageous. Coffee Plantations
<PB N="v" REF="047837_0004_10249D07EDCACB28">in particular, may be con&s;idered as a Nur&s;ery of u&s;eful Inhabitants for the Colonies.</P>
<P>THE Soil be&s;t &s;uited for coffee, is happily &s;uch as can be &s;pared from every other purpo&s;e. Large tracts of poor land, which would otherwi&s;e lie wa&s;te and u&s;ele&s;s, may be rendered as profitable as the be&s;t, without the mortality and ca&s;ualties atten|dant on &s;evere labour in hot climates.</P>
<P>THE numerous little families which live on Coffee Plantations, and are di&s;per&s;ed in &s;mall &s;ettlements, in the interior parts of the I&s;lands, occa&s;ion the mountainous and woody lands to be cleared and opened; and to be inter&s;ected with roads and ea&s;y communications.</P>
<P>THUS the re&s;idents live in &s;afety, and all &s;orts of property acquire a proportionate value and &s;ecurity. The retreats of fugitive Negroes are laid open; plunder and depredation prevented, and con&s;piracies for rebellion are deprived of their hiding-places.&mdash;And thus the credit of the Plan|ter, and &s;ecurity of the Merchant, &s;tand on a firm ba&s;is: Tho&s;e commotions being prevented, which have &s;o often di&s;turbed the tranquillity of the I&s;lands, and occa&s;ioned the ruin of many In|dividuals abroad and at home, to the great de|falcation of that immen&s;e Revenue, which the&s;e I&s;lands pay to the Mother-Country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Duties and Exci&s;es, upon a Computation for the year 1781, amount to about &pound;1,346<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">12, &s;terling, annually, on the produce of <HI>Jamaica</HI> only.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE truth is, that Sugar Plantations, though they are the great &s;ources of wealth to their propri|etors, as well as to Government, do not employ a &s;ufficient number of White People for their inter|nal &s;ecurity, again&s;t the in&s;urrections of the negroes. The manufacture is &s;imple, and the labour whol|ly
<PB N="vi" REF="047837_0005_10249D0B025997D0">carried on by Slaves; and though the Defici|ency Law of Jamaica directs, that one White Per&s;on &s;hall be employed for every thirty Slaves, under a penalty of thirty pounds per annum for every deficiency; yet, this Law is often defeated, or the fine &s;ubmitted to; as White Servants are expen&s;ive, and a le&s;s number than that proporti|on, is &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;es of making Su|gar.</P>
<P>THE cultivation of inferior Staple Commodities, is therefore nece&s;&s;ary to the very exi&s;tence of the Sugar Colonies; and I am per&s;uaded, will prove to them more beneficial in many re&s;pects, than at pre&s;ent is generally imagined.&mdash;Here, then, is an open and grateful field for Colonial Patrioti&s;m; in which the <HI>Amor Patriae</HI> will neither find op|po&s;ition from envy, nor di&s;appointment from in|gratitude.&mdash;Here is the occa&s;ion to demon&s;trate the love of our Country, and to perpetuate a benefit to mankind, which will never be forgotten: and while a PEMRHYN, a LONG, and an EDWARDS, continue to point out to the Public, with that abi|lity by which they are as much di&s;tingui&s;hed as by their weight and con&s;equence, the true intere&s;t of the Sugar Colonies, and of this Country, as connected with them, there will never be wanting &s;ome men, at lea&s;t in the Admini&s;tration of this Kingdom, who will under&s;tand that a &s;ubject of the realm, exerting his indu&s;try at four thou&s;and miles di&s;tance, may be employed as beneficially to the State, and is as much de&s;erving the protec|tion of it, as the Country 'Squire, who leaves his fox-hounds, to give a &s;ilent vote or two during the winter, and retires the remainder of the year to his <HI>Sabine Fields</HI> in &s;loth and ignorance.</P>
<P>SIR NICHOLAS LAWS was the fir&s;t per&s;on who planted Coffee in Jamaica;&mdash;but dying three
<PB N="vii" REF="047837_0006_10249D0D658BF040">years afterwards, in 1731, he had not the happi|ne&s;s to &s;ee the cultivation of it make any con&s;ide|rable progre&s;s.</P>
<P>IN 1732, &s;everal of the Planters and Merchants, belonging to the I&s;land, became patrons of the un|dertaking; and convinced, that under proper en|couragement it might be of importance to the I&s;land, and that Coffee might become a flouri&s;hing Staple Article of produce, they &s;ub&s;cribed the &s;um of 220l. 10s. towards defraying the charges of &s;oliciting an Act of Parliament for lowering the Inland Duty, upon the importation of Coffee from Jamaica into Great Britain; which at that time was 10l. &s;terling per Cwt. The circum|&s;tance being but little known at pre&s;ent, and con&s;idering what obligation the I&s;land is under to their exertions, I am happy in having an oppor|tunity of in&s;erting their names, as a proper tribute to the memory of tho&s;e benefactors to the Colony, and Friends to the Nation.</P>

<P>In the &s;ame year, and in con&s;equence of this &s;o|licitation, the <HI>Act</HI> 5<HI>th Geo.</HI> II. was pa&s;&s;ed, enti|tled, "An Act for encouraging the growth of Coffee in his Maje&s;ty's Plantations in <HI>America.</HI>"&mdash; The preamble recites, that the &s;oil and climate of Jamaica, are particularly adapted for the growth of this Commodity; and the act it&s;elf reduces the Inland Duty upon Briti&s;h Plantation Coffee impor|ted into Great Britain, from two &s;hillings, to eighteen pence per pound:&mdash;And here it &s;tood for many years, producing a Revenue to the Crown of about 10,000l. per anum. A few years ago, on the repre&s;entation of the We&s;t India Planters, <HI>Lord John Cavendi&s;h,</HI> the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, con&s;ented to the very important re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ion of one &s;hilling more; thereby furni&s;hing a mo&s;t u&s;eful le&s;&s;on to all future Financiers,&mdash;<HI>the pre&s;ent Duty of &s;ixpence per pound actually produ|cing nearly three times the &s;um that was received when the Duty was eighteen pence</HI>: So true is the doctrine, that heavy taxation defeats its own purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>IT has been computed, that one acre of land will contain 1100 Coffee plants, which will pro|duce berries in eighteen months from the &s;owing of the &s;eed. The trees will continue bearing for &s;even or eight years.&mdash;Each tree, after the fir&s;t bearing, may produce, at a medium, one and an half or two pounds weight, one with another; and
<PB N="ix" REF="047837_0008_10249D11DBDF6BF8">&s;ix or eight &s;ervants can manage ten or twelve acres, be&s;ides cultivating provi&s;ions for them&s;elves. Upon this ground of calculation, it is apparent, that one acre of land, &s;uppo&s;ing the weather not unfavourable, may yield annually from 1700lb. to 2200lb. weight, which, when brought to mar|ket, may &s;ell for 9l. 15s. to 12l. 15s. &s;terling <HI>net.</HI> This, it is true, is but a &s;mall profit; for it is little more than five farthings per pound, whereas the <HI>Duty alone is &s;ixpence per pound.</HI> If the Duty was equalized to that upon Sugar, the medium profits per acre, would be a|bout 40l. per annum. At pre&s;ent, the <HI>net</HI> pro|fits upon this Article, and upon Sugar in Jamaica, are nearly equal per acre;&mdash;that is, 10l. or 12l. &s;terling.</P>
<P>IN the year 1752, the export of Coffee from Ja|maica, was rated at 60,000 pounds weight. In 1775, it was 440,000 pounds weight.&mdash;Under the pre&s;ent Duty of &s;ixpence per pound, there is rea|&s;on to expect, that the exports may rather in|crea&s;e than dimini&s;h. But it is not likely to be|come a &s;ubject of very exten&s;ive culture in our We&s;t Indian I&s;lands, until even this Duty is low|ered, or at lea&s;t while <HI>Foreign</HI> Coffee is permitted to enter into competition with it at the Briti&s;h mar|ket. Though the Planters of Jamaica after a mul|titude of experiments, and the mo&s;t laudable exer|tions, have di&s;covered the art of cultivating, picking, and curing the berries, &s;o as to make their Coffee equal to the growth of Arabia. Some &s;amples have been produced from that I&s;land, lately, which were pronounced by the London Dealers, even &s;uperior to the be&s;t that has been brought from the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="047837_0009_10249D1417DCBBF0">WHAT revolutions may change the nature of our commerce, were it po&s;&s;ible to fore&s;ee, it is not in my province to examine; but the Legi&s;la|ture of England, as well as tho&s;e of her Colonies, have a wi&s;e example before them, in the conduct of France; by her promoting and protecting the growth of every thing, that can &s;upply the place of tho&s;e articles which Europe purchaces in the Ea&s;t Indies. <HI>Piementa (Myrtus Arborea Aroma|tica foliis laurinis),</HI> or All-&s;pice, as it is com|monly called, from having a flavour, compo&s;ed, as it were, of cloves, cinnamon, juniper berries, nutmegs, and pepper, is the peculiar &s;pice of Jamaica<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From 12,000 to 15,000 bags of Piementa, have been annually imported into England from Jamaica; Each bag contains about one hundred weight. It pays a Duty of about two-pence per pound.</NOTE>: And it equals in virtues, and is more applicable to the general purpo&s;es of life, and lux|ury too, than any &s;pice that is brought from the Ea&s;t. The various u&s;es into which <HI>Piementa</HI> is converted in Europe, are but little known to tho&s;e who rai&s;e it. One &s;ecret, at lea&s;t, I am able to divulge to them, which is, that its e&s;&s;ential oil, coloured with <HI>Alkanet Root,</HI> to give it the ap|pearance of age, is &s;old all over Europe for the oil of cloves<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The principal and prevailing flavour of Piementa, is like that of Cloves: Its oil exactly re&s;embles the oil of that &s;pice, and &s;inks as that does in water. The oil re&s;ides chiefly, like that of Cloves, in the &s;hell, or cortical part.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SIR HANS SLOANE, in the Phil. Trans. Abr. vol. II. p. 667, &s;ays that "<HI>Piementa</HI> may de&s;er|vedly be counted the be&s;t and mo&s;t temperate, mild, and innocent of common &s;pices; and fit to come into greater u&s;e, and gain more ground, than it yet hath, of the Ea&s;t India commodities
<PB N="xi" REF="047837_0010_10249D1710A70FC0">of this kind; almo&s;t all of which it far &s;urpa&s;&s;es, by promoting the dige&s;tion of meat, attenuating tough humours, moderately heating, &s;trengthening the &s;tomach, expelling wind, and doing tho&s;e friend|ly offices to the bowels, we generally expect from &s;pices." To this inferiority of the dear-bought and far-fetched &s;pices of the Ea&s;t, I can bear am|ple te&s;timony;&mdash;while the &s;pice in que&s;tion, be|ing the produce one of our own Colonies, and growing there in the greate&s;t abundance, can be afforded at a price, that the poor of Great Britain may have all the comforts of its excellent proper|ties; which I tru&s;t will be &s;ufficiently made known to them hereafter.</P>
<P>THE encouraging every article which increa&s;|es the intercour&s;e with our Colonies, is increa|&s;ing our Commerce. The payment for all the &s;ta|ples of the We&s;t Indies, is made in our Manufac|tures; the &s;ale of which mu&s;t increa&s;e, in pro|portion to the numbers that are employed in the cultivation of what is bartered for them. Our We&s;t Indian I&s;lands, without draining us of &s;pe|cie or bullion, can &s;upply us with many of tho&s;e very articles for which we are drained in other parts of the world<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The India Company pay for the Mocha Coffee, in Specie. The original co&s;t, is about 7l. &s;terling per Cwt.</NOTE>. The quantity of &s;hipping and &s;eamen, nece&s;&s;arily employed in carrying &s;upplies thither, and tran&s;porting their commo|dities back to Europe, mu&s;t be very con&s;iderable. To the&s;e reflections it mu&s;t al&s;o be added, that the political di&s;advantage of not encouraging our own Colonies, is, that we mu&s;t encourage tho&s;e of the French; which do, and will &s;upply our markets, to the detriment of our Revenue, and the impoveri&s;hing of our Colonies.</P>

<P>IT is a generally received opinion, that the human frame is not le&s;s influenced by diet than by climate; that its di&s;po&s;itions and characte|ri&s;tics owe their originality as much to food, as tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es evidently do, which are the legiti|mate and indi&s;putable i&s;&s;ue of it.</P>

<P>"KHAIR BEG, Governor of <HI>Mecca</HI> by appoint|ment of the <HI>Sultan</HI> of Egypt, was unacquainted with
<PB N="16" REF="047837_0015_10249D21DBBA01D8">Coffee, or of the manner of taking it. As he was going out of the Mo&s;que one day after evening prayer he ob&s;erved in a corner of it a company of people drinking Coffee, who were to &s;pend the night there in prayer, and was much offended at it. He thought at fir&s;t they had been drinking wine; nor was his &s;urpri&s;e much dimini&s;hed af|ter they had explained to him the u&s;e and virtues of this honor. On the contrary after they had informed him how much it was in u&s;e in <HI>Mecca,</HI> and what merriment pa&s;&s;ed at the public places were it was &s;old, he was of opinion that Coffee was intoxicating, at lea&s;t that it conduced to things for|bidden by law.</P>
<P>"FOR this rea&s;on, after having ordered the&s;e people to go out of the Mo&s;que, with an injuncti|on never to meet there for the future upon the like occa&s;ion, he next day convened a great a&s;&s;embly Officers of Ju&s;tice, and Doctors of Law, together with Prie&s;ts, and the mo&s;t eminent men of <HI>Mecca</HI> to whom he communicated what he had ob&s;erved the night before in the Mo&s;que and what he was informed happened frequently in the public Coffee-hou&s;es; adding that he was re&s;olved to remedy this abu&s;e, upon which he was de&s;i|rous fir&s;t to know their opinions.</P>
<P>"THE Doctors agreed that the public Coffee-hou&s;es wanted regulation, as being contrary to the law of pure Mahometani&s;m: and declared that with re&s;pect to Coffee, it was nece&s;&s;ary to examine whe|ther it was hurtful either to body or mind; and concluded to take the advice of Phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>"THE Governor called <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> two Per&s;ons who were brothers, the mo&s;t celebrated phy&s;icians in <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"></HI>: one of them even wrote again&s;t the u&s;e of Coffee, jealous, perhaps (&s;ays our Author), l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t

<P>"A DOCTOR of the a&s;&s;embly replied, that BENGIAZLAH, an ancient Arabian phy&s;ician of great authority, had &s;aid that the&s;e berries were hot and dry and con&s;equently could not have the qualities ju&s;t now a&s;cribed to them.</P>
<P>"THE two Per&s;ian phy&s;icians replied, that BENGIAZLAH was a perfect &s;tranger to the berries in que&s;tion; and declared, that if Coffee was rec|koned among things indifferent, and free for every body to make u&s;e of, yet it was apt to lead to things not allowed of; and the &s;afe&s;t way for true Mu&s;&s;ulmen would be, to hold it unlaw|ful.</P>
<P>"THIS determination obtained all their &s;uffra|ges; and &s;everal, either out of prejudice, or fal&s;e zeal, did not fail to affirm that Coffee had actually di&s;turbed their brains. One of the a&s;&s;i&s;tants main|tained, that it intoxicated like wine, which &s;et all the a&s;&s;embly a laughing; becau&s;e, in order to make a judgment of it, it was nece&s;&s;ary to have drank wine, which is forbidden by the Mahome|tan religion. He was a&s;ked whether he had ever drank any wine and he had the imprudence to an&s;wer in the affirmative; which confe&s;&s;ion condemned him to the ba&s;tinado, the puni&s;h|ment that is inflicted for this crime.</P>
<P>"COFFEE was however &s;olemnly condemned at <HI>Mecca,</HI> as a thing forbidden by law, notwith|&s;tanding the <HI>Mufti</HI> oppo&s;ed the determination. But this rigour was not of long duration; for the <HI>Sultan</HI> of Egypt, far from approving of the indi&s;|creet zeal of the Governor of <HI>Mecca,</HI> was &s;urpri&s;ed that he &s;hould dare to condemn a thing &s;o much in favour at <HI>Cairo,</HI> the capital of his dominions,
<PB N="18" REF="047837_0017_10249D2588B61270">where there were Doctors of much greater autho|rity than tho&s;e of <HI>Mecca,</HI> and who had not found any thing in the u&s;e of Coffee contrary to the law.</P>
<P>"THE <HI>Sultan</HI> ordered him therefore to revoke his prohibition, and to employ his authority again&s;t the diorders only, if there were any, com|mitted in the Coffee hou&s;es; adding that becau&s;e <HI>it was po&s;&s;ible to abu&s;e the very be&s;t things,</HI> even the water of the fountain ZERVIZEM, in the Tem|ple of MECCA, &s;o much e&s;teemed by all Mu&s;&s;el|men, it was not for that rea&s;on nece&s;&s;ary ab&s;olute|ly to forbid them.</P>
<P>"THE two phy&s;icians who bore &s;o great a part in the prohibition of Coffee, came to an unfortunate end.</P>
<P>"AFTER the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of Coffee at <HI>Mecca,</HI> it was prohibited again, and again re|e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>"THE <HI>Sultan</HI> of Egypt con&s;ulted his Doctors of the Law upon this point; who gave their opini|ons in writing, and proved by &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;ons, the fallacy of that condemnation, and the igno|rance of tho&s;e who pa&s;&s;ed it; which e&s;tabli&s;hed the u&s;e of Coffee at <HI>Cairo,</HI> upon a much &s;tronger footing than ever. But in the end, this great city al&s;o met with much trouble upon this &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P>"IN the year 1523 a &s;crupulous Doctor &s;tated, that Coffee intoxicates the head, and is prejudicial to health; and a&s;ked whether it was lawful or unlawful? But none of his brethren were of his opinion, becau&s;e it was obvious that Coffee had not tho&s;e bad qualities he a&s;cribed to it; and therefore this gave no &s;hock at all to a cu&s;tom &s;o u|niver&s;ally received.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="047837_0018_10249D2A5C59B4A8">"BUT about ten years after, a preacher held forth &s;o vehemently again&s;t the u&s;e of Coffee as a thing prohibited by law, that the mob fell upon the Coffee-hou&s;es, broke the pots and di&s;hes, and abu&s;ed the company they found there.</P>
<P>"UPON this there were two parties formed in the city; one of which maintained that Coffee was prohibited by the law; the other, that it was not. But the Judge in chief, having convened an a&s;|&s;embly of all the Doctors, to have their opinions, they all unanimou&s;ly declared that the que&s;tion had been already determined by their predece&s;|&s;ors, in favour of Coffee; that they were all of the &s;ame &s;entiment; and that there was nothing fur|ther nece&s;&s;ary than only to re&s;train the extrava|gant heat of the zealots, and the indi&s;cretion of ignorant preachers. The Judge who pre&s;ided was of the &s;ame opinion; and immediately order|ed all the a&s;&s;embly to be &s;erved with Coffee, and took &s;ome him&s;elf: an example which pre&s;ently compo&s;ed all controver&s;ies, and made Coffee more fa&s;hionable than before.</P>
<P>"AT the time when this cu&s;tom was mo&s;t pre|valent in <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> the <HI>Imans</HI> and officers of the Mo&s;ques made a great clamour, that they were de&s;erted, whil&s;t all the Coffee-hou&s;es were conti|nually crowded. The Dervizes and prie&s;ts fell foul upon Coffee; not only affirming that it was unlawful, but that it was a much greater &s;in to go to a Coffee-hou&s;e than to a Tavern.</P>
<P>"AFTER a great deal of noi&s;e and declamation, all the Prie&s;ts united to obtain a &s;olemn condem|nation of this liquor; and maintained that Coffee roa&s;ted was a &s;ort of coal; and that every thing which had the lea&s;t relation to a coal, was forbid|den by law. Upon this they drew up a que&s;tion in form, and pre&s;ented it to the <HI>Mufti,</HI> with a re|que&s;t that he would determine it according to the
<PB N="20" REF="047837_0019_10249D2C96B33BC8">duty of his office. The <HI>Mufti,</HI> without giving him&s;elf the trouble of examining any difficulties, gave a determination according to the mind of the Prie&s;ts and pronounced that Coffee was prohibited by the law of MAHOMET.</P>
<P>"ALL the Coffee-hou&s;es in <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> were immediately &s;hut up, and the officers of the police ordered to prevent the drinking of Coffee in what manner &s;oever.</P>
<P>"YET notwith&s;tanding the rigour that was u&s;ed in the execution of this order, they could, never prevent the u&s;e of it in private. AMURATH III. in who&s;e time this prohibition had taken place, again indulged a liberty with regard to a thing &s;o agreeable, and which was believed other|wi&s;e not contrary to religion; &s;o that it was al|lowed to be drank in men's own hou&s;es, and grew more and more into e&s;teem. At la&s;t, the officers of the police, &s;eeing there was no remedy, were content for a certain &s;um, to permit it to be &s;old, provided it was not in public; &s;o that it was al|lowed to be drank in private hou&s;es, &s;hutting up the doors, or in the back &s;hops.</P>
<P>"THERE wanted but little, to e&s;tabli&s;h by de|grees the public Coffee-hou&s;es. It happened that a new <HI>Mufti,</HI> le&s;s &s;crupulous, or more wi&s;e than his predece&s;&s;or, declared &s;olemnly that Coffee ought not to be looked upon as a coal; and that the liquor made from it was not prohibited by the law. After this declaration, the Zealots, Preach|ers, Doctors, Lawyers, and <HI>Mufti</HI> him&s;elf, far from exclaiming again&s;t Coffee, took it them|&s;elves; and their example was univer&s;ally fol|lowed by the whole Court and City<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage into Arabia Felix, p. 282, 296.

<P>ABOUT the middle of the fifteenth century, the <HI>Mufti</HI> of Aden, a city in Arabia Felix, travelling into Per&s;ia, learnt the u&s;e of it there, and on his return introduced it to his countrymen.</P>

<P>In 1718 the Dutch began to cultivate Coffee in Surinam; in 1727 the French began to cultivate it in Martinico; and in 1728 the Engli&s;h be|gan to cultivate it in Jamaica.</P>

<P>BUT the time and labour nece&s;&s;ary to produce Coffee of the be&s;t quality have di&s;couraged our Planters from rai&s;ing it at much expence; becau&s;e, until lately, it has been &s;ubject to a precarious, or lo&s;ing market.

The facts have been refuted by DU FOUR, and many travellers.&mdash;Sir THOMAS HERBERT, who was &s;everal years in the Ea&s;t, tells us that the Per&s;ians have a different opinion of Coffee:&mdash;"They &s;ay that Coffee comforts the brain, expels melancholy and &s;leep, purges choler, lightens the &s;pirits, and begets an excellent concoction, and by cu&s;tom, becomes de|licious.

<P>In haemorrhages, particularly in tho&s;e of the pulmonic and uterine kind, the interdiction of Coffee is every where ju&s;tly admitted<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Yet Dr. <HI>Percival</HI> &s;ays it is "powerfully &s;edative." vol.

<P>LET us examine this arbitary re&s;triction to the u&s;e of Coffee, and &s;ee what ju&s;tice there is in the grounds on which it has been impo&s;ed, and what rea&s;on there is in having &s;ubmitted to it.</P>

<P>In "bilious temperaments," facts and experi|ence mu&s;t determine. Bilious temperaments are &s;urely no where &s;o common as in hot cli|mates; and in tho&s;e very countries, Coffee is cer|tainly mo&s;t u&s;ed. There Coffee is found to tem|per and &s;often the acrimony of the bile, and is remarkably &s;erviceable in the cholorea mor|bus. It is ob&s;erved in bilious habits that the &s;tomach receives nothing more agreeably than Coffee; and that the nau&s;ea and inclination to vomit, which often accompany bilious complaints, are taken away by Coffee. In the jaundice, it is u&s;ed with great &s;ucce&s;s, and in ob&s;tructions of the liver.</P>

<P>THE mode of preparing this beverage for com|mon u&s;e, differs in different countries, principal|ly as to the additions made to it.&mdash;But though that is generally under&s;tood, and that ta&s;te, con&s;titu|tion, the quality of the Coffee, and the quantity intended to be drank, mu&s;t be con&s;ulted, in re|gard to the proportion of Coffee, to the water in making it&mdash;yet there is one material point, the importance of which is not &s;o well under&s;tood, and which admits of no deviation.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ervation of the virtues of the Coffee, as has been &s;aid, depends on carefully confining it after it has been roa&s;ted; and not powdering it until the time of u&s;ing it; that the volatile and aethereal principles, generated by the fire, may not e&s;cape.

<P>THERE is &s;carcely any vegetable infu&s;ion, or decoction, who&s;e effects differ from its gro&s;s origin, more than that of which we are &s;peaking.
