<P>MOSES MY SERVANT IS DEAD.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THUS was announced to his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, the Head of the Commonwealth of I&s;rael, the death of one of the greate&s;t men, that has ever appeared on this earth. Famed as a great Lead|er, more famed as a profound Legi&s;lator, and &s;killed as he was in all the knowledge of the age in which he lived, it was &s;till his highe&s;t prai&s;e, that he was the &s;ervant and friend of God, and employed as his chief mini&s;ter in accompli&s;hing one of the greate&s;t enterprizes, that was ever undertaken in any age of the world. He was not however permitted fully to complete the va&s;t undertaking in which he had en|gaged. After re&s;cuing his nation from the &s;lavery of Egypt, leading them through the many dangers, which attended their long journey in the wilderne&s;s, and e&s;tabli&s;hing over them a wi&s;e &s;y&s;tem of govern|ment, Mo&s;es was not &s;uffered by Divine Providence to enter the promi&s;ed land, and partake with his people tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings of peace, freedom, and &s;afety, he had been &s;o eminent an in&s;trument in the hand
<PB N="6" REF="038977_0004_10128683A071B1D0">
of Heaven in &s;ecuring to them. He was allowed to behold it at a di&s;tance from the top of Pi&s;gah; but to conduct them in &s;afety through the Jordan, and e&s;tabli&s;h them in the land de&s;tined for their inheri|tance, was the happy privilege of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>The great and good man, who&s;e death has been lately announced through our land, and to who&s;e memory we are now a&s;&s;embled to pay our tribute of re&s;pect, was favoured above the great Leader and Lawgiver of I&s;rael. He has not only been a &s;ucce&s;s|ful Leader in mo&s;t difficult times and dangerous &s;cenes; he has been permitted by Divine Providence to pa&s;s through them all, to &s;urvive the &s;ufferings and dangers of his country, and &s;ee it, after the &s;trug|gles of a &s;ucce&s;sful war, e&s;tabli&s;hing a &s;y&s;tem of free and efficient government, and under its admini&s;tra|tion enjoying eminent pro&s;perity, and increa&s;ing with unexampled rapidity in wealth, population and &s;trength.</P>
<P>He has now left the&s;e &s;ublunary &s;cenes, full of days and covered with glory, deeply regretted by his coun|try and revered by mankind. His death, felt and lamented &s;o &s;incerely by the inhabitants of this land, is an event which will not be beheld with indiffe|rence in other countries. The world is intere&s;ted in it, for the world has been the witne&s;s of his actions. His name, which is embalmed in the memory of his fellow-citizens, has long had the admiration and re|&s;pect of good men in all countries attached to it; and the&s;e will neither cea&s;e nor be dimini&s;hed, while greatne&s;s is re&s;pected, while wi&s;dom is admired, while virtue is e&s;teemed, and goodne&s;s beloved by mankind.</P>
<P>As the mournful intelligence &s;preads along the
<PB N="7" REF="038977_0005_10128686DE75A738">
land, it carries &s;orrow and affliction with it. The Pre&s;ident, while he
<Q>&s;ympathizes with the nation, and with all good men through the world, in the irreparable lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by us all,</Q>
proclaims him,
<Q>the mo&s;t illu&s;trious and beloved per&s;onage this country has ever produced.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Me&s;&s;age to Congre&s;s.</NOTE> The Senate and Repre&s;entatives of the nation cover them&s;elves and their hou&s;es of a&s;&s;embly in mourning. Our Army is dre&s;&s;ed in weeds, faint emblem of the lo&s;s it feels! Our Navy hangs out the token of public &s;orrow. Our Churches are &s;hrouded in black, ju&s;t picture of the gloom that covers every pious patriotic heart! In our cities the bu&s;tle of bu&s;ine&s;s cea&s;es,&mdash;the hou&s;es of amu&s;ement are clo&s;ed. The &s;ons of indu&s;try forego their profit! the di&s;ciples of plea&s;ure forget their amu&s;ement! No &s;ound is heard but the funeral knell! no countenance is &s;een but in the vi&s;age of &s;ad|ne&s;s! For WASHINGTON <HI>is dead!</HI> WASHINGTON, the &s;ervant of GOD, the lover of his country, the friend of man, is here no more!</P>
<P>The&s;e are the public expre&s;&s;ions of the public feeling. They are not the mere external marks of fa&s;hionable mourning,&mdash;they are not the pomp of affected grief. They are a voluntary tribute of re&s;pect and gratitude, from hearts impre&s;&s;ed with a deep &s;en&s;e of the exalted merits and unequalled &s;ervices of WASHINGTON.</P>
<P>It has &s;eldom, if ever before, fallen to the lot of one man to merit and enjoy, living and dying, and through the whole of a long life, &s;o high a degree of public e&s;timation, and &s;o large a &s;hare of public con|fidence and honour. It has been peculiar to him to &s;hare without interruption, for a long time, in the highe&s;t offices, and in the mo&s;t perplexing and trying
<PB N="8" REF="038977_0006_1012868A840B4F10">
&s;ea&s;ons of pro&s;perity and adver&s;ity, in war and in peace, the undivided affections of his own country, and the admiration and good opinion of all others; the warme&s;t attachment of his friends, and the pro|found e&s;teem even of his enemies. Ages have &s;carce|ly produced &s;uch an in&s;tance, and ages may now pa&s;s away before another &s;uch &s;hall occur!</P>
<P>For, to produce it requires &s;uch a concurrence of circum&s;tances, as can, in the nature of things, but &s;eldom take place. It is not in talents even of the fir&s;t order, united with virtues of the brighte&s;t &s;plen|dor and mo&s;t un&s;potted purity, alone to produce &s;uch a character as that of WASHINGTON. The&s;e di&s;tin|gui&s;hed qualities of the mind and of the heart mu&s;t meet in one, who&s;e &s;ituation is &s;uch as to furni&s;h the means and opportunity for their highe&s;t cultivation and improvement, before they are brought into ac|tion; and they mu&s;t happen &s;o to meet at a time and in a country, which pre&s;ent an opportunity for their full exerci&s;e and perfect di&s;play; when, by great events taking place, a theatre for action is opened, in magnitude and importance equal to them.</P>
<P>But it is rare that talents &s;o eminent and various; and virtues &s;o pure and &s;plendid, meet in the &s;ame per&s;on; &s;till more rare is it for them to meet in a per&s;on, who&s;e &s;ituation is &s;uch, as to have them brought into public view; and yet more uncommon &s;till for all the&s;e circum&s;tances to concur at a time, when great and intere&s;ting events call for their ex|erci&s;e and public di&s;play.</P>
<P>And when God, for accompli&s;hing important pur|po&s;es of his providence, has cau&s;ed all the&s;e circum|&s;tances &s;ingularly to con&s;pire to form one of the
<PB N="9" REF="038977_0007_1012868ECE14A510">
greate&s;t characters, that has appeared in any country, in ancient or modern times; it is undoubtedly our duty to pay it a grateful and re&s;pectful homage. We are to view him, in whom it appears, as the min|i&s;ter of God, rai&s;ed up and commi&s;&s;ioned by him to execute important purpo&s;es of his providence, and render e&s;&s;ential &s;ervices to mankind. In thus hon|ouring the in&s;trument, we honour him who appoint|ed, who employs, who directs,&mdash;and who, at his &s;ov|ereign plea&s;ure, &s;u&s;pends it. To contemplate &s;uch a character has further a natural tendency to produce &s;ome good effect on our own; and by noticing &s;uch an example, there is a hope that we may be led, in &s;ome degree, to the imitation of it.</P>
<P>You will expect me, as an e&s;&s;ential part of my duty on this &s;olemn occa&s;ion, to attempt a character of that illu&s;trious &s;ervant of God, who&s;e life di&s;played &s;o many and &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hed talents and virtues, and who&s;e death occa&s;ions &s;o great and univer&s;al mourning. But it is with diffidence and he&s;itation I venture on a part of my duty, to which I feel my|&s;elf &s;o unequal. My means of information are very inadequate to a ju&s;t performance of the ta&s;k. I have only &s;een him, as you all have, at a di&s;tance, in his public life, and in his public official writings. Be|&s;ides, with the mo&s;t accurate knowledge of the tal|ents, principles, maxims, conduct, and events which have con&s;pired to form a character; it requires pe|culiar talents to place &s;uch an one as that of WASH|INGTON in its ju&s;t point of light. The clouds of heaven exhibit augu&s;t and maje&s;tic appearances. We all behold them with re&s;pect, and have &s;ome ju&s;t idea of their form and motions; but it demands the hand
<PB N="10" REF="038977_0008_101286906988DFA0">
of a ma&s;ter to trace them on the canvas. The &s;un is a glorious and re&s;plendent body. We all &s;ee its brightne&s;s, and feel its warmth; but where is the pencil that dares undertake to delineate it! The im|age of Wa&s;hington, &s;trongly marked as the features of his character are, is impre&s;&s;ed on all our imagina|tions in lively colours; yet, to reflect this image, &s;o as to pre&s;erve the unity of the whole, and the di&s;tinct characteri&s;tic of each of its parts, would require a mirror of more perfect poli&s;h, than you are to expect in a mind of ordinary &s;tructure.</P>
<P>Permit me then only to &s;ay, that the image of this great man is not like that of mo&s;t others, who have &s;hone with di&s;tingui&s;hed lu&s;tre in the annals of the world. It is not compo&s;ed of &s;ome bright &s;pots &s;ur|rounded with dark &s;hades, &s;o as to dazzle without enlightening the beholder. His character is not an a&s;&s;emblage of great talents by the &s;ide of great defects, and &s;plendid virtues contaminated by their vicinity to atrocious vices. He &s;hone with a clear and &s;teady lu&s;tre, which, if it &s;eldom appeared with fla&s;hes of &s;plendor to dazzle and a&s;toni&s;h, was yet never min|gled with &s;hades, nor intercepted by clouds. The circum&s;tance, which &s;eems to di&s;tingui&s;h his name from that of all others, is not the pre-eminence of any one talent or virtue; but, a unity of character, re&s;ulting from the perfect combination and exact balancing of all tho&s;e great and good qualities, which enter into the character of one, who is to po&s;&s;e&s;s pub|lic e&s;teem, guide public opinion, and command uni|ver&s;al re&s;pect and confidence. A countenance, a fig|ure, and a manner, which impre&s;&s;ed awe and com|manded attention, were in him but the index of a
<PB N="11" REF="038977_0009_1012869439742528">
mind, and the evidences of a heart, which de&s;erved them.</P>
<P>It may be u&s;eful however to be more di&s;tinct in our view; and in order to &s;how what Wa&s;hington was, and how he became the glory of this country and the admiration of others, to review the promi|nent parts of his public life, to &s;tudy him in his ac|tions, in the hi&s;tory of our country for the la&s;t forty-five, e&s;pecially the la&s;t twenty-five years, and to read his character in all that has come from his pen. We will &s;et a&s;ide the eulogies of oratory, and the panegyrics which poetry has delighted to &s;hed upon him. The partiality of friends and the enthu|&s;ia&s;m of admirers may flatter and deceive, and we are always di&s;po&s;ed to di&s;tru&s;t their te&s;timony; but actions &s;peak for them&s;elves, and a man's own writ|ings, e&s;pecially in a cour&s;e of corre&s;pondence, which nece&s;&s;arily led him to the con&s;tant expo&s;ure of the motives, the plans, and the &s;ucce&s;s or ill-&s;ucce&s;s of his conduct, will certainly be admitted as deci&s;ive evi|dence, and can hardly fail to di&s;play his true charac|ter, and exhibit him to our view in his ju&s;t light.</P>
<P>It is in the great events of our revolutionary war, and its glorious and happy i&s;&s;ue; the mode&s;t diffi|dence of him&s;elf, reliance on the candor and &s;upport of his country, and pious tru&s;t in the God of armies, with which he accepted the command of the Ameri|can armies; the firmne&s;s, humanity and military &s;kill with which he executed the high tru&s;t, and the dignity with which, after accompli&s;hing for his coun|try all the purpo&s;es of his commi&s;&s;ion, he re&s;igned his command and returned to private life; it is in the patriotic readine&s;s with which, at the call of his
<PB N="12" REF="038977_0010_1012869736EE4180">
country, he again quitted his favourite retreat, and con&s;ented, when the world thought he had nothing to gain and every thing to lo&s;e, at an advanced period of life, to place all his well-earned glory at hazard, by accepting the mo&s;t important and mo&s;t difficult tru&s;t in the gift of his country; it is in the profound political knowledge, un&s;haken integrity, and faithful exertions to promote the good of his country, which he di&s;played for the &s;ame number of years in peace, as he had gloriou&s;ly conducted her armies in war; it is in the pious &s;en&s;e of dependence on Divine Provi|dence he manife&s;ted in every public &s;cene and tran&s;|action of his life, and the re&s;pectful mode&s;ty, united with dignified firmne&s;s, the deep penetration, va&s;t extent of views, and uncommon fore&s;ight, which appear in all his official communications and public corre&s;pondences; it is in the uniform and per&s;ever|ing &s;teadine&s;s he maintained in every change of cir|cum&s;tances and vici&s;&s;itude of fortune, not elated by pro&s;perity nor depre&s;&s;ed by adver&s;ity, not flattered by adulation nor irritated by calumny, not alarmed by danger nor thrown off his guard by fancied &s;afety, &s;o as ever, in his public character, to do a ra&s;h thing or &s;ay an unguarded one, or &s;o as to precipitate him&s;elf into circum&s;tances unfore&s;een, or for which he was unprovided; it is in his &s;uperiority to the charms of greatne&s;s and thir&s;t for power, and the great example of moderation he gave the world, when he once more retired from his high &s;tation to &s;pend the remainder of his days as a private citizen; it is in that true greatne&s;s of &s;oul and di&s;intere&s;ted regard for the public good, he di&s;played in accepting an ap|pointment under his &s;ucce&s;&s;or in the Pre&s;idency, when
<PB N="13" REF="038977_0011_1012869B64C135D0">
the exigencies of his country &s;eemed again to call for his great talents, and great influence and weight of character to be employed in her &s;ervice; it is, in fact, in the whole tenor of his conduct, which hi&s;|tory has recorded, which his grateful country has re|warded with unanimous approbation, with unlimited confidence and undivided attachment, and which fu|ture generations will not cea&s;e to contemplate with admiration and reverence, that we are to &s;eek for the character of this great man.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent generation is convinced, and po&s;terity, when it reads the hi&s;tory of the times in which he lived, will never doubt, his having united in his per|&s;on all tho&s;e great qualities of the mind and good properties of the heart, which the world, not always &s;o ju&s;t, has agreed in attributing to him.</P>
<P>His entrance on the great theatre of public action, which we may date at the commencement of the American revolution, placed him in a commanding attitude to the view of the world, and intimated what was to be expected from his patrioti&s;m, his in|trepidity, his abilities, and his &s;en&s;e of duty. To take the command of an undi&s;ciplined army, which was to operate again&s;t veteran troops and experienced generals; in a conte&s;t with one of the mo&s;t wealthy and powerful nations of Europe; at a time when public opinion was much divided in re&s;pect to the right and expediency of re&s;orting to arms, and when it could not but be doubtful whether the re&s;ources, or the courage, or the fortitude of the country, ad|mitting the ju&s;tice of the cau&s;e, would be equal to the conflict, and continue to &s;upport him; mu&s;t have happened either from an incon&s;iderate unreflecting
<PB N="14" REF="038977_0012_1012869D00BF0A40">
ra&s;hne&s;s, or from a deliberate &s;en&s;e of duty, and a patriotic readine&s;s to &s;erve his country, connected with a daring, yet cool intrepidity of character.&mdash; From which of the&s;e it did in fact re&s;ult, we can be at no lo&s;s, after attending to the manner in which he executed the tru&s;t.</P>
<P>In the organization of his army, in the &s;election and di&s;po&s;ition of his officers, in the plans of his campaigns, and in the general mode of conducting the war, he di&s;played the talents of the great com|mander.</P>
<P>In his vigilant and cea&s;ele&s;s care to manage with the utmo&s;t economy, at the &s;ame time with the great|e&s;t effect, the re&s;ources of his country; and in de|clining to be benefitted by them him&s;elf by receiving any compen&s;ation for his &s;ervices, he manife&s;ted, that while he was &s;uperior to motives of private emolu|ment, he had a great regard for the public intere&s;t.</P>
<P>His uniform re&s;pect for the civil authority, and the &s;crupulous obedience he always paid it, mani|fe&s;ted his accurate ideas of the foundation and nature of civil liberty, and evinced that he was equally di&s;|tant from holding the principle, or countenancing the practice of de&s;poti&s;m in any form; and that he had a ju&s;t abhorrence of the encroachment of one branch of power on the rights of another.</P>
<P>The &s;everal actions in which his per&s;on was ex|po&s;ed, and the coolne&s;s, intrepidity, and intelligence with which he conducted them, te&s;tify to his per|&s;onal bravery.</P>
<P>The &s;everal in&s;tances in which he di&s;covered daring enterpri&s;e, and practi&s;ed &s;ucce&s;sful &s;tratagem, are brilliant monuments of his military genius.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="038977_0013_101286A04697A710">His unremitting attention to the lives, health, and comfort of his &s;oldiery, his care to avoid the unnece&s;|&s;ary effu&s;ion of blood, and his reluctance to retaliate cruelties on the enemy, appear as plea&s;ing evidences, that to his other great virtues he added the le&s;s &s;plen|did, but not le&s;s amiable one of humanity.</P>
<P>His holding together, year after year, an army compo&s;ed of freemen, unaccu&s;tomed to the hard&s;hips of a camp, and the nece&s;&s;ary rigour of military di&s;|cipline, &mdash;mo&s;t of the time but poorly paid, &s;ome|times indifferently fed, and often badly clothed;&mdash; in the face of an enemy often &s;uperior in numbers, and always enjoying every advantage of di&s;cipline, military habits, and adequate &s;upplies;&mdash;his doing this in &s;uch a manner as to overcome all ob&s;tacles, ince&s;&s;antly to annoy and di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;ometimes to obtain brilliant advantages over an enemy pur&s;uing him with &s;uperior forces, is a &s;trong and deci&s;ive te&s;|timony to his unconquerable con&s;tancy and patience, and the va&s;t re&s;ources of his mind. Common &s;pirits would have &s;unk under the complicated perplexities and con&s;tantly increa&s;ing difficulties he had to en|counter. Overcome by di&s;appointments, harra&s;&s;ed by oppre&s;&s;ive and vexatious cares, and chagrined by the want of adequate &s;upport, and of &s;upplies equal to exi&s;ting exigencies, they would have de&s;paired of their country, and abandoned her cau&s;e. With him, they &s;erved only to call forth the energies of a mind always &s;upplied with new re&s;ources, and ready to encounter new difficulties and dangers.</P>
<P>In acquiring and maintaining without interruption the entire confidence of the army, the government, and the people at large, through the whole cour&s;e of
<PB N="16" REF="038977_0014_101286A4C0F452E0">
a war always di&s;tre&s;&s;ing and often unfortunate,&mdash; bringing it to a happy conclu&s;ion, and then retiring to private life, loaded with the benedictions and fol|lowed by the prayers of millions, he &s;howed that all his conduct, while it &s;prung from the be&s;t motives, mu&s;t have been regulated with con&s;ummate pru|dence, and dictated by an accurate knowledge of human nature. It furni&s;hed unque&s;tionable te&s;timo|ny, that, with the great talents of the commander, he had the mild virtues of the citizen; that with the courage, enterpri&s;e, and vigour of the &s;oldier, he had the moderation of the philo&s;opher; that while he was formed to acquire fame by achieving great ac|tions, he was al&s;o calculated to gain e&s;teem, attach|ment, and confidence by performing good ones, and by being evidently governed in all his public and pri|vate tran&s;actions by the pure&s;t principles and a &s;teady &s;en&s;e of duty.</P>
<P>Behold him again, when experience had taught his country the nece&s;&s;ity of an efficient government to embrace the intere&s;ts, and to en&s;ure the &s;afety, pro&s;perity, union, and independence of an exten&s;ive and growing empire, at the head of an a&s;&s;embly of &s;ages, &s;elected by his country to form &s;uch a con&s;ti|tution of government; and after it was formed, and adopted by the people, twice placed, by the unani|mous &s;uffrages of his fellow-citizens, in the fir&s;t office in the admini&s;tration of it! Hitherto he had been chiefly di&s;tingui&s;hed as a military character, He is now to be admired and to &s;hine with equal &s;plendor as a &s;tate&s;man.</P>
<P>Far from being puffed up with the pride of office, dazzled with the glare of greatne&s;s, or corrupted by

<P>We &s;ee him the &s;ame WASHINGTON in peace, that he had been in war,&mdash;at the head of the nation, that he had been at the head of the army; exhibit|ing the &s;ame &s;kill in organizing the government, that he had done in organizing the army,&mdash;di&s;playing the &s;ame abilities in the cabinet, he had done in the field; the &s;ame prudence to avoid difficulties and dangers, the &s;ame courage to encounter them, the &s;ame forti|tude to bear them, and the &s;ame re&s;ources to extri|cate him&s;elf and his country from them. We &s;ee him, by pur&s;uing a &s;teady and uniform cour&s;e in his admini&s;tration at home, and adhering inflexibly to the principles of ju&s;tice and good faith, and a pacific policy in his tran&s;actions with other nations, com|manding re&s;pect abroad, and &s;till maintaining the confidence and firm attachment of his own coun|try. We &s;ee him, as &s;oon as the &s;tate of his coun|try would permit, voluntarily retiring from public

life to re&s;ume the freedom and enjoy the ea&s;e of a private citizen; thus, after having eminently di&s;|played, through the whole of his public life, every virtue which can adorn the man, the &s;oldier, the &s;tate&s;man, and the chri&s;tian, at the clo&s;e of it furni&s;h|ing a rare in&s;tance of republican principle and philo|&s;ophic moderation.</P>
<P>Thus con&s;tituted by nature, thus formed by edu|cation, and thus &s;ituated by circum&s;tances, he became the pride of his country, the ornament of human nature, the admiration of mankind,&mdash;the glory of the pre&s;ent age, and the example of future genera|tions.</P>
<P>But here I pau&s;e. The grave pays no re&s;pect to greatne&s;s, no deference to worth, no attention to the prayers of a nation, no regard to the tears of the world! It makes no di&s;tinction in favour of the great, the wi&s;e, and the good,&mdash;the benefactors of mankind, and &s;upporters of &s;ociety. The&s;e, as well as the meane&s;t and mo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s members of the &s;o|cial body, mu&s;t be laid low in the du&s;t.</P>
<P>But when, by the wi&s;e appointment of Heaven, men of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction and u&s;efulne&s;s are num|bered with the dead; amid&s;t the tumult of &s;orrow and the deep and general &s;en&s;e of public lo&s;s, the event is u&s;ually accompanied with its con&s;olations. In the event we now feel, and commemorate with &s;uch deep and &s;incere affliction, there are con&s;olatory con&s;iderations, which ought on this occa&s;ion to be brought to view.</P>
<P>One of a very obvious nature is, that he, who&s;e death we mourn, has left the world at a time mo&s;t favourable for the perfection of his own character.

Nothing further was wanting to render it complete. He had lived to acquire all the glory, that one man could acquire. He had arrived to old age without one &s;tain on his fair reputation. He had no new fame to gain by living longer. In his la&s;t public act, by con&s;enting to place his reputation once more at hazard, at a time of life, when, though there was yet no apparent diminution of the vigour of his pow|ers, he could hardly expect, had he been called into the field, to continue long capable of acting with the &s;ame vigour as in the meridian of life, he had given a very &s;trong proof of the &s;incerity of his patriot|i&s;m, &mdash;that it was indeed &s;uperior to all per&s;onal con|&s;iderations of ea&s;e or fame. For he certainly thus expo&s;ed him&s;elf to the danger of acting for the good of his country, beyond what was perfectly &s;afe for his own reputation, and beyond what a predominant regard for <HI>that</HI> would have dictated. A deci&s;ive ev|idence, had any been wanting, of the &s;incerity, &s;trength, and purity of his love of his country.</P>
<P>He had be&s;ides lived to be fully gratified in this, his ruling pa&s;&s;ion, by &s;eeing his nation, to who&s;e &s;er|vice he had devoted the be&s;t part of his life, happy in a good con&s;titution of government, and a faithful admini&s;tration; and rapidly progre&s;&s;ing in wealth, re&s;pectability, and the means of pro&s;perity and de|fence.</P>
<P>Another con&s;olatory reflection, which cheered the good heart of that great man in his la&s;t days, and ought to cheer ours now, is one which al&s;o re&s;pects the &s;tate of our country. He had lived to &s;ee the admini&s;tration of the government going on well in the hands of a &s;ucce&s;&s;or; and we have found by hap|py

experience, that God has rai&s;ed up others to fol|low him in the path of glory and u&s;efulne&s;s, capa|ble of managing with &s;kill and &s;ucce&s;s our great na|tional concerns. It is true, the pre&s;ent po&s;ture of our country, both in regard to its internal &s;tate and its foreign relations, is critical and hazardous. It calls for great vigilance, firmne&s;s, and ability, and great weight of authority in the Supreme Executive, to maintain its po&s;ition, pre&s;erve its independence, and &s;ecure the re&s;pect of other nations, and keep tranquillity at home. But experience of the talents and fidelity of the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration has con|firmed and greatly increa&s;ed the public confidence in it. And this increa&s;e of the public confidence is the &s;ure&s;t pledge we can have, that it will be &s;ucce&s;sful. We thus tru&s;t in God, that it will be po&s;&s;ible for us to maintain our independence and &s;upport our free government, though we have no longer to depend on the talents and the name of WASHINGTON.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t con&s;olatory con&s;ideration, and one which ought to excite &s;trong and univer&s;al &s;enti|ments of gratitude is, that his life was prolonged to &s;o great an extent; and that he had opportunities of rendering us &s;o many, &s;uch various, and &s;o long con|tinued &s;ervices, under circum&s;tances &s;o important and peculiar, and which required &s;uch eminent talents, and called for &s;uch uncommon popularity. It was a peculiar &s;mile of heaven on our land, that a life &s;o valuable was pre&s;erved through the dark days and trying &s;cenes of our country; that he was permitted to aid us through a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing war, and afterward, in peace, to contribute the weight of his character, as well as the fidelity of his labours and the vigilance
<PB N="21" REF="038977_0019_101286B2E948F458">
of his care, to &s;ettle the affairs of the nation, and to e&s;tabli&s;h and organize the government. This &s;hould not cea&s;e to call forth our mo&s;t fervent gratitude to Heaven, and awaken this day the &s;tronge&s;t &s;en&s;ibili|ties of our hearts.</P>
<P>I &s;hould not do ju&s;tice to this occa&s;ion, and the duty you have a&s;&s;igned me, were I not now to call your very &s;erious attention to &s;ome improvement of this &s;olemn and affecting di&s;pen&s;ation of providence. It is the dictate of patrioti&s;m and a duty of chri&s;tian|ity, while we revere the hand of Heaven in an event &s;o afflictive, to li&s;ten to the admonition it carries with it, and to profit by the le&s;&s;ons of intere&s;ting in|&s;truction it conveys. A death, which cau&s;es the tears of a nation to flow, has its important u&s;es. It is a &s;olemn admonition of the in&s;tability of all human greatne&s;s, and an affecting in&s;tance to a&s;&s;ure us, that neither wi&s;dom nor worth can re&s;cue from the grave.</P>
<P>To all who are in public authority, to all who have the important intere&s;ts of their country intru&s;ted to them, this event &s;hould come with deep impre&s;&s;ions of their re&s;pon&s;ibility. It &s;hould excite &s;erious re|flections on their obligations to &s;ociety, and on the account they mu&s;t render of their fidelity in the di&s;|charge of tho&s;e obligations, to him who has all the affairs and all the intere&s;ts of &s;ociety in his hands.</P>
<P>To every grade of office in &s;ociety there is attached a degree of re&s;pon&s;ibility, proportioned to the im|portance of the duties, and the exten&s;ivene&s;s of the influence, of that office. Every man of principle will enter on any public tru&s;t committed to him, with a &s;trong &s;en&s;e of this re&s;pon&s;ibility. He will carry it with him, and cheri&s;h it with zeal in all the duties of
<PB N="22" REF="038977_0020_101286B652FE6188">
his office; and it will be impre&s;&s;ed on him with new and peculiar force, when he &s;ees one, who has &s;u&s;|tained the highe&s;t offices, who has had the highe&s;t tru&s;ts repo&s;ed in him, and been called to act in the mo&s;t con&s;picuous, the mo&s;t intere&s;ting, and mo&s;t dif|ficult &s;ituations, &s;ummoned to appear at the bar of a righteous God, to be recompen&s;ed according to the rectitude of his principles and the fidelity of his &s;er|vices.</P>
<P>This event &s;hould admoni&s;h us all not to <HI>put our tru&s;t in man, who&s;e breath is in his no&s;trils, nor in the &s;on of man, in whom there is no help;</HI> but, looking to <HI>men</HI> only as the <HI>in&s;truments</HI> of Heaven for accompli&s;hing the great purpo&s;es of providence, to fix our hope &s;teadfa&s;tly in God, and place our &s;afety and pro&s;per|ity in his hands, who was the God of our fathers, and who will never for&s;ake us their children, if we place our whole tru&s;t and hope in him.</P>
<P>When great and good men are rai&s;ed up to per|form eminent &s;ervices in very critical times,&mdash;to guide a people by their wi&s;dom, prudence, con&s;tancy, and fidelity, through perilous &s;cenes, and rai&s;e their country to glory and pro&s;perity; we ought to be grateful for their &s;ervices, to love and re&s;pect them while living, and to honour their memory when they are dead. But to place all our dependence on any one man as the ark of our &s;afety, and to con&s;ider all our political intere&s;ts as &s;u&s;pended on his life, would be the height of imprudence,&mdash;the madne&s;s of en|thu&s;ia&s;m. It would betray an impious di&s;tru&s;t of the power or goodne&s;s of Providence; as if, when its in&s;truments for doing good had accompli&s;hed their end, it could not rai&s;e up others to &s;upply their places,
<PB N="23" REF="038977_0021_101286B7EABE9C98">
according as the exigencies of mankind &s;hould re|quire them!</P>
<P>This event &s;hould accordingly teach us, while we deeply regret the lo&s;s of departed worth, far from de&s;pairing of the protection of Heaven, far from di&s;|tru&s;ting its future care, and far from feeling a diffi|dence of the &s;ufficiency of its in&s;truments to &s;ecure our &s;afety and promote our pro&s;perity, to turn our eyes with hope and confidence to LIVING WORTH, and to value, e&s;teem, and honour it. To what, my friends, was it owing, that Wa&s;hington had it in his power to do &s;o much good for his country? Was it not greatly owing to the confidence, which was placed in him by the people? I would not detract from his abilities, or le&s;&s;en your opinion of his vir|tues. I do believe them both to have been of the very fir&s;t order and pure&s;t kind. But, with the tal|ents and virtues of an angel of heaven, I a&s;k, whether he could have performed for his country the &s;ervices he did, had he been looked upon with jealou&s;y, be|held with &s;u&s;picion, thwarted in all his views, oppo&s;|ed in his plans, and counteracted in his exertions? had the motives of his conduct been perpetually called in que&s;tion, and calumny permitted to with|draw from him the &s;upport and good opinion of his fellow-citizens?</P>
<P>Let it not, O my country! let it not be the ba&s;e &s;tain of thy character, while thou honoure&s;t the mem|ory of thy defenders who are gone, to blacken the names of tho&s;e who &s;urvive; while thou <HI>builde&s;t the tombs of thy dead prophets, to &s;tone the living!</HI> While, with an honourable zeal, we pay the tribute of re|&s;pect to decea&s;ed merit, and remember with gratitude
<PB N="24" REF="038977_0022_101286BC83704B78">
the &s;ervices of tho&s;e, who are no more; let us, my dear fellow-citizens, be ju&s;t to the living! Let the fidelity of pa&s;t &s;ervices give a confidence in the rec|titude and ability, which are to render future &s;er|vices. And having placed our Rulers in &s;tations, in which we expect them to do us good, let us not do them the inju&s;tice, nor our&s;elves the injury, to with|draw from them that confidence and &s;upport, with|out which it will be with diffidence, with embarra&s;&s;|ment, and with hazard, that they attempt to &s;erve us. Their be&s;t plans for promoting the public good may be prevented from execution, their mo&s;t patri|otic exertions may be defeated, and their mo&s;t wi&s;e and faithful &s;ervices prove ineffectual, unle&s;s we their con&s;tituents, after putting the admini&s;tration of gov|ernment into their hands, are ready to aid them in it with our cheerful confidence and firm &s;upport.</P>
<P>There is one further improvement we ought to make of the mournful event, which we this day no|tice. It is, to re&s;pect the prudent admonitions of our now departed friend; and to cheri&s;h a proper regard for tho&s;e ju&s;t principles of government, and lend a merited attention to tho&s;e wi&s;e maxims of moral and political conduct, which in the cour&s;e of his public life, and particularly at the clo&s;e of it, he inculcated with all the &s;incerity and zeal of friend&s;hip, and with all the &s;olicitude of paternal concern.</P>
<P>We have all read and admired his public official papers, his proclamations, his circular letter at the clo&s;e of our revolutionary war, and his mo&s;t valuable addre&s;s to the inhabitants of the United States, when he announced his re&s;olution of quitting the Pre&s;iden|tial chair. It is now for us to do &s;omething more
<PB N="25" REF="038977_0023_101286C0C83034E8">
than admire. We &s;hould be &s;olicitous, as far as our individual practice is concerned, or our influence ex|tends, to promote the great purpo&s;es in view in that excellent addre&s;s, in which he la&s;t, and mo&s;t eminent|ly, appeared as the <HI>Father of his country,</HI> by a&s;&s;uming the peculiar right of a father, to coun&s;el, admoni&s;h, and warn.</P>
<P>This we &s;hall do, when we exert our&s;elves to pro|mote that &s;pirit of union, he &s;o earne&s;tly recom|mends, by laying a&s;ide party &s;pirit and the u&s;e of party names, by rejecting geographical di&s;tinctions and local prejudices, and endeavouring to perpetuate the integrity, and &s;trengthen the bonds of the union: when we &s;ubmit to the laws of the land, and en|courage a cheerful &s;ubjection to all the con&s;tituted authorities; always di&s;countenancing a &s;pirit of in|&s;urrection, and the di&s;po&s;ition of the minority to con|trol the majority; a &s;pirit utterly oppo&s;ed to the fir&s;t principles of republican liberty, and incompatible with order and peace: when we encourage religion, morals, and literature, and the in&s;titutions for pro|moting them: when we cheri&s;h public credit, by u&s;ing it as &s;paringly as po&s;&s;ible, and adopting the mo&s;t rigid and exact economy: when we avoid all unnece&s;&s;ary foreign connexions, all national attach|ments and antipathies, preferences and hatreds; and, while we ob&s;erve good faith, with &s;crupulous and con&s;cientious fidelity, with all nations, &s;hun with caution the influence and a&s;cendency of any; not only &s;o as to guard our public coun&s;els from being polluted; but al&s;o &s;o as to pre&s;erve public opinion, which, in a free government, mu&s;t always regulate them, from being contaminated: when we pre&s;erve

in fact a neutral po&s;ition, as far as it can be pre&s;erved, and &s;teadily pur&s;ue a pacific policy, in re&s;pect to the nations of Europe, with who&s;e relative intere&s;ts we have no concern, and in who&s;e contentions it is de|&s;irable to take no part. The&s;e la&s;t are indeed dictat|ed by maxims of conduct, which relate <HI>immediately</HI> to the government, and not to individuals: but as the acts of government, under elective forms, are but the expre&s;&s;ions of the public opinion and will, it is in the power of each individual to contribute &s;omething toward forming and expre&s;&s;ing that public opinion; and it becomes important for him to take care, that he do it with fidelity, and with a &s;acred regard to the&s;e maxims of political wi&s;dom, and principles of political rectitude.</P>
<P>Such is a &s;ketch of tho&s;e good coun&s;els, impre&s;&s;ed on us by our departed friend, which we ought to pre&s;erve with the &s;ame fidelity and zeal, that we cheri&s;h the memory of him, who with &s;o much af|fection, and &s;o feeling an intere&s;t in the future wel|fare of the United States, has inculcated them upon us, admoni&s;hed us of their importance, and recom|mended them to our frequent review.</P>
<P>It only remains for us, as the la&s;t method of im|proving this melancholy occa&s;ion, and the la&s;t tribute of re&s;pect we can pay to the memory of the illu&s;tri|ous decea&s;ed, to profit by his in&s;tructive example; in public life to imitate the virtues of his public char|acter, and in private life to copy tho&s;e humbler vir|tues, which &s;hone with le&s;s &s;plendor indeed, but with equal clearne&s;s, and &s;carcely with le&s;s u&s;efulne&s;s or
