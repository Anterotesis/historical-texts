<P>That it met with any favorable reception, from the pulpit, was doubtle&s;s, owing more to the affecting &s;olemnity of the occa&s;ion; to the high &s;en&s;e which the Legi&s;lature enter|tained of the worth of the decea&s;ed GEORGE WASHINGTON, and to their unfeigned &s;orrow for his death, than to the merit of the per|formance it&s;elf.</P>

<P>"Help, Lord, for the godly man cea&s;eth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men."</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the familiar cour&s;e of human events we are apt to be regardle&s;s of the hand of God, in the u&s;ual operations of nature, and in all the ordinary in&s;tances of mortality which are pre&s;ented before our eyes.</P>
<P>There is no doubt that, upon due con&s;ide|ration, the one of the&s;e would be interpreted into clear indications of an over-ruling Pro|vidence, and the other improved into impre&s;|&s;ive and affecting memento's of human frail|ty. Through the familiarity of both, howe|ver, we are &s;ufficiently attentive to neither.</P>
<P>But when the Sepreme Ruler of the Uni|ver&s;e makes bare his arm by &s;ome &s;ignal di&s;|play of his power, his &s;overeignty, or his di&s;|plea&s;ure, when he vi&s;its a city with &s;ome deadly contagion, or removes from among&s;t us &s;uch of our fellow men as were eminently virtuous and u&s;eful, who had engro&s;&s;ed our affections, and on who&s;e pre&s;ervation our intere&s;ts mate|rially
<PB N="4" REF="036983_0004_100C3317F8E82550">
depended; when he makes the Godly man to cea&s;e, and the faithful man to fail, he rou&s;es by &s;uch high di&s;pen&s;ations the attenti|on of all his creatures, and cau&s;es them to mourn under the afflictive vi&s;itations of his rod.</P>
<P>Impre&s;&s;ed by &s;uch circum&s;tances with a &s;en&s;e of our weakne&s;s and dependence, and affected by the occurrence of &s;uch &s;orrowful events, we are brought to perform the duty, and exerci&s;e the privilege of nature, by put|ing our&s;elves more immediately under the guardian care of Heaven, and flying for &s;uc|cour to the throne of grace. Hence the im|portunate application of the P&s;almi&s;t in the words of the text.</P>
<P>Who was the particular &s;ubject of his plain|tive &s;trains, it is not material that I &s;hould now &s;tay to enquire. They are applicable to the ca&s;e of all good men; for their lives are more or le&s;s important to the peace and pro&s;|perity of this world.</P>
<P>On the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion we under&s;tand their application, alas! too well. Never did a peo|ple meet with &s;o great a lo&s;s as that which we deplore. Never was there before &s;o loud a call for earne&s;t &s;upplication to the Father of Mercies. Never had the people of America &s;uch cau&s;e of funeral grief as that which has brought us together to-day. The Godly man hath cea&s;ed, and the faithful hath failed:&mdash; The beloved WASHINGTON is no more.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="036983_0005_100C32FF49AEBE98">Often do we behold the &s;orrows of the af|flicted parent, the di&s;con&s;alate widow, or the helple&s;s orphan; but in this &s;ad in&s;tance all America is become a hou&s;e of mourning, and &s;ignals of di&s;tre&s;s appear on every &s;ide. The melancholy tidings of his death have deeply afflicted all di&s;criptions of per&s;ons. The a|ged &s;ire, and tender matron bow down the hoary head in pen&s;ive &s;orrow; and the cheek of the ingenious youth is bedewed with tears. In this numerous a&s;&s;embly I &s;ee &s;adne&s;s de|picted in every countenance.</P>
<P>On this memorable day the whole repre|&s;entatives of the people of his native State, by who&s;e appointment the&s;e funeral honours are paid, appear in the &s;able badge of mourning in te&s;timony of their grief for the lo&s;s of this illu&s;trious, faithful man; and every individu|al citizen &s;ympathizes in re&s;pon&s;ive &s;or|row.</P>
<P>It is no wonder; he was the "Hero of li|berty, the father of his country, the fir&s;t of pa|triots, and the friend of man."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>NOTE.</P><P>Mr. Madi&s;ons eulogium in the A&s;&s;embly.</P></NOTE> Great is the worth of men of piety and virtue to every com|munity; but when the&s;e are found to adorn con&s;picuous &amp; important &s;tations, it is wholly incalculable. The Godly and the faithful man is not only the mo&s;t re&s;pectable in his private character&mdash;he is not only an honor to the &s;tate that gave him birth, and to the race
<PB N="6" REF="036983_0006_100C33016F405040">
from which he &s;prang, but he is the brighte&s;t ornament, and the mo&s;t exten&s;ive benefactor to the world at large.</P>
<P>Virtue is not only nece&s;&s;ary to the peace and happine&s;s of private life, but it is that alone by which a nation can ri&s;e to greatne&s;s, or enjoy any la&s;ting pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>This, in a greater or le&s;s degree, is true of all nations; but to tho&s;e which, like ours, are ble&s;&s;ed with free republican forms of govern|ment, of which virtue is the leading princi|ples, it is of &s;till the greater u&s;efulne&s;s, and the more indi&s;pen&s;ible nece&s;&s;ity. It not only reflects upon them their greate&s;t lu&s;tre, but is, in truth, their only &s;ure defence.</P>
<P>When vice and licentiou&s;ne&s;s, by an injudi|cious choice, or any unfortunate accident, are advanced to important and influential &s;tati|ons of honors, of profit, or of power, they do not confine them&s;elves within the immediate circle of the court, but they diffu&s;e their bane|ful influence all around, and gradually pervade and corrupt all parts of the community. En|couraged by the practice, in&s;tead of being &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by the influence of tho&s;e who are in authority, they &s;talk abroad with hardy front, until finally they triumph over the ho|nor, the dignity, the liberties, nay, the very exi&s;tance of the people. Hence the &s;aying of the wi&s;e man in the Proverbs; "when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn."</P>
<P>In contra&s;t with this, let us view the Godly
<PB N="7" REF="036983_0007_100C3303F226AB38">
and the faithful man, in a like &s;ituation, and learn hence to e&s;timate the infinite &s;uperiority of his character, and his worth to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Walking in the "paths of truth and grace" he is not only him&s;elf a mo&s;t dignified and venerable character, but becomes to others a pattern worthy of all imitation. He exhibits virtue in its native comeline&s;s and purity, and from the eminence of his &s;tation he &s;preads a glory around it. He recommends religion by his example: He re&s;trains vice by his au|thority. That prevails and rejoices under the patronage of his &s;miles&mdash;this flies from his pre&s;ence, or &s;hrinks at his approach with all the pu&s;illanimity of con&s;cious guilt. "When the righteous man is exalted the people rejoice." In him virtue is per&s;onified as their repre&s;en|tative, and to him their intere&s;ts, as far as this is nece&s;&s;ary, are chearfully entru&s;ted. The amiable excellence of his character acquires their confidence, and his entegrity renders the depo&s;it &s;afe.</P>
<P>Surely the death of &s;uch a man is ju&s;tly to be regretted as a great public lo&s;s; and with affecting propriety has it been made the &s;ub|ject of the P&s;almi&s;t's lamentations in the pa&s;|&s;age before us. Such a man, my Brethren, was the dear friend whom we have lo&s;t.</P>
<P>He was well tried: he was thoroughly proved by his country in a long and variegat|ed life. He always held him&s;elf ready to obey it's call on any emergency, and he ever di&s;|charged his tru&s;t with the utmo&s;t fidelity. He
<PB N="8" REF="036983_0008_100C33057AC78BE0">
entered into it's &s;ervice in the prime of his life, and he continued in it, with but little in|termi&s;&s;ion, to the day of his death.</P>
<P>In every &s;tation which this great man fil|led&mdash;in every &s;phere of life in which he was appointed to move, I might call upon our fel|low citizens from one end of the continent to the other, and with tears of gratitude they would all bear te&s;timony that he invariably exhibited the evidence, and maintained the character of a "Godly and a faithful man."</P>
<P>As long as the people of America &s;hall con|tinue ble&s;&s;ed with the enjoyment of peace, of liberty and independence, it will not be for|gotten that next to a kind and gracious God, who always made this country his care, they are greatly indebted for them, to the manly firmne&s;s, the unremitted exertions, and the inviolable fidelity of GEORGE WASHINGTON&punc;</P>
<P>Rai&s;ed up by Divine Providence to defend the liberties and vindicate the rights of his country, he nobly &s;tepped forward in the day of her di&s;tre&s;s, when oppre&s;&s;ed by foreign do|mination, and bleeding from the wounds in|flicted by an invading army; and again&s;t a formidable ho&s;t, led on her little band of pa|triots. Then did his mighty &s;oul, which ne|ver brooked oppre&s;&s;ion, exert its energy. A &s;incere lover of liberty, and "early accu&s;tom|ed to appreciate its value," he exchanged the ea&s;e of dome&s;tic retirement for the field of battle, and fought valiantly for the people and for "the cities of his God." Nor from this
<PB N="9" REF="036983_0009_100C3307AE450050">
did he withdraw until liberty was effectually &s;ecured, and its triumphs were proclaimed throughout our happy country.</P>
<P>Through many a weari&s;ome and long cam|paign, and in all the vici&s;&s;itudes of war, &s;ome|times pro&s;perous, and often adver&s;e, he was the uniform, the faithful, and the &s;teadfa&s;t friend.</P>
<P>In his highe&s;t pro&s;perity he entertained no thoughts of ambition; and in the darke&s;t and mo&s;t gloomy hour, when the hopes of many were beginning to fail, and they were almo&s;t ready to give the &s;truggle for liberty up, the &s;teady &s;oul of WASHINGTON, firm and unmov|ed, animated with the pure&s;t patrioti&s;m; and fixing his hopes on Heaven, was &s;table as a rock. He never for a moment de&s;erted the all important cau&s;e, nor &s;uffered him&s;elf to de&s;pair of &s;ucce&s;s. At every hazard he re|&s;olved to defend the intere&s;ts of his beloved country, or that he would not &s;urvive its downfall, but peri&s;h rather in the general ru|in.</P>
<P>If the united voice of America did not ren|der it unnece&s;&s;ary, there are, I perceive in this a&s;&s;embly not a few who would be ready to at|te&s;t the ju&s;tice of the character which I have thus far drawn. There are tho&s;e here who were with him in the war, almo&s;t from the be|ginning to the end, who were witne&s;&s;es of his wi&s;dom in the council and his valor in the field&mdash;who were trained to arms in his camp, who have often fought by his &s;ide, and whom
<PB N="10" REF="036983_0010_100C330A2F3C8398">
I &s;ee alive this day to the friend&s;hip which was contracted in adver&s;ity, and cemented by the precious blood of many a fallen and many a &s;urviving patriot. A&s;k the&s;e men&mdash;a&s;k all of this di&s;cription, to a man, who &s;hall be con|vened throughout America, on this mournful occa&s;ion, what the decea&s;ed WASHINGTON was &mdash;whether he was always at his po&s;t in the hour of danger&mdash;whether he loved his country&mdash; whether he was <HI>faithful</HI> to the important tru&s;t which &s;he committed to his hands? and read the an&s;wer in their eyes.</P>
<P>O! WASHINGTON! now that thou art gone, delicacy to thy feelings no longer forbids &s;trict ju&s;tice to thy merits. To thy country thou ever wa&s;t a "good and faithful &s;er|vant.</P>
<P>When the &s;torm of war was over, he took an affectionate leave of his brave companions in arms, re&s;igned his commi&s;&s;ion into the hands of Congre&s;s, and returned to the quiet walks of private life. But there he was not long permitted to enjoy repo&s;e. In him were concentered the valor of the &s;oldier, and the wi&s;dom of the &s;age; and he was called upon by the unanimous voice of his countrymen, to admini&s;ter the government which they had ordained, to "pre&s;erve dome&s;tic tranquility," and perpetuate the liberty he had contributed &s;o much to acquire. The con&s;tiution of the United States was quite a new experiment. It was the re&s;ult not only of their united wi&s;|dom; but of their mutual conce&s;&s;ions al&s;o,
<PB N="11" REF="036983_0011_100C330C39CC95C8">
and the admini&s;tration of it mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity have been an arduous ta&s;k to which the great|e&s;t experience, prudence, and intelligence a|lone were adequate. It was in our now de|cea&s;ed friend that the&s;e qualities were in the highe&s;t degree combined, and on his &s;houlders was impo&s;ed the mighty burden. In the ca|pacity of Chief Magi&s;trate, for eight years he laboured ince&s;&s;antly to promote the public good, which evidently appeared to be the on|ly object of his ambition.</P>
<P>On the &s;ubject of politics, I am but little in&s;tructed, and with it, it is &s;till le&s;s my in|clination to intermeddle. To &s;ay nothing then, of the acknowledged &s;uperiority of the beloved Pre&s;ident's talents as a &s;tate&s;man, &s;uf|fice it to ob&s;erve, that notwith&s;tanding the contrariety of opinion that &s;oon appeared a|mong&s;t our fellow-citizens re&s;pecting govern|ment as a &s;cience, or the admini&s;tration of it as an art: notwith&s;tanding that upon this &s;ubject, brother and brother, father and &s;on, were often found divided again&s;t each other; yet, not the &s;malle&s;t &s;u&s;picion of GEORGE WASHINGTON's integrity ever mingled it&s;elf with any di&s;approbation of public mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>In March 1797, he re&s;igned this honorable and important office, and retired once more to his peaceful abode at Mount Vernon, which had long been the favorite object of his wi&s;h|es. His re&s;ignation was accompanied by an affecting token of his love, in communicating to his fellow-citizens the re&s;ult of his experi|ence,
<PB N="12" REF="036983_0012_100C330DC9089B58">
and in tendering to them his la&s;t father|ly advice re&s;pecting their &s;entiments and con|duct towards each other, and their true poli|cy as a nation. And then, with all the ten|derne&s;s of parental fondne&s;s, he took an af|fectionate leave.</P>
<P>If on this &s;orrowful occa&s;ion, a place could be found for any critici&s;m on his &s;tyle and compo&s;ition, I would ju&s;t ob&s;erve that the writings of WASHINGTON, correct without &s;tu|dy, elegant without art, re&s;emble a native woodland flower&punc; which di&s;plays numberle&s;s unde&s;cribable beauties to the eye of every be|holder, it&s;elf alone uncon&s;cious of its charms. &mdash;While his precious memory &s;hall warm and animate, the&s;e will plea&s;e, in&s;truct and edify the late&s;t po&s;terity.</P>
<P>He now flattered him&s;elf that he had bid|den a final adue to all the troubles and per|plexities of public life, and that he &s;hould be permitted to &s;pend the little remainder of his days in peace. But, alas! the deceitfulne&s;s of all earthly pro&s;pects! like the Patriarch Abraham, he had to encounter the &s;evere&s;t trial in the concluding &s;cene.</P>
<P>His country, alarmed by the apprehen&s;ion of foreign danger, ca&s;t her eyes once more up|on her well-tried, faithful general, for her de|fence, if the calamity which &s;eemed to im|pend &s;hould actually befal: I have called this the &s;evere&s;t trial, becau&s;e he was now far ad|vanced in years, and his arm was enfeebled by age. But old as he was, though he heard with
<PB N="13" REF="036983_0013_100C330F629103A8">
grief, he obeyed with promptitude his coun|try's call and prepared him&s;elf once more to take the field, whenever nece&s;&s;ity &s;hould re|quire, and buckle the armour on his weary limbs.</P>
<P>In this juncture of affairs it plea&s;ed the God of Heaven, who&s;e councils are to us unknown, to take him from us, and relea&s;e him from all his labours. He called him to put the harne&s;s off, and enter into his re&s;t. What fate awaits our beloved country, it belongs to him alone who can pry into futurity, to tell. We hope &amp; tru&s;t in God that the olive branch of America will &s;till be regarded, and that our amba&s;&s;a|dors abroad and envoys extraordinary, will, by his ble&s;&s;ing &s;ucceed, in accommodating on honourable terms, all exi&s;ting differences, and in perpetuating peace with all the nations of the earth.</P>
<P>But if not: if our ears are again to be a&s;&s;ail|ed by the din of arms, and war &s;hall rage, we &s;hall mi&s;s this valiant faithful man, and the anxious enquiry in America, will be, where &s;hall we find another WASHINGTON?</P>
<P>In drawing the character of the great and illu&s;trious, it is not the only object to pay that tribute to merit which ju&s;tice demands, but e&s;pecially to exhibit their example for the imitation of others. With this view, permit me to add, that our departed friend was not only a faithful, but a Godly man. Fidelity to his country was an amiable and &s;triking trait in his character; but to render it complete,
<PB N="14" REF="036983_0014_100C3311C6C068A8">
we add, piety to God. This, like the oil on Aaron's robe, gives it a &s;weet perfume: or, like the mantle of Elijah, on the &s;houlders of Eli&s;ha, it &s;preads maje&s;tic grace and glory a|round it. Such was WASHINGTON. Virtue a|dorned his private life, and his fir&s;t act of Pro|vidential duty was to dedicate him&s;elf to God, and commend his country to his divine pro|tection. This act of piety made the hearts of all good men in America glad, and they re|joiced under the au&s;pices of a chief magi&s;trate who thus paid homage to the Ruler of the Univer&s;e.</P>
<P>But &s;till more was the piety of their gene|ral the ground of their confidence through the more perilous &s;cenes of war. While his valor and fortitude qualified him, above his fellows, for the command of a patriotic army, this not only endeared him to all the wi&s;e and virtu|ous, but made him, as they rightly &s;uppo&s;ed, the peculiar care of Heaven. They were not mi&s;taken. This fortified his integrity, and this &s;ecured his camp. The valiant chief, altho' he was him&s;elf an ho&s;t, and &s;uperior in courage and conduct to the oppo&s;ite commanders, yet knowing that "the battle was not always to the &s;trong," with his eyes directed to Heaven, commended him&s;elf and his army to the gui|dance of infinite wi&s;dom, and to the protection of our omnipotent &s;hield. Thus qualified he went forth under the banners of the Lord of ho&s;ts: he fought in his &s;ear, and conquered in his name.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="036983_0015_100C3314E7E539F0">"The fir&s;t in peace, and the fir&s;t in war," he was a &s;ingular example of virtue, and piety ih both. In the humble &s;phere of private life, in the more &s;plendid chair of &s;tate, and a|mid&s;t the confu&s;ion and licentiou&s;ne&s;s of war, this great man "walked with God." His heart was impre&s;&s;ed with the highe&s;t rever|ence for his holy name, and in his pre&s;ence the mouth of the profane was &s;hut.</P>
<P>Who of the heroes of antiquity &s;hall com|pete for fame with the illu&s;trious chief?&mdash; Alexander was vain glorious, and &s;ometimes cruel&mdash;Cae&s;ar was ambitious&mdash;and the life of Cato terminated in an act of &s;uicide.</P>
<P>But WASHINGTON was not ambitious. Such was his mode&s;ty that but for the trump of fame, the ri&s;ing generation had not known that he was the "hero of liberty" who re&s;cu|ed them from bondage. Guided by the wi&s;|dom, and protected by the power, he was al&s;o re&s;igned to the will of Heaven. Piety adorn|ed his youth; it rendered his "hoary head a crown of glory," and &s;oftened his dying bed. His &s;etting &s;un went down unclouded and &s;erene, the happy pre&s;age of a bright &s;ucceed|ing day.</P>
<P>Alas! "The Godly man hath cea&s;ed, and the faithful hath failed."</P>
<P>Heavy and afflictive is the lo&s;s which the people of America have &s;u&s;tained by the death of this great man. It is only in &s;ome mea&s;ure retrievable by the improvement we &s;hall make of it. Let us then, under this &s;ore vi&s;itation&punc;
<PB N="16" REF="036983_0016_100C3316708CB600">
learn in the fir&s;t place, humbly to acknow|ledge and adore the hand of God. He is the &s;overeign di&s;po&s;er of all events, and he has a right to do what&s;oever he will with his own. In his adorable, but to us mi&s;terious providence he has taken away our WASHINGTON, and though we cannot but mourn his lo&s;s, yet, &s;ince it is the will of Heaven, we will endea|vour not to repine.</P>
<P N="2">2. To &s;ub&s;&s;imion to the divine will, let us add a grateful acknowledgement of divine goodne&s;s. God who hath taken our dear friend away, fir&s;t gave him to us, qualified for the mo&s;t important purpo&s;es. The whole of his u&s;eful life was devoted to the good of his country, and he lived to a good old age. He lived to perform the important work of pro|curing and e&s;tabli&s;hing the independence of America, and proclaiming liberty to all her &s;ons. Thro' all the perils and the fatigues of war: amid&s;t the dangers of the field of battle, and under the pitched tent on the cold ground by night, the life and health of the illu&s;trious chief, and of his valiant army, were mo&s;t gra|ciou&s;ly pre&s;erved. Many a brave patriot fell; but the Gen. on whom &s;o much depended was carefully protected from the "pe&s;tilence that walked in darkne&s;s, and from the arrow which flew by day." Nor was he taken hence until he &s;aw his country &s;milling in peace, and &s;et|tled under the mo&s;t excellent con&s;titution that any nation on earth ever enjoyed. For all

the&s;e mercies "let the people prai&s;e thee, O God; let all the people prai&s;e thee."</P>
<P N="3">3 The character of the decea&s;ed, while it endears his memory, &s;hould al&s;o be improved into a &s;ource of con&s;olation to all who mourn his death. People of America&mdash;affectionate fellow-citizens of his native &s;tate, ye may weep for your&s;elves; but weep not for WASH|INGTON. He re&s;ts at length from all his la|bours: and if a man&s;ion be prepared in glory, for piety and virtue, thither I tru&s;t he is gone, and there will he &s;hine; as a &s;tar in the ferma|ment, for ever and ever. "Ble&s;&s;ed are the dead who die in the Lord."</P>
<P N="4">4. Suffer me to recommend the example of our departed friend, to the imitation of his countrymen. It is dignified and lovely, and &s;hews to what perfection human nature may arrive. In this, although he is dead, he &s;till &s;peaks to us. Ye youth of America, the hope of your country&mdash;ye ri&s;ing patriots of Virginia&punc; learn that to be truly great, you mu&s;t be &s;incerely good.</P>
<P>Who will now fill the place of the American chief? The expecting eyes of your country are turned upon you. She will have need for you, in the cabinet, at lea&s;t, if not in the field. If you would be prepared to do her &s;ervice, &s;tudy the character, cultivate the virtues, and follow the example of your WASHINGTON.</P>
<P N="5">5. Finally, let us improve this &s;olemn occa|&s;ion, by &s;erious reflections on our own tenden|cy to the du&s;t. We have here no abiding city.

"It is appointed to all men once to die," and the temple of this body will &s;oon be di&s;&s;olv|ed. Let us apply to the redeemer of the world for pardon, and &s;alvation. Let us implore the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of divine grace that we may "&s;o number our days as to apply our hearts to wi&s;dom." Let us cordially imbibe the prin|ciples of piety, and &s;teadily pur&s;ue the practice of virtue; &s;o that when this "earthly hou&s;e of our tabernacle &s;hall be di&s;&s;olved, we may have a building of God, a hou&s;e not made with hands, eternal in the Heavens."&mdash;AMEN.</P>
