<Q><HI>KNOW YE NOT THAT THERE IS A PRINCE AND A GREAT MAN FALLEN THIS DAY IN ISRAEL?</HI></Q>

<P>IF &s;plendid talents and &s;ublime virtue; if undeviating integrity and heroic patrioti&s;m, are not mere empty names; if a life, the mo&s;t u&s;eful and important, devoted to the deare&s;t in|tere&s;ts of his country, can command the affection and e&s;teem of a grateful people; then the NAME of WASHINGTON will be always dear to Amer|icans.</P>
<P>In the character of this great Man were united all tho&s;e excellent qualities which adorn and dig|nify human nature. He was rai&s;ed up at a period when &s;uch uncommon talents were mo&s;t wanted, and when, by an extraordinary combination of circum&s;tances, he had the faire&s;t opportunity of di&s;playing them to the greate&s;t advantage. His death, though delayed by a kind Providence till he had nearly filled the u&s;ual &s;pan of life, has ca&s;t a mo&s;t &s;olemn and affecting gloom over the whole nation. And who, my brethren, is not ready to

exclaim in the melancholy language of the text, <HI>Know ye not that there is a Prince and a great Man fallen this day?</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e words are a part of that &s;hort but beauti|ful Eulogy pronounced by King David at the fu|neral of Abner. They were the undi&s;&s;embled ef|fu&s;ions of a heart deeply impre&s;&s;ed with the &s;ud|den lo&s;s of a brave and worthy man. Abner was chief general of all the armies of I&s;rael which yet adhered to the hou&s;e of Saul; and from duty and principle had been a public enemy to the king|dom of David. He had probably &s;worn allegiance to the family of Saul; and, like a faithful man, he endeavoured to maintain the honour of that crown as long as there was a probability of &s;ucce&s;s. He evidently &s;aw that the kingdom of David was daily increa&s;ing in &s;trength, and that of his ma&s;ter as rapidly declining. Rea&s;on and humanity uni|ted in urging the nece&s;&s;ity of a union of all the tribes under one common head. He announced his determination to the King, and, after confer|ring with the Elders of I&s;rael upon the &s;ubject, he thought proper to go in per&s;on to Hebron to ac|compli&s;h the bu&s;ine&s;s. King David received him and his &s;uit in the mo&s;t cordial, friendly manner. The preliminaries of the union were agreed upon, and Abner di&s;mi&s;&s;ed in peace. Immediately after, Joab, who led the ho&s;ts of David, returned to Hebron, and was informed of what had pa&s;&s;ed. He went in directly to the King, and reproved him &s;everely for his credulity; denouncing Abner as a treacherous &s;py, and all his pretended friend&s;hip
<PB N="5" REF="036877_0005_100B2958A54EEF10">
as the ba&s;e&s;t duplicity. The fact was, he enter|tained a murderous de&s;ign again&s;t Abner, who had &s;lain his brother A&s;ahel in battle &s;ome time before. He &s;oon became re&s;olved in the bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;ent me&s;&s;engers after Abner, which brought him again to Hebron. As &s;oon as he had reached the gate, Joab met him with the appearance of friend&s;hip, and, &s;moothing his &s;ullen brow, he concealed the ba&s;ene&s;s of his de&s;ign under a fal&s;e, in&s;idious &s;mile; and in this unguarded moment he plunged the fatal dagger into the brea&s;t of this worthy Hero.</P>
<P>When the information of this melancholy event had reached the ears of David, he declared him|&s;elf and kingdom "guiltle&s;s before the Lord for|ever from the blood of Abner." He gave com|mandment to Joab as head of the military depart|ment, and to "all the people that were with him, to rend their clothes, and mourn before Abner." "And King David him&s;elf followed the bier." "And the King lift up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept. And the King lamented over Abner and &s;aid, Died Ab|ner as a fool dieth?" No. "Thy hands were not bound, nor thy feet put in fetters; as a man fall|eth before wicked men, &s;o felle&s;t thou. And all the people wept again. And the King &s;aid unto all his &s;ervants, <HI>Know ye not that there is a Prince and a great Man fallen this day in I&s;rael?</HI> I am this day weak though anointed King." We have &s;el|dom &s;een this excellent man in a more dignified attitude, than when weeping at the grave of Ab|ner.
<PB N="6" REF="036877_0006_100B295C1B4794E0">
He di&s;covered a magnanimity of &s;oul upon this occa&s;ion worthy of imitation. To lay a&s;ide all re&s;entment again&s;t a man who had &s;o lately acted as his foe, and to pay a voluntary tribute of public re&s;pect to his memory, was doing a &s;till greater honour to him&s;elf. It is not a mere weak|ne&s;s in human nature, but a real excellency, to weep over fallen greatne&s;s. Shall we not then, my brethren, indulge our tears upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion; when we reflect that the Man who con|ducted us to freedom and independence, and who &s;o ardently "loved our nation," is now no more?</P>
<P>Perhaps the words of the text could never be applied to any man with greater propriety, than to him who&s;e death we this day deplore. If we &s;hould look over the characters of the greate&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of men who have lived in any age of the world, we &s;hall find few, if any, who have excelled him in wi&s;dom or virtue; and who have &s;u&s;tained &s;uch important tru&s;ts with &s;o much dignity to them&s;elves or advantage to mankind. But nei|ther the great nor the good are &s;uffered to con|tinue, by rea&s;on of death. Yet, while we mingle our undi&s;&s;embled &s;orrows with the tide of general grief, and mourn their lo&s;s, we may hope that God will rai&s;e up others to fill their places with equal reputation.</P>
<P>From the &s;ubject thus introduced, the following ob&s;ervations are propo&s;ed to your con&s;ideration and improvement, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P>FIRST. That in every age and nation it hath plea&s;ed God to rai&s;e up and qualify &s;ome men for
<PB N="7" REF="036877_0007_100B295EDBB3C048">
the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed honours, and for the mo&s;t eminent u&s;efulne&s;s.</P>
<P>SECOND. That when &s;uch highly re&s;pected characters are removed by death, ju&s;tice and grat|itude demand a &s;uitable tribute of re&s;pect to be paid to their memories.</P>
<P>Both &s;acred and profane hi&s;tory unite in e&s;tab|li&s;hing the&s;e propo&s;itions. To illu&s;trate the fir&s;t, we &s;hall bring into view &s;ome of tho&s;e characters who have been particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed in differ|ent profe&s;&s;ions, and at different periods.</P>
<P>That all men are ab&s;olutely equal either in their natural or acquired endowments, or that they are equally fitted to fill the mo&s;t elevated &s;tations, none, I pre&s;ume, will undertake to prove.</P>
<P>The &s;y&s;tem of nature not only di&s;covers an in|finite variety of beings, but a great variety of grades in the &s;ame &s;pecies. Order and &s;ubordina|tion are &s;een through all her works. We behold the &s;un in the centre of our &s;y&s;tem, &s;hining with plea&s;ing maje&s;ty, while the primary planets are continually revolving around him; they, in their turn, receive a &s;imilar attention from their &s;atel|lites, which revolve about them. "One &s;tar dif|fereth from another &s;tar in glory; &s;o al&s;o is the re&s;urrection of the dead." There mu&s;t then have been as real a difference before the re&s;urrection: for this will be conformably to the characters they &s;u&s;tained in life; and in heaven, that &s;tate of per|fect felicity, we read of "angels and archangels, of cherubim and &s;eraphim, of thrones and do|minions, of principalities and powers."</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="036877_0008_100B296116CEEDA0">
As men are formed with very different capaci|ties, &s;o they are undoubtedly de&s;igned for very dif|ferent employments. Every man has it in his power to be u&s;eful in his proper &s;phere. The wi&s;e Author of nature has de&s;igned &s;ome particular pur|&s;uit and employment for each individual. In this, and this o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> he can do all the good he is capable of.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have been the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings to mankind, have not all been eminent for the &s;ame things, nor in the &s;ame degree. Such as have been rai&s;ed up by God, from age to age, to lead, to in&s;truct, and to deliver his people, have gener|ally been con&s;idered as the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ings to their fellow-men; and therefore their memories have been the mo&s;t honoured. Hence the ingeni|ous Arti&s;an and the penetrating Philo&s;opher, the enlightened Divine and the patriotic Civilian, the wi&s;e State&s;man and the brave General, have al|ways been highly re&s;pected by all civilized nations.</P>
<P>Man was at fir&s;t occupied in tilling the ground; and however &s;imple it may appear to &s;ome, it mu&s;t be allowed to be one of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting employments to mankind. "The King him&s;elf is &s;erved from the field." But hu&s;bandry could never have flouri&s;hed without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the arts. Hence we find at a very early period, even long before the deluge, the arts were cultivated. Tubal-Cain is mentioned as an in&s;tructor of every artificer in bra&s;s and iron; and Jubal as a teacher of mu&s;ic, or the father of all &s;uch as handle the harp and organ: the u&s;e of the &s;quare and plumb were undoubtedly known at the time of the build|ing

of Babel; as were al&s;o the principles of archi|tecture to Noah, without which he could never have con&s;tructed &s;uch an a&s;toni&s;hing ve&s;&s;el as the Ark.</P>
<P>The motion and order of the heavenly bodies early arre&s;ted the attention of man. He beheld with rapture tho&s;e glittering orbs which adorned the &s;pangled firmament, and &s;hed their &s;oft lu&s;tre upon the mantle of night. In the book of Job, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been written by Mo&s;es, there are &s;ome things which lead us to conclude that they had con&s;iderable knowledge of a&s;tron|omy at this early period. This may be inferred from &s;everal things, be&s;ides the mention of "<HI>Arc|turus, Orion,</HI> and <HI>Pleiades.</HI>"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job, ix. 9.</NOTE></P>
<P>But we pa&s;s with rapidity over the&s;e di&s;tant ages to the deliverance of the cho&s;en tribes, in which the interpo&s;ition of Heaven was more vi&s;i|ble. Here we find Mo&s;es, rai&s;ed up of God, and eminently qualified to be the leader and deliverer of that people. The character of Mo&s;es, in &s;ome particulars, &s;tands unrivalled; e&s;pecially the pro|phetic part. As a General and a Legi&s;lator, he has rarely, if ever, been equalled. What a &s;acrifice he mu&s;t have made in exchanging the peaceful re|treats of Midian, for the noi&s;y honours of a camp! His magnanimous de&s;ign&mdash;the invincible firmne&s;s with which he pur&s;ued it (though ob&s;tructed by the mo&s;t unaccountable and unheard-of difficul|ties;)&mdash;the glorious things which he achieved for his nation;&mdash;above all, his godlike meekne&s;s un|der

the mo&s;t aggravating in&s;ults; have rendered his name as immortal as time! Jo&s;hua, who &s;uc|ceeded him, was very little, if at all, inferior to him in virtue or bravery. He conducted the tribes acro&s;s Jordan into the land of promi&s;e, and divided their inheritance by lot to them. After his death, for the &s;pace of four hundred years, their government &s;eems to have been irregularly admini&s;tered; and, at times, nearly reduced to a &s;tate of anarchy. Yet, in this period, God rai&s;|ed up &s;everal eminent men, who were honoured as the deliverers of their country: &s;uch were Gid|eon and Barak, Sam&s;on and Jephthah, of whom we cannot particularly &s;peak.</P>
<P>Let us now meditate a moment on the hi&s;tory of David. Here we behold a plea&s;ing a&s;&s;emblage of tho&s;e extraordinary qualities which dignify hu|man nature. His delicacy of behaviour when in|troduced to the royal family of Saul;&mdash;his &s;acred friend&s;hip to Jonathan;&mdash;his unrivalled valour in meeting, in &s;ingle combat, the huge champion of Gath, who&s;e gigantic appearance had &s;truck ter|ror through the whole Hebrew army;&mdash;above all, his fervent piety,&mdash;his devout attachment to the in&s;titutions of religion, and the &s;ublime &s;entiments of his poetic writings, will render his name il|lu&s;trious to all generations.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Humanity drops a tear, and then &s;preads a veil over his imperfections</NOTE> Solomon, who &s;uc|ceeded him, was di&s;tingui&s;hed by his wi&s;dom and riches; and, during his long and peaceful reign, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e rai&s;ed the Jewi&s;h throne to a degree of &s;plen|dour which it never exhibited before nor after|wards.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="036877_0011_100B29690A028000">
Had we time, we might notice &s;everal others of di&s;tingui&s;hed merit in that favoured nation, who&s;e hi&s;tory we have in the &s;acred pages; but if we turn to the Gentiles, we &s;hall find among them many &s;hining characters, who, by endeavouring to enlighten and reform their fellow-men, were emi|nently u&s;eful in their day, and ornaments to the age in which they lived. They are commonly known by the general appellation of <HI>Philo&s;ophers.</HI> Their names alone would fill a volume. Of the&s;e we can only notice three or four. <HI>Pythagoras,</HI> who was born at Samos, about 590 years before Chri&s;t, was much celebrated by the ancients. He travelled, for the &s;ake of obtaining knowl|edge, to Egypt, Babylon, and through vari|ous parts of Greece. And although he im|bibed many of the errors of the age in which he lived, he is &s;aid 'to have made con&s;iderable di&s;coveries in arts and &s;ciences, and delivered a great variety of precepts for civil and political con|duct.' It is remarked of <HI>Heraclitus,</HI> an Ephe&s;ian Philo&s;opher, who flouri&s;hed about two centuries after, that he 'continually bewailed the wicked lives of men, and as often as he came among them, to have fallen a weeping.' <HI>Socrates,</HI> who lived at the &s;ame time, or &s;oon after, made very con&s;ider|able improvement both in natural and moral phi|lo&s;ophy. He was convinced of the ab&s;urdity of polythei&s;m, and 'for deriding the plurality of the Heathen gods, was condemned to drink the juice of hemlock.' <HI>Plato,</HI> who was the di&s;ciple of Soc|rates, after &s;tudying with &s;everal other men of
<PB N="12" REF="036877_0012_100B296B89FDBD40">
great eminence, took a voyage into Egypt, where, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, he became acquainted with the Jew|i&s;h religion. He believed in one Supreme God, although he admitted other &s;ubordinate deities. He died 348 years before Chri&s;t. His &s;y&s;tem was generally received till long after the introduction of Chri&s;tianity; and by many of the ancient Fa|thers not unfrequently mixed with the doctrines of the Cro&s;s. But both natural and moral philo&s;o|phy, &s;ince the &s;pread of Chri&s;tianity, have emerg|ed from that darkne&s;s in which they were before enveloped.</P>
<P>Many things which were unknown to the an|cients, and others which were denied, through ig|norance and &s;uper&s;tition, are now e&s;tabli&s;hed be|yond the &s;hadow of a doubt. Among the mod|erns, who have explained the phenomena of na|ture, and rendered her laws more ea&s;y and intelli|gible, we may reckon a <HI>Copernicus,</HI> a <HI>Galileo,</HI> a <HI>Ga&s;|&s;endus,</HI> a <HI>Newton,</HI> and a <HI>Franklin.</HI> Their names are in&s;cribed upon the page of immortality. But I proceed to take notice of another cla&s;s of men, not le&s;s u&s;eful than the former.</P>
<P>As man could not enjoy, in a &s;tate of &s;olitude, all the happine&s;s he was de&s;igned for by his all-wi&s;e Creator; &s;o neither could he in a &s;tate of &s;ociety, without &s;ubmitting to the re&s;traints of law and order. Hence tho&s;e, whether in the character of Civilians, Legi&s;lators, or State&s;men, who have con|tributed to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of wi&s;e and equal laws; in order to protect the rights of the inno|cent, and bring the vicious to puni&s;hment, have
<PB N="13" REF="036877_0013_100B296E187E6E78">
been ju&s;tly con&s;idered among the friends of human happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Mo&s;es &s;tands foremo&s;t in this li&s;t. Many of his precepts, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of a moral nature, are practi&s;ed upon to this day, by different nations of different religions. The Gentiles, who had not this law, were a law to them&s;elves. <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> the fa|mous Lacedemonian Legi&s;lator, has been de&s;erved|ly celebrated. He reformed the government of the Spartans, and enacted a number of excellent laws, which he engaged them by a &s;olemn oath to keep until he &s;hould return from a journey he was about to make: being convinced of their great util|ity, and fearing they would relea&s;e them&s;elves from their oath in ca&s;e he returned, he put an end to his own life while ab&s;ent. <HI>Solon,</HI> the boa&s;t of Athens, and one of the wi&s;e&s;t men of his day, was ju&s;tly e&s;teemed as an excellent Civilian. He abrogated the laws of Draco, and enacted oth|ers more equitable; and taught, with &s;urpri&s;ing &s;ucce&s;s, the great principles of juri&s;prudence.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We may add to this li&s;t the names of <HI>Grotius, Monte&s;quieu, Hambden, Sidney,</HI> and the late noble Earl of Chatham, with many others.</NOTE></P>
<P>Permit me, my Brethren, al&s;o to ob&s;erve, that teachers of piety and morality have generally been received, and re&s;pected by all nations. It is &s;aid by an in&s;pired writer, that "the prie&s;t's lips &s;hould keep knowledge, and they &s;hould &s;eek the law at his mouth." Although, it mu&s;t be ac|knowledged, that &s;ome have di&s;honoured their &s;a|cred profe&s;&s;ion, and cau&s;ed the people to err; yet, I believe, that many have been, and ought to be,
<PB N="14" REF="036877_0014_100B297069EBAC98">
highly e&s;teemed for their works' &s;ake. How ven|erable did the Jewi&s;h High-Prie&s;t appear on the great day of atonement, when, clad in his &s;acer|dotal garments, he entered the mo&s;t holy place, and &s;prinkled the blood before the mercy-&s;eat! Yet in all this he was only a type of Him who was to come. Our great High-Prie&s;t has entered into heaven it&s;elf, and now appears in the pre&s;ence of God for us.</P>
<P>Often did this people relap&s;e into idolatry, and often God &s;ent his prophets to teach them the right way; and though they &s;inned with a high hand, yet he remembered his covenant with Abraham, I&s;aac and I&s;rael, and would not de&s;troy them. At length, the time to favour them drew nigh, and John the Bapti&s;t was &s;ent to announce the coming of the Son of God. "He was a burning and &s;hining light," and thou&s;ands of penitents rejoiced in the &s;alvation which he made known. He pointed his hearers to Je&s;us as the "Lamb of God who taketh away the &s;in of the world." The Apo&s;tles of our Lord, who were &s;upernaturally qualified and &s;ent forth to preach the go&s;pel, were made un&s;peakable ble&s;&s;ings to mankind. They not only preached the go&s;pel in Judea, but were &s;ent to enlighten the Gentile lands. They carried the knowledge of a Saviour with &s;urpri&s;ing &s;ucce&s;s throughout great part of the then habitable world. God has never left him&s;elf without witne&s;s, but has, in every age, rai&s;ed up &s;ome men of eminent abilities and piety, to teach the way of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and to oppo&s;e the errors of the day.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="036877_0015_100B29729C34E2E0">
In the fifteenth century, when &s;uper&s;tition and the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ignorance had over&s;pread great part of the Chri&s;tian world, God rai&s;ed up Luther and his cotemporaries to begin a glorious reformation; the principles of which have been gaining ground unto the pre&s;ent day. The &s;pirit of intolerance and per&s;ecution was not, however, wholly eradi|cated by the reformation: had it been, perhaps our forefathers had never left their native coun|try, and &s;ought an a&s;ylum upon the&s;e we&s;tern &s;hores. Deprived of the rights of con&s;cience at home, they were determined to &s;eek a better coun|try. Religious liberty was a primary object with the&s;e fir&s;t adventures. For the enjoyment of this, they were willing to make almo&s;t any &s;acrifice. The difficulties and delays they experienced in leav|ing their native country, the tediou&s;ne&s;s of their voyage, and the &s;ufferings and hard&s;hips they un|derwent in the beginning of their &s;ettlement here, would probably have &s;ubdued the fortitude of any &s;et of men actuated merely by worldly motives. But fired with a noble zeal for religion, they pre|ferred the privilege of wor&s;hipping God agreeably to the dictates of their own con&s;ciences (though in a de&s;ert) to all the enjoyments of this life. We have not time, nor would it comport with our de&s;ign, to trace their hi&s;tory; but would ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that in times of affliction and calamity, when they were neglected or oppre&s;&s;ed by a corrupt mini&s;try at home, and expo&s;ed in their infant &s;tate here to the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing dangers, they made God their refuge. He heard their cries, he &s;aw their

<P>We might here give you a long li&s;t of worthy names, who de&s;erved well of their country; but time forbids. We therefore ha&s;ten forward to that period, which brought into more public view the Man who&s;e death we this day lament.</P>
<P>Our injured country had long &s;een with ex|treme regret, their chartered rights violated, and an in&s;idious mini&s;try determined to deprive them of every ve&s;tige of rational liberty, and to &s;ubject them to the mo&s;t arbitrary impo&s;itions. They &s;aw their loyal humble petitions and remon&s;trances, either treated with total neglect, or con&s;trued into the voice of rebellion, and an armed force, prepared to give the la&s;t fatal blow to their expiring liber|ties, already &s;tationed among them. Driven to this extremity, they did not he&s;itate a moment be|tween death and &s;lavery! They made their &s;olemn appeal to Heaven, and determined to repel force by force.</P>
<P>At length the &s;torm bur&s;t!&mdash;the blood of our countrymen began to run!&mdash;their expiring groans mingling with the &s;moke of their di&s;&s;olving habita|tions a&s;cended up to heaven! Di&s;tre&s;s and anxiety were depicted in every countenance. Our affairs appeared in the mo&s;t perplexed, deranged &s;ituation conceivable; until by a wi&s;e choice dictated by the will of Heaven, our beloved WASHINGTON was appointed to the chief command of our ar|mies. The gloom now gradually di&s;appeared; and confidence in our public mea&s;ures increa&s;ed daily.

The army was &s;oon organized in the be&s;t manner po&s;&s;ible, and &s;ubordination and di&s;cipline were &s;o far e&s;tabli&s;hed, as in a &s;hort time to give our little camp a veteran appearance.</P>
<P>But perhaps &s;ome account of General WASH|INGTON, prior to his taking command of the American army in 1775, would be de&s;irable to a number pre&s;ent. It &s;hall be attempted. The ta&s;k is plea&s;ing; but I confe&s;s I feel a trembling diffi|dence in approaching a character &s;o venerable and &s;acred.</P>
<P>The ance&s;tors of this illu&s;trious Man came from England to this country in the year 1657. He was born in the pari&s;h of his own name in the county of We&s;tmoreland, in Virginia, on the 11th of Feb|ruary, 1732. His father died when he was only ten years old. Yet his education was properly at|tended to, and conducted principally by a private tutor. He early di&s;covered very uncommon tal|ents, connected with a mo&s;t enterpri&s;ing genius. Before he arrived to the age of twenty, he entered the military department with the rank of Major.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was &s;oon after advanced to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel, and before he was twenty-two to the chief command of the regiment.</NOTE> He di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf upon &s;everal occa&s;ions in his military character, before the memorable year 1755, when he achieved immortal honours, in conducting with &s;o much &s;kill and bravery the re|treat of General Braddock's defeated army. He continued in the &s;ervice of his country with increa&s;|ing reputation, until his ill &s;tate of health, in the year 1759, obliged him to re&s;ign his command.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="036877_0018_100B2978E791CA90">
He now enjoyed a rece&s;s from the toils of war for about the &s;pace of &s;ixteen years, in which he &s;edulou&s;ly cultivated the arts of peace: yet in this &s;pace, talents like his could not be exempted from the calls of a di&s;cerning public. Hence he frequently &s;erved his country as a Legi&s;lator, a Magi&s;trate, and a Judge. He was elected a Dele|gate to the fir&s;t Congre&s;s in 1774, and al&s;o the year following, until his appointment to the chief command of the army removed him from the council to the field.</P>
<P>Eight long years he continued in this command without compen&s;ation or reward. In reviewing the hard&s;hips and dangers, the anxieties and fa|tigues, which he mu&s;t have &s;uffered during that period; we may &s;ay of him as Jacob did of him|&s;elf, "In the day time the drought con&s;umed him, and the fro&s;t by night, and his &s;leep departed from his eyes." That &s;uperior wi&s;dom and invin|cible firmne&s;s which he di&s;played in every part of his conduct, &s;ecured to him the confidence of all, but e&s;pecially of the army. New &s;cenes of danger &s;erved only to bring into operation tho&s;e great tal|ents which &s;o eminently qualified him to meet the exigency of the moment. By a &s;urpri&s;ing &s;kill he &s;eemed to pervade the mo&s;t &s;ecret councils of his enemies; and by his timely, prudent caution, often defeated their mo&s;t dangerous, deep laid plots. His fame is by no means built on his having de|&s;troyed the mo&s;t lives, but on his having &s;aved them.</P>
<P>In &s;everal in&s;tances the fate of our country &s;eem|ed
<PB N="19" REF="036877_0019_100B297C38917DB8">
to hang in the mo&s;t doubtful &s;u&s;pen&s;e; particu|larly in the years 1776, and 1777. At the White Plains, it was evidently the de&s;ign of the Briti&s;h commanders to have brought the matter to an i&s;|&s;ue by a deci&s;ive pitched battle; they accordingly employed every art in their power for that pur|po&s;e. Our brave WASHINGTON beheld with painful regret the inferior &s;trength of his army, and well knew that he could not engage with any probability of &s;ucce&s;s; and yet to avoid it with honour, required more than Fabian &s;kill. He wi&s;ely fore&s;aw that a defeat at this time would probably have ruined our cau&s;e forever. There|fore both patrioti&s;m and humanity compelled him to decline a general action.</P>
<P>If we trace him in his retreat through the Jer|&s;eys, we &s;hall find him with &s;carce the appearance of an army. A little handful of brave, but half naked and barefoot troops, &s;till continued with him, and &s;upported the &s;tandard of liberty. Yet &s;oon after with this &s;mall force to the a&s;toni&s;hment of many, he re-cro&s;&s;ed the Delaware, and commenc|ing offen&s;ive operations, obtained &s;everal import|ant victories, which greatly animated the inhabit|ants of that State, and &s;eemed to give a new turn to the progre&s;s of the war.</P>
<P>To give a full account of the dangers he en|countered, and the victories he obtained, during our long &s;truggle for liberty, until lord Cornwal|lis, with his whole army, gave up to his &s;tandard, and &s;urrendered them&s;elves pri&s;oners of war,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This article was omitted at the delivery.</NOTE>

would far exceed the &s;peaker's abilities, or the limits of this di&s;cour&s;e. The &s;equel, will long be remembered by Britons as well as Americans.</P>
<P>When a peace was negociated by our amba&s;&s;a|dors in Europe, he received the intelligence, not with the indifference of a mercenary chief, who&s;e only &s;upport is derived from his profe&s;&s;ion; but with tho&s;e emotions of joy which are known only to patriotic minds. He immediately prepared to re&s;ign his command into the hands of tho&s;e from whom he received it. And even in the act of re|&s;igning, he appeared with equal dignity as in the embattled field. His farewel addre&s;s made a very &s;en&s;ible impre&s;&s;ion on people of all ranks, and &s;erv|ed to &s;trengthen their attachment to him. Thus ble&s;&s;ed by his liberated country, and covered with glory, he retired again to the peaceful &s;hades of Mount Vernon.</P>
<P>Four years had &s;carcely elap&s;ed, before we find him again publickly engaged in the cau&s;e of his country: In the year 1787 he was appointed by the State of Virginia a Delegate to the Convention which framed our excellent Con&s;titution, and in which he pre&s;ided. The year following, when this Con&s;titution was received and ratified by the States, and a Chief Magi&s;trate was to be cho&s;en, the eyes of all were at once fixed on him, whom they con&s;idered, under God, as the Deliverer of their country; and the enlightened freemen of America proclaimed as with one voice, WASH|INGTON IS THE MAN!</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="036877_0021_100B29810CE894A8">
However much his inclination might lead him to wi&s;h the plea&s;ures of retirement, the call of his country was too &s;acred to be di&s;regarded. He accepted their appointment, but with the greate&s;t diffidence and di&s;tru&s;t of his own abilities to di&s;|charge the important duties of his elevated and re&s;pon&s;ible &s;tation. He was a &s;econd time unani|mou&s;ly cho&s;en, and a &s;econd time he accepted. During the whole of his admini&s;tration, he exhib|ited all the attributes of magi&s;tracy in &s;uch an amiable and engaging light, as could not fail to &s;ecure the warme&s;t affection of the people over whom he pre&s;ided, and the mo&s;t re&s;pectful e&s;teem of foreign nations. In his military triumphs he has left a mo&s;t &s;olemn le&s;&s;on for tyrants, and in his civil admini&s;tration an excellent example for all future magi&s;trates. In his farewel addre&s;s he has left us a rich LEGACY, in which, although "being dead, he yet &s;peaketh." Let us careful|ly pre&s;erve it, and hand it down, as a mirror to po&s;terity to &s;ee him in, to the late&s;t ages. Perhaps it would not be &s;aying too much, to &s;ay, that no more unin&s;pired man was ever more beloved and re&s;pected than he was; nor their deaths more uni|ver&s;ally and &s;incerely lamented.</P>
<P>We proceed,</P>
<P>SECONDLY, to ob&s;erve, That when &s;uch highly re&s;pected characters are removed by death, ju&s;tice and gratitude demand a &s;uitable tribute of re&s;pect to be paid to their memories.</P>
<P>This &s;entiment being &s;o congenial with your feelings, upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, it will need little &s;aid to enforce it.</P>

The children of I&s;rael mourned for Mo&s;es in the plains of Moab thirty days. This was a na|tional act, and expre&s;&s;ive of their deep &s;orrow up|on this afflictive di&s;pen&s;ation. The death of Mo|&s;es differed in &s;ome re&s;pects from that of other men. He was particularly notified that it was at hand. Hence he employed the la&s;t month of his life in making immediate preparation for his final departure. He delivered a mo&s;t &s;olemn and affecting addre&s;s to his nation a little before he left them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Deut. xxxii.</NOTE> In this he recapitulated the many dangers they had e&s;caped, and pointed out tho&s;e to which they were &s;till expo&s;ed; and reminded them of the many pa&s;t interpo&s;itions of Divine Providence in their behalf; and concluded by &s;aying, "Set your hearts unto all the words which I te&s;tify among you this day, which ye &s;hall command your children to ob&s;erve to do." After this he proceeded from tribe to tribe, and left his fatherly ble&s;&s;ing with them; and by a &s;pirit of in&s;piration pointed out their future de&s;|tiny. From the tent of A&s;her, behold him a&s;|cending mount Nebo! See the tribes taking their la&s;t &s;ad look of their kind Deliverer! Every heart transfixed with grief, and every eye &s;wimming in tears! They watch his a&s;cending &s;teps, until he is lo&s;t from their &s;ight! Mo&s;es at length reached the towering top of Pi&s;gah, and from this lofty emi|nence he &s;urveyed "the land of Gilead&mdash;unto the utmo&s;t &s;ea, and the &s;outh, and the plains of the valley of Jericho, and the city of palm-trees unto

Zoar." Having thus &s;een the land of promi&s;e, he dropped the vail of mortality, as Elijah did his mantle, and a&s;cended to the bo&s;om of his God. He was now relea&s;ed from all his cares, and made happy in the man&s;ions of re&s;t; whil&s;t a bereaved nation was mourning on the plain below. This bears the greate&s;t re&s;emblance to our pre&s;ent &s;it|uation of any in&s;tance I recollect in the &s;acred pages. Mo&s;es, though con&s;iderably advanced in life, yet retained his full &s;trength; "his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated." He had not outlived his u&s;efulne&s;s, &s;o as to be half forgot|ten before he was dead; but retained the vigour of youth, enriched with the long experience of years.</P>
<P>Although his &s;ervices were &s;till eminently u&s;e|ful, and &s;eemed to be much needed, yet he had probably conducted that people through their greate&s;t dangers; and what was highly con&s;oling, had transferred his authority before his death to his worthy &s;ucce&s;&s;or, who was able to carry on the work which he had begun. You cannot help, my Brethren, ob&s;erving a coincidence of charac|ter and circum&s;tances, between the Jewi&s;h Law|giver and the American Patriot.</P>
<P>The beautiful <HI>Elegy</HI> of David, upon the death of Saul and Jonathan, is replete with all the fine &s;entiments of fraternal affection, and &s;ympathetic &s;orrow. The friend&s;hip between him and Jona|than had been long and uninterrupted; but Saul had been his per&s;ecutor for many years. Twice he had been delivered into his hands, and twice
<PB N="24" REF="036877_0024_100B29871CEBD2E8">
he had &s;pared his life. When one of his aids re|que&s;ted leave to &s;mite him to the earth at once; David replied, "De&s;troy him not: for who can &s;tretch forth his hand again&s;t the Lord's anointed, and be guiltle&s;s?" The time may come, &s;aid he, when "he &s;hall de&s;cend into battle and peri&s;h." The event had now taken place. It might have been &s;uppo&s;ed, that if David had not rejoiced at the fall of his greate&s;t foe, he would at lea&s;t have refrained from weeping. But he con&s;idered Saul as having been anointed at God's command, and ve&s;ted with &s;upreme authority; therefore he hon|oured him as the "mini&s;ter of God." The affect|ing circum&s;tances of his death, connecting with it that of his amiable &s;on, &s;ubdued all former re&s;ent|ment, and awakened in his &s;oul every tender &s;en|&s;ibility. His harp was now attuned to mourn|ing, and every &s;train warbled lamentation and woe. Forgetful of the former mi&s;carriages of Saul, he now indulges all the luxury of generous grief, and weeps at the awful &s;troke of fate, which lodged a father and a &s;on together in the cold arms of death, upon <HI>mount Gilboa.</HI> "The beauty of I&s;rael," &s;aid he, "is &s;lain upon thy high places; how are the mighty fallen!" They "were lovely and plea&s;ant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided. Ye daughters of I&s;rael, weep over Saul, who clothed you in &s;carlet with other delights, and put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel." And will not the fair daughters of Columbia weep for a far more amiable character, for our beloved WASHINGTON? Surely they
<PB N="25" REF="036877_0025_100B298BD79DC2D8">
will. When they con&s;ider how much they are indebted to his arduous toils, his &s;leeple&s;s nights, his coun&s;els and his care, for their pre&s;ent happine&s;s and pro&s;perity, I doubt not but they will partake largely in the general grief.</P>
<P>Our context exhibits further proof that the memories of the virtuous and the brave have ever been honoured. The Eulogy pronounced upon Abner; the character of the Orator; above all, the &s;orrowing tears of the audience, witne&s;&s;ed the high re&s;pect they had for the virtues of this brave, but unfortunate General.</P>
<P>Some of the Kings of I&s;rael, who di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves only for their wickedne&s;s, were denied the privilege of being buried in the &s;epulchres of their fathers; whil&s;t &s;uch as were virtuous and reigned well, never failed of being honoured both in life and death. When Hezekiah died, "they buried him in the chiefe&s;t of the &s;epulchres of the &s;ons of David, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jeru&s;alem did him honour at his death." But how do all the in&s;tances of public grief, which are to be met with in &s;acred and profane hi&s;tory, di|mini&s;h to a point, when compared with that which was exhibited at the death of CHRIST?</P>
<P>When the SAVIOUR of men expired upon Calva|ry, nature, &s;u&s;pending her u&s;ual gaieties, threatened the return of univer&s;al chaos. The pained rocks bur&s;t a&s;under! The groaning earth trembled to its centre! The &s;un &s;hrouded him&s;elf in black, and the world was curtained round in awful dark|ne&s;s!&mdash;The daughters of Jeru&s;alem followed him

to the fatal place weeping! The di&s;ciples &s;tood afar off beholding! Many of the crowd who beheld the &s;ight, &s;mote upon their brea&s;ts, and withdrew from the affecting &s;cene. The death of JESUS will be gratefully remembered, and frequently celebrat|ed by Chri&s;tians to the late&s;t ages of time. Any attempt to &s;well our pre&s;ent grief to a compari&s;on with this, would be mo&s;t &s;olemn trifling. Yet our lo&s;s is great indeed.</P>
<P>The Man, who was de&s;tined by Heaven to be the in&s;trumental Saviour of his country; who went before our armies, and conducted them &s;afe|ly amid&s;t perils and dangers, and who led them on to final victory; the Man who pre&s;ided over our national councils with &s;o much honour, and who&s;e admini&s;trations bore the mo&s;t dignified marks of wi&s;dom, prudence and integrity; "the man who was rai&s;ed up on high"&mdash;Alas! we &s;hall &s;ee his face no more.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved by an ingenious writer, that when that celebrated &s;tate&s;man and friend to univer&s;al liberty, the late noble Earl of Chatham, was inter|red, the tide of public grief and re&s;pect ro&s;e high|er, than had been ever known before upon a &s;im|ilar occa&s;ion; and &s;uch as was not u&s;ual even at the funeral of kings.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bel&s;ham's Memoirs of Geo. III.</NOTE> But, my Brethren, what is all the funeral pomp which attends the exit of kings, compared with that generous &s;orrow which at this moment oppre&s;&s;es the bo&s;om of every American? Our tears are not a tribute extorted from us by cu&s;tom, but the genuine expre&s;&s;ions of
<PB N="27" REF="036877_0027_100B2990CB29B250">
our heartfelt grief. We humbly hope our Divine Ma&s;ter will not be offended with our mourning for the Man whom we &s;o much loved, &s;ince he him&s;elf wept at the grave of Lazarus.</P>
<P>It becomes us upon the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion to min|gle with our &s;orrows, the voice of thank&s;giving, to that God who&s;e coun&s;els are un&s;earchable, and his ways pa&s;t finding out. We will adore him, that he has honoured our nation to give birth to one of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious of men; who has very ju&s;tly been con&s;idered as 'the pride of his country,' and the admiration of the world. Let us adore the God of Armies who covered his head in the day of battle, and who &s;u&s;tained him amid&s;t &s;o many tri|als and dangers. Nor have we le&s;s cau&s;e of thank|fulne&s;s, that he was enabled to di&s;charge with &s;o much wi&s;dom and integrity, the very difficult and important duties of his re&s;pon&s;ible &s;tation as Su|preme Executive of the Union. While we mourn his &s;udden departure from us, we have great rea|&s;on to acknowledge that goodne&s;s which &s;pared him to us &s;o long. That he did not fall upon the high places of the field, by the hand of his ene|mies; nor "by the hand of wicked men," like the man who is the &s;ubject of our text; but that Heaven, who cannot err, appointed the time, the in&s;trument, and the manner of his death. Let us with reverence &s;ubmit to the awful di&s;pen&s;a|tion; and be careful that we do not offend God, by any indecent expre&s;&s;ions of our grief. How|ever much he was honoured and revered, he was but a man; and we know that "it is better to

tru&s;t in the Lord, than to put confidence in prin|ces:" for though they are called gods, they mu&s;t die like men. Could the fond wi&s;hes of his coun|try, or the tears of his &s;urrounding friends, have delayed the awful &s;troke;&mdash;WASHINGTON had not died. But the &s;entence was irrevocable! He &s;ub|mitted to it with calmne&s;s, and we tru&s;t his nobler part is gone to that world, where virtue receives its full reward. Gratitude &s;hall erect upon his tomb a la&s;ting monument in&s;cribed with his worthy deeds; whil&s;t his precious du&s;t &s;hall re&s;t in peace beneath its hallowed ba&s;e, until the Archangel &s;hall wake the &s;leeping dead.</P>
