<HEAD>The Rev. Mr. <HI>Maccarthy</HI>'s Account of the Behaviour of Mrs. <HI>Spooner</HI> after her Commitment and Condemnation for being Acce&s;&s;ary in the Murder of her Hu&s;band at <HI>Brookfield,</HI> <DATE>March 1. 1778.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>MRS. <HI>Spooner</HI> profe&s;&s;ed that her match with her Hu&s;band was not agreeable to her&punc;&mdash; Dome&s;tic di&s;&s;entions &s;oon took place, and went on from &s;tep to &s;tep, till &s;he conceived an utter aver|&s;ion to him; at length &s;he meditated his de&s;truc|tion; laid &s;everal plans, and never gave over till the fatal act was committed. Her guilt in this manner appeared in mo&s;t flagrant colours upon her trial as well as &s;ince, from the &s;olemn declaration of the poor men whom &s;he employed in the bloody deed, and to whom &s;he promi&s;ed a large reward, which reward they immediately received.</P>
<P>I &s;oon vi&s;ited her after her commitment. She was not very free to conver&s;e upon the &s;ubject. And indeed it was difficult to conver&s;e freely upon it till after her trial. After this, opportunity was given in the fulle&s;t manner. She did not blame judges or jurors or the Attorney-General, but often declared that the witne&s;&s;es wronged her. She declared, that <HI>though &s;he had planned the matter, yet that &s;he never thought it would be executed; that &s;he relented when &s;he found they were in earne&s;t.</HI> She doubtle&s;s could have given her hu&s;band notice of what was de&s;igned, and &s;o have prevented it, but &s;he did not; nor did &s;he make di&s;covery of
<PB N="2" REF="043485_0002_101D0B77A6D9FFC8">
it as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible but &s;ent the next morning to a neighbour's to enquire after him, when at the &s;ame time &s;he knew he was in the well. She could not be brought to acknowledge her guilt or the ju&s;tne&s;s of her &s;entence till very late in the day, as &s;hall be mentioned. It &s;eems &s;he went upon this mi&s;taken principle that &s;he was not an immediate actor. She was a per&s;on of uncommon fortitude of mind, did not for the mo&s;t part appear to be affected with many circum&s;tances in her ca&s;e which were wont deeply to affect others. She would indeed &s;ometimes &s;ay, that &s;he felt more than &s;he did or could expre&s;s. Seldom a day pa&s;&s;ed but I vi&s;ited her, for which &s;he expre&s;&s;ed great gratitude. I was wont to conver&s;e with her upon the main point, and to endeavour to impre&s;s her mind with a &s;en&s;e of her guilt, hoping to ob|&s;erve upon her the &s;ymptoms of true penitence. Appearances of this were from time to time di&s;|couraging.</P>
<P>Her behaviour to all was very polite and complai&s;ant. From the frequent opportunities I had with her, I was led to conceive of her, as a per&s;on naturally of a kind, obliging, generous di&s;po&s;ition. But &s;he was unhappy, as above mentioned, in her fir&s;t &s;etting out in the world, and &s;o left to a fatal capital crime.</P>
<P>It appeared to many that carefully ob&s;erv<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">d her for many weeks before her execution, that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">e was in a &s;tate of pregnancy. She accordingly petitioned authority for a re&s;pite. A jury of ma|trons was appointed to examine her. They did

not bring in in her favour; &s;he petitioned again but it was not granted; accordingly execution was ordered; &s;he received the tidings with great calm|ne&s;s. At her own de&s;ire, that the public might be &s;atisfied, &s;he was opened the evening after the execution, and a perfect male <HI>foetus</HI> of the growth of five months, or near it, in the judgment of the operators, was taken from her. Having under|gone a &s;econd examination a few days before her execution, and being thereby greatly di&s;ordered, &s;he was not able to attend the &s;ermon that day.</P>
<P>Soon after it, I went to the goal with a number of my brethren; &s;he appeared very calm, humble and penitent, profe&s;&s;ed her faith in the great &s;aviour and dependance upon him; upon its being propo&s;ed to her, &s;he readily con&s;ented to be bap|tized; &s;he was &s;o immediately, as but a few mo|ments remained before &s;he mu&s;t go forth. The &s;cene was very &s;olemn and affecting; &s;he was not at all daunted when the &s;heriff pre&s;ented her with and put on the fatal cord; &s;he told him &s;he e&s;teemed it as much as though he had put on a necklace of gold or diamonds. She pre&s;ently went forth, I accompanied her in a carriage to the place of execution; &s;he appeared undi&s;mayed and unaffrighted at the various &s;triking &s;cenes that opened from one &s;tage to another. At length we came in &s;ight of the gallows, I a&s;ked her if the &s;ight of it did not &s;trike her? She an&s;wered not at all any more than any other object. Her con|&s;titutional politene&s;s &s;till remained, and &s;he di&s;|covered it to numbers that were near her. She
<PB N="4" REF="043485_0004_101D0B810B8F88A0">
pre&s;ently mounted the &s;caffold, and while the &s;heriff was fixing her, &s;he told him, with a &s;erene countenance, <HI>that it was the happie&s;t day &s;he ever &s;aw, for &s;he doubted not it would be well with her.</HI> She acknowledged <HI>that &s;he ju&s;tly died; that &s;he hoped to &s;ee her chri&s;tian friends &s;he left behind her, in Heaven, but that none of them might go there in the ignominious manner that &s;he did.</HI> It was a fixed principle with her, that confe&s;&s;ion of her faults was proper only to be made to her maker, not to men; &s;he often declared, <HI>that &s;he was not neglectful of this and found &s;atisfaction in &s;o doing</HI>; but at the la&s;t ca&s;t, &s;he did this at lea&s;t implicitly to the &s;heriff, as ju&s;t related.</P>
<P>I would be far from pre&s;uming to decide upon her future &s;tate or that of the re&s;t of them.&mdash; I &s;hall only add a &s;hort extract from the &s;ermon I deliver'd to my people the Lord's-day following.</P>
<P><HI>"We know what are the infinite compa&s;&s;ions of God, and that the blood of Je&s;us is of infinite value, clean&s;ing from all unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, We may by no means limit the holy one of I&s;rael. We read of the &s;ervant that came in at the eleventh hour, who received the &s;ame wages as tho&s;e who had borne the burden and heat of the day. We know what was done by our Saviour to the penitent thief upon the cro&s;s, ju&s;t before he expired. This &s;hows us what divine power and grace can do and may do. But &s;ecret things belong to God, and we ought to leave them with him."</HI></P>
