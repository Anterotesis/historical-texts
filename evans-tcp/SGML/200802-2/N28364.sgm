</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the gay and di&s;&s;olute reign of Charles the &s;econd, when wit was almo&s;t as general as licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s, and a happy vivacity and good per&s;on the &s;ure&s;t recommendations, Henry Arundel was di&s;tingui&s;hed from a crowd of fa&s;hionable liber|tines, by a &s;uperiority of elegance, ta&s;te and ex|travagance: in a word, for all tho&s;e &s;educing al|lurements which lend a charm to vice in every age, and for which that was particularly re|markable.</P>
<P>Arundel, though not wholly de&s;erving of the lavi&s;h admiration he every where extorted, had advantages few men could boa&s;t. His figure was graceful; and, what is often thought &s;till better, it was fa&s;hionable: his eyes, naturally fine, had the art of &s;aying the prettie&s;t things in the world
<PB N="6" REF="037796_0004_100F5293B0D56378">
to every pretty woman: his manners were ingra|tiating: he &s;ung well, danced well, and dre&s;&s;ed well. Could any thing further be added to his character? Yet, with all the&s;e advantages&mdash;&s;trange does it &s;eem to &s;ay&mdash;Arundel was at heart a di&s;contented man. Highly as the world thought of him, there was an individual in it who&s;e opi|nion ro&s;e much beyond theirs: it was him&s;elf: and he &s;ecretly repined, that &s;o much merit, ta|lents, and grace, had never yet rai&s;ed him to a rank above that he was born to.</P>
<P>Mr. Arundel was indeed of good family; though, to his uncea&s;ing regret, he had early in life deba&s;ed him&s;elf by marrying a lady who&s;e connections did not add lu&s;tre to it. She was the daughter of an officer of more loyalty than rank, who had &s;erved his country in the cau&s;e of Charles the fir&s;t, and had followed the fortunes of his &s;on.</P>
<P>Cromwell was then protector: dancing and dre&s;&s;ing were not in fa&s;hion; and mr. Arundel con&s;equently re&s;ided with his lady on his patri|monial e&s;tate in Cornwall. Some years pa&s;&s;ed before they had any children, when he was &s;ur|pri&s;ed with an heir, and rather more &s;urpri&s;ed on finding him&s;elf &s;oon afterwards a widower.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="037796_0005_100F52BCA8F65FB8">
Never truly alive either to conjugal or parental affection, he expre&s;&s;ed little regret on the lo&s;s of an amiable wi&s;e, nor any great emotion at &s;ight of her offspring. Decent care, however, was taken of the child; and as all England became in&s;en|&s;ibly engro&s;&s;ed by politics, his father thought oftener of them than of the little Henry.</P>
<P>The Re&s;toration of Charles the &s;econd gave that lu&s;tre to London to which it had long been a &s;tranger. Henry Arundel had only to &s;hew him&s;elf there to be admired: his per&s;on won the ladies&mdash;his addre&s;s the monarch; and from a neglected country gentleman, he found him&s;elf in a few years the idol of a gay and elegant court. Rapidly as the change was effected, it yet could not fail to bring with it &s;ome knowledge of the world. He began to think him&s;elf born to fill the mo&s;t elevated rank there; and regretted too late the having entailed a tax both on his e&s;tate and his plea&s;ures, and perhaps prepared a rival at a time of life when he was likely to find him&s;elf but lit|tle di&s;po&s;ed to endure one.</P>
<P>Mr. Arundel, it may ea&s;ily be judged, was not a man of principle: he therefore formed rather a re&s;olution than a plan; and, without exactly an|aly&s;ing
<PB N="8" REF="037796_0006_100F52959AA78C20">
his own motives. &s;ent his &s;on, at two years of age, into France, under the care of a per&s;on who had once been his mi&s;tre&s;s, and who&s;e declining health induced her to try a more &s;ettled climate than her own. The woman had her in|&s;tructions. The birth of young Henry was care|fully concealed; and her death, which happened three years after, left the child in the hands of &s;trangers, at a &s;mall Engli&s;h &s;chool in Normandy, where an annual &s;tipend freed his father from all further anxiety: from the relations of his decea&s;ed wife he had nothing to fear: mo&s;t of them were dead: the re&s;t were wanderers over the Conti|nent; di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the ingratitude of a monarch whom they had abandoned every thing to &s;erve.</P>
<P>Time now rolled rapidly away in vanity and plea&s;ure; but time, though it had not yet robbed mr. Arundel of his graces, had produced an in|&s;en&s;ible alteration in them: that of novelty was vani&s;hing fa&s;t. He began only to plea&s;e, where he was accu&s;tomed to captivate; and had even &s;ome vague &s;urmi&s;es, that he might &s;oon cea&s;e to do either, when fortune re&s;olved, by one &s;troke, to atone for all her pa&s;t inattention.</P>
<P>The young heire&s;s of the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of
<PB N="9" REF="037796_0007_100F52BF0BB2C810">
Lind&s;ey was at that period fir&s;t pre&s;ented at court. She was beautiful, rich, and had ju&s;t &s;een enough of the world to value all the graces it be&s;tows. Arundel caught her eye, while his was directed el&s;ewhere: the &s;uperior elegance of his per&s;on fixed her attention; and when he was introduced, a &s;ofter &s;entiment &s;unk into her heart. He was &s;till enough the fa&s;hion to make his name a theme of conver&s;ation, as &s;he dropped it among&s;t her ac|quaintance; nor was it long before he di&s;covered that &s;he had done &s;o often. The <HI>denou&euml;ment</HI> it is not difficult to gue&s;s: he pre&s;ently found that he might win the lady, and therefore in&s;tantly re|&s;olved that he would; but the blind godde&s;s, who &s;o often embitters her own gifts, was now preparing one for him, which, of all others, he lea&s;t &s;u&s;pected he &s;hould ever deem a misfortune, &s;ince it appeared in the &s;hape of a patent of nobi|lity. To the nobility in his own per&s;on, indeed, he bore not the &s;lighte&s;t objection; but the clau&s;e by which it was limited to his heirs, unluckily brought to his recollection a poor little boy in France, who was ju&s;t beginning to wonder to whom he belonged, whenever he found time to do &s;o from the more important employments of &s;tudying bad Latin, and playing &s;chool pranks with his companions; yet this poor little boy had
<PB N="10" REF="037796_0008_100F52994782D230">
mo&s;t certainly been brought honourably into the world, &s;ome years before. Arundel well knew the hou&s;e of Lind&s;ey to be too proud to &s;toop to an <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> where &s;uch an ob&s;tacle intervened: he therefore very prudently determined they never &s;hould know it. The marriage articles were &s;igned without any &s;uch impediment being an|nounced; and mi&s;s Lind&s;ey became a wife and a mother, in the full conviction that both families were indebted to her for an heir.</P>
<P>And what became of little Henry?&mdash;Why, little Henry was now &s;hot up beyond his years; not &s;trictly hand&s;ome, yet winning; not formed, yet ingratiating: light traces of &s;en&s;ibility and judgment wandered over the glare of youth, like clouds upon &s;un&s;hine, and gave his character a graceful &s;hade. The impo&s;&s;ibility of detaining him where he was, and the fear of detection when he arrived at maturity, had obliged his fa|ther to change his mode of education; and he had con&s;igned him to a tutor, who, though ap|prized of the &s;ecret, was bound by many ties to conceal it.</P>
<P>Mr. Mortimer&mdash;for &s;uch was the name which the above-mentioned gentleman cho&s;e on this oc|ca&s;ion
<PB N="11" REF="037796_0009_10121817613A12B0">
to a&s;&s;ume&mdash;had once been the companion of mr. Arundel, before he was dignified with the title of lord Lind&s;ey; and had pa&s;&s;ed in his &s;ociety &s;ome of tho&s;e hours, the recollection of which &s;hould &s;eem to unite man to man, if the experi|ence of every day did not prove the di&s;tinction between joviality and friend&s;hip. To &s;ay truth, mr. Mortimer's character, while yet immatured by adver&s;ity, did not &s;eem to demand or de&s;erve &s;uperior regard; and was one of tho&s;e which, for want of a deci&s;ive <HI>trait,</HI> the world has agreed to di&s;tingui&s;h by the epithet of <HI>ea&s;y.</HI> Prodigal without being rich, and di&s;&s;olute without being vicious, he found him&s;elf at fifty a wanderer from his family, friendle&s;s, and impoveri&s;hed; and was contented to accept an annuity from lord Lind|&s;ey, under &s;uch re&s;trictions as every day con|vinced him were both cruel and mean.</P>
<P>"Let the boy want nothing that a moderate in|come can &s;upply!"&mdash;Such were the words of his lord&s;hip's letter to Mortimer: "Let him travel&mdash;if, as you &s;ay, he fancies it, and can do it with|out additional expence: but, above all, &s;eize the fir&s;t opportunity of an attachment to marry him, and &s;ettle his e&s;tabli&s;hment in &s;ome province which he may never think of quitting.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="037796_0010_1012181555F2F138">
"You know my &s;ituation&mdash;Lady Lind&s;ey is in a dying &s;tate:&mdash;The phy&s;icians even threaten me with a voyage to Li&s;bon. My &s;on requires all the indulgences &s;uitable to the importance of his rank; and, indeed, my employments at court do not allow me to retrench. From the&s;e circum|&s;tances, you will conclude how little I am able to &s;upply any extraordinary expence. As to my own &s;tate of health, it is much as u&s;ual. The gout and rheumati&s;m, indeed, make pretty fre|quent attacks upon me; and I have &s;ome returns of the giddine&s;s in my head. The&s;e excepted, I find my&s;elf as young, and as well di&s;po&s;ed to en|joy the plea&s;ures of life, as at five-and-twenty."</P>
<P>Such was the language of five-and-fifty!&mdash;Such <HI>was</HI>&mdash;May I not &s;ay, &s;uch is it every day?</P>
<P>But though loud Lind&s;ey perceived not the al|teration in him&s;elf, the world was not &s;o com|plai&s;ant: His friends found out that he was weak; his enemies, that he was unprincipled: the old thought him too young; and the young di&s;|covered daily that he was too old. In two points only were they all agreed; that he was an impe|rious hu&s;band and a fooli&s;hly fond father.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="037796_0011_100F52C091F15688">
"What is it that takes your attention &s;o much?" &s;aid Mortimer to his pupil, as they jogged on towards Bru&s;&s;els in a du&s;ty <HI>chai&s;e de po&s;te,</HI> am|ply filled with two gentlemen and a raw-boned Swi&s;s, who &s;erved both as valet: "Is it the mag|cificent &s;uite that has ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed us, or the pow|dered coxcombs in it?"</P>
<P>"It is an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> carriage," replied Henry, &s;till following it with his eyes, through the cloud of du&s;t in which its rapid movement had involved their more humble vehicle.</P>
<P>"So much the wor&s;e," returned the other. "Would not a man &s;wear, from its &s;tructure, that it was the temple of luxury? One might really &s;uppo&s;e that the joints of our modern men of fa&s;hion&mdash;" a violent jolt that brought his head in rather too clo&s;e a contact with that of the Swi&s;s interrupted his &s;peech, which was as &s;uddenly drowned by the po&s;tillions, who, clack|ing their whips, gave notice of the po&s;t-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The carriage <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">at had pa&s;&s;ed them &s;tood at the door as they drew up. It was an Engli&s;h po&s;t|chariot, elegantly built, followed by two grooms, &s;o perfectly <HI>&agrave; l' Anglai&s;e</HI> as to attract univer&s;al at|tention:
<PB N="14" REF="037796_0012_100F529F8C8B3E20">
one of whom led a capital hor&s;e, which, by its appearance, &s;eemed de&s;igned for his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>"Lewis, open the door, and bring up <HI>Comete,</HI>" &s;aid a young man, touching the &s;pring of the blind, and di&s;covering both him&s;elf and his com|panion at full to the curious eyes of our travel|lers&mdash;"I'll ride the next po&s;t!"</P>
<P>"Not on that hor&s;e!" interrupted an elderly gentleman in black at his elbow, in a tone which, as it &s;eemed preliminary to much longer expo&s;tu|lation, made his companion &s;pring with &s;ome abruptne&s;s from the carriage.</P>
<P>A form light, graceful, elegant; a countenance lighted up with all the bloom and fire of nine|teen, at once fixed the eyes of Henry and his tutor. It was not mere beauty, it was vigour&mdash;it was intelligence&mdash;it was character, that &s;eemed to live in the motion, and &s;peak in the features, of the young &s;tranger.</P>
<P>"I am afraid, gentlemen," &s;aid he, advancing, "that we are robbing you of hor&s;es!" ca&s;ting his eyes upon tho&s;e his <HI>avant-courier</HI> had indeed &s;e|cured;
<PB N="15" REF="037796_0013_100F52C22C4B2068">
and, by the &s;ame motion, directing the attention of Mortimer to a melancholy truth, which the po&s;t-ma&s;ter, after conde&s;cending to mention once to the Swi&s;s, had left them to dige&s;t at lei&s;ure. Clamour, fretting, and altercation &s;ucceeded on all parts, except on tho&s;e of Henry and the young &s;tranger, who &s;eemed on terms of perfect familiarity, before their graver tutors had exchanged ten words.</P>
<P>"The matter is very ea&s;ily arranged," &s;aid the young man: "Do you, &s;ir," turning to Morti|mer, "take my place in the carriage: my &s;er|vant's hor&s;e (which was a beautiful creature) &s;hall be at this gentleman's &s;ervice. I will ride my own; and our fellows have only to wait an hour or two, and follow in your carriage as &s;oon as a fre&s;h reinforcement arrives.</P>
<P>To this propo&s;al a &s;ort of doubtful pau&s;e &s;uc|ceeded, which was broken by the gentleman in black, who, in a peevi&s;h tone, exclaimed, "I have told you, &s;ir, you ought never to ride that hor&s;e again!"</P>
<P>"Nay, pr'ythee, Walbrook," returned the other, gaily, "no more mu&s;ty debates!&mdash;Had he
<PB N="16" REF="037796_0014_100F52A29586B248">
really broken my neck in his la&s;t frolic, as you &s;eemed to apprehend, the world would not per|haps have been much the lo&s;er. My &s;teed, gen|tlemen," added he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf on the the other &s;ide, "is &s;o much of my own ta&s;te, as to have an in&s;tinctive aver&s;ion to every thing old or ugly; and having ye&s;terday the misfortune to be &s;urpri&s;ed by a &s;hrivelled Dutch hag &s;itting un|der a hedge, he took the liberty of di&s;mounting his ma&s;ter.&mdash;But, <HI>allons, mes amis!</HI>&mdash;I like him not the wor&s;e for it.&mdash;Give me a hor&s;e that will follow a <HI>pretty</HI> woman half the world over, and I'll compound for a few vagaries at &s;ight of an ugly one." Without waiting a reply, he &s;prung into the &s;addle, ca&s;t a look of invitation, which was in&s;tantly complied with, on Arundel, and, touching his hat to the &s;eniors, both gentlemen were out of &s;ight in a moment. Walbrook groaned inwardly; Mortimer &s;hrugged; the po&s;|tillions again clacked their whips, and the car|riage rattled once more over the <HI>pav&eacute;.</HI></P>
<P>"Is the old gentleman behind us your father, or your tutor?" &s;aid the younger &s;tranger, check|ing his hor&s;e that his valet might tie up his hair, which, from the velocity of their motion, had got loo&s;e and &s;lowed over his &s;houlders.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="037796_0015_100F52C491314E60">
"<HI>Both, perhaps!</HI>" cried Truth, in the bo&s;om of Arundel, though his tongue in&s;tinctively pro|nounced, "Neither. He is my friend!"</P>
<P>"A mo&s;t <HI>reverend</HI> one!" &s;aid the other, archly.</P>
<P>"A kind one," returned Arundel, "and a wi&s;e one!&mdash;He gives me the be&s;t advice po&s;&s;ible."</P>
<P>"So will I&mdash;<HI>gratis,</HI> too! and there, perhaps, I have the advantage of him!"</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t &s;eek it fir&s;t, I believe," retorted Henry, &s;miling.</P>
<P>"Not far&mdash;I have it in folio&mdash;on my cha&s;e! I love an old friend as well as you do, when I can carry him in my imperial; and to make the matter ea&s;ier, my friend is my father."</P>
<P>"And who may this father be?" thought A|rundel&mdash;yet he had not the courage to a&s;k. The note of interrogation &s;o common with travellers, was not yet familiar to him: yet had he lived with Frenchmen, and, <HI>par hazard,</HI> had been a&s;ked almo&s;t every po&s;&s;ible que&s;tion with that polite imperti|nence a Frenchman &s;o thoroughly under&s;tands.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="037796_0016_100F52A431FD0AF8">
But while glowing youth and exhilarated &s;pi|rits thus cemented the liking of the two juvenile travellers, their &s;ober tutors were far from parti|cipating their &s;entiments. Life, like the magnet, has two points; the one does not more forcibly attract, than the other can repel; and our party <HI>quarr&eacute;</HI> were &s;tationed at the&s;e oppo&s;ite extre|mities.</P>
<P>Yet were not either mr. Walbrook or mr. Mortimer without curio&s;ity: from the former, however, a name had e&s;caped which plunged his companion in a profound <HI>reverie;</HI> nor was it till a fla&s;k of Burgundy gave fre&s;h circulation to his &s;pirits that he appeared to recover him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"Mr. Lind&s;ey, your gla&s;s!" &s;aid Walbrook, who was al&s;o beginning to relinqui&s;h his &s;uperci|lious taciturnity.</P>
<P>Mortimer &s;tarted again at the name; again looked at the young man who bore it; and again a vague and painful &s;entiment of remor&s;e, enforced by the conviction that his &s;urmi&s;es were right, &s;hot acro&s;s his heart.&mdash;The countenance of the &s;tranger, his arms, his liveries, his age, all united to prove that he could be no other than the bro|ther of Arundel&mdash;his <HI>younger</HI> brother, yet per|mitted
<PB N="19" REF="037796_0017_100F52C78F3A2D98">
to invade his rights&mdash;to annihilate, as it &s;hould &s;eem, his very exi&s;tence. Again Morti|mer &s;ighed, and again relap&s;ed into u&s;ele&s;s reverie. For there is a weakne&s;s in certain minds, which renders them alternately the prey of plea&s;ure and remor&s;e, without power to perpetuate the one, or profit by the other; as the wilde&s;t trees will put forth blo&s;&s;oms, though they require culture and attention to produce fruits.</P>
<P>"A bumper, gentlemen!" &s;aid Walbrook. "I mean to give you a toa&s;t&mdash;My worthy friend and patron, lord Lind&s;ey!"</P>
<P>"My father!" &s;aid the young &s;tranger, as he negligently lifted the gla&s;s to his lips. The &s;e|cret monitor in the bo&s;om of Mortimer &s;mote him again&mdash;"<HI>Father!</HI>" repeated he, as he ca&s;t his eyes upon Henry: "yet, is the di&s;covery new to me?&mdash;No! but the epithet is: and what is an epithet?"&mdash;Thus arrogantly argued rea&s;on, while mode&s;t feeling &s;hrunk aba&s;hed.&mdash;Feeling, that indefinable union of the material and immaterial nature; that &s;pontaneous &s;en&s;e of right which would &s;o often guide when rea&s;on would mi&s;lead us; and which, though rejected and rebuked, &s;till calls a blu&s;h into the cheek if the idea &s;ophi&s;|tically
<PB N="20" REF="037796_0018_100F52A81697D810">
familiarized to our own bo&s;oms, is inad|vertently obtruded by the lips of another.</P>
<P>But the&s;e are metaphy&s;ics!&mdash;Metaphy&s;ics in Flanders! We &s;hall talk logic next among the Iroquois in North America. Let us change the &s;cene then and place our travellers, now &s;worn and bo&s;om friends, three whole weeks back, in France&mdash;<HI>France!</HI> lovely country! let me &s;top to weep over thee!&mdash;to a&s;k, where are the nobles who&s;e valour once graced, the pea&s;antry who&s;e mirth enlivened thee!&mdash;the monarch, over who&s;e early and unmerited grave the generous and en|lightened of every nation &s;hed tears of pity!&mdash;And you, &s;avage band of ruffians, who to the hideous idol ye mi&s;called Liberty daily offered up a &s;acrifice of human blood, and tears more painful than blood, deem not that your names &s;hall be mentioned&mdash;your memories be tran&s;mitted to po&s;|terity&mdash;but, as the &s;cum of that mighty ma&s;s, which, "billowed high with human agitation," mu&s;t at la&s;t purify it&s;elf!</P>
<P>As yet, however, France was a country. It had arts; it had manufactures; it had even a police&mdash;a bad one, indeed; but a police that at lea&s;t allowed its inhabitants to carry their heads
<PB N="21" REF="037796_0019_100F52C9D6A1EA30">
upon their &s;houlders in perference to a pike&mdash;that occa&s;ionally plundered them of their money, but made it no crime that they had &s;ome to be plun|dered of&mdash;that often &s;tript the beautiful plant of genius of its leaves, but never buried it beneath that coar&s;e and rugged &s;oil which bla&s;ts its very root.</P>
<P>"Will nobody teach the&s;e fellows that they are mi&s;erable?" &s;aid Lind&s;ey, &s;miling, as they pa&s;&s;ed through the beautiful grounds of the duc de T&mdash;, where the pea&s;ants, collected under the trees, were capering to the indefatigable violin of an old man, who performed the double cha|racter of fiddler and dancing-ma&s;ter, by ince&s;&s;antly bawling out every change in the cotillon, with an exertion of lungs that &s;eemed to con&s;ole him for the quie&s;cent &s;tate of his heels, "Will nobody, I &s;ay, per&s;uade the&s;e people they are mi&s;erable?"</P>
<P>"It is more than probable," &s;aid Arundel, "that they will &s;oon need but little per&s;ua&s;ion to think &s;o. They want every thing towards happi|ne&s;s, but good-humour and good &s;pirits."</P>
<P>"And tho&s;e &s;ome generous mi&s;anthrope or other&mdash;&s;ome &s;peculative rea&s;oner, who &s;eeks in

his head for what he ought to a&s;k of his heart, will one day deprive them of. Dear Arundel, I am inclined to think we are often &s;trangely de|ceived as to modes of felicity, and, while calcu|lating too nicely that we are to make for our&s;elves, we often overlook that Heaven has made for us."</P>
<P>"You would infer, then, that the enjoyment of an innocent plea&s;ure is more conducive to happine&s;s than the &s;atisfying a want? In this, at lea&s;t, our lively neighbours excel us. The in|ten&s;ene&s;s with which an Engli&s;hman applies him|&s;elf to the latter idea, damps his animal &s;pirits, and often brings on the &s;trange nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>rea&s;on|ing</HI> him&s;elf into gaiety."</P>
<P>"While the Frenchmen, <HI>an contraire,</HI> will be taught to rea&s;on him&s;elf out of it!"</P>
<P>"But Liberty&mdash;"cried Arundel, with enthu|&s;ia&s;m&mdash;</P>
<P>"Is a godde&s;s, I grant. But pr'ythee, dear Henry, lift thine eyes to one of the prettie&s;t mor|tal ru&s;tics that ever yet greeted them."</P>
<P>A blooming girl of about &s;ixteen, who &s;ud|denly
<PB N="23" REF="037796_0021_100F52CB5F351ED8">
appeared upon a winding path that cro&s;&s;ed the road, was indeed an intere&s;ting object. Yet <HI>intere&s;ting</HI> is not the word; for in truth, accord|ing to the modern acceptation of it, &s;he was no|thing le&s;s. But if among my readers there hap|pens to be a young man about the age of mr. Lind&s;ey, let him find a better. The little <HI>pay&s;anne</HI> was not tall; &s;o much on the embonpoint, as to approach the clum&s;ey; and tanned to a down|right brunette: yet would a painter, perhaps, have cho&s;en her for his &s;ubject. The ro&s;es on her cheek, deepened to unu&s;ual richne&s;s, gave to that very tan, which would have disfigured a colder complexion, the vivid glow poured over the land|&s;cape of a Claude. Large curls of auburn hair broke upon a brow of exqui&s;ite beauty, while the full-orbed eye beneath them &s;parkled in a bright fluid that &s;eemed created by youth, by hope, and health. A &s;hort jacket in the fa&s;hion of her coun|try, a &s;traw hat, and a ba&s;ket over-weighted with clu&s;ters of grapes, fini&s;hed the picture. To tho&s;e who recollect that a figure like this &s;tood the earne&s;t gaze of two young men, it may not be ami&s;s to add, that an hone&s;t Lubin attended her, who though tired from the vintage, and laden with &s;poil, &s;till went the longe&s;t way about, to follow the foot&s;teps of pretty Annette.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="037796_0022_100F52ACA057EC28">
"Mon&s;ieur peut bien pa&s;&s;er," &s;aid our dam&s;el, retreating, with a ru&s;tic court&s;ey, from the grand chemin, where Lind&s;ey, perceiving her about to cro&s;s it, had checked his hor&s;e.</P>
<P>"Will money, or charity," &s;aid he, aloud, in French, "obtain us &s;ome of tho&s;e beautiful grapes?"</P>
<P>The ears of the prety ru&s;tic were as quick as her eyes&mdash;hone&s;t Lubin, too, had the u&s;e of his: both were &s;olicitous to do the honours of their country; and our travellers, after the prodigious fatigue of riding three leagues, found it nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;t under the &s;hade, while the &s;ervants walked their hor&s;es to the neighbouring po&s;t. But this was a <HI>manoeuvre,</HI> which, though apparently &s;atis|factory to three of the company, was but little agreeable to the fourth: and the eyes of the young pea&s;ant ince&s;&s;antly reproached his mi&s;tre&s;s for tho&s;e glances which the per&s;on, the manners&mdash;and, above all, the flattery of Lind&s;ey, united to draw from her.</P>
<P>They &s;oon di&s;covered that Annettte could &s;ing. The vanity of her lover, even in de&s;pite of his jealou&s;y, betrayed, her. She had ju&s;t led the
<PB N="25" REF="037796_0023_100F52CFECA32790">
ru&s;tic chorus; nor was it difficult to prevail on her to repeat the air with which &s;he had charmed the vintagers. Our travellers thought them&s;elves in Arcadia.</P>
<P>"Ecoutez, Me&s;&s;ieurs," &s;aid Annette, inter|rupting their prai&s;es with a carele&s;s gaiety, "je m'en vais vous chanter un autre." And with a na&iuml;vet&eacute; that thought not of entreaty, &s;he &s;ung a wild and &s;imple air, where, as u&s;ual, <HI>l' amour</HI> was the chief &s;ubject, and of which &s;ome tender looks &s;he involuntarily be&s;towed on Lubin, proved <HI>him</HI> to be the object.</P>
<P>Lind&s;ey's good humour underwent a &s;udden change. "The girl is not &s;o pretty as &s;he ap|peared:" &s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to Arundel, as they walked through the town&mdash;"whereabouts did &s;he &s;ay &s;he lived?"</P>
<P>The contradiction of ideas, implied in the&s;e words, extorted from his friend an incredulous &s;mile; in which, however, there was no mix|ture of plea&s;ure or approbation. To &s;ay truth, he felt neither. The behaviour of Lind&s;ey within the la&s;t hour had been evidently marked with levity and &s;elf-love; levity that re&s;pected not in|nocence, and &s;elf-love that knew not how to
<PB N="26" REF="037796_0024_100F52AE33B79BD8">
brook either indifference or repul&s;e. But, if he had already been &s;urpri&s;ed, he found him&s;elf much more &s;o, when the &s;ame evening, in talking over their future <HI>route,</HI> mr. Lind&s;ey, without ap|pearing in the lea&s;t to con&s;ider his companions, &s;poke of remaining &s;ome days where he was, and then pur&s;uing a circuit that could not but detach him from theirs.</P>
<P>The &s;ecret in&s;olence that uncon&s;ciou&s;ly be|trayed it&s;elf in thus &s;uppo&s;ing his plea&s;ure a &s;uffi|cient argument for deranging the party, was felt equally by each, though differently received. Mr. Walbrook made a &s;ententious &s;peech; by which, it was plain, he meant nothing but to &s;hew his rhetoric and his complai&s;ance. Mr. Mortimer uttered a cold compliment; and Arundel replied but by a bow. They &s;oon after retired.</P>
<P>"Henry," &s;aid Mortimer to his young friend, as &s;oon as they found them&s;elves alone, "what makes you &s;o <HI>tri&s;te?</HI>"</P>
<P>"Only thoughtful, &s;ir."</P>
<P>"Come, come, be &s;incere! You are not plea&s;ed with Lind&s;ey."</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="037796_0025_100F52D2498754C0">
"I have at lea&s;t no right to be otherwi&s;e."</P>
<P>"Pardon me, my dear boy&mdash;the man who has a rea&s;on, has always a right. Shall I tell you frankly <HI>my</HI> opinion of him?"</P>
<P>"Certainly, &s;ir," &s;aid Arundel. "Yet his tongue and his countenance were a little at vari|ance. To &s;ay truth, though him&s;elf offended with Lind&s;ey, he &s;hrunk from a judgment which he felt would be &s;evere."</P>
<P>"Of all the young men I have ever &s;een," continued Mortimer, with more a&s;perity than the occa&s;ion &s;eemed to ju&s;tify, "Mr. Lind&s;ey is lea&s;t calculated to create e&s;teem. His heart is har|dened, and his mind enervated by indulgence. From his cradle he has heard nothing but adula|tion, and &s;een nothing but &s;ervility. He is in|deed affable, becau&s;e he is always obeyed; gene|rous, becau&s;e he is rich; &s;prightly, becau&s;e he i<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> young and flattered. Take away his youth his affluence, or his dependents, and you &s;hall find him &s;plenetic, marrow-minded, and arrogant."</P>
<P>"Heaven and earth!" cried Arundel, "what

a picture! From whence do you draw your con|clu&s;ions, &s;ir, and whither do they tend?"</P>
<P>The heart of Mortimer was full. The original of the portrait &s;tood before his mental eye; and Lind&s;ey was, in truth, but the mirror in which he &s;aw his father.</P>
<P>"Be &s;atisfied," &s;aid he, after a pau&s;e, "that my pencil is dipped in the colours of life: and &s;hould there even be deformity in the likene&s;s, let it at lea&s;t teach you, before you &s;anctify either your own caprices, or tho&s;e of others, with the name of friend&s;hip, to calculate how far the qua|lities on which that &s;hould be built are incidental, or natural."</P>
<P>Arundel &s;ighed; and willing, perhaps, to give a new turn to the conver&s;ation, uncon&s;ciou&s;ly ex|claimed, "If &s;uch is indeed the character of Lind&s;ey, how much is that father to be pitied, who&s;e blind fondne&s;s thus nouri&s;hes all that is corrupt in his offspring, and blights all that is worthy! while mine," continued he, &s;truck with the emotion of mr. Mortimer, which he attributed to a &s;udden impul&s;e of paternal regard, "mine&mdash;"though po&s;&s;ibly blu&s;hing for his &s;on&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="037796_0027_100F52D3D2C6B788">
"Dear child of my affections!" cried Morti|mer, embracing him, "&s;pare me this tender to|pic! Oh, Arundel, if I dared tell thee&mdash;If it was permitted me to reveal&mdash;But Hea|ven is my witne&s;s!" added he, with energy, "that there &s;hall come an hour in which I will do thee ju&s;tice!&mdash;When the grave &s;hall have cancelled&mdash;I mean when death&mdash;Let us wave further conver&s;ation!"</P>
<P>Arundel, confounded with all that had pa&s;&s;ed, obeyed in &s;ilence. Yet, as far as re&s;pected the character of Lind&s;ey, his heart was &s;till rebellious. Though not of an age, however, to abide by the &s;ugge&s;tions of experience, he was perfectly alive to tho&s;e of pride: nor was it till he came to &s;hake hands with his young friend the next day, that he repented the engagement he had made with Mortimer to continue their journey <HI>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te.</HI> Lind&s;ey was once more him&s;elf; wild, animated, enchanting.</P>
<P>"I have picked up a curio&s;ity this morning," &s;aid he: "an old German philo&s;opher, who has been explaining to me a new &s;y&s;tem of the earth. He was on the wing for Paris, with a portmanteau of recommendatory letters, and a waggon load of

mu&s;ty manu&s;cripts, be&s;ides minerals and fo&s;&s;ils innumerable, with which he expects to get a for|tune. I have per&s;uaded him to make one of my <HI>&s;uite.</HI> I &s;hall pick &s;omething out of him&mdash;and can indemnify my&s;elf at la&s;t," continued he, laughing, "for any extraordinary expence, by &s;hewing him in London as a &s;pecimen of the an|tediluvian race of mortals; for a more grote&s;que animal on two legs I never &s;aw."</P>
<P>The <HI>chai&s;e de po&s;te,</HI> which made its appearance at the door, put a &s;udden &s;top to this rattle.</P>
<P>"Whom have we here?" &s;aid Lind&s;ey.</P>
<P>"Tho&s;e whom you will not have long," re|turned Arundel, forcing a &s;mile.</P>
<P>"Why, what carries you off?"</P>
<P>"What keeps you here?"</P>
<P>The &s;ame an&s;wer, I pre&s;ume, will do for both," returned Lind&s;ey, with apparent di&s;&s;atisfaction, however: "our own inclination."&mdash;They &s;hook hands, and &s;eparated.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="037796_0029_100F52D75BED0858">
"Mr. Mortimer was in the right," thought Arundel, as he threw him&s;elf into the chai&s;e. "This young man has no idea of an independent being. He is offended becau&s;e, like the German philo&s;opher, we are not contented to become a part of his <HI>&s;uite.</HI>"</P>
<P>The days that intervened between this &s;epara|tion and their arrival at Lyons, were to mr. Mortimer more plea&s;ant than any that had pre|&s;ented them&s;elves for &s;ome weeks. The character of his pupil, as it opened before him, became more and more intere&s;ting. It had a &s;weetne&s;s, a &s;implicity, an affecting candour, particularly calculated to win the regard of one, who&s;e inter|cour&s;e with the world had produced him &s;o few in&s;tances of it. The tender deference with which the young man looked up to him, by flattering his &s;elf-love contributed to &s;trenghten his attachment. Arundel's affections were warmly alive; and cir|cum&s;tances allowed them &s;o few objects, that their energy, when indulged, was unu&s;ually pow|erful. Duty, as well as &s;en&s;ibility, directed them to mr. Mortimer; for he had never been able to per&s;uade him&s;elf, that the only being who ap|peared to take an intere&s;t in his fate, could be other than his father. To acknowledge his foi|bles,
<PB N="32" REF="037796_0030_100F531D4BCDE578">
as well as his virtues, it &s;hould be added, that he &s;ometimes indulged romantic ideas of vi&s;ionary grandeur; flattering him&s;elf that poli|tical concerns might have involved his family in ca&s;ual ob&s;curity, from whence they were again to ri&s;e to hereditary affluence and rank. To him, therefore, day after day pa&s;&s;ed &s;moothly on; while every &s;etting &s;un left the mental, as well as natural horizon, embelli&s;hed with a thou&s;and brilliant vapours, the ri&s;ing one renewed.</P>
<P>After voluntarily prolonging the journey &s;ome weeks, mr. Mortimer &s;aw him&s;elf e&s;tabli&s;hed in a hotel at Lyons; and taking from his <HI>vali&s;e</HI> a &s;mall packet of letters, informed his companion, that he intended to re&s;ide in the neighbourhood &s;ome time.</P>
<P>"The beautiful banks of the Rhone," &s;aid he, "pre&s;ent an endle&s;s &s;cope for admiration and en|quiry. Your education is hardly fini&s;hed enough to make you view the charms of Italy with a &s;cientific eye; and though I do not intend," added he, laughing, "to let you pick up an itinerant philo&s;opher who may in&s;truct you in a new theory of the earth, it may not be ami&s;s to be better in|formed of its productions, both natural and moral,

We will, therefore, ramble between this country and Swi&s;&s;erland, till our judgments are &s;ufficiently enlightened, and our imaginations elevated enough, to enjoy the &s;tupendous beauties that await us on the other &s;ide of the Alps. The&s;e letters it will be nece&s;&s;ary to deliver; and of one packet I &s;hall make you &s;ole bearer. It is addre&s;&s;ed to a lady who re&s;ides in a convent hard by, where &s;he will &s;oon, I believe, take the veil. Her family are extremely unfortunate, and have reque&s;ted me to offer her advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I am, however, ill qualified for the office, which yet &s;he may ex|pect me to undertake. I would wi&s;h her, there|fore, to &s;uppo&s;e I have cho&s;en a different <HI>route,</HI> that I may avoid bringing on my&s;elf claims which I cannot fulfil.</P>
<P>Arundel, for whom the &s;ound of a convent and a lady had already &s;ome charms, mo&s;t readily undertook the commi&s;&s;ion; though, having been but little in the habit of acting for him&s;elf, he felt &s;ome doubts as to the grace with which he &s;hould execute it. In this, however, he was un|ju&s;t to nature, who had hardly been more liberal to him internally, than externally. His counte|nance had not, indeed, that beautiful glow of youth and gaiety &s;o &s;triking in his brother's. His

per&s;on, though con&s;iderably taller, was le&s;s formed, his manners generally re&s;erved, and often even a little embarra&s;&s;ed: but the&s;e were the blemi&s;hes of habit and &s;ituation. Arundel's countenance, to much regular beauty, united an intelligence that &s;poke to the heart, and, where he was fami|liar, a vivacity that captivated the eye. The graces his form had not attained, it eminently promi&s;ed; and in his voice and manner there was a &s;hade, a colouring of mind, that was almo&s;t peculiar to him. He had, be&s;ides, an air of &s;en|&s;ibility to the merit of others, and a forgetfulne&s;s of him&s;elf, that was &s;ingularly charming to tho&s;e who had either undi&s;covered talents, or lively af|fections. But, alas! the greater part of the world po&s;&s;e&s;s not the&s;e, or bury them in &s;ociety; and, therefore, by the world at large he was little under&s;tood.</P>
<P>The lady he demanded at the convent he was readily admitted to; and he found her young, beautiful, and intere&s;ting: for how <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> a lady &s;een through a grate be otherwi&s;e?

<PB N="35" REF="037796_0033_100F52DCE42981E0">
fancied, a pair of very fine eyes: and to di&s;be|lieve a pair of fine eyes was hardly within the &s;tretch of Arundel's philo&s;ophy.&mdash;In &s;hort, why &s;hould we make a man a hero, where nature generally makes him a fool? In ten minutes he was as much in love as a young man can be who has never conver&s;ed before with a truly beautiful woman; and in ten minutes more as much in de&s;pair as a lover generally is who finds him&s;elf on the point of lo&s;ing his mi&s;tre&s;s: for, lo! on breaking the &s;eal of the envelope, our fair incognita di&s;covered that the letters were not intended for her, but for a &s;i&s;ter novice, who&s;e &s;anctified ap|pellation &s;omewhat re&s;embling her own, had given ri&s;e to the mi&s;take. Both parties now ex|pre&s;&s;ed a degree of confu&s;ion, which was increa&s;ed by con&s;cious regret, on perceiving that an ac|quaintance &s;o &s;uddenly made, mu&s;t almo&s;t as &s;ud|denly cea&s;e. The fair Loui&s;a at length broke &s;i|lence by an a&s;&s;urance, "that &s;i&s;ter There&s;a was too good-natured to &s;ee any thing in this error but a little heedle&s;&s;ne&s;s on the part of both, from which no harm could po&s;&s;ibly ari&s;e.

"Have <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> charity fir&s;t," cried Arundel, with unu&s;ual emotion, "to invent them for me."</P>

<P>With what de&s;ign this was &s;aid, or whether with any de&s;ign at all, cannot ea&s;ily be decided; but whatever was the motive, the effect of the &s;peech was a look from Arundel that made the eyes of Loui&s;a again &s;eek the ground, and re&s;tored that embarra&s;&s;ing &s;ilence from which they had been &s;o lately relieved,</P>

Je vais vous l'amener." And, &s;o &s;aying, with a girli&s;h gaiety that brought a brighter ro&s;e into her cheek, &s;he tripped away; and with her went the &s;en&s;es, the heart of Arun|del. Her &s;parkling eyes, her long fine hair which hung negligently down her back, the playful graces of her figure, and a certain character of countenance that blended the bewitching mode&s;ty of her own country, with the &s;prightline&s;s of that in which &s;he was educated, might, indeed, have touched a heart much le&s;s new to beauty than that of our young traveller.</P>
<P>The boa&s;ted charms of There&s;a he was not permitted to judge of, as &s;he wore the white veil of the novice, which fell over a complexion too pale to appear to advantage under it.

to Loui&s;a; and when on having fini&s;hed the peru&s;al, There&s;a threw up the veil to thank him, his eyes wandered over her features with &s;o apparent an ab&s;ence of mind, that the &s;hade, through negligence or pique, was again permitted to fall, and &s;he was contented no further to ob|trude her&s;elf on his attention, than by tho&s;e com|pliments politene&s;s would not allow her to di&s;pen&s;e with.</P>

<P>"What did you talk of?"</P>
<P>"Oh&mdash;a great many&mdash;a thou&s;and things!"</P>

<P>Arundel blu&s;hed, and bowed a&s;&s;ent. For the fir&s;t time in his life he had been but half &s;incere; yet why, he hardly knew. A trouble&s;ome glow that ru&s;hed from his heart to his cheek, an un|manly he&s;itation that &s;eized upon his tongue, and a confu&s;ed apprehen&s;ion of the interference of mr. Mortimer, fir&s;t involuntarily led him to conceal, what he afterwards knew not how to avow.</P>
<P>Time now pa&s;&s;ed not with Arundel as it had done. He loved with the ardour of a man who had never loved till then, and who &s;uppo&s;ed the
<PB N="40" REF="037796_0038_100F532813CF6558">
&s;entiment to be as much above that entertained by others, as he felt it to be to any he had him|&s;elf before experienced.</P>
<P>Was Loui&s;a &s;u&s;ceptible? Why, time mu&s;t di&s;|cover. She had, at lea&s;t, eyes for beauty, ears for admiration, and a happine&s;s of invention that furni&s;hed her perpetual excu&s;es for being in the way of both. There&s;a, unde&s;ired by either party, yet often the often&s;ible object of the vi&s;it, formed, generally, the third at the grate. To There&s;a, therefore, the hopes, the fears, and all the energy of Arundel's character, became intimately known. Of hers, he knew little. Ill health and ill fortune depre&s;&s;ed, timidity concealed it. Humility, com|placency, and &s;adne&s;s were all the <HI>traits</HI> by which he ever recognized her.</P>
<P>It was now, however, that our young traveller began to &s;peculate &s;eriou&s;ly upon life; and the fir&s;t ideas that occurred were relative to his own &s;ituation there. Had he any claims in &s;ociety? Was he the object of beneficence to mr. Morti|mer, or that of natural tenderne&s;s? What were his pro&s;pects, and where was to be his future e&s;ta|bli&s;hment? Painful que&s;tions, which the youthful heart never a&s;ks it&s;elf, till it has breathed that
<PB N="41" REF="037796_0039_100F52E3EB68ABC0">
&s;ickening &s;igh which is drawn from it by the heavy atmo&s;phere of the world!</P>
<P>Shrinking from an enquiry, of which he now, for the fir&s;t time, dreaded the con&s;equences, Arundel pa&s;&s;ed whole days, whenever he could do it without ob&s;ervation, in &s;olitary rambles. He drew exqui&s;itely; and as his liberality and &s;weetne&s;s of character &s;oon made him known to every cottage in the neighbourhood, he took plea|&s;ure in introducing, amid his &s;ketches, the little cherub faces that curio&s;ity or playfulne&s;s attracted round him.</P>
<P>It was on a lovely &s;ummer evening, when the rays of the retiring &s;un &s;till glowed on the river, and threw it forward, a bright mirror amid the land&s;cape,
<Q><L>While woods, and winds, and waves di&s;pos'd</L>
<L>A lover to complain,</L></Q>
that he was &s;lowly returning to the city, when his attention was engaged for a moment by a car|riage. It was only a moment; for hardly was that pa&s;&s;ed, ere one of the two travellers it con|tained was in his arms.</P>
<P>"Dear Arundel!"</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="037796_0040_100F532B3447AEA8">
"Dear Lind&s;ey!" exclaimed they at once inco|herently; "are we &s;o lucky as once more to meet!"</P>
<P>"Aye; and we will be &s;o wi&s;e as not ea&s;ily to part again," cried the ever impetuous Lind&s;ey. "In the interim, dear friend, pr'ythee make a &s;peech to my old Mentor, who &s;its there," con|tinued he, pointing to the vehicle, "as &s;ullen as Bajazet in his cage. In truth, we have quarrelled wor&s;e than Turks &s;ince I &s;aw you. However, having once carried my point of dragging him af|ter you, I leave all the &s;ubordinate articles of our amne&s;ty to be regulated as he plea&s;es."</P>
<P>Arundel who conceived no motive for di&s;gu&s;t or ill-humour in mr. Walbrook towards him&s;elf, immediately complied with the reque&s;t of his friend; but met with &s;o ungracious a reception, as little di&s;po&s;ed him to any further exertions of complai&s;ance.</P>
<P>"And now that we are once more met," &s;aid he to his friend, as they followed the carriage on foot into the city, pray tell me why we parted?"</P>
<P>"Why, thou traitor to thy country," &s;aid
<PB N="43" REF="037796_0041_100F52E5721B0AA8">
Lind&s;ey, laughing, "can&s;t thou find an Engli&s;h law that obliges a man to impeach him&s;elf? However, if it mu&s;t be &s;o, in two words, we parted becau&s;e I was capricious and arrogant."</P>
<P>"And we meet again&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Nay, <HI>there,</HI> dear Arundel, I can give a better account of my&s;elf: becau&s;e I have met none like you <HI>&s;ince</HI> we parted:&mdash;becau&s;e, though my head was wrong, my heart was right:&mdash;in &s;hort, for fifty other rea&s;ons unnece&s;&s;ary to detail."</P>
<P>"And how long is it &s;ince you left B&mdash;?"</P>
<P>"Three days."</P>
<P>"Three days!&mdash;Impo&s;&s;ible. Why, it is a week's journey."</P>
<P>"For a philo&s;opher, I grant you. But I was in pur&s;uit of a friend; which all your philo&s;ophers agree they have had nothing to do with. So, as the day was not long enough, I took the liberty of borrowing the night."</P>
<P>"And of obliging mr. Walbrook to borrow
<PB N="44" REF="037796_0042_100F532CC207D620">
it too! Upon my word, I cannot wonder that he had no &s;uperfluous complai&s;ance to be&s;tow, after you had taxed it &s;o highly."</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation now grew more intere&s;ting; and in the cour&s;e of twenty minutes the two young men had di&s;cu&s;&s;ed almo&s;t every topic that could touch the heart of either. Their &s;hort &s;e|paration had made them mutually feel the want of a companion and an intimate. They met, therefore, with that impa&s;&s;ioned intere&s;t &s;uch a conviction in&s;pires, and with the lively &s;low of animal &s;pirits every &s;entiment of plea&s;ure creates in a youthful mind.</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t &s;hew me this Loui&s;a to-morrow," &s;aid Lind&s;ey, in a low voice, as they parted; "I would &s;ain &s;ee the woman who can turn <HI>your</HI> head." There was an empha&s;is in the &s;peech that Arundel might have ob&s;erved; but ob&s;erva|tion, except on the eyes of his mi&s;tre&s;s, had not of late been his <HI>forte,</HI> and the inference pa&s;&s;ed un|noticed.</P>
<P>"Loui&s;a tells me,"&mdash;&s;aid he, &s;tarting one evening from a long <HI>reverie</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="037796_0043_100F52E7B555AFC0">
"And who, pray, is Loui&s;a?" &s;aid Mortimer, &s;tarting in turn.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion was &s;udden, was mal-a-propos; and neither willing, or, to &s;ay truth, quite able to an&s;wer it, he &s;tammered out with much perplex|ity, that &s;he was "the friend of There&s;a."</P>
<P>"The friend of There&s;a!" again re-echoed Mortimer with a tone of &s;urpri&s;e and incredulity, "and pray what friend has &s;he?&mdash;that is, where did &s;he find&mdash;I mean, in &s;hort, how came you acquainted with any friend of There&s;a's?"</P>
<P>The manners of Arundel, we have before &s;aid, were re&s;erved, but his character was impa&s;&s;ioned to a fault; and to dive beyond the &s;urface was to call forth all its vigour. With the &s;pirit of a man, therefore, and the eloquence of a lover, he now at full length recited the &s;tory of his heart. That of his auditor was vi&s;ibly moved with the narra|tive. "Imprudent boy," &s;aid he, &s;ighing when it was concluded, "I have then vainly &s;trove to &s;ave you from the contagion of vice!&mdash;You are, doubtle&s;s, ignorant," he added, with a tone of unu&s;ual a&s;perity, "that the father of this girl,
<PB N="46" REF="037796_0044_100F53336485BB40">
who&s;e name I now well recollect, is a needy ad|venturer&mdash;a profligate, di&s;graced in his own coun|try, and di&s;gracing it in others&mdash;a being &s;o low&mdash;"</P>
<P>"No, &s;ir," interrupted Arundel, in a &s;tifled tone of &s;en&s;ibility and pride, "I am <HI>not</HI> ignorant of the di&s;graceful connection&mdash;I have even thought of it with grief; and, when I can per|&s;uade my&s;elf that virtue and vice are hereditary, I &s;hall doubtle&s;s think of it with &s;hame. Till then, allow me to &s;ay, that, however an early and un|guarded attachment may impeach the <HI>head,</HI> tho&s;e who check it are not always aware of the dangers to which they expo&s;e the heart; nor do they con|&s;ider that by teaching us thus early to weigh pru|dence again&s;t nature, they po&s;&s;ibly &s;ub&s;titute the cold and frivolous errors of &s;elf-love, for the more generous ones of pa&s;&s;ion." Blu&s;hing, as he &s;poke, with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of offended, and offending feeling, he ha&s;tily withdrew. Yet the temperate &s;ilence of Mortimer was not lo&s;t upon him. "What am I to think of it?" &s;aid he, as he attempted to re&s;t. "He is indignant at my pe|tulance, or he relies upon my prudence: either way there is but one re&s;olution to take, and, painful as that may prove, it &s;hall be adopted."</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="037796_0045_100F52EA07EB7F10">
Youth always &s;leeps well upon a re&s;olution. The re&s;olution, it is true, often evaporates with the &s;lumber, and leaves nothing for the morning but the &s;elf applau&s;e of having formed it. Hap|pily Arundel's outlived the night; and it was at breakfa&s;t the next day that he communicated to mr. Mortimer his intention of pur&s;uing their pro|mi&s;ed tour into Switzerland, and of conquering, if po&s;&s;ible, by temporary ab&s;ence, a pa&s;&s;ion he ought not to gratify.</P>
<P>Was Arundel &s;incere?&mdash;No matter: at lea&s;t he thought he was. But the heart of a lover has &s;ometimes a <HI>fine&s;&s;e</HI> that deceives even him&s;elf; nor is it impo&s;&s;ible that a rigid examination of his own would have convinced our young philo&s;opher, that he had more lurking gratification in the idea of proving his pa&s;&s;ion unconquerable, than any real intention of conquering it. To Switzerland they went. But were the bold, the romantic, the intere&s;ting &s;cenes that country afforded, cal|culated to chill a &s;en&s;ibility to which every object was congenial? In vain did Mortimer read lec|tures upon botany: the letters of Loui&s;a were to his pupil a more intere&s;ting &s;tudy than all the Alpine curio&s;ities which a young and ingenious Italian had &s;pent years in collecting.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="037796_0046_100F533125345678">
"The&s;e in&s;en&s;ibles," cried he, as he rambled from them amid&s;t immen&s;e mountains, who&s;e white bo&s;oms were tinged with the beams of the &s;etting &s;un, and diver&s;ified with hanging cottages "the&s;e in&s;en&s;ibles pretend to admire the fibres of a leaf, yet to tho&s;e more tender and living ones within our brea&s;ts are they &s;toics. Great and &s;upreme Creator!" would he add, lifting his eyes towards heaven, ha&s;t thou drawn this bright ca|nopy over our heads? Ha&s;t thou enriched the earth on which we tread with numberle&s;s and ever-varying beauties? Ha&s;t thou ordained them through the medium of the &s;en&s;es to &s;teal upon the heart, and waken there a tremulous &s;en&s;ibility that rea&s;on is to cru&s;h?&mdash;Ah, no!&mdash;Choice, pa&s;|&s;ion, character, are thy gifts?&mdash;While Nature and her God are before him, man feels the influence of both: plunged in the vortex of cities, he becomes an artificial being, vulnerable no longer through any &s;en&s;e but intere&s;t or vanity?"</P>
<P>Whil&s;t his heart glowed with &s;imilar &s;enti|ments, did he often return to Mortimer: but alas! the glow was only in his heart; his com|plexion had lo&s;t it. Marlini, the young Italian, noticed the change; and, as he valued him&s;elf upon &s;ome knowledge of medicine (which was
<PB N="49" REF="037796_0047_100F52ED0213AD60">
the more generous of him, as he was never valued for it by any body be&s;ides), he would have pre|&s;cribed: but the complai&s;ance of Arundel ex|tended only to li&s;tening; and as Mortimer well knew that the complaint might defy a college of phy&s;icians, he was not very earne&s;t in enforcing their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>The heart of the young man, however, was yet to &s;truggle with a grief more oppre&s;&s;ive than that of love. Loui&s;a, who during the fir&s;t month of his ab&s;ence, had punctually attended to her pro|mi&s;e of writing now &s;ometimes neglected, and at others coldly fulfilled it: and Mortimer, who clo&s;ely watched the effect of his pupil's feelings, at length thought he &s;aw the luckle&s;s moment ar|rive, when it was nece&s;&s;ary to yield to a pa&s;&s;ion, that could no longer, without danger be con|trolled.</P>
<P>"Henry," &s;aid he, you have bla&s;ted <HI>my</HI> hopes; but I will not de&s;troy yours; the power I po&s;|&s;e&s;s of regulating your fate, I now confide to your&s;elf. Return to Lyons, offer to Loui&s;a a moderate fortune, and a heart dear to me as that within my own bo&s;om: let her e&s;timate the gift as it de&s;erves, and both may yet be happy."</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="037796_0048_100F5334EB005CA0">
Arundel, &s;carcely able to believe his &s;en&s;es while they conveyed to him a language &s;o de|lightful, falls, as it &s;hould &s;eem, motionle&s;s at the feet of his benefactor:&mdash;Not at all, however: he ri&s;es in a moment&mdash;he flies to the po&s;t-hou&s;e&mdash;he is no longer a con&s;umptive and enfeebled young man, who has neither eyes nor ears for any thing that pa&s;&s;es: on the contrary, he appears to think that he has borrowed the &s;en&s;es of all around him, by the ardour and frequency with which he reite|rates his orders. In fine, they are once more at Lyons, and forgetful of Lind&s;ey, or his <HI>&s;uite,</HI> whom they had left there&mdash;forgetful of Mortimer, who was &s;atigued&mdash;or of Marlini, who was a &s;tranger&mdash;he flies to the grate where he had &s;o often beheld Loui&s;a, and, with all the eagerne&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion, acquaints her that propo&s;als were on the point of being made to her father. What was the exce&s;s of his di&s;appointment, when, after li&s;tening to him in &s;ilence, Loui&s;a threw her&s;elf back in her chair and bur&s;t into a flood of tears! The countenance of Arundel, vivid but a moment before with hope and plea&s;ure, changed in&s;tantly to deadly palene&s;s.</P>
<P>"Loui&s;a! deare&s;t Loui&s;a!" cried he, throwing him&s;elf on his knees before her, "To what am I
<PB N="51" REF="037796_0049_100F52EE89C18F00">
to impute this emotion? You alarm, you &s;hock me! Can it be po&s;&s;ible that I am unfortunate e|nough to have lo&s;t my intere&s;t in your heart?"</P>
<P>"I will not deceive you, mr. Arundel," &s;aid Loui&s;a, &s;obbing, and covered with blu&s;hes; "you de&s;erve my candour&mdash;and&mdash;I will frankly ac|knowledge&mdash;" She he&s;itated; but the imperfect &s;entence was conviction&mdash;Arundel &s;tarted from his knees, &s;hocked at the abruptne&s;s, and overwhelmed with the di&s;appointment, of &s;uch an event.</P>
<P>"I thank you, madam," &s;aid he, after a pau&s;e, and in a voice hardly articulate; "I think I <HI>have</HI> de&s;erved your candour; though to bear it&mdash;" Again he &s;topped&mdash;turned from her, to her; and gazing for a moment on the loveline&s;s of a coun|tenance even tears did not disfigure, reproachfully added, "Oh Loui&s;a!"</P>
<P>"Do not believe," &s;aid &s;he, &s;tretching out her hand to meet his, as it gra&s;ped the grate, again&s;t which he leant&mdash;"do not believe that an un|worthy object has &s;upplanted you in my regard&mdash;I am &s;ure, when I have explained all, you will excu&s;e, will pity me!"</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="037796_0050_100F53372C715D78">
Arundel looked earne&s;tly at her&mdash;She had not then lo&s;t the pa&s;&s;ion, but changed the object&mdash;a new &s;entiment glanced faintly acro&s;s his mind&mdash;it felt, for a moment, like contempt; but love ar|re&s;ted the intruder, and changed its nature into jealou&s;y. "If to have adored you with a pa&s;&s;ion too powerful both for my happine&s;s and health," replied he, with a heavy &s;igh, "could have &s;e|cured me your regard, I &s;hould not now have the grief to know I have lo&s;t it. May he on whom it is be&s;towed have more &s;ucce&s;sful claims!&mdash;But you are pale!&mdash;This happy, this envied being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es not the power of making happy! Or is the felicity you would have enjoyed embittered by regreat for that you were about to deprive me of?"</P>
<P>"Yes, doubtle&s;s," &s;aid Loui&s;a, with an air of melancholy and confu&s;ion, "we have both felt for you."</P>
<P>"<HI>Both!</HI> repeated Arundel, trembling with a new and vague apprehen&s;ion, "How&mdash;how am to under&s;tand you?"</P>
<P>"Alas! I dare not explain my&s;elf!"</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="037796_0051_100F52F047399C00">
"Loui&s;a, I adjure you by every thing &s;acred, to tell me the name of him for whom I am thus cruelly renounced."</P>
<P>Loui&s;a blu&s;hed, wept, and was &s;ilent.</P>
<P>"Is it," continued he, he&s;itating, and &s;haking with uncontrollable emotion&mdash;" Is it not&mdash;<HI>Lind|&s;ey?"</HI> The countenance of Loui&s;a made reply unnece&s;&s;ary, while that of Arundel, true to his heart, &s;parkled with indignation. The generous diffidence of his nature, however, pre&s;ently pre|vailed. She avowedly loved another:&mdash;tenderly&mdash;fondly loved him; and that other was, in the eyes even of his rival, the mo&s;t winning of hu|man beings&mdash;endued with beauty, youth, wit, and accompli&s;hments enough, unintentionally to win the colde&s;t heart; and Loui&s;a!&mdash;ah! could he wonder that &s;he was irre&s;i&s;tible?</P>
<P>By &s;hort and imperfect explanations, he learnt that mr. Lind&s;ey had, from the moment he was &s;een by her, left an impre&s;&s;ion on her memory, ab&s;ence did not efface: during that of Arundel, he had vi&s;ited her once or twice through mere complai&s;ance: that an intere&s;t in&s;en&s;ibly &s;prung up between them: that his attendance became
<PB N="54" REF="037796_0052_100F5338BB791900">
more frequent: that love in fine lent his lan|guage to their eyes, and placed his interpreter in their hearts.</P>
<P>"It is enough!" &s;aid Arundel, &s;tarting from a train of thought this avowal occa&s;ioned. "I cannot <HI>be</HI> your happine&s;s, deare&s;t Loui&s;a&mdash;but I will at lea&s;t endeavour to e&s;tabli&s;h it." With the&s;e words he flew to her father, who had ju&s;t received a letter from Mortimer, explained to him his &s;ituation, and as ha&s;tily went in &s;earch of Lind&s;ey. A generous and delicate mi&s;tru&s;t of him&s;elf, made him precipitate mea&s;ures from which he feared he might recede: for Arundel was yet to learn all the value and noblene&s;s of his own heart.</P>
<P>Lind&s;ey received him with open arms; and his friend even thought he perceived the tran&s;|ports of &s;ucce&s;sful pa&s;&s;ion embelli&s;h his complex|ion, and lend animation to his eyes. What then was his a&s;toni&s;hment to &s;ee this envied lover plunged by his narration into a deep and cold re|verie!</P>
<P>"It is certain," &s;aid he, at length breaking &s;i|lence, "that I love Loui&s;a; &s;he has there &s;imply
<PB N="55" REF="037796_0053_100F52F34B02C190">
&s;tated a truth, which for your &s;ake I would wil|lingly have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed: but as to marrying her, <HI>that</HI> is wholly out of the que&s;tion at pre&s;ent; nor am I indeed &s;ure I &s;hall ever find it one at all." A tor|rent of new and indignant emotions again &s;welled the heart of Arundel; nor was it till his friend had given him the mo&s;t unequivocal proofs un|der his hand that Loui&s;a's pa&s;&s;ion had kept pace with, if not preceded the acknowledgment of his own, that harmony was re&s;tored between them.</P>
<P>Obliged &s;lowly to re&s;ign the illu&s;ive image of perfection he &s;o long had cheri&s;hed, Arundel &s;till thought &s;omewhat due both to that and him&s;elf. By arguments, therefore, and remon&s;trances, he wrung from his frieud a &s;olemn promi&s;e to &s;ee Loui&s;a no more, till ab&s;ence, by trying the cau&s;e between his tenderne&s;s and his pride, might ren|der his intentions le&s;s dubious.</P>
<P>"Loui&s;a," &s;aid Arundel, "is indi&s;creet; but you a&s;&s;ure me &s;he is virtuous: the pain of &s;eeing her otherwi&s;e would be more than I could pati|ently endure. Self-intere&s;t, therefore, bids me &s;tep forth the guardian of her innocence. If <HI>you</HI> love her enough to make a &s;acrifice, I will prove to you that I love her enough to rejoice in it.
<PB N="56" REF="037796_0054_100F533BB1822220">
But beware that you do not demand any from her."</P>
<P>Lind&s;ey laughed at his refinements, and, after much expo&s;tulation, agreed to prove his &s;incerity by taking a temporary leave of Lyons on the &s;ame day; a compliance in which he had, indeed, no great merit; as he had already more than half promi&s;ed a party of his countrymen to join them in a rambling excur&s;ion to Ni&s;mes.</P>
<P>Sad, &s;olitary, hopele&s;s, Arundel now bent his &s;teps towards home. The bu&s;ine&s;s of the day was accompli&s;hed. Of the day!&mdash;Ah! rather that of his life; for what remained of it &s;eemed nothing but vacuity and gloom: and he looked round in vain for &s;ome farther &s;acrifice on which to &s;pend the feveri&s;h enthu&s;ia&s;m of an overheated mind. Mortimer with concern perceived it glow on his cheek, and give an alarming expre&s;&s;ion to his eyes. Lind&s;ey, gay, in&s;olent, and happy&mdash;Lind&s;ey tri|umphant alike in fortune and in love over his more de&s;erving brother, became an object of ab|&s;olute dete&s;tation to the guardian of Arundel. The &s;ecret &s;o long concealed now trembled on his lips: his young friend even perceived that it did, and urged, with tender vehemence, to know what
<PB N="57" REF="037796_0055_100F52F4D37118B8">
further hope in life remained for him. The eter|nal argument, that he &s;hould always find time enough to do the ju&s;tice he de&s;ired, again &s;ilenced Mortimer. That &s;ecret and invi&s;ible Power, which &s;o often hovers over mortality, and with his icy breath annihilates its projects, unfelt, un|thought of, neverthele&s;s, even then approached him! The important truth, the deliberating mo|ment, were yet within his reach; but the truth was once more &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and the moment pa&s;&s;ed away no time was ever to re&s;tore!</P>
<P>"I will con&s;ider more of this, my dear boy," &s;aid he, as he mounted his hor&s;e to take an air|ing; "endeavour to compo&s;e your&s;elf for an hour, during my ab&s;ence, and my return &s;hall produce a &s;uitable explanation."</P>
<P>Mr. Mortimer was brought home three hours after, <HI>cold, &s;tiff,</HI> and <HI>bloody.</HI> A pi&s;tol bullet pa&s;&s;ing through his temple had perforated his brain; and in this condition he was &s;ound, by &s;ome pea&s;ants, not a hundred yards from the high road. His hor&s;e was grazing by his &s;ide. His pur&s;e which contained only a trifling &s;um, remained; but his pocket-book, where notes of value were probably enclo&s;ed, was not to be found.</P>

The &s;hock was too mighty, and Arundel's con&s;titution, already attacked, for the time &s;unk under it. Marlini, the young Italian, attended him with exemp<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">y kindne&s;s and humanity, through a burning fever; but ere he recovered to rea&s;on, the wi&s;hes, the intentions, and the er|rors of Mortimer had long &s;ince been buried with him in the grave. Hardly e&s;caped from thence him&s;elf, Arundel impatiently ha&s;tened to weep over that of his benefactor, and if po&s;&s;ible, to di&s;cover the perpetrators of his murder. Of them, however, no traces could be found. He was an ea&s;y mark for robbery, as it was his cu&s;tom to take gentle rides in the environs of the city at that hour when the retiring &s;un made the exerci&s;e mo&s;t plea&s;ant; and, when unaccompanied by Arundel, tho&s;e rides were well known to be &s;olitary. Ex|hau&s;ted by vain and painful &s;urmi&s;es on this cruel event, the latter at length began to examine the papers and property his protector had left behind him. But one inexplicable my&s;tery &s;eemed now to over&s;hadow the fate of Arundel. A few per|&s;onals of value, &s;ome Engli&s;h bank-notes, and letters of credit upon a hou&s;e at Genoa, were all that remained to trace his pa&s;t life, or to guide his future. Perplexed, bewildered, he pau&s;ed in &s;ilence over the gloomy pro&s;pect, when &s;ome &s;lips
<PB N="59" REF="037796_0057_100F52F7C7D1A5E0">
of paper, that were wedged within the hinge of a ca&s;ket, from whence the re&s;t appeared to have been ha&s;tily torn, attracted his attention. Cau|tiou&s;ly di&s;engaging one of them he &s;ound three lines, which ran thus: "To acknowledge, there|fore, another &s;on, nay even an heir, would be a &s;tep too injurious to my intere&s;t and honour to be thought of: I am determined <HI>never</HI> to do it; and Arundel mu&s;t be content&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Oh heaven and earth!" exclaimed the in|jured and unfortunate &s;on of lord Lind&s;ey, as he peru&s;ed the&s;e cruel words, from a hand which he could not doubt to be his father's; "<HI>Mu&s;t</HI> be content! Content without a tie! without a hope without one trace of tho&s;e to whom he owes his exi&s;tence, but in the unnatural &s;entence which cuts him off from them for ever!"</P>
<P>It was &s;ome moments before he could recover compo&s;ure enough to examine the remaining pa|per. Nay, he was almo&s;t tempted, by an emo|tion of indignant &s;en&s;ibility, to commit to the flames, unread, what, in the peru&s;al, was per|haps de&s;tined to inflict a &s;econd and more in&s;up|portable pang. The hand was evidently a female one; and the purport of the writing awakened a

feeling more lively, if po&s;&s;ible, than that excited before.</P>
<P>"Yet why &s;hould I blu&s;h to acknowledge what I do not blu&s;h to feel? In mr. Arundel are united every grace that wins affection, and every virtue that ju&s;tifies it. Born, I &s;incerely hope, for a more brilliant lot than that"&mdash;The tormenting paper here fini&s;hed: but &s;o did not his peru&s;al of it. Three times was it read; minutely was it &s;crutinized. Even that by which he had been a few moments before &s;o cruelly chagrined, &s;eemed to vani&s;h from his memory: while a &s;oft con&s;cious &s;lu&s;h of vanity and gratitude &s;tole imperceptibly over a cheek lately pallid with &s;ickne&s;s and &s;or|row.

<P>Nor was it till memory had dwelt with delight on many individuals of a gay and beautiful circle, with which his re&s;idence at Lyons had accu&s;tomed him to mingle, that he recollected the my&s;tery in which that being would probably remain ever enveloped.</P>

To the tran&s;ient gleam of plea&s;ure which for a moment had brightened his horizon, now &s;uc|ceeded long and cheerle&s;s months. Fruitle&s;s journeys to every place where mr. Mortimer had ever appeared to cheri&s;h intimacy, or demand credit, though by variety of &s;cenes, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of hopes, they re-e&s;tabli&s;hed his health, yet con|tributed to dimini&s;h his little fortune, without fixing his views. Of Loui&s;a he had taken a tender farewel previous to his leaving Lyons; and to Lind&s;ey he knew not how to addre&s;s him&s;elf, during an excur&s;ion, the plan of which was not &s;ettled even by tho&s;e who undertook it.</P>
<P>Bu&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">d in tracing the channels through which mr.

It was dated only ten days from that on which he had him&s;elf left Lyons, had followed him in his wanderings, and reached him at la&s;t by mere accident. The good-natured Italian who took a &s;incere intere&s;t in the happine&s;s of Arundel had engaged to write him any occurrence by which that might be af|fected.

<P>Arundel clo&s;ed the letter with a &s;igh. He had long cea&s;ed to e&s;teem Loui&s;a: even the impre&s;&s;ion &s;he had made upon his &s;en&s;es was con&s;iderably

<P>"I will try him, at lea&s;t," &s;aid Arundel, as he laid his hand upon the knocker of a magnificent hou&s;e in St. James's. We under&s;tand each other, and a moment will decide for us both." A mo|ment did decide: he was welcomed by Lind&s;ey, not indeed without embarra&s;&s;ment; but it was the embarra&s;&s;ment of a man who doubts his own re|ception, not that which he is to be&s;tow; wel|comed with lavi&s;h kindne&s;s, with generous cor|diality, with every te&s;timony of friend&s;hip that &s;en&s;ibility could offer, and graceful manners could

embelli&s;h. Arundel would have avoided &s;eeing lady Lind&s;ey, and for that rea&s;on excu&s;ed him&s;elf from re&s;iding under the &s;ame roof with her. But this was not to be thought of. The young lord, too happy both in love and fortune not to be a little vain, &s;aw, in the &s;ociety of Arundel, nothing but a new, and, as he deemed it, admi&s;&s;ible grati|fication to his &s;elf-love; and re&s;olutely, therefore, in&s;i&s;ted on not parting with him.</P>
<P>"Women, my dear friend," &s;aid he, "are among the baubles of life; we may each wi&s;h to appropriate, but we will never wrangle about them.

<P>"Nay, that is downright &s;lander," &s;aid Loui&s;a laughing. "Not ru&s;ty <HI>yet;</HI> though it may, per|haps, &s;ee veteran &s;ervice. He is an old adorer of mine&mdash;&s;o pray be civil to him!"</P>
<P>"With all my heart; provided <HI>you</HI> are not &s;o: but you had better make &s;ure of my complai&s;ance&mdash;a <HI>fortunate</HI> lover is never quarrel&s;ome, you know!"

If my reader happens to have white teeth, and one of the pret|tie&s;t mouths in the world, &s;he will find out the je&s;t: if not, it will probably defy her penetration, and may as well remain un&s;ought.</P>
<P>Lind&s;ey had judged truly: in le&s;s than a week, Arundel was completely cured of his partiality for Loui&s;a&mdash;a Loui&s;a far different from her he had fir&s;t &s;een at the convent. When he beheld her, cold of heart, and light of conduct, living only to di&s;&s;ipation and flattery; &s;carcely mingling with any of her own &s;ex, and admitting to her familiar &s;ociety the mo&s;t di&s;&s;olute part of his, often did he call to mind the caution Mortimer had once given him, of weighing, before he formed his attach|ments,
<PB N="66" REF="037796_0064_100F530355E06B08">
whether the qualities by which they were excited, are incidental or natural. Nor, though more &s;lowly developed, did the character of Lind|&s;ey ri&s;e in his e&s;timation. Warm in his profe&s;|&s;ions, and elegant in his manners, he &s;till attracted affection; but it was not po&s;&s;ible to overlook the profligacy of a life, every hour of which was marked by being abu&s;ed; and his friend perceived, with a &s;igh, how in&s;en&s;ibly, when not effaced by principle, the faint outline of youthful indi&s;cretion becomes filled up in our progre&s;s through life with the bold colouring of vice.</P>
<P>Amid the motley group who attended the levee of lord Lind&s;ey, Arundel was particularly at|tracted by an officer, who&s;e countenance, though &s;till in its bloom, bore the traces of di&s;appoint|ment. He was lately returned from a long &s;ta|tion in the We&s;t Indies; inclining to thin, but of a noble and graceful carriage; the climate had &s;omewhat impaired his complexion, and the &s;e|cret chagrin that &s;eemed to rob his eyes of their &s;ire, lent them a &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s calculated to excite intere&s;t. Tho&s;e of Arundel had at fir&s;t &s;tudi|ou&s;ly &s;ought their acquaintance; yet, &s;trange to tell, had &s;ought it in vain. Like an apparition, captain Villiers hovered amid the brilliant circle,
<PB N="67" REF="037796_0065_100F53114A6CEA30">
attentive, calm, and impenetrably cold to all but lord Lind&s;ey. As Arundel doubted not, how|ever, that he courted promotion, and gue&s;&s;ed by the crape round his arm that he had &s;u&s;tained &s;ome family lo&s;s, he adopted the cau&s;e, though not permitted judge of it, with an ardour that was natural to his character. But he was not long in di&s;covering, that Lind&s;ey's love of patronage ex|tended only to promi&s;es; and that, far from &s;oli|citing &s;ucce&s;sfully for others, he might perhaps do it vainly for him&s;elf. Yet, eager to emanci|pate his &s;ituation from that dependance to which it was every day approaching, he made the at|tempt, and was cruelly confirmed in his conjec|tures. Still never did refu&s;al wear &s;o fair a form: "My fortune and my hou&s;e, dear Arundel, are yours," &s;aid his friend; "when the one is impo|veri&s;hed, or the other di&s;agreeable to you, we will think of new plans."</P>
<P>Arundel was thus plunged again, de&s;pite of him&s;elf, into gay and di&s;&s;olute &s;ociety: he was young and charming; was it wonderful that he &s;hould be charmed; Ah! is there any illu&s;ion &s;o complete as that our own talents and graces &s;catter around us?

in heart, he imperceptibly drew nearer that pre|cipice of error, from which, no kind hand, either of nature or friend&s;hip, was extended to &s;ave him.&mdash;Yet &s;till had he both &s;en&s;ibility and pride&mdash;&s;till did he &s;pend many a &s;olitary hour in forming plans, by which the next might be more active&mdash;in &s;ighing over the memory of Mortimer, and in fruitle&s;s peru&s;als of the cruel, the inexplicable pa|pers he had left behind him. Lo&s;t in <HI>reverie,</HI> often did his thoughtful eye pierce through crowds for that unnatural father, who had thus announced his intention of never acknowledging him; often did his beating heart di&s;pel the illu&s;ion, which beauty diffu&s;ed over his &s;en&s;es, and anxiou&s;ly en|quire, where&mdash;where was the gentle being to whom his graces and his virtues were &s;o di&s;inte|re&s;tedly dear. For the paper which contained this avowal, from the moment that Loui&s;a had lo&s;t her place in his affections, he cheri&s;hed a roman|tic <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">nderne&s;s: the other, he had, on his arrival in England, communicated to Lind&s;ey; who &s;o far got the better of his u&s;ual inattention and heed|le&s;&s;ne&s;s, as to accompany him in per&s;on to the banker's, whence mr. Mortimer had obtained cre|dit at Paris. From him, however nothing could be learnt, but that five hundred pounds had been annually lodged there in that gentleman's name,
<PB N="69" REF="037796_0067_100F5304DC0F3A40">
the larger part of which had in the la&s;t year been drawn out, without &s;ince being replaced. Of this latter &s;um, a very &s;mall portion now re|mained to Arundel; and his indignant heart, rou&s;ed at the idea of pecuniary obligation, began to affect his temper: that mo&s;t cruel of all mala|dies, &s;elf-reproach, &s;eized upon it. To Lind&s;ey he &s;corned any other obligation than that of a&s;&s;i&s;t|ing him to &s;truggle for him&s;elf&mdash;an obligation which of all others Lind&s;ey was lea&s;t likely to con|fer: nor exi&s;ted there a being be&s;ides, from whom he could hope it. With a grieved and rankling heart, that veiled it&s;elf in &s;miles, was he going to the apartment of the latter, when he met cap|tain Villiers coming from it: both &s;eemed to have departed from their natural character; for Arundel, who&s;e thoughts were pre-occupied, and who was be&s;ides &s;omewhat di&s;gu&s;ted by the coldne&s;s with which his efforts at civility had been received, &s;carcely noticed Villiers, who, on his part, bru&s;hed by with a haughty rapidity that nearly amounted to rudene&s;s.</P>
<P>"Did you meet that &s;coundrel on the &s;tairs?" &s;aid Lind&s;ey abruptly as he entered the room.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="037796_0068_100F534A84785D08">
"If you mean Villiers, he pa&s;&s;ed me this mo|ment."</P>
<P>"'Twas well he did not affront you," &s;aid Lind&s;ey; "he was &s;ufficiently di&s;po&s;ed to have done it."</P>
<P>Arundel pau&s;ed for a moment, uncertain whe|ther to think he had done &s;o or no, and then re|&s;entfully added&mdash;"It <HI>was</HI> well, as you &s;ay, that he did not; for I was never le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to bear it"</P>
<P>"I would have you beware of him, however," &s;aid Lind&s;ey; "for as <HI>I</HI> cannot fight him," glancing fretfully at his arm, which a &s;train ob|liged him to wear in a &s;ling, "it is ten to one but he makes you do it."</P>
<P>"<HI>Me!</HI>" repeated Arundel, with a tone of a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>"Yes, <HI>you:</HI> &s;ince, if I may judge by his lan|guage, he <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">es you the honour of ranking you among&s;t my para&s;ites and dependants&mdash;I &s;hall find a future opportunity of talking with the gen|tleman."</P>

"The <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> will do for me," &s;aid Arundel warmly, and involuntarily advancing towards the door&mdash;"But what was the matter in di&s;pute?"</P>
<P>"Faith I hardly know&mdash;A&s;k <HI>him.</HI></P>
<P>"I am more than half tempted:&mdash;and if I do, I may probably convince him that I can take up the cau&s;e of a friend, without being either his dependant or para&s;ite."</P>
<P>"Dear Arundel," &s;aid Lind&s;ey, warmly &s;eiz|ing his hand, "how generous, how kind is this idea!&mdash;I cannot however admit it: it is true, we have both been in&s;ulted; but the cau&s;e is parti|cularly mine."</P>
<P>"If <HI>both</HI> have been in&s;ulted," &s;aid Arundel, "<HI>either</HI> is entitled to demand an explanation."</P>
<P>Lind&s;ey pau&s;ed on the idea; and his friend, who thought he perceived his a&s;&s;ent to it in his &s;ilence, felt his &s;pirit and his pride both con|cerned in not receding. The conver&s;ation that followed corroborating this opinion, he pre&s;ently di&s;patched a note to captain Villiers, reque&s;ting a few moments' conver&s;ation at any place he &s;hould
<PB N="72" REF="037796_0070_100F530A71C1F210">
name. This done, he left the apartment of lord Lind&s;ey, flattered with his applau&s;e, and gratified by his kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>But, though the temper of Arundel was thus inflamed, all felt not as it &s;hould have done in his heart. Per&s;onal courage was in him a con&s;ti|tutional gift, and it was that perhaps which le&s;t him more at lei&s;ure to a&s;k why he had thus drawn on him&s;elf the probability of a duel; but as on this head his own memory did not &s;upply him with any very &s;atisfactory an&s;wer, he deter|mined to refer to that of captain Villiers.</P>
<P>When two young men meet to know why they are to fight, it will be fortunate if &s;ufficient pro|vocation does not ari&s;e to render the enquiry needle&s;s: neither of tho&s;e in que&s;tien had any animo&s;ity, though no longer any per&s;onal prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, to each other; but truth mu&s;t be acknow|ledged. The high-&s;pirited Villiers did indeed look upon Arundel as one of the venal many who&s;e word and &s;word were equally at the com|mand of lord Lind&s;ey. Plunged in family cha|grins, and embittered by di&s;appointment, he had attended but little to nice di&s;criminations of cha|racter, and came prepared to con&s;ider the inter|view
<PB N="73" REF="037796_0071_1012181ACA068B28">
only as a paltry pretence for appropriating the quarrel: it was con&s;equently &s;hort. Arundel, proud, youthful, and brave, felt all his pa&s;&s;ions rai&s;ed by the cold indignity with which he &s;aw him&s;elf treated: the marked contempt with which Villiers mentioned the name of lord Lind&s;ey in|tere&s;ted his friend&s;hip: and when to that of Lou|i&s;a, as it accidentally aro&s;e, he returned a look and expre&s;&s;ion of mo&s;t ineffable di&s;dain; Arundel, who&s;e heart &s;till retained &s;ome embers of the &s;ire which once had made that name &s;o &s;acred, was no longer ma&s;ter of him&s;elf. It was the cau&s;e of gallantry, of honour, of friend&s;hip; and, fearful perhaps le&s;t reflection &s;hould di&s;cover to him that it was <HI>not</HI> the cau&s;e of rea&s;on, he the more readily embraced mr. Villiers's propo&s;al of meeting him, behind Montague-Hou&s;e, at five the next morning.</P>
<P>The hours that intervened were &s;pent in a fruit|le&s;s &s;earch after lord Lind&s;ey, who had early left the party with which he dined, and was not to be heard of. Di&s;appointed in the pur&s;uit, and im|mer&s;ed in a train of no very plea&s;ant reflections, Arundel &s;tood &s;urrounded by a gay and brilliant circle apparently li&s;tening to a concert, of which he heard nothing, when his eye ca&s;ually re&s;ted upon one of the band, who&s;e face in&s;tantly

brought to mind the recollection of Marlini&mdash;but Marlini &s;till in England&mdash;Marlini the botani&s;t turned fiddler, and that in an inferior rank&mdash;it was a thing impo&s;&s;ible!&mdash;Advancing clo&s;er, and leaning again&s;t the wain&s;cot, he amu&s;ed him&s;elf, till the conclu&s;ion of the &s;onata, with examining the features of his friend, till &s;atisfied of their identity, he approached the orche&s;tra and ad|dre&s;&s;ed him by name.</P>
<P>"Ah, mr. Arundel!" &s;aid Marlini&mdash;"how glad am I to &s;ee you, and how glad to find that you have not forgotten me!" Arundel mo&s;t cordially returned the &s;alutation, and expre&s;&s;ed his &s;urpri&s;e both at the place and the employment in which he found his friend engaged. "I have frequently," &s;aid he, "enquired of lord Lind&s;ey where I might find you: he a&s;&s;ured me that you were di&s;gu&s;ted with England, and had, he be|lieved, returned to Italy: that you had almo&s;t renounced botany; and I now recollect he even told me &s;omewhat of your having &s;hewn an ex|traordinary genius for mu&s;ic."</P>
<P>"So he was kind enough to tell <HI>me,</HI>" replied Marlini, &s;miling with &s;ome &s;corn; "and you &s;ee to what <HI>extraordinary preferment</HI> my genius has led

me. As to England, I have certainly no di&s;gu&s;t to it, though I have &s;ome cau&s;e to wi&s;h it did not &s;end its fools abroad to bring foreign fools home.&mdash;Another time, mr. Arundel, I will tell you more."</P>
<P>Arundel, who really felt intere&s;ted in the tale, and acro&s;s who&s;e mind it glanced that <HI>another time</HI> to him might never come, pre&s;&s;ed him to conti|nue the conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>"Nay, I have not much to tell neither," &s;aid Marlini, laying down his fiddle. "You know the repeated invitations which induced me to come to London; where I found <HI>il cavaliere</HI> Lind|&s;ey converted into <HI>la &s;ua excellenza,</HI> and &s;urrounded by a crowd of fools all gaping like my&s;elf for pa|tronage. To do him ju&s;tice, however, he re|ceived me very civilly, and recommended me to the care of his Swi&s;s valet, through who&s;e intere&s;t I got a lodging in the Seven Dials&mdash;not without a general invitation to dine at the hotel de Lind|&s;ey whenever it was agreeable to me. Alas! I did not then know that the latter clau&s;e was in fact a perfect exclu&s;ion. I made my way, how|ever, to his lord&s;hip's table, though not without bribing his porter with twice the money for which

I might have dined at the ordinary, and had the honour of taking my place at the bottom of it, between an old German and a young Engli&s;h di|vine. The company was numerous, and &s;ome of them talked as if they were men of &s;cience: I was therefore not without hopes, that his lord|&s;hip would take an opportunity of recommending my&s;elf and my &s;tudies to their notice. But in this I was di&s;appointed: they &s;at long, drank hard, and at length unwillingly broke up, to adjourn to the drawing-room, where lady Lind&s;ey had pre|pared a concert. I flattered my&s;elf, that in ge|neral conver&s;ation I might at lea&s;t be able to for|ward my own plans, and was greatly plea&s;ed by the civilities of an old gentleman, who&s;e con&s;e|quence was denoted by a &s;tar, and who talked to me in very good Italian.

<P>Arundel, to whom parts of this narrative had communicated &s;tings of which he who related it was wholly uncon&s;cious, was preparing to reply, when Marlini, being called upon to take his part in a full piece, had only time to give his addre&s;s; and the other, not unwillingly, re&s;igned his place to &s;ome ladies who pre&s;&s;ed near him.</P>
<P>One, two, three o'clock came, and lord Lind|&s;ey returned not. Arundel, who had &s;pent the night in walking his chamber, at length &s;aw day appear; and with a mixture of irre&s;olution, &s;elf-di&s;dain, and de&s;pair, ru&s;hed, with the friend who was to accompany him, to the place of appoint|ment.

incline Arundel to re&s;ign the care of him who&s;e murderer he now began to deem him&s;elf; and he re&s;olutely followed them into the carriage which was to convey mr. Villiers to an hotel not far di&s;tant. The danger was there declared by the &s;urgeons to be le&s;s imminent than it appeared. The &s;word had fortunately mi&s;&s;ed the vitals; and though by penetrating deeply it had cau&s;ed a va&s;t effu&s;ion of blood, the wound bore no pre&s;ent ap|pearance of being mortal. Arundel became more compo&s;ed at intelligence &s;o unexpected, and was at length prevailed upon to retire.</P>
<P>The events of the morning were now to be re|counted to Lind&s;ey; and to Lind&s;ey, &s;pite of his faults, the agitated &s;pirits of his friend &s;till turned with habitual confidence.

<P>"Or perhaps," added Lind&s;ey, "&s;he has been &s;o already!&mdash;But pr'ythee, dear Arundel, let me coun&s;el you as a friend not to make a practice of drawing your &s;word in <HI>that</HI> cau&s;e!"

<P>"The generous blood of Villiers is on my &s;word!" exclaimed he, ru&s;hing from a roof which he knew not to be his paternal one: "I will not wrong him &s;o far as to blend it with the unworthy tide that flows through the heart of lord Lind|&s;ey!"</P>
<P>His feet &s;pontaneou&s;ly moved to the hotel to which captain Villiers had been carried; but the recollection that repo&s;e and perfect quiet had been deemed e&s;&s;ential to his &s;afety forbade him to enter it. Lo&s;t in a tide of heart-wringing re|collections, he wandered, he knew not whither, through half the &s;treets of the metropolis, till the bu&s;y crowds with which they were filled retired at the approach of evening. Stragglers among the di&s;|&s;olute or the idle &s;till faced the nipping autumnal wind, which began to ri&s;e; and a &s;mall crowd of the&s;e, collected round a ballad-&s;inger, impeded, in a narrow &s;treet, the pa&s;&s;age of Arundel. The mo|mentary embarra&s;&s;ment awakened his &s;en&s;es, and a &s;ound that &s;truck from thence upon his memory induced him to &s;tart forward. It <HI>was</HI> to be a day of painful retro&s;pection. The female who
<PB N="83" REF="037796_0081_100F2907AFB6F740">
&s;ung had the appearance of a Savoyard: a little common organ hung at her &s;ide&mdash;her complexion was tanned&mdash;her figure was emaciated&mdash;her eyes were hollow&mdash;&s;traggling locks of auburn hair added rather a mi&s;ery than a charm to her appear|ance;&mdash;yet the foreign accent, the beautiful brow&mdash;above all, the well remembered air &s;he &s;ung, at once carried conviction to the heart of Arundel&mdash;It <HI>was</HI>&mdash;it <HI>could</HI> be no other than Annette! Annette betrayed!&mdash;Annette, the victim of Lind&s;ey! expo&s;ed in the fir&s;t in&s;tance to di&s;grace, and in the la&s;t to poverty! frail, yet not licen|tious! mi&s;erable, yet not vindictive! drew from the charity of &s;trangers that humble pittance which indu&s;try and innocence had rendered once &s;o honourable!&mdash;Let us draw a veil over the picture, and follow Arundel.</P>
<P>In &s;olitude, &s;ilence, and adver&s;ity, he now in|deed had learnt to think&mdash;to e&s;timate the differ|ence between real and imaginary ble&s;&s;ings&mdash;and to perceive how neglect, indi&s;cretion, and &s;elf-love, &s;catter, even from the bo&s;om of luxury, the fruitful &s;eeds of vice and deva&s;tation.</P>
<P>After various painful &s;elf-denials, he thought he might at length venture to reque&s;t admi&s;&s;ion
<PB N="84" REF="037796_0082_100F281BD52233B8">
to Villiers, of who&s;e wound he received the mo&s;t favourable reports; nor was it among the lea&s;t of his late mortifications to learn, that on the noon of that day, Villiers had by his own orders, been conveyed into a chair, and, after paying every expence, quitted the hotel without leaving behind him the &s;malle&s;t indication of the place of his retreat.</P>
<P>Arundel was now overwhelmned with chagrin and di&s;appointment. On the idea of offering an honourable and ample conce&s;&s;ion, his heart had re&s;ted with romantic enthu&s;ia&s;m. Perhaps he had &s;ecretly flattered him&s;elf he might find a friend in that generous antagoni&s;t with whom his feelings had at fir&s;t &s;ight claimed acquaintance.</P>
<P>Fru&s;trated in his pa&s;t views, and hopele&s;s of the future, his &s;pirits would have been wholly de|pre&s;&s;ed but for a &s;ingular event.</P>
<P>A note from the banker with whom mr. Mor|timer had tran&s;acted bu&s;ine&s;s, informed him, that two hundred pounds had been recently lodged in the hou&s;e, payable either to that gentleman's or|der or mr. Arundel's,</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="037796_0083_100F29095446DB60">
Soft hope again &s;tole over the heart of the lat|ter. He was not then forgotten!&mdash;Some being was &s;till intere&s;ted in his fate! Some protecting &s;pirit, like that of Mortimer, &s;till hovered over him!&mdash;Ah! could it be a female one?</P>
<P>Relieved from pecuniary embarra&s;&s;ments, it was his fir&s;t employment to di&s;cover the habitation of captain Villiers. The poor rarely have a &s;ecret that is well kept; and in a very few days it was traced to be the &s;econd floor of a hou&s;e in a &s;mall &s;treet near Piccadilly. Bounded as Arundel's means were, yet, to &s;hare them with the man he had injured, and who&s;e circum&s;tances, it was plain, could ill &s;upport extraordinary expence, be|came now the fir&s;t object of his life. To have &s;hared them, indeed, with tho&s;e he had <HI>him&s;elf</HI> injured, might have been only ju&s;tice; but to &s;ay truth, the improvident Arundel was hardly le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to &s;hew his liberality to Marlini and Annette.</P>
<P>Captain Villiers was now in a &s;tate to quit his chamber; and Arundel, who well knew how to calculate the wi&s;hes of pride, ea&s;ily concluded that he had no other mode of in&s;uring their meeting but a &s;urpri&s;e. Forbearing, therefore, his u&s;ual
<PB N="86" REF="037796_0084_100F281DC000BF68">
anonymous enquiry, he one evening repaired to the hou&s;e; where, being told by a &s;ervant that mr. Villiers was in his apartment, he abruptly walked up &s;tairs, and, without further ceremony than a gentle rap, opened the door. Candles in the room there were none; but the twilight, aided by the bright blaze of a &s;ire, enabled him clearly to di&s;cern Villiers, who repo&s;ed on a &s;opha on one &s;ide of it, while on the other &s;at a tall and fair young lady in mourning, who appeared to have been reading to him.</P>
<P>Generous minds are not long in under&s;tand|ing each other. Villiers was prepared, by &s;ome frank and noble <HI>traits</HI> that he had di&s;covered in the character of his vi&s;itor, to give him credit for qualities the other was now well di&s;po&s;ed to &s;hew. To remove prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, was to en&s;ure regard: Arundel was born to be beloved; and captain Villiers, though le&s;s fa&s;cinating, had a candour and martial enthu&s;ia&s;m of mind which circum&s;tances only had concealed. The conver|&s;ation &s;oon became unfettered and intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>"On the father of the pre&s;ent lord Lind&s;ey," &s;aid Villiers, "mine had claims of friend&s;hip to which the former was not in&s;en&s;ible: they induced
<PB N="87" REF="037796_0085_100F290BEFDB9A28">
him to be&s;tow on me, very early in life, a com|mi&s;&s;ion, which, though it brought with it many years of painful &s;ervice, in a climate injurious to my health, ought to be remembered with kindne&s;s. Attentive to me even during his la&s;t illne&s;s, by a letter addre&s;&s;ed to the &s;on who&s;e ingratitude and negligence avowedly &s;hortened his days, he re|peated his earne&s;t de&s;ire that I might be promoted in my profe&s;&s;ion, and relieved from various pe|cuniary embarra&s;&s;ments, in which the indi&s;cre|tions of my father had involved his family. By the young lord Lind&s;ey I was at fir&s;t treated with kindne&s;s and di&s;tinction. Reiterated promi&s;es taught me to hope every thing; but I hoped, only to be di&s;appointed. I knew enough of the world, however, to have &s;u&s;tained that like a man;&mdash;but when to neglect he dared to add injury&mdash;when he pre&s;umed to violate&mdash;in &s;hort&mdash;why &s;hould I di&s;|&s;emble? when he would have trafficked upon the &s;i&s;ter's honour for the brother's promotion, it was then I felt like a &s;oldier."</P>
<P>Arundel, who&s;e cheek glowed with indignation and remor&s;e, &s;tarted ha&s;tily from his &s;eat; which Villiers, with a &s;mile of kindne&s;s, motioned to him to re&s;ume.&mdash;"By an intercepted letter I became apprized of a &s;ecret which my &s;i&s;ter's &s;ears for
<PB N="88" REF="037796_0086_100F2820F5E7BE60">
my &s;afety had induced her to conceal. With what determination I afterwards &s;aw lord Lind&s;ey, I hardly know my&s;elf; but I well recollect, that re&s;pect for the memory of his father, and his own inability to &s;ight, alone prevented my pur|&s;uing tho&s;e violent mea&s;ures I was but too well inclined to, when the ill fortune of both induced you to reque&s;t an interview with me. I &s;aw you with prejudiced eyes: had I &s;een you with any other, our &s;words had never been drawn. Yet let me do you the ju&s;tice of acknowledging, that, even in the &s;hort conver&s;ation which preceded our appointment, I perceived I had an adver&s;ary to encounter, of who&s;e dignity of character I was little aware; and though unable to reduce either my re&s;entment or my pride to a tardy expla|nation, I met you with a reluctance, that per|haps contributed, with your own &s;kill, to give you the advantage you obtained."</P>
<P>Arundel, at once grieved and flattered, ce|mented the growing friend&s;hip by a confidence, not indeed minutely detailed, for the health of Villiers allowed not of long conver&s;ation, but unbounded as far as related to lord Lind&s;ey, and departed with an invitation to repeat his vi&s;it next day.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="037796_0087_100F290EC4230560">
The vi&s;it was repeated again&mdash;and again&mdash;and again. Mi&s;s Villiers was almo&s;t con&s;tantly with her brother, and as con&s;tantly pur&s;ued the me|thod &s;he had fir&s;t adopted, of retiring at the en|trance of his friend. Arundel could not avoid feeling &s;ome pique at the beautiful &s;tatue he had &s;o little power of animating: not that he allowed beauty to be any advantage&mdash;oh, no! "Loui&s;a had cured him! Loui&s;a had rendered him forever indifferent to &s;o illu&s;ive an attraction;" and he repeated this &s;o often that he really believed it. It was the mind&mdash;the vi&s;ible expre&s;&s;ion of it in the countenance of Henrietta with which he was now charmed. It was the &s;weet &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of her eyes&mdash;&s;o like her brother's, only heightened by the fine&s;t long la&s;hes in the world, that made an irre|&s;i&s;tible impre&s;&s;ion on his memory. Yet, never to &s;peak, never to permit him the common claims of an acquaintance eternally to curt&s;ey and withdraw it was &s;o &s;trange, &s;o cruel, &s;o &s;ingular an in&s;tance of coquetry, that really all the philo|&s;ophy he was ma&s;ter of could not &s;tand it.</P>
<P>Chance, however, did for him what mi&s;s Vil|liers would not do. After &s;pending the morning with her brother as u&s;ual <HI>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te,</HI> he had taken his leave, when, on walking the length of the
<PB N="90" REF="037796_0088_100F284DF79EB560">
&s;treet, &s;omewhat occurred that he had neglected to mention; and ha&s;tily returning, he threw open the door of the apartment, where Henrietta was then &s;itting alone. A con&s;cious&mdash;a half re|proachful &s;mile brightened the features of Arun|del, as he re&s;pectfully advanced and addre&s;&s;ed her. Mi&s;s Villiers, on the contrary, turned pale, blu&s;hed, and, dropping her eyes, <HI>faintly</HI> replied to his que&s;tions; but the voice was not to be mi&s;|taken&mdash;a voice &s;o touching, &s;o inimitably &s;oft&mdash;Heaven and earth! what was his a&s;toni&s;h|ment when it was immediately recognized to be that of There&s;a!&mdash;There&s;a,&mdash;the tender friend &s;o long and &s;o ungratefully forgotten.</P>
<P>If Arundel was tran&s;ported, far different were the feelings of mi&s;s Villiers.&mdash;Con&s;cious, aba&s;hed, devoid of all power of feigning&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> recol|lecting what &s;he <HI>ought</HI> to know, or what &s;he <HI>ought</HI> to tell; it was amid&s;t blu&s;hes, he&s;itation, and tremor, that he learnt &s;he was the daughter of Mortimer!&mdash;The daughter of Mortimer! Ah! he learnt not that only: there was a &s;u&s;picion, there was a truth remained behind, at which, though his heart beat with exultation and hope, he ventured not even remotely to glance. Yet who el&s;e &s;hould write to Mortimer that &s;he did
<PB N="91" REF="037796_0089_100F2910552986B8">
not blu&s;h to acknowledge an intere&s;t for him?&mdash;Who el&s;e &s;hould tell his guardian and his friend, "that he had every grace that wins affection, and every virtue that ju&s;tifies it?" Who but Hen|rietta had opportunity, whil&s;t he was in pur&s;uit of another object, to dwell unob&s;erved upon his character&mdash;to trace all its energies&mdash;to feel all its di&s;appointments&mdash;and uncon&s;ciou&s;ly to cheri&s;h a treacherous &s;entiment under the name of a gene|rous one?</P>
<P>Captain Villiers, who was only in the adjoining apartment, entered at this moment, and &s;aw with &s;urpri&s;e Arundel holding the hand of his &s;i&s;ter, and &s;peaking with an eagerne&s;s that marked the tendere&s;t intere&s;t in what he uttered.</P>
<P>"Dear Villiers!" &s;aid the latter, recovering him&s;elf to &s;pare her embarra&s;&s;ment, "Would you believe that I have found in your &s;i&s;ter an old and tenderly beloved friend?"</P>
<P>"So it appears," &s;aid Villiers &s;miling; "but how came you to take advantage of my ab&s;ence to make this di&s;covery?"</P>
<P>"Mr. Arundel," &s;aid Henrietta, &s;triving to
<PB N="92" REF="037796_0090_100F285054C57D58">
command her&s;elf, "had <HI>forgotten</HI> his friend, and I was not willing to obtrude her upon his me|mory."</P>
<P>Every truth but one was now avowed on all &s;ides; and Villiers was not &s;o dull of comprehen|&s;ion as to overlook that.</P>
<P>"The veil&mdash;the cruel veil," cried Arundel re|proachfully, as they recounted their interviews in the convent&mdash;</P>
<P>"&mdash;Was <HI>once</HI> at lea&s;t withdrawn," added Hen|rietta blu&s;hing;&mdash;"but the features it &s;haded were not worthy of retaining your eye."</P>
<P>Arundel, who too well recollected the circum|&s;tances of their fir&s;t meeting, could only an&s;wer by a look&mdash;a look that at once conveyed his own &s;elf-reproach. Yet time, that had matured his under&s;tanding, had al&s;o matured the beauty of Henrietta; who&s;e features, though ever regular, were far from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, while in the convent, that lovely fini&s;h her whole per&s;on had &s;ince at|tained.</P>
<P>The older mr. Villiers, obliged by his nece&s;&s;ities
<PB N="93" REF="037796_0091_100F2913438F7FC0">
to renounce his own name, had, under that of Mortimer, afforded the parental protection to Arundel which nature had de&s;igned for his own children. Of the&s;e children one had been com|mitted to the care of lord Lind&s;ey, who, by em|barking him early in a military line, deprived him of the opportunity to make trouble&s;ome enquiries. For his daughter, unprotected and dowerle&s;s, mr. Villiers's religion enabled him to allot a life of &s;e|clu&s;ion in the convent where &s;he had been edu|cated; nor was it till lord Lind&s;ey him&s;elf &s;tarted the propo&s;al of marrying Arundel abroad, that he thought of a &s;cheme by which all their views might be conciliated. With this &s;cheme, how|ever, Henrietta alone had ever been made ac|quainted; and though Arundel and her brother could not fail, in the cour&s;e of the explanation, to &s;urmi&s;e it, &s;he earne&s;tly guarded the idea from obtruding.</P>
<P>To captain Villiers, indeed, all this was new: his father's caution had kept from his knowledge the change of his name&mdash;the companion of his travels&mdash;in a word, every thing but what related to the embarra&s;&s;ment of their affairs, or the wel|fare of his &s;i&s;ter.

in the hou&s;e of the young lord Lind&s;ey, it was on the event of the duel that his name fir&s;t tran&s;pired to Henrietta. Why her previous acquaintance with it had been &s;o cautiou&s;ly omitted in all con|ver&s;ations with her brother relative to her father's vi&s;it at Lyons, neither gentleman pre&s;umed to a&s;k, probably for the be&s;t of all rea&s;ons&mdash;that both of them could gue&s;s.</P>
<P>The moment of final di&s;covery now &s;eemed dawning upon Arundel&mdash;but it was only a gleam. Of his birth, captain Villiers knew nothing; and Henrietta, to whom her father never confided more of his plans than was nece&s;&s;ary for their ac|compli&s;hment, only faintly recollected to have heard him once &s;ay that he was the &s;on of a mr. Arundel of Cornwall.</P>
<P>"It is &s;trange that my father &s;hould leave no papers by which to gue&s;s at this my&s;tery," &s;aid Villiers. The anxious eyes of his &s;i&s;ter half &s;ought tho&s;e of Arundel, and her cheek was flu&s;hed with apprehen&s;ion for his an&s;wer.</P>
<P>"Very &s;trange," replied the latter with a du|plicity love fir&s;t had taught him&mdash;"It was, I know, his cu&s;tom to burn all his letters after
<PB N="95" REF="037796_0093_100F2915676B9938">
reading them: the few lines that alone fell into my hands we will take an early opportunity of examining together."</P>
<P>Re-a&s;&s;ured by the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of his an&s;wer, Henrietta recovered her&s;elf. Her &s;ecret &s;afe&mdash;her lover and her brother thus perfectly united&mdash;could the world pre&s;ent a livelier plea&s;ure than that which glowed round her heart? The fire|&s;ide of Villiers was now embelli&s;hed with the &s;miles of happine&s;s, and a long, a lengthened evening &s;ucceeded, during which Arundel drank deep draughts of a pa&s;&s;ion which he attempted not to re&s;i&s;t; and which beauty, merit, cultivated under|&s;tanding, and poli&s;hed manners, united to ju&s;tify.</P>
<P>Strolling through the city the next morning with Villiers, a man who &s;eemed guarding the door of a narrow and dirty entry attempted to put a printed paper in his hand. It would have been rejected, had not the unexpected enforcement of "You had better take it, mr. Arundel," induced him to &s;top. He looked earne&s;tly at the figure by whom it was pre&s;ented, and, under an im|men&s;e bu&s;h of wig, a threadbare coat and a &s;car|let wai&s;tcoat laced with gold, di&s;covered his quondam acquaintance, the German philo&s;opher.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="037796_0094_100F28559E3C8638">
"You can't oblige an old friend with le&s;s than a &s;hilling, mr. Arundel," &s;aid the German, "&s;o pray have the goodne&s;s to walk in." Arundel complied; but he mu&s;t have been a philo&s;opher him&s;elf to forbear &s;miling when he perceived his friend's collection of minerals and fo&s;&s;ils con|verted into what be called a very pretty "<HI>rarce &s;how;</HI>" by which, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a few common philo&s;ophical experiments medical ad|vice offered gratis, and a &s;mall pretence at judi|cial a&s;trology, the German a&s;&s;ured him he gained a tolerable livelihood.</P>
<P>"Not," &s;aid he, "but I had better have &s;tu|died a &s;y&s;tem of the world than that of the earth, and then I &s;hould have been aware of &s;ome of its revolutions, which all my knowledge of the &s;tars even did not inform me of."</P>
<P>Arundel, who knew his acquaintance's head to be filled with as much real learning as might have &s;upplied half a univer&s;ity, could not but &s;mile at the &s;ingular &s;toici&s;m di&s;played in his conduct; and though he felt not that tender intere&s;t with which the quick &s;en&s;ibility and embittered &s;pi|rit of the Italian had in&s;pired him, yet was his &s;mile in&s;en&s;ibly cha&s;tened by a &s;igh, when he
<PB N="97" REF="037796_0095_100F2916F4DDA548">
contra&s;ted the <HI>character</HI> of the German and his fate.</P>
<P>"The romantic days of chivalry, and the de&s;|potic ones of &s;eudal authority, are both vani&s;hed," &s;aid he, as he commented with his friend on the events they had lately witne&s;&s;ed. "M<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">n, at that period, was contented to barter independency for protection, and found in the cheri&s;hing power of rank &s;omewhat that con&s;oled him for its &s;upe|riority. The gro&s;&s;er ligaments that then bound the great to the little have in&s;en&s;ibly refined into the nicer ones of benevolence, di&s;tinction, or pa|tronage. How careful ought the great to be that they &s;nap not the&s;e by &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, pride or ca|price!&mdash;How, in&s;tead of weakening, ought they to &s;trengthen, ties, by which the human &s;pecies is <HI>allured</HI> to that &s;ubordination to which no mortal effort can ever, perhaps, <HI>awe</HI> them!"</P>
<P>"You think deeply," returned his friend.</P>
<P>"No, dear Villiers, I only feel deeply&mdash;feel for the virtues I have &s;een betrayed&mdash;the talents I have &s;een blighted&mdash;the &s;en&s;ibilities," he added, half &s;mothering a &s;igh, "I have known rejected; and by a man to whom it would have co&s;t &s;o little to have cultivated all."</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="037796_0096_100F28F50C8A76E8">
The &s;ight of mi&s;s Villiers at once di&s;&s;ipated &s;pleen and philo&s;ophy. A thou&s;and more inte|re&s;ting topics occurred; and the &s;ubject of his birth engaged the attention both of Arundel and his friends. The paper he believed to have been written by his father was vainly examined by each.</P>
<P>"The clue my &s;i&s;ter has given us," &s;aid cap|tain Villiers, "&s;eems, after all, the only po&s;&s;ible one to lead to a di&s;covery. You mu&s;t go into Cornwall, and the &s;ooner the better; for we are none of us rich enough to &s;pend either money or time in unnece&s;&s;ary delays. Suppo&s;e you &s;et off to-morrow!"</P>
<P>"To-morrow is &s;urely too &s;oon!" an&s;wered Arundel, intuitively fixing his eyes on mi&s;s Villiers.</P>
<P>"I think not," &s;aid her brother &s;miling; "ra|ther remember, dear Arundel,
<Q><L>To-morrow is too late:</L>
<L>The <HI>wi&s;e</HI> lived ye&s;terday!"</L></Q></P>
<P>"Ah!" cried Arundel warmly, "it was in|deed only ye&s;terday that I began to live! How|ever, I will go to-morrow, if you think it advi&s;a|ble.
<PB N="99" REF="037796_0097_100F2925269355F0">
A family of con&s;equence enough to mention an <HI>heir</HI> cannot be unknown in the country; and I may at lea&s;t find ground for conjecture, whe|ther I am able to make the wi&s;hed-for di&s;covery or not."</P>
<P>"I have good pre&s;entiments," &s;aid Villiers as he quitted the room to attend a trouble&s;ome vi&s;itor in the next&mdash;"though certainly that nothing &s;hould even accidentally remain but tho&s;e lines is very extraordinary!"</P>
<P>Henrietta and her lover were left <HI>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te;</HI> &s;he felt embarra&s;&s;ed; and with the ill fortune that generally follows the attempt at di&s;pelling an awkward &s;ilence, ha&s;tily repeated her brother's words, that it <HI>was</HI> very extraordinary! Arundel, unable to re&s;i&s;t the temptation, advanced towards her.</P>
<P>"Will mi&s;s Villiers," &s;aid he, "do me the honour of becoming my confidante?"</P>
<P>"Mo&s;t undoubtedly," faltered &s;he, turning pale.</P>
<P>"And may I&mdash;dare I venture to tell her that there was yet another paper?"&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="037796_0098_100F28F802F337F0">
"Is it not better&mdash;would it not be right, I mean&mdash;why not rather tell my brother?" again incoherently cried Henrietta, &s;till paler than before.</P>
<P>"Becau&s;e," interrupted Arundel, "if my &s;ur|mi&s;es are true, the writing is too &s;acred to be prophaned by any eye but my own; becau&s;e on their deci&s;ion probably depends the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of my life; and becau&s;e," added he, taking it from his bo&s;om, "with mi&s;s Villiers alone it remains to tell me which."</P>
<P>She ca&s;t a timid eye upon the paper, and, too con&s;cious of the hand, as well as the probable purport of it, would have &s;unk from her chair, had not the &s;upporting arms of Arundel pre|vented her. He was at her feet when captain Villiers returned; nor could the latter forbear a&s;king with a &s;mile, whether the&s;e tender demon|&s;trations of regard were meant for the old friend, or the new one?</P>
<P>Arundel, who had not been able to re&s;olve on the journey of the morrow without previous ex|planation to both, now he&s;itated not to di&s;clo&s;e his whole heart. Villiere heard him with undi&s;|gui&s;ed plea&s;ure; and though not apprized, by any
<PB N="101" REF="037796_0099_100F291886AC9288">
part of the conver&s;ation, of his &s;i&s;ter's partiality, thought he ran no ri&s;que of violently offending her by &s;anctioning the hopes of her lover.</P>
<P>Plea&s;ure, however, is a fleeting good! So thought Arundel as he looked the next day through the dingy panes of gla&s;s in an inn window about thirty miles from London. His gaiety was not greatly increa&s;ed by the probability of having no|thing better to do than to look through them for two hours longer. Luxury had not yet provided for travellers as in more modern times; and the only po&s;t-hor&s;e the &s;tables afforded, Arundel, from a principle of humanity and good-nature, had re&s;igned to a gentleman whom the landlord had de&s;cribed to be in a &s;tate of agitation that be|&s;poke his journey a matter of the utmo&s;t importance. He was &s;omewhat tempted, however, to repent of his good-nature, when pa&s;&s;ing through the en|try he ca&s;t his eyes on this <HI>gentleman,</HI> and di&s;co|vered him to be the valet of lord Lind&s;ey; a man who had long reigned over his ma&s;ter with mo&s;t unbounded influence, and who&s;e in&s;olent manners rendered him the dete&s;tation of all within his circle.</P>
<P>"Ah, mr. Arundel," &s;aid Verney, &s;tarting at
<PB N="102" REF="037796_0100_100F28FA4DA20550">
the &s;ight of him, "is it you, then, to whom I am &s;o greatly obliged? You were always good and generous, and I am almo&s;t tempted&mdash;"</P>
<P>"To profit by the example, I hope," &s;aid A|rundel, coldly &s;miling, and pa&s;&s;ing on. The man &s;eemed &s;truck with the &s;peech.</P>
<P>"Mr. Arundel, for the love of Heaven, &s;top!" &s;aid he, eagerly &s;eizing his hand: favour me with a moment's conver&s;ation. It may be of more im|portance to you than you are aware of." Arundel he&s;itated; yet, &s;omewhat impre&s;&s;ed with his manner, went with him into an adjoining apart|ment. Verney &s;hut the door.</P>
<P>"You have been, &s;ir, for a long time now, the companion and intimate of my lord: you have been the confidant of many of his &s;ecrets; yet I believe&mdash;nay, I am very &s;ure, that you did not know him to be your brother."</P>
<P>"My brother! &s;aid Arundel, &s;tarting back with amazement.&mdash;"Lord Lind&s;ey my brother!"</P>
<P>"As &s;urely, &s;ir, as that he was the &s;educer of mi&s;s Loui&s;a, and the murderer of mr. Mortimer!"</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="037796_0101_100F2808AB396E00">
"Have a care, Verney, of what you &s;ay!" cried Arundel agha&s;t with horror.</P>
<P>"I can &s;tand to it upon oath, &s;ir, when, and where you plea&s;e; but my time is precious, and I mu&s;t tell my &s;tory in few words. It was ju&s;t after you &s;et out for Swi&s;&s;erland, mr. Arundel, that I came into confidence with my lord; I u&s;ed often to carry me&s;&s;ages and notes between him and ma'am&s;elle Loui&s;e; who, to &s;ay the truth, I believe courted him as much as he did her. However that was, he fell into a very great pa&s;&s;ion when he found that &s;he had told you of their corre&s;pon|dence, and &s;wore he would never &s;ee her more. Nay, he actually made you the &s;ame promi&s;e, or &s;omething like it, as you may remember, and left Lyons accordingly. His heart, however, failed him before he had gone many miles; for they were to have met that night&mdash;as I &s;hould have told you they often did&mdash;when mi&s;s Loui&s;e could make a pretence for getting out of the convent to vi&s;it her acquaintance. Nothing then would &s;erve my lord but returning; and a melancholy return it was for poor mr. Mortimer, whom we overtook as we pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;hort cut that leads to the high road. My lord at fir&s;t would have avoided him; but perceiving he was already
<PB N="104" REF="037796_0102_100F28FC793EFBC8">
known, determined to ride boldly on. They &s;oon came up with one another, and interchanged &s;a|lutations; not very civil. Some conver&s;ation en|&s;ued; and though I was at a di&s;tance, I could un|der&s;tand that mr. Mortimer upbraided my lord with treachery, and fal&s;ehood. <HI>Fal&s;ehood</HI> was the word. You may gue&s;s how this was taken; both of them fell into &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion that I verily believe they knew not what they &s;aid, or did: and as curio&s;ity drew me nearer, I di&s;tinctly heard mr. Mortimer tell my lord that he had no occa&s;ion to value him&s;elf upon his birth; that he was only a younger brother; and that you were both &s;on and heir to lord Lind&s;ey, as he could &s;ufficiently prove by letters then in his pocket-book. All my lord's pa&s;&s;ion before was nothing at all to this. As ill-luck would have it, we had pi&s;tols in the hol&s;ters for it was then du&s;k, and we were to go out of the city again that night.&mdash;To be &s;hort, I held their hor&s;es while they both fired, and I &s;aw mr. Mortimer drop. By my lord's command I my&s;elf took the pocket-book from him, for he, poor man! was quite gone; and away we rode as if the devil was behind us, and &s;o to be &s;ure he was. My lord was very moody, and, as I thought, very penitent; and often &s;aid he did not intend the old gentleman's death, but that it was an even
<PB N="105" REF="037796_0103_100F291E38DF6320">
chance, and therefore done in an honourable way. However, as honourable as it was, he made no &s;cruple of keeping the pocket-book, in which, &s;ure enough, there were &s;ome cho&s;en letters from the old lord, that &s;ufficiently confirmed the truth of mr. Mor|timer's &s;tory. Not that I got &s;ight of them at fir&s;t; &s;o far from it, that he would have per|&s;uaded me they contained nothing of con&s;equence. However, I knew my opportunities, and when I had once &s;een them, we u&s;ed to talk them over very often; and he even told me that he &s;hould never have fallen into &s;uch a rage at fir&s;t hearing of them, but that his father, when angry with him once, let fall an odd &s;aying, that dwelt upon his mind. All this, mr. Arundel, I will &s;ay, and &s;wear too!&mdash;As to the re&s;t, to be &s;ure it grieved me to &s;ee you forced by ill treatment to quit your own father's hou&s;e, and throw your&s;elf upon the wide world; while, on the other hand, my lord&mdash;" Here Verney began to &s;tammer, and A|rundel, to who&s;e overburdened and agitated mind a pau&s;e &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary, threw open the &s;a&s;h, and, leaning again&s;t the window-frame, endea|voured to recover a compo&s;ure of which the dreadful train of facts he had li&s;tened to, &s;eemed wholly to have deprived him.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="037796_0104_100F28FE17AE3D98">
"Well, mr. Arundel, I mu&s;t go," &s;aid Verney, abruptly &s;tarting up, as if him&s;elf awakened to &s;ome new recollections.</P>
<P>"Whither?" returned the other.</P>
<P>"That I can't immediately tell&mdash;Not to my lord, you may be &s;ure. This confounded gam|bling has &s;o ruined his temper, that a man had better live in Bedlam than with him. However, if you will tell me where a line may find you, depend upon receiving one 'ere long; and, if I can do you ju&s;tice, ju&s;tice you &s;hall have."</P>
<P>To part in &s;o light a manner with a te&s;timony of &s;uch importance, and of which he might be &s;o ea&s;ily deprived, either by corruption or accident, appeared &s;o Arundel the extreme of folly; and he urged every motive either of ju&s;tice, or intere&s;t, that might induce Verney to return with him to town. The man &s;eemed irre&s;olute, yet more inclined to pur&s;ue his own <HI>route,</HI> than that pointed out to him. The hor&s;e at length was brought to the door.</P>
<P>"Mr. Arundel," &s;aid Verney, as the former &s;till oppo&s;ed his departure, "what I have &s;aid may well &s;hew you how much I am di&s;po&s;ed to
<PB N="107" REF="037796_0105_100F291FCCC78BA0">
do you a &s;ervice. I will go greater lengths, however; but you mu&s;t fir&s;t &s;wear, that, after the proof I am going to give you of my confidence, you will neither attempt to follow, nor detain me a &s;ingle moment." Arundel he&s;itated; but, as no alternative pre&s;ented it&s;elf, at length complied with the requi&s;ition.</P>
<P>"<HI>There,</HI> &s;ir!" &s;aid Verney taking &s;ome papers from his portmanteau, "<HI>there</HI> are the very letters found in mr. Mortimer's pocket-book. A&s;k no que&s;tions, but remember your promi&s;e." So &s;ay|ing, he &s;natched up the portmanteau, ran ha&s;tily out of the room, and left Arundel in an a&s;toni&s;h|ment from which he was fir&s;t rou&s;ed by the clat|tering of the hor&s;e's hoofs.</P>
<P>The man was quickly out of &s;ight; but in his hand Arundel indeed held the &s;trange, the affecting te&s;timonials of his birth&mdash;&s;o long concealed, &s;o wonderfully brought to light. That Verney had robbed his lord could not be doubted; &s;o often doth "even handed ju&s;tice
<Q><L>Return th' ingredients of the poi&s;oned chalice</L>

<P>Had the &s;peed with which Arundel returned to town allowed more time for reflection, how new,
<PB N="108" REF="037796_0106_100F2901B54ED5D8">
how brilliant was the pro&s;pect that now opened before him! To conceal his birth was once ea&s;y, but to trace it could no longer be difficult. Mi&s;s Villiers rai&s;ed to fortune and rank by his means&mdash;mi&s;s Villiers, the ornament of his family, and the re&s;torer of her own, &s;wam before his imagi|nation, and diffu&s;ed an enchanting &s;en&s;e of plea|&s;ure throughout his heart&mdash;a plea&s;ure &s;oftened into grateful &s;en&s;ibility, when he recollected that he was paying to the daughter of Mortimer, tho&s;e dues his affection vainly lavi&s;hed on the a&s;hes of the father.</P>
<P>To captain Villiers his return was as de&s;irable as unexpected. A chance enquiry had already di&s;covered to him that Arundel was the original name of the Lind&s;ey family; and a compari&s;on of circum&s;tances had in&s;pired him with a &s;u&s;pi|cion of that truth now &s;o wonderfully confirmed. Yet Arundel the <HI>legal</HI> &s;on, the <HI>heir</HI> of a noble name, &s;urpa&s;&s;ed even his mo&s;t &s;anguine expecta|tions; and, in a tumult of various emotions, both friends repaired to the hou&s;e of lord Lind&s;ey, who&s;e concern in the death of Mortimer, how|ever, Arundel carefully &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. They were told he was indi&s;po&s;ed, and could &s;ee no one, but to a &s;ubterfuge apparently the re&s;ult either of
<PB N="109" REF="037796_0107_100F29224917CA10">

<P>"My lord wi&s;hes to &s;peak to mr. Arundel," &s;aid the &s;ervant, returning; "but captain Villiers he begs will excu&s;e him."</P>
<P>The verbal me&s;&s;age, the oftentatious approach, the ceremonious introduction, had already, in the bo&s;om of Arundel, repelled the generous tide of nature. Oh God! how did the impetuous cur|rent return upon his heart, when, &s;tretched on a couch at one end of a magnificent dre&s;&s;ing-room, he ca&s;t his eyes on the &s;pectre of that gay, and beautiful Lind&s;ey, whom he had parted with but &s;ix weeks before, blooming in health, and vigour|ous in youth!&mdash;A &s;igh&mdash;almo&s;t a groan of exqui|&s;ite angui&s;h bur&s;t from the heart of Arundel, as,
<PB N="110" REF="037796_0108_100F2903D7089758">
the hand of his brother, he bent his face over it in womani&s;h emotion. The &s;hort and &s;udden cough&mdash;the agonizing pain that &s;eemed to &s;eize upon lord Lind&s;ey, as in&s;tantly recalled his rea&s;on.</P>
<P>"My brother&mdash;my friend!" cried he incohe|rently, "recover&mdash;compo&s;e your&s;elf. I come not to upbraid. Oh, why," added he more vehe|mently, "did I mi&s;tru&s;t your me&s;&s;age? Why did I thus &s;uddenly force my&s;elf upon you?" Lord Lind&s;ey, choked by agitation, could not &s;peak; and Arundel, unable to witne&s;s &s;ufferings he could not a&s;&s;uage, flew into the anti-chamber, while the attendants admini&s;tered relief. From one of them he learnt what had in part effected this deva&s;ta|tion. Lord Lind&s;ey, a month before, had at|tended a rural <HI>f&ecirc;te</HI> given by the duche&s;s of Port&s;|mouth, where, after a night of dancing and vio|lent exce&s;s, he had fallen a&s;leep, undi&s;covered for many hours, upon the wet gra&s;s. The &s;ervant had no time for further information. Recalled by the found of his brother's voice, Arundel ea|gerly returned to the apartment. The former tenderly pre&s;&s;ed his hand, and by &s;low and painful efforts was now able to &s;peak. But the long-la|vi&s;hed hours of pro&s;perity and health, that make atonement virtue, were lo&s;t to Lind&s;ey; and
<PB N="111" REF="037796_0109_100F29278234D5A8">
though in &s;peaking he failed not to render Arundel a noble ju&s;tice, yet from it, his own bo&s;om ex|tracted not that balm which might in happier days have proved &s;o healing.</P>
<P>It was not, however, without an exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;e of &s;uffering, that his generous brother di&s;covered Verney to be a principal in&s;trument in the cata&s;|trophe which the appearance of Lind&s;ey an|nounced to be &s;o near; a &s;uffering con&s;iderably augmented, when he found that it was to a latent &s;park of tenderne&s;s and remor&s;e in the latter, he had owed the two hundred pounds lodged for his u&s;e at the banker's.</P>
<P>Hardly had lord Lind&s;ey got rid of &s;ome of tho&s;e alarming &s;ymptoms which were produced by the violent and dangerous cold he had taken, when Verney, who was dre&s;&s;ing him, one morn|ing encroached &s;o far upon his u&s;ual in&s;olence as to exa&s;perate a temper already peevi&s;h and fretful. In a tran&s;port of rage, lord Lind&s;ey &s;truck him. The brutal precedent was not lo&s;t: Verney re|turned the blow. A violent &s;truggle en&s;ued be|tween them; and before Lind&s;ey had either time or recollection to ring his bell, he was thrown again&s;t a cabinet that &s;tood near, with a force that
