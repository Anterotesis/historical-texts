<Q><HI>When thou goe&s;t out to battle again&s;t thine enemies, and &s;ee&s;t hor&s;es and chariots, and a people more than thou, be not afraid of them; for the Lord thy God is with thee, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.</HI></Q>

<P>_THAT mankind &s;hould in any ca&s;e, be voluntarily active, in taking away the lives of tho&s;e of their own &s;pecies, is a lamentable evidence and con&s;equence of human depravity.&mdash;If man had retain|ed his integrity, and continued in a &s;tate of peace with heaven, no part of this earth would ever have been a &s;eat of war: Angels would have been his friendly gue&s;ts, &s;entitive creatures his willing &s;ervants&punc; and the whole human race knit together in mutual love. Apo&s;tate angels however inimica|bly di&s;po&s;ed, might have envied, but could not have impaired his happine&s;s, or di&s;turbed his peace. But human beings, by joining with tho&s;e degene|rate &s;pirits, in an impotent rebellion again&s;t God, the rightful, righteous and good &s;overeign of the univer&s;e, have introduced &s;uch calamity and con|fu&s;ion, that there is ordinarily more danger from the injurious attempts of fellow-creatures, than from all the bea&s;ts of prey. And however the

excellency of man con&s;i&s;ts, not in bodily &s;trength, but mental endowments; yet &s;uch di&s;putes do &s;ometimes ari&s;e, as mu&s;t be decided, not by &s;trength of argument in deliberative a&s;&s;emblies, but by force of arms in the field of battle.</P>
<P>Human affairs, on &s;ome occa&s;ions, come to be in &s;uch a &s;ituation, that we mu&s;t either &s;ubmit to death, or intolerable injuries our&s;elves, or en|deavour to inflict death on the aggre&s;&s;ors. In a word, an equitable and honorable peace, can, at times, be obtained on no other condition, than that of engaging in a bloody war; and there a|ri&s;es a nece&s;&s;ity of taking &s;uch a method as mu&s;t inevitably remove &s;ome out of this world, in or|der that tho&s;e who &s;urvive may be the more com|fortable; hence making war, or &s;hedding the blood of tho&s;e of our own kind, comes to be a nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s; and it is then as much our duty to go to the field of battle, as at ordinary times, to go to the field of labour.</P>
<P>And as the Jewi&s;h &s;tate was a theocracy, in which God gave them a compleat body of laws, re&s;pecting things both civil &amp; &s;acred; &s;o in our text and &s;ucceeding context, we have a part of their martial law, or divine directions re&s;pecting their militia. However different the weapons of war, whether offen&s;ive or defen&s;ive, may have been in different ages and countries; and con&s;equently the art or manner of war, variable; yet what is recommended in our text, namely, <HI>courage,</HI> has always been a nece&s;&s;ary qualification in an accom|pli&s;hed &s;oldier. Intrepidity is as e&s;&s;ential to the character of a good warrior, as a di&s;po&s;ition for di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate enquiry and cool deliberation is ne|ce&s;&s;arily contained in the idea of a good judge. And as all &s;cripture has been given by in&s;piration of God, and is in one re&s;pect or another profi|table; &s;o the con&s;ideration of the pa&s;&s;age which
<PB N="5" REF="042802_0005_101C94BF1B7CF4F0">
I have now read, cannot appear in pre&s;ent circum|&s;tances un&s;ea&s;onable,&mdash;We are reduced to the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of a war, which will perhaps be more ob|&s;tinate, and is certainly more di&s;agreeable in its nature, and exten&s;ive in its effects, than any in which, either the whole or part of the American Briti&s;h colonies have heretofore been engaged.&mdash;Since then, we know not, how &s;oon even the hu&s;bandman, however agreeable their employ|ment is to them&s;elves and u&s;eful to others, may be obliged to change the implements of hu&s;ban|dry for the weapons of war, and march forth to battle; it will certainly be comfortable for them|&s;elves, and hopeful for others, that they take the field with that temper pre&s;cribed, and having the encouragement contained in our text.&mdash;For this purpo&s;e therefore, I &s;hall &s;hew

univer&s;e has implanted in our natures, in com|mon with other living creatures.&mdash;That war was lawful under the Old-Te&s;tament di&s;pen&s;ation is &s;o evident, that none who acknowledge the autho|rity of the Bible, can deny it.&mdash;The apprehen&s;ion that Chri&s;t has under the New-Te&s;tament intirely prohibited the u&s;e of the &s;word, has ari&s;en from a mi&s;under&s;tanding and wrong application of &s;ome of his precepts, which were evidently de&s;igned by him to injoin meekne&s;s and a forgiving temper upon his followers, and to prevent private retali|ation and revenge.&mdash;I will, however, grant to tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians, who declare again&s;t the u&s;e of the &s;word in every ca&s;e&punc; that, as Chri&s;t's kingdom is &s;piritual and erected for heavenly purpo&s;es;&mdash;&s;o no coercive mea&s;ures ought to be u&s;ed in promoting it, under any pretence what|&s;oever.&mdash;The &s;ubjects of Chri&s;t's kingdom, as &s;uch, or con&s;idered in that capacity, ought to u&s;e no other means, in propagating Chri&s;tianity, but &s;uch as were u&s;ed by Chri&s;t him&s;elf and his apo|&s;tles; the weapons of who&s;e warfare, was not carnal but mighty.&mdash;If we con&s;ider the Chri&s;tian, as &s;uch, purely with re&s;pect to his &s;piritual and eternal intere&s;ts, his panoply or compleat armour is de&s;cribed in the &s;ixth chapter of the Epi&s;tle to the Ephe&s;ians; nor is he to repel injuries which only affect his &s;piritual good, with any other, but the&s;e &s;piritual weapons.&mdash;But as per&s;ons becoming Chri&s;tians, does not &s;upercede their being con&s;i|dered as Mathematicians, A&s;tronomers, Mecha+nicks or Labourers; &s;o neither does it nullify the relations and rights as men and civil &s;ubjects Now, although the Mathematician may not pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">+tend to either demon&s;trate or illu&s;trate the tru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> of Chri&s;tianity&punc; by geometrical figures, or th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">+rems; yet no one of common &s;en&s;e will alled<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> that he may not u&s;e the&s;e, in mathematical

<P>It is al&s;o to be admitted, that making war, merely for the purpo&s;e of inlarging an empire, kingdom or commonwealth; or for acquiring fame by conque&s;t, is altogether unlawful.&mdash;Hence Alex|ander the great, rather de&s;erves the name of an invincible murderer, and &s;ucce&s;sful plunderer, than that of an illu&s;trious hero.</P>
<P>It will therefore follow, that all the particular ca&s;es, in which a war can be lawful, will come under one or other of the&s;e generals, <HI>viz.</HI>&mdash;It mu&s;t if it be offen&s;ive, be undertaken by &s;pecial com|mi&s;&s;ion from God, who has a right to employ whom he plea&s;es, as the executioners of his ju&s;tice; or it mu&s;t be defen&s;ive, occa&s;ioned by &s;ome injury which re&s;pects our temporal intere&s;t, either at|tempted or inflicted.&mdash;As to the fir&s;t of the&s;e, no war &s;ince immediate revelation has cea&s;ed, can be in this re&s;pect, legitimate: Since no nation can now produce a commi&s;&s;ion from God, to invade any other nation, from whom they have received no injury.&mdash;With regard to the &s;econd, it may take place either between &s;eparate independent &s;tates, or different parts of the &s;ame &s;tate.</P>

1. When one &s;tate invades the lives, liberty or property of another, and per&s;i&s;ts in the injurious conduct; or refu&s;es to make reparation for inju|ries already committed, then is it not only lawful but duty, for the invaded nation, to go forth to battle again&s;t them; and commit the event to the Almighty God, the judge of the univer&s;e.&mdash;But here perhaps it will be queried&mdash;Since it belongs to the Supreme power, or governing part of a nation, to make war and peace, how &s;hall all of the nation, who may be called to bear arms, be certain that there is cau&s;e &s;ufficient to legitimate a war? To which it may be an&s;wered, That or|dinarily the injuries committed are &s;o notorious, that all may be acquainted with them: Or if this is not the ca&s;e, unle&s;s it appear evident that the war is not defen&s;ive, but offen&s;ive, the &s;ubjects mu&s;t confide in the integrity and equity of their rulers; and if the war be even unju&s;t, on account of &s;ome circum&s;tances, well known to the rulers, but concealed from the &s;ubjects, the rulers alone, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, are chargeable with guilt.&mdash;As one man is not called to act in the &s;phere of another; &s;o neither is he to be accountable for another's mi&s;management, further than he approves of, or knowingly joins with him, in his culpable con|duct.&mdash;Notwith&s;tanding, as the avowed de&s;ign of war, is the &s;hedding of human blood: &s;o it will tend much to the &s;atisfaction of a con&s;cientious &s;oldier, to have clear evidence, in his own mind, that the war, in which he is engaged, is ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P N="2">2. A war may commence, betwixt different parts of the &s;ame &s;tate, and this is u&s;ually called, civil-war; and it may be lawful and nece&s;&s;ary to go forth to battle again&s;t tho&s;e of the &s;ame body po|litic, in two particular ca&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="042802_0009_101C94CBD0723480">
Fir&s;t, when part of a nation violate the origi|nal compact, break laws made agreeable to the con&s;titution of the &s;ociety, throw off their alle|giance to the executive power of the &s;tate, and at|tempt to &s;et up rulers of their own, or to conti|nue in a &s;tate of anarchy. This is u&s;ually called &s;edition or rebellion, and when the in&s;urgents are &s;ubdued, it is generally thought ju&s;t, to treat them with greater &s;everity, than conquered enemies, when the war is with a foreign &s;tate. And, in|deed, when the attempts, of part of a &s;tate, are really rebellious, it appears equitable, not only to go to war again&s;t them, but to make &s;uch as &s;ur|vive, at lea&s;t, the principal leaders, examples of ju&s;tice, as being guilty not only of injury, but of perfidy and ingratitude.</P>
<P>Second, when the governing part of a nation, attempt to abu&s;e the power committed to them, and in&s;tead of &s;ub&s;erving the intere&s;ts of the peo|ple, endeavour to &s;ubvert the con&s;titution, employ|ing their influence and authority, not for the good of the &s;ubjects, but to promote their own ambi|tious and tyrannical de&s;igns; then is it, not only lawful, but duty, to oppo&s;e them, and if they per&s;i&s;t, to u&s;e the &s;word again&s;t them. I &s;hall not enter deeply into the proof of this po&s;ition, which has not only been clearly illu&s;trated, in theory, but was found nece&s;&s;ary in practice, in our own nation, at that critical and memorable aera, the revolution; &s;ince which time, the doctrine of unlimited pa&s;&s;ive obedience and non-re&s;i&s;tance has been exploded by Britons.&mdash;I &s;hall, however, ob|&s;erve a few things to prevent the abu&s;e of it.&mdash;And, in the fir&s;t place, agreeable to what has been before &s;aid, I think it is evident, that Chri|&s;tians, as &s;uch, or con&s;idered as Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> never to oppo&s;e civil-government, merely for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he &s;ake of its being unfavourable to the princi|ples

When they have clear evidence, that the war on their &s;ide is lawful and nece&s;&s;ary&mdash;when it is not with ambitious, or avaricious veiws, of ac|quiring honour, or wealth, by the de&s;truction or poverty of others, who have not injured them; but only to repel injurious attempts, or obtain re|paration for injuries received. This is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, in order to having any ground of en|couragement from God. For if any interprize be a violation of the rights of our fellow-creatures, and con&s;equently a breach of God's law, as it would be vain to expect his approbation and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, in &s;uch a ca&s;e; &s;o it would be daring pre|&s;umption, if not bla&s;phemy, to a&s;k his pre&s;ence. If we would expect the Lord graciou&s;ly to accom|pany us, we mu&s;t carefully ob&s;erve not to turn a&s;ide from what his holy law pre&s;cribes. If in any undertaking we deviate from this, we have ju&s;t rea&s;on to expect, that God, in that affair, will for&s;ake us; nay &s;et him&s;elf again&s;t us. If the I&s;raelites, contrary to the expre&s;s command of God, will a&s;cend the hill, to &s;ight with the Ama|lekites and Canaanites, they &s;hall return &s;hame|fully beaten; as may be &s;een Numb. 14th chap. latter part.</P>
<P N="2">2. When tho&s;e who in a lawful and nece&s;&s;ary war go out to battle, are them&s;elves engaged in
<PB N="14" REF="042802_0014_101C94DA4F91A820">
earne&s;tly &s;oliciting the divine pre&s;ence. However prayer is neither to be &s;uppo&s;ed to produce any change in God, nor to have any thing in it meri|torious of the favours a&s;ked, nor to convey in|formation to God of things with which he was unacquainted; yet it is a powerful medium, for the obtaining of ble&s;&s;ings, both temporal and &s;pi|ritual. There is little rea&s;on to conclude, that God will give, what per&s;ons don't think worth while humbly and importunately to a&s;k; and we are not only unworthy of, but al&s;o unfit for, the enjoyment of tho&s;e &s;pecial favours, which we neg|lect to &s;eek to God for. It is indeed an awful and mournful reflection, that even in the Briti&s;h ar|mies, whether land or &s;ea forces, in which, per|haps, few would be found who have not by bap|ti&s;m been inli&s;ted under Chri&s;t; yet few of either officers of &s;oldiers, but what are more remarkable for cur&s;ing and &s;wearing than praying.&mdash;God forbid that our American armies, who have at this day to be their oppo&s;ers, &s;hould, in this thing, be their imitators!</P>
<P>It would be impo&s;&s;ible, in the time proper for this part of the di&s;cour&s;e, to produce all the in|&s;tances, in which God in an&s;wer to prayer, has manife&s;ted his pre&s;ence in deciding battles.&mdash;You, have two remarkable in&s;tances, recorded in 1 Sam. vii. chap. and 2 Chron. xx. chap.&mdash;In the fir&s;t of the&s;e, you have an account of a monumental pil|lar, rai&s;ed in the field of battle and victory, and in&s;cribed to the honour of a prayer-hearing God, and for the encouragement of future officers and &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd, you find that God was &s;o inte|re&s;ted, by a powerful prayer, that he did not merely grant auxiliary aid, but was the &s;ole effi|cient, leaving nothing for Jeho&s;aphat and his ar|my to do, but to carry away the &s;poil. Allow me
<PB N="15" REF="042802_0015_101C94DD724FF588">
to add, the in&s;tance of David, who tru&s;ting more to a prayer-hearing God, than to Saul's coat of mail, went out with a &s;ling and &s;tone; but return|ed with Goliah's head, and thereby obtained a ge|neral victory. In &s;hort, tho&s;e are mo&s;t likely to be &s;ucce&s;sful combatants in battle, who are the mo&s;t importunate wre&s;tlers in prayer.</P>
<P N="3">3. When an army maintains a reverence of a holy God, and are afraid to venture on any of the ways of known &s;in. Tho&s;e may expect the pre|&s;ence of God when fighting again&s;t the enemies of their bodies, who are irreconcileable, in their war, again&s;t the enemies of God and their own &s;ouls. And without this, the foregoing will be nothing but &s;olemn mockery of God; in words &s;o|liciting his pre&s;ence, and by our actions telling him to depart from us. It may, perhaps, &s;eem un&s;uitable to &s;peak of a &s;oldier being afraid of any thing; but I would &s;ay, wo to the man, who is above the fear of &s;in, and does not tremble at the word of God.&mdash;Shocking to think that any &s;hould value them&s;elves for their fighting again&s;t God! Let the pot&s;heards of the earth, &s;trive with the pot&s;heards of the earth; but wo to him, that &s;triveth with his Maker. You have an example of this, in the above-mentioned 7th of 1 Sam. from the 3d ver&s;e. <HI>And Samuel &s;pake unto all the hou&s;e of I&s;rael, &s;aying, if ye do return unto the Lord with all your hearts, then put away the &s;trange Gods, and A&s;taroth, from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the Lord, and &s;erve him only; and he will de|liver you out of the hand of the Phili&s;tines. Then the children of I&s;rael did put away. Baalim and A&s;taroth, and &s;erved the Lord only.</HI> But it is needle&s;s to multiply quotations on this head, &s;ince it is evi|dent from rea&s;on, and the whole tenor of reve|lation, that &s;in is the very cau&s;e, why God per|mits enemies to invade a people; there is there|fore
<PB N="16" REF="042802_0016_101C94E2716DE288">
no encouragement, to expect that God will appear for us, unle&s;s we abandon our &s;ins, which have provoked him to &s;end war upon our country. And however wicked &s;oldiers may, indeed, be in&s;trumental of gaining a victory; yet unle&s;s re|pentance prevent, they &s;hall at la&s;t find, it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God, when their oppo&s;ition, will only increa&s;e their mi&s;ery.</P>
<P N="4">4. When tho&s;e who go out to battle manife&s;t an humble temper, neither boa&s;ting of their number and abilities; nor &s;cornfully de&s;pi&s;ing their ene|mies, but committing the event to God. God de|clares that he re&s;i&s;ts the proud, but &s;hews favour to the humble. It has ordinarily been found, that tho&s;e who went to the field of battle, magnifying their own &s;trength and warlike-accompli&s;hments; and contemning their enemies; thus as it were anticipating the victory, have either fallen by the&s;e &s;ame de&s;pi&s;ed enemies, or returned with a different tone, and in&s;tead of their laurels, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> only bring the news of a &s;hameful defeat. Many in&s;tances, from &s;acred and common hi&s;tory, might be adduced for the illu&s;tration and confirmation of this, were it nece&s;&s;ary and would time admit. The fates <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> a proud Pharoah, an in&s;olent Gollah, and a boa&s;ting Sennacherib are familiar to all. Let none think, that humility is incon&s;i&s;tent with the character of a &s;oldier. Humility belongs to us as creatures, and is a dre&s;s that becomes per|&s;ons in every &s;tation and condition. There is a great difference betwixt o&s;tentatious bragging and couragious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. Pride is a concomitant of pu&s;illanimity, and is oppo&s;ed to true magnanimity. Tho&s;e who va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ly and proudly vaunt, of their own &s;kill and prow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> do thereby preclude the divine pre&s;ence and a&s;&s;i&s;tance; &s;ince they hereby manife&s;t, that they look upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;uperfluous, for a God to in|terpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="17" REF="042802_0017_101C94E5903A57B8">
5. When tho&s;e on who&s;e behalf the army march|es to the field of battle, are al&s;o employed in ear|ne&s;t prayer to God, in confe&s;&s;ing their &s;ins and ca&s;ting away every abomination; not boa&s;ting of, nor confiding in, the number, prowe&s;s, di&s;cipline and armour of their troops; but humbly commit|ting the event to God, who can &s;ave, by many or by few.&mdash;Doubtle&s;s we may venture to &s;ay, how|ever to &s;ome it might appear a paradox, that tho&s;e who remain at home, and never go out to battle, have notwith&s;tanding, a great hand in the victory or defeat. If we fight again&s;t the Lord at home, how can we expect that he will fight for our ar|mies abroad? There may be Achans in the city and country, as well as in the &s;oldiery; by whom God may be &s;o provoked, as to refu&s;e to go forth with our armies; on the other hand, per&s;ons may as truly be in&s;trumental of an happy campaign in their fields and clo&s;ets, as tho&s;e who charge upon the enemy in the line of battle. When I&s;rael fought with Amalek, as recorded in the 17th of Exodus, neither Mo&s;es, Aaron, nor Hur, were ei|ther field-mar&s;hals or common &s;oldiers, but were at a di&s;tance upon the top of an hill; yet none who read this part of &s;acred hi&s;tory, can exclude them from a &s;hare in obtaining the victory. Tho&s;e who&s;e lives are a counter-part to their prayers, and are employed in &s;torming heaven with their importunate &s;upplications, may be as u&s;eful to their country, when a &s;eat of war, as tho&s;e who bombard ca&s;tles and &s;cale walls!</P>
<P>In a lawful war, when any of the&s;e things is found, it is &s;o far a good &s;ymptom, when they are all found, there is full evidence of God's favoura|ble pre&s;ence.&mdash;But I am now to proceed to &s;hew how this in&s;pires with true courage.</P>
<P>III. True courage is a temper or di&s;po&s;ition, by which a man, with firm re&s;olution and boldne&s;s
<PB N="18" REF="042802_0018_101C94E74E9DF568">
encounters the dangers, which occur in the path of his duty, repelling or re&s;i&s;ting to his utmo&s;t, all intervening difficulties.&mdash;As this temper re|&s;pects the character of a &s;oldier, it is oppo&s;ed to what is commonly called cowardice; which either influences a man to &s;hrink and flee from, even tho&s;e dangers, which lie in the way of his duty; or cau&s;es him to make but a feeble and ineffectual re&s;i&s;tance.&mdash;And I might ob&s;erve, that an appre|&s;ion of the favour and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of even fal&s;e gods, had a tendency, in heatheni&s;h armies, to produce &s;omething which had &s;undry of the ingredients and much re&s;embled true courage; and this how|ever ill-founded, had after a great influence in procuring victory.&mdash;When the &s;oldiers were ani|mated, with what they counted a lucky omen, or by a favourable an&s;wer from an oracle, they would ordinarily exert them&s;elves, with the ut|mo&s;t vigor.&mdash;It has al&s;o been often found, that a fal&s;e apprehen&s;ion, of the favourable pre&s;ence of the true God, has produced &s;uch effects, as in &s;e|veral re&s;pects were &s;imilar to true heroi&s;m.&mdash;With what irre&s;i&s;tible violence and rapidity, did the fol|lowers of Mahomet over-run many of the ea&s;tern countries, when po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the notion that they were fighting the Lord's battles?&mdash;With what en|thu&s;ia&s;tic fortitude, did hundreds of thou&s;ands ex|ert them&s;elves in the cru&s;ades, or the wild project of recovering the Holy Land from the Infidels? In which enterprize, they thought that God was undoubtedly upon their &s;ide, and therefore were fearle&s;s of danger. None can therefore doubt concerning the powerful operation of a well-grounded apprehen&s;ion, of the favourable pre|&s;ence of the true God. But I am to &s;hew how this in&s;pires with true courage.</P>
<P N="1">1. There is contained in it, an evidence of the divine approbation in the undertaking, which
<PB N="19" REF="042802_0019_101C94EA66C0D660">
affords peace of mind, let the i&s;&s;ue be as it will; without this there can be no rational, manly cou|rage; becau&s;e a view of the unlawfulne&s;s of the enterprize, when&s;oever it occurs mu&s;t make the man quake, le&s;t God him&s;elf &s;hould meet him as a bear robbed of her whelps.</P>
<P N="2">2. It contains divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance and protection; and if God be for us, who can prevail again&s;t us? What general or army &s;hall be able to circumvent in coun&s;el, one who is omni&s;cient and infinitely wi&s;e; or exceed in &s;trength and prowe&s;s, one who is Almighty? Who has an arm like God, or can thunder with a voice like him? All the inhabi|tants of the earth are but as gra&s;shoppers before him; yea all the &s;quadrons of hell quake before him; and &s;hrink into the burning pit, to hide from his maje&s;tic and terrible countenance.</P>
<P N="3">3. A &s;en&s;e of the divine pre&s;ence, in a war gives occa&s;ion to con&s;ider all the deliverances God has wrought for his people, in former times; and to improve the&s;e as an encouragement to expect his interpo&s;ition at that time; for he is the &s;ame ye|&s;terday, to-day and forever.&mdash;Thus the people of I&s;rael, when invironed with new difficulties, u&s;u|ally recount old deliverances, and particularly the wonderful deliverance mentioned in our text, <HI>viz.</HI> bringing them up out of the land of Egypt. In re&s;pect of that colony which is at pre&s;ent the &s;eat of war, it may be al&s;o &s;aid, that God did great things for their ance&s;tors, which I cannot but think affords encouragement to hope, that he will not now for&s;ake that people.&mdash;They were brought from a land, then groaning under op|pre&s;&s;ion in regard of religious liberty, and &s;tained with the blood of per&s;ecution, not through the Red-&s;ea, but acro&s;s the Atlantic; and pre&s;erved through all the difficulties and dangers attending a &s;ettlement among wild bea&s;ts and &s;avages.&mdash;A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l
<PB N="20" REF="042802_0020_101C94F0EAA8EDD0">
who read the hi&s;tory of the planting and progre&s;s of the colony of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, may find great in&s;tances of God's goodne&s;s, to that people in for|mer times, of which I cannot at pre&s;ent give even a general account.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, If we have the pre&s;ence of God when going to battle, and are intere&s;ted in his favour, then we may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that whether we &s;urvive the engagement, or die in the field, all &s;hall be well. If our &s;ouls are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the fear of the Lord, we need not fear them, who can only kill the body. A &s;oul prepared for Heaven, will as ea&s;ily and joyfully (perhaps I may &s;ay more &s;o) find its way thither, from a field of battle, as from a bed of down; will as chearfully a&s;cend from amid&s;t roaring cannon, as weeping friends. As God is with his people in danger, &s;o al&s;o in death, which is to them an end of all danger. Can then, any thing &s;o effectually in&s;pire a &s;oldier with true courage, as that which rai&s;es him above the fear of death; nay makes death it&s;elf appear a de&s;ire|able event? <HI>For ble&s;&s;ed are the dead which die in the Lord, &s;ince they re&s;t from their labours, and their works follow them.</HI> I now proceed to make &s;ome practical improvement.</P>
<P N="1">1. As, agreeable to what was &s;aid in the intro|duction, we are at pre&s;ent in a &s;tate of war, it will be very proper to enquire, whether, agree|able to the doctrine, it be on our &s;ide a lawful and nece&s;&s;ary war, <HI>i. e.</HI> whether it be, indeed, de|fen&s;ive. As time will not admit of prolixity, I &s;hall only attempt a brief view of the matter, which I hope, notwith&s;tanding, will contain evi|dence &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy every competent en|quirer, who is free from invincible prejudice.</P>
<P>I therefore ob&s;erve, that all the late acts of the Briti&s;h Parliament, which by their united opera|tion have at length brought on a civil war, have
<PB N="21" REF="042802_0021_101C94F26EF11318">
flowed from a declaratory &s;tatute, made &s;ome years ago; or at lea&s;t are built upon it, as their true foundation. In which &s;tatute, there is this remarkable clau&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>That all his Maje&s;ty's Colonies and Plantations in America have been, are and of right ought to be, &s;ubordinate to and dependent upon the Imperial Crown and Parliament of Great-Britain; who have full power and authority to make laws and &s;tatutes of &s;ufficient validity to bind the Colonies and people of America, &s;ubjects of the Crown of Great-Britain, in all ca&s;es what&s;oever.</Q></P>
<P>Now this is a ba&s;is, not only broad enough to &s;upport all the late acts complained of and re|mon&s;trated again&s;t by the Colonies, but is a &s;uffi|cient foundation for a &s;y&s;tem of tyranny, both civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tic. Since the time may come, when the whole of Great-Britain, may bear no greater proportion to the Briti&s;h Colonies, either with regard to circuit or number of inhabitants, than one of our counties now do to a province; and yet this va&s;t extent of country &s;hall have no other &s;ecurity again&s;t tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion, but the complexion of the Briti&s;h Parliament, the evils incident to which we can neither prevent nor re|medy. As we have no hand in chu&s;ing any of the Members of Parliament, &s;o we mu&s;t according to &s;aid &s;tatute, be, not merely the &s;ubjects of the Imperial Crown of Great-Britain, but the &s;laves of the Parliament of Great-Britain. As they may drain away our property by heavy taxes, to be ab|&s;orbed in di&s;charging the almo&s;t immen&s;e nation|al debt, or con&s;umed in court luxury; &s;o they may &s;end pen&s;ioners and placemen to devour the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ruits of our indu&s;try among our&s;elves.</P>
<P>Now, in defence of this act, it is alledged, that, according to a theorem in politics, there mu&s;t, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">very civil &s;tate, be a &s;upreme power lodged &s;ome|where,
<PB N="22" REF="042802_0022_101C94F3F1DD03C0">
that it e&s;&s;entially belongs to tho&s;e, who have this &s;upreme power, to give laws, in all ca&s;es, to the whole body politic.&mdash;That in the em|pire of Great-Britain, this power is lodged in the Parliament, and that it mu&s;t be &s;o in order that the&s;e Colonies may be a part of the Briti&s;h empire.</P>
<P>To which it may be replied, that it is vain to urge any kind of hypothetical maxims again&s;t plain matter of fact. Tacitus, who was in his day no mean politician, allowed that a mixture of the three &s;imple kinds of civil government, had indeed a &s;pecious appearance in theory; but was not reducible to practice, or at lea&s;t alledged that no &s;uch government could be la&s;ting.&mdash;But in con|tradiction of this &s;uppo&s;ition, it is now a well known fact, that the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, which is &s;uch a mixture, has exi&s;ted for hundreds of years. It is as well known, that the Colonies and Great-Britain have exi&s;ted as one &s;tate, for above 100 years, with mutual concord and pro&s;perity, and with the great augmentation of the wealth and glory of the Briti&s;h nation, without the ex|erci&s;e of &s;uch unlimited power in the Briti&s;h Par|liament. And it is too likely, that if the Mini&s;try of Great-Britain per&s;i&s;t in not only claiming but attempting to exerci&s;e &s;uch a power, this will be the very thing that will effect her ruin. Now if &s;uch an unlimited power has lain dormant for above a century, and yet every thing as comfort|able in the whole body politic as could be wi&s;hed, what avails it to alledge a metaphy&s;ical axiom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> again&s;t evident fact. The reducing this political principle to practice, in our nation, if effected, is likely to be a growing rod of iron to the Colonies whereas it might, for any thing that appeared re|&s;pecting the&s;e Colonies, have been con&s;umed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">, without any detriment to the nation. How ever if Briti&s;h politicians, have found &s;uch a gor|dian
<PB N="23" REF="042802_0023_101C94F8E5B44478">
knot in politics, as admits of no alternative, but &s;ubjecting the Colonies, in all re&s;pects, to the mercy of a Parliament, about which they have no more agency, than they have about the Court of Spain, it is evidently of their own tieing; and it is the intere&s;t and duty of the&s;e Colonies, rather than be thus entangled, Alexander-like, to cut it with the &s;word. The pre&s;ent war is therefore on our &s;ide manife&s;tly in defence of property and li|berty, and I may add of life too. It is al&s;o noto|rions, that neither before nor &s;ince the attempts upon our liberty, have we thrown off allegiance to King George the Third, nor attempted to &s;et up any form of government, as an independent &s;tate; but on the contrary, in an humble manner, been repre&s;enting grievances, petitioning and re|mon&s;trating. Be&s;ides the penalties annexed to the injurious laws, armies have been &s;ent to enforce obedience, who have already proceeded to &s;hed the blood of our brethren. The alternative, in &s;hort, now is either to wear the chain or the &s;word.</P>
<P N="2">2. As different conduct comes to be duty at dif|ferent times; &s;o it is now the duty of all, who are able, to be in readine&s;s for going out to battle, and therefore to be making every nece&s;&s;ary prepa|ration for that purpo&s;e. It is now as proper to be diligent in learning the bu&s;ine&s;s of war, as at or|dinary times to learn the common bu&s;ine&s;&s;es of life. And for per&s;ons to &s;ay, they are &s;o hurried with ordinary affairs, that they have no time to &s;pare that way, is as if a man &s;hould &s;ay, though his hou&s;e was on fire, he had no time to put it out. All capable of going to battle &s;hould endeavour to be furni&s;hed with the weapons of war. If the ex|igency of the ca&s;e required it, we &s;hould now, beat our plow-&s;hares into &s;words, and our pruning-hooks into &s;pears. This is by no means repug|nant
<PB N="24" REF="042802_0024_101C94FC1B64FC38">
to, nay it is nece&s;&s;arily contained in, tru&s;t|ing in the Lord and expecting his favourable pre|&s;ence. To tru&s;t in means alone, and neglect &s;eek|ing to God, is pride and athei&s;m; to pretend to tru&s;t in God, and at the &s;ame time to neglect the u&s;e of proper means, is fooli&s;h pre&s;umption and wild enthu&s;ia&s;m. Nor are any to look upon them|&s;elves above the bu&s;ine&s;s nece&s;&s;ary to prepare them for war; the mo&s;t reputable citizens, and tho&s;e who have endeavoured to maintain a character for piety, ought now to endeavour to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves as brave &s;oldiers. How &s;hameful, if the licentious and profane, &s;hould manife&s;t more forwardne&s;s and alacrity this way, than tho&s;e who formerly were of apparent pious deportment?

And here, let me exhort &s;oldiers to pre&s;erve the &s;tricte&s;t regard to the authority of their officers, in all their gradations. The more you duly honour and obey them, the more ho|nourable will you thereby be, your&s;elves; and the more fit for, and worthy of, preferment.&mdash;None more fit to be advanced to command others, than tho&s;e who have been eminent for their duti|ful obedience. A family cannot exi&s;t without go|vernment and di&s;cipline, much le&s;s an army. And &s;urely if a hou&s;e divided again&s;t it&s;elf cannot &s;tand, a rebellious and mutinous &s;oldiery mu&s;t go to de&s;truction. This way they will do the work of the enemy, them&s;elves. It will avail nothing to &s;ay your officers were formerly your equals, they are now by your own con&s;ent your &s;uperiors. As little to the purpo&s;e, will it be to &s;ay, you will not obey the&s;e, for though they were appointed by a majority, yet you voted again&s;t them, and for others. Were they not cho&s;en agreeable to the mode agreed upon, and to which you con&s;ent|ed, or at lea&s;t, &s;hould have con&s;ented, as being generally approved, by your countrymen? Your refu&s;ing &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, on this &s;uppo&s;ition, proceeds from a principle, which might lead to as great evils, or wor&s;e, than tho&s;e which might give oc|ca&s;ion to the di&s;tinction of &s;oldiers and officers at this day; for if it does not lead to tyranny, it will certainly end in anarchy. You might as well &s;ay, you would not &s;ubmit to the Sheriff of the country, becau&s;e at the general election you voted again&s;t him. Permit me al&s;o in a few words, to exhort <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> of all ranks.&mdash;As your country have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> you to di&s;tingui&s;hed places, endeavour to
<PB N="26" REF="042802_0026_101C9500AFF16448">
di&s;tingui&s;h your&s;elves by a conduct in all re&s;pects becoming your &s;tations. Let them not have rea|&s;on to &s;ay, that they were mi&s;taken in their choice. Exerci&s;e the authority committed to you with mildne&s;s and equity; but at the &s;ame time with inflexible &s;trictne&s;s. A due mixture of the&s;e, pro|duces the perfection of any kind of government.</P>
<P>And, as a matter of the utmo&s;t moment, let me exhort and be&s;eech all, both officers and &s;oldiers, to conduct in &s;uch a manner as will afford encou|ragement to expect the favourite pre&s;ence of God with us, when we go out to battle.&mdash;If we make the Almighty God our enemy, can we expect to &s;tand before our enemies? Oh! how mon&s;trous to hear &s;oldiers when about to face death, profaning the name of God.&mdash;This is, perhaps a more than in|fernal bravery; for the devils believe there is a God and tremble.&mdash;Shocking intrepidity&mdash;to &s;et their mouths again&s;t the heavens, and challenge Omnipotence it&s;elf.&mdash;And how &s;ordid and &s;hameful for a &s;oldiery to indulge them&s;elves in drunken|ne&s;s, and debauchery? Are the&s;e like to be cham|pions in battle, who are enervated, emaciated and in&s;laved by their lu&s;ts? When Hannibal, the great Carthagenian General, had led an army over the Alps, penetrated Italy it&s;elf, and after &s;undry &s;uc|ce&s;sful battles had given the Romans &s;uch a &s;evere &s;troke at Cannae, that there appeared &s;carce any thing to ob&s;truct his making him&s;elf ma&s;ter of their metropolis, Rome; yet he delayed at Capua, and indulged him&s;elf and &s;oldiers in luxury and drunkenne&s;s, after which, it is &s;aid, his army be|came enervated and di&s;obedient, and he never af|ter was &s;ucce&s;sful in Italy, nor indeed any where el&s;e. This gave occa&s;ion to the proverbial &s;aying, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Capua was to the Carthagenians, what Can|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> been to the Romans; and to that &s;hame|ful

<P>When Bel&s;hazzar and his nobles, with others in Babylon were fea&s;ting and drinking, the city was &s;urprized, taken, and the King &s;lain.</P>
<P>Count it not only your &s;afety but your honour to fear God. It is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> manly fear to re|verence Jehovah, and be afraid of guilt.&mdash;Manly, did I &s;ay? It is angelic, in proportion as the Angels ri&s;e in dignity, they de&s;cend in humble reverence of God. Can you venture to go to the field of battle, in &s;uch a manner, as will not only endan|ger your bodies, but your &s;ouls? Will any le&s;s hardy, as by their open wickedne&s;s, to tell their fellow &s;oldiers and others, that they neither fear God nor man, death nor damnation? Will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> be Achans, In the camp, and thereby damn their own &s;ouls, and de&s;troy their country, by provoking God to deliver us into the hands of our enemies?</P>
<P>But however I thus warn and charge you in re|&s;pect of fearing God, and being afraid of guilt&punc; yet in re&s;pect of your enemies, I would &s;ay, in the words of our text, <HI>be not afraid of them.</HI> We fight not for conque&s;t or fame, with a de&s;ign of cruelly and prodigally &s;hedding human blood&punc; but merely in defence of tho&s;e rights, which be|long to us as men and Britons. Go forth then, and while our invaders boa&s;t of their armour, ar|tillery, di&s;cipline and naval force&punc; let us be en|couraged from the ju&s;tne&s;s of our cau&s;e, and hum|bly confide in the Lord of ho&s;ts; &s;aying "the &s;word of the Lord and of <HI>Liberty.</HI>" Declare upon the one hand, that if you may enjoy unmole&s;ted, tho&s;e rights, which are derived from God alone; you are ready to lay down the arms which you have been con&s;trained, as the la&s;t re&s;ort, to take up&punc;
<PB N="28" REF="042802_0028_101C9508997AC420">
on the other hand, with drawn &s;word, a&s;&s;ert, that rather than &s;urrender that &s;acred depo&s;itum of li|berty, which we received from our ance&s;tors, and are bound to tran&s;mit to our po&s;terity, you will &s;ign the remon&s;trance with your own blood. I &s;hall only add the words of a great General: <HI>Be of good courage, and let us play the men, for our people and the cities of our God; and the Lord do that which &s;eemeth him good.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. You, who are either unfit for bearing arms, or on any other account, may be rea&s;onably ex|empted from going out to battle; yet much (as you have heard) may depend upon you, with re|&s;pect to the &s;ucce&s;s of tho&s;e who appear in the field. And O! how hopeful, if you are engaged in fighting again&s;t your own and others &s;ins which are the cau&s;e why God &s;ends upon us the calamity of war. On the other hand, how di&s;couraging, if many of you, while others are abroad, endea|vouring to cut the bands of &s;lavery, and open a way to liberty with the &s;word, &s;hould, at home, be &s;erving your lu&s;ts and ratifying a league with hell? While others are oppo&s;ing the wrath of our enemies; will any of you venture on &s;uch conduct as will draw down the wrath of God! You may, (as has been &s;aid) be Achans at home and troublers of your country, as well as in the camp. And promi&s;e not your&s;elves &s;ecurity in &s;in, becau&s;e you do not expect to face death in battle. If God be your enemy, he'll find you out and puni&s;h you, though you were hid in the bottom of the &s;ea. You may fall into hell, by the hand of a &s;in-avenging God, at home, while your brethren may &s;tand in battle and return victorious. But O! how hopeful if the aged and females, who are not called to march forth with &s;word and mu&s;ket, &s;hould, while others are marching or fighting, be much in praying. This way they may &s;erve and

help to &s;ave their country, in their hou&s;es and clo&s;ets, as truly as if they were able to appear in the field of battle. Jacob &s;ingly, conquered an enraged enemy, with 400 at his back, not by fight|ing with them, but wre&s;tling with God.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, let me conclude with an addre&s;s, which equally concerns you all, whether you are to go to the field or abide by the &s;tuff. We are at this day treated as guilty of rebellion again&s;t man, ble&s;&s;ed be God this is a fal&s;e charge: But let none of us venture to live under the ju&s;t imputation of a rebellion, far more atrocious in its nature and dreadful in its con&s;equences. I mean an ob&s;ti|nate rebellion again&s;t God, by violating his laws and de&s;pi&s;ing his Go&s;pel. O &s;inners, permit me to u&s;e, with a little variation, language which, ac|cording to its common acceptation, is ju&s;tly hate|ful, but in this ca&s;e proper and emphatical: Let me in re&s;pect of God charge you to non-re&s;i&s;tance, and the mo&s;t unlimited and chearful obedience.&mdash;Lay a&s;ide your armour, confe&s;s your crimes, and &s;ubmit your&s;elves wholly to the mercy of the of|fended King of Heaven and earth. In&s;i&s;t upon no terms of capitulation, but tho&s;e of his own pre|&s;cribing, which are indeed worthy of a God to propo&s;e; &s;alutary and honourable for you to ac|cept. Plead guilty, accept of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, and this merciful King will pa&s;s a &s;entence of oblivion upon your iniquities, and of indem|nity on your per&s;ons. Come inli&s;t under Chri&s;t, and you &s;hall be more than conquerors over your enemies, whether terre&s;trial or infernal. Do you a&s;k what bounty he gives? It is beneath his dig|nity to encourage you with worldly wealth and honour; the&s;e he throws out to &s;laves, even to the devil's &s;oldiers. What think you of pardon&punc; of &s;in, of having the honour to be conformed to him|&s;elf by &s;ufferings in this world, and afterwards
