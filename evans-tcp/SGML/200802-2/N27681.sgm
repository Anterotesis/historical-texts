<Q><HI>For his God doth in&s;truct him to di&s;cretion, and doth teach him.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ALL who acknowledge God to be the Crea|tor of man, and that He commands his birth in the divi&s;ion of the earth he choo&s;es, toge|ther with the peculiar circum&s;tances in which he is placed, will hear our text as the voice of indi&s;|putable truth when addre&s;&s;ed to any individual of mankind. "His God doth in&s;truct him to di&s;|cretion, and teach him:" He affords him both &s;peculative knowledge, and ingenuity to improve it to wi&s;e and u&s;eful ends.</P>
<P>How far <HI>minds</HI> may be equal in an independent &s;tate, is one of tho&s;e ab&s;tru&s;e que&s;tions which <HI>we</HI> have not abilities to a&s;certain.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="036896_0003_100B2E8ABB3CCB80">
But this we know, putting a&s;ide all our own exertions, there are innumerable differences be|tween men&mdash;their ta&s;tes, their di&s;cretion, their capacity of in&s;truction, and their improvements&mdash;which we cannot but think are greatly owing to cau&s;es which we can neither controul nor direct&mdash;to the peculiar formation of our bodies, to the climate where we are born, the circum&s;tances in which we are &s;tationed; to peculiar conjunctures favourable to the di&s;play of our particular abilities. The objects of knowledge and di&s;cretion to which &s;ome are pa&s;&s;ionately attached, and which they learn to comprehend with great ea&s;e, others turn from with indifference and di&s;gu&s;t: in their nature and u&s;e it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible to in&s;truct them, unle&s;s we could communicate to them powers which they have not, or have but in a very feeble degree. Some are born into, and are continued in, &s;ituations which are unfavourable to their in|&s;truction, though their faculties are &s;trong; they are like the diamond in the quarry, which cannot di&s;play its brilliancy for want of light and the poli&s;h of the arti&s;t. Great numbers, no doubt,
<PB N="5" REF="036896_0004_100B2E8D5B7EE120">
of this cla&s;s die in every quarter of the earth, who neither &s;u&s;pect them&s;elves their abilities of emi|nence and u&s;efulne&s;s, nor are e&s;teemed by tho&s;e around them above the rank of ordinary men. Some, though they have been in an indulgent &s;ituation for the acqui&s;ition of knowledge, and the di&s;creet u&s;e of it; and, had they been called to action in circum&s;tances favourable to their u&s;e|fulne&s;s and fame, would have made a con&s;picuous figure in the world, and been di&s;tingui&s;hed ble&s;|&s;ings, have by an uniform &s;eries of events been hindered any &s;triking exhibition of them&s;elves. If the&s;e remarks are ju&s;t, and we feel their force, mu&s;t we not promptly &s;ay, with deep-felt humility, and lively gratitude, that "God doth in&s;truct us to di&s;cretion, and doth teach us," while with vigo|rous zeal we devote our&s;elves to his honour and &s;ervice? Did not He give us our con&s;titution of body, united with the &s;trength of our minds, and the liveline&s;s of our imagination? Has not He ble&s;&s;ed us with the health nece&s;&s;ary to our enjoy|ment, and the &s;ucce&s;sful improvement of our abi|lities? He appoints the place of our birth, either
<PB N="6" REF="036896_0005_100B2E8EDF0E9F60">
in barbarous climes which knowledge never en|lightened, the very air of which enervates the &s;oul; where, if any, there is but a feeble &s;timulus to the exertions which render men great, amiable and good; or in a &s;ituation which fo&s;ters both bodily and mental vigour, and where all cau&s;es con&s;pire to render us the ornaments of human nature, and the ble&s;&s;ings of mankind. He orders "the times and the &s;ea&s;ons," in the exerci&s;e of his &s;overeign wi&s;|dom, &s;o as to bring forward our di&s;cretion and va|rious knowledge in tho&s;e &s;triking attitudes which rai&s;e our reputation and fortune high, and give us a benignant influence upon the worth and hap|pine&s;s of our fellow men; or, continues us in cir|cum&s;tances which doom us to concealment and inaction, while we are con&s;cious of tho&s;e excellent powers which, indulged, would greatly benefit our country, and gloriou&s;ly di&s;tingui&s;h our&s;elves.</P>
<P>Nor may we conclude, as we &s;hall be apt to do if we think but &s;uperficially upon this &s;ubject, that, becau&s;e we are ultimately indebted to God for our di&s;cretion and mental improvement, it is therefore wholly unnece&s;&s;ary we &s;hould labour to acquire
<PB N="7" REF="036896_0006_100B2E9096787CB8">
them by the exerci&s;e of the original powers He gave us, which grow with our growth, and render us capable of increa&s;ing judgment and knowledge: For He&mdash;and certainly He has a right to convey his unde&s;erved ble&s;&s;ings to his creatures in the mode He choo&s;es&mdash;has &s;een fit in&s;eparably to con|nect the&s;e together. God has &s;een fit to command us "to lift up our voices for under&s;tanding, and &s;earch for wi&s;dom as for hidden trea&s;ure," whom we are &s;acredly bound to obey, by the principles of duty, and the motives of honour and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Having made the&s;e ob&s;ervations, always impor|tant, I &s;hall now lead you to a con&s;ideration of &s;everal ways in which the ALL-WISE AND BENE|FICENT BEING, who rules over all, "in&s;tructs men to di&s;cretion," and teaches them how to in|crea&s;e the &s;ecurity and welfare of the &s;ocieties to which they belong, and the individuals with whom they are intimately connected, and to &s;ecure and promote their future happine&s;s as accountable be|ings. I &s;hall conclude with &s;everal practical reflec|tions upon the effects which the liberal di&s;tribution of His invaluable gifts in our NATION &s;hould have
<PB N="8" REF="036896_0007_100B2E95023381D0">
upon our minds, affections and actions. Nor &s;hall I fail to make honourable mention of the Great and Good Man who has lately "fallen in our I&s;rael, and for whom the whole land &s;o &s;incerely mourns."</P>
<P>We con&s;ider, then&mdash;</P>
<P>I. Several ways in which the ALL-WISE AND BENEFICENT BEING, who rules over all, "in&s;tructs men to di&s;cretion, and teaches them" how to in|crea&s;e the &s;ecurity and welfare of the &s;ocieties to which they belong, and the individuals with whom they are intimately connected; to &s;ecure and pro|mote their future happine&s;s as accountable beings.</P>
<P>FIRST. Our text is &s;poken by the prophet of the Farmer; and therefore AGRICULTURE will claim our attention before any other kind of in|&s;truction which God has given our race. By agri|culture in a large &s;en&s;e is meant a judicious method of preparing the earth for the reception of &s;eeds, and dre&s;&s;ing the fruits &s;he yields &s;o as to be fit for the food and nouri&s;hment of man. This was, after man became ignorant and barbarous in any of tho&s;e abodes to which he wandered from the &s;tate of civilized knowledge, however familiar the bu&s;i|ne&s;s
<PB N="9" REF="036896_0008_100B2E97716CADF0">
may have become to us, who have by long experience been better in&s;tructed, e&s;teemed the mo&s;t u&s;eful art of which he could be made ma&s;ter. In the mere &s;avage &s;tate we &s;hould be in frequent want of the nece&s;&s;aries of life; we &s;hould be obli|ged to &s;eek a precarious and unplentiful &s;ub&s;i&s;tence with ince&s;&s;ant labour; and ofttimes would our mo&s;t painful &s;earches be wholly in vain: we &s;hould e&s;teem him, therefore, in this &s;tate of morti|fication and want, the mo&s;t eminent of our num|ber, and hail him our fir&s;t benefactor, who &s;hould teach us the di&s;cretion nece&s;&s;ary to cultivate the &s;oil, and cau&s;e it to yield a &s;ufficiency of food to &s;atisfy the cravings of hunger, and invigorate our bodies.</P>
<P>In the &s;hort hi&s;tory we have of our fir&s;t parent there are expre&s;&s;ions which admit not of an ea&s;y ex|planation, unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e he was peculiarly taught of God this mo&s;t u&s;eful art. Before his creation, it is there &s;aid, "there was not a man to <HI>till</HI> the ground." But, uninformed either by ob|&s;ervation of other men, or by his own experience, how to perform this important work, whence
<PB N="10" REF="036896_0009_100B2E995AFB4D88">
could he derive his knowledge but from his Maker? After his creation, we are told al&s;o, "the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dre&s;s it, and to keep it." This knowledge he no doubt communicated to his immediate de|&s;cendants, and they to theirs. Yet &s;ome of his chil|dren, in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ages &s;ince his day, have through misfortune and di&s;tre&s;s &s;unk into the pure &s;tate of ignorance and barbarity, and lo&s;t, almo&s;t entirely, this beneficial art. The wi&s;e and good, who have entered among&s;t tribes of men in &s;o de|graded and afflictive a condition, have taught them agriculture, as a mo&s;t efficient means of their civi|lization, and of increa&s;e to the comforts of their lives, as tenants of the earth. Duly appreciating the benefit, they have e&s;teemed them&s;elves under &s;uch immen&s;e obligations of reverence and grati|tude to them for their le&s;&s;ons, and the happy alte|ration they have made in their modes of life, that they have hailed them divine per&s;ons, who have vi&s;ited the earth for their good. They have con&s;e|crated their memory with religious honours, though they were in reality only men better taught than
<PB N="11" REF="036896_0010_100B2E9C343F9858">
them&s;elves by God, who alone de&s;erves adoration. Agriculture indeed ought ever to rank in our minds as a mo&s;t valuable &s;pecies of knowledge communi|cated to us by the Father of our &s;pirits. Under her benignant influence "the wilderne&s;s becomes a fruitful field, and the de&s;ert blo&s;&s;oms as the ro&s;e;" man lives without con&s;tant dread of want, and is far more agreeably fed and clothed; his body and his mind both are plea&s;ingly and honourably employed in obedience to her direction; and in a way which tends powerfully to the common and univer&s;al good of his race with whom he has any communication.</P>
<P>SECOND. Military di&s;cretion &s;eems, in the cour&s;e of things, to have been taught men by their Divine In&s;tructor, next to the knowledge how, pro|fitably, to cultivate the earth. Univer&s;al hi&s;tory proves whereever tribes of men have by their know|ledge and indu&s;try acquired a fruitful inheritance, there have been other tribes around, who, either from the motives of ambition and power or the de&s;ire of more plentiful accommodation, have at|tempted, when artful mea&s;ures have failed of the
<PB N="12" REF="036896_0011_100B2E9F35F74EC0">
end, to gain the dominion over them by violence. We may exclaim, Alas! why do men increa&s;e the mi&s;eries of their pre&s;ent exi&s;tence by the har&s;h ca|lamities of war, when evil enough are our days without them? Why do they &s;horten each others' lives, when they will quickly go down to the grave, though they have nothing &s;ingular to ha&s;ten them? We may pray, and we ought to pray with fer|vency, that the ju&s;t, the mild, the benevolent re|ligion of Chri&s;t may prevail, aud men learn war no more. We may join our rea&s;onings and ad|vices to &s;ucceed its complete influence; and we ought to do it, becau&s;e no order of things would more advance the tranquillity and happine&s;s of mankind. But &s;till God hath given us abilities to learn the regular proce&s;&s;es, aud the various &s;tra|tagems, of attack and defence: "He hath taught our hands to war, and our fingers to fight." The cour&s;e of the Divine Providence &s;eems al&s;o to prove, that we mu&s;t make u&s;e with &s;pirit of the ar|mour which is given us, in every ju&s;t and honour|able method, during the continuance of the pre&s;ent corruption of human nature, until it is e&s;&s;entially
<PB N="13" REF="036896_0012_100B2EA2D485BD08">
altered for the better, unle&s;s we are willing to be oppre&s;&s;ed, to be &s;laves, and mi&s;erable. Hence we find, that upon nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ions men in ge|neral are ea&s;ily rou&s;ed to war, and &s;oon learn to perform its duties, as well as bear its hard&s;hips. Nor doth the Wi&s;e and Beneficent Being, who rules over all, and tenderly regards his injured creatures, fail to rai&s;e up for them on &s;uch emer|gences intelligent commanders, and celebrated generals, to guide and direct them.</P>
<P>THIRD. After men have taken up their abode together in a &s;ituation which they have cho&s;en, enjoy a fair and good inheritance, and are able to defend them&s;elves in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;till they need intere&s;ting in&s;truction from God, their great Teacher. If they are at all worthy their lot, they will wi&s;h to be acquainted with con&s;titutions of civil government favourable to their freedom and happine&s;s; and with the peculiar motives which, placed before the minds and pa&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e rai&s;ed to their admini&s;tration, &s;hall render them content with their legitimate reverence, honours, and &s;upport, while with unremitted fidelity they
<PB N="14" REF="036896_0013_100B2EA535806558">
exert them&s;elves for the public &s;afety and happi|ne&s;s. With exten&s;ive, beautiful and luxuriant territory, with numbers and martial &s;kill equal to their defence and aggrandizement, while alone, they may yet mourn the choice&s;t ble&s;&s;ings of &s;oci|ety. But, when to the&s;e are added well-cho&s;en and equal governments, carried into effect by well-improved, ju&s;t and patriotic men, they then have as much &s;ecurity and enjoyment as public bodies of men can have in this &s;tate of imperfection. Yea, wi&s;e and equal government, with intelligent, faith|ful and kind rulers, &s;oftens the har&s;he&s;t climates, fructifies barren &s;oils, in&s;pires man with the love of country, and cau&s;es him to rejoice in circum&s;tances naturally calculated to di&s;pirit him, and render him habitually unhappy.</P>
<P>The knowledge which produces this admirable order is &s;low in its growth, and &s;paringly diffu&s;ed among&s;t the inhabitants of the earth; owing either to indi&s;po&s;ition on the &s;ide of tho&s;e in power, or to the nece&s;&s;ity and indolence of their &s;ubjects. Until within a &s;hort period of time a well-balanced government has not been contemplated by the
<PB N="15" REF="036896_0014_100B2EA6F6E8C340">
human mind, like other objects which are inti|mately connected with the improvement and feli|city of man. The governments which illu&s;trate this idea are rare, amid&s;t the innumerable ones which would be made u&s;e of to &s;how, in a pointed view, how va&s;tly important to the dignity and hap|pine&s;s of mankind that it &s;hould be univer&s;ally realized, in the authorities which govern them.</P>
<P>There is perhaps in all civilized countries, ble&s;t with the means of good education, a &s;ufficient number of wi&s;e and faithful men, who, invited from their retirement, and patronized, would produce forms of government in theory excellent, and which, in operation, would yield them quietude and freedom, order and pro&s;perity. If they are not brought forth to this good work, through the influence of cau&s;es &s;o commanding that it would be imprudence and madne&s;s to counteract them, the evil mu&s;t be borne with re&s;ignation, as an evil which the Supreme Ruler ordains or permits, in abatement of their worth and felicity. But if this failure is owing to their neg|ligence, and unworthy attachment to their in|dividual
<PB N="16" REF="036896_0015_100B2EA940943180">
intere&s;ts, or the intere&s;t of any particular order to which they belong, all they lo&s;e and &s;uffer mu&s;t be charged to a degree of criminality which de&s;erves his rebuke and cha&s;ti&s;ement.</P>
<P>FOURTH. COMMERCE and the ARTS are cheerfully embraced and improved by individuals and nations in &s;ituations which are favourable to their acqui&s;ition and growth. Commerce they prize a fruitful &s;ource of private and national wealth, which they dearly love for the di&s;tinction, &s;plendour and varied enjoyments it &s;o liberally confers. The arts increa&s;e their nece&s;&s;aries and conveniences, and greatly embelli&s;h human life; they are therefore objects of their &s;trong de&s;ires. And who, that pa&s;&s;es over the chart of the world with attention, but will be convinced that, where-ever the Father and Benefactor of men has allotted them habitations indulgent to commerce and the arts, he has given them, though in different de|grees, di&s;cretion and &s;pirit to gain and advantage|ou&s;ly exert them&s;elves in their improvement?</P>
<P>FIFTH. Nations, in proportion as they be|come civilized, and engage in the profitable and
<PB N="17" REF="036896_0016_100B2EAC4C6B7180">
ornamental bu&s;ine&s;&s;es of life, e&s;teem the means of a good and u&s;eful, a more improved and liberal education among&s;t the important ble&s;&s;ings which their God confers upon them. As the &s;tages of &s;ociety advance, we find we are not accompli&s;hed for our condition, unle&s;s we have the knowledge of language and figures. Without the&s;e, we may have plea&s;ing per&s;ons, agreeable qualities, and &s;ound under&s;tanding; and yet &s;hall be compara|tively de&s;pi&s;ed. We cannot, though every thing el&s;e &s;hould favour us, ri&s;e beyond very lowly cir|cum&s;tances. Yet a young man, who is only ma&s;ter of the&s;e branches of knowledge, and yet ri&s;|es to ea&s;y circum&s;tances; who has mental indu&s;try, and has ardent wi&s;hes to know all that the mo&s;t enlightened men know, may ri&s;e to their &s;tate of in|tellectual improvement. Such examples, however, are very uncommon. Nations well in&s;tructed therefore in the be&s;t-appointed means of public and private knowledge, connected with individual reputation and enjoyment, as well as the general &s;ecurity and welfare, have made ample provi&s;ion
<PB N="18" REF="036896_0017_100B2EADCFBCF610">
for the higher grades of education, which tho&s;e may improve who have inclination and ta&s;te.</P>
<P>SIXTH. God has taught his children of man|kind the divine and moral knowledge they po&s;&s;e&s;s, which tends to the purification of their hearts, and their progre&s;s in virtue; which ble&s;&s;es them, whenever it has its &s;uitable effect upon them, with peace and joy in this &s;tate, and prepares them for higher felicity in future &s;cenes of exi&s;tence. This he has done in &s;undry ways, and in different proportions, as has &s;eemed be&s;t to his un&s;earchable under&s;tanding. Some he has in&s;tructed in the&s;e important truths only by their rea&s;on, con&s;cience, and moral feelings, aided by the labours of philo&s;ophers. Holy men, righteous patriarchs, and in&s;pired prophets, have been his teachers to a different divi&s;ion of the human race; while others, in which number we are, through his di&s;cri|minating bounty, are more highly illuminated by Je&s;us, the Great Light of the moral world. The de&s;ign of this varied in&s;truction is to encourage us to virtue as our highe&s;t health and happine&s;s, to excite within us an expectation, notwith&s;tand|ing
<PB N="19" REF="036896_0018_100B2EB010B20858">
we mu&s;t peri&s;h here, yet that we &s;hall live for|ever hereafter in a &s;tate of ju&s;t retribution; an ex|pectation which communicates &s;uperior vigour to the motives of virtue, and the di&s;&s;ua&s;ives from vice. However incompetent we may be to judge why; however firm our conviction that the Judge of all the earth can be neither unju&s;t nor cruel; yet we mu&s;t acknowledge the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t are far better taught in religion and virtue than the re&s;t of their fellow-creatures have been, or are now; have more powerful motives and a&s;&s;i&s;|tances to well doing; have a future &s;tate of reward and puni&s;hment placed before them in a much clearer, more &s;plendid and more influential light.</P>
<P>Thus I have con&s;idered mankind "in&s;tructed to di&s;cretion, and taught" by their God, in &s;everal views which are calculated to in&s;pire us with the livelie&s;t &s;entiments of gratitude and love to Him for his goodne&s;s, and to engage us to &s;erve Him with con&s;tant fidelity. I proceed, as was pro|po&s;ed in the &s;econd place&mdash;</P>
<P>II. To &s;everal practical reflections upon the influence which the liberal di&s;tribution God has
<PB N="20" REF="036896_0019_100B2EB28100CE30">
made in our nation of his invaluable gifts, &s;hould have upon our minds, affections, and manners.</P>
<P>FIRST. When we con&s;ider the degree of knowledge of our national intere&s;ts, and di&s;po&s;i|tion well to improve it, which God has kindly communicated to us&mdash;&s;hould we not addre&s;s him with unfeigned thank&s;giving and prai&s;e?</P>
<P>Agriculture, commerce, military and naval &s;cience, accompanied with rapidly-increa&s;ing num|bers of hardy &s;ons; a ju&s;t and enlarged acquain|tance with civil obligations and rights, and there|fore of the line which forever di&s;tingui&s;hes liberty from licentiou&s;ne&s;s; con&s;titutions of government which are the genuine offspring of &s;uch knowledge, admini&s;tred by men of our own election, and removeable at our choice, whenever they betray their tru&s;t; advantages of education, ri&s;ing gradually from the lowe&s;t to the highe&s;t form; a religion pure and beneficent, which frowns upon vice, and encourages piety and virtue with tho&s;e alarming con&s;iderations which tend to render us good citizens of particular &s;ocieties here, and of the great &s;ociety hereafter formed out of
<PB N="21" REF="036896_0020_100B2EB5CAA3DC98">
"every nation, kingdom, and tongue;"&mdash;The&s;e, the&s;e are now operative cau&s;es, in the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, which will, unle&s;s we ba&s;ely counteract them, render us a virtuous and happy, a great and powerful nation. Often &s;hould we meditate upon the&s;e rich and unde&s;erved ble&s;|&s;ings of the Divine Providence and Grace, and, whenever we do, we &s;hould &s;ay, with exulting and grateful &s;pirits, "Ble&s;s the Lord, O our &s;ouls, and let his prai&s;e be continually upon our lips."</P>
<P>SECOND. We ought ever to remember with honour and affectionate gratitude tho&s;e who, though now removed from this world by the wi&s;e providence of God, yet have pa&s;&s;ed through life "in&s;tructed to di&s;cretion, and taught by Him," and have uniformly exerted their abilities for the &s;afety and pro&s;perity of their country.</P>
<P>Be this, our hearts immediately rejoin, thy prai&s;e, O WASHINGTON! The grave now &s;hrouds thee from our &s;ight! No more &s;halt thou be in|&s;trumental on earth in doing us good! But we will &s;till draw thee up before us by the aid of ima|gination; we will behold thee with increa&s;ing &s;a|tisfaction

and delight: never will we behold thee, but we will prai&s;e thee?</P>
<P>General WASHINGTON was truly a great and good man. While hi&s;tory records the truth, his character will ever &s;tand &s;uper-eminently high; and in every country where her pages are read he will be e&s;teemed and admired. But the view of him, which mu&s;t mo&s;t endear him to us, is that of the Father of this People, their con&s;tantly active and powerful friend, both in the quietude of retire|ment, and amid&s;t the threatening evils of war. Though, at home, independent in his circum|&s;tances, happy in his family, re&s;pected and loved by all around him, yet, whenever called upon by his country, he has cheerfully re&s;igned ea&s;e, and en|joyments which were dear to him, and devoted him&s;elf to her intere&s;ts. Call after call he has ne|ver di&s;obeyed. His fortitude has borne him through hard&s;hips oftentimes very &s;evere. He al|ways exerted his good &s;en&s;e, his amiable qualities, his military &s;kill and bravery, to render his nation independent and pro&s;perous. He was a great farmer, he was a friend to commerce and the arts,
<PB N="23" REF="036896_0022_100B2EB9F6F08F58">
a friend to u&s;eful education and literature, a friend to chri&s;tianity; to the purity of heart and excel|lent manners which &s;he enjoins&mdash;<HI>The Man</HI> pre|de&s;tined in the coun&s;els of God, which take in all ages, from the beginning of time, until time &s;hall be no more, to be at the head of the new empire in the new world: an empire which cannot fail to ri&s;e to great celebrity while its rulers and people continue to follow his wi&s;e and good example. He died with the &s;ame greatne&s;s he had lived. We are told, by an authority which we cannot di&s;pute, "His la&s;t &s;cene corre&s;ponded with the whole tenour of his life. Not a groan, not a com|plaint, e&s;caped him, though in extreme di&s;tre&s;s. With perfect re&s;ignation, and a full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his rea&s;on, he clo&s;ed his well &s;pent life." Yet, no doubt, with fervent prayer, at this awful &s;ea&s;on, with more fervency than he ever before experienced, he failed not to entreat the forgivene&s;s and mercy of his God&mdash;and added &s;till&mdash;O Great Protector of men, and Friend of human happine&s;s, continue to pre&s;erve and ble&s;s my country! Shall we ever forget affectionately to remember and prai&s;e this

man? No&mdash;each one of us &s;hould reply for him|&s;elf&mdash;"If I forget thee, let my right hand forget her cunning. If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth."</P>
<P>THIRD. Could this great and good per&s;on au|dibly addre&s;s our nation, a&s;&s;embled in the act of mourning for his departure, would he not thus ad|dre&s;s us?&mdash;My countrymen and friends! I more delight in your freedom, &s;tability and happine&s;s, than in any thing human! The fabled pulpits&mdash;the mourning bells&mdash;the &s;low-&s;ounding artillery&mdash;the &s;ad countenance &s;o univer&s;ally &s;pread among&s;t you in con&s;equence of my death, I e&s;teem high te&s;timonials of your re&s;pect and affection for me. But the be&s;t and mo&s;t &s;incere re&s;pect ye can pay my memory is, the trea&s;uring up my advices in your hearts, joined with obedience to them in your lives. <HI>Let no arts per&s;uade you to loo&s;en your</HI> UNION. <HI>Treat all other nations with ju&s;tice and kindne&s;s; but impre&s;&s;ively remember, this is your nation, and &s;acrifice not her intere&s;ts from predilection to any other. Be eco|nomical, indu&s;trious, punctual. Take care that the fear of God, and tho&s;e works of righteou&s;ne&s;s, are a|mong&s;t

you, the fruits of which "are peace, quietne&s;s and a&s;&s;urance forever.</HI>" Can we hearken to more &s;alutary advice? Can we more properly te&s;tify our e&s;teem and love for our departed Chief, than by &s;teady obedience to his excellent coun&s;els?</P>
<P>FOURTH. If we improve with fidelity the know|ledge and advantages we enjoy, we may firmly hope we &s;hall never want &s;tate&s;men and military commanders "in&s;tructed by their God to di&s;cre|tion, and taught" how to defend us in time of danger, and lead us on to continued &s;afety and pro&s;perity. From the PRESIDENCY through the various important departments of GOVERNMENT we have per&s;ons of approved talents and integrity to rule over us, at the pre&s;ent time. Who will que&s;tion the &s;kill and bravery of our Land and Sea Officers whenever they &s;hall be called into action? "Our Fathers have told us" upon how many oc|ca&s;ions God appeared for their deliverance when there was &s;een before them no human re&s;ource of &s;afety. His loving kindne&s;s and tender mercies have repeatedly been di&s;played towards this people during our own experience. Why then &s;hould we mi&s;tru&s;t his continued protection and ble&s;&s;ing?
<PB N="26" REF="036896_0025_100B2EC10F8A8400">
No doubt He will continue our friend and bounti|ful benefactor, until we ba&s;ely for&s;ake our duty and our happine&s;s.&mdash;I conclude.</P>
<P>My conclu&s;ion will be in honour of JESUS CHRIST. He was the Wi&s;dom of God in the mo&s;t emphatical &s;en&s;e of the terms. For our &s;akes he left the highe&s;t honours of heaven; "he became a man of &s;orrows, and acquainted with grief; &s;trick|en, &s;mitten of God, and afflicted," that he might enlighten, purify and &s;ave us. We ought there|fore to venerate, love and obey him with far more reverence, affection and zeal than we do any other in&s;tructor and friend in our form. The MEMORI|AL of his death and benefits &s;ome of us are &s;oon to enter upon. I pray God there may &s;oon be a lar|ger number to "do this in remembrance of him."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was Communion Day.</NOTE> His religion affords us the highe&s;t con&s;olation and joy upon &s;uch in&s;tances of mortality as we are this day peculiarly called to mourn. With re&s;pect to him&s;elf he &s;ays, "Therefore doth my Father love me, becau&s;e I lay down my life that I might take it again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my&s;elf: I have power to lay it down, and
<PB N="27" REF="036896_0026_100B2EC29AFEC828">
I have power to take it again. This command|ment have I received of my Father." With re&s;pect to his followers he &s;ays, "I am the Re&s;urrection and the Life;" and a&s;&s;ures us, all the ju&s;t &s;hall be rai&s;ed incorruptible and immortal. When his di&s;|ciples began to degenerate, and grow le&s;s mindful of his in&s;tructions, he commanded his beloved John thus to addre&s;s the churches: "I heard a voice from heaven &s;aying unto me, Write, Ble&s;&s;ed are the dead which die in the Lord, from henceforth: yea, &s;aith the Spirit, that they may re&s;t from their la|bours; and their works do follow them."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"There was &s;olemn Mu&s;ic adapted to the&s;e words after the Sermon.</NOTE> May the&s;e a&s;&s;urances rejoice our hearts when we con|template the wi&s;e, the good, and the great, under the dominion of death: may they engage us all, in our &s;everal characters and relations, to act a wi&s;e, good and chri&s;tian part here, that we may hereafter, in our &s;everal mea&s;ures, partake with them in their joys, through the mercy of God in Him who lov|ed us, and died for us.</P>
