<HEAD>A Funeral Di&s;cour&s;e, ON THE DEATH OF GENERAL WASHINGTON.</HEAD>
<P>OBEDIENT to the voice of Providence, with millions of our fellow citizens, throughout the&s;e United States, we a&s;|&s;emble this day, with &s;ympathizing hearts. In|vited al&s;o, to this duty, by the &s;upreme authori|ty of the nation, we come to pay a merited tri|bute of re&s;pect to the memory of the man, who loved our nation, and who, under GOD, built us up, as a people.</P>
<P>Let me invite your &s;olemn thoughts to what the mournful occa&s;ion &s;ugge&s;ts; taking for our guide, a &s;entence of that pathetic and beautiful Elegy on the death of Saul and Jonathan,</P>
<Q><BIBL>ii Samuel, I, xix.</BIBL>
HOW ARE THE MIGHTY FALLEN!</Q>
<P>WASHINGTON, the great and good; the pride of America, and the ornament of human nature; WASHINGTON, the &s;courge of ty|rants, the defender of the oppre&s;&s;ed, the found|er
<PB N="6" REF="037866_0005_100F5A6775423378">
of an empire, and the father of his country, has fallen by the all conquering arm of death!</P>
<P>When our country was invaded by a great and powerful nation, and we were threatened with the lo&s;s of the rights of freemen; by a concurrence of Providences, Heaven de&s;ignated him, to be the guide of our councils and the lead|er of the American Armies. He taught us to &s;tand fa&s;t in defence of the liberties, in which GOD had made us free. In this re&s;pect, we may ob&s;erve a &s;imilitude, between the conductor of the Armies of I&s;rael and of our own; with this difference, that while Saul was given, as a rod of cha&s;tizement to an ungrateful and &s;inning people, GOD gave WASHINGTON as a ble&s;&s;ing to America.</P>
<P>The character of our Illu&s;trious General would &s;uffer degradation by a compari&s;on with an oppre&s;&s;ive and ferocious Saul, or any other ancient and celebrated heroes and conquerers. In one circum&s;tance of their life there is a re|&s;emblance, they were both valient defenders of their country.</P>
<P>In other re&s;pects their lives, characters and death, were a contra&s;t. Saul, beatten by his enemies, and hated by his &s;ubjects; fell, in de|&s;pair, on his own &s;word, on Mount Gilboa: WASHINGTON, victorious over all the enemies of his country, univer&s;ally honored and loved, with peace of con&s;cience and hope in GOD, dropped calmly into the arms of death, on Mount Vernon. Death brings to a period, the active life of the mightie&s;t of the &s;ons of men.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="037866_0006_100F5A4A45E85440">
It is a duty to be deeply affected at the death of tho&s;e, whom GOD has honored to be in&s;truments of great good to mankind. And one great rea|&s;on and motive, is, that the number of &s;uch men in the world, is comparatively &s;mall. While univer&s;al depravity, prompts men to indulge a &s;pirit of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, pride, oppre&s;&s;ion and vio|lence; how few among the multitude do we find, who are actuated by the divine benevolence, which inclines not to &s;eek their own, but the happine&s;s of others? To hazard health and life, and renounce dome&s;tic ea&s;e and happine&s;s, and to &s;pend their be&s;t thoughts and their wealth, to &s;ecure and advance the happine&s;s of mankind? Good men &s;tudy to be u&s;eful. We love and ad|mire &s;uch generous and di&s;intere&s;ted benefactors. When &s;uch men are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of wealth and ex|alted to power, they are indeed mini&s;ters of GOD for good. They are the protection of the help|le&s;s, and a hiding place to the oppre&s;&s;ed.&mdash;"They break the rod of the wicked, and give deliverance to them that are bound. When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice." When &s;uch men are removed by death, pious &s;ouls will mourn. They will fear the out|breakings of tho&s;e vices and di&s;orders in the community, which the example and authority of great and good men, re&s;trained and held in. It was at a time when men of this character were taken away, that the royal p&s;almi&s;t, in earne&s;t prayer, called upon GOD; &s;aying, "Help LORD for the godly man cea&s;eth, for the faithful fail from among the children of men." The death of &s;uch per&s;ons, is &s;till more, a cau&s;e
<PB N="8" REF="037866_0007_100F5A6A92114650">
of &s;orrow and deep humiliation, as it is a frown of Heaven. "The righteous are taken away from the evil to come;" and &s;afely hou&s;ed in Heaven, before the &s;torms of judgment and de&s;|olation are poured out, upon a guilty nation.</P>
<P>As dutiful children mourn the death of wi&s;e and affectionate parents, on whom they depended for earthly comforts, &s;o we, in duty bound, &s;or|row at the death of great and worthy characters, who&s;e lives have been &s;pent in the &s;ervice of mankind. It was at the tomb of one of this de&s;cription, that the Savior of the world, gave vent to &s;orrow, by flowing tears.</P>
<P>Righteous men by their piety and their works, pre&s;erve the world from judgments. The ho|ly GOD re&s;trains the vials of his wrath, for their &s;ake. They are the &s;alt of the earth. De|&s;truction could not come upon the impious cit|ies of the plain, until righteous Lot was remo|ved beyond the reach of the &s;torm. I&s;rael was ble&s;&s;ed for Abraham's piety; and the hou&s;e of Potipher, yea, the kingdom of Egypt were pro&s;pered and &s;aved, becau&s;e the virtuous and godlike Jo&s;eph dwelt there. The wi&s;e and good man, who by his wi&s;dom delivers a city, from the de&s;truction of its enemies, is forgotten by its thoughtle&s;s and ungrateful inhabitants; but the people of the&s;e redeemed States will never for|get its noble defenders, who have poured out their blood, and &s;acrificed their lives in their de|fence. And may our &s;upreme gratitude centre in the goodne&s;s of the Almighty Jehovah, who gives &s;uch men to ble&s;s and to &s;ave us.</P>
<P>A reflection on the wonderful increa&s;e and
<PB N="9" REF="037866_0008_100F5A4F091BE8C0">
pro&s;perity of the&s;e New England States, from their feeble beginning, in the uncommon &s;miles of Heaven upon them, will con&s;train us to ac|knowledge, that GOD hath &s;hewed mercy to the children, on account of the piety of their an|ce&s;tors.</P>
<P>They fled from per&s;ecution, with the pure and laudable purpo&s;e of maintaining the know|ledge and wor&s;hip of the true GOD, and the &s;implicity and purity of the religion of JESUS; and to tran&s;mit the ble&s;&s;ings of civil and reli|gious liberty to future generations.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t landing of the fathers of New Eng|land at Plymouth, an hundred and eighty years ago, with pious gratitude to their memories, is &s;till commemorated, in an anniver&s;ary fe&s;tival, by the inhabitants of that ancient town.</P>
<LG>
<L>"Long to&s;s'd by tempe&s;ts, to this promi&s;ed land,</L>
<L>Heaven led &s;ecure the patriarchal band;</L>
<L>Worn by fatigue, by famine and di&s;ea&s;e,</L>
<L>The &s;treams lock'd up in ice, and bare the trees,</L>
<L>No fi&s;h nor fruit, and on the &s;nowy plain,</L>
<L>Untill'd, no promi&s;e of the future grain:</L>
<L>While round their fires, they heard fierce panthers growl,</L>
<L>Their babes were frightned by the Indian howl:</L>
<L>Still undi&s;may'd intent on Heaven's de&s;ign,</L>
<L>And full of hopes began a nation's line."</L>

<P>It is a duty to celebrate the worthy charac|ters of departed benefactors of our country, becau&s;e we enjoy the happy fruits of their good deeds, and becau&s;e the example will excite the
<PB N="10" REF="037866_0009_100F28818D3948D0">
laudable emulation of others, to imitate their noble actions. The approbation of the wi&s;e and worthy, is a &s;ource of happine&s;s next to that of our own con&s;cience. While the re|membrance of the wicked rots in the grave, the memorial of the righteous lives, in the grateful hearts of &s;ucceeding generations.</P>
<P>Every nation celebrates &s;ome noble patriots and benefactors, to whom, under Providence, they attribute their pro&s;perity. They embalm their memories in grateful &s;ongs, and in the faithful page of hi&s;tory. While Britain cele|brates her Alfreds, Edwards, Hamdens, Sidneys and Pitts&mdash;Ru&s;&s;ia, her Peter the great&mdash;France, her Henrys&mdash;Switzerland, her William Tells&mdash;and Holland, the family of Orange&mdash;and the Prote&s;tants of Chri&s;tendom, their Luther and Calvin, Melancthon and Zuingleus. Wickliff, Knox and Robin&s;on.&mdash;America will ever re|member her WASHINGTON, who, among the con&s;tellation of worthies which have, at differ|ent periods ble&s;&s;ed their country, &s;hines as a &s;tar of &s;uperior orb, and will &s;hed the happy radi|ence of his virtues, to unborn generations. It is not po&s;&s;ible for human eloquence to do ju&s;tice to the character of this great man. There was &s;omething in the maje&s;tic ca&s;t of his coun|tenance, which the mo&s;t &s;kilful limner, could not with preci&s;ion and exactitude delineate on can|vas; and in him was &s;uch a noblene&s;s and eleva|tion of mind, above the common lot of human|ity, as baffles the powers of de&s;cription.</P>
<P>De&s;cended of re&s;pectable ance&s;tors, who came from Britain to Virginia, at an early period of
<PB N="11" REF="037866_0010_100F5A514F51BCD8">
the &s;ettlement of that State; on the decea&s;e of an elder brother, he came into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the patrimonial e&s;tate of Mount Vernon. In early life he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the mature wi&s;dom of age; and was called when a &s;tripling, to lead a band of warriors, again&s;t a ho&s;t of French and Savages, which like a dreadful &s;torm, lay upon the defencele&s;s frontiers. His prudence, valour and wi&s;dom, &s;aved the remains of the unfortu|nate army under Braddock, and covered their retreat from the bloody field.</P>
<P>When Britain prepared chains, to fetter the free born minds of the Americans, as the French once, in vain attempted to do; he &s;tepped forth, the fir&s;t among her worthy &s;ons, to defend his country. When &s;ufferings could no longer be borne, and the blood of Americans wontonly &s;hed by Britons, rou&s;ed our country to arms; the fir&s;t illu&s;trious Areopagus, and Congre&s;s of our nation, looked up to WASHINGTON, as the man, on whom, under GOD, they re&s;ted their dependence, for the protection of their country. Obedient to their voice, he came forward to the &s;eat of the enemy, and &s;oon, by his &s;uperior wi&s;dom, an undi&s;ciplined multitude were formed to regularity and order.</P>
<P>Be&s;ieging the enemy, through a long winter, in their &s;trong hold in Bo&s;ton, of which they had gotten the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion under the ma&s;k of friends, by a bloodle&s;s victory, he forced their veteran armies and fleets, though commanded by their able&s;t officers, with precipitation and di&s;grace, to abandon the place.</P>
<P>He ob&s;erved their movements with vigilant
<PB N="12" REF="037866_0011_100F5A6E62BDC4B0">
attention; and when the enemy arrived at Long I&s;land, and New York, he was there, &s;topping the progre&s;s of their de&s;olating and murdering career. For a time, GOD &s;uffered the enemy to pro&s;per, and the time of the en|li&s;tments of the army having expired, our worthy general found him&s;elf almo&s;t alone in the field. With a handful of brave men, de|termined to &s;hare the fate of their beloved chief, he prudently retreated through the Jer&s;ies, be|fore the face of a ho&s;t of foes. Never did WASHINGTON appear greater than in &s;ea&s;ons of the greate&s;t perplexity and danger. In his own &s;uperior genius he found re&s;ources. When the enemy boa&s;ted that they had him in their power, and had won the day: when they were erecting royal &s;tandards, and i&s;&s;uing proclama|tions of pardon, behold, WASHINGTON &s;ud|denly appears, like the fun breaking from a dark cloud. And though the elements &s;eemed to con&s;pire with his foes, yet relying on Almighty Providence, and the ju&s;tice of the cau&s;e, in the cold and dreary night of chri&s;tmas, he cro&s;&s;ed the Deleware, and came like a clap of thunder upon the enemy, &s;ecure of &s;afety in the villages of Trenton. GOD in&s;pired him with pre&s;ence of mind, and invincible fortitude, and he pur&s;ued his victories, and conquered, like Gideon, nu|merous ho&s;ts, with an handful of men.</P>
<P>To deceive the enemy, at midnight, he left his camp and fires burning at Trenton, and the enemy preparing to fall upon him, and cru&s;h him, on the following morning. How great was their a&s;toni&s;hment, when the roar of
<PB N="13" REF="037866_0012_100F5A52F80268D0">
cannon, many miles in the north, fir&s;t gave them intelligence where he was, and where he al&s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully broke up another powerful can|tonment. And in the mid&s;t of enemies, who were &s;pread like gra&s;shoppers over the plains of Jer&s;ey, he retired to a &s;trong hold, and re|mained unmole&s;ted.</P>
<P>After various defeats, di&s;comfitures and lo&s;&s;es which we had &s;u&s;tained; it plea&s;ed Divine Prov|idence, to make this brilliant affair the prelude of wonderful &s;ucce&s;s, to the American arms.</P>
<P>The enemy finding their plans of conque&s;t fru&s;trated and broken, changed the theatre of their ho&s;tile operations, and tran&s;ported them|&s;elves to the Che&s;epeak; but at the Brandy-wine, the illu&s;trious Wa&s;hington appeared, and checked their progre&s;s. We then beheld him compelling them to abandon the capital of A|merica, as he had done at Bo&s;ton, and &s;eeking, with precipitation, through the Jer&s;ies, &s;afety on board their fleet. By the co-operating wi&s;|dom of our illu&s;trious chief, with the national Congre&s;s, in plans of military operations, we &s;aw Burgoyne, the vaunting hero of the north, with a motley ho&s;t of Britons, Germans and Savages, lay down their arms, before the vete|ran Gates, and the patriotic militia of New-England. And in the &s;outh, the good and val|ient Green, &s;natching from the brows of Bri|tons, their fading laurels.</P>
<P>To complete the de&s;truction of the unju&s;t and cruel de&s;igns of the enemy, again&s;t our be|loved country, one great work was &s;till to be ac|compli&s;hed, and Heaven re&s;erved this for its fa|vorite
<PB N="14" REF="037866_0013_100F5A70029E3250">
&s;on. Great was the joy of the United States, when the la&s;t great army in the field, un|der their pui&s;&s;ant genral, Cornwallis, &s;urrender|ed at York Town.</P>
<P>The pure&s;t &s;entiments of gratitude to Heaven, mu&s;t have in&s;pired the brea&s;t of WASHINGTON, when the beams of peace diffu&s;ed their ble&s;&s;ings over our land. Rejoicing in this long wi&s;hed for era, &s;urrounded by his officers he &s;aid, "A ret|ro&s;pect of the &s;cenes through which we have pa&s;&s;ed, from the commencement to the conclu|&s;ion of the war, is &s;ufficient to convince infidel|ity it&s;elf, of the exi&s;tence of a Supreme govern|ing Providence."</P>
<P>Having accompli&s;hed eight years arduous la|bor in the defence of his country, and the e&s;tab|li&s;hment of its independence and peace, with undi&s;&s;embled meekne&s;s, and a dignity peculiar to him&s;elf, he re&s;igned his military employments, into the hands of our national council, amid&s;t univer&s;al tears of gratitude and applau&s;e; and taking an affectionate farewell, commended his deare&s;t country to the protection and ble&s;&s;ing of ALMIGHTY GOD. At his country's call, a|gain he relinqui&s;hed the plea&s;ures of dome&s;tic comforts, and with the wi&s;dom of a &s;age, pre|&s;ided in the formation of the be&s;t &s;y&s;tem of gov|ernment, which the world had ever &s;een. By the unanimous &s;uffrage of his country, he was called to fill the highe&s;t office of &s;tate, in our new formed, and well organized Republic.&mdash;The wi&s;dom, moderation and dignity of his ad|mini&s;tration, during eight years, in which he pre&s;ided over the United States, add lu&s;tre to the
<PB N="15" REF="037866_0014_100F5A55B8B41530">
glory which he had acquired by his military achievements.</P>
<P>Leaving to his fellow citizens, the invaluable legacy of his wife coun&s;el and advice, for the pre&s;ervation of their morals and government, freedom and happine&s;s, with the fonde&s;t pre|dilection for the charms of rural and contem|plative life, he affectionately re&s;igned his civil employments, and bid adieu to the burdens of State.</P>
<P>But when a great nation, once our friends and allies, poured indignity and in&s;ult upon us, and by menaces and in&s;idious arts, labored to undermine the fair fabric of our liberties and independence; again obedient to the voice of his country, we &s;aw the venerable WASHINGTON ari&s;e, to vin|dicate our wrongs. His &s;word &s;prung half way from its &s;leeping &s;cabbard; that &s;word, on who&s;e point the ballance of ju&s;tice was ever &s;u&s;|pended, and which had always pointed the way to victory; and at his maje&s;tic pre&s;ence, the wiles of gallic policy and perfidy, were aba&s;hed and confounded.</P>
<P>He was great and exemplary in his death, as well as life. Heaven took him &s;uddenly from us, le&s;t perhaps, we &s;hould place, too much, our hopes and affections on him, and yield to him tho&s;e honors, which are due to GOD.</P>
<P>Such was the man, whom the world admires, and America delights to honor. O WASHING|TON, how precious is the remembrance of thy deeds! How will thy name de&s;cend, embalm|ed with the incen&s;e of gratitude and love, to the millions of yet unborn Americans! The
<PB N="16" REF="037866_0015_100F5A73B55EDF50">
pro&s;perty, the peace, the liberties, and the good and equal laws, and government of thy native country, will be a&s;cribed, under Providence, to thy valour, thy wi&s;dom and benevolence! Enemies venerated thy virtues. The kings of the earth li&s;tened, at the mention of thy name, and &s;hrunk to concious inferiority, at the por|trait of thy more than royal and human virtues.</P>
<P>A celebrated orator in the Briti&s;h parliament, pronounced his eulogeum. "Illu&s;trious man! deriving le&s;s from the &s;plendor of &s;ituation, than from the dignity of his mind; before whom all borrowed greatne&s;s &s;inks into in&s;ignificance. Who can refrain admiring the wi&s;dom and fortune of this great man? It is &s;ingularly fortunate, that he &s;hould have experienced a lot which &s;o &s;el|dom falls to the portion of humanity, and have pa&s;&s;ed through &s;uch a variety of &s;cenes, without &s;tain and without reproach. It mu&s;t indeed create a&s;toni&s;hment, that placed in circum&s;tances &s;o critical, and filling for a &s;eries of time a &s;ta|tion &s;o con&s;picuous, his character &s;hould never once been called in que&s;tion; that he &s;hould on no occa&s;ion have been accu&s;ed, either of improper in&s;olence, or of mean &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, in his tran&s;actions with foreign nations&mdash;It has been re&s;erved for him to run the race of glory, without experiencing the &s;malle&s;t inter|ruption, to the brilliancy of his career. The breath of cen&s;ure has not dared to impeach the purity of his conduct, nor the eye of envy to rai&s;e its malignant glance to the elevation of his virtues. Such has been the tran&s;cendent merit, and the unparrelled fate of this illu&s;trious man."</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="037866_0016_100F5A58DB376C28">
The rank and reputation which this nation holds among the nations of the Earth, are to be a&s;cribed to him, as the honored in&s;trument, in the hands of him who ruleth among the na|tions, and builds them up, or pulls them down, at his plea&s;ure. Let us, &s;irs, be devoutly thank|ful to GOD for the gift of this great and good man. It was GOD who formed and fitted him for the noble and exalted &s;tations which he fill|ed, and gave him ability and inclination to go through the arduous labors, which were a&s;&s;igned him. He was a happy pledge of the &s;miles of Heaven on our righteous cau&s;e, and an earne&s;t of its eventual &s;ucce&s;s. He, in who&s;e hands are the hearts of all men, qualifies them for the work which he a&s;&s;igns them. While therefore, we pay a de&s;erved tribute of gratitude to tho&s;e who have done well in the &s;ervice of mankind, let our higher prai&s;e and gratitude a&s;cend to GOD, from whom cometh down all the good and perfect gifts, which his creatures po&s;&s;e&s;s or enjoy.</P>

In &s;imilar &s;ituations, like minded to him, who&s;e death we lament. He rejoiced in the &s;alvation of his country, as the &s;upreme happine&s;s of his life; and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his integrity, was his con&s;olation in death.

<P>What was the governing principle which for|med the character of this great man? In my opinion, it was religion. Without the &s;malle&s;t tincture of bigotry or &s;uper&s;tition, he appears in all his public and private life, to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a firm belief in GOD, and in divine revelation. He lived and acted under the influence of an habit|ual and lively impre&s;&s;ion of the Deity, and his all governing Providence, and expre&s;&s;ed it on all proper occa&s;ions. Among numerous evidences of this, let me mention his declaration, on the &s;olemn occa&s;ion of his unanimous election and inve&s;titure with the &s;upreme authority of our new formed Republic. "It would," &s;ays he, "be peculiarly improper, to omit in this offi|cial act, my fervent &s;upplications, to that AL|MIGHTY

BEING, who rules over the univer&s;e, who pre&s;ides in the councils of nations, and who&s;e Providential aids can &s;upply every hu|man defect, that his benediction may con&s;ecrate to the liberties and happine&s;s of the people of the United States, a government in&s;tituted by them&s;elves for the&s;e e&s;&s;ential purpo&s;es; and may enable every in&s;trument employed in its admin|i&s;tration, to execute with &s;ucce&s;s, the functions allotted to his charge. In tendering this hom|age to the great author of every public and pri|vate good, I a&s;&s;ure my&s;elf that it expre&s;&s;es your &s;entiments not lo&s;s than my own; nor tho&s;e of my fellow citizens at large, le&s;s than either.</P>
<P>No people can be bound to acknowledge and adore the invi&s;ible hand, which conducts the af|fairs of men more than the people of the&s;e United States. Every &s;tep by which they have advan|ced to the character of an independent nation, &s;eems to have been di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;ome prov|idential agency. And in the important revolu|tion ju&s;t accompli&s;hed in the &s;y&s;tem of their u|nited government, the tranquil deliberations, and voluntary con&s;ent of &s;o many di&s;tinct com|munities, from which the event has re&s;ulted, can|not be compared with the means by which mo&s;t governments have been e&s;tabli&s;hed, without &s;ome return of pious gratitude, with a humble anticipation of the future ble&s;&s;ings which the pa&s;t &s;eem to pre&s;age. The&s;e reflections, ari&s;ing out of the pre&s;ent cri&s;is, have forced them&s;elves too &s;trongly on my mind to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed."</P>
<P>His &s;uperior powers of mind were, by his reverence of GOD and his providence, con&s;e|crated

to mo&s;t exten&s;ive u&s;efulne&s;s, to univer&s;al veneration and immortal fame.</P>
<P>It was religion which in&s;pired him with meek|ne&s;s and moderation in pro&s;perity, and with calmne&s;s and fortitude in adver&s;ity: which &s;hed its cheering beams, around him in his departing moments, and &s;moothed his dying pillow.</P>
<P>There can be no true greatne&s;s without goodne&s;s. The noble&s;t object this world can afford, is a great man, at the head of a nation, adorned with the attributes of religion. In the language of in&s;piration, he is "a God on earth;" an humble repre&s;entative of the Deity in human form; and will command univer&s;al veneration.</P>
<P>In vain will the meer ambitious man, the im|moral philo&s;ophi&s;t, and the unprincipled athei&s;t, labor to ri&s;e to re&s;pectability and glory; though their talents may be brilliant, their motives are de&s;picable and dangerous. The irreligious and vicious, are enemies of their country. And when this is the general character of a people, they invite and draw down public ruin.</P>
<P>May the pre&s;ent and future rulers of our fa|vored land, and all its citizens, be in&s;pired with the lovely &s;pirit of WASHINGTON, and be as he was, peaceable and generous, diligent and faithful, pious and valiant.</P>
<P>He has given freedom to his numerous &s;laves, and made provi&s;ion for their comfortable exi&s;t|ence! May his example be imitated by the numerous holders of their fellow men in bond|age, in the &s;outhern &s;tates, and throughout the world; and the unfortunate children of Ham, po&s;&s;e&s;s the ble&s;&s;ings of liberty, and the comforts of religion.</P>

Every man who loves his country, and wi&s;hes its pro&s;perity, will be the friend and promoter of virtuous education, good morals and the du|ties and offices of religion. For on the&s;e im|mutable pillars, all good government re&s;ts. E&s;|pecially are the general diffu&s;ion of the&s;e ble&s;&s;|ings nece&s;&s;ary, in &s;uch a free government as the one, under which we live.</P>
<P>For building up, and carrying on to perfect|ion, the civil and &s;ocial, dome&s;tic and national happine&s;s; where &s;hall we find a &s;y&s;tem of re|ligion equal, or worthily to be compared, with that which is profe&s;&s;ed by the people of the&s;e States? A religion from Heaven; founded on the divine principle of benevolence: proclaim|ing "peace on earth, and good will to men."</P>
<P>This was the birth day of our illu&s;trious chief. An anniver&s;ary, no more to be celebrated, on earth, in joyous fe&s;tivals and grateful &s;ongs.&mdash;Our joy is turned to mourning. A happy ex|change, we tru&s;t, for him; who, relea&s;ed from the labors of this tran&s;itory &s;tate, is new-born into the world of happy &s;pirits, the kingdom of the ju&s;t. A cele&s;tial birth; celebrated by angels and the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made perfect. Methinks I &s;ee him, with lowly reverence, bow before the throne of GOD and of the LAMB; and hear pronounced the ble&s;&s;ed Euge, "Well done good and faithful &s;ervant: thou ha&s;t been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ru|ler over many things, enter into the joy of thy LORD."</P>

his virtues. And though none of us can be a WASHINGTON, yet we can be friends of GOD and of mankind. Lovers of religion and government, of our country, and of every in|&s;titution productive of human happine&s;s. Let us perpetuate the influence of his good example, who has left us the invaluable legacy of his life, his patrioti&s;m and his virtues. "By the&s;e he has taught us, to be pure in morals&mdash;devout in religion&mdash;fervent in patrioti&s;m&mdash;ju&s;t in the cabi|net&mdash;and invincible in the field."</P>
<P>How are the mighty fallen! While the hearts of millions of Americans, are living monuments of grief; are there any who &s;ecret|ly rejoice at our lo&s;s? The enemies of our ri|&s;ing empire, of religion and order, rejoice.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON is no more! Tell it not in France: publi&s;h it not in the ho&s;tile &s;treets of the envious nations of Europe, le&s;t the wicked triumph.</P>
<P>Let us not give our&s;elves up to &s;orrow and de&s;pondence, at this mournful cri&s;is: but rather imitate the example of the royal p&s;almi&s;t, who did not neglect the care of the Commonwealth, in the mid&s;t of his mourning the death of Saul and Jonathan; but directs his officers, to teach the men of Judah the u&s;e of the bow; and be prepared to defend their country.</P>
<P>Let this in&s;tance of death, teach us the vanity of life, and of all earthly greatne&s;s, and excite us to a vigorous preparation for our own di&s;|&s;olution.</P>
