<HEAD>A LETTER, About a Good Management under the Di&s;temper of the MEASLES, at this time Spreading in the Country. Here Publi&s;hed for the Benefit of the Poor, and &s;uch as may want the help of Able Phy&s;icians.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Good Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE <HI>Mea&s;les</HI> are a Di&s;temper which in <HI>Europe</HI> ordinarily proves a Light Malady: but in the&s;e parts of <HI>America</HI> it proves a very heavy Calamity; A Malady <HI>Grievous</HI> to mo&s;t, <HI>Mortal</HI> to many, &amp; leaving pernicious Relicks behind it in All. Becau&s;e the Sickne&s;s is now &s;preading in all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">rts; and its <HI>Malignity</HI> increa&s;es, as the <HI>Winter</HI> advances, and <HI>Good Phy&s;icians</HI> are not every where at hand for the Relief of the Sick, and a very <HI>nice Management</HI> of the Ca&s;e is requi&s;ite: You are now addre&s;&s;ed with a &s;hort <HI>Letter of Advice</HI> concerning it.</P>
<P>You will by no means forget the fir&s;t and main Care, which is, To <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> an Eye unto the Glorious GOD, who is, <HI>The Lord our Healer.</HI> You are no Stranger to <HI>Exod.</HI> XV. 26. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> CVIII. 12. and XLI. 4. One of the mo&s;t Learned and Famous Phy&s;icians that ever was in the World, the Great <HI>Kirstenius,</HI> has this reported of him; He would <HI>ordinarily do nothing for his Patients, till he &s;aw them fir&s;t hopefully Reconciled unto God.</HI></P>
<P>It &s;hould be Remembred, That multitudes of Lives have been Sa|ved, in the <HI>Mea&s;les</HI> as well as in the <HI>Small-pox,</HI> by peoples being at la&s;t per&s;waded out of the pernicious Methods of <HI>Over-doing,</HI> and <HI>Over-heat|ing,</HI> and giving Things to <HI>force Nature</HI> out of its own orderly way of proceeding. Before we go any further, Let this Advice for the <HI>Sick,</HI> be principally attended to; <HI>Don't kill 'em!</HI> That is to &s;ay, With mi&s;chie|vous Kindne&s;s. Indeed, if we &s;topt here, and &s;aid no more, this were enough to &s;ave more <HI>Lives,</HI> than our <HI>Wars</HI> have de&s;troy'd.</P>
<P>The U&s;ual Symptoms of an <HI>Arre&s;t</HI> from the <HI>Mea&s;les</HI> are, An <HI>Head|ake;</HI> Troubles in the <HI>Eyes;</HI> a Dry <HI>Cough;</HI> an Oppre&s;&s;ion on the <HI>Brea&s;t</HI> or <HI>Stomach;</HI> or a pain there, and in the <HI>Back</HI> and Limbs; and &s;ome|times a <HI>Faintne&s;s,</HI> with <HI>Sickne&s;s,</HI> perhaps <HI>Vomiting,</HI> or <HI>Griping</HI> and <HI>Pur|ging;</HI> A <HI>Thir&s;t,</HI> with a con&s;tant <HI>Fever,</HI> which is mild at fir&s;t, but grows high enough before it has done.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="039577_0002_10147BC75AE43B48">
When &s;uch Symptoms of the Sickne&s;s, bid your Friend look about him, let him not throw away his Life by not being <HI>Sick &s;oon enough.</HI></P>
<P>If the Symptoms are <HI>Gentle,</HI> and the per&s;on can yet claim his place at the Table, or can bear to Sit up, Let him do &s;o, till the <HI>Red Specks</HI> begin to &s;how them&s;elves. But let him keep <HI>hou&s;e,</HI> and keep <HI>warm;</HI> not dare to expo&s;e him&s;elf. Let him <HI>feed &s;paringly</HI> and on a very <HI>Ea&s;y Food.</HI> Tho' an Hourly Appearance of the Enemy may be Expected, yet be not in an Hurry. No Ha&s;te of your <HI>Hot Things:</HI> Wait with a little patience. A little <HI>Brim&s;tone</HI> finely powdered, as much as may lie on a <HI>Six-pence,</HI> twice or thrice a day, may do more than Twelve penniworth of Service.</P>
<P>If there be any Shocking <HI>Violence</HI> in the Symptoms, or the Red Specks begin to make their Appearance, let the per&s;on take his <HI>Bed,</HI> and be &s;ure to Lie very <HI>warm,</HI> till all be over. In the Winter, <HI>Infants</HI> are be&s;t kept in the <HI>Arms.</HI></P>
<P>Ordinarily, <HI>Sweating</HI> mu&s;t not be indulged, much le&s;s provok<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&punc; But a comfortable <HI>warmth,</HI> I &s;ay, a convenient <HI>warmth,</HI> cannot be too much in|culcated. As many <HI>Coverings,</HI> as the Times that the word, <HI>Warmth,</HI> oc|curs in our now &s;peaking of it, may be little enough.</P>
<P>A <HI>Gentle Vomit</HI> in the beginning, has had much Benefit expected from it. Be &s;ure, if there be an <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ion</HI> by a Body of Phlegm, or an over|charg'd Stomach, or any thing of a <HI>Nau&s;eous</HI> Inclination, a <HI>Gentle Vomit</HI> is loudly called for.</P>
<P>If there be none of this, but only a <HI>pain</HI> in the Head, and Brea&s;t, Back, and Limbs, a moderate <HI>Sweat</HI> may do. It may be procured, by the well-known preparation which is become every bodies Fir&s;t Re&s;ort, <HI>Syrup of Saffron and Treacle Water.</HI> A <HI>Tea</HI> of <HI>Sage,</HI> or of <HI>Ro&s;emary,</HI> or a little Mull'd <HI>Cider,</HI> or <HI>Wine</HI> with tho&s;e Plants infu&s;ed, will do well. Some can di&s;pen&s;e, with an Infu&s;ion of the <HI>Snakeweed.</HI> But others are for waving it, as too fiery and enraging in a Di&s;temper which is allow'd by all to be an <HI>Inflammatory Fever.</HI> A <HI>Scabious</HI> Tea will do. There is al&s;o a Compo&s;ition of Hot <HI>Beer</HI> and <HI>Rum</HI> (for which they that are Learned in &s;uch potions, do not want a Name,) this <HI>coar&s;e Compo&s;ition,</HI> has been of Good Con&s;equence. But it mu&s;t be very <HI>weak;</HI> and it mu&s;t not be u&s;ed <HI>often,</HI> if <HI>at all</HI> after the <HI>Mea&s;les</HI> appear in the Skin. The u&s;e of &s;uch Things mu&s;t be very Temperate; It may be continued until the full Eruption. But I repeat the Admonition again&s;t, <HI>Over-doing</HI> and <HI>Over-heating.</HI> It will &s;poil all.</P>
<P>The <HI>Coar&s;e Compo&s;ition</HI> afore&s;aid, will be&s;t &s;uit the <HI>pained</HI> Patient. But it will hardly do &s;o well, in <HI>Costive</HI> Bodies; or where the <HI>Brea&s;t</HI> is op|pre&s;&s;ed; or where the <HI>Fever</HI> is high, or in too <HI>hot Constitutions.</HI> That
<PB N="3" REF="039577_0003_10147BC996878C30">
<HI>Coar&s;e Compo&s;ition,</HI> 'tis a very &s;trange thing, that if it happen to Do a <HI>Little Good now and then,</HI> people mu&s;t pre&s;ently be <HI>Bewitched</HI> with it!</P>
<P>Where the Patient is mo&s;t prone to be <HI>faint,</HI> a <HI>Balm Tea,</HI> or a Gla&s;s of <HI>Wine</HI> a little <HI>Saffronized,</HI> may do very well. Twenty or Thirty Drops of good <HI>Elixir Proprietatis,</HI> have been &s;ometimes very &s;erviceable to them that could be Ma&s;ters of it, in this as well as many other Ca&s;es; But, <HI>this does not happen to every man!</HI></P>
<P>Your Patient is by this time full of the <HI>Mea&s;les.</HI> He'll be <HI>Thirsty.</HI> And what &s;hall he do?</P>
<P>If he will venture to drink any thing that is <HI>Cold,</HI> it will be well, if he don't find, <HI>There is Death in the Pot.</HI></P>
<P>Let him Drink a <HI>Tea</HI> of <HI>Balm,</HI> and <HI>Scabious.</HI> If he be <HI>Faint,</HI> or <HI>Sick,</HI> add a little <HI>Saffron.</HI> If he be <HI>Loo&s;e,</HI> Let the <HI>Tea</HI> be of <HI>Sage,</HI> or of <HI>Ro&s;e-mary.</HI> If he be <HI>Grip't,</HI> it may have <HI>Penny-royal</HI> in it.</P>
<P>But what is to be done, if a <HI>Cough</HI> annoy him? Then a <HI>Pectoral</HI> of Maiden-hair, Anni&s;eed, Liquorice, Rai&s;ins, and Figs. <HI>Liquorice</HI> alone, in a Tea, may do. Or, if that can't be had, a Syrup of Maiden-hair, of <HI>Hy&s;&s;op,</HI> and of <HI>Colts foot.</HI> The <HI>Cough</HI> mu&s;t not be &s;topt; you may al|lay it with <HI>Sugar-Candied,</HI> and with <HI>Buttered Pills;</HI> and the <HI>Pectorals</HI> now pre&s;cribed. Or, <HI>Hot Honey</HI> alone will do admirably well.</P>
<P>In hot Con&s;titutions e&s;pecially, a proper <HI>Drink</HI> would be, <HI>Water with Roa&s;ted Apples</HI> in it. Some would add a little <HI>Ginger</HI> to it.</P>
<P>Hot <HI>Cyder,</HI> if it be not <HI>hard,</HI> is an allowable <HI>Drink.</HI></P>
<P>Towards the Heighth of the Di&s;temper, <HI>Hy&s;&s;op</HI> Tea may be prefer|rible to <HI>Scabious.</HI> Let the <HI>Diet</HI> (thro' the whole cour&s;e) be <HI>Thin</HI> e|nough; Gruels, Caudles, Water-pottage, and the like; and given <HI>Of|ten</HI> enough.</P>
<P>About the Third or Fourth Day, from the Eruption, will come the <HI>Cri&s;is,</HI> which you call, the <HI>Turning.</HI> And this will be often attended with <HI>Frightful Circum&s;tances;</HI> Grievous Oppre&s;&s;ion, Fainting, Vomiting, Purging, and the <HI>Vapours,</HI> which is to &s;ay in one word, <HI>All that is terri|ble.</HI> But all will be pre&s;ently and ea&s;ily relieved, if Heaven afford a Ble&s;&s;ing to a proper Management. Sometimes the &s;udden Di&s;appea|rance of the <HI>Mea&s;les</HI> give a <HI>Needle&s;s Fright.</HI> They have perform'd their cour&s;e; but the frighted Patient flies to <HI>hot Expellers,</HI> which endanger the rai&s;ing of a putrefactive Heat, that had better have been &s;pared. Some have ob&s;erved, That the&s;e <HI>Frightful Circumstances</HI> have come with their greate&s;t Fury, where the praevious u&s;e of <HI>Hot Things,</HI> which you have been &s;o warn'd about, has been Immoderate.</P>
<P>For the <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ion,</HI> take <HI>Wine</HI> and <HI>Oil,</HI> (or if the Patient be Loo&s;e, let him take, <HI>Rum</HI> and <HI>Oil:</HI>) Give it pretty hot; The Do&s;e two or three
<PB N="4" REF="039577_0004_10160EDD51BF7118">
Spoonfuls every Hour, as there may be Occa&s;ion; Or, take almo&s;t any thing, that will cau&s;e a <HI>Vomit</HI> or two. A <HI>Gentle Vomit</HI> at this Time, has Reprieved many a Life, that was ju&s;t Expiring: E&s;pecially when there is a Collection of a wretched <HI>Phlegm,</HI> to be Encountred. The <HI>Wine</HI> and <HI>Oil</HI> is preferrible to the <HI>Rum</HI> and <HI>Oil.</HI> And when a <HI>Vomit</HI> would not relieve the Oppre&s;&s;ion, the <HI>Wine</HI> &amp; <HI>Oil,</HI> with a Decoction of the <HI>Cooling Seeds,</HI> has pre&s;ently done it.</P>
<P>You have been taught already what you &s;hall do for <HI>Faintne&s;s</HI> in your Patient. Or, Give him a few Drops of the <HI>Spirit of Hart&s;horn</HI></P>
<P>For his <HI>Vomiting</HI> and <HI>Purging,</HI> you need not go far for a Remedy. Give &s;calding <HI>Hot water;</HI> Do this, even to nine or ten times, if it be needful, &amp; as he can bear it. Then give a little <HI>Hot Wine</HI> with a bit of toa&s;ted <HI>Bread.</HI> Or a little of the <HI>Coar&s;e Compo&s;ition,</HI> you were formerly told of; Or ano|ther, that is <HI>akin</HI> to that, and as <HI>well-known</HI> as that. In twenty four hours, more or le&s;s, it may be hoped, the Storm will be over.</P>
<P>For a <HI>con&s;iderable while</HI> after this, the Patient mu&s;t be mighty careful of taking any <HI>Cold,</HI> and Eating too &s;oon of any <HI>Fle&s;h-meat.</HI> Let him not be <HI>well too &s;oon,</HI> and throw him&s;elf into a <HI>Fever,</HI> and throw away his <HI>Life,</HI> as many have incon&s;iderately and pre&s;umptuou&s;ly done. Let him <HI>take Time,</HI> and &s;pend his Time, in <HI>Studying to be Thankful.</HI></P>
<P>If a <HI>Cough</HI> continue, let him fly to the u&s;ual Remedies. To take a &s;poon|ful of &s;havings of <HI>Ca&s;tile Soap</HI> in a Gla&s;s of Wine or Beer, for a few Nights following, has been very &s;ucce&s;sful for the cure or that inconvenience&punc; If <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <HI>Flux</HI> follow, whether a <HI>common,</HI> or a <HI>Bloody,</HI> a <HI>Tea</HI> made of <HI>Rhubarb,</HI> and &s;weetened with a Syrup of <HI>Mar&s;hmallows,</HI> given daily, &s;o much as to cau&s;e one or two Stools, is a way to carry it &s;afely off. The &s;ame <HI>Tea</HI> will al&s;o carry off the <HI>Worms,</HI> that &s;o often follow the <HI>Mea&s;les;</HI> e&s;pecially in <HI>Children.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Purge</HI> will be nece&s;&s;ary for all, that would not have the Venome of the <HI>Mea&s;les</HI> remaining in them, and follow'd with many Evil Con&s;equences.</P>
<P>A <HI>Fever</HI> (perhaps that which they call, The <HI>Pleuretick</HI>) too of|ten follows the <HI>Mea&s;les.</HI> But for this, I do not now offer any Directions: A Skilful <HI>Phy&s;ician</HI> mu&s;t be con&s;ulted withal.</P>
<P>All that is propo&s;ed in this Letter, is to direct in the plaine&s;t manner that is po&s;&s;ible, without any <HI>Terms of Art,</HI> &amp; &s;o that any <HI>Child</HI> may under&s;tand, &amp; any <HI>Nur&s;e</HI> may admini&s;ter, what is to be done, in the &s;ingle Ca&s;e of the <HI>Mea&s;les:</HI> Which Malady, tho' it be not &s;o <HI>Dangerous</HI> in it &s;elf perhaps, as many others are, yet upon the <HI>Lea&s;t Error</HI> in treating of it, proves as <HI>Dead|ly,</HI> as mo&s;t that the poor <HI>Children of Death</HI> fall before. I <HI>know</HI> not (and for &s;ome Rea&s;ons I have read in a very Ancient Book, I may add, I <HI>care</HI> not,) what <HI>Cen&s;ures</HI> this Action may meet withal. I am &s;ure, nothing but a pure <HI>Act of Charity to the Poor,</HI> where <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI> are wanting, is now intended; nor any thing offered, but what a Number of our mo&s;t Eminent <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI> have approved of, with their Charitable Wi&s;hes to have it Communicated; and the helping, tho' of but one or two Mi&s;erables, weighs down, again&s;t all that may be &s;aid, again&s;t the Freedom which this Letter has taken. I am &s;atisfied, The Angel of <HI>Bethe&s;da</HI> would E&s;teem it &s;o. I take Leave;</P>
