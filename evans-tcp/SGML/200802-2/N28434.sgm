<OPENER><SALUTE>FELLOW CITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>UNITED AMERICA a&s;&s;emble this day to pay their la&s;t re&s;pects to the admired hero and &s;age, the father of his country, the friend of mankind. He hath re&s;igned his &s;pirit into the hand of his maker. "He lives only in his own great actions, and in the hearts of an affectionate and afflicted people."</P>
<P>A FAITHFUL hi&s;tory of his life, and an impar|tial delineation of his public and private virtues, would be the only eulogy worthy of WASHINGTON. But who can define that &s;ublime philo&s;ophy which directed and animated all his actions&mdash;his genius enriched with information and fruitful in re&s;ources &mdash;his wi&s;ely concerted and well executed plans! Who can de&s;cribe his purity of morals, dignity of manners, mildne&s;s and equanimity, patience in ad|ver&s;ity and moderation in pro&s;perity, firmne&s;s in danger and per&s;everance in difficulties! If, in the &s;ketch of his hi&s;tory and character, a &s;trong affec|tion for the man &s;hould appear, blended with a rev|erence for his talents, your candor and the &s;ympa|thy of your feelings will be the &s;peaker's apology.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="037886_0003_100F61FF308CD158">THIS day completes &s;ixty eight years &s;ince the pari&s;h of Wa&s;hington, in the county of We&s;tmore|land, in Virginia, gave birth to this great man. He was educated by private in&s;truction. An excel|lent under&s;tanding early convinced him of the ad|vantages of virtue, the plea&s;ure of knowledge, and the nece&s;&s;ity of labor. An uncommon mildne&s;s and moderation of temper pre&s;erved him from the a&s;|&s;aults of pa&s;&s;ion, and the allurements of vice. By the natural &s;trength and &s;uperiority of his genius, without experience, he broke out at once a gene|ral and a hero. At the age of twenty-three, he was &s;ent, by his native &s;tate, with the command of four hundred men again&s;t the French, in the vicin|ity of the Ohio, who had committed many acts of ho&s;tility again&s;t the Briti&s;h &s;ubjects. Attacked at Red&s;tone, by an army nearly four times as nume|rous as his own, valiant as Achilles, he made a brave defence, killed two hundred of the enemy, and obliged the French to grant him an honorable capitulation. The ma&s;terly manner in which he &s;oon after covered the retreating army of Gen. Braddock, drew upon him the highe&s;t encomiums from his country. Through the whole of that war, he di&s;played an energy of character, which pre&s;a|ged, that he might be de&s;igned by Providence for a future &s;aviour of his country.</P>
<P>IN the Congre&s;s of 1775 he was di&s;tingui&s;hed by every deference, which &s;uperior merit is &s;ure to re|ceive from noble minds. He felt an early indigna|tion at the oppre&s;&s;ions of the Briti&s;h. The com|mand
<PB N="5" REF="037886_0004_100F62018B270AA0">
of her armies being intru&s;ted to him by his country, he accepted it from duty, relinqui&s;hing the enjoyments of affluence, and the highe&s;t dome&s;|tic felicity. Having no intere&s;ted views, the friends of liberty repo&s;ed the highe&s;t confidence in his abil|ities and integrity. How well this confidence was placed, every page of our revolution bears glori|ous atte&s;tation. What difficulties did he not en|counter? What danger did he decline? Who has marked his fortitude in the hour of adver&s;ity, with|out hoping relief from his prudence? Who has beheld him in battle, without confiding in the wi&s;|dom of his arrangements, and repo&s;ing on the val|or of his arm? Who, among his followers, did not find his &s;ufferings &s;olaced in &s;eeing them &s;hared by his chief? Tho&s;e can be&s;t de&s;cribe his military character, who followed him in his expeditions, who &s;tudied his marches, his encampments, his di&s;|po&s;itions before a battle, and his courage in the heat of conflict; who beheld him penetrating, at a glance, the projects of the enemy, multiplying around them almo&s;t inevitable ambu&s;hes, creating and pre&s;erving a happy di&s;cipline in his army, ex|citing, by new and efficacious methods, the ardor of his &s;oldiers, and unremittingly exerting him&s;elf for their pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>TO view him as a perfect model of military great|ne&s;s, to rank him with the greate&s;t generals of any age, is no amplification. In him were blended ac|tivity, vigilance, great force of judgment, and never failing pre&s;ence of mind. He could unite in|formation
<PB N="6" REF="037886_0005_100F620327962BA8">
with talents, reflection with experience, and &s;tratagem with glory. Cautious, &s;y&s;tematic, and inflexible, his genius was &s;ingularly adapted to our revolutionary war. Di&s;tingui&s;hing, with pre|ci&s;ion, the difference between great difficulties and impo&s;&s;ibilities, and never di&s;couraged by the for|mer, he often appeared to execute the latter. In|defatigably laborious and active, coolly intrepid in action, he di&s;cerned as by intuition, &s;eized with ra|pidity, and improved with &s;kill, the favorable, and often deci&s;ive, moments of battle. Never tran&s;|ported by the enthu&s;ia&s;m of patrioti&s;m, never de|luded by the ardor of courage, he preferred &s;trata|gem to action, and victory to glory. Mode&s;t and magnanimous after victory, he became the gene|rous protector of his &s;ubdued and captive enemies. Re&s;olute and undejected in misfortunes, he ro&s;e &s;u|perior to di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and &s;urmounted difficulties, which no courage, no con&s;tancy, but his own, would have re&s;i&s;ted. His letters, during his mo&s;t gloomy pro&s;pects, announce a hero, con&s;cious of his danger, but &s;till deriving a well grounded hope from the re&s;ources of his own mind. His valor was never unequal to his duty or the occa&s;ion. He attempted great things with means that appeared totally inadequate, and &s;ucce&s;sfully pro&s;ecuted what he had boldly re&s;olved. He was never di&s;heartened by difficulties, but had that vigor of mind, which, in&s;tead of bending to oppo&s;ition, ri&s;es above it, and &s;eems to have a power of controling even fortune it&s;elf. His character combined a cool and pene|trating judgment and prompt deci&s;ion, caution and
<PB N="7" REF="037886_0006_100F6205894F3590">
intrepidity, patience and enterpri&s;e, generous ten|derne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion, with undaunted heroi&s;m. He was a never failing re&s;ource to tho&s;e who want|ed his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. No one could have more happily concentrated the confidence of his troops. Their obedience was le&s;s owing to the authority of his po&s;t, than to their opinion of his valor; &s;o attach|ed to him were the officers and &s;oldiers, that if a principle of duty and virtue had not &s;ecured their obedience to their country, gratitude and re&s;pect for their general would have confirmed it. Even when worn out with fatigue they were ever ready to execute his orders, and no danger could intimi|date them when they were commanded by WASH|INGTON. He him&s;elf always &s;hared in the toils he was obliged to impo&s;e, vi&s;ited in per&s;on the &s;ick and the wounded, and expre&s;&s;ed, on every occa|&s;ion, the greate&s;t regard for a body of men, who&s;e welfare was &s;o clo&s;ely connected with that of his country. By the &s;tricte&s;t rules he labored to in&s;pire them with a &s;en&s;e of duty, and neglected no cir|cum&s;tance which might render them formidable to their enemies. He was eloquent, per&s;ua&s;ive, &s;trong, and pathetic, as occa&s;ion required. He had argu|ments and tears at his command. In a word, he was a general formed by heaven for ju&s;t &s;uch a pe|riod, country, and cau&s;e, as ours. And you too well know to be informed, that his great talents and patrioti&s;m, his equally judicious and vigorous mea&s;ures, effected the &s;alvation of his country, and commanded the admiration and applau&s;e of the whole world.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="037886_0007_100F62098D6F83A0">AFTER the ratification of a treaty of peace, which &s;atisfied our mo&s;t &s;anguine wi&s;hes and expectations, he re&s;igned his commi&s;&s;ion, enjoying the plea&s;ing hope of &s;pending the re&s;idue of his days in the re|treats and occupations of private life. Having pa&s;&s;|ed in a rapid revolution from the dangers of &s;lavery to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of liberty, the whole country, in the tran&s;ports of gratitude, forgot their own mighty exertions, the influence of general cau&s;es, and the irre&s;i&s;tible energy of man fighting for free|dom, and a&s;cribed their &s;ucce&s;s to the virtues and talents of WASHINGTON.</P>
<P>THE character of this great man would be im|paired by a compari&s;on with the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed generals either of ancient or modern times. <HI>Alex|ander, Charles</HI> of Sweden, and <HI>Kouli Khan,</HI> were born with an in&s;atiable thir&s;t for human blood, and habituated, from their infancy, to the mo&s;t inhu|man actions. Their immoderate ambition made them the &s;courge of mankind and the pe&s;t of the world.&mdash;<HI>Hannibal's</HI> talents and victories were tar|ni&s;hed by cruelty, treachery, and a total di&s;regard to truth, honor, and morality.&mdash;<HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> was provident in council, fearle&s;s in action, humane and generous to exce&s;s; but his glory was &s;ullied by an inordinate love of plea&s;ure, and an unbounded ambition. His great talents would have made him the fir&s;t citizen of Rome; but he di&s;dained the con|dition of a &s;ubject. The great object of his life was to rule, and Cato very ju&s;tly remarked, that "he came, with &s;obriety and meditation, to the &s;ubver&s;ion
<PB N="9" REF="037886_0008_100F620BDEBBC088">
of the republic."&mdash;None ever exhibited greater bravery in dangerous undertakings, or more pre&s;|ence of mind and conduct in their execution, than <HI>Trajan</HI>; but the prai&s;es of Alexander, blazoned by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of panegyri&s;ts, kindled a dangerous emulation in his mind. "Like him," &s;ays Gibbon, "the Roman emperor undertook an expedition again&s;t the nations of the ea&s;t; but he lamented, with a &s;igh, that his advanced age &s;carcely left him any hopes of equalling the renown of the &s;on of Phillip."&mdash;<HI>Charles the fir&s;t</HI> of France, <HI>Edward the third</HI> of England, and the Emperor <HI>Charles the fifth,</HI> di&s;played a&s;toni&s;hing military talents, and were not le&s;s illu&s;trious in the cabinet than in the field. But the fir&s;t wantonly ma&s;&s;acred 4500 Saxons &s;ole|ly for their loyalty to their prince. He appeared to regard truth, ju&s;tice, and humanity, only as impor|tunate monitors, which &s;hould be kept at a di&s;tance, or puni&s;hed for their intru&s;ion. The love of glory was the ruling pa&s;&s;ion of the two la&s;t, to the grati|fication of which they &s;acrificed the intere&s;ts of their country, and every &s;entiment of humanity.&mdash;<HI>Fred|erick the &s;econd</HI> and the <HI>Duke of Marlborough</HI> were, perhaps, perfect ma&s;ters of the military art. Ha|ving been, from their childhood, continually in war, and at the head of armies, they joined to all the capacity which genius could give, all the knowledge and &s;kill whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h experience could teach. But the former "&s;laughtered the armies of half the nations of Eu|rope, merely to extend the limits of an electorate," and, being an open con&s;pirator again&s;t the religion of JESUS, infected the world with his impieties&mdash;the
<PB N="10" REF="037886_0009_100F28C24683B980">
latter, hurried to exce&s;s by the violence of his pa&s;|&s;ions, was much le&s;s fitted to prevent evils by his wi&s;e precautions, than to remedy them by his vigor and enterpri&s;e.</P>
<P>NONE of the&s;e heroes could claim the a&s;&s;emblage of coolne&s;s and &s;pirit, humanity and munificence, prudence and vigor, patient un&s;haken con&s;tancy, untainted patrioti&s;m and &s;uperiority to popular clam|or, which di&s;tingui&s;hed the Father of our country. None of them e&s;tabli&s;hed the freedom and inde|pendence of his nation; or exchanged the in&s;tru|ments of war for the implements of hu&s;bandry; or was rewarded by the hone&s;t pride of virtue, the exqui&s;ite delight of beholding the general hap|pine&s;s of which he was the author. The com|manders of armies are taught, by the example of WASHINGTON, that well earned military applau&s;es may be pre&s;erved, without power or &s;plendor, in private life.</P>
<P>RESTORED to his endeared retirement, and to tho&s;e rural occupations which con&s;tituted his great|e&s;t enjoyment, he was &s;carcely permitted to repo&s;e from the fatigues of the war, when the imperious voice of his country again &s;ummoned him to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The confederation, formed under the pre&s;&s;ure of foreign war and dome&s;tic di&s;tre&s;s, was found incompetent to the ends propo&s;ed, and both the honor and happine&s;s of the United States requi|red a reformation. For this purpo&s;e a convention was called in the year 1787, of which he was cho|&s;en Pre&s;ident. His opinions and example, at this
<PB N="11" REF="037886_0010_100F6210C5940A20">
time, largely contributed to a &s;pirit of national ac|commodation, and &s;ecured an harmonious acquie&s;|cence in our pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of federal government. Invited by his fellow-citizens to organize and ad|mini&s;ter this government, he complied, without bal|ancing a moment between per&s;onal con&s;iderations and public duty. His acceptance was the pre&s;age of a pro&s;perity, which was to remedy the evils of in|ternal di&s;&s;en&s;ions and a feeble government. Cling|ing to him as the anchor of their hope, the people were not di&s;appointed. Of the ability and integrity with which he di&s;charged the functions of this high and arduous office, the public voice and public re|gret bear ample and merited te&s;timony. It may, indeed, be truly &s;aid, that the annals of no nation record a &s;eries of &s;ervices, commen&s;urate in their con&s;equences, with tho&s;e, which he rendered his country, during his admini&s;tration. To an unex|tingui&s;hed ardor for the public good, he joined a per&s;everance in the pur&s;uit of it, which &s;ubdued all ob&s;tacles. His genius, adequate to every trying occa&s;ion, appeared to expand as difficulties occur|red. His di&s;cerning judgment filled the &s;everal de|partments of &s;tate with officers of approved merit, with whom he invariably con&s;ulted, before he of|ficially decided, on bu&s;ine&s;s of moment to his coun|try. His well timed and efficient mea&s;ures pre&s;erv|ed us from the de&s;olation and horrors of foreign and dome&s;tic war. Under his admini&s;tration, the excellent organization of the different branches of the federal con&s;titution, the judicious appointments, and the energy applied to all its operations, gave it a ba&s;is which &s;ecured the happine&s;s and pro&s;perity of our country.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="037886_0011_100F6213162E92D8">IN no &s;ituation did WASHINGTON appear more truly great than at the helm of our federal govern|ment. Here he di&s;played an a&s;toni&s;hing extent and preci&s;ion of political talents, a di&s;intere&s;ted integ|rity, an incorruptible heart, a con&s;tant attention to the grand principles of rational liberty, and an in|variable attachment to his country. His genius was equal to the mo&s;t enlarged views, and minute de|tails, of civil policy. A vigorous mind, improved by the experience and &s;tudy of mankind, dexterity and application in bu&s;ine&s;s, a judicious mixture of liberality and oeconomy, &s;teadine&s;s to pur&s;ue his ends, and flexibility to vary his means, marked his admini&s;tration. He guided the pa&s;&s;ions of others, becau&s;e he was ma&s;ter of his own. Had his char|acter and feelings been more fervid, his conduct might not have been &s;o exemplary, nor his glory &s;o exalted and permanent. Patriotic from principle, and temperate from con&s;titution, he neither di&s;dain|ed nor &s;ought elevation; but always retained a hu|mility, which demon&s;trated, even to political jeal|ou&s;y, that a man, capable of bearing &s;o many hon|ors, fully de&s;erved them. He was provident with|out timidity, &s;evere in the execution of ju&s;tice with|out rigor, moderate when his own intere&s;ts were the &s;ubject of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and inflexibly firm when tho&s;e of his country were in que&s;tion. He &s;tood a rock in the mid&s;t of the ocean, receiving unmoved the vi|olence of its waves.</P>
<P>WHEN the revolving period of the third election of a Pre&s;ident approached, he con&s;idered that duty no longer demanded a &s;acrifice of inclination, and
<PB N="13" REF="037886_0012_100F62149BC99A08">
publi&s;hed his valedictory addre&s;s to the people of the United States. In this &s;econd re&s;ignation he ap|pears &s;uperior to ancient or modern examples. Oth|ers have, indeed, relinqui&s;hed offices of equal tru&s;t; but, generally, the vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune, and the di&s;appointment of their favorite &s;chemes, urged them to abdicate a power, which they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound inade|quate to their ambition.</P>
<P>THE American leader now con&s;oled him&s;elf with the reflection, that he had entirely quitted the con|&s;tant anxiety and high re&s;pon&s;ibility of public life. Minds long exerci&s;ed in bu&s;ine&s;s rarely form habits of conver&s;ing with them&s;elves, and, in the lo&s;s of power, principally regret the want of occupation. But retirement was natural and delightful to WASH|INGTON. He di&s;charged the duties of a private cit|izen with a conde&s;cen&s;ion and greatne&s;s of mind peculiar to him&s;elf. He had, however, been too long in the public &s;ervice to enjoy, without diminu|tion, the comforts and &s;ecurity of retirement. "Angry clouds began to ri&s;e:" And it was impo&s;|&s;ible, that he could be unaffected with the afflictions and dangers of his country. At the public call he a|gain came forward to direct and command our ar|mies, exhibiting another proof of unrivalled great|ne&s;s. On this pinnacle of earthly glory he &s;tood, "venerable in &s;ervices as in years, the cement and bulwark of our nation," till he was &s;ummoned to join <HI>the armies in heaven.</HI></P>
<P>THE private character of this great man emi|nently corre&s;ponded with the &s;plendor of his pub|lic
<PB N="14" REF="037886_0013_100F621670C248D8">
reputation. The native &s;implicity of his virtue was a &s;tranger to vanity or affectation. He enjoyed, with moderation, the advantages of his fortune, and the innocent plea&s;ures of &s;ociety. He was &s;e|vere to him&s;elf, indulgent to the imperfections of others, ju&s;t and beneficent to all mankind. Sin|cerity and candor, a true &s;en&s;e of honor, ju&s;tice, and public liberty, appeared to be the inherent prin|ciples of his nature, and the uniform rule of his conduct. The largene&s;s of his heart equalled that of his fortune. Without thinking of his own greatne&s;s, without fearing le&s;t others &s;hould forget it, he was ea&s;y of acce&s;s, untainted with rancor or jealou&s;y, and ever ready to li&s;ten to ju&s;t complaints. "He appears," indeed, "to have been the com|plete model of that perfect character, which, un|der the denomination of a &s;age or a wi&s;e man, the philo&s;ophers have been fond of delineating, rather as a fiction of their imagination, than in hope of ever &s;eeing it reduced to practice&mdash;&s;o happily were all his virtues tempered together, &s;o ju&s;tly were they blended, and &s;o powerfully did each prevent the other from exceeding its proper bounds." In a word, co-temporary jealou&s;y, envy, and malignity, were com|pelled to applaud both his public and private char|acter, and more impartial po&s;terity will read it with admiration.</P>
<P>HIS fortitude, in the la&s;t &s;cene of his invaluable life, gave an illu&s;trious &s;tamp to the traits he had exhibited. Oppre&s;&s;ed by grievous pain, he breath|ed his la&s;t with the &s;ublime tranquillity of a good man, con&s;cious of having devoted his talents to the &s;ervice of virtue and mankind.</P>

<P>SUCH was the man for whom our country mourns. Humanity cannot withhold her tears. We have been deprived of our brighte&s;t ornament, of the guide and patron, on who&s;e wi&s;dom, experience, and harmonizing influence, we could implicitly rely. To him as the author of our independence, and, while he lived, its firm &s;upport, our reverence is particularly due. "He could pa&s;s through no A|merican &s;tate, &s;urvey no field, and tread on no &s;pot of ground, which he did not &s;ave from deva&s;ta|tion." He could "mix with no a&s;&s;embly, vi&s;it no family, and acco&s;t no per&s;on, who mu&s;t not &s;ay, <HI>Our freedom, our peace, our &s;afety, we owe fir&s;t to God, and next to you."</HI> He could "turn his ear to no &s;ound of joy, which he had not a &s;hare in exciting; and open his eye to no &s;cene of comfort, which did not trace him as its origin." Like the central orb of the planetary world, he enlightened and anima|ted, cemented and beautified, our whole political &s;y&s;tem. With a &s;kilful, &s;teady, yet gentle, hand, he moulded a confu&s;ed ma&s;s of di&s;cordant materials in|to one regular and harmonious compound. And by a &s;trictly ju&s;t and paternal admini&s;tration, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e dif|fu&s;ed the ble&s;&s;ings of freedom, tranquillity, public and private pro&s;perity, throughout all cla&s;&s;es of peo|ple.</P>

In all the changes to which you may be invited, remember, particularly, that for the efficient management of your common intere&s;t, in a country &s;o exten&s;ive, a government of as much vigor as is con&s;i&s;tent with the perfect &s;ecurity of rational liberty, is indi&s;pen&s;i|ble. Reverence religion and morality. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patrioti&s;m, who would labor to &s;ubvert the&s;e great pillars of hu|man happine&s;s, and the firme&s;t props of the duties of men and citizens. Promote in&s;titutions for the gen|eral diffu&s;ion of knowledge. As an important &s;ource of &s;trength and &s;ecurity, cheri&s;h public credit. Cul|tivate peace and harmony with all nations. Exclude inveterate antipathies again&s;t &s;ome, and pa&s;&s;ionate attachments for others. The nation which indul|ges towards another an habitual hatred or an ha|bitual fondne&s;s, is a &s;lave to its animo&s;ity or to its affection, either of which is &s;ufficient to pervert it from its duty and intere&s;t. If I may flatter my&s;elf, that the&s;e coun&s;els of an old, affectionate friend may be productive of &s;ome partial benefit, of &s;ome occa|&s;ional good&mdash;that they may &s;ometimes recur to mod|erate the fury of party &s;pirit, to warn again&s;t the mi&s;chiefs of foreign influence, and to guard again&s;t the impo&s;tures of pretended patrioti&s;m; this hope will be a full recompence for the &s;olicitude for your your welfare by which they have been dictated."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Gen.
