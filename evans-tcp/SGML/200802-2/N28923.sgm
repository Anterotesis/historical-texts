<Q><HI>AND HEZEKIAH SLEPT WITH HIS FATHERS, AND THEY BURIED HIM IN THE CHIEFEST OF THE SEPULCHRES OF THE SONS OF DAVID; AND ALL JUDAH AND THE INHABITANTS OF JERUSALEM DID HIM HONOUR AT HIS DEATH.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS &s;hort account of Hezeki|ah's death and funeral, clearly proves the excel|lence of his character, and that the people loved him; and will open a way for a variety of reflections &s;uitable to the pre&s;ent &s;olemn, and affecting occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>He was the &s;on of Ahaz, who was addicted to idolatry, and, at his death, left the people in a very corrupt and melancholy condition. Hez|ekiah, on the decea&s;e of his father, a&s;cended the
<PB N="6" REF="038563_0005_10126C15B1981350">
throne, and at once began the work of national reformation. In the fir&s;t month of the fir&s;t year of his reign, he opened the doors of the temple, had them repaired, and ordered the prie&s;ts and the Levites to clean&s;e and purify it, and thus to prepare it for religious wor&s;hip. He attended to its dedication with uncommon &s;olemnity, and kept the pa&s;&s;over with great devotion.</P>
<P>He broke down the idols in his dominions, and even de&s;troyed the brazen &s;erpent which Mo&s;es &s;et up, becau&s;e the people were led by it to idolatry.</P>
<P>He was not only a man of religion, but a good prince; and the kingdom flouri&s;hed dur|ing his reign. He &s;ubdued the Phili&s;tines, and freed the nation from the yoke of the A&s;&s;yri|ans. His chief object was to make the people happy.</P>
<P>He al&s;o had great trials. Sennacherib in|vaded his country, and threatened to de&s;troy the city Jeru&s;alem, unle&s;s he complied with his ex|travagant demand. In order to obtain peace, and cau&s;e him to leave his dominions, he paid him three hundred talents of &s;ilver, and thirty talents of gold. As &s;oon as he had received the money, he violated the agreement, and de|manded an immediate &s;urrender of the city.
<PB N="7" REF="038563_0006_10126C17540D7410">
Hezekiah, having made every proper pre|paration for defence, encouraged the people to tru&s;t in the Lord, &s;aying, "There be more with us than with them: with them is an arm of fle&s;h; but with us is the Lord our God to help us, and to fight our battles." The re&s;ult was, that the angel of the Lord de&s;troyed in one night, one hundred and eighty-five thou&s;and of the A&s;&s;yrian army. Thus their deliverance was accompli&s;hed, by a miraculous interpo&s;i|tion of Heaven. Surrounding nations looked up to Hezekiah with a&s;toni&s;hment, and courted the &s;avour of the prince whom God thus de|lighted to honour.</P>
<P>When he was pre&s;&s;ed with difficulties, he &s;ought the Lord; and having obtained deliver|ance, he gave him glory.</P>
<P>That Hezekiah &s;hould have been &s;o good a man, and &s;o excellent a prince, is matter of &s;ur|pri&s;e when we con&s;ider, that he came to the throne about the age of twenty-five; when the pa&s;&s;ions are in all their vigour, and temptations to vice numerous and powerful. But he was God's cho&s;en in&s;trument to deliver the people, and to make them happy. He therefore fitted him for the &s;ervice, and pre&s;erved him till it was fini&s;hed. His talents, his virtue, and his un&s;peakable importance to the nation, could
<PB N="8" REF="038563_0007_10126C1BB2B9A438">
not &s;ecure him from the arre&s;t of death. "And Hezekiah &s;lept with his fathers, and they buri|ed him in the chiefe&s;t of the &s;epulchres of the &s;ons of David; and all Judah and the inhabit|ants of Jeru&s;alem did him honour at his death."</P>
<P>The text naturally leads us to ob&s;erve,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. That men the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed, belov|ed, and u&s;eful to &s;ociety, mu&s;t die. And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. That a grateful and affectionate people will do them honour at their death.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I. Men the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed, beloved, and u&s;eful to &s;ociety, mu&s;t die.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome men whom we are ready to wi&s;h, might live forever, becau&s;e we cannot &s;ee how their place will be &s;upplied. But we forget that God hath all gifts in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; that the univer&s;e is his kingdom, which he governs with infinite wi&s;dom, and hath made ample provi&s;ion for a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of proper char|acters in all its various departments.</P>
<P>When Mo&s;es had completed his &s;cene of &s;er|vice, he fell on &s;leep, but was &s;ucceeded by a cloud of worthies, whom it is not nece&s;&s;ary to mention. And thus it will be in all future ages of the world. "In&s;tead of the fathers &s;hall be thy children," &s;aid David, "whom I will make
<PB N="9" REF="038563_0008_10126C1EF2678C98">
princes in the earth." Such is the divine ar|rangement, &s;uch the all-perfect plan of Provi|dence&mdash;"Alleluia, for the Lord God omnipo|tent reigneth." This important truth is the &s;ource of our con&s;olation in the day of afflic|tion, but by no means &s;uper&s;edes generous and deep-felt &s;orrow, when great and good men fall.</P>
<P>Our late excellent Governor SUMNER lives in the affections of his fellow-citizens. To his tomb we lately followed his remains with eve|ry mark of high e&s;teem, and deep affliction; and daily lament his early exit. He &s;leeps with his fathers, and lies covered with the clods of the valley. And before the days of our mourning for him are ended, a new &s;ource of <HI>univer&s;al</HI> &s;orrow opens upon us. What mean the&s;e en&s;igns of mortality?&mdash;Why is every countenance &s;ad?&mdash;Why weep <HI>all</HI> the peo|ple?&mdash;Becau&s;e our beloved WASHINGTON is dead! He now lies confined in a &s;mall and dreary apartment, on the banks of the Potow|mack. Thither will many of his fellow-citi|zens in future time re&s;ort, to &s;ee the place that contains his precious du&s;t, and bedew it with their tears; &s;aying, "Here lies WASHING|TON&mdash;My father, my father, the chariots of I&s;rael and the hor&s;emen thereof&mdash;How is the mighty fallen." Death <HI>&s;uddenly</HI> &s;eized him as
<PB N="10" REF="038563_0009_10126C224023E380">
his riche&s;t prey, and hath thereby taught us this awful le&s;&s;on, that "there is no di&s;charge in this war."</P>
<P>Though dead, my brethren, he &s;peaketh to us by his <HI>private,</HI> and his <HI>public</HI> life.</P>
<P>But what &s;hall I &s;ay when &s;o <HI>much</HI> is to be &s;aid? Or what leave un&s;aid without being <HI>unju&s;t</HI> to WASHINGTON? The uncommon excel|lencies of his character, check my feeble effort; much rather would I "in expre&s;&s;ive &s;ilence mu&s;e his prai&s;e." But duty calls me to attempt the unequal ta&s;k, per&s;uaded that your candour and warm affection for our departed friend, will cover every fault.</P>
<P>General WASHINGTON was born the 11th of February, 1732. "His education was &s;uch as favoured the production of a &s;olid mind and a vigorous body. Mountain air, abundant exer|ci&s;e in the open country, the whole&s;ome toils of the chace, and the delightful &s;cenes of rural life, expanded his limbs to an unu&s;ual, but graceful and well-proportioned &s;ize. His youth was &s;pent in the acqui&s;ition of u&s;eful knowledge, and in pur&s;uits tending to the improvement of his fortune, or the benefit of his country."</P>
<P>The uniform account we have had of his <HI>pri|vate</HI> life, is, that he was fond of rural retire|ment,
<PB N="11" REF="038563_0010_10126C23DDE8DC40">
affectionate to his connexions, kind to his &s;ervants, conde&s;cending to his neighbours, and liberal to the poor. The mo&s;t unequivo|cal proof that he was amiable and beloved in his private character, we have in the <HI>early</HI> pub|lic honours that were conferred on him by his country; which commenced when he was about twenty years of age, and continued till his death. There is one evidence of his pri|vate character, which I am unwilling to pa&s;s by; and which I am per&s;uaded will plea&s;e you in the recital.</P>
<P>When he was about to leave Mount Vernon, and again engage in public life, being cho&s;en to the pre&s;idency of the United States, the Mayor of Alexandria, in the name of the people, addre&s;&s;ed him in the following affectionate manner&mdash;"Again your country commands your care. Obedient to its wi&s;hes, unmindful of your ea&s;e, we &s;ee you again relinqui&s;hing the bli&s;s of retirement; and this too at a period of life when nature it&s;elf &s;eems to authori&s;e a pref|erence of repo&s;e.</P>
<P>"Not to extol you as a &s;oldier; not to pour forth our gratitude for pa&s;t &s;ervices; not to ac|knowledge the ju&s;tice of the unexampled honour which has been conferred upon you, by the
<PB N="12" REF="038563_0011_10126C268A8AAF48">
&s;pontaneous and unanimous &s;uffrages of three millions of freemen, in your election to the Chief Magi&s;tracy; nor to admire the patrioti&s;m which directs your conduct, do your <HI>neighbours</HI> and <HI>friends</HI> now addre&s;s you; themes le&s;s &s;plen|did but more endearing impre&s;s our minds. The fir&s;t and be&s;t of citizens mu&s;t leave us; our aged mu&s;t lo&s;e their ornament; our youth their model; our agriculture its improver; our commerce its friend; our infant academy its protector; our poor their benefactor; and the interior navigation of the Potowmack (an event replete with the mo&s;t exten&s;ive utility, already, by your unremitted exertions, brought into par|tial u&s;e) its in&s;titutor and promoter.</P>
<P>"Farewel! go! and make a grateful peo|ple happy; a people who will be doubly grate|ful when they contemplate this recent &s;acrifice for their intere&s;t.</P>
<P>"To that Being who maketh and unmaketh at his will we commend you; and after the accompli&s;hment of the arduous bu&s;ine&s;s to which you are called, may he re&s;tore to us again, the be&s;t of men, and the mo&s;t beloved fellow-citizen."</P>
<P>His <HI>religious</HI> character will be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the view of every candid mind by the tenor of
<PB N="13" REF="038563_0012_10126C2980BE0C58">
his life; provided the tree is to be known by the fruit.</P>
<P>He was a member of the Epi&s;copal Church, con&s;equently a believer in Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>In his public acts we have repeated evidence of his reverence for Deity, and dependence on his Providence. After the conclu&s;ion of the war, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of peace, he re&s;igned his commi&s;&s;ion to Congre&s;s; and &s;ays, among other excellent things, "The &s;ucce&s;sful termi|nation of the war has verified the mo&s;t &s;an|guine expectations, and my gratitude for the interpo&s;ition of Providence, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance I have received from my countrymen, increa&s;es with every review of the momentous &s;ubject. I con&s;ider it as an indi&s;pen&s;able duty to clo&s;e this la&s;t &s;olemn act of my official life, by com|mending the intere&s;ts of my deare&s;t country to the protection of Almighty God, and tho&s;e who have the &s;uperintendence of them to his holy keeping." Thus prays our great military Chief; may &s;oldiers of every de&s;cription go and do likewi&s;e!</P>
<P>We have another plea&s;ing in&s;tance of his rev|erence for Almighty God, in his addre&s;s to the Senate and Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, on his ac|ceptance of his election to the pre&s;idency of the
<PB N="14" REF="038563_0013_10126C2DEB7F5488">
United States. Having expre&s;&s;ed his feelings on this renewed evidence of the approbation of his countrymen, he &s;ays, "Such being the im|pre&s;&s;ions under which I have, in obedience to the public &s;ummons, repaired to the pre&s;ent &s;ta|tion; it would be peculiarly improper to omit, in this fir&s;t official act, my fervent &s;upplications to that Almighty Being, who rules over the uni|ver&s;e&mdash;who pre&s;ides in the councils of na|tions&mdash;and who&s;e providential aids can &s;upply every human defect&mdash;that his benediction may con&s;ecrate to the liberties and happine&s;s of the United States, a government in&s;tituted by them|&s;elves for the&s;e e&s;&s;ential purpo&s;es; and may en|able every in&s;trument employed in its admini&s;|tration, to execute with &s;ucce&s;s, the functions allotted to his charge. In tendering this hom|age to the great Author of every public and private good, I a&s;&s;ure my&s;elf, that it expre&s;&s;es your &s;entiments not le&s;s than my own; nor tho&s;e of my fellow-citizens at large le&s;s than either."</P>
<P>As every thing that was &s;aid by WASHING|TON is delightful to an American audience, I will not he&s;itate to make one more copious ex|tract, that will both enrich the di&s;cour&s;e, and prove him to be the warm friend of religion. This you will find in his la&s;t addre&s;s to the peo|ple
<PB N="15" REF="038563_0014_10126C30431185C0">
of the United States; which de&s;erves to be written in letters of gold; and will undoubted|ly be handed down from generation to genera|tion, till time &s;hall be no more.</P>
<P>"Of all the di&s;po&s;itions and habits which lead to political pro&s;perity, <HI>religion</HI> and <HI>morality</HI> are indi&s;pen&s;able &s;upports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patrioti&s;m, who would labour to &s;ubvert the&s;e great pillars of human happine&s;s, the&s;e firme&s;t props of the duty of men and citizens. The mere <HI>politician,</HI> equally with the <HI>pious</HI> man, ought to re&s;pect and cheri&s;h them. A volume could not trace all their con|nexions with public and private felicity. Let us &s;imply a&s;k, Where is the &s;ecurity for proper|ty, for reputation, for life, if the &s;en&s;e of religi|ous obligation de&s;ert the oaths, which are the in&s;truments of inve&s;tigation in courts of ju&s;tice? Let us with caution indulge the &s;uppo&s;ition, that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded of the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar &s;tructure; rea&s;on and experience both forbid us to expect, that national morality can prevail in exclu&s;ion of religious principle."</P>
<P>I add, that we have been often informed, that he was a devout ob&s;erver of the Lord's Day and the in&s;titutions of religion.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="038563_0015_10126C335FDC6710">
It would require a volume to do ju&s;tice to his character as a <HI>soldier.</HI> He early di&s;covered that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great military talents. In 1755, being then but twenty-three years of age, he bore a Colonel's commi&s;&s;ion, and was with the unfortunate Gen. Braddock when he was de|feated; which &s;ad event might in all probabil|ity have been prevented, had the wi&s;h of our young hero been complied with, of preceding the main army, and &s;couring the woods with his rangers. After their defeat, he was of un|&s;peakable &s;ervice to them, in &s;ecuring their re|treat.</P>
<P>He was not influenced by a &s;pirit of ambi|tion or revenge&mdash;He fought not for fame, but freedom. When he &s;aw the liberties of his country in danger, at the call of his fellow-citi|zens, he &s;tepped forth to defend them. He was the friend and the protector of mankind. Cool, brave and per&s;evering; and when &s;urrounded with difficulties, always found a re&s;ource in his own great mind. Witne&s;s his forlorn condition in 1776, when he fled before the Briti&s;h army through the Jer&s;eys, with only a handful of men, in want of almo&s;t every thing, di&s;courag|ed and worn down. In this critical &s;ituation, when all that is dear to America depended, un|der
<PB N="17" REF="038563_0016_10126C37A6111248">
God, on the exertion of the moment, behold our beloved WASHINGTON&mdash;He plans with judgment, and, &s;upported by his few brave troops, executes with boldne&s;s and promptitude a mo&s;t dangerous but &s;ucce&s;sful enterprize; by which he rai&s;ed the &s;pirits of his dejected coun|trymen, and re&s;cued a great part of New Jer&s;ey from their enemies. The circum&s;tances of this brilliant part of his hi&s;tory you will at once re|collect.</P>
<Q><L>"As night to &s;tars, wo lu&s;tre gives to man."</L></Q>
<P>I &s;hall take leave of his military character for the pre&s;ent, by reminding you, that when the great objects of the American war were obtain|ed, he re&s;igned his commi&s;&s;ion to Congre&s;s, and retired to the private walks of life. It is really &s;urpri&s;ing, becau&s;e uncommon, that a man who had been for &s;everal years in the habit of com|manding armies, could with &s;uch ea&s;e exchange the <HI>&s;oldier</HI> for the <HI>citizen.</HI> In this, as in every other part of his conduct, he di&s;covered the greatne&s;s of his mind, and the benevolence of his heart.</P>
<P>But this part of his hi&s;tory will come with more propriety from the hi&s;torian than the preacher.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="038563_0017_10126C3A81F9CC60">
After a &s;hort period of retirement from the anxiety and fatigues of military life, his country call on him to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the formation of a Con|&s;titution of Government for the United States. Sen&s;ible of the importance of an energetic govern|ment, he accepted their choice; not con&s;ulting his own inclination, but the voice of his fellow citi|zens and the public good. When the delegates from the &s;everal States had met, they cho&s;e him Pre&s;ident of the Convention; on which occa|&s;ion he pre&s;ided with his u&s;ual dignity and &s;pi|rit of conciliation. And when that excellent in&s;trument was fini&s;hed, which bears his name in front of the names of his worthy compatriots; which hath been the means of rai&s;ing our coun|try to its pre&s;ent condition of re&s;pectability and opulence, he again retired to Mount Vernon. But now all eyes are fixed on him as the mo&s;t proper per&s;on to pre&s;ide over the Union. The united voice of three millions of citizens he could not with&s;tand. His &s;entiments and feelings on this occa&s;ion, are excellently expre&s;&s;ed in the fol|lowing an&s;wer to the addre&s;s of the mayor and people of Alexandria, when he was about to repair to the &s;eat of government.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="038563_0018_10126C3CC2D8C668">
GENTLEMEN,</P>
<P>"ALTHOUGH I ought not to conceal, yet I cannot de&s;cribe the painful emotions which I felt in being called upon to determine whether I would accept or refu&s;e the pre&s;idency of the United States. The unanimity in the choice, the opinion of my friends, communicated from different parts of Europe, as well as from Amer|ica, the apparent wi&s;h of tho&s;e who were not entirely &s;atisfied with the con&s;titution in its pre|&s;ent form; and an ardent de&s;ire on my part to be in&s;trumental in connecting the good will of my countrymen towards each other; have in|duced an acceptance. Tho&s;e who know me be&s;t (and you, my fellow-citizens, are from your &s;ituation, in that number) know better than any others, my love of retirement is &s;o great, that no earthly con&s;ideration, &s;hort of a conviction of duty, could have prevailed upon me to depart from my re&s;olution, never more to take any &s;hare in tran&s;actions of a public nature. For at my age and in my circum&s;tances, what pro&s;|pects or advantages could I propo&s;e to my&s;elf, for embarking again on the tempe&s;tuous and uncertain ocean of public life?"</P>
<P>This repeated &s;acrifice of his dome&s;tic ea&s;e and happine&s;s to the voice of the people, drew
<PB N="20" REF="038563_0019_10126C414DD7E260">
from them new and ardent expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude and love to him. Various parts of the country through which he pa&s;&s;ed to the &s;eat of govern|ment, were crowded with citizens of every de|&s;cription, who di&s;covered &s;uch a de&s;ire to &s;ee the Man, to whom they owed &s;o much, as greatly affected him, and cau&s;ed him to weep.</P>
<P>His fir&s;t interview with Congre&s;s on his ar|rival at New-York, was &s;olemn and intere&s;ting. To the hi&s;tory of that day I refer you, becau&s;e no abridgment of its tran&s;actions can be admit|ted without injury.</P>
<P>Eight years he filled that exalted and arduous &s;tation, with honour to him&s;elf and great advan|tage to his country; con&s;tantly pur&s;uing her be&s;t intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>When the time drew near that a choice was to be made of Pre&s;ident of the United States, he declined being con&s;idered as a candidate. This determination deeply affected his country|men. But con&s;idering his time of life, and that he had devoted forty-five years of it already to their &s;ervice, they could not urge him to re|linqui&s;h it.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion, I can only &s;ay, that it was WASHINGTON: a name, which in all future
<PB N="21" REF="038563_0020_10126C42EAD1A798">
ages ought to be con&s;idered as a <HI>general term,</HI> including every thing great and excellent in the human character. Behold this man, admired by a world; of his own accord de&s;cending from his high &s;tation of THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, to become the far|mer of Mount Vernon&mdash;the private citizen: which introduces the la&s;t &s;olemn &s;cene.</P>
<P>On Friday the 13th in&s;t, he appeared to have taken a cold, which principally affected his throat; of which he made but little complaint. About three o'clock on Saturday morning his di&s;ea&s;e became alarming: phy&s;icians were &s;ent for, but they came too late. Heaven's great decree had pa&s;&s;ed, that WASHINGTON &s;hould die. "This la&s;t &s;cene corre&s;ponded with the whole tenor of his life. Not a groan nor a complaint e&s;caped him, though in extreme di&s;|tre&s;s. With perfect re&s;ignation, and a full po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of his rea&s;on, he clo&s;ed his well &s;pent life."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Lear's Letter.</NOTE> Death to him was an enemy di&s;armed.</P>
<P>We &s;incerely &s;ympathize with the di&s;con&s;o|late widow, and wi&s;h her every divine con&s;o|lation under her irreparable lo&s;s. But &s;he &s;or|rows not as they who have no hope. The im|mortal &s;pirit of that excellent man, the partner

of her life, who hath left a nation in tears, hath, we tru&s;t, a&s;cended to an infinitely better world, to receive the rewards of a good and faithful &s;ervant;</P>
<P>II. While an affectionate and grateful people do him honour at his death.</P>
<P>The moment the melancholy news arrived, that our beloved Chief was dead, every coun|tenance was &s;ad&mdash;bu&s;ine&s;s was &s;u&s;pended&mdash;and tears flowed from eyes not u&s;ed to weep.&mdash;All the people felt alike. The&s;e artle&s;s effu&s;ions of the heart are far more honourable than the &s;culptured monument, or mo&s;t elegant panegy|ric. But as &s;ucceeding generations will not feel as we do, who know the man, let us per|petuate his memory by every proper method. Let us impre&s;s on the minds of our children and youth a &s;en&s;e of the virtues and talents of WASHINGTON, and urge them to go and do likewi&s;e. Let the faithful hi&s;torian tran&s;mit to generations yet unborn, his private and his pub|lic character. Let men who occupy the high|e&s;t offices of government not only <HI>applaud,</HI> but <HI>imitate</HI> his virtues. For even kings may learn from him what mode of conduct to pur|&s;ue

to make the people happy, and live in their affections.</P>
<P>But I leave this matter to my afflicted fel|low-citizens, who will, with one &s;oul, devi&s;e the be&s;t method of doing la&s;ting honour to his memory.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject &s;ugge&s;ts a variety of u&s;eful re|flections.</P>
<P N="1">1. If the man who&s;e death we now deplore, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;o many excellencies, as the united voice of his countrymen and of foreigners a&s;|&s;cribe to him, I a&s;k, Whence were they deriv|ed? Certainly from the Father of lights, from whom cometh down every good and every perfect gift. If then &s;uch are the &s;treams, what mu&s;t the fountain be? If the per&s;onal excellen|cies of a man can attract the admiration of a nation, how ought we to be &s;wallowed up in love and adoration of that God, in whom dwells e&s;&s;entially every po&s;&s;ible perfection!</P>
<P>Permit me al&s;o to inquire, how it happens, that a people feelingly alive to excellence of char|acter, &s;hould &s;o generally forget our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is the brightne&s;s of the Father's glory, and expre&s;s image of his per&s;on: in whom dwells all the fulne&s;s of the Godhead bodily. Who hath left us in his life a mo&s;t
<PB N="24" REF="038563_0023_10126C4EFA109BD8">
perfect example of every thing amiable and prai&s;e-worthy; and by his one offering hath perfected for ever all them who are &s;anctified. He is infinite in excellence, and abundant in grace and goodne&s;s: yet to crowds he ap|pears without form or comeline&s;s. This awful evidence of human depravity we bewail.</P>
<P N="2">2. That &s;olemn in&s;tance of death which now arre&s;ts our attention, is a loud call to all, e&s;pe|cially to the rulers of the people, to be always ready, becau&s;e they know not the day nor the hour when the Son of Man will come. They hence learn that they are to die like men, and fall like one of the princes. Death will &s;oon level all di&s;tinctions, and after death the judg|ment; when Jehovah will render to every man according to his works. It becomes us all to entertain a lively &s;en&s;e of that awful period, when God will judge the &s;ecrets of men by Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and to be prepared for it, that we may give up our account with joy, and not with grief.</P>
<P>In fine&mdash;We are under every obligation to mingle thank&s;givings to God, with the &s;orrows of the occa&s;ion, becau&s;e a life &s;o important to our country hath been &s;pared &s;o long. A kind

Providence lent us a WASHINGTON&mdash;fitted him for the various and arduous &s;ervices in which he was employed&mdash;covered his head in the day of battle&mdash;pre&s;erved him amid&s;t innu|merable dangers, till the great affairs of our country, civil and military, were happily arrang|ed. Till this period, he was immortal. How|ever much we feel our lo&s;s, we ble&s;s the Lord that he did not fall before. His work was done; and he hath come to his grave in a full age, like as a &s;hock of corn cometh in, in his &s;ea&s;on. He hath pa&s;&s;ed through life and de|&s;cended to his grave with <HI>un&s;ought, un&s;ullied</HI> honours.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome men who are always in eager pur&s;uit of fame, from whom &s;he keeps a cautious di&s;tance: not &s;o WASHINGTON. With full &s;pread pinions &s;he pur&s;ued him all his life, &s;olicit|ous to be&s;tow on him tho&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed re|wards which were due to his uncommon merit, which he received with that mode&s;ty and diffi|dence in him&s;elf, that were peculiar to a mind like his. And at this moment, while &s;ilent in the tomb, a nation is engaged to do him honour.&mdash;Surpri&s;ing man!&mdash;</P>
<P>But we leave for a moment the tomb of our much loved friend, to offer prai&s;e to
<PB N="26" REF="038563_0025_10126C54A951E568">
Almighty God, for the many promi&s;ing and u&s;eful characters that ri&s;e before us: e&s;pecially that ADAMS yet lives to &s;erve his country. May the Lord long pre&s;erve and ble&s;s him, and think on him for good, according to all that he hath done for this people.</P>
