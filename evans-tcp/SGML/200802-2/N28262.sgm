<P>IN obedience to tho&s;e feelings which are ever excited in the human heart, at the lo&s;s of a friend, a benefactor and a father; we are now a&s;|&s;embled, to pay our la&s;t public tribute of affection and veneration, to the memory of our beloved WASHINGTON. And I doubt not, but upon this occa&s;ion, we &s;hall give free indulgence, to that voluntary &s;ympathy, which is &s;o rapidly &s;pread|ing, from heart to heart, throughout the continent of America, and will as &s;oon as the &s;ad tidings reach the tran&s;-atlantic &s;hores, wrap even Europe in a &s;able mantle. For when virtue expires, na|ture receives a &s;hock, and the plaintive moan is echoed through the world! I apprehend how|ever, fellow citizens, that it will not be expected
<PB N="10" REF="037666_0010_100F35F233815D20">
from me, that I attempt to pourtray the charac|ter of our virtuous chief; for that ta&s;k is too im|portant, and &s;ublime for me to undertake. Let it therefore &s;uffice, if I make a few remarks, on the propriety of the &s;olemn pomp now before us; and point out a few of tho&s;e general traits, in the character of our venerable decea&s;ed, which &s;eem|ed to rai&s;e him aloof from his fellow men, and &s;hed an unknown dignity and lu&s;tre on the hu|man race.</P>
<P>IN touching on the character of the decea&s;ed, I &s;hall confine my&s;elf merely to a comparative view of him, with others who have been emi|nently di&s;tingui&s;hed in the world. And altho' I &s;hould be unwilling to tarni&s;h the glory of any man, which has been fairly and honourably ac|quired; whether he be living in hi&s;tory only, or is now active on the &s;tage of life; yet I deem it no robbery or diminution of their glory, to &s;ay they all fade in the compari&s;on. All other great characters of which we have any knowledge, have been di&s;tingui&s;hed for &s;ome one, extraordinary talent or virtue, which has given them celebrity and fame, when compared with common men. Of this cla&s;s hi&s;tory, and many living characters, afford us numerous examples, and at the lo&s;s of
<PB N="11" REF="037666_0011_100F35F6875F8ED8">
the&s;e ornaments of &s;ociety there will ever be a partial mourning, for they are valuable and im|portant in &s;ociety&mdash;perhaps a nation may deplore the lo&s;s of a great general, coun&s;ellor or judge: &s;cience may lo&s;e an able &s;upporter, and a liberal patron: religion may lament the lo&s;s of a pious and a virtuous man, nay a doctor deep &s;killed in the &s;cience of theology: or even the humble walks of life, may lo&s;e a kind friend and bounti|ful benefactor: yet the grief in all the&s;e in&s;tances is limited, for their talents and their virtues are circum&s;cribed.</P>
<P>BUT never until the time of WASHINGTON, has a character appeared &s;o richly adorned, with all the great and noble virtues of which humanity is &s;u&s;ceptible. He is not like other heroes, &s;ages or patriots, who&s;e names are enrolled in the book of fame; for no hi&s;tory can poli&s;h his glory, and even malign cen&s;ure, dare not pluck a &s;prig from his well earned laurels. Heaven &s;eemed to have formed the man WASHINGTON, out of its choice&s;t materials, and robbed, as it were, humanity of its virtues to form one perfect man. Being thus en|dowed with &s;uperlative virtues and talents, he was introduced, on the &s;tage of life, and a&s;&s;igned a part in a &s;cene which had never before been acted
<PB N="12" REF="037666_0012_100F35F8CC129F38">
in the the nations of the earth. Pa&s;&s;ing over the earlier parts of his life, let us view him at that important cri&s;is, when he managed the &s;ublime and happy conflict between an infant, weak and inexperienced nation, and a haughty, imperious and overbearing kingdom! Armed with that panoply, which Jehovah had made for him, bold in the cau&s;e of ju&s;tice, and &s;ecure in the &s;miles of his God, like David, though a &s;tripling in the arts of war, he baffled the Goliahs of Great Britain, and led in triumph her armies, at his chariot wheels. Even amid&s;t the dangers which for &s;even bloody years, marred the peace and felicity of the American people; behold the virtuous chieftain conducting the infant America, through perils and dangers before unknown. And through all this &s;truggle which gave birth to America, &s;elf-compo&s;ed and collected, his active and pervading mind, could, even in the greate&s;t difficulties re&s;ort to avenues of prudence and &s;afety. Even at that awful moment when Providence &s;eemed to have withdrawn his protecting hand! at that dark hour, when de&s;pair had &s;eized the American bo&s;om; when the eagle of our country drooped its extended wings in token of grief! Say ye pa|triots, who had the honor of fighting under his banners, did his dignity le&s;&s;en? did his valour and wi&s;dom appear le&s;s active and &s;ublime, than
<PB N="13" REF="037666_0013_100F35FA5AF62538">
when &s;ucce&s;s danced on his helmet, and gli&s;tened on his &s;word? Your an&s;wer is no&mdash;for with a fortitude and equanimity, peculiar to him&s;elf, he met danger undi&s;mayed, and &s;oared above the ad|ver&s;ities of life&mdash;Nay more, that firmne&s;s, temper|ance and maje&s;ty, which uniformly di&s;tingui&s;hed him, became more con&s;picuous in the hour of dif|culty and di&s;tre&s;s. Nor was this mighty man like other great men, elated with &s;ucce&s;s; but his keen mind, reviewing the pa&s;t and fore&s;eeing the future, made him calm and tranquil, even in his glory; and ever di&s;played &s;uch a dignified maje&s;ty as a&s;&s;imu|lated him more to the gods, than mortal man. Thus by his wi&s;dom, having protected the infan|cy of his country, and &s;upported her by his &s;ingle arm; having trained up a numerous ho&s;t of hardy and well di&s;ciplined &s;oldiers to be her future bul|wark, and ratified the birth and independence of his country; behold the re&s;plendent virtues, at|tend him to the mild and peaceful walks of pri|vate life! And here let me a&s;k, where is the man, WASHINGTON excepted, who with the &s;ame opportunities, would not have derived &s;ome per|&s;onal advantages to him&s;elf? who would not have acquired wealth? or perhaps by force of tho&s;e armies which at the clo&s;e of the la&s;t war, were devoted to his name and per&s;on, would have
<PB N="14" REF="037666_0014_100F24B9332A4FF8">
e&s;tabli&s;hed him&s;elf lord paramount of the country he &s;aved? This our hero &s;purned; having de|voted him&s;elf to the cau&s;e of ju&s;tice, having re&s;|cued a &s;inking nation, the great object of his heart being accompli&s;hed; he retired to the &s;e|que&s;tered vale of life, to enjoy in common with his fellow citizens, that peace and happine&s;s his valor won. Above the reach of mercenary views, beyond the power of adulation, behold him gently &s;ettling on Mount Vernon, like Noah's ark on the mountain of Arrarat, a &s;ure pre&s;age that the &s;torm was o'er.</P>
<P>TOO important however to remain long a private citizen, &s;ee him again &s;tep forth, at the voice of his country to conduct the augu&s;t councils of our nation. See with what alacrity, he again aban|doned the gentle plea&s;ures of dome&s;tic life, to make that people virtuous and happy, whom his valor had made independent.&mdash;Was it glory that again induced him to come forth and guide the devious mazes of our national councils? Surely not, or the experiment was hazardous and uncer|tain, and his laurels were yet blooming with their fre&s;he&s;t verdure&mdash;Was it the de&s;ire of wealth, which prompted him to obey the &s;econd call of his country? No; for he had uniformly declined
<PB N="15" REF="037666_0015_100F35FE12315558" MS="y">
accepting any compen&s;ation&mdash;But it was that &s;ame virtue, which at fir&s;t made him ri&s;que his life in the cau&s;e of freedom and ju&s;tice, which influenced him to accept the chair of &s;tate, and conduct his beloved nation to happine&s;s and honor&mdash;and when he had firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed a government, which was calculated to en&s;ure and perpetuate national felicity; having given the fir&s;t example that true liberty is compatible with government and law, he again with redoubled lu&s;tre retired from public cares; having left a benizon to that people, whom he had fo&s;tered in infancy, and in&s;tructed in manhood. And here it would &s;eem that his public career mu&s;t end&mdash;and it would my friends, had not this godlike man, even in the wane of life, at a period, when by the common laws of nature, ambition &s;lumbers, and happine&s;s is ultimately blended, with quietude and ea&s;e, at the remote appearance of ho&s;tilities, to the coun|try he loved, once more &s;tepped forth, and gra&s;ped the &s;word of his earlier days to in&s;pire millions and deter the foe. Here then behold a climax of glory, honor and reputation, which the deeds of four thou&s;and years, has never equalled! At la&s;t perfectly compo&s;ed, and prepared for the event, he is tran&s;lated in a moment, from this
<PB N="16" REF="037666_0016_100F3601EB81B200">
earth, to the bo&s;om of his God, ready to give a full account of tho&s;e talents committed to his charge, and receive the meed of a well &s;pent life, accompanied, with well done thou good and faith|ful &s;ervant.</P>
<P>YES, fellow citizens he is no more! His body now &s;lumbers in the dark chambers of death! his &s;hield is broken! his &s;word fallen from that once nervous arm! That voice which once commanded the li&s;tening attention of the &s;enate, is &s;ilent! yet his name &s;tands written at full length in the volume of fame, and will continue &s;o long as na|ture endures, the fir&s;t of heroes, patriots, &s;ages! and his virtues &s;till live, and will ever continue to live, in the memory of an affectionate and grateful people.</P>
<P>HOW becoming is it then in us, to pay all due honors to his memory&mdash;we all <HI>feel</HI> as though we had <HI>&s;een</HI> him&mdash;we know him as our earthly father; e&s;teemed him as our friend, and revered him as our protector&mdash;we were of his family&mdash;for he re|cognized us as his children; and nothing but un|bounded parental affection, could have induced him to have undergone the fatigues and dangers which he did, to promote our happine&s;s and &s;ecure our
<PB N="17" REF="037666_0017_100F360380AF6270">
&s;afety. The emblems of grief, which are now exhib|ited before us; the deep toned thunder of cannon which are now proclaiming the &s;ad tidings! The drooping &s;tandards, which once waved in triumph round his head&mdash;the &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion, which is the la&s;t kind office we can afford the dead! All, ought to in&s;pire us with manly &s;orrow, and im|pre&s;s our hearts with grief; for while the United States are &s;ympathi&s;ing in &s;orrow, at the general lo&s;s, were we to refrain, would be paying an ill compliment to our own virtue, humanity and gratitude.</P>
<P>BUT, my countrymen let us not de&s;pair&mdash;for altho' WASHINGTON is vi&s;ibly departed from us; yet his &s;pirit, &s;hall hover over the city which bears his immortal name, and henceforth be the Guardian Genius of the&s;e United States! And may it ever in&s;pire future patriots with the &s;ame virtue, in|tegrity, and honor, which &s;o eminently character|i&s;ed his whole life.</P>
