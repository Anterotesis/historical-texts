<P>And it came to pa&s;s, after the&s;e things, that Jo&s;hua, the &s;on of Nun, the &s;ervant of the Lord, died.</P></Q>

<P>THE birth of an empire to independence and &s;overeignty is, to the whole world, an inter|e&s;ting event; intere&s;ting in proportion to the prob|able extent of its future connexions, and the ef|fects this event and the&s;e connexions will produce, in di&s;tant climates and remote periods of time.&mdash; Few nations, if any, ju&s;tly appreciating the unal|ienable rights of human nature, or even their &s;elf-intere&s;t, can &s;it unconcerned &s;pectators of the mighty &s;truggle for liberty, in which her votaries and children are called, from time to time, to en|gage. Ever &s;ince the di&s;covery of America, its af|fairs have deeply claimed the attention and been the &s;ubjects of the policy of the kingdoms of Europe. It needed no more than human wi&s;dom to fore&s;ee that the va&s;t increa&s;e of population, and acce&s;s to the hidden &s;tores of nature, in a new world, would excite an univer&s;al &s;pirit of enterprize, enlarge the boundaries of &s;cience, and expand, to a much broader extent, the wings of active and enriching commerce.&mdash;Actuated by the&s;e views, various nations early made colonial e&s;tabli&s;hments in the newly-di&s;covered country, which, tho not imme|diately
<PB N="6" REF="037353_0004_100CBE6D4EEA2D20">
lucrative, promi&s;ed, at a future period, per|manent and exten&s;ive advantages. Mutual jeal|ou&s;y between the &s;overeigns who claimed the right of &s;oil, from di&s;covery or conque&s;t, and from who&s;e dominions &s;ettlers emigrated to the&s;e di&s;tant regions, &s;oon aro&s;e, and a de&s;ire to protect and ad|vance the welfare of their infant colonies proved the &s;ource of rancorous and bloody wars.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h &s;ettlements in North-America were exten&s;ive, and &s;o happily &s;ituated that they flour|i&s;hed to a degree far &s;urpa&s;&s;ing tho&s;e of any other nation. They pre&s;ented a wide and inviting pro&s;|pect for emigration and commerce, and &s;treams of opulence, which would naturally increa&s;e with the progre&s;s made in the cultivation of the wilderne&s;s, flowed back and enriched the native country. That they would, at &s;ome period, arrive to manhood, a&s;&s;ert their rights and break by violence, the &s;hackles of foreign oppre&s;&s;ion, was perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the natural cour&s;e of human affairs, and early pre|dicted.</P>
<P>A fundamental error in the principle of parlia|mentary legi&s;lation and a &s;y&s;tem per&s;everingly main|tained by the Briti&s;h government evidently calcu|lated to cramp the genius, repre&s;s the enterprize, and drain the wealth of the coloni&s;ts, prepared the American mind for the au&s;picious event. Every per&s;on of di&s;cernment contemplated the conte&s;t as violent, requiring an immen&s;e &s;acrifice of blood and trea&s;ure; but the object was of &s;uch va&s;t mag|nitude, that no &s;acrifice was thought too great, no price too dear, to obtain and &s;ecure heaven-born liberty.</P>
<P>To accompli&s;h a revolution &s;o grand and impor|tant as that achieved in our country, it was ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary that, in our unorganized &s;tate, &s;ome illu&s;trious character &s;hould be found, who&s;e &s;plendid military talents &s;hould direct the patriotic
<PB N="7" REF="037353_0005_100CBE6F7ACFE498">
ardor and natural energy of his countrymen, and who, by his addre&s;s, &s;hould mould their opinions and conciliate their e&s;teem.&mdash;Then was it that the Divine Director turned the eyes of the guardians of the public welfare to the great, the immortal WASHINGTON.</P>
<P>That we may improve this &s;olemn occa&s;ion to the glory of the living God, and realize the propriety of a national mourning, let us attend to the fol|lowing con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>FIRST. God is the all-wi&s;e Sovereign of the univer&s;e and &s;upreme arbiter of nations.</P>
<P>He is the great Lord over all, the Almighty Ruler of the &s;kies; &s;its enthroned in glory unfad|ing, and crowned with honors everla&s;ting. His kingdom extends to all worlds and all periods, and his dominion will have no end. With &s;way uncon|troled and power irre&s;i&s;tible, He overrules all e|vents on earth. He hath been and will be con|&s;tantly and unalterably, carrying on a grand &s;cheme, in the whole circle of &s;ublunary affairs, for his own glory and the good of his church, from the begin|ning to the end of time. In the ri&s;e and fall of empires and kingdoms, in the mighty revolutions which occur among nations, in the alternate beams of pro&s;perity and clouds of adver&s;ity which they experience, the ALMIGHTY di&s;plays his glorious perfections and high &s;upremacy. Doth a nation ri&s;e to eminence and greatne&s;s, &s;hine in the arts of peace, or prove &s;ucce&s;sful in tho&s;e of war; or is it ca&s;t down from the zenith of opulence and glory, overtaken with &s;ad rever&s;es, and plunged into infa|my and ruin, the Lord hath done it. When ac|cording to the coun&s;els of heaven, great and high|ly intere&s;ting events and revolutions, in the condi|tion and government of a country, are about to be accompli&s;hed, divine wi&s;dom ever introduces upon the theatre of life, &s;uch talents, characters
<PB N="8" REF="037353_0006_100CBE710911A3D8">
and concurrence of circum&s;tances, as are nece&s;&s;a|ry for the completion of the work. Such in&s;tru|ments are prepared for the management of public concerns, that the end de&s;igned will not fail. When the Hebrew tribes were to come up from the land of cruel bondage, MOSES, the &s;ervant of the Lord, was &s;ent, with a divine commi&s;&s;ion, to lead them forth with &s;igns and wonders.&mdash;When the va&s;t con|tinent of America, which for ages, had been em|bo&s;omed in the pathle&s;s ocean, and lain hidden from the view of the civilized world, was to be di&s;covered, COLUMBUS was in&s;pired with an un|conquerable &s;pirit of fore&s;ight and enterprize, with dauntle&s;s fortitude to execute his projected &s;chemes, and explore unknown &s;eas and di&s;tant regions of the earth.&mdash;When the period had arrived that the banners of independence &s;hould be unfurled in the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ed colonies, a new empire be erected on the broad ba&s;is of rational liberty, and the U|nited States, &s;purning the galling yoke of foreign tyranny, &s;hould a&s;&s;ume a name and rank among &s;overeign nations, the ALMIGHTY prepared the il|lu&s;trious WASHINGTON to organize the untutored band and lead the mar&s;halled battalions to the bloody combat. Extraordinary and &s;ingularly em|inent characters, who &s;oar far above the brighte&s;t of their contemporaries, are not often needed to accom|pli&s;h the de&s;igns of Providence. For this end di|vine power, wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s will ever provide fit and adequate in&s;truments; but characters with uncommon talents and extent of capacities are not rai&s;ed up, unle&s;s &s;ome field is opened for their di&s;|play. A &s;econd dignified per&s;onage, tho qualified by the gifts of nature to &s;hine with unrivalled lu&s;|tre, like him who&s;e exit from time, we this day, as a nation, bemoan, will not obtain equal celebrity, until a &s;cene is unfolded for the u&s;eful exhibition of the &s;ame &s;upereminent talents, which rendered him, &s;o ju&s;tly, the glory of his country and the ad|miration of the world.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="037353_0007_100CBE748CB8FD10">Among all nations, whether more barbarous or more poli&s;hed, men of military genius have ob|tained a va&s;t a&s;cendency in the minds, and received high-&s;ounding applau&s;e from the bulk of mankind. The heroic exploits of &s;ignalized commanders have employed the pen of the hi&s;torian, the eloquence of the orator, and the fancy of the poet. Undi&s;|tingui&s;hed prai&s;e however, is by no means, ju&s;t. Unle&s;s directed by moral principle and improved for the good of mankind, eminent talents are aw|fully de&s;tructive of human happine&s;s: Tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s them become the cur&s;e of heaven and the &s;courge of the human race.</P>
<P>The fame of ALEXANDER hath been borne on every wind. Monarchs graced his triumph and exten&s;ive regions owned his &s;overeignty. But what were the benefits re&s;ulting to mankind from his might victories, his exten&s;ive conque&s;ts? He wept that there was not another world to conquer: With much propriety might the world weep at the appearance of another &s;uch conqueror!&mdash;CAE|SAR, at the head of the Roman legions, vanqui&s;h|ed and &s;ubdued the numerous and valiant tribes, which &s;pread over the wide extent of territory be|tween Rome and Britain. What advantage has been derived from the&s;e martial achievements?&mdash; Great warriors have too often been the butchers of their fellowmen; and the eclat which attended them, has been in proportion to the de&s;olating havoc which marked their progre&s;s.</P>
<P>But when a man endowed by nature with an ex|alted genius and evidently formed for great under|takings, applies it uniformly and with its utmo&s;t en|ergy, to the &s;ole benefit of mankind, to the utter exclu&s;ion of the idea of private emolument; when he &s;tands forth the undaunted champion of liberty, inflexibly determined, at the hazard of every thing dear, to redre&s;s the grievances of his coun|try,

rai&s;e her from the du&s;t of foreign pro&s;tration, boldly a&s;&s;ert her rights and maintain her dignity; and, having accompli&s;hed the great object for which his &s;word was drawn, nobly refu&s;ing the re|ward which his toils and &s;acrifices richly de&s;erved, retiring from public &s;cenes and employments, to the peaceful &s;hades of private life; he exhibits a fin|i&s;hed pattern of the Man, the Hero, and the Lover of his country. To him, as an agent in the work of the Lord, ought a tribute of gratitude and prai&s;e to be returned and be&s;towed.</P>
<P N="2">II. God &s;ometimes exerci&s;eth a peculiar provi|dence toward an oppre&s;&s;ed people, and by &s;ignal interpo&s;itions &s;aves them from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and ruin.</P>
<P>The two mo&s;t remarkable in&s;tances, in the an|nals of the world, to verify this ob&s;ervation, are the Jewi&s;h and American nations.&mdash;To re&s;cue the former from under the de&s;potim of Pharaoh, MOSES was e&s;pecially rai&s;ed up, by a peculiar train of circum|&s;tances educated at the Egyptian court, where a fa|vorable opportunity for the improvement of his natural talents was enjoyed; and honored with a commi&s;&s;ion from heaven, in the terrible di&s;play of divine power, to bring them forth from the hou&s;e of bondage. At the red &s;ea JEHOVAH proclaim|ed, by his wonderful acts, his determination to &s;ave his cho&s;en people from the hand and cruelty of the proud oppre&s;&s;or.&mdash;The hi&s;tory of events, from the cata&s;trophe of the red &s;ea to their entrance upon the promi&s;ed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, is replete with wonders.</P>
<P>The &s;upport of between two and three millions of &s;ouls, in a barren de&s;ert, for the &s;pace of forty years, &s;o that their food did not fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l, nor their cloaths wax old, is one of the mo&s;t &s;urprizing and wonder-working providences of which we can po&s;|&s;ibly conceive. The flinty rock mu&s;t gu&s;h with re|fre&s;hing &s;treams, the manna mu&s;t de&s;cend from heaven, and the quails cover the camp, to nouri&s;h and pre&s;erve the I&s;rael of the Lord.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="037353_0009_100CBE784E9110A0">When their heaven-guided march was compleat|ed and the fair inheritance brightened before their eyes, as MOSES, that eminent in&s;trument of divine goodne&s;s to the cho&s;en tribes, was not allowed to go over Jordan, JOSHUA was ordained the organ of divine communication, to lead them to the peacea|ble po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.&mdash;In providing, according to the pe|culiarity of circum&s;tances, &s;uch illu&s;trious charac|ters as MOSES and JOSHUA, furni&s;hing them with &s;uch extraordinary qualifications, and enabling them to perform &s;uch wonderful deeds, we &s;ee &s;pe|cial tokens of the divine pre&s;ence and care.</P>
<P>Clearly manife&s;t and little le&s;s &s;ignal, was the hand of heaven in the American revolution.&mdash;In the conte&s;t which decided the fate of this empire, on the one hand is &s;een entering the field, a nation po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of immen&s;e wealth; an e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;y&s;tem of drawing into effectual energy its ample re&s;our|ces; a fleet which rode in triumph on the ocean, commanded by officers thoroughly &s;killed in naval affairs and in&s;pired with the highe&s;t &s;entiments of honor, and manned with &s;eamen, who were inured to the havoc of death, and who&s;e pul&s;e beat high for the glory of their king and country; an army; trained in all the terrible di&s;cipline of war, formi|dable from its numbers, bold from its &s;ucce&s;s, e|quipt with every nece&s;&s;ary for the camp and the field, and led by Chiefs adorned with laurels gath|ered on the bloody plains of Europe:&mdash;On the other, a nation is beheld, &s;pread over a wide extent of territory, expo&s;ed on either &s;ide to ho&s;tile inva|&s;ion or &s;avage incur&s;ion, without an organized ar|my, or navy, without military &s;tores or military knowledge; without officers to command or &s;old|iers accu&s;tomed to the rigor of &s;evere di&s;cipline and &s;ubordination; de&s;titute of every requi&s;ite for car|rying on a war, and having no general government, to &s;y&s;tematize public affairs and wi&s;ely improve the great advantages which the God of Nature had be|&s;towed
<PB N="12" REF="037353_0010_100CBE79D299EAC8">
upon the country.&mdash;How &s;triking the con|tra&s;t! Calculating on common principles, how va&s;t was the &s;uperiority on the &s;ide of our foes! How awfully portentous the cloud which then gathered over America!&mdash;But the&s;e renowned commanders were captured and the laurels were plucked from their brows, or their prowe&s;s was unavailing; har|dy veterans, by thou&s;ands, invaded our &s;hores, and either enriched our fields with their blood, or yielded to &s;uperior force. Never was Briti&s;h valor more completely foiled! Never was Briti&s;h pride &s;o deeply humbled as in the lo&s;s of two whole armies in &s;o &s;hort a term!&mdash;When the fabric of independ|ence tottered to its ba&s;e, when the &s;anctuary of lib|erty was ready to be demoli&s;hed, when the name of the United States was ready to be blotted out for|ever, and the illu&s;trious characters who adorned the revolution to be branded with eternal infamy, the Supreme Sovereign &s;aid, Let America be free, and America was free. <HI>"If it had not been the Lord who was on our &s;ide, when men ro&s;e up again&s;t us, then they had &s;wallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled again&s;t us. Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, who hath not given us a prey to their teeth."</HI></P>
<P>There was a particular providence in unfolding the &s;cene gradually, in uniting the feelings of a great people in the abhorrence of tyranny, in ren|dering the patriots of America willing to run the mo&s;t imminent hazard of property, of fame and of life, and in having ready a cho&s;en in&s;trument, with &s;ome experience and a profound judgment, to execute the divine purpo&s;e of our political &s;alva|tion.&mdash;The winds, the waves, the ice, and the floods were made to con&s;pire to attain the &s;ame end. In the foreign connexions which we were en|abled to form; in the lively &s;ympathy of a great and magnanimous monarch, &s;ince doomed by pop|ular phrenzy to an untimely fate; in the re&s;pect and obedience paid through the land to a mere

&s;hadow of government, at a time highly favorable for the uncontrollable pa&s;&s;ions of man; in the events of battles; in the almo&s;t miraculous pre&s;er|vation of the invaluable life of our heaven honored Hero, and in numerous con&s;picuous in&s;tances, we trace the &s;pecial interference of the ALMIGHTY in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of our independence and empire.</P>
<P N="3">III. The mo&s;t eminent and exten&s;ive &s;ervices to mankind will not &s;ave from death.</P>
<P>This relentle&s;s and in&s;atiable foe hath triumphed, and will continue to triumph, over the mo&s;t ele|vated morrals. His dominion is e&s;tabli&s;hed over all the race of Adam. The great and the &s;mall, the high and the low, the honorable and the de&s;pi&s;ed, mu&s;t lie down in the grave. MOSES had his ta&s;k a&s;&s;igned him in life, his &s;phere of u&s;efulne&s;s al|lotted. The de&s;igns of heaven in preparing him to act in an extraordinary capacity being accompli&s;hed, he was removed from time. JOSHUA, his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, acted his part on the theatre of life, in leading the children of I&s;rael to the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the conquered country, and then yielded to the mighty de&s;troyer of human kind. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of the mo&s;t affluent, the mo&s;t beloved, the mo&s;t honoured among the &s;ons of men. Name CRAE|SUS, SOLOMON, or any even the mo&s;t renowned princes, "the brighte&s;t ornaments of thrones and of humanity," and it will be found that their earthly career was clo&s;ed by the &s;ame melancholy event. The grim tyrant a&s;&s;aults the &s;plendid pal|ace with equal boldne&s;s and with equal &s;ucce&s;s, as the humble cottage. He is not di&s;mayed by the en|&s;igns of office, the regalia of courts, the elevation of ranks. The&s;e, at a &s;ingle blow, he levels with the du&s;t and buries in undi&s;tingui&s;hed ruin. Death a&s;cends the throne and plunges headlong its high po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or.&mdash;Nay, more than monarchs bow to the fatal &s;troke, for WASHINGTON is fallen!&mdash;Let not the greate&s;t of generals, the mo&s;t eminent of &s;tate&s;|men,
<PB N="14" REF="037353_0012_100CBE7FA4BC4048">
the mo&s;t highly e&s;teemed and mo&s;t dearly be|loved of men, expect to e&s;cape death, for WASH|INGTON is fallen! Let not the man "fir&s;t in war, fir&s;t in peace, and fir&s;t in the hearts of his coun|trymen" hope to avoid the deadly arrow, for WASHINGTON is fallen!&mdash;Since the peerle&s;s trophy obtained on Calvary's mount, have few &s;o &s;plendid, graced the triumph of the king of terrors! O Death! How numerous, how &s;ignal are thy victo|ries! In every age, in every country, in every cli|mate, do&s;t thou di&s;play thy &s;able en&s;igns in &s;olemn pomp! Palaces are in thy dominion and kings are thy &s;ubjects. Thou reigne&s;t in more complete em|pire than the crowned worms of the du&s;t; to-day, they wield a &s;ceptre over thou&s;ands and millions of the human race; to-morrow, they bow to thine all-devouring &s;word!&mdash;Haughty conqueror! Why could not thy fury be appea&s;ed by the nume|rous victims which are con&s;tantly &s;acrificed at thy &s;hrine? Why did&s;t thou enforce thy claim upon the beloved Father of his country? Why &s;pread the mantle of mourning over a nation, over millions, at a &s;ingle blow?&mdash;Never again &s;hall &s;uch an op|portunity be offered, &s;uch an object be pre&s;ented to thy dart: And he &s;hall ri&s;e and live, when thou art forever de&s;troyed by the almighty power of the Prince of Peace.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Men of &s;uperior excellence ought, while liv|ing, to be re&s;pected, and, when dead, remember|ed with gratitude.</P>
<P>Good rulers are a di&s;tingui&s;hed ble&s;&s;ing. They are the gift of God to any people. The Giver is not to be forgotten becau&s;e of the greatne&s;s of the gift.&mdash;Talents and virtue, in an high degree, are the great requi&s;ites for tho&s;e who fill exalted &s;tations. Talents, to be u&s;eful and efficient, mu&s;t be adapt|ed to the peculiar genius, &s;ituation and circum|&s;tances of a country. Tho&s;e which, in their di&s;|play, would entitle to an high &s;eat in the temple of

fame, under &s;ome circum&s;tances, and in &s;ome &s;ta|ges of &s;ociety, would little conduce, in others, to the &s;plendor of high renown. Opportunities for the exhibition of &s;uch as claim high and unrivalled pre-eminence do not often occur. Revolutions in politics and government u&s;ually open the wide&s;t field, and pre&s;ent the broade&s;t theatre for the exer|tion and application of all that is rare, great and magnanimous. In trying and dark periods in the &s;tate of nations, the world hath been a&s;toni&s;hed, at times, with the view of a re&s;plendent &s;un, bur&s;ting from the clouds of ob&s;curity and beaming with ra|dient brightne&s;s in the political horizon. His &s;plendors, while they dazzled the eye, have dif|fu&s;ed light over the face of community and &s;pread joy to thou&s;ands of trembling hearts.&mdash;In &s;ea&s;ons when tempe&s;ts &s;hake the pillars of ancient e&s;tabli&s;h|ments, and the di&s;organization incident to material changes at home clouds the a&s;pect, talents more original in their nature, and different in their kind, are required, than in &s;cenes of public tranquillity, when the &s;ky is unclouded and the &s;un &s;hines with lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>The mariner who, without difficulty or di&s;honor, could &s;teer the &s;hip, when the &s;urface of the ocean was &s;mooth, the breeze of wind gentle and the noon-day &s;un lighting the heavens and the earth, would be driven from the helm, when the face of the great deep was violently convul&s;ed, the ele|ments, in fierce contention, howled, and the hor|rors of midnight enveloped the waves and the firm|ament in impenetrable gloom.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved that a univer&s;al genius, or a man endowed with abilities to conduct, with wi&s;|dom, energy and &s;ucce&s;s, civil and military ar|rangements, is a rare phenomenon. To be crown|ed with laurels won by valor and &s;kill in the field of battle, and to &s;hine, like the light of heaven, a|mong the celebrated and di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;enators of a
<PB N="16" REF="037353_0014_100CBE8359C95568">
nation is rarely the lot of any mortal.&mdash;Virtue is the guide for the profitable and u&s;eful improvement of great and &s;plendid talents. Mi&s;applied they re&s;em|ble the &s;weeping deluge, the de&s;tructive tornado or ungovernable flames. They &s;pread deva&s;tation in an hour, which years cannot repair.&mdash;How impor|tant is it, that great men &s;hould al&s;o be good men!</P>
<P>When a MOSES, a JOSHUA, a DAVID, a SOLO|MON are exalted to be rulers and legi&s;lators, they &s;hould be honored as cho&s;en of the Lord.&mdash;Real merit, without envy or detraction, &s;hould receive, from a grateful people, and ample reward. A <HI>wor|thy</HI> patriot is a glorious title; add to this <HI>di&s;intere&s;ted,</HI> and you ri&s;e higher in the &s;cale of worth and ad|miration. When God removes from earthly &s;cenes tho&s;e who have filled high &s;tations with dignity, u&s;e|fulne&s;s and applau&s;e, &s;uch di&s;pen&s;ations ought not to pa&s;s unnoticed. They are deeply intere&s;ting to the future welfare of a country. Shall &s;ingular worth, &s;hall the unremitted efforts of the mo&s;t &s;hin|ing talents for public good, &s;hall the mo&s;t noble achievments, the mo&s;t heroic enterprizes be forgot|ten, the moment the mortal remains of the po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ors and actors are depo&s;ited in the &s;ilent vault? Such prai&s;e-worthy deeds ought to be recorded on the hearts of their countrymen, more la&s;tingly than on tables of bra&s;s, and the ble&s;&s;ings enjoyed &s;hould ever remind us of the toils, the dangers, and the virtues of tho&s;e, by whom they were obtained.</P>
<P>The children of I&s;rael te&s;tified their &s;olemn and affectionate remembrance of MOSES by mourning, at his death, thirty days.</P>
<P>Let us improve the &s;ubject by the following re|flections.</P>
<P N="1">1st. God hath de&s;igned this land for many im|portant purpo&s;es of his glory and the good of man|kind.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="037353_0015_100CBE858BED7398">Earthly affairs are controlled by divine wi&s;dom, power and goodne&s;s. Great were the preparations made, in the &s;tate of the nations, for the glorious appearance of the Me&s;&s;iah in the fle&s;h; and the mighty revolutions of the pre&s;ent aera are doubtle&s;s de&s;igned as preparatory &s;teps to the happy, milen|nial &s;tate of the Chri&s;tian church. The whole hi&s;|tory of events &s;ince the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of this em|pire, the great things which God hath done for us as a nation, and in &s;pecial his kind providence in ble&s;&s;ing us with "the Hero of the age," are &s;tand|ing te&s;timonies and evident pre&s;ages that au&s;picious and exten&s;ive de&s;igns are yet in the womb of time. <Q>The kingdom is the Lord's, and He is governor among the nations.</Q> Our natural and political &s;ituation opens high and animating pro&s;pects. Our internal re&s;ources are immen&s;e, and our &s;trength increa&s;ing with &s;uch rapidity, that every external pre&s;&s;ure may &s;oon be &s;et at defiance.</P>
<P>The &s;y&s;tem of the federal government is new in the annals of the world, combining, beyond any example in ancient or modern times, liberty, order and energy. The freedom of religious enquiry, belief and wor&s;hip, fully enjoyed, removes the cau|&s;es of heavy grievances among &s;ome nations, and weakens the temptations to infidelity in others. Science diffu&s;es her benign influence among all cla&s;|&s;es of citizens. The enterprizing &s;pirit of Amer|ica explores every region and corner of the earth for the acqui&s;ition of wealth, and the bravery of her martial &s;ons affords the &s;tronge&s;t hope, that when re&s;i&s;tance to foreign foes is nece&s;&s;ary, by the ble&s;&s;ing of heaven, it will not be without &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>This land &s;eems de&s;tined by heaven to be an a&s;y|lum for the per&s;ecuted and oppre&s;&s;ed among the na|tions of Europe. From the corruption, tyranny and butcheries which de&s;troy the greate&s;t portion
<PB N="18" REF="037353_0016_100CBE87B6C48DB8">
of human felicity on the ea&s;tern continent, may they fly to the&s;e ho&s;pitable &s;hores and &s;hare in the ine&s;ti|mable ble&s;&s;ings of liberty. The foundation &s;eems evidently laid for va&s;t improvement <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n politics, &s;ci|ence and morals; for an happy, flouri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hing and pow|erful empire; an empire, re&s;pected for its govern|ment, its laws, its purity of religion, its commerce and its numbers; a theatre on which the glories of the Redeemer's kingdom will, in the latter day, be illu&s;triou&s;ly di&s;played.</P>
<P N="2">2d. We learn the mutability of &s;ublunary things. Statues of bra&s;s are corroded by the gnawing tooth of time; the mo&s;t durable monuments of art crumble to the du&s;t; crowns fall from the head. Cities loo&s;e their magnificence; empires are bu|ried in the gulph of oblivion; and all earthly glory fades. Can it then be &s;urprizing that the mo&s;t be|loved, the mo&s;t renowned mortal, &s;hould, to day, &s;hine in the highe&s;t &s;plendors of the earth, and to|morrow lie low at the feet of death? That this may be the ca&s;e our a&s;&s;embling in the divine courts this day is a &s;olemn proof.</P>
<P>The Almighty di&s;po&s;er of human events hath commi&s;&s;ioned death to triumph over WASHINGTON, the father and the &s;aviour of his country! A com|plete delineation of the character, the virtues, the exploits of this highly di&s;tingui&s;hed man, I &s;hall not attempt. Even eulogy blu&s;hes when employed on &s;o &s;ublime a theme and confe&s;&s;es that to do per|fect ju&s;tice is beyond her power. His life and his deeds are the highe&s;t encomiums which can po&s;&s;ibly be be&s;towed, and the fame of the&s;e will blazon, till time and earth &s;hall be no more. Future Xeno|phons &s;hall record his ever-memorable heroi&s;m; future Homers de&s;cribe his glowing ardor amid&s;t embattled ho&s;ts&mdash;future Millions invoke the mu&s;e's aid to tune his prai&s;e, and future Robert&s;ons de|tail the battles he fought, the victories he won, the heroes he conquered. Greece &s;tands aba&s;hed, and
<PB N="19" REF="037353_0017_100CBE893B85C330">
Rome hangs her head; and in future ages, when the poet, the hi&s;torian, and the orator have cele|brated the &s;ages, the conquerers, the patriots of an|tiquity, and lavi&s;hed upon them a profu&s;ion of prai&s;e, the trumpet &s;hall &s;ound &s;till louder the name of WASHINGTON and conclude the li&s;t.</P>
<P>The de&s;cription given above will &s;hew the feeble and de&s;titute &s;ituation of the colonies when WASH|INGTON was appointed commander in chief of their forces. It was &s;oon found that the public confi|dence was not mi&s;placed.</P>
<P>During the revolutionary war he di&s;played &s;uch talents as &s;aved his country and a&s;toni&s;hed the world. With great means, great effects may be produced; but to produce great effects, with &s;mall means, re|quires much higher wi&s;dom. Here the American Hero &s;hone, like the &s;un in the firmament. In re|treating where a &s;tand would have been ruin to the cau&s;e, even when greatly cen&s;ured; in concealing the real &s;tate of his force from his enemies and from his own army; and in various ways, annoying, di&s;tre&s;&s;ing and e&s;caping the foe, he exhibited con|&s;ummate prudence and fore&s;ight. Had it not been for the peculiar di&s;a&s;ters and embarra&s;&s;ments with which he was nece&s;&s;itated to contend, one half of the excellencies of his character, the un&s;haken forti|tude of his mind, and the wonderful extent of his mental re&s;ources, would not have been known. Trenton and Princeton will &s;tand, to the end of time, monuments of his readine&s;s to &s;eize a favora|ble oppurtunity to attack, of his &s;oundne&s;s of judg|ment and military addre&s;s.&mdash;His fame &s;oon &s;pread beyond the Atlantic and one of the fir&s;t potentates in Europe did not di&s;dain to place a gallant army under his command.&mdash;The independence of his country being e&s;tabli&s;hed, like Cincinnatus, he re|&s;igned his eminent &s;tation, and, accompanied by the plaudits and fervent prayers of millions, retired to the cultivation of his e&s;tate. Had CAESAR, or
<PB N="20" REF="037353_0018_100CBE8AC212E240">
had CROMWELL commanded the army, a military de&s;poti&s;m would have been e&s;tabli&s;hed; but WASH|INGTON's magnanimity was equal to his &s;ucce&s;s!</P>
<P>By the unanimous &s;uffrages of his fellow-citizens was he repeatedly called to the pre&s;idency of the United States. At length he retired from public life, fondly hoping to &s;pend the evening of his days in that retreat for which he had long and ardently &s;ighed. A gathering cloud involves the nation in darkne&s;s and threatens the demolition of the noble fabric cemented by the blood of thou&s;ands; his country again calls; the eye of age brightens into youth, the &s;word is drawn; when, lo, the &s;um|mons of death arrives!&mdash;He loved his country, he adored the &s;upreme Ruler, a&s;cribing to Him the glory of all &s;ucce&s;s; he beheld the great objects for which he embarked upon the tempe&s;tuous ocean of public life obtained, and, magnanimous and &s;erene in death, hath bid the earth adieu.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON, the pride of America, the glory of the age, now &s;leeps in the land of &s;ilence and of death. The brighte&s;t &s;un in our national horizon is gone down to ri&s;e no more. While to the high mandate of heaven's &s;overeign, with humble &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion, Americans bow, well may they weep! The Hero, the patriot, the &s;age; their friend, their benefactor is laid in the du&s;t. Does a family gath|er around the bed of a fond, a dying parent, and pour out a flood of tears, when the &s;olemn hour of parting arrives; and &s;hall not the children of Co|lumbia weep, when the father of his country lies low? Yes. Let the tear of &s;en&s;ibility gli&s;ten in ev|ery eye. Another &s;uch occa&s;ion will never call. Ye war-worn &s;oldiers, know that your beloved commander is con&s;igned to the tomb. Ye aged &s;ires, know that he, under whom your &s;ons have fought, and bled, and died, is now no more! Ye vir|gins, te&s;tify your grief that your friend, your father, your guardian has fled. Let the whole ma&s;s of peo|ple
<PB N="21" REF="037353_0019_100CBE8EFA95C998">
feel and realize, that the great defender of their rights, him&s;elf "a &s;enate" and "an ho&s;t," hath fini&s;hed his earthly career.</P>
<L>"From Vernon's &s;acred hill dark &s;orrows flow,</L>
<L>Spread o'er the land, and &s;hroud the world in woe.</L>

<L>In &s;ad re&s;pon&s;es &s;ounds from &s;hore to &s;hore,</L>
<L>"Our Friend, our Guide, our Father is no more."</L>
<P>But let not the hearts of Americans de&s;pond. A noble and maje&s;tic pillar in the national fabric is broken, but the corner &s;tone is not removed. He who rendered our deplored chief &s;o rich a ble&s;&s;ing, lives forever; and tho' he hath now &s;pread dark|ne&s;s about our paths, can ea&s;ily di&s;pel the cloud and cau&s;e the &s;un to &s;hine.&mdash;Characters, wi&s;ely &s;e|lected and worthy of public honors, adorn our &s;en|ates, dignify our tribunals of ju&s;tice, and fill the executive departments of government.</P>
<P>Trained under the au&s;pices of the be&s;t of in&s;truc|tors, military leaders are ready to draw the &s;word, and, under the &s;anction of the Almighty, lead the &s;ons of liberty to fame, to glory and tri|umph.</P>
<P>American youth! Let the hallowed flame con|tinue to burn in your bo&s;oms. On you devolves the arduous, but the glorious ta&s;k to &s;ave your country from anarchy, from infamy, from &s;ubju|gation. By the blood which hath fertilized the plains, by the bones which have whitened in the &s;un, by the memory of the valiant heroes who have fallen; by the numberle&s;s bleeding hearts, the bit|ter offspring of the revolution; by the hopes and pro&s;|pects of po&s;terity&mdash;by the a&s;hes of WASHINGTON, be adjured to prove your&s;elves worthy of an inher|itance, re&s;cued from the fangs of tyranny at a price &s;o dear!</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="037353_0020_100CBE9083CA7580">Let the meritorious &s;ervices of our departed He|ro and his patriotic brethren in the field, whether they nobly fell or &s;urvived the furious &s;torm, &s;ecure to them their ju&s;t reward, a "deathle&s;s fame." Let his "&s;potle&s;s example" be followed, his wi&s;e moral and political maxims inculcated and remem|bered, his virtues, many and eminent, public and private, be admired, be imitated; his invaluable <HI>legacy</HI> be engraven upon every heart. Let us prai&s;e the Lord that he hath lived in an high degree of u&s;efulne&s;s, enjoyed the love and the admiration of his countrymen to the concluding &s;cene, far be|yond HANNIBAL, COLUMBUS, and a long train of the mo&s;t worthy patriots; and come at la&s;t to the grave in a good old age, with untarni&s;hed glory and un&s;ullied honor.</P>
<P>As the conclu&s;ion of the whole; remember that death will &s;ooner or later cut down every individu|al.&mdash;Earthly honors are fading, worldly glory tran|&s;itory. Tho&s;e of heaven are immortal; that of the upper world perpetual. The approbation of our judge will be infinitely more important than the wailing and lamentation of millions. This alone is our pa&s;&s;port to the kingdom of glory. Let me then point you to an example compared with which that of WASHINGTON is ob&s;cured with clouds, and to the death of a &s;uperlatively dignified per&s;onage, which cau&s;ed nature to agonize with groans, that of the glorious and exalted Redeemer.
