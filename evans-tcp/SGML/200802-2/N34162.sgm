<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS,&amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>MANKIND in every age, and at every period of the world, have been unani|mous in their &s;entiments concerning Liberty, which they have univer&s;ally e&s;teemed as one of the mo&s;t &s;acred and invaluable ble&s;&s;ings,&mdash;as a right naturally belonging to all,&mdash;and of which no human authority could po&s;&s;ibly di|ve&s;t them. The human mind &s;eems to have implanted in it by nature, a certain de&s;ire after Freedom, which rendering the &s;malle&s;t degree of confinement or re&s;traint, irk&s;ome and into|lerable, appears to have been given for the very purpo&s;e of &s;ecuring us in that &s;tate of Liberty and Independence, wherein we were all born, and to which we have all indi&s;cri|minately a claim. But cu&s;tom, who&s;e laws are arbitrary and tyrannical, has gained to great
<PB N="6" REF="044751_0005_101F01C8ADD96958">
an a&s;cendency over our rea&s;on, that we are not &s;urprized when we behold the mo&s;t civilized and enlightened nations, deviating from tho&s;e &s;imple and invariable rules of nature which mu&s;t be perceptible even to the mo&s;t ignorant and unlearned people. Blinded by it, the mo&s;t virtuous and re&s;pectable people, have rendered them&s;elves contemptible, and degenerated into viciou&s;ne&s;s; and under its influence, we may at pre&s;ent behold the virtuous citizens of America, giving their &s;anction to a practice, which, in the criminality and inju&s;tice of its nature, has not been exceeded by the people of the mo&s;t barbarous ages.</P>
<P>THE Slavery of the unfortunate Africans, is the practice to which I advert. It is a prac|tice of the mo&s;t &s;hameful and inhuman nature, and demands the attention of every citizen who would wi&s;h to be e&s;teemed either virtuous or hone&s;t; for hone&s;tly does not always con&s;i&s;t in a &s;trict adherence to the laws, which are frequently defective in their nature, and in many in&s;tances give &s;anction to the mo&s;t frau|dulent dealings. In order to avoid error, and the commi&s;&s;ion of inju&s;tice, we need only to con&s;ult our own bo&s;oms; where the virtuous and hone&s;t man will meet with an approbation
<PB N="7" REF="044751_0006_101F01CB74D5F870">
of his conduct; and the vicious and di&s;hone&s;t man, although patronized and protected by the laws, will meet with reprehen&s;ion, for his di&s;hone&s;ty and ba&s;ene&s;s. It is to this tribunal, and not to that of the laws, that I wi&s;h to &s;ubmit the propriety of the practice at pre&s;ent in debate. For although by the laws of our country we may be licen&s;ed in the en&s;laving of the Negroes, and in treating them in what manner we plea&s;e, neverthele&s;s, as tho&s;e laws are of our own creation, and may con&s;equently be replete with error and inju&s;tice, it becomes tho&s;e who are the authors thereof, to in&s;pect into the nature of them, and to abrogate whatever part of them may be improper, or incon&s;i&s;tent with tho&s;e &s;uperior laws of nature; on which all laws, if either rightful or ju&s;t, mu&s;t indubitably be founded.</P>
<P>THAT all men have naturally a right to Liberty, and that to deprive them of it, is the mo&s;t arbitrary and unauthorized exten&s;ion of power (even if there were no other laws in exi&s;tence which re&s;pected it, and if our own rea&s;on did not very evidently point it out to us) mu&s;t mo&s;t manife&s;tly appear from the repeated declarations of our Congre&s;s, and the Con&s;ti|tutions of the different States; all of which, in
<PB N="8" REF="044751_0007_101F01CE12B39900">
the mo&s;t po&s;itive manner a&s;&s;ert, that all men are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of certain natural, inherent rights, of which they cannot be dive&s;ted, but by the mo&s;t arbitrary and unju&s;tifiable mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>IT is an invariable and an undoubted max|im, that wherever there is a right exi&s;ting on the one part, there mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be an ob|ligation on the other; that is, if the Negroes are rightfully entitled to their liberty, there is a con&s;equent obligation on us, not to injure or mole&s;t them in the peaceable enjoyment of it, &s;ince it would be the height of ab&s;urdity to &s;uppo&s;e that they could po&s;&s;e&s;s a ju&s;t and un|alienable title to their freedom&punc; and that we could at the &s;ame time be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an equal right of depriving them of it.</P>
<P>THE only que&s;tion therefore which can ari&s;e on a mature con&s;ideration of the &s;ubject, is in my opinion this, Are the Negroes men? For if they be men, and if all men have a right to liberty, as is univer&s;ally acknowledged, and as you al&s;o mo&s;t particularly a&s;&s;ert, they mu&s;t indubitably, as men, be entitled to a partici|pation of that right; and you, con&s;equently, nor no other nation in the world, can right|fully deprive them of it.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="044751_0008_101F01CF9D37EB60">UNDER what pretext then do we retain them; or rather, with what ju&s;tice did we at fir&s;t reduce them from a &s;tate of liberty, to that of the mo&s;t abject &s;ervitude? For &s;ince we cannot po&s;&s;ibly di&s;cover in the laws of nature, which are the ba&s;is of all rightful laws, any rightful power which we can have, to exerci&s;e the &s;malle&s;t degree of authority over the Africans, more than over any other nation in the world, tho&s;e per&s;ons who can per&s;uade them&s;elves that the en&s;laving them is not one of the mo&s;t unwar|rantable and inhuman practices that ever cha|racterized the people of any country, or time, mu&s;t either be entirely deve&s;ted of every &s;enti|ment of humanity,&mdash;or mu&s;t be &s;o extremely ignorant as to &s;uppo&s;e that the Creator of the univer&s;e made a di&s;crimination between the White People and the Negroes, with re&s;pect to their privileges, and that he gave the pre|eminence to the White People; to whom it became the Negroes, either on account of their unbecoming colour, or as M. Monte&s;cue very ironically ob&s;erves, of their &s;hort and curly hair, to be obedient and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive;&mdash;a &s;up|po&s;ition which however ridiculous it may be, is neverthele&s;s not more &s;o than many others which are u&s;ed by the proprietors of Negroes, in vindication of their conduct.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="044751_0009_101F01D23B696578">THE introduction of the Negroes into this country, was one of the greate&s;t proofs which the Briti&s;h crown could give, of their tyranny and ba&s;ene&s;s. In order to increa&s;e the popu|lation of the country, they did not think it &s;ufficient to &s;end over a number of criminals, who being detrimental to &s;ociety were unwor|thy of living longer in their own country, but al&s;o by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Guinea trade, &s;ent over thou&s;ands of mi&s;erable wretches, over whom we were privileged to exerci&s;e the mo&s;t unlimited authority, for the purpo&s;e of pro|moting the wealth and richne&s;s of the then colonies, and the con&s;equent advantages to the mother country. This traffic obtained imme|diately the countenance of the laws, by means of the Briti&s;h governors on the continent, who &s;tudious only of the intere&s;t of the crown, were ready to adopt any mea&s;ures which might have a tendency to increa&s;e it. But however fla|grant the inju&s;tice, or however glaring the in&s;olence of the mea&s;ure, I am &s;orry to ob&s;erve that they have pa&s;&s;ed away entirely unnoticed; and that altho' free, we &s;till pur&s;ue a practice which would have rendered us contemptible, even as the &s;ubjects of a different power. Many of our citizens are irrational enough
<PB N="11" REF="044751_0010_101F01D51302FD38">
or at lea&s;t are &s;o blinded by their intere&s;t, as to imagine t hat the purcha&s;e of the Negroes from the Briti&s;h, or tho&s;e acting under their authority, was &s;ufficient of it&s;elf to afford a rightful and compleat title, not only to them but al&s;o to their po&s;terity forever. But tho&s;e per&s;ons might, with as much propriety, con|tend that the purcha&s;e of any article from a thief, who had wrongfully gotten it into his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, would have an effect to deprive the original po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of his right, and to ve&s;t it in the purcha&s;er; which would be entirely to overthrow that ju&s;t, tho' &s;imple maxim, which informs us that no man can give that which is not his own; and would open a field to the commi&s;&s;ion of every &s;pecies of di&s;hone&s;ty and fraud.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t unavoidably in&s;pire with horror, a mind po&s;&s;e&s;t of the mo&s;t trifling portion of &s;en&s;ibility, to reflect on the many and enor|mous cruelties which have been practi&s;ed to|wards tho&s;e ignorant and inoffen&s;ive people, by the con&s;ent of our government, and under the &s;anction of our laws. The wars which have been carried on among them for a &s;eries of years, have taken their ri&s;e, in a great mea|&s;ure, from the lucrative di&s;po&s;itions of tho&s;e
<PB N="12" REF="044751_0011_101F01D9C82CA6C0">
nations which may have promi&s;ed to them&s;elves a con&s;iderable profit from the &s;ale of tho&s;e whom they might have captured from another nation, le&s;s numerous and le&s;s powerful than them&s;elves.</P>
<P>THE barbarous and uncivilized people make war, and the civilized and enlightened people &s;hare with the victorious in the cruel and de|plorable con&s;equences of it. It is true that we have not been &s;pectators, but we may very ea&s;ily form a judgment of the horrors and di&s;tre&s;s which have been the nece&s;&s;ary and inevitable con&s;equences of those &s;avage wars. Our ears have not been &s;aluted by the groans of wounded and of dying wretches, nor have our eyes beheld the outrages and deva&s;tations which have been committed by the conquerors, on the country of the vanqui&s;hed. We hear not the &s;ighs of parents for their unfortunate children, nor the cries of children for their ab&s;ent parents; of who&s;e protection and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, death or an exten&s;ive ocean, mu&s;t forever deprive them. We hear not the reiterated lamentations of the hu&s;band for his wife, or of the wife for her hu&s;band; but we behold tho&s;e very per&s;ons when they arrive in our country, where, with all the&s;e agonizing and
<PB N="13" REF="044751_0012_101F01DCA1DDA5B0">
torturing reflections,&mdash;after having been drag|ged away from their friends, relations, and every thing that could be dear to them,&mdash;after having been ca&s;t into a nau&s;eous dungeon, and brought through tempe&s;tuous &s;eas, in&s;tead of meeting with a little con&s;olation, or receiving &s;omething which might in &s;ome degree, com|pen&s;ate for their liberty, they are compelled to labour continually in the fields, and to under|go all the additional mi&s;eries and di&s;tre&s;s of which the human mind is &s;u&s;ceptible; and to &s;uffer the mo&s;t excruciating tortures the body can po&s;&s;ibly endure, or the unrelenting hand of cruelty can inflict. But not content with the barbarity and inju&s;tice which we exerci&s;e upon the fathers, we have extended our inhu|manity &s;till farther, towards their guiltle&s;s and unoffending offsprings. From whom do we derive an authority over <HI>them</HI>? Is the unborn infant, involved al&s;o in the fate of its unhappy parent? Is it becau&s;e di&s;tant from its country and its friends, cut off from every right and every privilege of Men? Or do we rather con|&s;titute our&s;elves beings of a &s;uperior order, and determine to vi&s;it upon it, and its po&s;terity forever, the calamities of its father?</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="044751_0013_101F01DE2887BF68">IF we cannot ju&s;tify our&s;elves in the com|mi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch acts as the&s;e, upon princi|ples of right: If in the place of law or ju&s;tice, we &s;ub&s;titute violence and &s;uperior force, then are we again returned to that &s;tate of anarchy and di&s;order, wherein one man may &s;eize upon another's property, injure his per&s;on, or even take away his life, without the dread of pu|ni&s;hment, or the apprehen&s;ion of being com|pelled to make the &s;malle&s;t degree of re&s;titu|tion for the injury which he may have done. If force be our law, then do we &s;ubject our|&s;elves to the government of the Negroes, whenever by their numbers they may be ren|dered capable of exerci&s;ing it. The law by which we hold them, being in their favour, we cannot reckon it unju&s;t that they &s;hould wre&s;t the rod of de&s;poti&s;m from our hand, and inflict it with as little humanity on us as we have been accu&s;tomed to inflict it upon them.</P>
<P>IF we would but con&s;ider for a moment, the origin of the conte&s;t between Great-Britain and our&s;elves, and would but conde&s;cend to compare their &s;ituation with re&s;pect to us, to our then &s;ituation with re&s;pect to what was at that time called the Mother Country, we &s;hall be able to di&s;cover the inju&s;tice of our conduct
<PB N="15" REF="044751_0014_101F01E222632190">
towards the Africans, in a plainer and more con&s;picuous light. What, in the fir&s;t place, was the cau&s;e which induced us into that war?&mdash;a war, which although ju&s;tifiable, was as cruel and unnatural as, that between a parent and a child. Was it not the apprehen&s;ion which we entertained, of a di&s;po&s;ition in the Mother Country to incroach upon our natural Liberties, and to dive&s;t us of tho&s;e privileges to which all mankind are entitled, and which we con&s;idered as our birth-right? We were not in a &s;ituation &s;imilar to that of the Ne|groes, nor could we apprehend that the Briti&s;h crown ever had it in contemplation to reduce us to &s;uch an one; yet notwith&s;tanding, po&s;|&s;e&s;t of a ju&s;t and lively &s;en&s;e of our rights, we contemned the idea of being &s;ubject to the in&s;olence and caprice of a Parliament; and were led on to break every tye of relation&s;hip, of friend&s;hip and affection, rather than to &s;uf|fer tamely, what we con&s;idered as an unwar|rantable exerci&s;e of power. But how much more deplorable than ours could have been, mu&s;t be the &s;ituation of the Negroes in our country. They do not enjoy any of tho&s;e privileges which we e&s;teemed &s;o e&s;&s;ential to our exi&s;tence, as to hazard our lives in order
<PB N="16" REF="044751_0015_101F01E3A8A23CA8">
to obtain them. In point of liberty, they are by no means to be con&s;idered as &s;uperior to the Brutes in our fields, and are inferior to tho&s;e who range the fore&s;ts, and partake of nature's gifts. The world has at all times afforded us examples of licentiou&s;ne&s;s and vice; but if we can reflect on all the&s;e, cir|cum&s;tances which re&s;pect our fellow creatures, without commi&s;erating their fate, or making a &s;ingle effort, in order to relieve them of it, we may a&s;&s;ure our&s;elves that the hi&s;tory of our time will equal that of our mo&s;t barbar|ous predece&s;&s;ors, in the number of examples which it will furni&s;h both of licentiou&s;ne&s;s and depravity.</P>
<P>THE United States of America, have, by one of the mo&s;t vigorous exertions that ever adorned the page of ancient or of modern hi&s;|tory, e&s;tabli&s;hed to them&s;elves that Liberty and Independence which they &s;o ardently de|&s;ired; and to which, as men, they conceived they had a claim.&mdash;Their Legi&s;lators are the guardians of that Liberty; but how incon&s;i&s;t|ently with the &s;acred nature of their tru&s;t, and the dignity of their &s;tation, do they conduct them&s;elves! Whil&s;t with one hand they are vigorou&s;ly &s;upporting the &s;tandard of Liberty,
<PB N="17" REF="044751_0016_101F01E655C94540">
they are exerci&s;ing with the other, the rod of Slavery and De&s;poti&s;m;&mdash;whil&s;t engaged in pre&s;erving their con&s;titutions from violation or infraction, they violate one of its mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential articles, and &s;ubvert the very ba&s;is on which it is con&s;tructed. By their con&s;titutions it is declared, that Liberty is inherently the property of all; and neverthele&s;s, in open vio|lation of that principle, (to which one would &s;uppo&s;e they are not only bound by every tye of ju&s;tice, but al&s;o of honor, to comply) they deprive more than two-thirds of their inhabi|tants of their freedom, without being able to a&s;&s;ign a &s;ingle rea&s;on for which they do it, or offering a &s;ingle argument in vindication of the mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>IF we properly con&s;ider the principles by which the human mind is mo&s;t generally ac|tuated, we &s;hall be induced al&s;o to believe the inju&s;tice of this practice is not more flagrant, than its con&s;equences may in time be detri|mental. The mo&s;t ignorant and unenligh|tened nations may, like tho&s;e who have already become civilized and enlightened, emerge from their &s;tate of ignorance and incogitancy, and be po&s;&s;e&s;t of the &s;ame &s;entiments of their dig|nity and right, with tho&s;e who exi&s;t in a &s;tate
<PB N="18" REF="044751_0017_101F01E7DAA4F028">
of liberty and refinement;&mdash;and &s;hould the Negroes, while living in &s;ubjection to us, ac|quire tho&s;e &s;entiments, and be dive&s;ted of tho&s;e &s;ervile notions by which they are at pre|sent influenced, what &s;hould we not have to apprehend from their indignation and re&s;ent|ment. When created by a &s;en&s;e of injuries &s;u&s;tained, how dreadful, and how greatly to be apprehended, are the in&s;urrections of the injured;&mdash;imbecility, or a want of numbers, can alone be &s;ufficient to prevent them from gratifying their revenge, by retaliating fully on their oppre&s;&s;ors. It would be prudent then to con&s;ider well the&s;e con&s;equences, before the time come when we may probably experience them. If we have no regard to the ju&s;tice, let us at lea&s;t pay &s;ome attention to the policy of our practices, which in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance would, I am convinced, be &s;ufficient to induce us to dive&s;t our&s;elves of our property in Ne|groes, as &s;peedily as po&s;&s;ible; for the profits which are derived from them, are in my opi|nion, too trifling to render it our intere&s;st to retain them.</P>
<P>PROPORTIONABLE to the number of &s;laves, mu&s;t be the quantity of one's land; and by how much the greater may be the number of

them, by &s;o much the greater mu&s;t be the quantity of provi&s;ion, and the additional ex|pences which attend a family; &s;o that, as the profit is increa&s;ed on the one hand, it is coun|terbalanced by the expences which inevitably attend it on the other. The number of the Negroes in the &s;outhern States, and particu|larly in that of Virgina, daily continues to in|crea&s;e; while that of the White People, by rea&s;on of the emigrations to other parts of the country, continues as rapidly to decrea&s;e.&mdash;The poor man, who&s;e land is already almo&s;t worn out by cultivation, induced to di&s;po&s;e of it to his more wealthy neighbour, (who&s;e ne|ce&s;&s;ities for territory annually increa&s;ing, is obliged to purcha&s;e that which may be mo&s;t convenient to him) appropriates the money which he obtains by the &s;ale of his land, to the purcha&s;e of other in a more fertile country, where he may obtain a &s;ufficiency for him&s;elf, upon more moderate terms. This has occa|&s;ioned the very great emigrations which have been made, for &s;everal years pa&s;t, from the adjacent States, to the &s;ettlement of Kentucke; where the fertility of the country, and the &s;mallne&s;s of their taxable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, render their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence more ea&s;y, and con&s;equently their life more agreeable to them.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="044751_0019_101F01F0DD8576F0">THE Negroes will always in time of war, prove injurious to the country wherein they live; for being naturally inimical to tho&s;e who are their oppre&s;&s;ors, they will avail them|&s;elves of every opportunity which may offer, of liberating them&s;elves from their oppre&s;&s;ion: And as an enemy will never fail to &s;eize every occa&s;ion of the kind, we may with &s;afety con|clude, that the Country or State which po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es a con&s;iderable number of &s;laves, is inca|pable of defending it&s;elf again&s;t inva&s;ions from abroad; and whenever attacked, will unavoid|ably become an ea&s;y conque&s;t to its invaders.</P>
<P>CONSIDERING every circum&s;tance therefore which relates both to policy and right, we are bound by the duty which we owe to humanity and our&s;elves, to adopt the mo&s;t immediate and effectual mode of aboli&s;hing a practice, in its nature &s;o tyrannical, and &s;o unworthy of mankind.&mdash;Let Liberty, of whom we have &s;o rapturou&s;ly &s;poken, and in who&s;e cau&s;e we have &s;o ob&s;tinately fought, pre&s;ide univer&s;ally over our country, and be the directre&s;s of our &s;teps.&mdash;Let that patriotic &s;pirit, of which we &s;o greatly boa&s;t, di&s;play it&s;elf in our conduct in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance; and then, and not till then, &s;hall we be a virtuous and an hone&s;t

<P>WHEN nations or individuals, act incon&s;i&s;t|ently with tho&s;e principles by which they have profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves to be led and actuated, they render them&s;elves contemptible in the eyes of all who are &s;pectators of their conduct; and de&s;troy all the confidence and faith which might have been previou&s;ly repo&s;ed in them.</P>
<P>AFTER the effu&s;ion of &s;o much blood in the defence of our rights, (which we did not con&s;ider as peculiarly belonging to our&s;elves, but as the unalienable property of all mankind) let us evince to the world that our &s;entiments are equally noble with our declarations; that we are in reality guided by that love of Liberty which induced us into the field of battle, and that hatred of u&s;urpation with which our minds have apparently been fraught.</P>

<P>THE &s;ubject is plain, and I &s;hould conceive that it would be to doubt both your under|&s;tanding and humanity, to expatiate longer on it, or to offer more arguments, in order to prove what in its nature is &s;elf-evident and &s;imple. What I have laid down for your pe|ru&s;al, has been dictated by the highe&s;t zeal for your pro&s;perity and welfare.&mdash;It has been dic|tated by tho&s;e principles of humanity which I &s;hall always e&s;teem it as the greate&s;t Hap|pine&s;s to po&s;&s;e&s;s; and although it &s;hould be of no effect, and &s;hould pa&s;s away entirely di&s;|regarded, I &s;hall con&s;ole my&s;elf with this a|greeable reflection,&mdash;"That my motives were commendable and good." On the contrary, &s;hould it contribute in the lea&s;t to call up your
