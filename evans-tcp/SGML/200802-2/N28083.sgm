<P>THIS anniver&s;ary, we u&s;ed to celebrate with joy, as the Birth Day of one of the greate&s;t and be&s;t men; but our joy is turned into &s;orrow:&mdash;in&s;tead of the emblems of joy and fe&s;tivity, we are &s;hrouded with the in&s;ignia of &s;orrow and heart-felt <HI>grief:</HI>&mdash;for this great and good man is no more!&mdash;His death, which took place on the 14th of la&s;t December, has inervated and paralized all the &s;prings of hilarity, which were &s;et in motion at the remembrance of his birth-day, which (allowing for the alteration of &s;tile) took place on the 22d of February, 1732.</P>
<P>BUT why! why &s;hould his death eclip&s;e all the joy of his natal day? for does not the wi&s;e king &s;ay, that a good name is better than precious ointment, and the day of ones death is better than the day of ones birth?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ecc. vii. 1.</NOTE>&mdash;And who &s;ays the contrary? Certainly, the fragrancy of a good name, ju&s;tly acquired, is more exten&s;ively diffu&s;ed, more beneficial in its influence, and more permanent in its duration:&mdash;It will live in the page of hi&s;tory, and continue to &s;hed its be|nign influence to unborn generations, when the mo&s;t pre|cious ointment &s;hall lo&s;e all its perfume, and its &s;ubtle ef|fluviae will evaporate into empty air.</P>

<P>AT his birth he &s;ets out upon a very precarious journey, with no certain objects in view, is attended on the way with &s;in and &s;orrow: "for man who is born of a woman is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f few days and full of trouble."

him with all that wi&s;dom and courage which enabled him to fore&s;ee, face and conquer, or to e&s;cape from tho&s;e diffi|culties and dangers he could not overcome. He adorned and inriched him with all tho&s;e illu&s;trious virtues which made him out&s;hine all his co-patriots both in the field and in the cabinet&mdash;at the head of a brave army, or as the fir&s;t magi&s;trate in the chair of &s;tate. For it is thine O God to give both riches and honor, and in thine hand is power and might, and it is in thine hand to make great and to give &s;trength unto all." Let therefore the tear of ingenuous &s;orrow which has bedewed the cheek of millions, be mixed with the tear of gratitude to God for &s;uch a &s;ea&s;onable, &s;uch an accompli&s;hed in&s;trument of his glory and our &s;alvation.</P>
<P>HE was but the in&s;trument, and his wi&s;e and energetic admini&s;trations was the channel, through which flowed to us, the greate&s;t and the choice&s;t national ble&s;&s;ings "from the Father of Lights, from whom cometh down every good and perfect gift." Gratitude to the Father of the univer&s;e has a ju&s;t claim upon us, for this tribute of re&s;pect which we this day pay to the memory of the "man whom he de|lighteth to honor."</P>
<P>IT is a debt due to departed merit, which can in no way be paid &s;o well, as by the &s;pontaneous effu&s;ions of &s;in|cere &s;orrow;&mdash;by &s;trictly adhering to his wi&s;e coun&s;els, and by immitating his amiable and illu&s;trious virtues.</P>
<P>IT is a rate thing to &s;ee true greatne&s;s and real goodne&s;s blended in one character:&mdash;We have heard of great men, an <HI>Alexander,</HI> a <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> a <HI>Pompey,</HI> a <HI>Lewis</HI> and a <HI>Frederic:</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="037433_0005_100D4215391E8348" MS="y">
and from the bu&s;tle and noi&s;e which they made, and the deva&s;tations and &s;laughter which they &s;pread, they, with oth|ers of &s;imilar characters were called <HI>great</HI> but without an abu&s;e of language they could not be called <HI>good:</HI>&mdash;For whether they meditated <HI>peace</HI> or <HI>war</HI>&mdash; the tranquility or di&s;turbance of the world&mdash;whether they &s;ought the pro&s;perity or de|va&s;tation of countries; whether they govern nations&punc; or command armies, &s;till intere&s;t, ambition or revenge, were their leading-motives; and while they ruled or tyranized over millions they had no rule over their own pa&s;&s;ions, and they &s;et no bounds to their ambition and avarice.</P>
<P>BUT rare as it is for great men to be good, we have one in&s;tance at lea&s;t and we hope we have many, but the great abilities of the good man who&s;e death we this day lament, was combined and adorned with eminent virtues.</P>
<P>WE &s;aw him early ri&s;e to eminence by the joint di&s;play, of both great abilities and illu&s;trious virtues. We &s;aw him ri&s;e and &s;hine the <HI>Patriot,</HI> the <HI>Hero</HI> and the <HI>Saint.</HI> At the head of a victorious army, at the helm of government, and in the humble retreats of rural life.</P>
<P>THOUGH &s;urrounded with all the fa&s;cinating alurements of ambition, intere&s;t, &s;en&s;uality and licentiou&s;ne&s;s, cov|ered with glory, inve&s;ted with power, and abound|ing in wealth; yet foregoing all &s;elfi&s;h and mercenary views, he maintained that ab&s;olute &s;elf-government as gave him a ju&s;t claim to the character of the pious, benevolent, ju&s;t, meek, temperate, and <HI>good man.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="037433_0006_100D421733507D68">WE have &s;een him, unappalled in the mid&s;t of great dangers and embarra&s;&s;ments; extricating him&s;elf and his faithful bands or con&s;tituents, "without having recour&s;e to mean compliances, or di&s;honorable expedients."</P>
<P>THIS favorite &s;on of fortune was unaffected with her ca|pricious <HI>favors</HI> or <HI>frowns</HI>:&mdash;He was undi&s;mayed at the mo&s;t formidable a&s;pects, uncontaminated amid&s;t the &s;tronge&s;t temptations&mdash;"No bribe could &s;educe him, no terror could overawe him." He acknowleded God in all his way, and looked to him to direct his &s;teps for him; and ever approv|ed him&s;elf to God, and to his own con&s;cience as in the &s;ight of God;&mdash;In compari&s;on with <HI>this,</HI> it was with him "a &s;mall thing to be judged by men's judgments." But it was his great concern to be found faithful to that Being, who had intru&s;ted him with &s;o many talents, "that he might give up his account with joy." And agreeable to that religion which he publicly profe&s;&s;ed, he was benevolent to all men kind and faithful to his friends, generous to his enemies compa&s;&s;ionate to the poor and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed.</P>

malice or envy employed to blot his character, or to the uncandid cen&s;ures which little minds pa&s;&s;ed upon a partial view of his public conduct; but he was all &s;en&s;i|bility, activity and zeal in whatever concerned the public welfare.</P>
<P>HE, (as one ob&s;erves) both in his public and private walks, "&s;upported dignity without pride, humility with|out meanne&s;s, ju&s;tice without partiality or &s;everity, liberal|ity without profu&s;ion, courage without ra&s;hne&s;s or pre&s;ump|tion; and with a nice &s;en&s;e of propriety he always did eve|ry thing in the be&s;t manner and time." Such a character is a <HI>phenomenon</HI> in our degenerate world; but &s;uch a <HI>phe|nomenon</HI> Almighty God, has cau&s;ed to appear in our <HI>Hemi&s;|phere,</HI> and by its benign influence has ble&s;&s;ed, honored and di&s;tingui&s;hed us as a nation above all modern nations be|&s;ides.</P>
<P>I CAN &s;ay as a learned writer on this occa&s;ion &s;aid.&mdash; <Q>I never met in any volume of ancient or modern hi&s;tory, or even in the fictions of <HI>romance</HI> a &s;ingle character &s;o ex|empt from every &s;pot of vice, from every &s;hade of weak|ne&s;s or indi&s;cretion, or &s;o complete in the abilities of the general, in the talents of the &s;tate&s;man&mdash;&s;o uniform and replete in the virtues of the citizen and the chri&s;tian.</Q></P>

to prevent the evil con&s;equence of undue foreign in|fluence or dome&s;tic faction and maintain the peace and in|dependence of America.&mdash;And what gave a dignified lu&s;tre to all his talents and virtues was, that he united piety and morality in his whole deportment; for whatever were his talents, or whatever were his virtues, he con&s;ecrated them all to his God and his country.

<HEAD>THE <HI>Addre&s;s,</HI> OF THE LATE <HI>General George Washington,</HI> TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>FRIENDS AND FELLOW-CITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE period for a new election of a Citizen to admini|&s;ter the executive government of the United States, being not far di&s;tant, and the time actually arrived when your thoughts mu&s;t be employed in de&s;ignating the per&s;on, who is to be clothed with that important tru&s;t, it appears to me proper, e&s;pecially as it may conduce to a more di&s;tinct expre&s;&s;ion of the public voice, that I &s;hould now appri&s;e you of the re&s;olution I have formed, to decline being con|&s;idered among the number of tho&s;e out of whom a choice is to be made.</P>
<P>I BEG you, at the &s;ame time, to do me the ju&s;tice to be a&s;&s;ured, that this re&s;olution has not been taken, without a &s;trict regard to all the con&s;iderations appertaining to the re|lation which binds a dutiful citizen to his country; and that, in withdrawing the tender of &s;ervice which &s;ilence in my &s;ituation might imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, I am influenced by no dimi|nution of zeal for your future intere&s;t; no deficiency of grateful re&s;pect for your pa&s;t kindne&s;s: But am &s;upported by a full conviction that the &s;tep is compatible with both.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="037433_0019_100D4231A100E5F8" MS="y">THE acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in the office to which your &s;uffrages have twice called me, have been a uniform &s;acrifice of inclination to the opinion of duty, and to a defference for what appeared to be your de|&s;ire. I con&s;tantly hoped that it would have been much earlier in my power, con&s;i&s;tently with motives which I was not at liberty to di&s;regard, to return to that retirement from which I had been reluctantly drawn. The &s;trength of my inclination to do this, previous to the la&s;t election, had even led to the preparation of an addre&s;s to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then perplexed and critical po&s;ture of affairs with foreign nations, and the una|nimous advice of per&s;ons entitled to my confidence, impel|led me to abandon the idea.</P>
<P>I REJOICE, that the &s;tate of your concerns external as well as internal, no longer renders the pur&s;uit of inclination incompatible with the &s;entiment of duty o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> propriety: And am per&s;uaded whatever partiality may be retained for my &s;ervices, that in the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of our country, you will not di&s;approve my determination to retire.</P>
<P>THE impre&s;&s;ions with which I fir&s;t undertook the ardu|ous tru&s;t, were explained on the proper occa&s;ion. In the di&s;charge of this tru&s;t, I will only &s;ay, that I have with good intentions, contributed towards the organization and ad|mini&s;tration of the government, the be&s;t exertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. Not uncon&s;cious, in the out&s;et, of the inferiority of my qualifications, experi|ence in my own eyes, perhaps &s;till more in the eyes of others, has &s;trengthened the motives to diffidence of my&s;elf; and

every day the increa&s;ing weight of years admoni&s;hes m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> more and more, that the &s;hade of retirement is as nece&s;&s;ary to me, as it will be welcome. Satisfied, that if any circum|&s;tances have given peculiar value to my &s;ervices, they were temporary, I have the con&s;olation to believe, that while choice and prudence invite me to quit the political &s;cene, patrioti&s;m does not forbid it.</P>
<P>IN looking forward to the moment, which is intended to terminate the career of my public life, my feelings do not permit me to &s;u&s;pend the deep acknowledgment o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that debt of gratitude, which I owe to my beloved coun|try for the many honors it has conferred upon me; &s;til<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> more for the &s;tedfa&s;t confidence with which it has &s;up|ported me; and for the opportunities I have thence enjoy|ed of manife&s;ting my inviolable attachment by &s;ervice&punc; faithful and per&s;evering, though in u&s;efulne&s;s unequal to my zeal. If benefits have re&s;ulted to our country from the&s;e &s;ervices, let it always be remembered to our prai&s;e and as an in&s;tructive example in our annals, that under cir+cum&s;tances in which the pa&s;&s;ions, agitated in every direc|tion, were liable to mi&s;lead, amid&s;t appearances &s;ometime dubious, vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune, often di&s;couraging in &s;it|uations, in which not unfrequently want of &s;ucce&s;s has coun|tenanced the &s;pirit of critici&s;m&mdash;the con&s;tancy of you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;upport was the e&s;&s;ential prop of the efforts, and a guaran+tee of the plans by which they were effected.

<P>HERE perhaps, I ought to &s;top.

The&s;e will be offered to you with the more freedom, as you can only feel in them the di&s;intere&s;ted warnings of a parting friend, who can po&s;&s;ibly have no per&s;onal motive to bias his coun&s;el.

<P>THE unity of Government which con&s;titutes you one people, is al&s;o now dear to you. It is ju&s;tly &s;o; for it is a

main pillar in the edifice of your real Independence, the &s;upport of your tranquility at home, your peace abroad; of your &s;afety; of your pro&s;perity; of that very liberty which you &s;o highly prize. But, as it is ea&s;y to fore&s;ee, that from different cau&s;es and from different quarters, much pains will be taken, many artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth, as this is the point in your political fortre&s;s, again&s;t which the batteries of internal and external enemies will be mo&s;t con&s;tantly and actively (though often covertly and in&s;idiou&s;ly) direct|ed, it is of infinite moment that you &s;hould properly e&s;ti|mate the immen&s;e value of your National Union, to your collective and individual happine&s;s; that you &s;hould cheri&s;h a cordial, habitual and immoveable attachment to it; ac|cu&s;toming your&s;elves to think and &s;peak of it as of the pal|ladium of your political &s;afety and pro&s;perity, watching for its pre&s;ervation with jealous anxiety; di&s;countenancing whatever may &s;ugge&s;t even a &s;u&s;picion that it can in any event be abandoned; and indignantly frowning upon the fir&s;t dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the re&s;t, or to enfeeble the &s;acred ties which now link together the various parts.</P>
<P>FOR this you have every inducement of &s;ympathy and intere&s;t. Citizens, by birth or choice, of a common coun|try, that country has a right to concentrate your affections. The name of American, which belongs to you in your na|tional capacity, mu&s;t always exalt the ju&s;t pride of patriot|i&s;m, more than any appellation derived from local di&s;crim|inations. With &s;light &s;hades of difference you have the &s;ame religion, manners, habits and political principles.

You have in a common cau&s;e fought and triumphed toge|ther; the Independence and Liberty you po&s;&s;e&s;s are the work of joint councils, and joint efforts, of common dan|gers, &s;ufferings and &s;ucce&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>BUT the&s;e con&s;iderations however powerfully they ad|dre&s;s them&s;elves to your &s;en&s;ibility, are greatly outweighed by tho&s;e which apply more immediately to your intere&s;t. Here every portion of our country finds the mo&s;t com|manding motives for carefully guarding and pre&s;erving the union of the whole.</P>
<P>THE North in an unre&s;trained intercour&s;e with the South, protected by the equal laws of a common govern|ment, finds in the production of the latter, great additional re&s;ources of maritime and commercial enterpri&s;e, and pre|cious materials of manufacturing indu&s;try. The South in the &s;ame intercour&s;e, benefitting by the agency of the North, &s;ees its agriculture grow, and its commerce expand. Turning partly into its own channels the &s;eamen of the North, it finds its particular navigation invigorated&mdash;and while it contributes, in different ways, to nouri&s;h and in|crea&s;e the general ma&s;s of the national navigation, it looks forward to the protection of a maritime &s;trength, to which it&s;elf is unequally adapted. The Ea&s;t in a like intercour&s;e with the We&s;t, already finds, and in the progre&s;&s;ive im|provement of interior communications, by land and water, will more and more find a valuable vent for the commo|dities which it brings from abroad, or manufactures at home. The We&s;t derives from the Ea&s;t &s;upplies requi&s;ite to its growth and comfort&mdash;and what is perhaps of &s;till

greater con&s;equence, it mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity owe the &s;ecure enjoyment of indi&s;pen&s;able outlets for its own productions to the weight, influence, and the future maritime &s;trength of the Atlantic &s;ide of the union, directed by an indi&s;&s;oluble community of intere&s;t as <HI>one nation.</HI> Any other tenure by which the We&s;t can hold this e&s;&s;ential advantage whether derived from its own &s;eparate &s;trength, or from an apo&s;tate and unnatural connection with any foreign power, mu&s;t be intrin&s;ically precarious.</P>
<P>WHILE then every part of our country thus feels an im|mediate and particular intere&s;t in union, all the parts combi|ned cannot fail to find in the united ma&s;s of means and ef|forts, greater &s;trength, greater re&s;ource, proportionably greater &s;ecurity, from external danger, a le&s;s frequent in|terruption of their peace by foreign nations; and what is of ine&s;timable value! they mu&s;t derive from union an exemp|tion from tho&s;e broils and wars between them&s;elves, which &s;o frequently afflict neighbouring countries, not tied toge|ther by the &s;ame government; which their own rival&s;hips alone would be &s;ufficient to produce, but which oppo&s;ite foreign alliances, attachments and intrigues would &s;timulate and imbitter.&mdash;Hence likewi&s;e they will avoid the nece&s;&s;ity of tho&s;e overgrown military e&s;tabli&s;hments, which under any form of government are inau&s;picious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as particularly ho&s;tile to Republi|can Liberty: In this &s;en&s;e it is, that your union ought to be con&s;idered as a main prop of your liberty, and that the love of the one ought to endear to you the pre&s;ervation of the other.</P>
<P>THESE con&s;iderations &s;peak a per&s;ua&s;ive language to every reflecting and virtuous mind, and exhibit the conti|nuance

<P>In offering to you, my countrymen, the&s;e coun&s;els of an old affectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the &s;trong and la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion I could wi&s;h&mdash;that they will controul the u&s;ual current of the pa&s;&s;ions, or prevent our nation from running the cour&s;e which has hitherto marked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he de&s;tiny of nations: But if I may even flatter my&s;elf, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hat they may be productive of &s;ome partial benefits, &s;ome <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cca&s;ional good; that they may now and then recur to moderate the fury of party &s;pirit, to warn again&s;t the mi&s;|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hiefs of foreign intrigue, to guard again&s;t the impo&s;tures <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f pretended patrioti&s;m; this hope will be a full recom|en&s;e for the &s;olicitude for your welfare, by which they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ave been dictated.</P>
<P>How far in the di&s;charge of my official duties, I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">een guided by the principles which have been delineated, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e public records and other evidences of my conduct mu&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itne&s;s to you and to the world.

of my own con&s;cience is, that I have at lea&s;t believed my|&s;elf to be guided by them.</P>
<P>IN relation to the &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting war in Europe, my Proclamation of the 22d April, 1795, is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your approving voice, and by that of your repre&s;entatives in both Hou&s;es of Congre&s;s, the &s;pirit of that mea&s;ure has continually governed me, unin|fluenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.</P>
<P>AFTER deliberate examination, with the aid of the be&s;t lights I could obtain, I was well &s;atisfied that our country, under all the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, had a right to take and was bound in duty and intere&s;t to take a neutral po|&s;ition. Having taken it, I determined, as far as &s;hould depend on me, to maintain it with moderation.</P>
<P>THE con&s;iderations which re&s;pect the right to hold this conduct, it is not nece&s;&s;ary on this occa&s;ion to detail. I will only ob&s;erve, that according to my under&s;tanding o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the matter, that right, &s;o far from being denied by any o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Belligerent Powers, has been virtually admitted by all.</P>
<P>THE duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred without any thing more, from the obligation which ju&s;tice and humanity impo&s;e on every nation, in ca&s;es in which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is free to act, to maintain inviolate the relations of peace and amity towards other nations.</P>
<P>THE inducements of intere&s;t for ob&s;erving that conduct will be&s;t be referred to your own reflections and experience With me, a predominant motive has been to endeavour to gain time to our country to &s;ettle and mature its yet recen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in&s;titutions, and to progre&s;s without interruption, to tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> degree of &s;trength and con&s;i&s;tency, which is nece&s;&s;ary t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> give it, humanly &s;peaking, the command of its own fortunes</P>
<P>THOUGH in reviewing the incidents of my admini&s;tra+tion,
<PB N="40" REF="037433_0039_100D425A52C73C58" MS="y">
I am uncon&s;cious of intentional error: I am neverthe|le&s;s too &s;en&s;ible of my defects not to think it probable that I have committed many errors. Whatever they may be, I fervently be&s;eech the Almighty to avert or mitigate the evils to which they may tend. I &s;hall al&s;o carry with me the hope that my country will never cea&s;e to view them with indulgence; and that after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its &s;ervice, with an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be con&s;igned to oblivion, as my|&s;elf mu&s;t &s;oon be to the man&s;ions of re&s;t.</P>
<P>RELYING on its kindne&s;s in this as in other things, and actuated by that fervent love towards it, which is &s;o natural to a man who views in it the native &s;oil of him&s;elf and his progenitors for &s;everal generations; I anticipate with plea|&s;ing expectation that retreat, in which I promi&s;e my&s;elf to realize, without alloy, the &s;weet enjoyment of partaking in the mid&s;t of my fellow-citizens, the benign influence of good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">aws under a free government&mdash;the ever favorite object of my heart, and the happy reward as I tru&s;t, of our mutual cares, labors and dangers.</P>
