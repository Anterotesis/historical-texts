It is also proper in all putrid and nervous fevers, especially in the throat distemper.&mdash;Dose, a teaspoonful to be taken in a little wine, or water, and repeated once in two, three or four hours as occasion may require. In intermittent fever, or fever and ague (as it is called) should the disorder not give way by administering a Purge No. 2, and the use of the Bark for a week or fortnight, administer a Puke No. 1 when the patient first perceives the cold is coming on&mdash;afterwards use the Bark once in 2 or 3 hours. If this does not break it up at the coming on of the ague &s;it, give 25 or 30 drops of Laudanum, and continue the Bark as before; which treatment will seldom fail of effecting a cure. In putrid fevers add to a dose of the Bark 10 or 16 drops of Elixir Vitriol No. 10, which will contribute very much to its efficacy. N. B.&mdash;In dangerous cases where the Bark is used it may be given as often and in as large doses as the stomach will bear. It should be given at the going off of fevers of all kinds.</P>

</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="16" TYPE="medicine">
<HEAD>No. 16.&mdash;TINCTURE SACRA.</HEAD>
<P>This medicine has long been in great repute, not only as a cathartic, but as a warm stomachic medicine in cold, phlegmatic habits, especially where there is a cold sensation, with pain at the stomach. It should be given in the dose of half a table spoonful, 3 or 4 times in the course of 24 hours, and oftener if need be, when it will seldom fail to relieve the above described complaint, by gently stimulating the stomach, and open|ing the bowels. Dose, as a purge, from 2 to 4 table spoonfuls. It is a proper purge to be given in all cases where warm and stimulating purges are wanted. It has a good effect on those who have long been in the ha|bit of using ardent spirit.</P>

</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="18" TYPE="medicine">
<HEAD>No. 18.&mdash;BALSAM TRAUMATICUM.</HEAD>
<P>In case of a flesh wound from a cut or other means (if not so large as to want some stitches to bring the lips of the wound together) first lay a little Lint upon it, then drop enough of this Balsam upon the Lint to wet it, then spread a pledgit of tow or web Lint with Basillicon, and put it snug over it. Let it remain 4 or 5 days before removing the dressings. This Balsam is remarkable for easing the pain and accelerating the heal|ing of fresh wounds.

<P>This should be applied to all wounds where there is fungus flesh, or proud flesh (as it is called) in high edged foul ulcers, and in venerial ul|cers, when they are ob&s;tinate and do not heal, and in all old sores where there appears to be dead sloughy flesh. In any of the above cases sprin|kle enough of the Precipitate to thinly cover the surface of the wound; then lay a little Lint over it, and over that put a pledgit spread with Basilli|con. Continue this dressing once a day till the sores put on a healthy ap|pearance. In case of bad chancres, or bad venerial ulcers, mix with Ba|sillicon Salve, enough of this Precipitate, to give it quite a red appear|ance, and dress them twice a day, applying it immediately to the sores; continue the dressing in this way till the ulcers put on a healthy appear|ance, then dress with simple Basillicon.</P>

<DIV2 N="22" TYPE="medicine">

</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="37" TYPE="medicine">

In bad pains in the right side, upon the region of the liver, apply a Blis|tering Plaister, and also in violent head-ache apply a Blister to the fore|head or back of the neck, and dress as above directed. In violent inflam|mation of the eyes, a Blister applied to the temples or behind the ears will give relief.</P>

<DIV2 N="38" TYPE="medicine">
<HEAD>No. 38.&mdash;DIACHYLON PLAISTER.</HEAD>
<P>This is a proper application for sore shins or other slight wounds, to be spread upon a rag and applied immediately to the wound.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="39" TYPE="medicine">
<HEAD>No. 39.&mdash;SUGAR OF LEAD.</HEAD>
<P>In inflammation from bruises, or other causes, dissolve 1 of these Powders or 2 tea spoonfuls in a pint of rain water, bathe the part affected frequent|ly, and keep a linen rag wet with it, applied constantly. It will tend greatly to reduce the inflammation and ease the pain. In the venerial disease, where there is an inflammation and swelling of the prepuce or foreskin (so called) or where there is inflammation, swelling and much pain of the testicles, keep a linen rag wet, applied constantly. Should not the inflammation, swelling and pain abate in a day or two, take of the above solution, and the soft part of white bread, if to be had, if not, com|mon ship bread, pounded fine, boil the bread till it is perfectly soft, form|ing a poultice, spread it upon any convenient cloth, and apply it to the part. Repeat the poultice once in 3 or 4 hours if the case be urgent.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="40" TYPE="medicine">
<HEAD>No. 40.&mdash;CALOMEL.</HEAD>
<P>This is a very useful and efficacious medicine, but requires caution and judgment in its administration; it is a preparation of Mercury, and strict attention to the Directions should be attended to, or mischief may be produced by it. In violent attacks of pleurisy or lung fevers, after bleeding (if necessary) and blistering, one or two grains of this medi|cine may be given once in six or eight hours, until the inflammatory symptoms abate which are known by the abatement of the pain and diffi|cult breathing: but if at any time a sore mouth, or too much looseness be produced, omit the use of it. Inflammation of the liver, which is known by a bad pain in the right side, generally accompanied with some swelling directly under the ribs, and to which people are very subject who are in the East-India trade, should be treated in the first stage very simi|lar to pleurisy, using the Calomel as above directed. Look at general
<PB REF="037604_0008_100EE8BBA8CE51D0">
Directions under disease of the Liver. In the yellow fever this me|dicine may be given to the extent of three or four grains once in three or four hours, and continued until the violence of the disease abates, unless it produces too much purging, or sore mouth, in either case omit its use. This medicine may be given as a substitute for Mercurial Pills in bad cases of pox, in doses of two or three grains once or twice a day; on the mouth becoming sore omit the use of it for a few days; then use as be|fore if the disease has not abated.</P>
<P>A sore mouth produced by the use of this or any other mercurial medi|cine is soon removed by taking enough of the Flour of Sulphur, night and morning, to keep the bowels a little open, and washing the mouth often with flaxseed tea.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="41" TYPE="medicine">
<HEAD>No. 41.&mdash;FLAX-SEED.</HEAD>
<P>Take a sufficient quantity to make a tea quite musilaginous, put it into a proper vessel, boil it for 3 quarters of an hour, when cool it will be fit for use. This tea may be taken freely in lung and pleurisy fevers; it is a good substitute for Gum Arabic, and it may be used freely in the dysentery. This Tea may be drank freely in the clap, and when there is much scald|ing add a teaspoonful of Nitre to a tumbler full twice or three times a day. The Sweet Spirits of Nitre will have nearly the same effect as the Salt.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="42" TYPE="medicine">
<HEAD>No. 42.&mdash;GUM ARABIC.</HEAD>
<P>A very useful emollient. In claps dissolve 2 table spoonfuls in a pint of hot water; let the person drink freely of it constantly, and should there be much scalding and smarting of the urine, add a teaspoonful of Nitre to a tumbler of this tea, 3 or 4 times a day. In all cases of smart|ing or suppression of urine this is a very useful medicine, and should be taken freely. In dysentery this tea may be taken freely. It is also good nourishment.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="43" TYPE="medicine">
<HEAD>No. 43.&mdash;CLAP PILLS.</HEAD>
<P>In a recent clap, let one of these Pills be taken every night at going to bed&mdash;they will generally operate twice or three times the next morning. Should they not operate sufficiently, once in two or three days take a dose of Salts; they may be continued in this manner until the scalding is nearly abated. During the use of these Pills, drink freely of Gum Arabic or Flaxseed Tea, and avoid the use of spirituous liquors.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="44" TYPE="medicine">
<HEAD>No. 44.&mdash;INJECTION POWDERS.</HEAD>
<P>After the inflammatory symptoms have abated, which is known by the pain and scalding of the urine having abated, and there continues a run|ning, dissolve one of these powders in half a pint of water, and throw it up two or three times a day, which by abstaining from the use of spiritu|ous liquors, and avoiding violent exercise, will generally effect a cure in a short time.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="45" TYPE="medicine">
<HEAD>No. 45.&mdash;BALSAM COPAIVA.</HEAD>
<P>In old obstinate gleets, where other things have failed of effecting a cure, take 30 drops of this medicine night and morning; it may be con|tinued for some time. For inward strains and bruises it was formerly in considerable repute, and may be taken night and morning as above di|rected.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="46" TYPE="medicine">
<HEAD>No. 46.&mdash;MERCURIAL PILLS.</HEAD>
<P>These Pills are proper to be given in all cases where mercury ought to be slowly introduced into the system. In the pox one of these Pins may

be given night and morning, and continued until the teeth and gums be|gin to be sore, and the person begins to spit, unless the person get well before, in that case their use would be unnecessary. Whenever the pa|tient's mouth begins to be sore and spitting comes on, omit the use of them until it abate, then use as before if need be. These Pills are pro|per to be given in the liver complaint after bleeding and blistering, (see general Directions under disease of the Liver.) While in the use of these Pills be careful not to take cold.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="47" TYPE="medicine">
<HEAD>No. 47.&mdash;MERCURIAL OINTMENT.</HEAD>
<P>In case of buboes in the groin from venerial infection, rub in a piece of this ointment as large as a small walnut twice a day upon the part, and on the inside of the thigh as low down as the knee, continue the use of it until the swelling is reduced. Should the swelling be obstinate and not give way by using the ointment for some time, take a Mercurial Pill every night at going to bed, but if the mouth become sore omit the use of them for a short time, then use as before if need be. This oint|ment may be applied to all hard indolent tumours.

<P>This Salve I have found a very useful and efficacious application for chancres. Spread it upon a little Lint and apply it immediately to the ulcer, dress it twice a day, continue the use of it until they appear white and healthy; then if it is too drawing, dress with Healing Salve. In obstinate bad chancres where this Salve is not powerful enough, and does not produce considerable discharge from the ulcers, take a small piece of Basillicon Salve, mix thoroughly with it Red Precipitate enough to make it quite red, and dress with it until they appear white and healthy, then dress with the above or Healing Salve, as may be necessary. It will always be necessary to take either the Mercurial Pills or Mercury Drops where there are chancres, as the disease is in the system, and there will always be danger of their returning if medicine is not taken to remove it from the system.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="description of medical treatment">
<P>BEING convinced from my own observation that sailors suffer more from the venerial disease, than all others, I have been induced to pay par|ticular attention, in writing these directions to provide the most proper and efficacious remedies for it in its various stages. I shall now attempt to give a plain and concise description of the disease in its various stages, and point out with as much precision as possible the different species, and the forms under which it appears. Much has been said by the most able writers on this disease to prove that gonorrhoea or clap, and syphilis or pox, are specifically distinct, and different diseases. Others have main|tained with ability, and have clearly proved by experiments and facts, that the morbid poison which produces a gonorrhoea virulenta, or clap, may be productive of syphilis or pox. The latter opinion I am fully per|suaded is correct from my own observation, for I have frequently seen ca|ses of clap where from inattention to cleanliness in the patient, the matter which was discharged from the urethra has been allowed to lodge about the glands penis, and has produced very obstinate and troublesome chan|cres. I have also seen cases where chancres were the first complaint that appeared, and where I believe the patient had not been connected with any other person, and the gonorrhoea afterwards came on, I am therefore clearly of an opinion that a simple gonorrhoea or clap is not so very sim|ple a disease as is maintained by Mr. Bell, and some other writers on the subject, and his mode of treating it will I know from my own observation, often fail of effecting a radical cure.</P>
<P>The preceding remedies I have been in the constant use of for sever|al years past, and with universal success, some of which are of my own invention. In writing a plain, concise, and short description of the dis|ease, I shall allude to the numbers adapted to the cure of particular symp|toms, and by careful attention any person on board a vessel may be cured as effectually as if under the care of a physician. Yet the patient has
<PB REF="037604_0011_100EE8C1004B60E0">
much to do. It is very necessary to avoid as much as possible the use of violent exercise, salt and high seasoned provisions, and strictly to abstain from the use of ardent spirit, and the free use of wine. Avoid exposure to wet and cold as much as possible. With these precautions and strict at|tention to the directions, in recent cases, the patient may in a short time be effectually cured. Gonorrhoea virulenta or clap generally makes its appearance from two to five days after contracted. The first symptoms are a slight itching, which is followed by a slight twinging pain, and soon some scalding of the urine at the entrance of the penis. The running ge|nerally follows in a few days, and the above symptoms increase, and chor|dee frequently follows in a few days if nothing is done to mitigate the complaint.</P>
<P>After a person has been connected with a suspicious woman and these symptoms follow, take a Pill No. 43, every night, make free use of Gum Arabic or Flaxseed Tea for constant drink, take two teaspoonfuls of Sugar of Lead No. 39, dissolve it in a pint of rain water, wash the end of the pe|nis five or six times a day; continue this course for four or five days, or un|til the inflammatory symptoms have abated. Then take a Powder No. 44, dissolve as there directed, fill a Syringe, carefully introduce it into the end of the penis, throw it up, contract the end of the penis so as to keep it up for the space of one minute, repeat three times in this way for once using. Use three times a day and continue until the running abates entire|ly. If in the course of the disease there should be a troublesome chordee, and a painful soreness extending up the urethra, throw up a little Sweet Oil three or four times a day, and rub a little Mercurial Ointment exter|nally upon the urethra twice a day, which will generally soon remove the complaint.</P>
<P>Under the above mode of treatment a simple clap will generally be cured in two or three weeks, yet they sometimes are very obstinate and do not readily yield, and an obstinate gleet remains. In these cases I have found the Mercury Drops No. 51 to succeed better than any medi|cine I have been in the use of, see directions for taking. The Balsam Co|paiva is a medicine in some repute for the cure of old gleets, and when they remain obstinate, and other things fail, it ought to tried, see No. 45 for directions in taking.</P>
<P>It frequently happens in a clap that there is much inflammation and scalding, and sometimes a painful phymosis which is when the preputium or foreskin is so inflamed and swollen that it will not pass back over the glands penis, and paraphymosis, which is where the preputium or foreskin gets back of the glands penis and becomes so inflamed and swoln that it cannot pass forward. In these cases where the inflammatory symptoms run high, it will be necessary to bleed, and in addition to taking the Pills, a dose of Salts may be taken every other day, dissolve a teaspoonful of Nitre in a tumbler of Flaxseed or Gum Arabic tea, let it be taken 2 or 3 times a day, this will relieve the violence of the scalding. In case of phy|mosis or paraphymosis, take half a pint of rain water and half a pint of sharp vinegar, dissolve 2 teaspoonfuls of Sugar of Lead in it, keep a linen rag wet applied constantly. If that does not remove the swelling and in flammation in 2 or 3 days, take of the same solution, and pound ship bread perfectly fine, make a poultice and apply that; repeat as often as necessary, until the swelling and inflammation subsides. Should there re|main any hardness or thickness of the prepuce after the inflammation is gone, rub in a little Mercurial Ointment twice or three times a day until it goes off. Swelled testicles is a complaint which is frequently attendant on gonorrhoea virulenta. When it is occasioned by a sudden suppression of the running, warm fomentations applied to the penis, such as immersing the penis in warm milch, wetting flannels in warm milch and water, or Flax|seed tea, kept constantly applied, and injecting sweet oil warm, will gen|erally bring on a return of the running and frequently relieve the inflamma|tion and swelling. Should not this succeed, and there is much inflamma|tion and pain, take a solution of Sugar of Lead, as above mentioned and keep a cloth wet with it cold, constantly applied. If this does not
<PB REF="037604_0012_100EE8C327347408">
succeed, make a poultice as directed in paraphymosis, and keep it con|stantly applied. It will be necessary to keep the bowels gently open by giving Castor Oil or Salts, and afterwards if there is much pain give 40 drops of Laudanum, and repeat it occasionally if the pain be severe. Where there is much inflammation and pain, blood taken from the scro|tum by leeches, or scarifying with a lancet, will give much relief, but had better not be attempted unless by a physician, but take from the arm 12 or 16 ounces of blood. The testicles, during the inflammation and swelling, should always be kept suspended in a pouch, made of flan|nel, if to be had, steaming them over warm vinegar where there is much hardness and pain, will generally give much relief, and may be done ve|ry often. In some cases after the pain and inflammation have subsided, there will remain an obstinate hardness of the testicle. For this com|plaint rub in a small piece of Mercurial Ointment twice or three times a day, and take of the Mercury Drops night and morning.</P>
<P>In all cases of clap strict attention ought to be paid to cleanliness. If the matter which is discharged from the urethra is allowed to lodge about the glands penis, it is very apt to produce troublesome chancres. The pa|tient ought a number of times every day to wash the penis thoroughly in milch and water, or water. This will make the cure much more speedy. Be very cautious not to tie any thing about the penis which will in the least obstruct a free circulation. I have seen several very bad and obsti|nate cases of paraphymosis produced solely by this cause. I have likewise seen severe cases of swelled testicles produced in this way.</P>
<P>It sometimes happens in a clap, that there is occasioned by the inflam|mation of the urethra, such a degree of spasm and stricture, as to pro|duce a total suppression of urine. In this case take a Bougee, oil it with sweet oil, carefully introduce it into the urethra, pass it up until it enters the bladder, let it remain for a short time, which will generally take off the spasm in such a degree that by withdrawing it the urine will flow freely. Repeat the use of it again if necessary. Whenever this stricture should happen, after obtaining a discharge of the urine, throw up sweet oil five or six times a day.</P>
<P>Lues veneria, syphilis, or pox, is that species of disorder which is considered as the most difficult of cure. The system is considered as affected generally with the venerial virus. It makes its appearance in various parts of the body and in various forms; some of the principal are chancres about the glands penis, buboes in the groin, ulcers in the throat, foul obstinate ulcers about the legs and other parts of the body, carious bones, venerial blotches on the skin of a copper colour, venerial nodes or swelling of the periosteum (a substance which covers the bones), veneri|al warts, ulcers in the nose, violent inflammation which sometimes ends in a loss of the eye sight.</P>
<P>When any of the above symptoms appear, it will be necessary to take Mercury enough to produce a sore mouth, unless the complaint gives way before. In case of chancres, while taking the Mercurial Pills, dress with the Salve No. 48. Should they be obstinate and not heal in the course of two or three weeks, dissolve a small piece of Blue Stone in a little water, and touch them with that once a day. If this does not effect a cure, take a little Basillicon Salve, mix with it Red Precipitate enough to make it quite red; dress twice a day with this spread on a piece of rag or Lint, and immediately applied to the sores. All obstinate veneri|al ulcers are to be treated in the same way as chancres.</P>
<P>In case of bubo or hard swelling in the groin while taking the Mercu|rial Pills, rub a small piece of Mercurial Ointment twice or three times a day upon the swelling and the inside of the thigh as low down as the knee. Should not the swelling go off in the course of two or three weeks, but become hard and painful, it will be necessary to poultice it and en|deavor to bring it to a head. After it becomes perfectly soft, and the matter is felt to fluctuate in the tumour, and it is pointed, take the Lan|cet and lay it open so that the matter may be discharged. If there
<PB REF="037604_0013_100EE8C5485FD838">
should remain much hardness after the matter is discharged, lay a little Lint over the orifice, and poultice until it subsides, then dress with Basillicon Salve. Should the sore be foul, and not heal kindly, mix Red Precipitate with the Salve and dress with that.</P>
<P>Venerial warts are sometimes very troublesome. When they make their first appearance, touch them once or twice a day, with the Lunar Caustic, and mix a large proportion of Red Precipitate with Basillison Salve, spread it upon a little Lint or a piece of rag and apply it imme|diately to the wart. Dress once a day. The Blue Stone may also be applied as caustic to venerial warts.</P>
<P>In venerial sore throat the principal dependence is on the exhibition of Mercury internally. After the Mercury has been given some time and the ulcers do not heal; make a strong decoction of White Oak Bark, and let the patient gorgle his throat often with that. Should the ulcers ap|pear high edged and foul, dissolve a small piece of Blue Stone in a little water, make a swab by winding two round the end of a stick, dip it into this solution, and touch the ulcers once or twice a day. If the White Oak Bark is not to be obtained, make a strong decoction of Bark No. 9, and use that for a gorgle.</P>
<P>The principal dependence in the cure of venerial nodes or enlarged bones, is the internal exhibition of Mercury. It should be continued un|til the mouth become sore, and a tenderness of the gum should be kept up for two or three weeks. Where there is much pain and restlessness during the night, give 40 drops of Laudanum. It often happens that af|ter a person has had the venerial disease several times, that there ap|pears a troublesome eruption upon the prepuce and glands penis. For this complaint take one teaspoonful of Sugar of Lead and the same quantity of Calomel, add half a pint of rain water, shake it throughly every time of using it, wash 4 times a day; this is a very effectual reme|dy. This wash used once or twice a day assists much in the cure of chancres.</P>
<P>Ulcers in the nose from venerial infection are to be treated much in the same way as venerial sore throat. If it does not give way by the use of Mercury till the mouth become sore, which should be kept so for two weeks, inject into the nose the solution of Sugar of Lead and Calomel twice a day.</P>
<P>In all the above cases of syphilis or pox, where they have been of long standing and obstinate, I have found the Mercury Drops to be the most effectual remedy; they may be taken much longer without producing a sore mouth than the other preparations of Mercury, and the patient is not so apt to take cold on exposure to wet and cold. It is an extremely useful and efficacious medicine in old bad cases.</P>
<P>In all the above cases, after the use of Mercury, if there is much de|bility, the Bark should be taken 3 or 4 times a day until appetite and strength returns.</P>

If it be an arm or leg, let one person take hold of the limb below the fracture, and gently pull, while another places his hand upon the fracture and places the bones in their right place. If the limb is strait, of equal length, and every other way corresponds with the other, you may generally conclude that the bone is reduced into its right place. Carefully bathe the limb with brandy and vinegar, or brandy; then pass a flannel bandage a number of times round the limb 5 inches above and 5 below the fracture; upon the bandage place four splints, 10 or 12 inches long, covered with tow, at equal distance from each other, securing them with any convenient string; bathe it fre|quently through the bandage with brandy, or Sugar of Lead water, and should it swell so as to make the bandage too tight, loosen it occasionally as may be necessary.</P>
<P>The limb lies easiest when bent to about half a right angle, the patient lying partly on the same side, if it be a leg. If an arm it should be slung up.

<DIV2 TYPE="description of medical treatment">
<HEAD>WOUNDS.</HEAD>
<P>In bad wounds there is often a profuse bleeding, which requires the first and most particular attention. The application of dry Lint, and a bandage, will often succeed; but if an artery of any considerable bigness is injured, and the blood spirts out largely, you must form some tight compression between the wound and the trunk of the body, or heart, which will stop the discharge till you can find the bleeding, and secure it with your needle. If it be an arm or a leg that is wounded or taken off, take a strong handkerchief or large cord, and tie it moderately tight some way above the wound; if the injury is below the knee or elbow, it will be best to fix the cord 2 or three inches above the knee or elbow, and put a round short piece of wood or cane beneath the cord; by turning the cane you tighten the cord till it stops the blood; let some person hold the cane in this position till you wipe the blood from the wound, then let him slack the cord till the blood spirts out, at which time fix your eye upon the vessel, order the cord again tightened, and keep sight of the vessel till you pass your needle, which is crooked, along side of the vessel, about a quarter of an inch deep, and draw the thread half through; then enter the needle near where it came out, and pass it up the other side of the blood vessel, so that the point may come out near where you entered it; then draw the thread through and tie it tight, and you will find it will stop the bleeding of that vessel. If there be others that bleed, se|cure them in the same manner; after which you must take off the cord, and dress the wound with Lint, bandage, &amp;c. After the first dressing, it is best to let the wound go 3 or 4 days before opening it, after which it may be dressed every, or every other day. If the discharge of matter be considerable, apply a little Lint over the wound, and over that a plais|ter of Basillicon; but when there is little or no discharge of matter, ap|ply simply a plaister of Healing Salve.</P>

<HEAD>THE DISORDERS</HEAD>
<P>Which are most incident to people in India, are the bilious or remitting fever, and the liver disease. The first is known by the following symp|toms. It generally comes on suddenly, and begins with a sense of weak|ness
<PB REF="037604_0015_100ED34B6EB93650">
and great lowness of spirits. These symptoms are attended with a greater or less degree of chilliness, a giddiness, nausea, pains in the head and loins, and a trembling of the hand; the countenance has a pale or yellow cast, the skin is commonly dry, the eyes dull and sometimes yellow; and as the disease advances, the sickness of the stomach increases, and often an obstinate vomiting takes place. As soon as the person is seized with the above symptoms, it will be proper to give him a purge of Jalap and Calomel (one of the Powders No. 2) in a little molasses; if the first dose should not operate in 4 hours, give another; and if the second dose should be vomited up without taking effect, dissolve a dose of Salts in a gill of hot water, and add a table spoonful of vinegar to it, and when cold give the patient one quarter part of it every hour, till it produces a free discharge by the bowels. If the patient should be much exhausted by the purge, it will be proper to give him 30 drops of Laudanum. If the fever the next day should remit, give the patient two teaspoonfuls of Bark in wine or porter, every 2 hours; but if the pain in the head should re|main obstinate, and the fever and sickness should be violent, it will be better to repeat the medicine given the first day. Should the patient's skin be dry, and the thirst and fever very violent, it will be proper to give him on the third day the following medicine: dissolve a powder of Tartar Emetic (No. 1) and a dose of Salts in a gill of hot water, and when cold let the patient take 2 table spoonfuls every 2 hours until a free discharge is excited. If the patient should be thirsty, let him drink free|ly of Cream of Tartar beverage. As soon as the stomach and bowels are thoroughly cleansed, the principal part of the cure must depend on the Bark, which must be given as freely as the stomach can bear. During the whole course of the disease a costive habit must be avoided by taking the purges above mentioned, and by drinking the Cream of Tartar beverage. If the bark should prove purgative, from 5 to 10 drops of Laudanum may be added to each dose as occasion may require.</P>

A pain in the right shoulder is also a frequent attendant on this complaint. On the first attack it will be proper that the patient should be bled from half a pint to a pint; then immediately apply a Blister over the seat of the pain, as large as the whole hand; at the same time take a teaspoon|ful of Nitre in a cup of tea, or Barley water, every hour or two; and ev|ery night or morning take a Mercury Pill, unless they should prove too purgative. It will also be proper as soon as the soreness of the blister will permit, to rub in on the side, a piece of Mercurial Ointment the size of a nutmeg, once or twice a day, until a gentle salivation for 10 or 15 days be kept up. If the salivation should incline to be violent, it may be moderated by laying aside the Pills and Ointment for a short time, and give a little Flour of Sulphur night and morning to keep the bowels open. If the Mercury should incline to run off by the bowels, give 15 or 20 drops of Laudanum once or twice a day as may be necessary.
