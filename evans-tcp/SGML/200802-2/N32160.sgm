<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT STATED ON THE MANUMISSION OF SLAVES,</HEAD>
<P>Shewing, that in Lieu of the u&s;ual Security required, certain Sums paid at &s;everal Periods of Manumi&s;&s;ion, will amply &s;ecure the PUBLICK, as well as their Owners from any future Burden.</P>
<P>THE following calculations are formed on a &s;up|po&s;ition, that on an average, people do not become incapable of &s;upporting them&s;elves, until they are 60 years of age&mdash;that of 10 negroes &s;et free at 21 years of age, 6 of them die before they exceed their 60th year&mdash;that the remaining 4 live to the age of 72 years&mdash;that only one fourth part of the&s;e &s;urvivors ever become a publick charge&mdash;and that for the la&s;t 12 years, the &s;um of &pound;.10 per annum will be &s;ufficient for his or her maintenance.</P>
<P>THAT we may be much within bounds, we have allowed that more than <HI>nine</HI> Negroes out of the <HI>&s;eventy</HI> may become chargeable, though among the whites we find that not <HI>one</HI> in <HI>fifty</HI> of tho&s;se who depend on their labour for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, are &s;upported by the publick.</P>

<P>N. B. The calculations are all formed on tables, made from the Bre&s;lau bills of mortality, by the very ingenious and judicious Dr. Edmund Halley, which are in &s;uch repute, as to be univer&s;ally u&s;ed in valuing annuities on lives, and all other purpo&s;es of that nat|ure, to which they are adapted. For in&s;tance, it is found by tho&s;e bills, that of 592 per&s;ons of the age of 21 years, only 242 per&s;ons were living 39 years after|wards, viz. at the age of 60 years. Thus for our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e we &s;ay, if 592 per&s;ons aged 21 years, only leave 242 per&s;on alive at the age of 60 years; how many will 10 per&s;ons of the age of 21 years, leave alive at 60 years of age? The an&s;wer is 4, agreeable to our calculations.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="042395_0006_101B611DB389D900">THIS account is &s;tated with as much accuracy as was po&s;&s;ible, without introducing fractions, which would have multiplied figures to little purpo&s;e. When they did occur in the tables, the neare&s;t whole number was u&s;ed, and as that method is &s;trictly observed, both in the debits and credits, it is pre&s;umed any in|accuracy ari&s;ing from it, mu&s;t be immaterial.</P>
<P>IF 10s. is paid to the over&s;eers of the poor, on the manumi&s;&s;ion, for every year the &s;lave hath exceeded 21, it is found that, although there is allowed for the maintenance of every one becoming chargeable, <HI>four</HI> times as much as the Penn&s;ylvania law requires, there &s;till remains in favour of the publick, a balance of &pound;.150, exclu&s;ive of &pound;.431 15s. which is the amount of the taxes that would be paid by them, before they attained the age of 60 years: after which age, it is allowed, that tho&s;e who come to want a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;hould be <HI>whol|ly</HI> maintained, when probably they might want but <HI>lit|tle</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;tance for &s;ome years afterwards.&mdash;In the cal|culation of the taxes no account is made of the pro|bability of &s;everal of them acquiring &s;uch e&s;tates, or following &s;uch trades, as would be &s;ubject to much higher taxes; but every one of them is reckoned among the very <HI>lowe&s;t</HI> of the taxables.&mdash; In calculating the intere&s;t on the depo&s;it money, it is carried to 66 years ; becau&s;e the expence of a maintenance begin|ning at 60, and ending at 72, brings it on an average to 66. It may be ob&s;erved that the intere&s;t carried to the credit of the account, might with great ju&s;tice be much increa&s;ed: For in&s;tance, 40 years intere&s;t on &pound;.25, only amounts to &pound;.60, (as &s;tated in the account) whereas it is highly rea&s;onable, that when &pound;.25 has doubled it&s;elf, which it will do in 16 years and 2 thirds of a year, at 6 per cent per annum, the intere&s;t on the doubled &s;um, to wit, &pound;.50, should thereafter com|mence as on a principal &s;um, which will again be dou|bled
<PB N="7" REF="042395_0007_101BD8F4DF3EFA48">
in 16 years and 2 thirds of a year, and then amount to &pound;.100, on which intere&s;t again reckoned for 6 years and 2 thirds of a year longer (being in the whole 40 years) is &pound;.40 more or &pound;.140 total; which &s;um may be ju&s;tly carried to the credit of the account, in&s;tead of the &pound;85, which <HI>is</HI> carried out. For this rea&s;on no le&s;s than the &s;um of &pound;.255 &s;hould be yet added to the balance as &s;tated. Had the calculation been made on an allowance of <HI>compound</HI> intere&s;t, in which money (at the &s;ame rate) doubles it&s;elf in le&s;s than 12 years, the balance would have been &s;till much increa&s;ed; but <HI>that</HI> method is rejected, as what many might di&s;approve, although from what follows, it will appear, that monies put out on intere&s;t in the common way, cannot with near &s;o much propriety, be entitled to <HI>compound</HI> inte|re&s;t, as in this in&s;tance, where the money is in con&s;tant circulation. Now, that all the monies depo&s;ited on manumi&s;&s;ion will be &s;ecure and <HI>con&s;tantly</HI> in u&s;e, and therefore entitled to intere&s;t, is evident when it is con|&s;idered, that the &s;ums &s;o depo&s;ited, are paid for the im|mediate u&s;e of the poor: For, if &pound;.25 be paid on the manumi&s;&s;ion of 10 negroes, age 26 years, in any town&s;hip, &s;o much le&s;s than the u&s;ual <HI>poor tax,</HI> will be collected from the inhabitants of that town&s;hip; there|fore each <HI>taxable</HI> retains in his own hands <HI>his</HI> proportionable part of the &s;aid &pound;.25, and &s;o will continue to do, in all probability, for 34 years; at which period it is &s;uppo&s;ed, <HI>one</HI> of the negroes may fir&s;t require a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance; and <HI>then</HI> every inhabitant fir&s;t pays a proportion|able part of his &s;hare of the &s;aid &pound;.25 left or retain|ed in his hands 34 years, as above-mentioned; and as money is univer&s;ally allowed to be worth its intere&s;t in whatever hands it may be, it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed he has made &s;uch u&s;e of it, as may well enable him to pay the whole &s;um with its intere&s;t, when it may be called for to furni&s;h the nece&s;&s;ary a&s;&s;i&s;tance to one of the&s;e <HI>Paupers.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="042395_0008_101BD8F661B71E68">On the whole&mdash;it appears by the account as &s;tated, that the publick <HI>receives</HI> &pound;.581 15s. more than it <HI>pays,</HI> for 70 negroes manumitted; and that if we admit a more equitable way of reckoning the intere&s;t, we mu&s;t add to that balance &pound;.255 more, which would make it &pound;.836 15s.</P>
<P>THEN to &s;hew what the annual &s;um, to &s;ecure the pub|lick on a manumi&s;&s;ion after the age of 21 years, &s;hould be we &s;ay, if the depo&s;it money is fixed at 10s. per annum , it leaves the balance of &pound;581 150</P>
<P>BUT allowing the intere&s;t to form a <HI>prin|cipal &s;um</HI> after 16 years and 2 thirds of a year, the balance is &pound;.836 150</P>
<P>THEN in the fir&s;t ca&s;e, the depo&s;it money may be reduced to 5&s; 4&frac12; per annum.</P>
<P>IN the la&s;t ca&s;e to 4&s; 5&frac14; per annum.</P>
<P>OTHERWISE, in the fir&s;t ca&s;e each negro will pay &pound;.8 6 2&frac12; more than</P>
<P>IN the la&s;t &pound;.11 190&frac14; more than</P>
<P>is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ecure the publick from their ever becom|ing burden&s;ome.</P>
<P>IF either the premi&s;es here &s;aid down, or the infer|ences made therefrom, &s;hould be found wrong, it would be e&s;teemed a &s;ervice done to the cau&s;e of Liberty, to have the errors pointed out in one of the publick papers; for thought an indulge is wi&s;hed to be granted to &s;uch as are con&s;cientiou&s;ly &s;crupulous of holding their fellow-creatures in perpetual bondage; it is rea&s;onable that the publick, at the &s;ame time, &s;hould be cautiously guarded again&s;t any injurious con&s;equences.</P>
