<HEAD>A SERMON.</HEAD>
<P>THIS day, which has for many years been ob|&s;erved with pious gratitude and joy, and con|&s;ecrated to &s;ocial fe&s;tivity as giving birth to &s;o emi|nent a per&s;on as General GEORGE WASHING|TON, is now turned into the deepe&s;t grief and mourning on account of his final departure from this terre&s;trial &s;tate. That I may aid and a&s;&s;i&s;t you in a due performance of the duties of the day, and in a religious improvement of &s;o affecting and pain|ful an event in Divine Providence, I have &s;elected tho&s;e words of the &s;acred hi&s;torian to di&s;cour&s;e up|on, which you find recorded in

<PB N="6" REF="039095_0004_10139AB8DF9382E8" MS="y">
DAYS: SO THE DAYS OF WEEPING AND MOURNING FOR MOSES WERE ENDED.</P></Q></P>
<P>This Mo&s;es was rai&s;ed up, by GOD, to be the principal in&s;trument, in the hands of Providence, of redeeming the people of I&s;rael from Egyptian bondage, of leading them through the wilderne&s;s for the &s;pace of forty years, and conducting them to the borders of the promi&s;ed land. But it was the will of Heaven that Mo&s;es &s;hould not go over Jordan. He was, indeed indulged with a view of that plea&s;ant, good and fruitful land which the Jews were &s;oon to enter and po&s;&s;e&s;s; and he &s;aw the happy pro&s;pects before them of enjoying relig|ion and government, peace, liberty and plenty, unexampled pro&s;perity and happine&s;s in the land of Canaan: But he mu&s;t not live to enjoy them him&s;elf. For GOD had expre&s;sly &s;aid unto him, "Get the up unto Mount Nebo, and die in the Mount whither thou goe&s;t up." "So Mo&s;es the Servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD." Then, &s;ays the &s;acred writer, as in the text, <HI>"And the children of I&s;rael wept for Mo&s;es, in the plains of Moab, thirty days: So the days of weeping and mourning for Mo&s;es were ended."</HI></P>
<P>From which words I ob&s;erve&mdash;that it accords with the divine will that a whole people &s;hould be
<PB N="7" REF="039095_0005_10139ABDE9EB5A90" MS="y">
deeply affected with, and mourn and lament, the death of eminent per&s;ons, &s;uch as have been pub|lic ble&s;&s;ings, great benefactors to the human race, and been made in&s;truments of redeeming a people from mi&s;ery and wretchedne&s;s, and of vindicating them into freedom and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>This appears from the following con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place; it is natural to the human race to be &s;en&s;ible of, to be much affected with, and to be grieved and pained at heart, upon the removal of any earthly comfort and ble&s;&s;ing; and e&s;pecially of any near relative, or great friend and benefactor:&mdash;And what is thus natural cannot be &s;inful; (unle&s;s our grief and lamentation be indulg|ed to exce&s;s, and we refu&s;e to be comforted,) but it is lawful, nay commendable and truly ornamental, and agreeable to the will of the wi&s;e Author of our frame and con&s;titution. To be unaffected in &s;uch ca&s;es would argue a great in&s;en&s;ibility of the worth and value of &s;uch gifts and that we were not &s;uffi|ciently grateful to GOD for be&s;towing them up|on us; and further, it would fru&s;trate &s;ome of the important moral purpo&s;es of the righteous Gover|nor of the world in their removal. Such feelings have been &s;anctified and &s;anctioned by JESUS CHRIST, our great pattern and exemplar, who, in the days of his fle&s;h, and when he dwelt among
<PB N="8" REF="039095_0006_10139ABF713C2810" MS="y">
men, wept upon the death of his intimate and en|deared friend Lazarus.</P>
<P>Such grief and lamentation has been ob&s;erved from the beginning: And e&s;pecially has the mourn|ing been great and general upon the removal of any eminent and good per&s;on, who had been a benefactor of mankind and a ble&s;&s;ing to the world. This appears from divers &s;cripture in&s;tances. When Jacob, who al&s;o was called I&s;rael, died, all the children of I&s;rael, and all the Egyptians mourned for him three&s;core and ten days: "And when the Canaanites &s;aw the mourning, they &s;aid this is a grievous mourning." So al&s;o, it is &s;aid "When all the congregation &s;aw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the hou&s;e of I&s;rael." So when that eminent king Jo&s;iah died, it is thus written, "All Judah and Jeru&s;alem mourned for Jo&s;iah. And Jere|miah lamented for Jo&s;iah: And all the &s;inging men and &s;inging women &s;pake of Jo&s;iah in their la|mentations, and made them an ordinance in I&s;rael." There are other in&s;tances recorded in the bible; but I mu&s;t not &s;top to mention them. This of Mo&s;es &s;poken of in the text and context, is very full and particular. The whole nation of the jews deeply lamented the death of this man, who had been &s;uch a mighty in&s;trument, under GOD, of
<PB N="9" REF="039095_0007_10139AC1F6E99A18" MS="y">
their temporal redemption and &s;alvation. And that &s;uch mourning and lamentation were agreeable to the divine will, appears, further, from tho&s;e in|&s;tances wherein every thing of this kind upon the death of per&s;ons of an oppo&s;ite character was ex|pre&s;sly prohibited by GOD him&s;elf: He declared that no &s;uch tokens of re&s;pect and regard for them &s;hould be manife&s;ted: As in the ca&s;e of Aaron's two &s;ons, Nadab and Abihu, who, for offering &s;trange fire before the LORD, were immediately devoured by fire from the LORD: And GOD forbids Aaron and his other &s;ons mourning for them at all. It &s;eems that thirty days was the length of time in general, in which they exhibited their &s;igns and badges of mourning for their dead. But it does not appear that GOD gave any expre&s;s &s;tatute to I&s;rael, that they &s;hould mourn ju&s;t that term of time for per&s;ons of eminence and di&s;tinc|tion, and who had been great ble&s;&s;ings to the na|tion, and to the world. Neverthele&s;s, it was no doubt from &s;ome divine intimation that they were led to ob&s;erve &s;o many days for public mourning. The in&s;tances referred to above, are recorded in &s;acred hi&s;tory with evident marks of the divine ap|probation, as what was highly proper, and as be|coming the relation and condition of mankind; they &s;how that this was a "rea&s;onable &s;ervice."</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="039095_0008_10139AC37B9A9738" MS="y">From the text and what has been &s;aid, we may infer, that it becomes us, that it becomes the peo|ple of the&s;e United States, to mourn and lament the death of that great and good man, General GEORGE WASHINGTON, who was, indeed, to this people a Mo&s;es, in many re&s;pects.</P>
<P>But in a religious di&s;cour&s;e of this kind, we mu&s;t previou&s;ly remark, that it is highly proper that we look above means, in&s;truments and &s;econd cau&s;es; to the great fir&s;t cau&s;e of all things, to the Supreme Arbiter and the Sovereign di&s;po&s;er of all events which take place throughout the Univer&s;e; and to eye and acknowledge the hand of the Almighty in all this, from the very fir&s;t to the very la&s;t.</P>
<P>GOD works by means and in&s;truments. When I&s;rael mu&s;t go down into Egypt to &s;ojourn there, Jo&s;eph was conducted thither, by the unerring hand of heaven, to be an in&s;trument of their &s;up|ply and &s;upport, pre&s;ervation and &s;alvation. How|ever unnatural and unju&s;tifiable the means by which Jo&s;eph was at fir&s;t brought into Egypt, "GOD meant it unto good, to &s;ave much people alive."</P>
<P>When the people of I&s;rael, after four hundred and thirty years, were to be redeemed from cruel Egyptian bondage, then Mo&s;es was brought upon the &s;tage, and being of mature age, GOD &s;ent him
<PB N="11" REF="039095_0009_10139AC72468F7F8" MS="y">
to be the ruler and deliverer of his cho&s;en people. He was furni&s;hed by the author of his exi&s;tence, with proper talents and gifts to be their leader, their captain, general, and commander in chief:&mdash;And be&s;ides being "learned in all the wi&s;dom of the Egyptians;" he was divinely in&s;tructed to be their lawgiver and judge&punc; And was a man approved of GOD among them, by myracles and &s;igns and wonders, which GOD did, by him, in the mid&s;t of them. GOD led that people through the wilder|ne&s;s, for the &s;pace of forty years, through the min|i&s;try of Mo&s;es, until they came to the borders of the promi&s;ed land.</P>
<P>When the reformation from Popery was to com|mence, GOD prepared his in&s;truments. He rai&s;|ed up and brought upon the theatre proper per|&s;ons to effect the &s;ame, as Luther, Calvin, Wick|liff, John Hu&s;s, Jerome, and a large catalogue of others.</P>
<P>When the&s;e United States, but then Briti&s;h prov|inces, were groaning under the oppre&s;&s;ive acts of the parliament of England, and when the mea&s;ure of her cruelties was full and running over, and could no longer have been borne, without haz|arding all our rights liberties and property:&mdash;And when we mu&s;t &s;tand forth in their defence, or &s;ub|mit to be bound by the acts of the Briti&s;h Legi&s;|lature
<PB N="12" REF="039095_0010_10139ACAB9BF4F58" MS="y">
in all ca&s;es what&s;oever:&mdash;Then GOD, "who &s;ees the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things not yet done;" brought our WASHINGTON upon the &s;tage, and of ma|ture age, and well furni&s;hed with natural talents, and acquired accompli&s;hments to act a mo&s;t con&s;pic|uous part upon the theatre of the world. Being born on the 11th of February, 1732, old &s;tyle, he was but a little more than 43 years of age, when the war between Great Britain and the&s;e American Colonies, commenced. He was then a member of Congre&s;s for his native &s;tate, and every eye of that augu&s;t body was directed to him as the mo&s;t &s;uitable per&s;on, to be the head and leader of our armies. For this high and mo&s;t intere&s;ting &s;tation, he was, on many accounts, the be&s;t qualified, of any man in North America, and probably in the world; being then in his full &s;trength and glory, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing tho&s;e great military talents, which had been matured by age, and the experience of &s;everal years of actual &s;ervice in American wars; being but about eighteen years of age when he be|gan his military career in Virginia, his native State. In the year 1755 he came into more general no|tice, when he acted as Aid-decamp to the unfortu|nate General BRADDOCK, who was killed in the We&s;tern Territory, in the beginning of the la&s;t
<PB N="13" REF="039095_0011_10139ACC43D7E6E8" MS="y">
French and Briti&s;h war on this Continent; and who&s;e army had then been entirely de&s;troyed, had not HIS martial &s;kill and prowe&s;s &s;aved a remnant, as &s;ome of you, advanced in life, can remember. Various rea&s;ons combined to lead the American Congre&s;s to make choice of him: He had already manife&s;ted great abilities as a commander, in di|vers trying &s;ituations: He was a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of very large and mo&s;t exten&s;ive property, which was at &s;take as well as the deare&s;t intere&s;ts of his coun|try: He was a man of a cool and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate temper, and of a moderate di&s;po&s;ition, and yet firm in his country's cau&s;e;&mdash;acting upon principle, and from a clear and full conviction in his own mind, that we were injured and wronged by the parent State; and, finally, he was a man of un|corruptible integrity and honor, in whom the full|e&s;t confidence might be placed, if he entered upon a &s;tation of &s;uch high re&s;pon&s;ibility. That he was formed and furni&s;hed, by the wi&s;e author of our being, "who di&s;tributeth to every man &s;everal|ly as he will," to &s;erve his country in the military department, was apparent from his earlie&s;t youth; and his military genius he cultivated and improv|ed by reading, ob&s;ervation and experience. And in the cour&s;e of our revolutionary war, his martial &s;pirit, genius and talents, were fully tried in divers
<PB N="14" REF="039095_0012_10139ACED147F728" MS="y">
critical and important &s;ituations, and, through the favor of heaven, they were found &s;uperior to ev|ery difficulty and ob&s;tacle which he had to encoun|ter. In a word, when the future, faithful, impar|tial hi&s;torian &s;hall record and dwell upon the fol|lowing facts, that he at fir&s;t, only headed a body of men entirely unacquainted with military di&s;cipline or operations, untaught in the principles of ju&s;t &s;ubordination; but &s;anguine in tho&s;e of liberty:&mdash; That, at be&s;t, they could only be &s;tiled an alert and good militia, acting under very &s;hort enli&s;tments, poorly &s;upplied with cloathing, arms or military &s;tores: And that with &s;uch an army he with&s;tood the ravages and progre&s;s of near forty thou&s;and vet|eran troops, plentifully provided with every nece&s;|&s;ary article, commanded by the brave&s;t officers in Europe, and &s;upported by a very powerful navy, which effectually prevented all movements of ours by water:&mdash;When, I &s;ay, the&s;e things &s;hall be im|partially related and weighed, WASHINGTON will be unanimou&s;ly pronounced the greate&s;t Gen|eral of the age in which he lived, or of any who had gone before him, and that his name will command the applau&s;e and admiration of the late&s;t po&s;terity.</P>
<P>"Many nations have been favoured with &s;ome patriotic deliverer:&mdash;The I&s;raelites had their Mo|&s;es:&mdash;Rome had her Camillus:&mdash;Greece her Le|onidas:
<PB N="15" REF="039095_0013_10139AD27B6D3608" MS="y">
&mdash;Sweden her Gu&s;tavus:&mdash;And England her Hamdens, her Ru&s;&s;ells, and her Sydneys: But the&s;e illu&s;trious heroes, though &s;ucce&s;sful in pre|&s;erving and defending, did not, like WASHING|TON, form and e&s;tabli&s;h empires, which we hope, will be the refuge of the oppre&s;&s;ed, and the a&s;ylum of liberty to the end of time."</P>
<P>You mu&s;t not expect that I give you a narra|tive of the various events of the war: This is more proper for the hi&s;tory of his life, than for a &s;ermon. No doubt the life of General WASHINGTON, his great and noble acts, the might and wi&s;dom he &s;hewed, and how he warred, and all that he did, will be written in a book of the Chronicles of the Pat|riots and Generals, the Pre&s;idents and Worthies of America, and which will be read with avidity and delight by all grateful Americans of every age.</P>
<P>Let it &s;uffice for me to &s;ay, that he was always care|ful and tender of the lives of the &s;oldiery:&mdash;And they in return, confided in, loved and cheerfully obeyed him:&mdash;That he never hazzarded a battle but where there was the greate&s;t human probability of &s;ucce&s;s:&mdash;That he gained divers important victories without much fighting, and &s;ometimes without the &s;hedding of blood. GOD evidently owned him as his in&s;trument of &s;aving the&s;e States from the hands of our enemies, of redeeming us from cruel
<PB N="16" REF="039095_0014_10139AD406ABAC10">
oppre&s;&s;ion and bondage, of procuring our inde|pendence, of &s;ecuring our ine&s;timable rights, lib|erties and priviledges, both civil and religious, and of enabling us to take our rank among the Nations of the Earth. Through his wi&s;e and &s;uperior gen|eral&s;hip, the war was conducted to a happy and glorious i&s;&s;ue in about eight years:&mdash;A much &s;horter &s;pace than we could rationally have expect|ed. And then he nobly re&s;igned his command in 1783, and returned to enjoy the &s;weets of retirment, and to pur&s;ue the agricultural arts wherein he great|ly delighted.</P>
<P>But here he was not &s;uffered long to re&s;t: For when the confederation was found inefficient to our &s;ecurity, honor and happine&s;s, and a national convention was called for, General WASHING|TON was cho&s;en a member:&mdash;And when conven|ed, he was elected pre&s;ident of that wi&s;e, faithful and augu&s;t body, who formed our pre&s;ent excel|ent con&s;titution of government, which is the boa&s;t of Americans, the envy of many nations, and the admiration of the world:&mdash;And under the benign influence of which, we have ri&s;en to an a&s;toni&s;hing height of national opulence and glory, pro&s;perity and happine&s;s. When this form of government was put in operation, General WASHINGTON
<PB N="17" REF="039095_0015_10139AD699236CC0">
received the unanimous &s;uffrages of all the &s;tates to be our fir&s;t magi&s;trate and &s;upreme executive. Here he pre&s;ided eight years, (from April 30th, 1789, to March 4th 1797) with great wi&s;dom and dignity, and made the government and people of America re&s;pected through the world. In all his public conduct he &s;eemed as one in&s;pired and di|rected of heaven. He had an amazing influence over the public mind; and guided their mea&s;ures without appearing &s;o to do. He had great knowl|edge of human nature; could &s;ee far into the views of men; and in mo&s;t ca&s;es knew in whom to con|fide. In the clo&s;e of the year 1796 he declin|ed being a candidate for the pre&s;idency, at the then en&s;uing election, choo&s;ing to retire from pub|lic life, and took his leave, in a mo&s;t affectionate farewell addre&s;s to the people, which does honor to his head and heart;&mdash;which ought to be in ev|ery hou&s;e and imprinted on the memory of every acting citizen. <HI>This</HI> &s;hews him to have been a great &s;tate&s;man and politician. The &s;entiments therein contained, may &s;erve as a political ther|mometer and ought to be as a pole &s;tar to form and guide the political opinions and conduct of every lover of his country's independence, honor and glo|ry, and of every friend to man.</P>
<P>But in his longed for retirement he was not &s;uffered
<PB N="18" REF="039095_0016_10139AD8223F5198">
to remain. When the&s;e United States were load|ed with in&s;ults and abu&s;es, and endured the ba&s;e&s;t &s;poliations, from a haughty, faithle&s;s, in&s;idious na|tion; and we were likely to be driven into war in &s;elf-defence, General WASHINGTON was ap|pointed, by Pre&s;ident ADAMS, to the command of all our military forces, which he readily accepted, in his advanced age, if thereby he could &s;erve his country. This was a mo&s;t judicious appoint|ment: &mdash;For he was as an ho&s;t of him&s;elf:&mdash;Our enemies trembled at his very name:&mdash;And a&s;ton|i&s;hment took hold of them, when they found he would &s;erve in that high and important &s;tation.</P>
<P>And here we mu&s;t be careful to mention, that from the year 1775, to his death, he utterly de|clined receiving any other compen&s;ation for his public &s;ervices in the cau&s;e of his country, than on|ly the defraying his nece&s;&s;ary expences, which greatly heightened our national obligations to him. THIS is what few men could have done, and what we have no right to expect of any, &s;ince all have a ju&s;t claim to an equivalent for whatever &s;ervices they render the people.</P>
<P>But to return; in the high office, of Lieutenant General and Commander of our armies, was he act|ing when a &s;udden death, after a few hours illne&s;s, arre&s;ted him, at his &s;eat at Mount Vernon, on the
<PB N="19" REF="039095_0017_10139ADBBA878540">
14th of December 1799, in the 68th year of his age. His death in this day of our doubtful expectations, notwith&s;tanding he was grown grey in his country's &s;ervice, may be a far greater lo&s;s to this land than we are now apprehen&s;ive of: For whether we &s;hall be driven into war or not, is yet uncertain.</P>
<P>But let us not de&s;pond;&mdash;let us place a rational tru&s;t in the everla&s;ting GOD, who has been our helper hitherto:&mdash;And who &s;ays, "Put not your tru&s;t in princes, nor in the &s;on of man, in whom there is no help: His breath goeth forth, he re|turneth to his earth: In that very day his thoughts peri&s;h. Happy are they who have the GOD of Jacob for their help; who&s;e hope is in the LORD their GOD, who made heaven and earth, the &s;ea and all which therein is: Who keepeth truth for|ever." This GOD, who has begun to &s;ave us, will not leave nor for&s;ake us, if we do not provoke him, by denying the GOD who made us, and lightly e&s;teeming the rock of our &s;alvation. Had the LORD been minded, to de&s;troy this land he would not have conducted us hitherto, nor have wrought for us &s;uch great deliverances as in years which are pa&s;t. With Him is the re&s;idue of the &s;pirit; he is able to rai&s;e up others who &s;hall do wor|thily and well in the cabinet and in the field. We need not di&s;tre&s;s our&s;elves, for as Mo&s;es &s;aw Jo&s;hua
<PB N="20" REF="039095_0018_10139ADF865621A0">
appointed his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, and GOD &s;aid to him "As I was with Mo&s;es, &s;o will I be with thee;" So WASHINGTON &s;aw his &s;ucce&s;&s;or in the Pre&s;i|dency, and to him could cheerfully leave the care of this people, knowing his &s;uperior abilities, un|&s;haken integrity, and di&s;intere&s;ted patrioti&s;m. We have an ADAMS at the head of our national gov|ernment, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great talents, following the &s;teps of his illu&s;trious predece&s;&s;or; a man of &s;trict virtue, of real piety and true goodne&s;s; and who has given many unequivocal proofs of his firm at|tachment to the be&s;t intere&s;ts, pro&s;perity and glo|ry of his native country.</P>
<P>Before I conclude my di&s;cour&s;e, I would ob&s;erve that while I have not the remote&s;t inclination, di&s;|po&s;ition or idea to detract from the merit, prai&s;e and glory of General WASHINGTON, yet I think there is occa&s;ion to &s;ugge&s;t two cautions;&mdash;One is, that we guard again&s;t every thing that favors idolatry. In the writings of &s;ome Panegyri&s;ts upon this great and good man, we find expre&s;&s;ions which, when the feelings and pa&s;&s;ions of men &s;ub&s;ide, they cannot approve or ju&s;tify: And conveying ideas which WASHINGTON him&s;elf, could he hear them and reply, would di&s;claim. We &s;hould remember that GOD formed him with all his

bright a&s;&s;emblage of talents lent him to us, pre|&s;erved his important life &s;o long and made him all that to us which he was, even an ornament and ble&s;|&s;ing to his country. While then, we highly extol the man, and celebrate his great and patriotic deeds, let us ultimately a&s;cribe the glory and prai&s;e to the Mo&s;t High GOD.</P>
<P>In the next place, we &s;hould guard again&s;t a&s;|cribing all, or too much, to one man. General WASHINGTON may be ju&s;tly viewed as one of the fir&s;t and greate&s;t in&s;truments of the temporal &s;alvation and happine&s;s of his country: But ma|ny others members of Congre&s;s and officers and &s;oldiers in the army, contributed their &s;hare, ac|cording to their rank and &s;tation, to the emanci|pation, independence and pro&s;perity of the&s;e Unit|ed States. And <HI>this</HI> General WASHINGTON was always careful to allow and acknowledge. And throughout his whole life he manife&s;ted this act of piety, that he was always &s;en&s;ible of, and failed not to acknowledge that overruling Provi|dence of GOD which made him an in&s;trument of &s;o much good to the world, and which always ap|peared to &s;econd his wi&s;hes and &s;mile upon his ex|ertions to &s;erve and &s;ave his country. And when clo&s;ing his eyes upon earth, and looking forward into the eternal world, (being in the full exerci&s;e of
<PB N="22" REF="039095_0020_10139AE3BA8333C8">
his rea&s;on) might he not humbly &s;ay and pray, "Remember me, O my GOD, for good, accord|ing to all that I have done for this people."</P>
<P>And now, in the mid&s;t of all the &s;orrow and grief we ought to expre&s;s at the removal of this fir&s;t of mere men from this world, let us never forget to manife&s;t our gratitude to the all-wi&s;e Former of our bodies and Father of our &s;pirits, for his good|ne&s;s and benevolence in rai&s;ing up &s;uch a per&s;on to adorn and di&s;criminate the eighteenth century; and that he &s;o richly endowed and &s;o abundantly, furni&s;hed him to become &s;o great and exten&s;ive a ble&s;&s;ing to this land. And, in particular, that when jeoparding his life in the high places of the field, when leading our armies, and fighting our battles, GOD covered his head, held him as in the hollow of his hand, kept him as the apple of his eye, and pre&s;erved his life through a long and di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing war, and made him &s;o great an in&s;trument of &s;ecuring to us our ine&s;timable rights, liberties, and privileges, and of e&s;tabli&s;hing us as an inde|pendent nation:&mdash;And al&s;o that he did pre&s;erve and capacitate him to be a rich ble&s;&s;ing to the&s;e &s;tates in the civil department, as their fir&s;t magi&s;trate and &s;upreme executive officer; and that under his wi&s;e and good admini&s;tration, in conjunction with
<PB N="23" REF="039095_0021_10139AE653926040" MS="y">
others in government, we could lead quiet and peaceable lives, and have been a growing, pro&s;per|ous and happy people:&mdash;And, further, that GOD did protract his days almo&s;t to the allotted bound|ary of human life, to &s;hare in the enjoyment of the &s;weets of liberty and peace, and all the rich ble&s;|&s;ings he was &s;o in&s;trumental of procuring and e&s;|tabli&s;hing for this land.</P>
<P>And? Shall not the death of this eminent per&s;on, after having &s;erved his generation by the will of GOD in various high and exalted &s;tations, remind all in our national and &s;tate governments, who are rai&s;ed up among their brethren to places of power and tru&s;t, whether in the legi&s;lative, judicial, execu|tive or military departments, that although they are called Gods, and all of them children of the Mo&s;t High, yet they mu&s;t die like men, and fall like the princes of the earth into the grave. May they remember their re&s;pon&s;ibility to GOD who is higher than the highe&s;t among men:&mdash;And con|&s;ider that he &s;tandeth in the congregation of the mighty, and judgeth among the earthly Gods. May the&s;e thoughts engage them to be in&s;tant in the faithful di&s;charge of the duties of their re&s;pec|tive &s;tations, and improving their various talents, advantages and opportunities for bringing glory to
<PB N="24" REF="039095_0022_10139AE9E63F7160">
GOD, and contributing each his ju&s;t proportion to increa&s;e the &s;um of human felicity. May a double portion of that excellent &s;pirit which dwelt in our WASHINGTON re&s;t upon each of them, and all their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in office, from age to age:&mdash; May they be actuated by a &s;pirit of true and di&s;|intere&s;ted patrioti&s;m, and unitedly and uniformly exert their power and influence to rai&s;e their coun|try to &s;till higher degrees of pro&s;perity and glory:&mdash; Thus &s;hall they become mini&s;ters of GOD for good to the people; rai&s;e to them&s;elves a monument of fame on earth, and be exalted to a crown of glory in heaven.</P>
<P>Finally, while we mourn the death of WASH|INGTON, and particularly becau&s;e he loved our nation, and had done &s;uch great things for this peo|ple, let us all, of whatever age, rank or &s;tation, remember to imitate the virtues and deeds which have immortalized his name, according to our re&s;|pective abilities and opportunities. Like him let us be animated with an ardent love to our country, and exhibit the mo&s;t unremitted exertions to pro|mote and perpetuate its intere&s;t and pro&s;perity. Let us remember his &s;age maxims in his farewell addre&s;s, and practice upon them. They are the&s;e, "Of all the di&s;po&s;itions and habits which lead to political pro&s;perity, religion and morality are indi&s;|pen&s;able
<PB N="25" REF="039095_0023_10139AEB6D0C0350" MS="y">
&s;upports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patrioti&s;m, who &s;hould labor to &s;ub|vert the&s;e great pillars of human happine&s;s, the&s;e firme&s;t props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to re&s;pect and cheri&s;h them. A volume could not trace all their connexions with public and private felicity. Let it be &s;imply a&s;ked, where is the &s;ecurity for property, for reputation, for life, if a &s;en&s;e of religious obligations de&s;ert the oaths which are the in&s;truments of inve&s;tigation in courts of ju&s;tice? And let us with caution indulge the &s;uppo&s;ition that morality can be maintained with|out religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar &s;tructure; rea&s;on and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclu|&s;ion of religious principle." Could all this peo|ple, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, emulate the virtues of a WASHINGTON, and ob&s;erve the&s;e his wi&s;e &s;ayings, then GOD would delight to ble&s;s us, to build us up, and plant us, cau&s;e us to &s;ee the good of his cho&s;en, to rejoice in the gladne&s;s of his nation, to glory with his inheritance:&mdash;The days of our mourning would cea&s;e, and our peace|ful, happy pro&s;perous &s;tate &s;hould not, but with time it&s;elf, have an end.</P>
