<HEAD>The La&s;t Words, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS born in the back parts of Virginia, where I lived by the name of Peter, till I arrived to the age of manhood. My ma&s;ter, was called Lawyer Jones, who treated me like a &s;lave. I began early to take things from my ma&s;ter, &amp; when I was found out, he whipped me, or ordered the negro driver to do it; but &s;till I con|tinued &s;tealing, and lying to hide it. At length I ran away from my ma&s;|ter, and kept in the woods by day, and by night &s;tole bread, meat, and other things from the neighbours. I was caught &amp; whipped &s;everal times. I then went to another county, where I continued near a year, living with Mr. William Scott, as a waiter. Here I followed my old practice of &s;tealing, and kept a woman. Di&s;o|beying my ma&s;ter, he threatned to
<PB N="4" REF="047425_0003_1023A39F377FB3E0">
whip me; but I ran away, and went to Mr. William M'Donald's in Dum|phries county, where I continued my practice of taking things and lying with women. Thence I went to Louden county, changing my name every time I changed my place. Here I went by the name of Shadrach, and hired my&s;elf to Mr. Abraham, Milton, a waggoner. I continued in this county about 3 or 4 years, taking things that were not my own, and lying with women, by whom I had children. From thence went to A|lexandria, and &s;hipped by the name of Edmund, with Samuel Love, and Hugh Stuart, merchants, for Liver|pool in England. While the &s;hip was unloading, &s;ome flour was mi&s;&s;|ing, and I being &s;u&s;pected and threat|ned puni&s;hment, tho' innocent of the crime, ran away and engaged on board an English &s;hip, went to Green|land, and thence came to Wi&s;ca&s;&s;ett. On the pa&s;&s;age I took things, but was not found out. At Wi&s;ca&s;&s;ett I &s;tole
<PB N="5" REF="047425_0004_1023A3A0C9B06090">
bread, &amp;c. out of the &s;hip, which I &s;old, and was detected. I ran away from the &s;hip and was caught; but running away a &s;econd time, I went to Swan I&s;land on Kenebeck river, and thence to Hallowell, where I &s;troled about from place to place, having no home or employment for &s;ome time. Here I &s;tole wheat and &s;ome meat from Col. Dutton, and fre|quently &s;tole from the neighbours. About this time I married Lydia, and lived in Hallowell on the ea&s;t &s;ide of Kenebeck river. Now my life was dreadful&mdash;Drinking, &s;tealing and gaming.</P>
<P>After about a year I moved to Va&s;|&s;alborough, where I continued my wicked cour&s;es for more than a year longer, until I committed the la&s;t hor|rid crimes again&s;t God, upon that poor PAMELA TILTON.&mdash;On Sun|day, the 18ht of May, the &s;un about two hours high in the afternoon, I began to carry &s;ome of my &s;tuff to a hou&s;e to which I had before de&s;igned

to move, and &s;eeing the track of a girl, as I &s;uppo&s;ed, thought that if I could meet with her, I would have my will of her. I &s;oon &s;aw her in a place where two ways met, and &s;tept a&s;ide till &s;he came near; then throw|ing my&s;elf into the way or road, &s;poke and &s;aid how do you do, let me lie with you: She an&s;wered, "no I was not brought up to &s;uch things." I then took her by the arm and carried her into the woods: She &s;creamed and to prevent her noi&s;e, I took hold of her throat, threw her down and committed a crime again&s;t innocence. She then a&s;ked me to &s;hew her the way home, or out of the woods: After I had my will of her the &s;econd time, &s;he begged me to carry her to her father's bars. To this I con&s;ented, if &s;he would not bring me out, but I carried her the wrong way. When &s;he &s;aw an opening (for it began to be dark) &s;he a&s;ked me if it were her father's and &s;aid "I am afraid you are going to carry me into the wilderne&s;s

to de&s;troy me." I promi&s;ed the<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> would not hurt her, though I <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> after attempted to put her to death but did not accompli&s;h it. I told her that I would &s;hew her the way home, if &s;he would not expo&s;e me: She &s;aid that &s;he would not; but fearful that &s;he would di&s;cover my crime, I took her by the throat, &s;trangled her, and endeavoured to hide the body under a log by covering it with &s;ome bark and rotten wood. But how &s;hall I de&s;cribe my feelings on my return home! Oh how dreadful they were! I could not re&s;t all night. The next morning I went to the place where I had hidden her body, in order to conceal it better; and as it was not far from the road I travelled in to move my goods, I could not help looking that way towards the body and thought if &s;he &s;hould be found, the neighbours would mi&s;tru&s;t me.&mdash;Search being made, the body was found on the next Tue&s;day: I was near and went to the place where the
<PB N="8" REF="047425_0007_1023A3ACE5864ED8">
<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> lay; and being &s;u&s;pected, was <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;eized and bound. At <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> I denied that I knew any thing about the matter, but m<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> guilt obliged me to confe&s;s, and I was committed to goal. I attempted every means to e&s;cape from pri&s;on, and had like to have got out.</P>
<P>On Friday, a little more than a week before I was araigned at the bar, I was in great di&s;tre&s;s of mind; and though I tried to &s;leep I could not; my di&s;tre&s;s of mind &s;eemed to parch me up; I thought the Lord had for|&s;aken me; that there was no mercy for me, who was &s;o guilty; then I believe I got into a drow&s;ine&s;s, and it &s;eemed as if my breath was taken from me, and when I came to my&s;elf, it &s;eemed as if my &s;pirit would fly a|way, and the Devil was with me and &s;aid "if you had killed your wife I &s;hould have had you." I an&s;wered no? Then I thought I heard a voice, &s;aying, "the Lord will have mercy." I tried to pray, but all my prayers
<PB N="9" REF="047425_0008_1023A3AFD774DA30">
rather made me wor&s;e than better. I continued &s;triving to pray, and as I u&s;ed to mock folks, and make games at them, &s;o I thought I was mocking God. For &s;ome time t<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> thought the Lord would have th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> mercy on me, who had no mercy <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> my fellow creature that was better than I; and as it was near day I thought I would lie down and try to &s;leep; but I could not re&s;t; there was no comfort or peace for me: I tho't no per&s;on was &s;o bad as I my whole life filled with &s;in, &s;tealing, lying, whoring and drinking, and now murder. At length I got up, and endeavoured to pray, but my heart was hard as a &s;tone, and it &s;eemed bound up; &s;till I thought I would keep praying to the Lord whether he had mercy on me or not.</P>
<P>On Saturday morning it &s;eemed as if I had more de&s;ire to pray and plead with God than before; and in the af|ternoon it &s;eemed as if my heart was in &s;ome degree melted, and there was
<PB N="10" REF="047425_0009_1023A3B3E7FEA5C0">
&s;ome hope. I heard &s;omething like a voice, &s;aying "verily verily give him a new heart," and it &s;eemed as if a man was in me working downward, and clearing or clean&s;ing my heart. I thought I could breathe out my heart to God, and could &s;ee a light &s;hining from heaven, brighter than &s;now, and in the light it &s;eemed as though a great many angels were &s;inging, which drowned my groans and pray|ers; and I cried O Lord! and look|ed up, and I &s;aw in a corner of the pri&s;on, &s;omething red like fire, and thought it was the Devil. I found I had another feeling, and I cried to the Lord. I now felt reliev|ed; but was doubtful whether it could be true that the Lord had mer|cy on me, and wanted to &s;ee the light again.</P>
<P>On Lord's day morning I felt more contented; but could hardly believe what I &s;aw, and felt. I looked out of the grates, and all things looked &s;trange, as it in another place; the
<PB N="11" REF="047425_0010_1023A3B58FF8FD40">
birds &s;eemed to come near the Goal and &s;ing. Putting my&s;elf in the &s;ame place where I fir&s;t law the light, I prayed, and &s;aid, O Lord, for thy dear Son Je&s;us &s;ake, who died for &s;in|ners, have mercy on me! And im|mediately the &s;ame angels began to &s;ing again; and I believed in the Lord, and loved every body. I felt cool and calm; all the dread and fear which I had &s;uffered were gone.</P>
<P>When I was brought to the bar, a gentleman &s;poke to me, and advi&s;|ed me to plead <HI>not guilty:</HI> Oh! I thought he wanted me to lie again&s;t God; and I con&s;idered how dreadful it was for a man that could read to give &s;uch advice. When the indict|ment was read, and the judge a&s;ked me whether I was guilty or not guil|ty, I felt very calm, and an&s;wered, guilty. And when I was brought the next day to hear my &s;entence, I felt perfectly re&s;igned and thankful to the court, God knows their &s;entence was ju&s;t. I now wait for the la&s;t &s;troke
<PB N="12" REF="047425_0011_1023A3B9A6569728">
of death. I can tru&s;t my &s;oul in the hands of the Lord, and am willing to do, or &s;uffer any thing God &s;hall lay upon me; and if he &s;hould ca&s;t me off, it will be right for I de&s;erve it.</P>
<P>And now, as a dying man, I recom|mend to the charity, of Chri&s;tian neighbours, my di&s;tre&s;&s;ed wife <HI>Lydia,</HI> whom I leave with two &s;mall child|ren, de&s;titute of every thing to help them&s;elves with, and &s;he big with child. And I de&s;ire the prayers of all good people to God for them and my&s;elf.</P>
