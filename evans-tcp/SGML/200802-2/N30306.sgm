<HEAD>THE DEFENCE OF JOHN URY, Made before the Supream Court in <HI>New-York,</HI> at his Tryal for being concerned in the late Negro-Con&s;piracy.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it plea&s;e the King's Judges, and you Gentlemen of the Jury,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_IT is very incongruous to Rea&s;on, to think I can have any Hand, or be any Way concerned in this Plot, if the&s;e Things be duly weighed, That after the Di&s;covery of the Con&s;piracy, and the Execution of many for it, that I &s;hould act &s;uch a lunatick Part, if I was guilty, as to continue in this City, join with Mr. <HI>Campbel,</HI> and not only &s;o, but publickly advertize my&s;elf for teaching of Grammar; yea further, that I &s;hould &s;till continue, even after the Caution Mr. <HI>Webb</HI> gave me, a Week and a few Days before I was taken into Cu&s;tody: He told me, that Mr. <HI>Chambers</HI> told him, that the Eyes of this City were fixed on me, and that I was &s;u&s;pected to be a <HI>Roman Prie&s;t,</HI> and thought to be in the Plot. I an&s;wered, my Innocency would protect me, I valued not what the World &s;aid in that Ca&s;e: Again, another In&s;tance that mu&s;t free me from this Plot, is, when Mr. <HI>Campbel</HI> went to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Hew&s;on</HI>'s Hou&s;e, his Daughter refu&s;ing to go out, and &s;wear|ing like a <HI>Life-Guard</HI> Man, I took up the Cau&s;e, Mr. <HI>Campbel</HI> not exerting him&s;elf as I thought was proper at that Time, and told her, that if &s;he would not go out quietly, I would take another Method with her, for I would have no &s;uch wicked Per&s;on live where I was to dwell. Now, Rea&s;on mu&s;t pronounce me Innocent, for had I been engaged in their Schemes, my Guilt, my Fears would have forced me to have acted in a very different Manner; rather to have &s;oothed her, and gave her Liberty to &s;tay till provided for, in&s;tead of not &s;hewing her the lea&s;t Countenance. And further, what corroborates my Non-Knowledge of this Plot, is, That the Negroe, who confe&s;s'd, as it is &s;aid, that he &s;et Fire to the Fort, did not mention me in all his Confe&s;&s;ion. If he was bound by any Oath or Oaths, as he confe&s;s'd it &s;hewed he thought it or them of no Value; doubtle&s;s he would have confe&s;s'd and laid open the whole Scheme, and all

the Per&s;ons he knew concerned in it, but more e&s;pecially the <HI>Prie&s;t,</HI> as is &s;aid I am. And what is &s;till more &s;trong for my Innocency, is, That neither <HI>Hew&s;on,</HI> his Wife, nor the Creature that was hanged with them, nor any that have been put to Death &s;ince, did once name me.</P>
<P>Certainly <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> if I am a <HI>Prie&s;t,</HI> as you take me to be, I could not be &s;o fooli&s;h to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gage my&s;elf in &s;o ab&s;urd a Contrivance, as to bind my&s;elf with a Cord, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or Negrees, or who are wor&s;e, pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ligate Whites, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of this Earth, &s;uperior in Villany to <HI>The Knights of the Po&s;t,</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a Halter for me.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI> as there is a great, unknown and tremendous Being, whom we call God, I never &s;aw <HI>Hew&s;on,</HI> his Wife, nor the Creature that was hanged with them, to my Knowledge, living, dying or dead; nor the Ne|groe that is &s;aid to have fired the Fort, excepting in his la&s;t Moments. But put the Ca&s;e, I had known <HI>Hew&s;on,</HI> and had been at his Hou&s;e, is it to be inferr'd from thence, that I mu&s;t be acquainted with his Villany, or know his Secrets? And as he kept a Publick Hou&s;e, which is open and free for all, is it rea&s;onable to think, that all, or any Man's being &s;een at <HI>Hew&s;on</HI>'s, mu&s;t make him or them culpable or chargeable with his Villany? Surely, No: For if &s;o, &s;ad would be the Ca&s;e of many Gentlemen, who, in travelling the Countries in <HI>England,</HI> have u&s;ed bad Hou&s;es or Inns, and lit into the Company of Highway-Men, who by their Garb and Con|ver&s;ation, they have taken for &s;ome hone&s;t Country Gentlemen or Trade&s;|men; and the&s;e Highway-Men have been taken up, while in Company, and yet tho&s;e Per&s;ons have not in the lea&s;t been &s;u&s;pected, much le&s;s come into any Trouble. But I fear all that this Trouble of mine &s;prings from, is grounded upon the Apprehen&s;ions of my being a <HI>Roman Prie&s;t,</HI> and therefore mu&s;t be a Plotter; for, &s;ay they in the Chain of general Woes, <HI>The fir&s;t and the la&s;t Link is mo&s;t commonly tied to the Prie&s;t's Girdle.</HI></P>
<P>But, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> I mu&s;t a&s;&s;ure you, from Reading and Conver&s;ation, I believe no Prie&s;t would hold Confederacy with Negroes; they are too wi&s;e, too cunning, to tru&s;t &s;uch Sort of Gentry. It is not Men of For|tune, good Sen&s;e, and Learning, they care to meddle with or entru&s;t, in &s;uch Affairs as Plots, excepting they be Men of their own Kidney, of their own Way of Thinking in Religion, &s;uppo&s;ing a Prie&s;t could be &s;o fooli&s;h, or become &s;o <HI>Non compos mentis,</HI> as to plot. In &s;hort, a Prie&s;t, a joint Contriver of Firing a Fort, a Celebrater of Ma&s;&s;es, a Di&s;pencer of Ab&s;o|lutions, as it is &s;aid I am, &s;o long pa&s;&s;ed by, &s;uch a particular Per&s;on, forgotten! No, Gentlemen, you mu&s;t think and believe, he would have been the next Per&s;on, after the Di&s;covery of the Plot, that would have been brought on the Carpet. And further, what is of great Note, is, That <HI>Hew&s;on,</HI> at the fir&s;t Di&s;covery of the Plot, was &s;worn to be the whole Projector and Carrier on of the Plot. And if the&s;e Witne&s;&s;es knew me &s;o well as they pretend to now, how came it about, what I not know any Thing of me before I came to Pri&s;on? Doubtle&s;s, they would have been eager to have betrayed me, when the Scheme was di&s;covered; for, being a Prie&s;t, and con&s;equently artful and cunning, they would have been afraid of my E&s;caping. No, if I had been engaged, they would have &s;oon informed, thinking to have &s;aved their own Lives, knowing how this Government &s;tands affected to &s;uch Gentlemen as I am &s;aid to be, namely, a Prie&s;t.</P>
