<HEAD>A SCHEME FOR A Paper Currency.</HEAD>
<P>_READING in &s;ome of the News-Papers, the la&s;t &s;itting of the Honourable A&s;&s;embly of this Province, of a Peti|tion &s;ign'd by a great Number of the Freeholders of this Town, was pre&s;ented to the Court, for Relief under their pre&s;ent difficult and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Circum&s;tances, for want of a &s;ufficient Medium; whereby the Trade and Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Town is very much decayed, Law-Suits increa&s;ed, and Ca&s;h to purcha&s;e the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life hard to be attained, even by many of good E&s;tates among them. It mu&s;t plainly appear, to a Mathematical Demon&s;tration, that nothing can help or relieve this Town out of its pre&s;ent great Difficulties and bad Circum&s;tances, but Frugality and Indu&s;try, and pur&s;uing ju&s;t and rea&s;onable Schemes. For any rea&s;onable Man living to think that the Printing a few Rheams of Paper, with|out the lea&s;t Shadow of Foundation, and calling it Money, will relieve them, they are va&s;tly mi&s;taken, it will only lead them into a va&s;t Labyrinth of Evils.</P>
<P>THE following Scheme will appear to a full Demon&s;tration what va&s;t Service it will be to this Town.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be allowed that a Number can perform more than a few, which is ju&s;t and r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;onable: For the Gentlemen in <HI>England, Holland</HI> and other Parts of the Trading World, form them&s;elves into SOCIETIES and COMPANIES for the carry|ing on <HI>va&s;t</HI> De&s;igns in Trade and Commerce. The <HI>Dutch</HI> are the only People
<PB N="2" REF="040159_0005_101630F7AED42CA8">
who have got Money by their fir&s;t Scheme: Their Maxims are thus, when they have a Mind to bring any Manufactury into their Country, they always procure the be&s;t Workmen from that Country where that Manufactury is carried on to the utmo&s;t Perfection. Having procured Workmen, they perform to tho&s;e Men their Engage|ments and Contracts to the lea&s;t Tittle: And tho&s;e Workmen finding them&s;elves ju&s;tly dealt withal, they directly bring that Manufactury to as great Perfection as it is carried on in the Country they came from. And thus from the&s;e wi&s;e Maxims, which the <HI>Dutch</HI> have followed, they have brought them to that glorious Figure which they now make in the World.</P>
<P><HI>NOW to my Scheme.</HI> There is the compleate&s;t Place for the Erecting and Build|ing Twenty Mills on of any Place I ever &s;aw in my Life; it is from the Warehou&s;e of JO<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> LEWIS, E&s;q. near the Fortification, acro&s;s to his Warehou&s;e on <HI>Dorche&s;ter</HI> Point. I &s;uppo&s;e, was it po&s;&s;ible, that &s;uch a Place could be procured as near <HI>Am&s;terdam</HI> as this is to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> would give <HI>One hundred Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> Sterling for &s;uch a convenient Place.</P>
<P>OUR <HI>Mother</HI> Country will be much pleas'd with this Scheme, becau&s;e not one Mill will interfere with any of the Manufactur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s in <HI>Great Britain.</HI> I &s;hall explain the great Benefit and Advantage of &s;undry of the&s;e Mills&punc; which by the Parity of Rea&s;on will explain the te&s;t. It's plain to a Demon&s;tration, that tho&s;e Corn Mills which are erected on the Mill Pond, will in a few Years be of no Service. The Rea&s;on is&punc; Be|cau&s;e the Pond fills &s;o fa&s;t with Filth, that there will not be &s;ufficient Water to carry on the &s;aid Mills. And &s;uch a fine, beautiful Tract of Land will be more fit to build Streets of Hou&s;es on&punc; and ten Times the Improvement than they are at pre&s;ent em|ploy'd in. And the&s;e Corn Mills (to be built on the aforementioned Place) may be built to the &s;ame Advantage as they are now in <HI>England.</HI> The Corn Mills have been va&s;tly improved in <HI>England</HI> within the&s;e Twenty Years. And tho&s;e Mills being built to the &s;ame Perfection they are now built in <HI>England,</HI> they will grind more Flour by &s;ix lb. Weight out of a Bu&s;hel of Wheat, and make better Flour, than any Mill now built in <HI>America.</HI> (For all the Mills now built in <HI>America,</HI> are built in the old Form) So that the Merchants of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> may purcha&s;e Wheat from the Wheat Countries, and &s;upply the <HI>We&s;t-Indies</HI> Cheaper than either <HI>New-York</HI> or <HI>Philadelphia.</HI> For the Tenth of the&s;e Fac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> I appeal to the Millers and Bakers of <HI>Bo&s;ton.</HI> A Number of Saw-Mills for the Ship Builders and Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ers, they will be able to de|mon&s;trate Leather Mills, the Gentlemen Leather-Sellers will be able to inform.

A Number of Logwood Mills, a Num|ber of Merchants will be able to inform: And &s;o by a Party of Rea&s;on all the re&s;t of the Mills are explained. The Place lies entirely on Water Carriage, and has a con&s;tant Supply of Water all the Summer, which is the only Time to perform Bu&s;i|ne&s;s. It has already been ju&s;tly Surveyed, and a Plan taken. And was a Number of Gentlemen to be incorporated by the General A&s;&s;embly, they might bring this Scheme to Perfection immediately, to the va&s;t Service of this Town and Province in general. I can with Mode&s;ty &s;ay, this is the be&s;t Scheme that ever was on the

Tapis &s;ince the Colony has been &s;ettled. It is not like the Uncertainty of the Min<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Adventurers, but as &s;oon as the&s;e Mills are built they will produce a certain Profit, as &s;ure as the Sun that moves. The Corn Mills at <HI>Bow</HI> near <HI>London,</HI> with twelve Pair of Stones, are let at <HI>Nine hundred Pounds</HI> Sterling a Year, and I will Mathe|matically prove, that twelve Pair of Stones built on the abovementioned Place will produce as much Profit as the Mills at <HI>Bow.</HI> And &s;uch a fine Scituation for Mills can|not be better in any Place in the World. There is now an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity for coming into a ju&s;t Scheme in order to have Money pa&s;s for a Supply of our com|mon Nece&s;&s;ities, till &s;uch time as by our Frugality and Dent of Indu&s;try we bring Silver and Gold to pa&s;s as a proper Medium; which was the real De&s;ign of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Maje&s;ty's Royal In&s;truction not to make any more Paper Bills, which is ab&s;olutely a common Cheat, let them be made in any Form or Shape whatever, without a &s;olid Foundation to &s;upport their Value.

I &s;hall only mention one Company in <HI>London,</HI> that is the <HI>New River</HI> Company, which pays them Twenty <HI>per Cent</HI> intere&s;t; then, would not the Notes of &s;uch a Company pa&s;s equal with Bank Notes, or Gold or Silver.

All Mechanicks are now brought to be proved by mathematical Demon&s;trations, &s;o that it is impo&s;&s;ible to err in building the&s;e Mills, for it may be computed to a &s;ingle Farthing what each Mill will co&s;t. And the&s;e Mills <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng built according to the Mathematicks, then it may be ea&s;ily demon&s;tra|ted what each Mill will produce yearly, &s;o that the Company may proceed like wi&s;e Ma&s;ter-Builders. And when the above Mills are brought to Perfection, a va&s;t Number of great Schemes may be laid before the Company, which they will natu|rally come into: For we have a common Proverb, <HI>Mathematical Demon&s;trations can a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> And it would certainly be for the intere&s;t of <HI>New-England</HI> not to make one Paper Bill m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re: The Rea&s;on is, The Notes of Head made by the Company will an&s;wer the Ends and Purpo&s;es of purcha&s;ing all the Nece&s;&s;aries of Life&punc; and the&s;e Notes not being made a Tender in Law, it would ab&s;olutely oblige the Merchants to bring Gold and Silver to an&s;wer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Specialties, or el&s;e it would be impo&s;&s;ible for them to carry on Trade and Merchandi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e.

Each Gentlemen will flatter him&s;elf he &s;hall be able to procure as many Bills as will an&s;wer all his De&s;igns. But any Man that knows the ju&s;t State of the Pro|vince mu&s;t allow that according to its pre&s;ent Scituation it requires a Million ready Specie to carry on the Trade of the Province: It is therefore a meer je&s;t to make a few Paper Bills, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">king that will an&s;wer the End, it will only embarra&s;s and entirely Ruin hundreds of Families, and bring on Law-Suits almo&s;t numberle&s;s. It mu&s;t be allow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d that a Merchant managed his Affairs with Prudence and Caution, when he has brought his Trading to &s;uch a Point that his Profits may be large, and his Lo&s;s not con&s;iderable. But &s;hould a Man of Traffick put <HI>Twenty thou&s;and Pounds</HI> on board a leaky Ve&s;&s;el, and &s;end it to the <HI>Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies,</HI> through as many Dangers as there are Shelves in the Sea, or Points in the Compa&s;s, with the

bare Hopes of gaining <HI>Six Peace,</HI> would not all Mankind po&s;t up &s;uch a Merchant for a mad Man: I leave the Application.</P>
<P>THIS Body Politick may be ju&s;tly compared to a Merchant beginning the World with <HI>One hundred Thou&s;and Pounds,</HI> and directly advanceth to a Trade that requires <HI>One Million</HI> ready Specie. Notwith&s;tanding the Merchant has an exceeding good Character in all Parts of the trading World, and his Credit &s;upported a va&s;t many Years with a fair Shew, yet in the End it will be the intire Ruin, not only of him|&s;elf, but of va&s;t Numbers of other Men. The Rea&s;on is, it is plain that for want of a &s;ufficient Sum to carry on his Trade, he is often obliged to part with his Goods for le&s;s than Prime Co&s;t, be&s;ides making u&s;e of U&s;erers and griping Extortioners, which will always Prey on him like &s;o many Vultures or Hor&s;eleach's: And the poor hone&s;t Gentleman, &s;o far from growing Rich for the Reward of his great Pains and Indu&s;try, not only &s;inks his own private Patrimony of <HI>One hundred thou&s;and Pounds,</HI> but a great many Hundreds be&s;ides. His Character is entirely ruin'd in all Parts of the Trading World, and his End may be in Ruin and Want And his Sub|&s;tance, with other hone&s;t Gentlemen's, who con&s;ign'd to him, got into the Hands of ba&s;e unworthy Knaves, who have watched all Opportunities to take Advantage of the poor Gentleman's Nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>HIS Excellency <HI>JONATHAN BELCHER,</HI> E&s;q&punc; our Governor, hath twice recommended to the General A&s;&s;embly the employing a Number of Men to take an exact Survey of this Province, and the Extent of its Bounds. For this Province is hardly known by our Mother Country. And I can with humble Mode&s;ty ob&s;erve, that the State of this Province was never yet fairly &s;tated.</P>
<P>OUR Mother Country never was &s;o full of Men and Money <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce the glorious Hou&s;e of HANOVER came to reign over us.

<P>I had almo&s;t forgot to mention one more great Benefit to this great Town of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> in the building the&s;e Mills, which all Mankind mu&s;t allow to be ju&s;t; that is thus, Suppo&s;e it &s;hould happen a War, by having &s;uch a fine Communication with the Ca&s;tle, we might &s;oon &s;upply that Fortre&s;s with Ten Thou&s;and brave Fellows that would face any Enemy on the whole Earth.

The Empire con&s;i&s;ts of fifteen &s;everal Kingdoms, which are govern'd by Vice-Roys, who yet live in Greatne&s;s, Splendor and Riches, equal to great and &s;overeign Kings. In the whole Kingdom there are 145 Capital Cities, of mighty Extent and magnificent Buildings; and 1321 le&s;&s;er Cities, but all walled round; the Number of Villages is infinite: And no Country in the known World is &s;o full of Inhabitants, nor &s;o improved by Agriculture and Manufacturies, by infinite Growth of numerous Commodies, by Canals of incredible Length, Conjunction of Rivers, by Convenience of Ways for the Tran&s;portation of all Sorts of Goods from one Province to another; &s;o as no Country has &s;o great a Trade.</P>

CYPRIAN SOUTHACK made me a Pre&s;ent of the <HI>New-England Coa&s;ting Pil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t.</HI> And as I am informed, the Motive that induced him to make me this Pre&s;ent, was his hearing that I was drawing the pre&s;ent State of the Province; he was willing to for|ward &s;uch an Undertaking as much as lay in his Power. As it is allowed by all Man|kind, that Ingratitude is as bad a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Sin of Witchcraft, therefore I think it my Duty to return Capt. SOUTHACK my mo&s;t hearty Thanks for the Pre&s;ent of his <HI>New-England Coa&s;ting Pilot,</HI> in this publick Manner.

Labour and Pains in &s;erving this mo&s;t noble Province. Mankind nothing more imitates almighty God, than by rewarding tho&s;e that lay out their Powers and Faculties in &s;er|ving Mankind, This <HI>Coa&s;ting Pilot</HI> gives me a ju&s;t Idea of the Coa&s;t of his Maje&s;ty's Provinces from <HI>New-York</HI> to the Bay of <HI>Funday.</HI> The very I&s;lands are able to contain Millions of People; which ab&s;olutely de&s;troys that vile &s;elfi&s;h Principle of &s;ome People which &s;ay they are not for Strangers coming among&s;t them, becau&s;e they &s;hall not have Land enough for their Children; which is really a childi&s;h Story.</P>
<P>UPON moderate Computation the Gentlemen Farmers have borrowed on Bond and Mortgages upwards of <HI>Five hundred thou&s;and Pounds</HI>; of which the greate&s;t Part is let at 10 <HI>per Cent.</HI> And according to the pre&s;ent Scituation of Affairs, it is impo&s;&s;ible for tho&s;e Gentlemen to pay off their Securities: So that a Gentleman that has Mortgaged his Form for 500 <HI>l.</HI> that is worth 2000, his Farm on Pro&s;ecution is certainly forfeited for want of the 500 <HI>l.</HI> And its impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e whil&s;t the griping U&s;urers Monopolizes into their own Coffers, the Bulk of that &s;mall Quantity of running Specie that is now Extant among&s;t us. And as the old &s;aying is, The ju&s;t Value of any Commodity whatever, is what it will fetch. The only Remedy to avoid this great Evil, is for the A&s;&s;embly of this Province, as I ob&s;erved before, to lay ju&s;t Schemes, to per&s;wade and allure our young Nobility, Gentry and Farmers to come and &s;ettle among us&punc;, and it's not to be doubted, but the&s;e Gentlemen would purcha&s;e the Farms of tho&s;e Gentlemen that have involved them&s;elves, and are now in a State of Bondage; and they may put Money &s;ufficient in their Pockets to proceed on the Settlement of new Farms on the out Lands, with Re&s;olution and Vigour. And in a few Years, by com|mon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ndu&s;try, they will have as good Farms as they at fir&s;t parted with, and an entire Freedom from the grand Oppre&s;&s;ion they then labour'd under. And upon the Arri|val of a Number of our young Nobility and Farmers, with a Quantity of Money, it would make it a Year of Jubilee for all tho&s;e Gentlemen that now labour under the pre&s;ent grand Oppre&s;&s;ions. For all Gentlemen well knows what a va&s;t Number of Farms mu&s;t be put to Sale in few Years&punc; And no Purcha&s;ers can appear to buy of the&s;e Country People The Rea&s;on is, becau&s;e they will not have Money to pay for them. And further, I ob&s;erve to the Gentlemen Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pkeepers not to purcha&s;e large Quantities of Engli&s;h Goods, for &s;ome time, till the Ballance of Trade is brought to a more fix Standard, for it may be mathematically proved, that as certain as any Man buys large Quantities of Goods, &s;o certain he will be ruined: For as &s;ome Gentlemen have lately got E&s;tates by the prodigious Ri&s;e of Goods, &s;o certainly &s;ome Men will be ruined by their great Fall&punc; which will come to pa&s;s, as &s;ure as the Sun that moves.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, by way of Comfort, to the Gentlemen that labour at pre&s;ent un|der great Oppre&s;&s;ions, that we have a common &s;aying. <HI>A de&s;perate Di&s;ea&s;e mu&s;t have a de&s;perate Cure</HI>; but if more pacifick Mea&s;ures can be found out, it will be va&s;tly more plea&s;ing to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Body Politick.
