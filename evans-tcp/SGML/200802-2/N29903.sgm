<HEAD>SEVERAL ARGUMENTS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IF Inoculating the Small Pox be not contained in the Laws of Phy&s;ick, then it is not lawful.</HI> But, <HI>Ino|culating the Small Pox is not contained in the Laws of Phy&s;ick.</HI> Therefore, <HI>It is unlawful.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall in the fir&s;t Place prove, that it is not contained in Natural Phy&s;ick. 2<HI>dly,</HI> I &s;hall con&s;ider it with re&s;pect to Divinity.</P>
<P N="1">1. With Re&s;pect to Natural Phy&s;ick.</P>
<P>Arg. 1. <HI>If Inoculating the Small Pox be not contained in the Rules of Natural Phy&s;ick, then it is not lawful.</HI> But, <HI>Inoculating the Small Pox is not contained in the Rules of Natural Phy&s;ick.</HI> Therefore, <HI>It is unlawful.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall prove it thus: The Rules of Natural Phy&s;ick are <HI>Two,</HI> and no more; which are <HI>Sympathy</HI> and <HI>Anti|pathy;</HI> and what&s;oever is not reducible unto one of the&s;e, is not contained in the Rules of Natural Phy|&s;ick.</P>
<P>Now Inoculating the Small Pox is not a <HI>Sympathy</HI> with, nor <HI>Antipathy</HI> unto a Wound or Di&s;ea&s;e already received, but a making a Wound, in order to commu|nicate a Di&s;ea&s;e, which is an Abu&s;e unto that Text, Math. 9. 12. <HI>They that are whole need not a Phy&s;ician&punc; but they that are &s;ick,</HI> and a horrid Violation of the In|tent that our Lord &s;aid it for.</P>
<P N="2">2. I &s;hall now proceed to prove the &s;econd Part of the Argument, That Inoculating the Small Pox is not con|tained in the Law of Phy&s;ick, as it is con&s;ider'd with re|&s;pect to Divinity.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="039757_0004_1015C14C2D651BE8">
In Deut. 39. 15. we have the&s;e Words, <HI>I kill, and I make alive, I wound, and I heal.</HI> And now in what Sen&s;e are Actions &s;aid to be God's. Actions are either to be con&s;ider'd good or evil. As they are to be con&s;ider'd good, God doth will them, and by his Power effect them. As they are con&s;ider'd evil, he permits them to be, as he did Satan to &s;mite <HI>Job</HI> with Boils.</P>
<P>We &s;hall con&s;ider in what Re&s;pect Actions are &s;aid to be good, as they are our Actions. They are &s;o when they are God-like, which was the State that God crea|ted Man in, which was in Knowledge, Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and true Holine&s;s. Our Actions mu&s;t be in Knowledge of the Will of God, or they cannot be good Actions; and Knowledge of his Will is taught by the Will of God: <HI>To the Law and to the Te&s;timony.</HI> Joh. 5. 39. <HI>They are they that te&s;tify of me</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> that declare my Will.)</P>
<P>Arg. 2 <HI>If there is no Rule in the Word of God to found Inoculation upon, then it is not according to his Will nor can it be according to Knowledge.</HI> But, <HI>There is no Rule in the Word of God to found Inoculation upon.</HI> Therefore, <HI>Inoculation cannot be according to the Will of God, nor ac|cording to Knowledge.</HI></P>
<P>Now we read in Deut. 27. 19. <HI>Cur&s;ed is he that per|verteth the Judgment</HI> (or Right) <HI>of the Stranger, Father|le&s;s and Widow.</HI></P>
<P>Arg. 3 <HI>If Inoculation has a natural Tendency to the perverting the Right of the Stranger, Fatherle&s;s and Wi|dow, then it is an unrighteous Action.</HI> But, <HI>Inoculation has a natural Tendency to the perverting the Right of the Fatherle&s;s and Widow.</HI> Therefore, <HI>It is an unrigh|teous Action.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Arg.</HI> 4 <HI>If Inoculation be a doing Violence unto the Law of Nature, and the Pattern that God hath &s;et us, then it is unholy.</HI> But, <HI>Inoculation is a doing Violence unto the Law of Nature, and the Pattern which God hath &s;et us, (which we are to imitate.)</HI> Therefore, <HI>Inoculation is unholy.</HI> Zeph. 3. 5. <HI>The ju&s;t Lord is in the mid&s;t of thee, be will do no Iniquity.</HI></P>
<P>Now, that Inoculation is unrighteous and unholy&punc; I &s;hall demon&s;trate thus: Every Man has a natural Right to
<PB N="3" REF="039757_0005_1015C14DC24B8A28">
&s;ome things in common with all Men, as being of one Blood, made and pre&s;eved by one God, coming from one Root, even <HI>Adam;</HI> a Right in common to the Bene|fit of the Sun, Moon and Stars, a &s;erene and clear Air; yea, to the cloudy Weather and Rain, to the Summer and Winter; and (we us'd to &s;ay,) to Six Foot of Land, and to his own Hou&s;e; for Man was not made to be by him|&s;elf, nor for him&s;elf, but to be in a &s;ocial Relation one to another, and &s;o &s;erve God in this Relation. 'Tis a common Saying, <HI>A Man may do with his own as he plea&s;es;</HI> but 'tis as fal&s;e as 'tis common; he may not burn his own Hou&s;e if it hazards the Con&s;uming his Neigh|bour's; neither by this Rule may they do what is right in their own Eyes in their own Hou&s;e: Jam. 2. 12, 13. <HI>So &s;peak ye, and &s;o do, as they that &s;hall be judged by the perfect Law of Liberty; for he &s;hall have Judgment with|out Mercy, that hath &s;hewed no Mercy.</HI></P>
<P>Now, to have the Small Pox brought to a Man by a voluntary Act of his Neighbour, by which he de|clares, that he does not indeavour to pre&s;erve the health and life of his Neighbour, but eventually to bereave him of both doth Violence unto the Law of Nature, and the Pattern which God hath &s;et us, which we ought to walk by. <HI>Be ye holy, for I the Lord your God am ho|ly.</HI> P&s;al. 89. 74. <HI>Justice and Judgment are the Habitation of thy Throne, Mercy and Truth &s;hall go before thy Face.</HI></P>
<P>Now we &s;ay, by Inoculation, the Small Pox hath been carried and &s;pread almo&s;t if not quite over this Town; and our Neighbours have not done as they would have others do to them. 'Tis evident they would not have it brought to them, or el&s;e why do they fly unto Inoculation. Now to have it brought to them by a voluntary Motion of their Neighbour, is more hard to be born by their injured Neighbour, than if it came to them in or by the common way; (the Pro|vidence of God ca&s;ting it where and when he will) which hath made great Heats, Divi&s;ions and Animo|&s;ities.</P>
<P>They are guilty of the Breach of the Moral and the Evangelical Law of God; for they have not done by
<PB N="4" REF="039757_0006_1015C1507577CA38">
their Neighbour as they would that their Neighbour &s;hould do to them, and that in a Ca&s;e of great Moment; not only to the hazard of Life, but the Lo&s;s of many a Life; how many God knows. Math. 7. 12. <HI>Therefore all things what&s;oever ye would that Men &s;hould do to you, do ye even &s;o to them; for this is the Law and the Prophets.</HI></P>
<P>If we are commanded to love our Neighbour as our &s;elves, then they that voluntarily bring in the Small Pox into their Hou&s;es, and not only endanger their Neigh|bours Health and Life, but eventually take both away, do <HI>tran&s;gre&s;s the Law and the Prophets,</HI> Matt. 22, 35, 36, 27, 38, 39, 40. And, Oh! What a Fountain of Blood are the Promoters guilty of! God grant them repentance unto life. May it not be &s;aid of you, <HI>You lay a&s;ide the Commandments&punc; God, and ye have learned the Traditions of Men.</HI> Mark. 7. 9. <HI>And he &s;aid unto them, Fulwell ye reject the Commandment of God, that ye may keep your own Tradition.</HI></P>
<P>A Ca&s;e may be &s;o circum&s;tanced, that may make it im|moral. I &s;hall demon&s;trate it to you thus: A Man in the Country, living far from Neighbours, may have a great Stump of a Tree in his Land, which he may de&s;ire to have out of the Way, and he may put Fire unto it, and burn it down, and do no Body any harm; And I &s;ee no rea&s;on the Authority has to call him to an Account for it; but &s;hould he for the &s;ame Rea&s;on do the &s;ame thing for kind in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and not only endanger his Neighbours Hou&s;es but eventually con&s;ume them, Will not this be looked upon Immoral, and ought not the Authority to call him to an Account for it? And what faith the Law of God? Exod. 21. <HI>Life for Life, and Eye for Eye, Tooth for Tooth, and Burning for Burning; Wound for Wound, Stripe for Stripe.</HI> And &s;eeing this way of Inoculation cannot be carried on without ha|zarding the Life and Health of People, how does it become our noble Towns-Men to take Care in this Mat|ter, if there was no other rea&s;on to be given.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 1. Whether, the Small Pox be not one of the &s;trange works of God; and whether Inoculation of it be not a fighting with the mo&s;t High, and a vying with
<PB N="5" REF="039757_0007_1015C152D4619720">
the holy One of I&s;rael? <HI>He hath &s;poken, and it &s;tandeth fa&s;t, he is of one mind, and who can turn him?</HI> And whe|ther Inoculation hath not a &s;imilitude unto, and an Affi|nity with <HI>Phaorah's</HI> Magicians who did Wonders with their Rods, even to hardning of their Hearts, that God might bring greater Judgments upon them till he had con&s;umed them, and not a mitigating of his &s;troke.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 2. Whether the Small Pox be not a Puni&s;hment from a righteous God, upon a People for their Sins? And hath it not a crying voice to them, &s;aying, <HI>Cea&s;e to do evil, and learn to do good?</HI> And whether the labouring to avert the Stroke in the way of Inoculation, doth an&s;wer this crying Voice; or whether it be not to provoke him more and more?</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> 3. Whether Inoculation be not an intrench|ment upon the Incommunicable Attributes of God, and al&s;o upon his Works, <HI>Ho&s;ea</HI> 6. 1. <HI>He hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath &s;mitten, and he will bind us up?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 4. Whether the great mortality that hath been among us in the&s;e two la&s;t Months, hath flow'd from this Inoculation? I an&s;wer, I do believe it hath, &amp; that for the following Rea&s;ons.</P>
<P><HI>Rea&s;on</HI> 1. Becau&s;e in the hot Weather, even in the Dog days there was few died, when Inoculation was lit|tle in u&s;e; but &s;ince Inoculation hath been much in u&s;e the Weather hath been more temperate, neither hot nor cold, (which I know is be&s;t for that Di&s;temper) yet the mortality hath much increa&s;ed, &s;o that there hath been no compari&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>Rea&s;on</HI> 2. From the different nature of its working it mu&s;t needs have a different malignity: The &s;mall Pox when it comes in the good old way, is ripened by a gra|dual motion; and &s;o when its nature is &s;pent, dries away gradually; As it grows gradually, it dies gradually; and if it breaks, it is as it were but a dead Wound: But the wound or inci&s;ion is a living wound, and therefore the matter or putrifaction which comes out of this wound, mu&s;t be more quick and penetrating than the other. Now the Rea&s;on they render, why there is le&s;s Pu&s;tules, and le&s;s Sickne&s;s, is, becau&s;e the malignity or venom
<PB N="6" REF="039757_0008_1015C154648FF858">
which is in the Blood, is di&s;charged by this running Wound. (though they are not always true Prophets; for I have &s;een &s;everal in their Way, that have had as many Pu&s;tules, and as much Sickne&s;s, and as many bli&s;|ters, and Kidneys to check the Fever, as in the good old Way; &amp; many in the old way who had as few Pu&s;tules as any of them, even had not their Cloaths off one Hour, &s;ome at play and others at work.)</P>
<P>Again, there is living Te&s;timony that do &s;ay, the &s;mell of this living Wound upon &s;ome Per&s;ons, is wor&s;e than ever they &s;melled it el&s;ewhere, and I cannot but believe it; for Rea&s;on tells me, that it's more raw and contrary unto Nature, and Penetrating on the Organs of the Body of Man, than the other matter, which is dead as it were.</P>
<P><HI>Rea&s;on</HI> 3. Is drawn from the fatal event that Inocula|tion hath had on tho&s;e that have took the Small Pox of them: Where are they? how few are there of tho&s;e li|ving, that we have rea&s;on to think took the Infection of them?</P>
<P>Now to &s;ave Life, by giving Death for it, it is but a &s;wapping, and very dear, though the purcha&s;er may think he hath a good bargain.</P>
<P><HI>Rea&s;on</HI> 4. Why there is &s;uch mortality of late, is, as I humbly conceive, from Inoculation. I have proved that Inoculation is not contained in the law of Phy&s;ick, whether we con&s;ider it natural or Divine; and to allude unto <HI>Jer.</HI> 7. 31. <HI>Ye have done the thing which I command|ed you not, neither did it enter into my heart.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rea&s;on</HI> 5. Becau&s;e this Inoculation is among&s;t or by a People that are called by God's Name; to allude unto <HI>Amos</HI> 3. 2. <HI>You only have I known amongst all the Families of the Earth, therefore will I puni&s;h you for all your Ini|quities.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Rea&s;on</HI> 6. Becau&s;e God is a Jealous God; Deut. 32, 22 <HI>They have provoked me to Anger with their Vanities, and I will move them to Jealou&s;y.</HI> That is, as we walk contra|ry to God, &s;o God walks contrary to us.</P>
<P><HI>In that this People is oppre&s;&s;ed and broken in Judgment, and Gods Judgments are as the light that goeth forth;</HI> the
<PB N="7" REF="039757_0009_1015C1582DF5A7D0">
Small Pox, which flyeth by night, which de&s;troyeth Men not a few, Deut. 28. <HI>The Lord doth &s;mite them with a Fever, with an Inflamation, and with Spots which cannot be healed; and</HI> as to very many <HI>the Phy&s;icians be of no value.</HI> And to allude unto <HI>Amos</HI> 4. 2.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude with Amos 5. 14. 15. <HI>Seek good and not evil, that ye may live; and &s;o the Lord, the God of Ho&s;ts, &s;hall be with you as he hath &s;poken.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hate the evil, and love the good, and e&s;tabli&s;h Judgment in the Gate, it may be the Lord the God of Ho&s;ts will be gracious unto the remnant of Jo&s;eph.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ANSWER to a Piece, Intituled, Several Rea&s;ons, proving, that Inoculating or Tran&s;planting the Small Pox, is a lawful Practice, and that it hath been ble&s;&s;ed by God for the &s;aving of many a Life. By Increa&s;e Mather. D. D.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Honoured SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Practice of <HI>Smyrna</HI> and <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> is not a Rule either of Faith or Manners, and therefore I &s;hall di&s;mi&s;s that Parapraph, and pa&s;s on to your next.</P>
<P>II. You &s;ay, <HI>We bear that &s;everal Phy&s;icians have re|commended Inoculation to his Majesty, as a Means to &s;ave the Lives of his Subjects.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> The Que&s;tion is not, Whether it may &s;ave their Lives or not, but rather, as you affirm, whether it may be lawful; which you mu&s;t prove, or you do not what you have undertaken to do. The matter was not di&s;puted by the Phari&s;ees, whether their Children did ca&s;t out Devils by <HI>Beelzebub;</HI> the Reflection that our Lord ca&s;t upon them was, that they did it <HI>unlawfully. The King and the Prince have accepted of it as a Means to &s;ave the Lives of the Subject:</HI> But yet I remember, they have not proved what you have undertaken to do, to
<PB N="6" REF="039757_0010_1015C15A6D68DCD8">
prove it lawful; neither was the Que&s;tion propos'd to them.</P>
<P>Again, You &s;ay, <HI>If wi&s;e and learned Men from</HI> En|gland, <HI>declare their Approbation of this Practice; for us to declare our Di&s;approbation, will not be for our Honour.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> All that I &s;hall &s;ay at pre&s;ent is, If wi&s;e and learned Men from <HI>England</HI> &s;hould declare their Appro|bation of wor&s;hiping God in the Epi&s;copal Way, with all the Ceremonies thereof, (which is a matter of Faith as well as this) for us to declare our Di&s;approbation will not be for our Honour. I chu&s;e at pre&s;ent to &s;et Honour again&s;t Honour, that being view'd a while, and brought home, they may &s;ee each others Similitude.</P>
<P>III. You &s;ay, <HI>God hath graciou&s;ly owned it, and ma|ny Scores have lived and recovered, and not one died, except Mrs. D&mdash;l&punc; but &s;he had the Small Pox in the common Way before,</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> I believe you cannot know that; for her Hu&s;|band told me &s;he was inoculated, and that it came forth at the Time appointed: Now you may take Notice, that Mr. <HI>D&mdash;l</HI> and I had &s;ome Talk before. Mr. <HI>D&mdash;l</HI> had &s;aid to me, that he thought it a good Pro|vidence, the Di&s;covery of this Inoculation. I an&s;wer|ed him, I believe rather that it is a terrible Delu&s;ion. I &s;aid, You know my Mind, and I know yours; now is not a time for us to talk of it: I will &s;ee her and you, as Mrs. <HI>D&mdash;l</HI> and Mr. <HI>D&mdash;l,</HI> and not as People that love Inoculation; and he &s;aid, So do. Accordingly I went. At fir&s;t the Pock looked likely; but it grew on to be very bad, and &s;he was brought exceeding low, but afterwards there was hope of her recovery, and &s;he was taken out of Bed once or twice, I cannot tell which. In the mean time two of her Children had it unknown to her a little before, &s;o lightly vi&s;ited, that I think one was not abed one hour; and I heard &s;ay in the Hou&s;e, they kept the other abed becau&s;e he &s;hould not run in to di&s;turb his mother: And the Children being brought in to her, &s;he received them with &s;urpri&s;ing Joy, and &s;oon fell into a Fit. We know &s;he was a thoughtful Woman, and the neighbours &s;aid, &s;he could not bear the reflecti|on,
<PB N="9" REF="039757_0011_1015C15FB97797F8">
how lightly they had it in the common Way, and how bad &s;he was in the new way. Had it not been a time of great trouble with Mr. <HI>D&mdash;l,</HI> I &s;hould have had more di&s;cour&s;e with him about it, but had not. I &s;ympathi&s;ed with him, and do believe that his lo&s;s is her gain. This is a true relation of that matter.</P>
<P>But I pa&s;s on to con&s;ider &s;ome of your other Rea&s;ons. You &s;ay, <HI>That the known Children of the Wicked one are generally against Inoculation, which is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> you a weighty Con&s;ideration.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reply.</HI> Wicked men have moral light as well as be|lievers. I have heard you quote heathens to have Excel|lent morals. 2. They have the light of the Go&s;pel, which they may and do under&s;tand with re&s;pect to the letter of it, and cannot &s;ee grounds for Inoculation, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. 2. 14. <HI>For when the Gentiles which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law; tho&s;e having not the Law, are a law unto them&s;elves. v. 15. which &s;how the work of the law written in their hearts; their Con&s;cience <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o bearing witne&s;s, and their thoughts the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> while ac|cu&s;ing or excu&s;ing one another.</HI></P>

<P>Your Argument is, <HI>A mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful and allowable Me|thod of preventing Death, and many other grievous Mi|&s;eries, by the Small Pox, is not only lawful but a Duty, to be u&s;ed by tho&s;e who apprehend their Lives indangered by the terrible Di&s;temper.</HI> But, <HI>The managing and govern|ing the Small Pox, in the way of Inoculation, is a mo&s;t &s;uc|ce&s;sful and allowable Method of preventing Death, and many other grievous Mi&s;eries by this dreadful Di&s;t&ecirc;mper.</HI> Therefore, <HI>it is not only lawful, but al&s;o a Duty to make u&s;e of it.</HI></P>
<P>Sir, You tell me, None but very fooli&s;h and very wicked People will deny the Propo&s;ition. How can you tell that? Are you only capable to tell a Man what he mu&s;t not do&punc; and if he doth that which you think not good, mu&s;t you enter into Judgment, and pro|nounce him <HI>very fooli&s;h and very wicked.</HI></P>
<P>Sir, Whatever you think of your Propo&s;ition, I think it a poor and a beggarly thing, to take that for grant|ed which is denyed, to put into your Propo&s;ition.</P>
<P>I &s;hall fir&s;t tell you, that the Word <HI>Allowable</HI> is am|biguous, and &s;hall di&s;tingui&s;h and enquire what you mean by it: If you mean <HI>humane Authority,</HI> I &s;hall take no Notice of it. <HI>To the&punc; law and to the Testimony, and if they &s;peak not according unto that, it is becau&s;e there is no Light in them.</HI> But if you mean an allowable Way by the Law of Phy&s;ick, then I deny your <HI>Propo&s;ition.</HI> And now let us &s;ee who is the Fool. Your Propo&s;ition is, <HI>That it is a most &s;ucce&s;sful and allowable Method of pre|venting Death.</HI> Now we fear there are many in the Grave the More for it; therefore we cannot believe that it is a &s;ucce&s;sful Way of preventing Death.</P>
<P>And now I deny the Con&s;equence of your Minor Pro|po&s;ition, and &s;ay, that cannot be accounted a &s;afe way, which hath an evil Tendency, and a bad end, (eventu|ally

It was good that Satan &s;hould be di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his Habitation which he had taken up in Men in our Lord's Day; but it was not lawful that the Children of the Phari&s;ees &s;hould ca&s;t them out by&punc; the help of <HI>Beelzebub:</HI> We mu&s;t always have an Eye to the Matter of what we do as well as to the Re&s;ult, if we in|tend

<P>From the Means and End of effecting the Action, it is well or ill di&s;po&s;ed. 'Tis a Duty to go to hear God's Word preached, but 'tis unlawful to &s;teal a Hor&s;e to ride to hear it.

Again, you &s;ay, <HI>Suppo&s;e here was a mortal Sickne&s;s in the Town, as the Bloody-Flux, and a Phy&s;ician is Ma&s;ter of a Purge, which who&s;oever takes, is in an ordinary Way&punc; delivered from the Danger of that Di&s;temper.

<P>Your Argument is drawn from an Artificial Purge to &s;top a Natural Purge, which no body denys; but this is foreign to the Ca&s;e in Hand.</P>
<P>But you &s;hould have &s;aid, (if you had &s;poke to the purpo&s;e,) &s;uppo&s;e the bloody Flux prevail in the Town where I live, and a Phy&s;ician goes to one of their hou&s;es, and takes a Bottle of that fluxical bloody Excrement, &amp; put it into a Man, (by a Cly&s;ter Pipe or any way el&s;e,) and gives him he Bloody-Flux, which who&s;oever takes, is delivered in an ordinary Way from the danger of that Di&s;temper.

<HI>Reply.</HI> Sir, we are deterred from that for &s;everal Rea|&s;ons. 1. We know that the able&s;t Mini&s;ters in the Country are but men, and are failable as well as our|&s;elves. 2. They bring not their Arguments from &s;crip|ture, but from the Hi&s;tory of Places where it was practi|ced, and plead the lawfulne&s;s of it from the event, which we believe is no &s;afe way for Chri&s;tians to argue; and if it &s;hould be allowed of, I could give in&s;tances enough to fill your ears, Ho&s;. 7. 11. <HI>Ephraim is like a &s;illy dove without heart; they call to Egypt, they go to A&s;&s;yria</HI> (to help them to Arguments.) 3. Becau&s;e God's Judgments was threatned again&s;t I&s;rael for learning of the manners of the Heathen, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 11. 12. <HI>(which I cast forth before you.)</HI> 4. Becau&s;e the Mini&s;ters are very generally re|volted from the good old way, and have &s;et up a way that their Fathers knew not of, neither entered it into their Hearts; to allude unto Jer. 5. 23. <HI>They are revol|ted and gone.</HI> 5. It's very natural for men not to be &s;en|&s;ible of their own weakne&s;s of judgment; from hence it is (as I &s;uppo&s;e) men have &s;o great an Opinion of their own Works, although there is no Beauty nor comeline&s;s in them: from hence ari&s;es a de&s;ire to impo&s;e. And others think they know as much about Inoculati|on as they de&s;ire, and they think the Scripture is &s;ilent, in this matter, the rather, becau&s;e that is the Key which you mu&s;t unlock Ca&s;es of Con&s;cience by.</P>
<P>Again, They &s;ay you have no Scripture for it, for if you had, you would have told us &s;o, and directed us where to find it; but you have not done either, there|fore you have none:</P>
<P>Therefore they could expect no advice from you; for you have no Arguments but &s;uch as you fetch out of Hi&s;tory, and we de&s;ire to learn none of their manners.</P>
<P>They daily &s;ee what Work Men make when they in|termeddle with any thing they do not under&s;tand, or was not prentice to. Suppo&s;e a Taylor &s;hould go into a Cobler's Shop to work; his Tools are not fit, neither hath he skill to u&s;e the Coblers tools, and &s;o he makes but cobling work; and then his ware lies upon hand, and he derided and &s;coffed at, and that for his work;
<PB N="15" REF="039757_0017_1015C16FB85D8CD8">
when it is po&s;&s;ible the man is proper and comely, and of a good genius, when imployed in what he under&s;tands. Hence it was that the Serene States of <HI>Holland</HI> made a Law to prevent Mini&s;ters medling with State Affairs, becau&s;e their Work was not Temporal but Divine, and the inter|mixing of them not &s;afe for the common wealth. The Law was, That if a Mini&s;ter intermeddled to dictate Peo|ple about State affairs, the Government was to provide him a pair of new Shoes and a Staff, and lead him to the out&s;ide of the Town, and let him return to his pulpit no more. So for Mini&s;ters to be able to an&s;wer this natural que&s;tion, we think is too hard for them; for we think that every thing is beautiful in its &s;ea&s;on, or to that which it is adapted to. Now Mini&s;ters work is divine, and for that they are paid for, and for any thing el&s;e they are not thanked for, nor indeed (&s;ay &s;ome) are not for any thing el&s;e thank worthy.</P>
<P>In the next Place, I &s;hall take no notice of your Con|clu&s;ion which will be victorious you &s;ay, (but I think it is again&s;t your &s;elf) <HI>That when People have their lives indangered by the Small Pox hovering about them, they may not only u&s;e the method of Inoculation to &s;ave their lives, but they even ought to do it, if they can: they keep not in good Terms with the &s;ixth Commandment if they do it not.</HI></P>

But Sir, here &s;eems to want more Gram|mar Learning, or more hone&s;ty, I cannot divine which. You brought in the&s;e words into your Conclu&s;ion which was not in your Major nor Minor, <HI>They keep not in good Terms with the &s;ixth Commandment if they do it not.</HI> Sir, I tell you your Argument is lame; its feet are not equal, and pray take it home again, and inoculate or graft on three pieces more to your &s;ophi&s;tical Argument, or el&s;e it will not be able to &s;tand, and mu&s;t fall to the Ground unavoidably.

I have known Children that have had the King's Evil, and have de&s;ired their Governours to let them go and be touched by the King, who lays his Hand upon them and &s;ays, I touch, and God heals: Whether or no if Parents or Governours are &s;atisfy'd that it is not law|ful, or that there is no Phy&s;ical Means in it, they ought not to deter them from it, le&s;t the Di&s;ea&s;e may not go off, and they have &s;ad Cau&s;e of Reflection.

<P>Now I hope the Reader may &s;ee what our Gentleman aim'd at, when he put forth his Hand, as the Effect of a covetous Mind, and &s;tole the&s;e Words into the Con|clu&s;ion, which were not in the Major, to wit, they keep not in good Terms with the Sixth Commandment if they do it not. And now I &s;uppo&s;e, from the Com|mandment he infers, that God hath made Inoculation a Duty. The Syphi&s;try of this lies here: His Argument &s;hould have run thus:</P>
<P>What God hath made a Duty, and a mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful and allowable Method of preventing Mi&s;eries by the Small Pox, ought to be practis'd. <HI>But,</HI> God hath made it a Duty. <HI>Therefore,</HI> it ought to be practi&s;ed.</P>
<P>Now, had he put into his Major propo&s;ition, <HI>What God hath made a Duty,</HI> we might have come at his Minor Propo&s;ition, which mu&s;t have run thus, <HI>But God hath made it a mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful and allowable way to pre|vent Death by the Small Pox.</HI> Then his Conclu&s;ion might hove run thus, <HI>Therefore it ought to be practi&s;ed.</HI> And we might have come at his Minor by denying it; and till he had proved it, his Conclu&s;ion would have &s;tood tottering, but if he had proved his Minor, his Con|clu&s;ion would &s;tand good: But how he would have proved it, I cannot tell, except he made a Trip to <HI>Smyr|na</HI> and <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and to many wi&s;e and learned Men.</P>
<P>Again, you &s;ay, <HI>To call this</HI> a Work of the Devil, &amp;c. <HI>is a &s;hocking Bla&s;phemy.</HI> Pray who told you &s;o?
