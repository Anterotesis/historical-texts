<HEAD>A DISCOURSE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY HEARERS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS day completes &s;ixty-eight years &s;ince the birth of the illu&s;trious <HI>GEORGE WASHINGTON,</HI> formerly leader of the American people, in their &s;truggle for inde|pendence; twice &s;ucce&s;&s;ively Pre&s;ident of the United States of America; and late Lieutenant-General and Commander in Chief of their armies. For many years the anniver&s;ary of his birth has been ob&s;erved as a day of fe&s;tivity. Its return was wont to infu&s;e into the people of America pe|culiarly plea&s;ing emotions. They welcomed it as the natal day of one whom they highly e&s;teemed for his talents and virtues; to whom they felt grateful for his beneficial labors on their behalf; and to whom they &s;till looked as a coun|&s;ellor for advice, and as an experienced leader to guide their armies if di&s;turbed by dome&s;tic, or invaded by foreign enemies. But alas! the &s;cene is changed; their hopes are bla&s;ted. The FRIEND, the FATHER, the political DELIV|ERER of his country no longer lives! Having accompli&s;hed the purpo&s;es for which he was de&s;igned in the coun&s;els of Heaven, the &s;overeign di&s;po&s;er of all events has called him from life; he now &s;leeps with his fathers in the peaceful tomb. And tho&s;e fe&s;tive &s;ongs with which this day has been accu&s;tomed to be celebrated mu&s;t give place to mourn|ful &s;trains. "The joy of our heart is cea&s;ed; our dance is turned into mourning. For this our heart is &s;aint; for this our eyes are dim."</P>
<P>IN compliance with the recommendation of our na|tional Legi&s;lature, communicated in a proclamation from
<PB N="6" REF="037430_0004_100D41B967731F00">
our re&s;pected Chief Magi&s;trate, we have now a&s;&s;embled in the &s;anctuary of the Lord, not to hail the birth day of the Man we loved, with &s;ongs of joy, but in accents of woe to lament his death, and to pay a tribute of re&s;pect to his memory. Called upon by my fellow-citizens, I am now to addre&s;s you on the mournful occa&s;ion. I &s;hould &s;hrink from the ta&s;k were it not for the known candor of my au|dience. I feel my&s;elf incompetent to do ju&s;tice to &s;o great a character, and unable to &s;ugge&s;t any new ideas on a &s;ubject on which my hearers have already heard and read &s;o much. Any thing new concerning the life or character of <HI>GENE|RAL WASHINGTON</HI> cannot be expected from me. With the various particulars of his life many of you are better ac|quainted than my&s;elf; and his character has been already delineated to you in a manner which I cannot expect to equal. But the portrait of a friend is not the le&s;s plea&s;ing for being often viewed. I flatter my&s;elf therefore, that you will favor me with your attention, and that your candor will excu&s;e a repetition of ideas which you may have heard before. What I propo&s;e is to notice &s;ome of the leading traits in the character of that great man for whom our na|tion this day mourns; to recommend his virtues to your imitation; and to make &s;ome religious and moral reflections on his death. My remarks will be grounded on the fol|lowing pa&s;&s;age of in&s;piration:</P>
<Q><BIBL>ISAIAH iii. 1, 2, 3.</BIBL>
BEHOLD the LORD, the LORD of Ho&s;ts, doth take away&mdash;the mighty man, and the man of war&mdash;the prudent&mdash;the honorable man, and the coun&s;ellor.</Q>
<P>WHEN, my brethren, has there appeared a char|acter to whom the epithets here u&s;ed by the Prophet might be applied with &s;o much propriety as to the
<PB N="7" REF="037430_0005_100D41BB85EADCB0">
great <HI>WASHINGTON?</HI> He was truly a <HI>mighty man,</HI> as he was endowed with an a&s;&s;emblage of talents very rarely found combined in one man;&mdash;talents which qualified him for di&s;tingui&s;hed u&s;efulne&s;s to the country that gave him birth, and which &s;ecured to him the applau&s;es of an admiring world. He was <HI>mighty</HI> in war and <HI>mighty</HI> in peace; &s;ingularly emi|nent in public and equally amiable in private life. Uniformly guided by a &s;en&s;e of duty, he &s;eems to have been free from the influence of every &s;ordid, of every mean pa&s;&s;ion, and to have been exempt from tho&s;e foibles which are often found to attend men worthy in other re&s;pects.</P>
<P>HE was a <HI>man of war.</HI> At a very early period of life, he became di&s;tingui&s;hed for his &s;kill as a military commander, and often led the forces of his native &s;tate in dangerous enterpri&s;es. On all occa|&s;ions he acquitted him&s;elf with honor and gained the applau&s;es of his country, <Q>di&s;playing uniform|ly uncommon fortitude under per&s;onal hard&s;hips, per&s;evering indu&s;try, cool and undaunted brave|ry, and the mo&s;t brilliant military talents.</Q> When the late war, which happily terminated in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the United States as a free and independent nation, commenced, all eyes were turned to the man, who had already &s;o highly &s;ig|nalized him&s;elf, as the mo&s;t &s;uitable per&s;on in the nation, to take the command of their armies. With that &s;elf-diffidence which ever accompanies true merit he accepted the command. At the call of his countrymen, indignant at their wrongs, and de&s;ir|ous
<PB N="8" REF="037430_0006_100D41BFB9E10FF8">
to free them from an oppre&s;&s;ive yoke, he re|linqui&s;hed the plea&s;ing charms of a happy retire|ment and expo&s;ed him&s;elf to &s;cenes where every thing dear to man was at &s;take. Of the manner in which he executed this important and dangerous commi&s;&s;ion, I need not &s;peak. The various events of the war, which are fre&s;h in the recollection of many of my hearers, from their having either borne an active part in them or intimately known them at the time, and which tho&s;e of us in earlier life have heared from our fathers, bear an ample te&s;timony to his intrepid bravery, &s;ingular prudence, great pre&s;ence of mind, uncommon knowledge of man|kind, and great fruitfulne&s;s in the invention of re|&s;ources to extricate him&s;elf, the army, and the country from dangerous &s;cenes. When the war terminated he di&s;played the &s;ame magnanimity which he had before manife&s;ted. In a dignified manner he re&s;igned his commi&s;&s;ion, and retired to the peace|ful walks of private life.</P>
<P>COMPARE him with ALEXANDER, JULIUS CAESAR, CHARLES of Sweden, or FREDERIC of Pru&s;&s;ia, to who&s;e names hi&s;tory has attached the epithet of great. As military commanders they were great, but they were guided either by a mad ambition to extend their conque&s;ts, by a wi&s;h to en|&s;lave their country, by a precipitate ra&s;hne&s;s, or a thir&s;t for military glory. They unreluctantly &s;ac|rificed the lives of thou&s;ands to gratify their own ambition; and though we may be dazzled with the rapidity and extent of their conque&s;ts, we mu&s;t
<PB N="9" REF="037430_0007_100D41C14891F458">
&s;hudder at the recital of the carnage, de&s;truction and mi&s;ery with which tho&s;e conque&s;ts were atten|ded; we mu&s;t de&s;pi&s;e the men for the meanne&s;s of the views by which they were actuated. Compar|ed with the&s;e how truly, how uniformly great does the HERO of America appear! Entirely free from tho&s;e &s;ordid principles which have fixed an indelible &s;tain upon their reputations, he was guided &s;olely by a regard to the public weal. He un&s;heathed his &s;word not to en&s;lave his country but to redre&s;s its wrongs, and when this object was accompli&s;hed, he returned it to its &s;cabbard, and retired to &s;hare with others the happy fruits of his toil.</P>
<P>THE <HI>prudent, the honorable man, and the coun|&s;ellor.</HI> Equally appropriate to the character of Gen|eral <HI>WASHINGTON</HI> are the&s;e epithets with tho&s;e al|ready noticed. Prudence was a very &s;triking trait in his character. He exhibited many marks of un|common di&s;cretion, through the whole cour&s;e of his life, both in the field and in the cabinet. When commanding the armies of his country, and when at the head of its civil government, he was many times placed in trying &s;ituations; he was called to pa&s;s through &s;cenes which not only would have di&s;|couraged a mind le&s;s firm and re&s;olute than his, but which required a di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate coolne&s;s, a &s;aga|cious prudence to prevent their i&s;&s;uing in the great|e&s;t evil. The manner in which he conducted in &s;uch &s;ituations evinced the &s;uperiority of his under|&s;tanding and his profound prudence. In this virtue
<PB N="10" REF="037430_0008_100D41C399276C30">
he &s;hone unrivalled, and it was owing to this that he never committed an action which, in the view of impartial po&s;terity, will tarni&s;h a reputation more &s;plendid than that of any of the &s;ons of men.</P>
<P>A CHARACTER more uniformly <HI>honorable</HI> than his hi&s;tory does not record. He was loaded with every honor which his country had to be&s;tow, and continually received marks of e&s;teem and re&s;pect from all parts of the civilized world. Of the&s;e honors he proved him&s;elf worthy by a conduct uni|formly noble, great and honorable. Free from tho&s;e blemi&s;hes which are often found to &s;tain the characters of men great in many re&s;pects, our belo|ved chieftain never was known, in public or in private life, to be guilty of an action irreconcileable with honor, dignity or propriety. In di&s;charging the du|ties of tho&s;e high &s;tations which he was called to fill, he was connected with men of every character, the ba&s;e as well as the worthy. Tho often di&s;gu&s;ted with the meanne&s;s and littlene&s;s of the former, from a becoming dignity of deportment he never depar|ted: tho attempts were often made to injuire him, by ambitious and de&s;igning men who were envious of his talents and virtues, and who wi&s;hed to de|pre&s;s him that they might exalt them&s;elves, we find him ever conducting towards them &s;o as to give them no ju&s;t occa&s;ion to impeach his honor or to reproach him of treating them unworthily. To the&s;e who know the embarra&s;&s;ments he met with from officers under his command, during the revolutionary war, to tho&s;e who are acquainted with the continual ob|&s;tacles
<PB N="11" REF="037430_0009_100D41C5542D5438">
thrown in his way, by the enemies of his ad|mini&s;tration, during his pre&s;idency, I appeal for the truth of the&s;e remarks.</P>
<P>HIS having been twice cho&s;en Pre&s;ident of the United States by the unanimous &s;uffrages of the elec|tors of every &s;tate, evinces the high opinion which his fellow-citizens entertained of him as a <HI>Coun&s;ellor,</HI> as a political ruler.&mdash;His conduct through the whole cour&s;e of his admini&s;tration &s;hows that the opinion of his countrymen was not ill-founded, that their confidence was not mi&s;-placed. When fir&s;t called to the chief magi&s;tracy, his &s;ituation was peculiar. The form of government at the head of who&s;e ad|mini&s;tration he was placed was new. He had to tread in an unbeaten path, and in many re&s;pects to e&s;tabli&s;h regulations not only for him&s;elf but for his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in office. The friends of the con&s;titution, de&s;irous of its permanent e&s;tabli&s;hment, looked to him with an anxious eye, knowing that much de|pended on the mea&s;ures which he &s;hould adopt; and equally attentive were its enemies to watch his actions hoping to find &s;omething which they might make u&s;e of as an in&s;trument for the &s;ubver&s;ion of the government. The great wi&s;dom with which he di&s;charged the duties of his high office, and the happy fruits of his admini&s;tration, a&s;toni&s;hed the world no le&s;s than the &s;plendid talents which he had exhibited as a military commander. He di&s;played the &s;ame dignified conduct, the &s;ame &s;agacious pru|dence, and the &s;ame elevation of mind which had marked his character in other &s;cenes. And when
<PB N="12" REF="037430_0010_100D41C869A7C9B0">
he declined a re-election and once more retired to private life, he gave occa&s;ion to his country and to the world at large again to admire his moderation, his freedom from an unworthy ambition, his patri|oti&s;m, his magnanimity.</P>
<P>HE was not permitted to enjoy, for any length of time, the retirement he had &s;o ardently wi&s;hed. He &s;aw his country threatened by an in&s;idious foe; and tho arrived at a time of life when he might have ju&s;tly plead an exemption from any further public &s;ervice, he con&s;ented again to put him&s;elf at the head of the American army, &s;hould that army be called to action; at the &s;ame time declining, as he had ever before done, any pecuniary reward for his &s;ervices.</P>
<P>To this view of his character I beg leave to add another trait which tended &s;till more highly to ex|alt and enoble him. I allude to his reverence for the GOD of his fathers. The &s;uperintending Prov|idence of the Mo&s;t High he ever acknowledged. To this he a&s;cribed his &s;ucce&s;&s;es, not to his own &s;kill and prowe&s;s; to this he a&s;cribed the pro&s;perity of the United States, not to the wi&s;dom and labors of their rulers. On all &s;uitable occa&s;ions he ex|pre&s;&s;ed a becoming gratitude to GOD for his kind interpo&s;itions in behalf of the army or the nation; and when defeated in any of his expectations, he devoutly acknowledged the &s;ame Providence and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively bowed to the rod.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="037430_0011_100D41CA6274A9D8">
THUS was he ever both great and good; great as a warrior;&mdash;great as a politician;&mdash;great as a private citizen; and good as a humble wor&s;hipper of GOD.</P>
<P>SOON after he received and accepted the ap|pointment of Commander in Chief of the armies of the United States, it plea&s;ed the great arbiter of life and death &s;uddenly to terminate his earthly cour&s;e. Mature in years, loaded with honors, loved by his country, applauded by the world, he fell a victim to a &s;hort di&s;ea&s;e. He beheld the ap|proach of death with calmne&s;s, and expired with|out a groan; appearing great in death as he had been in life.</P>
<P>THE memory of a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch u&s;eful and uncommon talents, and who devoted tho&s;e talents to the &s;ervice of the nation, will, I tru&s;t, ever be held dear by the people of America. His great virtues and his &s;plendid actions we &s;hall re|count to our children and they to theirs; and mil|lions yet unborn will "ri&s;e and call him ble&s;&s;ed." Every future return of this day will bring to mind <HI>the mighty man and the man of war, the prudent, the honorable man and the coun&s;ellor;</HI> and &s;o long as a re|gard for true merit, &s;o long as gratitude &s;hall exi&s;t in the human mind, the memory of <HI>WASHINGTON</HI> will be dear to the country which, under the ble&s;|&s;ing of Heaven, he rai&s;ed to empire by his &s;word, and e&s;tabli&s;hed in peaceful pro&s;perity by his coun&s;el.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="037430_0012_100D41CBF07C00A8">
BUT, my hearers, &s;imply to pronounce an eu|logy upon a departed friend is not the only way in which we ought to &s;how re&s;pect to his memory. In addition to this we &s;hould imitate his virtues and ob|&s;erve his wi&s;e coun&s;els. Suffer me therefore again to pre&s;ent to your view the friend who&s;e death we now lament, and to propo&s;e his example for im|itation.</P>
<P>FEW of us indeed &s;hall ever be called to com|mand armies or to admini&s;ter civil government. Many of his great and &s;plendid actions it will not therefore be in our power to imitate. Still we mu&s;t endeavor to be actuated by principles &s;imilar to tho&s;e which governed him, if like him we wi&s;h to leave a good name behind us.</P>
<P>WE find him ever ready to obey the calls of duty, not &s;uffering any con&s;iderations of private ea&s;e and convenience to re&s;train him. His courage was not that ra&s;hne&s;s which &s;ometimes impels men to ru&s;h upon danger wholly regardle&s;s of con&s;e|quences: It was combined with coolne&s;s&mdash;with di&s;|cretion which led him to weigh well the probable i&s;&s;ue of his conduct. Here we have an example worthy our imitation. Let a &s;en&s;e of duty be the leading principle of our actions, and animate us ever to do what, upon due deliberation, we believe to be right. Let us learn to "think on our ways," to "ponder the paths of our feet," and with in|trepidity encounter every danger to which we may be expo&s;ed in the di&s;charge of our duty. Let not
<PB N="15" REF="037430_0013_100D41CD9F567DD0">
a thir&s;t for popularity, let not a fear of incurring the cen&s;ure of the weak or the wicked ever deter us from performing the duties attached to our re&s;|pective &s;tations in life. De&s;pi&s;ing <Q>that popular|ity which is rai&s;ed without merit and lo&s;t without a crime,</Q> let us aim to &s;ecure <Q>that applau&s;e which will ever be be&s;towed on great and virtu|ous actions.</Q></P>
<P>THE patrioti&s;m and public &s;piritedne&s;s of our decea&s;ed political father were &s;hining traits in his character, which al&s;o we &s;hould &s;trive to imitate. Free from that narrowne&s;s of mind which leads many people to confine all their regards to them|&s;elves, he felt for others, he loved his country, and devoted his whole time and energetic talents to ob|jects which might benefit the nation and the world. His love to the country was real; it was not that noi&s;y &s;how of patrioti&s;m which leads many to de|claim much concerning the public good who are actuated only by a ba&s;e ambition; and who are lib|eral of their cen&s;ures of tho&s;e in office, merely from a wi&s;h to exalt them&s;elves upon the ruin of others. Often did the great patriot who&s;e death we now la|ment &s;acrifice his private ea&s;e and intere&s;t to ad|vance the public good; and he manife&s;ted that he was entirely free from a &s;elfi&s;h ambition to elevate him&s;elf and from an avaricious de&s;ire to ama&s;s wealth at the expen&s;e of the public. Let tho&s;e who boa&s;t &s;o much of their patrioti&s;m evince them|&s;elves equally free from &s;elfi&s;h views, and we will allow the ju&s;tice of their claims. My hearers, let
<PB N="16" REF="037430_0014_100D41D01BFB19E8">
all cultivate that love to our country which will ever lead us to be &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to its laws, to re&s;pect its rulers, and to aid them in the admini&s;tration of government, in&s;tead of continually throwing ob|&s;tacles in their way. And let us ever remember that good citizens will never &s;eek redre&s;s for any &s;up|po&s;ed injuries except in a legal and con&s;titutional manner.</P>
<P>WE may, in the next place, view the farmer of Mount Vernon in his private life. <Q>He was a man of the &s;tricte&s;t honor and hone&s;ty, fair and honorable in his dealings, and punctual to his engagements. His di&s;po&s;ition was mild, kind and generous. Candor, &s;incerity, moderation and &s;implicity were prominent features in his character. He was an affectionate hu&s;band, a faithful friend, a humane ma&s;ter and a father to the poor. He lived in the unvarying habits of regularity, temperance and indu&s;try.</Q></P>
<P>IT is too commonly the ca&s;e that men who dazzle the world by the &s;plendor of their public actions, who are di&s;tingui&s;hed for martial courage or political wi&s;dom, are deficient in private virtues. Tho great in public, in private they manife&s;t a want of true magnanimity, by indulging pride, oppre&s;&s;ion, inju&s;tice, anger, ill-nature and exce&s;|&s;ive gratifications. When the world at large is look|ing upon them they will try to appear great and honorable; but when viewed only by the dome&s;tic circle they appear even mean and contemptible.
<PB N="17" REF="037430_0015_100D41D24AD6EAE8">
Not &s;o the truly dignified <HI>WASHINGTON.</HI> In the peaceful walks of private life he appeared amiable, as he did great when at the head of armies, or when pre&s;iding over the government of a nation.</P>
<P>IT is in the&s;e private virtues more particularly that we &s;hould view him as an example, and en|deavor to imitate him. The&s;e virtues have more real influence on human happine&s;s than tho&s;e &s;plen|did actions which a&s;toni&s;h the world. They may not give a man &s;o high a degree of celebrity, but they yield an internal peace more truly grateful than the applau&s;es of a misjudging world. Let us then &s;edulou&s;ly cultivate and practi&s;e that hone&s;ty and genero&s;ity, that candor and &s;incerity, that mode|ration and &s;elf-government, that temperance and attention to the dome&s;tic virtues which were exem|plified in the life of the American CINCINNATUS.</P>
<P>WHILE thus attentive to all the &s;ocial virtues, he was not unmindful of the duties of religion. Tho his avocations were numerous, yet <Q>in his al|lotments for the revolving hours of the day reli|gion was not forgotten. Feeling, what he &s;o of|ten publicly acknowledged, his entire depend|ence on GOD, he daily, at &s;tated &s;ea&s;ons, retired to his clo&s;et, to wor&s;hip at his foot&s;tool, and to a&s;k his divine ble&s;&s;ing. He was remarkable for his &s;trict ob&s;ervation of the &s;abbath, and exemplary in his attendance on public wor&s;hip.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="037430_0016_100D41D41C0A5070">
WHATEVER other endowments a man may po&s;&s;e&s;s, if de&s;titute of all regard for religion,&mdash;if entirely inattentive to what he owes to GOD, he is deficient in that which gives real worth and dignity to man. Without goodne&s;s there can be no true greatne&s;s; and without religion there can be no true goodne&s;s. A becoming veneration for the character of JEHOVAH, a reverence for his word and in&s;titutions, and a &s;incere obedience to his pre|cepts, in addition to the practice of tho&s;e duties which re&s;ult from our re&s;pective &s;tations in life, are nece&s;&s;ary to complete a perfect character.&mdash;The&s;e are al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary to render us acceptable to that GOD without who&s;e approbation we mu&s;t be mi&s;e|rable however applauded by the world. To the duties of religion, as pre&s;cribed in the volume of divine revelation, let us carefully attend. Let us cheri&s;h that "fear of the LORD which is the begin|ning of wi&s;dom," and reject with abhorrence tho&s;e fal&s;e principles which teach that an individual or a nation may be great without religion. I will clo&s;e this branch of my &s;ubject with an extract from the addre&s;s of our late illu&s;trious Chief to his fellow-countrymen, when he declined a re-election to the chief magi&s;tracy.</P>
<P><Q>OF all the di&s;po&s;itions and habits which lead to political pro&s;perity, religion and morality are indi&s;pen&s;ible &s;upports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patrioti&s;m who would labor to &s;ubvert the&s;e great pillars of human happine&s;s, the&s;e firme&s;t props of the duties of men and cit|izens.

The merely politician, equally with the pious man ought to re&s;pect and to cheri&s;h them. A volume could not trace all their connections with private and public felicity. And let us with caution indulge the &s;uppo&s;ition, that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded of the influence of a refined education on minds of a peculiar &s;tructure, rea|&s;on and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclu&s;ion of re|ligious principle.</Q></P>
<P>THESE ideas, ju&s;t in them&s;elves, acquire addi|tional importance by coming from one who&s;e ex|ten&s;ive knowledge of men and things qualified him to judge of the influence of religious and moral principles.</P>
<P>THUS, my hearers, have I endeavored to pre|&s;ent to your view &s;ome outlines of a character de|&s;ervedly dear to the people of America; and to re|commend his example to your imitation, as the mo&s;t proper way of paying re&s;pect to his memory. I have not aimed to plea&s;e the imagination by the charms of novelty, or to intere&s;t the feelings by the flights of fancy. I have, in a plain manner, ex|hibited to you a character which you have long e&s;|teemed; and if what I have &s;aid &s;hall induce any to &s;eek to imitate him in his virtues, my highe&s;t am|bition will be gratified. A few reflections, by way of improvement, will clo&s;e this di&s;cour&s;e.</P>

IN the fir&s;t place, We are led from our text to acknowledge and adore the hand of GOD in the life and death of men who are di&s;tingui&s;hed for their talents, and who are made ble&s;&s;ings to a nation. "The LORD reigneth, let the earth rejoice." Whenever in the cour&s;e of his Providence, he hath any great de&s;ign to accompli&s;h he qualifies men for the purpo&s;e. And when his de&s;igns are an&s;wered <HI>he taketh way the mighty man and the man of war, the prudent, the honorable man, and the Coun&s;ellor.</HI> Some|times &s;uch men are removed at periods when their continuance in life &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary for the happine&s;s of millions. Thus does GOD teach us that vain is the help of man, and that our help &s;tandeth alone in him in whom is everla&s;ting &s;trength. Let us &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ively bow to his will, and devoutly commend our&s;elves and our country to his merciful protection.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, While we humble our&s;elves under the late frown of divine Providence, let us be tru|ly grateful to GOD for &s;o long continuing to us the important life and beneficial labors of the great and good man who has been lately taken from us. There were many periods when, to human appear|ance, his removal would have been a greater ca|lamity to this nation; nay when our very exi&s;tence as a nation &s;eemed to depend upon the pre&s;ervation of his life. He lived to conduct his country to in|dependence and empire; he lived to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the for|mation of its excellent con&s;titution, to pre&s;ide over its government for &s;everal years, and to give an ex|ample to his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in office of the manner in
<PB N="21" REF="037430_0019_100D2F27391864E0">
which the duties of that high &s;tation &s;hould be filled, to in&s;ure peace, pro&s;perity and happine&s;s to the na|tion. That he was thus long pre&s;erved to us mer|its our gratitude to him "by whom kings reign and princes decree ju&s;tice."</P>
<P>LASTLY, The mournful occa&s;ion of our pre|&s;ent meeting leads us to reflect upon the vanity of human grandeur, the vanity of all earthly things. GOD alone is truly great, becau&s;e he changeth not. Man is continually changing: "At his be&s;t e&s;tate he is altogether vanity. His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth: in that very day his thoughts peri&s;h; and wherein is he to be accounted of?" However dignified in character, however u&s;eful to others, he mu&s;t yield to the &s;ceptre of death. "No man hath power over the &s;pirit to retain the &s;pirit; neither hath he power in the day of death; and there is no di&s;charge in that war." The rich and the poor, the high and the low mu&s;t all crumble to the &s;ame undi&s;tingui&s;hed du&s;t. When the hour of death &s;hall come, all earthly grandeur will be found to be vain. It will be of no avail to have acquired the greate&s;t riches, if de&s;titute of a trea&s;ure in the heavenly world: It will be of no avail to have the honor which cometh from man if de&s;titute of that which cometh from GOD. Therefore, my brethren, let us be &s;olicitous above all things to &s;eek an intere&s;t in him who is "the re&s;urrection and the life," who died to redeem from &s;in and mi&s;ery all who &s;hall believe in him. Let us aim to &s;erve GOD and our
<PB N="22" REF="037430_0020_100D41DD05E0DE18">
generation faithfully, and "do with all our might whatever our hands &s;hall find to do," remembering that "there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wi&s;dom in the grave whither we are ha&s;ten|ing."</P>
