<OPENER><SALUTE>BRETHREN AND FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE occa&s;ion on which we are a&s;&s;embled, is both mournful and glorious. It cannot fail to excite the different and oppo&s;ite emotions of joy and &s;orrow in the brea&s;t of every true American. This day gave birth to that illu&s;trious <HI>hero, patri|ot, &s;age,</HI> who in war was our ho&s;t; in peace our father and friend&mdash;the guardian genius of our liberties civil and &s;acred; the political &s;avior of his country. This day, a WASHINGTON was born! It has long been celebrated by a grateful people, as a day peculiarly au&s;picious to our coun|try; a day, when kind Heaven, pitying the ab|ject and &s;ervile condition of our American I&s;rael, gave us a &s;econd Mo&s;es, who &s;hould, (under God) be our future deliverer from the bondage and ty|ranny of haughty Britain. As &s;uch, it ought
<PB N="6" REF="037036_0004_100C319A01F88C10">
ever to be remembered with religious gratitude and prai&s;e, to the great Ruler of nations, who &s;etteth up one and pulleth down another; who cru&s;heth the proud tyrants of the earth; and hath, in his governing Providence, rai&s;ed us to &s;uch eminence among the nations of the world.</P>
<P>But alas! how changed the &s;cene! Columbia's boa&s;t, the friend of man, the ornament of the hu|man race, the great, the illu&s;trious WASHING|TON is no more! <HI>For, behold, the Lord, the Lord of ho&s;ts, hath taken away from us, the &s;tay and the &s;taff&mdash;the mighty man, and the man of war, the judge&mdash;and the prudent, and the Ancient&mdash;the honorable man, and the Coun&s;ellor&mdash;and the eloquent orator.</HI> This is the man who&s;e death we deplore. The profe&s;&s;ed de&s;ign of our meeting is, "publicly to te&s;tify our grief" for this melancholy Providence. God grant that we may be &s;uitably affected with it, that we may feel this &s;troke of his rod, and receive cor|rection.</P>
<P>Tho the expre&s;&s;ions of &s;orrow with many, may be carried to an unpardonable exce&s;s, and wear the a&s;pect of idolatry to a fellow-creature, yet there is a manife&s;t propriety, that when the father either of a family, or of a country, is removed by death, the children &s;hould appear in the habili|ments and attitude of mourning. WASHING|TON was our father and friend; he is gone. Grat|itude and decency require that we &s;hould pay
<PB N="7" REF="037036_0005_100C37E077E7F748">
&s;uitable re&s;pect to his memory. It is a duty, &s;anc|tioned by rea&s;on, and al&s;o by cu&s;tom, from time immemorial. The holy &s;criptures relate various in&s;tances of the kind, with &s;eeming approbation. <HI>"When Mo&s;es died in the land of Moab</HI> (we are told) <HI>that all the children of I&s;rael mourned and wept for him, thirty days, in the plains of Moab.</HI> Al&s;o, <HI>when all the congregation &s;aw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron, thirty days, even all the hou&s;e of I&s;rael. And when Samuel died, all I&s;rael lamented him."</HI> The di&s;tingui&s;hed moral and patriotic vir|tues of the&s;e men, rendered them eminently &s;er|viceable to their country. Their lo&s;s was &s;everely felt by every friend to virtue, to religion, and their country's weal. Hence, they were long la|mented, and intombed in the memory of an affec|tionate people. And &s;hall our beloved WASH|INGTON, who has been in&s;trumental of equal or greater good in a political view, than &s;ome of them, be &s;oon forgotten? Forbid it, Heaven! Tho he be dead as to his mortal part, he lives in our memories; his example lives; his virtues live and &s;hall, while eternal ages roll. Our chil|dren's children and generations yet unborn, we tru&s;t, will experience the glorious effects of his la|bors and exploits. All who tread Columbia's happy ground, and breathe the air of genuine freedom; or who read the hi&s;tory, or hear the &s;ame of him, who brake the yoke of de&s;poti&s;m from
<PB N="8" REF="037036_0006_100C37E28028E4C0">
our necks, and taught America to be free, if a drop of virtuous blood flow in their veins, if they have any claim to benevolence, or the common feelings of men, will ri&s;e up and call him ble&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Can we better an&s;wer the de&s;ign of our meet|ing at this time, than to employ a few moments in contemplating the leading traits in the charac|ter of our departed friend; and while we feel grateful to the Father of mercies, for the be&s;tow|ment and long continuance of &s;o rich a ble&s;&s;ing, humble our&s;elves under this frown of his Provi|dence, in taking him away?</P>
<P>At an early period of life, did he begin his ca|reer of public &s;ervices, and not until the late pe|riod of almo&s;t <HI>"three&s;core years and ten"</HI> were his labors fini&s;hed; when he was relea&s;ed by the an|gel of death. At the age of little more than twenty two, when youth in general, but ju&s;t be|gin to a&s;&s;ume the rank and title of men, young WASHINGTON was chief Colonel of a regi|ment. As we were then &s;ubject to our parent Britain, and engaged with her in a war again&s;t our mutual foes, the French and Indians, it was our hero's lot to fight under the banner of the Engli&s;h Commander. When General Braddock was defeated, at the banks of the Monongahela, and lo&s;t the greater part of his army, Colonel WASHINGTON di&s;covered &s;o much martial &s;kill and bravery, both in the battle, and in collecting
<PB N="9" REF="037036_0007_100C37E4403F3798">
and conducting the retreat of the few who &s;ur|vived, as led many judicious men to progno&s;ti|cate his future greatne&s;s; And, it was then gen|erally believed, that had <HI>he</HI> had the command of the army, in&s;tead of being repul&s;ed, he would have gained a victory. After the clo&s;e of that war, he &s;erved his country in various re&s;pectable offices, &s;uch as Ju&s;tice of the Peace, Judge of the Court, &amp;c;.; which he filled with peculiar digni|ty and un&s;haken fidelity.</P>
<P>Here we leave him until a new &s;cene opens, when he is to take a more con&s;picuous part upon the theatre of public action.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the violent and oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ures adopted, by the imperious parliament of Great Britain, re&s;pecting her colonies here, by which, as well as by divers ba&s;e and in&s;idious arts, &s;he endeavored to reduce them to a &s;tate of &s;lave|ry; after frequent prayers, entreaties, and re|mon&s;trances, were addre&s;&s;ed to the throne, to no purpo&s;e; after every milder attempt for a redre&s;s of grievances proved abortive, America, as the la&s;t re&s;ort, has recour&s;e to arms. A leader is wanted to conduct her forth to battle. The pub|lic eye is immediately directed to WASHING|TON, who is appointed, by Congre&s;s, to the chief command of the American Armies. Incon|ceivable were the hard&s;hips he experienced, dur|ing a long and bloody war, which he bore with unparalleled firmne&s;s and equanimity of mind.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="037036_0008_100C37E635BE8F68">
At the head of troops, raw and undi&s;ciplined, at fir&s;t, deemed as rebels ri&s;en up again&s;t their law|ful &s;overeign, him&s;elf under the weight of a pro|&s;cription, thereby expo&s;ed to the bloody dagger of every midnight a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, as well as to open ene|mies of his own country, who might &s;lay him with the hope not only of impunity but of re|ward; he was called to attack a regular and powerful foe, experienced in the art of war, ac|cu&s;tomed to victory, and fighting under the au&s;|pices of a di&s;tingui&s;hed monarch, who might in|&s;pire them with courage and zeal for the combat. Under all the&s;e di&s;advantages, an eye of rea&s;on could &s;ee but a very faint pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s; <HI>a peradventure,</HI> or an <HI>if perhaps</HI> the enemy might by the interpo&s;ition of kind Providence, be obliged to withdraw, and America be &s;aved from ruin. How peculiar mu&s;t have been the feelings of our hero in this very critical &s;ituation, to reflect, that he mu&s;t actually conquer or die! For in his con|dition, to be vanqui&s;hed, was inevitable death. But far from being intimidated by this awful con&s;ideration, under the weight of which, the &s;pirits of many worthy men would have &s;unk, tru&s;ting (as we believe) in the God of armies, who &s;aves neither by few nor by many, putting his life in his hand, he bid defiance to every danger, and boldly marched again&s;t the enemies of his be|loved country.</P>
<P>Being frequenly repul&s;ed, at the beginning (as
<PB N="11" REF="037036_0009_100C37E8D18D7C08">
might rea&s;onably be expected, by a &s;uperior force) with the lo&s;s of many valuable lives, and others captured, among whom were officers of di&s;tinc|tion, and loo&s;ing e&s;pecially (in the year 1776) &s;ev|eral garri&s;ons of men and military &s;tores at the White Plains, &s;o called, finding him&s;elf reduced to a feeble &s;tate for aggre&s;&s;ion or &s;elf-defence, he was obliged to retreat in a long and tedious route, of ninety miles, thro the Jer&s;ies, to the river Del|aware. His army was greatly dimini&s;hed; the time of &s;ervice for the mo&s;t of them was expir|ed; and the few that remained were brought to the greate&s;t extremities for food and clothing. The number was finally reduced to &s;eventeen hun|dred,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At a later period of the war, he had but 1500 effective troops.</NOTE> and clo&s;ely pur&s;ued by the enemy. Many citizens, and tho&s;e too of di&s;tinction, daily revolt|ed to the royal &s;tandard. In this &s;ituation, our General was under the mo&s;t alarming apprehen|&s;ions for his own per&s;onal &s;afety, as well as for the fate of his country, which &s;eemed de&s;tined to in|evitable ruin. Who, but a WASHINGTON, could have retained the calm po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his mind in this dark and gloomy day! His reply to Colonel Reed, who an&s;wered in the language of di&s;couragement re&s;pecting any &s;upport from the inhabitants of Penn&s;ylvania, fully &s;hows the un|ruffled &s;tate of his &s;oul, when &s;urrounded with dangers, and plunged in the depths of adver&s;ity. "My neck, &s;ays he, (&s;troking it with his hand) does not feel as tho it was made for a halter.
<PB N="12" REF="037036_0010_100C37EB27A45C78">
We mu&s;t retire to Augu&s;ta County in Virginia. Numbers will be obliged to repair to us for &s;afe|ty; and me mu&s;t try what we can do in carry|ing on a predatory war; and, if overpowered, we mu&s;t cro&s;s the Alleghany Mountains, &amp;c;."</P>
<P>But &s;oon, kind Heaven interpo&s;ed, and fought for our American I&s;rael. The army was greatly augmented by order of Congre&s;s, as well as by volunteers of almo&s;t all de&s;cription of men who came in great numbers, to join them. And al|tho there were difficulties innumerable to en|counter, yet thro the &s;kill and bravery of our General, under the &s;miles of a merciful Provi|dence, divers advantages were gained over the enemy; and affairs, for a while, &s;eemed to wear a more favorable a&s;pect.</P>
<P>It is not our de&s;ign, however, to give a hi&s;tory of the revolutionary war. Our bu&s;ine&s;s is to notice &s;ome of the excellent virtues and qualifications of the &s;upreme commander. With what incompar|able fortitude did he &s;u&s;tain martial toils and dan|gers! How faithfully did he fulfill the important tru&s;t committed to him, when endowed with full power from Congre&s;s to appoint officers&mdash;" to reform and new modle the military arrangements"&mdash;and in fine to di&s;po&s;e of the per&s;ons and prop|erties of his fellow-citizens, (when exigencies re|quired it,) almo&s;t according to his plea&s;ure! With matchle&s;s &s;kill he managed the manoeuvres of war, &s;o as to avoid an engagement, unle&s;s he could do
<PB N="13" REF="037036_0011_100C37ECB16F6D10">
it on equal or advantageous ground, but improv|ing every opportunity to worry and harra&s;s the enemy, and ob&s;truct their progre&s;s.</P>
<P>He experienced a frequent &s;hift of fortune; &s;ometimes pro&s;perous&mdash;at others, in a &s;ituation the mo&s;t de&s;perate, when in his own opinion, nothing but the &s;tupidity and infatuation of the enemy could prevent his ruin.</P>
<P>In addition to the hazards of war, he had the mortification to find various attempts, in Con|gre&s;s, to di&s;place him from office, or to rai&s;e another over him. But Providence had de&s;ign|ed him as the deliverer of his country, and the divine purpo&s;es were not to be fru&s;trated. His behavior, on this and other trying occa&s;ions, was &s;uch as &s;poke at once the greatne&s;s of his &s;oul and his humble tru&s;t and dependance on that Being, who rules in the affairs of men, and di&s;|po&s;es them according to his plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Tho, in the cour&s;e of the war, he obtained &s;ev|eral victories which were far from incon&s;iderable ones, and &s;ome of them brilliant; it was not the number and &s;plendor of the&s;e which &s;o highly di&s;|tingui&s;hed his fame as a General, but the wi&s;dom and prudence he di&s;covered in determining when it might be expedient to engage the foe, when to forbear; and his faithfulne&s;s always to follow the determinations of his judgement, in matters of &s;uch moment. By his wi&s;dom, prudence, and
<PB N="14" REF="037036_0012_100C37EFAA7308F0">
fidelity, and expertne&s;s in the art of war, by the ble&s;&s;ing of the God of war, he carried us thro a long and painful &s;truggle for liberty&mdash;wholly de|feated the de&s;igns of Britain to en&s;lave us&mdash;and &s;ecured our peace, liberty, and independence. Having accompli&s;hed the important bu&s;ine&s;s, for which he was called to the command of our ar|mies, he re&s;igned his commi&s;&s;ion to the power that gave it, and again mingling with his fellow|citizens, retired to enjoy the &s;weets of dome&s;tic tranquillity.</P>
<P>But tho the independence of the United States was acknowledged, by the Court of Britain, and they were left to the calm po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their rights, they yet found them&s;elves in a very unhappy &s;it|uation, with re&s;pect to maintaining that liberty and independence, for which they had fought and bled. The articles of confederation, which were framed in the time of war, and well an&s;wer|ed their de&s;ign, when the &s;tates were united to|gether, from principles of &s;elf-defence again&s;t an invading foe; were found utterly inadequate to the purpo&s;e, in a time of peace and &s;ecurity from foreign danger. A new mode of government is formed; a Congre&s;s, con&s;i&s;ting of members from the &s;everal &s;tates, is elected, and WASH|INGTON, the man of war, is called to pre&s;ide in the Cabinet of the Nation.</P>
<P>Here his wi&s;dom, patrioti&s;m, and virtue, &s;hone with di&s;tingui&s;hed lu&s;tre. Unawed by popular
<PB N="15" REF="037036_0013_100C37F1A35201E8">
clamor, and the threats of a&s;piring demagogues, on the one hand, or by the complaints of tho&s;e who might wi&s;h for too rigid an admini&s;tration, on the other, he &s;tood firm and un&s;haken, amid political tumults and commotions, like a mighty rock amid the da&s;hing waves of the &s;ea. Actuat|ed by no party &s;pirit, and dete&s;ting the idea of foreign influence, he made the peace and wel|fare of his country his object, which he was ever concerned to promote.</P>
<P>While, with a &s;crupulous faith, he ob&s;erved the treaties and engagements with foreign pow|ers, his idea was that America ought not to put confidence in any other nation further, than it was for the intere&s;t of that nation to befriend her. Upon this principle, he thought it unrea&s;onable that we &s;hould continue our gratitude to France, after we had made her full compen&s;ation for her &s;ervices, and e&s;pecially when &s;he had actually be|come our enemy. All obligations to her for pa&s;t &s;ervices are now cancelled, and it is trea&s;onable to talk of gratitude to our country's foe. It was his wi&s;h, however, to ob&s;erve a neutral po&s;ition to|ward all the contending powers of Europe, and he i&s;&s;ued his proclamation for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The mea&s;ure was highly approved by the &s;u|preme legi&s;lature, as well as by the mo&s;t judicious and enlightened of their con&s;tituents. To this policy, which he had adopted, and which he &s;up|po&s;ed
<PB N="16" REF="037036_0014_100C37F331C41CC0">
both expedient and ju&s;t, he &s;trictly adher|ed in &s;pite of all the efforts of foreign intruders, or of the turbulent and &s;editious at home. The event fully ju&s;tified the mea&s;ure, and proved the wi&s;dom and prudence of adopting it. In con&s;e|quence hereof, America has enjoyed peace with all its concomitant ble&s;&s;ings, while in Europe the ear was grated with the horrid din of arms&mdash;the &s;treets flowed with human blood&mdash;and every brea&s;t was filled with con&s;ternation and terror.</P>
<P>AMERICANS! It is owing to the labors of your faithful WASHINGTON, accompanied with the ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven, that war, with all its hor|rors and direful effects, is not now experienced in our land. Yea, let us look further back and &s;ay, to his faithful &s;ervices, under God, we are indebted for our liberty and independence; for our very exi&s;tence as a nation. But for him, you might have &s;till been under the yoke of bondage to a foreign nation, or bound with fetters of iron. Long ere this day, your children might have been torn from your arms&mdash;your wives from your bo&s;|oms, and &s;acrificed to the rage, or brutality of mon&s;ters, in human form. It becomes you then, this day, gratefully to remember that he carried you thro a long and bloody war; for you, he was <HI>in perils,</HI> not only among open enemies, but <HI>in perils among fal&s;e brethren;</HI> for you, he fought and bled; defeated the murderous de&s;igns of your enemies&mdash;and gave you a re&s;pectable rank
<PB N="17" REF="037036_0015_100C37F5CCB34C08">
among the nations of the earth. And tho, ex|ce&s;&s;ively fond of dome&s;tic retirement, he he&s;itated not at the unanimous call of his country, to &s;acri|fice every partial de&s;ire to the general good. Be|hold him placed at the head of a free and enlight|ened nation! Which event excited joy in every brea&s;t; and gladened every countenance. Twice, by the unanimous &s;uffrages of the people, he was called to the pre&s;idential chair. The third time, he was excu&s;ed at his own pre&s;&s;ing de&s;ire, which he was plea&s;ed to think perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with duty, and a regard for the public welfare.</P>
<P>Short was his enjoyment of the plea&s;ures ac|companying a rural and dome&s;tic life. A diabol|ical phren&s;y &s;eizes a foreign power; unrea&s;onable complaints are made of inju&s;tice and partiality; our commerce is ob&s;tructed; ho&s;tilities are actual|ly committed upon our &s;eamen; war is threaten|ed under the &s;pecious pretence of retaliation for injuries, which in fact never exi&s;ted. His coun|try calls, and WASHINGTON again &s;teps forth from his loved retirement, into public action. He is appointed <HI>General and Commander in chief of all the armies rai&s;ed, or to be rai&s;ed, for the &s;ervice of the United States.</HI> The main object was to repel the expected inva&s;ions of our apo&s;tate allies; a po|tent and in&s;idious nation. He accepted the ap|pointment with that profound humility, mode&s;ty, and diffidence, with which he had accepted every other; which are generally indications of real
<PB N="18" REF="037036_0016_100C37F833274E70">
worth; and the u&s;ual concomitants of a truly great and good man. His letter to the Pre&s;i|dent, on the important occa&s;ion, breathes a &s;pirit of genuine love to his country; of indignation at the infamous conduct of its enemies; and en|tire confidence in the admini&s;trations of our gov|ernment.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that our beloved WASHING|TON was not a patriot; that he was not a true friend to the country that gave him birth, and in who&s;e immediate &s;ervice, he &s;pent the mo&s;t of his life. Now, if there where no &s;in in a&s;per&s;ing the character of the greate&s;t and be&s;t of men, I would not hazard the a&s;&s;ertion under the price of my own reputation, that he, who &s;erved his country in various important &s;tations for more than forty years, who for a con&s;iderable and the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed part of which, would accept no compen&s;ation, and who&s;e manife&s;t probity and uprightne&s;s of conduct, during this long period were unparelleled by any of &s;imilar circum&s;tances in the annals of time; I would not for my hon|ors &s;ake ri&s;que the a&s;&s;ertion, that this venerable character was not a friend to his country and its welfare. Let the &s;hameful and ill-grounded &s;u&s;|picion be forever bani&s;hed from the brea&s;t of Americans. If our illu&s;trious friend did not po&s;|&s;e&s;s true patrioti&s;m, the &s;ublime virtue exi&s;ts no where, but in a dreaming imagination. Who is a patriot, but one who loves his country? Who
<PB N="19" REF="037036_0017_100C37F9C18338E8">
loves his country, but he who improves all op|portunities to do her good? Who has ever done this, if WASHINGTON has not? He has &s;pent his life and &s;trength in her &s;ervice, without any con&s;iderable reward but that of fame. Ungrate|ful is the wretch, who by &s;lander and reproach, would deprive him of this &s;mall pittance. His heart mu&s;t be harder than adamant; <HI>his tongue is &s;et on fire of Hell.</HI></P>
<P>Tho great minds are not ea&s;ily moved with trifling occurrences, yet they undoubtedly have feeling, as well as any of us. The arrows of &s;lander mu&s;t affect them in a very &s;en&s;ible manner, e&s;pecially when coming from tho&s;e in who&s;e &s;er|vice they are employed, and from whom, they might rea&s;onably expect the mo&s;t unfeigned friend&s;hip and pure&s;t affection. "O, (methinks I hear him &s;ay) it was not an avowed enemy that thus reproached me; then I could have borne it, neither was it he that profe&s;&s;edly hated me, that did magnify him&s;elf again&s;t me; then I would have hid my&s;elf from him; but it was thou, mine acquaintance&mdash;my countryman&mdash;we took &s;weet coun&s;el together&mdash;we fought and bled together for &s;elf-defence again&s;t our mutual foes.

wickedne&s;s,) I mu&s;t fir&s;t become an enemy to my|&s;elf. But I appeal to your&s;elves&mdash;I appeal to ev|ery impartial mind whether in my own nation or el&s;ewhere&mdash;I appeal to the tribunal of my own brea&s;t; nay further, I appeal to the tribunal of Heaven, which takes cognizance of all human thoughts and actions, whether I have not always &s;ought the be&s;t intere&s;ts of my country. A zeal for your &s;afety and happine&s;s influenced me, at fir&s;t, to put my life in my hand, and engage in the horrors of war again&s;t an implacable enemy; not knowing whether I &s;hould be called <HI>literally</HI> to &s;pill my blood in the unhappy conte&s;t. But, a merciful God has &s;pared me, that I might be fur|ther &s;erviceable to you. Thus, I have waded thro &s;eas of blood, expo&s;ed to every danger, enduring incredible hard&s;hips for your &s;akes; and have ever endeavored to act the part of a tender parent toward you. I am now grown grey in your &s;er|vice; and were it nece&s;&s;ary, would freely &s;acrifice my life for your good. Then, be not &s;o uncan|did as to think me your enemy; nor ungrate|fully pierce that heart with the &s;hafts of calumny, which has ever been engaged to promote your be&s;t intere&s;t."</P>
<P>But what do we &s;ay? We had almo&s;t forgotten that our venerable friend is far beyond the reach of calumny, and the reproaches of ungrateful men. He is gone, we tru&s;t, <HI>where the wicked cea&s;e from troubling, and where the weary are at re&s;t.</HI> How

&s;hall we &s;uitably improve this righteous Provi|dence of God, in depriving us of one of the great|e&s;t and be&s;t of men, at this critical period, when his pre&s;ence is &s;o much needed to give &s;tability to our union; energy to our government; courage to our armies; and terror to our foes? Let us gratefully record the divine goodne&s;s in the be|&s;towment of one, who has long been to us a ten|der father and faithful friend; and humble our|&s;elves under the &s;olemn con&s;ideration, that for our &s;ins, he hath in judgment taken him away. This is the rod of God's anger, wherewith he often puni&s;hes a froward people in this world. Ble&s;&s;ings which are ungratefully received and mi&s;improved are often withdrawn, at a time, when they are greatly needed. The &s;troke of his rod upon us, at this time, is heavy, but it mu&s;t be borne;&mdash;yea, the con&s;ideration that we are guil|ty, and that God has a right to puni&s;h us, &s;hould induce us <HI>patiently</HI> to &s;ubmit. This does not ex|clude a realizing &s;en&s;e of our lo&s;s, or a public manife&s;tation of our grief on the account of it. On &s;uch an occa&s;ion as this, not to mourn, would argue in&s;en&s;ibility indeed, if not the blacke&s;t in|gratitude! But how &s;hall we mourn in &s;uch a manner as to excite the compa&s;&s;ion of our God, and gain the approbation of our own minds? It is the ob&s;ervation of a great poet,

what was probably the wi&s;h of our departed friend re&s;pecting us. I verily believe, my brethren, <HI>that his heart's de&s;ire and daily prayer, for us was,</HI> not only that we might faithfully di&s;charge the duties we owe to our country and to one another, but that we might reverence religion, and &s;erve the God of our fathers with &s;inglene&s;s of heart. What el&s;e was the language of his own conduct? He was profe&s;&s;edly a believer in our holy religion, and altho he was not, by <HI>profe&s;&s;ion,</HI> a preacher of it, he he&s;itated not, on what he judged &s;uitable occa&s;ions, to inculcate piety and virtue, both as our duty, and as the "great pillars of human happine&s;s." In his addre&s;s to the fir&s;t Congre&s;s, under the new Con&s;titution, he mo&s;t devoutly acknowledges the &s;upreme government of the great Jehovah, with our entire dependence on his ruling Providence, and obligations to him for all ble&s;&s;ings of whatev|er nature or kind. It is a&s;&s;erted, by his intimate acquaintance, that in his private life, he was pious and exemplary; that he was con&s;tant in his clo&s;et devotions, and particularly in times of difficulty and danger, he failed not to a&s;k coun&s;el at the throne of grace. Nor did he neglect the public wor&s;hip of his Maker and chri&s;tian &s;acraments, as the manner of too many is.</P>
<P>O, how would the vicious and profane&mdash;the wicked of every cla&s;s &s;hudder, and &s;hrink into nothing, in the pre&s;ence of &s;uch a character! How gladly then will they call upon the rocks and

<P>Let us, as a &s;uitable improvement of the death of our worthy friend, &s;trive to imitate his &s;ublime virtues, public and private, according to our &s;ev|eral capacities and &s;pheres of action; e&s;pecially his fervent piety, which is nece&s;&s;ary for per&s;ons in the meane&s;t &s;tation, as well as in the highe&s;t. Let his holy example live in our memories; and his moral and patriotic; virtues be deeply imprinted in our hearts.</P>
<P>His death, it is &s;aid, was agreeable to the tenor of his life. He was unterrified at its awful ap|proach, and bore it with entire &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of Heaven. How does this &s;olemn event, and the manner of it, teach us both the power of re|ligion, and the vanity and in&s;ufficiency of human wi&s;dom and greatne&s;s to ward off the fatal arrow!
