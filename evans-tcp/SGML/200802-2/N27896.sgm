<HEAD>THE HISTORY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>MR. FANTOM was a retail trader in the city of London. As he had no turn to any expen&s;ive vices, he was reckoned a &s;ober decent man, but he was covetous and proud, &s;elfi&s;h and conceited. As &s;oon as he got forward in the world, his vanity began to di&s;|play it&s;elf, but not in the ordinary me|thod, that of making a figure and living away; but &s;till he was tormented with a longing de&s;ire to draw public notice, and to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf. He felt a ge|neral &s;en&s;e of di&s;content at what he was,
<PB N="3" REF="037161_0003_100CDE4E5CDADB28">with a general ambition to be &s;ome|thing which he was not; but this de&s;ire had not yet turned it&s;elf to any particu|lar object. It was not by his money he could hope to be di&s;tingui&s;hed, for half his acquaintance had more, and a man mu&s;t be rich indeed, to be noted for his riches in London. Mr. Fan|tom's mind was a prey to vain imagi|nations. He de&s;pi&s;ed all tho&s;e little acts of kindne&s;s and charity which eve|ry man is called to perform every day, and while he was contriving grand &s;chemes which lay quite out of his reach, he neglected the ordinary duties of life which lay directly before him.</P>
<P>About this time he got hold of a fa|mous little book written by the NEW PHILOSOPHER, who&s;e pe&s;tilent doctrines have gone about &s;eeking whom they may de&s;troy; the&s;e doctrines found a ready entrance into Mr. Fantom's mind: a mind at once &s;hallow and inqui&s;itive, &s;peculative and vain, ambitious and di&s;&s;atisfied. As almo&s;t every book was new to him, he fell into the common error of tho&s;e who begin to read late in life, that of thinking that what he did
<PB N="4" REF="037161_0004_100CDE5006C8B1C0">not know him&s;elf, was equally new to others; and he was apt to fancy that he and the author he was reading were the only two people in the world who knew any thing. This book led to the grand di&s;covery; he had now found, what his heart panted after, a way to <HI>distinguish himself.</HI> To &s;tart out a full grown philo|&s;opher at once, to be wi&s;e without edu|cation, to di&s;pute without learning, and to make pro&s;elytes without argument, was a &s;hort cut to fame, which well &s;uit|ed his vanity and his ignorance. He re|joiced that he had been &s;o clever as to examine for him&s;elf, pitied his friends who took things upon tru&s;t, and was re|&s;olved to a&s;&s;ert the freedom of his own mind. To a man fond of bold novel|ties and daring paradoxes, &s;olid argu|ment would be flat, and truth would be dull, merely becau&s;e it is not new. Mr. Fantom believed not in proportion to the &s;trength of the evidence, but to the impudence of the a&s;&s;ertion. The trampling on holy ground with dirty &s;hoes, the &s;mearing the &s;anctuary with filth and mire, the calling prophets and apo&s;tles by the mo&s;t &s;currilous names
<PB N="5" REF="037161_0005_100CDE5225944128">was new, and da&s;hing, and dazzling. Mr. Fantom now being &s;et free from the chains of &s;lavery and &s;uper&s;tition, was re&s;olved to &s;how his zeal in the u&s;ual way, by trying to free others, but it would have hurt his vanity had he known that he was the convert of a man who had written only for the vul|gar, who had <HI>invented</HI> nothing, no not even one idea of original wickedne&s;s; but who had &s;tooped to rake up out of the kennel of infidelity, all the loath|&s;ome dregs and offal dirt, which politer unbelievers had thrown away as too gro&s;s and offen&s;ive for their better bred readers.</P>
<P>Mr. Fantom, who con&s;idered that a philo&s;opher mu&s;t &s;et up with a little &s;ort of &s;tock in trade, now picked up all the common place notions again&s;t Chri&s;tian|ity, which have been an&s;wered a hun|dred times over; the&s;e he kept by him ready cut and dried, and brought out in all companies with a zeal which would have done honor to a better cau&s;e, but which the friends to a better cau&s;e are not &s;o apt to di&s;cover. He &s;oon got all the cant of the new &s;chool. He talked of <HI>narrow|ness,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="037161_0006_100CDE54064E5D58">and <HI>ignorance,</HI> and <HI>bigotry,</HI> and <HI>prejudice,</HI> and <HI>priestcraft,</HI> on the one hand; and on the other of <HI>public good,</HI> the <HI>love of mankind,</HI> and <HI>liberality,</HI> and <HI>candour,</HI> and <HI>toleration,</HI> and above all, <HI>benevolence.</HI> Benevolence, he &s;aid, made up the whole of religion, and all the other parts of it were nothing but cant and jargon and hypocri&s;y. Finding however, that he made little impre&s;&s;ion on his old club at the Cat and Bagpipes, he grew tired of their company, yet there was one member who&s;e &s;ociety he could not re&s;olve to give up, though they &s;eldom agreed, as indeed no two men in the &s;ame cla&s;s and habits of life could le&s;s re&s;emble each other. Mr. Trueman was an hone&s;t, plain, &s;imple hearted trade&s;man of the good old cut, who feared God and followed his bu&s;i|ne&s;s, he went to church twice on Sun|days and minded his &s;hop all the week, &s;pent frugally, gave liberally, and &s;a|ved moderately.</P>
<P>Mr. Fantom re&s;olved to retire for a while into the country, and devote his time to his new plans, &s;chemes, theo|ries, and project for the public good.
<PB N="7" REF="037161_0007_100CDE57144C7110">A life of talking, and reading, and wri|ting, and di&s;puting, and teaching, and pro&s;elyting now &s;truck him as the only life, &s;o he &s;oon &s;et out for the country with his family, to which was now ad|ded his new footman, William Wil&s;on, whom he had taken with a good charac|ter out of a &s;ober family. He was no &s;ooner &s;ettled than he wrote to invite Mr. Trueman to come and pay him a vi&s;it, for he would have bur&s;t if he could not have got &s;ome one to whom he might di&s;play his new knowledge, he knew that if on the one hand Mr. Trueman was no &s;cholar, yet on the other he was no fool, and though he de&s;pi&s;ed his <HI>prejudices,</HI> yet he thought he might be made a good decoy duck, for if he could once bring Trueman over, the whole club at the Cat and Bag|pipes might be brought to follow his ex|ample, and thus he might &s;ee him&s;elf at the head of a &s;ociety of his own pro&s;e|lytes, the &s;upreme object of a philo&s;o|pher's ambition. Trueman came ac|cordingly. He &s;oon found that howe|ver he might be &s;hocked at the impious doctrines his friend maintained, yet that
<PB N="8" REF="037161_0008_100CDE592D1D0E98">an important le&s;&s;on might be learnt even from the wor&s;t enemies of truth; name|ly, an ever-wakeful attention to their grand object. If they &s;et out with talk|ing of trade or politics; of private news or public affairs &s;till Mr. Fantom was ever on the watch to hitch in his dar|ling doctrines; whatever he began with, he was &s;ure to end with a pert &s;quib at the Bible, a vapid je&s;t on the clergy, the mi&s;eries of &s;uper&s;tition and the ble&s;&s;ings of philo&s;ophy. "Oh!" &s;aid Trueman to him&s;elf, "when &s;hall I &s;ee Chri&s;tians half &s;o much in earne&s;t? Why is it that almo&s;t all zeal is on the wrong &s;ide?"</P>
<P>"Well, Mr. Fantom," &s;aid Trueman next day at breakfa&s;t, "I am afraid you are leading but an idle &s;ort of life here." "Sir," &s;aid Fantom, "I now begin to live to &s;ome purpo&s;e; I have indeed lo&s;t too much time, and wa&s;ted my talents on a little retail trade, in which one is of no note; one can't di&s;tingui&s;h one's &s;elf." "So much the better," &s;aid Trueman, "I had rather not di&s;tingui&s;h my&s;elf, unle&s;s it was by leading a better life than my neighbours. There is no|thing
<PB N="9" REF="037161_0009_100CDE5AE1449618">I &s;hould dread more than being talked about. I dare &s;ay now heaven is in a good mea&s;ure filled with people who&s;e names were never heard out of their own &s;treet or village. So I beg leave <HI>not</HI> to di&s;tingui&s;h my&s;elf." "Yes, but one may if it is only by &s;igning one's name to an e&s;&s;ay or a paragraph in a new&s;paper," &s;aid Fantom. "Heaven keep John Trueman's name out of a new&s;paper," interrupted he in a fright, for it mu&s;t either be found in the old Bailey or the Bankrupt Li&s;t, unle&s;s in|deed I were to remove &s;hop, or &s;ell off my old &s;tock." "But in your pre&s;ent confined &s;ituation you can be of no u&s;e," &s;aid Fantom. "That I deny." inter|rupted the other. "I have filled all the pari&s;h offices with &s;ome credit. I never took a bribe at an election, no not &s;o much as a treat; I take care of my ap|prentices, and don't &s;et them a bad ex|ample by running to plays and Sadler's Wells in the week, or jaunting about in a gig all day on Sundays; for I look upon it that the country jaunt of the ma&s;ter on Sundays expo&s;es his &s;ervants
<PB N="10" REF="037161_0010_100CDE5C824F9550">to more danger than their whole week's temptations in trade put together."</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fantom.</SPEAKER>
<P>I once had the &s;ame vulgar prejudices about the Church and the Sabbath, and all that antiquated &s;tuff. But even on your own narrow princi|ples, how can a thinking being &s;pend his Sunday better "if he mu&s;t have any Sunday at all" than by going into the country to admire the works of nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e you mean the works of God; for I never read in the Bible that nature made any thing. I &s;hould rather think that &s;he her&s;elf was made by him who made all things; by him, who, when he &s;aid <HI>thou shalt not murder,</HI> &s;aid al&s;o, <HI>thou shalt keep holy the Sabbath Day.</HI> But now do you really think that all that multitude of coaches, chariots, chai&s;es, vis-a-vis, booby&mdash;hutches, &s;ulkies, &s;ociables, phae|tons, gigs, curricles, cabrioles, chairs, &s;tages, plea&s;ure carts and hor&s;es, which crowd our roads; all tho&s;e country hou|&s;es within reach, to which the London friends pour in to the gorgeous Sunday fea&s;t, which the &s;ervants are kept from church to dre&s;s; all tho&s;e public hou|&s;es
<PB N="11" REF="037161_0011_100CDE5E19A2DDC0">under the &s;igns of which you read the&s;e alluring words, AN ORDINARY ON SUNDAYS; I &s;ay, do you believe that all tho&s;e hou&s;es and carriages are cram|med with philo&s;ophers who go on Sun|days into the country to admire the works of nature as you call it? In|deed, from the reeling gait of &s;ome of them when they go back at night, one might take them for a certain &s;ect cal|led the <HI>tipling</HI> philo&s;ophers. Then in an&s;wer to your charge that a little trade&s;|man can do no good, I mu&s;t tell you that I belong to the &s;ociety for relieving pri&s;oners for &s;mall debts, and to the &s;ick man's friend, and to&mdash;</P>

<SPEAKER>Fantom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, enough&mdash;all the&s;e are petty occupations.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then they are better &s;uit|ed to petty men of petty fortune. I had rather have an ounce of real good done with my own hands, and &s;een with my own eyes, than &s;peculate about do|ing a ton in a wild way which I know can never be brought about.</P>

<SPEAKER>Fantom.</SPEAKER>
<P>I de&s;pi&s;e a narrow field. O for the reign of univer&s;al benevolence!

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear me! &s;ure that mu&s;t be a whole&s;ale &s;ort of a job; had not you better try your hand at a town or a pari&s;h fir&s;t?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fantom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I have a plan in my head for relieving the mi&s;eries of the whole world. Every thing is bad as it now &s;tands. I would alter all the laws, and do away all the religions, and put an end to all the wars in the world. I would every where redre&s;s the inju&s;|tice of fortune, or what the vulgar call providence. I would put an end to all puni&s;hments, I would not leave a &s;ingle pri&s;oner on the face of the globe. This is what I call doing things on a grand &s;cale. "A &s;cale with a vengeance," &s;aid Trueman. "As to relea&s;ing the pri&s;oners, however I don't &s;o much like that, as it would be plea&s;ing a few rogues at the expen&s;e of all hone&s;t men; but as the re&s;t of your plan, if all <HI>Christian countries would be so good as to turn Christians,</HI> it might be helped on a good deal. There would be &s;till mi&s;e|ry enough left indeed, becau&s;e God in|tended
<PB N="13" REF="037161_0013_100CDE62F1BE8710">this world &s;hould be earth and not heaven. But &s;till bani&s;hing religi|on from the world would be like &s;tri|king of all the pounds from an overchar|ged bill; and all the troubles which would be left, would be reduced to mere &s;hillings, pence, and farthings, as one may &s;ay."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fantom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your project would rivet the chains which mine is de&s;igned to break.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I have no projects. Projects are in general the offspring of re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, vanity, and idlene&s;s. I am too bu&s;y for Projects, too contented for Theories, and I hope have too much hu|mility for a philo&s;opher. The utmo&s;t extent of my ambition at pre&s;ent is, to redre&s;s the wrongs of a pari&s;h 'prentice who has been cruelly u&s;ed by his mat|ter; indeed I have another little &s;cheme, which is to pro&s;ecute a fellow in our &s;treet who has let a poor wretch in a work-hou&s;e, of which he had the care, peri&s;h through neglect, and you mu&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fantom.</SPEAKER>
<P>The pari&s;h mu&s;t do that, as to me I own that the wrongs of the
<PB N="14" REF="037161_0014_100CDE65369F2398">Poles and South Americans &s;o fill my mind, as to leave me no time to attend to the petty &s;orrows of workhou&s;es and pari&s;h 'prentices. It is provinces, em|pires, continents, that the benevolence of the philo&s;opher embraces; every one can do a little paltry good to his next neighbour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every one can, but I don't &s;ee every one does. If they would, indeed, your bu&s;ine&s;s would be ready done to your hands, and your grand ocean of benevolence would be filled with the drops which private charity would throw into it. I am glad, howe|ver, you are &s;uch a friend to the pri&s;on|ers, becau&s;e I am ju&s;t now getting a lit|tle &s;ub&s;cription from our club, to &s;et free your poor old friend Tom Saunders, a very hone&s;t brother trade&s;man, who got fir&s;t into debt, and then into goal, through no fault of his own, but merely through the pre&s;&s;ure of the times. We have each of us allowed a little trifle every week towards maintaining Tom's young family &s;ince he has been in pri&s;on, but we think we &s;hall do much more &s;ervice to Saunders, and indeed in the end lighten our own expence, by
<PB N="15" REF="037161_0015_100CDE66ED361CA8">paying down at once a little &s;um to re|&s;tore to him the comforts of life, and put him in a way of maintaining his fa|mily again. We have made up the mo|ney all except five guineas, I am alrea|dy promi&s;ed four, and you have nothing to do but to give me the fifth. And &s;o for a &s;ingle guinea, without any of the trouble, the meetings, and the looking into his affairs, which we have had, you will at once have the plea&s;ure "and it is no &s;mall one" of helping to &s;ave a worthy family from &s;tarving, of redeem|ing an old friend from goal, and of put|ting a little of your boa&s;ted benevolence into action. Realize! Ma&s;ter Fantom, there is nothing like realizing. "Why, hearkee, Mr. Trueman," &s;aid Fantom &s;tammering, and looking very black, "don't think I value a guinea; no Sir, I de&s;pi&s;e money, 'tis tra&s;h, 'tis dirt, and beneath the regard of a wi&s;e man. 'Tis one of the unfeeling inventions of ar|tificial &s;ociety. Sir I could talk to you for half a day on the abu&s;e of riches, and on my own contempt of money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>O Pray don't give your|&s;elf the trouble, it will be an ea&s;ier way
<PB N="16" REF="037161_0016_100CDE6992DD1230">by half of proving both, ju&s;t to put your hand in your pocket and give me the guinea without &s;aying a word about it; and then to you who value time &s;o much and money &s;o little, it will cut the mat|ter &s;hort. But come now (for I &s;ee you will give nothing) I &s;hould be mighty glad to know what is the &s;ort of good you do your&s;elves, &s;ince you always object to what is done by others. "Sir," &s;aid Mr. Fantom, "the object of a true phi|lo&s;opher is to diffu&s;e light and know|ledge. I wi&s;h to &s;ee the whole world enlightened."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Amen! if you mean with the light of the Go&s;pel. But if you mean that one religion is as good as another, and that no religion is the be&s;t of all; in &s;hort, if you want to make the whole world philo&s;ophers, why they had better &s;tay as they are. But as to the true light, I wi&s;h it to reach to the very lowe&s;t, and I therefore ble&s;s God for Charity Schools, as in&s;truments of diffu&s;ing it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fantom.</SPEAKER>
<P>who had no rea&s;on to expect that his friend was going to call upon him for a &s;ub&s;cription on this account,
<PB N="17" REF="037161_0017_100CDE6BFA3DBE88">ventured to prai&s;e them. Saying, "I am no enemy to the&s;e in&s;titutions. I would indeed change the object of in|&s;truction, but I would have the whole world in&s;tructed."</P>
</SP>
<P>Here Mrs. Fantom, who with her daughter had quietly &s;at by at their work, ventured to put in a word, a liberty &s;he &s;eldom took with her hu&s;band, who in his zeal to make the world free and hap|py, was too prudent to include his wife. "Then my dear," &s;aid &s;he, "I wonder you don't let your own &s;ervants be taught a little. The maids can &s;carcely tell a letter, or &s;ay the Lord's Prayer; and you know you won't allow them time to learn. William too has never been at church &s;ince we came out of town. He was at fir&s;t very orderly and obedi|ent, but now he is &s;eldom &s;ober of an evening, and in the morning when he &s;hould be rubbing the tables in the par|lour, he is generally lolling upon them and reading your little manual of the new philo&s;ophy." "Mrs. Fantom," &s;aid her hu&s;band angrily, "you know that my labours for the public good, leave me little time to think of my own
<PB N="18" REF="037161_0018_100CD5F366846D88">family. I mu&s;t have a great field, I like to do good to hundreds at once."</P>
<P>"I am very glad on that papa," &s;aid Mi&s;s Polly, "for then I hope you won't refu&s;e to &s;ub&s;cribe to all tho&s;e pretty children at the Sunday School as you did ye&s;terday, when the gentleman came a begging, becau&s;e that is the very thing you were wi&s;hing for; there are two or three hundred to be done good to at once."</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well Mr. Fantom, you are a wonderful man to keep up &s;uch a &s;tock of benevolence at &s;o &s;mall an ex|pence. To love mankind &s;o dearly and yet avoid all opportunities of doing them good; to have &s;uch a noble zeal for the millions, and to feel &s;o little compa&s;&s;ion for the units; &s;urely none but a philo&s;opher could indulge &s;o much philanthrophy and &s;o much frugality at the &s;ame time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fantom.</SPEAKER>
<P>I de&s;pi&s;e the man who&s;e benevolence is &s;wallowed up in the nar|row concerns of his own family, or pa|ri&s;h, or country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, now I have a noti|on that 'tis as well to do one's own duty
<PB N="19" REF="037161_0019_100CDE6DB7FB4C80">as that of another man, and to do good at home as well as abroad, and I had as leave help Tom Saunders to freedom as a Pole or a South American, though I &s;hould be very glad to help them too, but one mu&s;t begin to love &s;omewhere, and to do good &s;omewhere; and I think 'tis as natural to love one's own family and to do good in one's own neighbour|hood as to any body el&s;e. And if every man in every family, pari&s;h, and coun|ty, did the &s;ame, why! all the &s;chemes would meet, and the end of one pari&s;h where I was doing good would be the beginning of another where &s;omebody el&s;e was doing good; &s;o my &s;chemes would jut into my neighbours, and all would fit with a &s;ort of dove-tail ex|actne&s;s."</P>
</SP>
<P>Here they were told dinner was on ta|ble. "Don't think," &s;aid Mr. Fantom" that you have the be&s;t of the argument, becau&s;e you happen to have the la&s;t word. We will fini&s;h our talk &s;ome other time" So &s;aying they went in to dinner.</P>
<P>When they &s;at down, Mr. Fantom was not a little out of humour, to &s;ee his table in &s;ome di&s;order. William
<PB N="20" REF="037161_0020_100CDE6F97CE8350">was al&s;o rather more negligent than u&s;u|al. If the company called for bread, he gave them beer, and he took away the clean plates, and gave them dirty ones. Mr. Fantom &s;oon di&s;covered that his &s;ervant was very drunk; he flew into a violent pa&s;&s;ion, and ordered him out of the room, charging him that he &s;hould not appear in his pre&s;ence in that conditi|on. William obeyed; but having &s;lept an hour or two, and got about half &s;ober, he again made his appearance. His ma&s;ter gave him a mo&s;t &s;evere repri|mand, and called him an idle, drunken, vicious fellow. "Sir," &s;aid William, very pertly, "if I do get drunk now and then, I only do it for the good of my country, and in obedience to your wi&s;hes." Mr. Fantom, thoroughly pro|voked, now began to &s;cold him in words not fit to be repeated, and a&s;ked him what he meant. "Why, Sir," &s;aid William, "you are a philo&s;opher you know and I have often overheard you &s;ay to your company that private vices are public benefits, and &s;o I thought that getting drunk was as plea&s;ant a way of doing good to the public as any, e&s;pe|cially
<PB N="21" REF="037161_0021_100CDE719540A898">when I could oblige my ma&s;ter at the &s;ame time."</P>
<P>"Get out of my hou&s;e," &s;aid Mr. Fantom in a great rage." "I do not de|&s;ire to &s;tay a moment longer, &s;o pay me my wages." "Not I, indeed," replied the ma&s;ter, nor will I give you a char|acter, &s;o never let me &s;ee your face again." William took his ma&s;ter at his word and not only got out of the hou&s;e, but out of the country too as fa&s;t as po&s;|&s;ible. When they found he was really gone, they made a hue-and-cry, in or|der to detain him till they had exami|ned if he had left every thing in the hou&s;e as he had found it. But William had got out of reach, knowing he could not &s;tand &s;uch a &s;crutiny. On exami|nation, Mr. Fantom found that all his port was gone, and Mrs. Fantom mi&s;&s;ed three of her be&s;t new &s;poons. William was pur&s;ued but without &s;ucce&s;s, and Mr. Fantom was &s;o much di&s;compo&s;ed, that he could not for the re&s;t of the day talk on any &s;ubject but his wine and his &s;poons, nor harangue on any project but that of recovering both by bringing William to ju&s;tice.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="037161_0022_100CDE73AF5B8CE8">Some days pa&s;&s;ed away, in which Mr. Fantom having had time to cool, began to be a&s;hamed that he had been betray|ed into &s;uch ungoverned pa&s;&s;ion. He made the be&s;t excu&s;e he could, &s;aid no man was perfect, and though he owned he had been too violent, yet he &s;till ho|ped William would be brought to the puni&s;hment he de&s;erved. "In the mean time," &s;aid Mr. Trueman, "Seeing how ill philo&s;ophy has agreed with your man, &s;uppo&s;e you were to &s;et about teaching your maids a little religion?" Mr. Fantom coolly replied, "that the impertinent retort of a drunken footman could not &s;poil a &s;y&s;tem. "Your &s;y|&s;tem, however, and your own behavi|our," &s;aid Trueman, "have made that footman a &s;coundrel: and you are an|&s;werable for his offences." "Not I tru|ly," &s;aid Fantom, "he has neither &s;een me cheat, gamble, nor get drunk: and I defy you to &s;ay I corrupt my &s;ervants. I am a moral man, Sir." Mr. Fantom," &s;aid Trueman, "if you were to get drunk every day, and game every night, you would indeed endanger your own &s;oul, and give a dreadful example to
<PB N="23" REF="037161_0023_100CDE75C7B18350">your family; but great as tho&s;e &s;ins are, and God forbid that I &s;hould attempt to le&s;&s;en them, &s;till they are not wor&s;e, nay, they are not &s;o bad as the pe&s;tilent doc|trines with which you infect your hou&s;e and neighbourhood. A bad action is like a &s;ingle murder, but a wicked principle is throwing lighted gunpowder into a town, it is poi&s;oning a river; there are no bounds, no certainty, no end to it's mi&s;chief. The ill effects of the wor&s;t action may cea&s;e in time, and the con&s;equences of your example may end with your life; but &s;ouls may be brought to perdition by a wicked principle, after the author of it has been dead for ages.</P>

<P>You take all your notions of the Deity from the vulgar views your Bible gives you of him." "To be &s;ure I do," &s;aid Trueman, "can you tell me any way of getting a better notion of him? I don't want any of your farthing-candle philo&s;ophy in the broad &s;un-&s;hine of the Go&s;pel, Mr. Fantom. My Bible tells me that <HI>God is love,</HI> not merely lo|ving, but LOVE. Now do you think a Being who&s;e very e&s;&s;ence is love, would permit any mi&s;ery among his children here, if it was not to be, &s;ome way or other, or &s;omewhere or other, for their good? You forget too that in a world where there is &s;in there mu&s;t be mi&s;ery. There too, I &s;uppo&s;e, God permits mi|&s;ery partly to exerci&s;e the &s;ufferers and partly to try the pro&s;perous; for by trouble God corrects &s;ome and tries o|thers. Suppo&s;e now, Tom Saunders had not been put in pri&s;on, you and I&mdash;no, I beg pardon, <HI>you</HI> &s;aved your guinea, well then, our club and I could not have &s;hown our kindne&s;s by getting him out, nor would poor Saunders him&s;elf have
<PB N="25" REF="037161_0025_100CDE7A25CFC770">had an opportunity of exerci&s;ing his own patience under want and impri|&s;onment. So you &s;ee one rea&s;on why God permits mi&s;ery, is that good men may have an opportunity of le&s;&s;ening it." Mr. Fantom replied, "There is no object which I have more at heart; I have as I told you a plan in my head of &s;uch univer&s;al benevolence as to include the happine&s;s of all mankind." "Mr. Fantom," &s;aid, Trueman, "I feel that I have a general goodwill towards all my brethren of mankind; and if I had as much money in my pur&s;e as I have love in my heart, I tru&s;t I &s;hould prove it; all I &s;ay is, that in a &s;tation of life where I can't do much, I am more called upon to pro|cure the happine&s;s of a poor neighbour who has no one el&s;e to look to, than to form wild plans for the good of mankind too exten&s;ive to be accompli&s;hed, and too chimerical to be put in practice. I can't free whole countries, nor reform the evils of &s;ociety at large, but I <HI>can</HI> free an aggrieved wretch in a workhou&s;e, and I can reform my&s;elf and my own family,</P>
</SP>
<P><PB N="26" REF="037161_0026_100CDE7C5D0F83A0">Some weeks after a letter was brought to Mr. Fantom from his late &s;ervant William, who had been turned away for drunkenne&s;s, as related in the former part of this hi&s;tory, and who had al&s;o robbed his ma&s;ter of &s;ome wine and &s;ome &s;poons. Mr. Fantom glancing his eye over the letter &s;aid, it is dated from Chelmsford jail; that ra&s;cal is got into pri&s;on. I am glad of it with all my heart, it is the fitte&s;t place for &s;uch &s;coun|drels. I hope he will be &s;ent to Botany Bay, if not hanged." "O ho! my good friend, &s;aid Trueman, then I find that in aboli&s;hing all pri&s;ons you would ju&s;t let one &s;tand for the accomodation of tho&s;e who &s;hould happen to rob <HI>you.</HI>" Mr. Fantom drily ob&s;erved, that he was not fond of jokes, and proceeded to read the letter. It expre&s;&s;ed an earne&s;t wi&s;h that his late ma&s;ter would conde|&s;cend to pay him one vi&s;it in his dark and doleful abode, as he wi&s;hed to &s;ay a few words to him, before the dreadful &s;en|tence of the law, which had already been pronounced &s;hould be executed."</P>
<P>"Let us go and &s;ee the poor fellow," &s;aid Trueman, "it is but a morning's
<PB N="27" REF="037161_0027_100CDE7EAB100088">ride. If he is really &s;o near his end it would be cruel to refu&s;e him." "Not I truly," &s;aid Fantom, "he de&s;erves no|thing at my hands but the halter he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> likely to meet with. Such port is not to be had for money, and the &s;poons part of my new dozen." "As to the wine," &s;aid Trueman, "I am afraid you mu&s;t give that up, but the only way to get any tidings of the &s;poons is to go and hear what he has to &s;ay; I have no doubt but he will make &s;uch a confe&s;&s;ion as may be very u&s;eful to others, which you know, is one grand advantage of puni&s;hments; and be&s;ides, we may afford him &s;ome lit|tle comfort." "As to comfort he de|&s;erves none from me," &s;aid Fantom, "and as to his confe&s;&s;ions they can be of no u&s;e to me, but as they give me a chance of getting my &s;poons, &s;o I don't much care if I do take a ride with you."</P>
<P>When they came to the pri&s;on Mr. Trueman's tender heart &s;unk within him. He deplored the corrupt nature of man, which makes &s;uch rigorous confinement needful, not merely for the puni&s;hment of the offender, but for the &s;afety of &s;o|ciety. Fantom, from mere trick and
<PB N="28" REF="037161_0028_100CDE80D0B4A068">habit, was ju&s;t preparing a &s;peech on ge|neral benevolence, and the cruelty of im|pri&s;onment, till the recollection of his old port and his new &s;poons cooled his ardour, and he went on without &s;aying a word. When they reached the cell where the un|happy William was confined they &s;topped at the door. The poor wretch had thrown him&s;elf on the ground, as well as his chains would give him leave. He groan|ed piteou&s;ly, and was &s;o &s;wallowed up with a &s;en&s;e of his own mi&s;eries, that he neither heard the door open, nor &s;aw the gentlemen. He was attempting to pray, but in an agony which made his words hardly intelligible. Thus much they could make out.&mdash;"God be merci|ful to me a &s;inner&mdash;the chief of &s;inners!" then &s;uddenly attempting to &s;tart up, but prevented by his irons, he roared out, "O God! thou can&s;t <HI>not</HI> be merci|ful to me for I have denied thee; I have ridiculed my Saviour who died for me; I have derided his word, I have re&s;i&s;ted his &s;pirit. I have laughed at that heaven which is &s;hut again&s;t me, I have denied tho&s;e torments which await me. To|morrow!
<PB N="29" REF="037161_0029_100CDE83460CE788">to-morrow! O for a longer &s;pace for repentance. O for a &s;hort re|prieve from hell."&mdash;Mr. Trueman wept &s;o loud that it drew the attention of the criminal, who now lifted up his eyes, and ca&s;t on his late ma&s;ter a look &s;o dread|ful, that Fantom wi&s;hed for a moment that he had given up all hope of the &s;poons rather than have expo&s;ed him&s;elf to &s;uch a &s;cene. At length the poor wretch &s;aid, in a voice that would have melted a heart of &s;tone, "O Sir, are you there? I did wi&s;h to &s;ee you before my dreadful &s;entence is put in executi|on." Oh Sir! to-morrow to-morrow! But I have a confe&s;&s;ion to make to you." This revived Mr. Fantom, who again ventured to glance a hope at the &s;poons. "Sir, &s;aid William "I could not die without making my confe&s;&s;ion." "Aye, and re&s;titution too I hope," replied Fan|tom. "Where are my &s;poons?"&mdash;"Sir, they are gone with the re&s;t of my wretch|ed booty. But Oh, Sir! the&s;e &s;poons make &s;o petty an article in my black ac|count that I hardly think of them. Mur|der, Sir, murder is the crime for which I am ju&s;tly doomed to die. Oh, Sir!
<PB N="30" REF="037161_0030_100CDE84E13C2DC0">Who can dwell with everla&s;ting burn|ings?" As this was a que&s;tion which even a philo&s;opher could not an&s;wer, Mr. Fantom was going to &s;teal off, e&s;pe|cially as he now gave up all hope of the &s;poons; but William called him back. &mdash;"Stay, Sir, &s;tay, I conjure you, as you will an&s;wer it at the bar of God. You are the cau&s;e of my being about to &s;uffer a &s;hameful death. Yes, Sir, you made me a drunkard, a thief, and a mur|derer. How dare you, William," cried Mr. Fantom, with great emotion, "ac|cu&s;e me with being the cau&s;e of &s;uch hor|rid crimes?" "Sir," an&s;wered the cri|minal, "from you I learnt the principles which lead to tho&s;e crimes. By the grace of God I &s;hould never have fallen into &s;ins de&s;erving of the gallows if I had not often overheard you &s;ay there was no hereafter, no judgment, no future reckoning. O, Sir! there is a hell, dreadful, inconceivable, eternal!" Here through the exce&s;s of angui&s;h, the poor fellow fainted away. Mr. Fantom, who did not at all reli&s;h this &s;cene, &s;aid to his friend, "well Sir, we will go if you
<PB N="31" REF="037161_0031_100CDE87798887E8">plea&s;e, for you &s;ee there is nothing to be done."</P>
<P>"Sir," replied Mr. Trueman, mourn|fully, "you may go if you plea&s;e, but I &s;hall &s;tay, for I &s;ee there is a great deal to be done." "What," rejoined the other, "do you think it po&s;&s;ible his life can be &s;aved?" "No, indeed," &s;aid Trueman, "but I hope it is po&s;&s;ible his &s;oul may be &s;aved." "I don't under|&s;tand the&s;e things," &s;aid Fantom, ma|king towards the door. "Nor I neither," &s;aid Trueman, "but as a fellow &s;inner I am bound to do what I can for this poor fellow. Do you go home Mr. Fan|tom and fini&s;h your treati&s;e on univer|&s;al benevolence, and the ble&s;&s;ed effects of philo&s;ophy; and hark ye, be &s;ure you let the fronti&s;piece of your book re|pre&s;ent <HI>William on the gibbet:</HI> that will be what our par&s;on calls a PRACTICAL ILLUSTRATION. You know I hate the|ories; this is <HI>realizing:</HI> this is PHILO|SOPHY made ea&s;y to the meane&s;t capaci|ty."</P>
<P>Mr. Fantom &s;neaked off to fini&s;h his
<PB N="32" REF="037161_0032_100CDE897704F600">work at home, and Mr. Trueman &s;taid to fini&s;h his in the pri&s;on. He pa&s;&s;ed the night with the wretched convict, he prayed with him and for him, and read to him the penetential p&s;alms, and &s;ome portions of the Go&s;pel. But he was too humble and too prudent a man to ven|ture out of his depth by arguments and con&s;olations, which he was not warrant|ed to u&s;e, (this he left for the mini&s;ter.) But he pre&s;&s;ed on William the great du|ty of making the only amends now in his power to tho&s;e whom he had led a&s;tray. They then drew up the follow|ing paper which Mr. Trueman got printed, and gave away at the place of execution.</P>

<HEAD>THE La&s;t Words, Confe&s;&s;ion, and Dying Speech OF <HI>WILLIAM WILSON,</HI> Who was executed at CHELMSFORD for Murder.</HEAD>
<P>"I was bred up in the fear of God, and lived with credit in many &s;ober fa|milies, in which I was a faithful &s;ervant. But being tempted by a little higher wa|ges, I left a good place to go and live with Mr. Fantom, who, however, made good none of his fine promi&s;es, but pro|ved a hard ma&s;ter. In his &s;ervice I was not allowed time to go to church. This troubled me at fir&s;t, till I over|heard my ma&s;ter &s;ay, that going to church was a &s;uper&s;titious prejudice, and only meant for the vulgar. Upon this I re&s;olved to go no more; for I
<PB N="34" REF="037161_0034_100CDE8D84739A48">thought there could not be two religions, one for the ma&s;ter, and one for the &s;er|vant. Finding my ma&s;ter never prayed, I too left off praying, this gave &s;atan great power over me, &s;o that I from that time fell into almo&s;t every &s;in. I was very unea&s;y at fir&s;t, and my con&s;cience gave me no re&s;t; but I was &s;oon recon|ciled by overhearing my ma&s;ter and an|other gentleman &s;ay, that death was on|ly a long &s;leep, and hell and judgment were but an invention of prie&s;ts to keep the poor in order. I mention this as a warning to all ma&s;ters and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es to take care what they conver&s;e about while &s;ervants are waiting at table. They cannot tell how many &s;ouls they have &s;ent to perdition by &s;uch loo&s;e talk. The crime for which I die is the natural con&s;equence of the principles I learnt of my ma&s;ter. A rich man, in|deed, who throws off religion, may e&s;|cape the gallows, becau&s;e want does not drive him to commit the crimes which lead to it; but what &s;hall re&s;train a nee|dy man, who has been taught that there is no dreadful reckoning? Oh, my dear, fellow &s;ervants! take warning by
<PB N="35" REF="037161_0035_100CDE8F1A22FE88">my &s;ad fate, never be tempted away from a &s;ober &s;ervice for the &s;ake of a little more wages. Never venture your immortal &s;ouls in hou&s;es where God is not feared. And now hear me, O my God, though I have bla&s;phemed thee; Forgive me, O my Saviour! though I have denied thee. O Lord mo&s;t holy, O God mo&s;t mighty, deliver me from the bitter pains of eternal death! and receive my &s;oul for his &s;ake who died for &s;inners.</P>

This pious mini&s;ter never cared to tell me what he thought of William's &s;tate.
