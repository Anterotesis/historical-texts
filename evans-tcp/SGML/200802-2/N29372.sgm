<P>SINGULARLY brilliant was the &s;tation, and in the highe&s;t degree important the part allotted unto Mo&s;es. To him it was a&s;&s;igned by the Creator and Go|vernor of the Univer&s;e, to aba&s;e the de&s;pot Pharoah, to afflict the idolatrous Egyptians, to redre&s;s and de|liver the long en&s;laved Hebrews: and finally to per|form the many prodigies which have excited the a&s;|toni&s;hment and commanded the veneration of that and of all &s;ucceeding generations. But to pre&s;erve and fit him for the accompli&s;hment of the&s;e divine purpo&s;es, what &s;ingular providences attended him, e|ven from the moment which announced his birth.&mdash;by parental affection at the ri&s;k of life he is pre&s;erved from the murderous mandate of a policy unexampled in cruelty; by maternal ingenuity buoy'd above the devouring &s;urges of the Nile. In this moment of pe|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">il divine providence interpo&s;es, an a&s;ylum opens <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">u&s;e of his enemy. The daughter of Pharoah (and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e of her hardened &s;ire) beholds with compa&s;&s;ion the weeping babe. Adopting him for her own &s;on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he immortalizes her memory as the pious patrone&s;s of the greate&s;t of Prophets. Whil&s;t under her &s;of|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="5 letters">g care the foundation of his future greatne&s;s is laid&punc; for &s;cience irradiating his mind; he becomes &s;killed in all the wi&s;dom of the Egyptians. But now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ived at his fortieth year, and beholding an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> brother feebly contending with a too power|ful

and in&s;ulting Egyptian, he, under an impul&s;ive pre&s;entiment, &s;lays the petty de&s;pot. But his breth|ren, not knowing that by him is their future deliv|erance to be wrought, refu&s;e his mediation in their quarrels; and ungenerou&s;ly threatening his life he is con&s;trained to fly for refuge to the land of Midian, where generou&s;ly &s;uccouring the daughters of Jethro', he tarries in the land, and becomes the &s;on-in-law of Midian's prie&s;t. Po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of true greatne&s;s, he chear|fully exchanges the &s;plendours of a court for the &s;im|plicity of the pa&s;toral life; and during an exile of forty years, in undecaying vigour, partakes all the en|joyments of dome&s;tic bli&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT I&s;rael's oppre&s;&s;ions wax heavier, their groanings penetrate the &s;kies, their God comes down to deliver them, their champion is forced from his beloved &s;o|litude, he mu&s;t now endure the gaze of the multitude, the bu&s;tle of a court, and amid&s;t the toils and anxie|ties of a camp &s;pend the re&s;idue of his devoted days. But he goes not a warfare at his own expence, he is commi&s;&s;ioned to Pharoah, and arrayed in divine ar|mour, his rod becomes a &s;erpent; it is &s;tretched forth, the waters of Egypt become blood; he predicts, and murrain and blain arre&s;t both man and bea&s;t; the li&s;ting up of his hand is more terrible than armies with banners. It is the &s;ignal, and reptiles and locu&s;ts in ho&s;ts innumerable devour the bla&s;ted crops. The &s;un al&s;o refu&s;es his chearing beams, and fire, hail, and tem|pe&s;t fill with con&s;ternation the &s;mitten and de&s;pond|ing Egyptians. At this period it was that the eleva|tion of character mentioned in our text was a&s;cribed to the Hebrew champion, viz. that <HI>"The man Mo&s;es was very great in the Land of Egypt, in the &s;ight of Pharoah's &s;ervants, and in the &s;ight of the people."</HI>&mdash;But how much greater will he pre&s;ently appear, when according to his word we behold the &s;udden fall of Egypt's fir&s;t born, the emancipation and triumphant march of I&s;rael's ho&s;ts, when at the &s;tretching forth of his rod the red &s;ea cleaves in &s;under, and for I&s;rael rears on either hand its adamantine walls; and when

on the &s;ame &s;ignal it entombs Pharaoh and his pur|&s;uing legions. But we cannot trace through forty years the progre&s;s of his ri&s;ing greatne&s;s, &s;uffice it to ob&s;erve, that as the Jews beheld in Mo&s;es (as the in&s;trument of divine providence) the founder of their religion and in&s;titutor of their civil polity: So to him as an hi&s;torian and prophet are all nations indebted for the only genuine elements of the hi&s;tory of man; and accurate developement of the true principles of morality; whil&s;t in his mighty works, the friend of religion, adoringly, beholds di&s;played the finger of his God.</P>
<P>BUT the doctrinal inference which we would here deduce for the theme of this occa&s;ion is, The providence of God over human affairs; and more e&s;pecially as di&s;played in his rai&s;ing up at eventful periods, preeminently di&s;tingui&s;hed characters, for the accompli&s;hment of purpo&s;es in the highe&s;t degree benevolent. Tracing then, briefly the&s;e providen|tial di&s;pen&s;ations, we will advert to them as relating to the Jewi&s;h nation&mdash;as di&s;played towards the Gen|tiles&mdash;and la&s;tly, as affecting the mo&s;t important in|tere&s;ts of the&s;e highly favoured States.</P>
<P>As to the Jewi&s;h nation, we behold their fathers &s;eeking in Egypt an a&s;ylum from famine. To their de&s;cendants it proves an hou&s;e of bondage. But are the purpo&s;es of Abraham's God now baffled, or &s;hall his promi&s;es fail of accompli&s;hment&mdash;nay in the pre|dicted deliverence of his covenant people and over|throw of their ta&s;k-ma&s;ters, we behold pourtrayed, in the mo&s;t &s;triking characters, his compa&s;&s;ion for the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and indignation again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ors. Yes, ye oppre&s;&s;ed Poles&mdash;ye long en&s;laved &s;ons and daugh|ters of Africa! ye haple&s;s children of bondage, in every age and nation, in I&s;rael's deliverance behold the certain pledge of your own&mdash;Whil&s;t in Pharoah's overthrow, ye tyrants of the earth, learn to anticipate your own &s;wiftly approaching doom.&mdash;But e'er I&s;|rael has reached the promi&s;ed land, is their venera|ble

deliverer called to &s;leep with his fathers! Still they are not for&s;aken&mdash;their God he &s;lumbereth not&mdash;the faithful and valiant Jo&s;hua leads them over Jor|dan. The iniquity of the Amorites is now full, and their land becomes the inheritance of more faithful I&s;rael. But is Jo&s;hua al&s;o called to go the way of all fle&s;h, and is back-&s;liding, but now penitent I&s;rael, groaning under the yoke of &s;urrounding nations&mdash;behold in their turns what champions are rai&s;ed up, a Samp&s;on, a Jephtha, a Gideon, a David, an Elijah and Eli&s;ha, a Jeho&s;ephat and Jo&s;iah, and a Judas Maccabeus.</P>
<P>BUT when the Lord called Abraham and his po&s;|terity did he ca&s;t away the Gentiles? Regarded then no more the God of the univer&s;e the nations whom him&s;elf had formed. Nay even among&s;t the Gentiles is found the patient and perfect Job, the approved Cyrus, and pious Cornelius, and over the intere&s;ts and concerns of all nations and individuals does the common parent of all, uncea&s;ingly extend his watch|ful Providence. In the fall of Bel&s;hazzar, and tri|umphs of the Medes and Per&s;ians, we behold redre&s;|&s;ed the wrongs of pro&s;trate nations. The Per&s;ians degenerate, and in their turn are the &s;poilers of the earth; how are their innumerable ho&s;ts di&s;comfited at Marathon! and how their perverted power ut|terly broken by Macedonia's impetuous youth. Is it de&s;igned that Greece &s;hould in her politics exhibit the models of well ordered communities; that in her liberty &s;hould long di&s;play her all-invigorating influence; and that as the lamp of &s;cience and the re|fined arts, &s;he &s;hould &s;hine on &s;urrounding and re|mote&s;t nations. But to con&s;titute this very Greece, or to pre&s;erve it from enemies potent and malignant; how at &s;ucce&s;&s;ive and eventful periods, as the in&s;truments of God, do ari&s;e an Homer and Solon, a Lycurgus and Thales, a Socrates, and Ari&s;totle, a Demo&s;thenes, a Themi&s;tocles and Ari&s;tides, with others not le&s;s il|lu&s;trious</P>

Is Rome to become next the theatre of events au|&s;picious unto man? Is a greater than Mo&s;es, under her jurisdiction, &s;eat to di&s;pel the mi&s;ts of &s;uper&s;tition, which long had degraded the character and deba&s;ed the hearts of men? Is he in miracles more numerous and benevolent than the prodigies of Mo&s;es to pro|claim him&s;elf at once the Prince and the Me&s;&s;enger of Peace? Is he, and are his Apo&s;tles, to di&s;&s;eminate through the nations that religion which, uniting man to man, in the &s;acred bonds of brotherhood; and which by faith elevating them to union with the Father of Spirits brings into vi&s;ion the regions of im|mortal felicity?</P>
<P>To effect then purpo&s;es, &s;o &s;uperlatively bene|ficial, it becomes expedient that Rome &s;hould ari&s;e, &s;hould extend her influence, civilize barbarians, unite di&s;tant and remote provinces, and e&s;tabli&s;h through her wide domain, laws equal and uniform. But to rear and &s;u&s;tain a fabric &s;o &s;tupendous, belonged not to feeble hands, it required the prowe&s;s and talents of a Romulus and Numa&mdash;a Brutus and Poplicola&mdash;a Cincinnatus and Fabius. The amiable Scipios, and others, with genius and virtues no le&s;s tran&s;cendant. Nor have modern nations and times been de&s;titute of characters great, amiable, and illu&s;trious. Britain ju&s;tly boa&s;ts her great Alfred&mdash;France (even repub|lican France) her Henry the Fourth. With Doria's greatne&s;s towers that of his country. Helvetia produ|ces the illu&s;trious Tell. And even barbarous Ru&s;&s;ia receives with the arts a poli&s;h from her fir&s;t Peter.</P>
<P>BUT whil&s;t the Ea&s;tern Continents thus &s;oar each in its turn to di&s;tingui&s;hed greatne&s;s, the We&s;tern, though more va&s;t in extent, various in its climes, and luxuriant in its productions, is but too much a blank in the &s;y&s;tem of the univer&s;e; for with &s;ome excep|tions it is but the haunt of the mon&s;ters of the wil|derne&s;s; or of men &s;carce le&s;s ferocious than their brethren of the de&s;ert.

It is true when Britain's canvas whiten'd the ocean, when it groan'd beneath the ho&s;ts of her mercenaries, myriads of brave men, in who&s;e e&s;timation death was preferable to bondage, &s;uddenly aro&s;e in their coun|try's defence, but as ardour without di&s;cipline, and valour without order are impotent, &s;o multitudes without a leader mu&s;t have yielded in the day of con|flict&punc; on WASHINGTON then every eye was fixed; in him all hearts confided. Au&s;picious choice! he that at three and twenty &s;agely coun&s;elled Braddock; who with his gallant Virginians &s;aved from the tom|ahawk and &s;calping knife, legions of flying veterans; will not in the &s;anguine field di&s;appoint his country's expectations.&mdash;Nor will that citizen who in rural &s;cenes, or legi&s;lative councils for twenty years, hath evinced the combination of public and private vir|tues and abilities when victorious &s;ubvert the vin|dicated

rights of his native land. Illu&s;trious man&punc; thy fame be&s;trides the Univer&s;e. Poets &s;ing thy mighty deeds, and orators pourtray thy many virtues; and yet thy character needs only the hi&s;torian's faithful pen, &s;imple narration is alone &s;ufficient; for &s;o di|ver&s;ified and numerous are thy great actions, that they contain in them&s;elves embelli&s;hments beyond the pow|ers of feeble art. But as cu&s;tom hath authorized, and as the circum&s;tances of the day may require &s;ome tribute to his memory, permit me to attempt a faint portraiture of the Mount-Vernon Hero. The cha|racter of WASHINGTON to be ju&s;tly appreciated, and properly under&s;tood, mu&s;t be contemplated in a variety of lights. It is military, it is political, it is moral, and it may al&s;o be e&s;timated from compari&s;on. Nor will this variety exhau&s;t it, it is like the pure gold which dimini&s;hes not in the crucible. His mi|litary talents altho' the mo&s;t &s;plendid, yet perhaps were the lea&s;t e&s;timable trait in his high character; not that his abilities in the field were &s;lender, but be|cau&s;e the &s;cience of &s;laughter &s;eems to partake in it|&s;elf of the nature of calamity; and is only valuable from its averting evils of greater magnitude. De|fen&s;ive warfare is alone rational and ju&s;t; and it was in this that our Fabius peculiarly excelled. Yes, he was the man of whom truly it hath been &s;aid, "his prudence &s;aved what valor would have lo&s;t." But in what a cau&s;e is he engaged, the liberties of his country. The independence of numerous &s;tates, the glory of a ri&s;ing and va&s;t republic hanging dubious in the pendant &s;cale; on the one hand are hords of veterans with every implement of de&s;truction, led on by chiefs long drilled in military &s;cience; on the o|ther are the &s;ons of freedom, but often few in number, half armed, conflicting with hunger, nakedne&s;s and want; but WASHINGTON is there; the die is ca&s;t, the &s;cale preponderates, and Columbia's chief, crowned with victory, and rewarded with the applaud|ing voice of his grateful country, like another Cin|cinnatus, retires to his beloved &s;cenes of hu&s;bandry.</P>
<P>But as in his military atchievements, with prudence the mo&s;t con&s;ummate, he di&s;played dauntle&s;s courage&punc; and a fortitude that was invincible; &s;o in his politi|cal
<PB N="10" REF="039116_0009_10136E73744462E8">
capacity he was no le&s;s tran&s;cendant. When he a&s;&s;umed the highe&s;t &s;tation in the Federal Govern|ment, that government was it&s;elf, but in imperfect o|peration&punc; no precedents to guide his dubious way, he mu&s;t him&s;elf originate them. In Europe already had the fermentation of Liberty, of Tyranny, and of Crimes, mingled their chaotic ma&s;s. With that country the&s;e &s;tates were connected by exi&s;ting trea|ties. There the political horizon darkened, tremen|dous concu&s;&s;ions were felt, revolution &s;ucceeded re|volution; whil&s;t civil liberty, religion, morality, rea|&s;on and property, became alternately the &s;port of conflicting factions, of regal tyrants, or of philo&s;o|phi&s;ing lunatics. And whil&s;t the mo&s;t di&s;a&s;trous of wars laid wa&s;te the faire&s;t provinces of the world, this country though di&s;tant three thou&s;and miles, yet it was menaced by the approaching and dire calamity. But if with the pre&s;ervation of our faith with all na|tions, we yet enjoy &s;o great a mea&s;ure of peace, and if in tho&s;e days of adver&s;ity which &s;eldom have had a parallel, &s;uch a tide of unexampled pro&s;perity has flowed in on us, I would a&s;k, to whom, under provi|dence are we indebted? Or who hath parried from us the blow, which robbing us of peace, would have wre&s;ted from us, this accumulating good? Is it not to WASHINGTON we are thus indebted? and was it not his quick, di&s;cerning mind, which fore&s;eeing, repelled the efforts of our foes, by his well-timed pro|clamation of neutrality. But whil&s;t the fir&s;t intere&s;ts of his high charge, were thus &s;ecured under his guar|dian eye, need you be informed that tho&s;e of &s;maller magnitude were al&s;o duly cheri&s;hed under his fo&s;ter|ing hand; you have &s;een it in his repeated Addre&s;&s;es to both Hou&s;es of the Federal Legi&s;lature; in his in|comparable Farewell Addre&s;s, and uniformly through his illu&s;trious admini&s;tration of eight years. The virtues of WASHINGTON demand now attention; but though thus mentioned &s;ub&s;equent to his military and political talents, it is not from a &s;uppo&s;ition that they were either le&s;s evident, or le&s;s valuable. The evi|dences of his virtues were &s;o brilliant and irre&s;i&s;table as to convince enemies and annihilate &s;u&s;picion. And &s;o important is virtue it&s;elf, as ever to tran&s;cend all

other gifts or acquirements however &s;plendid. An able General, or profound Politician, if de&s;titute of ju&s;tice, of integrity, or compa&s;&s;ion, or what is the &s;ame thing, if void of the fear of God, from whence tho&s;e virtues originate, may become like Arnold, a traitor, or like Attilla, "the &s;courge of God;" but if power or intere&s;t invites, never like WASHING|TON, the benefactor of his Country. The victory which this illu&s;trious man obtained over his pa&s;&s;ions, how did it elevate him above the Ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ian, who was lately the chief dependence of the leagued monarchs. Suwarrow grown grey in victory, and conqueror in thirty pitched battles, meets with a &s;ingle repul&s;e in Switzerland, his haughty &s;oul chagrined, and brood|ing over his di&s;a&s;ter, feels all the mortification of de|feat. He who had predicted that like a tyger he &s;hould howl in Italy, now in rage retiring to Lindau, and yielding to all the impotence of pa&s;&s;ion, in his chamber growls like a mon&s;ter in his den. But WASHINGTON with the &s;ame dignified compo|&s;ure, as when victorious, he received a check, or &s;u&s;|tained defeat; for re&s;igned to and confiding in the God of Battles, even from di&s;a&s;ter he &s;oon finds means to originate fre&s;h victories.</P>
<P>IT is &s;ometimes the frailty of even great men, to be avaricious; the alloy in others is the undue love of power. Had any tincture of the former been in the heart of the man we all admire, the corrupt|ing millions of Britain would have di&s;covered the contaminated &s;pot, had the latter been his propen&s;ity, he had the opportunity to have become a &s;econd Cromwell. But as the virtues of Wa&s;hington were luminous &s;o they were al&s;o &s;olid; and for this rea&s;on becau&s;e they originated from the fear of his Creator; and becau&s;e they originated here, they were uniform through the variety of high &s;tations which he filled, and from this uniformity, aro&s;e that peculiarity of character, by which he is &s;o pre-eminently di&s;tin|gui&s;hed.</P>
<P>MILITARY Talents alone, have often procured the appellation of greatne&s;s to their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors; politi|cal abilities have been viewed as meriting the &s;ame reward, and &s;uperior virtue is &s;elf-evidently more

worthy of it, than either; but when in one man we thus behold the concentration of them all, and of them all in &s;o tran&s;cendant a degree; we di&s;cover a &s;ubli|mity and elevation of character, but rarely if ever found among&s;t the frail de&s;cendants of Adam.</P>
<P>BUT in e&s;timating this high character from com|pari&s;on,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Some little addition is here <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; from a di&s;cour&s;e delivered by the Author. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n Sunday, Jan; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">th; 1880; from I Thes.

<P>WE mu&s;t remember that WASHINGTON was a member of the fir&s;t Congre&s;s. That he accepted the chief command of the Colonial Armies when &s;ubjec|tion would have denominated him the leader of re|bellion. That through a long and arduous &s;truggle he had not only an army to command, but in &s;ome mea&s;ure al&s;o; that army to create. That his final tri|umph was the e&s;tabli&s;hment of his country's inde|pendence. That in the Convention which origina|ted the admired fabric of our Federal government he filled the fir&s;t and mo&s;t influential place.&mdash;That as he was the fir&s;t, &s;o he was twice unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en to be the Magi&s;trate who &s;hould guide the &s;upreme councils of the newly con&s;tructed government.&mdash;That though &s;tricken in years, the voice of his coun|try finds him once more obedient to her call, and rea|dy if needful to lead her vigorous youth again&s;t the embattled foe. And la&s;tly, That when his cup of human felicity is full, his country rejoicing around him, and he ju&s;t about to &s;tep into the infirmities of old age&punc; he in peace is called to &s;leep with his fathers; and with a placid confidence worthy of his former greater greatne&s;s, bids his la&s;t adieu to terre&s;trial ob|jects; I a&s;k where, among&s;t men is the greatne&s;s that can compare with his?

Doria and Tell, tho' great of &s;tature were not half his height. The fir&s;t Brutus bore &s;ome re&s;emblance, but he fell in battle, e'er his country's

cau&s;e was vindicated; in &s;hort to form the portrait|ure of our hero, you mu&s;t &s;elect the wi&s;dom of a So|lon, the integrity of an Ari&s;tides, the amiablene&s;s of the Scipios, the prudence of a Fabius, the &s;implicity and greatne&s;s of Cincinnatus, with the piety and pro&s;|perity of Cyrus: concentrate the&s;e and you behold a WASHINGTON</P>
<P>BUT what is human glory? or what the life of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious? The one is a vapor&mdash;the other like the fading flower.&mdash;Oh death&punc; potent is thine arm; Kings ha&s;t thou &s;lain and Nobles ha&s;t ca&s;t down&mdash;but now greater is thy triumph, for before thee the mighty is fallen&mdash;the man of war&mdash;the pru|dent&mdash;the ancient&mdash;the honourable. Venerable Pa|rent of thy country! vain for thee are now our plaints. The tears of millions confe&s;s to thee in vain the weight of obligation&mdash;thou art now beyond the reach of mortal tribute&mdash;with thy God alone is the mea&s;ure of thy actions, with him the weight of thy reward.</P>
<P>THE numerous te&s;timonials of gratitude, di&s;|played throughout the&s;e States; although they en|hance not the bli&s;s of our regretted Benefactor; yet they may &s;timulate &s;ucce&s;&s;ors high in office, to tread a luminous path already traced; and by impre&s;&s;ing on our national character the ideas of ability to di&s;cern, and eagerne&s;s, to reward merit, may contribute to wipe from Republics, the reproach of jealou&s;y and ingratitude towards their mo&s;t brilliant and de&s;erv|ing &s;ons. But whil&s;t we thus &s;ecure the character of being grateful and political, let us not forfeit that of being religious; let nothing that is done favour of idolatry; let not that tribute be paid to a creature, that is due to God alone; from &s;econd cau&s;es let our gratitude, our affections, our hopes, all a&s;cend to the great, the fir&s;t, the only, the tran&s;cendant cau&s;e of all. If WASHINGTON was prepared, was rai&s;ed up, was girded with &s;trength, and made victorious, to Jehovah alone belongeth the high prai&s;e, to him who rai&s;ed up the wi&s;e, the illu&s;trious, the mighty of all ages&mdash;and who, &s;hould we need, and be found worthy of them, will rai&s;e up yet to us, heroes and deliverers not le&s;s excelling.</P>
<P>PAUSING now to contemplate the &s;ubjects thus

di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, we di&s;cover an error no le&s;s popular than pernicious, viz. the modern doctrine of the equality of man. That all men have (unle&s;s forfeited by crimes) an equal claim to the unmole&s;ted po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of liberty, of property and life, none but the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, the robber, or the de&s;pot will deny. And chri&s;tianity in maintaining our de&s;cent from one fir&s;t pair, pro|claims aloud our equality in nature. But when we behold the tran&s;cendant characters from Mo&s;es down to Wa&s;hington, va&s;t inequalities appear. We then perceive men, ri&s;ing above men, even as the lofty pine or towering cedar out tops the &s;hrubs on which the cattle brow&s;e. And how e&s;&s;ential this variety, without it there were no heroes to have re&s;cued from oppre&s;&s;ion, no Columbus to have led our way acro&s;s the dreary deep&mdash;no Sages, Prophets or Apo&s;tles who teach the way to God&mdash;no accommodating arti&s;t nor ingenuity which yields embelli&s;hment&mdash;no Newton &s;crutinizing nature's poize&mdash;nor Her&s;chel, who, to bring us tidings, traver&s;ed the lunar orb&mdash;nor yet a Bacon making vi&s;ible the micro&s;copal world.</P>
<P>AND thro' this variety, are we not admoni&s;hed of the expediency of order, and &s;ubordination in &s;ocie|ty? Is not the latter as an army in the day of con|flict, where in&s;ubordination yields but defeat and ru|in? Or is it not a body politick, with an head and various members; all &s;uited to their &s;everal offices; no part &s;uperfluous, but each e&s;&s;ential, to the vigour, health and &s;afety of the whole? Nor let us be di&s;|couraged, &s;hould ours be an inferior &s;tation in this body. The part alloted us, if adapted to our talents is the only one we can perform with honour or ad|vantage. Let us remember, that in the e&s;timation of God it is not greatne&s;s but goodne&s;s that is rewarda|ble with bli&s;s. And that &s;uperior talents, abu&s;ed or neglected here, will receive hereafter but the greater condemnation; whil&s;t the meane&s;t talent faithfully occupied in this life, will through the rewards of grace in Chri&s;t, entitle its pious po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, to inconcievably greater felicity and honour, in the immortal regions, than even WASHINGTON po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in this world in all his glory. But I would now addre&s;s the mili|tary officers, who a&s;&s;embled in the hou&s;e of mourn|ing,

feel impre&s;&s;ively, in their Country's lo&s;s, a double portion of bereavement.</P>
<P>GENTLEMEN, You have now heard the &s;mall tri|bute paid the memory of the late illu&s;trious Head and Arm of our Republic. Like Sheba's Queen you are ready to &s;ay "The one half hath not been told us." You know better his great worth. There are &s;ome among&s;t you who &s;tood with him in the day of his Country's danger; who beheld him &s;tand as an ho&s;t where danger mo&s;t impended, who imbibed his &s;pirit and learned from him to conquer. You &s;aw him at Trenton and Princeton nobly roll back the &s;welling tide of adver&s;e war&mdash;You &s;aw his many victories, his final triumph, and virtuous retirement to rural &s;cenes. You beheld him twice unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en to fill, with unrivalled dignity and talents, the Pre&s;idential chair. Again he girds his armour on, and you rejoice that under &s;uch a Leader you &s;hall repel the ho&s;tile approaching foe. But you have heard the tidings our Father is no more&mdash;Have witne&s;&s;ed your Country all in tears&mdash;Our temples &s;hrouded in the habiliments of &s;orrow&mdash;and now you wi&s;h to honour the memory of him, who&s;e name ages yet unborn &s;hall long revere. Tran&s;cribe then into your hearts and lives his many virtues. If called to the &s;anguine field combine prudence with valour&mdash;&s;cientific ingenuity with force. In civil life be like him the fir&s;t to yield homage to the laws. In office, civil or military, let integrity, punctuality, and vigilance, characterize like his your every action, maintain inviolably the Federal Con&s;ti|tution. WASHINGTON aided in its con&s;truction and was clad in armour for its defence; it is the for|tre&s;s, in which are depo&s;ited the liberties and inde|pendence of your Country. But above all contem|plate eternity; this only is &s;ub&s;tance, all el&s;e is &s;hadow. What availed it in the moment of mortality to our be|loved pro&s;trate Chief, that a nation &s;hould decree him many honours, that millions &s;hould weep for him, or his name fill the faire&s;t page of hi&s;tory? Nought then availed him but religion. Secure then by faith the favour of him, in who&s;e name alone is &s;alvation; who&s;e death de&s;troyed the power of death: and who&s;e re&s;urrection, proclaims immortality, the por|tion of the ju&s;t.</P>

PERMIT me al&s;o now, to addre&s;s, briefly, the a&s;&s;embly?</P>
<P>FRIENDS, Brethren and Fathers: With our deep regret we &s;hould this day al&s;o combine grateful ac|knowledgements: for, rich has been the di&s;tribution of providential gifts to the&s;e &s;tates. There was a WASHINGTON&mdash;a <HI>Montgomery</HI>&mdash;a <HI>Greene</HI>&mdash;a <HI>Warren</HI>&mdash;and many whom we mu&s;t now omit&mdash;There is &s;till an ADAMS, and others high in office, replete with talents and virtues. The be&s;t expre&s;|&s;ions of our gratitude to God for characters &s;o ine&s;ti|mable; will be to encourage the&s;e his &s;ervants in their &s;everal &s;tations, by our earne&s;t prayers for their pro&s;perity, and by a chearful and ready &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to all their con&s;titutional and lawful appointments.</P>
<P>BUT whil&s;t we pay tribute to illu&s;trious merit found in men, or mourn our fallen chief; let us not forget his bereaved con&s;ort. He was freedom's champion, &s;he at his intimation announces the free|dom of her &s;laves; he endured the toils, anxieties and dangers of eight years warfare, &s;he yielded him up, and &s;ympathi&s;ing partook the whole. He now bath cea&s;ed his labours, but &s;he bereaved feels with indi|vidual force a nation's &s;orrow. Illu&s;trious woman <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> worthy &s;uch an helpmate? Thy &s;ex too have adorn|ed the page of hi&s;tory: even from the fair and pious patrone&s;s of Mo&s;es down to thy favoured &s;elf. Was there a valiant and victorious Barak. There was a great|er Deborah, or was there a beloved John; behold the highly favoured Mary, who gave birth to Me&s;iah, whom highe&s;t orders of arch-angels wor&s;hip. Yes, as in the female under&s;tanding there is often found &s;oil fit for highe&s;t cultivation; So in their &s;en&s;ibility of heart, is a foundation laid whereon may be reared all that is amiable, that is virtuous and worthy of true prai&s;e, and in the approaching kingdom of our heavenly Pa|rent and Redeemer, re&s;pect of per&s;ons &s;hall have no place, nor male nor female, but to the righteous of all generations &s;hall be communicated happine&s;s ineffa|ble through Chri&s;t.</P>
