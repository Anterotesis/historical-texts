<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT TO THE BOSTON EDITION.</HEAD>
<P>TO prevent di&s;ea&s;e by &s;o &s;imple and intel|ligible an expedient, as a due attention to <HI>Diet</HI> and <HI>Regimen,</HI> &s;hould become the mo&s;t univer&s;al as it &s;urely is the mo&s;t rational pur|&s;uit of every man who values health, and is de&s;irous of prolonging life. A judicious book, calculated to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in that pur&s;uit, is therefore entitled to preeminence in every man's library.</P>
<P>Books are not wanting which profe&s;s to teach us how to become our own phy&s;icians, when we are &s;ick:&mdash;Indeed were we to cred|it implicitly the numerous <HI>no&s;trums</HI> and <HI>&s;pe|cifics,</HI> &s;o &s;trongly commended by many writ|ers on medical &s;ubjects, we might almo&s;t ven|ture to que&s;tion the ordinary principle of hu|man infirmity, or man's mortality. Authors of that de&s;cription have given great encour|agement to art, by di&s;countenancing the &s;ug|ge&s;tions of nature; and have furni&s;hed the means of creating di&s;ea&s;es, in&s;tead of a&s;&s;i&s;ting in the purpo&s;e of <HI>cure</HI> or <HI>prevention.</HI> Before the pre&s;ent, no author had expre&s;sly under|taken to in&s;truct mankind in the faculty of &s;hunning di&s;ea&s;e by means &s;o &s;imple as the regulation of Diet. This omi&s;&s;ion has prob|ably been owing to an opinion, that the &s;ub|ject is too trivial and ordinary to authorize.
<PB N="vi" REF="039111_0004_10139E3CD23D0588">
grave di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and that a man mu&s;t fir&s;t be acquainted minutely with the animal func|tions, before he &s;hould hazard an attempt to pre&s;erve them in order, or to rectify their de|rangements. The fallacy of &s;uch an opinion is mo&s;t clearly expo&s;ed in the pre&s;ent produc|tion; and we may here be convinced, that the be&s;t and mo&s;t effectual means of prolong|ing life, and &s;ecuring the ble&s;&s;ings of health, are not only comprehen&s;ible, without the aid of great inve&s;tigation, but practicable with|out the nece&s;&s;ity of great inconvenience or re&s;traint. The rules contained in the pre&s;ent volumes are deduced from the mo&s;t &s;imple and obvious view of the &s;ubject; and al|though they may exhibit nothing very my&s;|terious or ab&s;tru&s;e, we pre&s;ume they are not therefore entitled to le&s;s credit or attention. In the&s;e &s;entiments, we would not be con&s;id|ered to doubt the profundity of the healing art; we only admire the &s;implicity of our author's plan, for rendering the intervention of that art &s;uperfluous and unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>It is true, indeed, the brute creation have no factitious guide to direct them in the per|formance of their animal office; but nature, their only monitor, hath long &s;ince cea&s;ed to be the guide of man. She for&s;ook him when he abandoned her, to pur&s;ue the enjoyments of &s;ociety, on the road of exce&s;s and intem|perance.</P>
<P>In the pre&s;ent highly improved &s;tate of &s;ociety, when the efforts of talents are on the &s;tretch, to di&s;cover new plea&s;ures, new

gratifications, it is not &s;urpri&s;ing that the line of &s;ober enjoyment &s;hould be overlooked.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Much time, learning, and talent has been be&s;towed on the re|&s;earches, made into the cau&s;es of the late epidemic or endemic, or contagious fever, which has for a few years pa&s;t de&s;olated the cap|itals of the United States. Hypothe&s;es were broached, opinions formed, parties rai&s;ed, but no cau&s;e found. What would the Amer|ican faculty think, if, after &s;o many inquiries, this mighty cau&s;e &s;hould be found re&s;olvable in the <HI>vicious diet</HI> and <HI>incautious regimen</HI> peculiar to the Americans? Such are however the grounds of a very judicious treati&s;e, written in French, and &s;ent to the Pre&s;ident of the United States, that he might render it pub|lic. The author, who has re&s;ided &s;everal years in America, paints in &s;trong colours the abu&s;es of <HI>American diet,</HI> compares it minutely with the mode of living of other nations, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who live in the &s;ame latitudes, attributes all the autumnal di&s;ea&s;es of the Americans, and namely their yellow fever, to that cau&s;e; and is &s;urpri&s;ed that it does not produce &s;till greater and more frequent evils, in the capitals of America, where the abu&s;e cannot be ex|ceeded. Nor is the conclu&s;ion ra&s;h, when we find all foreigners, who vi&s;it this country, Frenchmen, Germans, and even Engli&s;hmen, exclaiming again&s;t <HI>our copious</HI> and <HI>everla&s;ting</HI> dinners. Not that fea&s;ts and &s;umptuous entertainments are unknown in Europe, at which the rules of &s;obriety are trampled upon, but they are given on particular occa&s;ions only, whereas the ordinary of an American is an every day fea&s;t. Americans who have travelled abroad, know the truth of this ob&s;ervation. To indulge in a party, where exce&s;s mu&s;t follow, once or twice a month, may hurt us; but to overload the &s;tomach every day, mu&s;t kill us in a very &s;hort time.</NOTE> Cu&s;tom fortifies it&s;elf by appetites; it there|fore requires no &s;mall degree of &s;agacity to di&s;cern, and firmne&s;s to ab&s;tain from tho&s;e ex|ce&s;&s;es, where rea&s;on, already &s;educed by the allurement of new dainties, readily yields to the fa&s;cinating form in which they are pre&s;ent|ed to our &s;en&s;es. If it be an object of magni|tude to correct the pre&s;ent perverted ta&s;te of mankind, and to reve&s;t pain with the power of &s;elf-defence, again&s;t a numerous train of mere artificial maladies, then may we venture to declare, that this work is ju&s;tly entitled to more encomiums than we have faculty

to be&s;tow. Our Author, unlike many others of his profe&s;&s;ion, &s;eems to have been le&s;s de&s;irous to di&s;cover the occult prop|erties of the various articles of &s;u&s;tenance, than to determine their effects, when applied to the human con&s;titution.</P>
<P>It is, moreover, a circum&s;tance, adding not a little to the value and utility of the&s;e volumes, that they are furni&s;hed with a minute and copious index, referring par|ticularly to almo&s;t every &s;ub&s;tance, vege|table or animal, in u&s;e among men, &s;o that the reader may di&s;cover, almo&s;t by a &s;ingle glance, the be&s;t rules by which to control his appetite, and the preci&s;e limits within which the inclination of his &s;en&s;es may be indulged with impunity.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>On the pre&s;ent State of Medicine as a Science.</HEAD>
<P>WE apparently live in an age, when every branch of human knowledge is reduced to a popular &s;y&s;tem; when the mo&s;t important &s;ciences lay a&s;ide the garb of pedantry and my&s;tici&s;m; when, in &s;hort, the &s;ources of information are open to every rank, and to both &s;exes. An improvement, which is &s;o con&s;picuous, mu&s;t ultimately be attend|ed with the mo&s;t de&s;irable and exten&s;ive effects.</P>
<P>Among other beneficial pur&s;uits to render the comforts of life more numerous and per|manent, we have occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve, that Natural Philo&s;ophy and Chemi&s;try contribute a principal &s;hare in &s;preading u&s;eful knowl|edge among all ranks of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>Since Medicine, con&s;idered as a &s;cience, which re&s;ts upon practical rules of experience, is in a great mea&s;ure founded upon Natural Philo&s;ophy and Chemi&s;try, it will be allow|ed that with the daily progre&s;s of the lat|ter, Medicine al&s;o mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily partake
<PB N="2" REF="039111_0032_10139E5F4033C5E8">
of their improvements, and continually re|ceive acce&s;&s;ions conducive to its further per|fection.</P>
<P>With the progre&s;&s;ive increa&s;e of refinement and luxury, a certain weakne&s;s and indi&s;po|&s;ition, whether real or imaginary, has infe&s;t|ed &s;ociety in the character of a gentle epi|demic. It cannot properly be called a di&s;|ea&s;e, but rather an approximation to an in|firm &s;tate, which almo&s;t involuntarily compels man to reflect upon the relative &s;ituation of his phy&s;ical nature, to acquire correct ideas on health, di&s;ea&s;e, and the means of preven|tion or relief, and thus imperceptibly to be|come his own guide.</P>
<P>Every individual of any penetration now claims the privilege of being his own phy&s;ician: It is not unfa&s;hionable to form a <HI>certain</HI> &s;y&s;tem concerning the &s;tate of our own health, and to con&s;ider it as the criterion, by which we may judge of our&s;elves and others, of patients and their phy&s;icians.</P>
<P>Formerly, people were not accu&s;tomed to think of the phy&s;ical &s;tate of their body, until it began to be afflicted with pain or debility: In which ca&s;e, they intru&s;ted it to the practi|tioner in Phy&s;ic, as we deliver a time-piece to a watchmaker, who repairs it according to the be&s;t of his knowledge, without appre|hending, that its owner will be at the trouble of thinking or rea&s;oning upon the method, which he judged to be mo&s;t proper.</P>
<P>In our times, we frequently undertake the charge of pre&s;cribing medicines for our&s;elves:
<PB N="3" REF="039111_0033_10139E231B8CE6F8">
And the natural con&s;equence is, that we &s;el|dom are able to tell, whether we are healthy or di&s;ea&s;ed; that we tru&s;t as much, if not more, to our&s;elves than to the phy&s;ician, who is only &s;ent for occa&s;ionally; and that we cannot conceive him to be perfectly free from the &s;y&s;tems of the &s;chools, from &s;elf-intere&s;t or profe&s;&s;ional motives. Thus, by an ac|quaintance with medical &s;ubjects, which of it|&s;elf is laudable, not only the &s;kill of the phy|&s;ician is frequently thwarted, but the recov|ery of the patient unhappily retarded, or at lea&s;t rendered more difficult.</P>
<P>No di&s;ea&s;e is now cured without demon|&s;tration; and he who can neither di&s;cover nor comply with the peculiar &s;y&s;tem of health adopted by his patient, may indeed act from motives dictated by rea&s;on and humanity; but his &s;ucce&s;s as a <HI>practical phy&s;ician,</HI> in the common acceptation of that phra&s;e, mu&s;t ev|er remain problematical. Yet this general pro|pen&s;ity to inve&s;tigate medical &s;ubjects, if it were properly directed and gratified might be at|tended with very happy effects. For the medical art ought not to be &s;ubject to an im|perious and fa&s;cinating demon, who&s;e labours are chiefly carried on in the dark rece&s;&s;es of my&s;tery, whom we know only from his bane|ful influence, as he &s;pares no objects of prey, and holds his votaries in a perpetual &s;tate of dependence!</P>
<P>"The veil of my&s;tery," &s;ays a modern popular writer, "which &s;till hangs over Med|icine, renders it not only a conjectural, but even a &s;u&s;picious art. This has been long ago
<PB N="4" REF="039111_0034_10139E61D96FF680">
removed from the other &s;ciences, which in|duces many to believe, that Medicine is a mere trick, and that it will not bear a fair and can|did examination. Medicine, however, needs only to be <HI>better</HI> known, in order to &s;ecure the general e&s;teem of mankind. Its precepts are &s;uch as every wi&s;e man would choo&s;e to ob&s;erve, and it forbids nothing but what is incompatible with true happine&s;s."</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Ob&s;ervations on the general Laws of Nature.</HEAD>
<P>IF we reflect upon the admirable uniformi|ty which prevails through the works of na|ture, both in the production and di&s;&s;olution of matter, we find that &s;he invariably moves in a circle; that in the perpetual con&s;truc|tion, as well as in the &s;ub&s;equent demolition of bodies, &s;he is always equally new and equally perfect; that the &s;malle&s;t particle, though invi&s;ible to our eyes, is u&s;efully em|ployed by her re&s;tle&s;s activity; that death it&s;elf, or the de&s;truction of forms and figures, is no more than a careful decompo&s;ition and a de&s;igned regeneration of individual parts, in order to produce new &s;ub&s;tances, in a man|ner no le&s;s &s;kilful than &s;urpri&s;ing. We fur|ther ob&s;erve, that in the immen&s;e variety of things, in the inconceivable wa&s;te of elemen|tary particles, there neverthele&s;s prevails the &s;tricte&s;t economy; that nothing is produced in vain, nothing cou&s;umed without a cau&s;e. We clearly perceive that all nature is united
<PB N="5" REF="039111_0035_10139E24B8723DB8">
by indi&s;&s;oluble ties; that every thing exi&s;ts for the &s;ake of another, and that no one thing can exi&s;t without its neighbour. Hence we ju&s;tly conclude, that man him&s;elf is not an in&s;ulated being, but that he is a nece&s;&s;ary link in the great chain, which connects the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>Nature is our &s;afe&s;t guide, and &s;he will be &s;o with greater certainty, as we become bet|ter acquainted with her operations, e&s;pecially with re&s;pect to tho&s;e particulars which more nearly concern our phy&s;ical exi&s;tence. Thus, a &s;ource of many and exten&s;ive advantages will be opened; thus we &s;hall approach to our original de&s;tination&mdash;namely, that of living long and healthy.</P>
<P>On the contrary, as long as we move in a limited &s;phere of knowledge; as long as we are unconcerned with re&s;pect to the cau&s;es which produce health or di&s;ea&s;e, we are in danger, either of being anxiou&s;ly par&s;imoni|ous, or prodigally profu&s;e of tho&s;e powers, by which life is &s;upported. Both extremes are contrary to the purpo&s;e of nature. She teaches us the rule of ju&s;t economy:&mdash;we, being a &s;mall part of her great &s;y&s;tem, mu&s;t follow her example, and expend neither too much nor too little of her trea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Although it be true that our knowledge of nature is &s;till very imperfect, yet this cir|cum&s;tance ought not to deter us from inve&s;|tigating the means which may lead to its im|provement.</P>
<P>We are a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the experience of &s;o many indu&s;trious inquirers, of &s;o many &s;ound
<PB N="6" REF="039111_0036_10139E646562C530">
philo&s;ophers, that we may flatter our&s;elves with the hopes of di&s;covering &s;ome of her hidden &s;ecrets, and of penetrating &s;till fur|ther into her wonderful rece&s;&s;es. This, how|ever, cannot be accompli&s;hed, without much patience and per&s;everance in the &s;tudent.</P>
<P>All men, it is true, have not &s;ufficient time and opportunities to acquire an accurate and exten&s;ive knowledge of nature; but tho&s;e are inexcu&s;able, who remain entire &s;trang|ers to her ordinary operations, and particu|larly if they neglect to cultivate a proper ac|quaintance with the con&s;titution of their own frame. If, indeed, we were fixed to the earth like the trees by their roots, or if from mere animal in&s;tinct we were &s;timulated to inquire into the cau&s;es of our phy&s;ical life, we then &s;hould vegetate, or live like plants or irrational animals. But, in the character of creatures, who ought to choo&s;e and to reject agreeably to the dictates of rea&s;on, a more a&s;|&s;iduous and minute &s;tudy of nature, as well as of our own frame, is indi&s;pen&s;able; be|cau&s;e the human body cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t, unle&s;s we &s;econd her intentions and co-operate with her beneficent efforts.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Difference of Opinions on Medical Subjects.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not unfrequently objected, that Med|icine it&s;elf is an uncertain, fluctuating, and precarious art. One medical &s;chool, for in|&s;tance, con&s;iders the ma&s;s of the fluids as the
<PB N="7" REF="039111_0037_10139E286E38AFF8">
primary cau&s;e of all di&s;ea&s;es; another a&s;|cribes them to the irregular action of the &s;ol|ids, and particularly the nerves; &s;ome again con&s;ider that as the cau&s;e of the di&s;order, which many are inclined to repre&s;ent as the effect. Thus, different &s;chools propagate dif|ferent tenets relative to the origin of di&s;|ea&s;es; though ultimately, with re&s;pect to mat|ters of fact, they mu&s;t all nece&s;&s;arily agree. Nor is this diver&s;ity of opinions in the lea&s;t degree detrimental to the practical depart|ment of Medicine; provided that we do not regulate the mode of treatment altogether by hypothetical notions. Of what con&s;e|quence is it to the patient, whether his phy|&s;ician imagines the nerves to be fine tubes, filled with a &s;ubtle fluid, or not? whether he believes that catarrhs ari&s;e from noxious particles floating in the air, or from catching cold?&mdash;or whether he is prejudiced in favour of this or that particular theory of fevers?&mdash;It is a &s;ufficient &s;ecurity to the patient, if his phy&s;ician be thoroughly acquainted with the &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e, and be able to di&s;|tingui&s;h them from tho&s;e of any other mal|ady. In this re&s;pect, the medical art is truly excellent, and without a rival; for the na|ture of di&s;ea&s;es remains invariably the &s;ame. The accurate ob&s;ervations made by Hippoc|rates, two thou&s;and years ago, on the pro|gre&s;s and &s;ymptoms of di&s;ea&s;es, recur to the medical practitioner of the pre&s;ent day, in a manner &s;ufficiently regular and uniform.&mdash;And, in fact, how &s;hould it be otherwi&s;e; when nature always pur&s;ues the &s;ame path,

whether in a healty or di&s;ea&s;ed &s;tate of the body?</P>
<P>Here again it will be a&s;ked, whence does it happen that two phy&s;icians &s;eldom agree in opinion, with regard to the ca&s;e of the &s;ame patient? This que&s;tion may be briefly an&s;wered, by claiming the &s;ame right for the medical profe&s;&s;ion, which is a&s;&s;umed by theo|logians in conte&s;ted points of divinity; by lawyers in arguing any part of their code, which is not perfectly plain; and by philo&s;|ophers who maintain different opinions on the &s;ame &s;ubject in metaphy&s;ics; for in&s;tance, that of <HI>&s;pace</HI> and <HI>time.</HI> But there are more forcible rea&s;ons which enable us, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to account for this diver&s;ity of opin|ions in Medicine. One of the phy&s;icians, perhaps, is in the habit of vi&s;iting fifty pa|tients in a forenoon, &s;o that he has not &s;uf|ficient time to inve&s;tigate minutely the na|ture and origin of the di&s;ea&s;e; while anoth|er of le&s;s exten&s;ive practice is enabled to do more ju&s;tice to his patients, by attending to their complaints with proper lei&s;ure and ac|curacy. One of them &s;hall di&s;tingui&s;h &s;ome of the leading &s;ymptoms, and without he&s;i|tation pronounce, that he has di&s;covered the true &s;eat of the malady; but as many di&s;ea&s;|es of a different nature are attended with &s;im|ilar and common &s;ymptoms, there is no &s;mall danger of confounding the one with the oth|er. Another &s;hall enter the patient's room with a pre-conceived opinion on the &s;ubject of &s;ome prevailing epidemic, or with his head probably full of the ca&s;e which occupied his

attention in the la&s;t vi&s;it. With the&s;e im|pediments, how difficult will it be to in&s;titute a cool and unbia&s;&s;ed inquiry? If, again, both &s;hould happen to be called in at different &s;tages of the di&s;order, each of them would pre|&s;cribe a different method of cure, and the judgment of him who was la&s;t con&s;ulted, would in all probability be the mo&s;t correct. Or la&s;tly, a phy&s;ician may be &s;ent for, who, having commenced his &s;tudies about the mid|dle of this century, has not (from want of time or inclination) &s;ufficiently attended to the more recent di&s;coveries of this inqui&s;itive age; how can it then be expected, that he &s;hould agree in opinion with tho&s;e, who&s;e knowledge has been improved by the num|berle&s;s new facts and ob&s;ervations lately made in phy&s;ics, particularly in Chemi&s;try?</P>

Few traces of this beneficial in&s;tinct can be di&s;covered in

the human race. Our own experience, or the in&s;tructions of others, which are likewi&s;e founded upon experience, mu&s;t gradually teach us the whole&s;ome or pernicious quali|ties of the objects of the material world.&mdash;Rea&s;on, indeed, that peculir faculty of man, indemnifies him, in a great mea&s;ure, for the want of this in&s;tinct; it directs his choice in pur&s;uing what is u&s;eful, and in avoiding what is injurious. Yet at the &s;ame time, the want of in&s;tinct in man, is the &s;ource of ma|ny &s;ufferings in the earlier years of his life.&mdash;He is born without covering, to with&s;tand the effects of climate; without arms, to de|fend him&s;elf in his helple&s;s &s;tate, and without in&s;tinct, if we except that of &s;ucking. He remains much longer incapable of providing, for his &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, and &s;tands in need of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his parents for a much greater number of years, than any other an|imal with which we are acquainted. Al|though his parents, in general, acquit them|&s;elves of this charge with much greater &s;o|licitude and tenderne&s;s than the lower ani|mals, yet our imperfect in&s;tinct is productive of much mi&s;chief to children, from ignorance and ill directed tenderne&s;s in parents and nur&s;es. Children are frequently furni&s;hed with articles of food and dre&s;s which, at a more advanced age, nouri&s;h the &s;eeds of di&s;|ea&s;e and di&s;&s;olution. Thus, many infants are indebted for their ob&s;tructions in the me&s;en|tery, and the con&s;umptive habit attending them, to their uninformed and over anxious parents or friends, who commit daily errors

with regard to the quantity and quality of the aliment, which in many in&s;tances they &s;o liberally admini&s;ter to the objects of their care; even though it be of an indige&s;tible nature.</P>
<P>In the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place, it is a fact univer&s;ally admitted, that mankind, e&s;pecially in large and populous towns, have much degenerated in bodily &s;trength, energy of mind, and in their capacity of re&s;i&s;ting the noxious agency of powers which affect them from without.</P>
<P>The progre&s;&s;ive cultivation of the mind, together with the daily refinements of habits and manners, are ever accompanied with a proportionate increa&s;e of luxury. But as this change, from a robu&s;t to a more relaxed &s;tate of life, has produced no difference in the <HI>cau&s;es</HI> generating di&s;ea&s;e, to which we are even more &s;ubject than formerly, we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;uffer by the concomitant <HI>effects.</HI> For though luxury has a&s;&s;i&s;ted us in prevent|ing the temporary effects of external agents, &s;uch as cold, heat, rain, &amp;c. and we can oc|ca&s;ionally guard our&s;elves again&s;t their &s;ever|ity, we are, upon the next return of them, attacked with much greater violence, than if we had been more habituated to their influ|ence. And this &s;tate of things has imper|ceptibly introduced the u&s;e of many articles, both of dre&s;s and aliment, which in their con&s;equences often prove detrimental to health. Hence we find, that in proportion as the refinements of luxury increa&s;e in a na|tion, the number and variety of di&s;ea&s;es al&s;o
<PB N="12" REF="039111_0042_10139E6C5D3B0840">
increa&s;e. On the contrary, the more unciv|ilized a people continue, and the more their habits and cu&s;toms approximate to a &s;tate of nature, the le&s;s are they affected by the cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>In the <HI>third</HI> place, we ob&s;erve among the human race a greater number of prevailing pa&s;&s;ions, and man is more violently, and, for the time of their duration, more ob&s;tinately governed by them, than any other living creature. The&s;e emotions variou&s;ly affect the human body. But the mo&s;t noxious and oppre&s;&s;ive than any other of all the pa&s;&s;ions, are <HI>terror</HI> and <HI>grief:</HI> The former of which is &s;ometimes &s;o violent as to threaten immedi|ate de&s;truction. Controlled by their power|ful influence, and hurried away by the im|pul&s;e of the moment, the mind is rendered incapable of judging, and of properly &s;elect|ing the means of allaying tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions.&mdash;Hence the remedies, to which we have re|cour&s;e during the prevalence of pa&s;&s;ion, and which then appear to us the mo&s;t proper, frequently lay the foundation of innumera|ble di&s;orders, both of body and mind.</P>
<P>A <HI>fourth</HI> &s;ource of di&s;ea&s;es among mankind, are various &s;pecific contagions; and perhaps the greater number of the&s;e originate in the atmo&s;phere which &s;urrounds us.

we daily ob&s;erve their migrations; we perceive them moving from one individual to another, without fixing any &s;tationary re&s;|idence: Yet they have hitherto fru&s;trated ev|ery attempt made towards their extirpation. Of this un&s;ettled nature are, the &s;mall pox, the mea&s;les, the hooping cough, the influen|za, and many other epidemics. The fir&s;t of them, namely the &s;mall pox, has of late years been very &s;ucce&s;sfully treated; and it is well known that &s;ome of the mo&s;t ingenious practitioners in Italy and Germany are, at this moment, employed in a &s;erious attempt, wholly to extirpate this contagion from the Continent of Europe; an object which has formerly been accompli&s;hed in the ca&s;es of the plague and lepro&s;y.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The means employed by our ance&s;tors, in &s;ubduing the viru|lence of the&s;e malignant di&s;orders, con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in &s;eparating ev|ery infected per&s;on from the healthy, and preventing all intercour&s;e between them. For this purpo&s;e, many thou&s;and hou&s;es of recep|tion were then e&s;tabli&s;hed and &s;upported at the public expen&s;e, in every country of Europe; the di&s;ea&s;ed were in&s;tantly and carefully removed to tho&s;e hou&s;es, and not permitted to leave them till per|fectly cured. A mea&s;ure &s;omewhat &s;imilar to this has lately been propo&s;ed, and laid before the Plenipotentiaries of the Continental Powers a&s;&s;embled at Ra&s;tadt, by Profe&s;&s;or Junker, Dr. Fau&s;t, and other German Phy&s;icians. This propo&s;al, however, differs e&s;&s;en|tially from the former method of extirpating contagious di&s;orders: as, according to the modern plan, we under&s;tand every individual, whether willing or not, mu&s;t &s;ubmit to be inoculated for the &s;mall-pox.</P>
<P>To deprive this loath&s;ome di&s;ea&s;e of its de&s;tructive power, ano|ther method, perhaps more plau&s;ible and le&s;s compul&s;ory, has been lately attempted in this country, and &s;trongly recommended by Drs.

I allude to the inoculation for the <HI>cow-pox.</HI> It is &s;incerely to be wi&s;hed, that their humane efforts may be crowned with &s;ucce&s;s: and if it be true that per&s;ons inoculated for the cow-pox are <HI>forever</HI> ex|empt from the infection of the <HI>&s;mall-pox,</HI> and that this artificial tran&s;lation of morbid matter from the brute to the human &s;ubject is not attended with danger, it is of little con&s;equence whether the cow-pox originate from any cutaneous di&s;ea&s;e of the milker, or from the grea&s;e of hor&s;es.

<HEAD>On the Doctrine of Temperaments.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE it is e&s;tabli&s;hed by numberle&s;s facts, that the temperaments, as well as the di&s;|ea&s;es, of whole nations, are in a great mea&s;|ure influenced by their ordinary articles of food, it will no longer be doubted, that the mo&s;t important con&s;equences re&s;ult from our aliment, whether of food or drink.</P>
<P>As the <HI>doctrine of temperaments</HI> is in it&s;elf highly curious and intere&s;ting, I think this a proper place for introducing &s;ome practi|cal remarks, tending to illu&s;trate that &s;ub|ject, and pre&s;enting a conci&s;e view of it, chiefly derived from the learned annotations of the celebrated Profe&s;&s;or S&ouml;mmering of Mayence.</P>
<P>"The doctrine of temperaments," &s;ays he, "in the general acceptation of that term, mu&s;t be allowed to have greatly mi&s;led the ancient phy&s;icians, and particularly tho&s;e who lived before the time of <HI>Galen.</HI> We are not, however, to infer from this, that
<PB N="15" REF="039111_0045_10139E32F4F6A3B8">
the doctrine it&s;elf is without foundation.&mdash;They erred not, by admitting the exi&s;tence of temperaments; for that &s;eems now to be fully e&s;tabli&s;hed; but by too great a fond|ne&s;s for <HI>generalization;</HI> by limiting the num|ber of them to <HI>four,</HI> and fixing their atten|tion in this divi&s;ion &s;imply on the nature and compo&s;ition of the blood, in&s;tead of re|garding the whole animal economy. Thus, for in&s;tance, they knew many parts of the human body &s;carcely by their names, and were little, if at all, acquainted with the great influence of the nerves; while our modern phy&s;icians pay an almo&s;t extravagant homage to the&s;e fa&s;hionable co-operators in di&s;ea&s;es, and frequently forget, in their attention to their favourites, the more important, at lea&s;t more obvious, parts of the fluids.</P>
<P>"There is a certain line ob&s;ervable in all the more perfect animals, by which nature is regulated in performing the functions of body and mind; in pre&s;erving or impair|ing the health, and in exerting all tho&s;e en|ergies of life, on which the happine&s;s of the creature depends. This line is various in different individuals, and the variety cannot be completely explained on the principle of the ancients, by a difference in the qualities of the blood alone; though a human body of moderate &s;ize contains not le&s;s than thir|ty pounds weight of that fluid. Other terms mu&s;t therefore be &s;ub&s;tituted for their <HI>&s;an|guine, choleric, phlegmatic,</HI> and <HI>melancholy</HI> tem|peraments; but before we attempt them, it
<PB N="16" REF="039111_0046_10139E717A3A6EE0">
will be nece&s;&s;ary to take a more exten&s;ive view of the economy of man.</P>
<P>"The cau&s;es of the difference of temper|aments are various: <HI>Fir&s;t;</HI> a difference in the nervous &s;y&s;tem, with re&s;pect to the num|ber of the nervous fibres, their &s;trength, and &s;en&s;ibility. A large brain, coar&s;e and &s;trong nerves, and great general &s;en&s;ibility, have always been found to be the marks of a <HI>choleric</HI> or <HI>cholerico-&s;anguine</HI> di&s;po&s;ition. Hence proceeds the quickne&s;s of perception and capacity of knowledge in per&s;ons of this cla&s;s, accompanied with great acutene&s;s and &s;trength of judgment, from the multitude of their ideas of compari&s;on. The&s;e quali|ties are, however, in &s;ome mea&s;ure counter|balanced by a violent propen&s;ity to anger, and impatience under &s;light &s;ufferings of body or mind. Medicines ought, therefore, to be cautiou&s;ly admini&s;tered to them, and in &s;mall quantities only. A diminutive brain and very delicate nerves have generally been ob&s;erved to be connected with dull &s;en&s;es, and a phlegmatic languor&mdash;&s;ometimes with a taint of melancholy. To affect the organs of &s;uch per&s;ons, the impre&s;&s;ion of external objects mu&s;t be &s;trong and permanent. Their judgments are often childi&s;h from the want of ideas, and hence they are &s;eldom able to make great progre&s;s in &s;cience. They are, however, more fit to endure labour, and the injuries of climate; con&s;equently their med|icines &s;hould be &s;trong, and admini&s;tered in large quantities.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="039111_0047_10139E3577E72840">
"<HI>Secondly:</HI> Difference of irritability is another cau&s;e of difference of temperament. When the fibres are excited by the &s;lighte&s;t &s;timulus to quick and permanent contrac|tion, we may ju&s;tly infer the exi&s;tence of a choleric di&s;po&s;ition; while a phlegmatic tem|per di&s;plays it&s;elf by oppo&s;ite &s;ymptoms; the mu&s;cles being &s;lowly contracted, and excit|ed with difficulty by the mo&s;t powerful &s;tim|ulus.</P>
<P>"<HI>Thirdly:</HI> The fibres and membranes of a phlegmatic per&s;on are remarkably &s;oft to the touch; tho&s;e of a melancholic per&s;on hard and dry, with greater tone and facility of contraction.</P>
<P>"<HI>Fourthly:</HI> There appears to be &s;ufficient rea&s;on for the opinion, that an <HI>electric</HI> prin|ciple is di&s;per&s;ed through the atmo&s;phere, which is communicated to the body, in dif|ferent degrees, by re&s;piration; which &s;up|plies the fibres with their natural tone; gives a more lively motion to the ve&s;&s;els; and increa&s;es the &s;erenity of the mind. This principle does not exi&s;t in the atmo&s;phere in equal quantities in all countries, nor even in the &s;ame country at different &s;ea&s;ons or hours of the day. Thus, during the influ|ence of the <HI>Sirocco</HI> in <HI>Sicily,</HI> all the fibres are oppre&s;&s;ed by languor; but when the air be|comes more &s;erene and ela&s;tic, the natural energy of body and mind returns. All men do not in&s;pire this electric matter in equal quantities, and thus a remarkable difference of temperament is produced.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="039111_0048_10139E7411B0B790">
"<HI>Fifthly:</HI> To the&s;e cau&s;es mu&s;t be added the different nature and quantity of the blood. Thus, when the blood is highly &s;timulant, the heart is excited to more vio|lent action; an increa&s;ed &s;ecretion of bile promotes the vermicular motion, and a &s;u|perfluity of mucus di&s;po&s;es to catarrh, &amp;c. From the&s;e con&s;iderations it is evident, that there are cau&s;es &s;ufficiently powerful to pro|duce, at a very early period of life, an unal|terable predi&s;po&s;ition to a certain tempera|ment. That a complete change is ever ef|fected, from a choleric habit, for in&s;tance, to a phlegmatic, cannot be con&s;i&s;tently ad|mitted, at lea&s;t while the laws of nature re|main unalterable. I will, however, admit that the temperaments, though not com|pletely changed, may be modified;&mdash;that the vehemence of &s;ome, and the languor of others, may to a certain degree be le&s;&s;ened; but this mu&s;t be done by remedies &s;uited to the cla&s;s of the cau&s;es productive of a partic|ular temperament. Of the&s;e the principal are:</P>
<P N="1">1. A different regimen. Thus animal food imparts the highe&s;t degree of &s;trength to the organs, enlivens the &s;en&s;es, and often occa&s;ions a degree of ferocity; as is evident in cannibals, in carnivorous animals in gen|eral, in butchers and their dogs, in hunters, particularly when aided by the frequent u&s;e of &s;pices, wines, and &s;timulating medicines. Vegetable diet, on the contrary, dimini&s;hes the irritability and &s;en&s;ibility of the &s;y&s;tem;
<PB N="19" REF="039111_0049_10139EB622E90300">
in a word, renders it phlegmatic.&mdash;Some authors indeed have con&s;idered potatoes as being the means of contributing to that end; but I am not inclined to &s;ub&s;cribe to this doctrine; &s;ince I have had occa&s;ion to ob|&s;erve the lively temperament of the common people in Ireland.&mdash;Yet attention to this is highly nece&s;&s;ary in tho&s;e, who have the charge of children; as by the u&s;e of animal food, additional energy may be given to the fibres, and when their irritability is too great, it may be dimini&s;hed by an oppo&s;ite regimen.</P>
<P N="2">"2. Education, both phy&s;ical and moral, is another cau&s;e of alteration in the temper|ament of man. Its power is almo&s;t un|bounded, e&s;pecially in the more early peri|ods of life; and hence it often happens, that whole nations &s;eem to po&s;&s;e&s;s one com|mon temperament.</P>
<P N="3">"3. Climate, in its mo&s;t exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e, comprehending atmo&s;phere and &s;oil, is a third cau&s;e of alteration. The activity and acutene&s;s of a choleric habit are &s;eldom to be found in a region of perpetual fog; as for in&s;tance, in Holland. They are the natural produce of a warm climate, and require a gentle elevation of &s;urface, with a moderately moi&s;t &s;oil, and a &s;erene, equal atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P N="4">"4. I have often ob&s;erved an a&s;toni&s;hing degree of activity communicated to the whole &s;y&s;tem, by an ardent de&s;ire of learn|ing; &s;o that the temperament &s;eemed to re|ceive new life from every acce&s;&s;ion of knowl|edge.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="20" REF="039111_0050_10139E77A9760768">
"5. The want of the nece&s;&s;aries of life, on the one hand, or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the means of luxury on the other, variou&s;ly modify the di&s;po&s;ition;&mdash;and the liveline&s;s of the temperament is al&s;o ob&s;erved to ri&s;e or fall, according to the degree of political freedom.</P>
<P N="6">"6. Age, company, and profe&s;&s;ional du|ties greatly affect the temperament. Hence we &s;eldom find any one who, at 56 years of age, retains the activity of that choleric or &s;anguine habit which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at 36.</P>
<P>"Tho&s;e who follow nature, and not a plau&s;ible hypothe&s;is, will be &s;en&s;ible how dif|ficult it is to cla&s;&s;ify and fix the characteri&s;tic marks of the different temperaments; and it is rather a matter of doubt, whether the following rude &s;ketch will be more &s;ucce&s;s|ful than the attempts of others.</P>
<P>"All the modifications of temperaments appear to be varieties of the <HI>&s;anguine</HI> and <HI>phlegmatic.</HI></P>
<P N="1">"1. The &s;anguine is variable. It is mark|ed by a lively complexion; the ve&s;&s;els are full of blood; and per&s;ons of this habit are &s;eldom able to bear great warmth; they are predi&s;po&s;ed to inflammations, and po&s;&s;e&s;s a high degree of irritability and &s;en&s;ibili|ty. All is voluptuous in this temperament. They are &s;ickle in every thing they under|take; are affable, and &s;oon become acquaint|ed, but as &s;oon forget their friends, and are &s;u&s;picious of every body. Whatever re|quires indu&s;try they abhor, and hence make little progre&s;s in &s;cience, till they advance in age.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="21" REF="039111_0051_10139EB8B269F1E0">
"2. The &s;anguineo-choleric enjoys all the health and &s;erenity of the &s;anguine, with all the per&s;everance of the choleric.</P>
<P N="3">"3. In the choleric, the body is &s;oft and flexible, without being dry and meagre as in the melancholic; the &s;kin has a teint of yel|low; the hair is red; the eyes dark and moderately large, with a penetrating expre&s;|&s;ion, and frequently a degree of wildne&s;s; the pul&s;e full and quick; the mu&s;cular con|tractions in walking, &s;peaking, &amp;c. are rapid; the bile is copious and acrid, and hence the vermicular motion is active, and the body not liable to co&s;tivene&s;s. Per&s;ons of this cla&s;s are particularly fond of animal food. They po&s;&s;e&s;s great magnanimity, are fitted for laborious undertakings, and &s;eem born to command.</P>
<P N="4">"4. He who&s;e temperament is hypochon|driacal, is a burthen to him&s;elf and others. Per&s;ons of this cla&s;s are &s;ubject to di&s;ea&s;es of the liver, and hence have a &s;allow complex|ion. They are never content with their &s;it|uation, and are a prey to envy and &s;u&s;|picion.</P>
<P N="5">"5. The melancholic temperament is marked by a gloomy countenance, &s;mall, hol|low, blinking eyes, black hair, a rigid or tough &s;kin, dry and meagre fibres. The pul&s;e is weak and languid, the bile black, the vermicular motion &s;low. The percep|tions of per&s;ons of this di&s;po&s;ition are quick; they are fond of contemplation, and are &s;low in the execution of labour, which they pa|tiently undertake. They bear with re&s;olu|tion

<P N="6">"6. The <HI>Boeotic</HI> or ru&s;tic temperament has many of the qualities of the &s;anguine, in common with many of tho&s;e of the phleg|matic. The body is brawny, the mu&s;cles have but little irritability, the nerves are dull, the manners rude, and the powers of apprehen&s;ion weak.</P>
<P N="7">"7. The gentle temperament is a combi|nation of the &s;anguine, choleric, and phleg|matic. Univer&s;al benevolence is the di&s;tin|gui&s;hing character of this cla&s;s.

<P N="8">"8. The phlegmatic cla&s;s is marked by a &s;oft, white &s;kin, prominent eyes, a weak pul&s;e, and languid gait. They &s;peak &s;lowly, are little hurt by the injuries of the weather, &s;ubmit to oppre&s;&s;ion, and &s;eem born to obey.

<P>ALTHOUGH there is but one &s;tate of perfect health, yet the deviations from it, and the genera and &s;pecies of di&s;ea&s;es, are almo&s;t in|finite. It will hence, without difficulty, be under&s;tood, that in the cla&s;&s;es of medical re|medies
<PB N="23" REF="039111_0053_10139EBA37185EC0">
there mu&s;t likewi&s;e be a great varie|ty, and that &s;ome of them are even of oppo|&s;ite tendencies. Such are both the warm and the cold bath, con&s;idered as medical remedies. Though oppo&s;ite to each other in their &s;en&s;ible effects, each of them mani|fe&s;ts its medical virtue, yet only in &s;uch a &s;tate of the body as will admit of u&s;ing it with advantage.</P>
<P>It is evident from the&s;e premi&s;es, that an univer&s;al remedy, or one that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es heal|ing powers for the cure of <HI>all</HI> di&s;ea&s;es, is in fact a nonentity, the exi&s;tence of which is phy&s;ically impo&s;&s;ible, as the mere idea of it involves a direct contradiction. How, for in&s;tance, can it be conceived, that the &s;ame remedy &s;hould be capable of re&s;toring the tone of the fibres, when they are relaxed, and al&s;o have the power of relaxing them when they are too rigid; that it &s;hould coagulate the fluids when in a &s;tate of re|&s;olution, and again attenuate them when they are too vi&s;cid; that it &s;hould moderate the nerves in a &s;tate of preternatural &s;en&s;ibil|ity, and likewi&s;e re&s;tore to them their prop|er degree of irritability, when they are in a contrary &s;tate.</P>
<P>Indeed, the belief in an univer&s;al remedy appears to lo&s;e ground every day, even among the vulgar, and has been long ex|ploded in tho&s;e cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety, which are not influenced by prejudice, or tinctured with fanatici&s;m. It is, however, &s;incerely to be regretted, that we are &s;till inundated
<PB N="24" REF="039111_0054_10139E7BC84733A0">
with a flood of adverti&s;ments in almo&s;t ev|ery new&s;paper; that the lower and le&s;s en|lightened cla&s;&s;es of the community are &s;till impo&s;ed upon by a &s;et of privileged impo&s;|tors, who frequently puzzle the intelligent reader to decide, whether the boldne&s;s or the indu&s;try with which they endeavour to e&s;tabli&s;h the reputation of their re&s;pective poi&s;ons, be the mo&s;t prominent feature in their character.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>To illu&s;trate this propo&s;ition farther, I &s;hall quote the &s;en&s;ible remarks of a late writer, Mr. JAMES PARKINSON, who expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf, in his "<HI>Medical Admonitions,</HI>" when treating on the &s;ubject of Catarrh, in the following pertinent words:</P>
<P>"Mo&s;t of the No&s;trums adverti&s;ed as <HI>cough drops,</HI> &amp;c. are prepa|rations of opium, &s;imilar to the paregoric elixir of the &s;hops, but di&s;gui&s;ed and rendered more deleterious, by the addition of aro|matic and heating gums. The injury which may be occa&s;ioned by the indi&s;criminate employment of &s;uch medicines, in this di&s;ea&s;e, may be very con&s;iderable; as is well known by every per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing even the &s;malle&s;t &s;hare of medical knowledge.</P>
<P>"It would undoubtedly be rendering a great benefit to &s;ociety, if &s;ome medical man were to convince the ignorant of the pernicious con|&s;equences of their reliance on adverti&s;ed No&s;trums: but, unfortu|nately, the &s;ituation in which medical men &s;tand is &s;uch, that their be&s;t-intentioned and mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted exertions for this purpo&s;e would not only be but little regarded, but frequently would be even imputed to ba&s;e and invidious motives. Tho&s;e to whom they have to addre&s;s their admonitions are unhappily tho&s;e on whom rea&s;on has lea&s;t influence. "Prithee, Doctor," &s;aid an old acquaintance to a celebrated empiric, who was &s;tanding at his door, "how is it that you, who&s;e origin I &s;o well know, &s;hould have been able to obtain more patients than almo&s;t all the regular-bred phy&s;icians?"&mdash;"Pray," &s;ays the Quack, "how many per&s;ons may have pa&s;&s;ed us whil&s;t you put your que&s;tion?"&mdash;"About twenty."&mdash;"And, pray, how many of tho&s;e do you &s;uppo&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a competent &s;hare of common &s;en&s;e?"&mdash;"Perhaps one out of twenty."&mdash;"Ju&s;t &s;o," &s;ays the Doctor; "and that one applies to the regular phy&s;ician, whil&s;t I and my brethren pick up the other nineteen."&mdash;P. 327 and 328.</P></NOTE>&mdash;It was ju&s;tly ob&s;erved by the &s;agacious and comprehen&s;ive Bacon, "that a reflecting phy&s;ician is not directed
<PB N="25" REF="039111_0055_10139EBCE8FBF568">
by the opinion which the multitude entertain of a favourite remedy; but that he mu&s;t be guided by a &s;ound judgment; and con&s;e|quently he is led to make very important di&s;tinctions between tho&s;e things, which only by their name pa&s;s for medical remedies, and others which in reality po&s;&s;e&s;s healing pow|ers."</P>
<P>I am induced to avail my&s;elf of this quota|tion, as it indirectly cen&s;ures the conduct of <HI>certain</HI> medical practitioners, who do not &s;cru|ple to recommend what are vulgarly called Patent and other Quack medicines, <HI>the compo|&s;ition of which is carefully concealed from the pub|lic.</HI> Having acquired their ill-merited repu|tation by mere chance, and being &s;upported by the mo&s;t refined artifices, in order to de|lude the unwary, we are unable to come at the evidence of perhaps nine-tenths of tho&s;e who have experienced their fatal effects, and who are now no longer in a &s;ituation to com|plain.</P>
<P>The tran&s;ition from <HI>Panaceas,</HI> or univer&s;al remedies, to <HI>No&s;trums</HI> or <HI>Specifics,</HI> &s;uch, for in|&s;tance, as pretend to cure the <HI>&s;ame</HI> di&s;ea&s;e in <HI>every</HI> patient, is ea&s;y and natural. With the latter al&s;o, impo&s;itions of a dangerous tenden|cy are often practi&s;ed. It will probably be a&s;ked here, how far they are practically ad|mi&s;&s;ible, and in what ca&s;es they are wholly unavailing. It is not very difficult to an&s;wer this que&s;tion. In tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, which in ev|ery in&s;tance depend upon the &s;ame cau&s;e, at in agues, the &s;mall-pox, mea&s;les, and many other contagious di&s;tempers, the po&s;&s;ibility of
<PB N="26" REF="039111_0056_10139E7E539BDA08">
&s;pecifics, in a limited &s;en&s;e, may be rationally, though <HI>hypothetically,</HI> admitted. But in other maladies, the cau&s;es of which depend upon a variety of concurrent circum&s;tances, and the cure of which, in different individuals, fre|quently requires very oppo&s;ite remedies, as in the Drop&s;y, the various &s;pecies of Colic, the almo&s;t infinite variety of Con&s;umptions, &amp;c. &amp;c. a &s;pecific remedy is an impudent burle&s;que upon the common &s;en&s;e of mankind. Tho&s;e who are but imperfectly acquainted with the various cau&s;es from which the &s;ame di&s;order originates in different individuals, can never entertain &s;uch a vulgar and dan|gerous notion. They will ea&s;ily perceive, how much depends upon a&s;certaining with preci&s;ion the &s;eat and cau&s;e of the affection, before any medicine can be pre&s;cribed with advantage of &s;afety:&mdash;even life and death, I am concerned to &s;ay, are too often decided by the <HI>fir&s;t &s;teps</HI> of him, who offers or intrudes his advice upon a &s;uffering friend.</P>
<P>The following in&s;tances will &s;hew the dan|ger attending the precipitate application of the &s;ame medicine in &s;imilar di&s;orders.&mdash;A per&s;on violently troubled with the colic took a gla&s;s of juniper &s;pirits, commonly called Hollands, from which he received almo&s;t in|&s;tantaneous relief, as the affection proceeded from flatulency. Another per&s;on, who found him&s;elf attacked with &s;imilar pains, was in|duced by the example of his friend to try the &s;ame expedient; he took it without he&s;ita|tion, and died in a few hours after.&mdash;No wonder that the con&s;equences here were fatal,
<PB N="27" REF="039111_0057_10139EC06D4F1348">
as the colic in the latter ca&s;e was owing to an inflammation in the inte&s;tines.&mdash;A third per&s;on was afflicted with a colic, ari&s;ing from poi&s;onous mu&s;hrooms, which he had inad|vertently &s;wallowed; the immediate admin|i&s;tration of an emetic, and after it, &s;ome di|luted vegetable acid, re&s;tored him to health. A fourth per&s;on had an attack of this malady from an <HI>ency&s;ted hernia</HI> or inward rupture. The emetic, which relieved the former pa|tient, nece&s;&s;arily proved fatal to the latter; for it bur&s;t the bag of inclo&s;ed matter, pour|ed the contents within the cavities of the ab|domen, and thus &s;peedily terminated his exi&s;t|ence. Again, another had by mi&s;take made u&s;e of ar&s;enic, which occa&s;ioned violent pains, not unlike tho&s;e of a common colic. A large quantity of &s;weet oil taken internally was the means of his pre&s;ervation; whereas the rem|edies employed in the other ca&s;es would have been totally ineffectual. Here I willingly clo&s;e a narrative, the recital of which cannot but excite the mo&s;t painful &s;en&s;ations. To lengthen the illu&s;tration would lead me too far beyond my pre&s;cribed limits: for ca&s;es of this nature happen &s;o frequently, that it would be ea&s;y to extend the account of them, by a long catalogue of intere&s;ting but fatal acci|dents.</P>
<P>What is more natural than to place confi|dence in a remedy, which we have known to afford relief to others in the &s;ame kind of af|fection? The patient anxiou&s;ly inquires after a per&s;on who has been afflicted with the &s;ame malady. He is eager to learn the remedy

that has been u&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s. His friend or neighbour imparts to him the wi&s;hed-for intelligence. He is determined to give it a fair trial, and takes it with confidence. From what has been &s;tated, it will not be difficult to conceive, that if his ca&s;e does not exactly corre&s;pond with that of his friend, any <HI>chance remedy</HI> may be extremely dangerous, and even fatal.</P>
<P>The phy&s;ician is obliged to employ all his &s;agacity, &s;upported by his own experience, as well as by that of his predece&s;&s;ors; and, neverthele&s;s, is often under the temporary nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;covering from the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e, what he could not derive from the minute&s;t re&s;earches. How then can it be expected, that a novice in the art of healing &s;hould be more &s;ucce&s;sful, when the whole of his method of cure is either the impul&s;e of the moment, or the effect of his own credu|lity? It may be therefore truly &s;aid, that life and death are frequently intru&s;ted to chance.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The late Dr. HUXHAM, a phy&s;ician of great celebrity, in &s;peak|ing of <HI>A&s;clepiades,</HI> the Roman empiric, &s;ays: "This man from a <HI>de|claimer</HI> turned <HI>phy&s;ician,</HI> and &s;et him&s;elf up to oppo&s;e all the phy&s;icians of his time; and the novelty of the thing bore him out, as it fre|quently doth the <HI>Quacks</HI> of the pre&s;ent time; and ever will, <HI>whil&s;t the majority of the world are fools.</HI>"</P>
<P>In another place, Dr. Huxham thus curiou&s;ly contra&s;ts the too timid practice of &s;ome regular phy&s;icians, with the hazardous treat|ment, which is the leading feature of Quacks; "The timid, low, in|&s;ipid practice of &s;ome, is almo&s;t as dangerous as the bold, unwarranted empirici&s;m of others; time and opportunity, never to be regained, are often lo&s;t by the former; whil&s;t the latter, by a <HI>bold pu&s;h,</HI> &s;ends you off the <HI>&s;tage</HI> in a moment."</P></NOTE></P>
<P>From what has been premi&s;ed, it may be confidently a&s;&s;erted, that a no&s;trum or an univer&s;al remedy is as great a <HI>de&s;ideratum</HI> as
<PB N="29" REF="039111_0059_10139EC304199B38">
the philo&s;opher's &s;tone. The ab&s;urd idea of an univer&s;al medicine can only obtain credit with the weak, the credulous, or the igno|rant.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t unfortunate circum&s;tances in the hi&s;tory of &s;uch medicines, is the in&s;in|uating and dangerous method, by which they are <HI>puffed</HI> into notice. And as we hear little of the baneful effects which they daily mu&s;t produce, by being promi&s;cuou&s;ly applied, peo|ple attend only to the extraordinary in&s;tan|ces, perhaps not one in fifty, where they have afforded a temporary or apparent relief. It is well known, that the more powerful a remedy is, the more permanent and danger|ous mu&s;t be its effects on the con&s;titution; e&s;pecially if it be introduced like many Patent. Medicines, by an almo&s;t indefinite increa&s;e of the do&s;es.</P>
<P>There is another con&s;ideration, not apt to &s;trike tho&s;e who are unacquainted with the laws of animal economy.&mdash;When we intend to bring about any remarkable change in the &s;y&s;tem of an organized body, we are obliged to employ &s;uch means as may contribute to produce that change, without affecting too violently the <HI>living powers;</HI> or without ex|tending their action to an improper length. Indeed, the patient may be gradually habitu|ated to almo&s;t any &s;timulus, but at the expen&s;e of pal&s;ied organs, and a broken con&s;titution.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>An Italian Count, uncommonly fond of &s;wallowing medicines, found at length that he could take no more. Previous to his death he ordered the following in&s;cription to be placed on his tomb:</P>
<P>"<HI>I was once healthy; I wi&s;hed to be better; I took medicine, and died.</HI>"</P></NOTE>

Such are the melancholy effects of impo&s;ture and credulity! Were it po&s;&s;ible to collect all the ca&s;es of &s;acrifices to this my&s;terious infat|uation, it is probable that their number would exceed the enormous havoc made by gun-powder or the &s;word.</P>
<P>A popular writer, Dr. BUCHAN, makes the following ju&s;t remark on the &s;ubject in que&s;|tion: "As matters &s;tand at pre&s;ent," &s;ays he, "it is ea&s;ier to cheat a man out of his life, than of a &s;hilling, and almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible either to detect or puni&s;h the offender.

<P>The greater number of our fa&s;hionable complaints and affections are nearly related

to each other. The gout, formerly a regular but rare di&s;ea&s;e, which attacked only the ex|ternal parts of per&s;ons advanced in years, has now become a con&s;titutional indi&s;po&s;ition, a juvenile complaint, torturing the patient in a thou&s;and different forms. The famous <HI>Poda|gra</HI> and <HI>Chiragra</HI> of our ance&s;tors are now nearly ob&s;olete, and in&s;tead of the gout in the <HI>feet</HI> or <HI>hands,</HI> we hear every day of the nerv|ous gout, the gout in the <HI>head,</HI> and even the fatal gout in the <HI>&s;tomach.</HI> No rank, no age, no mode of life &s;eems to be exempt from this fa&s;hionable enemy.&mdash;The next and &s;till more general malady of the times, is <HI>an extreme &s;en|&s;ibility to every change of the atmo&s;phere; or rath|er, a con&s;tantly &s;en&s;ible relation to its influence.</HI> We are not only more &s;ubject to be affected with every current of air, every change of heat and cold, but the feelings of &s;ome are &s;o exqui&s;itely delicate, that in a clo&s;e apartment, nay in bed, they can determine with accura|cy the &s;tate of the weather, as well as the di|rection of the wind. By con&s;ulting their bodily &s;en&s;ations, the&s;e <HI>living barometers</HI> an|nounce more correctly than the artificial ones, not only the pre&s;ent, but even the future changes of the weather.

In a climate, where the weather

changes every day, and almo&s;t every hour, it may be ea&s;ily imagined, how dependent, frail, and tran&s;itory, mu&s;t be the health of the wretched po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of this <HI>new</HI> &s;en&s;e; and that beings &s;o organized cannot warrant, for a &s;ingle hour, their &s;tate of health, their good-humour, or their phy&s;ical exi&s;tence. Is it not then very probable, that many &s;trange and in|con&s;i&s;tent events of our days may have their &s;ecret foundation in this dependence on the weather?&mdash;In judging of man and his actions, we ought fir&s;t to ob&s;erve the &s;tate of the ba|rometer; as our more &s;uper&s;titious ance&s;tors made the cele&s;tial con&s;tellations the criterion in their progno&s;tics.</P>
<P>Not le&s;s characteri&s;tic of the pre&s;ent gener|ation, but more painful, are the fa&s;hionable nervous and hypochondriacal di&s;ea&s;es. The&s;e are formidable, in&s;idious tormentors, which not only de&s;troy our phy&s;ical well-being, but al&s;o envenom our tranquillity and content|ment, and cloud our faire&s;t pro&s;pects of hap|pine&s;s. Without depriving us of life, they render it an in&s;upportable burthen; without inducing death, they make him a welcome vi&s;itor.</P>
<P>It is unnece&s;&s;ary to detail the diver&s;ified &s;hapes, in which the&s;e maladies pre&s;ent them|&s;elves.

Clo&s;ely connected with the gout, and likewi&s;e with the hypochondria&s;is, how frequently do we ob&s;erve the haemorrhoids, formerly a di&s;|ea&s;e of the aged, now the companion of youth, and almo&s;t a general complaint.</P>
<P>The la&s;t cla&s;s of our fa&s;hionable di&s;ea&s;es in|cludes all tho&s;e affections of the &s;kin, which are known by the name of <HI>eruptions, di&s;colora|tions, efflore&s;cences, &s;corbutic taints,</HI> &amp;c. Of late, the&s;e have alarmingly increa&s;ed, and appear daily to &s;pread every where, like noxious weeds. Even in the higher ranks, where neither a poor diet, nor want of attention to cleanline&s;s, can be a&s;&s;igned as cau&s;es, we fre|quently ob&s;erve per&s;ons, who&s;e &s;kin announces bad health, and on whom medicine can have no effect. Phy&s;icians of different countries complain of new and unheard-of cutaneous di&s;orders, of an extremely malignant tenden|cy; and if the &s;preading of them be not check|ed in time, Europe will perhaps once more be vi&s;ited with that malignant and filthy di&s;|ea&s;e, the Lepro&s;y.</P>

<P>Much as we hear and &s;peak of <HI>bathing,</HI> and of the great attention at pre&s;ent paid to clean|line&s;s, I am bold to affirm, that the greater number, if not the whole of our fa&s;hionable complaints, originate from the want of care and proper management of the <HI>&s;kin.</HI> Through unpardonable neglect in the earlier part of life, e&s;pecially at the age of adole&s;cence, the &s;urface of the body is &s;o unnaturally enervat|ed by con&s;tant relaxation, that it oppre&s;&s;es, and, as it were, confines our mental and bod|ily faculties; promotes the general di&s;po&s;ition towards the complaints above alluded to; and, if not counteracted in time, mu&s;t pro|duce con&s;equences &s;till more alarming and deplorable.</P>
<P>We often hear people complain, that <HI>their &s;kin is unea&s;y;</HI> a complaint, which I fear is but too prevalent among tho&s;e, who give them|&s;elves little trouble to inquire into its origin.&mdash;But how is it po&s;&s;ible, I hear many per&s;ons a&s;k, that the &s;kin, which is a mere covering of the body, to &s;helter it from rain and &s;un|&s;hine, can have &s;uch influence over the whole frame? I &s;hall venture to explain this problem, and hope to impre&s;s &s;uch as are inclined to be &s;ceptical, with more re&s;pect for that part of the human body.</P>
<P>The &s;kin unites in it&s;elf three very e&s;&s;ential functions. It is the organ of the mo&s;t exten|&s;ive
<PB N="35" REF="039111_0065_10139EC9E8D90030">
and u&s;eful &s;en&s;e, that of <HI>touch;</HI> it is the channel of <HI>per&s;piration,</HI> the principal means which Nature employs to purify our fluids; and through the mo&s;t admirable organization, is enabled to <HI>ab&s;orb</HI> certain &s;alutary parts of the &s;urrounding atmo&s;phere, and to guard us again&s;t the influence of others of an injurious tendency. For this purpo&s;e, innumerable nerves and ve&s;&s;els are di&s;per&s;ed throughout the &s;kin, which are in the continual act of feeling, and at the &s;ame time of &s;ecreting and volatilizing noxious particles, and ab&s;orbing tho&s;e containing vital principles. It has been proved by accurate calculations, that the mo&s;t healthy individual daily and in&s;en&s;ibly per|&s;pires upwards of three pounds weight of &s;u|perfluous and hurtful humours. It may therefore be confidently a&s;&s;erted, that no part of the body is provided with &s;o many and important organs, by which it is connected with almo&s;t every operation performed in an|imal life, as the &s;kin. It is this, which places us in the mo&s;t immediate connexion with the &s;urrounding atmo&s;phere, which through that channel particularly affects us, and exerts its influence on our health:&mdash;we further feel, directly through the &s;kin, the qualities of the air, heat, cold, pre&s;&s;ure, rarefaction, &amp;c.: and hence we experience, at lea&s;t in their influ|ence, other much more &s;ubtle and le&s;s known qualities, of which I &s;hall only mention the electric and magnetic fluids. From the &s;pir|itual and highly penetrating nature of the&s;e fluids, we may ea&s;ily conjecture, how con&s;id|erable a &s;hare they mu&s;t have in the princi|ple
<PB N="36" REF="039111_0066_10139E8C47BABAB0">
of vitality, and of what important u&s;e the organ is, through which they affect us.</P>
<P>Important as the &s;kin is to external life, it is no le&s;s &s;o to the internal economy of the body, where it appears to be peculiarly de|&s;igned to pre&s;erve the great equilibrium of the different &s;y&s;tems, by which the human frame is &s;upported in its vital, animal, and &s;exual functions.&mdash;If any &s;tagnation, accumu|lation, or irregularity ari&s;e in the fluids, the &s;kin is the great and ever-ready conductor, through which the &s;uperfluous particles are &s;eparated, the noxious volatilized, and the fluids, &s;tagnating in their cour&s;e, &s;et at liber|ty; a canal being at the &s;ame time opened for the removal of tho&s;e humours which, if they &s;hould get acce&s;s to the vital parts, &s;uch as the heart and the brain, would cau&s;e inev|itable de&s;truction. By the proper exerci&s;e of this organ, many di&s;ea&s;es may be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed in their early &s;tages; and tho&s;e which have already taken place may be mo&s;t effectually removed. No di&s;ea&s;e whatever can be re|moved without the co-operation of the &s;kin. The nature and con&s;titution of this organ mo&s;t certainly determine either our hope or ap|prehen&s;ion for the &s;afety of the patient. In the mo&s;t dangerous inflammatory fevers, when the pro&s;pect of recovery is very faint, a beneficial change of the &s;kin is the only effort, by which Nature, almo&s;t overcome, relieves her&s;elf, and ejects the poi&s;on in a &s;urpri&s;ing manner, fre|quently in the cour&s;e of one night. The greate&s;t art of a phy&s;ician, indeed, con&s;i&s;ts in the proper management of this exten&s;ive or|gan,
<PB N="37" REF="039111_0067_10139ECD7679E088">
and in regulating its activity, where oc|ca&s;ion requires. To mention only one cir|cum&s;tance; it is well known to tho&s;e who have experienced the beneficial effects of a &s;imple bli&s;ter, that its &s;timulus, like a charm, has frequently relieved the mo&s;t excruciating pains and &s;pa&s;ms in the internal parts.</P>
<P><HI>Cleanline&s;s, flexibility</HI> and <HI>activity</HI> of the &s;kin are, according to the ob&s;ervations premi&s;ed, the principal requi&s;ites to the health of indi|viduals, as well as of whole nations. But in|&s;tead of contributing to its improvement, we generally pay very little attention to it, ex|cept to the &s;kin of the face and hands, which are too often made the <HI>fallacious</HI> index of health. I am convinced, however, that mo&s;t of the patients and valetudinarians, who take &s;o much pains to refre&s;h and fortify the <HI>inter|nal</HI> parts of their body, by invigorating pota|tions, rarely, if ever, pay any regard to their <HI>external</HI> &s;urface;&mdash;an object of equal impor|tance, and perhaps &s;tanding in much greater need of corroborants than the former. Hence it happens, that the &s;kin of convale&s;|cents is ob&s;erved to be particularly relaxed and ob&s;tructed; that they are liable to con|tinual colds, upon the lea&s;t change of temper|ature; and that every day of their recovery renders them more &s;ubject to relap&s;es.</P>
<P>In this country, the children of people in the middling and lower ranks are perhaps bet|ter managed, than in mo&s;t of the countries upon the Continent; becau&s;e frequent and daily bathing is, to my certain knowledge, no where &s;o generally practi&s;ed as in England.
<PB N="38" REF="039111_0068_10139E8ED22DC348">
As &s;oon, however, as children attain a certain age, this practice is again as generally neglect|ed: after the tenth or twelfth year of age, the &s;urface of the body is very little attended to. Thus a foundation is laid for numberle&s;s evils, and particularly for that &s;corbutic taint in the human &s;y&s;tem, which now almo&s;t uni|ver&s;ally prevails, and which is more or le&s;s connected with other and more fa&s;hionable complaints.&mdash;As we advance further in years, this di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;kin increa&s;es &s;till more, particularly from the mode of life pur&s;ued in the higher ranks. We then begin to accu&s;|tom our&s;elves to &s;edentary habits, to think, and to partake of the plea&s;ures of life. The lady, the man of fortune, and the ill-fated man of letters, all of them require <HI>more active</HI> exerci&s;e, than they actually take, which alone can promote a free per&s;piration, and enliven the &s;urface of the body; but, by their indo|lent habits, the whole machine &s;tagnates, and the &s;kin becomes contracted and debilitated.</P>
<P>The hu&s;bandman, indeed, labours diligent|ly; and though, by the &s;weat of his brow, his &s;kin pre&s;erves more life and activity, it is neither kept &s;ufficiently clean, nor prevented from being ob&s;tructed by per&s;pirable matter. The arti&s;t and manufacturer carry on their pur&s;uits in a &s;edentary manner, and in a con|fined, impure air; the latter, in the duties of his occupation, generally employs unwhole|&s;ome articles, &s;o that at length he lo&s;es the u&s;e of this organ entirely, in &s;ome parts of the body. The voluptuary and the glutton do not &s;uffer le&s;s than the former, as they impair the
<PB N="39" REF="039111_0069_10139ECF0131F438">
energy of the &s;kin by exce&s;&s;es of every kind, and take no precautions to pre&s;erve its ela&s;tic texture.&mdash;Our u&s;ual articles of dre&s;s, flannel excepted, are not calculated to promote a free per&s;piration;&mdash;our coal-fires, and &s;till more the large potations of <HI>warm</HI> liquors, contri|bute greatly to relax the &s;kin. If we add to this li&s;t of predi&s;po&s;ing cau&s;es, our incon&s;tant climate, which at one hour of the day braces, and at another relaxes the &s;urface of the body, which alternately heats and cools it, and con|&s;equently di&s;turbs its uniform action; it will be ea&s;ily under&s;tood, that the &s;kin mu&s;t for the&s;e rea&s;ons be almo&s;t generally vitiated, and that it really is a leading &s;ource of many of our fa&s;hionable indi&s;po&s;itions.</P>
<P>When the &s;en&s;ation of the &s;urface is im|paired; when the myriads of orifices, that are de&s;igned for the continual purification and renovation of our fluids, are ob&s;tructed, if not clo&s;ed; when the &s;ubtle nervous texture is nearly deprived of its energy, &s;o that it be|comes an <HI>impenetrable coat of mail,</HI> is there any rea&s;on to wonder, that we are &s;o often hara&s;&s;|ed by a &s;en&s;e of con&s;traint and anxiety, and that this unea&s;ine&s;s, in many ca&s;es, terminates in a de&s;ponding gloom, and at length in complete melancholy?&mdash;A&s;k the hypochon|driac, whether a certain degree of cold, pale|ne&s;s, and a &s;pa&s;modic &s;en&s;ation in the &s;kin, do not always precede his mo&s;t violent fits of mental debility; and whether his feelings are not mo&s;t comfortable, when the &s;urface of his body is vigorous, warm, and per&s;pires freely? In &s;hort, the degrees of in&s;en&s;ible per|&s;piration
<PB N="40" REF="039111_0070_10139E90581EDDA0">
are to him the &s;afe&s;t barometer of his &s;tate of mind. If our &s;kin be di&s;organiz|ed, the free inlets and outlets of the electric, magnetic, and other matters, which affect us at the change of the weather, are inactive. Thus the origin of extreme &s;en&s;ibility towards the various atmo&s;pheric revolutions, is no longer a my&s;tery. For, in a healthy &s;urface of the body, no inconvenience will follow from &s;uch changes.&mdash;If we further advert to tho&s;e acrimonious fluids which, in an imper|fect &s;tate of per&s;piration, are retained in our body, and which &s;ettle upon the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible nerves and membranes,&mdash;we &s;hall better ap|prehend, how cramps or &s;pa&s;ms, the tortur|ing pains of the Gout and Rheumati&s;m, and the great variety of cutaneous di&s;ea&s;es, have of late become &s;o ob&s;tinate and general.</P>
<P>The equilibrium of the fluids, and the cir|culation of the blood, are al&s;o determined in no &s;mall degree by the &s;kin; &s;o that if the&s;e fluids become thick and languid, the whole momentum of the blood is repelled towards the interior parts. Thus a continual plethora, or fulne&s;s of the blood, is occa&s;ioned; the head and brea&s;t are greatly oppre&s;&s;ed; and the external parts, e&s;pecially the lower ex|tremities, feel chilly and lifele&s;s.</P>
<P>In warm climates, in Italy for in&s;tance, the haemorrhoids, a very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing com|plaint, are but rarely met with, notwith&s;tand|ing the luxurious and &s;en&s;ual mode of life of the inhabitants; becau&s;e per&s;piration is al|ways free and unchecked: while among us per&s;ons are found, who devote the whole of
<PB N="41" REF="039111_0071_10139ED19D3AAE68">
their attention to the cure of that trouble&s;ome di&s;order.</P>
<P>May we not infer, from what I have thus advanced, that the u&s;e of baths is too much neglected, and ought to be univer&s;ally intro|duced? It is not &s;ufficient, for the great pur|po&s;es here alluded to, that a few of the more wealthy families repair every &s;ea&s;on to wa|tering-places, or that they even make u&s;e of other modes of bathing, either for their health or amu&s;ement. A very different method mu&s;t be pur&s;ued, if we &s;eriou&s;ly wi&s;h to re|&s;tore the vigour of a degenerated race. I mean here to inculcate the indi&s;pen&s;able ne|ce&s;&s;ity for <HI>dome&s;tic baths,</HI> &s;o well known among the ancients, and &s;o univer&s;ally e&s;tabli&s;hed all over Europe, a few centuries ago, and which were eminently calculated to check the fur|ther progre&s;s of the lepro&s;y;&mdash;a di&s;ea&s;e which, though flower in its effects, is not le&s;s di&s;tre&s;&s;|ing than the plague it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Much has been &s;aid and written upon the various methods, and the univer&s;al medicines, propo&s;ed in different ages, by different ad|venturers, profe&s;&s;edly to dimini&s;h the inhe|rent di&s;po&s;ition to di&s;ea&s;e, and to give a new and renovating principle to the human frame. At one time they expected to find it in the philo&s;ophic and <HI>a&s;tralian &s;alis,</HI> at another in Magneti&s;m and Electricity;&mdash;&s;ome fanatics pretended to have di&s;covered it in the light of the moon, others in cele&s;tial beds;&mdash;but, if I may venture to deliver my opinion, we may &s;earch for it mo&s;t &s;afely and conveniently
<PB N="42" REF="039111_0072_10139E92E84D3AF0">
in every clear fountain&mdash;in the bo&s;om of ever young, ever animating nature.</P>
<P><HI>Bathing</HI> may be al&s;o con&s;idered as an excel|lent &s;pecific for alleviating both mental and bodily &s;ufferings. It is not merely a clean&s;er of the &s;kin, enlivening and rendering it more fit for performing its offices; but it al&s;o re|fre&s;hes the mind, and &s;preads over the whole &s;y&s;tem a &s;en&s;ation of ea&s;e, activity, and plea&s;|antne&s;s. It further removes &s;tagnation in the larger as well as in the capillary ve&s;&s;els; it gives an uniform free circulation to the blood, and pre&s;erves that wonderful harmony in our interior organs, on the di&s;po&s;ition of which our health and comfort &s;o much depend. A per&s;on fatigued, or di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in body and mind, will derive more refre&s;hment from the luxury of a lukewarm bath, and may drown his di&s;|quietude in it more effectually, than by in|dulging in copious libations to Bacchus. The bath may be equally recommended as an ad|mirable retiring place, to evade, for a time, the influence of the atmo&s;phere; and per&s;ons that have the misfortune to be too &s;u&s;ceptible of external impre&s;&s;ions, would find no &s;mall benefit, were they to repair in thick and &s;ul|try weather to the bath, where they breathe in an element le&s;s loaded with noxious parti|cles.</P>
<P>The wi&s;h to enjoy perpetual youth, is one of the mo&s;t predominant and pardonable. Though it cannot be rationally a&s;&s;erted, that bathing will confer continual youth, yet I will hazard an opinion, that it has a very un|common and &s;uperior tendency to prolong
<PB N="43" REF="039111_0073_10139ED426119EE8">
that happy &s;tate; it pre&s;erves all the &s;olid parts &s;oft and pliable, and renders the joints of the body flexible. Hence it powerfully counteracts, what I pre&s;ume to call an in&s;idi|ous di&s;ea&s;e, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>age,</HI> which operates by grad|ually exhau&s;ting the humours, and depriving the con&s;tituent parts of the human frame of their ela&s;ticity. It is no le&s;s certain, that bath|ing is one of the mo&s;t efficacious means of pre&s;erving beauty; and that tho&s;e nations, among which bathing is a prevailing practice, are u&s;ually the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed for elegance of form and beauty of complexion.</P>
<P>A moderate de&s;ire to improve and beautify the &s;urface of the body, is far from being a frivolous pur&s;uit. It excites as much intere&s;t, and is productive of as beneficial con&s;equences, as the exertions of many a p&s;eudo-philo&s;|opher, who devotes the toil of years, to ar|range his notions in a certain &s;y&s;tematic form, and who yet is not fortunate enough to at|tain the great object of his wi&s;h. I have had frequent opportunities to ob&s;erve, that the de&s;ire of beauty, when not inordinate, may prove the &s;ource of many virtuous and laud|able pur&s;uits, and that it may be greatly in|&s;trumental to the pre&s;ervation of health. I am al&s;o per&s;uaded, that this de&s;ire is often pur&s;ued by methods not the mo&s;t proper, and that from not having a ju&s;t knowledge of beauty, we make many valuable &s;acrifices, not only of things relating to health, but &s;ometimes of life it&s;elf. In&s;tances are not un|common, of young per&s;ons attempting to bleach their &s;kins, and beautify their per&s;ons,
<PB N="44" REF="039111_0074_10139E96C01F6710">
by avoiding a free air, u&s;ing a mild and weak|ening diet, long fa&s;ting, long &s;leeping, warm|ing their beds, &amp;c. &amp;c.; but, alas! the event does not an&s;wer their expectation,&mdash;they lo&s;e both health and bloom!&mdash;Eating chalk, drink|ing vinegar, wearing camphorated charms, and &s;imilar de&s;tructive means have been re|&s;orted to, by other more daring adventurers, but with no better &s;ucce&s;s. Tho&s;e I have la&s;t enumerated, may be called the <HI>minor co&s;metics:</HI> others of a more formidable nature, I almo&s;t he&s;itate to mention, as they are unque&s;tiona|bly the mo&s;t deleterious &s;ub&s;tances we are ac|quainted with. <HI>Mercury</HI> and <HI>lead,</HI> manufac|tured in various forms, are unhappily too common ingredients in many of our <HI>modern</HI> co&s;metics, whether they con&s;i&s;t of lotions, creams, powders, paints or ointments. That the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances can be communicated to the circulating fluids, through the &s;kin as well as by the &s;tomach, requires, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, no further proof, after the doctrines already advanced on this &s;ubject. <HI>Lead,</HI> in particular, if once introduced into the &s;y&s;tem, though in the &s;malle&s;t proportions, cannot be removed by art, and never fails to produce the mo&s;t deplorable effects; &s;uch as pal&s;y, contraction and convul&s;ion of the limbs, total lamene&s;s, weakne&s;s, and the mo&s;t excruciating colic pains. Be&s;ides the&s;e more obvious effects, the frequent external u&s;e of lead and mercu|ry, as co&s;metics, occa&s;ions cramps in every part of the body, faintings, nervous weakne&s;s, catarrhs, tubercles in the lungs and inte&s;tines, which occur together or &s;eparately, according
<PB N="45" REF="039111_0075_10139ED7C92EAD70">
to the different circum&s;tances, till at length a con&s;umption, either pulmonary or hectic, clo&s;es the dreadful &s;cene.</P>
<P>Beauty of the &s;kin, the &s;ubject under con|&s;ideration at pre&s;ent, is but another term for a found and healthy &s;kin;&mdash;a pure mirror of the harmony of the internal parts with their &s;urface, or, if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion, "<HI>it is vi&s;ible health.</HI>"</P>
<P>There &s;ub&s;i&s;ts &s;o intimate a relation between our interior and exterior ve&s;&s;els, that almo&s;t every error or irregularity in the organs within, &s;hows it&s;elf fir&s;t of all on the &s;urface without, and particularly on the face.&mdash;How often are we &s;truck at the countenance of a per&s;on, who thinks him&s;elf in perfect health, but who&s;e illne&s;s, the re&s;ult of &s;ome morbid cau&s;e concealed in the body, ju&s;tifies in a few days the &s;erious apprehen&s;ions we entertained at our la&s;t interview. Nature has wi&s;ely or|dained, that the fir&s;t appearance of internal irregularities is indicated by the countenance; but to what u&s;e do we generally apply this index?&mdash;We refu&s;e to avail our&s;elves of her beneficent intimation; and the continued u&s;e of pernicious &s;ub&s;tances, in&s;tead of promoting the object we have in view, ultimately tar|ni&s;hes and impairs that beauty, which we meant to adorn and pre&s;erve. We imagine it in our power to improve the &s;kin, without attending to the purity of the fluids, although it is indebted to them for its very exi&s;tence; and yet &s;hould &s;mile at a per&s;on, who attempt|ed to clean&s;e an impure tongue, by con&s;tantly &s;craping it, when a di&s;ordered &s;tomach was the real cau&s;e of that impurity.</P>

From the tenor of the preceding po&s;itions, I hope for indulgence, when I venture to pro|nounce every co&s;metic, who&s;e compo&s;ition is kept a &s;ecret from the public, fal&s;e and fraud|ulent ware.

<P>To the&s;e three general ob&s;ervations, I think, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ubjoin a few particular injunctions, relative to the improvement of the &s;kin, as connected with a &s;tate of good health.&mdash;Carefully avoid all <HI>immoderate</HI> and <HI>vi|olent dancing,</HI> as the &s;udden alternations of heat and cold, not only impair the general &s;tate of the &s;kin, but are likewi&s;e of the greate&s;t detri|ment to beauty.&mdash;Ab&s;tain from the too fre|quent and too copious u&s;e of heating liquors of every kind, particularly punch and &s;trong wines. There is &s;carcely any thing which is, in my opinion, more de&s;tructive of the bloom of youth and manhood, than this <HI>liquid fire,</HI> which fills the blood with inflammable particles, pro|pels them towards the face, parches the &s;kin, renders it &s;potted, and lays the foundation of that incurable di&s;ea&s;e, which is &s;ometimes fig|uratively called <HI>copper in the face.</HI> Neither &s;u|gar, nor any additional ingredient to gratify the palate, can deprive the&s;e liquors of their noxious qualities, &s;o that even the mo&s;t agree|able of the&s;e &s;eductive potions is attended with con&s;iderable danger.</P>
<P>Avoid, likewi&s;e, every exce&s;s in <HI>hot</HI> drinks, as coffee, chocolate, and tea, particularly the la&s;t, in which the people of this country are given to indulge, more than in any other beverage. I &s;carcely dare venture to impeach
<PB N="48" REF="039111_0078_10139E9AD0549E48">
this favourite <HI>&s;olace</HI> of our morning and even|ing hours; but with all due deference to the comforts of the dome&s;tic circle, I con&s;ider it as my duty to denounce the too liberal u&s;e of this liquor, as not a little prejudicial to the fairne&s;s and purity of the &s;kin. Tea taken hot, and in immoderate quantities, not only has a tendency to weaken the organs of dige&s;|tion, but cau&s;es fluctuations and conge&s;tions in the humours of the face, and frequently brings on a degree of debilitating per&s;piration. Let us conceive the &s;tomach inundated with a portion of warm water, ju&s;t at the time of dige&s;tion; its concoctive powers are literally drowned, at the very in&s;tant when their a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance is mo&s;t required; and, in&s;tead of a pure bal&s;amic <HI>chyle,</HI> or alimentary fluid, it prepares crude, and acrimonious humours, which can only generate an unhealthy ma&s;s of blood. Here, I cannot impre&s;s upon the attentive read|er, in terms &s;ufficiently &s;trong, the following truth: <HI>that a healthy &s;tomach only can produce healthy and uncontaminated fluids;</HI> and that two thirds of what we call acrimony, or &s;harpne&s;s of humours in the &s;y&s;tem, proceed from a languid &s;tomach, and irregular dige&s;tion.&mdash;If therefore the tea be made too weak, it will operate merely as warm water, and like it will greatly relax the coat and membranes of the &s;tomach;&mdash;if made too &s;trong, it will give an unnatural heat to the body, prove a dan|gerous &s;timulus to the nerves, occa&s;ion palpi|tations of the heart, univer&s;al trembling, cramps, and a number of other complaints, which it is needle&s;s to enumerate. That the&s;e
<PB N="49" REF="039111_0079_10139EDBE142EC50">
effects do not take place, during the fir&s;t months or years of indulging our&s;elves in the intemperate u&s;e of hot and &s;trong tea, is no argument to controvert this po&s;ition; they will, either &s;ooner or later, unavoidably fol|low.</P>
<P>I &s;hall but &s;lightly touch here, on another &s;ubject, &s;carcely of le&s;s importance than the former; namely, the various articles prepared by the pa&s;try-cook and confectioner. The&s;e dainties would be le&s;s objectionable, if any method could be devi&s;ed of baking them without the pernicious ingredients of yea&s;t and fat, &s;ub&s;tances which load the &s;tomach with a glutinous &s;lime and rancid matter, which ob&s;truct the glands of the abdomen, particularly tho&s;e of the me&s;entery, and which have a &s;trong tendency to produce the cuta|neous di&s;ea&s;es before mentioned.</P>

<HEAD>On the Phy&s;ical Education of Children.</HEAD>
<P>THE phy&s;ical education<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To &s;ome readers it may be nece&s;&s;ary to explain, that by <HI>phy&s;ical education</HI> is meant the bodily treatment of children: the term <HI>phy&s;ical</HI> being applied in oppo&s;ition to <HI>moral.</HI></NOTE> of infants unque&s;|tionably forms an object of the fir&s;t impor|tance. The great di&s;proportion &s;ub&s;i&s;ting be|tween healthy and di&s;ea&s;ed children, together with the deplorable mortality which occurs among the latter, too plainly evince, that their <HI>bodily</HI> welfare is not &s;ufficiently attend|ed to.</P>
<P>There is little room to doubt, that by a more rational mode of nurture, during the
<PB N="50" REF="039111_0080_10139E9C55C8EB68">
fir&s;t years of infancy, many &s;ub&s;equent di&s;ea&s;es might either be wholly prevented, or at lea&s;t greatly mitigated. Nothing perhaps would contribute more to meliorate education in general, than, what has been long and much wanted, a &s;erious and minute attention of the Faculty to this particular branch of medical &s;tudy: which at pre&s;ent, I am concerned to &s;ay, is almo&s;t totally neglected.</P>
<P>The few books extant on this &s;ubject are neither written on &s;cientific principles, nor calculated, by their manner and &s;tyle, to af|ford plain and popular in&s;truction. It is not enough for profe&s;&s;ional men to plan &s;y&s;tems of education in their &s;tudy-rooms;&mdash;let them al&s;o demon&s;trate in practice, that they are familiarly acquainted with the <HI>true</HI> method of educating children;&mdash;a method which; in my opinion, implies &s;omewhat more than merely pre&s;cribing and admini&s;tering medi|cines.</P>
<P>So long as the nur&s;ing of children remains exclu&s;ively in the hands of common midwives and nur&s;es, it is rather a matter of &s;urpri&s;e, that &s;o many infants &s;hould &s;urvive the age of childhood.&mdash;We ought therefore, above all things, to inquire into the mon&s;trous preju|dices prevailing in this e&s;&s;ential part of dome&s;|tic management, as the fir&s;t &s;tep towards their extirpation.</P>
<P>How great would be my &s;atisfaction, if, by the following &s;trictures, I &s;hould be able to prevail upon &s;ome intelligent mothers, who po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ufficient fortitude, to throw off the bondage of old cu&s;toms, or modern fa&s;hions,
<PB N="51" REF="039111_0081_10139EDFB2E65988">
and to return to the path of &s;imple nature!&mdash;In a &s;y&s;tem of practical education, it is a judi|cious precept, which cannot be too much in|culcated, <HI>to omit rather than to undertake, or be too officious, in the phy&s;ical treatment of infants.</HI></P>
<P>From the difficulty of di&s;covering the true cau&s;e and &s;eat of the complaints of children, e&s;pecially if accompanied with any particular &s;ymptoms in the excretory ve&s;&s;els, it is very u&s;ual to admini&s;ter a <HI>gentle laxative</HI> or <HI>emetic,</HI> upon the &s;lighte&s;t occa&s;ion.&mdash;It would lead me too far to examine, in detail, the many bad con&s;equences re&s;ulting from &s;o ab&s;urd and detrimental a practice. I cannot, however, forbear from remarking, that by dealing con|&s;tantly in aperient medicines (a &s;trange infatu|ation among the vulgar!) the future di&s;ea&s;es of the child a&s;&s;ume a particular character of the <HI>ga&s;tric</HI> kind&mdash;the juice of the &s;tomach, which &s;erves to concoct our food, being vitiated. As the operation of the laxatives is in a manner mechanical, by impelling the fluids, and partic|ularly tho&s;e of the mucous kind, towards the &s;tomach and bowels, and cau&s;ing them to ac|cumulate in a greater degree than u&s;ual, it will be ea&s;ily under&s;tood, that by the frequent repetition of this &s;timulus, the ga&s;tric juice will be rendered unfit to effect the proper &s;o|lution of food in the &s;tomach. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, per&s;ons &s;ubject to frequent co&s;tivene&s;s &s;oon begin to complain of indige&s;tion, when they once habituate them&s;elves to take AN|DERSON'S or any other aperient pills: for by them the &s;tomach is converted, as it were, into a field of battle, where all the ir|regularities,
<PB N="52" REF="039111_0082_10139E9EF21C3388">
that take place in the &s;y&s;tem, are left to fight their way; where the limits of di&s;ea&s;e and health, nay the alternative of life and death, are to be finally determined. That this however is not the mo&s;t proper place for &s;uch a conte&s;t, requires no demon&s;tration. The &s;tomach is appointed by nature for very different purpo&s;es; it is the only organ of nouri&s;hment and dige&s;tion; the &s;ource of re&s;|toration and health. But how can it effec|tually an&s;wer this end, if it &s;erves, at the &s;ame time, as the con&s;tant laboratory of di&s;ea&s;es? As it is always in a &s;tate of impurity, it can|not act with uniform energy and a &s;ufficient degree of ela&s;ticity, to prevent frequent irreg|ularities in dige&s;tion;&mdash;hence ari&s;e bad hu|mours, hypochondriac affections, and nervous debility; all of which, I have rea&s;on to fear, are, more or le&s;s, con&s;equences of tampering with medicines, e&s;pecially in the period of childhood. I am further induced to think, though it may to &s;ome appear rather a bold idea, that more children are de&s;troyed by the ab&s;urd practice of loading their tender &s;tom|achs with every &s;ort of tra&s;h, and afterwards relieving them by repeated do&s;es of phy&s;ic, than by any <HI>natural</HI> proce&s;s. This likewi&s;e accounts for the great number of children who die <HI>in towns,</HI> at an early age, before they become inured to &s;uch &s;evere attacks made on their dige&s;tive organs.</P>
<P>In order to check, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to pre|vent, this general tendency to di&s;ea&s;es; to meliorate the con&s;titution of children, by producing a regular circulation of the fluids;
<PB N="53" REF="039111_0083_10139EE137A46668">
and to direct the exuding morbid matter more univer&s;ally and uniformly through the pores of the &s;kin, a more effectual remedy cannot be &s;ugge&s;ted, than that of <HI>frequent bath|ing,</HI> and a very limited u&s;e of aperient medi|cines.</P>
<P>The&s;e ob&s;ervations are not conjectural, but founded on experience, and it gives me plea&s;|ure to add, that they are confirmed by many phy&s;icians of eminent abilities, and exten&s;ive practice.</P>
<P>Frequent bathing in infancy is a powerful mean of counteracting and &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the di&s;po&s;ition to &s;tomachic and bilious com|plaints, which, in our days, are uncommonly prevalent among children and adults, and which are frequently accompanied with diver|&s;ified nervous &s;ymptoms. By the efforts of nature, to throw off malignant humours by the &s;urface of the body, in con&s;equence of a proper u&s;e of the bath, many infantile di&s;ea&s;es may be &s;afely prevented, catarrhs &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, or greatly mitigated, teething rendered ea&s;y, and the whole phy&s;ical condition of the child con&s;iderably improved.</P>
<P>It becomes here a que&s;tion, which is the mo&s;t proper degree of heat in u&s;ing the bath for children.&mdash;I &s;hall venture to pronounce, upon the authority of the be&s;t modern authors, confirmed by my own experience and ob&s;er|vation, that the <HI>lukewarm bath,</HI> between 84 and 96&deg; of Fahrenheit's thermometer, rather more than new-milk warm, is, upon an aver|age, the mo&s;t &s;uitable temperature. An er|roneous notion too much prevails, that the
<PB N="54" REF="039111_0084_10139EA38AB2A9A8">
good effects of bathing are principally to be a&s;cribed to the <HI>cold bath.</HI> The u&s;e of any bath, indeed, whether cold or warm, that is, the &s;timulating impre&s;&s;ion excited by the water, is, of it&s;elf, an excellent tonic, &s;erving to brace and invigorate the whole &s;y&s;tem. Not to mention the comfortable &s;en&s;ations, that mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily attend the clean&s;ing and opening &s;o many millions of pores, with which the &s;kin is provided, it is farther re|markable, that water, formerly con&s;idered as a <HI>&s;imple</HI> element, is now pretty generally un|der&s;tood to be a <HI>compound</HI> body, con&s;i&s;ting of <HI>oxygen</HI> and <HI>hydrogen,</HI> or vital and inflammable air, the former of which, it is well known, promotes the proce&s;s of <HI>re&s;piration,</HI> and lite|rally feeds the vital principle in the human body. Although this a&s;&s;ertion re&s;ts chiefly on an hypothetical foundation, &s;o much is certain, that a lukewarm bath, u&s;ed for the legs alone, is found by experience to commu|nicate new &s;pirits to the weary traveller, al|mo&s;t in&s;tantly to remove the &s;en&s;e of languor, and to re-animate all his faculties. <HI>Bruce,</HI> the Aby&s;&s;inian traveller, remarks, that in the inten&s;e heat of that country, a lukewarm bath afforded him more refre&s;hment and vig|our, than a cold one. We ought farther to con&s;ider, that infants are accu&s;tomed &s;carcely to any other than a <HI>warm</HI> temperature. The cold bath belongs to the cla&s;s of <HI>heroic reme|dies,</HI> and in its &s;udden and vehement effects nearly re&s;embles electricity. It is moreover an axiom in medicine, that the means of &s;timulating and corroborating the &s;y&s;tem,
<PB N="55" REF="039111_0085_10139EE3CED76488">
&s;hould be in proportion to the degree of vital power in the individual; that a faint &s;park may be extingui&s;hed rather than kindled by too violent a concu&s;&s;ion of air; and that a degree of &s;timulus and invigoration, which agrees with a firm and robu&s;t body, may prove de&s;tructive to one that is weak and ten|der. It might therefore be extremely haz|ardous to employ a remedy, in the delicate frame of infants, which even adults &s;hould not re&s;ort to without the greate&s;t precaution. I pre&s;ume to go a &s;tep farther, and do not he&s;|itate to &s;ay, that the u&s;e of the cold bath, as far as relates to the treatment of children, is even DANGEROUS. Its principal mode of op|eration is by contracting the whole &s;urface of the body, and by cau&s;ing a general repul|&s;ion of the fluids towards the internal parts. Hence in a young and infirm body, which has very little internal <HI>reaction,</HI> the nece&s;&s;ary con|&s;equence of cold bathing will be an unequal di&s;tribution of the fluids, a partial or local &s;tagnation of them; and, what is wor&s;t of all, an accumulation of humours in the head, by which infants are frequently injured, before it is in their power to complain.&mdash;The lukewarm bath, on the contrary, produces an uniform revolution and &s;alutary purification of all the fluids. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, I con&s;ider the tepid bath as in every re&s;pect preferable, &s;ince it may be u&s;ed &s;omewhat cooler for &s;trong chil|dren, or warmer for tho&s;e of a weakly con&s;ti|tution, and the requi&s;ite degrees of heat be regulated according to the increa&s;ing age and &s;trength of the child. In &s;ummer, the water
<PB N="56" REF="039111_0086_10139EA6239008D0">
intended for bathing ought to be expo&s;ed the whole day to the rays of the &s;un, which will impart to it an agreeable and congenial warmth. Rain, or river-water, is the mo&s;t proper for this purpo&s;e; but if there be a ne|ce&s;&s;ity for u&s;ing &s;pring or well-water, it &s;hould be previou&s;ly &s;oftened with a &s;mall quantity of boiled water, in which a quarter of an ounce of &s;oap has been di&s;&s;olved, with the ad|dition of a little bran or oatmeal; or if milk can be had, it will be found a &s;till more u&s;e|ful ingredient. Here I would particularly rec|ommend not to boil the <HI>whole</HI> quantity of the water to be u&s;ed for bathing; as it would in that ca&s;e be deprived of its a&euml;rial con&s;tituents, which are not without their importance in the bath.&mdash;During the fir&s;t weeks and months, the child &s;hould not be &s;uffered to remain in the bath longer than five minutes, which time may be gradually increa&s;ed to a quarter of an hour. During the whole proce&s;s of bathing, the body &s;hould not remain inactive, but be gently rubbed with the hand, and af|terwards cleaned with a &s;oft &s;punge. It is of con&s;equence to attend to the point of time, when the child is taken out of the bath; for in almo&s;t every in&s;tance where warm bathing di&s;agrees with the child, it will be found ow|ing to neglect in not wiping and drying the body with &s;ufficient expedition at this partic|ular period. Hence it is highly nece&s;&s;ary to keep warm cloaths in readine&s;s, in which the child &s;hould be wrapped up, and dried, the very moment it is taken out of the bath. Every one in the habit of bathing mu&s;t have
<PB N="57" REF="039111_0087_10139EE559709E78">
ob&s;erved, that the evaporation of water on the &s;kin excites penetrating and uncomfortable &s;en&s;ations of cold; and there is an a&s;toni&s;h|ing difference of temperature between actu|ally being in the water, and having water on the &s;kin after quitting the bath. If, there|fore, a child, from want of due precaution, be kept for &s;everal minutes with a naked, wet body, it will be liable to contract a cold, the more dangerous in its con&s;equences, as it immediately &s;ucceeds a &s;tate, in which the body is warm and the &s;kin open.</P>
<P>It &s;hould be further ob&s;erved, that bathing, immediately after a meal, or with a full &s;tom|ach, is highly improper, if not dangerous, both in children and adults; nor is it advi&s;|able, in rough weather, to carry a child into the open air too &s;oon after bathing. The mo&s;t proper time for u&s;ing the bath is the evening, when the child can be removed to bed, as &s;oon as it is completely dried.</P>
<P>There is another &s;pecies of bath, equally indi&s;pen&s;able, which I will call the <HI>Air-bath;</HI> or the daily enjoyment of fre&s;h air. This is u&s;ually con&s;idered as a promenade, or walk of plea&s;ure; and as children cannot judge of its great utility, and the weather is not always favourable for excur&s;ions, parents are &s;ometimes guilty of unpardonable neglect, in confining infants for whole days and weeks together within their rooms. But if air be e&s;&s;entially requi&s;ite to animate the mo&s;t &s;ubtle powers of man, it follows, that it is as nece&s;|&s;ary to the organs of life as food and drink; and that its &s;alutary influence on the con&s;ti|tution
<PB N="58" REF="039111_0088_10139EA7E6CE7E78">
does not &s;o much depend on the &s;tate of it with re&s;pect to plea&s;antne&s;s and &s;erenity, as on its fre&s;hne&s;s and con&s;tant renewal. Hence I would impre&s;s it on the reader, as a rule not to be departed from, <HI>to let no day elap&s;e, without affording the child an opportunity of imbibing the &s;alubrious qualities of fre&s;h air.</HI> In the fir&s;t months great precaution is nece&s;|&s;ary, and children born in &s;pring or &s;ummer have in this re&s;pect no &s;mall advantages, as there is le&s;s danger in expo&s;ing them to the open air during the warm months, than there is in autumn and winter. In the milder &s;ea|&s;ons, too, violent winds, and moi&s;t weather, cannot be too carefully avoided. After the two fir&s;t months of its exi&s;tence, if the child has been duly habituated to fre&s;h air, it may be &s;afely carried out in <HI>any</HI> &s;tate of the weath|er: this ought to be regularly done every day, if it be only for half an hour, as it is one of the mo&s;t nouri&s;hing cordials that can be given. I &s;hall ju&s;t notice here, in a cur&s;ory way, the great benefit which the eyes of chil|dren derive from this practice, and which, particularly at a time when complaints of weak and &s;ore eyes are heard in almo&s;t every family, is of the utmo&s;t importance. It is an unque&s;tionable fact, that the &s;hortne&s;s of &s;ight, and weakne&s;s of the eyes, &s;o prevalent among the inhabitants of towns, is chiefly owing to the injudicious cu&s;tom of confining children, during the fir&s;t years of their lives, almo&s;t con&s;tantly within four walls; &s;o that the eye, being accu&s;tomed to <HI>near</HI> objects only, becomes organized for a narrow view, and at length
<PB N="59" REF="039111_0089_10136E26589FFC50">
is rendered incapable of forming the focus properly for <HI>di&s;tant</HI> objects. On the other hand, it is equally certain, that by an early and daily exertion of the organs of &s;ight, in be|holding remote objects, in the open air, the circle of vi&s;ion is enlarged, the power of &s;ight increa&s;ed, and a &s;olid foundation laid for ac|quiring a clear and comprehen&s;ive di&s;cern|ment of objects.</P>
<P>From the preceding ob&s;ervations, it will be readily admitted, that the proper and daily airing of the nur&s;ery, <HI>in winter as well as in &s;ummer,</HI> is of no &s;mall importance to the well|being of children. It has been proved by many fatal in&s;tances, that a confined and im|pure air is of it&s;elf capable of exciting the mo&s;t violent convul&s;ive &s;ymptoms, and con&s;equent|ly is one of the principal cau&s;es, that &s;o many infants die of convul&s;ions, during the fir&s;t months of their lives. Would it not be more eligible, to &s;elect the mo&s;t airy apartment in the hou&s;e for a nur&s;ery, than low and con|fined garrets, as is too frequently the ca&s;e in large families? The room, in which children breathe, &s;hould at lea&s;t be capacious and lof|ty, and expo&s;ed to the cheering rays of the &s;un, which not only influence the temper and &s;pirits of children, but &s;erve to purify the corrupted air in their apartments.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons unaccu&s;tomed to reflect on this &s;ub|ject, can &s;carcely conceive, what &s;alutary ef|fects the &s;imple means here recommended, namely, the early habit of wa&s;hing, bathing, and daily airing, produce on the con&s;titution, and phy&s;ical formation of the child. The
<PB N="60" REF="039111_0090_10139EAAA7829408">
habit of body, growth, and appearance of children, properly educated in this re&s;pect, will be totally different from tho&s;e, who are reared like foreign plants in a ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">-hou&s;e. To point out &s;till more forcibly the peculiar ad|vantages attending the regimen here recom|mended, I &s;hall exhibit a picture of &s;uch chil|dren, not taken from fancy, but authorized by facts, and according with the experience of many modern ob&s;ervers, as well as my own, and that of a re&s;pectable phy&s;ician in Germany, Profe&s;&s;or Hufeland of Jena, to whom I am greatly indebted for the following ob&s;ervations:</P>
<P N="1">1. A child thus treated is more hardy and le&s;s affected by the vici&s;&s;itudes of climate and weather.</P>
<P N="2">2. Its body is &s;traight and robu&s;t; its limbs are uniformly mu&s;cular, and well propor|tioned.</P>
<P N="3">3. The &s;tages of evolution, in its different organs, take place in regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion;&mdash;no power, no capacity, out&s;trips another; its teeth do not appear too &s;oon, nor at irregular periods; the child does not begin to walk too early nor too late; and the &s;ame order is ob&s;ervable with regard to its &s;peaking. Even the mental faculties expand them&s;elves more regularly, that is, not too rapidly, but after the mo&s;t important bodily changes have been effected. Every period of its progre&s;s to ma|turity comes on in a natural and gradual manner, &s;o that the child, in a phy&s;ical &s;en&s;e, longer remains a child;&mdash;he does not &s;hoot up into manhood, before he has completed
<PB N="61" REF="039111_0091_10139EECA49474C8">
the proper term of youth; and thus every &s;tage, as well as the whole career of his ex|i&s;tence, is con&s;iderably prolonged.</P>
<P N="4">4. By this treatment the circulation of the fluids, and all internal motions, particularly of the lungs and inte&s;tines, together with the u&s;ual evacuations, are beneficially promoted. Of no le&s;s advantage is the bath to tho&s;e chil|dren, that are &s;ubject to habitual co&s;tivene&s;s; a di&s;temperature which cannot be too much guarded again&s;t, not only during the age of childhood, but al&s;o through the whole life. Infants accu&s;tomed to the bath, and fre&s;h air, are &s;carcely ever known to &s;uffer from this complaint.</P>

The complexion is lively and fre&s;h;&mdash;the head and lower belly are in ju&s;t proportion to the re&s;t of the body, and the di&s;po&s;ition to rickets, &s;o common in children, is not perceived in them.</P>

<P N="9">9. The early practice of wa&s;hing and bath|ing may be al&s;o recommended, as tending to &s;trengthen that &s;en&s;e of cleanline&s;s, which is &s;o prai&s;eworthy and u&s;eful in it&s;elf; and which is not &s;ufficiently cultivated among tho&s;e nations, where the bath is in di&s;u&s;e.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Ru&s;&s;ians, notwith&s;tanding their ignorance, and ru&s;ticity of manners, take the lead of the more relined French and Germans, both in a delicate &s;en&s;ibility of cleanline&s;s, and in the practical u&s;e of the bath. I lately read of a foreign gentleman, travelling in Ru&s;&s;ia, who had hired one of the natives as his groom or po&s;tillion. After hav|ing travelled &s;everal days together in very &s;ultry weather, the &s;emi|barbarian upon his knees reque&s;ted his employer to grant him leave of ab&s;ence for two or three hours, to refre&s;h him&s;elf with the luxury of a bath, which to him was indi&s;pen&s;able, and the want of which he had long felt. The <HI>pea&s;ants</HI> in that country po&s;&s;e&s;s a refinement of &s;en&s;e, with re&s;pect to the &s;urface of the body, with which the mo&s;t elegant <HI>ladies</HI> in other countries &s;eem totally unacquainted.</NOTE></P>
<P>If the means above &s;tated are expected to produce their full effect, it &s;hould not be for|gotten, that the <HI>whole</HI> management of the child ought to corre&s;pond and keep pace with
<PB N="63" REF="039111_0093_10139EEE2B3F3678">
the preceding practice. Without attending to this condition, con&s;tant wa&s;hing and bath|ing may not only prove of little &s;ervice, but may in &s;ome in&s;tances be productive of mi&s;|chief. Hence it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to pro|hibit the u&s;e of feather-beds, cumber&s;ome dre&s;&s;es, &amp;c. and to avoid all &s;uffocating rooms, whether occa&s;ioned by too great heat, or an offen&s;ive corrupted atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>There is no practice more detrimental to the powers and energy of man, in the fir&s;t period of his evolution, than that of immedi|ately &s;inking the tender infant in a &s;oft feath|er-bed. In this &s;ituation, all the organs be|come extremely relaxed, and we lay the foun|dation of a very &s;erious malady, a <HI>&s;weating-&s;kin;</HI> the &s;ource of con&s;tant colds, tooth-achs, head-achs, catarrhs, and innumerable other complaints.</P>
<P>For the&s;e and &s;imilar rea&s;ons, I would ad|vi&s;e parents to lay their children, from the very hour of their birth, on &s;oft and cooling mattre&s;&s;es, under thin blanket covers, or cot|ton quilts, which do not incommode the body, lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> the hands and arms at liberty, and are not liable to excite too great a degree of heat. In the inten&s;e cold of winter, an additional blanket may be u&s;ed, which, how|ever, &s;hould be removed when the weather turns milder, and the child grows &s;tronger. But the greate&s;t mi&s;chief ari&s;es from bol&s;ters or pillows filled with feathers; which mu&s;t, after a certain time, produce uncleanline&s;s and a di&s;agreeable &s;mell. Such a pillow is calcu|lated to collect and retain mephitic vapours;
<PB N="64" REF="039111_0094_10139EAFC7BC4538">
and for this obvious rea&s;on it cannot but be un&s;afe to &s;leep for a whole twelvemonth wit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> one's head repo&s;ed on &s;uch a ma&s;s of acrid ex|halations. This inconvenience may be ea&s;ily avoided, by furni&s;hing children with cu&s;hions filled with hor&s;e-hair, or with the &s;ofte&s;t bran, previou&s;ly well beaten; the be&s;t for this pur|po&s;e is the bran of oats. The great advan|tage of the&s;e pillows is, that they admit moi&s;|ture to pa&s;s through them, con&s;equently they will always remain dry; and may from time to time be renewed, while they pre&s;erve a moderate and regular degree of warmth.</P>
<P><HI>Cleanline&s;s,</HI> in dome&s;tic life, is one of the cardinal virtues, and an e&s;&s;ential requi&s;ite to the proper phy&s;ical education of children. Indeed, I cannot help remarking, that this is perhaps the <HI>only</HI> province of parental care, in which we <HI>never</HI> can do <HI>too much.</HI> For this end, we ought not to neglect the article of linen, as the frequent change of it is of more con&s;equence than many parents are aware of. A child is much more liable to per&s;pire than an adult; the natural effect of which is, that its linen is more readily &s;oiled and rendered unfit for wearing. I would therefore advi&s;e all parents, who can afford it, to give their children clean, dry linen <HI>every day.</HI> An un|doubted proof of the utility of this practice is, that in&s;tances have occurred of children being cured of the rickets, when, from the fir&s;t appearance of that complaint, they have been daily furni&s;hed with clean linen, well dried, and occa&s;ionally &s;moked with juniper|berries, frankincen&s;e, or other perfuming &s;ub|&s;tances,
<PB N="65" REF="039111_0095_10139EF0B3D73D80">
in order to expel the moi&s;ture, which is ab&s;orbed by linen. But if a clean change cannot be conveniently had every day, the night-&s;hirt as well as that of the day, ought to be regularly dried, and perfumed if nece&s;|&s;ary.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, let the dre&s;s of children be light; the head and brea&s;t during the fir&s;t months may be covered, though very &s;lightly; but as &s;oon as the hair is &s;ufficiently &s;trong to af|ford protection, there is &s;carcely any nece&s;&s;ity for hats or caps, unle&s;s in rainy or cold &s;ea|&s;ons. The brea&s;t and neck too acquire more firmne&s;s, and are rendered hardier, by keep|ing them uncovered; as our frequent colds and &s;ore throats chiefly originate from the ab&s;urd habit of wearing bo&s;om-friends and &s;tiffened cravats.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude the&s;e ob&s;ervations with an hi&s;torical account from HERODOTUS, which clearly illu&s;trates the advantage attending the cool regiment of the head. This judicious and learned writer informs us, that after the battle fought between the <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> under CAMBYSES, and the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> the &s;lain of both nations were &s;eparated: and upon ex|amining the heads of the Per&s;ians, their &s;kulls were found to be &s;o thin and tender, that a &s;mall &s;tone would immediately perforate them: while on the other hand, the heads of the Egyptians were &s;o firm, that they could &s;carcely be fractured by the large&s;t &s;tones. The cau&s;e of this remarkable difference Hero|dotus a&s;cribes to a cu&s;tom the Egyptians had of &s;having their heads from the earlie&s;t infan|cy,
<PB N="66" REF="039111_0096_10139EB14D7A8BD8">
and going uncovered in all &s;tates of the weather; whereas the Per&s;ians always kept their heads warm, by wearing heavy turbans.</P>
<P>I &s;incerely wi&s;h, that the rules and ob&s;er|vations, here &s;ubmitted to the candid reader, were more generally under&s;tood and practi|&s;ed, &s;o far at lea&s;t as they are found to accord with rea&s;on and experience. I am not how|ever di&s;po&s;ed to imagine, that plans of <HI>&s;udden</HI> improvement are the mo&s;t likely to &s;ucceed; and I am well aware of the difficulties we mu&s;t expect to encounter, when we attack old and rooted prejudices, with the hope of vanqui&s;hing them <HI>all at once.</HI> For though I &s;hould be fortunate enough to &s;ub&s;titute &s;ounder opinions and better practices, in lieu of tho&s;e already e&s;tabli&s;hed, yet, unle&s;s the mind be prepared for &s;uch changes, by a proper philo&s;ophic culture, nothing is more probable, than that a &s;peedy relap&s;e into for|mer errors will be the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence. The hi&s;tory of our own time has, in &s;ome re|cent in&s;tances, evidently confirmed the truth of this ob&s;ervation. We find even the man|dates of arbitrary power in&s;ufficient to pro|duce a thorough reform in the manners and cu&s;toms of a &s;uper&s;titious people. The phi|lanthropic but weak emperor JOSEPH II. was obliged to yield to the torrent of popular prejudice; and, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n &s;pite of his better rea&s;on, frequently to repeal mea&s;ures dictated by the enlightened genius of philo&s;ophy. His ob&s;ti|nate and infatuated &s;ubjects were not fully ripe for &s;uch &s;alutary innovations. Our age is &s;carcely docile enough to pur&s;ue tho&s;e im|provements,
<PB N="67" REF="039111_0097_10139EF46CCE2378">
which a rapid and continual pro|gre&s;s in the &s;ciences is daily &s;ugge&s;ting. Up|on this ground alone we can explain the fre|quent and obvious contra&s;t between the pre|vailing theories and practices, both in the higher and lower walks of life. A great ma|jority of the common people, from their ha|bitual indifference to literature, and their aver&s;ion to &s;erious reflection, &s;till manife&s;t their ancient prejudices to every thing which falls under the de&s;cription of novelty or im|provement. More than one generation will probably elap&s;e, before even a part of the u&s;e|ful hints can be realized, which lie di&s;per&s;ed in the later writings on &s;ubjects of health and dome&s;tic economy. Whatever benefits can be attained by popular in&s;truction, both with regard to the treatment of children and adults, mu&s;t be introduced in a gradual manner. The ancient treatment of children, being con|&s;ecrated by time, mu&s;t not be rudely and pre|cipitately rejected; but old cu&s;toms may be changed by prudent and moderate manage|ment; and thus we may proceed from one &s;tep to another, in extending the boundaries of truth and rea&s;on. A gradual tran&s;ition from a faulty to a better &s;tate of things, is commonly the mo&s;t permanent. Let us com|bat, at fir&s;t, the mo&s;t dangerous notions and prejudices: the conque&s;t over a <HI>&s;ingle</HI> preju|dice, if it be completely extirpated, is a tri|umph of no little moment; ina&s;much as it will &s;hake the foundation of many others, more or le&s;s connected with it.</P>

In my earne&s;t endeavours to caution the reader again&s;t inveterate prejudices, I do not mean to in&s;inuate, that a perfect and perma|nent &s;tate of health is compatible with the delicate organization and complex functions of the human body: I am well aware, that its mo&s;t healthy condition clo&s;ely borders on di&s;ea&s;e, and that the &s;eeds of di&s;tempers are already planted in the very fulne&s;s or luxu|riance of our fluids.

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>AS the enjoyment of 'a &s;ound mind in a &s;ound body' is one of the greate&s;t of terre&s;trial ble&s;&s;ings, it is incumbent on ev|ery rational inquirer, to devote &s;ome portion of his time and indu&s;try to the re&s;earch of &s;uch u&s;eful and practical objects, as may con|tribute to improve and in&s;ure &s;o de&s;irable a &s;tate.</P>
<P>As long as the various functions of the hu|man body, the voluntary as well as the invol|untary motions, are performed with ea&s;e, and &s;uffer no interruption, we u&s;ually pronounce the body to be in a &s;tate of health; in the contrary ca&s;e we call it di&s;ea&s;ed. I &s;hall ad|vance a &s;tep further, and a&s;&s;ert, that when we do not feel our&s;elves encumbered with the
<PB N="70" REF="039111_0100_10139F39C324E2C8">
weight of our own frame, and when we are not di&s;po&s;ed to reflect, with unea&s;ine&s;s and &s;o|licitude, upon its phy&s;ical condition, then we have a right to con&s;ider our health as being in a perfect &s;tate.</P>
<P>Although we are liable to &s;uffer from the attacks of di&s;ea&s;e, in a variety of &s;hapes, yet we have abundant rea&s;on to contemplate with &s;atisfaction the chequered condition of human life: for, even in the pre&s;ent imperfect &s;tate of things, we find comforts more than &s;uffi|cient to counterbalance our &s;orrows. Con|&s;idering the innumerable accidents, to which we are daily and hourly expo&s;ed, it is a mat|ter of ju&s;t &s;urpri&s;e, that frail, imbecile man &s;hould remain in health during the greater part of his life; and &s;till more &s;o, that, upon an average, the number of healthy individu|als &s;hould be found far to exceed tho&s;e in a contrary &s;tate. If we further advert to the want of thought and circum&s;pection, which marks the conduct of man in general, in the treatment of his body, our a&s;toni&s;hment will nece&s;&s;arily increa&s;e, that he &s;o often e&s;capes the dangers prepared by his own hands. But pa|rental Nature frequently repairs the injury, though we are not con&s;cious of her &s;alutary efforts. She powerfully co-operates, when art is called in aid, to re&s;tore that harmony and order in the &s;y&s;tem, which had been im|prudently or inadvertently di&s;turbed. To her healing powers we are principally indebt|ed, if the &s;ufferings re&s;ulting from ignorance or ob&s;tinacy are le&s;s &s;evere, than the extent of the mi&s;chief &s;eemed to portend.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="039111_0101_10139EF88D72EAB8">
It cannot be expected, that per&s;ons unac|quainted with the economy of the human frame &s;hould be able to di&s;criminate between internal and external cau&s;es, and their effects. Where a competent &s;hare of this knowledge is wanting, it will be impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain, or to counteract, the different cau&s;es by which our health is affected; and &s;hould a fortunate individual ever fix upon a &s;uitable remedy, he will be indebted to chance alone for the di&s;covery.</P>
<P>This has been the ca&s;e in all ages, and alas! it is &s;till deplorably the ca&s;e. Remedies have from time to time been devi&s;ed, not merely to &s;erve as <HI>No&s;trums for all di&s;ea&s;es,</HI> but al&s;o for the pretended purpo&s;e of <HI>prolonging human life.</HI> Tho&s;e of the latter kind have been ap|plied with a view to re&s;i&s;t or check many op|erations of nature, which in&s;en&s;ibly con&s;ume the vital heat, and other powers of life, &s;uch as re&s;piration, mu&s;cular irritability, &amp;c. Thus, from the implicit credulity of &s;ome, and the exuberant imagination of others, ob&s;ervations and experiments, however di&s;cordant with &s;ound rea&s;on and philo&s;ophy, were multiplied, with the avowed de&s;ign of e&s;tabli&s;hing proofs or refutations of this or that ab&s;urd opinion. In this manner have fanatici&s;m and impo&s;ture fal&s;ified the plaine&s;t truths, or forged the mo&s;t unfounded and ridiculous claims; &s;o that one glaring incon&s;i&s;tency was employed to combat another, and folly &s;ucceeded folly, till a fund of materials has been tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity, &s;ufficient to form a conci&s;e hi&s;tory of this &s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="039111_0102_10139F3D5CF0E7B0">
Men, in all ages, have &s;et a ju&s;t value on long life; and in proportion to the means of enjoying the &s;ame, this value has been felt in a greater or le&s;s degree. If the gratification of the &s;en&s;ual appetite formed the principal object of living, the prolongation of it would be, to the epicure, as de&s;irable, as the pro&s;pect of a life to be enjoyed beyond the limits of the grave, is to the morali&s;t and the believer.</P>
<P>In the Old Te&s;tament, the promi&s;e of a long life was held up as one of the mo&s;t im|portant &s;ources of con&s;olation: and, conform|ably to the principles of Chri&s;tianity, a patient continuance in well-doing, or, in other words, a long life rich in good works, can be&s;t in&s;ure the hope of a more happy &s;tate in a future world. Hence the wi&s;h of a &s;peedy termina|tion of our exi&s;tence here, is one of tho&s;e ec|centricities, into which only per&s;ons deprived of rea&s;on are liable to be drawn, either from extreme anxiety, or the want of mental forti|tude. The de&s;ire of longevity &s;eems to be inherent in all animal life, and particularly in human nature: it is intimately cheri&s;hed by us, throughout the whole of our exi&s;tence, and is frequently &s;upported and &s;trengthened, not only by ju&s;tifiable means, but al&s;o by va|rious &s;pecies of collu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The po&s;&s;ibility of prolonging human life was never doubted by the Orientals, even in the earlie&s;t ages. One of the mo&s;t ancient methods on record, is that of placing the aged and decrepit in the vicinity of an atmo&s;phere, replete with the exhalations of blooming youth. It is not improbable, that a certain
<PB N="73" REF="039111_0103_10139EFB519C1650">
cu&s;tom then prevailing in the Ea&s;t, by alluring the fancy with beautiful images, and by im|po&s;ing upon the under&s;tanding through poet|ical fictions, fir&s;t induced man to entertain this &s;ingular notion. The bloom of a juve|nile age, and particularly the healthful virgin, was compared, by the Orientals, with ro&s;es, lilies, and other elegant flowers; &s;he was in|troduced in allegorical de&s;cription, to repre|&s;ent odoriferous &s;pices, balms, and oils, and was made the &s;ubject of pa&s;toral and other poems. How ea&s;y, then, the tran&s;ition from fancy to belief, that the exhalations of vigor|ous and healthy per&s;ons mu&s;t be highly con|ducive to the &s;upport of exhau&s;ted age; that they were capable, like the fragrant balms of the Ea&s;t, of &s;oftening the rigidity of the fibres, of exciting the vital &s;pirits, and, in &s;hort, of &s;upplying the aged with a fre&s;h &s;tock of health. The hi&s;tory of KING DAVID furni&s;hes us with a &s;triking illu&s;tration of this renovat|ing proce&s;s.</P>
<P>In the writings of the ancient phy&s;icians, we meet with various accounts, from which we learn, that this method has ever been a favourite re&s;ource of invalids, worn out with age. Modern phy&s;icians al&s;o mention the practice, and the celebrated BOERHAAVE in|forms us, that he advi&s;ed an old and decrepit burgoma&s;ter at Am&s;terdam to &s;leep between two young per&s;ons; and that his patient, who before was &s;inking under the weight of infirmities, obviou&s;ly recovered &s;trength and cheerfulne&s;s of mind.</P>
<P>The great age of &s;ome &s;choolma&s;ters has
<PB N="74" REF="039111_0104_10139F3FEE8A1000">
likewi&s;e been a&s;cribed to the benefit they de|rive from breathing, almo&s;t con&s;tantly, among young and healthy children. It has been far|ther ob&s;erved, that young per&s;ons, if they &s;leep in company with the aged, become lean and enfeebled.&mdash;Upon more accurate inqui|ries, however, it is pretty evident, that mo&s;t of the benefits (perhaps all of them) which the aged derive from this expedient, may be placed to the account of the imagination, and its &s;urpri&s;ing effects on the body. It is this power which, in my opinion, renews the lan|gui&s;hing flame of the aged, and which may pre&s;erve them for &s;ome time longer in that renovated &s;tate, provided it be &s;upported by a proper attention to diet and other circum|&s;tances.&mdash;We frequently &s;ee a debilitated and peevi&s;h old man a&s;&s;ume a complacent &s;miling a&s;pect, when a &s;prightly maiden addre&s;&s;es him in the language of courteous plea&s;antry. The mo&s;t charming images recur to his &s;timulated imagination; and the powers of life are, as it were, again rou&s;ed, and directed to one object. That &s;uch means of reanimating old age, may have a favourable effect on health, cannot be di&s;puted.</P>
<P>To imagine, however, that the vigour of health and the bloom of youth can be trans|fu&s;ed by in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration, or exhala|tion, into the body of the aged, is to labour under a very palpable mi&s;take. I &s;hall prove, in the next Chapter "On Air and Weather," that every living being nece&s;&s;arily corrupts the air more or le&s;s by its re&s;piration; and that the atmo&s;phere, thus impregnated, be|comes
<PB N="75" REF="039111_0105_10139EFEDE129008">
unfit for other beings to breathe in; becau&s;e every expiration contains certain par|ticles, which are &s;eparated by the lungs, as be|ing u&s;ele&s;s and noxious to the body. How then is it conceivable, that matters or &s;ub|&s;tances &s;hould be hurtful to one body, if re|tained in it, and u&s;eful to another, if commu|nicated to it? Or was it &s;uppo&s;ed, that the <HI>watery parts</HI> of in&s;en&s;ible exhalation from the young body, could moi&s;ten and refre&s;h the parched fibres of the aged? To accompli&s;h this purpo&s;e, we are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of remedies much purer and more effectual. Natural warmth or heat is the only means competent to produce &s;uch a &s;alutary effect; as that alone is capable of exciting the &s;lumbering energy of life. And in this re&s;pect, I appre|hend, we ought to do ju&s;tice to the above-de|&s;cribed method practi&s;ed by the ancients.</P>
<P>When young per&s;ons live or &s;leep with old people, and are ob&s;erved to grow thin and infirm, (which however is not always the ca&s;e) that proceeds from another circum|&s;tance, namely, that the former ab&s;orb or in|hale the noxious particles of the latter; but from this it by no means follows, that the aged body attracts the vital principle from the younger. Although free <HI>caloric,</HI> or mat|ter of heat, may probably pa&s;s over from the young body into that of the aged; yet this transfu&s;ion, under certain circum&s;tances, would be rather to the advantage than di&s;ad|vantage of the former; ina&s;much as this de|privation of &s;uperfluous caloric is not unfre|quently found to be &s;erviceable and whole|&s;ome.</P>

From the preceding remarks we may con|ceive, that a &s;chool-room filled with the va|rious exhalations of children, cannot conduce to the prolongation of life; and, con&s;equent|ly, that the great age of certain &s;choolma&s;ters mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to &s;ome other cau&s;e. An accurate account of the mortality prevailing among that cla&s;s of men would &s;atisfactorily demon&s;trate, that the age of &s;choolma&s;ters is in a ju&s;t proportion to that of other cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now con&s;ider &s;everal other plans, that have been adopted for the prolongation of human life.</P>
<P>The Egyptians, who lived in a country rendered unwhole&s;ome by inten&s;e heat and frequent inundations, could not long remain ignorant of the comparative longevity of their northern neighbours, the Greeks. Af|ter many fruitle&s;s attempts to di&s;cover the true cau&s;e of their &s;hort life, and to provide the means of removing that cau&s;e, they at length became fanatical enough to imagine them&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the grand &s;ecret for prolonging life&mdash;in the con&s;tant u&s;e of &s;udo|rifics and emetics. The air of Egypt, being impregnated with aqueous and putrid parti|cles, not only checked the proce&s;s of per&s;pira|tion, but al&s;o generated various epidemic di&s;|tempers. In &s;uch ca&s;es, &s;udorific medicines were nece&s;&s;ary and proper; and even emet|ics, by exciting a forcible commotion through the whole &s;y&s;tem, not unfrequently re&s;tored the activity of the cutaneous ve&s;&s;els, and thus produced a favourable effect in tho&s;e mala|dies.
<PB N="77" REF="039111_0107_10139F016B1E73C0">
Farther, the heat of the climate in|&s;pi&s;&s;ated their fluids; this circum&s;tance, con|nected with their u&s;ual mode of life, and their crude articles of food, nece&s;&s;arily brought on an exce&s;s of bile, which overflowing the &s;tom|ach upon the lea&s;t occa&s;ion, could not fail, &s;ooner or later, to occa&s;ion very ob&s;tinate di&s;|ea&s;es. The emetics, therefore, being emi|nently qualified to evacuate the bile, would of cour&s;e obtain general reputation among the Egyptians. The&s;e and the &s;udorifics were for a long time con&s;idered as &s;pecific remedies; from their tendency to expel the matter &s;o dangerous to life; and becau&s;e in tho&s;e ages di&s;ea&s;es were con&s;idered the <HI>only</HI> enemies to longevity: the Egyptian phy&s;i|cians and philo&s;ophers not being able to di&s;|tingui&s;h between effects and their cau&s;es, the latter of which exi&s;ted in the pe&s;tilential va|pours of a hot climate.</P>
<P>Thus it became a cu&s;tom to take at lea&s;t two emetics every month; to inquire of ac|quaintances and friends, how tho&s;e medicines had operated, and to wi&s;h each other joy up|on the&s;e occa&s;ions. I need not ob&s;erve, that this &s;ingular method of prolonging life is not to be recommended as worthy of imitation; that the periodical cu&s;tom of taking medici|nal remedies renders their frequent repeti|tion nece&s;&s;ary, while it de&s;troys their occa|&s;ional efficacy; and that it therefore chiefly belongs to the department of the phy&s;ician to determine, when, and in what degree, &s;uch medicines are to be admini&s;tered.</P>
<P>The Greeks lived in a more romantic and
<PB N="78" REF="039111_0108_10139F430096E8D0">
picture&s;que country; their conceptions with regard to the &s;tructure and functions of the human frame were more correct and con|formable to nature. Their philo&s;ophers and phy&s;icians were more enlightened and le&s;s prejudiced than tho&s;e of Egypt; they were not, like the latter, under the capricious in|fluence of a wild imagination, too frequently di&s;ordered by the effects of BLACK BILE. Na|ture, di&s;played in all her charms, in the &s;ub|lime and beautiful &s;cenery of their country, every where invited them to the enjoyment of free and pure air; the effects of this on their &s;u&s;ceptible nerves, combined with an excellent &s;y&s;tem of bodily exerci&s;e, proved the be&s;t &s;pecific for counteracting the effects of time, and thus prolonging their active, healthful lives. For this great and beneficial purpo&s;e, particular methods and rules were contrived, in order to give the body the mo&s;t varied and effectual, yet gentle motions;&mdash;the&s;e athletic exerci&s;es were judiciou&s;ly adapt|ed to the different con&s;titutions, &s;ituations, and ages of life, &s;o that the &s;agacious Greeks arrived at an extraordinary degree of perfec|tion in the <HI>gymna&s;tic art.</HI></P>
<P>The great advantage of &s;uch a cour&s;e of bodily exerci&s;e cannot be di&s;puted, when we con&s;ider how many individuals in all coun|tries die prematurely from want of activity, motion, and nervous energy; though their organization may be in no re&s;pect faulty. Be&s;ides, a body inured to frequent and labo|rious exerci&s;e, will not be ea&s;ily affected by external cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;e; being &s;ecured, as
<PB N="79" REF="039111_0109_10139F02F26EF320">
it were, by a coat of mail, again&s;t the attacks of many acute di&s;orders.</P>
<P>The Greeks carried, to a &s;till greater de|gree, the &s;y&s;tem of gymna&s;tic motions. By the &s;ame method they attempted to cure di&s;|ea&s;es in their fir&s;t &s;tages, not excepting &s;uch as were already formed, and to put a &s;top to their further progre&s;s. They cau&s;ed the pa|tient to move in various po&s;itions; they ap|plied gentle friction to the whole &s;urface of the body; and u&s;ed different methods to overcome the languor of the mu&s;cles, by ex|citing and &s;timulating the mu&s;cular energy.</P>
<P>In relaxed, weakly individuals, who&s;e or|ganization is deficient in the proper degree of ten&s;ion or ela&s;ticity, this method mu&s;t be allowed to po&s;&s;e&s;s great advantages; but I do not conceive it nece&s;&s;ary to prove here, that it cannot be con&s;i&s;tently applied to <HI>all</HI> di&s;ea&s;es. It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the weary traveller can be either &s;trengthened or refre&s;hed by additional exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>The modern methods of bracing the hu|man body, &s;uch as frequent bathing in cold water, expo&s;ing the body to all the vici&s;&s;i|tudes of climate and weather, the various modes of &s;upporting bodily fatigue, as trav|elling on hor&s;eback and on foot, &amp;c. which are &s;o indi&s;criminately recommended to our a&s;piring youth, cannot in every in&s;tance for|tify and render the human frame inde&s;truc|tible:&mdash;on the contrary, <HI>all &s;uch violent efforts</HI> have a tendency to bring on the &s;ymptoms of age, at a much earlier period than it ought to appear; as the joints and mu&s;cles are there|by
<PB N="80" REF="039111_0110_10139F479AFB0F08">
rendered liable to contract an uncommon degree of &s;tiffne&s;s and rigidity.&mdash;To load ten|der youth with burthens di&s;proportionate to their age, and to impo&s;e upon them the ta&s;k of men, can never be the mo&s;t proper means of hardening and preparing them for a long and active life.</P>
<P>A di&s;tinction, however, &s;hould be made here, between bracing the <HI>fibres,</HI> of which all &s;olid parts of the body con&s;i&s;t, and bracing the &s;en&s;e of <HI>touch</HI> or <HI>feeling.</HI> The animal fi|bres may be &s;olid, but &s;hould not be &s;o rigid as to become in&s;en&s;ible; a certain degree of irritability is nece&s;&s;ary to the proper exerci&s;e of their contracting and relaxing power. If, further, there &s;hould exi&s;t in the body a di&s;|po&s;ition towards rigidity and in&s;en&s;ibility, any artificial modes of bracing it will be of dangerous tendency. If, on the contrary, the fibres &s;hould be too irritable, the Grecian method may, in that ca&s;e, be re&s;orted to with &s;afety and advantage. A &s;triking in&s;tance of this occurs in the hi&s;tory of Captain Cook. On his arrival in the Friendly I&s;lands, he was &s;eized with an acute rheumati&s;m, attended with excruciating pains. He was &s;oon reliev|ed from this torturing &s;ituation, by the ea&s;y and in&s;tinctive proce&s;s of gentle friction, which the I&s;landers generally followed on &s;uch occa&s;ions. Thus a few untutored per|&s;ons completely effected what could not have been &s;ooner, nor more ea&s;ily accompli&s;hed by the &s;y&s;tematic art of the learned.</P>
<P>From the&s;e con&s;iderations we may &s;afely infer, 1. That the cold bath, gymna&s;tic exer|ci&s;es,
<PB N="81" REF="039111_0111_10139F059175E4F8">
bodily fatigue of any kind, and all ex|pedients to brace and invigorate the con&s;ti|tutions, ought only to be adopted under cer|tain limitations, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> with a proper regard to particular ca&s;es and circum&s;tances: and, 2. That the&s;e &s;evere remedies cannot and ought not to be univer&s;ally nor indi&s;criminately recommended, as methods of prolonging life.</P>
<P>Let us not, however, di&s;parage the merits of that ingenious race of men, whom we only know from their inimitable works. For, al|though the method of the Greeks cannot be &s;afely introduced among us, without many and great exceptions, we mu&s;t do them the ju&s;tice to allow, that in their operations of hardening the human body, they proceeded in a more cautious, gradual, and judicious manner, than the moderns &s;eem willing to &s;ubmit to. Sudden changes of any kind pro|duce a &s;ort of revolution in the body, and this is nece&s;&s;arily attended with a wa&s;te of &s;trength, proportionate to the violence of the &s;hock.</P>
<P><HI>Plutarch</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed clear and rational ideas on the &s;ubject of pre&s;erving and prolonging human life; the truth of which he confirm|ed by his own experience, during a &s;eries of many happy years. He advi&s;es to keep the head cool and the feet warm, not immediate|ly to take medicines on every &s;light indi&s;po|&s;ition, but rather to let Nature relieve her&s;elf by fa&s;ting a day, and, in attending to the mind, never to forget the body. Much learning is compre&s;&s;ed in the&s;e golden pre|cepts, which will be valuable as long as hu|man
<PB N="82" REF="039111_0112_10139F4A3414FE18">
nature remains the &s;ame. The atten|tion be&s;towed upon the mind, however lau|dable, &s;hould not authori&s;e us to neglect the care of the body; the intimate connexion &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between both requires a due pro|portion of care and attention to be paid to each. In the &s;ame degree, as a di&s;ea&s;ed body &s;ympathetically torments the mind, &s;o does an infirm mind agitate and hara&s;s the body; and &s;uch tortures and reciprocal affections are unavoidably attended with the con&s;umption of animal life.&mdash;What Plutarch enjoins, with re&s;pect to keeping the head cool and the feet warm, is agreeable to rea&s;on and experience; we &s;hould not, however, imagine, that the grand &s;ecret of prolonging life con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;ole ob&s;ervance of the&s;e maxims. The head and feet are not the only points, in which life is concentrated; they may indeed have a beneficial or pernicious influence on the whole body, and in this re&s;pect they demand a &s;hore of our attention; but no other part ought on that account to e&s;cape our notice.</P>
<P>I now enter upon a very unplea&s;ant ta&s;k, namely, that of reviewing a period of dark|ne&s;s, during the barbarity of the middle ages, when the progre&s;s of true knowledge was ob&s;tructed by the mo&s;t ab&s;urd fancies and childi&s;h conceits; when conjectures, caprices and dreams &s;upplied the place of the mo&s;t u&s;eful &s;ciences, of the mo&s;t important truths. Chemi&s;try, &s;o e&s;&s;entially requi&s;ite to explain the phenomena of known and unknown &s;ub|&s;tances, fell into the hands of jugglers and fa|natics;&mdash;their &s;y&s;tems, replete with philo|&s;ophic
<PB N="83" REF="039111_0113_10139F0927DA4D10">
non&s;en&s;e, and compo&s;ed of the mo&s;t crude, heterogeneous materials, &s;erved rather to nouri&s;h &s;uper&s;tition than to e&s;tabli&s;h facts and illu&s;trate u&s;eful truths. Univer&s;al rem|edies, in various forms, met with &s;trenuous advocates and deluded con&s;umers. The path of accurate ob&s;ervation and experiment was for&s;aken; far from penetrating into the my&s;|terious rece&s;&s;es of Nature, they bewildered them&s;elves in the labyrinth of fanciful &s;pecu|lation; they over&s;tepped the bounds of good &s;en&s;e, mode&s;ty, and truth, and the blind led the blind.</P>
<P>The prolongation of life, too, was no longer &s;ought for in a manner agreeable to the dic|tates of Nature; even this intere&s;ting branch of human pur&s;uits was rendered &s;ub&s;ervient to Chemi&s;try, or rather to the confu&s;ed &s;y&s;|tem of Alchemy. <HI>Original matter</HI> was looked upon to be the elementary cau&s;e of all beings; by this they expected literally to work mira|cles, to tran&s;mute the ba&s;e into noble metals, to metamorpho&s;e man in his animal &s;tate by chemical proce&s;s, to render him more dura|ble, and to &s;ecure him again&s;t early decline and di&s;&s;olution. Millions of ve&s;&s;els, retorts, and phials were either expo&s;ed to the action of the mo&s;t violent artificial heat, or to the natural warmth of the &s;un; or el&s;e they were buried in &s;ome dunghill, or other fetid ma&s;s, for the purpo&s;e of apprehending this <HI>original matter,</HI> or obtaining it from putre&s;cible &s;ub|&s;tances.</P>
<P>As the &s;ub&s;tance called Gold always bore the highe&s;t value among metals, the&s;e mon|grel
<PB N="84" REF="039111_0114_10139F4BB9584470">
philo&s;ophers concluded, from a ridicu|lous analogy, that its value, with re&s;pect to the pre&s;ervation of health, and the cure of di&s;ea&s;es, mu&s;t likewi&s;e &s;urpa&s;s that of all oth|er remedies. The nugatory art of di&s;&s;olv|ing it, &s;o as to render it potable, and to pre|vent it from being again converted into met|al, employed a multitude of bu&s;y idiots, not only in concealed corners, but in the &s;plendid laboratories of the palaces of the great. Sov|ereigns, magi&s;trates, coun&s;ellors, and impo&s;|tors, were &s;truck with the common frenzy, entered into friend&s;hip and alliance, formed private fraternities, and &s;ometimes proceeded to &s;uch a pitch of extravagance, as to involve them&s;elves and their po&s;terity in ruinous debts. The real object of many was, doubt|le&s;s, to gratify their avarice and de&s;ire of ag|grandi&s;ement, although this &s;ini&s;ter motive was concealed under the &s;pecious pretext of &s;earch|ing for a remedy, that &s;hould &s;erve as a tinc|ture of life, both for the healthy and di&s;ea&s;ed; yet &s;ome among the&s;e whim&s;ical mortals were actuated by more honourable motives, zealous only for the intere&s;ts of truth, and the well|being of their fellow-creatures. The com|mon people in &s;ome countries, particularly Italy, Germany, and France, often denied them&s;elves the nece&s;&s;aries of life, to &s;ave as much as would purcha&s;e a few drops of the tincture of gold, which was offered for &s;ale by &s;ome &s;uper&s;titious or fraudulent chemi&s;t: and &s;o thoroughly per&s;uaded were they of the efficacy of this remedy, that it afforded them in every in&s;tance the mo&s;t confident and
<PB N="85" REF="039111_0115_10139F0AAEB8D4A8">
only hope of recovery. The&s;e beneficial ef|fects were po&s;itively promi&s;ed, but were look|ed for in vain. All-&s;ubduing Death would not &s;ubmit to be bribed with gold, and Di&s;|ea&s;e refu&s;ed to hold any intercour&s;e with that powerful deity, who pre&s;ides over the trade and commerce of nations.</P>
<P>As, however, the&s;e diver&s;ified and almo&s;t numberle&s;s experiments were frequently pro|ductive of u&s;eful inventions in the arts and manufactures; and as many chemical reme|dies of real value were thereby accidentally di&s;covered, the great and general attention to tho&s;e bold projectors, was con&s;tantly kept alive and excited. Indeed, we are indebted to their curious operations, or rather perhaps to chance, for &s;everal valuable medicines, the excellence of which cannot be di&s;puted, but which, neverthele&s;s, require more precaution in their u&s;e and application, and more per&s;pi|cacity and diligence in inve&s;tigating their na|ture and properties, than the original prepar|ers of &s;uch articles were able or willing to af|ford.</P>
<P>All their endeavours to prolong life, by artificial means, could not be attended with beneficial effects; and the application of the remedies thus contrived, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, in many ca&s;es, prove detrimental to the health of the patient. In proof of this a&s;&s;ertion, it will be &s;ufficient to give a &s;light &s;ketch of the different views and opinions of the Goldma|kers, Ro&s;encrucians, manufacturers of A&s;tra|lian Salts, of the Drops of Life, and Tinctures of Gold, hunters after the Philo&s;opher's Stone,
<PB N="86" REF="039111_0116_10139F4D4AE22200">
&amp;c. &amp;c. Some of the&s;e enthu&s;ia&s;ts fancied life to re&s;emble a flame, from which the body derived warmth, &s;pirit, and animation. This flame they endeavoured to cheri&s;h and to in|crea&s;e by their remedies, &s;upplying the body with materials to feed the &s;ame, as we pour oil into a burning lamp.</P>
<P>Others imagined they had di&s;covered &s;ome|thing invi&s;ible and incorporeal in the air, that important medium in &s;upporting the life of man. They pretended to catch, to refine, and &s;o to reduce and <HI>materialize</HI> this undefin|able &s;omething, that it might be &s;wallowed in the form of powders or drops; that by its penetrating powers it might in&s;inuate it&s;elf into the whole animal frame, invigorating and qualifying it for a longer and healthier duration than u&s;ual.</P>
<P>Others again were fooli&s;h enough to cher|i&s;h a notion, that they could dive&s;t them&s;elves of the properties of matter during this life; that in this manner they might be defended again&s;t the gradual approaches of di&s;&s;olution, to which every animal body is &s;ubject; and that thus fortified, without quitting their ter|re&s;trial tabernacle, they could a&s;&s;ociate at plea&s;ure with the inhabitants of the &s;piritual world.</P>
<P>The Sacred Volume it&s;elf was interpreted and commented upon by the Operators and Alchemi&s;ts, with a view to render it &s;ub&s;er|vient to their intere&s;ted de&s;igns. Indi&s;putable hi&s;torical facts, recorded in this invaluable book, were treated by them as hieroglyphical &s;ymbols, which contained chemical proce&s;&s;es:
<PB N="87" REF="039111_0117_10139F0D4047DE70">
and the fundamental truths of the Chri&s;tian religion were applied, in a wanton and bla&s;|phemous manner, to the purpo&s;es of making Gold, and di&s;tilling the Elixir of Life.</P>
<P>The productions of Alchemy, far from an|&s;wering the purpo&s;e of prolonging life, have rather a contrary tendency. All the remedies which it affords, are of a heating and &s;timu|lating nature. The per&s;on who takes them will feel him&s;elf more cheerful for &s;ome time, and on that account he may fancy him&s;elf more vigorous and juvenile; as they certain|ly give an additional impul&s;e to the &s;en&s;ations of life, like wine, &s;pirits, and all other &s;tim|ulants. But this increa&s;e of the <HI>&s;en&s;ation of life</HI> &s;hould by no means be confounded with an increa&s;e of the <HI>power of life.</HI> It may be even &s;afely affirmed, that by the increa&s;e of vital &s;en&s;ations, the career of life it&s;elf is ac|celerated, and the con&s;umption of it &s;ooner exhau&s;ted; con&s;equently the duration of the body is nece&s;&s;arily &s;hortened.</P>
<P>I &s;hould not omit to mention, that the&s;e remedies &s;trongly increa&s;e the &s;en&s;itive power of man, they predi&s;po&s;e him to &s;en&s;ual pur|&s;uits, &s;timulate him to commit exce&s;&s;es of every kind, incite him to take continual or exce&s;&s;ive exerci&s;e, as dancing, and the like, and thus by inevitable con&s;equence ha&s;ten the wa&s;te and di&s;&s;olution of the body. That, for in&s;tance, which, according to the natural cour&s;e, ought to be expended or con&s;umed in three days, is di&s;&s;ipated perhaps in as many jovial hours. This premature lo&s;s is attend|ed with relaxation, irk&s;omene&s;s, and even
<PB N="88" REF="039111_0118_10139F528D510EC0">
aver&s;ion to life, till a new do&s;e of &s;timulants reproduces the former fal&s;e vivacity. It fares with the patient here, as it does with the hard drinker, who trembles in the morning that follows his nightly debauch, feels his whole frame relaxed, inactive and torpid, and is in a manner obliged to take a fre&s;h dram of his favourite liquor, before he can enter on any &s;erious bu&s;ine&s;s, with plea&s;ure or effect.</P>
<P>The&s;e famous e&s;&s;ences, balms, tinctures of life, &amp;c. are farther dangerous, as they con|tract the &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;ervation of life, as well as to the repara|tion of the lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained, and thus render them unfit to perform their offices. Hence ari&s;e rigidity or &s;tiffne&s;s, and ex&s;iccation; the body &s;hrivels, and the &s;ymptoms of old age appear at an earlier period than they would otherwi&s;e have done. Man is &s;eldom un|provided with the &s;upplies of vitality;&mdash;every draught of air we inhale, and every particle of food we &s;wallow, is a fre&s;h acce&s;&s;ion to the &s;tock of life. But as &s;oon as the <HI>&s;u&s;ceptibility</HI> or <HI>power of receiving</HI> tho&s;e &s;upplies becomes languid, we then may be con&s;idered as unfit to perform the functions of life; and all the medicaments of nature and art will be found in&s;ufficient to relieve us. He who &s;earches for the &s;upplies of life in alchemical produc|tions, elixirs, bal&s;amic e&s;&s;ences, &amp;c. will &s;oon|er or later, but always prematurely, experi|ence the want of &s;u&s;ceptibility. Even that impudent boa&s;ter and celebrated <HI>in&s;urer of lives,</HI> THEOPHRASTUS PARACELSUS, although he pretended to have in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion the
<PB N="89" REF="039111_0119_10139F0FD0622B08">
&s;tone of immortality, died&mdash;in his fiftieth year! His vegetable &s;ulphur was a heating and &s;timulating remedy, partly &s;imilar to the Anodyne Liquor of Hoffmann.</P>
<P>The world of &s;pirits al&s;o was invaded, and &s;ummoned, as it were, to contribute to the prolongation of human life. Spirits were &s;uppo&s;ed to have the rule of air, fire, earth, and water; they were divided into particu|lar cla&s;&s;es, and particular &s;ervices a&s;cribed to each. The malevolent &s;pirits were oppo&s;ed and counteracted by various means of pre|vention: the good and tutelary were oblig|ed to &s;ubmit to a &s;ort of gentle, involuntary &s;ervitude. From invi&s;ible beings were ex|pected and demanded vi&s;ible means of a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance&mdash;riches&mdash;health&mdash;friends&mdash;and long life. Thus the poor &s;pirits were profanely mal|treated, nay they were &s;ometimes puni&s;hed, and even mi&s;erably flogged in effigy, when they betrayed &s;ymptoms of di&s;affection, or want of implicit loyalty.</P>
<P>As men had thus, in their weakne&s;s and folly, for&s;aken the bounds of this terre&s;trial &s;phere, it will ea&s;ily be believed, that with the help of an exuberant imagination, they would make a tran&s;ition to the higher re|gions&mdash;to the cele&s;tial bodies and the &s;tars, to which indeed they a&s;cribed no le&s;s a power than that of deciding the de&s;tinies of men, and which, con&s;equently, mu&s;t have had a con&s;iderable &s;hare in &s;hortening or prolonging the duration of human life. Every nation or kingdom was &s;ubjected to the dominion of its particular planet, the time of who&s;e

government was determined; and a number of a&s;cendant powers were fictitiou&s;ly con|trived, with a view to reduce under its in|fluence every thing which was produced and born during its admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>The profe&s;&s;ors of a&s;trology appeared as the confidants of the&s;e invi&s;ible rulers, and the interpreters of their will; they very well un|der&s;tood the art of giving a re&s;pectable ap|pearance to this u&s;urped dignity. Provided they could but a&s;certain the hour and minute of a per&s;on's birth, they confidently took up|on them&s;elves to predict his mental capacities, future vici&s;&s;itudes of life, di&s;ea&s;es, together with the circum&s;tances, the day, and the hour of his death. Not only the common people, or the le&s;s informed cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety, but the mo&s;t re&s;pectable men for learning and abilities, nay even tho&s;e of the highe&s;t rank and &s;tation, did homage to tho&s;e "gods of their idolatry," and lived in continual dread of their occult powers. With anxious coun|tenances and attentive ears, they li&s;tened to the effu&s;ions of tho&s;e &s;elf-appointed oracles, which progno&s;ticated the bright or gloomy days of futurity. Even phy&s;icians were &s;o|licitous to qualify them&s;elves for an appoint|ment no le&s;s lucrative than re&s;pectable:&mdash;they forgot, over the dazzling hoards of Mam|mon, <HI>that they were peculiarly and profe&s;&s;edly the pupils of Nature.</HI> The curious &s;tudent in the Univer&s;ities found every where public Lecturers, who undertook to in&s;truct him in the profound arts of divination, chiromancy, and the famous <HI>cabala.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="039111_0121_10139F135FF52AE8">
Not to mention other in&s;tances, I &s;hall cite that of the noted <HI>Thurnei&s;en,</HI> in the la&s;t century, who was inve&s;ted at Berlin with the re&s;pective offices of Printer to the Court, Book&s;eller, Al|manack-maker, A&s;trologer, Chemi&s;t, and Fir&s;t Phy&s;ician. Me&s;&s;engers daily arrived from the mo&s;t re&s;pectable hou&s;es in Germany, Poland, Hungary, Denmark, and even from England, for the purpo&s;e of con&s;ulting him re&s;pecting the future fortunes of new-born infants, ac|quainting him with the hour of their nativity, and &s;oliciting his advice and directions as to their management. Many volumes of this &s;ingular corre&s;pondence are &s;till pre&s;erved in the Royal Library at Berlin. The bu&s;ine&s;s of this fortunate adept increa&s;ed &s;o rapidly, that he found it nece&s;&s;ary to employ a num|ber of &s;ubaltern a&s;&s;i&s;tants, who, together with their ma&s;ter, realized con&s;iderable fortunes. He died in high reputation and favour with his &s;uper&s;titious cotemporaries; and Thur|nei&s;en's A&s;trological Almanack is yet publi&s;h|ed in &s;ome of the le&s;s enlightened provinces of Germany. But it may be a&s;ked, how it hap|pens, that an art which determines the fate of mortals, and a&s;certains the impa&s;&s;able lim|its of human life, can at the &s;ame time &s;erve as the means of prolonging it? This I &s;hall now proceed to account for. The teachers of divination maintained, that not only men, but all natural bodies, plants, animals, nay whole countries, including every individual place and family, were under the government of &s;ome particular planet. As &s;oon as the ma&s;ters of the OCCULT SCIENCE had di&s;cov|ered,
<PB N="92" REF="039111_0122_10139F56B3F748A0">
by their tables, under what con&s;tellation the misfortune or di&s;temper of any per&s;on originated, nothing further was required, than that he &s;hould remove to a dwelling ruled by an oppo&s;ite planet, and confine him|&s;elf exclu&s;ively to &s;uch articles of food and drink, as were under the influence of a dif|ferent &s;tar. In this artificial manner; they contrived to form a &s;y&s;tem, or peculiar cla&s;|&s;ification of plants, namely, lunar, &s;olar, mer|curial, and the like&mdash;and hence aro&s;e a con|fu&s;ed ma&s;s of dietetic rules, which, when con|&s;idered with reference to the purpo&s;es of health, cleanline&s;s, exerci&s;e, &amp;c. form a re|markable contra&s;t to tho&s;e of the Greeks.</P>
<P>Neither was this preventive and repelling method confined merely to per&s;ons &s;uffering under &s;ome bodily di&s;order. In the ca&s;e of individuals who enjoyed a good &s;tate of health, if an unlucky con&s;tellation happened to forebode a &s;evere di&s;ea&s;e, or any other misfortune, they were directed to choo&s;e a place of re&s;idence influenced by a more friend|ly &s;tar; or to make u&s;e of &s;uch aliment only as, being under the au&s;pices of a propitious &s;tar, might counteract the malignant influ|ence of its adver&s;ary.</P>
<P>It was al&s;o pretty generally believed and maintained, that a &s;ort of intimate relation or &s;ympathy &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between metals and plants; hence the names of the latter were given to the former, in order to denote this &s;uppo&s;ed connexion and affinity. The corre&s;ponding metals were melted into a common ma&s;s, un|der a certain planet, and were formed into
<PB N="93" REF="039111_0123_10139F15F265CB60">
&s;mall medals or coins, in hopes, and with the firm per&s;ua&s;ion, that he who carried &s;uch a piece about his per&s;on, might confidently ex|pect the whole favour and protection of the planet thus repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>The tran&s;ition from one degree of folly to another is ea&s;y; and this may help us to ac|count for the &s;hocking delu&s;ions practi&s;ed in the manufacturing and wearing of metallic amulets of a peculiar mould, to which were attributed, by a &s;ort of magic influence, the power and protection of the planet, to whom they related: the&s;e charms were thought to po&s;&s;e&s;s virtue &s;ufficient to overrule the bad effects pre&s;aged by an unlucky hour of birth, to promote to places of honour and profit, and to be of potent efficacy in matters of commerce and matrimony. The German &s;oldiers, in the dark and &s;uper&s;titious ages, believed, that if the figure of Mars, ca&s;t and en|graved in the &s;ign of the Scorpion, were worn about the neck as an amulet, it would render them invulnerable, and in&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s to their military enterprizes: hence amulets were found upon every &s;oldier, either killed in bat|tle or taken pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>But let us quit a &s;ubject which excites di&s;|gu&s;t, as it exhibits &s;uch glaring deviations from rea&s;on and truth. It is much more plea&s;ant to dwell upon examples, which af|ford &s;atisfactory proof, that the human mind has never been <HI>entirely and univer&s;ally</HI> deba&s;ed, and that there have always exi&s;ted &s;ome in|dividuals, though few in number, who would not &s;ubmit their necks to the yoke of popu|lar

prejudice, and who&s;e &s;uperior talents and virtues re&s;cued them from the impo&s;itions of general folly or depravity. A memorable in|&s;tance of this rare merit is to be found in the noble Venetian LEWIS CORNARO, who&s;e hi&s;|tory illu&s;trates this agreeable and in&s;tructive truth, that nature, left to her&s;elf, or, in other words, a property cho&s;en mode of life and di|et, regularly per&s;i&s;ted in, will achieve great things; and that a frame, di&s;ordered and even reduced to a &s;tate bordering on the grave, may yet be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, and pre&s;erve its health and vigour for a great number of years.</P>
<P>Cornaro had been a profe&s;&s;ed epicure and libertine, till he entered into the fortieth year of his age. His con&s;titution was &s;o far reduced by the colic, rheumatic pains, fevers, &amp;c. that his phy&s;icians at length gave him up, a&s;&s;uring him he could not &s;urvive much longer than two months; that no medicines whatever could avert this cata&s;trophe, and that the only po&s;&s;ible means of pre&s;erving his life would be a regular adherence to a frugal diet. He punctually followed this advice, perceived &s;ymptoms of convale&s;cence within a few days after entering on his plan of ref|ormation, and, after the lap&s;e of twelve months, was not only completely re&s;tored, but found him&s;elf in a better &s;tate of health than he had ever been during any period of his life. He re&s;olved therefore to confine him&s;elf to a &s;till more par&s;imonious regimen, and to take nothing more than what he judg|ed to be ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite for his &s;upport.
<PB N="95" REF="039111_0125_10139F1776BD0020">
Thus, during <HI>&s;ixty</HI> years, he confined him&s;elf to exactly twelve ounces of food a day, (bread and other nouri&s;hment included) with thir|teen ounces of beverage. It &s;hould be al&s;o ob&s;erved, that during this long period he carefully avoided violent heat, cold, pa&s;&s;ions, and extremes of every kind; and by rigidly and uniformly adhering to this moderate diet, not only his body, but his mind al&s;o, acquired &s;o determined a tone, that no com|mon incidents could affect them. At a very advanced age he lo&s;t a law-&s;uit, which involv|ed pecuniary concerns of great importance, and on account of which two of his brothers died of broken hearts; but he &s;till retained his pri&s;tine health and tranquillity. His car|riage happening on &s;ome occa&s;ion to be over|&s;et, he was dragged by the hor&s;es, in con&s;e|quence of which his arms and legs were di&s;|located. He cau&s;ed them, however, to be reduced again, and, without taking any med|icines, we find him in a &s;hort time re&s;tored.</P>
<P>A &s;triking in&s;tance of the dangerous ef|fects likely to attend the &s;lighte&s;t deviation from long cu&s;tom and habit, is the following: When Cornaro had reached his eightieth year, his friends prevailed upon him to add a &s;mall portion to his daily quantum of food; alleging that his advanced age nece&s;|&s;arily called for additional &s;upport. Although he was not convinced by this argument, be|ing of opinion, that, with the general decrea&s;e of &s;trength, our powers of dige&s;tion are like|wi&s;e impaired, and that we ought to dimin|i&s;h rather than to increa&s;e our food, in pro|portion
<PB N="96" REF="039111_0126_10139F5D29C9DC58">
to the decay of nature; yet he yield|ed to the &s;olicitations of his friends, and in|crea&s;ed his food from twelve to fourteen, and his drink from thirteen to &s;ixteen ounces. "Scarcely," to quote the words of our die|tetic veteran, "had I proceeded in this alter|ed mode of living for ten days, before I found my &s;pirits vi&s;ibly affected; a fretful, peevi&s;h temper &s;ucceeded to my former cheer|fulne&s;s and gaiety, &s;o that I became a burden to my&s;elf and others. This change of tem|per was followed by other &s;ymptoms &s;till more alarming. On the twelfth day, I was attacked with a pain in my &s;ide, which con|tinued for twenty-four hours together, and &s;oon after found my&s;elf oppre&s;&s;ed by a fever that raged with unabating fury for thirty-five days, &s;o that my life was at times de&s;paired of. By the ble&s;&s;ing of God, however, on re|turning to my former regimen, I recovered from this &s;hock, and now enjoy, in my eigh|ty-third year, perfect health of body and &s;e|renity of mind. I can mount my hor&s;e with|out a&s;&s;i&s;tance; I can climb &s;teep precipices, and but lately I wrote a comedy, abounding with traits of innocent mirth and raillery. When I return home, after being engaged in my private affairs, or from attending the councils of &s;tate, I feel inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;atisfac|tion in the company of my grandchildren, eleven in number, who&s;e education, amu&s;e|ment, and &s;ongs, are the comfort of my age. I frequently join them in &s;inging, as my voice is now &s;tronger and clearer than I ever knew it to be in my youth, and as my happine&s;s is
<PB N="97" REF="039111_0127_10139F1915AF73E0">
not di&s;turbed by the complaints, the moro&s;e|ne&s;s, and di&s;contented humours, &s;o frequent|ly the lot of intemperate old age."</P>
<P>In this happy frame of body and mind, Cornaro attained to his hundredth year; his virtuous and memorable example, however, has hitherto had but few followers. He found by <HI>actual ob&s;ervation</HI> and <HI>experience,</HI> that a &s;trict and uniform regimen, or a regular daily allowance of food and drink, a&s;certained by weight, was the be&s;t method <HI>he</HI> could pur|&s;ue, for the purpo&s;e of prolonging his life. He did not wi&s;h however to be under&s;tood, nor does it follow in general, that this or any other preci&s;e portion of nutriment is to be held out as a proper &s;tandard, by which <HI>all per&s;ons</HI> are to regulate their diet. His advice, that we &s;hould take no more food than what is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to our &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, may be thus explained; namely, that the re&s;tora|tion of &s;trength, derived from &s;upplies of nu|triment, ought to bear an exact proportion to the lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained by the body. He, for in|&s;tance, who &s;pends little of his time in bed, and much in the open air, takes frequent ex|erci&s;e, is con&s;tantly employed in &s;ome labo|rious occupation, makes long journies on foot or hor&s;eback, or the like, will feel him&s;elf re|fre&s;hed and &s;trengthened after partaking of a plentiful meal, and cheering beverage; and &s;uch a repa&s;t is even indi&s;pen&s;able to him, to recruit the &s;ources of his mu&s;cular &s;trength and activity. If, on the other hand, a per&s;on who lounges away half of his time in bed, or upon the &s;ofa, were to con&s;ume a quantity of
<PB N="98" REF="039111_0128_10139F5EAFB808B0">
food equal to the former, he would no doubt feel him&s;elf heavy and uncomfortable. Yet here too, the con&s;equent lo&s;s of &s;trength may vary in degree, in different &s;edentary per&s;ons; and this circum&s;tance will afford me an op|portunity, in the &s;equel, to apply to individ|ual ca&s;es the doctrine &s;ugge&s;ted by the expe|rience of Cornaro.</P>
<P>There was another period, during which <HI>blood-letting</HI> came into general u&s;e, and obtain|ed great credit, as one of the mo&s;t effectual means of prolonging life: the &s;uperfluity and vitiated &s;tate of the blood, or what phy&s;icians term a <HI>plethoric habit,</HI> being looked upon, at the &s;ame time, as a principal means of &s;hort|ening life. Through the veins thus regular|ly opened, at certain &s;ea&s;ons, the &s;uperfluous or vitiated blood was &s;uppo&s;ed to be emitted, while that of a more &s;alubrious quality was left behind. Con&s;idered as a medical reme|dy, phlebotomy mu&s;t certainly be allowed to po&s;&s;e&s;s its u&s;es, and it is &s;ometimes a nece&s;&s;ary expedient, to produce an immediate diminu|tion in the fulne&s;s of the blood, particularly when the time is too &s;hort, and the danger too pre&s;&s;ing, to admit of any other method for effecting that purpo&s;e. As there can be no doubt, that blood-letting is an invaluable remedy in many di&s;orders, it is the more pe|culiarly incumbent on the practical phy&s;ician, to di&s;tingui&s;h with care tho&s;e ca&s;es, in which imminent danger may be averted, and health re&s;tored by the u&s;e of it. I am of opinion, that there are two ca&s;es, and only two, in which vene&s;ection is likely to be attended
<PB N="99" REF="039111_0129_10139F1DB7C1E918">
with real advantage; 1&s;t, When it is requir|ed to prevent the fluids gaining acce&s;s to the parts more e&s;&s;ential to life; and, 2dly, Where means mu&s;t be &s;peedily u&s;ed, to counteract a threatened inflammation in the inte&s;tines. But, even in the&s;e two ca&s;es, the intelligent phy&s;ician is at no lo&s;s for other remedies, which may be frequently admini&s;tered with a greater probability of &s;ucce&s;s. In the treat|ment of every di&s;order, it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ingle out that remedy, which is found mo&s;t &s;uitable to the &s;tage of the complaint. And here we have no occa&s;ion to &s;tart the que&s;tion, Whether the method and the means, by which the di&s;ea&s;e is checked and health re&s;tored, are, in the end, be&s;t calculated to prolong the life of the patient? Phy&s;icians profe&s;&s;ionally look upon every di&s;ea&s;e as an evil, which cannot be too &s;peedily removed; and it would be to hazard the recovery of their patients, in ma|ny ca&s;es, were they to wa&s;te time in reflecting upon the con&s;equences of the remedy with re&s;pect to its influence on the duration of life. Hence the art of prolonging life, &s;trictly &s;peaking, is not a di&s;tinct branch of medicine, but rather forms a &s;eparate art, and as &s;uch is the common property of all: it &s;hould therefore con&s;titute a part of the education and &s;tudies of every rational individual, what|ever be his other engagements and occupa|tions. The ab&s;urd notion, that blood-letting is u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary to the prolongation of human life, is &s;till pretty generally received among the common people of all countries. Neither the <HI>good</HI> nor the <HI>bad</HI> days, &s;uper&s;ti|tiou&s;ly

marked in the almanacks for amu&s;ing the vulgar, can palliate or ju&s;tify the mi&s;|chiefs, with which this dangerous error is pregnant. Bleeding can be of &s;ervice only, when it is performed at a proper time; and to expre&s;s my opinion of it, in a few words, <HI>it is always noxious to the healthy.</HI></P>
<P>The blood contains and affords to the bones, ligaments, tendons, membranes, mu&s;|cles, nerves, ve&s;&s;els, in &s;hort, to the whole or|ganized body, all the parts, which form the bones, ligaments, tendons, &amp;c. Each of the&s;e parts is evolved from the blood, and adapted to its proper place, in &s;o artificial a manner, that the human mind is totally at a lo&s;s to comprehend, how this operation is perform|ed; neither have the re&s;earches of the mo&s;t acute and attentive ob&s;ervers been able to ac|count for it. And as the blood &s;erves to re|pleni&s;h the diminution, and to make up the lo&s;&s;es, which tho&s;e parts occa&s;ionally &s;u&s;tain, it may be con&s;idered as the original &s;ource of our whole organization. By its &s;timulating powers it al&s;o cau&s;es the heart and the arte|ries to contract; and by that means pre&s;erves the circulating motion, by which it is pro|pelled through all the parts of the body, for the purpo&s;es de&s;igned by nature.</P>
<P>Now, it requires little reflection to perceive, that he who wa&s;tes this vital fluid, thereby ob&s;tructs, and, as it were, cuts off the &s;ources of his &s;upport and regeneration. And though it be true, that the blood evacuated by pe|riodical bleedings is &s;oon re-produced by the activity of the vital powers, yet this re&s;tora|tion
<PB N="101" REF="039111_0131_10139F1F42BA8C20">
is not effected without con&s;iderable ef|forts, and at the expen&s;e of the whole ma|chine. As this exertion, therefore, is a great pre&s;&s;ure upon the vital powers, it mu&s;t of cour&s;e be attended with a proportionate de|gree of their con&s;umption. It is too well known, that the corrupted part of the blood cannot be &s;eparated from the ma&s;s, &s;o that the &s;ound and uncorrupted particles alone may remain behind. If the quality of the blood ever become vitiated and di&s;ea&s;ed; if it be too thick and vi&s;cous, or too acrid, and di&s;&s;olved, the whole ma&s;s participates in the infectious taint; neither is it in the power of art, to contrive any method, by which the corrupted part may be kept a&s;under, from that which is in a &s;ound &s;tate. It would be equally unrea&s;onable to expect, that a &s;poiled ca&s;k of wine could be cured of its tartne&s;s, by drawing or tapping the acid and corrupt|ed portion from the top, and leaving the &s;weet and whole&s;ome part behind. La&s;tly, experience has &s;hewn in numberle&s;s in&s;tances, collected from different ob&s;ervations, that per|&s;ons accu&s;tomed to frequent blood-letting are not only rendered more delicate in their con|&s;titutions, and thereby more &s;ubject to di&s;|ea&s;es, but al&s;o that they die, for the mo&s;t part, at an earlier age than others; and al|though ca&s;es have occurred of &s;ome per&s;ons, who, having been bled twice or four times a year, have neverthele&s;s arrived at a con&s;ider|able age, they can only prove, that vene&s;ec|tion was to them a proper medical remedy, perhaps adapted to their peculiar habit of

body; or that the activity of their vital pow|ers, their mode of life, and other favourable circum&s;tances, internal and external, may have been &s;ufficient to counterbalance the dangerous con&s;equences, re&s;ulting from the frequent lo&s;s of this e&s;&s;ential fluid.</P>

<HEAD>On the Doctrine of Transfu&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>AT a time, when the &s;hortne&s;s of life was imputed to a di&s;tempered &s;tate of the blood; when all di&s;ea&s;es were a&s;cribed to this cau&s;e, without attending to the <HI>whole</HI> of what re|lates to the moral and phy&s;ical nature of man, a conclu&s;ion was ea&s;ily formed, that a radical removal of the corrupted blood, and a com|plete renovation of the entire ma&s;s, by &s;ub|&s;titution, was both practicable and effectual. The &s;peculative mind of man was not at a lo&s;s to devi&s;e expedients, or rather attempts, for effecting this de&s;irable purpo&s;e; and this undoubtedly was one of the bolde&s;t, mo&s;t ex|traordinary, and mo&s;t ingenious attempts ever made to lengthen the period of human life. I allude here to the famous &s;cheme of <HI>transfu&s;ion,</HI> or of <HI>introducing the blood of one an|imal body into that of another;</HI> a curious di&s;cov|ery, attributed to ANDREAS LIBAVIUS, Pro|fe&s;&s;or of Medicine and Chemi&s;try in the Uni|ver&s;ity of Halle, who, in the year 1615, pub|licly recommended experimental e&s;&s;ays to a&s;|certain the fact.

founded by the bomba&s;tic Paracel&s;us, and &s;upported by a numerous tribe of cred|ulous and frantic followers.

An adventurer of the name of CHRISTIAN ROSENKREUZ is &s;aid to have founded this order, in the fourteenth century, after being previou&s;ly initiated into the &s;ublime wi&s;dom of the Ea&s;t, during his travels in Egypt and Fez. According to what we can learn from this work, the intention of the founder, and the final aim of the &s;ociety, appear to have been to accumulate wealth and riches, by means of &s;ecrets known only to the members; and by a proper di&s;tribution of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e trea&s;ures among princes and poten|tates, to promote the grand &s;cheme of the &s;ociety, by producing "<HI>a general revolution of all things.</HI>" In their "Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith" are many bold and &s;ingular dogmas; among others, that the end of the world is at hand; that a general reformation of men and manners will &s;peedily take place; that the wicked &s;hall be expelled or &s;ub|dued, the Jews converted, and the doctrine of Chri&s;t propagated over the whole earth. The Ro&s;encrucians not only believed that the&s;e events mu&s;t happen; but they al&s;o endeavoured to accelerate the &s;ame by their exertions. To their faithful votaries and followers they promi&s;ed abundance of cele&s;tial wi&s;dom, un&s;peakable riches, exemp|tion from di&s;ea&s;e, an immortal &s;tate of ever-blooming youth, and, above all, <HI>the Philo&s;opher's Stone.</HI> Learning and culture of the mind were, by this order, con&s;idered as &s;uperfluous, and de&s;pi&s;ed. They found all knowledge contained in the Bible: this however, has been &s;uppo&s;ed rather a pretext to obviate a charge, which has been brought again&s;t them, of not believing in the Chri&s;tian religion. The truth is, they con&s;ider them&s;elves as &s;uperior to Divine Revelation, and be|lieve every u&s;eful acqui&s;ition, every virtue, to be derived from the influence of the Deity on the &s;oul of man. In this, as well as many other re&s;pects, they appear to be followers of Paracel&s;us, whom they profe&s;s to revere as a me&s;&s;enger of the Divinity. Like him, they pre|tend to cure all di&s;ea&s;es, through <HI>Faith</HI> and the power of imagina|tion;&mdash;to heal the mo&s;t mortal di&s;orders by a touch, or even by &s;im|ply looking at the patient. The Univer&s;al Remedy was likewi&s;e a grand &s;ecret of the order, the di&s;covery of which was promi&s;ed to all its faithful members.</P>
<P>I think it unnece&s;&s;ary to enumerate any more of &s;uch impious fan|cies, if the founder of this &s;till lurking &s;ect, now partly revived, had not a&s;&s;erted with a&s;toni&s;hing effrontery, that human life was capable of prolongation, like a fire kept up by combu&s;tible matter, and that he was in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;ecret, which could verify his a&s;&s;ertion. It is evident, however, from the te&s;timony of the above mentioned Libavius, a man of unque&s;tionable veracity, that this doughty cham|pion in Medical Chemi&s;try, or rather Alchemy, Paracel&s;us, notwith|&s;tanding his vaunting a&s;&s;urances, died at Salzburg in Germany, in the Ho&s;pital of St. Stephen's in 1541; and that his death was prin|cipally brought on by the irregular and di&s;&s;olute mode of life, which he had for a long time pur&s;ued.</P></NOTE></P>

The fir&s;t experiments relative to the tran&s;|fu&s;ion of the blood, appear to have been made, and that with great propriety, on the lower animals. The blood of the young, healthy, and vigorous, was transfu&s;ed into the old and infirm, by means of a delicate tube, placed in a vein opened for that purpo&s;e. The effect of this operation was &s;urpri&s;ing and important: the aged and decrepit animals were &s;oon ob|&s;erved to become more lively, and to move

with greater ea&s;e and rapidity. By the inde|fatigable exertions of LOWER, in England, of DENIS, in France, and of MORITZ HOFFMAN, and others, in Germany, this artificial mode of renovating the life and &s;pirits was &s;ucce&s;s|fully followed up, and even brought to &s;ome degree of perfection. The vein u&s;ually open|ed in the arm of a patient was re&s;orted to for the purpo&s;e of transfu&s;ion; into this a &s;mall tube was placed in a perpendicular direction; the &s;ame vein was then opened in a healthy individual, but more frequently in an animal, into which another tube was forced in a re|clining direction; both the &s;mall tubes were then &s;lided into one another; and in that po|&s;ition the delicate act of transfu&s;ion was &s;afely performed. When the operation was com|pleted, the vein was tied up in the &s;ame man|ner as in blood-letting. Sometimes a quan|tity of blood was di&s;charged from the patient, previous to the experiment taking place. As few per&s;ons however were to be found, who would agree to part with their blood to oth|ers, recour&s;e was generally had to animals, and mo&s;t frequently to the calf, the lamb, and the &s;tag. The&s;e being laid upon a table, and tied &s;o as to be unable to move, the opera|tion was performed in the manner before de|&s;cribed.</P>
<P>In &s;ome in&s;tances, the good effects of the&s;e experiments were evident and promi&s;ing, while they excited the greate&s;t hopes of the future improvement and progre&s;s of this new art. But the increa&s;ing abu&s;es, to which it led bold and inexpert practitioners, together
<PB N="106" REF="039111_0136_10139F6917314180">
with the great number of ca&s;es, wherein it proved un&s;ucce&s;sful, induced the different governments of Europe to put an entire &s;top to the practice, by the &s;tricte&s;t prohibitions. And, indeed, &s;o long as the con&s;titutions of men differ from each other materially as they now do, this is, and ever will be, a hazard|ous, if not a de&s;perate remedy. The blood of every individual is <HI>&s;ui generis,</HI> or of a pecu|liar nature, and &s;uits or accords, as it were, with that body <HI>only,</HI> to which it belongs, and in which it is generated. Hence our hopes of prolonging human life, by artificial evac|uations and injections, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be di&s;|appointed.</P>
<P>We are not however to &s;uppo&s;e, that the&s;e and &s;imilar pur&s;uits, during the times of which we treat as well as tho&s;e which &s;ucceeded, were &s;olely or chiefly followed by mere ad|venturers and fanatics. No; the greate&s;t wits and geniu&s;es of tho&s;e times, together with the mo&s;t learned and eminent men, deemed them objects worthy of their &s;edulous attention. LORD BACON, that &s;agacious explorer of the ar|cana of Nature, that luminary of &s;cience and talents, repre&s;ents life as a flame, which is continually wa&s;ted by the &s;urrounding atmo&s;|phere, and a&s;&s;erts that <HI>all the fluids</HI> of the body may from time to time be renovated, and re|quire &s;uch renovation. The remedies, which he prefers and pre&s;cribes, are conformable to this hypothe&s;is. To prevent the <HI>external</HI> con|&s;umption produced by the circumambient air, he recommends the bath, and, after quitting it, friction with oils and &s;alves, with a view
<PB N="107" REF="039111_0137_10139F274DA149D0">
to fortify the pores, and exclude the influence of the external air. As means to counteract the <HI>internal</HI> wa&s;te of the body, he inculcates the propriety of a cooling, moderate diet, and, above all, extols the narcotic or &s;oporific rem|edies, as the true balm of life, and the be&s;t adapted to attain the de&s;ired effect. Tran|quillity of mind, and a cooling diet, may no doubt be very nece&s;&s;ary in &s;ome ca&s;es, where there is too great an irritability of tempera|ment, and where the circulation of the blood is too rapid. But to a phlegmatic habit, they will rather be injurious than &s;erviceable. Nar|cotic remedies, too, are but ill qualified to cool and to moderate the body, &s;ince they never fail to act as a certain &s;timulus, are at|tended with heat and relaxation, and there|fore mu&s;t accelerate the con&s;umption of the vital powers: that &s;leep, al&s;o, which is artifi|cial, and which they have a tendency to pro|cure, cannot upon the whole be &s;alutary. It is no le&s;s evident, that the vital power &s;up|plied by heat or <HI>caloric</HI> (which is principally evolved from the air,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We &s;hall have occa&s;ion to in&s;titute a particular inquiry into the properties of <HI>air,</HI> in the next Chapter, from which it will appear, that one &s;pecies of air is more noxious to the vital power than an|other, and that there is a greater con&s;umption of it in one, than in the other.</NOTE> and introduced into the body by means of re&s;piration) mu&s;t be much le&s;s con&s;iderable during &s;leep, than while we are awake.</P>
<P>For improving the fluids of the aged, and renovating the dry and corrupted part of them, Lord Bacon thinks nothing can be put in competition with powerful laxatives, and
<PB N="108" REF="039111_0138_10139F6BB3C73020">
advi&s;es the u&s;e of a full cour&s;e of them, every two or three years at lea&s;t. The&s;e remedies are, in his opinion, the be&s;t qualified to evac|uate vitiated humours, and afterwards to pro|duce, in lieu of them, milder and more heal|thy juices. The exhau&s;ted, and, as it were, thir&s;ty ve&s;&s;els may be repleni&s;hed and &s;trength|ened, according to his ideas, by a refre&s;hing and nouri&s;hing diet.</P>
<P>However plau&s;ible this theory may appear, the execution of it is impracticable, and the ba&s;is on which it re&s;ts, merely conjectural. If it were po&s;&s;ible to withdraw the corrupted part of the fluids from the body, by means of evacuants, and at the &s;ame time to remove the <HI>cau&s;es,</HI> which produce this tendency to corruption, then the doctrine laid down by Lord Bacon would de&s;erve every prai&s;e, and the mo&s;t minute attention to its merits. But it ought to be ob&s;erved, that the activity and energy of <HI>the whole</HI> organized &s;y&s;tem is indi&s;|pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary in the proce&s;s of &s;eparating the noxious or u&s;ele&s;s particles. As, there|fore, laxatives remove only the more watery fluids; as they have a bad effect on the &s;tom|ach and inte&s;tines, by rendering them too ir|ritable, and con&s;equently le&s;s tonic or vigor|ous; as the bile, a fluid &s;o e&s;&s;ential to the concoction of food and a&s;&s;imilation of ali|mentary matter, is thereby u&s;ele&s;sly wa&s;ted; as the balance between the &s;olid and fluid parts of the body is in this manner de&s;troy|ed; and as, upon the whole, the vital powers mu&s;t &s;u&s;tain a con&s;iderable degree of diminu|tion in affording &s;upplies, to repair what is
<PB N="109" REF="039111_0139_10139F2AF767A7A0">
lo&s;t;&mdash;the precarious nature of <HI>evacuants,</HI> as the means of prolonging human life, appears too evident to require further illu&s;tration.</P>
<P>It is not, therefore, in &s;uch remedies as the&s;e, which can only be employed with &s;afe|ty, where a judicious attention is paid to the ca&s;e and circum&s;tances of the patient, that we ought to confide, as the mo&s;t proper to pro|long the period of our exi&s;tence: we mu&s;t &s;earch for means le&s;s dangerous and more ef|fectual.</P>
<P>There is a pretty numerous cla&s;s of men, who profe&s;s to calculate the length of their lives, not &s;o much by the number of years or days they have lived, as by the u&s;e they have made of them, or, to &s;peak more plainly, by the quantum of &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure they have en|joyed.

<P>One of the mo&s;t dazzling and &s;ucce&s;sful In|ventors in modern times was MESSMER, who began his career of Medical Knight-errantry at Vienna. His hou&s;e was the mirror of high life; the rendezvous of the gay, the young, the opulent, enlivened and entertained with continual concerts, routs, and illuminations. At a great expen&s;e he imported into Germa|ny the fir&s;t <HI>Harmonica</HI> from this country; he e&s;tabli&s;hed cabinets of natural curio&s;ities, and laboured con&s;tantly and &s;ecretly in his chem|ical laboratory; &s;o that he acquired the repu|tation of being a great Alchemi&s;t, a philo&s;o|pher &s;tudiou&s;ly employed in the mo&s;t u&s;eful and important re&s;earches.</P>
<P>In 1766 he fir&s;t publicly announced the ob|ject and nature of his &s;ecret labours:&mdash;all his di&s;coveries centered in the <HI>magnet</HI>&mdash;which, according to his hypothe&s;is, was the greate&s;t and &s;afe&s;t remedy hitherto propo&s;ed again&s;t all di&s;ea&s;es incident to the human body. This declaration of Me&s;&s;mer excited very general attention; the more &s;o, as about the &s;ame time he e&s;tabli&s;hed an ho&s;pital in his own hou&s;e, into which he admitted a number of patients <HI>gratis.</HI> Such di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s pro|cured, as might be expected, no &s;mall addition to his &s;ame. He was, be&s;ides, fortunate in gaining over many celebrated phy&s;icians to e&s;pou&s;e his opinions, who lavi&s;hed the greate&s;t encomiums on his new art, and were in&s;tru|mental in communicating to the public a
<PB N="114" REF="039111_0144_10139F7515B918A0">
number of &s;ucce&s;sful experiments. This &s;eems to have &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the expectations of Me&s;&s;mer, and induced him to extend his original plan farther than it is likely he fir&s;t intended. We find him &s;oon afterwards a&s;&s;uming a more dogmatical and my&s;terious air, when, for the purpo&s;e of &s;hining exclu&s;ively, he appeared in the character of a <HI>Magician</HI>&mdash;his pride and egoti&s;m would brook neither equal nor com|petitor.</P>
<P>The common Load&s;tone, or Mineral Mag|net, which is &s;o well known, did not appear to him &s;ufficiently important and my&s;terious: he contrived an unu&s;ual and unknown one, to the effect of which he gave the name of '<HI>Animal Magneti&s;m.</HI>' After this he proceeded to a &s;till bolder a&s;&s;umption, every where giv|ing it out, that the inconceivable powers of this &s;ubtle fluid were centered in his own per&s;on. Now the Mono-drama began; and Me&s;&s;mer, at once the hero and chorus of the piece, performed his part in a ma&s;terly man|ner. He placed the mo&s;t nervous, hy&s;teric, and hypochondriac patients oppo&s;ite to him; and by the &s;ole act of &s;tretching forth his fin|ger, made them feel the mo&s;t violent &s;hocks. The effects of this wonderful power excited univer&s;al a&s;toni&s;hment; its activity and pen|etrability being confirmed by unque&s;tionable te&s;timonies, from which it appeared, that blows, re&s;embling tho&s;e given by a blunt iron, could be imparted by the operator, while he him&s;elf was &s;eparated by two doors, nay even by thick walls. The very looks of this Prince of Jugglers had the power to excite painful cramps and twitches.</P>

This wonderful tide of &s;ucce&s;s ea&s;ily in&s;ti|gated his indefatigable genius to bolder at|tempts, e&s;pecially as he had no &s;evere criti|ci&s;ms to apprehend from the &s;uper&s;titious multitude. He roundly a&s;&s;erted things, of which he never offered the lea&s;t &s;hadow of proof; and for the truth of which he had no other pledge to offer, but his own high repu|tation. At one time he could communicate his magnetic power to paper, wool, &s;ilk, bread, leather, &s;tones, water, &amp;c.&mdash;at another he pro|nounced, that certain individuals po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a greater degree of &s;u&s;ceptibility for this power than others.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be owned, however, to the honour of his cotemporaries, that many of them made it their bu&s;ine&s;s to encounter his ex|travagant preten&s;ions, and to refute his dog|matical a&s;&s;ertions with the mo&s;t convincing arguments. Yet he long enjoyed the triumph of being &s;upported by blind followers; and their too great number completely overpow|ered the &s;uffrages of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>Me&s;&s;mer perceived at length, that he &s;hould never be able to reach, in his native country, the point which he had fixed upon, as the term of his magnetical career. The Germans began to di&s;credit his pompous claims; but it was only after repeated failures in &s;ome im|portant promi&s;ed cures, that he found him|&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;eeking protection in Paris. There he met with a mo&s;t flattering reception, being care&s;&s;ed, and in a manner adored, by a nation which has ever been ex|travagantly fond of every thing new, whim|&s;ical,

and my&s;terious. Me&s;&s;mer well knew how to turn this national propen&s;ity to his own advantage. He addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf partic|ularly to the weak; to &s;uch as wi&s;hed to be con&s;idered men of profound knowledge, but who, when they are compelled to be &s;ilent from real ignorance, take refuge under the impenetrable &s;hield of my&s;tery.

We need not wonder, therefore, if he availed him|&s;elf of their moral and phy&s;ical character, to in&s;ure ea&s;y entrance to his doctrines, and &s;uc|ce&s;s to his pretended experiments: in fact, he found friends and admirers, wherever he made his appearance.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His fir&s;t adverti&s;ement was couched in the following high-&s;ound|ing t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rms: "Behold a di&s;covery which promi&s;es un&s;peakable advan|tages to the human race, and immortal &s;ame to its author!

What &s;plendid promi&s;es! what rich pro&s;|pects! Me&s;&s;mer, the greate&s;t of philo&s;ophers, the mo&s;t virtuous of men, the phy&s;ician and &s;aviour of mankind, charitably opens his arms to all his fellow-mortals, who &s;tand in need of comfort and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. No wonder that the cau&s;e of Magneti&s;m, under &s;uch a zealous apo&s;tle, rapidly gained ground, and obtained every day large additions to the number of its converts. To the gay, the nervous, and the di&s;&s;ipated of all ranks and ages, it held out the mo&s;t flattering promi&s;es. Men of the fir&s;t re&s;pectability intere&s;ted them|&s;elves in behalf of this new philo&s;ophy; they anticipated, in idea, the more happy and more vigorous race to proceed, as it were by enchantment, from the wonderful impul&s;ive powers of Animal Magneti&s;m. Nay, even the French Government was &s;o far &s;educed by the&s;e flattering appearances, as to offer the German Adventurer <HI>thirty thou&s;and livres</HI> for the communication of his &s;ecret art. He ap|pears, however, to have under&s;tood his own intere&s;t better than thus to di&s;po&s;e of his hy|pothetical property, which upon a more ac|curate inve&s;tigation might be excepted again&s;t, as con&s;i&s;ting of unfair articles of purcha&s;e. He con&s;equently returned the following an|&s;wer to the credulous French Mini&s;ters:&mdash;

"That Dr. M. con&s;idered his art of too great importance, and the abu&s;es it might lead to, too dangerous for him at pre&s;ent to make it public; that he mu&s;t therefore re&s;erve to him&s;elf the time of its publication, and mode of introducing it to general u&s;e and ob&s;erva|tion; that he would fir&s;t take proper mea|&s;ures to initiate or prepare the minds of men, by exciting in them a &s;u&s;ceptibility of this great power; and that he would then under|take to communicate his &s;ecret gradually, which he meant to do without hope of re|ward."</P>
<P>Me&s;&s;mer, too politic to part with his &s;ecret for &s;o &s;mall a premium, had a better pro&s;pect in view; and his apparent di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s and he&s;itation &s;erved only to &s;ound an over|curious public; to allure more victims to his delu&s;ive practices; and to retain them more firmly in their implicit belief. Soon after this, we find Me&s;&s;mer ea&s;ily prevailed upon to in&s;titute a private &s;ociety, into which none were admitted, but &s;uch as bound them&s;elves by a vow to perpetual &s;ecrecy. The&s;e pupils he agreed to in&s;truct in his important my&s;te|ries, on condition of each paying him a fee of <HI>one hundred louis.</HI> In the cour&s;e of &s;ix months, having had not fewer than three hundred &s;uch pupils, he realized a fortune of <HI>thirty thou&s;and louis.</HI> It appears, however, that his di&s;ciples did not long adhere to their engage|ment: we find them &s;eparating gradually from their profe&s;&s;or, and e&s;tabli&s;hing &s;chools for the propagation of his &s;y&s;tem, with a view, no doubt, to reimbur&s;e them&s;elves for their

expen&s;es in the acqui&s;ition of the magneti&s;ing art. But few of them having clearly under|&s;tood the enigmatic terms and my&s;terious doctrines of their foreign ma&s;ter, every new adept exerted him&s;elf to excel his fellow-la|bourers, in additional explanations and inven|tions: others, who did not po&s;&s;e&s;s, or could not &s;pare the &s;um of one hundred louis, were indu&s;triou&s;ly employed in attempts to di&s;cov|er the &s;ecret by their own ingenuity; and thus aro&s;e a great variety of magnetical &s;ects. At length, however, Me&s;&s;mer's authority be|came &s;u&s;pected; his pecuniary acqui&s;itions were now notorious, and our <HI>humane</HI> and <HI>di&s;|intere&s;ted philo&s;opher</HI> was a&s;&s;ailed with critical and &s;atirical animadver&s;ions from every quar|ter. The futility of his proce&s;s for medical purpo&s;es, as well as the bad con&s;equences it might produce in a moral point of view, &s;oon became topics of common conver&s;ation, and at length excited even the apprehen&s;ions of Government. One dangerous effect of the magnetic a&s;&s;ociations was, that young volup|tuaries began to employ this art, to promote their libidinous and de&s;tructive de&s;igns.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as matters had taken this &s;erious turn, the French Government, much to its credit, deputed four re&s;pectable and unpreju|diced men, to whom were afterwards added four others of great learning and abilities, to inquire into, and appreciate the merits of the new di&s;covery of animal magneti&s;m. The&s;e phi|lo&s;ophers, among whom we find the illu&s;trious names of Franklin and Lavoi&s;ier, recognized indeed very &s;urpri&s;ing and unexpected phe|nomena

in the phy&s;ical &s;tate of magneti&s;ed in|dividuals; but they gave it as their opinion, that the power of imagination, and not ani|mal magneti&s;m, had produced the&s;e effects. Sen&s;ible of the &s;uperior influence, which the imagination can exert on the human body, when it is effectually wrought upon, they perceived, after a number of experiments and facts frequently repeated, that <HI>Contact</HI> or Touch, <HI>Imagination, Imitation,</HI> and <HI>excited Sen&s;i|bility,</HI> were the real and <HI>&s;ole</HI> cau&s;es of tho&s;e phenomena, which had &s;o much confounded the illiterate, the credulous, and the enthu&s;i|a&s;tic; that this boa&s;ted magnetic element had no real exi&s;tence in nature; con&s;equently that Me&s;&s;mer him&s;elf was either an arrant Impo&s;|tor, or a deceived Fanatic.</P>
<P>In the mean time, this magneti&s;ing bu&s;ine&s;s had made no &s;mall progre&s;s in Germany; a number of periodical and other publications vindicated its claims to public favour and at|tention; and &s;ome literary men, who had rendered them&s;elves ju&s;tly celebrated by their former writings, now appeared as bold and eager champions in &s;upport of this my&s;tical medley.

It is further worthy of notice, that an eminent phy&s;ician of that place, in a recent publication, does not &s;cruple to rank magnet|i&s;m among medical remedies! Yet it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the great body of the learned, throughout Germany, have endeavoured, by &s;trong and impartial critici&s;m, to oppo&s;e and refute Animal Magneti&s;m, con&s;idered as a medical &s;y&s;tem. And how &s;hould it be other|wi&s;e, &s;ince it is highly ridiculous to imagine, that violent agitations, &s;pa&s;ms, convul&s;ions, &amp;c. which are obviou&s;ly &s;ymptoms of a di&s;|ea&s;ed &s;tate, and which mu&s;t increa&s;e rather than dimini&s;h the di&s;po&s;ition for nervous di&s;|ea&s;es, can be the means of improving the con|&s;titution, and ultimately prolonging human life? Every attentive per&s;on mu&s;t have ob|&s;erved, that too frequent intercour&s;e between nervous and hypochondriac patients is infec|tious; and, if this be the ca&s;e, public a&s;&s;em|blies for exhibiting per&s;ons magneti&s;ed can neither be &s;afe nor proper.

his pride was mortified by a &s;evere check.

<HEAD>Ab&s;urdity of Specific Remedies.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the doctrines now laid before the reader, I hope I &s;hall not be thought unrea|&s;onable, in drawing this conclu&s;ion:&mdash;That the plans for prolonging human life are gen|erally erroneous and injudicious; that all <HI>ar|tificial</HI> means have rather a tendency to &s;hort|en than to prolong it; and that we can nev|er &s;afely expect the accompli&s;hment of this great object, unle&s;s we pur&s;ue methods more con&s;onant to nature, more verified by ex|perience.</P>
<P>The truth of this inference will be more evident, when we come to inquire into the <HI>conditions,</HI> which are e&s;&s;entially requi&s;ite to the attainment of a long life.</P>
<P>The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of the&s;e is a certain bodily and mental di&s;po&s;ition to longevity, not ea&s;ily de|fined, yet &s;ufficiently known and under&s;tood. In whatever this di&s;po&s;ition may con&s;i&s;t, it is a matter of a&s;toni&s;hment, and inexplicable by the laws of animal economy, that many indi|viduals, frequently under the mo&s;t unfavoura|ble circum&s;tances, and in the mo&s;t unwhole|&s;ome climates, have attained to a great and hap|py age. It may indeed be confidently affirmed, that, without this principal requi&s;ite, all other
<PB N="126" REF="039111_0156_10139F82B1A14E98">
advantages are often of no avail; the mo&s;t &s;alubrious country air, a di&s;trict abounding with aged inhabitants, a rigid adherence to the diet of Cornaro, a regular cour&s;e of exer|ci&s;e and recreations, with the be&s;t art of the phy&s;ician, are not alone &s;ufficient to in&s;ure the felicitous pro&s;pect of a long and healthy life.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If the&s;e rational means be unavailing to in&s;ure longevity, &s;till more &s;o are tho&s;e miraculous remedies introduced by &s;uper&s;tition. The ancients conceived the idea of a <HI>principle of life,</HI> which they com|pared to a radical fluid;&mdash;the Alchemi&s;ts expected to find this <HI>orig|inal entity</HI> in <HI>gold,</HI> by the u&s;e of which they pretended that the hu|man body might acquire the &s;olidity and durability of that metal. Others traced the germ of life in bodies of con&s;iderable duration; in plants and animals; in the wood of the Cedar, and in the fle&s;h of the Stag. BOERHAAVE has made a facetious remark upon the &s;ubject: "This notion," &s;ays he, "is ju&s;t as ridiculous as that of the man, who, in order to prepare him&s;elf for the bu&s;ine&s;s of a running footman, is &s;aid to have lived for &s;ome time entirely on the fle&s;h of hares; hoping thus to &s;urpa&s;s all his fellows in agility."</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Secondly:</HI> It is certain that there is, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, a &s;ort of hereditary di&s;po&s;ition to lon|gevity; an innate principle or quality, which, like many family di&s;ea&s;es, is propagated from one generation to another. Perhaps nine out of ten old per&s;ons could make it appear, that their parents and ance&s;tors al&s;o lived to a great age; a rea&s;on which may be admitted without having recour&s;e to any material &s;ub|&s;tance, as the cau&s;e or effect of this inherent virtue.</P>
<P>The <HI>third</HI> requi&s;ite to longevity is a <HI>perfect birth</HI> of the child, and a proper &s;ub&s;equent conduct in the mother; upon which &s;ubject it is not my intention to expatiate in this place. That acute phy&s;iologi&s;t, Lord Bacon, &s;omewhere remarks, "that children partake more of the nature of the mother, the longer
<PB N="127" REF="039111_0157_10139FC176ACCBB0">
time &s;he has nur&s;ed them; and that tho&s;e children which mo&s;t re&s;emble the mother, will be generally found to have a claim to longevity."</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly:</HI> A gradual, and not too precipi|tate culture of the phy&s;ical and mental facul|ties may be properly con&s;idered as an excel|lent preliminary &s;tep towards prolonging life. The age of man bears a certain proportion to the growth of his various powers; and the longer we can protract the different &s;tages of life, the more extended will be the whole compa&s;s of our exi&s;tence. As it is evidently the de&s;ign of nature, that man &s;hould live longer than mo&s;t of the lower animals, he of cour&s;e requires a greater &s;pace of time, to de|velope the faculties both of mind and body. Animals, which arrive &s;oon at the perfection of their nature and form, live but a &s;hort time. Man requires upwards of twenty, and accord|ing to &s;ome, twenty-five years, before he at|tains to full maturity; and if it be a rule of nature, that animals in general live eight times the number of years, which is requi&s;ite to the attainment of their perfect growth, a &s;trong pre&s;umption ari&s;es, that the age of man might be extended to nearly two hundred years. In the works of the illu&s;trious Bacon, and parti|cularly in his "Hi&s;torical View of Life and Death," are given many &s;trong arguments to confirm this a&s;&s;ertion. Surpri&s;ing as it may appear to &s;ome, there is a po&s;&s;ibility at lea&s;t, if not a probability, that the term of human life might be &s;till further extended, if man|kind could by any means be per&s;uaded to re|turn
<PB N="128" REF="039111_0158_10139F876D3F2CF8">
to that primeval &s;tate of nature, from which hi&s;tory and tradition have furni&s;hed us with &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hing and almo&s;t incredible in&s;tances of longevity. It is not my inten|tion here to inquire into the degree of credit, which may be due to the accounts of &s;ome ex|traordinary facts of individual longevity, re|corded by the &s;acred hi&s;torian; as the learn|ed vary much in their opinion, relative to the mode of computation, and whether the Solar, the Arabic, or the Lunar year, or a &s;till &s;hort|er mea&s;ure of time, is alluded to. This, at lea&s;t, &s;eems to be generally admitted, that the antediluvians enjoyed an enviable, uninter|rupted &s;tate of health; that their vegetable aliment, and general mode of living, were ex|tremely &s;imple and no wi&s;e prejudicial; that the con&s;titution and temperature of the globe it&s;elf mu&s;t have been greatly affected and de|teriorated, in con&s;equence of the Flood, or other cau&s;es of which we are ignorant; and, la&s;tly, that tho&s;e impetuous and inordinate appetites and pa&s;&s;ions, which, like flames, may now be &s;aid to con&s;ume the powers of life, were then either le&s;s violent, or exerted their baneful influence at a much later period of life.</P>
<P>Nature re&s;ents every outrage committed on her trea&s;ures, and &s;eldom fails to puni&s;h the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors with lingering di&s;ea&s;e, or early di&s;&s;olution. This ob&s;ervation may be applied to the moral as well as the phy&s;ical faculties of man. It is commonly &s;aid, and not with|out &s;ome degree of truth, that very forward

children &s;eldom live to any age; and that too early an exertion of mental powers is in mo&s;t ca&s;es de&s;tructive. The &s;ame remark holds good in what relates to the body. The inhabitants of hot climates, who frequently marry at the age of ten and twelve, or twelve and fourteen, begin to be old at thirty, and rarely &s;urvive the &s;ixtieth year. Every thing which ha&s;tens the evolution of the natural powers, every exertion of &s;trength, di&s;propor|tionate to the ability of the individual, &s;hould be carefully avoided, as of a dangerous ten|dency. Hence the great art of education, the great art of living, con&s;i&s;ts in following the path of nature.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly;</HI> We &s;hould con&s;tantly inure our|&s;elves to the habits of &s;upporting and re&s;i&s;ting the various impre&s;&s;ions of external agency.&mdash;Some per&s;ons who have paid a very rigid at|tention to diet, have notwith&s;tanding been unable to reach even a middling age; while others, who have been addicted to the mo&s;t irregular and extravagant cour&s;es, have been ob&s;erved to live to one very advanced. Hence ari&s;e contradictory maxims in dietetics, which can only be reconciled by deciding chemically between the two extremes, and a&s;certaining pretty nearly the ab&s;olute and relative &s;alu|brity of things. All deviations from the rules of diet are in a certain degree hurtful; al|though the&s;e may, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, have only a limited value. Many epicures have been known to reach their &s;eventieth and eightieth year, if they have once &s;urvived a certain

critical period of their lives.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Experience &s;hows, that there is a particular term of life which, if we can pa&s;s in the fullne&s;s of health and vigour, leaves the greate&s;t probability of living to a con&s;iderable age. In the female &s;ex, this period generally arrives at, or before, the fiftieth year; in the male, it is about the &s;ixtieth year. GELLIUS, a medical author of credit, a&s;&s;erts, from ob&s;ervations founded on long experience, that the &s;ixty|third year is, to mo&s;t con&s;titutions, a critical and dangerous one.&mdash;The Egyptians called this epocha <HI>Androclos,</HI> becau&s;e man begins from that time to experience a rapid decay of &s;trength and energy. Others, rather more &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly, maintained that, about this period, many individuals die, or at lea&s;t are &s;ubject to &s;evere attacks of di&s;ea&s;e.&mdash;The Emperor AUGUSTUS received the congratulations of his friends, on having &s;urvived this trying period.</NOTE> As &s;oon as the body becomes accu&s;tomed to the u&s;e of certain things, at fir&s;t di&s;agreeable and perhaps hurt|ful, the noxious tendency will not only be re|moved, but we &s;hall find our frame hardened and &s;trengthened by the habit of u&s;ing them. Nature mu&s;t &s;tand many a &s;hock, if &s;he would familiarize her&s;elf to the vici&s;&s;itudes of climate and oppo&s;ite modes of life, but every victory &s;he gains in the&s;e encounters, will be a means of rendering her more vigorous and uncon|querable. How could the &s;ublime mind of FREDERIC THE GREAT have remained &s;o long in its earthly vehicle, if he had not improved, by con&s;tant culture and di&s;cipline, his original di&s;po&s;ition to a long life? A thou&s;and other men, who have endured as much exerci&s;e of body and exertion of mind in their younger years, have yet not attained to any remarka|ble age.&mdash;Severe and ob&s;tinate di&s;ea&s;es have al&s;o been thought, in many in&s;tances, to con|tribute to the prolongation of life: this is at be&s;t, however, but a doubtful point; although it cannot be denied, that many &s;ick per&s;ons have, to all appearance, acquired additional

&s;trength and &s;pirits, after having recovered from a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing quartan ague, or &s;ome threatening pulmonary di&s;order.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly:</HI> We may take notice of a certain <HI>&s;teady and equal progre&s;s through life,</HI> as highly conducive to the great object in view, wheth|er it flows in the manner of a gentle &s;tream, or re&s;embles the more active cour&s;e of a rap|id river. The mind, when accu&s;tomed to certain &s;ituations and pur&s;uits, which almo&s;t con&s;tantly affect it in an uniform manner, is mo&s;t likely to pre&s;erve its rea&s;oning powers unimpaired and &s;trong. He whom neither violent joy convul&s;es, nor deep melancholy corrodes, who&s;e drama of life is not chequer|ed by too &s;udden vici&s;&s;itudes, may, with &s;ome probability, expect a long enjoyment of that life, to which he has become &s;o habituated. There are many who&s;e days quietly glide away, like tho&s;e of a &s;imple ru&s;tic, in contin|ual &s;amene&s;s: &s;uch per&s;ons, it is ob&s;erved, generally live to a great age.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly:</HI> A very nece&s;&s;ary cau&s;e of the at|tainment of an advanced age, is a &s;ound &s;tate of dige&s;tion. In very old per&s;ons, we gen|erally find the dige&s;tive organs in excellent condition; nor is there a &s;urer &s;ymptom of approaching di&s;&s;olution, than complaints in the &s;tomach, or frequent returns of indige&s;|tion. The Swi&s;s are indebted, it is thought, to the vigorous tone of their dige&s;tive pow|ers, for the long pre&s;ervation of their lives, in general, and for the great number of aged per&s;ons among them. Milk and vegetable food &s;eem remarkably well adapted to invig|orate
<PB N="132" REF="039111_0162_10139F8B8D7F8160">
the &s;tomach. To effect the &s;ame pur|po&s;e, Lord Bacon advi&s;es old people to have recour&s;e to &s;trengthening baths, fomentations, and &s;imilar <HI>external</HI> remedies, which operate upon the ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tem. At the &s;ame time, a thin but nouri&s;hing and moderate di|et &s;hould be ob&s;erved, in order to &s;pare the organs of dige&s;tion.</P>
<P><HI>Eighthly,</HI> and la&s;tly: We may recommend equanimity, or that &s;tate of the mind, when, from the happy nature of its pur&s;uits, it is not di&s;quieted by too violent exertions. In the literary profe&s;&s;ions, and particularly among &s;uch individuals as are placed in ea&s;y circum|&s;tances, we di&s;cover as many in&s;tances of lon|gevity, as in the more laborious occupations. It was remarked by the Ancients, that gram|marians and rhetoricians commonly attained a great age. The mind being engaged in &s;ci|entific pur&s;uits, and other objects in which it finds plea&s;ure, &s;uch as conver&s;ation on literary and mixed topics, collecting the productions of nature, a continual &s;eries of mental re&s;earch, diver&s;ifying the pur&s;uits or amu&s;ements, yet gradually and con&s;tantly per&s;evering in exer|tions towards the attainment of &s;ome princi|pal object&mdash;all &s;upply the vital power, as it were, with materials, like the cru&s;e of oil, which proved a never-failing &s;upport to the widow of <HI>Sarepta.</HI> On the other hand, it is a general remark, that deep thinkers, &s;pecu|lative philo&s;ophers, and tho&s;e who&s;e powers are continually ab&s;orbed in ab&s;tru&s;e inquiry, &s;oon feel the effects of age, from the great ex|ertions of their mental powers. This mu&s;t
<PB N="133" REF="039111_0163_10139FCA40438910">
be under&s;tood, however, with exceptions, as in the ca&s;es of SIR ISAAC NEWTON, HALLER, EULER, and the pride of his nation and age, the profound and venerable KANT, &s;till living at Koenig&s;berg.</P>
<P>I venture to &s;ay thus much on the various rules and precautions requi&s;ite to attain a long and healthful life. Some of the particulars are, no doubt, found united in a certain pro|portion of the individuals, who arrive at a re|&s;pectable age. It is commonly remarked al|&s;o, that the inhabitants of mountainous coun|tries, for the mo&s;t part live to a greater age than tho&s;e of plain and, particularly, mar&s;hy di&s;tricts. This is in part true; yet we are not to con&s;ider the lofty regions in the Alps and Pyrenees as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the&s;e &s;alubrious qualities; for it is only upon moderate heights, and in hilly rather than mountainous coun|tries, that we &s;o frequently meet with people of an unu&s;ual age. Per&s;ons who are con|&s;tantly travelling, are likewi&s;e &s;aid to enjoy a long and healthful life; and Lord Bacon fur|ther includes, in the li&s;t of long livers, &s;uch as are of a melancholy temperament. It is a que&s;tionable point, whether the great age of many Turks is to be a&s;cribed to the &s;erenity of their climate, their daily u&s;e of the bath, or their uncommon temperance in eating and drinking. For, as to their copious u&s;e of opium, which is con&s;idered by them almo&s;t as nece&s;&s;ary as food, we have already &s;hown the noxious tendency of &s;uch practice; opium generating, in a remarkable degree, a di&s;po&s;i|tion of the fluids, in many re&s;pects re&s;embling
<PB N="134" REF="039111_0164_10136E2A7369BA58">
that of hypochondria&s;is. There is &s;carcely an in&s;tance of any per&s;on, that has attained to uncommon longevity, who has not been par|ticular in his diet and manner of living. But in this re&s;pect we cannot hope to derive ad|vantage from exce&s;&s;ive &s;olicitude:&mdash;for, as when in want of &s;leep, the more we think of it, the more it &s;huns us; &s;o tho&s;e who are mo&s;t anxious for longevity, are the lea&s;t likely to attain it. Age is a gift, which Heaven frequently be&s;tows upon mortals, when they are a&s;leep, or in other words, when they are &s;carcely &s;en&s;ible of it!</P>

<HEAD>On the Symptoms of actual Di&s;&s;olution.</HEAD>
<P>THAT many unfortunate individuals are con&s;igned to the grave, before they are actu|ally dead, is a truth too well atte&s;ted to re|quire demon&s;tration. If this were not, or never had been the ca&s;e, it could not have ex|cited that degree of attention on the Conti|nent, and particularly in Germany, which of late years has been be&s;towed on this impor|tant &s;ubject. The mo&s;t re&s;pectable Phy&s;icians have proved by incontrovertible facts, that &s;ick per&s;ons have often been ha&s;tily buried, or to &s;peak more properly, &s;mothered in their coffins, either from accidental mi&s;take, or from the mo&s;t dete&s;table motives. But, as many fal&s;e and &s;candalous reports are generally cir|culated, in addition to tho&s;e founded on truth, we need not wonder, that this bu&s;ine&s;s has
<PB N="135" REF="039111_0165_10139FCCC7809010">
not been conducted, hitherto, with that de|gree of calm and patient attention, to which it is ju&s;tly entitled. Hou&s;es for the reception of per&s;ons apparently dead have been, at length, erected in various parts of Germany, in Berlin, Jena, Coburg, &amp;c. This idea, at the fir&s;t view of it, may to &s;ome appear whim|&s;ical; but tho&s;e who know the extent of the power of vitality, and the almo&s;t infinite modifications of which that power is &s;u&s;cepti|ble, will not ridicule a propo&s;al, which origi|nated in motives of prudence and humanity. Into the&s;e hou&s;es every inhabitant of the town, or di&s;trict, has a right to &s;end the body of a decea&s;ed per&s;on, on paying a trifling &s;um per night, towards the expen&s;es of the in&s;ti|tution. Here the body i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> depo&s;ited on a couch, lightly covered, and provided with a &s;tring fa&s;tened to the hand, which pulls a bell on the top of the hou&s;e. A watchman is ap|pointed to receive and regi&s;ter the bodies brought into the hou&s;e, and to give the alarm, if nece&s;&s;ary. This, to &s;ay the lea&s;t of it, is no &s;mall convenience to families in a large city, crowded into narrow apartments, with a number of children, who mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;uf|fer from the pe&s;tiferous exhalations of dead bodies. But this is not the principal advan|tage attending &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hments: it is un|que&s;tionably a great &s;atisfaction to the rela|tives of the decea&s;ed, to be a&s;&s;ured that every means have been u&s;ed to pre&s;erve from the mo&s;t dreadful of all deaths, a friend who&s;e memory they revere.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="039111_0166_10139F8E1CFFA138">
The ca&s;es, in which death can be clearly a&s;|certained, are nearly the following:</P>
<P N="1">1. When putrefaction has actually taken place over the whole animal frame; as in|&s;tances are common, in which a partial mor|tification of an arm or a leg is by no means mortal.</P>
<P N="2">2. In the nervous apoplexy of the aged; as &s;uch per&s;ons generally die in con&s;equence of &s;lowly wa&s;ting di&s;orders, various &s;pecies of pal&s;y, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3. If the patient expires after a long &s;tand|ing con&s;umption, hectic fever, or ulcerations of the brea&s;t and lungs, di&s;ea&s;es now very common.</P>
<P N="4">4. If any of the larger blood-ve&s;&s;els, or other parts e&s;&s;ential to life, have received ex|ternal injury, by violent blows, brui&s;es, or cuts, attended with great lo&s;s of blood, which could not be &s;topped by artificial means. If we are unable to &s;upply the lo&s;s of this vital fluid, and to re&s;tore the organization of the parts thus de&s;troyed; particularly if the brain, the lungs, the heart, the &s;tomach, or any of the inte&s;tines, have &s;uffered from a &s;evere wound, a &s;peedy di&s;&s;olution may be con&s;idered as inevitable.</P>
<P N="5">5. After chronic di&s;orders of the inte&s;|tines, ob&s;tructions of the abdominal ve&s;&s;els, and drop&s;y thence ari&s;ing&mdash;or if an incurable weakne&s;s in the brea&s;t has occa&s;ioned the or|ganic de&s;truction, or o&s;&s;ification of the pecto|ral ve&s;&s;els, there is little pro&s;pect of the re|covery of &s;uch a per&s;on; as the&s;e complaints of a&s;thmatic &s;ufferers, in general, are not in a

ju&s;t proportion to the whole &s;tate of the body; for in&s;tance, if their appetite and dige&s;tion have been unimpaired previous to their di&s;|ea&s;e, or if their mu&s;cular &s;trength has not &s;uf|fered from the like affections.</P>
<P N="6">6. In per&s;ons of tender and debilitated nerves, who have been long &s;ubject to &s;pa&s;ms or epileptic fits, particularly if they die in child-bed, in con&s;equence of violent hemorr|hages, or after repeated and oppre&s;&s;ive agita|tions of mind;&mdash;in &s;uch ca&s;es there is no hope left, as it is too late to think of changing or improving the con&s;titution of the nervous &s;y&s;tem. La&s;tly,</P>
<P N="7">7. If a per&s;on gradually wa&s;tes away in a malignant nervous or putrid fever, or after long fa&s;ting from want of food. In the&s;e in|&s;tances it is not in the power of the medical art to re&s;tore the &s;hrivelled ve&s;&s;els to their proper ten&s;ion and energy; con&s;equently all our ef|forts to reanimate the body will be unavail|ing.</P>
<P>There remains now to be &s;tated al&s;o, in what ca&s;es and &s;ituations the &s;ymptoms of apparent death are le&s;s certain, &s;o that &s;ome hope of recovery is &s;till left to the di&s;con&s;o|late friend and relative. The&s;e are principally the following: after faintings, &s;udden lo&s;s of blood from di&s;ea&s;ed inte&s;tines,&mdash;in certain ca&s;es of repelled morbid matter, for in&s;tance, in the &s;mall-pox, mea&s;les, poi&s;ons, and the like, which frequently produce a &s;purious kind of apoplexy;&mdash;after hy&s;teric and hypo|chondriac &s;pa&s;ms and colics of a tran&s;itory kind, which have not too often recurred; af|ter
<PB N="138" REF="039111_0168_10139F90CC5355A0">
mental anxiety, perturbation, terror, and other oppre&s;&s;ive pa&s;&s;ions, where every thing depends on a &s;peedy removal of the cau&s;es. To this li&s;t we may likewi&s;e add the ca&s;es of drowned, hanged, and otherwi&s;e &s;uffocated per&s;ons, or tho&s;e who appear to be dead, in con&s;equence of a fall from high &s;caffoldings, without any external injury. In &s;uch acci|dents, an internal pre&s;&s;ure or &s;toppage of the vital functions, as breathing, and circulation of the blood, often produces a &s;tate of appar|ent death.&mdash;Even the &s;uppre&s;&s;ed pul&s;e in the arteries, imperceptible re&s;piration, the cold|ne&s;s and rigidity of the limbs, the want of contractibility in the pupil of the eye, the in|voluntary lo&s;s of excrementitious &s;ub&s;tances,&mdash;all the&s;e &s;ymptoms of approaching di&s;&s;olution &s;hould not di&s;courage us from trying the prop|er means of recovering the patient's life.

The following Chapters will, therefore, be exclu&s;ively devoted to Dietetics. My princi|pal object will be, to lay a &s;olid foundation for that important &s;cience, by inve&s;tigating and combating the chief prejudices, which have hitherto retarded the progre&s;s of this branch of knowledge. Hence, a <HI>Sy&s;tem of Di|etetics</HI> mu&s;t not only contain all tho&s;e rules, which are requi&s;ite to guide us in the pre&s;er|vation of health, together with &s;uch as relate to the choice of a proper mode of life, but &s;hould likewi&s;e inform us with regard to the beneficial or hurtful influence, which <HI>external objects</HI> produce on the health and life of man, and teach us the ju&s;t application, or practical u&s;e, of the&s;e objects.</P>
<P>DIETETICS include the whole of what the Ancients under&s;tood by the &s;ingular name of the SIX NON-NATURALS; namely, <HI>Air, Ali|ment, Exerci&s;e and Re&s;t, the Pa&s;&s;ions and Affec|tions of the Mind, Wakefulne&s;s and Sleep,</HI> and <HI>Repletion and Evacuation.</HI> Although the&s;e gen|eral heads do not compri&s;e, &s;trictly &s;peaking, every thing that relates to the different func|tions of the human body; yet they contain all &s;uch conditions of life, as are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e cir|cum&s;tances, which are connected with the health and well-being of the individual. In each of the&s;e particulars we are liable to com|mit errors, either by intemperate u&s;e, or an improper application.

means of in&s;uring heath, and of avoid|ing whatever may have a contrary tendency.</P>
<P>Our mode of life is no longer that natural and &s;imple one, which prevailed in the prim|itive ages of mankind; in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety &s;uch habits are &s;carcely conceivable. Man in a &s;tate of nature had little occa&s;ion to attend to his health; he wanted no rules for the pre&s;ervation of it; for, as the &s;eeds of di&s;|ea&s;es are rarely &s;cattered in &s;uch a &s;tate, in&s;tinct would be to him in mo&s;t ca&s;es a &s;ufficient guide.

all the&s;e circum&s;tances have greater or le&s;s in|fluence, conjointly or &s;eparately, not only on the pa&s;&s;ions, inclinations, and in&s;tinctive de&s;ires of individuals, but al&s;o on the general &s;tate of the health and phy&s;ical welfare of a people. By the pre&s;ent mode of living we are expo&s;ed to di&s;ea&s;es wholly unknown in the fir&s;t ages of the world, and we &s;uffer from a variety of complaints, originating either in artificial hab|its, or the con&s;traint under which we labour, in con&s;equence of blindly complying with the caprices of cu&s;tom, or fa&s;hion, without perhaps apprehending any ill con&s;equences from &s;uch pernicious practices.</P>
<P>Many ingenious writers have lately endeav|oured to point out the di&s;advantages ari&s;ing from cau&s;es apparently trivial. Thus the fa&s;h|ion of u&s;ing paint, hair-powder, and pomatum; of wearing ill-&s;haped &s;hoes, laced &s;tays, &amp;c. have de&s;ervedly incurred &s;evere ridicule and pointed cen&s;ure. The cu&s;tom of applying lead to earthen ve&s;&s;els has not e&s;caped their attention: the danger, however, re&s;ulting from the u&s;e of that &s;ub&s;tance, has been great|ly exaggerated. Writers, with the be&s;t in|tentions, have &s;ometimes, from an exce&s;s of zeal, de&s;canted on the wor&s;t &s;ide of the que&s;|tion only, by attributing to certain things many dangerous qualities, which in fact are owing to a great diver&s;ity of circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>This partial method of inquiring into the &s;ources of the evil, is, generally &s;peaking, a &s;erious error; as it not only leads to fal&s;e conclu&s;ions, but al&s;o draws our attention from other pre&s;&s;ing injuries, to which, in a more

<P>Many, and perhaps the greater number, of dietetic writers have fallen into another er|ror of an equally bad tendency. They judge of every thing, according to the agreeable or di&s;agreeable effect it produces on their own palates and con&s;titutions, and hence recom|mend their favourite articles to others; al|though what is &s;alutary in particular ca&s;es, may have a pernicious tendency, if pre&s;cribed indi&s;criminately.</P>
<P>The multiplicity of our-wants, all de&s;erving attention in a Dietetic Sy&s;tem, has al&s;o con|&s;iderably multiplied the rules of health. Of all living beings, indeed, none require &s;uch rules more than tho&s;e, who &s;ervilely &s;ubmit to the arbitrary mandates of luxury and fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>Many are the open and &s;ecret enemies to the health and pro&s;perity of man. Even the mo&s;t healthy, and tho&s;e who rigidly adhere to the rules of Diet and Regimen, cannot al|together evade their attacks. Hence we &s;hould make it our &s;tudy, to acquaint our|&s;elves minutely with every thing, &s;o as to be enabled to judge of its good or bad qualities. Whatever we are obliged to have more im|mediately about and around us, ranks in this cla&s;s: the arrangement of our dwelling places, beds, clothes, furniture, &amp;c. in the choice of which we are le&s;s accu&s;tomed to con&s;ult what nature requires, or to contrive what may be mo&s;t likely to promote the welfare of the body, than to follow fa&s;hion, vanity, or our own habits.</P>

Some of our organs of &s;en&s;e, and other fa|culties of the body, mu&s;t unavoidably &s;uffer from inattention to a proper mode of living in general. From the great exertions, to which we often &s;ubject them (the eyes, for in&s;tance, in reading) they are liable to a vari|ety of accidents, and frequently become de|bilitated and impaired.

It may be laid down as a preliminary ob|&s;ervation, that the rules contained in this work are not to be con&s;idered as &s;trictly ap|plicable, in every in&s;tance, to the particular &s;ituation of any individual, or as e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;ervation of his health.&mdash;It is not &s;o much the healthy, as the valetu|dinary and infirm, who &s;tand in need of mi|nute precepts for their conduct; and even the latter ought not to engage too &s;olicitou&s;|ly in their compliance with them; &s;ince it is only a very limited number that require &s;uch accurate attention.</P>
<P>A vigorous and per&s;evering method of in|uring our&s;elves to the unavoidable difficulties and diver&s;ified accidents of life, is of greater importance to the pre&s;ervation of health, than any dietetical rules whatever.

<HEAD>Of Air in general.</HEAD>
<P>AS &s;oon as an infant enters into the world, the air of the atmo&s;phere penetrates into his lungs, filled up till then with aqueous mucus, and renders them fit for the circula|tion of the blood, which immediately com|mences. From that moment the alternate ex|ten&s;ion and contraction of the brea&s;t and lungs, the in&s;piration and expiration of the air, or in other words, the function of <HI>re&s;pi|ration,</HI> becomes indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;ervation of animal life. While the child remained within its mother, it required no external air. As &s;oon, however, as it has drawn breath, as &s;oon as the lungs are open|ed, the act of re&s;piration begins, is con&s;tantly renewed through life, and can never ab&s;olute|ly cea&s;e, but with death. As, therefore, air is the principal medium by which animal life is &s;upported, it becomes highly import|ant to acquire correct ideas of this refined &s;ub&s;tance, that pervades all the parts of ani|mate and inanimate matter, and is &s;o e&s;&s;en|tial to man, for the pre&s;ervation of both his life and health.</P>
<P><HI>Air</HI> is that colourle&s;s, tran&s;parent, compre&s;|&s;ible, heavy, and ela&s;tic fluid, which every

The difference of the weight of the air, which our bodies &s;u&s;tain at one time more than at another, is al&s;o very great; that between the greate&s;t and the lea&s;t pre&s;&s;ure of air upon our bod|ies has been proved to be equal to 3902lb. Hence it is &s;o far from being a wonder, that we &s;ometimes &s;uffer in our health by a change of weather, that it is the greate&s;t miracle we do not always do &s;o. For when we con&s;ider, that our bodies are &s;ometimes pre&s;&s;ed upon by near a ton and a half weight more than at another, and that this variation is often very &s;udden, it is &s;urpri&s;ing that every &s;uch change &s;hould not entirely break the frame of our bodies to pieces. And the ve&s;&s;els of our bodies, being &s;o much &s;trained by an increa&s;ed pre&s;&s;ure, would &s;tagnate the blood up to the very heart, and the circulation would quite cea&s;e, if Nature had not wi&s;ely contrived, that when the re&s;i&s;tance to the circulating blood is greate&s;t, the <HI>impetus,</HI> by which the heart contracts, &s;hould be &s;o too. For upon increa&s;e of the weight of the air, the lungs will be more forcibly ex|panded, and thereby the blood more intimately broken and divided; &s;o that it becomes fitter for the more fluid &s;ecretions, &s;uch as that of the (&s;uppo&s;ed) nervous fluid, by which the heart will be more &s;trongly contracted, and the blood's motion towards the &s;urface of the body being ob&s;tructed, it will pa&s;s in greater quantity to the brain, where the pre&s;&s;ure of the air is taken off by the <HI>cranium,</HI> up|on which account al&s;o more &s;pirits will be &s;eparated, and thus the heart too more enabled to carry on the circulation through all pa&s;&s;|able canals, while &s;ome others towards the &s;urface are ob&s;tructed."</P>

<HI>Oxygen</HI> is much better adapted to the re&s;pi|ration of animals, than common atmo&s;pheric air. If two animals be inclo&s;ed in ve&s;&s;els, one of which contains pure oxygen, and the other common atmo&s;pheric air, in proportions equal to the &s;ize of the animals, the former in the oxygen will be found to live from &s;ix to &s;ev|en times longer, than the latter in common air. It is properly this oxygen which we in|&s;pire, and which is the grand &s;upport of an|imal life.

<HI>Azote,</HI> by others called phlogi&s;ticated, me|phitic, corrupted, or &s;uffocative air, is ab&s;o|lutely irre&s;pirable, and not mi&s;cible with wa|ter. It ari&s;es from the change which atmo&s;|pherical air undergoes in every proce&s;s of combu&s;tion, putrefaction, and re&s;piration, whether produced by nature or art.</P>
<P>Azote enters into no combination with wa|ter, but may be rendered le&s;s hurtful by &s;hak|ing it with that fluid: this accounts in &s;ome mea&s;ure for the &s;alubrity of the &s;ea-air.

We &s;hould be extremely cautious in entering &s;uch places; as di&s;ea&s;es of the brea&s;t and lungs are too frequently the con&s;equences of neglect, ob&s;tinacy, or igno|rance.</P>
<P>The <HI>Carbonic acid</HI> of the French is the <HI>fixed air</HI> of Dr. BLACK, and the <HI>A&euml;rial acid</HI> of BERG|MAN. This &s;pecies of air is mi&s;cible with wa|ter; but in its pure &s;tate equally irre&s;pirable as the Azote. It derives its origin, partly from the vinous fermentation of vegetables, and &s;ome animal &s;ub&s;tances, and partly from the mild alkaline &s;alts and earths combined with acids. Much of this air is found in mines, where it frequently di&s;tre&s;&s;es the workmen by its &s;uffocating qualities. It is al&s;o ob&s;erved in mo&s;t mineral waters, where a &s;tratum of it &s;ometimes &s;wims upon the &s;urface of the well. The&s;e waters, as well as fermented liquors
<PB N="152" REF="039111_0182_10139FA3201E9860">
which contain a con&s;iderable portion of fixed air, receive from it the well known pungency &s;o agreeable to the palate. Hence flat and &s;poiled beer, or wine, may be corrected and re&s;tored to its former bri&s;kne&s;s, by the addi|tion of fixed air evolved from chalk and vit|riolic acid, or by mixing it with new beer or wine in a &s;tate of fermentation.</P>
<P>This &s;pecies of air quickly extingui&s;hes fire, and &s;trongly attracts the fumes ari&s;ing from candles. As it is unfit for re&s;piration, ani|mals cannot live in it. The warm-blooded animals die in it much &s;ooner than any other; tho&s;e of an amphibious kind &s;omewhat later; in&s;ects are not irrecoverably killed by it; ir|ritability is &s;uddenly de&s;troyed, and the heart of an animal &s;o deprived of life, though &s;till warm, no longer exhibits any &s;igns of mo|tion.</P>
<P>There is another &s;pecies of mephitic air, which is not mi&s;cible with water, which burns with a flame, and if mixed either with atmo&s;|pheric air, or oxygen gas, in&s;tantly catches fire, and is exploded: this has received the name of inflammable air,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This air may be obtained in a great variety of ways, from all &s;ub&s;tances liable to inflammation, or containing combu&s;tible matter, by means of heat, fermentation, acids, and the like; nay, even from metals, by directing the &s;team of boiling water through a red-hot metallic tube.&mdash;It is the &s;pontaneous production of nature; through|out her <HI>three</HI> kingdoms.

Neither is any thing &s;o much calculated to corrupt and poi&s;on the air, to fill it with noxious vapours, and to generate di&s;ea&s;es, as the <HI>burying-grounds</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed within the walls of populous cities, where human bodies are depo&s;ited, as if with an apparent de&s;ign to produce an atmo&s;phere, which is particularly fatal to the tender lungs of children, and in no &s;mall degree hurtful to adults.</P>
<P>As the ma&s;s of atmo&s;pheric air is ince&s;&s;antly corrupted by the re&s;piration of men and ani|mals, by the burning of &s;o many natural and artificial fires, by the di&s;&s;olution and putrefac|tion of innumerable &s;ub&s;tances, and by vari|ous other phlogi&s;tic or de&s;oxygenating pro|ce&s;&s;es, it would at length become altogether incompetent for its original de&s;ignation, if Nature had not provided effectual means for its improvement and re&s;toration. Among the mo&s;t powerful of the&s;e, we may place the growth and vegetation of plants.&mdash;For this very important di&s;covery we are indebted to Dr. PRIESTLEY, who was &s;o fortunate as to hit upon it, after he had long employed him|&s;elf
<PB N="155" REF="039111_0185_10139FE7F7C826C0">
in fruitle&s;s attempts, to improve and re|&s;tore corrupted air, by artificial means. He found that air, rendered mortal by the breath|ing of animals which had expired in it, was again &s;o completely re&s;tored by the vegetation of plants, that, after the lap&s;e of &s;ome days, an animal could live in it with equal ea&s;e, and for the &s;ame length of time, as in a &s;imilar quantity of common atmo&s;pheric air.</P>
<P>The&s;e experiments, indeed, did not &s;ucceed with &s;ome Naturali&s;ts; and Prie&s;tly him&s;elf, upon repeating them with different plants, found the re&s;ults rather varying and doubt|ful: but Dr. INGENHOUZ removed the great|er part of the&s;e difficulties, by his book, "Ex|periments upon Vegetables, 8vo. London, 1779." This ingenious philo&s;opher remark|ed, 1&s;t, That mo&s;t plants have the property of correcting bad air within a few hours, when they are expo&s;ed to the <HI>light of the &s;un;</HI> but that, on the contrary, <HI>during the night,</HI> or in the <HI>&s;hade,</HI> they corrupt the common air of the atmo&s;phere;&mdash;2d, That plants, from their own &s;ub&s;tance, afford a very pure dephlogi&s;|ticated air, or Oxygen, when expo&s;ed to the rays of the &s;un; but a very impure air or Azote at night, or in the &s;hade;&mdash;3d, That not all the parts of plants, but only the green &s;talks of leaves, particularly through the &s;ides oppo&s;ite to the &s;oil, produce this beneficial ef|fect;&mdash;4th, That the di&s;engagement of pure or vital air does not commence until the &s;un has been &s;ome time above the horizon; that it cea&s;es altogether with the termination of day-light; and that the di&s;advantage ari&s;ing
<PB N="156" REF="039111_0186_10139FA953537E98">
from the impure exhalation of plants, during the night, is far exceeded by the great advan|tage they afford during the day; in&s;omuch, that the impure air, generated by a plant dur|ing the whole night, &s;carcely amounts to a hundredth part of the pure vital air or Oxy|gen, exhaled from the &s;ame plant in two hours of a &s;erene day.&mdash;Thus we di&s;cover a mo&s;t &s;triking phenomenon in the oeconomy of na|ture; &s;ince the vegetation of plants continu|ally counteracts the noxious effects of re&s;pira|tion, combu&s;tion, and putrefaction.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It &s;hould be recollected here, that when the growth of plants is interrupted by the cold of winter, &s;o that they no longer generate a beneficial air to purify the atmo&s;phere, Nature has ordained it, that this very cold of the winter it&s;elf contains the mo&s;t effectual virtues to &s;top the progre&s;s of putrefaction. We further find, that in the mo&s;t unwhole&s;ome, and particularly in mar&s;hy countries, tho&s;e very plants appear to be very profu&s;ely di&s;tributed, which mo&s;t em|inently po&s;&s;e&s;s the property of purifying the air. And as the pure air, or oxygen, is of greater &s;pecific gravity than the common air of the atmo&s;phere, it is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with the operations of nature, that the oxygen &s;hould &s;ettle towards the lower &s;ide of the leaves of plants.</P></NOTE> In this manner, the atmo&s;phere is con&s;tantly pre&s;erv|ed in that nece&s;&s;ary &s;tate of purity and tem|perature, which is the mo&s;t &s;alutary both to animals and vegetables.</P>
<P>We have learnt the effects produced on the human body by the atmo&s;phere and the changes of the weather, partly from ob&s;ervations made by our&s;elves and others, and partly from their influence on inanimate matter, by which we can judge in &s;ome mea&s;ure of its analogous effects on the human frame; but we &s;hould not thence conclude that our knowledge, in this re&s;pect, is either complete or infallible. Ob|&s;ervations may frequently deceive us, &s;ince the
<PB N="157" REF="039111_0187_10139EF7081A10F0">
human body, be&s;ides the weather, is ince&s;&s;ant|ly expo&s;ed to the effects of other external agents, which may ea&s;ily elude our attention. Further, the atmo&s;phere &s;urrounding us, be|&s;ides the properties cognizable by our &s;en&s;es, or di&s;coverable by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of particular in&s;truments, may al&s;o be impregnated with &s;ub&s;tances which have hitherto e&s;caped our re&s;earches, and which neverthele&s;s may have the power to effect important changes. La&s;t|ly, we ought not to con&s;ider the arguments deduced from analogy as &s;trictly conclu&s;ive; we &s;hould remember, that the effects of ex|ternal objects on the living animal fibre are, in many in&s;tances, totally different from tho&s;e which they produce on lifele&s;s or inanimate bodies.</P>
<P>Recommending the&s;e general remarks to the con&s;ideration of the reader, I proceed to con&s;ider tho&s;e particular and po&s;itive effects, which the different &s;tates of the atmo&s;phere produce on our frame, and in what manner they influence our health.</P>
<P><HI>Warm air</HI> relaxes the &s;olid parts of the body, and occa&s;ions a &s;tronger circulation of the flu|ids. <HI>Heat</HI> is chiefly oppre&s;&s;ive to the Nerves; hence the tender and infirm &s;uffer &s;everely in hot weather; hence ari&s;e hy&s;teric and hypo|chondriac complaints, convul&s;ions, and diar|rhoeas. <HI>Cold</HI> renders bodies more compact, particularly the &s;olid parts of the animal &s;truc|ture, &s;uch as the mu&s;cles, nerves, bones, &amp;c. They become more ela&s;tic in winter; the ap|petite for food is &s;tronger, and dige&s;tion ea&s;ier and quicker. On the contrary, the re&s;i&s;tance
<PB N="158" REF="039111_0188_10139FAAD84C2378">
of the fluid parts becomes &s;o great, that even the increa&s;ed powers of the &s;olids cannot over-come it, if the cold be too violent. In winter the blood is much di&s;po&s;ed to inflammations; hence &s;titches in the &s;ide, inflammatory &s;ore throats, rheumati&s;ms, &amp;c. In per&s;ons who take little exerci&s;e, the fluids are apt to &s;tag|nate, and the &s;olids to chill during the win|ter;&mdash;upon the whole, however, the effects of cold weather may be rendered le&s;s hurtful, and even &s;alutary to the body, if proper ex|erci&s;e be not neglected.</P>
<P><HI>Damp</HI> or <HI>moi&s;t air</HI> &s;uddenly relaxes and de|bilitates; it occa&s;ions a &s;lowne&s;s in the cir|culation of the fluids, which gives ri&s;e to ob|&s;tructions, and impedes both the circulation of the blood and the &s;ecretion of humours, by checking in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration. If the moi&s;ture of the air increa&s;es, we experience an unaccountable torpor and <HI>ennui;</HI> with the lo&s;s of energy we lo&s;e our gaiety, and the mind is depre&s;&s;ed with the body. Damp places and di&s;tricts are always unwhole&s;ome, but more particularly &s;o in cold weather. Moi&s;|ture, by dimini&s;hing per&s;piration, produces di&s;orders of the throat, the brea&s;t, and the abdomen. But the mo&s;t dangerous and fatal effects on the human body have been ob&s;erv|ed to ari&s;e from moi&s;t air accompanied with hot weather; for, when moi&s;ture has impair|ed our energy, heat increa&s;es the evil in a great degree, by opening the pores through which the moi&s;ture penetrates into the body, and predi&s;po&s;ing every part of it to putrefac|tion and di&s;&s;olution. This accounts for the
<PB N="159" REF="039111_0189_10139FEB0798E688">
great mortality prevalent during the hot &s;ea|&s;on at Batavia, and &s;ome of the We&s;t India i&s;lands.</P>
<P><HI>Dry</HI> and <HI>cool air,</HI> from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a due de|gree of ela&s;ticity, promotes in an extraordi|nary degree the &s;erenity and alertne&s;s of mind and body; hence it is found uncommonly &s;alubrious to hypochondriacs. But a dry and very cold air generates inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es; becau&s;e it in&s;pi&s;&s;ates the blood. Dry and hot air affects us like heat, and enervates the body. But a dry air, which is not too warm, is both agreeable and healthy.</P>
<P>Great and <HI>&s;udden changes</HI> from a warm to a cold, or from a light to a heavy air, are high|ly injurious to valetudinarians, and even to the healthy. Soldiers in camp, and, &s;ome|times, travellers, feel very &s;everely the bad effects of cold and moi&s;t night air, after long marches and journeys. Weakly and infirm per&s;ons have frequently ominous &s;en&s;ations, previous to any remarkable change of the air.</P>
<P>A moderately heavy and ela&s;tic air is the mo&s;t agreeable and &s;alutary to the human bo|dy; hence nature has not a&s;&s;igned us our con|&s;tant re&s;idence on the &s;ummits of mountains. Yet a light and rarefied air, &s;uch as is felt on the highe&s;t mountains, is not &s;o unfit for re&s;|piration, nor does it manife&s;t &s;o noxious an influence on the human body, as was formerly believed. The late&s;t travellers a&s;&s;ure us of the contrary, and &s;peak in deci&s;ive terms of the &s;alutary effects of the air, during a &s;hort &s;tay in tho&s;e elevated regions.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="039111_0190_10139FADA56CBFE0">
Among the different WINDS&mdash;which are nothing el&s;e but &s;trong commotions of the air&mdash;the long continued <HI>North wind</HI> is compara|tively the mo&s;t whole&s;ome; it purifies the at|mo&s;phere of noxious vapours, renders the air &s;erene and dry, and thus imparts to the hu|man body ela&s;ticity, vigour, activity, and a lively colour. It is, however, trouble&s;ome to per&s;ons of delicate habits, and occa&s;ions in them coughs, inflammation of the throat, pains in the &s;ide, ob&s;tructions, and febrile di&s;|ea&s;es. The <HI>South wind</HI> weakens and relaxes the body, and is very apt to produce catarrhal affections. The <HI>Morning wind</HI> is very drying; but <HI>Evening winds</HI> are cool and moi&s;t, being frequently accompanied with rain and change|able weather. All the&s;e winds differ materi|ally in their qualities, from local circum&s;tan|ces, and accordingly as they blow over a Con|tinent, over the Ocean, or over high moun|tains and icy regions, from which they carry along with them more or le&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> cold and hu|mid particles. But upon the whole, too dry weather is always more healthy, than that which is too moi&s;t.</P>
<P>Of the four SEASONS of the year, the <HI>Au|tumn</HI> is the mo&s;t unhealthy; becau&s;e then the particles of per&s;piration not only remain on the body, but are in a &s;tate inclining to pu|trefaction. This di&s;advantage, however, may be ea&s;ily obviated by guarding our&s;elves with proper dre&s;s and choo&s;ing a &s;uitable diet. Too light a dre&s;s, and too thin &s;tockings, are not advi&s;able at this &s;ea&s;on. The <HI>Spring &s;ea|&s;on</HI> is, in general, the mo&s;t healthy. Spring,
<PB N="161" REF="039111_0191_10139FEEB58D3698">
and the beginning of <HI>Summer,</HI> are mo&s;t &s;aluta|ry to children and young per&s;ons; while the Summer, and the beginning of <HI>Autumn,</HI> agree be&s;t with the aged. The latter end of Au|tumn, and the beginning of <HI>Winter,</HI> are com|monly the mo&s;t healthy &s;ea&s;ons to per&s;ons of a middle age.</P>
<P>It has been remarked by medical men, that certain di&s;ea&s;es appear and di&s;appear accord|ing to the different &s;ea&s;ons. Thus, putrid and bilious di&s;orders prevail in Summer; in|flammatory di&s;ea&s;es in Winter, and the ca|tarrhal, mucous, and ga&s;tric or &s;tomachic af|fections, in Spring and Autumn. It has been further ob&s;erved, that in Spring the blood u&s;ually circulates more freely; hence proba|bly aro&s;e the ancient practice of blood-letting, and taking laxatives at certain regular peri|ods; both of which I have already pointed out, in the preceding Chapter, as dangerous in their tendency, and always hurtful to the healthy.</P>
<P>As the vegetable kingdom is renewed in Spring, and as vegetation, in general, is mo&s;t lively in that &s;ea&s;on, there can be little doubt, that the pure vital air is then mo&s;t copiou&s;ly evolved, by means of the &s;olar light and heat. Hence it follows, that the vernal air is more whole&s;ome than that of Autumn, which is &s;aturated with corrupted and putrifying par|ticles. Still the cold of Autumn, and the frequent winds then prevalent, prove ex|tremely efficacious in counteracting the bane|ful effects of corruption and putrefaction.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="039111_0192_10139FAF2AC53418">
If the temperature of the air corre&s;pond with the natural con&s;titution of the &s;ea&s;on, we may expect what is called a healthy year, and that the prevalent di&s;ea&s;es will be of a mild nature; but if the weather does not agree with the general laws of the &s;ea&s;on; if, for in&s;tance, the Winter prove warm, or at lea&s;t moderate, or the Spring cold and &s;evere, with &s;udden alternations of heat, we may ex|pect to find the year pretty generally marked with &s;erious and ob&s;tinate di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>The temperature of the air depends not a little on the natural &s;ituation of the country, whether it lie high or low; whether its moun|tains oppo&s;e or give a free pa&s;&s;age to the winds; whether it contains flowing or &s;tagnant wa|ters or mora&s;&s;es, and whether it is open or covered with woods.&mdash;Country air, upon the whole, is always purer than that of towns, narrow &s;treets, and crowded buildings.</P>
<P>All <HI>&s;trongly-&s;cented bodies</HI> are more or le&s;s pernicious; as well tho&s;e of a di&s;agreeable &s;mell, as the greater number of fragrant per|fumes. The latter, if too &s;trong, are more particularly dangerous, as a &s;en&s;e of di&s;gu&s;t does not naturally incline us to avoid them. Among the&s;e may be comprehended all veg|etable odours &s;trongly volatile and pungent, and which thereby &s;timulate and &s;tupify the nerves. Hence people, who carry large no&s;e|gays in the hot days of &s;ummer, are apt to feel them&s;elves variou&s;ly and &s;trongly affected, particularly with drow&s;ine&s;s. From this ap|parently innocent cau&s;e, head-achs, vertigoes, fainting-&s;its, and apoplexies have frequently
<PB N="163" REF="039111_0193_10139FF29320F130">
been produced in per&s;ons of a plethoric habit. The&s;e, as well as people of a delicate con&s;titu|tion, are liable to &s;uch affections, from the fragrance of many bal&s;amic plants, but par|ticularly from the &s;trong &s;cent of lilies, ro&s;es, pinks, the blo&s;&s;oms of oranges, hyacinths, and the like.&mdash;Many flowers emit a more power|ful fragrance in the night than in the day-time, and the effluvia of &s;everal trees and other vegetable bodies are peculiarly dangerous, and &s;ometimes mortal. Of this nature are the walnut and yew trees, under who&s;e &s;hades per&s;ons have actually died, who had fallen a&s;leep; and likewi&s;e the deadly <HI>Upas</HI> of Suri|nam, and the no le&s;s poi&s;onous <HI>Manchineel</HI> tree of the We&s;t Indies.</P>
<P>Aromatics of every kind taint the air in a &s;imilar manner, introducing into the human body particles foreign to its nature, all exciting more or le&s;s an inclination to &s;leep. Saffron and hops have &s;ometimes proved fatal; the former in particular has often produced a &s;leep terminating in death, in tho&s;e incautious indi|viduals, who had lain down in the ware-hou&s;es or upon the bags, in which it was packed. Ambergris and mu&s;k are al&s;o, on account of their powerful fragrance, very hurtful to per|&s;ons of an irritable and nervous temperament.</P>
<P>Dwellings in the vicinity of lakes, fens, and mar&s;hes, are expo&s;ed to all the noxious effects of a moi&s;t atmo&s;phere, namely, to the various &s;pecies of intermittent fevers or agues;&mdash;on the other hand, it has been ob&s;erved, that per&s;ons living on the banks of rivers, though at times &s;ubject to the&s;e, are not very liable to
<PB N="164" REF="039111_0194_10139FB3CE505A38">
other di&s;ea&s;es, and that running water has a tendency to purify the air, when it is &s;aturated with inflammable particles.</P>
<P>Too &s;udden a tran&s;ition from warm to cold air, or the rever&s;e, is pernicious; but to ex|change, however &s;uddenly, an unhealthy at|mo&s;phere for a healthier, is at all times &s;afe and highly advi&s;able. Numberle&s;s in&s;tances have proved, that &s;uch as were con&s;tantly in|di&s;po&s;ed in the corrupted air of a town very quickly recovered their health, on removing to the purer atmo&s;phere of the country. Yet the que&s;tion, <HI>Which air is the mo&s;t whole&s;ome to live in?</HI> will admit only of a conditional an|&s;wer. We mu&s;t attend not only to the par|ticular con&s;titution of the air, but al&s;o to the nature and habits of the individual. Neither &s;hould we too ha&s;tily pronounce every air unwhole&s;ome, that does not appear to agree <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">with us. The air of every climate, whether hot, cold, or temperate, may be called healthy, provided it be pure and clear, and occa&s;ionally agitated by wind: but a gro&s;s atmo&s;phere, and one loaded with animal or vegetable ex|halations, is certainly deleterious. After all, perhaps the longevity of the inhabitants may be con&s;idered as the be&s;t evidence of a healthy di&s;trict. Thus we find uncommonly long-lived per&s;ons in high countries, or &s;uch as are vi&s;ited by frequent winds, and al&s;o in &s;mall &s;ea-port towns. In villages and places thinly inhabited, the proportion of aged people is con&s;iderably greater than in cities or populous towns. This may be a&s;cribed partly to a le&s;s degree of corruption in the air, and partly to
<PB N="165" REF="039111_0195_10139FF418C63190">
a more &s;imple mode of life prevailing in &s;uch places: for wealth and riches, the concomi|tant effects of which are greater luxury and extravagance in living, u&s;ually keep pace with the increa&s;e of population; and if the numer|ous chimney-fires of our populous cities did not &s;erve as &s;o many well-contrived machines for rarefying the atmo&s;phere, incalculable mi&s;chiefs mu&s;t inevitably en&s;ue.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Improvement of Air in Dwelling-Hou&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>A HOUSE built on a ri&s;ing ground, on a healthy &s;oil, in an open, dry country, and neither expo&s;ed to the greate&s;t degree of cold in winter, nor to the highe&s;t point of heat in &s;ummer, may be &s;aid to &s;tand in a healthy &s;it|uation. Hence tho&s;e apartments are the mo&s;t healthful as well as comfortable to the indi|vidual, which enjoy a pure and free circula|tion of air in &s;ummer, and the cheering rays of the &s;un in winter: the heat of &s;ummer be|ing con&s;iderably tempered by the former, and the &s;everity of winter much abated by the latter. Farther, a proper &s;ize and height are requi&s;ite to con&s;titute a healthful apartment; for low rooms are detrimental to health, par|ticularly when inhabited by large families, and &s;eldom aired, or rather, which is fre|quently the ca&s;e, when all air is carefully ex|cluded by clo&s;e doors, &s;hutters, curtains, &amp;c. The mo&s;t proper place of re&s;idence in winter is one with a &s;outhern a&s;pect, not only as be|ing
<PB N="166" REF="039111_0196_10139FB664253838">
more dry, but al&s;o more cheerful, and therefore attended with a favourable influence on the &s;pirits. In &s;ummer, the &s;ituation of a room may be cho&s;en either to the North or to the Ea&s;t, the latter of which is preferable, becau&s;e it admits the fir&s;t enlivening rays of the Sun.</P>
<P>Although it is not in every per&s;on's power to choo&s;e his habitation agreeably to the laws of health; yet this choice of a pure and healthy air is not &s;ufficiently attended to, and it cer|tainly de&s;erves as much con&s;ideration in pur|cha&s;ing an e&s;tate or country-hou&s;e as the qual|ity of the &s;oil or other lucrative advantages.</P>
<P>The local con&s;titution of the air depends not merely on the exhalations of the &s;oil it&s;elf, but likewi&s;e on the different vapours, con|ducted to and blended with it by the winds, from adjoining places. Thus in a dry and &s;andy country, con&s;idered of it&s;elf as healthy, the air may be rendered extremely unwhole|&s;ome from the vicinity of mar&s;hes or other &s;tagnant waters.</P>
<P>The better to judge of the &s;alubrity of the air in any di&s;trict, we &s;hould examine the properties of the wells and &s;prings; for both <HI>air</HI> and <HI>water</HI> ab&s;orb the &s;aline and mineral particles of the &s;oil. We may pretty certainly conclude, that a country producing good wa|ter, enjoys likewi&s;e a &s;alubrious air; and as the be&s;t water is ta&s;tele&s;s, &s;o the pure&s;t air is free from any &s;mell whatever.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t certain marks, by which to di&s;|tingui&s;h whether the air in rooms be damp or not, are the following: the walls or tape&s;|try

change their colour; bread in clo&s;ets ac|quires a mouldy &s;urface; &s;punges in the rooms retain their moi&s;ture; loaf-&s;ugar turns &s;oft; iron ru&s;ts; bra&s;s and copper acquire a green colour, or verdigris; and wooden fur|niture moulders and crumbles to pieces.</P>
<P>The &s;itting-room ought, if po&s;&s;ible, to be above the ground floor, or in the &s;econd &s;tory; it &s;hould be &s;o con&s;tructed as to admit a free current of air; but if this cannot be done, it &s;hould be frequently aired by opening the windows in dry weather, or by fumigating the room, either with vinegar dropped upon warm &s;tones, or evaporated in a ba&s;on over a lamp, or with &s;ugar, juniper-berries, and the like.</P>
<P>Every room is filled with <HI>three</HI> different <HI>&s;trata</HI> of air: 1. The lower part of the room contains the heavie&s;t &s;pecies of air, namely, fixed or carbonic acid gas, particularly in apartments &s;ituated on the ground-floor, or even under ground; 2. The middle part of the room is filled with the lighter atmo&s;pheric air; and 3. The uppermo&s;t &s;tratum contains the lighte&s;t or inflammable air, the mo&s;t cor|rupted of the three, in con&s;equence of the proce&s;&s;es it has undergone by re&s;piration and combu&s;tion. In lofty apartments this con|taminated &s;pecies of air is not in&s;pired by the lungs; becau&s;e the middle &s;tratum, or the mo&s;t whole&s;ome of the three, extends to a height above that of a man.</P>
<P>A continual change of the air, by opening the doors and occa&s;ionally the windows, how|ever advi&s;able, is yet not &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve

a healthy atmo&s;phere in an apartment. For this important purpo&s;e the following improve|ments may be &s;ugge&s;ted as u&s;eful: 1&s;t, Small apertures in the ceiling of the room, or through the walls clo&s;e to the ceiling, in an oblique direction, &s;o that the rain and &s;now cannot penetrate into it; 2d, Ventilators, that is, &s;mall moveable wheels made of bra&s;s or &s;heet-iron, which are applied to &s;ome part of the window-panes, and &s;et in motion by the pre&s;&s;ure of the external air. This is an ex|cellent contrivance to introduce fre&s;h atmo&s;|pheric air into a room, by occa&s;ionally open|ing and &s;hutting the door. The mo&s;t proper height for placing the&s;e ventilators is about &s;even feet from the floor; 3d, Air-tubes run|ning in a &s;traight direction from the door to the fire-place, or rather to the wall of the chimney, and concealed under the floor of the room. As &s;uch tubes, however, are very expen&s;ive, and appear better calculated to con|vey the &s;moke up the chimney, after all means have been tried in vain, than to conduct the corrupted air from the upper part of a room, I &s;hall mention a better and much ea&s;ier me|thod of effecting this purpo&s;e. It is a late di&s;covery of a phy&s;ician in France, who con|trived it with a view to &s;ave the great expen&s;e of ventilating or airing large wards in ho&s;pit|als, filled with patients who laboured under putrid di&s;tempers, particularly in the heat of &s;ummer. He cau&s;ed a number of &s;mall holes to be made in the uppermo&s;t part of the win|dow-frames; into the&s;e holes he placed from without an equal number of funnels, pre&s;ent|ing
<PB N="169" REF="039111_0199_1013A0E479682EA8">
an aperture of nine or twelve inches di|ameter, and terminating in the in&s;ide almo&s;t in a point, or at lea&s;t in an opening not ex|ceeding the &s;ize of a &s;mall quill. By means of the&s;e &s;imple machines, the air in the &s;ick rooms was &s;o effectually renewed, by the great and con&s;tant pre&s;&s;ure of atmo&s;pheric air from without, that any other artificial proce&s;s for correcting the putrid air in a large ho&s;pital was judged to be unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Above all things, the windows and doors of &s;itting and bed-rooms, when it can be done conveniently, ought to be left open for a cer|tain &s;pace of time, every day. This, howev|er, requires to be done at the proper time, neither too early in the morning, nor when it grows dark in the evening, during the ver|nal and autumnal months; nor at the time when the horizon is over&s;pread with a thick fog. The windows &s;hould be opened, when the air is pure and &s;erene; or, in general, when there is le&s;s danger to be apprehended from the external air than from that within. Sometimes it may be proper to make u&s;e of what is called <HI>pumping</HI> the room, or moving the door backward and forward for &s;ome minutes together; but in &s;pring and autumn, our &s;itting-rooms, and even in winter, bed-rooms, ought to be perflated every clear day, by currents of fre&s;h air, for a con&s;iderable time.</P>
<P>In the hot days of &s;ummer, the windows may be opened early in the morning and in the evening, in order to cool and refre&s;h the heated air of the room by that from without.
<PB N="170" REF="039111_0200_1013A03BC9900750">
It is however not &s;afe (and has &s;ometimes proved fatal) to leave the windows of a bed-room open at night during the &s;ummer-months, as there is no &s;mall hazard of check|ing per&s;piration by the cool night-air; the &s;u&s;ceptibility of the pores being then very much increa&s;ed by the heat of the day, and the warmth of the bed. Rooms which we inhabit in the day-time may be &s;afely left open during the night. In &s;ummer-hou&s;es, or &s;uch as are &s;urrounded with plants and trees, it will be proper not to open the windows of bed or other rooms, till &s;ome time after &s;un-ri&s;e, and to &s;hut them at &s;un-&s;et; they require al&s;o to be opened and &s;hut &s;ooner in hazy than in &s;erene weather.</P>
<P>The airing of apartments &s;hould not be ne|glected even in winter, as coal-fires alone are not &s;ufficient to carry off the corrupted parti|cles of air, unle&s;s they be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by ventila|tors.&mdash;Here I mu&s;t oppo&s;e and contradict a prevailing, yet mi&s;taken notion, that fire in a room where the windows are open, introdu|ces moi&s;t air. On the contrary, the mo&s;t proper time for opening the windows is after lighting up a bri&s;k fire; as the warmer air of the room will then be powerfully attracted by the colder atmo&s;pheric air, and the cor|rupt particles of the air within mo&s;t &s;peedily di&s;&s;ipated.</P>
<P>In <HI>moi&s;t</HI> and <HI>cold</HI> air, the dre&s;s &s;hould be &s;omewhat warmer than u&s;ual: Flannel may then be worn with double advantage next the &s;kin, and the rooms we inhabit &s;hould be warmed, or at lea&s;t fumigated, with the ber|ries
<PB N="171" REF="039111_0201_10139FF8444B22E8">
of Juniper or &s;imilar &s;hrubs. Fumigation is likewi&s;e attended with this advantage, that it contributes to dry and in &s;ome degree to warm the air.</P>
<P>In <HI>moi&s;t</HI> and <HI>warm</HI> air the explo&s;ion of a lit|tle gunpowder will be of u&s;e, or vinegar may be evaporated with greater &s;afety, and the floor and walls &s;prinkled over with this ex|cellent anti&s;eptic.</P>
<P><HI>Hot</HI> and <HI>dry</HI> air may be tempered by pla|cing ve&s;&s;els filled with cold water in different parts of a room; or, as is often practi&s;ed in hot climates, by &s;prinkling water over the floor. The greater or le&s;s degree of corrup|tion of the air, in an apartment, depends very much on the kind of labour or exerci&s;e per|formed in it: Six watchmakers will not cor|rupt the air nearly &s;o much as two carpenters would do in the &s;ame &s;pace and time; hence appears the nece&s;&s;ity of appropriating lofty rooms in&s;tead of low garrets, for the work|&s;hops of mechanics.</P>
<P>Green plants and flowers placed before the windows are both an agreeable and u&s;eful or|nament, if not of too &s;trong a fragrance. In &s;erene weather, it may be expedient to &s;trew fre&s;h plants (not flowers) in a dwelling-room, expo&s;ed to the rays of the &s;un, taking care, however, to remove them as &s;oon as the &s;un withdraws. This method of expo&s;ing plants, or even the branches of trees with green leaves, in apartments, may have a beneficial influence on valetudinarians, and particularly on a&s;thmatic per&s;ons, as vital air, or <HI>oxygen</HI> is
<PB N="172" REF="039111_0202_1013A03D4FBB4C48">
thereby generated, and introduced very grad|ually into the lungs.</P>
<P>Large trees with thick foliage &s;hould not be placed very near the windows of a hou&s;e; for, be&s;ides that they ob&s;truct the acce&s;s of day-light and fre&s;h air, and have thus a ten|dency to make the rooms damp, their exha|lations in the evening, and during the night, are by no means whole&s;ome. Trees planted at the di&s;tance of eight or ten yards from the hou&s;e, do not prevent the free acce&s;s of air; they pre&s;ent an agreeable object to the eye, and cannot be too much recommended, both on account of their cooling &s;hade in &s;ummer, and the &s;alutary exhalations they emit during the day.</P>
<P>It has been already mentioned, that the burning of candles corrupts the air; for which rea&s;on the cu&s;tom of illuminating a&s;&s;embly or other large rooms, with a <HI>&s;uperfluous</HI> number of candles, mu&s;t be very detrimental. This extravagance becomes &s;till more dangerous in places where, be&s;ide the crowd of people, great quantities of provi&s;ions, dre&s;&s;ed with the rich|e&s;t &s;pices of the Ea&s;t and We&s;t, contribute to &s;aturate the air with the mo&s;t heterogeneous particles. And as per&s;ons of tender lungs mu&s;t &s;uffer extremely in &s;uch an atmo&s;phere, it would be proper to provide all public rooms with a competent number of conic ventilators, of the de&s;cription before mentioned.</P>
<P>Strictly &s;peaking, we ought not to &s;it in the room where we dine, or take victuals, until it be aired again: tho&s;e who can afford this luxury, &s;hould be careful not to &s;tay for hours
<PB N="173" REF="039111_0203_10139FFDEDDFA700">
together over their bottle in the dining-room: the bad effects of &s;uch contaminated air are not perceived by the per&s;ons continuing their libations after dinner, but are very &s;en&s;ibly felt by any one coming in from the fre&s;h air.</P>
<P>It is no le&s;s unhealthy to &s;leep in a room where a quantity of <HI>green fruit</HI> is kept, a cir|cum&s;tance not attended to in country places, particularly by tho&s;e who deal in fruit. From its fragrance a portion of inflammable matter exhales, which &s;oon impregnates the air. Hence females of delicate habits have been known to faint, in approaching places where a few quinces were kept. For the &s;ame rea|&s;on, &s;tore-rooms and pantries are extremely unwhole&s;ome, if provi&s;ions of all kinds, ani|mal as well as vegetable, be kept in them; e&s;|pecially oil, candles, fat, fle&s;h meat, whether raw, boiled, or roa&s;ted, pa&s;try, and the like.</P>
<P>As foul linen readily imbibes the per&s;pira|ble matter of the &s;kin, it &s;hould never be &s;uf|fered to remain any time in a bed-room, or &s;itting-room.</P>
<P>If po&s;&s;ible, we &s;hould not &s;it through the day in a room in which we have &s;lept; as the bed-clothes, and particularly feather beds, very &s;lowly part with the exhalations they have imbibed during the night, neither is it &s;uffi|cient for purifying the air of the room, that it has been ever &s;o well aired in the morning.</P>
<P>The vapour of <HI>charcoal</HI> produces, particu|larly in clo&s;e apartments, dangerous and fre|quently fatal effects. It fills the atmo&s;phere with &s;ulphuric particles which may be in&s;pir|ed, but cannot be expired:&mdash;they retard the
<PB N="174" REF="039111_0204_1013A03FE3700D50">
motion of the blood-ve&s;&s;els, &s;tagnate the blood it&s;elf, penetrate into the head, and produce an acute pain, vertigo, and torpor. Hence the greate&s;t precaution is nece&s;&s;ary, where char|coal is u&s;ed, as innumerable fatal accidents have happened from this &s;ource. Dyers, who employ it for drying their cloth upon frames, &s;eldom fail to experience great injury to their health.</P>
<P>All employments, in which per&s;ons work among impure wool, oil, colours, and the like, are to a certain degree detrimental to health. Wa&s;hing, ironing, dre&s;&s;ing the hair with grea&s;y curling-irons, burning lamp oil, fre|quent painting of the walls, all &s;aturate the air of a room with pernicious damp and &s;ul|phuric vapours. From the change, which oil and candles in a &s;tate of combu&s;tion pro|duce in the colour of a white wall and white curtains, we may infer, that this fetid &s;team mu&s;t al&s;o penetrate into the human body, and if &s;o, mu&s;t materially affect it.</P>
<P>It farther de&s;erves to be remarked, that all damp vapours are prejudicial, although they &s;hould not in them&s;elves have a tendency to corrupt the air. Hence the keeping of wet linen, or even wet clothes, umbrellas, and the like, in dwelling-rooms, &s;hould by all means be avoided. Mechanics and others, who are obliged to dry wet things in their &s;trongly heated apartments&mdash;joiners, turners, potters, bookbinders, &amp;c. are particularly liable to &s;wellings, and other di&s;agreeable affections in the relaxed ve&s;&s;els of ab&s;orption.</P>

<HEAD>Of Heat and Cold.</HEAD>
<P>As ob&s;ervation and experience inform us, that immoderate heat relaxes the body, over|heats the blood, and ex&s;iccates or con&s;umes the other fluids; and that the people who live in temperate regions are more hardy and vigorous, and attain to a greater age, than the inhabitants of warmer climates; it fol|lows from the&s;e premi&s;es, that we ought not to enervate the human body by keeping it immoderately warm, by dre&s;&s;ing it with a &s;u|perfluity of clothes, by plunging it unnece&s;|&s;arily into hot baths, by u&s;ing too &s;trong fires in temperate weather, or lea&s;t of all, by &s;leep|ing in warm rooms, and perhaps on the mo&s;t heating of all &s;ub&s;tances, feather beds. The temperature of a &s;itting-room &s;hould not ex|ceed 60&deg; of Fahrenheit's thermometer; that of a bed-room may be about 50&deg;, as the me|dium temperature of our climate is between 50 and 55&deg;.</P>
<P>Although man is, no doubt, capable of in|uring him&s;elf to a very great degree of heat as well as of cold, yet &s;udden changes can be &s;upported only by the few who po&s;&s;e&s;s very hardened con&s;titutions. The gradual changes of the &s;ea&s;ons prepare us in the &s;afe&s;t manner to &s;u&s;tain all the alternations of cold and hot weather. It is therefore an error, and of no &s;mall con&s;equence, in the modern &s;y&s;tem of education, that we generally endeavour to habituate our children to the &s;upport of cold weather only. Per&s;ons who cannot bear the heat of the &s;un, or &s;trongly heated rooms, are,
<PB N="176" REF="039111_0206_1013A043D77BFA68">
from their exce&s;&s;ive delicacy, frequently ex|po&s;ed to the mo&s;t violent, nay to mortal acci|dents. Hence children ought to be &s;lowly and gradually accu&s;tomed to the&s;e inconve|niencies, which indeed occur frequently, and are more dangerous than tho&s;e ari&s;ing from &s;udden tran&s;itions to a colder temperature: for the effects of the latter may, in a great mea&s;ure, be obviated by exerci&s;e and mu&s;cu|lar action.</P>
<P>In the &s;ultry days of &s;ummer, we &s;hould be particularly on our guard again&s;t violently overheating the body;&mdash;in autumn, we &s;hould not dre&s;s too lightly, and in the mornings and evenings always &s;omewhat warmer;&mdash;in &s;hort, we ought to avoid every thing that appears likely to check and repel per&s;piration. The baneful cu&s;tom of accommodating our dre&s;s to the almanack and the fa&s;hion, rather than to the vici&s;&s;itudes of the weather, in this incon&s;tant climate, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be pro|ductive of many di&s;agreeable con&s;equences. Above all things, we ought to change our &s;ummer-dre&s;s pretty early in autumn, and to clothe our&s;elves gradually warmer, according to the variations of the weather. Yet after all, perhaps it would be mo&s;t advi&s;able to ac|cu&s;tom our&s;elves to one kind of dre&s;s only for all &s;ea&s;ons. The propriety of this cu&s;tom I &s;hall more particularly con&s;ider in the fourth Chapter.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the proper time for heat|ing rooms in autumn, it has been &s;uppo&s;ed, that early fires are unwhole&s;ome and produc|tive of frequent catarrhs. This a&s;&s;ertion is
<PB N="177" REF="039111_0207_1013A000F8A724B0">
certainly ill founded; for in warming a room, as well as in clothing the body, we &s;hould not &s;o much be regulated by the particular time of the year, as the &s;tate of the weather, and the degrees of actual heat and cold: in at|tending to this circum&s;tance, we cannot ea&s;ily mi&s;take. If, in the temperate days of autumn, the room &s;hould feel colder than the external air, it is time to make a moderate fire: in damp and cold weather this is an u&s;eful pre|caution, even in &s;ummer. Tho&s;e who from caprice, par&s;imony, or prejudice, would rather &s;hiver on &s;ome weeks longer, than con&s;ult their &s;en&s;ations, often feel the con&s;equence of a violent cold. The Dutch and German &s;toves certainly afford more uniform heat in a room, though they might not be con&s;idered cheerful enough for an Engli&s;h company.</P>
<P>As we can neither breathe nor live without fre&s;h air, we ought not to withdraw our bod|ies too much from the bracing effects of cold. In this re&s;pect, we &s;hould act conformably to nature, that is, in the &s;ame degree as the warmer weather changes to a colder &s;tate, we &s;hould gradually expo&s;e our&s;elves to the various changes of temperature. The cold will then neither feel unplea&s;ant, nor impede the nece&s;&s;ary per&s;piration; e&s;pecially if we oppo&s;e it with vigour and bodily exerci&s;e. We ought al&s;o to take more &s;olid &s;u&s;tenance in winter than in &s;ummer; becau&s;e, by the longer continued motion or dige&s;tive proce&s;s of the &s;tomach, the circulation of the blood is accelerated, from which the natural heat of the body is produced. Nature her&s;elf dictates
<PB N="178" REF="039111_0208_1013A0455D9CF2A8">
a compliance with this precept, as &s;he has pro|vided us with more &s;ub&s;tantial articles of food during the former &s;ea&s;on than the latter.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, as every &s;udden change of the weath|er from heat to cold, and the rever&s;e, is preju|dicial to the body, we ought to guard again&s;t every circum&s;tance by which <HI>per&s;piration</HI> may be &s;uddenly checked. Hence we never &s;hould remove from a &s;trongly heated apartment in|to a fre&s;h and cold air, unle&s;s we are provided with a warmer dre&s;s;&mdash;in hot days, or after violent exerci&s;e, we &s;hould not frequent vaults, cellars, or ice-hou&s;es, undre&s;s immediately af|ter overheating the body, nor take re&s;t upon a damp &s;oil or upon &s;tones, nor bathe in cold water. Such tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions have often been puni&s;hed with in&s;tant death, or, what is &s;till wor&s;e, have brought on a painful and linger|ing &s;pecies of con&s;umption, which has hither|to baffled the united efforts of the Faculty, and which annually makes dreadful havoc among people of a middle age.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">According to the &s;tatement given by the Bills of Mortality, the total number of deaths in London, during the three &s;pring months of 1799, amounted to 5271. Among the&s;e, no le&s;s than 1353, or <HI>upwards of one fourth,</HI> were carried off by <HI>con&s;umption!</HI>&mdash;Although con&s;umption and <HI>decline</HI> are terms often u&s;ed to expre&s;s many other <HI>chronic</HI> di&s;ea&s;es, as well as <HI>pulmonary con&s;umption,</HI> &s;o that the above &s;tated number probably includes various &s;pecies of decline, yet, even with the&s;e allowances, the number of victims to <HI>general con&s;umption</HI> is truly terrific.

<HEAD>Of Cleanline&s;s in general.</HEAD>
<P>THIS dome&s;tic virtue ought to extend its influence to every object connected with the human frame; to the preparation and con&s;umption of food and drink; to dre&s;s, habitation, hou&s;ehold furniture, and all our phy&s;ical wants; in a word, cleanline&s;s &s;hould not be confined merely to the interior do|me&s;tic economy; it claims our attention in every place which we occupy, and wherein we breathe.</P>
<P>Let our clothes, linen, beds, covers, blank|ets and &s;heets, be clean and dry; as all the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances ab&s;orb per&s;pirable matter, and check the proce&s;s of per&s;piration. Articles of dre&s;s which are &s;oiled, and come into contact with the &s;kin, being placed immediately over the pores, reimbibe the humours already per|&s;pired, and return them to the body by the ab&s;orbents. Dirty linen will never attract the u&s;ele&s;s or noxious matter, which is &s;ecreted from the blood, and ejected from the body; it remains on the pores of the &s;kin, and is ei|ther again ab&s;orbed by the ve&s;&s;els, or clogs tho&s;e emunctories which require always to be kept open. For a &s;imilar rea&s;on, it is highly
<PB N="181" REF="039111_0211_1013A0082BB44738">
improper and dangerous to wear the clothes of &s;ick per&s;ons, e&s;pecially in contagious di&s;|tempers.</P>
<P>Let the body, and particularly the joints, be frequently wa&s;hed with pure water, e&s;pe|cially in &s;ummer, when the per&s;pirable mat|ter, being of an unctuous, clammy nature, ob&s;tructs the excretion by the pores. The face, neck and hands, being mo&s;t expo&s;ed to the air, du&s;t, and the like, ought to be daily wa&s;hed, both morning and evening. Atten|tion &s;hould al&s;o be paid to the ears, by clean|ing them occa&s;ionally; &s;o that the &s;en&s;e of hearing may not be impaired by an accumu|lation of wax, which from its acrid nature may prove unplea&s;ant as well as injurious. The whole head ought to be frequently wa&s;h|ed and cleaned, even though no hair-powder be u&s;ed; as it per&s;pires very much, and is be|&s;ides expo&s;ed to du&s;t and other particles in the atmo&s;phere. Wa&s;hing opens the pores, while the comb, by its clo&s;e application to the &s;kin, di&s;&s;olves the vi&s;cid humours, and ren|ders them fluid.</P>
<P>The mouth &s;hould be rin&s;ed every morn|ing, after dinner, and at night, with cold wa|ter, but in winter the chill &s;hould be taken off. The frequent wa&s;hing of the mouth is otherwi&s;e nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e the vi&s;cid &s;lime, and &s;mall particles of food which &s;ettle about the inter&s;tices of the teeth, are very apt to putrify, and, if not removed, will infect the breath, and gradually injure the teeth them|&s;elves. Be&s;ides, this &s;lime &s;ettles on the tongue,

covers the papillae by which food is ta&s;ted, and renders the palate le&s;s &s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>It is &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that the no&s;e al&s;o &s;hould not be overlooked, as by neg|lecting to remove the &s;ecreted moi&s;ture in due time, the effects may become trouble&s;ome and detrimental to the organs of &s;mell. In chil|dren, the no&s;e ought to be occa&s;ionally wa&s;h|ed; it having been found that the unplea&s;ant &s;mell, peculiar to &s;ome infants, is owing to the habitual neglect of cleaning that organ.</P>
<P>The tongue &s;hould be cleaned every morn|ing, either with a &s;mall piece of whalebone, or with a &s;age leaf. This leaf is likewi&s;e u&s;e|ful for poli&s;hing the teeth. To clean the throat, we &s;hould gargle it with fre&s;h water, and &s;wallow a mouthful of water every morn|ing&mdash;the latter, however, mu&s;t not be at|tempted too ha&s;tily&punc; but, when we once ac|cu&s;tom our&s;elves to the practice, we &s;hall find it attended with advantage.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary, particularly in hot weather, to wa&s;h the feet frequently; as they per&s;pire much, and are more expo&s;ed to du&s;t than any other part of the body. The water &s;hould be warm, but not too much &s;o, becau&s;e hot water thus u&s;ed relaxes the fibres, drives the blood upwards, and occa&s;ions head-achs.

<HEAD>On the management of the Teeth.</HEAD>
<P>THE principal requi&s;ite for the pre&s;ervation of the teeth is, never to retire to re&s;t without having cleaned them: for this prevents the vi&s;cous matter of food, collected during the day, from corrupting them in the night. The tooth-ach, now &s;o common, is frequently ow|ing to a hollow &s;tate of the teeth, but &s;till more frequently originates in a want of clean|line&s;s.
<PB N="184" REF="039111_0214_1013A04C0AE62940">
The cleaning of the teeth, however, requires precaution. What is called the Tar|tar of the Teeth, is of a corro&s;ive nature, and &s;hould be removed with the greate&s;t care. The manner in which mo&s;t Denti&s;ts treat the teeth, as well as their powders, tinctures, and other dentifrices, although highly puffed off and &s;trongly recommended, are obviou&s;ly pernicious. They deprive the teeth of their enamel, make them loo&s;e, and &s;poil the gums. The various dentifrices, whether <HI>Royal</HI> or <HI>Im|perial,</HI> adverti&s;ed in the public papers, are at lea&s;t of doubtful, if not injurious effect. It is an a&s;toni&s;hing in&s;tance of credulity and infat|uation, that people will take external and in|ternal <HI>medicines upon tru&s;t,</HI> when they would he&s;itate to take any <HI>food,</HI> with which they are unacquainted.</P>
<P>If there be too much tartar, &s;o that it ad|heres like a cement between two teeth, its be|ing incautiou&s;ly removed will deprive the teeth of the tartarous cohe&s;ion, and con&s;e|quently of their &s;upport; thus, from the con&s;tant contact of the tongue, lips and food, they will be &s;haken and loo&s;ened. The &s;ame will happen, &s;hould the tartar be allowed to eat away the gum from the root of the tooth. If in this ca&s;e the foundation of the tooth be injured, it will nece&s;&s;arily be rendered loo&s;e, the gums being no longer able to retain a tooth, which is deprived of its intermedi|ate cement.</P>
<P>The tartar therefore mu&s;t not be broken, all at once, with iron or gla&s;s in&s;truments; but may be gradually &s;craped away with a
<PB N="185" REF="039111_0215_1013A00B36A5F998">
blunt or broad cut quill, or &s;ome &s;imilar &s;ub|&s;tance, from which the enamel of the teeth can &s;uffer no injury. Mo&s;t kinds of di&s;&s;olvent drops, e&s;pecially tho&s;e &s;old as &s;pecifics for whitening the teeth, are made up of vitriolic acid, diluted with &s;ome di&s;tilled waters&mdash;They are of no &s;ervice, but, on the contrary, remove the enamel with the tartar, and thus &s;poil the teeth for ever. The common tooth-bru&s;hes are liable to the &s;ame objection.</P>
<P>To prevent the tartar from &s;ettling on the teeth, they ought to be kept clean, by wa&s;h|ing them every morning and evening. Cer|tain articles of food and drink &s;hould likewi&s;e be mentioned, as having a tendency to pro|duce and accumulate the tartar&mdash;&s;uch are all vi&s;cous and &s;aline &s;ub&s;tances, as &s;alted and &s;moked meat, chee&s;e, roa&s;ted eggs, the fle&s;h of tame and wild animals kept too long for the &s;ake of making it more tender and pala|table, truffles, and all &s;pecies of mu&s;hrooms; beans, peas, che&s;nuts, vinegar, tart wines, and all kinds of acid fruit.</P>
<P>An expedient equally &s;afe and effectual, for removing the tartar, is, to cover the teeth with a fine powder of <HI>Gum Tragacanth,</HI> or with &s;oft wax, and by that means to extract the tartar at once, together with this adhe|&s;ive covering.</P>
<P>Although it does not enter into the plan of the&s;e Lectures to treat of the various di&s;ea&s;es to which the teeth are &s;ubject, or to de&s;cribe the different methods pur&s;ued in curing them, yet I judge it nece&s;&s;ary to point out &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;imple and approved remedies in that
<PB N="186" REF="039111_0216_1013A050F26FE550">
very painful affection, the tooth-ach. If the complaint proceed from a hollow and carious tooth, &s;ome &s;oft extract of the Peruvian Bark may be placed in the cavity of the tooth; if this &s;hould not remove the pain, a few drops of <HI>Cajeput oil</HI> upon cotton may be applied to the hollow tooth, or rubbed externally upon the painful &s;ide of the cheek. THUNBERG, the Swedi&s;h Traveller, introduced the u&s;e of Cajeput oil into Europe, having often wit|ne&s;&s;ed its powerful and almo&s;t in&s;tantaneous effects in the Ea&s;t Indies, where it is the la&s;t and only comfort of gouty and rheumatic &s;ufferers.</P>
<P><HI>Dr. Richter,</HI> an eminent Phy&s;ician of G&ouml;t|tingen, informs us that he has frequently re|lieved the mo&s;t violent tooth-ach, by applying externally the e&s;&s;ence of <HI>pimpinella,</HI> or Burnet-&s;axifrage, with an equal quantity of lauda|num, adding to it a drop or two of the e&s;&s;en|tial oil of cloves. Though external remedies are not likely to effect a radical cure of this malady, yet in urgent ca&s;es they may be &s;afe|ly re&s;orted to, e&s;pecially if applied &s;o as not to injure the &s;kin of the face; for they will often produce a temporary relief. If, how|ever, the tooth-ach proceed from <HI>no local</HI> cau&s;e; if, for in&s;tance, it be owing to a corrupted &s;tomach, to catarrhal, rheumatic, hy&s;teric, venereal, or other affections; all the &s;pecifics ever di&s;covered cannot remove the pain, until the cau&s;e al&s;o be, wholly or in part, removed. In my own practice, I have found the oil of Savin, or Juniper oil, preferable to laudanum, in its effects on a hollow tooth; the latter is at be&s;t an uncertain remedy.</P>

In &s;corbutic affections of the teeth and gums, a vegetable diet, con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of ripe fruit, and mucilaginous vegetables, will be found the be&s;t corrective. Be&s;ide the&s;e, a fine powder, made of three parts of double-re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ined &s;ugar, and one part of burnt alum, may be employed with advantage for the pur|po&s;e of rubbing them. Sugar is an excellent anti&s;eptic; and IMBERT DE LONNES, a French Phy&s;ician, reports, that a whole &s;hip's com|pany was once cured of an alarming &s;curvy, by living for &s;ome time, from nece&s;&s;ity, upon &s;ugar alone. We &s;hould al&s;o con&s;ider the connexion &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the teeth and the &s;tomach; if the former be unequal to the purpo&s;es of ma&s;tication, the dige&s;tive powers will be gradually impaired, and the &s;ounde&s;t &s;tomach corrupted. To neglect the teeth, therefore, is to neglect the &s;tomach; and if the &s;tomach be weakened, the whole ma&s;s of the fluids, and particularly the blood, will ul|timately be tainted with crude, una&s;&s;imilated, and acrimonious humours.</P>
<P>To di&s;&s;olve and wa&s;h away the &s;uperfluous, &s;limy, and unctuous matters which produce the tartar, fre&s;h water is &s;ufficient; or it may be rendered a little more acrid by the admix|ture of a &s;mall quantity of common &s;alt. Acids and alkalies, &s;o frequently employed as dentifrices, are of too corro&s;ive a nature; and alkalies in particular injure the gums, perhaps the teeth them&s;elves, while acids deprive them of their enamel, and thus occa&s;ion a &s;peedy external corruption and inevitable gangrene within.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="039111_0218_1013A053954A7C38">
The mo&s;t &s;imple dentifrice is a cru&s;t of bread hard toa&s;ted, and reduced to a fine powder. This is fully calculated to ab&s;orb the vi&s;cid, oleaginous particles, and to remove the &s;tony or tartarous matter. The bread, how|ever, &s;hould not be toa&s;ted too black, as in that ca&s;e it would evolve an acrid alkaline &s;alt, which might prove hurtful. A &s;till better dentifrice is a moderately fine powder of the Peruvian Bark, particularly of the genuine red &s;pecies, which &s;trengthens the gums, without inflaming them.</P>
<P>In cleaning the teeth we ought not to make u&s;e of bru&s;hes or &s;ponges, but of the finger, which being provided with the fine&s;t papillary ve&s;&s;els, is a much better and more proper in|&s;trument, and precludes the nece&s;&s;ity of re|&s;orting to artificial means. Be&s;ides, the fin|ger has the advantage of being &s;oft and plia|ble, and of feeling any immoderate pre&s;&s;ure too &s;en&s;ibly, to permit us to do injury to the teeth or gums:&mdash;hence, it is an ill-judged delicacy alone which can prevent us from making u&s;e of it, preferably to even the be&s;t tooth-bru&s;hes.</P>
<P>For cleaning the inter&s;tices between the teeth, we &s;hould not employ pins or needles, whether made of gold, &s;ilver, or &s;teel; for all metallic &s;ub&s;tances are apt to canker the teeth. If toothpicks be at all advi&s;able, they &s;hould be made of &s;oft wood, or quills cut in a blunt point. In my own opinion, none &s;hould be u&s;ed; for, of whatever materials they are made, they open, loo&s;en, and injure the teeth, by making room for the tartar and
<PB N="189" REF="039111_0219_1013A010A99700D0">
other matters, to prey upon the teeth and gums. To an&s;wer every purpo&s;e of tooth|picks, a thick and &s;oft cotton cloth &s;hould be u&s;ed, to rub the teeth over gently after eve|ry meal: but if people have once accu&s;tomed them&s;elves to regularly picking their teeth, then indeed the cotton frictions may perhaps be too late.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, the cleaning and bru&s;hing of the teeth, however u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary, is in&s;uf|ficient to prevent the &s;ettling of the tartar, and the con&s;equent injury to the teeth; for the &s;ource of both evils does not exi&s;t in the mouth, but really proceeds from the &s;tomach, and a corrupted &s;tate of the fluids. For this rea&s;on, the medical treatment of the teeth re|quires a particular regimen and diet, accord|ing to the individual ca&s;e of every patient.</P>

<HEAD>Of the U&s;e of Baths.</HEAD>
<P>THIS important branch of dietetic regimen is of excellent u&s;e and efficacy, both in the cure and prevention of di&s;ea&s;es. Though the ancients could le&s;s di&s;pen&s;e with the u&s;e of the bath, on account of the frequently of their athletic exerci&s;es, as well as from the want of linen, which was then much le&s;s in u&s;e than at pre&s;ent, yet in our times it would be of great &s;ervice, if the u&s;e of baths were more general and frequent, and this beneficial practice not confined to particular places or &s;ea&s;ons, as a mere matter of fa&s;hion. Con|&s;idered
<PB N="190" REF="039111_0220_1013A0552F160420">
as a &s;pecies of univer&s;al dome&s;tic rem|edy, as one which forms the ba&s;is of cleanli|ne&s;s, bathing, in its different forms, may be pronounced one of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive and beneficial re&s;torers of health and vigour. I am not &s;o &s;anguine, however, in my expecta|tions, as to think that the cure of all mala|dies and di&s;ea&s;es may be effected by the bath, as was lately promi&s;ed by a noted empiric in this country, who mo&s;t &s;agaciou&s;ly impreg|nated his vapour baths with the collective produce of the vegetable kingdom. Such a general remedy is ju&s;t as chimerical as the mo&s;t famous panaceas, the tincture of gold not excepted.</P>
<P>Bathing, whether in warm or cold water, produces the mo&s;t &s;alutary effect on the ab|&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els; which would otherwi&s;e re|conduct the impurities of the &s;kin through the pores, to the no &s;mall injury of health. To tho&s;e in a perfect &s;tate of vigour, the fre|quent u&s;e of the bath is le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary than to the infirm; as the healthy po&s;&s;e&s;s a greater power to re&s;i&s;t impurities, by means of their unimpaired per&s;piration, the ela&s;ticity of their minute ve&s;&s;els, and the due con&s;i&s;tence of their circulating fluids. The ca&s;e is very dif|ferent with the infirm, the delicate, and the aged. In the&s;e, the &s;lowne&s;s of circulation, the vi&s;cidity or clammine&s;s of the fluids, the con&s;tant efforts of nature to propel the im|purities towards the &s;kin, combine to render the frequent wa&s;hing of their bodies an e&s;&s;en|tial requi&s;ite to their phy&s;ical exi&s;tence.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="039111_0221_1013A0133B46AAD8">
Baths, con&s;idered as the means of curing di&s;ea&s;es and re&s;toring health, if judiciou&s;ly applied, are likewi&s;e of peculiar advantage; and though, in this re&s;pect, they do not prop|erly make part of a regular &s;y&s;tem of dietetics, yet I &s;hall reque&s;t the indulgence of the read|er, while I make a few nece&s;&s;ary remarks rel|ative to the proper application of the bath, it being &s;o frequently u&s;ed as a mere dietetic remedy. Much depends on a clear and ac|curate knowledge of the properties and effects of the different baths. I &s;hall therefore di|vide them into two principal cla&s;&s;es, the <HI>warm</HI> and the <HI>cold</HI> bath.</P>
<P>The <HI>warm,</HI> that is, the tepid or lukewarm bath, being about the temperature of the blood, between 96 and 98&deg; of Fahrenheit, has u&s;ually been con&s;idered as apt to weaken and relax the body; but this is certainly an ill-founded notion. It is only when its heat exceeds that of the human body (as in the <HI>Hot Bath</HI> and <HI>King's Bath</HI> at BATH, both of which are from 18 to 20 degrees higher than blood-heat) that the warm bath <HI>can</HI> produce a debilitating effect. Indeed, baths of the above immoderate heat ought not to be u&s;ed in their natural &s;tate, that is, without redu|cing their temperature by cold water, except in particular ca&s;es, and under the immediate advice of a phy&s;ician. On the contrary, the lukewarm or tepid bath, from 96 downwards to 85, is always &s;afe; and is &s;o far from re|laxing the tone of the &s;olids, that it may ju&s;t|ly be con&s;idered as one of the mo&s;t powerful and univer&s;al re&s;toratives with which we are
<PB N="192" REF="039111_0222_1013A057D0197D90">
acquainted. In&s;tead of heating the body, it has a cooling effect; it dimini&s;hes the quick|ne&s;s of the pul&s;e, and reduces it in a greater proportion, according as the pul&s;e has been more quick and unnatural, and according to the length of time the bath is continued. Hence tepid baths are of eminent &s;ervice, where the body has been over-heated, from whatever cau&s;e, whether after fatigue from travelling, or &s;evere bodily exerci&s;e, or after violent exertion and perturbation of mind; as they allay the tempe&s;tuous and irregular movements of the body, and con&s;equently, in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e, invigorate the &s;y&s;tem. By their &s;oftening, moi&s;tening, and tumify|ing power, they greatly contribute to the formation and growth of the body of young per&s;ons, and are of &s;ingular benefit to tho&s;e, in whom we perceive a tendency to arrive too early at the con&s;i&s;tence of a &s;ettled age; &s;o that the warm bath is particularly adapted to prolong the &s;tate of youth, and retard for &s;ome time the approach of full manhood. This effect the tepid baths produce in a man|ner exactly alike, in the colde&s;t as well as in the hotte&s;t climates.</P>
<P>From what has been advanced, it will not be difficult to di&s;cover, in what particular di&s;|orders the tepid bath may be of the greate&s;t &s;ervice, and the rea&s;on why they prove &s;o eminently u&s;eful (particularly in a parched and rough &s;tate of the &s;kin) in paralytic, &s;pa&s;|modic, bilious, con&s;umptive, hypochondriac, hy&s;teric, and in&s;ane ca&s;es, as well as in an ac|rimonious and corrupted &s;tate of the fluids,
<PB N="193" REF="039111_0223_1013A014C65761F0">
&s;uch as &s;corbutic and leprous eruptions, lues, &amp;c. One obvious effect of the habitual u&s;e of the bath, particularly the tepid, is, that it &s;oft|ens and renews the external integuments of the body. It con&s;iderably increa&s;es the pre&s;&s;ure on the body from without; hence breathing, particularly on entering the bath, is frequent|ly &s;omewhat difficult, until the mu&s;cles have by practice become inured to a greater degree of re&s;i&s;tance. Yet this effect, which in mo&s;t in&s;tances is of &s;mall importance, requires the greate&s;t precaution in &s;ome particular ca&s;es, &s;o far as to prevent the u&s;e of the bath alto|gether; for in&s;tance, in per&s;ons of a full hab|it, who are in danger of breaking &s;ome of the internal blood-ve&s;&s;els, by the precipitate u&s;e of the bath, whether warm or cold.</P>
<P>The&s;e few hints will be &s;ufficient to deter|mine the ca&s;es, in which the lukewarm bath may be re&s;orted to with &s;afety and advan|tage, as a <HI>dietetical</HI> remedy. Its application in the treatment of di&s;ea&s;es is foreign to the object of this Chapter, and demands the mo&s;t minute inquiry into the nature of the ca&s;es which indicate the u&s;e of it, as it is of it&s;elf a potent remedy, which, if improperly u&s;ed, may produce a contrary effect.</P>
<P>Bathing in rivers, as well as in the &s;ea, is effectual for every purpo&s;e of cleaning the body; it wa&s;hes away impurities from the &s;urface, opens the cutaneous ve&s;&s;els for a due per&s;piration, and increa&s;es the activity of the circulation of the blood. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, it cannot be too much recommended, not only to the infirm and debilitated, under cer|tain
<PB N="194" REF="039111_0224_1013A05B76262308">
re&s;trictions, but likewi&s;e to the healthy. The apprehen&s;ion of bad con&s;equences from the coldne&s;s of the water, is in reality ill-founded; for, be&s;ides that it produces a &s;trengthening effect, by its a&s;tringent property, the cold &s;en&s;ation is not of it&s;elf hurtful.</P>
<P>The &s;ame precaution, however, is requi&s;ite in the u&s;e of the cold as that of the tepid bath; for after having overheated the body, e&s;pecially in the hot days of &s;ummer, it may prove in&s;tantly fatal, by inducing a &s;tate of apoplexy. Hence the plethoric, the a&s;thmatic, and all tho&s;e who perceive a great determina|tion of the blood to the head, &s;hould be very circum&s;pect in its u&s;e. For although the con|&s;equence may not prove immediately fatal, yet the too great &s;train and pre&s;&s;ure may ea&s;ily bur&s;t &s;ome of the &s;maller blood-ve&s;&s;els in the head or brea&s;t, and thereby lay the foundation of an incurable di&s;order. To &s;uch as are of a &s;ound and robu&s;t con&s;titution, bathing may be rendered an agreeable exerci&s;e, by &s;wim|ming again&s;t the &s;tream; for, the fibres and ve&s;&s;els being obliged to re&s;i&s;t the power of the undulating waves, the nerves are thereby ex|cited into action.</P>
<P>Before I proceed to lay down dietetical rules for the u&s;e of the bath, I &s;hall premi&s;e a brief hi&s;torical narrative of this excellent prac|tice, and generally explain its &s;en&s;ible effects.</P>
<P>Among the Greeks, and particularly the Spartans, bathing was not intru&s;ted to the ca|price of individuals, but con&s;idered as a pub|lic in&s;titution, being governed and arranged agreeably to the expre&s;s laws of the State. We
<PB N="195" REF="039111_0225_1013A01874FE0A40">
learn al&s;o from Sacred Hi&s;tory, that among the Jews, at a much earlier period, per&s;ons under certain circum&s;tances were pronounced unclean, and con&s;equently unfit to hold any intercour&s;e or communion with others, until they had performed the appointed ablutions. The Greeks, according to their own hi&s;tori|ans, learnt this practice from the Egyptians, and the Romans from the Greeks. With tho&s;e celebrated nations, public and private baths formed an important branch of u&s;eful and ornamental architecture. Many opulent individuals courted the favour of the people by lavi&s;hing their trea&s;ures in the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment and decoration of public baths; and to this day we frequently di&s;cover the valuable remains of the&s;e national edifices. Among the Romans, the baths were in time convert|ed into regular and luxurious dwelling-places, in which the &s;ons of the patricians and of the wealthy were educated; a circum&s;tance &s;uffi|ciently a&s;certained in the hi&s;tory of CHARLES the Great.</P>
<P>The changes which the contact of cold wa|ter produces on the body, naturally lead us to inquire into the phy&s;ical nature and properties of the cold bath. The lighte&s;t water is at lea&s;t 800 times heavier than air; from which it has been concluded, that the former pre&s;&s;es upon the human body with a force propor|tionally great. If, therefore, the column of air, which pre&s;&s;es upon our body with a force equal to 39,900lb. could be converted into water, the whole weight of that pre&s;&s;ure would amount to 31,920,000lb. Yet, as our health
<PB N="196" REF="039111_0226_1013A05D00DB8F08">
is affected by a difference in the pre&s;&s;ure of the air, occa&s;ionally varying from 3 to 4000lb. we may ea&s;ily under&s;tand, that the human body is not calculated to &s;u&s;tain, for any length of time, the great pre&s;&s;ure of water. From this cau&s;e, the mo&s;t experienced negro divers dare not venture beyond a certain depth of the &s;ea; well knowing it would be impo&s;&s;ible to ri&s;e up again&s;t the additional weight of wa|ter incumbent upon their bodies.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;ible <HI>properties</HI> of the <HI>Cold Bath,</HI> in general, con&s;i&s;t in its power of contracting the &s;olid parts, and of in&s;pi&s;&s;ating the fluids. Any part of the body, which is expo&s;ed to the &s;udden contact of cold water, experiences at the &s;ame in&s;tant a degree of ten&s;ion and contraction, and becomes narrow and &s;maller. Not only the blood-ve&s;&s;els, but likewi&s;e the &s;mall capillary tubes, are liable to this con|traction and &s;ub&s;equent relaxation. What is vulgarly called <HI>goo&s;e-&s;kin</HI> is an effort of the cu|taneous fibres, a contraction of the orifices of the ab&s;orbent and exhalant ve&s;&s;els, occa&s;ioned by mental perturbation, &s;pa&s;ms, or the effect of cold.&mdash;Hence it happens, that by the cold bath all the blood-ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin, and of the mu&s;cles in immediate contact with it, are &s;o con&s;tricted and dimini&s;hed, that at the time of this violent exertion they are unable to re|ceive the u&s;ual quantity of blood. The &s;mall|er ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin are likewi&s;e clo&s;ed, and pre&s;s upon the humours contained in them, &s;o as to prevent all per&s;piration during this pre&s;&s;ure. Thus all the fibres of the &s;kin and mu&s;cles are brought into clo&s;e contact; and
<PB N="197" REF="039111_0227_1013A01C1A240828">
if the humours contained in the&s;e tubes had no other outlets, by which to di&s;charge them|&s;elves, they would become thick or in&s;pi&s;&s;a|ted, and lo&s;e their natural warmth. Were this in&s;pi&s;&s;ation of the fluids really to take place, it would be attended with dangerous &s;tagnations and ob&s;tructions. That it does not, however, produce the&s;e fatal effects, may be a&s;cribed to the following cau&s;e. As &s;oon as the pre&s;&s;ure is made again&s;t the external ve&s;&s;els, the blood retreats from them, in &s;earch of places where it may find le&s;s re&s;i&s;tance. All the great ve&s;&s;els within the body afford receptacles, into which it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> flows, till the principal arteries, and the veins of the inte&s;|tines, being filled, extended, and enlarged, it ri&s;es to the heart. Although the effect con|&s;equent on the cold bath may be con&s;idered as altogether mechanical, yet this &s;imple ope|ration is frequently productive of the mo&s;t important and beneficial effects.</P>
<P>All other &s;trengthening remedies, opera|ting, in general, only on the fluid parts of the body, require to be previou&s;ly di&s;&s;olved by the fluids, blended with the ma&s;s of blood, and thereby conducted to the &s;olid parts. The cold bath, on the contrary, acts almo&s;t in&s;tan|taneou&s;ly on the &s;olid parts them&s;elves, and produces its bracing effect, before a &s;ingle drop of blood has been commuted. From which remedy, therefore, is it mo&s;t likely we &s;hould derive the de&s;ired effect, that which imme|diately an&s;wers the purpo&s;e, or that which mu&s;t pa&s;s through &s;o many canals, and under|go &s;o many changes, before it arrives at the
<PB N="198" REF="039111_0228_1013A05FAB974D40">
place where it is to exert its efficacy? The &s;udden changes ari&s;ing from the application of the cold bath contribute in various ways to brace the human body. The relaxed fibres of the &s;kin and the mu&s;cles acquire more &s;olidi|ty and compactne&s;s from contraction. Their ela&s;ticity is increa&s;ed, and thus a con&s;iderable defect removed: the nerves are &s;timulated and incited to tho&s;e powerful exertions, on which the ea&s;e, vigour, and habitual &s;pright|line&s;s of the body &s;o much depend. From that degree of irritability which the nerves po&s;&s;e&s;s, when in a debilitated &s;tate, ari&s;e all hy&s;teric, &s;pa&s;modic, and convul&s;ive &s;ymptoms and affections. The&s;e may be mitigated or removed by the cold bath; becau&s;e it greatly affects and alters the &s;tate of the nerves; it &s;hakes and animates them, and by its forcible operation overcomes their tendency to preter|natural rigidity and other di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;a|tions. Here then we have two cau&s;es, which illu&s;trate the excellent effects of this remedy: there remains, however, a third, more im|portant and powerful, yet to be explained.</P>
<P>The blood, which by external pre&s;&s;ure is driven into the internal ve&s;&s;els, extends and enlarges them, without dimini&s;hing that con|tractile force or tendency which is peculiar to every artery. At the moment when the ex|ternal pre&s;&s;ure cea&s;es, all the internal ve&s;&s;els exert their powers of &s;elf-contraction more forcibly than u&s;ual, as they are more &s;trongly extended, and con&s;equently enabled to exer|ci&s;e a greater force. The blood returned to the cutaneous and mu&s;cular ve&s;&s;els, finds its

re&s;ervoirs contracted and invigorated; it flows through mu&s;cles, the fibres of which have acquired greater ela&s;ticity and power of re&s;i&s;tance. It is accelerated in its new motion by the&s;e improved fibres and veins, and the re&s;ult of the collective powers is a fre&s;h im|pul&s;e and rapidity given to its circulation. Although, at the fir&s;t immer&s;ion, the uniform cour&s;e of it is &s;omewhat interrupted, this tem|porary &s;toppage &s;erves afterwards to re-e&s;tab|li&s;h and promote it. The blood can now penetrate with ea&s;e into the &s;malle&s;t capillary ve&s;&s;els; and it can circulate freely through every part of the animal machine, without affecting or relaxing the &s;olids.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Such are the advantages which the theory of bathing holds out. I &s;hall, however, quote a re&s;pectable authority, which may be of u&s;e to remove &s;ome erroneous notions hitherto very prevalent, in the practice of cold bathing.</P>
<P>"In the earlier &s;tages of exerci&s;e, (&s;ays Dr. CURRIE, of <HI>Liverpool,</HI>) before profu&s;e per&s;piration has di&s;&s;ipated the heat, and fatigue debil|itated the living power, nothing is more &s;afe, according to my expe|rience, than the cold bath. This is &s;o true, that I have for &s;ome years con&s;tantly directed infirm per&s;ons to u&s;e &s;uch a degree of exer|ci&s;e, before immer&s;ion, as may produce &s;ome increa&s;ed action of the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem, with &s;ome increa&s;e of heat, and thus &s;ecure a force of reaction under the &s;hock, which otherwi&s;e might not always take place. The popular opinion, that it is &s;afe&s;t to go perfectly cool into the water, is founded on erroneous notions, and &s;ometimes pro|ductive of injurious con&s;equences. Thus per&s;ons heated and begin|ning to per&s;pire, often think it nece&s;&s;ary to wait on the edge of the bath, until they are perfectly cooled, and then plunging into the wa|ter, feel a &s;udden chilline&s;s that is alarming and dangerous. In &s;uch ca&s;es the injury is generally imputed to going into the water too warm, whereas in truth it ari&s;es from going in too cold.</P>
<P>"But though it be perfectly &s;afe to go into the cold bath in the earlier &s;tages of exerci&s;e, nothing is more dangerous than this prac|tice, after exerci&s;e has produced profu&s;e per&s;piration, and terminated in languor and fatigue; becau&s;e in &s;uch circum&s;tances the heat is not only &s;inking rapidly, but the &s;y&s;tem parts more ea&s;ily with the por|tion that remains.</P>

I once knew on in&s;tance of four young men, who, having worked at harve&s;t in the heat of the day, with a view of refre&s;hing them|&s;elves, plunged into a &s;pring of cold water; two died on the &s;pot, a third the next morning, and the fourth recovered with great difficulty.'</HI> The authority of the American Bacon is of great weight in Medicine, as in every branch of &s;cience, and particularly in what re&s;pects immer|&s;ion in water; for doubtle&s;s he &s;pent more time in this element, than any philo&s;opher of modern days.

Be&s;ides, the cold bath is alto|gether improper in a weak &s;tate of the lungs, in all complaints of the brea&s;t, in drop&s;ies, in plethoric habits, and for very corpulent indi|viduals; in all which ca&s;es the lukewarm bath may, if duly modifi|ed, produce effects highly beneficial.</P></NOTE></P>

The healthy and the vigorous, who re&s;ort to the cold bath, on account of its clean&s;ing and bracing effects, may continue in it, with &s;afe|ty, for a con&s;iderable time. But to &s;trengthen and to give ela&s;ticity to the &s;olid parts, every thing depends upon the &s;udden impre&s;&s;ion of the cold. This primary effect will be weak|ened or fru&s;trated by remaining in the bath till the water feels warm, whereby the pre&s;|&s;ing or vibrating action on the nerves at length cea&s;es.

remedy;&mdash;its effects are not &s;o much calcu|lated for the healthy and robu&s;t, as for the in|firm and di&s;ea&s;ed, under peculiar circum&s;tan|ces. The external u&s;e of cold water is of &s;in|gular benefit, when applied to particular parts of the body, where its u&s;e may be much long|er continued without danger, and where we may accompli&s;h the intended effects, in a man|ner, by compul&s;ion and per&s;everance.</P>
<P>Of all the parts of the body, the head re|ceives mo&s;t benefit from the affu&s;ion of cold water; this is a &s;imple and effectual remedy again&s;t too great an impul&s;e of the blood to|wards the head, where per&s;ons are threatened with apoplexy; in di&s;orders of the brain and cranium; in wounds and other complaints, to which the head is &s;ubject. In the&s;e in&s;tan|ces, its effects may be &s;till farther improved by frigorific or cooling &s;alts. The affu&s;ion of water upon the abdomen has likewi&s;e been employed with great advantage, in ca&s;es of ob&s;tinate co&s;tivene&s;s, affording almo&s;t in&s;tan|taneous relief, when internal remedies have produced no effect. This &s;hould not, how|ever, induce any per&s;on to try that remedy indi&s;criminately, or without proper advice.</P>
<P>On the contrary, in all tho&s;e ca&s;es where the cold bath might repel certain eruptive humours, which Nature determines towards the &s;urface of the body, it cannot be re&s;orted to without danger.

And yet the popular opinion &s;till prevalent, is, that there can be no
<PB N="202" REF="039111_0232_1013A0662816CD58">
better practice, than to plunge into the cold bath at all times, and in all &s;tates of the body, in order to &s;trengthen the nerves. Children, in particular, are indi&s;criminately accu&s;tomed to it from their infancy, to re&s;tore them to that degree of bodily vigour, for which our ance&s;tors were &s;o famed. That many chil|dren, by the daily practice of bathing them in cold water, grow and continue healthy and &s;trong, proves as little, as that many infants become vigorous and robu&s;t in the mo&s;t un|whole&s;ome climates, and under the mo&s;t un|favourable management.&mdash;Some think to for|tify the body, by the u&s;e of the cold bath, again&s;t the vici&s;&s;itudes of the weather; but it can be proved that children, who from their infancy have been bathed in cold water, are as much expo&s;ed to coughs and catarrhs, as tho&s;e who have not been habituated to this violent practice, provided they have not been mi&s;managed by effeminating indulgence. In general, all artificial plans of hardening and bracing the bodies of children, are commend|able only, when the child &s;hows no &s;trong and la&s;ting aver&s;ion to them.</P>
<P>It &s;hould be con&s;idered that, as the cold bath powerfully contracts the fibres by its frequent u&s;e, it imparts to the juvenile body an unnat|ural degree of &s;olidity and compactne&s;s, whereby it too early acquires the properties of an adult. The &s;kin of &s;uch children as have been too frequently bathed, is generally much drier and harder than it ought to be at their age. It is a remark of GALEN, that the cold bath does not agree with a growing per|&s;on,
<PB N="203" REF="039111_0233_1013A022E2862A50">
and he advi&s;es young people not to bathe at all till the body be completely formed. Is it not incon&s;i&s;tent, that by cold bathing we expect to bring the body of youth to the vig|our of age, and that afterwards, when age ap|proaches, we &s;hould wi&s;h to render it &s;ofter, and re&s;tore its energy, by lukewarm bathing? Hence the cold bath, for the purpo&s;e of &s;trengthening children, mu&s;t ever be con&s;id|ered as a doubtful remedy.</P>
<P>We now proceed to lay down &s;ome rules for the u&s;e of the cold bath, in the ca&s;es where it may be of &s;ervice. 1&s;t, Every cold bath applied to the whole body ought to be of &s;hort duration; all depends upon the fir&s;t impre&s;|&s;ion the cold makes on the &s;kin and nerves, it being this impre&s;&s;ion which hardens us again&s;t the effects of rough and cold weather:&mdash;2d, The head &s;hould be always fir&s;t wetted, either by immer&s;ion, or by pouring water up|on it, or the application of wet cloths, and then plunging over head into the bath:&mdash;3d, The immer&s;ion ought always to be &s;udden, not only becau&s;e it is le&s;s felt than when we enter the bath &s;lowly and timorou&s;ly, but likewi&s;e becau&s;e the effect of the fir&s;t impre&s;|&s;ion is uniform all over the body, and the blood in this manner is not driven from the lower to the upper parts. Hence the Shower Bath po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es great advantages, as it pours the water &s;uddenly upon the whole body, and thus in the mo&s;t perfect manner fulfils the three rules above &s;pecified:&mdash;4th, The due temperature of the cold bath can be a&s;certain|ed only in relation to individual ca&s;es: as it
<PB N="204" REF="039111_0234_1013A067AD42F1D0">
extends from 33 to 56&deg; of Fahrenheit, except in <HI>partial</HI> bathings, where, as has been already ob&s;erved, the degree of cold may, and often ought to be, increa&s;ed by ice, nitre, alum, &s;alt, &s;al ammoniac, or other artificial means:&mdash;5th, Gentle exerci&s;e ought to precede the cold bath, to produce &s;ome reaction of the va&s;cular &s;y&s;|tem in entering into it; for neither complete re&s;t nor violent exerci&s;e are proper, previous to the u&s;e of this remedy:&mdash;6th, The morn|ing or forenoon is the mo&s;t proper time for cold bathing, unle&s;s it be in a river,&mdash;then the afternoon, or towards the evening, when the water has been warmed by the &s;un, and the dinner has been dige&s;ted, are the mo&s;t eli|gible periods of the day. A light breakfa&s;t will not be detrimental before u&s;ing the bath:&mdash;7th, While in the water, we &s;hould not re|main inactive, but move about, in order to promote the circulation of the blood from the centre of the body to the extremities:&mdash;8th, After immer&s;ion, the whole body ought to be wiped, as quickly as po&s;&s;ible, with a dry and &s;omewhat rough cloth. Moderate exerci&s;e out of doors, if convenient, is proper, and in|deed nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>To &s;pecify the various &s;ituations, in which the cold bath may be u&s;ed with perfect &s;afety and advantage, would lead me too far, and does not belong, &s;trictly &s;peaking, to the &s;ub|ject of this book. I &s;hall, however, enumerate generally certain ca&s;es, in which we mu&s;t ab|&s;olutely refrain from the cold bath. 1. In a general plethora or full habit of body, and in the febrile di&s;po&s;ition which attends it; in he|morrhages
<PB N="205" REF="039111_0235_1013A02690D74398">
or fluxes of blood, and in every kind of inflammation. 2. In con&s;tipations or ob&s;tructions of the abdominal inte&s;tines. 3. In di&s;ea&s;es of the brea&s;t, difficult breathing, and &s;hort and dry coughs. 4. In an acrimo|nious &s;tate of the fluids, bad colour of the face, difficult healing of the fle&s;h, and the &s;curvy, properly &s;o called. 5. In gouty and rheumat|ic paroxy&s;ms. 6. In cutaneous di&s;ea&s;es. 7. In a &s;tate of pregnancy. And la&s;tly, 8. In a deformed or ill-&s;haped &s;tate of the body, ex|cept in &s;ome particular ca&s;es to be determined by a phy&s;ician.</P>
<P>The be&s;t method of cold bathing is in the &s;ea or a river. Where, from nece&s;&s;ity, it is done in the hou&s;e, I recommend the <HI>Shower Bath,</HI> for which a proper apparatus is to be had at the tinman's. Where the &s;aving of expen&s;e is an object, it may be effectually &s;up|plied by the following ea&s;y expedient: Fill a common watering-pot with cold water; let the patient &s;it down undre&s;&s;ed upon a &s;tool, which may be placed in a large tub; and let the hair, if not cut &s;hort, be &s;pread over the &s;houlders as loo&s;ely as po&s;&s;ible; then pour the water from the pot over the patient's head, face, neck, &s;houlders, and all parts of the body progre&s;&s;ively down to the feet, till the whole has been thoroughly bathed. Let the patient then be rubbed dry, and take gentle exerci&s;e, as has been already recommended, until the &s;en&s;ation of cold be &s;ucceeded by a gentle glow all over him. When we fir&s;t re&s;ort to this kind of bath, it may be u&s;ed gently, and with water having &s;ome degree of warmth,
<PB N="206" REF="039111_0236_1013A06934925BD8">
&s;o as not to make the &s;hock too great; but, as the patient becomes accu&s;tomed to it, the degree of cold may be increa&s;ed, the water may be allowed to fall from a greater height, and the holes in the pan may be made larger, &s;o as to make the &s;hower heavier. A large &s;ponge may, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, be &s;ub&s;tituted for a watering-pot.</P>
<P>Although the Shower Bath does not cov|er the &s;urface of the body &s;o univer&s;ally as the u&s;ual cold baths, this circum&s;tance is rather favourable than otherwi&s;e: for tho&s;e parts, which the water has not touched, feel the impre&s;&s;ion by &s;ympathy, as much as tho&s;e in actual contact with it. Every drop of wa|ter becomes a partial cold bath in miniature, and thus a &s;tronger impre&s;&s;ion is excited than in any other mode of bathing. The Shower Bath, for the following rea&s;ons, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es ad|vantages &s;uperior to all others. 1. The &s;ud|den contact of the water, which in the com|mon bath is only momentary, may here be prolonged, repeated, and made &s;low or quick, or modified at plea&s;ure. 2. The head and brea&s;t, which are expo&s;ed to &s;ome inconve|nience and danger in the common bath, are here at once &s;ecured, by receiving the fir&s;t &s;hock of the water; the blood is con&s;equent|ly impelled to the lower parts of the body; and the patient finds no ob&s;truction in breath|ing, or undulations of blood towards the head. 3. The heavy pre&s;&s;ure on the body occa&s;ioned by the weight of the water, and the free cir|culation of the blood in the parts touched by it, being, for &s;ome time at lea&s;t, interrupted,
<PB N="207" REF="039111_0237_1013A0292E2D4DE8">
make the u&s;ual way of bathing often more detrimental than u&s;eful. The Shower Bath, on the contrary, de&s;cends in &s;ingle drops, which are at once more &s;timulating and plea&s;|ant than the immer&s;ion into cold water, and it can be more readily procured, and more ea&s;ily modified and adapted to the circum&s;tan|ces of the patient.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this Chapter with &s;ome account of what is called the <HI>A&euml;rial</HI> or <HI>Air Bath.</HI> This is a late invention, the effects of which have not yet been &s;ufficiently a&s;cer|tained. Experience informs us, that by ex|po&s;ing the naked body for a &s;hort time to an agreeable cool, nay to a cold air, we perceive effects &s;omewhat &s;imilar to tho&s;e produced by the cold bath; particularly that of a plea&s;ant &s;en&s;ation of heat diffu&s;ed over the whole body, after having again dre&s;&s;ed. There is little danger of catching cold upon this oc|ca&s;ion: for in a place where we already feel a certain degree of cold in our u&s;ual dre&s;s, the &s;en&s;ation of it will not be much increa&s;ed, if we undre&s;s altogether. It may al&s;o be re|marked, that with the <HI>whole</HI> body naked, we have much le&s;s to apprehend from the effects of cold, than by expo&s;ing or keeping one part of it le&s;s covered than another.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lord M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nboddo,</HI> the author of "<HI>Ancient Metaphy&s;ics,</HI>" who died in May 1799, in his 90th year, till very lately accu&s;tomed him|&s;elf to take violent exerci&s;e, when quite undre&s;&s;ed, in the open air.

This &s;pecies of bath certainly de&s;erves far|ther trials. A &s;pacious apartment, with open windows, may &s;erve every purpo&s;e of moving in the free air. And here I would recom|mend to all who are engaged in &s;edentary and literary pur&s;uits, to walk with their heads uncovered in an open, and even in the colde&s;t air, as being a &s;imple and excellent means to &s;trengthen the head, and to remove tho&s;e complaints which ari&s;e from inten&s;e thought and clo&s;e mental application.</P>
<P>To rub the body with woollen cloths, or with &s;oft bru&s;hes, is of great advantage, by gently &s;timulating the fibres, increa&s;ing the circulation of the fluids to the external parts, and promoting a free per&s;piration, together with all the other evacuations. Per&s;ons of a delicate habit, of a &s;edentary life, and tho&s;e who are liable to &s;udden twitches of the ten|dons, cramps, and lamene&s;s, may effectually relieve, or rather prevent the&s;e complaints, by cau&s;ing the whole body, particularly the limbs, to be rubbed every morning and evening, for about half an hour, with rough cloths or &s;oft bru&s;hes, till the &s;kin becomes red. This fric|tion is &s;till more beneficial to the aged than to the young; and it may in a great mea&s;|ure produce the &s;alutary effects of bodily ex|erci&s;e.</P>
<P>Frequent cutting the hair is of advantage to the eyes, the ears, and to the whole body. So the daily wa&s;hing of the head with cold water, is an excellent remedy again&s;t periodi|cal head-achs. In coryzas, or defluxions of the humours from the head, and in weak eyes,
<PB N="209" REF="039111_0239_1013A02AB43EC950">
the &s;having of the head often affords im|mediate relief; while at the &s;ame time it opens the pores, and promotes per&s;piration. It is altogether a mi&s;taken idea, that there is a danger of catching cold from the practice of wa&s;hing the head, or leaving it expo&s;ed to the free air, after having been wa&s;hed. The more frequently the &s;urface is clean&s;ed of &s;curvy and &s;caly impurities, the more ea&s;y and comfortable we feel. The oftener the hair is cut, the more quickly it grows again; and this ea&s;y operation &s;upplies the place of a con&s;tant bli&s;ter or artificial i&s;&s;ue.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>All &s;ecret compo&s;itions or pomatums for making the hair grow long and thick, are little better than fraud and impo&s;ition, and gen|erally con&s;i&s;t of noxious ingredients. In place of them, I recommend a &s;imple mixture of olive oil and &s;pirits of ro&s;emary; to which may be added, a few drops of oil of nutmeg. With this mixture let the hair be anointed every night; but &s;paringly at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>To change the hair to a darker colour, the liquid remedies &s;old by the perfumers are generally dangerous, as con&s;i&s;ting of lead, antimo|ny, and other metallic &s;olutions. The only method to be pur&s;ued with &s;afety is, to cut the hair pretty clo&s;e to the head, and comb it morning and evening with a leaden comb, which &s;imple proce&s;s can|not injure or check the per&s;piration of the head.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>Friction of the &s;oles of the feet is very ad|vantageous; but, on account of the great number of highly &s;en&s;ible nerves in them, &s;uch practice mu&s;t not be carried to exce&s;s. A proper degree of warmth and per&s;piration in the feet is always a favourable &s;ymptom of health. Be&s;ides, they &s;hould often be bathed in cold, or, &s;till better, in lukewarm water, well rubbed, and the nails cautiou&s;ly cut. There will then be no danger of the nails growing into the fle&s;h, or of corns or other callo&s;ities ari&s;ing in the feet. All the methods hitherto di&s;covered of extracting corns, afford only

<HI>temporary</HI> ea&s;e; and it is very dangerous to cut them too deep, on account of the many nerves running in every direction of the toes. Ea&s;y &s;hoes, frequent bathing the feet in luke|warm water, with a little &s;alt and pot-a&s;hes di&s;&s;olved in it, and a pla&s;ter made of equal parts of Gum Galbanum, Saffron, and Cam|phor, are the only remedies I can recommend again&s;t this trouble&s;ome complaint.</P>

<P>Of DRESS;&mdash;the advantages and di&s;advantages of the u&s;ual mode of Clothing con&s;idered, together with propo&s;als for remedying its defects.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>IN con&s;idering the various articles of Dre&s;s, attention mu&s;t be paid both to their <HI>&s;ub|&s;tance</HI> and <HI>form.</HI> Our mode of clothing may occa&s;ion trouble, di&s;ea&s;e, and death&mdash;1. When we attempt by it to improve &s;ome &s;uppo&s;ed defects of the body, which cannot be done without injury; and, 2. When it con&s;i&s;ts of improper &s;ub&s;tances, whether u&s;ed from ne|ce&s;&s;ity, or in compliance with fa&s;hion and ca|price.</P>
<P>To avoid ridicule, we comply with the pre|vailing fa&s;hions of the day; but, if this com|pliance be prejudical to health, it &s;hows great weakne&s;s to allow our&s;elves to be carried away with the &s;tream; and although a deviation from the mode may, for the moment, excite the ridicule of the thoughtle&s;s, yet tho&s;e who have the boldne&s;s to oppo&s;e the Tyrant, when his dictatorial mandates are injurious to health, will in the end triumph, and they may them|&s;elves have the &s;atisfaction to introduce dre&s;&s;|es, at once healthful and elegant. Happily, in this re&s;pect, people begin in &s;ome degree to think for them&s;elves; that rigid adherence to the mode, which heretofore dre&s;&s;ed both men and women as much in uniform &s;uits as a regiment of &s;oldiers, does not now di&s;|gu&s;t us.</P>

The general properties of a good dre&s;s are the three following:&mdash;1. That it be not &s;o hard and unpliable, as to ob&s;truct the free and ea&s;y motion of the joints, and be uncomfort|able, either from its weight or tightne&s;s:&mdash;2. That it pre&s;erve the body in that degree of temperature which is mo&s;t agreeable, as well as mo&s;t &s;uitable to the different functions and motions in a healthy &s;tate;&mdash;and, 3.

<HEAD>On the Materials u&s;ed for Articles of Dre&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>THE property of receiving, repelling, and emitting heat and cold, depends not only on the &s;ub&s;tance from which our dre&s;s is made, and its &s;hape or form, but al&s;o on the colour. Clothes of a light colour have the lea&s;t attrac|tion for heat, and therefore are the mo&s;t prop|er in hot weather. Sub&s;tances of a very &s;mooth and &s;hining &s;urface &s;trongly reflect the rays of the &s;un, which cannot penetrate through them; hence the advantage, in hot climates, of hats covered with oil-&s;kin, partic|ularly of a green or white colour, of &s;mooth and &s;hining &s;hoes, glazed gowns, and the like. Dazzling colours are offen&s;ive, and a per&s;on who &s;uffers from weak eyes will injure them &s;till more by wearing crim&s;on or &s;carlet, or being much in company with others thus dre&s;&s;ed. For a &s;imilar rea&s;on, &s;plendid white
<PB N="213" REF="039111_0243_1013A03007406648">
dre&s;&s;es, &s;teel buttons, gold and &s;ilver lace, and all ornaments of this &s;ort, are detrimental to vi&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Animal Wool</HI> produces a moderate warmth, on account of the &s;timulus and gentle friction it occa&s;ions on the &s;kin. By its u&s;e, animal electricity is elicited, per&s;piration promoted, the per&s;pired humours are ab&s;orbed, and again ea&s;ily evaporated, on account of the porous nature of this &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P><HI>Linen Cloth,</HI> by dimini&s;hing the ela&s;ticity of the &s;kin, increa&s;es the internal warmth, and at the &s;ame time, from its compactne&s;s, retains too readily the per&s;pirable humours, and does not part with them &s;o readily as wool. Soil|ed &s;hirts therefore produce a di&s;agreeable cool|ing &s;en&s;ation, and &s;top per&s;piration, e&s;pecially if made of thick &s;trong cloth, and not regu|larly changed every day.</P>
<P><HI>Silk</HI> occa&s;ions a gentle &s;timulus, but does not &s;ufficiently promote per&s;piration, though it attracts le&s;s humidity from the atmo&s;phere than linen.</P>
<P><HI>Oil-&s;kin,</HI> or wax-cloth, increa&s;es per&s;piration in an uncommon degree, but does not admit it to evaporate again, and is therefore appli|cable only in certain di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>Cotton</HI> &s;tands in the middle between animal wool and linen; it increa&s;es warmth and per|&s;piration, imbibes and retains the per&s;pired humours, to the injury of the wearer, and like wool readily attracts infectious matter.</P>
<P>All kinds of <HI>Fur</HI> are more noxious than u&s;e|ful, both with re&s;pect to their &s;tructure and con&s;tituent parts. They contain many alka|line
<PB N="214" REF="039111_0244_1013A071F2C15CC8">
and oily particles; they are generally too compact and unequal on the &s;urface; they too much &s;timulate and increa&s;e per&s;piration, by promoting the acce&s;s of humours to the &s;kin; they do not allow the per&s;pirable matter to e&s;cape, &s;oon acquire an intolerable &s;mell, and, more than any other &s;ub&s;tance, attract and retain contagious effluvia. Experience in|forms us, that nations who dre&s;s in fur, par|ticularly in hot countries, are frequently ex|po&s;ed to di&s;ea&s;es, owing to a want of cleanli|ne&s;s and free per&s;piration; &s;uch are the putrid fevers of Hungary, the plague among the Turks, and the &s;ingular di&s;ea&s;e of the hair in Poland, called <HI>plica polonica,</HI> which curls the whole hair into a number of twi&s;ts, that have the appearance of &s;o many grea&s;y &s;trings, and afford a gha&s;tly &s;pectacle.</P>
<P>We ought, therefore, to choo&s;e a dre&s;s agreeable to the &s;ea&s;on and weather, as well as to the con&s;titution of the body. Woollen clothes are the mo&s;t proper in &s;pring, autumn, and winter; becau&s;e they moderately warm the body, do not weaken it by the ab&s;traction of too many exhalations, and have the fewe&s;t points of contact, or, in other words, do not attach &s;o clo&s;e to the body, as any other ma|terials of dre&s;s.</P>
<P>In &s;ummer, mo&s;t people are accu&s;tomed to wear thin clothes, which are &s;carcely proper in our changeable climate. It is not, in that &s;ea&s;on, advi&s;able to take much exerci&s;e in thin dre&s;&s;es, particularly in the heat of the day. Nor &s;hould we venture to wear &s;uch clothes early in the morning, when the air is cool,
<PB N="215" REF="039111_0245_1013A033038CDFE0">
and the pores of the &s;kin have been dilated by the warmth of the bed;&mdash;but &s;till le&s;s in the evening, when the heat of the day has &s;o much opened them, that per&s;piration may be ea&s;ily checked, and health materially injured.</P>
<P>In our variable climate, it would be prefer|able to adopt a &s;pecies of dre&s;s, which is near|ly uniform in all &s;ea&s;ons; for as thin clothes are more immediately pervaded by heat, dur|ing the lea&s;t exerci&s;e, it certainly would be more prudent and rational to wear a dre&s;s that is calculated to with&s;tand the effects both of cold and heat. That there is no danger in adopting a general dre&s;s for all &s;ea&s;ons; that, on the contrary, it is the mo&s;t beneficial plan of managing the body, with regard to the mo&s;t important function, namely, that of per|&s;piration, I &s;hall endeavour to prove in the next Section.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>On the immediate Covering of the Skin.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t and principal rule with re&s;pect to this &s;ubject is, that <HI>the covering of the &s;kin ought to be always the &s;ame, and not be changed accord|ing to the &s;ea&s;on and the weather.</HI> The u&s;ual con&s;equence of this change is, in the fir&s;t place, an unea&s;y and painful &s;en&s;ation. A &s;kin ac|cu&s;tomed to fine linen only, cannot endure the &s;en&s;ation occa&s;ioned by a coar&s;er kind; and cotton is &s;till more di&s;agreeable, but, mo&s;t of all, animal wool or flannel. In the next place, to change the dre&s;s according to the weather,
<PB N="216" REF="039111_0246_1013A0748AED5530">
occupies more time, and requires more ex|pen&s;e, than is convenient to the great ma&s;s of the people.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, there are many who, from mi&s;taken maxims of health, accommodate the covering of their &s;kins to the &s;ea&s;ons: they dre&s;s them&s;elves in winter in flannel, towards &s;pring and autumn in cotton, and in &s;ummer in linen; a method as ab&s;urd as it is danger|ous. Notwith&s;tanding the difficulties, which each of the&s;e changes mu&s;t produce, while we undergo this new trial on our &s;kin, we expo&s;e our&s;elves at the &s;ame time, in every &s;uch change, to all po&s;&s;ible dangers ari&s;ing from cold and repelled per&s;piration. This cu&s;tom is the more dangerous, as it is u&s;ually prac|ti&s;ed by the infirm, the tender, and the aged, who regulate them&s;elves le&s;s by the tempera|ture of the weather, than by the days of the almanack, when they are periodically accu&s;|tomed to change their dre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion, then, which is the <HI>mo&s;t proper covering of the &s;kin,</HI> is ea&s;ily an&s;wered. <HI>Animal wool</HI> &s;eems to recommend it&s;elf to us by the very circum&s;tance, that hair is the general covering of tho&s;e animals which mo&s;t re&s;em|ble man in their &s;tructure. If men were ha|bituated to go naked in the colder climates, the human body would, no doubt, al&s;o be bet|ter covered with hair. Animals, in winter as well as in &s;ummer, have the &s;ame coat, except that in the colde&s;t &s;ea&s;on their hair is uni|formly &s;omewhat thicker and longer, con&s;e|quently al&s;o warmer than in &s;ummer, e&s;pecially in the northern countries.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="039111_0247_1013A0359915BCD8">
Not only analogy, but experience al&s;o proves, that wool worn next the &s;kin has indi&s;puta|ble advantages over all other &s;ub&s;tances. For, 1. Flannel is but a &s;low conductor of <HI>external</HI> heat to the body, and it the more ea&s;ily at|tracts <HI>internal</HI> heat, and allows it to evaporate the more readily, as it is more porous than any other texture. 2. A &s;ultry atmo&s;phere is extremely trouble&s;ome, particularly where great heat is combined with moi&s;ture, the hu|midity checking per&s;piration, and at the &s;ame time conducting too many aqueous particles to the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els from without. Here then flannel is of incomparable &s;ervice, &s;ince it keeps the ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin con&s;tantly open, cau&s;es them to per&s;pire freely, and admits but a very &s;mall degree of external moi&s;ture.</P>
<P>The principal good effect of flannel, how|ever, con&s;i&s;ts in its gentle and beneficial &s;tim|ulus, or that friction which it occa&s;ions on the &s;kin, and by which it opens the pores. We mu&s;t not imagine, that flannel <HI>of it&s;elf</HI> heats more than linen or cotton; for it is not the heat which occa&s;ions inconvenience, but the circum&s;tance of the per&s;pirable matter adher|ing to the &s;kin. In flannel, we may per&s;pire without danger, and undertake any exerci&s;e of the body, without di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ations; not &s;o, when linen remains wet on the &s;kin. If we taken violent exerci&s;e in flannel, per&s;pi|ration is nece&s;&s;arily increa&s;ed, but the per&s;pired matter is communicated through the flan|nel to the atmo&s;phere, and the &s;kin remains dry, warm, and comfortable. If we take the &s;ame exerci&s;e in linen &s;hirts, per&s;piration is
<PB N="218" REF="039111_0248_1013A07717D5F590">
indeed al&s;o increa&s;ed, but the per&s;pired matter is not imparted to the atmo&s;phere, but is in|&s;pi&s;&s;ated in a fluid &s;tate, clogs the linen, and remains in contact with the &s;kin.</P>
<P>Another advantage which flannel po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es over linen and cotton is, that people per&s;piring profu&s;ely in flannel &s;hirts, may &s;afely ven|ture into the open air, and will not ea&s;ily catch cold, becau&s;e flannel does not ab&s;orb the per|&s;pired humours. If we do the &s;ame in linen &s;hirts, the &s;kin will &s;oon be wetted by per&s;pi|ration, which will occa&s;ion a &s;en&s;ation of cool|ne&s;s and &s;hivering; in mo&s;t ca&s;es a violent cold, and very frequently an inflammation of the lungs, will be the con&s;equence. This dan|ger ari&s;es from the fluid matter &s;ettling on the &s;kin; and we may be &s;till more &s;everely injured, if we at the &s;ame time expo&s;e our|&s;elves to the action of the wind, or a current of air.</P>
<P>Numberle&s;s writers, both ancient and mod|ern, confirm the good effects of flannel next the &s;kin: of the&s;e I &s;hall only quote COUNT RUMFORD, who &s;ays, in one of his earlier E&s;|&s;ays, that he is convinced of the utility of flannel &s;hirts in all &s;ea&s;ons; that he has worn them in all climates, in the warme&s;t apart|ments, and in the mo&s;t fatiguing exerci&s;e, without the lea&s;t difficulty; that he was re|lieved, by the u&s;e of flannel, from a pain in his brea&s;t he had been frequently &s;ubject to, and never &s;ince knew an hour's illne&s;s; and that nothing exceeds the agreeable &s;en&s;ation of this dre&s;s, when people have been once ac|cu&s;tomed to it.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="039111_0249_1013A0B4658DB948">
Indeed after the prai&s;es be&s;towed upon flan|nel, by &s;o many re&s;pectable authorities, and by men who from long experience have a&s;|certained its beneficial effects, it is &s;urpri&s;ing that any individual, however great his repu|tation, &s;hould be whim&s;ical or hardy enough to di&s;pute its <HI>general</HI> &s;alubrity, merely with a view to e&s;tabli&s;h a favourite hypothe&s;is.</P>
<P>It has been objected, that flannel worn next the &s;kin is debilitating, becau&s;e it too much increa&s;es per&s;piration; but this is not found|ed on truth, &s;ince per&s;piration, <HI>as long as the &s;kin remains dry,</HI> never can be hurtful, nor im|moderate. Such mi&s;taken notions have been propagated, from the circum&s;tance, that flan|nel is frequently ordered by phy&s;icians, to in|crea&s;e per&s;piration in &s;ome di&s;ea&s;es, where it is nece&s;&s;ary to the recovery of the patient: <HI>but the copious per&s;piration is then the effect of the di&s;ea&s;e, and not of the flannel.</HI></P>
<P>The unea&s;y &s;en&s;ation occa&s;ioned by flannel is of very &s;hort duration. That it may make the &s;kin red and inflamed, if it be too much rubbed and &s;cratched, cannot be denied; but it is a palpable fal&s;ity that it produces cutane|ous eruptions. It has quite a contrary effect; as it pre&s;erves the pores open, increa&s;es per|&s;piration, and thus removes the cau&s;e of cu|taneous di&s;ea&s;es, which ari&s;e chiefly from a checked and irregular &s;tate of excretion by the pores.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to another objection again&s;t the wearing of flannel, it is certain, that a flannel &s;hirt or wai&s;tcoat may pre&s;erve the body as
<PB N="220" REF="039111_0250_1013A07AB1197928">
clean, and much cleaner, than linen, <HI>if as fre|quently changed.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This preliminary condition, I pre&s;ume, &s;ufficiently an&s;wers the objection of a learned writer, according to whom a flannel dre&s;s re|quires a more frequent change than linen, <HI>to promote cleanline&s;s,</HI> and con&s;equently would produce a contrary effect among the lower cla&s;&s;|es of people. Yet, in other re&s;pects, I fully agree with the celebra|ted HUFELAND, who lays down the following conditions and limita|tions in what relates to the u&s;e of flannel:&mdash;"Upon the whole, &s;ays he, I am of opinion that it would not be advi&s;able, at lea&s;t to chil|dren and young per&s;ons, <HI>univer&s;ally</HI> to adopt a woollen texture for the covering of the &s;kin. It is, however, a <HI>&s;alutary</HI> dre&s;s to the&s;e who, in all probability, have commenced the &s;econd half of their life; to all cold or phlegmatic temperaments; to all who lead a &s;edentary life; to individuals &s;ubject to catarrhs, or frequent colds, gout, diar|rhoea, and partial conge&s;tions of the blood; to all nervous patients and convale&s;cents from &s;evere chronic di&s;orders; to per&s;ons who are too &s;u&s;ceptible of the impre&s;&s;ions of the atmo&s;phere; and, la&s;tly, in &s;uch climates and pur&s;uits of life as are expo&s;ed to frequent and &s;ud|den changes of air.&mdash;It is, on the contrary, <HI>hurtful</HI> to all tho&s;e, with|out exception, who are already &s;ubject to violent per&s;piration, or troubled with cutaneous eruptions, and who cannot afford to change their under dre&s;s as often as is con&s;i&s;tent with cleanline&s;s."</P>
<P>Profe&s;&s;or Hufeland, doubtle&s;s, meant to &s;ay that the wearing of flannel next the &s;kin is <HI>then only hurtful,</HI> if none of the conditions be|fore &s;pecified reconcile its u&s;e; for, even in ca&s;es apparently doubtful, the temporary wearing of flannel is not attended with &s;uch danger as might perhaps re&s;ult from neglecting its application. But although it he obviou&s;ly conducive to health, the Profe&s;&s;or recommends only &s;uch a texture of wool, as is &s;ufficiently porous, and neither too rough nor too thick. Coar&s;e woollen &s;tockings in winter, and thin ones in &s;ummer, ought in his opinion to be more generally worn. Tho&s;e per&s;ons, la&s;tly, who are in a good &s;tate of health, and have no partic|ular rea&s;on for wearing flannel, or who&s;e &s;kin is too irritable, may find it, he thinks, beneficial to wear a cloth fabricated of a mixed tex|ture of cotton and linen.</P>

<P>Wool, on account of its rough &s;urface, is more calculated to ab&s;orb infectious morbid matter, than a more &s;mooth &s;ub&s;tance; but we have nothing to apprehend from flannel on the &s;kin, and under the u&s;ual dre&s;s. I am rather of opinion, that it is a better preven|tive again&s;t contagion than any other; becau&s;e, while it encourages per&s;piration, it at the &s;ame
<PB N="221" REF="039111_0251_1013A0B91876A260">
time removes the inhaled poi&s;onous particles, particularly if, in ca&s;es of danger, per&s;piration be increa&s;ed by other &s;uitable means. Hence people wearing flannel on their &s;kin, never &s;uffer from cold. I have been informed, that the manufacturers in the different founderies of Birmingham, as well as at the iron-works of Colebrook-Dale and Kettley, in the mo&s;t inten&s;e heat, wear no other but flannel &s;hirts; and that without the&s;e it would be impo&s;&s;ible to prevent continual colds, and the mo&s;t fa|tal di&s;ea&s;es. With this beneficent intention, the Briti&s;h &s;oldiers upon the Continent, &s;ome years ago, were furni&s;hed with flannel wai&s;t|coats, by the liberal &s;ub&s;criptions of individu|als, which, I am convinced, &s;aved many lives that mu&s;t otherwi&s;e have fallen victims to the effects of a cold and moi&s;t climate.</P>
<P>The&s;e advantages &s;trongly recommend the u&s;e of flannel to every one anxious to pre&s;erve his health, but particularly to tho&s;e who are expo&s;ed to all kinds of weather, as hu&s;band|men, fi&s;hermen, mariners, &s;oldiers, and trav|ellers. As flannel is &s;uitable to all &s;ea&s;ons; as it requires no great changes in the under dre&s;s; and as it is a tolerable &s;ub&s;titute for a defi|ciency of upper dre&s;s; it de&s;erves every atten|tion among tho&s;e who provide for orphan and poor-hou&s;es, as well as for the indigent of eve|ry de&s;cription. Many de&s;perate di&s;ea&s;es in the legs of the common people, many inflam|mations of the throat, brea&s;t and lungs, might be prevented, and many lives &s;aved, both of children and adults, if flannel were more gen|erally worn.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="039111_0252_1013A07C35715DB0">
Tho&s;e who complain of cold legs and feet, are never comfortable nor healthy; if they could be prevailed upon to wear wor&s;ted &s;tockings and flannel drawers, they would acquire a quicker circulation of the blood in the lower extremities, and prevent many trou|bles and indi&s;po&s;itions, from which, without this precaution, they cannot e&s;cape. Mo&s;t valetudinarians and patients &s;light this advice, becau&s;e they imagine that the wearing of flan|nel is attended with unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations. This idea, however, ought not to prevent them from giving it a fair trial; for the uncom|fortable feeling continues only for a few days, as I have my&s;elf experienced; and this trifling &s;acrifice cannot be compared with the &s;aluta|ry effects, which flannel next the &s;kin almo&s;t uniformly produces. By continuing it &s;uffi|ciently long, and changing it frequently, the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate gouty and rheumatic com|plaints have often been removed, and many other imminent dangers averted. Children afflicted with rickets, cannot be better reliev|ed than by a proper diet, and flannel &s;hirts, which may be daily fumigated with amber, petroleum, or other fragrant &s;ub&s;tances; a proce&s;s, which has been frequently productive of the mo&s;t beneficial effects.</P>

<P>COTTON &s;tockings, which are &s;o generally worn at pre&s;ent, are highly objectionable.&mdash;
<PB N="223" REF="039111_0253_1013A0BA9DDAFD78">
There is no part of the human frame, which per&s;pires &s;o much as the feet. The di&s;agree|able &s;en&s;ation cold feet produce is well known; for the connexion between the feet and head, the &s;tomach, the uterus, and many other im|portant parts of the human &s;y&s;tem, is &s;o inti|mate, that gout, &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the critical evacuations, pain in the excretory organs, nay cancer, inflammation of the uterus, and abortion, may be the con&s;equence of cold feet and legs, which are the nece&s;&s;ary effects of wearing cotton and &s;ilk &s;tockings. Cotton and linen worn next the &s;kin, if once filled with per&s;pirable matter, do not admit any more to pa&s;s through them; a glutinous and cooling moi&s;ture accumulates, and it is not ea&s;y to keep the feet thoroughly clean in this dre&s;s. Tho&s;e who alternately wear cotton and wor&s;ted &s;tockings, mu&s;t &s;oon ob&s;erve the difference in the exhalation and moi&s;ture pe|culiar to each. Cotton, though &s;omewhat better than linen, is &s;till much inferior to wool, which is alone calculated to ab&s;orb and exhale the noxious humours emitted by the pores.</P>
<P>The reciprocal effect of the per&s;piration of the feet, and of the leather of the &s;hoes, is greater than is commonly believed.

view of promoting this &s;alutary &s;ecretion. In&s;tead of pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">iting by this hint of nature, mankind have been imprudently and unac|countably &s;tudious to &s;top that canal; imag|ining this to be the &s;afe&s;t way of pre&s;erving the feet dry, and free from all di&s;agreeable &s;mell. Dry feet are certainly preferable to moi&s;t: but the means of promoting per&s;pira|tion are al&s;o the only means capable of keep|ing the feet dry, and free from any unplea&s;|ant fetor. It is al&s;o improper and unhealthy to wear any other but woollen gloves, which ought to be worn by all females, who wi&s;h to improve the &s;kin of their hands and arms; no co&s;metics OF wa&s;hes are &s;o certain and &s;o powerful in their effects: on the contrary, all external applications, unle&s;s a&s;&s;i&s;ted by inter|nal remedies, are attended with the po&s;itive ruin of &s;kin, bloom, and health.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons who have a great tendency to per|&s;pire in their feet, and who increa&s;e this ex|udation by much walking or dancing, will no doubt be &s;en&s;ible, that their cotton, thread, or &s;ilk &s;tockings, in&s;tead of removing the tran&s;pired matter, actually ab&s;orb it; bring it in contact with the &s;kin; pre&s;erve it in a &s;tate of heat favourable to putrefaction; and check all farther per&s;piration.</P>
<P>That the feet are more expo&s;ed to the ef|fects of cold, and to &s;tagnations of the fluids, than any other part of the body, is unque&s;|tionable: 1&s;t, becau&s;e they are the mo&s;t re|mote parts from the heart, and the quickne&s;s of the circulation of the blood decrea&s;es in proportion to that di&s;tance; and 2d, the
<PB N="225" REF="039111_0255_1013A0BD2E477D08">
blood circulating downwards makes its way to the heart &s;omewhat &s;lower, on account of its own gravity. By this &s;lowne&s;s in the cir|culation, more watery particles are depo&s;ited by the blood. It is therefore nece&s;&s;ary to keep the feet &s;omewhat warmer than the re&s;t of the body, in order to encourage the mo|tion of the fluids to the upper parts. Wool|len &s;tockings are excellently adapted for that purpo&s;e, and they ought to be cho&s;en rather thicker than tho&s;e flannels u&s;ed for &s;hirts and drawers. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, it is proper to prevent all moi&s;ture from without, by means of water-proof &s;hoes, provided with thick cork &s;oles for the winter, or with ela&s;tic &s;ocks of hor&s;e-hair.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ation produced by the feet in per&s;piring, is between the toes: this can only be prevented by wearing &s;tock|ings made with toes, like the fingers of gloves; becau&s;e the&s;e alone can ab&s;orb and prevent the vi&s;cid and fetid particles from fettling there. But as this propo&s;al is not likely to meet with the approbation of the votaries of fa&s;hion, I &s;hall &s;ub&s;titute an ea&s;ier method of remedying the unplea&s;ant effects of violent per&s;piration in the feet. A powders of burnt alum will overcome this fetor, by neutraliz|ing the acrid particles; and, at the &s;ame time, will not ob&s;truct the nece&s;&s;ary per&s;piration.</P>

The well known and excellent rule of keep|ing the head cool and the feet warm, is too much neglected, e&s;pecially by the lower cla&s;&s;es of the people in many countries, as in Scot|land, Holland, and Germany, and likewi&s;e among people of a certain age and de&s;cription in this country. The Scotch pea&s;ant wears his heavy bonnet, the Dutchman his cap, and the Turk his turban, without con&s;idering that &s;uch heavy loads are &s;tupifying, and that, while no attention is paid to keep their feet warm and dry, their heads are virtually con|verted into vapor-baths. In all countries, the man who lives at his ca&s;e, carefully covers his head with a warm night-cap; he &s;pends per|haps one half of the day in this unnatural dre&s;s, and prepares his head for frequent colds, at every &s;udden change in the atmo&s;phere. Be&s;ides, weakne&s;s of the head, pains, erup|tions, local plethora or fulne&s;s of blood, lo&s;s of the hair, lethargy, and at length &s;tupor or in&s;anity are often the effects of this impru|dence.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For &s;ome years the ladies, in&s;tead of tho&s;e horrid ma&s;&s;es of friz|zled hair, which u&s;ed at once to injure their health, and disfigure their faces, happily returned to beautiful and elegant nature; having their hair hanging down in graceful ringlets, while the only artificial covering was a &s;imple turban, or an ornamental bandeau. Of late, however, this ta&s;teful &s;tyle of decoration has been &s;ucceeded by un|natural, di&s;gu&s;ting, and unhealthful <HI>wigs;</HI> a fa&s;hion probably in|troduced by &s;ome ugly and bald woman, to reduce her gay and beautiful imitators to her own &s;tandard of deformity.</NOTE></P>
<P>In our moderate climate, we might &s;afely accu&s;tom our youth to go with the head un|covered; as Nature has already provided it with hair for that purpo&s;e. In very cold and hot countries, however, the head mu&s;t be
<PB N="227" REF="039111_0257_1013A0C0D836E9E0">
&s;lightly covered, to &s;helter it from cold, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> from the &s;till more dangerous vertical rays of the &s;un.</P>
<P>It is an in&s;tance of improvement in the edu|cation of children in England, that their ten|der heads are not &s;o much &s;hut up in clo&s;e caps, and fur bonnets, as tho&s;e upon the Con|tinent. A practice &s;o injudicious and hurtful de&s;erves no imitation; and yet there are ad|vocates for <HI>warm</HI> night-caps and wigs; they would &s;tarve their feet, while the head is en|clo&s;ed in an artificial &s;tove, which enfeebles their mental faculties, and dimini&s;hes their bodily vigour.</P>
<P>New-born children, and tho&s;e who are mo&s;t tender, require only an ea&s;y and moderately warm covering for the head, and this chiefly during the fir&s;t weeks, on account of the &s;oft|ne&s;s of their cranium, then but imperfectly o&s;&s;ified. Yet &s;uch a cap &s;hould be loo&s;ely tied, that it may not pre&s;s the head, nor cripple the mu&s;cles of the ears.</P>
<P>That the ear is naturally capable of &s;ome motion, is proved by the mu&s;cles with which it is provided. Its form, re&s;embling a &s;hell, is admirably adapted to receive and convey &s;ound. In the vain conceit, that a projecting ear, &s;o as the Author of nature has created it, is a deformity, nur&s;es and overwi&s;e matrons endeavour to pre&s;s the child's ear, from its fir&s;t appearance, clo&s;e to the head. Thus they render the &s;hell of the ear immovable, and dimini&s;h the capacity of hearing. A properly-expanded ear not only &s;trengthens the acute|ne&s;s of hearing, but likewi&s;e pre&s;erves this
<PB N="228" REF="039111_0258_1013A0850C0A7560">
u&s;eful &s;en&s;e to a great age, when the mu&s;cles of the internal organs of hearing become re|laxed.</P>
<P>To go with the head uncovered, in &s;un&s;hine, is certainly improper, both for children and adults; but our common black hats are ill calculated to avert the mi&s;chief, as they do not reflect the heat, but rather concentrate it in the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible manner upon the head. Hats of a white, or any other light colour, made of &s;traw or &s;imilar light materials, would be far preferable, particularly for peo|ple labouring in the fields, &s;oldiers, and trav|ellers. In very hot weather, a piece of white paper may be fa&s;tened with advantage on the crown of the hat.</P>
<P>As the hat ought likewi&s;e to &s;helter the eyes from too vivid a light, the brim &s;hould be broad enough to protect them, and the in|ner &s;ide of a green or blue, but not of a black, nor a dazzling colour. From the pre&s;ent mode, however, it appears that both ladies and gentlemen think a brim almo&s;t, if not al|together unnece&s;&s;ary, even when the power of the &s;un is mo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons &s;uffering from periodical head-achs, or who&s;e heads are otherwi&s;e unhealthy, &s;hould have their hair cut &s;hort. By this petty &s;acrifice, they will promote the nece&s;|&s;ary per&s;piration, the head will remain cool, and the cold bathing of it can be practi&s;ed with more advantage. In this point of view, wigs cannot be <HI>altogether</HI> condemned, as long as hair-dre&s;&s;ing, artificial braids, and other or|naments, form an e&s;&s;ential part of fa&s;hionable
<PB N="229" REF="039111_0259_1013A0C36CEB92A0">
dre&s;s. Be&s;ides, the wearers of wigs are, in a great mea&s;ure, exempt from many inconve|niences and evils attending the u&s;e of pow|der and pomatum. La&s;tly, if we mu&s;t choo&s;e one of the two maladies of the times, it is mo&s;t rational to adopt the lea&s;t noxious to health: and &s;o far I think a <HI>light wig</HI> is ju&s;tly preferable to a head enveloped in an artificial pa&s;te of powder and pomatum. Tho&s;e, how|ever, who are once accu&s;tomed to wear a wig, &s;hould not upon any account again let their hair grow in order to have it dre&s;&s;ed, pa&s;ted, and powdered anew.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to <HI>Shirts,</HI> the mo&s;t proper &s;ub|&s;tance having been before inve&s;tigated, I &s;hall only add, as to their form&mdash;that they may be &s;eriou&s;ly prejudicial to health, if too narrow in the collar, and in the wri&s;tbands. I have &s;een &s;everal in&s;tances of people attacked with &s;hortne&s;s of breath and difficulty of &s;peech, from this rea&s;on only, becau&s;e the blood can|not circulate freely, if the neck and wri&s;ts be tied or buttoned up too clo&s;ely. I was once pre&s;ent where a young man, playing at rack|ets, was &s;uddenly &s;eized with an apoplectic fit, the cau&s;e of which &s;eemed at fir&s;t inexplicable. As &s;oon, however, as his &s;hirt-collar, wri&s;t|bands and garters were loo&s;ened, he recov|ered.</P>
<P>Neckcloths, cravats, ribands, and necklaces of all &s;orts, <HI>when they are too tight,</HI> &s;top the ac|ce&s;s and retreat of the blood to and from the head, occa&s;ion accumulations of the blood and other fluids, head-achs, faintings, &s;tu|por, apoplexy, corro&s;ive ulcers of the &s;kin,
<PB N="230" REF="039111_0260_1013A086902A4288">
and innumerable other maladies. All cover|ings of the neck ought therefore to be con|&s;tantly worn loo&s;e. People who are liable to &s;ore throats, and di&s;ea&s;es of the brea&s;t, might gradually accu&s;tom them&s;elves, in mild and dry weather, to go with their necks as &s;lightly covered as po&s;&s;ible, and if fa&s;hion would per|mit it, to have no other covering but the col|lar of the &s;hirt. In cold and moi&s;t weather, a thin handkerchief might be added. But the modern cravats, filled with a &s;tiffening of cotton or wool, are extremely injurious to the part which they are intended to protect. For, by occa&s;ioning too great heat, they ren|der the neck unnaturally &s;en&s;ible to every change of the atmo&s;phere. It is rather &s;ur|pri&s;ing, that from a due &s;en&s;e of their perni|ciou&s;ne&s;s, we have rejected all coverings of the neck in children, as being trouble&s;ome and u&s;ele&s;s; and yet, in defiance of rea&s;on and experience, we continue to incumber our own necks with &s;uch bandages.</P>
<P>Necklaces and ribands, likewi&s;e, are gen|erally tied &s;o clo&s;e, as to pre&s;s with violence on that &s;uppo&s;ed deformity of the throat, vulgarly called the <HI>Adam's apple,</HI> which pro|jects le&s;s in the female than in the male &s;ex. The&s;e ribands and necklaces, when worn tight, are the more inconvenient and dangerous, if they be narrow and edged. Upon taking them off, which is too frequently neglected at night, they leave an impre&s;&s;ion on the neck, clearly proving the impediment they are to free mu&s;cular action, and what &s;tagna|tions, pain, and dangerous con&s;equences they
<PB N="231" REF="039111_0261_1013A0C4F4F4A018">
may occa&s;ion. The neck and throat, being alternately expanded and contracted, in &s;peak|ing, chewing, and &s;wallowing, it is the high|e&s;t degree of imprudence to ob&s;truct its mo|tion, for the &s;ake of appearance, vanity, or fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>Equally objectionable are tho&s;e black &s;tocks, that were formerly much in fa&s;hion, and are &s;till worn by &s;ome old beaux and military men. The latter indeed de&s;erve our compa&s;|&s;ion, from being obliged to wear the&s;e uncom|fortable collars; but the former ought to con&s;ider, that they expo&s;e them&s;elves to dan|gers, increa&s;ing as they advance in age, and rendering them every day more liable to ap|oplexy. I knew a regiment of &s;oldiers on the Continent, who&s;e Colonel was &s;o exce&s;&s;ive|ly fond of what he con&s;idered a martial ap|pearance, that he cau&s;ed his officers and men to have every article of their uniform remark|ably tight, particularly the &s;tocks, wai&s;tbands, and knee-garters. The con&s;equence was, that in the cour&s;e of a few months above the half of his regiment became &s;ubject to very ob&s;ti|nate cutaneous di&s;ea&s;es, and other ob&s;truc|tions, &s;o that they were unable to perform duty. Other regiments in the vicinity al&s;o &s;uffered from this de&s;tructive cu&s;tom; but the proportion of their di&s;abled &s;oldiers was like one to ten in the former. The late Dr. FOTHERGIL a&s;&s;erts, that the&s;e tight &s;tocks are productive of apoplexy, if a per&s;on look for &s;ome time, with his head turned, without moving his body. By this alone, he believes, people have brought on apoplectic &s;ymptoms.

For &s;uch a turn of the neck, when the body &s;tands fixed, dimini&s;hes the diameter of the jugular veins &s;o much, that a proportionate quantity of blood cannot return to them, from the ve&s;&s;els of the head and the brain.</P>
<P>Neckcloths or cravats, loo&s;ely tied, and not too thick, are therefore the only proper ones for <HI>Men;</HI> but as to <HI>Women</HI> and <HI>Children,</HI> it cannot be di&s;puted, that they would be bet|ter without any.</P>
<P><HI>Laced Stays</HI> are, among the better ranks of &s;ociety, at pre&s;ent out of fa&s;hion; &s;ince the Grecian form is ju&s;tly preferred to all artifi|cial &s;hapes. Yet, when we have adopted an u&s;eful habit our&s;elves, it is our duty to rec|ommend it to tho&s;e al&s;o who are &s;till follow|ing a de&s;tructive practice. And with this in|tention I cannot but reluctantly ob&s;erve, that nine tenths of the community &s;till wear the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ive <HI>&s;trait jackets,</HI> merely becau&s;e their mothers and grandmothers have done the &s;ame. I &s;hall therefore briefly &s;tate a few of the con&s;equences, ari&s;ing from this unnatural part of female dre&s;s, namely, di&s;ea&s;es of the brea&s;t, external callo&s;ities, and cancer it&s;elf; the ribs are comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">ed; the &s;pine is bent out of its place; the free expan&s;ion of the lungs is prevented; hence &s;hortne&s;s of breath, in|durations and tubercles of the lungs, cramp of the &s;tomach, defective dige&s;tion, nau&s;ea, irregularities in the &s;ecretory and other or|gans, and the like: in &s;hort, the li&s;t of the maladies thus produced is too long to be here detailed; and both married and unmarried ladies, for the &s;ake of compa&s;&s;ion, &s;hould ex|ert

all their influence, to convince the com|mon people of the injuries occa&s;ioned by &s;tiff laced &s;tays.

<P>All that has been &s;aid, with regard to laced &s;tays, is al&s;o applicable to &s;mall wai&s;ts, and tight coverings of the brea&s;t and the abdo|men.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fa&s;hion delights in extremes.

<P>Women &s;uffer much more by this bandage than men, who&s;e arms po&s;&s;e&s;s more mu&s;cular &s;trength, and have not the inter&s;tices of the mu&s;cles filled with fat, like the former.

arms, is thus ob&s;tructed, and many di&s;agreea|ble con&s;equences wantonly induced. Farther, the female arm is naturally &s;omewhat fuller from the &s;houlder downwards, and again be|comes &s;maller towards the joints of the hand: but in man, it is always more mu&s;cular a lit|tle below the elbow. From this difference in the &s;tructure, it is obvious, that the &s;leeves in a female dre&s;s lie clo&s;e to the whole arm, while tho&s;e of a man's coat but partially at|tach to it.</P>
<P>Many of the remarks already &s;ugge&s;ted, re&s;pecting the form and &s;ub&s;tance of other parts of dre&s;s, are likewi&s;e applicable to the article of <HI>breeches.</HI> If the&s;e be made of im|proper materials, or too tight in the wai&s;t|band, they mu&s;t occa&s;ion both unea&s;ine&s;s and injury to the body. Yet the ingenious ob|&s;ervations, lately publi&s;hed on this &s;ubject by Dr. FAUST, an eminent phy&s;ician in Germa|ny, are by no means &s;o conclu&s;ive, as to in|duce us to abandon an article of dre&s;s, not on|ly rendered nece&s;&s;ary by the laws of decorum, but which, when properly con&s;tructed, is even of con&s;iderable &s;ervice; ina&s;much as breeches, by their moderate pre&s;&s;ure, tend to &s;trengthen the relaxed parts of the body, particularly at a tender age.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t proper form of this ve&s;tment is, upon the whole, that of <HI>pantaloons;</HI> but they ought to be &s;ufficiently wide, of a thin cool|ing &s;ub&s;tance in &s;ummer, and of a warm ela&s;tic woollen cloth in winter.

If the wai&s;tband be too &s;trait, the free mo|tion of the internal parts of the abdomen will be ob&s;tructed, the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els of the in|te&s;tines prevented from performing their of|fices, and hypochondriacal complaints be ea&s;ily induced.

<P>There are many rea&s;ons, which delicacy for|bids me to mention, why it would be highly beneficial to the phy&s;ical and moral condition of females, to wear &s;ome kind of drawers, at lea&s;t after a certain age. This additional piece of dre&s;s would effectually prevent &s;everal in|conveniencies to which women are &s;ubject.&mdash;There are other circum&s;tances attending their u&s;ual dre&s;s, which contribute to bring on a premature &s;exual impul&s;e, and are apt to in|duce them to habits equally irregular and in|jurious to health.

Concerning the clothing of the legs, I mu&s;t in the fir&s;t place cen&s;ure the u&s;e of tight <HI>garters,</HI> particularly in men, to whom they are altogether unnece&s;&s;ary. Whether females can do without them, is &s;carcely fair to que&s;|tion: but if any &s;ub&s;titute or contrivance can be adopted in their place, it will amply com|pen&s;ate any little trouble or inconvenience: the &s;tockings can ea&s;ily be tied to &s;ome tape fa&s;tened to the wai&s;tband. This apparently trifling improvement is of greater moment, than many are inclined to imagine; for garters are undoubtedly the cau&s;e of much mi&s;chief, whether tied below or above the knee. The part to which they are applied, acquires an unnatural hardne&s;s; they di&s;po&s;e the thighs and legs to drop&s;y, induce great fatigue in walking, and are very probably the cau&s;e, that certain per&s;ons &s;o frequently &s;tum|ble, fall, and di&s;locate or break the knee-pan. The great difference in walking, with and without garters, I have my&s;elf &s;ufficiently ex|perienced. Many years ago, when in com|pliance with early habits and prejudices, I was accu&s;tomed to the u&s;e of garters, I could not walk or ride half a dozen miles without fa|tigue; which inconvenience I found immedi|ately remedied, on abandoning tho&s;e improp|er ligaments.</P>
<P>The advantages of woollen <HI>&s;tockings</HI> have been already pointed out. Upper &s;tockings of &s;ilk, cotton or linen, will be no impediment; and they may be cho&s;en of thicker or thinner quality, according to the weather and &s;ea&s;on. But the be&s;t &s;tockings may become hurtful, if
<PB N="237" REF="039111_0267_1013A0CDC66350A0">
too &s;hort in the feet, and may bring on a &s;pa&s;modic rigidity, and di&s;tortion of the toes. If, on the other hand, the feet of the &s;tockings are too wide, &s;o that they make folds in the &s;hoes, they will injure the &s;kin by their fric|tion, and be attended with painful con&s;equen|ces. The &s;tockings of children ought neither to cover the knees, nor be tied in any other manner, than by fa&s;tening them with &s;trings to the wai&s;tband; otherwi&s;e they will increa&s;e the &s;ize of the knees, render them preternat|urally thick, and may produce white &s;well|ings, and other dangerous maladies.</P>
<P>Boots, if too tight, and made of thick leather, are &s;o injurious to health, and &s;o trouble&s;ome in walking, that no rea&s;onable being will be inclined to force his feet and legs into them. The con&s;equences of a prac|tice, as hurtful as it is injudicious, are obvi|ous from the preceding ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>The con&s;tant u&s;e of boots contracts the &s;ize of the legs, particularly the calves, as may be daily ob&s;erved in military men, and the fa&s;h|ionable loungers of Bond-&s;treet and Pall-Mall.</P>
<P>I now proceed to the la&s;t, but not the lea&s;t important part of our dre&s;s, namely, <HI>Shoes.</HI> The celebrated Dutch anatomi&s;t, CAMPER, did not con&s;ider this &s;ubject unworthy of his attention, as he publi&s;hed a particular work, "<HI>On the proper Form and Size of Shoes,</HI>" as late as the year 1781. The &s;hoes ought to be of the &s;ize of the foot; they &s;hould be al&s;o ac|commodated to the degree of motion or exer|ci&s;e, and to the nature of the &s;oil and place, in which we wear them; circum&s;tances that
<PB N="238" REF="039111_0268_1013A08F85AF4E98">
are at pre&s;ent too little attended to. A &s;hoe that is bigger than the foot, prevents a firm &s;tep; while one which is too narrow occa|&s;ions pain and trouble&s;ome corns. Many volumes have been written on the Art of Shoeing that noble and u&s;eful animal, the Hor&s;e:&mdash;it is con&s;idered as a fundamental rule in Farriery, that the &s;hoe mu&s;t be nei|ther &s;maller nor larger than the hoof; and yet mankind can &s;ubmit to &s;crew their feet into a narrower compa&s;s than is intended by Nature. How frequently do we &s;mile at the Chine&s;e, who, from a tyrannical cu&s;tom, &s;queeze and compre&s;s their feet, that they may remain &s;mall and crippled. Yet the&s;e feeble Orientals proceed more rationally in this practice, than their European rivals. <HI>They</HI> begin with it gradually, and from the earlie&s;t infancy. <HI>We</HI> do not think of con|tracting the feet of our children, till they have almo&s;t attained the natural &s;ize, and thus en|deavour to counteract the progre&s;s of Nature, when it is too late to do it with impunity. Who then are the greater &s;laves of fa&s;hion, the Chin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e, or their enlightened antipodes?&mdash;It is pitiable to &s;ee the young and old, of both &s;exes, advancing into an a&s;&s;embly or ball-room, with the mo&s;t painful &s;en&s;ations. Without con&s;ulting Lavater's Phy&s;iognomy, it is ea&s;y to di&s;cover, by their di&s;torted features and compre&s;&s;ed lips, what many whim&s;ical per&s;ons &s;uffer from too tight, or, what is &s;till wor&s;e, from &s;hort &s;hoes. Our knees would be more flexible, and our toes more pliable, more u&s;e|ful, and better adapted to perform the various
<PB N="239" REF="039111_0269_1013A0CF4BD2FE28">
motions of the feet, if they were not contin|ually pre&s;&s;ed and pal&s;ied by this improper <HI>ca&s;e|work.</HI> Nature has de&s;igned the toes to be as moveable as the fingers. Tho&s;e unfortunate beings, who are born without hands, learn to perform with the toes the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing ta&s;ks, to write and cut pens, to &s;ew, to draw; in &s;hort, to &s;upply almo&s;t completely the want of their hands.</P>
<P>Our feet, no doubt, would be more com|fortable, ea&s;y, and u&s;eful, if we were not at the greate&s;t pains to deprive, them of their ela&s;ticity and vigour. The numerous nerves, cro&s;&s;ing the feet in every direction, plainly evince that Nature has endowed them with peculiar powers, of which we can &s;carcely form an adequate conception. The untutor|ed Indian, or the wild African, excels not only the enlightened European, but likewi&s;e the lower animals, in running, leaping, and, in &s;hort, in &s;wiftne&s;s and agility of every kind, where mu&s;cular motion is required. Either of them would heartily laugh at us, when we are obliged to employ profe&s;&s;ional operators for extracting corns, and to contrive oint|ments and pla&s;ters for the cure of tho&s;e evils, which we have wantonly brought on our|&s;elves.</P>
<P>The judicious BUCHAN &s;ays: "Almo&s;t nine tenths of mankind are troubled with corns; a di&s;ea&s;e that is &s;eldom or never occa|&s;ioned but by &s;trait &s;hoes;" and I pre&s;ume to add, that the remaining tenth part do not envy their fellow-creatures for this modern improvement. Our ance&s;tors, even within
<PB N="240" REF="039111_0270_1013A0910B9DB1A0">
my memory, wore their &s;hoes with broad toes, which &s;howed at once their good &s;en&s;e, and due attention to health and comfort. He who is regardle&s;s of the pain and trouble oc|ca&s;ioned by warts, excre&s;cences, and callo&s;ities of various forms; he who wi&s;hes to convert his feet and toes into &s;o many barometers, to indicate the pre&s;ent &s;tate, and to foretel the fu|ture changes of the weather, will ever agree with his &s;hoemaker, to &s;ave as much leather as po&s;&s;ible; and he is &s;carcely to be pitied for his imprudence. Such a per&s;on will not un|frequently be di&s;appointed in his excur&s;ions, when his crippled feet require temporary re&s;t. I am further per&s;uaded, that &s;uch ce&s;&s;ations of exerci&s;e are extremely detrimental to health in general, and that they may be regi&s;tered among the predi&s;po&s;ing cau&s;es of the gout, rheumati&s;m, and drop&s;y. Many people are thus almo&s;t deprived of the u&s;e of their legs; and the pain of the more virulent &s;pecies of corns, as well as of the nails, when grown in|to the fle&s;h, is excruciating.</P>
<P>For the&s;e obvious rea&s;ons, the &s;oles of the &s;hoes ought to be &s;ufficiently broad, e&s;pecially under the toes, where we are accu&s;tomed to &s;ee them &s;o pointed, that they appear to be intended for weapons of attack or defence. If, for in&s;tance, the greate&s;t breadth of the foot be four inches, the &s;hoe &s;hould not be three and a half, but rather four and a half inches broad, &s;ince the bulk of the foot, and the &s;eam of the leather, require an allowance of half an inch. The &s;oles al&s;o ought not to be bent hollow, as is frequently done in wo|men's
<PB N="241" REF="039111_0271_1013A0D0CFB85290">
&s;hoes; for &s;ince the foot is not &s;o con|&s;tructed as to pre&s;ent a &s;pherical &s;urface, it is improper to deprive it of that firm hold, which Nature has given it by a nearly flat form. The foot mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;uffer from this ill-contrived &s;hape, which deprives it of its flexion, occa&s;ions difficulty in walking, and renders every &s;tep unplea&s;ant and un&s;afe.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame manner as &s;ome per&s;ons &s;trange|ly endeavour to dimini&s;h the breadth of the foot, others are equally di&s;&s;atisfied with its length. Hence we &s;ee them make u&s;e of an in&s;trument, to force their feet into &s;hoes per|haps an inch &s;horter than is requi&s;ite for an ea&s;y motion. This cu&s;tom is the mo&s;t de|&s;tructive of any, and, though not much prac|ti&s;ed at pre&s;ent, &s;ince a long and narrow pointed &s;hoe is the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable, yet the inconvenience and danger is not thereby re|moved. In&s;tead of bending the toes with their nails inwards, as was formerly the ca&s;e with &s;hort &s;hoes, we now &s;queeze them to|gether, and often lay them cro&s;sways over one another, &s;o as to carry them about with|out motion, like a mere in&s;en&s;ible ma&s;s of matter. Upon &s;triking the foot again&s;t a &s;tone, we feel the puni&s;hment due to &s;uch outrage. Shoes of this kind may be aptly compared to the wooden boxes worn by the Dutch and French pea&s;ants, from nece&s;&s;ity, in wet &s;ea&s;ons, and which admit of quite as much motion as the long and &s;harp pointed machines, in which our beaux and belles cramp their feed from choice.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="039111_0272_1013A093983386B0">
A convenient &s;hoe, therefore, ought to be &s;omewhat round at the toes, &s;ufficiently long, with thick &s;oles, and the upper leather &s;oft and pliable. If it be deficient in any of the&s;e requi&s;ites, the &s;kin will be rendered callous; the per&s;piration indi&s;pen&s;able to the&s;e parts will be &s;topped; warts and corns will appear in numbers; the nails will grow into the fle&s;h, and various complicated maladies be produced, which not only affect the feet, but the whole body. Be&s;ide the&s;e more &s;erious con&s;equences, a per&s;on walking with narrow &s;hoes will be much &s;ooner and more &s;en&s;ibly fatigued, than he who&s;e &s;hoes are &s;ufficiently wide and ea&s;y.</P>
<P>The poor, as well as country people, who wear &s;hoes &s;ufficiently large, have not only a much &s;afer &s;tep, but their feet are le&s;s &s;ubject to the multiplicity of complaints, with which ours are annoyed. Tho&s;e who, either from inclination or frugality, go barefooted in &s;ummer, have not even to plead the rea&s;on of the Ancients, who con&s;idered it as a mark of cha&s;tity; and I cannot help remarking, that it is both indecorous and unwhole&s;ome, as well as an injudicious &s;pecies of economy. The &s;hoe, in our climate and mode of life, is a nece&s;&s;ary defence again&s;t many accidental in|juries, to which the foot is liable; and it is likewi&s;e a crime again&s;t decency, to expo&s;e any part of the human body to du&s;t and mire.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the <HI>&s;ub&s;tance</HI> of which &s;hoes &s;hould be made, no other general rule can be given, than that it ought to be &s;ufficiently com|pact,
<PB N="243" REF="039111_0273_1013A0D4887901A0">
to prevent the water from penetrating it; &s;o ela&s;tic and &s;oft, as to admit an ea&s;y motion of the whole foot; and accommodated to the weather, exerci&s;e, and &s;oil in which it is u&s;ed. To tho&s;e who have not the means or opportu|nity of procuring the patent water-proof leath|er, I &s;hall &s;ugge&s;t a method of preparing this &s;pecies of leather, at a very &s;mall expen&s;e. One pint of <HI>drying oil,</HI> two ounces of <HI>yellow wax,</HI> two ounces of <HI>&s;pirit of turpentine,</HI> and one ounce of <HI>Burgundy-pitch,</HI> are to be carefully melted together, over a &s;low fire. Tho&s;e to whom the &s;mell of pitch and turpentine is un|plea&s;ant, may add a few drachms of &s;ome cheap e&s;&s;ential oil, as of <HI>lavender, thyme,</HI> and the like. With this compo&s;ition new &s;hoes or boots are rubbed, either in the &s;un, or at &s;ome di&s;tance from a fire, with a &s;ponge or &s;oft bru&s;h: this operation is to be repeated as often as they become dry again, until they be fully &s;aturated. In this manner, the leather at length becomes impervious to wet; the &s;hoes or boots made of it la&s;t much longer than tho&s;e made of common leather, acquire &s;uch &s;oftne&s;s and pliability, that they never &s;hrivel nor grow hard and inflexible, and, thus prepared, are the mo&s;t effectual pre&s;ervatives again&s;t cold and chilblains.</P>
<P>To conclude, I &s;hall only remark, that it is not advi&s;able to change the &s;hoes from one foot to the other. Let us rather tread one of the &s;hoes &s;omewhat crooked, than injure our feet and health, by an adherence to a cu&s;|tom, which has nothing but cu&s;tom to recom|mend it. If it be our &s;erious wi&s;h to avoid
<PB N="244" REF="039111_0274_1013A0975170FB28">
corns and other painful accidents, to which the rage of fa&s;hion &s;ubjects the feet of its vo|taries, we &s;hould per&s;uade the &s;hoe-makers to provide us with a particular &s;hoe for each foot; and this can be done only by keeping <HI>&s;eparate double la&s;ts,</HI> for every wearer. Is it not in|judicious and ab&s;urd, to have both &s;hoes made of the &s;ame &s;ize and form, when Nature has not formed both feet alike, or at lea&s;t not in the &s;ame direction?</P>
<P>It gives me great &s;atisfaction to add, that &s;ince the fir&s;t edition of the&s;e Lectures was publi&s;hed, the rational practice of having &s;ep|arate &s;hoes purpo&s;ely made for each foot, has already been adopted among the more en|lightened cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety. From a full con|viction of its great utility, I &s;incerely wi&s;h that it may &s;oon become univer&s;al!</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of EXERCISE and REST; their occa&s;ional advan|tages and di&s;advatages explained; their manner and limits a&s;certained; together with directions for regulating both.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>MOTION, or bodily exerci&s;e, is nece&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;ervation of health, which is thereby promoted, while the bounds of mod|eration are not exceeded. Too violent exer|ci&s;e, and a total want of it, are attended with equal di&s;advantages. Much al&s;o depends on the kind of motion, and the various po&s;tures of the body.</P>
<P>The e&s;&s;ential advantages of exerci&s;e are the following: bodily &s;trength is increa&s;ed; the circulation of the blood and all other fluids promoted; the nece&s;&s;ary &s;ecretions and ex|cretions are duly performed; the whole ma&s;s of the blood is cleared and refined, &s;o that it cannot &s;tagnate in the minute&s;t capillary ve&s;|&s;els; and if any ob&s;truction &s;hould begin to take place, it will be effectually relieved.</P>
<P>That exerci&s;e is enjoined by nature, we may learn from the whole &s;tructure of the human body, from the number of mu&s;cles formed for motion, and from the mechani&s;m in the circulation of the blood it&s;elf. There are, indeed, no healthier people than tho&s;e who have continual &s;trong exerci&s;e. Man in a &s;tate of health is in&s;tinctively induced to mu&s;cular exertion; and children that are per|fectly
<PB N="246" REF="039111_0276_1013A098D7513918">
healthy are con&s;tantly running about, and in almo&s;t uninterrupted motion.</P>
<P>But if exerci&s;e, either by its violence, or too long duration, exceed the proper limits, it nat|urally quickens both re&s;piration and the circu|lation of the blood, which may occa&s;ion the bur&s;ting of &s;mall blood-ve&s;&s;els, mi&s;carriages, in|flammations, and collections of blood towards certain parts of the body, &s;uch as the heart and the brain. The &s;aline acrimony of the fluids is thus more di&s;engaged; the fat is di&s;|&s;olved; and inflammatory fevers, hemorrha|ges, and pal&s;ies, may be the con&s;equences.</P>
<P>Violent exerci&s;e is particularly hurtful to tho&s;e who are unaccu&s;tomed to it, or who have committed exce&s;&s;es in drinking, and, what is &s;till wor&s;e, in eating more than is nec|e&s;&s;ary: and tho&s;e who&s;e bodies have not been &s;ufficiently nouri&s;hed by food and drink, may al&s;o be injured by too much exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;udden tran&s;ition from a &s;tate of re&s;t, to violent action, is likewi&s;e hurtful, and &s;till more &s;o in hot than in cold weather. After &s;trong emotions of the mind, every &s;pecies of bodily exerci&s;e ought to be avoided, till the tranquillity of mind return with the re&s;t of the body; yet we ought to guard again&s;t the effects of cold, as it may prove extremely prejudicial in &s;uch a &s;tate.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="039111_0277_1013A0D9C10A7EA8">
WITH re&s;pect to the manner of taking ex|erci&s;e, three principal points are to be attend|ed to:</P>
<P N="1">1. As to the <HI>kind</HI> of exerci&s;e,&mdash;the various &s;pecies of which may be aptly divided into <HI>active</HI> and <HI>pa&s;&s;ive.</HI> The active are of a very diver&s;ified nature; <HI>walking, running, leaping, &s;wimming, riding, fencing,</HI> the <HI>military exerci&s;e,</HI> different &s;orts of <HI>athletic games,</HI> as well as every other kind that requires mu&s;cular exertion.&mdash;<HI>Pa&s;&s;ive</HI> exerci&s;e compri&s;es <HI>riding</HI> in a carriage, <HI>&s;ailing, friction, &s;winging,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The more active &s;pecies of exerci&s;e are ben|eficial to youth, to tho&s;e of a middle age, to the robu&s;t in general, and particularly to the corpulent, the plethoric, and tho&s;e who&s;e evacuations are not in due proportion to their &s;upplies. The pa&s;&s;ive kinds of exerci&s;e, on the contrary, are better &s;uited to infants, to old, dry, and emaciated per&s;ons, to the deli|cate and debilitated, and particularly to the a&s;thmatic and con&s;umptive.</P>
<P N="2">2. As to the <HI>time</HI> in which exerci&s;e is mo&s;t proper to be taken&mdash;this depends on &s;o great a variety of concurrent circum&s;tances, that the rules by which it may be regulated, can|not be univer&s;al, and mu&s;t therefore be col|lected from the preceding ob&s;ervations on the properties and effects of Air, Food, Drink, and &s;o forth. Other particulars, &s;uch as re|late to greater or le&s;s degrees of fatigue attend|ing the different &s;pecies of exerci&s;e, and the utility of it, in certain &s;tates of the mind and body, mu&s;t determine this, as well as</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="248" REF="039111_0278_1013A09C6F190990">
3. The <HI>duration</HI> of it;&mdash;for it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to lay down po&s;itive rules, how long every individual, in every particular &s;it|uation, may continue a certain &s;pecies of ex|erci&s;e, &s;o as to derive advantage. The&s;e rules, as far as they can be e&s;tabli&s;hed, may be col|lected from the &s;ub&s;equent remarks, and then applied to the particular kinds of exerci&s;e, by which we may be benefited in different ca&s;es and &s;ituations.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary fir&s;t to ob&s;erve, that any kind of exerci&s;e which we are accu&s;tomed to take, with a view to brace the body, is far prefera|ble to an unu&s;ual one, which may be attended with a contrary effect. We ought always to begin gently, and to fini&s;h gradually, never abruptly. Exerci&s;e in the open air has great advantages over that in hou&s;es and clo&s;e apart|ments. Be&s;ides, &s;trong bodily exertions, &s;uch as dancing, fencing, turning, and the like, if practi&s;ed in &s;mall and confined places, on ac|count of the increa&s;ed per&s;piration, &s;oon vi|tiate the air, and render it unfit for breathing.</P>
<P>If we take exerci&s;e for the &s;ake of health, we ought to employ our&s;elves during that time with &s;ome agreeable object, and not per|form any labour nor &s;eriou&s;ly occupy the mind. Hence certain kinds of exerci&s;e cannot be un|conditionally recommended to every individ|ual, as means conducive to health; though they &s;hould of them&s;elves be proper, and in other re&s;pects agree with the con&s;titu|tion. He who forces him&s;elf to any exerci&s;e, or performs it with reluctance, will thence de|rive more injury than benefit: motions or
<PB N="249" REF="039111_0279_1013A0DC564A5C20">
ta&s;ks, therefore, which we impo&s;e upon our|&s;elves, as recreations after work, or after &s;it|ting and long thinking, ought to be &s;trictly relaxations, not toil&s;ome exertions.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons of an active mind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ind a &s;pecies of relaxation, and even &s;atisfaction, in a change of their pur&s;uits, and particularly in the tran|&s;ition from hard and difficult, to more plea&s;|ant and ea&s;y avocations. To &s;uch individu|als any exerci&s;e is frequently of great advan|tage, e&s;pecially if it an&s;wer, or appear to them to be conducive to any u&s;eful purpo&s;e. To one who has habituated him&s;elf to grave and &s;erious pur&s;uits, it &s;hould not be recommend|ed to join in amu&s;ements requiring bodily ex|ertion, and attended with di&s;&s;atisfaction and irk&s;omene&s;s; for his health will not be im|proved by exerci&s;e, at once unu&s;ual and un|plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>To continue exerci&s;e until a profu&s;e per&s;pi|ration, or a great la&s;&s;itude, take place, cannot be whole&s;ome. In the forenoon, when the &s;tomach is empty, or at lea&s;t, not too much di&s;tended, mu&s;cular motion is both mo&s;t agree|able and healthful; it &s;tregthens dige&s;tion, and heats the body le&s;s than with a full &s;tom|ach. A good appetite after it, is a proof that it has not been carried to exce&s;s. But it is not advi&s;able to take violent exerci&s;e imme|diately before a meal; as this might occa|&s;ion a deficiency of tho&s;e humours, which are nece&s;&s;ary to promote dige&s;tion. If we &s;it down to a &s;ub&s;tantial dinner or &s;upper, imme|diately after a fatiguing walk, when the blood is heated, and the body is in a &s;tate of per&s;pi|ration,
<PB N="250" REF="039111_0280_1013A09F0B78FB30">
the wor&s;t con&s;equences may en&s;ue, e&s;|pecially if we begin with the mo&s;t cooling di&s;hes, or with &s;alad, or a gla&s;s of cold drink.</P>
<P>Exerci&s;e is likewi&s;e hurtful directly after meals; &s;ince it ob&s;tructs dige&s;tion, and pro|pels tho&s;e fluids too much to the &s;urface of the body, which are de&s;igned for the &s;tom|ach, to promote the &s;olution of food, and without which many crude and undige&s;ted particles are forced to enter, and to mix with the blood. The old rule of the <HI>Salernitan School, "Po&s;t coenam &s;tabis, &s;eu pa&s;&s;us mille mea|bis,"</HI> (i. e. after &s;upper &s;tand, or walk a mile) is as frivolous as it is ab&s;urd; for experience &s;ufficiently informs us, that mo&s;t per&s;ons, par|ticularly the nervous and irritable, are liable to the heartburn, eructations, and even vom|iting, when they are obliged to move about or to take any exerci&s;e immediately after meals. The in&s;tinct of the lower animals al|&s;o contradicts this rule; becau&s;e the wilde&s;t creatures are inclined to re&s;t after food.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons who are under the nece&s;&s;ity of mov|ing immediately after their meals, or who have no other &s;pare time for walking, mu&s;t endeavour to overcome the&s;e inconveniencies by cu&s;tom, and a more rigid temperance: they &s;hould fir&s;t take the mo&s;t gentle kind of exerci&s;e, and gradually increa&s;e it; and, as the late hours of dining, now &s;o generally in fa&s;hion, have in a manner aboli&s;hed heavy &s;uppers, a moderate walk after a &s;light even|ing's repa&s;t cannot be injurious. But at all events, fatiguing exerci&s;e, after a full meal, &s;hould be delayed till the &s;tomach has dige&s;t|ed
<PB N="251" REF="039111_0281_1013A0DF2705AB78">
and a&s;&s;imilated the food, which generally takes place in the third or fourth hour after eating. The mo&s;t proper occupations after dinner, are &s;uch as can be performed without trouble, or great efforts of reflection and bod|ily exertion, and &s;uch as afford a kind of amu&s;ement.</P>
<P><HI>Walking,</HI> the mo&s;t &s;alutary and natural ex|erci&s;e, is in the power of every body; and we can adapt its degree and duration to the various circum&s;tances of health. By this ex|erci&s;e, the appetite and per&s;piration are pro|moted; the body is kept in a proper temper|ament; the mind is enlivened; the motion of the lungs is facilitated; and the rigidity and contraction of the legs, ari&s;ing from too much fitting, is relieved. The mo&s;t ob&s;tinate di&s;ea&s;es, and the mo&s;t trouble&s;ome hy&s;teric and hypochondriacal complaints, have been frequently cured by per&s;everance in walking.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t proper walk for health, is in an agreeable country, in a healthy, pure, dry air, amid&s;t &s;ocial and cheerful conver&s;ations, in a mild &s;un&s;hiny day, whether in &s;pring, autumn or winter; in the &s;ummer mornings and af|ternoons, but by no means in the oppre&s;&s;ive heat of the &s;un. To walk in towns, although it gives exerci&s;e, is le&s;s conducive to health; becau&s;e the atmo&s;phere is generally filled with vapours ari&s;ing from impure exhalations.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are not hardened again&s;t the vi|ci&s;&s;itudes of the weather, mu&s;t avoid not on|ly hail and rain, but al&s;o the cold mornings and evenings, and ought, therefore, in rough and moi&s;t cold weather, rather to take exerci&s;e
<PB N="252" REF="039111_0282_1013A0A0942F53F0">
within the hou&s;e, but without preventing the acce&s;s of air. Violent wind &s;hould al&s;o be avoided; and if we are obliged to face it, we ought not to walk too fa&s;t, particularly in winter, when the &s;mall pores of the &s;kin are compre&s;&s;ed by the air.</P>
<P>In walking, the proper choice of places is a matter of much importance. Mar&s;hy and damp fields &s;hould be avoided; and in au|tumn, when the foliage is decaying, it is not advi&s;able to choo&s;e woods, groves, and damp meadows, for our plea&s;ure-walks. In &s;um|mer, on the contrary, a walk in the fore&s;ts or meadows is both agreeable and healthful. Hills and elevated &s;ituations de&s;erve particu|larly to be vi&s;ited, not only on account of the purer air we breathe, but al&s;o of the body en|joying a variety of exerci&s;e, in a&s;cending and de&s;cending.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of towns require longer walks for the pre&s;ervation of their health than country people. The latter, even with le&s;s exerci&s;e, derive vigour of body and &s;erenity of mind, from a purer air, and more &s;imple manners. Regular and daily walking, there|fore, cannot be too much recommended to the citizen, who in the pre&s;ent age is &s;o much hara&s;&s;ed with nervous and hypochondriacal complaints; but, though this be an u&s;eful and excellent &s;pecies of exerci&s;e, yet &s;ome rules ought to be ob&s;erved, if we expect to derive from it the wi&s;hed-for advantages.</P>
<P N="1">1. We &s;hould contrive to procure as much plea&s;ure and recreation after &s;erious occupa|tions,
<PB N="253" REF="039111_0283_1013A0E2F33D9978">
as is po&s;&s;ible and con&s;i&s;tent with our &s;it|uation in life.</P>
<P N="2">2. To read during a walk, whether the &s;ubject be of a grave or amu&s;ing nature, is a cu&s;tom improper in it&s;elf, and detrimental to the eyes, be&s;ides the danger it occa&s;ions of falling: this practice not only deprives a per|&s;on of the principal advantages of a walk, but people ea&s;ily accu&s;tom them&s;elves to an un&s;afe and ungraceful manner of carrying the body. It is attended with the wor&s;t con&s;equences to the eyes, becau&s;e the focus is continually &s;hift|ed, and the retina is thus exce&s;&s;ively fatigued.</P>
<P N="3">3. We &s;hould not frequent the &s;ame, per|haps often a dull and unvaried walk, though mo&s;t convenient. It is better to change the walk occa&s;ionally, and gradually to extend the di&s;tance. The mo&s;t agreeable pro&s;pects &s;hould be cho&s;en for variety; otherwi&s;e the perpet|ually uniform walk will excite melancholy and unplea&s;ant &s;en&s;ations, as much as the clo&s;et or the &s;tudy.</P>
<P N="4">4. We ought to accu&s;tom our&s;elves to a &s;teady and regular, but not a quick pace.</P>
<P N="5">5. An agreeable companion contributes much to &s;erenity of mind: but let us rather go alone, than in dull or frivolous compa|ny, if we at all po&s;&s;e&s;s the art of profiting by &s;olitude.</P>
<P N="6">6. In the choice of our companions, we &s;hould attend not only to congeniality of character and ta&s;te, but &s;hould al&s;o, in this exerci&s;e, a&s;&s;ociate with tho&s;e who&s;e pace ac|cords with ours; for if the heavy and corpu|lent man make a lean and light-footed per&s;on
<PB N="254" REF="039111_0284_1013A0A4299222B8">
the companion of his walks, he will remain behind, or be overheated and fatigued, if he endeavour to keep pace with his partner, who mu&s;t likewi&s;e &s;uffer from the con&s;traint of &s;lower motion.</P>
<P N="7">7. Some people cannot &s;peak or conver&s;e in walking, without frequent &s;tops, and thus make little progre&s;s. From this &s;ingularity, they are generally much fatigued at their re|turn, without having reaped any benefit from their exerci&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Running</HI> not only &s;hakes the body with greater violence than walking, but it heats the head and face, and too much quickens the circulation of the fluids. Soon after a meal, it prevents dige&s;tion, mixes the pure fluids with the impure, and ob&s;tructs the &s;ecretion of humours. If long continued, it is hurtful to every one, particularly to tho&s;e unaccu&s;|tomed to it, to the plethoric, to tho&s;e &s;ubject to hemorrhages, gravelly complaints, and fre|quent nervous head-ach, and to &s;edentary per|&s;ons employed in mental labour. To run up a hill, too much fatigues and &s;trains the mu&s;|cles; and to run again&s;t the wind, produces giddine&s;s in the mo&s;t robu&s;t, and makes them liable to various accidents, that may be at|tended with danger.</P>
<P><HI>Dancing,</HI> con&s;idered in it&s;elf, and under proper limitations, is an admirable exerci&s;e, e&s;pecially in winter, when the heavy atmo&s;|phere, much re&s;t, and &s;itting, render the blood thick, and di&s;po&s;e per&s;ons to hypochondria&s;is. Moderate dances have every advantage of a gentle exerci&s;e, be&s;ides the beneficial effects
<PB N="255" REF="039111_0285_10136E2C13C62DF8">
produced on the mind by cheerful company and mu&s;ic. On the other hand, the more vi|olent dances may be, and frequently are, at|tended with the mo&s;t pernicious effects. The exertion of &s;o many mu&s;cles, the quick in|&s;piration of a warm atmo&s;phere in a crowded a&s;&s;embly, impel the blood to circulate with a rapidity equal to that in the hot &s;tage of a fe|ver, and propel it to the head and brea&s;t, &s;o that the ve&s;&s;els &s;eldom po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;ufficient pow|er of re&s;i&s;tance. If we add to this, the effect of heating liquors, of too &s;udden an acce&s;s of the cold air, &s;o eagerly, courted, of expo&s;ing the face, head and brea&s;t, &s;uddenly to its in|fluence, together with the imprudent u&s;e of cooling drink, and ice it&s;elf, we can no longer be &s;urpri&s;ed, that &s;pitting of blood, con&s;ump|tion of the lungs, and inflammatory di&s;or|ders, are the frequent con&s;equences of &s;uch exce&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>This violent &s;pecies of exerci&s;e is particu|larly dangerous to females; and the u&s;e of fans, in order to cool them&s;elves, and thus check per&s;piration, (which is wi&s;ely de&s;igned by nature to produce the &s;ame effect, in a more &s;alutary degree, if not wantonly repel|led) is extremely imprudent. Delicate per|&s;ons ought, for their own &s;akes, to join in no other but the &s;horter and le&s;s fatiguing dances, e&s;pecially in &s;ummer.</P>
<P>A dancing-room ought to be cool, but without admitting currents of air, and with|out too much &s;moke from candles. It would be advi&s;able for the whole company, after dancing is over, and before they venture into
<PB N="256" REF="039111_0286_1013A0A5AFC86430">
the open air, to change their linen, and after|wards to wait a quarter or half an hour be|fore they return home. During that time, they may be refre&s;hed by tea, and thus en|counter the open air without danger. Every dancing a&s;&s;embly ought to conclude with min|uets. Per&s;ons of an indi&s;po&s;ed and debili|tated body, &s;uch as the con&s;umptive, tho&s;e troubled with ruptures, gravelly and &s;imilar complaints, &s;hould not attempt to dance. La&s;tly, this exerci&s;e is hurtful to every per&s;on in the hot and &s;ultry days of &s;ummer, when nature renders cooling drink indi&s;pen&s;able, and when we are much inclined to per&s;pire, without any additional inducement.</P>
<P><HI>Riding in carriages</HI> is an exerci&s;e the more conducive to health, that the gentle jolts tend to re&s;olve &s;tagnations in the inte&s;tines of hy|pochondriacs, corpulent people, convale&s;cents, and the con&s;umptive. But, if the motion of the carriage be too rapid, it is hurtful, as it not only accelerates per&s;piration before the matter of it is properly prepared, but al&s;o in|jures the &s;olid parts, e&s;pecially the kidneys, generates conge&s;tions of the blood towards the head, and con&s;equently head-ach, giddine&s;s, vomiting, and ob&s;tructions. If, however, we wi&s;h to derive all the good effects from riding in a carriage, the body of it ought not to be too nicely &s;u&s;pended in &s;traps and &s;prings, nor &s;hould the motion be too &s;low. One of the windows, at lea&s;t, ought to be kept open, that the per&s;piration and breath of &s;everal per&s;ons, inclo&s;ed in &s;o narrow a place, may not too much vitiate the air.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="039111_0287_1013A0E70D5698B8">
The infirm, who cannot enjoy the free air in bad weather, &s;hould take exerci&s;e upon rocking hor&s;es, or &s;imilar contrivances, in halls and &s;pacious apartments, while the upper part of the windows is kept open, guarding, how|ever, again&s;t a current of air. La&s;tly, the fu|rious driving in open carriages, in &s;ultry weather, may be indeed plea&s;ant, on account of the agreeable current of air; but it may al&s;o become dangerous to per&s;ons &s;ubject to violent per&s;piration.</P>
<P><HI>Leaping, fencing,</HI> the fa&s;hionable <HI>military ex|erci&s;e,</HI> and <HI>manoeuvring with hor&s;es,</HI> are violent kinds of exerci&s;e, which cannot be recom|mended to tho&s;e who are not in a perfect &s;tate of health, or to the corpulent and ple|thoric, who&s;e blood-ve&s;&s;els may be &s;o over|&s;trained as to bur&s;t, by motions which require the mu&s;cular exertion of the whole body.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e who are otherwi&s;e healthy, but cannot afford to take &s;ufficient exerci&s;e, either by their particular &s;ituation in life, or from want of time, I would recommend a <HI>new</HI> &s;pe|cies, which; in its &s;alutary effects <HI>on the whole body,</HI> is equal if not &s;uperior to any other. It &s;imply con&s;i&s;ts in moving the whole body, in the middle of a room, (and, if convenient, with open windows) and let the operator, while he inclines forward upon his toes, rai&s;e his arms, and drop them with the alternate motion backward on his heels. Thus the <HI>whole</HI> mu&s;cular &s;y&s;tem will be duly exerci&s;ed, without confining the motion to one partic|ular part. This is even preferable to the <HI>dumb-bells,</HI> which, like every other &s;pecies of
<PB N="258" REF="039111_0288_1013A0A84BDB1090">
<HI>partial</HI> exerci&s;e, if per&s;evered in, are &s;o far ob|jectionable, as they require the uncommon exertion of certain mu&s;cles, while the due and uniform circulation of the blood to tho&s;e parts is di&s;turbed, to the detriment of others which are at re&s;t.</P>
<P>To per&s;ons who are deprived of the u&s;e of their limbs, and are weak and delicate, the motion of a &s;edan chair is of great benefit, if it be continued for a &s;ufficient time; for it di&s;po&s;es the body to a free per&s;piration. Of the &s;ame nature is the failing in barges or boats, either on lakes or rivers.</P>
<P>A much more active kind of bodily mo|tion is produced by &s;hort voyages at &s;ea. Tho&s;e who are unaccu&s;tomed to it, generally experience giddine&s;s of the head, nau&s;ea, and vomiting: hence it is beneficial to an impure &s;tomach. To con&s;umptive patients it fre|quently is the la&s;t re&s;ource; but it is wrong to delay it, till all other remedies have failed. For it is not in the la&s;t &s;tage of con&s;umption, when the lungs are already ulcerated, or when an ab&s;ce&s;s has already bur&s;t in the thorax, and the ichorous matter has been communicated to the blood, that we can expect any benefit from voyages. The changes of &s;cene and climate, indeed, powerfully co-operate in ef|fecting changes in the human &s;y&s;tem; but, if the di&s;ea&s;e has preyed too much on the vitals of a patient, or if he is &s;pitting blood, the motion of the ve&s;&s;el mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily prove injurious. On the other hand, the debilitat|ed, the nervous, and particularly the hypo|chondriac,
<PB N="259" REF="039111_0289_1013A0EAB6C2AD40">
cannot re&s;ort to a better remedy than a &s;hort voyage.</P>
<P><HI>Riding on hor&s;eback</HI> is, in a certain re&s;pect, an excellent medical remedy, by which all the mu&s;cles, from the toes to the head, are in re|ciprocal motion, and which manife&s;ts its prin|cipal effects on the inte&s;tines of the abdomen. It clears the inte&s;tinal canal, promotes the evacuation of crude &s;ub&s;tances, &s;trengthens the &s;tomach and bowels, improves dige&s;tion, prevents or re&s;olves incipient ob&s;tructions, and facilitates the per&s;piration of the whole body. To the hypochondriac it is an ine&s;ti|mable remedy; but, if the ob&s;tructions &s;hould be too far advanced, riding ought either not to be attempted at all, or practi&s;ed in as &s;low a pace as the hor&s;e can walk. In &s;hort, it is to be undertaken with the &s;ame precaution as &s;ailing, in tho&s;e &s;tages of con&s;umption which admit of the&s;e remedies.</P>
<P>Farther, riding is not advi&s;able in ca&s;es of hemorrhoids, ruptures, and gravel. The fee|ble and relaxed ought to begin with a gentle pace, and to increa&s;e it gradually; for a mod|erate trot is the proper medicinal mode of riding: and, if they expect to derive real ad|vantage from riding on hor&s;eback, they mu&s;t neither trot too fa&s;t, nor make u&s;e of a heavy and jolting hor&s;e. Such patients as are unac|cu&s;tomed to this exerci&s;e, particularly hypo|chondriacs, generally ride with great timidity. Their lives are, as it were, in continual dan|ger; by the awkward po&s;ture of their bodies on hor&s;eback, they are frequently hurt in parts acce&s;&s;ible to injuries; &s;titches in the
<PB N="260" REF="039111_0290_1013A0AC3B15BB80">
&s;ide, conge&s;tions of blood in the head, and vi|olent per&s;piration, counterbalance every ad|vantage received from their excur&s;ions. To mo&s;t of the&s;e patients, if they can afford it, the riding-&s;chool cannot fail to be extremely u&s;eful; for the regular manner of training the hor&s;es there, their uniform and &s;teady motion, the attention paid to the proper po&s;|ture of the rider, by keeping his brea&s;t and abdomen erect, and the legs properly extend|ed; all are circum&s;tances very favourable to the patient and convale&s;cent. But, even here, it is the moderate kind of exerci&s;e only, that promi&s;es real benefit in a medicinal &s;en&s;e;&mdash;continued furious driving and hard trotting are always extremely dangerous.</P>
<P>For &s;imilar rea&s;ons, riding on hor&s;eback, as well as in carriages, immediately after a meal, is &s;till more dangerous than walking. The mo&s;t proper time for riding is the morning, when the &s;tomach is empty. It &s;hould, how|ever, not be long continued; one hour, in general, is quite &s;ufficient; and in this re&s;pect, riding is preferable to any other exerci&s;e, as it can be practi&s;ed by per&s;ons, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s does not permit them to devote much of their time to that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Swimming</HI> is likewi&s;e an u&s;eful exerci&s;e, which at the &s;ame time has the additional ad|vantage of a cold bath. The motions and mu&s;cular exertions, which it requires, increa&s;e its utility: &s;ome rules and precautions, how|ever, mu&s;t be attended to. They have been &s;tated at con&s;iderable length in CHAP. III. "On the u&s;e of Baths." I &s;hall, therefore,
<PB N="261" REF="039111_0291_1013A0ED55307428">
at pre&s;ent only remark, that we &s;hould not enter with the feet, but with the head, into a cold bath; that the body &s;hould be neither too warm nor too cold in applying this bath; and that we &s;hould not choo&s;e dangerous riv|ers, or ponds, nor enter the water before the rays of the &s;un have in &s;ome degree warmed it, and rendered it more temperate. The &s;en|&s;ation produced by cold water is indeed le&s;s to be apprehended, than the con&s;equences ari&s;ing from imprudently plunging into it, when the body is either too much cooled or heated.</P>
<P><HI>Playing</HI> at <HI>Hand-ball, Cricket,</HI> and the like, have a more powerful effect on the mu&s;cles than the abdomen; and are therefore, in one re&s;pect, unavailing to &s;edentary people, and on the other hand unnece&s;&s;arily fatiguing. <HI>Carou&s;&s;els,</HI> or riding on machines in a circle, are movements which require too much mu&s;|cular exertion of the debilitated, who&s;e &s;trength admits only of a moderate exerci&s;e. The&s;e, as well as <HI>&s;winging machines,</HI> and the lately contrived <HI>&s;winging cars,</HI> moving on a wheel with perpendicular pivots, are the lea&s;t proper for tho&s;e who are inclined to giddi|ne&s;s, and nervous &s;ymptoms in general, on account of the fear, and &s;ometimes the dan|gerous accidents attending them. But, at the &s;ame time, both &s;pecies of exerci&s;e are ex|tremely favourable in &s;uch &s;tates of health, as require an uniform and gentle motion of the whole body, in the pure and open air, particularly in the high &s;winging cars, which are well calculated for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="039111_0292_1013A0ADC483C6E8">
<HI>Speaking,</HI> is one of the mo&s;t healthful and nece&s;&s;ary &s;pecies of exerci&s;e; and, without any ludicrous idea, I may a&s;&s;ert, that this practice, is particularly &s;alutary to the female &s;ex, who are more confined at home than men. Here, however, as in other ca&s;es, ex|ce&s;s is prejudicial. Loud reading and &s;peak|ing are of &s;ingular advantage to literary men, affording them good &s;ub&s;titutes for other kinds of exerci&s;e, for which they &s;eldom have &s;uf|ficient lei&s;ure or opportunities. It is to this cau&s;e we may ju&s;tly a&s;cribe the longevity of many &s;choolma&s;ters, and teachers in univer|&s;ities, who, notwith&s;tanding their &s;edentary employments, and the vitiated air which they daily breathe in &s;chool-rooms, attain to a long and healthy life. To &s;peak very loud, and to exerci&s;e the voice immediately after a meal, is pernicious to the lungs, as well as to the organs of dige&s;tion.</P>
<P><HI>Singing</HI> promotes the lively circulation of the blood through the lungs, and all parts of the body; the lungs, as well as the abdominal inte&s;tines, are &s;haken by the vibrating motion of the air, in a manner very conducive to their &s;alubrity. The phlegm, and other nox|ious matter, collected about the pulmonary ve&s;&s;els, are thereby re&s;olved and carried away, &s;o that they cannot mix with the blood, and the mo&s;t dangerous &s;tagnations in the &s;maller ve&s;&s;els are thus prevented: the blood is uni|formly di&s;tributed and driven to the larger veins and arteries. For the &s;ame law of na|ture, by which river-water is pre&s;erved &s;weet and fre&s;h, while that of pools and ditches &s;tag|nates
<PB N="263" REF="039111_0293_1013A0EEDAF876F8">
and putrifies, is al&s;o fully applicable here. The air inhaled in &s;inging is of &s;imilar &s;ervice to us, as the current to the water: per&s;piration is thereby promoted, and the mind is enlivened with the body. Tho&s;e &s;edentary artificers or mechanics, who from habit almo&s;t con&s;tantly &s;ing at their work, unintentionally contribute much to the pre&s;|ervation of their health.</P>
<P>All <HI>Wind In&s;truments</HI> are more or le&s;s hurt|ful; for, as much air is thereby introduced into the lungs, and as it is but gradually and partially emitted, that organ &s;oon becomes debilitated. Hence per&s;ons of weak lungs, who are very fond of playing the flute, haut|boy, or French horn, are frequently afflicted with &s;pitting of blood, cough, &s;hortne&s;s of breath, and pulmonary con&s;umption. Be|&s;ides, blowing checks the circulation of the blood through the lungs, accumulates it to|wards the head, and di&s;po&s;es &s;uch mu&s;icians to apoplexy. By the violent expul&s;ion of the air, the abdominal mu&s;cles are contracted, all the parts of the abdomen are compre&s;&s;ed, the circulation of the fluids is retarded, and many unplea&s;ant and frequently fatal con&s;equences are induced.</P>
<P>There are other kinds of <HI>mu&s;ical in&s;truments,</HI> which, in a dietetical view, de&s;erve to be con|demned. Such is the <HI>Harmonica,</HI> which, by the rotation of the gla&s;&s;es on the &s;ingers, (a kind of negative electricity) induces a great degree of nervous weakne&s;s. And this effect is much accelerated by the acute and vibrat|ing &s;ounds of this in&s;trument, by which the
<PB N="264" REF="039111_0294_1013A0B04E045548">
organs of hearing are inten&s;ely affected. Per|haps all &s;tringed in&s;truments, which are play|ed by the touch of the fingers, &s;uch as the harp, the guitar, and the violin, produce a &s;imilar effect on the nervous &s;y&s;tem; e&s;pe|cially if it be true, that the <HI>papillae,</HI> or the points of the fingers, are the &s;tronge&s;t con|ductors of the &s;uppo&s;ed nervous fluid. It is at lea&s;t probable, that to be able to play on &s;uch in&s;truments, with expre&s;&s;ion, requires a more than common &s;en&s;ibility of the nerves, which indeed may be &s;ometimes artificially acquired, but to the detriment of health. For it cannot be doubted, that a local excite|ment of irritability may be gradually propa|gated over the whole nervous &s;y&s;tem; and that, from rai&s;ing &s;ome parts of the body to a preternatural &s;tate of &s;en&s;ibility, the common character of tho&s;e who are called <HI>Virtuo&s;i,</HI> is generally marked with nervous debility. Ev|ery body knows in how extraordinary a man|ner mu&s;ic may influence the mind; that the pa&s;&s;ions of per&s;ons of &s;en&s;ibility may be mo&s;t effectually rou&s;ed and allayed by it; nay, that in &s;ome individuals, every feeling of the mind can be affected at plea&s;ure, by the various mod|ifications of harmony. As, therefore, &s;adne&s;s, grief, and other depre&s;&s;ing pa&s;&s;ions, may be alleviated by appropriate mu&s;ic, it is an exer|ci&s;e de&s;erving every commendation. Yet we mu&s;t neither expect to cure by it di&s;ea&s;es of the mind, nor their concomitant bodily di&s;or|ders: this is beyond the power of mu&s;ic, which acts as a palliative only, or as a nerv|ous &s;timulus, the effect of which is in&s;tanta|neous,
<PB N="265" REF="039111_0295_1013A0F166E0DD98">
but of &s;hort duration. For, as &s;oon as the exciting cau&s;e cea&s;es, it is &s;ucceeded by an uncomfortable &s;en&s;ation of debility and re|laxation. It is even probable, that mu&s;ic, like all other anodyne and &s;oothing remedies, may in the end increa&s;e the di&s;po&s;ition to nervous weakne&s;s, by its too frequent repetition.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, the po&s;ture of the body, in practi&s;|ing mu&s;ic, al&s;o de&s;erves attention; as the brea&s;t and abdomen may be compre&s;&s;ed by &s;tooping, &s;o as to cau&s;e very &s;erious com|plaints; and as the eyes may be injured by reading the notes, at too great or &s;hort a di&s;|tance, e&s;pecially for the double keys of the harp and harp&s;ichord: indeed, reading mu&s;ic is in general more fatiguing to the eyes, than any other kind of exertion.</P>
<P><HI>Friction</HI> of the body, which can be perform|ed either by the naked hand, a piece of flan|nel, or &s;till better by a fle&s;h-bru&s;h, is one of the mo&s;t gentle and u&s;eful &s;pecies of exerci&s;e. The whole body may be &s;ubjected to this mild operation, but principally the abdomen, the &s;pine, the arms, and legs. It clears the &s;kin, re&s;olves &s;tagnating humours, promotes per|&s;piration, &s;trengthens the fibres, and increa&s;es the warmth and energy of the whole &s;y&s;tem. In rheumati&s;m, gout, pal&s;y, and green-&s;ick|ne&s;s, it is an excellent remedy.</P>
<P>Daily friction of the whole body was with the ancients, and &s;till is in the Ea&s;t Indies, con&s;idered one of the mo&s;t indi&s;pen&s;able requi|&s;ites of a people, who by their indolent man|ner of life &s;eem to have adopted it, more with a view of indulging in &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures, than
<PB N="266" REF="039111_0296_1013A0B1D7046908">
as the means of pre&s;erving health. It is, how|ever, one of the mo&s;t &s;alutary expedients, by which the whole body receives nearly as much benefit as from a tepid bath, and which, as being in the power of every per&s;on, ought to be more frequently and more generally u&s;ed. To the &s;edentary, the hypochondriac, and per&s;ons troubled with indige&s;tion, who cannot afford lei&s;ure to take &s;ufficient exer|ci&s;e, the daily friction of the belly, in particu|lar, cannot be too much recommended as a &s;ub&s;titute for other means, in order to di&s;|&s;olve pituitous &s;tagnations, which may be forming in the abdomen, and to re-invigorate the ve&s;&s;els. And though it be not attended with all the advantages enjoyed from exerci&s;e in the open air, it &s;till produces a powerful effect on the organs of dige&s;tion; for the moderate exerci&s;e of a whole day will &s;carcely invigorate the abdominal ve&s;&s;els, and particu|larly the &s;tomach, &s;o much as the friction of the&s;e parts, continued for half an hour. But, if it be intended for the&s;e beneficial purpo&s;es, it &s;hould be performed in the morning, on an empty &s;tomach, or in bed before we ri&s;e, gently and &s;teadily, in a circular direction, and at lea&s;t for five or ten minutes at a time.</P>
<P>In a weak &s;tate of the abdomen, and the nerves in general, we may derive &s;till more &s;alutary effects from friction, if the &s;tomach and the whole abdomen be rubbed every morning, and at night, before going to bed, with a &s;ponge, or a piece of flannel dipped in cold water. This po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;till greater advan|tages over internal medicines, becau&s;e it can
<PB N="267" REF="039111_0297_1013A0F521BB2D78">
be &s;afely employed, even in ca&s;es where the alimentary canal, from its ob&s;tructed &s;tate, &s;carcely admits of any other remedies, while friction, and the affu&s;ion of cold water, gen|erally relieve the&s;e ob&s;tructions, and even habitual co&s;tivene&s;s.</P>
<P>Motion or exerci&s;e ought to be continued only till we feel an agreeable la&s;&s;itude, and a &s;en&s;ible degree of per&s;piration. If it be car|ried farther, it weakens in&s;tead of &s;trength|ening the body, and leaves behind di&s;agreea|ble con&s;equences to the lungs, filled with heated blood. Even the robu&s;t man will ex|perience &s;ome, though le&s;s unplea&s;ant effects than the debilitated, if he has committed an exce&s;s of this nature.</P>
<P>After having taken exerci&s;e, we &s;hould not venture to re&s;t in a cool place, nor upon a green plot; &s;till le&s;s &s;hould we expo&s;e our&s;elves to a current of air; but rather frequent a place warmed by the mild rays of the &s;un in &s;ummer, or a moderately warm apartment in winter, &s;o that the &s;udden change of temper|ature may not injure us, by &s;uppre&s;&s;ing per|&s;piration.</P>
<P>For the &s;ame rea&s;ons, the thir&s;t we gener|ally feel after exerci&s;e, ought not to be in|&s;tantly &s;atisfied by cooling drink. It is how|ever allowable to drink &s;ome warm or diluent liquors, if we cannot wait till the natural warmth be re&s;tored. The late Dr. Fothergill very properly advi&s;ed, that people in a &s;tate of per&s;piration &s;hould, to avoid all danger, eat a mouthful of bread, with a little &s;alt, and thus gain time, till the blood and the liquor
<PB N="268" REF="039111_0298_1013A129B9BB30A8">
to be drunk had acquired a more equal tem|perature. A &s;mall quantity of vinegar, or the juice of lemons in water, is well calculated to quench thir&s;t, and at the &s;ame time to pro|mote per&s;piration. Travellers on foot ought to be upon their guard again&s;t too much drink; for, the more liquids they take, the more they will per&s;pire, and the greater will be the &s;ub&s;equent relaxation and danger of cathing cold, when their clothes are &s;aturated with per&s;pirable matter. They &s;hould al&s;o ab&s;tain from drink productive of a laxative effect, which would cau&s;e debility, and even faintings. The mo&s;t &s;uitable of all &s;ub&s;tances to mix with water, is the pure or e&s;&s;ential acid of tartar, with a &s;mall quantity of &s;ugar. This affords a cooling and refre&s;hing beverage, without relaxing the bowels, like lemonade. Per&s;ons with whom vitriolic acid agrees, may take a tea-&s;poonful of a mixture, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix or eight parts of &s;pirits of wine, and one part of vitriolic acid, to a pint of water. A beverage made of a weak acidulated wine and water is cooling and &s;trengthening. In the very cold weather of winter, people ought to avoid all heating liquors, &s;uch as ardent &s;pirits and &s;trong wines. Warm diluents, &s;uch as tea and coffee, are equally improper, and a poor protection again&s;t cold; for their warm|ing property is of &s;hort duration; they are productive of debility, a more torpid circula|tion of the blood, and con&s;equently of an in|crea&s;e of cold. It is much better to eat pre|viou&s;ly &s;ome &s;olid meat, by which the dige&s;|tive organs may be exerci&s;ed, &s;uch as cold
<PB N="269" REF="039111_0299_1013A1486A46A990">
animal food and bread, and to drink after it &s;ome bitter ale or beer. On the other hand, when we &s;uffer from inten&s;e cold, or have been expo&s;ed to the wind and weather, a few cups of &s;trong tea, with plenty of cream and &s;ugar, is then the be&s;t and &s;afe&s;t refre&s;hment: and it is equally invigorating in &s;ummer after extreme heat and fatigue. Feeble individu|als, who&s;e &s;tomachs generate much acid, and who are frequently troubled on their journies with a &s;udden voracious appetite, are liable to the mo&s;t painful attacks of weakne&s;s on the road, and on that account they ought al|ways to be provided with &s;ome kind of &s;olid food in their excur&s;ions. Such per&s;ons &s;hould carefully ab&s;tain from the u&s;e of wine, brandy, or other heating and &s;timulating cordials, while travelling, e&s;pecially in the morning: they might with more advantage eat &s;ome bread and butter, warm or buttered ale, &s;trong broth, gruel, or the like nouri&s;hing &s;ub&s;tances.</P>
<P>We are now to con&s;ider the con&s;equences ari&s;ing from the <HI>want of exerci&s;e.</HI> This, indeed, is &s;till more debilitating than too violent mo|tion. The &s;olid parts of the human frame are relaxed by it; the circulation of the flu|ids is retarded; they gradually &s;tagnate in the &s;maller capillary ve&s;&s;els; the &s;ecretions are dimini&s;hed; and abundance of moi&s;ture or fat is generated, which renders the body, as well as the mind, more indolent and lifele&s;s:&mdash;relaxation of the mu&s;cles, ob&s;tructions of the inte&s;tines, hemorrhoids, apoplectic fits, various &s;pecies of drop&s;y, and at length a pre|mature
<PB N="270" REF="039111_0300_1013A12B45110328">
death, are the &s;ad con&s;equences. Men of letters are the mo&s;t unhealthy of all human beings, becau&s;e their bodies have &s;carcely any other exerci&s;e but the imperceptible motion of the arms. Want of appetite, flatulency, anxiety, at one time ob&s;tructions, at another diarrhoea, and the mo&s;t diver&s;ified nervous &s;ymptoms, are their attendants. Sleep is be|yond their reach; a thou&s;and tormenting in|conveniencies, hypochondria&s;is, and at length a complete &s;tate of melancholy, is too frequent|ly their lot. Temperance alone will not remedy all the&s;e evils; for &s;ince we cannot remain vigorous and healthy for two days together, with the &s;ame ma&s;s of blood, a new acce&s;s of the pure&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ubtle parts of our fluids mu&s;t daily &s;upport the nervous &s;y&s;|tem, in order to pre&s;erve its regular functions. If this be not continually re&s;tored, weakne&s;s and relaxation of body and mind are the in|evitable con&s;equences; with this difference only, that in a &s;tate of debility, from too much bodily exerci&s;e, the thick and coar&s;e particles of the fluids are carried into circula|tion with the others, and the next meal, or the fir&s;t &s;leep after it, very &s;oon &s;upplies the deficiency: in mental labour, on the contrary, dige&s;tion is interrupted, the crude and vi&s;cid parts of food remain una&s;&s;imilated, and the body is prevented from receiving its proper nouri&s;hment. In like manner, the &s;edentary mechanics and artificers are affected; partic|ularly &s;hoe-makers, taylors, and weavers. They experience hard&s;hips &s;imilar to tho&s;e, to which men of letters are &s;ubject; and it has
<PB N="271" REF="039111_0301_1013A0F93730A1B0">
been frequently ob&s;erved, that they are very liable to di&s;ea&s;es of the mind, and e&s;pecially to religious fanatici&s;m.</P>
<P><HI>Standing,</HI> though u&s;eful as a change after long &s;itting, is apt to occa&s;ion accumulations of blood, or rather of the &s;erous part of it, in the lower extremities. Swelled legs are there|fore common among printers. It is a po&s;ture little calculated to relieve the &s;tudious, and the body is at the &s;ame time more fatigued by &s;tanding than &s;itting. If we &s;it much, we mu&s;t attend to the two following rules: 1. that no part of the body be compre&s;&s;ed: and 2. that it be not too long continued at one time. The common manner of &s;itting, with the head reclined, is extremely perni|cious; for the circulation of the fluids in the abdomen is thus checked; the inte&s;tines are compre&s;&s;ed, and the ve&s;&s;els of the brea&s;t con|tracted. The head al&s;o &s;uffers by bending it too much forward; as the blood is thereby impelled to circulate towards it more copi|ou&s;ly than is con&s;i&s;tent with health. The &s;tudious, e&s;pecially, would do well, not to perform all their avocations in a &s;edentary po&s;ture, but occa&s;ionally to relieve at once their body and mind, by &s;tanding, or walking about the room. The mode of &s;itting ought al&s;o to be made as convenient as po&s;&s;ible, &s;o that both the body and head may be kept in an almo&s;t perpendicular po&s;ture; that the brea&s;t and abdomen may not be ob&s;tructed in their alternate expan&s;ion; and la&s;tly, that the arms and legs may not be held in a crooked and unnatural po&s;ition: all this &s;hould be
<PB N="272" REF="039111_0302_1013A12E025B7848">
particularly attended to, by tho&s;e who teach children to read and write. The pre&s;&s;ure of the abdominal mu&s;cles may in a great mea&s;|ure be prevented by high tables and de&s;ks, and by rai&s;ed &s;tools or chairs, upon which a per&s;on rather &s;tands than &s;its.</P>
<P>To lie or re&s;t horizontally is attended with a ce&s;&s;ation of all exerci&s;e. If the head be placed low, and this too long continued, there may ari&s;e head-ach, by the increa&s;ed pre&s;&s;ure of the blood on the brain. Here, likewi&s;e, a frequent change of po&s;ture is nec|e&s;&s;ary, in order to ob&s;truct none of the bodily functions, and to prevent the &s;tagnation of humours.</P>
<P>Finally, the <HI>faculties of the mind</HI> de&s;erve no le&s;s attention than tho&s;e of the body.</P>
<P>Alternate changes of tranquillity and activ|ity are equally beneficial to the mind, as re&s;t and exerci&s;e to the body. Too long contin|ued, too frequent, and too profound reflec|tions, are alike injurious to both. The &s;ame powers are dimini&s;hed here as in bodily la|bour, and in a &s;till greater proportion; for mu&s;cular exertions, though fatiguing, are re|productive of new vigour. This may indeed be al&s;o applied to mental labour, by which the mind improves in capacity, but the body is a &s;ufferer from every unu&s;ual exertion of the mind; and, with the body, the mind by degrees al&s;o becomes di&s;ea&s;ed:&mdash;in profound meditations the vital &s;pirits are, as it were, withdrawn from the organs of &s;en&s;e; the body is for the time almo&s;t deprived of &s;en&s;a|tion; and we frequently become in a manner

ab&s;ent. Reflection always directed to one ob|ject, not only debilitates, but al&s;o &s;uppre&s;&s;es the other faculties of the mind, and does not per|mit it to deviate from its favourite pur&s;uit. Thus we &s;ometimes &s;ee melancholy, nay mad|ne&s;s it&s;elf, overwhelm per&s;ons devoted to the contemplation of oue particular object. In|ten&s;e and ab&s;tru&s;e thought, in general, if not checked in time, may be attended with &s;tu|por or in&s;anity.</P>
<P>To enable us to reflect &s;eriou&s;ly upon an important &s;ubject, time and place ought to be &s;o cho&s;en that the mind may be diverted by no other object; for two ideas cannot be conceived at one time. Hence we &s;hould &s;tudy in an apartment which is not too light, and where we are undi&s;turbed by noi&s;e:&mdash;the mu&s;cles &s;hould not be actively employed during &s;tudy: it is therefore improper and pernicious, immediately after meals, or before dige&s;tion be completed. The morning, in|deed, is the mo&s;t profitable time for &s;tudy; though nece&s;&s;ity and cu&s;tom make many ex|ceptions; &s;o that &s;ome per&s;ons, from gradual practice, are able to perform their mental ta&s;ks during the greate&s;t noi&s;e, and in a room full of children.</P>
<P>Much and frequent inactivity of mind agrees, indeed, well with the body, which in that &s;tate fully performs its functions, but it becomes unwieldy, in&s;omuch as at length to &s;tupify the mental powers: the ideas become ob&s;cure and confu&s;ed; and a total lo&s;s of memory, or oblivion of the pa&s;t, is but too often the con&s;equent effect of &s;uch indolence.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of SLEEPING and WAKING: their ju&s;t propor|tion with regard to age, the con&s;titution of the body, mode of life, and other circum&s;tances.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>SLEEP and wakefulne&s;s are nearly in the &s;ame relation to each other as exerci&s;e and re&s;t. Waking always pre&s;uppo&s;es a certain degree of activity; all the <HI>natural</HI> functions, dige&s;tion, the preparation of the chyle and blood, a&s;&s;imilation, &s;ecretion and excretion, are then more vigorou&s;ly performed, and would &s;oon exhau&s;t their powers, if &s;leep did not re&s;tore to them the beneficial and indi&s;|pen&s;able &s;upplies.</P>
<P><HI>Sleep</HI> is therefore nece&s;&s;ary to exi&s;tence and health, and it is an improper and fruitle&s;s at|tempt, to deprive our&s;elves, by an ill-direct|ed activity, of the requi&s;ite portion of this refre&s;hment; for Nature will maintain her rights, in &s;pite of our efforts to &s;ubvert them: and both body and mind &s;uffer, without at|taining any real advantage from an extrava|gant watchfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>Before I proceed to inquire into the con&s;e|quences ari&s;ing from either too much or too little &s;leep, it will be u&s;eful to premi&s;e a con|ci&s;e theory, or the phy&s;iology of this &s;u&s;pen|&s;ion of the mental powers.</P>
<P>When the body is fatigued, when the &s;en|&s;es, together with the voluntary motions of the mu&s;cles, have been for &s;ome time active, we &s;tand in need of the alternation of re&s;t,
<PB N="275" REF="039111_0305_1013A0FF5E2BE468">
which is obtained by &s;leep. During a &s;ound &s;leep, the &s;en&s;es, and the voluntary mu&s;cular motions, are not exerci&s;ed; but the <HI>vital</HI> functions, &s;uch as re&s;piration, and the circu|lation of the blood, as well as mo&s;t of the nat|ural functions aforementioned, are regularly though more &s;lowly performed. During &s;leep, therefore, the motion of the heart and the blood-ve&s;&s;els, even the action of the brain and the nervous &s;y&s;tem, as likewi&s;e the peri&s;taltic or vermicular motion of the &s;tomach and the inte&s;tines, and the &s;ecretion of the fluids, are performed in an uniform and &s;teady manner. Previous to &s;leep, we perceive a languor of the &s;en&s;es, and of the mu&s;cles which are &s;ub|ject to our will, and of tho&s;e al&s;o which keep the body in an erect po&s;ture; the head in|clines downwards, the upper eye-lid and the lower jaw-bone likewi&s;e &s;ink, the venous blood accumulates towards the heart, and compels us to yawn, in order to facilitate the tran&s;i|tion of the blood into the lungs, by the deep breathing which takes place: finally, the brain it&s;elf, as the organ of the mind, appears to be fatigued; hence our ideas become irregular, and there ari&s;es a kind of faint imbecility of the under&s;tanding. That the motions of the heart are &s;tronger during &s;leep, and that per|&s;piration is more active, mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to the warmth of the bed-clothes, by which the in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration &s;oftens and relaxes the &s;kin. But a per&s;on, who &s;leeps in his u&s;ual dre&s;s, will feel chilly; and tho&s;e animals that &s;leep long, as the hedge-hog, the murmur-deer

(<HI>Marmota Alpina,</HI> L.) &s;uffer an extraordinary degree of cold.</P>
<P>As the &s;en&s;es are inactive during &s;leep; as the nervous energy is le&s;s exhau&s;ted, and its &s;ecretion continued, a new &s;upply of it is col|lected, and the organs of &s;en&s;e, as well as the mu&s;cles, receive additional vigour. This oc|ca&s;ions us to awake, particularly if rou&s;ed by any &s;timulus. While we are a&s;leep, the nu|tritive particles can more ea&s;ily attach them|&s;elves to the fibres, and fat al&s;o is more read|ily generated, from the retarded circulation of the blood. After we have &s;lept &s;ufficiently, we are apt, on awaking, to &s;tretch the limbs and joints of the body, and &s;ometimes to yawn: the latter, with an in&s;tinctive de&s;ire of promoting the circulation of blood through the lungs, which was retarded during &s;leep; the former, namely &s;tretching, in order to a&s;|&s;i&s;t the exten&s;or mu&s;cles, which, by the flex|ion of the limbs in &s;leep, had been more ex|tended, and in order to expand again the flexor mu&s;cles, that had been moderately con|tracted.</P>
<P>The proximate cau&s;e of &s;leep appears to be an impeded motion of the nervous fluid in the brain. This motion is produced by a kind of collap&s;e of the &s;ubtle in&s;ertions of the nerves, as well as by a mechanical compre&s;|&s;ion of them. Hence we can explain, how things &s;o totally oppo&s;ite are able to produce &s;leep, when they either exhau&s;t or compre&s;s the tubes of the nerves. Of the former kind is every violent and fatiguing &s;pecies of la|bour, a con&s;iderable lo&s;s of blood, per&s;piration
<PB N="277" REF="039111_0307_1013A101F5AE4388">
increa&s;ed by external heat, and every thing that withdraws the blood from the head; for in&s;tance, warm baths of the lower ex|tremities, a &s;tomach filled with much food, &amp;c. Of the latter kind of incitements to &s;leep, namely, tho&s;e that act by compre&s;&s;ion, is every mechanical pre&s;&s;ure on the brain, whether it proceed from water accumulated in its ventricles, from a local depre&s;&s;ion or fracture of the cranium, or from extrava&s;ated blood:&mdash;in like manner, the impeded regre&s;s of the blood from the brain, or the increa&s;ed acce&s;s of it to that organ, may effect &s;uch a pre&s;&s;ure, by di&s;tending the blood-ve&s;&s;els, as is the ca&s;e in u&s;ing narcotics, or wine and other &s;pirituous liquors; and, la&s;tly, an inten&s;e de|gree of cold, as well as the &s;tate of an approaching apoplexy. Sleep is promoted by tranquillity of mind; by the ab&s;ence of every &s;timulus to the body; by &s;ilence and dark|ne&s;s around us; by a complete re&s;t of the &s;en&s;es; by gently and uniformly affecting one of the &s;en&s;es, for in&s;tance, by mu&s;ic or read|ing; and, la&s;tly, by a gentle external motion of the whole body, as by rocking or &s;ailing. On the other hand, every painful &s;en&s;ation, a great noi&s;e, a bright light, &s;trong exertions of mental powers, and particularly violent pa&s;|&s;ions, are calculated to prevent &s;leep. Thus likewi&s;e &s;leep may be impeded by hot, &s;picy, and other kinds of drink, which are &s;aid to occa&s;ion a more &s;peedy &s;ecretion of the ner|vous fluid.</P>
<P><HI>Dreams</HI> are vagaries of the imagination, and in mo&s;t in&s;tances proceed from external &s;en|&s;ations.
<PB N="278" REF="039111_0308_1013A136CD479CC8">
They take place only, when our &s;leep is un&s;ound, in which ca&s;e the brain and nervous &s;y&s;tem are capable of performing the motions above de&s;cribed. We &s;eldom dream during the fir&s;t hours of &s;leep; perhaps, be|cau&s;e the nervous fluid is then too much ex|hau&s;ted; but dreams rather occur towards the morning, when this fluid has been, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, re&s;tored. Every thing capable of interrupting the tranquillity of mind and body, may produce dreams. Such are the various kinds of grief and &s;orrow, exertions of the mind, affections and pa&s;&s;ions, crude and undige&s;ted food, a hard and inconvenient po&s;ture of the body. Tho&s;e ideas which have lately occupied our mind, or made a lively impre&s;&s;ion upon us, generally con&s;titute the principal &s;ubject of a dream, and more or le&s;s employ our imagination, when we are a&s;leep. Animals are likewi&s;e apt to dream, but &s;el|dom; and even men living temperately, and enjoying a perfect &s;tate of health, are &s;eldom di&s;turbed with this play of the fancy. Nay, there are examples of lively and &s;pirited per|&s;ons who never dream. The great phy&s;iol|ogi&s;t, HALLER, con&s;iders dreaming as a &s;ymp|tom of di&s;ea&s;e, or as a &s;timulating cau&s;e, by which the perfect tranquillity of the <HI>&s;en&s;orium</HI> is interrupted. Hence, that &s;leep is the mo&s;t refre&s;hing, which is undi&s;turbed by dreams, or, at lea&s;t, when we have no clear recollection of them.</P>

The place where a per&s;on whom we love former|ly re&s;ided, a dre&s;s &s;imilar to that which we have &s;een her wear, the objects that employed her attention, no &s;ooner catch our eye, than &s;he immediately occupies our mind. And, though the&s;e images, a&s;&s;ociating with exter|nal &s;en&s;ations, do not arrive at complete con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, within the power of imagination, yet even in their latent &s;tate they may become very &s;trong and permanent. I have been in|formed, for in&s;tance, of a young man, who was attacked with convul&s;ions, every time he heard the name of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> repeated; owing, it &s;eems, to the circum&s;tance of his mother hav|ing once invoked the name of Je&s;us in a ter|rific voice and manner, when &s;he, as well as the boy, were much frightened by a tremen|dous peal of thunder. But this is only an indirect demon&s;tration of the exi&s;tence of a faculty, which is very active in dreams, and which may be aptly called the <HI>&s;ubrea&s;oning fac|ulty,</HI> or the power of ab&s;tracting &s;imilarities. The conclu&s;ions, thus formed, are more fre|quent and active, than in the waking &s;tate; becau&s;e they are &s;eldom controlled by the re|flections of rea&s;on. I &s;hall make u&s;e of one illu&s;tration only.</P>
<P>Very frequently we find, that in a dream a &s;eries of repre&s;entations is &s;uddenly interrupt|ed, and another &s;eries of a very different kind

occupies its place. This happens, as &s;oon as an idea a&s;&s;ociates it&s;elf; which, from what|ever cau&s;e, is more intere&s;ting than that im|mediately preceding. It then becomes the prevailing one, and determines the a&s;&s;ociation. Yet by this, too, the imagination is frequent|ly re-conducted to the former &s;eries. The in|terruption in the cour&s;e of the preceding oc|currences is remarked, and the power of ab|&s;tracting &s;imilarities is in &s;earch of the cau&s;e of this irregularity. Hence, in &s;uch ca&s;es, there u&s;ually happens &s;ome unfortunate event or other, which occa&s;ions the interruption of the &s;tory. The repre&s;enting power may &s;ud|denly again conduct us to another &s;eries of ideas, and thus the imagination may be led by the &s;ubrea&s;oning power before defined, from one &s;cene to another. Of this kind, for in&s;tance, is the following remarkable dream, as related and explained in the words of Prof. MAASS, of <HI>Halle:</HI> "I dreamed once," &s;ays he, "that the Pope vi&s;ited me. He commanded me to open my de&s;k, and he carefully exam|ined all the papers it contained. While he was thus employed, a very &s;parkling dia|mond fell out of his triple crown into my de&s;k, of which, however, neither of us took any notice. As &s;oon as the Pope had with|drawn, I retired to bed, but was &s;oon obliged to ri&s;e, on account of a thick &s;moke, the cau&s;e of which I had yet to learn. Upon examina|tion, I di&s;covered, that the diamond had &s;et fire to the papers in my de&s;k, and burnt them to a&s;hes."</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="039111_0311_1013A106154DACA0">
This dream de&s;erves a &s;hort analy&s;is, on account of the peculiar circum&s;tances which occa&s;ioned it. "On the preceding evening," &s;ays Prof. Maa&s;s, "I was vi&s;ited by a friend, with whom I had a lively conver&s;ation upon Jo&s;eph II.'s &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of mona&s;teries and con|vents. With this idea&punc; though I did not be|come con&s;cious of it in the dream, was a&s;&s;o|ciated the vi&s;it which the Pope publickly paid the Emperor Jo&s;eph at Vienna, in con&s;equence of the mea&s;ures taken again&s;t the clergy; and with this again was combined, however faint|ly, the repre&s;entation of the vi&s;it, which had been paid me by my friend. The&s;e two events were, by the &s;ubrea&s;oning faculty, compounded into one, according to the e&s;|tabli&s;hed rule&mdash;that things which agree in their parts, do al&s;o corre&s;pond as to the whole;&mdash;hence the Pope's vi&s;it was changed into a vi&s;it made to me. The &s;ubrea&s;oning faculty, then, in order to account for this ex|traordinary vi&s;it, fixed upon that which was the mo&s;t important object<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> in my room, namely, the de&s;k, or rather the papers locked up in it. That a diamond fell out of the triple crown, was a collateral a&s;&s;ociation, which was owing merely to the repre&s;enta|tion of the de&s;k. Some days before, when opening the de&s;k, I had broken the gla&s;s of my watch, which I held in my hand, &s;o that the gla&s;s fell among the papers. Hence no farther attention was paid to the diamond, being a repre&s;entation of a collateral &s;eries of things. But afterwards, the repre&s;entation of the &s;parkling &s;tone was again excited, and
<PB N="282" REF="039111_0312_1013A13B373E3258">
became the prevailing idea; hence it deter|mined the &s;ucceeding a&s;&s;ociation. On account of its &s;imilarity, it excited the repre&s;entation of fire, and was indeed confounded with it. Hence aro&s;e fire and &s;moke. But, in the event, the writings only were burnt, not the de&s;k it&s;elf, to which, being of comparative|ly le&s;s value, the attention was not at all di|rected."</P>
<P>It is farther undeniable, that there are in the human mind certain ob&s;cure repre&s;enta|tions, and that it is of great advantage to be convinced of the reality of the&s;e images, if de&s;irous of perceiving the connexion &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ing among the operations of the imagination. Of the numerous phenomena, founded on ob&s;cure ideas, and which con&s;equently prove their exi&s;tence, I &s;hall only remark the fol|lowing. It is a well known fact, that many dreams originate in the impre&s;&s;ions made on the body during &s;leep; that they con&s;i&s;t of analogous images, or &s;uch as are a&s;&s;ociated with &s;en&s;ations that would ari&s;e from the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions during a waking &s;tate. Hence, for in&s;tance, if our legs are placed in a perpen|dicular po&s;ture, we are often terrified by a dream, that implies the imminent danger of falling from a &s;teep rock or precipice. The &s;oul mu&s;t repre&s;ent to it&s;elf the&s;e external impre&s;&s;ions in a lively manner, otherwi&s;e no ideal picture could be thus excited. But, as we do not become at all con&s;cious of them, they are but faintly and ob&s;curely repre&s;ented.</P>
<P>If we make a re&s;olution of ri&s;ing earlier in the morning than u&s;ual; and if we imprint
<PB N="283" REF="039111_0313_1013A109DC535BA8">
this determination on our mind, immediately before going to bed, we are almo&s;t certain to &s;ucceed. Now it is &s;elf-evident, that this &s;uc|ce&s;s cannot be a&s;cribed to the efforts of the body, but altogether to the mind; which probably during &s;leep perceives and computes the duration of time, &s;o that it makes an im|pre&s;&s;ion on the body, whereby we are enabled to awake at an appointed hour. Yet all this takes place, without our con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, and the repre&s;entations remain ob&s;cure.</P>
<P>Many productions of art are &s;o complicated, that a variety of &s;imple conceptions are re|qui&s;ite to lay the foundation of them; yet the arti&s;t is almo&s;t entirely uncon&s;cious of the&s;e individual notions. Thus, a per&s;on per|forms a piece of mu&s;ic, without being oblig|ed to reflect, in a con&s;cious manner, on the &s;ignification of the notes, their value, and the order of the fingers he mu&s;t ob&s;erve; nay even without clearly di&s;tingui&s;hing the &s;trings of the harp, or the keys of the harp&s;ichord.&mdash;We cannot attribute this to the mechani&s;m of the body, which might gradually accu&s;tom it|&s;elf to the accurate placing of the fingers.&mdash;This could be applied only where we play a piece of mu&s;ic, frequently practi&s;ed; but it is totally inapplicable to a new piece, which is played by the profe&s;&s;or with equal facility, though he has never &s;een it before. In the latter ca&s;e, there mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e an ideal repre&s;entation, or an act of judgment, pre|vious to every motion of the &s;ingers.</P>
<P>The&s;e arguments, I hope, &s;ufficiently evince the occurrence of &s;uch ob&s;cure notions and
<PB N="284" REF="039111_0314_1013A13EF205BD88">
repre&s;entations, as lay the ground-work of all our dreams. That among the thou&s;ands and millions of fanciful and &s;uppo&s;ed ominous dreams, &s;ome are occa&s;ionally realized, is not a matter of a&s;toni&s;hment; but many people, particularly the victims of the lottery, too frequently find rea&s;on to regret, that the&s;e omens are not always to be depended upon; if tho&s;e deluded vi&s;ionaries would permit them&s;elves to rea&s;on, and to calculate, they would di&s;cover, that there are as many chances again&s;t their dream being realized, as there are again&s;t their ticket turning up a twenty thou&s;and pounds prize.</P>
<P>Before I quit this &s;ubject, I &s;hall relate an extraordinary dream of the celebrated Italian, GALILEO. When this great man, at a very advanced age, had lo&s;t the u&s;e of his eyes, he was once conducted in his walks over a beau|tiful plain, by his pupil, TORICELLI. "Once," &s;aid the aged &s;age, "my eyes permitted me to enjoy the charms of the&s;e fields. But now, &s;ince their light is extingui&s;hed, the&s;e plea&s;|ures are lo&s;t to me for ever. Heaven ju&s;tly inflicts the puni&s;hment which was predicted to me many years ago. When in pri&s;on, and impatiently langui&s;hing for liberty, I began to be di&s;contented with the ways of Provi|dence; COPERNICUS appeared to me in a dream; his cele&s;tial &s;pirit conducted me over luminous &s;tars, and, in a threatening voice, reprehended me for having murmured again&s;t him, at who&s;e <HI>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">at</HI> all the&s;e worlds had pro|ceeded from nothing. "A time &s;hall come," &s;aid he, "when thine eyes &s;hall refu&s;e to a&s;|&s;i&s;t thee in contemplating the&s;e wonders."</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="039111_0315_1013A10C6D230DC0">
After this long, though I hope not unin|tere&s;ting digre&s;&s;ion, I proceed to &s;tate the con|&s;equences ari&s;ing from too much or too little &s;leep.</P>
<P>To continue in a waking &s;tate, beyond a proper time, con&s;umes the vital &s;pirits, di&s;or|ganizes the nerves, and cau&s;es &s;o many un|ea&s;y &s;en&s;ations, that a con&s;iderable while mu&s;t elap&s;e before we can fall a&s;leep, namely, until their greate&s;t violence has abated. The flu|ids of the body become acrid, the fat is con|&s;umed, and there ari&s;es at length an inclina|tion to vertigo, violent head-ach, anxiety, ac|tions without connexion, without de&s;ign, and without con&s;i&s;tency. Tho&s;e who indulge them&s;elves in much &s;leep, are &s;eldom liable to very &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions. Per&s;ons, on the con|trary, who &s;leep too little, frequently con|tract a violent and vindictive temper. Long-continued wakefulne&s;s is capable of changing the temper and di&s;po&s;ition of mind of the mo&s;t mild and gentle; of affecting a complete al|teration of their features, and, at length, of occa&s;ioning the mo&s;t &s;ingular whims, the &s;trange&s;t deviations in the power of imagina|tion, and, in the end, ab&s;olute in&s;anity.</P>
<P>Exce&s;s of &s;leep, however, is not le&s;s preju|dicial. The whole body &s;inks gradually un|der a complete &s;tate of inactivity, the &s;olid parts become relaxed, the blood circulates &s;lowly, and remains particularly long in the head: per&s;piration is di&s;ordered, the fluids are incra&s;&s;ated, the body increa&s;es in fat and thick humours, and is rendered incapable of being the medium of mental exertion, the
<PB N="286" REF="039111_0316_1013A140784E4A98">
memory is enfeebled, and the unhappy &s;leep|er falls into a thoughtle&s;s lethargic &s;tate, by which his &s;en&s;ibility is, in a great mea&s;ure, de|&s;troyed.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons troubled with hypochondria&s;is and hy&s;terics do them&s;elves much injury by &s;leeping too long, e&s;pecially in the morning, when the body is much weakened by its too long continuance in a heated and unwhole|&s;ome atmo&s;phere. To &s;uch individuals, it is al&s;o dangerous to remain for a length of time in a &s;tate of inactivity. Indeed, exce&s;s in &s;leeping is detrimental to the mu&s;cular pow|ers of every per&s;on; to the phlegmatic, e&s;pe|cially, who&s;e fluids will thus &s;oon be univer|&s;ally corrupted; and &s;anguine temperaments thereby acquire a &s;uperabundance of blood. The melancholy, who&s;e blood circulates &s;low|ly, mu&s;t &s;uffer inconveniencies in their &s;ecre|tions and excretions by this indulgence; and we generally find, that long &s;leepers are af|flicted with co&s;tivene&s;s and ob&s;tructions.&mdash;Early ri&s;ing, and timely going to bed, may a|lone render them more healthy and vigorous.</P>
<P>If it can be advantageous to any de&s;cription of per&s;ons, to &s;leep beyond the u&s;ual portion of time, it is to the choleric. To &s;leep im|mediately after &s;upper, is apt to occa&s;ion the night-mare, or a &s;tagnation of the blood, which, by its pre&s;&s;ure, produces the &s;en&s;ation or idea of this trouble&s;ome bed-fellow. It is principally the nervous, the debilitated, and tho&s;e of an impaired dige&s;tion, who are vi&s;it|ed by &s;uch terrifying dreams.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="039111_0317_1013A10DF3D3F1C0">
The proper duration of &s;leep, in youth and adults, is u&s;ually &s;ettled at &s;ix or &s;even hours; in children and the aged, from eight to nine hours. Yet the individual deviations in the con&s;titution of the body, and its various wants, &s;carcely admit of any accurate rules. The more bodily weakne&s;s we feel, the more we may indulge in &s;leep, provided it be re|fre&s;hing. If people in a &s;tate of health are perfectly cheerful in mind and body, when they fir&s;t awake, this is the mo&s;t certain cri|terion, that they have &s;lept &s;ufficiently.</P>
<P>We &s;hould, however, be on our guard, not to confound the natural wants of the body with a blameable cu&s;tom. For mo&s;t per&s;ons habitually &s;leep too much, or remain longer in bed than they ought. The principal cau&s;e of this de&s;tructive cu&s;tom undoubtedly ari&s;es in infancy; when children are permitted to &s;leep in very &s;oft and heating beds, and en|couraged to lie longer than is proper, from a mi&s;taken notion that they cannot &s;leep too much. From this injudicious treatment, they cannot attain a &s;olid texture of the body, and a foundation is laid for many &s;ub&s;equent di&s;|ea&s;es. The rickets, &s;o very common in many families, in the pre&s;ent age, often originate in &s;uch indulgencies, &s;ince the general relaxation of the body, and the tendency to profu&s;e per|&s;piration, is thus promoted in an extraordi|nary degree. At the age of puberty, this ef|feminacy of the body, and the inclination to &s;leep, together with the plea&s;ant &s;en&s;ation, which a &s;oft and warm bed affords in a wak|ing &s;tate, are certainly the fir&s;t and mo&s;t fre|quent
<PB N="288" REF="039111_0318_1013A14312B3D398">
cau&s;es of a vice, that might be effectual|ly prevented by early ri&s;ing.</P>
<P>The cu&s;tom of &s;leeping long, when contin|ued to the &s;tate of manhood, becomes &s;o habit|ual that it cannot be relinqui&s;hed without great &s;truggles, and a firm re&s;olution. Tho&s;e, then, who are not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this firmne&s;s, in&s;tead of attaining a &s;trong con&s;titution, will acquire a phlegmatic, relaxed, and cold temperament, which will render them ir|re&s;olute, and incapable of energetic efforts; and from which the mind, by degrees, becomes as indifferent towards every object, as the body is unfit for mu&s;cular exertion.&mdash;Hence, to li&s;ten to the voice of Nature, in this re&s;pect, will contribute more to our happine&s;s, than to &s;horten our repo&s;e by many of the u&s;ual but violent means of excitement, when the body is in want of re&s;t.</P>
<P>To children, at a very early period of life, no limits of &s;leep can be pre&s;cribed; but, af|ter the &s;ixth or &s;eventh year of age, &s;ome re|gulations become nece&s;&s;ary, to habituate them to a certain regularity. The ju&s;t proportion of &s;leep can be a&s;certained only, by their more or le&s;s lively temperament, by their employ|ments, exerci&s;e and amu&s;ements through the day, and according to the more or le&s;s healthy &s;tate of their bodies. In pur&s;uing this mea&s;ure, however, we mu&s;t not attempt to awaken children from their &s;leep, in a violent or ter|rifying manner, which is frequently done, and is extremely pernicious.</P>
<P>In great di&s;quietude of mind, and after vi|olent pa&s;&s;ions, &s;leep is the more nece&s;&s;ary, as
<PB N="289" REF="039111_0319_1013A110E1DC2AC8">
the&s;e agitate and exhau&s;t the frame, more than the mo&s;t fatiguing bodily labour. Hence, many per&s;ons never &s;leep &s;o &s;ound, as when they are afflicted with grief and &s;orrow. A fretful and peevi&s;h temper, as well as a fit of the hypochondria&s;is, cannot be more effectu|ally relieved, than by a &s;hort &s;leep. Frequent|ly, after a &s;leep, of a few minutes only, we awake refre&s;hed, we can reflect on our diffi|culties with a calm mind, and again recon|cile our&s;elves to the troubles of life. In &s;uch &s;ituations, though we &s;hould not be able to &s;leep, even a quiet po&s;ture of the body, with the eyes clo&s;ed, is of &s;ome advantage.</P>
<P>There is &s;carcely any misfortune &s;o great, that it cannot be relieved or alleviated by &s;leep; as, on the contrary, we &s;hould inevitably &s;ink under its pre&s;&s;ure, if this beneficent balm did not &s;upport us. Yet, frequently too, unea|&s;ine&s;s of mind, by its continual &s;timulus on the <HI>cen&s;orium,</HI> prevents all &s;leep: hence the unquiet repo&s;e and even whole &s;leeple&s;s nights of tho&s;e, who&s;e heads are filled with cares or important &s;chemes. As mental labours ex|hau&s;t our &s;trength more than tho&s;e of the bo|dy, literary men, who employ them&s;elves in long and profound reflections, require more &s;leep than others. Though &s;ome per&s;ons, who&s;e body and mind are equally indolent, have a greater inclination to &s;leep, than the lively and laborious, yet it is not &s;o beneficial to them; &s;ince they are de&s;titute of the e&s;|&s;ential requi&s;ites to health, namely, activity and vigour.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="039111_0320_1013A144CB610A48">
The mo&s;t healthy, and tho&s;e who lead the mo&s;t regular lives, frequently have an unea&s;y and very &s;hort &s;leep: they al&s;o require le&s;s re&s;t at one time than another. He who di|ge&s;ts ea&s;ily, &s;tands le&s;s in need of &s;leep than others. After taking aliment difficult of di|ge&s;tion, Nature her&s;elf invites to the enjoy|ment of re&s;t, and to &s;leep in proportion to the time which is required for the concoction and a&s;&s;imilation of food.&mdash;Exce&s;&s;ive evacuations of whatever kind, as well as intoxication by &s;trong liquors, render additional &s;leep nece&s;|&s;ary. In winter and &s;ummer, we require &s;omewhat more time for &s;leep than in &s;pring and autumn; becau&s;e the vital &s;pirits are le&s;s exhau&s;ted in the latter &s;ea&s;ons, and the ma&s;s of the blood circulates more uniformly, than in the cold of winter or heat of &s;ummer, when it is either too much retarded, or accel|erated.</P>
<P>It is very improper to &s;it up too late in the long winter evenings, whether at the de&s;k or the bottle, either of which is then more hurtful than in &s;ummer, becau&s;e the want of &s;leep is greater. Tho&s;e who wi&s;h to &s;pend the winter in good health, and u&s;eful labour, &s;hould retire to bed at eight o'clock in the evening, and ri&s;e at three or four o'clock in the morning. A winter morning, indeed, is not very charming, but the evening is <HI>natur|ally</HI> &s;till le&s;s &s;o; and there is no doubt, that we can perform every kind of work, with more alacrity and &s;ucce&s;s, in the early part of the day than at night, and that our eye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> would likewi&s;e be benefited by this regula|tion,

after &s;leep has enabled them to under|take any ta&s;k in the morning; but they are fatigued at night, from the exertions of a whole day.</P>
<P>Every &s;timulus may interrupt &s;leep, or at lea&s;t render it unea&s;y, and often occa&s;ion dreams, the cau&s;e of which is generally owing to an irritation in the &s;tomach, or in the inte&s;|tinal canal. Dreams are, as it were, a middle &s;tate between &s;leeping and waking, and gen|erally indicate &s;ome defect in the body, un|le&s;s they give repre&s;entations which originate in the occurrences of the preceding day.</P>
<P>An unea&s;y &s;leep, which is obvious from &s;tarting up, or &s;peaking in it, and from a fre|quent change of the po&s;ture in bed, is at no time a good &s;ymptom; it is as frequently a forerunner, as it is the effect of di&s;ea&s;e, and may be owing to the following cau&s;es:</P>
<P N="1">1. Emotions of the mind and violent pa&s;|&s;ions always di&s;order the vital &s;pirits;&mdash;at one time they increa&s;e, at another dimini&s;h, and &s;ometimes altogether check their influence, the con&s;equences of which extend to the whole circulation of the blood. Sorrows and cares produce a &s;imilar effect. Hence the nocturnal couch is a very improper place to pro&s;ecute moral re&s;earches, or to recollect what we have done, &s;poken, and thought through the day.&mdash;To read intere&s;ting letters, received late in the evening, u&s;ually too oc|ca&s;ions an unquiet &s;leep.</P>
<P N="2">2. A bad &s;tate of dige&s;tion, and e&s;pecially hard or corrupted food, on account of the connexion of the brain with the &s;tomach.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="292" REF="039111_0322_1013A0F7B1038FC8">
3. A repelled per&s;piration, if we have not covered our&s;elves conformably to the climate, &s;ea&s;on, and weather.&mdash;In this ca&s;e, a current of air is &s;till more hurtful than inten&s;e cold.</P>
<P N="4">4. An apartment or bed to which we are not accu&s;tomed may al&s;o occa&s;ion an uncom|fortable &s;leep, as travellers frequently experi|ence. It is therefore an e&s;&s;ential part of a good and healthful education, to accu&s;tom children to &s;leep alternately upon different, and harder or &s;ofter couches, in various parts of the hou&s;e, more or le&s;s temperate, which con&s;equently enables them to &s;leep comfort|ably in a &s;imple but clean bed, in whatever place or &s;ituation they may find it.</P>
<P>Debilitated per&s;ons injure them&s;elves much by &s;leeping during the day, again&s;t the order of Nature, and keeping awake the greater part of the night. Day-light is be&s;t adapted to ac|tive employments; and the gloom and &s;till|ne&s;s of the night to repo&s;e. The evening-air which we inhale &s;oon after &s;un-&s;et, and night-air in general, which is vitiated in the coun|try by the exhalations of plants, is very detri|mental to the delicate. The forced watchful|ne&s;s of tho&s;e who apply them&s;elves in the night to mental pur&s;uits, is exceedingly pre|judicial. A couple of hours &s;leep before mid|night is, according to old experience, more refre&s;hing than double the quantity after that period.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion, whether to <HI>&s;leep after dinner</HI> be advi&s;able, mu&s;t be decided by a variety of concurrent circum&s;tances; cu&s;tom, bodily con|&s;titution, age, climate, and the like.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="039111_0323_1013A1174E715B70">
In a weak and &s;low &s;tate of dige&s;tion, after having taken hard or &s;olid food, we may in|dulge our&s;elves in a &s;hort &s;leep, rather than after a meal con&s;i&s;ting of &s;uch nouri&s;hment, as by its nature is ea&s;ily concocted. But de|bilitated young people e&s;pecially &s;hould not &s;leep too much, though their weakne&s;s incline them to it; for the more they indulge in it, the greater will be their &s;ub&s;equent languor and relaxation.</P>
<P>Individuals of a vigorous and quick con|coction may undertake gentle, but not violent exerci&s;e, immediately after meals, if they have eaten food that is ea&s;ily dige&s;tible, and which requires little a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but that of the &s;tom|ach and its fluids. And even &s;uch per&s;ons, if they have made u&s;e of provi&s;ions difficult to be concocted, ought to remain quiet after din|ner, and may occa&s;ionally allow them&s;elves half an hour's &s;leep, in order to &s;upport di|ge&s;tion.</P>
<P>To re&s;t a little after dinner, is farther u&s;e|ful to dry and emaciated per&s;ons, to the aged, and per&s;ons of an ira&s;cible di&s;po&s;ition; to tho&s;e who have &s;pent the preceding night un|ea&s;ily and &s;leeple&s;s, or have been otherwi&s;e fa|tigued, in order to re&s;tore regularity in the in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration; but in this ca&s;e the body mu&s;t be well covered, that it may not be expo&s;ed to cold. Such as are fond of &s;leep|ing at any time of the day, are u&s;ually more indolent and heavy after it than before. A &s;leep after dinner ought never to exceed one hour; and it is al&s;o much better &s;itting than lying horizontally; for, in the latter ca&s;e, we
<PB N="294" REF="039111_0324_1013A14C11427118">
are more &s;ubject to fluctuations of the blood towards the head, and con&s;equently to head-ach.</P>
<P>Much depends upon the manner of lying in bed, and on the po&s;ture to which we accu&s;|tom our&s;elves. To lie on the back, with the arms over the head, prevents the circulation of the blood to the arms, and is not unfre|quently productive of &s;erious con&s;equences. It is equally pernicious to lie in a crooked po&s;|ture, or with the brea&s;t very low and bent inwards; for the inte&s;tines are thereby com|pre&s;&s;ed and ob&s;tructed in their motions, and the blood cannot ea&s;ily circulate downwards; whence may ari&s;e giddine&s;s and even apoplexy. Lying on the back is equally improper, and produces frightful dreams, together with ma|ny other inconveniencies; the rever&s;e po&s;ture is likewi&s;e noxious, as the &s;tomach is thus vi|olently oppre&s;&s;ed, the free re&s;piration much impeded, and the whole circulation of the fluids in the che&s;t and abdomen wantonly prevented, to the great injury of health.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t proper po&s;ture, then, is on one &s;ide, with the body &s;traight, the limbs &s;light|ly bent (not &s;tretched, becau&s;e they ought to re&s;t) &s;o that the body may lie &s;omewhat high|er than the legs. When the head is laid high, a &s;hort &s;leep is more refre&s;hing than a longer one when it is reclined too low. To healthy people it is a matter of no con&s;equence on which &s;ide they lie, and they may &s;afely, in this re&s;pect, follow their own choice. Some dietetical ob&s;ervers allege, that it is better to lie in the evening on the right, and in the
<PB N="295" REF="039111_0325_1013A118D359A4D0">
morning on the left &s;ide; that in the even|ing the food may more readily leave the &s;tom|ach, and that afterwards this organ may be better warmed by the liver.</P>
<P>In the evening we &s;hould eat light food on|ly, and that &s;paringly, wait for its dige&s;tion, and con&s;equently not lie down till two or three hours after &s;upper. The mind ought to be kept quiet and cheerful, previous to going to re&s;t: we &s;hould then, as much as po&s;&s;i|ble, avoid gloomy thoughts, which require reflection and exertion. It is therefore a pernicious and dangerous practice to read our&s;elves a&s;leep in bed. We would do much better, to exerci&s;e our&s;elves a little before bed-time, by walking up and down the room.</P>
<P>Sleep without dreams, of whatever nature they may be, is more healthful than when at|tended with the&s;e fancies. Yet dreams of an agreeable kind promote the free circulation of the blood, the better concoction of food, and a due &s;tate of per&s;piration. The contra|ry takes place in unplea&s;ant dreams, which excite anxiety, terror, grief, fear, and the like. In the latter ca&s;e&punc; they are of them&s;elves &s;ymp|toms of irregularity in the &s;y&s;tem, of an ap|proaching di&s;order, or of an improper po&s;ture of the body. The functions of the body be|fore mentioned are impeded by &s;uch dreams; and the vital &s;pirits, which ought to be re|&s;tored and cheri&s;hed, are again di&s;&s;ipated by violent emotions, in&s;omuch that the body and the mind continue unrefre&s;hed.</P>
<P>In order to pre&s;erve the body warm, we make u&s;e of feather-beds and covers:&mdash;in
<PB N="296" REF="039111_0326_1013A14D94D6E278">
&s;ummer, at lea&s;t, we ought to &s;leep upon mat|tre&s;&s;es. It is a mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential requi&s;ite to every per&s;on, who wi&s;hes to lead an agreeable, ac|tive, and u&s;eful life, to provide him&s;elf in time with a <HI>proper</HI> couch. To in&s;ure all the advantages which may be derived from this quarter, nothing is better than a mattre&s;s filled with hor&s;e-hair, or, if cheapne&s;s be an object, with dry mo&s;s, at lea&s;t &s;ix inches thick. Sev|eral of &s;uch mattre&s;&s;es may be placed one above another; the bol&s;ter ought to be well &s;tuffed and ela&s;tic; in winter with feathers, and during the &s;ummer with hor&s;e-hair, more or le&s;s high, according to circum&s;tances, but always &s;o that the head may lie con&s;iderably more elevated than the brea&s;t and the re&s;t of the body.</P>
<P>The cover &s;hould never be tucked in too clo&s;ely, that the acce&s;s of external air may not be altogether excluded. If we make u&s;e of a bed&s;tead or a &s;ofa provided with &s;teel &s;prings, one of the mattre&s;&s;es above de&s;cribed, with a &s;imilar bol&s;ter, and the light cover of a dou|ble blanket, will be found &s;ufficient. The&s;e beds are not only the mo&s;t convenient for early ri&s;ers, but al&s;o the mo&s;t conducive to health. The higher cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety in Ire|land appear to be &s;o well convinced of the &s;alu|brity of this mode of &s;leeping, that their chil|dren, in&s;tead of being placed on enervating feather-beds, are habituated to &s;leep upon bags filled with cut &s;traw, with blankets laid over the bags for &s;oftne&s;s, and but &s;lightly covered. I under&s;tand, that this prai&s;e-wor|thy practice is every day&punc;becoming more general.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="039111_0327_1013A11B66C8B600">
Indeed, there is no doubt that the mu&s;cles and nerves are more braced by a proper ela&s;|tic couch, than either by the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite down of Norway, or the mo&s;t powerful tonic or &s;trengthening remedies taken internally. Yet the&s;e remarks are applicable only to the healthy &s;tate of the body, when Nature re|quires no additional aid or precaution, in managing the organs of per&s;piration&mdash;Every bed ought to be &s;o regulated, that it may &s;lope down imperceptibly towards the feet; and if the particulars before &s;tated be attend|ed to, a healthy per&s;on will never &s;leep too long: he will generally awake in &s;ix hours, feel him&s;elf refre&s;hed, ri&s;e with cheerfulne&s;s, and be fit to undertake any exertions, either of body or mind.</P>
<P>What has been remarked in a former Chapter on Dre&s;s, and the advantages derived from covering the &s;kin with animal wool, particularly in enervated and infirm people, is likewi&s;e applicable here, with re&s;pect to the dre&s;s, and the immediate covering of the &s;kin, when in bed. Though we u&s;ually undre&s;s our&s;elves as far as the &s;hirt, partly for the &s;ake of cleanline&s;s, and partly with the view of re|lieving the body from every pre&s;&s;ure and in|cumbrance, and of promoting a free circula|tion of the blood; yet we &s;hould be cautious, le&s;t we materially hurt our&s;elves by a &s;udden expo&s;ure to the air, when undre&s;&s;ing, e&s;pec|ially after the hot and &s;ultry days of &s;ummer. A long and commodious night-gown of flan|nel would be a proper night dre&s;s; e&s;pecially for tho&s;e who retire to their bed immediately
<PB N="298" REF="039111_0328_1013A15025D3F1D8">
after the bath, in order to pre&s;erve a gentle degree of per&s;piration.</P>
<P>The head &s;hould not be covered with a warm flannel or wor&s;ted night-cap, as it were to make it a vapour-bath; the thinne&s;t cot|ton or linen cap being fully &s;ufficient. The con&s;equences re&s;ulting from the pernicious practice of keeping the head too warm, have been explained on a former occa&s;ion. The &s;hirt-collar &s;hould be loo&s;e, the wri&s;tbands open; and if from a bad habit we have been accu&s;tomed to wear neckcloths during &s;leep, they &s;hould be tied as loo&s;ely as po&s;&s;ible. Per|&s;ons who are naturally chilly in the lower ex|tremities, or are liable to pains of the &s;tomach and abdomen, would do well to &s;leep in wool|len &s;tockings, but not in the &s;ame which they have worn through the day.</P>
<P>The <HI>feather-beds,</HI> in which we u&s;ually &s;leep, are certainly hurtful in many di&s;ea&s;es, &s;ome of which they may even produce. For they ab|&s;orb or imbibe the per&s;pired vapours thrown out of the body, without our being able to clean&s;e them of the&s;e impurities, which are again re-ab&s;orbed and re-conducted through the pores, to the great injury of health. For this rea&s;on, mattre&s;&s;es filled with hor&s;e-hair, or mo&s;s, are in every re&s;pect preferable. But, as many individuals have not &s;ufficient re&s;o|lution to u&s;e the&s;e, or are apprehen&s;ive of the con&s;equences attending a &s;udden change, they may at lea&s;t cau&s;e their feather-beds to be fre|quently and carefully &s;haken, aired in the &s;un, and provided with a new covering. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, the bed ought not to be made
<PB N="299" REF="039111_0329_1013A11F58E94220">
immediately after ri&s;ing, as is generally prac|ti&s;ed; but the clothes &s;hould be taken off, &s;pread out, and not laid on the bed, until the time of going to re&s;t draws near. Far|ther, it is highly improper to &s;leep in beds overloaded with clothes&punc; they heat the blood more than is con&s;i&s;tent with health, and produce an immoderate and enervating per&s;|piration, which &s;till more weakens the organs already relaxed by &s;leep.</P>
<P>The cu&s;tom of &s;leeping with the curtains drawn clo&s;e, is pernicious to health, becau&s;e the copious exhalations which then take place, cannot be properly di&s;&s;ipated, and are con&s;e|quently again ab&s;orbed. It is al&s;o imprudent to hide the head almo&s;t entirely under the bed-clothes. Per&s;ons who cannot &s;leep with|out curtains, &s;hould tuck up the lower ends of them, or place them over chairs, &s;o that they may not lie clo&s;e to the bed, but admit a more free acce&s;s of air; that &s;ide alone, which is next the wall, ought to be entirely covered with the curtain.</P>
<P>For &s;imilar rea&s;ons, the large common &s;leep|ing halls, or wards in public &s;chools, as well as in ho&s;pitals, are extremely prejudicial to health; though they may be nece&s;&s;ary evils, and cannot be ea&s;ily remedied in the great &s;e|minaries of education. Neither the mo&s;t healthy &s;ituation, with high, lofty, and &s;pa|cious apartments; nor the daily practice of airing and cleaning them, are &s;ufficient to counteract the bad effects ari&s;ing from this baneful cu&s;tom of crowding &s;o many per&s;ons together to breathe in a common and con|fined atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="039111_0330_1013A152D1A2B5A0">
From the&s;e con&s;iderations, as well as in ma|ny other re&s;pects, the &s;leeping together in one bed, whether children or adults, is at be&s;t a di&s;gu&s;ting and immoral cu&s;tom; be&s;ides the po&s;itive di&s;advantages it has with re&s;pect to health. Unle&s;s poverty or nece&s;&s;ity render this cu&s;tom unavoidable, it ought not to be practi&s;ed, either among married or other per|&s;ons, and &s;till le&s;s among children. It has been remarked, even in the dome&s;tic econo|my of barbarous nations, that, in general, ev|ery individual has a &s;eparate couch.</P>
<P>The old cu&s;tom of warming the bed al&s;o de&s;erves to be condemned; as it has a direct tendency to produce weakne&s;s and debility. This will be &s;till more dangerous, if it be done with a charcoal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ire, which, by its poi|&s;onous vapours, may prove very pernicious. A per&s;on who is accu&s;tomed to &s;leep in a cold bed, will not feel much inconvenience in the &s;evere&s;t cold; for, after being a &s;hort time in bed, the natural warmth of the body will overcome it: as, on the contrary, tho&s;e who &s;leep in a warmed bed, will be the more lia|ble to feel cold, as &s;oon as this artificial heat is di&s;&s;ipated.</P>
<P>If it can be avoided, the bed-room ought not to be on the ground floor, nor towards the North. Many people prefer this &s;ituation in &s;ummer, on account of the cool air; they &s;hould, however, con&s;ider that, in &s;uch an apartment, the morning as well as the night-air, is damp and unwhole&s;ome. A bed-cham|ber ought to be expo&s;ed to the early rays of the &s;un, which awake man in a &s;tate of health
<PB N="301" REF="039111_0331_1013A120DCCDB3F8">
at a proper time, and enliven, &s;trengthen, and incite him to leave the bed, after having been refre&s;hed by re&s;t. It is, farther, more advi&s;able to endure a moderate degree of heat, which may be modified at plea&s;ure, by vari|ous means, than to inhabit damp and low-&s;it|uated apartments, from which the moi&s;ture cannot be ea&s;ily dried up in &s;ummer.</P>
<P>A &s;pacious and lofty room &s;hould always be cho&s;en for a bed-chamber; for &s;mall clo&s;ets and, above all, concealed beds are extremely objectionable.&mdash;The windows &s;hould never be left open at night; and as damp rooms are very prejudicial to health, we ought to pay particular attention, that the bed may not be placed near a damp wall. It is in every ca&s;e preferable to place the bed &s;o, that all the &s;ides of it &s;tand free. This meth|od of placing the bed&s;tead, in or about the middle of the room, has another advantage which, with timorous per&s;ons, is perhaps of importance. It it well known, that a fla&s;h of lightning, if it accidentally enter through a window, will take its direction along the walls, and not touch any thing placed in the middle of a room.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, no candle or ru&s;h-light &s;hould be kept burning during the night in a bed-room; for it not only vitiates the air in a very con|&s;iderable degree, but it di&s;turbs and prevents the re&s;t of tho&s;e who&s;e &s;leep is unea&s;y, partic|ularly the aged. In a dark apartment, &s;leep generally comes without much invitation;
<PB N="302" REF="039111_0332_1013A15673411BE8">
as, on the other hand, the light of a candle &s;timulates the brain, con&s;equently the whole nervous &s;y&s;tem; and the approaching com|forter, who&s;e arrival we &s;o fondly wi&s;h, is thereby prevented, or ea&s;ily interrupted, and bani&s;hed to calmer regions.</P>

<P>ALTHOUGH it be certain, that animal life could not be &s;upported without food and drink, few individuals give them&s;elves the trouble of reflecting, how the very important function of a&s;&s;imilating our aliment is accom|pli&s;hed. That office of the &s;tomach, by which all living creatures are &s;upported, de&s;erves the attention of every inqui&s;itive mind. Were I not confined in my plan to the relative &s;alubri|ty of Food and Drink, without entering into phy&s;iological di&s;qui&s;itions, how the dige&s;tive organs prepare and conduct the food from one &s;tage to another, till it is converted into chyle, and from that into blood, I might amu&s;e my readers with a variety of &s;peculations and

<P>If, in the early periods of &s;ociety, when men &s;ub&s;i&s;ted upon roots, plants, and animal food, as they were promi&s;cuou&s;ly found, people did not reflect upon the relative &s;alubrity of things, we have no right to cen&s;ure them; as they often might have been &s;tarved, before they could have di&s;covered their qualities.

<P>An ea&s;tern Dervi&s;e was once a&s;ked by a wealthy Mahometan, <Q>Of what &s;ervice to &s;ociety is an order of men, who employ them&s;elves in &s;peculative notions of divinity and medicine?&mdash;If you were more cau|tious and temperate in your meals, an|&s;wered the Dervi&s;e; if you would learn to govern your pa&s;&s;ions and de&s;ires, by a due attention to ab&s;tinence, you all might be &s;ages, and have no occa&s;ion for Dervi&s;es a|mong you.

<P>In the con&s;umption of food and drink we are liable to commit errors, both as to their quan|tity and quality. The error in the quantity, however, is generally the mo&s;t detrimental. A &s;mall portion of food can be better dige&s;ted and more ea&s;ily prepared into chyle, or that alimentary fluid, from which the blood derives its origin, than a large portion of food, which injures the coats of the &s;tomach, and prevents them from exerting their force. Hence every &s;atiety, or &s;uperfluity, is noxious.</P>
<P>It is in infancy, and early age, that the foun|dation is laid for the many di&s;ea&s;es ari&s;ing from indige&s;tion, which are now found in al|mo&s;t every family.

craving for food, which mu&s;t be &s;atis|fied, whatever be the con&s;equence. The&s;e ex|ce&s;&s;ive &s;upplies not only are unnece&s;&s;ary, but produce the mo&s;t &s;erious and fatal di&s;orders. There is a certain relation &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between what is taken in, and what is lo&s;t by the body: if we eat and drink much, we likewi&s;e lo&s;e much, without gaining any more by it, than we might do by moderate meals. For that which affords the alimentary particles, is as it were drowned by the current; and mu&s;cular energy is not only decrea&s;ed, but in a great mea&s;ure de&s;troyed. Yet eating too little would be going to the oppo&s;ite extreme, weaken the growth to bodily perfection, and eventually dimini&s;h the dige&s;tive power of the &s;tomach, by depriving it of its due &s;hare of exerci&s;e and &s;upport.</P>
<P>Nature is ea&s;ily &s;atisfied, and is always be&s;t provided, if we do not intrude upon her more than &s;he is accu&s;tomed to. If we have, for &s;ome time, taken little nouri&s;hment, nature be|comes &s;o habituated to it, that we feel indi&s;po|&s;ed, as &s;oon as the u&s;ual mea&s;ure is tran&s;gre&s;&s;|ed; and both the &s;tomach and its dige&s;tive powers are thereby impaired.</P>
<P>The hardy countryman dige&s;ts the crude and &s;olid food, at which the &s;tomach of the luxu|rious citizen recoils. In order to &s;trengthen the &s;tomach, we ought not to withhold from it what keeps it in proper exerci&s;e. But, for this purpo&s;e, we &s;hould rather improve the quality, than increa&s;e the quantity of alimen|tary &s;ub&s;tances. It is with this organ as with all other parts of the body: the more exerci&s;e
<PB N="17" REF="039111_0340_1013A19BDF2D1058">
we give it, the more &s;trength and vigour it ac|quires. Hence, it is highly improper to leave off eating food of difficult dige&s;tion, as &s;ome people are apt to do; for this is not the way of improving the energy of the body.</P>
<P>It would be a fruitle&s;s and impracticable at|tempt, to lay down fixed rules, by which the re&s;pective &s;alubrity or perniciou&s;ne&s;s of every &s;pecies of aliment might be determined, in its application to the individual.

Hence it may be con&s;idered as a general rule, that all incon|gruous mixtures and compo&s;itions, for in&s;tance milk and vinegar or other acids, or milk and &s;pirits, are hurtful, by generating an acid and acrid whey in the &s;tomach, and at the &s;ame time producing an indige&s;tible coagulated ma&s;s.</P>

This indeed but too often happens. One who eats &s;lowly,

<P>The general rule then is, <HI>to eat as much as is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upply the wa&s;te &s;uffered by the body;</HI> if we tran&s;gre&s;s this mea&s;ure, we produce too much <HI>blood;</HI> a circum&s;tance as detrimental, though not &s;o dangerous to life, as that of having too little. If we were never to tre&s;|pa&s;s the due limits of temperance, our natural appetite would be able accurately to deter|mine, how much food we might con&s;ume, without dimini&s;hing our vivacity. But, from the u&s;ual phy&s;ical education of children, this can &s;carcely be expected in adults. We ought therefore to pay &s;trict attention to the &s;tate of tho&s;e inte&s;tines, which &s;erve to prepare the ali|mentary fluid; and when the&s;e are in a relax|ed or di&s;ea&s;ed &s;tate, we &s;hould in&s;tantly begin to be more moderate in eating.</P>

If after dinner we feel our&s;elves as cheerful as before it, we may be a&s;&s;ured, that we have taken a <HI>diet|etical</HI> meal. For, if the proper mea&s;ure be ex|ceeded, torpor and relaxation will be the ne|ce&s;&s;ary con&s;equence; our faculty of dige&s;tion will be impaired, and a variety of complaints gradually induced.</P>
<P>The &s;tomach being di&s;tended by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">uent and violent exertions, will not re&s;t &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">fied with the former quantity of food;&mdash;its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> will increa&s;e with indulgence in exce&s;s; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> temperance alone can reduce it to its natu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> &s;tate, and re&s;tore its ela&s;ticity.

<P>A healthy appetite is al&s;o determined by the &s;ea&s;on, to the influence of which the &s;tomach is expo&s;ed, in common with the other vi&s;cera. Hence heat, in general, relaxes and exhau&s;ts the body, from its tendency to di&s;&s;ipate the flu|ids, or to dimini&s;h their quantity; and con&s;e|quently the &s;tomach cannot dige&s;t the &s;ame portion of food in &s;ummer, which it does in winter. There are however per&s;ons, who have the &s;tronge&s;t appetite, and po&s;&s;e&s;s the mo&s;t vigorous dige&s;tive powers, in the extreme heat of &s;ummer.

We call tho&s;e &s;ub&s;tances <HI>nutritive,</HI> which re|&s;tore and &s;upply what has been wa&s;ted. They conduct to the body homogeneous or a&s;&s;imi|lated parts, by means of the inte&s;tinal canal, and by changing the&s;e parts into mu&s;cular &s;ub&s;tance or fle&s;h, or into the fluid form of blood. Since &s;ome alimentary articles com|municate their nutritive element &s;ooner than others, as they contain coar&s;er or more delicate particles, which according to their nature are more or le&s;s apt to be a&s;&s;imilated with the body, it follows, that all of them cannot be equally nouri&s;hing.</P>
<P>Too little aliment debilitates the body, which thereby acquires le&s;s than it lo&s;es by re&s;piration; it ha&s;tens the con&s;umption of life; the blood becomes inert and rarefied; or is rendered acrid and liable to putrefaction.

<P N="2">2. <HI>As to the quality of aliment,</HI> we mu&s;t here inve&s;tigate the nature of <HI>Dige&s;tion.</HI> This func|tion may be aptly divided into two different&punc; proce&s;&s;es: <HI>Solution</HI> and <HI>A&s;&s;imilation.</HI> Solution takes place in the &s;tomach, where the food is changed into a pulp, where it is di&s;&s;olved ac|cording to its greater or le&s;s &s;olubility, and where its nouri&s;hing particles are ab&s;orbed. A&s;&s;imilation only begins, when the &s;olution has already taken place in the &s;tomach, when the nutritive &s;ub&s;tance, or the alimentary juice, is inhaled by the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, and con|ducted to the blood, by means of the lacteals. A&s;&s;imilation, therefore, is that function, by which the aliment is as it were animalized: and hence it has been conjectured, that animal food is ea&s;ier dige&s;ted than vegetable, as being more analogous to our nature, and more ea&s;ily converted into animal fluids.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="039111_0346_1013A1A38E1FEBC8">
There are articles of ea&s;y and of difficult di|ge&s;tion, in the animal as well as in the vegeta|ble kingdom: in both we find &s;ome &s;ub&s;tances, which are completely indige&s;tible, and which pa&s;s through the alimentary canal, without af|fording any nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P><HI>The mo&s;t &s;imple di&s;hes are the mo&s;t nouri&s;hing.</HI> The multiplied combinations of &s;ub&s;tances, though they may plea&s;e the palate, are not con|ducive to health. All &s;ub&s;tances containing much jelly, whether animal or vegetable, are nouri&s;hing; for this alone affords nutriment; and the hard, watery, and &s;aline particles of food cannot be a&s;&s;imilated or converted into chyle. Nouri&s;hing &s;ub&s;tances would, indeed, be more conformable to Nature; but, as our appetite generally incites us to eat &s;omewhat more than is nece&s;&s;ary, we &s;hould acquire too much alimentary matter, and become too full of blood, if we were to choo&s;e only &s;uch articles of food as contain a great quantity of jelly.</P>
<P>Dr. BUCHAN very ju&s;tly ob&s;erves, that <Q>the great art of preparing food is to blend the nutritive part of the aliment with a &s;ufficient quantity of &s;ome light farinaceous &s;ub&s;tance, in order to fill up the canal, without over|charging it with more nutritious particles than are nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of the ani|mal. This may be done either by bread or other farinaceous &s;ub&s;tances, of which there is a great variety.</Q> Tho&s;e, who are not employed in hard labour or exerci&s;e, do not require &s;uch nouri&s;hing food as tho&s;e, who&s;e nutritive fluids are in part con&s;umed by mu&s;|cular exertions and violent per&s;piration.

Such as have &s;uffered frequent lo&s;&s;es of blood, from whatever cau&s;e, will be&s;t re&s;tore it by &s;trong aliment; which, on the contrary, ought to be avoided by the plethoric.

<P>Whether we ought to make u&s;e of articles of ea&s;y or difficult dige&s;tion, cannot be deter|mined by general rules: every per&s;on mu&s;t attend to the effects, which &s;ub&s;tances of dif|ferent degrees of dige&s;tibility produce on his &s;tomach. The chyle, when prepared of &s;ub|&s;tances not ea&s;ily dige&s;tible, is &s;olid and con|centrated, and con&s;equently affords a &s;ub&s;tan|tial mu&s;cular fibre&punc; but &s;uch &s;ub&s;tances as the &s;tomach cannot dige&s;t, ought never to be u&s;ed as food.</P>
<P>It is an important rule of diet, <HI>to eat if po&s;|&s;ible of one kind of meat only,</HI> or, at all events, <HI>to eat of that di&s;h fir&s;t which is the mo&s;t palata|ble.</HI> The &s;tomach is enabled to prepare the be&s;t chyle from &s;imple &s;ub&s;tances, and will thence produce the mo&s;t healthy fluids. And if we follow the &s;econd part of this rule, we are in no danger of overloading the &s;tomach. At a table dietetically arranged, we ought to begin with tho&s;e di&s;hes which are mo&s;t diffi|cult to be dige&s;ted, and fini&s;h our meal with the mo&s;t ea&s;y; becau&s;e the former require &s;tronger dige&s;tive powers, and more bile and &s;aliva, all of which become defective towards the end of a heavy meal.

<P>To begin meals, as the French, Germans, and Scots generally do, with <HI>&s;oups</HI> or <HI>broths,</HI> is highly improper and noxious.

Every ten&s;ion is attended with relaxation, &s;o that we imagine our&s;elves &s;atisfied &s;ooner than we are in reality. Be&s;ides, broths and &s;oups require little dige&s;tion, weaken the &s;tomach, and are attended with all the pernicious effects of oth|er warm and relaxing drinks.

<P>Many individuals are accu&s;tomed to &s;pend the whole forenoon without breakfa&s;t, and feel no inconvenience from it, while others of a more delicate &s;tomach could not bear &s;uch ab&s;tinence, without unavoidable cravings and debility. The bu&s;ine&s;s of dige&s;tion is u&s;ually accompli&s;hed within three or four hours after a meal; hence the &s;tomach is empty at ri&s;ing in the morning, and the body often enfeebled by long fa&s;ting.

We &s;hould breakfa&s;t &s;oon after we get up, dine about mid-day, and not pro|tract the hour of &s;upper till the time which Nature points out for re&s;t.</P>
<P>A principal rule of diet is to take food with an ea&s;y and &s;erene mind; hence it is prefera|ble to dine or &s;up in company: our food has thus more reli&s;h, it agrees better with us, and we eat more &s;lowly and cheerfully. But we ought not to indulge our&s;elves in &s;itting too long at table, which is a ways pernicious to health. For dige&s;tion takes place, even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> we &s;it at table; and as the &s;tomach, when gradually &s;upplied, craves for additional quan|tities of food, e&s;pecially when a variety of pal|atable di&s;hes &s;timulates the appetite, we ought to be much on our guard again&s;t the&s;e &s;educ|tions.

<P>Gentle exerci&s;e, before dinner or &s;upper, is very conducive to increa&s;e our appetite, by pro|moting the circulation of the blood. But too violent exerci&s;e impairs the appetite, and weakens the powers of the &s;tomach, by means of its &s;ympathy with the other parts of the body. In proof of this, we &s;eldom &s;ee peo|ple

worn out with fatigue able to partake of their u&s;ual repa&s;ts. The exerci&s;e, however gentle, ought to be over at lea&s;t half an hour before dinner; becau&s;e it is hurtful to &s;it down to table immediately after great fatigue.</P>
<P>As to our conduct <HI>after dinner,</HI> it is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to give rules that are generally appli|cable, and much le&s;s &s;o to every individual. From the contradictory opinion of the mo&s;t e&s;teemed authors, they appear not to have di&s;criminated between the various &s;tates and conditions of animal life; and as exerci&s;e was found to agree with &s;ome con&s;titutions, and to di&s;agree with others, a diver&s;ity of opinions nece&s;&s;arily aro&s;e among tho&s;e who were &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately fond of reducing every thing to general rules. In order then to remove the&s;e difficulties, I think it nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that though it be apparently con&s;i&s;tent with the in&s;tinct of nature to re&s;t &s;ome time after dinner, according to the example of ani|mals, yet this time, as well as other concur|rent circum&s;tances, de&s;erves to be more pre|ci&s;ely determined.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the food has entered the &s;tom|ach, the important office of dige&s;tion begins: the vigour of the organs exerted on this occa|&s;ion ought certainly not to be abridged by vio|lent exerci&s;e; but mu&s;cular and robu&s;t people feel no inconvenience from gentle motion about <HI>one</HI> hour after the heavie&s;t meal. On the con|trary, it is highly probable that the abdominal mu&s;cles receive additional impetus, by exer|tions of a moderate kind. But as the whole proce&s;s of dige&s;tion is of much longer duration
<PB N="28" REF="039111_0351_1013A16A15BF90E0">
than is generally imagined, the afternoon hours cannot be employed advantageou&s;ly to health, in any labor requiring &s;trong exer|tions.</P>
<P>The tran&s;ition of the alimentary fluid into blood, which takes place in the third or fourth hour after a meal, and in &s;ome people of a weak and &s;low dige&s;tion much later, is always attended with &s;ome increa&s;e of irritability, which, in per&s;ons of great &s;en&s;ibility, may de|generate into a painful &s;en&s;ation or illne&s;s. At this time, therefore, nervous and hypochon|driac per&s;ons are frequently troubled with their u&s;ual paroxy&s;ms; they are &s;eized with angui&s;h, oppre&s;&s;ion, and an inclination to faint, without any external cau&s;e. Per&s;ons in this condition of body, as well as all febrile patients, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e who are troubled with &s;tomachic complaints, would act ex|tremely wrong and imprudent, to undertake any exerci&s;e whatever, before their victuals be completely dige&s;ted; as during dige&s;tion all the fluids collect towards the &s;tomach. In violent exerci&s;e, or in an increa&s;ed &s;tate of per&s;piration, the fluids are forced to the ex|ternal parts, and withdrawn from the &s;tomach, where they are indi&s;pen&s;able to a&s;&s;i&s;t the proper concoction.</P>
<P>As to the propriety of <HI>&s;leeping after dinner,</HI> we may learn from tho&s;e animals, which &s;leep after feeding, that a little indulgence of this kind cannot be hurtful. Yet this again can|not be e&s;tabli&s;hed as a general rule among men. For the animals which &s;leep after food, are for the mo&s;t part &s;upplied with articles of
<PB N="29" REF="039111_0352_1013A1AB77EF5218">
&s;o very difficult dige&s;tion, and &s;o hard in their nature, that great dige&s;tive powers are required to convert them into alimentary matter. Hence this practice can be recommended only to the nervous and debilitated, to weakly per&s;ons in general, who are much employed in mental exerci&s;e, and are pa&s;t the middle age&mdash;e&s;|pecially after a heavy meal, in hot weather, and warm climates.</P>
<P>Experience, however, teaches us, that, in this re&s;pect, a &s;hort &s;leep, of a few minutes only, is &s;ufficient and preferable to one of longer duration; for, in the latter ca&s;e, we lo&s;e more by an increa&s;e of in&s;en&s;ible per&s;pira|tion, than is conducive to dige&s;tion.&mdash;But the po&s;ition of the body is far from being a matter of indifference. The be&s;t is a reclined and not a horizontal po&s;ture, from which head-ach may ea&s;ily&punc; ari&s;e, when the &s;tomach pre&s;&s;es upon the &s;ubjacent inte&s;tines, and the blood is thereby impelled to the head. The old practice of &s;tanding or walking after dinner is &s;o far improper, as it is hurtful to take exerci&s;e, while the &s;tomach is di&s;tended by food, the &s;en&s;ation of which la&s;ts at lea&s;t for one hour.</P>
<P>In the primitive ages, people &s;ub&s;i&s;ted chiefly upon plants and fruits. Even to this day, many &s;ects and whole nations, the Bra|mins for in&s;tance, ab&s;tain from the u&s;e of an|imal food. The ancient Germans, al&s;o, who were &s;o renowned for their bodily &s;trength, lived upon acorns, wood apples, four milk, and other productions of their then unculti|vated &s;oil. In the pre&s;ent mode of life, here as well as on the Continent, a great propor|tion
<PB N="30" REF="039111_0353_1013A16DA3909188">
of the poorer cla&s;s of country-people &s;ub|&s;i&s;t chiefly on vegetables; but although they duly dige&s;t their vegetable aliment, and be|come vigorous, yet it is certain, that animal food would an&s;wer the&s;e purpo&s;es much better. Hence in countries where the labouring cla&s;s of people live principally upon animal food, they far excel in bodily &s;trength and duration of life.</P>
<P>A popular writer ob&s;erves, that <Q>ani|mal food is le&s;s adapted to the &s;edentary than the laborious, who&s;e diet ought to con&s;i&s;t chiefly of vegetables. In|dulging in animal food renders men dull and unfit for the pur&s;uits of &s;cience, e&s;pe|cially when it is accompanied with the free u&s;e of &s;trong liquors.</Q> This is &s;o far true, but Dr. Buchan ought to have added, that the infirm, and tho&s;e who labour under complaints of indige&s;tion, will &s;uffer &s;till more from the u&s;e of vegetable &s;ub&s;tances, which by their pe|culiar nature produce too much acid, and re|quire &s;tronger dige&s;tive organs, in order to be changed into a good alimentary fluid.</P>
<P>Dr. Buchan farther ob&s;erves, that <Q>con|&s;umptions &s;o common in England, are in part owing to the great u&s;e of animal food.</Q> To this a&s;&s;ertion no one will give his a&s;&s;ent, who is acquainted with that cla&s;s of men, who carry on the bu&s;ine&s;s of butchers, among whom it is as rare to hear of a con&s;umptive per&s;on, as it is to find a &s;ailor troubled with the hypochondria&s;is. I mu&s;t quote another ob&s;ervation of this gentleman, to which I cannot implicitly &s;ub&s;cribe. Having remark|ed,
<PB N="31" REF="039111_0354_1013A1AE07AD02F8">
that the mo&s;t common di&s;ea&s;e in this coun|try is the &s;curvy; that we find a taint of it in almo&s;t every family, and in &s;ome a very deep taint, he &s;ays,&mdash;<Q>that a di&s;ea&s;e &s;o general mu&s;t have a <HI>general cau&s;e,</HI> and there is <HI>none &s;o obvious,</HI> as the great quantity of animal food devoured by the natives. As a proof, that &s;curvy ari&s;es from this cau&s;e, we are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of no remedy for that di&s;ea&s;e equal to the free u&s;e of fre&s;h vegetables.</Q> He likewi&s;e remarks, <Q>that the choleric di&s;po|&s;ition of the Engli&s;h is almo&s;t proverbial, and if he were to a&s;&s;ign a cau&s;e of it, it would be their living &s;o much on animal food;</Q> and finally, that <Q>there is no doubt but this induces a ferocity of temper un|known to men, who&s;e food is chiefly taken from the vegetable kingdom.</Q></P>
<P>There is much truth mingled with much fallacy in the&s;e a&s;&s;ertions. I will allow, that animal food predi&s;po&s;es people to &s;corbutic complaints, and that it renders men more bold and &s;anguinary in their temper; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> there are a variety of other cau&s;es which produce a &s;im|ilar effect. Nor are the Engli&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> choleric a people as the Italians and Tur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s, both of whom, though &s;paring in the u&s;e of animal food, are uncommonly vindictive. It is farther not to be imputed to the con&s;umption of fle&s;h|meat, or the want of vegetables alone, that the &s;curvy is &s;o frequent in this country, both on land and at &s;ea. There appears to me to exi&s;t a powerful cau&s;e, to which people pay very little attention, and from which the &s;curvy more frequently derives its origin than from
<PB N="32" REF="039111_0355_1013A170320E7400">
any other; the difference of food being in fact only a concurrent cau&s;e.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider the very &s;udden and frequent changes of temperature in our climate; if we compare the pre&s;ent mode of living with that of our ance&s;tors, who did not interrupt the di|ge&s;tion of one meal by another, &s;uch as our rich luncheons in the forenoon, and our tea and coffee in the afternoon, when the dige&s;tive organs are, as it were, drowned in the&s;e favour|ite liquids;&mdash;if, farther, we reflect upon the irregular manner in which our time of repo&s;e is arranged, &s;o that we &s;pend a great part of our life in the unwhole&s;ome night-air, partly at late &s;uppers, and partly in the modern practice of travelling at night;&mdash;if all the&s;e cricum&s;tanc|es be duly weighed, we cannot be at a lo&s;s to di&s;|cover a more general cau&s;e of &s;corbutic com|plaints, than that of eating too much animal food.</P>
<P>After the&s;e reflections, it will not be diffi|cult to comprehend, that the mo&s;t important of the human functions is materially injured, by the&s;e habitual irregularities. I allude to the <HI>in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration</HI> which is &s;o far from being encouraged and &s;upported by &s;uch conduct, that the noxious particles, which ought to be evaporated, are daily and hourly repelled, a|gain ab&s;orbed by the lacteals, and reconducted to the ma&s;s of the circulating fluids. Here they can produce no other effect than that of tainting the humours with acrimonious par|ticles, and di&s;po&s;ing them to a &s;tate of putre&s;|cency and di&s;&s;olution, which is the leading &s;ymptom of &s;curvy. Upon the minute&s;t in|quiries among &s;ea-faring people, as well as the
<PB N="33" REF="039111_0356_1013A1B10C0E1EE0">
inhabitants of the country, I have been in|formed, that tho&s;e individuals, who pay due attention to the &s;tate of their &s;kin, by wearing flannel &s;hirts and wor&s;ted &s;tockings, and by not expo&s;ing them&s;elves too often to night-air, or other irregularities, are &s;eldom, if ever, trou|bled with &s;curvy.</P>
<P>To return to the &s;ubject of animal food and its effects, it de&s;erves to be remarked, that a too frequent and exce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of it di&s;po&s;es the fluids to putrefaction, and, I believe in &s;ome &s;anguine temperaments, communicates to the mind a degree of ferocity. Nations living chiefly upon the fle&s;h of animals, like the Tar|tars, are in general more fierce than others; and the &s;ame effect is manife&s;t in carnivorous animals: they emit a very di&s;agreeable &s;mell, and both their fle&s;h and milk has an unplea&s;ant and di&s;gu&s;ting ta&s;te. Even a child will refu&s;e the brea&s;t, when its nur&s;e has eaten too much animal food. Tho&s;e who eat great quantities of meat, and little bread or vegetables, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily acquire an offen&s;ive breath. It ap|pears, therefore, to be mo&s;t &s;uitable and con|ducive to health, to combine animal with vege|table food, in due proportions. This cannot be minutely a&s;certained, with re&s;pect to every individual; but, in general, two thirds or three fourths of vegetables, to one third or fourth part of meat, appears to be the mo&s;t proper. By this judicious mixture, we may avoid the di&s;ea&s;es ari&s;ing from a too copious u&s;e of either. Much, however, depends on the peculiar prop|erties of alimentary &s;ub&s;tances, belonging to one or the other of the different cla&s;&s;es, which we have now to inve&s;tigate.</P>

<HEAD>Of Animal Food.</HEAD>
<P>It may &s;erve as a preliminary rule, that <HI>fre&s;h meat</HI> is the mo&s;t whole&s;ome and nouri&s;hing. To pre&s;erve the&s;e qualities, however, it ought to be dre&s;&s;ed &s;o as to remain tender and juicy; for by this means it will be ea&s;ily dige&s;ted, and afford mo&s;t nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>The fle&s;h of <HI>tame</HI> animals is, upon the whole, preferable to <HI>game;</HI> and although the latter be, in general, more mellow, and ea&s;ier of dige&s;|tion, it does not contain the &s;weet jelly, and mild juices, with which the former is almo&s;t uniformly impregnated.</P>
<P>By the u&s;ual mode of dre&s;&s;ing victuals, they lo&s;e a con&s;iderable part of their nutritious qual|ity, and become thereby le&s;s dige&s;tible. <HI>Raw meat</HI> certainly contains the pure&s;t and mo&s;t nouri&s;hing juice. We do not, however, eat raw fle&s;h, but there are &s;ome &s;ub&s;tances which are frequently con&s;umed in a &s;tate nearly ap|proaching to that of rawne&s;s. Such are the We&s;tphalia hams, Italian &s;au&s;ages, &s;moked gee&s;e, &s;alted herrings, and the like.</P>
<P>Various modes of preparing and dre&s;&s;ing meat have been contrived, to render it more palatable, and better adapted to the &s;tomach. By expo&s;ure to the air, fle&s;h becomes more &s;oft, which obviou&s;ly is the effect of incipient putrefaction; for, by this proce&s;s, the volatile particles of ammoniacal &s;alt are di&s;engaged, and it is rendered more agreeable to the ta&s;te.

Pickled and &s;moked meats,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is remarkable, that <HI>&s;moked meat</HI> is more readily dige&s;ted in a <HI>raw</HI> than boiled &s;tate. Experience affords ample proof of this a&s;&s;ertion, e&s;pecially in the articles of &s;moked hams and &s;au&s;ages; for the &s;oft gelatinous fluids which, by the joint proce&s;&s;es of pick|ling and &s;moking, have been effectually decompo&s;ed, or converted into a neutral &s;ub&s;tance con&s;i&s;ting of ammoniacal &s;alt combined with animal jelly, are completely extracted by boiling, &s;o that lit|tle more than the dry fle&s;hy fibres remain behind.</NOTE> &s;o commonly u&s;ed in the northern and ea&s;tern countries of Eu|rope, acquire an unnatural hardne&s;s, and com|municate a great degree of acrimony to the flu|ids of the human body. By <HI>boiling,</HI> fle&s;h is de|prived of its nouri&s;hing juice, as the gelatinous &s;ub&s;tance of the meat is extracted, and incor|porated in the broth; and it is thus converted into a le&s;s nutritive and more oppre&s;&s;ive bur|den for the dige&s;tive organs; becau&s;e the &s;pirituous and bal&s;amic particles are too much evaporated during the boiling. The <HI>broth</HI> indeed contains the mo&s;t nouri&s;hing part of it, but it is too much diluted to admit of an ea&s;y dige&s;tion. A better mode of dre&s;&s;ing meat is <HI>roa&s;ting,</HI> by which its &s;trength is le&s;s wa&s;ted, and the &s;pirituous particles prevented from evaporating; a cru&s;t is &s;oon formed on its &s;urface, and the nutritive principle better pre|&s;erved. Hence, one pound of roa&s;ted meat is, in actual nouri&s;hment, equal to two or three pounds of boiled meat.</P>
<P>The boiling of animal food is frequently per|formed in open ve&s;&s;els; which is not the be&s;t method of rendering it tender, palatable, and nouri&s;hing: clo&s;e ve&s;&s;els only ought to be u&s;ed for that purpo&s;e.

<PB N="36" REF="039111_0359_1013A17460C0F6C8">
and to concentrate the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial parts of animal food.</P>
<P>When we expo&s;e articles of provi&s;ion to the fire, without any addition of moi&s;ture, it is call|ed <HI>baking.</HI> That &s;uch articles may not be too much dried by evaporation, they are u&s;ually covered with pa&s;te. Thus the meat, indeed, re|tains all its nutritive particles, becomes tender and ea&s;ily dige&s;tible; but the pa&s;te is the more detrimental to the &s;tomach, as it generally con|&s;i&s;ts of an undue proportion of butter, which cannot be readily dige&s;ted in that &s;tate. When meat is <HI>fried,</HI> it is in &s;ome degree deprived of its &s;ub&s;tance; but, if the fire be &s;trong enough, a &s;olid cru&s;t will &s;oon be formed on its &s;urface, by which the evaporation will be checked, and the fle&s;h rendered mellow: the butter, or other fat u&s;ed to prevent its adherence to the pan, gives it a burnt or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> ta&s;te, and renders its dige&s;tion in the &s;tomach rather difficult.</P>
<P>Vegetables are, in general, not &s;o readily di|ge&s;ted, as even hard and tough animal &s;ub|&s;tances; which from their nature are more &s;peedily a&s;&s;imilated to the body; but the fle&s;h of young animals, with a proportionate quan|tity of whole&s;ome vegetables, is the diet be&s;t adapted to our &s;y&s;tem. The fle&s;h of fattened cattle is by no means whole&s;ome; the&s;e ani|mals lead a &s;luggi&s;h and inactive life, and as they are &s;urrounded in their dungeons by a bad and putrid air, they con&s;equently do not afford fluids &s;alutary for the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>Though fat meat is more nouri&s;hing than lean, fat being the cellular &s;ub&s;tance of animal

jelly, yet to dige&s;t this oily matter, there is re|quired, on account of its difficult &s;olubility, a good bile, much &s;aliva, and a vigorous &s;tom|ach. To prevent any bad effects, we ought to u&s;e a &s;ufficient quantity of &s;alt, which is an excellent &s;olvent of fat, and changes it into a &s;aponaceous ma&s;s.</P>
<P>Luxury has introduced an unnatural ope|ration, which makes the fle&s;h of certain ani|mals at once delicate and nutritious; but the fle&s;h of the &s;ame animals is &s;till more whole|&s;ome in their unmutilated &s;tate, before they have been &s;uffered to copulate. The mucil|aginous and gelatinous parts of animals alone afford nouri&s;hment; and according to the pro|portion of the&s;e contained in the meat, it is more or le&s;s nouri&s;hing. We find mucilage to be a principal con&s;tituent in vegetable, and jelly or gluten in animal bodies: hence far|inaceous &s;ub&s;tances contain the mo&s;t of the former, and the fle&s;h of animals mo&s;t of the latter. A &s;ub&s;tantial jelly, as for in&s;tance that of calf's feet, is more nouri&s;hing than a thin chicken broth; but it is more difficult to be dige&s;ted.</P>
<P>In &s;ummer, it is advi&s;able to increa&s;e the proportion of vegetable food, and to make u&s;e of acids, &s;uch as vinegar, lemons, oranges, and the like; the blood being in that &s;ea&s;on much di&s;po&s;ed to putre&s;ency. The man who contin|ually takes nouri&s;hing food, is liable to become fat and plethoric; while on the contrary the par&s;imonious, or the religious fanatic, from their ab&s;tinence, become thin and enfeebled: hence the medium, or a proper mixture of both

vegetable and animal nutriment, &s;eems to be mo&s;t conducive to health. I cannot &s;ufficient|ly recommend the following caution to tho&s;e who are frequently troubled with a craving appetite: the more food the &s;tomach demands, it ought to be the more &s;paringly furni&s;hed with &s;trongly nouri&s;hing &s;ub&s;tances, in order to avoid obe&s;ity, or fatne&s;s; and much vegetable food is in this ca&s;e required, to counteract that di&s;po&s;ition to putre&s;cency, which the frequent eating of nutritive &s;ub&s;tances nece&s;&s;arily occa|&s;ions.</P>
<P>There are people who feel the &s;en&s;ation of hunger in a painful degree, which generally ari&s;es from too much acid being generated in the &s;tomach. A vegetable diet would be prej|udicial to &s;uch individuals; they ought to in|crea&s;e the proportion of animal food; and di&s;hes containing oily &s;ub&s;tances, in general, agree well with them. Bread and butter is u&s;eful to &s;uch per&s;ons, in order to neutralize their acid acrimony, and at the &s;ame time, to change the fat into a more &s;oluble &s;aponaceous &s;ub&s;tance. The cau&s;e of this acid is frequent|ly a weakne&s;s in the &s;tomach, which cannot be cured in any other manner, than by &s;trengthening bitters, and articles of nouri&s;h|ment that are mildly a&s;tringent, and promote warmth in the inte&s;tines; and in this re&s;pect, cold meat, as well as drink, is preferable to hot.</P>
<P>The jelly of animals being the very &s;ub|&s;tance, which renovates the &s;olid parts, is ob|viou&s;ly &s;erviceable and nece&s;&s;ary to nouri&s;h the human body. As, however, each kind of an|imal

has its peculiar jelly and fat, which can be nouri&s;hing only when a&s;&s;imilated to our na|ture by the dige&s;tive organs; and as the differ|ent parts of animals require different degrees of dige&s;tion, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to enter into more minute inquiries, re&s;pecting the&s;e par|ticulars.</P>
<P>Experience informs us, that the fle&s;h and inte&s;tines of young animals afford a thin, ea&s;i|ly dige&s;tible, and nutritive jelly. Old ani|mals, hard and tough fle&s;h, cartilages, &s;inews, ligaments, membranes, membranous thick in|te&s;tines, and the &s;inewy parts of the legs, pro|duce a &s;trong and vi&s;cid jelly, which is diffi|cult to be dige&s;ted and a&s;&s;imilated to our flu|ids. The more healthy the animal is, the &s;tronger will be the jelly, and the more nour|i&s;hing its fluids. The mo&s;t nutritious fle&s;h is that of animals living in the open air, having much exerci&s;e and a copious ma&s;s of blood, and particularly, if they are kept in dry and warm places. The alkali contained in the fle&s;h of carnivorous animals is the cau&s;e of the bad nouri&s;hment it affords, and of the injurious con&s;equences attending its u&s;e. From the &s;imilarity in the &s;tructure of quadrupeds to that of man, it may be conjectured, that their jelly is &s;imilar to ours; that &s;uch as are fed upon milk give the be&s;t nouri&s;hment; and that the fle&s;h of female animals is more ea&s;ily dige&s;ted, but le&s;s nutritious than that of the ca&s;trated males, which in every re&s;pect de&s;erves the preference. After quadrupeds, we may cla&s;s birds, in point of nouri&s;hment; then fi&s;hes; next to them amphibious animals; and la&s;tly in&s;ects.</P>

The activity and courage of carnivo|rous animals prove, that the feeding upon fle&s;h gives &s;pirit and &s;trength, heats the body, and pre&s;erves the mu&s;cles in a lively &s;tate. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, much animal food is improper for tho&s;e of a full habit and abundance of blood, for febrile patients, and tho&s;e who are di&s;po&s;ed to hemorrhages or lo&s;&s;es of blood. The phlegmatic, on the contrary, and tho&s;e of thin watery fluids, and a weak dige&s;tion, may with &s;afety eat more animal than vegetable food.&mdash;Of the different kinds of fle&s;h, game is mo&s;t heating; that of young dome&s;tic ani|mals lea&s;t; for in&s;tance, of calves and chickens, particularly when they are eaten with vegetable &s;ub&s;tances containing an acid, &s;uch as &s;orrel, a&s;paragus, &amp;c. That animal food di&s;po&s;es to putre&s;cency, I have before re|marked; hence it ought to be &s;paringly u&s;ed in &s;ummer, and in hot climates. Per&s;ons, who&s;e fluids already &s;how a putrid tendency, and who are reminded of it by frequent erup|tions of the &s;kin, or who are already corpulent, &s;hould ab&s;tain from a too copious u&s;e of ani|mal food.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o ob&s;erved, that the fle&s;h of carnivo|rous animals has an extraordinary tendency to putrefaction, as is obvious from their fetid per|&s;piration; that it contains an acrimony and al|kale&s;cency foreign to our nature; and that it does not afford mild nutriment. The fle&s;h of gra|nivorous animals, partaking more of the vegeta|ble

principle, is le&s;s &s;ubject to putrefaction; and though it be le&s;s nouri&s;hing, and le&s;s abounding in &s;pirituous particles than that of the former, yet it &s;upplies us with a milder and more congenial aliment.</P>
<P>The fle&s;h of fi&s;hes, being, like the element in which they live, mo&s;t di&s;tinct from the nature of man, is of all others the lea&s;t whole|&s;ome and nutritive.</P>
<P>The tame quadrupeds that &s;uck the moth|er's milk, if they re&s;t too much and are quick|ly fed, do not afford a good and well-prepared food. In animals, which have tender mu&s;|cles and little exerci&s;e, tho&s;e parts are probably the mo&s;t whole&s;ome which are more in motion than others, &s;uch as the legs and head.</P>
<P>Poultry furni&s;hes us with the mo&s;t valuable aliment, as it has excellent and well-dige&s;ted fluids, from its more frequent exerci&s;e and con&s;tant re&s;idence in the open and pure air. Some animals, when young, have tough and &s;pongy fle&s;h, which is mollified and improved by age, and can be eaten only after a certain time, &s;uch as eels and carp. Others are hard when young, and mu&s;t be u&s;ed early, becau&s;e that hardne&s;s increa&s;es with their age; as the haddoc, and many other &s;pecies of fi&s;h. The fle&s;h of old animals, that have le&s;s mu&s;cular parts than the young ones of the &s;ame &s;pe|cies, is indige&s;tible; and we may lay it down as a general rule, that the more the fle&s;h of an animal is di&s;po&s;ed to putrefaction, it is the more unwhole&s;ome.</P>
<P><HI>Veal,</HI> although affording le&s;s nutriment than the fle&s;h of the &s;ame animal in a &s;tate of ma|turity,

contains many nouri&s;hing and earthy particles, and produces little or no di&s;po&s;ition to flatulency: it ought, however, not to be brought to market, till the calf is at lea&s;t &s;ix weeks old, and fed, if po&s;&s;ible, on the mother's milk. Veal is not of a heating nature, and may therefore be allowed to febrile patients in a very weak &s;tate, e&s;pecially with the addition of &s;ome acid;&mdash;it is al&s;o the mo&s;t proper food for per&s;ons who have a di&s;po&s;ition to hemorrha|ges. On account of the great proportion it contains of vi&s;cidity, per&s;ons di&s;po&s;ed to phlegm and complaints of the abdomen, ought to ab|&s;tain from its u&s;e. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, we rec|ommend veal-broth, e&s;pecially in pectoral and inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es. The lungs, the liver, and the tongue of veal, are le&s;s vi&s;cous than the fle&s;h; and being ea&s;ily dige&s;ted, &s;oft, and mild, they are very proper for &s;ick per&s;ons and convale&s;cents. No animal fat is lighter than this; it &s;hows the lea&s;t di&s;po&s;ition to putre&s;|cency; and it may therefore be u&s;ed, in pref|erence to any other, by per&s;ons of a &s;corbutic taint. The fat of veal &s;hould not be boiled; the operation of boiling &s;oftens its fibres too much, di&s;&s;olves the jelly, and renders it unfit for dige&s;tion. But, by roa&s;ting, it becomes drier, and &s;omewhat more &s;olid; both the &s;e|rous and thick parts of the blood are incra&s;&s;ated in the external ve&s;&s;els, the fibres are dried up, and a cru&s;t is formed, beneath which the flu|ids are moved, and changed into vapour, by the continued application of heat. In this op|eration all the fibres lie, as it were, in a vapour|hath, and are perfectly &s;oftened without lo&s;ing
<PB N="43" REF="039111_0366_1013A1BEF91B1C30">
any of the jelly. Roa&s;ting, therefore, may be con&s;idered as the be&s;t mode of preparing this meat. Baking al&s;o forms a cru&s;t over it like roa&s;ting, but the fat incra&s;&s;ated by heat may occa&s;ion inconvenience, as it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es an oily acrimony, and is with difficulty dige&s;ted. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, it is improper to eat the burnt cru&s;t of any meat, of which &s;ome people are particularly fond, though it contains an empy|reumatic oil, highly pernicious, and altogether indige&s;tible by the &s;tomach. For roa&s;ting, the mellow and juicy kidney-piece, or the brea&s;t of veal, de&s;erves the preference: the leg is too dry and fibrous; it requires good teeth to be well chewed, renders the u&s;e of tooth-picks more nece&s;&s;ary than any other di&s;h, and is fre|quently trouble&s;ome to the &s;tomach. In &s;hort, veal does not agree well with weak and indolent &s;tomachs, which require to be exerci&s;ed with a firmer &s;pecies of meat. When boiled, it is but &s;lightly nouri&s;hing, and when we make a meal upon veal alone, we &s;oon feel a renewal of the cravings of the appetite. For removing the acid from the &s;tomach, veal is the mo&s;t im|proper article of diet. But to patients recov|ering from indi&s;po&s;ition, fir&s;t may be given veal-broth, then roa&s;ted veal, and la&s;tly beef; the properties of which we &s;hall now con&s;ider.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A horrid cu&s;tom has been introduced by luxury, of feeding calves cooped up in boxes &s;o &s;mall as to prevent all motion, and from which light is totally excluded: by this cruel refinement their fle&s;h is, by epicures, thought to be rendered more white and delicate; but if humanity does not revolt at this practice, tho&s;e who have any regard for health &s;hould avoid the u&s;e of the fle&s;h of an animal reared in this unnatural and putre&s;cent &s;tate.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Beef</HI> affords much good, animating, and &s;trong nouri&s;hment; and no other food is

equal to the fle&s;h of a bullock of a middle age. On account of its heating nature it ought not to be u&s;ed, where there is already an abun|dance of heat; and per&s;ons of a violent tem|per &s;hould eat it in moderation. It is pecu|liarly &s;erviceable to hard-working men; and its fat is nearly as ea&s;ily dige&s;ted as that of veal.</P>
<P>It de&s;erves, however, to be remarked, that the tongue, the inte&s;tines or tripe, and the &s;au|&s;ages made of beef are more difficult of dige&s;|tion than the mu&s;cular part; and that it would be extremely improper to give them to nur&s;es, children, or lying-in women.</P>
<P>The meat of old bullocks, fed and kept in the &s;tall, when unfit for labour, is &s;carcely di|ge&s;tible; it is burden&s;ome to the &s;tomach, and contains, as well as that of old cows, (which is &s;till wor&s;e) no whole&s;ome fluids. Though beef be more frequently eaten boiled, yet it is more nouri&s;hing and dige&s;tible when roa&s;ted. Finally, beef is almo&s;t the only &s;pecies of an|imal food, with which the &s;tomach is not ea|&s;ily &s;urfeited, and which is in proper &s;ea&s;on throughout the whole year.</P>
<P><HI>Pork</HI> yields a copious and permanent nour|i&s;hment, which does not di&s;agree with the ro|bu&s;t and laborious, but which, from its abund|ance of acrid fat, is not whole&s;ome to per&s;ons of a weak &s;tomach or &s;edentary life; as the&s;e animals live and are fed in &s;ties without exer|ci&s;e, and in an impure air. From the want of clean water, their fle&s;h acquires a tough and &s;trong con&s;i&s;tence, and is indige&s;tible but by a &s;trong and healthy bile. Per&s;ons who have
<PB N="45" REF="039111_0368_1013A1C0835EF9E0">
impure fluids, and a tendency to eruptions, as well as tho&s;e who have wounds or ulcers, &s;hould refrain from the u&s;e of pork; for this food will di&s;po&s;e them to inflammation and gangrene: it is equally improper in a catarrh|al &s;tate of the brea&s;t, in weak &s;tomachs, coughs, and con&s;umptions.</P>
<P>The antient phy&s;icians con&s;idered pork as the be&s;t and mo&s;t nutritious meat, if &s;upported by proper dige&s;tive powers. But they were cer|tainly mi&s;taken in this &s;uppo&s;ition; for, al|though its quality is &s;uch as renders a &s;maller quantity of it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;atisfy the cravings of the &s;tomach, yet veal and beef, taken in in|crea&s;ed proportions, afford equal, if not more nouri&s;hment, and doubtle&s;s a more whole&s;ome &s;upply of animal jelly, than pork, under &s;imi|lar circum&s;tances of the individual, would produce. By allowing the&s;e animals clean food, and the enjoyment of pure air and ex|erci&s;e, their fle&s;h might be much improved in &s;alubrity; but the farmer is little anxious about the quality of the meat, if he can pro|duce it in greater quantity, which he is certain to obtain from the pre&s;ent unnatural mode of feeding &s;wine. People of delicate habits may &s;ometimes eat pork &s;paringly; but it is an er|roneous notion that it requires a dram to a&s;&s;i&s;t its dige&s;tion; for &s;pirituous liquors may in|deed prevent, but cannot promote its &s;olution in the &s;tomach. It would be much better to drink nothing after pork for a &s;hort time, as it is u&s;ually very fat, and this fat is more &s;ubtle and &s;oluble than any other, and has nothing in it of the nature of tallow.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="039111_0369_1013A18185AA3200">
Pork, eaten in moderation, is ea&s;ily dige&s;ted. With tho&s;e who&s;e dige&s;tive organs are weak, no other &s;pecies of meat agrees in general &s;o well, as a &s;mall quantity of this. Hence the objections made again&s;t it relate more to the quantity than to the quality or &s;ub&s;tance; for if it be eaten in too great quantity, it is apt to corrupt the fluids, and to produce acrimony. We ought therefore to eat it &s;eldom and &s;par|ingly, and the appetite which many people have for this food &s;hould be kept within mod|erate bounds. The mo&s;t proper additions to pork, are the accidulated vegetables, &s;uch as goo&s;eberry or apple-&s;auce; which not only gratify the palate, but correct its properties, neutralize, in a manner, its great proportion of &s;at, and thus operate beneficially on the alimentary canal.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is little to be apprehended from the worms in &s;wine, which, according to a late di&s;covery of the celebrated Naturali&s;t G&Ouml;TZE, in Germany, are natural to the&s;e animals.

<P><HI>Lard,</HI> a &s;ofter fat collected from the entrails and the me&s;entary of hogs, becomes ea&s;ily ran|cid, and is otherwi&s;e relaxing to the digestive organs: for which rea&s;ons, it is &s;eldom u&s;ed in Engli&s;h cookery.</P>
<P>The <HI>mutton</HI> of &s;heep fed on dry pa&s;tures is a better and more nouri&s;hing food than that of others reared in moi&s;t places. Tho&s;e al&s;o fed upon the &s;ea-&s;hore are excellent meat, the &s;a|line particles which they imbibe giving at once con&s;i&s;tency and purity to their fle&s;h. The fle&s;h of rams is tough and unplea&s;ant, but that of ewes and &s;till more that of weathers, is of a rich, vi&s;cous nature. Young mutton is juicy and ea&s;ily dige&s;ted, but it is rather tough, and has not that bal&s;amic alimentary juice peculiar to &s;heep above a certain age. The be&s;t mut|ton is that of &s;heep not le&s;s than three, and not above &s;ix years old. Under three years of age, it has not attained its perfection and flavour.</P>
<P>A roa&s;ting piece of mutton ought to be ex|po&s;ed to the open air for &s;everal days, according to the weather and &s;ea&s;on; it affords then a palatable di&s;h, which is ea&s;ily dige&s;ted, and agrees with every con&s;titution. But the fat of mutton is almo&s;t indige&s;tible; for it ea&s;ily co|agulates

<P><HI>Lamb</HI> is a light and whole&s;ome food, not &s;o nutritious as mutton, but extremely proper for delicate &s;tomachs. The vegetables mo&s;t prop|er to be eaten with lamb are tho&s;e of an acid|ulated nature, as goo&s;eberries, forrel, and the like. It is fa&s;hionable to eat this meat when very young; but a lamb that has been allowed to &s;uck &s;ix months, is fatter and more mu&s;cu|lar, and in every re&s;pect better, than one which has been killed when two months old, and be|fore it has had time to attain its proper con|&s;i&s;tency.</P>
<P><HI>Hou&s;e Lamb</HI> is a di&s;h, prized merely becau&s;e it is un&s;ea&s;onable. Like all animals reared in an unnatural manner, its fle&s;h is in&s;ipid and detrimental to health.</P>
<P>The fle&s;h of <HI>Goats</HI> is hard, indige&s;tible, and unwhole&s;ome; hence the meat of kids only is e&s;culent, being more ea&s;ily dige&s;ted, and yield|ing a good nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>The fle&s;h of <HI>Deer (Veni&s;on),</HI> and that of <HI>Hare,</HI> contain much good nutriment; but, to the detriment of health, the&s;e animals are generally eaten when half putrified, though they are naturally much di&s;po&s;ed to putre&s;cen|cy. When properly dre&s;&s;ed, they afford a mellow food, and are readily a&s;&s;imilated to our fluids. But as wild animals, from their

con&s;tant motion and exerci&s;e, acquire a drier fort of fle&s;h than that of the tame, it &s;hould never be boiled, but always ought to be roa&s;t|ed or &s;tewed. From the &s;ame cau&s;e, the fluids of wild animals are more heating, and more apt to putrify, than tho&s;e of the dome&s;tic. Per&s;ons, therefore, who already have a pre|di&s;po&s;ition to &s;curvy or other putrid di&s;ea&s;es, &s;hould not eat much game, particularly in &s;um|mer. This pernicious tendency of game may be corrected by the addition of vinegar, acid of lemons, or wine; &s;alad al&s;o is very proper to be eaten with it. Tho&s;e parts of wild ani|mals, which have the lea&s;t motion, are the mo&s;t juicy and palatable: the back, for in|&s;tance, is the be&s;t part of a hare.</P>
<P>The <HI>lungs</HI> of animals contain nothing but air and blood-ve&s;&s;els, which are very tough, &s;olid, difficult to be dige&s;ted, and afford little nouri&s;hment.

The <HI>liv|er,</HI> from its dry and earthy con&s;i&s;tence, pro|duces a vitiated chyle, and ob&s;tructs the ve&s;|&s;els; hence it requires a great quantity of drink, and ought never to be u&s;ed by the plethoric: the blood-ve&s;&s;els and biliary parts adhering to it, are particularly di&s;agreeable. The <HI>heart</HI> is dry, &s;carcely dige&s;tible, and not very nouri&s;hing. The <HI>kidneys</HI> al&s;o are acrid, hard, tough, and not ea&s;ily dige&s;ted by the delicate.

Milk takes the lead among the articles of nouri&s;hment. It affords the be&s;t nutriment to per&s;ons who&s;e lacteals and blood-ve&s;&s;els are too weak for deriving nouri&s;hment from other provi&s;ions; becau&s;e it is already converted into an alimentary fluid in the inte&s;tines of an animal.</P>
<P>Nature has appointed this nutritive &s;ub|&s;tance, milk, as the food of children; becau&s;e infants, on account of their growth, require

much nouri&s;hment. From this circum&s;tance, we may al&s;o conclude, that milk is ea&s;ily di|ge&s;ted by healthy &s;tomachs, &s;ince at this early age the dige&s;tive powers are but feeble. Milk-porridge, however, as well as tho&s;e di&s;hes in the compo&s;ition of which milk and flour are u&s;ed, have a manife&s;t tendency to ob&s;truct the lecteals or milk-ve&s;&s;els of the inte&s;tines and the me&s;entary; a circum&s;tance which renders them extremely unwhole&s;ome, particularly to chil|dren. Milk, although an animal production, does not readily undergo putrefaction; as it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the properties of vegetable ali|ment, and turns &s;ooner <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> than putrid.

<P>As the milk of animals contains more cream than that of the human brea&s;t, it ought to be diluted with water, when given to infants.

or &s;oon after it comes from the cow. Through boiling, and even by long &s;tanding, the be&s;t and mo&s;t nutritious bal&s;amic particles evaporate.</P>
<P>The milk to be employed for diet in di&s;ea&s;es ought to be taken from healthy and well-nour|i&s;hed animals; for we &s;ee in children how much depends on the health of the mother, and how &s;uddenly they &s;uffer from an un|healthy or pa&s;&s;ionate nur&s;e. In Spring and Summer, the milk is peculiarly good and whole|&s;ome, on account of the &s;alubrious nouri&s;h|ment of herbs. In Winter it is much inferior. It is farther nece&s;&s;ary, that the animal furni&s;h|ing the milk &s;hould be kept in the free air, and have daily exerci&s;e. In order to obtain good milk, it would be advi&s;eable, for per&s;ons who have the opportunity, to keep a cow; for, be|&s;ides the adulteration of that which is &s;old, cows are frequently milked at an improper time, by which the milk is much injured, and cannot be whole&s;ome.</P>
<P>The be&s;t milk is obtained from the cow at three or four years of age, about three months after producing the calf, and in a &s;erene Spring morning. Good cow's milk ought to be white, without any &s;mell; and &s;o fat, that a drop be|ing allowed to fall on the nail will not run down in divi&s;ions. It is lighter, but contains more watery parts than the milk of &s;heep and goats; while, on the other hand, it is more thick and heavy than the milk of a&s;&s;es and mares, which come neare&s;t the con&s;i&s;tence of human milk. Ewe's milk is rich and nour|i&s;hing; and it yields much butter, which is &s;o
<PB N="54" REF="039111_0377_1013A18BCE12AD28">
un&s;avory, that it cannot be eaten. Both this and goat's milk produce much chee&s;e, which is tough, &s;trong, pungent, and difficult to be dige&s;ted.</P>
<P>As goats are fond of a&s;tringent herbs, their milk is &s;uperior in &s;trength to that of other animals; hence it has been &s;ometimes u&s;ed with the mo&s;t happy &s;ucce&s;s in hy&s;teric ca&s;es. Goat's whey and a&s;s's milk are chiefly u&s;ed in pulmonary con&s;umptions; where a&s;s's milk cannot be got, that of mares may be u&s;ed as a &s;ub&s;titute.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Artificial a&s;s's milk,</HI> not inferior in its properties to the natural, may be made by the following proce&s;s&punc;&mdash;Take of eryngo-root or &s;ea-holly, and pearl barley, each half an ounce&punc; liquorice-root three ounces; water two pounds or one quart; boil it down over a gentle fire to one pint, then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ain it, and add an equal quantity of new cow's milk.</NOTE></P>
<P>Milk con&s;i&s;ts of ca&s;eous, butyraceous, and watery parts; that which contains a well-pro|portioned mixture of the three, is the mo&s;t whole&s;ome. But this mixture is not always met with in due proportion&mdash;frequently the two fir&s;t, namely, chee&s;e and butter, predom|inate; and in this ca&s;e it affords indeed a &s;trong food, but is difficult of dige&s;tion. If the water form the greate&s;t proportion, it is then ea&s;ily dige&s;ted, but le&s;s nouri&s;hing. This is particularly the ca&s;e with a&s;s's milk, which, more than any other, affects the urine and &s;tool, while it has a tendency to purify the blood.</P>
<P>On account of the warmth, and the mechan|ical proce&s;s of the dige&s;tive organ, joined to the chemical properties of the acid generated in it, milk nece&s;&s;arily coagulates in every &s;tom|ach. The ca&s;eous part is di&s;&s;olved, and dilut|ed
<PB N="55" REF="039111_0378_1013A1CC65C18AE8">
by the admixture of the dige&s;tive liquors, and thus prepared for being changed into a pure chyle or milky fluid. Indeed, it makes no difference, whether we take cream, chee&s;e, and whey in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, or whether we con&s;ume them united in the ma&s;s of the milk: in the former ca&s;e, the &s;eparation takes place without, and in the latter within the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>It is however improper to eat acid &s;ub&s;tan|ces together with milk, as this ma&s;s would oc|ca&s;ion fermentation and corruption: while, on the contrary, the natural coagulation is on|ly a &s;eparation of the con&s;tituent parts, not a tran&s;ition of this mild fluid into the &s;tage of acid fermentation; for this is prevented by the &s;aponaceous dige&s;tive liquors, though the milk it&s;elf be coagulated.</P>
<P>Yet milk is not a proper food for the debil|itated, in all ca&s;es; nay, under certain cir|cum&s;tances, it may even be hurtful. It does not, for in&s;tance, agree with hypochondriacs; as it occa&s;ions cramp of the &s;tomach, cholic, heartburn, and diarrhoea. Febrile patients, who&s;e weak organs of dige&s;tion do not admit of nutritive food, and who&s;e preternatural heat would too ea&s;ily change the milk into a rancid ma&s;s, mu&s;t ab&s;tain from it altogether. It di&s;agrees al&s;o with the plethoric, the phleg|matic, and the corpulent; but particularly with tipplers, or tho&s;e addicted to &s;trong &s;pir|its. Its butyrous and chee&s;y parts may ob|&s;truct dige&s;tion and oppre&s;s the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, <HI>&s;our milk</HI> is unfit for u&s;e, on account of the chemical decompo&s;ition which has taken place in its con&s;tituent parts, and becau&s;e it
<PB N="56" REF="039111_0379_1013A18EA3A37D48">
can hardly be dige&s;ted by the mo&s;t powerful &s;tomach: even &s;weet milk ought not to be eaten together with fle&s;h meat, and in mo&s;t ca&s;es the whey is preferable to the milk.</P>
<P>With the&s;e exceptions, milk is an excellent &s;pecies of diet, which does not require &s;trong dige&s;tive organs, unle&s;s a variety of other &s;ub|&s;tances be eaten along with it. On the con|trary, per&s;ons much reduced in bodily vigour have received benefit, and in a great mea&s;ure been cured, by eating milk only. We daily ob&s;erve that children at the brea&s;t, with the natural inclination to acidity and vi&s;co&s;ity, feel its bad effects only, when, together with milk, they are fed upon cakes, pa&s;try, ginger|bread, and other tra&s;h. Milk being free from all acrimony, produces whole&s;ome, light, and &s;weet blood. Sugar and &s;alt are almo&s;t the only proper &s;pices to be added to it.</P>
<P><HI>Cream</HI> is exceedingly nouri&s;hing, but too fat and difficult to be dige&s;ted, in a &s;edentary life.</P>

<HI>Butter-milk</HI> is a &s;pecies of whey, but con|tains a great number of butyrous particles. If we drink it while new and &s;weet, it is refre&s;h|ing and cooling.</P>
<P>Before I quit the &s;ubject of milk, I cannot omit remarking, that this fluid, be&s;ides the qualities before enumerated, contains &s;ome &s;pirituous parts, <HI>in a latent-&s;tate,</HI> with which our chemi&s;ts are little acquainted. And al|though the&s;e parts cannot be di&s;engaged from the milk, and exhibited in a &s;eparate form, yet it is certain, that the Per&s;ians, and other inhabitants of the Ea&s;t, prepare a kind of wine from milk, which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all the prop|erties of intoxicating liquors. Such is the report of re&s;pectable travellers; but I am in|clined to &s;u&s;pect, that the&s;e Orientals make &s;ome addition to the &s;weet whey, after the ca&s;eous parts are &s;eparated from it, by which they induce a vinous fermentation. Wheth|er they add honey, &s;ugar, or any mucilagi|nous vegetable, containing the &s;accharine principle, I &s;hall not attempt to decide: but it is well known, that the Chine&s;e ferment and di&s;til a liquor from a mixture of rice and veal, which is not unplea&s;ant when new.</P>
<P><HI>Chee&s;e</HI> is obtained from the tough part of the milk, which &s;ub&s;ides in coagulation, and which mu&s;t be completely freed from the whey. All chee&s;e is difficult to be dige&s;ted,
<PB N="58" REF="039111_0381_1013A1903960D7C0">
being the coar&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t glutinous part of the milk, which the healthy and laborious on|ly can concoct in their &s;tomach. To others, it is too heavy; it imparts a thick and acrid chyle to the blood; it hardens in a weak &s;tomach, and accumulates an indurated earthy lump. When eaten new, in any con&s;iderable quantity, it corrupts&punc; the fluids; and if old, it becomes putrid. In &s;mall quantities after dinner, it can do no great harm, but it is ab|&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e that it a&s;&s;i&s;ts dige&s;tion; its effects, at be&s;t, being of a negative kind, that is, by producing a temporary &s;timulus on the &s;tomach: and even this is the ca&s;e only with &s;ound old chee&s;e which is neither too fat, nor too far advanced in the proce&s;s of putrefaction.</P>
<P>Toa&s;ted chee&s;e, though more agreeable to &s;ome palates than raw, is &s;till more indige&s;ti|ble. Chee&s;e, if too much &s;alted, like that of the Dutch, acquires, when old, a pernicious acrimony. The green Chee&s;e of Switzerland, which is mixed with a powder of the wild Melilot, or the <HI>Trifolium Melilotus,</HI> L., and the milder Sage-Chee&s;es prepared in Eng|land, are the almo&s;t only kind which may be eaten without injury; and even the&s;e &s;hould be u&s;ed in moderation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To &s;how the &s;trongly vi&s;cid quality of chee&s;e, and what powers of dige&s;tion it mu&s;t require to a&s;&s;imilate it to our fluids, I &s;hall mention a compo&s;ition which may be u&s;eful, as the &s;tronge&s;t cement yet contrived, for mending china cups, gla&s;&s;es, and the like. A piece of Che&s;hire or Glouce&s;ter chee&s;e is boiled in three or four different waters, till it form a &s;oft and ela&s;tic ma&s;s, freed of the whey and other extraneous ingredients.

<P>Some parts of fowls are le&s;s whole&s;ome than others.

of their fluids to putre&s;cency, are le&s;s whole&s;ome than any other bird. Water fowl afford the lea&s;t beneficial food. In general we find winged animals out of &s;ea&s;on in Spring; partly becau&s;e mo&s;t of them are then pairing, and partly on account of the long journeys of tho&s;e that are birds of pa&s;&s;age, by which they become leaner than at any other time of the year; yet &s;ome birds of pa&s;&s;age do not arrive in this climate till towards Autumn.</P>
<P>It is remarkable, that mo&s;t birds, when tak|en from their wild &s;tate, and fed in captivity, &s;uch as partridges, larks, and others, lo&s;e much of their peculiar flavour, which is al&s;o the ca&s;e with wild quadrupeds. Yet tho&s;e tame and dome&s;ticated fowls and animals, that are well fed in yards and &s;talls, are gen|erally more fat and mu&s;cular than tho&s;e which are obliged to &s;eek their own food.

<P>All birds living upon grain and berries afford good nutriment, except gee&s;e and ducks. The fle&s;h of the goo&s;e is unwhole&s;ome, e&s;peci|ally when fed in &s;mall inclo&s;ures, without exerci&s;e; which practice is &s;ometimes carried &s;o far, as cruelly to n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">il the animal to a board through the feet, to prevent its motion.

wounds and ulcers. It is al&s;o pernicious to tho&s;e who are di&s;po&s;ed to inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es, and to cutaneous eruptions.&mdash;A young hen, or chicken, is a very whole&s;ome di&s;h; its veg|etable aliment produces a mild and &s;weet chyle; and the whitene&s;s of its fle&s;h &s;hows its excellent quality. As it is ea&s;ily dige&s;ted, it is a di&s;h to be recommended to the weak and de|bilitated; and it agrees be&s;t with individuals of an acrid and mucous tendency, or &s;uch as are troubled with biliary and &s;tomachic di&s;orders.</P>
<P>The Capon is one of the mo&s;t delicate di&s;h|es; if eaten when young, he yields a &s;trong and good chyle; his fle&s;h is not of a heating nature, is not di&s;po&s;ed to putre&s;cency, and the fat it&s;elf is ea&s;ily dige&s;ted. Turkeys, as well as Guinea or India fowls, yield a &s;trong ali|ment, but are more difficult of dige&s;tion than the capon; particularly the legs, wings and fat. The&s;e birds, when roa&s;ted, are u&s;ually filled with &s;ome kind of heavy pudding, which is a favourite mor&s;el with many, but requires the &s;tronge&s;t dige&s;tive powers.&mdash;The old prej|udices, that the fle&s;h of capons is productive of the gout, and that of &s;parrows brings on epileptic fits, are too ab&s;urd to require refuta|tion.</P>

and afford a poor aliment. The ducks and gee&s;e only are eaten in Britain: of the&s;e the former afford the better nouri&s;hment, as they are generally not &s;o abundantly fat as the lat|ter, and are permitted to move about in the open air. But they ought not to be &s;uffered to repair to &s;tagnant waters, which they &s;wal|low, and which taint their fluids and fle&s;h with qualities detrimental to health.</P>
<P>Next to milk, no nutriment is &s;o &s;imple and &s;alutary as that of bird's <HI>eggs,</HI> among which tho&s;e of hens ju&s;tly de&s;erve the preference, in re&s;pect of nouri&s;hment, ta&s;te, and dige&s;tion. The albumen, or the white of eggs, corre&s;|ponds to our &s;erum, or the water of the blood; it is di&s;&s;olved in a warm temperature, but con&s;iderable heat makes it hard, tough, dry, and in&s;oluble. The yolk of eggs is more &s;oluble, contains much oil, and is uncommon|ly nouri&s;hing, but has a &s;trong tendency to putrefaction: hence eggs mu&s;t be eaten while fre&s;h. People of a weak &s;tomach ought to eat no kind of food ea&s;ily putre&s;cible, con&s;equent|ly no eggs. To tho&s;e, on the contrary, who dige&s;t well, a fre&s;h egg, boiled &s;oft, (or rath|er &s;tewed in hot water, from five to ten min|utes, without allowing it to boil) is a very light, proper, and, at the &s;ame time, nour|i&s;hing food.</P>
<P>Hard-boiled eggs, fried eggs, pan-cakes, and all artificial preparation of eggs, are heavy on the &s;tomach, corrupt our fluids, and are unwhole&s;ome. The eggs of ducks and gee&s;e ought not to be eaten, but by per&s;ons of the mo&s;t active and powerful &s;tomachs. All eggs

<P>The various articles of nouri&s;hment we derive from the Vegetable Kingdom, may with propriety be divided into five orders:</P>
<P>1&s;t, The different &s;pecies of farina, or grain, &s;uch as wheat, rye, barley, and oats.</P>
<P>2d, The legumes, or pul&s;e, &s;uch as peas, beans, &amp;c.</P>
<P>3d, The various kinds of &s;alads and pot|herbs.</P>
<P>4th, All the different roots; and,</P>
<P>5th, Fruit, or the production of trees and &s;hrubs.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e, namely the farinaceous, are very nouri&s;hing, on account of the copious mucilage they contain; but they are likewi&s;e difficult to dige&s;t. Bread it&s;elf, though ju&s;tly called <HI>the &s;taff of life,</HI> if eaten too freely, or to &s;erve as a meal, produces vi&s;cidity or &s;lime, ob&s;tructs the inte&s;tines, and lays the founda|tion of habitual co&s;tivene&s;s. All di&s;hes pre|pared of flour, are not only nouri&s;hing, but are emollient, attenuating, and correct acrimony. Leavened bread, or &s;uch as has acquired an acidulated ta&s;te by a &s;low fermentation of the dough, is cooling and anti&s;eptic; a circum|&s;tance
<PB N="69" REF="039111_0392_1013A1DEF4FF7970">
well e&s;tabli&s;hed by experience. By this proce&s;s of preparing the dough, all the tough parts are mo&s;t intimately mixed with the drier parts of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">our, and the fixed air is expelled in baking. New-baked bread always contains much of an indige&s;tible pa&s;te, which is reme|died, either by allowing it to dry for two or three days, or by toa&s;ting it. This ought to be done regularly, particularly in times of &s;carcity, both on account of health and econo|my. Stale bread, in every re&s;pect, de&s;erves the preference: and per&s;ons troubled with flat|ulency, cramp of the &s;tomach, and indige&s;tion, &s;hould not upon any account eat new bread, and &s;till le&s;s hot rolls and butter. Indeed, all pa&s;try whatever is unwhole&s;ome, e&s;pecially when hot. Tho&s;e who devour hot pies with avidity, &s;hould con&s;ider, that they contain an uncommon quantity of air, which di&s;tends the &s;tomach, and produces the mo&s;t alarming and dangerous cholics, and incurable ob&s;tructions, in&s;omuch that the &s;tomach and bowels have been known to bur&s;t. The porous quality of bread ari&s;es from the fixed air having been ex|pelled in baking; and the more &s;pongy the bread, it is the more whole&s;ome. But new|baked bread, and rolls in particular, require a &s;ound &s;tomach; becau&s;e they contain much mucilage, not having parted with all their moi&s;ture; and wheat-flour is more vi&s;cid than that of rye, which is the bread-corn of mo&s;t nations on the Continent.</P>
<P>Bread and butter, together with chee&s;e, as they are eaten in Holland and Germany, form a ma&s;s &s;carcely dige&s;tible. The external &s;ur|face
<PB N="70" REF="039111_0393_1013A227C21376B0">
of bread, or the cru&s;t, which has been more dried by the heat of the oven, is ea&s;ie&s;t dige&s;ted; it contains the empyreumatic part, expelled by fire from the flour; it produces an emollient effect on the bowels; but, at the &s;ame time, is more heating and le&s;s nouri&s;hing than the &s;ofter part, or crumb.</P>
<P>The great difference in bread is owing, partly to the different &s;pecies of grain from which it is made, partly to the time the flour has been kept; for, when new, it is more dif|ficult to deprive it of its tenacity; partly to its being more or le&s;s cleaned from the bran; partly to the different methods of fermenting and baking it; to the difference in the water with which the flour has been kneaded; and la&s;tly, to the various ingredients of which the pa&s;te has been compounded. The &s;oftne&s;s of the mill-&s;tones u&s;ed in grinding the flour, may al&s;o vitiate the bread, by introducing particles of &s;and and marble, &s;o as to make it equally noxious to the teeth, and oppre&s;&s;ive to the &s;tomach.

<P>The <HI>vermicelli,</HI> and <HI>macarone</HI> of the Italians, as well as all the different di&s;hes made of flour mixed up into pa&s;te, and either boiled in water or &s;tewed in butter, are ill calculated for patients and convale&s;cents, to whom they are frequently admini&s;tered. A pa&s;te, when it is &s;o ela&s;tic that it can be formed into balls, is extremely difficult to be dige&s;ted. All unfermented pa&s;try is exce&s;&s;ively trying to the &s;tomach; and in&s;tead of wondering that the lovers of &s;uch dainties are continually troubled with indige&s;tion and other &s;tomachic com|plaints, it would be again&s;t the order of things if it were otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>Bread ought not to be eaten with every di&s;h; it is more u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary with tho&s;e articles that contain much nouri&s;hment in a &s;mall bulk, in order to give the &s;tomach a proper degree of expan&s;ion. Be&s;ides, the addition of bread to animal food has another advantage, namely, that of preventing the di&s;gu&s;t attending a too copious u&s;e of fle&s;h, and its &s;trong tendency to putrefaction. But if we accu&s;tom our&s;elves to eat new baked bread, to provi&s;ions already indige&s;tible in them&s;elves, &s;uch as fat gee&s;e, bacon, blood-&s;au&s;ages, and the like, we make them &s;till more in&s;upportable to our dige&s;tive organs. Of the different kinds of grain, from which bread is prepared, that of rye is by far the mo&s;t whole|&s;ome for people of a &s;edentary life, as well as the delicate and nervous. For though it be

Compo&s;itions of various &s;ub&s;tances to &s;erve as &s;ub&s;titutes for bread, &s;uch as grey-peas, hor&s;e-beans, potatoes&punc; and many other farinaceous vegetables, were repeatedly tried. And although a very nouri&s;hing and palatable bread was form|ed of flour mixed with rice and potatoes, yet the prejudices of the lower, as well as the higher cla&s;&s;es of the people, in favour of wheaten bread, were too great and inveterate, to admit &s;o u&s;eful and beneficial an innovation.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Rice</HI> contains a thin, unela&s;tic, and ea&s;ily &s;oluble mucilage. It is one of the popular prejudices, that rice has a tendency to produce co&s;tivene&s;s: this is only &s;o far true as the u&s;e of it, by per&s;ons of languid and debilitated con&s;titutions, is &s;ometimes attended with flat|ulency, which &s;ufficiently accounts for its &s;ec|ondary effect. To avoid &s;uch unplea&s;ant con|&s;equences, rice ought to be eaten with the addition of &s;ome &s;pice, &s;uch as cinnamon, fen|nel, carraway, annis-&s;eed, and the like; par|ticularly by tho&s;e of a phlegmatic habit, and &s;low dige&s;tion.&mdash;In India, where this plentiful grain is almo&s;t the only food of the natives, it is regularly eaten with &s;uch quantities of pepper, and other &s;trong &s;pices, that Europe|ans, on their fir&s;t arrival, cannot partake of this high-&s;ea&s;oned di&s;h. From a cu&s;tom &s;o beneficial in its phy&s;ical effects, we may con|clude, that the Indians, though directed more by in&s;tinct than &s;cientific induction, are not altogether unacquainted with the rules of diet.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="039111_0396_1013A1E669FC1F88">
One of the be&s;t preparations of rice is the mucilage, or jelly, which is obtained by boil|ing two ounces of it ground to fine powder, and a quarter of a pound of loaf-&s;ugar in one pint of water, until it becomes a tran&s;parent thick broth: this, when expre&s;&s;ed through a cloth, and allowed to cool, is a palatable and whole&s;ome jelly.</P>
<P><HI>Oats,</HI> when hulled or deprived of the hu&s;k, and reduced to groans, are u&s;ed as the common di&s;h for the infirm and &s;ick in England, France, and Germany. They impart to the water a thick mucilage, which, with the addition of a few currants boiled in it, is of a nouri&s;hing and &s;lightly aperient quality.</P>
<P><HI>Barley,</HI> or rather pearl-barley, may be u&s;ed with a &s;imilar intention, and is perhaps &s;till more nutritive; but, after decoction, the gro&s;&s;|er parts which remain ought not to be eaten.</P>
<P><HI>Millet,</HI> or hir&s;e, is inferior to either oats or barley; it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es too crude a mucilage for relaxed or inactive &s;tomachs.</P>
<P><HI>Manna-gra&s;s</HI> (the <HI>fe&s;tuca fluitans</HI>) is &s;o called in Germany and Poland, becau&s;e its &s;eeds have a remarkably &s;weet and agreeable ta&s;te, particularly before the plant comes to its full growth. It excels in richne&s;s and nutriment all the other vegetable productions of Europe; and, boiled in milk, it affords excellent &s;oups as well as puddings. Two ounces of this manna, properly cooked in milk and water, would be a &s;ufficient meal for the mo&s;t robu&s;t and laborious man. Boiled in water alone, in the proportion of one ounce to three pints of water evaporated to one quart, with the
<PB N="74" REF="039111_0397_1013A22CF1F2C228">
addition of &s;ome &s;ugar and white wine, it makes an agreeable and nouri&s;hing di&s;h for lying-in women, and other patients for whom animal food is improper, and who&s;e &s;ituation requires the occa&s;ional &s;timulus of wine.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;econd</HI> order of vegetable aliment in|cludes all the leguminous productions, as beans, peas, lentils, and the like; the&s;e con|tain a &s;olid gluten or mucilage, and afford a rich and &s;trong nutriment, which be&s;t agrees with a vigorous &s;tomach. They al&s;o have a con&s;iderable proportion of crude particles, which cannot be a&s;&s;imilated to our fluids, and mu&s;t therefore remain undige&s;ted in the bow|els, to the great detriment of the alimentary canal. The <HI>meal</HI> of the leguminous cla&s;s is dige&s;ted with more difficulty than that of grain; be&s;ides, it contains much fixed air; on which account it is extremely flatulent, is apt to pro|duce co&s;tivene&s;s, and to communicate various kinds of acrimony to the blood. The&s;e effects, however, it produces only when it is eaten too frequently and copiou&s;ly. Hence bread, made of peas or beans, either alone or mixed and ground together with wheat, is improper for daily u&s;e.</P>
<P>Yet we mu&s;t not imagine, that even the mo&s;t whole&s;ome articles of food are altogether free from air: this element is a nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;e|ful ingredient, to promote the dige&s;tion of alimentary &s;ub&s;tances. The proportion of fix|ed air varies extremely in different vegeta|bles:&mdash;all the leguminous plants particularly
<PB N="75" REF="039111_0398_1013A1E7EF0E8628">
abound with it; and even per&s;ons with whom they agree well, mu&s;t have experienced flatu|lency and torpor, after a copious u&s;e of peas or beans. Tho&s;e who are fond of peas-&s;oup, would better con&s;ult their health, by boiling the peas whole, than &s;plit and deprived of their hu&s;ks; for the&s;e promote the grinding of the peas, and prevent them from turning acid in the &s;tomach, which &s;plit peas readily do, while they are apt to occa&s;ion oppre&s;&s;ion in the bow|els, and a very trouble&s;ome heart-burn.</P>
<P><HI>Green peas,</HI> as well as <HI>French beans,</HI> boiled in their fre&s;h &s;tate, are equally agreeable and whole&s;ome; for they are le&s;s flatulent, and more ea&s;y of dige&s;tion, than in their ripe &s;tate. It de&s;erves to be remarked, in general, that all vegetables of the pul&s;e kind, as they advance in growth, become more oppre&s;&s;ive to the &s;tomach, and con&s;equently le&s;s &s;alutary in their effects.</P>
<P>The <HI>third</HI> order of Vegetables compri&s;es the various kinds of &s;alads and herbs u&s;ed in cooking, &s;uch as greens, cabbage, &s;pinage, and the like. The&s;e contain a great propor|tion of water, and little nouri&s;hment: they &s;erve to fill the &s;tomach, re&s;i&s;t putrefaction, and may therefore be eaten more freely in &s;ummer than in winter; being, be&s;ides, of a &s;oftening, laxative, &s;aponaceous, and con&s;e|quently &s;olvent nature, they are well calcu|lated to relieve the bowels.

They become &s;oft by boiling, many of the a&euml;rial particles are expelled, and they are thus rendered more dige&s;tible. But the practice of boiling them in large quantities of water, which is afterwards poured off, is extremely ab&s;urd and injudicious; for, with the water, their be&s;t and mo&s;t nutritious parts are con&s;equent|ly thrown away: hence the&s;e vegetables ought to be thoroughly wa&s;hed, and, cabbage ex|cepted, &s;tewed in a &s;mall quantity of water, which will &s;o far be reduced by &s;low boiling, that it may be brought to the table, together with the vegetables.

<P><HI>Artichokes</HI> afford a light and tender food, perhaps &s;till more nutritive but le&s;s diuretic than a&s;paragus; for this rea&s;on, they are pref|erable for culinary u&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>Spinage,</HI> a favourite di&s;h with many, affords no nutriment, pa&s;&s;es quickly through the &s;to|mach and bowels, almo&s;t undige&s;ted; and, being u&s;ually dre&s;&s;ed with butter, it weakens the alimentary canal, produces loo&s;ene&s;s, and con&s;equently is not proper food for the weak and debilitated.&mdash;In languid &s;tomachs, &s;pinage is apt to produce acidity and the heart-burn.</P>
<P><HI>Sorrel</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es an acrid acidity, which de|prives the teeth of their enamel, and ought to be avoided by tho&s;e who are already troub|led with an acid ta&s;te in the mouth.</P>
<P><HI>Red Cabbage</HI> is one of the mo&s;t indige&s;tible vegetables, particularly as the French and Germans eat it, with ham and che&s;nuts; it is thus rendered heating, flatulent, and laxative,

and contains no nouri&s;hment.&mdash;More dige&s;ti|ble, cooling, and le&s;s hurtful to the bowels, are the young &s;prigs of cauliflower; but the mo&s;t indige&s;tible of all is the Colewort (<HI>Caulis ra|picius.</HI>) What has been &s;aid with re&s;pect to cabbage, is applicable al&s;o to the Orach, or <HI>Atriplex,</HI> and the Lettuce, when eaten boiled or &s;tewed.</P>
<P><HI>White Cabbage</HI> is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of excellent prop|erties; it is le&s;s flatulent than the common greens, and, being full of water, it is diuretic, and &s;omewhat laxative.&mdash;It is remarkable, that all herbs and plants, in general, are more or le&s;s flatulent, according to their dige&s;tibil|ity, and are di&s;po&s;ed to putre&s;cency; in pro|portion to the time they remain in the ali|mentary canal.</P>
<P>Of White Cabbage &s;liced or cut in thin &s;hreds, and afterwards &s;ea&s;oned and &s;alted, the Germans make <HI>Sauer Kraut;</HI> which is ea&s;ily dige&s;ted, on account of the &s;alt mixed with it, and the acetous fermentation it has undergone, before it is u&s;ed, and by which the greate&s;t part of its fixed air is expelled. Sauer Kraut may be pre&s;erved fre&s;h for a long time; it operates powerfully on the fir&s;t pa&s;|&s;ages, being one of the mo&s;t excellent anti&s;ep|tics; it has proved of &s;ingular &s;ervice at &s;ea, in re&s;i&s;ting the ravages of the &s;curvy, and curing it in the mo&s;t alarming &s;tages. We are indebted to Capt. Cook, for introducing this &s;alutary di&s;h among the &s;ailors, in &s;pite of all prejudices, and thus pre&s;erving the health of many brave mariners. La&s;tly, Sauer Kraut has been found the be&s;t preventive

<P><HI>Lettuce</HI> contains many nitrous particles, is very cooling, and u&s;eful in the evening to tho&s;e who cannot &s;leep, from the too great heat and undulations of the blood. But the copi|ous addition of oil and the yolk of eggs ren|ders it le&s;s dige&s;tible than when eaten in its &s;imple &s;tate; but if the&s;e mu&s;t be u&s;ed it is better to add &s;ome &s;ugar, which decompo&s;es the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances. The mo&s;t &s;uitable ingredi|ents of Salads, be&s;ides the Lettuce, are the va|rious Cre&s;&s;es, Chervil, (<HI>Chaerophyllum bulbo|&s;um, Linn.</HI>) and the &s;curvy-gra&s;s, which, to|gether with other cooling herbs, produce the effect of clean&s;ing the humours, or, as &s;ome &s;ay, of purifying the blood, and are at the &s;ame time diuretic; e&s;pecially if eaten in Spring, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">and upon an empty &s;tomach.</P>
<P>The <HI>fourth</HI> order of Vegetables con&s;i&s;ts of all the e&s;culent roots, or &s;uch as are u&s;ed at our tables. They are either of the mild, or of the a&s;tringent and acrid kind. The former are much more nouri&s;hing and le&s;s flatulent than the latter, which however po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome medic|inal powers, &s;uch as the various &s;pecies of rad|i&s;hes, onions, garlic, and the like.</P>
<P>Roots are neither &s;o nouri&s;hing, nor &s;o ea&s;ily dige&s;ted as animal food. Yet we may con&s;id|er it as a certain rule, that any kind of ali|ment,
<PB N="80" REF="039111_0403_1013A234AF172918">
for which we feel a natural and perma|nent appetite, is conformable to our nature. Of this kind is that beneficial root, the potato, which, in the mo&s;t &s;imple preparation, and without any addition, affords an agreeable and whole&s;ome food to almo&s;t every per&s;on, and particularly to children. It is one of the light|e&s;t alimentary &s;ub&s;tances, occa&s;ioning neither vi&s;cidity nor flatulence, and can be hurtful only, when immoderately u&s;ed. But, being a dry vegetable, and containing many earthy particles, it requires a proper quantity of drink to prevent ob&s;tructions. Its excellent nour|i&s;hment is &s;ufficiently obvious in the healthine&s;s of tho&s;e country people, who&s;e principal food is potatoes, as well as animals that are fattened upon the&s;e roots.</P>
<P>The quickne&s;s with which the chyle made from potatoes is a&s;&s;imilated to the blood, leaves no doubt that they are ea&s;ily dige&s;ted; for it is a general remark, that labouring people &s;ooner feel a renewal of their appetite, after potatoes, than any other &s;pecies of food. It is a groundle&s;s a&s;&s;ertion, that they generate a thick and crude chyle, and con&s;equently a gro&s;s and vi&s;cous blood. It is an equally un|founded &s;uppo&s;ition, which is amply refuted by experience, that the potato is a narcotic root, and that it is apt to &s;tupify the powers of the mind. This effect is produced only from a too copious u&s;e of it, together with want of exerci&s;e; in which ca&s;es any other food would be attended with &s;imilar con&s;e|quences.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="039111_0404_1013A1EFCA48A120">
The &s;timulating powers a&s;cribed to potatoes appear to me merely fanciful. Tho&s;e of a farinaceous con&s;i&s;tence are much more ea&s;ily dige&s;ted, than the heavy and gelatinous kind. The flour made of potatoes is more whole&s;ome for pa&s;try, and for all tho&s;e di&s;hes prepared of meal, than any other. The French have late|ly contrived a method of preparing a granula|ted flour from this root, which is grateful to the palate, and very nouri&s;hing. It is per|formed by a machine of &s;imple con&s;truction, a repre&s;entation of which, together with a de|&s;cription, was given, &s;ome time ago, in the Repertory of the Arts and Manufactures;&mdash;and it has al&s;o been u&s;ed &s;ucce&s;sfully, when mixed with wheat flour, in making bread.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Whatever has been formerly &s;aid again&s;t the u&s;e of potatoes, it is now well under&s;tood that they are whole&s;ome nouri&s;hing, and light to the &s;tomach, even in the weake&s;t con&s;titutions.&mdash;M. <HI>Parmentier,</HI> of Paris, lived for &s;everal weeks on potatoes only, without experiencing any ill effects on his health.</NOTE></P>
<P>The <HI>Beet-root</HI> contains a large proportion of &s;accharine matter. By the late&s;t experiments of M. Achard, of Berlin, it has been proved, that about fourteen pounds weight produced one pound of raw &s;ugar, exceedingly &s;weet, and without the intermixture of any other ta&s;te. Independent of this con&s;ideration, the beet is a valuable root, both in an economical and culinary re&s;pect; it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of mild aperient qualities, and ought to be eaten more frequently, for &s;upper, by tho&s;e who are of a co&s;tive habit. Although it is not difficult of dige&s;tion, yet &s;ome le&s;s flatulent root, &s;uch as par&s;ley, celery, or even potatoes, ought to be u&s;ed together with the beet; which addition
<PB N="82" REF="039111_0405_1013A23743704B78">
will render it not only more palatable, but al|&s;o more &s;uitable to the &s;tomach and bowels.</P>
<P><HI>Carrots</HI> are extremely flatulent, and there|fore an improper food for the weak, and tho&s;e inclined to acidity; by &s;uch individuals they can &s;carcely be dige&s;ted, unle&s;s taken with the addition of &s;pice, and a proper quantity of &s;alt; by which means their fermentation and corruption in the &s;tomach will be in a great mea&s;ure prevented. In other re&s;pects, they contain a good and copious alimentary fluid, at the &s;ame time powerfully affect the kidneys, and are likewi&s;e anthelmintic, or de&s;tructive of worms.</P>
<P><HI>Par&s;nips,</HI> be&s;ides their &s;weet mucilage, con|tain &s;omewhat of the aromatic principle, be|ing more nouri&s;hing and le&s;s flatulent than carrots. To deprive them entirely of the latter quality, they ought to be boiled in two different waters; but by this precaution they partly lo&s;e their &s;weet ta&s;te, and become le&s;s nouri&s;hing.</P>
<P><HI>Turnips</HI> are nutritive, but flatulent, and not ea&s;y of dige&s;tion; they become &s;till more in|dige&s;tible with age.&mdash;The lea&s;t flatulent and mo&s;t nouri&s;hing of the&s;e roots are the long kind, or Swedi&s;h Turnip, lately introduced into this country.</P>
<P><HI>Par&s;ley,</HI> as well as <HI>Smallage,</HI> are of a &s;weet, &s;timulating, and aromatic nature. The for|mer, e&s;pecially, was by the older phy&s;icians &s;uppo&s;ed to purify the blood; an effect which modern medical ob&s;ervers would not only doubt, but even ridicule. So much, howev|er, is certain, that par&s;ley is a mild aperient
<PB N="83" REF="039111_0406_1013A1F369413010">
and diuretic. Yet, for the&s;e &s;alutary pur|po&s;es, it ought not to be eaten in a raw but boiled &s;tate.</P>
<P><HI>Celery</HI> is one of the mo&s;t fragrant roots we po&s;&s;e&s;s in our climate, though its &s;hoots and leaves are more commonly u&s;ed for &s;alads, than the root it&s;elf. There are two &s;pecies of celery known among gardeners, both of which are e&s;timable: one produces thick knobby roots, not unlike the &s;ize and figure of a &s;hort pine-apple; the other has a variety of &s;mall white, tender, and odorous roots. The latter &s;pecies is more common in this country, while the former is much e&s;teemed in France and Germany, where it is eaten in thin &s;lices, previou&s;ly &s;oaked in vinegar; a preparation which, in &s;ummer, affords a cool|ing and whole&s;ome di&s;h. In a raw &s;tate, cele|ry is dige&s;ted with &s;ome difficulty, which may be removed by boiling it in water, or &s;oaking it, as before ob&s;erved, for a &s;hort time in vine|gar.&mdash;The Germans prepare an artificial cof|fee from this root, by cutting it into &s;mall &s;quare pieces, which are dried and roa&s;ted in the u&s;ual manner. Dr. UNZER occa&s;ionally recommends this native coffee to his patients, particularly to nur&s;es and lying-in-women, as a whole&s;ome &s;ub&s;titute for either tea, or the real coffee of the &s;hops.</P>
<P>The <HI>Skirret-root,</HI> and the <HI>Scorzenera</HI> of Spain, po&s;&s;e&s;s more &s;picy and &s;timulating than nutritive qualities. Both the&s;e roots, as well as the three preceding, are diuretic, and con|&s;equently in a &s;light degree &s;timulating. The &s;kirret, in particular, has an agreeably &s;weet
<PB N="84" REF="039111_0407_1013A239E48CE730">
and &s;picy flavor, and is &s;o tender, that it can &s;carcely bear to be boiled. For this rea&s;on, it is mo&s;t properly eaten when raw, like fruit, or may be u&s;ed as an excellent ingredient in &s;oups and broths.&mdash;The Scorzenera, on the contrary, ought to be deprived of its black &s;kin, and only eaten boiled: by &s;oaking the raw root for half an hour in cold water, it lo&s;es its bitter ta&s;te, and is likewi&s;e rendered le&s;s flatulent.</P>
<P>The <HI>Sal&s;afy,</HI> or Goat's-beard, is a root con|taining &s;till more of the &s;accharine principle, than the &s;corzenera: being a good &s;ub&s;titute for &s;parrowgra&s;s, and more ea&s;ily reared in this climate, it certainly de&s;erves to be more generally cultivated in our gardens.</P>
<P><HI>Onions, Garlic, Shallot,</HI> and <HI>Chives,</HI> are &s;timulants: they a&s;&s;i&s;t dige&s;tion, relieve the bowels, expel flatulency, di&s;&s;olve &s;lime or mu|cus, and are therefore beneficial in di&s;ea&s;es which proceed from too much vi&s;cidity; be|&s;ides, they increa&s;e the appetite, and ought to be u&s;ed principally as &s;pices, or medicines. They are powerful expectorants, but mu&s;t be avoided by very hot, irritable, and choleric temperaments. Although the&s;e roots are eaten in quantities by whole nations, yet from their penetrating and volatile &s;mell, which they communicate to the human breath, it is certain they agree be&s;t with individuals of a cold and phlegmatic habit, and tho&s;e who&s;e &s;tomachs require &s;o powerful a &s;tim|ulus.</P>
<P>All kinds of <HI>Radi&s;hes</HI> may be con&s;idered as medicinal roots; they are peculiarly calculat|ed
<PB N="85" REF="039111_0408_1013A1F4EF681008">
to di&s;&s;olve &s;limy humours, to generate, and al&s;o to expel flatulency; moving the air in|clo&s;ed in the inte&s;tines, and expelling it, by the copious air contained in them&s;elves. They are &s;alubrious to &s;trong and active &s;tomachs; but in tho&s;e which are deficient in ela&s;ticity, radi&s;hes increa&s;e flatulency to the highe&s;t and mo&s;t trouble&s;ome degree. The &s;mall &s;alad|radi&s;hes are more readily dige&s;ted than the large root; they propel all the alimentary fluids towards the &s;tomach, increa&s;e the ap|petite, and are therefore proper to be eaten before a meal. Old radi&s;hes are altogether indige&s;tible, and the whole genus, like onions and garlic, occa&s;ion a very offen&s;ive breath.</P>
<P>The <HI>Arrow-root powder,</HI> lately imported in|to this country from the Ea&s;t Indies, appears to afford a larger proportion of nutritive mu|cilage than any vegetable hitherto di&s;covered: but it is to be regretted that the exorbitant retail-price (eight &s;hillings the pound weight) will preclude many invalids and convale&s;|cents from u&s;ing this excellent root in broths and jellies.</P>
<P>The <HI>fifth</HI> and la&s;t order of Vegetable &s;ub|&s;tances comprehends the <HI>Fruit,</HI> or productions, of the different trees and &s;hrubs.</P>
<P>Fruit, in general, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;trongly re&s;olv|ent powers, and it is the more beneficial, as it comes to maturity at a time when the body is relaxed by the heat of &s;ummer, and when the blood has a &s;trong tendency to inflamma|tion.

It is be&s;ides of great &s;ervice in attenua|ting the thick bilious impurities collected dur|ing the &s;ummer, and of evacuating them by its laxative virtues. The acid contained in mo&s;t kinds is as u&s;eful to quench thir&s;t, as to re&s;i&s;t putrefaction. In weak &s;tomachs, how|ever, or &s;uch as are filled with impurities and &s;lime, it is apt to ferment, and occa&s;ion &s;ome inconvenience; but this may be avoided by a temperate u&s;e, and e&s;pecially by eating it boiled.</P>
<P>The more &s;ap or juice we meet with in fruit, it will prove the more flatulent; and as the juicy, cooling, and watery &s;pecies of fruit require &s;trong dige&s;tive organs, to prevent them from producing fermentation, flatulen|cy, and diarrhoea, a gla&s;s of old wine is very proper to promote their dige&s;tion. A gentle diarrhoea, brought on by eating ripe fruit, in &s;ummer, has frequently a &s;alutary effect.&mdash;Acrid and a&s;tringent fruit, being rather a med|icine than food, is le&s;s hurtful to the healthy, and to children, than is commonly imagined. In&s;tead of being noxious, as &s;ome imagine, in inflammatory di&s;orders, it is of the greate&s;t &s;ervice. Per&s;ons of a thick and black blood cannot eat any thing more conducive to health than fruit, as it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the property of atten|uating and putting &s;uch blood in motion; but tho&s;e of a watery and phlegmatic con&s;titution ought carefully to avoid it.</P>
<P>Fruit pre&s;erved with &s;ugar is anti&s;eptic and nouri&s;hing, but at the &s;ame time flatulent; and if pre&s;erved with &s;ugar and &s;pices, it is heating and drying. It is mo&s;t whole&s;ome when eat|en
<PB N="87" REF="039111_0410_1013A1F77795C450">
on an empty &s;tomach, which can exert all its power to di&s;pel the air di&s;engaged from it, and to remove it, before it begins to ferment. Boiling, as well as drying, corrects the flatu|lent tendency of fre&s;h fruit, &s;o that, thus pre|pared, it will agree with every body. By ei|ther of the&s;e methods it is deprived of its &s;uperfluous humidity, as well as of its fixed air; whence it becomes more nouri&s;hing, but le&s;s cooling, than in the fre&s;h &s;tate.</P>
<P><HI>Sago</HI> is the medullary part, or marrow, col|lected from a &s;pecies of palm-tree growing in the Mulucca and other i&s;lands of the Ea&s;t-In|dies. This &s;ub&s;tance, although not &s;trictly the fruit of a tree, well de&s;erves the fir&s;t place here; for it is u&s;ed as bread by the natives of India, who macerate it in water, and form it into cakes. The grains of &s;ago, &s;old in the &s;hops, are obtained by a more artificial proce&s;s: they furni&s;h a nouri&s;hing and agreeable jelly with water, milk, or broth; but require to be previou&s;ly cleaned of the du&s;t, mould, and &s;ea-water. To make a complete &s;olution of &s;ago, the fir&s;t decoction ought to be &s;trained, and afterwards boiled a &s;econd time, for about half an hour. Prepared in this manner, it is a proper di&s;h for the con&s;umptive and con|vale&s;cent, as well as tho&s;e who&s;e dige&s;tion is weak or impaired.</P>
<P><HI>Cherries</HI> produce the effects now &s;tated, in a very pre-eminent degree; they are excellent in &s;curvy, in putrid fevers, and in dy&s;entery; they correct the blood when inclined to pu|tre&s;cency, and by their &s;aponaceous and mel|liferous juice, they powerfully re&s;olve ob&s;truc|tions

in the inte&s;tines. Tho&s;e who u&s;e them with this intention, may eat them at any time of the day, though they operate mo&s;t effectu|ally in the morning, on an empty &s;tomach. Even the &s;weet &s;pecies contain a &s;timulating acid, which, in proportion to their juicy con|&s;i&s;tence, di&s;agrees more or le&s;s with the weak and debilitated; for this &s;ap or juice ea&s;ily ferments in the &s;tomach, and produces flatu|lency, diarrhoea, and acidity. On account of the&s;e peculiar effects, per&s;ons who&s;e &s;tomachs are bilious and vitiated, who are troubled with putrid eructations, and an offen&s;ive breath, ought to eat them freely, to counteract that di&s;po&s;ition to putridity.</P>
<P>Cherries are divided into the aqueous-&s;weet, aqueous-acid, and the dry pulpous kinds. The Spani&s;h cherries are the mo&s;t difficult to dige&s;t, but are al&s;o the mo&s;t nouri&s;hing. The aqueous-&s;weet kind, as our early common cherries, are unwhole&s;ome; becau&s;e their juice ea&s;ily ferments, and occa&s;ions colic and diar|rhoea. The watery-acid &s;ort are the be&s;t of any; their juice &s;trengthens the &s;tomach, pu|rifies the blood, and is the lea&s;t flatulent. Dried cherries are in many di&s;ea&s;es an excel|lent article of diet, on account of their cooling and anti&s;eptic properties. The &s;wallowing of cherry-&s;tones, however, is highly perni|cious, as the&s;e &s;tones have &s;ometimes been found to accumulate in the inte&s;tines, to form lumps cemented together by vi&s;cid phlegm, and thus to produce the mo&s;t violent and fa|tal &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="039111_0412_1013A1FB4C909938">
<HI>Plums</HI> al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;s medicinal virtues; they are nouri&s;hing and attenuating. Prunes, or dried plums, are of peculiar &s;ervice to co&s;tive habits, affording an agreeable and nutritive di&s;h; but, as they are apt to produce flatulency, it would be advi&s;eable to eat them either when the &s;tomach is empty, or for &s;upper, without mixing them with other aliment. Under this limitation, they are both aperient and cooling, and agree with almo&s;t every con&s;titution; but plums eaten fre&s;h, and not quite ripe, e&s;pe|cially in large quantities, are very apt to oc|ca&s;ion loo&s;ene&s;s, colics, and other maladies of the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines. The larger &s;ort of plums are in general more dangerous, in this re&s;pect, than the &s;mall ones, as they (par|ticularly the green and yellow kind) are &s;el|dom allowed to grow perfectly ripe.</P>
<P><HI>Tamarinds</HI> are more frequently employed for medicinal purpo&s;es, than as an article of diet. The pulp of this fruit is one of the mo&s;t grateful acids; which, if taken in the quanti|ty of from half an ounce to an ounce or more, proves gently purgative. By its acidity, it is well calculated to quench thir&s;t and allay im|moderate heat.</P>
<P><HI>Peaches</HI> abound with juice, and though not very nouri&s;hing, they are not productive of diarrhoea. This &s;alutary fruit was formerly decried as unwhole&s;ome; but it is rather &s;er|viceable in ob&s;tructions and bilious di&s;orders. Sugar, wine, and the like, dimini&s;h the good qualities of peaches; and even when pre&s;erv|ed in brandy, they are not &s;o whole&s;ome as when fre&s;h; &s;ince they become hard by all ar|tificial

preparations. The kernels likewi&s;e of peaches are a whole&s;ome bitter, and are clean|&s;ing, on account of their a&s;tringent properties.</P>
<P>As there are various kinds of peaches, of an inferior quality, it will be u&s;eful to point out the di&s;tingui&s;hing marks of that fruit, in a mature &s;tate. The be&s;t &s;ort of peaches have a delicate thin &s;kin, which is ea&s;ily &s;eparated from the pulpous part. Tho&s;e which are not naturally &s;mooth ought to be covered with only a &s;mall quantity of down; for too much down or wool on the &s;urface is a &s;ign of their inferior quality. They are likewi&s;e not to be depended upon as being whole&s;ome, if they are of a &s;ize either too &s;mall or preternatural|ly large. Their pulp ought to be delicate, yet &s;olid, &s;omewhat fibrous, and full of juice; it &s;hould not adhere to the &s;tone or kernel, and readily melt in the mouth.</P>
<P><HI>Apricots</HI> are more pulpy than peaches, but perhaps le&s;s nutritive: their juice readily fer|ments and turns acid in weak &s;tomachs; yet, when ripe, and u&s;ed with moderation, they are cooling and anti&s;eptic, particularly for bil|ious and plethoric individuals.</P>
<P>Of <HI>Pears,</HI> &s;ome are extremely hard, a&s;trin|gent, and difficult of dige&s;tion; but the more juicy pears have a &s;aponaceous, nouri&s;hing, and readily dige&s;tible fluid; in their effects they re&s;emble the &s;weet kind of apples, ex|cept that they are le&s;s relaxing to the bowels.

<P><HI>Apples</HI> are, in their general effect, &s;imilar to other fruit, and, be&s;ides their aromatic virtues, are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of laxative properties.

With this intention, apples are mo&s;t bene|ficial when eaten either roa&s;ted or boiled. The common people in Germany are &s;o &s;en&s;ible of their excellent properties, in inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es, that they boil even the wild apples, and drink the water. This proce&s;s de&s;erves imitation, e&s;pecially when apples become &s;carce in Spring.</P>
<P>Apples may be divided into the &s;picy, the acidulated, and the watery &s;pecies. The fir&s;t, the various kinds of rennet, for example, have the mo&s;t delicate flavor, and are certainly the be&s;t; they do not contain a &s;uperfluity of wa|ter, and, from their vinous nature, are not apt to excite flatulency. Other kinds of apples, like the pippins, are too hard, con&s;equently heavy to the &s;tomach, though &s;omewhat more nouri&s;hing than the former. Stewed apples are ea&s;ily dige&s;ted and whole&s;ome.</P>
<P>The kernels or &s;eeds of apples are bitter and aromatic; Nature &s;eems to have intend|ed the &s;eeds for correcting the watery and fermentable fluids of this and all other fruit, apricots excepted. Hence the kernels of ap|ples and pears, as well as tho&s;e of plums and cherries, ought to be eaten with the fruit, and not be thrown away as u&s;ele&s;s.&mdash;The but|ter

<P>Of <HI>Quinces</HI> we have two &s;pecies, namely, the apple and pear-quince: the latter are the mo&s;t whole&s;ome, particularly tho&s;e of Portu|gal. They are an excellent anti&s;eptic, and in this re&s;pect the be&s;t kind of fruit, contain|ing an acid and much mucilage. They are not productive of ob&s;tructions; but their pulp, like that of all other fruit, is dige&s;ted with &s;ome difficulty. They are generally eat|en boiled with &s;ugar, and are excellent in dy&s;entery, on account of their copious mu|cilage.</P>
<P>In <HI>Lemons, Oranges,</HI> and other fruit of that kind, we meet with three different &s;ub&s;tances. The external rind contains an e&s;&s;ential oil, &s;trongly a&s;tringent and heating; the &s;econd or white rind is without ta&s;te; the third part of them is a &s;alubrious, cooling, and acid pulp, highly efficacious in counteracting the putrid tendency and di&s;&s;olution of the blood. The juice of lemons and limes is one of the &s;tronge&s;t vegetable acids;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If the objections &s;tarted again&s;t the u&s;e of the&s;e acids, by a late phy&s;ician in Germany, Dr. UNZER, be well founded, we ought to guard again&s;t their u&s;e. He maintains that, although lemons and limes may be whole&s;ome and refre&s;hing fruits in their native country, yet as they are packed up and &s;ent to us in an unripe &s;tate, they po&s;&s;e&s;s an acrid and unnatural acid; from not having undergone the vinous and acetous fermentations, and which con&s;equently cannot be whole&s;ome. The juice, e&s;pecially, which is obtained from the middle of tho&s;e fruits, having acquir|ed, an highly a&s;tringent though not unplea&s;ant ta&s;te, from the &s;typtic quality of the bitter kernels, is extremely unwhole&s;ome. It is, according to the ob&s;ervations of Dr. Unzer, very apt to im|pair dige&s;tion, and to occa&s;ion either diarrhoea or con&s;tipation of the bowels.&mdash;Such effects, however, will be produced only when the&s;e acids are <HI>immoderately</HI> u&s;ed; in which ca&s;e the mo&s;t whole|&s;ome &s;ub&s;tances will be attended with bad con&s;equences, and ever form exceptions from the general rule.

and &s;haddocks, though milder, is not le&s;s &s;alutary.</P>
<P>The&s;e acids are of a very &s;aponaceous con|&s;i&s;tence; they attenuate the fluids, remove ob&s;tructions, encourage dige&s;tion, &s;timulate the appetite, quench thir&s;t, cool the blood, counteract putrefaction, are a principal reme|dy in pectoral, bilious, and inflammatory di&s;|ea&s;es, as likewi&s;e in &s;curvy, in all affections of the kidneys, and an antidote again&s;t the narcotic vegetable poi&s;ons. Hence the larg|e&s;t do&s;e of opium may be checked in its nar|cotic effects, if a proper quantity of the acid of lemons be taken with, or immediately af|ter it. Four grains of pure opium, for in|&s;tance, or one hundred drops of laudanum, is a very powerful and &s;ometimes fatal do&s;e; yet if one ounce of the pure acid of lemons, or two ounces of orange juice, be added to every grain of opium, or to twenty-five drops of laudanum, it will produce a very different effect. In&s;tead of &s;tupifying the per&s;on who takes it, and of being attended with painful co&s;tivene&s;s, it will not only prove laxative, but induce fir&s;t a cheerfulne&s;s, not attainable by the u&s;e either of opium or &s;trong liquors, and afterwards bring on a gentle and refre&s;h|ing &s;leep.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="039111_0417_1013A24851046E18">
Of the&s;e effects I can &s;peak from my own experience, as well as that of others. Opium, u&s;ed with this addition, is one of the mo&s;t &s;al|utary and beneficial &s;ub&s;tances with which we are acquainted. I am farther inclined to be|lieve, that the Turks, who eat very little ani|mal food, could not bear the large quantities of opium they &s;wallow, were it not for the copious u&s;e of vegetable acids. And that the&s;e form a principal part of a Turki&s;h &s;um|mer diet, every traveller knows, who has vi&s;ited the ea&s;tern climates.</P>
<P>For the&s;e rea&s;ons, I cannot &s;ufficiently rec|ommend the u&s;e of acids to per&s;ons, who are either accu&s;tomed, or obliged, to take opiates in large do&s;es. In choleric, bilious, and pleth|oric habits, in tho&s;e liable to ob&s;tructions, who&s;e alimentary canal is unclean, and la&s;tly, in tho&s;e who feel a determination of the blood to the head, opium is an uncertain, and even dangerous medicine, without the addition of vegetable acids. The want of the acid of lemons may be effectually &s;upplied by an in|digenous production:&mdash;barberries afford an acid fully as &s;trong, and nearly as agreeable, as that of lemons.</P>
<P>The juice of the various &s;pecies of <HI>Rai&s;ins</HI> is not unlike that of <HI>ripe</HI> lemons in its properties, but le&s;s efficacious. There are various kinds of that excellent fruit. Among the larger &s;ort, tho&s;e of a bluei&s;h colour, imported from Mar&s;eilles, are the be&s;t; while the Spani&s;h rai&s;ins, of a light brown colour, are inferior to tho&s;e of any other &s;pecies. Both kinds, as well as <HI>Currants,</HI> contain much nutriment,
<PB N="95" REF="039111_0418_1013A202325D9DA0">
but cannot be recommended for frequent u&s;e, as they all tend to produce flatulency, partic|ularly in individuals of relaxed habits and a &s;edentary life. On this account, they ought to be eaten with other food, in which ca&s;e they are emollient, gently laxative, and &s;ome|times anodyne.</P>
<P><HI>Goo&s;eberries,</HI> having le&s;s of the acid than either rai&s;ins or currants, are perhaps more whole&s;ome, e&s;pecially if their &s;kin and other impurities are not &s;wallowed together with the juice. When u&s;ed in a green &s;tate, for &s;auces and pies, they are cooling and refre&s;hing; and, when ripe, po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;imilar properties with cherries.</P>
<P><HI>Figs</HI> abound with &s;accharine matter, and are uncommonly nutritive, though at the &s;ame time of a flatulent nature, unle&s;s eaten with bread or other mealy &s;ub&s;tances.&mdash;Of &s;imilar effects are mulberries and ra&s;pberries: the former have a more mucilaginous and nouri&s;h|ing juice, while that of the latter is more of a vinous nature, and one of the be&s;t cordials for allaying thir&s;t and affording refre&s;hment.</P>
<P><HI>Grapes</HI> and <HI>Strawberries</HI> are both excellent fruits. They are uncommonly re&s;olvent, lax|ative without debilitating, and promote all the natural evacuations; but at the &s;ame time, grapes are in a high degree flatulent.</P>
<P>The quality of grapes depends much on climate and &s;oil. Tho&s;e of a &s;weet ta&s;te, and aromatic flavour, only ought to be u&s;ed. They agree be&s;t when eaten on an empty &s;tomach, with a &s;mall quantity of bread. Be&s;ides their &s;lightly nouri&s;hing quality, it is affirmed by
<PB N="96" REF="039111_0419_1013A249D5CFA610">
&s;ome writers, that they cool the blood and an|imate the nerves.</P>
<P>Strawberries, if eaten plentifully, have been found a &s;afe preventive again&s;t the &s;tone in the kidneys; as is atte&s;ted by the experience of the celebrated LINNAEUS. Yet the &s;mall &s;tones contained in &s;trawberries, as well as in grapes, are &s;aid to accumulate in the inte&s;tines of &s;ome individuals, and to give ri&s;e to the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate con&s;tipations, nay even to the iliac pa&s;&s;ion. The be&s;t method of eating &s;traw|berries is with pure water, and &s;weetened with a little &s;ugar; they are more heating with wine, but le&s;s whole&s;ome; with milk or cream they are an agreeable but improper compo|&s;ition. As a medicine, the wild &s;trawberry is far preferable to any other.</P>
<P><HI>Cucumbers</HI> are a whole&s;ome, gently opening, and cooling fruit, which may be of con&s;ider|able &s;ervice to the con&s;umptive, as it has the property of &s;weetening acrid humours.

<P>Much of the &s;ame nature with cucumbers are <HI>Melons;</HI> but they are more aromatic, and, in this re&s;pect, more whole&s;ome. <HI>Water-melons</HI> require more &s;pice and wine than <HI>Mu&s;k-melons;</HI>

<HEAD>Of Drink in particular.</HEAD>
<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>I. With re&s;pect to its Quantity.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Drinking</HI> is perhaps more nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;upport of animal life than <HI>Eating;</HI> for drink is indi&s;pen&s;able to the &s;olution and dige&s;tion of food. Tho&s;e who drink too little, people, for in&s;tance, of a &s;edentary life, and particularly women, are &s;ubject to complaints of indi|ge&s;tion. Sufficient drink prevents the incra&s;|&s;ation of the blood, and the ob&s;truction of the &s;maller ve&s;&s;els; it tends to clear the blood of the acrid particles generated in it; and it pro|motes the nece&s;&s;ary &s;ecretions, &s;uch as the bile and the ga&s;tric juice of the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>We ought to drink only when we are thir&s;ty, and to de&s;i&s;t when thir&s;t is quenched: but this is &s;eldom the ca&s;e, becau&s;e many of our liquors &s;timulate the palate. Pure water, therefore, is an ine&s;timable beverage, as it will not induce us to drink more than is nece&s;&s;ary. We &s;hould drink in a greater proportion than we eat; for the quantity of our fluids by far exceeds that of the &s;olids, and con&s;equently there mu&s;t be &s;ecreted more fluids than &s;olids. The general rule may be given, to take about double the proportion of liquid to the dry food; but this cannot be accurately ob&s;erved, nor is it applicable in all ca&s;es.</P>
<P>The &s;ea&s;on, the weather, cold, heat, the na|ture of our food, and the greater or le&s;s degree of our exerci&s;e, require more or le&s;s drink at one time than at another. Thir&s;t, however,
<PB N="100" REF="039111_0423_1013A20A30B5A290">
is as good, if not a better guide than hunger; and he who is accu&s;tomed to drink water only, will not ea&s;ily tran&s;gre&s;s the mea&s;ure, if he drink as often as nature calls upon him. With a proper choice of food, every one would drink conformably to his wants. Hence it is needle&s;s to recommend water as a beverage to per&s;ons who will not be per&s;uaded to change their irregular mode of eating.</P>
<P>The more we eat in quantity, and the drier our victuals are, the more we ought to drink. The phlegmatic have le&s;s inclination to drink than tho&s;e of a &s;anguine and choleric tempera|ment. The laborious ought to drink more than the &s;edentary, and &s;till more in &s;ummer than in winter, to &s;upply the humours lo&s;t by in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration.</P>
<P>In the morning when we ri&s;e, we generally feel an inclination for drink, which is relieved by tea, coffee, or other warm liquors. Water would unque&s;tionably be a more proper bev|erage at this time; and I venture to &s;ay, it would be di&s;agreeable to tho&s;e only, who&s;e &s;tomachs are &s;poiled by the habitual u&s;e of warm liquors and hot rolls. A gla&s;s of pure fre&s;h water, and a while after it, a piece of bread with &s;ome fruit, or even butter, would afford a very whole&s;ome breakfa&s;t, by which the &s;tomach and the inte&s;tines might be clear|ed, the blood and humours refre&s;hed, and the whole body &s;trengthened. If the &s;tomach be not loaded with mucus, or relaxed by tippling, a ba&s;on of &s;weet cow's milk, with a piece of &s;tale bread, is an excellent breakfa&s;t in Spring and Summer.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="039111_0424_1013A20BB79F8468">
To drink immediately before a meal, is im|proper, becau&s;e the &s;tomach is thereby &s;welled, and rendered le&s;s fit for the dige&s;tion of food. Hence, to avoid the nece&s;&s;ity of drinking, it is advi&s;able, not to take any violent exerci&s;e immediately before dinner. To drink much at night, previous to our going to bed, is likewi&s;e hurtful. But the drinking before a meal is more noxious than at any other time; becau&s;e the &s;tomach is filled with the liquid we &s;wallow; the bile and the ga&s;tric juice there collected are too much diluted; and con&s;equently the important office of dige&s;|tion is checked.</P>
<P>To drink much during the time of taking food is al&s;o objectionable, as the &s;tomach is thus rendered incapable of receiving the due portion of aliment. Cold beer or water does not well agree with warm victuals; and the teeth are injured by taking hot and cold &s;ub|&s;tances in immediate &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. In the hot weather of Summer, it is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to delay drinking till the dinner be fini&s;hed; and it is the more nece&s;&s;ary, or rather le&s;s hurtful, at this time, as the bile which &s;erves to di&s;&s;olve the victuals, then requires greater dilution. In Winter, unle&s;s we eat very dry and &s;alted provi&s;ions, we feel le&s;s inclined to drink at table. But if we mu&s;t drink in the intervals of eating, it would be mo&s;t conducive to di|ge&s;tion to drink water only, and in &s;mall quan|tities; as pure water is more proper during the time of eating, becau&s;e it agrees with all di&s;hes without exception. Yet a gla&s;s or two of wine, during dinner, particularly for the aged
<PB N="102" REF="039111_0425_1013A250171B5050">
and debilitated, is proper and conducive to dige&s;tion.</P>
<P>Some advi&s;e us never to drink without eat|ing &s;omething; but he who drinks only when nature requires it, has no occa&s;ion to eat every time he drinks. Per&s;ons, on the contrary, who are once accu&s;tomed to drink more than is ne|ce&s;&s;ary, or to make u&s;e of hot, &s;timulating, and intoxicating liquors, would do well to eat al|ways &s;ome bread or other &s;olid food along with them. Indeed we ought to begin to drink only after our appetite for food is &s;atis|fied, and then it &s;hould be done gradually during dige&s;tion. This function may be di&s;|turbed by large draughts of liquor, which oc|ca&s;ion fermentation and flatulency.&mdash;Gla&s;s is the mo&s;t proper &s;ub&s;tance for drinking-ve&s;&s;els; for no other but the fluoric acid will affect it.&mdash;For the &s;ake of delicacy, as well as health, every per&s;on at table ought to be furni&s;hed with a &s;eparate gla&s;s or other ve&s;&s;el for his drink.</P>
<P>Much drink loads and oppre&s;&s;es the &s;tomach, as it di&s;tends it too much; but it is not nearly &s;o hurtful as too much food. Every beverage relaxes the &s;tomach; and per&s;ons who&s;e bow|els are not &s;ufficiently cla&s;&s;ic, &s;hould be careful in the quantity they drink; for an immoderate proportion of it may weaken dige&s;tion, dilute the fluids too much, and conduct the food too quickly through the alimentary canal. An undue portion of drink renders the ma&s;s of the blood too thin and watery; from a thin blood ari&s;es al&s;o a weak alimentary fluid, con|&s;equently a general debility of the body, and relaxation of the urinary and other pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="039111_0426_1013A20F61FA2E60">
On the other hand, too little drink is equal|ly improper; dige&s;tion is weakened; many parts of victuals remain undi&s;&s;olved, and are not conducted to the lacteals, becau&s;e the proper means of diluting them are wanting; the blood becomes thick and vi&s;cid; and fi|nally, the &s;ecretions and excretions are not duly performed, becau&s;e the different canals are too dry and contracted.</P>

<HEAD>II. With re&s;pect to its Quality.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is as great a diver&s;ity among the kinds of beverage, as there is among tho&s;e of food: water it&s;elf is of very different qualities, according to the particles with which it is im|pregnated, and the places from which it is ob|tained. That of wells, &s;prings, rivers, lakes, &s;wamps, and the various mineral waters, all differ in their &s;en&s;ible properties. Even cold and warm water produce different effects. The former, when moderately u&s;ed, &s;trength|ens the &s;tomach, and proves debilitating only when it is drunk in too large quantities. Warm water is always relaxing, and &s;till more &s;o when taken in a large quantity; it remains longer in the &s;tomach than cold water, and con|&s;equently is more oppre&s;&s;ive; cold liquor &s;tim|ulates the &s;tomach, but warm drink dimini&s;h|es its ela&s;ticity.</P>
<P>If the &s;tomach be overfilled with drink, and its ela&s;ticity weakened, a gla&s;s of &s;trong wine, or other &s;pirituous liquor, may remedy this inconvenience.&mdash;Water can only &s;o far be called nouri&s;hing, as it &s;upplies the aqueous parts we continually lo&s;e. It is the ba&s;is of
<PB N="104" REF="039111_0427_1013A252A2E2C940">
all other liquids, and the greater proportion of water they contain, the more fit they are to promote dige&s;tion.</P>
<P><HI>Spring-water</HI> originates partly from that of the &s;ea, which has been changed into vapours by &s;ubterraneous heat, and partly from the atmo&s;phere. As it is di&s;&s;olved, purified, and filtered in a variety of ways, before it becomes vi&s;ible to us, it is lighter and purer than other waters.</P>
<P><HI>Well-water</HI> is more or le&s;s pure, according as it pa&s;&s;es over beds of earth, which contain &s;oluble, or minute particles. Wells opened in a &s;andy &s;oil are the pure&s;t, becau&s;e the wa|ter is there mo&s;t completely filtered. The more frequently a well is u&s;ed, the better its water, provided that no impure &s;ub&s;tances are introduced into it; for, the longer water &s;tands unmoved, it turns the &s;ooner putrid.

<P><HI>River-water</HI> is more pure and whole&s;ome, if it flows over a &s;andy and &s;tony &s;oil, than if it pa&s;s over muddy beds, or through towns, vil|lages, and fore&s;ts, from which it receives many impure &s;ub&s;tances: the water is rendered foul by fi&s;hes, amphibious animals, and plants. La&s;tly, the more rapid the cour&s;e of the river, the ea&s;ier it clears it&s;elf of feculent particles, and the water becomes purer.</P>

<P>The water, which in ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity is ob|tained from <HI>&s;wamps</HI> or <HI>ditches,</HI> is the wor&s;t of all; becau&s;e a great variety of impurities are collected in it, which in a &s;tagnant water and a &s;oft &s;oil readily putrify.

<P><HI>Rain-water</HI> is al&s;o impure, as it contains many &s;aline and oily particles, &s;oon putrifies, and principally con&s;i&s;ts of the joint exhalations of animals, vegetables, and minerals, of an im|men&s;e number and variety of &s;mall in&s;ects and their eggs, &s;eeds of plants, and the like.&mdash;Rain-water is particularly impure in places filled with many noxious vapours, &s;uch as mar&s;hy countries, and large manufacturing towns, where the fumes of metallic and other &s;ub&s;tances are mixed with rain. In high and elevated &s;ituations, at a di&s;tance from impure exhalations, if no &s;trong winds blow, and after a gentle &s;hower, rain-water is then pure&s;t; be|cau&s;e the vapours of the atmo&s;phere have al|ready &s;ub&s;ided.

<P>As the health of man principally depends on the purity and &s;alubrity of the water he u&s;es, we ought, where nece&s;&s;ary, to deprive it of its pernicious qualities; and this can be done by boiling, filtering, and mo&s;t effectually by di&s;|tillation. The putrid &s;ub&s;tances in the water may be corrected by the addition of an acid. Thus, half an ounce of alum in powder, will make twelve gallons of corrupted water pure and tran&s;parent in two hours, without impart|ing a &s;en&s;ible degree of a&s;tringency. By the addition of a very &s;mall quantity of quick lime, water may be pre&s;erved from corruption in long voyages: or, to prevent water from putre&s;cence at &s;ea, add a &s;mall quantity of alkali and vitriolic acid to every ca&s;k, which will pre&s;erve it pure and whole&s;ome for a twelve month. Charcoal-powder has al&s;o been found to be excellently adapted to check the putrid tendency of water, and for this rea&s;on the &s;laves of the ca&s;ks, u&s;ed on &s;hipboard, ought to be well burnt in the in&s;ide, to keep the water from corrupting. Vinegar, or other &s;trong acids, are al&s;o well calculated to cor|rect putrid water; and may be either mixed with it, or drunk immediately after, to pre|vent its bad effects.</P>

<HI>Wine,</HI> that &s;alutiferous liquor to the infirm and the aged, may be divided into <HI>five</HI> prin|cipal cla&s;&s;es:</P>
<P>1&s;t, The <HI>&s;weet wines,</HI> for in&s;tance, tho&s;e of Hungary, Spain, Italy, Greece; the Mala|ga, Malm&s;ey, Madeira, and Cape wines. If the&s;e be genuine; if they have not been adul|terated by the addition of &s;ugar or honey, &amp;c. if they have been properly fermented, they af|ford a true medicine to the weak and con|vale&s;cent.</P>

<P>3d, The <HI>acid</HI> and <HI>tart wines;</HI> among which are mo&s;t of the wines of Franconia, Thuringia, Saxony, Sile&s;ia, and &s;ome parts of Branden|burg. The&s;e wines, in general, are apt to occa&s;ion head-achs, complaints of the &s;tomach, and are be&s;ides of an unplea&s;ant ta&s;te.</P>
<P>4th, The <HI>acidulated &s;weet wines,</HI> particu|larly tho&s;e of France, as the common white wine and claret, are whole&s;ome, provided that they be neither too old nor too new; and</P>

<PB N="108" REF="039111_0431_1013A255ADBADD08">
but the artificial wines of this country are, in general, liable to many &s;trong objec|tions. Among our home-made, wines may be reckoned Cyder and Perry, which are prop|erly wines of Apples and Pears. Cyder and Perry are, it is &s;aid, generally fermented and kept in leaden ve&s;&s;els, or at lea&s;t the Apples and Pears are pa&s;&s;ed through leaden tubes; and the lead being readily di&s;&s;olved by the acid, is gradually introduced into the body, which produces painful and dangerous colics, and frequently gives ri&s;e to the mo&s;t de&s;per|ate and incurable ob&s;tipations, among tho&s;e habituated to the free u&s;e of the&s;e liquors.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the con&s;tituent parts of wine, I &s;hall only remark, that every kind con&s;i&s;ts of three principal ingredients, <HI>water, alcohol,</HI> or a pure &s;pirit, and <HI>&s;ugar.</HI> If the&s;e three &s;ub&s;tances could be &s;o intimately com|bined as they are in wines, and if afterwards the proper aromatics were added, to impart to them the particular flavour, there is no doubt, but we could perfectly imitate every wine whatever. But the greate&s;t ob&s;tacle to this &s;peculation is the length of time, which wines require to arrive at a proper &s;tate of maturity, and which, in made wines, ought to be &s;till further prolonged.</P>
<P>The more water the wine contains, it is the more &s;uitable beverage at table, and, when weak, it is in &s;ome degree calculated to quench thir&s;t. The &s;trong wines, on the contrary, excite thir&s;t, as they are drying, and affect the organs of &s;ecretion. As every kind of wine contains a greater or le&s;s quantity of acid, it
<PB N="109" REF="039111_0432_1013A21765325E90">
is an excellent anti&s;eptic remedy, and hence it is given copiou&s;ly in putrid ulcers and ma|lignant fevers. Moderately u&s;ed, it increa&s;es the circulation of the fluids, and dilates the blood-ve&s;&s;els, promotes both the &s;ecretions and excretions, and invigorates all the functions of the body. Every motion is performed with greater vivacity, as is obvious from the addi|tional lu&s;tre of the eyes. But the &s;trength and vigour which wine imparts to the body, is of no longer duration, than while it remains in the &s;tomach, before it enters into the ma&s;s of the blood, and while the &s;timulus received by the nerves of the &s;tomach, is propagated to the brain. This explains the cau&s;e, that &s;trong liquors are &s;o intoxicating, when drunk upon an empty &s;tomach.</P>
<P>That wine operates on and through the &s;tomach, is clear from experience; for an emetic taken immediately after it, will &s;oon make a drunken man &s;ober. But if its &s;pir|ituous parts be communicated to the blood, &s;o as to occa&s;ion fluctuations, the body be|comes di&s;ordered, weak, and relaxed. It is only a &s;timulant, and not a permanently &s;trengthening cordial; for mo&s;t wine-drink|ers, who indulge in exce&s;s, die of relaxation and debility. There may, however, be ca&s;es in which an occa&s;ional exce&s;s of this kind will be &s;alutary; for in&s;tance, to a per&s;on who has been long &s;itting at &s;tudy, or who&s;e mind is depre&s;&s;ed, and who&s;e fluids are nearly &s;tag|nating: as pa&s;&s;ions &s;ometimes conduce to an|imate the mind, and tempe&s;ts to purify the atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="039111_0433_1013A347D15D9650">
The <HI>&s;tate of intoxication</HI> is in every re&s;pect &s;imilar to that of incipient apoplexy or pal&s;y.&mdash;Drunken men &s;tagger in various directions, their tongue lo&s;es its power of &s;peech; they &s;tammer, and &s;ee things double and moving circularly. The mind is equally affected, and imbecility is the concomitant effect. All the&s;e partial pal&s;ies ari&s;e from the pre&s;&s;ure of the blood-ve&s;&s;els on the brain, which are then &s;ur|charged with blood. If the intoxication has arrived at its utmo&s;t height, there is no longer any difference between this and the true apo|plexy; all the other organs are parali&s;ed, ex|cept the heart, which continues its action, and breathing is not &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. The imprudent &s;ufferer is deprived of &s;en&s;ation, and if one of the &s;maller blood-ve&s;&s;els, that pre&s;s on the brain with an unu&s;ual weight, &s;hould accident|ally bur&s;t, he is in danger of in&s;tant death. But &s;till more frequently does one of the pulmonary ve&s;&s;els bur&s;t, and occa&s;ion &s;pitting of blood.</P>
<P>In drinking, al&s;o much depends on the bod|ily con&s;titution and other circum&s;tances.&mdash;Thus, people are &s;oone&s;t intoxicated in a cold place, where per&s;piration is checked, and when the blood is moving from the external to the internal parts. The &s;ame is the ca&s;e on an empty &s;tomach, but this may be pre|vented by eating a little at intervals, e&s;pecial|ly fat or oily &s;ub&s;tances. Individuals of much &s;en&s;ibility and irritability, and per&s;ons after having taken violent exerci&s;e, are more liable to intoxication, than tho&s;e of a calm and a phlegmatic temperament.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="039111_0434_1013A295A54EC800">
For the&s;e rea&s;ons, a per&s;on much inebriated ought to be carried without delay into a tem|perate room, and placed in a bed between the blankets, with his head rai&s;ed, in order to promote the circulation of the blood, from the head and the internal organs towards the &s;ur|face of the body and the lower extremities. All clo&s;e bandages of the &s;hirt and garters mu&s;t be loo&s;ed, and the feet &s;hould be bathed in luke|warm water, not exceeding the ninety-eighth degree of Farenheit. Plenty of tea or other diluent drink ought to be given, and a gentle emetic is frequently of great &s;ervice.</P>
<P>After a good &s;leep, which has overcome the intoxication, the whole body feels weak and tremulous; and the &s;tomach di&s;ordered. In this &s;tate, per&s;ons are generally troubled with much acid in the dige&s;tive organ, which may be removed by the ab&s;orbent earths, &s;uch as magne&s;ia; after which, &s;ome &s;edative and &s;trengthening remedies may be given, &s;uch as hot red-wine negus, warm ale with ginger, &s;trong coffee, and the like.</P>
<P>The copious u&s;e of wine, though not to a degree of inebriation, is exceedingly debilita|ting to the &s;tomach, checking dige&s;tion, excit|ing diarrhoea, if white-wine, and ob&s;tructions, if port-wine be the favorite liquor; it makes the fibres dry and rigid; the cheeks and the whole &s;urface of the body turn &s;allow, a &s;ymp|tom of bad dige&s;tion; the powers of the body and mind are enfeebled, and drop&s;y or gout, and &s;ometimes &s;udden death, are the con&s;e|quences. Plethoric young men, and &s;uch as have weak &s;tomachs and lungs, &s;hould not ac|cu&s;tom

them&s;elves to the u&s;e of wine. To give it to infants or children, is a practice highly pernicious, except in very &s;mall quantities in|deed. In &s;hort, wine &s;hould be u&s;ed as a med|icine only, if intended to produce &s;alutary ef|fects. To the phlegmatic, to the aged, and to tho&s;e who are di&s;po&s;ed to flatulency, and after fat meat, it is highly beneficial, if u&s;ed with prudence and moderation.</P>
<P>As wine encourages per&s;piration, it dries the body, makes it lean, and may therefore be of &s;ervice to cold and phlegmatic con&s;titutions. It &s;timulates the bile, and excites the appetite to a repetition of exce&s;s, &s;o that per&s;ons once habituated to drinking can but gradually re|linqui&s;h this &s;eductive practice. To drink wine copiou&s;ly every day, is as improper and perni|cious as to take medicines by way of diet: nothing is &s;o much calculated to occa&s;ion hab|itual indige&s;tion. And as wines are frequent|ly adulterated with &s;ugar of lead, and other poi&s;onous ingredients, to render them more agreeable to the palate, I propo&s;e to be&s;tow &s;ome attention on this important &s;ubject, in order to enable the reader to detect &s;uch per|nicious mixtures, which may expo&s;e his health, and even life it&s;elf to the greate&s;t danger.</P>
<P>Some of the adulterations of wine are rather harmle&s;s, others extremely dangerous. The common red-wines are frequently made of new, tart, and half-&s;poiled white wines, by tinging them with red &s;umach, or other woods and berries. In order to make wines &s;tronger and more pungent, a variety of &s;pices are employ|ed, &s;uch as galangal, cardamom, mace, and
<PB N="113" REF="039111_0436_1013A2984778CFB0">
the like; or an unfermented mu&s;t, wort, or the ma&s;h for di&s;tilling &s;pirits, are occa&s;ionally added, and allowed to ferment together with impure wines. To impart to wine the flavor of mu&s;cadel, the leaves of the <HI>Horminum,</HI> a &s;pe|cies of Sage (<HI>Salvia Horminium,</HI> L.) are often u&s;ed; though it be a plant of a &s;trong &s;tupify|ing &s;mell, and very pernicious effects.</P>
<P>All adulterated wines, and what we call Briti&s;h wines, if drunk in any quantity, are more or le&s;s detrimental to health. For, even by the mo&s;t innocent mode of preparing them in large quantities, the manufacturers are in|duced to &s;ea&s;on them with &s;pices of a heating and &s;timulating nature. But the mo&s;t deleteri|ous of all adulterations of wine, is that with the various preparations of lead, to give it a &s;weet ta&s;te. This infamous practice was carried on, &s;ome years ago, in Paris, to &s;uch an extent, that the Exci&s;e-office could not account for the prodigious increa&s;e of Vinegar entered at the city-gates. But it was at length di&s;cover|ed, that this vinegar con&s;i&s;ted only of tart and adulterated wines, imported under the pre|tended character of vinegar, in order to avoid the high duty impo&s;ed upon wines, on their entrance into Paris: and &s;ugar of lead, joined to &s;ome ab&s;orbent earths, was employed to change the&s;e vinegars into &s;weet wines, which de&s;troyed the lives of many thou&s;and per&s;ons. This &s;ecret of the utmo&s;t importance to health and life, was confe&s;&s;ed by a rich old wine-mer|chant, on his death-bed, to relieve in &s;ome de|gree his tortured con&s;cience.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="039111_0437_1013A25839CA9DE0">
Such adulterated wines operate like &s;low poi&s;ons; they fir&s;t occa&s;ion head-ach, con|traction of the throat, pain of the &s;tomach, unea&s;ine&s;s, cough, difficulty of breathing; af|terwards colics, and particularly the dry bel|ly-ach, with continual ob&s;tipations, and at length pal&s;y, convul&s;ions, con&s;umption, and death.&mdash;The bra&s;s cocks al&s;o, which are by &s;ome people u&s;ed to draw of wine or cyder, are of the mo&s;t dangerous tendency; as they ea&s;ily yield and mix their verdigri&s;e with the liquor.</P>
<P>To detect adulterated wines, we mu&s;t at|tend to the following particulars: every white or &s;traw-coloured wine of a &s;weeti&s;h ta&s;te, af|terwards a&s;tringent, and at the &s;ame time new; every wine that has an unu&s;ually high colour, not in proportion to its &s;trength and age, or if it has the flavour of brandy, penetrates the tongue, or la&s;tly, if it has an uncommonly &s;trong flavour, may be ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pected of adul|teration.&mdash;Red wines, either of a very deep or a very faint colour; of a woody or tart ta&s;te; and tho&s;e which cover the inner &s;urface of the gla&s;s, as well as the bottom of the bot|tles, with a red &s;ediment, are generally tinged with &s;ome colouring &s;ub&s;tances. If &s;uch a wine be pa&s;&s;ed through filtering paper, the colouring particles will remain behind on the paper.</P>
<P>By the following method, we may ea&s;ily di&s;cover, whether wines be adulterated, or col|oured, with burnt &s;ugar, rai&s;ins, whortle-ber|ries, and the like. A &s;mall phial mu&s;t be fill|ed with the &s;u&s;pected wine; the opening is
<PB N="115" REF="039111_0438_1013A29BD8DEC688">
&s;topped with the finger, and the phial, being inverted, is plunged into a tumbler of water; the finger being withdrawn from the mouth of the phial, if the wine be adulterated the &s;ub&s;tance with which this is done, will vi&s;ibly e&s;cape from the phial, and mix with the wa|ter; in &s;o far at lea&s;t, as the addition is heav|ier than water, which is generally the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e adulterations, however, are of little detriment to health, if they contain no <HI>metallic</HI> particles. In order to di&s;cover the&s;e, we are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an excellent chemical te&s;t, contriv|ed by Prof. HAHNEMANN, in Germany, and known by the name of <HI>Liquor vini probatorius.</HI> It is prepared as follows: One drachm of the dry liver of &s;ulphur, and two drachms of cream of tartar, are &s;haken in two ounces of di&s;tilled water, till it be completely &s;aturated with he|patic air: the liquor is then filtered through blotting paper, and kept in a clo&s;e &s;topped phial. From &s;ixteen to twenty drops of this liquid are dropped into a &s;mall gla&s;s, filled with wine that is &s;u&s;pected to have been adul|terated. If the wine turn only thick with white clouds, and depo&s;it no other but a white &s;ediment, we may be certain that it contains no metallic ingredients whatever; but if it turn black, or even dark, if its colour ap|proach that of a dark red, if it have fir&s;t a &s;weet, and then an a&s;tringent ta&s;te, it is cer|tainly impregnated with &s;ugar of lead, or &s;ome other preparation of that metal equally de|&s;tructive. If, however, the dark colour be of a blui&s;h ca&s;t, not unlike that of pale ink, we may &s;u&s;pect the wine to contain iron in its
<PB N="116" REF="039111_0439_1013A25CF37A7B68">
compo&s;ition. La&s;tly, if the wine be impreg|nated with copper or verdigri&s;e, it will depo&s;it a &s;ediment of a blacki&s;h grey colour. This experiment ought to be made with a fre&s;h-prepared te&s;t, and in the open air.</P>
<P>It further merits attention, that white wines are very frequently coloured with burnt &s;ugar and other vegetable bodies; they acquire a darker colour by being kept in oak ca&s;ks, or by containing much tartar; and in all the&s;e ca&s;es they will be made &s;omewhat darker by the above de&s;cribed te&s;t; but the &s;ediment will not be of an uniform colour, and will con&s;i&s;t only of &s;ome brown &s;treaks.&mdash;It is well known, that all white wines mu&s;t be impreg|nated with a &s;mall quantity of &s;ulphur, in or|der to pre&s;erve them: if this be done in mod|eration, it is not detrimental to health; but if too great a proportion of &s;ulphur be u&s;ed, &s;uch wine occa&s;ions great heat and thir&s;t, it &s;oon intoxicates, produces eruptions of the &s;kin and face, head-ach, trembling of the limbs, and palpitation of the heart, hemor|rhoidal complaints, gout, and a variety of nervous &s;ymptoms. Nothing is &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;|covered as &s;ulphur; for by putting a piece of &s;ilver, or even the &s;hell of an egg, into an over|&s;ulpherated wine, it will in&s;tantly turn black.</P>
<P>Wines are &s;ometimes adulterated by mixing quick-lime with them, in order to produce a beautiful ruby-colour. If &s;uch a wine be poured into a tumbler, and allowed to &s;tand for a day or two, a thin cru&s;t or pellicle will be formed on the top, by which the lime held in &s;olution will be detected. It is affirmed
<PB N="117" REF="039111_0440_1013A29D5C948F10">
that &s;uch wines, if u&s;ed for any length of time, bring on gouty and gravelly complaints.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t innocent adulteration of wine, and perhaps the mo&s;t frequent, is that with water. If a &s;mall quantity of wine be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> on quick|lime, and if the lime be &s;lackened by it, the wine then certainly contains water. But if the lime continues whole, the wine is pure and unmixed.</P>
<P><HI>Ardent &s;pirits</HI> compri&s;e all tho&s;e liquors ob|tained by fermenting vegetable, and particu|larly farinaceous &s;ub&s;tances, to a certain de|gree, and afterwards &s;ubjecting them to di&s;til|lation. All di&s;tilled liquors con&s;i&s;t of a great proportion of alcohol or pure &s;pirit, a greater or le&s;s quantity of water, and generally of a very &s;mall proportion of an empyreumatic oil, e&s;pecially if di&s;tilled once only, or if this pro|ce&s;s be carried on too quickly. Pure &s;pirits are perfectly free from this oil, which, from its burnt and acrid nature, is altogether indi|ge&s;tible. Proof &s;pirits ought to con&s;i&s;t of 55 parts of alcohol, and 45 of di&s;tilled water in 100: but rectified &s;pirits of wine ought to have only 5 parts of water in the hundred: the &s;pecific gravity of the former being as 930, and that of the latter as 835, to 1000.</P>
<P>The intoxicating effects of &s;pirits are but too well known; if they be di&s;tilled over pepper|mint, balm, anni&s;eed, or carraway, their &s;trength is not much increa&s;ed; but if over cinnamon, cloves, mace, or other hot &s;pices, they are rendered &s;till more heating, and per|nicious to health.</P>

If drunk in hot weather, or after violent per&s;piration, they check this function, by con|tracting the ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin, and clo&s;ing the pores.

We may be convinced of this, by attending to the effects they produce on inan|imate &s;ub&s;tances: for the&s;e are pre&s;erved from di&s;&s;olution and putrefaction more effectually in &s;pirits, than in any other liquid. Thus we may learn, that &s;pirits will impede dige&s;|tion, and render &s;trong food taken into the &s;tomach &s;till more indige&s;tible. Many per&s;ons are accu&s;tomed to take a dram as a remedy again&s;t flatulency: if the &s;tomach be clean and undepraved, they will certainly be relieved by it; but, in the contrary ca&s;e, their expecta|tions will be di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>Ardent &s;pirits are rendered &s;till more con|tracting, and prejudicial to the &s;tomach, when combined with acids, as in punch; and, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, the habit of taking drams after fruit, or any acid vegetable, is ab&s;urd. Notwith&s;tanding the frequent abu&s;e of &s;pirits, they afford one of the mo&s;t excellent anti&s;ep|tics; but, if the human body be already re|plete

with vitiated humours, and troubled with frequent eructations, it is too late to cure it with gin or brandy.

<P>To per&s;ons of relaxed fibres, di&s;tilled liquors may, under certain limitations, be u&s;eful, as they increa&s;e the ela&s;ticity and com|pactne&s;s of the ve&s;&s;els.

in proportion to the quantity, quality, and man|ner of compounding them, it has received differ|ent names, and is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of various degrees of &s;alubrity.

<P>The greater or le&s;s addition of hops to the malt, furni&s;hes us with bitter or &s;weet beer. The former kind is preferable as a medicine; the latter is more u&s;ed as a common beverage; but it is apt to excite flatulency and diarrhoea. Hops, like other bitter &s;ub&s;tances, pre&s;erve beer in its, vinous &s;tate, &s;trengthen the &s;tom|ach, and di&s;&s;olve vi&s;cid phlegm.

<P>There are great varieties in beer, accordingly as it is fermented; &s;ome kinds, &s;uch as tho&s;e made of oats, in &s;ome parts of Germany, which are &s;carcely allowed to ferment at all, are very cooling in &s;ummer, but &s;oon &s;poil; others are only half-fermented, &s;uch as the Dantzig &s;pruce or black beer; others again

to a &s;ufficient degree, like our porter and ale; and la&s;tly &s;ome, which are more than &s;uffi|ciently fermented, &s;uch as Burton ale, and mo&s;t of the &s;trong home-brewed ales. All the&s;e are different in their effects, according to the various degrees of fermentation.</P>
<P>Every kind of beer is inclined to ferment, on account of its con&s;tituent parts. If it be not properly fermented, this takes place in the &s;tomach it&s;elf; the fixed air, being di&s;en|gaged within the body, di&s;tends the &s;tomach and bowels, and occa&s;ions flatulency and loo&s;e|ne&s;s. However, when drunk in &s;mall quan|tities, it is not attended with any great incon|venience, particularly in &s;ummer, or in hot climates. It is u&s;ed with great advantage at &s;ea, again&s;t that great enemy of the mariner, the &s;curvy; tho&s;e per&s;ons who have corrupt|ed gums, that are painful and bleed on the lea&s;t touch, ought to drink half a pint of wort, or unfermented beer, every morning and eve|ning, keeping this liquor for a good while in their mouth; and they may promi&s;e them|&s;elves great benefit from this &s;imple remedy.</P>
<P>Many con&s;ider beer or porter as excellent, when it foams much and makes a head, as it is called, on the top of the ve&s;&s;el; which is drunk by &s;ome tipplers with avidity, before it di&s;appears. But this froth is not a proof of its good quality; but rather of its imper|fect fermentation, which is continued and completed in the &s;tomach. It is likewi&s;e of|ten artificially increa&s;ed, by the addition of improper ingredients. The volatile vapour, or gas, di&s;engaged from &s;uch beer in the &s;to|mach
<PB N="122" REF="039111_0445_1013A262A29F9238">
and bowels, produces a quantity of &s;tim|ulating and contracting air, by which the ali|mentary canal is almo&s;t at the &s;ame time ex|panded and contracted, &s;o that the mo&s;t dan|gerous &s;pa&s;ms and colics may thence ari&s;e. Such beer likewi&s;e emits a quantity of &s;ulphu|reous vapours; and for this rea&s;on it is dan|gerous to go into cellars, where it is kept in a &s;tate of fermentation. A candle will often be extingui&s;hed by the vapour of cellars, which is &s;ometimes &s;o noxious as to &s;uffocate per|&s;ons on their entrance.</P>
<P>If bottles filled with beer, ale, or porter, are not &s;oon enough corked, it turns flat or &s;our, acquires an unplea&s;ant ta&s;te, produces flatulency, colics, and &s;pa&s;ms. If bottled and corked in proper time, the gas which it ought to contain is not di&s;&s;ipated; its agree|ably pungent ta&s;te is pre&s;erved, and it is then a very excellent and nouri&s;hing liquor, which allays thir&s;t, and does not affect dige&s;tion, like wine.&mdash;A per&s;on who has a good appetite, and takes nouri&s;hing food, requires no beer for its dige&s;tion; and, by drinking it, he is expo&s;ed to plethora, or a full habit, and all its concomitant complaints. Tho&s;e, on the contrary, who take a great proportion of veg|etable food, and have a weak &s;tomach, will find a &s;trong and bitter beer &s;alutary.</P>
<P>As every new &s;ort of beer is not equally grateful to the &s;tomach, we would do well to de&s;i&s;t from u&s;ing that kind, to which we can|not habituate our&s;elves in the cour&s;e of two or three weeks. On account of the great variety of this liquor we meet with in travel|ling,
<PB N="123" REF="039111_0446_1013A2A65F386A98">
it is much better to drink no beer at all on journeys, and in&s;tead of it to u&s;e lemonade, in hot weather, and wine or &s;pirits mixed with water, when we travel in a damp and cold &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>Beer, in general, is nouri&s;hing, and has a tendency to fatten &s;uch individuals, as are of dry and rigid fibres, and who&s;e bile is good. Hence the inhabitants of countries, in which beer is the principal beverage, are commonly more phlegmatic and indolent than tho&s;e of wine-countries. Many &s;orts of beer, howev|er, in which a greater than u&s;ual proportion of grain is u&s;ed, contain much &s;pirit, and are of a heating and inebriating nature. Such is, for in&s;tance, our Burton and &s;everal oth|er ales, and all the &s;trong kinds of foreign beer.</P>
<P>Light and well-fermented beer is a whole|&s;ome and, at the &s;ame time, diluent &s;pecies of nouri&s;hment. With per&s;ons already plethoric, or di&s;po&s;ed to become corpulent, the lighte&s;t beer generally agrees be&s;t. Think and nour|i&s;hing beer is of &s;ervice to wet-nur&s;es and the debilitated. Sweet beers are only nouri&s;hing, but all the bitter kinds are &s;trengthening al&s;o. The latter are beneficial in a weak &s;tate of dige&s;tion, and to people troubled with acid in the &s;tomach; yet &s;weet beer is more whole|&s;ome for daily u&s;e, and at the &s;ame time le&s;s expo&s;ed to dangerous adulterations. In &s;hort, beer is no proper beverage for people of a thick, black-bilious blood, and with a di&s;po|&s;ition to melancholy: it is the mo&s;t u&s;eful &s;pecies of drink to the weak, the lean, and the
<PB N="124" REF="039111_0447_1013A26771FB9BC8">
laborious; provided they are not very &s;ubject to flatulency, nor troubled with di&s;ea&s;es of the brea&s;t. In both of the&s;e ca&s;es, I have found it uniformly to di&s;agree, and to be much in|ferior in &s;alubrity to water.</P>
<P>A moderate u&s;e of fermented or di&s;tilled &s;pirituous liquors is far le&s;s prejudicial to the con&s;titution, than the habitual and exce&s;&s;ive drinking of warm liquors. <HI>Tea,</HI> the common favourite among all ranks, if taken regularly twice a day, and in large quantities, is attend|ed with bad con&s;equences. It thoroughly re|laxes the coats of the &s;tomach, weakens the bowels, predi&s;po&s;es them to flatulency upon the lea&s;t occa&s;ion, and de&s;troys all the energy of the dige&s;tive organ. The&s;e effects, how|ever, are not &s;o frequent, nor indeed to that extent, if the tea be drank &s;trong, &s;ufficiently diluted with milk, and &s;weetened with &s;ugar: it is chiefly the warm water, which renders the tea of the common people &s;o de&s;tructive to the con&s;titution, as they generally make up for the indifferent quality of the tea, by the quan|tity of water.</P>
<P>The tea-leaf, which has employed the pens of &s;o many eminent writers, &s;till de&s;erves &s;ome attention; as the nature and properties of it are but imperfectly under&s;tood. It certainly is an aromatic, &s;lightly a&s;tringent, and &s;ome|what narcotic plant. Whether it po&s;&s;e&s;s any diuretic, diaphoretic, and other virtues, for which it has been celebrated, is rather doubtful; as the&s;e may be in part owing to the great quantities of warm water, with which the infu&s;ions of it are made. Good tea, par|ticularly the black &s;ort, in moderate quantity,
<PB N="125" REF="039111_0448_1013A2A7E40BA558">
and made &s;trong, is anti&s;pa&s;modic and refre&s;h|ing. It is, therefore, calculated to relieve the cramp of the &s;tomach, and pains of the abdo|men, if they proceed from flatulency. But, according to circum&s;tances, it may even in|crea&s;e &s;pa&s;modic contractions; for in&s;tance, if it ari&s;e from a vitiated bile, from worms, or from hy&s;teric and gouty complaints; in all which ca&s;es tea will mo&s;t certainly not re|lieve, but rather prolong the &s;pa&s;modic con|traction of the ve&s;&s;els. The relaxation which tea occa&s;ions in the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages, renders it peculiarly hurtful to females of lax fibres, a thin blood, and irritable habits. To enumerate the great diver&s;ity of nervous &s;ymptoms, at|tending its abu&s;e in &s;uch con&s;titutions, would lead me too far from the pre&s;cribed limits; but &s;o much is certain, that the vapours ari&s;ing from liquors drunk very hot like tea, weaken the lungs, and di&s;po&s;e their votaries to frequent colds and cararrhs, which readily make a tran&s;i|tion into con&s;umptions.</P>
<P>Individuals of a rigid and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words">, of a dry and firm body, may be allowed to drink tea in moderation, as it will not ea&s;ily hurt them. By adding a table-&s;poonful of old Rheni&s;h wine, or ardent &s;pirits, to every cup of tea, it may be &s;o far improved, as to make it le&s;s flatulent; but the frequent repetition of it, even in this form, mu&s;t be detrimental to the body. A moderate u&s;e of tea may &s;ometimes be of &s;ervice to per&s;ons in a perfect &s;tate of health; yet, for daily u&s;e, it cannot be recom|mended. It doubtle&s;s occa&s;ions a gentle &s;tim|ulus, and rou&s;es the mind for a &s;hort time;
<PB N="126" REF="039111_0449_1013A268F758F5E8">
hence it is perhaps the be&s;t and &s;afe&s;t refre&s;h|ment after violent heat and fatigue of the body. As the means of increa&s;ing per&s;piration, tea is an u&s;eful beverage to travellers in cold weather, when in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration is liable to be checked.</P>
<P>Hypochondriac and hy&s;teric people, how|ever, are much deceived in the efficacy of tea, as a diluent drink; for all the evils ari&s;ing from relaxation, a weak &s;tomach, and flatulency, under which &s;uch per&s;ons u&s;ually labour, are, by the habit of drinking tea, increa&s;ed to the mo&s;t alarming degree. The <HI>cold</HI> &s;tomach, which they propo&s;e to <HI>warm</HI> by it, is a mere phantom of the brain; for this &s;en&s;ation of cold is nothing but relaxation, which cannot be removed by <HI>hot</HI> liquors, but is increa&s;ed by every repetition of them.</P>
<P>It would be a great proof of a patriotic &s;pirit in this country, if the u&s;e of this exotic drug were either altogether abandoned, or, at lea&s;t, &s;upplied by &s;ome indigenous plants of equal flavour, and &s;uperior &s;alubrity. The Chine&s;e have good rea&s;on to &s;mile at our degenerate ta&s;te, when they are informed, that we actu|ally po&s;&s;e&s;s an immen&s;e variety of the mo&s;t valuable aromatic plants, much better calcu|lated by nature to invigorate our &s;tomachs, and to revive our &s;pirits, than tea, which we purcha&s;e from them at great expen&s;e. The&s;e &s;entiments may be ungrateful to tea-dealers, or Ea&s;t-India merchants, but every hone&s;t truth &s;hould be candidly told to an unbia&s;&s;ed public.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="039111_0450_1013A2AA8BE3F9D0">
It would undoubtedly be more conducive to our health, if we could altogether di&s;pen&s;e with the u&s;e of warm liquors, at lea&s;t when in a &s;tate of health. But, if this practice mu&s;t be indulged in, we ought to choo&s;e the herbs growing in our own meadows and gardens, in|&s;tead of making our&s;elves tributary to di&s;tant nations. With this intention, the late Dr. Solander introduced his <HI>Sanative Tea;</HI> not with a view of making it a &s;ecret or quack|medicine, under which character it is now &s;old in this country, but of recommending the u&s;e of it to tho&s;e individuals who require dilu|ent liquors, and to the heavy, &s;luggi&s;h, and phlegmatic. Dr. Ti&s;&s;ot had previou&s;ly recom|mended the &s;talks of cherries, and the leaves of peach and almond trees, to the poor people of Switzerland, as &s;ub&s;titutes for tea; but we po&s;&s;e&s;s a variety of plants infinitely &s;uperior to the&s;e, of which I have my&s;elf occa&s;ionally made trial. I &s;hall divide the&s;e into three cla&s;&s;es; namely,</P>
<P>1&s;t, The &s;trong, &s;picy, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> plants, &s;uch as balm, peppermint, &s;age, and the like.</P>
<P>2d, The &s;trongly aromatic flowers, among which tho&s;e of the <HI>Ro&s;a pimpinellae folia</HI> (or the ro&s;e who&s;e leaves re&s;emble tho&s;e of the Burnet-&s;axifrage) and the <HI>wood-roof,</HI> or the <HI>A&s;perula odorata,</HI> L., de&s;erve the fir&s;t place, and far excel in flavour all the teas imported from China; and la&s;tly,</P>
<P>3d, The mild aromatic leaves and blo&s;&s;oms of trees and &s;hrubs, for in&s;tance, the blo&s;&s;oms of the lime-tree and the black thorn, the leaves of the peach and almond-trees, and particu|larly
<PB N="128" REF="039111_0451_1013A26BCFEAA948">
the fir&s;t tender leaves of the <HI>whortle-berries,</HI> or the <HI>Vaccinium Myrtillus,</HI> L., which cannot be di&s;tingui&s;hed from real tea, when properly gathered, and dried in the &s;hade.</P>
<P>After having pointed out the be&s;t &s;ub&s;titutes for Indian Tea, I cannot &s;uppre&s;s my earne&s;t wi&s;h, that even the&s;e indigenous vegetables may not be abu&s;ed by decocting them in too much water, which, when &s;wallowed hot, mu&s;t be detrimental to the &s;tomach, the lungs, the nerves, and the whole human frame. I cannot better conclude this important article, than by quoting the prophetic words of an ex|perienced phy&s;ician.&mdash;"Tea," &s;ays he, "will induce a total change of con&s;titution in the people of this country. Indeed it has gone a great way towards effecting that evil already. A debility, and con&s;equent irritability of fibre, are become &s;o common, that not only women, but even men are affected with them. That cla&s;s of di&s;ea&s;es, which, for want of a better name, we call nervous, has made almo&s;t a complete <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the one &s;ex, and is mak|ing ha&s;ty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> towards vanqui&s;hing the other." And Dr. Buchan emphatically con|cludes: "Did women know the train of di&s;|ea&s;es induced by debility, and how di&s;agreea|ble the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es render them to the other &s;ex, they would &s;hun tea as the mo&s;t deadly poi&s;on. No man can love a woman eaten up with va|pours, or wa&s;hed down with di&s;ea&s;es ari&s;ing from relaxation."</P>
<P><HI>Coffee</HI> is a decoction of the well-known bean or berry of that name, roa&s;ted and ground into a powder. The bitter and a&s;tringent
<PB N="129" REF="039111_0452_1013A2ADCAA455B0">
powers of the beans, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, correct the bad properties of warm water; but if they be too much roa&s;ted, their empyreumatic oil is expelled, and they acquire an in&s;ipid ta&s;te. If, on the other hand, they be not &s;ufficiently roa&s;ted, this burnt oil is not evolved to the &s;ur|face of the bean, and the coffee acquires a bit|ter and unplea&s;ant flavour. This beverage is generally con&s;idered as &s;trengthening to the &s;tomach. It promotes dige&s;tion, di&s;pels flatu|lency, removes vertigo and torpor, exhilarates the mind, increa&s;es the circulation of the blood and in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration, attenuates vi&s;cid humours, is diuretic, and &s;ometimes gently aperient. The&s;e properties of Coffee being, in a great mea&s;ure, confirmed by ex|perience, ju&s;tly make it a valuable medicine, which is eminently qualified to cure the mo&s;t trouble&s;ome head-achs, provided they origin|ate from the &s;tomach, or from a bad &s;tate of concoction. Coffee drunk after dinner pro|motes dige&s;tion; and agues, diarrhoeas, and giddine&s;s, have been frequently <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">moved by it. Its &s;ubtle oil &s;timulates the &s;olids, rarefies the blood, and con&s;equently is of particular &s;ervice to females of a &s;edentary life, and to tho&s;e who &s;uffer from phlegmatic and catarrhal di&s;|ea&s;es. If drank too &s;trong, it affects the nerves, and by its penetrating property often occa&s;ions &s;leeple&s;&s;ne&s;s, and tremor of the hands; but, in &s;ome phlegmatic and indolent individuals, it is apt to excite &s;leep.</P>
<P>If coffee be not u&s;ed merely as a diluent for relaxing the fibres, it ought to be made &s;trong. The be&s;t proportion is, one ounce of
<PB N="130" REF="039111_0453_1013A26E58FBC080">
well-roa&s;ted and ground coffee to one pound or one pint of water, which &s;hould be ju&s;t allowed to boil up: for the longer it is boiled, it lo&s;es the more of its volatile and aromatic particles, and con&s;equently becomes weak and in&s;ipid.&mdash;As coffee is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, of excellent anti&s;pa&s;modic virtues, it is a favourite bever|age with the hypochondriac and the hy&s;teric; and according to early ob&s;ervation, it is al&s;o the be&s;t and mo&s;t effectual remedy in &s;pa&s;|modic a&s;thma.</P>
<P>The &s;team of boiled coffee has frequently been beneficial to weak eyes. If drunk in the morning, and immediately after dinner, of a proper &s;trength, and not above one or two &s;mall cups, it is a whole&s;ome &s;ub&s;titute for tea or &s;pirits, particularly to per&s;ons in a good &s;tate of health, and to &s;uch as are not habitual wine-drinkers, or of a very irritable temper|ament.&mdash;La&s;tly, the coffee of the Levant far excels that imported from the We&s;t Indies, which is frequently &s;teeped in &s;ea-water, in or|der to make it weigh heavier. This fradulent practice may be ea&s;ily detected, by &s;oaking the raw coffee in water, and examining its ta&s;te.</P>
<P>An <HI>immoderate</HI> u&s;e, however, of this decoc|tion is prejudicial to the healthy, and de&s;truc|tive to the di&s;ea&s;ed: it debilitates the latter &s;till more, by cau&s;ing great undulations in the blood, tremor of the limbs, giddine&s;s, and a certain in&s;upportable timidity. It leads peo|ple of a &s;anguine temperament, and particu|larly females, to the long train of all the fa&s;h|ionable nervous di&s;ea&s;es. It frequently occa&s;ions a di&s;agreeable eruption in the face, and brings
<PB N="131" REF="039111_0454_1013A2B1767377E8">
on many trouble&s;ome di&s;orders, occa&s;ions bleedings of the no&s;e, and &s;ometimes &s;pitting of blood, induces frequent hemorrhoids, a hectic cough, and at la&s;t con&s;umption and death.&mdash;If coffee be drunk after dinner, with a view to promote dige&s;tion, it requires no milk to dilute it, and render it weaker: but, if it be u&s;ed for breakfa&s;t, &s;ome milk or cream is nece&s;&s;ary, to &s;heath or neutralize the empy|reumatic oil it contains, which fires the blood, and occa&s;ions violent flu&s;hings, accompanied with choleric &s;en&s;ations.</P>
<P>All the kinds of mock coffee, made of rye, wheat, peas, dried carrots, beet, the &s;uccory-root, and the like, have little re&s;emblance to it, except what they acquire by their burnt ta&s;te and empyreumatic oil. A coffee made of acorns is much recommended in a&s;thmatic and &s;pa&s;modic complaints; but as it contains an uncommon quantity of oil, which is dan|gerous and heating to the blood, too much circum&s;pection cannot be employed in the u&s;e of it.

<P><HI>Chocolate,</HI> e&s;pecially when boiled with milk and eggs, is exceedingly nouri&s;hing: but the &s;pices with which it is mixed, &s;uch as cinna|mon, cloves, mu&s;k, vanilla, and the like, make it more heating and le&s;s whole&s;ome. Vanilla, which we always find in the Spani&s;h Chocolate, is an extremely volatile and pungent aromatic; even its flavour is frequently in&s;upportable to

The common chocolate, prepared with &s;ugar, eggs, milk, and water, is the mo&s;t nutritive and whole&s;ome; but a too frequent and immoderate u&s;e of it is always hurtful, particularly to the individuals before alluded to, as the cacao is too fat and indige&s;tible to them, and creates a fal&s;e or forced appetite. <HI>Cacao,</HI> of it&s;elf, is le&s;s heating and lighter than if made into chocolate, but it is not &s;o nour|i&s;hing. The immoderate u&s;e of this oily bev|erage is apt to induce a febrile &s;tate in young people, and to &s;upply the &s;edentary with &s;u|perfluous nouri&s;hment; while it frequently brings on, like coffee, a &s;tate of irritability and unea&s;ine&s;s. To the corpulent and weak it is improper; and if they be immoderate eat|ers, they are ha&s;tening to contract inflamma|tory di&s;ea&s;es and apoplexies.

In children threatened with a wa&s;ting, or <HI>tabes dor&s;alis,</HI> as likewi&s;e in &s;ome kinds of con&s;ump|tion in adults, Chocolate, with a &s;ufficient quantity of milk, may be beneficial; but even in the&s;e ca&s;es a &s;trong decoction of roa&s;ted

<HEAD>Of Spices.</HEAD>
<P>Spices, of them&s;elves, are not nouri&s;hing, but are u&s;ed merely to improve the ta&s;te and flavour of &s;ub&s;tances, to prevent flatulency, and to promote dige&s;tion. Some &s;pices, being extremely volatile, and occa&s;ioning too &s;trong a &s;timulus, do more harm than good. As they are apt to heat the blood, to increa&s;e per&s;piration, occa&s;ionally to affect the head, and to &s;timulate the nerves, &s;pices, in general, &s;hould be u&s;ed only by per&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a &s;trong con&s;titution, or by tho&s;e of a lax fibre, and cold phlegmatic habit: as, on the contra|ry, individuals naturally lean and dry, as well as the choleric and phlegmatic, ought to be &s;paring and cautious in the u&s;e of heating &s;pices. The mo&s;t conducive to health would be the indigenous &s;pices, though &s;ome of the foreign kind have now become indi&s;pen&s;able in our pre&s;ent mode of living. The mo&s;t com|mon, and perhaps the mo&s;t u&s;eful, are:</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Salt.</HI> It corrodes the fibres of plants and animals, di&s;organizes the connection of parts too firm for the &s;olution of the &s;tomach, di&s;|&s;olves the glutinous parts, and prepares them for being better dige&s;ted by the &s;tomach. Pro|vi&s;ions of a tough and vi&s;cid con&s;i&s;tence, there|fore, require much &s;alt; for in&s;tance, beef, mutton, fi&s;h, peas, beans, fat, &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is little danger of u&s;ing too much &s;alt with <HI>fre&s;h</HI> vict|uals, as the only con&s;equence ari&s;ing from exce&s;s would be a &s;light laxity of the bowels.&mdash;In order to obtain &s;alt as pure as po&s;&s;ible, and free from the bitter magne&s;ia, which is the great promoter of putrefaction, I take this opportunity of recommending an inge|nious and &s;imple proce&s;s lately invented by <HI>Lord Dundonald,</HI> one of the mo&s;t zealous and able cultivators of the u&s;eful arts; Di&s;|&s;olve as much common &s;alt in a given quantity of boiling water as it is capable of containing in &s;olution. Take another quanti|ty of &s;alt not larger than the former, and put it into a gla&s;s fun|nel, or &s;imilar ve&s;&s;el of wood or earthen-ware, which ought to be lined with coar&s;e thick lin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n cloth. While the &s;trong brine is hot, pour it over the dry &s;alt, of which it will not di&s;&s;olve a particle, but merely wa&s;h away the magne&s;ia and other impuri|ties adhering to its &s;urface; and by repeating this effu&s;ion &s;ever|al times, the wa&s;hed &s;alt will become tolerably pure. The whole of this proce&s;s depends on the principle, that water can di&s;&s;olve only a certain quantity of &s;alt, and that the magne&s;ia may be wa&s;hed away by &s;uch a &s;uper&s;aturated &s;olution, while the &s;alt to which it adheres remains in&s;oluble. Salt thus purified will doubtle&s;s be more whole&s;ome, and more effectual for all the pur|po&s;es of &s;alting and pickling provi&s;ions; as the magne&s;ia contain|ed in the common &s;alt renders double, perhaps triple the quanti|ty nece&s;&s;ary, which would be required, were it in a pure &s;tate, or deprived of the magne&s;ia.</NOTE>&mdash;Hence
<PB N="136" REF="039111_0459_1013A276214ADF78">
&s;alt beef and herrings agree &s;o well with veg|etables, becau&s;e the abundance of &s;alt in the former, &s;ea&s;ons the latter. But too copious a u&s;e of &s;alted provi&s;ions is extremely prejudi|cial; they weaken the &s;olids, and the blood becomes thin, acrid, and di&s;po&s;ed to putre&s;|cency; hence ari&s;e &s;curvy in all its &s;tages, eruptions of the &s;kin, con&s;umptions, and other di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Sugar</HI> is at pre&s;ent one of the fir&s;t nece&s;|&s;aries of life. It is an unfounded conjecture, that &s;ugar renders the blood thick or vi&s;cid; on the contrary, it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of diluent and attenuating properties. But the immoderate u&s;e of &s;ugar, e&s;pecially the moi&s;t and coar&s;e &s;ort, may in a con&s;iderable degree prevent di|ge&s;tion, by con&s;uming the oleaginous part of our fluids, impeding the a&s;&s;imilation of food, and generating mucus and acidity in the ali|mentary canal.</P>
<P>It has frequently been a&s;&s;erted, that &s;ugar injures the teeth: this, however, is not &s;trictly
<PB N="137" REF="039111_0460_1013A2B8A594F8C0">
true; for it is only by its vitiating the &s;tomach, and generating impure blood, that the teeth become &s;ympathetically affected. Hence per|&s;ons of weak dige&s;tion, tho&s;e with debilitated nerves, the hypochondriac, hy&s;teric women, and e&s;pecially children &s;ubject to complaints ari&s;ing from worms, ought to u&s;e this luxuri|ous &s;ub&s;tance &s;paringly, and only occa&s;ionally. If moderately u&s;ed, it promotes dige&s;tion, being a gently &s;olvent and &s;timulating &s;alt. But, where people take it without moderation, &s;u|gar may prevent dige&s;tion, not on account of its &s;ub&s;tance, but by ob&s;tructing the a&s;&s;imila|tion of food, &s;o that it produces &s;limy and acid matters in the alimentary canal. The acid which &s;ugar contains, renders it an excellent remedy again&s;t putre&s;cence. The fine&s;t &s;ort of &s;ugar being freed of all impurities, is the be&s;t and mo&s;t whole&s;ome. Yet, in &s;ore throats and other catarrhal affections, I would prefer &s;ugar-candy or moderately fine loaf-&s;ugar, to that which is double refined, on ac|count of &s;ome particles of lime and clay, ne|ce&s;&s;arily remaining in the latter, from the manner in which it is prepared.&mdash;Other &s;weet &s;ub&s;tances, &s;uch as honey, cannot altogether &s;upply the place of &s;ugar, as they are not po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;ame properties; but there have been already made &s;ome very &s;ucce&s;sful exper|iments with the American maple-tree, (<HI>Acer &s;accharinus</HI>) which afford great hopes that we may obtain this valuable and indi&s;pen&s;able &s;alt, in future times, from that quarter of the globe, in &s;ufficient quantities, and at a rea&s;on|able price, when the mo&s;t flagitious of all

<P N="3">3. <HI>Honey,</HI> like &s;ugar, contains an acid, but many more inflammable particles; it ea&s;ily ferments, and therefore occa&s;ions flatulency. In &s;ome particular habits it is apt to occa&s;ion gripes and loo&s;ene&s;s: as a medicine, it is u&s;e|ful to the a&s;thmatic, to promote the expecto|ration of tough phlegm; and &s;o far it is an u&s;eful detergent and aperient. But, as a part of diet, when immoderately u&s;ed, it is hurtful to weak &s;tomachs, and ought to be avoided by people who are troubled with a &s;uperabun|dance of bile, and who&s;e humours incline to putrefaction.</P>
<P N="4">4. The different &s;pecies of <HI>Pepper,</HI> being &s;trongly heating and &s;timulating, &s;hould be u&s;ed with precaution.

Pepper ought, for the&s;e purpo|&s;es, to be coar&s;ely ground. If taken in whole grains, it imparts to the &s;tomach only a &s;mall part of its virtues, and cannot be reduced in dige&s;tion. In this form it is an old and ef|fectual dome&s;tic remedy of the Germans, a|gain&s;t vi&s;cidity in the &s;tomach, flatulency, weak dige&s;tion, and con&s;equent giddine&s;s.

<P N="5">5. <HI>Cubebs, Cardamoms, Vanilla</HI> and <HI>Cloves,</HI> are hot, pungent, and con&s;equently improper for daily u&s;e.&mdash;<HI>Cubebs</HI> are much inferior in pungency to pepper.&mdash;<HI>Cardamoms</HI> are a warm and grateful aromatic; they do not, like tho&s;e of the pepper kind, immoderately heat and inflame the bowels; hence they certainly de|&s;erve the preference for common u&s;e.&mdash;<HI>Vanil|la</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vanilla is the pod of the <HI>Epidendron,</HI> L. growing in Cayenne and &s;ome parts of Spani&s;h America.

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of EVACUATIONS;&mdash;their different &s;pecies, as well as their peculiar nature inve&s;tigated; to|gether with the nece&s;&s;ary directions for their management, according to the different &s;tates of the body.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<P>THE evacuations of the body, from its &s;u|perfluous, impure, and noxious parti|cles, are no le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary than its nouri&s;hment. The &s;ame power which changes and a&s;&s;imilates our food and drink, likewi&s;e effects the due and timely evacuation of what is &s;ecreted. It is an object of the fir&s;t con&s;equence, that nothing remain in the body, which ought to be evacuated; and that nothing be ejected, which may be of u&s;e to its pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>How many per&s;ons do we find complaining of bad health, notwith&s;tanding every attention they pay to the air they breathe, to aliment, exerci&s;e, &s;leep, &amp;c.; while others enjoy a good &s;tate of health, though totally carele&s;s with regard to the&s;e particulars. Indeed, much depends on a proper &s;tate of the evacu|ations.&mdash;If the&s;e be di&s;ordered, the mo&s;t rigor|ous ob&s;ervance of dietetic rules is in&s;ufficient to in&s;ure our health; while, on the contrary, mo&s;t of tho&s;e rules may be neglected, for &s;ome time, without any injurious con&s;equen|ces, if the evacuations be duly attended to.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="039111_0473_1013A28833399DF0">
Nature removes not only the noxious mat|ter, or &s;uch as is in a &s;tate of corruption, but likewi&s;e the u&s;eful fluids, if they become &s;u|perabundant; for in&s;tance, the milk, the &s;emen, the blood. In &s;uch ca&s;es, therefore, the&s;e mu&s;t be con&s;idered as objects of evacua|tion, equally natural and &s;alutary.</P>
<P>By <HI>&s;tool,</HI> the thick and feculent remains of a&s;&s;imilated food are evacuated; for every ar|ticle of aliment contains more or le&s;s dregs, and their &s;malle&s;t particles only can be changed into the milky fluid, or chyle.</P>
<P>By <HI>urine,</HI> we eject the oily and &s;aline parti|cles &s;ecreted from the blood, in a diluted &s;tate; which prevents the&s;e particles from injuring the external membranes, by their irritating acrimony.</P>
<P>By <HI>in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration,</HI> which is carried on through the &s;malle&s;t orifices of the pores, the mo&s;t &s;ubtile and noxious particles of the fluids are evaporated; which, if they were retained within the body, would lay the foun|dation of its total corruption.</P>
<P>Nature expels all crude and acrid &s;ub&s;tances by the&s;e three principal emunctories; and ac|cordingly as they are di&s;ordered, di&s;ea&s;es of different degrees of malignity and duration will nece&s;&s;arily en&s;ue.&mdash;Nature al&s;o frequently relieves her&s;elf by more unu&s;ual channels; &s;uch are, the bleeding of the no&s;e in plethoric young men, the hemorrhoids with which per|&s;ons of a middle age are &s;ometimes troubled, the various ulcers common to tho&s;e who&s;e fluids are in an impure &s;tate, the excretions of &s;aliva, and the expectorations of others, &amp;c.

By a premature &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the&s;e trouble|&s;ome but &s;alutary efforts of nature, great mi&s;|chief may be produced to the individual.</P>
<P>Many per&s;ons per&s;pire much under the arm|pits, others in their hands or feet; others again are &s;ubject to eruptions in the face or other parts of the body; &s;uch canals, howev|er, if Nature be once accu&s;tomed to eject by them certain u&s;ele&s;s and hurtful particles, can|not be ha&s;tily &s;topped, without occa&s;ioning greater and more dangerous inconveniences; cleanline&s;s, in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e of the word, is almo&s;t the only &s;afe remedy to counteract their fatal effects.</P>

<DIV3 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of Evacuations by Stool.</HEAD>
<P>As the food and drink we con&s;ume every day, nece&s;&s;arily depo&s;its u&s;ele&s;s matter, a daily opening by &s;tool is extremely &s;alutary; par|ticularly to per&s;ons &s;ubject to co&s;tivene&s;s and the many di&s;agreeable con&s;equences thence ari&s;ing. Of the&s;e I &s;hall only enumerate fre|quent head-achs, difficult breathing, flatu|lency, eructations, and &s;pa&s;ms: hence peev|i&s;hne&s;s of temper, general lethargy, and at length, hypochondria&s;is;&mdash;the abdomen of &s;uch per&s;ons feels tumid; the circulation of the blood in the inte&s;tinal ve&s;&s;els is retarded; and, con&s;equently, the general circulation in|terrupted. The&s;e complaints, &s;ooner or later, certainly attend habitual co&s;tivene&s;s; e&s;pecial|ly if no other kind of evacuation, as that by urine, or in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration, be in an uncommon degree increa&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="152" REF="039111_0475_1013A28AF667A490">
In healthy individuals, the evacuation by &s;tool u&s;ually takes place once or twice a-day; and, according to the habits of the per&s;on, either in the morning or evening. Tho&s;e who are troubled with co&s;tivene&s;s &s;hould vi&s;it the cu&s;tomary retreat, regularly every morn|ing at a fixed hour, and thus endeavour to pro|mote this nece&s;&s;ary evacuation by proper ef|forts, though they may not, at the moment, feel much inclination; for it is well founded on experience, that Nature at length will be habituated, by per&s;everance, to ob&s;erve a cer|tain regularity in this re&s;pect. The mo&s;t proper time for the&s;e attempts is early in the morning, or late in the evening.</P>
<P>Whatever dietetic means may be adopted to promote &s;tool ought to be employed either from three to four hours previous to the time we wi&s;h to &s;ucceed, or immediately before go|ing to bed. If in the morning, we ought to ri&s;e early, to take fir&s;t a &s;lice of bread with much fre&s;h butter; then eat &s;ome boiled prunes; drink two or three cups of the decoc|tion; and, if nece&s;&s;ary, a&s;&s;i&s;t the operation of the whole with a tea-&s;poonful or two of cream of tartar in treacle. Thus prepared, we ought to walk a little in the open air, or, if the weather be unfavourable, about the room; to rub the lower belly with the palm of the hand; and, when we &s;it down, to re|tain the breath, by frequently, though mod|erately, in&s;piring; and, la&s;tly, to change the po&s;ture of the body, from a &s;traight to a crooked and &s;idelong direction, till we &s;uc|ceed in the attempt.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="039111_0476_1013A2CBE970CF78">
Although the&s;e trials &s;hould repeatedly fail, we mu&s;t not be di&s;couraged from per&s;evering in them; nor ought we, without ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, to choo&s;e any other than the wonted hour to attain the end propo&s;ed; &s;o that this, at length, may become the only time, when Nature &s;hall &s;pontaneou&s;ly a&s;&s;i&s;t our endeav|ours. During the&s;e practices, however, the choice of our diet is of the greate&s;t moment; as we can powerfully promote the de&s;ired end, by living chiefly upon rye-bread, &s;pinage, boil|ed fruit, particularly prunes, decoctions of currants, the &s;weet and emollient vegetables, e&s;pecially the beet-root, and occa&s;ionally &s;alted meat; the la&s;t of which &s;hould be a&s;&s;i&s;ted with much drink, not of the &s;pirituous kind, but rather of a mild and aperient nature, &s;uch as &s;weet table-beer, whey, infu&s;ions of malt, ap|ples, pears, and the like.</P>
<P>It de&s;erves to be remarked, that if every effort of this kind prove abortive, the volun|tary exertions in promoting &s;tool &s;hould not be carried to an extravagant degree; as by &s;uch unnatural pre&s;&s;ure we may bring on rup|tures, the bur&s;ting of veins in the rectum, or the piles. Hence it is more advi&s;eable to ab|&s;tain, for &s;ome time, from all crude and &s;olid aliment, and to u&s;e only &s;uch articles of food and drink as have been before pointed out. And if this al&s;o &s;hould not be attended with the de&s;ired effect, we may then have recour&s;e to the mild purgatives, &s;uch as rhubarb, &s;enna, cream of tartar, and the neutral &s;alts.</P>
<P>While too much re&s;t, and a &s;edentary life, prevent this &s;pecies of daily evacuation, gentle
<PB N="154" REF="039111_0477_1013A28DCB1F3AA0">
exerci&s;e, accompanied with &s;erenity of mind, almo&s;t certainly promote it. In many fami|lies, co&s;tivene&s;s is an habitual and hereditary di&s;temper. Sometimes too it originates from a weakne&s;s of the inte&s;tinal canal brought on by di&s;ea&s;es, but more frequently from the hab|itual u&s;e of certain &s;ub&s;tances of food and drink; for in&s;tance, the lean fle&s;h of quadrupeds, game, the leguminous vegetables, red Port wine, &s;trong and bitter malt liquor, and the like. Hence the pre-di&s;po&s;ing cau&s;e of the complaint &s;hould always be attended to. If it ari&s;e from weakne&s;s, red wine, bitter ale, and other cor|roborants, are well calculated to effect a cure. In every in&s;tance, frequent exerci&s;e in the open air is extremely u&s;eful. Per&s;ons living &s;paringly on animal food, and who are other|wi&s;e temperate in their pa&s;&s;ions and de&s;ires, are &s;eldom deprived of this natural benefit; and even though they &s;hould be without it for two or three days together, they have little to apprehend from &s;uch irregularity; for, as they do not wantonly overload their &s;tomach, the accumulation of impurities cannot be con|&s;iderable.</P>
<P>Where weakne&s;s and atony, or laxity of the inte&s;tines, are the cau&s;es of a co&s;tive habit, the external u&s;e of cold water, by affu&s;ion on the lower belly or merely wa&s;hing it with that fluid, is frequently preferable to all other dietetic remedies. This is one of the mo&s;t &s;imple means of preventing painful co&s;tivene&s;s; though it ought not to be applied indi&s;crimi|nately, and lea&s;t of all in tho&s;e ca&s;es where
<PB N="155" REF="039111_0478_1013A2D13A202C38">
the u&s;e of the cold bath is improper and hurt|ful.&mdash;If debility and relaxation of the inte&s;tin|al canal be the cau&s;e of co&s;tivene&s;s, cly&s;ters of cold water alone are generally productive of &s;ingular benefit; yet the&s;e al&s;o cannot be u&s;ed without many exceptions&mdash;not, for in&s;tance, by females, during the men&s;es, by per&s;ons af|flicted with the piles, or having weak lungs, nor in certain kinds of colics and &s;pa&s;ms.</P>
<P>The di&s;charges by &s;tool ought to be neither in too liquid nor too dry a &s;tate. Strong labour, heating drinks, and long fa&s;ting, ren|der them di&s;agreeably hard, even in the health|ie&s;t individuals; from the feces remaining too long in the region of the lacteals, &s;o that the nutritious or milky part of the concocted ma&s;s is exhau&s;ted to the la&s;t drop, and there re|mains behind no other but dry, excrementi|tious matter. The&s;e &s;tools, therefore, are frequently a &s;ymptom of good dige&s;tion, &s;uch as attends &s;ound con&s;titutions in general.</P>
<P>Too dry excrements, in the form of balls, e&s;pecially in delicate individuals, occa&s;ion head-ach, inflammation of the eyes, febrile complaints, hemorrhoids, ruptures, paralytic affections, and frequently produce flatulency and &s;pa&s;ms, in per&s;ons &s;ubject to hy&s;terics and hypochondria&s;is: nay, even the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of flatulency is extremely dangerous. Tho&s;e who are apt to delay going to &s;tool, expo&s;e them|&s;elves to many &s;erious inconveniences. When this &s;en&s;ation is lo&s;t, it does not u&s;ually return for &s;ome time. The feces collected in the inte&s;tinal canal powerfully di&s;tend it, give ri&s;e to the blind hemorrhoids, and &s;ometimes even
<PB N="156" REF="039111_0479_1013A291738CF5E0">
to a falling down of the anus; the excrements become dry, and their re-ab&s;orbed fluid parts irritate and vitiate the blood, and produce many ob&s;tinate di&s;tempers. If a per&s;on has been co&s;tive for &s;everal days, the inclination to go to &s;tool is &s;ometimes lo&s;t, until re&s;tored by artificial means.</P>
<P>Loo&s;e and too frequent &s;tools are common with tho&s;e, who take more aliment than their &s;tomach can dige&s;t; for the food, from the &s;timulus occa&s;ioned by its corruption in the alimentary canal, is too &s;oon ejected, without being duly a&s;&s;imilated. Hence debilitated per|&s;ons, who eat immoderately, generally are thinner and le&s;s mu&s;cular than others, who ob&s;erve a regular and temperate diet. The &s;tools are a tolerable criterion of the quantity and quality of the food we have taken, and whether the dige&s;tive powers be adequate to its concoction. For, in weak inte&s;tines, the una&s;&s;imilated matter of food turns acrid, and contributes nothing to the nouri&s;hment of the body. Thus it happens, that debilitated indi|viduals, and &s;uch as are of a phlegmatic hab|it, continue lean and emaciated, whatever quantity of food they con&s;ume. For this rea|&s;on, they ought to live principally on milk, eggs, broths, tender meat, emollient vegetables; and to eat only when they feel a true appetite, and after moderate exerci&s;e.&mdash;It is not the man who takes comparatively little food, that can be called temperate; but rather that per|&s;on who makes u&s;e of no more aliment, than he is able to dige&s;t. Thin and copious &s;tools, therefore, are a certain proof of indige&s;tion.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="039111_0480_1013A2D2C41739D8">
Some per&s;ons are accu&s;tomed to go to &s;tool more than once a-day, others only every &s;econd day, and yet enjoy a good &s;tate of health. It is, however, more de&s;irable and whole&s;ome to have a regular evacuation every day; and children e&s;pecially ought to have two or three di&s;charges daily. Aged per&s;ons, in general, have but one &s;tool in a day. The air we breathe, makes, in this re&s;pect, a re|markable difference. The more we per&s;pire in &s;ummer, the fewer are the evacuations; and, on the contrary, moderate exerci&s;e is pro|ductive of more regular excretions, than that which is too violent. Robu&s;t and mu&s;cular individuals per&s;pire more than the weak and enervated; hence the evacuations of the for|mer, by other emunctories, are more limited; while the latter, who&s;e fluids are not duly de|termined to the &s;urface of the body, have more frequent openings by &s;tool.</P>
<P>Ob&s;tructions and co&s;tivene&s;s, of which ma|ny per&s;ons now complain, are owing to a vari|ety of cau&s;es, but chiefly to our luxurious mode of living, and to the cu&s;tom of making too many meals through the day. The time requi&s;ite to the dige&s;tion of a meal cannot be well a&s;certained, as &s;ome &s;tomachs concoct quickly, and others &s;lowly; and there is a re|markable difference in the degrees of dige&s;ti|bility, among the various &s;pecies of food; the nature and properties of which have been already pointed out in the fifth Chapter. But this may &s;erve as a general rule, that we ought never to take a new &s;upply of food, till the preceding meal be dige&s;ted.</P>

Some moderate livers, after having deviated from their u&s;ual temperance, do not feel any inconvenience till after two or three days, when they are troubled with copious evacua|tions, head-ach, unea&s;ine&s;s and dejection of mind. Such exce&s;&s;es are frequently accom|panied with &s;erious con&s;equences, of which co&s;tivene&s;s is only the forerunner. Neither the emetics, or laxatives, to which the glutton has recour&s;e, nor the fa&s;hionable &s;timulants and &s;trengthening bitters, can prevent or rem|edy the ultimate effects of &s;uch brutal habits. The emetics and purgatives inevitably weaken the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages, and lay the foundation of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">n&s;tant ob&s;tipations; while the &s;timulants deprive the inte&s;tines &s;till more of the nece&s;|&s;ary humours, and render the evil much great|er. The mo&s;t proper means of preventing the&s;e hurtful con&s;equences, are the following:</P>
<P N="1">1. A due degree of bodily exerci&s;e, by which the mu&s;cular power will be invigorated, the nervous &s;y&s;tem &s;trengthened, and the cir|culation of the blood promoted.</P>
<P N="2">2. We ought to take a proportionate quan|tity of drink to our victuals; a circum&s;tance not always &s;ufficiently attended to, by per&s;ons of a &s;edentary life. Drink dilutes the food, and &s;oftens the bowels. A weak, well-fer|mented, and well hopped beer, is an excellent beverage: &s;o is water with the addition of a little wine. Warm diluents, on the contrary, have a manife&s;t tendency to increa&s;e ob&s;truc|tions, by the relaxation they produce in the inte&s;tines.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="159" REF="039111_0482_1013A2D55850B758">
3. Let us choo&s;e the quality of our food, according to our con&s;titutional wants. Tho&s;e who cannot dige&s;t well, ought to avoid all thick, mealy di&s;hes, pa&s;try, onions, warm and new bread, and &s;uch as is not thoroughly bak|ed. Co&s;tive per&s;ons frequently complain of an acid generated in their &s;tomach; while others, on account of this acid, are &s;ubject to loo&s;e and very frequent &s;tools. Vinegar and tart wines are but rarely the cau&s;e of this acidity; never, indeed, except when they di&s;agree with the &s;tomach. New wines on the contrary, as well as vegetables of an ace&s;cent kind, and particularly long kept and roa&s;ted fat meat, have the &s;tronge&s;t ten|dency to produce acidity, the heart-burn, and, at length, ob&s;tructions in &s;ome con&s;titutions, and diarrhoeas in others. The proper &s;pecies of food, in &s;uch ca&s;es, are herbs, carrots, &s;u|gar-peas, french-beans, par&s;ley-roots, the &s;cor|cenera, artichokes, hor&s;e-radi&s;h, mu&s;tard-leaves, and &s;imilar plants, boiled &s;oft in broth, &s;ufficiently &s;alted, and without the addition of &s;at, or butter. Be&s;ides the&s;e, only a &s;mall quantity of meat ought to be u&s;ed, and this &s;hould be tender; but no fat fi&s;h, nor game kept too long, for the purpo&s;e of rendering it mellow; and la&s;tly, all kinds of fruit ought to be eaten boiled rather than raw.</P>
<P N="4">4. We &s;hould not too much indulge in &s;leep, which, particularly after dinner, is hurtful to per&s;ons who&s;e dige&s;tion is languid, and who&s;e evacuations are preternaturally &s;low. During &s;leep, all the motions in the &s;y&s;tem are per|formed with le&s;s vigour, and more tardily:
<PB N="160" REF="039111_0483_1013A319C2C14AB0">
and, in this re&s;pect, to keep awake may be con&s;idered as a &s;pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">es of exerci&s;e; as the nerves, in that &s;tate, are more active, and the circulation of the blood is carried on with greater energy.&mdash;Evacuations by &s;tool can be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, by &s;leeping an improper length of time, for in&s;tance, ten or twelve hours in&s;tead of &s;even or eight; and we may prevent the&s;e &s;alutary di&s;charges, by &s;itting down to any inactive employment, previous to the u&s;ual in|clination to retire to &s;tool.</P>
<P>If it be our wi&s;h to pre&s;erve health, we ought not only to guard again&s;t co&s;tivene&s;s, but likewi&s;e to prevent, by all proper means, to frequent excretions. Copious evacuations of this kind ex&s;iccate the body, and deprive it of that &s;trength, which is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;up|port its exertions. Per&s;ons &s;ubject to diar|rhoea, cannot be too cautious in the u&s;e of watery, &s;aline, and ea&s;ily fermentable articles of food and drink, and in avoiding violent fits of anger and other pa&s;&s;ions. On the contrary, they will promote their health, by u&s;ing pro|vi&s;ions of a drying nature, drinking a well-fermented, bitter beer or ale, or, if they can afford it, good old wine:&mdash;all of which have the beneficial tendency to promote per&s;pira|tion, and thus prevent &s;uperfluous humidity in the body.</P>
<P>If too copious evacuations proceed from a relaxed &s;tate of the inte&s;tines, daily exerci&s;e is of con&s;iderable efficacy; for the fibres of the whole body are thereby invigorated; and, if irritating or peccant humours &s;hould be the cau&s;e of the complaint, nothing is better cal|culated

<P>It would be a de&s;irable object, in hou&s;es which are not provided with water-clo&s;ets, that every individual were furni&s;hed with his own night-chair; as mo&s;t of the common places of retirement are literally ventilators, where &s;ome parts of the body are expo&s;ed to a cur|rent of air, which is frequently the cau&s;e of di&s;orders, particularly in per&s;ons &s;ubject to colds, and all other complaints originating from &s;uppre&s;&s;ed per&s;piration; accidents, which may injure &s;till more tho&s;e, who&s;e lungs are un&s;ound.

<HEAD>Of Urine.</HEAD>
<P>IN a &s;tate of health, this di&s;charge takes place oftener than once in a day. The urine of tho&s;e who live moderately, and take proper exerci&s;e, if examined in the morning after ri&s;ing, and after having &s;pent a quiet and com|fortable night, is thin, clear, of a &s;traw colour or inclining to yellow, with a white, loo&s;e, and uniform &s;ediment ri&s;ing in the middle; it makes no foam, but what immediately van|i&s;hes, and has no unu&s;ually di&s;agreeable &s;mell. If it corre&s;pond to this de&s;cription, it is a &s;ymp|tom of good dige&s;tion, and of the body being free from impurities. The quantity of this evacuation, in healthy per&s;ons, depends on their con&s;titution, the &s;ea&s;on and the weather. It is le&s;s in warm than in cold climates, on account of the increa&s;ed per&s;piration. In win|ter,
<PB N="163" REF="039111_0486_1013A2DAB2132338">
we generally eject more urine than in &s;um|mer; and this nearly in proportion to the de|gree of in&s;en&s;ible exudation. In &s;pring and autumn, it is probably voided in an equal proportion.</P>
<P>We may judge (not progno&s;ticate) re&s;pect|ing the &s;tate of the body, from the appearance of the urine in the morning only; for, during the day, this would be a fallacious criterion, from the nature and quantity of food and drink we con&s;ume. The ancients were ex|tremely fond of predicting the different &s;tates of health and di&s;ea&s;e in the human body, from the appearances ob&s;erved in the urine. Among the moderns, who are better acquainted with the animal economy, the&s;e appearances are not implicitly attended to, as they have fre|quently been found to mi&s;lead the ob&s;erver; yet, the early morning urine, if allowed to &s;tand for an hour or two, exhibits &s;ome phe|nomena, which render it an object worthy the attention of the medical practitioner. Thus, a thin, pale urine, which is voided by the hy|pochondriac, the hy&s;teric, and per&s;ons afflict|ed with &s;pa&s;ms in the abdomen, indicates great weakne&s;s, or the approach of cramps, originating from a contraction of the &s;maller &s;ecretory organs. It is likewi&s;e of a whiti&s;h colour, after taking much weak drink. In debilitated individuals, the urine is foamy, and this froth remains on the top for a con&s;i|derable time; becau&s;e it abounds in tough and vi&s;cid particles. The health of &s;uch per&s;ons, however promi&s;ing in appearance, is by no means permanently e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="039111_0487_1013A31DE48AD008">
The urine is of a red colour, after too little drink, or after drinking &s;pirituous liquors, af|ter violent exerci&s;e, profu&s;e per&s;piration, and after having &s;pent a re&s;tle&s;s night. It yields a &s;ediment re&s;embling brick-du&s;t, when the &s;tomach is impure, and the tongue white with a yellowi&s;h taint, and covered with vi&s;cous matter. According to the higher or paler colour of the urine, in an ordinary &s;tate of health, the body may be con&s;idered as being more or le&s;s vigorous. If, after long &s;tanding, no &s;ediment be depo&s;ited in it, great weakne&s;s is indicated: yet the conclu&s;ion is more favour|able, although the urine be thick and &s;andy, if a cloud be ob&s;erved &s;wimming in the middle.</P>
<P>Indeed it is le&s;s dangerous to &s;uppre&s;s the evacuations by &s;tool, than tho&s;e by urine; for, if this remain too long in the bladder, it be|comes acrid and corro&s;ive. If the inclination to make water is accompanied with a di&s;charge of a few drops only, it is called a <HI>&s;trangury;</HI> if the difficulty of voiding it is attended with pain, a <HI>dy&s;uria;</HI> and, if a total &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of it takes place, it is then called an <HI>i&s;churia.</HI> The&s;e di&s;ea&s;es are frequently the effects of &s;ome malt-liquors, or of certain articles of food, particularly vegetables containing much acidity. In the beginning of &s;uch painful complaints, relief can be given by fomenting the patient, about the genitals, with flannel|cloths, as hot as he can bear them, by keep|ing him &s;ufficiently warm, and allowing him plenty of warm, diluent drink.</P>
<P>Although the quantity of the urine to be voided through the day cannot be accurately
<PB N="163" REF="039111_0488_1013A2DD521BAA78">
a&s;certained, yet this evacuation ought always to be proportionate to the drink we have taken, and to the greater or le&s;s degree of per&s;piration. If we perceive a deficiency in this di&s;charge, we ought to take moderate ex|erci&s;e, to drink light, thin, and acidulated diluents, and to eat a variety of &s;uch herbs and fruits, as po&s;&s;e&s;s diuretic virtues: of this nature are, par&s;ley, a&s;paragus, celery, juni|perberries, &s;trawberries, cherries, and the like. We &s;hould be careful, not to retain the urine too long; a practice which would occa&s;ion relaxation and pal&s;y of the bladder, and which might at length produce the gravel or &s;tone.</P>
<P>Many maladies may ari&s;e from voiding too &s;mall a quantity of urine; hence the nece&s;&s;ity of attending to this excretion, from which we may frequently di&s;cover the cau&s;e of the di&s;|ea&s;e. The relative &s;tate of vigour or debility in the individual, the mode of life, more or le&s;s drink, dry or damp weather&mdash;all produce a difference in the quantity of this evacuation. Robu&s;t per&s;ons eject le&s;s urine than the debili|tated: a copious emi&s;&s;ion of it is always a &s;ymptom of a relaxed body, which is not po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ufficient energy to expel its noxious particles by tran&s;piration through the cuta|neous ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>The more exerci&s;e we take, the le&s;s we lo&s;e by the urinary pa&s;&s;age; &s;ince they are drain|ed by the pores. Cold and moi&s;t air checks per&s;piration, but promotes the excretion by urine. When this canal is &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, the bladder &s;ometimes becomes &s;o much di&s;tended that it bur&s;ts, as may ea&s;ily happen to parturi|ent

women; and hence ari&s;e incurable <HI>fi&s;tulae;</HI> or, if the pa&s;&s;ages be ob&s;tructed, the urine re|treats into the cellular texture of the whole body, and penetrates even into the cranium. Women, however, are able to retain it longer than men.&mdash;Too copious an evacuation of urine con&s;titutes a peculiar di&s;ea&s;e, known by the name of <HI>diabetes,</HI> which not unfrequent|ly proves fatal to the &s;ufferer, after he has di&s;|charged &s;everal gallons a day, for a con&s;ider|able length of time.</P>
<P>Among the rules and cautions for the prop|er management of this evacuation, it de&s;erves to be remarked, that it is hurtful to make wa|ter too often, or before a proper quantity of it be accumulated in the bladder. By &s;uch practice, this ve&s;&s;el gradually contracts into a narrower compa&s;s than is a&s;&s;igned by nature, and cannot again be ea&s;ily di&s;tended. Too long a retention of urine, on the contrary, preternaturally enlarges the bladder, weakens its mu&s;cular power, and may, with the ad|vancement of age, occa&s;ion <HI>i&s;churia</HI> or a total &s;uppre&s;&s;ion; be&s;ides which it promotes the depo&s;ition of mucus and &s;and in the bladder, and inevitably leads to that trouble&s;ome and painful complaint, the &s;tone.</P>

body from &s;o many impurities, particularly from acrid and thin humours, as in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration. The health of man chiefly de|pends on the proper &s;tate of this function: the irregularities occurring in it, occa&s;ionally produce peevi&s;hne&s;s of temper, head-ach, di&s;|turbed &s;leep, heavine&s;s in the limbs, &amp;c.; and, on the contrary, we find our&s;elves mo&s;t lively and vigorous, when it is duly and uniformly performed.</P>
<P>A per&s;on of a middle &s;tature, and in perfect health, per&s;pires, according to the calculation of &s;ome, from three to four pounds weight, according to others, about five pounds, within twenty-four hours. The exudation by the pores is mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential during the night; the noxious particles only being then &s;eparated; which, on account of the di&s;turbances we are expo&s;ed to through the day, cannot be &s;o well effected, as the circulation of the blood is thereby interrupted, while at night it is com|paratively more calm and regular;&mdash;be&s;ides which, the nocturnal per&s;piration is more co|pious, from the greater uniformity of the &s;ur|rounding atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the febrile di&s;ea&s;es ari&s;e from a &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed per&s;piration; as the exuded matter is of an acrid and irritating nature. To tran&s;pire beneficially, means, that the impure and per|nicious particles only be ejected, in which ca&s;e the per&s;piration is invi&s;ible and imperceptible. This is &s;o e&s;&s;ential a requi&s;ite, that without it the health of the individual cannot long &s;ub&s;i&s;t. The reciprocal connection between the func|tions of the &s;tomach, and of per&s;piration, is
<PB N="168" REF="039111_0491_1013A3244F81C1D0">
&s;o obvious, that if the latter be checked, the former is immediately affected; and the re|ver&s;e takes place, if the &s;tomach be di&s;ordered.</P>
<P>The more vigorou&s;ly a per&s;on per&s;pires, (it ought to be well remarked, that the que&s;tion here is not of <HI>&s;weating</HI>) the more active are the powers of the body, in the regular con|coction of the alimentary juices; and the more certain it is, that no fluids will &s;uperabound: for the fluids though refined and &s;ubtile, far exceed in weight the more compact and &s;olid parts of the &s;y&s;tem, &s;o that they would oppre&s;s the machine like a heavy burden, if not evac|uated by the pores of the &s;kin. Mo&s;t individ|uals; however, are accu&s;tomed to direct their attention only to evacuations of a more gro&s;s nature, or &s;uch as are more obvious to the &s;en&s;es. But <HI>in&s;en&s;ible</HI> per&s;piration is of greater moment than all the other excretions; and by paying due regard to that function, if it &s;hould be accidentally di&s;turbed, we may frequently di&s;cover the lurking cau&s;e of a di&s;temper, and remove it, before it has materially injured the body.</P>
<P>Yet, even in the mo&s;t healthy, this per&s;pira|tion is not at all times, nor at all hours of the day, equally active. It is weaker after a plen|tiful meal, but as &s;oon is the food is dige&s;ted, we again per&s;pire with increa&s;ed energy; for the new chyle being changed into blood, im|parts additional efficacy to the vital powers, as well as to the circulation of the blood it&s;elf. As we per&s;pire con&s;iderably more in &s;ummer than in winter, our mode of life, with re&s;pect to &s;leep, as well as to food and drink, ought to be regulated
<PB N="169" REF="039111_0492_1013A2E3D435B0D8">
accordingly. We know from accurate ob&s;er|vation, that if we retire to bed immediately after &s;upper, the proce&s;s of per&s;piration is checked in a remarkable degree: we al&s;o know, that it is highly conducive to health, that this important function of the body be pre&s;erved in the mo&s;t uniform &s;tate; hence it nece&s;&s;arily follows, that, after &s;upper, we ought to &s;it up at lea&s;t two hours; and to afford this benefit both to the organs of dige&s;tion and per&s;piration, our &s;uppers &s;hould not be delay|ed to the late hours now &s;o ab&s;urdly in fa&s;hion.</P>

<P N="2">2. By ob&s;tructions of the cutaneous ve&s;&s;els, which are frequently occa&s;ioned by the u&s;e of &s;alves, ointments, and co&s;metics.</P>

<P N="1">1.

<P N="2">2. By the lukewarm bath, which is well calculated to &s;often the &s;kin, and thus to open the pores for a better per&s;piration.</P>
<P N="3">3. By moderate bodily exerci&s;e.</P>
<P N="4">4. By mild &s;udorific remedies;&mdash;and for this rea&s;on it is extremely proper, in ca&s;e of a recent cold, to drink two or three cups of tea, e&s;pecially previous to going to bed.</P>

By means of this exudation, both noxious and u&s;eful particles are at the &s;ame time ejected from the &s;urface; the body is enfeebled; the blood is

<P>If &s;weating be carried to exce&s;s, it is ex|tremely noxious, and may even be productive of con&s;umption.

<P>Cold then only checks per&s;piration, when it occa&s;ions an unu&s;ual &s;timulus on the &s;kin, and if we too &s;uddenly remove from a warm to a cold atmo&s;phere. Hence the nece&s;&s;ity of ac|cu&s;toming our&s;elves, from early youth, to the vici&s;&s;itudes of heat and cold, of walking ev|ery day in the open air, and of wa&s;hing the whole body, at lea&s;t once a week, with luke|warm, or &s;till better, with cold water. By this practice the pores are braced, and inured to undergo the different changes of the weather and &s;ea&s;ons, without &s;uffering (as mo&s;t people now do, upon the &s;lighte&s;t occa&s;ion) by &s;evere cold and catarrhs.</P>
<P>It is never too late to begin this &s;trengthen|ing proce&s;s, by frequently wa&s;hing and rub|bing the whole &s;urface of the body with cold water; for, if cautiou&s;ly managed at fir&s;t, it cannot fail to invigorate young per&s;ons and adults, as well as the aged.&mdash;To &s;leep on feath|er-beds occa&s;ions a con&s;tant vapour-bath at

night, which again de&s;troys the beneficial ac|qui&s;itions of the day.&mdash;To remove from a cold temperature to a &s;till colder one, is not nearly &s;o prejudicial, as to exchange &s;uddenly the air of a warm room, for that of a moi&s;t and cold atmo&s;phere. This accounts for the frequent colds caught in &s;ummer, even by going from the burning rays of the &s;un to the cooling &s;hade; and hence too the fir&s;t cold of autumn is mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly felt, becau&s;e we are then un|accu&s;tomed to that impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Much al&s;o, as has been before ob&s;erved, de|pends on the nature and properties of our food and drink, in re&s;pect to the &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration. The &s;ubtile and rarefied fluids only, not tho&s;e of a coar&s;e and oily con&s;i&s;tence, can pervade the &s;kin. Too many oleaginous, vi&s;cous, and crude articles of nouri&s;hment, &s;uch as fat meat, pa&s;try, boiled mealy di&s;hes, &s;moked hams, &s;au&s;ages, &amp;c. have a &s;trong ten|dency to ob&s;truct the free per&s;piration of the body, and con&s;equently to affect the &s;erenity of the mind.</P>
<P>All the depre&s;&s;ing pa&s;&s;ions and emotions are a powerful check to in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration; while, on the contrary, tho&s;e of an exhilarating nature may promote and increa&s;e it to &s;uch a degree, as &s;ometimes to prove the pre-di&s;po&s;|ing, though di&s;tant cau&s;e of con&s;umptions. Moderate daily exerci&s;e is eminently calculat|ed to &s;upport this function, and to &s;trengthen the whole body. Cleanline&s;s produces a &s;im|ilar effect; for &s;ome impurities continually &s;et|tle on the &s;urface of the body; and the&s;e, if not removed in time, clog the pores, and are

&s;o detrimental to health, that they may occa|&s;ion many ob&s;tinate di&s;tempers, which might be ea&s;ily prevented, or at lea&s;t checked in their progre&s;s, by a proper and con&s;tant attention to the &s;kin.</P>
<P>Too violent a per&s;piration indicates great debility of the body, or a laxity of the cutane|ous ve&s;&s;els, which may frequently be removed by cold bathing or wa&s;hing. When per&s;ons are troubled with unu&s;ual night-&s;weats, they may receive benefit (if it be not a &s;ymptom of hectic fever) by taking, immediately before go|ing to bed, two or three drachms of cream of tartar, in either beer or water. But if this &s;imple remedy, after repeated trials, &s;hould prove ineffectual, a profe&s;&s;ional man ought to be con&s;ulted; as long-continued night-&s;weats may in the end produce great weakne&s;s, and even con&s;umption.</P>
<P>In mo&s;t of the common colds, the popular &s;timulant remedies, &s;uch as heating liquors, and particularly &s;udorifics, are ill calculated to relieve the complaint. If the patient, at the &s;ame time, be troubled with pain in the bowels, head-ach, a foul tongue, &amp;c. a gentle laxative will be of greater &s;ervice than the diaphoretics. But if the &s;tomach be peculiarly affected, if the tongue be clean and the appetite good; two or three cups of warm diluent drink, a tepid bath of the legs, a moderately warm room and dre&s;s, gentle exerci&s;e, and friction of the &s;kin with warm cloths, are the mo&s;t proper and generally effectual means of relief.</P>
<P>As the retention of u&s;ele&s;s and &s;uperfluous matter is hurtful, it is not le&s;s detrimental to

<P>The inclination to this intercour&s;e, and the evacuation connected with it, are no le&s;s in|herent in nature, than other bodily functions. Yet, as the &s;emen is the mo&s;t &s;ubtile and &s;pir|ituous part of the human frame, and as it &s;erves to the &s;upport of the nerves, this evacuation is by no means ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; and it is be&s;ides attended with circum&s;tances not com|mon to any other. The emi&s;&s;ion of &s;emen en|feebles the body more than the lo&s;s of twenty times the &s;ame quantity of blood, more than violent cathartics, emetics, &amp;c.: hence ex|ce&s;&s;es of this nature produce a debilitating ef|fect on the whole nervous &s;y&s;tem, on both body and mind.</P>
<P>It is founded on the ob&s;ervations of the able&s;t phy&s;iologi&s;ts, that the greate&s;t part of this re|fined fluid is re-ab&s;orbed, and mixed with the blood, of which it con&s;titutes the mo&s;t rarefied

and volatile part; and that it imparts to the body peculiar &s;prightline&s;s, vivacity, and vi|gour. The&s;e beneficial effects cannot be ex|pected, if the &s;emen be wantonly and improv|idently wa&s;ted. Be&s;ides, the emi&s;&s;ion of it is accompanied with a peculiar &s;pecies of ten|&s;ion and convul&s;ion of the whole frame, which is always &s;ucceeded by relaxation. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, even libidinous thoughts, with|out any lo&s;s of &s;emen, are debilitating, though in a le&s;s degree, by occa&s;ioning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> of the blood to the genitals.</P>

It is well e&s;tabli&s;hed, and atte&s;ted by the ex|perience of eminent phy&s;icians, that in certain indi&s;po&s;itions, both of men and women, this is the only permanent remedy that can be ad|vi&s;ed, to re&s;tore their langui&s;hing health.

In the vernal months; as Nature, at this &s;ea&s;on in particular, incites all the lower animals to &s;exual intercour&s;e; as we are then mo&s;t vigorous and &s;prightly; and as the &s;pring is not only the &s;afe&s;t, but likewi&s;e the be&s;t time, with re&s;pect to the con&s;equences re&s;ult|ing from that intercour&s;e.

<P>It may be collected from the following cir|cum&s;tances, whether or not the gratification of the &s;exual impul&s;e has been conducive to the well-being of the body; namely, if it be not &s;ucceeded by a peculiar la&s;&s;itude; if the body do not feel heavy, and the mind aver&s;e to re|flection: all which are favourable &s;ymptoms, indicating that the various powers have &s;u&s;tain|ed no e&s;&s;ential lo&s;s, and that &s;uperfluous mat|ter only has been evacuated.</P>

<P>There are, however, many ca&s;es in which this gratification is the more detrimental to health, when it has been immoderate, and with|out the impul&s;e of Nature, but particularly in the following &s;ituations:</P>

1. In all debilitated per&s;ons; as they do not po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ufficient vital &s;pirits; and their vigour, after this enervating emi&s;&s;ion, is con&s;equently much exhau&s;ted. Their dige&s;tion nece&s;&s;arily &s;uffers, per&s;piration is checked, and the body becomes languid and heavy.</P>
<P N="2">2. In the aged, who&s;e vital heat is dimini&s;h|ed, who&s;e frame is enfeebled by the mo&s;t mod|erate enjoyment, and who&s;e &s;trength, already reduced, &s;uffers a &s;till greater diminution, from every lo&s;s, that is accompanied with a violent convul&s;ion of the whole body.</P>
<P N="3">3. In per&s;ons not arrived at the age of ma|turity:&mdash;by an early intercour&s;e with the other &s;ex, they become enervated and emaciated, and inevitably &s;horten their lives.</P>

<P N="7">7. In the heat of &s;ummer, it is le&s;s to be in|dulged in than in &s;pring and autumn; becau&s;e the proce&s;s of concoction and a&s;&s;imilation is effected le&s;s vigorou&s;ly in &s;ummer than in the other &s;ea&s;ons, and con&s;equently the lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;|tained are not &s;o ea&s;ily recovered. For a &s;im|ilar rea&s;on, the &s;exual commerce is more de|bilitating, and the capacity for it &s;ooner ex|tingui&s;hed, in hot than in temperate climates. The &s;ame remark is applicable to every warm temperature combined with moi&s;ture, which is extremely apt to debilitate the &s;olid parts. Hence hatters, dyers, bakers, brewers, and all tho&s;e expo&s;ed to &s;team, generally have relaxed fibres.</P>
<P N="8">8. In a po&s;ture of body, which requires great mu&s;cular exertion, it is comparatively more enfeebling; as, in this ca&s;e, various powers are exhau&s;ted at once.</P>

could be repaired by &s;leep: but if, at the &s;ame time, it be productive of relaxation, &s;o as to affect the in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration, it is a &s;till &s;tronger proof that it has been detrimental to the con&s;titution.&mdash;There are, as has been be|fore ob&s;erved, two principal cau&s;es, from which the indulgence in this pa&s;&s;ion has a de|bilitating effect on the con&s;titution, particu|larly in men:&mdash;1. by the convul&s;ive motion of the whole frame, combined with the im|pa&s;&s;ioned ec&s;tacy of the mind; and, 2. by the lo&s;s of this e&s;&s;ential fluid, more than by any other circum&s;tance. But, if it be not emitted, the &s;ub&s;equent relaxation is incon&s;iderable, and not much increa&s;ed even on the following day, if the &s;emen &s;hould be ejected, upon a repetition of the intercour&s;e.&mdash;It certainly is ill-founded, that &s;wellings of the &s;crotum may ari&s;e from a &s;tagnation of the &s;eminal fluid: &s;uch &s;wellings, if they really take place, are not attended with any danger; as experience informs us, that they are either again ab&s;orbed, to the benefit of the body, or if the accumu|lation of the &s;emen become too copious, it is &s;pontaneou&s;ly evacuated by Nature.</P>
<P>The relaxation of tho&s;e who keep within the bounds of moderation, in this re&s;pect, does not continue long; one hour's &s;leep is generally &s;ufficient to re&s;tore their energy. Such temperance is highly beneficial to the whole body, while it &s;erves to animate all its powers, and to promote in&s;en&s;ible per&s;pira|tion, as well as the circulation of the blood. The &s;emen can be emitted without injuring the body, is Nature alone demand it, that is,
<PB N="189" REF="039111_0512_1013A2FCAE449EA8">
when the re&s;ervoirs are full, and a material &s;timulus occa&s;ions it, without the active con|currence of imagination.</P>
<P>As it is principally this fluid which affords vivacity, mu&s;cular &s;trength, and energy to the animal machine, the frequent lo&s;s of it cannot but weaken the nerves, the &s;tomach, the in|te&s;tines, the eyes, the heart, the brain&mdash;in &s;hort, the whole body, together with the men|tal faculties; it in a manner de&s;troys the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|dour for every thing great and beautiful, and &s;urrenders the voluptuary, in the prime of his life, to all the terrors and infirmities of a pre|mature old age, from which even the conju|gal &s;tate cannot &s;ave him. The mo&s;t certain con&s;equence of exce&s;s in venery is hypochon|dria&s;is, frequently accompanied with incurable melancholy: the unhappy victim endeavours to exhilarate him&s;elf by a repetition of the&s;e convul&s;ive exertions of his vital &s;pirits, and thus precipitates him&s;elf into &s;till greater mi&s;|ery.&mdash;Many of the di&s;ea&s;es of the eyes origin|ate from &s;uch intemperance; and the&s;e votaries of plea&s;ure are not unfrequently attacked with <HI>tabes dor&s;alis,</HI> or con&s;umption of the back, which generally proves fatal.</P>
<P>Here likewi&s;e, every individual ought to pay proper regard to his con&s;titution. Some are provided by Nature with an uncommon portion of bodily vigour, while others are but &s;paringly &s;upplied: the former, therefore, overcome &s;light tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of this kind, without much danger, while the latter cannot commit exce&s;&s;es with impunity. The natural in&s;tinct ought always to be con&s;ulted, in what|ever
<PB N="190" REF="039111_0513_1013A34061E379E0">
relates to this function; but it &s;hould not, as is frequently the ca&s;e, be confounded with the artificial &s;timulus. Hypochondriacs, indeed, as well as tho&s;e who make u&s;e of ma|ny nouri&s;hing &s;pecies of food and drink, are &s;ometimes &s;timulated merely by a certain ac|rimony in the abdominal ve&s;&s;els; &s;uch a &s;timulus, however, is totally unconnected with the impul&s;e of Nature.</P>
<P>Frequent and copious emi&s;&s;ions, during &s;leep, are productive of equally bad effects; they bring on the frailties of age at an early period of life, and &s;oon prepare the exhau&s;ted &s;ufferer for the grave. But infinitely more dangerous is the &s;ecret vice of Onani&s;m, which debilitates the body more than any other &s;pe|cies of debauchery. By this execrable practice, a greater quantity of &s;emen is evacuated, than by the natural commerce between the &s;exes; the vital &s;pirits cannot operate &s;o uniformly, as to counterbalance the convul&s;ive effects which agitate the whole animal frame; and the circum&s;tances, which render this hateful vice &s;o de&s;tructive to both &s;exes, particularly at a tender age, are, that the opportunities of committing it are more frequent than tho&s;e of the &s;exual intercour&s;e, and that it but too of|ten becomes habitual.</P>
<P>The imagination which, by the natural u|nion of the &s;exes, is in a certain degree gratifi|ed, becomes with every repetition of Onani&s;m more di&s;ordered, and is continually filled with libidinous images: and although the frequent lo&s;s of &s;emen, is, for a con&s;iderable time, &s;up|plied, by a fluid of an inferior quality, yet,
<PB N="191" REF="039111_0514_1013A2FE50575598">
even by this imperfect &s;upply, the body is drained of the &s;pirituous and mo&s;t valuable parts of its fluids.</P>
<P>All kinds of evacuation, when immoderate, are prejudicial to health; but that of the &s;e|men is particularly &s;o; for it is an e&s;tabli&s;hed fact, that every &s;timulus increa&s;es the &s;ecretion of humours, and that Nature is nece&s;&s;arily forced to make irregular efforts, to re&s;tore the lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained, in the mo&s;t &s;peedy, though in its con&s;equences, the mo&s;t ruinous manner.</P>
<P>As mo&s;t female animals refu&s;e to receive the males, while they are in a &s;tate of preg|nancy, the connection with pregnant women appears to be phy&s;ically improper. Although the dangerous con&s;equences thence ari&s;ing, both to the mother and child, may have been exaggerated, yet the embrace of women far advanced in pregnancy is certainly not con|formable to the laws of Nature, and ought not to be con&s;idered as a matter of indiffer|ence. Such females as wantonly &s;ubmit to it may readily mi&s;carry; for the fetus is thus much compre&s;&s;ed, and an additional flow of humours is thereby occa&s;ioned. If, however, in married life, this intercour&s;e, notwith&s;tand|ing its impropriety, &s;hould be indulged in, it ought to be practi&s;ed with precaution, and not too frequently; as &s;uch exce&s;&s;es may not only enfeeble the mother, but likewi&s;e be attended with effects very hurtful to the child. Nay, it is a&s;&s;erted by &s;ome authors, that the frequent ca&s;es of <HI>hydrocephalus,</HI> or drop&s;y in the head, are to be a&s;cribed chiefly to this practice

<P>A connection with females &s;uckling chil|dren, is not le&s;s improper; as the milk is thereby vitiated, and the health of the infant affected.&mdash;Nor is it ju&s;tifiable to gratify this pa&s;&s;ion during the men&s;es; which may be ei|ther thus &s;uddenly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, or, by the in|crea&s;ed acce&s;s of the fluids, may terminate in an hemorrhage of the womb: be&s;ides which, the &s;exual intercour&s;e during this period, as well as for &s;ome days immediately preceding, cannot an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of generation; becau&s;e the ovum of the female, being but &s;lightly attached, is again &s;eparated by the periodical di&s;charge. Hence the congre&s;s of the &s;exes is mo&s;t generally crowned with fer|tility, after the catemenia have cea&s;ed; for then the female is in the mo&s;t proper &s;tate for fecundation, becau&s;e that the ovum has &s;uf|ficient time to be con&s;olidated, before the next men&s;trual evacuation.</P>

It is of a greyi&s;h colour, inclining to white, is glutinous and tough;

In water, the thicker part, which in all probability is the pure &s;emen, &s;inks to the bottom; another part appears in fine threads, and forms a thin pellicle on the &s;urface of the water. In per|&s;ons not arrived at the age of maturity, and likewi&s;e in enervated adults, it is of a thin and &s;erous con&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>In the fre&s;h &s;emen of tho&s;e who are capable of procreating, we find a great number of an|imalculae, which can be perceived only by means of the mo&s;t powerful micro&s;copes: the&s;e do not appear to be mere ve&s;icles filled with air; as they are formed irregularly, one extremity being &s;omewhat &s;pherical, the other &s;maller and rather pointed; their &s;uppo&s;ed u&s;e will be mentioned towards the conclu&s;ion of this chapter, when treating on the different theories of generation.</P>

<P>No irregularities whatever are more certain|ly puni&s;hed than tho&s;e of venery; and, though the con&s;equences &s;hould not immediately take place, they unavoidably follow, and generally at a time when they are mo&s;t &s;everely felt; &s;ometimes in the organs of generation alone, and &s;ometimes over the whole body.

Thus Nature becomes in a manner forced to conduct the fluids to the parts of generation, &s;o that &s;uch unfortunate per&s;ons cannot relinqui&s;h this de|&s;tructive habit; they are troubled with invol|untary emi&s;&s;ions of the &s;emen, which are ex|tremely debilitating, and which either deprive them entirely of the faculty of procreating, or de&s;troy the ela&s;ticity of the parts, and exhau&s;t the &s;emen to &s;uch a degree, as to produce only feeble and enervated children.</P>

<P>It is further remarkable, that mo&s;t per&s;ons, e&s;pecially in the higher ranks, do not marry at a proper period of life; partly from caprice and family-con&s;iderations; partly on account of the difficulty to maintain a family, in the pre&s;ent more expen&s;ive mode of living; and partly from other cau&s;es which are be&s;t known to bachelors.

<P>"The origin of the fir&s;t germ of the em|bryo, (&s;ays the learned Profe&s;&s;or) and the manner of its formation, are &s;o ob&s;cure, that of all the conjectures made by the mo&s;t atten|tive and ingenious ob&s;ervers, none has yet obtained general credit, or arrived at any de|gree of certainty. The &s;exual function ap|pears to belong to tho&s;e &s;ecrets of Nature, to the developement of which the powers of the human under&s;tanding are altogether inade|quate.

<P>"Some of the ancient naturali&s;ts have &s;earched for the fir&s;t germ of the embryo, not within the bodies of the parents, but ab&s;olute|ly in external objects; while they maintained, that it is introduced from without, either by the air, or particular articles of nouri&s;hment; and, if it happen to meet with a body qualifi|ed to effect its formation, it then receives life, and grows; but, in the contrary ca&s;e, it pa&s;&s;|es away unchanged.

<P>"By another hypothe&s;is (<HI>generatio aequivo|ca</HI>) it was a&s;&s;erted, that a variety of in&s;ects, and even of the &s;maller animals, may originate
<PB N="205" REF="039111_0528_1013A311A3B51148">
from extraneous &s;ub&s;tances, by mere fermen|tation and putrefaction, without previous generation, or any intercour&s;e of males and females.&mdash;Thus maggots were &s;aid to ari&s;e from putrifying meat, and in wounds; fleas to grow in urine and feces, &amp;c. But by more accurate ob&s;ervations we have learnt, that &s;uch vermin are only generated in putre&s;cible bodies, when the eggs of tho&s;e in&s;ects, which feed upon putrid &s;ub&s;tances, have been previ|ou&s;ly depo&s;ited in them.&mdash;Yet there is a cer|tain kind of minute animals, which &s;eem to receive life merely from the vivifying powers of Nature, being bred, by infu&s;ion, in &s;ub&s;tan|ces foreign to their &s;pecies; and to the&s;e per|haps the preceding theory is &s;o far applicable, as their origin is involved in ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>"Other naturali&s;ts have a&s;cribed the fir&s;t germ of the embryo exclu&s;ively to the &s;emen of the male.

The &s;ame phenomenon was al&s;o ob&s;erved in the mature &s;emen of other male animals; and in the&s;e animalculae were immediately thought to be &s;een the germs of &s;ub&s;equent perfect animals.

<P>"Another &s;ect of natural philo&s;ophers, who attributed to both &s;exes an equal &s;hare in the procreating function, maintained, that the germ of the embryo originates in a mixture of the male and female &s;emen, the latter of which proceeds from the ovaria. Among later nat|urali&s;ts, the celebrated BUFFON was the prin|cipal &s;upporter of this opinion. He endeavour|ed to e&s;tabli&s;h this hypothetical notion, by conjoining with it the idea of certain <HI>internal forms,</HI> which were requi&s;ite to the formation of the parts of the body; in con&s;equence of which he maintained, that the &s;ex of the em|bryo
<PB N="207" REF="039111_0530_1013A3132996E960">
is determined by the circum&s;tance of its con&s;i&s;ting of a greater quantity of male or fe|male &s;emen.&mdash;But, as the &s;uppo&s;ed female &s;e|men does not proceed from the ovaria, and as the ovaria are not connected with the womb by any tubes, but merely by &s;olid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, it follows that women &s;ecern no &s;emen, and what is improperly &s;o called, is only, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> I have already ob&s;erved, a pituitous liquor &s;ecreted from the uterus and the vagina.

Be&s;ides, the fanciful internal forms of Buffon cannot be proved by any argument or ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>"Again, others have a&s;cribed the germ of the embryo to the mother alone, while they granted to the male &s;emen no other power than that of vivification. The&s;e philo&s;ophers, among whom we find HALLER and BONNET, &s;eriou&s;ly a&s;&s;erted, that the whole body of the embryo lies already prepared in the ovary of the mother, &s;o that it requires only to be de|veloped, and that the male &s;emen communi|cates merely the fir&s;t impul&s;e to this develope|ment. They certainly went too far in this a&s;|&s;ertion; yet it is highly probable, that the crude matter already exi&s;ts in the ovary, and that it is fir&s;t animated by the &s;emen of the male, and thus qualified for its gradual for|mation.</P>

"Re&s;pecting the manner in which the em|bryo is formed, there prevail two principal theories, namely, that of <HI>evolution,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>"According to this theory, (&s;ays the facetious <HI>Prof.</HI> BLU|MENBACH, <HI>of G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ttingen,</HI>) we, and indeed all the children of Adam, were at one time, <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> pent up in the two ovaria of our com|mon mother, Eve.

<P>"The &s;ame kind of idea has lately induced a very celebrated naturali&s;t of Geneva, and a warm advocate of this theory, to plan out for us a hi&s;tory of organized bodies previous to the &s;tate of impregnation; from which we learn, 1. that we are all much older than we &s;uppo&s;e our&s;elves to be: 2. that all mankind are exactly of the &s;ame age, the great-grandfather being not a &s;econd older than the younge&s;t of his great-grandchildren; 3. that this re&s;|pectable age of ours may be about &s;ix thou&s;and years.

In this manner, our apartment became gradually more ea&s;y and commodious, in proportion as our fore|fathers were evolved; and we kept continually expanding our|&s;elves more and more, until the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of evolution at la&s;t came to our turn!!"</P>
<P>Such is the ludicrous account of a theory which, though lead|ing to the mo&s;t extravagant and romantic conclu&s;ions, was &s;up|ported by the great Baron HALLER, and the late Italian philo&s;o|pher, SPALLANZANI.

<P>"Baron von Haller immediately declared loudly again&s;t this objection, and denied it, as a thing altogether <HI>impo&s;&s;ible,</HI> that the tender ve&s;&s;els of the micro&s;copic embryo &s;hould be capable of ana&s;tomo&s;ing with the large blood-ve&s;&s;els of the giant yolk.</P>
<P>"But what is rather &s;ingular is, that this very ingenious and meritorious author, who denies the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch an ana&s;to|mo&s;is, &s;uppo&s;es without any he&s;itation, and in the &s;ame work, when explaining human conception, that the very minute germ, as &s;oon as it has arrived at the cavity of the uterus, forms an adhe&s;ion with it, by means of the placenta;&mdash;And how?&mdash;Ju&s;t in the &s;ame way that he denies it to the embryo of the hen; that is to &s;ay, by an ana&s;tomo&s;is taking place between the micro&s;copic and ten|der branches of the umbilical ve&s;&s;els, and the giant ones of the maternal uterus.</P>

<P>"Nearly a century indeed before that period, SWAMMERDAM announced the wonderful di&s;covery, that the black points in the &s;pawn of a frog were &s;o many perfectly-formed little frogs, and that they pre-exi&s;ted in the ovaria, although not di&s;coverable by the naked eye.</P>
<P>"The good man &s;eemed to have had a <HI>pre&s;entiment</HI> of the un|certainty and in&s;tability of all vain worldly honours; and he therefore, as is well known, &s;oon after betook him&s;elf to a more &s;olid enjoyment, in which Mademoi&s;elle Bourignon participated. And, indeed, it happened as he appears to have fore&s;een; for the ungrateful world now a&s;cribe the merits of that di&s;covery to the celebrated Abbe SPALLANZANI, who has maintained it in &s;ev|eral of his writings, but more particularly in the &s;econd volume of his "<HI>Di&s;&s;ertazioni di fi&s;ica animale e vegetabile.</HI>" Tom. xi. in Mo|dena, 1780, 8vo.</P>
<P>"He calls the little black points of the fecundated &s;pawn of frogs, tadpoles, or young frogs; and, as this little black point ex|actly re&s;embles the &s;ame in the unfecundated &s;pawn, he rea&s;ons agreeably to his logic, that the tadpoles mu&s;t have exi&s;ted in the mother.&mdash;I do not know what would be thought of a chemi&s;t who &s;hould a&s;&s;ert that the <HI>Arbor Dianoe</HI> pre-exi&s;ted in a ma&s;s of amal|gam of &s;ilver, becau&s;e, when a weak &s;olution of &s;ilver was poured on it, a little tree &s;eemed to &s;pring out of it.&mdash;One ought to be a&s;hamed of wa&s;ting much tune in the refutation of an a&s;&s;ertion, of the fal&s;ity of which any unprejudiced per&s;on, who is not alto|gether unaccu&s;tomed to ob&s;ervations of the kind, may convince him&s;elf, every &s;pring.</P>
<P>"Whoever has taken the trouble accurately to examine the &s;pawn of the frog, mu&s;t confe&s;s, that the idea of demon&s;trating the little black points it contains to be &s;o many completely form|ed tadpoles, re&s;embles Brother Peter's method of rea&s;oning in the <HI>Tale of a Tub,</HI> where he demon&s;trates to his brothers, that a brown loaf is a piece of excellent roa&s;t mutton.&mdash;But the abettors of the theory of organized germs have gone a &s;tep farther in &s;upport of their opinions. They refer to ca&s;es where even young girls, in all their maiden cha&s;tity, have become pregnant, from the untimely and premature evolution of one of the&s;e organized germs.</P>
<P>"The concurrence of facts is &s;ometimes mo&s;t wonderful. It happened, that in the very &s;ame year, in which Swammerdam an|nounced his di&s;covery in the &s;pawn of the frog, a ca&s;e was pub|li&s;hed in the <HI>Ephem. rerum nat. curios.</HI> delivered to the &s;ociety by a celebrated court-phy&s;ician of tho&s;e times. Dr. CLAUDIUS, which exactly &s;uited, as a confirmation of Swam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">dam's opinion.&mdash;A miller's wife was delivered of a little girl, who&s;e belly &s;eemed of an unu&s;ual &s;ize. Eight days afterwards this big-bellied child was &s;eized with &s;uch violent pains and re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, that every one who was pre&s;ent thought it could not outlive the next in&s;tant. The &s;ick infant, however, in the mean time, actually bore a well-form|ed, elegant, lively little daughter, about the &s;ize of one's middle finger, which was regularly baptized. During the time, and af|ter the birth, the waters, placenta, and other impurities were duly di&s;charged; but both the little mother and daughter died early on the following day!!!" (Prof. Blumenbach &s;ays, in a note &s;ub|joined to this account, that he has made u&s;e of the very words of a contemporary phy&s;ician, Dr. OTTO, who was con&s;ulted by the grandmother (the miller's wife) during her pregnancy. His nephew has vindicated and illu&s;trated the whole hi&s;tory in a mo&s;t learned and ingenious manner: <HI>'D. C. J. Aug.

<P>"Baron von Haller very judiciou&s;ly cla&s;&s;es this ca&s;e with an|other from the Tran&s;actions of the Academy of Sciences at Stockholm, where, on di&s;&s;ecting a young girl, bones, teeth, and hairs, were found in a tumour of the me&s;entery.

which, however, is a direct demon&s;tration of the contrary. The objections which have been &s;tarted again&s;t this opinion, concerning the

Be&s;ides the&s;e con&s;iderations, many arguments may be produced to &s;hew the futility of that doctrine.</P>
<P>"More probable than the former, unque&s;|tionably is the theory of <HI>gradual formation:</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Another definition of <HI>Epigene&s;is</HI> de&s;erves to be in&s;erted here, as it is more conci&s;e, and as its author, Prof. Blumenbach, has not only embraced this doctrine as the mo&s;t rational on a &s;ubject of &s;o my&s;terious a nature, but has likewi&s;e been at great pains to elucidate the gradual formation of animate bodies by an addition|al hypothe&s;is&mdash;his <HI>ni&s;us formativus (Bildungs-trieb),</HI> or the &s;ponta|neous effort of Nature in forming homogeneous &s;ub&s;tances.&mdash;"It is &s;uppo&s;ed," &s;ays he, "that the prepared, but at the &s;ame time unorganized rudiments of the foetus, fir&s;t begin to be gradually organized, when it arrives at its place of de&s;tination, at a due time, and under the nece&s;&s;ary circum&s;tances. This is the doc|trine of Epigere&s;is." And with a view to corroborate this &s;up|po&s;ition, the learned Profe&s;&s;or makes the following categorical declaration: "<HI>That there is no &s;uch thing in nature, as pre-exi&s;ting or|ganized germs; but that the unorganized matter of generation, after be|ing duly prepared, and having arrived at its place of de&s;tination, acquires a peculiar action, or ni&s;us, which ni&s;us continues to operate through the whole life of the animal, and that by it the fir&s;t form of the animal, or plant, is not only determined, but afterwards pre&s;erved, and when de|ranged, is again re&s;tored. A ni&s;us, which &s;eems therefore to depend on the powers of life, but which is as di&s;tinct from the other qualities of liv|ing bodies, (&s;en&s;ibility, irritability, and contractility,) as from the common properties of dead matter: that it is the chief principle of generation, growth, nutrition, and reproduction; and that to di&s;tingui&s;h it from all others, it may be denominated the</HI> FORMATIVE NISUS."</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add, that this is, at pre&s;ent, the prevailing theory in the German Univer&s;ities; though, in reality, it leaves us as much in the dark as any other.</P></NOTE> according to which it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that previ|ous to generation there exi&s;ts no real germ, but crude matter only, from which the parts of the organic body are gradually formed. The power by which this formation is accompli&s;h|ed, is a certain formative effort pervading all nature, (NISUS FORMATIVUS; <HI>vis pla&s;tica, vis e&s;&s;entialis</HI>) manife&s;ting its activity according to equal and determinate laws, although in a dif|ferent

manner, in the functions of nutrition and generation, as well as in the re&s;toration of parts accidentally lo&s;t. It may be &s;afely a&s;&s;erted, that this is a mere modification of the univer&s;al power of vitality; if no ob&s;tacle be oppo&s;ed to this pla&s;tic effort, the young organic body then receives its proper form; but, in the contrary ca&s;e, there ari&s;e various unnatural &s;hapes and mon&s;ters. By the influence of cli|mate, aliment, mode of living, and other in|cidental circum&s;tances, this effort of Nature may, in the cour&s;e of life, be variou&s;ly modi|fied; nay, it is liable to changes in the very fir&s;t crude matter, or in the pla&s;tic lymph, by the different con&s;titution of the male &s;emen.&mdash;But the principal arguments in favour of the theory of gradual formation are ju&s;tly derived from the fir&s;t origin of plants, from the for|mation of the chick in the egg, and from the reproduction of &s;uch parts of the body as have been lo&s;t, either by accident or nece&s;&s;ity.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the AFFECTIONS and PASSIONS of the MIND;&mdash;their relative good and bad effects on Health.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE boundle&s;s ocean does not exhibit &s;cenes more diver&s;ified, than the various affections and pa&s;&s;ions of the human mind. They ari&s;e partly from the mind it&s;elf, and partly from the various con&s;titutions and tem|peraments of the individual. While no other remedies but rational arguments can influence the mind, the di&s;po&s;ition of the body may be changed and improved, by an infinite variety of means.</P>
<P>It is, indeed, principally from bodily cau&s;es, that many per&s;ons are violently affected from the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant motives, and others are little, if at all, influenced by the mo&s;t calamit|ous events. It is, for in&s;tance, obviou&s;ly from a phy&s;ical cau&s;e, that violent medicines, poi|&s;ons, the bite of mad animals, &amp;c. produce timidity, or fits of anger and rage;&mdash;that ac|cumulations of black bile in the abdomen make people re&s;erved, peevi&s;h, melancholy, and &s;tupid. What we wi&s;h to think, and in what manner to continue the operations of the mind, frequently does not depend upon our|&s;elves. The thoughts of the &s;ober are very different from tho&s;e of the man in a &s;tate of
<PB N="215" REF="039111_0538_10136ED7057B5200">
intoxication. A certain di&s;h, a particular drink, may &s;u&s;pend the powers of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The temperament of man is, as it were, the &s;ource of his mental operations. Affections and pa&s;&s;ions are different one from another in degree only. The former imply the inclina|tion or propen&s;ity to a pa&s;&s;ion; the latter, the realized affections, whether &s;imple or com|pound; or in other words, they con&s;titute an actual and perceptible degree of &s;en&s;ual de&s;ire or aver&s;ion. According to Lord KAIMES, pa&s;&s;ions are active and accompanied with de|&s;ires; affections are inactive and de&s;titute of pa&s;&s;ion. He al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hes between wi&s;h|es and de&s;ires: the former he calls the high|e&s;t activity of the affections. Compa&s;&s;ion and wi&s;hes for the better, are in his idea <HI>affections:</HI> pity, and a de&s;ire after what is better, he calls <HI>pa&s;&s;ions.</HI></P>
<P>Pa&s;&s;ions operate upon the body either &s;ud|denly, or &s;lowly and gradually. Sudden death, or imminent danger of life, may be the con|&s;equence of the former: a gradual decline and con&s;umption, that of the latter. The pa&s;&s;ions, as &s;uch, may be aptly divided into two principal cla&s;&s;es, tho&s;e of an agreeable and of a di&s;agreeable nature. Men of &s;trong imagination chiefly &s;uffer from pa&s;&s;ions of the violent kind, while tho&s;e of more under&s;tanding, and le&s;s fancy, are &s;ubject to &s;low emotions of the mind. Indolent per&s;ons, who&s;e &s;en&s;ations are dull, and le&s;s pa&s;&s;ionate, than tho&s;e who combine acute feelings, and a lively imagina|tion, with a clear under&s;tanding. The great|e&s;t minds are generally the mo&s;t impa&s;&s;ioned</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="039111_0539_1013A35C2E602D58">
All pa&s;&s;ions, of whatever kind, if they ri&s;e to a high and violent degree, are of a danger|ous tendency; bodily di&s;ea&s;e, nay death it&s;elf, may be their concomitant effects. Fatal apo|plexies have frequently followed &s;udden dread or terror. Catalep&s;y and epileptic fits &s;ome|times accompany immoderate affliction, or di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing anxiety. Hypochondria&s;is, hy&s;terics, and habitual dejection, may indeed ari&s;e from a variety of phy&s;ical cau&s;es; but they are as frequently generated by the pa&s;&s;ions or &s;uffer|ings of the mind alone, in individuals other|wi&s;e healthy.</P>
<P>Di&s;ea&s;es of the mind, after &s;ome time, pro|duce various di&s;orders of the body; as di&s;ea&s;es of the body occa&s;ionally terminate in imbecil|ity. In either ca&s;e, the malady mu&s;t be op|po&s;ed by phy&s;ical, as well as moral remedies.</P>
<P>It is only by the management of the con&s;ti|tution and education of the individual, that the pa&s;&s;ions may be rendered u&s;eful; for, if un|controlled and left to them&s;elves, they affect us as a tempe&s;t does the ocean, without our being able to counteract their pernicious influ|ence. Since all affections whatever con&s;i&s;t in de&s;ire or aver&s;ion, they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be ac|companied with repre&s;entations of &s;o lively a nature, as to induce the individual to perform the corre&s;ponding voluntary motions. Con|&s;equently the affections mu&s;t al&s;o be accompa|nied by <HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> motions within the body, not only by voluntary actions, but by tho&s;e al&s;o, which contribute to the &s;upport of life, and which are more or le&s;s violent, according to the degree of the affection. Joy, for in&s;tance,
<PB N="217" REF="039111_0540_1013A35ED8569B28">
enlivens all the corporeal powers, and, as it were, pervades the whole animal frame. Hope has nearly a &s;imilar effect; and the&s;e two affections contribute to the pre&s;ervation of health and life, more than all the medicines that can be contrived. But of the other affec|tions of the mind, we can, in mo&s;t in&s;tances, ob&s;erve &s;carcely any other effect, than that of irregular motions, which, not unlike medi|cines, in a limited degree, and under certain circum&s;tances, may be occa&s;ionally u&s;eful. <HI>Hence the dominion over our pa&s;&s;ions and affec|tions is an e&s;&s;ential and indi&s;pen&s;able requi&s;ite to health.</HI> Every individual, indeed, is at his birth provided with a certain ba&s;is of inclina|tions, and with his peculiar moral tempera|ment: the mo&s;t tender infant, even before he is capable of &s;peaking, di&s;covers by his fea|tures and ge&s;tures the principal inclinations of his mind. If the&s;e be fo&s;tered in his &s;u&s;cepti|ble brea&s;t, they will grow up with him, and become &s;o habitual, that the adult cannot, without the greate&s;t exertion, overcome them by the power of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The phy&s;ical &s;tate of the body is mo&s;t hap|py, when the mind enjoys a moderate degree of gaiety, &s;uch as is generally met with in healthy and virtuous per&s;ons. The circula|tion of the fluids and per&s;piration are then car|ried on with proper vigour; ob&s;tructions are thereby prevented or removed; and by this lively and uniform motion, not only dige&s;tion, but likewi&s;e all the other functions of the body, are duly performed.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="039111_0541_1013A3606266BB70">
<HI>Joy</HI> is that &s;tate of the mind, in which it feels extraordinary plea&s;ure; in which it en|joys a high degree of contentment and happi|ne&s;s. The activity of the whole machine is enlivened by it; the eyes &s;parkle; the action of the heart and arteries is increa&s;ed; the cir|culation of all the fluids is more vigorous and uniform; it facilitates the cure of di&s;ea&s;es in general, and forwards convale&s;cence. The different degrees of this affection are, <HI>Gaiety, Cheerfulne&s;s, Mirth, Exultation, Rapture,</HI> and <HI>Ec&s;tacy.</HI>&mdash;Habitual joy and &s;erenity, ari&s;ing from the perfection, rectitude, and due &s;ubor|dination of our faculties, and their lively exer|ci&s;e on objects agreeable to them, con&s;titute mental or rational happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Evacuations which are moderate, a proper &s;tate of per&s;piration, and all food of an aperi|ent quality and ea&s;y dige&s;tion, may be con&s;id|ered as contributing to a joyful &s;tate of mind. A pure, dry air, and every thing that invigo|rates the functions of the body, on the well-be|ing of which the &s;erenity of mind greatly de|pends, has a tendency to obviate &s;tagnations. Joy farther is more &s;alutary, when combined with other moderate affections: and the vari|ous bodily exertions, as well as the employ|ments of the mind, in reflecting upon different objects, are then &s;ucce&s;sfully performed.&mdash;A moderate degree of joy removes the noxious particles of the body, and in this re&s;pect is equal, nay &s;uperior in &s;alubrity, to bodily ex|erci&s;e; but exce&s;s and too long duration of this pa&s;&s;ion attenuate and carry away not only the &s;uperfluous, but likewi&s;e many u&s;eful flu|ids,
<PB N="219" REF="039111_0542_1013A3655E729610">
and more than the natural functions can re|&s;tore. Hence, this too violent motion and di&s;|&s;ipation of humours is attended with relaxa|tion and heavine&s;s; and &s;leep al&s;o is prevent|ed, which alone can re-invigorate the nerves, that have &s;uffered from too great ten&s;ion. On this account, the celebrated SANCTORIUS di&s;|&s;uades per&s;ons from gambling, who cannot control their pa&s;&s;ions; becau&s;e of the joy which accompanies their &s;ucce&s;s, being follow|ed by re&s;tle&s;s nights, and great ab&s;traction of per&s;pirable matter. Sudden and exce&s;&s;ive joy may prove extremely hurtful, on account of the great wa&s;te of energy, and the lively vibra|tion of the nerves, which is the more noxious after long re&s;t. Nay, it may become dangerous, by cau&s;ing expan&s;ion or laceration of the ve&s;|&s;els, &s;pitting of blood, fevers, deprivation of under&s;tanding, &s;wooning, and even &s;udden death. If we have anticipated any joyful event, the body is gradually prepared to un|dergo the emotions connected with it.&mdash;For this rea&s;on, we ought to fortify our&s;elves with the nece&s;&s;ary &s;hare of firmne&s;s, to meet joyful as well as di&s;a&s;trous tidings.</P>
<P><HI>Laughter</HI> is &s;ometimes the effect or con&s;e|quence of joy; and it frequently ari&s;es from a &s;udden di&s;appointment of the mind, when directed to an object which, in&s;tead of being &s;erious and important, terminates unexpected|ly in in&s;ignificance. Within the bounds of moderation, laughter is a &s;alutary emotion; for, as a deep in&s;piration of air takes place, which is &s;ucceeded by a &s;hort and frequently repeated expiration, the lungs are filled with
<PB N="220" REF="039111_0543_1013A366E32DB108">
a great quantity of blood, and gradually emp|tied, &s;o that its circulation through the lungs is thus beneficially promoted. It manife&s;ts a &s;imilar effect on the organs of dige&s;tion. Pains in the &s;tomach, colics, and &s;everal complaints that could not be relieved by other means, have been frequently removed by this. In many ca&s;es, where it is purpo&s;ely rai&s;ed, laugh|ter is of excellent &s;ervice, as a remedy which agitates and enlivens the whole frame. Expe|rience al&s;o furni&s;hes us with many remarkable in&s;tances, that ob&s;tinate ulcers of the lungs and and the liver, which had re&s;i&s;ted every effort of medicine, were happily opened and cured by a fit of laughter artificially excited.</P>
<P><HI>Hope</HI> is the anticipation of joy, or the pre|&s;entiment of an expected good. It is attended with all the favourable effects of a fortunate event, without po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing any of its phy&s;ical di&s;advantages; becau&s;e the expectation of hap|pine&s;s does not affect us &s;o exce&s;&s;ively as its enjoyment. Be&s;ides, it is not liable to tho&s;e interruptions, from which no human plea&s;ure is exempt; it is employed principally with ideal or imaginary objects, and generally keeps within the bounds of moderation; la&s;tly, the &s;en&s;e of happine&s;s contained in hope far ex|ceeds the &s;atisfaction received from immediate enjoyment, con&s;equently it has a more benefi|cial influence on health than good fortune re|alized. Although hope is, in it&s;elf, merely ideal, and pre&s;ents its flattering and embelli&s;h|ed images to the fancy in a borrowed light, yet it is, neverthele&s;s, the only genuine &s;ource of human happine&s;s. Hope, therefore, is the
<PB N="221" REF="039111_0544_1013A36985DDD8A8">
mo&s;t favourable &s;tate of mind to health, and has frequently pre&s;erved the &s;erenity and pro|longed the exi&s;tence of tho&s;e, who&s;e &s;ituation appeared to be forlorn.</P>
<P><HI>Love,</HI> viewed in its mo&s;t favourable light, pre&s;ents to us a picture of permanent joy, and is attended with all the good effects of that pa&s;&s;ion. It enlivens the pul&s;ations of the heart and arteries, promotes the operations of the different functions of the body; and it has frequently been ob&s;erved, that a &s;trong at|tachment to a beloved object has cured in|veterate di&s;orders, which had re&s;i&s;ted all me|dicinal powers, and which had been con&s;ider|ed incurable. The changes which this pa&s;&s;ion can effect on the powers and the whole di&s;|po&s;ition of the mind, are equally remarkable. For the extraordinary exertions, made to ob|tain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the object of our wi&s;hes, ex|cite a &s;en&s;ation and con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;trength, which enables man not only to undertake, but al&s;o to perform the greate&s;t achievements. In that exalted &s;tate, he &s;ets all difficulties at defiance, and &s;urmounts every ob&s;tacle.</P>
<P><HI>Sorrow</HI> is the rever&s;e of joy, and operates either &s;uddenly or &s;lowly, according as the cau&s;e of it is of greater or le&s;s importance and duration. The lowe&s;t degree of it is called <HI>Concern;</HI>&mdash;when it ari&s;es from the di&s;appoint|ment of hopes and endeavours, it is <HI>Vexation;</HI>&mdash;when &s;ilent and thoughtful it &s;ettles into <HI>Pen&s;ivene&s;s</HI> or <HI>Sadne&s;s;</HI>&mdash;when it is long in|dulged in, &s;o as to prey upon, and po&s;&s;e&s;s the mind, it becomes habitual, and grows into
<PB N="222" REF="039111_0545_1013A36B0A4F2CE8">
<HI>Melancholy.</HI>&mdash;Sorrow increa&s;ed and continu|ed, is called <HI>Grief;</HI>&mdash;when to&s;&s;ed by hopes and fears, it is <HI>Di&s;traction;</HI>&mdash;when all the&s;e are drowned by &s;orrow, it &s;ettles into <HI>De&s;pair.</HI>&mdash;The highe&s;t degrees of &s;orrow are called <HI>Agonies.</HI></P>
<P>Sorrow &s;eldom proves &s;uddenly fatal; for, though it injures the nervous energy, it does not ha&s;ten the circulation of the blood, with the rapidity of other pa&s;&s;ions, but rather re|tards its cour&s;e. Yet there are examples of its &s;peedy and fatal effects.&mdash;Not unlike a &s;low poi&s;on, &s;orrow corrodes the powers of mind and body; it enfeebles the whole nervous &s;y&s;|tem; the heart beats &s;lower; the circulation of the blood and other fluids becomes more inert; they frequently &s;tagnate in their chan|nels, and generate evils more &s;erious than &s;ad|ne&s;s it&s;elf. Farther, the face at fir&s;t turns pale, then yellow and tumid; the body and mind are worn out; the cour&s;e of the blood through the lungs mu&s;t be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by frequent &s;ighing; the appetite and dige&s;tion become vitiated; and thus ari&s;e ob&s;tructions, hy&s;teric and hypochondriacal complaints, and, at length, con&s;umption, which is inevitable de|&s;truction to the body, frequently in the prime of life, and in &s;pite of the healing art. Per|&s;ons who indulge them&s;elves in peevi&s;hne&s;s, very &s;oon lo&s;e their appetite, together with the power of dige&s;tion; their mouth has a bitter ta&s;te; flatulency, colic, &s;pa&s;ms, faint|ings, and the long li&s;t of &s;tomachic complaints nece&s;&s;arily follow. Men become &s;ubject to the blind hemorrhoids; and women to &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion

or other irregularities of the men&s;es, co&s;tivene&s;s, or chronic diarrhoea. The bile, on account of the retarded circulation, either grows hard and produces indurations of the liver, or it is mixed with the blood, and gen|erates jaundice or drop&s;y. Such per&s;ons in time become very irritable and peevi&s;h; and with the frequent return of grief, the mind, at length, is totally employed in contemplat|ing its wretched &s;ituation, &s;o that it finds new food for increa&s;ing it in almo&s;t every object it beholds. Hence the whole imagination is by degrees ob&s;cured, and the mo&s;t u&s;ual con|&s;equences of it are, the deepe&s;t melancholy&mdash;&s;ucceeded either by a nervous fever, or in&s;ani|ty&mdash;&s;ometimes cancer, and at other times a &s;peedier di&s;&s;olution, by what is then called <HI>a broken heart.</HI></P>
<P>Solitude and idlene&s;s are not only the re|mote cau&s;es of many pa&s;&s;ions, but al&s;o &s;up|port and fo&s;ter them, without exception: they collect and fix the attention of the mind on the favourite objects, and make us reflect the more keenly on the cau&s;es of the pa&s;&s;ions, the le&s;s we are interrupted in the&s;e fond rev|eries by other &s;en&s;ations. Though it is cer|tain, that it is not in our power to avert grief, from which even &s;ages and heroes are not al|ways exempt, yet we can do much to allevi|ate it, by denying our&s;elves the enjoyment which this indulgence in certain &s;ituations af|fords. Moral arguments of con&s;olation, if properly adapted to the capacity and mental di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;ufferer, have in the&s;e ca&s;es generally a powerful influence. Tho&s;e who&s;e
<PB N="224" REF="039111_0547_1013A37166CAC940">
minds are affected by &s;orrow, ought to avoid as much as po&s;&s;ible the company of per&s;ons, who are fond of relating their calamities, and recounting their misfortunes. On the contra|ry, whatever has a tendency to cheer the mind, and to divert it from di&s;agreeable objects, ought to be in&s;tantly re&s;orted to. Of this na|ture are, company, bu&s;ine&s;s, cheerful mu&s;ic, and the &s;ocial affections.&mdash;The body &s;hould be frequently rubbed with dry cloths, perfumed with amber, vinegar, &s;ugar, and the like; the lukewarm bath may be employed with great advantage; and, if circum&s;tances permit, the patient &s;hould remove to a warmer and drier climate.&mdash;If temperately u&s;ed, a weak and mild wine is of excellent &s;ervice, but an immoder|ate indulgence in wine may di&s;order the &s;to|mach, by the quantity of acid it produces.</P>
<P><HI>Weeping</HI> generally accompanies &s;orrow, if it be not too inten&s;e: tears are the anodynes of grief, and ought not to be re&s;trained by adults. We feel in weeping an anxiety and contraction of the brea&s;t, which impedes re&s;piration; prob|ably, becau&s;e then a &s;uperfluous quantity of air is contained in the lungs, which is forcibly expelled by &s;obbing. By this ob&s;truction in breathing, the blood, which ought to be re|conducted from the head, accumulates in the lungs, and con&s;equently in the veins: hence ari&s;e redne&s;s, heat of the face, and a flow of tears, which are regulated in quantity by the degree of &s;adne&s;s that produced them. Their principal good effects are, their preventing the danger to be apprehended from grief, by di|mini&s;hing the &s;pa&s;modic motions in the brea&s;t
<PB N="225" REF="039111_0548_1013A37427302678">
and head, and by re&s;toring regularity in re&s;|piration, as well as in the circulation of the blood: hence per&s;ons find them&s;elves much relieved after a plentiful flow of tears, which however are extremely prejudicial to the eyes.</P>
<P>Grief ari&s;ing from an ungratified de&s;ire of returning home and &s;eeing our relations, is productive of a di&s;ea&s;e very common among the Swi&s;s, and which &s;ometimes, after a &s;hort &s;tate of melancholy, trembling of the limbs, and other &s;ymptoms apparently not very dan|gerous, hurries the unhappy &s;ufferer to the grave, but more frequently throws him into a con&s;umption, and generates the mo&s;t &s;ingular whims and fancies. Per&s;ua&s;ions, puni&s;hments, medicines, are here of no &s;ervice; but a &s;ud|denly revived hope, or gratification of the pa|tient's wi&s;hes, have a powerful effect; provi|ded that an incurable con&s;umption, or in&s;ani|ty, have not already taken place.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a &s;ingular hy&s;teric or nervous fever, which affects many unfortunate &s;ufferers in mental di&s;orders, and which was fir&s;t ac|curately de&s;cribed by RICHARD MANNING|HAM. Debilitated per&s;ons, and tho&s;e of great &s;en&s;ibility, of both &s;exes, after melancholy af|fections and other exhau&s;tions of &s;trength, are particularly &s;ubject to this di&s;order. It begins with irregular paroxy&s;ms, and manife&s;ts it&s;elf by an undefinable indi&s;po&s;ition, a dry tongue without thir&s;t, anxiety without a vi&s;ible cau&s;e, want of appetite, a low, quick, and unequal pul&s;e, a pale and copious urine, occa&s;ional &s;en|&s;ations of cold and &s;hivering, &s;ometimes clam|my &s;weats, &s;ometimes colic, &s;leeple&s;&s;ne&s;s, and
<PB N="226" REF="039111_0549_1013A376BB4C38B8">
in&s;anity. According to the experience of Manningham, this fever generally terminates, in the cour&s;e of thirty or forty days, by faint|ings, &s;ilent reveries, and death; unle&s;s it be removed in the beginning, by bracing and &s;trengthening remedies.</P>
<P>Among the mournful pa&s;&s;ions we may al&s;o include an <HI>extravagant degree of love,</HI> or &s;uch as tran&s;gre&s;&s;es the bounds of rea&s;on. It is then no longer a plea&s;ure, but a di&s;quietude of mind, attended with the mo&s;t irregular emo|tions; it di&s;orders the under&s;tanding; grad|ually con&s;umes all the vital powers, by a &s;low fever; prevents nutrition, and reduces the body to a &s;keleton. All the pa&s;&s;ions, indeed, may in their more violent degrees occa&s;ion a depravation of the under&s;tanding; but &s;orrow and love are peculiarly calculated to produce &s;o fatal an effect. This mental di&s;order, to which both &s;exes, but e&s;pecially women, are &s;ubject, &s;hould be oppo&s;ed in time, by phy&s;ical as well as moral remedies.&mdash;Much may be done here by education, and a proper choice of &s;ociety. The imagination &s;hould be with|drawn from &s;uch images, as may encourage inordinate and exce&s;&s;ive love; and it cannot be denied, that young females particularly are frequently precipitated into this weakne&s;s, merely by reading improper novels. This imbecility of mind becomes the more danger|ous in young people, as it is generally increa&s;|ed by &s;olitude, and their ignorance of the re|al world.&mdash;Exalted ideas of virtue, of magna|nimity, and a generous &s;elf-denial, are excel|lent antidotes; but, if the body &s;ink under
<PB N="227" REF="039111_0550_1013A37A8E36CB40">
the weight of pa&s;&s;ion, even the&s;e exertions are in&s;ufficient to &s;upport the energy of the mind. The phy&s;ical remedies to be re&s;orted to in the&s;e &s;ituations are, rigid temperance, a fru|gal and le&s;s nouri&s;hing diet, con&s;tant employ|ment, and much exerci&s;e; but the mo&s;t &s;uc|ce&s;sful of all, is a happy marriage.</P>
<P>Of all the pa&s;&s;ions that can aid the medical art, there is none from which we may expect greater benefit, than from a rational gratifica|tion of love. On the contrary, a too ardent pa&s;&s;ion is attended with the mo&s;t dangerous phy&s;ical con&s;equences: it is nearly related to di&s;appointed love, and u&s;ually &s;hews it&s;elf by a re&s;erved melancholy, a general di&s;tru&s;t, and a gloomy mi&s;anthropy, which, however, ex|ternally appears only under the character of la&s;&s;itude and depre&s;&s;ion. It is apt to be fol|lowed by a &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the men&s;es, con|&s;umption of the lungs, and even in&s;anity.</P>
<P><HI>Di&s;appointed love</HI> is extremely detrimental to health, and gradually de&s;tructive to the bo|dy; it &s;ometimes produces <HI>furor uterinus</HI> in females of an ira&s;cible temper and romantic turn of mind, unle&s;s the pa&s;&s;ion it&s;elf be radi|cally cured.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t dangerous effect of love is <HI>jeal|ou&s;y;</HI>&mdash;this pitiable pa&s;&s;ion, like di&s;appointed love and pride, is very liable to terminate in madne&s;s.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the hou&s;es appropriated to the unhappy victims of in&s;ani|ty, we generally meet with three different cla&s;&s;es.

<P><HI>Envy</HI> ari&s;es from &s;elf-love or &s;elf-intere&s;t, particularly in &s;uch individuals as have ne|glected to cultivate their own talents, or to whom Nature has denied certain qualifica|tions of body or mind, which they cannot avoid &s;eeing in others: it is principally ex|cited, when they are witne&s;&s;es of the pro&s;per|ity of per&s;ons who po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uch &s;uperior en|dowments. People of a narrow mind, and tho&s;e of a confined education, are mo&s;t &s;ub|ject to this mean pa&s;&s;ion.

<P><HI>Fear</HI> or <HI>anxiety,</HI> is the apprehen&s;ion of evil. Fear weakens the powers of the mind, relaxes and congeals every part of the human body, retards the pul&s;e, hinders re&s;piration, ob&s;tructs the men&s;es, &s;ometimes al&s;o per&s;piration; hence it produces tremor and dread; frequently too it excites per&s;piration, &s;ince it di&s;organizes ev|ery thing linked to the body by means of the nerves. It is apt to occa&s;ion diarrhoea, and, in &s;ome individuals, an involuntary di&s;charge of &s;emen. Some per&s;ons of a relaxed habit are, by great fear, thrown into a per&s;piration re&s;embling the agonies of death; and others cannot retain their urine. Timorous per&s;ons are more readily infected by epidemical di&s;or|ders than tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of courage; becau&s;e fear not only weakens the energy of the heart, but at the &s;ame time promotes the ab&s;orption of the &s;kin, &s;o as to render the timid more lia|ble to contagion. In &s;hort, fear increa&s;es the malignity of di&s;ea&s;es; changes their natural cour&s;e; aggravates them by a thou&s;and inci|dental circum&s;tances, &s;o that they re&s;i&s;t all remedies; and &s;uppre&s;&s;es the efforts of Na|ture &s;o as to terminate in &s;peedy di&s;&s;olution.

fear, produced by a di&s;ordered imagi|nation, are eruptions in the face, &s;wellings, cutaneous inflammations, and painful ulcers. In &s;ome in&s;tances, too, fear has produced pal|&s;y, lo&s;s of &s;peech, epilep&s;y, and even madne&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One in&s;tance of this effect I have my&s;elf witne&s;&s;ed, in a gen|tleman, now living in Edinburgh, who was at Li&s;bon in the awful earthquake of 1755; and who, from the great fright which &s;eized him upon &s;eeing whole &s;treets and churches tumble down before him, has been deprived of his under&s;tanding ever &s;ince.</NOTE> it&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Ba&s;hfulne&s;s</HI> is an inferior degree of fear, which retains the blood in the external ve&s;|&s;els of the brea&s;t, and the whole countenance. Hence, in females of a delicate con&s;titution, and tran&s;parent &s;kin, we ob&s;erve the blu&s;h not only over&s;pread the face but al&s;o the bo&s;om. If carried to a greater degree, it is attended with dangerous con&s;equences, particularly in the individuals before-mentioned: it may &s;top the flux of the men&s;es and prove fatal, if an attack of a fever &s;hould accelerate the cata&s;tro|phe.&mdash;A very high degree of ba&s;hfulne&s;s may generate a dangerous fever, even in men; though, from modern education, in&s;tances of this latter kind become every day more rare. An extravagant degree of ba&s;hfulne&s;s clo&s;ely borders on fear: if it does not proceed from vice or corrupted manners, it may be corrected by &s;ocial intercour&s;e with per&s;ons of a cheer|ful di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P><HI>Terror,</HI> or the dread of an evil &s;urpri&s;ing us, before we are able to prevent it, is of all pa&s;|&s;ions the mo&s;t de&s;tructive, and the mo&s;t diffi|cult to be avoided, becau&s;e its operation is un|fore&s;een and in&s;tantaneous. To &s;hun all occa|&s;ions
<PB N="232" REF="039111_0555_1013A386B700CF80">
that may produce it, is perhaps the only remedy. Per&s;ons who are feeble and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of much &s;en&s;ibility, are mo&s;t &s;ubject to terror, and likewi&s;e mo&s;t affected by it. Its effects are, a &s;udden and violent contraction of almo&s;t every mu&s;cle, that &s;erves to perform the vol|untary motions. It may farther occa&s;ion polypous concretions of the heart, inflamma|tions of the external parts of the body, &s;pa&s;ms, and &s;woons; at the &s;ame time, it may &s;top &s;al|utary evacuations, particularly per&s;piration and hemorrhages; it may repel ulcers and cutane|ous eruptions, to the great detriment of health, and danger of life. The men&s;es are &s;ometimes in&s;tantaneou&s;ly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed: palpitation of the heart, trembling in the limbs, and in a more violent degree, convul&s;ions and epileptic fits, or a general catalep&s;y, and &s;udden death it&s;elf, are the &s;ub&s;equent effects of terror.</P>
<P>As terror quickly compels the blood to re|treat from the &s;kin to the internal parts, it for|cibly checks the circulation of all the fluids. If anger accompany terror, there not unfre|quently ari&s;e violent hemorrhages, vomiting, and apoplexy. Terror has been known &s;ud|denly to turn the hair grey.&mdash;An inattentive and injudicious mode of educating children of|ten lays the foundation of this infirmity, which is difficult to be eradicated at a more advanced age. Per&s;ons under the influence of this pa&s;|&s;ion, &s;hould be treated like tho&s;e who &s;uffer from any other &s;pa&s;modic contraction. Tea, a little wine, or &s;pirits and water may be given to them; vinegar, lavender-drops, or &s;pirits, of hart&s;horn, may be held to the no&s;trils;
<PB N="233" REF="039111_0556_1013A389517B0578">
warm bathing of the feet, and emollient injec|tions may be of advantage; and, la&s;tly, the different evacuations ought to be promoted;&mdash;but, above all, the mind ought to be duly compo&s;ed.</P>
<P><HI>Anger</HI> ari&s;es from a &s;en&s;e or apprehen&s;ion of &s;uffered inju&s;tice, and an impetuous de&s;ire of revenge. Its different degrees depend upon the impre&s;&s;ions made by the injury, or the ar|dour of the di&s;po&s;ition to vengeance. In the former ca&s;e, namely, when the &s;en&s;e of inju&s;|tice is the prevalent feeling, anger affects us like terror, and produces &s;pa&s;modic contrac|tions and &s;tagnations in the liver and its ve&s;&s;els, &s;ometimes &s;o con&s;iderable as to change the bile into a concrete ma&s;s; from this cau&s;e alone often ari&s;e the gravel and &s;tone of the bladder. The more u&s;ual con&s;equences of anger, if join|ed to affliction, are palene&s;s of the face, palpi|tation of the heart, faltering of the tongue, trembling of the limbs, and jaundice.</P>
<P>If, on the contrary, the hope of revenge be the predominant feature in anger, violent com|motions take place in the whole &s;y&s;tem; the circulation of all the fluids, as well as the pul|&s;ations of the heart and arteries, are perceptibly increa&s;ed; the vital &s;pirits flow rapidly but ir|regularly, through the limbs; the mu&s;cles make uncommon efforts, while &s;ome appear almo&s;t pal&s;ied; the face becomes red; the eyes &s;parkle; and the whole body feels elated and inclined to motion. This &s;pecies of anger is by far the mo&s;t common.</P>
<P>Anger and terror are, therefore, particular|ly injurious, to the tender bodies of infants,
<PB N="234" REF="039111_0557_1013A38D14725C18">
who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of extreme &s;en&s;ibility, ea&s;ily affected, and con&s;equently much expo&s;ed to the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, on account of the proportiona|bly greater &s;ize of their nerves, and their ina|bility to re&s;train pa&s;&s;ion by the influence of rea&s;on. They are liable to be &s;o &s;everely af|fected, that they may die &s;uddenly in convul|&s;ions, or retain during life an imbecile body and mind, liable to be terrified upon the &s;light|e&s;t occa&s;ion. When children are apt to cry in &s;leep, when they &s;tart up and make motions indicating fear or terror, it mu&s;t not be always a&s;cribed to actual pain, but frequently to dreams, which fill their young minds with ter|rible images, e&s;pecially if they have often been frightened while awake. All parents know how much &s;ome children are addicted to anger and malice, and how difficult it is to &s;uppre&s;s the ebullition of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions. Hence we ought to beware of giving the mo&s;t di&s;tant en|couragement to &s;uch de&s;tructive emotions. For it is certain, that both men and women of an ira&s;cible temper generally die of a con&s;ump|tion of the lungs.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons of an irritable di&s;po&s;ition are more frequently expo&s;ed to anger than others; they are more ea&s;ily affected by every pa&s;&s;ion. Hence the tendency to anger is particularly vi&s;ible in individuals troubled with hy&s;terics and hypochondria&s;is, as well as in debilitated and di&s;appointed men of letters. Per&s;ons of a hot and dry temperament, of &s;trong black hair, and great mu&s;cular &s;trength, are likewi&s;e much &s;ubject to fits of anger.</P>

A moderate degree of this pa&s;&s;ion is fre|quently of advantage to phlegmatic, gouty, and hypochondriac individuals, as it excites the nerves to action; but, if too violent and raging, it di&s;&s;ipates the more volatile part of the fluids, and is productive of the mo&s;t hurt|ful con&s;equences. In the epileptic, &s;corbutic, choleric, and &s;uch as have open wounds, it cau&s;es fever, &s;pitting of blood, convul&s;ions, inflammations, throbbing pains in the &s;ide, jaundice, apoplexy, &amp;c.</P>

<P>The propen&s;ity to anger is increa&s;ed by want of &s;leep, by heating food and drink, bit|ter &s;ub&s;tances, much animal food, rich &s;oups, &s;pices, and by all things that have a tendency to inflame the blood.

Among other arguments again&s;t anger, young people, e&s;pecially females, &s;hould be informed, that be&s;ides the phy&s;ical dangers attendant on this pa&s;&s;ion, it deforms the face, and, like all the impetuous emotions of the mind, deprives the pa&s;&s;ionate of every charm, and induces a &s;trong aver&s;ion to &s;uch compan|ions.

When &s;adne&s;s or fear have &s;o overpowered the heart and the under&s;tanding, that all hopes of averting the apprehended evils are extin|gui&s;hed, the mind &s;inks into <HI>De&s;pair.</HI> We then &s;ee no comfort in futurity, and our ideas of approaching mi&s;ery become &s;o intolerable, that we think our&s;elves incapable to &s;u&s;tain it, and &s;eek no other remedy but death.

<P>A &s;udden fit of de&s;pair is owing to very irri|table mu&s;cular fibres, which are quickly exci|ted to the mo&s;t irregular motions, and from which ari&s;es confu&s;ion in the &s;en&s;es and the imagination.

From this &s;ource &s;ome authors derive the choleric di&s;po&s;ition of the Briti&s;h in general; but I have endeavoured to prove, in the fifth Chap|ter, on Food and Drink, p. 31 and foll. that this ob&s;ervation cannot be maintained on ra|tional principles, and that it is incon&s;i&s;tent with actual experience.

Too rigid con|ceptions of virtue have al&s;o, though &s;eldom, been the occa&s;ion of this infatuated pa&s;&s;ion. The cautions and rules for preventing de&s;pair and &s;uicide are the &s;ame which mu&s;t be employ|ed to counteract &s;uch other pa&s;&s;ions as depre&s;s the &s;uffering mind; but they mu&s;t be modified according to the temperament of the individ|ual; and the cure of &s;uch evils ought to be directed principally to the body, and partly al&s;o to the mind.</P>

<P>It cannot be doubted, that tho&s;e who, at an early, docile age, combine &s;olid principles of virtue with a &s;ober and active life, and who are by frequent examples reminded of the tur|pitude and di&s;advantages attending violent pa&s;|&s;ions in others, will of them&s;elves repre&s;s the&s;e enemies to human life.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of the different ORGANS OF SENSE, and their re&s;pective functions.&mdash;Of the &s;uppo&s;ed Seat and Operation of the Soul&mdash;Motion&mdash;Mu&s;cular Action.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BEFORE we proceed to inve&s;tigate the pe|culiar functions of the different &s;en&s;es, it will be u&s;eful, if not nece&s;&s;ary, to premi&s;e a &s;hort analy&s;is of <HI>&s;en&s;ation,</HI> or in other words, of the &s;eat and operation of the &s;oul.</P>
<P>The ancients imagined the &s;eat of the &s;oul to be in the &s;tomach, becau&s;e of the acute feel|ing of this organ, and the multitude of nerves with which it is provided, and by which it is connected with other parts. But it is now univer&s;ally admitted by phy&s;iologi&s;ts and anat|omi&s;ts, that the operations of the mind are carried on principally in the brain; that this is the point of union, in which all the nerves meet, and which is to be con&s;idered as the a&s;|&s;emblage of all &s;en&s;ations, or the <HI>&s;en&s;orium com|mune.</HI> The brain is in the mo&s;t immediate connection with the perceptive faculty; and here all the nerves are as it were concentrated into one point.</P>
<P>Prof. SOEMMERING, of Mayence, has lately endeavoured to prove in a very ingenious pub|lication, that the ventricles of the brain prop|erly contain the more immediate cau&s;e of the various operations of the &s;oul; that there is
<PB N="243" REF="039111_0566_1013A3A4DD4D1940">
a fluid, or at lea&s;t a &s;ubtile vapour, &s;ecreted from the&s;e parts, in con&s;equence of the activi|ty of the mind exerci&s;ed in the ventricles of the brain; and that all the varieties of intellect, in human beings, depend upon the diver&s;ity of the &s;tructure of the&s;e ventricles, and the va|rious &s;tates of vigour and mental energy there exerted.</P>
<P>Without attempting to decide upon a que&s;|tion &s;o remote from human inve&s;tigatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, I may be allowed to ob&s;erve, that all conjectures re&s;pecting the &s;eat of the &s;oul are in reality frivolous and un&s;atisfactory, until we have a&s;|certained, in what manner the important func|tions of the brain, which is intimately connect|ed and thoroughly blended with the nerves, are affected within the cranium; whether this be done by vibrations, by &s;ecretions of hu|mours or vapours; or by the peculiar manner in which the numerous blood-ve&s;&s;els are di&s;|po&s;ed in the brain, &s;o as to allow the blood to exert its influence, and to produce all the changes there, by the force and momentum of its own circulation;&mdash;all the&s;e particulars mu&s;t be a&s;certained, before we can form a deci&s;ive opinion re&s;pecting the &s;ituation of the &s;oul.</P>
<P>This much, however, is certain, that one of the principal offices of the nerves con&s;i&s;ts in communicating to the brain tho&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, which are made on the body by external ob|jects. As &s;oon as, by means of this commu|nication, a certain change takes place in the brain, the mind becomes con&s;cious of it. But every perception mu&s;t be acquired through
<PB N="244" REF="039111_0567_1013A3A6618275F0">
the &s;en&s;es; becau&s;e the impre&s;&s;ions, of what|ever kind, mu&s;t previou&s;ly &s;trike the organs of &s;en&s;e, before they can be communicated to the nerves.</P>
<P>Although it be e&s;tabli&s;hed and admitted, that the nerves are the medium of all the opera|tions between body and mind; yet no phi|lo&s;opher has hitherto been able to di&s;cover the ultimate chain or link by which they are connected, or the exact point in which they meet. Much, however, depends here upon our idea of the mind. It appears, from the contradictory opinions which, from time to time, have prevailed on this intere&s;ting &s;ubject, that the inquirers have been too much in the habit of evading the materiality of the &s;oul; and yet they a&s;&s;igned it a certain place of re&s;i|dence in the body, which to this day is imag|ined to be in either one or other part of the brain. I conceive the &s;oul to be the primary animating power and the maximum of all pow|ers in the animal body. And why &s;hould we he&s;itate to con&s;ider matter (of the <HI>primary</HI> prop|erties of which we are but little informed) as perfectly &s;imple and yet extremely operative?</P>
<P>The mind, then, is probably not confined to any particular part of the body, neither exclu|&s;ively to the brain, to the &s;tomach, nor to the blood; but di&s;tributed through the whole &s;y&s;|tem, always one and the &s;ame power, &s;ave that it is &s;ometimes more, &s;ometimes le&s;s concen|trated; and, if I may be permitted to &s;ay &s;o, it is a pure, elementary, ethereal agent. In the <HI>brain</HI> it di&s;plays its principal energies: here are &s;eated con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, the capacity of
<PB N="245" REF="039111_0568_1013A3A7F021EE10">
thinking and judging, memory, and all the higher faculties of the mind. But again, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that different parts of the brain &s;eem to contain different faculties; &s;o that memory, probably, occupies more the ex|ternal cru&s;t, and the power of thinking, the in|terior &s;ub&s;tance of the brain.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to memory, it is remarkable, that nervous and epileptic patients are u&s;ually deprived of that faculty, before any other of their mental powers are impaired. Perhaps the efficient cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e has not pene|trated the brain deep enough, &s;o as to affect the &s;eat of the under&s;tanding and judgment; till at length, with the progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e, the higher powers of the mind become affected.</P>
<P>Even the lower faculties, the emotions of the mind, and the various pa&s;&s;ions, appear to be &s;ituated in different organs. Thus, the &s;eat of terror and anger &s;eems to be in the &s;tom|ach, and in the biliary &s;y&s;tem; the more ami|able feelings, as philanthropy, compa&s;&s;ion, hope, love, &amp;c. &s;eem to be &s;ituated in the heart; fear and &s;urpri&s;e, in the external &s;ur|face of the head and back; and &s;udden pain, in the brea&s;t.</P>
<P>The next que&s;tion ari&s;es, how are the&s;e pow|ers put in motion? Has the a&s;&s;emblage of the&s;e faculties, or the <HI>&s;en&s;orium commune,</HI> an original and independent capacity of receiving ideas; of forming new ones from its own materials; of being con&s;cious of the&s;e internal &s;en&s;ations, and of comparing them, &s;o as to reproduce others, through it&s;elf, and from its own origin? I am inclined to an&s;wer the&s;e que&s;tions in the
<PB N="246" REF="039111_0569_1013A3AD0B7BCDD8">
affirmative. For, as &s;oon as the &s;en&s;es are &s;timulated, the &s;en&s;ation is communicated to the &s;en&s;orium, where it makes a real, corpore|al, and &s;en&s;ible impre&s;&s;ion. All this is accom|pli&s;hed by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the nerves, becau&s;e the nervous energy appears to be more nearly al|lied to the mind, than any other power. The more frequently, therefore, the &s;ame &s;timulus and impre&s;&s;ion is repeated, the more firmly the idea of it is imprinted, and the longer we retain the impre&s;&s;ion. If the &s;timulus be too violent and permanent, or if an impre&s;&s;ion of too many objects be at once made on the brain, our nerves experience the &s;ame relaxation as the chords of an in&s;trument, after a &s;trong and repeated ten&s;ion.</P>
<P>Man, when he is without clear con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s, and in the moment of confu&s;ion, feels as if his mental powers were pal&s;ied, or had &s;uffer|ed a temporary &s;u&s;pen&s;ion. In a &s;evere di&s;ea&s;e, and previous to death, we perceive the ideas of early life vani&s;h fir&s;t; we lo&s;e the impre&s;|&s;ions of &s;uch ideas on the brain more readily, in proportion to the di&s;tance of time when they were made, or accordingly as they have been more or le&s;s frequently repeated. If eventually the patient recover, he may with|out difficulty ob&s;erve, how progre&s;&s;ively the &s;uppre&s;&s;ed ideas re-appear in the head, exactly as if they had been &s;tored up there, and re|mained in a latent &s;tate, till the &s;oul attained &s;ufficient energy to u&s;e them.&mdash;From this in|dubitable fact, I am di&s;po&s;ed to deduce a &s;tronger argument for the immortality of the &s;oul, than from any other phy&s;iological &s;ource.</P>

The organs by which the &s;en&s;itive powers of the nerves can be excited from without, are called the &s;en&s;es; in contradi&s;tinction to the <HI>internal</HI> faculties, &s;uch as imagination, mem|ory, attention, and the various affections of the mind. The latter we exclude from the pre&s;ent inquiry, which is directed to the <HI>exter|nal</HI> &s;en&s;es alone. The number of the&s;e has been hitherto limited to <HI>five,</HI> or, it may be &s;aid with more propriety, that they are five modifications of <HI>one</HI> &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>This univer&s;al &s;en&s;e, which in a manner forms the ba&s;is of all others, is that of <HI>Touch.</HI> If we ab&s;tract from the difference &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in the &s;tructure of the organs, the other &s;en&s;es are &s;ub&s;ervient to that of touch, and little more than a variety or modification of it. All the &s;en&s;es agree in this, that they may be improved by exerci&s;e, or depraved and blunt|ed by neglect: Nature has not formed them to the &s;ame degree of perfection in every in|dividual. The lo&s;s of one &s;en&s;e is, in general, partly &s;upplied by the greater perfection of another; yet it is equally true, that exerci&s;e and attention are the principal &s;ources of this improvement.</P>
<P>In the mo&s;t perfect &s;tate of our &s;en&s;es, we are liable to be mi&s;led by them into many errors and mi&s;takes; but the &s;en&s;e of touch or feeling is lea&s;t liable to deceptions, while that of &s;ight is the mo&s;t uncertain. The or|der in which we &s;hall con&s;ider the five &s;en&s;es, hitherto admitted as being di&s;tinct from one another, is the following: <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> 1. <HI>Touch;</HI> 2. <HI>Sight;</HI> 3. <HI>Hearing;</HI> 4. <HI>Smell;</HI> and 5. <HI>Ta&s;te.</HI>

&mdash;Be&s;ide the&s;e, there are perhaps &s;everal oth|ers, which de&s;erve to be added to that num|ber; &s;uch as hunger and thir&s;t, and the &s;en|&s;ations peculiar to the different &s;exes. If the&s;e be not admitted as di&s;tinct from the five oth|ers, we may &s;till di&s;cover a <HI>&s;ixth</HI> &s;en&s;e in the animal oeconomy. And though this addi|tional &s;en&s;e is chiefly manife&s;ted in di&s;ea&s;es, and &s;carcely perceptible in a healthy &s;tate of the body, yet its exi&s;tence is &s;o obvious to pa|tients in chronic di&s;orders, and particularly in pal&s;y, gout, and rheumati&s;m, that they are thereby enabled to a&s;certain, with wonderful accuracy, not only the pre&s;ent &s;tate, but al&s;o to predict the impending changes of the at|mo&s;phere.</P>
<P>Without lo&s;ing time in ab&s;tru&s;e di&s;qui&s;itions re&s;pecting the&s;e occult &s;en&s;es, I proceed to examine tho&s;e which are more generally known.</P>
<P>The <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> namely, that of <HI>Touch,</HI> compre|hends not only the &s;en&s;ation which is excited by any particular impre&s;&s;ion, but al&s;o that change which external objects produce on the &s;kin, and particularly on the ends of the fin|gers. It is in the latter, and more limited meaning, that I now con&s;ider the &s;en&s;e of touch. In order to under&s;tand more clearly the great importance of this &s;en&s;e, I &s;hall pre|mi&s;e a conci&s;e de&s;cription of the external in|teguments of the human body. For there is no doubt, that the &s;kin is the medium of all the &s;en&s;es, and, if I may be allowed the ex|pre&s;&s;ion, it is the mo&s;t unerring guide, and lea&s;t &s;ubject to the illu&s;ions of the imagination.</P>

The whole human body is inclo&s;ed in cer|tain integuments or covers: they con&s;i&s;t of <HI>three</HI> different layers, each of which is wi&s;ely de&s;igned by Nature for protection, benefit, and ornament. The uppermo&s;t, that is, the &s;carf-&s;kin, or <HI>epidermis,</HI> is the thinne&s;t of the three, and is nearly tran&s;parent. It covers the whole body, both externally and internal|ly, not only the mouth, &s;tomach, and bowels, but al&s;o every cavity and protuberance of the body; as it forms the upper &s;kin of mo&s;t of the inte&s;tines, the lungs, the heart, the liver, the &s;pleen, &amp;c. This covering is of great &s;er|vice to the whole frame, by protecting the parts inclo&s;ed in it from external injury, by preventing them from growing together in|ternally, and by keeping every thing within the body in its proper &s;ituation.

But it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the admirable property, that it is very quickly renewed, af|ter it has been de&s;troyed by accident, or by the mea&s;les, &s;carlet-fever, and &s;imilar di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>Immediately under this univer&s;al and up|permo&s;t covering of our body, there lies a &s;econd, reticular, and mucous membrane, which has received from anatomi&s;ts the name of <HI>rete muco&s;um.</HI> It is in mo&s;t parts of the body extremely thin, but it grows con&s;idera|bly thicker in others, for in&s;tance, on the heels and the palms of the hand.</P>
<P>This &s;econd &s;kin de&s;erves particular atten|tion, as it is the &s;eat of the colour in different nations; though the cau&s;e of this diver&s;ity has
<PB N="250" REF="039111_0573_1013A3B7D73F9190">
not yet been di&s;covered:&mdash;in the Negroes it is black; in the American Indians nearly of copper colour; and in the Europeans gener|ally white. That the colour of the human body is altogether contained in this &s;econd or middle &s;kin, is &s;ufficiently a&s;certained; for not only the third or true &s;kin of the Ne|groes is as white as in the Europeans, but the uppermo&s;t, or &s;carf-&s;kin too, though rather of a greyi&s;h tint, is &s;carcely darker in blacks than in white people; and in the latter al&s;o the middle &s;kin frequently is of a yellowi&s;h, brown, or blacki&s;h colour; in which ca&s;e the whole external &s;kin exhibits a &s;imilar appear|ance.</P>
<P>This variety of colour has led &s;ome au|thors to &s;uppo&s;e, that there is a variety in the origin, as well as in the mental capacities of different nations. So palpable an error, how|ever, could not long remain unrefuted: and it is now almo&s;t univer&s;ally admitted, that there was originally but one &s;pecies of man, though diver&s;ified by the climate, the air, the &s;un, and the mode of living, which produce all the difference in the colour, as well as in the &s;tructure of man. Thus we know that tho&s;e Americans, who live in the calmer we&s;t|ern and mountainous regions, are not of &s;o deep a copper-colour as tho&s;e who are more expo&s;ed to winds and other contingent cau&s;es; that the inhabitants of the northern bank of the river Senegal are of a diminutive &s;ize, and of an a&s;h-colour, while tho&s;e of the oppo|&s;ite bank are black, and at the &s;ame time tall and robu&s;t. We farther know, that after
<PB N="251" REF="039111_0574_1013A3B95D9FB1C8">
&s;ome generations, the Negroes are bleached, and people of a white colour become black, when the former emigrate to the cold north|ern, and the latter to the torrid &s;outhern cli|mates. This difference is al&s;o di&s;coverable in our climate, where people moving much in the open air and &s;un&s;hine acquire a dark col|our, &s;omewhat re&s;embling that of the &s;warthy Portugue&s;e.</P>
<P>That there may be al&s;o a colouring &s;ub|&s;tance in the blood, whether owing to the iron &s;aid to be contained in this fluid, to the bile, or to an exce&s;s of what the old chemi&s;ts call|ed <HI>phlogi&s;ton</HI> (or what would now be termed the want of <HI>oxygen</HI>)&mdash;all of which may have a &s;hare in the modification of colours, I am much di&s;po&s;ed to admit; becau&s;e the blood, bile, brain, nay the very vermin on the bo|dies of the AEthiopians, partake of their native colour.</P>
<P>The <HI>third</HI> and innermo&s;t of the integuments of our body is the true &s;kin, or the <HI>cutis vera,</HI> which immediately covers the fat and the mu&s;cles. It is of a compact, interwoven, cel|lular texture, which is very thick and &s;mooth on its upper &s;urface, of a white colour in all nations, loo&s;e or pliable on its inner &s;urface, and furni&s;hed with more or le&s;s fat. It not only po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a con&s;iderable degree of expan|&s;ibility, and contractility, but is al&s;o provided with numberle&s;s pores. Its thickne&s;s varies in different individuals. It is traver&s;ed by a great number of fine arteries, interwoven in the form of a net, and which may be exhibit|ed to the eye by injecting them with a red flu|id,
<PB N="252" REF="039111_0575_1013A3BBF299B470">
&s;o that the &s;kin then has the appearance of being thoroughly coloured. It is likewi&s;e fur|ni&s;hed with an equal number of veins, and delicate ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>From the many nerves which pervade the true &s;kin, it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es an uncommon degree of &s;en&s;ibility, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e parts where we can perceive the <HI>papillae</HI> of the nerves. The&s;e are &s;mall portuberances of different figures, of a reticular &s;tructure, and a pulpy con&s;i&s;tence. In &s;ome places, as the lips, they are not unlike flakes, though they generally re&s;emble little warts, &s;uch we ob&s;erve on the points of the fingers and toes, as well as on many of the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible parts of the body, but particular|ly the tongue. They are mo&s;t vi&s;ible on the ends of the fingers in delicate per&s;ons; they can be traced, with the naked eye, by the &s;pi|ral lines terminating almo&s;t in a point, and are protected and &s;upported by nails proceeding from the &s;kin which grows over them. It is in the&s;e papillary extremities, that every ex|ternal impre&s;&s;ion is mo&s;t di&s;tinctly and forcibly perceived, on account of the number of nerves lying almo&s;t expo&s;ed to view in the&s;e places.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;e of touch can be improved, by practice, to an a&s;toni&s;hing degree. There are many examples of blind people having attain|ed &s;o great a perfection of this &s;en&s;e, that they could with accuracy di&s;tingui&s;h the difference of coins, of metals, and even of colours, mere|ly by the touch. I my&s;elf knew a blind man, who had learnt to take a watch to pieces, to clean it perfectly, and to put it together again, without any other a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but that of the
<PB N="253" REF="039111_0576_1013A3BD8596C558">
in&s;truments commonly u&s;ed, and the exqui&s;ite feeling of his fingers.</P>
<P>I have now only to de&s;cribe the operation or mechani&s;m of this &s;en&s;e.&mdash;When the nervous papillae are pre&s;&s;ed again&s;t external objects, the nerves receive a kind of vibration, which is communicated to their branches, and thence to the brain. Thus we are enabled to feel the hardne&s;s, roughne&s;s, moi&s;ture, warmth, gravi|ty, figure, &s;ize, and even the di&s;tance of bodies. But, that this feeling may not become painful, Nature has provided another cover, namely the &s;carf-&s;kin, which &s;erves the important pur|po&s;es of &s;ecluding the air from the true &s;kin, and preventing the body from being too much dried.&mdash;The nails increa&s;e the energy of touch, and render the &s;en&s;e of it more acute, as they re&s;i&s;t the pre&s;&s;ure of external objects.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;econd</HI> of our &s;en&s;es, though le&s;s e&s;&s;en|tial to animal life, is more conducive to our welfare and happine&s;s. Without <HI>Sight</HI> we can|not ju&s;tly contemplate the wonders of Nature, and exi&s;tence is deprived of its greate&s;t charms. An anatomical de&s;cription of the eyes would lead us too far from the object of the&s;e inquir|ies, and would not be intelligible without a more particular analy&s;is and demon&s;tration than our limits allow.</P>
<P>In the &s;en&s;e of &s;ight, we are far excelled by mo&s;t of the lower animals. Eagles and hawks, in particular, de&s;cry their prey, when beyond the reach of our &s;ight, though aided by a tel|e&s;cope. Yet in men, al&s;o, this &s;en&s;e may be wonderfully improved, and I remember to have heard the celebrated <HI>Baron Trenk</HI> a&s;&s;ert,
<PB N="254" REF="039111_0577_1013A3C033125B28">
that during his long captivity in the &s;tate dun|geon at Magdeburg, he had &s;o much improved his &s;ight, that he could &s;ee the mice traver&s;ing his gloomy cell in the middle of the darke&s;t night&mdash;whether this a&s;&s;ertion was exaggerated, I do not pretend to decide.</P>
<P>The operations of &s;ight are performed in the mo&s;t accurate manner. By the &s;tructure of the eye, no rays of light can pa&s;s into it, unle&s;s emitted within an angle not exceeding 90 degrees. Every thing here is regulated upon optical principles, &s;en&s;ation excepted. This is &s;ituated in the <HI>retina,</HI> a membrane hav|ing the form of a net, and being, as it were, the mirror by which external objects are rep|re&s;ented to the mind. If this mirror be de|&s;troyed, as is the ca&s;e in <HI>amauro&s;is,</HI> or <HI>gutta &s;e|rena,</HI> our &s;ight is irrecoverably lo&s;t.</P>
<P>All vi&s;ion con&s;i&s;ts in the refraction of the rays of light, by means of the cry&s;talline hu|mour, till all the rays are concentrated into one di&s;tinct image on the retina. The rays of light, while they pa&s;s through the arched &s;urface of the <HI>cornea,</HI> or the horny &s;kin, are broken and brought in contact with each other; and this is &s;till farther promoted, while they pa&s;s through the more den&s;e cry&s;talline lens. They then converge at the &s;pot where the vitreous hu|mour is contained: here they again diverge, once more come in contact, and finally collect in as many points as are repre&s;ented by the ex|ternal object. This image, which is depicted on, and &s;timulates the retina, is communica|ted to the mind, and produces the &s;en&s;ation of &s;ight.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="039111_0578_1013A3C4E9483CC0">
It is partly owing to the above-mentioned refraction, partly to the con&s;tant and uniform reference to the internal &s;en&s;e, that in the act of vi&s;ion we &s;ee objects in an upright po&s;ture before us, though they are properly imprint|ed on the retina, in an inverted po&s;ture. By this admirable mechani&s;m, all objects are in|vertedly pre&s;ented to the eye, &s;o that we can|not err in this re&s;pect, &s;ince the relation and proportion of things uniformly remain the &s;ame.</P>
<P>But it will be a&s;ked, how does it happen, that with two eyes, we &s;ee only one object? This que&s;tion is ea&s;ily an&s;wered by tho&s;e, who inform us, that with two no&s;trils we are &s;en&s;i|ble of only one particular &s;mell, and with two ears we hear but one di&s;tinct &s;ound; that a &s;imilar external &s;timulus, in &s;imilar nerves, will always produce the &s;ame internal &s;en&s;ation, and that accidental deviations, or di&s;ea&s;es on|ly, can affect this principle. Yet the expla|nation now given is altogether in&s;ufficient, as it proceeds from analogical rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>If we wi&s;h to form a clear conception of this faculty, we mu&s;t above all things direct our at|tention to the <HI>axis</HI> of vi&s;ion, or that imagina|ry line, which we draw in a &s;traight direction from the centre of the eye to the object, and which is prolonged before and behind that or|gan. We mu&s;t next advert to the &s;ituation in which the eyes are placed. They do not lie perfectly &s;traight in their &s;ockets, but &s;ome|what in an oblique direction towards the no&s;e. If, then, we prolong, for a &s;hort &s;pace only, the axis beyond the eye, we &s;hall &s;oon find,
<PB N="256" REF="039111_0579_1013A3C66F4F01F8">
that the two imaginary lines meet in a certain point. This is called the <HI>Focus,</HI> or the point of vi&s;ion&mdash;the termination of the external rays of light.</P>
<P>If a per&s;on be able to &s;ee to a great di&s;tance, his lines of vi&s;ion inter&s;ect each other at a greater di&s;tance from the eye, and con&s;equent|ly his focus is farther removed from it. This defect is called <HI>pre&s;byopia,</HI> or far-&s;ightedne&s;s, and may be remedied by means of convex gla&s;&s;es; but, if from the too great convexity, or an extraordinary converging power of the eye, the rays of light too &s;oon unite in one point, and, as this point is placed before the retina, from whence the rays of light again diverge, vi&s;ion becomes indi&s;tinct, till the ob|ject be brought nearer to the eye; in order to place the point of union, as it were, farther behind the eye&mdash;this deficiency of vi&s;ion is called <HI>myopia,</HI> or &s;hort-&s;ightedne&s;s, and may be relieved by concave gla&s;&s;es. Of the&s;e, as well as other defects of the eye, and the mo&s;t proper methods of preventing and curing them, I &s;hall treat in the next Chapter.</P>
<P>It farther de&s;erves to be remarked, that the optic nerves cro&s;s each other in the brain, and that we are accu&s;tomed, from our infancy, to &s;ee only one object at a time. Hence chil|dren &s;hould be &s;o placed in bed, that they may not learn to &s;quint, or that the eyes may not be directed upwards and outwards, but rather downwards and inwards, in order to habituate them properly to form the axis above de&s;crib|ed. That cu&s;tom has great influence, in this re&s;pect, is obvious from the circum&s;tance, that
<PB N="257" REF="039111_0580_1013A3C8F851B1B0">
tho&s;e who &s;quint, not unfrequently &s;ee two objects at once; and that &s;uch eyes, as by ac|cident or di&s;ea&s;e have become double-&s;ighted, may, by continued exertions, be again habit|uated to view objects di&s;tinctly.</P>
<P>Every one mu&s;t have ob&s;erved, that upon en|tering &s;uddenly from a very dark place into bright &s;un&s;hine, he could &s;carcely &s;ee any ob|ject, has felt pain in the eyes, &s;hed involuntary tears, or &s;neezed. This temporary deprivation of &s;ight is owing to the pupil of the eye being dilated in a dark place, and contracted again at the approach of light. The dilatation and contraction of the pupil is in proportion to the darkne&s;s or brightne&s;s of the place. If the change from a dark to a bright place be in|&s;tantaneous, the pupil cannot dilate and con|tract quickly enough; it is, as it were, pal&s;ied, together with the retina, and we cannot &s;ee at all. The pain of the eyes, and the flow of tears under the&s;e circum&s;tances, mu&s;t be a&s;|cribed to &s;imilar cau&s;es. Every &s;timulus wheth|er occa&s;ioned by heat, cold, winds, colours, and the like, excites a &s;en&s;ation, which is agreeable, if it be moderate and not too long continued; but which becomes painful and di&s;agreeable, as it increa&s;es in violence and du|ration. There remains another curious phe|nomenon to be explained, namely, that of <HI>&s;neezing,</HI> which often takes place, when we &s;uddenly go from darkne&s;s to a &s;trong light. Here the &s;ame cau&s;e operates, though under different circum&s;tances. The optic nerves con&s;i&s;t of the &s;econd pair of the nerves of the
<PB N="258" REF="039111_0581_1013A3CCAE3ED248">
brain; with the&s;e are united the third pair, the fourth pair, and &s;ome branches of the fifth and &s;ixth pair. Yet the &s;econd pair, or the peculiar optic nerve, has the mo&s;t important &s;hare in vi&s;ion. It proceeds from the brain &s;traight to the pupil of the eye, pervades this almo&s;t through the middle of its po&s;terior in|ternal part, where it terminates and dilates it|&s;elf, or, as it were, melts into a &s;oft, downy &s;kin, forming the <HI>retina,</HI> which covers a great part of the po&s;terior internal eye.&mdash;Now, from the fifth pair of nerves there proceeds but one branch into the eyes, while another takes its direction to the no&s;e. When the eye is &s;ud|denly impre&s;&s;ed with the rays of light, that branch of the fifth pair which extends to the eyes, is &s;timulated in common with the other branch of the &s;ame pair proceeding to the no&s;e. If the &s;timulus be violent, it is communicated to both branches, that of the no&s;e is likewi&s;e &s;timulated, and we are compelled to &s;neeze.</P>
<P>To conclude the account of the &s;en&s;e of &s;ight, I mu&s;t remark, that the repre&s;entations of the mind &s;carcely di&s;play their influence on any other of the &s;en&s;es, to &s;o exten&s;ive a de|gree, as they do upon this: hence it happens, that we &s;ometimes imagine we &s;ee images be|fore us, in the cleare&s;t manner, though the rep|re&s;entation of them be merely a phantom of the brain. The impre&s;&s;ion forcibly made on the retina, remains there for &s;ome time, even after the object it&s;elf has vani&s;hed; thus we imagine we &s;ee a fiery ring, when a burning coal is &s;wiftly moved in a circle.&mdash;That we be|lieve we &s;ee many bright colours, when we
<PB N="259" REF="039111_0582_1013A3CF47CC1800">
rub and pre&s;s the clo&s;ed eye with the fingers, is owing to this cau&s;e, that the &s;ame kind of effect is produced on the nerves of the eye by friction, as u&s;ually accompanies the view of the colours them&s;elves. But whether colours, in general, depend on the different degrees of vibration of the air, or on the elements of the rays of light, which, by their divi&s;ion, appear &s;ingly and di&s;tinctly in the pri&s;m, is a problem not yet, and which perhaps never will be, &s;at|isfactorily &s;olved.</P>
<P>By the next &s;en&s;e, namely, that of <HI>Hearing,</HI> we perceive the vibrations of the air which oc|ca&s;ion &s;ound. For this purpo&s;e our ears are formed partly of cartilages, and partly of bones, in order to communicate the&s;e vibra|tions to the auditory nerves, and thence to the brain. This &s;en&s;e al&s;o is more acute in the lower animals, than in the human &s;pecies. The hare, for in&s;tance, is warned again&s;t ap|proaching danger, by her exqui&s;itely fine ear; and the owl, being &s;en&s;ible of the &s;ofte&s;t &s;ounds, makes u&s;e of her acute ear to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in the di&s;covery of prey.</P>
<P>The warm-blooded animals have an external and an internal ear; but in almo&s;t every &s;pecies it is of a different &s;tructure. Mo&s;t animals can move their ears&mdash;an advantage not enjoyed by man; though it was not Nature which formed our ears immoveable, but an ab&s;urd cu&s;tom, continued for many centuries, grad|ually produced this effect. That the ears were not naturally de&s;igned to lie flat on the head, is &s;ufficiently obvious from the number of mu&s;cles with which they are provided, and
<PB N="260" REF="039111_0583_1013A3D0CC7FEBB0">
each of which is de&s;igned to perform different motions.</P>
<P>The manner in which the &s;en&s;e of hearing is produced, is &s;hortly this. The vibrations of the air, which take place by the concu&s;&s;ion of any ela&s;tic body, fir&s;t &s;trike the external ear; hence the &s;ound agitates the <HI>tympanum.</HI> But that the vibrations may not become too violent, and the tympanum may not bur&s;t, as is to be apprehended from a very loud and near &s;ound, the ear is provided with a &s;iphon, which anat|omi&s;ts call the <HI>Eu&s;tachian tube,</HI> and through which the air collected on the tympanum again e&s;capes. But the vibration of the tympanum is al&s;o communicated through the four little bones of the ear; it is forwarded through what is called the <HI>&s;tapes,</HI> or &s;tirrup, to the ve&s;tibule, or the fir&s;t entrance, and through the mem|brane of the <HI>fene&s;tra rotunda,</HI> as far as the in|nermo&s;t cavity of the ear, which re&s;embles the &s;hell of a &s;nail, and is therefore called <HI>coch|lea.</HI> The whole labyrinth of the ear being fill|ed with a &s;ubtile water in &s;mall quantity, this fluid gently agitates the &s;ub&s;tance of the audi|tory nerve; in con&s;equence of which &s;ound is communicated to the brain. The humour contained in the labyrinth of the ear obviou&s;ly &s;erves the purpo&s;e of preventing the &s;oft, pap|py &s;ub&s;tance of the auditory nerve from being too violently agitated.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of the cochlea, which is very arti|ficially con&s;tructed, cannot be ea&s;ily deter|mined; it is probably rather de&s;igned for the more accurate di&s;tinction of the varieties of tones, than for the perception of &s;ounds in
<PB N="261" REF="039111_0584_1013A3D257FE1318">
general; for we may con&s;ider the delicate nerves, that run along the &s;piral line of this cochlea, as a number of chords growing pro|gre&s;&s;ively &s;horter, and which, in a manner, re|peat the external vibrations of the air, in the internal parts of the ear. This repetition ap|pears to be performed according to a geomet|rical &s;cale, &s;ince the &s;ame vibrations of the air take place here in a reduced proportion. Hence &s;ounds, which are too loud and pene|trating, offend our ears, becau&s;e they &s;hake the auditory nerves too quickly and violently, &s;o that the&s;e may even be lacerated, and pro|duce deafne&s;s; but this is not the ca&s;e, when the tympanum is broken by accident.</P>
<P>Some per&s;ons, who are defective in this &s;en&s;e, are obliged to make u&s;e of ear-trumpets, and to turn their ear to the quarter whence the &s;ound proceeds; to place the hand at the &s;ide of the ear; to open their mouth, or u&s;e &s;ome other a&s;&s;i&s;tant means. All this is done with a view to &s;upply the motion of the ears, of which we have been deprived by habits contrary to the laws of Nature: the&s;e motions the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> animals perform, by pointing their ears in the direction from which the &s;ound proceeds. In this manner, the ear receives a greater pro|portion of &s;ound; and many divi&s;ions of it, which might otherwi&s;e e&s;cape, are conveyed to the nerves.</P>
<P>By means of the teeth, and other bones of the head, &s;ounds may be conducted to the au|ditory nerves, &s;o as to communicate the nece&s;|&s;ary vibrations to the internal ear, though we can hear more ea&s;ily and di&s;tinctly, when the
<PB N="262" REF="039111_0585_1013A3D4ED993BA8">
&s;ound comes through the organ it&s;elf. There is, however, a method of communicating &s;ounds to the deaf, with better &s;ucce&s;s than by the common ear-trumpets, which in&s;truments, at length entirely de&s;troy that &s;en&s;e. This is effected by means of a cylindrical rod or tube of ivory, or any &s;imilar hard &s;ub&s;tance: the rod may be from &s;ix to twelve inches long and upwards, and from a quarter to half an inch in diameter; if it be made hollow through|out, the part which is placed in the mouth between the front teeth ought to have a much &s;maller aperture than the other extremity. This tube is well calculated to a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e deaf per&s;ons, who wi&s;h to enjoy the mu&s;ic of a harp, harp&s;ichord, or other in&s;trument. I once knew a gentleman, who was quite deaf, but with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a cylinder, &s;uch as I have de&s;cribed, was enabled to hear the &s;ofte&s;t notes di&s;tinctly, and to enjoy all the plea&s;ures of mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, it is a fal&s;e a&s;&s;ertion, that there is al|ways a hole in the tympanum; for it is owing to the double opening of the Eu&s;tachian tube, that many jugglers can cau&s;e the liquor they drink to flow out of the ear, in the &s;ame man|ner as they di&s;charge the &s;moke of tobacco through the no&s;e and ears.</P>
<P>Our <HI>fourth</HI> &s;en&s;e is that of <HI>Smell.</HI> It is near|ly related to the &s;en&s;e of ta&s;te, probably from the great &s;imilarity of &s;tructure in the organs of the&s;e two &s;en&s;es, and their vicinity to each other. This is attended with the manife&s;t ad|vantage, that man and animals are generally enabled to di&s;cover, without danger, any un|whole&s;ome
<PB N="263" REF="039111_0586_1013A3D994EC56A8">
food. The functions of this &s;en&s;e are exerci&s;ed by the no&s;e, and chiefly by the mucous membrane which lines that organ. The whole in&s;ide of the no&s;e is covered with this membrane, which is a continuation of the general integuments of the body, but much &s;ofter, more mucous and porous, full of ve&s;|&s;els, exqui&s;itely &s;en&s;ible, and covered with hair towards the lower part of the no&s;trils, to prevent any impurities from a&s;cending too far.</P>
<P>Of all the parts of the mouth connected with the no&s;e, the mo&s;t remarkable is the cavity of the jaw-bone, or the <HI>&s;inus maxillaris,</HI> which extends over the whole breadth of the two up|per jaw-bones, and opens it&s;elf into the no&s;e between the middle and lower &s;hell. In new|born children, all the&s;e cavities are not yet formed, and this is the cau&s;e of their imper|fect &s;mell. In order to moi&s;ten the membranes, which otherwi&s;e would become too dry, by the air we inhale through the no&s;trils, there de|&s;cends a na&s;al canal from each cavity of the eyes, which communicates with the lower &s;hell, in order to conduct the tears continually into the no&s;e.</P>
<P>If we make an effort to &s;mell, we draw up the air filled with the volatile, oily, and &s;aline particles of odorous &s;ub&s;tances: the&s;e particles come in contact with the fine branches of the olfactory nerves, which have the capacity of receiving impre&s;&s;ions, and thus the &s;en&s;ation is imparted to the brain. The&s;e nerves ri&s;e immediately from the brain, and are larger in many animals than in man. The bigne&s;s of the nerves, however, is no proof of the great|er
<PB N="264" REF="039111_0587_1013A3DC2A381EE8">
degree of &s;en&s;ation in the animal, or of the &s;uperior abilities of the mind. On the con|trary, it is now pretty generally believed, that the mental capacities of organized beings are in an inverted proportion to the &s;ize of the nerves ri&s;ing out of the brain, and the medul|lary &s;ub&s;tance of the &s;pine. Thus, for in&s;tance, the amphibious animals have &s;trong nerves, in proportion to their &s;mall brain, and yet they are, in general, extremely in&s;en&s;ible and &s;tupid. Lean people, and ricketty children, on the contrary, have very thin and fine nerves to a large brain; and who has not ob|&s;erved their &s;en&s;ibility of mind, as well as their quick and acute feelings?</P>
<P>But to return from this digre&s;&s;ion.&mdash;The &s;aline and oily particles which affect the &s;mell, are more volatile and &s;ubtile than tho&s;e di&s;|tingui&s;hed by the ta&s;te; yet this difference may in a great mea&s;ure ari&s;e from the nerves of the tongue being covered with thicker membranes than tho&s;e of the no&s;e.&mdash;In many animals, the &s;en&s;e of &s;melling is more acute than in man, who would probably be much incommoded by too refined a perception of this kind. But it may be much improved by exerci&s;e, or depraved by neglect. Hence the American Indian can di&s;cover the foot&s;teps of man and other animals by &s;mell alone;&mdash;while per&s;ons who live in a bad and fetid at|mo&s;phere, are &s;carcely &s;en&s;ible of the differ|ence between the mo&s;t fragrant and offen&s;ive &s;ub&s;tances.&mdash;It is remarkable, that mo&s;t ma|niacs and inveterate hypochondriacs, are ex|ce&s;&s;ively

fond of &s;nuff, and every thing that &s;timulates the no&s;e.</P>
<P>Of all the quadrupeds we know, the dog excels in the acutene&s;s of this &s;en&s;e; and there are many extraordinary in&s;tances record|ed of his peculiar and a&s;toni&s;hing powers of &s;mell; with one of which, as well authenti|cated as it is extraordinary, I &s;hall conclude this &s;ubject.&mdash;In the year 1582 <HI>Leonhard Zol|likofer</HI> &s;et out from his Chateau Altenklingen, in Switzerland, for Paris; the di&s;tance of which is upwards of five hundred Engli&s;h miles. A fortnight after his departure, his faithful dog, who had till then been confined, al&s;o &s;et out alone for Paris; where he ar|rived in the cour&s;e of eight days, and di&s;cov|ered his ma&s;ter in the mid&s;t of a crowd, af|ter having &s;earched for him in vain at his lodgings.</P>
<P>We are now arrived at the <HI>fifth</HI> and la&s;t of our &s;en&s;es, the <HI>Ta&s;te,</HI> which is &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed a favourite of a great number of per&s;ons, that it appears, as if they wi&s;hed to live only for the &s;ake of its gratification. I have in former parts of this work endeavoured to in|culcate the propriety and ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of attending to the effects produced on this &s;en&s;e by food and drink, without which animal life cannot be long &s;upported. In this place, therefore, there remains to be de&s;cribed only the mechani&s;m and the functions of this &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>The principal organ of ta&s;te is the tongue, which in very few animals is as &s;en&s;ible as in man. The former choo&s;e, indeed, among the
<PB N="266" REF="039111_0589_1013A3E066698EA0">
herbs upon which they feed, by accurately di&s;tingui&s;hing the u&s;eful from the noxious plants; but this appears to be more in con&s;e|quence of their acute &s;mell, than from the guidance of their ta&s;te. To de&s;cribe the fig|ure and &s;hape of the tongue, is not con&s;i&s;tent with my plan; but I &s;hall briefly ob&s;erve, that this organ is provided with innumerable nerves, which terminate in certain warts, or papillae, of a different &s;ize and figure, &s;ome of them pointed, others oblong, and others fungous.</P>
<P>The&s;e nervous papillae are the peculiar &s;eat of the &s;en&s;e of ta&s;te, or the palate. But, to ta&s;te any thing whatever, either the tongue &s;hould be moi&s;t, or the &s;ub&s;tance applied to the tongue &s;hould contain moi&s;ture. In a&s;|certaining the difference of ta&s;te, the little warts are, in &s;ome degree, dilated: every &s;ub&s;tance we can ta&s;te, contains a greater or &s;maller proportion of &s;aline and oily particles, which mu&s;t be &s;oluble by the tongue. If the &s;en&s;ation of the &s;aline particles be acrid, the ta&s;te is &s;trong, di&s;agreeable, and at length be|comes painful: this is al&s;o the ca&s;e, if the tongue, by burning or other accidents, be deprived of any part of the epidermis, or &s;carf-&s;kin.</P>
<P>Such bodies as contain no &s;aline particles, as pure water, excite no kind of ta&s;te what|ever. The difference of ta&s;te cannot be ac|counted for from the variety of figure in the cry&s;tals of the different &s;alts, but appears to ari&s;e from the chemical properties inherent in &s;aline bodies.&mdash;It may be laid down as a gen|eral
<PB N="267" REF="039111_0590_1013A3E453760E40">
rule, that every &s;ub&s;tance, which affords an agreeable ta&s;te to a healthy per&s;on of an undepraved palate, is whole&s;ome: as, on the contrary, &s;ub&s;tances of an acrid and di&s;agree|able ta&s;te are commonly pernicious.</P>
<P>The different degrees of ta&s;te depend on the greater or le&s;s &s;en&s;ibility of the nervous papillae before de&s;cribed, as well as on the quality of the &s;aliva, in a more or le&s;s healthy &s;tate of the body. If our nerves be blunted and weakened by &s;moaking tobacco, by too &s;trong and highly-&s;ea&s;oned food, by the copious u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors, by age, or other cau&s;es, we cannot rea&s;onably expect to po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame degree of &s;en&s;ibility of ta&s;te, as if we had been more attentive to the ordinances of Na|ture.&mdash;The more &s;imple our u&s;ual aliment is, the le&s;s it is &s;ea&s;oned by hot &s;pices and the le&s;s we &s;timulate the palate by wine and ardent &s;pirits, we &s;hall the better pre&s;erve our ta&s;te, together with the nerves of the tongue; and we &s;hall have a greater reli&s;h for rich di&s;hes, when they are but occa&s;ionally pre&s;ented to our palate.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;es, then, are tho&s;e organs, by means of which the mind perceives or feels external objects. They may be con&s;idered as the &s;atellites of the mind; and although &s;ome animals enjoy particular &s;en&s;es more acutely than man, yet his &s;en&s;es are more comprehen|&s;ive, and he is amply compen&s;ated by the ex|ten&s;ive u&s;e he can make of them, while the inferior creatures po&s;&s;e&s;s a more inten&s;ive ap|plication of their &s;en&s;itive faculties.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="039111_0591_1013A3E5D8AEA250">
We have now con&s;idered the mode in which the &s;en&s;es operate; we have &s;een that every thing depends upon a nervous &s;timulus, which, by the mo&s;t diver&s;ified organs, is communi|cated to the mind: there remain to be added only a few remarks and explanations, relative to animal motion, or mu&s;cular action.</P>
<P>The machine of the human body is put in motion by a great diver&s;ity of powers.&mdash;Of the&s;e, the highe&s;t and mo&s;t energetic is that of the <HI>mind;</HI> the next &s;ubordinate power is that of the <HI>nerves,</HI> immediately after which fol|lows the mo&s;t operative of the corporeal pow|ers, that is, <HI>mu&s;cular irritability,</HI> or the peculiar faculty of the mu&s;cles to contract, in con&s;e|quence of any &s;timulus applied to them. I pur|po&s;ely omit in this place, what phy&s;iologi&s;ts have called the vital power, the peculiar pow|er of life, or BLUMENBACH's <HI>vita propria;</HI> and the healing power of Nature, or <HI>vis medi|catrix naturae</HI> of the ancient phy&s;icians. All the&s;e powers are, in a great mea&s;ure, hypo|thetical, though their frequent operations in a di&s;ea&s;ed &s;tate of the body cannot be denied. And, as the mu&s;cular powers of men and ani|mals are the mo&s;t obvious to the &s;en&s;es, I &s;hall content my&s;elf with &s;tating what has a refer|ence to the&s;e.</P>
<P>A <HI>mu&s;cle</HI> is a bundle of thin and parallel plates of fle&s;hy threads or fibres. The&s;e are connected by a loo&s;e and generally fat cellular membrane; they &s;eparate into greater bundles, till at length &s;everal portions of a mu&s;cle lying parallel, or inclining towards one another, are again &s;urrounded by a tender membrane of
<PB N="269" REF="039111_0592_1013A3E880D1DE90">
a cellular texture, which forms one &s;ub&s;tance with the collateral partitions; and the&s;e, be|ing again &s;eparated from the contiguous fle&s;h, by a &s;omewhat thicker cellular texture, are then con&s;idered as one di&s;tinct mu&s;cle.</P>
<P>The human body has a con&s;iderable num|ber of mu&s;cles, yet many of the lower animals are provided with a much greater proportion of them. The caterpillar (<HI>Phalaena Co&s;&s;us,</HI> L.) has about 3500 mu&s;cles, while the human body can count &s;carcely 450. The mu&s;cles of an|imals, in general, are more powerful than tho&s;e of man. What a&s;toni&s;hing power, for in&s;tance, is the leaping chafer, or the gra&s;shopper, o|bliged to employ, in order to make jumps, which extend to &s;everal hundred times the length of their own bodies! Another &s;mall in|&s;ect, the flea, excels all other animals in its pro|digious leaps, and is able to carry a weight 80 times heavier than its body. All the&s;e appa|rent wonders are accompli&s;hed by means of the mu&s;cles. The figure of them, in man, is very irregular; tho&s;e only, which are de&s;ign|ed to perform certain <HI>valvular</HI> motions, &s;uch as the mu&s;cles of the mouth, the eye-lids, the bladder, the anus, &amp;c. are of a circular or round figure.</P>
<P>All the mu&s;cles contract in the direction of their fibres; the middle part or the belly of the mu&s;cle &s;wells, hence it gets &s;horter, and both ends approach one another. Mo&s;t of our mu&s;|cles operate in the manner of a lever; the two ends of every mu&s;cle, in the extremities of an|imals, are fa&s;tened to the bones, by means of
<PB N="270" REF="039111_0593_1013A3EA1A652FD8">
tendons or &s;inews; one of the&s;e extremities only being moveable, while the other remains fixed. Hence, in the contraction of the mu&s;|cles, the moveable bone is drawn according to the direction of their fibres. If a mu&s;cle be contracted, it nece&s;&s;arily &s;wells in thickne&s;s, as may be di&s;tinctly felt by placing the hand up|on the <HI>ma&s;&s;eter,</HI> a mu&s;cle of the lower jaw, and compre&s;&s;ing the back teeth. As &s;oon, how|ever, as the nerve of the mu&s;cle is cut, or tied only, the contracting or &s;welling power in&s;tant|ly cea&s;es, whence we are inclined to &s;uppo&s;e, that the nerves have the principal &s;hare in reg|ulating the powers of contraction, exten&s;ion, and loco-motion. Whether this be done by the influx of a fluid into the nerves, or by &s;ome other latent power, has not yet been di&s;covered.</P>
<P>The energy of mu&s;cular action is remarka|ble in every healthy individual, but particularly in very &s;trong men, and frequently too in ma|niacs. With the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a few mu&s;cles on|ly, they are enabled to rai&s;e a weight, often much exceeding that of the whole human frame.&mdash;In order to &s;upport the pre&s;&s;ure of the lever, which is accompli&s;hed with a great lo&s;s of power, and to pre&s;erve and con&s;olidate the mu&s;cles in their &s;ituation, they run at one time under cro&s;s ligaments, as is the ca&s;e on the fingers; at another time they move in rollers, for in&s;tance, in the eye; and, again, in other places, they are &s;upported in their po&s;ition by the peculiar &s;tructure of the bones, as we find on the upper part of the &s;houlders.</P>
<P>If a computation could be made of all the lo&s;&s;es of power which the mu&s;cles experience,
<PB N="271" REF="039111_0594_1013A3ECE67273F8">
partly by their frequent in&s;ertion at very acute angles, partly by their being extended as a chord, and drawing a weight oppo&s;ite to its fixed point; partly by pa&s;&s;ing over certain joints which break the force to be applied to a particular joint; and, la&s;tly, by their fle&s;hy fibres being ob&s;tructed by the angles they make with the tendons;&mdash;if all the&s;e impediments could be reduced to an accurate calculation, we &s;hould be a&s;toni&s;hed at the contractile force exerted by the mu&s;cles, as it would exceed any amount of powers rai&s;ed upon mechanical principles. It is confidently a&s;&s;erted, that the effect is &s;carcely 1/60th part of that force which the mu&s;cles employ; and yet a &s;mall number of them, the &s;ub&s;tance of which is equal in weight to a few pounds only, po&s;&s;e&s;s the power of lifting, or at lea&s;t moving, &s;everal hundred weight, and this with inconceivable facility and &s;wiftne&s;s. It would be pre&s;umptuous to a&s;cribe the great lo&s;&s;es of mu&s;cular power to any defect in the animal economy: for, if we had the full u&s;e of our mu&s;cles, the ju&s;t &s;ym|metry or proportion of the parts would be de|&s;troyed, and it might otherwi&s;e be attended with many phy&s;ical evils, the con&s;equences of which we cannot comprehend.</P>
<P>As an ample compen&s;ation for the want of this unnece&s;&s;ary &s;trength, Nature has provided the upper ends of the mu&s;cles, which bend the joints, and chiefly tho&s;e of the knees, with certain bags, <HI>bur&s;ae muco&s;ae,</HI> which contain a lubricating mucus, to facilitate the motion of the tendons. And to this beneficent arrange|ment we owe the ability of exerci&s;ing the power
<PB N="272" REF="039111_0595_1013A3F08D0DA8D8">
of the mu&s;cles with &s;uch extraordinary activ|ity, and without feeling them rigid and inflex|ible, after violent and long-continued exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>Being now acquainted, in &s;ome degree, with the <HI>nerves</HI> and <HI>mu&s;cles;</HI> it will al&s;o be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay a few words relative to the <HI>blood;</HI> e&s;pe|cially as the doctrine of <HI>temperaments,</HI> already treated of in the Introduction, was principally founded on the nature of the&s;e three &s;ub&s;tances.</P>
<P>The quantity of blood in a human body of full growth, is generally computed at 30 lb. This liquid apparently con&s;i&s;ts of two parts on|ly, namely, the <HI>&s;erum,</HI> or water, and the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ra&s;&s;amentum,</HI> or the thick and coagulable part of the blood. But, as the latter can be again &s;eparated into two parts, namely, the <HI>cruor,</HI> or the thick and red part, and the coagulable <HI>lymph,</HI> the blood con&s;equently con&s;i&s;ts of three principal con&s;tituents: the &s;erum, the cruor, and the lymph. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there is al&s;o a con&s;iderable quantity of air contained in the blood, which is, as it were, the medium of combination in all vegetable, animal, and mineral bodies; for, when the air is expelled, whether by combu&s;tion, fermentation, putre|faction, or any other proce&s;s, they ha&s;ten to|wards their inevitable di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>There is further contained in the blood, much water, a &s;mall proportion of oil, &s;ome &s;alt, earth, and a little iron, which, together with the heat produced by re&s;piration, is &s;up|po&s;ed to impart the red colour to that fluid. The red colour is confined to the <HI>cruor,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts of very minute red globules, nearly re|&s;embling in &s;hape the eggs of &s;ilk-worms.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="039111_0596_1013A3F32B0DBA80">
Much remains to be &s;aid on the properties of the blood, and its wonderful circulation in the human body; but, as this &s;ubject, from want of room, cannot be &s;atisfactorily di&s;cu&s;|&s;ed here, I am under the nece&s;&s;ity of conclu|ding this Chapter with the following remark: that the variety of temperaments in man ap|pears to be owing to the different mixture of the fluids, and the diver&s;ified &s;tructure of the &s;olids, particularly of the nerves and mu&s;cles. This is &s;o true, that the whole picture of his phy&s;ical life, together with his moral charac|ter, depend chiefly on the various combination of the&s;e parts. Yet there are different means by which peculiar temperaments are genera|ted;&mdash;the fir&s;t of the&s;e is <HI>climate,</HI> which forms the national character;&mdash;the &s;econd is a certain <HI>hereditary di&s;po&s;ition,</HI> which we derive from our parents;&mdash;and the third is the peculiar <HI>organization</HI> of the individual.</P>

<P>THERE is &s;carcely any part of the &s;en&s;itive faculties, which contributes more to our phy&s;ical enjoyments than the unimpaired power of vi&s;ion. Hence the management of the eyes de&s;erves the care and attention of every per&s;on, who wi&s;hes to pre&s;erve them in a &s;ound and perfect &s;tate, and to retard, although we can|not altogether avert, the natural con&s;equences which accompany the advance of years. By our mode of life, this infirmity is much accel|erated, and the eyes are weakened and worn out, or at lea&s;t rendered too irritable. Such is particularly the ca&s;e in tho&s;e cla&s;&s;es of peo|ple, who are much employed in &s;edentary oc|cupations, who work by candle-light, or are much expo&s;ed to du&s;t, &amp;c.</P>

The remarks, rules, and ob&s;ervations of this Chapter will relate chiefly to the treatment, both of &s;ound and weak eyes, and occa&s;ionally al&s;o to the regimen of them in a di&s;ea&s;ed &s;tate.</P>
<P>More accuracy and attention is required in this re&s;pect, than inexperienced per&s;ons gen|erally imagine. Till of late years, proper at|tention has not been paid, to lay down and e&s;|tabli&s;h well-founded and practical rules on the &s;ubject of the eyes, and their treatment. Some modern phy&s;icians and oculi&s;ts, however, have u&s;efully devoted much time and labour to in|quiries into the maladies of this organ. The fruits of the&s;e re&s;earches, as well as my own experience, on this point, I now proceed to lay before the reader.</P>

<HEAD>II. Of &s;hort-&s;ightedne&s;s, and the rever&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>MAN probably enjoys his &s;ight to a later period of life than any of the lower animals, and might pre&s;erve it &s;till longer, if he were better informed re&s;pecting its pre&s;ervation. Tho&s;e who are naturally &s;hort-&s;ighted, are en|titled to expect an improvement of vi&s;ion with the advancement of age; for their eyes then gradually begin to lo&s;e that uncommon round|ne&s;s which produces this defect, and thus to arrive at a greater enjoyment of the beauties of Nature. Per&s;ons who can &s;ee objects di&s;tinctly at a great di&s;tance only, cannot, however, be con&s;idered as le&s;s unfortunate; as they &s;tand
<PB N="276" REF="039111_0599_1013A3FAF18834D0">
in need of gla&s;&s;es, chiefly for the better di&s;|tingui&s;hing of more minute objects.</P>
<P>The nur&s;ery, or the room appropriated to the u&s;e of children, is generally the &s;malle&s;t, if not the lowe&s;t apartment in the hou&s;e; &s;o that the infant, having the opportunity to ex|erci&s;e its eyes on near objects only, often be|comes more &s;hort-&s;ighted than it is naturally. Hence children ought at lea&s;t to be frequently carried to the window, and have their eyes di|rected to a di&s;tant view. On this account, a nur&s;ery enjoying an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect is much preferable to one where the view is confined. Many per&s;ons who &s;ee well at a di&s;tance in their infancy, injure their &s;ight by reading and writing by candle-light, but particularly fe|males, by fine needle-work; as the eye is there|by too much accu&s;tomed to near and minute objects.</P>
<P>One of the bad con&s;equences of &s;hort-&s;ight|edne&s;s is, that people get into a habit of mak|ing u&s;e of one eye only. The effort of direct|ing both pupils to the object before them is attended with too much trouble; hence they look at it &s;ideways. It would be le&s;s detrimen|tal, if they were to u&s;e the eyes alternately; but here too it is equally ea&s;y to acquire a bad habit; for the eye, which is &s;pared or not ex|erci&s;ed, becomes inert and u&s;ele&s;s. Still wor&s;e is the u&s;e of a magnifying or reading gla&s;s, by which people accu&s;tom them&s;elves to &s;hut the eye then unemployed. The other, which is thus unduly exerted, &s;omewhat &s;hifts its po&s;i|tion, it becomes progre&s;&s;ively le&s;s flexible in its internal parts, and per&s;ons who take advan|tage
<PB N="277" REF="039111_0600_1013A3FD95754170">
of this temporary aid, do not find their powers of vi&s;ion improve with the advance|ment of age.</P>
<P>To prevent the&s;e bad habits, the following advice may be u&s;eful:&mdash;Children &s;u&s;pected of being &s;hort-&s;ighted, &s;hould have their eyes di|rected to an object held clo&s;e to them; and if they appear to make u&s;e of one eye only, that eye &s;hould be occa&s;ionally clo&s;ed, &s;o that they may be obliged to exerci&s;e the other. When they learn to read, they &s;hould be taught to hold the book &s;traight before their eyes; thus they will exert them&s;elves to di&s;cover the printed letters at the greate&s;t di&s;tance at which they are made to place it. The eyes, by de|grees, become accu&s;tomed to the nece&s;&s;ary in|ternal change of their po&s;ture, and the child will, in time, certainly improve in the exten|&s;ion of its &s;ight. Many per&s;ons indeed have, at a juvenile age, got rid of their &s;hort-&s;ight|edne&s;s; but there cannot be found one in|&s;tance of this improvement among tho&s;e who have, either from fa&s;hionable indulgence or nece&s;&s;ity, habituated them&s;elves to u&s;e only one eye.</P>
<P>It is to be regretted, that in &s;hort-&s;ighted individuals the brea&s;t and abdomen &s;uffer much from compre&s;&s;ion during &s;edentary oc|cupations, &s;o that they are frequently troubled with hypochondria&s;is, and, what is &s;till wor&s;e, are &s;ometimes thrown into a con&s;umption of the lungs. Though &s;tanding at intervals agrees with employments that do not require great mental exertion; yet, in the contrary

ca&s;e, it con&s;umes more &s;trength than is gen|erally imagined; and, in acute reflections, the mind ought not to be fatigued by the body. In this ca&s;e, well-cho&s;en <HI>concave &s;pectacles</HI> may be u&s;ed with advantage, &s;o that the body may be placed, while reading or writing, in the mo&s;t convenient po&s;ture: for &s;uch gla&s;&s;es will oblige the wearer to remove the object &s;ome|what farther from the eyes.</P>
<P>After &s;evere di&s;ea&s;es of the eyes, one of them frequently becomes &s;hort-&s;ighted, while the other is &s;carcely, if at all, affected. The con&s;equence is, that we employ the &s;ound eye alone, while the weak one is totally impaired by this neglect. In &s;uch a &s;ituation, we ought to u&s;e gla&s;&s;es in reading or writing, one of which &s;hould be carefully &s;elected for the &s;hort-&s;ighted eye, (according to the rules hereafter to be &s;pecified) and the other of plain, clear gla&s;s, chiefly for the &s;ake of affording an equal degree of light to both eyes. If, by this pre|caution, the weaker eye has perceptibly gained &s;trength, we may employ a le&s;s concave gla&s;s in&s;tead of that fir&s;t u&s;ed, &s;o that in time it may be &s;imilar with the other, and at length the patient be enabled to do without this a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Eyes which form too exten&s;ive a focus, re|quire no aid, unle&s;s they be extravagantly &s;o. Then, indeed, we &s;hould not he&s;itate to make u&s;e of convex gla&s;&s;es. It is, however, a vul|gar prejudice, that by &s;uch gla&s;&s;es the eye is too much indulged, and rendered &s;till more <HI>far-&s;ighted.</HI> On the contrary, it is generally improved during the u&s;e of the&s;e &s;pectacles,
<PB N="279" REF="039111_0602_1013A401CD30B968">
and, after the lap&s;e of &s;everal years, they may again be di&s;pen&s;ed with.</P>
<P>It is a con&s;olation in many di&s;ea&s;es of the eyes, that a long-continued weakne&s;s is &s;eldom the forerunner of total blindne&s;s. This fatal event generally happens by &s;udden accidents, and is &s;peedily decided.&mdash;Adults are not very &s;ubject to external complaints of the eye, or &s;uch as deprive the <HI>cornea</HI> of its tran&s;parency.</P>
<P>Small round &s;pots, hovering before the eyes like &s;trings of hollow little globules connected with one another, are defects of no great con|&s;equence, and of which, perhaps, no eye is completely free.</P>

<HEAD>III. General Rules for the Pre&s;ervation of the Eyes.</HEAD>
<P>IN all employments whatever, let us attend as much as po&s;&s;ible to this circum&s;tance, that the eyes may have an uniform and &s;ufficient light, &s;o as to affect the <HI>retina</HI> on all &s;ides alike.&mdash;The eyes materially &s;uffer, when the rays of the &s;un are &s;trongly reflected from the oppo&s;ite wall or window.</P>
<P>In children, many di&s;orders of the eye, which would never have had &s;o fatal an i&s;&s;ue, have terminated in total blindne&s;s, when pa|rents have neglected to provide the cradle or window with proper curtains. For this rea|&s;on, we ought to be extremely cautious in the choice of an apartment appropriated to the
<PB N="280" REF="039111_0603_1013A406780F74A8">
labours of the day. We &s;hould not place our&s;elves directly oppo&s;ite to the light, in reading and writing; we ought rather to take the light in a lateral direction.</P>
<P>A great ob&s;tacle to this arrangement is the change of light in the &s;ame apartment, by the progre&s;s of the &s;un. Where the &s;un dazzled in the morning, we find in the middle of the day the mo&s;t uniform light, which again in the afternoon, particularly in towns, becomes reverberatory, and extremely hurtful. This inconvenience &s;hould be remedied, if po&s;&s;ible, by a frequent change of the room; or, at lea&s;t, we might produce more uniformity in the light by means of window curtains, or blinds; and it may be ob&s;erved, that blinds of green or whited-brown linen are be&s;t adapted for this purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>It is an u&s;eful practice to protect weak eyes from the de&s;cending rays by means of &s;hades; becau&s;e the vivid light &s;triking them from above, is thus intercepted. But we ought to con&s;ider, that the lower part of the eye is by &s;uch means completely &s;haded; while the up|per part of this organ is &s;timulated by the light it receives from below;&mdash;a practice which can|not be productive of good con&s;equences. If the malady be &s;ituated in the upper part of the eye, this conduct is &s;till more improper: for the healthy part is in this manner protected, and that already relaxed is &s;till more weaken|ed.</P>
<P>Darkne&s;s, or &s;hade, is then only beneficial to the eyes, when they are unemployed, when the ob&s;curity is natural, and con&s;equently
<PB N="281" REF="039111_0604_1013A4091BF804D8">
every where extended. To re&s;t a little during the twilight, is very &s;uitable to weak eyes. No artificial darkne&s;s during the day is ever &s;o uni|form, but that the eye mu&s;t exert it&s;elf at one time more than at another, and nece&s;&s;arily &s;uffer by this change. Per&s;ons with weak or di&s;ea&s;ed eyes, who &s;pend the whole day in an apartment darkened with green curtains, injure their &s;ight &s;till more by this pernicious practice. It is far more prudent to repair to clear day-light and the fre&s;h air, and to direct the eyes to di&s;tant pro&s;pects, than to confine them to the clo&s;e atmo&s;phere of a room, and to the &s;ight of near objects.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, it is an error, that weak eyes, when employed in minute vi&s;ion, ought to have a faint light; for by this practice they are cer|tainly &s;till more weakened. Thus green &s;pec|tacles are very hurtful to &s;ome eyes, as they deprive them of that light which is nece&s;&s;ary to a di&s;tinct perception of objects.</P>

<HEAD>IV. Of the Conduct to be ob&s;erved in Weak Eyes.</HEAD>
<P>THE artificial light of candles and lamps is detrimental to weak eyes; not, as &s;ome imag|ine, on account of the light being too &s;trong for the eyes, but becau&s;e the flame of a candle too powerfully illumines the eye in one point, and does not uniformly &s;timulate the <HI>retina.</HI></P>
<P>The means u&s;ed to prevent the great &s;timu|lus from the rays of light are, in general, &s;o
<PB N="282" REF="039111_0605_1013A40ADA7F2C30">
regulated, that the &s;creen may not only cover the flame, but al&s;o concentrate the greate&s;t part of the light. Thus the room is darkened, and only a &s;mall &s;pot above and below the ap|paratus is illumined; a practice highly inju|dicious. The &s;tudy lamps, with large round &s;creens, &s;eem to be purpo&s;ely contrived to im|pair the &s;ounde&s;t eyes, by their continued u&s;e.&mdash;The green parchment &s;creens formerly u&s;ed were likewi&s;e objectionable; for, though they admitted the free acce&s;s of light on both &s;ides, yet they produced too great a &s;hade before the eyes. The be&s;t and mo&s;t proper defence of weak eyes by candle-light is a flat &s;creen, projecting about two or three inches over the forehead; or even a round hat, with a brim of a proper &s;ize.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are afflicted with weak eyes &s;hould always make u&s;e of two candles, placed &s;o that their flame be neither too low, nor too high for the eye. This is a circum&s;tance of great importance, as the light, when placed too low, is uncommonly &s;timulating and fa|tiguing. Candles have this advantage over lamps, that their light is le&s;s offen&s;ive to the eye and le&s;s pernicious to the lungs; as they do not, in general, emit &s;o much &s;moke. But, on the other hand, all candles have the follow|ing di&s;advantages: 1. that, by their burn|ing downwards, the fatigued eye is progre&s;|&s;ively more &s;trained in the later hours of can|dle-light; 2. that the unequal light they give is attended with the additional trouble of &s;nuffing them; and, 3. that by the lea&s;t com|motion of the air, or, if made of bad materials,
<PB N="283" REF="039111_0606_1013A40ED91AE140">
they offend the eye by their flaring light.&mdash;Hence a clear chamber-lamp, burning with the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible &s;moke and &s;mell, is far prefera|ble and more &s;oothing to the eye, than even wax-candles. Some of the lately-improved Patent-lamps, originally contrived by M. D' ARGENT, in Switzerland, are well calculated to an&s;wer every u&s;eful purpo&s;e; but, in&s;tead of the common round &s;creens, I would re|commend another, immediately to be de|&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e <HI>&s;creens</HI> are the be&s;t, which are appli|ed to one &s;ide of the light only, which are not larger than is nece&s;&s;ary to cover the flame, and which &s;till admit a &s;mall quantity of light to pa&s;s through them. This is obtained by a &s;imple contrivance of taffety, &s;lightly gummed, and folded &s;o that it can be carried about in the pocket. The&s;e little &s;creens are very con|venient in travelling, and are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the e&s;&s;ential advantage, that they over&s;hade only the &s;mall angle formed for the individual who is affected with weak eyes, without depriving the re&s;t of the company of light. In the day|time, on the occa&s;ion of &s;ealing letters, for in&s;tance, the light of a candle or taper is more prejudicial to the eye than in the evening.</P>
<P>In the morning we &s;hould not too much exert the eyes immediately after ri&s;ing. Hence it is advi&s;eable to remove the candle to &s;ome di&s;tance and under &s;hade in the long winter mornings, till the eye be gradually accu&s;tom|ed to it. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, the window-&s;hutters ought not to be &s;uddenly opened in very bright day-light. This immediate change,
<PB N="284" REF="039111_0607_1013A4105E0C7D58">
from darkne&s;s to the cleare&s;t light, occa&s;ions &s;en&s;ible pain even to the &s;tronge&s;t eye.</P>
<P>Writing fatigues the eyes le&s;s than reading; for the letters we form on paper are pre|viou&s;ly imprinted on the imagination, and con&s;equently require much le&s;s acutene&s;s of &s;ight, than the &s;eries of letters and words we read. It is, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, much ea&s;ier to the eye to read our own hand-writing, than that of a &s;tranger, however di&s;tinct. Be&s;ides, the letters and lines in writing are more di&s;tingui&s;hable by the lower part of the blank paper, than the lines in a printed book, or on a manu&s;cript; in both of which they appear to flow together, and can be kept a&s;un|der only by great exertion of the eye. The ca&s;e is con&s;iderably changed, when we en|deavour to write remarkably well; when we make u&s;e of a glo&s;&s;y white paper, and particu|larly when we copy the writing of another per&s;on with great accuracy&mdash;in all which in&s;tances the &s;ight is more impaired than in reading, e&s;pecially by changing the direction of the eyes too frequently to papers, or books of different types.</P>
<P>The extravagant elegance in the letter-pre&s;s of many modern books, the &s;plendid whitene&s;s and &s;moothne&s;s of vellum paper, or of hot-pre&s;&s;ed woven paper, and the broad margin injudiciou&s;ly contra&s;ted with the printer's glo&s;&s;y ink, are ill calculated to pre&s;erve our eyes. And if the lines be too clo&s;e to each other, the columns too long, as in our new&s;|papers, the ink too pale, as is now becoming fa&s;hionable, and the paper of a blui&s;h ca&s;t&mdash;
<PB N="285" REF="039111_0608_1013A412EDD761D0">
the eyes are then in a fair way of being total|ly blinded.</P>
<P>I read in the <HI>Gentleman's Magazine</HI> for April, 1794, a propo&s;al, to print on dark blue paper with white letters, or on green pa|per with yellow letters. This plan certain|ly de&s;erves a fair trial, though it might meet with great difficulties in the execution.&mdash;The eyes would al&s;o be greatly pre&s;erved, by mak|ing u&s;e of a fine light blue writing-paper, rather of a greeni&s;h tint, in&s;tead of the fa&s;h|ionable white or cream-coloured paper.</P>
<P>Every exertion of the eyes is mo&s;t hurtful immediately after a meal, as well as at any time when the blood is in great agitation.&mdash;In the dawn, in twilight, and in moon&s;hine, we ought not to read or write, nor direct our &s;ight too attentively to objects.</P>
<P><HI>Refracted rays</HI> afford an unplea&s;ant light, and oblique rays are particularly painful. When we take exerci&s;e in a long, irregularly-lighted apartment; we feel &s;en&s;ible vibrations in the pupil of the eye. The mo&s;t &s;uitable apartment, in this re&s;pect, is one forming a regular &s;quare, with large windows to the ea&s;t, in which there is an uniformly-divided light, or &s;till better by means of &s;ky-lights. Garret windows afford a bad light; it being general|ly introduced, as it were, by a funnel, and il|lumining only one part of the room, while the re&s;t remains dark.</P>
<P>A &s;itting-room is be&s;t adapted to pre&s;erve the eyes, the walls of which are pale green, without paintings; two or three uniformly high windows, &s;o as to give an equal light; (yet &s;o contrived as to prevent its being too
<PB N="286" REF="039111_0609_1013A4148965F9B0">
&s;trong) clo&s;e and moveable green blinds; a green carpet on the floor; and, la&s;tly, &s;uch &s;hutters as may occa&s;ionally leave the upper part of the window uncovered, in order to admit &s;ufficient light&mdash;To &s;it with the back to the window, occa&s;ions a &s;hade which forms a di&s;agreeable contra&s;t to the &s;urrounding light. The writing-de&s;k, therefore, ought to be placed &s;o, that the la&s;t window may be on the left hand, and that the right hand may throw no &s;hade on the paper, and not too near a corner of the room, as this generally has an unfavour|able light. A &s;pace &s;ufficiently broad, between two windows, is a &s;till more convenient &s;itua|tion for a de&s;k; but we &s;hould not &s;it too near the wall; a cu&s;tom which is exce&s;&s;ively hurtful to the eyes.</P>
<P>An oblique po&s;ition of the de&s;k is the mo&s;t proper; for it pre&s;ents to us the writing ma|terials in that po&s;ition, in which we are habit|uated to place a book, when we hold it in our hands, and from which the rays of light di|verge more gradually than from a horizontal table. It is le&s;s hurtful to the brea&s;t, to the abdomen, and al&s;o to the eyes, to u&s;e a de&s;k of this form, and to write &s;tanding rather than &s;itting; provided that the height of the de&s;k be proportionate to the length of the body, that it &s;tand firm, and that both arms re&s;t upon it, without being fatigued by rai&s;ing them too high&mdash;In <HI>&s;tanding</HI> before a de&s;k, we have this additional advantage, that there is le&s;s occa&s;ion to direct the eyes upwards, than in &s;itting. Hence the conver&s;ation between tall per&s;ons and tho&s;e of a low &s;tature is mo&s;t
<PB N="287" REF="039111_0610_1013A417171B63D8">
trouble&s;ome to the latter, as they are con&s;tant|ly obliged to look upwards.&mdash;Tho&s;e with whom we conver&s;e ought not to &s;tand between our body and the light, as it is both rude, and prejudicial to our eyes.</P>
<P>At night we ought to place the candle &s;o that we may receive light from it in the &s;ame direction as we do from the window in the day-time. Even if it be provided with a green &s;creen, as before de&s;cribed, a weak eye will not long be able to &s;upport its glare in a &s;traight line. Were the candle to be elevated at our back, &s;o as to allow the light to come down over our &s;houlders, we &s;hould then ex|perience the &s;ame inconvenience, which at|tends that po&s;ture in day-light. Hence it is nece&s;&s;ary to place it &s;ideways, and to keep the book or paper in a lateral direction.</P>
<P>We &s;hould not expo&s;e our&s;elves in a &s;traight direction to objects &s;trongly illumined by the flame of a candle, or fire from a grate. Thus the highly-poli&s;hed &s;enders and other fire-irons are injurious to &s;ight; and not le&s;s &s;o is a &s;mooth and &s;hining wax-cloth over a table, as refracting too much the rays of light: a green cloth is preferable. In all ca&s;es, the light &s;hould at lea&s;t be of equal height with the fore|head; not clo&s;e to a white wall, and &s;till le&s;s before a looking-gla&s;s or other poli&s;hed body. To walk up and down a room lighted with a &s;ingle candle, &s;o that at one time we have the light full in our eye, and at another are nearly in darkne&s;s, is very prejudicial to weak eyes. It is better to place the candle in the middle of the room, in order to illumine it more uni|formly,
<PB N="288" REF="039111_0611_1013A41ACD82A228">
or, what is &s;till preferable, to hang it higher than the &s;hade of our own body.</P>
<P>Where per&s;ons mu&s;t have a light during the night, it ought to be placed in the next room, or at lea&s;t within the chimney, that it may be entirely out of &s;ight. If neither of the&s;e methods be convenient, we &s;hould place it be|hind or at the &s;ide of the bed, rather than in an oppo&s;ite direction. For, if this be not at|tended to, the light may produce very noxious effects during &s;leep, even through the clo&s;ed eye-lids. The &s;ame attention is required, to prevent the rays of the &s;un or moon, either directly or by reflection from the oppo&s;ite wall, from &s;triking the eyes of the per&s;on a&s;leep.&mdash;As &s;ome men are known to &s;leep with their eyes open, it would be advi&s;able to employ &s;omebody to &s;hut them, that they may not &s;uffer by the accidents before mentioned.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have weak eyes &s;hould carefully avoid &s;trong fires and even hot rooms; for heat &s;till more dries the eyes already &s;uffering from want of moi&s;ture. Indeed, it is highly probable, that the weakne&s;s of &s;ight and early blindne&s;s, &s;o common in this country, are in a great mea&s;ure owing to the bad cu&s;tom of ha&s;tening to the fire-&s;ide, whether coming from the cold air, or from the dark &s;treets.</P>
<P>Weak eyes mu&s;t be indulged with &s;hady places, and protected again&s;t every dazzling object. But green arbours &s;hould be avoided, on account of the twinkling light occa&s;ioned by the agitation of the leaves. The exerci&s;e of the eyes ought never to be &s;u&s;pended for any con&s;iderable length of time: too much re&s;t
<PB N="289" REF="039111_0612_1013A41E6359DDA0">
is hurtful; and to &s;it whole hours of the eve|ning without candle-light, is extremely perni|cious. It is, however, very &s;oothing to the eyes, to let them re&s;t for half an hour during twilight. This &s;hould teach us to adopt the general and &s;alutary rule, to ri&s;e with the dawn, and gradually to accu&s;tom our&s;elves to the artificial light of the evening. For a &s;im|ilar rea&s;on, tho&s;e who complain of weakne&s;s of &s;ight, ought not to re&s;ort to places artificial|ly lighted in the day-time, &s;uch as theatres, &amp;c. Even the &s;ounde&s;t eyes mu&s;t inevitably &s;uffer by a &s;udden change from light to darkne&s;s, or from darkne&s;s to &s;trong light.</P>
<P>If it become nece&s;&s;ary to let the eyes re&s;t, we &s;hould by no means pre&s;s the eye-lids too clo&s;ely together, which if long continued, is very hurtful. So is &s;trong and frequent fric|tion, which powerfully &s;timulates the nerves and injures the eyes. If we &s;it for any length of time with clo&s;ed eyes, we are ea&s;ily overta|ken by &s;leep, which, though beneficial, ought to be of &s;hort duration, that the eyes may not be overheated. As a protection again&s;t inju|ry from external cau&s;es, it is mo&s;t u&s;eful to wear a &s;hade at &s;uch a di&s;tance, as may allow the ey<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> free motion, and not keep it too warm. The green veils worn by ladies are, in this re&s;|pect, well calculated to prevent the du&s;t from entering the eye, as well as to protect it again&s;t cold winds, and the burning rays of the &s;un.</P>
<P>The common eye-ca&s;es, u&s;ed by travellers, and by artificers who work in &s;ub&s;tances a|bounding with du&s;t, are, for the following rea|&s;ons,
<PB N="290" REF="039111_0613_1013A41FEDF83810">
improper: 1. the gla&s;s in the ca&s;e &s;tands too prominent, and dimini&s;hes the horizon; hence, as tho&s;e who wear them cannot &s;ee &s;ideways and downward, but only &s;traight for|ward, they travel un&s;afely on an uneven road; 2. the gla&s;s in the&s;e ca&s;es being ea&s;ily covered with vapour, both from internal per&s;piration and external cold, prevents di&s;tinct vi&s;ion. The&s;e eye-ca&s;es might be much improved by making the brim &s;omewhat narrower, and &s;ub&s;tituting a fine &s;ilken gauze, or rather a thin plate of ivory, dyed green, with a &s;mall horizontal inci&s;ion, in preference to gla&s;s.</P>
<P>All gla&s;&s;es u&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t vi&s;ion appear to re|quire &s;ome effort of the eyes, and, unle&s;s they be indi&s;pen&s;able, they &s;hould never be employ|ed by per&s;ons at an early time of life. In proof of this a&s;&s;ertion, I &s;hall only remark, that by looking through a window of the fine&s;t gla&s;s, we feel our eyes much more fatigued, than if the window had been open. This is particu|larly the ca&s;e in locking through coach-win|dows, where additional injury is occa&s;ioned to the eyes, by the motion of the carriage, and the impure air ari&s;ing from re&s;piration. Green curtains in coaches are, therefore, judicious and proper.</P>
<P>Of all the remedies for pre&s;erving weak eyes (for di&s;ea&s;ed eyes require profe&s;&s;ional a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance,) bathing them in pure cold water is the mo&s;t refre&s;hing and &s;trengthening. But this ought not to be done above three or four times a day; otherwi&s;e it has a tendency to give an unnece&s;&s;ary &s;timulus to the eyes. Nor &s;hould it be done immediately after ri&s;ing in the morn+ing,
<PB N="291" REF="039111_0614_1013A4228715EB48">
but only when the moi&s;ture, which dur|ing &s;leep is depo&s;ited even in the &s;ounde&s;t eyes, is nearly evaporated. This partial cold bath may be repeated after dinner and &s;upper, at which times the eyes &s;tand as much in need of it as in the morning. Not only the eyes, but al&s;o the brow, the region behind the ears, &s;ometimes the whole head, and particularly the upper lip, which is clo&s;ely connected with the optic nerves, &s;hould be bathed or wa&s;hed as well as the eyes. In the morning, the eye ought not to be precipitately, but gradually expo&s;ed to the water: and the wa&s;hing &s;hould be expeditiou&s;ly performed. In drying or wiping the eye, we &s;hould proceed gently and with caution; and immediately after wa&s;hing, we &s;hould particularly guard again&s;t any rays of light, as well as every kind of exertion.</P>
<P>A large piece of &s;ponge, containing a good deal of water, &s;o that it may not too &s;oon be|come warm, is far preferable in the&s;e partial bathings, to the warm, &s;mooth hand, or towel. The &s;ponge &s;hould be frequently dipped into cold water, and occa&s;ionally allowed to lie for a few moments on the eye, with the head bent backward while the eye is generally moved and a little opened during the operation.</P>
<P>The bathing of the eyes, in &s;mall gla&s;&s;es, is le&s;s advantageous, as the water very &s;oon turns luke-warm, and is perhaps too cold, when &s;ud|denly renewed.

The cold bath, under certain re&s;trictions, is u&s;eful; as it invigorates the whole body, and con&s;equently &s;trengthens the eyes; but in &s;ome ca&s;es it may injure them, by propelling the blood too forcibly to the head. This may, in a great mea&s;ure, be prevented by not only wa&s;hing the eyes and the whole head previ|ou&s;ly to entering the bath, but al&s;o by diving the whole face and head under water.</P>

<HEAD>V. Dietetical Precepts re&s;pecting the Eyes in general.</HEAD>
<P>ABOVE all things, we mu&s;t ob&s;erve the old rule; to try carefully what be&s;t agrees with us, and to attend to moderation and regular|ity in our manner of living.</P>
<P>Smoking tobacco, and taking &s;nuff, are in|jurious; as by either practice the eye is too much &s;timulated. It is a vulgar error, that people cannot re&s;ign the&s;e improper habits, without injury to their health. They may be &s;afely abandoned at once, though occa&s;ionally pre&s;cribed as medicines.&mdash;Tobacco<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The tobacco&punc;plant was fir&s;t di&s;covered growing wild in South-America; in the year 1496 it was al&s;o found in Saint Domingo; in 1520 in Jucatan; from which la&s;t place the fir&s;t &s;eeds were brought over to Portugal in 1560, by the French Amba&s;&s;ador <HI>Nicot,</HI> who gave it its pre&s;ent name from the I&s;land of <HI>Tobago,</HI> where it grew in great abundance.

u&s;ed as a luxury. This plant is now much abu&s;ed; and tho&s;e who are once accu&s;tomed to it, cannot leave it off without great re&s;olu|tion. To &s;uch per&s;ons it does not afford relief as a medicine; their olfactory nerves having become almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible to its &s;timulus. As a medicinal remedy, it &s;erves to draw &s;uperflu|ous humours from the head; but in tho&s;e who u&s;e it extravagantly, e&s;pecially in &s;nuff, it imperceptibly weakens the nervous &s;y&s;tem, and e&s;pecially the memory.</P>
<P>After meals, and the above-&s;tated bathings, it is beneficial to the eyes to remain in the open air, to direct our looks to a gra&s;s-plat, or to divert them with &s;ome amu&s;ing employ|ment.&mdash;Some have ob&s;erved, that their eyes are not &s;o &s;trong after they have eaten weak &s;oups or broths, as after &s;olid food: they further affirm, that their &s;ight is &s;tronger after a meal con&s;i&s;ting entirely of vegetable aliment, than after a very moderate portion of animal food. The&s;e ob&s;ervations are far from being unimportant, and, if fully confirmed by ex|perience, they may throw &s;ome light on the dietetical treatment of the eyes&mdash;a branch of medicine that has hitherto been too much neg|lected.</P>
<P>A &s;hort &s;leep after dinner can only be bene|ficial to the eyes of tho&s;e, with whom this practice does not di&s;agree; at all events, the eyes ought to be protected from day-light, which would hurt them more than they can be refre&s;hed by a &s;hort &s;lumber.&mdash;The particu|lar rules re&s;pecting this practice, I have &s;tated
<PB N="294" REF="039111_0617_1013A42B62D59658">
in the Seventh Chapter.&mdash;The &s;team of boiled coffee, gently applied, has al&s;o been recom|mended after dinner to per&s;ons afflicted with weak eyes; but nothing has a more &s;alutary tendency, in this re&s;pect, than to go to bed at an early hour; for mo&s;t people impair their &s;ight by heavy &s;uppers and heating liquors, &s;o that their eyes remain inflamed till next day. The &s;ame, indeed, is al&s;o the ca&s;e with tho&s;e who indulge too much in &s;leep.</P>
<P>A pure, &s;erene air is an e&s;&s;ential requi&s;ite to the pre&s;ervation of the eyes. Fetid exhalations &s;ometimes in&s;tantaneou&s;ly affect the eye; hence we &s;hould avoid the putrid effluvia from mar&s;hes and ditches, or other places in which the air is filled with noxious vapours; for in&s;tance, the vicinity of colour-&s;hops, hart&s;horn-di&s;til|leries, and the like. It is, perhaps, unnece&s;|&s;ary to point out every &s;pecies of mephitic va|pours to be &s;hunned as the enemies of &s;ight; yet it de&s;erves to be remarked, that the exha|lations of &s;tables are injurious, while the &s;talls, and other places where cattle are kept, are far le&s;s hurtful. La&s;tly, the galleries of churches, as well as the higher boxes and galleries of playhou&s;es, are mo&s;t pernicious places; for the exhalations, a&s;cending from a great num|ber of people a&s;&s;embled below, are extremely detrimental to &s;ight.</P>
<P>On the other hand, the frequent enjoyment of a pure and fre&s;h air, the occa&s;ional re&s;ort to elevated &s;ituations, nay, even the expo&s;ure to a moderate wind, are means of improvement. The more vigorous &s;pecies of bodily exerci&s;e al&s;o, are in a certain degree u&s;eful; provided

we do not exert the eye by reading, writing, &amp;c. before the circulating fluids are reduced to their proper medium.&mdash;The application of electricity, which has benefited many weak eyes, by its fluid being conducted through a wooden point, is &s;omewhat analogous to the going and &s;tanding again&s;t the wind; as it probably operates more by the gentle vibrations of the air, than by the communication of the electric fluid it&s;elf.</P>
<P>To read in the open air is hurtful to &s;ound, and &s;till more to weak eyes, unle&s;s the light of a clear day be modified at lea&s;t by the foliage of a tree from above; yet even here the vivid light &s;urrounding the book is fatiguing.</P>
<P>The greater or le&s;s intere&s;t we take in our employments, is of con&s;iderable importance to the organs of &s;ight; particularly if they be in a weak &s;tate. The more alluring a book or any other amu&s;ement is, the longer we are in|duced to continue it. Hence the important rule: to re&s;erve the mo&s;t intere&s;ting labours for the half-wearied eyes; yet, with prudent &s;everity, always to appoint a ta&s;k; for, with|out this precaution, the &s;ight, though at a later period, will inevitably experience more or le&s;s injury from &s;uch practices.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of the weather has great influence on the power of vi&s;ion; hence per&s;ons troubled with weak eyes &s;hould not be alarmed, if in a tempe&s;t or thunder-&s;torm, in rainy, or foggy weather, their &s;ight be le&s;s acute, or even much impaired.&mdash;Such individuals are ea&s;ily affected by &s;tanding too long on cold or damp ground, by a too light dre&s;s, and particularly by a too thin covering of the legs and feet.</P>

Riding on hor&s;eback is beneficial to weak eyes, as is al&s;o walking and riding in carriages. The principal advantage in all the&s;e exerci&s;es is, perhaps, derived from employing the eye with a great variety of objects, none of which occupies the attention too long.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, per&s;ons having black eye-la&s;hes gen|erally po&s;&s;e&s;s greater powers of vi&s;ion, than tho&s;e who&s;e eye-la&s;hes are of a light colour; be|cau&s;e the former are a better &s;creen for the eye, and reflect no light from their out&s;ide, by which the image on the retina would be ren|dered weaker and more indi&s;tinct.</P>
<P>MONTALDUS gives an account of a per&s;on who&s;e eye-lids and eye-la&s;hes were completely white; who con&s;equently &s;aw but indifferent|ly in the day-time, but much better in the evening and at night. This man happened to be taken pri&s;oner by the Moors, who dyed his eye-lids black, by which his &s;ight was much improved: but, as &s;oon as the colour was lo&s;t, his vi&s;ion al&s;o became weaker.</P>
<P>Dr. RUSSELL mentions, in his "<HI>Hi&s;tory of Aleppo,</HI>" that the Turki&s;h ladies u&s;ually dye the inner &s;ide of their eye-lids black, not &s;o much for the &s;ake of ornament, as with a view to &s;trengthen their &s;ight.&mdash;It has farther been ob&s;erved, that when we lo&s;e the eye-la&s;h|es, as is often the ca&s;e in the &s;mall-pox, the &s;en&s;e of vi&s;ion is thereby con&s;iderably weaken|ed. For a &s;imilar rea&s;on, the hair combed down the forehead, if of a dark colour, will a&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;ight, as well as any other contriv|ance over the brow.</P>

<HEAD>VI. Some additional Rules, addre&s;&s;ed to tho&s;e who are obliged to make u&s;e of Eye-gla&s;&s;es.</HEAD>
<P>THE ca&s;es in which eye-gla&s;&s;es may be u&s;ed with advantage, are nearly the following: 1. when we are obliged to hold &s;mall objects at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, before we can di&s;tin|gui&s;h them: 2. when, in order to di&s;cern ob|jects, we require more light than u&s;ual; for in&s;tance, when we are obliged to place a can|dle between the eye and the object; for this is one of the mo&s;t de&s;tructive practices, by which the optic nerves and mu&s;cles are much injured;&mdash;and, as the eye employs it&s;elf with the object in proportion to the degree of light reflected upon it, the pupil ought to dilate accordingly; in&s;tead of which, it is forced to contract, on account of the too powerful light produced by the intermediate candle: 3. when a near object, upon accurate and attentive ex|amination, becomes ob&s;cure, and begins to appear covered, as it were, with a mi&s;t or fog: 4. when, in reading or writing, the letters &s;eem to flow into one another, and look as if they were double or treble: 5. when the eyes are ea&s;ily fatigued, and we are obliged from time to time to &s;hut them, or to direct them to fre&s;h objects, for temporary relief.</P>
<P>In the choice of &s;pectacles we need not at|tend &s;o much to their magnifying power, as to the circum&s;tance of their agreeing with our &s;ight; that is, when they enable us, clearly and without exertion, to &s;ee at the &s;ame di&s;|tance, in which we formerly were accu&s;tom|ed to read or work. Hence we ought out of
<PB N="298" REF="039111_0621_1013A43288DA7EA8">
a number of gla&s;&s;es to choo&s;e tho&s;e, which afford the be&s;t and cleare&s;t light in every &s;tate of the eye. But, if a per&s;on be &s;hort-&s;ighted, he &s;hould choo&s;e a &s;econd gla&s;s, magnifying a little more than the other, but &s;omewhat le&s;s di&s;tinct, yet &s;o that it may not ob&s;cure the ob|ject. This is unplea&s;ant at fir&s;t, but the eyes in time become accu&s;tomed to it, and daily im|prove. If, after &s;ome time, we make u&s;e of le&s;s concave gla&s;&s;es, there is no doubt, that in the cour&s;e of a few years, according to partic|ular circum&s;tances, the defect of &s;hort-&s;ight|edne&s;s may be gradually removed.</P>
<P>He who ob&s;erves this regular gradation with his &s;pectacles, may pre&s;erve his eyes to the late&s;t period of life. But we &s;hould not make the&s;e changes too &s;uddenly, le&s;t the aid of art be too &s;oon exhau&s;ted, and the wearer of gla&s;&s;es perhaps be unable to find any of &s;ufficient magnifying powers. It is farther a hurtful practice, to u&s;e any other but our own gla&s;&s;es, to which the eye has been accu&s;tomed;&mdash;every irregularity is injurious, and the pre&s;|ervation of the eyes depends chiefly on uni|formity, with re&s;pect to gla&s;&s;es as well as to the light, in which the organs of &s;ight are exerci&s;ed.</P>
<P>In u&s;ing one gla&s;s only, people accu&s;tom them&s;elves to neglect one of the eyes; and, on this account, &s;pectacles are preferable. Yet both gla&s;&s;es mu&s;t be &s;eparately fitted to each eye, and by no means indi&s;criminately u&s;ed; for this would increa&s;e the di&s;ea&s;e.&mdash;If, how|ever we make u&s;e of one gla&s;s only, each of the eyes ought alternately to be habituated to it.</P>
<P>Many per&s;ons wear gla&s;&s;es in the evening, and can di&s;pen&s;e with them in day-light. This
<PB N="299" REF="039111_0622_1013A4396796B078">
is rather an imprudent practice; and, if it be not too late, they &s;hould choo&s;e a &s;econd pair of gla&s;&s;es, &s;omewhat more magnifying, and to be u&s;ed by candle-light only. In this man|ner, the retina would receive an equal propor|tion of light, at one time as well as another, and the eye longer pre&s;erve its vigour.</P>
<P><HI>Green gla&s;&s;es</HI> are &s;aid to be mo&s;t &s;uitable to the eye, &s;ince they modify the impre&s;&s;ion of light on the retina. Though this be in a great mea&s;ure true, they cannot be indi&s;criminately recommended, and certainly not to &s;uch as have weak eyes. Green is indeed plea&s;ing to the eye, more than any other colour, but, at the &s;ame time, it &s;omewhat ob&s;cures objects, e&s;pecially at fir&s;t. Tho&s;e of a vigorous &s;ight only &s;hould make u&s;e of them as pre&s;ervatives, e&s;pecially again&s;t the fire or candle-light. But, if white or light-coloured objects appear red, after having u&s;ed green gla&s;&s;es for a &s;hort time, we &s;hould di&s;continue their u&s;e; as this phe|nomenon is a certain proof, that they will in the end de&s;troy the eyes. If the green colour does not in two or three days become imper|ceptible, but appears con&s;tantly upon the pa|per as it did at fir&s;t, it is a farther criterion that the u&s;e of them is improper.</P>
<P>Many give the preference to large reading-gla&s;&s;es; in order to avoid wearing &s;pectacles. It is however obvious, that it mu&s;t be a per|nicious practice, to keep the eyes in con&s;tant exertion, as is the ca&s;e here, where every mo|tion of the hand and the head nece&s;&s;arily al|ters the di&s;tance. In addition to this inconve|nience, the dazzling &s;plendour of the rays, reflected from the &s;urface of the gla&s;s, weak|ens
<PB N="300" REF="039111_0623_1013A43AECDF4630">
the eye to &s;uch a degree, as to render the u&s;e of &s;pectacles ultimately indi&s;pen&s;able, with this only difference, that the eyes require greater magnifying powers, than might have been nece&s;&s;ary without this depravation.</P>
<P>Hence &s;pectacles are in every re&s;pect pref|erable, as they are not only more conformable to the nature and mechani&s;m of the eye, but al&s;o more convenient: they are uniformly placed before the objects by the imperceptible motion of the head; they leave the &s;pace be|tween the object and the eyes open and free; and being generally thinner, and lying at an uniform di&s;tance before the eye, they pre&s;ent the objects more clearly and di&s;tinctly than reading-gla&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have weak eyes, ought not to employ them&s;elves, even occa&s;ionally, in a manner that may be fatiguing to the &s;ight. Particularly hurtful are tho&s;e occupations, in which one eye only is exerted, and mu&s;t con|&s;equently be placed in po&s;itions, different from tho&s;e of the other eye, which is at re&s;t. For this rea&s;on, the u&s;e of magnifying gla&s;&s;es, of whatever kind, is more pernicious to weak eyes, if we always u&s;e the &s;ame eye and pur|po&s;ely &s;hut the other, than if we alternately make u&s;e of either. On this account, micro|&s;copical inve&s;tigations are le&s;s hurtful, if, while one eye be employed, we can keep the other open.</P>
<P>We &s;hould not make too frequent trials to di&s;cover, whether we have improved in &s;ight, or not; for the exertion nece&s;&s;ary upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, is uncommonly &s;timulating and fatiguing</P>
<P><PB N="301" REF="039111_0624_1013A43C8C4CBA38">
Spectacles ought to be u&s;ed only for the pur|po&s;es for which they are de&s;igned; namely, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;uch employments as require the a&s;&s;i&s;tance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> art, and where the eye is always kept at an equal di&s;tance; for in&s;tance, in reading or writing. We &s;hould not without a full trial make choice of a pair of gla&s;&s;es, nor be &s;atis|fied with tho&s;e which, at fir&s;t, exhibit the ob|jects clearly and di&s;tinctly. For objects will not always be at the &s;ame di&s;tance before us as they appear at the fir&s;t experiment. It would be proper to try a pair of gla&s;&s;es for a &s;hort time, e&s;pecially by candle-light; to u&s;e them in that po&s;ture of the body to which we are accu&s;tomed; and, if with the u&s;ual kind of labour, we do not feel our eyes fatigued, but rather &s;omewhat relieved, we then ought to adopt the&s;e gla&s;&s;es. But, as it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to meet with a pair of gla&s;&s;es in the &s;hops, which fit both eyes, there is nothing more ab&s;urd, than to purcha&s;e &s;pectacles ready made. Certain as it is, it may not be gener|ally known, that there is perhaps not one per|&s;on among thou&s;ands, who&s;e eyes are both of an equal &s;ize and con&s;titution. For this rea|&s;on, different eyes &s;hould be accommodated with different gla&s;&s;es; and, if we con&s;ult our intere&s;t in an affair of &s;uch con&s;equence, we &s;hall be cautious in &s;electing for each eye a proper gla&s;s.

<P>Short &s;ighted per&s;ons, who wi&s;h for a prop|er concave or magnifying gla&s;s, may take the exact focus, or point of vi&s;ion, by pre&s;enting the &s;malle&s;t print very clo&s;e to the eye, and
<PB N="302" REF="039111_0625_1013A43E10A75228">
gradually removing it, as far as they can read the letters di&s;tinctly, and without much ex|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">on. When they have accurately a&s;cer|tained the focus, after frequent trials, let them employ another per&s;on to take the mea&s;ure of this di&s;tance, with a &s;lip of paper, in the ni|ce&s;t po&s;&s;ible manner. An optician, on re|ceiving this mea&s;ure, and being informed at what di&s;tance the gla&s;&s;es are intended to be u&s;ed, will be able to judge, in a certain degree, although by no means &s;o accurately as by a per|&s;onal conference with the &s;hort-&s;ighted per&s;on.</P>
<P>Such as ob&s;erve their eyes to be inclined to far-&s;ightedne&s;s, may proceed exactly in a &s;im|ilar manner. But all eye-gla&s;&s;es ought to be furni&s;hed with double joints or &s;prings; as tho&s;e with &s;ingle joints are not only inconve|nient on the no&s;e, but what is wor&s;e, they are apt to &s;hift the point of vi&s;ion with every motion of the head, and con&s;equently injure the eyes.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, in &s;uch occupations as require a more or le&s;s extended view of the objects, for in&s;tance, in playing at cards, where the di&s;|tance of the objects mu&s;t be frequently varied, it would be extremely injudicious to u&s;e &s;pec|tacles; as no eye whatever can bear &s;uch ex|ertions, without uncommon fatigue. For a &s;imilar rea&s;on, it is hurtful to the&s;e important organs, to keep the &s;pectacles on the head at clo&s;e work, when by &s;ome accident we are obliged to &s;earch for &s;omething dropt, or mi&s;|laid. Thus we force the eye to make uncom|mon efforts, in &s;eeing farther than it is ena|bled to do, by the con&s;truction of the &s;pecta|cles.

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>THE preceding Chapters contain the prin|cipal outlines, relative to the treatment of the human body in a healthy &s;tate, &s;o far as the limits of this work would admit, without tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing too much on the indulgence of the reader.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude with a few general reflec|tions, and recapitulate, in a conci&s;e manner, &s;everal u&s;eful precepts, which have been more fully laid down in former parts of this work.</P>
<P><HI>Moderation,</HI> in every re&s;pect ought to be the fir&s;t and leading maxim of tho&s;e who wi&s;h to live long and enjoy health. Extremes, in the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite things, frequently border on each other. The greate&s;t joy may occa&s;ion the mo&s;t acute pain; and, on the contrary, moderate pain is often accompanied with feel|ings not altogether di&s;agreeable. The highe&s;t animal gratification, indeed, is clo&s;ely con|nected with di&s;gu&s;t, and it is difficult to avoid the latter, after the enjoyment of the former. Hence prudence enjoins us to re&s;train violent &s;en&s;ations and affections, before they have at|tained the highe&s;t degree.</P>
<P>The illu&s;trious MEAD, in his "Medical Precepts and Cautions," originally written in Latin, when treating of the affections of the mind, makes the following remarks, the truth of which has induced me to in&s;ert them:</P>
<P>"All mankind," &s;ays that medical philo&s;o|pher, "have a natural de&s;ire for the enjoy|ment
<PB N="304" REF="039111_0627_10136E4FE5AC1E88">
of plea&s;ures, which are of two different kinds, namely, the &s;en&s;ual and mental.&mdash;The former engro&s;s the greate&s;t part of men, while tho&s;e few only "whom kind Jove has be|friended," are captivated with the charms of intellectual plea&s;ure. The rea&s;on why &s;o great a proportion of thinking beings indulge in &s;en&s;uality is obvious: it proceeds from be|ing unacquainted with the &s;erenity of mind re|&s;ulting from a dignified conduct, and the joy that animates a good man, when his rea&s;on pre&s;ides over his pa&s;&s;ions. But the &s;en&s;uali&s;t, being devoted to grovelling enjoyments, is in|capable of reli&s;hing the real charms of Virtue, and the &s;uperior beauties of Nature. The man who wi&s;hes to enjoy true happine&s;s &s;hould habituate his mind to cheri&s;h Virtue, and care|fully avoid the opportunities which excite and inflame the pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>"CICERO illu&s;trates this by a &s;entiment of CATO, which he received from the great ARCHYTAS, of Tarentum;&mdash;"that Nature never afflicted mankind with a more de&s;truc|tive di&s;ea&s;e than the pur&s;uit of bodily plea&s;ure, which &s;timulates to enjoyment with ungovern|able ra&s;hne&s;s."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>De Senectute,</HI> cap. xii.</NOTE> Indeed, the peru&s;al of that great philo&s;opher's writings, on this &s;ubject, mu&s;t delight the mind of every rational man: and Virtue's exclamation, in SILIUS ITALI|CUS, is equally ju&s;t and impre&s;&s;ive:&mdash;

renders the body le&s;s &s;ubject to the&s;e turbulent emotions. And this ob&s;ervation is applicable not only to individuals who are naturally of a hot con&s;titution, but even to tho&s;e who con|trol their appetites; becau&s;e moderation is a great means of tranquilli&s;ing the mind."</P>
<P><HI>Cleanline&s;s</HI> is a principal duty of man, and an unclean or filthy per&s;on is never completely healthy. It is better to wa&s;h our&s;elves ten times a day, than to allow one dirty &s;pot to remain on the &s;kin. On a place where impu|rities are &s;uffered to clog the pores, not only in&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration, but likewi&s;e the ab&s;orp|tion by the &s;kin is entirely &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; and if the whole body be, as it were, covered with a varni&s;h formed of per&s;pirable matter, it is im|po&s;&s;ible that a per&s;on in &s;uch a &s;tate can po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ound blood, or enjoy good health.</P>
<P>Many di&s;ea&s;es originate from an impure <HI>at|mo&s;phere,</HI> but a &s;till greater number from the &s;udden changes of the temperature of the <HI>air.</HI> Hence the nece&s;&s;ity of expo&s;ing our&s;elves daily to &s;uch changes, and of renewing the air in the hou&s;e and apartments we inhabit, by open|ing the doors and windows every clear morn|ing, or during the day, as often as convenient. Indeed, to encounter cold weather, however inten&s;e, has the effect of bracing the fibres of the &s;y&s;tem in general, and is attended with danger only, when we &s;uddenly remove to a warmer temperature. For this rea&s;on, it is extremely injudicious, and a bad compliment paid to a vi&s;itor, to invite him to the fire-&s;ide, upon his fir&s;t entering a hou&s;e; we &s;hould bet|ter con&s;ult his health, by conducting him to a
<PB N="306" REF="039111_0629_1013A449ADEDACD8">
cold room, or to &s;ome di&s;tance from the fire, till the temperature of his body be more equal to that of the apartment.</P>
<P>Every thing calculated to remove or cure di&s;ea&s;es may al&s;o produce them; for, whatev|er has a tendency to accompli&s;h u&s;eful changes in the body, may, under different and op|po&s;ite circum&s;tances, be attended with the con|trary effect. Hence no <HI>medicine</HI> whatever ought to be u&s;ed as daily food&mdash;a favourite practice among invalids, valetudinarians, and the votaries in quack medicines.</P>
<P>Feeble individuals ought to eat frequently, and but little at a time: the number of meals &s;hould corre&s;pond with the want of &s;trength;&mdash;for it is le&s;s hurtful to a debilitated per&s;on to eat a few mouthfuls every hour, than to make two or three hearty meals in one day; yet this ob&s;ervation is liable to exceptions, re|&s;pecting tho&s;e per&s;ons who have naturally weak &s;tomachs.</P>
<P>There is no in&s;tance on record of any per&s;on having injured his health, or endangered his life, by <HI>drinking water</HI> with his meals; but wine, beer, and &s;pirits have produced a much greater number and diver&s;ity of patients, than would fill all the ho&s;pitals in the world. Such are the effects of intemperance in diet, par|ticularly in the u&s;e of drink; for neither beer, wine, nor &s;pirits, are of them&s;elves detrimental, is u&s;ed with moderation, and in a proper habit of body.</P>
<P>It is a vulgar prejudice, that water di&s;agrees with many con&s;titutions, and does not promote dige&s;tion &s;o well as wine, beer, or &s;pirits: on the contrary, <HI>pure water</HI> is preferable to all
<PB N="307" REF="039111_0630_1013A44C424EAAF0">
brewed and di&s;tilled liquors, both for bracing the dige&s;tive organ, and preventing complaints which ari&s;e from acrimony, and fulne&s;s of the blood.</P>
<P>It is an ob&s;ervation not le&s;s important than true, that by attending merely to a <HI>proper diet,</HI> a phlegmatic habit may frequently be changed into a &s;anguine one, and the hypochondriac may be &s;o far altered, as to become a cheerful and contented member of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The duration of <HI>work</HI> or <HI>exerci&s;e</HI> cannot be ea&s;ily a&s;certained, with regard to every indi|vidual. Generally &s;peaking, we ought to work only when we feel a natural inclination to ei|ther literary or mechanical labours. To force our&s;elves to any exertions, particularly tho&s;e of the mind, is productive of imperfect per|formances.&mdash;It is better to exerci&s;e the mind in fine than in bad weather; but tho&s;e who are continually making excur&s;ions in the for|mer, cannot u&s;efully employ them&s;elves in the latter.</P>
<P>Of the twenty-four hours of a day, we ought, in a good &s;tate of health, to devote upon an average twelve hours to u&s;eful occu|pations, &s;ix to meals, amu&s;ements, or recrea|tions, and &s;ix to &s;leep. This would be at once a natural and arithmetical proportion. It is, however, to be regretted that the hours cannot be thus accurately divided.&mdash;An in|du&s;trious per&s;on frequently counts but twenty-three hours in a day; as one and &s;ometimes even two hours &s;lide away imperceptibly.</P>
<P>"Sleep," &s;ays Dr. MEAD, in the &s;equel of the work abovementioned, "is the &s;weet
<PB N="308" REF="039111_0631_1013A44EE08C5A08">
&s;oother of cares and re&s;torer of mu&s;cular en|ergy, which is wa&s;ted by bodily and mental exertions during the day. But exce&s;&s;ive &s;leep has its inconveniences; for it blunts the &s;en&s;es, &s;tupifies the mental faculties, and renders both le&s;s fit for performing the duties of active life. The proper time for &s;leep is the night, when darkne&s;s and &s;ilence invite and cheri&s;h it; but &s;leep during the day is le&s;s refre&s;hing. The ob&s;ervance of this rule, if proper for the mul|titude, is &s;till more nece&s;&s;ary for per&s;ons devot|ed to literary pur&s;uits, who&s;e bodies and minds are more &s;u&s;ceptible of injuries."</P>
<P>The modern inventions for promoting lux|ury and effeminacy are really &s;urpri&s;ing. It were to be wi&s;hed, that the ingenious contri|vers could be per&s;uaded, that their pernicious arts re&s;emble tho&s;e of the Quacks, who&s;e poi|&s;onous productions gradually, though ulti|mately con&s;ume the vital &s;pirits of their vic|tims.&mdash;Every new expedient we u&s;e, with a de&s;ign to dimini&s;h the labour of man, and en|courage indolence, is an additional proof that our age is not in a &s;tate of improvement, but rather on the decline. Wretched is the man who requires the aid of Art, more than of Nature, to prolong his life, and to &s;upport &s;o precarious an exi&s;tence!&mdash;Conveniency leads to effeminacy; effeminacy to general relaxa|tion; and this is eventually attended with total enervation and imbecility.</P>
<P>"Although plea&s;ure, riches, power, and other things (concludes the author before quoted), which are called the gifts of Fortune, &s;eem to be dealt out to mankind with too

much partiality, yet there is a greater degree of equality of tho&s;e things which con&s;titute real happine&s;s, than is generally imagined. People in the lower ranks enjoy the common advantages of exi&s;tence more inten&s;ely than tho&s;e in the higher walks of life. Whole&s;ome food is acquired by moderate labour, which improves the appetite and dige&s;tion: hence &s;ound &s;leep, uninterrupted by corroding cares, refre&s;hes the wearied limbs; a healthy progeny fills the cottage; and the &s;ons perform their father's labour, making his hoary locks &s;it comfortably on him. How va&s;tly inferior to the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings are the delicacies of the affluent, which are ever accompanied with real evils. Their appetites, in order to reli&s;h their food, mu&s;t be &s;timulated by poignant &s;auces, which heat and vitiate the blood, and render the body liable to di&s;tempers. Their exce&s;&s;es di&s;|turb their repo&s;e; and as a puni&s;hment for their vices, their &s;ons, who ought to be the ornament and &s;upport of their families, con|tract di&s;ea&s;es from their mother's womb, and are afflicted with infirmities through the cour&s;e of a languid life, which &s;eldom reaches to old age. They are frequently tortured with anx|ieties for obtaining honours and titles, in&s;o|much that they lo&s;e the advantages of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, by the vain de&s;ire of new acqui&s;i|tions:

&s;upplying the body with &s;uperabundant nour|i&s;hment, the faculties of the &s;oul are &s;tupified, and the pa&s;&s;ions inflamed; while the &s;paring and homely diet of the laborious poor neither oppre&s;&s;es the bodily functions, nor fo&s;ters a propen&s;ity to vice. Hence, unle&s;s prudence be a con&s;tant attendant on opulence, it is, in the&s;e re&s;pects, better and more conducive to the pre&s;ervation of health and prolongation of life, to live on a &s;mall fortune.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P>IT has been frequently and ju&s;tly remarked, that popular books on medical &s;ubjects are generally deficient in their practical applica|tion; in&s;omuch that they leave the reader doubtful, <HI>whether</HI> and <HI>when</HI> he is to apply for profe&s;&s;ional advice. As my de&s;ign, in the&s;e Lectures, has not been to lay down particular rules for the di&s;tinction and treatment of di&s;|ea&s;es, but rather for their prevention, and con&s;equently for the pre&s;ervation of health, I think it my duty to remark here, that a work &s;eems to be wanting, which &s;hould impart in|&s;truction to general readers, how to di&s;tingui&s;h di&s;ea&s;es, and how to treat them by a due and &s;trict attention to diet and regimen, as well as to regulate the habits, peculiarities, tempera|ment, and, in &s;hort, the whole &s;tate of the patient's mind and body:&mdash;&s;uch a work being a de&s;ideratum of the pre&s;ent age.</P>
<P>When I began the revi&s;al of the&s;e Lectures, for the &s;econd edition, I had it in contempla|tion to give the outlines of a treati&s;e corre&s;pond|ing with this de&s;cription: but being confined within the limits of a &s;ingle volume, and con|&s;cious that a mere &s;ketch of &s;o exten&s;ive and important a work could be of little if any <HI>prac|tical</HI> benefit, I have purpo&s;ely delayed the pub|lication
<PB N="313" REF="039111_0636_1013A459625D2268">
of the whole to another year, when a &s;eparate volume &s;hall conclude my dietetical labours.</P>
<P>Having treated, in the pre&s;ent volumes of almo&s;t every &s;ubject that relates to the man|agement of the human body, in its <HI>healthy</HI> &s;tate, my next work &s;hall be entirely appropriated to its treatment in a <HI>di&s;ea&s;ed</HI> &s;tate.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Editor has for &s;ome time expected this &s;econd volume, with a view to propo&s;e it to the public as &s;oon as it is received.</NOTE> It &s;hall com|prehend an accurate and clear de&s;cription of Di&s;ea&s;es, together with a plan founded on the rules of experience, how to treat and eventu|ally to cure them, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of a chronic nature. The admini&s;tration of medicine ought, in &s;uch a work, to be only a &s;econdary mean of removing di&s;ea&s;e, as it will be admitted by the mo&s;t enlightened and candid of the Pro|fe&s;&s;ion, that, by &s;trictly medical remedies, we can cure <HI>&s;ymptoms,</HI> and afford occa&s;ional alle|viation of pain; but that we cannot effect a favourable change in the nature and progre&s;s of a di&s;ea&s;e, whether chronic or acute, with|out due attention to food, drink, air, &s;leep, exerci&s;e, or re&s;t, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Hence I hope to be exempt from the charge of pre&s;umption, when I venture into a larger field of inquiry than has hitherto been explored by practitioners; for, as novelty is not my object, though I think that too little has been done by profe&s;&s;ional men, in guid|ing the unhappy &s;ufferer, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting him with tho&s;e &s;imple remedies which are placed more immediately around him, I &s;hall enter upon

my propo&s;ed work with the confidence ari&s;ing from the importance and utility of the under|taking in which I am engaged.</P>
<P>It is much to be regretted, that the boun|daries between &s;afety and danger cannot be per&s;picuou&s;ly a&s;certained in a popular book, without deviating from the u&s;ual terms and definitions adopted by medical writers: but I &s;hall not he&s;itate to avail my&s;elf of &s;uch famil|iar phra&s;es and expre&s;&s;ions as will render my works intelligible to the generality of readers. To afford a &s;hort &s;pecimen of this deviation, for which I allege the re&s;pectable authority of the late Dr. TISSOT, I have &s;ubjoined a few Queries, which ought to be di&s;tinctly an&s;wered by individuals who con&s;ult a phy&s;ician, whether per&s;onally or by letter. Indeed, it is not al|ways an ea&s;y or practicable ta&s;k to form an ac|curate judgment of the &s;tate of a patient, with|out an interview, let his ca&s;e be ever &s;o accu|rately and circum&s;tantially de&s;cribed: yet mo&s;t of the difficulties will be removed, if the fol|lowing que&s;tions be an&s;wered with candour and preci&s;ion. For, as the &s;ucce&s;s of the medicine entirely depends on a previous knowledge of the di&s;ea&s;e, this knowledge can, in &s;uch ca&s;es be derived only from a clear and faithful ac|count communicated to the phy&s;ician.</P>
