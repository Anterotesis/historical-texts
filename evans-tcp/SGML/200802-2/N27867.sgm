<P>MR. Bragwell and Mr. Worthy hap|pened to meet la&s;t year at Weyhill Fair. They were glad to &s;ee each other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> they had but &s;eldom met of late; Mr. Bragwell having removed &s;ome years be|fore from Mr. Worthy's neighbourhood to a di&s;tant village where he had bough an E&s;tate.</P>
<P>Mr. Bragwell was a &s;ub&s;tantial Farme<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> and Grazier. He had ri&s;en in the wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> by what worldly men call a run of goo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> fortune. He had al&s;o been a man of great indu&s;try; that is, he had paid a dilige<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> and con&s;tant attention to his own intere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> He under&s;tood bu&s;ine&s;s, and had a kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> of turning almo&s;t every thing to his own advantage. He had that &s;ort of &s;en&s;e which good men call cunning, and knave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> call wi&s;dom. He was too prudent eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to do any thing &s;o wrong that the law could take hold of him; yet he was not over &s;crupulous about the morality of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> action, when the pro&s;pect of enriching him&s;elf by it was very great, and the
<PB N="4" REF="037132_0003_100C91DDC9C8CA90">
chance of hurting his character was &s;mall. The corn he &s;ent home to his cu&s;tomers was not always quite &s;o good as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">amples he had produced at Market, and he now and then forgot to name &s;ome ca|pital blemi&s;h in the hor&s;es he &s;old at the Fair. He &s;corned to be guilty of the pet|ty frauds of cheating in weights and mea|&s;ures, for he thought that was a beggarly &s;in; but he valued him&s;elf on his &s;kill in making a bargain, and fancied it &s;hewed his knowledge of the world to take advan|tage of the ignorance of a dealer.</P>
<P>It was his con&s;tant rule to undervalue every thing he was about to buy, and to overvalue every thing he was about to &s;ell; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> as he prided him&s;elf on his character he avoided every thing that was very &s;hameful, &s;o that he was con&s;idered mere|ly as a hard dealer, and a keen hand at a bargain. Now and then when he had been caught in pu&s;hing his own advantage too far, he contrived to get out of the &s;crape by turning the whole into a je&s;t, &s;aying it was a good take in, a rare joke and that he had only a mind to divert him|&s;elf with the folly of his neighbour who could be &s;o ea&s;ily impo&s;ed on.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="037132_0004_100C91DFB3723A20">
Mr. Bragwell had one favourite max+im, namely, that a man's &s;ucce&s;s in life was a &s;ure proof of his wi&s;dom; and that all failure and misfortune was the con+&s;equence of a man's own folly. As thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> opinion was fir&s;t taken up by him from vanity and ignorance; &s;o it was more and more confirmed by his own pro&s;perity&punc; He &s;aw that he him&s;elf had &s;ucceeded greatly without either money or educati+on to begin with, and he therefore no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> de&s;pi&s;ed every Man, however excelle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> his character or talents might be, who ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> not had the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s in life.

to Mr. Worthy, whom he looked upon not only as a good but a wi&s;e man. They had been bred up when children in the &s;ame hou&s;e, but with this differ|ence, that Worthy was the nephew of the ma&s;ter, and Bragwell the &s;on of the &s;er|vant.</P>
<P>Bragwell's father had been ploughman in the family of Mr. Worthy's uncle, a &s;en&s;ible man, who farmed a &s;mall e&s;tate of his own, and who, having no children, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">red up young Worthy as his &s;on, in|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ructed him in the bu&s;ine&s;s of hu&s;bandry and at his death left him his e&s;tate. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ather of Worthy was a pious Clergyman who lived with his brother the farmer, in order to help out a narrow income. He and be&s;towed much pains on the in&s;tructi|on of his &s;on, and u&s;ed frequently to re|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">eat to him a &s;aying which he had picked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">p in a book, written by one of the great|e&s;t men in this Country, "that there were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">wo things with which every man ought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o be acquainted, RELIGION AND HIS <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">WN BUSINESS. While he therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ook care that his &s;on &s;hould be made an excellent Farmer, he filled up his lei&s;ure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ours in improving his mind; &s;o that
<PB N="7" REF="037132_0006_100C91E3A019AAA8">
young Worthy had read more good Books and under&s;tood them better than mo&s;t men in his &s;tation. His reading howe|ver had been chiefly confined to hu&s;ban|dry and divinity, the two &s;ubjects which were of the mo&s;t immediate importance to him.</P>
<P>The reader will &s;ee by this time that Mr. Bragwell and Mr. Worthy were likely to be as oppo&s;ite to each other as two men could well be, who were nearly of the &s;ame age and condition, and who were neither of them without credit in the world. Bragwell indeed made far the greater figure, for he liked to <HI>cut a dash,</HI> as he called it. And while it was the &s;tudy of Worthy to conform to his &s;tati|on, and to &s;et a good example to tho&s;e about him, it was the delight of Bragwell to vie in his way of life with men of lar|ger fortune. He did not &s;ee how much this vanity rai&s;ed the ill-will of his equals and the contempt of his betters.</P>
<P>His Wife was a notable &s;tirring Wo|man, but vain, violent and ambitious; very ignorant, and very high minded. She had married Bragwell before he was
<PB N="8" REF="037132_0007_100C91E5F891A8B0">
worth a &s;hilling, and as &s;he had brought him a good deal of money, &s;he thought her&s;elf the grand cau&s;e of his ri&s;ing in the world, and thence took occa&s;ion to govern him mo&s;t completely. Whenever he ven|tured to oppo&s;e her &s;he took care to put him in mind, "that he owed every thing to her, that had it not been for her he might &s;till have been &s;tumping after a Plow-tail, or &s;erving Hogs in old Worthy's Farm-Yard, but that it was &s;he who had made a Gentleman of him. In order to &s;et about making him a Gentleman, &s;he began by teazing him till he had turned away all his poor relations who worked in the Farm. She next drew him off from keeping company with his old ac|quaintance, and at la&s;t per&s;uaded him to remove from the place where he had got his money. Poor Woman! &s;he had not &s;en&s;e and virtue enough to &s;ee how ho|nourable it is for a man to rai&s;e him&s;elf in the world by fair means, and then to help forward his poor relations and friends, engaging their &s;ervice by his kindne&s;s, and endeavouring to keep want out of his family.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="037132_0008_100C91E7E6C98120">
Mrs. Bragwell was an excellent mi&s;|tre&s;s, according to her own notions of excellence, for no one could &s;ay that &s;he ever lo&s;t an opportunity of &s;colding a &s;er|vant, or was ever guilty of the weakne&s;s of overlooking a fault. Towards her two daughters her behaviour was far other|wi&s;e. In them &s;he could &s;ee nothing but perfections: but her extravagant fondne&s;s for the&s;e girls was full as much owing to pride as to affection. She was bent on making a family, and having found out that &s;he was too ignorant, and too much trained to the habits of getting money, ever to hope to make a figure her&s;elf, &s;he looked to her daughters as the per&s;ons who were to rai&s;e the family of the Brag|wells: And in this hope &s;he fooli&s;hly &s;ubmitted to any drudgery for their &s;akes, and to any impertinence from them.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t wi&s;h of her heart was to &s;et them above their neighbours; for &s;he u|&s;ed to &s;ay "what was the u&s;e of having &s;ub&s;tance, if her daughters might not car|ry them&s;elves above girls who had no|thing?" To do her ju&s;tice, &s;he her&s;elf would be about early and late to &s;ee tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the bu&s;ine&s;s of the hou&s;e was not neglect|ed.
<PB N="10" REF="037132_0009_100C91E9727CF128">
She had been bred to great indu&s;try, and continued to work when it was no longer nece&s;&s;ary, both from early habit, and the de&s;ire of heaping up money for her daughters. Yet her whole notion of gentility was, that it con&s;i&s;ted in being rich and idle, and though &s;he was willing to be a drudge her&s;elf, &s;he re&s;olved to make her daughters gentlewomen. To be well dre&s;&s;ed, and to do nothing, or no|thing that was of any u&s;e, was what &s;he fancied di&s;tingui&s;hed people in genteel life. And this is too common a notion of a fine education among &s;ome people. They do not e&s;teem things by their u&s;e, but by their &s;hew. They e&s;timate the va|lue of their children's education by the money it co&s;ts, and not by the knowledge and goodne&s;s it be&s;tows. People of this &s;tamp often take a pride in the expence of learning, in&s;tead of taking plea&s;ure in the advantage of it. And the &s;illy vanity of letting others &s;ee that they can afford any thing, often &s;ets parents on letting their daughters learn not only things of no u&s;e, but things which may be really hurtful in their &s;ituation; either by &s;et|ting them above their proper duties, or
<PB N="11" REF="037132_0010_100C91EBC33F3CE0">
by taking up their time in a way incon|&s;i&s;tent with them.</P>
<P>Mrs. Bragwell &s;ent her daughters to a boarding School, where &s;he wi&s;hed them to hold up their heads as high as any bo|dy; to have more &s;pirit than <HI>to be put up|on</HI> by any one, never to be pitiful about money, but rather to &s;hew that they could &s;pend with the be&s;t; to keep company with the riche&s;t girls in the School, and to make no acquaintance with Farmer's Daughters.</P>
<P>They came home at the u&s;ual age of leaving School, with a large portion of vanity grafted on their native ignorance. The vanity was added but the ignorance was not taken away. Of Religion they could not po&s;&s;ibly learn any thing, &s;ince none was taught, for at that place it was con&s;idered as a part of education which belonged only to Charity Schools. Of knowledge they got ju&s;t enough to laugh at their fond parents' ru&s;tic manners and vulgar language, and ju&s;t enough ta&s;te to de&s;pi&s;e and ridicule every girl who was not as vainly dre&s;&s;ed as them&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="037132_0011_100C91EDC5C6B2E0">
The Mother had been comforting her|&s;elf for the heavy expence of their bring|ing up, by looking forward to the plea|&s;ure of &s;eeing them become fine ladies, and to the pride of marrying them above their &s;tation.</P>
<P>Their Father hoped al&s;o that they would be a comfort to him both in &s;ick|ne&s;s and in health. He had no learning him&s;elf, and could write but poorly, and owed what &s;kill he had in figures to his natural turn for bu&s;ine&s;s. He hoped that his daughters, after all the money he had &s;pent on them, would now write his let|ters and keep his accounts. And as he was now and then laid up with a fit of the gout, he was enjoying the pro&s;pect of having two affectionate children to nur&s;e him.</P>
<P>When they came home however, he had the mortification to find, that though he had two &s;mart &s;howy ladies to vi&s;it him, he had neither dutiful daughters to nur&s;e him, nor faithful &s;tewards to keep his books. They neither &s;oothed him by kindne&s;s when he was &s;ick, nor helped him when he was bu&s;y. They thought
<PB N="13" REF="037132_0012_100C91F070F8C610">
the maid might take care of him in the gout as &s;he did before. And as to their &s;kill in cyphering he &s;oon found to his co&s;t, that though they knew how to <HI>spend</HI> both Pounds, Shillings, and Pence, yet they did not know &s;o well how to ca&s;t them up.</P>
<P>Mrs. Bragwell one day being very bu|&s;y in making a great dinner for the neigh|bours, ventured to reque&s;t her daughters to a&s;&s;i&s;t in making the pa&s;try. They a&s;ked her &s;cornfully "whether &s;he had &s;ent them to Boarding School to learn to cook; and added, that they &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he would ex|pect them next to make puddings for the bay-makers." So &s;aying they coolly march|ed off to their mu&s;ic. When the Mo|ther found her girls were too polite to be of any u&s;e, &s;he would take comfort in ob|&s;erving how her parlour was &s;et out with their Fillagree and Flowers, their Em|broidery and cut paper. They &s;pent the morning in bed, the noon in dre&s;&s;ing, the evening at the Spinnet, and the night in reading Novels.</P>
<P>With all the&s;e fine qualifications it is ea&s;y to &s;uppo&s;e that as they de&s;pi&s;ed their
<PB N="14" REF="037132_0013_100C91F2132A4FA0">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ober duties, they no le&s;s de&s;pi&s;ed their plain neighbours. When they could not get to a hor&s;e race, a petty ball, or a &s;trol|ling play, with &s;ome company as idle and as &s;mart as them&s;elves, they were driven for amu&s;ement to the Circulating Library. Jack the plowboy, on whom they had now put a livery jacket, was employed half his time in trotting backwards and forwards with the mo&s;t wretched tra&s;h the little neighbouring book &s;hop could fur|ni&s;h. The choice was often left to Jack, who could not read, but who had gene|ral orders to bring all the new things, and a great many of them.</P>
<P>Things were in this &s;tate, or rather growing wor&s;e, for idlene&s;s and vanity are never at a &s;tand; when the&s;e two wealthy farmers, Bragwell and Worthy met at Weyhill Fair, as was &s;aid before. After many hearty &s;alutations had pa&s;&s;ed between them, it was agreed that Mr. Bragwell &s;hould &s;pend the next day with his old friend, who&s;e hou&s;e was not many miles di&s;tant, which Bragwell invited him&s;elf to do in the following manner, "we have not had a comfortable day's that for years, &s;aid he, and as I am to
<PB N="15" REF="037132_0014_100C91F412FEF9E0">
look at a drove of lean bea&s;ts in your neighbourhood, I will take a bed at your hou&s;e, and we will pa&s;s the evening in debating as we u&s;ed to do. You know I always loved a bit of an argument, and am reckoned not to make the wor&s;t figure at our club: I had not, to be &s;ure, &s;uch good learning as you had, becau&s;e your father was a Par&s;on, and you got it for nothing. But I can bear my part pretty well for all that. When any man talks to me about his learning, I a&s;k if it has helped him to get a good e&s;tate; if he &s;ays no, then I would not give him a ru&s;h for it; for of what u&s;e is all the learning in the world if it does not make a man rich? But as I was &s;aying, I will come and &s;ee you to-morrow; but now don't let your wife put her&s;elf into a fu&s;s for me. Don't alter your own plain way, for I am not proud I a&s;&s;ure you, nor above my old friends, though I thank GOD I am pret|ty well in the world.</P>
<P>To all this flouri&s;hing &s;peech Mr. Wor|thy coolly an&s;wered, that certainly world|ly pro&s;perity ought never to make any man proud &s;ince it is GOD who giveth &s;trength to get riches, and without his
<PB N="16" REF="037132_0015_100C91F609D88DB8">
ble&s;&s;ing <HI>'tis in vain to rise up early and to eat the bread of carefulness.</HI></P>
<P>About the middle of the next day Mr. Bragwell reached Mr. Worthy's neat and plea&s;ant dwelling. He found every thing in it the rever&s;e of his own. It had not &s;o many ornaments but it had more comforts. And when he &s;aw his friend's good old fa&s;hioned arm chair in a warm corner, he gave a &s;igh, to think how his own had been bani&s;hed to make room for his daughter's Mu&s;ic. In&s;tead of made flowers in gla&s;s ca&s;es, and a tea che&s;t and &s;creen too fine to be u&s;ed, and about which he was cautioned, and &s;colded as often as he came near them, he &s;aw a neat &s;helf of good books for the &s;ervice of the family, and a &s;mall medicine che&s;t for the benefit of the poor.</P>
<P>Mrs. Worthy and her daughters had prepared a plain but neat and good din|ner. The tarts were &s;o excellent that Bragwell felt a &s;ecret kind of regret that his own daughters were too genteel to do any thing &s;o very u&s;eful. Indeed he had been always unwilling to believe that any thing which was very proper and very
<PB N="17" REF="037132_0016_100C91F7E5813628">
nece&s;&s;ary, could be &s;o extremely vulgar and unbecoming as his daughters were always declaring it to be. And his late experience of the little comfort he found at home, inclined him now &s;till more &s;trongly to &s;u&s;pect that things were not &s;o right as he had been made to &s;uppo&s;e. But it was in vain to &s;peak; for his daugh|ters con&s;tantly &s;topped his mouth by a favourite &s;aying of theirs, "better be out of the world than out of the fa&s;hion."</P>
<P>Soon after dinner the women went out to their &s;everal employments, and Mr. Worthy being left alone with his gue&s;t the following di&s;cour&s;e took place.</P>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Bragwell, in the man|agement of my family, I don't con&s;ider what I might afford only, though that is one great point; but I con&s;ider al&s;o what is needful and becoming in a man of my
<PB N="18" REF="037132_0017_100C91F972596780">
&s;tation, for there are &s;o many u&s;eful ways of laying out money, that I feel as if it were a &s;in to &s;pend one unnece&s;&s;ary &s;hil|ling. Having had the ble&s;&s;ing of a good education my&s;elf, I have been able to give the like advantage to my daughters. One of the be&s;t le&s;&s;ons I have taught them is, to know them&s;elves: and one proof that they have learnt this le&s;&s;on is, that they are not above any of the duties of their &s;tation. They read and write well, and when my eyes are bad they keep my accounts in a very pretty manner, If I had put them to learn what you call <HI>genteel things</HI> the&s;e might either have been of no u&s;e to them, and &s;o both time and money might have been thrown away; or they might have proved wor&s;e than nothing to them by leading them into wrong notions; and wrong company. Though we don't wi&s;h them to do the laborious parts of the dairy work, yet they always a&s;&s;i&s;t their Mother in the management of it. As to their appearance, they are every day nearly as you &s;ee them now, and on Sun|days they are very neatly dre&s;&s;ed, but it is always in a decent and mode&s;t way. There are no lappets, fringes, furbelows, and tawdry ornaments, fluttering about

among my chee&s;e and butter. And I &s;hould feel no vanity, but much mortifi|cation, if a &s;tranger &s;eeing Farmer Wor|thy's daughters at Church &s;hould a&s;k who tho&s;e fine ladies were?</P>

<P>For my part, before I engage in any expence I always a&s;k my&s;elf the&s;e two &s;hort que&s;tions, Fir&s;t, can I afford it?&mdash;Secondly&mdash;Is it proper for me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you &s;o? Now I own I a&s;k my&s;elf but one. For if I find I can afford it, I take care to make it proper for me. If I can pay for a thing, no one has a right to hinder me from having it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly. But a man's own prudence and &s;en&s;e of duty, ought to pre|vent
<PB N="20" REF="037132_0019_100C91FDAAA30A00">
him from doing an improper thing, as effectually as if there were &s;omebody to hinder him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now I think a man is a fool who is hindered from having any thing he has a mind to; unle&s;s indeed he is in want of money to pay for it; I am no friend to debt. A poor man mu&s;t want on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I hope my children have learnt not to want any thing which is not proper for them. They are very indu&s;|trious, they attend to bu&s;ine&s;s all day; and in the evening they &s;it down to their work and a good book. I think they live in the fear of GOD. I tru&s;t they are hum|ble and pious, and I am &s;ure they &s;eem cheerful and happy. If I am &s;ick, it is plea&s;ant to &s;ee them di&s;pute which &s;hall wait upon me; for they &s;ay the maid cannot do it &s;o tenderly as them|&s;elves.&mdash;</P>
<P>This part of the di&s;cour&s;e &s;taggered Bragwell. Vain as he was, he could not help feeling what a difference a religious and a worldly education made on the
<PB N="21" REF="037132_0020_100C91FF8B8D1F70">
heart, and how much the former regula|ted even the natural temper. Another thing which &s;urpri&s;ed him was, that the&s;e girls living a life of dome&s;tic piety, with|out any public diver&s;ions, &s;hould be &s;o very cheerful and happy, while his own daughters, who were never contradicted, and were indulged with continual amu&s;e|ments, were always &s;ullen and ill tem|pered. That they who were more hu|moured &s;hould be le&s;s grateful and hap|py, di&s;turbed him much. He envied Worthy the tenderne&s;s of his children, though he would not own it, but turned it off thus.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>But my girls are too &s;mart to make mopes of, that is the truth. Though ours is &s;uch a lonely village, 'tis wonderful to &s;ee how &s;oon they get the fa&s;hions. What with the de&s;criptions in the Magazines, and the pictures in the pocket Books, they have them in a twink|ling, and out-do their patterns all to no|thing. I u&s;ed to take in the Country Jour|nal, becau&s;e it was u&s;eful enough to &s;ee how Oats went, the time of high water, and the price of Stocks. But when my ladies came home for&s;ooth, I was &s;oon
<PB N="22" REF="037132_0021_100C92016A0683B0">
wheedled out of that, and forced to take a London paper, that tells a deal about caps and feathers, and all the trumpery of the quality. When I want to know what hops are a bag, they are &s;natching the paper to &s;ee what violet &s;oap is a pound. And as to the dairy, they never care how Cow's milk goes, as long as they can get &s;ome &s;tuff which they call Milk of Ro&s;es.</P>

<P>But do your daughters never read?</P>

<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Read! I believe they do too. Why our Jack the Plow boy &s;pends half his time in going to a &s;hop in our Market town, where they let out books to read with marble covers. And they &s;ell paper with all manner of colours on the edges, and gim cracks, and powder-puffs, and wa&s;h-balls, and cards without any pips, and every thing in the world that's genteel and of no u&s;e. 'Twas but t'other day I met Jack with a ba&s;ket full of the&s;e books, &s;o having &s;ome time to &s;pare, I &s;at down to &s;ee a little what they were about.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>O as to that, you are pret|ty much out. I could make neither head nor tail of it. It was neither fi&s;h, fle&s;h, nor good red-herring. It was all about my Lord, and Sir Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">y and the Cap|tain. But I never met with &s;uch non&s;en|&s;ical fellows in my life. Their talk was no more like that of my old landlord, who was a Lord you know, nor the Cap|tain of our fencibles, than chalk is like chee&s;e. I was fairly taken in at fir&s;t, and began to think I had got hold of a <HI>godly</HI> book, for there was a deal about "hope and de&s;pair, and heaven, and Angels, and torments, and everla&s;ting happine&s;s." But when I got a little on, I found there was no meaning in all the&s;e words, or if any, 'twas a bad meaning. "Mi&s;ery" perhaps only meant a di&s;appointment a|bout a bit of a letter: and "everla&s;ting happine&s;s" meant two people talking non&s;en&s;e together for five minutes. In &s;hort, I never met with &s;uch a pack of lies. The people talk &s;uch gibberi&s;h as no folks in their &s;ober &s;en&s;es ever talked;
<PB N="24" REF="037132_0023_100C9205807D0000">
and the things that happen to them are not like the things that ever happen to any of my acquaintance. They are at home one minute, and beyond &s;ea the next. Beggars to-day, and Lord's to|morrow. Waiting maids in the morning, and Duche&s;&s;es at night. You and I, Ma&s;|ter Worthy, have worked hard many years, and think it very well to have &s;cra|ped a trifle of money together, you a few hundreds I &s;uppo&s;e, and I a few thou&s;ands. But one would think every man in the&s;e books had the Bank of England in his &s;crutoire. Then there's another thing which I never met with in true life. We think it pretty well you know, if one has got one thing, and another has got ano|ther. I'll tell you how I mean. You are reckoned &s;en&s;ible, our Par&s;on is learned, the Squire is rich, I am rather generous, one of your daughters is pretty, and both mine are genteel. But in the&s;e books, (except here and there one, whom they make wor&s;e than Satan him&s;elf) every man and woman's child of them, are all wi&s;e, and witty, and generous, and rich, and hand&s;ome, and genteel. Nobody is middling, or good in one thing, and bad in another, like my live acquaintance.
<PB N="25" REF="037132_0024_100C92075B6876D8">
But 'tis all up to the &s;kies, or down to the dirt. I had rather read Tom Hicka|thrift, or Jack the Giant killer.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Worthy.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have found out Mr. Bragwell, that many of the&s;e books are ridiculous, I will go farther, and &s;ay, that to me they appear wicked al&s;o. And I &s;hould account the reading of them a great mi&s;chief, e&s;pecially to people in middling and low life, if I only take into the ac|count the great lo&s;s of time &s;uch reading cau&s;es, and the aver&s;ion it leaves behind for what is more &s;erious and &s;olid. But this, though a bad part is not the wor&s;t. The&s;e books give fal&s;e views of human life. They teach a contempt for humble and dome&s;tic duties; for indu&s;try, frugali|ty, and retirement. Want of youth and beauty, is con&s;idered as ridiculous. Plain people, like you and me, are objects of contempt. Parental authority is &s;et at naught. Nay, plots and contrivances, again&s;t parents and guardians, fill half the volumes. They make love the great bu&s;ine&s;s of human life, and even teach that it is impo&s;&s;ible to be regulated or re|&s;trained, and to the indulgence of this pa&s;&s;i|on every duty is therefore &s;acrificed. A
<PB N="26" REF="037132_0025_100C9209320655E0">
country life, with a kind mother, or a &s;o|ber aunt, is de&s;cribed as a &s;tate of intole|rable mi&s;ery. And one would be apt to fancy, from their painting, that a good country hou&s;e is a pri&s;on, and a worthy father the goaler. Vice is &s;et off with every ornament which can make it plea|&s;ing and amiable; while virtue and piety are made ridiculous by tacking to them &s;omething that is &s;illy or ab&s;urd. Crimes which would be con&s;idered as hanging matter at the Old Bailey, are here made to take the appearance of virtue, by be|ing mixed with &s;ome wild flight of unna|tural genero&s;ity. Tho&s;e crying &s;ins, ADULTERY, GAMING, DUELS, and SELF MURDER, are made &s;o familiar, and the wickedne&s;s of them is &s;o di&s;gui&s;ed, that even innocent girls get to lo&s;e their ab|horrence, and to talk with complacency of <HI>things which should not be so much as named by them.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hould not have &s;aid &s;o much on this mi&s;chief, (continued Mr. Worthy,) from which I dare &s;ay, great folks fancy peo|ple in our &s;tation are &s;afe enough, if I did not know and lament that this corrupt reading is now got down even among
<PB N="27" REF="037132_0026_100C920B22120008">
&s;ome of the lowe&s;t cla&s;s, And it is an evil which is &s;preading every day. Poor indu&s;trious girls, who get their bread by the needle, or the loom, &s;pend half the night in li&s;tening to the&s;e books. Thus the labour of one girl is lo&s;t, and the minds of the re&s;t are corrupted; for though their hands are employed in hone&s;t indu&s;|try, which might help to pre&s;erve them from a life of &s;in, yet their hearts are at that very time polluted by &s;cenes and de|&s;criptions which are too likely to plunge them into it. And I think I don't go too far, when I &s;ay, that the vain and &s;hew<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> manner in which young women who have to work for their bread, have taken to dre&s;s them&s;elves, added to the poi&s;on they draw from the&s;e books, contribute toge|ther to bring them to de&s;truction, more than almo&s;t any other cau&s;e. Now tell me, don't you think the&s;e wild books will hurt your daughters?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bragwell.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why I do think they are grown full of &s;chemes, and contrivan|ces, and whi&s;pers, that's the truth on't. Every thing is a &s;ecret. They always &s;eem to be on the look out for &s;omething, and when nothing comes on't, then they
<PB N="28" REF="037132_0027_100C920D04CC12B8">
are &s;ulky and di&s;appointed. They will not keep company with their equals. They de&s;pi&s;e trade and farming, and I own, I'm for the &s;tuff. I &s;hould not like for them to marry any but a man of &s;ub|&s;tance, if he was ever &s;o &s;mart. Now they will hardly &s;it down with a &s;ub&s;tan|tial country dealer. But if they hear of a recruiting party in our Market Town, on goes the finery&mdash;off they are. Some flim&s;ey excu&s;e is patched up. They want &s;omething at the Book-&s;hop, or the Mil|lener's, becau&s;e I &s;uppo&s;e there is a chance that &s;ome Jackanapes of an En&s;ign may be there buying a Sticking plai&s;ter. In &s;hort I do grow a little unea&s;y, for I &s;hould not like to &s;ee all I have &s;aved, thrown away on a Knap&s;ack.</P>
<P>So &s;aying they both ro&s;e, and walked out to view the Farm. Mr. Bragwell <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ffected greatly to admire the good order of every thing he &s;aw; but never forgot to compare it with &s;omething larger, and hand&s;omer, or better of his own. It was ea&s;y to &s;ee that <HI>Self</HI> was the &s;tandard of perfection in every thing. All he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed gained &s;ome increa&s;ed value in his eyes from being his; and in &s;urveying the pro|perty
<PB N="29" REF="037132_0028_100C920F2308FA98">
of his friends, he derived food for his vanity, from things which &s;eemed lea&s;t likely to rai&s;e it. Every appearance of comfort, or &s;ucce&s;s, or merit in any thing which belonged to Mr. Worthy, led him to &s;peak of &s;ome &s;uperior advan|tage of his own of the &s;ame kind. And it was clear, that the chief part of the &s;atis|faction he felt in walking over the farm of his friend, was cau&s;ed by thinking how much larger his own was.</P>
<P>Mr. Worthy, who felt a kindne&s;s for him, which all his vanity could not cure, was on the watch how to turn their talk to &s;ome u&s;eful point. And whenever peo|ple re&s;olve to go into company with this view, it is commonly their own fault if &s;ome opportunity of turning it to account does not offer.</P>
<P>He &s;aw Bragwell was intoxicated with pride, and undone by pro&s;perity, and that his family was in the high road to ru|in. He thought that if &s;ome means could be found to open his eyes on his own cha|racter, to which he was now totally blind, it might be of the utmo&s;t &s;ervice to him. The more Mr. Worthy reflected, the
<PB N="30" REF="037132_0029_100C9210AFDBADB0">
more he wi&s;hed to undertake this kind office. He was not &s;ure that Mr. Brag|well would bear it, but he was very &s;ure it was his duty to attempt it. Mr. Wor|thy was very humble, and very candid, and he had great patience and forbearance with the faults of others. He felt no pride at having e&s;caped the &s;ame error, for he knew who it was had <HI>made them to differ.</HI> He remembered that God had giv|en him many advantages, a pious father and a religious Education; this made him humble under a &s;en&s;e of his own &s;ins, and charitable towards the &s;ins of others, who had not the &s;ame privileges.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t as he was going to try to enter in|to a very &s;erious conver&s;ation with his gue&s;t, he was &s;topped by the appearance of his daughter, who told them &s;upper was ready.</P>
<P>Soon after &s;upper Mrs. Worthy left the room with her daughters, at her hu&s;|band's de&s;ire; for it was his intention to &s;peak more plainly to Bragwell than was likely to be agreeable to him before others.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="037132_0030_100C9212895D5E90">
The two farmers being &s;eated at their little table, each in a hand&s;ome old fa&s;hi|oned great chair, Bragwell began.</P>
<P>It is a great comfort, neighbour Wor|thy at a certain time of life to be got a|bove the world; my notion is, that a man &s;hould labour hard the fir&s;t part of his days and that he may then &s;it down and enjoy him&s;elf for the remainder. Now though I hate boa&s;ting, yet as you are my olde&s;t friend I am about to open my heart to you. Let me tell you then I reckon I have worked as hard as any man in my time, and that I now begin to think I have a right to indulge a little. I have got my money with a good character and I mean to &s;pend it with credit. I pay e|very one his own, I &s;et a good example, I keep to my church, I &s;erve GOD, I ho|nour the king, and I obey the laws of the land.</P>
<P>This is doing a great deal indeed, re|plied Mr. Worthy, but added he, I doubt that more goes to the making up all the&s;e duties than men are commonly aware of. Suppo&s;e then that you and I talk the mat|ter over coolly, we have the evening be|fore
<PB N="32" REF="037132_0031_100C921461EA7AD8">
us. What if we &s;it down together, as two friends and examine one another.</P>
<P>Bragwell, who loved an argument, and was not a little vain both of his &s;en&s;e and his morality, accepted the challenge, and gave his word that he would take in goo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> part any thing that &s;hould be &s;aid to him. Worthy was about to proceed when Brag|well interrupted him for a moment, by &s;aying,&mdash;But &s;top friend, before we begin I wi&s;h you would remember that we have had a long walk, and I want a little re|fre&s;hment; have you no liquor that is &s;tronger than this cider? I am afraid it will give me a fit of the gout.</P>
<P>Mr. Worthy immediately produced a bottle of wine and another of &s;pirits, &s;ay|ing though he drank neither &s;pirits nor even wine him&s;elf, yet his wife always kept a little of each as a provi&s;ion in ca&s;e of &s;ickne&s;s or accident.</P>
<P>Farmer Bragwell prefered the brandy and began to ta&s;te it. Why, &s;aid he this is no better than Engli&s;h, I always u&s;e foreign <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;elf. I bought this for fo|reign, &s;aid Mr. Worthy. No no, it is
