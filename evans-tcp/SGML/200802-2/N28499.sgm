<HEAD>Eulogy.</HEAD>
<P>OUR duty, my Fellow-Town&s;men, on this di&s;tre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ion, is dictated by the dignity and re&s;plendent virtue of the beloved Man who&s;e death we deplore. We a&s;&s;emble to pay a debt to departed merit, a debt which we can only pay by the &s;incerity of our grief, and the re&s;pectful effu&s;ions of gratitude; for the high|e&s;t eulogy left us to be&s;tow upon our lamented WASHINGTON, is the &s;trict narration of the truth, and the loftie&s;t character which we can a&s;|&s;ign to him, is the very di&s;play of him&s;elf. When ambition allies it&s;elf to guilt, when power tram|ples upon right, when victory triumphs in blood, when piety &s;its clouded in &s;uper&s;tition, when hu|mility is affected by cunning, when patrioti&s;m is founded on &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s; then let adulation &s;pread her pro&s;tituted mantle, to &s;creen the di&s;graces of
<PB N="8" REF="037967_0005_10102E54B4251730">
her patrons, and amu&s;e with the fal&s;ehoods of her imagination. But to our political Father, the faithful page of hi&s;tory is panegyric, and the happine&s;s of his country is the monument of his fame.</P>
<P>COME, then, Warriors! State&s;men! Philo&s;o|phers! Citizens! a&s;&s;emble round the tomb of this favourite &s;on of virtue; with all the luxury of &s;orrow recollect the important events of his life, and partake of the greate&s;t legacy which a mortal could bequeath you, in the contemplation of his example. Whil&s;t we &s;olemnize this act, his di&s;|embodied &s;pirit, if it be permitted to retrace the &s;cenes of its terre&s;trial exi&s;tence, will &s;mile with approbation on the in&s;tructive rite.</P>
<P>YOUR anniver&s;aries have long honoured the eleventh of February, one thou&s;and &s;even hun|dred and thirty-two, as the birth-day of our il|lu&s;trious Chief, and the pari&s;h of his own name in We&s;tmoreland county, in Virginia, boa&s;ts it&s;elf the place of his nativity. But to &s;ouls like his, local re&s;trictions are not attached. Where Lib|erty was, there would be his country: Happy for us, the Genius of Liberty, re&s;pon&s;ive to his affections, re&s;olved that where WASHINGTON was, there al&s;o &s;hould be her abode.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="037967_0006_10102E56571BD138">
EDUCATED by private in&s;truction, his virtue grew with his knowledge, and the u&s;eful branch|es of literature occupied the whole powers of his mind. Exemplary for &s;olidity of thought, and cha&s;tity of morals, he was honoured by the gov|ernment of Virginia, with an important mi&s;&s;ion, at an age when the levities of the human character &s;eldom yield to the earlie&s;t operation of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>AT the opening of the great war of encroach|ments upon our we&s;tern frontiers, he was the bearer of the remon&s;trance to the French. Such was the addre&s;s, fidelity and per&s;everance with which he executed this important tru&s;t, that he was honoured at twenty-two years of age with the command of a regiment rai&s;ed by his prov|ince. His military talents were &s;oon called to the te&s;t. At Red&s;tone, Victory perched upon his &s;tandard; but, with that volatility by which &s;he tries the powers of her favourite heroes, &s;he in a few months afterwards left him, by his own exer|tions, to &s;ave the honours of war for his little band, in an unequal, but well &s;upported battle. In Braddock's &s;laughtered army, he was a wit|ne&s;s to &s;cenes of horror, which his caution, had it been adopted, would have prevented, and
<PB N="10" REF="037967_0007_10102E5C26799430">
which his &s;teady courage a&s;&s;i&s;ted much to retrieve. During the remainder of this war, he was em|ployed in fortifying his native province, in ar|ranging and perfecting its militia, and in check|ing the incur&s;ions of the enemy, until the cri&s;is of the conte&s;t had pa&s;&s;ed in this country, when he re&s;igned his command.</P>
<P>RETIREMENT to him was only a different mode of action, and his repo&s;e partook not of indolence. Amid&s;t the honourable pur&s;uits of agriculture, he di&s;charged various civil offices, until we find him ri&s;ing among&s;t the patriots of our country, as a delegate from Virginia, in the fir&s;t American Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>WE &s;hall ever remember the fifteenth day of June, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;eventy-five, when Providence directed to his appointment as the commander in chief of our revolutionary army. In this neighbourhood he fir&s;t drew his &s;word. Many of you, my Fellow-Town&s;men, were then langui&s;hing under the fetters of tyranny, or were impri&s;oned within the joyle&s;s confines of your own habitations. Your hope was fixed on him. His command, independent of the re&s;ources of his own mind, afforded no ground for the &s;upport of your feelings. He had an army brave indeed, but with
<PB N="11" REF="037967_0008_10102E5EC3344448">
little di&s;cipline; naked at the approach of winter; and almo&s;t &s;ubject to di&s;&s;olution from temporary enli&s;tments; a pay-ma&s;ter without money; a com|mi&s;&s;ary &s;truggling on the utmo&s;t &s;tretch of credit. A veteran army lay under his eye &s;trongly forti|fied, regularly paid, warmly clothed, and boa&s;ting its &s;uperiority to militia. Yet did his victorious &s;word relieve you, and &s;ave your city. Ju&s;tly have you a&s;cribed "your rein&s;tatement to his wi&s;e arrangements, which compelled your invaders to adopt a le&s;s de&s;tructive policy than that which on other occa&s;ions they &s;o wantonly practi&s;ed." Could our gratitude forget it, the heights around us bear the triumphant evidence of his conque&s;t.</P>
<P>To trace this protector of our liberties through his unrivalled career, from his gloomy retreat through the Jer&s;ies to his &s;everal victories and his &s;plendid triumph at York-Town, would be to narrate the varying hi&s;tory of our revolution. To him, public labour was amu&s;ement, &s;uffering in the cau&s;e of freedom was a luxury, and every hour as it flew carried an offering to his country.</P>
<P>As obedience to the voice of his oppre&s;&s;ed fel|low-citizens drew his &s;word on the approach of war, &s;o at the declaration of peace, by the &s;ame re&s;pected
<PB N="12" REF="037967_0009_10102E608FCB0F70">
voice he re&s;tored it to its &s;cabbard. He left them his ble&s;&s;ing and their liberties. O Human Nature, how ha&s;t thou been traduced! With thee, has it been &s;aid, is e&s;&s;entially connected that lu&s;t of power which is in&s;atiable; which re&s;tores not vol|untarily what has been committed to its charge; which devours all rights, and re&s;olves all laws into its own authority; which labours not for others, but &s;eizes the fruits of their labours for it&s;elf; which breaks down all barriers of religion, &s;oci|ety and nature that ob&s;truct its cour&s;e; now art thou vindicated! Here we behold thee allied to virtue, worn in the &s;ervice of mankind, &s;uperior to the meanne&s;s of compen&s;ation, humbly hoping for the thanks of thy country alone, faithfully &s;ur|rendering the &s;word, with which thou wa&s;t en|tru&s;ted, and yielding up power with a promptne&s;s and facility equalled only by the diffidence and re|luctance with which thou received&s;t it.</P>
<P>Now, will the future inquirer &s;ay, this Hero has fini&s;hed the ta&s;k a&s;&s;igned him, the mea&s;ure of his glory is full. A world is admitted to free|dom&mdash;a nation is born. Favoured beyond the leader of I&s;rael, not only with the pro&s;pect, but with the fruition of the promi&s;ed ble&s;&s;ing, he has
<PB N="13" REF="037967_0010_10102E625AAB1660">
retired, like that prince of meekne&s;s, to the <HI>Mount,</HI> whence he is to a&s;cend, un&s;een by a weeping people, to the reward of all his labours. No, he is to live another life upon this globe; he is to reap a double harve&s;t in the field of perennial honour. The peo|ple whom he has &s;aved from external tyranny, &s;uffer from the agitations of their own un&s;ettled powers. The tree of liberty which he has planted, and &s;o care|fully guarded from the &s;torms, now flouri&s;hes be|yond its &s;trength, its lofty excre&s;cences threaten to tear its le&s;s extended roots from the earth, and to pro&s;trate it fruitle&s;s on the plain. But, he comes! In Convention he pre&s;ides over coun&s;els, as in war he had led the battle. The Con&s;titution, like the rainbow after the flood, appears to us, now ju&s;t emerging from an overwhelming commotion; and we know the truth of the pledge from the &s;anction of his name.</P>
<P>THE production was worthy of its authors, and of the magnanimous people whom it was intended to e&s;tabli&s;h. You adopt it, you cheri&s;h it, and you re&s;olve to tran&s;mit it, with the name of WASH|INGTON, to the late&s;t generation, who &s;hall prove their ju&s;t claim to &s;uch an illu&s;trious de&s;cent.</P>
<P>WHO was &s;o worthy, as our great legi&s;lator, to direct the operations of a government which his
<PB N="14" REF="037967_0011_10102E642F7A3878">
coun&s;els and his &s;word had laboured to erect? By a unanimous &s;uffrage he was invited to the exalted &s;tation of Pre&s;ident of the United States. The call was too &s;acred to admit of doubt; It &s;uper&s;eded the happine&s;s of retirement, the demands of private intere&s;t, the &s;weet attractions of dome&s;tic &s;ociety, and the hazard (forgive it, WASHINGTON! for thou wa&s;t mortal) the hazard of public reputation. Behold the man on this occa&s;ion &s;o mighty in the eye of all the world, &s;o humble in his own! He accepts the high appointment with &s;uch di&s;tru&s;t of his natural endowments, with &s;uch diffidence in his capacity, as can be relieved only by his reliance on that almighty BEING, "who rules over the univer&s;e, who pre&s;ides in the councils of nations, and who&s;e providential aids can &s;upply every hu|man defect."</P>
<P>ONE of the earlie&s;t acts of his admini&s;tration was that circular vi&s;it to transfu&s;e his love, and receive the grateful benedictions of his loving countrymen, in which you, my Fellow Town&s;men, partook &s;o liberal a &s;hare. What &s;en&s;ations ru&s;h|ed upon your minds, when you compared the dreadful a&s;pect of your be&s;ieged city, with its now &s;miling condition. The well-cultivated fields were &s;creening from view the late terrific ramparts of
<PB N="15" REF="037967_0012_10102E6A35B79E10">
the enemy, and the groans of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed had yielded to the bu&s;y noi&s;e of commerce and plea&s;ure. How grateful now is the recollection, that with tears of joy you crowded to meet him in your &s;treets, di&s;playing the very in&s;ignia which you this day bear in mournful proce&s;&s;ion; and your children, bowing their heads with eager &s;olicitude to attract his fatherly eye, received his pious ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>DID the occa&s;ion admit of it, how plea&s;ing would be the review of his admini&s;tration, as our Supreme Executive Magi&s;trate! His talents and his virtues increa&s;ed with his cares. His &s;oul &s;eemed not to bear the limits of office, a moment after the obligations of duty and patrioti&s;m with|drew their re&s;traints from his univer&s;al love. When the mi&s;guided &s;avages of the wilderne&s;s, after feeling his cha&s;ti&s;ement, had &s;ued for peace, he &s;eemed to labour for their happine&s;s as the com|mon repre&s;entative of mankind. In&s;urrection was &s;o &s;truck at his countenance, that it fled from the &s;hock of his arms. Intrigue attempted to entan|gle him in her poi&s;onous web, but he bur&s;t it with gigantic &s;trength, and cru&s;hed&punc; her labours. An|archy looked out from her cavern, and was da&s;hed into oblivion, as we tru&s;t, forever. The nations
<PB N="16" REF="037967_0013_10102E6D54C74A48">
of Europe &s;aw the wi&s;dom of our laws, the vigour of our mea&s;ures, the ju&s;tice of our policy, the firm|ne&s;s of our government, and acquie&s;ced in the neutrality of our &s;tation.</P>
<P>THE dangers of the Commonwealth having &s;ub&s;ided at the clo&s;e of his &s;econd admini&s;tration, he felt him&s;elf ju&s;tified, after dedicating forty-five years of his valuable life to her &s;ervice, in with-drawing to receive with re&s;ignation the great change of nature, which his age and his toils dem|on&s;trated to be near. When he declined your fu|ture &s;uffrages, he left you a legacy. What! like Ce&s;ar's to the Romans, money for your &s;ports? Like Attalus's, a kingdom for your tyranny? No; he left you not &s;uch baubles, nor for &s;uch pur|po&s;es. He left you the records of wi&s;dom for your government: a mirror for the faithful rep|resentation to your own view, of your&s;elves, your weakne&s;&s;es, your advantages, your dangers: a magnet which points to the &s;ecret mines and windings of party &s;pirit, faction, foreign influ|ence: a pillar to the unity of your republic: a band to inclo&s;e, conciliate, and &s;trengthen the whole of your wonderful and almo&s;t boundle&s;s communities. Read, pre&s;erve the &s;acred depo&s;it;
<PB N="17" REF="037967_0014_10102E6EEE322818">
and le&s;t po&s;terity &s;hould forget the truth of its maxims, engrave them on his tomb, that they may read them when they weep before it.</P>
<P>IN his &s;econd re&s;ignation of power and the charms of office, the American Leader appears &s;uperior to ancient or modern examples. Yet another grade was a&s;&s;igned to his virtue. Our national rights, &s;o well defended at home, were invaded on the ocean. The alarm reaches his re|treat; the honour of our Republic warms his heart; and he again accepts the &s;word for its de|fence from the hand of another, placed by the voice of the people in that &s;upreme magi&s;tracy, which he alone had heretofore filled. With a le&s;s dignified &s;oul, this official inferiority might have availed to injure his country; but he who could de&s;cend from the head of a nation to di&s;charge the minute&s;t duties of a private citizen, was too great to allow the influence of etiquette to endan|ger the &s;afety of the people. His conde&s;cen&s;ion rai&s;es him above him&s;elf; his &s;pirit fires all ranks of men; he is overwhelmed with the gratitude and applau&s;e of an enraptured nation.</P>
<P>WHILST we confide in his arm, and are mar|&s;halling our warriors to march under his banners,
<PB N="18" REF="037967_0015_10102E7084593090">
the GOD of armies, who&s;e coun&s;els are beyond the &s;crutiny of man, prepares for us the te&s;t of our &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his cha&s;ti&s;ing rod. It is decreed that our WASHINGTON &s;hall die, but that his death &s;hall be worthy of his life. He is to die by the hand of Virtue. The rapid di&s;ea&s;e which is &s;elected as the in&s;trument of his di&s;&s;olution, in|&s;tantaneou&s;ly &s;eizes him. His humanity delays the immediate aid to which alone it may yield. Inconsolable Dome&s;tics! what &s;torms would you not have braved, what hazards would you not have encountered, to &s;ave that life which was &s;acrificed to your comfort and &s;afety! At length Science flies to &s;ave him. Alas! what avails its &s;kill again&s;t the mandate of Heaven? It comes too late!&mdash;It is fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>WONDERFUL event! Greatne&s;s departs in glory, and envy is &s;ilent! All acknowledge him to be the fir&s;t of citizens, and none feel hurt by his &s;uperiority. So impartial was he that none im|peach his ju&s;tice; &s;o moderate, none complain of his power; &s;o magnanimous, his conquered ene|mies applaud his humanity; &s;o philanthropic, that neither colour, nor climate, nor religion, nor poli|tics could exclude the unfortunate from his &s;uc|cour.
<PB N="19" REF="037967_0016_10102E75759DE420">
He had the habit of combining &s;entiment with action in &s;uch method and force, that he &s;hed his benevolence on communities of men with the &s;ame ea&s;e as the &s;udden impul&s;e of momentary &s;en|&s;ibility be&s;tows it upon individuals. Unexampled virtue! allotted to its merited reward. Many founders of nations have been left to obtain from po&s;terity that reputation which prejudice or big|otry has denied at their deaths. The tomb has been nece&s;&s;ary to bury anger, petty intere&s;ts and emulation, which barred an equitable judgment. But in regard to this Sage, the gratitude of his country has been co-exi&s;tent with his exertions. Time has not been required to remove him from our view, in order to magnify his exploits through the medium of &s;ame; nor was it requi&s;ite that we &s;hould be deprived of the good he had done us, to entertain a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of its importance. Medals and &s;tatues have been decreed him when living, and your tears announce his greater triumph in your hearts, when dead. Di&s;intere&s;ted love! What motives have you, freemen, for thus offer|ing up your applau&s;e? He has now no &s;hield to defend you from the inva&s;ions of your enemies; his head lies cold in the grave, and no coun&s;el can ari&s;e from his lips. His eyes were clo&s;ed by his
<PB N="20" REF="037967_0017_10102E78B6C20D18">
own un&s;haken hand, and no &s;mile can now beam from his countenance to animate your troops. Grateful Republicans! indeed you weep not from &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s. Afflicted with the thought of the ble&s;&s;|ings which he has &s;howered upon your&s;elves and your children, you would call him, could your voice be heard, from the clo&s;ed man&s;ions of the dead, again to receive the tribute of your affection. You weep for her, who&s;e tender participation in the anxieties of a hu&s;band relieved his cares, and protracted the invaluable life which love it&s;elf could no longer detain. Di&s;con&s;olate woman! mourn not, for the faithful is gone to receive the reward of his uprightne&s;s. The whole de&s;ire of his heart, the whole pur&s;uit of his labours has been the good of his fellow-men. Contra&s;t him with tho&s;e who have been rai&s;ed by the emp|ty, the criminal admiration of mankind, to the highe&s;t ranks in the Pantheon of fame. See one in&s;tead of liberating and protecting, employ|ed in conquering and en&s;laving a world, and weeping that his guilty ta&s;k could be contin|ued no longer. Another retiring from the purple, not with the united ble&s;&s;ings of all religious &s;ects, but the bigoted per&s;ecutor of the only rational and divine religion: See the ma&s;ter of &s;o many

crowns, after yielding them up for a convent, in|&s;tead of intere&s;ting him&s;elf in the welfare of man|kind to the hour of his departure, relap&s;ing into the ab&s;urdities of monki&s;h &s;uper&s;tition! and an|other, who&s;e a&s;hes are &s;carcely cold, &s;laughtering the armies of half the nations of Europe, to extend the limits of an Electorate, with as much zeal as our departed Hero laboured to extend the limits of freedom, civilization and morals. When &s;o much worth &s;teps off from the &s;tage of life, the weakne&s;s of our nature is the only apology for our tears. Such an exit is not death, it is the triumph of the ju&s;t.</P>
<P>SONS of Freedom! as you regard the memo|ry of your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;cended Chief, attend to the injunc|tions of his will. Remember that it was not for you alone he laboured. It was for your po&s;terity al&s;o; it was for the human race. For you and for them he was fir&s;t in building the noble&s;t polit|ical &s;y&s;tem that adorns the world. It is an experi|ment to a&s;certain the nature of man; whether he be capable of freedom, or whether he mu&s;t be led by the reins of tyranny; whether he be endow|ed with that moderation and under&s;tanding which checks the extreme indulgence of his will; and by allowing to others the &s;ame rational enjoyment

with him&s;elf, forms the liberty of the whole upon the partial re&s;traint of each individual; or wheth|er he mu&s;t go on attempting to follow the dictates of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and find his only re&s;traint in a pow|er which will e&s;tabli&s;h it&s;elf independent of his con|&s;ent, and make him its &s;lave. Who of us can be &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;o lo&s;t to him&s;elf, &s;o forgetful of his children, and &s;o traitorous to the world, as to con|template the overthrow of this magnificent tem|ple of wi&s;dom? No, my Fellow-Town&s;men, what|ever zeal may &s;uddenly &s;ugge&s;t, or apprehen&s;ions tempt us to &s;u&s;pect, there lives not a man among us, &s;o depraved, &s;o cur&s;ed by Heaven. Shall it be &s;aid, that the works of his hands whom we this day almo&s;t adore; that the hope which he held out to the nations of the earth, &s;hall be fru&s;trated by our divi&s;ions? To the honour of our country, not a man but an&s;wers, No: all, when rightly inform|ed, wave their particular prejudices in &s;upport of the great pillar of our national union. It is our pride; it was erected by our fathers; it is the &s;tandard of our defence. Let us then, with a view of forever maintaining it, bani&s;h all animo&s;ity, melt down all parties, wipe away all di&s;tinctions. Let us no longer de&s;ignate men who have differed in &s;enti|ment, by odious epithets mutually reflected and
<PB N="23" REF="037967_0020_10102E81EF0166C8">
mutually di&s;avowed: but if a common name be wanted, let it be formed from his whom we now &s;eek to honour, and let it be u&s;ed to denote good will to one another, re&s;pect to our Con&s;titution, fortitude to our enemies, love to our country, de|votion to our GOD.</P>
<P>IN the condolence of this day, we cannot fail to notice the honour which we feel by the pre&s;ence of the Fathers of the State. It was not unbecom|ing the dignity of office, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, to &s;u&s;pend its occupations and join the general &s;or|row. To devote this portion of time to his mem|ory who devoted a long life to our happine&s;s, is rational and ju&s;t. Within the pre&s;ent political year, you, Honourable Magi&s;trates and Legi&s;la|tors, in this place &s;olemnized the ob&s;equies of the late excellent Governor of our Commonwealth, the much re&s;pected SUMNER. Thus pa&s;s away the wi&s;e, the virtuous and the faithful; by an ir|revocable decree, le&s;s unwelcome to them, as it re&s;pects them&s;elves, than grievous to us. Their lives are long enough for their own glory, but, alas! &s;till too nece&s;&s;ary to their country's welfare. The experience, the learning, the genius, the vari|ous coincidence of circum&s;tances, which are nece&s;|&s;ary
<PB N="24" REF="037967_0021_10102E83DC2E91B0">
to form that effulgence of character, by which they enlighten, poli&s;h and direct &s;ociety, fall to the lot of few. When &s;uch lamps are extingui&s;h|ed, we are happy if our darkne&s;s be tran&s;ient. But in your wi&s;dom the people of our Commonwealth &s;afely confide; nor as members of our united country, do they mourn like tho&s;e who are with|out hope; for although in the pre&s;ent gloom of our political hemi&s;phere, their late ruling planet has travelled to the morning of another clime, yet its kindred luminary ri&s;es on the horizon, brilliant, &s;teady, and propitious to direct their cour&s;e. They lament that their beloved WASHINGTON &s;leeps in death; their con&s;olation is, that his faithful Brother, the vigilant ADAMS, &s;urvives.</P>
