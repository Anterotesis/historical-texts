</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the Words; there lies before us, [<HI>First</HI>] A Question, supposed, to be propounded, wherein there is two things: 1. The Questionists, <HI>this People, or a Prophet, or a Priest.</HI> 2. The Question it self, or the matter of it, <HI>What is the burden of the Lord? [Secondly]</HI> There is an Answer, and a solemn Answer too, which is put into his mouth by the Lord, and which he is to return as the Lords Answer to the Question? <HI>Thou shalt then say unto them, what burden?</HI> I <HI>will even forsake you, saith the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>In which Answer, there is three things, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> An expression of Indignation, <HI>what bur|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">.</HI></P>

2. An assertion by way of Answer to the que|stion, <HI>I will forsake you.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. A Seal of ratification, in the last words, <HI>Saith the Lord:</HI></P>
<P>God having before dealt with the Pastors, that did destroy, and scatter the flock, as in the be|ginning of the Chapter, <HI>Wo be to the Pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture,</HI> &amp; ver. 2. <HI>I will visit upon you the evil of your doings, saith the Lord, and also with the false Prophets, that pro|phesied lies in his Name,</HI> as ver. 9. <HI>My heart with|in me is broken because of the</HI> P<HI>rophets,</HI> &amp; ver. 32. <HI>Behold</HI> I <HI>am against them, that prorhesie false dreams, saith the Lord, and do tell them, and cause my People to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rre by their lies, and by their lightness:</HI> which sort of the prophets went without their com|mission, as <HI>ver.</HI> 21. <HI>I have not sent these</HI> P<HI>rophets yet they ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> He proceeds from the head Ru|lers, to the people that were seduced by them: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> by this means their hands were strengthened in sin, so as that they did not return fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> their wickedness, as <HI>ver.</HI> 14. It was a usual thing for the Prophets of the Lord, to begin their Ser|mons (the matter whereof was minatory, where|in the Lord threatned them with just judge|ments) with that Phrase, <HI>the burden of the Lord,</HI> as will easily appear if you consult, <HI>Isai.</HI> 13. 1. &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">5. 1. &amp; 22. 1. &amp; 30. 6.

<P><PB N="3" REF="039221_0008_1013F8D523DF3658">
For the opening of the words, <HI>And:</HI> or more|over, because he here enters upon new matter: <HI>this people,</HI> or the prophane sort of them, whom the false Prophets had seduced, to which he joyns the Prophet and the Priest, in that they were alike prophane, as <HI>ver.</HI> 11. <HI>For both Prophet and Priest are prophane, yea in my house,</HI> saith the Lord: and when Prophets are prophane, there is wont to be a pack of them, as <HI>Jer.</HI> 5. 31. <HI>The Prophets prophesie falsly, and the</HI> P<HI>riests bear rule by their meanes, and my people love to have</HI> it <HI>so:</HI> shall ask thee saying, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> in a deriding way, not out of a holy end or desire, <HI>What is the burden of the Lord? or from the Lord?</HI> So were the Prophe|sies stiled, that contained in them, <HI>Threatnings, Judgements and Plagues,</HI> 2 King. 9. 25. As if they had said, what hast thou further mischief in thy head to declare? further woes and threatnings to pronounce? hast thou nothing else to prophesie but Mischief and Calamity? <HI>What is the burden now? Thou shalt then say unto them,</HI> the Lord knew what they would say to him, and tells him what he should say, by way of reply, <HI>What burden?</HI> a retorting, by way of holy indignation; ask ye indeed <HI>what burden?</HI> and that in away of deri|sion, are you of that strain and spirit?

your haughty Spirits, when this <HI>Burden</HI> shall come upon you, in its force and weight.</P>
<P>Doctr. <HI>That the Lord may even forsake a</HI> P<HI>eople, that have been near to him, and He hath been near to; though for the Lord thus to do, is as fearfull and hideous a judgement as can be in|flicted on any</HI> P<HI>eople.</HI></P>
<P>The Doctrine is double, it hath two parts.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That the Lord may do thus.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> When He doth, it is a very sad and heavy burden, <HI>I</HI>t may be prosecuted as two di|stinct points.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. God may forsake a People that hath been near to him, and that he hath been near to. This may be spoken to in this order.</ITEM>

<P N="1">1. What doth Gods forsaking mean? what is intended thereby?</P>
<P>Sol&punc; It means Gods with-drawing himself, as the Prophet <HI>Hosea</HI> phraises it, <HI>Hos.</HI> 5. 6. <HI>They shall go with their Flocks and their Herds to seek the Lord, but shall not find him, he hath withdrawn himself from the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">.</HI> They shall seek him, and not find him, and there is a good reason, he hath
<PB N="5" REF="039221_0010_1013F8D9451C49E0">
withdrawn himself, he is gone, in respect of his gracious presence. We must here distinguish betwixt Gods general presence, and his precious presence. In respect of his general presence, he is not far from any one of us, <HI>for in him we live, and move, and have our being, Act</HI> 17.27.28. We have not only our beginning from, but our being in him&punc; As the beam hath its being in the Sun. Of the general presence of God, we read, <HI>Psal.</HI> 139.7. There is no flying from it, <HI>Whither shall</HI> I <HI>go from thy</HI> S<HI>pirit, or whither shall I flie from thy presence?</HI> In this sense God is every where; as it is <HI>ver:</HI> 8: &amp; 9. <HI>If I ascend up into Heaven thou art there: if I make my bid in Hell, behold thou art there.</HI> He fills Heaven and Earth, and there is no hiding from him, <HI>Jer.</HI> 23. 24. <HI>Can any hide himself in secret places, that I shall not see him? saith the Lord, do not I fill Heaven and Earth? saith the Lord.</HI> He hath Heaven for his Throne, and the Earth for his Footstool, as it is I<HI>sai.</HI> 66. 1. This general presence of God, if believingly apprehended, and strongly be|lieved, might be of great use.</P>
<P>But it is not this general presence that is meant: but his especial presence, his favourable and gra|cious presence, the removing whereof, is that that is intended, by the forsaking that the Text and Point speaks of. God is said to forsake a People two wayes.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. As to Affection.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. As to Action.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1"><PB N="6" REF="039221_0011_1013F8DD74844A48">
1. As to Affection, when He discontinues his love to them, when he takes away his love from a people, then He takes his leave of a people. <HI>My mind is not toward this people,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">er. 15.1, a very heavy judgement, and sad removal. Be <HI>instructed O</HI> Jerusalem, <HI>least my</HI> S<HI>oul depart from thee:</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. As to Action, when God takes away the signs of his presence.</P>
<P>As when he takes away merciful and gracious Providences, when he carries not towards them as he was wont to do: but vexes them with all manner of adversity, <HI>Deut.</HI> 31.17. I <HI>will forsake them, and many evils and troubles shall befall them:</HI> when he ceases to protect them from evils and enemies, as in times past, and provides not for them, as he was wont to do. When he takes away his Ordinances, and bereaves a people of the glorious things of his house, or take a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> his Spirit from accompanying them, whereby the glory ceases, and the Ordinances are ren|dered in-effectual for the saving good of a peo|ple.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>How it may appear that God may forsake such a people?</HI></P>
<P>It may appear by what God hath threatened. What God hath threatened, to such as the point speaks of, may be inflicted on them: but God hath threatened such judgements to such a peo|ple. <HI>My anger shall be kindled against them&punc;
<PB N="7" REF="039221_0012_1013F8DEFA349AB0">
and I will forsake them,</HI> as near as they are to me, and as dear as they have been to me, <HI>Deut.</HI> 31. 17, Many such threatnings are found in the Scripture against <HI>Israel,</HI> who are stiled a people near unto him.</P>
<P>In that such as have been near to God, and he near to them, have complained of their being forsaken by God. <HI>Thou hast forsaken us,</HI> is one of the bitter moans, on record, that the Church of God did often make unto him.</P>
<P>What God hath inflicted on such, may be in|flicted on such again; what God hath done to some, he may do to others in the same state, and relation: for he is Unchangeable. Those that were once the only peculiar people of God, near to God, and had God near to them; yet what is their condition at this day? A forsaken condi|tion, is the condition of the Offspring of <HI>Abra|ham,</HI> Gods Friend, a seed whom he had chosen, and hath been so, for above sixteen hundred yeares. God hath been angry with them, and forsaken them, as they were foretold long ago&punc; How is it with the Churches of <HI>Asia,</HI> that were once famous golden Candlesticks? that had E|pistles written to them. Are they not in a for|saken condition? not the face of a Church to be found amongst them.</P>
<P>In that they may do that, which may deserve a forsaking, therefore they may do that which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> actually procure it. They may do that
<PB N="8" REF="039221_0013_1013F8E0AD19E9E8">
which may deserve a forsaking, they may through the corruption and unbelief of their hearts for|sake God, and God may in just judgement reta|liate, and thereupon forsake them: This is spo|ken to, in the forequoted place, <HI>Deut.</HI> 31. 16,17. <HI>They will forsake me, and break my Covenant which I have made with them: then my anger shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e kindled against them in that day, and I will for|sake them, and hide my face from them.</HI> So again, 2. Chron. 15. 2. <HI>But if you forsake him he will for|sake you;</HI> the first is supposed, <HI>if you forsake him,</HI> the latter is imposed, <HI>he will forsake you;</HI></P>
<P>But why doth the Lord forsake such a People? The Reasons:</P>
<P N="1">1. To shew that he hath no need of any, he hath forsaken many, and may forsake many more, to shew that he hath no need of any. God would have all are world to take notice, (that though all m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of him, yet) he hath no need of any man.</P>
<P N="2">2. To testifi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> his Sanctity, and severity against sin. He will not spare them, that have been near him, if they will not spare their sin for him. He is a holy God, and if they will have their sins, and their lusts, and their wayes, and their lovers, he will vindicate his holiness, by inflicting this judgement on them.</P>
<P N="3">3. To be a warning to all that injoy his gra|cious presence. That they see that they make much of it, and that they take heed that they
<PB N="9" REF="039221_0014_1013F8E3605B9990">
do no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> sin against him, and forsake him and pro|voke him to forsake them also.</P>
<P><HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">.</HI> The point is to be understood of a peo|ple that are visibly and externally near and dear to him, and these may be totally and finally for|saken of God: and yet here it must be noted, that God may exercise a deal of patience, and forbearance toward such as he is about to forsake, he did so with the old world, he did so with the <HI>Israelites</HI> of old, he did so with the seven Chur|ches of <HI>Asia:</HI> he did not wont suddenly, and at once to forsake a People, that have been near and dear to him; but he is wont to give them warn|ing, and in patience to bear a while with their frowardness, and wait to see if there be any re|turning to him, before he doth inflict this heavy and sharp judgement.</P>
<P><HI>Use</HI> It serves to admonish us, not to bear our selves too high, upon the account of Priviledges&punc; It is a great priviledge to have the Lord near us, and to be near unto him: and some lean upon this though they abide in their sin, <HI>Micah</HI> 3. 10. 11. <HI>They build up</HI> S<HI>ion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity, yet will they lean upon the Lord, and say, is not the Lord amongst us?</HI> But if our de|portments be not according to our priviledges, if we do not carry it: thereafter, by becoming an humble, fruitfull, and holy people; the Lord will bring forth this heavy burden against us, we shall be rejected, and forsaken of the Lord, what|ever
<PB N="10" REF="039221_0015_1013F8E783E302A8">
our external priviledges be&punc;</P>
<P>But the second part of the Doctrine; or the second Doctrine may be now spoken to, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P><HI>That it is the heaviest burden, or the sorest of Judgements for the Lord to forsake a people.</HI></P>
<P>There may be two things spoken to in the ma|nagement of this Truth. 1. Arguments to e|vidence it. 2. The Uses of it.</P>
<P N="1">1. If God hath threatened it as a very sore judgement, then sure it is so. Now when God hath been angry with a people, he hath manifest|ed the same by menacing them with his forsaking them: when he hath been designed to do them a deep displeasure, upon the account of some high provocation, he is wont to threaten them&punc; not by taking away this, or that outward comfort from them; but by taking away himself from them.</P>
<P>And that is a woe indeed, a woe with a witness, <HI>Hos.</HI> 9. 12. Yea, woe also to them when I depart from them: this is the wofullest day that such a people are wont to meet with.</P>
<P N="2">2. Gods forsaking a People is a sore judge|ment, in that it exposes them to all judgements, Sin is a great evil, in that it exposes to all evil, this is a great evil of punishment, in that it exposes to all punishments. If God be gone, our guard is gone, and we are as a Cit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y, in the midst of E|nemies, whose walls are broken down. Our strength to make resistance, that is gone, for God
<PB N="11" REF="039221_0016_1013F8E907D99138">
is our strength, as a carcase with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, is a prey, to beasts of prey; so are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> forsa|ken of their God, to all their devouring enemies, and to infernal, and cursed spirits: they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">re ex|posed to mischief, and the malice of all their ma|lignant enemies. When the Lord had forsaken <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> the <HI>Romans,</HI> quickly made a prey of it; when they were destitute of God, their habita|tion became desolate. There is no Protection to a People, whom the Lord forsakes; but they are perplexed on every side.</P>
<P N="3">3. Because the evils that are on such, whom God hath forsaken, they are only evils. The Prophet <HI>Ezekiel</HI> sometime<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> hath the expression, <HI>Ezek</HI> 7. 5. <HI>Thus saith the Lord God, an evil, an only evil behold is come.</HI> This is such an evil, an only evil to a people. An evil whilst God is present, may have much good in it, the Lord may sancti|fie it for abundance of blessing; there is hopes of this whilst the Lord continues amongst them; but if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> gone, it is an only evil, and the evils that come upon them are such they have no|thing but evil in them.</P>
<P N="4">4. Because no creatures can then afford any help; for what can creatures do when God is departed, he makes the creatures useful and help|ful, but without him they can do us no good, stand us in no stead: they may say to thee as the King of <HI>Israel,</HI> said to the Woman, that cried <HI>Help O King,</HI> He answered, <HI>If the Lord don't
<PB N="12" REF="039221_0017_1013F8EB8922F958">
help, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> shall I help thee?</HI> all creatures may say if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eparted, <HI>we cannot help:</HI> Nor the very Devil <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> help if God be gone: when God departed from <HI>Saul,</HI> he sought help from the Devil, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 28. 15. <HI>Wherefore</HI> (saith the Devil) <HI>askest thou of me? seeing the Lord is de|parted from thee.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. It appears to be a sore judgement, by the an|guish and distress, that such have been in, that have been sensible that God hath forsaken them. <HI>S</HI>in hath flowen in the face of such, and terrified them: On the blessed God is gone, and if he is gone, mercy is gone; and Oh for such and such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">es, that lie upon me! what shall I do? what a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">oan have Saints themselves made in such a case? as <HI>David,</HI> Psal 22. 1. 2. <HI>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far from helping me? and from the words of my roaring?

<P N="6">6. It is a sore punishment, in that it is a great part of the punishment of Hell. The essential parts of that punishment, is pain of loss and sense,

<P N="2">2. Se here what an evil it is to forsake God, is it a judgement of judgements to be forsaken of God? surely then it is the sin of sins to for|sake him: the evil of punishment is in being left by God, and the evil of sin is in leaving God: What, forsake God, who is our only good?

we pull down this judgement on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> heads. Men should be afraid of this heaviest of judgements; more then the Child is of whipping.</P>
<P N="5">5. Let Gods dear ones take heed of conclud|ing against themselves, that they are under this judgement. They are rediest to conclude against themselves, and yet really in the least danger: Thus we read, I<HI>sa.</HI> 49: 14. <HI>But Zion said, the</HI> L<HI>ord hath forsaken me, and my</HI> L<HI>ord hath forgot|ten me.</HI> But why said <HI>Zion</HI> so? it was from diffi|dence: as Saints do not forsake God as others do, <HI>Psal.</HI> 18. 21. I <HI>have not wickedly departed from my</HI> God: so God will nor forsake them as he forsakes others, not utterly forsake them. His forsaking of his is but temporary and partial.</P>
<P>But here a Question may be moved, <HI>What is the difference between a sinner forsaken, and a Saint forsaken?</HI> for the Lord doth not forsake both a|like.</P>
<P N="1">1. When God forsakes his own, yet they cry after him, He withdraws himself from them sometimes, yet so as that he draws their hearts after him as a Mother may hide away from her Child, that it may seek &amp; cry the more earnestly after <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P N="2">2. They retain good thoughts of him in his withdrawment, or absence.

<P N="3">3. They will seek him, till he return again, when the Lord forsakes others, they will seek after vanities, to make up the want of Gods presence. The Adultress in her Husbands absence, will-seek after other lovers. The true Saint will be satis|fied in nothing else but the Lord till he return. Moreover there is a difference in Gods forsaking the sinner, and the Saint, when he forsakes the wicked they are left in darkness: but when he withdraws from his own he leaves some light, whereby they see which way he is gone, he leaves some glimmering light, by which they may fol|low after him, and find him.</P>
<P>And again, when he leaves his own, yet his bowels are towards them, <HI>Jer.</HI> 31. 20 <HI>My bow|els are troubled for him, I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the Lord.</HI> He hath an eye to|wards them for much good, in his forsaking them.</P>
<P><HI>Use.</HI> 2. Of <HI>Exhortation:</HI> 1. To thankful|ness to God, for that he hath not yet forsaken us. Whatever he hath stript us of, he hath not yet stript us of himself, he hath not as yet forsaken us. He might have done it, and have done us no wrong; but he hath not yet done it&punc;</P>

us. And here there may be added Mothers, and&punc; Means.</P>
<P N="1">1. Consider Gods lothness to forsake us. This is a thing that he is not desirous of, he doth not willingly afflictus with this sort of Affliction, or grieve us with this grievous stroak. God hath shewed himself loth to depart from those that have departed from him; but have warned them of his displeasure, that they might stay him. It goes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ear Gods heart to forsake a People that have been near to him. Me thinks I hear him saying thus, <HI>How shall I give thee up, Oh New-England!</HI> Thence speaking to warn us, of our forsaking of him, and be instructed, why? least his Spirit depart from us, <HI>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">r.</HI> 6. 8. <HI>Be thou instructed Oh Jerusalem, least my Soul depart from thee, least I make thee desolate a land not inhabit|ed.</HI> You may easily stay him, the matter is not so far gone, but you might yet stay him: were we but as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> should forsake us, as he is to forsake us, he would never leave us. His gradual mo|tions from a people, argue his lothness, and un|willingness to leave them.</P>
<P N="2">2. Consider what the Lord is to us, of what relation he stands in to us, while he is with us. He is our friend, we have found him to be so, and a special friend too: men in the World ate not willing to forego a Friend, a good Friend: He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> as faithfull, skilfull, powerfull, and tender&punc; heart|ed a Friend, as ever a people had, he stuck by us

when also we had been in a woe ease, <HI>Psal.</HI> 124. 2. <HI>If it had not been the Lord, who was on our side, may Israel now say.</HI> And had not the Lord been on our side, may <HI>New-England</HI> now say.

If he leave us, we shall be as Orphans, for he is related as a Father, and how sad is the state of poor Orphans: and we shall be in a state of Widdow-hood, a very soli|tary, and sorrowfull state. He is our <HI>Guide</HI> and our <HI>Pilot;</HI> what will become of the blind if their guide leave them? and what will become of the Ship if the Pilot desert it?

<P N="3">3. Consider there are shrewd signs of Gods intent to leave us, unless somewhat be done.</P>
<P>If you enquire what? I Answer:</P>

<P N="2">2. Another sign of his intent to leave us, is, <HI>in that he is dealing with us as he is wont to deal with them that he is about to forsake.</HI> He takes away those that are mostly with him. He will take away his <HI>Moses's,</HI> those that stand in the gap, and binds his hands with their prayers, when he is designed to pour out wrath upon a People; he will remove the lights, when he is about to darken a land.

<P N="3">3. Another sign is, our <HI>Luke-warmness,</HI> and <HI>Indifferency in Religion:</HI> a usual fore-runner of its removal. When a People care not for God and the things of God, he hath left them in some measure already; and if that spirit abide, he will not tarry long with them.</P>
