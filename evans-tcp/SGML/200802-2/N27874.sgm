<HEAD>THE WAY TO PLENTY, OR, THE HISTORY OF TOM WHITE. [CONCLUDED.]</HEAD>
<P>I THANK you for the hint, &s;ir, &s;aid the farmer, "I am re&s;olved to rejoice though, and others &s;hall rejoice with me: And we will have a merry night on't."</P>
<P>So Mrs. White dre&s;&s;ed a very plentiful &s;upper of meat and pudding; and &s;pread out two tables. The farmer &s;at at the head of one, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ome of the neighbours, and all his work-people. At the other &s;at his wife, with two long bench|es on each &s;ide of her. At the&s;e &s;at all the old and infirm poor, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who lived in the workhou&s;e, and had no day of fe&s;tivity to look forward to in the whole year but this. On the gra&s;s, in the little court, &s;at the children of his la|bourers, and of the other poor, who&s;e employment it had been to gather flow|ers, and dre&s;s and adorn the horns of the
<PB N="3" REF="037139_0003_100C93A78502CA88" MS="y">
ram; for the farmer did not wi&s;h to put an end to any old cu&s;tom, if it was inno|cent. His own children &s;tood by the ta|ble, and he gave them plenty of pudding, which they carried to the children of the poor, with a little draught of cider to every one.</P>
<P>This fea&s;t though orderly and decent, was yet hearty and cheerful. Dr. Shep|herd dropped in with a good deal of com|pany he had at his hou&s;e, and they were much plea&s;ed. When the Doctor &s;aw how the aged and the infirm poor were enjoying them&s;elves, he was much moved; he &s;hook the farmer by the hand, and &s;aid, "But thou, when thou make&s;t a fea&s;t, call the blind, and the lame, and the halt; they cannot recompence thee, but thou &s;halt be recompen&s;ed at the re&s;urrection of the ju&s;t."</P>
<P>"Sir," &s;aid the farmer, "'tis no great matter of expence, I kill a &s;heep of my own, potatoes are as plenty as blackber|ries, with people who have a little fore|thought. I &s;ave much more cider in the cour&s;e of a year by never allowing any carou&s;ing in my kitchen, or drunkenne&s;s
<PB N="4" REF="037139_0004_100C93A911653F40">
in my fields, than would &s;upply many &s;uch fea&s;ts as the&s;e, &s;o that I &s;hall be ne|ver the poorer at Chri&s;tmas. It is cheap|er to make people happy, &s;ir, than to make them drunk. The Doctor and the ladies conde&s;cended to walk from one table to the other, and heard many mer|ry &s;tories, but not one profane word, or one indecent &s;ong; &s;o that he was not forced to the painful nece&s;&s;ity either of reproving them, or leaving them in anger. When all was over they &s;ung the &s;ixty-fifth p&s;alm, and the ladies all joined in it, and when they got home to the vicarage to tea, they declared they liked it better than any concert.</P>

<HEAD>The HARD WINTER.</HEAD>
<P>In the famous cold winter of the pre|&s;ent year, 1795, it was edifying to &s;ee how patiently farmer White bore that long and &s;evere fro&s;t. Many of his &s;heep were frozen to death, but he thanked GOD that he had &s;till many left. He continu|ed to find in-door work that his men might not be out of employ. Mrs. White was &s;o con&s;iderate, that ju&s;t at that time &s;he le&s;&s;ened the number of her hogs, that
<PB N="5" REF="037139_0005_100C93AB32897448">
&s;he might have more whey and &s;kim milk to a&s;&s;i&s;t poor families. Nay, I have known her live on boiled meat for a long while together, in a &s;ickly &s;ea&s;on, be|cau&s;e the pot-liquor made &s;uch a &s;upply of broth for the &s;ick poor. As the &s;pring came on, and things grew wor&s;e, &s;he ne|ver had a cake, a pye, or a pudding in her hou&s;e; though &s;he u&s;ed to have plen|ty of the&s;e good things, and will again I hope when the pre&s;ent &s;carcity is over; though &s;he &s;ays &s;he never will u&s;e &s;uch white flour again, even if it &s;hould come down to five &s;hillings a bu&s;hel.</P>
<P>All the pari&s;h now began to murmur. Farmer Jones was &s;ure the fro&s;t had killed the wheat. Farmer Wil&s;on &s;aid the rye would never come up. Brown the malt&s;ter in&s;i&s;ted the barley was dead at the root. Butcher Jobbins &s;aid beef would be a &s;hilling a pound. All decla|red there would not be a hop to brew with. The orchards were all blighted, there would not be apples enough to make a pye; and as to hay there would be none to be had for love nor money.
<Q>I'll tell you what, &s;aid farmer White, the &s;ea|&s;on is dreadful.</Q>
The crops are unpro|mi&s;ing
<PB N="6" REF="037139_0006_100C93ACE689C8A0">
ju&s;t now; but 'tis too early to to judge. Don't let us make things wor&s;e than they are. We ought to comfort the poor, and you are driving them to de&s;|pair. Don't you know how much GOD was di&s;plea&s;ed with the murmurs of his cho&s;en people? And yet, when they were tired of manna he &s;ent them quails; but all did not do. Nothing &s;atisfies grum|blers. We have a promi&s;e on our &s;ide, that there &s;hall be &s;eed time and harve&s;t time to the end. Let us then hope for a good day, but provide again&s;t an evil one. Let us rather prevent the evil before it is come upon us, than &s;ink under it when it comes. Grumbling can't help us. Acti|vity can. Let us &s;et about planting pota|toes in every nook and corner, in ca&s;e the corn <HI>should</HI> fail, which however I don't believe. Let us mend our management before we are driven to it by actual want. And if we allow our hone&s;t labourers to plant a few potatoes for their families in the head lands of our plowed fields, or other wa&s;te bits of ground, it will do us no harm, and be a great help to them."</P>
<P>The farmer had many temptations to end his corn at an extravagant price to
<PB N="7" REF="037139_0007_100C93AF99F5C080">
a <HI>certain sea port town;</HI> but as he knew that it was intended to export it again&s;t law, he would not be tempted to encou|rage unlawful gain; &s;o he thre&s;hed out a &s;mall mow at a time, and &s;old it to the neighbouring poor far below the market price. He &s;erved his own workmen fir&s;t. This was the &s;ame to them as if he had rai&s;ed their wages, and even  better, as it was a benefit of which their families were f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e to partake. If the poor in the next pari&s;h were more di&s;tre&s;&s;ed than his own, he &s;old to them at the &s;ame rate. "For," &s;aid he, "there is no di&s;tinction of pa|ri&s;hes in heaven, and though charity begins at home, yet it ought not to end there."</P>
<P>He had been u&s;ed in good times now and then to catch a hare or a partridge, as he was qualified. But he now re&s;olved to give up that plea&s;ure. So he parted from a couple of &s;paniels he had; for he could not bear that his dogs &s;hould be eat|ing the meat, or the milk which &s;o many men, women, and children wanted.</P>

<HEAD>The WHITE LOAF.</HEAD>
<P>ONE day, it was about the middle of July, 1795 when things &s;eemed to be at the
<PB N="8" REF="037139_0008_100C93B1F0DE1DD8">
deare&s;t, and the Rulers of the land had agreed to &s;et the example of eating no|thing but coar&s;e bread. Doctor Shepherd read, before &s;ermon, in the church their public declaration, which the magi&s;trates of the county &s;ent him, and had al&s;o &s;ign|ed them&s;elves. Mrs. White of cour&s;e was at church, and commended it mighti|ly. Next morning the Doctor took a walk over to the farmer's, in order to &s;ettle further plans for the relief of the pari&s;h. He was much &s;urpri&s;ed to meet Mrs. White's little maid Sally with a ve|ry &s;mall white loaf, which &s;he had been buying at a &s;hop. He &s;aid nothing to the girl, as he never thought it right to expo&s;e the faults of a mi&s;tre&s;s to her &s;er|vant; but walked on, re&s;olving to give Mrs. White a &s;evere lecture for the fir&s;t time in his life. He &s;oon changed his mind, for on going into the kitchen the fir&s;t per&s;on he &s;aw was Tom the thatcher, who had had a &s;ad fall from a ladder; his arm, which was &s;lipped out of his &s;leeve, was &s;welled in a frightful manner. Mrs. White was &s;tanding at the dre&s;&s;er making the little white loaf into a poultice, which &s;he laid upon the &s;welling in a large clean old cloth.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="037139_0009_100C93B38129F170">"I a&s;k your pardon, my good Sarah," &s;aid the Doctor, "I ought not, however appearances were again&s;t you, to have &s;u&s;pected that &s;o humble and prudent a woman as you are, would be led either to indulge any daintine&s;s of your own, or to fly in the face of your betters, by eat|ing white bread while they are eating brown. Whenever I come here I &s;ee it is not needful to be rich in order to be charitable. A bountiful rich man would have &s;ent Tom to a &s;urgeon who would have done no more good for him than you have done; for in tho&s;e inflammations the mo&s;t &s;kilful &s;urgeon could only apply a poultice. Your kindne&s;s in dre&s;&s;ing the wound your&s;elf, will, I doubt not, per|form the cure at the expence of that three-penny loaf and a little hog's lard. And I will take care that Tom &s;hall have a a good &s;upply of Rice from the Sub&s;crip|tion." "And he &s;han't want for &s;kim milk," &s;aid Mrs. White, and was he the be&s;t lord in the land, in the &s;tate he is in, a di&s;h of good rice milk would be better for him than the riche&s;t meat.</P>

<HEAD>The PARISH MEETING.</HEAD>
<P>ON the tenth of Augu&s;t the ve&s;try held another meeting, to con&s;ult on the be&s;t method of further a&s;&s;i&s;ting the poor. The pro&s;pect of abundant crops now cheered every heart. Farmer White had a mind to be a little jocular with his de&s;ponding neighbours. Well, neighbour Jones," &s;aid he, "all the wheat was killed, I &s;up|po&s;e. The barley all dead at the root. Farmer Jones looked &s;heeepi&s;h, and &s;aid, to be &s;ure the crops had turned out better than he thought, Then," &s;aid Dr. Shep|herd, learn to tru&s;t Providence another time."</P>
<P>Among other things, they agreed to &s;ub&s;cribe for a large quantity of rice, which was to be &s;old out to the poor at a ve|ry low price, and Mrs. White was &s;o kind as to undertake the trouble of &s;elling it. After their day's work was over, all who wi&s;hed to buy at the&s;e reduced rates were ordered to come to the farm on the Tue&s;|day evening. Dr. Sepherd dropped in at the &s;ame time, and when Mrs. White had done weighing her rice, the Doctor &s;poke as follows:</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="037139_0011_100C93BB9E2F0148">"My hone&s;t friends, it has plea&s;ed GOD to vi&s;it this land with a &s;carcity, to which we have been little accu&s;tomed. There are &s;ome idle evil minded people who are on the watch for public di&s;tre&s;&s;|es, not that they may humble them&s;elves under the mighty hand of GOD, (which is the true u&s;e to be made of all troubles) but that they may benefit them&s;elves by di&s;turbing the public peace. The&s;e peo|ple, by riot and drunkenne&s;s, double the evil which they pretend to cure. Riot will compleat our misfortune, while peace, indu&s;try, and good management, will go near to cure them. Bread to be &s;ure is uncommonly dear. Among the various ways of making it cheaper, one is to re|duce the quality of it, another, to le&s;&s;en the quantity we con&s;ume. If we cannot get enough of coar&s;e wheaten bread, let us mix one half of potatoes, and one half of wheat. This la&s;t is what I eat in my own family. It is plea&s;ant and whole|&s;ome. Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour ate barley bread you know, as we were told in one of the Numbers of the Cheap Repo&s;itory, which I hope you have all heard; as I de&s;ired the ma&s;ter of the Sunday &s;chool to read it ju&s;t after even|ing
<PB N="12" REF="037139_0012_100C93BD8C53A3C0">
&s;ervice, when I know many of the parents are apt to call in at the &s;chool. This is a good cu&s;tom, and one of tho&s;e little books &s;hall be often read at that time.</P>
<P>"My good women, I truly feel for you at this time of &s;carcity; and I am going to &s;hew my good will, as much by my advice as my &s;ub&s;cription. It is my duty, as your friend and mini&s;ter, to tell you, that one half of your pre&s;ent hard|&s;hips is owing to BAD MANAGEMENT. I often meet your children without &s;hoes and &s;tockings, with great luncheons of the very white&s;t bread, and that three times a day. Half that quantity, and &s;till le&s;s if it were coar&s;e, put into a di&s;h of good onion or leek porridge, would make them an excellent breakfa&s;t. Ma|ny too of the very poore&s;t of you eat your bread hot from the oven; this makes the difference of one loaf in five; I a&s;|&s;ure you 'tis what I cannot afford to do. Come Mrs. White, you mu&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t me a little. I am not very knowing in the&s;e matters my&s;elf&punc; but I know that the rich would be twice as charitable, if the poor made a better u&s;e of their bounty. Mrs.
<PB N="13" REF="037139_0013_100C93BF9030D238">
White do give the&s;e poor women a little advice how to make their pittance go further than it now does. When you li|ved with me you were famous for making us nice, cheap di&s;hes, and I dare &s;ay you are not le&s;s notable now you manage for your&s;elf."</P>
<P>"Indeed neighbours, &s;aid Mrs. White, what the good doctor &s;ays is very true. A halfpenny worth of oatmeal or groats&punc; with a leek or onion, out of your own garden which co&s;ts nothing, a bit of &s;alt, and a little coar&s;e bread, will breakfa&s;t your whole family. It is a great mi&s;take at any time to think a bit of meat &s;o ruinous, and a great loaf of bread &s;o cheap. A poor man gets &s;even or eight &s;hillings a week; if he is careful he bring's it home. I dare not &s;ay how much of this goes for tea in the afternoon, now &s;ugar and butter are &s;o dear, becau&s;e I &s;hould have you all upon me, but, I will &s;ay that too much of this little goes even for bread, from a notion that it is the harde&s;t fare. This at all times, but particularly ju&s;t now, is bad management. Dry pea&s;e to be &s;ure have been very dear lately! but now they are plenty enough. I am
<PB N="14" REF="037139_0014_100C93C1782FBE48">
certain then, that if a &s;hilling or two of the &s;even or eight was laid out for a bit of coar&s;e beef, a &s;heep's head, or any &s;uch thing, it would be well be&s;towed. I would throw a couple of pounds of this into the pot with two or three handfuls of grey pea&s;e, an onion, and a little pepper. Then I would throw in cabbage, or turnip, and carrot; or any garden &s;tuff that was mo&s;t plenty; and let it &s;tew two or three hours, and it will make a di&s;h &s;it for his Maje&s;ty. The working man &s;hould have the meat: the children don't want it, the &s;oup will be thick and &s;ub&s;tantial, and requires no bread.</P>

<HEAD>RICE MILK.</HEAD>
<P>"You who can get &s;kim milk, as all our workmen can, have a great advan|tage. A quart of this, and a quarter of a pound of the rice you have ju&s;t bought, a little bit of all-&s;pice, and brown &s;ugar, will make a dainty and a cheap di&s;h."</P>
<P>"Ble&s;s your heart!" muttered Amy Grum|ble, who looked as dirty as a cinder-wench with her face and fingers all daubed with &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uff; "rice milk indeed!" it is very
<PB N="15" REF="037139_0015_100C93C368075468">
nice to be &s;ure for tho&s;e who can dre&s;s it, but we have not a bit of coal; rice is of no u&s;e to us without firing." "And yet," &s;aid the Doctor, "I &s;ee your tea-kettle boiling twice every day, as I pa&s;s by the poor-hou&s;e, and fre&s;h butter at eleven-pence a pound on your &s;helf." "O dear, &s;ir," cried Amy, "a few &s;ticks &s;erve to boil the tea-kettle." "And a few more," &s;aid the Doctor," will boil the rice milk, and give twice the nouri&s;h|ment at a quarter of the expence."</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>RICE PUDDING.</HEAD>
<P>"PRAY <HI>Sarah,</HI>" &s;aid the Doctor, "how did you u&s;e to make that pudding my children were &s;o fond of? And I remem|ber when it was cold, we u&s;ed to have it in the parlour for &s;upper." "Nothing more ea&s;y," &s;aid Mrs. White. "I put half a pound of rice, two quarts of &s;kim milk, and two ounces of brown &s;ugar." "Well," &s;aid the Doctor, "and how ma|ny will this dine?" "Seven or eight, &s;ir," very well, and what will it co&s;t?" Why, &s;ir, it did not co&s;t you &s;o much be|cau&s;e we baked it at home, and I u&s;ed our own milk; it will not co&s;t above &s;e|ven-pence
<PB N="16" REF="037139_0016_100C93C529F7B6A0">
to tho&s;e who pay for both. Here too bread is &s;aved."</P>
<P>"Pray, Sarah, let me put in a word," &s;aid farmer White. "I advi&s;e my men to rai&s;e each a large bed of par&s;nips. They are very nouri&s;hing, and very pro|fitable. Sixpennyworth of &s;eed, well &s;owed, and trod in, will produce more meals than four &s;acks of potatoes; and what is material to you who have &s;o little ground, it will not require more than an eighth part of the ground which the four &s;acks will take. Par&s;nips are very good the &s;econd day warmed in the frying-pan, and a little ra&s;her of pork or baoon will give them a nice flavour."</P>
<P>Dr. Shepherd now &s;aid, "as a proof of the nouri&s;hing quality of par&s;nips, I was reading in a hi&s;tory book this very day, that the American Indians make a great part of their bread of par&s;nips, though Indian corn is &s;o famous: it will make a little variety too."</P>
<P>"I remember," &s;aid Mrs. White, "a cheap di&s;h, &s;o nice that it makes my mouth water. I peel &s;ome raw potatoes,
<PB N="17" REF="037139_0017_100C93C715DDABE8">
&s;lice them thin, put the &s;lices into a deep frying-pan, or pot, with a little water, an onion, and a bit of pepper. Then I get a bone or two of a brea&s;t of mutton, or a little &s;trip of &s;alt pork, and put into it. Cover it down clo&s;e, keep in the &s;team, and let it &s;tew for an hour."</P>
<P>"You really get me an appetite, Mrs. White by your dainty receipts," &s;aid the Doctor. "I am re&s;olved to have this di&s;h at my own table." "I could tell you another very good di&s;h, and &s;till cheaper," an&s;wered &s;he. "Come, let us have it," cried the Doctor. "I &s;hall write all down as &s;oon as I get home, and I will favour any body with a copy of the&s;e re|ceipts who will call at my hou&s;e." "And I will do more, Sir," &s;aid Mrs. White, "for I will put any of the&s;e women in the way how to dre&s;s it, the fir&s;t time, if they are at a lo&s;s. But this is my di&s;h.</P>
<P>"Take two or three pickled herrings, put them into a &s;tone jar, filled up with potatoes, and a little water, and let it bake in the oven till it is done. I would give one hint more," added &s;he; "I have taken to u&s;e nothing but potatoe &s;tarch;
<PB N="18" REF="037139_0018_100C93C9C8CE7C70">
and though I &s;ay it that &s;hould not &s;ay it, nobody's linen in a common way looks better than ours."</P>
<P>The Doctor now &s;aid, "I am &s;orry for one hard&s;hip which many poor people la|bour under. I mean the difficulty of get|ting a little milk. I wi&s;h all farmers wives were as con&s;iderate as you are, Mrs. White. A little milk is a great comfort to the poor, e&s;pecially when their children are &s;ick. And I have known it an&s;wer to the &s;eller as well as to the buyer, to keep a cow or two on purpo&s;e to &s;ell it out by the quart.</P>
<P>"Sir," &s;aid farmer White, "I beg leave to &s;ay a word to the men, if you plea&s;e, for all your advice goes to the wo|men. If you will drink le&s;s Gin you may get more meat. If you ab&s;tain from the ale <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e you may many of you get a little good beer at home." "Aye, that we can Farmer," &s;aid poor Tom the thatch|er, who was now got well. "Ea&s;ter Mon|day for that&mdash;I &s;ay no more.&mdash;A word to the wi&s;e." The Farmer &s;miled and went on. "The number of public hou&s;es in many a pari&s;h brings on more hunger
<PB N="19" REF="037139_0019_100C93CB559A6928">
and rags than all the taxes in it heavy as they are. All the other evils put toge|ther hardly make up the &s;um of that one. We are now rai&s;ing a fre&s;h &s;ub&s;cription for you. This will be our rule of giving. We will not give to Sots, Gamblers, and Sabbath breakers. Tho&s;e who do not &s;et their young children to work on week days, and &s;end them to &s;chool on Sundays, de&s;erve little favour. No man &s;hould keep a dog till he has more food than his family wants. If he feeds them at home they rob his children; if he &s;tarves them, they rob his neighbours. We have heard in a neighbouring city that &s;ome people carried back the &s;ub&s;cription loaves be|cau&s;e they were too coar&s;e; but we hope better things of you." Here Betty Plane begged with all humility, to put in a word. "Certainly," &s;aid the Doctor, "we will li&s;ten to all mode&s;t complaints, and try to redre&s;s them." "You were plea&s;ed to &s;ay, &s;ir," &s;aid &s;he, "that we might find much comfort from buying coar&s;e bits of beef. And &s;o we might, but you do not know, &s;ir, that we can &s;eldom get them, even when we had the money, and times were not &s;o bad." How &s;o, Betty?" "Sir, when we go to butcher Jobbins for a bit

Now, &s;ir, if &s;uch kind gentle-folks were aware that this gravy and &s;oup not only con&s;ume a great deal of meat, (which, to be &s;ure, tho&s;e have a right to u&s;e who can pay for it) but that it takes away tho&s;e coar&s;e pieces which the poor would buy, if they bought at all, I am &s;ure they would not do it.

<HEAD>THE GRAND ASSIZES; OR General Goal Delivery.</HEAD>
<P>THERE was in a certain country a great King, who was al&s;o a Judge. He was very merciful, but he was al&s;o very ju&s;t; for he u&s;ed to &s;ay, that ju&s;tice was the foundation of all goodne&s;s. His &s;ubjects were apt enough, in a general way, to extol his merciful temper, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e &s;ubjects who were always committing crimes which made them lia|ble to be puni&s;hed by his ju&s;tice. This la&s;t quality they con&s;tantly kept out of &s;ight, till they had cheated them&s;elves into a not<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n that he was too good to pu|ni&s;h at all.</P>
<P>Now it had happened a long time be|fore, that this whole people had broken their allegiance, and had forfeited the Kings' favor, and had al&s;o fallen from a
<PB N="23" REF="037139_0023_100C93D362B02080">
very pro&s;perous &s;tate in which he had placed them, having one and all become bankrupts: but when they were over head and ears in debt, and had nothing to pay, the King's &s;on mo&s;t generou&s;ly took the whole burthen of their debts on him&s;elf; and, in &s;hort, it was propo&s;ed that all their affairs &s;hould be fettled, and their very crimes forgiven, (for they were criminals as well as debtors) provi|ded only they would &s;hew them&s;elves to be &s;orry for what they had done them|&s;elves, and be thankful for what was done for them. I &s;hould here remark, that a book was al&s;o given them, in which a true and faithful account of their own rebel|lion was written; and of the manner of obtaining the King's pardon, together with a variety of directions for their conduct in the time to come; and in this book it was particularly mentioned, that after having lived a certain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">mber of years in a part of the &s;ame King's coun|try, and under his eye and juri&s;diction, there &s;hould be a Grand A&s;&s;izes, when every one was to be publickly tried for his pa&s;t behaviour, and after this trial was over, certain heavy puni&s;hments were to be inflicted on tho&s;e who &s;hould
<PB N="24" REF="037139_0024_100C93D4F44DFBF0">
have &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in their rebellion, and certain high premiums were to be be|&s;towed as a gracious reward upon the obedient.</P>
<P>It may be proper here to notice, that this King's Court differed in &s;ome re|&s;pects from our Courts of Ju&s;tice, being indeed a &s;ort of Court of Appeal, to which que&s;tions were carried after they had been imperfectly decided in the Com|mon Courts. And although with us all criminals are tried, and very properly in my opinion, by a Jury of their Peers, yet in this King's country the mode was very different; for &s;ince every one of the people had been in a certain &s;en&s;e crimi|nals, the King did not think it fair to make them judges al&s;o. It would indeed have been impo&s;&s;ible to follow in all re|&s;pects the cu&s;toms which prevail with us, for the crimes with which men are char|ged in our Courts are mere overt acts, as the Lawyers call them, that is, acts which regard the outward behaviour; &s;uch as the acts of &s;triking, maiming, &s;teal|ing, and &s;o forth. But in the King's Court it was not merely outward &s;ins, but &s;ins of the heart al&s;o which were to be puni&s;hed.
<PB N="25" REF="037139_0025_100C93D6FB3AEEF0">
Many a crime, therefore, which was ne|ver heard of in the Court of King's bench, or at the Old Bailey, was here to be brought to light, and was re&s;erved for this great day. Among the&s;e were Pride and Oppre&s;&s;ion, and Envy, and Malice, and Revenge, and Covetou&s;ne&s;s, and Secret Vanity of Mind, and Evil Thoughts of all &s;orts, and all evil Wi&s;hes and De&s;ires. When Covetou&s;ne&s;s, indeed, put men on committing Robbery, or when Malice drove them to an act of Murder, then the common Courts immediately judged the criminal, without waiting for the&s;e Great A&s;&s;izes; neverthele&s;s, &s;ince even a Thief and Murderer would now and then e&s;cape in the common Courts, for want of evi|dence, or through &s;ome fault or other of the Judge or Jury, the e&s;cape was of lit|tle moment for the poor criminal, for he was &s;ure to be tried again by this great King; and even though he &s;hould have been puni&s;hed in &s;ome &s;en&s;e before, yet he had now a farther puni&s;hment to fear, unle&s;s, indeed, he was one of tho&s;e, who had obtained, by the means I before &s;poke of this great King's pardon. The &s;ins of the heart, however, were by far the
<PB N="26" REF="037139_0026_100C93D9A1773AF0">
mo&s;t numerous &s;ort of &s;ins, which were to come before this great Tribunal; and the&s;e were to be judged by this great King in per&s;on, and by none but him&s;elf; be|cau&s;e he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a certain power of get|ting at all &s;ecrets.</P>
<P>I once heard of a certain King of Sici|ly, who built a whi&s;pering gallery in the form of an ear, through which he could hear every word his rebellious &s;ubjects uttered, though &s;poken ever &s;o low. But this &s;ecret of the King of Sicily was no|thing to what this great&punc; King po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; for He had the power of knowing every thought which was conceived in the mind, though it never broke out into words, or proceeded to actions.</P>
<P>Now you may be ready to think, per|haps, that the&s;e people were wor&s;e off than any others becau&s;e they were to be ex|amined &s;o clo&s;ely, and judged &s;o &s;trictly; far from it; the King was too ju&s;t to ex|pect bricks without giving them &s;traw; he gave them, therefore, every help that they needed. He gave them a book of direct|ions, as I before ob&s;erved; and becau&s;e they were naturally &s;hort-&s;ighted, he &s;up|plied
<PB N="27" REF="037139_0027_100C93DB2C5D1DE0">
them with a gla&s;s for reading it, and thus the mo&s;t dim-&s;ighted might &s;ee, if he did not wilfully &s;hut his eyes: but though the King <HI>invited</HI> them to open their eyes, he did not <HI>compel</HI> them; and many remained &s;tone blind all their lives with the book in their hand, becau&s;e they would not u&s;e the gla&s;s, nor take the pro|per means for reading and under&s;tanding all that was written for them. The humble and &s;incere learnt in time, to &s;ee even that part of the book which was lea&s;t plainly written; and it was ob&s;erved that the ability to under&s;tand it depended more on the heart than the head; an evil di&s;po&s;ition blinded the &s;ight, while humi|lity operated like an eye-&s;alve.</P>
<P>Now it happened that tho&s;e who had been &s;o lucky as to e&s;cape the puni&s;hment of the lower Courts, took it into their heads that they were all very good &s;ort of people, and of cour&s;e very &s;afe from any danger of this <HI>Great Assize.</HI> This grand intended trial had been talked of &s;o much, and put off &s;o long, (for it had &s;eemed long at lea&s;t to the&s;e &s;hort-&s;ighted people,) that many per&s;uaded them&s;elves it would never take place at all; and far the great|er
<PB N="28" REF="037139_0028_100C93DCBA0CA820">
part were living away therefore with|out ever thinking about it; they went on ju&s;t as if nothing at all had been done for their benefit; and as if they had no King to plea&s;e, no King's &s;on to be thankful to, no book to guide them&s;elves by, and as if the a&s;&s;izes were never to come about.</P>
<P>But with this King "a thou&s;and years were as one day, for he was not &s;lack concerning his promi&s;es, as &s;ome men count &s;lackne&s;s." So at length the &s;olemn period approached. Still, however, the people did not prepare for the &s;olemnity, or rather, they prepared for it much as &s;ome of the people in our towns are apt to prepare for the A&s;&s;ize times; I mean by balls and fea&s;tings, and they &s;aw their own trial come on, with as little concern as is felt by the people in our &s;treets, when they &s;ee the Judge's proce&s;&s;ion en|ter the town, who indeed comfort them|&s;elves that it is only tho&s;e in the pri&s;ons who are guilty.</P>
<P>But when at la&s;t the day came and every man found that he was to be judg|ed for him&s;elf, and that &s;ome how or o|ther, all his &s;ecrets were brought out,
<PB N="29" REF="037139_0029_100C93DEB91DA888">
and that there was now no e&s;cape, things began to take a more &s;erious turn. Some of the criminals were got together debating in an outer Court of the Grand Hall, and there they pa&s;&s;ed their time, not in compunction and tears, not in com|paring their lives with what was required in that book which had been given them, but in comparing them&s;elves with &s;uch as had been &s;till more notorious offenders.</P>
<P>One who had grown wealthy by rapine and oppre&s;&s;ion, but had contrived to keep within the letter of the law, in&s;ulted a poor fellow as a thief, becau&s;e he had &s;to|len a loaf of bread. "You were far wickeder than I was, &s;aid a Citizen to his Apprentice, for you drank and &s;wore at the ale-hou&s;e every Sunday night." Yes," &s;aid the poor fellow, "but it was your fault that I did &s;o, for you took no care of my &s;oul, but &s;pent all your Sab|baths in jaunting abroad or in rioting at home; I might have learnt, but there was no one to teach me; I might have followed a good example, but I &s;aw only bad ones. I &s;inned again&s;t le&s;s light than you did." A drunken journeyman, who had &s;pent all his wages on gin, took com|fort
<PB N="30" REF="037139_0030_100C93E103A82C28">
that he had not &s;pent a great e&s;tate in Bribery at Elections, as the Lord of his Manor had done, while a perjured Elector boa&s;ted that he was no drunkard, like the journeyman.</P>
<P>I have not room to de&s;cribe the awful pomp of the Court, nor the terrible founding of the trumpet which attended the Judge's entrance, nor the &s;itting of the Judge, nor the opening of the books, nor the crouding of the millions, who &s;tood before him. I &s;hall pa&s;s over the multitudes who were tried and condemn|ed to dungeons and chains, and fire, and perpetual bani&s;hment, from the pre&s;ence of the King, which always &s;eemed to be the &s;adde&s;t part of the &s;entence. I &s;hall on|ly notice further, a few who brought &s;ome plea of merit, and claimed a right to be rewarded by the King, and even decei|ved them&s;elves &s;o far as to think that his own book of laws would be their ju&s;tifi|cation.</P>
<P>A thoughtle&s;s Spendthrift advanced without any contrition, and &s;aid, "that he had lived hand&s;omely, and had hated
<PB N="31" REF="037139_0031_100C835B22908A90">
the covetous whom God abhorreth, and that he tru&s;ted in that pa&s;&s;age of the book which &s;aid, that 'Covetou&s;ne&s;s was Idol|atry;' and that he therefore hoped for a favorable &s;entence.' It proved that this man had not only avoided Covetou&s;ne&s;s, but he had even left his wife and chil|dren in want through his exce&s;&s;ive pro|digality. The Judge immediately poin|ted to that place in the Book where it is written, he that provideth not for his hou&s;ehold, is wor&s;e than an Infidel. He that liveth in plea&s;ure is dead while he liveth; "thou," &s;aid he,
<Q>in thy life time, received'&s;t thy good things, and now thou mu&s;t be tormented.</Q>
&mdash;Then a mi&s;er, whom hunger and hoarding had worn to &s;kin and bone, crept forward and prai&s;ed the &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed on this extravagant youth, "and &s;urely," &s;aid he, "&s;ince he is condemned, I am the man that may make &s;ome plea to favor&mdash;I was never idle or drunk, I kept my body in &s;ubjection. I have been &s;o &s;elf-denying that I am certainly a Saint: I have loved neither father nor mother, nor wife, nor children to exce&s;s, in all this I have o|beyed the book of the law,&mdash;Then the Judge &s;aid, "but where are thy works of

mercy and thy labors of love? &s;ee that family which peri&s;hed in thy &s;ight la&s;t hard winter, while thy barns were o|verflowing; that poor family were my re|pre&s;entatives, yet they were hungry, and thou gave&s;t them no meat." "Go to now, thou rich man, weep and howl for the mi&s;eries that are come upon you. Your gold and your &s;ilver is cankered, and the ru&s;t of them &s;hall be a witne&s;s again&s;t you, and &s;hall eat your fle&s;h as it were fire."&mdash;Then came up one with a mo&s;t &s;elf &s;ufficient air, He walked up boldly, having in one hand the plan of an Ho&s;pital which he had built, and in the other the drawing of a &s;tatue, which was erecting for him in the country that he had ju&s;t left, and on his forehead ap|peared, in Gold Letters, the Li&s;t of all the Public Charities to which he had &s;ub&s;cribed. He &s;eemed to take great plea&s;ure in the condemnation of the Mi&s;er, and &s;aid, "Lord, where &s;aw I thee hungry and fed thee not, or in pri&s;on and vi&s;ited thee not? I have vi&s;ited the fatherle&s;s and widow in their affliction." &mdash;Here the Judge cut him &s;hort by &s;aying "True, thou did&s;t vi&s;it the fatherle&s;s, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> fulfil equally that other
<PB N="33" REF="037139_0033_100C93E6F9AA7B50">
part of my command to keep thy&s;elf un|&s;potted from the world. No, thou wert conformed to the world in many of its &s;inful cu&s;toms, "thou did&s;t follow a mul|titude to do evil;" "thou did&s;t love the world and the things of the world:" and the motive to all thy charities was not a regard to me but to thy own credit with thy fellow men. Thou ha&s;t done every thing for the &s;ake of reputation, and now thou art vainly tru&s;ting in thy works, in&s;tead of putting all thy tru&s;t in my Son, who has offered him&s;elf to be a &s;urety for thee. Where has been that humility and gratitude to him which was required of thee. No, thou would&s;t be thine own &s;urety: thou ha&s;t tru&s;ted in thy&s;elf: thou ha&s;t made thy boa&s;t of thine own goodne&s;s; thou ha&s;t &s;ought af|ter and thou ha&s;t enjoyed the prai&s;e of men, and verily I &s;ay unto thee, "thou ha&s;t thy reward."</P>
<P>A poor di&s;ea&s;ed blind cripple, from the very Ho&s;pital which this great man had built, then &s;ell pro&s;trate on his face, cry|ing out, "Lord be merciful to me a &s;inner!" on which the Judge, to the &s;ur|pri&s;e of all, &s;aid, Well done, good and

faithful &s;ervant." The poor man re|plied, "Lord, I have done nothing! but thou ha&s;t <HI>suffered." "Well,</HI>" &s;aid the Judge; "thou ha&s;t been an example of patience and meekne&s;s, and though thou had&s;t but few talents, yet thou ha&s;t well improved tho&s;e few; thou had&s;t time, this thou did&s;t &s;pend in the humble du|ties of thy &s;tation, and al&s;o in earne&s;t prayer, even for that proud Founder of thine Ho&s;pital, who never prayed for him&s;elf; thou wa&s;t indeed blind and lame, but it is no where &s;aid, my Son give me thy feet, or thine eyes, but <HI>give me thy heart</HI>; and even the faculties I did grant thee, were employed to my glory; with thine ears thou did&s;t li&s;ten to my word, with thy tongue thou did&s;t &s;hew forth my prai&s;e, Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.&mdash;There were &s;everal who came forward and boa&s;ted of &s;ome &s;ingle and particular virtue, in which they had been &s;uppo&s;ed to excel. One talked of his ge|nero&s;ity, another of his courage, and a third of his fortitude; but it proved, on clo&s;e examination, that &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;up|po&s;ed virtues were merely the effect of a particular con&s;titution of body: that o|thers proceeded from a fal&s;e motive, and
<PB N="35" REF="037139_0035_100C93EB9524EB08">
that not a few of them were actual vices, &s;ince they were carried to exce&s;s; and under the pretence of fulfilling one duty, &s;ome other duty was lo&s;t &s;ight of; in &s;hort, the&s;e partial virtues were none of them done in obedience to the will of the King, but merely to plea&s;e the per&s;on's own humour, and they would not, there|fore, &s;tand this day's trial, for "he that keepeth the whole law, and yet wilfully and habitually offends in any one point, was declared guilty of breaking the whole.</P>
<P>At this moment a &s;ort of thick &s;cales fell from the eyes of the multitude. They could now no longer take comfort by mea&s;uring their neighbours' conduct a|gain&s;t their own. Each at once found him&s;elf in his true light, and &s;aw, alas! when it was too late, that he &s;hould have made the book which had been given him his rule of practice before, &s;ince it now proved to be the rule by which he was to be judged. Nay, every one now thought him&s;elf even wor&s;e than his neighbour, becau&s;e, while he only <HI>saw</HI> and <HI>heard</HI> of the guilt of others, he <HI>felt</HI> his own in all its aggravated horrors.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="037139_0036_100C93ED4562A598">To complete their confu&s;ion, they were compelled to acknowledge the ju&s;|tice of the judge who condemned them; and al&s;o to approve the favorable &s;en|tence by which thou&s;ands of other crim|inals had not only their lives &s;aved, but were made happy and glorious beyond all imagination, and all this was in con|&s;equence of their &s;incere repentance, and their humble acceptance of the pardon offered to them by the King's Son. One thing was remarkable, that whil&s;t mo&s;t of them who were condemned never ex|pected condemnation, but even claimed reward for their &s;uppo&s;ed innocence or goodne&s;s, all who were rewarded or for|given were &s;en&s;ible, that they owed eve|ry thing to a mere act of grace, and they cried out with one voice, "Not unto us, not unto us, but unto thy name be the prai&s;e!!!</P>
