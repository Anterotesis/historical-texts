<BIBL><HI>II. Samuel I.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">7.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THOUGH the thoughts of death and a future &s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> have not a con&s;tant and uniform influence on human life, yet they will &s;ometimes pre&s;s upon the imagina|tion. Our circum&s;tances may be flouri&s;hing even to the extent of our wi&s;hes; the cup of affliction m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y be removed from our lips, and we may enjoy the warme&s;t beams of pro&s;perity; but &s;till we cannot always avoid the reflexion, that we mu&s;t, &s;ome time or other, bid adieu to all &s;ublunary enjoyments.</P>
<P>As the great end of life is to prepare for death, Pro|vidence hath &s;urrounded us with &s;uch objects as furni&s;h matter for moral reflections, and continually remind us that this life is tran&s;itory and uncertain. The fall of the leaf in autumn, and the fading of the gra&s;s, give us warning that <HI>the fa&s;hion of this world pa&s;&s;eth away.</HI></P>
<P>But le&s;t the&s;e changes in the vegetable world &s;hould produce no effect upon us, we have frequent op|portunities of contemplating the ravages of death among our own &s;pecies. Almo&s;t every day, in&s;tances of mor|tality happen around us, and numbers are continually dropping into the gulf of eternity. But even the&s;e ad|monitions are often regarded with indifference. The

<P>It is therefore nece&s;&s;ary that more awful intimations &s;hould occa&s;ionally be given; that events &s;hould &s;ome|times happen, which may irre&s;i&s;tably arre&s;t attention, and teach mankind that they are but mortal. When a per&s;on illu&s;trious for his actions, and beloved for his virtues, departs this life, the eyes of mankind are opened; tho&s;e reflections, which they once avoided as unplea&s;ant, ru&s;h involuntarily into the mind, and convince them of the precarious nature of their enjoyments. The leaves of the fore&s;t may fall unnoticed; but when the maje&s;tic oak is torn up by the tempe&s;t, and laid pro&s;trate on the earth, it cannot fail to attract the ob&s;ervation of the pa&s;&s;ing traveller. The &s;olitary cottage is gradually de|&s;troyed by time, and &s;inks imperceptibly into decay; but when <HI>the cloud capt towers and gorgeous palaces</HI> are overturned, we pau&s;e to contemplate the mighty ruin, and heave a &s;igh for the in&s;tability of human grandeur.</P>

<P>It is not my intention to trace, at pre&s;ent, the &s;teps by which this great man ro&s;e to the &s;ummit of glory, nor to relate tho&s;e exertions by which he conducted his country through a long and perilous war, and erected the temple of Liberty in this we&s;tern world.&mdash;When a life is marked by &s;uch a train of &s;plendid actions; when a character is di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;uch an a&s;&s;emblage of vir|tues, the mind is at a lo&s;s where to begin the &s;triking enumeration.

<P>In&s;tead, then, of attempting an eulogium on the character of the decea&s;ed, I &s;hall endeavor, through di|vine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to make a few ref<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ctions on the melan|choly event, which hath &s;eparated our friend from u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for ever.</P>

<P>Veterans of America! ye who have fought in the &s;acred cau&s;e of freedom, and conquered under the ban|ners of WASHINGTON, what are your feelings on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion? You have &s;een your Hero victorious in the conflict of armies; you have &s;een him directing the war where to pour its fury; you have &s;een him pre&s;iding in our councils, and forming plans for the pro&s;perity of a ri&s;ing empire; but never again &s;hall you behold him engaged in the&s;e glorious and u&s;eful occu|pations. He who led you to victory and triumph, hath fallen him&s;elf beneath the arm of the exterminating angel. Neither the roar of battle, nor even the voice of his country&mdash;that voice which he always heard with veneration, and obeyed with alacrity, &s;hall again di&s;|turb his repo&s;e. He who taught you how to conquer, has now taught you a more awful and important le&s;&s;on; he hath taught you how to die. Your Chief was not wanting to him&s;elf in the trying hour of di&s;&s;olution. He was unlike tho&s;e men, who can brave death in the tumult of battle, but &s;hrink from his &s;ilent and gradual approaches. To the very la&s;t moment he <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his &s;oul in peace,</HI> and pre&s;erved that firmne&s;s and intrepidity which had di&s;tingui&s;hed him through the whole cour&s;e of his life. For him death had no terrors, and the grave was only a quiet a&s;ylum.</P>

It &s;prung from a more exalted principle&mdash;from a &s;teadfa&s;t belief in Re|velation, and a &s;trict adherence to the precepts of the Go&s;pel. If you wi&s;h, then, after an honorable and u&s;eful life, to die as he died, this is the foundation, and this is the only one, on which you mu&s;t build your hopes.</P>
<P>Young men of America! To you I now addre&s;s my|&s;elf. At your time of life, the bo&s;om naturally glows with the love of virtue, and the admiration of excel|lence, and pants to emulate the actions of illu&s;trious men. It is therefore proper, that the mo&s;t glorious examples &s;hould be placed before your eyes; and is it po&s;&s;ible that a model more perfect and unexceptionable than that of WASHINGTON, &s;hould be &s;elected for your imitation? You have heard every tongue re&s;ound his prai&s;es: you have &s;een the aged &s;oldier forget his infirm|ities, and kindle with the enthu&s;ia&s;m of <HI>other years,</HI> while he related his campaigns, and de&s;cribed the bat|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> he has fought with WASHINGTON. You have heard others extol his charity and benificence, which re&s;embled a river &s;cattering ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ure and fertility along its banks. You have heard men of the greate&s;t wi&s;dom and experience, &s;peak with admiration of his political

talents. And though &s;ome, affecting greater &s;agacity than their neighbours, have pretended to di&s;cover flaws in his conduct as a &s;tate&s;man, yet even the&s;e per&s;ons now lament his death with unfeigned &s;orrow; they ac|knowledge his various <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd uncommon merits, and ex|pre&s;s their apprehen&s;ions that his lo&s;s will never be re|paired.</P>
<P>You &s;ee then, that virtue, though it may be over &s;hadowed by a tran&s;ient cloud, will at la&s;t break forth upon the world in full brilliancy. You &s;ee that true merit and real excellence will be re&s;pected, when per|&s;onal invective has lo&s;t its &s;ting, and the in&s;inuations of &s;lander are no longer remembered. With &s;uch pro&s;|pects before your eyes; with &s;uch a model for imita|tion; with &s;uch hopes to &s;timulate your exertions, you will be altogether inexcu&s;able, if you wa&s;te your time and mi&s;apply your talents. Remember that now is the rea&s;on for making the&s;e acqui&s;itions, which may here|after render you honorable and u&s;eful to your country, and rai&s;e you to an equality with WASHINGTON, EPAMINONDAS, and the worthies of the world. If you are actuated with a generous de&s;ire of reaching &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hed excellence, you mu&s;t never lo&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ight of this grand maxim; that virtue only can conduct you to true glory and &s;ub&s;tantial happine&s;s; that no life is plea&s;ing to God, nor re&s;pectable in the eyes of the world, unle&s;s it be u&s;eful to mankind. Do not deceive your&s;elves on a &s;ubject of &s;uch va&s;t importance as the regulation of your conduct. This affects your pre&s;ent and future happine&s;s; it will either exalt you to glory, or &s;ink you into contempt and ignominy.</P>
<P>There are two traits in the character of WASHING|TON, which I mu&s;t earne&s;tly recommend to your imi|tation, as it is to be feared that they are growing rather unfa&s;hionable&mdash;I mean Mode&s;ty and Diffidence. The&s;e are qualities becoming at every period of life, but pecu|liarly graceful and ornamental in youth. They will never fail to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s the world &s;trongly in your favour.

While the Grecian Sage was inculcating the pure&s;t &s;y&s;tem of mo|rality, which had then appeared in the world; while he delivered &s;uch &s;ublime doctrines of Religion, and &s;uch ju&s;t ideas re&s;pecting the Deity, as a&s;toni&s;hed an idolatrous and &s;uper&s;titious age; he was deeply im|pre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of human frailty and ignorance. While the Briti&s;h Philo&s;opher removed the veil, which had &s;o long concealed the wonders of creation; while he penetrated into the deep de&s;igns of the Almighty; while his va&s;t &s;oul comprehended, at a glance, the various laws which regulate the movements not only of this world, but of tho&s;e myriads of worlds, which are di&s;tributed throughout the immen&s;ity of &s;pace; he never dreamed of his &s;uperiority to the re&s;t of mankind.

<P>Such, my young Friends, was the conduct of WASH|INGTON, while he was ju&s;tly con&s;idered as the fir&s;t man in America.

Nor is it by acting thus, that you will be enabled to ri&s;e to di&s;tinction; to &s;ave your country in the hour of danger, and re|ceive the united plaudits and acclamations of your Fellow-Citizens.</P>
<P>I do not pretend to &s;ay that all of you will have it in your power to rival the glory of WASHINGTON. On the contrary, I am convinced that the great quali|ties which he di&s;played, are be&s;towed only on a cho&s;en few. But even if you po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all his powers, it would require an extraordinary concurrence of circum&s;tances to call them forth into action, and exhibit them in their true colours to the world. All of you cannot expect to be placed in &s;uch a &s;ituation; for Providence does not make u&s;e of every man as an in&s;trument for promo|ting its great de&s;igns, for delivering a country, and giving happine&s;s and liberty to future generations.&mdash; Human &s;ociety, you know, cannot exi&s;t without &s;ub|ordination. There mu&s;t be <HI>hands</HI> to execute, as well as <HI>heads</HI> to contrive.&mdash;Still, however, if you endeavour to do your duty in that &s;tate of life wherein you are placed, you may contribute greatly to the public wel|fare and happine&s;s. Your life will be re&s;pectable, your death will be lamented, and your <HI>memory will be ble&s;&s;ed.</HI> In one re&s;pect, at lea&s;t, you will equal WASHINGTON him&s;elf. You will enjoy no le&s;s than he did, the &s;miles of an approving con&s;cience; and this, doubtle&s;s, was a reward more grateful to his exalted &s;oul, than all the honours which this world could have be&s;towed.</P>
<P>Add to this, that the greate&s;t tribute you can pay to the memory of our departed Hero, is to imitate his virtues. Statues and monuments are, at be&s;t, but du|bious tokens of the public affection. They may be erect|ed to the bad as well as to the good; to the tyrant, no

Be firm and united in maintaining the Liberty and Con&s;titution of your country. Di&s;play a generous ar|dour for the &s;upport of that religion, which is the only &s;ure anchor that holds man to his duty. Act thus, and I will venture to predict, that <HI>you will in no wi&s;e lo&s;e your reward.</HI> The lips of the hoary head will ble&s;s the band of ri&s;ing patriots. The late Father of his Country (if aught of mortality can reach him now) will experience an augmentation of happine&s;s in the re|gions of bli&s;s. America, in&s;tead of <HI>one,</HI> will have <HI>many</HI> WASHINGTONS, and her enemies will &s;till tremble.&mdash; Altho' <HI>the mighty has fallen,</HI> yet they will know that the holy flame of freedom has not expired; that <HI>the weapons of war have not peri&s;hed</HI> with him.</P>
<P>To tho&s;e among you, my Countrymen, who direct the Councils of America, I mu&s;t not omit this favorable opportunity of addre&s;&s;ing a few words. I mean not to read political lectures from the pulpit, nor to arraign the &s;entiments and conduct of any. It would be the height of pre&s;umption, for a per&s;on of my age and in|experience, to offer directions to the Senators and Re|pre&s;entatives of a free, powerful, and enlightened na|tion. But in addre&s;&s;ing you on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, I fear not the imputation of arrogance and temerity, &s;hel|tered as I am under the re&s;pectable authority of WASH|INGTON.

<P>No man (&s;aid an ancient &s;age) ought to be called happy before his death.
