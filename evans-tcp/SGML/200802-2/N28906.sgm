<P>THE SUN ALSO ARISETH, AND THE SUN GOETH DOWN.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE face of man is upward, and his eyes behold the heavens. By this, man is di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, and highly privileged above all the lower creation: for <HI>truly the light is &s;weet, and a plea&s;ant thing it is for the eyes to behold the &s;un.</HI></P>
<P>Contemplating the firmament of light&mdash;the <HI>&s;tars</HI> which the Lord ordained; how high! how large! how numerous! how bright!&mdash;we gaze with ad|miration: a flood of glory pours upon our minds; and our hearts are kindled with a pathos as of burning coals. Yet the <HI>moon,</HI> when &s;he ari&s;eth, ruleth the night: as queen of heaven, &s;he com|mandeth
<PB N="6" REF="038540_0005_1012529838CA8B30">
the attention of every eye: all the &s;kies, &s;ilently, put on her &s;ilver robes; and wide o'er the earth extendeth her reign of light!&mdash;But <HI>the &s;un al&s;o ari&s;eth!</HI> and where are now the &s;tars? and where their beauteous queen? In the ha&s;te of wil|ling obedience they have all retired, opening for him the wide path of heaven its whole length; which, at once, is filled with his golden beams.</P>
<P>Here is wi&s;dom! When we under&s;tand that <HI>the heavens were made in wi&s;dom,</HI> we perceive that the natural heavens are the exact type and pattern of all worlds: and we are led to contemplate, with wonder and plea&s;ure, the analogy of all God's works.</P>
<P>This is a meditation the mo&s;t profitable and &s;ublime: and we are warranted by the &s;criptures to enter the &s;acred field, and make u&s;e of the&s;e fir&s;t works of God, to a&s;&s;i&s;t our thoughts and reflec|tions upon tho&s;e wrought through every age, down to the pre&s;ent moment. In the &s;criptures, very fre|quently, the ju&s;t are compared to the &s;tars, the be|lieving, to the moon, and the eminently good, to the clear &s;hining of the &s;un.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="038540_0006_1012529AA69DAA78">But the world on which we are now called &s;o|lemnly to meditate is &s;ocial America: in this he|mi&s;phere many great lights have ari&s;en: &s;tars of magnitude have here beamed, and held a re&s;plen|dent cour&s;e; and often hath America, in her &s;o|cial walks, beheld the moon rounding her full <HI>orb,</HI> bright and unclouded.</P>
<P>But the <HI>&s;un</HI> al&s;o hath ari&s;en: one character hath here been exhibited, as di&s;tingui&s;hed and unrival|led, as the &s;un in the firmament; and which the &s;tupendous ta&s;k hath devolved upon me, this day, to eulogize.</P>
<P>But where &s;hall I begin! The &s;tars clu&s;ter, we compare one with another; they are formed into con&s;tellations, and have their order: but there is, there <HI>can be,</HI> but one &s;un; with him there is none to compare: nor doth the &s;un pre&s;ent particular di&s;|tingui&s;hed points, which might direct a de&s;crip|tion: it is one body of light.</P>
<P>GEORGE WASHINGTON, the man or|dained by Heaven to rule our &s;ocial day, was every way qualified and marked out for his work. His per&s;on was mo&s;t excellent&mdash;his countenance pecu|liarly
<PB N="8" REF="038540_0007_1012529C4396CED8">
bright, and inde&s;cribably expre&s;&s;ive of the no|ble&s;t intellectual powers, di&s;po&s;itions and acquire|ments. His limner needed not to depart from the truth for the &s;ake of the picture: the greate&s;t like|ne&s;s was the be&s;t picture. And the &s;ame ob&s;erva|tion may be made of his hi&s;torian: the be&s;t in|formed, and the mo&s;t upright and impartial hi&s;to|rian, will give the greate&s;t and be&s;t character of WASHINGTON.</P>
<P>I had a great de&s;ire to &s;ee the man of whom I had heard &s;o much, to &s;atisfy my&s;elf, if veneration and love had not given wings to the imagination, in the de&s;cription given of the dignity of his per|&s;on, and the &s;ymmetry and expre&s;&s;ion of his coun|tenance; but when I &s;aw him, one bright day, at the head of his army, marching again&s;t Cornwallis, I was &s;atisfied: I found, that, as prompt as the imagination ever is in dre&s;&s;ing, gracing, and ex|hibiting to advantage, the dear object of the heart, &s;omething was here to be conceived of <HI>only</HI> by the eye.</P>
<P>A man, kept from a view of the face of the cre|ation, might form ideas of the beauty of &s;ome
<PB N="9" REF="038540_0008_1012529EAE7B94F8">
objects beyond what, in compari&s;on with others, belongeth to them; but he would never form too exalted ideas of the &s;un: the livlie&s;t and mo&s;t plea&s;ing imagination of the brightne&s;s of the &s;un, is the &s;ight of the eye.</P>
<P>This countenance, as we naturally expect, was the true index of the mind; <HI>a mind</HI> full of light and heat, which nothing can de&s;cribe, but the whole life of WASHINGTON.</P>
<P>He was &s;eriou&s;ly re&s;erved, but of ea&s;y addre&s;s; moderate, yet re&s;olute; grave, yet &s;prightly; mild, but heroic; prudent, but vigorous; liberal, <HI>liberal,</HI> with economy.</P>
<P>His di&s;cernment was &s;urpri&s;ing; his judgment, no le&s;s wonderful: he penetrated, weighed and foreca&s;t every thing; and his application was in|ce&s;&s;ant&mdash;<HI>All</HI> directed to the wi&s;e&s;t and noble&s;t objects&mdash;&s;ocial happine&s;s&mdash;his country's freedom, independence, honour and pro&s;perity&mdash;liberty, <HI>liberty</HI>&mdash;the rights and duties of man&mdash;and what|ever might exalt and felicitate the whole human race.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="038540_0009_101252A219000A28">Humane&mdash;he pitied his enemies, and rendered good for evil. Ho&s;pitable&mdash;his door was opened to the &s;tranger, as to a friend: and impartial&mdash;to him all had free acce&s;s: no &s;ect or party, &s;ociety or di&s;trict, formed his circle; but, like that of the &s;un, it included all.</P>
<P>Intere&s;ting him&s;elf, deeply and <HI>con&s;cientiou&s;ly,</HI> in the cau&s;e of virtue; he was forward to &s;u&s;tain la|bours, and faithful in every tru&s;t&mdash;private and public&mdash;in &s;ocial life&mdash;at the head of armies&mdash;as a magi&s;trate&mdash;in war, and in peace: per&s;evering in the pur&s;uit of the benevolent object to the end.</P>
<P>But what, perhaps, is mo&s;t wonderful in this character, was that which is commonly called good fortune; but which we know to be the &s;pecial agency of Divine Providence: for <HI>the race is not to the &s;wift, nor the battle to the &s;trong.</HI></P>
<P>General WASHINGTON &s;prang from one of the wealthie&s;t and mo&s;t re&s;pected families in Ame|rica; and &s;oon, in the events of Providence, be|came almo&s;t the &s;ole object of &s;pecial attention and care. Being the favourite of the family, and of all acquaintances; in a part of the country di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
<PB N="11" REF="038540_0010_101252A4860A5F18">
for literary improvment, and popular edu|cation; and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing from a child the be&s;t con|&s;titution, and almo&s;t uninterrupted health; his ad|vantages were the be&s;t that could have been en|joyed.</P>
<P>And no &s;ooner was he formed for any con&s;picu|ous &s;tation, than he was placed in the very &s;phere where he might &s;hine with every po&s;&s;ible advan|tage.</P>
<P><HI>He</HI> never had to &s;eek a &s;phere of action: that Hand which &s;tretched out the heavens, and order|ed where the &s;un &s;hould ri&s;e, opened before WASHINGTON every door. U&s;ually, for men to a&s;cend to the lowe&s;t &s;pheres of light, <HI>hoc opus, hic labor e&s;t</HI>; but, for WASHINGTON, the eburne gate was lifted up, and it was neither <HI>labour</HI> nor <HI>pains</HI> to a&s;cend to the vertex.</P>
<P>He was ever pro&s;perous; whatever he engaged in ended well: and miraculous indeed were his pre&s;ervations&mdash;amid&s;t common dangers&mdash;and in battles, where the &s;lain on the right hand and on the left were many&mdash;but mo&s;t of all from the fell &s;nares and toils of a wily, watchful and implacable
<PB N="12" REF="038540_0011_101252A62057FFB0">
foe; who knew all the depths of Satan, and could ea&s;ily de&s;cend to the lowe&s;t, even to countenance and encourage the dark a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in. But the &s;oul of WASHINGTON was guarded by more than &s;hield or &s;word: it was bound up in the roll of life, and hidden beyond the &s;earch of malice. He lived! he conquered! he &s;aw his labours all fini&s;h|ed&mdash;his de&s;ires all accompli&s;hed! He ran the whole race, and reached the goal; neither faint nor wearied; but like the &s;trong man, that enjoy|eth the evening with the vigour of the morning. Millions, in a proper &s;en&s;e, gave him their hearts; Genius devoted his &s;ong; and Nature decreed her Vernon for his triumph.</P>
<P>He was beloved, greatly beloved, mo&s;t univer|&s;ally beloved! by affinities, by dome&s;tics, &s;oldiers, citizens, countrymen, and foreigners; by great and &s;mall. He was the beloved child, the beloved youth, the beloved man, the beloved chri&s;tian, and the beloved &s;age. The true and general af|fection that he &s;hared compareth with all the re&s;t, and &s;trikingly evinceth the agency of that Hand which holdeth all hearts: and worthy was he to be thus beloved.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="038540_0012_101252A896FD8B38">Our WASHINGTON lived at the mo&s;t event|ful and momentous period: he &s;hined, a &s;ummer's &s;un: he held his cour&s;e, a harve&s;t day. His was a day of great men, and a day of great events; and all con&s;pired to make WASHINGTON <HI>great.</HI></P>
<P>A HANCOCK, an ADAMS, a FRANKLIN, a JEFFERSON, a WARREN, a GREENE, a TRUM|BULL, a LIVINGSTON, a HENRY&mdash;a cloud of <HI>&s;eventy-five men</HI> was prepared as a chariot for the advent of WASHINGTON.</P>
<P>A George the Third, a Briti&s;h court, navy and army, had ju&s;t ari&s;en to the zenith of empire, and the height of in&s;olence; ruling the &s;eas, and, with a countenance the mo&s;t terrific, menacing every &s;hore, and claiming a right to bind free-born America, <HI>in all ca&s;es what&s;oever.</HI> Never was there a cau&s;e of re&s;i&s;tance more ju&s;t; never, a clearer call to put on the harne&s;s; never, a cau&s;e more intere&s;ting to the human race, that called for the &s;word.</P>
<P>This was thy day, O WASHINGTON! Thou wa&s;t rai&s;ed up for &s;uch a time as this! All
<PB N="14" REF="038540_0013_101252ABD2FCAFF0">
this train of wonderful events united together to make our Golden Orb the centre of the &s;ocial &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>But, though we view a man, in &s;ociety, worthy of a compari&s;on with the &s;un, in the natural world; yet we view neither the one nor the other as per|fect or divine. There are &s;pots in the &s;un; his beams are &s;ometimes &s;corching; and, though he eclip&s;eth all the heavens with his brightne&s;s, he in his turn &s;uffers eclip&s;es.</P>
<P>There were, doubtle&s;s, &s;ome imperfections in the character of WASHINGTON; but, like the &s;pots in the &s;un's di&s;k, they were lo&s;t in his excel|lences; they were comparatively &s;mall.</P>
<P>But, alas! &s;ome men have been &s;o &s;tupid and di&s;honourable, as to give to the &s;un divine ho|nours&mdash;to pay to the creature the homage due to the Creator! Hath the wor&s;hip of the heathen added any thing to the glory of the &s;un? Far otherwi&s;e: in&s;tead of adding, in this way, they have detracted from his glory. The idolatrous wor&s;hip, which hath been offered to the natural &s;un, hath ri&s;en up, like the fog of mar&s;hy places,
<PB N="15" REF="038540_0014_101229AF333D5EE0">
and ob&s;cured his beams. Heathen lands are ju&s;tly &s;tyled dark and benighted lands: their idola|tries ca&s;t a gloom over the face of the creation.</P>
<P>And with what indignation &s;hould we expre&s;s the conduct of &s;ome men, in favoured, <HI>enlightened</HI> America, who&s;e fooli&s;h hearts, being equally dar|kened with tho&s;e of the heathen, have acted the &s;ame &s;tupid and bruti&s;h part! who have attempted to ob&s;cure the brightne&s;s of the wonderful charac|ter of WASHINGTON, by the fumes of idola|trous prai&s;e! Were the&s;e WASHINGTON'S friends? Never! never! but the enemies of the revolution, &s;eekers and time-&s;ervers. Never did this effulgent character &s;hine &s;o dimly, as when it hath been thus <HI>profanely</HI> eulogized.</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved of the heathen, in their adora|tions paid to the &s;un, that their &s;ervile minds led them to dwell much upon his rare and mo&s;t un|plea&s;ant a&s;pects: they have more to &s;ay of his eclip&s;es, than of all his bright and benignant in|fluences&mdash;a &s;triking proof of their being influenced by the devil. And the &s;ame circum&s;tance may be ob&s;erved of the adulators of WASHINGTON.
<PB N="16" REF="038540_0015_101252AFDC722A60">
Audacious men! they have dared to in&s;ult his ever-faithful friends, when attempting to defend his true character again&s;t their impious flattery; and call them WASHINGTON's enemies, be|cau&s;e they would not bow down, and give to the creature, the mo&s;t exalted creature, the glory due to the Creator.</P>
<P>But WASHINGTON de&s;ired not this: it was to him mo&s;t painful, as the tear of &s;orrow often be&s;poke. He realized he was a man; a mortal man; an accountable man. He confe&s;&s;ed imper|fections, which none but him&s;elf could &s;ee. And no man appeared to have a clearer and more con|&s;tant view of the divine agency over him, than him&s;elf. How earne&s;tly and repeatedly did he call on all his friends&mdash;on all America&mdash;to give the glory to God! How doth this aggravate the conduct of his bla&s;phemous adulators!</P>
<P>O WASHINGTON! did&s;t thou &s;ay in thy Farewell Addre&s;s, "I &s;hall carry with me the hope that my country will never cea&s;e to view the errors I may have committed with indulgence; and that, after forty-five years of my life dedicated
<PB N="17" REF="038540_0016_101252B3581CD230">
to its &s;ervice, with an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be con&s;igned to obli|vion?" Wi&s;t thou not that they were already co|vered and con&s;igned to <HI>oblivion</HI> by the effulgence of thy beneficent life?</P>
<P>But <HI>the &s;un goeth down.</HI> How &s;olemn the mo|ment! how affecting the &s;cene! America, cover|ed with her tokens of mourning, turneth her eyes to the we&s;tern horizon, to behold an event often contemplated with an anxious heart&mdash;a &s;etting &s;un&mdash;a &s;un going down, to ari&s;e no more.</P>
<P>We have no rea&s;on to expect another WASH|INGTON in America; for <HI>by wi&s;dom God crea|ted the heavens,</HI> and there is but one &s;un in the wide expan&s;e: we may not look for another &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed a character in our &s;phere, while the pre&s;ent order of things continues.</P>
<P>The &s;tars al&s;o, his compatriots, have become occidental, and rapidly fall from heaven. This year hath been remarkable for the decea&s;e of great men in America. Solemn thoughts pre&s;s upon the mind! The &s;ocial &s;y&s;tem hath received a great &s;hock in the death of WASHINGTON;
<PB N="18" REF="038540_0017_101252B5C42F9C08">
and what can be &s;haken mu&s;t ere long be re|moved.</P>
<P>How ominous is this event! When you con&s;i|der this, and the general a&s;pect of all the great events now taking place through the world, with a recollection of my particular views of the di|vine prophecies, you will not &s;uppo&s;e the thought, in me, ari&s;eth from the enthu&s;ia&s;m of the moment, that they portend the clo&s;ing &s;cene&mdash;that the night is approaching, which will immediately pre|cede that <HI>other</HI> day, new in its nature, divine, and eternal. May we be prepared for that mo&s;t &s;olemn &s;cene; and may this event be &s;anctified to us, and to all the people, for that end.</P>
<P>But we have con&s;olation in the mid&s;t of our mourning; <HI>light ari&s;eth in the darkne&s;s.</HI> WASH|INGTON died in the full confidence and affec|tion of a free and happy people: and though our Golden Orb de&s;cendeth below the horizon of na|tural life, the &s;kies &s;till reflect his rays. O WASH|INGTON! thou &s;till live&s;t in the grateful heart of republican America, and there thou wilt ever live.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="038540_0018_101252B82DD6A650">More! infinitely more! Behold a Divine Sun ari&s;eth! O ZION! thy Sun &s;till &s;hineth in all his &s;trength; and <HI>thy Sun &s;hall not go down!</HI> The LORD is thine everla&s;ting light, and thy God thy glory.</P>
<P>What infinite obligations of gratitude and prai&s;e are we laid under to God, who according to WISDOM framed the heavens; who appointed the &s;un and the moon to &s;hine in their glorious &s;pheres, and mar&s;halled the &s;tars in their beautiful order; and who hath &s;tretched out tho&s;e heavens before our eyes, as the <HI>pattern</HI> of all his wonderful works, in the &s;ocial and civil worlds, and of what, finally, will be exhibited in perfection in the world of glory!</P>
<P>O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good, for his mercy endureth forever! to Him that by wi&s;dom made the heavens, for his mercy endureth forever! to Him that made <HI>great lights,</HI> for his mercy endureth forever! to Him that rai&s;ed up WASHINGTON, pre&s;erved him, and gave him victory, peace and pro&s;perity, for his mercy endur|eth forever!</P>
