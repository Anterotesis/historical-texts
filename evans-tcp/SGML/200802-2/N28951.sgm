<Q>O LORD, thou ha&s;t &s;earched me out, and known me: Thou knowe&s;t my down-&s;itting and mine up-ri&s;ing: Thou art about my path, and about my bed, and &s;pie&s;t out all my ways.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>How true, how a&s;toni&s;hing is this thought! Almighty GOD, my maker, is ever pre&s;ent with me. He is infinite in being; and therefore mu&s;t be every where. He is infinite in know|ledge; and therefore every thing mu&s;t be known to him. No creature is too incon&s;iderable for his notice, who is the maker of all, and <Q>careth for all alike.</Q> The friends, the relations, and acquaintance, whom I &s;ee and conver&s;e with every day, know not half &s;o much of my con|duct as He does, nor are half &s;o attentive to it How hourly careful &s;hould I be, then, to ap|prove my&s;elf to him! Among my relations and friends there are &s;ome whom I regard more than the re&s;t, either out of greater affection for their goodne&s;s and kindne&s;s; or out of reverence for their greater wi&s;dom and dignity; or out of in|tere&s;t, as being capable of doing me more good or hurt. All the&s;e motives of the highe&s;t re|gard are joined in Him. His excellence is more than thought can conceive: Whatever is beau|tiful, or good, or amiable in the world, flows from Him as its &s;ource. In Him is all great|ne&s;s and maje&s;ty, all wi&s;dom and knowledge; every thing that is glorious, awful, venerable.
<PB N="4" REF="038601_0004_101234FF685C1B88">My hourly dependence is upon Him, and all my expectations through an eternity to come. From him I have received my life, my being, every power and faculty of &s;oul and body. Every innocent delight I enjoy, is his gift: In every danger he is my pre&s;ent help. No power but his could guide me &s;afely through the intri|cate mazes of life. Hitherto his providence has carefully watched over me, and his right-hand has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> me up: And through all my future life, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> is truth it&s;elf, has promi&s;ed never to fail me nor for&s;ake me, if on my part I will but &s;erve him faithfully, as in my bapti&s;mal vow I have promi&s;ed to do. That ble&s;&s;ed covenant I am going to renew, by partaking of the holy &s;acrament. Had not our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour died to redeem mankind, we mu&s;t all have appeared before an all-&s;eeing God, of infinite ju&s;tice and holine&s;s, without &s;ecurity of being con&s;idered otherwi&s;e than as objects of di&s;plea&s;ure. But we know that he looks upon us now as objects of the tendere&s;t mercy. He invites us to <Q>pour out our hearts before him</Q> at all times: <Q>To call upon him in the time of trouble:</Q> <Q>To look unto him and be &s;aved.</Q> O my &s;oul, in all thy ways acknowledge him, and he &s;hall direct thy paths!</P>
<P>Let me then a&s;k my&s;elf, as in his &s;ight, What is the general turn of my temper, and di&s;po&s;i|tion of my mind? My mo&s;t trifling words and actions are ob&s;erved by him; and every thought is naked to his eye. Could I &s;uppo&s;e the king, or any the greate&s;t per&s;on I have any knowledge
<PB N="5" REF="038601_0005_10123501E716E988">of, were within reach of ob&s;erving my common daily behaviour, though un&s;een by me, &s;hould I not be very particularly careful to pre&s;erve it in every re&s;pect decent and becoming? Should I allow my&s;elf in any little froward humours? Should I not be a&s;hamed to appear peevi&s;h and ill-natured? Should I u&s;e &s;o much as one har&s;h or unhand&s;ome expre&s;&s;ion even to my equal, or my meane&s;t inferior, even were I ever &s;o much provoked? much le&s;s &s;hould I behave irreverent|ly to my parents or &s;uperiors. This awful Be|ing, in whom I live and move, and from whom no ob&s;curity can hide me, by whom the very hairs of my head are all numbered, He knows the obligations of every relation in life: He &s;ees in their full light their reciprocal duties of pa|rents and children, of hu&s;bands and wives, of neighbours and fellow-&s;ervants. He knows the aggravated guilt of every offence again&s;t the&s;e ties of &s;ociety, however we may be di&s;po&s;ed to treat them as trifles: and every piece of &s;tub|bornne&s;s and pride, of ill-humour and pa&s;&s;ion, of anger and re&s;entment, of &s;ullenne&s;s and per|ver&s;ene&s;s, expo&s;es us to his ju&s;t indignation.</P>

<Q>BLESSED are they that do hunger and thir&s;t after righteou&s;ne&s;s.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>&mdash;Our Lord and Saviour has pronounced this ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, and through his grace I hope to partake of it.
<PB N="6" REF="038601_0006_1012350486938C48">Hunger and thur&s;t naturally prompt us to &s;eek, without delay, the means of &s;atisfying them. What then is the food of the mind? Whole|&s;ome in&s;truction and religious meditation. If then I &s;incerely do hunger and thir&s;t after righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, I &s;hall be frequently feeding my mind with pious books and thoughts. I &s;hall make the returns of the&s;e meals as regular as I can, and &s;eldom &s;hall I find any nece&s;&s;ity &s;trong e|nough to make me mi&s;s them a whole day to|gether.&mdash;But then it ought to be remembered too, that even the&s;e, the be&s;t hours of my life, ought never to encroach upon the duties and employments of my &s;tation, whatever they may be. Am I in a &s;uperior &s;tation of life? My duty then probably takes in a large compa&s;s; and I am accountable to my Maker for all tho&s;e ta|lents intru&s;ted with me by him for the benefit of my fellow-creatures. I mu&s;t not think of li|ving to my&s;elf alone; or of devoting that time to imitate the employment of angels, which was given me for the &s;ervice of men. Religion mu&s;t be my chief end, and my be&s;t delight; it mu&s;t regulate all I think or do; but whatever my &s;tation is, I mu&s;t fulfil all its duties. Have I lei&s;ure and genius? I mu&s;t give a due portion of my time to the elegant improvements of life; to the &s;tudy of tho&s;e &s;ciences that are an orna|ment to human nature; to &s;uch things as may make me amiable and engaging to all whom I conver&s;e with, that by any means I may win them over to religion and goodne&s;s. For if I am always &s;hut up in my clo&s;et, and &s;pend
<PB N="7" REF="038601_0007_1012350703FB5150">my time in nothing but exerci&s;es of devotion, I &s;hall be looked upon as moro&s;e and hypocritical, and be di&s;regarded as u&s;ele&s;s in the world. When this life is ended, we have a whole eter|nity before us to &s;pend in tho&s;e noble&s;t employ|ments and highe&s;t delights. But man, in this low &s;tate of mortality, pays the mo&s;t acceptable obe|dience to God, by &s;erving his fellow creatures.</P>
<P>Perhaps all the&s;e con&s;iderations are wide from my ca&s;e. So far from having lea&s;ure upon my hands, I have &s;carce a moment free from the nece&s;&s;ary engagements of bu&s;ine&s;s and bodily labour. While I am working hard for bread for my&s;elf and my family; or attending diligently the commands of a &s;trict ma&s;ter, to whom I am ju&s;tly accountable for every hour I have; how can I find frequent opportunities for &s;tudying the word of God, or much time to &s;pend in devout meditation? Why, happily, much is not requi|red, provided I make the be&s;t u&s;e of what little I have. Some time I mu&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eeds have on Sun|days, and this I may improve. I may diligent|ly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> to what I hear at church: I may ex|amine whether my own practice is conform|able to what I am there taught; and I may &s;pend &s;ome hours in that day, either in good di&s;cour&s;e with &s;uch as are able to in&s;truct me, or in reading &s;uch religious books as are put into my hands. Still enough will be left for cheerful conver&s;ation and plea&s;ant walks. Why &s;hould either of them be the le&s;s cheerful, for a mixture of religious thoughts? What in|deed is there &s;o gladdening as they are? Be my
<PB N="8" REF="038601_0008_10123508AC38D4D0">&s;tate ever &s;o mean and toil&s;ome; as a Chri&s;tian, if indeed I behave like one, I am equal to the greate&s;t monarch upon earth. Be my misfor|tunes and &s;orrows ever &s;o &s;evere; as a Chri&s;tian, I can look beyond death to an eternity of hap|pine&s;s, of happine&s;s certain and un&s;peakable. The&s;e thoughts, therefore, I &s;hould keep upon my mind through the whole week: They &s;hould be the amu&s;ement of my labour, and the relief of my wearine&s;s: And when my heart is thus ready, I &s;hall gladly take every opportunity to &s;ing and give prai&s;e. I &s;hall awake early to wor&s;hip that GOD, who is my defence and de|light; and I &s;hall clo&s;e every evening with prayer and thank&s;giving to Him, who&s;e <Q>ways are ways of plea&s;antne&s;s, and all who&s;e paths are peace.</Q>
Whenever I can have a quarter of an hour to &s;pare from the nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s, and the (at fit times) as nece&s;&s;ary relaxations of life, which, while they are innocent, moderate, and rea&s;onable, will never be di&s;approved by that good GOD, who has created every thing that is comely and plea&s;ant in the world, and invites us to rejoice, and do good all the days of our life; when I have any &s;pare time, I &s;hall gladly &s;pend it in reading, with reverence and attention, &s;ome portions of the Bible. In all my common conver&s;ation, I &s;hall have my eye continually up to Him, who alone can direct my paths to happine&s;s and improvements, and crown all my endeavours with the be&s;t &s;ucce&s;s. I &s;hall try to be &s;omething the better for every &s;cene of life I am engaged in: to be &s;omething
<PB N="9" REF="038601_0009_1012350BAE5F3F10">the wi&s;er for every day's conver&s;ation and ex|perience. And let me not fear, but that if I daily thus faithfully &s;trive to grow in holine&s;s and goodne&s;s, be my growth at the pre&s;ent ever &s;o imperceptible, I <Q>&s;hall in due time arrive at the mea&s;ure of the fulne&s;s of &s;tature in Chri&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>That I may be better for the la&s;t twenty-four hours, let me examine a little what temper I have been in all that time. In general, perhaps, I can recollect nothing much ami&s;s in it: but let me de&s;cend to particulars. Things are often very faulty, that appear at fir&s;t &s;ight very tri|fling. Perhaps I have &s;o fond a conceit of my|&s;elf, as to think that I can never be in the wrong. Has any unea&s;ine&s;s happened in the family this la&s;t day? Perhaps I think the fault was wholly in others, and the right entirely on my &s;ide. But ought I not to remember, that, in all di&s;putes, there is generally &s;ome fault on both &s;ides? Perhaps they begun;&mdash;But did not I carry it on?&mdash;They gave the provication:&mdash; But did not I take it?&mdash;Am I not too apt to imagine, that it would be mean entirely to let a quarrel drop, when I have a fair opportunity to rea&s;on, and argue, and reproach, to vindi|cate my injured merit, and a&s;&s;ert my right? Yet, is this agreeable to the precepts and ex|ample of Him, "who when he was reviled, re|viled not again?" Is it agreeable to his com|mands, who has charged me, if my brother tre&s;pa&s;s again&s;t me, to forgive him, not &s;even times only, but &s;eventy times &s;even? Is it agree|able to that Chri&s;tian doctrine, which exhorts
<PB N="10" REF="038601_0010_10123510430C9FD8">us, not to think of our&s;elves highly, but &s;oberly as we ought to think; and that in lowline&s;s of mind every one &s;hould think others better than him&s;elf? And, alas! how often do I think this di&s;re&s;pect, though a &s;light one, provoking to <HI>me?</HI> this &s;ituation, though a happy one, not good enough for <HI>me?</HI> How often have I had in my mouth that maxim, that a worm if it is trod upon will turn again? Wretch that I am! &s;hall I plead the example of a vile worm of the earth for di&s;obeying the commands of my Saviour, with whom I hope hereafter to &s;it in heavenly places?</P>

<P>&mdash;If our ble&s;&s;ed Sa|viour, infinitely great and excellent, was, when he a&s;&s;umed human nature, &s;o far from being exempted from the general law of labour im|po&s;ed on our fir&s;t father and all his race, who is there among&s;t men, that &s;hall plead an ex|emption? The duty of employment is two fold. Fir&s;t, as we are active and &s;piritual beings, ill would it become us to &s;it wrapt in indolence, and &s;leep away an u&s;ele&s;s life. Con&s;tant activity and exten&s;ive u&s;efulne&s;s, is the perfection of a &s;piritual being. The Great God him&s;elf is in|finitely active. "My father worketh hitherto," &s;aith our Saviour, "and I work." In their
<PB N="11" REF="038601_0011_10123511EB238888">various degrees, all the orders of angels are mini&s;tring &s;pirits. In the happy worlds above, all is life and activity. And &s;hall man, who is &s;o fond of life, lo&s;e half his little portion of it in a lazy &s;lothful &s;tate? &s;hall he quench tho&s;e &s;parks of immortality that glow in his bo&s;om, and con|tent him&s;elf with being, for three parts of his time, little better than a lump of organized clay? Innocent man in paradi&s;e, was not made for idlene&s;s: but guilty fallen man is peculiarly born to labour, and to trouble. Equally ju&s;t and merciful was the doom pronounced to <HI>Adam</HI>; <Q>In the &s;weat of thy face thou &s;halt eat bread.</Q> Human nature, corrupted and depraved by the fall of our fir&s;t parents, would be incapable of employing ea&s;e and lei&s;ure to any happy purpo&s;es. Greatly do we need con|&s;tant employment to keep us out of the reach of tho&s;e temptations from within, and from with|out, that in idlene&s;s particularly a&s;&s;ault us. Greatly do we need to have much of our minds taken up with perpetual attention to nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s and hourly duty, that they may not prey too much upon them&s;elves. Labour and pain are the nece&s;&s;ary, though unpalatable, medicine of our &s;ouls. Shall we refu&s;e to follow the pre|&s;cription of that heavenly Phy&s;ician, who drank the bittere&s;t cup for us? Toil and trouble are the ju&s;t puni&s;hments of guilty human nature: Shall we rebel again&s;t our awful Judge? Activi|ty and employment are the law of our being: And &s;hall we not obey our &s;overeign Ruler, our great and good Creator?</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="038601_0012_1012351476B416E0">What then is my proper bu&s;ine&s;s and em|ployment, that I may &s;et diligently to it? In mo&s;t &s;tations in life, this is too evident to be a&s;ked: And it is equally certain, that every &s;ta|tion, even the very highe&s;t, has its proper work and labour, which whoever performs not to the utmo&s;t of his power, is a wicked and &s;lothful &s;ervant, for we have all a ma&s;ter in heaven.</P>
<P>Come, then, my heart, let us cheerfully &s;et about our bu&s;ine&s;s. Be it &s;tudy and improve|ment of the mind, or toil of the body, or in|du&s;try of the hands: Be it care of our families and dome&s;tic affairs: Be it care of the public, and di&s;tribution of ju&s;tice: Be it care of our neighbours, and charity to the poor: Be it edu|cation of children, in&s;truction of the ignorant, attendance on the &s;ick, culture of the ground, defence of our country: Whatever it be, let us do it diligently and heartily, as unto the LORD, and not unto men. As &s;ubjects, children, &s;er|vants, let us obey our rulers, parents, ma&s;ters. And if it be the will of Providence to di&s;able us, for the pre&s;ent, from all active &s;ervice, by confining us in chambers of &s;ickne&s;s, in a weak and u&s;ele&s;s &s;tate, let us &s;et the example of an uncomplaining &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and cheerful re&s;ig|nation; and let patience, at lea&s;t, have its per|fect work.</P>
<P>This &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, this humble, this obedient di&s;po&s;ition, is poverty of &s;pirit. We ought to think nothing beneath us; nor to de&s;ire any thing but what is allotted us. We ought to imagine nothing our own, and &s;urely therefore not our
<PB N="13" REF="038601_0013_1012351763BCF8B8">time: Yet how apt are we to think it quite a hard&s;hip put upon us, if any &s;mall portion of it is to be &s;pent di&s;agreeably, and if we have not hours, and days, and years, to indulge in care|le&s;s idlene&s;s and giddy plea&s;ure!</P>
<P>Among other works, that of reforming my temper is &s;urely a mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary one. Let me therefore take my&s;elf a little to ta&s;k. How have I behaved the la&s;t day?</P>
<P>I have not, perhaps, been po&s;itively out of humour: But have I guarded my di&s;po&s;ition again&s;t every failing? Have I not indulged a nice fancy, in taking &s;ome di&s;gu&s;t at any of tho&s;e I conver&s;e with; which, trifling as it &s;eems at pre&s;ent, may, in time, quite alienate our minds from one another? A di&s;agreeable look, or manner, too often gives a prejudice again&s;t per|&s;ons who are really de&s;erving. Let me be upon my guard again&s;t &s;uch prejudices. Let me overlook all trifling infermities in others: But let me &s;pare them the pain and difficulty of having many &s;uch to overlook in me. Let me ob&s;erve in every thing a perfect cleanline&s;s and neatne&s;s; for nothing is &s;o di&s;gu&s;tful as the contrary. Let me be mild and civil, moderate and di&s;creet, in all my ways of &s;peaking: Let my behaviour al|ways be ea&s;y and obliging, natural and unaffec|ted. Let me always pre&s;erve, as much as I can, even under &s;evere trials, a cheerful plea&s;ing countenance: And, among other things, let me try to avoid, as much as po&s;&s;ible, falling in|to tho&s;e little fooli&s;h tricks and peculiarities, which every body is &s;o apt to acquire, without
<PB N="14" REF="038601_0014_10123519F241FF50">even perceiving it. I cannot help &s;eeing in others how di&s;agreeable they are, though in them I ought as little as po&s;&s;ible to attend to it. But let me watch my&s;elf a little, and di&s;cover, in order to reform, whatever I may have in me that makes me le&s;s agreeable, and therefore le&s;s u&s;eful, in &s;ociety.</P>

<Q>AND GOD &s;aw every thing that he had made; and behold, it was very good.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>Such was the face of things at the creation. Every view, that could be taken, was a view of order and beauty, of happine&s;s and plea&s;ure. Too &s;oon, by the frailty and by the guilt of man, this happy &s;tate was changed; and through &s;in, death and mi&s;ery entered into the world. Every part of our world was affected by the general di&s;order. The earth produced thorns and thi&s;tles. The &s;ea&s;ons became unfavourable. The bea&s;ts grew wild and &s;avage. And hence &s;prung a nece&s;&s;ity of labour and &s;elf-defence. Toil and wearine&s;s mu&s;t be its natural con&s;e|quence to bodies now become mortal and cor|ruptible. Pain and &s;ickne&s;s, the infirmities of old age, the fear of death and &s;ufferings, both for our&s;elves and our friends, with all that variety of evils that burthen human life; all are the &s;ad effects of &s;in. The di&s;order of our minds, the vehemence of our pa&s;&s;ions, the dimne&s;s of our
<PB N="15" REF="038601_0015_1012351C81B07EC0">under&s;tandings, tho&s;e tendencies to evil, which even the be&s;t people, at &s;ome times, mu&s;t feel &s;trongly working in their bo&s;oms, are the bitter fruits of the original corruption of human nature in the fir&s;t of men, our common parent.
Hence, &s;urely, we &s;hould draw the &s;tronge&s;t motives of humility, and throw our&s;elves down, in the deepe&s;t aba&s;ement of &s;oul, before that GOD of holine&s;s, in who&s;e <Q>&s;ight the heavens are not pure,</Q>
and who chargeth his angels with "folly;"
<Q>How much more man which is a worm, and the &s;on of man which is a worm?</Q> Una&s;&s;i&s;ted human nature could not be in a more perfect &s;tate, than our fir&s;t parents were created: Infinitely &s;uperior, certainly, to whatever we can imagine of good or excellent among our&s;elves. If they were &s;uch frail, &s;uch wretched creatures, and &s;o &s;oon forfeited their very beings&mdash;Good GOD! then what is the very be&s;t of us!
<Q>Let our confu&s;ion be ever before us!</Q>
"Let the &s;hame of our face cover us."</P>
<P>Strange it may &s;eem, after the&s;e con&s;idera|tions, to mention a happy and cheerful enjoy|ment of our beings, as a &s;erious and important duty. Many good per&s;ons, who have deeply dwelt on this dark view of our mortal &s;tate, have repre&s;ented it as utterly unfit and &s;inful for &s;uch creatures, in &s;uch a world, to think of any thing but &s;uffering and mourning. But as &s;ure as our heavenly Father is good to all, and peculiarly &s;o to us his helple&s;s new-adopted chil|dren, &s;o &s;urely they are widely mi&s;taken. The
<PB N="16" REF="038601_0016_1012351E40E83D20">ble&s;&s;ed promi&s;e of our redemption was uttered in the &s;ame moment with the doom of our mor|tality, and from that moment all was good again. Pain, and &s;uffering, and &s;orrow, became reme|dies to cure our corrupted nature; temptations, but a purifying fire to prove and to refine our virtue; and death, a kind relea&s;e from toil, a happy admi&s;&s;ion into a better paradi&s;e. Through our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, we have obtained the grace of GOD to guide us in all our ways, and to &s;up|port us under all our di&s;tre&s;&s;es. Through him, in him, we have every thing that can make us happy, unle&s;s we wilfully de&s;troy our&s;elves. <Q>Rejoice, then, in the LORD, all ye righteous; be thankful all ye who are true of heart.</Q></P>
<P>Serious and careful indeed we ought to be, watchful and diligent, humble and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive: Reflecting deeply on the frailty and vilene&s;s of our nature, and the important, the eternal in|tere&s;t that depends on this our &s;hort and very uncertain time of trial here. In this &s;en&s;e, we ought to <Q>work out our &s;alvation with fear and trembling,</Q> and even to <Q>rejoice before the LORD with reverence.</Q> But while we <Q>keep innocence, and take heed to the thing that is right,</Q> let our cheerful hearts and looks confe&s;s the goodne&s;s of our gracious Ma|&s;ter, who <Q>gives us rain from heaven, and fruitful &s;ea&s;ons, filling our hearts with food and gladne&s;s:</Q> of Him, who has made every thing good and plea&s;ant; who has the tendere&s;t con&s;ideration for all our infermities, and has provided every &s;upport and every relief that can
<PB N="17" REF="038601_0017_10123521DE9D18E0">make our pa&s;&s;age thro' this world tolerable and comfortable to us. With joyful gratitude let us accept and improve the&s;e his mercies and in|dulgences. Let us make this world as happy as we can to our&s;elves and one another: To do this, we need only be good Chri&s;tians. Our wills being perfectly re&s;igned, will acquie&s;ce, without pain, in whatever di&s;po&s;als Providence may &s;ee fit to make of us and ours: And taking "no thought for to-morrow," we &s;hall neither be tormented with vain &s;chemes, nor anxious fears. Our de&s;ires being moderate, we &s;hall pa&s;s quietly and ea&s;ily thro' life: And no unruly pa&s;&s;ions or vehement wi&s;hes will di&s;compo&s;e our peace. Being free from private intere&s;ts and &s;elfi&s;h views, we &s;hall have no rivalries nor con|te&s;ts with our neighbours. Being in perfect charity with all men, we &s;hall with all be ea&s;y, cheerful, friendly; in every thing &s;tudying to promote their good and happine&s;s: And in our turn receiving from many of them offices of kindne&s;s; and from &s;uch as are ungrateful, re|ceiving the greate&s;t benefit of all, a noble op|portunity to exerci&s;e tho&s;e duties on which GOD's forgivene&s;s of our&s;elves depends. With plea&s;ure and complacence our heavenly Father looks down on every &s;ociety of his children united in brotherly affection, and gives his ble&s;&s;ing to every &s;et of friends, and neighbours, and rela|tions, that perform their mutual relative duties as they ought, and love and delight in one ano|ther. Every innocent entertainment, that keeps up the cheerfulne&s;s and kindne&s;s of &s;ociety, he
<PB N="18" REF="038601_0018_10123525435D38A8">approves. <Q>The voice of joy and health is in the dwellings of the righteous.</Q> Our health can alone be pre&s;erved by temperance, calmne&s;s, and indu&s;try. Indu&s;try, too, makes the world look beautiful around us. It turns the barren wil|derne&s;s into a fertile plea&s;ant land; and for thorns and thi&s;tles plants the ro&s;e-tree and the vine, or &s;ows the tender gra&s;s or u&s;eful corn. Indu&s;try pre&s;erves us from inclemencies of weather, and finds &s;ome means to &s;upply every want. It pro|cures us wherewith to give alms to the poor, and thereby enables us to lay up a trea&s;ure in heaven.</P>
<P>Happine&s;s, then, a great degree of it, is in our power, even at pre&s;ent. But, fools that we are! we forfeit even pre&s;ent happine&s;s, for the indulgence of every peevi&s;h, froward hu|mour. Let me examine my&s;elf a little on this. As much as I condemn it, am not I often guilty of this unaccountable folly? Am I not readier to cheri&s;h unkind &s;u&s;picions of tho&s;e I live a|mong&s;t, than to put a fair and favourable inter|pretation upon every di&s;agreeable incident? Am I not almo&s;t upon the watch to take offence at every trifling di&s;regard? Do I not think it be|neath me ever to take the fir&s;t &s;tep towards a reconciliation? Do I not make it a point of ho|nour to keep up re&s;entment, even tho' it pains me? How much happier are they, who go through the world with an ea&s;y good-humour! Never &s;u&s;pecting that any body means them ill, who does not really and &s;eriou&s;ly hurt them: Pa&s;&s;ing over every trifle: And by placing them&s;elves
<PB N="19" REF="038601_0019_10123526EC98ABF8">above all &s;uch peevi&s;h follies, maintaining more real dignity than tho&s;e who are the proude&s;t.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>How greatly do we all of us need this ble&s;&s;ing, poor guilty creatures, who are every day offending Infinite Goodne&s;s, and provoking Almighty Power and Perfect Ju|&s;tice! How then &s;hall we be merciful as we ought? Can this duty be practi&s;ed by any but the great, or injured;&mdash;in relieving the di&s;tre&s;|&s;ed, or in pardoning offenders? Yes: Every one of us may practi&s;e it every day we live. It is a great mi&s;take to think there is no &s;uperiori|ty, but that which rank and fortune give. Every one of us may, in &s;omething or other, a&s;&s;i&s;t or in&s;truct &s;ome of his fellow-creatures? for the be&s;t of human race is poor and needy, and all have a mutual dependence on one another: There is nobody that cannot do &s;ome good; and every body is bound to do diligently all the good he can. It is by no means enough to be rightly di&s;po&s;ed, to be &s;erious, and religious in our clo&s;ets: We mu&s;t be u&s;eful too; and take care, that, as we all reap numberle&s;s benefits from &s;ociety, &s;ociety may be the better for every one of us. It is a fal&s;e, a faulty, an in|dolent humility, that makes people &s;it &s;till and do nothing, becau&s;e they will not believe that
<PB N="20" REF="038601_0020_10123529A1056650">they are capable of doing much: For every body can do &s;omething. Every body can &s;et a good example, be it to many or to few. Every body can in &s;ome degree encourage virtue and religion, and di&s;countenance vice and folly. Every body has &s;ome one or other whom they can advi&s;e, or in&s;truct, or in &s;ome way help to guide through life. Tho&s;e who are too poor to give alms, can yet give their time, their trouble, their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in preparing or forwarding the gifts of others; in con&s;idering, and repre&s;enting di&s;tre&s;&s;ed ca&s;es to tho&s;e who can relieve them; in vi&s;iting and comforting the &s;ick and afflicted. Every body can offer up their prayers for tho&s;e who need them: Which, if they do reverently and &s;incerely, they will never be wanting in giving them every other a&s;&s;i&s;tance that it &s;hall plea&s;e GOD to put in their power. Even tho&s;e who&s;e poor and toil&s;ome life can admit of their giving no other help to &s;ociety, can, by their frugality and indu&s;try, at lea&s;t keep them&s;elves, in a great mea&s;ure, from being burthen&s;ome to the public. A penny thus &s;aved, is a penny given. Dreadful &s;tate of tho&s;e idle creatures, who, dragging on a wretched, profligate life, in lazine&s;s and rags, draw to them&s;elves tho&s;e cha|rities that ought to &s;upport the helple&s;s and really di&s;abled poor! Severely, I fear, &s;hall they be ac|countable for it at the la&s;t day; and every one in proportion, who lives an u&s;ele&s;s and burthen|&s;ome drone in &s;ociety. It is our duty to pre|vent poverty, as well as to relieve it. It is our duty to relieve every other kind of di&s;tre&s;s as
<PB N="21" REF="038601_0021_10122DF4AD973808">well as the di&s;tre&s;s of poverty. People who are always innocently cheerful and good-humoured, are very u&s;eful in the world. They main|tain peace and happine&s;s, and &s;pread a thankful temper among all that live around them.</P>
<P>Thus far in general: But it is well worth con|&s;idering, in particular, my own duties and ob|ligations. Who are the people that I ought e&s;pe|cially to &s;tudy to make happy? Are they parents? &mdash;What a debt of gratitude do I owe them for all their care of me, and for me, in my helple&s;s years? How kindly did they bear with the fro|ward infirmities of my childhood; and &s;hall not I with mo&s;t affectionate tenderne&s;s &s;upport and relieve all tho&s;e which years and cares bring upon them? My more active &s;trength and vi|gour, my younger &s;pirits and clearer thoughts, may now make me, in my turn, very helpful to them. If they are good people and good pa|rents, I am &s;ure this is my duty: If otherwi&s;e, I owe them one of &s;till higher importance; I owe them the mo&s;t earne&s;t endeavours I can u&s;e for the reformation of their faults, or in&s;truction of their ignorance. This duty extends to all my relations; and to all from whom I have ever received any benefit, or any offices of friend|&s;hip. If it is my misfortune that any of them &s;hould be bad people, though they have been good to me; or if any of tho&s;e who are related to me are engaged in a wrong cour&s;e of life; ought I to fly from them, and leave them to ruin? No: gratitude and affection forbid it. Ought I then to encourage vice, and flatter
<PB N="22" REF="038601_0022_1012352E9E7DE880">folly, if it happens among tho&s;e that I love? This, my higher duty to Almighty GOD, to truth and virtue, ab&s;olutely forbids. What then is to be done? To pre&s;erve the tendere&s;t affection for their per&s;ons, and keep up and declare openly the &s;tronge&s;t abhorrence of their faults; to avoid every degree and every in&s;tance of ea&s;e and fa|miliarity, that may &s;eem to give the lea&s;t coun|tenance to their vices: and at the &s;ame time to em|ploy every art, and every earne&s;t endeavour, than can have the lea&s;t chance of reclaiming them: To pray for and pity them: To reprove and advi&s;e them; to plea&s;e and oblige them in every thing I innocently can:&mdash;But if, upon the whole, I find them irreclaimable, and my|&s;elf in the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible danger of being infected by their example,&mdash;then to fly them as I would the plague; then to cut off a right hand, and pluck out a right eye, and break through every fondne&s;s, and every attachment, that would de&s;troy my highe&s;t, my eternal intere&s;t. No ties that &s;ub&s;i&s;t among&s;t human creatures can be &s;o &s;trong, can be &s;o dear, or ought to be &s;o indi&s;&s;oluble, as tho&s;e which for ever bind us to our Creator and Redeemer.</P>
<P>Next to the bonds of nature, are tho&s;e of choice. Married per&s;ons are bound to the ob|&s;ervance of very &s;acred vows; and ought there|fore often to recollect them, and examine their conduct by them. Among other things, they &s;hould carefully con&s;ider, whether they have &s;o &s;trict a guard upon their temper as they ought, now the happine&s;s of another per&s;on is made &s;o
<PB N="23" REF="038601_0023_101235325EBFA4A0">greatly to depend on their ea&s;y good-humour and cheerfulne&s;s: Whether they a&s;&s;i&s;t and im|prove one another; and whether they are ready to receive a&s;&s;i&s;tance and advice as kindly as to give it: Whether they pre&s;erve a delicacy of behaviour, a neatne&s;s of appearance, a gentle|ne&s;s of manners, a mildne&s;s of &s;peech: Whether they enter kindly and affectionately into one an|other's intere&s;ts and concerns.</P>
<P>Friends &s;hould con&s;ider what engagements they are entered into with each other, how &s;trictly they are bound diligently to promote each other's welfare: To think of one another candidly and kindly: To overlook offences, to bear infirmities: To repay kindne&s;&s;es a thou&s;and fold: To be watchful over each other's conduct: To be true, &s;incere, faithful, obliging, open, con&s;tant: And, to have the generous courage of reproving and oppo&s;ing each other's follies and faults.</P>
<P>All per&s;ons &s;hould con&s;ider to whom they are accountable for their time, their labour, the &s;uperfluity of their fortune: To ma&s;ters, to friends, to &s;ociety in general, to the de&s;erving or the helple&s;s poor. Rich per&s;ons owe a due portion of their riches to works of charity and to the public: The great owe their protection to merit: And all people owe it to them&s;elves, to improve every moment, and every opportuni|ty, this life affords them.</P>
<P>Surely while I am making the&s;e reflections, I cannot omit more literal debts, and more im|mediate duties. Do I owe money I am not
<PB N="24" REF="038601_0024_1012353411C8F2B0">able to pay? Let me retrench every &s;uperfluous expence, till my real debts are paid. Let me work and labour indefatigably, till I am enabled to be hone&s;t: And let me not be one moment ea&s;y, while I unju&s;tly live on the expence of other people, and am hurtful to the &s;ociety that ought to be the better for me.</P>
<P>It is worth con&s;idering, too, what promi&s;es I have made. Were they ever &s;o ra&s;h, if they engaged me in nothing contrary to innocence, it is my duty to fulfil them. Happy if it teaches me the wi&s;dom to be more cautious for the future.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>Alas! does it not &s;eem from this and many other pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture, worthy of all ob&s;ervance and of all acceptation, as if it was our bounden duty in this world to lead a melancholy, wretched, un|comfortable life? And can this indeed be the will of Him who delighteth in mercy; who filleth our hearts with food and gladne&s;s; and has, in not a few places, expre&s;sly commanded us to rejoice evermore? Is there, then, an incon|&s;i&s;tency in the duties of religion? God forbid! Yet &s;hort-&s;ighted men, capable of taking into one view but a part of the va&s;t and perfectly con&s;i&s;tent &s;cheme of duty, and guided too ge|nerally by pa&s;&s;ion or weakne&s;s, are perpetually
<PB N="25" REF="038601_0025_10123536DEC2BD98">acting as if this was the ca&s;e. Some free &s;pirits there are who throw off all awful re&s;traint, and, fully &s;atisfied with them&s;elves if they keep with|in the wide&s;t bounds of what is ju&s;t allowable, indulge without caution in every thing they think &s;o. Their whole time is given up to mirth and jollity: Their whole fortunes, perhaps, are &s;pent upon them&s;elves, without any regard to the calls of charity or duty. Jollily they go on in life, till &s;ome unfore&s;een misfortune &s;tops them &s;hort, and throws a deep gloom over their funny land|&s;cape.</P>
<P>Another &s;ort of people, much to be e&s;teemed, and greatly to be pitied, are &s;crupulous about every thing; and frighted by a mi&s;apprehen&s;ion of &s;ome alarming texts, dare not allow them|&s;elves in the mo&s;t innocent conveniences, and mo&s;t harmle&s;s, and on many accounts u&s;eful and commendable, plea&s;ures. Their minds are &s;o truly pious, that they are far from deliberate|ly thinking of the infinitely great and good GOD as a hard and rigid ma&s;ter: But they act with &s;uch a &s;lavi&s;h fear, as mu&s;t needs make tho&s;e who are le&s;s well-di&s;po&s;ed frame &s;uch hor|ridly fal&s;e imaginations of him; and their well-meant &s;trictne&s;s has the mo&s;t dangerous ten|dency in the world.</P>

<P>The natural enjoyments of life are di&s;pen&s;ed
<PB N="26" REF="038601_0026_10123539B36030F0">to us by a gracious Providence, to mitigate its natural evils, and make our pa&s;&s;age through it not only &s;upportable, but, at fit times and &s;ea|&s;ons, &s;o far plea&s;ant as to make us go on with vigour, cheerfulne&s;s, and gratitude: And to give us &s;ome kind of earne&s;t of what we are bid to hope hereafter; &s;ome kind of faint notion what happine&s;s is; &s;ome &s;en&s;ible a&s;&s;urances, that there really is &s;uch a thing, though not to be in any high degrees enjoyed on this &s;ide of the grave.&mdash; Still it is a yet more merciful di&s;pen&s;a|tion of the &s;ame fatherly care, that pain and imperfection, &s;atiety and di&s;appointment, &s;hould be &s;o mixed up with all our be&s;t enjoyments in this low &s;tate of being, as to turn our chief aim and de&s;ire towards heaven. And let us not fear, unle&s;s we wilfully and madly throw our&s;elves into a giddy round of plea&s;ures on purpo&s;e to be intoxicated by them, Providence will merci|fully interpo&s;e in the fulle&s;t tide of innocent pro&s;perity, and make us by &s;ome means or other feel an emptine&s;s and di&s;&s;atisfaction in the be&s;t this world can give: E&s;pecially may this be ho|ped by tho&s;e, who take care to keep their minds always open to &s;uch &s;erious thoughts and right impre&s;&s;ions as will perpetually pre&s;ent them|&s;elves, if not rejected; and who re&s;erve &s;ome lei&s;ure time in every day, for reading and re|flecting.</P>
<P>Our Maker knows &s;o well the weakne&s;s of our frame, that he has not left it to us, to in|flict upon our&s;elves, merely by way of puni&s;h|ment, &s;uch &s;ufferings as he &s;ees it nece&s;&s;ary for
<PB N="27" REF="038601_0027_1012353C399ACF98">us to undergo. That ta&s;k would be &s;o hard a one, that he would by no means impo&s;e it upon us. No: He will take care him&s;elf, that we &s;hall unavoidably feel and experience a great deal of that evil which &s;in introduced into the world; and all he requires of us, is to &s;upport it as we ought. He requires nothing contrary to rea&s;on and the innocent inclinations of nature. If any of his laws appear har&s;h and difficult, it is from their oppo&s;ition to our acquired habits, our prejudices and corruptions. To forgive injuries, to return good for evil, to live peaceably with all men, to be always mild, obliging, and good-humoured, to be kind and patient, charitable and indu&s;trious, temperate, &s;ober, and mode&s;t, the&s;e are no grievous laws to a pure and well tuned mind; nor can its genuine dictates be better complied with, than by ob&s;erving them. Still, they will be a very grievous re&s;traint on the li|centiou&s;ne&s;s of our corrupted wills, our height|ened pa&s;&s;ions, and indulged imaginations. To be continually attentive to our conduct in every minute in&s;tance, to &s;et a watch before our mouth, and keep the door of our lips, to &s;et &s;courges over our thoughts, and the di&s;cipline of wi&s;dom over our hearts, requires a &s;oberne&s;s of mind, a diligence, a re&s;olute adherence to duty, that may undoubtedly de&s;erve the name of &s;elf-denial and mortification; though, in effect, no|thing &s;o certainly en&s;ures our happine&s;s both here and hereafter. To think we can do this by our own &s;trength, would be pre&s;umptuous and vain. Tell a man, helple&s;s with the pal&s;y,
<PB N="28" REF="038601_0028_1012353E26FFE6E8">that perfect health is his natural and eligible &s;tate; convince him ever &s;o clearly how happy it would be for him to become active and in|du&s;trious&mdash;your eloquence is mockery, and will not help him to the u&s;e of a &s;ingle limb.
But though we daily confe&s;s that we have <Q>no health in us,</Q>
HE who did actually &s;ay to the &s;ick of the pal&s;y, "Ari&s;e, take up thy bed and walk," and was immediately obeyed, can effectually re|lieve our &s;till more helple&s;s &s;tate.
To this &s;o|vereign Phy&s;ician we can apply for help; and, by the aid he imparts, are enabled to follow the regimen he enjoins; and thus to <Q>go on from &s;trength to &s;trength, till unto the GOD of gods &s;hall appear every one in Sion.</Q></P>
<P>Though our comfortable pa&s;&s;age through this life, and the attainment of un&s;peakable ble&s;&s;ed|ne&s;s in another, are the allowed, the nece&s;&s;ary, the enjoined objects of our pur&s;uit; yet &s;till, in a great degree, we are to renounce our&s;elves. By &s;incere humility we are to con&s;ider the vilene&s;s and wretchedne&s;s of our natural &s;tate: We are to acknowledge, that of our&s;elves we are able to do nothing as we ought; and, far from indulg|ing any thoughts of vanity or &s;elf-complacence, we are, when we have done our very be&s;t, to confe&s;s with unfeigned lowline&s;s, that we are unprofitable &s;ervants. We are to tru&s;t and hope alone in the merits and interce&s;&s;ion of our ble&s;|&s;ed Redeemer; and to own our&s;elves <Q>le&s;s than the lea&s;t of God's mercies.</Q> As his creatures, we are to direct all our thoughts and actions to his honour and &s;ervice, <Q>Whether we eat or drink, or
<PB N="29" REF="038601_0029_10123542EA5E2548">whatever we do, we are to do all to the glory of GOD.</Q>
In every thing, we are to con&s;ider carefully the rule of duty: not &s;crupulou&s;ly or &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly; for that tends to the di&s;honour of GOD and religion, as well as to our own di&s;|comfort. We are never to do any thing for &s;o low an end, as merely to gratify our own child|i&s;h humour; but, in all ca&s;es, to moderate and guide our&s;elves by the rules of rea&s;on and re|ligion. Thus, even in u&s;ing the nece&s;&s;ary re|fre&s;hments, and ea&s;y amu&s;ements, and innocent plea&s;ures of life, we are to behave with a due &s;en&s;e of that GOD who is every-where pre|&s;ent. We are to look up to him with thank|fulne&s;s, as the bountiful be&s;tower of all good; and cheerfully accept the&s;e indulgences for the ends to which he has appointed them. Food, to re&s;tore our &s;trength wa&s;ted in active &s;ervice, and to pre&s;erve our health and ea&s;e: Sleep, to renew our wearied &s;pirits: Plea&s;ure to gladden our hearts, and fill them with pious gratitude and filial love. This cuts off at once all that in|temperance that cro&s;&s;es tho&s;e good purpo&s;es, de&s;troys our healths, di&s;tre&s;&s;es our hearts, makes our lives &s;luggi&s;h and u&s;ele&s;s, and di&s;&s;ipates or corrupts our minds. Riches and honours al&s;o are to be received with thank&s;giving, by whom|&s;oever Providence allots them to; but then they are to be diligently, and carefully, and generou&s;ly employed in the be&s;t purpo&s;es: and even the riche&s;t and the greate&s;t ought to deny them|&s;elves all indulgences of mere humour and fan|cy, how well &s;oever they may &s;eem able to af|ford
<PB N="30" REF="038601_0030_101235457A8EC0D0">it, and kindly and faithfully con&s;ider the more pre&s;&s;ing wants of their di&s;tre&s;&s;ed fellow-creatures.

<P>It is endle&s;s to go on enumerating in&s;tances, in which the ju&s;t, the nece&s;&s;ary adherence to our duty, requires us to deny our &s;inful &s;elves. Our cowardice, our fal&s;e &s;hame, our vanity, our weakne&s;s and irre&s;olution, our fondne&s;s and par|tial affection, our indolence and love of ea&s;e: The&s;e, and numberle&s;s infirmities more, mu&s;t be &s;truggled with and conquered, when we are called out to encounter dangers; to confe&s;s our Saviour before men; to with&s;tand the &s;trong tor|rent of cu&s;tom and fa&s;hion, of importunity and ill example; to turn a deaf ear to flattery, or candidly acknowledge our errors; to re&s;i&s;t &s;oli|citations; to give righteous judgment; to for|get all our private relations and attachments, where ju&s;tice or public good are concerned; to re&s;ign our deare&s;t enjoyments, when it is the will of GOD we &s;hould; to check our &s;or|rows in their fulle&s;t flow; and to go on inde|fatigably improving our&s;elves and doing good to others, till the night overtake us, <Q>in which no man can work.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;ufferings which it &s;hall plea&s;e Almighty
<PB N="31" REF="038601_0031_101235472C456790">GOD to inflict upon us, we are to accept with humble re&s;ignation; acknowledge his ju&s;tice, and &s;ubmitting to it without a murmur. Thus patiently al&s;o we are to receive all the le&s;&s;er cro&s;&s;es he &s;ees fit to lay upon us: nor ever &s;uffer our&s;elves to fret or repine at the various infir|mities of human nature in our&s;elves or others. All the&s;e we mu&s;t look upon as parts of that penalty ju&s;tly inflicted on our fir&s;t parents guilt; and heartily thank Him, that he does not, ac|cording to the terrifying notions of Popery, either expect us to inflict them on our&s;elves, or give us the dreadful alternative of a purga|tory after death. Uncommanded &s;everities, that are of no apparent u&s;e, but to torment our&s;elves, and &s;our our natures, and &s;horten our lives, can never be acceptable to our gracious Maker. Our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, when he mentions fa&s;ting as a duty along with prayer and alm&s;giving, leaves the frequency and &s;trictne&s;s of it to our own di&s;cretion; and only in&s;i&s;ts upon one cir|cum&s;tance, which is, that we &s;hould avoid in it all hypocri&s;y and o&s;tentation; and be careful to keep up all ea&s;e, good-humour, and agree|ablene&s;s of behaviour. There are very proper occa&s;ions for exerci&s;ing this duty without the lea&s;t &s;uper&s;tition or moro&s;ene&s;s, and where it may tend to the be&s;t purpo&s;es:&mdash;Public calami|ties, private di&s;tre&s;&s;es or temptations, perplexi|ties and difficulties, times of peculiarly &s;olemn devotion, and of re&s;olutely endeavouring to con|quer &s;uch ob&s;tinate faults and ill-habits as, like the dumb &s;pirit in the go&s;pel, can <Q>come out
<PB N="32" REF="038601_0032_10123549327991E0">only by prayer and fa&s;ting.</Q> But where it makes us appear &s;tiff and di&s;agreeable, inter|feres with the innocent cheerfulne&s;s of &s;ociety, or may influence our health or temper in any wrong way; in &s;uch ca&s;es, it becomes a hurtful &s;uper&s;tition, and as &s;uch unallowable. To ob|&s;erve the public fa&s;ts appointed by authority, in a manner &s;uited to every per&s;on's &s;trength and ability, with decency and reverence, can have none of the&s;e evil con&s;equences: and the prac|tice of this duty, at fit times, and in a rea&s;on|able degree, is an excellent remembrancer of the wretchedne&s;s of being attached to any &s;en&s;ual gratifications, and the ea&s;ine&s;s as well as nece&s;&s;ity at fit times to forbear them.</P>

<HEAD>SATURDAY.</HEAD>
<P>ANOTHER week is pa&s;t; another of tho&s;e little limited portions of time which num|ber out my life. Let me &s;top a little here, be|fore I enter upon a new one; and con&s;ider what this life is which is thus imperceptibly &s;tealing away, and whither it is conducting me? What is its end and aim, its good and its evil, its u&s;e and improvement? What place does it fill in the univea&s;e? What proportion does it bear to eternity?</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="038601_0033_1012354C206C9D08">This mortal life is the beginning of exi&s;tence to beings made for immortality, and graciou&s;ly de&s;igned, unle&s;s by wilful guilt they forfeit it, for everla&s;ting happine&s;s. Compared with eter|nity, its longe&s;t duration is le&s;s than a moment: therefore its good and evil, con&s;idered without a regard to the influence they may have on an eternity to come, mu&s;t be trifling to a degree below contempt. The &s;hort &s;cene begun in birth, and clo&s;ed by death, is acted over millions of times, in every age; and all the little con|cerns of mortality are pur&s;ued, tran&s;acted, and forgot, like the labours of a bee-hive, or the bu&s;tle of an ant-hill. <Q>The thing which hath been, it is that which &s;hall be; and that which is done, is that which &s;hall be done; and there is no new thing under the &s;un.</Q> Our wi&s;dom, there|fore, is to pa&s;s through this bu&s;y dream as calm|ly as we can; and not &s;uffer our&s;elves to be more deeply attached to any of the&s;e tran&s;itory things, than the momentarine&s;s and unimpor|tance of them de&s;erves.</P>
<P>But con&s;idering this &s;hort life as a probation for eternity, as a trial who&s;e i&s;&s;ue is to deter|mine our everla&s;ting &s;tate, its importance to our&s;elves appears beyond expre&s;&s;ion great, and fills a right mind with equal awe and tran&s;port. The important day will come when there &s;hall be a new thing indeed, but not under the &s;un: For "heaven and earth &s;hall pa&s;s away;" but the words of HIM who created them, <Q>&s;hall not pa&s;s away.</Q></P>
<P>What then is the good or the evil of life,
<PB N="34" REF="038601_0034_10123540A32E7458">but as it has a tendency to prepare or unfit us for that deci&s;ive day? when <Q>the Son of Man &s;hall come in the clouds with power and great glory and &s;hall &s;end his angels, and &s;hall gather his elect from the four winds:</Q> That Son of Man who is the Son of GOD, <Q>ble&s;&s;ed for evermore;</Q> and once before came down from heaven, and took upon him this our mor|tal nature, with all its innocent infirmities and &s;ufferings; and &s;ubjected him&s;elf even to the death of the cro&s;s, that he might redeem us from all our &s;ins, and obtain the gift of everla|&s;ting life for all who &s;hould not willingly fru&s;|trate this la&s;t and greate&s;t effort of divine mercy!</P>
<P>What then have we to do, but with love and gratitude unutterable to embrace the offers of &s;alvation, and henceforth become in every thing his true and faithful di&s;ciples? To whom &s;hould we live, but to Him who died for us? To whom &s;hould we give up our&s;elves, but to Him who gave up him&s;elf for us? who&s;e <Q>yoke is ea&s;y, and his burden light.</Q> In whom &s;hould we tru&s;t, but in Eternal Truth? In whom &s;hould we cheerfully hope, but in Infinite Goodne&s;s? Whom &s;hould we copy, but HIM, who was made like unto us in all things, &s;in only excepted, and has left us an example, that we &s;hould fol|low his &s;teps? which if we do faithfully to the utmo&s;t of our power, his grace &s;hall &s;o a&s;&s;i&s;t us, that in the end we &s;hall be where he is, to be|hold his glory, and partake his bli&s;s.</P>
<P>Let me think then, and think deeply, how I have employed this week pa&s;t. Have I advanced
<PB N="35" REF="038601_0035_1012355255428CF8">in, or deviated from the path that leads to life? Has my time been improved or lo&s;t, or, wor&s;e than lo&s;t, mi&s;pent? If the la&s;t, let me u&s;e double diligence to redeem it. Have I &s;pent a due portion of my time in acts of devotion and piety, both private, public, and dome&s;tic? and have they been &s;incere, and free from all mixture of &s;uper&s;tition, moro&s;ene&s;s, or weak &s;crupulo&s;ity? Have I, in &s;ociety, been kind and helpful, mild, peaceable, and obliging? Have I been charitable, friendly, di&s;creet? Have I had a due regard, without vanity or o&s;tentation, to &s;et a good ex|ample? Have I been equally ready to give and receive in&s;truction and proper advice, careful to give no offence, and patient to take every thing in good part? Have I been hone&s;t, upright, and di&s;intere&s;ted? Have I in my way, and ac|cording to my &s;tation and calling, been diligent, frugal, generous, and indu&s;trious to do good? Have I, in all my behaviour, con&s;ulted the happine&s;s and ea&s;e of tho&s;e I live with, and of all who have any dependence upon me? Have I pre&s;erved my under&s;tanding clear, my temper calm, my &s;pirits cheerful, my body temperate and healthy, and my heart in a right frame? If to all the&s;e que&s;tions I can humbly, yet confi|dently an&s;wer, that I have done my be&s;t: If I have truly repented all the faulty pa&s;t, and made humble, yet firm and vigorous and deli|berate re&s;olutions for the future; poor as it is, the hone&s;t endeavour will be graciou&s;ly accepted: And I may to-morrow gladly and &s;ecurely ap|proach the &s;acred table, and partake that bread
<PB N="36" REF="038601_0036_1012355407F3A500">of life, which our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour gave, to nou|ri&s;h to all goodne&s;s tho&s;e who receive it worthily, and to be not only the means of grace, but the pledge of glory. Amen and Amen!</P>
