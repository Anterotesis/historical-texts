<HEAD>AN EULOGY.</HEAD>
<P>ON this day, my re&s;pectable hearers, it has long been the practice, in various parts of our country, to celebrate the birth of that DIGNIFIED AND BELOVED CHARACTER, to whom we acknowledge our&s;elves, under GOD, &s;o great|ly indebted for our national exi&s;tence.&mdash;</P>
<P>United millions are, probably, now convened to mourn his exit.&mdash;</P>
<P>The undi&s;&s;embled &s;orrow, which his removal from the&s;e earthly &s;cenes, has occa&s;ioned, and which it mu&s;t occa&s;ion, wherever the tidings of it &s;pread, among the friends of liberty and vir|tue,
<PB N="6" REF="036839_0004_100B1D81203AB3B0">
in every corner of the world, has been al|ready well expre&s;&s;ed, in many excellent perform|ances on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>But as our POLITICAL FATHERS, have with a unanimous voice, recommended this particular day, for manife&s;ting the public grief at the de|cea&s;e, and the public re&s;pect for the memory of our ILLUSTRIOUS FATHER, PATRON, AND FRIEND: I will endeavor to &s;ugge&s;t &s;ome ob&s;ervations and reflections, which I hope will be thought not un|&s;uitable to this &s;olemnity.&mdash;</P>
<P>The Death of &s;o great, &s;o good a man; of one, who has been &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed an in&s;trument, in the hand of Providence, of di&s;pen&s;ing ble&s;&s;ings to his country and mankind; and who&s;e longer continuance here, we &s;o ardently de&s;ired; is an event, which we may well mourn. But let us mourn, with humble re&s;ignation.&mdash;</P>
<P>That he, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed every public and every private virtue, which ever adorned the life of any mortal, and who lived in the continual exerci&s;e
<PB N="7" REF="036839_0005_100B1D84A95CC690">
of the&s;e virtues, &s;hould be taken from us, at this critical period of our public affairs, is among the my&s;teries of that Providence, who&s;e "judgments are un&s;earchable and who&s;e ways are pa&s;t find|ing out."&mdash;</P>
<P>Death is a theme, which every rational being ought frequently to contemplate.&mdash;And when any of our fellow-creatures around us, are &s;um|moned to leave the world, it &s;hould remind us that the time of our departure may al&s;o be near at hand, and excite us to live in an habitual pre|paration for its important con&s;equences.&mdash;But when the great and the good, the virtuous and the wi&s;e, men who were the glory of their coun|try and the ornaments of human nature, are call|ed off this &s;tage of action; we &s;hould con&s;ider the wi&s;dom and the virtue, the patrioti&s;m and the benevolence, which made them &s;o u&s;eful in their day and generation, &s;o much beloved in life, &s;o &s;incerely regretted in death, and which height|en their reward in the regions of cele&s;tial glory.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="036839_0006_100B1D86D1EDFB28">That we &s;hould make a wi&s;e improvement, of tho&s;e eminent examples of exalted virtue, which are here &s;et before us, is a dictate of rea&s;on, and it is the corre&s;pondent language of revelation. For the improvement we make of them, we are accountable to HIM, who is the Author of our being, the Source of all our mercies, the In&s;pector of our conduct, the Rewarder of virtue and the Puni&s;her of vice.&mdash;</P>
<P>It is an e&s;tabli&s;hed rule of God's moral govern|ment, that they, who are favored with &s;uperior advantages, &s;hould bring forth &s;uperior fruit to his prai&s;e.&mdash;And what can be more rea&s;onable, than that they &s;hould be di&s;tingui&s;hed for their behavior as men, as chri&s;tians, as members of &s;o|ciety, as citizens of a free and an independent country; who have not only every induce|ment in point of intere&s;t, to di&s;charge the&s;e im|portant duties of life, with fidelity; but who have al&s;o before them, the animating example of <HI>ONE</HI> who has performed the&s;e duties, with &s;o much honor to him&s;elf, with &s;o much benefit to his country, and to the admiration of mankind?</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="036839_0007_100B1D88EF44C4E0">Never were tho&s;e virtues, which exalt and dig|nify human nature, exhibited in a more plea&s;ing and a more u&s;eful light, by any of the &s;ons of Adam, than, in that BEST OF MEN, who&s;e lo&s;s, we this day mourn.&mdash;His dome&s;tic circle, or they, who had the happine&s;s to make part of his fami|ly, bear unequivocal te&s;timony to his tender and endearing attentions; to the di&s;play of all tho&s;e virtues, which &s;mooth life's rugged paths, and give a peculiar ze&s;t to its &s;weete&s;t plea&s;ures.&mdash;His profound re&s;pect for the con&s;titution and laws of his country; his readine&s;s to &s;acrifice his private intere&s;t to the public good, are too well known, ever to be called in que&s;tion.&mdash;</P>
<P>His attachment to that religion, which is the be&s;t friend of man; that religion, with which the true happine&s;s of individuals, of families, of &s;ocie|ties and of nations, is in&s;eparably connected, was abundantly manife&s;ted. &mdash;OUR WASHINGTON WAS "NOT ASHAMED OF THE GOSPEL OF CHRIST." He was not only firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed in the belief of this divine &s;y&s;tem; but he made a public pro|fe&s;&s;ion of his faith, and he adorned its doctrines
<PB N="10" REF="036839_0008_100B1D8B71485D10">
by a well ordered conver&s;ation. He e&s;teemed it his highe&s;t honor, to be numbered among the followers of the MEEK AND LOWLY MASTER.&mdash; Of his rational and unaffected devotion, no one could, with any degree of propriety, entertain a doubt. And the goodne&s;s of his motives, in the performance of every moral duty, <HI>Malice</HI> it&s;elf, could find no ground to impeach.&mdash;</P>
<P>What a genuine lu&s;tre, does it reflect upon his character, that he was ever di&s;po&s;ed to acknowl|edge the SUPERINTENDING PROVIDENCE OF GOD; not only when &s;urrounded by pro&s;perity; but al|&s;o in &s;ea&s;ons of the deepe&s;t di&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;His confi|dence was placed in that Being, who had often ap|peared for him in the time of adver&s;ity, who can bring good out of evil, light out of darkne&s;s; and who, he fondly hoped and &s;incerely believed, had many ble&s;&s;ings in &s;tore, for his much lov'd country.&mdash;Thus was he enabled to per&s;evere, with the greate&s;t fortitude and re&s;olution, in the way of his duty, under difficulties and di&s;courage|ments, that would have damped the ardor of a le&s;s elevated &s;oul; to revive the drooping &s;pirits
<PB N="11" REF="036839_0009_100B1D8DA68CB6A0">
of his countrymen, and finally to defeat the ho&s;|tile plans of tho&s;e who wi&s;hed to en&s;lave them.</P>
<P>Happy was it for AMERICA; that &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch a character, in one of her own &s;ons! Happy was it for her, that her mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed citizen, was not le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed, for his piety and vir|tue, than for tho&s;e great and glorious actions, which were more publicly known, and which have made his fame as exten&s;ive as the limits of the earth.&mdash;</P>
<P>Let our great men, whether in civil, in milita|ry, or in private &s;tations, remember, that they cannot re&s;emble WASHINGTON, in one of the mo&s;t beautiful and honorable traits in his charac|ter; if they are not the &s;incere friends of religion. De&s;titute of this, they may perform many &s;plen|did actions, which &s;hall command the loud ho&s;an|nas of the multitude, the vain applau&s;e of the un|thinking rabble.&mdash;But de&s;titute of this, they can never merit, nor enjoy the la&s;ting confidence of the wi&s;e and good. Nor will they ever be ad|mitted to &s;hare in tho&s;e future and eternal re|wards,
<PB N="12" REF="036839_0010_100B1D91530C24F8">
which await tho&s;e exalted characters, who have performed the worthie&s;t deeds, from the be&s;t of motives.&mdash;</P>
<P>To recite all the virtues of this GODLIKE MAN; particularly to enumerate his celebrated exploits; to relate all the unparalleled &s;ervices, which he has rendered to his country and mankind; would be an employment, to which, I feel my&s;elf, alto|gether unequal; and which the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, does my no means demand.&mdash;</P>
<P>Let this be the bu&s;ine&s;s of the elegant hi&s;torian, and the faithful biographer.&mdash;I &s;hall now only en|deavor to call your attention to &s;ome of the mo&s;t remarkable tran&s;actions in his public life; tran&s;ac|tions, which many of you, well remember; and which our children and our children's children will long peru&s;e, with mingled emotions of grat|itude and admiration.&mdash;</P>
<P>At a very early period of his life, WASHINGTON di&s;played tho&s;e military talents, which would have done honor to a veteran General; and, it
<PB N="13" REF="036839_0011_100B1D937980DB10">
was evidently owing to his prudent conduct, that any part of the army of the unfortunate <HI>Braddock</HI> was re&s;cued from the horrid vengeance of their &s;avage enemies.&mdash;</P>
<P>That our DEPARTED FRIEND was the mo&s;t di&s;|tingui&s;hed actor in that memorable revolution, which &s;evered us from the <HI>Briti&s;h Empire;</HI> and which con&s;tituted us, a <HI>Free, Sovereign, and Inde|pendent Nation</HI>; no one will pre&s;ume to deny. It is a truth e&s;tabli&s;hed beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of a doubt, wherever our important and intere&s;ting hi&s;tory is known.&mdash;And that he was rai&s;ed up, by Almighty GOD, to accompli&s;h the&s;e great things for us; we mu&s;t be &s;trangely blinded not to &s;ee, and &s;hamefully ungrateful not to acknowledge.</P>
<P>The peculiar talents, with which, the Author of every good and every perfect gift, was plea&s;ed to favor him, and his diligent improvement of the&s;e talents, qualified him for filling the mo&s;t ex|alted &s;tations in life, with the highe&s;t honor to him&s;elf and the greate&s;t benefit to his fellow-crea|tures. His a&s;toni&s;hing penetration, his un&s;haken
<PB N="14" REF="036839_0012_100B1D9503E11E48">
firmne&s;s and unrivalled influence, have by the ble&s;&s;ing of heaven, kindly pre&s;erved us, when our be&s;t temporal intere&s;ts have been in imminent danger, and &s;ea&s;onably di&s;pelled the dark clouds, which over&s;hadowed our political pro&s;pects.&mdash;</P>
<P>The wi&s;dom, the prudence, the undaunted courage which this GREAT MAN, invariably man|ife&s;ted, as the Leader of our armies, when con|tending with one of the mo&s;t powerful nations upon earth, are univer&s;ally known; and were confe&s;&s;ed, even by his enemies. They have rai&s;|ed a monument to his fame, which will remain unmoved, till every record of the inhabitants of this globe &s;hall be lo&s;t.&mdash;</P>
<P>Let us enquire of tho&s;e, who well knew the threatning a&s;pect of our public affairs, toward the clo&s;e of our revolutionary war; who well recollect that dangerous, that rebellious &s;pirit, which &s;ome unprincipled men, then endeavored to in&s;till into the minds of the army. They will unitedly agree in a&s;&s;uring us, that it was principally owing to the vigilant conduct and the guardian care of our
<PB N="15" REF="036839_0013_100B1D971A897500">
beloved WASHINGTON, that this dangerous &s;pirit was cru&s;hed, while yet in embryo. Whereas had it been permitted to rage, and &s;pread its baneful ef|fects, it would have greatly tarni&s;hed the glory of our revolution, and fixed a di&s;grace upon our na|tional character, which revolving ages would not have been able to efface.</P>
<P>At this mo&s;t critical period, our ILLUSRIOUS FRIEND, was the great in&s;trument, in the hand of GOD, of &s;aving us from the impending calamity, and pre&s;erving to his victorious army, that high reputation which they had &s;o ju&s;tly acquired. With the feelings of a Friend, a Soldier, and a Commander, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a warm place in their affections; he came forward and addre&s;&s;ed his companions, in arms, upon tho&s;e in&s;idious at|tempts, that were then made to &s;educe them, from their allegiance to their country &mdash; "As you value, &s;aid he, your own &s;acred honor, as you re&s;pect the &s;acred rights of humanity, as you regard the military and national character of America; expre&s;s your utmo&s;t horror and dete&s;|tation of the man, who wi&s;hes, under any &s;pecious
<PB N="16" REF="036839_0014_100B1D9AD4D9C8A8">
pretences, to overturn the liberties of our country, and who wickedly attempts to open the flood|gates of civil di&s;cord, and deluge our ri&s;ing em|pire with blood."&mdash;And we may venture to a&s;&s;ert, that it was owing to his benevolent and unweari|ed exertions, that our armies, to u&s;e his own beau|tiful and energetic language, were "impre&s;&s;ed with a proper idea of the dignified part, they had been called to act, under the &s;miles of Providence, on the &s;tage of human affairs; to per&s;evere through every extremity of hard&s;hip, &s;uffering, and danger; to pre&s;erve a perfect unvarying con&s;i&s;tency of char|acter, through the very la&s;t act, to clo&s;e the dra|ma with applau&s;e; and to retire from the milita|ry theatre, with the &s;ame approbation of angels and men, which had crowned all their former virtuous actions."</P>
<P>The con&s;picuous part, which this VIRTUOUS AND MOST RESPECTED CHARACTER took, in fram|ing and e&s;tabli&s;hing that excellent government, under which we live, and which has been pro|ductive of &s;o many ble&s;&s;ings to our common coun|try, will not, we tru&s;t, be &s;oon forgotten.&mdash;His
<PB N="17" REF="036839_0015_100B1D9C5CEB2ED8">
wi&s;e, firm, and dignified conduct when placed, by the united voice of a grateful and an admir|ing people, at the head of our nation, made us pro&s;perous at home, and highly re&s;pected abroad. The deep concerted plans, which the rulers of a foreign nation contrived, to entangle us in the quarrels of Europe, and in all the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of war; and which their emi&s;&s;aries, one after another, were commi&s;&s;ioned to put in execution; his po|litical di&s;cernment effectually fru&s;trated, and gave a mo&s;t fatal blow to the ba&s;e de&s;igns of our for|eign and dome&s;tic enemies.</P>
<P>The invaluable legacy, which this GREAT AND GOOD MAN has bequeathed his country, in that <HI>paternal addre&s;s,</HI> which he made to them, when he &s;ignified his intention to re&s;ign the high tru&s;ts and weighty cares of public life, cannot be too highly prized. If we regard it as we ought, it will be our be&s;t &s;ecurity again&s;t the wiles of tho&s;e who are envious at our growing fame. It will pre&s;erve and increa&s;e to us the rich ble&s;&s;ings which we now enjoy.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="036839_0016_100B1D9DE6EE8998">That HE &s;hould be ready to quit the retire|ment ever dear to him, and which his advanced years had rendered peculiarly dear, when danger threatened his beloved country; and again to command her armies, &s;hould enemies dare to in|vade us; while it demands our warme&s;t gratitude, it will redound to his everla&s;ting honor.</P>
<P>His unaffected piety, his uncommon virtues, have cau&s;ed him to be revered, in every corner of the earth; and have ranked him among the be&s;t of Generals, the be&s;t of State&s;men, and the be&s;t of Men.</P>
<P>Let us be grateful to that kind Being, who is the giver of life, and the lengthener out of our days; that he continued with us &s;o long, our FATHER, PATRON, AND FRIEND; and that he made him the mini&s;ter of &s;o much good to his country and mankind. And while we are humble, under that frown of Providence, which has deprived us of &s;o much exalted worth; let us endeavor, by imitating his great example, to &s;ecure tho&s;e fu|ture
<PB N="19" REF="036839_0017_100B1DA0B8A56378">
and eternal rewards, which await the friend of God and the friend of man.</P>
<P>It will not, I am per&s;uaded, be thought foreign to our &s;ubject, if I here remind you, that our hearts &s;hould ri&s;e in gratitude to the great DISPOSER OF EVENTS, that HE has rai&s;ed up one, to be placed at the head of our nation, in whom the ILLUSTRIOUS AND BELOVED PERSON|AGE whom has left our world, we humbly tru&s;t, for a world of glory, had the highe&s;t confidence, and of who&s;e admini&s;tration he warmly approv|ed. Our &s;incere thanks are certainly due to the SUPREME GOVERNOR OF THE UNIVERSE, that HE has favored us with one, to &s;ill the high|e&s;t &s;tation in our government; who&s;e &s;uperior talents, who&s;e long tried &s;ervices, and un&s;haken fidelity, entitle him to the unre&s;erved confidence and gratitude of his country. His name is alrea|dy enrolled with the greate&s;t characters, who have appeared on earth; and his glorious exertions to e&s;tabli&s;h the independence, to promote the welfare and the pro&s;perity of this FEDERAL EMPIRE, will
<PB N="20" REF="036839_0018_100B1DA3A4E56B58">
furni&s;h many intere&s;ting and in&s;tructive pages in the American hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Cordially do we wi&s;h him the be&s;t of heaven's ble&s;&s;ings! Fervently do we pray that he may be &s;upported under that painful bereavement, which he &s;en&s;ibly feels with his afflicted country! May his important life be long pre&s;erved! May his important &s;ervices never be era&s;ed from our hearts! May that God, in whom he tru&s;ts protect him! May that religion, of which, like his great predece&s;&s;or in office, he is not a&s;hamed, con&s;ole him, under all his trials and difficulties, while here, and everla&s;ting glories reward him hereafter.</P>
<P>Few indeed, among the children of men, are ever made the in&s;truments, in the hand of Provi|dence, of di&s;pen&s;ing &s;o much good to their fellow-creatures; as was the GREAT, the GOOD, the BE|LOVED MAN, who&s;e lo&s;s we this day mourn. But all of us certainly may act well our part in the &s;tations in which the Almighty has &s;een &s;it to place us. If we make this wi&s;e re&s;olution, and
<PB N="21" REF="036839_0019_100B1DA52C66ED98">
relying on his gracious aid, &s;tedfa&s;tly adhere to it, happy will it be for us! For however humble the employments in which we are now engaged,&mdash; however ob&s;cure the &s;pheres in which we now move,&mdash;the All-&s;eeing God will behold us through the journey of life, with &s;miles of approbation. We &s;hall hereafter join the great and the good, whom we loved, e&s;teemed, and revered on earth. With them we &s;hall inherit tho&s;e bright abodes, where there is fulne&s;s of joy. With them &s;hall we drink of tho&s;e pure &s;treams, which flow from his right hand, where there are plea&s;ures forevermore.</P>
