<HEAD>THE LIFE OF GEORGE WASHINGTON, <ABBR>E&s;q.</ABBR></HEAD>
<P>THIS truly great man, the third &s;on of a Mr. Augu&s;tin Wa&s;hington, was born in We&s;tmoreland county, Virginia, on the 22d day of February, 1732. He was the fir&s;t &s;on of a <HI>&s;econd</HI> marriage; a circum&s;tance which ought, in all con&s;cience, to quiet the minds of tho&s;e who have their doubts with re&s;pect to the law|fulne&s;s of &s;econd marriages. His education was of the <HI>private</HI> and <HI>proper</HI> &s;ort. Dead languages, pride, and pedantry, had no charms for him who always preferred &s;en&s;e to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound, the kernel to the &s;hell. <HI>A grammatical knowledge of his mother-tongue</HI>&mdash;<HI>the mathe|matics</HI>&mdash;<HI>geography</HI>&mdash;<HI>hi&s;tory</HI>&mdash;<HI>natural and moral philo&s;ophy,</HI> were the valuable objects of his youthful &s;tudies: And in the&s;e he made the proficiency of one who always loved to go deep. At &s;chool he was remarkable for <HI>good nature</HI> and <HI>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ndour;</HI> qualities which gave him &s;o entirely the hearts of his young companions, that a reference to him was the u&s;ual mode of deciding all differences. After leaving his tutor he acted, for a few years, as a county &s;urveyor, in which profe&s;&s;ion, his indu&s;try, as al&s;o the <HI>neatne&s;s</HI> and regularity with which he did every thing, were <HI>univer&s;ally admired.</HI></P>
<P>In 1753, the French and Indians began to make inroads on our we&s;tern frontiers along the Ohio. Governor Dinwiddie was in a peck of troubles, to get a letter of <HI>remon&s;trance</HI> to their comman|der in chief. He had applied to &s;everal young gentlemen of his acquaintance; but they were all &s;o exceedingly tender of their <HI>night-caps,</HI> they could not be prevailed on, for love or money, to venture out among the &s;avages. WASHINGTON happening to hear of it, in&s;tantly waited on his excellency, and offered his &s;ervices, but not without being afraid l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t his want of a beard &s;hould go again&s;t him. However, the governor was &s;o charmed with his mode&s;ty and manly air, that he never a&s;ked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a &s;yllable about his age, but, after thanking him for <HI>"a noble youth,"</HI> and in&s;i&s;ting on his taking a gla&s;s of wine with him, &s;lipped a commi&s;&s;ion into his hand. The next day, accompanied by an interpreter and a couple

of &s;ervants, he &s;et out on his expedition, which was, from &s;tart to pole, as di&s;agreeable and dangerous as any thing <HI>Hercules</HI> him&s;elf could have wi&s;hed. Soaking rains, chilling bla&s;ts, roaring floods, pathle&s;s woods, and mountains clad in &s;nows oppo&s;ed his cour&s;e; but oppo&s;ed in vain&mdash;The glorious ambition to &s;erve his country imparted an animation to his nerves, which rendered him &s;uperior to all difficulties, and happier far than the little &s;ouls he left behind him in William&s;burg, fidling and fea&s;ting in the Rawleigh.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note.

<P>Returning homewards, he was waylaid and &s;hot at by a French Indian, and though the copper-coloured ruffian was not 15 &s;teps di&s;tant when he fired at him, yet not even &s;o much as the <HI>&s;mell</HI> of lead pa&s;&s;ed on the clothes of our young hero; &s;o true &s;till is the promi&s;e on record in the good old book, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>

<L>And mighty angels wait on all,</L>
<L>Who in his mercy tru&s;t."</L>
</LG>
<P>On his return to William&s;burg it was found that he had executed his negociations, both with the French and Indians, with &s;o much fidelity and judgment, that he received the heartie&s;t thanks of the governor and council for the very important &s;ervices he had done his country.</P>
<P>HE was now (in the 20th year of his age) appointed major and adjutant general of the Virginia forces. Soon after this, the French continuing their encroachments, orders were given by the Engli&s;h government, for the colonies to arm and unite in one con|federacy. Virginia took the lead, and rai&s;ed a regiment of four hundred men, at the head of which &s;he placed her darling WASH|INGTON&punc;</P>
<P>WITH this handful of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fellows, col. WASHINGTON, not yet 23, boldly pu&s;hed out into the Indian country, and there for a con&s;iderable time, Hannibal-like, maintained the war again&s;t three times the number of French and Indians. At the Red-Stones he came up with a &s;trong party of the enemy, whom he engaged and effectually defeated, after having killed and taken thirty-one men. From his pri&s;oners, he obtained undoubted intelligence, that the French forces on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> of upwards of a thou&s;and re|gulars and many hundreds of Indians. But, notwith&s;tanding this di&s;heartening advice, he &s;till pre&s;&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> on undauntedly again&s;t the ene|my, and at a place called the Little-Meadows, built a fort, which he called Fort-Nece&s;&s;ity. Here he waited, hourly and anxiou&s;ly looking for &s;uccours from New-York and Penn&s;ylvania; but he
<PB N="3" REF="039062_0006_10138ED51A315280">
looked in vain&mdash;nobody came to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Not long after this, his &s;mall force, now reduced to three hundred men, was attacked by an army of 1100 French and Indians. Never did the true Vir|ginian valour make a more glorious &s;hine than on this trying occa|&s;ion.</P>
<P>To &s;ee three hundred young fellows&mdash;commanded by a &s;mooth-faced boy&mdash;all unaccu&s;tomed to the terrors of war&mdash;far from home and from all hopes of help&mdash;&s;hut up in a dreary wilderne&s;s, and &s;urrounded by four times their number of &s;avage foes, and yet, without &s;ign of fear, without thought of &s;urrender, preparing for mortal combat. Oh! it was a glorious &s;ight! never &s;ince the days of Leonidas and his three hundred deathle&s;s Spartans had the &s;un be|held its equal. With hideous whoops and yells the enemy came on like a ho&s;t of furious tygers. The woods and rocks and <HI>tall tree</HI> tops were in one continued blaze and cra&s;h of fire arms. Nor were our young warriors idle, but, animated by their gallant chief, plied their rifles with &s;uch &s;pirit, that their little fort re&s;embled a volcano in full bla&s;t roaring and di&s;charging thick &s;heets of liquid fire and of leaden deat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s among their foes. For three glorious hours, Salaman|der-like, inveloped in &s;moke and flame, they &s;u&s;tained the attack of the enemy's whole force, and laid two hundred of them dead on the &s;pot! Di&s;couraged by &s;uch de&s;perate re&s;i&s;tance, the French general, the count de Villiers, &s;ent in a flag to WASHINGTON, extolling his gallantry to the &s;kies, an offering him the mo&s;t ho|norable terms. It was &s;tipulated that COL. WASHINGTON and his little band of heroes, &s;hould march away with all the honors of war, and carry with them their military &s;tores and baggage.</P>
<P>IN the &s;pring of 1755, WASHINGTON, while bu&s;ied in the high|e&s;t military operations, was &s;ummoned to attend general Braddock, who, in the month of February, arrived at Alexandria with 2,000 Briti&s;h troops. The a&s;&s;embly of Virginia appointed 800 provin|cials to join him. The object of this army was to march through the country by the way of Will's-Creek to fort du Que&s;ne (now Pitt&s;burgh or Fort-Pitt). As no per&s;on was &s;o well acquainted with the frontier country as WASHINGTON, and none &s;tood &s;o high in military fame, it was thought he would be infinitely &s;erviceable to general Braddock. At the reque&s;t of the governor and council he cheerfully quitted his own command, to act as volunteer aid-de-camp to that very imprudent and unfortunate general. The army, near 3,000 &s;trong, marched from Alexandria to the mournful ditty of "over the hills and far away," and proceeded unmole&s;ted within a few miles of Fort-Pitt. On the morning of the day (9th of July) on which they expected to arrive, the provincial &s;couts di&s;covered a large party of French and Indians lying in ambu&s;h. WASH|INGTON, with his u&s;ual mode&s;ty, ob&s;erved to general Braddock
<PB N="4" REF="039062_0007_10138ED6B7B66BB0">
what fort of enemy he had now to deal with. An enemy who would not, like the Europeans, come forward to a fair <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">uffle in the field, but, concealed behind rocks and trees, carry on a deadly warfare with their rifles. He concluded with begging that general Braddock would grant him the honor to place him&s;elf at the head of the Virginia riflemen, and fight them in their own way. And it was generally thought that our young hero and his 800 hearts of hickory, would ea&s;ily have <HI>cleared them</HI> out too, for they were not &s;uperior to the force, which, (with only three hundred) he had thrown into &s;uch a &s;weat a twelve month before. But gen&punc; Brad|dock, who had all along treated the American officers and &s;oldiers with infinite contempt, in&s;tead of following this truly &s;alutary ad|vice, &s;welled and reddened with mo&s;t unmanly rage: "High times, by God," he exclaimed, &s;trutting to and fro, with arms a|kimbo, "High times! when a young Buck&s;kin can teach a Briti&s;h general how to fight!" Wa&s;hington withdrew, biting his lip with grief and indignation, to think what numbers of brave fellows would draw &s;hort breath that day, through the pride and ob&s;tinacy of one epauletted fool. The troops were ordered to <HI>form</HI> and ad|vance in <HI>columns</HI> through the woods!!!! In a little time the ruin, which WASHINGTON had predicted, en&s;ued. This poor devoted army, pu&s;hed on by their mad-cap general, fell into the fatal &s;nare which was laid for them. All at once a thou&s;and rifles began the work of death. The ground was in&s;tantly covered with the dying and the dead. The Briti&s;h troops, thus &s;laughtered by hundreds, and by an enemy whom they could not &s;ee, were thrown irrevo|cably into panic and confu&s;ion, and in a few minutes their haughty general, with 1200 of his <HI>brave,</HI> but unfortunate countrymen, bit the ground. Amid&s;t all this fearful con&s;ternation and carnage, amid&s;t all the uproar and horrors of a rout, rendered &s;till more dreadful by the groans of the dying, the &s;creams of the wounded, the piercing &s;hrieks of the women, and the yells of the furious a&s;|&s;aulting &s;avages, WASHINGTON, calm and &s;elf-collected, rallied his faithful riflemen, led them on to the charge, killed numbers of the enemy who were ru&s;hing on with tomahawks, checked their pur|&s;uit, and brought off the &s;hattered remains of the Briti&s;h army.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>glorious action</HI> confirmed his admiring countrymen in the very high opinion which they had conceived of their WASHING|TON. His valour and military talents were extolled to the &s;kies. The bravery of the Virginia troops on this trying occa&s;ion, rejoiced the good old mother-country, and was &s;urely enough to have taught her to de&s;pi&s;e that execrable fire-brand, general Amher&s;t, who, a few years afterwards, mo&s;t impudently a&s;&s;erted, that <HI>the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight of a grenadier's cap would put an American army to flight,</HI> and
<PB N="5" REF="039062_0008_10138EDB7958CD28">
even boa&s;ted in parliament, that <HI>he could march through all North-America with 5000 men!!!!!!!</HI></P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to our WASHINGTON, I cannot but mention here two very extraordinary &s;peeches that were uttered about him at this time, and which, as things have turned out, look a good deal like prophecies. A famous Indian warrior who a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the de|feat of Braddock, was often heard to &s;wear that WASHINGTON <HI>was not born to be killed by a bullet, "for,"</HI> continued he, <HI>"I had</HI> SE|VENTEEN <HI>fair fires at him with my rifle, and, after all, I could not bring him to the ground."</HI> And, indeed, whoever con&s;iders that a good rifle, levelled by a proper mark&s;man, hardly ever mi&s;&s;es its aim, will readily enough conclude, with this unlettered &s;avage, that &s;ome invi&s;ible hand mu&s;t have turned a&s;ide his bullets.</P>
<P>THE Rev. Mr. Davies, in a &s;ermon occa&s;ioned by Braddock's defeat, has the&s;e remarkable words&mdash;<HI>"I beg leave to point the atten|tion of the public to that heroic youth, colonel</HI> WASHINGTON, <HI>whom I cannot but hope Providence has pre&s;erved for &s;ome great &s;ervice to this country."</HI> Yes reverend Sir, for &s;ome <HI>great &s;ervice indeed.</HI>&mdash;He was pre&s;erved of God to be the political &s;aviour of his country. He who in&s;pired the flaming fancies of a BARLOW and a DWIGHT; He who imparted the ken of angels to FRANKLIN and to RITTEN-HOUSE, even he, the &s;ame all-gracious power, rai&s;ed up <HI>WASH|INGTON,</HI> to be his mini&s;ter of mercies to America. Oh! that there were an heart in us to adore the giver, and to emulate the bright virtues of his precious gift.</P>
<P>After the defeat and death of general Braddock, WASHINGTON continued to pre&s;s forward, the foremo&s;t man to fail upon every difficulty or danger that threatened his beloved country. <HI>And the Lord was with him whither&s;oever he went, and what&s;oever he did the Lord made it to pro&s;per.</HI> On every occa&s;ion he di&s;played &s;o much of wi&s;dom, indu&s;try, and valour, as gained him his country's heartie&s;t approbation, a reward which, next to the &s;mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">es of his own con|&s;cience, he valued more than all things el&s;e.</P>
<P>IN 1759, he re&s;igned his command, and entered into the married &s;tate&punc; in the 27th year of his age, with the young and amiable widow of Mr. Cu&s;tis, with whom he received one of the hand|&s;ome&s;t e&s;tates in Virginia. From this period he became as a&s;&s;iduous to &s;erve the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ate as a SENATOR, as he had hitherto been active to defend it as a &s;oldier; thus teaching us, by his own great example, that a real patriot thinks nothing done for his country, while <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> remains any thing to be done for it.</P>
<P>In the year 1773, when the damp of God was burning with pe|culiar brightne&s;s in our land, and both Britain and her colonies en|joyed a mea&s;ure of ble&s;&s;ings &s;eldom indulged to the mo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">avored nations&mdash;When, at the very mention of Old-England, our hearts
<PB N="6" REF="039062_0009_10138EDD14169FB8">
leaped for joy, as at the name of a great and venerable mother, and that mother felt an equal tran&s;port at thoughts of us, her flou|ri&s;hing colonies&mdash;When all the produce of the&s;e va&s;t and fertile regions was poured into her beloved lap, and &s;he, <HI>in return,</HI> not al|lowing us the trouble to make even a hob-nail, heaped our families with all the nece&s;&s;aries and elegancies of her ingenious arti&s;ts.&mdash;When, tho' far &s;eparated by an ocean's roar, we were yet &s;o <HI>unite<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> by love and mutual helpfulne&s;s, that the &s;ouls of Rawleigh and Co|lumbus, looking from heaven on the enchanting &s;cene, enjoyed the con&s;ummation of their wi&s;hes, and felt an acce&s;&s;ion to their bli&s;s: At this happy period, lord North brought in a bill <HI>to tax the colonies without allowing us a voice in their councils!!!</HI> The colo|nies were thunder&s;truck, and Britain her&s;elf, "&s;ighing through all her i&s;land, gave &s;igns of woe that all was lo&s;t."</P>
<P>Millions of that magnanimous and <HI>freedom-loving</HI> people execra|ted the mea&s;ure as uncon&s;titutional and wicked.</P>
<P>London, Liverpool, Gla&s;gow, Bri&s;tol, &amp;c. poured in petitions on petitions, praying the mini&s;ter, in compa&s;&s;ion to their half-ruined trade and families, to repeal the act. Petitions and remon&s;trances, without number, were &s;ent al&s;o from America to the king, to the parliament, and to the people of Great-Britain; but the&s;e, like the unfortunate petitions ju&s;t mentioned, were all con&s;igned to the <HI>"com|mittee</HI> of <HI>oblivion,"</HI> as the oppo&s;ition humorou&s;ly &s;tyled it. The mini&s;try would not honor them even with a reading! They had attempted in 1765, eight years ago, to impo&s;e on the colonies an uncon&s;titutional tax, under cover of the <HI>&s;tamp-act.</HI> This had blown up &s;uch a flame of oppo&s;ition throughout the continent, e&s;pecially at Bo&s;ton, that the mini&s;try prudently &s;uffered the matter to die away. But the gall of di&s;appointment was &s;till bitter on their minds, and they now thought to have &s;atisfaction by laying a tax of three pence in the pound on all teas con&s;umed in the colonies.* This &s;et the old flame agoing again. The coloni&s;ts at fir&s;t employ|ed, as we have &s;een, moderate mea&s;ures, but finding that the&s;e were treated with contempt, and that the face of North, black as the cloud of winter, was hard &s;et again&s;t them for evil, they ro&s;e up as one man, from Dan to Beer&s;heba, re&s;olved, like true &s;ons of Britons, to live <HI>free,</HI> or <HI>not to live at all.</HI> Soon, therefore, as the &s;hips, laden with the ill-fated tea, arrived at Bo&s;ton, in the fall of 1773, immen&s;e quantities of it (&pound;.18,000 &s;terling's worth) were trundled into the &s;ea; large parcels were de&s;troyed in other colonies, and &s;till larger parcels were returned un&s;old.</P>
<P>On the arrival of this news in England, the countenance of the mini&s;ter was dark with fury, and he proceeded, without delay, to mix up for the colonies a cup of fiery indignation, of which Bo&s;|ton, it &s;eems, was to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ue large&s;t do&s;e. As that mo&s;t unduti|ful
<PB N="7" REF="039062_0010_10138EE15A34EC60">
child had always led off the dance in outrage and rebellion again&s;t the parent &s;tate, it was determined that &s;he &s;hould pay the piper for <HI>old and new</HI>&mdash;that her pur&s;e &s;hould an&s;wer for all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ea that had been de&s;troyed&mdash;that her luxuriant trade, which had made her &s;o wanton, &s;hould be taken away from her&mdash;and that, ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">gre her high looks and proud &s;tomach, &s;he &s;hould &s;it on the &s;tool of re|pentance until his gracious maje&s;ty, George III. &s;hould be plea&s;ed to pronounce her <HI>pardon.</HI></P>
<P>On the receipt of this intelligence at Bo&s;ton, the pa&s;&s;ions of the people flew up, five hundred degrees above blood-heat! through|out the continent the fever raged with equal fury. The colonies all extolled Bo&s;ton for the firmne&s;s with which &s;he had &s;tood up for her chartered rights&mdash;liberal contributions were made for her relief&mdash;and this mini&s;terial attack on her liberties, was con&s;idered as an at|tack on the liberties of the whole, which were now thought to be in &s;uch danger, as loudly to call for a general Congre&s;s from all the colonies, to deliberate on their common intere&s;ts. This mo&s;t un|kingly body &s;at down, for the fir&s;t time, in Philadelphia, Sept. 5th, 1774. They began with publi&s;hing <HI>a bill of rights,</HI> wherein they re|peated their loyalty and love to the mother country, together with an earne&s;t wi&s;h for a <HI>con&s;titutional</HI> dependance on her; but, at the &s;ame time, they begged leave to a&s;&s;ure, that though &s;he, in her ex|ce&s;s of parental fondne&s;s, might &s;uffer her&s;elf to be bound and in|&s;ulted by North and Bute, and other Phili&s;tine lords, yet they, for their parts, were re&s;olved, like true &s;ons of Briti&s;h Samp&s;ons, to ri&s;e and fight to the la&s;t hair of their heads. They a&s;&s;erted, and, begged leave to do it pretty roundly too, as it was getting now high time to &s;peak plain, that, by the <HI>immutable laws of nature</HI>&mdash;by the <HI>principles of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution</HI>&mdash;<HI>and by their &s;everal charters,</HI> they had a right to liberty, the liberty of Briti&s;h colonies; and, moreover, that their ever-honored <HI>fathers,</HI> at the time of their emigration to this country, were entitled to all the rights of free|men; and &s;ince, by &s;uch emigration, they had neither forfeited nor &s;urrendered the&s;e rights&mdash;that they, their children, were de|termined, at the ri&s;k of every thing &s;hort of their eternal &s;alvation, to defend and to tran&s;mit them entire to their po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Millions of choice &s;pirits in England, Scotland, and Ireland, cried out <HI>"that's well &s;aid, and</HI> may <HI>God's arm &s;trike with our Ame|rican brother's;"</HI> this was coming to the point, and produced the effect that might be expected.

This filled up the mea|&s;ure of American hatred to the mini&s;try, and called forth the mo&s;t vigorous preparations for war. Every ounce of gun-powder was
<PB N="8" REF="039062_0011_10138EE430CC2830">
hu&s;banded like &s;o much gold-du&s;t; powder-mills and mu&s;quet-manufactories were erected in mo&s;t of the colonies, while others, as not liking this &s;low way of doing things, laid violent hands at once upon all the king's arms and ammunition that came in their way. The hell fraughted cloud of civil war was now ready to bur&s;t, and April the 19th, 1775, was the fatal day marked out by my&s;terious Heaven, for tearing away the infant colonies from the old mother country. Early that morning, General Gage, who&s;e force in Bo&s;ton was augmented to 10,00 men, &s;ent a detachment of 1,000&punc; to de&s;troy &s;ome military &s;tores which the Americans had collected in the town of Concord, near Lexington. On com|ing to the place, they found the town militia a&s;&s;embled on the green near the road. "<HI>Throw down your arms,</HI> and <HI>di&s;per&s;e,</HI> you rebels," was the cry of the Briti&s;h officer which was immediately followed by a general di&s;charge of the &s;oldiers; whereby eight of the Americans were killed and &s;everal wounded. The Provin|cials returned the fire with good intere&s;t, and &s;trewed the green with the dead and wounded. Such fierce di&s;charges of mu&s;quetry, produced the effect that might have been expected in a land of freemen, who &s;aw their brave countrymen engaged in the &s;trife of death. Never, before, had the bo&s;oms of the &s;wains experienced &s;uch a tumult of heroic pa&s;&s;ions. They flew to their hou&s;es, &s;natch|ed up their arms, and in &s;pite of their wild &s;creaming wives and children, darted to the glorious field where liberty, heaven-born godde&s;s, was to be bought for blood. Pouring in now from every quarter, were &s;een crowds of &s;turdy pea&s;ants with <HI>flu&s;hed cheeks,</HI> and <HI>flaming eyes,</HI> eager for battle! Fa&s;t as they came up, their long black mu&s;quets began to pour the red &s;treams of fiery vengeance. The enemy fell back appalled&punc; Every &s;tep of their retreat was &s;tained with trickling crim&s;on; every hedge or fence by which they pa&s;&s;ed took large toll of ho&s;tile carca&s;es. They would, in all probability, have been cut off to a man, had not General Gage, luckily recollecting, that born of Britons, the&s;e Yankees might &s;till perhaps retain &s;ome of the old <HI>lion's fire,</HI> &s;ent on 2,000 men to &s;upport, if nece&s;&s;ary, his troops. This reinforcement met the poor fellows, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aint with f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">r and fatigue, and brought them &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ly off to Bo&s;ton.

<P>On the night of June 16, with a view of driving the Briti&s;h from Bo&s;ton, the Provincial Generals &s;ent a body of fifteen hun|dred men, to throw up &s;ome works on Bunker's hill. Next morning General Gage pu&s;hed off a detachment three thou&s;and &s;trong, with a &s;uitable train of artillery, to di&s;lodge them. The attack was made with great fury on the part of the Briti&s;h, while the Americans did not return a &s;hot, until the enemy had come up within ten &s;teps of the works. A well directed and mo&s;t horrid fire then took place. The Briti&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ell back. Their gallant offi|cers led them a &s;econd time to the charge; a &s;econd fire equally clo&s;e and deadly, drove them back again. But, led on a third time, by dint of bayonet they at length carried the works; and the Americans de&s;titute of that weapon&punc; were obliged, after an ob&s;tinate re&s;tance, to quit their little dirt fort, the <HI>ever green</HI> grave of the immortal Warren, and many more of weeping Liberty's martyred &s;ons. On the other hand, the Briti&s;h drew back to town with <HI>&s;olemn &s;tep and &s;low,</HI> having nearly one half of their whole detachment killed and wounded.</P>
<P>The bloody Rubicon was now pa&s;&s;ed, and Congre&s;s, having clo&s;ed with the Briti&s;h in an awful appeal to the &s;word, &s;aw the nece&s;&s;ity of appointing a <HI>Commander in chief.</HI> In a moment the great name of Wa&s;hington was buzzed from Georgia to New Hamp&s;hire. Congre&s;s ha&s;tened to meet the wi&s;h of the nation; and Wa&s;hington was unanimou&s;ly elected Commander in chief of the armies of his country. On the third day of July&punc; 1775, he arrived at the continental camp near Bo&s;ton, where he was received with great joy, after having been treated on his way through the &s;tates, with all the attention due to that great and virtuous man, to whom, under God, the whole continent looked for &s;afety and freedom.

<P>In the &s;pring of 1776, Wa&s;hington gave orders to erect on the heights near Bo&s;ton, three large batteries, who&s;e heavy fire both of balls and bombs &s;oon rendered the town &s;o intolerably hot, that General Gage was glad to evacuate it on the 17th of March, when Wa&s;hington marched in with the honours of a triumph, and was welcomed by the people and by the &s;tate a&s;&s;embly, as Heaven's agent of their deliverance. In con&s;equence of &s;ome di&s;turbances, this year in Carolina in favour of the mini&s;try, Sir Peter Parker was di&s;patched with nine &s;hips of war, from fifty to twenty guns each, with a large land force commanded by Clinton and Corn|wallis, to make an attempt on Charle&s;ton the capital of South Ca|rolina. Before the &s;hips could be brought to pay their re&s;pects to the town, they mu&s;t, it &s;eems, pa&s;s a little <HI>fort</HI> on Sullivan's i&s;land. This, however, being defended only by the raw militia, was hardly looked on as any ob&s;tacle. Happily for America, Wa&s;h|ington h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d committed the command of it to General Moultrie. About ten o'clock, June 28th, Sir Peter Parker having brought his &s;hips of war clo&s;e along &s;ide the fort, began a tremendous can|nonade upon it, not without expecting to &s;ee the militia fly, like frightened rats from an old barn on fire. But, very contrary to his hopes, the Provincials &s;tood their ground as though they grew to the &s;oil, and levelling their eighteen pounders with good aim, they bored the mini&s;terial &s;hips through and through at every fire. Their third broad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ide cut the &s;prings of the Commodore's cables, &s;o that &s;winging around, &s;tern on, towards the fort, &s;he was raked fore and aft, mo&s;t dreadfully. The &s;laughter on board the &s;hips was very great. The quarter-deck of the Bri&s;tol (the Com|modore's &s;hip) was at one time cleared of every &s;oul, except the Commodore him&s;elf, who&s;e &s;mall clothes were rudely torn off by a cannon ball.

<P>About this time the great que&s;tion of <HI>independence,</HI> was propo&s;ed in Congre&s;s.

God Admighty grant us virtue enough, for ever to live &s;o!!</P>
<P>A few days after this, Lord Howe came upon the coa&s;t with a huge fore&s;t of men of war and tran&s;ports, &s;hading far and wide the frightened ocean, and bearing nearly forty thou&s;and men, Briti&s;h He&s;&s;ians, and Waldeckers. Suppo&s;ing that this had intimidated the American commander, Lord Howe wrote a letter to him, di|rected <HI>"to George Wa&s;hington,</HI> <ABBR><HI>E&s;q.</HI></ABBR>" This Wa&s;hington refu&s;ed to receive, looking on it as an in&s;ult to Congre&s;s, under whom he had the honour to bear the commi&s;&s;ion of Commander in Chief, and &s;hould have been addre&s;&s;ed as &s;uch. General Howe then &s;ent an officer to conver&s;e with him on the &s;ubject of <HI>reconciliation.</HI> Hav|ing heard what he had to &s;ay, Wa&s;hington replied, "by what has yet appeared, &s;ir, you have no power but to grant <HI>pardons;</HI> but we, who have committed no fault, want no pardons, for we are fighting only for our rights, as the de&s;cendants of Engli&s;h|men."</P>
<P>The unfortunate defeat, of Long I&s;land, now took place, on Augu&s;t 28th, which though the <HI>hotte&s;t</HI> day in the <HI>year,</HI> had like to have been the <HI>freezing point</HI> in the American affairs. For, on this day, the Briti&s;h, with an infinite &s;uperiority of force, after having defeated the Americans with great lo&s;s, were inve&s;ting the &s;lender remains of their army, and had actually broke ground within &s;ix hundred yards of the little redoubt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> that feebly covered their front. Soon as it was dark Wa&s;hington ordered the troops to convey their baggage and artillery to the water fide, whence it was tran&s;ported over a broad ferry all night long, with amazing &s;ilence and order. Providentially a thick fog continued next morning till ten o'clock; When that pa&s;&s;ed away, and the &s;un broke out, the Briti&s;h were equally &s;urpri&s;ed and enraged to &s;ee the rear guard with the la&s;t of the baggage, in their boats and out of all danger.</P>
<P>Lord Howe, &s;uppo&s;ing that &s;uch a run of mi&s;fortunes mu&s;t have put Congre&s;s into a good humour to think about <HI>peace,</HI> &s;ignified a willingne&s;s to have a <HI>grand talk</HI> on the &s;ubject. Congre&s;s &s;ent

Towards the clo&s;e of this trying campaign, it is a fact that Wa&s;hington had not 3000 men, and even the&s;e were &s;o de&s;titute of <HI>nece&s;&s;aries,</HI> that nothing but their love and veneration of him kept them together.

But Jehovah the God of Ho&s;ts was with him, and o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t-times in the ear of the &s;lumbering hero, his voice was heard, <HI>"fear not, for I am with thee, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e not di&s;mayed for I am thy god."</HI> Hence under all the di&s;heartening circum&s;tances of this campaign, Wa&s;hington not only kept up his own &s;pirits, but cheer'd tho&s;e of his drooping comrades. <HI>"Never de&s;pond, my friends, &s;aid he, let matters come to the wor&s;t, we can but retire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ver the mountains, whence we &s;hall never lack opportunities to har|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;s, and finally to expel the enemies of our country."</HI> Hearing his officers talking one day about the gloomine&s;s of the American affairs he humourou&s;ly cla&s;ped his neck with his hands, and &s;aid with a &s;mile, <HI>"I really cannot believe yet that my neck was ever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> for a halter."</HI></P>
<P>For four months during the &s;ummer and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of 79, the Ameri|cans had been obliged to retreat before the enemy, who had now completely over-run the Jer&s;eys, filling every town and hamlet with their victorious Red Coats. Wa&s;hington hovered around them waiting for an opportunity to &s;trike. An opportunity &s;oon offered. Learning that the enemy at Trenton, (in number about 2000, chiefly He&s;&s;ians) were lulled into that &s;tate of &s;ecurity which frequent victories and a contempt of an enemy, too naturally in|&s;pire; he formed the de&s;ign to &s;urpri&s;e them. Chri&s;tmas night (76) was pitched on for the purpo&s;e.

<P>"<HI>My brave Countrymen,</HI> now is the the important moment to &s;trike a blow, which, however incon&s;iderable in appearance, may draw after it con&s;equences the mo&s;t de&s;irable and glorious.

<HI>liberty,</HI> and for <HI>life.</HI> For my own part, I &s;olemnly vow to God, that I will never &s;urvive a defeat, if that defeat be owing to any inattention to your welfare." He would have proceeded, but was interrupted by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ager cries of his men&mdash;<HI>Lead us on; lead us on to the enemy."</HI> In an in&s;tant, like lightning, they came up with the out guards, and pouring in their fire, drove them back into to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n, &s;eized their artillery, and were on the eve of di&s;charging on their main body, a &s;torm of cannon and mu&s;quet balls, when they prudently threw down their arms and cried out for quarter. The brave col. Rhal, with 40 of his men were killed, and 1000 taken pri&s;oners. The re&s;t, at the beginning of the <HI>rumpus,</HI> took down the road to Bordentown, and &s;o <HI>cleared</HI> them&s;elves. If Ewing and Cadwallader could but have cro&s;&s;ed the river, and &s;eized the Trenton bridge according to Wa&s;hington's orders, the whole of the Briti&s;h forces at Trenton, Bordentown and Bur|lington, would have been as completely taken as ever was a gang of partridges in a fowler's net. However, this bold &s;troke threw gen. Howe into &s;uch a tremor, that he in&s;tantly called off all his cantonments from the Delaware to Brun&s;wick and Amboy, within the welcome &s;ight and &s;mell of their men of war.</P>
<P>Tho' this victory was gained on the 26th of December, and Wa&s;hington, in order to animate his country men, had marched his pri&s;oners to Philadelphia, yet we find him again, on the 1&s;t of Ja|nuary, acro&s;s the angry Delaware, and rai&s;ing aloft his Country's flag, bold-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> over the heights of Trenton.

<P>The great name of Wa&s;hington imparted its u&s;ual animation to his troops. The enemy gave way in all quarters, and were pur|&s;ued 4 miles. The victors returned with 400 pri&s;oners; the bay|onet had &s;topp'd 120 on the field. But they fell not alone. The Gallant Mercer and 63 of his brave countrymen &s;leep with them. But the &s;tri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e of the heroes was but for a moment; and they have

<P>The Briti&s;h officers gave our Wa&s;hington full credit for &s;uch fine &s;trokes of general&s;hip, and began to look thoughtful whenever his name was mentioned.</P>
<P>The enemy now (January 15th.) drew in all their forces to win|ter quarters at Brun&s;wick, where Wa&s;hington continued to thin their number by cutting off their foraging parties; &s;o that every load of hay or di&s;h of &s;prouts they got, was at the price of blood.</P>
<P>Thus gloriou&s;ly, in ten days, was turn'd the tide of victory in favor of America, by him whom heaven, in mercy, not to America alone, but to Britain and to the world, had rai&s;ed up to found here a wide empire of liberty and virtue. The character of Wa&s;h|ington was exalted to the highe&s;t pitch even throughout <HI>Europe,</HI> where he was generally &s;tiled the American Fabius, from the fa|mous Roman general of that name who oppo&s;ed Hannibal with &s;ucce&s;s. A di&s;tinction to which he was ju&s;tly entitled, from the invincible firmne&s;s with which he rejected every bait and fine&s;&s;e of the Briti&s;h generals; as al&s;o, from that admirable judgment with which he &s;uited the defence of his country to the genius and abilities of the people, and to the natural advantages of the coun|try it&s;elf; thereby not allowing the enemy to profit by their great &s;uperiority of <HI>numbers, di&s;cipline,</HI> and <HI>artillery,</HI> and con&s;tantly cutting them off by &s;kirmi&s;hes and &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>The mini&s;terial plan for this year (1777) was to reduce the Americans, by cutting off all communication between the northern and &s;outhern &s;tates!! To effect this, general Howe, with 20,000 men, was to go round from New-York to the head of Elk, and thence march on, due north, thro' Philadelphia, while general Bur|goyne, with 10,000 men, &s;etting out from Canada, was to pa&s;s along down the lakes, and thence due &s;outh to meet his brother Howe; the &s;trait line, formed by the junction of the&s;e two gentle|men, was to po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;uch virtue, that, it was &s;uppo&s;ed, no American could ever be found hardy enough to &s;et foot over it!!</P>
<P>Accordingly, July 23, general Howe left Sandy Hook, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ailed up the Che&s;eapeake, and landing at the, mouth of <HI>Elk River</HI> marched on with but little interruption, except at Brandy wine, to Philadelphia. Into this elegant city, on the 26th of September 77, he entered in triumph; fondly &s;uppo&s;ing, that, in America as in Europe, the capture of the city, was the &s;ame thing as the re|duction of the country. But in&s;tead of finding him&s;elf ma&s;ter of this great continent, who&s;e Rattle Snakes alone, in the hand of heaven, could &s;courge his pre&s;umption; it was with no &s;mall diffi|culty he could keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion even of the little village of German|town. For on the morning of the 4th of October, Wa&s;hington made an attack on him with &s;uch judgment and fury, that his

troops gave way in every quarter. <HI>"The tumult, di&s;order</HI> and <HI>di&s;pair</HI> in the <HI>Briti&s;h Army,</HI> &s;ays Wa&s;hington, <HI>were unparelled.</HI> But in the very moment of the mo&s;t deci&s;ive and glorious victory, when &s;ome of the Provincial regiments had more pri&s;oners than men, the Americans began to <HI>retreat!!</HI> Wa&s;hington's grief and mortification, were inexpre&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>But while he was annoying the enemy by land, he did not lo&s;e &s;ight of their fleet, which was now forcing its way up the Dela|ware, to keep open to the army a channel of &s;upplies. They ar|rived without mole&s;tation, within 8 miles of Philadelphia, at a mar&s;h called Mud-I&s;land. On this poor harmle&s;s &s;pot, the fitte&s;t however that nature in this peaceful land of Friends could furni&s;h, Wa&s;hington had ordered a fort to be thrown up, the command of which with 230 men, he a&s;&s;igned to lieutenant col. Sam. Smith. On the ea&s;tern or Jer&s;ey &s;ide of the river, at a place called Red Bank, he ordered a &s;trong redoubt; the command of which with 205 men, was given to Col. Greene. The&s;e, with &s;ome chevaux de frize &s;unk in the river, and a few gallies, formed all the bar|rier that Wa&s;hington could pre&s;ent again&s;t the Briti&s;h navy. The &s;trength of this barrier, was &s;oon put to a fiery trial. Great pre|parations were made to attack the Americans, at the &s;ame in&s;tant, both by land and water. Count Donop; with a ho&s;t of He&s;&s;ians, was &s;ent over to be in readine&s;s to attack Red Bank, while the tide of flood, groaning under their enormous weight, brought up the men of war. The morning was &s;till, and the heavens overea&s;t with &s;ad clouds, as of nature &s;ympathi&s;ing with her children, and ready to drop &s;howers of cele&s;tial pity on their &s;trifes. No &s;ooner had the &s;hips floated up within three cables length of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ort, than they began a mo&s;t tremendous cannonade: while cannon ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s and fire tailed bombs, like Comets, fell upon it thick as hail. The gallant Smith and his myrmidons &s;tood the &s;hock to a miracle, and like men fighting under the eye of their Wa&s;hington, drove the two and thirty pounders thro' them with &s;uch &s;pirit and &s;ucce&s;s, that, in a little time the Augu&s;ta, a heavy 64 gun &s;hip, took fire and blew up, the horrid balloon of the greate&s;t part of the crew. Another &s;hip, called the Merlin or <HI>Black Bird,</HI> &s;oon got on the wing and followed the Augu&s;ta.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame moment, col. Donop, with his He&s;&s;ians, made a gal|lant attack on the fort at Red Bank. After a few and well direct|ed fires, Greene and his men artfully retired from the <HI>out-works.</HI> The enemy now &s;uppo&s;ing the day <HI>their own,</HI> ru&s;hed on in va&s;t numbers along a large opening in the fort, and within twenty &s;teps of a ma&s;ked battery of 18 pounders loaded with grape &s;hot and &s;pike nails. All at once, Hell it&s;elf &s;eemed to open before their affrighted view. But their pains and their terrors were but for a moment. Together down they &s;unk by hundreds, into the &s;weet &s;lumbers of death, &s;carcely &s;en&s;ible of the fatal blow that &s;truck them.</P>

<P>After &s;ix weeks of infinite fatigue, with great lo&s;s of men and money, the Briti&s;h forced a pa&s;&s;age large enough for their provi&s;ion &s;hips, to Philadelphia, where general Howe and his officers held their balls this winter; while 16 miles di&s;tant, the great Wa&s;hing|ton, well plea&s;ed with his campaign, retired and hutted it at Val|ley Forge.</P>

General Burgoyne with 10,000 veterans, be|&s;ides a ho&s;t of Canadians and Indians, left Canada in June, and came pouring down from the lakes with an impet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;ity that &s;wept every thing before it. The hatchets of the Indians were drunk with American blood. No age, no &s;ex could &s;often them. The widow's wail, the virgin's &s;hriek, and infant's trembling cry, was mu&s;ic in their ears. In cold blood they &s;truck their cruel tomo|hawks into the defencele&s;s head of a Mi&s;s M'Rae, a beautiful girl who was that very day to have been married.

The fir&s;t check given to Burgoyne's career, was at Bennington. Hearing that the Americans had laid up large provi&s;ions in that town, he detached a colonel Baum with 600 Germans to &s;urpri&s;e it; and at the &s;ame time, po&s;ted colonel Breyman in the neighbour|hood, with an equal number, to &s;upport him if nece&s;&s;ary. Find|ing the place too well guarded either for &s;urpri&s;e or &s;torm, Baum fortified him&s;elf at a little di&s;tance, and &s;ent back for Breyman. The American commander, the brave general Starke, thinking the&s;e enemies fully enough, at lea&s;t, not wi&s;hing for any more, &s;allied out and with great fury attacked Baum's intrenchments. At the fir&s;t on&s;et, the Canadians and Briti&s;h mark&s;men took to their heels, and left the poor Germans in the lurch. After a gal|lant re&s;i&s;tance, Baum was mortally wounded, and his brave coun|trymen killed or taken to a man. In the mean time, Breymen, who had not heard a &s;yllable of all this, arrived at the place of action, where, in&s;tead of the cheering huzzas of joyful friends, he was &s;aluted, on all hands, with the deadly whizzing of rifle-bullets. After receiving a few clo&s;e and &s;corching fires, the Ger|mans were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ain to try their &s;hanks. The enemy lo&s;t in the&s;e two engagements not le&s;s than 800 men, in killed, wounded, and pri|&s;oners.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time, all their forts on the lakes were &s;urpri&s;ed&mdash;Colonel St. Leger was defeated at fort Stanwix&mdash;The Indians began to de&s;ert&mdash;Arnold and Morgan were coming up like moun|tain-&s;torms&mdash;and the militia from all quarters, were pouring in. Burgoyne began to be alarmed, and wrote to New-York for help; but, finding that Clinton could give him none, and that the &s;alva|tion of his army depended on them&s;elves, he gallantly determin|ed, on the 7th of October, (77) to &s;take his all on the ca&s;t of a general battle.</P>
<P>His army, in high &s;pirits, was formed within a mile of the Ame|rican camp. Burgoyne him&s;elf, with the flower of the Briti&s;h troops compo&s;ed the centre; Brigadier Gneneral Frazer com|manded the left; the Germans headed by Major Generals Phillips and Reid&s;del, and Colonel Breyman, formed the right; with a fine train of artillery, flying colours, and a full roll of martial mu&s;ic, from wing to wing the towering heroes moved. On the other hand, <HI>fired</HI> with the love of liberty and their country, the Americans poured out by thou&s;ands, eager for the glorious con|te&s;t. The action began by a mo&s;t furious attack on the centre of the Briti&s;h army, and extending along the left wing. The Grena|diers behaved with their u&s;ual gallanty, but were obliged to give way. Perceiving that they were &s;inking under the weight of the American fire, Gates ordered a &s;trong body to march <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ank, while Morgan, with a heavy reinforcement, ha&s;ten|ed to the left to decide the action there. The&s;e charges was made with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that the enemy was thrown into the

utmo&s;t confu&s;ion. To &s;ave them from total de&s;truction, the brave General Frazer flew to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. In this attempt he lo&s;t his life and great numbers of his men were &s;lain. The &s;ituation of this part of the Royal army becoming now exceedingly critical, and the danger encrea&s;ing every moment, a retreat was ordered. But &s;carcely had they entered their camp, when the Americans &s;tormed it with all the fury of Lions: with trailed arms ru&s;hing to the charge through a &s;evere fire of grape &s;hot and mu&s;quetry. The Briti&s;h fought with equal de&s;peration, for their <HI>all</HI> was at &s;take, and the Americans, like a whelming flood, were bur&s;ting over their en|trenchments, and hand to hand with arguments of bloody &s;teel, were pleading the cau&s;e of ages yet unborn. For &s;ome time, the mortal &s;trife was maintained on both &s;ides, with a bravery that was never exceeded. But in that moment of danger and of glory, the impetuous Arnold who led them on, was dangerou&s;ly wound|ed and forced to retire, and &s;everal regiments of Briti&s;h Infantry pouring in to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their gallant comrades, the Ameri|cans, after many hard &s;truggles, were finally repul&s;ed. In ano|ther quarter, where the &s;trength of the Germans fought, the Ame|ricans led on by Morgan, carried the entrenchments &s;word in hand. Colonel Breymen, with the greate&s;t part of his country|men, was killed, and their baggage, tents and artillery, all fell in|to the hands of the Conquerors. This was a bloody day to both armies; but &s;o peculiarly di&s;heartening to the Briti&s;h, that they were obliged to retreat that night to Saratoga, where, in a few days (on the 13th of October 1777.) they &s;urrendered to Gates and the Americans, by whom they were treated with a genero&s;ity that perfectly a&s;toni&s;hed them. For when the Briti&s;h were marched out to lay down their arms, there was not an American to be &s;een! They had all nobly retired, for a moment, as if unwilling to give the pain, <HI>even to their enemies,</HI> of being &s;pectators of &s;o humilia|ting a &s;cene!

<P>Thus gloriou&s;ly for America, ended the campaign of 77. 78 began as au&s;piciou&s;ly.

On the 18th of June, the Briti&s;h army, now under the command of Clinton, evacuated Philadelphia for New-York. The figure they made on the road had &s;omething the air of the <HI>&s;ublime;</HI> for their baggage, loaded hor&s;es, and carriages, formed a line not le&s;s than twelve miles in length. General Wa&s;hington, who&s;e eye, like that of the &s;acred Dragon, was always open and fixed upon the enemies of America, immediately cro&s;&s;ed the Delaware after them&mdash;pu&s;hed on detached corps to ob&s;truct their advance&mdash;gall their flanks&mdash;and fall on their rear, while he him&s;elf moved on with the body of the army. By the 27th, Clinton had got on as far as Monmouth, and Wa&s;hington's troops were clo&s;e on his flank and rear. Next morning he ordered general Lee with 5000 men, to begin the attack; him&s;elf moving on bri&s;kly to &s;upport him. But to his a&s;toni&s;hment, as he advanced, he met Lee re|treating, and the enemy impetuou&s;ly pur&s;uing. Here Wa&s;hington was &s;een in all his &s;plendor; for the moment of danger and confu|&s;ion was always the orb in which he &s;hown the brighte&s;t.

The enemy finding them&s;elves now warmly oppo&s;ed in front, made an attempt to turn his left flank, but were gallantly attacked and driven back. They then made a rapid pu&s;h to the right, but the brave Green with a choice body of troops and artillery, repul&s;ed them with con&s;iderable &s;laughter. At the &s;ame in&s;tant Wayne advanced with his <HI>Game Chickens,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Every body has heard of Paoli.</NOTE> and poured in &s;o &s;evere and well directed a fire, that the enemy were glad to get back to their defiles. Morgan's rifles were full hot that day. Wa&s;hington and his heroe's lay upon their arms all night, re&s;olved to fall on the enemy the moment they &s;hould attempt their retreat next morning. But during the night they moved off in <HI>&s;ilence,</HI> and got &s;uch a &s;tart that Wa&s;h|ington thought it dangerous in &s;uch hot weather, to make a pu&s;h after them. Wa&s;hington lo&s;t fifty-eight killed&mdash;140 wounded. The Briti&s;h had 249 killed, and the wounded in proportion.

<P>In September 1780, an attempt was made to take off our Wa&s;h|ington, and by means which I can hardly believe the old Briti&s;h Lion was ever well plea&s;ed with.

hurried it over, and after a gentle reprimand of Arnold, gave him the command of We&s;t-point with a large body of Ame|rican troops. The hi&s;tory of Arnold's embarra&s;&s;ments and his quarrel with his countrymen, &s;oon got down to New-York to the Briti&s;h commander, who, well knowing the tickli&s;h &s;ituation of a <HI>proud</HI> man caught on the horns of <HI>poverty,</HI> &s;ends him up a Major Andre with money in his pocket. The Major, by means yet un|known to the public, got near enough to Arnold to <HI>probe</HI> him, and, alas! found him, both in principle and pur&s;e, hollow as an exhau&s;ted receiver, and very willing to be filled up with Engli&s;h guineas.

<P>Morgan bravely &s;tood his ground, and, at a place called the Cowpens, drew up his men with mo&s;t admirable judgement.&mdash;He paraded his Militia in a large field, but near a piece of thick woods: this was made to appear as his whole force; but clo&s;e behind them and in the edge of the woods, he concealed his Regulars. Scarce was this arrangement made, before the thundering rattle of Tarleton's drums was heard, and the Enemy, Hor&s;e and Foot, poured in on the other &s;ide of the field in all their glittering &s;teel.

The Militia &s;uffered them to advance within a hundred yards, and, then gave them a well directed fire, and, according to orders, <HI>broke,</HI> to gain the woods, and form behind the Regulars. The Briti&s;h &s;u&s;|po&s;ing Morgan's whole force now put to the rout, advanced with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity that Tarleton's hor&s;e had like to have cut down &s;ome of the fugitives before they reached the woods. Su&s;pecting no danger nigh, and ru&s;hing on as to certain victory, the enemy were now within ten &s;teps of Morgan's riflemen, with every man his finger on the fatal trigger, and his unerring &s;ight drawn upon his brothers heart. Sons of Columbia! let the curtain drop: for who, without weeping eyes, can behold the horrid tragedy that en|&s;ued, or the pale cloud of &s;hrieking gho&s;ts that &s;uddenly a&s;cended from the bloody field!

But while Clinton was in daily expectation of a vi&s;it from him, Wa&s;h|ington and his army, now acro&s;s the Delaware, were in full &s;tretch to the South, darkening the day with their clouds of rolling du&s;t.

On the la&s;t of Septem|ber, Wa&s;hington &s;at down before York with about 100 pieces of heavy artillery.

<P>At the conclu&s;ion of the war this truly illu&s;trious man, with a &s;oul far &s;uperior to the low ambition of governing, &s;urrendered up to Congre&s;s all the authority with which he had been inve&s;ted. Never was there a more glorious di&s;play of the power which vir|tue po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es over the human heart, than on that memorable oc|ca&s;ion. Congre&s;s was then &s;itting at Annapolis. Wa&s;hington had informed them of his intention to re&s;ign on the following day. The hou&s;e was crouded with the mo&s;t re&s;pectoble charac|ters in the univer&s;e.

The &s;ight of this great man acting in &s;o generous, &s;o godlike a manner, produced an effect beyond the power of words to expre&s;s.

But indeed it was not for an angel of God to plea&s;e &s;uch oppo&s;ite parties, one of whom was furiou&s;ly clamorous for a war with Britain, the other as keen &s;et on a game of logger heads with France. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e violent commotions, WASHING|TON turned not to the right hand nor to the left to humour any party. Placed by his country at the &s;acred helm of her govern|ment, with no pole &s;tar but her good, no compa&s;s but duty, like a brave and heaven-a&s;&s;i&s;ted pilot, he &s;teered our great national bark &s;afely thro' the Scylla and Charybdis, the dangerous rocks and whirlpools of French and Engli&s;h politics.</P>
<P>Little minds are dazzled with pomp and &s;how, to &s;uch, WASH|INGTON mu&s;t have appeared little le&s;s than a God, when at York amid&s;t the thunder and lightning of the war, the Briti&s;h Lion crouched before him, and Cornwallis and Tarleton with &s;even thou&s;and veteran troops, grounded their arms and acknowledged his &s;uperiority.

And however this wi&s;e, this beneficent conduct of his may have been reprobated by &s;ome, yet the day is at hand, when he, whom all the clamours of a too pa&s;&s;ionate party, could not per|&s;uade to let &s;lip the hell hounds of war to fea&s;t on the cries and blood of mankind, will be revered and beloved as one of the Guar|dian Angels of the human race: Yes, when tho&s;e unfeeling Ru|lers, who, to monopolize the &s;ale of &s;ugars and of &s;pices, could without remor&s;e, deluge the earth and dye the ocean with human gore, &s;hall be remembered only to be accur&s;ed, then &s;hall the name of WASHINGTON &s;ound in the delighted ears of po&s;terity, as the name of &s;ome gentle angel of God &s;ent on errands of love to his country: when bloody Kings and Conquerors, with all their eclat, &s;hall have pa&s;&s;ed away like the black &s;torms of night which de&s;o|lated nations in their cour&s;e, then &s;hall our WASHINGTON, like

<P>Were it not &s;o, the prince of devils would out-top the topmo&s;t hero of them all, for he had wit to out-wit Solomon, and cou|rage enough to throw down his black gauntlet to the Almighty. No, no, to be truly great, a man mu&s;t have not only great talents but great virtues, and the&s;e mu&s;t have nerves of &s;teel too, to bear him &s;trongly up till death, for if he &s;hould ever turn a&s;ide to vice, farewell for ever his reputation as a hero. Hence when Epami|nondas was a&s;ked, which was the greate&s;t man him&s;elf, or Pelop|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">s, (another illu&s;trious character of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">) he replied, "wait till we are dead," thus implying, that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> all of heroi&s;m, depends on a per&s;everance till death, in virtue and in great ac|tions.

alas! for lack of WASHINGTON's religious principles, he &s;oon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ell, like Lucifer, from a heaven of glory into an aby&s;s of never ending infamy. But why &s;hould I &s;ummon the Arnolds, the Cromwells, the Bacons, the Cae&s;ars and Alexanders of the earth, to give &s;ad evidence that no valour, no genius <HI>alone</HI> can make men <HI>great?</HI> Do we not <HI>daily</HI> meet with melancholy in&s;tances of youth, lovely as innocence, &s;parkling as wit, and promi&s;ing to the full of their fond parents wi&s;hes, who, yet, merely for lack of religion, &s;oon make &s;hipwreck of all this precious cargo; &s;acrificing their gold to gamblers, their health to harlots, and their glory to grog; making con&s;cience their cur&s;e, this life a purgatory, and the next a hell!! In fact a man though of the greate&s;t talents, without religion, is but like a gorgeous &s;hip without balla&s;t: highly paint|ed and with flowing canvas, &s;he launches out upon the deep, and during a &s;mooth &s;ea and gentle breezes, &s;he moves along &s;tately as the pride of ocean; but &s;oon as the &s;tormy winds de&s;cend, and the blackning billows begin to roll, &s;uddenly &s;he is over&s;et and di&s;ap|pears for ever. But who is this coming thus gloriou&s;ly along, with ma&s;ts towering to heaven, and his &s;ails white looming like the mountain of &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ows, the &s;trength of ocean roars beneath his prow, while his cour&s;e through the waves is as the cour&s;e of the mighty Leviathan? who is it but the &s;ervant of God, the friend of man, and guardian angel of his country! who is it but the pride of Columbia, WASHINGTON the great and good, who&s;e talents like the &s;ails of a mighty &s;hip, &s;pread far and wide catching the gales of heaven, while his capacious &s;oul, &s;tored with the rich balla&s;t of religion, remains firm and un&s;haken as the ponderous rock?

<P>Never perhaps, had human being a more vivid &s;en&s;e than WASHINGTON, of that great truth which lies at the bottom of all our religion and of all our joys; I mean, the belief of a <HI>particular providence.</HI> His &s;trong, vigorous mind clearly di&s;cerned that migh|ty God, whom nature through all her wondrous works proclaims aloud: that mighty God who fills the heaven of heavens with his glory, yet every where pre&s;ent with his works, paints the humble <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">illy of the vale, and feeds with parent care the crying tenants of the &s;parrow's ne&s;t; that mighty God who is thus regardful of his <HI>meanest</HI> creatures, mu&s;t, &s;urely, be more regardful of man than of millions of &s;parrows.

firm belief. And this through life animated his hopes, &s;weeten|ed his re&s;ignation, taught him humility, and inflamed his grati|tude. To this ever pre&s;ent parent and pre&s;erver of men.

When called by his country in 1775, to lead her freedom-loving &s;ons again&s;t the arms of Britain, what charming mode&s;ty, what noble &s;elf-di&s;tru&s;t, what pious confidence in heaven, appeared in all his an&s;wers! How widely different from the behaviour of Suwarrow on a &s;imilar occa&s;ion! When that butcher of the Poles was appointed by the Emperor of Ru&s;&s;ia, to command his forces again&s;t the French, he replied, "I thank your Highne&s;s, and <HI>will beat the French!!</HI>" Vain mortal! Shall the Father of mercies de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">rt the &s;ouls that he has created, let drop his everla&s;ting reins of government, and &s;uffer a Demon to break the nations before him like a potter's ve&s;&s;el! No! WASHINGTON thought not &s;o. Firmly per&s;uaded that he who formed "this univer&s;al frame thus wondrous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">air," formed it on &s;ome great plan worthy of infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, he wi&s;ely concluded, that God would never give to <HI>another his glory,</HI> the glory of governing it: nor allow to angels, men, or devils to act but in &s;ub&s;erviency to his adorable de&s;ign.

<P>And after having come near the clo&s;e of this the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible and virtuous &s;peech ever made to a &s;en&s;ible and virtuous repre&s;entation of a free people, he adds&mdash;<Q>I &s;hall take my pre&s;ent leave; but, not, without re&s;orting <HI>once more</HI> to the benign parent of the human race, in humble &s;upplication, that, &s;ince he has been plea&s;ed to favor the American people with opportunities for deliberating with perfect tranquillity; and di&s;po&s;itions for deciding with un|parallelled unanimity on a form of government for the &s;ecurity of their union, and the advancement of their happine&s;s; &s;o his divine ble&s;&s;ings may be equally con&s;picuous in the enlarged views, the temperate con&s;ultations, and the wi&s;e mea&s;ures, on which the &s;ucce&s;s of this government mu&s;t depend.</Q></P>
<P>But if the conduct of our WASHINGTON was &s;o lovely in the eyes of angels and good men, becau&s;e &s;o re&s;pectful to the great pa|rent, in <HI>public</HI> it was not le&s;s &s;o in <HI>private</HI> life. The learned and fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">tious MR. LEE MASSEY, long rector of the pari&s;h in which WASHINGTON lived, has often told me, that he never knew &s;o con&s;tant a churchman as WASHINGTON. "And his behaviour in the hou&s;e of his God was &s;o exceedingly decent, added the

&s;ame Rev. gentleman, that it produced the happie&s;t effect on my whole congregation, and greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ted and comforted me in my moralizing labours; and he always made it a point to bring with him to church whatever friends happened to be at his hou&s;e!! The amiable Judge Harri&s;on, &s;ecretary to Wa&s;hington, u&s;ed often to &s;ay, that, <HI>whenever the General could be spared from camp on the Sabbath, he never &s;ailed riding out to some neighbouring church, to make one of those who were publicly worshipping the great Creator.</HI></P>
<P>And while he re&s;ided in Philadelphia, as Pre&s;ident of the Uni|ted States, his chearful and con&s;tant attendance on divine &s;ervice, was &s;uch as to convince all who were de&s;titute of religion and true <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;te, that he deemed no plea&s;ures equal to tho&s;e of devotion, and no bu&s;ine&s;s a &s;ufficient excu&s;e for neglecting his &s;upreme benefactor.

No wonder that he, whom thou &s;o &s;ignally honored&s;t through life, &s;hould through life, &s;o &s;ignally have honored thee!</P>
<P>The pillars of heaven are not more immoveable than is this great truth; which in WASHINGTON's own language, runs beau|tifully thus&mdash;<Q><HI>there exists in the oeconomy and course of nature an indissoluble union between virtue and happiness; between duty and advantage</HI></Q>&mdash;between religion and glory. For what is re|ligion but a firm belief of the great things of eternity, and a reve|rential, affectionate intercour&s;e between the &s;oul and its almighty Creator? Now what motives could human wit devi&s;e, comparable with the&s;e of religion, to kindle our love, to enrapture our hopes, to alarm our fears, to inflame our ambition, and, in &s;hort, to touch every &s;pring and pa&s;&s;ion of our &s;ouls, in favor of virtue and happine&s;s?</P>
<P>Did the &s;en&s;e of &s;hame, re&s;train Alcibiades from ba&s;e actions in the pre&s;ence of Socrates? Behold, &s;ays religion, a greater than Socrates is here.

<P>Did the ambition of a civic crown animate Scipio to heroic deeds? Religion holds up a crown, at &s;ight of which the laurels of a Cae&s;ar fade to weeds. Does the hope of gain call forth no|ble&s;t indu&s;try and worth? Religion points to trea&s;ures in heaven, compared with which, whole beds of diamonds, and rocks of ma&s;&s;y gold are tra&s;h. Did Titus and Aurelius &s;tudy the happine&s;s of their &s;ubjects, for the &s;ake of this world's fame? Religion di&s;|plays that world of glory, where good kings, who have made their &s;ubjects happy, &s;hall &s;hine like the &s;tars for ever and ever.</P>
<P>Are &s;ubjects withheld from crimes ruinous to &s;ociety, through fear of death? Religion adds infinite horrors to that dread, it warns them of a death both of &s;oul and body, in hell, in torments exqui&s;ite and eternal.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="039062_0034_10138F2871E53180">
In &s;hort, what motives under heaven can re&s;train men from vice and mi&s;ery, or urge them on in full &s;tretch after individual and national happine&s;s, comparable with tho&s;e of Religion? Hence, tho&s;e great Legi&s;lators of nations, Mo&s;es, Lycurgus, and Numa, de&s;ired nothing for their dear countrymen, in com|pari&s;on of Religious Principles. <HI>"I ask not gold for the Spar|tans,</HI> &s;aid Lycurgus, <HI>virtue is better than gold."</HI> The event &s;hewed his wi&s;dom.

<P>Hence, WASHINGTON, in his con&s;ultations for our good, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aid more &s;tre&s;s on religious principles, than on all other means what|ever. <Q>Of all the di&s;po&s;itions and habits which lead to the pro&s;perity of a nation, religion, &s;ays he, is the indi&s;pen&s;able &s;upport.

<P>But &s;ome have &s;aid, and with a &s;erious face too, that a &s;en&s;e of honor is &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve men from ba&s;e actions! O bla&s;|phemy to &s;en&s;e! Do not we daily hear of men of honor, by dice and cards, draining their fellow citizens to the la&s;t guinea, re|ducing them to a dunghill, or driving them to a pi&s;tol? Do not we daily hear of men of honor corrupting their neighours wives and daughters, and then murdering their hu&s;bands and brothers in duels? Bind &s;uch &s;elfi&s;h, &s;uch inhuman beings, by a &s;en&s;e of honor!! Why not bind roaring Lions with a cobweb? "No." exclaims WASHINGTON, <Q>Whatever a &s;en&s;e of honor may do on men of refined education, and on minds of a peculiar &s;truc|ture, rea&s;on and experience both forbid us to expect that na|tional morality can prevail, in exclu&s;ion of religious princi|ples.</Q></P>
<P>Indeed he &s;eems never to have lo&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight of the importance of religion to national &s;afety. When he was told that the Briti&s;h troops at Lexington, on the ever memorable 19th April, 1775, had fired on the Americans and killed &s;everal of them, he re|plied, <Q>I grieve for the death of my Countrymen, but rejoice that the Briti&s;h are &s;till &s;o determined to put God on our &s;ide:</Q> alluding to that noble &s;entiment which he has &s;ince &s;o happily <HI>expressed,</HI> <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <Q>The &s;miles of heaven can never be expected on a nation that di&s;regards the eternal rules of order and right which heaven it&s;elf has ordained.</Q> And truly WASHINGTON had abundant rea&s;on, from his own happy experience, to recom|mend religion &s;o heartily to others. For, as religion never had a more dutiful &s;on than WASHINGTON, &s;o WASHINGTON never had a more generous mother than religion. Setting a&s;ide all tho&s;e &s;ecret comforts and joys with which &s;he refre&s;hed him in his frequent vi&s;its to the great King; &s;etting a&s;ide all tho&s;e in|calculable favors which he received from her at the hands of her cele&s;tial daughters the virtues, that fine health which <HI>rosy-cheek'd temperance</HI> gave him&mdash;that clearne&s;s of head which <HI>genteel sobri|ety</HI> furni&s;hed him&mdash;that firm tone which <HI>blushing chastity</HI> di&s;pen|&s;ed him&mdash;that horn of abundance which <HI>firm <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">erved industry</HI> be|&s;towed

on him&mdash;that tranquillity which <HI>prudence in business,</HI> pre&s;erved to him&mdash;that cheerfulne&s;s which <HI>smiling innocence</HI> pre|&s;ented to him&mdash;that bold undaunted heart which <HI>good conscience</HI> gave him&mdash;I &s;ay, &s;etting a&s;ide the&s;e, and the ten thou&s;and other choice&s;t pre&s;ents which religion &s;ent him by the hands of her daughters the virtues; &s;he threw over him her own venerable mantle, which, like the AEgis of Minerva, makes little men great and great men little le&s;s than gods. It was this mantle of reli|gion which immortalized our WASHINGTON. By in&s;piring e|very body with the profounde&s;t veneration for him as the be&s;t of men, it naturally &s;moothed his way to the &s;upreme command. For when war, that mon&s;ter of hell, came on roaring again&s;t us with all his deaths-heads and garments rolled in blood, we u|nanimou&s;ly elected WASHINGTON our commander in chief, from a natural per&s;ua&s;ion that &s;o good a man mu&s;t be the peculi|ar favorite of heaven, and the fa&s;te&s;t friend of his country. How far this precious in&s;tinct of nature in favor of goodne&s;s, was cor|rect, or how far WASHINGTON's conduct was honorable to re|ligion, and glorious to him&s;elf and country, bright ages to come, and happy nations yet unborn, will, I tru&s;t, declare.</P>
<P>The life of WASHINGTON adds one more to the already innu|merable proofs of the incalculable importance of good character to all men, but e&s;pecially to great men. "Very gladly, &s;aid George Villars, would I give ten thou&s;and pounds for a good character, becau&s;e I could ea&s;ily make thirty thou&s;and pounds by it." But WASHINGTON's good character was worth to him&s;elf and to his country, more thirty thou&s;and pounds than all the Golden Sands of Ganbia, and precious ore of Poto&s;i could furni&s;h! It obtained for him the &s;upreme command of the American armies! a com|mand which his great abilities conducted with &s;uch &s;kill and &s;uc|ce&s;s, that he fully e&s;tabli&s;hed the liberties of his country; and e|rected for him&s;elf a monument who&s;e ba&s;e covers the United States and its &s;ummit reaches the &s;ky: a monument that &s;hall &s;hine in the Cabinets of the Almighty, when the moon has &s;hrouded for e|ver her &s;ilver face, and the great &s;un him&s;elf has cea&s;ed to gladden the earth with his golden beams.</P>
<P>But before I quit this article, permit me to add, (for which I hope his brethren in arms will thank me) that WASHINGTON's piety rendered him one of the brighte&s;t ornaments of his profe&s;&s;ion as a &s;oldier. It in&s;pired him with that HEROIC kind of courage, &s;o honorable to <HI>reason</HI> and to <HI>man,</HI> and &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to a General; that calm deliberate valor, which, even in the madde&s;t rage of bat|tle, enabled him to look coolly on, and improve every advantage which the errors of the enemy offered. Braddock's bloody field
<PB N="34" REF="039062_0037_10138F318AC48FB0">
bears glorious te&s;timony to this. For there in the mid&s;t of hor|rors unparalleled, while profane dram-drinking veterans were flying in every direction, like gun-&s;hot deer, this virtuous youth, unconcerned as Mars, was riding along the line of his Virginia Riflemen, ince&s;&s;antly calling out <Q>well fired, my brave fellows remember the fate of our little army depends now on your rifles,</Q></P>
<P>An officer &s;aid one day at head quarters, that in his opinion a field of battle called for valor not virtue. "There is no call, &s;ir," replied WASHINGTON, <Q>prior to that of virtue, none of com|parable magnitude and importance. By fighting we &s;erve our country; by virtue we &s;erve him who made us, we &s;erve man|kind, we &s;erve our&s;elves and even we &s;erve our country the better in the article of valor. For how a man can fight in a bad cau&s;e and under a guilty con&s;cience, I do not know. Un|der &s;uch circum&s;tances I think I &s;hould be the verie&s;t coward alive; but give me the happine&s;s to live and to fight, &s;o as to have God on my &s;ide, and I hope I &s;hall never know fear.</Q></P>
<P>This is near a-kin to a noble &s;entiment of a great captain in former ages "I fear my God, O Abner, and know no other fear."</P>
<P>The great Gu&s;tavus Adolphus u&s;ed con&s;tantly to &s;ay, that "a &s;oldier always fights the better for being a good man."</P>
<P>WASHINGTON proved to a demon&s;tration that virtue is the &s;oul of courage. No beau ever went with more compo&s;ure to a ball than he did to a battle. Hannibal-like, he was the fir&s;t on the field, and the la&s;t off. Providence, in love to America, made his body bullet-proof, and his great virtues rendered his mind fearle&s;s of fear</P>
<P>His conduct in camp was corre&s;pondent with his principles.&mdash;He was never ab&s;ent from public prayers. And as to his private devotions, we have every evidence &s;ave that of the eye, that they were duly di&s;charged. He who&s;e feelings through life, were &s;o exqui&s;itely alive to duty and propriety, that he could not lie down under the weight of a <HI>hundred pence</HI> due to his neighbour; &s;urely could never have &s;lept under the enormous burden of <HI>ten thousand talents</HI> due to his God.</P>

<P>The next duty to piety is PATRIOTISM, or the LOVE of our COUNTRY.</P>

When Carthage, proud Mi&s;tre&s;s of the Sea, made war, with all her wealth again&s;t the Roman poverty, &s;he found the re&s;ult ve|ry different from her expectations. The rea&s;on is plain. Gold and &s;ilver may ea&s;ily be exhau&s;ted, but public virtue and forti|tude never can. Even after loo&s;ing two hundred and fifty thou|&s;and of their be&s;t troops, the Romans would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> hearken to a|ny terms. <Q>No!

<P>Such was the patrioti&s;m which rai&s;ed the republics of an|cient Greece and Rome to be the Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of the world. And &s;uch, thro' life, was the patrioti&s;m of WASHINGTON. While yet a youth, the tender down hardly formed on his ruddy cheek, he hears that the French and Indians have lifted the tomahawk and are butchering the frontier inhabitants. He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ees the grim ruffians bur&s;ting into the unguarded Cabin.&mdash;The father and the hu&s;band, &s;hot down, lies weltering in his own heart's blood&mdash;while the wretched mother and her helple&s;s little ones, with heart-piercing &s;hrieks, and eyes wild-&s;tarting from their &s;ockets, fly, but fly in vain, from their bloody pur|&s;uers!&mdash;He &s;tarts up burning for vengeance.

Full-nerved with patriot rage, he ru&s;hes upon the murderers of his countrymen, as the bounding Lyon upon the wretch who has invaded his brindled cubs. Bloody were the balls of his rifles in the battle of the roaring Kan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">away, when the painted children of the foe fled to their di&s;tant lands.</P>
<P>And in 1774, when Lord North had re&s;olved, Uzzah-like, to lay his unhallowed hand upon the &s;acred ark of our liberties, then it was that the patrioti&s;m of WASHINGTON broke forth in a blaze of glory to him&s;elf, and of honor to human nature.</P>

Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a princely fortune WASHINGTON might ea&s;i|ly have &s;lipped away from a &s;torm which, indeed, he had very little of <HI>this world's rea&s;on</HI> to per&s;uade him to encounter. For he knew very well what &s;ort of promotion the Scotch Lairds met with in 1745, and had abundant cau&s;e to expect, that, in ca&s;e of equal &s;ucce&s;s, he &s;hould be equally promoted. And be|&s;ides, he had no children for who&s;e dear &s;akes nature might rou&s;e him up to meet &s;uch ri&s;ks. No daughters, meanly &s;tudi|ous of ornaments to plea&s;e the en&s;lavers of their country; no &s;ons to wear the galling chain, and tread lightly in pre&s;ence of her haughty Lordlings. Hence one of his European friends advi&s;ed him to quit a &s;cene of danger to which he had &s;uch &s;lender ties, and fly with him to the &s;afe and plea&s;ant &s;hores of Europe. <Q><HI>What,</HI> replied WASHINGTON, <HI>&s;hall I for&s;ake my mother, becau&s;e &s;he is in danger?</HI></Q> The other ob&s;erved that COL.

<P>The patrioti&s;m of the Roman Emperor, Alexander, has been celebrated through all ages, becau&s;e he was never known to give any place through favour or friend&s;hip, but to employ tho&s;e only whom both him&s;elf and the Senate looked on as the be&s;t qualified to &s;erve the country. In our WASHINGTON we meet this great and hone&s;t Emperor over again.

<P>But of all the virtues that adorned the life of this great man, there is none more worthy of our imitation than his ad|mirable indu&s;try. It is to this virtue in her WASHINGTON, that America &s;tands indebted for &s;ervices pa&s;t calculation; and it is from this virtue, that WASHINGTON him&s;elf, has &s;natched a wreathe of glory that &s;hall never fade away. O that the good genius of America may prevail! That the example of this her favorite &s;on may but be univer&s;ally adopted! Soon &s;hall our land be freed from all tho&s;e &s;loth-begotten Demons which now haunt and torment us! For, whence do all our mi|&s;eries proceed, but from our lack of indu&s;try?

<L>That gen'rous deeds di&s;tingui&s;h ev'ry day.</L></Q></P>
<P>This was the life, this the example &s;et by WASHINGTON. His whole inheritance was but a &s;mall tract of poor broken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">nd in Stafford County, oppo&s;ite to Frederick&s;burg, (where he once lived) and a few Negroes. This appearing utterly in&s;ufficient to tho&s;e purpo&s;es of honor and u&s;efulne&s;s, with the charms of which his mind &s;eems to have been early &s;mitten, he re&s;olved to make up the deficiency by dint of great indu&s;try and oeconomy. For the&s;e virtues how excellent! how rare in youth! WASHINGTON was admirably di&s;tingui&s;hed when but a boy. At a time when many young men have no higher am|bition than a fine coat and a trolic, "<HI>often have I &s;een him,</HI> &s;ays the Reverend Mr. Lee Ma&s;&s;ey, <HI>riding about the country with his &s;urveying in&s;truments at his &s;addle,</HI>" enjoying the dou|ble &s;atisfaction, of obliging his fellow citizens by &s;urveying their lands, and of making money, not meanly to hoard, but generou&s;ly to lend to any <HI>worthy</HI> object that a&s;ked it. This early indu&s;try was one of the fir&s;t &s;teps to WASHINGTON's pre|ferment. It attracted on him the notice and admiration of all his very numerous acquaintance, and, which was &s;till much more in his favor, it gave &s;uch &s;trength to his con&s;titution, &s;uch vigor to his mind, &s;uch an ardor and &s;pirit for adventure, that he was ready, like a young Lion, to leap on any glori|ous enterprize, no matter how difficult or dangerous.

<P>While he was employed in choo&s;ing a place on the Potomak for the Federal City, his indu&s;try was not le&s;s remarkable.

<P>On his farm, his hu&s;bandry of time was equally exemplary. He contemplated a great object; an object worthy of WASH|INGTON. He aimed at teaching his countrymen the art of enriching their lands, and, con&s;equently, of rendering the con|dition of man and bea&s;t more plentiful and happy.

<P>The plea&s;ures and profits ari&s;ing from &s;uch an arrangement, are incalculable.

<P>Full of this greatly-benevolent idea, no wonder that he was &s;o frugal of his time, and that, tho' the mo&s;t ho&s;pitable of all the ho&s;pitable Virginians, he would not &s;uffer the &s;ociety of his deare&s;t friends to take him entirely from his bu&s;ine&s;s.

Long before the &s;un had peeped into the chambers of the &s;luggard, WASHINGTON was on hor&s;eback and out a|mong his over&s;eers and &s;ervants, and neither him&s;elf, nor any about him, were allowed to eat the bread of idlene&s;s.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON'S BENEVOLENCE.</HEAD>
<P>If ever man rejoiced in the divine admini&s;tration, and cordial|ly endeavoured to imitate it, by diffu&s;ing ble&s;&s;ings around him, it was WASHINGTON. Taught by <HI>religion,</HI> that <HI>"God is love,"</HI> and that he mu&s;t, by the laws of his own nature, delight mo&s;t in tho&s;e of his rational creatures who mo&s;t re&s;emble him in love, and in doing good to their brethren.&mdash;Taught by <HI>experience,</HI> that, betwixt <HI>souls,</HI> love is the only principle of <HI>union</HI> and of bli&s;s, which, by uniting our hearts gives us the fulle&s;t and &s;weete&s;t participation of each other's joys, and at the &s;ame time enables us to bear one another's infirmities and injuries, with a brotherly genero&s;ity.&mdash;Taught by <HI>observation</HI> that love is the only co&s;me|tic, or beautifier: that however youth, beauty, and wit may dazzle for a moment, it is goodne&s;s alone that can captivate our hearts forever: convinced, I &s;ay, of the&s;e three precious perqui|&s;ites of love, WASHINGTON &s;eems early to have been &s;mitten with her heavenly charms, and early to have &s;tudied that goodne&s;s which made him &s;o &s;ingularly the delight of all mankind. It was this amiable quality which compleated the character of our WASHINGTON, and by &s;preading over his great virtues and ta|lents the &s;weetly-beaming veil of goodne&s;s, rendered him at once the mo&s;t endearing and venerable of human beings.</P>
<P>The Marquis De Cha&s;tel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ux&punc; who vi&s;ited him in camp, tells us that he was a&s;toni&s;hed and delighted beyond mea&s;ure, to &s;ee this great American living among his officers and men, as a fa|ther among his children, who at once revered and loved him with a filial tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>Bri&s;&s;ot, another famous French traveller, a&s;&s;ures us, that, throughout the continent, every body &s;poke of WASHINGTON as of a father.</P>
<P>This deare&s;t and be&s;t of all appellations, <HI>"The father of his country,"</HI> was the precious fruit of that noble &s;pirit of <HI>benevolence,</HI> which he &s;o carefully cultivated through every age and &s;tage of his life.

that offended Payne, whereupon the <HI>little</HI> gentleman, who, though but a cub in <HI>size,</HI> was the old Lyon in heart, rai&s;ed his &s;turdy hickory, and, at a &s;ingle blow, brought our hero to the ground. Several of WASHINGTON'S officers being pre&s;ent, whipped out their cold Irons in an in&s;tant, and it was looked that there would have been murder off-hand. To make bad wor&s;e; his regiment hearing how he had been &s;erved, bolted out from their barracks, with every man his weapon in his hand, threat|ening dreadful vengeance on tho&s;e who had dared to knock down their Colonel after that &s;ort. Happily for Mr. Payne and his party, WASHINGTON recovered time enough to go out and meet his enraged &s;oldiers, and after thanking them for this expre&s;&s;ion of their concern for him, a&s;&s;ured them that he was not hurt in the lea&s;t, and begged them, as they loved him or their duty, to return peaceably to their barracks. As for him&s;elf, he went to his room, generou&s;ly cha&s;ti&s;ing his imprudence which had thus &s;truck out a &s;park, that had like to have thrown the whole town into a flame. Finding, on mature reflection, that he had been the aggre&s;&s;or, he re&s;olved to make Mr. Payne honorable repara|tion by a&s;king his <HI>pardon</HI> on the morrow! No &s;ooner had he made this noble re&s;olution, than, recovering that delicious gaiety, which ever accompanies good purpo&s;es in a virtuous mind, he went to a ball in town that night and behaved as plea&s;antly as though nothing had happened: Glorious proof that great &s;ouls, like great &s;hips, are not affected by tho&s;e little puffs which would over&s;et feeble minds with pa&s;&s;ion, or &s;ink them with &s;pleen!</P>
<P>The next day he went to a tavern, and wrote a polite note to Mr. Payne, whom he reque&s;ted to meet him. Mr. Payne took it for a challenge, and repaired to the tavern, not without ex|pecting to &s;ee a pair of pi&s;tols produced. But what was his &s;ur|pri&s;e on entering the chamber to &s;ee a decanter of wine and gla&s;|&s;es on the table!

to the ball, and acting the lively agreeable friend, as if nothing had happened, he would, like an angry viper that had been trod on, have retired to his chamber. There he would have found no &s;uch entertainments as WASHINGTON had at the ball; no &s;prightly mu&s;ic&mdash;no delicious wines&mdash;no &s;weetly-&s;miling friends: on the contrary, all the tortures of a &s;oul brooding over its indignities, until reflection had whipped it up into pangs of rage unutterable, while all the demons of hell with blood-&s;tained torches pointing at his bleeding honor, cried out revenge! re|venge! revenge! There in his chamber he would have pa&s;&s;ed the gloomy night, in preparing his pi&s;tols, moulding his balls, or with furious looks, and hard-gritted teeth, driving his bullets through the body of his enemy chalked out on the wall. The next morning would have &s;een him on the field, and, in language, lately heard in this &s;tate, calling out to his hated antagoni&s;t, <HI>you have injured me, sir, beyond reconciliation, and by G&mdash;d I will put you to death, if I can.</HI> While his antagoni&s;t in a &s;tyle equally mu&s;ical and chri&s;tian, rejoins, <HI>kill and be damned!</HI> Pop go the pi&s;tols, down tumbles one of the combatants; while the mur|derer with knocking knees and looks of Cain flies from the a|venger of blood.

<P>Thus bloody and mi&s;erable might have been the end of WASH|INGTON or of Mr. Payne, had WASHINGTON been one of tho&s;e poor deluded young men, who are determined to be great, and to be talked of in news papers, in &s;pite of God or devil. But, WASHINGTON was not born to exemplify tho&s;e horrid trage|dies, which <HI>cowards</HI> create in &s;ociety by pu&s;illanimou&s;ly giving way to their bad pa&s;&s;ions. No! he was born to teach his coun|trymen, what &s;weet peace and harmony might for ever &s;mile in the habitations of men, if all had but the <HI>courage,</HI> like him|&s;elf, to obey the &s;acred voice of JUSTICE and of HUMANITY. By firmly obeying the&s;e, he pre&s;erved his hands un&s;tained by the blood of a fellow man; and his &s;oul unharrowed by the cruel tooth of never-dying remor&s;e. By firmly obeying the&s;e, he won tho&s;e &s;miles of God which convey to the &s;ouls of the virtuous, that joy which the &s;tranger meddleth not with. By firmly obeying the&s;e, he pre&s;erved a life, which crowned with deeds of Ju&s;tice and benevolence, has brought more glory to

God, more good to man, and more honor to him&s;elf, than any life ever lived &s;ince the race of man began.</P>
<P>Sons of Columbia! would you know what is true courage? &s;ee it defined, &s;ee it exemplified in this act of your great, young countryman. Never man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a more undaunted courage than WASHINGTON: but in him, this noble quality was the life-guard of his rea&s;on, not the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in; a ready &s;ervant to <HI>obey</HI> her high commands, not a bully to in&s;ult them; a champion to defend his neighbour's rights, not a tyrant to trample them un|der foot. Tran&s;ported by a &s;udden pa&s;&s;ion, to which all are lia|ble, he offended Mr. Payne who re&s;ented it much too roughly, by knocking him down on the &s;pot. WASHINGTON had it in his power to have taken ample revenge; and cowards, who have no command over their pa&s;&s;ions, would have done it; but duty for|bade him, and he had the <HI>courage</HI> to obey&punc; Rea&s;on whi&s;pered the folly of harbouring black pa&s;&s;ions in his &s;oul, poi&s;oning his peace; he in&s;tantly bani&s;hed them and went to a ball, to drink &s;weet &s;treams of friend&s;hip from the eyes of happy friends. A|gain, rea&s;on whi&s;pered him that having been the aggre&s;&s;or, he ought to a&s;k Mr. Payne's pardon, and make friends with him. In this al&s;o he had the courage to obey her &s;acred voice.</P>
<P>In what hi&s;tory ancient or modern, &s;acred or profane, can you find in &s;o young a man, only 22, &s;uch an in&s;tance of that TRUE HEROIC VAL<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">R which combats malignant pa&s;&s;ions, conquers un|rea&s;onable <HI>self,</HI> rejects the hell of <HI>hatred,</HI> and invites the heaven of <HI>love</HI> into our own bo&s;oms, and into tho&s;e of our brethren with whom we may have had a falling out; Jo&s;eph forgiving his breth|ren in the land of Egypt; David &s;paring that inveterate &s;eeker of his life, Saul; Sir Walter Rawleigh pardoning the young man who &s;pat in his face; afford, it is true, charming &s;pecimens of the &s;ublime and beautiful in action, and certainly &s;uch men are the worthies of the world and brighte&s;t ornaments of human nature. But yet none of them have gone beyond WASHING|TON in the affair of Payne.</P>
<P>A few years after this, Payne had a cau&s;e tried in Fairfax Court, and WASHINGTON happened on that day to be in the hou&s;e. The lawyer on the other &s;ide, finding he was going fa&s;t to leeward, thought he would luff up with a whole broad&s;ide at Payne's character; and after raking him fore and aft with abu&s;e, he artfully bore away under the lee of the jury's prejudices which he endeavored to inflame again&s;t him.

Yes, this is the wretch who dared in this very Court-Hou&s;e-yard, to lift up his impious hand again&s;t that greate&s;t and be&s;t of men, and knocked him down as though he had been but a bullock of the Stalls."</P>
<P>This roared out in a thundering tone, and with a tremendous &s;tamp on the floor, made Payne look very wild, for he &s;aw the countenances of the court beginning to blacken on him. But WASHINGTON aro&s;e immediately and addre&s;&s;ed the Bench&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>As to Mr. Payne's character, may it plea&s;e your wor&s;hips, &s;aid he, we all have the &s;atisfaction to know that it is perfect|ly unexceptionable; and with re&s;pect to the little difference which formerly happened between that gentleman and my&s;elf, it was in&s;tantly made up, and we have lived on the be&s;t terms ever &s;ince: and be&s;ides, I could wi&s;h all my acquaintance to know, that I entirely acquit Mr. Payne of blame in that affair, and take it all on my&s;elf as the aggre&s;&s;or.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Payne u&s;ed often to relate another anecdote of WASH|INGTON, which reflects equal honor on the goodne&s;s of his heart.</P>
<P>"Immediately after the war, &s;aid he, when the conquering hero was returned in peace to his home, with the laurels of victo|ry green and flouri&s;hing on his head; I felt a great de&s;ire to &s;ee him, and &s;o &s;et out for Mount Vernon. As I drew near the hou&s;e, I began to experience a ri&s;ing fear le&s;t he &s;hould call to mind the blow I had given him in former days. However, ani|mating my&s;elf, I pu&s;hed on. WASHINGTON met me at the door with a &s;miling welcome, and pre&s;ently led me into an adjoining room where Mrs. WASHINGTON &s;at. <Q>Here, my dear, &s;aid he, pre&s;enting me to his lady, here is the little man you have &s;o often heard me talk of, and who, on a difference between us one day, had the re&s;olution to knock me down, big as I am. I know you will honor him as he de&s;erves, for I a&s;&s;ure you he has the heart of a true Virginian.</Q>&mdash;He &s;aid this&punc; continued Mr. Payne, with an air which convinced me that his long familiarity with war, had not robbed him of a &s;ingle &s;park of the goodne&s;s and noblene&s;s of his heart. And Mrs. WASHINGTON looked at him. I thought, with a &s;omething in her eyes which &s;hewed that he appeared to her greater and lovelier than ever.</P>

<P>In con&s;equence of his wealth and large landed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, he had vi&s;its innumerable from the poor. Knowing the great va|lue of time and of good tempers to them, he could not bear that
<PB N="54" REF="039062_0057_10138F6E569EF078">
they &s;hould lo&s;e the&s;e by long waiting, and &s;huffling, and blow|ing their fingers at his door. He had a room &s;et apart for the reception of &s;uch poor per&s;ons as had bu&s;ine&s;s with him, and the porter had orders to conduct them into it, and to let him know it immediately; and &s;o affectionately attentive was he to them, that, if he was in company with the greate&s;t characters on the continent when his &s;ervant informed him that a poor man wi&s;hed to &s;peak to him, he would in&s;tantly beg them to excu&s;e him for a moment, and go and wait on him.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON'S conduct &s;hewed that he di&s;liked another prac|tice too common among &s;ome great men, who, not having the pow|er to &s;ay yes, nor the heart to &s;ay no, to a poor man, are fain to put him off with a <HI>"come again, come again,"</HI> and thus trot him backwards and forwards, wa&s;ting his time, wearing out his patience and his &s;hoes, and after all give him the mortification of a di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON could not away with &s;uch CRUEL KINDNESS. If he could not oblige a poor applicant he would candidly tell him &s;o at once; but then the goodne&s;s of his heart painted his regret &s;o &s;en&s;ibly on his countenance, that even his refu&s;als made him friends.</P>
<P>A poor Iri&s;hman wanting a little farm, and hearing that WASH|INGTON had &s;uch an one to rent, waited on him. WASHING|TON told him that he was &s;incerely &s;orry that he could not a&s;&s;i&s;t him for he had ju&s;t di&s;po&s;ed of it. The poor man took his leave, but not without returning him a thou&s;and thanks! <HI>Ah! do you thank me so heartily for a refusal?</HI> "Yes&punc; upon my &s;houl, now plea&s;e your Excellency's honor, and I do thank you a thou&s;and times. For many a great man would have kept me waiting like a black Negro; but your Excellency's honor has told me &s;trait off hand that you are &s;orry, and God ble&s;s you for it, that you can't help me&punc; and &s;o your honor has done my bu&s;ine&s;s for me in no time and le&s;s.</P>
<P>The Potomac abounds with the fine&s;t Herrings in the world, which, when &s;alted, furni&s;h not only to the wealthy a charming reli&s;h for their tea and coffee, but al&s;o to the poor a delicious &s;ub|&s;titute for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. But fond as they are of this <HI>small boned Bacon,</HI> as they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> call it, many of them have not the means to pro|cure it. WASHINGTON'S heart felt for the&s;e poor people and provided a remedy. He ordered a &s;eine and a batteau to be kept on one of his be&s;t fi&s;hing &s;hores on purpo&s;e for the poor. If the batteau was lo&s;t or the &s;eine &s;poilt, which was often the ca&s;e, he would have them replaced with new ones immediately. And if the poor who came for fi&s;h, were at any time too weak-handed to haul the &s;eine them&s;elves, they needed but to apply to the over&s;eer, who had orders from WASHINGTON, to &s;end hands to help them.
<PB N="55" REF="039062_0058_10138F719DE41598">
Thus, all the poor of his large neighbourhood had it in their power to come down in the &s;ea&s;on, and catch an abundance of the fine&s;t fi&s;h for them&s;elves and their families. In what &s;ilver floods were ever yet caught the herrings, which could have given to WASH|INGTON what he ta&s;ted, on &s;eeing the poor, driving away from his &s;hores with carts laden with delicious fi&s;h, and carrying home, whooping and &s;inging, to their &s;miling wives and children, the rich prize, a whole year's joy and plenty!</P>
<P>In all his charities, he di&s;covered great judgment and care in &s;electing proper objects. Character was the <HI>main chance.</HI> Mount Vernon had no charms for lazy, drunken, worthle&s;s beggars. Such knew very well that they mu&s;t carry their pigs (their vices) to another market. He never failed to remind them of the great crime of robbing the public of their &s;ervices, and al&s;o the exceed|ing cruelty and inju&s;tice of &s;napping up from the really indigent, what little charity bread there was &s;tirring. But if the character was good; if the poor petitioner was a &s;ober, hone&s;t and indu&s;tri|ous per&s;on whom Providence had by &s;ickne&s;s or lo&s;&s;es, reduced to want, he found a brother in WASHINGTON. It is incredible what quantities of wool, corn, bacon, flour, clothes, &amp;c. &amp;c. were annually di&s;tributed to the poor from that almo&s;t exhau&s;tle&s;s heap, which the ble&s;&s;ings of heaven had heaped on this its &s;o <HI>industrious</HI> and <HI>faithful</HI> &s;teward.</P>
<P>"I had orders, &s;aid Mr. Peake, a &s;en&s;ible, hone&s;t manager of one of WASHINGTON'S plantations, to fill a corn hou&s;e every year for the &s;ole u&s;e of the poor in my neighbourhood, to whom it was a mo&s;t &s;ea&s;onable and precious relief; &s;aving numbers of poor women and children from mi&s;erable famine, and ble&s;&s;ing them with a chearful plenteou&s;ne&s;s of bread."</P>
<P>Mr. Lund Wa&s;hington, long a manager of his mount Vernon e&s;tate, had &s;imilar orders. In one year when corn was &s;o dear (a dollar per bu&s;hel) that numbers of the poor were on the point of &s;tarving, Mr. L. Wa&s;hington, by order of the General, not on|ly gave away all that could be &s;pared from the granaries, but bought at that dear rate <HI>several hundred bushels&punc;</HI> for them!</P>
<P>But it were an endle&s;s ta&s;k to enumerate all the thou&s;and, thou|&s;and &s;weet and &s;ea&s;onable charities of this good angel of the poor. The wondering &s;tranger beheld them in the &s;hining eyes and de|vouring looks of ALL, wherever he went.</P>
<P>When the young men &s;aw him they flocked to the door, and the aged aro&s;e and &s;tood up.</P>
<P>The great men refrained from talking in his pre&s;ence, and the hearts of the LITTLE ONES leaped for joy.</P>
<P>Becau&s;e he fed the poor that cried unto him, and his garment covered the naked.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="039062_0059_10138F75822E51B0">
He was a father of the fatherle&s;s, and &s;tood up mightily for him that had none to help him.</P>
<P>The ble&s;&s;ing of him that was ready to peri&s;h came upon him, and he cau&s;ed the heart of the widow to &s;ing for joy.</P>
<P>Ble&s;&s;ed be thy &s;oul, O WASHINGTON, child of generous love! Thou wa&s;t as the black &s;torm of winter to the foes of thy country; but to the children of the poor, like the &s;oft cloud of &s;ummer that droppeth down marrow and fatne&s;s! Thou ha&s;t cea&s;ed among men, and the tears of millions have flowed; but thou art with HIM who is MIGHTY to REWARD. For the bread which thou gave&s;t to thy poor brethren, thou art now fed with pure&s;t manna, and ho|ney from the rocks of heaven, even Angels food. And for the cloth with which thou did&s;t cover their nakedne&s;s, thy covering now is from the looms of Paradi&s;e, even robes of floating gold. Bright &s;un beam of glory, thou ha&s;t cea&s;ed among men, but thy &s;hining is with him who is mighty to reward!</P>
<P>But though &s;o kind to the bodies, WASHINGTON was &s;till more kind and co&s;tly in his charities to the minds of the poor. Sen&s;ible that a republican government, that is, a government of the people, can never long &s;ub&s;i&s;t where the minds of the people are not en|lightened; he earne&s;tly recommended it to the citizens of the United States, to promote, as an object of <HI>primary importance,</HI> in|&s;titutions for the general diffu&s;ion of knowledge. In this, as in|deed in all other ca&s;es&punc; where any thing great or good was to be done, WASHINGTON led the way.</P>
<P>He e&s;tabli&s;hed a Charity-School in Alexandria, and endowed it with a donation of <HI>four thousand dollars!</HI> The intere&s;t was regu|larly paid and expended on the education of fifteen boys. In 1785, the A&s;&s;embly of his native &s;tate, Virginia, de&s;irous&mdash;"to embrace, as they &s;aid, every &s;uitable occa&s;ion of te&s;tifying their &s;en&s;e of the unexampled merits of GEORGE WASHINGTON, <ABBR>ESQ.</ABBR> towards his country, pre&s;ented him with fifty &s;hares in the Potomak, and one hundred &s;hares in the James River Navigation Company; making in the whole, not le&s;s than the enormous &s;um of fifteen thou&s;and pounds &s;terling!</P>
<P>Of this public act, they reque&s;ted the Governor to tran&s;mit WASHINGTON a copy. In an&s;wer to which he addre&s;&s;ed a very elegant letter to the Governor, "in which I take the liberty" &s;ays he, <Q>of returning to the General A&s;&s;embly, through your hands, the profound and grateful acknowledgments, in&s;pired by &s;o &s;ig|nal a mark of their beneficent intentions towards me.</Q></P>
<P>He goes on to beg that they would be &s;o good as to excu&s;e his determined re&s;olution not to accept a farthing of it for his <HI>own use.</HI> "But," continued he, <Q>if it &s;hould plea&s;e the General A&s;&s;embly to permit me to turn the de&s;tination of the fund ve&s;ted

<P>They were very chearfully &s;ubmitted to his di&s;po&s;al; and, ac|cording to promi&s;e, he appropriated them to works of the greate&s;t public utility; <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> His &s;hares in the James River Canal, to a College in Rock-bridge County, near the waters of James River, and his Potomak Shares to a National Univer&s;ity to be erected in the Federal di&s;trict, on the Great Potomak.</P>
<P>How immortal were his wi&s;hes for the good of his country! As if incapable of being &s;atisfied with all that he had done for her while living, he endeavoured be founding the&s;e noble in&s;titutions for the diffu&s;ion of knowledge and virtue, to make him&s;elf her be|nefactor when he could live no more. Charming evidence, that, like Cato, he ta&s;ted no happine&s;s equal to that of making others happy.</P>

<P>But of all the virtues that &s;hed &s;uch dignity and grace on the character of WASHINGTON, there was none &s;o venerable and ma|je&s;tic as his Ju&s;tice, or Hone&s;ty. This from his youth, he &s;eems to have revered, as the precious pillar that &s;upports the fair fabric of all &s;ocial order and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>The Marquis de Cha&s;tell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ux ob&s;erves, that WASHINGTON'S reputation for incorruptible ju&s;tice, &s;tood &s;o high, even while a young man, that all the neighbouring gentlemen, if they could but get him as an executor to their wills, clo&s;ed their eyes in peace; from a &s;weetly &s;atisfying &s;en&s;e, that ju&s;tice would be done to the fa|milies they left behind them, to his care.</P>
<P>Being a&s;ked which he thought the greate&s;t man, Ari&s;tides the ju&s;t, or, Cae&s;ar the generous; <HI>Oh! Aristides, a thousand times!</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="039062_0061_10138F79FAAA6308">
replied he, with eyes &s;parkling with admiration and love of that great man, <Q>Had every body been as ju&s;t as Ari&s;tides, there would have been no Cae&s;ar. The one was more than a man, the other wor&s;e than a bea&s;t of prey.</Q> With &s;uch exalted &s;en|timents of ju&s;tice, no wonder that the firm-toned WASHINGTON &s;tood through life &s;o immoveably by her &s;acred &s;tandard: So im|moveably, we tru&s;t, will our Captains of men of war &s;tand by the <HI>Four and twenty Pounders</HI> of their country, with duty and her &s;ixteen &s;tripes waving over their heads.</P>
<P>The great Turenne is de&s;ervedly celebrated by his countrymen the French, for his delicate &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice. The magi&s;trates of a large di&s;trict, dreading the march of his numerous army through their fields, vineyards, &amp;c. waited on him and offered a bag of <HI>one hundred thousand crowns,</HI> if he would take another route. He refu&s;ed their money. Seeing them greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed he ha&s;|tened to relieve them. "Gentlemen, &s;aid he, I did not <HI>intend</HI> to march through your country; ju&s;tice therefore will not allow me to pocket your money for not doing what I really did not in|tend to do." Glorious Turenne! Equally Glorious WASHINGTON! For when offered by his native &s;tate the enormous &s;um of &s;eventy thou&s;and Dollars! he refu&s;ed it all, becau&s;e he had formerly made &s;omething like a promi&s;e that he would never take pay for any &s;ervices done to his mother country.

And yet for complai&s;ance &s;ake, or to amu&s;e his friends on a winter's evening, he had no objection to a hand at whi&s;t: but he always played for plea&s;ure, not for pence; to divert his friends, not to &s;trip them.&mdash;So that all the choice dinners and &s;uppers which his friends got at his table, (and no ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n America, perhaps <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">one in the world gave &s;o many) were all clear gain to them. WASHINGTON would have died a thou&s;and deaths, rather than have allowed the &s;lighte&s;t ground for &s;uch vile dirt to be thrown on him, as Quin the Play|er daubed on a <HI>Nobleman</HI> with whom he had &s;upped.

<P>It was this delicate &s;en&s;e of honor that &s;et WASHINGTON &s;o point blank again&s;t making purcha&s;es, when he had not a dead certainly of paying at the time due.

<P>It was a frequent &s;aying with WASHINGTON, that, "to dive deep into a merchant's Ledger, was a &s;ure &s;ign of a failing fortune, or a callous con&s;cience." For this rea&s;on his life was a Practical comment on that whole&s;ome old proverb, <HI>Cut your Coat according to your cloth."</HI> Hence, like the famous Pilot boats of his native &s;tate, he always &s;ailed nearer the wind, than did his income, be that as &s;canty as it would. I have been told by his old friend and pa&s;tor, the Rev. Mr. Lee Ma&s;&s;ey, who, (if wit and worth could have given bi&s;hoprics, would have had a mitre long ago,) that while WASHINGTON received no more than the &s;alary of a Coun|ty &s;urveyor, he always had a dollar at the &s;ervice of a friend: and never &s;uffered a creditor to tip him the wink and take him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|&s;ide to &s;hove an account into his fi&s;t. And when by the genero&s;ity of his brother, he inherited the Mount Vernon e&s;tate, and by the far greater genero&s;ity of the young Mrs. Martha Cu&s;tis, he was made one of the wealthie&s;t men in America, he continued the &s;ame, independent and good. He walked with <HI>justice,</HI> and ju&s;tice is one of the mighty pillars that &s;upport the throne of him who is the &s;ame ye&s;terday, to day and for ever.</P>
<P>WASHINGTON u&s;ed often to &s;ay, that, <Q><HI>to be just,</HI> a man mu&s;t &s;ometimes cea&s;e to be generous. Generous minds have been known, e&s;pecially when young, to gratify their benevolence e|ven at the expence of their hone&s;ty. The rea&s;on is, acts of Genero&s;ity give great plea&s;ure to our&s;elves; they attract on us the admiration and love of others; and every &s;ermon we hear, every novel we read, dwells on the prai&s;es of charity.

<P>From the &s;ame profound veneration for ju&s;tice, Wa&s;hington was always eminent for the punctality of his promi&s;es and payments.

Wa&s;hington pa&s;&s;ed through life without any of the&s;e cur&s;es; for in all his dealings, every thing was &s;o clearly under|&s;tood, &s;o fairly expre&s;&s;ed, that there was no room for heart-burn|ings.

Charmed with that hea|ven which re&s;ults from good government, and a prompt obedience to it, he readily returned the glittering &s;word of the victorious Generali&s;&s;imo,&mdash;&s;tepped down from the exalted chair of &s;upreme magi&s;tracy&mdash;mixed as a commoner among the citizens&mdash;obeyed tho&s;e whom he had been accu&s;tomed to command&mdash;honored the pre&s;ident&mdash;revered the laws&mdash;paid his taxes, and, in every re|&s;pect, behaved as became the man, who was fully po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this great idea, that, in exact proportion to our <HI>union,</HI> will be our &s;trength, our peace and pro&s;perity at home, and our re&s;pectability and &s;ucce&s;s abroad.</P>

form, mo&s;t of the nations of the world, groan under the caprice and cruelty of the kingly governments. That a people may be happy under the admini&s;tration of a <HI>wi&s;e and good</HI> king, we all agree, becau&s;e, thank God, there have been charming in&s;tances of it; but then alas! wi&s;e and good kings are very rare, almo&s;t as rare as Wa&s;hingtons. The pride and ambition common to man, nur&s;ed in the hot-bed of a court, and high fed on luxury and flattery, too generally run up into the vile&s;t mon&s;ters, at once the di&s;grace and cur&s;e of human kind.</P>
<P>"When I look around me (&s;ays the Rev. Dr. Chandler, one of the ornaments both of Engli&s;h learning and piety) on the pre|&s;ent <HI>kings of Europe,</HI> I am apt to a&s;k my&s;elf, what is there in mo&s;t of them that &s;hould make their &s;ubjects wi&s;h their lives, or regret their deaths? Actuated by ambition or revenge, or &s;unk in indolence and plea&s;ure, they wa&s;te the riches of their people by the mo&s;t abominable extravagance and di&s;&s;ipation; or ru&s;h their &s;ubjects into war, to the certain murder and ruin of thou|&s;ands of them. And as to our <HI>own kings,</HI> &s;ome of them invol|ved us in all the calamities of civil wars; others impoveri&s;hed and oppre&s;&s;ed us by illegal exactions; and the generality of them, either by their own choice, or led by wicked mini&s;ters, &s;acrificed the national intere&s;t to their own accur&s;ed ambition, revenge, and debauchery."</P>
<P>And when the ancient Jews, in evil hour, applied to God for a king, he told them they did not know what they were a&s;king for. "This," &s;aid he, by his prophet Samuel, "will be the character, (meaning the <HI>general</HI> character) of the king that &s;hall reign over you: he will take your &s;ons and appoint them for him|&s;elf for his chariots, and to be his hor&s;emen, and &s;ome &s;hall run before his chariots. And he will appoint them captains over thou&s;ands, and captains over fifties; and will &s;et them to ear his ground, and to reap his harve&s;t, and to make his in&s;truments of war, and in&s;truments of his chariots. And he will take your daughters to make his pa&s;try, and to be cooks and bakers, And he will take your fields, and your vine-yards, and your olive-yards; even the be&s;t of them and give them to his &s;ervants and his officers. And he will take your men &s;ervants and your maid &s;ervants; and your goodlie&s;t young men, and your a&s;&s;es and put them all to his work: and ye &s;hall be his &s;ervants. And ye &s;hall cry out in that day becau&s;e of your king which ye &s;hall have cho&s;en unto you; and the Lord will not hear you in that day."</P>

<P>Ca&s;t your eyes over ancient Rome, while virtuous and united, the mighty Mi&s;tre&s;s of the world! but no &s;ooner had the evil &s;pi|rit of party and faction crept in among them, than the old Roman &s;teel became as a rope of &s;and falling into pieces of it&s;elf.

the Latin words that &s;tood for &s;cape-gallows, and damned &s;coun|drel, and &s;o on. Such fuel as this &s;oon blew up the flame to a pitch beyond re&s;traint. Merius fir&s;t opened the horrid &s;cene and glutted, his followers with the blood and wealth of the friends of Sylla; Sylla repaid the Marian faction in the &s;ame coin, and with intere&s;t. In the&s;e unnatural conte&s;ts thou&s;ands of Roman citizens were but|chered; their wives and children barbarou&s;ly turned out of doors, and their e&s;tates confi&s;cated and &s;old to cram the pur&s;es and to fatten the vices of their diabolical de&s;troyers. Bloody battles were often fought in the very &s;treets: and wretched Rome more than once experienced from her own citizens all the horrors of a city taken by &s;torm.</P>
<P>And in the hi&s;tories of the civil wars of Great-Britain, and, here lately of France, we may behold the &s;ame horrid features of faction. Here are the two parties, Whigs and Tories, or Ari&s;|tocrats and Democrats. A little time ago, while they had a government, though a very imperfect one, they loved each other as children of the &s;ame country and con&s;titution, and would in a moment have fought for one another with all the heroi&s;m of mag|nanimous brothers: But now, &s;plit into parties and driving at different intere&s;ts, they regard each other as <HI>enemies.</HI> Jealou&s;y and hatred, true mi&s;cro&s;copes of hell, are before their eyes and conceal from <HI>each</HI> all the good <HI>qualities</HI> and <HI>intentions</HI> of the <HI>other;</HI> and at the &s;ame time, &s;o <HI>di&s;tort, magnify</HI> and <HI>blacken</HI> all their de&s;igns and actions, that they appear to each other as little better than Devils. Their News-Papers too, as if warm and &s;moaking from the pre&s;&s;es of the damned, lend all their fire and brim&s;tone to feed the infernal flame. <HI>"The Ari&s;tocrats!</HI> (cries the pa&s;&s;ion-choaked Printer on the other &s;ide). <HI>The Aris|tocrats! A &s;et of unfeeling Kingly Villains! Mon&s;ters of Pride, who would as lieve drive their guilt Chariots over a poor Man, as over a dog: and would devour widows hou&s;es for a &s;take at an E. O. Table! Vile mi&s;creants, who only want a Kingly Government that they may fleece and lord it over the poor!"</HI></P>
<P>On the other hand, the Ari&s;tocrat Gazettes give chapter and ver&s;e for it, that <HI>"The Democrats are a lazy vicious race, who&s;e poverty and lice make them envy and hate the rich; and who will never be at re&s;t, until, having trampled down Religion, &punc;Laws, and Government, they are at full liberty, like wild Arabs, to rob and plunder their wealthier neighbours."</HI></P>
<P>Grounded now on &s;omething like love of public good, the bad pa&s;&s;ions of the two parties rage with redoubled fury. They &s;el|dom meet in company without fierce contentions and bloody frays.

faces and glaring eyes. The horrid tragedy ripens fa&s;t, and the dreadful &s;torm is on the very eve of bur&s;ting. Numerous Ravens, with ill brooding croaks and terrifying &s;creams, are &s;een flapping their wings flow and &s;ad, over the fated city. All night long fearful noi&s;es are head in the air, as of groans from dying per|&s;ons; while frightful meteors, in &s;hape of fiery balls, &s;hoot through the gloom leaving long hideous tracks behind them like &s;treams of blood. In the morning, the awful roar of guns is heard in the mid&s;t of the city. Trembling &s;eizes on the aged, while the feeble &s;ex &s;icken with terrors unfelt before. The men &s;natch up arms, and ru&s;h, in tumultuous crowds, to the place whence the noi&s;e proceeds. Immen&s;e is the concour&s;e. The orators on both &s;ides get up to addre&s;s the eager throngs, and with bittere&s;t abu&s;e inflame their pa&s;&s;ions again&s;t each other to madne&s;s. The fierce uproaring crowds can withhold no longer. With horrid impreca|tions, with faces black with rage, and eye balls fla&s;hing fire, they fly at each other like tygers. They plunge their knives, &s;words and daggers into each others hearts. Pale and &s;taggering, with mutual cur&s;es in death, they &s;ink to the ground. The &s;treets are floated with blood. The dead bodies lie heaps on heaps, while women and children, with wringing hands, and heart-piercing cries, demand their hu&s;bands, their fathers, and their brothers.</P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>O accur&s;ed Faction and Party!</HI> The&s;e are your bloody fruits! Thus it is. that by filling our &s;ouls with the pa&s;&s;ions of the damned, you turn man into a devil to man, you turn the faire&s;t cities into &s;laughter-hou&s;es, you turn earth it&s;elf, the goodly creation of God, into the hell from whence you came!</P>

<P>In the foregoing pages we have &s;een a &s;ketch of the life of Wa&s;hington; of <HI>him,</HI> who was the pride of America, and boa&s;t of humankind; who united in him&s;elf &s;uch a Con&s;tellation of vir|tues as <HI>&s;weetly</HI> a&s;&s;ure us of <HI>Immortality,</HI>&mdash;of our relation to ANGELS&mdash;and of our capacities for glories and felicities, that &s;hall know no bounds.</P>
<P>It is hardly exaggeration to &s;ay that WASHINGTON was pious as Numa; ju&s;t as Ari&s;tides; temperate as Epictetus; patriotic as Regulus; in giving public tru&s;ts, impartial as Severus; in vic|tory, mode&s;t as Scipio; prudent as Fabius; rapid as Marcellus; undaunted as Hannibal; as Cincinnatus di&s;intere&s;ted; to liberty firm as Cato; and re&s;pectful of the laws as Socrates. Or, to &s;peak in plainer terms; he was religious without &s;uper&s;tition; ju&s;t without rigour; charitable without profu&s;ion; ho&s;pitable without making others pay for it; generous but with his own money; rich without covetou&s;ne&s;s; frugal without meanne&s;s; humane without weakne&s;s; brave without ra&s;hne&s;s; &s;ucce&s;sful without vanity; victorious without pride; a lover of his country, but no hater of French or Engli&s;h; a &s;taunch friend of govern|ment but re&s;pectful of tho&s;e who pointed out its defects with de|cency; true to his word without eva&s;ion of perfidy; firm in adver|&s;ity; moderate in pro&s;perity; glorious and honoured in life; peaceful and happy in death.</P>
<P>Thus &s;ingularly virtuous was the man, whom Heaven was plea&s;ed to &s;elect as his honored in&s;trument to e&s;tabli&s;h this great WESTERN REPUBLIC. And if every thing be duly con&s;idered, I tru&s;t it will appear WASHINGTON was rai&s;ed up of God as a forerunner to &s;ome mighty event.

The greate&s;t of all human beings was now lying low; a life of all others the mo&s;t revered, the mo&s;t beloved was at &s;take. Craik, Dick and Brown, the able&s;t GUARDS of life, were &s;tationed around him bending o|ver the pro&s;trate hero. If human &s;kill and &s;olicitude could have availed; if the &s;word of genius and the buckler of experience could have repelled the blows of death, WASHINGTON had &s;till lived. Defeated a thou&s;and times by their &s;uperior &s;kill, when lives le&s;s valuable were contended for, Death began to fear left this great prize &s;o long coveted &s;hould be &s;natched from him.&mdash;But he &s;oon felt his arm invigorated by a &s;trength <HI>not his own.</HI>&mdash;The great hour was <HI>come</HI> and WASHINGTON mu&s;t die. Yes his Man&s;ion is prepared above. The crown of his rejoicing is bright. The harps of the ble&s;&s;ed are &s;trung. "Let the angel of Death conduct the Soul of WASHINGTON to the fea&s;ts of Heaven."</P>
<P>It appears, that, from the commencement of the attack, he was favoured with a pre&s;entiment, that, he was now laid down to ri&s;e no more. He took however the medicines that were of|fered him, but it was principally to oblige the long-loved partner of his heart and bed.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid that a man's death is a true copy of his life. This is generally the ca&s;e with tho&s;e who die in their &s;en&s;es. It was WASHINGTON'S ca&s;e exactly. In his la&s;t illne&s;s he behaved with the undaunted firmne&s;s of a &s;oldier, and the calm re&s;igna|tion of a chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>The inflammation in his throat was attended with great pain, which he bore with the fortitude that became him. He was once or twice heard to &s;ay that had it plea&s;ed God he &s;hould have been glad to die a little ea&s;ier; but that he doubted not that it was for his good.</P>
<P>Every hour now &s;pread a fader gloom over the &s;cene. De|&s;pair &s;at on the faces of the phy&s;icians; for they &s;aw that their art had failed. The &s;trength of the mighty was departing from him; and Death, with his &s;ad harbingers, chills, and palene&s;s, was coming on apace.</P>

Mount Vernon, which had long &s;hone above all families, the Queen of elegant joys, was now about to &s;uffer a &s;ad Eclip&s;e! an Eclip&s;e which would &s;oon be mournfully vi&s;ible, not only through the United States but throughout the world.</P>
<P>An awful &s;ilence prevails throughout the &s;pacious Dwelling.&mdash;The big grief has &s;ealed every lip and darkened every countenance. His &s;ervants are now about to lo&s;e their long loved ma&s;ter and protector; and his friends to bid a la&s;t adieu to the endearing &s;o|ciety of the greate&s;t and be&s;t of human kind. Their faces are &s;wollen with weeping, and torrents of bitter tears roll down their cheeks. But though bitter, yet &s;hallow are their &s;treams of &s;or|row, when compared with that flood of unutterable woe, which o|verwhelms the &s;oul of his life's dear companion. Ble&s;&s;'d with a &s;oul, capable of loving an angle &s;pirit inhabiting the noble&s;t form, &s;he had given her heart and hand to her WASHINGTON in early life. Forty happy years had they lived together like two <HI>lovers</HI> joined in wedlock. Every year, &s;weet as it rolled along, marked their ever growing loves&mdash;Loves, which, fed by mutual tender|ne&s;s and virtue, were continually a&s;cending with a brighter flame, nearer and nearer to their native &s;kies&mdash;Loves, which by a forty years inter-growth, were become &s;o incorporated, as to render each <HI>a part of the others &s;elf.</HI> O! how heart breaking!&mdash;How &s;oul rending the &s;eparation! But the hour of &s;eparation is come! She can keep her WASHINGTON no longer! He, who&s;e compa|ny was the perpetual fea&s;t of her &s;oul, mu&s;t now be taken from her! That voice which was &s;weeter to her ear than the mu&s;ic of &s;ongs, &s;hall charm her ear no more. She &s;hall &s;peak to him but he will not an&s;wer. The echo of her voice will frighten her own &s;oul. That face which was welcomer to her eyes than the &s;treaks of the morning, &s;hall rejoice her eyes no more. She &s;hall awake in the morning; but &s;hall not &s;ee him&mdash;She &s;hall &s;eek him early; but &s;hall not find him. The place where her beloved lay, will be empty. The heavine&s;s of her heart returns; her tears of grief roll down.</P>
<P>Great, honoured Lady! what but the arm of the mighty God of Wa&s;hington, could have &s;upported thee in that di&s;mal hour of darkne&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s! And he did &s;upport thee. The con&s;o|lations of religion were thine; and her con&s;olations are mighty. Oft had thy WASHINGTON reminded thee, when the tear &s;welled in thine eye, and the &s;igh of thy bo&s;om aro&s;e at the thought of par|ting; oft had he reminded thee of tho&s;e bli&s;sful &s;hores, where the &s;ouls of the virtuous, e&s;caped from the &s;orrows of mortality, &s;hall <HI>&s;oon meet again,</HI> infinitely improved; and there in the pre&s;ence of <HI>HIM WHO MADE THEM,</HI> &s;hall pluck and eat together, in communion &s;weet, the rich <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of eternal life.</P>

Sons and Daughters of Columbia! gather your&s;elves together, around the bed of your fallen hero; around the bed of him to whom (under God) you and your children are indebted for the riche&s;t ble&s;&s;ings of life. When Jo&s;eph, the great prime mini&s;ter of Egypt, heard that his <HI>Shepherd</HI>-Father was &s;ick, he ha&s;tened up to &s;ee him, and fell on his neck, and ki&s;&s;ed him and wept. Jo&s;eph had never received &s;uch &s;ervices from Jacob, as you have received from WASHINGTON. But we call you not to weep for WASHINGTON. We a&s;k you not to view tho&s;e eyes, now &s;unk and hollow, which formerly darted their lightening-fla&s;hes again&s;t your enemies; nor to feel that heart, now faintly-labouring, which formerly throbbed with more than mortal joys, when he &s;aw the young heroes of Columbia, ru&s;hing on in rattling &s;teel to charge the foe; nor to mark that arm now feeble, which &s;o of|ten waved the fiery-circled &s;word of war, pointing where the roar of battle &s;hould begin.

<P>The Great <HI>Star,</HI> lighted up of God, to lead America to freedom, is now &s;etting, but he &s;ets in glory. He looks back on pa&s;t life, as on a goodly field, which his own indu&s;try, under the divine bles|&s;ing, has &s;trewed thick with riche&s;t fruits and flowers. He looks forward with joy to tho&s;e brighter &s;cenes, which God has prepared for the &s;pirits of the ju&s;t. None ever acted better up to his great character, in <HI>life;</HI> and none ever &s;u&s;tained its la&s;t clo&s;ing &s;cenes with more dignity and grace. The &s;ummer evening &s;ky was not more &s;erene and placid than his countenance; while his rea&s;on was elevated and clear as the pure arch of heaven.</P>
<P>With what compo&s;ure did he endure the violence of his pains!

<P>Feeling that the hour of his departure out of this world was at hand; he de&s;ired that every body &s;hould quit the room. They all went out; and according to his wi&s;h, left him&mdash;with his God.</P>
<P>There, by him&s;elf, like Mo&s;es alone on the top of Pi&s;gah, he &s;eeks the face of God.

<P>He is now about to leave the great family of man, in which he has &s;o long &s;ojourned as a brother! His cheeks are bathed with tears, the yearnings of his &s;oul are over his brethren! How fer|vently does he adore that <HI>goodne&s;s,</HI> which enabled him to be &s;o &s;er|viceable to them! That <HI>grace,</HI> which pre&s;erved him from hurting them by violence or by fraud!

He &s;ees them now &s;pread abroad like flocks in goodly pa&s;tures; like favored I&s;rael in the land of promi&s;e.

The tran&s;porting &s;ight of &s;uch a cloud of ble&s;&s;ings, trembling clo&s;e over the heads of his Countrymen, together with the di&s;tre&s;s|ing uncertainty whether they will put forth their hands and enjoy them, &s;hakes the parent &s;oul of WASHINGTON with feelings too &s;trong for his dying frame.

<P>Feeling now, that, the &s;ilver cord of life is loo&s;ing, and that his &s;pirit is ready to quit her old companion the body, he extends him|&s;elf on his bed, clo&s;es his eyes, for the <HI>la&s;t</HI> time, with his own hands, folds his arms decently on his brea&s;t, then breathing out with his la&s;t parting breath. <HI>"Faller of Mercies!

<P>Here on angel wings, the brightening &s;aint a&s;cended.
