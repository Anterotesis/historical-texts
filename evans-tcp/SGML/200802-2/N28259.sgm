<BIBL>1 SAMUEL, xxv. 1.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>And Samuel died, and all the I&s;raelites were gathered to|gether, and lamented him, and buried him in his hou&s;e at Ramah.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>DAVID, by divine direction, addre&s;&s;ing him|&s;elf to the nobles and judges of the earth, denominates them <HI>gods</HI>&mdash;"I &s;aid, Ye are gods, and all of you children of the Mo&s;t High." Though he thus dignifies them with the appellation of "gods, and children of the Mo&s;t High," yet to them he adds the &s;olemn and humiliating declaration&mdash;"Ye &s;hall die like men." Though "it is ap|pointed to all men," princes and judges, as well as their &s;ubjects, "once to die," yet it is &s;uita|ble that the death of men, &s;u&s;taining different characters, &s;hould be noticed with different emotions and tokens of re&s;pect. Though our feelings often forbid us to &s;peak evil of the dead, yet we always perceive that &s;ociety &s;u&s;tains a greater lo&s;s in the death of a virtuous, de&s;irable and u&s;eful man, than in the death of one who
<PB N="4" REF="037663_0004_100F35571227C420">
was pernicious and forbidding. If we a&s;cend to the great per&s;onages who fill the mo&s;t important offices, and who&s;e conduct has great influence on the public mind, our feelings will know a differ|ence between the death of a Mo&s;es, a Jo&s;hua or a Samuel, and the death of an Ahab, an Hazael or a Jeroboam. Tho&s;e remarks &s;uppo&s;e we wi&s;ely e&s;timate the character and worth of men.</P>
<P>The death of that public character, who&s;e in|fluence has been employed in the promotion of public happine&s;s, will be lamented; while the death of him, who&s;e influence has been pe&s;tife|rous, and de&s;tructive of public tranquillity, will not excite grateful te&s;timonials of re&s;pect and &s;orrow. The&s;e remarks, it is conceived, find &s;upport as we turn the pages of in&s;piration.</P>
<P>Solomon &s;ays, "The memory of the ju&s;t is ble&s;|&s;ed; but the name of the wicked &s;hall rot." Re&s;pecting Jehoiakim, king of Judah, of whom it is &s;aid "his heart was but for covetou&s;ne&s;s, and to &s;hed innocent blood, and for oppre&s;&s;ion, and for violence&mdash;thus &s;aith the Lord concerning Jehoiakim&mdash;The people &s;hall not lament for him, &s;aying, Ah! my brother&mdash;they &s;hall not lament for him, &s;aying, Ah! Lord, or ah! his glory; but he &s;hall be buried with the burial of an a&s;s, drawn and ca&s;t forth beyond the gates of the city." Becau&s;e
<PB N="5" REF="037663_0005_100F3558A1ABE750">
of his wickedne&s;s, his death &s;hall not be noticed with tokens of re&s;pect and lamentation; as &s;aid of the wicked, "his name &s;hall rot." But "the memory of the ju&s;t is ble&s;&s;ed&mdash;the righteous &s;hall be in everla&s;ting remembrance." If, therefore, the memory of the ju&s;t and great is ble&s;&s;ed&mdash;if all I&s;rael lamented the death of Samuel, and others, becau&s;e of their &s;ingular integrity, and exten&s;ive u&s;efulne&s;s to their tribes&mdash;then &s;hall not all our intere&s;ted countrymen deeply lament the recent and &s;udden decea&s;e of the venerable and beloved man, who was the "chariot of" our American "I&s;rael, and the hor&s;emen thereof?" Shall not we, my breth|ren, as a part of this great community, mingle our tears with our bereaved fellow citizens, and join our hearts to the general voice&mdash;"Ah! Lord, and ah! his glory?" The death of one &s;o eminently u&s;eful de&s;erves to be noticed with national lamentation.</P>
<P>The important &s;ervices he has rendered his country, are a good rea&s;on why "his name &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed, and held in everla&s;ting remembrance."</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion I have cho&s;en, for the guide of our meditation, the pa&s;&s;age which informs us of the death of Samuel, and the lamentation which it ex|cited through all the tribes of I&s;rael. "Samuel died, and all the I&s;raelites were gathered together, and lamented him."</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="037663_0006_100F355B01C46098">
In pur&s;uing this &s;ubject, I &s;hall attempt to &s;how why it was proper for all I&s;rael to lament the death of Samuel; and, as we proceed, I &s;hall apply the&s;e rea&s;ons for lamentation to our&s;elves, and to the people of the United States, who are now, by the holy providence of God, bereaved of the ILLUS|TRIOUS CHIEF of our armies.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t rea&s;on we a&s;&s;ign for this general mourn|ing for Samuel is, on account of the purity of his morals, and the unblamable propriety of his conduct on all occa&s;ions. He was not only amiable in his moral character, and highly re&s;pectable on this account, but his memory was e&s;pecially dear be|cau&s;e of the happy influence of his virtuous exam|ple on the general manners of &s;ociety. Being th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> an in&s;trument of public good by his commendable example, his life was precious&mdash;his death calami|tous, and hence to be lamented by a grateful peo|ple. The&s;e rea&s;ons for lamenting the death of Samuel apply to the ca&s;e now in view. The me|mory of the great character who&s;e death is announ|ced, de&s;erves to be dear to us on account of the amiablene&s;s of his morals, and the unvarying pro|priety of his conduct in all the important &s;tations in which he has been called to act. <HI>Who</HI> has ever dared to reproach him as a man of cor|rupted morals, or indecent demeanour? <HI>Who,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="037663_0007_100F355D65CA4160">
that has been honoured as a companion in his mo&s;t <HI>&s;ocial hours,</HI> that could ever charge him with rude hilarity, with ru&s;tic and boi&s;terous mirth, and with immoral and degrading conver&s;ation? The univer&s;al te&s;timony of his mo&s;t intimate acquain|tance &s;upports the mo&s;t refined gracefulne&s;s of his manners, and the &s;ingular dignity of his appear|ance, even in the <HI>&s;ocial circle,</HI> and when lea&s;t under the <HI>critici&s;m</HI> of the public eye.</P>
<P>Though he was long familiarized to the field of war, and a daily witne&s;s of the too fa&s;hionable vi|ces of his martial brethren, yet he never degraded him&s;elf by an imitation of their follies. His uni|form example was a con&s;tant le&s;&s;on of &s;olemn re|proof. The common vices of the camp, &s;uch as intemperance and profanity, were known to be &s;o extremely ungrateful to his moral ta&s;te, that tho&s;e mo&s;t ea&s;ily be&s;et with the&s;e &s;ins felt his pre|&s;ence as a mo&s;t powerful re&s;traint. We have not only the plea&s;ure to &s;peak thus explicitly in favour of the purity and dignity of the moral character of the Man whom all the people delighted to honour, but we have farther rea&s;on to rejoice, in the belief that he ever acted upon moral principle.</P>
<P>When Commander of our armies, and when Pre&s;ident of our nation, he often publicly declared his full belief in the univer&s;al and righteous provi|dence
<PB N="8" REF="037663_0008_100F356044ABFFC8">
of God. This his belief was ever expre&s;&s;ed in terms indicative of an humble &s;en&s;e of depen|dence. His acknowledgments of favours were al&s;o expre&s;&s;ive of the temper of a grateful heart.</P>
<P>The benign influence of religion on the order and happine&s;s of &s;ociety, was a &s;ubject which en|gaged his devout contemplation, and on which he hath expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the mo&s;t plea&s;ing terms. In his Farewell Addre&s;s, which we now read with &s;olemn thoughtfulne&s;s, he ob&s;erves, that "<HI>religion</HI> and <HI>morality</HI> are indi&s;pen&s;able &s;upports to political pro&s;perity&mdash;that <HI>the&s;e</HI> are the great pillars of hu|man happine&s;s&mdash;that they have an intimate con|nexion with private and public felicity&mdash;and that if a &s;en&s;e of religious obligation de&s;ert the oaths which are the in&s;truments of inve&s;tigation in courts of ju&s;tice, there can be no &s;ecurity left for proper|ty, reputation and life." The&s;e &s;entiments har|monize with divine truth&mdash;that "godline&s;s is pro|fitable to all things;" and &s;how, that a deep &s;en&s;e of its worth had a fixed re&s;idence in his heart. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, his death calls for our &s;incere lamentation. "His memory is ble&s;|&s;ed," and his name de&s;erves to be held in our "la&s;ting remembrance." The advantages deriva|ble to &s;ociety, from his moral in&s;tructions and example, are innumerable, and ine&s;timably great.
<PB N="9" REF="037663_0009_100F3561D14FEE38">
This remark will appear ju&s;t, if we recur to the pernicious influence on &s;ociety of a bad example in men who have filled eminent &s;tations; of which the world has witne&s;&s;ed many in&s;tances, and had fatal experience.</P>
<P>Look through the hi&s;tory of the Jews, and when did a vile and immoral character pre&s;ide over the nation, and the ill effects of his example were not felt through all their tribes?</P>
<P>Immoral kings were a mean of leading many of their &s;ubjects to idolatry and vice. It is &s;aid of Jeroboam, that he not only &s;inned him&s;elf, but "he made I&s;rael to &s;in." We might name many other kings, of Judah and I&s;rael, who&s;e evil example was de&s;tructive of the morals of &s;ociety; and al&s;o many in&s;tances of the kind in more mo|dern times. The common di&s;cernment of the world has remarked, that a vicious prince will ren|der vice fa&s;hionable in his court; and a vicious court will di&s;&s;eminate vice through the various parts of the &s;tate or nation. That the national court impart &s;omething of their own ca&s;t of mind, and give currency to certain modes of conduct, among&s;t the people, may appear from the two following in&s;tances:&mdash;When Oliver Cromwell a&s;&s;umed the government of England, and had the addre&s;s to create a court after his own image, a
<PB N="10" REF="037663_0010_100F356421954270">
great part of the people appeared to partake of his fervent &s;pirit, and of his impetuous and un|governable temper. Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> Charles the Second, who &s;oon &s;ucceeded Cromwell, was re&s;tored to the throne, he &s;oon made it evident that he was de|voted to riotous plea&s;ures, and to degrading indo|lence. His indecent and vicious morals had a ruinous influence on the court, which &s;oon be|came the very nur&s;ery of vice. The theatres al&s;o, which were e&s;tabli&s;hed for the cultivation of good morals, and for the excitement of com|mendable emulation and refinement, were pro&s;ti|tuted to the exhibition of &s;cenes of impurity. Thus a vicious king corrupted the morals both of the court and the &s;tage, from which &s;ources immorality had an alarming prevalence through the nation. His reign gave countenance to men of dei&s;tical &s;entiments, &s;ome of whom were eminent for their abilities, and came forth with all po&s;&s;ible freedom in &s;upport of their cau&s;e, being encoura|ged, in their attacks on divine revelation, by the demoralizing opinions and practices of their prince and his favourites at court.</P>
<P>Again: That irreligious rulers give currency to vice among their &s;ubjects, has received recent con|firmation. We have lived to pa&s;s the degenerat|ed period, when the legi&s;lature of the <HI>great and dread|ful
<PB N="11" REF="037663_0011_100F3566B236FB00">
republic</HI> gave their cheerful a&s;&s;ent to &s;uch pro|fane &s;entiments as the&s;e&mdash;"That death is an eter|nal &s;leep&mdash;that rea&s;on dethrones both the kings of the earth, and the kings of heaven&mdash;that man, when free, wants no other divinity than him&s;elf&mdash;and that every republic, but a republic of athei&s;ts, is a chimera." Under the influence of &s;uch opinions, they have pro&s;cribed the holy Sabbath, and all the in&s;titutions of the go&s;pel. The natural effects of this licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the national court have been already realized. All the vile pa&s;&s;ions which agi|tate the human mind have received encouragements Vice, in all its mo&s;t extravagant forms, has tri|umphed over &s;ocial order and religion. "<HI>The wick|ed walk on every &s;ide taken the vile&s;t men are exalted."</HI></P>
<P>In connexion with the above ob&s;ervations, as to the pernicious influence of immorality in princes, and men of eminence in &s;ociety, we remark, that had our illu&s;trious and <HI>departed</HI> PATRIOT, when Commander of our armies, or Pre&s;ident of our na|tional court, exhibited an example of vicious mo|rals&punc; and di&s;regard to the in&s;titutions of religion&mdash;had be been devoted to plea&s;ure; and a &s;upporter of di&s;&s;ipation, &s;he unhappy and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">nous effects would have been felt through every part of our nation. But his example being the rever&s;e of this, i. e. mo&s;t amiable, dignified, and worthy of uni|ver&s;al
<PB N="12" REF="037663_0012_100F35699342B1D0">
imitation, the advantages hence re&s;ulting have been ine&s;timably great. In this view of his character, his death we lament; "his memory is ble&s;&s;ed," and his name will live in the grateful and la&s;ting remembrance of his countrymen.</P>
<P>In this connexion we may &s;ee our obligations to unite in thankful prai&s;e to Him <HI>by whom princes and judges rule,</HI>" in that he hath again rai&s;ed to the Pre|&s;idency of our nation one who is explicitly attached to the religion of the go&s;pel, and who&s;e virtuous example is al&s;o a pointed condemnation of immo|rality and vice.</P>
<P N="2">2. Samuel lived in the time of a great revolution in I&s;rael&mdash;while an important change took place in their government. In their revolution Samuel was an eminent character. His wi&s;dom and integrity &s;hone con&s;picuou&s;ly. He was held in high e&s;ti|mation by the people, as one faithful to the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him, and as an un&s;haken friend to their true intere&s;t and happine&s;s. Though, in the fer|vency and extravagance of party &s;pirit, &s;ome dared to oppo&s;e the mea&s;ures which he recommended&mdash;though &s;ome &s;pake evil of his dignity, and in&s;inuat|ed that he was a man of corrupt de&s;igns&mdash;yet, when he was dead, they became convinced that he was wi&s;e in coun&s;el, and that his intentions were good. All the people remembered his advice, his virtues
<PB N="13" REF="037663_0013_100F356B1FFBBE80">
and his u&s;efulne&s;s, and hence lamented him as a fa|ther in I&s;rael, and a friend thereof.</P>
<P>Our <HI>decea&s;ed</HI> PATRIOT and friend lived, like Samuel, in a time of great revolution. He has been looked to, in a time of univer&s;al alarm, danger and anxiety, as a mo&s;t con&s;picuous and u&s;eful man; and his important &s;ervices have exceeded in value the &s;upporting anticipations of his warme&s;t friends. Were we to attempt a particular delineation of his virtues, and a repre&s;entation of his u&s;efulne&s;s, in the time of <HI>our</HI> revolution, the &s;ubject would beg|gar all de&s;cription. Our greate&s;t efforts mu&s;t clo&s;e in the language of the queen of Sheba when &s;he came to &s;urvey the glory of Solomon&mdash;"The one half of the greatne&s;s of thy wi&s;dom is not told, for thou exceede&s;t the fame that I have heard of thee." Let us therefore come down to humble expre&s;&s;ions, and content our&s;elves with &s;aying, that his emi|nent u&s;efulne&s;s is acknowledged by all cla&s;&s;es of our citizens, and that nothing can be added in his prai&s;e, which could excite an higher &s;en&s;e of his worth than is now engraven on the hearts of his countrymen. If all I&s;rael had rea&s;on to lament the death of Samuel, all our united tribes are cal|led to mourn the departure of our beloved CHIEF, in the grateful remembrance of his &s;ervices.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="037663_0014_100F356CC14D09D0">
If &s;ome, in the time of public tumult, party &s;pirit and prejudice in I&s;rael, dared to reproach the conduct of Samuel, who&s;e whole life was as irre|proachable as that of any man with whom the world has been honoured; then, though &s;ome have pre&s;umed to blame the admini&s;tration of him for whom we now mourn, we are not to con&s;ider this as a &s;ingular in&s;tance of vile pa&s;&s;ion in man, nor as evidence again&s;t the venerable accu&s;ed, that he was defective as to wi&s;dom, or depraved in his de&s;igns. Tho&s;e who have wicked|ly repre&s;ented his intentions as vile and pernicious, will probably learn their error and guilt with re|gret; and perhaps &s;ome will come to this &s;en&s;e when it is too late, there being no more &s;pace for repentance.</P>
<P N="3">3. Under the direction of Samuel, the I&s;raelites had great &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t their enemies. It is &s;aid, "The hand of the Lord was again&s;t the enemies of I&s;rael all the days of Samuel." He was a faith|ful &s;ervant of the public. His wi&s;dom and exer|tions were a mean of the pre&s;ervation of his country, when threatened with ruin by invading foes. He was an eminent in&s;trument, in the hand of Providence, of their &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t tho&s;e who violated their rights. The people had a grateful remembrance of his invaluable &s;ervices, and hence
<PB N="15" REF="037663_0015_100F356E66389778">
indulged undi&s;&s;embled lamentation at his death.</P>
<P>The world has been a&s;toni&s;hed at the &s;ucce&s;s of the American arms, under the wi&s;e arrangements of our highly-favoured Commander, who is now no more. His faithfulne&s;s in the cau&s;e of his country is confe&s;&s;ed by all who have come to the knowledge of his hi&s;tory. We honour him, as having been a con&s;picuous in&s;trument, in the hand of kind Providence, of our &s;alvation, when op|pre&s;&s;ive enemies &s;ought our ruin. He has not borne the &s;word in vain, but with great and hap|py &s;ucce&s;s, again&s;t foreign enemies, the enemies of the wilderne&s;s, and the &s;till more unrea&s;onable enemies of our happine&s;s who have ari&s;en among our&s;elves. His ine&s;timable labours have endear|ed and will perpetuate his name.</P>
<P>The evident benevolence which excited him to &s;ubmit to the toils of war, and to burden him&s;elf with the high re&s;pon&s;ibility attached to his civil admini&s;trations, &s;how him to have been an enemy to vile oppre&s;&s;ion, and an immutable friend to the intere&s;t and happine&s;s of his country. As Sa|muel's whole life rendered it evident that he was not &s;eeking to enrich him&s;elf with the property of his people, no le&s;s noble has been the conduct of our <HI>renowned Philanthropi&s;t,</HI> who&s;e &s;ervices are now ended. That to increa&s;e his property was not his
<PB N="16" REF="037663_0016_100F35716B386460">
object, in all the cares, toils, dangers and &s;uffer|ings in which he engaged, and which he &s;upported with wi&s;dom, fortitude and per&s;everance, for the good of his country, it is evident, in that he would accept no compen&s;ation. It is true, he was able to &s;upport him&s;elf upon his own property; but is it common that men are willing to labour for nothing becau&s;e they are affluent? Do we often find it the ca&s;e that men of fortune are unwilling to add to their &s;tock, by receiving a full reward for their &s;ervices? Let captious prejudice &s;ay what it will, we are bound, by the laws of charity, to call this refu&s;al of compen&s;ation benevolence. It looks like "love which &s;eeketh not her own," and is to be con&s;idered in this light. This refu&s;al of com|pen&s;ation is &s;till one of the lea&s;t of the evidences of his di&s;intere&s;ted love to his country. He made a much greater &s;acrifice than this, in relinqui&s;hing the charms of retirement, and in &s;ubjecting him&s;elf to the toils and hazards of the public offices to which he has been called. If, therefore, we are capable of gratitude, we &s;hall exerci&s;e it in a view of the&s;e benevolent &s;ervices. If we love that which is great and good, we &s;hall admire this no|blene&s;s of &s;oul. If worth of character can excite our e&s;teem, and the death of &s;uch, our grief, we &s;hall weep on the tomb of our GREAT and HO|NOURABLE FRIEND.</P>

4. Samuel was a great Civilian, and was known as a judge in I&s;rael, throughout all their tribes. "He went in circuit from year to year to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged I&s;rael in all tho&s;e places." He was acknowledged as wi&s;e and impartial, and was highly re&s;pected by the people. It is &s;aid, "All the people greatly feared him." Being &s;o generally known, &s;o eminently ju&s;t and u&s;eful, and &s;o highly re&s;pected, his death came near to every heart&mdash;it was afflictive, and excited general lamentation.

<P>Our great Civilian, and our Leader in arms, who now &s;leeps in death, was known through all our tribes.

His wi&s;dom and his integrity were indi&s;putable, both in the cabinet and in the field of war. His u&s;efulne&s;s was eminent, both as a law|giver to our country, and a defender of our rights. We felt intere&s;ted in his honour and happine&s;s&mdash;we were profited by his &s;ervices&mdash;we delighted in &s;howing him re&s;pect, and we had no fear of excit|ing envy in any who were le&s;s noticed.

over him in the language of the king of I&s;rael over the departing prophet&mdash;"O my father! my fa|ther!"</P>
<P N="5">5. There followed the revolution in I&s;rael, or the change of their government, a great and threat|ening divi&s;ion among&s;t the people. Their political ideas were extremely confu&s;ed, and their pa&s;&s;ions were all in arms. The people were divided into two great and powerful parties: Saul was at the head of one, and David was the leader of the other. Samuel, in this &s;ea&s;on of alarm and di&s;tre&s;s, gave an example of moderation, wi&s;dom, and fortitude, which de&s;erves the admiration of the world. He reproved the malevolence, the envy and the mer|cenary intentions of tho&s;e who de&s;erved &s;uch re|buke, with all the &s;olemnity and faithfulne&s;s of an angel from heaven. He put him&s;elf forward, as a terror to evil doers, with all the maje&s;ty of an arm|ed ho&s;t. <HI>Who,</HI> therefore, can &s;ufficiently admire the wi&s;dom of his coun&s;els, and form a ju&s;t e&s;ti|mate of the worth of his &s;ervices? It is fully pro|bable, that he was the mean, in the hand of Provi|dence, of &s;aving the tribes of I&s;rael from incalcu|lable lo&s;s of blood and trea&s;ure. Like an angel of peace, his wi&s;dom and mediation &s;aved them from di&s;tre&s;&s;es and woes inde&s;cribable. How deep and real, therefore, mu&s;t have been the lamenta|tion at his death!</P>

The&s;e remarks on Samuel apply with equal truth to "America's Favourite Son," who&s;e memory will ever be dear to us all. He has lived to &s;ee envy, party &s;pirit and prejudice ri&s;e up among&s;t our&s;elves, after a very important revolution in our favour. He has &s;een the pa&s;&s;ion and un&s;ubmi&s;&s;ive &s;pirit of party ari&s;e with weapons of war to oppo&s;e the admini&s;tration of government. He has &s;een the order and tranquillity of the nation mo&s;t alarmingly threatened, by tho&s;e who have loved &s;trangers rather than tho&s;e of their own hou&s;e. His wi&s;dom, &s;tability, and per&s;everance in con|&s;titutional righteou&s;ne&s;s, in the&s;e &s;ea&s;ons of tumult and danger, have been ble&s;&s;ed: they have been a mean of re&s;toring order where confu&s;ion began to &s;pread its mi&s;eries. He hath di&s;played him&s;elf as became one whom kind Pro|vidence had rai&s;ed up to be a mini&s;ter of God for good to the people, and to bear the &s;word of ju&s;|tice and order not in vain&mdash;to rebuke the madne&s;s of di&s;obedience, and to protect the friends of order and civil happine&s;s. In the &s;en&s;e in which Samuel was a Saviour of I&s;rael, our PATRIOT and GUAR|DIAN, who has now cea&s;ed from his labours, was the Saviour of his country. As Samuel's wi&s;dom, coun&s;els and virtue were a mean of pre&s;erving di&s;|ordered I&s;rael from total confu&s;ion, and univer&s;al
<PB N="20" REF="037663_0020_100F357A599F2C70">
wretchedne&s;s, &s;o <HI>his</HI> di&s;cernment and efforts have probably been a mean, in the hand of Providence, of our pre&s;ervation from &s;editions, tumults and blood. His name &s;hall live in the hearts of his countrymen. He &s;hall be held in remembrance of tho&s;e yet to be born. Fathers &s;hall &s;peak of his important &s;ervices, with gratitude and admiration, "to their &s;ons and to their &s;ons' &s;ons." His me|mory is and will be "ble&s;&s;ed."</P>
<P N="6">6. The I&s;raelites lamented for Samuel, becau&s;e they felt their need of his future coun&s;els and la|bours. The civil commotions in I&s;rael continued at the time of his death. Saul and David each had their parties and adherents. It was a day of great darkne&s;s and terror. They were threatened by their powerful enemies, the Phili&s;tines. This with the riotous and party &s;pirit of their own na|tion, excited great alarm and anxiety. Not only their enemies from abroad, but the violence of par|ty among them&s;elves, threatened the ruin of the &s;tate. Saul continued to pur&s;ue David, with envy, malevolence and murder in his heart. David and his men were hunted in the woods of Pale&s;tine&mdash;they were oppre&s;&s;ed, and cha&s;ed in their minds&mdash;they were valiant in battle&mdash;there was rea&s;on why the people &s;hould tremble in fear of the fatal i&s;&s;ue of the&s;e circum&s;tances. The people felt
<PB N="21" REF="037663_0021_100F357D23A47B30">
their need of the wi&s;dom, experience, fortitude and prudence of Samuel, to moderate, direct and tranquilize the public mind, which had now be|come re&s;tle&s;s and pa&s;&s;ionate.</P>
<P><HI>We</HI> feel <HI>our</HI> need of the continued &s;ervices of our <HI>wi&s;e and experienced Leader</HI> in coun&s;el and arms, who is now &s;ilent in death, having fini&s;hed his cour&s;e. His prayer was, "that man might no longer be the enemy of man;" but this his benevolent &s;up|plication is not yet an&s;wered. The world is in trouble&mdash;a martial &s;pirit has pervaded the na|tions&mdash;tho&s;e with which we have intercour&s;e are paraded in arms. We have enemies abroad&mdash;we have the di&s;contented and mutinous at home&mdash;the &s;torm gathers around us, and threatens to bur&s;t its thunders on our heads.</P>
<P>We are in danger of being drawn into the vortex of war, and its mi&s;eries. While we pray that the God of armies, and the God of mercy, would &s;ave us from the&s;e woes, we have to lament the lo&s;s of one who has been honoured as an in&s;trument of our country's &s;alvation, in perilous times; who&s;e aid and experience we &s;till need; who&s;e wi&s;dom and valour had acquired univer&s;al confidence, and who&s;e very name in&s;pired the &s;ons of America with fortitude and hope.</P>

7. The I&s;raelites mourned for Samuel in the re|membrance of his warnings and exhortations a|gain&s;t political jealou&s;ies, and &s;edition. In a time of di&s;affection toward their government, and when many were indulging complaint, Samuel received direction from the Lord to "prote&s;t &s;olemnly un|to the people, and to &s;how them the manner of the king," or the unhappine&s;s of that government, un|der which they &s;ought to place them&s;elves. "Ne|verthele&s;s, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he people refu&s;ed to obey the voice of Samuel" in this re&s;pect; though he was faithful in his admonitions, and &s;howed him&s;elf a friend to their be&s;t intere&s;ts. Our <HI>celebrated Civilian,</HI> decea&s;|ed, has &s;olemnly admoni&s;hed his fellow citizens again&s;t &s;editious principles, and a riotous oppo&s;ition to the e&s;tabli&s;hed government. The following &s;entiments are his: "The very idea of the power and the right of the people to e&s;tabli&s;h govern|ment, pre&s;uppo&s;es the duty of every individual to obey the e&s;tabli&s;hed government. All ob&s;tructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and a&s;&s;ociations, under whatever plau&s;ible character, with the real de&s;ign to direct, controul, counteract or awe the regular deliberation and action of the con&s;tituted authorities, are de&s;tructive of this fun|damental principle, and of fatal tendency." This admonition is fitted to &s;uppre&s;s licentious politics,
<PB N="23" REF="037663_0023_100F358233C66CD0">
and to direct public opinion in the way of &s;obriety, order, and civil happine&s;s. And &s;uch is the &s;tate of man, that popular opinion is in con&s;tant need of &s;uch direction, becau&s;e its frailties greatly expo&s;e it to a wrong bias; and, when this is the ca&s;e, it can ea&s;ily &s;ubvert the be&s;t mode of government, and trample on tho&s;e laws which promi&s;e &s;afety to the public. Under &s;uch warnings of our enlight|ened In&s;tructor, who, "though dead, yet &s;peak|eth," let us watch again&s;t a &s;editious &s;pirit, and tho&s;e irritating jealou&s;ies which &s;ap the foundation of public tranquillity, and which tend to involve in irreparable di&s;orders and &s;ufferings.</P>
<P N="8">8. All the I&s;raelites lamented the death of Samu|el. Let us put empha&s;is on the word <HI>all,</HI> and con&s;i|der the rea&s;on why <HI>all</HI> I&s;rael were afflicted by this e|vent. Samuel was a public benefactor: he had wrought in the &s;ervice of his country, and &s;pent his life for its good. <HI>All</HI> had derived advantages from his wi&s;dom, and from his faithfulne&s;s to their intere&s;ts and happine&s;s. Univer&s;al te&s;timonials of re&s;pect and mourning at his death were a tribute due to his memory, and &s;uitably expre&s;&s;ive of the public &s;en&s;e of his worth. We are called to mourn, with all our brethren of the United States, the decea&s;e of <HI>our mo&s;t worthy and honourable Friend,</HI> as for a pub|lic benefactor. From his youth he devoted
<PB N="24" REF="037663_0024_100F358502CFBA00">
him&s;elf to the &s;ervice of his country, and has &s;pent an invaluable life in the promotion of public hap|pine&s;s. He has &s;u&s;tained the mo&s;t arduous offices, and filled them with &s;ingular dignity, not with an ultimate view to acquire the applau&s;e of men, but to procure la&s;ting advantages for his people. His benevolent purpo&s;es have met with &s;urpri&s;ing &s;uc|ce&s;s. We have all derived benefits from his wi&s;|dom, his labours and &s;ufferings. His life was a ble&s;&s;ing to every <HI>individual</HI> in United America, and we <HI>all</HI> owe him a weighty and plea&s;ing debt of gra|titude. His unremitting exertions at the head of our armies, and in the chair of &s;tate, have been a di&s;tingui&s;hed mean of the e&s;tabli&s;hment and pre&s;er|vation of our rights and liberties, civil and reli|gious, which we hold as valuable beyond all com|putation.</P>
<P>The arms of death have now embraced this <HI>our great and honourable Friend</HI>&mdash;who has &s;ubmitted to numberle&s;s perils and toils for our good&mdash;who has traver&s;ed the bloody camp to protect us, and give us liberty&mdash;who has left the &s;weets of retirement, and placed him&s;elf at the helm of government, to &s;ave us from wreck and torture&mdash;who has &s;howed him&s;elf the friend of God, the friend of man, the friend of his country, the &s;upporter of that religion which is nece&s;&s;ary to our pre&s;ent and ultimate hap|pine&s;s
<PB N="25" REF="037663_0025_100F3586907C0050">
&mdash;and who has exhibited a public example of all tho&s;e virtues which dignify the character of man, and render &s;ocial intercour&s;e de&s;irable. Let our nation therefore be clad in &s;ackcloth, for "the mighty man is fallen"&mdash;the beauty and delight of our I&s;rael is no more. "Ye daughters" of Ame|rica, "weep over him who hath clothed you with &s;carlet, and with other delights, and who hath put ornaments of gold on your apparel."</P>
<P N="9">9. Public mourning for Samuel, and mourning on &s;uch an occa&s;ion as now invites our grief, is &s;uitable, becau&s;e it is but a ju&s;t acknowledgment of the virtues and worth of tho&s;e who&s;e death is thus lamented. It is an evidence of public grati|tude for what they have done for the good of their country, and for the benefit of the world. Be&s;ide, public te&s;timonials of re&s;pect for the memory of tho&s;e decea&s;ed, who have been eminently virtuous and u&s;eful, has a favourable influence on the living. It operates as an encouragement to the living to imitate the example of the honourable dead. A man fir&s;t in the command of an army, or one high in the &s;eats of civil admini&s;tration, mu&s;t feel a de|pre&s;&s;ion and di&s;couragement, on finding the &s;ervi|ces of the virtuous and faithful in office rewarded with public ungratefulne&s;s and complaint. The cares, toils and re&s;pon&s;ibility of &s;uch offices, when
<PB N="26" REF="037663_0026_100F3588219D1270">
filled with wi&s;dom and dignity, ought to be &s;up|ported with the candour, affection and grati|tude of the public mind. When it is made evident that public gratitude is excited toward tho&s;e who have &s;erved their country with wi&s;dom and fideli|ty, in the mo&s;t important offices&mdash;when the labours and anxieties of &s;uch offices are rewarded with the affections and confidence of the people, who ari&s;e at their decea&s;e, and pronounce their memory ble&s;|&s;ed&mdash;then encouragement and &s;upport are given, both to the warrior and civilian, amid&s;t all the ha|zards and wearine&s;s of office.</P>
<P>Hence let the affectionate re&s;pect which appears through our country, for the memory of her de|parted <HI>Guardian</HI> and <HI>Friend,</HI> be con&s;idered as proper and important, not only as it is a tribute due to his worth, but on account of its favourable influ|ence on the living. Let tho&s;e who now, or may hereafter, fill the important offices which he hath borne, be encouraged to &s;eek for the wi&s;dom which directed him, and to imitate all his virtues. And may they and all the people pray, in imitation of the prophet Eli&s;ha, that a double portion of WASHINGTON's &s;pirit may re&s;t on his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors in office. While we remember his mo&s;t important &s;ervices, and retain an high affection for his name&mdash;while we look up to his worth as be|yond
<PB N="27" REF="037663_0027_100F358B08BEB178">
our e&s;timation, and indulge in impre&s;&s;ive accents of &s;orrow at his death&mdash;it becomes us to acknowledge the righteou&s;ne&s;s of that providence which has laid him in his tomb. "Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and &s;hall we not receive evil?"</P>
<P>Our Heavenly Benefactor is to be prai&s;ed in that he hath rai&s;ed <HI>one</HI> to the head of our national con|cerns, in whom all tho&s;e virtues remarkably cen|tred which qualified him for office, and rendered him &s;o <HI>univer&s;ally</HI> and <HI>peculiarly</HI> acceptable to the people. In this view of divine goodne&s;s, and the favour granted us, we may adopt the &s;entiments which were entertained in the contemplation of Solomon's wi&s;dom and excellence, and which were expre&s;&s;ed in the&s;e words&mdash;"Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord thy God, who delighted in thee, to &s;et thee on his throne, to be king for the Lord thy God; becau&s;e thy God loved I&s;rael to e&s;tabli&s;h them forever, therefore made he thee king over them, to do judgment and ju&s;tice."</P>
<P>We clo&s;e with ob&s;erving, that the death which we now lament gives us a &s;olemn le&s;&s;on on human frailty. The "prophets lived not forever." "Samuel died, and all I&s;rael lamented him, and buried him in his own &s;epulchre at Ramah." WASHINGTON, our friend and benefactor, is
<PB N="28" REF="037663_0028_100F358DCEBFF870">
dead, and laid in his own tomb at Mount Vernon. He, who has &s;tood protected while thou&s;ands have fallen around him, has now pa&s;t the vale of death, after a &s;hort indi&s;po&s;ition. He, who was rai&s;ed to the &s;ummit of human glory, dies like other men. He, who has made legions of invading foes to &s;ub|mit, mu&s;t him&s;elf &s;ubmit to the irre&s;i&s;tible power of the king of terrors. He, who&s;e per&s;on was ad|mired, and whom multitudes &s;ought to behold, is now hidden from the eyes of mortals, and left to moulder back to du&s;t. He, who gave laws to millions, mu&s;t him&s;elf &s;ubmit to the de|crees of his Maker. Thus "the world is pa&s;&s;ing away"&mdash;the glory of kingdoms is fading. "The wi&s;e and reverend head" mu&s;t lie on a level with others. In the judgment of the Great Day, there will be no di&s;tinction, but that which ari&s;es from different tempers of heart: Though the death of the righteous cau&s;e grief, <HI>yet to them it is gain.</HI> While their memory is ble&s;&s;ed on earth, their &s;pirits a&s;|cend to the perfect and endle&s;s enjoyment of God. Glory and prai&s;e to the riches of that grace which brings the departed &s;aint to the triumphant &s;ong&mdash;"<HI>O Death, where is thy &s;ting? O Grave, where is thy victory?"</HI></P>
<P>To &s;erve God with faithfulne&s;s in the different &s;pheres of action in which his providence hath
<PB N="29" REF="037663_0029_100F358F5C337B80">
placed us, is the great bu&s;ine&s;s of life&mdash;the way to a happy death, and to an eternal re&s;t with Chri&s;t, in his kingdom of unfading glory.</P>
<P>May we be thus wi&s;e, and ble&s;&s;ed of God, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t. AMEN.</P>

<HEAD>AN HISTORICAL SKETCH.</HEAD>
<P>"THE ance&s;tors of General Wa&s;hington came from England in the year 1657. He is in the third de&s;cent after their migration. He was born the 11th of February (old &s;tyle) 1732, at the pari&s;h of Wa&s;hington, in We&s;tmoreland Country, Virginia. His education was principally conducted by a pri|vate tutor. Before he attained his twentieth year, he was rai&s;ed to the in&s;pection of a military di&s;trict in Virginia, with the rank of Major. In 1753, when he was little more than twenty-one years of age, he was appointed an agent to treat with the French, who had made encroachments on the territories of the then Briti&s;h colonies at the we&s;tward. He was entru&s;ted with plenary power for the manage|ment of this important bu&s;ine&s;s, and pur&s;ued the duties of his mi&s;&s;ion with &s;ingular indu&s;try, wi&s;|dom and addre&s;s; but had not the happine&s;s to prevent a war between England and France. The next year, 1754, he was appointed Lieutenant Co|lonel in the Virginia regiment. The chief colonel dying the &s;ame year, without joining the regiment, the command and rank of Colonel devolved on him. He formed a plan to e&s;tabli&s;h po&s;ts for the defence of the frontiers, at the confluence of the
<PB N="30" REF="037663_0030_100F359115E9A268">
Allegany and Monongahela rivers. Pur&s;uing this object, with only 400 effective men, he was met with an army of the enemy, computed at 1500, and after a gallant and well-managed defence, in which more than one third of his men were kil|led and wounded, he was obliged to capitulate. He, however, &s;ecured the important condition of retiring with the honours of war; but his men were brutally plundered by the Indians.</P>
<P>"In 1755 the Briti&s;h government &s;ent Gen. Brad|dock with an army to repel the&s;e invaders. Wa&s;h|ington was received as Aid-de Camp to Gen. Braddock, with the rank of Colonel." Pre&s;ident Davies, in a &s;ermon preached to Capt. Overton's company of volunteers, who were rai&s;ed in Vir|ginia for this expedition, bore this honourable and prophetic te&s;timony in favour of the &s;ince Com|mander of the American armies:&mdash;Said he, "I point out to the public that heroic youth, Col. Wa&s;hington, whom I cannot but hope Providence has hitherto pre&s;erved in &s;o &s;ignal a manner for &s;ome important &s;ervice to his country."</P>
<Q REND="inline normQuotes"><P>In this year was the memorable battle and defeat of Braddock, at the Monongahela. Gen. Braddock was killed, and all his officers, who were obliged to be on hor&s;eback, were killed or wounded, excepting Col. Wa&s;hington; who di&s;|played great fortitude and military &s;kill in &s;aving the wreck of this mutilated army. Soon after this, on account of his &s;ingular merit, he was ho|noured with the command of all the troops rai&s;ed and to be rai&s;ed in Virginia. He continued to di&s;play his military talents in the defence of the frontiers. In 1758 he commanded a van brigade in the capture of fort Du Que&s;ne.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s of this campaign having &s;ecured tranquillity to the middle colonies, and his health being extremely impaired, in 1759 he re&s;igned his appointment.</P>

He gradually recovered his health&mdash;married Mrs. Cu&s;tis, a re&s;pectable young widow&mdash;&s;ettled on his e&s;tate at Mount Vernon, and gave his at|tention to agriculture. After he left the army in '59 he was con&s;tantly a member of the Virginia A&s;&s;embly, a magi&s;trate of his county, and a judge of the court," until the year 1774, when he was elected a delegate to the fir&s;t Continental Con|gre&s;s. In 1775 he was appointed Commander in Chief of the continental army. From this time he &s;ubmitted to more than "Herculean labours" in watching the movements of an in&s;idious and powerful foe, and in bringing his variable and un|di&s;ciplined army to the mo&s;t promi&s;ing point of re&s;i&s;tance.</P></Q>
<P>Under the mo&s;t depre&s;&s;ive circum&s;tances&mdash;in want of a regular force competent to the exigen|ces of the day&mdash;in want of food, clothing and pay for his &s;uffering companions in the field&mdash;his mag|nanimity and tru&s;t in Providence &s;upported his hope. The &s;ufferings of his army, in the want of a generous and promi&s;ed &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, excited re|peated mutinies among the &s;oldiery, and awakened the mo&s;t threatening di&s;contents among many of his officers. The&s;e &s;ea&s;ons of mo&s;t imminent dan|ger arou&s;ed his powers of oratory, in which there was unparalleled per&s;ua&s;ion, which &s;u&s;tained our cau&s;e, and &s;aved our country.</P>
<P>The magnitude of the cau&s;e which he was en|gaged to &s;upport, and the unequalled tru&s;t he had taken on him&s;elf, mu&s;t have lain with inexpre&s;&s;ible we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n his mind. He &s;u&s;tained this mighty burden, until the ever-memorable victory at York-town, which afforded him a partial relief. This event (the capture of lord Cornwallis and the Briti&s;h army under his command, which took place in October, 1781) laid a foundation for peace be|tween the United States and Great Britain. Peace was realized in 1783. In 1787 General Wa&s;h|ington was elected Pre&s;ident of the General Con|vention
<PB N="32" REF="037663_0032_100F35962AC5CC70">
which formed the con&s;titution of the United States. The fir&s;t Congre&s;s, under the new con&s;titution, convened March, 1787, and on the 30th of April GEORGE WASHINGTON was de|clared Pre&s;ident of the United States. He was re|elected to the Pre&s;idency in 1793. In '97 he re|tired&punc; from public &s;ervice, having declined being con&s;idered as a candidate for the future &s;uffrages of his fellow citizens. In '98 he was appointed General and Commander in Chief of the Armies of the United States, of which he accepted; in this, giving the mo&s;t impre&s;&s;ive evidence of his benevo|lence to his country, and that the greatne&s;s of his mind was above the punctilios of rank.&mdash;He died December 14th, 1799, Aet. 68.</P>
