<HEAD>THE TWO SHOEMAKERS.</HEAD>
<P>JACKBROWN and JAMES STOCK, were two lads apprentic'd at nearly the &s;ame time, to Mr. Williams, a Shoe|maker, in a &s;mall town in Oxford&s;hire; they were pretty near the &s;ame age, but of very different characters and di&s;po|&s;itions.</P>
<P>Brown was elde&s;t &s;on to a farmer in good circum&s;tances, who gave the u&s;ual prentice fee with him. Being a wild giddy boy, whom his father could not well manage or in&s;truct in farming he thought it better to &s;end him out to learn a trade at a di&s;tance, than to let him idle about at home: for Jack always preferred bird's ne&s;ting and marbles to any other employment; and would trifle away half the day, when his father
<PB N="4" REF="037145_0003_100C94F0908581E8">
thought he was at &s;chool, with any boys he could meet with, who were as idle as him&s;elf; and never could be pre|vailed upon to do, or to learn any thing, while a game at taw could be had for love or money. All this time his little brothers, much younger than him&s;elf, were beginning to follow the plough, or to carry the corn to mill as &s;oon as they were able to mount a cart-hor&s;e.</P>
<P>Jack, however, who was a lively boy, and did not naturally want either &s;en&s;e or good nature might have turned out well enough, if he had not had the misfortune to be his mother's favourite. She concealed and forgave all his faults.&mdash;<Q>To be &s;ure he was a little wild,</Q> &s;he would &s;ay, <Q>but he would not make a wor&s;e man for that, for Jack had a good &s;pirit of his own, and &s;he would not have it broke, and &s;o make a mope of the boy.</Q> The farm|er, for a quiet life as it is called, gave up all the&s;e points to his wife; and with them, gave up the future virtue and happine&s;s of his child. He was a
<PB N="5" REF="037145_0004_100C94F289B07FD0">
laborious and indu&s;trious man but he had no religion; he thought only of the gains and advantages of the pre&s;ent day, and never took the future into the account. His wife managed him entirely, and as &s;he was really notable, he did not trou|ble his head about any thing farther. If &s;he had been carele&s;s in her dairy, he would have &s;tormed and &s;wore; but as &s;he only ruined one child by in|dulgence, and almo&s;t broke the hearts of the re&s;t by unkindne&s;s, he gave him|&s;elf little concern about the matter. The chee&s;e, certainly was good, and that indeed is a great point; but &s;he was neglectful of her children, and a tyrant to her &s;ervants. Her hu&s;band's &s;ub&s;tance, indeed, was not wa&s;ted, but his happine&s;s was not con&s;ulted. His hou&s;e, it is true, was not dirty, but it was the abode of fury, ill-temper, and covetou&s;ne&s;s. And the farmer who did not care for drink, was too often driven to the publick-hou&s;e of an evening, be|cau&s;e his own was neither quiet nor comfortable. The mother was always &s;colding, and the children were always crying.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="037145_0005_100C94F4166FF520">
Jack, however, notwith&s;tanding his idlene&s;s, picked up a little reading and writing, but never would learn to ca&s;t an account: that was too much labour. His mother was de&s;irous he &s;hould con|tinue at &s;chool, not &s;o much for the &s;ake of his learning, which &s;he had not &s;en&s;e enough to value, but to &s;ave her darling from the fatigue of labour; for if he had not gone to &s;chool, &s;he knew he mu&s;t have gone to work, and &s;he thought the former was the lea&s;t tire&s;ome of the two. Indeed this fooli&s;h woman had &s;uch an opinion of his genius, that &s;he u&s;ed from a child, to think he was too wi&s;e for a|ny thing but a par&s;on, and hoped &s;he &s;hould live to &s;ee him one. She did not wi&s;h to &s;ee her &s;on a mini&s;ter be|cau&s;e &s;he loved either learning or goodne&s;s, but becau&s;e &s;he thought it would make Jack a gentleman, and &s;et him above his brothers.</P>
<P>Farmer Brown &s;till hoped, that though Jack was likely to make but an idle and ignorant farmer, yet he might make no bad trade&s;man when he &s;hould be remo|ved
<PB N="7" REF="037145_0006_100C94F62AF99E10">
from the indulgences of a father's hou&s;e, and from a &s;illy mother, who&s;e fondne&s;s kept him back in every thing. This woman was enraged when &s;he found that &s;o fine a &s;cholar as &s;he took Jack to be, was to be put apprentice to a &s;hoemaker. The farmer, however, for the fir&s;t time in his life, would have his own way. But being a worldly man, and too apt to mind only what is fal&s;ely called <HI>the main chance;</HI> in&s;tead of be|ing careful to look out for a &s;ober, prudent, and religious ma&s;ter for his &s;on, he left all that to chance, as if it had been a thing of little or no con&s;equence. This is a very common fault; and fa|thers who are guilty of it, are in a great mea&s;ure an&s;werable for the future &s;ins and errors of their children, when they grow up in the world, and &s;et up for them&s;elves. If a man gives his &s;on a good education, a good example, and a good ma&s;ter, it is indeed <HI>possible</HI> that the &s;on may not turn out well, but it does not often happen; and when it does, the father has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o blame re&s;ting on him; and it is a great point towards a man's
<PB N="8" REF="037145_0007_100C94F86D74C3B8">
comfort to have his con&s;cience quiet in that re&s;pect, however GOD may over|rule events.</P>
<P>The farmer however, took care to de|&s;ire his friends to enquire for a &s;hoema|ker who had good bu&s;ine&s;s, and was a good workman; and the mother did not forget to put in her word, and de&s;ired that it might be one who was not too &s;trict; for Jack had been brought up tenderly, was a meek boy, and could not bear to be contradicted in any thing. And this is the common notion of meek|ne&s;s among people who know no better.</P>
<P>Mr. Williams was recommended to the farmer as being the be&s;t &s;hoemaker in the town where he lived, and far from a &s;trict ma&s;ter; and without fur|ther inquiries, to Mr. Williams he went.</P>
<P>JAMES STOCK, who was the &s;on of an hone&s;t labourer in the next village, was bound out by the pari&s;h, in con&s;idera|tion of his father having &s;o numerous a
<PB N="9" REF="037145_0008_100C94FAED5BE488">
family, that he was not able to put him out him&s;elf. James was in every thing the very rever&s;e of his new companion. He was a mode&s;t, indu&s;trious, pious youth; and though &s;o poor, and the child of a labourer, was a much better &s;choler than Jack, who was a wealthy farmer's &s;on. His father, had it is true, been able to give him but very little &s;chooling, for he was obliged to be put to work when quite a child. When ve|ry young he u&s;ed to run of errands for Mr. Thomas, the curate of the par|i&s;h; a very kind hearted young gentle|man, who boarded next door to his father's cottage. He u&s;ed al&s;o to rub down and &s;addle his hor&s;e, and do any other little job for him, in the mo&s;t civil obliging manner. All this &s;o recom|mended him to the clergyman, that he would often &s;end for him of an evening, after he had done his day's work in the field, and conde&s;cended to teach him him|&s;elf to write and ca&s;t accounts, as well as to in&s;truct him in the principles of his religion. It was not merely out of kindne&s;s for the little good-natured &s;er|ervices
<PB N="10" REF="037145_0009_100C94FC8155A8D8">
James did him, that he &s;hewed him this favour, but al&s;o for his readi|ne&s;s in the catechi&s;m and his devout behaviour at church.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing that drew the mini&s;|&s;ter's attention to this boy, was the fol|lowing:&mdash;He had frequently given him halfpence and pence for holding his hor&s;e and carrying him to water, before he was big enough to be further u&s;eful to him. On Chri&s;tmas Day he was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee James at Church, reading out of a hand&s;ome new prayer book; he wondered how he came by it, for he knew there was nobody in the pari&s;h likely to have given it to him, for at that time there were no Sunday &s;chools; and the father could not afford it, he was &s;ure.</P>
<P>"Well James, &s;aid he, as he &s;aw him when they came out, "you made a good figure at church to day; it made you look like a man and a chri&s;tian, not on|ly to have &s;o hand&s;ome a book, but to be &s;o ready in all parts of the &s;ervice. How
<PB N="11" REF="037145_0010_100C94FE8E26CD80">
came you by that book?" James owned mode&s;tly, that he had been a whole year &s;aving up the money by &s;ingle halfpence, all of which had been of the mini&s;ter's own giving, and in all that time he had not &s;pent a &s;ingle farthing on his own diver&s;ions. "My dear boy," &s;aid good Mr. Thomas, "I am much mi&s;taken if thou do&s;t not turn out well in the world, for two rea&s;ons:&mdash;fir&s;t, from thy &s;aving turn and &s;elf denying temper; and next, becau&s;e thou did<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> devote the fir&s;t eighteen pence thou wa&s;t ever worth in the world to &s;o good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> purpo&s;e."</P>
<P>James bowed and blu&s;hed, and from that time Mr. Thomas began to take more notice of him, and to in&s;truct him as I &s;aid above. As James &s;oon grew a|ble to do him more con&s;iderable &s;ervice, he would now and then give him &s;ix|pence. This he con&s;tantly &s;aved till it became a little &s;um, with which he bought &s;hoes and &s;tockings; well know|ing that his poor father, with a hard family and low wages; could not buy them for him. As to what little money
<PB N="12" REF="037145_0011_100C9501332546E8">
he earned him&s;elf by his daily labour in the field, he con&s;tantly carried it to his mother every Saturday night, to buy bread for the family, which was a pretty help to them.</P>
<P>As James was not very &s;tout in his make, his father thankfully accepted the offer of the pari&s;h officers to bind out his &s;on to a trade. This good man, howev|er, had not like Farmer Brown, the li|berty of chu&s;ing a ma&s;ter for his &s;on, or he would carefully have enquired if he was a proper man to have the care of youth; but Williams the &s;hoemaker was already fixed on, by tho&s;e who were to put the boy out and if he wanted a ma&s;ter it mu&s;t be him or none, for the over&s;eers had a better opinion of Williams than he de&s;erved, and thought it would be the making of the boy to go to him. The father knew that beggars mu&s;t not be choo&s;ers, &s;o he fitted out James for his new place, having indeed little to give him be&s;ides his ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="037145_0012_100C950323113410">
The worthy Mr. Thomas, however, kindly gave him an old coat and wai&s;t|coat, which his mother, who was a neat and notable woman, contrived to make up for him her&s;elf without a farthing ex|pence, and when it was turned and made fit for his &s;ize, it made him a very hand&s;ome &s;uit for Sundays, and la&s;ted him a couple of years.</P>
<P>And here let me &s;top to remark what a pity it is, that poor women &s;o &s;eldom are able or willing to do the&s;e &s;ort of little handy jobs them&s;elves; and that they do not oftener bring up their daughters to be more u&s;eful in family work. They are great lo&s;ers by it e|very way; not only as they are di&s;|qualifying their girls from making good wives hereafter, but they are lo&s;ers in point of pre&s;ent advantage: for gentle-folks could much oftener afford to give a poor boy a jacket or a wai&s;tcoat, if it was not for the expence of making it
<PB N="14" REF="037145_0013_100C9504ADC26AA0">
which adds very much to the co&s;t. To my certain knowledge, many poor wo|men would, often get an old coat, or bit of coar&s;e new cloth given them to fit out a boy, if the mothers or &s;i&s;ters were known to be able to cut it out to advan|tage, and to make it decently them&s;elves. But half a crown for the making a bit of ker&s;ey, which co&s;ts but a few &s;hillings, is more than many very charitable gen|try can afford to give&mdash;&s;o they often give nothing at all when they &s;ee the mothers &s;o little able to turn it to advan|tage. It is hoped they will take this hint kindly, as it is meant for their good.</P>
<P>But to return to our two young &s;hoe|makers. They were both now &s;ettled at Mr. Williams's, who, as he was known to be a good workman, had plen|ty of bu&s;ine&s;s. He had &s;ometimes two or three journeymen but no apprentices but Jack and James.</P>
<P>Jack, who, with all his faults, was a keen, &s;mart boy, took to learn the trade
<PB N="15" REF="037145_0014_100C9506A667E8C0">
quick enough, but the difficulty was to make him &s;tick two hours together at his work. At every noi&s;e he heard in the &s;treet, down went the work&mdash;the la&s;t one way, the upper leather another: the &s;ole dropped on the ground, and the thread he dragged after him, all the way up the &s;treet. If a blind fiddler, a ballad &s;inger, a mountebank, a dancing bear, or a drum, were heard at a di&s;tance&mdash;out ran Jack&mdash;nothing could &s;top him, and not a &s;titch more could he be pre|vailed on to do that day. Every day, every promi&s;e was forgot for the pre&s;ent plea&s;ure&mdash;he could not re&s;i&s;t the &s;malle&s;t temptation&mdash;he never &s;topped a mo|ment to con&s;ider whether a thing was right or wrong, but whether he liked it or di&s;liked it. And as his ill-judging mother took care to &s;end him privately a good &s;upply of pocket-money, that deadly bane to all youthful virtue, he had generally a few pence ready to &s;pend, and to indulge in the pre&s;ent di|ver&s;ion whatever it was. And what was &s;till wor&s;e than even &s;pending his mo|ney, he &s;pent his time too, or rather his
<PB N="16" REF="037145_0015_100C9509324D4220">
ma&s;ters time. Of this he was continu|ally reminded by James, to whom he always an&s;wered, <Q>What have you to complain about? It is nothing to you or any one el&s;e; I &s;pend nobody's money but my own</Q> That may be, re|plied the other, but you cannot &s;ay it is your own <HI>time</HI> that you &s;pend. He in|&s;i&s;ted upon it that it was; but James fetched down their <HI>indentures,</HI> and there &s;hewed him that he had &s;olemnly bound him&s;elf by that in&s;trument, not to wa&s;te his ma&s;ter's property. "Now," quoth James, <HI><Q>thy own time is a very valuable part of thy master's property.</Q></HI> To this he replied, <Q>Every ones time was his own, and he &s;hould not &s;it moping all day over his la&s;t&mdash;for his part, he thanked GOD, <HI>he was</HI> no <HI>parish 'pren|tice.</HI></Q></P>
<P>James did not re&s;ent this piece of fool|i&s;h impertinence, as &s;ome &s;illy lads would have done; nor fly out into a vi|olent pa&s;&s;ion: for even at this early age, he had begun to learn of him <HI>who was meek and lowly of heart;</HI> and therefore
<PB N="17" REF="037145_0016_100C950B2134AFC8">
<HI>when he was reviled, he reviled not again.</HI> On the contrary he was &s;o very kind and gentle, that even Jack, vain and Idle as he was, could not help loving him, though he took care never to follow his advice.</P>
<P>Jack's fondne&s;s for his boyi&s;h and &s;il|ly diver&s;ions in the &s;treet, &s;oon produ|ced the effects which might naturally be expected; and the &s;ame idlene&s;s which led him to fly out into the town at the &s;ound of a fiddle, or the &s;ight of a pup|pet &s;how, &s;oon led him to tho&s;e places where all the&s;e fiddles and &s;hows natu|rally lead, I mean the ALEHOUSE. The acquaintance picked up in the &s;treet was carried on at the Greyhound; and the idle pa&s;times of the boy &s;oon led to the de&s;tructive vices of the man.</P>
<P>As he was not an ill-tempered youth, nor naturally much given to drink; a &s;ober and prudent ma&s;ter, who had been &s;teady in his management, and regular in his own conduct; who had recom|mended good advice by a good example,
<PB N="18" REF="037145_0017_100C950CAE5F4AC8">
might have made &s;omething of Jack. But I am &s;orry to &s;ay, that Mr. Wil|liams, though a good workman, and not a very hard or &s;evere ma&s;ter, was neither a &s;ober nor a &s;teady man&mdash;&s;o far from it, that he &s;pent much more time at the Greyhound, than at home. There was no order either in his &s;hop or family. He left the chief care of the bu&s;ine&s;s to his two young apprentices; and being but a worldly man, he was at fir&s;t di&s;po|&s;ed to &s;hew favour to Jack much more than to James, becau&s;e he had more mo|ney, and his father was better in the world than the father of poor James.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t, therefore, he was di&s;po&s;ed to con&s;ider James as a &s;ort of drudge, who was to do all the menial work of the family, and he did not care how little he taught him of his trade. With Mrs. Williams the matter was &s;till wor&s;e; &s;he con&s;tantly called him away from the bu&s;ine&s;s of his trade to wa&s;h the hou&s;e, nur&s;e the child, turn the &s;pit, or run of errands. And here I mu&s;t remark, that though pari&s;h apprentices are bound in
<PB N="19" REF="037145_0018_100C950E41674890">
duty to be &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive both to ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s, and always to make them|&s;elves as u&s;eful as they can in a family, and to be civil and humble; yet on the other hand it is the duty of ma&s;ters al|ways to remember, that if they are paid for in&s;tructing them in their trade, they ought con&s;cientiou&s;ly to in&s;truct them in it, and not to employ them the grea|ter part of their time in &s;uch hou&s;ehold or other drudgery, as to deprive them of the opportunity of acquiring their trade.</P>
<P>Mr. Williams &s;oon found out that his favourite Jack would be of little u&s;e to him in the &s;hop: for though he worked well enough, he did not care how little he did. Nor could he be of the lea&s;t u&s;e to his ma&s;ter in keeping an account, or writing out a bill upon occa&s;ion, for, as he never could be made to learn to cypher, he did not know addition from multiplication.</P>
<P>One day one of the cu&s;tomers called at the &s;hop in a great hurry, and de|&s;ired
<PB N="20" REF="037145_0019_100C9510B933AD40">
his bill might be made out that minute: Mr. Williams, having taken a cup too much, made &s;everal attempts to put down a clear account, but the more he tried, the le&s;s he found him&s;elf able to do it. James, who was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">itting at his la&s;t, ro&s;e up, and with great mo|de&s;ty, a&s;ked his ma&s;ter if he would plea&s;e to give him leave to make out the bill, &s;aying that, though but a poor &s;cholar, he would do his be&s;t, rather than keep the gentleman waiting. Wil|liams gladly accepted his offer, and con|fu&s;ed as his head was with liquor, he was yet able to ob&s;erve with what neat|ne&s;s, di&s;patch, and exactne&s;s, the ac|count was drawn out. From that time he no longer con&s;idered James as a drudge, but as one fitted for the higher employ|ments of the trade, and he was now regularly employed to manage the ac|counts, with which all the cu&s;tomers were &s;o well plea&s;ed, that it contributed greatly to rai&s;e him in his ma&s;ter's e&s;|teem; for there were now never any of tho&s;e blunders, or fal&s;e charges, for
<PB N="21" REF="037145_0020_100C9512ACB8D270">
which the &s;hop had before been &s;o famous.</P>
<P>James went on in a regular cour&s;e of indu&s;try, and &s;oon became the be&s;t workman Mr. Williams had, but there were many things in the family which he greatly di&s;approved. Some of the journeymen u&s;ed to &s;wear, drink, and &s;ing very licentious &s;ongs. All the&s;e things were a great grief to his &s;ober mind; he complained to his ma&s;ter, who only laughed at him: and indeed, as Williams did the &s;ame him&s;elf, he put it out of his own power to correct his &s;ervants, if he had been &s;o di&s;po&s;ed. James, however, u&s;ed always to reprove them with great mildne&s;s indeed, but with great &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s al&s;o. This, but &s;till more his own excellent example, produced at length very good effects on &s;uch of the men as were not quite har|dened in &s;in.</P>
<P>What grieved him mo&s;t was the man|ner in which the Sunday was &s;pent. The ma&s;ter lay in bed all the morning,
<PB N="22" REF="037145_0021_100C9514A90338C8">
nor did the mother or her children ever go to church, except there was &s;ome new finery to be &s;hewn, or a chri&s;tening to be attended. The town's people were coming to the &s;hop all the morn|ing, for work which &s;hould have been &s;ent home the night before, had not the ma&s;ter been at the alehou&s;e. And what wounded James to the very &s;oul was, that the ma&s;ter expected the two apprentices to carry home &s;hoes to the country cu&s;tomers on the Sunday morn|ing: which he wickedly thought was a &s;aving of time, as it prevented their hin|dering their work on the Saturday. The&s;e &s;hameful practices greatly afflicted poor James; he begged his ma&s;ter, with tears in his eyes, to excu&s;e him, but he only laughed at his &s;queami&s;h con&s;ci|ence, as he called it.</P>
<P>Jack did not di&s;like this part of the bu&s;ine&s;s, and generally after he had de|livered his parcel, wa&s;ted good part of the day in nutting, playing at fives, or dropping in at the public hou&s;e: any thing was better than going to church.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="037145_0022_100C95169C578228">
James, on the other-hand, when he was compelled, &s;orely again&s;t his con|&s;cience, to carry home any goods on a Sunday morning, always got up as &s;oon as it was light, knelt down and prayed&punc; heartily to GOD to forgive him a &s;in&punc; which it was not in his power to avoid; he took care not to lo&s;e a moment by the way, but as he was taking his walk with the utmo&s;t &s;peed, to leave his &s;hoes with the cu&s;tomers, he &s;pent his time in endeavouring to keep up good thoughts in his mind, and praying that the day might come when his con&s;cience might be delivered from this grievous burthen. He was now particularly thankful, that Mr. Thomas had former|ly taught him &s;o many p&s;alms and chap|ters which he u&s;ed to repeat in the&s;e walks with great devotion.</P>
<P>He always got home before the re&s;t of the family were up, dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf very clean and went twice to church; and as he greatly di&s;liked the company and practices of his ma&s;ter's hou&s;e, particu|larly on the Sabbath-day, he preferred
<PB N="24" REF="037145_0023_100C95192FEE8200">
&s;pending his evening alone, reading his Bible, which I forgot to &s;ay the worthy clergyman had given him when he left his native village. Sunday evening, which is to &s;ome people &s;uch a burthen, was to James the highe&s;t holiday. He had formerly learnt a little how to &s;ing a p&s;alm of the clerk of his own pari&s;h, and this was now become a very de|lightful part of his evening exerci&s;e. And as one of the journeymen; by James's advice and example, was now beginning to be of a more &s;erious way of thinking, he often a&s;ked him to &s;it an hour with him, when they read the Bible and talked it over together in a manner very plea&s;ant and improving; and as this man was a famous &s;inger, a p&s;alm or two &s;ung together, was a very inno|cent plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>James's good manners and civility to the cu&s;tomers, drew much bu&s;ine&s;s to the &s;hop, and his &s;kill as a workman was &s;o great, that every per&s;on de&s;ired his &s;hoes might be made by James. Williams grew &s;o very idle and negli|gent,
<PB N="25" REF="037145_0024_100C951B44411898">
that he now totally neglected his affairs, and to hard drinking added deep gaming. All James's care, both of the &s;hop and the accounts, could not keep things in any tolerable order: he repre&s;ented to his ma&s;ter that they were growing wor&s;e and wor&s;e; and exhorted him, if he valued his credit as a trade&s;man, his comfort as a hu&s;|band and father, his character as a ma&s;ter, and his &s;oul as a chri&s;tian, to turn over a new leaf. Williams &s;wore a great oath, that he would not be re&s;trained in his plea&s;ures to plea&s;e a canting pari&s;h 'prentice, nor to humour a parcel of &s;qualling brats&mdash;that let people &s;ay what they would of him, they &s;hould ne|ver &s;ay he was a hypocrite, and as long as they could not call him that, he did not care what el&s;e they called him.</P>
<P>In a violent pa&s;&s;ion he immediately went to the Greyhound, where he now &s;pent, not only every evening, which he had long done, but good part of the day and night al&s;o. His wife was very dre&s;&s;y, extravagant, and fond of compa|ny;
<PB N="26" REF="037145_0025_100C951CD0729A10">
and &s;pent at home as fa&s;t as her hu&s;band did abroad; &s;o that all the neighbours &s;aid, if it had not been for James, his ma&s;ter mu&s;t have broke long ago, but they were &s;ure he could not hold it much longer.</P>
<P>As Jack Brown &s;ung a good &s;ong, and played many diverting tricks, Wil|liams liked his company, and often al|lowed him to make one at the Grey|hound, where he would laugh heartily at his &s;tories; &s;o that every one thought Jack was much the greater favourite&mdash;&s;o he was a companion in frolick, and foolery, and <HI>pleasure,</HI> as it is called; but he would not tru&s;t him with an inch of leather of &s;ixpence in money: No, no&mdash;when bu&s;ine&s;s was to be done, or tru&s;t was to be repo&s;ed, James was the man: the idle and the drunken never tru&s;t one another, if they have common &s;en&s;e. They like to laugh, and &s;ing, and riot, and drink together; but when they want a friend, a help in bu&s;ine&s;s or in trouble, they go farther a field; and Williams, while he would drink with
<PB N="27" REF="037145_0026_100C838EC4BDE1E8">
Jack, would tru&s;t James with untold gold, and even was fooli&s;hly tempted to neglect his bu&s;ine&s;s the more from knowing that he had one at home who was taking care of it.</P>
<P>In &s;pite of all Jame's care and dili|gence, however, things were growing wor&s;e and wor&s;e: the more James &s;av|ed the more the ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s &s;pent. One morning, ju&s;t as the &s;hop was opened, and James had &s;et every body to their re&s;pective work, and he him&s;elf was &s;ettling the bu&s;ine&s;s for the day, he found that his ma&s;ter was not yet come from the Greyhound. As this was now become a common ca&s;e, he only grieved but did not wonder at it. Whil&s;t he was indulging &s;ad thoughts on what would be the end of all this, in ran the tap&s;ter from the Greyhound out of breath, and with a look of terror and di&s;may, de&s;ired James would &s;tep o|ver to the public-hou&s;e with him that moment, for that his ma&s;ter wanted him.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="037145_0027_100C951EF70C7FB0">
James went immediately, &s;urpri&s;ed at this unu&s;ual me&s;&s;age. When he got into the kitchen of the public-hou&s;e, which he now entered for the fir&s;t time in his life, though it was oppo&s;ite the hou&s;e in which he lived, he was &s;hocked at the bea&s;tly di&s;gu&s;ting appearance of every thing he beheld. There was a table covered with tankards, punch|bowls, broken gla&s;&s;es, pipes, and dirty grea&s;y packs of cards, and all over wet with liquor; the floor was &s;trewed with broken earthen cups, odd cards, and an EO table &s;hivered to pieces in a quarrel; behind the table &s;tood a crowd of dirty fellows, with matted locks, hollow eyes, and faces &s;meared with tobacco; James made his way after the tap&s;ter, through this wretched looking crew, to a &s;ettle which &s;tood in the chimney corner. Not a word was uttered, but the &s;ilent horror &s;eemed to denote &s;omething more than a mere common drinking bout.</P>
<P>What was the di&s;may of James, when he &s;aw his mi&s;erable ma&s;ter &s;tretched out on the &s;ettle, in all the agonies of
<PB N="29" REF="037145_0028_100C9521DE24E370">
death. He had fallen into a &s;it, after having drank hard be&s;t part of the night, and &s;eemed to have but a few minutes to live. In his frightful countenance was di&s;played the dreadful picture of &s;in and death: for he &s;truggled at once un|der the guilt of intoxication, and the pangs of a dying man. He recovered his &s;en&s;es for a few moments, and called out to a&s;k if his faithful &s;ervant was come: James went up to him, took him by his cold hand, but was too much mo|ved to &s;peak. "Oh! James, James;" cried he in a broken voice, "pray for me, comfort me." James &s;poke kindly to him, but was too hone&s;t to give him fal&s;e comfort, as is too often done by mi&s;taken friends in the&s;e dreadful mo|ments.</P>
<P>"James," &s;aid he, <Q>I have been a bad ma&s;ter to you&mdash;you would have &s;aved me, &s;oul and body, but I would not let you&mdash;I have ruined my wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, my children, and my own &s;oul. Take warning, oh, take warning by my mi&s;erable end,</Q> &s;aid he to
<PB N="30" REF="037145_0029_100C95236C7583F8">
his &s;tupified companions; but none were able to attend him but James, who bid him lift up his heart to GOD, and prayed heartily for him him&s;elf. "Oh!" &s;aid the dying man, <Q>it is too late, too late for me&mdash;but you have &s;till time,</Q> &s;aid he to the half-drunken terrified crew around him. "Where is Jack?" Jack Brown came forward, but was too much frightened to &s;peak. <Q>O wretch|ed boy,</Q> &s;aid he, <Q>I fear I &s;hall have the ruin of thy &s;oul, as well as my own, to an&s;wer for, Stop &s;hort!&mdash;Take warning&mdash;now, in the days of thy youth.</Q> <Q>O James, James, thou do&s;t not pray for me. Death is dread|ful to the wicked. O the &s;ting of death to a guilty con&s;cience!</Q> Here he lifted up his gha&s;tly eyes in &s;peechle&s;s horror, gra&s;ped hard the hand of James, gave a deep hollow groan, and clo&s;ed his eyes never to open them but in awful eternity.</P>
<P>This was death in all it's horrors! The gay companions of his &s;inful plea|&s;ures could not &s;tand the &s;ight; all &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">unk
<PB N="31" REF="037145_0030_100C838D111926C8">
away like guilty thieves from the late favourite friend&mdash;no one was left to A&s;&s;i&s;t him but his two apprentices. Brown was not &s;o hardened but that he &s;hed ma|ny tears for his unhappy ma&s;ter; and even made &s;ome ha&s;ty re&s;olutions of a|mendment, which were too &s;oon forgot|ten.</P>
<P>While Brown &s;tepped home to call the workmen to come and a&s;&s;i&s;t in remo|ving their poor ma&s;ter, James &s;taid alone with the corp&s;e, and employed tho&s;e awful moments in indulging the mo&s;t &s;erious thoughts, and prayed heartily to GOD, that &s;o terrible a le&s;&s;on might not be thrown away upon him; but that he might be enabled to live in a con&s;tant &s;tate of preparation for death.&mdash;The re|&s;olutions he made at this moment, as they were not made in his own &s;trength, but in an humble reliance on GOD'S gracious help, were of u&s;e to him as long as he lived; and if ever he was for a moment tempted to &s;ay, or do a wrong thing, the remembrance of his poor dy|ing ma&s;ter's la&s;t agonies, and the dread|ful
<PB N="32" REF="037145_0031_100C9526F10316B0">
words he uttered, always in&s;tantly checked him.</P>
<P>When Williams was buried, and his affairs came to be enquired into, they were found to be in a &s;ad condition. His wife, indeed, was the le&s;s to be piti|ed, as &s;he had contributed her full &s;hare to their common ruin. James, however, did pity her, and by his &s;kill in accounts, his known hone&s;ty, and the tru&s;t the creditors put in his word, things came to be &s;ettled rather better than Mrs. Williams expected.</P>
<P>Both Brown and James were now within a month or two of being out of their time. The creditors, as was &s;aid before, employed James to &s;ettle his late ma&s;ter's accounts, which he did in a manner &s;o creditable to his abilities, and his hone&s;ty, that they propo&s;ed to him to take the &s;hop him&s;elf. He a&s;&s;ured them it was utterly out of his power for want of money. As the creditors had not the lea&s;t fear of being repaid, if it &s;hould plea&s;e GOD to &s;pare his life, they generou&s;|ly
<PB N="33" REF="037145_0032_100C9529EA4B50F8">
agreed among them&s;elves, to advance him a &s;um of money without any &s;ecuri|ty but his bond; for this he was to pay a very moderate intere&s;t, and to return the whole in a certain number of years James &s;hed tears of gratitude at this te&s;timony to his character, and could hardly be prevailed on to accept their kindne&s;s, &s;o great was his dread of being in debt.</P>
<P>He took the remainder of the lea&s;e from his mi&s;tre&s;s and in &s;ettling affairs with her, took care to make every thing as advantageous to her as po&s;&s;ible. He never once allowed him&s;elf to think how unkind &s;he had been to him, he only &s;aw in her the needy widow of his decea&s;ed ma&s;ter, and the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed mother of an infant family; and was heartily &s;orry it was not in his power to contri|bute to their &s;upport, for it was not on|ly his duty, but his delight to return good for evil; for he was a CHRISTIAN.</P>
<P>James Stock was now, by the ble&s;&s;ing of GOD on his own earne&s;t endeavours,
<PB N="34" REF="037145_0033_100C952BE050EB30">
ma&s;ter of a con&s;iderable &s;hop, and was re&s;pected by the whole town for his prudence, hone&s;ty, and piety. We will now proceed to &s;hew how he behaved in his new &s;tation, and al&s;o what befel his comrade Brown.</P>
<P>In the mean time, other apprentices will do well to follow &s;o prai&s;e worthy an example, and to remember, that the re&s;pectable ma&s;ter of a large &s;hop, and a profitable bu&s;ine&s;s, was rai&s;ed to that creditable &s;ituation, without money, friends, or connections, from the low beginning of a <HI>parish 'prentice by &s;obri|ety,</HI> indu&s;try, <HI>the fear of God,</HI> and an obedience to the divine principles of the CHRISTIAN RELIGION.</P>
<P>This &s;udden pro&s;perity was a time of trial to poor James; who, as he was now become a creditable trade&s;man, I &s;hall hereafter think proper to call Mr. James Stock. I &s;ay, this &s;udden ri&s;e in life was a time of trial; for we hardly know what we are our&s;elves till we be|come our own ma&s;ters. There is in|deed
<PB N="35" REF="037145_0034_100C952D6B8F5630">
always a rea&s;onable hope that a good &s;ervant will not make a bad ma&s;ter, and that a faithful apprentice will prove an hone&s;t trade&s;man. But the heart of man is deceitful; and &s;ome folks who &s;eem to behave very well while they are under &s;ubjection, no &s;ooner get a little power than their heads are turned, and they grow prouder than tho&s;e who are gentlemen born. They forget at once that they were lately poor and depen|dent them&s;elves, &s;o that one would think that with their poverty they had lo&s;t their memory too. I have known &s;ome who had &s;uffered mo&s;t hard&s;hips in their early days, become the mo&s;t hard and oppre&s;&s;ive in their turn; &s;o that they &s;eem to forget that fine con&s;iderate rea|&s;on which God gives to the children of I&s;rael why they &s;hould be merciful to their &s;ervants, "remembering" &s;aith he, "that thou thy&s;elf wa&s;t a bondman."</P>
<P>Young Mr. Stock did not &s;o forget him&s;elf. He had indeed the only &s;ure guard from falling into this error. It was not from any ea&s;ine&s;s in his natural
<PB N="36" REF="037145_0035_100C952F448D6F90">
di&s;po&s;ition: for that only ju&s;t &s;erves to make folks good natured when they are plea&s;ed, and patient when they have nothing to vex them. James went up|on higher ground. He did not give way to abu&s;ive language, becau&s;e he knew it was a &s;in. He did not u&s;e his appren|tices ill; becau&s;e he knew he had him|&s;elf a ma&s;ter in heaven.</P>
