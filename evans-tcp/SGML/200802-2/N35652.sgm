<HEAD>QUESTION I.</HEAD>
<P>What rai&s;es your admiration, when grace is in exerci&s;e in your &s;oul?</P>
<P>ANS. GREAT is the mi&s;tery of godli|ne&s;s! My admiration often ri&s;es beyond expre&s;&s;ion. But I will try to expre&s;s &s;ome of my ideas as well as I can. I greatly admire I &s;hould be made to hear and know the joyful &s;ound! I, that was far off! I, that was an enemy to <HI>King</HI> JE|SUS! I, that was by nature a child of wrath even as others! Why was it I that was ta|ken, while others are left! I can't re&s;olve this mi&s;tery; it &s;till remains a wonder! I mu&s;t leave it with thank&s;giving in the hands of GOD, as my ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Savior</HI> did, &s;aying, <HI>Even &s;o,</HI> Father, <HI>for &s;o it &s;eemed good in thy fight.</HI></P>
<P>BUT that which rai&s;es my admiration the highe&s;t is, the way that mercy reaches &s;in|ners; that GOD &s;hould be manife&s;t in the fle&s;h: That the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Heaven</HI> &s;hould die
<PB N="4" REF="046575_0004_10219C3C9216EBA0">
for his rebellious &s;ubjects! That the <HI>Crea|tor</HI> &s;hould bear the puni&s;hment due to his poor, &s;inful creatures! O this is a&s;toni&s;h|ing love and conde&s;cen&s;ion! I wonder and admire! O this excellent way of redemp|tion! The love of GOD pa&s;&s;es all under|&s;tanding. I can &s;ee and know but little of the love of GOD that pa&s;&s;es knowledge: But what I &s;ee thereof looks very wonder|ful: Yet I wonder at my own &s;tupidity, that I am &s;o little affected with this won|derful love of GOD. Why don't my ad|miration ri&s;e va&s;tly higher than ever it did yet? I wonder that my tho'ts are &s;o flat and low, while I hope I am redeemed from eter|nal death by the precious blood of CHRIST.</P>
<LG>
<L>Amazing love! Unbounded grace!</L>
<L>How bright it &s;hines in JESUS' face!</L>
<L>Where ju&s;tice &s;tern, and mercy free</L>
<L>To &s;ave poor &s;inners do agree.</L>

<HEAD>QU. II. What is your &s;orrow and mourning?</HEAD>
<P>ANS. I Mourn that I have &s;inned, and am &s;till a &s;inner again&s;t the LORD of GLORY: That I am &s;o unlike to CHRIST: That when I would do good evil is pre&s;ent with me: That my heart is &s;o evil, &s;o vain and &s;o &s;tupid, and that I can do no more &s;ervice for GOD and his children. It cau&s;es &s;orrow and mourning when I &s;ee that my &s;ins have pierced the <HI>Son</HI> of
<PB N="5" REF="046575_0005_1021986D88F4C920">
GOD. O this is a &s;orrowful &s;ight! What have I done? Did my &s;ins torment the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Glory?</HI> I can't but mourn to think of this; and that any of my &s;ins, the murderers that wounded the heart of JESUS, &s;hould be entertained in my heart.&mdash;I mourn for the precious &s;ons and daughters of <HI>Zion,</HI> when I &s;ee them mourning under various trou|bles; their &s;orrow is my &s;orrow. I mourn to &s;ee the cau&s;e of GOD wounded at any time by any of its profe&s;&s;ed friends; and to &s;ee many going on to all appearance in the broad way that leads to de&s;truction, &s;lighting the blood of the <HI>Lamb</HI> of GOD. Grace teaches me to mourn for &s;in wherever I &s;ee it, whe|ther in my&s;elf or others.</P>
<LG>
<L>My &s;orrows here are manifold,</L>
<L>Which cannot be in order told:</L>
<L>But &s;oon I hope thro' grace to &s;ee</L>
<L>The end of all that troubles me.</L>
</LG>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="question">
<HEAD>QUES. III What is your joy and rejoicing?</HEAD>
<P>ANS. I Rejoice in the LORD, and joy in him who is the rock of my &s;alvation. I rejoice in what the LORD hath done. He hath made me glad thro' his work, and I will tri|umph in the work of his hands. When I have a view of the glorious perfections of GOD, I give thanks at the remembrance of his holine&s;s. Tho' I am a mourning &s;inner, yet I rejoice that
<PB N="6" REF="046575_0006_10219C3EB0942C28">
the LORD makes me mourn, and that he hath promi&s;ed comfort to tho&s;e that mourn: Thus I &s;ee he gives grace for grace. I rejoice in hope of the glory of GOD, and of the fulfilment of all the exceeding great and precious pro|mi&s;es which will be the perfection of holine&s;s, the de&s;truction of &s;in, the end of all &s;orrow and the perfection of all joy. I rejoice to &s;ee and hear of &s;ubjects being born to <HI>King</HI> JESUS: I love to hear them &s;peaking <HI>Canaan's</HI> &s;weet lan|guage, and their joy is my joy. Grace teaches me to rejoice in the LORD's work wherever I &s;ee it, and to rejoice in nothing but what is the LORD's. What&s;oever the King does plea|&s;es all the people that are governed by his grace. My various joys are too numerous to reckon up in order, and I expect they will ne|ver end, but increa&s;e and endure forever. My joys are now but ju&s;t budded; the be|gining is &s;mall, but the latter end &s;hall greatly increa&s;e. Some drops of joy have now entered into my &s;oul; but I hope &s;oon to enter into the joy of my LORD.</P>
<LG>
<L>Glory to GOD for all my joy,</L>
<L>O may his prai&s;e my tongue employ!</L>
<L>Now whil&s;t I live, and when I die,</L>
<L>And to a long eternity.</L>
</LG>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="question">
<HEAD>QUES. IV. What do you hate?</HEAD>
<P>ANS. I Hate &s;in; e&s;pecially the &s;ins of my own heart: The pride, unbelief and
<PB N="7" REF="046575_0007_10219C5B94E71EB8">
vanity that lurks within are my hateful ene|mies. There is nothing &s;o hateful as &s;in, whether it &s;hews it&s;elf in thought, word or deed. The grace of GOD teaches me to hate what&s;oever the LORD hates.</P>
<LG>
<L>I hate the vanity and &s;in,</L>
<L>The fooli&s;h thoughts that lurk within,</L>
<L>And often lead my &s;oul a&s;tray</L>
<L>From JESUS CHRIST my holy way.</L>
</LG>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="question">
<HEAD>QUESTION V. What do you love?</HEAD>
<P>ANSWER. GRACE teaches me to love what&s;oever is like the altogether lovely JESUS; he is the centre of love. GOD is love, and to him all true love will fly. The <HI>Father, Son</HI> and <HI>Holy Gho&s;t</HI> make one e&s;&s;ential GOD of love, manife&s;ted to us in a mo&s;t familiar, conde&s;cending man|ner by the <HI>Son</HI> of GOD, who became the &s;on of man, that we might become the children of GOD. O glorious beauty! E&s;&s;ential love! How &s;hould my heart forever burn with love to this lovely <HI>One!</HI> Well may it be &s;aid, <HI>He is altogether lovely:</HI> The full perfection of all that is excellent &s;hines in his lovely face. How &s;weet are all his commands! They are a perfect law of liberty, and are very lovely to me. For JESUS' &s;ake I love my fellow crea|tures, though I hate the ways of &s;inners. But I
<PB N="8" REF="046575_0008_10219C40D2DCF6D8">
have a &s;pecial love to the Saints, the excellent, in whom I take delight. They are more love|ly than others, becau&s;e they have received a mea&s;ure of the lovely Spirit of GOD. They re|&s;emble the <HI>King</HI> in &s;ome mea&s;ure: They can talk his language, and the more they are like him the more lovely they are. We ought to love one another as JESUS has loved us, and yet love the LORD our GOD with all our heart, &s;oul, mind and &s;trength. All my love to creatures &s;hould be for his &s;ake, from whom all loveline&s;s proceeds; &s;o that let me love whom or what I will, &s;till all my love &s;hould be &s;et upon GOD. I &s;ee here is a &s;weet mi&s;tery and loving harmony, which looks very beautiful and lovely to me.</P>
<LG>
<L>All glory to the GOD of love,</L>
<L>Who&s;e love de&s;cendeth from above!</L>
<L>And then a&s;cendeth up again,</L>
<L>Where love forever will remain.</L>
</LG>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="question">
<HEAD>QUESTION VI. What are your fears?</HEAD>
<P>ANS. PErfect love ca&s;teth out fear: But &s;till the fear of the LORD is the begining of wi&s;dom. I am &s;ubject to many fears thro' imperfection, and for want of more love; which fears cau&s;e a degree of torment. When love grows cold I fear I &s;hall at la&s;t pe|ri&s;h by my enemies, and that I do not belong to the family of CHRIST; that I do not love
<PB N="9" REF="046575_0009_10219C5DAE492AB8">
him nor his children as true-hearted Chri&s;ti|ans do; that all my love is &s;elf-love, and that I &s;hall at la&s;t be forever &s;eparated from CHRIST and the Saints, &amp;c. I al&s;o fear the faces of mor|tals. And many outward dangers cau&s;e fears: Without are fightings, and within are fears. But all the&s;e fears, and many more of the &s;ame nature, cannot &s;tand before the love of JESUS. The&s;e are the fears that perfect love will ca&s;t out; and the true fear of the LORD will bani&s;h them from the &s;oul. Grace teaches me only to fear the LORD, with a plea&s;ant loving fear: Fearing to &s;in again&s;t GOD, or to break the lea&s;t of his commandments. The true fear of the LORD is in &s;weet agreement with love, and there is no torment therein.</P>
<LG>
<L><HI>O may I always fear the LORD,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And love and keep his holy Word!</HI></L>
<L><HI>And never let a mortal's face</HI></L>
<L><HI>Make me afraid to &s;peak his prai&s;e.</HI></L>

</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="7" TYPE="question">
<HEAD>QUEST. VII. What do you hope for?</HEAD>
<P>ANSW. I Hope for un&s;peakable ble&s;&s;ings. I hope that my LORD's kingdom will advance until it fills the whole earth, and my GOD will &s;ubdue all things to him&s;elf, and the loftine&s;s of all fle&s;h will be brought down, and every knee will bow to <HI>King</HI> JESUS, and the LORD alone &s;hall be exalted. When all this
<PB N="10" REF="046575_0010_10219C42EE8A8918">
comes to pa&s;s my hopes will all be accompli&s;h|ed. I hope for compleat deliverance from &s;in, and to be made perfectly holy: Then I hope to &s;ee and know what GOD hath laid up for them that love him.&mdash;Above all I hope that mine eyes &s;hall &s;ee the <HI>King</HI> in his beauty, by who&s;e death I have hopes of eternal life: And when I &s;ee him as he is, I hope I &s;hall be like unto him&punc; and al&s;o &s;ee all his ble&s;&s;ed family toge|ther. O what a glorious company I hope to &s;ee, all looking like the lovely JESUS! I hope for wonderful things which I &s;ee not, and I de|&s;ire with patience to wait for them. CHRIST is my hope; therefore I expect my hope will never make me a&s;hamed. He is in all his children the hope of glory; which hope is as an anchor to the &s;oul, &s;ure and &s;tedfa&s;t. Glory of GOD for my hope: I might as ju&s;tly been in keen de&s;pair, where hope could never come.</P>

<L>CHRIST JESUS <HI>is the only</HI> One</L>

<HEAD>QUEST. VIII. What are your de&s;ires?</HEAD>
<P>ANS. MY de&s;ires are as large and exten&s;ive as my hopes, and are very nu|merous, which cannot all be told; but &s;ome of them I will mention, which may compre|hend them all.&mdash;I de&s;ire all that I hope for.

the earth cannot &s;atisfy me. My &s;oul thir&s;teth for GOD, for the living GOD. I can de&s;ire no|thing greater, and nothing le&s;s can give me &s;atisfaction. O how long mu&s;t I remain at &s;uch a di&s;tance from GOD? How long mu&s;t I remain a &s;inner? I long to be perfectly holy. I never &s;hall be fully &s;atisfied until I awake in the likene&s;s of CHRIST. I greatly de&s;ire to be an in&s;trument u&s;ed in the hands of GOD, to &s;hew forth his prai&s;es; to be a ve&s;&s;el fitted for the ble&s;&s;ed <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI>'s u&s;e and &s;ervice; to know and do his will continually. I de&s;ire to bear much fruit, that thereby the heavenly <HI>Father</HI> may be glorified: And the &s;ame ble&s;&s;ings I de|&s;ire for my own &s;oul I de&s;ire for all the elect of GOD: I want to have them all bro't home to JESUS, and to have all creatures bowing at his feet. I de&s;ire the fulfilment of all the promi&s;es, then all that are excellent and love|ly &s;hall be together, and &s;ing and eternal &s;ong of prai&s;e to GOD and the <HI>Lamb;</HI> and never &s;in, nor never part to endle&s;s ages: Every one ca&s;ting the crown of all their joy, down before him who only is worthy of all the glory. O what a glorious day is at hand when all the de&s;ires that the LORD gives to all his chil|dren &s;hall be more than granted!</P>

<HEAD>QUESTION IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD>What enemies have you to fight again&s;t?</HEAD>
<P>ANS. THere is a large army encamped a|gain&s;t me, who are under three ge|nerals, the world, the fle&s;h and the devil: The&s;e with all their ho&s;t I mu&s;t re&s;i&s;t with &s;piritual weapons; and it will never be law|ful nor prudent for me to yield or flee before the enemy; but as I have li&s;ted in the <HI>King</HI>'s &s;ervice during life, I mu&s;t fight as long as I remain in the enemy's country. My <HI>King</HI> gives all his &s;oldiers a noble bounty and good wa|ges, and &s;ets open a full &s;tore, where there is a plenty of weapons of proof, that never fail when well u&s;ed, of prevailing again&s;t the ene|my: And a full &s;tore of provi&s;ion, food well dre&s;&s;ed for all that are hungry: And raiment plenty, fit to wear in the palace of glory: And his command and promi&s;e is, <HI>Be thou faithful unto the death and I will give thee a crown of life.</HI> The world &s;eeks to ruin my &s;oul, &s;ometimes by flatteries and &s;ometimes by frowns; but I mu&s;t not regard it, but go &s;trait forward toward the heavenly world and never be conformed to this world, but always &s;eek to be transformed by the renewing of my mind, after the image of GOD's dear SON. I mu&s;t not fear them that can kill the body, and do no more. The fle&s;h is a &s;ubtle enemy and
<PB N="13" REF="046575_0013_10219C60BAF22DF0">
pleads hard to be indulged in &s;in: But I mu&s;t make no provi&s;ion for the fle&s;h, to ful|fil the lu&s;ts thereof. The&s;e &s;elfi&s;h enemies do me the mo&s;t damage. The world and &s;a|tan with all their ho&s;t could do me but little hurt, if it was not for a number of deceitful foes within, always ready to let in the ene|my, and to crowd them&s;elves into all my be&s;t company, &s;poiling my meditation and con|ver&s;ation. The devil like a roaring lion goes about &s;eeking whom he may devour; yet every weak lamb is bound to re&s;i&s;t this lion &s;tedfa&s;t in the faith. My enemies compa&s;s me about like bees; an army without, and an army within: They are lively and &s;trong, the weake&s;t of the&s;e enemies are too &s;trong for me. But yet I mu&s;t fight and never yield until they are all overcome. I, that have de&s;troyed my&s;elf, and am weak and faint, and have no &s;trength; I, mu&s;t fight again&s;t an ho&s;t that are &s;et in battle array again&s;t me; and I am commanded not to fear, but to with&s;tand in the evil day, and having done all &s;till I mu&s;t &s;tand.

<HEAD>QUES. X. How can you have any hopes of being an overcomer, &s;eeing you have no &s;trength?</HEAD>
<P>ANSW. THE LORD is my &s;trength and &s;ong: He al&s;o is become my &s;alvation: He giveth power to the faint, and to them that have no might he increa&s;eth &s;trength. Though an ho&s;t encamp again&s;t me, I will not fear; for in the name of the LORD I can de&s;troy them. By my GOD I can run through a troop, and leap over a wall. I can do all things through CHRIST who &s;trengtheneth me. If I can but &s;et the LORD always before my face, I &s;hall not be moved. As long as I tru&s;t in the LORD I know I &s;hall be &s;afe; for his promi&s;es are &s;ure to all that tru&s;t in him.

<P>ANSW. THE glory of GOD &s;hould al|ways be my aim. Whether I eat or drink, or whatever I do, I &s;hould do all to the glory of GOD. This is the mo&s;t noble motive that can be &s;et before me. This I believe is the joyful work of the &s;hin|ing armies in glory, to do all they do to the glory of GOD: Could I attain to this a hap|py creature I &s;hould be. My joyful work &s;hould always be to glorify my <HI>Father</HI> who

is in Heaven. Herein will he be glorified, if I bear much fruit. But my unbelieving heart &s;ays, What fruit can &s;uch a thorn as I am bear? The LORD &s;ays, <HI>I am a green fir-tree; from me is thy fruit found. Abide in me and I in you: As the branch cannot bear fruit of it&s;elf, except it abide in the vine, no more can ye, except ye abide in me."</HI> If I abide in CHRIST and keep his commandments I &s;hall bear good fruit. The fruit of the Spi|rit is exceeding &s;weet and plea&s;ant to the ta&s;te: What is &s;weeter than love, joy and peace? Lovely and plea&s;ant is the work my LORD calls me to do. Why &s;hould my evil heart be backward or unwilling to do the work of Saints and Angels in glory. It will be for my happine&s;s to always be &s;ub|mitted to the will of GOD. I know his will is for the be&s;t; and to con&s;tantly continue in his &s;ervice; I know his &s;ervice is good and ea&s;y: And to ca&s;t all my care upon him. I know he will take better care of me than I can of myself. O that I might be u&s;ed as an in&s;trument for the glory of <HI>Him</HI> who&s;e e&s;&s;en|tial glory can never be increa&s;ed by any of his creatures. While the glory of GOD is the work I aim at, my &s;oul can l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">k up and rejoice. Then am I in a fit circum&s;tance to find the truth of that promi&s;e of the <HI>ble&s;&s;ed</HI> JESUS, nothing &s;hall by any means hurt you. Then let what will come upon me,
<PB N="17" REF="046575_0017_10219C49741B5718">
what need I care? If GOD is but glorified thereby, I have my heart's de&s;ire. It will be happy living if I live unto the LORD, and it will be happy dying if I die unto the LORD: If the LORD is but glorified by me all will be well, whether in &s;ickne&s;s or health, life or death. Our glorious <HI>Leader</HI> has ca&s;t up a noble high-way called the way of holine&s;s, and the redeemed of the LORD &s;hall walk therein. The <HI>ble&s;&s;ed</HI> Savior walk|ed in this way himself, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eting us a bright ex|ample, and he &s;ays, <HI>Follow me.</HI> And the happy &s;ouls that follow JESUS &s;hall ran and not be weary; &s;hall walk and not be faint: And go from &s;trength to &s;trength, 'till in <HI>Zion</HI> every one &s;hall appear before GOD. Then &s;hall all the glory be forever a&s;cribed to <HI>Him</HI> who only is worthy of prai&s;e from all his creatures, in a &s;pecial manner from tho&s;e that he not on|ly made, but redeemed from eternal mi&s;ery, by his own mo&s;t precious blood.&mdash;Worthy is the LAMB that was &s;lain to receive all glory; ble&s;&s;ing and honor, in time and to eternity.</P>

<HEAD>QUESTION XII. What is the difference between this life and the eternal World, to which you are going?</HEAD>
<P>ANSW. THIS is too hard a que&s;tion for me to an&s;wer whil&s;t I re|main in the tents of mortality: But I can tell &s;ome of my weak ideas. This life is &s;hort, like a vapor that appears a little while and then vani&s;hes away: So uncertain when it will end, that I never know but that the la&s;t hour thereof is really come. But the world to which I am going will never va|ni&s;h away; there my &s;tate will be forever fix|ed, nor &s;hall I ever find the middle nor end thereof. Here I am only as a &s;tranger upon a journey, ha&s;tily pa&s;&s;ing through a narrow wilderne&s;s, where I have no continuing city: But the world to which I am going will be my home, my everla&s;ting habitati|on; I &s;hall not be a &s;tranger there, for I am going to my own People. All the enjoy|ments of this life are uncertain, and may be all &s;uddenly taken from me: I can call no|thing my own, (except it be that good part that <HI>Mary</HI> cho&s;e; if I have got that, it &s;hall never be taken from me, for it is an earne&s;t of the inheritance to which I am going.) All the riches of this world are of but &s;mall value, and will never do for a portion; they
<PB N="19" REF="046575_0019_10219C6596096F08">
cannot &s;atisfy the &s;oul: But all things are certain and enduring in the heavenly world; trea&s;ures laid up there are of infinite value, and will fully &s;atisfy the de&s;ires of an immor|tal &s;oul. The pre&s;ent life is a mixtue of good and evil, joy and &s;orrow: Pro&s;perity and ad|ver&s;ity are &s;et one over again&s;t the other; but there will be no &s;uch mixture in the eternal world. The pre&s;ent life is a &s;tate of war, where we &s;hould &s;hew our valor for our LORD the <HI>King,</HI> in the land where his ene|mies dwell. A &s;tate of trial for a long eter|nity; a place for the poor Saints to mourn and weep under the affliction of a body of &s;in and death: But the world of glory where all the Saints are going, is a &s;tate of triumph|ing over every enemy, a &s;tate of perfect peace, where all that are here tried and come forth as gold, &s;hall need no more trying but &s;hall &s;hine forth as the &s;un in the kingdom of their <HI>Father.</HI> There &s;hall be no mourning, &s;orrow nor crying there; no more trouble with a body of &s;in and death. There &s;hall be given a free reward for all the free grace that the LORD enables his children to im|prove to his glory in time. Here I have &s;ome de&s;ires to prai&s;e the ble&s;&s;ed JESUS; but find I can &s;carce touch upon the notes of that heavenly &s;ong. But I hope I am going where I &s;hall join with all the happy Singers, to prai&s;e my GOD in a &s;weet melodious manner.
<PB N="20" REF="046575_0020_10219C4F3060A4C0">
Here I go mourning from day to day be|cau&s;e of my di&s;tance from the lovely &s;pring of all my joys: But I hope I am going where I &s;hall be &s;atisfied with nearne&s;s to the lovely JESUS, and with the company of all his love|ly children, who are now &s;cattered like &s;heep in a wilderne&s;s, but &s;oon they will be all to|gether, and never be &s;cattered again. Here I am greatly troubled with the mon&s;ter &s;in, who is blowing his poi&s;on breath upon all I do, &s;poiling my be&s;t duties: But I hope I am going where &s;in can never go. O what a &s;hout of prai&s;e I &s;hall &s;ing to my glorious <HI>Deliverer,</HI> if ever I get perfectly free from &s;in! Here I can have but now and then a drop of heavenly plea&s;ure, ju&s;t enough to en|courage and &s;trengthen me to pre&s;s forward on my journey: But when I get home I hope my LORD will make me drink of the River of his plea&s;ure forever. Here I am full of de|&s;ires which are not yet &s;atisfied. But I hope I am going where I &s;hall enjoy more than I can de&s;ire or wi&s;h for here.&mdash;But what can I conceive of the boundle&s;s joys that GOD has prepared for all that love him? O how dark are all my ideas of the eternal world, to which I am ha&s;tily going! Grace is a fore|ta&s;te and earne&s;t of the glorious inheritance, therefore we may know enough thereof in time to ravi&s;h our hearts, and make us long to reach our eternal Home.</P>
