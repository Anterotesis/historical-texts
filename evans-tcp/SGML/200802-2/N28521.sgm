<BIBL>PSALM LXXXIX, 48.</BIBL>
<Q>What man is he that liveth and &s;hall not &s;ee death?</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT hath been the cu&s;tom in every civilized na|tion, to perpetuate the memory of illu&s;trious men by monumental in&s;criptions; or in the hi&s;toric page to record their worth, and to hold up to view their peculiar virtues, not only for the admiration, but for the imitation of &s;uc|ceeding ages: And to promote the &s;ame lau|dable purpo&s;es, funeral &s;ermons, and orations have for &s;everal hundred years been delivered in Europe. And I am per&s;uaded, that &s;carce|ly a congregation in America, hardly a Prea|cher in the UNITED STATES would have omit|ted this la&s;t tribute of re&s;pect, to the worthy character who&s;e death we this day deplore, if the government had <HI>not</HI> recommended it. Let the &s;olemn funeral proce&s;&s;ions in our Cities, and Villages&mdash;Let the elegies, and the orati|ons, that have already been written and deli|vered&mdash;Let the tokens of mourning &s;o gene|rally worn throughout our nation&mdash;Let <HI>these avouch</HI> the truth of my &s;entiment, that; WASH|INGTON, the great, the virtuous WASHING|TON,
<PB N="4" REF="038000_0003_100FB0C1789CCC40">
as he lived <HI>almost</HI> univer&s;ally admired and loved, &s;o he died <HI>universally</HI> lamented. Our a&s;&s;embling in this Church this morning is a partial evidence, that we are of the number who conceive his death to be lo&s;s to our coun|try. But let us remember that Wa&s;hington is not <HI>alone to die;</HI> that, we &s;hall <HI>soon</HI> follow him into the region of eternity, and that the great bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>our</HI> life is to be prepared for <HI>our</HI> death. To a&s;&s;i&s;t my hearers in &s;eeking this preparation, and to recount the virtues of <HI>our</HI> illu&s;trious patriot, <HI>our</HI> hero and <HI>our</HI> friend, are the de&s;igns I have in view in this di&s;cour&s;e; and in order to execute the&s;e important purpo|&s;es, I &s;hall in the,</P>
<P><HI>First</HI> place, Briefly con&s;ider the origin&mdash;the nature&mdash;and the effects of death; and Second|ly, Illu&s;trate the happy con&s;equences of being prepared for this awful hour; and under this head &s;hall introduce the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The hi&s;torick and characteri&s;tic parts of this &s;ermon are derived from the mo&s;t re&s;pectable authorities; or given on my own knowledge. The publications from which I have made extracts are Dr. Mor&s;e's Geography; a peace &s;aid to be written by a Senator of the United States, and publi&s;hed in the news papers of this city; and General Lee's Oration. Sometimes I have omitted <HI>whole &s;entences</HI> in the quotations, in order to include in as few words as po&s;&s;ible the great variety of matter nece&s;&s;arily introduced.</NOTE> character of our de|parted and beloved General. In pur&s;uance of this method; I begin with con&s;idering the ori|gin, nature and effects of death. Fir&s;t its ori|gin. Here we are entirely indebted for infor|mation to the &s;acred oracles; we might enquire,
<PB N="5" REF="038000_0004_100FB0C466F991D0">
but enquire in vain at any other &s;ource to know, whether man was made originally mortal, or, became &s;o by any ca&s;uality. Revelation a&s;|&s;ures us Rom. V-12. "Wherefore as by one man &s;in entered into the world, and death by &s;in; and &s;o death pa&s;&s;ed upon all men, for that all have &s;inned." Our fir&s;t progenitor having ta&s;ted the interdicted fruit, became in&s;tantly liable to the threatned penalty. "In the day that thou eate&s;t thereof thou &s;halt &s;urely die." Gen. 11-17. On that day his &s;oul died to God. i. e. he lo&s;t that knowledge of, and love to God, he &s;o eminently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed before his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; and his body with tho&s;e of his po&s;terity became inevitably &s;ubject to death.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The nature of death; is the di&s;&s;o|lution of the union &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between our bo|dies and our &s;ouls; on this union the animal life depends. This union it is impo&s;&s;ible in our pre&s;ent &s;tate to under&s;tand, or de&s;cribe; it is one of the my&s;teries that in eternity only we &s;hall be able to comprehend. This union is di&s;&s;olved by the command, or permi&s;&s;ion of God, when he &s;ummon&s;es our &s;pirits hence. He gave us life, and when he plea&s;es he dive&s;ts us of it. In vain we try with all our efforts to retain the &s;pirit of departing friends; our pray|ers, and tears are of no avail; they faulter&mdash;they &s;ink&mdash;they die.</P>

</LG></Q>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The effects of death&punc; 1&s;t, It is the termination of our pre&s;ent exi&s;tence; the final period of our joys and &s;orrows concerning the things of this life. The &s;un &s;hall ri&s;e with its accu&s;tomed lu&s;tre, and &s;pread its beaming light, and genial warmth throughout the earth; but not to them who are in the cold and dreary man&s;ions of the grave. The bu&s;y &s;cenes of life no more attract the &s;ight, nor the love of riches, fame, or plea&s;ure, arre&s;t the midnight hour of &s;leep. See, the corpse all pale and wan!&mdash;It's active &s;trength is gone!&mdash;It's vigour pro&s;trate!&mdash;It's hands forget to move, the pliant fingers &s;tiff and cold! Once we &s;urveyed our friend; we &s;aw, admired and loved&mdash;Once we viewed our ri&s;ing offspring, and as they played and prattled our hearts beat fondne&s;s. But, they are dead! Not many days &s;ince we met the eye of our friend&mdash;Our love, with joy and plea|&s;ure; but its clo&s;ed for ever, no more to con|vey in &s;ilent language, the &s;oft, the tender movements of the heart. The tongue, that bu&s;y member &s;o prone to plea&s;e&mdash;to hurt&mdash;to wound moves now no more in &s;candal or in prai&s;e. Death! Death! Di&s;plays his triumphs over every part, and &s;ilence, awful, univer&s;al &s;ilence reigns.</P>
<P>2<HI>ndly.</HI> Death renders all di&s;tinctions void. If we view the repo&s;otiries of our lifele&s;s bo|dies; we &s;hall &s;ee per&s;ons of every age and cha|racter,
<PB N="7" REF="038000_0006_100FB0C9EA0B0020">
of every rank and condition in life; the young and the old, the poor and the rich, the gay and the grave, all mingling promi&s;cu|ou&s;ly their du&s;t <HI>together</HI> in their parent earth. There the poor oppre&s;&s;ed &s;lave lays down at the la&s;t the burden of his toil&s;ome life, and feels his cruel &s;ervitude no more; no more to be rai&s;ed from needful &s;lumber on his bed of earth, nor driven from his &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">anty meal to the hard labours of the day. There lieth the aged pa|rent of a numerous offspring who &s;unk into re&s;t amid&s;t the tears of his progeny. Here is en|tombed the &s;miling infant; the flower nipped as it began to blow. The parents wonder why heaven has been &s;o unkind, and are ready to &s;ay (although improperly) "all the&s;e things are again&s;t me." Thus one generation cometh, and pa&s;&s;eth away, another ri&s;eth, and is no more &s;een. We may &s;ay therefore at the tomb of the Monarch, as well as the &s;lave.
<Q><L>A heap of du&s;t alone remains of thee,</L>
<L>'Tis all thou art, and all the proud &s;hall be.</L></Q>
Oh! tran&s;itory and fleeting life. When will the &s;ons of men learn to think of thee as they ought? when will they <HI>every day,</HI> nay <HI>every hour</HI> recollect, that nothing can &s;hield them from the &s;troke of death? "That there is <HI>no</HI> e&s;cape in that war?" If con&s;ummate beauty could have &s;aved from death, Ab&s;alom, nor Helen would never have died. If valour could have &s;topped his career, Alexander would <HI>now</HI> be traver&s;ing the earth. If philo&s;ophic wi&s;dom, learning or judgment, could have &s;aved mor|tals from his icy arms, a Newton, a Critchton
<PB N="8" REF="038000_0007_100FB0CDC73E8DA0">
and a Locke would &s;till have been living. If piety and u&s;efulne&s;s could have &s;ecured our ex|i&s;tence here, an U&s;her and a Baxter; a White-field and a We&s;ley, would be daily di&s;playing their holy and heavenly zeal, in building up the Church of God; and if love of his country, di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, gentlene&s;s, humanity, va|lour, and patrioti&s;m could have eluded the in|&s;atiate mon&s;ter's gra&s;p, our Wa&s;hington would not have been laid in the &s;ilent tomb. But the unchangable decree of heaven is "<HI>Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.</HI>" And we may enquire in the language of our text, what man is he that liveth, and &s;hall <HI>not</HI> &s;ee death? But our enquiry will be <HI>fruitless and vain.</HI></P>
<P>3<HI>dly.</HI> Another effect of death is &s;till more awful. It is the gate that opens into eternity&mdash;It leads us to God; to receive a reward or a puni&s;hment as our works have been; to hear our impartial, irrevocable doom. No time <HI>now</HI> for repentance; no promi&s;es of acceptance, or pardon to encourage us; no &s;ermons to di|rect us to the &s;inner's friend; no friends to coun&s;el and to pray for us; our &s;tate is unal|terably, unchangably fixed. How nece&s;&s;ary then is it, that we NOW endeavour to attain a &s;uitable preparation for the &s;olemn moment? The happy con&s;equences attending &s;uch a pre|paration, I was in the <HI>second</HI> place to point out. Here we may <HI>first</HI> enquire what this preparati|on is? And,</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st.</HI> We have all &s;inned again&s;t our Maker.
<PB N="9" REF="038000_0008_100FB0D2298662E8">
If we &s;ay we <HI>have not sinned,</HI> we make him a liar, and his word is not in us. 1 John 1 cap. 10. We are <HI>guilty</HI> therefore before God; and if the holy law which we have violated is a righteous law; we are con&s;equently <HI>justly</HI> con|demned; and if &s;o, mu&s;t be under the di&s;plea|&s;ure of the MOST HIGH. This guilt there|fore <HI>must</HI> be pardoned, tho&s;e &s;ins <HI>must</HI> be for|given, or God will <HI>not</HI> receive us to favour or to happine&s;s. Our guilt can only be removed, and pardon be&s;towed, through a deep con&s;ci|ou&s;ne&s;s of our lo&s;t and &s;inful &s;tate; wrought in our &s;ouls by the HOLY SPIRIT, exciting us to confe&s;s&mdash;to mourn for, and to for&s;ake our &s;ins; and by looking to, and believing in that glori|ous &s;aviour who died for our offences. A cloud of &s;criptures prove the&s;e important truths. I &s;hall refer you only to Matt. V. 4. Luke XIII. 3. John XVI. 8. and III. 16. Proverbs XXVIII. 13.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> We are unholy, and con&s;equently un|fit for the company and employments of hea|ven. It would be an in&s;ult to tho&s;e who have bibles in their hou&s;es, or, attend to the exer|ci&s;es of their own minds, to &s;uppo&s;e them ig|norant of this e&s;&s;ential truth. If any doubt it, let them read P&s;alm XIV. 2 &amp; 3&punc; 11. 5. Rom. VI. 16 to 22. I&s;ai 1. 6. In fact, all the ex|hortations to purity and holine&s;s, with which the &s;cripture abounds nece&s;&s;arily pre&s;uppo&s;e that we are unholy. Then it clearly follows, we <HI>must</HI> be made holy, mu&s;t have a di&s;po&s;ition &s;uited to the nature of Heaven, "For without
<PB N="10" REF="038000_0009_100FB0D453DB5FC0">
holine&s;s no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord." Heb. XII. 14. And as we cannot make <HI>ourselves holy</HI> it mu&s;t be wrought <HI>in us</HI> by the power and grace of God. The &s;uitable preparation for death <HI>then</HI> is; to be <HI>justified</HI> thro' faith in the merit &amp; righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Lord Je&s;us; &amp; to be <HI>sanc|tified</HI> through the &s;ame medium, by the Spirit of the living God. That without this work of grace we can have no admittance to heaven, is undeniably proved from Acts XXVI. 18. 1 Cor. VI. II. Colos. 1. 12, 15, 22. Heb. XII. 14. From this work of grace <HI>always</HI> proceeds a life of holy obedience to the precepts of the Go&s;pel. Our Redeemer hath given us this te&s;t to try our religion. "He that hath my com|mandments and keepeth them, <HI>he it is</HI> that loveth ME." The happine&s;s attending &s;uch a preparation I am now to point out. And</P>
<P N="1">1<HI>st.</HI> Such gracious &s;ouls have an abiding con|fidence of the favor of God. St. Paul &s;ays "WE KNOW that if our earthly hou&s;e of this taberna|cle were di&s;&s;olved, we have a building of God, a hou&s;e not made with hands, eternal in the hea|vens." And he again informs us, We are <HI>al|ways confident</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. 2 Cor. V. 1-5-6. How exqui&s;ite the joy that ari&s;es from this con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the favour of God, is beyond the power of language to communicate; called therefore by one who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it for many years, and who could have de&s;cribed it, if any man could, "a joy un&s;peakable and full of glo|ry." This &s;weet &s;en&s;ibility of our heavenly Father's love, cha&s;es from the mind the fear of
<PB N="11" REF="038000_0010_100FB0D97129A9B0">
death. P&s;alm 23-4. "Though I walk through the valley of the &s;hadow of death, <HI>I will fear no evil.</HI>" This calms the terrors, and draws the &s;ting of death: "The &s;ting of death is &s;in, but thanks be to God who giveth us the victory through our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t." 1 Cor. XV. 56. Victory! over its horrors that it cannot amaze; victory! over its power that it cannot detain.</P>
<P>Therefore,</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>ndly.</HI> In every &s;aint when God calls him hence, there is a <HI>willingness</HI> to go. The grace and love of God opens his <HI>grasp</HI> of life. Al|though his friends&mdash;his bo&s;om friend&mdash;his ri&s;|ing progeny are entwined about his heart, with the cords of earthly affection, &s;o clo&s;e and firm, that with the highe&s;t aids of rea&s;on they can never be loo&s;ed. But when our Je&s;us &s;hines into the &s;oul with a ray of heavenly light and joy, his language is "I de&s;ire to depart and to be with Chri&s;t, which is far better. Some of the Saints die in the full triumphs of faith; while others equally pious, who are greatly emaciated by lingering di&s;ea&s;e, feel &s;weet &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and &s;ail more gently with a peaceful &s;tream into the haven of eternal re&s;t. Some have had hard fighting with the adver&s;a|ry on the confines of eternity, but have <HI>always</HI> obtained the victory before the conflict clo&s;ed. "My grace is &s;ufficient for thee." And "I will never leave thee, nor for&s;ake thee," are the le|gacies left to every &s;aint.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly.</HI> They re&s;t from all their toils. "Ble&s;|&s;ed are the dead that die in the LORD from
<PB N="12" REF="038000_0011_100FB0DB020D5848">
henceforth: Yea, &s;aith the Spirit, that they may re&s;t from their labours; and their works do follow them." Rev. XIV-13. In this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> their joys were intermingled with &s;orrows&punc; "But when the ran&s;omed of the <HI>Lord</HI> &s;hall re|turn to Zion, they &s;hall obtain joy and glad|ne&s;s, and <HI>sorrow and sighing</HI> &s;hall flee away." J&s;ai. XXXV. 10. Their grief and &s;orrows in this life ari&s;e from many cau&s;es, not nece&s;|&s;ary now to enumerate; but in that "re&s;t which remains for the people of God," every tear is wiped from every eye; there &s;orrow never comes; there all is calm, and joy and peace.</P>
<P>Once more,</P>
<P N="4">4<HI>thly.</HI> To crown their joys they receive the approbation of their God. "Well done good and faithful &s;ervant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord." The &s;miles of their heavenly Fa|ther when introduced into His glorious pre|&s;ence, fill their enlarged &s;ouls with extatic rapture. But on this part of the &s;ubject I &s;hall not endeavour to enlarge; our excur&s;ions might probably &s;ully the views of that land of re&s;t, they endeavour to exalt. I &s;hall only &s;ay, that be&s;ides the pre&s;ence, and manife&s;ted love of their God, and their Saviour, they &s;hall mingle with Prophets, Patriarchs and Apo&s;tles, and with all tho&s;e great, pious, and illu&s;trious &s;pirits, who through faith and patience have already inherited the promi&s;es. Amid&s;t this heavenly choir; this bright a&s;&s;emblage of the &s;pirits of the ju&s;t made perfect; we may hum|bly hope our much loved Wa&s;hington is gone

<P>This day is dedicated by authority publicly to expre&s;s our &s;orrow (though with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to heaven) for his removal. This day is pe|culiarly &s;et apart to rehear&s;e his matchle&s;s deeds&mdash;To recount his virtues, and declare his prai&s;e.</P>
<Q>He was born the 11th of February 1732 old &s;tile, at the pari&s;h of Wa&s;hington, We&s;tmoreland county in Virginia. Was the fir&s;t fruit of a &s;econd marriage, and received his education from a private tutor employed in the family. He early di&s;covered a di&s;po&s;ition for a military life; and at the age of fifteen was entered as a mid&s;hipman on board a Briti&s;h man of war then on the American coa&s;t, but the reluctance his mother expre&s;&s;ed to his engaging in the &s;ea &s;ervice, occa&s;ioned the pro&s;ecution of the plan to be abandoned.</Q>
<P>"Previous to this transaction when he was but ten years of age his Father died, and the charge of the family devolved on his elde&s;t brother: This brother had a command in the colonial troops employed again&s;t Carthagena; and on his return from that expedition named his new patrimonial Man&s;ion, <HI>Mount Vernon,</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="038000_0013_100FB0E1C5C1F7F0">
in honor of the admiral of that name from whom he had received many civilities, and who commanded the &s;quadron on that expedition. But he did not long &s;urvive; at his decea&s;e the elde&s;t &s;on by the &s;econd marriage (who was our Wa&s;hington) inherited this &s;eat, and a con|&s;iderable landed property. Before he attained to his twentieth year, he was made Adjutant General of the militia in Virginia with the rank of Major. When he was about twenty one years old an event occured which called his abilities into public notice, in 1773 en|croachments were reported to have been made by the French on the territories of the Briti&s;h colonies to the we&s;tward. Major Wa&s;hington was &s;ent with full powers to a&s;certain the facts; to treat with the &s;avages; and to warn the French to de&s;i&s;t from their aggre&s;&s;ions; he per|formed the duties of this mi&s;&s;ion with &s;ingular indu&s;try, intelligence and addre&s;s; and his re|port to governor Didwiddie di&s;covered tho&s;e talents in embryo, which have &s;ince been un|folded to general admiration." In 1755 he was advanced to the rank of colonel, in the provincial troops employed in conjunction with the Briti&s;h forces, to drive the French from their encroachments on our frontiers. We have all heard, or read of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he ob&s;tinate, and unfortunate Braddock who commanded tho&s;e forces. He was totally defeated; &s;lain him&s;elf; his whole force routed; Briti&s;h and American blood mingling and flowing in tor|rents along the banks of the Monongahela. "It was here our youthful Wa&s;hington in the gloomy hour of Indian victory, &s;aved by his

judgment and his valour, the remains of a fly|ing army, pre&s;&s;ed by the conquering &s;avage foe." It was on this occa&s;ion that the Revd. Mr. Davies, who was afterwards Pre&s;ident of Princeton College uttered that remarkable pro|phecy. "That Wa&s;hington was rai&s;ed up by the providence of God to be the <HI>protector and saviour of his country.</HI>" In this war he had at different times &s;eparate commands, in all which victory declared Wa&s;hington her future favo|rite. The great fatigues he underwent in the three &s;ucceeding years of the war, brought on a complaint of the lungs, which it was <HI>then</HI> thought would prove mortal; and tranquility being at this time re&s;tored to the frontiers, by a &s;eries of &s;plendid victories gained by Ameri|can and Briti&s;h valour; Colonel Wa&s;hington re&s;igned his military appointment. His health was gradually re-e&s;tabli&s;hed; and untill the be|ginning of the American revolution he cultivat|ed the arts of peace; he was con&s;tantly a mem|ber of the A&s;&s;embly; a magi&s;trate of his coun|ty; and a judge of the court.</P>
<P>The worth of Wa&s;hington was not yet <HI>fully</HI> known.

We appealed to the world that we were <HI>forced</HI> into the conte&s;t. We appealed to heaven for the <HI>justice</HI> of our cau&s;e. An army was collect|ed in the vicinity of Bo&s;ton. Wa&s;hington was appointed to command. A &s;even years war &s;ucceeds. The memorable events are too re|cent to need a particular recital. It clo&s;ed in the di&s;memberment of a Mighty Empire; <HI>in the establishment of American freedom.</HI></P>
<P>The warrior's &s;word is &s;heathed, and the graceful victor comes dre&s;&s;ed in the garland of peace. His country now completely trium|phant, is univer&s;ally acknowledged indepen|dent and free. Now he enjoys a full recom|pence for all his toils, a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of hav|ing done his duty <HI>with effect;</HI> and with the ap|probation of his fellow citizens. "Entwined with laurel he now returns to his native home equally the object of e&s;teem and admiration: He lives the theme of the brave, the coun&s;ell of the wi&s;e, the benefactor of the poor, and the friend of mankind."</P>
<P>The confederation the&s;e &s;tates had formed in the hour of danger, was found after 11 years trial to be inadequate for a peaceful &s;y&s;|tem;
<PB N="17" REF="038000_0016_100FB0E89ADE6718">
indeed it was a compound of nece&s;&s;ity and jealou&s;y which threatned danger <HI>only</HI> held together; the danger being over, it relaxed in all its parts, and was rapidly &s;inking to a di&s;|&s;olution. The nece&s;&s;ity of a new &s;y&s;tem of go|vernment appeared to all&mdash;A convention was called&mdash;Wa&s;hington pre&s;ided. A con&s;titution is formed on the model of human perfection; combining in its various branches whatever is excellent in every other form of government, and partaking of <HI>none</HI> of their defects.

Wa&s;hington is equal to every danger. He proclaims the laws of peace; yet wi&s;ely <HI>prepares</HI> for war. He lays the foundation of his policy in the principles of private ju&s;tice, and public faith;" from these he deviates not a moment, and his country <HI>now</HI> feels and rejoices in their good effects. How well he performed his part, how highly we e&s;teemed, and approved his conduct, are clearly evinced by the univer&s;al call for him to fill the pre&s;idental chair again without <HI>one</HI> di&s;&s;enting voice. "Again he &s;erves, and again he manife&s;ts that he is &s;till

To recount all his &s;ervices, and the difficulty of &s;teering at the helm of government, amid&s;t the convul|&s;ive wars and jarring intere&s;ts of the European nations, would take up too much time; let it &s;uffice to &s;ay, that wi&s;dom, prudence and firm|ne&s;s were di&s;covered on every occa&s;ion. His duty well performed he once more returns to dome&s;tic life. "He &s;erved from a &s;en&s;e of du|ty, and he retired from a voluntary choice." But how uncertain is the &s;tate of human af|fairs? While we were cultivating peace with all the ho&s;tile powers, a cloud gathered in our hori&s;on, and the alarm of threatened war again was heard throughout our land. Our cities, our villages re&s;ound with martial mu&s;ic; em|battled ranks of <HI>Volunteers</HI> proffer their &s;ervice to repel the foe&mdash;an army is rai&s;ing, and Wa&s;hington, the aged Wa&s;hington is invited to command.

virtues it is true, but they were tarni&s;h|ed by their defects. Alexander was brave like Wa&s;hington, but he was cruel and intemper|ate. Cae&s;ar was intrepid, but he en&s;laved his country.

But our Wa&s;hington was, <HI>thirdly:</HI> di&s;intere&s;t|ed. Let it be remembered that he received <HI>no pay</HI> for his long and toil&s;ome &s;ervices: he &s;uffered, he fought for his country's freedom, and not for its money.

"When I was fir&s;t called to the &s;tation with which I was honoured during the late con|flict for our liberties; to the diffidence which I had &s;o many rea&s;ons to feel in accepting it, I thought it my duty to join a firm re&s;olution to &s;hut my hand again&s;t <HI>every pecuniary recom|pence.</HI>"</P>

<P>6<HI>thly.</HI> He was a u&s;eful citizen; as he ever paid the &s;tricte&s;t obedience to the laws of the land. He encouraged every plan calculated to increa&s;e the welfare of our country.
