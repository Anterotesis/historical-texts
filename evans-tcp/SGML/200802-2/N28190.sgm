<OPENER><SALUTE>My Beloved and Respected Christian Brethren,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is with &s;ingular and &s;olemn plea&s;ure I now &s;tand before you in this &s;acred place: Called as I am by the <HI>Divine Providence,</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t to day in opening the fir&s;t religious <HI>Temple,</HI> that has ever been erected in the&s;e U. States, for the wor&s;hip of the Al|mighty in the &s;ole and individual per&s;on of <HI>Jesus Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>The brief but comprehen&s;ive precept which forms the ba&s;is of my intended di&s;cour&s;e, manife&s;tly in|volves the de&s;ign and u&s;e of this, and every other religious temple in the world; and is confe&s;&s;edly a &s;ubject of primary importance, and indi&s;criminate application to every rational being in heaven and earth.</P>
<P>The gloomy athei&s;t indeed&mdash;the &s;ilent language of who&s;e heart, or public language of who&s;e lectures, is "<HI>There is no God,</HI>"&mdash;may attempt to deny its &s;acred and awful importance; but, as &s;uch learned fools have &s;unk them&s;elves on the &s;cale of exi&s;tence below the degree of rationality; and as the divine providence has never &s;uffered &s;uch impious mon&s;ters to "<HI>increase and multiply</HI>" on the earth, and pol|lute &s;ociety with their horrid bla&s;phemy; let us hope
<PB N="6" REF="037577_0004_100EDEF7D89096E8">
that but few more of them will ever more di&s;grace the human nature, by appearing among&s;t us in a hu|man form.</P>
<P>I need not inform my re&s;pected hearers, who are conver&s;ant with their bibles, that the emphatical text which I have now cho&s;en to enlarge upon, was ad|dre&s;&s;ed to the beloved St. John, by a glorious and dignified angel of heaven; who though once a man on earth, now &s;hone with &s;uch re&s;plendent beatitude, that the in&s;pired evangeli&s;t him&s;elf mi&s;took him for his adorable ma&s;ter, and fell at his feet to wor&s;hip him.</P>
<P>But as this act, however pure the motive, or zea|lous the performance, was directed towards an im|proper <HI>object,</HI> the faithful delegate of heaven imme|diately entered his &s;olemn prote&s;t again&s;t it, by a "<HI>See thou do it not;</HI>" whereby we are plainly in|formed, that all religious wor&s;hip which is grounded in &s;uper&s;tition, or idolatry, cannot be <HI>truly</HI> accept|able to God, however &s;incere or holy the wor&s;hiper may be.</P>
<P>It is a very remarkable fact, and merits our at|tention, that the Revelations of St. John were rejected from the &s;acred canons, by tho&s;e called the fathers of the church, during the long period of the fir&s;t three or four chri&s;tian centuries; though their divine au|thority, and peculiar excellency have long &s;ince been univer&s;ally admitted&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y all the various and contend|ing &s;ects of Chri&s;tians now in the world.</P>
<P>This brief remark may a&s;&s;i&s;t to perceive, that the&s;e my&s;terious but divine revelations, were more pecu|liarly de&s;igned for the in&s;truction of future ages, than for tho&s;e already pa&s;t; while at the &s;ame time it clearly evinces, that the rejection of any particular book, or doctrine, (even by the generality of the Chri&s;tian church, and that for ages,) is no infallible proof again&s;t its &s;acred and divine athuority.</P>
<P>Indeed the very contrary is a truth too notorious
<PB N="7" REF="037577_0004_100EDEF7D89096E8">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o be denied; that whenever the "<HI>Sun of Righteous|ness,</HI>" has &s;hone upon the world with additional lu&s;|tre, mankind in general have "<HI>Loved darkness ra|ther than light,</HI> and rejected the council of GOD again&s;t their own &s;ouls; &s;o that&mdash;<HI>Who hath believed our report,</HI>" has been the con&s;tant lamentation of ho|ly and in&s;pired men, in every age of the Church.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t awful proof of the truth of this remark, that ever was exhibited, was by the Jews at the fir&s;t advent of our Lord; for notwith&s;tanding he &s;pake as never man &s;pake, &s;o as to bring "<HI>Life and immor|tality to light;</HI>" yet, the&s;e &s;tubborn and &s;elf-righte|ous bigots, unwilling to relinqui&s;h their enormous in|fluence over the &s;uper&s;titious multitude,&mdash;traduced the Lord of life, and rejected all his &s;acred precepts, crying out, "He is a gluttonous man, and a wine bibber,&mdash;an enemy to Caesar, and to the law of Mo|&s;es,&mdash;He hath a devil and is mad, why hear ye him? away with him,&mdash;crucify him,&mdash;it is not fit that he &s;hould live!"</P>
<P>From a conduct equally &s;tubborn, criminal and fatal,&mdash;"<HI>Good Lord deliver</HI> us.</P>
<P>This &s;udden ejaculation has been prompted by a deep and painful conviction, founded, I pre&s;ume on evangelical prophecy, that the &s;econd advent of our Lord, as powerful and glorious as it is de&s;cribed, and expected to be, (and as it will really be in a &s;piritual &s;en&s;e) will notwith&s;tanding be as generally rejected, or mi&s;taken by the chri&s;tian world, as his fir&s;t com|ing was by the Jews; and probably from &s;imilar mo|tives, particularly from re&s;ting too much in the mere literal &s;en&s;e of &s;cripture, unexplained by doctrine.</P>
<P>This however will not be the ca&s;e with tho&s;e, who while they&mdash;"<HI>Search the scriptures;</HI>" attend to the import of our Lord's general comment upon them; to wit.
"The letter killeth;&mdash;<HI>and again,</HI> "The words that I speak unto you they are spirit;"
by which, he plainly intimated to the Jews, as far as their inveterate prejudices, and contracted &s;tate of

illumination would admit, that many pa&s;&s;ages in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> "<HI>law and the prophets,</HI>" if taken in the mere LI+TERAL &s;en&s;e, proclaimed war and death not only again&s;t the true principles of &s;cience and rea&s;on&punc; but al&s;o again&s;t all the glorious and adorable attribute<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of God! Not &s;o the genuine or &s;piritual &s;en&s;e of the WORD, as now in mercy revealed, in the neglected but profound writings, of that rational philo&s;opher and enlightened &s;eer, Emanuel Swedenborg.</P>
<P>This &s;en&s;e, by pre&s;erving the mo&s;t re&s;pectful a&s;pect towards all the divine attributes, and cordi|ally recognizing the true principles of &s;cience and rea&s;on, <HI>rescues</HI> the holy word of in&s;piration, from the growing contempt to which it would other|wi&s;e hereafter be evidently expo&s;ed:&mdash;while at the &s;ame time it opens an ine&s;timable and inexhau&s;tible fountain of <HI>true</HI> &s;cience, and <HI>heavenly</HI> wi&s;dom, which has been hidden from pa&s;t ages, and generations.</P>
<P>But, waving all further introductory remarks, I would mo&s;t re&s;pectfully &s;olicit your intire attention&punc; while I enter more directly upon my &s;ubject&mdash;
"WORSHIP GOD."</P>
<P>And let every creature in heaven and earth &s;ay, <HI>Amen;</HI>&mdash;for it is a heavenly exhortation, and a hea|venly employment; ; and if performed aright, in|cludes in my opinion&mdash;
THE WHOLE DUTY OF MAN.</P>
<P>In order therefore to contribute my mite towards the right performance of this all comprehen&s;ive duty, by the humble and &s;incere chri&s;tian, I &s;hall proceed to a more particular con&s;ideration of the two grand propo&s;itions, or doctrinal notes, which naturally flow from my &s;ubject.&mdash;viz.</P>

<P>In the 10th ch. and 30th v. of St. John's Go&s;pel, our Lord ventured to tell the Jews, that He and the Father were ONE; but the re&s;ult of the declaration of this naked or genuine truth, was, that they took

up &s;tones to &s;tone him; hence we find him replying to them in this &s;ame Go&s;pel, "I have yet many things to &s;ay unto you, but ye cannot bear them now."</P>
<P>And a few ver&s;es forward he added, "The&s;e things have I &s;poken unto you in proverbs: the time cometh, when I &s;hall no more &s;peak unto you in pro|verbs, but I &s;hall &s;hew you plainly of the father."</P>
<P>What he was willing then to "&s;hew them" re&s;|pecting the "Father," we may learn &s;omething of, if we attend to his reply to Phillip when he pre&s;&s;ed him clo&s;ely upon this very &s;ubject&mdash;"Have I been &s;o long time with you, and yet ha&s;t thou not known me, Phillip?

<P>In the 1&s;t. chapt. of the&s;e heavenly revelations out of which I am furni&s;hed with the ground of my pre|&s;ent lecture, we find our Lord three different times declaring from heaven to the beloved di&s;ciple and apo&s;tle St. John, that he was the "ALPHA &amp; OMEGA," the "fir&s;t and the la&s;t," which undoubtedly mu&s;t in|clude <HI>all persons,</HI> and principles that can po&s;&s;ibly be conceived in the DEITY: To cite any more &s;cripture pa&s;&s;ages then, in proof that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the Father and Holy Gho&s;t, or the "Fir&s;t and the la&s;t," per&s;ons (as they are called) in the trinity, as well as the &s;econd, I judge &s;uperfluous.</P>
<P>It may not be &s;uperfluous however, to ob&s;erve here, that it was from a deep and impartial con&s;ideration
<PB N="14" REF="037577_0008_100EDF00DA3F3530">
of my pre&s;ent &s;ubject; and the great di&s;cordance of the leading articles of my former faith, (and of the pre&s;ent prevailing faith of the whole chri&s;tian world) both with &s;cripture, and rea&s;on, that I was led to that important and unpopular &s;tep, which I took &s;ome time ago, in re&s;igning my official &s;tation and member|&s;hip, in the Methodi&s;t E. Church.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t and &s;econd of the&s;e articles I would beg leave to lay before you, and briefly remark upon; and, I appeal to the "&s;earcher of hearts," that I am not led to this mode of proceeding from the mo&s;t di&s;tant wi&s;h to offend any here pre&s;ent; or to excite a controver&s;y with &s;uch of my chri&s;tian brethren, who, in "&s;implicity and godly &s;incerity," &s;till &s;ub|&s;cribe to the&s;e articles alluded to; but from a hope, that while it may &s;erve as a brief and general apology for my own conduct, it may at the &s;ame time render &s;ome &s;ervices to the true intere&s;t of pure uncorrupt|ed chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>In the Methodi&s;t E. Church, (and I believe in the Prote&s;tant E. Church) the articles of faith re&s;pecting the Object of our wor&s;hip read as follows:</P>
<P>"ART. I. There is but One living and true God, everla&s;ting, without body or parts, of infinite power, wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s; the maker and pre&s;erver of all things both vi&s;ible and invi&s;ible. And in unity of this godhead there are three per&s;ons, of one &s;ub|&s;tance, power and eternity; the Father, the Son, and the Holy Gho&s;t.</P>
<P>"ART. II. The Son who is the word of the Father, the very and eternal God, of one &s;ub&s;tance with the Father, took man's nature in the womb of the ble&s;&s;ed virgin; &s;o that two whole and perfect natures, that is to &s;ay, the Godhead and manhood, were joined together in One per&s;on, never to be divided, whereof is one Chri&s;t, very god and very man, who truly &s;uf|fered was crucified, dead and buried, to reconcile his

father to us, and to be a &s;acrifice not only for origi|nal guilt, but al&s;o for actual &s;ins of men."</P>
<P>NOW, the almo&s;t omnipotent, and almo&s;t mira|culous prejudice of education, and nothing le&s;s, prevents the &s;incere chri&s;tian (as it did my&s;elf for many years) from perceiving, that though the&s;e ar|ticles contain &s;ome truths, they contain at the &s;ame time many gro&s;s and palpable errors: in which rea|&s;on and common &s;en&s;e have nothing to do; and by which &s;ome, if not all, the adorable and e&s;&s;ential at|tributes of God, (as before enumerated) are, flatly denied&mdash;that I &s;ay not bla&s;phemed.</P>
<P>The power of expre&s;&s;ing our thoughts to each other by human language, is ju&s;tly acknowledged to be one of the chief felicities, and characteri&s;tics of man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> but in order to promote and perfectly accompli&s;h this ine&s;timable privilege; and avoid all unintelligi|ble jargon, it is ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite that we attach to each word a po&s;itive and fixed meaning, expre&s;&s;ive of the idea which properly belongs to it: Thus for in&s;tance, when the &s;criptures inform us that "God is a &s;pirit," we readily conceive that he is an imma|terial being; and as the &s;ame &s;criptures emphati|cally call him holy; and the "Holy one of I&s;rael;" it is but ju&s;t and logical to conclude that GOD, and the HOLY SPIRIT or "Holy Gho&s;t" imply ONE and the &s;ame per&s;on and no more: How then, in the name of every thing rational, can this name or term, to wit, The Holy Spirit, or Holy Gho&s;t, which was evidently de&s;igned to expre&s;s the whole e&s;&s;ence or integer of the Deity, be made u&s;e of with any de|gree of propriety to &s;ignify only a fractional or third part of him? Can a part be equal to the whole? Or rather can the whole be contained in a third part?</P>
<P>Again: In the preceeding part of the Fir&s;t Art. referred to, it is a&s;&s;erted that God is a being with|out "Body or Parts." Why then does the latter part of the &s;ame article a&s;&s;ure us, that he is divided into <HI>three</HI> di&s;tinct parts, or per&s;ons?</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="037577_0009_100EDF0312EB5A70" MS="y">would a&s;k, if the Divine being is divi&s;ible, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> not material? if he has NO body, how can he be &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+&s;tantial? and, if he has no PARTS, how can he B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> or EXIST, at all?

<P>Surely every chri&s;tian knows, or ought to know (with St. Paul,) that there are not only bodies terre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">+trial, but bodies cele&s;tial al&s;o; and as it is plai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> there can be no body without its corre&s;ponding e&s;&s;ence it mu&s;t evidently follow, there can be no e&s;&s;enc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> without its corre&s;ponding body: Material e&s;&s;ence have material bodies; and &s;piritual e&s;&s;ences mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> have &s;piritual bodies al&s;o.</P>
<P>Another obvious di&s;cordance in the&s;e &s;aid article<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is, that they both maintain and deny a trinity of per+&s;ons in the Godhead;&mdash;For whil&s;t the Fir&s;t Articl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a&s;&s;erts that "in unity of this Godhead there are thre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> per&s;ons," The Second Article declares that, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> whole and perfect nature of the Godhead, was unite<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to the whole and perfect nature of the manhood, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ONE per&s;on, to wit.

<P>But what &s;hall we think, or what &s;hall we &s;ay re&s;|pecting the latter part of the 2d. article afore-men|tioned, where it is plainly avowed, that the "very God" was crucified&mdash;died&mdash;and was buried! And that, to "reconcile his father," (who is &s;aid to be an|other different per&s;on) to us!!!</P>
<P>Here then we have repre&s;ented to us, ONE divine per&s;on or God, dying&mdash;to reconcile another Di|vine per&s;on, or God, who certainly is &s;uppo&s;ed to be, not only very angry but very mutable al&s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="037577_0009_100EDF0312EB5A70">Now to pa&s;s over the doctrine of a God dying and being buried, &amp;c. I would ob&s;erve that the opinion of St, Paul on the &s;ubject is the very rever&s;e of this: for he &s;ays that "God was in Chri&s;t reconciling the world to him&s;elf;" which clearly proves, that God was reconciled to all mankind; but that they were not reconciled to him.</P>
<P>Indeed to &s;uppo&s;e that God ever was, or can be angry, and then, anon reconciled, through the in|treaties of another per&s;on, different from him&s;elf, which other per&s;on al&s;o is "very and eternal God," is, in my opinion, not only a denial of the unity of God, but has a near affinity to down right bla&s;phemy again&s;t his divine love and his divine wi&s;dom; for it is plain and certain, that his infinite love mu&s;t render him as incapable of wrath or anger towards his own creatures, as his infinite wi&s;dom renders him incapable of any change, or alteration, in his own divine purpo&s;es and de&s;igns.</P>
<P>The foregoing ob&s;ervations on the true OBJECT of Chri&s;tian wor&s;hip, are, (in my opinion) &s;o conclu|&s;ive and powerful again&s;t the modern and prevaling doctrine of a trinity of per&s;ons in the Godhead; that there is no other way left to elude their force; but by plainly declaring, that <HI>reason</HI> has nothing to do in the inve&s;tigation; and that its voice or dictates are not to be regarded on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>But my beloved and re&s;pected audience permit me to a&s;&s;ure you, that it is a here&s;y of the greate&s;t magnitude and replete with the mo&s;t dangerous con|&s;equences to &s;uppo&s;e, or maintain that Rea&s;on and Revelation, are at variance with each other; for they are both, equally the voice of God,&mdash;which mu&s;t be con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf, whatever the voice of man may be.</P>
<P>The Socinian and the Dei&s;t,&mdash;&s;hould there be any &s;uch here to day, will doubtle&s;s agree to this la&s;t ob|&s;ervation;
<PB N="18" REF="037577_0010_100EDF04A0286C00">
but though the&s;e gentlemen are ea&s;ily con|vinced of the errors attached to the modern doctrine of the trinity,&mdash;they cannot yet &s;ub&s;cribe to ours.&mdash; The rea&s;on I pre&s;ume is, becau&s;e OUR peculiar doc|trine of the DIVINITY of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t has not yet been properly opened and explained to them; &mdash;whereby they would clearly perceive, that Our JESUS, and Their GOD are indeed the very &s;ame.</P>
<P>For as names cannot alter the nature of things, it is perfectly immaterial (in my opinion) by what name we di&s;tingui&s;h the Object of our wor&s;hip, whe|ther, (as Pope &s;ays) "Jehovah, Jove, or Lord;" provided we attach to this One name all the e&s;&s;en|tial and incommunicable attributes of Deity.</P>
<P>Be it known then, to all whom it may concern, that the members of the Lord's New Church, do not wor&s;hip that natural body which was derived from Mary, and the principles of this world, and which was crucified, &amp;c. Becau&s;e they do not believe that this body ever was, or ever can be tran&s;muted into, or commixed with the Deity. No, this &s;pecies of &s;uper&s;tition and idolatry we leave, to tho&s;e who know no better.</P>
<P>The material &s;uperinduced body; or Son of Ma|ry, together with what&s;oever of infirmity was therein derived, was indeed nece&s;&s;ary to be a&s;&s;umed by the Lord God for purpo&s;es of redemption, and manife&s;|tation, to men in this natural world; but this mere Son of Mary, is not the true "Son of God," or &s;avi|or of the world. The Savior which We wor&s;hip, is the Divine Wi&s;dom, of the Divine Love, who is in|deed a Mediator, or a medium of acce&s;s and com|munication, between the Divine love or inmo&s;t principle of Deity, and created intelligences.</P>
<P>Not that we in&s;inuate, that the Divine Wi&s;dom, (which we al&s;o call, "The form of God") can be, or ever was, &s;eparated from the Divine love, (which we al&s;o call the e&s;&s;ence or inmo&s;t principle of God;)
<PB N="19" REF="037577_0010_100EDF04A0286C00">
except by way of manife&s;tation: but the Divine love we apprehend, is imperceptible to every created be|ing, and as unapproachable as a "con&s;uming fire;" while the Divine Wi&s;dom is perceptible to every Angel in the heavens, but differently to each, accord|ing to their individual &s;tates of illumination and af|fection.</P>
<P>To conclude this head of Doctrine then; we op|po&s;e the <HI>modern</HI> doctrine of a trinity of per&s;ons in the Deity; but we do not deny the true <HI>Scripture doc|trine</HI> of a trinity of Principles in the Deity, even as there is in every individual living man. Thus for in&s;tance, The Divine Love or inmo&s;t principle of Je|hovah corre&s;ponds to the Soul of man, and may by way of accommodation, be called the Father. The Divine Wi&s;dom or manife&s;ted form, of Deity, cor|re&s;ponds to the Body of man and may by way of ac|commodation as afore&s;aid be called the SON; and the Divine proceeding power likewi&s;e, from the Di|vine Wi&s;dom of the Divine Love, corre&s;ponds to the volitions or actions of man, and may with con&s;i|derable propriety be called the Holy Spirit, or Holy Gho&s;t:&mdash;All, together, con&s;tituting but One glori|ous object of chri&s;tian wor&s;hip,&mdash;who is,
<Q><L>"Not quite di&s;play'd to worlds above</L>
<L>Nor quite on earth conceal'd."</L></Q></P>
<P>Submitting the foregoing remarks on the true Ob|ject of our wor&s;hip, to your &s;erious and impartial con&s;ideration, I &s;hall now proceed, to make a few ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>IIdly. On the true NATURE of Chri&s;tian Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>On this head however I mu&s;t be very brief, that I tre&s;pa&s;s not on the patience of my attentive and re&s;pected hearers. And indeed, it appears to me that if the true Object of wor&s;hip be properly com|prehended, we can be &s;ubject to no very material
<PB N="20" REF="037577_0011_100EDF06D7CC6458">
error in the Nature and mode of the wor&s;hip which we may be inclined to offer unto him.</P>
<P>This remark cannot fail of being ju&s;tified by all tho&s;e who have made them&s;elves acquainted with the Theology of various ages and nations; and their con|&s;equent modes or rites of religious wor&s;hip; for it is certain that the peculiar ideas of mankind, at all times, and in all places, gave a colour or form to their manner of wor&s;hip; &s;o that it has been more or le&s;s rational and &s;piritual in exact proportion to the rationality, or &s;pirituality of their ideas re&s;pect|ing the Object of wor&s;hip; and <HI>vice versa.</HI></P>
<P>I would not in&s;inuate however, from this remark, that the particular mode or manner of our wor&s;hip|ing God, can ju&s;tify or condemn, &s;ave or damn any one; for if errors of faith or wor&s;hip originate from prejudice of education, or other unavoidable cir|cum&s;tances which are in&s;eparably connected with certain local &s;ituations; I doubt whether our per&s;ons would be brought into a &s;tate of condemnation, were our wor&s;hip directed to "four-footed bea&s;ts and creeping things;" or even to devils!</P>
<P>Indeed the apo&s;tle Paul inform us in the 10th c. and 20th v. of his 1&s;t. epi&s;tle to the Corinthians, that the Heathens or Gentiles did &s;acrifice to devils, not intentionally, I pre&s;ume, but ignorantly; there|fore among&s;t the&s;e Gentile wor&s;hipers, a faithful "Centurion." and a ju&s;t "Cornelius," were recog|nized by a "faithful and ju&s;t Creator;" who far from condemning them for their inevitable errors of faith and wor&s;hip, openly, and highly approved of them both; di&s;tingui&s;hing between, the wor&s;hiper, and the wor&s;hip&mdash;the intention, and the act&mdash;the head, and the heart.</P>
<P>Wor&s;hip, then, may be &s;aid to con&s;i&s;t of two dif|ferent or di&s;tinct parts, the one <HI>external,</HI> the other <HI>internal</HI>: The former is the body of wor&s;hip&punc; the latter the &s;oul. But, as the body without the &s;pi|rit
<PB N="21" REF="037577_0011_100EDF06D7CC6458">
(or &s;oul) is dead; &s;o al&s;o is external wor&s;hip, when &s;eparated from internal; and as both &s;oul and body mu&s;t be united to form or con&s;titute a living man; &s;o al&s;o external wor&s;hip mu&s;t be united to in|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ernal, to become truly acceptable to God, and pro|fitable to the wor&s;hiper, in furthering his regenera|tion.</P>
<P>Time will not permit me now to enter into a mi|nute detail of all the various actions, and attitudes, words and works which enter into; or fall under the denomination of what may be called external wor|&s;hip; &mdash;or the particular di&s;po&s;itions and affections, antipathies and de&s;ires which are nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ti|tute true and acceptable internal wor&s;hip; let it &s;uf|fice to ob&s;erve, that a very knave or hypocrite may perform all the former; while none but a truly good per&s;on can po&s;&s;e&s;s the latter.</P>
<P>But though it is certain that goodne&s;s of heart alone, will render our per&s;ons acceptable unto God, it does not follow that that alone, will render all our actions &s;o;&mdash;el&s;e why &s;hould the angel &s;ay to St. John, even when the latter was about to perform a religious act, and what he conceived to be his indi&s;|pen&s;able duty, "See thou do it not."</P>
<P>In order therefore that our acts of wor&s;hip, may be approved, as well as our per&s;ons, by the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t our <HI>Savior</HI> and our <HI>God</HI> we mu&s;t wor&s;hip him not only in Spirit, but in Truth al&s;o, that is, our wor|&s;hip mu&s;t be not only pious, but rational.</P>
<P>But this, I humbly pre&s;ume is not the ca&s;e, with &s;uch as direct their wor&s;hip to an angry, vengeful, changeful, partial BEING; who is &s;ubject to any divi&s;ion, or &s;ub-divi&s;ion into different per&s;ons.</P>
<P>If any per&s;on therefore, my beloved, (however &s;acred, dignified or popular his character may be,) &s;hould by word or deed, "entice" you to the wor|&s;hip of &s;uch "&s;trange Gods,"&mdash;"See thou do it not;"&mdash;on the contrary obey the law of GOD, and

"Stone him." I &s;ay, "Stone him," not with natu|ral &s;tones, however; but with &s;piritual; with rati|onal arguments, and truths of doctrine; derived from the principles of &s;cience, and the authority of the holy &s;criptures.</P>
<P>But who can overcome "Goliah of Gath," who&s;e &s;tature is "&s;ix cubits and a &s;pan?" Who can con|quer prejudice of education, who&s;e enormous growth is of many ages? Oh! ye men of the New Church, "The battle is not yours but the Lords;" therefore be not afraid, for the &s;tripling David, (or New Jeru|&s;alem Doctrine) though not yet <HI>crowned,</HI> &s;hall, with a few "&s;mooth &s;tones of the brook;" (or truths of &s;cience) &s;lay the Goliah of Prejudice, and with his own &s;word, (or the <HI>literal</HI> &s;en&s;e of the word,) cut off his head,&mdash;while the &s;word &s;hall be pre&s;erved in the tents of David.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now conclude.&mdash;My di&s;cour&s;e has been &s;ufficiently tedious;&mdash;and like the pre&s;ent &s;tate of our little Temple, plain and unadorned.</P>
<P>Indeed I had neither lei&s;ure nor ability to dre&s;s it in the tin&s;elled and flowing robes of rhetoric;&mdash;and if I had both, it would only be as paint on a gla&s;s window which ob&s;cures rather than admits the light; or like the glo&s;&s;y ba&s;ili&s;k who&s;e very pre&s;ence oft times poi&s;ons the beholder; but logic is like the "tree of life," who&s;e very leaves are for the healing of our prejudiced and di&s;ordered minds. I leave the application to God, and your own con&s;ciences; For, "Paul may plant, and Apollos water;" but it is Je&s;us Chri&s;t alone that can give the wi&s;hed for in|crea&s;e of rational and &s;piritual conviction from what has now been &s;aid, therefore.</P>
<P>To him be glory and maje&s;ty, dominion and pow|er, both now and ever.&mdash;<HI>Amen.</HI></P>
