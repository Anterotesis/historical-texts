<P>HAD we a&s;&s;embled this day, my fel|low-citizens, for the purpo&s;e of private mourn|ing, that we might &s;ympathize with a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed family deprived of a parent, or weep over the ruins of youth and beauty when conveyed to the tomb, our conduct would de&s;erve approbation and re&s;pect. We are MEN, and therefore, I tru&s;t, never in&s;en&s;ible of the calls of humanity. An event far more important arre&s;ts our notice, and hath given birth to the &s;olemnities of the day. The common triumphs of the la&s;t enemy of man, though &s;evere and terrible; yet are &s;hort in their effects. When <HI>one generation pa&s;&s;eth away</HI> another

ri&s;es in its place. When wi&s;e and good men of local eminence retire from the world, others are rai&s;ed up by Providence to fill their &s;tations. If the flowers are de&s;troyed by the &s;everity of winter fro&s;ts, &s;till the &s;pring will repair their ravages. Though the &s;un <HI>goeth down</HI> in the we&s;tern hemi&s;|phere he will again ari&s;e, he will &s;hine on new forms of beauty in the natural world&mdash;and on a new &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of rational beings, who in turn mu&s;t pay the like tribute to mortality. But when will the beams of that glorious luminary again be reflected on &s;uch an object as we now lament; when in any future period will they behold one, who like him, &s;o perfectly united in him&s;elf the amiable citizen, the uncorrupt patriot, and the invincible hero; one whom we know not whether more to love for the excellent qualities of his heart, or admire for his peerle&s;s greatne&s;s and &s;plendid appearance on the human drama? Our <HI>civil Fathers</HI> have pronounced him "Fir&s;t in War, Fir&s;t in peace, and Fir&s;t in the affections of the people." The re-echoing groans and &s;ighs of millions of our nation, have demon&s;trated their warm approbation of the &s;entiment.</P>

amu&s;ements, as the nativity of the political &s;aviour of his country: this day, witne&s;&s;es our keen &s;en&s;i|bilities for his death, and our unaffected gratitude to his memory.</P>
<P>IN paying due honours and the la&s;t offices of re&s;|pect, in our power, to the highe&s;t grade of human virtue, we copy after the be&s;t and faire&s;t exam|ples of antiquity, both &s;acred and profane. Even in the pure and &s;imple ages of the world we find the patriarch Jacob followed to the grave by all his countrymen and kindred, as well as by the Egyptian Court. The children of I&s;rael mourn|ed thirty days for Mo&s;es their illu&s;trious leader, who delivered them from &s;lavery, and conducted them to Canaan. The princes and patriots of the &s;ame nation, were honoured after their exit by all the &s;ignals of public mourning&mdash;and the monu|ment of David exi&s;ted for more than a thou&s;and years.</P>
<P>THE Athenians, renowned through the world for their great wi&s;dom and acquirements, though &s;o jealous of their liberties that they bani&s;hed from their country citizens, who&s;e power, or even vir|tues, gave them too great an a&s;cendancy; yet granted to the &s;ame, as well as to other great men,

who were their benefactors, funeral honours which equalled in pomp and magnificence their religious &s;olemnities. In other nations of Greece, as well as among the Romans, the inventors of Arts and Sciences; the authors of free governments, and the de&s;troyers of tyranny; tho&s;e who had fought and died for their country, have been held in the highe&s;t veneration. They were admitted even to divine honours, their deeds of glory have been re|corded by the hi&s;torian, have been embelli&s;hed by the orator, and &s;ounded by the poet. The arts of painting and of &s;tatuary have lent their aid&mdash; that after ages might not only be favored with the di&s;play of their minds, but gratified in beholding &mdash;the very image of their per&s;ons. Criminal and ungrateful &s;hould we be, my fellow town&s;men, if we &s;uffered our illu&s;trious Friend to depart from life without mingling our tears with the re&s;t of our countrymen. Is it not the duty of America to exhibit &s;uch an example of wi&s;dom and virtue&mdash; &s;uch courage, public &s;pirit, and u&s;efulne&s;s to man|kind, as a model for po&s;terity? Our hearts give a &s;ufficient reply&mdash;he is worthy of our love and ad|miration&mdash;and he &s;hall ever retain them.

<P>GEORGE WASHINGTON was born the eleventh of <HI>February</HI> 1732, of an ancient and hon|ourable family in the Commonwealth of <HI>Virginia.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In one edition of Dr. <HI>MORSE's</HI> Geography, in a &s;hort biographical account of General <HI>WASHINGTON,</HI> it is &s;aid&mdash;"That his ance&s;tors were Royali&s;ts and emigrated to <HI>Virginia,</HI> after the death of <HI>Charles I.</HI> when <HI>England</HI> became a Republic." The follow|ing extract from <HI>Oldmixon</HI>'s hi&s;tory of <HI>England,</HI> publi&s;hed A. D. <HI>1730,</HI> affords a corroborating proof of that a&s;&s;ertion.</P>

He continued his attacks with great re&s;olution, and was as re&s;olutely re&s;i&s;ted, till Col. <HI>WASHINGTON</HI> gained the out works, and made a breach in the wall."</P></NOTE> Strong powers of mind, a good private educa|tion,

and a robu&s;t con&s;titution fitted him very early to appear in public life&mdash;and to render important &s;ervices to his country, as well as to give &s;trong pre&s;ages of his future greatne&s;s; even at an age when young gentlemen of fortune are too apt to be rioting in luxury and di&s;&s;ipation. For before he arrived at the age which the laws of his coun|try con&s;ider as manhood, he was delegated by his native Colony to remon&s;trate again&s;t the encroach|ments of the French and Indians on their we&s;tern frontiers. War &s;ucceeding, he was appointed to the command of a provincial regiment in that army, of which <HI>BRADDOCK</HI> was General. There he di&s;covered the force of his genius in warlike affairs, by uniting the ardour and courage of a young man with the penetration and &s;kill of a vet|eran &s;oldier. He remon&s;trated with his com|mander again&s;t the arrangments of the battle; and when he could not convince that ob&s;tinate man, who fell a de&s;erved &s;acrifice to his pre&s;umption and ignorance, the great WASHINGTON, at twenty-two years of age, covered and protected the retreating army. Such were the hopes excit|ed by his abilities and virtue, that even then he was de&s;ignated in prophetic language to be the future &s;aviour of America. The&s;e were exploits &s;ufficient for the morning of a brilliant life, and
<PB N="9" REF="038622_0008_1012A9744A782530">
enough to have procured him an honourable name on the hi&s;torick page. Yet they are lo&s;t by the contemplation of the numerous and more impor|tant events which &s;ucceeded.&mdash;As the&s;e are more intere&s;ting, let us follow him in his career.</P>
<P>HAVING gone through the &s;everal grades of Legi&s;lator and Magi&s;trate in his native province, he was appointed in 1774, a Delegate to the Gen|eral Congre&s;s. He &s;incerely joined with that hon|ourable band of Patriots, in every effort to re&s;tore the violated rights of his country, without a civil war. But their attempts were fruitle&s;s. The more humbly they petitioned, the more haughti|ly they were rejected by the Government of Great Britain. At length, when all other re&s;ources fail|ed, an appeal was made to Heaven, to be decided by the &s;word. At that time, America was with|out arms, amunition, money, or publick credit. No incon&s;iderable proportion of her citizens be|came her avowed enemies. The&s;e, from the in|fluence of the royal governors, were, many of them, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of publick offices, and had great con&s;e|quence and con&s;ideration in &s;ociety. Though the people at large were united, yet numerous con|tingences might have de&s;troyed an alliance pro|duced by common danger.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="038622_0009_1012A975D9FFE628">THE nation, with whom we contended, com|manded an exten&s;ive revenue and an unlimited credit; abounding in military re&s;ources. The re|cent triumphs of her arms in Europe and Amer|ica, had been heard by all, and witne&s;&s;ed by no incon&s;iderable proportion of the world. She &s;ent over generals to command her armies, who had been flu&s;hed with conque&s;t; and a navy&mdash;the terror of all maritime powers. She directed her in&s;truments of vengeance and death to de&s;troy property and life, as far as each might be nece&s;&s;ary to reduce us to unqualified &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. In this &s;tate of uni|ver&s;al anxiety and di&s;may, the attention and re|maining hopes of Congre&s;s were directed to our departed FATHER; by their unanimous &s;uffra|ges, he was cho&s;en CAPTAIN GENERAL of the armies of the United States. It was then in the day of your calamity, that he abandoned ev|ery dome&s;tick comfort&mdash;left the enjoyment of an opulent fortune, and expo&s;ed his precious and va|luable life, that he might defend your cau&s;e and e&s;tabli&s;h your independence. With indu&s;try, he di&s;ciplined your armies; with prudence, he con|cealed your weakne&s;s, not only from your ene|mies, but from your&s;elves. With equal &s;kill and fortitude (under the &s;miles of Heaven) he drove the Briti&s;h forces from yonder city.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="038622_0010_1012A97C9FAE2738">SHALL we retro&s;pect this illu&s;trious MAN in his retreat through the Jer&s;ies, like another <HI>Eneas,</HI> carrying with him the hopes and fortunes of his country? Great and venerable in adver&s;ity, he was him&s;elf an ho&s;t. Though by &s;ickne&s;s and ill &s;ucce&s;s, our army was nearly annihilated; yet while WASHINGTON lived, it was accounted criminal to de&s;pair of the Commonwealth.&mdash;Ye war-worn veterans, who&s;e aged heads are covered with the "blo&s;&s;oms of the grave," &s;peak, for you can tell! You, who have &s;o often followed and attended this wonderful MAN through the vici&s;i|tudes of the late revolution, and to who&s;e co-ope|rating valour we are indebted for our <HI>Liberty</HI> and <HI>Independence.</HI> How dauntle&s;s and unappalled in the mid&s;t of &s;urrounding dangers! How often hath he wa&s;ted the midnight lamp in planning for your and our &s;afety! As you have &s;een his fortitude under the &s;evere&s;t &s;hocks of fortune; &s;o have you known his humanity after &s;ucce&s;s. The vanqui&s;hed found in him, not an implacable victor, but a generous and &s;ympathizing friend. What attention and kindne&s;s did he not di&s;play to the brave compan|ions of his danger? He bled for your wounds; and, like the Emperor Trajan, was ready to tear his garments, that he might bind them up. Was

there one of your number, who was not willing to die fighting under his banner? or who would not have coveted the &s;acrifice of his own life to protect that of his General? In a word, who did not &s;ubmit to his commands from motives of af|fection, rather than fear?</P>
<P>AT the clo&s;e of the late war, when murmurs for <HI>unrewarded &s;ervices</HI> and <HI>cruelly neglected merits</HI> had pervaded the camps, and nearly introduced a civil war, the powerful influence of this invariable FRIEND to his country, like the fabled vi&s;age and a&s;cen&s;ions of the Monarch of the Ocean, calmed the &s;torm, quenched the torch of di&s;cord, and &s;aid to the impetuous pa&s;&s;ions "peace be &s;till."</P>
<P>BY the gracious interpo&s;ition of Almighty God, the war with Britain was brought to a favourable i&s;&s;ue, and the national &s;overeignty of America was acknowledged by her enemies. This great man did then retire to dome&s;tic occupation&mdash;like the famous Dictator <HI>Cincinnatus.</HI> He &s;ought in the &s;hades of private life the ble&s;&s;ings for which he had contended with &s;ucce&s;s, taking at the &s;ame time a farewell of all public honours and employ|ments.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="038622_0012_1012A98018987E58">BUT had he not now done enough for his coun|try? Was he not crowned with unwithering laurels? Was not the orb of his glory full? Enough it may be an&s;wered for any other hero or &s;tate&s;man. But yet from our illu&s;trious PARENT immortal &s;ervices were to be performed in a mortal life. It was not only nece&s;&s;ary that he &s;hould lay the foundations, but that he &s;hould complete the &s;uper&s;tructure of LIBERTY in the&s;e American regions.&mdash;In the year 1787, he was &s;ent as a delegate to a Convention, convoked under the au|thority of the &s;everal &s;tates in the union, to form a general con&s;titution. That body of &s;ages cho&s;e him to pre&s;ide in their a&s;&s;embly. When this &s;y&s;|tem was adopted, the univer&s;al wi&s;hes and &s;uffrages of the people created him their &s;upreme political head. To any other man but GEORGE WASHINGTON, this exalted &s;tation would have been the highe&s;t object of ambition. But when it is con&s;idered that he had already acquired the univer&s;al good will of his country, and a repu|tation which could &s;carcely be increa&s;ed, obedi|ence to the voice of his fellow-citizens, was a &s;a|crifice,&mdash;yea, a &s;acrifice which added to the num|ber of our obligations to his memory, for it de|mon&s;trated that he was not only willing to expo&s;e his life, but even hazard his fame, when the &s;acred
<PB N="14" REF="038622_0013_1012A98446F5AD60">
calls of duty and the publick nece&s;&s;ity demanded it at his hands.</P>
<P>HOW wi&s;ely he a&s;&s;i&s;ted in organizing this go|vernment, in reconciling contending parties, in guarding again&s;t foreign influence, in pre&s;erving our neutrality, and finally in performing the diffi|cult and arduous duties of his exalted &s;tation, I &s;hall leave to be recorded by &s;ome future hi&s;torian, and properly tran&s;mitted to the important tribunal of po&s;terity.&mdash;Thus much it is proper to ob&s;erve, that though very different apprehen&s;ions were formed of the events of that day; yet all great and good men who differed from our Pre&s;ident in his political admini&s;tration, reverenced the pu|rity of his motives, and rectitude of his heart.</P>
<P>WHEN eight years of his valuable and impor|tant life had been devoted to the intere&s;ts of his native land&mdash;when different parties were in &s;ome mea&s;ure compo&s;ed, and the government &s;trengthened by time and habit, and the acce&s;&s;ion of all the &s;tates, he quitted his high and exalted &s;tation, with more plea&s;ure than it would have been received by the mo&s;t &s;anguine votary of ambition and power.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="038622_0014_1012A9872AECAD90">NO long interval exi&s;ted from his re&s;ignation of the Pre&s;idency, before he was once more called into publick life. The violent revolutions in Eu|rope, threatening America with the danger of a war&mdash;he accepted the command of our army, in a rank inferior to what he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed before. This elevation of &s;oul, &s;uperior to all common notions of grandeur, reminds us of the old vener|able Roman, who when he had gone through all the publick grades of office, fought as a private under his own &s;on when Con&s;ul.</P>
<P>THUS honourable, thus truly u&s;eful and emin|ently great, was our beloved PARENT in his publick character.&mdash;Thus gloriou&s;ly did he di&s;charge every duty in peace and war, which his country a&s;&s;igned him. We &s;hould do criminal inju&s;tice not only to his memory, but to &s;ociety, were we here to clo&s;e, and omit to declare his private virtues, as an example for the world. This part of the pic|ture is by no means unimportant; for his amiable qualities when properly exhibited, may be as much more u&s;eful than tho&s;e of an ob&s;cure citizen, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the &s;ame mea&s;ures of moral and &s;ocial virtue, as his name and influence is more exten|&s;ive.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="038622_0015_1012A988B978BCF0">THOUGH po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;plendid fortune, he did not feel him&s;elf rai&s;ed above the duties of indu&s;try, and the common calls of private life. He ob&s;erved &s;uch method and order in the management of his affairs, that notwith&s;tanding his repeated liberal do|nations, and princely ho&s;pitality, he greatly en|crea&s;ed his paternal e&s;tate. As a hu&s;band, he was &s;uch an example of con&s;tancy and tender affec|tions, as proved that the <HI>amiable</HI> may be united with the <HI>&s;ublime,</HI> in the moral character. As a ma&s;ter, he united dignity and authority with &s;uch mildne&s;s of temper, as procured prompt obedience and warm attachment. And it is worthy of re|mark, that in all the important &s;cenes he hath pa&s;&s;ed through, and the high tru&s;ts he was obliged to repo&s;e on the fidelity of his attendants, that there never hath appeared an in&s;tance of treachery in any member of his family. While this demon|&s;trates his penetration and in&s;ight of human na|ture&mdash;it evidences the excellency of his heart and manners, in thus commanding the good affections and e&s;teem of all degrees of men. Far from con|&s;idering the brilliancy of his publick character as a mantle for his private vices, he was uniformly cor|rect. His manners were affable, but dignified. In a word, &s;uch was his attention to decorum and
<PB N="17" REF="038622_0016_1012A98CE49645A0">
propriety, that no man dared to profane his feel|ings by vicious or indecent conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>IN this age of infidelity and licentiou&s;ne&s;s, he was not a&s;hamed to avow and honour the &s;y&s;tem of Chri&s;tianity. He frequently attended its publick in&s;titutions, and in his la&s;t addre&s;s has warmly re|commended religion to the notice of his fellow-citizens.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t authenticated act of his life was wor|thy of him&s;elf. In his la&s;t will and te&s;tament, be|&s;ides having be&s;towed large &s;ums for the encourage|ment of literature and publick utility, he hath lib|erated all the Africans who belonged to his e&s;|tate. He was obliged to po&s;tpone his noble and generous de&s;ign during his life, on account of the &s;ituation of the &s;outhern &s;tates. Yet he took care to furni&s;h tho&s;e men with &s;uch in&s;tructions, as would qualify them for freedom, and hath made pro|vi&s;ion for the &s;upport of the old and infirm, as a com|pen&s;ation for their pa&s;t labours. Thus <HI>uniform</HI> in all his conduct, was this FRIEND of the <HI>Rights of Mankind</HI>&mdash;thus con&s;i&s;tent, were his <HI>Republican Principles.</HI></P>
<P>A SUMMARY review of the character of this
<PB N="18" REF="038622_0017_1012A98FC887DA68">
great MAN, will afford &s;ufficient rea&s;ons for the applau&s;es which his country hath be&s;towed on his actions, and the uncommon honours which have been paid to his memory.</P>
<P>HAD any one, &s;killed in military affairs, beheld him forming and di&s;ciplining his army&mdash;perform|ing the mo&s;t arduous enterprizes, executing all the duties of a con&s;ummate general, &s;ubduing the proud and expre&s;&s;ing humanity to the vanqui&s;hed, he would have concluded that WASHINGTON mu&s;t have been born in a camp, and warlike glory had been his only pur&s;uit. Was our illu&s;|trious CHIEF to have been viewed as a &s;tate&s;man, a lawgiver and pre&s;ident&mdash;the inference would have been that his highe&s;t ambition was to be a &s;age and patriot&mdash;and that his whole employ|ment was political &s;tudies.</P>
<P>HAD a philo&s;opher viewed the undeviating purity of his morals&mdash;and the elevation and mag|nanimity of his mind in receiving the highe&s;t honours and plaudits ever given to mere man, without the lea&s;t token of in&s;olence or vanity; would he not have tran&s;ported him&s;elf in idea to Athens&mdash;and imagined that WASHINGTON, in the Grove of Plato, had learned to &s;ubdue all

pa&s;&s;ions, ri&s;e above all &s;ublunary grandeur, and to place his whole happine&s;s in intellectual plea&s;ures and the cultivation of his &s;oul!</P>
<P>THOUGH we doubt not, other Generals have been equally brave in the field, conducted equally difficult enterprizes, and made more &s;plendid con|que&s;ts; other Patriots and Sages have had an equal affection for their country, and have been ready to devote their talents to pre&s;erve, or die to de|fend its liberties; and other private citizens have e|qualled him in moral and &s;ocial duties: yet, where is the man (the in&s;pired characters recorded in the holy &s;criptures excepted) who hath united in him|&s;elf &s;uch mea&s;ures of military, political and moral excellence? We &s;hould do inju&s;tice by comparing him with any one exalted name which hath been celebrated through the world.
