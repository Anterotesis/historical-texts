<L>For many years, 'till time work'd something new.</L>
<L>One ev'ning, standing at my wicket gate,</L>
<L>I saw a sail, in which I tried my fate;</L>

<L>'Till by degrees his former dwelling rose</L>

When, suddenly, the anxious servant spoke,</L>

<L>Upstairs they went, the sick man heard their feet,</L>
<L>And rais'd his head, their eager eyes to meet:</L>
