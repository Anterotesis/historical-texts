<P>THE lot of no mortal is more enviable than that of the man who, after having by virtuous in|du&s;try acquired a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for him|&s;elf and his family, now is &s;itting down to a frugal &s;upper between a beloved wife and a hopeful boy, cheered by the &s;weet con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having per|formed his duty, while his darlings alternately ki&s;s

<P>Do not &s;mile contemptuou&s;ly, you obedient &s;laves of female caprice; I am not &s;peaking to you, ye pitiful beings who have no fixed object in view, and have neither a heart nor a &s;oul. Do not &s;cold, ye du&s;ty pedants whom the &s;un of learning has parched up &s;o much as to re&s;emble the di&s;mal print that figures on the title-page of your worm-eaten books: I am &s;peaking to thee, venerable man, who art faithful to the golden medium; who nei|ther hurrie&s;t from nothing to nothing, nor con|&s;tantly wa&s;t buried among ru&s;ty folios: for thee, citizen and father, for thee am I going to deline|ate the &s;ub&s;equent picture.</P>
<P>Charles Frederick Ortenberg, head ma&s;ter of the grammar-&s;chool at W**, was &s;itting at nine o'clock in the evening at a table oppo&s;ite to a plate of potatoes. Caroline, a gentle and good-natured creature, &s;at on one &s;ide, and William, a lovely boy, who was &s;even years old, who&s;e eyes be&s;poke a &s;ound mind, and who&s;e ro&s;y cheeks were graced with the &s;weet &s;mile of innocence, &s;at at the other.</P>
<P>No &s;pice of the Indies di&s;graced the home|grown potatoes. Fre&s;h butter and &s;alt, and, by way ef de&s;ert, a plate full of golden pippins, pealed by Caroline's hands, and &s;weetened by Caroline's &s;miles&mdash;the&s;e were the rural dainties which left no wi&s;h for the temperate palate of the &s;mall ami|able family.</P>
<P>The cloth was removed. Ortenberg undre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, while mother and &s;on a&s;&s;i&s;ted him with cheerful alacrity. William fetched a lighted can|dle; Ortenberg flung him&s;elf into an ea&s;y chair, and emptied his pipe again&s;t the corner of the &s;tove; Caroline fa&s;tened her needle-work to a ta|ble covered with green oil-cloth; William hold|ing Gellert's fables under his arm, &s;trove to get

upon a chair that &s;tood by her &s;ide, and an old faith|ful maid-&s;ervant, the only dome&s;tic of this humble family, &s;at near the &s;tove, behind the &s;pinning-wheel&mdash;This was the &s;weet moment in which Ortenberg was wont to enjoy his dome&s;tic happi|ne&s;s, while he conver&s;ed with his wife of the num|berle&s;s trials through which they had acquired their pre&s;ent contentment, and delineated a plan for the education of their little family, which he hoped to &s;ee &s;oon increa&s;e. Heavens! how panted the heart of the happy parents, when they looked upon William as the &s;upport of their old age; how many a &s;weet hour was dreamed away in this manner! Deluded mortals! why did fate not re|ali&s;e your innocent dreams? Why are the joys of this world like the rays of the moon in a wild, tempe&s;tuous night, when her &s;ilver orb is eclip&s;ed every moment by the fleeting clouds; like the &s;leep of a &s;ick per&s;on, who, after a few minutes of re&s;t, awakes to be tormented by new agonies; like the warm breath of the &s;un in April, which melts the &s;now that &s;hrouds the early flower, which is on the point of unfolding it&s;elf with congenial warmth, and is buried in a few hours under the load of a de&s;tructive &s;hower of hail? The humble&s;t happine&s;s remains not unenvied; the mo&s;t &s;eclu|ded contentment is liable to be di&s;turbed!</P>
<P>That evening was, as u&s;ual, de&s;igned for a &s;weet chat of an happy futurity and peaceful old age; when hone&s;t Conrad &s;uddenly ru&s;hed into the a|partment, with a vi&s;ible and uncommon anxiety, and gave Ortenberg a &s;ealed note.</P>
<P>"What is the matter with you, hone&s;t Conrad?" &s;aid Ortenberg, ca&s;ting an anxious look at his pregnant wife. Conrad would not &s;peak, nor had he the power:&mdash;mute, and with wild looks; he pointed at the note and di&s;appeared.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="037761_0005_100F047D0D7A12C0">
Caroline turned pale; her &s;oul forebode mis|fortune; her trembling hand dropt her work on the table: &s;he &s;tarted up, &s;upporting her&s;elf by her &s;on's chair, and gazed with anxious and &s;crutini|zing looks at her hu&s;band, who &s;till held the note unopened in his hand.</P>
<P>Ortenberg po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a great &s;hare of firmne&s;s and pre&s;ence of mind. The mute di&s;tre&s;s of old Con|rad; his &s;trange and &s;udden di&s;appearance; the manner in which he had delivered the note&mdash;a lan|guage of which Conrad, hitherto, never had made u&s;e&mdash;all this made him apprehen&s;ive that &s;ome portentious thunder-cloud was hanging over his head. Caroline's nerves were weak, and &s;he was, be&s;ides, far advanced in her pregnancy. A mo&s;t perplexing &s;ituation. A &s;udden terror would have been mortal poi&s;on to her.</P>
<P>Ortenberg's re&s;olution was taken. "Command your mu&s;cles," he &s;aid to him&s;elf: "whatever be the contents of the note, let not your countenance betray its purport."</P>
<P>"What is the matter, dear Caroline? &s;aid he to his wife, when he beheld the palene&s;s of her face, and &s;aw her hand tremble.</P>
<P>"The note&mdash;" replied Caroline, &s;tammering, (with a forced &s;mile).</P>
<P>Has then that note &s;uch a terrible appearance? (&s;upplicating) Dear Caroline, con&s;ider in what a &s;ituation you are. Is it fit you &s;hould tremble at the ru&s;tling of a leaf?"</P>

<P>Is nothing new to you. Conrad is old; old people are like children, they mi&s;take a dog for a lion. Do you recollect how much ter|ror his countenance expre&s;&s;ed la&s;t autumn, when he came running into the apartment, to tell us that the pear-tree had been robbed?</P>

<P><STAGE>(&s;omewhat vexed)</STAGE> Dear Ortenberg, you mu&s;t think your&s;elf, that the note contains &s;ome bad news, el&s;e you would not &s;o long have delayed opening it.</P>
</SP>
<P>"If this be your opinion," replied Ortenberg, with &s;eeming tranquillity, "I will open it in&s;tant|ly." He recollected the re&s;olution he had taken, and broke the &s;eal. Caroline's &s;crutinizing and portending eyes watched his countenance; howe|ver, the brow of the re&s;olute man di&s;played not even a &s;ingle furrow. Yet he did not act exactly, in that critical moment, as he, perhaps, ought to have done. My readers &s;hall know in proper time, what the mi&s;terious note contained. The lament|able con&s;equences of this note, or rather the man|ner in which Ortenberg conducted him&s;elf on this occa&s;ion, will, perhaps, irritate many of my rea|ders again&s;t him. However, we ought never to judge of an action, which was committed in a &s;itu|ation which we have never experienced. Orten|berg's life depended in &s;ome degree on this note; Caroline's life was as dear to him as his own; the in&s;tinct of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation and fervent love came, in colli&s;ion; Ortenberg wanted to &s;atisfy both, wanted to &s;ave him&s;elf, and to &s;pare his wife; two objects, which to attain jointly was very difficult, or, perhaps, impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>"What o'clock is it?" he &s;aid, after he had read the note, looking at his watch. "Half an hour pa&s;t nine o'clock. I mu&s;t go out." He pul|led off his night-gown, and wrapped him&s;elf in a grey roquelor.</P>
<P>"For God's &s;ake!" exclaimed Caroline; "what means all this?"</P>
<P>Ortenberg was &s;ilent.</P>

<P>You want to &s;pare me, and do not con&s;ider that our imagination heightens the danger the more, the le&s;s we can gue&s;s the real object of our misfortune. You torment me! the misfortune which you conceal from me, cannot be half &s;o dreadful as my apprehen&s;ion repre&s;ents it.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ortenberg.</SPEAKER>
<P>How can you talk of misfortunes? You are very &s;ingular, dear Caroline; be ea&s;y! the note concerns old Conrad. He conjures me to keep its contents &s;ecret, and Caroline has hither|to, always been &s;o di&s;creet as to wring no &s;ecrets from me.</P>
</SP>
<P>Having &s;aid this, he went to his &s;tudy, where he threw him&s;elf down upon his knees, and im|plored God to give him courage and firmne&s;s, put &s;ome Frederic-d'ors in his pur&s;e, and went down &s;tairs again to fetch his hat and cane. Caroline, who had been intimidated by his last reply, and &s;eriou&s;ly began to believe that the whole affair con|cerned only old Conrad, &s;urveyed him &s;ilently. He &s;till maintained the victory, but&mdash;when he was going&mdash;to quit, perhpas for ever his pregnant wife and a helple&s;s child&mdash;to leave them without a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance, and abandon them to the power of a volup|tuous villain of rank&mdash;nature &s;uddenly conqured. He took the bru&s;h from the harp&s;ichord, bru&s;hing his hat thrice, to gain time to try whether it would not be po&s;&s;ible for him to regain his fortitude. But alas! he tried in vain! breathed with difficulty; a &s;igh e&s;caped his breath, and Caroline's anxiety

returned with aditional force. He cro&s;&s;ed the ap|partment &s;everal times; Caroline's perplexed eyes followed his &s;teps. He was &s;ilent; Caroline was &s;ilent&mdash;a dreadful &s;tillne&s;s! He half opened the door; he felt as if he were going from his apart|ment to the grave; his recollection for&s;ook him. He ru&s;hed &s;uddenly into the arms of his wife; a torrent of tears, which he had in vain endeavoured to re&s;train, broke from his eyes. "Farewel, my Caroline!" was all he was able to utter; but that was &s;ufficient to deprive his wife of the u&s;e of her &s;en&s;es; &s;he &s;unk fainting upon a chair. "God!" exclaimed Ortenberg, with bitter angui&s;h, "God, again&s;t whom I never knowingly offended? be thou the protector of that generous and inno|cent &s;oul." He called for the &s;ervant, to a&s;&s;i&s;t Caroline, imprinted a tearful ki&s;s upon the lips of his &s;on, who was ju&s;t going to read Gellert's af|fecting tale of Rhin&s;olt and Lucia, and ru&s;hed &s;en&s;ele&s;s out of the hou&s;e.</P>

<P>ORTENBERG's hou&s;e &s;tood de&s;olated in the &s;uburbs, at the bottom of a narrow &s;treet; behind it was a large orchard and kitchen-garden, from which a gate opened into the fields. The neigh|bouring
<PB N="10" REF="037761_0009_100F0485A03408A8">
hou&s;es, which were half in ruins, were &s;cantily inhabited. The &s;ervant could not leave her mi&s;tre&s;s alone, to call the phy&s;ician. However, Caroline's dangerous &s;ituation naturally produced the wi&s;h to be joined by human beings, no matter who they were. She recollected, that an old captain, who was on half-pay, lived in the &s;e|cond floor and ran in&s;tantly up &s;tairs, to call him down. I &s;hall attempt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o draw the picture of this venerable old man, who was on the verge of his &s;eventieth year.</P>
<P>The captain was a man who had &s;erved from his twelfth year. His whole &s;oul was devoted entirely to his profe&s;&s;ion, and he ri&s;ked his life cheerfully for God and his King. A cannon-ball which &s;hat|tered his left leg, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ad made him an invalid. He did not, however care much for it, and could have engaged to run for a wager, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his wooden leg, again&s;t any young gentleman who wore narrow &s;hoes. He reluctantly took leave of his grenadiers, who loved him like a father; how|ever, a certain petty prince wanted, ju&s;t at that time, to make a provi&s;ion for one of his natural children, and the old brave captain was compelled to con&s;ent to be declared unfit for further &s;ervice, although he &s;hould have received only a &s;ingle grain of &s;mall-&s;hot in the calf of his leg. A &s;canty pen&s;ion was the only reward of fifty years' hard and faithful &s;ervices. He was, however, never heard to complain. "Brown bread," he u&s;ed fre|quently to &s;ay, "&s;atisfies the cravings of the &s;tomach, and &s;mall beer allays thir&s;t. A man who has more than he wants, and gives not the re&s;t to his poor neighbours, does not de&s;erve to have as much as he wants, however little that may be. Has the King a better appetite than my&s;elf? Is he happier than I am? Does he &s;leep better than I do?"</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="037761_0010_100F04872CB2BBD8">
"Well then!" he &s;ometimes exclaimed with a kind of enthu&s;ia&s;m: "well then, thou wooden &s;upporter, faithful companion of my &s;ound limb, I am &s;atisfied with thee! my lips are maid to command and unaccu&s;tomed to complaints. A cripple lives unenvied, and a man who is not ex|po&s;ed to envy, lives happy." The&s;e few words compri&s;ed the whole philo&s;ophy of the brave veteran.</P>
<P>He was content to have only &s;o much to &s;pare as would enable him to purcha&s;e the Life of Prince Eugene, or the Theatre of State. He loved to talk of the campaigns which he had made, and this was one of tho&s;e weakne&s;&s;es in which we mu&s;t indulge our&s;elves in old age. His fondne&s;s of familiar chat led him frequently down &s;tairs to Ortenberg, in long winter evenings, when he u&s;ed to delineate the po&s;itions of the two armies on the field of battle, with chalk upon the table, and at la&s;t, with heartfelt joys, always made a &s;troke through the ho&s;tile &s;quadrons, to &s;ignify that they had been defeated. Ortenberg was ever willing to li&s;ten patiently to the good old man. Caroline too applauded him &s;ometimes by a &s;mile, and thus both had gained his love in &s;uch a high degree, that he, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, would cheerfully have &s;acrificed his other leg for them. When no per&s;on was near to whom he could talk, he u&s;ed to conver&s;e with him&s;elf, and &s;hape the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es regularly, in the form of que&s;tion and an&s;wer. For in&s;tance:</P>
<P>"Captain Storm, (this was his name,) were you at the battle of Dettingen?"</P>
<P>Undoubtedly!</P>
<P>"Did you fight well?"</P>
<P>The duce take it! there was no opportunity to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight. Our regiment was expo&s;ed five hours to the fire of the artillery, and that was all. They

dropt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> like flies, before, behind, and near me. God pre&s;erved my life.</P>
<P>"Captain Storm," what do you think of the battle of Dettingen?"</P>
<P>I think it was a &s;candalous bu&s;ine&s;s: I am, in|deed, not the the la&s;t, if the enemy face me fairly. However, to &s;tand five hours, and to &s;uffer tamely to be &s;hot at among&s;t mangled bodies, groaning friends, bloody and &s;hattered corp&s;es, to read the agony of death in the eyes of the dying, to &s;ee how one after the other breathes his la&s;t&mdash;no, by God, thus will I not be treated!</P>
<P>"Thus will I not be treated" was the favourite expre&s;&s;ion, which he applied on all occa&s;ions.&mdash;We hope, our readers now know him &s;ufficiently.</P>
<P>He was ju&s;t going to a&s;&s;i&s;t Duke Bernhard of Weymar, in be&s;ieging Bri&s;ach, and bombarded the town with uncommon violence, when Ca|roline's maid entered his apartment.</P>
<P>"Captain! for God's &s;ake! exclaimed the &s;er|vant out of breath, "I conjure you to come in|&s;tantly to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance; el&s;e &s;he will be lo&s;t!"</P>

</SP>
<P>Having ejaculated the&s;e words, &s;he ru&s;hed out of the apartment.</P>
<P>The Captain no &s;ooner under&s;tood what &s;he meant, than the &s;iege of Bai&s;ach was rai&s;ed. He fa&s;tened his green night-gown with his belt, took his medicine-che&s;t under his arm, and hobbled down &s;tairs as fa&s;t as his wooden leg would per|mit. Captain Storm, whither art thou going?" &s;aid he to him&s;elf on the way.</P>
<P>I am going to a&s;&s;i&s;t Mrs. Ortenberg, for the wench &s;ays &s;he has fainted away, and no one is at

hand to give her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Yes, I am coming, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the poor woman! repeated he on every &s;tep, dragging his left leg after him. Fre&s;h troops! forced marches! the &s;uccours are at the gate.</P>
<P>Caroline ju&s;t opened her eyes, when he entered her apartment.</P>
<P>"What the deuce, madam, are you about!" (he &s;urveyed the apartment) "you &s;eem to have been defeated; however, the field of battle is evacuat|ed.</P>

<P>Dear Madam! for God's &s;ake don't turu &s;o pale!</P>
<P>He put his medicine-che&s;t upon the table, took a gla&s;s of tincture of rhubarb out, and held it un|der her no&s;e; ran up and down the room with the mo&s;t anxious activity, poured &s;pirit of hart&s;horn in a &s;poon, and fortunately, &s;pilled it before he reached Caroline's chair.

<P>Having fini&s;hed this elaborate harangue, he took Ortenberg's pipe from the table, whi&s;tling the march of his regiment, and filled it with the de|termined look of a man who is ready to attack
<PB N="16" REF="037761_0015_100F049262813C98">
the very gates of hell, and to challenge all its in|fernal inhabitants.</P>
<P>Caroline flung her&s;elf in &s;peechle&s;s agony in an arm chair. The old &s;oldier mi&s;took this for a mark of returning tranquillity, which he imputed to the force of his con&s;olatory arguments. He lighted his pipe with an air of &s;atisfaction, and marched up and down the apartment, wheeling always regularly round. If he had known a lit|tle more of phy&s;iognomy, he would ea&s;ily have been able to read Caroline's agony in her counte|nance. But knowing of no other danger, but that which the enemy's batteries threatened, and of no other means of defence but &s;words, guns, and pi&s;tols, he had not the lea&s;t idea, that a per&s;on can quietly &s;it in an arm-chair, and yet be torn by the mo&s;t agonizing apprehen&s;ions. He had, be&s;ides, adopted the maxim, that the devil is not always dreadful, if we have courage enough to look at him. He reflected therefore no longer on what had happened, or might happen, and without en|tering into an u&s;ele&s;s examination of the cau&s;e of Ortenberg's ab&s;ence, &s;at quietly down, chalked the plan of Brei&s;ach upon the table, and began to cannonade the fortre&s;s, in the name of Duke Bernhard, in all directions.</P>
<P>William had laid both arms upon the table, and his head upon them, and was fa&s;t a&s;leep. This inactive &s;tillne&s;s tended very little to re&s;tore peace to Caroline's agitated mind. The melancholy &s;ilence la&s;ted &s;ome time, and was interrupted by nothing but Caroline's &s;ighs; by the noi&s;e which the old captain made in chalking upon the table: by William's &s;noaring, the chirruping of a cricket in the chimney, and the howling of a dog in the &s;treet.&mdash;The clock &s;truck twelve, and &s;till no in|telligence of Ortenberg. Caroline's agony in|crea&s;ed vi&s;ibly; one tear after the other gu&s;hed
<PB N="17" REF="037761_0016_100F04948D0CA708">
over her cheeks. But they were not tho&s;e &s;alu|tary tears, that kind gift of nature, by which the heart is unburthened and animated with &s;trength to bear new grief. There is a kind of weeping, which is not attended with &s;obbing and wringing of hands; but, during which, the tears &s;tart &s;ingly from our eyes, to let us ta&s;te the bitterne&s;s of every &s;olitary drop that &s;teals down our cheeks. Thus, Caroline wept.</P>
<P>The captain perceived it at la&s;t; however he had exhau&s;ted his arguments of con&s;olation. He went to the window, and &s;ung with cordial devo|tion the hymn "Ble&s;&s;ed is the man who tru&s;ts in God;" and, when he had fini&s;hed, he acciden|tally ca&s;t his eyes on the con&s;tellation Orion, and forgot his friend Ortenberg, the &s;uffering Caro|line, and the whole world, in a moment. When he formerly went out reconnoitering, that con&s;tel|lation always &s;erved him as a guide, for which rea&s;on he could never behold it without &s;enti|ments of the mo&s;t heartfelt joy. When he once began to think of reconnoitering, he always thought of the camp; and when his thoughts once were in the camp, no clap of thunder could rou&s;e him, unle&s;s he &s;hould have mi&s;taken it for the report of a cannon.</P>
<P>"Captain Storm!" u&s;ed he to &s;ay to him&s;elf, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, while he contemplated the con|&s;tellation with cheerful eyes: "Captain Storm! have you frequently been out reconnoitering? un|doubtedly! at night and in fogs, in &s;torm and rain, hungry and thir&s;ty. All was alike to me. It is, indeed, not like a party of plea&s;ure. A &s;kirmi&s;h every moment, and I hate &s;kirmi&s;hing. Upon my poor &s;oul, I would rather have three battles in the open field, than <HI>one</HI> of tho&s;e pickerings, in which they mix pell-mell like ants&mdash;A &s;hot in front, a cut behind, a thru&s;t in the &s;ide.

is a lo&s;t man, if he have no more than two eyes in his head, and be not protected by the angel of God. God has &s;ent his angel to guard me!"</P>
<P>He uncovered his head, looked up to Orion, and adored his heavenly pre&s;erver in grateful &s;i|lence. He covered his head again after a &s;hort pau&s;e.</P>
<P>"Captain Storm, had you not a brave corporal?</P>
<P>"Indeed, I had. His name was Reiter. He was as rough as his whi&s;kers, and as hone&s;t as a Pomeranian. He &s;aved my life twice. Corporal Reiter! u&s;ed I to &s;ay to him, when I &s;hall be old and you too &s;hall be an old man, and neither you nor I can fight any longer for our king, you &s;hall live with Captain Storm. You &s;hall not want for bread while Captain Storm has a mor&s;el to give. Corporal Reiter has run over to the heavenly bands thirteen years &s;ince. The commanding an|gel knows nothing of the &s;ervice, if he has not made him a major." He uncovered his head again and looked up to the con&s;tellation Orion. "Major Reiter!" exclaimed he with great emo|tion: do you think &s;ometimes of your old bro|ther &s;oldier, Captain Storm?"</P>
<P>The &s;ervant who in the mean time, had left the apartment, to get the tea ready, came &s;udden|ly in the room and reported in fearful accents, that &s;he had heard a noi&s;e at the garden gate, and confu&s;ed murmurs, as if many people were &s;tanding before it. Caroline turned pale; the old &s;oldier &s;tared a moment at the &s;ervant, and recol|lected &s;uddenly <HI>where</HI> he was and for <HI>what pur|pose</HI> he was there.</P>
<P>"To arms! Captain!" exclaimed he: "we &s;hall have an action at la&s;t!" With the&s;e words he &s;tumbled out of the door, a&s;king him&s;elf, as u&s;ual, while he limped up &s;tairs: "Captain Storm, whither art thou going?"</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="037761_0018_100ED4CC52780700">
"I am going to prepare my&s;elf for action, the alarm is given, the whole camp is in motion; we are indifferently fortified, and the enemy is at the gate. However I will let them know that I am an old veteran. Call to arms! give the pa|role: God and the ju&s;t cau&s;e!"</P>
<P>He returned after a few minutes with a brace of pi&s;tols under his right arm, and an enormous &s;word in his left hand.</P>
<P>"Let them come on!" he exclaimed with a wild laugh.</P>
<P>"Make ready! Fire! is a command which I have not yet forgotten. The&s;e pi&s;tols, madam, are excellent; I took them from a Swedi&s;h cui|ra&s;&s;ier; they co&s;t me only a &s;ound cut acro&s;s my face.&mdash;The &s;abre is an inheritance of one of my ance&s;tors, who took it from a Turki&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> at the &s;iege of Belgrade.

You mu&s;t &s;tay with the baggage; for you are an invalid; but you, Hannah, (to the &s;er|vant,) mu&s;t take a &s;pit, and protect the rear. Wheel to the right! March!"</P>
<P>He had already opened the chamber door, when he &s;uddenly called halt! and held the following council of war:</P>
<P>"Am not I a fool to take the field with my army, without knowing whether an enemy is near?&mdash;I ought, at lea&s;t, to di&s;patch &s;ome light troops, to reconnoitre. Hannah, make your re|port once more: who knows what the timid fool has heard?&mdash;A noi&s;e? Why it may have been oc|ca&s;ioned by rats. Murmurs?&mdash;Dogs and cats make a noi&s;e which is very much like it&mdash;How|ever, let us &s;ee what it is! March! we will fall upon the enemy's flank! No quarter! If they be mice or rats, they will not laugh at me! No, up|on my &s;oul, they will not! That &s;py there has alarmed the camp."</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="037761_0019_100F049A1B0396A0">
Caroline was not di&s;po&s;ed to laugh; &s;he trem|bled like an a&s;pen leaf. Her eyes rolled wildly, and her tongue &s;eemed &s;u&s;pended to her palate.</P>
<P>The old captain had, in the mean time, taken his &s;tation in the pa&s;&s;age: Hannah was ordered to keep her&s;elf ready for action; and in this warlike array he advanced towards the gate. He was only a few &s;teps di&s;tant from it, when it moved upon its hinges. It now was thrown wide open, and three muffled up fellows with a dark lanthorn were &s;tanding before him.</P>
<P>"Stop, gentlemen! here is an out-po&s;t!" ex|claimed the captain; "you will not ea&s;ily get away without a &s;kirmi&s;h." He cocked his pi&s;tol with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">reate&s;t calmne&s;s, being firmly determined to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> them pay with their blood for every inch of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>Fortunately the &s;ervant &s;tood at his back with a lamp, which rendered it u&s;ele&s;s for the intruders to &s;hut up the light in their lanthorn. They were irre&s;olute what to do, and all three put their hands upon the hilt of their &s;words.</P>
<P>"Either you or I!" continued the captain: "Ra&s;cals! what do you want?" So &s;aying he advanced two &s;teps, and held his cocked pi&s;tol under the no&s;e of the foremo&s;t. "Who is there?" exclaimed he with a martial voice; "an&s;wer, or I'll blow your brains out."</P>
<P>When a parallel line can be drawn between the mouth of a loaded pi&s;tol and our no&s;e, and we con&s;ider, that only a &s;light pull is wanted, to in|corporate its contents with our brains: when we &s;ee that the finger of a &s;trange hand, is already going to put the ball in motion, and reflect, that the fatal lead may be lodged in a moment, in a place where it ought not to be: then all the&s;e circum&s;tances taken together, po&s;&s;e&s;s a magical charm, to open even the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate lips. The

three &s;trangers, who, hitherto, had not been incli|ned to give any other but a palpable explanation of the motives of their nocturnal vi&s;it, changed their re&s;olution, &s;uddenly: "Sir&mdash;" &s;tammered one of them.</P>
<P>"Take your&s;elves off, gentlemen!" replied the captain, ha&s;tily! "wheel to the left, ye caitiffs, or, by our Lord, I'll make you caper like a cannon|ball. Captain Storm is not u&s;ed to neglect his po&s;t. You intend to &s;urpri&s;e our camp; how|ever, your &s;couts informed us of the expedition. It is pity you &s;hould have made your forced march to no purpo&s;e.

Fie! &s;hame! to be put to flight by an old invalid."</P>
<P>Having &s;aid this, he &s;eized the foremo&s;t by the cloak, in order to pu&s;h him and his companions out of the gate. However, the fellow thinking the captain wanted to detain him, left his cloak behind, and took to his heels. His comrades fol|lowed as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, and all three di&s;appeared in a moment.</P>
<P>"Thunder and lightning!" exclaimed the cap|tain, examining the cloak carefully by the light of the lamp, "the fellow was a &s;oldier; I &s;aw plain|ly, that he was dre&s;&s;ed in an uniform.

<Q><L>Ah! were not friend&s;hip in this vale of tears,</L>

<L>And left in &s;torms of fate, without defence!</L></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>CAROLINE leaned on her knees, the pic|ture of de&s;pair. Her eyes rolled wildly in their &s;ockets; her hair &s;tood on end, and her hands &s;eemed convul&s;ive. "My hu&s;band is dead!" This dreadful idea &s;hook the inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of her &s;oul, like concealed fire, which makes the earth quake, and returned every minute with ad|ditional force. "My hu&s;band is dead!" She now, in fancy, &s;aw the dear object of her conju|gal love in the coffin. "My hu&s;band is dead!" She beheld her William and the infant, which &s;he carried under her heart, a prey to hunger and de&s;pair.</P>
<P>"Rejoice, madam," exclaimed the old captain, while he opened the door: "rejoice, the enemy has retreated, and left his baggage behind. (He meant the cloak, which he had hung upon the &s;ervant's &s;pit, and cau&s;ed to be carried before him in triumph). "But, dear madam," continued he, when he &s;aw Caroline &s;truggling with de&s;pair: "this is not the manner in which I expected to be received. I return with &s;poils from the field of battle, and intended to be merry in my winter quarters, and you receive me like an unfledged en&s;ign, who has lo&s;t the colours, and make me &s;ob, as if I had a mu&s;ket-ball in my throat."</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="037761_0022_100F04A06D627FF0">
"I thank you from the bottom of my heart, dear captain&mdash;"</P>
<P>"There is no occa&s;ion for it; I did no more than my duty!"</P>
<P>He laid the cloak, the pi&s;tols, and the &s;word peevi&s;hly upon the table, lighted his pipe again, and &s;tepped &s;ilently to the window, to contemplate the con&s;tellation Orion, to recapitulate his cam|paigns, to devote a tear to corporal Reiter, and to forget, in the&s;e plea&s;ing reveries, the &s;cene of mi&s;ery which was before him. The &s;ervant rela|ted in the mean time to Caroline, every particular of the tran&s;action. She prote&s;ted, that &s;he had been &s;eized with the mo&s;t dreadful apprehen&s;ions, and could not conceive, how the dear old captain could put three daring fellows to flight, without being leagued with old Nick. She concluded with the a&s;&s;ertion, that &s;he was perfectly convin|ced, he was proof again&s;t &s;words and bullets. Neither Caroline nor the captain paid the lea&s;t attention to what &s;he &s;aid; Caroline, becau&s;e her &s;tupifying de&s;pair, prevented her from perceiving any thing be&s;ides the agonies of her mind, and the captain, becau&s;e he was ju&s;t occupied in the &s;iege of Brei&s;ach.</P>
<P>"Merciful God! what can all this mean?" eja|culated Caroline, at la&s;t, after a deep hollow groan: "and where may Ortenberg be?</P>
<P>"Not where he ought to be!" replied the cap|tain ha&s;tily; "el&s;e he would have been here be|fore, and rai&s;ed a dyke again&s;t the&s;e torrents of tears, and not &s;uffer that my poor pipe of tobacco &s;hould be thus imbittered."</P>
<P>Caroline made no reply, folding her handker|chief between her hands, and ca&s;ting her eyes to the ground. No tear &s;tarted from her eyes! but the quick heavings of her bo&s;om, her anxious and &s;hort re&s;piration, plainly indicated the dreadful workings of her mind.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="037761_0023_100F04A43AD64D38">
Thus another leaden hour crept away like a black thunder-cloud, which &s;eems to be fettered with heavy chains to the &s;ky, while the trembling inhabitant of the rural cottage, looks every mo|ment out of the window, to &s;ee whether it has not yet pa&s;&s;ed by: the cock crowed, the ea&s;tern horizon a&s;&s;umed a livelier hue, and announced the approach of day.</P>
<P>"This is no joke!" &s;aid the captain; "I don't like it! I will go, madam, and reconnoitre! I will make a <HI>forced</HI> march; and you &s;hall &s;ee him in an hour's time, either dead or alive."</P>
<P>He &s;tumped up &s;tairs, without waiting for an an&s;wer, dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf with the greate&s;t impetuo|&s;ity, and whi&s;tled the march of his regiment. When he had armed him&s;elf with his cane and &s;word, and, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, with a brace of pock|et-pi&s;tols; he &s;tumped again down&punc; &s;tairs, open|ed Caroline's door, leaning in a martial manner upon his cane, and exclaimed;</P>
<P>"Well, madam, the detachment is ready! &s;hall I march out?"</P>
<P>Caroline replied not.</P>
<P>"Madam," re&s;umed the captain, "cannot mu&s;|ter up a &s;ingle word, the communication is cut off; the allies mu&s;t &s;ee what they can do. Wheel to the right!"</P>
<P>Having &s;aid this, he really made the evolution, &s;tamped with his foot upon the floor that the cups upon the table jingled, pre&s;&s;ed the hat with his cane upon his head, gave the word, March, and left the apartment.</P>
<P>When he came into the &s;treet, he a&s;ked him&s;elf as u&s;ual: "Captain Storm, whither art thou go|ing?&mdash;I am commanded to go in &s;earch of a de|&s;erter, to carry him to the camp, dead or alive.&mdash;God has &s;ent us a fine morning!"

My readers will not be a&s;toni&s;hed to learn, that the battle of Prague made the old veteran forget Ortenberg entirely, and that he &s;tayed with John Miller, until the latter was relieved.</P>
<P>But let us return to Caroline, and her helple&s;s &s;ituation.</P>
<P>We are never entirely mi&s;erable, while &s;ome per&s;on is with us, by who&s;e actions and words we can perceive that he &s;hares our &s;ufferings, although the mind be not in that di&s;po&s;ition which is re|quired, if we are to be &s;en&s;ible of all the marks of &s;ympathy which compa&s;&s;ion di&s;plays, and able to &s;hed a grateful tear. This was Caroline's &s;ituation. While the captain was with her, &s;he &s;hared her agony with him, without knowing it, and fir&s;t grew &s;en&s;ible of it, when he had left her. Till that moment, the flame of tormenting bodings, burned only internally, but, no &s;ooner was her venerable protector gone, than &s;he &s;tarted wildly from her chair, cro&s;&s;ing the appartment with &s;tag|gering &s;teps, and went to the window, to look into the &s;treet. She mi&s;took every &s;tranger, at &s;ome di&s;tance, for Ortenberg. There, he is com|ing! &s;houted her wi&s;hful heart. He came nearer, and her heart always had impo&s;ed upon her eyes. Dreadful were the &s;en&s;ations which convul&s;ed her bo&s;om.&mdash;She went, urged by re&s;tle&s;s anxi|ety, without knowing why, to her hu&s;band's &s;tudy, ca&s;ting her wild looks all around, as if &s;he there awaited the developement of &s;ome my&s;terious event. Ortenberg's night-cap lay on the ground. Caroline was terrified. Her eyes lighted on his picture; &s;he &s;tarted back, left the room, and &s;hut the door with as much violence, as if her hu&s;band's &s;pirit had appeared to her. She was obliged to &s;upport her&s;elf with both hands by the banni&s;ter, in order to be able to return to her apartment.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="037761_0027_100F04ABDE1AF478">
William was &s;till immer&s;ed in a &s;ound and quiet &s;leep. Caroline, with folded arms, &s;tood &s;ome|times oppo&s;ite to him, fixing her eyes on his cheeks, which were tinged with a crim&s;on hue, by the invigorating bal&s;am of &s;leep. "Poor Wil|liam!" groaned &s;he: "this morning you played cheerfully with your father, he rocked you on his knee&mdash;alas! if he &s;hould be dead, you will &s;oon be a fatherle&s;s and motherle&s;s orphan."</P>
<P>She was long ab&s;orpt in melancholy contempla|tions, until &s;he &s;uddenly awoke, as if from a pro|found dream, and was going to call for the &s;ervant, to undre&s;s the boy and carry him to bed. How|ever &s;he was &s;o totally deprived, by her agony, of the u&s;e of all her &s;en&s;es, as to be unable to utter a &s;ingle word.</P>

<P>WHEN a &s;olitary traveller, en&s;hrouded by mid-night darkne&s;s, wanders exhau&s;ted through the intricate mazes of a fore&s;t, not know|ing the road which leads to his peaceful home; when every uncertain &s;tep entangles him more and more in briars and thorns; when all around him is buried in profound &s;ilence, and only the croaking owl flies before him from tree to tree, with me|lancholy &s;hrieks, and his mournful accents are

Here! &s;ays he, cheerfully to him&s;elf; here are men, thy bre|thren!&mdash;But, whi&s;pers his guardian angel, per|haps, they are robbers: and circum&s;pection adds, robbers, of the la&s;t remaining ray of hope.</P>
<P>This picture conveys but a faint idea of Caro|line's &s;en&s;ations, of the confu&s;ed emotions, which, in that moment, &s;eized her perturbed &s;en&s;es. She &s;truggled, in vain, to exert the la&s;t &s;trength of her exhau&s;ted mu&s;cles, to receive the me&s;&s;enger, by whom &s;he apprehended to hear her doom pro|nounced. Her whole form was a picture of fear blended with de&s;pair, which was tinged only with a faint ray of di&s;tant hope.</P>
<P>The &s;ervant, who was &s;itting by the fire-&s;ide, and had fallen a&s;leep at the &s;pinning-wheel, heard the ringing of the bell, &s;tarted up, and &s;taggered half-&s;leeping out of the room to open the door. She had &s;carcely &s;tept into the pa&s;&s;age, when a draught of air from the garden extingui&s;hed her lamp. However, as it already was broad day, &s;he he&s;itated not to unfa&s;ten the door. When &s;he opened it, &s;he was acco&s;ted by a man whom &s;he knew not, becau&s;e his hat covered the upper part of his face. He gave her a letter, &s;eemed to be inclined to &s;peak, but in&s;tantly checked him&s;elf, and di&s;appeared. Caroline's eyes devoured the letter; &s;he tore it impatiently out of Hannah's hands, while all her limbs trembled, every mu&s;cle quivered, her cheeks glowed, and her breath &s;topped. However, &s;he perceived &s;uddenly, that it was the hand-writing of her hu&s;band. This, and the griefle&s;s direction, <HI>To my dear wife!</HI> re|&s;tored her for a few moments to the u&s;e of her &s;peech. "God be prai&s;ed!" exclaimed &s;he: "he

She dropped on her knees; a &s;parkling tear, worthy to be ki&s;&s;ed away by angels, &s;wam in her eye, which was rai&s;ed to heaven; her hands folded them&s;elves, and&mdash;&s;he was &s;peechle&s;s. If my readers ever have been at Ca&s;&s;el, and &s;een Cleopatra, Ti&s;hbein's ma&s;ter-piece, they will be able to conceive an idea of Caroline, during the pau&s;e of &s;ilence. Her grateful looks were the mo&s;t eloquent and affecting prayers. She collected her&s;elf at la&s;t, opened the letter on her knees, and read as follows:</P>

I left you&mdash;although, not quite without rea&s;on, yet, too ha&s;tily and imprudently. Did I not know that my Caroline has an undaunted &s;pirit? that &s;he is far &s;uperior to the generality of her &s;ex, who know not what to do, when a dark cloud overca&s;t the horizon of their life for a &s;hort time? Did I not know, that religion and love can perform mira|cles? that Caroline's heart is the abode of both, and, that virtue, con&s;cious of its innate greatne&s;s, never wants re&s;olution? Is not God above us, who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance is neare&s;t when we are lea&s;t aware of it?&mdash;And, particularly now, when my dear Caroline is on the point of being a mother the &s;econd time, &s;he will, undoubtedly, call forth all her firmne&s;s, to bear a trifling misfortune, which, perhaps, will &s;eparate me a few weeks from her. Yes, deare&s;t love, I am nece&s;&s;iated to make a &s;hort journey, in which you, in your pre&s;ent &s;ituation, cannot join me. The governor&mdash;need I to &s;ay more?

You will, probably, have &s;u&s;tained many ter|rors, and gloomy apprehen&s;ions la&s;t night&mdash;ano|ther con&s;equence of my heedle&s;&s;ne&s;s.

Perhaps, they only wanted to frighten me, to make room for a ba&s;e villain. How could they be ignorant, that I am proud of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a wife, who wants no male protector, who by one commanding look, can check the mo&s;t unbridled pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>I begin, therefore, my journey with tranquilli|ty, and confidence in the protection of God. I am on the road to Berlin, to throw my&s;elf at the feet of our king, to implore his ju&s;tice, and you know our excellent monarch&mdash;his name ought to in&s;pire you with the brighte&s;t hopes. I expect to clo&s;e you again in my arms after &s;ix or eight weeks. Till then farewell, my deare&s;t love.

Con|&s;ider what you owe to your&s;elf! con&s;ider that ano|ther life depends upon yours, the life of an inno|cent being, which will atone for all your &s;orrows by its fir&s;t infantine &s;mile.</P>
<P>I am determined to &s;ee you no more before my departure; receive this letter as my farewell exhortation. I would however not have you think that I am apprehen&s;ive of any danger. Vil|lainy only &s;hrouds it&s;elf in midnight darkne&s;s and &s;huns the rays of the &s;un.

<P>Adieu, my dear Caroline! ki&s;s our William! thank hone&s;t Conrad for his di&s;intere&s;ted friend|&s;hip. Farewell! as &s;oon as I am arrived at Ber|lin, you &s;hall hear again from your loving hu&s;|band,</P>

How happy are we when the &s;miling &s;un of hope &s;hines on the bubble of our wi&s;hes and ex|pectations; when it charms the eye of our mind by a thou&s;and variegated colours! However, how much more mi&s;erable do we feel, when &s;uddenly a threatening cloud, tinged with the hue of darke&s;t midnight, de&s;troys the &s;weet amu&s;ement of our imagination. The &s;un is overclouded, and the bubble bur&s;ts.</P>
<P>The &s;udden tran&s;it from cordial and grateful joy to agonizing grief was too rapid for Caroline.</P>
<P>Although Ortenberg had worded his letter with the greate&s;t circum&s;pection, and treated the matter as lightly as po&s;&s;ible, yet its contents were &s;till too much for a woman who was &s;even months gone in her pregnancy, and already had endured one night replete with torments which were more excruciating than an infernal demon would have inflicted. She &s;unk exhau&s;ted into her arm-chair, her eyes were no longer capable of weeping, her brea&s;t attempted in vain to ea&s;e its load by &s;ighs, her head reclined again&s;t the back of her chair, her arms hung down; her whole po&s;ture was that of a per&s;on utterly incapable of motion.</P>
<P>"Is nobody there?" exclaimed a voice in the &s;treet, while a knobbed &s;tick, at the &s;ame time, knocked pretty rough again&s;t the door.</P>
<P>"Who knocks?" a&s;ked the &s;ervant in a low voice.</P>
<P>"Good friend!" roared the ba&s;s of the old Captain.</P>
<P>"Guard, open the gate! let down the draw|bridge, the detachment is returned.&mdash;Cheer up, Madam!" exclaimed the old &s;oldier as he &s;tept into the room, wiping the &s;weat from his brow, "cheer up! it was only a fal&s;e alarm. Mr. Or|tenberg will &s;oon be here again."</P>

When the condemned innocent is arrived at the place of execution, and the dreadful &s;word of blind ju&s;tice glitters already in the hand of the &s;tern executioner; when the guiltle&s;s victim has lo&s;t his recollection; does he then not &s;till think he beholds in every white handkerchief that is held up a &s;ignal for his reprieve?</P>
<P>Caroline had the mo&s;t unequivocal proof of her hu&s;band's misfortune, the fatal letter, in her hand, yet a ray of hope darted acro&s;s her &s;oul when the blunt &s;oldier called to her in a firm tone of voice: <HI>"Cheer up, Madam!"</HI></P>

<P>Yes, Madam! It is as I told you. I hope he will again return to head quarters in a few hours, and li&s;ten patiently to your curtain lecture. He has de&s;erved it, becau&s;e it is not right to march out of the camp without orders.</P>

<P><PB N="34" REF="037761_0033_100F04B7B29835A0">
The Captain was confounded, and &s;tammered a long, <HI>"So!</HI> I &s;ee, I mu&s;t confe&s;s that I have told a lie; I am a&s;hamed of it. But what could I do, deare&s;t Madam? Could I tell you that I had gone after him to no purpo&s;e? That would have been very fine, indeed! I &s;hould have de&s;erved to run the gauntlet. You would have battered my poor old heart with your lamentations, and my little rea&s;on would have been put totally in di&s;order. But this is the natural con&s;equence of all lies; cur&s;e all fal&s;hoods! I will never again deviate from truth. May the provo&s;t mar&s;hal order me to be put in irons and dieted with bread and wa|ter, if ever I give truth another &s;lap in the face. I never &s;hall be &s;uch a fool again."</P>
<P>This was the la&s;t fatal blow. Caroline fell back in her chair. The ro&s;y hue of her cheeks turned to a dead white, her eyes broke, and her lips were tinged blue.</P>
<P>"Holy Virgin, have mercy! wheel to the right! march!" called the Captain to the &s;ervant: "could not the &s;tupid bea&s;t have gone twenty times for the phy&s;ician? mu&s;t you fir&s;t wait for the word of command in &s;uch a ca&s;e?"</P>
<P>The &s;ervant hurried away. The Captain rum|maged his whole medicine-che&s;t, took out hart&s;|horn, Hungary water, &s;pirit of vinegar, and a&s;&s;a|foetida, and held one after the other to Caroline's no&s;e. But all his pains were fruitle&s;s. He rub|bed her temples: but all without effect. He took her in his arms, and &s;hook her violently; alas! &s;he awoke not. "God have mercy on us!" ex|claimed he; "what an unfortunate mi&s;erable fel|low am I! by what have I de&s;erved to be puni&s;h|ed thus in my old days! that angel of a woman will die in my arms! I cannot bear to &s;ee it!</P>
<P>He replaced Caroline in her arm chair, and limped into the garden, where he put his &s;ingers
<PB N="35" REF="037761_0034_100F04B93B486FF8">
in his ears, running up and down, &s;inging and whi&s;tling, as if he wanted to &s;tun his &s;en&s;es and memory.</P>
<P>Lettle William awoke at la&s;t from his quiet &s;lumber, and &s;eeing the helple&s;s &s;ituation of his mother, thought &s;he was &s;leeping. He was, in|deed, a&s;toni&s;hed to perceive by his dre&s;s, that he had not been put to bed the preceding night; be|ing, however, not u&s;ed to reflect upon what his parents thought proper to do; he was rather re|joiced, becau&s;e he expected he &s;hould not be combed, curled, and wa&s;hed that morning. He got cautiou&s;ly from his chair, le&s;t he &s;hould a|wake his mother, rubbed his eyes, and looked at the wooden clock. It was pa&s;t &s;even. Papa, thought William, mu&s;t already be at &s;chool, and it is high time that I al&s;o &s;hould go. I cannot conceive why they &s;uffered me to &s;leep &s;o long. I now mu&s;t go to &s;chool, without having had my tea and roll. However, I rather will go without my breakfa&s;t, than di&s;turb mamma.</P>
<P>During this &s;oliloquy, he got his books toge|ther, with as little noi&s;e as po&s;&s;ible, and was ju&s;t going to &s;teal away upon his toes with an empty &s;tomach, when the phy&s;ician &s;tepped into the a|partment. The latter ordered Caroline to be immediately put to bed, and a midwife to be &s;ent for.</P>

Caroline lay extended upon her couch; her face was pale as a lily, her eyes languid as a drooping flower, her lips, formerly blooming like the full-blown ro&s;e, now were of an a&s;h-colour, and parch|ed up. However, a calm and &s;erene countenance, re&s;embling a fine autumnal evening at the &s;etting of the &s;un, proclaimed clearly, that &s;he anticipated her impending union with &s;ainted &s;pirits. She extended her hand, faintly &s;miling, and &s;aid, in a weak tone of voice: "dear Captain, I do not think I &s;hall recover. God's will be done!&mdash;I look upon you as my father&mdash;"</P>

<P>Yes, madam, I have &s;een many a brave fellow die. Death is on the&s;e occa&s;ions dreadful, but it affects not. The &s;ufferings of a gentle and beloved woman, breaks the heart, and forces tears from the eye: I feel it to-day for the fir&s;t time.</P>

<P>William now was called to her bed-&s;ide. Ca|roline laid her hand upon his head, and &s;aid: "God ble&s;s you, my &s;on!&mdash;grow an hone&s;t man, and all the fonde&s;t wi&s;hes of your mother will be realized."</P>
<P>Her firmne&s;s had not hitherto for&s;aken her; &s;he had not &s;hed a &s;ingle tear, but now took her &s;on in her arms, and wept aloud:</P>
<P>"God ble&s;s you, my &s;on! be happy! I part re|luctantly with you.&mdash;The heart under which you have lain, will &s;oon be cold&mdash;but never forget

<P>The &s;ervant was going to take him away; but Caroline extended her arms after him:</P>
<P>"No, do not leave me!&mdash;William! William! grow an hone&s;t man, like your father!&mdash;"</P>
<P>The phy&s;ician took the boy, &s;miling, by the hand, and conducted him coldly out of the cham|ber, becau&s;e he &s;aw that his pre&s;ence affected Ca|roline too much. Caroline now turned to the Captain: "dear Captain, I have one more &s;avour to a&s;k: burn this letter!"</P>
<P>She gave him Ortenberg's letter. The Cap|tain put it mechanically in his pocket. "Speak comfort to my poor hu&s;band when he returns.&mdash;Take care of my interment&mdash;You will find &s;ome money in that cupboard yonder&mdash;di&s;tribute part of it to the poor."</P>
<P>The phy&s;ician reque&s;ted her to keep her&s;elf quiet, and de&s;ired every one to quit the apart|ment.

<P>Dreadfully mute&mdash;dreadfully grinning and &s;tamping the ground in frantic agony, &s;at the old Captain upon his chair, gnawing the top of his cane. He &s;at five dreadful hours on the &s;ame &s;pot, without being able to &s;hed a tear or even to utter a groan. At la&s;t he &s;uddenly recollected the letter which Caroline had given him with the reque&s;t to commit it to the fire. He put his hand ha&s;tily in his pocket, opened it, and read. When he came to the pa&s;&s;age in which the Governor is mentioned, his mouth frothed, though it was a riddle to him; he grinded his teeth audibly, clenched his fi&s;t mechanically, beating his fore|head, and the fir&s;t word he was capable to utter was: "villain, you &s;hall not e&s;cape me! venge|ance or death?

He then relap&s;ed again into his former reverie; death-like &s;tillne&s;s prevailed around him; no &s;ound was heard in the whole apartment but the grinding of his teeth.</P>
<P>The door was &s;uddenly flung open, and the governor entered, decorated with the order <HI>Pour le merite,</HI> which his &s;oldiers had acquired and he received, as it frequently happens.</P>
<P>He was about 40 years old, &s;lim and well made, had a pair of large &s;heep's eyes, an aquiline no&s;e, a &s;coff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing mouth, and a pair of firm and round calves, which he frequently &s;urveyed with &s;ecret &s;atisfaction, and which had made him a declared enemy to boots. His empty &s;kull, overgrown with an abundance of black hair, was covered with a hat adorned with a proud plume and gold. His &s;tiff tail whipped his thighs; his collar was buckled tight, which gave to his cheeks a martial dark-red hue; the uniform &s;eemed to be glued to his body; a cane, four <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eet high, with a gold top which contained the miniature picture of &s;ome venal beauty, was &s;u&s;pended between his fin|gers, which were adorned with &s;everal &s;parkling rings, di&s;playing likewi&s;e the pictures of different ladies, and &s;erving to &s;et off the uncommon white|ne&s;s of his hands; he di&s;played every moment with a triumphant mein, a gold &s;nuff-bix, which al&s;o exhibited the portrait of a conquered female, and even the ca&s;e of his watch concealed at lea&s;t half a dozen of female profiles, who&s;e originals he thought not to be worth painting, becau&s;e he had conquered them too ea&s;ily.</P>

The go|vernor, who never had boen a heroe, and met here with an old, rough veteran, in&s;tead of a gen|tle and obliging woman, was &s;o much confound|ed as to be entirely for&s;aken by his French im|pertinence, and to &s;tand motionle&s;s, as if rooted to the ground.

The Captain, who was &s;en&s;ible of the &s;uperi|ority which an hone&s;t man has over a rogue, con|tinued in his rough accent: "man! if you be an human being, and not detached from Hell by the Devil; look there! and crave pardon of God, the avenger of innocence."</P>
<P>With the&s;e words he flung the chamber-door open. Caroline's corp&s;e lay extended upon a board, her right hand upon her brea&s;t, and her dead child in the left arm. The governor was thunder-&s;truck, trembling violently, and averting his face, which was as white as a &s;heet.</P>

<P>He &s;eized the &s;tunned and &s;peechle&s;s Governor by the arm, dragging him into the garden behind a hedge, where none of the neighbours could &s;ee them. There he took Ortenberg's letter from his pocket, contemplated it mournfully, and &s;aid with bitterne&s;s: "go, poor fellow, go! the king cannot re&s;tore to you what you have lo&s;t.

opportunity of collecting his little courage; for he could &s;ee that he &s;hould find hot work. The Captain took, in the mean time, a pair of thick leather gloves out of his pocket, and &s;tuck his cane into the ground. The governor ca&s;t a &s;ide glance at him, and perceived the preparations which the old &s;oldier was making. Having how|ever frequented the fencing academy more than &s;even years, and broken many a rapier; he thought the old crippled Captain was not worth the palpi|tation which he felt at the very place where the order <HI>Pour le merite</HI> was &s;u&s;pended. "Well, and what more?" &s;aid he ridiculing, while he return|ed the letter. "What more?" roared the Cap|tain: "hell and furies! are not you &s;en&s;ible that you are a villain?"</P>

</SP>
<P>The Captain, being &s;eized with an un&s;peakable fury, which no pen can expre&s;s, tore foaming his order from his brea&s;t, trampled it with his feet to atoms, drew his &s;word and &s;tammered the words: "Oh! that my voice could r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ar like twenty bat|teries, to proclaim to you and the whole world with the voice of thunder, that you are the mo&s;t infernal villain!&mdash;Draw, and defend your&s;elf!"</P>

<P>It was unfortunately given you by our king; but he knew not to whom he gave it. You are a proof that kings al&s;o are weak mortals. De|fend your&s;elf!</P>

injured innocence, but with an impotent arm, and blinded by rage. The governor, on the other hand, was in the full vigour of life, and armed with &s;trength, caution, and &s;kill. The Captain was di&s;armed. The governor flung his antago|ni&s;t's &s;word over the garden wall. "Now, Sir!" &s;aid he in an arrogant tone, "your life is in my power; however, I will not interfere with the executioner. You have forfeited your head by having violated &s;ubordination, the mandate again&s;t duelling, and trampling upon the king's order. You have offended the king, not me. I &s;hall leave it to him to avenge me."</P>
<P>He put his &s;word triumphantly into the &s;cab|bard, collected the fragments of the broken or|der, and went away, rejoicing inwardly at his having been again a villain with impunity.</P>
<P>Shame, fury, and &s;ecret murmuring again&s;t Pro|vidence for having denied &s;trength to the arm that defended the cau&s;e of injured innocence, render|ed the good old man for &s;ome time &s;peechle&s;s, "Oh God!" exclaimed he at la&s;t, rai&s;ing his trem|bling hands to heav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">: "God, thou art incom|prehen&s;ible.

<P>A tear &s;ealed this prayer, which a&s;cended with fervent ardour to the throne of the Omnipotent.

<P>TO die is, in common life, like dying on the &s;tage. The &s;pectators weep, while the actor calmly quits the &s;cene when the curtain drops, and is &s;atisfied to have acted his part with applau&s;e.

The &s;en&s;ations of the dying, at mo&s;t, can be compared with that of an actor who performs a favourite character the la&s;t time, and with tears takes leave of a Public that e&s;teems him. However, this &s;imile is rarely applicable to tho&s;e who are left be|hind. Parents, children, and friends who are

groaning at the death-bed of their darling, ta&s;te the bitterne&s;s of twofold death; for a gloomy and cheerle&s;s futurity pre&s;ents it&s;elf to their view, while the happy conqueror anticipates the bli&s;s of a better world. The &s;on lo&s;es his father, but the father meets his parents again. No! death is dreadful only to the unfortunate wretch who lo&s;es his father, con&s;ort, &s;i&s;ter, brother, or friend. He &s;tares wildly at the lifele&s;s corp&s;e, not knowing how to reconcile him&s;elf to his lo&s;s, and &s;till hopes that the mournful &s;cene which he beholds, is only a frightful dream, from which he expects &s;oon to awake; and that &s;ingular delu&s;ion la&s;ts to the moment of interment. When the dear corp&s;e has left the hou&s;e, and the funeral train has di&s;ap|peared from his gazing eyes, he fir&s;t feels the whole extent of his lo&s;s. The day of interment is, un|doubtedly, more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to the unhappy mourner than the day of death. While he &s;ees the body of his departed friend extended before his eyes, can moi&s;ten his &s;tiff hand with his tears, and im|print ki&s;&s;es on his cold lips, his fate appears le&s;s dreadful to him. But now the coffin is &s;crewed up, the undertakers carry his darling down &s;tairs, and, alas! he &s;hall never &s;ee him again. Oh! parting from beloved friends, thou are dreadful! Every &s;uffering admits of comfort, every pain is relieved by tears: but parting is relieved neither by tears nor con&s;olation.</P>
<P>The day of interment appeared. Caroline was dre&s;&s;ed in white &s;atin, and her brown hair adorn|ed with cypre&s;s: the infant lay in her arms. The apartment was lined with black crape, and eight torches burned on both &s;ides of the coffin. The afflicted old man &s;at at the head wiping with the knuckles of his hands the tears from his eyes, groaning and exclaiming with a faint voice: "I loved her like a daughter! &s;he now is the daugh|ter
<PB N="48" REF="037761_0047_100F04D5F77FF260">
of God! but, alas! her death is more than I can bear!"</P>
<P>William was dre&s;&s;ed in black, his auburn un|powdered hair was tied with black crape, and thus he &s;tood between the legs of the old Captain, a&s;king him repeatedly whether his dear mamma would awake no more? Old Conrad &s;at in mute &s;orrow at the feet of the corp&s;e, his hands folded, his head bent again&s;t the left &s;houlder, and &s;taring at the ground. This old Conrad, who, probably, has long intere&s;ted the reader's curio&s;ity, was &s;teward in the Governor's hou&s;e, and the only hone&s;t being who entered the door of his ma&s;ter. The Governor would, probably, have turned him into the &s;treet long &s;ince, if he had not regarded him as a part of his paternal inheritance, and been obliged to confe&s;s reluctantly that Conrad's fidelity and incorruptible hone&s;ty had &s;aved his finances &s;everal times from ruin. The villain ridiculed the hone&s;t fellow, but did not wi&s;h to part with him. Conrad, who&s;e &s;oul was wounded by the exce&s;&s;es of his ma&s;ter, had been repeatedly on the point of quitting his &s;ervice. Nothing could have retained him but the idea that the Governor's father had been his benefactor. He &s;taid therefore, &s;ub|mitted to what he could not alter, and dragged the cart frequently out of the mud, when his ma&s;ter had involved him&s;elf in &s;erious difficulties. He was a native of Bre&s;law, and thence originated his acquaintance with Ortenberg and his wife. He had been a &s;chool-fellow of Ortenberg's father, and always retained a cordial regard for his family. He had accidentally di&s;covered the Governor's ba&s;e de&s;ign upon Caroline&punc; and the misfortune which threatened his old friend Ortenberg. He informed him immediately of it by the above men|tioned note, and returned without delay to his
<PB N="49" REF="037761_0048_100F04D77B86AD90">
ma&s;ter's hou&s;e, le&s;t his ab&s;ence &s;hould expo&s;e him to &s;u&s;picion. Ortenberg fled. His flight produ|ced, as we know, the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences, and Conrad was not the la&s;t who was informed of it.</P>
<P>"Barbara!" &s;aid he to his wife. "pack up our little property; I &s;hall quit this cur&s;ed hou&s;e to|day." Barbara was one of tho&s;e wives who by the vulgar are called a ble&s;&s;ing of the Devil: A little thin, and &s;piteful creature, decorated with a Mulatto no&s;e, a pair of green eyes, and a &s;mall remnant of half and quarter teeth. The gout and a&s;thma tormented her now and then in a mo&s;t lamentable manner; but her tongue enjoyed the mo&s;t excellent health, for &s;he took all po&s;&s;ible pains to prove that a <HI>perpetuum mobile</HI> was po&s;|&s;ible, notwith&s;tanding a practice of near &s;ixty years, in which &s;he had not taken the lea&s;t pains to &s;pare that wonderful member. Her words ru&s;hed over the wrecks of her teeth, like a rapid torrent which rolls over the ruins of decayed buildings, and the &s;tream of her eloquence continued to flow even when &s;leep had touched her running eyes with his &s;oporific wand; or to &s;peak in plain language, &s;he talked in her &s;leep. By this means, Conrad had di&s;covered the Governor's de&s;ign upon Caroline, which Mon&s;ieur Coquin, the French valet, had communicated to his gentle helpmate, under the injunction of the mo&s;t profound &s;ecrecy. She di&s;|liked nothing more than going to church, becau&s;e &s;he dur&s;t not contradict the preacher; however, &s;he pre&s;ided in all the meetings of the go&s;&s;ips of the town. She was perfectly convinced that the words of the Go&s;pel, <HI>The man shall be the head of the wife,</HI> are not properly tran&s;lated; and in order to render her&s;elf capable of refuting that pa&s;&s;age, took, in her younger years, le&s;&s;ons in the Hebrew
<PB N="50" REF="037761_0049_100F053D0D8BC600">
language of a &s;tout Prebendary, who knew noth|ing of it him&s;elf. But when the wicked world be|gan to &s;u&s;pect her virtue, &s;he abandoned this re&s;o|lution again, and married hone&s;t Conrad. She now took all po&s;&s;ible pains to refute, at lea&s;t by her example, the truth of that pa&s;&s;age. Conrad loved peace and tranquillity. He &s;ubmitted quietly to all the whims of his wife, while it militated not again&s;t his con&s;cience. But as &s;oon as his con&s;cience told him that it would be wrong to indulge her any longer, he commanded her peremptorily to be &s;ilent, and when that was of no u&s;e, applied the eloquence of a good hor&s;ewhip &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully, as to put a temporary &s;top to the agility of her tongue, and to draw torrents of tears from her green eyes. However, Barbara rarely carried matters to that extremity, and when Conrad ordered her in his authoritative accent, the meaning of which &s;he knew perfectly well, to check the fluency of her eloquence, &s;he obeyed his command without grumbling.</P>
<P>Conrad having thus &s;upported his authority, he exchanged his &s;plendid livery for a threadbare great coat, took his &s;taff in his hand, and &s;tept in|to the apartment of his Excellency, who, exhau&s;t|ed by ye&s;terday's duel, recruited his animal &s;pirits with a di&s;h of chocolate &s;teeped in Burgundy, and amu&s;ed him&s;elf with reading the <HI>Pucelle d'Orleans.</HI></P>

limping and howling into the hou&s;e. She did not think it proper to wait for a <HI>da capo</HI> of her hu&s;band's care&s;&s;es, and ran roaring back. Conrad proceeded to Ortenberg's hou&s;e, and there &s;eated him&s;elf at the feet of the dead Caroline in the above-men|tioned po&s;ture.</P>
<P>Lamenting cripples and weeping paupers be|&s;ieged the door. Every one held the la&s;t alms in his hand which he owed to Caroline's charitable donation; for the Captain, to whom her la&s;t words were as &s;acred as holy writ, had not only made large di&s;tributions of the money which he found in the place, pointed out to him by his friend previous to her di&s;&s;olution, but al&s;o added a few dollars from his own &s;canty &s;tock; which he had hoarded up to purcha&s;e The Hi&s;tory of the Thirty Years War. Groans and lamentations re&s;ounded at the &s;treet|door from the lips of all the&s;e poor wretches. They related to each other in doleful accents, how often Caroline's charity had pre&s;erved them from &s;tarv|ing; how good and &s;trong the &s;oup was, which &s;he had &s;ent to &s;ome of them in their late illne&s;s.</P>
<P>It &s;truck ten o'clock. The funeral train pro|ceeded towards the church yard. The venerable Captain &s;taggered at the head of the poor, behind the coffin, &s;upported by Conrad and another of Ortenberg's friends. He had wrapt a crape round his left arm, looking down upon this badge of mourning, and muttering con&s;tantly, as he went along: "Alas! I loved her &s;o much, &s;he ought not to have treated me thus."</P>
<P>The clergyman read at the church yard accord|ing to cu&s;tom, a chapter from the Bible, and con|cluded with the following words: it would be needle&s;s, were I to de&s;cant to you upon the virtues of our &s;ainted &s;i&s;ter. Every one of you knew her; &s;he was a worthy excellent woman."&mdash;(Indeed &s;he
<PB N="54" REF="037761_0053_100F04DF5CBFD148">

She now has received the palm of peace in yon better regions, and her reward is un&s;peakable. The Lord ble&s;s thee, and keep thee; the Lord make his face &s;hine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee; the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace. Amen!"</P>
<P>When the coffin was let down into the grave, and Caroline's terre&s;trial part was to be covered with earth, the hone&s;t &s;oldier was no longer able to check the emotions of the mo&s;t violent agony. He began to moan &s;o loudly and woefully, that the hearts of all the bye-&s;tanders were ready to break. The clergy|man attempted to comfort him, but he replied angrily;</P>
<P>"Alas! reverend Sir, you neither knew her, nor do you know me. I am now good for nothing in this world, for nothing at all.

Oh! that &s;ome per&s;on would commi&s;erate my di&s;tre&s;s, and knock me on the head! He returned to the hou&s;e a prey to heart-breaking grief. The fir&s;t object which he beheld on entering his apartment, was a cap lined with fur, which Caroline had given him on his la&s;t birth-day. He &s;eized it with infantine eagerne&s;s, put it on his head, and went to the looking gla&s;s, while tears trickled down the venerable furrows of his cheeks. He walked groaning up and down the room more than two hours, before he went to bed. The &s;ervant found him next morning dead on his couch. An apoplectic fit had terminated his exi&s;|tence. The cap which he had received from Caro|line, lay in his folded hands. A tear, which was not yet dried up entirely, &s;tood on his cheek.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WE acquainted the reader in the antecedent chapters, with the leading &s;cenes of this hi&s;tory&punc; for fear of tiring his patience by a long-winded introduction; but it now will be high time we &s;hould draw the curtain, and elucidate the events related in the preceding chapters. Charles Fre|deric Ortenberg, the unhappy hu&s;band of Caro|line,
<PB N="57" REF="037761_0056_100F04E6A9E31948">
was a native of Bre&s;law. His father, an opulent merchant, of that city, had only one &s;on be&s;ides him, who&s;e name was Nicolaus Ortenberg. The latter was already in his boyi&s;h years ex|tremely fond of the lives of adventurers, e&s;peci|ally of &s;ea-faring men. When he, at &s;chool, re|clined his two elbows again&s;t the table, devouring, as it were, the book which lay before him with his eyes, and moi&s;tening the ends of his &s;ingers with his tongue, in order to turn the leaves more quickly: his &s;choolma&s;ter could be certain that he &s;hould catch him in the act of reading Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe, Robert Pierot, or &s;ome other book of that &s;ort, in&s;tead of Julius Cae&s;ar or Cicero; the general con&s;equence was, the immediate confi&s;|cation of his favourite author.</P>
<P>However this could not deter him from apply|ing every farthing he could &s;ave to the pro&s;ecu|tion of his favourite literature and the book&s;eller always got more money from him than the fruit|erer and pa&s;try-cook. His father inferred from this that Nicolaus mu&s;t have a pa&s;&s;ionate de&s;ire to &s;ee the world. He was glad that his elde&s;t &s;on di&s;played a liking for the mercantile line, becau&s;e his wife had made him promi&s;e, previous to the birth of the younge&s;t, that, in ca&s;e &s;he &s;hould be delivered of a boy, he &s;hould be brought up for the church. He re&s;olved therefore to &s;end little Nicolaus, as &s;oon as he &s;hould have attained his fifteenth year, to Am&s;terdam, to article him as apprentice to a great hou&s;e, and afterwards to let him make a voyage to the Dutch &s;ettlements in the Ea&s;t-Indies, to gratify his de&s;ire of know|ledge. He therefore cau&s;ed him to be carefully in&s;tructed in accounts, writing, mathematics, Dutch, French and Engli&s;h, and when he had entered his &s;ixteenth year, &s;ent him to Am&s;ter|dam
<PB N="58" REF="037761_0057_100F04E8A70424D8">
to the hou&s;e of an old friend, to commence his apprentice&s;hip. He had never been a favour|ite of his mother, and this was the rea&s;on why his heart, which naturally was excellent, was neglect|ed, and his manners were unpoli&s;hed. He took leave of his parents without &s;hedding a &s;ingle tear. His head was too much occupied with the de&s;art i&s;lands which he intended to di&s;cover, and the gold and precious &s;tones which he expected to find there. He even had made a plan how he would cure the &s;kins of the unknown animals which he &s;hould di&s;cover, and to make them fit|ter for being made up into garments than tho&s;e which Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe had employed for that purpo&s;e. He &s;tept, therefore, into the mail, en|tirely occupied with airy ca&s;tles, and no reflec|tion on his parents, no jo&s;tling of the vehicle, in|terrupted him in his &s;weet reveries. Five years of his apprentice&s;hip elap&s;ed without giving his manner of thinking another turn; he rather heat|ed his imagination more and more every day. In the long winter evenings, and on Sundays and holydays, when his comrades went to taverns and coffee-hou&s;es, or killed their time and &s;quander|ed their money away at the gaming table, he u&s;ed to &s;it down by the fire &s;ide, leaning his left arm upon a round table, which was loaded with a &s;moaking tea-urn, and always held in his right hand one of tho&s;e numberle&s;s imitations of Defoe's Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe, which, at his time, inundated Europe.</P>
<P>Although the mind of the young man received a very romantic turn by his readings, and his brains were left as de&s;titute of &s;olid knowledge as his imaginary de&s;ert i&s;lands were of cultivation; yet he derived from them the advantage of being ren|dered entirely indifferent to all the fa&s;hionable
<PB N="59" REF="037761_0058_100F04EAAEC340A0">
di&s;&s;ipations of his age, which enabled him to attend with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous diligence to the occupa|tions of his calling.</P>
<P>It was, however, at la&s;t, impo&s;&s;ible for him to check his ardent de&s;ire of going to &s;ea any longer. He teazed his ma&s;ter every day to &s;end him as fac|tor to the Ea&s;t-Indies. I would, however, not have my readers to imagine that he con&s;idered Batavia as the &s;pot where he expected to make his fortune; for the bu&s;tle of that great city, the re|gular con&s;titution of the &s;tate, and the exten&s;ive connexions which it maintained with all parts of the inhabited globe&mdash;all this did not agree with his plans. He de&s;ired that the &s;hore where he hoped to arrive on a plank or an empty ca&s;k, &s;hould be as wild and uncultivated as the world was on the fir&s;t day of creation, and he would have preferred a garri&s;on of wild goats to the fir&s;t re|giment in the &s;ervice of the States-General. But why then was he &s;o pre&s;&s;ing in his reque&s;t to be &s;ent to the Ea&s;t-Indies?&mdash;From no other rea&s;on but becau&s;e he was perfectly certain that he &s;hould be taken on his voyage by a pirate, and carried for a year or two to Algiers, Tunis, or Tripoli, where he expected to effect his e&s;cape without much difficulty.</P>
<P>However, our young adventurer found it more difficult than he had thought at fir&s;t, to per&s;uade his patron to comply with his wi&s;hes. Experience teaches us every day that merchants are particular|ly reluctant to part with &s;ervants who are e&s;&s;en|tially u&s;eful to them; and as Nicolaus Ortenberg, after the expiration of the time of his appren|tice&s;hip, was the mo&s;t u&s;eful clerk in the count|ing-hou&s;e, upon who&s;e fidelity and diligence the Dutchman could implicitly rely, he always con|trived to &s;tart &s;ome pretext to deny the young
<PB N="60" REF="037761_0059_100F04EC421D0400">
man's reque&s;t for the pre&s;ent, although it was his father's wi&s;h he &s;hould &s;ee the world.</P>
<P>Nicolaus was, at length, tired of being fed any longer with empty promi&s;es, and re&s;olved to take the helm of his life in his own hand. I &s;ay, he re&s;olved, which is as much as if I had &s;aid, he conceived the idea; for thinking and re&s;olving is always one act with people of his di&s;po&s;ition. It was therefore no wonder that he di&s;appeared a few days after his bad or good genius had put this idea into his head, leaving the greate&s;t part of his property behind. He had, indeed, re&s;olv|ed, at fir&s;t, to convey a che&s;t with all &s;orts of tools &s;ecretly on board the ve&s;&s;el, which he hoped would be wrecked on &s;ome de&s;art i&s;land in fa|vour of his romantic plans; but recollecting that the wreck of the &s;tranded &s;hip would &s;upply him &s;ufficiently with all implements of that &s;ort, he abandoned this idea again, and decamped in a beautiful vernal night, indifferently provided with wearing apparel, and &s;till poorer in ca&s;h.</P>
<P>Although the biographer of the Ortenberg fa|mily knows perfectly well what is become of our adventurer, and where he &s;pent the &s;ucceeding five and twenty years; yet he thinks it would be improper to communicate his knowledge of his fate to the reader in this place; but promi&s;es, at the &s;ame time, that he &s;hall make his appearance again at a period when his arrival will cau&s;e as much plea&s;ure as that of Admiral Rodney gave to the political world after the famous battle of the twelfth of April.</P>
<P>His clande&s;tine departure cau&s;ed the mo&s;t pun|gent affliction to his old father. The mother, however, who&s;e whole affection concentered in his younger brother Frederic, whom &s;he intend|ed to bring up for the church, &s;oon forgot the
<PB N="61" REF="037761_0060_100F04EEC341FC00">
rough &s;ailor, as &s;he u&s;ed to call Nicolaus. Her hu&s;band, on the contrary, who was on the verge of his eighty-fourth year, could not reconcile him|&s;elf to this &s;evere blow.</P>
<P>Nicolaus was, for his open and guiltle&s;s heart and blunt hone&s;ty, his very picture, and, on that account, his father's favourite. When all enqui|ries and adverti&s;ements were fruitle&s;s, the old man con&s;umed his la&s;t &s;trength by fretting after his darling, and died, at la&s;t, like an aged oak who&s;e la&s;t remaining &s;ap has been dried up by a &s;troke of lightning.</P>

<P>ALTHOUGH the whole town had thought old Ortenberg was immen&s;ely rich, yet after the payment of all his debts, &s;carcely as much was le&s;t as was &s;ufficient for his widow to live de|cently, and to &s;end her &s;econd &s;on to an univer|&s;ity. This &s;on, our Charles Frederic Ortenberg, now had attained his nineteenth year. All his in&s;tructors gave him the mo&s;t favourable te&s;timo|ny, and his mother in&s;i&s;ted he &s;hould quit Bre|&s;law, and go to Frankfort on the order, to render him&s;elf capable of &s;upporting her in her old age.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="037761_0061_100F04F124BB55E8">
She was enraptured a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the thought that &s;he &s;hould &s;ee her Frederic, in a few years, in the pulpit of his native town and hear him preach the Go&s;pel with all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ervour with which &s;he believed in it. Ortenberg him&s;elf wi&s;hed to be able to afford her that &s;atisfaction before her death, and re&s;olved to quit his native town in &s;pring.</P>
<P>However he con&s;ented reluctantly to his mo|ther's plan; becau&s;e his filial affection was coun|teracted by love for another object which fre|quently got the better of his tenderne&s;s for his parent. Reader, do not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> our hero on that account, for, alas! the power of nature is too im|perious to be ea&s;ily overcome by rea&s;oning and principles. We frequently love a faithle&s;s mi&s;|tre&s;s more firmly than a fond mother, who cheer|fully would lay down her life to in&s;ure our hap|pine&s;s.</P>
<P>Caroline Summer was the name of the &s;weet creature who had conquered Ortenberg's heart, and, as my readers know, was goodne&s;s it&s;elf; and, alas! is already buried. I &s;hall not attempt the arduous ta&s;k of portraying all the charms of her beautiful per&s;on, and her &s;till more beautiful mind. I only ob&s;erve that &s;he had a pair of eyes which no one could behold without feeling the flame of love creeping through every vein&mdash;eyes, &s;erene and blue like the &s;ky in a clear vernal morn; animated with youthful fire, and tempered only by the &s;hade of her long eye-la&s;hes, which, when &s;he ca&s;t them down, made her look like a Madonna. Mild, forbearing kindne&s;s, was the principal feature of her excellent character.</P>
<P>They had had frequent opportunities of &s;eeing each other in company; always hung their heads when they came to &s;ome place where they ex|pected to meet, and &s;aw their hopes di&s;appointed; were always animated with vi&s;ible hilarity when
<PB N="63" REF="037761_0062_100F04F2C76F3A90">
one of them unexpectedly entered the apartment. This la&s;ted &s;ome time, and neither Ortenberg nor Caroline conceived the &s;malle&s;t idea of reflecting upon that &s;ingular phaenomenon; for, novels, like tho&s;e which now-a-days a&s;&s;i&s;t the novices in love to interpret the &s;ecret meaning of their &s;entiments, were at tho&s;e times as &s;carce as a white raven.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t incident which opened Ortenberg's eyes, and actuated him to examine the &s;tate of his heart, happened on the following occa&s;ion: Caroline's father was an eminent merchant, and had been an intimate friend of old Ortenberg, who&s;e widow had depo&s;ited her little capital with him. This afforded young Ortenberg frequent opportunities to come to the hou&s;e of his mi&s;tre&s;s on his mother's affairs. One day he happened to enter the apartment ju&s;t when the family were drinking their coffee. Old Summer de&s;ired him to &s;it down, and &s;aid to his daughter, who &s;tood with down ca&s;t eyes, at the tea-table, and could have &s;erved a painter as a model of pure&s;t inno|cence: "Caroline, offer Mr. Ortenberg a di&s;h of coffee."</P>
<P>I know not whether it was owing to forgetful|ne&s;s, or becau&s;e Caroline was u&s;ed her&s;elf to drink her coffee without cream; in &s;hort, &s;he brought him a di&s;h of coffee without it, and made a neat courte&s;y.</P>
<P>Any one that had an opportunity of a&s;king Or|tenberg's mother in the realms of death, would have learnt that her &s;on had a&s;&s;ured her repeated|ly, that he could not bear coffee <HI>without</HI> cream. However, Caroline appeared to him a Hebe, the di&s;h &s;eemed to him to be filled with nectar, and from that moment he always drank his coffee without cream. The &s;un&s;hine of metaphy&s;ic, as much as he had learnt of it at &s;chool, was in&s;uf|ficient to enlighten all the folds of his heart, and
<PB N="64" REF="037761_0063_100F04F48734B230">
<HI>Amor</HI> had quartered his whole army (Captain Storm would have &s;aid) in the&s;e very folds. He had concealed the real &s;tate of his mind but too long from him&s;elf, and his heart always &s;hrunk back like a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> whenever his rea&s;on intruded it&s;elf as a confidant. I would, however, not have you to believe that he was happy during that &s;tate of incertitude; for, the old &s;aying, <HI>what I don't wot can't make me hot,</HI> is not applicabe to love. Love frequently heats us without our knowing any thing of its exi&s;tence; and &s;ometimes kindles a flame in us that, at la&s;t, will fla&s;h from our eyes in &s;pite of all our efforts to conceal it, and betray the &s;tate of our mind to every connoi&s;ure.</P>
<P>Ortenberg covered his &s;entiments a long time with the cloak of friend&s;hip, and was afraid to remove it in the &s;malle&s;t degree, le&s;t Love, with its whole retinue, &s;hould &s;uddenly pre&s;ent it&s;elf to his view. However, <HI>Amor</HI> grew at la&s;t tired of his long confinement, and broke unexpectedly his fetters on a fine autumnal day.</P>
<P>Old Summer had company in his garden; Ca|roline retired after coffee, when the company &s;at down to the card-table, to the remote&s;t rece&s;s of a little park which joined it, and &s;eating her&s;elf upon a terrace, took out her knitting, and began to work. I would lay an hundred ducats a|gain&s;t a pin, that &s;he &s;ecretly wi&s;hed Ortenberg would join her, but al&s;o that &s;he had no clear perception of this wi&s;h. Ortenberg &s;carcely mi&s;|&s;ed her, when he perceived that &s;ome my&s;terious charm urged him to quit the company, and his good genius conducted him directly to the &s;pot where Caroline was &s;itting.</P>
<P>He now &s;at by her &s;ide, beneath the &s;hade of an ancient beech-tree, which divided it&s;elf into two branches. A choir of chafinches caroled in the top, and mingled their amorous notes with
<PB N="65" REF="037761_0064_100F04F7686848B8">
the ru&s;tling of its leaves, moved by Zephyr's gentle breath.</P>
<P>Caroline plied her needle with the greate&s;t a&s;|&s;iduity, and pulled her &s;traw hat lower over her face, the real motives of which we cannot di|vine, as the thick texture of the branches of the beech-tree &s;heltered her completely again&s;t the rays of the &s;un.</P>
<P>"The weather is beautiful," &s;aid Ortenberg. "Yes," replied Caroline: "but it is rather too warm." This a&s;&s;ertion was an evident fal&s;ehood; for the autumnal air blew very fre&s;h; yet, for ought we know, &s;he might really have been too warm.</P>

<P>In this tone the conver&s;ation was carried on &s;ome time, although both were very &s;en&s;ible that they had to &s;peak of more important &s;ubjects. A myr|tle &s;prig which adorned Caroline's bo&s;om, ren|dered, at la&s;t, the conver&s;ation more intere&s;ting. Ortenberg begged Caroline to give it him. She took it from her bo&s;om; he extended his hand to receive it; their fingers came in contact; an electric fire &s;treamed through all their veins, and Caroline exclaimed with emotion; "my memory will die as fa&s;t in your bo&s;om as this myrtle will fade." She gave him the myrtle, looked upon her knitting, and a tear pearled in her eye. She averted her face, and attempted to wipe it off unperceived. Both were &s;ilent &s;ome time, Or|tenberg remained &s;everal minutes in the fame po&s;ture in which he had received the myrtle,
<PB N="66" REF="037761_0065_100F04F95CAC1A68">
He took at la&s;t his almanack out of his pocket, and wrote the following impromptu on a blank leaf:
<Q><L>Wither mu&s;t the faire&s;t flower,</L>
<L>Though thy hand have gathered it;</L>
<L>Naught on earth can brave the power</L>
<L>Of decay; beuty, wit,</L>
<L>Wealth, and &s;plendor, all mu&s;t peri&s;h,</L>
<L>Naught but love will never fade,</L>

<L>Threat'ning in the frowning &s;ky;</L>
<L>Naught impairs their la&s;ting power;</L>
<L>Love and friend&s;hip never die.</L></Q></P>
<P>He offered it trembling to Caroline. She read it, while his anxious eyes watched the emotions of hers. Her hand relap&s;ed upon her lap after &s;he had read the lines, and &s;he ca&s;t a glance at her lover, like that which the animated &s;tatue ca&s;t at Pygmalion. But it was not this glance alone that informed him of his happine&s;s. Her eye was again directed at the paper, and &s;he imprint|ed, at la&s;t, a fervent ki&s;s upon it. This was the &s;ignal for Ortenberg. He cla&s;ped her in his arms, and inhaled un&s;peakable rapture from her lips.</P>
<P>However, he robbed her al&s;o, unfortunately, of a patch which was on her lip, and now &s;tuck to his. Neither of them perceived it, for rea|&s;ons which are very obvious. His &s;oul was in the &s;ame &s;tate in which it had been at the time when he, for the fir&s;t time, drank coffee without cream; he would, therefore, not have
<PB N="67" REF="037761_0066_100F04FADFAC17E0">
been able to perceive it, if he had been covered all over with patches. If we, be&s;ides, con&s;ider, that he prudently took care not to wipe his mouth after having ki&s;&s;ed Caroline, we may ea&s;ily con|ceive that the patch quietly could occupy its po&s;t, without being di&s;turbed by him. If, however, one or the other of my readers &s;hould think it im|probable that Caroline al&s;o took no notice of that unmanly ornament, I can &s;afely refer him to eve|ry fair-one, and to a&s;k her upon her con&s;cience, whether &s;he was able to lift up her eyes in the next quarter of an hour after having cla&s;ped the dear object of her love the fir&s;t time to her bo|&s;om. Caroline at la&s;t ca&s;t her eyes colouring to the ground, and could not have looked up for worlds. She was &s;atisfied with making the re|mark, after half an hour, in which little was &s;aid, and much felt, that the company would mi&s;s them, and tripped &s;ilently on Ortenberg's arm towards the garden-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The company had, unfortunately, been merry at Caroline's expence, on account of the above|mentioned patch, before Ortenberg had arrived with his mother. Some young gentlemen had wittily ob&s;erved that it covered half a dozen of graces, while others had remarked that it was ra|ther too large. One of the company, who ima|gined him&s;elf a great wit, had, probably hatch|ed out &s;ome mirth creating idea, while Ortenberg and Caroline was acting the tender duodrama at the terrace. Apprehending he &s;hould be choaked by it, he directed therefore, as &s;oon as the young people entered the apartment, his eyes at the place where the patch had been fixed when Caro|line had left the company. It had di&s;appeared. However, his lynx-eye, unfortunately, di&s;covered that the patch was lodged on the &s;ame &s;pot of the left &s;ide of Ortenberg's lip, where it had been fix|ed
<PB N="68" REF="037761_0067_100F04FDE5CF4A70">
before on the right of Caroline's. In order to revenge him&s;elf for being deprived of an oppor|tunity to &s;port his wit, he made the company ob|&s;erve the fatal tran&s;location. Some &s;miled, and others pretended not to have heard his ob&s;erva|tion. Old Summer coloured deeply with anger. He ca&s;t an indignant look at Ortenberg, and be|trayed his pa&s;&s;ion by his ge&s;tures to the whole company. A general &s;ilence took place; Caroline could not conceal her confu&s;ion. Ortenberg had &s;o much pre&s;ence of mind to tell the company with a calm &s;mile, that Mi&s;s Summer had lo&s;t the patch in the garden, where he had &s;ound it, after a long &s;earch, in the gra&s;s, and as &s;he had refu&s;ed to redeem it by a ki&s;s, he had made u&s;e of it, to puni&s;h her for her ob&s;tinacy. The company pre|tended to take his a&s;&s;ertion for &s;terling coin, ad|mired the fine turn by which he extricated him|&s;elf, and every one believed as much of it as he thought proper. Old Summer watched from that moment every glance and motion of his daughter, and contrived to turn the pupils of his eyes &s;o artfully that it would have been u&s;ele&s;s if Argus had lent him half a dozen from his &s;uperfluous hundred. He failed, therefore, not to ob&s;erve the &s;ecret pre&s;&s;ure with which Caroline rewarded Ortenberg for his invention, when he, after &s;up|per, according to the cu&s;tom of his old fa&s;hi|oned times, ki&s;&s;ed her hand.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the gue&s;ts had taken their leave, a di&s;cour&s;e commenced between the father and his daughter, the thread of which Caroline in vain made repeated efforts to break.</P>
<P>The father, &s;itting in an ea&s;y chair, dre&s;&s;ed in a red dama&s;k night-gown, a cap of purple velvet on his head, and in yellow &s;lippers; a long tobacco|pipe in his mouth, and a bottle of ale before him upon a &s;traw mat.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="037761_0068_100F05004BDE21B8">
The daughter, in another corner of the apart|ment, &s;edulou&s;ly engaged in various little dome&s;tic occupations, and endeavouring to conceal the con|fu&s;ion occa&s;ioned by the expre&s;&s;ive glances of her father.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Father.</SPEAKER>
<P>My daughter has not behaved well to|day.</P>
</SP>
<P>Caroline made no reply. She ought however, to have con&s;idered that we mu&s;t not run acro&s;s the fields when large drops of rain begin to fall, but to endeavour to find &s;helter in the neare&s;t cot|tage. However, by being &s;ilent, &s;he ran right acro&s;s the field; for I challenge all the &s;eventy interpreters to declare whether her &s;ilence was not in fact as much as if &s;he had pleaded guilty! It was natural that old Summer, who &s;tood upon the vantage, did not give up his point, and con|tinued, "&s;he has forgot the advice which her &s;ainted mother repeated &s;o often to her."</P>
<P>The old man opened, with this reproach, a bat|tery which he, as Caroline well knew, u&s;ed to bring to bear only on very extraordinary occa|&s;ions. She fore&s;aw that &s;he &s;hould not be able to avoid facing the enemy, and therefore replied with as much re&s;olution as &s;he was mi&s;tre&s;s of, "how &s;o, dear papa?"</P>
<P>Re&s;olution and con&s;ideration are not always joined. This was, at lea&s;t, Caroline's ca&s;e, other|wi&s;e &s;he would not have made that reply; becau&s;e old Summer always was highly provoked when one of his family pretended to be ignorant of a fault with which the con&s;cience nece&s;&s;arily mu&s;t reproach the offender every moment. He knit, therefore, his brow, took the pipe out of his mouth, and replied with a tone of voice which was at lea&s;t three notes lower than u&s;ual.</P>
<P>"Have you already forgot the patch?"</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="037761_0069_100F0501CEA53CB0">
This was one of tho&s;e critical moments in which guiltle&s;s &s;ouls rarely act con&s;i&s;tently. Caroline had no other alternative, than either to deny the charge firmly, or to plead guilty. She had eve|ry rea&s;on to apprehend that all would be lo&s;t, and that &s;he would no more hear the carols of the chafinches in the beech-tree, if &s;he confe&s;&s;ed the fact. But in the former ca&s;e it was nece&s;&s;ary &s;he &s;hould lay the napkin which &s;he was folding im|mediately down, to&s;s up her no&s;e, and turning towards her father, exclaimed with &s;urpri&s;e, "the patch!"</P>
<P>She actually did all this ju&s;t as we have de&s;cri|bed it; but committed her&s;elf by doing it too late, and adding "dear papa!"</P>
<P>This addition made her father &s;u&s;pect that &s;he could not deny the charge, but wanted to palliate her guilt, by the endearing tone of her voice, and the repeated a&s;&s;urance of her filial love, particu|larly as he had &s;poken in the <HI>d sharp,</HI> whereas &s;he had replied in the <HI>e flat.</HI> He replied therefore in the &s;ame accent:</P>
<P>"If I really am your dear father, you will avoid in future all companies where you might meet with young Ortenberg."</P>
<P>This injunction was like a clap of thunder to Caroline. A gentle &s;hower was ju&s;t on the point of gu&s;hing from her eyes: &s;he caught the fir&s;t drops with her mouth, ta&s;ting thus for the fir&s;t time the bitterne&s;s of love, and collected her&s;elf as well as &s;he could.</P>
<P>"Your commands &s;hall be obeyed," &s;aid &s;he, in a crying accent, put her night-cap on, ki&s;&s;ed her father's hand, and went to bed.</P>
<P>However, &s;he clo&s;ed her long eye-la&s;hes to no purpo&s;e, and could not get a wink of &s;leep all the night.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="037761_0070_100F0503E1081DA0">
Ortenberg was in no better &s;ituation. His mo|ther que&s;tioned him about the patch, before he went to bed, and he confe&s;&s;ed, and denied not, prote&s;ting that Caroline was the only woman in the world who ever had intere&s;ted him, and beg|ged his mother not to refu&s;e him her maternal benediction, if ever he &s;hould be &s;o happy as to obtain her hand. But we know of how little con|&s;equence &s;uch benedictions are, no matter whe|ther they be pronounced by a prie&s;t or an old wo|man. The ble&s;&s;ing of the old lady availed no|thing, although &s;he be&s;towed it mo&s;t liberally; for Caroline was obedient to her father's com|mand, becau&s;e &s;he could not help it, and her glances could but rarely tell her lover at church that this re&s;traint had blown up the &s;park of pa&s;|&s;ion into a blazing flame, in&s;tead of extingui&s;hing it.</P>
<P>Ortenberg hit at la&s;t upon an expedient which any other young man, le&s;s blinded by love than he was, would have found out much &s;ooner. Ca|roline had a married &s;i&s;ter, a good-natured little woman, at who&s;e hou&s;e &s;he &s;pent every week an afternoon, and &s;taid till night. It was not advi|&s;able to appoint a meeting with Ortenberg in her hou&s;e, becau&s;e it was to be apprehended her bro|ther-in-law would &s;urpri&s;e them.</P>
<P>The young lover po&s;ted him&s;elf every even|ing when he knew that Caroline was with her &s;i&s;ter, again&s;t ten o'clock, in a little lane where &s;he mu&s;t pa&s;s on going home. The &s;ervant who &s;aw her home was entirely devoted to her, and thus the lovers could &s;ee and embrace each other at lea&s;t a few moments. Caroline was always rather timid on the&s;e clande&s;tine meetings. Her heart and knee always trembled like that of Chloe in the 23d Ode of Horace, when the breath of Zephyr ru&s;tled in the leaves of the vine which
<PB N="72" REF="037761_0071_100F0505EF0FD230">
run up again&s;t the hou&s;e, near which they gene|rally met. She never ventured to &s;top longer in the lane than five minutes, and always fled like a criminal, trembling at her own &s;hadow when &s;he looked round. Five minutes! how much, and how little time for a loving heart! Thus winter elap&s;ed, and the time drew near when Ortenberg was to quit Bre&s;law. Caroline was informed of it. She was with her &s;i&s;ter the evening previous to his departure. Her agony increa&s;ed vi&s;ibly, when &s;he perceived that it was near ten o'clock; her knitting kneedles trembled, her bo&s;om heav|ed quicker, and her &s;i&s;ter ca&s;t a compa&s;&s;ionate look at her. She &s;tarted ha&s;tily up from her chair when the &s;ervant entered to tell her, her maid was below to fetch her home. It rained violent|ly; however, Ortenberg had neverthele&s;s been waiting for her a good while, wrapt in a great coat. She flew anxiou&s;ly in his arms, and her fir&s;t que&s;tion was: "When &s;hall you &s;et out?"</P>
<P>"To-morrow."</P>

<P>"Yes, God &s;ees us!" repeated Caroline, &s;ob|bing, tearing her&s;elf from his embraces, and fled.</P>
<P>But no! She was not capable of parting &s;o &s;oon with the darling of her heart. She returned a|gain, and again, to embrace him once more. Her timidity had di&s;appeared entirely. She would not have minded if all the tiles had had eyes&mdash;for, the eyes of a world are in the hour of part|ing a contemptible nothing, which is &s;wept away by the la&s;t farewell tears. Ortenberg was, at la&s;t, obliged to conjure her to go home, to di&s;engage her hands from his neck, and to entreat her not
<PB N="73" REF="037761_0072_100F0507E729B9F0">
to excite the curio&s;ity of the people who were in the &s;treet, "Charles! my deare&s;t Charles!" ex|claimed &s;he, weeping, imprinted the la&s;t ki&s;s on his cheek, and went &s;lowly home to give her tears time to dry, if po&s;&s;ible. But, alas! when &s;he came to the corner where Ortenberg &s;uddenly was with|drawn from her eyes&mdash;new bitter tears gu&s;hed from her eyes, moi&s;tening the flowing tre&s;&s;es which covered her heaving bo&s;om. She he&s;ita|ted a con&s;iderable time to enter her father's hou&s;e, &s;topping behind one of the linden trees which lined the banks of the canal, warming her hand|kerchief with her breath, and holding it again&s;t her eyes, to di&s;pel the redne&s;s. However, grief and confu&s;ion had di&s;ordered her features &s;o much, and imprinted their ve&s;tiges &s;o deeply upon her countenance, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for her to con|ceal it from the Argus eyes of her father; who a&s;ked her ha&s;tily, as &s;oon as &s;he entered the a|partment: "Good God, Caroline, what is the matter with you? what has happened?"</P>
<P>Caroline had already prepared a plau&s;ible ex|cu&s;e, for the confu&s;ion in which &s;he was; for lo|vers are never in want of excu&s;es on &s;uch emer|gencies. She replied with a tolerable pre&s;ence of mind:</P>
<P>I have been frightened by a drunken man, on coming home. You know, papa, how fearful I am?</P>
<P>The old man took this for &s;terling coin, and Caroline was as glad, as &s;he could be in her &s;i|tuation, to have reached her &s;olitary apartment, where &s;he could give vent to her tears without being interrupted.</P>

<P>THE &s;en&s;ations with which Ortenberg enter|ed his bed-chamber, the la&s;t time, were un&s;peak|ably bitter. He neither would nor could &s;leep. He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the watchman cry the hours, and thought, alas! this is the la&s;t time I &s;hall hear him; he &s;aw how the moon &s;ilvered the tops of the trees in the garden, and thought, alas!

It is &s;ingular, that objects which never intere&s;ted us before, become ex|tremely important to us when we have rea&s;on to apprehend that we &s;hall &s;ee them no more.</P>
<P>The clock &s;truck one. The &s;tage was to &s;et off at three o'clock. Ortenberg rang the bell for the &s;ervant, to make coffee, and in a few minutes, the whole hou&s;e was in a bu&s;tle. His mother al&s;o got up to a&s;&s;i&s;t in preparing her &s;on's breakfa&s;t. Tears &s;tarted from her eyes, as often as &s;he looked at her dear Frederic. "God ble&s;s you, my dear child!" exclaimed &s;he, when &s;he embraced him
<PB N="75" REF="037761_0074_100F050BD0F76240">
the la&s;t time; "God ble&s;s you, and pro&s;per your &s;tudies; walk in the fear of the Lord; have God before your eyes, and in your heart, all your life, and take heed not to &s;in knowingly, nor to com|mit any thing contrary to the law of God. God will grant my prayer, and re&s;tore you one time to my maternal arms, with a pure and innocent heart. Venerate God, do right, fear no one, and my ble&s;&s;ing will follow you every where. But &s;hould you be tempted to &s;tray from the path of virtue, then think of your old affectionate mother, and con&s;ider that you would load me with &s;hame and di&s;grace. Let my grey hair be con&s;igned in peace to the grave. Oh! my &s;on, my &s;on! I am old and infirm; I am afraid I &s;hall &s;ee you no more. Farewell! God ble&s;s you!</P>
<P>Ortenberg could not utter one poor word. He moi&s;tened the trembling hand of his mother with tears of filial love, and flung him&s;elf &s;peechle&s;s into the &s;tage. He pa&s;&s;ed the hou&s;e of his dear Caroline, &s;aw her in the window, dre&s;&s;ed in a charming morning gown, extending her arms to|wards him, as beautiful as the ro&s;eate cloud which ju&s;t emerged from the Ea&s;tern horizon; her eyes were overclouded with grief, like the ri&s;ing &s;un when his orb is &s;hrouded in a thunder-cloud; he made a &s;ignal to her with his hand, which was moi&s;tened with tears, and di&s;appeared. He was &s;carcely in the open field, when all objects which pre&s;ented them&s;elves to his eyes, contributed to render the &s;en&s;ations at parting more painful. The garden in which he unknowingly robbed Caroline of her patch; the terrace, and the tree under which he imprinted the fir&s;t ki&s;s on Caro|line's lips; the lonely walk at the water-&s;ide which he u&s;ed to frequent in his boyi&s;h years: the ver|dant hill where he frequently had played with his juvenile companions; the little wood where

he had laid &s;nares for birds; the lake on which he had &s;kated. "God!" exclaimed he, while all the&s;e objects gradually di&s;appeared from his view. "All this I have, perhaps, &s;een the la&s;t time!" In a &s;hort time he had only an imperfect view of his native town; the &s;tage drove down a hill, and his eyes &s;ought the &s;pot in vain where he had dreamed away his boyi&s;h and juvenile years.</P>
<P>He arrived at the place of his de&s;tination with the firm re&s;olution to be faithful to the advice of his good mother. He kept his word. Nothing remarkable occurred in the two fir&s;t years of his &s;tudies. Caroline and his mother wrote frequent|ly; he neglected not to an&s;wer their letters; and the po&s;t went regularly. We &s;hall, therefore, &s;kip over the two fir&s;t years of his academic life. We al&s;o &s;hall not enlarge much upon the third, and only inform the reader that he, at that time, made an acquaintance which had an important influence on the &s;ub&s;equent occurrences of his life. Har|man of Elhenhor&s;t, an excellent young nobleman, became his friend.&mdash;Although I would advi&s;e every young man of plebeian extraction to choo&s;e, at univer&s;ity, no nobleman for his friend, becau&s;e he would run the ri&s;k of being di&s;carded and ne|glected, after the conclu&s;ion of his academic life; yet Baron Elhenhor&s;t made an exception. He was a native of Cleves, and &s;on of the Prime Mini&s;ter, endowed with uncommon abilities, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing a heart warm for friend&s;hip, but cold for love. Many young men intruded them&s;elves up|on him, and &s;trove to gain his friend&s;hip; becau&s;e&mdash;he was rich. Ortenberg entertained not the lea&s;t thought of ingratiating him&s;elf with him, and gained his friend&s;hip without having &s;ought it. This happened in the following manner.</P>
<P>Not far from the town where they &s;tudied was a pond, where Elhenhor&s;t, Ortenberg, and many
<PB N="77" REF="037761_0076_100F0510E2983380">
more &s;tudents u&s;ed to &s;kate. Ortenberg went one day, about noon, to that place of diver&s;ion, and arrived at the very moment, when, at the farthe&s;t end of the pond, the ice broke under El|henhor&s;t's feet, and he &s;ank into the mire up to his &s;houlders. There was, indeed, no danger be|cau&s;e the pond was not deep: yet every one of my readers will ea&s;ily perceive that the &s;ituation to which Elhenhor&s;t was reduced, was far from being comfortable. A per&s;on who has &s;kates fa&s;tened to his feet, cannot ea&s;ily help him&s;elf, and&mdash;what is &s;till wor&s;e&mdash;the ice always broke when he attempted to work him&s;elf out of the mud. Not a &s;ingle &s;oul was near the &s;pot before Ortenberg arrived, and for this rea&s;on the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance which he endeavoured to give to an utter &s;tranger, although he could not ri&s;k his life, was the more valuable. However, Elhenhor&s;t was obliged to be &s;atisfied with his good intention, for when our young hero ha&s;tened to the &s;pot ra|ther incautiou&s;ly&mdash;as all good natured people are u&s;ed to do when they have an opportunity of a&s;|&s;i&s;ting their fellow creatures&mdash;the ice broke al&s;o under his feet, and he was reduced to the &s;ame &s;ituation from which the Baron had &s;truggled above a quarter of an hour to extricate him&s;elf. Both were half dead with cold, and now began jointly to call for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. This attracted &s;ome people, and they were, at la&s;t, fortunately though covered with mud, half frozen, and &s;lightly wounded in &s;everal parts by the &s;harp edges of the ice, relea&s;ed from their un&s;ea&s;onable bath.</P>
<P>It always grieves me to &s;ee that the great and the little generally are le&s;s grateful when our endea|vours to be u&s;eful to them an&s;wer not our ex|pectations and intention, although our zeal and merit be the &s;ame as if we had &s;ucceeded. El|henhor&s;t, differing in his principles with the ma|jority
<PB N="78" REF="037761_0077_100F051265D8B880">
of his noble brethren, was as much obliged to Ortenberg as if he really had &s;ucceeded in his attempt to relea&s;e him from his uncomfortable &s;i|tuation. The mo&s;t cordial friend&s;hip was ce|mented, from that moment, between the two young men. Sympathy had united their &s;ouls long before that misfortune happened, and acci|dent contracted the ties which nature had pre|pared.&mdash;Propriety! what a trouble&s;ome thing art thou! how often do we &s;ee a face at the &s;ight of which our heart whi&s;pers to us, that man <HI>could</HI> be thy friend, and thou would&s;t love him fervent|ly, <HI>if</HI> he were. However, &s;tiff propriety, pre|vents us from &s;haking him cordially by the hand and proclaiming the wi&s;hes of our heart. He has, perhaps, in that very moment, the &s;ame idea: but if accident does not come to our a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, we part with the cold compliment, "I am happy to have had the honour of making your acquaintance." If accident had not befriended Elhenhor&s;t and Ortenberg, perhaps they would never have been &s;o intimate as they now were. They &s;pent every hour which was not dedicated to their occupations, in confidential di&s;cour&s;es, and many a long winter's evening appeared to them, at the che&s;s-board, as &s;hort as a &s;erene hour in May. Oh friend&s;hip, thou &s;i&s;ter of love! how few are de&s;tined to be warmed by thy gentle fire! every one does, indeed, offer an imaginary &s;acri|fice at thy &s;hrine, but, alas! the majority lay pro|&s;trate at the idol of &s;elf-intere&s;t, which rules all over the world, while they vainly think to &s;acri|fice at thy altar.</P>
<P>Ortenberg now enjoyed a bli&s;s which, hither|to, had been unknown to him. He never had, as yet, ta&s;ted the happine&s;s of communicating his mo&s;t &s;ecret ideas to a faithful friend, of &s;peaking of his love, of pourtraying the idol of his heart
<PB N="79" REF="037761_0078_100F05141172D7B8">
with tho&s;e glowing colours with which Amor's eloquence furni&s;hed him, and, in &s;hort, of enjoy|ing his bli&s;s in a two-fold manner, as he was no longer obliged to conceal it within him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Although Elhenhor&s;t never had loved, nor was inclined to fall in love, yet he li&s;tened kindly, and &s;ometimes &s;miling, to his friend, when he vent|ed the tendere&s;t feelings of his heart with en|thu&s;ia&s;tic warmth: and what a fea&s;t was it for Or|tenberg's love, when Elhenhor&s;t prai&s;ed Caro|line's artle&s;s letters, congratulated his friend up|on being &s;o happy to po&s;&s;e&s;s the heart of a woman who was capable of &s;uch noble &s;entiments and of expre&s;&s;ing them in &s;uch a dignified manner. In &s;hort, congeniality of &s;entiments, principles, and propen&s;ities tied in le&s;s than a year the mo&s;t in|di&s;&s;oluble bonds of friend&s;hip between them. However, all our joys are like a gleam of &s;un|&s;hine in April. The gloomy hour of &s;eparation already drew near: Elhenhor&s;t was to leave Frank|fort on the Oder, and Ortenberg, who had to &s;tay half a year longer was almo&s;t frantic with grief when he thought of the torments of the impend|ing moment of parting.</P>
<P>They &s;upped together in Ortenberg's apart|ment the night before Elhenhor&s;t's departure. They mutually pre&s;&s;ed each other to eat, but their agony was &s;o great as almo&s;t to render it impo&s;|&s;ible for them to &s;wallow. They ro&s;e from table without &s;carcely having touched a mor&s;el. Nei|ther would begin to &s;peak of the impending &s;epa|ration, and the thought of it was, neverthele&s;s, the only one which occupied their &s;ouls entirely, rendering them incapable of thinking of any thing el&s;e, and laming their tongue, as it were, for eve|ry other conver&s;ation. Elhenhor&s;t broke at la&s;t the painful &s;ilence:</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="80" REF="037761_0079_100F05160B16C2A8">
<P>I hope, Ortenberg, you will write very often to me!" &s;aid he, playing with his watch-chain, ca&s;ting his eyes to the ground, to conceal the tears which &s;tarted from them.&mdash;"Undoubtedly!" re|plied Ortenberg with a half-&s;tifled &s;igh; and thus their conver&s;ation was again at an end. A game of che&s;s now was propo&s;ed and begun. But if it be true that this game is the game of kings, and that it bears the mo&s;t &s;triking re&s;emblance to a battle: I would not advi&s;e a king to engage the enemy on a day when he is to be &s;eparated from a dear friend. But how wildly am I talking? what king can &s;ay he has a real friend?&mdash;Our two he|roes played like children, leaving their mo&s;t va|luable men undefended without their being taken; &s;taring &s;ometimes half an hour idly at the board, and forgetting who&s;e turn it was to move. The clock at la&s;t &s;truck ten, and Elhenhor&s;t prepared to depart. "Adieu, dear Elhenhor&s;t!" &s;aid Or|tenberg ha&s;tily, pre&s;&s;ing his hand with convul&s;ive agony: "God ble&s;s and protect you." "We &s;hall &s;ee each other once more to-morrow morn|ing," replied Elhenhor&s;t groaning, and left the apartment.</P>
<P>But no! they did not meet again. Ortenberg fore&s;aw that the final parting &s;cene would be too much for his and his friend's heart, and tend only to make them feel all the pangs of &s;eparation with additional bitterne&s;s. He had, indeed, promi&s;ed to be at Elhenhor&s;t's apartment early next morn|ing; however, he took a walk to a neighbouring village, and only left the following lines.</P>
<P>I am going to take a walk, to avoid taking leave. Farewell, dear Friend. God ble&s;s you! We &s;hall, probably, meet no more in this world. I thank you for the numerous proofs of your

friend&s;hip, which I have received!&mdash;Be com|pletely happy, and forget not</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your ORTENBERG.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>This note was &s;tained with tears, and Elhen|hor&s;t's tears mingled them&s;elves with his. "Good God!" exclaimed he, trembling on &s;tepping into the po&s;t-chai&s;e, while he &s;carcely was able to &s;tand on his feet; "how dear can a worthy friend render even the ob&s;cure&s;t corner to us!"</P>
<P>Oh, how true, how true, is this remark!&mdash;And parting is doubly dreadful, if we know from ex|perience that friend&s;hip, kept up by letters, fre|quently grows cold by degrees, and at la&s;t dies entirely away. Should this world really be the be&s;t?&mdash;and if it were, &s;hould not all good men who meet in it, love each other, and con&s;tantly united, live and act jointly for the good of their brethren? or is this idea too &s;ublime for this world?&mdash;Yes, we &s;hall meet again in a better world, in the regions of purer bli&s;s, to attain, hand in hand, by active virtue, the highe&s;t degree of happine&s;s.</P>
<P>The two friends corre&s;ponded frequently in the beginning. Elhenhor&s;t informed his friend that he had made a journey to Berlin with his father; that he had been pre&s;ented to the king, and been &s;o happy to plea&s;e the monarch; that he, con&s;e|quently, had the be&s;t pro&s;pects before him, and expected to be &s;oon promoted to a very honour|able po&s;t. Ortenberg put the letter ha&s;tily in his pocket, took his hat and cane, running into the &s;treet, and a&s;king all his acquaintances he met, whether they had known Elhenhor&s;t? and when one replied in the affirmative, he informed him with the greate&s;t volubility and &s;parkling eyes, of his friend's impending happine&s;s. However, the
<PB N="82" REF="037761_0081_100F051A66C8D540">
corre&s;pondence of the two friends was &s;uddenly interrupted by a mo&s;t melancholy incident.</P>

<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Frederic,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I &s;hould have been happy to inform you, my dear &s;on, that all is well, and that I am cheerfully looking towards the joyful hour when I &s;hould receive you again in my maternal arms; however, Providence has decreed it otherwi&s;e, and vi&s;ited me with a heavy affliction on the verge of the grave. Yet I ki&s;s the rod which cha&s;ti&s;es me, and pray every day to God to &s;trengthen you, my &s;on, that you may be able to get through the trials which await you. Fate leads us frequently over extremely narrow and rugged roads; however, it al&s;o heals again the wounds which it inflicts. Old Summer, who had the management of our little property, is a bankrupt, and has di&s;appeared. I applied immediately to a lawyer; however, I had the affliction to be informed by him, that I have not the lea&s;t hope to recover any thing. You know that we always placed great confidence in old Summer, and intru&s;ted him with all that we
<PB N="83" REF="037761_0082_100F051BE9A408C0">
are worth, upon a &s;imple bond. The lawyer, de|clares, therefore, that we ought to think our&s;elves happy, if we can recover twenty per cent. and even this, he thinks, will not be paid &s;o &s;oon as we may want it. God knows what will become of us, and how we &s;hall be able to procure the ne|ce&s;&s;aries of life. I will not judge. I am a mer|chant's widow, and know very well that he may be innocent; however, I cannot &s;ee how we &s;hall be able to &s;upport life. I am too old to get my bread by the labour of my hands, and wi&s;h &s;in|cerely God would take me to him. Yet I do not de&s;pair to find an a&s;ylum in the hou&s;e of &s;ome be|nevolent friend, and am only anxious on account of my dear Charles. You cannot conceive how it grieves me to think that you &s;hould not be as happy as you de&s;erve to be. Mi&s;s Summer has called upon me, and complained bitterly of her melancholy &s;ituation. You may ea&s;ily conceive that I pity her &s;incerely. Return as &s;oon as po&s;|&s;ible to your afflicted parent, to a&s;&s;i&s;t me with your advice in my extreme di&s;tre&s;s.

<P>Young Ortenberg's heart was deeply wounded by the contents of this melancholy letter. He &s;tood near half an hour motionle&s;s at the window, holding the fatal letter in his hand. Several peo|ple who pa&s;&s;ed the hou&s;e &s;aluted him; however he &s;aw them not. Some acquaintances of his wi&s;hed him a good morning as they pa&s;&s;ed by; but he heard it not. His mother&mdash;his Caroline&mdash;his mother and him&s;elf, rendered mi&s;erable by the father of his mi&s;tre&s;s&mdash;his Caroline reduced to poverty&mdash;All the&s;e ideas cro&s;&s;ed each other con|&s;tantly, and every one of them imprinted the
<PB N="84" REF="037761_0083_100ED4CE3A832040">
dreadful picture which it contained, deeply upon his mind. At la&s;t he rou&s;ed him&s;elf from his &s;tupor, and collected all his firmne&s;s, to prepare without delay for his departure from Frankfort. He had expected to receive a bill of exchange from his mother, and, con&s;equently, had contract&punc; a debt with his landlord, which amounted to about twenty dollars. He went down &s;tairs, giving a faithful account of his misfortune, and reque&s;ting him to take &s;ome pieces of wearing apparel, in lieu of payment. His landlord, a creditable and hone&s;t trade&s;man, who loved Ortenberg as much as if he had been his own &s;on, li&s;tened with great emotion to his melancholy tale, and prote&s;ted &s;o|lemnly that no power on earth &s;hould prevail up|on him to commit &s;uch a mean action, as he ho|ne&s;tly called it.</P>
<P>"Dear man!" &s;aid Ortenberg, "this will do me no good; for I mu&s;t &s;ell part of my clothes to rai&s;e, at lea&s;t, as much money as I &s;hall want for my journey."</P>
<P>"Dear &s;ir!" replied, the landlord, "it grieves me to &s;ee that you place &s;o little confidence in me. Would it not have done more credit to you, if you had come down &s;tairs and &s;aid, land|lord, I am in &s;uch and &s;uch a &s;ituation; I &s;hould be glad if you could lend me a sew paltry dollars. Is it worth while to make many words about &s;uch a trifle? No, no! Mr. Ortenberg, I &s;hall not &s;uf|fer you to &s;ell any of your clothes. You owe me twenty dollars; I will give you thirty more, if you will give me a bond for fifty. I am &s;ure you will pay me, as &s;oon as it is convenient to you."</P>
<P>Having &s;aid this, he put his hand in his pocket, took a key out of a leather pur&s;e, and was going to open his bureau, to prove that he was &s;erious in his offer. But Ortenberg, deeply affected by the genero&s;ity of that worthy man, &s;topped him.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="037761_0084_100F051E53B2BD68">
"No, my worthy friend," &s;aid he, with tears in his eyes: "my clothes are of no further u&s;e to me. Have I not told you, that I am poor? What occa&s;ion have I in my pre&s;ent &s;ituation for coats laced with gold? I have &s;tudied theology, and, con&s;equently, mu&s;t dre&s;s according to cu&s;tom, as &s;oon as I am returned to my native town, and wear black or &s;ome other mode&s;t colour. I have as little occa&s;ion for my gold watch and my &s;ilver|hilted &s;word. I entreat you to take my &s;carlet coat, laced with gold, and the blue one, laced with &s;ilver, in lieu of payment. If you will lend me thirty dollars, I &s;hall take it as a great favour; but in&s;i&s;t upon pawning my watch with you for that &s;um."</P>
<P>They di&s;puted a great while before they could agree, and Ortenberg was, at la&s;t, prevailed upon, to give one of his laced coats, in lieu of payment, and to take the thirty dollars upon the other till he &s;hould be able to redeem it.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, on this occa&s;ion, that pride is a fault which my readers henceforth will frequent|ly ob&s;erve in Ortenberg, a fault which poverty alone can excu&s;e, and which ought to be found only among the poor.</P>
<P>"Farewell!" &s;aid the hone&s;t citizen, when Or|tenberg got into the &s;tage. "God protect you, and pro&s;per all your undertakings. Do not pa&s;s my hou&s;e, if you ever &s;hould come through Frank|&s;ort, and forget not that I love you as a &s;on."</P>
<P>Ortenberg could not utter a word. He rode through the town gate, immer&s;ed in gloomy apa|thy. In the &s;uburbs he pa&s;&s;ed through a &s;treet in which a new hou&s;e had been built, over the door of which were engraven the words, <HI>This house is in the hand of the Lord.</HI> This was the fir&s;t object that produced again an idea in his &s;oul. "God!" thought he: "if that lifele&s;s &s;tructure be de&s;erv|ing
<PB N="86" REF="037761_0085_100F0520492FB328">
of thy protection, my fate mu&s;t al&s;o be in thy hand. I will not complain, nor murmur; your ways are often dark and thorny, however the goal&mdash;although it &s;hould pre&s;ent it&s;elf fir&s;t beyond the grave&mdash;will be worth the &s;trife." Alas! poor young man, the bittere&s;t &s;trife awaits thee yet.</P>
<P>It began to dawn when he beheld the walls of his native town again. He alighted at the po&s;t|hou&s;e, and ha&s;tened immediately to his mother's abode. The windows were open, which appear|ed unaccountable to him, as the cold &s;till was pret|ty &s;evere. Merciful God!&mdash;when he entered the hou&s;e&mdash;he beheld his mother in her coffin. A &s;cene like this cannot be de&s;cribed; and I &s;hall leave the melancholy ta&s;k to the imagination and feelings of my readers. His mother had left a letter for him. He opened it impatiently, and read:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Frederic,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I perceived clearly that you will not be able to arrive &s;o &s;oon as my &s;anguine wi&s;hes flattered me you would. I am &s;en&s;ible that God has heard my prayers, and will take me from this world in a few days. Rejoice, my dear &s;on, rejoice with me at my impending di&s;&s;olution. Nothing em|bitters my death but the idea that the &s;ituation in which I leave you, is not as good as I &s;hould wi&s;h and you de&s;erve. However, you have learnt &s;omething; tru&s;t in God, and he will direct all for the be&s;t. Confidence in God, my dear &s;on, leads to happine&s;s here and hereafter. Mi&s;s Summer has been with me &s;everal days, and at|tended and nur&s;ed me. The good child frets ve|ry much at the injury which her father has done to me. However, it is not her fault, and I have not arraigned her for it. Neither, I hope,
<PB N="87" REF="037761_0086_100F0522379F78B0">
will you, my dear &s;on. She now is, indeed, re|duced to poverty; however, &s;he is of a laborious turn, and fears God. I give you my maternal ble&s;&s;ing, if you ever &s;hould be able to marry her. God ble&s;s you, and make you happy here and hereafter. Amen. If my elde&s;t &s;on, Nicolaus, ever &s;hould return again, you may tell him that I ble&s;&s;ed him on my death-bed, and that I quit this world without entertaining the lea&s;t re&s;ent|ment again&s;t him. I hope you will bury me in the vault where the remains of my dear hu&s;band are entombed. God knows, I always intended to leave a &s;mall legacy to the poor; but the Lord who gave it, has taken it again; prai&s;ed be his holy name. I &s;hould, indeed, have wi&s;hed to hear you preach once before my death; however, God has denied me that plea&s;ure; I &s;ubmit to his paternal will. I now &s;hall lay down the pen, after having bid you once more adieu; for, I am &s;o weak as not to be able to write another line.</P>

<P>The &s;oul of the young man was rent with the mo&s;t excruciating agony, while he peru&s;ed the&s;e mournful lines; one tear cha&s;ed the other, and convul&s;ive groans deprived him of the power of utterance. He indulged his grief five mournful days in his lonely habitation, without knowing what he was doing. Five melancholy days elap&s;|ed without his having even inquired after his equally unfortunate Caroline. No one came near him but an old maid &s;ervant, who had known him when a child, and &s;hared happine&s;s and mi&s;|fortune many years with his family. She in|formed him, at la&s;t, of her own accord, that Ca|roline had entered into the &s;ervice of an old la|dy,
<PB N="88" REF="037761_0087_100F052431189A80">
as waiting-woman, and had been in the hou&s;e the day before his arrival, to &s;ee his mo|ther's corp&s;e once more. She added &s;he had wept bitterly, but &s;eemed to be pretty well recon|ciled to her new &s;ituation.</P>
<P>Ortenberg &s;carcely had heard this account, when his love for Caroline returned again with redoubled force. He di&s;patched the &s;ervant in|&s;tantly, to let her know that he intended to pay her a vi&s;it. During the &s;ervant's ab&s;ence he felt for the fir&s;t time that &s;weet anxiety, that anxious throbbing of heart, which every young man will have felt while he looked impatiently and trem|bling at the watch, counting every minute till the wi&s;hed-for moment arrived. Ortenberg ob&s;erv|ed, for the fir&s;t time, that his &s;ervant was uncom|monly &s;low, that &s;he crept like a &s;nail, and was very unfit to be employed as a <HI>Postillon d' amour.</HI> She returned at la&s;t, and delivered a &s;ealed note, which contained the following lines.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Caroline was no romantic heroine. She had a humane heart; but this and weakne&s;s, are almo&s;t in&s;eparable. It was with the greate&s;t difficulty &s;he had wrote the afore-mentioned letter to Or|tenberg. She had not expected to receive &s;uch a wild, de&s;pairing an&s;wer, and therefore was not able to per&s;i&s;t in her re&s;olution. Do not con|demn her, ye fair ones, for not having been gift|ed with enthu&s;ia&s;tic punctilio; I would lay any|thing, that not one of you would have acted otherwi&s;e in a &s;imilar &s;ituation. Caroline &s;ent word to Ortenberg, that &s;he expected to &s;ee him at ten o'clock the next morning.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the fir&s;t &s;torm had abated, and the lovers were again able to ca&s;t the anchor of rea|&s;on, they began to look out for a &s;afe port, to which they could &s;teer with united exertion. How|ever, men think and meditate frequently with un|abating a&s;&s;iduity, and when they imagine they have found out &s;omething entirely new, generally hit upon an object which would have pre&s;ented it&s;elf to their view, at fir&s;t &s;ight, if they but had had eyes to &s;ee it. Ortenberg and Caroline had been clo&s;eted and con&s;ulting above two hours, when they agreed that Ortenberg &s;hould apply to the con&s;i&s;tory, to examine, and qualify him for
<PB N="91" REF="037761_0090_100F052A9E4F8968">
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a living, and that Caroline &s;hould remain in the &s;ervice of her lady, till this wi&s;h|ed for object was attained. The lady rung the bell, and Caroline intimated to Ortenberg, that it was time for him to go, but made him promi&s;e, before he went, to vi&s;it her only once every week, le&s;t he &s;hould expo&s;e her to the calumny of bu&s;y go&s;&s;ips. The condition was, indeed, very pain|ful; however, he was &s;ufficiently indemnified for his &s;elf-denial, when the long wi&s;hed for Sun|day came, and Ortenberg, could rove his native fields, by the &s;ide of his dear Caroline. No routs nor &s;plendid fea&s;ts can afford plea&s;ures like tho&s;e which he felt on the&s;e occa&s;ions. Oh Heavens, what a &s;cene of bli&s;s would it afford, if it were po&s;&s;ible to e&s;tabli&s;h a club con&s;i&s;ting entirely of lovers&mdash;provided the number were even.</P>

<P>HALF a year had now elap&s;ed! Ortenberg was examined before the whole con&s;i&s;tory, re|ceived much well merited applau&s;e, and at la&s;t
<PB N="92" REF="037761_0091_100F052C92DEEEC0">
was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, with the &s;tronge&s;t promi&s;es of be|ing promoted to the fir&s;t living that &s;hould be|come vacant. However, the&s;e reverend gentle|men, know after the next quarter of an hour, as little of their promi&s;es made to an hone&s;t fellow not to let him &s;tarve, as the crutch knows that the lame leans upon it. Ortenberg knew this by the experience of others. He therefore did not think it prudent to expend the &s;mall &s;um which he had obtained by &s;elling &s;ome u&s;ele&s;s furniture, and to rely implicitly upon the faith of his reve|rend patrons. He made &s;everal attempts to ob|tain the place of a tutor. But wearing his own hair, contrary to the cu&s;tom of all divines of his times; his endeavours were entirely fruitle&s;s, and he &s;aw him&s;elf nece&s;&s;iated to keep an ob&s;cure day &s;chool, in which he in&s;tructed the children of trades people, for a &s;mall monthly &s;tipend.</P>
<P>Ortenberg earned by that de&s;pi&s;ed though ho|nourable occupation, &s;carcely as much as was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;upport his life. The confu&s;ion in which the death of his mother had involved him, the preparation for his examination, and the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of his &s;chool, had hitherto taken up the greate&s;t part of his time, and cau&s;ed him to leave two of Elhenhor&s;t's letters unan&s;wered. Elhen|hor&s;t knew not what to think of his &s;ilence, and wrote a long epi&s;tle to his &s;ilent friend&mdash;in which he loudly complained of his &s;uppo&s;ed neglect, and murmured at his own melancholy fate.</P>
<P>Grief and unea&s;ine&s;s really overclouded poor Elhenhor&s;t's days. He had obtained the po&s;t which the king had promi&s;ed him. He acquired honour and wealth, and had rea&s;on to hope to ri&s;e higher in a &s;hort time. However, his &s;u|periors, &s;eeing that he di&s;charged his duty with unremitted zeal, had burthened him with &s;uch a load of bu&s;ine&s;s, as left him little time for recre|ation.
<PB N="93" REF="037761_0092_100F052E159953D0">
If a young man who is buried the whole week among a heap of du&s;ty documents, and has even on a Sunday only a few hours to &s;pare, which he is doomed to kill at the card table,&mdash;if &s;uch a young man is not to complain, he really mu&s;t be as unfeeling as a block, and de&s;titute of all noble &s;entiments.</P>
<P>Ortenberg was deeply affected by the melan|choly epi&s;tle of his friend. He an&s;wered it im|mediately, imputing his long &s;ilence to the death of his mother, and his public examination. He mentioned, indeed, that he had lo&s;t all his pro|perty through old Summer's bankruptcy, but was too proud to complain, or to drop only a &s;ingle word about the utter want of the nece&s;&s;aries of life, to which he frequently was reduced. He a&s;&s;ured his friend, on the contrary, that he want|ed for nothing; that he was in hopes of attain|ing a comfortable living, and &s;hould &s;oon be hap|py in the arms of his Caroline. Thus their cor|re&s;pondence had been taken up again, and was carried on regularly till Elhenhor&s;t's untimely death interrupted it.</P>
<P>Caroline had the misfortune to get acquainted with a wretch who poi&s;oned all the plea&s;ures of her life, and rendered it an almo&s;t uninterrupted train of mi&s;ery. The lady in who&s;e &s;ervice &s;he was, was a proud conceited fool, a puppet with|out a &s;oul, who had no other merit but that which &s;he derived from her pedigree, and entertained a very &s;u&s;picious connection with a certain Colonel, whom we already have introduced to our readers on a former occa&s;ion. As the principal aim of the robu&s;t Colonel and the wanton lady tended entirely to enjoy the world, and to give variety to their plea&s;ures, <HI>he</HI> was always provided with pro|mi&s;ing men &s;ervants, and <HI>she</HI> took care never to be without a pretty waiting maid, which enabled
<PB N="94" REF="037761_0093_100F053082B47D58">
them to a&s;&s;i&s;t each other in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity. She had not informed Caroline of this honourable de|&s;tination, becau&s;e &s;he imagined this was entirely &s;uperfluous, and, be&s;ides, took it for granted, that a young woman in her humble &s;ituation would be proud of having a Colonel, who, be&s;ides, was a nobleman, for an admirer.</P>
<P>Caroline was &s;itting in her apartment, on a hot &s;ummer's day, thinly attired, on account of the intolerable heat. The Colonel, who had not found her lady at home, entered her chamber, and &s;eated him&s;elf oppo&s;ite her, a&s;&s;ailing the blu&s;hing girl with jokes, to which no cha&s;te ear can li&s;ten without indignation. A look of Caroline's fla&s;h|ing eye, which could have confounded impudence it&s;elf, lamed his tongue a few moments. How|ever, heroes of the toilet like him are not ea&s;ily frightened. "The fortre&s;s is beautiful!" ex|claimed he, with a &s;elf-&s;ufficient &s;mile: "I mu&s;t &s;torm it!"</P>
<P>Having &s;aid this, he extended his hand, to re|move Caroline's neck handkerchief. Caroline &s;tarted up, anger and contempt glowed in her countenance.</P>

<P>My lady, unfortunately, had di&s;ordered her head-dre&s;s, in alighting, and rung the bell for her woman.&mdash;(The Colonel had already &s;neaked away.) Caroline appeared, her eyes red with crying. The Barone&s;s perceived it in the looking-gla&s;s, before which &s;he was &s;tanding, examining the damage which her coeffure had received; for, &s;he was not u&s;ed to conde&s;cend honouring her woman with a look. "Why have you been crying?" a&s;ked &s;he negligently. "The Colonel," replied Caroline, while a torrent of tears gu&s;hed from her eyes, "has treated me like the mo&s;t abandoned woman."</P>

</SP>
<P>So &s;aying, &s;he went to the harp&s;ichord, and played a country-dance, without taking any further notice of Caroline, who went in an agony of de&s;pair to her apartment, and moi&s;tened her knitting with tears.</P>
<P>Ortenberg, unfortunately, came that very mo|moment, contrary to his u&s;ual cu&s;tom, to pay her a vi&s;it, informing her, with a cheerful countenance that he was in hopes to obtain a comfortable living in a &s;hort time. The words died on his lips when he perceived her woeful &s;ituation. We &s;hall not inquire whether Caroline did right or wrong in in|forming him of the in&s;ult which &s;he had &s;uffered from the Colonel and her lady. Suffice it to &s;ay, that &s;he repre&s;ented her forlorn &s;ituation faithfully to him; that &s;he had no other friend be&s;ides him, that he entreated her in the mo&s;t affectionate man|ner to conceal nothing from him; and that &s;he thought her connexion with him required the mo&s;t unre&s;erved confidence.

<P>ORTENBERG's heart was torn with the mo&s;t excruciating agony during Caroline's relation. It was impo&s;&s;ible a proud and noble mind like his could have brooked &s;uch a daring and &s;hameful in|&s;ult. He was &s;eized, for the fir&s;t time in his life, with frantic fury. His eyes rolled wildly in their &s;ockets, his veins &s;welled, and his nerves were convul&s;ed. He ru&s;hed out of the apartment, with|out li&s;tening to Caroline's anxious &s;creams, &s;tagger|ed, inebriated with fury, through the &s;treet, and was almo&s;t &s;en&s;ele&s;s when he entered his apart|ment. He wrapped him&s;elf in a long cloak, con|cealing a ru&s;ty &s;word under it, and flew to the Colonel's hou&s;e. The latter was not at home, and Ortenberg mea&s;ured the anti-chamber with ha&s;ty &s;trides, firmly re&s;olved not to quit the hou&s;e, until he &s;hould have avenged Caroline's injury. He
<PB N="98" REF="037761_0097_100F05390C907DE0">
waited a long time for the Colonel, and con&s;equent|ly had time to recover from his blood-thir&s;ty frenzy. A thou&s;and doubts began to cro&s;s each other in his mind. He began to reflect on the fatal con&s;equences which this action would unavoidably produce; he &s;huddered at the idea of murdering a fellow-creature, or depriving Caroline, by his own death, of her only protector, and his re&s;olu|tion began to waver, his blood grew cooler, and he was already on the point of quitting the hou&s;e, when the Colonel entered the anti-chamber. The &s;ight of that unfeeling wretch overturned at once all his good re&s;olutions. His blood began again to ferment violently, and he followed his rival to his clo&s;et. The Colonel &s;tarted on &s;eeing a man in his clo&s;et, who was an utter &s;tranger to him, and who&s;e eyes fla&s;hed with an unu&s;ual ferocity.</P>

<P>Ortenberg could contain him&s;elf no longer. "Villain! defend your&s;elf!" exclaimed he, flying furiou&s;ly at the Colonel. The latter &s;carcely had
<PB N="100" REF="037761_0099_100F055C393971D0">
time to draw his &s;word and to hold it again&s;t the furious young man. But more was not wanting for his defence. Ortenberg being blinded by rage and un&s;killed in fencing, ran into the Colonel's &s;word and received a deep wound in the abdomen, which however was not mortal. "You &s;ee what it is to be too ha&s;ty!" &s;aid the Colonel, &s;neering, and rung for his valet. A &s;urgeon was &s;ent for: Ortenberg's wound was dre&s;&s;ed, and the Colonel &s;ent him home in his carriage.</P>
<P>This incident is the mo&s;t evident proof that my tale is no fiction; for if it were, Ortenberg would have pierced the Colonel like a &s;econd Grandi&s;on, and kicked all his &s;ervants valiantly down &s;tairs.

<P>With the&s;e words he &s;kipped out of the apart|ment, &s;troking his calves, whi&s;tling an air, taking

a looking gla&s;s out of his pocket to admire his pretty face, and went into Caroline's chamber. The unfortunate girl was ju&s;t upon her knees in a corner of her chamber, imploring Providence to pre&s;erve her innocence and to protect her lover.</P>
<P>It was dangerous for the Colonel to &s;ee a per|&s;on at prayers, becau&s;e he always apprehended on &s;uch occa&s;ions to be choaked. He rai&s;ed a roar|ing hor&s;e-laugh. Caroline turned round, ca&s;ting a contemptuous look at the wild wretch, and was going to quit the apartment. The Colonel &s;topt her.</P>
<P>"Stop a little, my angel! I &s;hall &s;oon have done (laughing violently). Let me only recover a little (laughing &s;till louder); 'pon my honour, this is too bad!" continued he with tears in his eye and &s;labbering lips: "a girl eighteen years old&mdash;one &s;hould expect to find her before the looking gla&s;s&mdash;or reading <HI>les egaremens du coeur</HI>&mdash;or writing a <HI>Billet-doux</HI>&mdash;and, lo! &s;he prays!" <STAGE>(he almo&s;t was choaked with laughing).</STAGE></P>

<P>He kept hold of her hands and informed her of Ortenberg's accident.</P>
<P>When he had told her he had run him through, Caroline ejaculated a loud &s;cream, and was rea|dy to faint. However, her apprehen&s;ion for her lover's life &s;oon animated her again with new

&s;trength. She hit the Colonel a violent blow a|gain&s;t the brea&s;t, which made him reel.</P>
<P>"Ortenberg wounded!" exclaimed &s;he: "God cur&s;e you, vile villain!" She ru&s;hed into the &s;treet undre&s;&s;ed as &s;he was. Not a thought of propriety came into her mind; Ortenberg's wound was con&s;tantly before her eyes; &s;he &s;eemed to fly, and before five minutes had elap&s;ed, &s;tood trembling at Ortenberg's bed &s;ide.</P>
<P>"Charles!"</P>
<P>"Caroline!"</P>
<P>She was dragged from the bed. The poor young man was &s;ufficiently tormented by agoni|&s;ing ideas; her compa&s;&s;ionate and almo&s;t frantic love would have killed him in that moment. Ca|roline was not admitted again before the &s;eventh day, when he began to mend. They moaned, wept and &s;ighed together; however there was no remedy again&s;t this misfortune.</P>
<P>Caroline had quitted the hou&s;e of the Baron|e&s;s immediately, and, in the &s;implicity of her in|nocent heart, entered into the &s;ervice of an old woman, who was thought to be a lady of rank, and concealed the mo&s;t contemptible &s;oul under the ma&s;k of artificial piety. Envy and avarice were the principal ingredients of her character, and varni&s;hed with canting devotion&mdash;She was formerly a coquette, and now a procure&s;s, when a young rake had &s;ufficient money to bribe her. She went frequently to church, &s;ung the mo&s;t &s;o|norous di&s;cant in the whole pari&s;h, and her eyes were red with crying in the drie&s;t &s;ermon. She boa&s;ted much of her exemplary piety, and pre|tended to conver&s;e with &s;uperior &s;pirits. She even &s;ank never into the arms of a lover at the time when &s;he acted the part of a wanton co|quette with applau&s;e, without a&s;&s;uring him with tears in her eyes, that he was the fir&s;t man upon
<PB N="103" REF="037761_0102_100F05408AC22A68">
whom &s;he be&s;towed her favours conquered by the omnipotence of love. She was a mo&s;t garrulous talker, and knew the art of di&s;tending and en|larging &s;o much upon the mo&s;t trifling incident, as if it were a piece of ela&s;tic yarn and her au|ditors marble &s;tatues of patience. She had read the bible above &s;eventy times, and the revelation of St. John 133 times. She kept a faithful jour|nal of every thing that happened in the town and in her hou&s;e, &s;ubjoining always pious remarks to it. As &s;he was proud to &s;how that journal to every one that wi&s;hed to &s;ee it, I think giving a few &s;amples of it to the reader will not be deem|ed an act of indi&s;cretion:</P>
<P>May 16. At four o'clock in the afternoon my next door neighbour's chimney was on fire, which, however, unfortunately, was &s;oon extingui&s;hed. Oh my merciful Saviour, extingui&s;h the confla|gration of his &s;ins, le&s;t he &s;hould be hurled down into the eternal fire from whence there is no re|demption.</P>
<P>May 20. Sewed pea&s;e. Oh, thou Holy Father in Heaven, extirpate the thi&s;tle out of the &s;inful hearts of my fellow chri&s;tians and &s;ow the pea&s;e of thy grace into them.</P>
<P>June 1. Fini&s;hed the peru&s;al of the Old Te&s;ta|ment the &s;eventy-fourth time. Oh, thou Hea|venly Father, be merciful unto thy unworthy &s;er|vant Anna Maria of Xantippendale, that &s;he may be able to glorify thy name, and to edify thy &s;in|ful neighbours by reading it as many times again.</P>
<P>July 13. Had my whole hou&s;e white-wa&s;hed. Oh, thou Holy Father in Heaven, wa&s;h away the manyfold &s;ins of my proud neighbour; le&s;t Satan &s;hould put her one time into his large wa&s;h tub.</P>
<P>July 23. Bought Ea&s;t Indian handkerchiefs. Oh, thou bloody Saviour, &s;ave the poor Indians
<PB N="104" REF="037761_0103_100F0542E8CE1350">
from the clutches of Satan; for, they know no|thing of the incarnate Godhead.</P>
<P>Aug. 2. Heard a very edifying di&s;cour&s;e on Chri&s;tian &s;elf-denial, preached by the Rev. <HI>Dr. Hornbelly,</HI> during which I had &s;hed many thou|&s;ands of tears. Mrs. Wolman, that wicked wo|man, &s;at at my right hand without &s;hedding one poor tear of contrition. God judge that proud woman! &s;he put a hard dollar into the plate for the poor orphans, out of mere vanity.</P>
<P>Aug. 15. Took Mi&s;s Summer into the hou&s;e. Oh, thou Supporter of widows and orphans, move the compa&s;&s;ion of men, that they may commi&s;e|rate the &s;ituation of that pretty child, and my cha|rity bear fruits hundred and thou&s;and fold.</P>
<P>Sept. 1. Had the misfortune to draw blood in beating a &s;ick beggar girl, while I cha&s;ti&s;ed her with Chri&s;tian meekne&s;s, to make her &s;en&s;ible that &s;he &s;hould not beg alms for her blind father and her&s;elf, of a poor woman like me. The wicked ju&s;tice &s;entenced me to pay a fine of 20 dollars, for which my merciful father in heaven will damn him here and hereafter.</P>
<P>Sep. 9. Old Meyer, the merchant, broke a leg. A vi&s;ible judgment of God; becau&s;e he is &s;o rich, and a devoted &s;lave to his mammon.</P>
<P>Oct. 6. The lightning &s;truck into the church of St. Andrew, and damaged the pew of Lady D. Oh, thou wonderful Je&s;us! the wicked wo|man had left it an hour before.</P>
<P>Dec. 1. Killed a pig. Oh, thou lovely Je&s;us! convert the impious Jews, that they may eat pork. Amen.</P>
<P>This will be &s;ufficient for my readers to form an idea of a character, which was a mixture of malice and ab&s;urdity; the former was concealed by the latter, like an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, who is di&s;gui&s;ed by the ma&s;k of a faun. The gentle Caroline
<PB N="105" REF="037761_0104_100F0544AF2945D0">
ima|gined only that &s;he was a &s;ingular woman, to who&s;e oddities &s;he mu&s;t accommodate her&s;elf; and al|though &s;he did not reli&s;h her mode of life, which was occupied with nothing el&s;e but praying, &s;ing|ing, &s;colding, railing again&s;t the wicked world, cur&s;ing the impudence of beggars, complaining of the dearne&s;s of provi&s;ions; ra&s;ping tobacco, and combing dogs; yet &s;he thought her&s;elf &s;uffi|ciently happy to be free from all per&s;ecutions, and to wait for the developement of her fate in retire|ment from the bu&s;tle of the world.</P>
<P>Ortenberg now had completely recovered from his wound. The Colonel had not failed to pro|claim his prowe&s;s in all companies, and to repre|&s;ent the unfortunate young man in the mo&s;t ridi|culous light. The children pointed with their fingers at Ortenberg when he went abroad the fir&s;t time. "Be patient, my poor heart," &s;aid he by him&s;elf: "The living which I am to have, will indemnify me for all my &s;ufferings. I &s;hall not care for all the world, when I am hou&s;ed in my peaceful par&s;onage with my dear Caroline; I will perform my duties faithfully, love my pa|ri&s;honers, cheri&s;h my wife, and live happy, quiet and unenvied, enjoying the ble&s;&s;ings of God with a grateful heart."</P>
<P>Poor, deluded man!</P>
<P>He re&s;olved to apply the next day to all the reverend gentlemen who had to di&s;po&s;e of his fate, and to remind them of their promi&s;es. How|ever, before we proceed farther, my duty as a bi|ographer requires, I &s;hould make my readers ac|quainted with the characters of the reverend pa|trons of our hero.</P>

<P>HIS Excellency Baron Alexander, of Stur|zenburzel, was pre&s;ident of the Con&s;i&s;tory. He was famous for &s;peaking little and eating much. He never went to the court of Con&s;i&s;tory with|out having his pockets &s;tored with cakes. He generally fell a&s;leep as &s;oon as he had fini&s;hed his la&s;t cake, and when he awoke, &s;aid <HI>Yes.</HI> This is all that we can &s;ay of him.</P>
<P>Further: The Right Reverend Father in God, Jo&s;eph Lactantius Ignatius Hog&s;tyerius, Bi&s;hop of D**, and member of &s;even Academies of Sci|ences, and of twenty-two Latin and German So|cieties. He was a man after God's own heart, who was not for external pomp, but humbly, and with &s;elf denial, walked the thorny path of life. He was &s;ix feet three inches high, and the dia|meter of his venerable belly, was two feet five inches. A large wig as white as &s;now, contra&s;t|ed plea&s;antly and awfully with his black beard and eye-brows. His gait was graced with Spa|ni&s;h grandezza. One of his hands reclined upon the abovementioned venerable belly when he walk|ed
<PB N="107" REF="037761_0106_100F0549AB498B00">
in the &s;treet, while the other di&s;pen&s;ed the benediction to the multitude. The writings which immortalized his name, con&s;i&s;ted in a Po|lemic of 37 quarto volumes, 134 Di&s;&s;ertations, and 572 Sermons again&s;t the plea&s;ures of the Fle&s;h.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Flavia Ro&s;amunda Shnurr was a fatherle&s;s and motherle&s;s orphan, 43 years old. She had known the venerable prelate when he was a can|didate, and always received many &s;piritual and corporeal benefactions from him. She now had &s;uperintended his hou&s;e and kitchen more than &s;eventeen years, and was a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the di&s;charge of her dome&s;tic duties, by five foundlings who had been &s;ound at different times at the door of the pious man, and owed their education to his Chri|&s;tian charity. Further:</P>
<P>The Reverend Godfrey Godhart Godhelp Fear|god Blockheadius, Archdeacon of St. Bernard, whom his mother had qualified for a Saint from his bapti&s;m, by the number of Godly names which he received. He was a little man; his face was broad, and his eyes were always half clo&s;ed. They flowed with tears at the &s;ins and wicked|ne&s;s of men, whenever he opened them. His whole life was devoted to mourning at the de|pravity of the world. For this rea&s;on, he had al&s;o a prevailing predilection for the black colour. His wig was black, the face of his wife was of a blacki&s;h hue, his arm chair was covered black, and his dome&s;tic animals con&s;i&s;ted of a black cat, a black dog, a black cock, black cows and hor&s;es, and his favourite di&s;h was black pudding.</P>
<P>The fourth arbiter of Ortenberg's fate was the Reverend Doctor Fip&s;no&s;ius, two feet eight inch|es high, very meagre, gifted with a &s;queaking voice, and graced with a large protuberence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his left &s;houlder. He &s;eemed to look at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">

buckles when he rai&s;ed his eyes to Heaven, and he appeared to be a dwarf when he &s;tood by the &s;ide of the Right Reverend Father in God Lec|tantius Ignatius Hog&s;tyerius. He was very proud of his preaching ex-tempore. He wore a well powdered wig, and as the pulpit was rather high, his pre&s;ence could be perceived only by a cloud of powder which ro&s;e from his head, as often as he &s;hook it in the heat of eloquence. Through this cloud a reprimanding voice was heard, pro|claiming howling, and gna&s;hing of teeth to his pari&s;honers. He imitated that howling &s;o natu|rally, as to make his auditors imagine they heard the damned moaning in full chorus. He was al|ways willing to lend upon pledges, "becau&s;e," &s;aid he, "we are commanded by &s;cripture not to bury our talents." When Ortenberg came to him, he had ju&s;t fini&s;hed a Sermon upon the parable of the rich publican.</P>
<P>The la&s;t per&s;on with who&s;e character we have to acquaint the reader, is the Reverend <HI>Doctor Theologiae et Philosophae,</HI> Olearius Mauritius Calfs|headius. Famine and his per&s;on &s;eemed to be twins. His chin was one of the longe&s;t in the whole kingdom, and his body &s;eemed to be a liv|ing &s;keleton. His bones rattled when he lifted up his hand, and tho&s;e that came near him could ea&s;ily count his ribs. His Sermons were gene|rally lectures upon the Syriac and Chaldean. The&s;e languages occupied his ideas &s;o much that he, one time, in his ab&s;ence of mind, read the go&s;pel of the paralytic, and held a &s;ermon on the golden calf. Another time he was &s;ent for to the hou&s;e of a &s;ick per&s;on, but being ju&s;t occu|pied with finding out the root of a Syriac word, he went by mi&s;take into a hou&s;e of bad fame, where he in&s;tantly was &s;urrounded by three ladies of plea&s;ure. He awoke at la&s;t from his Syriac
<PB N="109" REF="037761_0108_100F054D291B9EE0">
reverie, and fled with horror from that abode of infamy. However, the neighbours who had &s;een him go in, &s;hook their heads with indignation, and exclaimed "Good God, what bu&s;ine&s;s had our pa&s;tor in a brothel?" Dame Fame had &s;pread this news all over the town before a quarter of an hour had elap&s;ed. "Have you heard of it?" &s;aid an old toothle&s;s matron to a neighbour. "For goodne&s;s &s;ake don't mention it; it grieves me to think of that &s;candalous incident."</P>
<P>"Such an old man ought to be a&s;hamed to go to a public &s;tew."</P>
<P>"Merciful Heaven, what a &s;candal!" exclaim|ed the Right Reverend Father Hog&s;tyerius. "Make no provi&s;ion for the fle&s;h, to fulfil the lu&s;ts thereof," &s;aid he to Mi&s;s Flavia Ro&s;amunda Shnurr.</P>
<P>"I thought it would come to that!" groaned the Archdeacon Blockheadius; "the world is verging towards di&s;&s;olution!" "Indeed, it does!" &s;queaked Doctor Fip&s;no&s;ius, while he was occu|pied in filling &s;ome ducats. The poor, guiltle&s;s Calf&s;headius was &s;ummoned before the tribunal of his colleagues, and would have been &s;u&s;pend|ed from office, if he had not proved that it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to vi&s;it a hou&s;e of plea&s;ure for carnal purpo&s;es.</P>

<P>I HAVE given a faithful picture of the vene|rable &s;upporters of the church, on who&s;e nods our heroe's &s;ate depended. Ortenberg, dre&s;&s;ed in his be&s;t black &s;uit, from which the old faithful &s;er|vant carefully had bru&s;hed every atom of du&s;t, his unpowdered hair curled into a round &s;welling lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">k, &s;tepped, with every mark of &s;upplicating humility in his countenance, to the gilt portal of his Excellency Baron of Sturzenburzel. Orten|berg's pride &s;ubmitted this time willingly to the bitter nece&s;&s;ity of mea&s;uring an anti-chamber with humble &s;teps. Our hero who always trembled with indignation at the name of a para&s;ite of the great, imagined that now he was doing nothing but to what he was intitled by the public proofs which he had given of his abilities. Poor, de|luded young man! Right depends upon power: power upon gold, and the gold is in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of malicious fools.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="037761_0110_100F055221E46828">
"They have promi&s;ed it to me," &s;aid Orten|berg by him&s;elf. Unexperienced youth! go and build thy hou&s;e upon &s;and; but re&s;t not thy hopes upon the promi&s;es of the great. The wind which a fly produces by the motion of her wing, is &s;uf|ficient to overturn all thy airy ca&s;tles.</P>
<P>The hope of being ble&s;&s;ed with Caroline's hand, finally conquered all difficulties which Ortenberg's pride threw in his way.</P>
<P>A Swi&s;s, dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;carlet livery, decked with gold, &s;tood at the portal. His plump hands were negligently folded on his back. His thick head &s;corned to return a kind nod to the &s;tran|ger's &s;alutation, and his greedy eyes &s;tared at Ortenberg's hands; but alas! they were as emp|ty as his pockets. "My lord is not at home!" grunted the hireling. Ortenberg perceived the pre&s;ident's head in that very moment at one of the windows of the dining room, and informed the &s;urly Cerberus of this di&s;covery.</P>
<P>"That may be," replied the brute, in the mo&s;t indifferent accent: "I tell you, neverthele&s;s, my lord is not at home. So &s;aying, he turned his back on the confounded young man, pinching the ro&s;y cheek of a milk woman, who was pa&s;&s;ing by.</P>

<P>Pride was &s;ilent, and Ortenberg &s;ucceeded the next morning in obtaining admittance to the anti|chamber. There he found a gentleman decked with &s;ilk and gold, who &s;urveyed him from head to foot, and, at la&s;t, made half a bow, which was returned by our hero with a whole one.</P>

He hemmed, there|fore, with an air of open dignity, &s;pit in his &s;ilk pocket handkerchief, played with his watch chain, and looked at a &s;parkling ring of pa&s;te, which he wore on his finger. In this judicious po&s;ture he

<P>So! So!</P>

<P>The frequent repetition of ortenberg's indif|ferent <HI>So!</HI> di&s;countenanced the pre&s;ident's favour|ite, at la&s;t, entirely. He had never met with a &s;imilar reception. To &s;ee a propo&s;al, which, in his opinion, ought to be accepted with rapturous gratitude, rejected with the mo&s;t in&s;upportable indifference, was more than the philo&s;ophy of a valet could bear. However, the wretch was too much of a courtier, not to be able to conceal his vexation. He was, indeed, extremely di&s;tre&s;&s;ed about a provi&s;ion for his old aunt, and re&s;olved, therefore, to try once more what could be done. Being apprehen&s;ive the di&s;cour&s;e would &s;tagnate entirely, if he &s;uffered the &s;tranger to recover, from the high opinion of his con&s;equence with which he thought he had in&s;pired him, he re&s;u|med it &s;o quickly, that he even did not know what he was going to &s;ay:</P>

"I have al&s;o&mdash;I could al&s;o&mdash;I am a&mdash;" <HI>A Knave!</HI> cried a parrot in a di&s;tant corner of the room, whom Ortenberg had not yet noticed. <HI>A Knave!</HI> repeated the parrot di&s;tinctly, and Or|tenberg laughed. The face of the valet was covered with a &s;carlet hue; he ca&s;t a furious look at the innocent bird, and attempted in vain to make the honey of his eloquence flow again.</P>
<P>"Never mind, my good fellow!" &s;aid Orten|berg, rather contemptuou&s;ly; "don't let us kill time with u&s;ele&s;s talk. Tell your ma&s;ter that I wi&s;h to wait upon him."</P>
<P>Heavens, how did the provoked dunce <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;s up his head! The familiar epithet. My good <HI>fellow,</HI> from the lips of &s;uch a poor beggarly petitioner as Ortenberg appeared to be, to a per&s;onage who was valet to the pre&s;ident of Sturzenburzel, who had to di&s;po&s;e of the be&s;t livings in the country&mdash;indeed, that was too much.&mdash;He gna&s;hed his teeth, and replied with quivering lips, "My lord cannot give audience to <HI>beggars</HI> to day. You mu&s;t come again &s;ome other time." Or|tenberg &s;miled, and left the conceited up&s;tart.</P>

<P>With the&s;e words love turned to pride, care&s;|&s;ing him, and pre&s;enting two pictures which &s;he had ha&s;tily drawn. One repre&s;ented the helple&s;s Ortenberg, and the unprotected Caroline; and the other Ortenberg in Caroline's arms. Unfeeling pride glanced &s;everal times at them, and began to doze a little.</P>
<P>Ortenberg appeared the next morning again in the pre&s;ident's anti-chamber. His Excellency was one of tho&s;e people, who, having experienced no want them&s;elves, are not capable of forming an idea of the mi&s;ery of their brethren, and there|fore &s;in, not out of malice, but from unpardon|able weakne&s;s and unfeelingne&s;s, which render their &s;tate &s;o comfortable, that they carefully avoid every opportunity by which it could be di&s;turbed.</P>
<P>His anti-chamber was every day crowded with half-fami&s;hed &s;keletons, who, every morning with fa&s;ting &s;tomachs, &s;aw the fragrant breakfa&s;t of their patron carrying through the apartment in which
<PB N="116" REF="037761_0115_100ED4D1CE9AD888">
they were u&s;ed to dance attendance. They were indefatigable in paying their humble re&s;pects to the voluptuous arbiter of their fate; but &s;carcely were honoured with a kind nod of the head du|ring a life-long twelve-month, &s;pent in u&s;ele&s;s ap|plications, and many of them were urged by gnawing hunger to &s;teal the parrot's almonds. If his Excellency's belly was wanted to a&s;&s;i&s;t at &s;ome public breakfa&s;t, he &s;neaked away through a back gate, flinging him&s;elf into his gilt chariot, and withdrew from the hollow eyes of his wretch|ed clients. His parrot &s;oon learned to pronounce the words <HI>Oh God!</HI> very di&s;tinctly. Whole mountains of du&s;ty petitions, who&s;e authors had died of hunger long &s;ince, lay towered up in his &s;tudy, as he called the apartment in which he &s;igned his name <HI>once</HI> in a month. <HI>A sumptuous treat</HI> was, be&s;ides the powerful recommendation of his valet, the only infallible means of obtaining his con&s;et to a petition. The poor endeavoured to move his heart, and the rich tickled his palate; the poor mi&s;&s;ed their aim, and the rich always car|ried their object.</P>
<P>Our hero certainly could not have obtained acce&s;s to his &s;itting room, neither on that nor any other day, if accident had not befriended him. The air was extremely &s;ultry, the rays of the &s;un had relea&s;ed millions of in&s;ects from their temporary pri&s;ons, and an immen&s;e number of flies had taken po&s;t on a cold veni&s;on pa&s;ty, upon which the Baron intended to breakfa&s;t. His Ex|cellency was, indeed, not remi&s;s in endeavour|ing to repel the ho&s;tile army, but his fle&s;hy arm was &s;oon tired, and the flies returned always in great numbers; he rung, therefore, the bell, and ordered his people to be &s;ummoned to attack the bold intruders with united forces. The fol|lowing allies appeared without delay: John, the
<PB N="117" REF="037761_0116_100F055DC0B9A370">
hunt&s;man, with a net, which originally was de|&s;igned to catch larks; William, his running foot|man, with a napkin tied to a pole; Robert, the cook, with his kitchen apron fa&s;tened to a &s;kim|mer; and Samuel, the coachman, with a broom|&s;tick, which was armed with a hor&s;e tail. The commanding general addre&s;&s;ed his faithful allies in the following pathetic manner: Tho&s;e d***d flies inve&s;t every mor&s;el I am going to eat. Knock every one of them down, and let not one e&s;cape, that could give me further di&s;turbance!"</P>
<P>After this energetic addre&s;s had been deliver|ed, all windows and doors were thrown open, and a general cha&s;e began; when the routed ene|my &s;uddenly retreated through the windows. A large column took their flight through the anti|chamber, and a&s;&s;ailed Ortenberg, who in&s;tantly took out his pocket handkerchief, and attacked them with &s;o much ardour, that large drops of &s;weat ran down his face.</P>
<P>His Excellency, who was &s;itting oppo&s;ite the door, conde&s;cended graciou&s;ly to ob&s;erve, that a hungry client a&s;&s;i&s;ted voluntarily in putting his enemies to flight. The great man was &s;eized with a &s;udden fit of laughter, which was &s;o un|commonly beneficial to his noble &s;tomach, as to make his appetite return with additional energy. The plea&s;ure which this afforded to the worthy pre&s;ident, prompted his Excellency to make a gracious &s;ign to Ortenberg with his left hand to draw nearer. Our hero obeyed the kind invita|tion in&s;tantly, after an humble bow.</P>

He knows, for in&s;tance, to pre&s;erve fruit&mdash; <STAGE>(His Excellency &s;carcely could keep his eyes open)</STAGE>&mdash;and can drink&mdash;drink&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<P>Here the great man &s;uddenly extended his arms and legs, while the thoughtful head &s;ank upon the left &s;houlder. He muttered a few more bro|ken accents, and &s;oon &s;ignified by a loud &s;noring that the audience was at an end, and Ortenberg had no hopes left.</P>
<P>Our hero now proceeded to the hou&s;e of the Right Reverend Father in God Hog&s;tyerius, well knowing that he was the leading man in the con|&s;i&s;tory, and frequently had &s;ilenced the pre&s;ident by his &s;onorious voice. He &s;till knew not whe|ther he &s;hould laugh or grieve at the &s;ingular manner in which he had been received by the pre&s;ident. But when he reflected upon the broom|&s;tick with the hor&s;e tail, the veni&s;on pa&s;ty, and the cha&s;e of the flies, he was &s;uddenly &s;eized with a loud fit of laughing in the open &s;treet. This happened, unfortunately, ju&s;t when he was within a few &s;teps of the prelate's hou&s;e, who was &s;moking a pipe of cana&s;ter at the window, de|cently blowing the &s;moke into the &s;treet. It was a &s;hocking &s;ight for his Saint&s;hip to &s;ee Orten|berg, that great &s;inner, laugh in the &s;treet. He held the &s;ub&s;equent philo&s;ophical &s;oliloquy while Ortenberg a&s;cended the &s;tairs:</P>
<P>"That fellow has laughed."</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="037761_0119_100F056497857818">
"Either with or without cau&s;e."</P>
<P>"In the latter ca&s;e, he is a downright fool."</P>
<P>"Should the former be the ca&s;e, he either has laughed at me, or at &s;ome other object."</P>
<P>"If he has laughed at me, he will be damned for ever and ever!"</P>
<P>"But &s;hould he have laughed at &s;ome other ob|ject, I cannot conceive how the con&s;cience of &s;uch an atrocious &s;inner can permit him to laugh."</P>
<P>The re&s;ult of the whole &s;oliloquy was, there|fore, as my reader will ea&s;ily gue&s;s:</P>
<P>"Ortenberg is a &s;inner."</P>
<P>"He can laugh, and, con&s;equently, is not even &s;en&s;ible of his being a &s;inner."</P>
<P>"A hardened &s;inner will be doomed to howl and to gna&s;h his teeth."</P>
<P>"Ergo, Ortenberg mu&s;t howl and gna&s;h his teeth."</P>
<P>The charitable prelate rejoiced inwardly at his philo&s;ophical genius when he had brought forth his excellent conclu&s;ion. He contracted his bri&s;t|ly eye-brows when Ortenberg opened the door of his apartment, and called to him with a thun|dering voice,</P>
<P>"Mr. Ortenberg, what do you want? If you are coming to me for comfort or a&s;&s;i&s;tance, you will find neither.

He groaned, di&s;engaged him&s;elf from her arms, cla&s;ped her again to his heart, wept, tore him&s;elf once more from her, and fled to his &s;olitary a|bode.</P>
<P>I &s;carcely need to ob&s;erve to the &s;en&s;ible reader that I have written down only the words of this affecting &s;cene, and not the feelings which agita|ted the minds of the unfortunate lovers.

<P>Ortenberg's agonies were no longer boi&s;terous; he re&s;embled a per&s;on who, having &s;truggled a long time again&s;t the overwhelming billows, at la&s;t drops his arms, exhau&s;ted by the &s;everity of the conflict, and commits him&s;elf to the mercy of the waves. He did every thing which he under|took, with a kind of uncon&s;cious &s;tupor. The firm re&s;olution to quit his native country as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, was, however, con&s;tantly pre&s;ent to his mind. He &s;old all his remaining property at half price, and paid his trifling debts. After having &s;atisfied all his creditors, his whole wealth was reduced to a coat, a few &s;hirts, and &s;ix &s;hil|lings in money. "Be firm, my poor heart!" &s;aid the unfortunate young man when he approached the frontiers of his native country, &s;upported by an oaken &s;taff, and ca&s;ting a la&s;t tearful look at the town of his nativity: "Be firm, my poor heart! I &s;hall not be left without bread. God will let &s;ome grow for me too. I &s;hall not al|ways meet with hypocri&s;y and ignorance di&s;gui&s;|ed under the ma&s;k of religion.

After a journey of &s;ome days, when his &s;ix &s;hillings were already &s;pent, and he knew not where to get a mor&s;el of bread for to-morrow, he arrived in the beginning of a &s;erene day at the gates of H**, a &s;mall Pru&s;&s;ian town.

<P>Ortenberg had &s;eated him&s;elf on a large &s;tone. He took his breakfa&s;t out of his pocket, while he was &s;inging, &s;harpened his knife, and took his frugal meal on the verdant turf. A pure and &s;a|lubrious air &s;ea&s;oned his bread, and a choir of nightingales threw a thin veil over the pictures of his grief.</P>
<P>An hone&s;t citizen of K** who was weeding his field, had li&s;tened to Ortenberg's &s;ong behind a hazel bu&s;h, and was deeply affected by his me|lancholy

notes. His emotion increa&s;ed when he &s;aw Ortenberg breakfa&s;t with cheerful &s;atisfaction upon a piece of black bread, and a few dried prunes. He al&s;o took notice of the gloom which overclouded the traveller's countenance, although his hilarity of mind, that &s;weet fruit of a good con&s;cience, brightened it with lucid rays. The poverty of his dre&s;s contributed to increa&s;e the intere&s;t which his per&s;on and behaviour created. The citizen could not re&s;i&s;t his urgent de&s;ire to acco&s;t the pious pilgrim. He took his hat off, and &s;tept forth from his hiding place with confi|dence&mdash;in&s;piring looks.</P>

<P>The &s;imple cordiality with which the hone&s;t fellow made his offer, touched Ortenberg's heart. "With plea&s;ure!" replied he with a cheerful countenance, and took up his little bundle. The citizen had, in the mean time, tied his &s;allad in a handkerchief.</P>

<P>Don't trouble your&s;elf. I now am eighty-five years old; but God be prai&s;ed! I know nothing either of bodily or mental infirmities. I creep quietly through life, and God has given his ble&s;&s;ing to my undertakings, I have cultivated that

<P>Whenever I knock at the door of my hou&s;e, I imagine that it will be opened by my Mary, and I fill a plate mechanically for her when the &s;oup is brought upon the table: when I undre&s;s my&s;elf at night, I always expect that &s;he will reach me my night-gown, but, alas! mu&s;t fetch it my|&s;elf; and when &s;ecret grief preys on my heart, I know not what to do with it. Alas! I always wi&s;h to be with her in the bli&s;sful abode of peace when|ever I come from church on a Sunday, and ca&s;t my eyes at the &s;pot where &s;he is buried, which now is entirely overgrown with gra&s;s.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Citizen.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; dear Sir! God has not granted me that happine&s;s. Perhaps it is better as it is. However, I have a mother who is an hundred years old.&mdash;Who would nur&s;e and wait upon her

<P>Much le&s;s would have been &s;ufficient to intere&s;t Ortenberg's good and feeling heart in favour of that good old man. He &s;eized his hand with great emotion. "Venerable old man? I rejoice to have met with an hone&s;t and feeling heart; alas! there are but very few in this world."</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Citizen.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard you &s;ing a very pretty hymn. We hope for better joys than this world can afford. This is the only comfort of oppre&s;&s;ed virtue. I do not doubt but you are one of that cla&s;s.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ortenberg.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am poor; I am not a&s;hamed of it. However, while I can work, I will rob no per&s;on who can work no more, of the charitable a&s;&s;i&s;tance of good men.</P>

<P>The&s;e are noble principles. Give me your hand! <STAGE>(He &s;hakes it cordially.)</STAGE> We mu&s;t get better acquainted. But tell me frankly, can

I do any thing for you? Have you any bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;ettle at H**? My fellow-citizens love me, and will be glad to do me a favour.</P>
</SP>
<P>Ju&s;t &s;uch a frank and cordial language was re|quired to prevail upon Ortenberg to confe&s;s that he wi&s;hed to open a day-&s;chool at H**. The old man promi&s;ed to exert all his influence to recom|mend it among his numerous acquaintances, and they arrived at la&s;t at his &s;mall peaceful a|bode. "Be cordially welcome under my roof," &s;aid the Citizen; "and take up with the humble fare which my hou&s;e can afford."</P>
<P>The old mother met them at the door of the parlour, &s;upported by a crutch, and nodded kindly to the &s;tranger. Her &s;on tapped her gently on the &s;houlder:</P>
<P>"I have brought you a gue&s;t, dear mother. His name is&mdash;Dear, &s;ir, what is your name? I really forgot to inquire after it."</P>
<P>Ortenberg mentioned his name.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Citizen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well! well! the name is of no con&s;e|quence. God regards the heart. People who have the greate&s;t names, are frequently the great|e&s;t knaves.&mdash;Mother, let us have &s;omething to eat; my gue&s;t is hungry.</P>
</SP>
<P>The cloth was in&s;tantly laid, and three good people dined cheerfully together! Three good people at one table! you will not find them at the tables of the great.</P>
<P>The plan concerning Ortenberg's &s;chool was di&s;cu&s;&s;ed again after dinner. The citizen pre&s;&s;ed Ortenberg to accept of free board and lodging in his hou&s;e; but could not per&s;uade him to con&s;ent. Ortenberg was determined to owe every frugal mor&s;el which he &s;hould eat to no one but him&s;elf. Labour for our &s;upport creates and &s;atisfies hunger. Tho&s;e idle drones, who are fattened with the marrow and &s;weat of the poor, cannot enjoy their
<PB N="130" REF="037761_0129_100F0578F5FEC8D0">
wealth. Thus &s;poke and thought that exiled young man, who was not worth a groat, and would not have <HI>thought</HI> otherwi&s;e, though he would have <HI>spoken</HI> differently, if he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed millions.</P>
<P>The old man exerted his good-natured eloquence in vain, and it was to no purpo&s;e when he begged him to con&s;ider that neither him&s;elf nor his aged mother would be able to &s;pend the little with which God had ble&s;&s;ed him.</P>
<P>"Be my &s;on!" exclaimed he with paternal af|fection: "I have no children whom you could rob."</P>
<P>Ortenberg never &s;uffered his heart to get the better of his principles. He was deeply affected, but per&s;i&s;ted, neverthele&s;s, firmly in his re&s;o|lution.</P>
<P>"It will afford me plea&s;ure," &s;aid he, "to ho|nour you as a father; for alas! I neither have a father nor a mother! but I &s;hould be unde&s;erving your paternal love, if I &s;hamefully could abu&s;e your good nature. It may be pride, which, in|deed, is a &s;teril &s;oil; however a noble exertion of all my abilities is the fruit which it produces. In &s;hort, I never will accept a charitable gift of any per&s;on whom&s;oever. I will never beg for any thing. I would exchange my heart with no per|&s;on whatever. Of whom could I beg without le&s;|&s;ening the value of this heart? I hate hypocri&s;y&mdash;a hypocrite is a knave!"</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Citizen.</SPEAKER>
<P>But many an hone&s;t man is reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of begging; and there are in|&s;tances&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ortenberg.</SPEAKER>
<P>True my venerable friend, there are in&s;tances in which begging is the &s;weete&s;t triumph of humanity. If I cannot &s;ave my de&s;erted friend from mi&s;ery, by my own exertions, I &s;hall beg for him, and be proud of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Citizen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Ortenberg, I will pre&s;s you no
<PB N="131" REF="037761_0130_100F057B953C7A48">
further; the will of man is his heaven. All that you have &s;aid, is, indeed, very pretty, and I ap|plaud you for it; however, it appears to me, not to be quite con&s;onant with truth. But I am a &s;imple man, and cannot pre&s;ume to di&s;pute with you.</P>
</SP>
<P>Thus terminated the noble conte&s;t between be|nevolent genero&s;ity and the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the dignity of man.</P>
<P>The following was the re&s;ult of their con&s;ul|tation:</P>
<P>Ortenberg took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a garret in the hou&s;e of the hone&s;t Citizen, which was &s;cantily furni&s;hed, and for which he agreed to pay a mode|rate rent. He dined at the table of his fo&s;ter|father, and in lieu of payment, in&s;tructed two or|phan god&s;ons of his ho&s;t in religion, writing and reading. Supper, as well as all &s;uperfluous be|verage with which Mocca, China, and the two Indias furni&s;h us, were entirely bani&s;hed from the table of our hero. "I will prove," &s;aid he by him&s;elf, "how little man wants, if he <HI>will</HI> want little."</P>
<P>The old man promi&s;ed to &s;peak in the evening with &s;ome of his friends, and to per&s;uade the olde&s;t and mo&s;t re&s;pectable Citizens to intru&s;t him with the education and in&s;truction of their children. He was as good as his word. Ortenberg &s;aw him|&s;elf in le&s;s than eight days, daily &s;urrounded by five or &s;ix boys, who&s;e education procured him, indeed, only a &s;canty &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, but enabled him, at the &s;ame time, to gratify his prevailing pa&s;&s;ion, pride, and to owe every mor&s;el which he ate en|tirely to his diligence; for the hone&s;t Citizen ap|plied in vain artifice and per&s;ua&s;ion to render his &s;ituation more comfortable.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>READER, I &s;hall attempt to give a faithful de&s;cription of Ortenberg's external and internal &s;ituation. He lived in a &s;mall low garret, with a kitchen adjoining, which, however, was never blackened with &s;moke, while it was in Ortenberg's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The condition of his apartment was the mo&s;t &s;peaking proof of his poverty. Four &s;traw chairs, two tables, and a wooden bench for his &s;cholars, a piece of a broken looking gla&s;s, and a &s;orry turn-up bed, was all his furniture. A dark window with round panes &s;et in lead, half covered with paper, afforded a pro&s;pect of part of a ruined wall, the re&s;idence of &s;hrieking owls, who&s;e melancholy&punc; voices frightened &s;leep, his on|ly remaining &s;olace, from his &s;olitary couch. The wall which was the remnant of a powder maga|zine, deprived him pretty much of the cheering light of day; and the gloom which prevailed in his apartment was heightened in no &s;mall degree by the browni&s;h colour of the walls. The decay|ed roof was frequently a &s;port of the winds; rain and &s;now defied this crazy &s;hield, and poured damps and unwhole&s;ome air into his apartment. Narrow and dark &s;tairs &s;eemed to bear his foot &s;teps with indignation, groaning and bending under their weight. The whole room was con|&s;tantly filled with the unplea&s;ant &s;mell ari&s;ing from the work of a tanner, who&s;e yard was under his window. Who of my readers is not &s;en&s;ible that a cheeful abode is the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary requi&s;ite to render a di&s;mal &s;ate tolerable, and that an unfortu|nate
<PB N="134" REF="037761_0133_100F05815323CF90">
&s;ufferer mu&s;t be rendered entirely unhappy, in &s;uch a gloomy pri&s;on! Ortenberg's mind &s;hrouded it&s;elf timidly in a gloomy, impenitrable mi&s;t.</P>
<P>He was &s;urrounded from the dawn of morning till the du&s;k of the eve covered nature with its &s;able mantle, by a &s;mall flock of children, whom he in&s;tructed in &s;ubjects which afforded only a me|chanical occupation to his mind. The only poor reward which he enjoyed from the labours of the day was confined to a &s;olitary walk which tended more to nouri&s;h his melancholy mood, than to di&s;pel the gloom of his mind. The produce of his &s;chool was &s;carcely &s;ufficient to defray the &s;mall expences of his frugal table, and his &s;imple dre&s;s.</P>
<P>He had no acquaintance be&s;ides his landlord, to whom he never complained. His wounds bled ince&s;&s;antly; however, he rejected the healing bal|&s;am which nature di&s;tills from confidential com|munication. The town contained two men of letters, as they were plea&s;ed to call them&s;elves, a corpulent magi&s;trate, and a &s;till more corpulent prie&s;t. The former was an abject &s;lave to his belly, and the latter was no acquaintance that &s;uit|ed Ortenberg; for he &s;hunned all prie&s;ts like &s;er|pents &s;ince his departure from Bre&s;law. There was no food for the mind to be procured at H**. Bibles and hymn books compri&s;ed all the litera|ture which the place afforded, &s;ome volumes of Sermons excepted, which the corpulent pre&s;t po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed, and by all the inhabitants were regarded as a library. However, even if the barbarous town had been inundated with book&s;ellers &s;hops and cir|culating libraries, yet Ortenberg's &s;canty revenues would have prevented him totally from all acce&s;s to the&s;e magazines of learning. His mind lan|gui&s;hed therefore in the pri&s;on of inactivity, and he was incapable of allaying his unhappine&s;s by
<PB N="135" REF="037761_0134_100F0582D84326B0">
improvement in knowledge, labour, and &s;tudy, which alone can &s;ometimes di&s;pel the gloom of mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>His rea&s;on had dictated to his heart the cruel law to beat no longer for Caroline. He thought it would be criminal in him, were he to write to her, as this might ea&s;ily contribute to nouri&s;h her hope and pa&s;&s;ion. It was no ea&s;y ta&s;k for him to deny him&s;elf that plea&s;ure: however, he collected all his firmne&s;s to oppo&s;e the imperious dictates of his heart, and renounce with heroic fortitude, the &s;weet plea&s;ure of an intimate corre&s;pondence.</P>
<P>Then the poor, unfortunate &s;ufferer had no en|joyment left?&mdash;Yes! he &s;till had a few cheerful moments; namely, tho&s;e which the kind letters of his Elhenhor&s;t procured him. The expences of po&s;tage di&s;tre&s;&s;ed him, indeed, frequently very much; however, he rather would deny him&s;elf &s;ome nece&s;&s;aries of life, than forego the enjoy|ment of the plea&s;ing con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that he po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed a faithful and &s;incere friend, who&s;e heart de|fied time and di&s;tance. My readers know that Elhenhor&s;t could have no idea of Ortenberg's la|mentable &s;ituation, and imagined it was entirely different from what it really was; becau&s;e Orten|berg never complained.</P>
<P>As &s;ufferers who are de&s;erted by all men, mu&s;t have &s;ome object of their affection, Ortenberg had tamed two pigeons, with whom he &s;hared his &s;orry fare, and who afforded him many &s;weet mo|ments by their innocent attachment to him. He became every day fonder of his brute compani|ons; they ate out of his hands and mouth; their cooing was his lullaby; their care&s;&s;es turned his gloomy angui&s;h frequently to &s;oft melancholy, and he would not have exchanged the mor&s;el of bread which he &s;hared with his pigeons, for the groaning table of the magi&s;trate.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="037761_0135_100F05854A275998">
He had now langui&s;hed &s;even leaden months in this melancholy &s;ituation. It grew more di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing every day; the gloom of his mind in|crea&s;ed vi&s;ibly, his &s;trength dwindled away, and he hoped his &s;ufferings would &s;oon be termina|ted by the all healing hand of death. Not one de&s;ire, not a &s;ingle expectation remained in his bo&s;om. Death! death alone was the object of his wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>He was &s;itting one evening, by the faint glim|mering of a lamp, &s;upporting his head upon his hand, and contemplating a fly who had burned her wings in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lame.&mdash;Conceive, reader, if you can, conceive the rapturous joy which like elec|tric fire thrilled his whole frame, when the door was &s;uddenly flung open and Elhenhor&s;t &s;tood before him. His travelling coat was ornamented with a &s;parkling &s;tar; for his merits had &s;oon rai&s;|ed him in a country where merit, at that time, was the only recommendation. But this very &s;tar, made Ortenberg &s;tart back, when he already had expanded his arms to pre&s;s his long lo&s;t friend to his &s;uffering heart. However, the mini&s;ter flew towards him with marks of the mo&s;t heart|felt joy.</P>
<P>"Ortenberg! Ortenberg! have I become a &s;tranger to your heart? Have you cea&s;ed to be my friend?</P>
<P>They flew into each other's arms&mdash;their eyes were fixed on each other. Once more embrace. Their looks were dimmed; for their eyes &s;wam in &s;weet tears. A third embrace. No words in|terrupted the meeting of their hearts&mdash;nor &s;hall I attempt to de&s;cribe by words the rapture of a &s;cene which only can be felt.</P>

<P>The death of my mother&mdash;the un|happy fate of my Caroline.</P>
</SP>
<P>He never could pronounce Caroline's name, without being deeply affected. The &s;ight of El|henhor&s;t recalled to his mind all the happy even|ings when his friend had kindly a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in building airy ca&s;tles; when the whole world yet lay open before him, and he knew malice, envy, and chicanery, only from hear-&s;ay. This &s;weet|recollection, which, added to the bitterne&s;s of his pre&s;ent &s;ituation, mellowed him &s;uddenly, and he began to unbo&s;om him&s;elf to his friend. How|ever, my readers already know his lofty mind&mdash;he &s;eemed to have entirely forgotten his own di&s;|tre&s;s, and mentioned not a &s;yllable of it to a man who was his &s;incere&s;t friend, and had it in his power to extricate him at once, from all his diffi|culties. He related only the &s;ufferings which the mi&s;ery of others cau&s;ed him, and &s;eemed to be perfectly &s;atisfied with his own &s;ituation.</P>
<P>However, although his lips uttered no com|plaints, yet his hollow eyes, his meagre appear|ance, his half torn garment, and his &s;orry apart|ment, be&s;poke his di&s;tre&s;s plainly enough. El|henhor&s;t &s;urveyed his friend's apartment with tearful eyes, and his bleeding heart vowed &s;ecret|ly to a&s;&s;i&s;t the unfortunate man. Ortenberg was
<PB N="138" REF="037761_0137_100F058A298CBFD0">
thrown into the greate&s;t confu&s;ion, when he percei|ved that Elhenhor&s;t &s;urveyed every corner of his room. He ha&s;tened to draw his friend into a conver&s;ation, and to turn his attention to &s;ome other object.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ortenberg.</SPEAKER>
<P>May a di&s;creet friend a&s;k what is the object of your journey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elhenhorst.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is no &s;ecret. You know what a heavy burden lay on my &s;houlders; I mention|ed it &s;everal times in my letters to you. I was &s;carcely able to endure it any longer, and was &s;eized with a melancholy gloom of mind, I al|mo&s;t &s;hould &s;ay, with dark mi&s;anthropy. I was nece&s;&s;iated to &s;pend the greate&s;t part of the day among&s;t tire&s;ome dead, among&s;t whom Ju&s;tini|anus certainly was the mo&s;t tedious, which cau&s;|ed me mechanically to fly the living. My &s;upe|riors took notice of my gloomy exi&s;tence when I lea&s;t expected it; they &s;eemed to be convinced that the camel, which always mu&s;t travel with the caravan to Mecca, without being ever relea&s;ed, becomes lame at la&s;t. The king informed me unexpectedly by a letter, in his own hand-wri|ting, that he had appointed me to be mini&s;ter plenipotentiary at **, and that I am to repair thi|ther within three months. I am now going to Berlin, to thank the king, and to obtain my in|&s;tructions.</P>

I know you. I &s;hall not dwell on the contempt which, unfortunately, is attached to your pre&s;ent occupation. An hone&s;t man is &s;ati&s;|fied with the approbation of his own con&s;cience, and frets not when fools overlook his merits. But I know that Caroline is the &s;ole object of all your wi&s;hes. The worthy Ortenberg cannot de|&s;ire that the darling of his heart, who would willingly &s;hare a &s;canty income with him, &s;hould renounce, on his account, all comforts of life, honour and many other advantages which a crowd of adorers would offer her, if &s;he were not con|nected with him.</P>

<P><STAGE>(brightening &s;uddenly up).</STAGE> It will give me the greate&s;t plea&s;ure.</P>
</SP>
<P>My readers will be convinced that this, "It will give me the greate&s;t plea&s;ure!" came from the bottom of his heart. However, you al&s;o know Ortenberg's indifferent circum&s;tances. Although he could not be expected to give an alderman's fea&s;t; yet a &s;upper required that &s;omething &s;hould
<PB N="141" REF="037761_0140_100F058FA17DDA40">
be brought upon table. Unfeeling metal! thou main-&s;pring which moves the &s;till more unfeel|ing world! the unfortunate mu&s;t &s;tarve if he can|not obtain thee while his rich neighbour is choak|ed by wanton &s;uperfluity. No grey headed mi|&s;er throws a dry cru&s;t of bread which he can chew no more him&s;elf to the fami&s;hed poor.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e of my readers, who have formed a ju&s;t idea of Ortenberg's noble and generous charac|ter, will ea&s;ily conceive that this came not in his mind, when he ra&s;hly a&s;&s;ured his friend that his company at &s;upper would give him the greate&s;t plea&s;ure. The &s;ight of a dear friend, with a &s;park|ling &s;tar on his brea&s;t, had made him for a time forget his wants. However, even when he recol|lected his poverty, he was not in the lea&s;t di&s;tre&s;|&s;ed by it. His good heart, overflowing with friend&s;hip, in&s;tantly pointed out the means of gra|tifying Elhenhor&s;t's reque&s;t and his own wi&s;h. Ortenberg killed his two pigeons.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive the angui&s;h which he felt when he took a knife from the dre&s;&s;er, and one of his darlings, apprehending no harm from her benefactor, fearle&s;sly &s;troked her bill again&s;t the fatal in&s;trument. His heart bled more than the dying pigeon, when he &s;aw her blood flow, &s;aw her convul&s;ive &s;truggles, and imagined he read in her breaking eye&mdash;What harm have I done you? A &s;tream of tears gu&s;hed from his eyes; he averted his face from the bleeding com|panions of his &s;olitary hours, went to the window and endeavoured to collect him&s;elf again, le&s;t El|henhor&s;t, on his joining him again, &s;hould have rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that he had &s;acrificed for him his la&s;t and only plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>His landlord's &s;ervant, a good natured creature, who was very much attached to Ortenberg, eja|culated a loud &s;cream, when he brought the two
<PB N="142" REF="037761_0141_100F059204332260">
bleeding pigeons into the kitchen, and de&s;ired her to dre&s;s them for &s;upper.</P>
<P>"For God's &s;ake, Mr. Ortenberg!" exclaimed the &s;ervant trembling: "what have you done?"</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ortenberg.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is the matter? why do you cry?</P>

<P>Your pigeons! your good, faithful pigeons! <STAGE>(She &s;obbed, and mingled her tears with the blood of the poor creatures.)</STAGE></P>
</SP>
<P>"Be not a fool!" &s;aid Ortenberg with &s;tifled emotion: "there are plenty of pigeons to be got."</P>
<P>He left the kitchen, a&s;cending again to the gar|ret. There he &s;at down, cheerfully &s;miling, by the &s;ide of his friend, enjoying the happine&s;s of congenial communication, and forgot his pigeons. Elhenhor&s;t related every trifling incident which had happened to him during their &s;eparation. Or|tenberg returned his communication with equal &s;incerity, repre&s;enting, however, the heavy blows of his adver&s;e fate in a humourous light, and &s;triving anxiou&s;ly to pourtray his misfortunes in comical colours. He &s;aid, for in&s;tance, only a few words about his fruitle&s;s application for the promi&s;ed living, but dwelled the longer on the cha&s;e of the flies and on the de&s;cription of Mi&s;s Shnurr.</P>
<P>The &s;ervant now appeared with the roa&s;ted fa|vourites. Her red eyes &s;carcely could retain a new torrent of tears which was ready to break forth. Elhenhor&s;t perceived it not, and Orten|berg <HI>pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">tended</HI> not to &s;ee it. He was proud of being able to treat his friend with a &s;upper, and the few hours which Elhenhor&s;t could devote to him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ed on wings of heart felt plea&s;ure, a &s;en&s;a|tion to which he had grown almo&s;t an utter &s;tran|ger.

</SP>
<P>Elhenhor&s;t's heart bled.</P>
<P>"but why did he kill them?" a&s;ked he in a trembling accent.</P>
<P>"Becau&s;e the poor man had nothing el&s;e," re|plied the &s;ervant: "He ab&s;olutely refu&s;es to ac|cept of any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from my ma&s;ter.

When he had travelled &s;ome miles, and pro|found darkne&s;s already covered the face of the globe, he perceived that the po&s;tillion drove over f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">elds and ditches.

<P>The matter? Why, the devil has made me mi&s;s the road. They have burnt a witch her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> a hundred years &s;ince, and her cur&s;ed &s;pirit haunts the&s;e parts.</P>
</SP>
<P>Elhenhor&s;t was vexed.</P>
<P>"Mu&s;t I lo&s;e my way ju&s;t now!" exclaimed he; "now while I wi&s;h to fly on wings of friend|&s;hip to have the fir&s;t ray of the dawning morn for a cheerful witne&s;s of a bli&s;sful meeting?"</P>
<P>The po&s;tillion drove onwards as well as he could, the wheels contended with the field-&s;tones, the &s;parks flew from the gravel, the hor&s;es got into a mora&s;s, and the chai&s;e was overturned. El|henhor&s;t received no injury but a bleeding no&s;e, and having his great coat covered with mud. He ordered his people to a&s;&s;i&s;t the po&s;tillion in di&s;en|gaging the chai&s;e from the mud, took his pi&s;tols, wrapped him&s;elf in his cloak, and &s;at down upon a ri&s;ing ground.</P>
<P>Here I &s;hould have the be&s;t opportunity of in|troducing a &s;entimental di&s;cour&s;e between Elhen|hor&s;t and the moon, which ju&s;t emerged from a dark ma&s;s of clouds, and &s;ilvered their margin. Elhenhor&s;t thought this is the moon! but, as for the re&s;t, was &s;o unfeeling as to blow the &s;moke of his tobacco pipe in her face. The po&s;tillion was &s;till more unfeeling; for he was &s;o impudent as to exclaim: "If that cur&s;ed moon had come &s;ooner, I &s;hould not have lo&s;t my way."</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="037761_0148_100F05A08AD4F6E8">
The moon cared not a pin for their want of feeling, and di&s;engaged her&s;elf entirely from the clouds which en&s;hrouded her orb, to be a witne&s;s of a &s;cene which at once gave a different turn to Elhenhor&s;t's ideas.</P>
<P>He was &s;itting on the turf, contemplating the &s;moke of his pipe, which the nocturnal breeze di&s;pelled, and thought, this is a picture of glory; and thus his ideas &s;oon reverted again to his un|fortunate friend. He was ju&s;t going to anticipate the heavenly &s;cene, when he &s;hould &s;urpri&s;e Or|tenberg with the plea&s;ing intelligence which his letter-ca&s;e contained, when &s;uddenly piercing &s;creams from an adjacent thicket &s;truck his ear. He mechanically laid hold of his pi&s;tols on hear|ing the cry of di&s;tre&s;s. Elhenhor&s;t was naturally brave, and had a heart which could feel for the di&s;tre&s;s of others. The lamentations of an unfor|tunate wretch never failed to touch him to the quick; his arm and pur&s;e had felt it frequently. He &s;tarted up: "William, draw your hanger, and follow me!"</P>
<P>The po&s;tillion remon&s;trated, prote&s;ting that he &s;hould not be able to repair the damage which the carriage had received in le&s;s than two hours, if William did not a&s;&s;i&s;t him.</P>
<P>"William, follow me!" was the only an&s;wer which the Baron returned, and both went towards the &s;pot whence the &s;creams proceeded. It now changed into hollow groans, which &s;carcely were audible; however, the glimmer of a light in the thicket, &s;erved Elhenhor&s;t as a guide.</P>
<P>He arrived at the &s;pot and beheld&mdash;a young beautiful girl with a gag in her mouth, &s;truggling under the hands of three villains, who were go|ing to violate her. The la&s;t &s;trength of the girl &s;eemed to be exhau&s;ted. She had in vain torn the cheeks of her enemies with her nails, and
<PB N="150" REF="037761_0149_100F05A375A26C48">
at|tempted, to no purpo&s;e, to &s;eize with impatient fury the &s;word of the officer who &s;eemed to be the leader of the&s;e wretches. A cord was tied to her round white arms, her recollection left her, and the guardian angel of her innocence wept.</P>
<P>Virtue conquers but rarely; however, it is not always &s;ubdued.</P>
<P>"Stop!" exclaimed Elhenhor&s;t, with a loud voice, cocking his pi&s;tol. "Wretch, de&s;i&s;t, or you are a dead man!"</P>
<P>The officer turned round, &s;eized with confu|&s;ion, and drew his &s;word. His accomplices un|&s;heathed their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">abres, and a bloody conflict &s;eem|ed to be unavoidable.</P>
<P>The officer was going to ru&s;h upon Elhenhor&s;t, but &s;uddenly &s;topt &s;hort, when he beheld the cock|ed pi&s;tol in the &s;tranger's hands.</P>

The officer retired, and Elhenhor&s;t went up to the lady, who had fainted away.</P>
<P>Peace to the a&s;hes of the monk who invented gunpowder! Thou&s;ands maintain he has been a cur&s;e to mankind; but here is an in&s;tance of pre|&s;erved innocence which mu&s;t be brought to his account. Elhenhor&s;t's pi&s;tols alone were capable of preventing a bloody conte&s;t, the &s;ucce&s;s of which would have been very doubtful, on account of the &s;uperiority of the enemy. However, the murderous in&s;trument in Elhenhor&s;t's hand made him in that moment ab&s;olute ma&s;ter of the trem|bling wretches who &s;tood before him.</P>

</SP>
<P>His orders were punctually executed. The two wretches carried the lady away, and William was clo&s;e at their heels with his cutla&s;s. The officer was petrified, bit his nails, gna&s;hed his teeth, but was &s;en&s;ible of his impotence.</P>

<SPEAKER>Elhenhorst.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I am your humble &s;ervant. You will find me by inquiring for Baron Elhen|hor&s;t.</P>

<P>With the&s;e words he retired, and followed his prize. His tru&s;ty William had already reached the carriage, which the coachman and his other &s;ervants, in the mean time, had &s;ufficiently repair|ed. The &s;en&s;ele&s;s girl was put into it: her car|riers received &s;ome la&s;hes inflicted by the whip of the coachman, and retreated as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible

to the thicket, where their di&s;appointed ma&s;ter was venting his impotent fury on the innocent gra&s;s.</P>
<P>Elhenhor&s;t proceeded on his journey, reward|ed by the heavenly con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having per|formed a good action, and left the recovery of his fair companion to God and nature.</P>
<P>Morning dawned already, and Aurora's re|fre&s;hing breath animated &s;ilent nature with new life. The revigorating breezes of the morning air in&s;tilled new &s;trength into the exhau&s;ted frame of the fair &s;ufferer, and &s;he awoke from her &s;tu|por. Her &s;oft, blue eyes opened them&s;elves, and &s;parkled in the dawn of the coming day. Her cheeks put Aurora to the blu&s;h; the fir&s;t ray of Phoebus ki&s;&s;ed timidly her blooming lips; young zephyrs &s;ported with her auburn tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>"Where am I?" whi&s;pered &s;he &s;oftly, like the breeze of the morning air in the thin twigs of the beech-tree; like the trembling notes of a flute.</P>
<P>"In the hands of a gentleman," replied El|henhor&s;t: "be ea&s;y, dear lady, you are &s;afe."</P>
<P>This an&s;wer, Elhenhor&s;t's noble countenance and benevolent looks, di&s;pelled at once the gloom that hung on her eyes; &s;he &s;eemed to be going to &s;peak, her lips opened them&s;elves, and wanton cupids re&s;umed their places in the dimples of her cheeks. However, a new gloom &s;pread it|&s;elf &s;uddenly over her charming face, when her bloody fingers recalled the &s;cene of la&s;t night to her mind. Her heart was on the rack; her heav|ing bo&s;om panted for air, and the blooming ro&s;e turned to a pale lily.</P>
<P>"Am I &s;till as I was?" a&s;ked &s;he with pale and quivering lips, while &s;he ca&s;t down her eyes. The moment in which &s;he expected to hear El|henhor&s;t's

<P>Yes, you &s;till are what your eyes be&s;peak you, immaculate and undefiled. Ble&s;&s;ed be the hour in which the guardian angel of inno|cence made me your deliverer!</P>
</SP>
<P>Good God! exclaimed the girl, with folded hands, and rai&s;ing her eyes to heaven. Her lips moved &s;oftly; &s;he &s;eemed to pray. Elhenhor&s;t contemplated her in &s;ilence; that is to &s;ay, his lips were &s;ilent; however his heart &s;poke louder than it had done hitherto; panted more violent|ly than it ever had done before. A &s;wee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;trange &s;en&s;ation poured &s;uddenly a gentle, but devouring fire in his veins.

<P>The girl now turned to Elhenhor&s;t; Elhenhor&s;t trembled.</P>
<P>"My lord! to whom owes an unfortunate be|ing the pre&s;ervation of her innocence and life?"</P>
<P>Elhenhor&s;t trembled &s;till more violently. What a &s;ingular change! He had been u&s;ed to &s;mile with pity at the beauties of his native country, when they attempted to in&s;nare his heart by a thou&s;and female artifices; to face firmly every eye that expected to conquer him by its fire or langui&s;hing and tender looks. He took no notice of a white arm, or an ela&s;tic bo&s;om: and when he happened to ca&s;t a look at the charms of beauty, he contemplated them like a man who admires a fine picture. But how different were his &s;en&s;a|tions <HI>now!</HI> His bo&s;om was &s;traitened the fir&s;t time, and his eyes were afraid to meet tho&s;e of the fair &s;tranger.

<P>THE &s;tranger &s;carcely had pronounced the name Caroline Summer, when the colour fled from Elhenhor&s;t's glowing cheeks. He &s;tarted back and &s;queezed him&s;elf into the oppo&s;ite corner of the chai&s;e, no le&s;s firmly and anxiou&s;ly than if he had committed a &s;acrilege. His pale face grew longer, his eyes &s;tared, his mouth remained open, his foot trembled to touch the hem of her gown, every look of his, every word he had uttered, appeared cri|minal to him. Poor Elhenhor&s;t! by what crime had&s;t thou de&s;erved that love &s;hould maliciou&s;ly &s;teal into thy artle&s;s heart to &s;truggle with the pure&s;t friend&s;hip.</P>

He re&s;embled a dreaming per&s;on in the fir&s;t moments which &s;ucceeded that fatal di&s;covery; for, a ri&s;ing pa&s;&s;ion is a &s;weet dream which deludes our mind with plea&s;ant and new &s;en&s;ations, and makes us anticipate the gratification of our wi&s;hes in the very moment of which they were begotten. Imagine that &s;uch a charming vi&s;ionary dream were cha&s;ed from your mind by a &s;udden alarm of fire, and you will have an idea of Elhenhor&s;t's feelings in the fir&s;t moments when he learned who the enchanting &s;tranger was. The emotions by which they were &s;ucceeded, were like the trem|bling of a wanderer, who, in the darkne&s;s of night, &s;uddenly perceives by a fla&s;h of lightning, that he &s;lept at the brink of a precipice. But he had &s;carcely conceived the idea, <HI>This girl is the mis|tress of my friend!</HI> when he ordered the po&s;tilion to &s;top, and &s;ilently quitted the carriage without being able to account for that involuntary action.</P>
<P>"What a &s;ingular man!" &s;aid Caroline by her|&s;elf: &s;hall I rejoice at my pre&s;ervation, or appre|hend to have fallen from the talons of a vulture, into the fangs of a tyger? But no, no, it cannot be; the Creator writes an illegible hand, and na|ture is an impudent comedian, if this man be a villain!"</P>
<P>Who could blame Caroline for her apprehen|&s;ions and doubts? Elhenhor&s;t's conduct was &s;o &s;in|gular, that confidence it&s;elf would have read the brooding over a black deed in the di&s;ordered countenance of this unknown. Caroline wi&s;hed to enquire of the po&s;tilion or the valet, after the name of her pre&s;erver; however Elhenhor&s;t's pre|&s;ence clo&s;ed her lips. The carriage drove &s;lowly, and he walked by its &s;ide; he &s;truggled and was conquered; he &s;truggled again and obtained the victory.</P>

A long pau&s;e. The &s;ouls of both travellers fea&s;ted upon the raptures of overflowing &s;en&s;a|tions of happine&s;s, but were, neverthele&s;s, not totally unclouded.

<P>She now began with a charming &s;implicity to relate her fate. My readers know adready that the per&s;ecuted girl &s;ought and &s;ound an a&s;ylum in the hou&s;e of Lady Anna Maria of Xantippendale.</P>
<P>"I do not deny," continued Caroline, "that her hou&s;e did not entirely an&s;wer my wi&s;hes and expectations. I imagined to have met with a good and venerable matron, who&s;e only weakne&s;s con&s;i&s;ted in an over&s;trained piety; a fault which I am very willing to forgive, becau&s;e it ari&s;es almo&s;t never from a bad heart, rarely from hypocri&s;y, and almo&s;t generally from &s;tupidity and ignorance. An artle&s;s heart &s;u&s;pects no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">olds in tho&s;e of others, and therefore is ea&s;ily impo&s;ed upon.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="037761_0161_100F05B642F2F1A0">
"When one of my cou&s;ins introduced me the fir&s;t time to her, &s;he was &s;itting in the mo&s;t pic|ture&s;que attitude. She was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">itting in a leather arm-chair, dre&s;&s;ed in a brown wor&s;ted gown, and a night-cap. Both temples were covered with black plai&s;ters, of the bigne&s;s of a crown-piece, again&s;t head ach, rheumati&s;m, &amp;c. &amp;c. A tooth from a &s;cull, &s;ewed in a piece of &s;ilk, depended from her faded bo&s;om, which was to &s;erve as a tali&s;man again&s;t the tooth ach. The fragment of her no&s;e was adorned with a pair of green &s;pecta|cles, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of which &s;he was reading a chapter from Ezekiel. Her wrinkled hands knitted at the &s;ame time a &s;tocking of coar&s;e yarn, and the nodding of her head, the langour and blinking of her half-clo&s;ed eyes, betrayed that &s;he, at the &s;ame time, enjoyed the &s;weetne&s;s of &s;leep, and, con&s;equently, was employed in three differ|ent ways.</P>
<P>"I made a courte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y at the door; her lap-dog barked, and tore a whole in my apron, becau&s;e he mi&s;took me for a beggar; and the old lady took her &s;pectacles for a moment from her no&s;e, to make a &s;ilent &s;ign to me to take a &s;eat upon a &s;traw &s;tool, which &s;tood behind the door. When I had &s;eated my&s;elf &s;he continued to read aloud, (for my arri|val had di&s;pelled the god of &s;leep from her run|ning eyes,) beginning every ver&s;e an octave deep|er than &s;he fini&s;hed it, and concluding every ver&s;e with a &s;igh.</P>
<P>"Having fini&s;hed the chapter, &s;he marked the place where &s;he had left off with a piece of green &s;ilk, put her &s;pectacles into a &s;hagreen ca&s;e, and waddling towards me, to &s;urvey me from top to toe, with a mo&s;t curious loquacity. Her fir&s;t ad|dre&s;s was not very encouraging for a timid girl of my age. <HI>You are, probably,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, <HI>a daughter of Mr. Summer, who broke &s;ix months ago?</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="037761_0162_100F05B7C76328B8">
The&s;e words lacerated my heart. However, I collected my&s;elf. Benevolent minds, thought I, are not always endowed with delicate &s;entiments. <HI>You are poor and deserted,</HI> continued &s;he, <HI>but you have received a handsome figure from the mercy of God, and must make a good use of it.</HI> I then did not under&s;tand the horrid meaning of the&s;e words. <HI>You have met, in Lady Anna Maria of Xantippen|dale, with a sinner who has found grace before God, and is of a charitable disposition,</HI> concluded &s;he; <HI>and if you are diligent, and walk in the paths of modesty and piety, and always follow the advice of an experienced and pious woman, you will never lack any thing that may be requisite for the well|being of your body and soul.</HI></P>
<P>"I thanked her with a &s;incerely affected heart, for my lamentable &s;ituation cau&s;ed me to read pure benevolence in every countenance, and I imagin|ed that every eye be&s;poke tho&s;e &s;entiments which I would have felt my&s;elf for every unfortunate be|ing. I performed, therefore, cheerfully, my new duties, which chiefly con&s;i&s;ted in female work. The old woman &s;eemed to be &s;atisfied, and all went off extremely well till after &s;upper. But &s;carcely had the &s;ilver bell of Lady Anna Maria of Xantippen|dale convoked all the dome&s;tics to a&s;&s;i&s;t at her u&s;ual evening devotions, when a malicious daemon &s;ow|ed the fir&s;t &s;eeds of di&s;cord between us.</P>
<P>"Here I have the be&s;t opportunity of pourtray|ing to you, in one groupe, the inmates of our hou&s;e, whom I &s;aw the fir&s;t time on that pious oc|ca&s;ion. Nicolaus, a &s;quare-bodied coachman, had been thirteen years in the &s;ervice of Lady Xan|tippendale, although &s;he kept neither hor&s;es nor a carriage &s;ince the death of her hu&s;band. Her avarice, which, on every other occa&s;ion, was ter|rified at every u&s;ele&s;s expence, was obliged to give way, in this in&s;tance, to Chri&s;tian charity,
<PB N="9" REF="037761_0163_100F05B9BAA2D570">
becau&s;e that very &s;ame coachman had drove her late lord &s;even years to the town-hou&s;e, and at la&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;ted in conveying him to the grave. She could not, therefore, re&s;olve to leave him to the fortune of his whip. He was a round, healthy-looking figure, &s;ang a &s;onorous ba&s;s, and always began the evening hymn, which was &s;ung when the devo|tion was over, with great dignity.</P>
<P>"The &s;econd figure which entered the apart|ment, was a dirty man-&s;ervant, who was ju&s;t come from the field. His face was &s;un-burnt, and his hands were covered with bli&s;ters. He was chew|ing when he took his &s;eat, and his fatigue and hun|ger &s;eemed to cur&s;e the artificial devotion which he was forced to di&s;play. He was followed by two females, one of whom was very old and fret|ful, and the other young, gay, and apparently, more di&s;po&s;ed to laugh than to pray. The former was the cook, and the latter the hou&s;e-maid.</P>
<P>"The devotion was opened with an edifying hymn, after the conclu&s;ion of which Lady Xan|tippendale &s;aid a prayer which &s;he had learnt by heart, exhorting me to do the &s;ame. I confe&s;&s;ed frankly that I never had learnt a prayer by heart, and that I was convinced God paid little regard to the blabbering of our lips, being &s;atisfied with the pious emotions of our hearts. She prote&s;ted with a deep groan, that my youthful heart was already infected with the baneful poi&s;on of libertini&s;m: lending me immediately a prayer book which con|tained prayers for every day in the year, the leap-year not excepted, and exhorted me to &s;hew atten|tion and devotion during the pious ori&s;ons of the re&s;t of her dome&s;tics.</P>
<P>"The coachman roared his prayer, while his breath la&s;ted, without paying any attention to &s;tops and half &s;tops; the &s;ervant, whom the hou&s;e-maid &s;ecretly pinched and teazed, followed his example
<PB N="10" REF="037761_0164_100F05BC2160C108">
lu&s;tily. The cook alone groaned her prayer with all the expre&s;&s;ions of the &s;incere&s;t contrition. The devotion concluded with the hymn, <HI>Now all the woods are fast asleep,</HI> &amp;c. and the meeting was di&s;|&s;olved. She enjoined me once more before I went to bed, to &s;tudy her prayer book, under-lining with her own hand tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages which in her opinion were mo&s;t moving. I was obliged to learn every day two prayers by heart, and dur&s;t not attempt to alter an ob&s;olete or an ambiguous word arbitrarily. "Thou &s;halt not add unto the word, neither &s;halt thou dimini&s;h aught from it," &s;aid &s;he, whenever I attempted the &s;lighte&s;t alteration. She po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;ingular gift to prove any thing from the Bible, citing &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages out of its connexion, and thus rendering it &s;ub&s;ervient to confirm what &s;he want|ed to demon&s;trate. However, I begin to talk wildly; excu&s;e the joyful loquacity of the liberated dove who has e&s;caped from her cage.</P>
<P>"Our mode of life was nearly as follows: We ro&s;e very early in the morning. I was compelled to &s;ew, my fingers &s;ore while I a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the read|ing of the Revelation of St. John, which &s;he ex|pounded to me, ver&s;e after ver&s;e, prote&s;ting &s;olemn|ly that &s;he had di&s;covered in it the downfall of the Pope ten years ago, and al&s;o had written to him to warn him again&s;t the wicked French, but never received an an&s;wer.</P>
<P>"About noon we went together into the kitchen, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the cook in preparing a frugal dinner; or, to &s;peak the truth, we watched Mary, to prevent her from wa&s;ting too much butter, or poi&s;oning the victuals by adding too great a quan|tity of &s;pice. After dinner Lady Xantippendale always took a nap, and I was kept clo&s;e at work. She made her appearance again at four o'clock, and combed her lap-dog. She then went again into her clo&s;et to tran&s;act &s;ome private bu&s;ine&s;s, ex|amining
<PB N="11" REF="037761_0165_100F05BE9106FE58">
her pledges, winding up the pawned watches, counting and filing her ducats. Every half an hour which &s;he could &s;pare before &s;upper, was devoted to reading in the Bible. Our &s;upper was as frugal as the dinner, con&s;i&s;ting in a few thin &s;lices of bread. The above mentioned evening devotion &s;erved in lieu of the de&s;ert; and when it was over, we were permitted to go to bed. This is a faithful picture of our daily mode of life, which was never altered in the &s;lighte&s;t degree, except on a Sunday; when we went twice to church, and in the afternoon critici&s;ed the dre&s;&s;es of our acquain|tances in&s;tead of reading in the Bible.</P>
<P>"Little as I reli&s;hed this manner of living, yet I took cheerfully up with all its inconveniencies, flattering my&s;elf with the &s;weet hope that I &s;hould be &s;afe from per&s;ecution, and that my friend&mdash;why &s;hould I not &s;ay my lover?&mdash;would relea&s;e me one time from it. I began already to reconcile my&s;elf to it, and to court the favour of the old Lady by the mo&s;t unremitted attention: in which I apparently &s;eemed to &s;ucceed pretty well. How|ever, how great was my a&s;toni&s;hment and terror, when I, about a week &s;ince, entered the apartment of my mi&s;tre&s;s, and beheld the Colonel, whom I had not &s;een &s;ince that unfortunate day. A cold tremor ran through all my limbs; I was going to retire; but when he made me a re&s;pectful bow, and continued to conver&s;e with my mi&s;tre&s;s on money affairs, I tranquillized my&s;elf, fetched my work and &s;eated my&s;elf in a corner. The Colonel went with my lady into her clo&s;et, and they &s;taid near an hour and an half; I was &s;eized with fearful apprehen&s;ions, and trembled violently. My rea&s;on repre&s;ented to me that the vi&s;it of an officer who always was in want of money, was nothing extra|ordinary, con&s;idering the traffic which the old lady carried on. My heart a&s;&s;ented to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of
<PB N="12" REF="037761_0166_100F05C09739F7F8">
my rea&s;on; however, I trembled neverthele&s;s. He came back at la&s;t, walked with proud gravity through the apartment, and having made a &s;light bow to me di&s;appeared, I ca&s;t a &s;crutinizing look at the old woman, but could not perceive the lea&s;t change in her features. I per&s;uaded my&s;elf at la&s;t that the Colonel had given up all de&s;igns upon me, and thought no more of that incident.</P>
<P>"The day before ye&s;terday was the dreadful time when the enfernal plot was executed. The old woman had told me already the preceding eve|ning that a relation of her's, who lived fifteen miles di&s;tant from the town, would &s;end her carriage for her to take her a few weeks into the country, and that I mu&s;t get my&s;elf ready to go with her. I had no &s;u&s;picion, but rather was rejoiced at having an opportunity to breathe the country air again, and cheerfully packed up &s;ome linen and wearing ap|parel.</P>
<P>"A carriage and four appeared really the next day about noon at our door, the old woman delayed our departure till towards evening. The fir&s;t delay was occa&s;ioned by her afternoon's nap; having fi|ni&s;hed it &s;he went at lea&s;t twenty times all over the hou&s;e to &s;ee whether all was &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e; and when we, at la&s;t, were going to &s;et off, &s;he recollected &s;uddenly that &s;he had forgot certain papers which &s;he had promi&s;ed to her relation. Having rummaged all her drawers and carefully locked them again. &s;he went down in the kitchen to &s;ee whether the fire was quite extingui&s;hed. She then read a long lecture to her dome&s;tics, in which &s;he enjoined them to pre|&s;erve the &s;tricte&s;t order and economy; and when I hoped, at la&s;t that we were going to &s;et off, after I had been ready three or four hours, &s;he called me back again once more, putting a hymn book into my hand and croaking a hymn of a traveller who is going on a dangerous journey, I laughed inwardly, as I had not the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ion that my journey
<PB N="13" REF="037761_0167_100F05C21A731A58">
really would prove dangerous. I now can ea&s;ily ac|count for the &s;lowne&s;s with which &s;he prepared her|&s;elf for our final departure: &s;he was anxious to put it off till night &s;hould be &s;etting in; but I enter|tained not the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>"We got at la&s;t into the carriage, and took a road which was entirely unknown to me. The &s;un was &s;etting, when we perceived a village at &s;ome di&s;tance. There is a hou&s;e at the other end of the village, &s;aid the old woman, where we &s;hall re&s;t a little and take &s;ome refre&s;hment. We then &s;hall have only half an hour's ride to the &s;eat of my relation. I thought it &s;ingular that we were to re&s;t our&s;elves to eat and drink at a place which was &s;o near the &s;pot of our de&s;tination; however I &s;till entertained no &s;u&s;picion, becau&s;e I knew from experience that Lady Xantippendale was fond of regaling her&s;elf at the expen&s;e of other people, and was told that the hou&s;e belonged to a rich niece of her's. We really were received by a per&s;on, who pretended to be the &s;teward of her niece, and offered re|fre&s;hments to us. We &s;taid near an hour, and conti|nued our journey when the &s;hades of night already had &s;hrouded the fields in darkne&s;s. I perceived, notwith&s;tanding the darkne&s;s, to my utter a&s;toni&s;h|ment, that four white hor&s;es had been put to our carriage in the room of the black ones with which we had &s;et out. I communicated my a&s;toni&s;hment to the &s;teward, on getting into the carriage, and was told that the black hor&s;es belonged to his mi&s;tre&s;s, and that the lady whom we were going to vi&s;it had &s;ent her own hor&s;es. I was perfect|ly &s;atisfied with this explanation, and &s;u&s;pected nothing.</P>
<P>"We had not proceeded half a mile when the old lady &s;uddenly ordered the coachman to &s;top, telling me that &s;he mu&s;t get out a moment, and that I &s;hould remain quietly on my &s;eat. My art|le&s;s
<PB N="14" REF="037761_0168_100F05C4F13993E8">
heart &s;till apprehended no harm. But &s;udden|ly two ma&s;ked men jumped into the carriage, and the coachman drove on as fa&s;t as his hor&s;es could run. I &s;creamed and was gagged by one of my conductors. I prayed and &s;cratched; but my hands were tied; my recollection for&s;ook me and I fainted.</P>
<P>"As far as I can recollect, I remained &s;ome hours in that &s;ituation. The moon had ri&s;en when I recovered the perfect u&s;e of my &s;en&s;es. One of my conductors was &s;noring and the other betrayed his being awake, by coughing. I groaned and prayed to God for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The day began to dawn. My two conductors had pulled off their ma&s;ks. I concluded by their whi&s;kers that they were &s;oldiers.</P>
<P>"We arrived a few hours after day-break, at a lonely hou&s;e in a thick fore&s;t, where we were re|ceived by a fellow with long red whi&s;kers, and a pair of little pig's eyes. His dre&s;s was that of a pea&s;ant. He welcomed me with a civil &s;mile, and begged me to alight, and refre&s;h my&s;elf in his cot|tage. The &s;oldiers carried me out of the coach. I was very faint, and &s;ank upon a turf &s;eat, near the hou&s;e. One of my conductors, who&s;e eyes di&s;played a faint ray of humanity approached me. Make your&s;elf ea&s;y, Mi&s;s! &s;aid he &s;oftly; you are in good hands. Our ma&s;ter is generous and liberal; you will come to no harm. I now &s;hall take the gag from your mouth; but conjure you not to &s;cream; for, it would be of no &s;ervice to you, as we are in a place where no per&s;on can hear us; and I &s;hould be&s;ides be compelled to reduce you to a &s;ituation from which I &s;hould wi&s;h to pre|&s;erve you.</P>
<P>"He now took the gag from my mouth, and I began to &s;cream aloud, as &s;oon as I was at liberty. The fellow with the red whi&s;kers laughed, and his
<PB N="15" REF="037761_0169_100F05C78EF21490">
companion was in a violent pa&s;&s;ion; but the other &s;oldier who had &s;poken to me fir&s;t, &s;aid, in a tole|rably civil accent:</P>
<P>"Mi&s;s, I &s;hall &s;uffer you to &s;cream a few mo|ments, to convince you that no per&s;on can hear you. But if you do not leave off &s;oon, I &s;hall be compelled to be again trouble&s;ome to you. You &s;ee my comrade begins already to be impatient.</P>
<P>"But when I continued to &s;cream mo&s;t violent|ly in&s;tead of following his advice, he realized his menace, gagged me again, and conveyed me to a dirty room, which was blackened with &s;moke, and &s;melled of tobacco and the fumes of beer. The furniture con&s;i&s;ted of long deal tables, and benches on both &s;ides. The windows were hung with beer pots. Only a &s;ingle chair &s;tood in a cor|ner, and I was de&s;ired to &s;eat my&s;elf upon it. I was &s;ome hours in a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility. <HI>God be merciful unto me, and preserve my innocence!</HI> This was the only idea which occupied my &s;oul, and compo&s;ed my prayers. My conductors in the mean while, beguiled their time with taking their breakfa&s;t and &s;moaking tobacco, and were delight|ed to read the ob&s;cene rhimes which the gue&s;ts had written again&s;t the walls and windows.</P>
<P>"I remained in this melancholy &s;ituation till noon, when I was a&s;ked whether I wanted to dine? I refu&s;ed by &s;haking my head, and was urged no further. The &s;oldiers and the caroty fellow &s;at down to dinner and drank freely.</P>
<P>"After dinner, when the owner of the hou&s;e was occupied in the kitchen and the mo&s;t ferocious of my two conductors was fa&s;t a&s;leep, I was ac|co&s;ted again by his companion, in who&s;e eyes I perceived now and then a &s;park of humanity.</P>
<P>"Dear Mi&s;s, &s;aid he in a compa&s;&s;ionate tone, I pity you &s;incerely, I cannot &s;ave you, though I &s;hould wi&s;h to do it. But why do you your&s;elf
<PB N="16" REF="037761_0170_100F05C9117F1488">
render your &s;ituation more unplea&s;ant? You &s;ee that your &s;creams are of no &s;ervice to you; I will take the gag from your, mouth, if you will pro|mi&s;e me to be &s;ilent.</P>
<P>"The mild accent in which he delivered the&s;e words kindled a faint &s;park of hope in my &s;oul. This man, thought I, can &s;till take &s;ome intere&s;t in the unmerited &s;ufferings of others; I may, perhaps, be able to prevail upon him by my pray|ers to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in making my e&s;cape. I nodded to him, and was in&s;tantly di&s;engaged from the trouble&s;ome gag, and the cords with which my hands were tied.</P>
<P>"Oh! my friend! exclaimed I, wringing my hands: Oh! my friend! &s;ave my innocence! God and your con&s;cience will reward you for it!</P>

<P>I have told you already that I wi&s;h to be able to &s;ave you, for I am not &s;o inhuman as you may think, and I pity you. Upon my &s;oul I pity you &s;incerely: however I can do nothing for you.

But God ordained it otherwi&s;e; my pre|&s;ervation was decreed by Providence to be accom|pli&s;hed by your lord&s;hip. When I was ju&s;t on the point of quitting the room, the owner of the hou&s;e joined us, and left us no more. I was &s;eiz|ed with a &s;tunning agony. The &s;oldier &s;hrugged up his &s;houlder, &s;eated him&s;elf on a bench oppo|&s;ite to me, and leaning his head upon his hand, &s;urveyed me &s;ilently, and with evident marks of emotion.

He replied with a &s;igh, and to my great a&s;toni&s;hment a&s;ked me in French, whether I un|der&s;tood that language? When I affirmed it, he gave me the following account of him&s;elf:</P>
<P>"My father, &s;aid he, is an hone&s;t clergyman in the country, and now eighty years old. He gave me an excellent education, and endeavoured to animate my juvenile heart with love for virtue and probity. When I was nineteen years old, I was &s;ent to Univer&s;ity in company of a youth with whom I had been educated, and who was the only &s;on of an aged and poor widow in our pari&s;h. My father had taken him into his hou&s;e on ac|count of his amiable qualities, and cultivated his

mind. The cruel phantom of honour cau&s;ed us to fall out one day when we were intoxicated. We were in a numerous and licentious company&mdash;our companions urged us to decide our difference by a duel&mdash;they gave us &s;words&mdash;and I plunged mine into the heart of a young man, who was my only and &s;incere&s;t friend, and the la&s;t con&s;olation of a poor, aged, and di&s;con&s;olate mother, who &s;ur|vived his untimely death only a few weeks. I was obliged to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ly. My father gave me his cur&s;e, and my mother died of grief. I turned &s;oldier and endeavoured to &s;ilence my con&s;cience by aban|doning my&s;elf to the mo&s;t horrid exce&s;&s;es.&mdash;I &s;ucceed now and then&mdash;however, there are mo|ments&mdash;moments in which I quarrel with God and his providence, and my heart is &s;eized with the mo&s;t agonizing de&s;pair. Oh God! Oh God!&mdash;A &s;ingle &s;tep on the path of vice is &s;ufficient to ruin man for ever!</P>
<P>"He averted his face and was &s;ilent; however, I &s;till imagine to hear his la&s;t words. The tone with which he exclaimed: Oh God! was dreadful.</P>
<P>"The &s;un was already very high, and I think it was about three o'clock, when the other &s;oldier awoke, &s;wearing dreadfully, becau&s;e he had been &s;uffered to &s;leep &s;o long, and &s;colding prepared for our departure.</P>
<P>"Do you whine again? a&s;ked he his comrade, when he perceived his melancholy mood. Fie! be a&s;hamed!"</P>
<P>"I reque&s;ted the down-ca&s;t &s;oldier to tell me whither I was to be conducted? He a&s;&s;ured me, he did not know it him&s;elf; adding, they had received orders to conduct me over the heath of M** to a certain hill, where they were to meet the Colonel in the evening. I &s;aw no po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;caping <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fate. I prayed to God for a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and &s;oon felt my&s;elf animated again with new courage. I

now thought it was impo&s;&s;ible God could &s;uffer a being to be di&s;honoured, who always had adored him with innocence and purity of heart. I trembled indeed, when I got into the carriage; however, the fir&s;t frenzy of de&s;pair had abated; my &s;oul conceived again &s;ome hopes; and I thought at la&s;t, if the wor&s;t &s;hould come, I can only die. I am, perhaps called by God to die as a martyr for my innocence.</P>
<P>"They had gagged me again, but left my hands free. The carriage drove over unbeaten roads. We met not a &s;ingle per&s;on, and not a &s;ound of a living being, except the ru&s;tling of a &s;olitary lizard in the dry furze vibrated in our ear. One of my companions &s;ang very ob&s;cene &s;ongs, &s;moaked to|bacco, and &s;neered at his comrade who looked mournfully out of the window.</P>
<P>T"he &s;un had already concealed his radiant orb, and the darkne&s;s of the night was &s;etting in rapidly when we arrived at the hill, where we were to meet the Colonel. We &s;topt; but &s;aw no per&s;on. A &s;aint ray of hope ro&s;e in my mind, and I flattered my&s;elf with the cheerful illu&s;ion, that the villain perhaps had already received the reward of his crimes, had been thrown off his hor&s;e or attacked by robbers on his way. But alas!&mdash;two men on hor&s;eback appeared at &s;ome di&s;tance, a few hours after, when the moon had ri&s;en. My heart was convul&s;ed, my knees trembled, and I could &s;carcely &s;upport my&s;elf on my legs.</P>
<P>"Have I caught you at la&s;t, little rebel? ex|claimed the Colonel, while he ha&s;tily di&s;mounted and went towards me. My mouth was gagged; I ejaculated an inaudible &s;cream, ran furiou&s;ly to|wards him and &s;eized his &s;word, drawing it half out of the &s;cabbard. However he threw him&s;elf in my arms&mdash;I wre&s;tled with him&mdash;I was dragged into the thicket&mdash;de&s;pair gave me new &s;trength&mdash;

<P>Caroline's per&s;on was animated with new life and vigour, like a half-faded flower when a gentle &s;ummer rain refre&s;hes it with its re-invigorating moi&s;ture. A &s;oft ro&s;e-colour tinged her cheeks,

her brow and bo&s;om, and &s;pread even to the finger-ends; her eye &s;parkled like the morning &s;tar, when it announces the ri&s;ing &s;un.

<P>Caroline's heart beat violently; &s;he was &s;eized with a &s;weet namele&s;s unea&s;ine&s;s; the colour of
<PB N="22" REF="037761_0176_100F05D50388F3F8">
her face changed every moment; &s;he attempted in vain to &s;peak, and her impatient eyes roved in|qui&s;itively from one &s;ide to another.</P>
<P>The road &s;erpentined between gardens. Her imagination whi&s;pered to her, whenever &s;he per|ceived a cool inviting &s;pot: Ortenberg has, per|haps, been &s;itting there; on that meadow he walks in the refre&s;hing &s;hade of evening, re&s;ts here on the banks of this rivulet, thinks of his Caroline, and recalls to his memory the many happy hours which we &s;pent together. "Should we not meet him?" whi&s;pered <HI>Hope</HI> to her &s;i&s;ter <HI>Expectation.</HI> Expectation grew anxiou&s;ly attentive, gazed wi&s;h|fully at every di&s;tant object, and mi&s;took every child for the long mi&s;&s;ed lover; fancied to &s;ee in every pea&s;ant's coat the light grey frock in which he had taken leave of Caroline.</P>
<P>Elhenhor&s;t &s;at with folded arms by her &s;ide, and read with rapture the &s;lighte&s;t emotions of her heart, in the open book of her phy&s;iognomy. He read undi&s;turbed, without being interrupted in his &s;weet ob&s;ervations by a &s;ingle look of the dear girl; for Caroline had too much to &s;ee and to gaze at; had now to &s;tretch her neck, now had occa&s;ion to murmur &s;ecretly again&s;t nature for confining her looks by a hill; and now to be vexed at the &s;lowne&s;s of the po&s;tillion; and all the&s;e ideas and &s;en&s;ations cro&s;&s;ed each other with &s;o much rapidity, as to make her forget her companion entirely. She had eyes only for the &s;teeples of the town which lay before her; ears only for every &s;ound which proceeded from that direction; &s;en&s;ation only for her love.</P>
<P>The carriage now rolled round a hill, and be|hold! they were &s;uddenly before the gates of the town. A loud, tremulous Ah! e&s;caped Caro|line when &s;he beheld the gate.</P>
<P>"Go on! exclaimed &s;he to the po&s;tillion.</P>
<P>"I dare not proceed," replied the latter; the pa&s;&s;engers are examined here."</P>

"Good God!" &s;aid &s;he with an inchanting im|patience: "can they not &s;ee that I am no &s;py?"</P>

<P>"This lady?"&mdash;muttered the officer &s;miling. "However, I &s;hall put in my report: Baron El|henhor&s;t and attendants. I have the honour to wi&s;h you a happy journey."</P>
<P>The &s;neering tone and looks with which the officer &s;aid this, did not e&s;cape Caroline. She was &s;en&s;ible of the ambiguity of her &s;ituation; her cheeks glowed.</P>
<P>Elhenhor&s;t ordered the po&s;tillion not to put up at the <HI>Wild Man,</HI> becau&s;e he did not wi&s;h to embitter the approaching &s;cene of rapture, by the &s;ight of a villain. We &s;hall have time enough <HI>after</HI> dinner, thought he, to &s;ight out our differ|ence.</P>
<P>The carriage &s;topt therefore at another hotel, and the travellers were &s;hown into an apartment which had a clo&s;et adjoining to it. Elhenhor&s;t de&s;ired the trembling Caroline to &s;tep into it, and &s;ent for his friend.</P>
<P>Words cannot expre&s;s the &s;en&s;ations with which he looked through the window, and &s;aw Orten|berg coming up the &s;treet. His feelings were a mixture of rapture and anxiety&mdash;a tear &s;tole from time to time down his cheeks. He opened
<PB N="24" REF="037761_0178_100F05DA00011170">
the door of his apartment. Ortenberg a&s;cended the &s;tairs panting for breath, and&mdash;both lay in each other's arms.</P>
<P>"Friend, you have kept your word faithful|ly!" &s;aid Ortenberg, &s;haking Elhenhor&s;t's hand while he &s;tept into the apartment. "I did not expect you &s;o &s;oon."</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elhenhorst.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, deare&s;t friend, I have kept my word. I de&s;erve this te&s;timony. I promi&s;ed you to compel you to confe&s;s, on my return, that I de&s;erve your confidence. You only have let me gue&s;s your di&s;tre&s;s; but no matter of that: I gue&s;&s;ed it. Take this, continued he, taking the King's patent from his pocket: take this; the King has appointed you to be head ma&s;ter of the grammar &s;chool at W**.</P>
<P>Ortenberg&mdash;the indigent, &s;tarving Ortenberg&mdash;who had not the &s;malle&s;t glimp&s;e of hope le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t&mdash;rai&s;ed &s;uddenly to a &s;tate of moderate affluence, which enabled him to &s;atisfy all his wi&s;hes: Or|tenberg was &s;peechle&s;s, he &s;eemed to be rooted to the ground; he &s;tood before his friend with ex|panded arms, holding his cane in one and his hat in the other hand, while all his mu&s;cles trembled and tears &s;tarted from his eyes. He now gazed at the parchment and now at his friend. His lips quivered, his whole frame &s;hook, he could not find words, he was not able even to &s;tammer.</P>
<P>And behold: the folding door was &s;uddenly flung open, but not wide enough for Caroline's expanded arms. She flew towards her lover with a convul&s;ive Ah! which &s;eemed to reproach her rapture for its overflowing ec&s;tacy, and threw her trembling hands round his neck.</P>
<P>Elhenhor&s;t wept. His valet &s;tood at the door and &s;obbed. Ortenberg knew not whether he was awake or deluded by a &s;weet dream. He &s;taggered, wanted to &s;peak, he &s;tammered; El|henhor&s;t
<PB N="25" REF="037761_0179_100F05DB845275E8">
conducted him to a &s;ofa. His joy was too powerful for him. He re&s;embled a blind per&s;on who beholds the radiant orb of the &s;un the fir&s;t time, and fainted. Caroline threw her&s;elf upon him and hung upon his pale lips. Elhen|hor&s;t ordered him to be bled. He recovered the u&s;e of his &s;en&s;es, and a&s;ked him&s;elf whether he had dreamed.</P>
<P>We &s;hall leave the fini&s;hing of this picture to the imagination of the feeling reader, and let him gue&s;s the thou&s;ands of que&s;tions which were put and an&s;wered on either part.

Elhenhor&s;t had the greate&s;t difficulty to prevail upon his happy gue&s;ts to eat and to &s;peak; for they fea&s;ted only with their eyes. He was obli|ged to a&s;k more than ten times before he could receive an an&s;wer; but was teazed to repeat the &s;ame reply an hundred times.</P>

<PB N="28" REF="037761_0182_100F05E21520E7B0">
returned again without their perceiving it. They had not &s;een or &s;poken a word to Ortenberg's landlord, who &s;at only a few &s;teps di&s;tant from them. Ortenberg had &s;pilled half the contents of his coffee-cup on Caroline's lap, and Caroline had torn his ruffles with a pin; but neither knew any thing of it.</P>
<P>The carriages were ordered to be got ready. The old Citizen had crammed Ortenberg's little property in a portmantua, and &s;hed torrents of tears. All was now ready, the po&s;tillion blew his horn, the hor&s;es &s;tamped, Ortenberg took Ca|roline by the hand, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted her to get into the carriage. He had already put one foot into it, to follow her, when the old Citizen, who had been &s;tanding behind him, holding his hat in his hand pulled him by the coat, looking at him with tearful eyes, and &s;eizing him by the hand with|out &s;peaking a word.</P>
<P>"My benefactor!" exclaimed Ortenberg, while the tears gu&s;hed from his eyes, and threw him|&s;elf into the trembling arms of the old man.</P>
<P>"My &s;on!" &s;tammered the old man. This was all they were able to utter. The old man di&s;engaged him&s;elf from Ortenberg's arms, laid his hands upon his head, as if he were going to give him his benediction, and rai&s;ed his eyes to heaven. He &s;eemed to pray. He then &s;hook him violently by the hand, and &s;uddenly turned into another &s;treet.</P>
<P>The hone&s;t old man lo&s;t, by Ortenberg's de|parture, his only and la&s;t comfort, and &s;urvived it but a few weeks.</P>
<P>The travellers reached the place of their de|&s;tination in a &s;hort time, without complaining once of the badne&s;s of the roads; for their hearts were as &s;erene as the &s;ky. Ortenberg's arrival having been notified previou&s;ly to the citizens

His appointment, by an immediate order from the king, his winning mode&s;ty, Caroline's charming liveline&s;s, the friend&s;hip of a man of Elhenhor&s;t's con&s;equence; all this contributed to procure him the mo&s;t flattering reception at W**.</P>
<P>As Elhenhor&s;t, on account of the impending duel, pretended that the mo&s;t urgent bu&s;ine&s;s would not permit him to &s;tay long, the young couple celebrated their marriage a few weeks after his arrival. I &s;hall not attempt to draw a picture of that happy day; for Caroline's, Ortenberg's, and Elhenhor&s;t's feelings cannot be expre&s;&s;ed by words; as for the other gue&s;ts who were invited on that occa&s;ion&mdash;they ate, drank, played, laugh|ed, &s;ported their wit, and conducted them&s;elves perfectly as German gue&s;ts are wont to do on a German wedding. The young couple were teaz|ed by the jocund company, till&mdash;till Hymen join|ed hands with his brother Amor.</P>
<P>The new-married couple were yet fa&s;t a&s;leep in the morning, when the &s;macking whip of the po&s;tillion rou&s;ed Elhenhor&s;t. "God ble&s;s you!" &s;aid he, as he &s;tole by the bridal chamber on tip|toe: "May all your days be like this &s;miling ver|nal morning, and may you want for nothing but your departing friend."</P>
<P>The morning was beautiful. The pure picture of the ri&s;ing &s;un trembled in Elhenhor&s;t's parting tears. He wi&s;hed to have witne&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t rap|tures of his awaking friend&mdash;and the enchanting blu&s;hes of the lovely bride; however, he was bound by his word of honour, and flew through the gate, which ju&s;t had been opened.</P>
<P>The &s;erene &s;ky, the variegated verdure of the fields, and the beautiful banks of the Rhine di&s;|pelled the gloom which overclouded his mind.
<PB N="30" REF="037761_0184_100F05E6F93AB9F0">
Indeed nature can make any thing of us; we laugh and weep, we exult and mourn with that all powerful enchantre&s;s. Elhenhor&s;t experienced that change of feelings, and the confirmation of this truth.</P>
<P>Nature, that &s;ublime painter, charmed him till he came to Dui&s;burg, with the mo&s;t exhilarating pictures and groupes. The Rhine &s;erpentined before him, through fertile fields; floating &s;tream|ers decked its proud &s;urface, and the rays of the &s;un reflected from its blue waves. The melan|choly <HI>Ruhr</HI> &s;ought her maje&s;tic friend, creeping with &s;oft murmurs through rich meadows and or|chards, and ru&s;hing exulting in his arms. The ma&s;ts of light colliers appeared and di&s;appeared alternately between the clu&s;ters of trees which lined the banks. The milk girl came &s;inging from the pa&s;ture, carrying her clean ewer on her head; the wild dove cooed in the top of the tree, and the lark carolled her cheerful matins. The contented countryman earned with &s;erene &s;atis|faction the reward of his labour, the pipe of the &s;hepherd re&s;ounded through the plain, and &s;port|ing flocks gamboled on the verdant hills.</P>
<P>But when Elhenhor&s;t had left Dui&s;burg, and was going to cro&s;s the proud fore&s;t of oaks, which the ancient Romans already admired, clouds, big with thunder, towered on the &s;outhern horizon, and darkened the gloomy fore&s;t. The &s;torm roared in the tops of the maje&s;tic oaks, they mur|mured indignantly, lightnings whizzed through their branches, a heavy &s;hower of rain wa&s;hed their dark leaves. The hor&s;es who were brow|&s;ing in the fore&s;t, fled frightened in every direc|tion; the wild boar concealed him&s;elf in the thicket, and the &s;quirrel fled to find &s;helter in a hollow tree. Elhenhor&s;t's mind was over&s;pread with a melancholy gloom, anxious pre&s;entiments
<PB N="31" REF="037761_0185_100F05E87B7C9788">
&s;traitened his bo&s;om, and every fla&s;h of lightning appeared to him to unfold a dark futurity.</P>
<P>But he had &s;carcely left the fore&s;t behind, when the &s;torm cea&s;ed, the thunder was &s;ilent, and the &s;un emerged from the womb of the dark clouds in maje&s;tic &s;plendor, forming a radiant rain-bow in the moi&s;t atmo&s;phere. Every pearly flower perfumed the air with new fragrancy: the odori|ferous exhalations which emanated from the &s;park|ling meadows, refre&s;hed Elhenhor&s;t's languid frame, and the gloom of his mind fled as the clouds di&s;appeared from the horizon.</P>
</SP>
<P>"He arrived at Du&s;&s;eldorf at &s;even o'clock in the evening. When he mentioned his name at the gate, the officer who was on guard gave him a note, which had been left for him. It contained the following words:</P>

At nine o'clock! &s;aid Elhenhor&s;t, &s;oftly, and flung the letter on the table, without being vexed at the brutal wit and the fooli&s;h boa&s;ting of his an|tagoni&s;t. After dinner he wrote the following letter to Ortenberg:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Deare&s;t Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The world is ruled by prejudices, the fool and the wi&s;e obey them. The fool, becau&s;e he knows not what prejudice is; the wi&s;e, becau&s;e he is not always capable of de&s;pi&s;ing them with the contempt which they de&s;erve. Very &s;mall is the number of tho&s;e who&s;e un&s;hackled mind weighs every action in the balance of cool rea&s;on; and I mu&s;t confe&s;s that I am not one of them. I have received a challenge, and mu&s;t obey the fatal law of honour. If I &s;hould fall I beg you will accept the enclo&s;ed draft, as the la&s;t proof of my friend|&s;hip. Send it to Cleves, to my old faithful &s;tew|ard, who will ha&s;ten to execute the la&s;t commands of his ma&s;ter. I &s;hall be no more if you really re|ceive this letter; for, I have ordered William to deliver it only in that ca&s;e. Ki&s;s your lovely wife in my name. God ble&s;s you. We &s;hall meet again <HI>without fail!</HI></P>
</LETTER>
<P>The enclo&s;ed note was a draft of eight thou&s;and dollars. He al&s;o wrote a letter to his &s;i&s;ter, to who&s;e children he left his whole property, in ca&s;e he &s;hould be killed, recommending his old &s;tew|ard to them. He then took a walk, &s;aw the excel|lent gallery of pictures, and a few more remarkable objects, and went to bed at ten o'clock. He &s;lept &s;oundly till next morning, when William came to tell him that his hor&s;e was &s;addled.</P>
<P>He was at the appointed place a little before nine o'clock. The Colonel did not keep him wait|ing. They &s;aluted each other coldly. Each of them had only one &s;ervant with them. The &s;un was divided, and they agreed to fire at the di&s;tance

of eight &s;teps. Elhenhor&s;t did all this with &s;ilent caution, and a &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and coolne&s;s which &s;eemed to di&s;concert his antagoni&s;t a little. The Colonel changed colour &s;everal times, his hand trembled when he put the powder on the pan, and he &s;quinted with confu&s;ed looks from under his hat, at his cool-tempered antagoni&s;t, who &s;tood oppo&s;ite him in the calme&s;t po&s;ition, holding his pi&s;tols under his left arm, and looking at him with un&s;haken tranquillity.</P>
<P>"Will you &s;oon be ready?" a&s;ked he at la&s;t ra|ther impatiently.</P>

<P>The Colonel fled to Holland. His rich rela|tions hu&s;hed the affair up, and impo&s;ed upon the king. The villain was promoted &s;ix years after this incident to the rank of General, and appointed Governor of W**. His arrival at that place drove peace and contentment from the abode of hone&s;t Ortenberg. Caroline's death&mdash;Ortenberg's flight&mdash;all this is now no longer a my&s;tery to my readers.</P>

<P>Not far from W**, within the walls of which virtue &s;ought in vain an a&s;ylum in the lap of con|cealment, was a &s;mall village, inhabited by a race of excellent people. A wood of birch-trees, a cultivated hill who&s;e foot was wa&s;hed by the Ruhr,
<PB N="35" REF="037761_0189_100F05F1630B7368">
orchards and fertile fields &s;urrounded the cheerful valley, to which none of tho&s;e vices had penetra|ted, which di&s;grace the gorgeous-palaces of the great. Good natured, pious people &s;pent there their guiltle&s;s life in happy uniformity, which alone makes days glide away like hours. A cler|gyman&mdash;peace be with his a&s;hes&mdash;a clergyman who, as a pious teacher of virtue and a feeling man, led his &s;mall flock the road of true happine&s;s, and was a pattern of meekne&s;s and mode&s;ty, had lived twenty-&s;ix years among his pea&s;ants like a beloved father in the circle of his family. He was a &s;imple, hone&s;t man, devoid of intolerance and fanatici&s;m, and no enemy to the innocent plea&s;ures of life. His heart was without guile, his wife a pattern of dome&s;tic virtue, and &s;he al|ways had a mor&s;el of bread for the hungry, a draught of home-brewed beer for the thir&s;ty, and fellow feeling and tender con&s;olation for the af|flicted.</P>
<P>Conrad re&s;olved to retire to that village, and to try whether he could &s;upport his wife and fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ter|&s;on by the labour of his hands, which had long been unu&s;ed to work.</P>
<P>Barbara (&s;narling) packed up the few rags, which the kindne&s;s of the Governor had left to the hone&s;t old man as the only reward for his thirty years &s;er|vices. Conrad cau&s;ed an inventory to be made of Ortenberg's property, and depo&s;ited it with a friend of the unfortunate fugitive.</P>
<P>"Let us now depart in the name of God!" ex|claimed he, taking his &s;taff in one hand and the little William, who was eight years old, by the other: "let us turn our backs on this town, yet without &s;haking the du&s;t from our &s;hoes. May God mend tho&s;e that are not incorrigible, and par|don tho&s;e who are &s;tung by a repenting con&s;ci|ence.
<PB N="36" REF="037761_0190_100F05F2E5CED158">
Come, boy, let us wander to the huts of peace!"</P>
<P>William, who neither knew nor cared to know what his fo&s;ter-father meant by the <HI>huts of peace,</HI> tied his &s;mall bundle of linen to a &s;hort &s;tick, and as it ju&s;t &s;truck &s;even o'clock, rejoiced inwardly that he was permitted to &s;troll though the fields, in&s;tead of going to &s;chool, he was highly plea&s;ed with the change of his &s;ituation; and are we not all like children on &s;uch occa&s;ions? Even the in|telligence of a melancholy accident, makes, in the fir&s;t moment, an agreeable impre&s;&s;ion upon us, be|cau&s;e our &s;oul is con&s;tantly panting after a change of &s;en&s;ations.</P>
<P>The road to the neighbouring village led by the church yard. Conrad thought it would produce a &s;alutary effect, if he were to agitate the young mind of the artle&s;s boy by &s;en&s;ations which could not be expunged in the &s;olitude that was going to receive them, and, perhaps, might have an u&s;eful influence on his future life. He conducted him to the grave of his mother, which di&s;tingui&s;hed it&s;elf by the fre&s;hne&s;s of the clay.</P>
<P>"Kneel down!" &s;aid he to William, pro&s;trating him&s;elf upon the grave: "here is your good mo|ther entombed; &s;he hears us; her &s;pirit &s;oars round us. Do you &s;till recollect her?</P>

<P>Conrad had gained his purpo&s;e; William's heart was deeply&punc; affected. They quitted the church-yard. Conrad ca&s;t a la&s;t melancholy look at the grave of the good old Captain. No mar|ble monument told the pa&s;&s;ing wanderer who&s;e a&s;hes were re&s;ting here. Clo&s;e to it was a &s;plen|did mau&s;oleum of an u&s;urer, founded upon tears and groans of ruined widows and orphans.</P>
<P>They arrived at the village again&s;t noon. Old Conrad had made up his mind to reque&s;t a night's lodging of the fir&s;t inhabitant he &s;hould meet, and in ca&s;e of failure, to apply to the clergyman, who&s;e benevolence and humanity were generally known.</P>
<P>The villagers being ju&s;t employed in getting their harve&s;t in, he went through a great part of the place without meeting with a &s;ingle per&s;on. All the hou&s;es were open, but de&s;erted and un|guarded. The only living beings whom he &s;aw, were a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ew little children who were bathing in the rivulet which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">owed through the village. Now and then he heard the hollow voice of a hou&s;e dog.</P>
<P>Conrad perceived at la&s;t, before the door of a &s;mall but extremely neat hou&s;e, a man who &s;eem|ed to be of a middle age, and who&s;e whi&s;kers made it appear that he formerly had been a &s;ol|dier. He was &s;itting upon a bench beneath the &s;hade of a lime-tree, and had a &s;hort pipe in his mouth.

<P><PB N="38" REF="037761_0192_100F05F6D1AE2368">

<P>"Walk in!" &s;aid the ho&s;pitable countryman, in a good natured accent; "you are welcome to &s;hare with me the little I can give."</P>
<P>He conducted them to a neat apartment, re|que&s;ting his gue&s;ts to &s;it down on a bench, and regaling them with new milk, chee&s;e, bread and a draught of beer. While they were &s;atisfying the calls of nature, the following conver&s;ation en&s;ued:</P>

<P>Conrad went the next morning with his ho&s;t to church, and both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> them&s;elves in the gal|lery, ju&s;t oppo&s;ite the preacher. The venerable old man wore his own white hair, his eyes did not wander about among his congregation, his fi&s;t did not beat the pulpit, his arms fought not with the air; his folded hands lay quietly before him, and his artle&s;s di&s;cour&s;e went to the heart.

He &s;poke of youthful &s;ins, and ob&s;erved that ma|ny a &s;inner continued to walk on the road of vice, only becau&s;e he thought that his amendment would come too late. His exhortation was ex|tremely affecting and paternal, when he addre&s;&s;ed tho&s;e who had been deluded by the &s;educing phan|toms of vice; when he called to them in a heart-cutting tone, <HI>that it was never too late for a sin|ner to repent, and that a pious age, which was marked with many good deeds, could expiate a great number of transgressions.</HI></P>
<P>Old Conrad perceived with a&s;toni&s;hment, that the eye of his ho&s;t grew gloomy, and that he wiped the tears &s;everal times from his cheeks. "It is a fine &s;ermon," he thought: however, it could not make me weep. My ho&s;t mu&s;t have a very &s;u&s;ceptible heart."</P>
<P>When the clergyman concluded with the words, "Ye deluded &s;inners, return to the path of vir|tue; come and throw your&s;elves into the arms of virtue and piety; that the Lord may have mer|cy on your &s;ouls, when you are called hence!" he heard him &s;ob audibly. This appeared &s;ingu|lar to him. "It is impo&s;&s;ible," thought he, "that &s;uch a good and compa&s;&s;ionate man could have been a villain. What may be the cau&s;e that this &s;ermon made &s;uch a deep impre&s;&s;ion upon him?" He could not refrain from a&s;king his ho&s;t the rea|&s;on when they went home.</P>
<P>"Alas!" replied Unger, pre&s;&s;ing Conrad's hand violently, "I was a great &s;inner! I killed my bo&s;om friend in a fit of intoxication, brought the cur&s;e of my father on my&s;elf, broke the heart of my venerable mother, was driven by de&s;pair to turn &s;oldier, &s;erved in the regiment of Colonel V**, a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in the perpetration of many a nefareous deed, and God be prai&s;ed&mdash;was at la&s;t re&s;tored to virtue by a young lady.

<P>Conrad &s;tared with a&s;toni&s;hment at him. "Is it po&s;&s;ible, Mr. Unger? Did you really &s;erve in the regiment of Colonel V**, who now is Go|vernor of W**.</P>

This unexpected di&s;covery rendered the &s;itu|ation of poor William more comfortable. Un|ger had, indeed, not much, but what little he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, he &s;hared willingly and hone&s;tly with him. His father had died two years &s;ince, and enjoyed in his advanced age the plea&s;ure of be|ing &s;ix years an ocular witne&s;s of the repentance and amendment of his only &s;on. He did not tru&s;t to external appearances in the beginning, and apprehended his &s;on's conduct was nothing but a farce which he acted in order to be appointed his heir. But when four years had elap&s;ed and every one gave his &s;on the te&s;timony that he was the worthie&s;t character in the whole pari&s;h, his paternal heart was at la&s;t &s;oftened, he recalled his cur&s;e and exchanged it for his ble&s;&s;ing. Un|ger never rendered him&s;elf again unworthy of it. The recollection of his former deviations from the path of virtue, rendered him more cir|cum&s;pect, and all his actions were weighed in the balance of a rigorous con&s;cience. A per&s;on who has once lo&s;t his innocence and afterwards re|pents &s;incerely, is le&s;s expo&s;ed to the dangers of &s;eduction than un&s;u&s;pecting &s;implicity; and what is virtue which never has been tried nor over|come dangers and difficulties? nothing el&s;e but &s;ounding bra&s;s or a tinkling cymbal.</P>

<P>SIX years had already elap&s;ed in uninterrupted uniformity. Conrad carried on his profe&s;&s;ion, and as Unger let him live in his hou&s;e rent free, and be&s;ides, gave him all a&s;&s;i&s;tance his circum&s;tances could afford, he &s;upported him&s;elf hone&s;tly. The good clergyman in&s;tructed William &s;ome hours every day with his own children; the boy grew up, was healthy in body and mind, and would have been compleatly &s;atisfied with his fate, had not the &s;piteful Barbara frequently imbittered his &s;canty fare and childi&s;h plea&s;ures. She called him every day a beggar boy, and his father a good for nothing vagabond, who never would return again, and probably had long &s;ince died on a dunghill. This afflicted the lad mo&s;t painfully. He &s;at ma|ny a day in a &s;olitary bu&s;h and wept. Old Con|rad applied indeed the hor&s;ewhip, &s;ometimes, which always produced a momentary calm; how|ever he was of too peaceful a di&s;po&s;ition to be able to have every day recour&s;e to that expedient, and Barbara grew daily more fractious and &s;pite|ful, particularly after &s;he had failed in a certain de&s;ign upon Unger's heart, probably becau&s;e it

"Bravo!" &s;aid Ortenberg: "the&s;e are good a&s;pects. I do not think, friend Spiller, that my Negroes will have an opportunity here of making u&s;e of their &s;alivary talent." Welli! Welli! groaned he, when he &s;lept into the garden, and Conrad perceived a tear &s;tarting from his eye. The clergyman came to meet them, and both were the mo&s;t cordial friends before an hour had elap&s;ed; for, when two open-hearted and hone&s;t men meet, they feel in the fir&s;t minute benevo|lence, in the &s;econd confidence, and in the third love for each other; and the fourth cements their hearts with indi&s;&s;oluble bonds. Ortenberg at|tempted to force a ring of great value upon the hone&s;t clergyman, as a proof of his gratitude for having in&s;tructed his poor nephew &s;even years, without having had any pro&s;pect of being reward|ed. The ring was firmly rejected. "My heart," &s;aid the worthy man, "has rewarded me &s;uffici|ently for what I have done; you would rob me of this reward, were you to force me to exchange it for a jewel, which I even cannot value."</P>
<P>The hone&s;t &s;eaman was &s;en&s;ible that the clergy|man was perfectly right; however, it grieved him to appear to be ungrateful, and no &s;mile graced his &s;un-burnt cheeks till he had obtained the promi&s;e from the di&s;intere&s;ted old man, to be intru&s;ted with the fate of his two elde&s;t &s;ons. His looks brightened in&s;tantly up, and he now &s;crupled not a moment to reque&s;t the clergyman to take his nephew a few weeks in his hou&s;e, till he &s;hould return from Wernigerode, which was cheerfully granted. This &s;mall number of good people &s;eated them&s;elves round a table which was loaded with no other delicacies but fre&s;h butter and fruits; however, hilarity adorned their faces, from which no French cook had di&s;pelled the colour of health.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="037761_0207_100F0615C8009198">
Again&s;t the conclu&s;ion of the frugal meal, Or|tenberg whi&s;pered a few words in the ear of one of his negroes, who left the room, and &s;oon re|turned again with &s;ome bottles of cape-wine, a tobacco-pouch, made of buffalo &s;kin, and a long Indian pipe. "Heyday, children," exclaimed Ortenberg, when he &s;aw him come; "joy and mirth are not far off, when friends and wine are together. I can ea&s;ily perceive that you wi&s;h to know what has happened to me, during my long ab&s;ence from my native country? Alas! my friends, I have been guilty of many a fooli&s;h ac|tion.

<P>"YOU know, children, that I left Holland clande&s;tinely. The &s;hip in which I went, was de|&s;igned to &s;ail for Batavia; the captain was an hone&s;t fellow, and had promi&s;ed to procure me a place in the counting-hou&s;e of one of his friends at Java. No &s;tings of con&s;cience tormented me; becau&s;e all objects which I beheld, were yet too new to me, and my romantic imagination was too much occupied with vi&s;ionary dreams.</P>

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;ub&s;equent dreadful tale is literally true. If one or the other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> my readers &s;hould have read it already &s;ome|where el&s;e. I hope he will read it a &s;econd time without being angry with me for letting hone&s;t Ortenberg relate it in his own way.</NOTE> "The fir&s;t four weeks of our voyage bore a very propitious a&s;pect; the &s;ea was as &s;mooth as a mirror, and the wind favourable, when &s;uddenly, on a Tue&s;day, a misfortune befel us, the bare idea of which makes my hair bri&s;tle. I was &s;tanding on deck, conver&s;ing with the Captain, when &s;uddenly the cry of, fire! fire! &s;pread terror and confu&s;ion among the crew. All our men were in&s;tantly upon their legs, the Captain flew down into the hold, and I was clo&s;e at his heels, my heart beating violent|ly in my brea&s;t.</P>
<P>"Where is the fire?"</P>
<P>"Here, Captain, here!" exclaimed the pale &s;ailors, pointing at a ca&s;k. We put our hands upon it, but could not perceive the lea&s;t heat.</P>
<P>"Boys, you are mad!" exclaimed the Captain: "how can you make &s;uch a confounded noi&s;e about nothing?" What is the matter?</P>
<P>"Every one wanted to &s;peak fir&s;t."</P>
<P>"Silence, my lads! let the Mate &s;peak! The Mate related, that the cabin-boy had gone down to fetch &s;ome brandy, and had &s;u&s;pended his lamp to the ca&s;k which lay upon that from which he drew the liquor. A &s;park from the wick fell unfortunately into the bung-hole, the brandy caught fire, the ca&s;k bur&s;t, and the burning liquor got among the charcoals. Some pails of water were poured upon the coals, and the fire &s;eemed to be entirely extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>"Water! more water! exclaimed the captain: "pour a deluge on the coals."</P>
<P>"The coals began to &s;wim. "It is of no con|&s;equence!" &s;aid the Captain to me. We went a|gain upon deck, re&s;uming our conver&s;ation and &s;moaking our pipes.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="037761_0210_100F061CD9ADC2D0">
"But what &s;hould happen? Half an hour after, we heard again violent cries of fire. The Captain flew down, and I after him. It was a confounded ugly bu&s;ine&s;s. The flames beat in our faces, the fire had &s;pread among the coals, and the danger was the more pre&s;&s;ing as three rows of brandy ca&s;ks were piled upon one another, contiguous to the coals. An immen&s;e quantity of water was poured upon them, when a new misfortune added to the danger of our &s;ituation. The half extingui&s;hed coals cau&s;ed &s;uch a thick, &s;ulphurous, and benumb|ing &s;moak, that we were in danger of being &s;uffo|cated. However, we &s;truggled bravely again&s;t the impending danger. The Captain maintained his po&s;t like a man, commanding his people with the greate&s;t calmne&s;s, and the fellows relieved each other by turns, to re&s;pire a few moments on deck. However, &s;everal of the crew were &s;uffocated be|fore they could get out of the hold. I my&s;elf was obliged to lean my head again&s;t a ca&s;k, and to turn my face towards the opening, to draw a mouthful of pure air.</P>
<P>"Neither the Captain nor my&s;elf, could, at length, &s;tand it any longer; we were obliged to quit the hold, and I advi&s;ed him to order his gun|powder to be thrown over board. But he would not li&s;ten to my advice. "What the d&mdash;I &s;hall we do, if an enemy were to attack us?" I thought being taken was not half &s;o bad as being blown up. However, he was of a different opinion, and the gun-powder remained where it was.</P>
<P>"The fire cra&s;hed and crackled in a dreadful manner, the &s;uffocating &s;moak grew thicker and thicker, and no per&s;on could &s;tay in the hold any longer. The fellows took to their hatchets, and cut holes through the lower deck, pouring floods of water down. Our long boat had been in &s;ea three weeks, and the little boat had al&s;o been launched,
<PB N="57" REF="037761_0211_100F061ECF902950">
becau&s;e it was in the way of our people. The general terror was dreadful, no land or &s;hip was near, and nothing could be &s;een but fire and water. Our people &s;lipped overboard, one after the other, and &s;wam to the boats, where they concealed them|&s;elves under the benches, intending to leave us in the lurch, as &s;oon as their number &s;hould be large enough.</P>
<P>"The &s;teer&s;man accidentally looked over board, and perceived the boats crowded with peo|ple; tho&s;e that were in the long-boat, called and beckoned to him; fear made him turn a traitor; he jumped over board and joined his companions. "But let us at lea&s;t take the Captain in!" D&mdash;n the Captain!" replied the fellows, "his command is at an end." They cut the cable and run away. I could not blame them for it; for every one is his own neare&s;t neighbour.</P>
<P>"I was &s;till on the lower deck, a&s;&s;i&s;ting the Captain. We worked till the &s;weat ran in &s;treams from our bodies, apprehending no treachery, when our people &s;uddenly exclaimed, "Merciful God! we are lo&s;t; the boats have given us the &s;lip!" You may ea&s;ily conceive how we &s;tared when we got on the upper deck, and &s;aw the fugitives row bri&s;kly away. But what could we do? The Captain order|ed all the &s;ail to be hoi&s;ted, and his people to en|deavour to come up with the traitors, being deter|mined to run them down, if they &s;hould refu&s;e to take us in.</P>
<P>"We &s;trained every nerve to overtake them; but Providence ordained it otherwi&s;e. We were within a cable's length from them, when they gain|ed the wind, and we &s;oon lo&s;t &s;ight of them.</P>
<P>"Children," &s;aid the Captain, "make your peace with God, and redouble your exertions, otherwi&s;e we &s;hall be inevitably lo&s;t. Run and throw the gunpowder overboard, before the fire reaches the barrels."</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="037761_0212_100F0620714EF0A8">
"Di&s;order and confu&s;ion prevailed in the ve&s;&s;el; &s;ome ran to the powder barrels, others drew water, and the carpenters endeavoured to bore holes into the &s;hip, in order to fill <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> 1 1-2 foot with water, but could not penetrate, becau&s;e the covering of her bottom was lined with &s;trong iron plates. When this la&s;t expedient to &s;ave the ve&s;&s;el mi&s;carried al&s;o, the crew &s;et up the mo&s;t terrible lamentations, which made my hair &s;tand erect.</P>
<P>"Do not give way to de&s;pair," &s;aid the Captain, "God may yet pre&s;erve us, more water my lads!"</P>
<P>"More water was poured down; de&s;pair gave us additional &s;trength; we poured torrents upon the flame, and the fury of the sire &s;eemed to abate.</P>
<P>"However, our joy was of a &s;hort duration. The oil ca&s;ks caught fire, a circum&s;tance which rendered our &s;ituation &s;till more de&s;perate. The more water we poured upon the flame, the more furiou&s;ly did it blaze, &s;preading farther and farther. My &s;en&s;es almo&s;t denied me their &s;ervice, and a cold tremor ran through my frame. Yet we con|tinued our labour with unabating a&s;&s;iduity, carrying water into the hold, and throwing powder barrels over board. We had already flung &s;ixty barrels in|to the &s;ea; however, there were &s;till three hun|dred left: they took fire, and the &s;hip blew up, and was &s;hivered into millions of pieces in a twink|ling of an eye.</P>
<P>"I was ju&s;t &s;tanding on deck, by the main-ma&s;t, commanding &s;ixty-three men, who were drawing water, there being &s;till an hundred and nineteen people on board. We flew like lightning into the air. I expanded my arms, thought once more of God&mdash;which but too many do fir&s;t when they are at the brink of eternity&mdash;and found my&s;elf &s;udden|ly in the water, among the wrecks of the ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>"Love of life &s;oon re&s;tored me to the u&s;e of my &s;en&s;es; I looked round me and beheld the main.
<PB N="59" REF="037761_0213_100F0623C9953B58">
ma&s;t at my right and the fore-ma&s;t at my left hand I got upon the former, and groaning, contempla|ted the dreadful &s;cene of de&s;truction which exhibi|ted it&s;elf to my eyes. Not one living &s;oul be&s;ides my&s;elf was to be &s;een. I was on the brink of de&s;pair, cur&s;ed the hour of my birth on account of my impending de&s;truction. I thought of my father without tears, of God without murmuring, and be|moaned the juvenile ra&s;hne&s;s which had involved me in that lamentable &s;ituation. I was already on the point of plunging into the water, to &s;horten the agonies of death, when my dog rai&s;ed his head above the waves and &s;wam towards me. Words cannot expre&s;s the &s;en&s;ations which I felt on &s;eeing that faithful animal. The feelings which agitated my mind were &s;o powerful as to draw tears from my eyes for the fir&s;t time &s;ince my infancy. "Poor fellow!" exclaimed I, "come and die with your ma&s;ter!"</P>
<P>"The dog came nearer and crawled upon the ma&s;t; however it turned it&s;elf &s;o frequent|ly under me, that I had the greate&s;t difficulty to keep my&s;elf upon it, and the dog was repeatedly thrown into the water. I endeavoured therefore to lay hold of a flat piece of the &s;teerage, upon which I &s;aved my&s;elf with the dog.</P>
<P>"Fear of death had hitherto &s;uperceded every &s;en&s;ation of bodily pain, but I now began to be &s;en|&s;ible of the con&s;equences of my fall. My back|bone &s;eemed to be fractured, and my head was wounded in two different places. I was &s;eized with a kind of in&s;en&s;ibility, and the dog licked my wounds.</P>
<P>"Towards evening I recovered the full u&s;e of my &s;en&s;es, and ca&s;t my eyes all around in hopes of di&s;covering the long-boat. I actually &s;aw it; but at a very great di&s;tance. The &s;un was &s;etting, and my la&s;t hopes declined with the light of day. I
<PB N="60" REF="037761_0214_100F06254C7A5600">
began to prepare for death, Oh! my friends, the hour of di&s;&s;olution is an awful and trying one; e&s;pecially when we have not acted as we ought to have done. Con&s;cience awakes in tho&s;e moments and exerci&s;es its natural right. That dreadful re|membrancer then recalls to our recollection every folly which we have committed, and makes us pay dear for every tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of our duty. We ought, indeed, always to a&s;k our&s;elves, before we commit any action; would you act thus if this were the la&s;t hour of your life? and, believe me, we then would act differently in many in&s;tances.</P>
<P>"All my &s;ins crowded on my recollection; I imagined I &s;aw my poor father and my mother be|fore me. That night was the mo&s;t agonizing period of my whole life. However, I thank God for it: it recalled me to the path of virtue. I was a raw and thoughtle&s;s young man, and nothing but &s;uch a &s;evere trial could have made me &s;en&s;ible of my errors.&mdash;</P>
<P>"I committed my&s;elf to the mercy of the waves all the night, and my dog whined by my &s;ide. The darkne&s;s which &s;urrounded me was at length di&s;|pelled by the dawn of day, and&mdash;imagine how great my joy was&mdash;the long-boat was not above &s;ixty yards di&s;tant from me. I called as loud as I could: "For God's &s;ake, &s;ave poor Ortenberg!</P>
<P>"Several &s;ailors heard me. "Ortenberg is not dead!" exclaimed they, and rowed towards me. However, as the piece of &s;teerage upon which I was &s;itting was entirely &s;urrounded by the wrecks of the &s;hip, they were afraid to come near me, apprehending that they &s;hould run foul of the large pieces of timber which floated on the water. They called my dog, but the faithful animal refu&s;ed to leave his unfortunate ma&s;ter. They de&s;ired me to &s;wim to the boat; however, my wounds had im|paired my &s;trength too much.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="037761_0215_100F0626D0AE2058">
"The pur&s;er plunged at length into the water, and brought me a line which I tied round my wai&s;t. Thus I got &s;afely into the boat, where I met Van Hoorn, the fir&s;t mate. The crew &s;urveyed me &s;ometime with &s;peechle&s;s a&s;toni&s;hment, and per|mitted me to retire to a kind of cabin in the hind part of the boat, where two people could &s;it. There I recovered a little from my pains and terror.</P>
<P>"But what &s;hould we do now? I advi&s;ed Van Hoorn to keep near the wreck till day break, ex|pecting we &s;hould be able to pick up &s;ome provi|&s;ions, with which our people were but &s;cantily pro|vided, and, perhaps, find a compa&s;s; but was told "that the &s;econd mate, perceiving that the crew were preparing to quit the &s;hip, had taken it out of the cabin and gone to the bottom along with it.</P>
<P>"As for the provi&s;ions, Van Hoorn did not think proper to follow my advice, although I a&s;|&s;ured him "that I had been &s;urrounded with barrels of chee&s;e and &s;alt meat the preceding even|ing when I had been &s;itting on the ma&s;t." We plied our oars diligently, expecting we &s;hould &s;ee laud after &s;un ri&s;e. The &s;un ro&s;e, we had lo&s;t &s;ight of the wrecks of the ve&s;&s;el, but could &s;ee no land. Our people grew quite faint-hearted. They agreed that I &s;hould be their Captain, becau&s;e they knew that I had &s;ome knowledge of navigation. I crept forth from my little cabin to review my people who &s;eemed to be quite exhau&s;ted with row|ing. I inquired what provi&s;ions they had, and they &s;hewed me eight pounds of bi&s;cuit which was their whole &s;tock.</P>
<P>"I forbade them in&s;tantly to row, becau&s;e they had no means of refre&s;hing them&s;elves. I order|ed them to pull off their &s;hirts and to make &s;ails of them. But where &s;hould we get thread? We were obliged to untwi&s;t the lines which were in the boat
<PB N="62" REF="037761_0216_100F0628F3DCB7D8">
and to &s;hift as well as we could. We had &s;oon patched all our &s;hirts together and made &s;mall &s;ails of them. Our fellow-adventurers in the other boat followed our example.</P>
<P>"Our whole number con&s;i&s;ted of &s;eventy-two people, namely, forty-&s;ix in the long-boat, and twenty-&s;ix in the other. They provided me, on account of my mangled body, with a blue cloak and a blanket, the only cover which we had &s;aved. Our &s;urgeon was one of tho&s;e who had &s;aved them|&s;elves in the long-boat, but had not a &s;ingle medi|cine. He put a poultice of bi&s;cuit on my wounds, and they mended rapidly, nature being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by my &s;ound blood. I had offered my &s;hirt to be likewi&s;e applied for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ails; however, my companions would not take it.</P>
<P>"We &s;ailed with a fre&s;h breeze, and had no other guide but the &s;tars. The day on which I was &s;aved by the crew of the long-boat, was the twentieth of November.&mdash;The heat was intolera|ble in the day-time, the &s;un &s;tanding directly over our heads, and my teeth chattered at night with cold, again&s;t which my dog alone protected me in &s;ome degree. We were occupied on the twenty-fir&s;t of November and the two following days in compo&s;ing a Jacob's &s;taff, to take the altitude. The &s;hip's carpenter, who al&s;o knew &s;omething of navigation, a&s;&s;i&s;ted me faithfully, and we &s;ucceed|ed, at la&s;t, after much trouble, in fini&s;hing an in|&s;trument which an&s;wered our purpo&s;e tolerably well. I drew a map upon a board, &s;ketching Java and Sumatra, with the &s;traight which divides them, upon it.</P>
<P>"I had taken the altitude already on the fir&s;t day of our mi&s;ery, and found that we were in the fifth or &s;ixth degree of the Southern latitude, and con&s;equently, only about 100 miles from land. I repeated my ob&s;ervations every day. We divided
<PB N="63" REF="037761_0217_100F062AF0058888">
the &s;even or eight pounds of bi&s;cuits which were in our po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, in equal &s;hares and every one of us received his daily allowance as long as it la&s;ted. We al&s;o had nothing to drink, neither of the two boats being provided with water. We &s;pread our &s;ails when it rained, and after they were &s;oaked through &s;queezed the water into two &s;mall ca&s;ks, the only ones which we had. This water &s;erved us in the day time to quench our thir&s;t; an old &s;hoe was our goblet.</P>
<P>"My companions in&s;i&s;ted notwith&s;tanding our great want, upon my eating and drinking my fill, alledging that they could not navigate the boats without my advice, and that the diminution of provi&s;ions, which this occa&s;ioned would not be much perceived. However, I took no more than the re&s;t; and &s;lipt now and then a mor&s;el into the mouth of my dog. The other boat was in as de&s;|perate a &s;ituation as ours, and the crew apprehend|ed, be&s;ides to be &s;eparated from us by a &s;torm, e&s;pecially as not one of them had a &s;ufficient knowledge of navigation, and our boat &s;ailed much better than theirs. They conjured us therefore frequently to take them into our boat; however, our people would not li&s;ten to their reque&s;t, for fear of expo&s;ing our&s;elves to the greate&s;t danger.</P>
<P>"We were at la&s;t reduced to the highe&s;t degree of mi&s;ery; our bi&s;cuit was con&s;umed, and no land could be &s;een. Hunger raged in our entrails&mdash;I was obliged to &s;ee&mdash;that my dog&mdash;who had licked my wounds&mdash;warmed my feet&mdash;."</P>
<P>Here Ortenberg faltered, an involuntary tear &s;tarted from his eye; he attempted &s;everal times to continue his narrative, however, his emotion denied him the power of utterance, and his au|ditors could not help being affected by the feelings of the venerable narrator, which &s;poke more powerfully to the heart than words could have done. Every eye was moi&s;tened.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="037761_0218_100ED4D8EE57E440">
Ortenberg re&s;umed at length: "Children I cannot &s;peak of the dog; upon my &s;oul, I cannot!" A pau&s;e.</P>
<P>"However, what &s;hould happen? The crew began to murmur. I exerted my little eloquence, to per&s;uade them that it was impo&s;&s;ible we could be far from land; but I attempted in vain to pacify them.</P>
<P>"They told me to my face, that I impo&s;ed upon them and my&s;elf, and had &s;teered into the main ocean in&s;tead of &s;ailing towards the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>"When we were reduced to the greate&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, Providence &s;ent us a great number of mews, who hovered a con&s;iderable time over our long boat which enabled every one of us to catch a few of them without difficulty. They were in|&s;tantly plucked and devoured raw. What a deli|cious meal! But what was <HI>one</HI> meal to half-&s;tarved and emaciated people? Two leaden days more elap&s;ed, and the tortures of hunger returned again, with additional fury.</P>
<P>"Since we all mu&s;t peri&s;h," exclaimed Van Hoorn: "let us die together and take our compa|nions into the long boat!"</P>
<P>"This propo&s;al met with no oppo&s;ition this time. We took the people, the oars and &s;ails out of their boat and left it to the mercy of the waves. We now had fifteen pair of oars in the long-boat which we divided among the rowers. We al&s;o were provided with a fore-ma&s;t, a mizen-ma&s;t, a large &s;ail and a bow&s;prit. The boat was pretty roomy. I divided the crew in two parties, one of which was &s;itting, while the other was working the ve&s;&s;el, and thus they relieved each other by turns.</P>
<P>"Heaven interpo&s;ed once more in our behalf &s;ending us a great number of flying fi&s;hes, which were as large as the large&s;t whitings. We &s;eized them with avidity when they dropt into the boat,
<PB N="65" REF="037761_0219_100F062D579765F0">
and devoured them raw. Again only a tempo|rary relief! We had, however, no &s;ick among us, which &s;urpri&s;ed me the more, as &s;ome of the crew had drank &s;ea-water, notwith&s;tanding my pre&s;&s;ing remon&s;trances. Some gnawed their flints and balls, and others even drank their own urine.</P>
<P>"Thus our di&s;tre&s;s increa&s;ed every hour, and death &s;eemed to gain gradually upon us. Heaven &s;ent neither rain nor mews, nor flying fi&s;hes to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and our meagre countenances di&s;|played the mo&s;t dreadful de&s;pair. Our people be|gan to &s;urvey each other with a kind of &s;avage fe|rocity; their greedy looks &s;eemed to devour the fle&s;h of their companions. Some began already to hint that no other expedient was left than to kill a couple of our young people. I &s;huddered at that horrid idea, my heart mi&s;gave me&mdash;I rai&s;ed my eyes to Heaven, and implored God, not to inflict &s;everer trials on us than we can bear. I conjured my companions in the mo&s;t affecting manner to &s;pare the young people. I &s;hewed them my map and the ob&s;ervations which I had made every day, and obtained at la&s;t, a re&s;pite of three days. However, they added, with the mo&s;t hor|rid oaths, that they were determined to execute their infernal de&s;ign, if we &s;hould not di&s;cover land within that time.</P>
<P>"Thus the leaden hours crept &s;lowly on, and the mo&s;t excruciating torments of body and &s;oul increa&s;ed every moment. I my&s;elf was almo&s;t tempted by de&s;pair, to agree to their &s;avage pro|po&s;al; however, we all were exhau&s;ted &s;o much the next morning, as to be &s;carcely able to &s;tir. Few of my companions were able to ri&s;e from their &s;eats, and Van Hoorn could not move a limb. Although my wounds had weakened me very much, yet I was one of the &s;tronge&s;t, and
<PB N="66" REF="037761_0220_100F062ED9C4F450">
&s;till could crawl from one end of the boat to the other.</P>
<P>The &s;ky began to be overclouded on the 2d of December, which was the thirteenth day after we had been &s;hipwrecked. It began to rain violently, which refre&s;hed us a little. The air being calm, we could &s;pread out our &s;ails, quench our burning thir&s;t and fill our ca&s;ks with water.</P>
<P>"I was ju&s;t &s;tanding at the helm, examining my map, and concluded that it was impo&s;&s;ible we could be far di&s;tant from land. I even hoped that the &s;ky would clear up while I was on my po&s;t; and that I &s;hould de&s;cry the long &s;ought &s;hore. However, the cutting wind, and the violence of the air drove me at length away. The Quarter-Ma&s;ter relieved me, and I crept into the mid&s;t of the croud, to warm my&s;elf a little.</P>
<P>"Not an hour had elap&s;ed, when the &s;ky cleared up, and the man at the helm exclaimed unexpected|ly: Land! Land! and we all were on our legs in an in&s;tant.</P>
<P>"The word <HI>land</HI> &s;eemed to have animated us with new life. All were eager to &s;ee the wi&s;hed|for &s;hore, and thronged, pu&s;hed and pre&s;&s;ed upon each other with &s;o much impatience, that I appre|hended &s;ome would fall overboard. The fellow had &s;een right: God be prai&s;ed! we were really in &s;ight of land. My companions wept like chil|dren; one ran again&s;t the other, and all were fran|tic with joy. I had great trouble to &s;et them to work; however, they &s;oon began to row as bri&s;kly as if every one had had a leg of mutton for break|fa&s;t. We crowded all our canva&s;s to make the coa&s;t; however the violence of the &s;urge prevent|ed our landing. We di&s;covered at la&s;t, fortunate|ly a &s;mall bay where we ca&s;t anchor, leaping on &s;hore as if the gates of Paradi&s;e had been thrown open before us.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="037761_0221_100F0631885EB340">
"We di&s;per&s;ed in&s;tantly in the woods in &s;earch of nouri&s;hment. I threw my&s;elf upon the ground, ki&s;&s;ing it with weeping eyes. The fir&s;t moment of &s;afety after we have e&s;caped &s;ome imminent dan|ger is un&s;peakably &s;weet. I was happier than words can expre&s;s, forgot all my lo&s;&s;es; thought of futurity without trembling, reflected with plea|&s;ure on the dangers which were pa&s;t, and every incident except the fate of my dog, which recur|red to my recollection, afforded me &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>"We found nothing upon the i&s;land but cocoa nuts; not even a drop of &s;weet water. We re|galed our&s;elves with the refre&s;hing juice which the young nuts contained, and with kernel of the riper ones.</P>
<P>"The juice was at that time a greater luxury to our palate than cape-wine, and we &s;hould have been prudent had we not drank too much of it. How|ever, people who had fa&s;ted thirteen days, could not be expected to be moderate. We all lay in the evening &s;prawling upon the ground, convolv|ing our&s;elves like worms; and our agonizing pains la&s;ted all night.</P>
<P>"We di&s;per&s;ed our&s;elves in the morning over the i&s;land, but could not di&s;cover a living &s;oul.</P>
<P>"There were, indeed, in different places, ve&s;ti|ges of human foot&s;teps; however, we could find nothing but cocoa nuts.</P>
<P>"We filled our boat with young and ripe nuts, and weighed anchor again&s;t evening, intending to look for the i&s;land of Sumatra, which we di&s;co|vered the next morning, the i&s;land where we had landed fir&s;t, being only a few leagues di&s;tant from it. We coa&s;ted the we&s;tern &s;hore of Sumatra while our provi&s;ions la&s;ted, till nece&s;&s;ity forced us at la&s;t to land. However, this was no ea&s;y ta&s;k, the &s;urge being extremely violent. Five of our be&s;t &s;wimmers got &s;afely on &s;hore, and ran down

the coa&s;t, to &s;ee whether they could find a conve|nient landing place, and coming at la&s;t to a river, made &s;igns to us to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> towards it.</P>
<P>We did it, but were prevented from working our ve&s;&s;el into the river; becau&s;e a bank again&s;t which the waves broke in a furious manner, ren|dered its mouth extremely dangerous. I was afraid to attempt working our boat through the tremendous &s;urge, without having previou&s;ly ob|tained the general con&s;ent of my companions. I placed them in two rows, and took the opinion of every individual. The fellows agreed unanimou&s;ly that we &s;hould brave the danger. Well then, in the name of God, let us run the ri&s;k! I &s;tationed two &s;ailors with oars at the &s;tern to pu&s;h the boat off in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, and Van Hoorn took hold of the helm to &s;teer the ve&s;&s;el through the roaring &s;urge.</P>
<P>"The fir&s;t wave almo&s;t filled the boat, and we were obliged to throw the water out with our hats, &s;hoes, and whatever implement we could find. A &s;econd wave covered us entirely, and we were ut|terly incapable of making u&s;e of the helm or the oars. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Boys!" exclaimed I, "pre&s;erve the equi|librium of the boat, and throw the water out as fa&s;t as you can, le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t we &s;hall all be lo&s;t." A third wave came&mdash;I recommended my &s;oul to the mercy of God; however, the &s;urge was already &s;o low, as not to be able to do us much injury, and we got &s;afely out of our perilous &s;ituation.</P>
<P>"We ta&s;ted the water, and were rejoiced to find that it was perfectly &s;weet. This di&s;covery made us forget all our pa&s;t &s;ufferings. We la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ded at the right bank of the river, where the &s;hore was covered with beautiful plants, among&s;t which we found a kind of &s;mall figs which I had ta&s;ted when in Holland. We made a mo&s;t delicious meal. Savoury ripe figs, &s;weet and clear water,
<PB N="69" REF="037761_0223_100F063571ABCA30">
were a treat which we had not expected to enjoy &s;o &s;oon.</P>
<P>Some of our people who had been roving over the i&s;land, found tobacco and fire, which gave us rea&s;on to hope that we could not be far from an in|habited &s;pot. We fetched our two hatchets from the boat to cut down &s;ome trees, and lighted large fires in different directions. My companions &s;eat|ed them&s;elves around them and enjoyed the to|bacco which they had &s;ound. We lighted an ad|ditional number of fires again&s;t evening, and three centinels were &s;tationed at the entrance of our little camp.</P>
<P>"The moon was in her wane; the fir&s;t half of the night elap&s;ed without any &s;ini&s;ter accident, ex|cept dreadful pains in our bowels, which was the effect of our having eaten too great a quantity of figs. I had ju&s;t began to feel my&s;elf a little bet|ter, and was going to lay my&s;elf down to &s;leep when our centinels informed us that the natives were advancing in great numbers.</P>
<P>"The night was extremely dark; I concluded therefore that their de&s;ign could not be of the mo&s;t amicable nature. Our whole &s;tore of arms con&s;i&s;ted, be&s;ides the above-mentioned hatchets, in an old ru&s;ty &s;word, and we were, at the &s;ame time, &s;o ill, as to be &s;carcely able to &s;tir.</P>
<P>"What &s;hould we do? We re&s;olved at lea&s;t not to die unrevenged. We a&s;&s;i&s;ted each other to get upon our legs, armed our&s;elves with fire|brands and ru&s;hed furiou&s;ly upon the enemy. The &s;parks flew far around, the &s;ight was dreadful, and the Indians took in&s;tantly to their heels. This was no more than natural; for, how could they have known how large our numbers were? They al&s;o could not gue&s;s that we had no other arms but a couple of hatchets and a ru&s;ty &s;word.</P>

"They retreated to the woods, and we &s;at down again round our fires, where we &s;pent a very un|comfortable night; for, we &s;tarted up when a lizard ru&s;tled in the dry gra&s;s. Van Hoorn had retired to the boat, to cover our rear in ca&s;e of an attack.</P>
<P>"Three Indians came the next morning with the fir&s;t dawn of day towards us from the wood. I di&s;patched three of my people, who already had made a voyage to India, and knew &s;omething of the language and the cu&s;toms of the country, to meet them.</P>
<P>"Of what nation are you?" was the fir&s;t que&s;|tion.</P>
<P>"We are unfortunate merchants from Holland, who&s;e ve&s;&s;el was burnt at &s;ea, and who are come to reque&s;t &s;ome provi&s;ions of you."</P>
<P>"While they were treating together, the In|dians proceeded towards the long-boat, to know whether we were provided with arms. However I had anticipated their errand, and ordered the &s;ails to be &s;pread over the ve&s;&s;el."</P>
<P>"Undoubtedly," &s;aid our people, "we have got plenty of mu&s;kets and more powder and ball than we &s;hall want."</P>
<P>"Upon this intelligence they marched off again, and promi&s;ed to bring us rice and fowls. They kept their word, and we gave them about &s;ix &s;hil|lings which we had collected among our&s;elves. They &s;eemed to be perfectly &s;atisfied with their bargain.</P>
<P>"A&s;&s;ume a commanding air," &s;aid I to our people, "and treat them as if you were at home here!"</P>
<P>"We &s;at down upon the gra&s;s with apparent unconcern&punc; and began to fea&s;t upon our purcha&s;e.</P>

"We enquired after the name of their i&s;land. They pronounced a great number of unintelligi|ble words; however, the word <HI>Sumatra</HI> was not among&s;t them. Neverthele&s;s, we were &s;till in hopes that the i&s;land where we were could be no other; becau&s;e they mentioned Java, and pointed with their hands towards the direction in which we &s;uppo&s;ed it mu&s;t be &s;ituated.</P>
<P>"You cannot conceive how much we were re|joiced at the &s;uppo&s;ed confirmation of our hopes; for, as it is not practicable to navigate the great ocean without a compa&s;s, we apprehended con|&s;tantly to rove at random on the exten&s;ive de&s;ert of the &s;ea from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and from we&s;t to ea&s;t, without ever gaining the object of our wi&s;hes. And what was our final object? It was no other than to reach a Dutch port, and to be again among Chri&s;tians. Blockhead that I was! I was never wor&s;e treated than among Chri&s;tians, and &s;pent the happie&s;t time of my life with an Heathen.</P>
<P>"All &s;eemed to be well; our people were cheer|ful and in good health, and impatient to quit the i&s;land; however, we were entirely de&s;titute of provi&s;ions. What &s;hould we do? We di&s;covered a kind of hamlet at &s;ome di&s;tance, and I re&s;olved to venture going up the river in a canoe, with four of my companions, and to buy, for the re|mainder of our money, as much provi&s;ions as we could get.</P>
<P>"We arrived &s;afely within a &s;mall di&s;tance of the hamlet. I &s;ent immediately rice and fowls to Van Hoorn, to divide them among&s;t our compa|nions. As for my&s;elf, I had a mo&s;t delicious meal with my fellow-adventurers. The beverage of the Indians, which they draw from a certain tree, was likewi&s;e not to be rejected, and almo&s;t got into our heads.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="037761_0226_100F063B6FC88370">
"The i&s;landers were &s;tanding around us, while we dined in public, and whenever we moved our hand to the plate, followed us with greedy looks, and devoured every mor&s;el with their eyes, before we could carry it to our lips. When we had fini&s;h|ed our meal, I purcha&s;ed a buffalo; however, the animal was &s;o wild and untractable, as to render it impo&s;&s;ible for us to lay hold of him, or to drive him before us.</P>
<P>"Time elap&s;ed rapidly, and evening began to be &s;etting in apace. I went towards the boat, in|tending rather to return again in the morning than to expo&s;e my&s;elf to the ferocity of the Indians. My attendants pre&s;&s;ed me to give them leave to &s;tay in the hamlet all night, pretending that they &s;hould be able to catch the buffalo in the dark. I attempted to di&s;&s;uade them from their dangerous de&s;ign; however they refu&s;ed to li&s;ten to my re|mon&s;trances, and I con&s;ented at la&s;t to let them do as they plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>"When I had almo&s;t gained the bank of the ri|ver, I met&punc; with a troop of Indians, who, as far as I could gue&s;s by their ge&s;tures, were con&s;ulting together whether they &s;hould let me pa&s;s unmo|le&s;ted or no. My &s;ituation was extremely dan|gerous. However, I &s;eized two of them by the arm, and pu&s;hed them with the air of a command|er who is not u&s;ed to be contradicted, towards the canoe. They looked ferociou&s;ly at me but never|thele&s;s got into the canoe, and began to row bri&s;k|ly. Both were armed with a dagger, or a <HI>crid,</HI> as they call it, and my life was con&s;equently in their power.</P>
<P>"When we had proceeded a little way, the hindmo&s;t came to me in the middle of the boat, where I was &s;tanding, and intimated to me by ge&s;tures, that he wanted money. I took a &s;mall coin out of my pocket, and offered it to him. He
<PB N="73" REF="037761_0227_100F063DE58C51E8">
contemplated it at fir&s;t with dubious looks, but at la&s;t wrapped it in a piece of Calico, which he wore round his wai&s;t. It was but natural that his companion al&s;o expected to receive &s;omething for his trouble. He came al&s;o towards me, and made the &s;ame ge&s;tures. I gave him likewi&s;e a piece of money which he turned round and round, and ex|amined on both &s;ides. He &s;eemed more undeter|mined than his companion, whether he &s;hould keep it or di&s;patch me, which he could have done ea&s;ily as I was quite de&s;titute of arms.</P>
<P>"You may conceive that I was rather unea&s;y at my &s;ituation. I was &s;en&s;ible of the greatne&s;s of the danger, and my heart beat violently. How|ever, he kept it at la&s;t, and we proceeded down the river with great celerity. When we had fini&s;hed nearly one half of our way, my two con|ductors began to talk with great heat, and I con|cluded by their ge&s;tures, that they &s;hould attack me both at once; I cannot deny that I trembled violently. I knew not what to do; and in the agony of my heart began to &s;ing with &s;o loud and vociferous a voice, as made the woods re&s;ound on both &s;ides of the river. My conductors were &s;eized with a violent fit of laughter, and &s;tared a few moments at me with a&s;toni&s;hment. I could conclude by their countenance, that they did not &s;u&s;pect me in the lea&s;t of fear or mi&s;tru&s;t; and thus learned by my own experience, what I fre|quently had heard a&s;&s;erted, but never would be|lieve, that a high degree of fear urges man to &s;ing.</P>
<P>"When I perceived that this expedient &s;uc|ceeded, I continued to &s;ing as loud as I could, while the boat proceeded down the river with great rapidity. I &s;oon got &s;ight of our boat, and made a &s;ign to our people with my handkerchief

unperceived by my conductors. They &s;aw it and fled to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>"I now endeavoured to make the Indians un|der&s;tand that they both mu&s;t &s;tand in the &s;tern of the canoe, if I &s;hould be able to get on &s;hore, be|cau&s;e I apprehended one of them would attack me from behind, while I quitted their ve&s;&s;el. They obeyed without the lea&s;t contradiction, and I join|ed at la&s;t my companions without having received any injury.</P>
<P>"The two Indians enquired carefully previous to their return, where we intended to &s;pend the night? We pointed at &s;ome huts, which we had con|&s;tructed of braches and leaves. They then en|quired where Van Hoorn and I intended to &s;leep? We replied, "in the long-boat under our &s;ails;" upon which they got into their canoe, and paddled away.</P>
<P>"I related to our people every thing that had happened to me, and gave them hopes that we &s;hould &s;ee our companions again in the morning, with the buffalo which we had bought. The night pa&s;&s;ed in death like &s;tillne&s;s; the &s;un ro&s;e, but we &s;aw neither our companions nor the buf|falo, and began to be very apprehen&s;ive about the &s;afety of the poor fellows. At length we &s;aw two Indians driving a buffalo; however I perceiv|ed in&s;tantly that it was not the &s;ame which I bought the preceding day. One of our people, who had a &s;mattering of their language, inquired after the cau&s;e of that exchange and what was be|come of my four companions. They pretended that the fir&s;t buffalo had been too wild and un|governable, and that our people would &s;oon fol|low them with a &s;econd. This appeared &s;u&s;pi|cious to me; for the buffalo which they had brought us, was as wild and untractable as that of the preceding day. I ordered the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to
<PB N="75" REF="037761_0229_100F06419435F340">
be knocked on the head in&s;tantly, for fear we &s;hould lo&s;e our purcha&s;e a &s;econd time.</P>
<P>"When the two blacks &s;aw the buffalo drop down, they &s;et up a mo&s;t dreadful howl, and from two to three hundred Indians ru&s;hed upon this &s;ignal from the woods directly towards the long|boat, probably with an intention to cut off our retreat, and to ma&s;&s;acre every one of us without mercy. Tho&s;e of our people who had been oc|cupied in lighting a fire at &s;ome di&s;tance, perceiv|ed their intention fir&s;t, and appri&s;ed us of it by a &s;ignal. I rai&s;ed my eyes, and &s;aw forty or fifty more Indians flying towards us from another &s;ide. Our &s;ituation was de&s;perate; however, I animated my people to be faint-hearted. "They are naked wretches," &s;aid I; "let us fight them in the plain, and I will pledge my word we will &s;oon make them run away as fa&s;t as they came." However, I had reckoned without my ho&s;t. They grew more numerous every moment. Mo&s;t of them were armed with a &s;hield, and had a &s;hort &s;word in the right hand.</P>
<P>"Let us retreat to the boat! exclaimed I, when I &s;aw this; for it would have been madne&s;s, if our &s;mall defencele&s;s troop had attempted to en|gage immen&s;e numbers, a grain of &s;and again&s;t a billow of the &s;ea. We ran as fa&s;t as we could towards the long-boat, and tho&s;e who could not run fa&s;t enough, plunged into the river and &s;wam on board. The enemy was clo&s;e at our heels.</P>
<P>"We were, unfortunately, not prepared for a &s;udden departure, having &s;pread all our &s;ails over the boat, in the form of a tent. What &s;hould we do? One part of us made all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;te to &s;et the ve&s;&s;el afloat, whil&s;t the re&s;t defended them|&s;elves with the two hatchets and the &s;word, as well as they could. But what did our re&s;i&s;tance

avail? The hindmo&s;t were pierced by the za|gavas (a kind of lances with hooks) of the blacks.</P>
<P>"The &s;hip's baker, a &s;tout gigantic fellow, handled the &s;word with great dexterity, and made a dreadful havock among the blacks. I ordered the cable to be cut, and we now rowed away as fa&s;t as our con&s;ternation would permit. The &s;a|vages pur&s;ued us into the water, but &s;oon lo&s;t ground, and were obliged to abandon their prey. We did all that lay in our power, to pick up our unfortunate companions, who were &s;wimming in the river. Tho&s;e that were not mortally wound|ed, came &s;afely on board, a land breeze came to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and wafted our ve&s;&s;el over the &s;and banks, through the rocks and the foaming &s;urge.</P>
<P>"Our enemies had expected that our ve&s;&s;el would be da&s;hed to pieces again&s;t the rocks, and had run to the outermo&s;t point of the cape; how|ever, they were di&s;appointed in their expectation. We waved our hats, &s;et up a loud &s;hout, and &s;ail|ed away with a bri&s;k breeze.</P>
<P>I examined the wound of the brave baker, as &s;oon as we were out of danger and perceived that it had been inflicted with a poi&s;oned lance. It was above the navel, and the &s;urrounding parts had already turned black. I began to cut out large pieces of fle&s;h, to prevent the poi&s;on from &s;preading farther, but the pains which the poor fellow &s;uffered, were to no purpo&s;e; he dropt down dead at my feet, and we committed his body to the waves.</P>
<P>"I counted my companions, and found that &s;ixteen were mi&s;&s;ing, eleven having been killed on &s;hore. The fate of our four companions, whom I had left in the hamlet, was unknown to us; however, we had the greate&s;t rea&s;on to ap|prehend that they had become the fir&s;t victims of our ferocious enemies.</P>

<P>"After we had appea&s;ed the cravings of hun|ger, we filled our pockets with oy&s;ters and mu&s;|cles, repleni&s;hed our ca&s;ks with water, and went again on board.</P>
<P>"I propo&s;ed to my companions to &s;teer far|ther into the middle of the &s;ea, in order to be able to make more way in a &s;horter time. They followed my advice; but what was the con&s;e|quence? A dreadful tempe&s;t overtook us at night and to&s;&s;ed us about in a mo&s;t unmerciful manner. We apprehended every moment to be buried by the mountainous waves, but neverthele&s;s rejoiced at having altered our cour&s;e. Had we continued to &s;ail along the coa&s;t, the tempe&s;t would, un|doubtedly, have da&s;hed us again&s;t a rock, or we &s;hould have been compelled to land in the neare&s;t bay, the inhabitants of which, as we afterwards learned, were &s;worn enemies to the Dutch, and per&s;ecuted them with fire and &s;word.</P>
<P>"The tempe&s;t abated at day-break, and we per|ceived three i&s;lands which lay clo&s;e before us. We re&s;olved to go on &s;hore, becau&s;e we expected to find &s;ome nouri&s;hment, though they &s;eemed to be uninhabited. We &s;haped our cour&s;e to
<PB N="78" REF="037761_0232_100F064784C91518">
that which was neare&s;t, and found that it was en|tirely overgrown with bamboo as thick as a man's leg. Nece&s;&s;ity teaches us to turn almo&s;t any thing to advantage. We excavated a great number of the thicke&s;t bamboos from top to bottom, filled them with water and clo&s;ed them carefully. Thus we had multiplied our two water ca&s;ks. We al&s;o found palm trees on the i&s;land, the fruit of which &s;erved to appea&s;e our hunger. But this was the only &s;ort of provi&s;ions which we could find. We roved the whole i&s;land in every direction, how|ever could find nothing but palm trees and bam|boos.</P>
<P>"The next morning, at &s;un ri&s;e, I climbed up to the top of a high mountain which lay before us, having a &s;ecret pre&s;entiment that I &s;hould make an important di&s;covery. I &s;tood there and gazed a good while to no purpo&s;e; my looks wan|dered over the immen&s;e creation of God. Hav|ing gazed till my eyes ached, I thought I per|ceived two high blue mountains at a very great di&s;tance. I recollected that Hans van Shouten, my former ma&s;ter, God ble&s;s him, who had been twice in the Ea&s;t-Indies, had told me frequently that two high mountains were on the i&s;land of Ja|va, which &s;eemed to be blue at a certain di&s;tance. I concluded further: we came to this i&s;land when we had the coa&s;t of Sumatra to our le&s;t, the&s;e mountains are to the right, my eyes rove through the &s;pace which is between them, without de&s;cry|ing land; there is a &s;trait between Sumatra and Java&mdash;hurray! we are on the right tract!</P>
<P>"I &s;kipt down the mountain as &s;wift as a doe to call Van Hoorn, and to communicate my di&s;|covery to him; however, the clouds had conceal|ed the blue mountains before we could reach the &s;pot from whence I had &s;een them. Yet I was certain of their exi&s;tence as I had clearly &s;een
<PB N="79" REF="037761_0233_100F064992E7D418">
them. Van Hoorn agreed that my conjecture was not improbable, and we went down again to inform our companions of it.</P>
<P>"The joy of our people cannot be de&s;cribed, they &s;ung and danced as they carried dates and bamboos filled with water into the boat. The wind was favourable; we weighed anchor and di|rected our cour&s;e towards the blue mountains.</P>
<P>"We &s;aw a fire at midnight, and thought a long time that it proceeded from a &s;hip; however, it was on an i&s;land which lays in the entrance of the &s;trait. We had &s;carcely pa&s;&s;ed it, when we per|ceived again fire on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, and found that it was burning in a fi&s;hing boat. We were becalmed towards day-break; however&mdash;thank God! we were already near the coa&s;t of Java with|out knowing it.</P>
<P>"A &s;ailor who had climbed up the ma&s;t, ex|claimed &s;uddenly that he &s;aw a fleet, and counted three and twenty &s;hips. Our joy was greater than words can expre&s;s; we danced, &s;ung, and embra|ced each other with tears. We &s;teered towards the fleet as &s;oon as a &s;light breeze got up. Hea|venly Providence! (Ortenberg pulled his hat off, and a tear gli&s;tened in his eyes) it was a Dutch fleet, and we threw our&s;elves into the arms of our countrymen and friends.</P>
<P>"The Admiral, Van Ternaer, was ju&s;t &s;tand|ing in the gallery with a &s;pying-gla&s;s, and being &s;truck by the &s;ingularity of our &s;ails and appear|ance, &s;ent his boat to meet us. Good God! the people who were in it were acquaintances of our's; we had &s;ailed together from the Texel, and after|wards were &s;eparated.</P>
<P>"They took me and Van Hoorn into the boat and brought us on board of the Admiral's &s;hip. All the &s;ailors gazed at us with a&s;toni&s;hment, and Van Ternaer received us like brothers. It &s;hould

&s;eem that he perceived by our looks that we were hungry; for he ordered the cloth to be laid in|&s;tantly and &s;at down with us to dinner. Good God! how was I affected when I &s;aw bread a|gain! my heart was &s;traitened, the tears &s;tarted from my eyes, and I was not able to &s;wallow a mor&s;el for &s;ome time. The re&s;t of our people joined us &s;oon after, and were divided among&s;t the &s;hips.</P>

<P>"ALL this was very well," continued the hone&s;t tar: but what was I now to do to get a livelihood? My romantic ideas had been correct|ed pretty well, my de&s;ire for adventures had aba|ted, and, now I began to a&s;k my&s;elf where I &s;hould get bread?</P>
<P>"We arrived at Batavia; the people crowded around my&s;elf and my companions, &s;tared at us, li&s;tened to us with open mouths, and &s;huddered at our tale; however that was all. Not one of them thought of covering our nakedne&s;s or appea&s;ing our hunger; and I confe&s;s I rather would have &s;tarved than &s;olicited alms.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="037761_0235_100F064E4A6A7930">
"I had, fortunately, applied clo&s;ely to draw|ing in my youth, and now could ea&s;ily delineate &s;omething upon a piece of parchment which look|ed like a human figure. I drew a great number of &s;uch figures as my imagination &s;ugge&s;ted. Some with hats and &s;ome with turbans, and &s;old them for Roman and Turki&s;h emperors. I ro|ved in this mi&s;erable manner from one town to the other, vi&s;ited Balambuan, Panarucan, Tuban, and came, at la&s;t, to Bantam in the bay of Ja|catra.</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t know that Bantam is a con&s;iderable place where an exten&s;ive trade is carried on. You can &s;ee there at nine o'clock in the morning, people of almo&s;t all nations a&s;&s;embled in the mar|ket place; Portugue&s;e, Arabs, Turks, Malayes, Aby&s;&s;inians, Chine&s;e, Peguans, Bengales, Guzu|rates, and Malabares. One might think it Hea|ven where people of all nations are to meet. You will &s;ee there no u&s;ele&s;s di&s;putes about be|lief or unbelief, for every one &s;erves God in his own way and makes no words, as it ought to be.</P>
<P>While I was &s;tanding there and gaping at the motley a&s;&s;emblage, and watching for an opportu|nity to earn a mor&s;el of bread, I heard &s;uddenly &s;ome per&s;on behind me &s;peak German. I thought it mu&s;ic from another world. My head turned mechanically towards the &s;pot whence the grate|ful &s;ounds proceeded, and I perceived a man of a middle age, with an open countenance, which in&s;pired confidence, di&s;cour&s;ing with another man, who, as I afterwards learned, was a Hambro' Cap|tain.</P>
<P>When they had fini&s;hed their conver&s;ation, and the Hamburger had left him, I took courage, went up to the man with the good natured countenance, and &s;aid: "Sir, I am a poor German, a country|man of yours. Your countenance tells me that
<PB N="82" REF="037761_0236_100F064FD6AD7738">
you are an hone&s;t man; I conjure you to do a cha|ritable deed, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t a &s;hipwrecked wretch who has lo&s;t all his property. I wi&s;h to get my bread by the labour of my hands, but have no op|portunity of getting an honourable livelihood; for no one has confidence in a naked fellow, but I neither &s;hould like to beg, nor could do it.</P>
<P>"The man &s;urveyed me from top to toe.</P>
<P>"Welcome! countryman!" &s;aid he at la&s;t: "I rejoice to do a work of charity. I do not want your &s;ervices, but will a&s;&s;i&s;t you as well as I can."</P>
<P>"He then took me to his hou&s;e, gave me to eat and to drink, and ab&s;tained from all trouble|&s;ome que&s;tions, till I had appea&s;ed my hunger. But when I had fini&s;hed my meal, he began to examine me, and to enquire from what place I came. I gave him a faithful account of my ad|ventures, and informed him without re&s;erve of the follies I had committed. I thought it better to confe&s;s my errors than to conceal them; for, we are all poor &s;inners, and lock up or di&s;&s;ipate the talent which the great trea&s;urer in Heaven has lent us, to pay for our entrance into the next world. My frankne&s;s gained the heart of the worthy German.</P>
<P>"Mr. Ortenberg," &s;aid he to me: "you are an hone&s;t man. The grief which you have cau&s;|ed to your aged father, was early puni&s;hed by Providence with trouble and affliction. You now have had an opportunity of coming to a proper &s;en&s;e; I dare &s;ay you have di&s;carded your roman|tic notions, and beg you will ponder the propo&s;al which I am going to make to you. I am a native of Thuringia; my name is Chri&s;tian Shwarz I have liv|ed twenty years on this i&s;land; God has pro&s;pered my diligence, and I am a rich man. My dome&s;|tics love me and I enjoy the e&s;teem of my fellow-citizens. However, what are love, regard, and wealth, if we cannot enjoy them at the &s;pot where
<PB N="83" REF="037761_0237_100F0651D76B8F48">
we were born, if the companions of our juvenile days with whom we grew up, do not &s;ee and &s;hare our pro&s;perity? The voice of my native country calls loudly in my bo&s;om; I have &s;old all my plan|tations, and am going to return in a few weeks on board of a Hambro' ve&s;&s;el to my dear Germany. If you will keep me company, I will defray the expen|ces of your voyage, and re&s;tore you to the arms of your father, who will receive you joyfully.</P>
<P>"This was, indeed, a good and &s;en&s;ible pro|po&s;al, and came from a worthy and hone&s;t man; but was it po&s;&s;ible I could have accepted it? No, indeed, not! No, &s;aid I, I cannot accept your generous offer; God knows, I cannot. I mu&s;t fir&s;t endeavour to become a man of whom my fa|ther needs not to be a&s;hamed. It would kill me were I obliged to return to my parents as a beg|gar. Let the con&s;equences be what they may; I &s;hall not return to my native country in <HI>this</HI> &s;tate."</P>
<P>"The kind remon&s;trances of hone&s;t Chri&s;tian Shwarz were thrown away upon me. I could not bear to think that my town&s;men &s;hould point at me in the &s;treets, and whi&s;per: "There goes that fool who dreamed of finding golden moun|tains in the Indies, and now is glad to be permit|ted to put his feet again under his fathers table. What a &s;courge is that good for nothing fellow to his parents!" No, I rather would be the &s;lave of a Malay, rather moi&s;ten the &s;ugar plantations with my &s;weat, than become a laughing &s;tock to my town&s;men.</P>
<P>"When the hone&s;t Thuringian &s;aw that he could not per&s;uade me to return to my native country, he counted down&mdash;it &s;ounds fabulous, but God knows he did&mdash;he counted down a thou|&s;and ponnes in gold and &s;ilver fannons.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">About 625 pounds &s;terling.</NOTE> "Take
<PB N="84" REF="037761_0238_100F06545AFC5340">
this money," &s;aid he in a tone as if he had given me a gla&s;s of water; "and do not thank me. I am a rich man, and returning to my country with trea&s;ures which would enable me to buy a princi|pality, if I were a lover of principalities. I in|tended to make, previous to my departure, a pre|&s;ent of a gold calix, a rich covering for the altar, and the like to the Dutch chapel. Man believes frequently that he can pay his debts to God by &s;uch non&s;en&s;ical gifts; however, I think it is much better to a&s;&s;i&s;t a worthy &s;ufferer with the &s;um which was de&s;igned for that purpo&s;e. This is more acceptable to God than a gold calix. Take it my friend, and go with your money to the coa&s;t of Coromandel, where you will find a thou&s;and times more opportunities of making a fortune than here. I wi&s;h you a happy journey. Forget not to pay a vi&s;it to old Chri&s;tian Shwarz, when you once come back again to Germany.</P>
<P>Oh, my friends, &s;eventeen years are now elap&s;|ed &s;ince Chri&s;tian Shwarz left the Indies. I &s;till think I &s;ee him in the harbour of Bantam, where he went on board of the Hambro' ve&s;&s;el; I &s;till imagine that I feel the la&s;t hone&s;t &s;hake of his hand, and to hear him call to me from deck:</P>
<P>"Farewell, Ortenberg! and when you return to Germany, forget not to &s;pend a few days in the town of Wernigerode!"</P>
<P>"The &s;hip got under &s;ail, and in a &s;hort time was borne from my view by a ri&s;ing gale. I &s;tood on the pier, and wept till &s;un-&s;et, and &s;lept very little that night. But let us proceed!</P>
<P>"I now had a thou&s;and ponnes in my pocket. My benefactor had enjoined me not to &s;tay at Java, and I had be&s;ides, no inclination to remain there. I hired a place in a jonke which was to carry pine apples to the continent (for you mu&s;t know that Java produces the be&s;t ananas in the
<PB N="85" REF="037761_0239_100F0656771958C0">
Indies). I pa&s;&s;ed Sumatra and came into the bay of Siam, whence I proceeded, after a &s;hort &s;tay, to Ceylon, I went from the latter i&s;land to the coa&s;t of Coromandel, vi&s;ited Negapatnam, Kari|kal, Pondicherry, Madras, Ma&s;ulipatnam, and thus approached gradually the gulf of Bengal.</P>
<P>"I was &s;till irre&s;olute how I &s;hould lay out my thou&s;and ponnes, whether I &s;hould traffic with pep|per, ging<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ms, or printed callico.</P>
<P>"One day I happened to take a &s;olitary walk into the woods near Bengal, mu&s;ing on my ho|ne&s;t father, my old mother, and my native place. A &s;weet melancholy &s;tole by degrees upon my mind. The delightful notes of the chaffinch of Bengal, the plaintive &s;ong of the Bulbul, the wild accents of the Buzzard, the chirping of the little Quail of Gingi, and the harmonious &s;ong of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;ted lark of Malabar, produced &s;trange and in|voluntary &s;en&s;ations in my heart. I wiped many a melancholy tear from my cheeks. My imagi|nation roved over the immen&s;e ocean to my country and the place of my nativity, where I had inhaled my fir&s;t breath, and recalled to my mind tho&s;e bli&s;sful days of childi&s;h innocence, when the pond on the margin of which I was went to play, appeared to me larger than the &s;ea which now lay before me; when Bre&s;lau &s;eemed to me to be a world, and when I hung with gazing eyes on the lips of my father, while he related after &s;upper, accounts of the fabulous Indies and their a&s;toni&s;hing trea&s;ures.</P>
<P>"Alas! I would have given all the gold of the Nabobs in that moment, if I could have filled the tobacco pipe for my father, &s;at down by his &s;ide on the &s;traw &s;tool which u&s;ed to &s;tand in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> behind the &s;tove, and hear him de&s;cribe only what now was before my eyes. I &s;till fancy to hear my hone&s;t old father relate his artle&s;s
<PB N="86" REF="037761_0240_100F0658A4FFE4B0">
tales, which he kindly adapted to my childi&s;h ca|pacity, till the clock which &s;tood in the right cor|ner of the parlour &s;truck t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n, when he emptied his pipe, pouring his la&s;t drop of beer on the em|bers, offered me his hand to ki&s;s it, took the key of the &s;treet door from the table, and retired to his bed chamber."</P>
<P>Here hone&s;t Ortenberg was deeply affected&mdash;and attempted &s;everal times in vain to &s;peak.</P>
<P>"I can dwell no longer on this &s;ubject," &s;tam|mered he at length, while a big tear gli&s;tened in his eyes: Friend Spiller you knew him!"</P>
<P>A &s;olemn pau&s;e. All were powerfully affect|ed. "Good old father!" exclaimed Ortenberg, rai&s;ing his eyes and hands to Heaven: "you have forgiven me my follies; I am &s;ure you have; and when we meet again, wherever it be, you will receive me with that cordial &s;hake of the hand with which you bade me farewell; will call to me: "Welcome my &s;on;" with the &s;ame kind and paternal voice with which you &s;aid: "God ble&s;s you my &s;on!" yes I am &s;ure, you will!&mdash;and now&mdash;children, continued he, while he dried his eyes, don't mention a word more about my fa|ther, if you wi&s;h that I &s;hould reli&s;h my gla&s;s of wine."</P>
<P>Another pau&s;e. Ortenberg had collected him|&s;elf. "I was taking a walk, as I told you, and unexpectedly found my&s;elf bewildered in the wood. I knew not which way I &s;hould turn. While I con&s;ulted with my&s;elf which direction I &s;hould take, I heard &s;uddenly a murmuring of water, and perceived that I was near a rill: I was dry and proceeded towards it, when I was dry and proceeded towards it, when I was met by a girl of uncommon beauty, carrying a pitcher with water. Her taper form was wrapt in a piece of chintz, an apron made of the wool of the &s;heep of Tibet, floated from her wai&s;t, and
<PB N="87" REF="037761_0241_100F065B51CE26B8">
twelve gold rings were fa&s;tened round her arms and above her ancles. The palm of her hand was tinged with the ro&s;eat juice of mindi leaves, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;tre of her eyes was &s;et off by a black &s;emi|circle. Gold and &s;ilver chains adorned her beau|tiful neck; her diamond ear-rings added little to the lu&s;tre of her charms: her hair was anointed with cocoa oil, and wreathed round a gold pin.</P>
<P>"She &s;urveyed me with apparent &s;atisfaction from head to toe, while &s;he pa&s;&s;ed me, &s;kipping lightly over the gra&s;s, and uncovered her &s;welling bo&s;om. The girl thought I, mu&s;t &s;urely be an harlot; but I was mi&s;taken; for I knew not that an unmarried Indian who has had a good educa|tion, is obliged to uncover her bo&s;om, when &s;he meets a per&s;on that belongs to one of the higher ca&s;ts, or an European.</P>
<P>"This is a civility which the fair ones of the Ea&s;t perform with as much unconcern as our ladies make a curt&s;ey; and to be plain, I confe&s;s that this cu&s;tom appears to me to be more con|&s;i&s;tent with propriety, than the curt&s;ies of our la|dies, which reduces a woman to a very aukward po&s;ture, that, indeed, does not &s;trike us, becau&s;e we are u&s;ed to it.</P>
<P>"The &s;welling bo&s;om of the fair Indian, which was not &s;queezed up by a cor&s;et, made me forget to quench my thir&s;t, and deaf to the harmonious &s;trains of the tufted lark of Malabar. I &s;topped, and the Indian followed my example. We look|ed at each other and &s;eemed to be mutually in|clined to enter into conver&s;ation. My European notions of propriety and impropriety prevented me from acco&s;ting her; but the beautiful child of nature, who was a &s;tranger to the burthen&s;ome prejudices of the We&s;tern hemi&s;phere, obeyed the dictates of her heart.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="037761_0242_100F065CD3F29528">
"Stranger, do you want to drink?" &s;aid &s;he, with a bewitching &s;weetne&s;s.</P>
<P>"Yes, &s;weet girl, I want to drink! replied I with a kind of voluptuous tremor.</P>
<P>"She came to me, offering her pitcher, and I drank. The cape-wine here is, indeed, not bad; however, I never reli&s;hed a liquor &s;o much as the water which I received from the hands of &s;miling innocence.</P>
<P>"I thank you, my pretty girl; &s;tammered I. "Who are you?</P>
<P>"I am Welli" replied &s;he: "the daughter of the pious Bramin Akbar, who lives not far from here in a Sholtre.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sholtre a building for the accommodation of weary travellers.</NOTE> Come with me; I will dre&s;s a di&s;h of cange<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Cange, boiled rice water.</NOTE> for you."</P>
<P>"Could I have done better than to accept the offer of the ho&s;pitable Welli? "I like you," &s;aid &s;he to me on the road: "do you like me too?"</P>
<P>"I &s;queezed her hand, a language which is un|der&s;took in all countries. I had a wai&s;tcoat with gla&s;s buttons on; Welli wi&s;hed to have one; I gave it to her, and &s;he pre&s;&s;ed me in return to ac|cept of a diamond ear-ring.</P>
<P>"Why don't you take it?" &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>"Becau&s;e it is worth ten times more than my gla&s;s button!</P>
<P>"It is fal&s;e," replied Welli; "your button is larger; I &s;hall have it &s;et in gold, and wear it on my finger.</P>
<P>"I was obliged to put the ear-ring in my pocket; for &s;he threatened to beat me.</P>
<P>"We at la&s;t arrived at the &s;holtre, which was not far di&s;tant from a pagoda, dedicated to the &s;er|vice of Wi&s;hnu. Her father, Akbar, a venerable
<PB N="89" REF="037761_0243_100F065EC78BFDD8">
old man who&s;e head was &s;haved, met us at the door. His dre&s;s con&s;i&s;ted of a piece of Calico which was wrapt round his wai&s;t; his &s;houlders were covered with the a&s;hes of cow-dung, and his forehead was marked with three &s;trokes made with &s;andal wood and &s;affron.</P>
<P>"Stranger, be welcome!" &s;aid he: walk in and &s;it down at the table of old Akbar, eat of his rice and drink of his cange.</P>
<P>"I accepted his invitation with plea&s;ure, becau&s;e I was as hungry as an Indian wild cat. The lovely Welli &s;kipped bu&s;ily to and fro, &s;troked my hair back every now and then, and played with my gla&s;s buttons. Evening was &s;etting in, it was too late for me to return to my lodgings; Akbar or|dered a couch to be prepared for me, upon which a &s;lept but very little, becau&s;e the image of the amiable Welli was con&s;tantly about me, near me, and within me; upon my &s;oul it was.</P>
<P>"The next morning I &s;aw old Akbar go to the rill; he took &s;ome water in the hollow of his hand, and &s;prinkled it before and behind him, and again&s;t the ri&s;ing &s;un. "Prai&s;ed be Brama!" exclaimed he three times, and then bathed him&s;elf. This ceremony, which is called <HI>Sandiwane,</HI> and is per|formed every morning, is, in my opinion, by far more rational than the fumigations of Europeans at the &s;hrines of their &s;aints.</P>
<P>"Welli now made her appearance; &s;he was dre&s;&s;ed with more care and &s;plendor than the pre|ceding day; the &s;emicircle over her eyes was blacker, the palm of her hand tinged with a deep|er hue, and I was vain enough to think &s;he done it on my account.</P>

<P>"When a lover, in the Indies wants to apply for the hand of his mi&s;tre&s;s, he takes thirty ponnes in his hand, goes to her father, and &s;ays: The gold is yours and the girl is mine!

<P>"Will you live with me? nur&s;e me in my old age? and &s;erve my God?</P>

<P>"If I am to be your father," replied Akbar, you mu&s;t comply with the manners and cu&s;toms of our country. There is but <HI>one</HI> religion in the world; the mortals of the whole globe bend their knees only before <HI>one</HI> God. However, the igno|rance of men has infinitely multiplied the manner of wor&s;hipping the Supreme Being, though it &s;hould be as &s;imple as po&s;&s;ible.

If you wi&s;h to obtain the hand of my good Welli, you mu&s;t dre&s;s your&s;elf like a Tamulian; I mu&s;t in&s;truct you two months in the language and cu&s;toms of my nation.

<P>"I agreed willingly to every condition that could in&s;ure me the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the charming Welli. The two months appeared indeed as long to me as if they had been years; however a kind look of my bride made me a docile pupil. Akbar frequently &s;urveyed me with &s;crutinizing looks; however my frank and open di&s;po&s;ition gained me his confidence.</P>
<P>I learned in a &s;hort time, to wa&s;h the Lingam, and to perform the Sandiwane, with as much dex|terity as if I had been brought up to it. The pro|bationary time was elap&s;ed, and&mdash;Welli became my wife.</P>
<P>"Akbar took me a&s;ide the next day and &s;aid, "Young man, I have entru&s;ted you with the greate&s;t trea&s;ure I po&s;&s;e&s;s; it is therefore ju&s;t I &s;hould put you al&s;o in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that which is of le&s;s value to me. Come and follow me!"</P>
<P>"We proceeded &s;ilently towards the neighbour|ing fore&s;t; the old man led the way and I followed him full of expectation. He conducted me by unbeaten paths through wild and intricate bu&s;hes, and &s;topt at length at the mouth of a cavern, which was covered with low &s;hrubs.</P>
<P>"We &s;tept into a cavern, I perceived the glim|mering of a &s;mall lamp at the bottom; my con|ductor bade me &s;top, fetching the lamp, and light|ing &s;everal more which hung in different parts of the cavern.</P>

"Heavens! what a &s;pectacle for a greedy Eu|ropean. Large heaps of gold and &s;ilver, diamonds and pearls lay before me. I was almo&s;t petrified. I had imagined my&s;elf to be rich, becau&s;e I had a thou&s;and ponnes in my pocket, and there lay a thou&s;and times thou&s;and pieces of gold, which bore the coinage of all trading nations.</P>
<P>"You are a&s;toni&s;hed," &s;aid Akbar: "this trea|&s;ure is indeed not the fruit of my diligence, how|ever, it al&s;o is, not the fruit of a crime. We Bramins are obliged to live entirely upon alms, with which the &s;uper&s;tition of the people provides us, &s;ometimes &s;paringly, and &s;ometimes, richly, according to the degree of their affection and re|gard. We are, &s;trange to tell, prohibited to work, the people pay us for our idlene&s;s, and I have been told this is al&s;o the cu&s;tom of your country.</P>
<P>"I have been a &s;ervant in the pagoda, from which we are coming during forty circumvolutions of the &s;un. I had a father&mdash;he went long &s;ince to the bli&s;sful habitations of Wi&s;hnu, who taught me early to walk the paths of wi&s;dom and vir|tue. He in&s;tructed me to compute the cour&s;e of the heavenly bodies, in the art of making alma|nacks, and in the knowledge of medical herbs and roots.</P>
<P>"All this gained me a name in the adjacent country, the people flocked to my pagoda, either to peep behind the curtain of Nature, or to be cured of di&s;ea&s;es; or only to gaze at me. None came with empty hands; the rich brought me diamonds and gold, and from the poor I took only a no&s;egay.</P>
<P>"Here is all the wealth which I have trea&s;ured up the&s;e forty years for my dear Welli, and now deliver to my dear &s;on-in-law. You mu&s;t, how|ever, promi&s;e me, neither to leave me, nor to

<P>"I complied with this reque&s;t. Akbar cla&s;ped me to his heart, extingui&s;hed the lamps, and re|turned to the pagoda&punc; There I &s;pent the happie&s;t days of my life in the arms of my dear Welli, and by the &s;ide of that excellent old man, and learnt to e&s;timate men by their intrin&s;ic worth, and not by the forms of prayer which they frequently utter mechanically, without meaning any thing by it. We had no occa&s;ion for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he trea&s;ure in the cavern; we wanted little, and had a trea&s;ure within our|&s;elves more precious than all the wealth of the Indies. Yes, my friends, I have learnt that con|fidence in the goodne&s;s and wi&s;dom of God, cheerful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his paternal decrees, obedi|ence to his holy laws, moderation of our pa&s;&s;ions, purity and good-will towards mankind, enable us to be &s;atisfied with little to in&s;ure happine&s;s in this world, and to meet futurity without trembling.</P>
<P>"I meditated frequently to &s;end a part of our u&s;ele&s;s wealth to my old father, but did not know how to accompli&s;h my de&s;ign. I could have ap|plied to a Dutch merchant of Ma&s;ulipatnam, how|ever Akbar oppo&s;ed his whole paternal authority to the execution of this plan, becau&s;e he knew better than my&s;elf how much this would have ex|po&s;ed me to the fanatic per&s;ecutions of the Euro|pean mi&s;&s;ionaries, to whom I might have been be|trayed.</P>

<P>"I was obliged to &s;ubmit, and &s;ubmitted with|out reluctance, for Welli loved her father with an un&s;peakable ardour. The fatal hour in which the

<P>"This was a melancholy day. Welli tore her hair, &s;mote her brea&s;t, and rolled her&s;elf on the ground. All this is cu&s;tomary in the Indies; however, <HI>her</HI> agony was &s;omething more than the mere effect of cu&s;tom. A crowd of women flock|ed to the pagoda, as &s;oon as Akbar's death was known, and &s;ung mournful dirges. I cannot ex|pre&s;s how this affected me. The Bramins perform|ed various rites, and at la&s;t laid the corp&s;e upon a palankin, adorned with flowers, and preceded by two men, with a kind of wind in&s;truments, which cau&s;ed a mo&s;t di&s;mal &s;ound, and a great number of muffled drums. I &s;upported my Welli; we fol|lowed the palankin with tearful eyes. When we came to the pile, which had been erected of San|dal wood, I was de&s;ired to &s;et fire to it, becau&s;e I was regarded as the head of the family; a melan|choly duty, which I performed with a bleeding heart.</P>
<P>"Welli dropped fainting on the ground when the flame blazed aloft. I took her in my arms, and carried her home. We &s;pent &s;everal gloomy months, &s;haved our heads, and covered our faces, according to the cu&s;tom of the Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>"The healing bal&s;am of time re&s;tored at la&s;t, part of our lo&s;t tranquillity to us; however, neither I nor Welli wi&s;hed to &s;tay any longer at that melan|choly &s;pot.

"God, thou ha&s;t made me empty the bittere&s;t cup of affliction! all other &s;ufferings which thou perhaps ha&s;t re&s;erved for me, will certainly be trifling in compari&s;on with that un&s;peakably painful blow! our mo&s;t ardent wi&s;hes were accompli&s;hed&mdash;Welli was pregnant&mdash;but, alas! oh weep with me, my friends, and let me not weep alone!&mdash;&s;he was &s;o good, &s;o gentle, and &s;o loving&mdash;oh! oh! let me not weep alone!</P>
<P>Ortenberg &s;hed a torrent of bitter tears; all wept with him; the&s;e were ob&s;equies more valu|able than any of tho&s;e can be that are performed in honour of the gods on earth. He recollected him&s;elf again at la&s;t, after a long and painful &s;truggle "My friends," re&s;umed he, "you now know my &s;tory.

<P>Having &s;aid this, he ro&s;e, emptied his pipe, and begged to be &s;hewn to his bed-room. The wife of his venerable ho&s;t had prepared her bridal bed for him. It was covered with a &s;ilk quilt, which was embroidered with a great variety of flowers, and provided with chintz curtains, to keep off the rays of the morning &s;un. U&s;ele&s;s preparations! Ortenberg never &s;lept in a bed. "I am always terrified," &s;aid he, "when I &s;ink all at once into a &s;ea of feathers, and the bed billows join over me; my bo&s;om is &s;traitened, and I cannot &s;leep." His negroes &s;pread a couple of blankets upon the floor&punc; laid a pillow upon them, and his couch was ready.</P>

He awoke in the morning with the fir&s;t dawn of day and got up. Impatience and joyful ex|pectation would not let him &s;leep, and whenever he clo&s;ed his eyes, he dreamed of Chi&s;tian Shwarz, and his imagination anticipated the raptures of &s;urpri&s;e which his &s;udden appearance would cau&s;e his benefactor, and the plea&s;ure which the com|munication of his adventures would give him.</P>
<P>He ordered the carriage to be got ready, and took leave of his venerable ho&s;t. "Farewell, my worthy friend," &s;aid he: "my heart urges me to be gone without further delay. I &s;hall re|turn to you as &s;oon as I &s;hall have done chatting with my dear Chri&s;tian Shwarz. I then &s;hall con|&s;ider more maturely, what is to be done concern|ing this boy; for I cannot do it now, becau&s;e my imagination is too much occupied by other ob|jects, which ab&s;orb all my faculties of thinking!" He got into the carriage and arrived two days af|ter at the town of Wernigerode in the Harz.</P>
<P>When he came to the turnpike, a drunken gate keeper a&s;ked him who he was, and whence he came? Ortenberg informed him of both, under the condition that he al&s;o &s;hould &s;atisfy his curio|&s;ity, and tell him whether Chri&s;tian Shwarz lived in the town and was well?</P>
<P>"Chri&s;t&mdash;&s;han&mdash;Shwa&mdash;Shwarz?" &s;tammered the gate-keeper: "he has given the &s;lip to his phy&s;ician and is well."</P>
<P>"I am glad of it, replied Ortenberg, and order|ed the po&s;tillion to go on. When he turned round the corner of a &s;treet, he met a funeral proce&s;&s;ion. "My friend &s;aid he to one of his gaping &s;pectators: "can you tell me where Chri&s;|tian Shwarz re&s;ides?"</P>

your coffin! &s;hall I not be able to thank you be|fore we meet in a better world?</P>
<P>A torrent of tears gu&s;hed down his &s;un burnt cheeks; he jumped out of his carriage and mix|ed with the mourners. No black crape be&s;poke his grief; however, the copious &s;treams of tears which &s;tarted from his eyes, the &s;ilent agony which his features expre&s;&s;ed, di&s;played &s;ufficient|ly the &s;orrows that convul&s;ed his bleeding heart.&mdash;All gazed at the &s;tranger&mdash;"You are a&s;to|ni&s;hed at the violence of my grief?" exclaimed Ortenberg in mournful accents: "alas! he gave me a thou&s;and ponnes when I was naked and &s;tarving."</P>
<P>The hone&s;t citizens of Wernigerode who knew not what a ponnes is, thought his intellects were deranged. One of the attending clergymen went up to him a&s;king him; whether he had known the decea&s;ed?</P>
<P>"Yes, I knew him!" groaned Ortenberg: I knew him, indeed! he gave me a thou&s;and pon|nes when I had not a <HI>kauri</HI> in my pocket."</P>
<P>The clergyman who contrary to the cu&s;tom of his colleagues, knew &s;omething more than to di&s;|pen&s;e the benediction and to rail again&s;t heretics and infidels, recollected to have read that <HI>kauris</HI> are a kind of little &s;hells which &s;erve in&s;tead of &s;mall ca&s;h on the coa&s;t of Coromandel and Ma|labar.

<P>"How! What! exclaimed Ortenberg: "ex|cu&s;e my frankne&s;s; this is fal&s;e; indeed it is. I am happy to hear that Chri&s;tian Shwarz has left a wife and children&mdash;but in di&s;tre&s;s!&mdash;no, that can|not be.

<P>He was, indeed; all his fellow-ci|tizens can witne&s;s it. He returned to his coun|try with an immen&s;e fortune; however, repeated misfortunes can exhau&s;t the greate&s;t wealth. He built a magnificent hou&s;e, and it was de&s;troyed by fire; he bought an e&s;tate, and it was totally ruin|ed by hail, inundations, a con&s;tant failure of his crops, and epidemic di&s;ea&s;es among the cattle; he e&s;tabli&s;hed a manufactory, and government threw numberle&s;s impediments in his way; he engaged in trade, and his corre&s;pondents failed.</P>
<P>He had ju&s;t as much left as would have enabled him to live comfortably with his family, when he tru&s;ted too much to a fal&s;e friend, becoming &s;ecu|rity for him to a large amount, and was cheated. He was forced to turn all his property into mo|ney, in order to e&s;cape a di&s;graceful confinement. This la&s;t &s;evere blow co&s;t him, probably, his life.</P>
<P>"Oh God! oh God! exclaimed Ortenberg, wringing his hands: "is this the reward of pro|bity! who could blame the hone&s;t who murmurs again&s;t providence? Why mu&s;t virtue be per&s;e|cuted every where by knaves?"</P>

<P>They had arrived at the church-yard during this conver&s;ation. Ortenberg reque&s;ted the favour of having the coffin opened once more, as he ardently wi&s;hed to ki&s;s the cold hand of his benefactor; however, the cu&s;tom of the town did not permit it. The common people imagined this would di&s;turb the re&s;t of the dead, and would have &s;toned the per&s;on that &s;hould have attempted it, the coffin was therefore committed to the ground, and Or|tenberg moi&s;tened the earth which was thrown upon it, with his tears.</P>
<P>After the officiating clergyman had pronounced the benediction, Ortenberg di&s;tributed all the money he had with him among the poor.</P>
<P>"I don't give it to you" &s;aid he: "to pray for the peace of the decea&s;ed; he does not want your prayers! but weep with me! I prefer your tears to your thanks."</P>
<P>It was an affecting &s;pectacle. Ortenberg had &s;eated him&s;elf upon the fre&s;h grave, and taking up a handful of earth contemplating it with &s;ilent grief. The hone&s;t Wernigeroders &s;tood around him, ga|zing at him, and knowing not what to think of him.</P>
<P>"Enough! enough! exclaimed he at la&s;t; "his children are yet alive, let us be gone to the widow of hone&s;t Chri&s;tian Shwarz."</P>
<P>He ro&s;e, took the clergyman by the hand, and reque&s;ted him to go with him to the widow of the decea&s;ed. They found the poor woman &s;wimming
<PB N="103" REF="037761_0257_100F0677AAD23050">
in tears, and &s;urrounded by three boys half naked, the elde&s;t of whom was about &s;even years old.</P>
<P>"Excu&s;e me, madam!" &s;aid Ortenberg when he &s;tept into the apartment: I do not intend to con|&s;ole you, no, I wi&s;h to mingle my tears with yours."</P>
<P>He was as good as his word; for he had &s;carce|ly &s;aid this when a torrent of tears gu&s;hed from his eyes, which he &s;uffered to flow freely. The picture of the decea&s;ed painted by <HI>Graf,</HI> an excellent like|ne&s;s, hung oppo&s;ite him; his eyes caught it; "Yes, this is he!" exclaimed he &s;obbing: "thus he looked when he embarked for Germany, and took leave of me! Alas! he has gone on a greater jour|ney without taking leave of me."</P>
<P>The clergyman told the a&s;toni&s;hed widow the gentleman was an old friend of her hu&s;band and had known him in India.</P>
<P>"Friend! exclaimed Ortenberg: "he was more than a friend to me! he was a benefactor, a father! I am his debtor! I owe him more than I &s;hall be able to repay in this world. Permit, me, Madam&mdash;boys (calling for his blacks)! bring my trunks hither!" The blacks obeyed. He unlocked it, and taking a leather pur&s;e out, counted 1000 ducats upon the table.</P>
<P>"Here, madam, take it. The&s;e are the thou&s;and ponnes which your hu&s;band advanced me when I arrived half naked and half fami&s;hed at Bantam. God will pay him the intere&s;t! Sir (turning to the clergyman), I can &s;pare no more at pre&s;ent; how|ever, I take you to witne&s;s that I engage to &s;end to this good lady the widow of my benefactor, within four weeks, <HI>ten</HI> times as much. I am not u&s;ed to give bonds; my word is my bond, and you can rely upon it. I &s;hould, be&s;ides, wi&s;h to erect a monument upon the grave of my hone&s;t Chri&s;tian Shwarz, and &s;hall &s;end you 500 ducats for that

purpo&s;e. Let it be done after your own ideas; but let the in&s;cription be as &s;imple as po&s;&s;ible. My name mu&s;t not be mentioned; for I want to erect a monument for <HI>him</HI> and not for my&s;elf."</P>
<P>The good people thought all was a dream; the widow was going to throw her&s;elf with her chil|dren at Ortenberg's feet; however, he was almo&s;t provoked at it. "I only have done my duty, and nothing el&s;e," &s;aid he: "I &s;hould not de&s;erve to live if I could &s;uffer the widow and children of my benefactor to langui&s;h in di&s;tre&s;s. No, no, while I have a mor&s;el to eat, one half of it &s;hall be yours."</P>
<P>The fir&s;t violent &s;en&s;ation of grief yielded gra|dually to the milder feelings of melancholy e|motion. They began to conver&s;e more connect|edly, di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the future dome&s;tic regulations of the widow, and con&s;ulted about the education of her children.</P>

<P>WHAT I have to tell you, kind reader in this chapter, is but very little, for our hone&s;t Nicolaus Ortenberg does not wi&s;h that his good actions &s;hould be talked of too loudly. He returned to his nephew, &s;ettled a large &s;um upon the &s;ons of the good clergyman, to enable them to pro&s;ecute their academic career with ea&s;e; he cau&s;ed a neat hou&s;e to be built for old Conrad, which was pro|vided with all comforts of life, and added a &s;mall capital, to enable the hone&s;t fellow to clo&s;e his life in tranquillity and ea&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="037761_0260_100F067EC8917370">
Barbara, who &s;till thought &s;he felt the &s;pittle of the blacks on her wrinkled cheeks, was not &s;atis|fied with the bounty of the generous Ortenberg, and cen&s;ured every thing he did for her and her hu&s;band's comfort. Ortenberg propo&s;ed there|fore to old Conrad, to &s;end her to the hou&s;e of correction, and thus to put it out of her power to poi&s;on his dome&s;tic peace. However&mdash;oh, pow|er of cu&s;tom!&mdash;the &s;colding Barbara had become nece&s;&s;ary to old Conrad, he cared very little for her &s;colding, nay, even thought he wanted &s;ome|thing when he heard not every day her &s;hrill voice re&s;ounding in the hou&s;e and kitchen. "Then keep her in the name of God!" &s;aid Ortenberg, the will of man is his heaven." They lived to|gether till Barbara at la&s;t was involved in &s;uch a violent quarrel with death, as to be choaked with pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Ortenberg adverti&s;ed in all the continental new&s;|papers; That if Charles Ortenberg, formerly head ma&s;ter of the grammar &s;chool of W**, &s;hould be &s;till alive, he was reque&s;ted to inform his brother Nicolaus and his &s;on of his abode."</P>
<P>However, this attempt was fruitle&s;s, and Ni|colaus u&s;ed him&s;elf gradually to the idea that he &s;hould not &s;ee his brother again on this &s;ide of the grave.</P>
<P>Nicolaus now formed a plan for his future life. He di&s;liked the monar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hic countries, becau&s;e even the be&s;t monarchies are not entirely untainted with de&s;poti&s;m. He re&s;olved therefore to &s;pend the re&s;t of his life in Switzerland.</P>
<P>Having &s;ettled every thing that concerned the future happine&s;s of his nephew, he retired to the Canton of Zurich, bought a large e&s;tate, &s;owed, planted, occupied him&s;elf with the breeding of cattle, and perceived that &s;atisfaction with which

<P>A well-cho&s;en library &s;hortened the long even|ings, and a familiar intercour&s;e with a few good and &s;ocial neighbours &s;weetened his &s;olitude.</P>
<P>William grew up in the mean time, nad made a good u&s;e of the in&s;tructions of the worthy cler|gyman, and now had &s;ufficiently improved to fre|quent an univer&s;ity with advantage. Attended by the ble&s;&s;ings of his uncle, the tears of old Con|rad, and the prayers of the venerable clergyman, he &s;et out for Gottingen, in his eighteenth year accompanied by the &s;ons of his in&s;tructor.</P>
<P>He commenced his new career with ardour, and pro&s;ecuted it with unexampled diligence. His head and heart did honour to his friends, and his &s;ober and &s;teady conduct gained him general re|gard.</P>

<P>WILLIAM wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> one day vi&s;ited by two of his fellow-&s;tudents, who, although &s;carcely eigh|teen years old, yet knew already that they were <HI>Counts of the holy Roman Empire,</HI> and almo&s;t knew nothing el&s;e but that. But as the German univer&s;ities are the abodes of liberty and equality, where the &s;on of a pea&s;ant enjoys the &s;ame pri|vileges which are granted to the &s;on of a prince; where di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s cements the bonds of friend&s;hip, and family pride is treated with ridi|cule; the&s;e two gentlemen had been obliged to renounce all claims to the difference which is ge|nerally attached to nobility of birth, and to learn the conver&s;ation of plebeians, that di&s;tinction is not every where attached to the &s;uperiority of rank which is founded merely upon the &s;trength of a piece of parchment. They betrayed their con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of their noble de&s;cent only at times,
<PB N="109" REF="037761_0263_100F0684D9C555F8">
and the words: <HI>His Excellency, my father, her Ladyship, my mother, our subjects,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c, were expre&s;&s;ions with which they frequently interlard|ed their di&s;cour&s;es.</P>
<P>But enough of a couple of de&s;picable beings whom accident has thrown into our way, and in who&s;e company I always &s;tay with reluctance, whether I meet them in the &s;treet or at the wri|ting de&s;k.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation with which they conde&s;cend|ed to entertain William, treated on pretty girls, hor&s;es, hounds, and cits whom they had taken in. Poor William felt the time very long while they were with him, gaped and frequently &s;tept to the window to re&s;pire.</P>
<P>Their inane di&s;cour&s;e was &s;uddenly interrupt|ed by an apparition. I may ju&s;tly call it an appa|rition; for the man who &s;tept into the apartment, having knocked repeatedly at the door, looked more like a &s;pectre than a human being. Imagine to your&s;elf an a&s;h-grey countenance, hollow eyes &s;haded by thick grey eye la&s;hes, pale and parched lips, a grey beard and hair of the &s;ame colour, holding in his &s;kinny hands a &s;tick, which &s;upport|ed his bending frame, dre&s;&s;ed in a black thread bare coat which could not cover his nakedne&s;s en|tirely. He &s;taggered &s;lowly and with tottering knees into the apartment; the burden of heavy &s;orrows &s;eemed to depre&s;s his frame more than the load of years. His hollow eyes di&s;played however, &s;till a faint &s;park of youthful vigour, and his face be&s;poke a kind of noble pride.</P>
<P>"Gentlemen," &s;aid he, excu&s;e my intruding upon you. I am a very poor man who wi&s;hes to die in his native country, and cannot &s;crape toge|ther as many pence as I have miles to walk."</P>
<P>What news from the moon, old gentleman?" began one of the counts: "you probably, are ju&s;t
<PB N="110" REF="037761_0264_100F068748DDAF10">
come thence, for I never &s;aw on our globe &s;uch a libel upon creation."</P>
<P>"I was mi&s;taken! replied the old man, groan|ing and ca&s;ting a look to Heaven which be&s;poke un&s;peakable bitterne&s;s: "forgive me for having interrupted your youthful mirth!"</P>
<P>Having uttered the&s;e words, he turned towards the door, and was going to quit the apartment; but William called after him in a compa&s;&s;ionate tone of voice.</P>
<P>"Venerable old man, &s;top a little you &s;hall not leave me without receiving &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance."</P>
<P>"You are right, William!" &s;aid the count: "It would be pity were we to &s;uffer old Saturn to pa&s;s beyond our horizon."</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>William.</SPEAKER>
<P>Count, be a&s;hamed! it is cruel to ri|dicule a poor old man, and I &s;hall not &s;uffer it in my apartment.</P>
<P>The old man had in the mean time, turned round again and ca&s;t a grateful look at the gene|rous youth. The count returned no an&s;wer, and William took a crown out of his pur&s;e.</P>
<P>The old man accidentally ca&s;t his eyes on a table which &s;tood only a few &s;teps di&s;tant from him. It ju&s;t happened to be po&s;t day. William had received a letter from his uncle and left the cover which was directed to him upon the ta|ble. The old man read:</P>
</SP>
<P>A Mon&s;ieur.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ieur Guillaume Ortenberg. He read it and fainted away.</P>
<P>"There you have it?" exclaimed the count: "this is the con&s;equence of meddling with beg|gars."</P>
<P>William deigned not to return an an&s;wer. He &s;lew to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the old man, &s;prinkled cold water in his face, chafed his temples with Hungary water, and at la&s;t &s;aw his humane en|deavours
<PB N="111" REF="037761_0265_100F0688CC096BC0">
crowned with &s;ucce&s;s. The old man opened his eyes again.</P>
<P>"Good young gentleman," &s;aid he, after having looked round a mom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nt, and recollecting the &s;i|tuation in which he had been: "God ble&s;s you for your humanity&mdash;God reward you for it&mdash;" He &s;eemed to wi&s;h to &s;ay more; however, a look which he ca&s;t at the count who had ju&s;t another wittici&s;m between his teeth, rendered him mute. William pre&s;&s;ed the crown in his hand, &s;aw him to the door, and patiently bore the railleries of the counts, who ridiculed him for the tear of &s;en|&s;ibility that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> from his eyes, and which he neither would nor could check.</P>
<P>William looked after the old man through the window, and &s;aw that he &s;lowly &s;taggered towards the town-gate, looking frequently back, &s;topping &s;ometimes irre&s;olute, and &s;eemed to talk to him|&s;elf. He di&s;appeared at la&s;t from his &s;ight, and he was &s;oon after delivered from his trouble&s;ome vi&s;itors.</P>
<P>William was ju&s;t going to rai&s;e his &s;unken &s;pi|rits by a walk in the fields, when a little ragged boy ru&s;hed into his apartment, panting for breath, and gave him a note. William opened it and read:</P>

<P>It would be fruitle&s;s were I to attempt to de|lineate to my readers William's picture in that moment, and my imagination labours in vain to repre&s;ent his picture to you as it &s;tands before my mental eyes. Your imagination mu&s;t come to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and picture to you the rapid changes of his countenance from glowing crim&s;on to death like palene&s;s, the wild di&s;order of his

looks, and the trembling of his hands and feet. Methinks I hear his heart palpitate, agitated by fear, joy, and uncertainty; methinks I &s;ee him fly down &s;tairs without a hat, and &s;hoot down the &s;treet like an arrow, without even knowing <HI>where</HI> to find his father?</P>
<P>"Where? where? &s;tammered he at la&s;t to the boy, who followed him.</P>
<P>"In the &s;uburbs, at the Golden Swan," replied the boy, and William &s;hot along as quick as light|ning, ru&s;hing into the inn, overturning the land|lord, and &s;tammering his: <HI>where? where?"</HI> with increa&s;ing agony.</P>
<P>When the people of the inn &s;aw a man &s;tanding before them without a hat, trembling like an a&s;pen leaf, and with a wild and di&s;ordered look, they thought he was mad. William could not &s;peak; <HI>"where? where?"</HI> was all that he was able to utter, and the innkeeper replied at every inquiry: <HI>"who?&mdash;what?"</HI></P>
<P>The boy had, fortunately, followed him as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, and entered the hou&s;e at the very mo|ment when William, overpowered by the highe&s;t &s;tretch of all his feelings, was ready to &s;woon. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ight of the boy gave him new &s;trength, <HI>"where? where?"</HI> ejaculated he with a &s;aint voice when he &s;aw him.</P>
<P>"Follow me!" replied the boy, running up be|fore him three pair of &s;tairs, and opening the door of a &s;orry garret.</P>
<P>There William beheld upon a tru&s;s of &s;traw, the &s;ame old man who had quitted his apartment a few hours before, and received a crown from him. His eyes were dim, and his di&s;&s;olution was near. His right hand gra&s;ped the crown, the charity which his &s;on had given him. A pitcher of water &s;tood by his &s;ide, and a prayer book lay at his feet.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="037761_0267_100F068D0EC91C48">
William <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lung him&s;elf down by his wretched couch, gra&s;ped the neck of the dying man with his arms, as if he were determined to wre&s;t him out of the hands of death; he &s;till could not find words nor tears to ea&s;e the agony of his heart, &s;hook the fainting old man, wanted to go for a&s;|&s;i&s;tance and yet could not re&s;olve to quit his hap|le&s;s parent. He took his pur&s;e out of his pocket, without knowing clearly what he was doing, flung it down at the feet of his conductor, expecting that he would comprehend his meaning in&s;tantly. However, the boy picked it up, ca&s;ting a &s;tupid &s;heepi&s;h look at him, and then at the pur&s;e, and knew not what to do with it.</P>
<P>"Phy&s;ician! &s;urgeon!" thundered William.</P>
<P>The boy was terrified and flew down &s;tairs.</P>
<P>And, behold! God &s;aid unto the Angel of death: Withdraw thy hand! take the bitter cup from his lips, and mix it with tears of filial love, that the black pinions of de&s;pair cover not his breaking eyes, and he fall &s;miling a&s;leep in thy arms."&mdash;Ortenberg opened his eyes. "Is it you, my &s;on? A ray of joy after twelve years &s;uffering!" William now recovered the power of utterance, a gentle &s;tream of tears removed the agony of his heart. He knelt at the old man's couch with affecting devotion in his looks, thanked God for the bitter &s;weetne&s;s of that hour, and prayed for his father's life.</P>
<P>"Not &s;o, my &s;on! &s;aid the dying &s;ufferer in broken accents: "my hour is at hand; I am hap|py to have found a &s;on who will clo&s;e my eyes, and commit my bones to the grave.

<P>He di&s;patched immediately the ob&s;equious and venal accomplices of his numerous rogueries, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o pur&s;ue Ortenberg in different directions, cau&s;ing the haple&s;s fugitive to be carried to one of his e&s;tates, the &s;teward of which if po&s;&s;ible, was as great a knave as his ma&s;ter, and frequently had en|joyed the frantic &s;atisfaction of having tormented to death an innocent victim that had been intru&s;ted to his care, without ever taking the trouble to inquire after the motives of his confinement.</P>
<P>Poor Ortenberg langui&s;hed in that place twelve years in a damp cellar. Bread and putrid water were his daily nouri&s;hment, the damp ground was his couch and the dark vault his cover.</P>
<P>Belzebub recalled at la&s;t the Devil that inhabi|ted the body of the fiend-like &s;teward, to advance him according to his merits. His &s;ucce&s;&s;or po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;ome humanity, had compa&s;&s;ion on his de|clining pri&s;oner, gave him an opportunity to e&s;|cape, and Ortenberg fled. The unhappy man roved from village to village, fearful of being pur|&s;ued, &s;ick and faint like an autumnal fly, and bordering on a &s;tate of phrenzy, begging his bread from door to door, and &s;upported by nothing el&s;e but th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> hope of being enabled by providence to reach W** before his death, and to conclude in the fir&s;t embrace of his wife and &s;on, an exi&s;tence which had become burden&s;ome to him. He was

obliged to pa&s;s through Gottingen on his way to the dear objects of his love, and there fini&s;hed his &s;uf|ferings.</P>
<P>But what enabled him to di&s;gui&s;e his paternal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eelings and to quit his &s;on's apartment without making him&s;elf known? what el&s;e but his pride, that baneful pa&s;&s;ion that tyranni&s;ed him from his cradle to the grave. He perceived that the young men who were with his &s;on were counts; he be|lieved he &s;hould di&s;grace his &s;on, or even, perhaps, hurt him, if he were to make him&s;elf known, after having applied for alms. In &s;hort he was &s;ilent and went away, but &s;carcely had arrived at his garret, when he was overpowered by the heavy load of his feelings.</P>
<P>Reader, I perceive an angry look in your eye, compo&s;ed of compa&s;&s;ion and indignation; a&s;k your|&s;elf &s;incerely whether you never was guilty of a fault? I wanted to pourtray an hone&s;t man, who always acted as an human being; for my ima|gination is not fit for delineating the picture of an angel.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t violent pa&s;&s;ions convul&s;ed the heart of the young man while his father related the melan|choly tale of his &s;ufferings. He now was torment|ed with dreadful apprehen&s;ion, and his &s;taring eyes hung on the lips of the old man; tears of grief now rolled down his cheeks, and fury now tinged them with a crim&s;on hue, and a wild fire fla&s;hed from his eyes.</P>
<P>"Vengeance! Vengeance!" exclaimed he, when his father had fini&s;hed his melancholy narrative: "I vow to you, my dear injured father! by God and our ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer, that I will take a bloody revenge on the villain!"</P>
<P>"Not &s;o my &s;on," &s;aid the old man: "you mu&s;t promi&s;e me to forgive him, as I do on the brink of eternity. He mu&s;t, be&s;ides now be already

far advanced in years, and &s;oon ripe for judgment. Promi&s;e it me! This is the only condition on which I can give you my paternal ble&s;&s;ing; and only this will enable me to die in peace." William was obliged to obey, and to vow to his dying parent that he would forgive the Governor and never take revenge. Having done this, the old man ble&s;&s;ed him, rai&s;ed his heart to the throne of God, prayed, and took a &s;olemn leave of his &s;on. Wil|liam &s;hed torrents of tears. Ortenberg had ex|hau&s;ted his la&s;t &s;trength, and relap&s;ed exhau&s;ted upon his pillow. He &s;oon began to rattle in his throat&mdash;the angel of death held the cup to his lips&mdash;Nature &s;truggled again&s;t the powerful arm of the la&s;t foe&mdash;&s;pa&s;ms announced his approaching di&s;|&s;olution&mdash;the eyes grew dark&mdash;the cheeks turned pale&mdash;the lips grew blue&mdash;the body &s;tiff&mdash;only one ga&s;p more&mdash;a long pau&s;e&mdash;and now he breathed the la&s;t time!</P>
<P>William's agony is no &s;ubject fit for de&s;cription. The phy&s;ician came too late to &s;ave the father's life a few hours longer, but time enough to order the di&s;tracted young man to be removed from the dear corp&s;e. William was carried home &s;ick and delirious. Only the &s;trength of youth &s;aved him from the gates of death, and the picture of his murdered father was for years con&s;tantly pre&s;ent to his mind, and ca&s;t a gloomy melancholy over his per&s;on.</P>

<HEAD>I.</HEAD>
<P>&mdash;I have made up my mind to quit Gottingen, and am waiting for your orders and advice, my dear uncle, to determine finally upon the place of my re&s;idence, and the career which I am to choo&s;e. I have gathered a tolerable &s;tore of knowledge in various branches of &s;cience, and flatter my&s;elf to be able to do pretty well in any &s;ituation; for a player, who once knows the cards, mu&s;t be equal to enter into the nature of any game which accident throws in his way, and be able to conduct it well, though the trumps &s;hould be in his antagoni&s;t's hands.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid that it would be ea&s;y to write the whole collection of human knowledge which is &s;ounded on <HI>mathematical certainty,</HI> upon a blank card; and we rummage many a thick folio volume in vain to gather a few words which could be added to that collection. I never quit our public library with|out a kind of anxiety; &s;o many books, &s;o much to read; life is &s;o &s;hort, the card &s;o &s;mall, and yet a man mu&s;t be a Polyhi&s;tor to fill it only half. No, no, I will not choo&s;e a learned profe&s;&s;ion! I will rove the boundle&s;s creation of God, will enjoy the variegated plea&s;ures of nature, not pry into its mo&s;t occult my&s;teries in order to form a &s;y&s;tem to-day, which to-morrow would be confuted by the mo&s;t &s;imple phaenomenon. However, while I am pur|&s;uing this idea, an internal monitor whi&s;pers to me: "You are a link in the great &s;ocial chain; it would degrade you were you to &s;pend your uncles wealth in idlene&s;s, and occa&s;ionally to be&s;tow a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">illing upon a fellow-creature in di&s;tre&s;s; your faculties belong to the &s;tate, which protects you in the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of your property." The re|gard

which we have for our <HI>self</HI> is a &s;ingular &s;en&s;ation, it is widely different from that which we have for the merits of others. The latter is but too frequent|ly influenced by the prejudices which we have im|bibed in our youth, by external and accidental attributes, wealth and pedigrees. However, that which affords me &s;atisfaction in &s;olitude, and frequently renders me &s;uperior to &s;ufferings, and the erroneous opinions of the world; in &s;hort, what every hone&s;t man &s;eeks and finds more or le&s;s with|in him&s;elf, cannot be purcha&s;ed of the voice of the low or titled populace.</P>
<P>I will, therefore, devote my&s;elf to &s;ome pro|fe&s;&s;ion, le&s;t I &s;hould be an idle drone in the great bee-hive of the world; I will fly out and in, gather and work: your orders will a&s;&s;ign me my &s;tation.</P>

<HEAD>II. Nicolaus Ortenberg to William.</HEAD>
<P>Give me leave to tell you, my dear nephew, that neither the beginning nor the conclu&s;ion of your letter has met with my approbation. To &s;peak the truth, William, you have cea&s;ed being the &s;imple child of nature which you was when you left the hou&s;e of your venerable Mentor. The periods and turnings of your letter are &s;tiff and affected; you pre&s;ume to be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the true philo&s;ophy of life, although you are only a book philo&s;opher. We mu&s;t have &s;een the world, and experienced &s;ome, if we are not to be a&s;toni&s;hed by every un|common appearance, and de&s;ire to bear the joys and &s;ufferings of this world with equanimity. Hark ye, my &s;on, when you write again to your uncle, let your letter be more cordial and familiar&punc; I hate all formality and cold civility in letters which one friend writes to another. Speak the &s;imple and
<PB N="121" REF="037761_0275_100F069EB7EBFE88">
artle&s;s language of the heart, and fear not to of|fend me by frank bluntne&s;s. As for the &s;tation which you are to choo&s;e, it is nothing to me; this is entirely your bu&s;ine&s;s. I don't care what you are, while you are an hone&s;t man, and this you can be in any &s;tation. However, it would give me plea&s;ure if you would rove the world a few years longer, and then take a good and gentle wife like my Welli! Alas! I have not yet learnt to pro|nounce or to write her name without &s;hedding tears.</P>
<P>The workmen have fini&s;hed ye&s;terday the little temple in the garden, and the altar in the middle, upon which the urn is to &s;tand that enclo&s;es the a&s;hes of my Welli. I took the urn out of the che&s;t in which it was locked up ever &s;ince I left the Ea&s;t Indies; for I had not the courage to tear my wounds open. As I was &s;aying, I took it out, and found a pair of bracelets and &s;ome rings of my Welli's in the che&s;t, and &s;trolled with it into the garden. My tears fell upon the urn, my hands trembled &s;everal times &s;o violently, that I almo&s;t dropt it, and my knees knocked together. I was obliged to re&s;t my&s;elf upon a turf &s;eat. The urn now &s;tands upon the altar, the temple is hedged in with ro&s;e-trees, and bears the following in&s;cription:
<Q>TOMB OF THE GOOD WELLI, THE GENTLEST OF HER SEX.</Q></P>
<P>When my tears once &s;hall be dried up, that is, when my eyes &s;hall be &s;hut forever, it is to remind you, my dear nephew, that I loved my dear Welli better than any thing in this world. I hope you then will vi&s;it our a&s;hes every morning and evening, and think of us.</P>
<P>I command you, nephew, and de&s;ire it of you as the only return for my paternal love, not to let me

be buried when I am dead. This is a fooli&s;h cu&s;|tom, and I will have nothing to do with it. Some millions of dead bodies are annually buried under ground, to infe&s;t the air with pe&s;tilential exhalations, to a&s;&s;i&s;t death in his de&s;tructive operations, and to enrich the phy&s;icians. The church yards ought to be divided among&s;t poor families to be turned into fertile fields, for the benefit of the living. But the corp&s;es&mdash;Why they ought to be burnt as they do in the Ea&s;t-Indies, and in other countries, which would prevent them from going through all tho&s;e horrid degrees of corruption, and to reduce them at once to du&s;t, from which they were taken.</P>
<P>I once was in a mu&s;eum, where I &s;aw corrup|tion imitated in wax, by a &s;kilful arti&s;t, and I a&s;&s;ure you, William, it was horrid to &s;ee how the eyes are covered fir&s;t with a kind of mo&s;s, and the &s;tate of the dead body grows more frightful every day. I prefer the burning of the dead to their being bu|ried; be&s;ides this, al&s;o on account of the living relations and friends. They drag you out of the town, &s;crewed up in a box, bury you &s;ix or &s;even feet under ground, rai&s;e a tomb over you, and leave you to rot. Your friends and relations forget you, have nothing that could remind them of you, and at mo&s;t, ca&s;t on Sunday, when they go to church, a look at your grave as they pa&s;s, to &s;ee whether it be not yet overgrown with gra&s;s? If your relations remove from the paternal &s;oil, to &s;ome di&s;tant country, you remain behind, rot among &s;trangers, are forgotten, and your name occupies at mo&s;t a &s;mall &s;pace in the church regi&s;ter, or on the genealogy, and you are entirely expung|ed from the hearts of tho&s;e that were dear to you.</P>
<P>It is quite otherwi&s;e if the flame &s;aves your body from corruption. The &s;mall heap of a&s;hes which remain, are carefully gathered by the hands of your widow, your children, or your friend; their eyes

moi&s;ten the dear relics with affectionate tears, they are inclo&s;ed in an urn, and if your friends &s;hould not be able or inclined to pre&s;erve that urn in a temple, like that which I erected to the me|mory of my dear Welli, they may place it upon a table under the looking gla&s;s, in&s;tead of your French clocks, conduct their children to it, take off the cover, and &s;hew them the &s;mall remains of an human being, and I am &s;ure, this will make a deeper im|pre&s;&s;ion upon their hearts than their &s;tanding with horror before a grave, from which corruption grins, and pe&s;tilential vapours infe&s;t their &s;melling organs.</P>
<P>Do you imagine my &s;on, that the Romans and Greeks, who&s;e hi&s;tory I read with admiration in my &s;olitude, would have performed &s;uch heroic deeds, and devoted them&s;elves &s;o cheerfully to death, if they had been obliged to &s;uffer their bodies to be committed to the nau&s;eous and horrid operations of corruptions? You may &s;mile! I am no p&s;ychiologi&s;t; however, this &s;uppo&s;ition has a great deal of probability in my opinion. And it is, be&s;ides &s;uch a &s;ublime &s;ight to &s;ee the flame blaze aloft, and the &s;moke tower to the &s;kies&mdash;one &s;hould think the &s;pirit were ri&s;ing like a phoenix from his a&s;hes.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, my &s;on, I de&s;ire to be burnt after my death! I have already be&s;poke an urn which is to contain the remains of my old bones, and reque&s;t you to place it near that of my dear Welli. You then may &s;ometimes take a walk to the temple with your wife and children, in the du&s;k of eve, relate my hi&s;tory to them, and think of me.</P>
<P>In ca&s;e death &s;hould &s;urpri&s;e me unexpectedly, and before I have declared my la&s;t will as to this point, you are to con&s;ider this letter as my te&s;ta|ment, and produce it before the magi&s;trates, to prevent all di&s;putes with the&s;e gentlemen. I

She was as lively as ever, abandoned her&s;elf to her humourous gaiety, laugh|ed and gave a free vent to her jovial mirth.

My father in&s;i&s;ts on my having it con&s;tantly before my eyes, le&s;t I &s;hould forget her maternal admonitions."&mdash;I cannot but confe&s;s that I was &s;o much &s;urpri&s;ed at that &s;ingular idea, as to fix my eyes &s;ometime mute and immoveable on the &s;kull. I had known her mother, her form was before my eyes, and now nothing was left but tho&s;e old bones. Indeed, I was more powerfully affected than I &s;hould have been upon her grave. And what do you think, kind reader? Suppo&s;e the young lady had really been as giddy as &s;he was virtuous. Suppo&s;e her profe&s;&s;ion had expo&s;ed her daily to the &s;nares of &s;eduction, and &s;he had already been reduced to the brink of ruin: would not a &s;ingle look at that &s;kull have been &s;ufficient to recal her to the path of virtue?&mdash;Do not object that time weakens impre&s;&s;ions of that nature, and at la&s;t expunges them entirely.&mdash;The mother was already two years dead, and the tears of the daughter dropped warm upon my hand.

<P>I am now at Hanover, deare&s;t uncle, and wi&s;h to &s;tay a few weeks longer here. You will there|fore be &s;o kind as to &s;end your letters and the mo|ney I am to have to this place; I lodge at the Lon|don Tavern. Baron W**, an academic friend of mine, was the original cau&s;e of my &s;topping here. I am very well plea&s;ed with Hanover, the town has &s;everal pretty &s;treets, and fine buildings; the circumjacent country is beautiful, and I have been introduced to &s;ome very enlightened and worthy men.

<P>I have &s;pent an evening with the excellent Mr. Zimmerman, who&s;e book on Solitude, as you in|formed me lately, contributes &s;o much to &s;weeten your &s;olitary retirement. He appears in the fir&s;t quarter of an hour to be cold and repelling, the cau&s;e of which is, probably, to be imputed to the impertinent intru&s;ions of tho&s;e mechanical tra|vellers

who come only to &s;tare at him, and to be able to &s;ay; I have &s;een the famous Zimmerman. But when he perceives that he has a man before him who&s;e heart is &s;u&s;ceptible of congenial warmth and unre&s;erved communication, the chilling clouds which hang on his brow di&s;appear gradually, and his looks be&s;peak &s;o much mildne&s;s and good na|ture as to captivate the heart irre&s;i&s;tibly, which has been my ca&s;e.

They make a di&s;tinction here between higher and inferior no|bility, and the former think it would be a di&s;grace to them, were they to &s;pend only a few hours with the latter under one roof, or even in the open air. As I am but a vile plebian, and my ance&s;|tors were only permitted to look at theirs while they tilted and broke each other's bones, you may ea&s;ily imagine that they &s;carcely deign to look at me.

intrin&s;ic worth of which you can be proud, &s;ince you degrade your&s;elf to be &s;hone upon by the bor|rowed rays of a lamp.

<P>I do, however, by no means intend to infer by this remark that a nobleman, a baron, or a count, cannot be a warm friend of a plebian; God forbid I &s;hould be &s;o unju&s;t.

<P>You are perfectly right, my dear uncle.

<P>It was five o'clock in the afternoon, la&s;t Mon|day &s;e'nnight, when my friend introduced me to the mini&s;ter, Baron Wall. There was a kind of rout,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>A rout at five o'clock in the afternoon? What un|fa&s;hionable bears the&s;e Germans are?</P>
<P><HI>Note of the Printer.</HI></P></NOTE> or whatever they call it; a dozen of card tables &s;tood in a &s;pacious apartment, painted ladies and &s;weet-&s;cented gentlemen &s;at round them&punc; a tea table &s;tood before the &s;ofa, on which &s;at a

charming girl who poured out the tea; I &s;ay, <HI>a girl</HI>&mdash;for every one that beheld her lovely per&s;on forgot that &s;he was a <HI>Lady of rank.</HI></P>
<P>Baron Wall received me with a cheerful and en|gaging countenance, yet without denying the man of rank. He is far advanced in years; his face is the picture of old German hone&s;ty, his grey hair grew white in the &s;ervice of the &s;tate, and no one can help loving the man at fir&s;t &s;ight. The ca&s;e &s;tands differently with regard to the Barone&s;s, who&s;e eyes and no&s;e be&s;peak the Hanoverian family-pride; &s;he can laugh in a mo&s;t chilling and arrogant man|ner, is proud of the &s;tation of her hu&s;band, and looks with pity down upon the inferior cla&s;&s;es of beings, like an angel, if I may u&s;e this &s;imile, upon an ant-hill. She returned my &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive bow with half a nod of her head, and did me the honour not to &s;peak a word to me. The whole company took notice of me, whi&s;pers went from ear to ear, and when they had a&s;certained that I was not of noble extraction, the games were continued with|out f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rther interruption.</P>
<P>The card tables which were before unoccupied, now were p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">opled by degrees. I was invited to en|gage in a party at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">'hombre with a plebian coun&s;ellor and an en&s;ign, who were looked upon as the lowe&s;t in rank (for here they pay regard to the difference of rank even at the card table); but as I am an ene|my to cards they turned their backs on me, as a per&s;on who knows nothing of the <HI>bon ton,</HI> and left me at liberty to amu&s;e my&s;elf as well as I could. I walked up and down the apartment, looked at the prints, teazed the parrot, counted the gla&s;s-panes, and did not know what to do with my humble &s;elf.</P>
<P>Lack of amu&s;ement led me at la&s;t into an ad|joining apartment, where four or five young la|dies were &s;itting engaged in cheerful chat; for the unmarried ladies are here rar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ly admitted to the
<PB N="131" REF="037761_0285_100F06B3D8F7CCC8">
card tables. Although I am no <HI>misogyn,</HI> yet I always was to that moment <HI>timid</HI> in female circles, and as my gallantry is but &s;o &s;o, I found it really difficult to introduce my&s;elf to them in a proper manner. An hone&s;t man is never more in danger of acting like a blockhead than when he is to con|ver&s;e with young ladies of rank to whom he is an utter &s;tranger. The dear creatures do not a&s;k whether the man who is pre&s;ented to them be learned, a pattern of probity and a de&s;erving member of the &s;tate, who&s;e exterior&mdash;though it &s;hould be rather ridiculous&mdash;ought not to come into con&s;ideration; no, they review him at the fir&s;t bow from top to toe, let all his motions, all the different pieces of his dre&s;s run the gauntlet through hundreds of curious looks, comment on every word he utters, laugh if his wai&s;tcoat be too long or his bag too large, and frequently mar|ry him after all, and blu&s;h at their folly.</P>
<P>I do not recollect how I extricated my&s;elf from that dilemma. The young ladies &s;eemed to be rather frolick&s;ome, but for the re&s;t, were good and harmle&s;s creatures, who&s;e acquaintance I made in a trice. They a&s;ked me how I liked Hanover? whether I intended to make a long &s;tay, &amp;c. &amp;c. The conver&s;ation was &s;oon at an end, the replies and que&s;tions grew drier and drier, and I &s;ecretly rejoiced at the fortunate idea of Lady Amelia (the Baron's daughter whom I had fir&s;t &s;een at the tea-table,) who laid her work down and went to a piano forte, which &s;tood at the other end of the apartment. "I don't care (thought I) how indifferently &s;he plays; it will at lea&s;t &s;ave me the trouble of talking non&s;en&s;e; I need but pretend to be all ear, and may give vent to my thought as I plea&s;e." I placed a couple of chairs by the in&s;trument, for her and my&s;elf, and we &s;at down.</P>

Amalia laid a &s;onata of Ho&s;min&s;ter upon the de&s;k, and pulled off her gloves. Gracious hea|ven! what a hand did I perceive! So white, &s;o round, &s;o little and &s;o full&mdash;whoever is led through life by &s;uch a hand mu&s;t walk on ro&s;es. But all this was nothing to what followed. She began to play, and her notes &s;tole upon my heart. The tip of every finger &s;eemed to have a &s;oul; every movement of the &s;weet enchantre&s;s &s;poke forcibly to the heart. I thought it dangerous to li&s;ten any longer to her enchanting &s;trains, and was going to withdraw my eyes from the beautiful hand, when they unfortunately were caught by her bo&s;om, which rendered my &s;ituation &s;till more dangerous. I tell you, dear uncle, there is not &s;uch another bo&s;om in the world. If the fire of your imagina|tion &s;hould be extingui&s;hed, you need but recal to your memory that happy moment when you met your &s;ainted Welli the fir&s;t time, and was hailed by the &s;ight of her &s;welling bo&s;om. What you felt then was but trifling, it was Greenland cold, if com|pared with the fire which ran through my veins while I &s;at by Amalia's &s;ide. How the tran&s;parent gauze heaved and was &s;welled! Cato would have &s;miled, and Plato, forgetting his dreams, blinked at her neckerchief with half-clo&s;ed eyes. I grew dizzy, forgot my&s;elf, dropped my head, and my lips imprinted a warm ki&s;s upon her hand. Amalia blu&s;hed; my perplexity was greater than I can expre&s;s. She continued to play, was out of time, touched the wrong keys; I knew not where I was. In &s;hort, our hearts had under&s;tood each other; however, I &s;hall tell you in my next letter, <HI>how</HI> I betrayed her eyes, and at la&s;t her lips, into the &s;weet confe&s;&s;ion that I am not indifferent to her, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>

<P>However, all this is nothing to me.

<P>Being &s;ure of your approbation, I have ven|tured to make application to the parents of my Amelia; they were &s;tartled and perplexed, and gave me an ambiguous an&s;wer. I reque&s;ted my friend W** to reconnoitre the ground for me; a whole week was &s;pent in con&s;ultations with the whole family. My plebian origin was put in one &s;cale, and my five thou&s;and a year was put in the other; the tongue was in the middle.

<P><PB N="135" REF="037761_0289_100F06BC38818BB0">
They &s;ent me at la&s;t word by a near relation, that I &s;hould have the girl if I would purcha&s;e a patent for nobility. It is a mere whim my dear uncle, but what can I do? Amalia is innocent of it, and my happine&s;s is at &s;take. I have already &s;poken to a genealogi&s;t, and &s;hewn him our fami|ly &s;eal, which as you know has a man with a whip upon the helmet. He a&s;&s;ures me that our family mu&s;t be extremely old, and proves by our arms that it formerly was noble. He &s;ays the Scythi|ans had once made a long inroad into A&s;ia; their &s;laves &s;eized upon their hou&s;es and wives during their ab&s;ence, and took to arms, when their ma&s;|ters returned. After they had &s;ought a long time with alternate &s;ucce&s;s, an old Scythian pro|po&s;ed at la&s;t to his brethren in arms, to u&s;e only the whip again&s;t the refractory &s;laves, in&s;tead of warlike weapons. His idea was generally appro|ved and carried into execution; every warrior &s;eized a whip, the &s;ight of which recalled all the &s;ervile pu&s;illanimity of the &s;laves, and behold they threw down their arms, and took to flight. The Novogarodians, who&s;e town lies in Sarma|tia, &s;truck a medallion in memory of that event, upon which a hor&s;eman brandi&s;hes a long whip; and the old Scythian who fir&s;t &s;tarted that idea, was permitted to bear the man with the whip in his arms.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, dear uncle, that our family is pretty ancient. I expect your an&s;wer with impatience, and hope you will have the kindne&s;s to &s;end me a bill of exchange; for you know that now a-days a per&s;on mu&s;t have money if he wants to be made a <HI>noble man.</HI></P>

<P>No, no, William, it cannot be! Your genea|logi&s;t is a fool as well as your&s;elf. How can you talk of Scythians and Sarmatians? We are hone&s;t Germans and nothing el&s;e. I will give you an explanation in my manner of the fellow with the whip. I &s;hould think that our ance&s;tor was an hone&s;t carter who led his waggon and his four greys or blacks from one town to the other, and walked humbly by the &s;ide of his cattle. He, probably, &s;aved as much by his indu&s;try, as en|abled him to make him&s;elf comfortable in his old age, and to leave a good fortune to his children. His children being de&s;irous to pre&s;erve the me|mory of their indu&s;trious father in the family, put a carter with a whip at the top of the hel|met, where it has remained to the pre&s;ent day. This &s;ounds more natural and probable than the &s;tory of your genealogi&s;t, and you need not be a&s;hamed of having had a carter for an ance&s;tor, for his profe&s;&s;ion was ten times more honourable than that of an highwayman, which was that of all the cavaliers of tho&s;e times.</P>
<P>There has been one before you of our family, who was as great a fool as your&s;elf. He did not like the carters whip, and pretended that it ought to be a monk with a &s;courge, a&s;&s;erting boldly that the engraver had lengthened it out of igno|rance into a whip. I never &s;hall forget the an|&s;wer which my father gave him. "Cou&s;in," &s;aid he, "would you rather have a lazy big bellied monk for an ance&s;tor, than an indu&s;trious u&s;eful carter? The &s;courge has never been able to drive any evil out of the world, but we owe, perhaps,
<PB N="137" REF="037761_0291_100F06C0517C1300">
to the whip, our pre&s;ent pro&s;perity." Hark ye, nephew, the&s;e were the &s;entiments of your grand|father, I would therefore advi&s;e you not to &s;peak di&s;re&s;pectfully of the whip.</P>
<P>As for your <HI>purchasing</HI> a title at Vienna, I will not hear another word of it. A title bought for money is &s;till le&s;s worth, than one that has been inherited, and &s;ince I have read in <HI>Schloe|zer's</HI> Journal how much is to be paid for a patent of a count, baron, and nobleman, I cannot help thinking with contempt of the&s;e de&s;picable prac|tices.</P>
<P>The be&s;towing of titles was originally a mo&s;t excellent in&s;titution; they were obtained only by merit and courage, and the dignity of knight did not even de&s;cend to the children. The &s;ame practice is &s;till kept up in China and other rational countries, where the father is a mini&s;ter of &s;tate while the &s;on is a common &s;ailor, if he be not de&s;erving of a better &s;tation. Such a title is worth while accepting, and we bow willingly to &s;uch a noble man.

Our &s;overeigns ought to be a&s;hamed of be|&s;towing for the &s;ake of dirty lucre, their patent's nobility, to fellows who have no other merit be|&s;ides that which they derive from their pelf, and thereby de&s;troy the &s;pur of honour which is the main &s;pring of monarchies.</P>

The confident tone in which he had an|nounced

his uncle's con&s;ent, procured him free acce&s;s to the Baron's hou&s;e; he was permitted to take a &s;eat by Amalia's &s;ide at table, to attend her on her excur&s;ions, yea, even to &s;ee her &s;ometimes in her own apartment. The &s;weet girl, accu&s;tom|ed her&s;elf to regard him as her intended hu&s;|band, gave free vent to all her feelings, and gra|dually buried the arrow of love &s;o deep in her bo|&s;om, as neither to be able nor inclined to pull it out again.</P>
<P>The old hone&s;t Baron who in the very begin|ning had approved of young Ortenberg's court|&s;hip, but was entirely under petticoat government, was rejoiced, on account of the &s;mallne&s;s of his fortune, to have an opportunity of marrying Ama|lia, his darling daughter, to a man like Orten|berg; he cared nothing about his plebeian ori|gin, and the fooli&s;h demand that he &s;hould pur|cha&s;e a title at Vienna, originated entirely in the head of his dear helpmate. The Barone&s;s was, indeed, glad to have an opportunity of getting rid of a girl who&s;e blooming beauty eclip&s;ed her &s;ading charms.</P>
<P>She re&s;olved, at the &s;ame time, to conde&s;cend to accept of her intended &s;on-in-law, a pre&s;ent of a pair of brilliant ear-rings, or any precious trifle of that &s;ort, and to do him the honour of giving &s;plendid balls and &s;umptuous &s;uppers at his ex|pence, which the declining &s;tate of her pur&s;e, and the univer&s;al intru&s;ion of her plebeian creditors, had prevented her to do for years. How grateful &s;oever the&s;e pro&s;pects were to her favourite pro|pen&s;ities; yet I would not have the reader to &s;up|po&s;e that they were &s;ufficient to procure her con|&s;ent to receive William without a title into her family. Her mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">o was: <HI>Pain bis et honneur!</HI> and if William, like the kings of Per&s;ia, could have a&s;&s;igned the revenues of a whole province

for every piece of her dre&s;s, all his provinces would have been ranked among that cla&s;s of things which, indeed, can be borrowed without being paid for, but cannot be compared with a rotten piece of parchment.</P>
<P>Poor William! the po&s;t is arrived, the po&s;tman is already in the &s;treet in which you live, you &s;tand at the window with a beating heart, he en|ters your hou&s;e, the &s;ervant brings you a letter, which, indeed, is &s;ealed with the family &s;eal, up|on which the Scythian brandi&s;hes his whip, but is &s;o light and thin, that it is impo&s;&s;ible it could contain a few hundreds of yellow comforters. But who knows? the u&s;eful invention of bills of exchange, which alone ought to be &s;ufficient to endear the Jews to us, affords &s;ome rea&s;on to hope that it may be animated with a &s;lip of paper which begins with the words: Plea&s;e to pay three weeks after date, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>He opened the letter, read it impatiently, threw it indignantly upon the table, took it up again, peru&s;ed it once more, and folded it and at la&s;t put it into his pocket with a deep &s;igh. "What &s;hall I do? what will the Barone&s;s &s;ay? what A|malia? what her father?" The&s;e que&s;tions re|volved in his head like the vortices of Carte&s;ius, till he re&s;olved at la&s;t to write once more to his uncle, to attack his heart with the eloquence of love, to paint his di&s;con&s;olation, his de&s;pair and to leave his mi&s;tre&s;s and her parents in the error that he had not yet received an an&s;wer from his uncle, till he &s;hould have a&s;certained what effect his epi&s;tle would have on his flinty heart.</P>
<P>He &s;at down and drew up a letter, but I mu&s;t decline repeating to my readers all the arguments and ideas which he introduced; for his di&s;con&s;o|late epi&s;tle &s;welled to the &s;ize of a book, a trea|ti&s;e in which he laboured to prove, that it is ab|&s;olutely

nece&s;&s;ary we &s;hould accommodate our|&s;elves to the follies and humours of the world, &s;upporting his arguments by the opinions of anci|ent and modern philo&s;ophers, and non-philo&s;o|phers, and elucidating them by a powerful ho&s;t of examples. "Would you not, my deare&s;t un|cle," wrote he among&s;t others: "have thought the old Bramin Akbar to be the mo&s;t cruel and unju&s;t of men, if he had refu&s;ed to unite his Welli to you, becau&s;e you was no Tamulian, and did not belong to his ca&s;t?"</P>
<P>"Very true!" replied Nicolaus: "and I give you leave to form any opinion of Baron Wall, who will not let you have his daughter, becau&s;e you are no Baron."</P>
<P>"Did you not your&s;elf," continued William: "&s;ubmit to the rites which he pre&s;cribed to you? Did you not perform the <HI>Sandi wane,</HI> did you not adorn the <HI>Lingam</HI> with flowers, not becau&s;e you thought this was a more powerful ceremony, than the &s;prinkling with holy water, but becau&s;e the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Welli depended upon the perform|ance of that ceremony? Believe me, deare&s;t un|cle, we &s;hould be compelled to fly to dreary de|&s;arts, to turn <HI>Anchorites,</HI> and to renounce the con|ver&s;ation with men for ever, if we were to re|fu&s;e every little &s;acrifice to the rooted prejudices of our times. You are more to me than a fa|ther, you gave me more than life, for I owe to your generous care every accompli&s;hment of my mind which renders me worthy of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing my Amalia. You de&s;troy your own work, and rob me in one moment of every thing you gave me, by depriving me of that &s;weet hope. Amalia alone is able to &s;pur me to arrive at greater per|fection, and I &s;hall turn a villain, if I cannot ob|tain her."</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="037761_0297_100F06CC91500990">
"You may turn any thing," replied Nicolaus, "except a nobleman <HI>for money.</HI> Did I not tell you that you &s;hould endeavour to de&s;erve a title by your merits? Have you no courage to earn an order by devoting your abilities to the &s;tate? Fie, &s;hame! Love ought to rai&s;e your &s;entiments, and you whine like an effeminate Corydon."</P>
<P>"Well, I then will turn &s;oldier!" exclaimed William in a pa&s;&s;ion: "the military line is the only one in which I may hope to purcha&s;e that mi&s;erable di&s;tinction at the expence of my blood. I will fly to encounter dangers! I will <HI>voluntari|ly fly</HI> into the mid&s;t of &s;cenes of carnage and de|&s;truction, to which the grey veteran <HI>creeps</HI> trem|bling and reluctant, will attract the general's no|tice, and either wre&s;t an order from the icy hand of death, or fall on the field of battle."</P>
<P>Thus &s;poke William, glowing with youthful ar|dour, and animated by the fire of the mo&s;t ar|dent love, with enthu&s;ia&s;tic fervour. His amo|rous frenzy made it appear as ea&s;y to him to mount the &s;ummit of the Cordilleras, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> it would be be to &s;tep over an ant hill. However, he found it by far more difficult to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the re&s;olu|tion to &s;hew to his mi&s;tre&s;s, and her proud mo|ther, the mountains which <HI>prejudice</HI> on one &s;ide, and well meant <HI>pertinacity</HI> on the other had thrown up between them. Amalia &s;oon read me|lancholy in his eyes, and drew the dreadful &s;ecret from his heart.</P>
<P>After an awful pau&s;e, during which a pearly tear &s;tole from her blue eye, &s;he offered him her hand with a mournful &s;mile:</P>
<P>"Dear William! &s;aid &s;he: I am &s;carcely &s;even|teen years old, and you are only in your twenty|fifth. I will remain con&s;tant to you."</P>
<P>That William &s;wam in an ocean of bli&s;s, that he cla&s;ped Amalia in his arms, and &s;ealed the vow

One day&mdash;he ju&s;t had received a letter from Amalia, new &s;ire rolled through his veins, he felt him&s;elf bold enough to ru&s;h into the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t hazardous dangers&mdash;on that day he rode with about twenty of his men round the enemy's camp, teazing the out-po&s;ts, when he &s;uddenly heard a firing of pi&s;tols at &s;ome di&s;tance. He rode towards the place of action, and &s;aw a &s;mall party of Pru&s;&s;ians fighting again&s;t a &s;uperior num|ber of Au&s;trian hu&s;&s;ars. An old Pru&s;&s;ian General had ventured too far on a reconnoitring party, his retreat was cut off, and he was &s;o dangerou&s;ly wounded as &s;carcely to be able to keep him&s;elf in the &s;addle.

<P>"That he had been &s;urpri&s;ed on a reconnoitring party, by a &s;uperior number of enemies, that Captain Ortenberg had come to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the mo&s;t critical moment, and re&s;cued him by his uncommon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ravery from the Au&s;trians, notwith|&s;tanding their great &s;uperiority; that he not only
<PB N="152" REF="037761_0306_100F06DF5A9F71E8">
had &s;aved his life, but al&s;o rendered the State the mo&s;t important &s;ervice, as he had plans and papers in his letter-ca&s;e, which, without Ortenberg's a&s;|&s;i&s;tance would unavoidably have fallen into the hands of the Au&s;trians. He added, he could not reflect without trembling on the dreadful con&s;e|quences which this might have produced, and re|que&s;ted the king to reward the brave Captain ac|cording to his de&s;erts."</P>
<P>He &s;igned the report with a trembling hand, and di&s;patched it by a courier. William quitted the tent, and the General was left in private with his chaplain.</P>
<P>It is no difficult ta&s;k to convert, at the brink of the grave, a libertine, who never took the trouble to &s;in after principles, and was a free-thinker, for no other rea&s;on than that of having an opportunity to &s;tun his con&s;cience. The <HI>Rev. Mr. Simson,</HI> a &s;tout &s;quare-bodied man, who had courage enough to exchange the bible for a &s;word, in ca&s;e of ne|ce&s;&s;ity, and to march at the head of an army, now rai&s;ed his thundering voice, &s;haking the con&s;ci|ence of the wounded &s;inner, which ju&s;t &s;eemed to awake from a long lethargy, painted the eternity of damnation in horrid colours, and a&s;&s;ured the officers on coming out of the tent, after having exerted his pulmonary powers two hours, that he had &s;aved a &s;oul from the clutches of the devil.</P>
<P>The General him&s;elf imagined that he was &s;ud|denly transformed into a pious Chri&s;tian; and this per&s;ua&s;ion la&s;ted&mdash;till his wounds began to mend, contrary to all expectation, and he grew tired of repenting. In &s;hort, he was &s;o much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in three weeks, as to be able to keep a faro-bank at his bed-&s;ide, and after the lap&s;e of five weeks, threw him&s;elf again into the arms of a &s;trumpet.</P>
<P>It is but natural that he now was a&s;hamed of having betrayed &s;o much weakne&s;s, as he called it,
<PB N="153" REF="037761_0307_100F06E1DAE27240">
and &s;hunned William's company as much as po&s;&s;i|ble. He &s;carcely &s;poke to him when he could not avoid him, &s;poke doubtfully of his courage, to palliate his ingratitude to his pre&s;erver, and at la&s;t, when William's pre&s;ence became more and more intolerable to him, conceived the diabolical de&s;ign of making away with him in an un&s;u&s;pected man|ner. He contrived for this purpo&s;e to cau&s;e Wil|liam to be commanded to all po&s;ts of danger. The artle&s;s young man, who thir&s;ted after honour, and &s;u&s;pected no treachery, went cheerfully wherever he was ordered, and always returned to the camp with additional laurels.</P>
<P>The fame of his courage and zeal for the &s;er|vice, had already reached the ears of the com|mander in chief. He enjoyed the re&s;pect and love of his brother officers, and was e&s;teemed by his &s;uperiors. Fortune &s;miled on him.</P>
<P>He was ordered one day to e&s;cort a waggon with money, and left the camp at the fir&s;t dawn of day. He had not been many hours ab&s;ent when a courier arrived from Berlin, and among other di&s;patches al&s;o brought intelligence that the king had been plea&s;ed to grant the brevet of a major to Captain Ortenberg, and to honour him with the order of <HI>Pour le Merite.</HI></P>
<P>Ortenberg's promotion was made known in the army. No countenance be&s;poke envy, &s;incere joy &s;parkled in every eye; every one wi&s;hed to be the fir&s;t harbinger of that fortunate event; the return of William's regiment was impatiently waited for; &s;ome of his more intimate friends rode out of the camp, to meet him.</P>
<P>The regiment returned at la&s;t in the evening. It had been obliged to &s;kirmi&s;h a great deal; the greater part of it had been cut to pieces, many officers wounded, and &s;ome killed&mdash;Captain Or|tenberg was among the latter. A pi&s;tol &s;hot had
<PB N="154" REF="037761_0308_100F06E457C1FC48">
wounded him in the neck; he &s;till kept his &s;eat, though with difficulty, when another perforated his brea&s;t, and he dropt from his hor&s;e. His lieu|tenant attempted to carry him away; but he was already dying. Collecting his la&s;t remaining &s;trength, he pulled his watch out of his pocket, gave it to the lieutenant, and conjured him by their mutual friend&s;hip, to deliver it him&s;elf to Amalia, and to reque&s;t her to keep it in remem|brance of a man who had died for her. The lieu|tenant gave him his word of honour, and he breath|ed his la&s;t.</P>
<P>Many a rough warrior, many a veteran grena|dier wept a tear after him. His corp&s;e was con|veyed to the camp and buried with all military honours.</P>
<P>The order of <HI>Pour le Merite</HI> adorned his <HI>coffin.</HI></P>

<P>"HE was an excellent fellow! upon my &s;oul he was!" groaned Nicolaus when he heard that his nephew was dead. "Alas! I now &s;it here lik Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe on his &s;olitary i&s;land, have

every thing in abundance and am neverthele&s;s de&s;|titute of all comforts. The architect has built a beautiful hou&s;e for me; but, alas! it is &s;o large, &s;o empty; when I blow my no&s;e in my bed room the &s;ervants hear it in the kitchen, and my apart|ment is as &s;ilent as the grave when my Canary|birds and parrots don't chu&s;e to chatter; one could hear the death-watch click. I have a fine garden laid out after <HI>Hirshfeld'</HI>s theory; however there is no other beaten path in it but that which leads to Welli's mau&s;oleum, and I have no per&s;on that calls me from that favourite &s;pot. I have a beau|tiful pro&s;pect into the mountains, but there is not a &s;oul to whom I could &s;ay: look, what a charm|ing view is this! Of what u&s;e is my hoard of gold to me? not even a beggar knocks at my door with whom I could &s;hare it.&mdash;I have lived long enough! a per&s;on may, &s;ometimes live too long.&mdash;Why did I not rever&s;e the mad law of the Indians? Why did I not &s;hare the blazing pile with the corp&s;e of my dear wife? Who will now execute my la&s;t will? Who will commit my body to the flames?&mdash;Un|feeling and heartle&s;s hirelings will &s;urround me when my breath is gone, inca&s;e my body in a dark box, and commit it to corruption.&mdash;Fy! I have, indeed, lived too long!"</P>
<P>"Thus moaned old hone&s;t Nicolaus in his &s;oli|tude, and he grew week after week more tired of the world. He ro&s;e from his couch, becau&s;e the morning dawned, and had not &s;lept; he ate, becau&s;e it was dinner time, and was not hungry; he went to bed, becau&s;e it was night, and was not &s;leepy.</P>
<P>He was &s;oon tired of leading &s;uch a vegetative life. He wi&s;hed impatiently for the &s;ociety of &s;ome &s;ympathizing being on who&s;e hand he could walk to the peaceful grave. He con&s;idered &s;ome time, and at la&s;t &s;at down to his de&s;k and wrote to Han|over to Baron Wall.</P>
<LETTER>
<PB N="157" REF="037761_0311_100F06E9556D1F68">
<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>The charms of your daughter have co&s;t my poor nephew his life; I demand an indemnification for that lo&s;s, I con&s;ider your Amalia as the widow of my &s;on, and wi&s;h to be permitted to call her daugh|ter. I am an old fellow, po&s;&s;e&s;s two hundred thou|&s;and dollars in hard ca&s;h, a hou&s;e and jewels which are worth as much again. Let me &s;hare it with Amalia. I want nothing in return but her compa|ny. She &s;hall clo&s;e my eyes and cau&s;e my body to be burnt. I have only a few years more to live and then &s;he will be my &s;ole heire&s;s. I &s;hall, indeed not purcha&s;e a title; however, my calling her doughter will not deprive her of her nobility, and &s;he may be&s;tow her hand upon a count when I am dead.</P>
<P>We two old fellows &s;hall, probably not meet in <HI>this</HI> life: however, I will give you a faithful account of her in the <HI>next</HI> world; upon my &s;oul I will.</P>
<P>I beg you will have the goodne&s;s to give the en|clo&s;ed trifles to your &s;pou&s;e in my name.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Nicolaus Ortenberg.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>The inclo&s;ed trifles co&s;i&s;ted of a &s;et of brlliants worth above eight thou&s;and dollars.</P>
<P>Poor Amalia had not enjoyed one hour of hap|pine&s;s &s;ince William's departure. While <HI>Hope,</HI> that plea&s;ing deceiver, lived in her bo&s;om, &s;he bore patiently every har&s;h treatment of her proud mo|ther, and when her worthy father one day brought her a new&s;paper in which Ortenberg's name was mentioned with applau&s;e, her virgin cheeks glowed with the crim&s;on hue of de&s;ire; her loving heart beat with fond expectation. She now looked with ardent de&s;ire towards every po&s;t-day, came always down &s;tairs when the letter-carrier knocked at the door, to receive the new&s;paper, running with impa|tient &s;teps up &s;tairs to examine the wi&s;hed-for
<PB N="158" REF="037761_0312_100F06EB4EC645B8">
&s;heets, looked for the name of her beloved William, and found it at la&s;t&mdash;on the li&s;t of the killed.&mdash;</P>
<P>Poor, unfortunate girl! Alas, how mournfully did now her juvenile days creep along! She was deprived even of the la&s;t con&s;olation of a &s;uffering mind; &s;he dur&s;t not give vent to her tears. She was not permitted to indulge her grief, was always &s;colded when &s;he ca&s;t her mournful eyes mu&s;ing to the ground, was frequently obliged to hear the mo&s;t cruel in&s;inuations, and &s;uffer her&s;elf to be chided for di&s;gracing her noble birth by mean &s;entiments, and what was wor&s;e than this, was tormented day after day by the loath&s;ome addre&s;&s;es of the little big|bellied count.</P>
<P>Thus de&s;ponding was her &s;ituation, when the let|ter of hone&s;t Nicolaus arrived. The father was unwilling to part with his daughter; however, the mother who hoped in vain to overcome Amalia's aver&s;ion from th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> little count, availed her&s;elf joy|fully of this opportunity of getting rid of her. She called, indeed the artle&s;s Nicolaus a <HI>rude Bear,</HI> be|cau&s;e he had mentioned her &s;o bluntly by the vul|gar appellation of <HI>your Spouse,</HI> as he at lea&s;t ought to have called her <HI>her Ladyship;</HI> however, the bril|liants appea&s;ed her ire a little; &s;he dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf with the precious gift, &s;tept to the looking gla&s;s, and the tongue of the balance &s;oon inclined to Or|tenberg's &s;ide. She conde&s;cended to agree to his reque&s;t.</P>
<P>My readers will ea&s;ily conceive that Amalia was extremely glad to leave a hou&s;e where the love of her father &s;truggled in vain again&s;t his weakne&s;s, and the pride of her mother poi&s;oned all her inno|cent enjoyments, even the bitter plea&s;ure of melan|choly.</P>
<P>The treaty was &s;oon concluded. Amalia enfol|ded the knees of her father, his tears trickled down upon her hand, his ble&s;&s;ing con&s;ecrated the hour
<PB N="159" REF="037761_0313_100F06EDB3AA22A0">
of parting. The mother ki&s;&s;ed her upon her cheek, and declared that &s;he would give her her cur&s;e if ever &s;he &s;hould dare to disgrace the noble family of the Wump&s;enpump&s;es by throwing her heart away upon a plebeian. Amalia flung her&s;elf into the carriage, attended by an old meager french duenna and proceeded towards &s;witzerland.</P>
<P>The old man received her with open arms, and &s;ent the French antiquity immediately back to Han|over. He felt in a few hours benevolence for Amalia; loved her after a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ew days, and not many weeks were pa&s;&s;ed when he doated on her. She accommodated her&s;elf to all the whims and &s;ingu|larities of his old age, wept with him at Welli's urn, was &s;ilent when he was di&s;inclined to chat, read to him when he was cheerfully di&s;po&s;ed, &s;at down to the harp&s;icord and lulled him a&s;leep by her &s;oothing play. She &s;urpri&s;ed him frequently by a rural fea&s;t, &s;ummoned his tenants to partake of his bounty on the plea&s;ure ground which joined his hou&s;e, and forced him &s;ometimes to confe&s;s; that participa|ting in the plea&s;ures of others is the highe&s;t and pure&s;t bli&s;s.</P>
<P>His heart was gratefully &s;en&s;ible of what Amalia did for him, and he meditated frequently in private how he could give her &s;ome unexpected plea&s;ure, and the day on which he had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ucceed in it was to him a day of fe&s;tivity. Thus one month elap&s;ed after the other, and the rays of the ri&s;ing &s;un emerging from behind the Alps, were hailed every morn by a content, if not a hap|py couple.</P>
<P>One morning&mdash;Amalia had ju&s;t ri&s;en.&mdash;a &s;er|vant informed her a gentleman wanted to &s;peak to her. She referred him to Nicolaus; but he in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;peaking to Lady Amalia Wall her&s;elf. She went down into the parlour and beheld an officer, who pre&s;ented him&s;elf to her with mode&s;t propri|ety
<PB N="160" REF="037761_0314_100F06EFF6362898">
as Baron Waldburg. They &s;at down on the &s;ofa, conver&s;ing on different &s;ubjects; the Lieu|tenant &s;eemed di&s;tre&s;&s;ed how he &s;hould introduce the object of his vi&s;it.</P>
<P>"My Lady," began he at la&s;t, timidly, "I went in &s;earch of you to Hanover, to comply with my word of honour which I gave to a dying friend. This watch&mdash;belonged formerly to Major Orten|berg. He fell by my &s;ide and reque&s;ted me be|fore he died to deliver this watch into your own hands, and to de&s;ire you to keep it for his &s;ake.&mdash;Forgive me if I, perhaps, tear again a wound o|pen which &s;carcely is clo&s;ed.&mdash;I &s;hould have exe|cuted the la&s;t reque&s;t of my dying friend much &s;ooner, if the &s;ervice had not prevented me."</P>
<P>Amalia &s;wam in tears; &s;he pre&s;&s;ed the watch to her heart. A &s;mall &s;eal which &s;he had given Willi|am at Hanover was fixed to it. She wanted to thank the friend of her lover,&mdash;extended her hand towards him, but could not &s;peak. The idea that her name had been the la&s;t word which her dear William had uttered, filled her heart with un&s;peak|able &s;adne&s;s. Nicolaus now joined them, &s;aw the object of Amalia's tears, and could not retain his. I wi&s;h I had &s;uffered him to buy a title!" This was all he could &s;ay.</P>
<P>That day was devoted to &s;orrow. Lieutenant Waldburg &s;taid dinner, during which little was ate and le&s;s &s;poken. The full moon found them in the evening &s;itting &s;ilently at Welli's urn.</P>
<P>I now &s;hall lay down my pen. Nicolaus and Amalia are &s;till living, whether in Switzerland or at the foot of the Kauka&s;us will be indifferent to my readers. Nicolaus moi&s;tens Welli's a&s;hes with his tears, and Amalia looks frequently at William's watch, and counts every hour which brings her nearer towards the grave.</P>
