<L>He in the plot, or execution, errs.</L>
<L>For in&s;tance, does a &s;ingle &s;cene di&s;clo&s;e</L>
<L>The &s;tratagems produc'd <HI>Sophia's</HI> woes?</L>
<L>Or does the Poet paint <HI>Ly&s;ander's</HI> wiles,</L>
<L>By which, at length, her virtue be beguiles;</L>
<L>Or &s;how the noble &s;truglings of her &s;oul,</L>
<L>While gentle virtue bore &s;upreme controul,</L>
<L>Ere vice had ca&s;t its &s;hade upon the whole?</L>
<L>Had he done this, it might have taught the fair</L>
<L>Of projects &s;imilar to have been aware:</L>
<L>And when, in future, artful men had &s;trove</L>
<L>To urge them on to &s;cenes of lawle&s;s love,</L>
<L>Forewarn'd, they likewi&s;e might have been forearm'd,</L>
