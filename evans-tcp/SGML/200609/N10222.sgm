<HEAD>SOME MEMOIRS OF THE LIFE OF JOHN ROBERTS.</HEAD>
<P>_I HAVE had it on my mind, for &s;ome years pa&s;t, to commit to writing &s;ome me|morable pa&s;&s;ages, the chief of which were tran&s;acted in my time, together with &s;ome &s;hort account of our family.</P>
<P>My grandfather's name was JOHN ROBERTS, alias HAYWARD. He liv'd at a village called Siddington, within a mile of Cirence&s;ter, in Glouce&s;ter&s;hire. I have heard he lived reputably on a little e&s;tate of his own, which he occupied. He married MARY SOLLISS, &s;i&s;ter to ANDREW SOLISS, E&s;q who was in the commi&s;&s;ion of the peace, and &s;u&s;tain'd great &s;poil in the time of the civil war between king CHARLES I. and the parliament. I have heard a colonel and his men and hor&s;es quartered them&s;elves upon him a con&s;iderable time together, turn|ing their hor&s;es to the corn and hay mows.</P>
<P>My father and his next neighbour went into the army under Oliver Cromwel, and continued till they heard Cirence&s;ter was taken by the king's party; when they thought proper to return home, to &s;ee how it fared with their parents and relations.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="012986_0003_0F903DCFCF8315A8">As they were pa&s;&s;ing by Cirence&s;ter, they were di&s;co|vered and pur&s;ued by two &s;oldiers of the king's party (then in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the town.) Seeing them&s;elves pur|&s;ued, they quitted their hor&s;es, and took to their heels: but by rea&s;on of their accoutrements could make little &s;peed. They came up with my father fir&s;t; and tho' he begged for quarter, none would they give him; but laid on him with their &s;words, cutting and &s;la&s;hing his hands and arms, which he held up to &s;ave his head; as the marks upon them did long after te&s;tify. At length it plea&s;ed the Almighty to put it into his mind to fall down on his face; which he did. Hereupon the &s;oldiers being on hor&s;eback, cry'd to each other, <HI>alight, and cut his throat!</HI> But neither of them did; yet continued to &s;trike and prick him about the jaws, 'til they thought him dead. Then they left him, and pur&s;ued his neighbour, whom they pre&s;ently overtook and kill'd. Soon after they had left my father, it was &s;aid in his heart, <HI>Ri&s;e, and flee for thy life</HI>; which call he obeyed; and &s;tarting upon his feet, his enemies e&s;py'd him in motion, and pur|&s;ued him again. He ran down a &s;teep hill, and through a river, which ran at the bottom of it; tho' with ex|ceeding difficulty, his boots filling with water, and his wounds bleeding very much. They followed him to the top of the hill; but, &s;eeing he had got over, they pur|&s;ued him no further. He was at a lo&s;s which way to take in this wounded and di&s;con&s;olate condition, being &s;urrounded with enemies on every hand. At length he determined to go to his uncle Solli&s;s's; from whence he &s;ent a &s;ervant to a widow at Cirence&s;ter (at who&s;e hou&s;e the chief officers lay) with whom he was acquainted, de|&s;iring her to come to him; which &s;he readily did, and offered him all the &s;ervice in her power He de&s;ired her, as the principal officers lay at her hou&s;e, to u&s;e her in|tere&s;t with them to give command that none of the &s;ol|diers might offer him any abu&s;e. Which &s;he effected; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> in good-will to her they likewi&s;e &s;ent their able&s;t &s;ur|geon to him. He was a man of great &s;kill, but of a &s;our di&s;po&s;ition; for he told my father, <HI>if he had met him in the field, he would have kill'd him him&s;elf; but now</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>I'll
<PB N="5" REF="012986_0004_0F903DD0B6E31620">
cure you</HI>; which he did. When my father found him&s;elf able, he went to his father's hou&s;e, and found him very ill in bed. They greeted each other with many tears, and a great intermixture of joy and &s;orrow. After &s;ome time my father perceived him to tremble to &s;uch a degree, that the bed &s;hook under him. Upon which my father a&s;ked him how it was with him? He replied,
<Q>I am well. I feel no pain. 'Tis the mighty power of God that &s;hakes me.</Q>
After lying &s;till &s;ome time, he broke out in a &s;weet melody of &s;pirit, &s;aying, "In the Lord only have I righteou&s;ne&s;s and &s;trength! In God have I &s;alvation!" I don't remember to have heard he &s;aid any thing more before his departure.</P>
<P>The civil war continuing, my father found he could not be &s;afe at home; and therefore he went again, and continued till near the conclu&s;ion of that dreadful erup|tion: when he returned again to his &s;orrowful family at Siddington. After &s;ome time he took to wife Lydia Tin|dal, daughter of Thomas Tindal of Slincomb, near Dur|&s;ley, a religious family, and one of tho&s;e under the de|nomination of Puritans. Matthew Hale (afterwards lord chief ju&s;tice of England) was her kin&s;man, and drew her marriage-&s;ettlement. It plea&s;ed God to give them &s;ix children, viz. John, Jo&s;eph, Lydia, Thomas, Nathani|el, and Daniel. Jo&s;eph and Lydia died young; Thomas was kill'd at the age of fourteen, by a kick from a mare; the re&s;t lived to man's e&s;tate.</P>
<P>In the year 1665, it plea&s;ed the Lord to &s;end two women friends out of the North to Cirence&s;ter, who en|quiring after &s;uch as feared God, were directed to my fa|ther, as the likelie&s;t per&s;on to entertain them. They came to his hou&s;e, and de&s;ired a meeting. He granted it, and invited &s;everal of his acquaintance to &s;it with them. After &s;ome time of &s;ilence, the friends &s;pake a few words, which had a good effect. After the meeting, my father endeavoured to engage them in di&s;cour&s;e: but they &s;aid little, only recommended him to Richard Farn&s;worth, then a pri&s;oner for the te&s;timony of Truth in Banbury jail, to whom they were going. Upon this recommendation my father went &s;hortly after to the pri|&s;on,
<PB N="6" REF="012986_0005_0F903DD1588B95A8">
in order to conver&s;e with Richard; where he met with the two women who had been at his hou&s;e. The turnkey was denying them entrance, and telling them he had an order not to let any of tho&s;e <HI>giddy-headed people</HI> in; and therefore if they did go in, he would keep them there: But upon my father's de&s;ire they were admitted in along with him, and conducted through &s;everal rooms to a dungeon, where Richard Farn&s;worth was preaching through a grate to the people in the &s;treet; but &s;oon af|ter they came in, he de&s;i&s;ted; and, after a little time of &s;ilence, turning to them, he &s;pake to this purpo&s;e:
<Q>That Zacheus, being a man of low &s;tature, and having a mind to &s;ee Chri&s;t, ran before, and climb'd up into a &s;ycamore tree: and our Saviour, knowing his good de&s;ires, call'd to him, <HI>Zacheus, come down. This day is &s;alvation come to thy hou&s;e.</HI> Thus, Zacheus was like &s;ome in our day, who are climbing up into the tree of know|ledge, thinking to find Chri&s;t there. But the word now is, <HI>Zacheus come down, come down; for that which is to be known of God, is manife&s;ted</HI> within.</Q>
This, with more to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, was &s;poken in &s;uch authority, that, when my father came home, he told my mother he had &s;een Richard Farn&s;worth, who had &s;poke to his con|dition as if he had known him from his youth. From this time he patiently bore the cro&s;s; afterwards, when it plea&s;ed God to communicate to him a portion of the knowledge of his ble&s;&s;ed Truth, a nece&s;&s;ity was laid upon him one fir&s;t-day morning to go to the public wor&s;hip-hou&s;e in Cirence&s;ter in the time of wor&s;hip, not knowing what might be required of him there. He went, and, &s;tanding with his hat on, the prie&s;t was &s;ilent for &s;ome time: but being a&s;ked why he did not go on? he an|&s;wered, he <HI>could not, while that man &s;tood with his hat on.</HI> Upon this &s;ome took him by the arm, and led him into the &s;treet, &s;taying at the door to keep him out: but after waiting a little in &s;tillne&s;s, he &s;ound him&s;elf clear, and pa&s;&s;ed away. As he pa&s;&s;ed the market-place, the tie of his &s;hoe &s;lacken'd; and while he &s;tooped down to fa&s;ten it, a man came behind him, and &s;truck him on the back a hard blow with a &s;tone, &s;aying, <HI>There, take that for</HI> Je|&s;us
<PB N="7" REF="012986_0006_0F903DD228123D60">
Chri&s;t's <HI>&s;ake.</HI> He an&s;wered, <HI>&s;o I do</HI>; not looking back to &s;ee who it was, but quietly going his way. A few days after a man came and a&s;ked him forgivene&s;s; tell|ing him he was the unhappy man that gave him the blow on his back, and he could have no re&s;t &s;ince he had done it.</P>
<P>Not long after, three Friends came that way, who found the like concern, viz. Robert Silve&s;ter, Philip Grey, and Thomas Onyon The&s;e &s;tanding in the &s;teeple-hou&s;e with their hats on, tho' they &s;aid nothing, the prie&s;t was &s;ilent: And being a&s;ked if he was not well? he an&s;wered, he <HI>could not go forward whil&s;t tho&s;e dumb dogs &s;tood there.</HI> Wherefore the people dragged them out: and the prie&s;t afterwards informing a ju&s;tice that they had inter|rupted him in divine &s;ervice, they were bound over to the quarter-&s;e&s;&s;ions. My father, at their de&s;ire, accom|panyed them to the &s;e&s;&s;ions: and when they were called and the prie&s;t had accu&s;ed them, the bench, in a rage, without a&s;king them any que&s;tions, ordered their mitti|mus's to be made. This unju&s;t and illegal proceeding kindled my father's zeal, in&s;omuch that he &s;tepping for|ward, called to the ju&s;tices, &s;aying, <HI>Are not tho&s;e who &s;it on the bench &s;worn to do ju&s;tice? Is there not a man among you that will do the thing that is right?</HI> Whereupon John Ste|phens, of Lipeat (then chairman) cry'd out, <HI>Who are you &s;irrah? What is your name?</HI> My father telling him his name, he &s;aid, <HI>I am glad I have you here: I have heard of you: you de&s;erve a &s;tone doublet: there's many an hone&s;ter man than you hang'd. It may be &s;o,</HI> an&s;wered my father: but what do'&s;t thou think becomes of tho&s;e who hang hone&s;t men? <HI>The ju&s;tice reply'd,</HI> I'll &s;end you to pri&s;on; and if any in&s;urrection or tumult be in the land, I'll come and cut your throat fir&s;t with my own &s;word; for I fear to &s;leep in my bed, le&s;t &s;uch fanatics &s;hould come and cut my throat: and, &s;natching up a ball of wax, he violent|ly threw it at my father; who avoided the blow by &s;tep|ping a&s;ide. Their mittimus's were then made, and they were all &s;ent to pri&s;on.</P>
<P>The &s;ame evening my uncle Solli&s;s, who was one of the ju&s;tices on the bench, came to the pri&s;on, and calling for
<PB N="8" REF="012986_0007_0F903DD36EAA3A60">
my father, a&s;ked him if he was willing to have his liberty to go home to his wife and family? <HI>Upon <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">?</HI> &s;aid my father.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ju&s;tice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Upon &s;uch terms, that the jailor open the door, and let you out.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! without entering into any recog|nizance?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ju&s;tice.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I accept of my liberty. But ad|mire, uncle, how thou and &s;everal others could &s;it upon the bench as with your thumbs in your mouths, when you &s;hould &s;peak a word in behalf of the innocent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ju&s;tice.</SPEAKER>
<P>You mu&s;t learn to live under a law, cou&s;in. And if you will accept of your liberty till next &s;e&s;&s;ions, you may have it: if not, &s;tay where you are.</P>
</SP>
<P>So they parted; and on the morrow my father went home, having al&s;o the jailor's leave.</P>
<P>In the night a concern came upon him, with &s;uch weight, that it made him tremble till the bed &s;hook under him. My mother a&s;king the rea&s;on of it, he an&s;wered: <HI>The Lord requires hard things of me: if it would plea&s;e him, I had rather lay down my life than obey him in what he requires at my hands.</HI> To which my mother reply'd:
<Q>If thou art fully per&s;uaded the Lord requires it of thee, I would not have thee di&s;obey him; for he will require nothing of us but what he will enable us to go through: Therefore we have good cau&s;e to tru&s;t in him.</Q>
<HI>On which he &s;aid,</HI> I mu&s;t go to this John Stephens, who is my great enemy, and &s;ent me to pri&s;on, where he &s;aid he would &s;ecure me; and as my uncle Solli&s;s in kindne&s;s has given me leave to come home, I can expect no &s;avour from him, if I now go and run my&s;elf into the mouth of my adver&s;ary. But I mu&s;t go whatever I &s;uffer. He aro&s;e, and prepared for his journey; but dur&s;t eat or drink nothing. When he mounted his hor&s;e, the com|mand of the Lord was unto him, Remember Lot's wife: <HI>look not back.</HI> So on he rode very chearfully 8 or 9 miles, till he came within &s;ight of the ju&s;tice's hou&s;e, and then he let in the rea&s;oner, who rea&s;oned him out of all his courage, pre&s;enting to his mind, that his uncle Solli&s;s
<PB N="9" REF="012986_0008_0F903DD39B6DF518">
and his neighbours would &s;ay he had no regard for his wife and family, thus to pu&s;h him&s;elf into the hands of his greate&s;t enemy. This brought &s;uch a cloud over his mind, that he alighted off his hor&s;e, and &s;at down upon the ground, to &s;pread his cau&s;e before the Lord. After he had waited &s;ometime in &s;ilence, the Lord appeared, and di&s;&s;ipated the cloud, and his word was to him, <HI>Go, and I will go with thee, and will give thee a thre&s;hing in&s;tru|ment, and thou &s;halt thre&s;h the mountains.</HI> Now he was ex|ceedingly overcome with the love of God: and I have often heard him &s;ay, he was filled like a ve&s;&s;el that want|ed vent, and &s;aid in his heart, <HI>Thy pre&s;ence is enough,</HI> pro|ceeding to the hou&s;e with great &s;atisfaction. It being pretty early in the morning, and &s;eeing the &s;table door open, he went to the groom, and de&s;ired him to put up his hor&s;e. While this was doing, the ju&s;tice's &s;on and his clerk came up, the latter roughly &s;aid "I thought you had been in Glouce&s;ter ca&s;tle."</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>So I was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clerk.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how came you out?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>When thou ha&s;t authority to demand it, I can give thee an an&s;wer. But my bu&s;ine&s;s is with thy ma&s;ter, if I may &s;peak with him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clerk.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may, if you'll promi&s;e to be civil.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>If thou &s;ee&s;t me uncivil, I de&s;ire thee to tell me of it.</P>
</SP>
<P>They went in; and my father following them, they bid him take a turn in the hall, and they would acquaint the ju&s;tice of his being there. He was &s;oon called in; and my father no &s;ooner &s;aw him, but he believed the Lord had been at work upon him: for, as he had be|haved to him with the fiercene&s;s of a lion before, he now appeared like a lamb, meeting him with a plea&s;ant coun|tenance, and, taking him by the hand, &s;aid, "Friend Haywood, how do you do&punc;" My father an&s;wered, <HI>pretty well;</HI> and then proceeded thus; <HI>I am come in the fear and dread of heaven, to warn thee to repent of thy wickedne&s;s with &s;peed, le&s;t the Lord cut the thread of thy life, and &s;end thee to the pit that is bottomle&s;s. I am come to warn thee, in great love, whether thou wilt hear or forbear, and to preach the ever|la&s;ting
<PB N="10" REF="012986_0009_0F903DD448343840">
Go&s;pel to thee.</HI> The ju&s;tice reply'd,
<Q>You are a welcome me&s;&s;enger to me, that is what I have long de&s;ired to hear.</Q>
<HI>The everla&s;ting Go&s;pel</HI> (returned my father) <HI>is the &s;ame that God &s;ent his &s;ervant</HI> John <HI>to declare, when he &s;aw an angel flying through the mid&s;t of heaven, &s;aying with a loud voice,</HI>
<Q>Fear God, and give glory to his name, and wor&s;hip him who made heaven and earth, the &s;ea, and the fountains of water.</Q>
The ju&s;tice then cau&s;ed my father to &s;it down by him on a couch; and &s;aid,
<Q>I believe your me&s;&s;age is of God, and I receive it as &s;uch. I am &s;orry I have done you wrong: and I will never wrong you more. I would pray you to forgive me, and to pray to God to forgive me.</Q>
After much more di&s;cour&s;e, he offered my father the be&s;t entertain|ment his hou&s;e afforded; but my father excu&s;ed him&s;elf from eating or drinking with him at that time, expre&s;&s;|ing his kind acceptance of his love; and &s;o in much love they parted.</P>
<P>The &s;ame day William Dew&s;berry had appointed a meeting at Tedbury; whither my mother went. But &s;he was &s;o concerned on account of my father's exerci&s;e, that &s;he could receive little benefit from the meeting. After the meeting was ended, William Dew&s;berry walk'd to and fro in a long pa&s;&s;age, groaning in &s;pirit; and by and by came up to my mother, and, tho' &s;he was a &s;tranger to him, he laid his hand upon her head, and &s;aid. "Woman thy &s;orrow is great: I &s;orrow with thee." Then walking a little to and fro, as before, he came to her again, and &s;aid,
<Q>Now the time is come, <HI>that the&s;e who marry, mu&s;t be as tho' they married not, and tho&s;e who have hu&s;bands, as though they had none;</HI> for the Lord calls for all to be offered up.</Q>
By this &s;he &s;aw the Lord had given him a &s;en&s;e of her great burthen; for &s;he had not di&s;covered her exerci&s;e to any: And it gave her &s;uch ea&s;e in her mind, that &s;he went home rejoicing in the Lord. She no &s;ooner got home, but &s;he found my fa|ther returned from Lypeat, where his me&s;&s;age was re|ceived in &s;uch love, as was far from their expectation; the &s;en&s;e of which brake them into tears, in con&s;iderati|tion
<PB N="11" REF="012986_0010_0F903DD507875A58">
of the great goodne&s;s of God, in &s;o eminently mak|ing way for, and helping them that day.</P>
<P>At the next &s;e&s;&s;ions my father and the three Friends appeared in court; where, as &s;oon as ju&s;tice Stephens e&s;py'd them, he called to my father, and &s;aid,
<Q>John, I accept of your appearance, and di&s;charge you, and the court di&s;charges. You may go about your bu&s;i|ne&s;s.</Q>
But my father thinking his work not done, did not ha&s;ten out of court. Upon which the clerk demand|ed his fees. <HI>What! do&s;t mean money?</HI> &s;ays my father. "Yes: what do you think I mean?" &s;ays the clerk. My father reply'd, <HI>I don't know that I owe any man here any thing but love, and mu&s;t I now purcha&s;e my liberty with money? I don't accept it on &s;uch terms.</HI></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clerk (to the chairman.)</SPEAKER>
<P>An't plea&s;e your wor&s;hip, John won't pay the fees of the court.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>I don't accept my liberty on &s;uch terms.</P>
</SP>
<P>Then he was ordered to pri&s;on with the three friends. But in the evening the clerk di&s;charged them, and ever after carried him&s;elf very kindly to my father.</P>
<P>He was afterwards ca&s;t into pri&s;on at Cirence&s;ter, by George Bull, vicar of Upper-Siddington, for tythes. Where was confined at the &s;ame time, upon the &s;ame account, Elizabeth Hewlings, a widow of Amney, near Cirence&s;ter. She was a good chri&s;tian, and &s;o good a midwife that her confinement was a lo&s;s to that &s;ide of the country; in&s;omuch, that lady Dunch, of Down-Amney, thought it would be an act of charity to the neighbourhood to purcha&s;e her liberty, by paying the prie&s;t's demand; which &s;he did. She likewi&s;e came to Cirence&s;ter in a coach, and &s;ent her footman Alexander Cornwall, to the pri&s;on to bring Elizabeth to her. And while Elizabeth was making ready to go with the man, my father and he fell into a little di&s;cour&s;e. He a&s;ked my father his name, and where his home was; which when my father had told him.
<Q>What! (&s;aid he) are you that John Haywood of Siddington, who keeps great conventicles at your hou&s;e?</Q>
My father an&s;wered, <HI>The church of Chri&s;t often meets at my hou&s;e. I &s;uppo&s;e I am the man thou meane&s;t.</HI>
<Q>I have often (replyed Cornwall)
<PB N="12" REF="012986_0011_0F903DD62E7A21E0">
heard my lady &s;peak of you, and I am &s;ure &s;he would gladly be acquainted with you.</Q>
When he returned to his lady, he told her he had met with &s;uch a man in the pri&s;on as he believed &s;he would not &s;uffer to lie in pri&s;on for con&s;cience-&s;ake; informing her withal who he was. She immediately bid him to go back and fetch him to her. Accordingly he came to the jail, and told my fa|ther his lady wanted to &s;peak with him. My father an|&s;wered, <HI>If any body would &s;peak with me, they mu&s;t come where I am; for I am a pri&s;oner.</HI>
<Q>Oh (&s;aid Cornwall) I'll get leave of the jailor for you to go.</Q>
Which he did. And when they came before the lady, &s;he put on a ma|je&s;tic air, to &s;ee how the Quaker would greet her. He went up towards her, and bluntly &s;aid, <HI>Woman, would&s;t thou &s;peak with me.</HI></P>

<P>Becau&s;e, for con&s;cience-&s;ake, I cant't pay an hireling prie&s;t what he demands of me; therefore he, like the fal&s;e prophets of old, prepares war again&s;t me, becau&s;e I can't put into his mouth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>By what I have heard of you, I took you to be a wi&s;e man, and if you could not pay him your&s;elf, you might let &s;omebody el&s;e pay him for you.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>That would be underhand dealing, and I had rather pay him my&s;elf, than be &s;uch a hypocrite.</P>

<P>According to his appointment, my father went; and found her very inqui&s;itive about the things of God, and very attentive to the truths he delivered. She engaged him likewi&s;e a &s;econd time&punc; and treated him with a|bundance of regard. A third time &s;he bid her man Cornwall to go to him and de&s;ire him to appoint a day when he would pay her another vi&s;it: and then ordered him to go to the prie&s;t Carele&s;s, of Cirence&s;ter, and de&s;ire him to come and take a dinner with her at the &s;ame time; and not let either of them know the other
<PB N="14" REF="012986_0013_0F903DDBA1976D20">
was to be there. On the day appointed my father went; and when he had got within &s;ight of her hou&s;e, he heard a hor&s;e behind him, and looking back, he &s;aw the prie&s;t following him which made him conclude the lady had projected to bring them together. When the prie&s;t came up to him, "Well overtaken, John (&s;aid he) how far are you going this way?" My father an&s;wered
<Q><HI>I believe we are both going to the &s;ame places</HI> What! (&s;aid Carele&s;s) are you going to the great hou&s;e?</Q>
Yes, &s;aid my father. "Come on then John," &s;aid he. So then they went in together. And the lady being ill in bed, a &s;ervant went up and informed her they were come. "What! (&s;aid &s;he) did they come together?" Yes an&s;wered the &s;ervant.
<Q>I admire at that (&s;aid &s;he). But do you beckon John out&punc; and bring him to me fir&s;t up the back &s;tairs.</Q>
When my father came up, &s;he told him &s;he had been very ill in a fit of the &s;tone, and &s;aid, "I have heard you have done good in many di&s;tempers.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confe&s;s I have; but to this of the &s;tone I am a &s;tranger. Indeed I once knew a man, who lived at ea&s;e, and fared delicately, as thou may'&s;t do, and whil&s;t he continued in that practice he was much afflicted with that di&s;temper. But it plea&s;ed the Lord to vi&s;it him with the knowledge of his ble&s;&s;ed truth, which brought him to a more regular and temperate life, and this pre&s;erved him more free from it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! I know what you aim at. You want to have me a Quaker. And I confe&s;s, if I could be &s;uch an one as you are, I would be a Quaker tomorrow.&mdash; But I under&s;tand Mr Carele&s;s is below; and tho' you are men of different per&s;ua&s;ions, I account you both wi&s;e and godly men, and &s;ome moderate di&s;cour&s;e of the things of God between you, I believe would do me good.</P>

And if thou can&s;t prove me a Pa|pi&s;t in one thing, with the help of God I'll prove thee like them in ten. And this woman who lies here in bed, &s;hall be judge.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>The Quakers hold that damnable doctrine, and dangerous tenet, of perfection in this life; and &s;o do the Papi&s;ts. If you go about to deny it John, I can prove you hold it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>I doubt thou art now going about to be|lie the Papi&s;ts behind their backs, as thou ha&s;t heretofore done by us. For, by what I have learnt of their prin|ciples, they do not believe a &s;tate of freedom from &s;in and acceptance with God po&s;&s;ible on this &s;ide the grave; and therefore they have imagined to them&s;elves a place of purgation after death. But whether they believe &s;uch a &s;tate attainable or no, I do.</P>

<P>And my father car|ried it to a month or two; and &s;o gradually till he brought it to &s;even years, the prie&s;t confe&s;&s;ing he believ|ed the &s;ame. On which my father thus proceeded:
<Q>How could'&s;t thou accu&s;e me of popery, in holding this doctrine, which thou thy&s;elf ha&s;t confe&s;&s;ed too? If I am like a Papi&s;t, thou art, by thy own confe&s;&s;ion, as like a Papi&s;t as I am. And if it be a damnable doc|trine and dangerous tenet in the Quakers, is it not the
<PB N="17" REF="012986_0016_0F903DDEE85A17E8">
&s;ame in thy&s;elf? Thou told'&s;t me I mi&s;took thee; but ha&s;t not thou mi&s;taken thy&s;elf in condemning thine own acknowledged opinion when uttered by me? But notwith&s;tanding thou ha&s;t &s;ail'd in making me out to be a Papi&s;t in this particular, can'&s;t thou do it in any thing el&s;e?</Q>
Upon this the prie&s;t being mute, my fa|ther thus proceeded:
<Q>Well! tho' thou ha&s;t fail'd in proving me like them, it need not hinder me from &s;hewing thee to be &s;o in many things. For in&s;tance, you build hou&s;es and con&s;ecrate them, calling them churches; as do the Papi&s;ts. You hang bells in 'em, and con&s;ecrate 'em, calling them by the names of &s;aints; &s;o do they. The Pope and the prie&s;ts of the Roman church wear &s;urplices, gowns, ca&s;&s;ocks, &amp;c. calling them their ornaments; here thou ha&s;t the like; and do'&s;t thou not &s;tile them thy ornaments? You con&s;ecrate the ground where you inter your dead, calling it holy ground; &s;o do they. In &s;hort, thou art like a Papi&s;t in &s;o many things, he need be a wi&s;e man to di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt them and thee.</Q></P>
<P>At this the prie&s;t appeared unea&s;y; and &s;aid to the lady,
<Q>Madam, I mu&s;t beg your excu&s;e; for there's to be a lecture this afternoon, and I mu&s;t be there.</Q>
She pre&s;t him to &s;tay to dinner, but he earne&s;tly de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed. So a &s;lice or two being cut off of the &s;pit, he eat, and took his leave.</P>
<P>The lady then &s;aid to my father, had &s;he not &s;een it, &s;he could not have believed Mr. Carele&s;s could have been &s;o foil'd in di&s;cour&s;e by any man; for, &s;aid &s;he, I ac|counted him as &s;ound and orthodox a divine as any was; but now I mu&s;t tell you, I am &s;o far of your opinion, that if you'll let me know when you have a meeting at your hou&s;e, and &s;omebody to preach, (not a &s;ilent meet|ing) I'll come and hear 'em my&s;elf. My father an&s;wered, he expected &s;he would be as good as her word. Not long after came two friends to my father's hou&s;e, and tho' the weather was very &s;evere, he found he could not be ea&s;y without acquainting her with it. So he went to her hou&s;e, but &s;he &s;eem'd a little &s;urpriz'd &s;ay|ing "What's your will now, John?" He informed
<PB N="18" REF="012986_0017_0F903DDF8D233090">
her of the two friends, and their intention of having a meeting at his hou&s;e.
<Q>How can you expect (&s;aid &s;he) I &s;hould go out &s;uch weather as this? You know I &s;eldom &s;tir out of my chamber, and to go &s;o far may endanger my health.</Q>
My father re|turn'd,
<Q>I would not have thee make excu&s;es, as &s;ome of old did, and were not found worthy. Thou knowe&s;t time is none of ours, and we know not whether we may have the like opportunity again. The &s;now need not much incommode thee: thou may&s;t be quick|ly in thy coach, and, putting up the gla&s;&s;es, may'&s;t be pretty warm; and when thou come&s;t to my hou&s;e, I know my wife will do her be&s;t for thee.</Q>
So &s;he or|dered her coach and fix to be got ready (for the di&s;|tance was &s;even miles) &s;aying, "John's like death, he'll not be deny'd." My father came along with her; and during the time of &s;ilence in the meeting, &s;he appear'd &s;omething re&s;tle&s;s; but was very attentive whil&s;t either of the friends were &s;peaking. She was very well plea&s;ed after the meeting, and &s;at at table with the friends. While the re&s;t &s;at &s;ilent, &s;he would be frequently whi&s;|pering to my mother, till one of them &s;pake a few words before meat. She was a&s;ham'd, and told my mother, when &s;he was among the great, &s;he was accounted a wi&s;e woman; but now (&s;aid &s;he) I am among you Qua|kers, I am a very fool. Pre&s;ently after dinner &s;he re|turn'd home, and came &s;everal times to the meeting afterwards; and I am fully per&s;uaded &s;he was convinced of the truth; but going up to London, &s;he was there taken ill, and died.</P>
<P>Her man Alexander Cornwall, was convinced of the truth, and was afterwards a pri&s;oner with my father in Glouce&s;ter ca&s;tle; where the jailor was very cruel to them, &s;ometimes putting them into the common jail a|mong &s;elons, and other times he would hire a tinker (who lay for his fees) to trouble them in the night by playing on his hautboy. One time in particular my father being concerned to &s;peak to him in the dread and power of God, it &s;truck him to &s;uch a degree, that he dropt the in&s;trument out of his hand, and would ne|ver
<PB N="19" REF="012986_0018_0F903DE04FE7CED0">
take it into hand upon that occa&s;ion any more. When the jailor a&s;k'd him why he di&s;continued it, he an&s;wered,
<Q>They are the &s;ervants of the living God, and I'll ne|ver play more to di&s;turb them, if you hang me up at the door for it,</Q>
<Q>What! (&s;aid the jailor) are you bewitch'd too. I'll turn you out of the ca&s;tle.</Q>
Which he did; and the friends who were there pri&s;oners rais'd him &s;ome money, cloath'd him, and away he went.</P>
<P>Some time after my father had three conferences with &mdash; Nichol&s;on, bi&s;hop of Glouce&s;ter, introduced in the following manner. An apparitor came to cite my father to appear at the bi&s;hop's court: but he told my father he could not encourage him to come, le&s;t they &s;hould en&s;nare him, and &s;end him to pri&s;on. At the &s;ame time they cited a &s;ervant of my father's named John Overall. My father went at the time appointed, without his &s;ervant: and when his name was call'd over, he an&s;wered to it. The di&s;cour&s;e that occurr'd was in &s;ub&s;tance as follows: &mdash;</P>

<P>My lord, he keeps meetings at his hou&s;e, and he calls that a church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; I no more believe my hou&s;e to be a church, than I believe what you call &s;o to be one. I call the people of God the church of God, where&s;oever they are met to wor&s;hip him in &s;pirit and in truth. And when I &s;ay the church comes to me, I mean the a&s;&s;em|bly of &s;uch wor&s;hippers, who frequently meet at my hou&s;e. I do not call that a church which you do, which is made of wood and &s;tone, that is but the work|man&s;hip of men's hands, whereas the true church con|&s;i&s;ts of living &s;tones, and is built up by Chri&s;t a &s;piritual hou&s;e to God.</P>

<SPEAKER>Bi&s;hop.</SPEAKER>
<P>We call it a church figuratively, meaning the place where the church meets.</P>

<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fear you call it a church hypocritically and deceitfully, with de&s;ign to awe the people into a ve|neration for the place, which is not due to it, as tho' your con&s;ecrations had made that hou&s;e holier than others.</P>

<P>Then a Bapti&s;t preacher was called, who &s;eeing the bi&s;hop's civility to my father, in &s;uffering him to keep on his hat, thought to take the &s;ame liberty. At whom the bi&s;hop put on a &s;tern countenance, and &s;aid,

of his maje&s;ty and his court, with your hat on? I confe&s;s there are &s;ome men in the world who make a con&s;cience of putting off their hats, to whom we ought to have &s;ome regard. But for you, who can put it off to every mechanic you meet, to come here, in contempt of authority, with it on, I'll a&s;&s;ure you, friend, you &s;hall &s;peed never the better for it.</Q>
&mdash; I heard my father &s;ay, the&s;e words came &s;o hone&s;tly from the bi&s;hop, that it did him good to hear him.&mdash;The Bap|ti&s;t then taking off his hat, &s;aid,

<SPEAKER>Bi&s;hop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you have got a cap on; nay you have two caps on. (He had a black one over a white one.) What is your rea&s;on for denying your children that holy ordinance of bapti&s;m.</P>

<P>No, my lord.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bi&s;hop.</SPEAKER>
<P>I thought &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<P>Then telling how and where he might get it, he gave him a &s;pace of time to peru&s;e it; and told him if that would not &s;atisfy him, to come to him, and he would give him full &s;atisfaction.&mdash;Some time after the bi&s;hop &s;ent his bailiff to take my father: but he was then gone to Bri&s;tol with George Fox. The officers came &s;everal times and &s;earched the hou&s;e for him, pretending they only wanted him for a &s;mall tre&s;|pa&s;s, which would &s;oon be made up, if they could &s;ee him. My mother an&s;wered &s;he didn't believe any neigh|bour he had would trouble him upon &s;uch an account; for if by chance any of his cattle tre&s;pa&s;s'd upon any, he would readily make 'em &s;atisfaction, without further trouble. Which they very well knew. However, &s;he always treated them civilly, and frequently &s;et meat and drink before 'em. My father &s;taying away longer than was expected, they imagin'd he ab&s;conded for fear of 'em; and therefore offered my mother, if &s;he would give them twenty &s;hillings, to let him come home for a month.
<PB N="24" REF="012986_0023_0F903DE407688F88">
But &s;he told them &s;he knew of no wrong he had done to any man, and therefore would give 'em no money; for that would imply a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt.
<Q>But (&s;aid &s;he) if my enemy hunger, I can feed him; and if he thir&s;t. I can give him drink.</Q>
Upon this they flew into a rage, and &s;aid, they would have him if he were above ground; for none could pardon him but the king. My father returning home thro' Tedbury, was there in|formed that the bailiffs had been about his hou&s;e almo&s;t ever &s;ince he went from home. He therefore contrived to come home after day-light; when he came into his own grounds, the moon &s;hining bright, he &s;py'd the &s;hadow of a man, and a&s;k'd, who's there? "It is I," &s;ays the man.</P>

<P>No, ma&s;ter: I might; but I would not meddle: I have wrong'd you enough already: God forgive me. But tho&s;e who now lie in wait for you are the Paytons, my lord bi&s;hop's bailiffs. I would not have you fall into their hands, for they are mercile&s;s rogues I would have you, ma&s;ter, take my coun&s;el: ever while you live plea&s;e a knave, for an hone&s;t man won't hurt you.</P>
</SP>
<P>My father came home, and de&s;ired us not to let the bailiffs in upon him that night, that he might have an opportunity of taking coun&s;el on his pillow. In the morning he told my mother what he had &s;een that night in a vi&s;ion.
<Q>I thought (&s;aid he) I was walking a fine plea&s;ant green way; but it was narrow, and had a wall an each &s;ide of it. In my way lay &s;omething like a bear, but more dreadful. The &s;ight of him put me to a &s;tand. A man &s;eeing me &s;urprized, came to me with a &s;miling countenance, and &s;aid, <HI>Why art tho afraid, friend? he is chain'd, and can't hurt thee.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> thought I made an&s;wer, <HI>The way is &s;o narrow, I can pa&s;s by but he may reach me.

will, and thought his face &s;hone like the face of an angel. Upon which I took courage, and &s;tepping forward, laid my hand upon his head.</Q>
The con|&s;truction he made of this to my mother was: <HI>Truth is a narrow way; and this bi&s;hop lies in my way; I mu&s;t go to him, whatever I &s;uffer.</HI> So he aro&s;e, and &s;et forward, and call|ed upon Amariah Drewett, a friend of Cirence&s;ter, to accompany him. When they came to the bi&s;hop's hou&s;e at Cleve, near Glouce&s;ter, they found a butcher's wife of Cirence&s;ter, who was come to intercede for her hu&s;|band, who was put into the bi&s;hop's court for killing meat on fir&s;t-days. Two young &s;parks of the bi&s;hop's attendance, were a&s;king her if &s;he knew John Haywood? She an&s;wered, "Yes, very well." <Q>What is he for a man?</Q>
&s;aid they. <HI>A very good man,</HI> (&s;aid &s;he) <HI>&s;etting a&s;ide his religion: but I have nothing to &s;ay to that.</HI> One of them &s;aid he'd give five &s;hillings to &s;ee him; the other offer'd eight. Upon which my father &s;tepp'd up to them; but they &s;aid not one word to him. One of them pre&s;ently informed the bi&s;hop he was come. Whereup|on the bi&s;hop di&s;mi&s;s'd his company, and had him up &s;tairs. My father found him &s;eated in his chair, with his hat under his arm, a&s;&s;uming a maje&s;tic air. My fa|ther &s;tood &s;ilent a while; and &s;eeing the bi&s;hop didn't begin with him, he approached nearer, and thus acco&s;t|ed him: "Old man my bu&s;ine&s;s is with thee."</P>

<P>I have heard thou ha&s;t &s;ent out thy bai|liffs to take me: but I rather cho&s;e to come my&s;elf, to know what wrong I have done thee.

<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our &s;ubjection to laws is either active or pa&s;&s;ive. So that if a man can't, for con&s;cience-&s;ake, do the thing the law requires, but pa&s;&s;ively &s;uffers what the law inflicts, the law, I conceive, is as fully an&s;wered as if he had actually obeyed.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>None at all. But tho' it is no re&s;tituti|on to the owner, yet the law is &s;atisfied. Tho' the owner be a lo&s;er, the criminal has &s;uffered the puni&s;h|ment the law inflicts, as an equivalent for the crime committed.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and I'll tell thee plainly, 'tis high time wi&s;er men were cho&s;en, to make better laws. For if this thief was taken and &s;old for a proper term, ac|cording to the law of Mo&s;es, and the owner had four oxen for his ox, and four &s;heep for his &s;heep, he would be &s;atisfied, and the man's life pre&s;erved, that he might repent, and amend his ways.&mdash;But! hope thou do&s;t not accu&s;e me of having &s;tole any man's ox or a&s;s.</P>

There were two or three prie&s;ts indeed, who &s;tood hone&s;tly to their principles, and &s;uffered pretty much; but the far greater number turn'd with the tide: and we have rea|&s;on to believe, that if Oliver would have put ma&s;s into their mouths, they would have conformed even to that for their bellies.</P>

<P>Our religion, as thou may'&s;t read in the &s;cripture (John iv.) was &s;et up by Chri&s;t him&s;elf, be|tween &s;ixteen and &s;eventeen hundred years ago: and he had full power to e&s;tabli&s;h the true religion in his church, when he told the woman of Samaria, that neither at that mountain, nor yet at Jeru&s;alem, was the place of true wor&s;hip. They wor&s;hip they knew not what. For, &s;aid he, God is a Spirit, <HI>and they that wor&s;hip him mu&s;t wor&s;hip him in Spirit and in truth.</HI> This is our religion, and hath ever been the religion of all tho&s;e who have wor&s;hipped God ac|ceptably thro' the &s;everal ages &s;ince down to this time; and will be the religion of the true &s;piritual wor&s;hippers

of God to the world's end; a religion perform'd by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;pirit of God, becau&s;e God is a &s;pirit; a religion e&s;tabli&s;h'd by Chri&s;t him&s;elf before the ma&s;s|book, &s;ervice-book, or directory, or any of tho&s;e inven|tions and traditions of men, which in the night of a|po&s;tacy were &s;et up.</P>

<SPEAKER>John Roberts.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe according to the &s;cripture, that <HI>there are Three that bear record in heaven,</HI> and that <HI>tho&s;e Three are One:</HI> thou may'&s;t make as many per&s;ons of them as thou can&s;t. But I would &s;oberly a&s;k thee, &s;ince the &s;criptures &s;ay the heaven of heavens cannot contain him, and that he is incomprehen&s;ible, by what per&s;on or likene&s;s can&s;t thou comprehend the Almighty?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Bi&s;hop.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yours is the &s;trange&s;t of all per&s;ua&s;ions: For tho' there are many &s;ects (which he named) and tho' they and we differ in &s;ome circum&s;tances, yet in fun|damentals we agree as one. But I ob&s;erve, you of all others, &s;trike at the very root and ba&s;is of our religion.</P>

<P>I am glad of that; for the root is the rottenne&s;s, and truth &s;trikes at the very foundation there|of. That little &s;tone which Daniel &s;aw cut out of the moun|tain without hands will overturn all in God's due time, when you have done all you can to &s;upport it But, as to tho&s;e others thou mention'&s;t, there is &s;o little difference between you, that wi&s;e men wonder why you differ at all; only we read, <HI>the bea&s;t had many heads and many horns, which pu&s;h again&s;t each other.</HI> And yet I am fully per&s;waded, there are many in this day true &s;piritual wor&s;hippers in all per|&s;ua&s;ions.</P>

<P>Why, you will give a carpenter leave to call his gimblet a gimblet, and his gouge a gouge; but you call our church a ma&s;s-hou&s;e.</P>

<P>I would not upbraid you; but I'll en|deavour to &s;hew thee wherein you fall &s;hort of carpenters. Suppo&s;e I had a &s;on intended to learn the trade of a carpenter; I indent with an hone&s;t man of that calling, in con&s;ideration of &s;o much money, to teach my &s;on his trade in &s;uch a term of years; at the end of which term my &s;on may be as good, or perhaps a better workman than his ma&s;ter, and he &s;hall be at liberty from him to follow the bu&s;ine&s;s for him&s;elf. Now will you be &s;o hone&s;t as this carpenter? You are men who pretend to know more of light, life, and &s;alvation, and things pertaining to the kingdom of heaven, than we do: I would a&s;k in how long a time you would undertake to teach us as much as you know? and what &s;hall we give you, that we may be once free from our ma&s;ters? But here you keep us always learning, that he may be al|ways paying you. Plainly 'tis a very cheat. What! always, learning and never able to come to the knowledge of God! mi&s;erable &s;inners you found us, and mi&s;erable &s;inners you leave us.</P>

<P>After &s;ome more di&s;cour&s;e, my father told him time was far &s;pent; and &s;aid, "It nothing will &s;erve thee but my body in a pri&s;on, here it is in thy power, and if thou commande&s;t me to deliver my&s;elf up either to the &s;heriff, or to the jailor of Glouce&s;ter ca&s;tle, as thy pri&s;oner, I will go, and &s;eek no other judge, advocate, or attor|ney to plead my cau&s;e, but the great judge of heaven and earth, who knows I have nothing but love and good-will in my heart to thee and all mankind."</P>

<P>I had a poor neighbour, who had a wife and &s;ix children, and whom the chief men about us permitted to keep &s;ix or &s;even cows upon the wa&s;te, which were the principal &s;upport of his family, and pre&s;erv'd 'em from becoming chargeable to the pari&s;h. One very &s;tormy night the cattle were left in the yard, as u&s;ual; but could not be found in the morning. The man and his &s;ons had &s;ought 'em to no purpo&s;e: and after they had been lo&s;t four days, his wife came to me, and in a great deal of grief, cry'd, O Lord! ma&s;ter Haywood, we are undone! my hu&s;band and I mu&s;t go a begging in our old age! we have lo&s;t all our cows! my hu&s;band and the boys have been round the country, and can hear nothing of them, I'll down on my bare knees if you'll &s;tand our friend? I de&s;ired &s;he would not be in &s;uch an a|gony, and told her &s;he &s;hould not down on her knees to me; but I would gladly help them in what I could. I know, &s;aid &s;he, you are a good man, and God will

Her faith being &s;o &s;trong, brought the greater exerci&s;e upon me, with &s;trong cries unto the Lord, that he would be plea&s;ed to make me in&s;trumental in his hand, for the help of the poor family. In the morning early comes the old man, <HI>In the name of God,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>which way &s;hall we go and &s;eek them</HI>? I being deeply concerned in my mind, did not an&s;wer him till he had thrice repeated it; and then I an&s;wered, "In the name of God we will go to &s;eek them (and &s;aid before I was aware) we will go to Malmsbury, and at the hor&s;e-fair we &s;hall find them" When I had &s;poken the words I was much troubled le&s;t they &s;hould not prove true. It was very early, and the fir&s;t man we &s;aw, I a&s;ked him if he had &s;een any &s;tray milch cows there abouts? <HI>What manner of cattle are they</HI>? &s;aid he. And the old man de|&s;cribing of their marks and number, he told us there were &s;ome &s;tood chewing their cuds in their hor&s;e-fair: but thinking they belonged to &s;ome of the neighbour|hood, he did not take particular notice of them. When we came to the place, the old man found 'em to be his; but &s;uffered his tran&s;ports of joy to ri&s;e &s;o high, that I was a&s;hamed of his behaviour; for he fell a hollowing, and threw up his mountier cap in the air &s;everal times, 'till he rai&s;ed the neighbours out of their beds to &s;ee what was matter. <HI>O</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>I had lo&s;t my cows four or five days ago, and thought I &s;hould never &s;ee them again; and this hone&s;t neigh|bour of mine, told me this morning by his own fire &s;ide, nine miles off, that here I &s;hould them find, and here I have them</HI>! Then up goes his cap again. I begged of the poor man to be quiet, and take his cows home, and be thank|ful, as indeed I was, being reverently bowed in my &s;pirit before the Lord, in that he was plea&s;ed to put the words of truth into my mouth. And the man drove his cattle home, to the great joy of his family.</P>

<P>That jailor had been very cruel to me, and the re&s;t of our friends, who were then pri&s;oners.

At length I found means, at a&s;&s;ize time, to acquaint the judge (by letter) of his illegal proceedings. In con&s;equence of which we were ordered to be put on the Kalender, had a hear|ing, and were acquitted. The judge &s;everely repri|manded the jailor, &s;aying, "Sirrah! if ever I hear that you do the like for the future, I'll take care that you &s;hall be jailor here no longer. Shall I come here to hear and determine cau&s;es, and &s;hall you keep men in pri&s;on during your plea&s;ure, and not put their names in the Kalender"? The jailor coming out of the ca&s;tle was heard by the turnkey to &s;ay, "It was about Haywood that I was &s;o &s;everely reprimanded by the judge; and if ever he comes into the ca&s;tle again, he &s;hall never come out alive." Upon which the turnkey took an opportunity to find me out, and informing me of it, &s;aid, "I would not have you by any means come
<PB N="45" REF="012986_0044_0F903DFF07B71518">
back to the ca&s;tle to night, to fetch any of your things; for if you do, he'll certainly detain you for his &s;ees. I'll take care of your thing <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> if your&s;elf were pre&s;ent to do it." I acknowledged his kindne&s;s, and went home. When the jailor return'd to the ca&s;tle, he a&s;k'd the turnkey where the Quakers were? He an&s;wer'd, he thought it his bu&s;i|ne&s;s to take care of the felons, and to leave the Quakers to him. Not long after, being con&s;table, I &s;ecur'd a felon who broke out of the ca&s;tle, and &s;ent the turnkey notice of it. He coming over to fetch him back, begg'd if by any means I could prevent it, that I would not come any more a pri&s;oner to the ca&s;tle whil&s;t his ma&s;ter was jailor. "For (&s;ays he) if you do, he &s;wears you &s;hall never go out alive; and that hour you come in I leave the ca&s;tle; for I can't &s;tay there to &s;ee you abu&s;ed." Does he &s;till &s;ay &s;o? &s;aid I. Yes, he does, &s;aid he, "Then remember me to him (&s;aid I) and tell him from me I &s;hall never &s;ee his face any more! Soon after it plea|&s;ed God to take him away by death; and in a little time I was had pri&s;oner there again.</P>

<P>With &s;ome pains he got all the friends out, of the hou&s;e and order'd all the forms to be brought out into the &s;treet.</P>
<P>Which being done, my father &s;aid, "The &s;eats are our own, and we may as well &s;it as &s;tand." So the friends &s;at down: but pre&s;ently after they were broken up and di&s;pers'd.&mdash;Not long after John Timbrel, a friend of Cirence&s;ter, wrote to ju&s;tice Burcher, and told him (among&s;t other things) he had till then a better opinion of him than to think he would &s;et his hand to &s;uch a work; and that he was &s;orry that he &s;hould be one in it. Sir John, being acquainted with it by ju&s;tice Burcher, &s;ent out a warrant again&s;t John Timbrel. The con&s;table who had it to &s;erve was &s;o civil to inform him of it, and tell him he would not &s;erve it on him till his market was over.

<P>Some time ago, &s;everal of my friends being met, together with me in a peaceable manner, to wor&s;hip God, at Stoke Orchard, thy father came in with a file of mu&s;quetiers at his heels, and beat and abus'd us very much. I then warn'd him in abundance of love. Yet he did not &s;eem to regard it, but &s;ent about twelve of us to Glouce&s;ter ca&s;tle. I then told him God would plead our cau&s;e with him. And I was credibly inform'd that, not the very night, but the next night after, he went to bed as well in appearance as u&s;ual; but in the morn|ing, he not ringing a certain bell, which he had by him for that purpo&s;e, at the time he us'd to do, his hou&s;ekeeper went up &s;everal times, and thought he was a&s;leep. But at length, &s;u&s;pecting &s;omething more than ordinary, &s;he made a clo&s;er in&s;pection; and, perceiving his countenance chang'd, &s;he threw open the curtains in a great &s;urpri&s;e. On which, he ju&s;t fla&s;h'd open his eyes, but &s;aid not a word. She a&s;k'd him how he did? but he made no an|&s;wer. Which made her cry out more earne&s;tly; "Pray &s;ir, how do you do? How is it with you? For God's &s;ake tell me." And all he &s;aid to her was Oh the&s;e Quak|ers! Oh the&s;e Quakers! Would to God I never had a hand again&s;t the Quakers! I did not hear that ever he &s;poke more</P>
<P>Sir John &s;eem'd &s;urpri&s;ed at this relation, and did not contradict it in the lea&s;t; which, it is very rea&s;onable to think, he would, and with re&s;entement too, had it not been true. Yet not with&s;tanding this fair warning, he continued his practice of granting warrants again&s;t us.
<PB N="49" REF="012986_0048_0F903E06E46AEFE0">
But the officers were generally &s;o civil as to acquaint us with it in time. Some time after this, Sir J. Gui&s;e and Sir Robert Atkins, being at Perrot's Brook, two miles from Cirence&s;ter, quarrell'd as they were gaming. Sir John drew his Sword, and demanded &s;atisfaction: But tho&s;e in the hou&s;e &s;tepped between and parted them. They &s;eeming to appear pacified, &s;at down again. But afterwards, taking a walk together in the bowling-green, the brea&s;t of Sir John being filled with re&s;entment, he &s;aid, Sir Robert, you gave me the lye; and I will have &s;atisfaction.</P>

<P>If I have &s;aid any thing more than what is common for gentlemen to &s;ay to each other in their play, betwixt you and I, I a&s;k your pardon.</P>

<P>Then draw, or you &s;hall die like a dog.&mdash; They both drew; and Sir Robert gave him a gentle prick in the arm, and &s;aid, I de&s;ire you, Sir John, to take that for &s;atisfaction. I could have had you el&s;e|where; but was unwilling to do you further mi&s;chief.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir John.</SPEAKER>
<P>I'll kill or be killed.</P>

<SPEAKER>Sir Robert.</SPEAKER>
<P>If that be your mind, look to your&s;elf as well as you can; for I &s;hall have you at the next pa&s;s.&mdash; And &s;o he had; for he ran him through, in at the belly and out at the back; on which he fell. Sir Robert &s;tepped up to him, unbuttoned his cloaths, tore his &s;hirt down, and gently drew out his &s;word; and then, after he had well &s;ucked the wound, taking his handkerchief, he rolled up the corners of it hard, and thru&s;t it into the orifice: then buttoning of his cloaths, he lifted him up, and de&s;ired him while he was able, that he would ac|qaint the people of the hou&s;e that his death was owing to his own &s;eeking. And when they were come about him, he was &s;o generous as to &s;ay, "If I die, Sir Ro|bert is clear; for if he had not killed me, I would have killed him." Sir Robert procured him &s;urgeons; and, after a while, when great pain came upon him, he la|mented him&s;elf much, and &s;aid, "It was the ju&s;t hand
<PB N="50" REF="012986_0049_0F903E085FAD15C8">
of God upon me for meddling with the Quakers. But, if he will be plea&s;ed to &s;pare me, and try me again, I'll never have a hand again&s;t them any more. For Hay|wood told me, if I went on per&s;ecuting, the &s;ame hand that overtook my father would overtake me, before I was aware. He further told me, I was &s;et on by &s;ome en|vious prie&s;ts; and I might have time to repent it. And &s;o I do with all my heart. And 'tis true; I could never come into company with Mr. Carele&s;s or Mr. Freame, but they would be &s;tirring me up to put the laws in exe|cution again&s;t Di&s;&s;enters." The &s;word having mi&s;&s;ed his entrails, he recovered, &s;tood candidate for the county after, and never more di&s;turbed our meetings.</P>
<P>The next thing I &s;hall take notice of, is the proceeding of ju&s;tice James George, again&s;t my father, my brother Nathaniel and my&s;elf. He came to the Ram in Ciren|ce&s;ter, and &s;ent for my brother and me. My father went with us. And when we came thither, he &s;aid:&mdash;"'Tis very well, John, that you are come too, I &s;ent for your &s;ons, to let them know it is his Maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure to have the laws put in execution: and now I take this oppor|tunity to let them and you know, that we mu&s;t all be of one church."</P>

<P>Thou oughte&s;t then to be well a&s;&s;ured it is the right church.

<P>A little time after this, he &s;ent to the officers, to bid them go to the Quakers meeting-hou&s;e on &s;unday next, and bring their names to him. The officers were very unwilling to obey his commands; and &s;ome of them ac|quainted me with their orders, de&s;iring we would not meet at the u&s;ual time, or otherwi&s;e that we would meet at another place. I told them, we did not dare &s;o far to deny the wor&s;hip of our God: For, &s;aid I, we wor|&s;hip the &s;ame God that Daniel did: and he, notwith|&s;tanding the &s;evere decree of the King, failed not openly to own God, by praying to him, with his window open as u&s;ual. And our God is the &s;ame he was in Daniel's days, as able to &s;top the mouths of lions as he was then. And we are not afraid to tru&s;t him, having had experience of many deliverances he hath wrought for us. The next fir&s;t day we met at the time and place we u&s;ed to meet; and a good meeting we had, the living pre|&s;ence of the Lord being &s;en&s;ibly felt among&s;t us. One of the con&s;tables came in&punc; and delivered a warrant to my brother John, de&s;iring him to read it. But my brother put it in his pocket, telling him he de&s;igned to read it when the meeting was over. "That will not do, &s;aid he for if you will not read it now, I de&s;ire you to give it to me again." Which he did. And then they took a li&s;t of &s;everal of our names, and carried it to ju&s;tice George. On which he &s;ent out his warrants to di&s;train our goods. They &s;eized my father's corn in his barns, and locked up the barn-doors. And at that &s;ame time the murrain had &s;eized the ju&s;tice's cattle, and they died apace. His &s;teward told him, he mu&s;t &s;end for John
<PB N="52" REF="012986_0051_0F903E0998DFAD00">
Haywood, or he would lo&s;e all his cattle.
<Q>No, &s;aid the ju&s;tice, don't &s;end for him now; becau&s;e I have warrants out again&s;t him and his &s;ons. Send for any body el&s;e.</Q> So the &s;teward &s;ent for another; who did what he could for 'em, but to very little purpo&s;e, for the cattle continued to &s;icken and die as before. The &s;teward then told him, "Plea&s;e your wor&s;hip, if you don't &s;end for John Haywood, I believe you will lo&s;e all your cattle; for now the bull is &s;ick, and off his meat; and I don't find this man does them any good. But if you'll plea&s;e to &s;end for John, I don't que&s;tion but he would be of &s;ervice to them." Send for him then, &s;aid the ju&s;tice; but don't bring him in as you u&s;ed to do. When he has done what he can, pay him, and di&s;mi&s;s him. So my father was &s;ent for, and went (having learned that great chri&s;tian le&s;&s;on to return good for evil) and did his be&s;t for 'em. When he had done, as he was wiping his hands in the entry, the ju&s;tice unde|&s;ignedly came by him; and, &s;eeing he could not avoid his notice, &s;aid, So, John, you have done &s;omething for my cattle, I &s;uppo&s;e. Yes, &s;aid my father, and I hope it will do them good. Well, (&s;aid the ju&s;tice to the &s;teward) pay John.</P>

<P>Then they &s;eized what goods they plea&s;ed, and took them away with them. And after they had tendered us oaths twice more, our mittimus was made, and we were &s;ent to Glouce&s;ter ca&s;tle; where we found &s;everal of our friends before us; and, with them that were &s;ent in &s;oon after us, we became a family of forty or fifty. The jailor's name was John Landborne; and for a piece of &s;ervice I did him gratis in his ab&s;ence (<HI>i. e.</HI> officiating as key-turner, and preventing two notorious robbers from breaking out) I could prevail with him to let &s;everal of our friends go home, when occa&s;ion particularly re|quired, for &s;ome time together. We being a large number of us in pri&s;on, had often large meetings on the fir&s;t-days in the ca&s;tle. Divers of the pri&s;oners, who were not of us, as well as &s;everal people out of the city, would come and &s;it down with us. Therefore Richard Par&s;ons, one of our per&s;ecutors, who lived in the city,
<PB N="55" REF="012986_0054_0F903E0C547244A8">
came to our morning meeting, accompanyed with &s;everal others. My father was pre&s;ent with us, and Henry Panton, (who had formerly been a fencing-ma&s;ter) was preaching, when they came in, concerning the confe&s;|&s;ion of &s;ome, who perpetually &s;ay they are doing what they ought not, and leaving undone what they ought to do: which words Par&s;ons (who was a prie&s;t, a chan|cellor, and a ju&s;tice) took hold of, telling him he was com|plaining of others for what he was doing him&s;elf; for (&s;aid he) you are now doing what you ought not, and leaving undone what you ought to do; catching hold of his grey locks to pull him down. But Henry being a tall man, &s;trong and active, though in years, he &s;tood his ground, and &s;poke over his head. Par&s;ons then &s;trove to &s;top his mouth; but he avoided it, by turning his head on one &s;ide. When he had done &s;peaking, a friend &s;tood up, and &s;aid, "'Tis a &s;ign the devil's hard put to it to have his drudgery done, that prie&s;ts mu&s;t leave their pulpits and pari&s;hioners, to take up the bu&s;ine&s;s of informers again&s;t poor pri&s;oners in the pri&s;on." After prie&s;t Par|&s;ons had been &s;ome time endeavouring to get the names of &s;ome pre&s;ent, and no body would give him information, he thus broke out: "If you are thereabouts, I &s;hall be even with you another way." For he had got a li&s;t of &s;everal of the pri&s;oners names; and taking for granted that they were all pre&s;ent at the time, he &s;ent out his warrants for di&s;training their goods. However, herein he was mi&s;taken&punc; for &s;everal were then ab&s;ent; among whom was Lettice Gu&s;h, a widow, who lived about twenty miles di&s;tant.

<P>What can be done in this ca&s;e? How can we make a legal return of the warrant without executing it?</P>

<P>Carry it back to Mr. Par&s;ons, and tell him to wipe his breech with it; and I will bear you out in it.</P>

<P>So they returned, without giving her any further trouble. Another warrant was i&s;&s;ued out again&s;t Francis Boy, phy&s;ician, on the &s;ame account, and of the &s;ame value, who was likewi&s;e ab&s;ent at the time of his pre|tended conviction. When the officers came to di&s;train his goods, he was not at home. So his cattle were taken away to the value of between twenty and thirty pounds. He afterwards, on in&s;pection, found by his books, that he was attending a gentleman the time he was &s;aid to be convicted. To this gentleman he went, and enquired of him if he could remember the day he attended him? The gentleman an&s;wered, "He had good rea&s;on to remember it; for (&s;aid he) if you had not done what you did for me that day, I believe I &s;hould have been now in my grave." He then informed the gentleman of the rea&s;on that induced him to give him that trouble. "Well (replied he) I advi&s;e you to ap|peal to the next quarter &s;e&s;&s;ions for redre&s;s and you may a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf I will endeavour to &s;erve you what lies in my power; for I will take my oath before any judge or bench of ju&s;tices in England that you was with me that day." But it &s;o fell out that he had no occa&s;ion to appeal. For it &s;oon <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> that he had &s;uch a &s;ub&s;tantial evidence in his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">; and his cattle were returned before the &s;e&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>Not long after it plea&s;ed God to vi&s;it my dear father with &s;ickne&s;s that proved mortal. I had have to attend him the major part of the time he was &s;ick: and the Lord was plea&s;ed to favour him with his living pre&s;ence in his la&s;t moments: and having honourably fini&s;hed his

days work, he departed this life in the year 1683, and was interred in the piece of ground he had long before given to friends for a burying-place, &s;ituate at the lower end of his orchard, at Siddington, near Cirence&s;ter.</P>
<P>Some days after his interment, I had the news that my brother and my&s;elf, with four friends more, were di&s;charged by the judge; but that the other four were detained for the fees I therefore went down to u&s;e my intere&s;t for their di&s;charge. I found him ill in bed; and he told me he was very willing to remit the fees belong|ing to him&s;elf; but there was &s;ome due to the under-&s;heriff, and tho&s;e were not in his power. But &s;oon after providence &s;o ordered that we all had our liberty; and I came and &s;ettled at my pre&s;ent habitation at Che&s;ham, in Buckingham&s;hire, where I have now dwelt about forty years.</P>
<P>Thus, con&s;idering that it were great pity tho&s;e &s;in|gular providences of the Almighty &s;hould not be re|corded, for the benefit of po&s;terity, I was willing for my own peru&s;al and that of my family, and &s;ome few particular friends, to commit them to writing. In the doing of which, re&s;pecting the &s;everal conferences my father had with the bi&s;hops, and others, before-men|tioned, I have been careful to pen them down in the &s;ame words they were then expre&s;&s;ed in, as near as I could recollect, or at lea&s;t to retain the genuine &s;en&s;e and purport of them. Which, reader, if they tend to thy confirmation and encouragement in a cour&s;e of true chri&s;tian piety, I have my end; who am</P>
