We whose Names are hereunto subscribed, Do heartily, sincerely and solemnly profess, testify and declare, That His present Majesty KING <HI>WILLIAM</HI> is rightful and lawful KING of the Realms of <HI>England, Scotland</HI> and <HI>Ireland:</HI> And we do mutually promise and engage to stand by and assist each other to the utmost of our power, in the support and defence of His Majesties most Sacred Person and Government, against the late King <HI>James</HI> and all his Adherents. And in case His Majesty come to any Violent or untimely Death (which GOD forbid) We do hereby further freely and unanimously oblige our selves, to unite associate and stand by each other in revenging the same upon His Enemies and their Adherents, and in supporting and defending the Succession of the Crown, according to an Act made in the first year of the Reign of King <HI>WILLIAM</HI> and Queen <HI>MARY,</HI> Intituled, <HI>An Act Declaring the Rights and Liberties of the Subject, and settling the Succession of the Crown.</HI></P>
