<P>THE &s;anguinary &s;chemes of the pre&s;ent Admi|ni&s;tration have been &s;ealed with the appro|bation of the late mini&s;terial Parliament. Every ve&s;&s;el that came to this, or the neighbouring ports, &s;ince the proceedings of our late Congre&s;s were publi&s;hed in London, brought us fre&s;h intelligence of the ho&s;tile mea&s;ures re&s;olved on again&s;t us.&mdash;More regiments are to be &s;ent over, &s;ome of which will be &s;tationed in this metropolis, and in New-Jer&s;ey, to &s;upport the <HI>King's friends,</HI> to intimidate, and divide us, to be a check on the &s;outhern Colonies, and if judged practicable, to <HI>prevent</HI> their relieving our &s;uffering brethren of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay.</P>
<P>The&s;e particulars, and many more have, doubtle&s;s, come to the knowledge of that <HI>body,</HI> commonly &s;tiled our <HI>Repre&s;entatives</HI>:&mdash;And yet, among&s;t the objects of <HI>real</HI> complaint, <HI>re&s;olved</HI> as &s;uch by that A&s;&s;embly, in their late catalogue of grievances, we do not read any of the ruinous con&s;equences of an act of Parliament, which was <HI>&s;olely</HI> machinated to <HI>extort</HI> the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of <HI>all</HI> the Briti&s;h Colonies to every parliamentary, or, what is &s;ynonimous, to every mini&s;terial mandate,
<PB N="4" REF="014351_0003_0F91ECFB98D42BB0">
though ever &s;o ruinous! But it may be predicted that, &s;ooner or later, this act will have the intended effect, &s;hould its not appearing to pre&s;s upon us <HI>in a direct manner,</HI> render us &s;o inattentive, or &s;o very &s;elfi&s;h as to &s;uffer its <HI>continuing</HI> to be enforced WITH IMPUNITY.</P>
<P>This introduction mu&s;t point out to you, that the act, or rather edict here alluded to, is THAT, which was made <HI>for extending</HI> to <HI>all</HI> the Briti&s;h Colonies on this Continent, the acts of Parliament <HI>relating</HI> to mu|tiny and de&s;ertion <HI>in Great Britain,</HI> as likewi&s;e, to maintain the di&s;cipline of <HI>his Maje&s;ty's army,</HI> &s;o &s;tiled, <HI>in&s;tead</HI> of its true <HI>de&s;criptive</HI> name, <HI>the Briti&s;h,</HI> or <HI>National army</HI>:&mdash;An impropriety of the greate&s;t im|portance to a free people, ju&s;tly jealous of their ho|nour, and con&s;cious of their real dignity! But, to the manife&s;t danger of the national Liberty, this is little attended to, by military men; too many of whom, from a Field-Mar&s;hal to a drummer, <HI>mi&s;take</HI> the true &s;en&s;e of that phra&s;eology, which, when at fir&s;t u&s;ed, was meant but as a <HI>compliment,</HI> and appeared, as it really was, perfectly harmle&s;s, <HI>before</HI> our Kings kept a <HI>&s;tanding army.</HI> Erroneous notions on this head are now big with ruin, it being not unfrequent to find in the military order, a <HI>commi&s;&s;ioned,</HI> as well as a <HI>non-commi&s;&s;ioned</HI> varlet, ignorant enough to believe, that he <HI>eats</HI> the <HI>King's bread,</HI> and <HI>is bound,</HI> for that very rea&s;on, implicitly <HI>to obey any command</HI> he receives from his &s;uperiors, who <HI>eat</HI> the <HI>&s;ame</HI> bread! As men of this &s;tamp never inquire with <HI>who&s;e bread</HI> the King, him&s;elf, is fed, it is judged very nece&s;&s;ary, at <HI>this</HI> critical juncture, to awake the attention and &s;en&s;ibility of many men of liberal principles, who &s;erve in the <HI>Briti&s;h army</HI> and <HI>navy,</HI> &s;ome of whom in|advertently <HI>mention</HI> the King, and even <HI>addre&s;s</HI> him, as <HI>their ma&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>The enemies to our con&s;titution, well knowing the fatal effects of the illu&s;ion, which this old prejudice never fails to produce in the minds of the vulgar, &s;ur|reptitiou&s;ly
<PB N="5" REF="014351_0004_0F91ECFC55A02200">
<HI>provided</HI> them&s;elves with the <HI>exten&s;ion edict,</HI> before [though <HI>not long before</HI>] the late Parliament i&s;&s;ued their <HI>inqui&s;itorial</HI> &s;entences again&s;t the people of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay. That edict demon&s;trates to you, by what means the Mini&s;try have determined to conduct their CONSPIRACY again&s;t our Liberty.&mdash; Surely, this is a <HI>grievance</HI> of the fir&s;t magnitude!</P>
<P>The American news papers have informed you &s;ince that time, that Courts-Martial have dared to de|cree <HI>various</HI> puni&s;hments, which have been <HI>inflicted</HI> on &s;oldiers in America;&mdash;but, tho' &s;uch Courts Martial acted under colour of that &s;ame <HI>illegal</HI> edict&punc; we do not learn that any of their members, or the deluded victims that became their accomplices, by executing the <HI>felonious</HI> &s;entences, have been indicted for their re&s;pective crimes! Nay, have not &s;uch unlawful Courts-Martial been &s;uffered in our metropolis, to ex|erci&s;e the &s;ame illegal authority?</P>
<P>About the beginning of the la&s;t war, an Admini|&s;tration which had formed no de&s;ign again&s;t our liberty, acted on very different principles, to prevent the mutiny and de&s;ertion of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> forces in North America! The mini&s;ter &s;ent circular directions to mo&s;t of the American Governors, for procuring <HI>tem|porary Acts,</HI> which, as they manife&s;tly tended to the welfare and &s;afety of the whole Briti&s;h empire, were cheerfully <HI>granted.</HI> The legi&s;latures to which &s;uch applications were made, <HI>extended</HI> to their re&s;pective territories, the acts of Parliament for puni&s;hing mu|tiny and de&s;ertion, &amp;c. Tho&s;e acts, afterwards, <HI>re|ceived</HI> the <HI>royal a&s;&s;ent</HI>:&mdash;But the legal force of every &s;uch temporary act has long &s;ince expired. They were granted with the &s;ame caution, that acts of a &s;imilar nature pa&s;s in Great-Britain, where the Lords and Com|mons know, that the national liberty might be ea&s;ily de&s;troyed, &s;hould they declare acts of &s;uch importance, PERPETUAL. The Legi&s;lature can give no <HI>lawful</HI> autho|rity to &s;uch acts of <HI>perpetual</HI> duration, any more than they
<PB N="6" REF="014351_0005_0F91ECFD12ED0820">
can lawfully &s;urrender the liberties of the people. The&s;e have, in re&s;erve, an <HI>unalienable</HI> right to <HI>ratify,</HI> or <HI>annul,</HI> every act of their Delegates to legi&s;lative A&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>The fair proceedings of the Admini&s;tration above mentioned, are of public notoriety. They <HI>not only</HI> prove, in the mo&s;t authentic manner, that Admini|&s;tration <HI>then believed</HI> the Briti&s;h Parliament had <HI>no right</HI> to bind us, in <HI>all ca&s;es what&s;oever</HI>&mdash;but that <HI>the King and his Mini&s;ters</HI> were &s;olicitous to demon|&s;trate the uprightne&s;s of their intentions&mdash;that they would <HI>not</HI> violate <HI>any</HI> of our <HI>con&s;titutional</HI> rights, by attempting to bind us, in <HI>any ca&s;e what&s;oever, without</HI> our legal con&s;ent.</P>
<P>The Anti-Briti&s;h junto, being &s;en&s;ible the <HI>legal expiration</HI> of tho&s;e <HI>temporary acts</HI> of the Colonies was an invincible ob&s;tacle to their projects of <HI>depredation,</HI> &s;o artfully conducted them&s;elves in, and out of Parli|ament that their dark de&s;igns were not &s;u&s;pected. For this rea&s;on, the patriotic Minority, who did not think that more regiments were <HI>intended</HI> to be &s;ent over to America, made little or no oppo&s;ition to the exten&s;ion edict.&mdash;This &s;hows you, my brethren, how cautious you ought to be of your friends, them&s;elves. They may be &s;incere&mdash;but, they do not feel!</P>
<P>Let us &s;ee now, what our late venerable Congre&s;s did for us&mdash;they who <HI>felt</HI> with us, the innumerable evils, that are in&s;eparable from a &s;tanding army, <HI>not</HI> dependent on our&s;elves!&mdash;Their ninth re&s;olve ex|pre&s;sly declares, that to keep &s;uch army, is un|lawful, and con&s;equently proclaims the <HI>nullity</HI> of the <HI>exten&s;ion edict,</HI> in the comprehen&s;ive words, which are prefixed to this addre&s;s, although the <HI>con&s;equence</HI> which re&s;ults from the truth contained in them, being founded on the &s;elf-evident principles of univer&s;al juri&s;prudence, that re&s;pectable authority might have been omitted here, without the lea&s;t danger. This con&s;equence is ac|knowledged by the uniform proceedings of every
<PB N="7" REF="014351_0006_0F91ECFDCB98F2C8">
civilized country relative to di&s;tributive ju&s;tice, as well as in the judgment of every per&s;on, who is not in a &s;tate of in&s;anity. <HI>Whatever is done anywhere again&s;t law, cannot be &s;upported there, by law.</HI> It is a mere <HI>nullity.</HI></P>
<P>We have often been a&s;toni&s;hed at the &s;uperlative effrontery of mini&s;terial hirelings; and yet, it is im|probable any caviller of that tribe, will be &s;o irreve|rent and &s;currilous as to urge, that the ninth re&s;olve of the Congre&s;s does not affect the Exten&s;ion Edict.&mdash; However, &s;hould you meet with that wretch, read to him, and intrench your&s;elves <HI>within</HI> the tenth re&s;olve in their <HI>bill of rights,</HI> from which the following quo|tation is in&s;erted here, to &s;upport the ninth re&s;olve, and &s;everal other parts of this Addre&s;s; to wit,</P>
<P>"All and each of which," (that is to &s;ay, <HI>the rights mentioned in the nine preceding re&s;olves,</HI>) <Q>the afore&s;aid Deputies in behalf of them&s;elves, and their con&s;ti|tuents, do claim, demand, and in&s;i&s;t on, as their in|dubitable Rights and Liberties; which cannot be le|gally taken from them, altered or abridged by any power whatever, without their own con&s;ent, by their repre&s;entatives, in their &s;everal Provincial Legi&s;latures.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In the cour&s;e of our enquiry we find many infringe|ments and violations of the foregoing rights; which, from an ardent de&s;ire that harmony and a mutual intercour&s;e of affection and intere&s;t may be re&s;tored, we pa&s;s over for the pre&s;ent, and proceed to &s;tate &s;uch acts and mea&s;ures as have been adopted &s;ince the la&s;t war, which demon&s;trate a &s;y&s;tem formed to en&s;lave America.</Q></P>
<P>Now, can a <HI>fair</HI> rea&s;oner a&s;&s;ert, that, notwith&s;tand|ing the <HI>declared illegality</HI> of the infringements alluded to in the preceding quotation, the declaration implies, that the Congre&s;s admitted the <HI>legal</HI> operation of any &s;uch act, <HI>till</HI> it &s;hould be <HI>repealed?</HI>&mdash;That it is to be &s;o under&s;tood, though the whole of the proceedings
<PB N="8" REF="014351_0007_0F91ECFE8BA28400">
&s;hows, that <HI>it is feared</HI> there will be <HI>a civil war, un|le&s;s they be repealed</HI>?&mdash;Though the repeal be &s;olicited, <HI>not to annul</HI> &s;uch acts, they being all <HI>illegal,</HI> and <HI>every one of them,</HI> whether <HI>enumerated or not,</HI> being con&s;e|quently <HI>null and void,</HI>&mdash;BUT "to re&s;tore harmony," <HI>that is,</HI> to <HI>prevent</HI> that civil war, which is ju&s;tly <HI>feared, unle&s;s</HI> the violences which have been <HI>already</HI> commit|ted, <HI>to enforce</HI> tho&s;e <HI>unlawful, illegal,</HI> and NULL acts, be <HI>di&s;continued</HI>?</P>
<P>If tho&s;e men, who &s;olemnly appealing to God and the equity of mankind, for the ju&s;tice of our cau&s;e, de|clared to you and the other members of the Briti&s;h nation, that "to keep a Standing Army in the&s;e colo|nies, without our con&s;ent," <HI>is again&s;t law,</HI> had ju&s;ti|fied the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of their admitting <HI>that it was not again&s;t law to puni&s;h, without our con&s;ent,</HI> mutiny and de&s;ertion in &s;uch <HI>unlawful</HI> Standing Army&mdash;Believe me, my dear, devoted coun|try men, the mo&s;t iniquitous Admini&s;tration, that can be conceived&mdash;the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> Admini&s;tration it&s;elf, never would wi&s;h to ob&s;truct their proceedings.</P>
<P>The Exten&s;ion Act is <HI>unlawful, illegal</HI> and <HI>null,</HI> being made to &s;upport the di&s;cipline of an <HI>unlawful</HI> &s;tanding army: And &s;hould a &s;tanding army be made <HI>lawful</HI> in any colony, which God avert! the Exten&s;ion Act would, neverthele&s;s, remain <HI>unlawful, illegal,</HI> and <HI>null</HI> in that colony, until the legi&s;lature &s;hould have given it <HI>there,</HI> local <HI>lawfulne&s;s, legality,</HI> and therefore <HI>exi&s;tence.</HI> But, you have do rea&s;on to fear this; for <HI>&s;elf-pre&s;ervation</HI> will effectually prevent the mo&s;t aban|doned traitor from making a motion of that tendency, in any American legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly, again&s;t the &s;afe|ty of a people, protected by the Briti&s;h con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Regardle&s;s of every principle of ju&s;tice and policy, the Briti&s;h Parliament are trying again&s;t our Liberty, experiments which, if hazarded again&s;t the people un|der their immediate legi&s;lative authority, would infal|libly involve Great-Britain in a civil war, and might
<PB N="9" REF="014351_0008_0F91ECFF4D1146A0">
produce <HI>another</HI> revolution there. The king is ve&s;t|ed with the &s;upreme command of all the forces of the nation, wherever they may be &s;tationed; but he has no legal coercive authority any where, over the &s;oldiers or &s;ailors, otherwi&s;e than by local laws, made from time to time, to that effect. And, as the &s;afety of every con&s;titutional right depends on the limita|tion of that authority, the other branches of the le|gi&s;lature grant him but temporary acts, for maintain|ing the di&s;cipline of the Army and Navy, by coercive laws, and for re&s;training or enlarging the power of Courts-Martial in both the&s;e departments, within the limits of that legi&s;lature by which they are granted.</P>
<P>The limited duration of tho&s;e laws being as &s;hort as it appears from occa&s;ional circum&s;tances, to be con&s;i&s;|tent with public &s;afety, the <HI>trea&s;onable</HI> de&s;igns of Ad|mini&s;tration may be counteracted with more facility, <HI>than</HI> if &s;uch laws were <HI>perpetual. After</HI> the legal expiration of tho&s;e acts, the King's lawful authority over the national forces, expiring of cour&s;e, can he <HI>puni&s;h,</HI> or <HI>detain</HI> any body in <HI>that</HI> &s;ervice, &s;ince Courts-Martial are <HI>aboli&s;hed</HI> by law, as they <HI>now</HI> are <HI>in the Briti&s;h Colonies</HI>? And, if the King would attempt to retain them in <HI>his own</HI> &s;ervice, how could he accom|pli&s;h it, before he had u&s;urped an arbitrary power over the pur&s;es of the people?&mdash;Could he &s;atisfy capricious demands, which would increa&s;e in pro|portion to the knowledge that every man in <HI>his</HI> army and navy would have of the embarra&s;&s;ments of <HI>their ma&s;ter</HI>?&mdash;No&mdash;for, tho&s;e &s;alutary limitations are <HI>&s;olely</HI> intended to pre&s;erve inviolate, our rights of opening or &s;hutting up our pur&s;es, as we think fit. They have, till now, prevented &s;uch u&s;urpations, which, to ex|erci&s;e with &s;afety, is the ultimate end of <HI>every other</HI> u&s;urpation that ever was exerci&s;ed by any tyrant in the world.&mdash;It was but to attain <HI>that end,</HI> the <HI>&s;elfi&s;h</HI> Parliament of Great-Britain have &s;o flagitiou&s;ly ex|ceeded the limits of lawful power.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="014351_0009_0F91ED000CEB7AD8">If you admit as lawful, the exten&s;ion illegally de|creed by a mini&s;terial Parliament, and machinated, but as a <HI>provi&s;ional edict,</HI> to in&s;ure the &s;ucce&s;s of mea|&s;ures re&s;olved on, relatively to the pro&s;cription of the Bo&s;tonians, and other pro&s;criptions <HI>in petto.</HI> If you <HI>only</HI> tolerate its illegal operation any longer, the king will not experience tho&s;e difficulties, which would thwart his arbitrary projects in Great Britain, were his u&s;urpations to begin there. <HI>His</HI> Parliament might pay us the compliment of renewing the Exten&s;ion, and other Temporary Acts of their own &s;ole legi&s;|lation, for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing a Revenue, to lighten their own burthens, which luxury and cor|ruption have already prodigiou&s;ly increa&s;ed, and which your tamene&s;s will increa&s;e to a degree, which it is now beyond the power of calculators to a&s;certain.&mdash; But, you may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured that, in a very &s;hort time, Admini&s;tration will &s;port with your Liberties, and &s;oon after, with tho&s;e of the whole Briti&s;h Empire.&mdash; The opprobrious and degrading denomination of <HI>pro|vince,</HI> which now is but an innocent and unmeant mi&s;|application of a foreign word adopted in our lan|guage, will &s;ignificantly de&s;cribe the real &s;tate of every Briti&s;h Colony, and indeed, of every &s;hire in Great-Britain and Ireland!&mdash;Never forget that about two years ago, a Crowned Mi&s;creant compelled the States of Sweden, the Parliament of that Country, to relea&s;e him from his Coronation Oath! His &s;ucce&s;s may tempt others to commit the &s;ame &s;acrilege.</P>
<P>Our enemies are now terrified at the &s;uperiority of &s;trength, which the ju&s;tice of our cau&s;e gives us over them, in the pre&s;ent conte&s;t.

to a better change. Then, our di&s;gui&s;ed friends, and our open foes, united in the Briti&s;h Parliament, will, with iron hands and unfeeling hearts, "bind us in all ca&s;es what&s;oever." We &s;hall be in the condition of the Swedes, French, Spaniards, and mo&s;t other na|tions, where now and then, an hone&s;t man may regret the lo&s;s of his natural Rights, but where, an attempt to recover them would be next to madne&s;s.</P>
<P>It will be a melancholy reflection to us, perhaps for many years! that no &s;trictures have yet been tender|ed, re&s;pecting the de&s;tructive tendency of the Exten|&s;ion Edict.

But, may not the well-known fate of a PORTEUS check traitors, by convincing them, that they cannot always &s;helter them&s;elves under the wings of prerogative? And, &s;hould this prove ineffectual, our holy re|ligion teaches us, that no worldly con&s;ideration ought to deter the ju&s;t from doing his duty. Our committees, and what is much &s;afer, Colonial Conventions, ve&s;ted

with di&s;cretionary powers, will, at la&s;t, baffle the arts of mini&s;terial tools, and work our political &s;alvation.</P>
<P>If there be among&s;t us a con&s;cientious lawyer, he certainly will point out to the officers of the unlawful &s;tanding army, &s;tationed in the Briti&s;h colonies, the imminent danger they run, by detaining &s;oldiers in North-America, under the illegal exten&s;ion edict. As to pettifoggers, we know they are &s;educed by the pro&s;|pect of a plentiful harve&s;t; and that, &s;elf-intere&s;t, not ju&s;tice, determines them to act, whatever &s;ide they undertake to defend. If the mini&s;ter do not value the&s;e enough to retain them in his &s;ervice, for &s;upporting the unlawful acts, they will, of cour&s;e, rejoice at the almo&s;t innumerable actions of a civil nature, which may be grounded on the local nullity of parlia|mentary edicts, and commenced by &s;oldiers, for unju&s;t detention, lo&s;s of time, and unpaid labour; or for various tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, unju&s;tifiable before tribunals, which follow the Briti&s;h &s;y&s;tem of law.</P>
<P>All injuries &s;u&s;tained by any per&s;on in this colony, in con&s;equence of the &s;ame unlawful &s;anction, may be redre&s;&s;ed, and the &s;ame offences will be prevented for the future, if we have but &s;en&s;e and firmne&s;s enough to apply as we &s;hould, and where we &s;hould. It is ne|ver too late to do our duty; let us tru&s;t the event to the omnipotent ruler of the univer&s;e, and he will reward our per&s;everance.</P>
<P>If through ignorance, or inattention, any of you ever gave a verdict, in contradiction to the fundamentals of ju&s;tice; if he admitted the force of any act of Parlia|ment, to which your own colonial laws have given no &s;uch force, that man mu&s;t be very unhappy, whene|ver he reflects on the inju&s;tice he has occa&s;ioned; but he is guiltle&s;s&mdash;he de&s;erves compa&s;&s;ion.&mdash;It is far diffe|rent with jurymen, who knew the local nullity of acts of Parliament, and by their verdicts, authori&s;ed their illegal operation!&mdash;Tho&s;e jurymen, and the judges who de&s;ignedly &s;uffered it&mdash;who have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the
<PB N="14" REF="014351_0013_0F91ED030CFB74B0">
warnings and in&s;tructions which they ought to have given, and &s;trengthened with their eloquence, have been bribed. Whether hope, feare avarice, or any other worldly motive influenced &s;uch judges and jury|men&mdash;they have been <HI>bribed.</HI>&mdash;They &s;tand <HI>guilty,</HI> be|fore God and man, of wilful and corrupt perjury.</P>
<P>Do not believe, my dear countrymen, that infatuated as the junto may be, they hope that the Continental A&s;&s;ociation can be di&s;&s;olved, by the external, the &s;eem|ing defection of any colony, were it even <HI>ours,</HI> which is nearly central, and the mo&s;t liable to &s;uch &s;u&s;picions. A Governor may bribe the majority of an a&s;&s;embly, who fancy that they repre&s;ent a people, not virtuous enough to exerci&s;e their rights of choo&s;ing their re|pre&s;entatives and elective officers, by ballot. Illegal warrants may be i&s;&s;ued, and remain unqua&s;hed, for a con&s;iderable time, to bewilder the bulk of the people with the innumerable doubts, which, it is evident, will ari&s;e from the untried illegality of tho&s;e proceed|ings;&mdash;to intimidate and oppre&s;s, till the bench de|termine the que&s;tion;&mdash;and, in the mean while, to deter the injured from pro&s;ecuting &s;uch daring con|&s;pirators.</P>
<P>He may bribe a few trading ju&s;tices, and &s;educe other &s;ons of corruption and power, who hold, or expect to hold magi&s;tracy, or other offices, during plea&s;ure, and are as much afraid of colonial conven|tions, as the mini&s;ter is of Continental Congre&s;&s;es:&mdash; But he cannot bribe the body of the people, in whom, originally, and finally, lies the &s;overeign power&punc; re|pre&s;ented for their benefit only, by <HI>one</HI> &s;ingle per&s;on.</P>
<P>All the Colonies, nay, the internal force of any &s;ingle colony can puni&s;h a few venal officers, for abu|&s;ing the authority with which they are intru&s;ted by their &s;uperiors, who are, them&s;elves, &s;ubordinate to <HI>another</HI> &s;uperior, likewi&s;e intru&s;ted by, and, as glori|ous experience &s;hows, accountable, as well as every one of his dependents, <HI>to the people</HI> at large, whether they

meet in one &s;ingle &s;pot, or in their re&s;pective di&s;tricts. The patriotic &s;pirit of the American Britons cannot be &s;ubdued. They will exerci&s;e their con&s;titutional right to hold conventions for their &s;afety; a right, which cannot be que&s;tioned, without openly denying the legal title of the Hanoverian line of our Kings, to the Briti&s;h crown. Therefore, my dear countrymen, do not ba&s;ely relinqui&s;h that &s;acred right, when you ought to exerci&s;e it. You know that, &s;hould you be oppre&s;|&s;ed by a wicked knot of traitors, you will be delivered by your happier neighbours, as &s;oon as their a&s;&s;i&s;tance is required.</P>
<P>The arch-fiend to our con&s;titution knows all this: The Colonies which delegated members to the late Congre&s;s, have already appalled him, that in&s;olent, cruel, and cowardly wretch, who, a year ago, decla|red by his wicked trumpet, that he would not relent, "till he &s;aw you pro&s;trate at his feet!" Your Con|gre&s;s made him &s;toop to propo&s;als, which he well knows you will reject with di&s;dain. He means but to divide and betray you, whom he de&s;pairs to &s;ubju|gate by force. However, he will &s;end more troops, more indeed, than he thinks it is prudent now to di|vulge. But it is not &s;olely in that reinforcement he confides. Will you believe it, my dear, devoted coun|trymen, it is in his opinion of your folly! I &s;hall re|veal to you his grand &s;ecret&mdash; the only re&s;ource left him to extort your compliance.</P>
<P>Now that the vices of the nation have reduced to a &s;tate of impotence, the &s;mall portion of virtue which &s;till remains in the Briti&s;h Parliament, he hopes that a &s;uper&s;titious reverence for that body, degenerate as it is, will continue to betray you into ab&s;urdities, and an in|con&s;i&s;tent pa&s;&s;ivene&s;s! He &s;till hopes that your <HI>inattenti|on</HI> to the <HI>Exten&s;ion Edict</HI> will enable him at la&s;t to defeat your united forces. Your &s;upinene&s;s ju&s;tifies him in believing, and per&s;uading his a&s;&s;ociates, that you will always tolerate the operation of that de&s;tructive Edict,
<PB N="16" REF="014351_0015_0F91ED048B359548">
which is &s;ufficient in it&s;elf, to put all the others in force.</P>
<P>Can we, without feeling the &s;evere&s;t &s;tings of &s;elf-reproach, reflect on the many crimes, which, &s;ince the Exten&s;ion Act was quietly enforced, our inatten|tion has emboldened Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e Officers, and other &s;ons of tyranny to commit? Oh! had criminal pro&s;e|cutions been in&s;tituted in that country, where the fir&s;t felony, or the fir&s;t degradation of human nature was committed, in defiance of our laws, and under the u&s;urped authority of Courts-Martial, or rather, imme|diately after their fir&s;t unwarrantable &s;entence was known!&mdash;Had &s;oldiers been duly protected again&s;t their tyrannical ma&s;ters, robberies and murders might have been prevented; our brethren at BOSTON could not be dragooned; we might long ago have de|fied the combinations of the parricidal junto, who&s;e aim is to de&s;troy our con&s;titution!&mdash;We &s;hould no longer fear their dethroning our King, and fixing his Crown on the head of a race of tyrants, whom a pa|triotic Parliament ju&s;tly pro&s;cribed, about ninety years ago, as irreconcileable foes to the natural rights of the Briti&s;h Nation! With truth and &s;ecurity we might tell the arch-fiend "What do you think of Venal Parliaments NOW?"</P>
<P>Since no &s;ophi&s;try can delude an incorrupted Ame|rican Jury; &s;ince the joint efforts of the Mini&s;terial hirelings cannot, without our connivance, hold up be|fore the eyes of the &s;oldiers, the veil which hides from them the knowledge of their civil rights, let us in&s;truct tho&s;e deluded victims; let us openly protect them again&s;t their oppre&s;&s;ors. If we adopt this paci|fie mode of re&s;i&s;tance, which no political ca&s;u|i&s;t, who has &s;ub&s;cribed to the revolution Creed, can di&s;approve, the mini&s;ter may &s;end over as many regi|ments as he plea&s;es; the intended in&s;truments of our ruin will but add to our &s;trength add pro&s;perity. As &s;oon as they know it is again&s;t law to detain
<PB N="17" REF="014351_0016_0F91ED054B6F5A58">
them in the army, the mini&s;terial army, there will be no ob&s;tacle to their de&s;ertion. Then, but not be|fore, Sycophants, paid to calumniate and betray the Briti&s;h colonies, will in vain attempt to per&s;uade the in&s;tructed, and le&s;s credulous &s;oldiers, that we &s;hall deliver them up to facilitate our reconciliation with the Briti&s;h Parliament, who will not hear of any propo&s;al of accommodation, unle&s;s this, their <HI>&s;ine qua non</HI> condition, be fir&s;t complied with. If we adopt this generous mea&s;ure, we &s;hall enjoy the pure&s;t plea&s;ure that can affect freemen&mdash;that of re&s;|cuing our fellow creatures, our brethren, from di&s;|graceful bondage. And, if experience can teach us wi&s;dom, we &s;hall &s;o cautiou&s;ly grant temporary acts, for preventing mutiny and de&s;ertion, &s;hould ever the &s;afety of the Briti&s;h Empire make it again nece&s;&s;ary to grant &s;uch acts, that the abominable project of re|ducing us into a &s;tate of Slavery, by the means of a &s;tanding army, cannot enter the head of any fu|ture mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>The virtuous part of the Briti&s;h Officers, them|&s;elves, impatiently wait for this manife&s;tation of our prudence. They will &s;ecretly rejoice, as Britons, at the mutiny and de&s;ertion of whole Battalions, what|ever they may do in their public character, to the contrary. And General Gage, whom his weakne&s;s and incapacity recommended to a perfidious Admini|&s;tration, who emulou&s;ly extol his abilities, though they would not have employed him, if a &s;en&s;ible man of an e&s;tabli&s;hed military reputation, had accepted the di&s;honourable command&mdash;That General, whom they have decorated but as a bound victim, may be brought to ju&s;tice, and an&s;wer for the many crimes, which his thir&s;t of power, in&s;pired him to perpetrate, or patro|ni&s;e, as the mo&s;t acceptable offerings, which could pro|pitiate to him his tutelar Deity at St. James's.</P>
<P>It is not yet too late to pur&s;ue this plan of philan|thropy and &s;elf-defence; but we mu&s;t exert our&s;elves
<PB N="18" REF="014351_0017_0F91ED060B610A48">
with activity and con&s;tancy. If we lo&s;e time, the &s;oldiers, not knowing the local nullity of an Edict, made for the purpo&s;e of detaining them again&s;t law, on an unnatural &s;ervice which they abhor, will be afraid of being treacherou&s;ly delivered up, in ca&s;e they de&s;ert. They will not cea&s;e to be awed by illegal Courts-Martial, though if they were proper|ly in&s;tructed, they would not fear, but de&s;pi&s;e the authority u&s;urped by tho&s;e Courts; and the &s;oldiers who have been injured by them, or by any military officer, would obtain legal redre&s;s, &s;hould they make proper application.</P>
<P>If we &s;uffer them to be mi&s;led by a &s;acrilegious in|terpretation of their military oath, from which they are relea&s;ed as &s;oon as the army is kept again&s;t law: If we &s;candalou&s;ly for&s;ake them, in vain &s;hall we cry out to them, in the &s;train of the Roman Patriot,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Qu&ograve; qu&ograve; Scele&s;ti ruitis?</L>
