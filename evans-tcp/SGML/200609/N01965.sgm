<HEAD>The day of a godly Man's DEATH, Better than the day of his BIRTH.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>ECCL. VII. I.</BIBL>
<Q>A good Name is better than precious Oyntment: and <HI>the day of Death, than the day of one's Birth.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE main scope of the <HI>royal Preacher</HI> in this sacred book (written in his advanc'd years, and the product of great thought, as well as long expe|riment) is to correct many false sentiments, two common, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">' very foolish, concerning the chief good, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to human happiness; and to give us plain and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fallible direction in this great pursuit.
<PB N="2" REF="002336_0004_0FDB2ACFD5AB1E80">
Here he has laid together an admirable variety of just &amp; wise &amp; useful observations; many of which run counter to some of the receiv'd Notions of Man|kind, and at first view do not a little surprise and shock our Minds; but upon an impartial conside|ration they approve themselves to our enlighten'd reason, and challenge our belief &amp; entertainment of them, as <HI>true</HI> and <HI>faithful sayings.</HI> He largely and clearly proves the vanity of this World; the vile|ness of Sin; the wisdom, excellency &amp; manifold ad|vantages of Religion, and the necessity of being re|ligious in order to being happy.</P>
<P>THUS in our Text, He observes to us, that <Q>the <HI>honour of virtue</HI> is preferable to all the enjoy|ments of this World: and that <HI>going out</HI> of this World is to the <HI>godly Man</HI> a greater <HI>kindness,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Henry,</HI> in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE> than his <HI>coming into</HI> the World was.</Q></P>
<P><HI>A good Name is better than precious Oyntment:</HI> Under this phrase here of <HI>precious Oyntment,</HI> are comprehended all the <HI>riches, pleasures, &amp; honours</HI> of the present World. In a <HI>good Name</HI> is imply'd true <HI>solid religion;</HI> the reality, as well as a repu|tation for it.</P>
<P>AND the Words carry in them this great truth, That <HI>a deserved good Name, or just character for wisdom &amp; piety, is really more valuable, than all the pomp, &amp; pleasures, &amp; profits of this transitory World.</HI> A <HI>good Name</HI> is what all, that have any sense of de|cency or humanity, do put a <HI>high estimate</HI> upon, and rate even next unto <HI>Life:</HI> but to <HI>deserve</HI> a good Name is in truth <HI>more</HI> to be valu'd &amp; desir'd than Life it self. To be divinely <HI>Wise &amp; Good,</HI> is un|speakably
<PB N="3" REF="002336_0004_0FDB2ACFD5AB1E80">
better, than to be worldly <HI>great &amp; rich</HI> Wisdom &amp; Goodness are <HI>essential</HI> to our true happi|ness; but wealth &amp; grandeur are not. The meanest <HI>Beggar,</HI> that hath, and meriteth a good Name, is infinitely happier, than the greatest <HI>Monarch</HI> upon Earth without it. Indeed the unthinking part of Mankind do <HI>call the proud happy:</HI> and there is a vulgar saying, <HI>Better be happy than wise;</HI> but this is none of <HI>Solomon'</HI>s Proverbs; for <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e</HI> tells us, <HI>Wisdom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s the principal thing;</HI> and <HI>Better</HI> (says he) <HI>is a poor and wise Child, than an old &amp; foolish King,</HI> however great in dignity, or mighty in power. The good Man finds in the ways of religion the <HI>most solid</HI> pleasures, &amp; obtains the <HI>truest</HI> honours, and <HI>durable</HI> riches. He is <HI>rich towards GOD,</HI> a Favourite of Hea|ven, &amp; entituled to an <HI>Inheritance in Light,</HI> a King|dom of Glory; and when call'd out of this World, receives an <HI>open and abundant entrance</HI> thereinto. He then leaves behind him the <HI>Memory of the Just,</HI> which is <HI>blessed:</HI> He leaves his deceased <HI>body</HI> to take it's sweet <HI>rest</HI> in the unactive and impassible Grave, as in a bed of ease and honor, till the bright Morning of the Resurrection; while his <HI>better part,</HI> the immortal Spirit within him, in the moment of his dissolution <HI>returns to GOD,</HI> it's great Creator, Redeemer &amp; Judge; <HI>into whose hand</HI> the departing Saint resign'd it, and by whom it is <HI>received to Glory.</HI></P>
<P>HENCE from these blessed prospects of faith, the wise Preacher adds that noble passage, (the latter clause in our Text, and which only is design'd to employ our present Meditations,)&mdash;<HI>The day of Death is better than the day of one<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s Birth.</HI> He
<PB N="4" REF="002336_0005_0FDB2AD18662DB70">
speaks of bodily Death, and of natural Birth. He sets these two <HI>extreme</HI> points, <HI>one over against the other,</HI> without regarding the <HI>intermediate</HI> space; as if there was no more in the World, (so vain a thing he judg'd it,) but <HI>a time to be born,</HI> and <HI>a time to die.</HI> And (which is a paradox to foolish Sen|sualists) the <HI>latter</HI> he votes the more happy period. Not indeed that <HI>Death</HI> merely in a <HI>natural &amp; irre|spective</HI> sense, is better than one's nativity: Nor that it is preferrible with respect to <HI>all</HI> men, the bad as well as good: No; for to the <HI>wicked,</HI> Death is <HI>the King of Terrors;</HI> the beginning of never-ending Sorrows; the dark entry, into blackness of darkness; the wages of Sin, and the gate of Hell. As for them that <HI>die in their sins,</HI> it were <HI>better for such, if they had never been born.</HI>&mdash;The Expression then must be understood in a <HI>restrain'd</HI> and <HI>qualified</HI> sense. It is not every one, but the <HI>godly man</HI> alone, that is here spoken of, the man of a good Name, the man of Wisdom. The Day of <HI>such</HI> an one's death, is better to him, than the Day of his Birth. <Q>Tho' as to <HI>others</HI> there was <HI>Joy</HI> when Child was <HI>born</HI> into the World and where there is <HI>Death</HI> there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Lamentation;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Henry,</HI> in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</NOTE> yet as to <HI>our selves</HI> (that are call'd to die.) if we have so liv'd as truly to merit a <HI>good Name,</HI> the day of our Death is better than the day of our Birth.</Q></P>
<P>THIS then is the Lesson of Wisdom, now to be explain'd and apply'd; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P><HI>THAT to a godly Person, the day of his</HI> Death <HI>is (all things consider'd) abundantly better than the day of his</HI> Birth</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="002336_0005_0FDB2AD18662DB70">
DEATH in a <HI>physical</HI> consideration is a disso|lution of the vital union between Soul &amp; Body; and so is a terrible <HI>Evil,</HI> very shocking to humane nature. And it is yet <HI>much more</HI> horrible, consider'd in a <HI>theological</HI> sense, as a <HI>fruit of the curse</HI> and <HI>the rouges of sin.</HI> Absolutely &amp; simply consider'd, It is an evil, and an awful rebuke to mankind, having no goodness or worth in it. But <HI>relatively</HI> to <HI>Be|lievers,</HI> and in respect of the consequent state which 'tis a preface to, it's formidable aspect is <HI>chang'd,</HI> So or an <HI>enemy</HI> it becomes a <HI>friend:</HI> the <HI>curse</HI> being happily converted into a <HI>blessing.</HI> So that for the Believer <HI>to die, is Gain.</HI> The <HI>wicked</HI> indeed are great <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">osers;</HI> but the <HI>godly</HI> are unspeakable <HI>gainers</HI> by their dissolution. The advantages that accrue to them by Death, are infinitely preferrible to those which come to them by their Birth, and in their Life here.</P>
<P>THIS assertion in the Text is <HI>contrary</HI> indeed to the opinion of almost all mankind, who look up|on the day of <HI>birth</HI> as a day of <HI>joy &amp; gladness,</HI> and celebrate their own or Childrens and Friends birth|days with solemn feasts &amp; rejoycings: whereas they look on the day of <HI>death</HI> as a <HI>melancholy mournful</HI> time, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Pool</HI> in loc.</NOTE> and so|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">emnize the funerals of others with all expressions of sorrow, and entertain the prospect &amp; approach of their own Death with <HI>fear</HI> and <HI>trembling.</HI></P>
<P>HOWEVER it is a <HI>truth</HI> with respect to the <HI>Chil|dren of God,</HI> that their <HI>Death-day</HI> is infinitely pre|ferrible to their <HI>Birth-day,</HI> all Circumstances and Consequences of both consider'd: and this will e|vidently appear, if we run the comparison in a few particulars; all which I shall reduce under those two general heads:</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="6" REF="002336_0006_0FDB2AD7AB2F82F0">
1. DEATH delivers the Saints from those many <HI>Evils,</HI> which their birth was accompany'd with, or laid them open unto.</P>
<P N="2">2. AT Death the Saints exchange the <HI>Gools</HI> of the present life &amp; world (which their birth enter'd them into) for infinitely better Enjoyments.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>AT Death the Saints are deliver'd from the many</HI> Evils, <HI>which their</HI> birth <HI>was accompany'd with, or opened the way unto.</HI> The day of death puts an <HI>end</HI> to all those sufferings &amp; miseries, which their birth was the <HI>introduction</HI> to, or attended with.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THEY were born in Sin: but at Death they are discharg'd from all sin &amp; moral pollution.</HI> The <HI>Saints</HI> were born in sin, as well as others. Hence that Confession of the <HI>Psalmist,</HI> the man after GOD's own heart, in Psal. 51. 5. <HI>Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.</HI> And agreeably we read, in Ezek. 16. 3, &amp;c. <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> saith the Lord to Jerusalem, Thy birth and thy nati|vity is of the Land of Canaan, thy father was at Amorite, and thy mother an Hittite. And as for thy nativity, in the day that thou wast born&mdash;, tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> wast cast out in the open field, to the lothing of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> person,&mdash;polluted in thine own blood.</HI>&mdash;And now this moral pollution <HI>adheres</HI> in part even to the <HI>Regenerate,</HI> so long as they continue in this <HI>life.</HI> Hence that groan and exclamation of the A|postle, (personating the Saint, as he is generally understood) Rom. 7. 24. <HI>O wretched man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death!&mdash;</HI> In Regeneration there is a <HI>mortal wound</HI> given to this body of Sin in the Elect; but still the <HI>Princi|ple</HI> remains in them; all their life-long they find <HI>a
<PB N="7" REF="002336_0006_0FDB2AD7AB2F82F0">
law of sin in their members, warring against the law of holiness in their minds;</HI> and after all their weeping and praying and striving against sin, they can't get rid of this vexatious In-mate, while in the pre|sent world: Yea, they are often led aside, and led captive by this Enemy and Traitor within. <HI>There is not a just man upon earth, that d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">th good and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">in|neth not:</HI> but <HI>in many things they all offend;</HI> &amp; even <HI>when they would do good, evil is present with them.</HI></P>
<P>BUT what a happy <HI>Change</HI> will <HI>Death</HI> infer! Death will discharge Believers from all the <HI>remains</HI> of Sin in them, will purge out every corruption, and perfectly mortify every lust; and will bring them under a <HI>blessed Impeccability,</HI> or a happy ne|cessity of being completely holy. Death dissolves the earthly Tabernacle, and so it is cleansed wholly from the Leprosy that was cleaving to it. The <HI>body of sin</HI> is left behind with the <HI>body of flesh.</HI> After Death the Believer shall be perfectly sinless, spotless, and unblemishable. There shall not be the least possible vanity in his thoughts, or irregularity in his will, or saint in his affections, either with re|spect to GOD or Creatures.</P>
<P>AND this surely argues the day of the Believer's death, to be better than the day of his birth. For <HI>Sin is the w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">st of Evils;</HI> most subversive of the perfection of our nature, and destructive of our real happiness. It is then a blessed and glorious Change which is made at Death, and of ineffable advantage to the Believer; when he is deliver'd from this pernicious evil.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THEY were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in a state of Ignorance and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">;</HI> but <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> remain after Death.</HI>

<P>BUT now Believers (<HI>being found in Christ, not having on their own righteousness, but that which is of God by faith</HI>) die in the embraces of divine <HI>kind|ness.</HI> They <HI>fall asleep in Jesus:</HI> They die there fore in a <HI>justified</HI> estate, free from the condemning power of the law, and interested in the special fa|vour of GOD; being the heirs of his love, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> reconciled Father; having the gladsome light of his Countenance (many times <HI>sensibly</HI>) shining into their Souls; and every Divine Attribute speaking peace, and sweetly smiling upon them.

wear glittering Crowns of Glory on their heads; and are at an infinite distance from all possible in|jurious influences or assaults of the malignant Pow|ers of Hell and Earth.

The Saints at death pass into a safe harbour &amp; quiet haven, where they are beyond every rough sea, and no proud wave can dash against them, nor any tossing tempest or rude occurrent invade them ever, to disturb their sweet repose. This shews that the day of Believers death is better than the day of their birth; which usher'd them into a World of sin &amp; sorrow &amp; vexation, and brought them on this stage of vanity, where are scenes of care &amp; trou|ble and difficulty without number.</P>

<P N="1">1. <HI>DEATH translates the Elect into a state of</HI> Retribution; <HI>Birth only introduc'd them into a state of</HI> Probation.

However as to the sepa|rate <HI>Spirits</HI> of just men, these immediately pass out of the dark valley into the realms of light &amp; bliss; and are lodged safe in everlasting mantions of rest &amp; joy, magnificence &amp; beauty. <HI>Luk.</HI> 23. 43. <HI>This day</HI> (said the crucifyed JESUS to the penitent Thief on the cross with Him) <HI>shalt thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e with me in Pa|radise;</HI>&mdash;a place this, never stain'd with sin, nor shaded by any sorrow; a place design'd by infinite Goodness for the everlasting entertainment of God's Children; contriv'd by infinite Wisdom, created by infinite Power, and purchased by infinite Me|rit: every way becoming the glory and bounty of the great Giver, and conspiring to the happiness of the Possessors: a place all calm, harmonious, and serene, inconceivably bright, glorious &amp; ravishing; which needs neither Sun nor Moon to enlighten it; for <HI>the Lamb is the light thereof.</HI> Surely this trou|blesome and howling <HI>Wilderness</HI> is not worthy to be compar'd with the promised <HI>Canaan,</HI> that good Land, &amp; glory of all lands, the perfection of beauty.

<P N="4">4. <HI>DEATH advances Believers to infinitely higher</HI> Honours <HI>than any are born to or ever attain in this world.</HI> At Death they are fixed in the most honourable Station, and employ'd in the most noble &amp; exalted services; They are care<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">st in <HI>Abraham'</HI>s bosom: they <HI>sit down with Christ in his Throne,</HI> and share with Him in all His glory, (<HI>Rev.</HI> 3. 21. <HI>Job.</HI> 17. 24.)

<PB N="35" REF="002336_0020_0FDB2B0228DFF958">
Form a right judgment of both; get a fixed belief of the happy difference between them; and be often entertaining your minds with serious reflections upon the same. This will be of very profitable con|sequence divers ways; and particularly it will tend of preserve you from <HI>envying the prosperity of the wicked;</HI> for when you mark the peacefull end of the upright man, and consider the end of the ungodly, which is destruction, how can you but chuse with <HI>Moses,</HI> rather to suffer affliction with the people of GOD, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; and with the <HI>Apostle,</HI> esteem godliness with contentment to be great gain?</P>
<P>Furthermore, ENDEAVOUR <HI>to get <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> assu|rance of your title to the blessed privilege in our text.</HI> Be sollicitously enquiring, <HI>Will this be my happy case?</HI> If GOD shou'd now summon me to depart, am I ready to be offered; and is it proba|ble I shall find the day of my death better to me, than the day of my birth? Inquire what <HI>evidences</HI> you have of a right to this blessedness: labour to <HI>clear up</HI> your title, and get a well-grounded <HI>hope.</HI> Without this your <HI>state</HI> may be secure yet your <HI>frame</HI> justly sad and uncomfortable, both in life &amp; death. Wherefore give diligence to make your calling and election sure.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>LET Believers possess their souls in humble patience.</HI> The saints, when by an eye of faith they take a view of the unseen treasures and glories reserved for them in the coming world, are apt sometimes to grow too <HI>uneasy</HI> and <HI>discontented</HI> under the various trials they meet with here; and with inordinate eagerness to <HI>wish</HI> for their <HI>dismission,</HI>
<PB N="36" REF="002336_0021_0FDB2B03B56962B8">
even as <HI>they that watch for the morning.</HI> Hence some have not loved their lives to the death; and others have been tortured, not accepting delive|rance; knowing that they had in heaven a better and an enduring substance, and shou'd obtain a bet|ter resurrection.&mdash;<HI>Impatience</HI> under the delays of their departure is an extreme, that Believers do sometimes fall into: but it is very <HI>faulty,</HI> and not to be indulg'd; as reflecting too much on the wis|dom and goodness of divine Providence. Be pati|ent therefore, Brethren, unto the coming of the LORD. For ye have <HI>need</HI> of patience; that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ye have done the will of GOD, ye might receive the promise.&mdash; And verily since the promise is so great and precious, the Believer has need to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> patience and <HI>labor after it.</HI> There is danger of to multuous thoughts and impatient wishes, when he considers, that <HI>for him to die is gain;</HI> and that the day of his death is defer'd. But let him remember also that for him to <HI>live is Christ;</HI> and this will be the best argument to calm and quiet him.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>LET Believers be full of praise an thanksgiving to GOD, under the blessed prospect they have before them.</HI> You have all possible rea|sons for gratitude and praise; whether you con|sider the <HI>greatness</HI> of that good and happiness which expects you; or <HI>what divine love has done</HI> to pre|pare you for and entitle you to it; or how <HI>undeser|ved</HI> the favour; or what an astonishing <HI>distinction</HI> is made between you, and apostate Spirits with the common herd and unbelieving world of mankind <HI>O consider these things and praise the Lord.</HI> Bless his holy name, and say continually, Let GOD
<PB N="37" REF="002336_0021_0FDB2B03B56962B8">
be magnify'd! who hath delivered me from the power of darkness and translated me into the king|dom of his dear Son: who crowneth me with loving kindness and tender mercies: who will redeem my life from destruction, and preserve me unto his hea|venly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever, Amen.&mdash;O awake up to sing &amp; give praise; now beginning what will be your eternal employ|ment in the blessed world you are hastning to.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>SEE that you live a life of obedience, and walk as becomes your privileges and expectations.</HI> Are you the heirs of divine love; and do you look for such things, as a translation to heaven in the day of death, and a resurrection to glory in the day of judgment; <HI>what manner of persons</HI> ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness? See then that you endeavour to <HI>walk worthy of the Lord</HI> unto all pleasing: that you strive to answer your character, and live up in some measure to the ends and bonds of your redemption by CHRIST; being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the grace and knowledge of our Lord JESUS CHRIST: mourning over the deplorable remains of that sin and misery, which you brought into the world with you; sitting loose in your affections from all crea|ture-enjoyments; being watchful against sin; and very diligent that you may be found of your Judge in peace, without spot and blameless. In aword, as you expect to be distinguish'd from sinners in the happiness of your death; so let it be your care to be distinguished now by the holiness of your life; having your conversation in heaven, and not being conformed to this present world. The more
<PB N="38" REF="002336_0022_0FDB2B0A0F1B4F40">
holy your life is, the more happy will your death be.</P>
<P>Finally, <HI>CAST an eye of pity on the unbelieving Crowd: and do all you can that sinners may be brought to share with you in your blessed privileges.</HI> Look on them, whose life is among the unclean, &amp; whose end is to be cut off, unless seasonable repen|tance prevent; look on such, I say, not with <HI>scor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> and contempt, but with christian <HI>concern</HI> and com|passion. Let your <HI>bowels yearn</HI> towards them, when you see'em hanging over the devouring furnace nigh to cursing; &amp; <HI>save them with fear, pulling then out of the fire.</HI> Do all that in you lies to recover them out of the snare of the Devil, and save their Souls from being drowned in perdition. Instruct the ignorant, warn the unruly, and exhort th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> daily, while it is called, To day; lest any be harde|ned thro' the deceitfulness of sin. [<HI>Let Heads families particularly, thus deal with their Children and Servants; the care of whose souls is most solemn charged on them.]</HI> But above all things, my Bre|thren, <HI>carry them to the throne of grace</HI> in the arm of your faith and prayer; and earnestly plead with GOD, that they may be brought to repentance, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> visited with his salvation. O stand before GOD to speak good for them, and to turn away <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> from them. 1 Tim. 2. begin. <HI>I exhort therefore that first of all (i. e.</HI> as we say, by all means,) <HI>sup|plications, prayers, intercessions,&mdash;be made for a men;&mdash;for this is good and acceptable in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of God our Saviour.</HI> 1 Joh. 5. 16. <HI>If any man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his brother sin a sin, which is not unto death he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them the sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="39" REF="002336_0022_0FDB2B0A0F1B4F40">
not say that he shall pray for it.&mdash;</HI> Surely they have hearts of stone, who can see their fellow-creatures upon the brink of destruction; and do not lift up their fervent crys to heaven for them.</P>
<P>BUT the other branch of the exhortation is,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>TO the Unregenerate.</HI> O let sinners from what has been said, be concerned to <HI>get into the number of true Believers;</HI> that so the day of their death may be better, than the day of their birth. O unbelievers! GOD now calls you to repent, and turn unto him; to believe on his Son, and flee from the wrath to come, and get ready for the hour of death. And methinks, you have had sufficient mo|tive set before you to engage your speedy compli|ance with the call of GOD.&mdash;Know it; <HI>die you must</HI> sooner or later: so hath GOD ordained, &amp; his word is established for ever: The grave is the house appointed for all living; and when the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">-time is come, the dust shall return to the dust, and the spirit to GOD, that gave it. There is no resisting, no evading, nor deferring. In the many instances of <HI>mortality</HI> you have seen, more especially of late, you have had this lesson very convincingly read unto you. And many of you have lately been visited with <HI>Sickness;</HI> which is the beginning and presage of a dissolution. The LORD has chasten'd you sore: but he hath not given you over to death. The sor|rows of death compassed you, and the pains of hell gat hold upon you: you found trouble and sorrow. Then (it may be) you call'd upon the name of the LORD; and made vows to him in the anguish of your souls. And behold, the LORD hath dealt bountifully with you: you was brought low, and
<PB N="40" REF="002336_0023_0FDB2B0CB15706F8">
he helped you. O <HI>consider the</HI> patience <HI>of a good GOD in sparing of you:</HI> and hearken to his voice, <HI>both in your sickness and recovery;</HI> whereby he loudly calls upon you to consider your latter end and so to number your days as to apply your heart unto wisdom. <HI>O that there were such an heart in you!</HI> That you wou'd study the ends, and comply with the calls of Providence to you, both in your affliction and relief: that you may learn righte|ousness from his judgments, and by his goodness be led to repentance: be awaken'd to confess your sins and give glory to GOD; in whose hands your breath is, and before whose eyes are all your ways.</P>
<P>Consider, <HI>TO prepare for death is the most impor|tant business of life.</HI> Time is a trifle to Eternity; Earth is nothing to Heaven. The end of your being in this world is, by serving and glorifying GOD to prepare for another. The grand concern is to finish well, to die safely, and be lodged happily in the future state. It matters little how it fares with you here, if you are well-provided for hereafter. Eternal Salvation is the one thing needful. And nothing that is gain'd in the ways of sin, will coun|tervail the loss of that. Mat. 16. 26. <HI>For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in ex|change for his soul?</HI></P>
<P>Again consider, <HI>HOW inexcusable you will be if you die under the guilt and power of sin, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of salvation.</HI> For the way of peace, the path of life is plainly laid out in the Gospel. And the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ptre <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> mercy is held forth to you; many invitations and the most solemn calls given you in the word written
<PB N="41" REF="002336_0023_0FDB2B0CB15706F8">
and preach'd, to come unto CHRIST, that you might have life.&mdash;Salvation is tendered to you on the most gracious and condescending terms; the most fair &amp; reasonable. You have also divine help graci|ously offered, in order to your compliance with the terms; and if under a sense of your own weakness <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> unworthiness, together with the use of means, you ask the same, it will be granted you. Finally, The holy SPIRIT has been striving with you, and divine Patience has been waiting on you, to just astonish|ment. <HI>How inexcusable then art thou, O man, who neglectest so great salvation?</HI> How shall you escape? And what wilt thou say, when the Judge shall sum|mon thee to appear before his enlightned tribunal? Verily, <HI>those Scriptures will be fulfilled in you,</HI> to your shame and confusion,&mdash;<HI>How often would I have gather'd you,</HI> as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and <HI>ye wou'd not?</HI> Because <HI>I have called,</HI> and <HI>ye refused,</HI> I have stretched out my hand and none regarded; but ye have set at nought all my counsil, and wou'd none of my reproof: I also will <HI>laugh at your calamity,</HI> I will mock when your fear cometh.</P>
<P>Again consider, <HI>HOW miserable you will be if you miscarry at last.</HI> Your <HI>natural</HI> state is unspeak|ably miserable: but if you die in your sins, that word will be fulfilled in you, <HI>The last state of that man is worse than the first.</HI> When you come to <HI>taste of Death,</HI> you'll find it a <HI>bitter cup,</HI> full of fire and brimstone, and the wine of indignation; the dreggs whereof shall be wrong out &amp; given you to drink. The day of your death will be a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of perplexity; a day of

slaughter &amp; destruction by the Lord GOD of holy in the valley of darkness. <HI>In that day</HI> when you fear cometh as a desolation, and your destruction as a whirlwind, when distress &amp; anguish cometh upon you, then (saith the LORD) <HI>they shall call upon me, but I will not answer; they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> seek me early but they shall not find me:</HI> They <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> call upon me saying, <HI>Lord, Lord, open to us:</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> I will say unto them, <HI>Depart from me ye cursed I know you not.</HI>&mdash;In the dreadful minute, the your dissolution is accomplish'd, your guilty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> will drop down into the fiery Lake, and be over whelmed with consuming terrors.

The <HI>Gospel-advantages</HI> you have had, will astonishing <HI>aggravate</HI> your condemnation; and be as <HI>oyl to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fire,</HI> which makes the flame more intense and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">|vouring.

are provided for a happy removal. Now in order to this, two things are absolutely requisite; you must be interested in Christ, and born of the Spirit. Wherefore, You must,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>SEEK an Interest in CHRIST.</HI> If you would escape the wrath of GOD. &amp; die the death of the Righteous; you must get <HI>united to</HI> Jesus Christ <HI>by faith,</HI> in whom is all your safety &amp; happiness, and union to whom is the foundation of all Gospel|hope. He that believeth on the Son, hath life everlasting; but he that believeth not, the wrath of GOD abideth on him, and he shall not see life. Blessed are the dead, who die <HI>in</HI> the LORD. Them that sleep <HI>in</HI> Jesus, will GOD bring with him. There is no condemnation to them that are in Christ: in whom we have redemption thro' his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of divine grace.

<P N="2">2. <HI>YOU must seek after the New-birth;</HI> that you may be <HI>meet</HI> for (as well as have a title to) the inheritance of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aints in light, and be fit to enter into the holy presence of GOD at Death. Justification <HI>entitles</HI> you to this happiness: and Regeneration <HI>qualifies</HI> you for it.

<HEAD>A SERMON on NEW-YEAR's Day.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>EZEK. XLV. 18.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Thus saith the Lord GOD, In the first month, in the first day of the month, thou shalt take a young Bullock without blemish, and cleanse the Sanctuary.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MANY and various were the Rites and solemnities to be attended under the <HI>Ceremonial</HI> Dispensation. Most of Them were contain'd in the <HI>Mosaical</HI> Law of Commandments. But here in our Text we have a <HI>new</HI> Institution; which I don't remember to have met with before. It is the <HI>anniversary</HI> Solemnity of <HI>Cleansing the Sanctuary</HI> by a sacrifice of atonement in the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> of the Year. <HI>Thus saith the Lord GOD, in the first month,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>HERE 1. We may observe the <HI>Work</HI> assigned:</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Time</HI> fixed.</P>
<P N="1">1. HERE is a <HI>Duty</HI> prescrib'd; namely, <HI>The offering a sacrifice to GOD, for purging of the Temple.</HI>
<PB N="50" REF="002336_0028_0FDB2B1A1F199028">
The <HI>matter</HI> of the sacrifice was a <HI>Young Bullock without blemish.</HI> <Q>Being design'd for the <HI>Honour</HI> of GOD, who is infinitely <HI>perfect,</HI> it ought to be the most perfect in it's Kind, else we do not <HI>give him the glory that is due unto his name.</HI>&mdash;Moreover, This signify'd the complete <HI>strength</HI> and <HI>purity</HI> that was to be in CHRIST, <HI>the dying sacrifice;</HI> and the <HI>sincerity</HI> of Heart, and <HI>unblame<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|bleness</HI> of Life that shou'd be in <HI>Believers,</HI> who are presented to GOD as <HI>living sacrifices.</HI></Q> The Oblation was to be of the <HI>Fattest and Choicest;</HI> for GOD deserves our <HI>Best;</HI> and <HI>Wo</HI> to them who pre|sent unto Him only the Halt, the Lame and the Blind, the Torn and the Sick. <HI>Should I accept this of your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ands?</HI> saith the LORD. <HI>Cursed is the De|ceiver,</HI> who sacrificeth to the LORD a corrupt thing: For I am a great King, saith the LORD of hosts <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mal.</HI> 1. 13, 14.</NOTE></P>
<P>NOW the <HI>End</HI> of this offering was to <HI>make Recon|ciliation for the House of Israel</HI> to <HI>cleanse the Sanctu|ary,</HI> to expiate for the sins of the <HI>preceding</HI> Year; the Iniquities of the holy Things, both of the Priest|hood, and the Congregation: And also to <HI>bespeak the necessary Aids</HI> and Restraints of Divine Grace for the <HI>Future;</HI> that they might escape former Er|rors and Pollutions, and worship and serve GOD in a more holy and acceptable manner.</P>
<P>AND hereby They signified Their <HI>Repentance</HI> and Humiliation for what had been amiss in Them and in Their Performances in Time past: as well as Their <HI>Vow</HI> and Promise to be more watchful, faithful &amp; diligent in serving GOD for Time to come.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="51" REF="002336_0028_0FDB2B1A1F199028">
2. HERE is the <HI>Time</HI> appointed, even the <HI>first Day of the first Month.</HI> The work aforesaid was to be the <HI>annual</HI> Employment of the <HI>New-Year's Day.</HI> And 'twas Employment <HI>sutable</HI> to the Day, well-fitting the season; very <HI>proper</HI> work to <HI>begin</HI> the Year withal.</P>
<P>THE <HI>first Day of the first Month</HI> is a famous Day in Scripture, for many memorable Actions &amp; Events. 'Twas on <HI>this</HI> Day that <HI>Noah</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gen</HI> 8. 13.</NOTE> first <HI>looked out of the Ark,</HI> after the Flood, and had the joyful sight of the restored World. A <HI>happy</HI> New-Year's Day indeed was This.&mdash;'Twas on <HI>this</HI> Day also that <HI>Moses</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fx<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d.</HI> 40. 2.</NOTE> (the man of GOD) <HI>reared the Taber|nacle</HI> for Divine Worship; according to the Com|mandment of the LORD. And a <HI>good</HI> New-Year's Day's <HI>Work</HI> it was.&mdash;And 'twas on <HI>this</HI> Day that <HI>Ezra</HI> the Priest <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> 7 9.</NOTE><HI>began his Journey</HI> from <HI>Babylon</HI> to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> on the pious Intention to set up the House of GOD there, and to teach in <HI>Israel,</HI> the good Knowlege of the LORD. A <HI>good beginning</HI> of the New-Year!&mdash;And so was that in <HI>Hezekiah'</HI>s Time <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 29 17</NOTE>, when on the first Day of the first Month, he began to <HI>repair</HI> and purify the <HI>Temple,</HI> and set in order the Service thereof; having it in his heart at the same Time to covenant with the LORD GOD of Israel, that his fierce wrath might turn away from Them.</P>
<P>BY these and other Things, <HI>the first Day of the first Month</HI> has been <HI>signaliz'd,</HI> and hath contracted a sort of solemnity; and challenges a <HI>special Re|gard</HI> from Us, in the annual Reversion of it; not
<PB N="52" REF="002336_0029_0FDB2B1BA5E66098">
indeed a <HI>superstitious Observation</HI> of it as holy Time, but an Application of it to some religious Exercises, which at this Juncture are peculiarly seasonable. And accordingly it has been the laudable <HI>Usage</HI> of many serious Christians both ancient and modern, to <HI>distinguish</HI> this Day (in the Yearly Returns of it) by agreeable Exercises of Devotion: Which pious Custom they have found to contribute exceedingly to the inflaming their Zeal, exciting their Diligence, and promoting their attainments in Religion. And this Reflection (methinks) is Argument enough to <HI>recommend</HI> the Practice, were there no <HI>Scripture</HI>-Rule to <HI>enforce</HI> it. But I doubt not, The Precept in my <HI>Text</HI> is a sufficient Warrant. For tho' the <HI>Jewish Institution</HI> of a Sin-offering on a New-Year's Day be <HI>out of Date;</HI> Yet the general <HI>Reason</HI> of the Solemnity remains in full force. Christians are still to offer <HI>spiritual Sacrifices,</HI> tho' the Legal or Cere|monial be abrogated: and we have the <HI>same occa|sion</HI> as the <HI>Jews</HI> had, to solemnize the Beginning of the Year, by presenting these unto GOD. And will it not be our <HI>Reproach,</HI> to fall short of <HI>Them</HI> in Care of our Souls, and Duty to our great Master &amp; Benefactor?</P>
<P>BUT (to say no more here) surely it can't be amiss to begin the <HI>Year</HI> with Religion; with which every <HI>Week,</HI> yea every <HI>Day</HI> shou'd commence. GOD in the <HI>First</HI> and <HI>Best</HI> Being, and the supreme LORD of all our Time: Hence the <HI>First</HI> of every period and Season belongs to Him; and therefore the <HI>First-Fruits</HI> of the yearly Revolution should be consecrated to his Glory and Service.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="002336_0029_0FDB2B1BA5E66098">
BY <HI>the good Hand of our God upon us,</HI> We are are now arriv'd to the Beginning of another year, according to the common Account. And as it falls out in Providence, our New-Year's Day is the L<HI>ord's Day,</HI> [is Sacrament-Day with us,] and so is filled up with religious Dutys. Thus we begin the year with GOD.&mdash;Now <HI>the LORD keep this in the Imagination of the Tho't of our Hearts,</HI> and <HI>establish our way before Him:</HI> and grant that the Services and Entertainments of the present Day may have a good Influence on the whole succeeding Year: that, if we are <HI>spared this Year also,</HI> we may on the Sabbath, which will <HI>close</HI> the year, still feel the happy Impressions of this Sabbath, and have them abundantly increased.</P>
<P>THERE are special <HI>Meditations,</HI> religious <HI>Tem|pers,</HI> and <HI>Actions,</HI> which are eminently sutable to <HI>preface</HI> &amp; introduce the year withall. Wherefore I thought, to put you in Mind of These, and exhort you to them, would be a <HI>word in season.</HI> And the LORD grant it may be not only seasonable, but al|so <HI>profitable</HI> both to You and to Me, being <HI>mixed with Faith!</HI></P>
<P>MY Business now then is to direct you in, and excite you to, a good Improvement of a New-year's Day.</P>
<P>THE Method I shall go in is this; (1) I shall mention &amp; recommend some things respecting the year <HI>past.</HI> (2) Others that respect the year <HI>begin|ning.</HI></P>
<P>SOME think, this first Month has it's Name from <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">anua</HI> (the Latin for) a <HI>Door,</HI> because it is (as were the Door) the Opening or Beginning of a New-year.
<PB N="54" REF="002336_0030_0FDB2B1D1DC5BFF8">
But 'tis most commonly thought, it derives from <HI>Janus</HI> (a famous Person in heathen Story, supposed to be the same with <HI>Noah</HI> in sacred Histo|ry) who was wont to be painted with <HI>two Faces,</HI> which at once saw things past and future.&mdash;And agreeably <HI>this Month</HI> (that wears his name) has like him a <HI>two-fold Aspect,</HI> it points backward as well as forward. Accordingly the customary <HI>In|scription</HI> of the Year at present is <HI>Double;</HI> both the Year passing, and that advancing come into the usual Date of things. This may give us occasion, not improperly to take <HI>both Years</HI> under our conside|ration. Wherefore as propos'd before,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>I shall instance in some Dutys of Religion re|lative to the Year concluded;</HI> that very properly chal|lenge a place among the pious Exercises of a New-Year's Day. This indeed I wou'd <HI>defer</HI> to be the Matter of our Entertainment on the <HI>finishing</HI> Sab|bath of the Year; but that I know not whether <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> opportunities shall be continued so long; and pro|bably some of my <HI>present</HI> Hearers will <HI>then</HI> be gone down into the place of Silence. Therefore I shall <HI>prevent</HI> my self in saying,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>WE must</HI> look back <HI>on the Year concluded with Solemn</HI> Repentance <HI>for the many Sins &amp; offen|ces of it.</HI> We shou'd begin the present Year with Penitent Reflections on the Sins of the foregoing Year: Our <HI>own</HI> sins, that is; for we are call'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>judge our selves,</HI> and not others. Indeed we shou'd lay to heart, and sigh and weep for the Abomina|tions committed by others; because of the Dished nor done thereby to the Name of GOD, and also th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> we may not partake of their Guilt &amp; Doom, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="55" REF="002336_0030_0FDB2B1D1DC5BFF8">
that which I am now urging more especially, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s a deep Self-abasement and Humiliation for our own <HI>Personal</HI> Miscarriages, particularly in the last Year. We must be sensible, that we are <HI>daily</HI> sinning more or less in Tho't, Word, &amp; Deed, thr&ocirc; the influence of corruption within and temptations without. The sorrowful <HI>Experience</HI> of the most improved Saints on earth speaks loudly to the truth of this. 'Twas the complaint of a humble Penitent, <HI>My sins are more than the hairs of my head. Who can understand his errors?</HI>&mdash;Doubtless, if we strictly <HI>examine</HI> the Records of Conscience, and take an impartial view of the frames of our heart, and the manner of our conversation in the Year past, We shall all find we've been (some in a greater, others in a lesser degree) making sad work for Repentance and have heavy complaints to exhibit against our selves. <HI>In many things we all offend.</HI> In all things the very <HI>Best</HI> come vastly short of their just obligations. Are there not innumerable instances, wherein we can charge our selves, either with <HI>Omission of,</HI> or <HI>Negligence in</HI> Duty, or <HI>Contradiction to it?</HI> Can't we justly accuse our selves of greatly <HI>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">spending Time,</HI> and frequently foregoing desireable opportu|nities of doing and getting good?&mdash;Has not a <HI>quarter</HI>-part of the Year at least with all, and nigh <HI>half</HI> with the generality been altogether <HI>wasted</HI> in our <HI>Beds?</HI> Truly it is a very humbling consideration, that we've been oblig'd, for the relief of our impo|tent Nature, entirely to lose so many valuable hours in <HI>Sleep</HI> as we have, But it is matter of more sad Reflection, that so much preti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s Time has by many been spent in Sleep <HI>unneccessary</HI> in indulgence of

the Flesh; or <HI>unseasonably,</HI> as in the solemn Wor|ship of GOD, to the dishonour of his Name, and the wounding of their own Souls. O that all who are guilty in this point wou'd seriously reflect, and grie|vously resent their Sin!&mdash;But then we have in many <HI>other</HI> ways lost a great deal of our Time. It is to be fear'd, that <HI>some</HI> among us have in a manner <HI>wholly</HI> fool'd &amp; squander'd away the Year, having been <HI>idle every Day and all the Day,</HI> as well as Night: Slothful &amp; unprofitable Servants, who have <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">id their Talents</HI> in a Napkin, nay have to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> Lord's Goods</HI> in riotous living.

<P>THUS to <HI>begin the Year with GOD,</HI> is the most hopeful way to render it a <HI>good</HI> and <HI>holy,</HI> a <HI>prospe|rous</HI> and <HI>comfortable</HI> Year.

It is a proper and very effectual means to keep up a lively Zeal for GOD, to keep us close to Duty, to make us wise in the Improvement of our Time, and quicken us to an unwearied activity in doing the Work of the Year. Moreover, This is a way to <HI>engage the special Presence of GOD</HI> to be with us through the Year; which is the Source of all true Prosperity, and which we have absolute need of, to direct and protect us in all our Ways, to assist and succeed us in all our Undertakings, to supply our Wants, and sweeten out Enjoyments, to support us under Afflictions, and make every Event (whether prosperous or ad|verse) to work together for our real (that is spi|ritual) Good. These Benefits are the desirable Fruits of the Divine Presence; and what, a <HI>good beginning of the Year</HI> has a happy Tendency to se|cure unto us.</P>

<P><PB N="88" REF="002336_0047_0FDB2B47D5043020">

<P>THUS we see in part what were the Laws of this Feast of Tabernacles or In-gathering, and in some measure the Meaning of them. Now since <HI>Gospel-Duty</HI> is represented, in the fore-mention'd Prophecy of New Testament Times, under the notion of <HI>keep|ing the Feast of Tabernacles,</HI> this intimates <HI>what</HI> GOD <HI>expects from Christians,</HI> even that all those <HI>Graces</HI> be brought into Exercise and exhibited in their Lives, which were especially acted and signify'd in this Feast of old. Likewise, since this Feast was observ'd among the <HI>Jews</HI> in the <HI>End</HI> of the Year (according to the civil Calculation of their Year) and since it was prophesy'd, that <HI>Christians</HI> under the Gospel shou'd keep this Feast <HI>from Year to Year,</HI> at the times appointed for this Solemnity; it seems but an Ac|complishment of that Prediction, if at every Year's End we take Occasion to do something like obser|ving the Feast of Booths or In-gathering. Indeed the whole <HI>Life</HI> of Christians shou'd be a perpetual keep|ing the Feast of Tabernacles, in a spiritual and e|vangelical Sense. <HI>Every day</HI> we shou'd be worship|ing as in that Feast; Going to CHRIST, the true &amp; living <HI>Temple,</HI> with our spiritual <HI>Sacrifices,</HI> of Re|pentance, Prayer, Thanksgiving, Charity, and Obe|dience; Going <HI>up</HI> to CHRIST by lively acts of Faith; Going <HI>forth</HI> to JESUS <HI>without the Camp</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Heb.</HI> 13. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> by imitation of Him in Patience, Self-denial and Mortification; <HI>Dwelling in Tabernacles, as in the days of the solemn Feast</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hos.</HI> 12 9.</NOTE>, exercising a holy Con|tempt of things on the Earth, knowing that here

He would have them to know, that the <HI>Mul|titude</HI> of Sacrifices, they had been offering, wou'd <HI>not suffice;</HI> that they needed <HI>another</HI> and <HI>better</HI> Sa|crifice; that <HI>He himself</HI> was the only Sacrifice, ac|ceptable

and pleasing to GOD. Therefore on the <HI>last</HI> day, after a vast number of Offerings had been made, <HI>He stood forth,</HI> and called upon all, that (be|ing sensible of the <HI>Insufficiency</HI> of the legal Sacrifi|ces, and considering them as <HI>Types</HI> and <HI>Shadows</HI> of Things to come) still thirsted after something <HI>further</HI> (as necessary) to take away Sin and justify them in the sight of GOD: These (I say) He call'd upon, and invited them to come unto <HI>Him;</HI> whose <HI>Flesh is meat indeed,</HI> the great Sacrifice to be fed upon by Faith; and whose <HI>Blood is drink indeed;</HI> the Fountain, at which only the thirsty Soul (la|bouring under a sense of Guilt and Wrath) can have it's longing Thirst quenched.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>OUR Saviour might deliver this Invitation on the last and great day of the Feast, because then (as hath been observ'd) was a great (if not the greatest</HI> Concourse <HI>of the People.</HI> Much People were on this day gather;d together at the <HI>Temple;</HI> it being a <HI>Sabbath day,</HI> and the great day, when they were no longer oblig'd to dwell in their <HI>Texts;</HI> when they had taken their <HI>Fill</HI> of Mirth &amp; Feast|ing, and were now most at <HI>leisure</HI> to attend the public Worship.&mdash;Our Saviour then wou'd not miss or forego so special an Opportunity of doing Good: but took occasion now to preach the Gospel unto to the People; that many hearing, many might come to Him and be saved!

<P>HENCE our Savior <HI>takes his leave</HI> of the People, in the most proper manner, with this solemn Invi|tation in our Text.

If there be true &amp;c fervent De|sires, then the awakned Soul will follow hard after the LORD in the Way of his Appointment.&mdash;Let it be inquir'd then: Have you been soilici|tous &amp; studious to get rightly acquainted with the Gospel-method of Salvation by JESUS CHRIST? And have you given Diligence to comply with the Terms? Not objecting against them, nor discourag'd by any Difficulties in the way. &amp;c.</P>
<P>THUS let every one examine himself concerning the first thing, this spiritual Thirst. If your Desires be found thus qualify'd; if they have been placed on proper Objects, and been exerted in due Ways and Measures, (such as I have mention'd) then you have truly thirsted in the sense of the Text; and are such as CHRIST invites to come unto him; which is the subject of the next Inquiry.

<P>AGAIN, <HI>Have you been going to CHRIST, in the way of prayer?</HI> Have you gone daily to the Throne of Grace, and made known your Request by Prayer and Supplication; laying open all your Wants, and Griefs &amp; Fears, and spreading all your Desires before the LORD?

<P>FINALLY, Have you been waiting on CHRIST, in the way of his <HI>Ordinances, and the use of Means?</HI> Have you been searching the Scriptures, attending on the Word preacht, &amp; going from one Ordinance to another, stretching forth your hands to GOD, and seeking the LORD diligently?&mdash;We read (Psal. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">7. 9.) <HI>He satisfyeth the longing Soul.</HI> "The <HI>longing</HI>

Thus we shou'd ex|press our longing after CHRIST, and his Benefits. We must make due Improvement of all proper Means &amp; follow him in every Way of his Appoint|ment. We must go to the Wells of Salvation, to the Brooks of Water; and lay our Mouths to every Conduit-Pipe. If one Means will not do, then we shou'd try another; if the more ordinary fail, then apply extraordinary: and never satisfy our selves in any Duty or Ordinance, unless we meet with CHRIST (the desire of our Souls) therein, and of the Fulness that is in him, receive some pretious Gifts.&mdash;Now let it be inquir'd: Had it been thus with you, in the general Course of your Life past and particularly this last Year?

<P>LET me here apply all the foregoing Inquiries, and Counsels, particularly to such as have this Year met with <HI>Sickness, Bere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">oments,</HI> and the like.

Can we truly say, as the Psalmist did, <HI>It is good for me that I have been afflicted: Before I was afflicted, I went astray, but now have I kept thy Word.

<P>THUS much for the first general Head; the <HI>Ex|amining</HI> our selves with Relation to the Duties and Promise in the Text.</P>
<P N="11">11. LET <HI>it be a record of Exhortation to Sinners, that they would now hearken to the</HI> Invitation <HI>of our Saviour, and comply with the</HI> Duties <HI>requir'd by been in the Text.</HI> The Invitation of CHRIST is, <HI>If any man thirst let him come unto me.</HI> O let every Sin|ner see to it, that he get his Soul instamed with a spiritual Thirst, and go to the Lord JESUS CHRIST for spiritual Satisfaction.</P>

<P N="2">(2.) <HI>LET</HI> awakened thirsty <HI>Sinners</HI> go to JE|SUS CHRIST <HI>for spiritual Satisfaction.</HI> Such of you as are under Convictions, that have your Eyes open'd to see your perishing Condition by nature, and whose Souls are inquisitive and craving after the Waters of Life; Be directed and encourag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d to go to JESUS CHRIST for a supply as the hunted Hart to the Water-brooks, or the thirty Israelites in the Wilderness to the Rock smitten.</P>

that is spiritual, immortal and immutable; agree|ing with the Nature of the Soul, and proportionable to it's Necessities in our fallen State. Now all this Good is treasur'd up in CHRIST, and in Him alone. There is nothing of it in the Creature. The World is but a broken Cistern, that can hold no Water, nor yield any true Satisfaction: and if you seek any where among Carnal Objects for Refreshment; they will certainly deceive your Expectations. CHRIST is the Fountain of living Waters. All our springs are in Him. <HI>All Fulness dwells</HI> in Him: a Fulness of Sufficiency for Himself, a Fulness of Redundancy for Believers: a Fulness of Merit &amp; Righteousness; a Fulness of the Spirit of Grace &amp; Comfort; a Ful|ness of Glory. In CHRIST there is enough to sup|ply all our Wants, and to satiate our utmost Cra|vings. In him there is an <HI>exceeding Abundance</HI> of all Good, above what we can ask or think. Enough for You; enough for Me; enough for All that thirst: and infinitely <HI>more</HI> than enough. Joh. 4. 13, 14. <HI>Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: But whoso|ever drinketh of the water that I shall give him, shall never thirst: but the water that I shall give him, shall be in him a well of water springing up to everlasting life.</HI> Consider,</P>
<P N="2">2. You are invited <HI>to come to CHRIST for all needful supply &amp; satisfaction.</HI> The Good that is Fountain'd in CHRIST is communicable; and thirsty Souls are bidden to come unto CHRIST for it. He is not a Fountain sealed, and inaccessible: but a Fountain opened, and freedom of Access to it is allow'd yea, Invitations to repair unto it are gi|ven
<PB N="121" REF="002336_0063_0FDB2B6C8DF9F120">
CHRIST is exhibited, and offer'd to thirsty Souls, in the Word written &amp; preach'd: and there they are woo'd with much importunity to come un|to CHRIST, and accept of him. Isai. 55. begin. <HI>Ho every one that thirsteth come ye to the Waters Where|fore do ye spend your Lab us for that which satisfyeth not?

<P N="3">3. <HI>THE Invitation is back'd with many</HI> Promises <HI>and Assurances of Satisfaction in Case you will come.</HI> The LORD has oblig'd himself by the most invio|lable Promises, to make you welcome, to give you a kind Reception, and so supply all your Need ac|cording to his Riches in Glory, if you repair unto him in the Gospel-way of Faith and Repentance. Thus, Isai.41. 17, 12. <HI>When the Poor &amp; Needy seek Water and there is none, and their Tongue saileth for thirst, I the LORD will hear them. I the God of Israel will not forsake them. I will open Rivers in high places,</HI> &amp;c.

Life, and I will raise him up at the last day.</HI> Mat. 11. 28. <HI>Come unto Me, all ye that labour &amp; are weary, and I will give you Rest.</HI>&mdash;Thus you have many great and pretious Promises, to encourage your Faith &amp; Flight to CHRIST. And from hence you may be <HI>sure</HI> of meeting with a kind Entertain|ment, if you go unto Him. He hath expressly said, <HI>Joh.</HI>6. 37. Him that cometh to me, I will <HI>in no wise</HI> cast out.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>THE Invitation is most gratious, and conde|scending, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> well as the Offer</HI> universal. The Foun|tain stands open for all believing Comers, to partake at free Cost. No Exception is made against any thirsting penitent Soul, however vile &amp; sinfull. No <HI>Personal</HI> Merit is insisted on; No <HI>Price</HI> demanded, nor any <HI>Returns</HI> expected but those of Gratitude &amp; Obedience. You that are utterly unworthy, and have no Qualifications to recommend you, nor any Thing to tender as a valuable Consideration, are not|withstanding invited to come, if you thirst. So runs the Invitation, Isai.55. 1. <HI>He, </HI>every one <HI>that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no Money; Come,&mdash;without</HI> Money, <HI>and without</HI> Price.&mdash;And so stands the Promise, Rev. 21. 6. <HI>I will give to him that is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the Fountain of the Water of Life freely.</HI> O the abounding Riches, and astonish|ing Freeness of Divine Grace! Let every Soul be transported with this Thought; and hereby be per|suaded to close with CHRIST upon Gospel-Terms.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>YOUR going to CHRIST is undispensably</HI> necessary <HI>to your Participation in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the Promise.</HI> You must go to the Well of Salvation, &amp; draw water out of it, in the Gospel Way; Otherwise
<PB N="123" REF="002336_0064_0FDB2B73B21C1060">
you will never partake of the Waters of Life. If you do not drink of these living Waters, what will it profit you to have had the Discovery &amp; Offer of them made unto you? And you will never have them given you to drink, unless you go to CHRIST for them in the way of Faith &amp; Repentance. Unless CHRIST dwell in your hearts by faith, unless you receive him upon Gospel-terms, you will certainly miss of Satisfaction &amp; Happiness. Hence that Com|plaint of our Savior, Joh. 5. 40. <HI>Ye will not come unto me, that ye might have Life.</HI> Hence likewise that solemn Expostulation of the Apostle, Heb.2. 3. <HI>How shall we escape, if we neglect so great Salvation?</HI></P>

<BIBL>JER. XVIII. 20.</BIBL>
<Q>&mdash;<HI>Remember, that I stood before thee to Judas good for them, and to turn away thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> from them.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THESE are the words of <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> who (we may observe) was the <HI>last</HI> Prophet, sent to the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> Nation before their captivity in <HI>Babylon.</HI> He was one of the common Priests in <HI>Anathoth.</HI> He was advanc'd to the extraordinary office of a Prophet (in the days of good <HI>Josiah</HI>) when very <HI>Young:</HI> and continu'd a <HI>long whole;</HI> th&ocirc; not nigh so long as <HI>Hosea</HI> (the first writing Prophet, us some think) who is said <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Henry's Expos. of itself.</HI>&mdash;The Introduct.</NOTE> to have prophesy'd near Ninety Years. And yet <HI>Je|remiah's</HI> Book is <HI>larger</HI> considerably than his. We have reason to think that <HI>Hosea preach'd</HI> as much as he, and perhaps had as many <HI>Revelations:</HI> but there was not so much of his <HI>publish'd,</HI> or at least not <HI>handed down</HI> in the sacred Records. <Q>Many ex|cellent Prophets wrote nothing, and others but little; who yet were very useful in their day. And so in the Christian Church there have been many burning and shining Lights, who are not known to Posterity by their Writings; and yet were no way inferior in gifts &amp; graces, and servi|ceableness to their own Generation, than those that are; and some that have left but <HI>little</HI> behind
<PB N="129" REF="002336_0067_0FDB2B7952B615B8">
them, and make no great figure among Authors, yet were as valuable men as the more voluminous Writers.</Q> Men's natural <HI>Gentus,</HI> as well as <HI>Op|portunities vary;</HI> and to this may the <HI>difference</HI> in part be owing: th&ocirc; there is a special direction of Divine Providence in this affair.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Style</HI> even of the inspir'd Writers is very <HI>curious;</HI> the Spirit of GOD serving his own designs by the different genius and capacity of those&punc; <HI>by whom</HI> he spake, at sundry times and in <HI>divers men|ers.</HI> As <HI>Pan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &amp; Apolles, &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> under the <HI>New</HI> Testament are noted as very different Speakers; so were Hosea, Isaiah, and Jeremiah under the old.</P>
<P>HOSEA (as Criticks observe) us'd a Style ve|ry close &amp; sententions, peculiar to himself; and in some places it seems to be like <HI>Solomon's</HI> Proverbs.</P>
<P>ISAIAH used a Style more copious &amp; flowing, but incomparably curious &amp; polite, full of majesty, and full of oratory; sometimes sublime &amp; towering always elegant and lively. But</P>
<P>JEREMIAH was less of an Orator: his man|ner of speaking was more familiar, plain, and un|polish'd. However, there appears a great deal of holy <HI>flame</HI> &amp; server in his Preaching. He was a very painfull, faithfull, zealous Prophet. In the nineteen first chapters of his Book of Prophecies, we have some of his <HI>Sermons;</HI> (I suppose, in abstract; perhaps <HI>Baruck's</HI> Roll might have many of the En|largements) and here we find a Variety of the most pathetical Exhortations, with the most mo|ving Admonitions, Reproofs and Warnings. But all very little regarded by the Men of that gene|ration, to whom he preach'd. It was a great favour
<PB N="130" REF="002336_0068_0FDB2B8151704F48">
to the People, that this excellent Minister so long continu'd laboring in the word, and zealously af|fecting them. And yet it seems he had but little success in his Ministry; which is the melancholy Lot of many of the best Preachers in all times of the World. They had him a great while among them, but to very little purpose. They des|pis'd his youth, and regarded not his age. They gave him very base, harsh, and ungrateful Treat|ment. He seems to have met with more ill Usage and Persecution, than any of his brethren the Pro|phets. He calls himself <HI>a man of Contention to the whole Earth;</HI> and complains of his people, saying, <HI>Every one doth curse me,</HI> th&ocirc; I have done no man any wrong. Neither the innocence of the Dove, nor the Wisdom of the Serpent, cou'd secure him from unjust Calumny, Malice, and Ill will. As became a faithful Prophet, he set himself to bear Witness a|gainst, and to reform, the Corruptions of the Times: but was always oppos'd, and malign'd by his thank|less and ungenerous Country-men. They despis'd his preaching, sought to ruin his Reputation, and even to take away his Life. This in many places be pathetically complains of; and particularly in our Context, which I shall read to you, and make some brief Remarks upon. Verse 18 &amp; 19. <HI>Then said they, Come, and let us devise devices against Je|remiah: for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the pro|phet: come and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give beed to any of his words. Give heed to me, O LORD, and bearken to the voice of them that contend with me.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="002336_0068_0FDB2B8151704F48">
Now if we reflect, we shall find, that the <HI>Occasion</HI> of the People displeasure at the Prophet was his <HI>plain dealing</HI> with them, his faithfull reproving their Sins, and warning them of approaching Judgments. The occasion is hinted in the introductory word, T<HI>HEN said they,</HI> &amp;c. Which affords us this Obser|vation; That <HI>it is sometimes the Humour of a vain World, to be enrag'd at the Ministers of GOD, for their Fidelity and holy Zeal:</HI> because they don't prophesy smooth things, and flatter Sinners in their Carnality and Hypocrisy? but with plainness of speech tell them their whole Duty, sharply rebuke their Sins, &amp; set the awfull Threatnings of GOD before them; This kindles their Anger.&mdash;But what an <HI>unrea|sonable</HI> humour is this, and how very <HI>wicked?</HI> 'Tis as if the Patient shou'd fly in his Physician's face: and as if one shou'd rudely spurn at a Messenger from his Royal Master.</P>
<P>AGAIN, if we consider <HI>Who the Persons were,</HI> that thus malign'd the Prophet, namely <HI>Professors of Religion;</HI> we may very naturally observe, That <HI>Formalists</HI> in Religion, when their <HI>Lusts</HI> are <HI>touch'd and grated upon</HI> in the faithful preaching of the Word, do usually turn the vilest <HI>Haters</HI> of GOD's <HI>Servants,</HI> and shew the most implacable Enmity to them: and this many times under the cloke of sanctimonious <HI>Zeal</HI> and with a carnal dependence on their <HI>Temple-Privileges:</HI> For thus they insinua|ted. <HI>The Law shall not perish from the priest, nor Counsel from the Wise, nor the Word from the Pro|phet; Come, let us smite him, &amp;c.</HI> As if they shou'd have said, He is a <HI>false</HI> Prophet, and contradicts our Teachers, (who have the promise of GOD's perpe|tual
<PB N="132" REF="002336_0069_0FDB2B83CD8EFA50">
presence) and therefore 'tis no <HI>Injustice</HI> to op|pose &amp; persecute such a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">roubler of Israel:</HI> or he is but <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> Prophet; and whatever becomes of him, we shall yet have <HI>others,</HI> and enjoy our Church-privi|leges still.</P>
<P>AGAIN, We might observe, That when any are <HI>enrag'd</HI> at the Servants of GOD, it is too common for them to <HI>propagate</HI> their undue Prejudices among their Companions.&mdash;Then <HI>said</HI> they, come <HI>let us &amp;c.</HI>&mdash;They call'd on &amp; stir'd up one another. And by this unhappy means, the <HI>Wise Man's</HI> observation is too often verify'd, <HI>One sinner destroys much Good.</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN, We might note; Sinners often <HI>lay their heads together to plot</HI> against the Just. Then said they, Come, and let us <HI>devise Devices</HI> against Jere|miah; consult what to do and say against him.</P>
<P>AGAIN, It is observable; One <HI>common</HI> method of <HI>Revenge</HI> is <HI>Defamation &amp; Derision.</HI> They said, Let us <HI>smite</HI> him with the <HI>Tongue;</HI> heap Reproaches upon him, and make a Laugh at him; banter, bely, and expose him.&mdash;And thus <HI>Jeremiah</HI> afterwards complains they abus'd him. <HI>Chap.</HI> 20. 7., &amp;c. I am in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> daily every one <HI>mocketh</HI> me. For since I spake,&mdash;the word of the LORD was made a re|proach unto me.&mdash;Then I said,&mdash;I will not speak any more in his name. But his word was in mine heart, as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay. For <HI>I heardth defaming of many fear</HI> on every side: <HI>Report</HI> say they, <HI>and we will report it;</HI> all my Fa|miliars watched for my halting saying, Peradven|ture he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him, &amp; we shall take our revenge on him. But the
<PB N="133" REF="002336_0069_0FDB2B83CD8EFA50">
LORD is with me as a mighty terrible one: there|fore my Persecutors shall stumble, and be greatly ashamed, &amp;c.</P>
<P>WE may further observe; It is often the unhap|py <HI>fruit</HI> of Persons Rage &amp; Prejudices against the LORD's Ministers, that they <HI>despise</HI> their Preaching and disregard the solemn Messages of GOD deliverd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y them.&mdash;And they said, Let us smite him with the tongue, and <HI>let us not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> beed to any of his words.</HI>&mdash;They call them <HI>His words</HI> the Prophet's Persons under prejudice against Ministers, are apt to look on what they deliver, as the word of <HI>Man,</HI> and not the word of GOD: and accordingly turn a deaf ear to all their Admonitions; prophanely scoff at their Warnings and Reproofs; and revile them as only serving their own Passions, when per|swading by the Terrors of the LORD.</P>
<P>NOTE again, Sometimes the <HI>Masice &amp; Rage</HI> of <HI>Sinners</HI> proceeds to such a <HI>height,</HI> as to <HI>conspire he Death,</HI> and offer violence to the persons of GOD's servants. This was <HI>Jeremiah's</HI> C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">se; v.20. <HI>They free digged a pit for my soul.</HI> They took counsel to|gether, (as he tells us in Chap. 11. 19.) saying, let us cut him off from the Land of the Living, that his name may be no more remembred.&mdash;It was a <HI>true,</HI> but infamous Character given by our Savi|our of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> in his day, and was put on Record for the <HI>Jews</HI> shame and <HI>Christians</HI> admonition; <HI>Je|rusalem, Jerusalem,</HI> thou that <HI>killest</HI> the Prophets, &amp; <HI>stonest</HI> them which are sent unto thee, &amp;c. <HI>Matth. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> See also a like Charge upon them by the Apostle, 1. Thes. 2. 15.</P>

to <HI>require Good with Evil.</HI> Jeremiah complains v. 20. That <HI>Evil</HI> was recompensed him <HI>for Good,</HI> And so doth the Psalmist, Psal.109.4.

<P>THUS I've noted several things from the <HI>People's</HI> Carriage to the Prophet. Now let us see what was <HI>his</HI> Conduct under all this wicked and unsufferable Treatment.</P>
<P>HE <HI>sadly resented</HI> their evil Carriage, <HI>laid to heart</HI> their Perverseness &amp; dreadful Impiety; and was a <HI>mournful;</HI> Spectator of the Judgments coming upon them. This is imply'd in the Text, and fully express'd in many places. As where he says; My Soul shall <HI>weep in secret</HI> places for your Pride, and mine eye shall <HI>weep sore</HI> and run down with tears, because the LORD'S flock is carry'd away captive, And again, When I would comfort my self against sorrow, my heart is <HI>saint</HI> in me.&mdash;Oh that I had in the wilderness a Lodging-place of way-faring men, that I might leave my People! for they be all A|dulterers an assembly of treacherous men: and they bend their tongues like their bows for Lies &amp;c.

HE <HI>appeal'd to GOD,</HI> to vindicate his innocence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> apply'd to him for <HI>Redress</HI> of his Difficulties.

<P>WE may observe here in general, <HI>He makes his Complaint to GOD;</HI> and from hence infer,&mdash;<HI>When the Servants of the LORD meet with Reproaches and Vexations from Men, especially for Righteousness sake, their Way and Wisdom is to bring their case to</HI> GOD; to shew him their trouble, and pair out their complaint before him <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> 142. 2.</NOTE>, Thus did holy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> <HI>Hezekiah, Hannah,</HI> and others.&mdash;The Saints know that GOD is their chief <HI>Friend,</HI> and permits them to speak to him as a Man to his Friend: Unto whom therefore shou'd they unbosom themselves but to Him?&mdash;Moreover, they know, they may depend upon <HI>Secrecy</HI> with him: They can talk ever to <HI>him</HI> the frowardness, and follies of their Relatives or Neighbours, which Charity or Prudence requires them to <HI>conceal</HI> from Men.&mdash;Again, they know that GOD is infinitely <HI>wise &amp; discerning, king &amp; inparti|al:</HI> that he cannot mistake their Case or pervert their words; that he is acquainted with all their Ways, and knows their Thoughts even afar <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and will judge righteous Judgment.

over, they know that GOD is <HI>able &amp; ready to relieve</HI> the Oppressed, and <HI>hear the prayer</HI> of the Destitute: and therefore they make him their Refuge, who is a Patron of the Innocent: They spread all their Cures before him, and pour out their Griefs &amp; Re|sentments into his ear, &amp; bosom. By which means, they often obtain Peace &amp; Ease of Mind, and re|fresh their oppressed Spirits.&mdash;'This is a Method, which all in the present Case shou'd pursue. But then they must see to it, that they mourn in the'r Complaint after <HI>a godly sort.</HI> They shou'd make their Complaints, in a <HI>penitent</HI> and humble frame, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the hand of GOD, and acknowledging his Justice, in all they meet with: Also in a <HI>meek</HI> and patient frame; free from all sinfull Passions, re|vengefull Motions and rancorous Invectives: And in a <HI>durable</HI> frame; blessing such as curse them and praying for such as despitefully use them: Fi|nally, with <HI>hope &amp; trust</HI> in GOD; encouraging them|selves in the LORD: as <HI>David</HI> did, in his distress when <HI>the People spake of stoning him,</HI> I Sam.30. 6.</P>
<P>But now more <HI>particularly,</HI> we may observe what the Prophet <HI>says</HI> in his Complaint and Prayer to GOD. We have first that petition, <HI>Give bred to me, O LORD,</HI> He had before complain'd that <HI>the People</HI> whom he preach'd unto, were resolv'd to give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> unto him.

and th&ocirc; Israel be not gathered, yet their Re|ward is with GOD.&mdash;Or, Men wou'd not take no|tice of his <HI>Grievances,</HI> and do him Justice: he there|fore applies himself to GOD, who is a Refuge for the Oppressed; and refers his Cause to him, who is an upright Judge. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> d.

<Q>WHEN a professing People have by their Sins provoked GOD to Anger, it is a Duty in|cumbent on the Saints &amp; Servants of GOD among them, to use all proper means to turn away the Divine Wrath, and obtain a Recovery of the Divine Favour towards them.</Q>

<P>PROP. I <HI>GOD is</HI> angry <HI>with his own professing People, when they sin against Him.</HI> Sin exposes them, as well as others to the wrath and destructive ven|geance of the Almighty. An External Profession and Covenant-Privileges are no sure Defense of a People; no Screen from wasting Judgments, if they sin against the holy One of Israel. GOD sees Sin in his own People, as well as others: and the Provocation in them is not at all the less; nay, 'tis vastly greater,
<PB N="141" REF="002336_0073_0FDB2B8F29F10F80">
being aggravated by the Advantages they enjoy a boy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> others.&mdash;That GOD is angry at Sin in a pro|fessing People, might be evidenced from Divine De|clarations, Threatnings and Warnings; and from many sorrowfull Examples of Vengeance, &amp;c.&mdash;National Sins bring national Judgments every where. But if <HI>Israel,</HI> (the holy Nation) sin, they shall be punish'd <HI>seven times more.</HI></P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>WHEN GOD's wrath is kindled against a provoking People, He is yet</HI> reconcilable to them; ready to forgive, and to turn from the fierceness of his holy anger; easy to be intreated, and willing to reverse the sentence of wrath, upon the easiest and most condescending Terms. Hence when he is, angry at a People, he often spares them a while, &amp; only threatens and warns them, and uses means to prevent their Ruin. And when he comes to the Ex|tention, he ordinarily begins with fewer and lesser Judgments, proceedings gradually, from gentler strokes to severer scourges <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psal.</HI>78.38. Lav.26.18. &amp;c.</NOTE>. And he is represen|ted as not knowing how at last to give the fatal Blow, &amp; bring total Destruction, even on the obsti|nately, Impenitent, See. Hos.6.4. and, <HI>Chap. 11. 8, 9.</HI></P>
<P>PROP. III. <HI>THERE are certain Means and Ways to appease the Divine Angry, when incensed against a People.</HI> And these are <HI>Humiliation</HI> under the hand of GOD, <HI>Deprecation</HI> of his Wrath, and <HI>Reformation</HI> of Sin, the procuring Cause thereof. GOD hath so limited the Threatning, that if these Duties be generally attended by a People, they may expect a stop of Judgments begun. <HI>Jer.</HI>3. 12, 12. <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">cl.</HI>2. 12, &amp;c.

<P>PROP. IV. <HI>AMONG a prosessing People, even in times of the greatest degeneracy, there is ordina|rily a</HI> Remnant <HI>of GOD's faithful Saints &amp; Ser|vants.</HI> Thus at the times, which our text refers to, th&ocirc; all <HI>Religion</HI> seem'd in a manner to be lost among the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation; yet there was <HI>Jeremiah, Barach,</HI> and some few others perhaps, whose hearts, were right with GOD.&mdash;So in <HI>Elijah's</HI> time, when there was so little appearance of Religion among the Peo|ple of GOD, that <HI>Elijah</HI> complain'd, saying, <HI>I am left alone and they seek my Life;</HI> yet what saith the Answer of GOD to the Prophet? <HI>I have reserved to my self seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knie to Baal.</HI> And the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> speaking of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation in his day, says, <HI>Even so at this time also there is a</HI> Remnant <HI>according to the Electi|on of Grace</HI> <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI>11. 3. 4 5.</NOTE>.&mdash;<HI>Abraham,</HI> when interceding for <HI>So|dom,</HI> hop'd there were <HI>Fifty</HI> Righteous within the City: which Hope of his was not only owing to his <HI>Charity</HI> (the nature of which Grace is to hope all things, and to think all the Good it can) but was grounded on the <HI>common conduct</HI> of GOD's Provi|dence, in casting some of his Elect into the most wicked places, and in the most degenerate times to maintain a Seed to serve the LORD. And th&ocirc; there was not as <HI>Abraham</HI> hoped, Fifty of <HI>GOD's</HI> Chosen ones in <HI>Sodom,</HI> yet there was righteous <HI>Lot,</HI> and his <HI>Family</HI> in it.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="002336_0074_0FDB2B9094DDEB40">
PROP. V. <HI>WHEN GOD has a Controversy with his People, it is the Duty of all his Saints and Servants among them,</HI> to do what they can to <HI>turn away his wrath from them, and obtain a blessed Re|conciliation.</HI> In all approved methods they must do what in them lies, to recover the Divine Fa|vour, and secure the Divine Presence with such a People, which is all their Safety, Glory and Hap|piness. They shou'd <HI>thrust into the Gap,</HI> and stand between an offended GOD, and a provoking Peo|ple; doing their utmost by <HI>interceding</HI> with Him to stop the Current of his Judgments. And then likewise they should endeavor to <HI>repair the Breach,</HI> that Sin has made; and remove the provoking Cause of Divine Wrath, by using most diligently all pro|per means to effect a true and thorough <HI>Reforma|tion</HI> among a backsliding People.

<P>Wherefore,</P>
<P N="1">1. THE Command <HI>of GOD obliges them hereto.</HI> A divine Precept constitutes any thing a Duty. Now it is in several places of Scripture expressly <HI>en|joyn'd</HI> on the Saints to pray for the People of <HI>GOD,</HI> especially in a day of the LORD's anger. Thus; Psal. 122. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>pray for the peace of Jerusalem.</HI> So, Isa. 62. 6. <HI>Ye that make mention of the Lord keep not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and give him no rest, till be establish, and till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> make Jerusalem a praise in all the earth.</HI>&mdash;And in the New-Testament: Eph.6. 18. <HI>Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit, and because there unto with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and suppli|cation

for all Saints.</HI> Heb. 13. 3. <HI>Remember them</HI> (in Prayer) <HI>that are in bonds, as bound with them.</HI> Jam.5. 16. <HI>Pray one for another, that ye may be boal|ed.</HI> These are plain Commands to our purpose, &amp; evidently infer the Saints Obligation to the Duty before us. It is not then a matter of Indifferency, to be attended or neglected as Men please; but they are oblig'd to the doing of it, by the inviolable Au|thority of <HI>GOD,</HI> their great Lawgiver and King.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THIS is very pleasing to GOD,</HI> The LORD loveth the gates of <HI>Sion,</HI> and desireth it for his ha|bitation.

He for a long while keeps somes Reserves of Kindness for them; sympathizes with them under their Adversity; in his love and pity he long bears with and forbears them; and <HI>in all their affliction be is afflicted,</HI> as the Prophet tells us, Isa. 63. 9. And in such a case, <HI>He looks to see, if there be none to help;</HI> to call upon him in the day of trouble; to turn away his anger, and stir up his bowels, and set his wisdom &amp; power o'work, to bring Deliverance. Ezek.22. 30. <HI>I sought for a man among them, that should make up the Hedge, and stand in the Gep before me for the Land, that I should not destroy it.</HI>&mdash;If there are <HI>none</HI> to be found, the LORD is represented as bro't to a <HI>stand,</HI> and not knowing what to do: Isa.59. 16. <HI>He saw that there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> man, and wonder'd that

a Prayer, it renders them <HI>greatly belov'd,</HI> and very acceptable to him.&mdash;Which consideration affords a very strong argument to enforce the duty upon them: since they are bidden to <HI>chuse the things that please GOD,</HI> and to walk worthy of the LORD, unto all pleasing.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>THE Glory of GOD requires this of them.</HI> The Name and Honour of GOD is what his Saints shou'd be very <HI>tender</HI> of, and <HI>jealous</HI> for: This shou'd be dearer to them, than all other interests and concerns whatsoever: This challenges their <HI>first</HI> care and <HI>highest</HI> regards.

For he adds, (V. 9) <HI>Because of the</HI> house of

the LORD our GOD, <HI>I will seek thy Good,</HI>&mdash;Holy <HI>Jeremiah</HI> was sway'd by this argument, and there|fore made use of it to strengthen his faith, in plea|ding for Zion.

<P>IN praying for <HI>Israel,</HI> the Saints shew their <HI>Love</HI> to the House and Cause of GOD; and their <HI>Desire toward the Remembrance of his Name.&mdash;</HI> Besides, by their prayers to GOD, they make an open <HI>Acknow|ledgment</HI> of their dependence on him for needfull salvations, and their belief of his ability &amp; willing|ness to save his People, &amp;c. And thus they give him the <HI>Glory</HI> of his Sovereign <HI>Dominion, Power, Wisdom,</HI> and <HI>Goodness.</HI>&mdash;Moreover, hereby they discover a <HI>generous</HI> and <HI>enlarged</HI> mind; which is an ornament and glory to Religion, and ultimately reflects honor on GOD.&mdash;Which Considerations speak the duty of Prayer, to be very incumbent on the Saints, in a day of <HI>Israel's</HI> distress. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Regard</HI> they owe to the <HI>Glory</HI> of GOD, demands this of them.</P>
<P N="4">4. THE Regard, <HI>which they owe to the</HI> professing People <HI>of GOD, among whom they dwell, requires it of them.</HI> To illustrates this Argument, consider,&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>THEY</HI> owe <HI>a peculiar regard to the</HI> Wel|fare and Prosperity <HI>of the Place and People, where and among whom they dwell.</HI> The <HI>Public</HI> has a <HI>Right</HI> to the benefit of their <HI>Prayers,</HI> and all <HI>other</HI> good Offices. Every one shou'd seek the Good of the

Country and Community, where Divine Providence casts his Lot. No. man is born to <HI>seek his own things:</HI> but to <HI>serve his own Generation,</HI> according to the Will of GOD. Every one shou'd be a Well-wisher especially to the Land of his <HI>Nativity:</HI> and if it be <HI>Christian</HI> Land, all the Servants of CHRIST are under <HI>double</HI> obligations, to concern themselves for he welfare of it. Where there is <HI>near Relation,</HI> here shou'd be also <HI>tender Affection.</HI> All the <HI>Pro|cessors</HI> of Religion are very nearly <HI>allied</HI> to one a|nother. They are <HI>Fellow-brethren</HI> by Nature, as <HI>Men;</HI> and by religious Profession, as <HI>Christians:</HI> And it is requir'd of them, that they <HI>love</HI> as <HI>Bre|thren;</HI> having compassion one of another, being pi|tifull, and courteous, 1 Pet. 3. 8. Yea, they are Fellow-<HI>members;</HI> being all baptized into <HI>one Body,</HI> (1 Cor. 12. 13.)

Rom. 12. 15. <HI>keep with hem that weep.</HI> Heb. 13. 3. <HI>Remember them which suffer adversity, as being your selves also in the body:</HI> Members of one and the same Body with them.&mdash;Queen <HI>Esther</HI> (of glorious memory) so lov'd the <HI>Jews,</HI> (then the only professing People of GOD, and the Nation she be|long'd to) that when Royal Letters were written to destroy them, she <HI>put her L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">fe in her hand;</HI> and went in unto the King, uncalled, which was cont|ry to Law, to beg the Lives of her Nation; thus arguing with her self, (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">th.8.6.) <HI>For <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ow can I en|dure to see the evil that shall come unto my people

or how can I hear to see the destruction of my kind|red?</HI>&mdash;This Consideration was one motive of King <HI>David's</HI> noble Resolution, to seek the good of <HI>Jerusalem:</HI> Psal. 122. 8. <HI>For my brethren</HI> and com|panions <HI>sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee.</HI> So great was the Love of this good King unto <HI>Zion,</HI> that of her he says, (Psal.87. 7.) <HI>All my springs are in thee.</HI> Consider,&mdash;</P>
<P N="2">(2.) PRAYER <HI>is</HI> necessary, <HI>if they wou'd obtain from GOD the Mercies, which they desire, and the People need.</HI> The Saints must <HI>ask,</HI> if they wou'd <HI>receive;</HI> and <HI>seek,</HI> if they wou'd <HI>find.</HI> Even when GOD has <HI>promis'd</HI> to do great things for his People; yet for the <HI>exercise</HI> of their <HI>Faith,</HI> and to put ho|nour upon the Duty of <HI>Prayer,</HI> He demands that his Favours be <HI>asked</HI> for. Ezek.36. 36, 37. <HI>I the LORD have spoken, and will do it. Thus saith the LORD GOD, I will yet</HI> for this be inquir'd of <HI>by the house of Israel to do it for them:</HI> Some render it, for the house of Israel, or on their <HI>behalf.</HI> The <HI>Saints</HI> are the LORD's <HI>Remembrancers:</HI> They then shou'd, in the <HI>Name</HI> of the House of <HI>Jacob, inquire</HI> after GOD, and <HI>seek his face,</HI> in the day of trouble, Unless <HI>Prayer be made of the Church of GOD</HI> in such a season, a People cannot expect the Returns of divine Favour. Consider,&mdash;</P>
<P N="3">(3.) <HI>THE Saints have a powerful</HI> Interest in Heaven, <HI>and by their earnest prayers do often turn away Wrath from a sinful People.</HI> Long and happy Experience testifys to the Truth of the Psalmist's Observation, Psal.34. 15. <HI>The eyes of the Lord are up|on the Righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry.</HI> We have heard with our Ears, and our <HI>Fathers</HI> have
<PB N="151" REF="002336_0078_0FDB2B968DB1A550">
told us, what Answers of Prayer they knew in their days: and the holy <HI>Scriptures</HI> tell us, what the Prayer of Faith has done in the times of old; how it has many a time <HI>stay'd the hand of GOD,</HI> when listed up to execute vengeance.</P>
<P>THUS the fervent Supplications of holy <HI>Lot</HI> Ob|tain'd deliverance for <HI>Zoar,</HI> when the LORD con|demned <HI>Sodom,</HI> and the Cities about it, with an utter overthrow. Thus <HI>Moses,</HI> being man mighty in Prayer, often prevaled with GOD by his inter|cessions for the Salvation of <HI>Israel.</HI> Psal. 106. 23. <HI>He said that he wou'd destroy them, had not</HI> Moses <HI>his chosen</HI> stood before him in the breach, <HI>to turn away his wrath.</HI> Thus when <HI>Sennacherih</HI> invaded <HI>Judah,</HI> and thought to win the fenced cities there|of for himself, <HI>Hezekiah</HI> the King, and <HI>Isaiah</HI> the Prophet <HI>prayed,</HI> and cry'd to Heaven; and the <HI>Lord saved Jerusalem</HI> from the Enemy. So when the <HI>Jews</HI> were in Captivity, and the walls of Jeru|salem broken down, <HI>Nehemiah</HI> wept, &amp; fasted, and prayed to the GOD of Heaven, that he would grant him favour before the King of <HI>Persia,</HI> and incline him to smile upon his good design to rebuild the City and House of GOD. And in answer to his Request, the LORD so inclin'd the <HI>King's</HI> heart that <HI>Nehemiah</HI> has left it on record, <HI>The King granted me according to the good hand of my God upon me</HI></P>
<P>THESE Instances may suffice to show, that the <HI>Saints</HI> have a <HI>strong Interest</HI> in the Court of Hea|ven; and by their Prayers do often prevale to keep off, moderate, or remove Judgments from a People; and sometimes obtain a Reprieve even for places ripe for Ruin and devoted to Confusion. Indeed
<PB N="152" REF="002336_0079_0FDB2B980E95BFD8">
in some extraordinary cases, the LORD declares, as in Jer. 15. 1. <HI>Tho'</HI> Moses and Samuel <HI>stood before me. yet my mind could not be towards this people.</HI> And as in Ezek.14. 14. <HI>Tho' these three men, Noah</HI> Daniel and Job <HI>were in the land, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, saith the Lord God:</HI>&mdash;Yet these words plainly carry this <HI>Intimation,</HI> that such men have <HI>Power with GOD,</HI> and that he will <HI>ordinarily</HI> forgive much, and for|bear long, <HI>for their sakes.</HI> Hence when the LORD is unalterably resolv'd to bring speedy Destruction on a People, <HI>he bids his Servants not to pray for</HI> 'em any more; because he wou'd not be put to the pam of denying their ardent requests. See Jer. 7. 16.</P>
<P>Now since the Godly have such an <HI>Interest</HI> at the Throne of Grace; and since GOD <HI>expects</HI> their Intercessions; and the <HI>Public</HI> has a just <HI>Title</HI> to the benefit of them; it hence evidently follows, they <HI>ought</HI> to give themselves unto prayer &amp; supplication.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>IN so doing, they will consult their own</HI> Peace and Welfare. <HI>They shall not seek God's face in vain.</HI> If he grant the Petitions that they ask, they will have their share in the public Tranquillity and Prosperity: The prospect whereof shou'd encourage 'em to Prayer. Jer. 29. 7. <HI>Seek the peace of the city,&mdash;and pray unto the Lord for it; for in the peace there of shall ye have peace.</HI></P>
<P>BUT however, their Prayers shall return into their own bosoms, and shall not return empty. Ve|rily; it shall go <HI>well</HI> with praying Saints, th&ocirc; it go if with a sinning People, Such are sometimes <HI>ex|ampled</HI> from common Calamities. GOD orders the destroying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> not to touch them. They are
<PB N="153" REF="002336_0079_0FDB2B980E95BFD8">
<HI>mark'd for favor</HI> and protection. (Ezek.9. 4, 6.) And this prospect shou'd encourage them to pray. Zeph. 2. 3. <HI>Seek ye the Lord, all ye meek of the earth: it may be ye shall be bid in the day of the Lord's an|ger.</HI>&mdash;Howbeit, their prayers shall be accepted of GOD, and abound to their good Account in the day of the LORD. They are all hung upon the file; and shall be remember'd, and recompensed in that day when a Cup of cold Water given to a Disciple, shall not be forgotten, nor lose it's Reward. There is a blessed Promise in Psal. 122. 6. <HI>Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: They</HI> shall prosper <HI>that love thee:</HI> Which as it intimates, that they are <HI>not Zion's Friends,</HI> who do not pray for her welfare; so it as|sures a <HI>Reward</HI> to them that are her praying Friends.</P>
<P>HENCE from a principle of Self-Love, the Saints are strongly oblig'd to the Duty under considera|tion. Their own Interest is a Bond upon them, and bespeaks their diligent attendence to the Work.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>THE Saints are many times oblig'd to pray for their People, when a day of GOD's anger is passing over them,</HI> because their own sins have conspir'd <HI>to pull down Judgments upon them.</HI> The Sins of GOD's own Children, which in times of Temp|tation they fall into, are peculiarly offensive to the pure Eyes of his glorious Holiness &amp; Justice; and are instrumental, as well as the Sins of open and daring Transgressors, to kindle a fire in Zion, and call down Vengeance of a Place. The most zea|lous Magistrates the most faithfull Ministers, and even the best of GOD's people, can seldom acquit themselves from contributing to the publick guilt and misery, by their own personal sins, or by their
<PB N="154" REF="002336_0080_0FDB2B9E27E60CE0">
being someways accessory to the sins of others. Sometimes a <HI>Jonah,</HI> the LORD'S <HI>Prophet,</HI> the best man in the Ship, may more immediately occasion the Storm. Sometimes a good old <HI>Eli,</HI> the High-Priest of Israel, may by a criminal want of Zele, and a foolish Connivence at ways of wickedness, pro|voke GOD to make a Breach upon his house, and a dreadful Gap in the Walls of Jerusalem, Some|times a <HI>David,</HI> King in Israel, and a man after GOD's own heart, may by great transgressions provoke GOD to send a wasting Pestilence on his People, or lay them open to the devouring Sword. Sometimes a <HI>Solomon,</HI> the wisest man, may by his foolish ways provoke GOD to stir up Adversaries against Israel, and make a breach among the Tribes of his People. Sometimes an holy <HI>Hezekiah</HI> may, by the Pride of his heart, &amp; a criminal Ingratitude to GOD (as well as a wicked <HI>Manasseh</HI> by his Murders &amp; other horrid sins) have a peculiar hand in bring|ing wrath upon Judah and Jerusalem.&mdash;Thus the most eminent and faithful Servants of GOD may sometimes by their own Provocations help to lay open the Sluices of divine Vengeance, and make a Gap to let In Wrath upon a backsliding People. And it is very rare, that any of the Saints can ex|empt themselves altogether from this Imputation.</P>
<P>Now surely it must needs be very <HI>congruous,</HI> &amp; most agreeable to the Rules of <HI>Equity</HI> and <HI>Propriety,</HI> that GOD's Children and Servants deeply <HI>sym|pathize</HI> with a People under Afflictive visitations, which <HI>they themselves</HI> have been in a greater or less degree <HI>Instruments</HI> of procuring to them; and to deprecate those Judgments, which their own Sins <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> upon them</P>

<P N="7">7. <HI>THE Saints shou'd be led to this duty, by the</HI> Example <HI>of GOD's Servants in all Ages.</HI> They have the practice of the Saints in all times of the World to confirm them herein.

<P>BUT then if you wou'd be heard in your Suppli|cations, you must <HI>take heed how you pray.</HI> Let me hint a few things here, by way of Direction.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) YOU <HI>must pray,</HI> confessing <HI>the Publick Guilt: in the first place humbling your Souls before GOD for your own Sins, and then for the Sins of others.</HI> Herein you have holy <HI>Daniel</HI> for an Example, <HI>Dan.</HI>9. 20. I was speaking, and praying and confessing <HI>my Sin,</HI> and <HI>the Sin of my People Israel;</HI> and pre|senting my supplication before the LORD my <HI>GOD,</HI> for the holy mountain, &amp;c. His <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Con|session</HI> you may read, in the foregoing Context.&mdash;You have also the Example of pious <HI>Ezra:</HI> See the 9th Chapter of his Book. You have likewise the Example of godly <HI>Nehemiah;</HI> who when he pray'd day &amp; night, for the Children of Israel, did also <HI>con|sess the Sins of the Children of Israel; his own Sins, &amp; the Sins of his Father's House:</HI> the Sins of their <HI>Kings. &amp; Princes, &amp; Priests, &amp; Prophets, &amp; Fathers, &amp; all the People.</HI> See the <HI>first &amp; ninth</HI> Chapters of <HI>Ne|hemiah's</HI> Book. And the whole Book of <HI>Jeremiah's</HI> Prophecy, as well as that of his Lamentations, a|bounds with <HI>Humiliations,</HI> and with <HI>Consessions</HI> of the sins of GOD's People.&mdash;It has been the Tem|per &amp; Practice of the Saints in <HI>all</HI> Ages to mourn the Public Guilt, when asking for Publick Mercies; to confess the Sins of the Times &amp; Places in which they liv'd; the Sins of all Orders and Degrees of Persons; the Sins of Magistrates, Ministers and People. It is the Character of the Godly, that they <HI>sigh and cry for all the Abominations, that are done

in the midst of Jerusalem</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ezek</HI> 9. 4</NOTE>. Even thus must you (Our praying Saints) humble your Souls before GOD, for the Sins that are found among us; and in the name of our Rulers, and Priests, and People of all degrees, make penitent Confessions to the LORD, if you expect to be heard in your Suppli|cations for the Restoring of his Favor and Pity to|wards his Land.</P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>YOU must pray justifying of GOD.</HI> You must make such humble Acknowlegements, as those, to the Glory of GOD:&mdash;<HI>The Lord is righteous;</HI> for we have rebelled against his Commandment. It is of the LORD's <HI>Mercies</HI> that we are not <HI>consumed,</HI> because his Compassions fail not <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lam.</HI> 1. 18.&mdash;3. 22</NOTE>.&mdash;O LORD, <HI>Righteousness</HI> belongeth unto thee, but unto us <HI>Con|fusion</HI> of Faces, as at this day, because we have sinned against thee <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dam</HI> 9. 7, &amp;c.</NOTE>.&mdash;After all that is come upon us for our evil Deeds, Thou our GOD hast pun|ished us <HI>less</HI> than our Iniquities deserve. O LORD GOD of Israel, thou art righteous. <HI>We cannot stand before thee,</HI> because of our Trespasses <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ezra</HI> 9 13, 15.</NOTE>&mdash;Let not all our Trouble seem little: Howbeit, thou art <HI>just</HI> in all that is brought upon us; for <HI>thou</HI> hast done <HI>right,</HI> but we have done <HI>wickedly</HI><NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Neh</HI> 9. 33.</NOTE>.&mdash;Such Ac|knowledgments as these you must make, with GOD's Servants of old, when praying for this sinful People.

<P N="3"><PB N="162" REF="002336_0084_0FDB2BA43B120648">
(3.) <HI>YOU should mix</HI> Thanksgivings <HI>with your Prayers.</HI> Thus you are directed in 1 Tim. 2. 1. So in Phil. 4. 6. <HI>In</HI> every <HI>thing by Supplication,</HI> with Thanks|giving <HI>let your Requests be made known to God.</HI> Thus, devout <HI>Ezra,</HI> when confessing the People's Sins, rehearsing GOD's Judgments, and imploring his Mercies, took occasion to <HI>praise</HI> GOD for Delive|rance begun: Ezra 9. 8, 9. <HI>And now for a little space, Grace hath been shewed from the Lord our God,&mdash;to give us a little Reviving,&mdash;our God hath not forsaken us in our Bondage,</HI> &amp;c. So we read in <HI>Neh.</HI>9. 5. that the pious <HI>Levites,</HI> upon a solemn day of Fasting &amp; Prayer, began their Confessions of Sin with Thanksgiving and Praise, saying, <HI>Bles|sed be thy glorious Name, which is exalted above all Blessing and Praise, &amp;c.</HI> And afterwards they go on to celebrate <HI>particular</HI> Instances of Divine Good|ness. So likewise the 106th Psalm is a beautifull <HI>Mixture</HI> of Confessions, Prayers, and Praises. It principally contains a History of Israel's Rebellions and the Judgments inflicted therefor.

<P N="4">(4) <HI>YOU must pray</HI> in Faith: <HI>humbly hoping in the Promises of GOD, and entirely Depending on the mediation of JESUS CHRIST, for ob|taining the Favours you are asking.</HI> You must pray in the Faith of our Father <HI>Abraham,</HI> that emi|nent and famous Intercessor.

I Joh.5. 14. <HI>This is the Con|fidence that we have in him, that if we ask anything according to his Will, He heareth us.</HI>&mdash;You must bring the LORD JESUS CHRIST in the Arms of your Faith, hold him up as the expiatory Sacrifice, and the only Atonement for the Congregation; and place your whole Affiance in his Merits and Inter|cession for the Audience of your Prayers. Let your Supplications be offer'd up in the Name of the bles|sed Mediator CHRIST JESUS. Pray in somesuch Words as those of the Prophet <HI>Daniel,</HI> (Chap.9. 17, 18) <HI>O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant and cause thy face to shine upon thy desolate Sanctu|ary, for the Lord's sake. O my God, incline thine ear and hear&mdash;, for we do not present our suppli|cations before thee for our righteousness, but for thy great mercies.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>YOU must pray</HI> fervently <HI>and importunately.</HI> Tis the <HI>inwrought fervent</HI> Prayer of the Righteous, that avails much. They then, that would obtain the Blessing, must <HI>wrestle</HI> with GOD, and agonize in their Prayers, for the Peace &amp; Welfare of Israel. You must pray, as those that have at Heart the Public Concerns; as those that indeed desire not the wofull Day; as those that are affected with every Token of GOD's holy Anger, are afraid of his Judgments; and tremble at his wrathfull Presence. This made <HI>Moses</HI> so importunate, Deut.9. 18, 19.<HI>I fell down before the Lord as at the first, forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread, nor drink water: because of all your sins which ye sinned in doing wickedly in the sight of the Lord, to provoke

him to anger. For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the Lord was wroth against you to destroy you.</HI> The Prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI> was the more fervent in his Prayers for Jerusalem, because the Destruction from GOD, threatened to be bro't upon it, was a Terror to him. How pathetical &amp; melting are his Complaints, Jer.4. 19. <HI>My bowels my bowels, I am pained at my very heart,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;You must be under the like Impressions; and from aw|ful Resentments of the Divine Displeasure, as well as from tender Compassions to this poor afflicted People, you must be very earnest in your suppli|cations for them. Beware of Formality and Re|missness in your Prayers. As <HI>Israelites</HI> indeed, you must plead hard with GOD, and fill every one his mouth with Arguments. Take to your selves Words, and plead as in <HI>Dan.</HI>9. O LORD I beseech thee, let thine anger be turned away from thy City Je|rusalem, thy holy Mountain: because for our sins, thy People are become a reproch to all about us. O LORD hear; O LORD, forgive, O LORD hearken and do, defer not, for thine own sake, O my GOD; for thy city &amp; thy people are called by thy name.&mdash;Plead the Glory of GOD as <HI>Moses</HI> did, <HI>Deut.</HI> 9. 26.&mdash;19. And as <HI>Jeremiah</HI> likewise did, in those moving Words (in <HI>Jer.</HI> 14. 7, 8, 9, 19, 21.) which are too many to be here repeated.</P>
<P N="6">(6.) <HI>YOU must pray without Ceasing.</HI> You must continue instant in Prayer, and not faint, nor be discouraged. You must never hold your. Peace, day nor night. You must cry mightily to GOD, and give him no Rest, till he stir up his Strength and come, and save his People. Ye that make

Thus Jeremiah <HI>stood before</HI> GOD to speak Good for his Jerusalem; which may denote the <HI>Constancy,</HI> as well as Vehe|mency, of his Supplications.</P>
<P N="7">(7.) <HI>YOU must pray with due Resignation to the holy Will of GOD.</HI> Though you must be fervent and constant in your Prayers; yet you must not go about to limit the Holy One of Israel, or pre|scribe to Him, either as to Methods, or Seasons. You must intirely submit it to Him, in his infinite Wisdom, to answer your Prayers for Zion, in what Way, and at what Time he pleaseth. You must refer all to his good Pleasure, as the Psalmist, in Psal. 51. 18. Do Good <HI>in thy good pleasure</HI> unto Zion. You must leave it to Him to bestow what Good he pleases; by what Means, &amp; in what Season, he shall see fit. You must wait patiently for the LORD, without Discontent or Despondency under delays of favourable Appearances, As he Isa.8. 17. <HI>I will wait upon the LORD, who hideth his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him.</HI> It is said of him that <HI>believeth</HI> that he <HI>maketh not baste</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> Isai. 28. 16.</NOTE>, doth not impatiently anticipate the Time set in GOD's Counsils, but with a fixed heart quietly waits for his Salvation. Indeed there is a lawful provoking or calling on him to hasten; which has been practis'd by the Saints, as you see in <HI>Psal.</HI>70. 1, 5. <HI>Psal.</HI> 102. 13. <HI>Rev.</HI>6. 10. &amp; else where.

If a Professing People humble themselves under the Judgments of GOD, &amp; pray, &amp; seek His face, &amp; turn from all their evil ways; then will He hear in Heaven, and forgive their Sin, and heal their Land <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE>.

But unless there by a <HI>Public Repentance</HI> and tho'ro' Reformation among a sinfull People, they can't ex|pect the Recovery of Divine Favour. The Inha|bitants of the Land must themselves learn Righte|ousness from Divine Threatnings and Judgments; else the LORD will not visit them with his Salva|tion, not be appeased to them.&mdash;Hence the Ser|vants of GOD must use their endeavors to <HI>find out</HI> and <HI>reform</HI> those Sins and Sinners that provoke GOD to anger, if they wou'd prevent or remove the Effects of his fiery Indignation. It is remarka|ble, when <HI>Achan</HI> had committed a <HI>Trespass</HI> in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the Con|gregation of Israel for it, that <HI>Joshua</HI> and the Elders, betaking themselves to Fasting and Prayer, without sutable Care to find out and punish the Sin they probably suspected, met with that Re|buke from GOD, (Josh. 7. 10, &amp;c.) <HI>The Lord said to Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou upon thy face? Israel hath sinned; I will not be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed Per|son from amongst you. Up sanctify the People,</HI> &amp;c. This shou'd awaken the Saints to add unto their ar|dent Prayers the most active &amp; vigorous Endeavours, in their several Stations, and according to their re|spective Capacities, to effect a blessed Reformation among us; and oppose the growth of Vice and Li|centiousness, which is too much become the genius and Complexion of the unhappy Times we live in, to the great dishonour of GOD, the reproch of our christian Profession. the injury of our common

Welfare, and the danger of our being laid waste by yet heavier Calamities, unless a speedy and ge|neral <HI>Repentance</HI> Prevent. To promote <HI>this is</HI> there|fore the Duty of all, and will be the Endeavour of such as have a just Regard to the public Good.</P>
<P>BELIEVE it; without a tho'ro' Reformation there will be no Remission of the crying Sins of our Land; and unactive Wishes are not sufficient to obtain the desired Reformation. Indeed we must acknowlege and affirm constantly, that it <HI>belongs to</HI> GOD alone (as the efficient Cause) to revive dying Religion among his People. Means and Instruments can't by any Virtue or Efficacy of their own, pro|duce this great and noble Effect; but need a Divine Hand to actuate and Succeed them. It is only the Ministration of the Spirit, that can turn away Un|godliness from Jacob, and cause Righteousness to run down Jerusalem's Streets, as a River. And GOD expects to be <HI>inquired of,</HI> to be <HI>sought to</HI> by Prayer, till he come and bestow this comprehensive Blessing upon us. Nevertheless, he expects also, that his praying Saints use their utmost <HI>Endeavours</HI> in the Application of all those Means, that have a Ten|dency to the Revival of GOD's Work among us. You must study the best Methods or Expedients for this End, &amp; every one in his place, according to his Talent, put them in Execution. You must search out the impediments or Obstructions that are in the way; &amp; seek the speedy Removal of them. You must <HI>stand up for God against the Workers of iniquity,</HI> and la|bour to <HI>teach Transgressors his Ways.</HI>&mdash;Prayers and Tears are not all the Weapons, to be used in the defense of GOD's Cause among a declining Peo|ple:
<PB N="170" REF="002336_0088_0FDB2BAF5426FF20">
those are not the only Instruments, which the work of Reformation calls for. Unactive Suppli|cations are like be as successless and insignificant, as prayerless Endeavours. You must not sit still, and idly neglect the due Use of Means, looking that GOD shou'd do the whole Work alone. You must not fit down <HI>astonied,</HI> (as <HI>Ezra</HI> in a like case) sup|posing all Attempts desperate, and in vain. No; but GOD expects, that you be <HI>up &amp; doing;</HI> that in the strength of the LORD JESUS CHRIST you go forth to labor, and employ all your Opportuni|ties with Zele &amp; Vigor, in setting forward and car|rying on a Work of so great Importance to the Glo|ry of GOD, to the Publick Safety and Prosperity, as well as to your own Comfort &amp; Security. <HI>Suffer ye</HI> then <HI>the word of Exhortation;</HI> and let every one apply himself to the diligent performance of the Duty incumbent on him in his place.</P>

The Perfection of Beauty, and the Joy of all the Earth! May Glory dwell; in our Land, and peace be upon Israel, and the whole Earth be filled with the Knowlege of JESUS CHRIST. <HI>AMEN</HI></P>
