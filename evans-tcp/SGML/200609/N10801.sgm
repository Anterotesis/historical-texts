<HEAD>To the respectable Public.</HEAD>
<OPENER>Have a good End in view, and pursue it.</OPENER>
<P>EVERY Friend of American Freedom, rejoices to find a true and honest Spirit of Liberty Prevailing in all Ranks and Degrees in this City: It must even|tually prove our Safety; and a united Effort ought to be made for the Relief of a Sister Colony, now suffering in the general Cause. Deputies must be sent on our Part, and for God's Sake let us not dispute about the Mode of Election, but who shall most accelerate an Accommodation between the Parties. The Resolves are not material; whether we approve of the one Set or the other, is of no Consequence. Measures ought immediately to be adopted to procure Delegates to represent us at the Congress; they ought to be such as the Majority of the Citizens confide in; and, in order to ascertain this beyond any Doubt, I propose two Methods, either of which in my Opinion is unexceptionable.</P>
<P>First. That two or more Persons of repute (who are of different Sentiments as to the Candidates that have been proposed) be appointed in each Ward of this City, to take the Sense of the Inhabitants; that the Names of the seven Candidates be mentioned to them, and that they be desired to nominate any five of the seven they approve of, for Delegates: But in Case any Citizen does not choose to be confined to the seven nominated, he is to be at Liberty to name any five as Delegates, out of the City and County at large.</P>
<P>Second. On a Supposition that the above may be objected to, I propose that a Poll be opened in each Ward of this City, under the joint Direction and Inspection of the Committees of Correspondence and Mechanics, to take the Votes of the Citizens for five Delegates: The Poll to be conducted in the same Manner as for Election of Magistrates.</P>
<P>The Resolves adopted by the Committee of Correspondence, <HI>as now amended,</HI> will be approved of by many; so will the Resolves of the other Committee: In disputing which are best, and which ought to be adopted, we may lose Sight of our grand Object,&mdash;the Resolves agreed on at the Congress, must be binding, to render them effectual, therefore let us wait patiently for the Result of a joint Deliberation; but should a Number of Citizens be tenacious to have the Sense of the City taken which of the Resolves they choose to adopt, it may be done in the same Manner, and at the same Time that Delegates are appointed, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> by Subscription or Polling.</P>
<P>My good Citizens, I advise you not to be led a stray by any designed Publica|tions; consider your All is at Stake. Be assured I have nothing so much in View as a Reconciliation of Parties, which is really essential, in order to procure a proper Delegation, and convince the Enemies of America we are not to be cajoled either by their fair Promises or Threats, but will ever resist all internal Taxes that they may attempt to load us with.</P>
