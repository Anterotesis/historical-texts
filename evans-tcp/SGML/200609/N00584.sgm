<HEAD>To the Godly Reader.</HEAD>
<P>W<HI>E know that these Psalms, and Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, though in other Languages (and so consequently in other poetical measures) were inspired by the Holy Ghost, to holy men of old, for the edification and comfort of the Church, and People of God in all ensuing ages, to the end of the world. And for these holy ends, we have with special care and dili|gence translated them into such Meeters as are most usual and suitable for such holy Poems, in our own language, having a spe|cial eye both to the gravity of the phrase of sacred writ, and sweetness of the verse. And for fuller satisfaction of the godly desires of all, we have added sundry interpretations, according to the latitude of the significati|ons of the Hebrew Text, commonly noted with an Asterism thus [*] and some other various readings, though not so no|ted.</HI></P>
