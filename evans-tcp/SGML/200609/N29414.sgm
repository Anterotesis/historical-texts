<P N="2">2 That they are Di&s;tingui&s;hed by their Re|lative and Incommunicable Propertyes, or divers manner of Sub&s;i&s;ting, for it is Proper to the Father to beget the Sonn, and to the Sonn to be begot|ten of the Father, and to the Holy-Gho&s;t to proceed from both. <HI>Ioh.</HI> 1&middot;8. <HI>Ioh.</HI> 15&middot;26. <HI>Gal:</HI> 4.6.</P>

<P>Que&s;t: <HI>What is the rea&s;on that the Spirit worketh after this Order or method?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w:</HI> The rea&s;on generally is this,</P>
<P N="1">1 Becau&s;e as the great evill and cur&s;e that lyeth on all men by nature, is ignorance &amp; un&s;en&s;eble|ne&s;s of their &s;in &amp; mi&s;ery, hence the fir&s;t work of Mercy by the Spirit is conviction of &s;in, and humi|liation under their mi&s;ery.</P>
<P N="2">2 Becau&s;e as the next great cur&s;e &amp; evill, after men know their mi&s;ery, is ignorance and unbelief of the remedy: hence the &s;econd work of Mercy by the Spirit is conviction of Chri&s;ts Righteou&s;ne&s;s to be received by Faith.</P>
<P N="3">3 Becau&s;e when Chri&s;t is applyed by faith, the third great evill is ignorance &amp; weakne&s;s of walk|ing worthy of this grace and love of Chri&s;t: hence the third &amp; la&s;t work of the Spirit is to convince the &s;oul that therfore it is its duty to walk, and that he &s;hall be enabled to walk in all thankfull obedi|ence before Chri&s;t, all judgment being committed to Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>What therefore do you learn from hence, to be the principall care and study of your life?</HI></P>

<P N="2">2 That I may know the Remedy out of this mi&s;ery, Chri&s;t Je&s;us and his Rightou&s;ne&s;s, and by Faith apply it.</P>
<P N="3">3 Then to &s;tudy my Duty, how to walk thank|fully in all holy &amp; thankfull obedie~ce for this mercy</P>
<P>Que&s;t. <HI>Doth the Lord work thus by his Spirit in this order in all men?</HI></P>
<P>A. Yes; unle&s;s it be in an extraordinary way, and not by ordinary meanes. Becau&s;e it is expre&s;sly &s;aid in the text, he &s;hall convince the whole world of this.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>But is not by world, meant the wicked of the world?</HI></P>
<P>A. No; but the world of the Elect, as &s;ome|times they are called, 2 <HI>Cor:</HI> 5.19. For none of the wicked of the world are truly convinced of the&s;e things.</P>
<P>Q: <HI>What is it therfore to convince?</HI></P>
<P>A. To make a thing plain and evident to ones mind, by demon&s;trative argument; &s;o as that he hath nothing to object again&s;t it, for &s;o the word <GAP DESC="foreign"> &s;ignifieth.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>But what kind of conviction is here meant?</HI></P>
<P>A. 1 Not natural, which cometh by the light of natural con&s;cience, <HI>Rom:</HI> 2.15. But &s;piritual &amp; &s;upernatural: becau&s;e it is here expre&s;sly &s;aid, the Spirit &s;hall conuince &amp;c:</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="30" REF="039167_0031_10141AD574675820">2 Nor (yet) common &amp; ineffectual conviction for that tends to confu&s;ion of face, and to leave the men the more without excu&s;e, but &s;pecial &amp; effect|ual, unto the conver&s;ion &amp; &s;alvation of the &s;oul.</P>
<P>Que&s;t: <HI>How may that appear?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w:</HI> Becau&s;e no common work is attributed to the Spirit as a Comforter, throughout all the Scrip|ture as this is; for conviction of the &s;oul to con|fu&s;ion is no comforting act, but rather matter of mourning.</P>
<P N="2">2 Becau&s;e it is &s;uch a work of conviction, as whereby Chri&s;t comes to be glorified by the &s;oul, <HI>ver&s;e</HI> 14. which is no common worke.</P>
<P N="3">3 Becau&s;e the &s;cope of the words is to comfort the hearts of the di&s;ciples again&s;t Chri&s;ts ab&s;ence <HI>viz:</HI> that the Spirit &s;hall come, and thus convince the world; now it is no joy of heart to &s;ee men convicted &s;o farr only as may leave them without excu&s;e, and breed more confu&s;ion of face, but it is a joyfull thing to &s;ee the Spirit work on the hearts of a world of men to conver&s;ion.</P>
<P>Que&s;t: <HI>Why doth the Lord u&s;e this word convicti|on which is but an act of the mind &amp; under&s;tanding?</HI></P>
<P>A. 1 Becau&s;e words of &s;ence among the He|brews do allway imply affection &amp; action, and therefore conviction being a word of &s;ence, it im|plyeth &s;utable affections of the heart and therfore conviction of &s;in implyeth humiliation and &s;orrow of the heart for &s;in, conviction of righteou&s;ne&s;s im|plyeth

<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> To convince of Sin.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. <HI>Doth not the Law convince, and &s;hew a man his &s;in?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Yes; as an in&s;trument in the hand of the Spirit. <HI>Rom:</HI> 3.20. But the Spirit doth it as the principal agent by the Law.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>Is there not a natural conviction by the light of nature (or the light of natural con&s;cience) and not by the light of the Spirit?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes; <HI>Rom:</HI> 2.15. But the conviction of &s;in here is of a higher nature, it is &s;upernatural, by a &s;upernatural power of the Spirit.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>What difference is there between natural and &s;upernatural conviction of &s;in?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. Natural conviction by natural con&s;cience is much defiled and corrupted. <HI>Titus</HI> 1.15. It will &s;how &s;ome gro&s;s &s;inns, but it brings not to light tho&s;e which are mo&s;t &s;ecret, and mo&s;t dangerous; but &s;uper-natural conviction or the Spirit by &s;uper|natural conviction dealeth plainly, and di&s;covereth
<PB N="32" REF="039167_0033_10141AD8F5D05248">
the mo&s;t &s;ecret &s;inns of the &s;oul. 1 <HI>Cor:</HI> 15.14, 15.</P>
<P N="2">2 Natural conviction is u&s;ually dark and weak, without deep affection, becau&s;e it is a dim light; but &s;uper-natural conviction is &s;trong and over-powering and mightily affecting the heart. <HI>Acts</HI> 2.37. becau&s;e this is a clear light.</P>
<P N="3">3. Natural conviction if it be &s;ometimes &s;trong and affecting the heart, yet it hurries the &s;oul from God, it made Adam flee into the bu&s;hes to hide him&s;elf, it &s;ent Saul to the witch, and Judas to the halter. Becau&s;e natural con&s;cience is but the Ser|jeant of Divine ju&s;tice, before who&s;e throne it drags the &s;oule, and &s;o workes feare &amp; flight; but &s;uper|natural conviction inclines &amp; drawes the &s;oul unto God, and to &s;eek after Chri&s;t, becau&s;e it is the fruit of mercy from a mercifull Redeemer, from a com|forting Spirit.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. <HI>Why doth the Spirit undertake this work to convince of &s;in?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w</HI> 1. That the Lord Je&s;us might have all the glory of the conver&s;ion of a &s;inner, which is be|gun in this fir&s;t act of conviction, for if it were in mans power to convince him&s;elf of &s;in, then the be|gin~ing of mens conver&s;ion (which is conviction) &s;hould be attributed unto man, and &s;o Chri&s;t &s;hould not have all the glory.</P>
<P N="2">2 Becau&s;e no man can or will &s;ee his &s;in effect|ually untill the Spirit fir&s;t comes, becau&s;e without the Spirit men flatter them&s;elves in their evill wayes

<P N="2">2.

<P>Q. <HI>Why doth the Lord Ie&s;us u&s;e convince rather then humble?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. That he might &s;hew where true humi|liation begins, and that is in conviction.</P>
<P N="2">2.

<P N="3">3. To teach us that not only the great work of humiliation upon the heart is the work of the Spirit

but that the fir&s;t and lea&s;t beginings of it even the very fir&s;t &s;ight and conviction of &s;in is his work al&s;o, and not our own.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. <HI>What is there in &s;in, of which the Spirit convinceth and humbleth?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Three things. 1. The exceeding great evill and horrible nature of &s;in it &s;elf.</P>
<P N="2">2. The terrible wrath of God for &s;in.</P>
<P N="3">3. The pollution of the per&s;on that &s;inneth, that he is wholly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with &s;in, and univer&s;ally de|filed by &s;in in every thing be doth and is able to do, and all this becau&s;e he hath no part in Je&s;us Chri&s;t by Faith.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. <HI>What need is there that the Spirit &s;hould &s;et forth the exceeding evill of &s;in?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w</HI> Becau&s;e &s;in is that evill which principally grieves the heart of God, and therefore when the Spirit comes to correct &amp; humble for &s;in, he makes it to grieve our hearts mo&s;t, and to be exceeding bitter to the &s;oul. The Divels and reprobates, to whom the Comforter never comes, they feel the terrour of &s;in, but never feel the evil of &s;in.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>What need is there of conviction of the wrath of God?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That the &s;oul of man might be more deep|ly and &s;en&s;ibly humbled for &s;in the cau&s;e of it, for the heart of man being &s;en&s;ual, it cannot &s;o im|mediatly feel &s;in which is a more &s;piritual evill, but by means of Gods terrour, (as by the burning of the

<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Becau&s;e otherwi&s;e the heart would bee lifted up from what litle good it &s;eeth in it &s;elf, and never go to Chri&s;t for all good.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. <HI>What mea&s;ure of conviction and humili|ation for &s;in is nece&s;&s;ary?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> So much &s;ight and &s;en&s;e of &s;in is nece&s;&s;ary as may make &s;in a burthen un&s;upportable to the &s;oul <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 38.2. <HI>Math.</HI> 11.28.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>What nece&s;&s;ity is there of &s;uch a mea&s;ure?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. Becau&s;e &s;in and the wrath of God are in them&s;elves the greate&s;t &amp; mo&s;t un&s;upportable evills hence the &s;oul mu&s;t feel them &s;o, or el&s;e the Spirit &s;hould not let them feel them as they be.</P>
<P N="2">2 Becau&s;e Chri&s;t hath felt &s;in as a burthen un&s;up|portable, therefore the &s;oul mu&s;t feel it &s;o, other|wi&s;e it &s;hould not feelingly know what mercy Chri&s;t hath &s;hewed unto it in bearing &s;in for it.</P>
<P N="3">3. Deliverance from &s;in &amp; wrath of God, would not be matter of un&s;peakable joy, unle&s;s &s;inn was matter of un&s;upportable burthen.</P>
<P N="4">4. Becau&s;e &s;uch is a mans love of &s;in, and con|tempt of Chri&s;t, that he will never go to Chri&s;t to take &s;in and wrath of God away, while he can bear them quietly without intollerable pre&s;&s;ure under it:
<PB N="37" REF="039167_0038_10141B18B58DE278">
and therefore we &s;ee many that having only &s;ome co~victions &amp; light fears &amp; troubles for &s;in, they can ea&s;e them&s;elves by &s;ome light confe&s;&s;ion &amp; praying or by bu&s;ine&s;s, or &s;ports, or mirth, hence they live in their &s;in and mu&s;t peri&s;h for it.</P>

<P>Que&s;t. <HI>What nece&s;&s;ity is there for &s;uch unpeace|ablenes and re&s;tle&s;ne&s;s of heart?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. Becau&s;e if a cut finger or an akeing tooth will make men re&s;tle&s;s till they have ea&s;e, if there be any hope of ea&s;e, much more tho&s;e that feel far &s;orer evills upon them, if there may be any hope of help by Ie&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">2. Becau&s;e the end of all troubles in the Elect is to bring them to Chri&s;t, they mu&s;t come to him, <HI>John</HI> 10.16. Hence they mu&s;t be re&s;tle&s;s till they find peace in him, and can never be &s;ayd to be humbled if they can find any re&s;t without him: hence that promi&s;e, <HI>Mat:</HI> 11.28. is the fir&s;t and mo&s;t ordinary &s;upport and ground of comfort to an humbled &s;inner.</P>

<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Yes, and the rea&s;on is becau&s;e u&s;ually many judg of this re&s;tle&s;nes only by terrible afright|ments, when as there may be an intellectual &s;en&s;e of &s;in, or a deep apprehen&s;ion of &s;in and wrath in the mind and under&s;tanding, which may make the &s;oul re&s;tle&s;s without &s;uch affectionate affrightments As there may be great joy from a deep apprehen&s;i|on of &s;ome good, without laughing &amp; dauncing, and as there may be great affrightments without light, as &s;ometimes in a dream, &s;o there may be a great humbling light without affrightments, and violent raging fears.</P>
<P>Q. <HI>How may &s;uch come to know it that think they never have been thus affected with &s;in, and yet indeed have been &s;o?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Two wayes. 1. If the &s;oul doth e&s;teem Chri&s;t con&s;idered as a Redeemer from &s;in &amp; wrath of God, as the greate&s;t good, it is a certain &s;ign that &s;uch an one hath ben &s;en&s;ible of &s;in and wrath of God as the greate&s;t evill, though they &s;hould think they were never &s;o, for how el&s;e could deliverance from &s;in and the wrath of God be &s;o precious, if &s;in and wrath were not mo&s;t heavy; as (for example)
<PB N="40" REF="039167_0041_101467636B6AEDE0">
how can a man e&s;teem bread &amp; water as a greater good then all the gold and &s;ilver in the world, if he was not &s;en&s;ible of a hunger-bitten and thir&s;ty condition before.</P>
<P N="2">2. If any &s;oul hath a part in Chri&s;t without &s;en&s;e of &s;in (as he thinks) at his fir&s;t conver&s;ion, yet he &s;hall find that it was there indeed by his after conver&s;ions to God, for Peter and the re&s;t of the di&s;ciples, after they were converted, were to be a|gain converted <HI>Math:</HI> 18.3. Now many gracious chri&s;tians &s;hall find much &s;en&s;e of &s;in, and terrour of God affecting them all their life in their humili|ations before God which they neuer felt at fir&s;t, yet notwith&s;tanding the&s;e after-returnings do evident|ly &s;hew what ingredients were in them at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. <HI>Is not this conviction and humiliation a con&s;equent of faith, and following ones being in Chri&s;t?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> There is indeed &s;ome kind of conviction and humiliation for &s;in which followes faith, but in this place Chri&s;t expre&s;sly &s;peaks of that co~victi|on &amp; humiliation for &s;in which is wrought by the Spirit in the &s;oul becau&s;e it believeth not in Chri&s;t, and therefore is before faith is fully wrought.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. <HI>How may it appear that conviction of &s;in is the fir&s;t work of the Spirit?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w:</HI> 1. Becau&s;e none without this can feel their need of Chri&s;t and his righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;eek after him before they have him. For the whole need not a Phy&s;ician, but the &s;ick <HI>Math.</HI> 9.12.</P>

<P>Que&s;t. <HI>What u&s;e are you to make of this doctrine</HI> viz: <HI>conviction of &s;in?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> I learn hence, that the fir&s;t work of the Spirit upon the &s;oul, is not that my&s;tical Union which is between Chri&s;t &amp; the &s;oul (as &s;ome think) Chri&s;t doth not fir&s;t unite him&s;elf to the &s;oul, and then it is convinced of &s;in and humbled for &s;in, and then believeth in Chri&s;t, but the &s;oul is convinced of &s;in before this union; for if the Spirit fir&s;t con|vinceth the &s;oul of &s;in becau&s;e it believeth not in Chri&s;t, and con&s;equently becau&s;e it hath no part in Chri&s;t by any union to him; then the Spirit doth not fir&s;t unite the &s;oul &amp; Chri&s;t together, and after|ward convinceth it of &s;in. He that is united to Chri&s;t is in actuall favour with God, but he that believeth not is out of favour, condemned allready, and the wrath of God abideth on him. <HI>Iohn</HI> 3.18. <HI>Chap</HI> 3.36. if therefore the Spirit fir&s;t convinceth the &s;oul

of &s;in becau&s;e it believeth not in Chri&s;t, then be|cau&s;e it is out of favour with God, condemned all|ready abiding under the wrath of God, and con&s;e|quently not as yet united to Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. <HI>What evill is there in holding this opinion that the &s;oul is united to Christ fir&s;t before it be con|vinced and humbled for &s;in?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> 1. Becau&s;e by this principle, it is not fit to preach the Law to any of the Elect, to &s;hew them thereby their cur&s;ed e&s;tate: for if they be united to Chri&s;t before any conviction of &s;in by the Law, their e&s;tate is not cur&s;ed but ble&s;&s;ed, union to Chri&s;t being the root of all ble&s;&s;edne&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. Becau&s;e by this principle there is no need of preaching the Go&s;pel, to draw the &s;eperated &s;oul from Chri&s;t, to unite it to Chri&s;t: becau&s;e before conviction of &s;in, and therefore much more before conviction of Chri&s;ts Righteou&s;ne&s;s in the Go&s;pel, this union is &s;uppo&s;ed to be wrought.</P>
<P N="3">3. Becau&s;e by this principle one may be united to Chri&s;t, and yet have a heart corrupt and wholly united to &s;in: becau&s;e it &s;uppo&s;eth &s;uch an union to Chri&s;t which is before &s;o much as the lea&s;t &s;ight and &s;en&s;e of &s;in.</P>
<P N="4">4. Becau&s;e by this principle the &s;oul is united to Chri&s;t before it hath any faith either in the habit or act of it, which is expre&s;ly contrary to the Scrip|ture. <HI>Ephe&s;i.</HI> 3.17. <HI>Rom.</HI> 11 20. <HI>Iohn</HI> 3. la&s;t. for that pa&s;&s;ive faith which &s;ome &s;ay is concurrent to
<PB N="43" REF="039167_0044_10141B23B0C156A8">
our union, is but a meer &s;ound of words: for it is no grace indeed, but only that obedie~tiall or pa&s;&s;ive power of the &s;oul to receive the impre&s;&s;ion of the Spirit upon it as a mud wall doth an arrow or a bowle of water receiveth a ball of gold, which pa&s;&s;ive power is no grace but is in the mo&s;t repro|bate heart living.</P>
<P N="5">5 Becau&s;e by this principle, a man mu&s;t bee ju&s;tified, adopted, reconciled to God, not only be|fore faith, but even before he either &s;eeth or feel|eth his &s;in, or need of Chri&s;t: for at that in&s;tant a man hath his union to Chri&s;t, he hath communion nece&s;&s;arily in all the benefits of Chri&s;t, as Ju&s;tifica|tion, Adoption, Reconciliation, <HI>Rom</HI> 8.1. 1 <HI>John</HI> 5.12. But this is contrary to the whole currant of Scripture, which affirms that we are not ju&s;tified without faith, but by faith; and that not only de|claratively in the Court of our con&s;ciences, but in the Court of heaven, and &s;ight of God. <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.11. Al&s;o that we are adopted by faith. <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.26. and reconciled by faith. <HI>Rom:</HI> 5.1. <HI>Coll.</HI> 1.21, 22.</P>
<P N="6">6 By this principle a man may be in a happy and ble&s;&s;ed e&s;tate (becau&s;e united to Chri&s;t) with|out any Repentance or &s;orrow for &s;in, which is a ground of all loo&s;ne&s;s of life.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. <HI>But how can the &s;oul be convinced of &s;in or humbled for it, unle&s;s Christ be there to work both: and therfore it &s;eemes that Christ is fir&s;t united to the &s;oul before it be convinced of &s;in?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="039167_0045_10146770E68D2400"><HI>An&s;w.</HI> It is true, no man can be convinced of &s;in unle&s;s Chri&s;t work it by his Spirit, conviction of &s;in is a fruit or an effect of the Spirit of Chri&s;t: but it doth not therefore follow that it is a fruit of our union by the Spirit unto Chri&s;t: it is a fruit of the Spirit acting on the &s;oul as an efficient cau&s;e, but not a fruit of the Spirit as uniting the &s;oul to Chri&s;t and &s;o inhabiting or dwelling in it; Union it &s;elf to Chri&s;t is a fruit of the Spirit, but it is no fruit of a former union, &s;o conviction of the Spirit is a fruit of the Spirit, but not a fruit of union. The Spirit like a wi&s;e carpenter hews and cuts the &s;oul to make it fit for union, as he doth the beams of an hou&s;e; but this hewing &amp; cuting and hum|bling the &s;oul is no fruit of union, no more then hewing the rafters of a hou&s;e are a fruit of union to the main beam.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. <HI>If this conviction of &s;in be the fir&s;t act of the Spirit, what followeth hence in the &s;econd place?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> That the Law is fir&s;t to be preached to &s;inners &amp; unconverted per&s;ons before the Go&s;pell: For, if the Spirit doth fir&s;t convince the &s;oul of &s;in, the Law is fir&s;t to be preached, by which the apo&s;tle &s;ayeth wee come to the knowledg of &s;in. <HI>Rom</HI> 3.20 Not that the Law of it &s;elf can convince of &s;in but as it is an in&s;trument in the hand of the &s;pirit there unto; for if the Go&s;pel reveal nothing but Chri&s;ts righteou&s;ne&s;s by faith; then it cannot reveal a mans &s;in &amp; unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, and therefore the &s;pirit mu&s;t

<P>Q. <HI>What follows from hence, in the third place?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> That it is very dangerous to &s;hake off trou|ble of con&s;cience for &s;in, &s;o as to hide it, extenuate it, excu&s;e it, becau&s;e it is &s;uch a &s;in as quencheth the very fir&s;t motions of the Spirit, which appear fir&s;t in conviction and con&s;equently a great enmity a|gain&s;t the Spirit is &s;een in the&s;e.</P>

<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> No, for if the time of conviction of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s be before conviction of &s;in, then it is while a man is hardened in &s;in, and unbeliefe; but if the Spirit fir&s;t convinces a man of &s;in becau&s;e he believes not, (and con&s;equently that he is under con|demnation) then the Spirit never convinces a man of Chri&s;ts Righteou&s;ne&s;s, (and con&s;equently that he is freed from condemnation) before he believe. <HI>John.</HI> 3.18.

<P><PB N="53" REF="039167_0054_10141B304921D460"><HI>An&s;w.</HI> No; but really, for though Faith is not the matter of our ju&s;tification, yet it is the in&s;tru|ment (or in&s;trumentall means of aplying it) and therefore is before it, for if any &s;hould be really ju&s;tified before Faith, then it might be &s;aid there is no condemnation to &s;ome of them that be out of Chri&s;t Je&s;us who walke not after the &s;pirit, but after the fle&s;h, but that is directly contrary to <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.1.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. <HI>But what evill is there in this opinion to af|firm that ju&s;tification is before faith.</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> The &s;cope of it is that a man may be in an e&s;tate of grace &amp; actuall favour with God, and yet live in all maner of &s;in, without faith, and repen|tance, which is mo&s;t abominable, for &s;in can not have dominion over a man while he is under grace. <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.14.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. <HI>But doth not the Go&s;pel belong to &s;inners as &s;inners?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> The cur&s;e of the Law belongs to &s;inners as &s;inners, but not the promi&s;es. <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.10. And if the Go&s;pell belongs to &s;inners as &s;inners, then all &s;inners &s;hall be &s;aved throughout the whole world, the Go&s;pel indeed is offered to the vile&s;t &s;inner, but the promi&s;e of it is actually applyed to none but humbled and believing &s;inners.</P>
<P>Que&s;t. <HI>What followes from this?</HI></P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> That one rea&s;on why &s;ome are &s;o long before they &s;ee their ju&s;tification, is becau&s;e there is &s;ome flaw in their humiliation; un&s;ound humi|liation

un&s;ound peace, little humiliation, little peace in &s;ence of our ju&s;tification; for though an humbled heart hath many objections again&s;t believing, yet when the Spirit comes, he will convince you of righteou&s;ne&s;s as he did formerly of &s;in.</P>
<P N="2">2. That &s;ight &amp; &s;ence of &s;in &s;hould not di&s;cou|rage any one from believing in Chri&s;ts righteou&s;nes becau&s;e to &s;uch per&s;ons onely Chri&s;ts Righteo&s;ne&s;s is revealed by the Spirit.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence it followeth, that when a &s;inner is humbled he may then without pre&s;umption believe a proud and unhumbled &s;pirit cannot believe, an humbled &s;inner cannot pre&s;ume, nor yet believe too &s;oon; pre&s;umption is the proper quality of an un|humbled &s;oul, for if now is the time of Chri&s;ts reveal|ling his righteou&s;nes while the &s;oul is humbled, then it is the time of our aplying of Chri&s;ts righteou&s;nes without pre&s;umption.</P>
<P N="4">4. Hence it followeth, that an humbled &s;inner &s;hould not &s;eek fir&s;t for &s;anctification, but ju&s;tifi|cation, or a clear revelation of Chri&s;ts righteou&s;nes.</P>
<P N="5">5. Hence it followes the way to keep a&s;&s;urance of our ju&s;tification is to keep our hearts in an humbled frame, effectually convinced of &s;in; and therefore hate that doctrine as hell it &s;elf which under a colour of advancing the glorious e&s;tate of a Chri&s;ti|an in Chri&s;t, would not have him lament, mourn &amp; be humbled for &s;in; when as Chri&s;t dwels with a contrite and broken heart. <HI>I&s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> 57.15, 16.
