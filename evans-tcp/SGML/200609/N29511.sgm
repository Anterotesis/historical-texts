be rightly under&s;tood by you, e&s;pecially &s;ince I am again with drawn from you, being warn|ed of God &s;o to do, and that I may keep Truth clear, and my Te&s;timony thereunto, however cen&s;ured and looked upon by you, the great thing with me, is, and hath been, to approve my heart to God, and to &s;peak the Truth uprightly, without partiality of re|&s;pect to any Mans Per&s;on, and whil&s;t I am kept there, I heed it little who commends, or who di&s;commends me; for not he who commendeth him&s;elf, or whom another com|mends, but whom the Lord commends, that is approved; I &s;ay, that I may be the more Intelligible, and prevent and take off, what in me lies, tho&s;e evil and hard Con&s;tructions which very aptly and readily you may put upon what I there writ, as concerning <HI>Printing</HI> and <HI>Expo&s;ing,</HI> as hath been of late, both by one &s;de and the other, which I &s;hall explain, and give you my &s;ence, thus, That I have and can hone&s;tly and &s;afely te&s;tifie again&s;t &s;uch manner of Expo&s;ing as hath been of late by both, as that which ought not to be among&s;t brethren, who are to dwell together in Unity; yet if the Lord will make u&s;e of, or permit an In&s;trument to lay open &amp; expo&s;e a People for their Unfaithfulne&s;s, and for their trea|cherous dealing with him, who &s;hall then with|&s;tand the Lord in what he doth, who doth what&s;oever he will? and though men cannot

&s;ee it &s;o, yet what&s;oever the Lord doth, is well, and he is and will be glorified over all; and if he be not glorified in mens Salvation, he will be glorified in their De&s;truction, as he was upon hard hearted <HI>Pharoah</HI> and his people when he wrought that mighty deliverance for <HI>I&s;rael</HI>; for the Scripture &s;aith concerning <HI>Pharoah, For this &s;ame purpo&s;e have I rai&s;ed thee up, that I may &s;how my Power in thee, and that my Name might be declared throughout all the Earth.</HI> Thus you may &s;ee, in one &s;ence we may &s;afely condemn &s;uch manner of expo&s;ing, dividing, tending and tearing Member from Member, as that which ought not to be among Brethren, as the Apo&s;tle mentions in one of his Epi&s;tles, <HI>The&s;e things, my Brethren, ought not &s;o to be</HI>; &s;o &s;ay I, Brethren ought not to differ, fall out, and be at &s;trife, but all rather dwell together in Love and Amity, being all of the &s;ame Mind, and of the &s;ame Judgment; and this is very aimable, and a comely thing for Brethren thus to dwell together in Unity; but if that a People who have profe&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves to be in the greate&s;t Unity of any People be&s;ides, and all to believe the &s;ame things, profe&s;&s;ing the one Faith, one Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and one Hope of their Calling, if this People, or a part of them &s;hall be found in Error, &amp; certain men from among them&s;elves &s;hall ari&s;e, and &s;hall teach and a&s;&s;ert things contrary to &s;ound Doctrine, and &s;hall continue

and per&s;i&s;t to maintain &s;uch corrupt and erro|neous Principles and Doctrines, to the infect|ing and corrupting of one another, &s;o far as to the <HI>Denying of our only Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Christ,</HI> and if for this their great Dege|neracy, and contemning of the Word and Te&s;timony of Je&s;us, God &s;hall immediately concern &amp; rai&s;e up &s;ome from among&s;t them|&s;elves, to correct, reprove, reprehend, and &s;harply to te&s;tifie again&s;t the &s;ame, in the zeal and fervency of their Spirits, and al&s;o to with-draw from their Fellow&s;hip and Com|munion; and whether it be not right and ju&s;tifiable in the &s;ight of God &s;o to do, I leave to the Wi&s;e in heart to judge.</P>
<P>Thus you may plainly &s;ee I have and can freely condemn the Printing, Expo&s;ing, Se|perating &amp; Dividing one from another in the Church of Chri&s;t, and among&s;t Brethren, that it ought not to be, but in that other &s;ence, as I have told you, if the Lord doth it for a good end and purpo&s;e, to make manife&s;t Hypocrites and evil Workers, who live in Error, and to &s;earch out the hidden Workers of Darkne&s;s, and the Hypocrites in <HI>Zion,</HI> and who profe&s;s them&s;elves to be <HI>Jews,</HI> and are not, but do lye, and for the laying open Here&s;ie and Error, that hath long lain undi&s;|covered, that &s;o tho&s;e that are approved of him may be made manife&s;t; and if he will rai&s;e up &s;ome from among&s;t our &s;elves to do this

Work, which you account &s;o ill a Work, yet in this &s;ence, as the Lord doth it, in order to effect and bring to pa&s;s his own Purpo&s;e, I may not condemn it, it being the Day that I have much wi&s;hed for, that tho&s;e that are approved might be manife&s;t, and no place found where the Worker of Iniquity might hide his head; and the Day is come and com|ing&punc; that will find them out of all the dark Places and lurking Holes.</P>
<P>So, with little more, I &s;hall conclude, de|&s;iring the Lord, if it be his Will, to turn your hearts to him, and to work a true Reforma|tion and change in your Minds, that &s;o the thick Vail of Darkne&s;s and Error, that is over many of your hearts, may be effectually rent off and taken away, and that you may come to know the holy Covering of God, and to put on the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and to be cover|ed with his Righteous Power and Spirit, and then I know you will not be found naked, but might be able to &s;tand before the Son of Man.</P>

<P>Al&s;o, whereas it may look &s;trange that I lay &s;o deep a Charge upon &s;ome, as their <HI>Denying our only Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI>; I &s;ay, I know none that have done it in expre&s;s words, for in pretence they own him largely, but by nece&s;&s;ary and undeniable Con&s;equences they have done it, as can well be made ap|pear, not only by what mine Ears have heard, but by many more Ear Witne&s;&s;es with me, which the&s;e In&s;tances following are Evidences, <HI>viz.</HI> 1<HI>&s;t,</HI> Their Preaching publickly, <HI>That

the</HI> Jews <HI>did not &s;ee the Worlds Saviour</HI>; which naturally is to deny Je&s;us of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> the Son of <HI>Mary, Abraham</HI> and <HI>David,</HI> to be he, and contrary to his own words, <HI>John</HI> 6. and this received by the &s;aid publick Meetings and at the &s;ame time the contrary plain Scripture Doctrine and Te&s;timony, denyed and op|po&s;ed, as al&s;o at the next Monethly Meeting. 2<HI>dly,</HI> The Te&s;timony of <HI>G. Hutche&s;on, That Chri&s;t is now in Heaven glorified in the true Nature of Man,</HI> was oppo&s;ed by &s;everal Per|&s;ons in the publick Meeting, and &s;aid Meeting owned them therein. 3<HI>dly,</HI> In that <HI>G. H.</HI> hath been publickly oppo&s;ed, in te&s;tifying, <HI>That the great My&s;tery of Godline&s;s,</HI> (1 Tim. 3.16.) <HI>was God manife&s;t in the Fle&s;h of Chri&s;t,</HI> (the one had applyed it wholly to <HI>God being manife&s;t in our Fle&s;h to de&s;troy &s;in</HI>) and by one called a <HI>Novelty,</HI> and &s;aid, <HI>G. H</HI>'s <HI>Interpre|tation of &s;aid Scripture, was a Perver&s;ion, and giving his own, and a wrong Con&s;truction upon it, and an adding thereunto</HI>; and with hands &s;tretched out, <HI>Threatened him with the Plagues in Rev.</HI> 22.18. and this in a publick Meeting, and no one that I heard reproved him for it, but rather ju&s;tified him therein. The&s;e, with divers other In&s;tances that might be given, are Proof &s;ufficient, that you are greatly ig|norant of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whom God rai&s;ed again from the Dead, and hath &s;et him at his own Right Hand of Power, having al&s;o ap|pointed

a Day in which he will judge the World, even by the <HI>Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us, of which he hath given a&s;&s;urance to all men, in that he rai&s;ed him from the Dead</HI>; and whom&s;oever have the true Faith, believe, that God rai&s;ed from the dead, and that he was received up into Glory, That he that was dead is &s;till in being, and that he ever lives, and &s;hall come again in the Day appointed to judge all Man|kind; but this is denyed by them whom we are &s;eperated from, witne&s;s <HI>H.

<P>Now I have this advantage by my being la&s;t with you, That whereas you have endea|voured to make me and others believe, <HI>That its not for the Doctrine or Testimony's &s;ake that you have denyed us, but for Reviling, Printing and Expo&s;ing the Faults and Weakne&s;&s;es of Bre|thren,</HI> which I al&s;o am again&s;t as well as you, and have and can condemn it, &s;o far, That it ought not to be done again&s;t the true Bre|thren and <HI>I&s;rael</HI> of God; but Anti-chri&s;ts, and all Anti-chri&s;tian Practices and Principles are and ought to be born witne&s;s and te&s;tified
