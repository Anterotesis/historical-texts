<P>It must add much to the hap|pine&s;s of your pre&s;ent situation, that your example, being more generally known, will have a more general influence in form|ing the female character.</P>
<P>The influence of the female character, over the manners of civilized society, is a circumstance that exhibits female education in a point of light extremely inter|esting. On this consideration, may I not flatter myself that the &s;ubject of the&s;e Memoirs will

<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<P>I AM honored, my dear &s;ir, by the corre&s;pondence with which you favor me; and gratified, by the friendly man|ner in which you write to one, who can lay no other claim to your friend&s;hip, than that which ari&s;es from your benevolence. While your ob&s;ervations, on the princi|ples of &s;ociety and government, entertain, they improve the mind. There is a plea&s;|ure, in finding the &s;entiments of others accord with our own; and mutual advan|tage may ari&s;e, by an interchange of ideas, while glowing friend&s;hip becomes more ardent and more pure: there is a luxury in friendly intercour&s;e, unknown to vul|gar minds; nor can the vicious ever ta&s;te its pure&s;t delights.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="022570_0013_0FB99AD8D557FD40">THE &s;incerity of your friend&s;hip, I have never doubted; but am not &s;o ready to en&s;ure you again&s;t an imputation, on the &s;oundne&s;s of your judgment, in the pre&s;&s;|ing reque&s;t you make, for my "&s;entiments on a mode of dome&s;tic education, &s;uited to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;ociety, government and manners in this country." The &s;ub|ject is important; it involves all the be&s;t intere&s;ts of &s;ociety, of families, and of in|dividuals: but it has been the &s;ubject of &s;o much di&s;qui&s;ition; &s;o many treati&s;es have been written, and &s;o many plans laid before the world which promi&s;ed &s;ucce&s;s; that it may be deemed exhau&s;ted, and drained of all materials for fabricating a new &s;y&s;tem, or even for adding to, or im|improving upon, the old. Education, however, like an inexhau&s;tible fountain, may be drawn upon perpetually, without being drained: &s;ecret &s;prings will remain in this exten&s;ive and complicated &s;cience; and &s;ucceeding generations will explore their hidden channels, and greatly accele|rate the improvement of the human mind,
<PB N="15" REF="022570_0014_0FB99ADA30680F30">
the progre&s;s of virtue, and happine&s;s of the world: it is an art, a &s;cience, on which our being, virtue and happine&s;s &s;o much depend, that it mu&s;t ever be an object of anxious attention, with thoughtful and af|fectionate parents.</P>
<P>HITHERTO, education has been &s;o con|ducted as to contract the powers of the mind, by directing the current of intelli|gence in a narrow channel: the object of it has been to teach WHAT TO THINK, rather than HOW TO THINK. The end of education, is, to unfold the latent pow|ers of the human mind, direct them to &s;uitable objects, and &s;trengthen them by exerci&s;e: it is the art of preparing child|ren for the duties of life. The difficulty in giving a &s;y&s;tem of education would be comparatively &s;mall, if there was a general &s;imilarity in the circum&s;tances of men: but the&s;e being various, their &s;ituations and views vary with them, and occa&s;ion many exceptions to general principles, or rules.</P>
<P>IN order to conduct the bu&s;ine&s;s prop|erly, it is nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;tingui&s;h accurate|ly,
<PB N="16" REF="022570_0015_0FB99ADF302D7348">
the exceptions ari&s;ing from particular ca&s;es; and, which lead us to depart from general principles. Here a&s;&s;i&s;tance is mo&s;t needed; and here it is mo&s;t likely to fail: for the ca&s;es are &s;o numerous and complicated, that they fall not within the compa&s;s of imagination to conceive, nor of human &s;kill to arrange.</P>
<P>THERE are, indeed, general exceptions and variations, which may be di&s;tingui&s;hed with greater preci&s;ion, and le&s;s difficulty: tho&s;e which ari&s;e from difference in climate, mode of government, and general circum|&s;tances of &s;ociety. The &s;y&s;tems of educa|tion written in Europe, are too local to be transferred to America: they are generally de&s;igned for a &s;tyle of life, different from that, which it is nece&s;&s;ary for the inhabit|ants of the United States to adopt: they do not reach our circum&s;tances, and are not &s;uited to the genius of our govern|ment. We have already &s;uffered much by too great an avidity for Briti&s;h cu&s;toms and manners: it is now time to become independent in our maxims, principles of
<PB N="17" REF="022570_0016_0FB99AE23AF6A290">
education, dre&s;s, and manners, as we are in our laws and government. To promote this kind of independence, for which the late revolution opens a glorious theatre, &s;hall be my humble attempt, in the &s;equel.</P>
<P>YOU will be &s;o good, as to make my re&s;pectful compliments to Mrs. &mdash;, who, you inform me, is about to place her daughter at the female academy: the de&s;ign, I think, is laudable&punc; for I am con|fident &s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ll continue to exerci&s;e her in tho&s;e dome&s;tic employments, which will be u&s;eful in every condition and period of life. Much has been &s;aid on female edu|cation; and much remains to be &s;aid on that &s;ubject, and on the dignity and im|portance of the female character. I hope, in the cour&s;e of the&s;e memoirs, to con|tribute &s;omething towards re&s;cuing this gem from the &s;tate in which the pride or inattention of man has too long kept it; and without which all attempts to improve the mode of education will be vain.</P>
<P>IN my next, I will offer you &s;ome thoughts preparatory to the object in
<PB N="18" REF="022570_0017_0FB99AE332392D80">
view; and, in the mean time, mu&s;t &s;olicit your candor: for it will not be in my power to ob&s;erve rigid order, in the cour&s;e of epi&s;tolary writing, on a &s;ubject which involves &s;o great a variety of tran&s;actions.</P>

<P>I FELICITATE you, mo&s;t &s;incere|ly, my dear Sir, on this au&s;picious day,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">March 4th, 1789, commencement of the federal government.</NOTE> which exhibits to the world a government, founded in the empire of rea&s;on; a con|&s;titution, which, e&s;tabli&s;hed in equality and ju&s;tice, &s;ecures the rights of individ|uals, and promi&s;es the greate&s;t happine&s;s that can be derived from human in&s;titu|tions; committed to gentlemen of tried abilities and integrity, with tho&s;e at the head of the &s;y&s;tem, who&s;e fame for patriot|i&s;m and valor will live while the rights of men are dear to them; and who&s;e virtu|ous
<PB N="19" REF="022570_0018_0FB99AE790745760">
example will not fail of an happy in|fluence on public opinions, cu&s;toms and manners.</P>
<P>ENCOURAGED by the&s;e au&s;picious cir|cum&s;tances, I &s;hall proceed to &s;ome con|&s;iderations preparatory to my de&s;ign, with this unplea&s;ant a&s;&s;urance, after all that can be &s;aid, that the &s;ubject will not be com|prehended by &s;ome, and will be unattend|ed to by many: carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and ignorance will be the fault of many parents, and the ruin of many children. To addre&s;s in|&s;truction to the infant mind, and to con|duct that period of education, which may be called the &s;ea&s;on of impre&s;&s;ions, &s;o as to favor the main de&s;ign of it, requires much prudence and application.</P>
<P>IN America, children are generally reared up in a dome&s;tic &s;tate, and by their parents: few are put to nur&s;e; fewer &s;till committed to the care of private tutors. In general they are to be brought forward by the fo&s;tering hand of education, in tho&s;e little di&s;tinct &s;ocieties which u&s;ually con&s;i&s;t of parents, children and &s;ervants;

all of whom have a reciprocal influence upon each other: here the fir&s;t dawn of mental, as well as animal life commences. In this mixed &s;ociety, the mind is to re|ceive its fir&s;t tints; the models from which it takes fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions, &s;en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ments, and maxims, are always pre&s;ent&punc; in this &s;itu|ation, education is to be carried on through the &s;everal &s;tages of infancy, childhood, and youth, unto mature age. Here the &s;parks of genius are fanned or extingui&s;hed; the di&s;po&s;ition, like the flowing current, takes its cour&s;e; and hab|its are formed, which are carried into life.</P>
<P>NOT only the order and tranquillity of the dome&s;tic &s;tate; but of &s;ociety, depend on what pa&s;&s;es here.</P>
<P>THOSE who are accu&s;tomed, in their youth, to the re&s;traints of dome&s;tic di&s;ci|pline, will invariably make peaceable and worthy members of &s;ociety: their habits are &s;uited to the government of the com|monwealth, to who&s;e laws they will cheer|fully yield obedience: and that parent who leaves a family of children, early

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I name the family I have in view, it may not be ami&s;s to inquire in|to the nature of dome&s;tic &s;ociety, and the obligations which reciprocally bind each to the other. As they live together in the mo&s;t compact manner, in the&s;e di&s;tinct &s;ocieties, their mutual happine&s;s, as well as the progre&s;s of education, depends on
<PB N="23" REF="022570_0022_0FB99AF51BA8A488">
what pa&s;&s;es there. It is nece&s;&s;ary, there|fore, to con&s;ider the principles, on which this miniature of &s;ociety and government is founded; and to become acquainted with the rights and duties of the &s;everal departments of it. A more full illu&s;tra|tion of this will take place in the progre&s;s of the bu&s;ine&s;s before us.</P>
<P>WHEN the great Parent of the Univer&s;e brought Eve to the father of mankind, he doubtle&s;s had the happine&s;s of both parties equally in view; and to perfect their con|dition as &s;ocial beings, united them in the neare&s;t compact for life. Why, then, are not the married more generally happy? Becau&s;e their hearts do not beat in uni&s;on; they have &s;eparate plea&s;ures, oppo&s;ite di&s;|po&s;itions; and from trifling differences, which prudence &s;hould lead them to ac|commodate, proceed coldne&s;s and re&s;erve: feuds and animo&s;ities &s;ucceed; dome&s;tic enjoyment is forever bani&s;hed; and, the once peaceful dwelling, is turned into a &s;cene of perpetual ho&s;tilities.</P>

Riches and beauty may, for a while, &s;trengthen the tie; and good &s;en&s;e render it more permanent: but mutual felicity cannot be &s;ecure, without a &s;imilarity of temper and di&s;po&s;ition, a reciprocity of affection and &s;entiment; a "thought meeting thought," a "will preventing will." Parental affection can only have a genuine and permanent exi&s;tence, where there is a union of hearts. "The pa&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e who may be differently united, are, it is true, owing to the principles of nature; but mi&s;directed, or violently forced into unfortunate circum&s;tances.

<P>THIS affection, virtuou&s;ly founded, hav|ing the complicated charm and enchant|ment of that undefinable union which blends excellent minds, is among the mo&s;t glowing in all nature; and leads parents to regard a child's intere&s;t in preference to their own. On this affection, is found|ed that parental authority, which, in its nature, is ab&s;olute: but great prudence is requi&s;ite in the exerci&s;e of it: the &s;eat of this empire, &s;hould be in the affections, and not over the per&s;on.</P>
<P>TO the mother, nature has committed a mo&s;t important tru&s;t; the education of girls wholly, and of boys, until they be|come proper &s;ubjects for the regular di&s;|cipline of the father; on whom the wi&s;|dom of God, and the con&s;ent of all ages, have devolved the protection and govern|ment of this little community.

The mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences have followed from &s;uch conduct: the minds of children left uncultivated, with examples of vice continually before them, have grown up, like tho&s;e evil weeds that infe&s;t the neglected &s;oil, and become the pe&s;t of &s;ociety. Some, indeed, under all the&s;e di&s;advantages, have, by the &s;trength of genius, and the goodne&s;s of their di&s;po|&s;ition, gained their proper rank in the world; but many have fallen among the &s;plendid ruins of human nature, and been forever lo&s;t to the world.</P>
<P>BUT no man of reflection, or of benev|olence, will thus abandon tho&s;e he has cho&s;en for his inmates, or whom nature has committed to his care. He will uni|formly

Indeed, it would be impo&s;|&s;ible to do ju&s;tice to its owners, or fully to de&s;cribe the felicity of this dome&s;tic re|treat.

<P>NOT far di&s;tant, we&s;tward, &s;tands an inland town of re&s;pectable &s;ize. In the region of this &s;ettlement, lived the worthy parents of Mr. and Mrs. Bloom&s;|grove: the one a magi&s;trate of great in|tegrity, and activity in the di&s;charge of his office. He was literally "a terror to evil doers and a prai&s;e to tho&s;e who did well." The other, though a gentleman of public education, was a FARMER of great indu&s;|try, economy, and virtue; equally famed for genero&s;ity and beneficence. Both were patrons of the poor; promoters of knowledge and u&s;eful arts among all cla&s;&s;es of people. They were, e&s;pecially, atten|tive to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;chools for the benefit of the children of the poor as well as the rich; and by the&s;e means, learning was generally diffu&s;ed; the youth were not only pre&s;erved from the de&s;tructive effects of idlene&s;s and ignorance, but trained to knowledge, indu&s;try, and vir|tuous habits.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="022570_0034_0FB99B186EC4C358">THE hou&s;es of the&s;e worthy gentlemen, pre&s;ented an intere&s;ting picture of order and decorum: the education of their chil|dren had been an object of con&s;tant at|tention; and the effects of it amply re|warded all their endeavours.</P>
<P>IT, fortunately, happened that the eld|e&s;t child of one of tho&s;e families was a daughter; that of the other a &s;on: their education was &s;imilar, as it re&s;pected the principles of virtue, or the economy of life. They were &s;ent abroad to complete their education, and give a poli&s;h to their manners; but were not kept abroad &s;o long as to lo&s;e their knowledge, or reli&s;h for dome&s;tic concerns; or to acquire a fal&s;e ta&s;te, or romantic ideas. An early cultivation of the moral qualities of the heart, and a ta&s;te for acquiring u&s;eful knowledge, &s;ea&s;onably infu&s;ed, afforded them a balance again&s;t the &s;eductions of vice and the illu&s;ions of fancy.&mdash; I am agreeably interrupted by the arrival of your friend &mdash;, who&s;e tarry in this town will be &s;o &s;hort, that he will &s;carcely

<P>THE &s;imilarity in their age and ed|ucation, formed a congeniality of temper and &s;entiment, on which re&s;t mutual e&s;|teem and confidence: their hearts beat in uni&s;on, and accorded to every thing benevolent and good. They inherited the good qualities of their parents, and improved on their virtues. Their habits being fixed on the &s;ame principles and by &s;imilar cau&s;es, they conceived an early at|tachment to each other; which, being founded on mutual e&s;teem, grew by degrees into an ardent affection, and was followed by their marriage on the evening of the 27th of October, in the year &mdash;. Now

had the rolling &s;ea&s;ons crowned the ex|pectations of the hu&s;bandman, and amply rewarded all his toil: prolific nature had poured a profu&s;ion of her delicious fruits into the lap of indu&s;try, gladdening every heart with a portion of her goods. Such was the flattering &s;ea&s;on of their nuptials&mdash; joy &s;parkled in every eye, at beholding the union of the happy pair; in whom they anticipated the virtues of their excellent ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>THEY were not di&s;appointed in their expectations: like the opening flower, that gradually unfolds to the &s;un, their virtues expanded on every occa&s;ion, and came forth to view. The incidents of life, fell in train, &s;o as to &s;trike out the latent qualities of the heart, and produce great and worthy actions. Education too often contracts the affections to the narrow cir|cle of kindred and family connexions: but this is a degree of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s unknown to generous minds. But, theirs had been conducted on &s;o liberal a plan, that, while they were attached to their connexions, their genial influence extended to all around them.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="022570_0037_0FB99B20DD17A990">EDUCATION, properly managed, has reference to every relation in life: it teaches to think and act on a large &s;cale; and to di&s;charge the duties of every rela|tion and circum&s;tance in life with fidelity.

Into all the&s;e &s;hapes, will that philanthrophy, which &s;uch an education in&s;pires, tran&s;|form it&s;elf, as occa&s;ion requires. Indeed, love, like the law of attraction, operates more forcibly upon tho&s;e who are nearly allied to us by the ties of nature, than tho&s;e at a di&s;tance, or tho&s;e with whom we have no connexion.

<P>NOT only their friends and neighbors, but others at a di&s;tance from this region of ho&s;pitality, felt the effects of their benefi|cence.

<P>MR. Bloom&s;grove would have been hap|py to have confined him&s;elf to his farm and dome&s;tic concerns; but his talents were too con&s;picuous to pa&s;s long unno|ticed. He early di&s;covered marks of brilliant genius; and &s;hewed he had a &s;oul

<P>A FRENCH lady, who, by her conduct towards her hu&s;band, had driven him to &s;eek enjoyment abroad, makes the follow|ing curious declaration. "Yes, unhappy I am; I know all my follies, all my cap|rices; I have pa&s;&s;ed fourteen years, with|out reflecting one moment on the advan|tages, which might have re&s;ulted from mak|ing a friend of my hu&s;band.

with the&s;e he is de&s;tined to live in an in|timacy, which mu&s;t make him perpetually mi&s;erable.

certain we can endure the utmo&s;t rancor and malice of others, better than the lea&s;t coldne&s;s and indifference from tho&s;e, whom we have made it our con&s;tant en|deavor to plea&s;e."</P>
<P>WHATEVER comes from our neare&s;t friends, as an expre&s;&s;ion of love, we re|ceive as a &s;ub&s;tantial obligation; and feel the mo&s;t delicate touches of plea&s;ure from the &s;miles of friend&s;hip: but neglect and unkindne&s;s, from neare&s;t friends, bla&s;t ev|ery joy, and give the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible pain. To be always &s;ure of that frank and cheer|ful reception at home, of which Mr. Bloom&s;grove never failed; to be united with tho&s;e, to whom we may di&s;charge the fulne&s;s of the &s;oul, unburden our cares, and &s;hare our joys, mu&s;t be an unfailing &s;ource of dome&s;tic peace and plea&s;ure: for &s;or|row, like a &s;tream, grows weaker by being divided; and joy, like light, increa&s;es and brightens by being communicated.</P>

<P>IN a family, where the heads acted in concert, as if informed by one &s;oul; a|dopting each other's cares, uniting their friendly beams, and jointly promoting the common happine&s;s; the education of children was comparatively light and ea&s;y. Such was the advantage enjoyed in the Bloom&s;grove family. No &s;ooner was the important tru&s;t of children committed to

They found it was in vain to read the &s;y&s;tems of education then extant: little el&s;e could be collected from them, than general prin|ciples for pre&s;erving health, and teaching them letters, and figures. They were &s;uited to a di&s;tant meridian; and had ref|erence, either to the management of the children of nobility, or to the public edu|cation of young gentlemen de&s;tined to one or other of the learned profe&s;&s;ions.

Avoiding, there|fore, the track marked out in any &s;y&s;tem, they had recour&s;e to the intimations of nature; to the &s;tate of &s;ociety, govern|ment, and manners in their own country. They con&s;idered education as an appren|tice&s;hip for the employments of life; and that to be qualified for tho&s;e employments, was an object of the highe&s;t importance: that, to prepare them to di&s;charge the offices of good hu&s;bands and wives; good parents; dutiful children; affectionate relations and friends; u&s;eful members of communities; and benevolent citizens of the world; was the province, and the in|di&s;pen&s;able duty of parents. The prin|ciples of the&s;e duties are &s;imilar in all men; and the mea&s;ures to be taken with all children, to render them moral agents, are &s;imilar.

<P>AS parents are to be the models, upon which children are to form their temper and manners, &s;o they &s;hould under&s;tand what they would have their children ac|quainted with; and be them&s;elves what they wi&s;h their children to be.

They were careful to ac|quire
<PB N="56" REF="022570_0055_0FB99B61A1AE3140">
an entire authority over their child|ren, which they continued to exerci&s;e without &s;everity, or having recour&s;e to any violence. The propriety of this &s;tep will appear, if we con&s;ider that rea&s;on, in children, is feeble even after i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">egins to exert it&s;elf, and that parental authority is the &s;ub&s;titute which nature has provided for the period of impre&s;&s;ions:&mdash;"and, as no work of God is left imperfect, children are directed by in&s;tinct to obey their pa|rents; and if they be not unkindly treat|ed, their obedience is not only voluntary, but affectionate. This is not a picture of imagination: every one who has given attention to the infant &s;tate, will bear wit|ne&s;s, that a child clings to its mother, and is fonder of her than of all the world be|&s;ides. By this admirable plan, children who have but little rea&s;on, are commonly better governed, than adult per&s;ons who po&s;&s;e&s;s a con&s;iderable &s;hare of it; the former are entirely ob&s;equious to the rea|&s;on of another; the latter, not always to their own."

It is an ex|cellent preparative for &s;ocial life; and for that &s;elf command, which we have occa|&s;ion frequently to exerci&s;e through every part of life.</P>
<P>THERE is a fal&s;e tenderne&s;s, which pre|vents many parents from exerci&s;ing that authority over their children which their humors require, le&s;t it &s;hould give them pain: but they con&s;ider not that they are &s;acrificing the happine&s;s of their offspring, in the future part of life, to &s;ave them&s;elves a few moments pre&s;ent pain. But &s;uch parents do not obtain the end they aim at: for the humors and caprices of children increa&s;e by indulgence: and, being tol|erated in children, they become their own tormentors, and deprive their parents of that quiet and peace which they did not choo&s;e to have di&s;turbed by &s;ea&s;onably correcting their childi&s;h error.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="022570_0057_0FB99B65B9213E80">IT was the happy lot of the&s;e children to be under the direction of wi&s;e and vir|tuous parents, who corrected their errors by removing their cau&s;es: and by ob&s;erv|ing and adju&s;ting their little deviations in &s;ea&s;on, put it into their power to enjoy a much greater degree of happine&s;s than others; "while the e&s;&s;ential principles of future excellence were taking root in their minds." Sen&s;ible of all the&s;e advantages, they failed not to allure their children to obedience, by all tho&s;e endearing methods which render it as agreeable as it is u&s;eful.</P>
<P>THIS foundation being well laid, no ef|fort was wanting to erect the &s;uper&s;truc|ture. They were careful to remove all bad examples from their &s;ight: and con|&s;equently, were cautious whom they ad|mitted into their family. The a&s;&s;iduity of parents, to educate their children, will be lo&s;t without an attention to this cir|cum&s;tance: the advice and example of a &s;ubtle and vicious &s;ervant will do more towards deluding children to devious cour&s;es, than all the coun&s;el and re|mon&s;trance

of parents can do to the contrary.</P>
<P>THESE ob&s;tructions to dome&s;tic educa|tion being out of the way; and the parent|al authority e&s;tabli&s;hed, they taught their children a right deportment to them|&s;elves; to each other; and to all other members of the family; and exerci&s;ed them in the practical branches of the du|ties they taught. They were habituated, from infancy, to ob&s;erve the &s;abbath as a day devoted to God, and &s;erious purpo&s;es; and to attend public wor&s;hip, as the be&s;t &s;chool of good manners, as well as the nur&s;ery of religious principles. They were not only taught the principles of benevolence and charity to men; of ten|derne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion to in&s;ects and an|imals, but trained to practi&s;e upon tho&s;e principles. Their curio&s;ity was directed to proper objects, and generally gratified. As they advanced in years, their parents endeavored to lead their minds up to God; to view him as a being who had no beginning, and will have no end; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed

<P>AS &s;oon as they were capable of di&s;tin|gui&s;hing between virtue and vice, the lat|ter was pre&s;ented to the mind in all its odious colors; the former, in the mo&s;t plea&s;ing light. Truth and integrity, be|ing e&s;&s;ential to every good character, and the foundation of every other virtue, they were careful to repre&s;ent fraud, fal&s;ehood, and deceit in all their deformities: and they had the plea&s;ure of noticing an in|&s;tance of frankne&s;s in O&s;ander, at the age of twelve, which did him honor; while it afforded his parents the mo&s;t heartfelt &s;at|isfaction. At a neighbor's, on a vi&s;it with his mamma and &s;i&s;ter, he happened to re|main in the hou&s;e while the company were walking in the garden: being alone, he began to play with a tennis ball which he had in his pocket: it accidentally fell

upon a pile of china cups, and, by over|&s;etting them, broke a number: but, as he was alone in the room, and had not been mi&s;&s;ed by the company, he was not in danger of being &s;u&s;pected; but his gen|erous &s;oul di&s;dained to have others &s;uffer for his faults: he frankly informed his mamma of the accident, and de&s;ired her to inform Mrs. &mdash;, the lady of the hou&s;e, le&s;t &s;ome per&s;on &s;hould be wrong|fully accu&s;ed.

<P>IN the progre&s;s of the&s;e memoirs, we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to &s;peak of &s;everal in|&s;tances of frankne&s;s and genero&s;ity in Ro|zella: at pre&s;ent I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that &s;he had great &s;en&s;ibility; was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a mild temper, and, for a child, had a good under&s;tanding: a little pertne&s;s, however, appeared &s;ometimes.

<P>A CHILD po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this temper to a high degree, will make it&s;elf amends for a temporary re&s;traint and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, in the pre&s;ence of the parent, by being perver&s;e to &s;ervants and impertinent to playmates, when out of &s;ight.

<P>MRS. Bloom&s;grove early gave a check to the pa&s;&s;ion for dre&s;s which appears in fe|males, by repre&s;enting to her the folly of a gaudy dre&s;s, and the greater neatne&s;s of a plain mode&s;t apparel. The female mind is often rendered vain by a profu&s;ion of external ornaments in childhood. An|other in&s;tance of the prudent management of Mr. and Mrs. Bloom&s;grove, was, their patiently waiting the progre&s;s of nature, to mature their children for the &s;tage of ac|tion. Parents who have been ambitious of pu&s;hing their children forward &s;ooner than nature had prepared the way, have had rea&s;on to regret their folly: children, brought forward to public view before the judgment has had opportunity to form,

<P>AS every part of the human character is formed by habit, and habit by practical exerci&s;es, they wi&s;ely determined to ac|cu&s;tom their children to diligence and in|du&s;try; with &s;uch intervals of amu&s;ement, as were nece&s;&s;ary for health, cheerfulne&s;s, and vigor. Their amu&s;ements, too, were &s;o contrived, as to &s;ix habits of indu&s;try and promote the knowledge of bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;uited to their re&s;pective &s;ex: our young ma&s;ter is furni&s;hed with a little &s;pade and other tools &s;uited to his age, that he may cultivate a &s;pot in the garden for him&s;elf; in dre&s;&s;ing this he vies with the gardener. While he is thus amu&s;ing him&s;elf, he is acquiring habits of indu&s;try and &s;ome knowledge of agriculture.</P>
<P>ROZELLA, be&s;ides making and dre&s;&s;ing her doll, and other female amu&s;ements, was furni&s;hed with a little bed in the gar|den; this &s;he dre&s;&s;ed with her own hand,

This amu&s;ement combined exerci&s;e and indu&s;|try, while it contributed to health, which bloomed in her prominent cheeks.</P>
<P>ALL amu&s;ements, kept within proper bounds, contribute to promote the de&s;ign of education; for &s;uch is the connexion between bodily organs and intellectual operations, that the vigor of the latter de|pends on the tone of the former.

<P>ALREADY has it been ob&s;erved, and &s;ure I am you will not conte&s;t the truth of it, that fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions are deep|e&s;t and mo&s;t durable; and that the hap|pine&s;s of human life, depends much on the manner of our entering on the great theatre of the world. It is equally true, that the pro&s;perity of the dome&s;tic &s;tate is determined by the manner of its com|mencement: a full conviction of our en|tire dependence on the providence of God; a determination to di&s;charge all the relative duties of life, as a dictate of na|ture and a duty of moral obligation, are qualities requi&s;ite to the &s;ecurity of do|me&s;tic enjoyment.</P>
<P>THOSE who have neither tried this ex|pedient, nor attended to the connexion between the natural and moral world; nor to the influence of piety on outward pro&s;|perity, and e&s;pecially on our dome&s;tic con|dition, may laugh at the idea. But do not tho&s;e very per&s;ons wi&s;h to &s;eek their

&s;afety under the banner of religion, as the only &s;anctuary in times of trouble; as the only &s;ource of comfort under the di&s;ap|pointments of life? Impious men can look up to no protector in the time of trouble, while good men commit them&s;elves, with tru&s;t and hope, to the care of heaven. "The human mind, naturally feeble, is made to feel all its own weakne&s;s by the mea&s;ure of adver&s;ity. Dejected with evils which overpower its &s;trength, it relies no longer on it&s;elf. It ca&s;ts every where around a wi&s;hing, exploring eye, for &s;ome &s;helter to &s;creen, &s;ome power to uphold it; and if, when abandoned by the world, it can find nothing to which it can fly in the room of the world, its &s;tate is truly forlorn. Now whither &s;hould the vicious, in this &s;ituation, turn for aid? After having con|tended with the &s;treams of adver&s;e fortune till their &s;pirits are exhau&s;ted, gladly would they retreat at la&s;t to the &s;anctuary of re|ligion."</P>
<P>THIS provides a &s;ource of comfort for the mind in the gloomy &s;hades of &s;olitude,
<PB N="68" REF="022570_0067_0FB99B9009C4F618">
or the painful hour of adver&s;ity; the di&s;|tre&s;s of &s;ickne&s;s, or the infirmities of age. In tho&s;e periods and conditions, when de|jection and horror oppre&s;s and affright the vicious, the man of piety enjoys compo|&s;ure of mind: he has within him&s;elf a re|&s;ource, which, though it may be interrupt|ed, can never fail him; and, indeed, it is often the ca&s;e, that as the world lowers and darkens before him, the light that is within him grows brighter; his hopes re|new their &s;trength; his de&s;ires ri&s;e to nobler objects; his religion tran&s;ports him into regions new and boundle&s;s, where the mo&s;t enchanting pro&s;pects open to view; and the &s;urrounding objects are &s;uited to alleviate the burdens of life, to &s;catter its gloom, and in&s;pire the heart with joy in|effable.</P>
<P>THE early habits of piety had produced the happie&s;t effects upon the temper and di&s;po&s;ition of Mr. Bloom&s;grove, and his amiable con&s;ort, and qualified them in the be&s;t manner for the part they had to act in dome&s;tic life. The&s;e habits re&s;train
<PB N="69" REF="022570_0068_0FB99B91352B2138">
tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which are the principal oc|ca&s;ion of di&s;cord, and meliorate the tem|per, while they elevate the mind above low attachment and &s;ordid gratifications. Piety unites in one point of view, the &s;miling a&s;pect, both of the powers above and the objects below. It reflects a &s;un|&s;hine from heaven upon the pro&s;perity of the world. Where the heads of families are thus holden together by the ties of re|ligion, the gentle influence of it will be felt through every branch of the family. The voice of peace, the &s;imple &s;ong of cheerfulne&s;s and content, will be heard in that dwelling.</P>
<P>OF &s;o much con&s;equence it is, that we lay the foundation of dome&s;tic pro&s;perity and happine&s;s, deep and firm. I have therefore dwelt the longer upon this, which was a di&s;tingui&s;hing part of the character of tho&s;e who&s;e dome&s;tic me|moirs I am giving.</P>

<P>THE following &s;tory of an amiable youth, who, on embarking upon the the|atre of life, committed him&s;elf to the care, guidance, and protection of divine provi|dence, I think worthy a place in the&s;e memoirs.</P>
<P>THE fact (for it is not a fiction) is re|corded on the faithful pages of ancient authentic hi&s;tory. He was encouraged by a dream, which &s;eemed to portend great future pro&s;perity to him&s;elf, and the family he was about to form. It had &s;uch an effect on his mind, that he im|mediately re&s;olved never to for&s;ake that being who had appeared, at &s;o early a pe|riod, to favor his dome&s;ticating views;&mdash; for you will ob&s;erve, he was going in que&s;t of a wi&s;e;&mdash;but, that he would ac|knowledge him in all his ways. Apro|pos&mdash;our worthy friend &mdash; has found a companion nearer home. I cannot for|bear to mention it in this place, as you will feel &s;o deeply intere&s;ted in the event.

<P>I AM no vi&s;ionary; nor do I believe in that my&s;tical divinity which finds a &s;piritual meaning for every remarkable incident. Yet I &s;ee no difficulty in ad|mitting, that an all pervading &s;pirit can
<PB N="72" REF="022570_0071_0FB99B9C73D9C9D8">
communicate his mind to men, by means, of which we can have no conception. I cannot conceive any difficulty in the Fa|ther of our &s;pirits having acce&s;s to our mind in &s;uch a manner, as, by a vi&s;ion or dream, to &s;tamp upon it things nece&s;&s;ary for our information or encouragement; and that too by &s;uch images, as cannot fail to expre&s;s their meaning. Of this kind is the ju&s;tly celebrated dream to which I alluded, and which makes a di&s;|tingui&s;hed figure in the mo&s;t ancient writings.</P>
<P>I RELATE it with the more plea&s;ure in this place, becau&s;e tho&s;e writings were the delightful &s;tudy of Mr. Bloom&s;grove; and he &s;eems to have copied his maxims from the &s;entiments which the dream in|&s;pired.</P>
<P>IN the ages of &s;implicity, when rural occupations, and dome&s;tic cares and plea&s;|ures, divided the time and attention of mankind; a pious youth, as ancient &s;tory tells, undertook, in obedience to a parent's command, a long journey to &s;eek a dam|&s;el
<PB N="73" REF="022570_0072_0FB99B9DF66BDE98">
worthy his e&s;pou&s;al. The cu&s;tom of his father's hou&s;e required, that all mar|riage alliances &s;hould be formed with &s;ome collateral branch of his family. The venerable father, fearing le&s;t &s;o promi&s;ing a youth &s;hould be tempted to form a di&s;|honorable alliance with the tawny daugh|ters of the land, where they then dwelt; ha&s;tens his &s;on away to &s;eek a wife among the daughters of his kindred. The piety of the rather interpo&s;es its influence, to prevent him from a marriage, where it might have a dangerous tendency on his morals.</P>
<P>THE journey is long and tedious, through a dreary wilderne&s;s, where are no accom|modations to refre&s;h the weary traveller, except tho&s;e which provident nature fur|ni&s;hes. But a young man, pur&s;uing the dictates of duty, is always the object of divine patronage; he is never alone. The ever pre&s;ent &s;pirit of wi&s;dom and love is with him, in the hurry of travel|ling; in the &s;ilence and &s;lumbers of the night; in the noi&s;e of the town, or the
<PB N="74" REF="022570_0073_0FB99B9F7082B768">
&s;olitude of the de&s;ert. This ever pre&s;ent and indulgent &s;pirit accompanied our young adventurer, in his long and lonely journey. It fell out on a day as he trav|elled, that he reached a little village, where he determined to lodge, it being about &s;un&s;et. Whether there was no public inn for the accommodation of travellers, or whether from prudential motives, and ac|cording to the &s;implicity of the age, he cho&s;e it, does not appear: but, by the &s;e|quel, it &s;eems he lodged in the field; where he took a &s;tone for his pillow and laid him&s;elf down to &s;leep. But his im|agination is awake. While &s;oft &s;lumbers &s;ooth all his cares, and hovering angels guard his bed, his active mind is impre&s;&s;|ed with the figure of a ladder, of &s;uch a|mazing length, that while one end re&s;ted on the earth, the other reached the very heavens and lo&s;t it&s;elf among the clouds.</P>
<P>ON this vi&s;ionary ladder, tho&s;e benevo|lent agents who are &s;uppo&s;ed to be always attendant on good men, &s;eemed to be con|&s;tantly a&s;cending and de&s;cending: this
<PB N="75" REF="022570_0074_0FB99BA79A9442A0">
indicated that a con&s;tant intercour&s;e was pre&s;erved between heaven and earth; and &s;hewed him the favorable influence of piety, in procuring the ble&s;&s;ing of heaven upon him, in his individual and dome&s;tic &s;tate; for he particularly ob&s;erved that the Lord &s;tood above it. From this ele|vated &s;tation, the great Parent of all is rep|re&s;ented as addre&s;&s;ing the amiable youth, in language of paternal affection, a&s;&s;uring him of his favor and protection; that his pre&s;ent enterpri&s;e &s;hould be &s;ucce&s;sful; and pro&s;perity crown his future days.</P>
<P>SO clear was the vi&s;ion, &s;o audible the voice, that he awoke from &s;leep in a plea&s;|ing a&s;toni&s;hment. And, pouring out the grateful and pious effu&s;ions of his &s;oul, he made a &s;olemn vow of fidelity to him, who had appeared to patronize him in his pur|&s;uit; that he would &s;et up his BETHEL, daily pour incen&s;e on his dome&s;tic altar; and never cea&s;e to call on the name of the Lord:&mdash;nor were the&s;e tran&s;actions the illu&s;ions of fancy. In the future part of life, the whole was realized, and he lived

to be&s;tow his benedictions on his child|ren's children. So much does the hap|pine&s;s of life depend on the manner in which we fir&s;t &s;et out; the connexions we form, and the habits we contract. If we a&s;&s;ociate our&s;elves with the virtuous, and e&s;pecially in the great article of marriage; if we acquire habits of &s;obriety and good|ne&s;s, we may hope that gentle gales of pro&s;perity will waft us over life's vary|ing &s;urface, and &s;afely land us on its ut|mo&s;t verge: or &s;hould not our days be crowned with outward pro&s;perity, we have &s;till the means of dome&s;tic tranquil|lity, and a re&s;ource within our&s;elves which never fails.</P>

<P>FROM the &s;hort account already given of Mrs. Bloom&s;grove, you will ea&s;|ily believe, that in every part of life, &s;he was able to di&s;charge the duties of it with propriety. It would detract from the &s;uperior beauties of her mind, to &s;ay any
<PB N="77" REF="022570_0076_0FB99BAEEBAA0E08">
thing of the elegance of her per&s;on. She is now a wife, with all the charms of the conjugal relation; a mother, with all the tenderne&s;s of maternal affection. The dignity of her deportment in&s;pired all a|bout her with re&s;pect: the mildne&s;s of her temper &s;ecured her the mo&s;t cordial affec|tion of all her acquaintance. In Mrs. Bloom&s;grove, mode&s;ty happily united with under&s;tanding; dignity, with humil|ity; and cheerfulne&s;s, with religion.</P>
<P>SHE was well qualified to carry into ef|fect, the de&s;ign &s;he early formed, of giving &s;u&s;tenance, as well as in&s;truction, to her tender offspring. This was a re&s;|olution propitious to the education of her children; for the foundation of it is laid at the brea&s;t: there, the future temper and di&s;po&s;ition commences: and this, by reaction, has its influence in producing health, beauty, and cheerfulne&s;s; and greatly facilitates the cultivation of moral qualities.</P>
<P>OF all the animals, of which we have any knowledge, man enters into life in the
<PB N="78" REF="022570_0077_0FB99BB21494B128">
mo&s;t helple&s;s condition; and is, for a longer term than any, dependent on the care of others. But the God of nature, who always provides means for the &s;up|port of the mo&s;t helple&s;s creatures, has, by an admirable contrivance, implanted, in the brea&s;t of parents, an in&s;tinctive prin|ciple, which prompts them to the care and pre&s;ervation of their feeble offspring. This principle is connatural to the pa|rent. It is not the effect of rea&s;oning; nor can it ea&s;ily be eradicated from the human heart.</P>
<P>SOFT and gentle, it operates, in the mother, in a manner perfectly &s;uited to that kind of duty which the fir&s;t &s;tage of life requires. In the father, it prevails in a way &s;uited to the &s;ucceeding &s;tages of childhood and youth. It pu&s;hes him to great exertions in providing for the &s;up|port of his children, and in training them up for u&s;efulne&s;s in life. By this in&s;tinct, providence has founded in nature, a &s;uf|ficient balance again&s;t the fatigues and anxieties of nurturing their young.
<PB N="79" REF="022570_0078_0FB99BBA6F9B12A0">
The &s;oft and tender pa&s;&s;ions of the moth|er; the &s;trong and robu&s;t affections of the father, wonderfully prepare them for the important ta&s;k which nature has devolved upon them.</P>
<P>THAT education commences with our being, and that the nur&s;e is our fir&s;t pre|ceptre&s;s, were maxims upon which Mrs. Bloom&s;grove uniformly practi&s;ed: and they are as indubitably true, as they are important. What prudent mother then will tru&s;t the commencement of the edu|cation of her child in the hands of a mer|cenary nur&s;e; and &s;uffer one, who knows little more than how to yield nouri&s;hment to an infant, to be the fir&s;t preceptre&s;s of her &s;on? If we trace education up to its &s;ource, we &s;hall find that the quality of food fixes the &s;tate of the con&s;titution; that the temper is affected by the &s;ame cau&s;e, and by the &s;ituation in which the infant is fir&s;t placed; that the objects with which the eyes of an infant are mo&s;t con|ver&s;ant, have their influence al&s;o on the body and mind. The&s;e will have a la&s;t|ing

effect on the mu&s;cles of the face; and therefore, go into the determination of its beauty; on the cheerfulne&s;s of the mind, and goodne&s;s of the di&s;po&s;ition; and con|&s;equently, have their &s;hare in fixing the after propen&s;ities to virtue and vice.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame rea&s;on which Lord Kaimes a&s;&s;igns, that a female &s;hould bani&s;h all di&s;|mal thoughts, and pre&s;erve her&s;elf as calm and cheerful as po&s;&s;ible, during her pro|gre&s;&s;ive &s;tate, holds equally good in the nur&s;ing period, viz. Agreeable impre&s;&s;|ions may be made on an infant mind: and, if agreeable, by con&s;equence, di&s;a|greeable ones may be made al&s;o. It is then by no means a matter of indifference, what kind of objects, or countenances, are pre&s;ented to children; or what manage|ment they receive; for the impre&s;&s;ions, the habit will be la&s;ting.</P>
<P>I WAS a firm believer in the doctrine of &s;ympathies, and antipathies, till Doctor Moore wrote &s;o learnedly again&s;t it: nor am I an infidel yet. He has convinced me that ingenious rea&s;onings may be employed
<PB N="81" REF="022570_0080_0FB99BC2B8F3B258">
again&s;t it, but not of its fal&s;ity. Facts are &s;tubborn things. I knew a child, maim|ed exactly in imitation of a &s;ervant, who was frequently before the eyes of its mother, during the time of her advance|ment; even his bones were di&s;torted and out of place. This, and numberle&s;s other in&s;tances of a like nature, I think, prove the truth of the doctrine, be the cau&s;e of the&s;e phenomena what they may. The little O&s;ander and Rozella, enjoyed what|ever advantages aro&s;e from an agreeable a&s;&s;emblage of objects; and came forward into life, with the ble&s;&s;ings of health, ge|nius, and good temper: circum&s;tances, which contributed not a little to their en|joyment and u&s;efulne&s;s in the world.</P>
<P>IN America there are comparatively few mothers &s;o unnatural, as, of choice, to put their children out to nur&s;e. Some, indeed, there are, who do this from a love of ea&s;e, or a fancied &s;uperiority to the drudgery of giving &s;u&s;tenance to their helple&s;s offspring, to whom they have giv|en exi&s;tence. It &s;hould be con&s;idered,
<PB N="82" REF="022570_0081_0FB99BC432CC8058">
that the obligations between parent and child, are reciprocal; and if neglected by the former, it can hardly be expected that they will be fulfilled by the latter. It was well ob&s;erved by Rou&s;&s;eau, that the child &s;hould love its mother before it is &s;en&s;ible of it as a duty. If the voice of nature is not &s;trengthened by habit and cultivation, it will be &s;ilenced in its infan|cy, and the heart will peri&s;h, if I may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf, before it is born.</P>

<P>THE &s;entiments, contained in my la&s;t, were familiar to Mrs. Bloom&s;grove. She had too much goodne&s;s of heart, to omit any circum&s;tance of duty. Impell|ed by motives of duty and maternal affec|tion, &s;he &s;acrificed every per&s;onal con&s;id|eration to the care of her helple&s;s charge. Retired from the gay world, and all the plea&s;ures it offers, &s;he &s;tudied her own health with more attention than common, that &s;he might communicate to it the be&s;t
<PB N="83" REF="022570_0082_0FB99BC94DB402C8">
means of &s;upport and health. In the mid&s;t of her family and friends, &s;he is &s;een with her playful infant, &s;miling in her arms. Beautiful and intere&s;ting was the &s;ight, to behold her thus fulfilling the fir&s;t duties of nature. For what &s;he now does for her child, who does not &s;o much as know her, proves what &s;he will be capable of doing one day for him, when &s;he en|joys the happine&s;s of being beloved by him, and when &s;he has a&s;&s;ured to her&s;elf more right to his tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t &s;even years of life are a period, of much greater importance, in the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of education, than is generally imag|ined. Within this period are laid, the foundation of health; the temperament of the body, on which depend the pa&s;&s;ions and affections of the heart. On this foundation is to ri&s;e the fabric of virtue and excellence. So great a part of the management of children, through this &s;tage of it, falls to the lot of mothers, that, during its continuance, I &s;hall have but little occa&s;ion to &s;peak of Mr. Bloom&s;|grove.
<PB N="84" REF="022570_0083_0FB99BCC9EA63100">
Happy in the entire confidence of her hu&s;band, and enjoying all his aid and influence, &s;he took charge of the in|fant days of the children; and being a lady of great judgment, &s;he adopted a &s;y&s;|tem of her own, and pur&s;ued it with per|&s;evering &s;teadine&s;s.</P>
<P>OSANDER was born the twenty fourth day of September following their mar|riage; and Rozella, about two years after him. The difference in their ages was &s;o little, that the &s;ame manner of treatment, allowing for difference of &s;ex, &s;oon an|&s;wered for both.</P>

<P>N. B. THE want of method in training up children, may be a&s;&s;igned as a princi|pal rea&s;on of the well meant endeavors of &s;o many proving abortive. Parents are often governed more by their feelings than their judgment. The exerci&s;e of &s;uch capricious government &s;oon falls into contempt: in&s;truction is thrown away, becau&s;e counteracted by example; and

Rea&s;on has little or no &s;hare in the direction of our actions, till we have pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal years under the government of in|&s;tinct.</P>
<P>THIS was the term, in which Mrs. Bloom&s;grove attended to the formation of her children's con&s;titution, and to give a right direction to all the in&s;tinctive pow|ers and principles of nature. Mrs. G&mdash;, you know, was forever humoring and fondling her children; by which means their con&s;titutions are ruined. Pale and wan, they appear but half animated; and are doomed to drag out a life of weakne&s;s and di&s;ea&s;e, without genius, vivacity, or powers of &s;elf enjoyment. But Mrs. Bloom&s;grove, &s;en&s;ible that "a &s;ound mind, in a &s;ound body," was a ble&s;&s;ing in the fir&s;t rank of life; and that the&s;e are connected together, fir&s;t turned her attention to their health. Cleanline&s;s, air, and exerci&s;e, &s;he con&s;idered as the &s;tamina of health, and therefore let them play in the open air. She was le&s;s fearful of cold than heat, and had them temperately clad both

&s;ummer and winter: by varying their dre&s;s but little, with the &s;ea&s;ons, &s;he pre|&s;erved a regular temperament of the body. This idea &s;he probably received from Mr. Locke, who tells of per&s;ons in England, who wear the &s;ame clothes &s;ummer and winter, without any inconvenience, or more &s;en&s;e of cold than others. I am ac|quainted with tho&s;e in America who prac|ti&s;e the &s;ame; and never put on a loo&s;e coat but in foul weather, who appear to &s;uffer le&s;s from the cold, than tho&s;e who are loaded with garments.</P>
<P>THIS depends on u&s;e: our faces are naturally as &s;u&s;ceptible of cold, or heat, as any part of the body; it is only by habit, that they harden, and become capable of enduring either.</P>
<P>THE Scythian philo&s;opher gave a proper account of this matter, in his an|&s;wer to the Athenian, who inquired how he could go naked in fro&s;t and &s;now? How, &s;aid the Scythian, can you endure your face expo&s;ed to the &s;harp air? "My face is u&s;ed to it," &s;aid the Athe|nian.
<PB N="88" REF="022570_0087_0FB99BD9F0D63280">
"Think me all face," replied the Scythian.</P>
<P>MR. Locke recommends that children &s;hould lie without a cap at night, as &s;oon they are able to run about without one by day; and a&s;&s;igns this rea&s;on for it. "Nothing more expo&s;es to headachs, colds, catarrhs, coughs, and &s;everal other di&s;ea&s;es, than keeping the head warm." For the &s;ame rea&s;on, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e the child ought never to have a cap on its head. By expo&s;ing it to the air, it gathers &s;trength; the &s;olids become more ten&s;e, and act more vigorou&s;ly, in propelling the circulating fluids. All the parts being more active, they repel many dangers to which they would otherwi&s;e be expo&s;ed; the bu&s;ine&s;s of thinking, reflecting, and rea&s;oning, will be carried on with greater activity and vigor.</P>
<P>CERTAIN it is, that health prevails more in cottages than in palaces; and, no doubt, the organs of the body are in bet|ter order for mental operations. To what cau&s;e can we a&s;cribe this, but to its being

<P>MRS. Bloom&s;grove, ob&s;erving that the children of a poor neighbor were &s;eldom troubled with colds and coughs, which often attended tho&s;e of a wealthy family in the &s;ame neighborhood; rea&s;oned thus with her&s;elf: "tho&s;e poor children acquire a hardine&s;s from the nece&s;&s;ity of having their feet frequently wet, being al|ways badly &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">od; while the others never fail to take cold when, by accident, they wet theirs.

<P>ON a day, when the declining &s;un had tinged the mountain tops with its milder rays, and reddening &s;kies invited the tuneful choir to &s;erenade the groves, with the faint lays of their evening &s;ong; the&s;e happy parents were invited, by the &s;erenity that followed the &s;hower, to the gravel walk. At the in&s;tant of their re|turn, a little affair happened in the ver|dant back yard, which, were it not for its con&s;equences, would not be worth relat|ing; but on account of tho&s;e, de&s;erves
<PB N="92" REF="022570_0091_0FB99BF083967500">
our notice. To this place the little brother and &s;i&s;ter had been allured, by the &s;ame cau&s;es which induced their pa|rents to walk; the &s;hower had &s;wollen the rivulet beyond its u&s;ual &s;ize; they wi&s;h to &s;ee it overflow its banks. Ac|cordingly, they &s;et about &s;topping its cour&s;e with &s;uch materials as they can collect. They ply with vigor, and &s;eem ju&s;t ready to accompli&s;h their de&s;ign, when, lo! an unfore&s;een accident damps the ri&s;ing joy; &s;o precarious are all our pro&s;pects, all our enjoyments!</P>
<P>THE little Rozella, now about three or four years old, is deep laden with materi|als; and, in attempting to depo&s;it them to the be&s;t advantage&mdash;O! dire to re|late&mdash;&s;he plunges headlong into the over|flowing current. The parents, who had ju&s;t returned, and were viewing the play|ful &s;cene, ran to her relief, not much a|larmed, indeed, from the depth of water. On this occa&s;ion Mrs. Bloom&s;grove &s;hew|ed a great degree of &s;elf command; a nec|e&s;&s;ary attainment for tho&s;e who have the
<PB N="93" REF="022570_0092_0FB99BF3D1B72418">
care of children! &s;he caught her little daughter in her arms, and plea&s;antly &s;aid, "The ducks paddle in the water, there|fore Rozella is a little duck." Rozella took hold of her frock, and held it out, crying&mdash;Her mamma looked at it, and, &s;miling, &s;aid, "What, my dear, did you like to have wet your new frock? come, let us go and dry it." The &s;urpri&s;e &s;ub|&s;ides: the child cea&s;es crying, and &s;oon begins to &s;mile. A frown, on this occa|&s;ion, would have broken her little heart, without the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible advantage. Mrs. Bloom&s;grove availed her&s;elf of the opportunity to wa&s;h them both, in the &s;ame water in which they had been at play; and found it &s;alutary, in abating an eruptive complaint which attended them. By repeating the &s;ame, &s;he &s;oon found the complaint entirely removed. Convinced of the utility of the practice, &s;he continued it, at &s;hort intervals; but frequently wa&s;hed their heads and feet in cold water, through all the &s;ea&s;ons. She was often heard to &s;ay, after her children
<PB N="94" REF="022570_0093_0FB99BF6F585F338">
were grown up, &s;he believed &s;carce any thing had contributed &s;o much to remove little complaints; to prevent great ones; and to con&s;olidate their con&s;titution, as this practice.</P>
<P>THE open air, where it can be enjoyed, undoubtedly, is far preferable to any hou&s;e for children to divert them&s;elves in; for, by degrees, they habituate them&s;elves to tho&s;e vici&s;&s;itudes of weather, to which they will be expo&s;ed all their days. Their bodies will be of little u&s;e to them, in this variable climate, if they cannot endure tho&s;e changes; nor can they enjoy life, unle&s;s prepared for them by early habits. The only objection Mrs. Bloom&s;grove has to open air, is the danger of tarni&s;hing her daughter's fair complexion. Again&s;t this &s;he guards as effectually as &s;he can; and the green plot &s;erves, in a great mea&s;|ure, as a preventive: and &s;he con&s;idered that health, and &s;prightline&s;s, which are no le&s;s ornamental to the &s;ex, than a fair complexion, and which are promoted by tho&s;e means, as a full compen&s;ation for the ri&s;k &s;he ran.</P>

<P>PLAINNESS and &s;implicity, in food and drink, were the maxims which governed Mrs. Bloom&s;grove in the man|agement of her children. Milk, and far|inaceous food, are mo&s;t &s;uitable for them. Cu&s;tom has a great effect; and the palate may be formed to almo&s;t any thing; but, it by no means follows, that the &s;tomach can &s;afely receive every thing to which the palate may be reconciled. It was the o|pinion of the great Mr. Locke, that mo&s;t of the di&s;ea&s;es in England were to be imputed
<PB N="96" REF="022570_0095_0FB99BF970E205D8">
to eating too much meat, and too little bread. He therefore advi&s;es to avoid giving children any meat till they are two, or three years old. He &s;uppo&s;es "they would breed their teeth with much le&s;s danger, be freer from di&s;ea&s;e, while they are little, and lay the foundation of an healthy and &s;trong con&s;titution much &s;ur|er, if they were not crammed &s;o much as they are, by fond mothers and fooli&s;h &s;er|vants, and were kept wholly from fle&s;h the fir&s;t three or four years of their lives!"</P>
<P>AS the palate may be formed to any thing, &s;o it was prudent in Mrs. Bloom&s;|grove, who received the entire approba|tion of her hu&s;band therein, to confine her children to a &s;imple, unoffending diet. Butter, oily &s;ub&s;tances, gro&s;s meats, or any heavy bodies, &s;uch as high &s;ea&s;onings con&s;i&s;t of, oppre&s;s the &s;tomach, heat and vitiate the blood, and bring on unnatural drought, langor, and drow&s;ine&s;s; and therefore, are improper for children. This unnatural drought will only be in|crea&s;ed by drinking; for it is certain that
<PB N="97" REF="022570_0096_0FB99C00971EBF38">
frequent drinking creates drought. This has led writers, on education, to caution parents again&s;t &s;uffering children to have recour&s;e, too frequently, to any kind of liquor. Drink is often given children to &s;ilence their crying; and whenever they &s;ee others drink, it excites an inclination to the &s;ame in them&s;elves; and, if grati|fied, will induce a dangerous habit. The abovementioned writer &s;ays, that he once lived in a hou&s;e where, to appea&s;e a frow|ard child, drink was given to it, as often as it cried; &s;o that it was con&s;tantly drink|ing; and though the child could not &s;peak, it drank more in twenty four hours than he did. A per&s;on may be guilty of intemperance in the u&s;e of cold water as well as of ardent &s;pirits.</P>

&s;hould not be di&s;tant, or formal, with children, who&s;e con&s;titutions dige&s;t rapid|ly. Food &s;hould be given, merely to &s;at|isfy hunger."</P>
<P>IN imitation of Augu&s;tus, who, when he was the greate&s;t monarch on earth, tells us he took a bit of dry bread in his chariot, O&s;ander ate little el&s;e than bread, milk, roots and vegetables, until near five years old. He was not confined to &s;et meals, but ate when he was hungry, and drank when he was dry; unle&s;s tho&s;e ap|petites appeared to be the effect of caprice, or were excited by &s;eeing others eat; for children are imitative beings. In that ca&s;e, he is tried with a piece of dry bread or fair water; if the appetite be not &s;trong enough for the&s;e, it is a fal&s;e one. By this &s;imple, temperate manner of living, he ac|quired all the &s;trength, &s;prightline&s;s, and agility, of the young Romans, who were fed in the &s;ame way, and were remarkable for &s;trength and activity.</P>
<P>NATURE is the be&s;t directre&s;s in tho&s;e ca&s;es; and it is &s;afe&s;t following her dic|tates.
<PB N="99" REF="022570_0098_0FB99C051DF8D230">
The habit of eating at a particular hour, when we ri&s;e into a family &s;tate, be|comes convenient: bu&s;ine&s;s, company, and the order of &s;ociety, render it unavoid|able; but it cannot be nece&s;&s;ary that child|ren &s;hould be compelled to eat then, or to &s;u&s;pend eating at other times. When the habit is contracted, the child will feel the cravings of appetite at the &s;tated periods; and will indulge merely from habit, or to gratify an imaginary want. The con&s;e|quences will be, a depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits, ill humor, and fretfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>ALTHO O&s;ander is permitted to &s;it at table at the age of five, yet he is not often helped to any meat, and &s;eldom wi&s;hes for any; much le&s;s does he ever a&s;k for this or that, as fancy may dictate; as is the manner of &s;ome children, who are made perfect epicures at ten years old. And as to Rozella, tho, like the Spar|tan mi&s;&s;es, &s;he is bred up to &s;ome degree of hardine&s;s, yet &s;he can &s;carce be prevail|ed upon to ta&s;te meat till &s;he is &s;ix or &s;even years old; but &s;he is as plump as a par|tridge, and fre&s;h as a ro&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="022570_0099_0FB9972920F85A78">IN the article of fruit, with which the garden abounded, they were indulged, with very little re&s;triction, except that the fruit be ripe.

The &s;ame ob&s;ervation holds good of all market towns, where children's coppers will procure fruit without the parents' knowledge.</P>
<P>TO prohibit their u&s;e of it, or even to attempt to re&s;train it, would only make them ravenous after that for which they would never hanker, if laid open to them at will. And, be&s;ides, the rotation of &s;ummer fruit is admirably &s;uited, to cor|rect the blood and juices, and afford a balance again&s;t the exce&s;&s;ive heat of that &s;ea&s;on. The vegetable acid &s;erves as a powerful anti&s;corbutic, while the rich pulp nouri&s;hes animal nature; and if children at any time overdo a little, they will find by experience the nece&s;&s;ity of more caution for the future.</P>

<P>MY Mercury is on the wing, and admits not my continuing the &s;ubject:&mdash; but, while he is adju&s;ting &s;ome little mat|ters, I &s;natch a moment to take a turn with you in the garden. Large and commo|dious, it contains every kind of delicious fruit, together with roots and vegetables for the u&s;e of the family; I may add, of many a poor family al&s;o in the neighbor|ing village, who &s;hare the bounty of its owner. This is a lively emblem of Mr. Bloom&s;grove! who always blends the u&s;eful and agreeable in a happy manner. In the mid&s;t of this garden, is a &s;pacious walk: trees and flowers, on either &s;ide, afford an a&s;&s;emblage of agreeable objects as we pa&s;s. At the yonder end, is an ar|bor which has an air of elegant &s;implicity, and affords a cool retreat from the heat of the &s;un. The woodbine, inter&s;per&s;ed a|mong its &s;a&s;hes, makes a beautiful appear|ance, and dazzles the eye with an infinity of reflections, which glitter among the

leaves. The &s;eats are &s;o entwined with &s;avin, as to have the appearance of a green &s;ofa. On either &s;ide is a fi&s;h pond, with a bathing font at the end, con&s;tantly &s;up|plied with fre&s;h water from beneath a di&s;|tant rock. As the principal walk runs in a vermicular direction, and all the others in a &s;imilar manner, they do not inter&s;ect each other at right angles; but in every direction are cut into &s;egments of circles. This is imitating nature: for &s;he no where, in any of her works, exhibits a right angle; and it affords a romantic ap|pearance. By this contrivance the foliage has much more benefit from the air, than if they were in direct lines. As you enter the gate, your eye follows the &s;low wind|ing cour&s;e, and &s;urveys, partly thro the trees, the bowery at the other end, which has a fine effect upon the imagina|tion.

We afterwards view them in a different manner, becau&s;e we have more under|&s;tanding of their properties; we become more able to inve&s;tigate the cau&s;es, and trace the effects of natural objects; for children acquire their knowledge, by per|ception only; but men gain under&s;tand|ing by rea&s;oning, compari&s;on, and deduc|tion.

<P>THAT children &s;hould be taught to &s;ubmit to nece&s;&s;ity, that is, to bear any unavoidable pain, with patience, is not only right, but the mo&s;t u&s;eful le&s;&s;on in life.

The habit of doing this rendered them quite fearle&s;s of thunder, and the rea&s;ons &s;he u&s;ed to a&s;&s;ign to them, in order to excite their fortitude, had a happy effect in con|firming her own.</P>

No &s;tories of gho&s;ts and hobgoblins have ever yet reached their ears, nor ever will, if the vigilance of their parents can prevent the evil. Mrs. Bloom&s;grove once caught a young woman, who had lately come into the hou&s;e, telling &s;ome wonderful &s;tory to the children: &s;he concluded, by their at|tention, that it partook of the marvellous; and immediately called her to her own room, as if to do &s;omething, where &s;he lectured her upon the folly and danger of alarming the apprehen&s;ions of children with bugbear &s;tories; and a&s;&s;ured her, that if &s;he ever did the like again, &s;he mu&s;t immediately quit the hou&s;e. Great care is requi&s;ite to guard children again&s;t the follies of &s;ervants: they are generally fond of marvellous things, and children are plea&s;ed with the &s;ame, becau&s;e they have

<P>OSANDER and Rozella have no more fear from tho&s;e chimerical inhabitants of darkne&s;s, than we have from tho&s;e of the planet Her&s;chel: their ignorance is their protection again&s;t all &s;uch fairy beings. Having no knowledge of them, they go to bed in the dark, with le&s;s fear than mo&s;t oth|ers do with a candle; they &s;ay their pray|ers; repeat their evening hymns, and fall a&s;leep, with as little apprehen&s;ion of dan|ger, as if in their mother's arms.</P>
<P>NOTHING could have been more di|rectly in point&mdash;A friend, who, this mo|ment, has called on me, informs me of the death of an unfortunate youth about eighteen years of age. A more promi&s;ing child perhaps never ble&s;t a mother's arms, until twelve years old; when a &s;ervant,

<P>MRS. Bloom&s;grove guards her children again&s;t ra&s;hne&s;s, by &s;uffering them to ex|perience the inconvenience of it, when very young.

<P>CHILDREN brought up together, in the affectionate manner they were, have few differences; but the mo&s;t perfect educa|tion will not wholly prevent the&s;e. The
<PB N="114" REF="022570_0113_0FB997570E588BE0">
idea of property, and &s;en&s;e of per&s;onal rights, take place very early in the mind. Interferences of intere&s;t, or of pa&s;&s;ions, will produce contentions; and the&s;e, com|plaints: but &s;o prudent a mother will rarely indulge children, in coming to her with complaints one again&s;t the other. To allow of this, on every trifling occa|&s;ion, would be to encourage a complain|ing di&s;po&s;ition. To receive, and decide on, their controver&s;ies, unle&s;s &s;ome real injury is done, would have a tendency to excite enmity between them. She makes light of their complaints again&s;t each oth|er, telling them that &s;uch trifles are not worth minding; but privately admoni&s;h|es the aggre&s;&s;or. If Rozella catches up her brother's top and runs away with it, and complaint is made, or her mamma &s;ees the playful trick, &s;he is told to re&s;tore it and never to take any thing that does not belong to her&mdash;"How would you like to have O&s;ander get the pieces of china out of your baby hou&s;e, or the flowers from your knot in the garden? and be&s;ides, a

<P>EVERY action, that had the appearance of revenge, was treated with &s;uch marks of di&s;approbation, as to convince the child both of the impropriety and inconvenience of it. They were taught the mo&s;t plea&s;|ing kind of revenge, doing good to the injurious, &amp;c. by little &s;tories &s;uited to their capacities, and which illu&s;trated the &s;ubject in the be&s;t manner.

<P>IT happened one day, as Rozella was running in one of the cro&s;s walks in the garden, &s;he &s;tumbled over the handle of O&s;ander's hoe, which he had heedle&s;s|ly left in the way. She fell upon his bed,
<PB N="117" REF="022570_0116_0FB99764B1B017C0">
and broke down a favorite vine, which he had nouri&s;hed with more than ordinary care. He came into the garden ju&s;t as &s;he had ari&s;en, and &s;tood looking at the vine &s;he had unfortunately broken. O|&s;ander &s;eeing what &s;he had done, and not knowing by what means, in the fir&s;t &s;ally of pa&s;&s;ion, ran to her knot and pulled up by the roots the mo&s;t beautiful tulip &s;he had in all her flowery. Grievous com|plaints from both &s;ides go up to their mamma; for &s;he is the arbitre&s;s in all their childi&s;h di&s;putes. Both are plaint|iffs, both defendants. She hears them patiently, &s;peaks kindly to both; and di&s;|mi&s;&s;es them for the pre&s;ent, telling them to go wa&s;h their faces, for they had been crying, and to a&s;k Ca&s;pina, the maid, for a piece of bread.</P>
<P>TAKING them &s;eparately, &s;he inquired into the affair: as Rozella was the fir&s;t, in the &s;eeming tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, &s;he was &s;um|moned fir&s;t. It appeared, on examina|tion, to be an accident in which &s;he came very near lo&s;ing one of her eyes. She
<PB N="118" REF="022570_0117_0FB9976627E7A708">
&s;obs, and was very much troubled, to think &s;he had hurt her brother's vine, and offers to replace it with &s;ome of her &s;weet brier. She is dimi&s;&s;ed with a caution to be more careful in future, and a charge always to love her little brother. Sweet innocence &s;at on her little brow, and with a low courte&s;y &s;aid, "thank you, mamma," and went out.</P>
<P>OSANDER was then called: he appears guilty. Such is the different effect of actions voluntary, and tho&s;e which are unavoidable. Wa&s;hing in cold water had &s;tilled the tumult of his pa&s;&s;ions; eat|ing with his &s;i&s;ter had opened all the ave|nues to the heart: he felt the force of conviction, and owned the fault. He &s;aid he would never hurt his &s;i&s;ter's things any more; that he intended only to pull off the tulip, and the whole came up by the roots: but he would replace it with his double pink holyoke, and that when her cou&s;in Fanny came, they &s;hould both pick as many of his &s;trawberries as they plea&s;ed; and that the next time
<PB N="119" REF="022570_0118_0FB99769E24383D0">
his &s;i&s;ter fell down, he would run and help her up, in&s;tead of hurting her flow|er bed.</P>
<P>SELF CONVICTION is the be&s;t foun|dation for amendment. The action was revengeful, and de&s;erved pun|i&s;hment; and the prudent mother put him into a way to inflict it on him&s;elf. She gravely &s;aid, "My dear, I am glad you &s;ee your error. I only wi&s;h you had &s;een it before you committed it; becau&s;e revenge is the wor&s;t thing in the world: for the future, you mu&s;t think what you are going to do, before you do it; and never do wrong to others if they have done &s;o to you. But your &s;i&s;ter did not de&s;ign you an injury; and be&s;ides, &s;he had like to have lo&s;t one of her eyes in the fall." The mention of this quite over|came him. He bur&s;t into a flood of tears, &s;aying, "what would my poor little &s;i&s;ter have done, if &s;he had lo&s;t one of her eyes?" Every circum&s;tance helped to prepare the way for u&s;eful le&s;&s;ons, and generous actions. Rozella, being called
<PB N="120" REF="022570_0119_0FB9976C34FCB668">
in, her brother catches her round the neck, and, ki&s;&s;ing her, calls her his dear little &s;i&s;ter; is &s;orry he &s;poiled her beau|tiful tulip; laments the danger, &s;he had been in, of lo&s;ing one of her eyes; offers her any thing, every thing in his garden; and, above all, promi&s;es to be kind to her always. The little generous creature de|clined all his offers except the la&s;t; and &s;ays, "that is worth more than an hun|dred tulips, and &s;he does not de&s;ire any thing el&s;e."</P>

Perhaps a wife never appeared with more dignity or amiablene&s;s in the eyes of her hu&s;band, than &s;he did on this occa&s;ion. He highly applauded the mea&s;|ures &s;he had taken.

<PB N="122" REF="022570_0121_0FB99771F8078D38">
the act of eating together had in produc|ing harmony of affection. He dwelt largely on the va&s;t advantage of the pru|dent care and wi&s;e management of a mother to young children; and be&s;towed many encomiums upon her, and declared him&s;elf extremely happy in having a wife &s;o competent to the bu&s;ine&s;s of educating the objects of their mutual affections. Ye affectionate hu&s;bands, who are ble&s;t with wives who nur&s;e the infancy, and guard the childhood of your offspring, con&s;ider their painful ta&s;k, the variety and diffi|culty attending it; and never cea&s;e to al|leviate their condition by tenderne&s;s, and reward their goodne&s;s by applau&s;e!

The cool approbation of Mr. Bloom&s;grove, however, could not fail of affording her &s;en&s;ible plea&s;ure: this &s;he expre&s;&s;ed by a mode&s;t reply, becoming the delicacy of her &s;ex, and the affection of a wife to the be&s;t of hu&s;bands.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIV.</HEAD>
<P>IMITATION is a very powerful &s;pring of action in human nature, e&s;pec|ially in children. In females, it operates more &s;trongly than in our &s;ex: they are quick to di&s;cern the peculiarities of female conduct, and directly catch the manners of their own &s;ex. This pronene&s;s to im|itation, &s;trengthens in proportion as the manners and amu&s;ements of others come within our reach: &s;mall children will, therefore, be more likely to imitate tho&s;e older than them&s;elves, than grown peo|ple. Altho older children will de&s;cend to partake in the amu&s;ements of younger, rather than be left alone, yet this is con|trary to nature: &s;he always directs us to imitate tho&s;e above us. On this account, great advantage may be made of this imi|tative
<PB N="125" REF="022570_0124_0FB9977CA77F7B10">
propen&s;ity, in the progre&s;s of edu|cation.</P>
<P>I CANNOT go on to relate the circum|&s;tances, relative to the new comer into the family, before I mention &s;ome of the dangerous tendencies of this imitative propen&s;ity, and &s;ome of its u&s;es. Child|ren often catch a broken dialect from tho&s;e older than them&s;elves, of which it requires great pains to break them. It is ob&s;erved, that tho&s;e children who are brought up in the We&s;t Indies, &s;urround|ed with Negroes, have a kind of mongrel, Anglo-Africano dialect. The &s;ame ill effect is produced, by &s;peaking to them in a broken inarticulate language, or, what is called babytalk. This ought never to be permitted; but the mo&s;t plain, full, and di&s;tinct &s;ounds &s;hould be employed in &s;peaking to children. Another bad effect which may ari&s;e from this propen&s;ity, is, that boys and girls, being con&s;tantly to|gether in a family, will &s;lide into an imi|tation of each others manners; tho na|ture dictates different manners and amu&s;e|ments
<PB N="126" REF="022570_0125_0FB9977E122AE4E8">
to them. "A boy educated with girls of his own age, will imitate their manners and become effeminate; but it is more common to &s;ee a girl imitate the manners of the boys with whom &s;he is ed|ucated." The con&s;equences are more injurious in the latter ca&s;e than in the former; for the manners will react upon the mind, and have their influence in moulding that: but the effect of any im|proper &s;tamp, from this quarter, will be much more ea&s;ily effaced from boys than girls; they are more abroad, and conver|&s;ant with a greater variety of objects, which have a tendency to efface any un|favorable impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>IT was on account of this imitative pronene&s;s, and the advantages to be de|rived from it, that Mrs. Bloom&s;grove con|ceived a with to procure a female compan|ion for her little daughter, who&s;e educa|tion had been &s;uch as would afford a good model for imitation; and of &s;uch an age, as not to have lo&s;t all reli&s;h for amu&s;e|ments &s;uited to that of Rozella. This
<PB N="127" REF="022570_0126_0FB997806BDCFD18">
would be &s;ecuring to her all the plea&s;ures of company and amu&s;ement at home, and afford a con&s;tant &s;timulus to improvement, without the di&s;advantage of bad examples among other children. Nothing has a better tendency to elevate the mind, than to place tho&s;e images before it, which, tho above our reach at pre&s;ent, yet appear not too far di&s;tant to encourage our hope of &s;oon attaining the &s;ame excellence. This wi&s;h &s;he communicated to her hu&s;|band, who was &s;oon going to &mdash;, where lived a di&s;tant relation of Mrs. Bloom&s;|grove, who had four daughters and two &s;ons. She was the widow of a merchant of great integrity, who lived in the me|tropolis, where the widening river min|gles its waters with tho&s;e of the Atlantic ocean. His children had, therefore, en|joyed every advantage for the refinements of education; nor had they been neglect|ed, as is too often the ca&s;e, in the more &s;ub&s;tantial qualities. His circum&s;tances had been much reduced by lo&s;&s;es at &s;ea: and about this time the misfortunes of the
<PB N="128" REF="022570_0127_0FB9978ACA03F700">
family were completed. The dwelling hou&s;e in which he lived, took fire, and communicated the flame to an adjoining &s;tore: it being dry, and a high wind at &s;outhea&s;t, the fire raged to &s;uch a degree, as to baffle every effort to check its prog|re&s;s. In the &s;pace of an hour, he &s;aw his buildings, with mo&s;t of his effects, con&s;um|ed to a&s;hes. A circum&s;tance much more di&s;tre&s;sful to his family was, he overheat|ed him&s;elf by violent exertions to re&s;cue his property from the devouring flames, which threw him into a fever, of which he died in about ten days, amid&s;t the inex|pre&s;&s;ible grief and lamentations of a mo&s;t affectionate wife, and &s;ix children; the younge&s;t of whom, FANNY, was about thirteen. Circum&s;tanced as they now were, the propo&s;als from Mrs. Bloom&s;|grove were very agreeable. Fanny, was to be prepared for her departure as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and to be conveyed under the protection of her younge&s;t brother, a youth of about twenty, who was remark|able for his kindne&s;s and attention to his &s;i&s;ters.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="022570_0128_0FB9978C37CD1860">FANNY unites that delicacy, &s;en&s;ibility, and genero&s;ity of mind, to a fair form and graceful manners, which never fail to at|tract the notice and &s;ecure the e&s;teem of all her acquaintance. Being the younge&s;t of four &s;en&s;ible and amiable &s;i&s;ters, &s;he had derived great advantage from the in|formation they had acquired, and from the dignity of their manners. This lu&s;|tre, &s;he is now invited to reflect down up|on the little Rozella, as a kind of precep|tive companion. She was expected about this time, which had excited the &s;olicitude of O&s;ander and Rozella, to have their little gardens in the be&s;t order, at her ar|rival; and this, probably, was the cau&s;e or their great agitation, occa&s;ioned by the adventure in the garden. This palliates O&s;ander's criminality a little, for he had not di&s;covered any marks of a revengeful temper before, having never been taught it, in childhood, by having the floor beat|en, becau&s;e "IT HURT BABY."

<P>IT was not long after they had retired to re&s;t, when Fanny arrived, with her brother. The &s;ervant, who went to the door, at the loud rap, I mentioned before, ran, in an ec&s;tacy of joy, to tell his mi&s;tre&s;s of Mi&s;s Fanny's arrival; and would im|mediately have gone, and awoke Rozella, that &s;he might partake of the joy, but &s;he prevented him. There can &s;carcely be a &s;urer evidence of a good ma&s;ter and mi&s;|tre&s;s, than the plea&s;ure which a &s;ervant expre&s;&s;es at tho&s;e dome&s;tic occurrences, in which he can have no other intere&s;t, than the plea&s;ure which they receive.</P>
<P>FANNY met a mo&s;t cordial reception from her new patrons. They de&s;ired her to con&s;ider her&s;elf perfectly at home, and to look upon them as her papa and mam|ma; as &s;uch they a&s;&s;ured her they would act. The u&s;ual inquiries being made af|ter the health of the family, and having taken &s;ome refre&s;hment, &s;he was &s;hewn to her apartment, being much fatigued with
<PB N="131" REF="022570_0130_0FB99798F48C6C50">
her journey. In the morning, Ca&s;pina went, much earlier than u&s;ual, to awake Rozella, and communicate the joyful tid|ings of her cou&s;in's arrival. She was in raptures with the account; and having never yet &s;een her cou&s;in, could hardly wait till &s;he ro&s;e, without flying into her arms. But, being early accu&s;tomed to a re&s;traint on her pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to government, &s;he was compo&s;ed, without difficulty, to wait her cou&s;in's hour, tho a late one.</P>
<P>THEIR fir&s;t meeting was &s;uch, as might naturally be expected from children cir|cum&s;tanced as they were; nor was O&s;an|der an unconcerned &s;pectator of the de|lightful &s;cene; but entered deeply into the &s;pirit of it. He felt the more &s;en&s;ible plea&s;ure on the occa&s;ion, as he &s;hould &s;oon have an opportunity to &s;hew her his gar|den; and to lead her and his &s;i&s;ter to his &s;trawberry bank. Fanny is &s;oon made acquainted with the articles of furniture in Rozella's play hou&s;e, and the &s;everal kinds of flowers which adorn her garden.
<PB N="132" REF="022570_0131_0FB9979CC3BD7948">
As &s;oon as breakfa&s;t was over, O&s;ander invited them into the garden; &s;hewed his cou&s;in all the curio&s;ities; and led them to the bank where the &s;trawberries hung in clu&s;ters, and in all their perfection. He very prettily invited them both to come there and eat &s;trawberries, whenever it &s;hould be agreeable to them. The hour having arrived, he bade them good bye, &s;aying, "I mu&s;t go to &s;chool."</P>

<P>TO avoid confu&s;ion of objects and ideas, I propo&s;ed dividing the &s;ea&s;on of education into three periods, and a&s;&s;igning to each, tho&s;e exerci&s;es &s;uited to develop the native powers of the mind, and draw forth, under proper cultivation, the prin|ciples and affections of the heart. The fir&s;t period, thro which we have &s;een the&s;e
<PB N="133" REF="022570_0132_0FB9979D83DB7128">
children conducted, is naturally and prin|cipally the &s;ea&s;on of impre&s;&s;ions; but not wholly exclu&s;ive of &s;entiments, opinions, or principles. The faculty of comparing tho&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, and the de&s;ires they oc|ca&s;ion, are of early birth: tho not &s;trictly coeval with impre&s;&s;ions and &s;en&s;ibility, yet they clo&s;ely attend their &s;teps.</P>
<P>IT will, therefore, be impo&s;&s;ible to avoid recurring to the fir&s;t period for the com|mencement of the culture of many vir|tues, the practice of which more properly belongs to the &s;ub&s;equent periods. If we take a review of what has pa&s;&s;ed in the fir&s;t &s;tage, we &s;hall &s;ee the effect, which the impre&s;&s;ions of it are likely to have upon the future periods of education. From facts, children pa&s;s to general max|ims; their impre&s;&s;ions are a&s;&s;orted into cla&s;&s;es; and from comparing the effects of outward objects on their &s;en&s;ibil|ity, they acquire principles, or the art of rea&s;oning. "Children are per|verted in their mother's arms: they ac|quire di&s;po&s;itions, principles, or charac|ters,
<PB N="134" REF="022570_0133_0FB9979FC4714C70">
very difficult to remove, as early as the art of walking. The di&s;po&s;ition, hu|mor, and temper, which have been form|ed early, under injudicious or bad man|agement, are called, emphatically, by the &s;criptures, "the law of &s;in" in the habit, or con&s;titution."</P>
<P>THE inference has been ju&s;tly drawn from the experience of an ingenious writ|er, that it is a truth, &s;u&s;ceptible of demon|&s;tration, that the pre&s;ent method of edu|cation &s;hould be inverted; and children be led from facts to &s;entiments, maxims, or principles; not from principles or &s;en|timents to facts. He affirms that he had greater difficulties, even in the fir&s;t period of education, with the rudiments of bad principles and pa&s;&s;ions, or the commence|ment of bad habits, than he &s;hould have had with the whole education of children, delivered to him with the u&s;ual innocence, or ignorance, of infancy; and he goes on to ob&s;erve&mdash;</P>
<P>"THE capacity, as well as character of a man, depends greatly on the pa&s;&s;ions of
<PB N="135" REF="022570_0134_0FB997A84ED71A50">
infancy; particularly on early a&s;&s;ocia|tions, or early habits. This truth e&s;capes common ob&s;ervers; becau&s;e it depends on a number of minute circum&s;tances, which appear &s;eparately in&s;ignificant. When the&s;e circum&s;tances are combined in their effects, they become important in morals; but continuing unconnected in the imaginations of parents, opportunities of regulating or correcting them are lo&s;t. They are &s;o numerous, that they affect the con&s;titution and mind of a child in methods &s;o various, that per&s;ons not ac|cu&s;tomed to the art of inve&s;tigation or rea&s;oning, &s;u&s;pend all judgment and di|rection, until minute di&s;po&s;itions have a&s;|&s;orted them&s;elves into principles and hab|its, or have impre&s;&s;ed an indelible char|acter on the mind. This effect takes place, in &s;ome children early; in others, late. I have known the character com|pletely fixed in nine or ten years.</P>
<P>ERROR and negligence, re&s;pecting the ingredients of pa&s;&s;ions or habits, in the fir&s;t period of education, are con&s;tant al|loys
<PB N="136" REF="022570_0135_0FB997AC09CC3978">
to the excellence afterwards acquired. Injudicious indulgence, carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, or &s;e|verity, fixes in our con&s;titution ill health and bad temper, which mark the body or countenance with deformity, and render the mind incapable of great acqui&s;itions, either of &s;cience or happine&s;s. The knowl|edge we po&s;&s;e&s;s, is often like liquor poured into di&s;tempered ve&s;&s;els. Hence the a&s;ton|i&s;hing inequalities of modern characters. Minds and figures ca&s;t in heavenly moulds, actuated by the pa&s;&s;ions of fiends; great acqui&s;itions in &s;cience, di&s;honored by mean habits; or the be&s;t principles of morality, a&s;&s;ociated with the wor&s;t vices. The&s;e contradictions are &s;o familiar, that we &s;el|dom expect in our acquaintance, general uniformity or con&s;i&s;tency of character. We &s;ay, with candid compa&s;&s;ion, of one, that he has great wi&s;dom or learning; but is licentious or immoral in his private conduct: of another, that he is con&s;cien|tious in the principles and forms of re|ligion; but he is unhappy in his temper, deceitful in his profe&s;&s;ions, or oppre&s;&s;ive

<P>THE children have now arrived at that age, which is generally con&s;idered as the &s;econd &s;tage in their education. I have dwelt the longer on that period, which, to many, appears of little u&s;e in the bu&s;ine&s;s of education, and for that rea&s;on: it is the mo&s;t favorable &s;ea&s;on for moral culture, and may be improved in &s;uch a manner, as greatly to facilitate in|&s;truction in letters, and progre&s;s in arts. If the foundation be not well laid, the &s;uper&s;tructure will totter and fall to the ground. Children are, at fir&s;t, in a &s;tate of entire dependence; they are helple&s;s, and pa&s;&s;ive in every thing: but it does not follow, that they &s;hould remain &s;o forever, or be kept in that condition be|yond the natural period, by the habits of
<PB N="138" REF="022570_0137_0FB997AEDA1F0EB8">
education. Nature prompts them to pant for independence, and to help them|&s;elves as &s;oon as they have power; but education, e&s;pecially among the wealthy, often checks the&s;e efforts of nature, and keeps them dependent, and helple&s;s all their days. Unaccu&s;tomed to exert their power, at an early period, and being al|ways waited upon, they find them&s;elves in the condition of the indolent and help|le&s;s nobleman, who, having never been taught to dre&s;s him&s;elf, was obliged to lie in bed, flat upon his back, "like a turtle on an alderman's kitchen table, until a &s;ervant came to dre&s;s him&punc;"</P>
<P>INDOLENCE, incapacity for vigorous exertion, and dulne&s;s of apprehen&s;ion, are the effects of furni&s;hing children with ev|ery thing they want, without any thought, or action of their own. Our health, ac|tivity, and u&s;efulne&s;s in the world, de|pend on the powers of exertion being braced up, by early habits of action. Ex|erci&s;e is as requi&s;ite to produce &s;trength and agility of body, as application to
<PB N="139" REF="022570_0138_0FB997B7B57E1780">
&s;tudy, is to enlarge and invigorate the powers of the mind. The following pic|ture&s;que account of the indolence of young people in England, born heirs to great e&s;tates, I think, reflects great di&s;|honor upon parents, however wealthy they may be.</P>
<P>"IF there is any characteri&s;tic peculiar to the young people of fa&s;hion, of the pre&s;ent age, it is their lazine&s;s, or extreme unwillingne&s;s to attend to any thing that can give them the lea&s;t di&s;quietude; without any degree of which they would fain enjoy all the luxuries of life, in con|tradiction to the di&s;po&s;itions of provi|dence, and the nature of things. They would have great e&s;tates without manage|ment, great expen&s;es without accounts, and great families without di&s;cipline, or economy; in &s;hort they are fit only to be inhabitants of Lubberland, where, as the child's geography informs us, men lie upon their backs with their mouths open, and it rains fat pigs ready roa&s;ted."</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="022570_0139_0FB997BBF22EFC20">IT is to be regretted that any thing &s;im|ilar to this &s;hould ever have crept into America; where an e&s;tate, however large, &s;eldom pa&s;&s;es beyond a third generation; becau&s;e that generation is brought up in indolence, and indulged in extravagant expen&s;es. While the rich keep po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of their e&s;tates, they are as liable to accidents as other men, which require vig|ilance to fore&s;ee, exertion to guard again&s;t, or invention to extricate them&s;elves from. "The &s;ons of Princes, &s;aid Carneades the philo&s;opher, learn nothing to purpo&s;e, but to ride the great hor&s;e; in other ex|erci&s;es every one bends to them; but a great hor&s;e will throw the &s;on of a King with no more remor&s;e than the &s;on of a cobler."</P>
<P>I BELIEVE you were well acquainted with Mr. &mdash;, when he was in flouri&s;h|ing circum&s;tances, and with the manner in which his family was managed: the children mu&s;t never help them&s;elves to any thing which required the lea&s;t labor; this would make the boys &s;ervile and the

I have heard of their &s;ay|ing that they never &s;o much as help|ed them&s;elves to the water with which they wa&s;hed their face and hands: if a &s;ervant was not at liberty to get it for them, they would either wait till he was, or go unwa&s;hed for the day: indolence and inertne&s;s grew up with them. Too lazy to attend to any bu&s;ine&s;s, and wholly de&s;titute of economy, they &s;oon &s;quander|ed away their ample patrimony; and were reduced to extreme poverty, with|out the knowledge, or powers of exertion, nece&s;&s;ary to remedy their circum&s;tances. In this helple&s;s and di&s;tre&s;sful &s;ituation, their only boa&s;t was, that they never had done any work in their lives: and in them was literally verified the old adage, "He that will not work &s;hall not eat." Having dragged out a life of inactivity, not of enjoyment; and reduced to ex|treme poverty, they &s;unk under the weight of infirmity, contracted by indolence, and mingled with the common ma&s;s of inert matter.</P>

<P>MR. Bloom&s;grove was a man of &s;uf|ficient property to have kept a &s;ervant to attend each of his children: but, appriz|ed of the dangerous effects of &s;uch a mea&s;|ure, and convinced that indu&s;try is the &s;ure&s;t guard again&s;t vice, and the be&s;t means of &s;ecuring health and the powers of enjoyment; he early habituated them to it. It &s;ometimes happens that mothers cannot bear to &s;ee their children making efforts to do any thing which can be done, or procured for them. But, happy for O&s;ander and Rozella, their mamma al|ways encouraged them in exerci&s;ing their
<PB N="144" REF="022570_0143_0FB997CA87515E08">
invention to make their own play things. No toys were purcha&s;ed for them, as is common among mo&s;t wealthy parents. The purcha&s;e of the&s;e has a di&s;agreeable effect on the mind. They are of no con|&s;equence any longer than they have the appearance of novelty; familiarity &s;oon de&s;troys the plea&s;ure, or breeds di&s;gu&s;t: others mu&s;t be procured, or the mind will not re&s;t at ea&s;e: if procured, the de&s;ire of novelty is increa&s;ed, and the power of en|joyment dimini&s;hed; for enjoyment de|pends much on our own exertions. That which we acquire at the expen&s;e of &s;ome labor, we value; and we enjoy, with pe|culiar reli&s;h, the fruits of our own inven|tion and indu&s;try.</P>
<P>GREAT advantages aro&s;e to tho&s;e child|ren from their being left to invent amu&s;e|ments for them&s;elves, and make their own toys. By this happy contrivance, their invention was put upon the &s;tretch to form &s;chemes for amu&s;ement, and con|&s;truct machines for play: this inured them to think and recollect for them&s;elves;
<PB N="145" REF="022570_0144_0FB997CDFA3DB2D0">
and it brought into exerci&s;e, all tho&s;e pow|ers which are of con&s;tant u&s;e in the com|mon affairs of life. While invention was employed in devi&s;ing, action was nece&s;|&s;ary to carry into effect whatever they had planned; this induced the habits of ac|tivity and indu&s;try.</P>
<P>I HAVE before ob&s;erved, that they were furni&s;hed with &s;uch opportunities and means of amu&s;ement, as had a tendency to encourage and promote the&s;e habits, by a privilege in the garden. O&s;ander cannot, indeed, make his tools; but at the age of nine, he can dig up his ground in the garden and dre&s;s it; for on the&s;e con|ditions he holds it. He can make his own bow and arrows. His marbles are of his own con&s;truction. His ball, top, &s;led, and whatever &s;erves for amu&s;ement, are the effect of his own handicraft, with very little a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The&s;e he continued to enjoy without being cloyed, or wi&s;h|ing for any others; becau&s;e he was fir&s;t employed in making, and then in u&s;ing them.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="022570_0145_0FB997D354E482C0">ROZELLA cannot dig her garden, this would be too ma&s;culine an employment for a little girl; but &s;he can pull out the weeds and keep the bed clean. She can dre&s;s and undre&s;s her doll; and carry it thro all the ceremonies of giving and receiving vi&s;its. She nur&s;es, in&s;tructs, and corrects it; and is never tired of the bu&s;ine&s;s, becau&s;e it gives her exerci&s;e; and &s;he enjoys the fruit of her own labor. Children are naturally active; and if this &s;timulus is kept alive by proper induce|ments to indu&s;try, they will never langui&s;h for want of occupation, nor will their amu&s;ements become in&s;ipid by familiarity. Con&s;equences mo&s;t fatal to their improve|ment, and future u&s;efulne&s;s, may be ex|pected, when they can find neither em|ployment nor amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>AS idlene&s;s is the inlet to almo&s;t every vice, with young people, &s;o a habit of &s;auntering, when children, has been the ruin of many a hopeful genius. Idlene&s;s too has an ill effect on the temper: for want of exerci&s;e and employment to fix
<PB N="147" REF="022570_0146_0FB997D44AF38338">
and engage the attention, children, as well as adult per&s;ons, grow out of humor, and become peevi&s;h.</P>
<P>OUR little ma&s;ter and his &s;i&s;ter are in no danger of being &s;oured on this ac|count; or of becoming ru&s;ty for want of action: between the employments com|mitted to them, and their own indu&s;try in inventing and making things for amu&s;e|ment, they find no idle hours. Children love employment; but cannot bear long confinement: their greate&s;t plea&s;ures would &s;oon become irk&s;ome, if impo&s;ed as a ta&s;k. Application and relaxation &s;hould, therefore, &s;o divide their time, as to make both a plea&s;ure. Nothing &s;hould be a&s;&s;igned children under the idea of a ta&s;k, becau&s;e the very idea is di&s;gu&s;ting.</P>
<P>THEY &s;hould be fired with a &s;pirit of emulation to equal, or excel others; and their indu&s;try, &s;hould be made to carry its own reward with it; or, at lea&s;t, held &s;o near to view, as never to lo&s;e its influence.</P>
<P>OSANDER never thinks much of what he has to get by heart, or to tran&s;late;
<PB N="148" REF="022570_0147_0FB997D5ED958670">
becau&s;e it is cheerfully propo&s;ed to him as &s;omething which will be beneficial to him|&s;elf; and will make him find out &s;ome|thing he did not know before: he has not &s;o much given him to get, but he may ea&s;ily attain it within the time; and that time is not &s;o long, as to make him re&s;tle&s;s by confinement. Rozella is &s;o accu&s;tom|ed to order and regularity, as to go, with equal facility, to her book, her work, or her play.</P>
<P>SUCH are the effects of indu&s;try, that while the indu&s;trious grow rich, the rich, without it, grow poor. The following anecdote is a &s;triking proof of this truth. "A gentleman having an e&s;tate in land, of two hundred pounds yearly, kept the whole in his hands. Finding that this did not an&s;wer, he was forced to &s;ell half to pay his debts, and let the remainder to a tenant for one and twenty years. To|wards the end of the lea&s;e, the tenant a&s;k|ed the landlord, if he would part with his land&mdash;"Prithee, tell me," &s;ays the land|lord, "how it could be, that I could not
<PB N="149" REF="022570_0148_0FB997DE01D1AAF0">
live upon twice as much, being my own, and yet that you, having but half, and paying rent for it, have been able in twenty one years to buy it?" "Sir," &s;aid the farmer, "when any thing was to be done, you &s;aid, go and do it; but I always &s;aid, come let <HI>us</HI> go and do it; and &s;o not only &s;aw my bu&s;ine&s;s done, but a&s;&s;i&s;ted." The expedience of fixing habits of indu&s;try in youth, will be evident, if we con&s;ider, that it is by dil|igence, the family of the poor is &s;upport|ed, and the mechanic contributes to the convenience of others, or finds his own &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. In trade and commerce, for|tunes are acquired, or enjoyments diver|&s;ified, by diligence. It is by diligence, the patriot obtains di&s;tinction; the &s;tu|dent acquires knowledge; and man a&s;|&s;umes the honorable character of pro|found wi&s;dom, or exten&s;ive benevolence. The vulgar apprehen&s;ion of genius is like the vulgar doctrine of prede&s;tination: the elect, in both ca&s;es, are generally worth|le&s;s; they imagine them&s;elves entitled by
<PB N="150" REF="022570_0149_0FB997E04C99B158">
favor, to advantages, which others mu&s;t obtain by indu&s;try." But the truth is, indu&s;try is not only a handmaid of virtue, but the high road to every kind of emi|nence.</P>
<P>IN order to make the activity of youth become a habit of indu&s;try, it is nece&s;&s;ary to direct it to permanent objects: if the young mind is di&s;tracted by a variety of trifles, children will proceed at random; and will be determined to become u&s;eful, or otherwi&s;e, as circum&s;tances, or the peo|ple with whom they a&s;&s;ociate, happen to point the way.</P>
<P>FAMILIAR &s;tories, &s;uited to explain and encourage the particular virtues he would recommend to his children, were thought by Mr. Bloom&s;grove to have a great effect upon their minds: with the&s;e he u&s;ed often to amu&s;e them, accompany|ing them with intere&s;ting remarks &s;uitable to their age.</P>

with nece&s;&s;ary uten&s;ils for the de&s;ign, and embarked with his friends and fellow ad|venturers, Rizzio, Alphon&s;o, and others, who were in&s;pired with the like ardor for becoming rich without labor. Don Juan took on board only &s;ome tools for hu&s;|bandry; a few camels, with harne&s;s for la|bor; &s;ome &s;heep, corn, and &s;eeds of various kinds of vegetables.</P>
<P>"THIS appeared a &s;trange kind of cargo to the &s;eekers of gold.&mdash;'Papa,' &s;aid O&s;ander, 'is it not better to have gold, than ploughs and &s;heep, and &s;o have to work hard?'&mdash;'Stay a little, my dear,' &s;aid Mr. Bloom&s;grove, 'and hear the &s;tory out.' They arrived at South A|merica, after &s;ome difficulty from contrary winds, and a leaky ve&s;&s;el. No &s;ooner had they landed, than Roderico, with his companions, prepared to go in &s;earch of gold. Don Juan told his brother he would tarry near the &s;hore until his re|turn. They quite ridiculed his weak|ne&s;s, in &s;taying to till the land in a coun|try where gold abounded. Roderico
<PB N="153" REF="022570_0152_0FB997EBA8EA1F00">
harangued his men upon the occa&s;ion, and reproached his brother's weakne&s;s in diverting him&s;elf with &s;uch trifling con|cerns. They all applauded Roderico's &s;pirit, except one old Spaniard, who ex|pre&s;&s;ed &s;ome doubts whether Don Juan would appear &s;o unwi&s;e, in the end, as they now thought him to be. Taking their leave of him, they travelled day after day, thro fore&s;ts, over mountains, thro vales, and over &s;wift rivers. They were not to be di&s;couraged however by any difficulties. They tried &s;everal places without &s;ucce&s;s. At la&s;t, after having travelled many days, &s;ometimes &s;corched with the inten&s;e heat of the &s;un, and at others drenched with violent &s;howers of rain, they found a quantity of ore. Here they labored ince&s;&s;antly until their pro|vi&s;ions were exhau&s;ted. But the ore was &s;o plenty, that they could not think of quitting the ground. They fed on the roots and berries, which they could find. &mdash;'Oh, papa,' exclaimed Rozella, 'I wi&s;h I had &s;ome of tho&s;e good berries:
<PB N="154" REF="022570_0153_0FB997EDD175B230">
but could not tho&s;e poor folks get any thing el&s;e to eat? I wi&s;h they had &s;ome of our good dinner' 'Yes, my dear,' continued he&mdash;they caught a few birds and &s;ome &s;quirrels; but after they began to melt and refine the ore, they could not find any more of the&s;e; and they continued &s;o long, that roots and berries became very &s;carce. Their labor was &s;o hard and the famine &s;o &s;evere, that &s;everal of the company died, and the re&s;t with difficulty returned to the place where they had left Don Juan, and carried with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">em the gold, which they had acquired, at the expen&s;e of &s;o much pain, and with the lo&s;s of &s;everal lives.</P>
<P>"DON Juan had employed all this time in cultivating a fine &s;pot of interval, which he had pitched upon for that purpo&s;e; and which, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the labor|ers he carried with him, had now produc|ed an ample crop of potatoes and other things &s;uitable to the climate, and nece&s;|&s;ary to &s;upport life. His &s;heep had brought lambs, and all were in excellent

order. He had caught and dried a great quantity of fi&s;h; &s;o that he had a plenty of provi&s;ion. He received his brother very kindly; and inquired how he had &s;ucceeded. Roderico informed him, that they had &s;ucceeded well in getting gold; but that they were almo&s;t &s;tarved, and that &s;everal of their companions had per|i&s;hed from want and hard&s;hip. He re|que&s;ted his brother, to furni&s;h them with &s;ome provi&s;ion immediately, as they had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted &s;everal days only on the bark and roots of trees. Don Juan very de|liberately reminded him of their fir&s;t agree|ment, not to interfere with each other's gains. But added, if he had a mind to buy the fruits of his indu&s;try, he could &s;upply &s;ome pre&s;ent relief, but not oth|erwi&s;e.</P>
<P>"THIS &s;eemed unkind in a brother. But they mu&s;t either &s;tarve with their gold in hand, or part with it to procure provi&s;ions at a mo&s;t exorbitant price. So that their gold was &s;oon gone in procuring the bare nece&s;&s;aries of life. When Roderico and
<PB N="156" REF="022570_0155_0FB997F28D2C5C38">
his company had been obliged to give his brother all the gold they had acquired, thro &s;o many mi&s;eries, Don Juan pro|po&s;ed returning to their native country, from which they had been ab&s;ent a con|&s;iderable time. But Roderico was &s;o highly offended with his brother, for his conduct, which appeared &s;o cruel, that he declared he would never more go home with a brother who could u&s;e him &s;o ill. Upon this Don Juan embraced him af|fectionately and &s;aid&mdash;'And do you re|ally &s;uppo&s;e, my dear brother, that I in|tend to deprive you of the fruits of your arduous and dangerous undertaking?&mdash; No: &s;ooner may I cea&s;e to reap the fruits of my own indu&s;try; and the earth refu&s;e me my daily bread, than I &s;hould be guilty of &s;uch a piece of conduct. I on|ly wi&s;hed to correct your impetuous thir&s;t for riches, and to &s;hew you that indu&s;try was the &s;ure road to acquire the means of &s;upplying the calls of nature; and that he who had exhau&s;ted all his &s;trength in accumulating gold might pine with want.

Here, my brother, take your gold; and go with me to vi&s;it our native land, and dear friends; and let them &s;ee that you have acquired wi&s;dom as well as gold.' The a&s;toni&s;h|ed Roderico acknowledged the &s;uperior wi&s;dom, genero&s;ity, and goodne&s;s of his brother, and declared 'that he now found, from his own experience, that in|du&s;try was better than gold; and that he would endeavor to &s;hew his friends, on his return, that the wi&s;dom he had learnt from his brother, was of more real value to him, than all the gold he had acquired.'</P>
<P>"EMBRACING his brother in a mo&s;t cor|dial manner, he begged him to accept half of his riches; but he po&s;itively refu&s;ed, &s;aying&mdash;'He that can rai&s;e food enough to maintain him&s;elf, can never be in want of gold.'

<P>THE habits of indu&s;try not only af|ford a &s;ecure guard again&s;t vice, but pre|pare the way for the practice of every vir|tue. Of all the virtues which dignify human nature, and di&s;tingui&s;h the char|acters of men, benevolence may be con|&s;idered as the capital. This amiable qual|ity does not &s;tand in oppo&s;ition to &s;elf love, but is an expan&s;ion of it. Selfi&s;h|ne&s;s is oppo&s;ite to benevolence. This is the root of mo&s;t of tho&s;e evils and mi&s;eries which &s;ocieties experience. It regards our&s;elves to the exclu&s;ion of others; and is a de&s;ire of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, or having domin|ion over more, than we have need of, without any regard to others. This is an evil weed that &s;hould be rooted out, or rather prevented by the careful hand of education; and the oppo&s;ite virtue, a
<PB N="159" REF="022570_0158_0FB997FD829D8E40">
readine&s;s to impart to others, &s;hould be nouri&s;hed with equal care. Among other little anecdotes, by which Mrs. Bloom&s;|grove endeavored to cheri&s;h a benevolent di&s;po&s;ition in the children when young, was the following.</P>
<P>"A mou&s;e, by accident, coming under the paw of a lion, begged hard for life, urging that clemency was the faire&s;t at|tribute of power. The lion generou&s;ly &s;et it at liberty. The mou&s;e afterwards ob&s;erving the lion entangled in the toils of the hunter, flew to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, gnaw|ing the net to pieces, and &s;et him free. Hence an u&s;eful le&s;&s;on: neglect no op|portunity of doing good; for even the lowe&s;t may happen to be u&s;eful to the highe&s;t."</P>
<P>IF we had been intended to be wholly &s;elfi&s;h, human life would have been much &s;horter than it is; for all corporeal plea&s;|ures, even the mo&s;t delightful, pre&s;ently lo&s;e their reli&s;h; are followed with &s;atiety, and di&s;gu&s;t; and can only be pre&s;erved by a change of objects; and, even the&s;e,
<PB N="160" REF="022570_0159_0FB998061D940580">
&s;oon lo&s;e their charms, and novelty it&s;elf lo&s;es the power of plea&s;ing. It is quite otherwi&s;e with benevolence. This, like the well nerved arm, gathers &s;trength by exerci&s;e. The oftener we repeat gen|erous actions, the more &s;hall we be in|clined to do them; and our plea&s;ure in doing good will increa&s;e in the &s;ame pro|portion. The &s;atisfaction it affords is not allayed, even by age, which allays ev|ery other enjoyment. The body may decay, but the plea&s;ure of doing good, when habitual, continues the &s;ame even to the la&s;t moment of life.</P>
<P>A QUALITY, productive of &s;o many hon|orable and la&s;ting effects, cannot be cul|tivated, in the young mind, with too much care and attention. Children, early in|&s;pired with the benevolent affections, will be &s;uperior to the prevalence of &s;elfi&s;h gratifications. They will be re&s;pectful to &s;uperiors; kind to their companions; civil and complai&s;ant to inferiors; charitable to the poor; compa&s;&s;ionate to the di&s;tre&s;&s;|ed, and ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t all in their power;
<PB N="161" REF="022570_0160_0FB9980D8FF27948">
even where there is no pro&s;pect of reward, but the &s;atisfaction of doing good.</P>
<P>THIS is very beautifully illu&s;trated, and recommended to univer&s;al practice by an ancient parable, which Mrs. Bloom&s;grove u&s;ed to repeat to the children with pecu|liar plea&s;ure, as it inculcated that di&s;in|tere&s;ted undi&s;criminating benevolence which regarded not, either nation or re|ligious di&s;tinctions in its exertions to do good, and was congenial to her heart. "A traveller, bound from Jeru&s;alem to Jericho, fell into the hands of a band of robbers; who wounded him in a mo&s;t barbarous manner, leaving him half dead. Two per&s;ons of note, from whom might be expected every expre&s;&s;ion of benevo|lence, travelling the &s;ame road, &s;aw him. 'Mamma,' cries the tender hearted Ro|zella, 'did they not take care of the poor man?'&mdash;'No, my dear,' continued &s;he; 'they pa&s;&s;ed by on the other &s;ide of the way, and did not &s;hew him the lea&s;t pity.' 'If I had been there,' interrupted O&s;and|er (for &s;he allowed them to interrupt her
<PB N="162" REF="022570_0161_0FB9980EEF1B1118">
by que&s;tions, or ob&s;ervations of their own; when rehear&s;ing to them) 'I would have given him all my money.'&mdash;'Very well, my dear, you &s;hould always be ready to do good with what you have, and pity tho&s;e you cannot relieve.' The poor man lay &s;ometime bleeding and weltering in his own gore, without any one to hear his groans, and pity his wretched condi|tion. At la&s;t there came along a man, of a different nation and religion from the wounded man: he was not a man of great reputation in the world, and never had an opportunity to &s;hew the full extent of his benevolence. But &s;uch an opportunity now offered, and he emb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ced it with plea&s;ure. No &s;ooner did he behold the tragical &s;cene, but his indignation ro&s;e again&s;t the perpetrators of it, and, touch|ed with commi&s;eration, he flew to the re|lief of the unfortunate &s;tranger; and, without inquiring who, or what he was, whether he belonged to Jeru&s;alem or Jericho, he in&s;tantly admini&s;tered nece&s;|&s;ary relief, pouring the oil and wine into
<PB N="163" REF="022570_0162_0FB9981041C76220">
his wound, which he had provided for his own u&s;e, on the way; &s;et him on his own bea&s;t, and carried him'to an inn, where he might be better accommodated; paid the ho&s;t a &s;um of money for the pre&s;ent, which, tho &s;mall, was all he could po&s;&s;ibly &s;pare from his own nece&s;&s;ary u&s;es; and became re&s;pon&s;ible for whatever charges might ari&s;e in the cour&s;e of his entire recovery.</P>
<P>"THIS was genuine benevolence! Here was the friend that loveth at all times, and the brother born for adver&s;ity! Go and do likewi&s;e, was the injunction, with which the prince of love and good will to men concluded the recital of the above tran&s;|action&mdash;That is, imitate the example of this worthy man, in doing good as you have opportunity and ability; and never inquire whether a man is of your kindred, country, or nation, If he &s;tands in need of a&s;&s;i&s;tance."</P>
<P>TEACH your children, my dear &s;ir, to practi&s;e upon this divinely benevolent &s;cheme; and they will be the delight of

<P>IF ever the heart of parents had rea|&s;on to expand with joy, at beholding the good influence of in&s;truction and exam|ple upon their children; Mr. and Mrs. Bloom&s;grove had the utmo&s;t rea&s;on to rejoice in the growth of the benevolent affections in theirs. The principles of benevolence had been early inculcated, by a variety of maxims and actions &s;uited to their age. The little plant had been nouri&s;hed with great care, was con&s;tantly cheri&s;hed by exerci&s;e, and &s;upported by their own example. Nothing could have given them more plea&s;ure, than to &s;ee their youthful hearts dilating with this generous quality. In&s;tead of laying out their money for toys or &s;weetmeats, as mo&s;t other children did, they kept it to give to poor people, who frequented this
<PB N="165" REF="022570_0164_0FB9981B32C3F8C0">
ho&s;pitable dwelling; or to a&s;&s;i&s;t indigent families, in the neighborhood: the&s;e they were permitted to vi&s;it, accompanied by Fanny; in whom Mrs. Bloom&s;grove placed &s;o much confidence, that Rozella was committed to her care in tho&s;e excur|&s;ions.</P>
<P>THOSE families were very fond of their young vi&s;itants; for they u&s;ed to carry &s;omething for their relief, or to gratify their children. O&s;ander, who would &s;ometimes play unlucky tricks, threw &s;tones at a pigeon, which the children of one of tho&s;e families had tamed, and kill|ed it, while Fanny and Rozella were in the hou&s;e, di&s;tributing the things they had brought for their comfort. As &s;oon as the children knew that their pigeon was killed, there was great lamentation about it. Their mother endeavored to pacify them, telling them, "if it was O&s;ander who had committed the crime (for he had ab&s;conded) he did not do it intentionally, and &s;he did not doubt but he would give them another, for &s;he never knew him in|jure
<PB N="166" REF="022570_0165_0FB9981F3A31F300">
the poor, or any body el&s;e indeed." The mother's harangue prevailed; the children were quieted. Fanny and Ro|zella, who expre&s;&s;ed much &s;orrow for what had happened, and &s;hed many tears with the poor children, took leave, &s;aying, they would acquaint his papa; and they did not doubt he would make him give them another. When they reached home, they found O&s;ander very pen&s;ive, for he had not yet ventured to tell what he had done, tho it had been his practice frankly to confe&s;s, when he had commit|ted any mi&s;chief; and his mamma did not choo&s;e to que&s;tion him, le&s;t he &s;hould be tempted to utter a fal&s;ehood. The whole affair was di&s;clo&s;ed on their return. His mamma remon&s;trated again&s;t &s;uch conduct, and e&s;pecially, in not confe&s;&s;ing it to her, when he fir&s;t came home. She directed him to take two of his be&s;t pul|lets, and go immediately, and make &s;atis|faction for the damage he had done. He cheerfully embraced the terms of peace with them, and by that means found peace
<PB N="167" REF="022570_0166_0FB99823C3AD19E0">
in his own mind. He begged his mamma to give him &s;ome bi&s;cuit and chee&s;e to carry for the children. Being thus equip|ped with the nece&s;&s;ary means of a treaty of peace and friend&s;hip, he &s;oon reached the &s;pot, and &s;ettled every thing to mutu|al &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>THE plea&s;ure of doing good, is the no|ble&s;t reward which generous minds can receive from beneficent actions: this is a reward, which time cannot change, ru&s;t corrupt, nor thieves break thro and &s;teal. With this &s;en&s;e then, &s;hould the young mind be in&s;pired; and, by this con&s;idera|tion, it &s;hould be exerci&s;ed in acts of be|neficence. I cannot but think that Mr. Locke's plan, for making children charit|able, has a greater tendency to make them &s;elfi&s;h and covetous, than to in&s;pire true benevolence and genero&s;ity. Speaking of liberality, in the u&s;e of what they po&s;|&s;e&s;s, and of rooting out the oppo&s;ite prin|ple, covetou&s;ne&s;s, he &s;ays&mdash;</P>
<P>"THIS &s;hould be encouraged by great commendation and credit, and con&s;tantly
<PB N="168" REF="022570_0167_0FB9982ADC38BB40">
taking care, that the child lo&s;es nothing by his liberality. Let all the in&s;tances he gives of &s;uch freene&s;s, be always repaid with intere&s;t; and let him &s;en&s;ibly per|ceive that the kindne&s;s, he &s;hews to others, is no ill hu&s;bandry for him&s;elf; but that it brings a return of kindne&s;s, both from tho&s;e who receive it and tho&s;e who look on."&mdash;Sect. 110. But if all men acted upon this principle, what mu&s;t have been the fate of the unfortunate man who lay wounded, helple&s;s, and alone in the dreary pa&s;s between Jeru&s;alem and Jericho? Habitual good actions, prompted only by the pro&s;pect of gain, will, like untimely fruit, drop off when no longer nouri&s;hed by &s;uch hopes; and the &s;ecret alms will cea&s;e to ri&s;e as a memorial of heartfelt be|nevolence before God.</P>
<P>THE following method has been pro|po&s;ed, by Lord Kaimes, to habituate children to a humane and generous di&s;|po&s;ition. "Give to each of your child|ren, a &s;mall &s;um for charity. Let them account to you for the di&s;po&s;al; and to
<PB N="169" REF="022570_0168_0FB9982D6529E2B0">
the child, who has made the mo&s;t judi|cious di&s;tribution, give double the &s;um, to be laid out in the &s;ame way," Certain it is, that &s;uch actions de&s;erve great ap|plau&s;e; and it is as certain, that a benev|olent di&s;po&s;ition may be increa&s;ed by re|peating them. Compa&s;&s;ion and tender|ne&s;s &s;hould be &s;o cheri&s;hed in children, as that they will part without reluctance with their own property, even that of which they were very fond, to relieve the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. "The Earl of Elgin permit|ted his two &s;ons, in their hours of play, to a&s;&s;ociate with the boys in the neighbor|hood, which he thought better, than to have them expo&s;ed to be corrupted at home by his &s;ervants, filling them with notions of their rank and quality. One day, the two boys being called to dinner, a young lad, their companion, &s;aid, 'I'll wait till you return, as there is no dinner at home for me.' Have you no money to buy it? 'No.' 'Papa, &s;ays the eld|e&s;t, what was the price of the &s;ilver buc|kles you gave me?' 'Five &s;hillings.'
<PB N="170" REF="022570_0169_0FB998326EF8DF30">
'Let me have the money, and I'll give you the buckles.' It was done accord|ingly. The Earl, inquiring privately, found that the money had been given to the lad. The buckles were returned, and the boy was highly commended for being &s;o kind to his companions."</P>
<P>THE following in&s;tance of genero&s;ity, no le&s;s de&s;erves notice: One day, as O|&s;ander was going with Fanny and his lit|tle &s;i&s;ter, on one of their charitable excur|&s;ions to &s;ee a poor family; pa&s;&s;ing thro an exten&s;ive vale, they came to an hazel cop&s;e, where they found one of the child|ren picking &s;ome ra&s;pberries. As they approached him, he began to cry: they a&s;ked what he cried for; he told them that his mamma, his brother, and one of his &s;i&s;ters, were very &s;ick and had nothing to eat. They accompanied him to the hou&s;e, or rather the hut; and, to their great &s;urpri&s;e, they found the two child|ren &s;ick in a little open place, with very little to refre&s;h, or cover them; and their mother &s;carce able to do any thing for
<PB N="171" REF="022570_0170_0FB99833AAA56F48">
them, or for her&s;elf; and her hu&s;band gone abroad to hard labor, in order to get &s;omething for them, but could not be at home till night. Struck with the ap|pearance of poverty and di&s;tre&s;s in this dreary abode, the vi&s;itants could afford them but little aid, at this time, except their &s;ympathetic tears, of which they were very liberal. They ha&s;ten home, that they may relate the melancholy tale; and procure &s;ome effectual means of re|lief. They all &s;peak as one; and each is eager to be foremo&s;t in telling what they had &s;een, and in offering &s;ome of their own things for the relief of this poor family. Fanny, O&s;ander, and Rozella, all declare that they are willing to part with any of their things, if they may go and carry them.</P>
<P>LIBERALITY appeared &s;o blended with &s;ympathy in this triplicate of almoners, who&s;e only &s;trife was to excel each other in acts of genero&s;ity, that it drew tears of joy from Mrs. Bloom&s;grove's eyes, while her heart glowed with compa&s;&s;ion for the
<PB N="172" REF="022570_0171_0FB9983C97A6B7D0">
poor and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. That the ardor of their benevolent feelings might not be damped, and that they might experience the plea&s;ure of their own actions, &s;he per|mitted them to carry &s;ome of their own clothing and bed furniture, a&s;&s;uring them that they did well, but that they mu&s;t not expect her to replace them again: they all declare, with one voice, that they did not wi&s;h it. A &s;ervant was di&s;patched, to be the carrier of the goods, with &s;ome jel|lies, pottage, and &s;uch other things as Mrs. Bloom&s;grove thought mo&s;t &s;uitable for them. Never was charity be&s;towed more opportunely, or with a better grace; nor received with more apparent gratitude. The offering was made with as much avid|ity as it could be received; and it would have been difficult from appearances, to &s;ay, who were mo&s;t ble&s;t, the giver or the receivers.</P>

As it was the mid&s;t of winter, and the floods were out, it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to wade, thro the lower room, to a ladder, which &s;erved in&s;tead of &s;tairs. The chamber (and it was the only one) was &s;o low, that he could not &s;tand upright in it; there was one window which admitted the air as freely as the light, for the rags which had been &s;tuffed into the broken panes were now taken out to contribute to the covering of a newborn infant. In a dark corner of the room &s;tood a &s;mall bed&s;tead without furniture, and on it lay the dead mother, who had ju&s;t expired in labor for want of proper a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>"THE father was &s;itting on a little &s;tool by the fire place, tho there was no fire, and endeavoring to keep the infant warm in his bo&s;om; five of the &s;even children, half naked, were a&s;king their father for a piece of bread, while a fine boy, of about three years old, was &s;tanding by his moth|er

at the bed&s;ide, crying, as he was wont to do, 'Take me, take me, mammy.' 'Mammy is a&s;leep,' &s;aid one of his &s;i&s;|ters, with cheeks bedewed with tears; 'Mammy is a&s;leep, Johnny; go play with the baby on daddy's knee.'</P>
<P>"THE father took him upon his knee, and his grief which had hitherto kept him dumb, and in a &s;tate of temporary in&s;en&s;|ibility, bur&s;t out in a torrent of tears, and relieved his heart which &s;eemed ready to break. 'Don't cry, pray don't cry,' &s;aid the elde&s;t boy, 'the nur&s;e is coming up &s;tairs with a two penny loaf in her hand, and mammy will wake pre&s;ently, and I will carry her the large&s;t piece.' Upon this, an old woman crooked with age, and clothed in tatters, came hobbling on her little &s;tick into the room, and af|ter heaving a groan, calmly &s;at down and dre&s;&s;ed the child in its rags; then divided the loaf as far as it would go. Some re|lief was &s;oon &s;ent by tho&s;e to whom the old woman had applied. And afterwards a little contribution was rai&s;ed by the in|terpo&s;ition

<P>GRATITUDE is a virtue nearly allied to benevolence; they grow in the &s;ame &s;oil; and both indicate genero&s;ity and docility of mind. Gratitude is a &s;entiment natural to man. But, like all other native qualities, mu&s;t be cheri&s;hed and brought on to perfection, or it will decay; and, by mi&s;management, may be de&s;troyed. Nothing is more natural than to love tho&s;e who do us &s;ervice; and a child, when it begins to perceive the ben|efit of your care, will &s;oon be &s;en&s;ible of the obligation; and you can by this means acquire an authority over his heart which cannot be &s;haken. "Ingratitude, &s;ays Rou&s;&s;eau, would be more rare, if benefits upon u&s;ury were le&s;s common. The heart of man is &s;elf intere&s;ted, but never un|grateful;
<PB N="176" REF="022570_0175_0FB998463A20AD20">
and the obliged are le&s;s to be charged with ingratitude, than their bene|factors with &s;elf intere&s;t. If you &s;ell me your favors, let us &s;ettle the price; but if you pretend to give, and afterwards ex|pect to make terms with me, you are guilty of fraud; it is their being given gratis which render them ine&s;timable." A benefit which has the good of the re|ceiver in view, and does not appear to be de&s;igned for the emolument of the bene|factor, &s;eldom fails to in&s;pire gratitude.</P>
<P>IT is difficult to explain this virtue and the obligations of it to children. But the period of life, in which our young ma&s;ter and his &s;i&s;ter are at this time, does not re|quire much rea&s;oning; but familiarity to illu&s;trate by &s;ome happy allu&s;ions, or in|&s;tances, wherein they can &s;ee the opera|tion of the virtue that is recommended. The habits of a grateful temper may be laid in childhood, by always watching over the actions of children, and making them careful to return the favors they receive from one another, at lea&s;t by acknowledg|ments.

<P>"A VENETIAN &s;hip having tak|en a number of the Turks pri&s;oners, &s;old them, according to their barbarous cu&s;tom, to different per&s;ons in the ciry. One of tho&s;e &s;laves, named Ibraim, lived near the hou&s;e of a Venetian merchant who was very rich, and had but one &s;on, a lad of about twelve. As he had occa&s;ion fre|quently to pa&s;s Ibraim, he would &s;top and look very earne&s;tly at him. Ibraim ob&s;erving in the lad an appearance of be|nevolence and tenderne&s;s, was greatly plea&s;ed with him, and &s;ought to have his company more frequently. The lad took
<PB N="179" REF="022570_0178_0FB99854782565D8">
&s;uch a fancy to the &s;lave, that he renewed his vi&s;its much oftener than he had done, and brought him pre&s;ents for his relief and comfort. But tho Ibraim appeared always to be plea&s;ed with the innocent care&s;&s;es of his young friend, yet he ob|&s;erved Ibraim was very &s;orrowful &s;ome|times; and even &s;hed tears. Afflicted by the repeated appearance of grief and &s;or|row of heart, he at length reque&s;ted his father to make Ibraim happy if it was in his power.</P>
<P>"THE father, plea&s;ed with this in&s;tance of genero&s;ity in his &s;on, determined to &s;ee the Turk him&s;elf, and inquire into the cau&s;e of his &s;adne&s;s. The next day he went to &s;ee him, and looking at him for &s;ome time, was &s;truck with the mildne&s;s and hone&s;ty of his countenance. He at length &s;aid to him, 'Art thou Ibraim, of who&s;e courte&s;y and gentlene&s;s my little &s;on has &s;poken to me?' 'I am the un|fortunate Ibraim, who have been now three years a captive: during that &s;pace of time this youth is the only human be|ing
<PB N="180" REF="022570_0179_0FB99856244B3E98">
that &s;eems to have felt any compa&s;|&s;ion for my &s;ufferings; I mu&s;t confe&s;s therefore he is the only object to which I am attached in this barbarous country; and night and morning I pray that pow|er, who is equally the God of the Turks and Chri&s;tians, to grant him every ble&s;&s;ing he de&s;erves, and to pre&s;erve him from all the mi&s;eries I &s;uffer.' 'Indeed, Ibraim,' &s;aid the merchant, 'he is much obliged to you, altho from his pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, he does not appear much expo&s;ed to dan|ger. Tell me in what I can a&s;&s;i&s;t you? for my &s;on informs me that he often finds you in &s;orrow and tears.' 'And is it &s;trange,' &s;aid the Turk, 'that I &s;hould pine in &s;ilence and be the prey of contin|ual regret and &s;orrow, who am bereft of my liberty, the noble&s;t gift of heaven?' 'And yet how many thou&s;ands of our nation,' &s;aid the Venetian, 'do you re|tain in chains?' 'I have never been guilty of the inhuman practice of en&s;lav|ing my fellow creatures,' replied the Turk; 'I have never increa&s;ed my prop|erty
<PB N="181" REF="022570_0180_0FB9985907338180">
by de&s;poiling the Venetian merchants of theirs; for the cruelty of my country|men I am not accountable, more than you are for the barbarity of yours.'&mdash;A &s;well|ing tear &s;tarted from his eye, and bedew|ed his manly cheek.&mdash;Recollecting him|&s;elf immediately, and &s;miting gently on his brea&s;t, he bowed with reverence, and &s;aid, 'God is good, and man mu&s;t &s;ubmit to his decrees.' Affected with this ap|pearance of manly fortitude, the merchant &s;aid, 'Ibraim, I pity your &s;ufferings, and perhaps I may be able to relieve you. What would you do to regain your liber|ty?' 'I would,' &s;aid he, 'meet every pain and danger that can appal the heart of man.' 'The means of your deliver|ance,' &s;aid the merchant, 'are certain, without &s;o great a trial. I have in this city an inveterate enemy who has offered me every in&s;ult and injury that malice could invent; but he is as brave as he is haughty, and I have never dared re&s;ent them as they have de&s;erved. Here, Ibra|im, is the in&s;trument of your deliverance;
<PB N="182" REF="022570_0181_0FB9985FF1A580D0">
take this dagger; and when night has drawn her &s;able curtain over the city, go with me, avenge me of mine adver&s;ary, and you &s;hall be free.'</P>
<P>"INDIGNANT at the idea of being an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, he rejected the propo&s;al with di&s;|dain; and rai&s;ing his fettered arm as high as his chain would admit of, he &s;wore by the mighty prophet, Mahomet, 'that he would not &s;toop to &s;o vile a deed, to purcha&s;e the freedom of all his race.' The Venetian left him, adding, quite de|liberately, 'You will think better of this perhaps by the next time I vi&s;it you.'</P>
<P>"RETURNING the next day with his &s;on, he acco&s;ted Ibraim mildly, telling him, that tho he rejected his propo&s;al be|fore, he doubted not but he might now be convinced. 'In&s;ult not the mi&s;era|ble,' interrupted Ibraim warmly, 'with propo&s;als more &s;hocking than the chains I wear. Know, Chri&s;tian, that if thy re|ligion permits &s;uch deeds, every true Ma|hometan views them with indignation. From this moment therefore let us break

off all intercour&s;e, and be forever &s;trangers to each other.'&mdash;'No,' an&s;wered the mer|chant, embracing Ibraim, 'let us be more &s;trongly united than ever!&mdash;Pardon me this unnece&s;&s;ary trial of thy virtue. Mazza|rino has a &s;oul as aver&s;e to deeds of treach|ery and blood as Ibraim him&s;elf. From this moment, generous man, thou art free: thy ran&s;om is already paid, with no other obligation than that of remembering the affection of this thy young and faithful friend; and perhaps, hereafter, when thou &s;ee&s;t an unhappy Chri&s;tian groaning in Turki&s;h fetters, thy genero&s;ity may make thee think of Venice.'</P>
<P>"LANGUAGE cannot paint the ec&s;tacy of joy and gratitude, which Ibraim felt at intelligence &s;o agreeable, but unexpected. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to repeat the many and warm expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude, which he uttered as &s;oon as the fir&s;t tide of joy had &s;o abated as to give him utterance. He was &s;et free that very day, and Mazzarino put him on board a ve&s;&s;el bound to one of the Grecian I&s;lands, bade him an af|fectionate
<PB N="184" REF="022570_0183_0FB998677541BA60">
adieu, putting a pur&s;e of gold into his hands to bear his expen&s;es, and wi&s;hing him every ble&s;&s;ing. Their pray|ers and benedictions were mutual; for Ibraim regretted the &s;eparation from &s;uch a friend, who&s;e di&s;intere&s;ted goodne&s;s had &s;et him at liberty, and with tears and prayers bade him a long farewel.</P>
<P>"ABOUT &s;ix months after this an acci|dent took place, which had well nigh de|prived the Venetian merchant of all his hopes. Early in the morning of one of their Saint's days, while the family were locked in profound &s;leep, the hou&s;e had taken fire, which had made a gradual progre&s;s, and nearly involved the whole in flame, before it was di&s;covered. Scarce had the merchant been apprized of his danger in time to e&s;cape the awful con|flagration; and no &s;ooner had he e&s;caped with the &s;ervants who awoke him, than he inquired for his &s;on. What a tumult of agony and de&s;pair rent his brea&s;t, when informed that, in the general con&s;terna|tion, he had been forgotten, and was now
<PB N="185" REF="022570_0184_0FB998698D23C500">
alone in an upper room? He would have ru&s;hed headlong into the flames in a fruit|le&s;s &s;earch for his &s;on, had not his &s;ervants re&s;trained him. He offered half his e&s;tate to the intrepid man who would undertake the dangerous attempt of &s;aving his &s;on. Tempted by the greatne&s;s of the reward, ladders were immediately rai&s;ed and &s;ev|eral daring &s;pirits made the attempt, but were forced back by the violence of the flames. Upon the battlements of the hou&s;e, the unhappy youth now appeared, with extended arms, imploring aid, and &s;eemed devoted to inevitable de&s;truction. The father, beholding the imploring &s;on, and the certain fate that awaited him, &s;unk under the weight of the dreadful pro&s;pect, and became totally in&s;en&s;ible. In this moment of dreadful &s;u&s;pen&s;e, a man ru&s;hing thro the croud, with a coun|tenance indicating the mo&s;t determined re&s;olution, a&s;cended a ladder, and was &s;oon enveloped in a cloud of &s;moke. Lo&s;t to all appearance, the gazing multi|tude below &s;uppo&s;ed he mu&s;t peri&s;h in
<PB N="186" REF="022570_0185_0FB9986CBB093090">
the flames. What then mu&s;t have been their a&s;toni&s;hment, when they beheld him i&s;&s;uing forth with the lad in his arms, and de&s;cend the ladder, to revive the heart of an almo&s;t expiring parent? Or what mu&s;t have been his feelings, when he recovered his &s;en&s;es, at beholding in his own arms the darling of his heart, whom he had giv|en up for lo&s;t?&mdash;Tenderly embracing his &s;on, he earne&s;tly inquired for the man who dared ri&s;k his own life to &s;ave his &s;on. They &s;hewed him a man of noble &s;tature, but meanly clad, covered with &s;moke and &s;corched with heat, and all as one declared he was the intrepid adven|turer who had &s;aved his &s;on.</P>
<P>"MAZZARINO, pre&s;enting him a pur&s;e of gold, reque&s;ted his acceptance of that till he could make good his promi&s;e, which &s;hould be done the next day. 'No,' re|plied the &s;tranger, 'I do not &s;ell my blood. The plea&s;ure of &s;aving your &s;on is a re|ward greater than all your riches could give.' 'Generous man!' cried the mer|chant, 'thy voice, &s;ure, is not &s;trange to
<PB N="187" REF="022570_0186_0FB9986E1F85CF18">
me!&mdash;It is'&mdash;'Yes,' exclaimed the &s;on, throwing him&s;elf into the arms of his de|liverer&mdash;'it is my Ibraim!' Nothing could exceed the a&s;toni&s;hment and grat|itude of Mazzarino, to behold the deliv|erer of his &s;on in the per&s;on of Ibraim. Taking his benefactor with him to anoth|er hou&s;e of his, in a different part of the city, he inquired how he came into &s;lavery a &s;econd time, and why he had not made him acquainted with his condition. 'That captivity which has given me an oppor|tunity of &s;hewing that I was not altogeth|er unde&s;erving thy kindne&s;s, and of pre|&s;erving that dear youth, I &s;hall ever reck|on among&s;t the happie&s;t events of my life,' replied the generous Turk. 'But,' continued he, 'I will relate you the whole affair.</P>
<P>'I BELIEVE you never were made ac|quainted with the circum&s;tance of my aged father being a &s;harer with me in my captivity. Taken together by your gal|lies, we were &s;old to different ma&s;ters. Tho&s;e tears of &s;orrow, which &s;o attracted
<PB N="188" REF="022570_0187_0FB99875A7AA76F8">
the notice of your generous little &s;on, were &s;hed on account of the hard fate of my aged &s;ire; and no &s;ooner was I &s;et free by your unexampled bounty, than I went in &s;earch of the Chri&s;tian who had made him a &s;lave. Having found him, I offer|ed my&s;elf in his &s;tead, that he might go back and let his declining &s;un &s;et calm and &s;erene in his own country and amid&s;t the tender care of &s;urrounding friends. At length I prevailed on the Chri&s;tian, by adding the pur&s;e of gold your bounty had &s;upplied me with, to permit my fa|ther to go back in the ve&s;&s;el which was intended for me, without acquainting him with the means of his freedom. Since that time I have continued here, a willing &s;lave, to pay the debt of nature and of gratitude.'</P>
<P>"IBRAIM cea&s;ed&mdash;The Venetian ex|pre&s;&s;ed great a&s;toni&s;hment at &s;uch eleva|tion of mind; and pre&s;&s;ed him to accept the offer of half his e&s;tate, and to &s;pend the remainder of his days in Venice. Ibraim a&s;&s;ured his friend, that what he
<PB N="189" REF="022570_0188_0FB9987873193128">
had done was nothing more than the ob|ligations of gratitude and friend&s;hip re|quired; and therefore he mu&s;t decline accepting any further recompen&s;e than that of reflecting that he was not ungrate|ful. The merchant, &s;olicitous to make &s;ome returns worthy of &s;o much greatne&s;s of &s;oul, once more purcha&s;ed his freedom, and freighted a &s;hip on purpo&s;e to &s;end him back to his own country. Mo&s;t af|fectionately did he and his &s;on embrace their deliverer, and accompanying him to the &s;hip, they once more bade a la&s;t adieu, remaining on the &s;hore until the &s;hip lo&s;t it&s;elf under the horizon, and &s;ending for|ward their ardent prayers for a &s;afe and pro&s;perous voyage.</P>
<P>"MANY years having now elap&s;ed, dur|ing which time no intelligence had been received of Ibraim, the young Mazzarino had grown up, and become the mo&s;t ac|compli&s;hed, amiable youth of his age and rank. Having &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s in a mari|time town at &s;ome di&s;tance, which required di&s;patch in getting thither, he embarked,
<PB N="190" REF="022570_0189_0FB9987F34E18D48">
with his father, on board a Venetian ve&s;&s;el going to that place. The winds favored their views; they had gained more than half their voyage, with a fine pro&s;pect of &s;ecuring their whole pa&s;&s;age, when a Turki&s;h cor&s;air was &s;uddenly di&s;covered bearing down upon them; from which they &s;oon found it would be impo&s;&s;ible to e&s;cape. Fear and con&s;ternation &s;eized the greater part of the crew, and they &s;oon gave all over for lo&s;t. But the young Mazzarino, drawing his &s;word, reproach|ed them for their cowardice; and, by his manly courage and &s;peeches, rou&s;ed them to defend their liberties by one great ef|fort. The cor&s;air approached in awful &s;ilence, till within reach of the Venetian &s;hip, when on a &s;udden the very heavens were rent by the noi&s;e of the artillery, and the whole atmo&s;phere wrapt in &s;moke. Thrice did the Turks e&s;&s;ay, with horrid &s;houts, to board the Venetian &s;hip: as often were they repelled by the well timed firmne&s;s of young Mazzarino and the crew in&s;pired by his courage. Having lo&s;t
<PB N="191" REF="022570_0190_0FB99880B4C7A478">
many of their men, and &s;eeing no pro&s;pect of carrying their point, they, the Turks, began to draw off; and would have left the Venetians to pur&s;ue their voyage, had not two other &s;hips of their own nation, that in&s;tant, made their appearance, bear|ing down towards them with great &s;wift|ne&s;s. Upon their near approach, the Venetians, &s;eeing no po&s;&s;ibility of e&s;cape, and that re&s;i&s;tance would be madne&s;s, gave the &s;ign for &s;urrendering the &s;hip, and &s;oon &s;aw them&s;elves deprived of liberty, and loaded with irons. In this &s;ituation were they carried to Tunis, where they were brought forth and expo&s;ed in the public market to be &s;old for &s;laves. One after another of their companions were picked out, according to their &s;trength and vigor, and &s;old to different ma&s;ters. A Turk of uncommon dignity in his figure and manners, at length came towards the captives, and &s;urveying them with com|pa&s;&s;ion and tenderne&s;s, applied to the cap|tain for young Mazzarino, and inquired the price of this captive. The captain
<PB N="192" REF="022570_0191_0FB99888F3DC90C8">
&s;et a much higher price upon him, than he had done upon any of the others. The gentleman, a little &s;urpri&s;ed at the exor|bitant &s;um, a&s;ked the rea&s;on of this great di&s;tinction. The captain replied that he had animated the Chri&s;tians to the de&s;pe|rate re&s;i&s;tance they had made; and had been the occa&s;ion of mo&s;t of the damage they had &s;u&s;tained; and he was now de|termined to make him repay &s;ome of it, or he would gratify his revenge by &s;eeing him drudge for life in his victorious gal|ley. All this time had the young Maz|zarino fixed his eyes in a dumb &s;ilence on the ground; and now lifting them up, be|held, in the per&s;on who was talking with the captain, the manly and open countenance of Ibraim. Mazzarino cried out, 'Oh! my friend Ibraim.' No le&s;s a&s;toni&s;hed was the Turk, to find in the per&s;on of the captive his former companion and friend. He embraced him with the tran&s;ports of a parent who unexpectedly recovers a long lo&s;t child. But when Ibraim found that his Venetian benefactor and deliver|er
<PB N="193" REF="022570_0192_0FB9988BF49188E8">
was among the captives, he could no longer re&s;train the violence of his feelings: he bur&s;t into a flood of &s;orrow for the mi&s;|fortune of his friend: but recovering him|&s;elf, exclaimed, with uplifted hands, 'ble&s;&s;|ed be that providence which has made me the in&s;trument of &s;afety to my ancient benefactor.' Being informed where he &s;hould find him, he in&s;tantly repaired to the part of the market where Mazzarino &s;tood waiting his fate in manly, but &s;ilent de&s;pair. They were immediately known to each other. Their fir&s;t interview was ob&s;tructed by the fulne&s;s of their joy. As &s;oon as he was able, the Turk hailed him, friend, benefactor, and by every endear|ing name which friend&s;hip and gratitude could in&s;pire; ordered his chains in&s;tant|ly to be taken off, and conducted them both to his own magnificent hou&s;e in the city.</P>
<P>"AFTER &s;ome preliminary conver&s;ation upon their mutual fortunes, by which they were again brought to &s;ee each other in their pre&s;ent condition, Ibraim inform|ed
<PB N="194" REF="022570_0193_0FB9988CD31DD450">
them, that &s;oon after their goodne&s;s had re&s;tored him to his own country, he accepted a command in the Turki&s;h arm|ies; and that having the good fortune to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf upon &s;everal occa&s;ions, he had gradually been promoted, thro va|rious offices, to the dignity of Ba&s;haw of Tunis. 'Since I have enjoyed this po&s;t,' added he, 'there is nothing which I find in it &s;o agreeable, as the power it gives me of alleviating the misfortunes of tho&s;e unhappy Chri&s;tians who are taken pri&s;|oners by our cor&s;airs.

<HEAD>LETTER XXXIII.</HEAD>
<P>CAN you, my friend, after being fea&s;ted with &s;uch great and excellent vir|tues, reli&s;h the language of childhood, and
<PB N="196" REF="022570_0195_0FB99897A2AD3E38">
be plea&s;ed with the relations of infantile tran&s;actions? If not, I fear you will not give the following letter a cordial recep|tion. But you &s;hould recollect, that childhood is the period in which the foundation of the greate&s;t virtues is laid. It is, then, as nece&s;&s;ary to cultivate the fir&s;t principles of them in the young mind, as to cheri&s;h the &s;eed that is depo&s;ited in the earth in order to en&s;ure a future har|ve&s;t: and, like the &s;eed which contains all the &s;hades that expand in the flower, child|ren are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the qualities of men and women in miniature: to expand the&s;e is the bu&s;ine&s;s of education.</P>
<P>A CIRCUMSTANCE in the management of their dome&s;tic concerns, in the Bloom&s;|grove family, which I think worthy of notice in this place, is the confidence they repo&s;ed in the children. The voice of undoubted friend&s;hip has a great influ|ence over the human heart. When pa|rents have, by their prudent management with their children, convinced them that their good has been the object of all their
<PB N="197" REF="022570_0196_0FB99899FB0C41B8">
care, even of the puni&s;hments they have inflicted, &s;o as to cheri&s;h the natural &s;park of gratitude, they may venture to make them their confidents, both of &s;ecrets and of their intere&s;t. A greater inducement to fidelity, either in children or &s;ervants, can hardly be conceived of, than to be thought tru&s;t worthy. It lays hold of the be&s;t affections of human nature, the gen|erous and grateful feelings; and gains an a&s;cendency over the mind which an ex|ertion of authority could not effect; and will afford an effectual &s;ecurity again&s;t betraying the tru&s;t repo&s;ed.</P>
<P>IT is nece&s;&s;ary, however, always to pro|portion the magnitude of the tru&s;t to the age and fortitude of the child; otherwi&s;e it will corrupt the little heart, which it was de&s;igned to fortify. Things commit|ted to children in confidence, which are in their nature a &s;trong temptation, will only teach them artful eva&s;ions; for they will comply with the temptation, and then rack their invention to prevent the di&s;|covery, or to apologize for the tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ion.
<PB N="198" REF="022570_0197_0FB9989E97E9F6A8">
A child mu&s;t be trained to fidelity by &s;low and gentle &s;teps; and by a habit of being faithful in trifling concerns when young, it will be able to keep a &s;ecret; or be faithful to any tru&s;t, at &s;even or eight years old, which one of fourteen would betray, who had never been accu&s;tomed to confidence. Let the fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ion to a child be &s;mall, and of &s;uch a nature as may ea&s;ily be kept: approve the faith|fulne&s;s, and encourage it by &s;uitable re|wards: increa&s;e by degrees, the tru&s;t; and let the accompli&s;hment of it always be commended, and rewarded with &s;till great|er confidence.</P>
<P>AT a breach of tru&s;t, in either of the children, Mrs. Bloom&s;grove expre&s;&s;es much &s;urpri&s;e and indignation: &s;he de|clines tru&s;ting the faithle&s;s child again, until, by a due cour&s;e of di&s;cipline, it is &s;ufficiently humbled; but takes care not to mortify it too long. She lets the de|linquent &s;ee that &s;he &s;till confides in its re&s;olution and integrity. She appears to forget the former failure; but keeps it
<PB N="199" REF="022570_0198_0FB998A0847F7958">
alive in the child's mind, by more fre|quently calling it to account, without any apparent concern about its fidelity. When, by repeated trial, the habit of fidelity is well fixed, and a good degree of &s;elf command acquired, you may ven|ture almo&s;t any thing in &s;uch hands. It is proper to approve and appear highly plea&s;ed with the good conduct of child|ren, e&s;pecially their fidelity; but not to prai&s;e them too highly, becau&s;e it is an act of indi&s;pen&s;able obligation; and if too much prai&s;ed, the child may become more eager after applau&s;e, than de&s;irous of meriting e&s;teem and approbation; to the plea&s;ures of which they &s;hould be early accu&s;tomed.</P>
<P>OSANDER, at the age of five, was al|lowed to go into the garden, and pick up the cherries which had fallen, provided he meddled not with the white currants; and &s;ometimes he was &s;ent to gather a few of both, but charged not to eat any of either, until the gentleman who had called to &s;ee his papa was refre&s;hed. Being one day
<PB N="200" REF="022570_0199_0FB99445B5C7B728">
detected in tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the conditions, he was not &s;uffered to go into the garden all that day, nor to eat any fruit from it. At eight years old, he was intru&s;ted with a &s;mall &s;um of money, which he was told to keep, until a per&s;on to whom it was due, &s;hould call for it, and it was enjoined upon him to remember, that this confi|dence was placed in him, becau&s;e he had been hone&s;t in other ca&s;es, and it was not doubted but he would be &s;o in the pre&s;ent. The money was accordingly delivered up, at call, in about five days: greater &s;ums were afterwards committed to his care, and continued a longer time; until he might be intru&s;ted with any &s;um. When he goes abroad, the hour is given him for returning; if he abu&s;es the liberty he en|joys, it is taken from him for a time.</P>
<P>ROZELLA was permitted to go to her mamma's clo&s;et as &s;oon as &s;he was big enough to turn a key. She is told to take a piece of ru&s;k for her&s;elf, and to bring the chee&s;ecakes for the company; &s;he is faithful; but &s;he has been accu&s;tomed to

this re&s;traint by being tried in &s;maller things. At eight years old &s;he never thought of touching any forbidden fruit. Indeed, &s;he appears to prefer her mam|ma's approbation to every other plea&s;ure. Girls are holden much more &s;trongly by tho&s;e ties than boys, if we may judge by compari&s;on between the&s;e two; for O|&s;ander more frequently betrays the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him, than his &s;i&s;ter, tho it is a rare thing in either of them. The prin|ciple being early implanted, and the habits of fidelity being cheri&s;hed with great care, they were never &s;haken afterwards. Fan|ny improved by her care of Rozella, who was committed to her as a valuable de|po&s;it. The care of Rozella's clothes was given to her; &s;ometimes &s;he was directed to in&s;truct her in reading and work; fre|quently, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in dre&s;&s;ing and undre&s;&s;|ing. The vulgar ob&s;ervation, that wo|men are not able to keep a &s;ecret, has no foundation in nature; but mu&s;t be whol|ly a&s;cribed to their not being inured to it when young. They are naturally volu|ble,

have a &s;prightly imagination, and an ea&s;y flow of words: for the &s;ake of exer|ci&s;ing &s;uch agreeable talents, which they find command attention, they may inad|vertently divulge a &s;ecret. But if early accu&s;tomed to re&s;traint, and to the habit of making their mind the &s;ecure depo&s;it of a &s;ecret, there can be no doubt that it might be as perfectly &s;afe with them, as with our &s;ex.</P>

<P>CURIOSITY is that propen&s;ity to acquire knowledge, which leads children to inquire the names, properties, and re|lations of things; to refer appearances to cau&s;es; to &s;ort ideas, and di&s;tingui&s;h truth. This de&s;ire of knowledge operates power|fully in children, and is a mo&s;t u&s;eful en|gine of improvement. To &s;timulate and direct this affection, "which &s;eems to be created by the affinity of external objects
<PB N="203" REF="022570_0202_0FB9944F790C6E60">
and the &s;en&s;es affected by them," is an early and nece&s;&s;ary branch of education. It was, therefore, a maxim with the&s;e pa|rents to indulge their children in a&s;king que&s;tions for information; and to en|courage the exertion of this faculty by proper an&s;wers. To check the&s;e inquir|ies by &s;everity, or pervert them by fal&s;e, or eva&s;ive an&s;wers, would be to &s;tint a natural plant, which requires culture in order to bring it to perfection. Child|ren &s;hould be an&s;wered according to their capacity; nor &s;hould their ardor to be|come acquainted with things be damped, by laughing at their &s;imple que&s;tions. This would di&s;courage them from a&s;king again, le&s;t their que&s;tion &s;hould be an im|proper one. By kindly attending to their que&s;tions, and giving them plain intelli|gible an&s;wers, their minds will be con&s;tant|ly enlarging; the an&s;wer to one que&s;tion will &s;ugge&s;t to them another, and help their invention; at the &s;ame time it will add to their &s;tock of knowledge.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="022570_0203_0FB994541E5F92E0">BY neglecting this means of informa|tion, they will be encouraged in negli|gence and inattention. By receiving eva&s;ive or deceitful an&s;wers, to get rid of the trouble of giving them the informa|tion they &s;eek, art, di&s;&s;imulation, and fal&s;ehood will be cheri&s;hed. The great curio&s;ity of children appears in their fond|ne&s;s for &s;tories; and the u&s;e which may be made of this appetite, appears from the deep impre&s;&s;ions which idle and ground|le&s;s &s;tories of gho&s;ts and apparitions, make on the mind. Impre&s;&s;ions favorable to virtue may be made with equal ea&s;e, by familiar &s;tories founded on fact, and &s;uit|ed to promote any of the virtues. Tho&s;e pictures of real characters; of virtues to be imitated, and vices to be avoided, are to be viewed as the be&s;t &s;ources of in&s;truc|tion and entertainment to children.</P>
<P>MRS. Bloom&s;grove u&s;ed to &s;elect a num|ber of the mo&s;t &s;triking pictures of vir|tue and vice from the &s;acred hi&s;tory, which &s;he dre&s;&s;ed up in language &s;uited to the capacities of the children: the&s;e,
<PB N="205" REF="022570_0204_0FB9945584DF0A30">
they committed to memory and repeated to her, both for le&s;&s;ons of virtue, and for the &s;ake of improvement in the art of &s;peaking. In this &s;he imitated Cornelia, the mother of the Roman Gracchi, who owed to her in&s;truction that elocution by which the greate&s;t effects were produced.</P>
<P>AT the age of twelve, O&s;ander could not conceive of a greater plea&s;ure, or en|tertainment, than to hear his mamma re|late the hi&s;tory of Jo&s;eph with its various circum&s;tances. While the little bo&s;om of Rozella heaves with grief for his fate, and the falling tear bedews her ro&s;y cheek; O&s;ander's heart &s;wells with indignation at the cruelty of his brothers, and melts at the generous treatment he afterwards &s;hewed them when in di&s;tre&s;s; and Fan|ny's gentle &s;pirit cannot withhold the tear of &s;ympathy on the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>BY this &s;ingle &s;tory, the love of benev|olence, ju&s;tice, and fraternal kindne&s;s; and indignation again&s;t their oppo&s;ites, are awakened in every brea&s;t. A de&s;ire to imitate the one and avoid the other,
<PB N="206" REF="022570_0205_0FB9945C9DDBC4B0">
glows in their hearts, while the relation goes on. Accu&s;tomed to have tho&s;e pa&s;|&s;ions excited by &s;uch pictures pre&s;ented to the mind, they became fixed and per|manent qualities. I know many mothers who take great pains to in&s;truct their children in the knowledge of the &s;crip|tures, and to impre&s;s their minds with a reverence for them, by &s;imilar methods. By the&s;e means they are pre&s;ented with the be&s;t models of virtue; which is al|ways a plea&s;ing mode of in&s;truction, and excites at the &s;ame time a love of imita|tion: and as long as the curio&s;ity is grat|ified, in&s;truction will go on with rapidity, and the heart will be beguiled to virtue, and the affections directed to their proper objects.</P>

<P>"IN the nature of &s;ome individuals, &s;ays Lord Kaimes, there is a di&s;po&s;ition to cruelty. Strong &s;ymptoms of it appear
<PB N="207" REF="022570_0206_0FB9945E5FB55710">
in childhood, during which period there is nothing hid. It is not uncommon in a child, after care&s;&s;ing its favorite puppy, to kick and beat it; or after &s;troking a &s;par|row, to pull off its head. I have &s;een a little girl, after &s;pending hours in dre&s;&s;ing her doll, throw it out of the window in a &s;udden fit. This di&s;ea&s;e is not ea&s;ily cured, becau&s;e, like the king's evil, it is kept &s;ecret: I know of no cure &s;o effect|ual, as to inure a child of this temper, to objects of pity and concern. Such ob|jects frequently pre&s;ented, and at proper times, may give a turn to the di&s;temper, and make it yield to humanity. Such fits of cruelty, however, are far from being general. There are many children, who having no malice in their compo&s;ition, are invariably kind to their favorites, and charitable to per&s;ons in want."</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING this appearance of cruelty in &s;ome children, and a &s;mall degree of it in mo&s;t, yet &s;ympathy is a native affection, which, for its &s;trength, may be ranked with the fir&s;t cla&s;s of hu|man
<PB N="208" REF="022570_0207_0FB9945F3669BFA0">
propen&s;ities. It is not only a &s;trong but a plea&s;ing affection, and requires to be cheri&s;hed with particular attention; for without this care it may be de&s;troyed. There is in children a curio&s;ity to &s;ee an|imals &s;lain, and a plea&s;ure in triumphing over their agonies, which has a mo&s;t dan|gerous tendency upon the fine feelings of human nature. The &s;pa&s;ms which are brought on the expiring animal, by the approach of death, afford them &s;port, not becau&s;e it feels pain, but becau&s;e of the novelty of the &s;cene. They have no idea of tho&s;e emotions having any connexion with pain. They &s;ee the relentle&s;s exe|cutioner put his knife to the throat of an innocent lamb with as little concern, as a lady does her needle into a piece of gauze; and have, when quite young, no more idea of pain in one ca&s;e than in the other. Horrid le&s;&s;on of cruelty to the young and tender mind! How ea&s;y and natural for children to transfer this into their own practice by tormenting the lit|tle animals and in&s;ects, which fall into
<PB N="209" REF="022570_0208_0FB99460B5C6EFF0">
their hands? This, by a habit of hardi|ne&s;s, becomes cruelty to their mates.</P>
<P>THE cruel di&s;po&s;ition, or dete&s;table character, of Domitian, had been formed by his favorite amu&s;ement of killing flies.</P>
<P>SOME have &s;uppo&s;ed that cruelty is the effect of the u&s;e of fle&s;h. This &s;entiment is founded on a &s;uppo&s;ed difference, in this re&s;pect, between tho&s;e nations who u&s;e it, and tho&s;e who do not.</P>
<P>THE u&s;e of this &s;ub&s;tantial diet may probably be a&s;&s;igned as the phy&s;ical cau&s;e of &s;trength and robu&s;tne&s;s of con&s;titution; but this is not incompatible with tender|ne&s;s. The cu&s;tom of &s;uffering children to &s;ee tho&s;e &s;cen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, when very young; their hearing frequent conver&s;ation on the &s;ubject of blood&s;hed, and &s;oon reading hi&s;tories of war and carnage; and finding the greate&s;t murderers of mankind have more renown than their greate&s;t benefac|tors, will furni&s;h a &s;ufficient rea&s;on, with|out &s;eeking for any phy&s;ical cau&s;e, I may venture to affirm, that &s;ympathy is natural to man; and that cruelty is, in general, a
<PB N="210" REF="022570_0209_0FB99466E6CA6F68">
di&s;po&s;ition created by improper manage|ment, derived from example, and con|firmed by habit.</P>
<P>OSANDER, when a child, was kept from tho&s;e &s;ights which have a tendency to brutalize the mind. He was not &s;uffered to read the hi&s;tory of battles, where the agreeablene&s;s of the narrative would ren|der the &s;laughter a plea&s;ing &s;cene; and, as hi&s;tory is principally occupied with &s;uch relations, he read very little of it, until his judgment was con&s;iderably ma|tured. By &s;ometimes &s;eeing objects of human di&s;tre&s;s, and frequently making the little excur&s;ions already mentioned among the poor of the neighborhood, his &s;ym|pathy was kept alive and rendered more &s;en&s;ible. Rozella, who was all &s;ympathy, at about &s;even years of age, was riding with her mamma, and unfortunately they pa&s;&s;ed a farmer's yard, ju&s;t as he was in the act of killing a lamb. Affrighted at the &s;ight, &s;he &s;aid, "Mamma, what is that man doing with that poor little lamb?" "He is going, my dear, to kill it, to eat, I
<PB N="211" REF="022570_0210_0FB99468F3DBE4E8">
&s;uppo&s;e." The reply was rather inad|vertent; for till now Rozella had never connected the idea of eating meat with the de&s;truction of the animal. It was the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation all the way home, and it was a long time before the impre&s;|&s;ion was &s;o effaced, as that &s;he would ta&s;te it again.</P>
<P>SHE was permitted to have a bird, or a &s;quirrel; and her brother to have a dog; only on condition that they would take care of them, and not let them &s;uffer for want, or by abu&s;e. When they failed in a proper care and tenderne&s;s for them, they were reproved for being &s;o unkind, and the animal taken away. They were never &s;uffered to kill in&s;ects for &s;port. They did not, however, carry humanity to the ridiculous extreme, which is relat|ed of Bellarmine, a Romi&s;h &s;aint, who is &s;aid patiently to have &s;uffered fleas and other vermin to prey upon him; &s;aying, "We &s;hall have a heaven to reward us for our &s;ufferings; but the&s;e poor crea|tures have only the enjoyment of the pre&s;|ent

life." In&s;ects which u&s;ually &s;uffer death, for their pre&s;umption in invading the hou&s;es of mortals, their mamma taught them to &s;weep out at the door, &s;aying, "It is an innocent creature, my dear, do not hurt it; is not the world wide enough for you both?"</P>
<P>BY the&s;e le&s;&s;ons, joined to he own ex|ample, &s;he taught them tenderne&s;s towards every thing that has life. That tender feeling towards other's &s;ufferings, which, in its &s;everal degrees, extends it&s;elf to other animals of creation, from our fellow creature to the lowe&s;t reptile, is a quality infinitely &s;uperior to all the embelli&s;h|ments of the mo&s;t refined education. The knowledge and practice of this is a mo&s;t u&s;eful part of dome&s;tic in&s;truction.</P>
<P>IT has been remarked, I believe with great propriety, that young people, early corrupted, and addicted to debauchery, are inhuman and cruel. The heat of their con&s;titution renders them impatient, vin|dictive, and impetuous: their imagination, engro&s;&s;ed by one particular object, rejects
<PB N="213" REF="022570_0212_0FB9946E848F9E28">
every other: they have neither tender|ne&s;s nor pity, and would &s;acrifice father, mother, and all the world, to the mo&s;t trifling gratification. On the contrary, a youth, educated in &s;implicity and inno|cence, is inclined to the tender pa&s;&s;ions by the fir&s;t impul&s;e of nature. His &s;ympa|thetic heart feels the &s;ufferings of his fel|low creatures: it leaps with joy at the unexpected &s;ight of a beloved companion.

Compa&s;&s;ion, clemency, and genero&s;ity, mark the &s;en&s;ibility of his heart, and pro|duce the happie&s;t effects in &s;ociety.</P>
<P>THE early regulation of this affection in the youthful brea&s;t of our little ma&s;ter and his &s;i&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, greatly facilitated that of another, equally important in dome&s;tic education, and which comes next in cour&s;e.</P>

<P>IT was a maxim with the&s;e worthy parents, that in every &s;tage of dome&s;tic education, children &s;hould be di&s;ciplined to re&s;train their appetites and de&s;ires. They thought, therefore, that they could not begin too early to check the de&s;ire which children have for gewgaws and toys, and to accu&s;tom them to re&s;traint and &s;elf command. In order to do this effectually, it is nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve that lively &s;en&s;ibility, and tho&s;e &s;ympathetic affections, of which I &s;pake, in my la&s;t. The heart in which this delicate &s;en&s;e is kept alive, will not be unyielding to re|&s;traint and &s;elf denial.</P>
<P>IN a world like this, and with pa&s;&s;ions like ours, what can be more u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary, than the power of re&s;training our appetites? The objects of &s;en&s;e which &s;urround us on every &s;ide, are &s;uited to awaken de&s;ire, and de&s;ire pu&s;hes us on to gratification; but this cannot always be

attained. The pre&s;ervation of health and of tranquillity often forbid it, when in our power. And this is our &s;ituation through|out life. Not a day pa&s;&s;es, but we find occa&s;ion to abridge our de&s;ires, to deny our&s;elves &s;ome gratification, and &s;ubmit to &s;ome inconvenience. To acquire an early habit of re&s;traint mu&s;t, therefore, be u&s;eful to us, as long as we are conver&s;ant with tho&s;e objects.</P>
<P>THIS command over our&s;elves will be|come ea&s;y by cu&s;tom; and it will not be difficult to graft it on children, where proper authority has been &s;upported. Parents are the natural guardians of their children, and their rea&s;on &s;hould be em|ployed to control, re&s;train, and direct the appetites of childhood. Impelled by the&s;e, while rea&s;on, like the body, is feeble, they would gratify them to their injury, and by a habit of indulgence, would grow up with impetuous and dangerous propen&s;i|ties. Re&s;traint &s;hould never be laid merely to di&s;play authority, but from the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e, and to habituate the child to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>

Re&s;traints, where they are indi&s;pen&s;able, &s;hould be &s;o laid, as rather to call off the mind from the ob|ject, than to prohibit the enjoyment. To maintain that entire control over the ap|petites of children, which is the parent's prerogative, &s;o as not to induce di&s;&s;imula|tion on the one hand, nor di&s;affection on the other, is a critical point. When the parent, or the preceptor, becomes a ty|rant, and the child a &s;lave, there is an end of all education.</P>
<P>IN laying re&s;traints, therefore, &s;ome regard mu&s;t be had to the particular con|&s;titution of children. Tho&s;e of a feeble, or &s;lender make, require more indulgence, in their food, exerci&s;e, and in the puni&s;h|ments which are found nece&s;&s;ary, than tho&s;e of a firm, robu&s;t habit of body. To pamper the&s;e with delicacies, merely to gratify appetite; to excu&s;e them from ex|erci&s;e, le&s;t it &s;hould fatigue them; or, to

In both the&s;e re&s;pects, many a fine child&punc; has been ruined by imprudent manage|ment. In&s;tances are not wanting to &s;hew, that the &s;ame effect may be produced from an oppo&s;ite cau&s;e. Roughne&s;s and &s;e|verity with tho&s;e, who&s;e languid &s;pirits and feeble habit required that they &s;hould be fo&s;tered in the arms of pity and in|dulgence, have &s;o depre&s;&s;ed them, that they could not gain their proper rank in &s;ociety, nor hold up their heads in the face of the world.</P>
<P>THESE are extremes equally dangerous, and which require great caution; for that which would be lenity to the former, may be &s;everity with the latter. Parents, &s;ometimes, &s;hew great partiality, among their children, on account of their out|ward form. While the beauty of the one procures a fond indulgence, the deformity, or even the plainne&s;s, of another, expo&s;es to &s;lights and neglect. This is a &s;pecies of
<PB N="218" REF="022570_0217_0FB9947AF6635700">
conduct no le&s;s cruel in the parent, than de&s;tructive to the children. In one it cheri&s;hes the &s;eeds of vanity and in&s;olence; in the other, of melancholy and di&s;cour|agement. An oppo&s;ite treatment ought to be adopted, by &s;hewing peculiar ten|derne&s;s to the unfortunate.</P>
<P>IF children have natural defects, no pains &s;hould be taken to &s;ecrete them. Such attempts would be teaching them di&s;&s;imulation, and would often expo&s;e them to the painful jokes of their mates, and the &s;neerings of others.

His friend, the landlord, &s;eeing him in his wai&s;tcoat at that work, &s;ays, "Ble&s;s me, General, what are you doing here?" "I am paying for my bad looks," replied the General."</P>

<P>I WILL now return to the re&s;traints and &s;elf command, to which children &s;hould be early accu&s;tomed, and to the gentle manner in which O&s;ander and Ro|zella were taught this le&s;&s;on. All rea&s;on|able de&s;ires were gratified with cheerful|ne&s;s; unrea&s;onable or improper reque&s;ts were denied without any apparent con|cern. Children, when very young, will perceive the parent's unea&s;ine&s;s, if refu&s;ed with doubt and he&s;itation; and will de|rive encouragement from that &s;tate of &s;u&s;|pen&s;e, to renew their reque&s;t. Children have great &s;agacity in this re&s;pect. They watch the parent's eyes, and ob&s;erve the tone of voice; and fail not to make the be&s;t advantage of any irre&s;olution which they di&s;cover. If the reque&s;t is of &s;uch a nature, that it cannot be granted, they re|fu&s;e it with a plea&s;ant, but firm tone. They &s;ay, in a &s;edate manner, without any apparent concern, "You a&s;k, my dear, for that which is not proper: you

cannot have it." The child is no longer re&s;tle&s;s, when convinced of the impo&s;&s;ibil|ity of obtaining the object of its wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>I WAS pre&s;ent, &s;everal years ago, at the following &s;cene&mdash;An elderly lady had the charge of a boy about twelve years old. He was a very active, enterpri&s;ing lad, and glowed with ambition. A number of youth, older than him&s;elf, were going to have a riding match: they invited him to be of their party. He applied for per|mi&s;&s;ion, and was refu&s;ed. He urged the reque&s;t with a variety of arguments, and they were all obviated by &s;tronger rea&s;ons. He &s;till pur&s;ued the &s;uit, with increa&s;ing vehemence. The danger of it was repre|&s;ented to him: he was told that a young lad had been thrown from a hor&s;e, and had broken his arm. It all availed nothing, but to make him the more earne&s;t. He was then po&s;itively prohibited &s;aying another word about it. The interdict was &s;o peremptory, that it left no hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, and he went away as apparently &s;atisfied as if his reque&s;t had been granted.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="022570_0221_0FB99486B081B980">TO clip the wings of fancy, and teach the romantic de&s;ires to &s;ubmit to the rea|&s;on of others in childhood, is a di&s;cipline mo&s;t u&s;eful thro every &s;tage of life. It prepares the child to be put under the conduct of its own rea&s;on, to bear cro&s;&s;es and di&s;appointments, and to &s;ubmit to the authority of con&s;cience and of the magi&s;|trate. A young per&s;on, accu&s;tomed from infancy to re&s;traint, will find no great dif|ficulty in &s;ubmitting to the dictates of his own con&s;cience; and, by a habit of re&s;i&s;t|ing his de&s;ires, will be able to evade the force of any temptation. But if, as Mr. Locke ob&s;erves, "the child mu&s;t have grapes, or &s;ugar plumbs, when he has a mind to them; when grown up, mu&s;t he not have his de&s;ires &s;atisfied too, to what|ever vices they may lead him? He who is not u&s;ed to &s;ubmit his will to the rea|&s;on of others, while he is young, will &s;carce hearken, or &s;ubmit to his own rea&s;on, when he is of an age to make u&s;e of it."</P>
<P>IT is a mi&s;take, fatal to education, which many have made, that children are
<PB N="223" REF="022570_0222_0FB99487B442F3B8">
happy in proportion as their wi&s;hes are gratified. I believe the rever&s;e to be true. We find, that, in manhood, an unre&s;train|ed gratification of appetites is &s;o far from &s;atisfying, that they increa&s;e and gather &s;trength by indulgence. "If, &s;aid Seneca, you &s;eek to make one rich, &s;tudy not to increa&s;e his &s;tores, but to dimini&s;h his de|&s;ires." To Alexander, the fruit of all his conque&s;ts was tears; and whoever goes about to gratify intemperate wi&s;hes, will labor to as little purpo&s;e, as he who &s;hould attempt to fill a &s;ieve with water. If you would &s;atisfy the appetites of children, regulate them by your rea&s;on, and direct them by your prudence, allowing for their age. They acquire a habit of long|ing after trifles, by fal&s;e indulgence. Ma|ny e&s;tates have been &s;quandered away on appetites, which were created by early indulgence; and become head&s;trong, by repeated gratification. To indulge irreg|ular fancies, in creatures de&s;titute of rea|&s;on, mu&s;t be de&s;tructive to &s;elf command; without which there can be no virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="022570_0223_0FB9948A19D08D10">I ONCE was acquainted with a lady, who&s;e parents had never laid any re&s;traint on her pa&s;&s;ions or appetites in child|hood, but yielded to every idle fancy, until, on a bright evening, &s;he took it in|to her head to cry for the moon. The only rea&s;on that it was not granted, was the want of power in the parents. This fact they acknowledged after &s;he grew up; and they had rea&s;on to regret their folly on account of the peevi&s;h, re&s;tle&s;s di&s;po&s;i|tion which it had created; and &s;he found this world a very inho&s;pitable region for one, who could not &s;ubmit to the condi|tions of living in it; for meeting perpet|ually with objects to excite the fancy, and create de&s;ires, without the power of grat|ifying them all, or of bearing the di&s;ap|pointment of any, you will ea&s;ily believe &s;he could not be very happy.</P>
<P>MRS. Bloom&s;grove was an affectionate mother, but not le&s;s faithful than affec|tionate. She &s;hewed the mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive tenderne&s;s to her children when &s;ick; and ever indulged their de&s;ires in health, as far
<PB N="225" REF="022570_0224_0FB9948C344D9660">
as, in her judgment, was proper. They were allowed to come to their parents with a re&s;pectful freedom, to make known their wants; but not to expre&s;s their idle or extravagant wi&s;hes. O&s;ander does not, like ma&s;ter Dickie, "cry to ride up to table on the &s;irloin of roa&s;t beef." Nor does Rozella cry for the moon; but they a&s;k for any thing they need without re|&s;erve. Before they could &s;peak, they were taught, by &s;igns expre&s;&s;ive of di&s;approba|tion, to cea&s;e crying, or craving any thing which they might not have: they were di&s;ciplined to re&s;traint when large enough to &s;it at table, and to &s;ee a thing without wanting it. They were never hungry be|cau&s;e they &s;aw others eat, as is common with children of ungoverned appetites. At a plentiful table, like Mr. Bloom&s;|grove's, their palates might ea&s;ily have been made re&s;tle&s;s and in&s;atiable; but ac|cu&s;tomed, as they were, to re&s;traint, they never wanted &s;omething el&s;e in preference to what was given them. They generally dined on one di&s;h, and appeared perfectly
<PB N="226" REF="022570_0225_0FB9948DB45E1508">
&s;atisfied at relinqui&s;hing all the re&s;t. If they &s;aw, at any time, children furni&s;hed with toys and gewgaws, and expre&s;&s;ed any de&s;ire for the like, their parents would &s;peak to them with great indifference of tho&s;e things, as of no kind of value. The&s;e fine things, &s;aid Mrs. Bloom&s;grove, to her little daughter, may do for children who have no better qualities; but what a figure does a girl of twelve or thirteen years old make with fine feathers on a head that is de&s;titute of knowledge? If you acquire the latter, you have le&s;s need of the former; and be&s;ides, if children do not behave well, their finery only makes them appear the wor&s;e; and tho&s;e who are good will not need gay things to recommend them: every body will e&s;teem and love them without tho&s;e ornaments.</P>
<P>I CANNOT clo&s;e this, without ob&s;erving to you the va&s;t advantage to be derived from this habitual re&s;traint, in point of government. Accu&s;tomed to govern them&s;elves, correction becomes a &s;trange work; each yields to order without per|ceiving

<P>IT is with families, as with &s;tates; they have been too bu&s;y with laws, and too remi&s;s in education. They contrive methods to puni&s;h, not to prevent crimes. But the Bloom&s;grove family affords an exception from this general ob&s;ervation. The nece&s;&s;ity of puni&s;hment was almo&s;t precluded by their mode of dome&s;tic man|agement. We cannot, therefore, draw many examples from it on this head.</P>
<P>I AM convinced, from the &s;ucce&s;s of their dome&s;tic di&s;cipline, that the u&s;ual mode of government &s;hould be inverted; and the pa&s;&s;ion, fear, which is commonly the fir&s;t, become the la&s;t pa&s;&s;ion addre&s;&s;ed by parental authority. Like the ULTIMA
<PB N="228" REF="022570_0227_0FB99496B433A9A8">
RATIO REGUM, this &s;hould be the la&s;t rea&s;oning of parents.</P>
<P>ON this &s;ubject my friend &mdash; writes me, that, from his own experience, he has found it as nece&s;&s;ary to reward his child|ren for good, as to puni&s;h them for bad actions; that rewards are of immen&s;e con|&s;equence in &s;timulating them to indu&s;try, virtue, and good manners, "I was led," &s;ays he, "to adopt this practice, by con|templating the principles of action, in men, by which God governs his rational creatures." He goes on to explode cor|poral corrections, and to recommend &s;olitude, with darkne&s;s, as the mo&s;t ef|fectual puni&s;hment that can be contrived for them. This he has u&s;ed &s;ucce&s;sfully in his own family for many years. The duration of the confinement, and the di&s;|agreeable circum&s;tances that are connect|ed with it, are proportioned to the faults which are committed.</P>
<P>TOO much, he adds, cannot be &s;aid in favor of &s;olitude, as the means of reforma|tion, which &s;hould be the only end of all
<PB N="229" REF="022570_0228_0FB99499CC783320">
puni&s;hment. Men are wicked only from inattention, or want of thinking. In&s;pir|ation, therefore, calls on them to "CON|SIDER THEIR WAYS."</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t &s;evere puni&s;hments, which human laws inflict, are light, compared with that of letting a man's con&s;cience loo&s;e upon him&s;elf, in &s;olitude. Com|pany, conver&s;ation, and even bu&s;ine&s;s, are the opiates of the &s;pirit of God in the hu|man heart. For this rea&s;on, a bad man &s;hould be left in confinement for &s;ome|time, without any thing to employ his hands about. Every thought &s;hould re|coil wholly upon him&s;elf; and he cannot be delivered to a more &s;evere tormentor.</P>
<P>"THERE is, &s;ays Lord Kaimes, no branch of di&s;cipline that ought to be ex|erci&s;ed with more caution, than the di&s;tri|bution of rewards and puni&s;hments. If money, a fine coat, or what plea&s;es the palate, be the reward promi&s;ed; is it not the ready way to foment avarice, vanity, or luxury? Prai&s;e is an efficacious reward, or which even children are fond; and

when properly applied, it never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ils to produce good behavior. Puni&s;hment requires &s;till more caution; as it ought to be proportioned to the temper of the pupil, as well as to the nature of the fault. I cannot recollect a fault that req<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es corporal puni&s;hment but ob&s;tinacy, which is inherent in &s;ome per&s;ons. Lying, I think, may be corrected, or rather pre|vented, by proper management: my rea|&s;on for it is, that it is not inherent in our nature, but forced upon a child by har&s;h treatment. Any fault, except ob&s;tinacy, that a child can be guilty of, may be re|pre&s;&s;ed by &s;hame and di&s;grace, which &s;ink deep into the heart of children, as well as of men and women. To keep children in awe, by the fear of corporal puni&s;hment, will put them upon hiding their faults, in&s;tead of correcting them."</P>
<P>IT was a maxim with Solomon, that "he who &s;pares the rod ruins his child." Government mu&s;t at all hazards be &s;up|ported; for no con&s;equences are to be feared, even from the &s;evere&s;t exerci&s;e of

<P>I BELIEVE it is a maxim with phy|&s;icians, that preventives are the be&s;t ex|pedients. If you can, by any means, ac|cu&s;tom your children to acknowledge their faults, it will le&s;&s;en their number, and it will preclude the nece&s;&s;ity of pun|i&s;hment. This is the only ca&s;e in which I think auricular confe&s;&s;ion meritorious. This, tho a difficult part of education, is an important one, and may be effected by beginning early with them, and letting them find that a candid acknowledgement always procures ab&s;olution. The fine&s;t
<PB N="232" REF="022570_0231_0FB994A0977A6428">
&s;en&s;ibility &s;hould be cheri&s;hed in the young heart, with regard to right and wrong. This can be effected only by ap|pearing hurt and grieved, not angry, at their faults. If you are angry with a child for its faults and rave at it, you ex|cite the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion in the child; and the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion in oppo&s;ite bodies, like the repellent power in matter, drives them from each other. But &s;often the heart by grief, and you will attract the child to you; and its faults will become &s;uch bur|dens, that it cannot retain them. Rozel|la broke a china &s;aucer of her mamma's be&s;t &s;et: the accident was known only to her&s;elf; &s;he hid the pieces to prevent di&s;|covery, but felt very unhappy, and could find no relief but in a frank confe&s;&s;ion. Her mamma &s;ays, "Your fault, my dear, lay in attempting to conceal what you had done; but your confe&s;&s;ing it of your own ac|cord, de&s;erves more prai&s;e, than either the breaking, or concealing it de&s;erves blame." A frown, on this occa&s;ion, would have been death to tho&s;e tender and generous

<P>WHAT, but har&s;hne&s;s and &s;everity, can ob&s;truct the confidence which affection to parents naturally leads children to place in them? Will children confe&s;s their faults, unle&s;s they can feel a&s;&s;ured that an hone<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> confe&s;&s;ion will &s;ave them from puni&s;h|ment? Will they not rather di&s;&s;emble, and do any thing to avoid a di&s;covery, which involves in it the con&s;equences of a crime?</P>
<P>AMONG the various ways of training the children to confe&s;s their faults, the following appeared to Mrs. Bloom&s;grove to be the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful. Returning home, after a vi&s;it of a week or two, &s;he put each of her children to &s;ay, what good had been done by the other; and what ill it&s;elf had done. The former endeared them to one another, the latter re&s;trained them from committing faults. The&s;e ar|ticles &s;he made the &s;ubject of conver&s;a|tion; and endeavored to ripen their un|der&s;tanding, by &s;hewing them what was right and what was wrong in their conduct.
<PB N="234" REF="022570_0233_0FB994A43B537830">
But &s;he was careful to provide a tru&s;ty per&s;on, to inform her of any fault that had been concealed. In that ca&s;e &s;he would &s;ay to the child, "Surely, my dear, you have a bad memory, did you not do &s;o and &s;o?" The child thinks it in vain to attempt hiding of it; for, "Mamma knows every thing." Stern authority is &s;uitable only for the ob&s;tinate and petu|lant; but advice and remon&s;trance will be a better corrector of other faults. Children may often be put into a way of correcting their own faults, or of volun|tarily confe&s;&s;ing them. "A young girl, aged eleven, having accidentally hurt her finger, &s;hewed &s;ome degree of impatience. The governe&s;s, having in vain endeavor|ed to &s;hame her out of it, left the room with a reproachful look, &s;aying, that &s;he could not bear to &s;ee &s;uch concern for a trifle. In le&s;s than an hour, &s;he received a billet from her pupil, acknowledging her mi&s;behavior, and intreating to be forgiv|en. The young lady owes much of this pliancy of temper to an affectionate moth|er,

who&s;e high &s;tation has not made her relax from attending to the education of her children, with a degree of prudence and &s;agacity, that would give lu&s;tre to a per&s;on much inferior in rank."</P>
<P>STUBBORNNESS will be &s;carcely known, where a proper authority has been main|tained from the beginning; but will &s;oon appear in &s;ome children, where that is not exerci&s;ed. "Mr. Locke mentions a lady who&s;e daughter was nur&s;ed in the coun|try. She found the child &s;o &s;tubborn, as to be forced to whip it eight times, before it was &s;ubdued.

<P>THE evening was &s;erene, and in|vited to walk. The &s;weet fragrance of the blooming flowers embalm the air, in|&s;piring health. Plea&s;ures breathe thro the bending wood; exhale from the fair bo&s;om of the floods, and &s;well with the nightingale's melodious note, while Mr. and Mrs. Bloom&s;grove, accompanied by their children and Fanny, walk in the gravel way. The pale glimmering moon-beams,
<PB N="239" REF="022570_0238_0FB994B0DA8A4BD8">
&s;tealing thro the opening foliage, &s;oftened all their feelings. The &s;erenity of the &s;ky, the &s;oftne&s;s of the air, and the many glittering objects around, in&s;pired a placid cheerfulne&s;s, which opened the heart to the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible delight. A cir|cum&s;tance which added much to the plea&s;|ure of the evening was, they had all dined at Mr. Bloom&s;grove's father's that day, being the birth day of Rozella, who now commenced her thirteenth year.</P>
<P>HER grand papa and grand mamma were no le&s;s delighted with her &s;prightli|ne&s;s, her re&s;pectful and plea&s;ing manners, and the manly conduct of O&s;ander, than their parents. The union of three gen|erations in convivial entertainment, light|ened the heart of the aged, and taught them to bend to the manners of the young; while the&s;e, in turn, endeavored to repay &s;uch goodne&s;s by reverence and attention, united to &s;portive plea&s;ures. A day which renewed the age of &s;ixty in that of thirteen, could not be pa&s;&s;ed without the utmo&s;t enjoyment. I do not relate the
<PB N="240" REF="022570_0239_0FB994B1C40E1DD0">
circum&s;tance of their dining together as an uncommon thing; but this being the birth day of Rozella, which rai&s;ed her to A MISS IN HER TEENS, afforded peculiar plea&s;ure; and it drew forth from her grand mamma &s;ome &s;parkling touches of humor, for which &s;he had formerly been celebrated, and by which &s;he plea&s;antly conveyed in&s;truction to her grand child. The dinner was compo&s;ed of every thing good which the &s;ea&s;on afforded; was &s;erved up in an elegant &s;implicity of &s;tyle; and the day pa&s;&s;ed in great conviviality, and good humor. After returning home, they pa&s;&s;ed the evening in the gravel walk. Fanny makes her ob&s;ervations on the plea&s;ures of &s;ociety, and e&s;pecially on the enjoyment of family circles, where all is harmony and friend&s;hip. Rozella prat|tles about grand mamma's good puddings and pies, wonders if &s;he &s;hall ever look as old as grand mamma, and repeats many of her plea&s;ant and &s;en&s;ible &s;peeches. O|&s;ander wonders if grand papa ever read all the books in his library, and thinks that if
<PB N="241" REF="022570_0240_0FB994B3F4CDAF58">
he has, his head is like a full moon, which reflects its light every where. Fanny en|ters &s;piritedly into their chat, and gam|bols with them on the green. Plea&s;ure &s;parkles in the parents' eyes as they walk, and &s;ee the &s;portive mirth of their youth|ful family.</P>
<P>THE evening being clo&s;ed, they return to offer prai&s;es, on the dome&s;tic altar, to that Almighty Being who guards the dwellings of the ju&s;t, and is the friend of the faithful. Having committed them|&s;elves to the care of his providence, they retire to re&s;t with full confidence in his paternal protection. All is hu&s;h&mdash;a pro|found &s;ilence reigns thro the man&s;ion. Sweet, balmy &s;leep had cha&s;ed away the events of the pa&s;t, rendered them uncon|&s;cious of the pre&s;ent, and unapprehen&s;ive of the future. But, hark! A commi&s;|&s;ioned me&s;&s;enger arrives&mdash;a &s;udden and loud rap awakes the whole hou&s;e&mdash;Mr. Bloom&s;grove ha&s;tily ari&s;es; and, throw|ing up the window, inquires who is there. He is informed that a violent illne&s;s has

&s;eized his mother; that the phy&s;ician thinks her &s;ymptoms threatening, and that &s;he de&s;ires to &s;ee him and Mrs. Bloom&s;|grove as &s;oon as may be. They ha&s;ten to the hou&s;e, where fe&s;tivity had prevailed the day before, to di&s;charge the duties of filial piety.</P>
<P>IT will not be nece&s;&s;ary to relate the minute circum&s;tances that took place on this occa&s;ion, and the general alarm it &s;pread thro the family. Suffice it to &s;ay, that they lo&s;t no time to &s;ee &s;o worthy a parent. The violence of the di&s;order a|bated in the morning; when &s;he de&s;ired to &s;ee the children, and Fanny, whom &s;he numbered among them. They were im|mediately &s;ent for, and a deluge of tears &s;ucceeded their entrance into the room. The old lady recovered from the fir&s;t &s;hock, which the &s;ight of tho&s;e dear ob|jects gave, and was able to admini&s;ter the mo&s;t &s;alutary advice. She appeared per|fectly re&s;igned to the will of the &s;upreme di&s;po&s;er of events. She &s;pake of death with an unaffected firmne&s;s, as ca&s;t in the

<P>HOW intere&s;ting the &s;cene! the parent of a numerous progeny, with a countenance rendered &s;erene and venerable by piety and age, giving them her la&s;t advice, her part|ing ble&s;&s;ing; the children and de&s;cendants admini&s;tering the proper cordial to old age, by the tender hand of filial affection. Neither the native firmne&s;s of mind, nor the high rank in life which Mr. Bloom&s;|grove held, le&s;&s;ened his affection for a mother whom he had every rea&s;on to ven|erate; nor did he omit any attention in his power, to render the clo&s;ing &s;cene comfortable. In this he imitated the con|duct of Solomon, who, tho a KING, did not lo&s;e the re&s;pect of a child; but ro&s;e from his throne, and bowed him&s;elf, when his mother came to him with a reque&s;t. This &s;ickne&s;s gave them an opportunity to exhibit an example of filial piety, af|fection, and reverence, which made a

<P>THE di&s;order continued, with various &s;ymptoms, &s;everal days, until feeble na|ture became exhau&s;ted, and &s;he gently &s;unk down into &s;oft &s;lumbers; leaving to the young a &s;triking in&s;tance of the &s;erene evening, which &s;ucceeds the virtuous morning of life. Here was one of the mo&s;t beautiful and intere&s;ting &s;cenes you can conceive of! dutiful and affectionate children, &s;urrounding the dying bed of a parent with unfeigned grief; and with re&s;pectful mourning, following her re|mains to the grave; and recording in their faithful memories the debt of grati|tude they owed to parental care and love:

<P>A PLEASING melancholy for a while pervaded the hou&s;e, and ca&s;t in &s;oft|ening &s;hades the illu&s;trious qualities of its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. They failed not to improve the &s;orrowful incident to moral and relig|ious purpo&s;es. The &s;udden tran&s;ition from joy to &s;orrow; from health and fe&s;|tivity, to &s;ickne&s;s and death, afforded &s;cope for many an u&s;eful le&s;&s;on of in&s;truction. And as they had trained their children to &s;ubmit to the ills of life, &s;o they exhibited an example of it on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>HITHERTO education has been carried on more by phy&s;ical influence, than by the light of under&s;tanding in the pupil. The period is now arrived, in which rea|&s;on begins to unfold more lively colors, and will bear a more active part in the future management of the children. Placing our&s;elves on this boundary line between childhood and youth, we can look back and &s;urvey, at a &s;ingle glance, the progre&s;s of education in infancy and
<PB N="246" REF="022570_0245_0FB994C53A846478">
childhood; but looking forward thro the devious paths of youth, an infinite variety and boundle&s;s pro&s;pects open before us. To analyze this period of education, &s;o that each part may be di&s;tinctly viewed, and no one pa&s;s unnoticed, is not an ea&s;y ta&s;k. The daughter is to be trained in the line of her &s;ex, and prepared to ap|pear, to the be&s;t advantage, in the world, which will employ all the prudence and good &s;en&s;e of the mother. And the &s;on, to be brought forward in the higher branches of learning, and to be educated in &s;uch a manner, as will be&s;t prepare him for u&s;efulne&s;s and happine&s;s in life.</P>
<P>BUT you will recollect that dome&s;tic memoirs, and not a treati&s;e on &s;chool learning, is our object. However the latter may be neglected, that which be|longs to parents, and is properly of the dome&s;tic kind, is, perhaps, much more &s;o. In &s;chools we look for little el&s;e than the culture of the under&s;tanding; at home we are to look for the culture of the heart. If parents were as &s;olicitous to do
<PB N="247" REF="022570_0246_0FB994C6BA67C840">
their duty in this re&s;pect, as they are to have teachers of &s;chools do theirs, it would redound much to the honor of human nature, and the happine&s;s of their child|ren. But where the under&s;tanding has been improved to the greate&s;t degree of perfection, the cultivation of the heart has been &s;urpri&s;ingly neglected. Now is the &s;ea&s;on for the cultivation of both head and heart in our young pupils.</P>
<P>OSANDER was to have been &s;ent abroad to &s;chool about this time, in order to pre|pare him for a public education; but the event of his grand mamma's death detain|ed him beyond the intended period. In order to &s;upply the place of his &s;on, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, Mr. Bloom&s;grove invited a nephew, who had ju&s;t fini&s;hed his aca|demic &s;tudies, to re&s;ide at his hou&s;e. This nephew was a worthy youth, but had &s;uffered much by being &s;ent abroad too young. Science he had acquired; but very little attention had been paid to the regulation of the heart. Mr. Bloom&s;|grove &s;oon di&s;covered the di&s;ea&s;e and the
<PB N="248" REF="022570_0247_0FB994CA89E7B0B8">
cau&s;e of it. He &s;aw that his nephew had been under preceptors, who con&s;idered not the culture of the heart as any part of their bu&s;ine&s;s; and, tho furni&s;hed with grammar rules, yet moral principles, which are u&s;eful in every part and &s;tation of life, had not been in&s;tilled into his mind. This turned Mr. Bloom&s;grove's thoughts into a new channel with re&s;pect to his &s;on.</P>
<P>HE perceived that his nephew, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions were warm, but had a heart &s;u&s;|ceptible of any impre&s;&s;ions, had been governed by the exerci&s;e of power, not by per&s;ua&s;ion; that he had been taught by dry rules, but not according to nature. Authority, indeed, is indi&s;pen&s;able; and general rules, where there is a number of youth, cannot be avoided. But the &s;eat of empire &s;hould be the heart; and gen|eral rules &s;hould be made to bend to par|ticular circum&s;tances, as far as may be, without endangering government, and making youth un&s;teady.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="022570_0248_0FB994CC9D2DCD88">THE noble writer of "Hints on Educa|tion" has propo&s;ed &s;everal weighty objec|tions again&s;t &s;ending a &s;on abroad to a public &s;chool, until &s;ufficiently prepared at home to re&s;i&s;t temptation. He di&s;ap|proves of the government and method of in&s;truction, u&s;ed in the public &s;chools in England. I believe, however, that the modern practice of many preceptors, in America, is le&s;s exceptionable. The current of his ob&s;ervations leads him to recommend a private tutor in preference to a public &s;chool. This plan may do in England, where many an opulent family may employ as many needy &s;cholars in the capacity of private tutors; but agrees not &s;o well with the abilities of Ameri|cans. "Regular hours, at &s;chool, of reading and diver&s;ion, have a woful effect. Children, after a painful le&s;&s;on, are let out to play. Their time being circum&s;cribed, appears always too &s;hort. From the height of amu&s;ement, they are forced back to a dry le&s;&s;on. Can it be expected, that in &s;uch a &s;tate of mind, they will li&s;ten to
<PB N="250" REF="022570_0249_0FB994CE9A4B4AF0">
&s;erious in&s;truction? Let them play, let them fatigue them&s;elves: guard only again&s;t &s;auntering. When &s;ufficiently tired, lead them back, with a cheerful countenance, to a le&s;&s;on, as a change of a|mu&s;ement. This is agreeable to human nature." This, the writer ob&s;erves, can be put in practice only by a private tutor. I think that &s;omething &s;imilar might be practi&s;ed in our public &s;chools; that is, the exerci&s;es may be &s;o varied, as to have the air of novelty. In a public &s;chool, it is impo&s;&s;ible that the youth &s;hould be &s;o con&s;tantly under the preceptor's eye, as is requi&s;ite at that age. "Hence, &s;ays he, it is in a mea&s;ure e&s;&s;ential, that a young man be well tutored, in morals at lea&s;t, before he is left to him&s;elf, among a num|ber of young men of different di&s;po&s;i|tions."</P>
<P>MR. Bloom&s;grove, ob&s;erving that his nephew, who was naturally of a mild, gen|tle di&s;po&s;ition, had acquired a forwardne&s;s improper for his age, and an impatience of re&s;traint, to which he had not been ac|cu&s;tomed;
<PB N="251" REF="022570_0250_0FB994D2ABB77B88">
that he a&s;&s;umed an high tone; and, in &s;hort, that he had imbibed &s;everal of the ill qualities of the different boys with whom he had a&s;&s;ociated, was convinc|ed of the nece&s;&s;ity of keeping his &s;on much longer under his own eye. Altho his nephew had not &s;o deviated from the paths of innocence and virtue, but that his prudent management cured him, in a little time, of all the ill habits he had ac|quired; yet he cho&s;e not to venture his &s;on from his own hands, until his morals were formed and well e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>TO this end, &s;everal families, agreeing in their common views, a&s;&s;ociated to fa|cilitate the in&s;truction of their children; and placed a tutor in a &s;ituation to re|ceive the pupils, and to accompany them in literary pur&s;uits and playful excur|&s;ions.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>THE nece&s;&s;ity and utility of general knowledge to the public, and e&s;pecially to the United States of America, are expre&s;&s;ed in terms, ju&s;t and &s;trong, by that renowned patriot and truly learned politician, The Vice Pre&s;ident of the&s;e &s;tates.</P>
<P>"THE in&s;truction of the people, in every kind of knowledge that can be of u&s;e to them in the practice of their moral duties, as men, citizens, and Chri&s;tians, and of their political and civil duties, as members of &s;ociety and freemen, ought to be the care of the pub|lic, and of all who have any &s;hare in the conduct of its affairs, in a manner that never yet has been practi&s;ed in any age or nation. The education here intended, is not merely that of the children of the rich, but of ev|ery rank and cla&s;s of people, down to the poore&s;t.</P>
<P>"IT is not &s;o much to &s;ay, that &s;chools for the ed|ucation of all &s;hould be placed at convenient di&s;tances, and maintained at public expen&s;e. The revenues of the &s;tate would be applied infinitely better, more char|itably, wi&s;ely, u&s;efully, and therefore politically, in this way, than even in maintaining the poor. This would be the be&s;t way of preventing the exi&s;tence of the poor.</P>
<P>"IF nations &s;hould ever be wi&s;e, in&s;tead of erecting thou&s;ands of u&s;ele&s;s offices, or engaging in unmeaning wars, they will make a fundamental maxim of this, that no human being &s;hall grow up in ignorance. In pro|portion as this is done, tyranny will di&s;appear, kings and nobles will be made to feel their equitable equali|ty with commoners, and commoners will &s;ee their in|tere&s;t and duty to re&s;pect the guardians of their laws; for guardians they mu&s;t have as long as human nature endures.</P>
<P>"THERE is no room to doubt that the &s;chools, a|cademies, and univer&s;ities&mdash;the &s;tage, the pre&s;s, the bar, the pulpit, and the parliament, might all be im|proved to better purpo&s;e, than they have been in any country for this great purpo&s;e.

<PB N="254" REF="022570_0253_0FB994D8B4311968">
that his &s;on had rather an aver&s;ion to cla&s;|&s;ical &s;tudies. For altho he had attended a grammar &s;chool before, and, in compli|ance with the wi&s;hes of his papa, had made con&s;iderable progre&s;s in the lan|guages, yet he had no love for the&s;e &s;tud|ies. He loved books; but the dry &s;tudy of Latin and Greek hung as a dead weight upon his active genius, and gave di&s;gu&s;t rather than plea&s;ure. This aver&s;ion had been increa&s;ed by the dull round, in which he had been plodding at the gram|mar &s;chool; committing to memory long le&s;&s;ons in a language he did not under|&s;tand, and dry rules of which he knew no u&s;e.</P>
<P>MISANDER, the &s;on of a re&s;pectable farmer, who attended the &s;ame &s;chool, had neither genius nor ta&s;te; and yet parental pride or partiality induced his father to think of an univer&s;ity education.

<PB N="255" REF="022570_0254_0FB994DBD726CDB8">
ought? The child of &s;mall abilities, and &s;low of apprehen&s;ion, is often condemn|ed, contrary to rea&s;on and nature, thro a long cour&s;e of &s;evere di&s;cipline, to &s;ome profe&s;&s;ional pur&s;uit in life, in which he can never excel, becau&s;e he has neither ta&s;te nor abilities for it. Another with &s;hining talents, and an unconquerable thir&s;t for literature, will be cramped in his education; the plants of nature will be &s;tinted, and the youth de&s;tined to &s;ome occupation for which he has no ta&s;te, and in which native genius can make no ex|ertions.</P>
<P>THE watchful parent, who carefully at|tends to the gradual unfoldings of nature, will be able pretty accurately to di&s;cover the mould in which the mind is ca&s;t, and what mode of education will be mo&s;t &s;uita|ble for it. Tho&s;e powers he will endeav|or to draw forth and cheri&s;h, in that way which nature &s;eems to point out: this will render them mo&s;t u&s;eful, when brought to maturity.

ca&s;t of the mind, without reference to any preconcerted plan. Mi&s;ander was de&s;|tined from the cradle to the college, with|out any regard to his abilities or inclina|tion; the con&s;equences of which we &s;hall &s;ee pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>THE education of O&s;ander is to be con|ducted in the path of nature. Therefore his preceptor was de&s;ired to let him pur|&s;ue tho&s;e &s;tudies, to which he &s;eemed mo&s;t inclined; making u&s;e of the cla&s;&s;ics only as an interlude, to diver&s;ify the &s;cene. Mr. Bloom&s;grove hoped, by the&s;e means, his &s;on would acquire a reli&s;h for them. This hope was excited by the love which he him&s;elf had for the literature of the ancients. As he advanced in life, he ex|perienced more and more of the plea&s;ures of knowledge; and nothing could be more natural than to wi&s;h his &s;on to ta&s;te the &s;ame plea&s;ures. To a man who delights in books and contemplation, &s;olitude can|not be irk&s;ome; nor will this &s;ource of entertainment, like mo&s;t others, be ex|hau&s;ted by age.</P>

<P>TO cheri&s;h in the heart moral &s;en|timents, and engage youth to the practice of prudential virtues, you allow to be a matter of the highe&s;t importance. "But how, you a&s;k, is this to be effected?" I conceive it, my dear &s;ir, to be a thing practicable, however difficult it may ap|pear. The &s;ucce&s;s of this attempt de|pends more on ob&s;erving the operations of human nature in various individuals, and the particular temper of the children to be taught, than on any dry rules. Mankind are formed with a diver&s;ity of pa&s;&s;ions and inclinations. But it u&s;ually happens that &s;ome one of the&s;e predomi|nates over all the others, or, as was the ca&s;e in &s;ome periods of the Roman em|pire, there are two which bare &s;way alter|nately. This appears in childhood. Some children you early perceive to be proud and haughty; others, mode&s;t and diffident: &s;ome, warm and pa&s;&s;ionate; others, cool and gentle: &s;ome, ob&s;tinate

and tenacious; others, &s;oft and flexible: &s;ome, covetous and &s;elfi&s;h; others, liberal and benevolent. When I &s;peak of the&s;e natural pa&s;&s;ions, and the difference in the &s;trength of them, I only mean that there is an aptne&s;s in the objects about us to touch &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;prings of action more forcibly than others; and that different per&s;ons will be variou&s;ly affected by the &s;ame objects.</P>

<P>MR. Bloom&s;grove was careful to impre&s;s on the minds of his children, maxims of prudence, re&s;olution, and indu&s;try. In order to draw their attention, and excite the love of the&s;e qualities, he gave them an example from the economy of Augu&s;|tus Ce&s;ar, Emperor of Rome; and of the indu&s;try of his wife Livia, and his &s;i&s;ter Octavia, who &s;pun all the clothes the Emperor wore: of "Scipio, the glory of Rome, and terror of Carthage, who dre&s;&s;|ed his garden with his own hands: and of the venerable old &s;enator, Fabricius, illu&s;|trious by many triumphs, who &s;upped on|ly on the herbs he him&s;elf had rai&s;ed." The&s;e were examples of &s;ocial and do|me&s;tic virtues, very u&s;eful to the child|ren, and they derived great force from the illu&s;trious characters who exhibited them.</P>

<P>AS children are naturally candid, Mr. Bloom&s;grove found it not only prac|ticable, but a plea&s;ant ta&s;k to keep them &s;o. He &s;hewed them the beauty of this temper, by relating examples of it in ma|ny celebrated characters. E&s;pecially an

<P>CHILDREN who are taught to be frank and candid, if they find they can always be &s;o without danger, will never think of di&s;&s;embling, but when they are con&s;cious of having done wrong; and then, if they find as much &s;ecurity, and more comfort, in confe&s;&s;ing, than in di&s;&s;embling, they will be candid and hone&s;t. Candor is the ba&s;is of friend&s;hip and mutual confi|dence. It &s;ecures the good will of others; is the &s;weetener of &s;ociety, and endears men even to their enemies; and a high degree of it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the prac|tice of any vice.</P>
<P>THERE is a meanne&s;s which &s;ometimes appears in children, that does not belong to nature; it is either caught from exam|ple, or in&s;pired by injudicious manage|ment.

This is &s;ometimes the effect of too great &s;everity; their &s;pirits are broken by too great re&s;traint, and they become &s;heep|i&s;h.

minds of his children, that a man &s;hould be regarded in proportion to the good he does. There cannot be a more u&s;eful le&s;&s;on of in&s;truction to the young mind than this. Dazzled with the glitter and pageantry of the gay world, young people are too apt to re&s;pect a man according to the wealth he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, and the external &s;how he makes; and to emulate tho&s;e qualities, while real virtues, which make no &s;plendid figure, are overlooked or neg|lected.

guarded his children; teaching them that the di&s;tinction between high and low, rich and poor, is nothing in compari&s;on with that which ari&s;es from the different degrees of u&s;efulne&s;s in the world; that the hone&s;t, indu&s;trious farmer who trains his children to be u&s;eful mem|bers of &s;ociety, is more worthy of re&s;pect, than the mo&s;t wealthy who regards not the poverty or di&s;tre&s;&s;es of his neighbor, while he gratifies all his own expen&s;ive fancies. He accu&s;tomed them to bridle their love of plea&s;ure; and endeavored to initiate them into the true &s;ecret of worldly felicity; &s;hewing them that it con&s;i&s;ted in the &s;uitablene&s;s of a per&s;on's &s;ituation to his natural ta&s;te; in the tem|perate u&s;e of the enjoyments of life; in doing good to others, and in making ev|ery condition and circum&s;tance in life &s;ub&s;ervient to the intere&s;ts of virtue.</P>

therefore, was his object, without over|heating the imagination; to in&s;pire cour|age and firmne&s;s, without kindling the fire of ambition into an unhallowed flame. He was more &s;olicitous to make his &s;on a good, than a great man. It is vanity that makes mo&s;t people prefer &s;hining and dangerous qualifications to the more retired and milder virtues: the latter are the only qualities which can en|&s;ure the repo&s;e and happine&s;s of life.</P>
<P>ALTHO he had every thing to build upon which ance&s;try in America could give, yet he carefully in&s;tilled into his children this idea, that per&s;onal merit was what they &s;hould attend to, without refer|ence to ance&s;tors. Often would he re|peat to them, in a winter evening, or in a lei&s;ure hour after dinner, the &s;peech of Gaius Marius to the Romans, in which he &s;hewed the ab&s;urdity of their conduct in he&s;itating to confer on him the rank of gen|eral, on account of his de&s;cent.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>"I HAVE, continues he, from my youth, been familiar with toils and dangers. I was faithful to your intere&s;t, my countrymen, when I &s;erved you for no reward but that of honor. It is not my de&s;ign to betray you now, that you have conferred upon me a place of profit. You have committed to my conduct the war in Jugurtha. The Patricians are offended at this. But, where would be the wi&s;dom of giving &s;uch a command to one of their honorable body? a per&s;on of illu&s;trious birth, of ancient family, of innumerable &s;tatues, but&mdash;of no experience? What &s;ervice could his long line of dead ance&s;tors, or his multitude of motionle&s;s &s;tatues, do his country in the day of battle? What could &s;uch a general do, but, in his trepidation, have recour&s;e to &s;ome inferior commander for direc|tion in difficulties to which he was not him&s;elf equal? Thus your Patrician general would in fact have a gen|eral over him; &s;o that the commander would &s;till be a Plebeian. So true is this, my countrymen, that I have, my&s;elf, known tho&s;e, who have been cho&s;en con&s;uls, begin then to read the hi&s;tory of their own country, of which, till that time, they were totally ignorant; that is, they fir&s;t obtained the employment, and then be|thought them&s;elves of the qualifications nece&s;&s;ary for the proper di&s;charge of it.</P>
<P>"I SUBMIT to your judgment, Romans, on which &s;ide the advantage lies, when a compari&s;on is made be|tween Patrician haughtine&s;s and Plebeian experience. The very actions, which they have only read, I have part|ly &s;een, and partly my&s;elf atchieved. What they know by reading, I know by action. They are plea&s;ed to &s;light my mean birth: I de&s;pi&s;e their mean characters. Want of birth and fortune is the objection again&s;t me; want of per&s;onal worth again&s;t them. But are not all men of the &s;ame &s;pecies! What can make a difference between one man and another, but the endowments of the mind? For my part, I &s;hall always look upon the brave&s;t man as the noble&s;t man. Suppo&s;e it were in|quired of the fathers of &s;uch Patricians as Albinus and Ba&s;tia, whether, if they had their choice, they would de&s;ire &s;ons of their character or mine? What would they an&s;wer, but that they &s;hould wi&s;h the worthie&s;t to be their &s;ons? If the Patricians have rea&s;on to de&s;pi&s;e me, let them likewi&s;e de&s;pi&s;e their an|ce&s;tors, who&s;e nobility was the fruit of their vir|tue. Do they envy the honors be&s;towed upon me? let them envy likewi&s;e, my labors, my ab&s;tinence, and the dangers I have undergone for my country, by which I have acquired them. But tho&s;e worthle&s;s men lead &s;uch a life of inactivity, as if they de&s;pi&s;ed any honors you can be&s;tow; while they a&s;pire to hon|ors, as if they had de&s;erved them by the mo&s;t indu&s;|trious virtue. They lay claim to the rewards of activ|ity, for their having enjoyed the plea&s;ures of luxury. Yet none can be more lavi&s;h than they are in prai&s;e of their ance&s;tors: and they imagine they honor them|&s;elves by celebrating their forefathers; whereas they do the very contrary: for as much as their ance&s;tors were di&s;tingui&s;hed for their virtues, &s;o much are they di&s;graced by their vices. The glory of ance&s;tors ca&s;ts a light, indeed, upon their po&s;terity; but it only &s;erves to &s;hew what the de&s;cendants are. It alike exhibits to public view their degeneracy and their worth. I own I cannot boa&s;t of the deeds of my forefathers; but I hope I may an&s;wer the cavils of the Patricians, by &s;tanding up in defence of what I have done my&s;elf.</P>
<P>"OBSERVE now, my countrymen, the inju&s;tice of the Patricians. They arrogate to them&s;elves honors on account of the exploits done by their forefathers, while they will not allow me the due prai&s;e for per|forming the &s;ame &s;ort of actions in my own per&s;on. He has no &s;tatues, they cry, of his family. He can trace no venerable line of ance&s;tors. What then? Is it matter of more prai&s;e to di&s;grace one's illu&s;trious ance&s;tors, than to become illu&s;trious by one's own good behavior? What if I can &s;hew no &s;tatues of my fam|ily? I can &s;hew the &s;tandards, the armor, and the trappings, which I have my&s;elf taken from the van|qui&s;hed. I can &s;hew the &s;cars of tho&s;e wounds, which I have received by facing the enemies of my country. The&s;e are my &s;tatues. The&s;e are the honors I boa&s;t of&punc; not left me by inheritance, as theirs; but earned by toil, by ab&s;tinence, by valor; amid&s;t clouds of du&s;t, and &s;eas of blood; &s;cenes of action, where the effem|inate Patricians, who endeavor by indirect means to depreciate me in your e&s;teem, have never dared to &s;hew their faces."</P></NOTE></P>

<P>MISANDER might have been, in a great mea&s;ure, cured of the&s;e ill qualities by a &s;ea&s;onable attention to them; or they might never have appeared, had they not been fanned into a flame by injudicious management. If oppo&s;ite di&s;po&s;itions had been cheri&s;hed with due care, they would have prevailed and borne the&s;e down. But, unfortunately for him, he was left, like too many other children, to grow up without cultivation; and, as "ill weeds grow apace," he was &s;oon overrun by evil pa&s;&s;ions. The&s;e became too deeply rooted ever to be eradicated; and tho conducted into the field of &s;cience, it was only to make his follies the more con&s;picuous.

<P>PHILO has merit, but not great talents. He has moderate abilities, with a good di&s;|po&s;ition, and a noble &s;oul. He has forti|tude, and, for his age, a &s;ound judgment. With the&s;e qualities, directed in a proper manner, Philo promi&s;es fair to make a greater, and, certainly, a more u&s;eful man, than many who are endued with &s;uperior genius. The difference of character be|tween the&s;e two youth mu&s;t be principal|ly a&s;cribed to the difference in their do|me&s;tic education. The one had been in|dulged in every thing; and never had his mind directed to higher objects, than tho&s;e which are &s;uited to excite childi&s;h de&s;ires.

He recommended to him to ob&s;erve the max|im of a Roman emperor, never to &s;peak, when he was in a pa&s;&s;ion, till he had lei&s;urely repeated all the letters in the al|phabet. He in&s;tanced al&s;o Socrates &s;ay|ing to a &s;ervant, who had offended him&mdash; "I would treat you as you de&s;erve, were I not in a pa&s;&s;ion." But his generous &s;oul melted at the relation of the di&s;pa&s;|&s;ionate conduct of Themi&s;tocles, who was the means of &s;aving Greece from ruin by his calmne&s;s, in an&s;wering the pa&s;&s;ionate threatenings of Euribiades, admiral of the Grecian fleet which was collected again&s;t the Per&s;ians.</P>

Subdued by this in|&s;tance of &s;elf command, Euribiades li&s;ten|ed, followed the advice of the young offi|cer, and obtained a complete victory. The cool behavior of Themi&s;tocles &s;aved Greece, which would probably have been ruined by the old general." Not more complete was the victory over the Per&s;ians than that which the recital gained over the &s;pirits of O&s;ander. He confe&s;&s;ed his error, and declared that he wi&s;hed for nothing &s;o much as to be a &s;econd The|mi&s;tocles. By embracing tho&s;e opportu|nities which particular incidents afforded, Mr. Bloom&s;grove's lectures were agreea|ble and doubly u&s;eful. This method proved effectual with his children; not to prevent an emotion of anger &s;ometimes; but to accu&s;tom them to re&s;train their pa&s;&s;ions, and to reduce them &s;peedily to order, when they were put into motion; to remain &s;ilent, while they were under the influence of irritated pa&s;&s;ions; and to be doubly on their guard, when injured or affronted.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="022570_0278_0FB9951DD2AB8E68">THOSE per&s;ons are very ill qualified for &s;ociety, who take fire at every in&s;ult, and give vent to their pa&s;&s;ions without re|&s;traint.

<HEAD>LETTER XLVIII.</HEAD>
<P>XENOPHON, in his Cyropoedia, tells us that "The Per&s;ian children went to &s;chool, and &s;pent their time in learning the principles of ju&s;tice, as children do in other countries to learn the knowledge of letters. Their governors devoted the greate&s;t part of the day to deciding cau&s;es among them, re&s;pecting theft, violence, and deceit; puni&s;hing tho&s;e whom they found guilty in any of the&s;e matters, or who were convicted of unju&s;t accu&s;ation. Ingratitude too, they puni&s;hed; a crime, which, tho the principal occa&s;ion of ani|mo&s;ity, is little taken notice of among men."</P>
<P>HAPPY would it be for this ri&s;ing em|pire, if a &s;imilar practice was adopted by our &s;chools, academies, and univer&s;ities, and by all heads of families. Children are &s;oon to be initiated into &s;ociety; and &s;ociety cannot exi&s;t, unle&s;s the principles of ju&s;tice are under&s;tood, and its &s;acred bonds pre&s;erved inviolate. It requires
<PB N="281" REF="022570_0280_0FB99524976BED08">
no ab&s;tract rea&s;onings to become acquaint|ed with tho&s;e principles. They lie near the &s;urface, and are within the reach of the mo&s;t moderate capacities. The prin|ciples of commutative ju&s;tice, which are expre&s;&s;ed in that &s;hort &s;entence&mdash;"All things what&s;oever ye would that others &s;hould do unto you, do ye even &s;o unto them," are applied to the natural &s;en&s;e of right and wrong. They are addre&s;&s;ed to the feelings of every man, and appeal to their own &s;en&s;e of wrong, when unju&s;tly treated, to a&s;&s;ign to them&s;elves the &s;ame penalty in doing inju&s;tice to others, which they do to tho&s;e who injure and offend them.</P>
<P>THAT a &s;en&s;e of right and wrong is nat|ural to man, and ought to be cheri&s;hed by education, and explained to children as &s;oon as they are capable of under&s;tand|ing the relation of things, was an opinion in which Mr. Bloom&s;grove was fully con|firmed. He therefore took care to ex|plain and impre&s;s on the minds of his children the obligations of ju&s;tice and
<PB N="282" REF="022570_0281_0FB995272841AA00">
equity in all their actions, as &s;oon as they could comprehend any thing of the&s;e ob|ligations; and he enjoined their preceptor to let no favorable opportunity pa&s;s, with|out doing the &s;ame.</P>
<P>IN order to try their invention, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in under&s;tanding the principles of ju&s;tice, he would propo&s;e que&s;tions to them on the ca&s;e of certain tran&s;actions, and reque&s;t their determination. The&s;e judiciary proceedings were as amu&s;ing as they were in&s;tructive to the children; and while they led them to an acquaint|ance with the principles of common ju&s;|tice, they gave him an opportunity to cor|rect their judgment when wrong.</P>
<P>WHAT do you think, my &s;on, &s;aid Mr. Bloom&s;grove to O&s;ander, one evening after he came home from &s;chool, when Mi&s;ander had been puni&s;hed for doing wrong to his mates&mdash;of the conduct of Cyrus?&mdash;Pray, papa, repeat the &s;tory. That I will do with plea&s;ure, my &s;on, if you will profit by it.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="022570_0282_0FB9952838EF3200">"CYRUS was a little boy of a good di&s;|po&s;ition, and a very humane temper, and had been well educated from childhood. One evening his father a&s;ked him what he had done or learned that day.&mdash;Sir, &s;aid Cyrus, I was puni&s;hed to day for de|ciding unju&s;tly. How &s;o? &s;aid his father. There were two boys, replied Cyrus, one of them was a great, and the other a little boy. It happened that the little boy had a coat that was much too big for him; but the great boy had one that &s;carcely reached below his middle, and was too tight for him in every part; upon which the great boy propo&s;ed to the little one to ex|change coats with him, becau&s;e then, &s;aid he, we &s;hall both be exactly fitted, for your coat is as much too big for you, as mine is too little for me. The little boy would not con&s;ent to the propo&s;al; upon which the great boy took his coat away by force, and gave his own to the little boy in exchange. While they were di&s;|puting upon this &s;ubject, I chanced to pa&s;s by, and they agreed to make me judge
<PB N="284" REF="022570_0283_0FB99529B4AB3B08">
of the affair. But I decided that the little boy &s;hould keep the little coat, and the great boy the great one; for which judg|ment my ma&s;ter puni&s;hed me. Why &s;o? &s;aid Cyrus's father; was not the little coat mo&s;t proper for the little boy, and the large coat for the great boy? Yes, &s;ir, an&s;wered Cyrus; but my ma&s;ter told me, I was not made judge to examine which coat be&s;t fitted the boys, but to decide, whether it was ju&s;t that the great boy &s;hould take away the coat of the little one again&s;t his con&s;ent; and therefore I de|cided unju&s;tly, and de&s;erved to be pun|i&s;hed." I think &s;o too, replied O&s;ander; for no body has any right to take anoth|er's coat without his con&s;ent.</P>
<P>MR. Bloom&s;grove was going to relate &s;ome other in&s;tances of erroneous judg|ment about right and wrong actions; but ju&s;t as he fini&s;hed this, the bell rang for &s;upper, and the young ma&s;ter and mi&s;s retired to bed, much edified and plea&s;ed.</P>

<P>NOTHING can be more de&s;truc|tive to &s;ociety than fal&s;ehood; nor can any thing de&s;erve the attention of parents and teachers of children &s;o much, as to cheri&s;h in them a love of truth. This, like good coin; will pa&s;s every where; but fal&s;ehood, like counterfeit money, is liable to &s;u&s;picion; and per&s;ons addicted to this vice are de&s;pi&s;ed and rejected. There is a dignity peculiar to that character which pre&s;erves a &s;acred regard to truth, while tho&s;e of an oppo&s;ite character fall into the lowe&s;t contempt.</P>
<P>ROUSSEAU has objected, with con&s;id|erable force of rea&s;on, again&s;t the u&s;e of fables for the in&s;truction of children, as having a tendency to teach them fal&s;e|hood. A fable is in fact a fal&s;e &s;tory con|trived to teach &s;ome moral truth. "How is it po&s;&s;ible, &s;aid he, men can be &s;o blind as to call fables the moral lectures for children, without reflecting that the apo|logue, in amu&s;ing, only deceives them;
<PB N="286" REF="022570_0285_0FB9953017ED4268">
and that, &s;educed by the charms of fal&s;e|hood, the truth couched underneath it e&s;capes their notice? Yet, &s;o it is; and the means which are thus taken to render in&s;truction agreeable prevent their profit|ing by it. Fables may in&s;truct grown per&s;ons, but the naked truth &s;hould be pre&s;ented to children: for if we once &s;pread over it a veil, they will not take the trouble to lay it a&s;ide, in order to look at it."</P>
<P>WHATEVER force you may allow to the&s;e ob&s;ervations, you may be a&s;&s;ured that Mr. Bloom&s;grove was cautious of u&s;ing them. Very few ever came to his children's knowledge, until they were grown to years of di&s;cretion; and of tho&s;e few, he or his good lady had the choo&s;ing, that they might have only &s;uch as were plain and well &s;uited to convey in&s;truction without any ill effect. They paid an early attention to every circum&s;tance which had any tendency to in&s;pire their children with a regard to truth, and an abhorrence of fal&s;ehood. In order to
<PB N="287" REF="022570_0286_0FB995313A2A07A8">
this, they were careful to encourage their &s;peaking truth, by making it mo&s;t conven|ient for them. Cautious not to drive them into &s;ubterfuges and di&s;&s;imulation, they were &s;eldom found guilty of fraud or fal&s;ehood; and as they advanced to years of under&s;tanding, they were taught the nature and obligations of truth: its beautiful image was pre&s;ented to their mind in a plea&s;ing and engaging manner; and the deformity of fal&s;ehood and de|ceit, painted in all its odious colors. They repre&s;ented to their children and family, the mean and contemptible light in which tho&s;e are held, who practi&s;e &s;o ba&s;e a vice. They would adduce in&s;tances of each, &s;ome of which fell within their own ob|&s;ervation; and others &s;elected for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>ONE evening as Mr. and Mrs. Bloom&s;|grove were walking on the verdant mar|gin of the river, with their nephew, Fan|ny, and their children, the moon &s;hone beautifully upon the &s;mooth &s;urface of the water. O&s;ander, ob&s;erving that every
<PB N="288" REF="022570_0287_0FB99537278E3880">
object appeared crooked in the water, a&s;ked his papa the rea&s;on of it. In&s;tead of replying that it was occa&s;ioned by the refraction of the rays of light, as they pa&s;&s;|ed a den&s;er medium, he &s;aid that it was a deception, and that the water in that ca&s;e was not the proper repre&s;entative of the truth. Ju&s;t &s;o it is with tho&s;e who per|vert the truth, by repre&s;enting things in a fal&s;e light in many in&s;tances; they can|not be credited in other ca&s;es.</P>
<P>MRS. Bloom&s;grove turning to Fanny, a&s;ked her what &s;he had read that day, that made the deepe&s;t impre&s;&s;ion on her mind. She replied, with a mode&s;t deli|cacy peculiar to her, that the &s;tory of the frankne&s;s of a galley &s;lave in owning the truth, though he knew not but it might be the means of his ruin, had &s;truck her more than any thing &s;he had read. Re|peat it, my dear, &s;aid her excellent patron|e&s;s. That I will do with plea&s;ure, mad|am, as &s;oon as I can recollect it, and &s;hall feel my&s;elf extremely happy, if I can grat|ify you in any thing; and proceeded as follows.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="022570_0288_0FB99537F4C17A58">IN the memoirs of the Duke d'O&s;&s;una, I found the following anecdote&mdash;"The Duke having leave from his Catholic Maje&s;ty to relieve &s;ome galley &s;laves, &s;uch as he &s;hould think be&s;t de&s;erving of par|don, went on board the Admiral galley at Barcelona, and a&s;ked &s;everal of the &s;laves what were the crimes that had &s;ent them to the gallies. Every one endeavored to excu&s;e him&s;elf, that it was out of malice, that the judges were corrupted, and the like. The &s;ame que&s;tion being put to a little &s;turdy fellow, he acknowledged that he was ju&s;tly condemned; for that, being in want of money, he had robbed a man on the high way. On which, the Duke gave him a blow over the &s;houlders with a cane, &s;aying, you rogue, why &s;hould you be with &s;o many hone&s;t innocent men? get you out of their company, for &s;hame."</P>
<P>THEY were all much plea&s;ed with the &s;tory, and agreed that if any thing could entitle him to his freedom, it was his frank|ne&s;s in telling the truth, Now, &s;ays Mr. Bloom&s;grove to O&s;ander, your cou&s;in Fanny has related &s;o pretty a piece, and
<PB N="290" REF="022570_0289_0FB9953980DA3360">
done it very well, (at this unexpected compliment Fanny's cheeks were crim|&s;oned) let us hear what you can give on the &s;ame &s;ubject. O&s;ander, with his u&s;ual frankne&s;s, immediately proceeds&mdash;"Eu|genio had contracted &s;uch a habit of ly|ing, by the bad company he kept, that he could &s;carce ever be believed by his friends; and was often &s;u&s;pected of faults, becau&s;e he denied the commi&s;&s;ion of them; and could not get reparation for injuries of which he complained, be|becau&s;e he could never be credited. A lu&s;ty boy, of whom Eugenio had told &s;ome fal&s;ehoods, often way laid him as he went to &s;chool, and beat him very much. Con|&s;cious of his ill de&s;ert, Eugenio bore for &s;ome time, in &s;ilence, the cha&s;ti&s;ement; but the frequent repetition of it, at la&s;t overpowered his re&s;olution, and he com|plained to his father of the u&s;age he met with. His father, tho doubtful of the truth of his account, applied to the pa|rents of the boy who he &s;aid abu&s;ed him. But he could obtain no redre&s;s from them, and only received for an&s;wer, "Your &s;on
<PB N="291" REF="022570_0290_0FB9953BAD1601E8">
is a notorious liar, and we pay no regard to his a&s;&s;ertions. Eugenio was therefore obliged to &s;ubmit to the wonted correc|tion, till full &s;atisfaction had been taken by his antagoni&s;t for the injury which he had &s;u&s;tained." The evening advanced, and they all returned home much plea&s;ed with the excur&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t formation of children's minds being impre&s;&s;ions; and their fir&s;t actions the notices of impre&s;&s;ions, it will follow that children are capable of con&s;iderable progre&s;s in fal&s;ehood, before they can learn the u&s;e of words. An ignorant or carele&s;s nur&s;e, not di&s;tingui&s;hing the dif|ferent tones of pain and hunger, will &s;oon teach a child to deceive in tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations. Hence it is that parents, who do not at|tend carefully to their offspring, are a&s;|toni&s;hed that the fir&s;t u&s;e of &s;peech is to deceive. This they a&s;cribe to an unhap|py perver&s;ion in the nature of their child|ren; or to any but the true rea&s;on&mdash;their own criminal negligence. Under an ap|prehen&s;ion that their children were born with a lie in their mouth, or with lying
<PB N="292" REF="022570_0291_0FB9953C867F6420">
con&s;titutions, they attempt beating it out by &s;tripes. The di&s;order will only be in|crea&s;ed by the&s;e means. Proper manage|ment would have prevented it. A very cautious and tender u&s;age is nece&s;&s;ary to remedy the evil.</P>
<P>CHILDREN can have no de&s;ire to de|ceive, till it is made their intere&s;t. They feel their dependence, and naturally wi&s;h to be on good terms with tho&s;e on whom they depend; but if they are directly charged with any crime, and are &s;en&s;ible that if they plead guilty, it will endanger that harmony, they will deny it. If they have not been trained to make voluntary confe&s;&s;ions, at lea&s;t to great candor and frankne&s;s, they will di&s;&s;emble, when que&s;t|ioned; and deny, when charged with a fault.</P>
<P>IF O&s;ander, at any time, &s;eems di&s;po&s;ed to equivocate, his papa draws him off from &s;uch ungenerous attempts. He queries whether the frankne&s;s of the galley &s;lave did not make him appear better, than the wealthie&s;t man who has no regard to the
<PB N="293" REF="022570_0292_0FB99541E5592840">
truth. As to Rozella, her mamma's prudent management in&s;pired her with &s;o delicate a regard to truth, that &s;he would &s;hudder at the thought, even of the lea&s;t equivocation. An excellent example for tho&s;e of her age!</P>

<P>THE virtue, fidelity, &s;eems to be but little under&s;tood by children. They are made, like a parrot, to promi&s;e any thing that is put into their mouth, without know|ing any thing of the nature of the obliga|tion. If the fear of puni&s;hment or the hopes of reward lead them to make engagements, which they will violate as &s;oon as the force of the motive abates, the violation is not to be con&s;idered as want of the principle in the child. It mu&s;t be charged to im|prudence in the parent or preceptor. A child cannot be &s;aid to be unfaithful in not fulfilling engagements which he makes, before he is capable of under&s;tand|ing the nature of &s;uch obligations. No
<PB N="294" REF="022570_0293_0FB9954336569178">
&s;uch promi&s;es, therefore, &s;hould ever be extorted from them. The obligation does not exi&s;t in nature, but in contract or agreement. If the nature of the obli|gation is not &s;o far under&s;tood, as that the moral &s;en&s;e of right and wrong will exert it&s;elf in producing a fulfilment, from what cau&s;e do we look for it?</P>
<P>MRS. Bloom&s;grove was ever attentive to this matter, when the children were young and under her more immediate care; nor did their papa ever exact any promi&s;es of them, until they were able to comprehend the rea&s;on, and &s;ee the con|&s;equences of promi&s;ing. The principal &s;en&s;e which children have of engagements, is their utility. But when the innate &s;en&s;e of right and wrong begins to exert it|&s;elf, and con&s;cience impo&s;es that as a duty which convenience only had dictated be|fore, then the force of engagement is felt from an under&s;tanding of its principles. The&s;e are unfolded to O&s;ander as he can bear them, and enforced by con&s;iderations &s;uited to touch his feelings. He is taught
<PB N="295" REF="022570_0294_0FB9954550674B88">
never to promi&s;e any thing &s;lightly; but to con&s;ider what he is about to engage, and whether he &s;hall be able to perform; and having made an engagement, how|ever trifling, he is clo&s;ely watched as to the fulfilment of it. This &s;trengthens his re&s;olution and accu&s;toms him to punctu|ality. But if he at any time violates his word, his papa expre&s;&s;es as much &s;urpri&s;e as indignation; and tells him, "If you were not quite young, &s;uch an action would be very di&s;graceful; and if you &s;hould do the like again, you would ren|der your&s;elf contemptible in the eyes of every one."</P>
<P>HIS in&s;tructions were always accompa|nied with example. He con&s;idered promi&s;es made to children as of &s;acred obligation; and was careful to fulfil them, however trifling in them&s;elves. Many parents fail much in this point. They promi&s;e children, perhaps to get rid of a pre&s;ent importunity, that they &s;hall have &s;uch a thing, or go to &s;uch a place, with|out any thought or intention of fulfilling
<PB N="296" REF="022570_0295_0FB9954670CE7220">
their promi&s;e. The child remembers the promi&s;e, and, at the time, claims a per|formance; but the parent has forgotten it, or declines a fulfilment. What is this but teaching them to deceive and be un|faithful?</P>
<P>IN &s;ome animals there appears an in|&s;tinctive principle, which bears a &s;trong analogy to this virtue. It begets the &s;tronge&s;t attachment to certain objects; and leads to do every thing in a certain line, which the mo&s;t &s;acred engagements could effect. But this moves in a con|fined circle, and never enlarges as it goes round. The &s;trength of it, in &s;ome in|&s;tances, puts to the blu&s;h men who claim the rank of intelligence, and who profe&s;s to act on principles &s;uperior to in|&s;tinct.</P>
<P>THE following in&s;tance of fidelity in a dog, is worthy of notice; and it mu&s;t be the more agreeable, as it happened not many years ago&mdash;An officer in the late American army, on his &s;tation at the we&s;t|ward, went out in the morning with his
<PB N="297" REF="022570_0296_0FB9954D0BE5AF50">
dog and gun, in que&s;t of game. Ventur|ing too far from the garri&s;on, he was fired upon by an Indian, who was lurking in the bu&s;hes, and in&s;tantly fell to the ground. The Indian running to him, &s;truck him on the head with his tomma|hawk in order to di&s;patch him; but the button of his hat fortunately warding off the edge, he was only &s;tunned by the blow. With &s;avage brutality he applied the &s;calping knife, and ha&s;tened away with this trophy of his horrid cruelty, leaving the officer for dead, and none to relieve or con&s;ole him, but his faithful dog.</P>
<P>THE afflicted creature gave every ex|pre&s;&s;ion of attachment, fidelity, and affec|tion. He licked the wounds with inex|pre&s;&s;ible tenderne&s;s, and mourned the fate of his beloved ma&s;ter. Having per|formed every office which &s;ympathy dic|tated, and &s;agacity could invent, without being able to remove his ma&s;ter from the fatal &s;pot, or procure from him any &s;igns of life, or his wonted expre&s;&s;ions of affec|tion

to him, he ran off in que&s;t of help. Bending his cour&s;e towards the river, where two men were fi&s;hing, he urged them by all the powers of native rhetoric to accompany him to the woods.</P>
<P>THE men were &s;u&s;picious of a decoy to an ambu&s;cade, and dared not venture to follow the dog, which finding all his ca|re&s;&s;es fail, returned to the care o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his ma&s;|ter; and, licking his wounds a &s;econd time, renewed all his tenderne&s;&s;es, but with no better &s;ucce&s;s than before. A|gain he returned to the men; once more to try his &s;kill in alluring them to his a&s;|&s;i&s;tance. In this attempt he was more &s;ucce&s;sful than in the other. The men &s;eeing his &s;olicitude, began to think the dog might have di&s;covered &s;ome valuable game, and determined to hazard the con|&s;equences of following him. Tran&s;ported with his &s;ucce&s;s, the affectionate creature hurried them along by every expre&s;&s;ion of ardor. Pre&s;ently they arrive at the &s;pot where&mdash;behold an officer wounded, &s;calped, weltering in his own gore, and

faint with the lo&s;s of blood&mdash;Suffice it to &s;ay, he was yet alive. They carried him to the fort, where the fir&s;t dre&s;&s;ings were performed. A &s;uppuration immediately took place, and he was &s;oon conveyed to the ho&s;pital at Albany, where, in a few weeks, he entirely recovered, and was able to return to his duty.</P>
<P>THIS worthy officer owed his life, probably, to the fidelity of this &s;agacious dog. His tongue, which the gentleman afterward declared, gave him the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite plea&s;ure, clarified the wound in the mo&s;t effectual manner, and his per&s;e|verance brought that a&s;&s;i&s;tance without which he mu&s;t &s;oon have peri&s;hed.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS day is announced to us, the agreeable intelligence of the arrival of our late BELOVED General, now the illu&s;tri|ous Pre&s;ident of the United States, at the pre&s;ent &s;eat of federal government.</P>
<P>I SUSPEND all other concerns for a moment, to felicitate you on the au&s;pi|cious event which commences a new era in the hi&s;tory of human affairs. Other nations, after many years of effort and mi&s;ery in the cau&s;e of freedom, have been obliged, either to yield to their haughty
<PB N="10" REF="022570_0307_0FB99017ACFD6908">
conquerors, or to accept conditions of a partial deliverance from their oppre&s;&s;ors, unworthy of their attempts. But Amer|ica pre&s;ents to the world&punc; the &s;ublime and affecting &s;pectacle of a brave people, after a few years &s;truggle again&s;t a proud and rapacious nation, becoming free and in|dependent; founding a mighty empire, which, tho agitated awhile, like the &s;well|ing bo&s;om of the ocean, is now &s;ettling down into calmne&s;s and tranquillity. She pre&s;ents to the world a con&s;titution of civil government, which, founded in equality and ju&s;tice, unites energy in the executive with the liberty of the &s;ubject; in &s;uch a manner as mo&s;t effectually to &s;ecure the re&s;pon&s;ibility of the one, and the common good of the other.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ent may with propriety be &s;tyled the age of philo&s;ophy; and Amer|ica, the empire of rea&s;on. The agitations which u&s;ually follow &s;uch convul&s;ions, and the di&s;memberment of kingdoms, are rapidly &s;ub&s;iding, and &s;he is fa&s;t ri&s;ing in|to &s;uperior con&s;equence. America now
<PB N="11" REF="022570_0308_0FB9901A98402140">
promi&s;es fair to be the a&s;ylum of genius and liberty, the &s;eat of arts and learning, and the univer&s;al emporium of wealth and commerce.</P>
<P>ALL this is acknowleged by a tran&s;at|lantic panegyri&s;t, who &s;ays&mdash;"Amid&s;t the number of intrepid &s;oldiers, of experienc|ed generals, and wi&s;e legi&s;lators, who di&s;|tingui&s;hed them&s;elves on this occa&s;ion, an illu&s;trious name appears, which is not on|ly eminently con&s;picuous in the annals of the pre&s;ent age, but &s;hines unrivalled by the mo&s;t celebrated characters of antiquity. The irre&s;olute only, who fail in re&s;i&s;ting oppre&s;&s;ion, are branded with the name of rebels. The brave, who &s;ucceed in the arduous &s;trife, reap, with the glorious fruit of their toils, the laurel of renown: convinced of this, the great WASHING|TON drew his &s;word; at the eventful, perilous moment, when the world, with eager concern, attended to the fate of A|merica, in the infancy of her &s;trength, un|ju&s;tly invaded by the overwhelming power of a monarchy, grown wanton, and
<PB N="12" REF="022570_0309_0FB9901F8AB7E968">
deemed irre&s;i&s;tible: thro an almo&s;t un|interrupted &s;eries of victory and conque&s;t, this great man ru&s;hed forward; and, to &s;ave his country, ri&s;ked his fame, his property, and his life! Animated with a generous, a di&s;intere&s;ted ardor, he &s;tood forth a volunteer in the &s;acred cau&s;e of ju&s;tice! Freedom, and not power, was his aim: independence, happine&s;s, and the prayers of virtuous millions, were his re|ward."</P>
<P>I AM highly gratified by your account of the emulation which appeared in every cla&s;s of citizens to be foremo&s;t in their expre&s;&s;ions of joy on the occa&s;ion. It mu&s;t be flattering to a mind, &s;uperior to vanity, to &s;tand unrivalled in the hearts of a grateful country, who unanimou&s;ly hail him WELCOME to the &s;eat of federal empire.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM about to arraign my&s;elf at the tribunal of your &s;ex.

<P>I HAVE, therefore, &s;ent to your peru&s;al tho&s;e &s;heets on the &s;ubject of female edu|cation, which I mentioned in my la&s;t. If, in ca&s;ting an eye over them, any thing &s;hould appear unfriendly to your &s;ex, your goodne&s;s will place it to an error in judgment, not to a want of e&s;teem and re&s;pect for &s;o amiable a part of our &s;pe|cies. If your long acquaintance with do|me&s;tic life, and the nece&s;&s;ary qualifica|tions

for di&s;charging its duties, &s;ugge&s;ts any expedients for cultivating tho&s;e qual|ities which have e&s;caped my notice, you will be &s;o obliging, Madam, as to mention them with freedom.</P>
<P>I HAVE a&s;&s;igned to the female an im|portant rank in dome&s;tic &s;ociety; and, with that rank, a laborious ta&s;k&mdash;a ta&s;k impo&s;ed by nature; not by me. In the former part of the&s;e memoirs, I have &s;hewn the obligations our &s;ex are under to participate the cares, and lighten the burden of yours, by every po&s;&s;ible ex|pre&s;&s;ion of tenderne&s;s and affection. The thoughtful, anxious, and affectionate mother intere&s;ts my e&s;teem, and com|mands my &s;incere&s;t re&s;pect. She renders the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to the world; and doubly ble&s;&s;es her hu&s;band by the happine&s;s &s;he entails upon the objects of their mutual affection.</P>
<P>ON the mo&s;t critical, and perhaps, lea&s;t plea&s;ing part of the &s;ubject, I have only to &s;ay, that I have endeavored to follow nature, and to vindicate the ju&s;t claims

<P>ANY thing that implies &s;ervility, or a yielding of any right or prerogative of nature, I con&s;ider as di&s;honorable in our &s;ex to exact; and, if po&s;&s;ible, more &s;o in yours to grant. Nor do I admit of an idea of the kind, in any thing I have &s;aid on the &s;ubject of the PRIORITY of men.

<P>WHEN, therefore, I am pleading for the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of females, I mean to recom|mend to mothers to cheri&s;h, by education, tho&s;e habits of re&s;traint, and that native mode&s;ty by which only they can pre&s;erve propriety of character. Whatever incon|venience they may &s;uffer from this &s;pecies of re&s;traint, is amply compen&s;ated by their power of command over the will and affections of men; which recipro|cates the influence, and the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and, like the laws of attraction and re|pul&s;ion, pre&s;erves the equilibrium of the world.</P>
<P>YOUR con&s;equence in the creation I fear not to acknowledge. I a&s;&s;ert it with

to an&s;wer the important end they have in view; and I will not injure my own &s;ex &s;o much, as once to doubt their favorable reception with the females of this country in general.

<P>THE dignity of females con&s;i&s;ts in their acting always agreeably to their own character; and in pre&s;erving their influ|ence in that way which nature points out; by a mixture of re&s;erve and benevolence, in young women; of affection and con|de&s;cen&s;ion, in the married &s;tate; by a dil|igent attention to the formation of the character and manners of children of both &s;exes, in their earlie&s;t years, and the entire education of daughters.</P>
<P>THE importance of the female character con&s;i&s;ts in the exten&s;ive influence which the &s;ex has on the face of human affairs. This influence is much greater than is commonly imagined; greater than women them&s;elves have any idea of; for, be&s;ides their exten&s;ive &s;way over gallants and hu&s;bands, the minds of our whole &s;pecies receive their fir&s;t formation under the fo&s;tering care of female tenderne&s;s. How, then, does female education ri&s;e into con|&s;equence? How much prai&s;e is due to
<PB N="24" REF="022570_0321_0FB990448B207ED8">
tho&s;e mothers, who, filling with dignity their own rank in &s;ociety, and di&s;charging the duties of dome&s;tic life with fidelity, ble&s;s the world with virtuous &s;ons and amiable daughters?</P>
<P>GREAT as the con&s;equences of female education are to the world, it mu&s;t be ac|knowledged that it has been much neg|lected, and the objects of it greatly mi&s;|taken. Boarding &s;chools have been con|&s;idered as the &s;eminaries of female educa|tion. Here they have been taught a graceful deportment, &s;ome of the fine arts, and the le&s;s u&s;eful parts of needle work. They have learned to di&s;&s;emble gracefully, rather than to think or act virtuou&s;ly. To what purpo&s;e is all this, if they are not taught the &s;cience of econ|omy, and the nece&s;&s;ary branches of do|me&s;tic bu&s;ine&s;s? Let their young hearts be in&s;pired with virtuous principles, and with benevolence which is the ba&s;is of true politene&s;s, and they will &s;oon ac|quire all the forms which are nece&s;&s;ary to good breeding. Let them be made ac|quainted
<PB N="25" REF="022570_0322_0FB99046067EBC28">
with the mo&s;t u&s;eful kind of lit|erature, and they will not only be better qualified to be mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of families, but more &s;uitable for companions and friends in the connubial &s;tate. Females &s;hould be directed to &s;uch &s;tudies, as have a ten|dency to enlarge the under&s;tanding, with|out the labor of clo&s;e inve&s;tigation; to entertain the mind, while they direct the affections of the heart. Economy and do|me&s;tic employments are nece&s;&s;ary branch|es of female education; and works of in|genuity and fancy may innocently and agreeably fill up many of their lei&s;ure hours.</P>
<P>IT is not the bu&s;ine&s;s of education to alter the cour&s;e of nature, but to follow her dictates, and bring to perfection the plants of her own production. The pru|dent parent will arre&s;t every native pa&s;|&s;ion, and direct its influence to the noble objects of education. The pa&s;&s;ion which females early di&s;cover for ornamental and &s;howy dre&s;s may be made an u&s;eful en|gine for teaching indu&s;try, economy, ta&s;te,

and cleanline&s;s. A little girl will &s;pare no pains, nor think the time long, which is employed in dre&s;&s;ing and undre&s;&s;ing her doll; in making and adorning this idol of her fancy. But, in order to have it properly formed and attired, &s;he is obliged to have frequent recour&s;e to oth|ers for a&s;&s;i&s;tance: this affords the mother, or the elder &s;i&s;ters, where there are &s;eve|ral daughters, an opportunity to commu|nicate u&s;eful in&s;truction in a mo&s;t plea&s;|ing manner. The little arti&s;t will li&s;ten to every propo&s;al for altering, amending, and beautifying it: &s;he receives any in|&s;truction &s;he can obtain as a favor: &s;he will work with indefatigable indu&s;try to complete the object of her wi&s;hes, and u&s;e great economy in &s;aving all the &s;hreds which fall from the &s;ci&s;&s;ors. But &s;he would be more happy, if le&s;s dependent: &s;he endeavors, therefore, to become mi&s;|tre&s;s of the bu&s;ine&s;s, that &s;he may enjoy the undivided &s;atisfaction of making and dre&s;&s;ing her image.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="022570_0324_0FB990520314F4A8">WHILE her mamma and Fanny were teaching Rozella the art of making the requi&s;ite articles of dre&s;s for her doll, they were communicating knowledge to her, not as a ta&s;k but as a favor, which was u&s;eful thro life.

<P>THOSE who are not engaged in dome&s;tic education, or have no concern in the in&s;truction and government of families, may think a minute detail of childi&s;h matters frivolous and unnece&s;&s;a|ry; but the thoughtful, anxious, and af|fectionate mother, who is immediately oc|cupied in dome&s;tic education, has very different ideas. She is perpetually &s;ur|rounded with difficulties; is anxious for a minute detail of particulars in the proc|e&s;s of education. She wi&s;hes not only to know wherein &s;he is wrong, but to have every particular track pointed out which will lead to the great object in view, the good of her children. In this, the moth|er &s;hews le&s;s judgment than &s;olicitude. To give in&s;tances and explanations which will apply to every ca&s;e, would exceed the bounds of any compo&s;itions on the &s;ubject of education. As education mu&s;t be conducted by improving incidents and occa&s;ions, &s;o the con&s;iderate mother will
<PB N="29" REF="022570_0326_0FB99054F9C1EB50">
&s;eize general principles, and improve in|&s;tances and examples, by &s;imilitude or analogy.</P>
<P>THE object Mrs. Bloom&s;grove had principally in view, in the education of her daughter, was to make it proper for her &s;ex; to in&s;pire her with the love of tho&s;e occupations which are their pecu|liar province; to in&s;truct her in that mode&s;t una&s;&s;uming air, which be&s;t be|comes her &s;ex; and to make her ac|quainted with tho&s;e things, which will make her the mo&s;t u&s;eful and happy in life. To the&s;e ends &s;he avails her&s;elf of opportunities and incidents as they oc|cur.</P>
<P>IT &s;hould be con&s;idered that in this country, marriages generally take place earlier than in older countries; and, from the circum&s;tances of the people, the mi&s;tre&s;s of the family mu&s;t be at the head of her dome&s;tic affairs. The term allotted, by this u&s;age, for the education of females, being &s;hort, it &s;hould be im|proved with the more diligence. Not

attending &s;ufficiently to the difference of circum&s;tances between our own country, and that, from which we have been too long accu&s;tomed implicitly to borrow our maxims and manners, many parents have laid the foundation of great dome&s;tic dif|ficulty and wretchedne&s;s by mi&s;manage|ment in the education of their daughters. Deluded by romantic ideas of elegance and &s;plendor, borrowed from European writers, cu&s;toms, and manners, many have copied them in the education of their children, without making proper allow|ances for the difference which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts in the &s;tate of &s;ociety and government of the two countries.</P>
<P>DAUGHTERS born to expectations, as it is phra&s;ed, have had their minds &s;well|ed with vanity, from an idea of their own con&s;equence on that account; and felt them&s;elves above the drudgery of learn|ing the nece&s;&s;ary parts of dome&s;tic duties. Their education, proceeding on the &s;up|po&s;ition of a certain inheritance, has con|&s;i&s;ted mo&s;tly in the arts of dre&s;s, mu&s;ic,
<PB N="31" REF="022570_0328_0FB99062816550A8">
dancing, paying and receiving vi&s;its, and the graces of an a&s;&s;embly room; while very little attention has been paid either to the head or heart&mdash;&s;till le&s;s to the u&s;e|ful branches of dome&s;tic economy. Oth|ers of le&s;s e&s;tates, but not le&s;s vanity, have followed on in full career. What kind of wives the&s;e have made, you may read in the &s;hattered fortunes of many indu&s;|trious hu&s;bands, who have been caught by the waving plumage.</P>
<P>WHETHER this would be a proper mode of education, if e&s;tates were as &s;ure and durable as the everla&s;ting mountains, I am not about to inquire&mdash;I think it will not bear a que&s;tion. But when we con&s;ider that in a free country, under a republican form of government, indu&s;try is the only &s;ure road to wealth; and economy the only &s;ure means of pre&s;erving it, we &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of educating females in a manner &s;uited to the genius of the gov|ernment. It is an old adage, "A man mu&s;t a&s;k his wife, whether he may be rich." He gets the e&s;tate by his indu&s;|try:

&s;he pre&s;erves it by her economy. If &s;he has no economy, he labors in vain. The want of attention to this branch of female education, has poi&s;oned the happi|ne&s;s and ruined the circum&s;tances of ma|ny families. I know &s;everal females, who&s;e only boa&s;t has been that they were never taught to do any labor, and that they never did any work in their lives. They are now old; and have nothing to boa&s;t of, but extreme poverty, without the power of remedying their circum|&s;tances.</P>

<P>I DO not mean to &s;peak &s;lightly of the polite and graceful accompli&s;hments; but to &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity of uniting to them, the knowledge and habits of do|me&s;tic duties. Her own hou&s;e is the place for a lady to &s;hine in. The &s;howy accompli&s;hments will appear advantage|ou&s;ly abroad; but dome&s;tic qualities,

like the <HI>robe de chambre</HI> are of con&s;tant u&s;e: without the&s;e a lady mu&s;t make an awkward figure at home, however grace|ful &s;he may appear abroad. She may grace an a&s;&s;embly room, but do no honor to her&s;elf at the head of a table. Her parlour may appear neat and in order, but her kitchen like that of a &s;lattern. Her own dre&s;s may be a proper a&s;&s;em|blage of materials to adorn her per&s;on; but the education of her children, a re|proach to her dome&s;tic character.</P>
<P>AS the portrait painter &s;hould never &s;uffer an unfini&s;hed piece to go out of his hands, &s;o a mother &s;hould never give her daughter in marriage, till &s;he is quali|fied to fulfil the vow, of being "a true and faithful wife." After &s;uch an en|gagement, in the pre&s;ence of her mother, who has had the care of her education, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to have qualified her for the &s;tation to which &s;he pre&s;ents her; what mu&s;t be the mortification of her hu&s;band, when he finds her wanting in almo&s;t every part of dome&s;tic knowledge?
<PB N="34" REF="022570_0331_0FB9907020B16280">
This di&s;appointment is a fruitful &s;ource of dome&s;tic animo&s;ities, when family cares increa&s;e and multiply. This want of knowledge in the duties of her &s;tation be|comes the occa&s;ion of many difficulties with &s;ervants. The mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e being unacquainted with their duties, cannot judge of the merits of their &s;ervice; expects too much from them, and makes too little allowance for the feelings attend|ant on human nature.</P>
<P>IF pro&s;pects of intere&s;t could have ex|cu&s;ed any one from attending to the&s;e concerns, Rozella might have pleaded an exemption. But her mamma, who knew the importance of this kind of knowledge, determined to depart from the too com|mon cu&s;tom of educating daughters. "I con&s;ider," &s;he &s;aid to a friend, who had ob&s;erved to her that he could not conceive the nece&s;&s;ity there was for her daughter to labor&mdash;"I con&s;ider that a|mong the events which may attend her future days, poverty is a po&s;&s;ible event. Should any unfore&s;een occurrence render

it inevitable, &s;he will now be prepared for the wor&s;t, and provided with a reme|dy. If the &s;un of pro&s;perity &s;hould &s;hine upon her, &s;till, at its meridian &s;plendor, this will be u&s;eful to her; &s;he will be a better wife, a better mi&s;tre&s;s, and a better woman, in every view, and in every rela|tion."</P>
<P>I HAVE already ob&s;erved that &s;he ac|cu&s;tomed her daughter to be always en|gaged in &s;ome employment; and as far as po&s;&s;ible, made her amu&s;ements &s;ub&s;er|vient to the great objects of education. At the age of twelve, &s;he had become ac|quainted with &s;everal branches of cook|ery, under&s;tood the compo&s;ition and pro|portions of pa&s;try, and even before that period, &s;he could a&s;&s;i&s;t her mamma in do|ing the honors of the table. This made her ambitious to ri&s;e above childi&s;h toys. At that age, &s;he was intru&s;ted with the in&s;pection of &s;ome parts of the hou&s;e; with the adju&s;tment of the parlour for the reception of company; of the lodging rooms, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Fanny, who
<PB N="36" REF="022570_0333_0FB990798B29BA20">
was better able to judge whether every thing was in proper order to receive their gue&s;ts. In this re&s;pect Fanny was of no &s;mall advantage to her; for to her was committed the care of things which were of too great magnitude for Rozella, who was to a&s;&s;i&s;t Fanny, and to have the whole charge of them, as &s;oon as &s;he &s;hould be able to receive it. This confidential com|mitment of affairs, according to the &s;ev|eral &s;tages of ability and merit, gave a con&s;tant &s;pring to improvement and fidel|ity.</P>
<P>TOO much pains cannot be taken on this head, &s;ince the mo&s;t of our time, and e&s;pecially that of a female, is to be pa&s;&s;ed at home; and &s;ince the pro&s;perity and happine&s;s of the whole depend on the ability and di&s;po&s;ition of each member to di&s;charge the duties of her particular &s;ta|tion. If the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e, who holds the fir&s;t place in all the economical concerns within it, is unacquainted with the duties of &s;o important a place, the or|der of things mu&s;t be broken in upon,

<P>YOU will not conclude, my dear &s;ir, from any thing which has been &s;aid, that Rozella's time was wholly occupied in dome&s;tic concerns, or that the&s;e were im|po&s;ed as a daily ta&s;k. Her attention to the&s;e was granted as a favor; and it was made to yield to other improvements. "You can be u&s;eful to me, &s;aid Mrs. Bloom&s;grove, by attending to the&s;e things, and by alleviating the burden of the &s;erv|ants, who, you &s;hould recollect, are of the &s;ame &s;pecies with your&s;elf: they will love you and think labor more honorable for your taking a part in it, and will do it with more cheerfulne&s;s."</P>
<P>THE time which was &s;pent in dome&s;tic occupations, was far from being lo&s;t in the view of a poli&s;hed education. It rather facilitates than impedes progre&s;s in knowledge and polite literature. It fur|ni&s;hes

many opportunities for putting in|to practice the u&s;eful parts of knowledge, and of practi&s;ing many civilities, which become e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;y and graceful by u&s;e only. Another advantage flowing from tho&s;e dome&s;tic exerci&s;es is, it prevents too great a degree of effeminacy, and inures to a little hardine&s;s, which is requi&s;ite for oth|er rea&s;ons than the pre&s;ervation of the health. The delicate and effeminate manner, in which many females are fo&s;|tered when young, de&s;troys their health, deprives them of the power of enjoying life, and entails on po&s;terity enervated con&s;titutions.</P>
<P>HENCE mo&s;t writers on education bring up to view, the Spartan and Roman young ladies mixing with the young men in mil|itary games, wre&s;tling, and other violent exerci&s;es. This practice was &s;aid to have been introduced with a view of rendering the female con&s;titution healthy and ro|bu&s;t, that their &s;tates might never be wanting in well nerved &s;ons for defence at

home, or for carrying on their military operations abroad. But the&s;e exerci&s;es &s;eem to me too athletic, to have the force of example upon our ladies, who do not wi&s;h their &s;ons to be &s;oldiers, nor their daughters wre&s;tlers. All that is nece&s;&s;ary for health, is plain food, with frequent exerci&s;e. Engli&s;h females far exceed tho&s;e in this country in the exerci&s;e of walking.

<HEAD>LETTER LVIII.</HEAD>
<P>MUCH has been &s;aid by Rou&s;&s;eau and others on the &s;ubject of the &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion of women. If by the term, they mean to expre&s;s any inferiority of &s;pecies, or a &s;urrender of any natural rights, there cannot be any ground in nature, or any rea&s;on in &s;ociety, for the odious idea. If they mean that women &s;hould &s;ubmit to the caprice of man's will, becau&s;e of his &s;uperior &s;trength, then they are pri&s;oners at di&s;cretion; which is an idea equally dete&s;table. But if nothing more is in|tended by it, than that delicate mode&s;ty which is a dictate of female nature, and the effect of con&s;cious weakne&s;s, which leads them to look to men as their pro|tectors; it will be the delight of every &s;en&s;ible woman to exerci&s;e her daughter in the habits of it. No woman of under|&s;tanding, or of goodne&s;s, would attempt to &s;ubvert the order of nature, and train her daughter to ma&s;culine &s;entiments and manners. There is no decent woman
<PB N="44" REF="022570_0341_0FB99094762C0AC0">
but would be mortified at having it &s;aid &s;he ruled her hu&s;band, e&s;pecially if it was true. To have it &s;aid, that &s;he has a complai&s;ant hu&s;band, is the pride of every woman; as it is of every hu&s;band to have it &s;aid of his wife, that &s;he has all that &s;en&s;ibility of heart, that delicacy of &s;entiment, and pliability of manners which belong to her &s;ex.</P>
<P>IN order that the voice of nature may be obeyed; that the mode&s;ty and delica|cy which is the glory of the &s;ex, and the palladium of virtue, may be pre&s;erved, it is nece&s;&s;ary that females be habituated to re&s;traint. This will be an unavoidable attendant of female life; and without it they cannot pre&s;erve con&s;i&s;tency of char|acter.</P>
<P>I FIND it difficult to expre&s;s my&s;elf with clearne&s;s and preci&s;ion on this part of the &s;ubject. I beg leave to advance under the &s;tandard of Lord Kaimes and Rou&s;&s;eau. "Women, &s;ays the fir&s;t, de&s;|tined by nature to be obedient," (to be under re&s;traint, I think, would have ex|pre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="45" REF="022570_0342_0FB9909BDAE0C490">
the idea better) "ought to be di&s;ciplined early to bear wrongs without murmuring. This is a hard le&s;&s;on; and yet it is nec|e&s;&s;ary even for their own &s;akes." "The perver&s;ene&s;s and ill nature of the women only &s;erve to aggravate their own misfor|tunes, and the mi&s;conduct of their hu&s;|bands; they might plainly perceive that &s;uch are not the arms by which they gain the &s;uperiority."</P>
<P>"SULLENNESS or peevi&s;hne&s;s, &s;ay both, may alienate the hu&s;band, but tend not to &s;ooth his roughne&s;s, nor to moderate his impetuo&s;ity. Heaven did not be&s;tow on them the powers of in&s;inuation, to make them perver&s;e and moro&s;e; it did not con&s;titute them feeble, to make them im|perious; it did not give them &s;o &s;oft and agreeable a voice, to vent abu&s;e; nor fea|tures &s;o delicate and lovely, to be disfigur|ed with anger."</P>
<P>BUT after all, &s;ays the NOBLE writer, "has nature dealt &s;o partially with her children, as to be&s;tow on one &s;ex ab&s;olute authority, leaving nothing to the other
<PB N="46" REF="022570_0343_0FB9909D08709560">
ab&s;olute &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion? This indeed has the appearance of great partiality. But has a woman no influence over her hu&s;band? I an&s;wer, providence has provided her with means to rule over his will. He governs by law, &s;he by per&s;ua&s;ion; nor can her influence ever fail, if &s;upported by &s;weetne&s;s of temper and zeal to make him happy."</P>
<P>ROUSSEAU charmingly &s;ays&mdash;"Hers is a &s;overeignty founded on complacence and addre&s;s: care&s;&s;es are her orders; tears, her menaces. She governs in a family as a mini&s;ter does in the &s;tate, pro|curing commands to be laid upon her, for doing what &s;he inclines to do." And adds&mdash;"When they give way to rage, therefore, they forget them&s;elves, for tho they may often have rea&s;on to complain, they are always in the wrong to SCOLD.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>"RENDS with tremendous &s;ounds your ears a&s;under,</L>

on the woman's &s;ide will always bring a man back to rea&s;on, if he be not ab&s;olutely a brute, and will &s;ooner or later triumph over him."</P>
<P>THE influence of females over the man|ners of the world is &s;ufficiently great and exten&s;ive. It is only to be wi&s;hed that their education might be &s;uch, as to direct that power to the be&s;t purpo&s;es. "That little boy you &s;ee there, &s;aid Themi&s;tocles, is the arbiter of all Greece: for he gov|erns his mother; his mother rules me; I, the Athenians; and the Athenians, all the other Greeks."</P>
<P>SUBMISSION in females does not there|fore imply the lea&s;t &s;ervility of obedience to capricious men, but only an acquie&s;|cence in the con&s;titution of nature, which, having formed them of finer materials, renders them more feeble in habit, more &s;u&s;ceptible in heart, and more complacent in manners. With the&s;e arms nature has furni&s;hed them for defence at every point. When they employ the&s;e, they follow nature, and &s;ucce&s;s attends them. But
<PB N="48" REF="022570_0345_0FB990A6C69E3AA8">
when they commence ho&s;tilities, and com|mit the deci&s;ion to the event of the field, they mu&s;t &s;urrender pri&s;oners at di&s;cre|tion.</P>
<P>TO cheri&s;h this &s;oftne&s;s, pliability, and power of &s;elf re&s;traint, is one great object of female education. It is under her mother's tuition, and from her example, that a young lady acquires the knowledge of what properly con&s;titutes the female character, and the habits of re&s;traint. Rozella is all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to her mamma, without the u&s;e of any &s;everity. She is mode&s;t but not ba&s;hful; is &s;prightly and tractable, but not unhappy under re|&s;traint. In her mamma &s;he &s;ees a con|&s;tant example of tho&s;e dome&s;tic qualities, which are requi&s;ite to conjugal and do|me&s;tic enjoyment; that her inferiority in point of &s;trength is amply compen&s;ated in the commanding gentlene&s;s of her man|ners; that her empire is attendant on her virtues. She reigns triumphant in the mildne&s;s of her di&s;po&s;ition, and her mod|e&s;ty renders her &s;way ab&s;olute. It is in
<PB N="49" REF="022570_0346_0FB990ADF48EE908">
this way that nature has provided a bal|ance of power between the &s;exes.</P>

<P>THE evening was overca&s;t; and the &s;oft murmur of expiring day had in|duced Fanny to the window, that &s;he might enjoy the cheerful note of a mu&s;ic|al tru&s;h, &s;weetly warbling in a neighbor|ing grove. A plea&s;ing melancholy &s;ooth|ed and harmonized all her feelings, and rai&s;ed her grateful heart to him who&s;e prai&s;e it &s;ung. While meek eyed con|templation &s;oft effu&s;ed its balmy influence over her gentle &s;pirit, a &s;tranger called with a large packet, which he &s;aid he was to deliver there, and went directly away. Fanny, who &s;uppo&s;ed it to contain &s;ome papers from Mr. Bloom&s;grove, who was then at the general a&s;&s;embly, &s;at down to enjoy the reverie which had been inter|rupted by the incident. Mrs. Bloom&s;|grove, who had been occupied in &s;ome
<PB N="50" REF="022570_0347_0FB990AFC1FDAC90">
dome&s;tic concerns, hearing &s;omebody at the door, ordered a candle into the room where Fanny was &s;itting&mdash;Judge, my dear &s;ir, what mu&s;t have been her &s;ur|pri&s;e, when &s;he &s;aw the budget was di|rected to her! She read the letter with avidity. It was from her twin &s;i&s;ter Con&s;tantia; of whom, as I have had no occa&s;ion to &s;peak till this time, I &s;hall on|ly &s;ay: She is &s;en&s;ible without o&s;tenta|tion; tall without elegance; agreeable without beauty; amiable without a di&s;|play of virtues, and admired without a fortune.</P>
<P>HAVING read the letter, which contain|ed many family matters with which we have no concern at this time; &s;he per|ceived that the books, contained in the budget, were a pre&s;ent from her brother Edward, who was then in England. The books &s;he unfolded, and opening one of them, &s;he &s;aw at the head of a &s;ection, the complaint of a female concerning the in|&s;en&s;ibility of men to the charms of a fe|male mind cultivated with polite and &s;olid
<PB N="51" REF="022570_0348_0FB990B2C96FE0D8">
learning. The piece drew her attention; and &s;he &s;at down and read it. Ju&s;t as &s;he had done it, Mrs. Bloom&s;grove and Rozella came into the room. Fanny read to them the letter, which was very affectionate, and clo&s;ed with many re&s;pect|ful compliments for the family. After &s;ome conver&s;ation &s;ugge&s;ted by the letter, Fanny related what &s;he had been reading, which was in &s;ub&s;tance as follows.</P>
<P>A YOUNG lady, who was the daughter of a gentleman of literature, having lo&s;t, her mother when &s;he was very young, was educated by her father. As he lived in a &s;olitary village and had lei&s;ure, he devot|ed much of his time to her; and, being fond of cla&s;&s;ical learning him&s;elf, he in|troduced her into an acquaintance with &s;everal languages. The attention &s;he had paid to the&s;e (I &s;uppo&s;e) made her neg|lect &s;ome more agreeable and u&s;eful im|provements; for &s;he complained that &s;he did not meet a very favorable recep|tion in company. As &s;he was very learn|ed and wrote poetry well, &s;he thought it
<PB N="52" REF="022570_0349_0FB990B60D413040">
beneath her to attend to dre&s;s and the et|iquette of the polite world. Tho &s;he was ver&s;ed in the &s;ciences, and had been taught mu&s;ic and even dancing, yet &s;he was unver&s;ed in dome&s;tic &s;cience. "She can make ver&s;es, &s;aid the gentlemen wit|tily; but give me the woman who can make a pudding." She complained that after all her improvements, and her en|deavors to prevent them from becoming invidious, &s;he was avoided by her own &s;ex, and treated with the cold formality of con&s;trained civilities by the gentle|men.</P>
<P>WHEN Fanny had fini&s;hed, the con|ver&s;ation turned upon the pedantry of &s;ome of the female literati, in which many &s;mart things were &s;aid by the young ladies, as well as by Mrs. Bloom&s;grove, who gracefully de&s;cended to their plea&s;antries on this occa&s;ion. After a little diver&s;ion at the expen&s;e of a certain de&s;cription of LEARNED ladies, &s;he re&s;umed her u&s;ual &s;erenity and dignity in conver&s;ing with her family; and availed her&s;elf of the
<PB N="53" REF="022570_0350_0FB990BC36A015C8">
occa&s;ion to make many judicious remarks on female propriety, and on the true ex|cellence of the female character. To her own ob&s;ervations &s;he added many anec|dotes u&s;eful and entertaining, &s;ome of which I will offer for your peru&s;al in my next.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER LX.</HEAD>
<P>YOU will not expect that I &s;hall give a particular detail of the evening's conver&s;ation; nor that I relate exactly and in order, all the particulars of Mrs. Bloom&s;grove's judicious and in&s;tructive ob&s;ervations. I &s;hall relate them as they occur.</P>
<P>THE path of life, on which you, my dear girls, are entering, is narrow, wind|ing, and intricate: you can &s;ee but little way in the devious cour&s;e, and therefore mu&s;t be watchful at every &s;tep you take. Life, in its be&s;t condition, is a mixed &s;tate: thorns growing with flowers attend
<PB N="54" REF="022570_0351_0FB990BFB12BD848">
our whole progre&s;s. But life is very much that to us which we make it to be. The condition of young females is pecu|liarly critical, and requires to be guarded by c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;tant circum&s;pection; but there are plea&s;ures peculiar to the female life, which, by maintaining their proper char|acter, will afford a full balance again&s;t all its difficulties.</P>
<P>THE dignity of that character con&s;i&s;ts in an equal mixture of re&s;erve with be|nevolence; of mode&s;ty with civility; of a &s;en&s;e of the refinement of female virtue, with a degree of prudence void of affecta|tion. Con&s;ider how tender a thing a woman's reputation is; how hard to pre|&s;erve; and, when lo&s;t, how much harder to recover; how frail many of the gifts you have received, and how dangerous mo&s;t of them; what mi&s;eries have been occa&s;ioned by an abu&s;e of them, and how great the acce&s;&s;ions of enjoyment in life by a proper u&s;e of them.</P>
<P>VANITY, a foible too incident to our &s;ex, is, if po&s;&s;ible, more ab&s;urd than in the
<PB N="55" REF="022570_0352_0FB990C317FD6F08">
other &s;ex. Men have bodily &s;trength, learning, power, and the like, to pride them&s;elves upon. Beauty is the only pe|culiar boa&s;t of a female; for virtue and good &s;en&s;e are never the &s;ubjects of van|ity. Again&s;t this folly it will be nece&s;&s;ary to guard, or it will grow with years, and become as obvious as it is di&s;gu&s;ting. Wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ever misfortune the want of beauty may be to a young lady, it is a greater misfortune to be vain of it.</P>
<P>I WILL give you an in&s;tance, my dear children, which will illu&s;trate my idea. "A youth from the country went to a neighboring fair, where were to be exhib|ited a number of foreign animals, as well tame and u&s;eful, as bea&s;ts of prey. An animal of uncommon &s;ize, but great ug|line&s;s, fir&s;t pre&s;ented it&s;elf to his a&s;toni&s;h|ed view. After &s;urveying the mon&s;ter, with great &s;urpri&s;e and &s;ome degree of fear, his attention was called to an animal of a beautiful and elegant form. When he had, for &s;ome time, contemplated the &s;moothne&s;s of its hair, the &s;ymmetry of
<PB N="56" REF="022570_0353_0FB990C4D20B6A50">
its limbs, and e&s;pecially the apparent &s;weetne&s;s of its countenance, he inquired of the keeper, the name of that beautiful animal; and whether he did no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> place it hy the &s;ide of that ugly creature, in order that it might &s;hine the more by the con|tra&s;t. The intelligent keeper admoni&s;h|ed the young man to be cautious not to be too ea&s;ily captivated with external ap|pearance. The animal which you &s;o much admire is called a tiger, and not|with&s;tanding his placid appearance, he is fierce and &s;avage beyond de&s;cription, and is an untameable bea&s;t of prey. But the one you de&s;pi&s;e, which is a camel, is a docile, affectionate animal, and highly u&s;eful to man."</P>
<P>YOU cannot but perceive, continued Mrs. Bloom&s;grove, that mere external beauty is of little worth, and that deformity, when a&s;&s;ociated with amiable di&s;po&s;itions and u&s;eful qualities, does not preclude our re&s;pect and approbation. I would not be under&s;tood to de&s;pi&s;e, or even un|dervalue beauty. Where it is the gift of
<PB N="57" REF="022570_0354_0FB990C8800C5440">
nature, we ought to value and cheri&s;h it, as we &s;hould all her other gifts. But if the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or &s;pends her mornings at the toilet, and under the hands of the fri&s;|eur; and her evenings in company, to di&s;play the additional beauty &s;he derives from adventitious ornaments, her mind mu&s;t be neglected, while her heart is cor|rupted by flattery and poi&s;oned by van|ity. They who live only to di&s;play a pretty face and a fine dre&s;s, can &s;carcely be ranked above an in&s;en&s;ible &s;tatue, or a painted image. A head without under|&s;tanding will always appear contemptible, whether it be covered with a cap or a wig.</P>
<P>A FEMALE, who plumes her&s;elf on her beauty, is in great danger of having her temper &s;oured by the apprehen&s;ion of flights and neglects with which &s;he meets. One in&s;tance of this will cancel a thou&s;and flatteries of profe&s;&s;ed admirers. The re|petition of them irritates the &s;pirits; and the mind, being awake to the lea&s;t ap|pearance of inattention, is &s;o often in a ferment, that &s;ourne&s;s of temper is the
<PB N="58" REF="022570_0355_0FB990D29DD16088">
con&s;equence. Sickline&s;s, fears, fal&s;e del|icacies, pride, affectation, and weakne&s;s of nerves, are incidents not uncommon to females of this &s;tamp. Finding them|&s;elves admired without &s;aying or doing any thing worthy of notice, they &s;ave them&s;elves the trouble of acquiring any valuable accompli&s;hments. A ta&s;te for reading and a habit of thinking would be too much trouble for them. But beauty is a ro&s;e that &s;oon withers. With the lo&s;s of that, they lo&s;e the power of plea&s;ing others; and, what is &s;till wor&s;e, po&s;&s;e&s;s not the power of plea&s;ing them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I HAVE, indeed, known very beautiful women, who have been educated with un|common care, both &s;en&s;ible and amiable. Their beauty was doubly valuable, when combined with a cultivated under&s;tand|ing, and the moral qualities of the heart. There are now to be found many in|&s;tances, which &s;hew to the world, that fe|males may po&s;&s;e&s;s beauty without vanity, and learning without pedantry.</P>

<P>THE next evening being very plea&s;|ant, they were induced by the &s;erenity of the &s;ky and the mildne&s;s of the &s;ea&s;on to walk in the &s;hrubbery. As they were re|peating &s;ome things which had pa&s;&s;ed the evening before, Mrs. Bloom&s;grove ob|&s;erved, that all &s;he had then &s;aid was veri|fied in the character of Catharina, Em|pre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia. In her were united vir|tue, with beauty; piety, with poverty; humility and great benevolence, with great pro&s;perity. Fanny joined with Rozella in earne&s;tly reque&s;ting her to re|peat her &s;tory; to which &s;he readily con|&s;ented. They repaired to the bowery; and being &s;eated where the moon &s;hone plea&s;antly upon them, &s;he related the fol|lowing part of her hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>"CATHARINA was born in a &s;mall city in Livonia, and heir to no other in|heritance than the virtues and frugality of her parents. Her father being dead, &s;he lived with her aged mother, in their
<PB N="60" REF="022570_0357_0FB990D7002DE218">
cottage covered with &s;traw; and both tho very poor, were very contented. Here, retired from the gaze of the world, by the labor of her hands &s;he &s;upported her par|ent, who was now incapable of &s;upporting her&s;elf. While Catharina &s;pun, the mother would &s;it by, and read &s;ome book of devotion: thus, when the fatigues of the day were over, both would &s;it down by their fire &s;ide, and enjoy the frugal meal with vacant fe&s;tivity.</P>
<P>"THO her face and per&s;on were models of perfection, yet her whole attention &s;eemed be&s;towed on her mind: her moth|er taught her to read, and an old Luther|an clergyman in&s;tructed her in the max|ims and duties of religion. Nature had furni&s;hed her not only with a ready, but a &s;olid turn of thought; not only with a &s;trong, but a right under&s;tanding. Such truly female accompli&s;hments procured her &s;everal &s;olicitations of marriage from the pea&s;ants of the country; but their of|fers were refu&s;ed, for &s;he loved her moth|er too tenderly to think of a &s;eparation.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="022570_0358_0FB990D858905480">"CATHARINA was fifteen, when her mother died: &s;he now, therefore, left her cottage, and went to live with the Luther|an mini&s;ter, by whom &s;he had been in|&s;tructed from her childhood.

to travel to Marienburgh, a city of great plenty.</P>
<P>"WITH her &s;canty wardrobe, packed up in a wallet, &s;he &s;et out on her journey on foot. She was to walk thro a region mi&s;erable by nature, but rendered &s;till more hideous by the Swedes and Ru&s;|&s;ians, who alternately plundered it at di&s;|cretion: but h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nger had taught her to de&s;pi&s;e the dangers of the way.</P>
<P>"ONE evening, upon her journey, as &s;he had entered a cottage by the way &s;ide, to take up her lodging for the night, &s;he was in&s;ulted by two Swedi&s;h &s;oldiers. They might, probably, have carried their in&s;ults into violence, had not a &s;ubaltern officer accidentally pa&s;&s;ing, come to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Upon his approach the &s;ol|diers immediately de&s;i&s;ted; but her thank|fulne&s;s was not greater than her &s;urpri&s;e, when &s;he in&s;tantly recollected in her de|liverer, the &s;on of the Lutheran mini&s;ter, her former in&s;tructor, benefactor, and friend.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="022570_0360_0FB990E1472DAD50">"THIS was an happy interview for Catharina: the little &s;tock of money &s;he had brought from home, was by this time quite exhau&s;ted; her clothes were gone piece by piece, in order to &s;atisfy tho&s;e who entertained her in their hou&s;es. Her generous countryman parted with what he could &s;pare, to buy her clothes; fur|ni&s;hed her with an hor&s;e, and gave her letters of recommendation to a faithful friend of his father, who was then &s;uper|intendant of Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">burgh.</P>
<P>"OUR beautiful &s;tranger had only to appear, to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> well received: &s;he was im|mediately admitted into the &s;uperintend|ant's family, as governe&s;s to his two daughters; and tho yet but &s;eventeen, &s;hewed her&s;elf capable of in&s;tructing her &s;ex, not only in virtue, but politene&s;s. Such was her good &s;en&s;e and beauty, that her ma&s;ter him&s;elf, in a &s;hort time, offered her his hand, which, to his great &s;urpri&s;e, &s;he thought proper to refu&s;e.

tho he had lo&s;t an arm, and was otherwi&s;e disfigured in the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>"IN order, therefore, to prevent fur|ther &s;olicitations from others, as &s;oon as the officer came to town upon duty, &s;he offered him her per&s;on, which he accept|ed with tran&s;port, and their nuptials were &s;olemnized according to cu&s;tom. But all the lines of her fortune were to be &s;triking. The very day on which they were married, the Ru&s;&s;ians laid &s;iege to Marienburgh: the unhappy &s;oldier had no time to enjoy the well earned plea&s;ures of the connubial &s;tate: he was immediate|ly called off to an attack, from which he was never after &s;een to return.</P>
<P>"IN the mean time the &s;iege went on with fury, aggravated on one &s;ide by ob|&s;tinacy, on the other by revenge. This war between the two northern powers at that time was truly barbarous. The in|nocent pea&s;ant, and the harmle&s;s virgin often &s;hared the fate of the &s;oldier in arms. Marienburgh was taken by a&s;&s;ault; and &s;uch was the fury of the a&s;&s;ailants,

that not only the garri&s;on, but almo&s;t all the inhabitants, men, women, and child|ren, were put to the &s;word. At length, when the carnage was pretty well over, Catharina was found hid in an oven.</P>
<P>"SHE had hitherto been poor, but free; &s;he was now to conform to her hard fate, and learn what it was to be a &s;lave: in this &s;ituation, however, &s;he behaved with piety and humility; and tho misfor|tunes had abated her vivacity, yet &s;he was cheerful. The fame of her merit and re&s;ignation reached even the Prince Menzikoff, the Ru&s;&s;ian general: he de|&s;ired to &s;ee her&mdash;was &s;truck with her beauty&mdash;bought her of the &s;oldier, her ma&s;ter, and placed her under the di|rection of his own &s;i&s;ter.

<P>"SHE had not been long in this &s;itua|tion, when Peter the Great paying the Prince a vi&s;it, Catharina happened to come in with &s;ome dry fruits, which &s;he

<P>"HE had been forced, when young, to marry from motives of intere&s;t; he was now re&s;olved to marry pur&s;uant to his own inclinations. He immediately in|quired the hi&s;tory of this fair Livonian, who was not yet eighteen. He traced her thro the vale of ob&s;curity, thro all the vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune, and found her truly great in them all. The meanne&s;s of her birth was no ob&s;truction to his de&s;ign.

"He went one Sunday to church, at the di&s;tance of more than two hours ride. The clergyman of the pari&s;h invited him to dinner, but Swift excu&s;ed him&s;elf by &s;aying it was too far to ride home afterwards; no, I &s;hall dine with my neighbor Reilly, at Virginy, which is half way home. Reilly, who was there called a gentleman farmer, was proud of the honor, and immediately &s;ent a me&s;|&s;enger to his wife to prepare for the re|ception of &s;o extraordinary a gue&s;t. She dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf in her be&s;t apparel; the &s;on put on his new &s;uit, and his &s;ilver laced hat adorned his head. When the lady was introduced to the Dean, he &s;a|luted

her with the &s;ame air, as if &s;he had been a dutche&s;s, making &s;everal congees down to the ground, and then handed her with great formality to her &s;eat.</P>
<P>"AFTER &s;ome polite compliments, he addre&s;&s;ed his ho&s;t&mdash;'Mr. Reilly, I &s;up|po&s;e you have a con&s;iderable e&s;tate here; let us go and look over your deme&s;ne.'

It may be &s;uppo&s;ed that the family was put into no &s;mall confu&s;ion at this &s;trange proceeding; but they did not dare &s;hew that they took any umbrage at it, as the pre&s;ence of Dr. Swift &s;truck every one with uncommon awe, who was not well acquainted with him.</P>

<P>YOU &s;ee, my dear children, the &s;enti|ments which gentlemen of abilities and di&s;tinction entertain of affectation. All attempts to plea&s;e by an appearance, or by manners which do not properly belong to us, are not only lo&s;t, but become the occa&s;ion of raillery and contempt. Who|ever &s;eeks admiration and applau&s;e by means of affectation, acts as wi&s;e a part as the female, who, &s;eeking after beauty, de|&s;troys her real complexion and her health by artificial paints. I have &s;een ladies, in public places, of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite forms, render them&s;elves perfectly ridiculous by a conceited and affected air, a &s;impering &s;mile, or a general air of di&s;dain. Tho&s;e ladies, who might, by a mode&s;t and truly female behavior, have com|manded univer&s;al admiration, became the di&s;gu&s;t of the company, and the
<PB N="75" REF="022570_0372_0FB99115C3B71C60">
&s;ubject of ridicule in every circle af|terwards.</P>
<P>AFFECTATION in men is bad enough, but in women, who&s;e conduct &s;hould al|ways be ea&s;y and proper, it is much wor&s;e. Indeed, added Mrs. Bloom&s;grove, it is generally owing to the other &s;ex that af|fectation appears in ours; for no woman can become completely fooli&s;h, or vicious, without their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and then they de&s;pi&s;e her for it.</P>
<P>AFFECTATION is that in manners which hypocri&s;y is in religion&mdash;an attempt to impo&s;e on others by an appearance of qualities which we do not po&s;&s;e&s;s. We cannot pay our&s;elves a wor&s;e compliment than by affectation: it is a tacit acknowl|edgement that we ought to be what we are not. Like a ma&s;k, it may conceal our face; but is &s;till known to be a fal&s;e face. However common affectation may be, there is no failing more generally dete&s;t|ed, becau&s;e it is u&s;ed to hide all the other failings, and to di&s;play perfections to which we have no claim.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="022570_0373_0FB9911741D8B3B8">THIS is a folly incident to youth, but not confined to that age. It is generally worn off by age, and by an acquaintance with the world. It is always di&s;gu&s;tful, not only becau&s;e unnatural, but becau&s;e it indicates a trifling vanity of mind. It u&s;ually ari&s;es from a fondne&s;s to imitate &s;ome one who is admired for &s;uperior ac|compli&s;hments. But it is blind and un|di&s;cerning, and adopts the infirmities and defects of the per&s;on admired, as readily as the beauties and the graces.</P>

of any. In conver&s;ation &s;he is al|ways entertaining. She is companiona|ble, but never loquacious, or a&s;&s;uming. She can be humorous, without departing from innocence, or the delicacy of her &s;ex; witty, without ridiculing religion, or a&s;per&s;ing characters. She never morti|fies any one in her company, by a &s;eeming indifference to what they &s;ay, nor offends any by direct contradiction; &s;he rather in&s;inuates, than impo&s;es her &s;entiments upon tho&s;e with whom &s;he conver&s;es.

She is but little acquaint|ed with books, and le&s;s with the world. She is thought, by &s;ome, to be a beauty, but few think her plea&s;ing; &s;he is tall and
<PB N="78" REF="022570_0375_0FB9912278CC6F90">
&s;traight, but not of a comely form; &s;he is not without animation, but is not engag|ing; and yet &s;he affects to be all this and more. Without a fund for conver&s;ation, &s;he &s;ays much, but little to the purpo&s;e. She u&s;es bad grammar, and a wor&s;e &s;tyle; engro&s;&s;es the conver&s;ation in company, and will venture upon any &s;ubject, becau&s;e &s;he thinks to imitate, and even excel, A|delina. A&s;pa&s;ia affects wit&mdash;politene&s;s may induce &s;ome of the gentlemen to force a &s;mile, but no one laughs at it: this &s;he a&s;cribes to any other cau&s;e rather than the want of &s;martne&s;s in her witti|ci&s;ms. A&s;pa&s;ia might pa&s;s for an agree|able companion, if &s;he would act her&s;elf, and not affect to be &s;omething more than &s;he really is. She would never appear to be de&s;titute of wit or good &s;en&s;e, if &s;he had enough of either to prevent forced attempts to di&s;play them.</P>
<P>"MAMMA, &s;aid Rozella, why do not &s;ome of her friends tell her how &s;uch af|fectation appears to others, and break her of it?" It is not ea&s;y, my dear, replied
<PB N="79" REF="022570_0376_0FB991242129E610">
Mrs. Bloom&s;grove, to break off bad hab|its; and be&s;ides, &s;he might only attribute it to envy, if any one was to mention it to her; for nothing is more difficult than to make people &s;ee their own errors, e&s;pec|ially if they have much vanity. Do you, my dear, avoid affectation as you would a &s;iren. Nothing conduces more to ren|der a per&s;on agreeable, than ea&s;y and graceful manners. That our manners, may be graceful, they mu&s;t be natural; for actions which are forced, are &s;tiff and awkward, and therefore di&s;gu&s;tful. Shun affectation therefore in all its odious forms; a&s;&s;ume no borrowed airs; and be content to plea&s;e, to &s;hine, or to be u&s;eful, in the way which nature points out, and which rea&s;on approves.&mdash;Ju&s;t as Mrs. Bloom&s;grove had fini&s;hed the&s;e ob&s;erva|tions on affectation, which I think you will allow were judicious, the nephew re|turned from a neighboring county, whith|er he had been to tran&s;act &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s of his own.

<P>THE next day, being on a vi&s;it at Mr. &mdash;'s where a large number of la|dies were collected, they were entertained by the conver&s;ation of Mi&s;s &mdash;, a lady who had been &s;ome years out of her teens, but had not lo&s;t the power of &s;peech. This lady had been a great reader; but her reading had not furni&s;hed her with the mo&s;t u&s;eful knowledge, nor the &s;ound|e&s;t judgment. Her conver&s;ation con&s;i&s;ted of &s;uch materials, as are to be found in books written merely to amu&s;e the mind, without in&s;tructing it; to vacate the pa&s;&s;ing hour, without leaving one u&s;eful

impre&s;&s;ion. Shady groves and purling &s;treams, fa&s;hions, etiquette, and romantic &s;cenes of love and high life, filled up the mighty void, and wa&s;ted the afternoon.</P>
<P>AS this lady was a &s;tranger, lately arrived from the capital on a vi&s;it, the inconveni|ence of her perpetual motion was endured with that fortitude and calmne&s;s which true politene&s;s in&s;pired. But the clo&s;e of the day was far from being; the lea&s;t agreeable part of it. To a woman of Mrs. Bloom&s;|grove's clear under&s;tanding and &s;olid judgment, nothing could have appeared more in&s;ipid: &s;he was glad, therefore, to retire at as early an hour, as &s;he could with propriety. The young ladies, who had been mute mo&s;t of the time during the vi&s;it, recovered the power of &s;peech, as &s;oon as they returned. Tho Mrs. Bloom&s;grove never allowed them in the u&s;e of any &s;candal; nor did &s;he common|ly permit them to make any remarks to the di&s;advantage of any one of the company they had left, yet on this occa&s;ion &s;he in|dulged them in a few liberties of &s;peech
<PB N="82" REF="022570_0379_0FB9912AC2EA8560">
on "the elegance of the conver&s;a|tion" with which they had been enter|tained.</P>
<P>FINDING them&s;elves once more a&s;&s;em|bled in their own circle, Mrs. Bloom&s;|grove renewed the conver&s;ation which had been interrupted the evening before, in the following manner&mdash;I was going on to ob&s;erve, when your cou&s;in arrived la&s;t evening, and agreeably prevented my proceeding, that another thing which has a tendency to le&s;&s;en the excellence of the female character, and render the minds of young ladies empty and vain, is the books they read, and the manner in which they &s;pend their time. Nothing can have a wor&s;e effect on the mind of our &s;ex, than the free u&s;e of tho&s;e writings which are the offspring of modern noveli&s;ts.

<P>IT has often been urged that a catalogue of books, &s;uitable for females, &s;hould be publi&s;hed; but it would be impo&s;&s;ible to give a li&s;t of books which would reach the object, on account of the great diver&s;ity in the de|grees of intellectual accompli&s;hment, at which they aim; (there being no profe&s;&s;ional &s;tandard) in the ca|pacities, opportunities, and encouragements they &s;ev|erally enjoy.

He has pointed out dangers and temptations which &s;eldom occur; and altho I doubt not that his novels were written with the pure&s;t intentions of pro|moting virtue, yet it is much to be feared whether the moral view is not lo&s;t by the youthful reader in tho&s;e love &s;cenes, which intere&s;t the pa&s;&s;ions more than the under|&s;tanding.

<P>THE &s;ame danger attends the works of Fielding. They will always be read with plea&s;ure, becau&s;e they exhibit a &s;eries of pictures drawn in a ma&s;terly manner; but they may corrupt a mind not well e&s;tab|li&s;hed

It is a great unhappine&s;s to a young woman to be de&s;titute of wi&s;e parents, or faithful friends, to direct her to the choice of proper books of amu&s;e|ment and entertainment. The little time which females can devote to reading, &s;hould be employed in the mo&s;t econom|ical manner in peru&s;ing tho&s;e books from which they may draw the mo&s;t, and the pure&s;t &s;entiments.</P>

How much more profitably might young females &s;pend their time in reading hi&s;tory, biog|raphy, travels, voyages, memoirs, and tho&s;e periodical pieces where the powers of wit, fancy, and judgment, have united in expo&s;ing vice and folly, &s;uch as the Spectator, and many other ingenious writers who have pur&s;ued the &s;ame track?

<P>PERSONAL qualities are of infi|nitely more con&s;equence, than tho&s;e which are merely adventitious, and tran&s;ient in their nature; &s;uch as beauty, dre&s;s, or any external embelli&s;hments. Fond mothers too often prefer beauty before every other qualification; and if their daughters are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that, dre&s;s is &s;tudied with great a&s;&s;iduity&mdash;vanity is in|&s;pired by flattery&mdash;but the more u&s;eful and durable qualities are neglected. Cornelia, daughter of Scipio the Great, and mother of the Roman Gracchi, who makes a di&s;tingui&s;hed figure in the hi&s;to|ry of Rome, was vi&s;ited by a lady of rank, who valued dre&s;s, and was remarkable for an elegant toilet.

In dre&s;s and ornaments, for Rozella, her mamma does not di&s;regard the fa&s;hion, but in&s;tructs her always to yield to pro|priety; a&s;&s;uring her, at the &s;ame time, that &s;implicity in dre&s;s, as well as man|ners, is mo&s;t becoming.</P>
<P>SHE takes her daughter into polite cir|cles; but enjoins upon her affability to|wards all cla&s;&s;es of people. When on a vi&s;it to her at the boarding &s;chool, &s;he ac|companies Rozella to the ball; but, to check that avidity for plea&s;ure which too often precipitates young girls into a round of di&s;&s;ipation, takes an opportunity to &s;hew her that &s;uch plea&s;ures are to be con&s;idered as mere amu&s;ement&mdash;unfit to

employ much of the time of a young woman, who is de&s;tined by nature to more important concerns&mdash;the care and govern|ment of a family.</P>
<P>IT was under the care of Mrs. &mdash;, that &s;he made great improvements in a graceful deportment and in the etiquette of the fa&s;hionable world. This lady was celebrated for her piety and good &s;en&s;e; and for her attention to the minds and morals of tho&s;e mi&s;&s;es who were commit|ted to her care. Rozella's parents were not willing to place her at any boarding &s;chool till they could find &s;uch an one; nor was &s;he placed under the care of Mrs. &mdash;, till &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed that giddy age at which mi&s;&s;es are too commonly &s;ent to &s;uch &s;chools, and before they have judg|ment to make the be&s;t u&s;e of the oppor|tunity for improvement. On this ac|count her preceptre&s;s was able to enlarge her mind, and regulate her heart, as well as embelli&s;h her manners; for reading the &s;criptures and books of u&s;eful knowledge, as well as works of ta&s;te and imagination,
<PB N="98" REF="022570_0395_0FB9916F5E00BD88">
made a part of the daily exerci&s;e of this &s;chool.</P>
<P>HAVING an exqui&s;itely fine ear for mu&s;ic, a ma&s;ter was provided to in&s;truct her in that plea&s;ing art. In a few months &s;he acquired a con&s;iderable know<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">edge of the theory, and, by practice, became a complete mi&s;tre&s;s of the bu&s;ine&s;s. Tho&s;e who have a great ta&s;te for mu&s;ic, I think, ought to be encouraged; but it is ridicul|ous for one who has neither voice nor ear to throw away that time in forcing nature, which might be &s;pent to more u&s;eful pur|po&s;es. I am acquainted with a lady, who has long been attended by a mu&s;ic ma&s;ter, at the enormous price u&s;ually &s;et on that &s;ervice, and has learned to touch every note by rule. I know another, who, nev|er having received any in&s;truction, but being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a fine ear for mu&s;ic, will play any tune after a few times hearing it. The artificial performance of the one will always give pain to the company, while the natural air of the other will never fail to communicate the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible delight.</P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="022570_0396_0FB99172C2283B18">VOCAL mu&s;ic may be more ea&s;ily ac|quired than in&s;trumental. This falls within the reach of mo&s;t people, and &s;hould be a part of the education of every female, as well to enable them "to &s;ooth the cares of dome&s;tic life," as "to join in that plea&s;ing part of public wor&s;hip which con&s;i&s;teth in p&s;almody." This was al&s;o a branch of in&s;truction at the boarding &s;chool, where Rozella acquired a thoro acquaintance with that cele&s;tial &s;cience.</P>
<P>DRAWING is al&s;o a plea&s;ing art, where there is a natural ta&s;te for it; and it is an accompli&s;hment not altogether u&s;ele&s;s; but without that ta&s;te, it ought never to be attempted. Neither the u&s;efulne&s;s of the art, nor the time or abilities of people in this country, will ju&s;tify its being a nec|e&s;&s;ary part of a polite education. Rozel|la having early di&s;covered a natural geni|us for drawing, was indulged with an op|portunity of gratifying her inclination.</P>
<P>I NEED not mention that dancing made a part of the in&s;truction of this &s;chool, nor that a young lady of Rozella's activity,
<PB N="100" REF="022570_0397_0FB98C966204B998">
di&s;tingui&s;hed her&s;elf at &s;o graceful an ex|erci&s;e. To be a good player is no index of mental faculties; it requires only a fine ear, with per&s;everance. But to dance with grace and expre&s;&s;ion, is an index of the mind; a certain dignity of mind is requi&s;ite, &s;upported by good &s;en&s;e: and be&s;ides, the general deportment and ge&s;t|ure will partake of the ea&s;y elegance which is thereby acquired. "Much time, how|ever, in teaching a girl to dance, is thrown away, if &s;he has not a pregnant genius: it is &s;ufficient that her motions be made ea&s;y to prevent her being awkward."</P>
<P>ROZELLA was to have &s;pent a few months longer at the &s;chool, but a circum|&s;tance of an intere&s;ting nature &s;uddenly called her home, and &s;he did not return to it any more. Fanny was &s;eized with a violent fever which threatened her life; and indeed it was wholly de&s;paired of by her phy&s;ician. Rozella was &s;ent for&mdash;&s;he flies with all &s;peed to her dear Fanny&mdash; was deluged in tears at &s;eeing her, and never left her bed &s;ide, until her &s;ymp|toms

became more favorable, which took place in about twenty four hours after her arrival. After a long confinement, &s;he was re&s;tored to health; but never lo&s;t the favorable impre&s;&s;ions which this near ap|proach to death made upon her mind.</P>
<P>THE &s;ickne&s;s which had left &s;uch good impre&s;&s;ions on Fanny's mind, gave them both a greater reli&s;h than ever for the &s;e|rene plea&s;ures of mental and moral im|provement.

<P>NOT many weeks have pa&s;&s;ed, &s;ince my amiable friend, whom I now addre&s;s, was, to all appearance, launching into the va&s;t, the unexplored world of &s;pirits. On my la&s;t vi&s;it, before the di&s;order formed a cri|&s;is, I had little doubt but that a few hours would have clo&s;ed your eyes forever upon all mortal things.&mdash;The &s;cene was tender &mdash;it was truly affecting! The grief of your friends was of that luxurious nature, which is crowned with hope, and can be under&s;tood by perception only.</P>
<P>I WISH not to give pain by recalling to your view, an event from which, thro the goodne&s;s of your heavenly Father, you have &s;o happily e&s;caped. Fain would I make a recollection of the whole &s;cene you &s;o lately pa&s;&s;ed thro both agreeable and beneficial, by exciting the plea&s;ing emo|tions of gratitude to heaven for the &s;atis|faction of mind you experienced in the

mo&s;t threatening moment, and for the health you now enjoy; and by offering a friendly hand to guide you thro the de|vious paths of youth in virtue's peaceful cour&s;e.</P>
<P>YOUR late experience evinces more than words can do, what is nece&s;&s;ary to render us happy in the mo&s;t trying con|dition to which our feeble nature is liable to be reduced. The books I this day put into your hand, will convince you of the importance of a public avowal of that re|ligion which your own experience has taught you is e&s;&s;ential to happine&s;s. Your con&s;picuous &s;ituation in life makes the ex|ample of it more to be de&s;ired, as its in|fluence would be more exten&s;ively felt.</P>
<P>AS I did not take the advantage of your weakne&s;s, and the alarming pro&s;pects of approaching di&s;&s;olution, to precipitate an entrance into the pale of the vi&s;ible church, when ju&s;t going to the church triumphant, I &s;hall be ju&s;tified in earne&s;tly enjoining upon the living, that incorporation with the church, which I could not think nec|e&s;&s;ary

By a public pro|fe&s;&s;ion of religion we &s;hew to the world our readine&s;s to comply externally with the commands of God; and by a living example of that religion, which is our on|ly con&s;olation when dying, we &s;hew our inward &s;en&s;e of its truth and excellence, and add our te&s;timony to its reality and importance.</P>
<P>TO make an open profe&s;&s;ion of our be|lief of the Chri&s;tian religion, of our regard to Chri&s;t and his in&s;titutions, and our de|termination to obey his precepts, amid&s;t the unrea&s;onable prejudices of many a|gain&s;t the go&s;pel, requires a &s;pirit of for|titude and per&s;everance: it may draw up|on us the obloquy of &s;uch per&s;ons.

<P>HOW much does it become us to obey the commands of Chri&s;t, by ob&s;erving tho&s;e in&s;titutions by which we publicly

<P>BUT it is not nece&s;&s;ary for me at this time to adduce many arguments upon the &s;ubject, as you will &s;ee them fully &s;tated in tho&s;e books, to which I doubt not you will pay due attention.

I am, per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ps, too fondly attached to the &s;ociety, the plea&s;ures, the follies of the world.

<P><PB N="110" REF="022570_0407_0FB98CB06D2DDB60">THE truth is, tho I re&s;pect, tho I &s;in|cerely venerate the holy in&s;titution, yet I never, till now, thought it my indi&s;pen&s;a|ble duty to be initiated into its my&s;teries. I hope, &s;ir, you will not impute my neg|lect wholly to inattention, much le&s;s to a di&s;inclination to my duty, when convinc|ed of it. I knew my own weakne&s;s: I felt my heart, tho not vicious, too often cold and culpable. I had not the temeri|ty to make a public offering of a luke|warm virtue.

of unconfirmed and unhallowed virtue. A &s;hort lived enthu&s;ia&s;m has, I believe, led many a youth to the &s;acred altar, and to a &s;onorous profe&s;&s;ion, who&s;e &s;ucceeding conduct, tho it could never pollute the &s;potle&s;s image of religion in the eyes of the good and the di&s;cerning, has given the infidel, and the thoughtle&s;s, a pretext to contemn her precepts. How melan|choly, a fall like this! and how di&s;grace|ful to the ra&s;h youth, who dared venture into a rece&s;s too dazzling for his pow|ers! May I never be &s;uffered to offer &s;uch unhallowed &s;ervice at the foot of the altar! and whenever I &s;hall make an of|fering of my&s;elf at the holy &s;hrine, may a corre&s;ponding example ju&s;tify the deed; and my daily prayers and prai&s;es, &s;weetly ari&s;ing before the Almighty, prove the &s;incerity of my own heart!</P>

<P>AS tranquillity and contentment are requi&s;ite to the enjoyment of life, &s;o al&s;o to improvements in knowledge and vir|tue; for when the mind is re&s;tle&s;s and un|ea&s;y, it cannot pay that attention which is nece&s;&s;ary for the acqui&s;ition of knowl|edge; and, by indulging a di&s;contented humor, is di&s;qualified for virtuous exer|ci&s;es. The mind will be more or le&s;s at ea&s;e, according to the impul&s;es of tho&s;e different pa&s;&s;ions or principles which agi|tate it. In order to make the progre&s;s of learning ea&s;y and certain, it is nece&s;&s;ary to bring the mind to a balance, and to fix

its &s;ituation. This di&s;po&s;ition, like the order of the heavenly bodies, is generated by the harmonious effect of &s;everal pow|ers, acting in different directions. It may be difficult to adju&s;t the exact pro|portion of the&s;e different impul&s;es, where the &s;en&s;ibilities are &s;trong, lively, and va|rious; but in general it may be effected, by exciting one pa&s;&s;ion to counteract an|other, and throwing in one circum&s;tance in &s;uch time and order, as to balance an|other. By the con&s;tant vigilance of pa|rents, which the dome&s;tic &s;tate gives them opportunity to exerci&s;e, they may almo&s;t invariably pre&s;erve harmony in the minds of children, by this oppo&s;ite influence. Children who are dull or &s;tupid, may be ea&s;ily rendered contented: but tho&s;e who are formed for enjoyment as well as to charm others, are ea&s;ily deranged; and, if a coincidence and harmony of the &s;ev|eral principles and cau&s;es of action be not &s;ecured by proper management, will gen|erally be unhappy.</P>

<P>ROZELLA was more &s;imple in her ta&s;te, and appeared be&s;t in her own eyes, and in the eyes of every one el&s;e, when dre&s;&s;ed with a becoming plainne&s;s. She thought not the wor&s;e of any body on account of their dre&s;s, however plain it was; and treated every one with civility, whatever their condition in life might be. Rozella was contented and happy with what &s;he had, becau&s;e &s;he had learned to check and

moderate her de&s;ires: &s;he attracted the notice of every one who &s;aw her, becau&s;e &s;he was mode&s;t and una&s;&s;uming. Florin|da, on the other hand, was neither con|tented nor happy, becau&s;e her de&s;ires were extravagant and ever roving.

<P>MR. Bloom&s;grove, ob&s;erving the beau|tiful land&s;cape in the river, occa&s;ioned by the perfect tranquillity of its &s;urface, which, like a mirror, reflected every ob|ject before it, took the opportunity to recommend moderation to his children, as the only means of enjoying the plea&s;|ures of a &s;erene mind. From the plea&s;ing images then before them, he borrowed many in&s;tructive and entertaining ob|&s;ervations, which he farther illu&s;trated by &s;everal agreeable anecdotes.</P>
<P>"A BOY, fond of a butterfly, pur&s;ued it from flower to flower. He thought to &s;urpri&s;e it among the leaves of a ro&s;e;

then to cover it with his hat, as it was feeding on a dai&s;y. He followed it from blo&s;&s;om to blo&s;&s;om, but the nimble crea|ture &s;till eluded his gra&s;p. Ob&s;erving it now half buried in the cup of a tulip, he ru&s;hed forward, and happened to cru&s;h it. The poor boy, chagrined at his ra&s;hne&s;s, &s;eemed to be addre&s;&s;ed by the expiring in&s;ect in the following words.&mdash;"Behold the fruit of thy impetuo&s;ity! Know that plea&s;ure is but a painted butterfly, which may be indulged for amu&s;ement; but if embraced with too much ardor, will peri&s;h in thy gra&s;p."</P>
<P>THE other which I &s;hall mention was the different appearance of Parnaba&s;us, lord lieutenant to the king of Per&s;ia, and Age&s;ilaus, king of Lacedemon&punc; whom the other had invited to a treaty of peace with him. "The interview was in the open field. The fir&s;t appeared in all the pomp and luxury of the Per&s;ian court. He was dre&s;&s;ed in a purple robe embroid|ered with gold and &s;ilver: the ground was &s;pread with rich carpets, and cu&s;hions

<P>THE frequent repetition of &s;uch exam|ples had a good effect on O&s;ander, in&s;pir|ing him with a noble independence of &s;pirit; and his &s;i&s;ter, who li&s;tened to them with plea&s;ure, &s;aw that no part of true excellence con&s;i&s;ted in parade and finery, and that, to moderate her de&s;ires was the only &s;ure road to contentment.</P>

<P>MEMORY is one of tho&s;e u&s;eful faculties which de&s;erved notice before, becau&s;e it may be improved by early cul|ture. But it will not be mi&s;placed here, if we con&s;ider that it may be cultivated to much greater advantage in a mi&s;s in her teens, or a youth in the higher forms

of &s;chool learning, than in infancy, when it is difficult to fix the attention. The fir&s;t act of a child's memory is nothing more than a retention of &s;imple images, which are painted on the mind by &s;en&s;ible objects, without any idea of the relation of tho&s;e objects, by which the impre&s;&s;ion was made, to each other. That is, the child forms no judgment about the things &s;o impre&s;&s;ed; for it is merely pa&s;&s;ive in receiving them. But the ideas formed in con&s;equence of &s;uch &s;en&s;ations, ari&s;e from a capacity of judging of them. The only effectual way, therefore, to increa&s;e the retentive faculty, is to enlarge the under|&s;tanding. Whatever is committed to the infant memory &s;hould be adapted to the child's capacity, and be of u&s;eful tenden|cy; for the trea&s;ures &s;tored up in the memory, will have their influence in forming the character.</P>
<P>MR. Locke &s;uppo&s;ed that this faculty cannot be &s;trengthened by exerci&s;e. I believe that a contrary opinion, has been generally received. I &s;hall only remark,
<PB N="124" REF="022570_0421_0FB98CDA124C6AF0">
that there were no children in the &s;chool or vicinity, who&s;e memories were equal to the memories of Mr. Bloom&s;grove's child|ren. Whether this was owing more to a native &s;trength of this faculty, or to a habit of recollecting and frequently re|peating things committed to memory, I pretend not to &s;ay. They were accu&s;tom|ed from childhood to commit to memory little pieces, &s;uited to their age and un|der&s;tanding. That the&s;e pieces might never tire, but be a con&s;tant amu&s;ement, Mrs. Bloom&s;grove, who was a favorite of the mu&s;es, u&s;ed to compo&s;e &s;hort pieces, in pro&s;e and poetry, calculated to make virtuous impre&s;&s;ions.

the riche&s;t flowers, &s;u&s;pending its ne&s;t on the &s;lender branch of a weeping willow. As they grew, the&s;e pieces were enlarged, and others, of the mo&s;t cha&s;te and pure &s;entiment, collected from hi&s;tory, or poet|ry, &s;hort &s;ketches of the character of great and good men, dialogues, and &s;elect pieces.

<P>THE following remarkable in&s;tance of &s;trength of memory affords a plea&s;ant &s;tory. The fact is related in the life of Frederic the &s;econd, king of Pru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>"WHILE the celebrated Voltaire re&s;id|ed at Pot&s;dam, as the literary friend and companion of the late king of Pru&s;&s;ia, an Engli&s;hman was introduced to his maje&s;|ty, as one who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch an extraor|dinary memory, that he could repeat word by word, a very long di&s;cour&s;e, af|ter having heard it once. Frederic put him to an immediate proof of this won|derful
<PB N="126" REF="022570_0423_0FB98CE00D4E20C0">
retention, and the Engli&s;hman ju&s;|tified the character that had been given of him. At this in&s;tant Voltaire was to wait upon his maje&s;ty, to read him &s;ome ver&s;es he had ju&s;t fini&s;hed. The king, who was de&s;irous of enjoying &s;ome amu&s;ement from this &s;ingular circum&s;tance, cau&s;ed the Engli&s;hman to be concealed in a clo&s;et adjoining, and de&s;ired him to get by heart all that the poet might read. Voltaire entered, and read the ver&s;es with great animation. The king heard them with an air of coldne&s;s and indifference, to which the poet had not been accu&s;tomed. "Indeed, my dear Voltaire," exclaimed his maje&s;ty, "you have taken it into your head, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, to &s;teal ver&s;es from others, and to repeat them to me as your own." Voltaire affirmed with great earne&s;tne&s;s, that they were his, and that he had fini&s;hed them but that very morn|ing. The king then &s;ent for the Engli&s;h|man, and de&s;ired him to repeat the ver&s;es he had &s;hewn him that morning. The Engli&s;hman, without he&s;itation, and with|out
<PB N="127" REF="022570_0424_0FB98CE304F60CD0">
the omi&s;&s;ion of a &s;ingle &s;yllable, re|peated the whole of what Voltaire had read. The poor poet was a&s;toni&s;hed and enraged, and declared he mu&s;t be the Devil him&s;elf. The king did not fail to enjoy his anger and agitation for &s;ome time; but at la&s;t he confe&s;&s;ed the whole trick, and the &s;cene was concluded by his making a hand&s;ome pre&s;ent to the Engli&s;hman for the plea&s;ure he had af|forded them."</P>

<P>AMONG all the mon&s;trous pro|ductions of nature, there can &s;carcely be found a greater, than the heart of a pa|rent, which makes an idol of one child, while it neglects another. There may be a great difference in the qualities of child|ren, which is apt to induce a degree of partiality. But this is as imprudent, as it is wrong and unnatural; for where the others di&s;cover a decided partiality, they
<PB N="128" REF="022570_0425_0FB98CE96FD55C80">
cannot feel either filial piety or fraternal affection.</P>
<P>A MORE affecting in&s;tance of the fatal effects of it cannot be found, than in the hi&s;tory of Jo&s;eph. The whole &s;tory is intere&s;ting, and contains a variety of inci|dents, which furni&s;h many important le&s;|&s;ons of in&s;truction. Be&s;ides the mi&s;chiefs of parental partiality, it di&s;plays the fatal effects of envy, jealou&s;y, and di&s;cord a|mong brethren; the ble&s;&s;ings and honors with which virtue is rewarded; the beau|ties of a forgiving &s;pirit; the joys which flow from fraternal love, and filial piety. But I &s;hall only relate that part of it which has reference to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject.</P>
<P>WE are told that "Jacob loved Jo&s;eph more than all his children;" and whence this extraordinary partiality? The only rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for it, is, that "he was the &s;on of his old age." As good a rea&s;on as can generally be a&s;&s;igned for the partiality of parents! It is a blind guide, and &s;el|dom choo&s;es its objects from the di&s;cern|ment of peculiar merit. The favorite &s;on

is di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;ome peculiar marks of affection, which render him the object of jea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ou&s;y, envy, and hatred to the re&s;t. "His father made him a coat of many colors." Long had a &s;park of envy lurked in their brea&s;ts, and this decided prefer|ence kindled it into a flame. "And when his brethren &s;aw that their father loved him more than the re&s;t, they hated him, and could not &s;peak peaceably unto him." Of all the feuds and animo&s;ities which di&s;turb the peace of the world, tho&s;e of a dome&s;tic kind are the bittere&s;t and mo&s;t to be dreaded. They &s;hould therefore be &s;tudiou&s;ly avoided. The circum&s;tance which fixed this hatred, and determined them to &s;trike the deadly blow, which they had &s;o much rea&s;on to regret after|wards, was his relating to them a dream; which was, that "they were binding &s;heaves in the field, and that his &s;heaf &s;tood upright, while theirs made obei&s;ance to his." He probably related it in the &s;implicity of his heart. But their minds, awake to jealou&s;y, con&s;trued it into an in&s;ult. "And his brethren &s;aid unto
<PB N="130" REF="022570_0427_0FB98CEC5F65D780">
him, &s;halt thou indeed reign over us?" Another dream of a like tenor, in which "he &s;aw the &s;un, moon, and eleven &s;tars make obei&s;ance to him," gave umbrage even to the fond mother; and wrought up fraternal hatred to a perfect rage.</P>
<P>THE latent purpo&s;e only waits a favor|able opportunity to break forth into a dreadful &s;torm. When dome&s;tic jars have divided the affections of the family, and they lie in wait to injure each other, an opportunity is &s;eldom long wanting to the vigilant eye of malice and ill will. This was truly the ca&s;e with the &s;ons of Jacob. The un&s;u&s;pecting father &s;ends the favor|ite &s;on, but envied brother, to inquire af|ter the welfare of his brethren, who were feeding the flocks in a di&s;tant field. As they were ripe for vengeance, little el&s;e was nece&s;&s;ary, than to form a plan for the execution of it. "Behold, &s;ay they, the dreamer cometh," and they con&s;pired a|gain&s;t him to &s;lay him. When the end is determined upon, malice and envy are ingenious at inventing means for perpe|trating
<PB N="131" REF="022570_0428_0FB98CF66E718AA8">
the vile&s;t actions, and throwing a veil over them. So dangerous is the in|dulgence of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions!</P>
<P>"COME now, and let us &s;lay him, &s;ay they, and ca&s;t him into a pit; and we will &s;ay &s;ome evil bea&s;t hath devoured him; and we &s;hall &s;ee what will become of his dreams." One of his brethren, a little more humane than the re&s;t, propo&s;ed to commute the revenge from death, to &s;lav|ery in Egypt. They accordingly &s;old him to a company of traders who were going thither, where he was &s;old as a &s;lave. Horrid as the alternative was, it &s;eemed to be &s;ome alleviation of the crime.</P>
<P>THUS ended their malice and envy a|gain&s;t a brother, hated and de&s;pi&s;ed, not for any fault of his own, but for the ill judged partiality of a doating parent. But the heart of the aged parent is &s;oon to bleed thro the effects of its own im|prudence. The party coloured coat is to be brought before him, all drenched in blood. By this &s;tratagem, they attempt
<PB N="132" REF="022570_0429_0FB98CF7AEB2AA88">
to cover the ba&s;e, the cruel deed. It &s;uc|ceeds. The father recogni&s;es the coat, all &s;tained as it was. Yes; "it is my &s;on's coat: an evil bea&s;t hath devoured him: Jo&s;eph is without doubt rent in pieces." The full tide of parental affec|tion ri&s;es on the occa&s;ion. He refu&s;ed to be comforted, and &s;aid&mdash;"I will go down to the grave, unto my &s;on, mourning."</P>
<P>IT would be entertaining and delight|ful to follow the young captive down in|to Egypt, to note the various fortune of the exiled youth, and mark the &s;everal &s;teps by which he ro&s;e from his depre&s;&s;ed condition to the chief &s;eat of government there; his great wi&s;dom in becoming the &s;avior of his country; and to review all the tender &s;cenes of meeting his brethren, and of rejoicing the heart of his aged pa|rent, who had long mourned for him as dead. But the&s;e belong not to our pre&s;|ent de&s;ign.</P>
<P>THE &s;tory of Jo&s;eph was &s;o familiar to Mr. and Mrs. Bloom&s;grove, that they con&s;idered it as a &s;erious warning to
<PB N="133" REF="022570_0430_0FB98CFC4D6A43E0">
them&s;elves and all parents to guard again&s;t the like conduct. They ob&s;erved that tho&s;e parents who had a &s;tronger affection to one child than another, were blind to the faults of the favorite, which often proved its ruin. They al&s;o ob&s;erved that &s;uch partiality was often followed with in|gratitude from the favorite child. Solic|itous to rai&s;e him above the re&s;t, &s;aid Mr. Bloom&s;grove to the father of Mi&s;ander, they think no labor or expen&s;e too much: they deny them&s;elves every plea&s;ure, ex|cept what they enjoy in anticipating the figure which their darling child will make in the world. They are commonly much too &s;anguine in their expectations. But &s;uppo&s;e them quite an&s;wered, and that they &s;ee him ri&s;e &s;uperior to their hopes, yet how often does it happen that the con&s;equence of &s;uch partial regard, in|&s;tead of exciting &s;entiments of gratitude and re&s;pect, is, that he feels him&s;elf &s;upe|rior to his original, and blu&s;hes to ac|knowledge his parents and benefactors, who receive no other return for all their
<PB N="134" REF="022570_0431_0FB98CFD7854FD70">
exertions than being &s;hunned in public and de&s;pi&s;ed in private! This may be a ju&s;t puni&s;hment upon the parent for an unju&s;t partiality, but does not extenuate the ba&s;e ingratitude of the child.</P>

<P>IN a family like Mr. Bloom&s;grove's, where no enviable preeminence of one rai&s;es the hatred of the re&s;t, filial rever|ence may always be expected. The dig|nified familiarity which the&s;e parents ob|&s;erved towards the children and family, pre&s;erved the mo&s;t perfect bond of union; and while it prevented a &s;ervile fear, it created veneration and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>THO the authority of parents is, in its nature, ab&s;olute, yet it is by no means in|con&s;i&s;tent with familiarity, as their child|ren advance in age. This indeed is the mo&s;t effectual way to &s;ecure their rever|ence and obedience, becau&s;e it engages their e&s;teem and confidence. If family
<PB N="135" REF="022570_0432_0FB98D03F1539428">
di&s;cipline is pre&s;erved by coertion only, there can be no harmony between the heads and the members, and con&s;equent|ly very little dome&s;tic enjoyment. Child|ren may by this means be rendered abject and &s;ervile, but they will feel no re&s;pect or veneration.</P>
<P>MANY parents &s;eem to have no other ideas of family government, than that which con&s;i&s;ts in keeping their children at an awful di&s;tance, being &s;ilent and re&s;erv|ed before them, never &s;uffering any plea&s;|antry to pa&s;s between them, and &s;eldom &s;peaking to them but in a commanding tone of voice. In this ca&s;e they lo&s;e the be&s;t part of authority, that over the heart. The parent cannot di&s;cover the genius of the child, for it dares not exert it&s;elf. Nor can he ever know the true character of the child, for he is driven to a&s;&s;ume a ma&s;k in the pre&s;ence of the parent. There can be no plea&s;ure in each others company. The hou&s;e is a pri&s;on to the child, and the parent is the keeper. They mu&s;t either &s;it &s;ilent at home, or &s;teal
<PB N="136" REF="022570_0433_0FB98D04C2DB04A0">
away to &s;eek enjoyment abroad; and they never feel &s;o happy, as when out of the parent's &s;ight. This mu&s;t be a mo&s;t un|happy condition for per&s;ons connected by the clo&s;e&s;t ties of nature and &s;ociety.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, what can be a more plea&s;ing &s;ight than that of a parent, with conde&s;cending greatne&s;s, mixing in the &s;ocial plea&s;ures, and innocent mirth of his little flock? The young mind feels the obligation; and children will be cautious of doing any thing to di&s;plea&s;e a parent who will &s;tep out of him&s;elf, without lo&s;|ing &s;ight of his character, &s;o far as to be|come their intimate friend, and contribute to their plea&s;ures, at lea&s;t appear intere&s;t|ed in their childi&s;h pur&s;uits. As they advance towards maturity, more &s;enti|mental conver&s;ation, and more elevated plea&s;ures, may occupy the place of the puerile. The heart is open to receive any thing from &s;o good a parent. Coun|&s;el and admonition have the full force of authority; in&s;truction is ea&s;ily conveyed to the heart warmed with filial affection
<PB N="137" REF="022570_0434_0FB98D07776630A0">
and re&s;pect. They need not rove abroad for agreeable and rational &s;ociety: of this they experience the &s;weete&s;t enjoy|joyment within their own dome&s;tic circle.</P>
<P>OSANDER, during his tutelage, was un|der entire government, but felt no awk|wardne&s;s in his father's pre&s;ence. He could addre&s;s him without any re&s;erve, but never without re&s;pect; and as he ad|vanced towards manhood, he &s;eemed to be on terms of familiarity with his father, and felt all the plea&s;ures of friend&s;hip, but never lo&s;t the reverence of a &s;on. As the parent &s;tooped to meet the child, the child naturally ro&s;e to meet the parent. By conver&s;ing freely with him, he rai&s;ed the youthful mind to a manly habit of thinking and acting. Often would he advi&s;e with his &s;on about his affairs; and, whenever he could con&s;i&s;tently, he fol|lowed the plan he &s;truck out. By this mode of treatment, his &s;on acquired &s;ome knowledge of his father's circum&s;tances, and of a proper method of doing bu&s;ine&s;s. He &s;ecured the friend&s;hip and confidence
<PB N="138" REF="022570_0435_0FB98D0AC5E1A168">
of his &s;on, and erected the mo&s;t effectual barrier again&s;t fraud, di&s;&s;imulation, and the vices to which young people are li|able. Feeling the reverence of a &s;on unit|ed to the ties of familiar friend and com|panion, he was holden by a three fold cord, from tho&s;e dangerous combinations in vice, which are &s;ometimes &s;anctioned by the &s;acred name of friend&s;hip; and be|&s;ides this &s;ecurity, he was con&s;tantly im|proving from his father's experience and ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>I CANNOT conclude the&s;e ob&s;ervations, without noticing the advantage which might be derived from a &s;imilar practice in tho&s;e to whom the care and in&s;truction of children are committed. You never can forget the ridiculous figure which young Mr. &mdash;, one of the officers of in|&s;truction at &mdash;, made even in the eyes of all the pupils, by a&s;&s;uming an air of wi&s;dom and authority which did not be|come his age. See the vain youth, how he &s;wells! and &s;toutly exerts his borrowed power! His in&s;truction and government
<PB N="139" REF="022570_0436_0FB98D0D165B4828">
are carried on, not by lenient arts, but by magi&s;terial dictation. To be polite, or even civil, to tho&s;e young gentlemen who fell within the reach of his official power, he thought would be to let down his tu|torical dignity.</P>
<P>MR. &mdash;, the preceptor at Tu&s;culum, treated his pupils in a very different man|ner. He conver&s;ed freely with them, but with a dignity of manner that in&s;pir|ed awe, while it &s;eemed to admit them to the greate&s;t familiarity. His government was &s;teady and firm, but not &s;evere. There were few tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, becau&s;e there were few rules, and no unnece&s;&s;ary re&s;traints. He in&s;tructed more by com|municating to them than by dry le&s;&s;ons. He encouraged their a&s;king him que&s;t|ions, by the kind and communicative manner in which he an&s;wered them. This mode of treatment greatly facilitated their improvement, and gave him an op|portunity of di&s;covering how far they un|der&s;tood the &s;ubject they were upon. A dry le&s;&s;on, placed before a boy, may be ac|quired,
<PB N="140" REF="022570_0437_0FB98D13B5A087E8">
without his under&s;tanding any thing of the &s;ubject. But knowledge ac|quired in the other way, will be clear and durable, and what is &s;o acquired will be his own.</P>
<P>HE was not only a man of &s;cience and literature, but of polite accompli&s;hments. He treated his pupils as rational crea|tures, and as young gentlemen, who were to borrow their manners, in &s;ome degree, from him&s;elf. This endeared him to his pupils, and gave him an entire &s;way in their affections; and it recommended him to the notice and attention of all his em|ployers. How far preferable &s;uch a teacher to one of unformed manners, who has read books, but knows not how to read men!</P>

<P>INGRATITUDE and di&s;re&s;pect to parents is unnatural, &s;aid Mr. Bloom&s;|grove to a neighbor who was complaining
<PB N="141" REF="022570_0438_0FB98D16939ED3C0">
of the di&s;obedience of his &s;on, as they were one morning walking thro a grove; it mu&s;t therefore be owing generally to the mi&s;management of parents. Hero|dotus, continued he, in his account of the cu&s;toms and manners of the Per&s;ians, tells us that "They looked upon parri|cide as a thing impo&s;&s;ible; and that, when any thing happened that looked like it, the reputed &s;on was con&s;idered as &s;uppo|&s;ititious, and probably owing his birth to adultery." This &s;entiment &s;hewed in what light they viewed undutifulne&s;s in general: and it is &s;aid, that, among the Chine&s;e, di&s;odedience to parents is looked upon in &s;uch a light, even at this day, that, "If a &s;on &s;hould &s;o far forget him|&s;elf, as to lift up an ho&s;tile hand again&s;t his father, not only him&s;elf, but his wife and children, would be put to death; his &s;ervants and dependents would &s;hare the &s;ame fate, the hou&s;e where he lived would be razed, and the ground &s;owed with &s;alt, as &s;uppo&s;ing there mu&s;t be the mo&s;t hope|le&s;s depravity of manners in a communi|ty

to which &s;uch a mon&s;ter belonged." The gentleman acknowledged the ju&s;tne&s;s of the &s;entiment, and left him with a &s;igh.</P>
<P>IN the evening, happening to meet in the &s;ame &s;hady grove, the gentleman re|&s;umed the &s;ubject, and &s;aid&mdash;Ingratitude and di&s;obedience to parents is a conduct to be ranked among the ba&s;e&s;t crimes. It is increa&s;ed and aggravated by the count|le&s;s obligations conferred on children by parental care and tenderne&s;s. What anxious &s;olicitude and daily fatigue attend the nurture of helple&s;s infancy! What unwearied application is requi&s;ite in forming the minds and guarding the mor|als of youth! What anxieties often rend the parents' brea&s;t for the future welfare of their offspring! How often do they deny them&s;elves the conveniencies of life, that their children may have the &s;uperflu|ities? "The&s;e are obligations, replied Mr. Bloom&s;grove, which never can be cancelled."</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="022570_0440_0FB98D1C06D592A0">AND yet, continues the other, after all this, how often are they treated with di&s;|re&s;pect and ingratitude, and perhaps de|&s;pi&s;ed for tho&s;e very infirmities which pa|rental a&s;&s;iduity has brought upon them! "This &s;urely, rejoined Mr. Bloom&s;grove, is a height of impiety, that admits of nei|ther addition nor palliation: and 'he who fills his father's &s;oul with bitterne&s;s, and drowns his mother's eyes in tears, may ju&s;tly fear a &s;on that will revenge their wrongs.' Such ba&s;ene&s;s may ex|pect to experience, in turn, tho&s;e &s;harp pangs which it&s;elf has occa&s;ioned."</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the long tried friend&s;hip of parents, the continual recep|tion of benefits, which ought to engage ev|ery expre&s;&s;ion of duty and affection, it is an ob&s;ervation of undoubted truth, the gen|tleman replied, that there are many more undutiful children than there are unkind parents. "Our all wi&s;e Creator, &s;ays Mr. Bloom&s;grove, has &s;o ordered it, for the &s;ecurity and pre&s;ervation of the hu|man kind, that there &s;hould be very few
<PB N="144" REF="022570_0441_0FB98D1D8FDB72C0">
of the latter; for if parental care and ten|derne&s;s were generally rewarded with in|gratitude, there would not be that atten|tion paid to children which is nece&s;&s;ary to rear them up. The whole body of the Athenian laws, in the early &s;tate of that people, was compri&s;ed in this &s;hort &s;en|tence&mdash;"Honor your parents; wor&s;hip the Gods; hurt not animals." And by one of the laws of Solon, that per&s;on was accounted infamous, who treated his pa|rent with di&s;re&s;pect, or neglected that care of him which his circum&s;tances required. That great legi&s;lator never would e&s;tab|li&s;h any law again&s;t parricides, &s;aying&mdash; "The Gods forbid that &s;uch a mon&s;ter &s;hould ever come into our common|wealth." And it is certain that upwards of two centuries elap&s;ed, from the fir&s;t founding of Rome, before the name of parricide was known among them.</P>
<P>IN this re&s;pect the &s;entiments of Pa|gans, Jews, and Chri&s;tians, harmonize; and the laws of revelation perfectly con|cur with the language of nature. "Hon|or
<PB N="145" REF="022570_0442_0FB98D25EE6A56E8">
thy father and thy mother, was the fir&s;t command, with a promi&s;e" of temporal good. And the Mo&s;aic law bears the mo&s;t &s;olemn te&s;timony again&s;t di&s;re&s;pect to parents&mdash;"Cur&s;ed be he who &s;etteth light by his father or his mother, and all the people &s;hall &s;ay Amen." The crime is &s;o unnatural, that all men will approve the &s;entence.</P>
<P>HE then adduced &s;everal in&s;tances of filial piety worthy the imitation of all of every age, &s;ex, and condition&mdash;That of Eneas, who is &s;o ju&s;tly celebrated in an|cient hi&s;tory for &s;aving his aged father from the flames of Troy, whom he re&s;cued on his back thro raging flames, armed en|emies, and innumerable dangers: that of Jo&s;eph, who, when advanced to the chief &s;eat of government in Egypt, re&s;pectfully bowed him&s;elf to his father, and made his aged heart leap for joy, by his expre&s;&s;ion of filial re&s;pect and duty. Solomon did not lo&s;e the re&s;pect of a child in the au|thority of a king. He aro&s;e from the throne and bowed him&s;elf in a re&s;pectful

It was our early care, continued Mr. Bloom&s;|grove, to habituate our children to treat us with re&s;pect and dutifulne&s;s; and that which they did in childhood from habit, they now do from principle. They are con&s;tantly endeavoring to repay, by acts of filial piety, the debt of gratitude due to parental care and labor. The gentleman dropt a tear and bid him a good night.</P>
<P>CONTRASTED to the character of Mr. Bloom&s;grove's children, and the effect it had on their friends, was that of the un|happy Mi&s;ander. He was the &s;on of de|cent, worthy people, in good circum|&s;tances, but too ea&s;y and indulgent to|wards him. Mi&s;ander did not want abil|ities, but they had been much neglected. While young, and under the management of his mother, he was gratified in every thing he a&s;ked for, and never cro&s;&s;ed in any re&s;pect; and as he increa&s;ed in years, his pa&s;&s;ions grew without check or control. So blind was the eye of the indulgent pa|rents,
<PB N="147" REF="022570_0444_0FB98D28CAC20F10">
that his very faults were converted into perfections: His pertne&s;s, they con|&s;trued into wit; his pride, into noble|ne&s;s of &s;pirit; and his artfulne&s;s, into good &s;en&s;e. It was thought time enough to improve his mind and correct his man|ners, when riper years had e&s;tabli&s;hed his con&s;titution. The teachers to whom he had been committed for in&s;truction, were de&s;ired not to correct him, nor to be &s;trict in requiring of him the exerci&s;es that were exacted of other children; and he mu&s;t often be excu&s;ed from &s;chool on one pretence and another. This farce was carried on, till his pa&s;&s;ions had gathered too much &s;trength to be re&s;i&s;ted. He had a&s;&s;ociated him&s;elf with companions &s;uitable to his ta&s;te, and &s;uch as prevented him from being reclaimed. He had long &s;ince u&s;urped that authority over his pa|rents, which they &s;hould have exerci&s;ed over him: His will was law; and as he advanced towards manhood, his de&s;ires gradually became demands: His pa&s;&s;ions led him blindfold to every gratification.

will not fail to cheri&s;h in them a recip|rocal affection towards each other: and, indeed, in a family con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal children, there is a degree of fraternal re|&s;pect due from the younge&s;t to the elde&s;t; of protection from the elde&s;t to the younge&s;t; of delicacy, even in childhood, between the different &s;exes, and of affec|tion between them all, which require cul|tivation, and afford the attentive parent an opportunity to inculcate many u&s;eful le&s;&s;ons.</P>
<P>THE following extract of a letter which I have ju&s;t received from a judicious cor|re&s;pondent, I think de&s;erving of particu|lar notice. "The rights of promogeni|ture, &s;o much e&s;teemed among the Jews, I believe, are founded in nature, and have their u&s;es in every family. Where the elde&s;t &s;on or daughter is honored and preferred by parents, a family is never without government in the ab&s;ence of pa|rents from home; and when the&s;e parents are removed by death, there is a founda|tion laid in the habits of the younger

children for a continuance of &s;ubordina|tion in a family&mdash;a circum&s;tance always e&s;&s;ential to harmony and happine&s;s!"</P>
<P>ON reading this, an in&s;tance immedi|ately occurred to me, of the u&s;efulne&s;s of &s;ubordination among children. There was a family, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal &s;ons and daughters, who were made orphans, while they were young. The olde&s;t, a daughter of an amiable di&s;po&s;ition, un|dertook to pre&s;erve the family together by her own management, which &s;he ef|fected greatly to her own credit, and to the advantage of the re&s;t. The &s;ons were trained to bu&s;ine&s;s, and the daugh|ters were well educated in the habits of indu&s;try and the embelli&s;hments of ta&s;te. They lived together in great harmony and affection, until &s;he had an advanta|geous offer in marriage, when they were all nearly grown to mature age, which &s;he accepted, and was happily &s;ettled with a worthy companion, who is now in flour|i&s;hing circum&s;tances. She engaged the e&s;teem of all her acquaintance, and is
<PB N="152" REF="022570_0449_0FB98D4026E492D0">
now ju&s;tly numbered among the mo&s;t amiable of her &s;ex in dome&s;tic life.</P>
<P>BY the elde&s;t child being honored and preferred, my friend could mean no more than that re&s;pect which is due to a priori|ty in age; and this is ju&s;t and rea&s;onable, for it is founded in nature, and is nece&s;|&s;ary for &s;ociety. Let a per&s;on be recom|mended to you as excelling in affection to his brothers and &s;i&s;ters, as remarkable for his attention to his mother, and for tenderne&s;s and attachment to his family, your heart will in&s;tantly bear te&s;timony in his favor; you will e&s;teem and honor him.</P>
<P>THE wi&s;e author of nature hath im|planted in our brea&s;ts tho&s;e tender &s;ym|pathies, which, while they are u&s;eful to &s;o|ciety, are very plea&s;ing to our&s;elves: and this affection &s;trengthens in proportion to the nearne&s;s of the relation, or the habits of living together. Therefore it may naturally be expected, from the general idea of man as a &s;ocial creature, and from that of a family, as the fir&s;t &s;ocial connex|ion,
<PB N="153" REF="022570_0450_0FB98D4180A91140">
that affection and friend&s;hip &s;hould prevail here in perfection. Here we are to look for the mo&s;t perfect amity, a har|mony that &s;tands oppo&s;ed not only to prejudice and ill will, but to indifference and re&s;erve.</P>

<P>DOCTOR Percival, in one of his enter|tertaining pieces, gives us the following agreeable mirror. "I will amu&s;e you with a little experiment, &s;aid Sophron, one evening, to Lucia, Emelia, Alexis, and Jacobus; and ri&s;ing from the table, he took the candles, and held them about

The motto round the figure, UNHURT AMIDST THE WAR OF ELEMENTS, was ju&s;t di&s;tinctly vi&s;ible. When the degree of light had been &s;uf|ficiently ob&s;erved, he united the flames of the candles together; and the whole fig|ure, with the in&s;cription, became in&s;tantly illuminated in a much &s;tronger manner than before.</P>
<P>"THEY were all plea&s;ed and &s;truck with the effect; and they de&s;ired Euphronius, who now entered the parlour, to explain the cau&s;e of it. He commended their entertainment, and informed them that a greater degree of heat is produced by the junction of the two flames, and con&s;e|quently a further attenuation and more copious emi&s;&s;ion of the particles, of which light con&s;i&s;ts: But, my dear children, continued he, attend to the le&s;&s;on of vir|tue as well as of &s;cience.

and the&s;e &s;ocial affections are &s;eparate &s;hining lights in the world.

<P>FOR the exerci&s;e of the&s;e virtues, there will be room in the be&s;t regulated fami|lies.

It will di&s;po&s;e each to conde|&s;cend to the other, and to make the mo&s;t candid allowances for each others foibles. It will &s;hew it&s;elf in attempts to reclaim a di&s;&s;olute and vicious brother, and the tear of &s;ympathy will wa&s;h away the &s;tain of guilt.</P>

<P>THIS is one of the mo&s;t plea&s;ing traits in a young gentleman's character, and will never fail to recommend him to the female &s;ex, and &s;ecure him the e&s;teem of his own. They will naturally conclude, that he, who, from motives of brotherly affection, devotes his attention to a &s;i&s;ter, on account of the delicacy of her &s;itua|tion, is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a good di&s;po&s;ition. They will have little doubt that a dutiful &s;on, and a complai&s;ant brother, will make an attentive hu&s;band. A complai&s;ant brother never need tear neglects on a &s;i&s;|ter's part. I will pledge my&s;elf for the female world, that they will never be in|&s;en&s;ible to &s;uch attentions, nor ever cea&s;e to return them with tenderne&s;s and every office of &s;i&s;terly affection. Should &s;uch a brother, in any in&s;tance, experience the

neglect of a &s;i&s;ter, he would be much le&s;s affected by it, than &s;he would be by his: he is more independent, and has le&s;s need of attentions. He may act as he plea&s;es; &s;he mu&s;t always do what is proper. He can defend him&s;elf; &s;he mu&s;t be kindly protected. He may &s;ay what he knows; &s;he mu&s;t &s;ay what is agreeable. A young gentleman may be uncouth in his man|ners; if he has under&s;tanding, it in a great mea&s;ure compen&s;ates the want of the graces: but a young lady without ta&s;te cannot by any means balance the deficiency. A brother's politene&s;s to a &s;i&s;ter con&s;i&s;ts in offering her every &s;ervice in his power; a &s;i&s;ter's, in receiving his attentions gracefully, and returning them by gentle and obliging manners.</P>

They are not di&s;plea&s;ed at his gallantry; but his want of politene&s;s to an amiable &s;i&s;ter often draws upon him their &s;evere remarks. His civil|ities would be much more plea&s;ing to the ladies in general, if his &s;i&s;ter &s;hared in them. Such neglects are the more inex|cu&s;able, becau&s;e they wound a &s;i&s;ter very &s;en&s;ibly, and becau&s;e his attentions might be rendered to her without pain or ex|pen&s;e on his part.

<P>"IN the year 1585, the Portugue&s;e Caracks &s;ailed from Li&s;bon to Goa, a very rich and flouri&s;hing colony of that nation in the Ea&s;t Indies. On board of one of tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els, there were no le&s;s than twelve hundred &s;ouls. The beginning of
<PB N="161" REF="022570_0458_0FB98D5E8C04EF50">
their voyage was pro&s;perous, but not ma|ny days after, thro the perver&s;ene&s;s of the pilot, the &s;hip &s;truck on a rock, and in|&s;tant death began to &s;tare them in the face. In this di&s;tre&s;s, the captain order|ed the pinnace to be launched, into which having to&s;&s;ed a &s;mall quantity of bi&s;cuit, and &s;ome boxes of marmalade, he jumped in him&s;elf with nineteen others, who, with their &s;words, prevented the coming of any more, le&s;t the boat &s;hould &s;ink. Thus &s;cantily equipped, they put off into the great Indian ocean, without compa&s;s to &s;teer by, or any fre&s;h water, but what might happen to fall from the heavens, who&s;e mercy alone could deliver them. At the end of five days, the captain died with &s;ickne&s;s, and they were oblig|ed, to prevent confu&s;ion, to elect one of their company to command them. This per&s;on propo&s;ed to them to draw lots, and ca&s;t every fourth man overboard, their &s;mall &s;tock of provi&s;ion being now &s;o far &s;pent, as not to be able, at very &s;hort allowance, to &s;u&s;tain life above three days

<P>"THE lots being ca&s;t, three of the fir&s;t &s;ubmitted to their fate, after they had confe&s;&s;ed and received ab&s;olution. The fourth victim was a Portugue&s;e gentle|man, who had a younger brother in the boat; who, &s;eeing him about to be thrown overboard, mo&s;t tende<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> embraced him, and with tears be&s;ought him to let him die in his room; enforcing his arguments by telling him, "that he was a married man, and had a wife and children at Goa, be&s;ides the care of three &s;i&s;ters, who ab&s;o|lutely depended upon him for &s;upport; whereas him&s;elf was &s;ingle, and his life of no great importance." He conjured him therefore to &s;uffer him to &s;upply his place; a&s;&s;uring him that he had rather die for him, than live without him. The elder brother, a&s;toni&s;hed, and melting with his genero&s;ity, replied, "that &s;ince the di|vine providence had appointed him to

Thus di&s;membered of both hands, he made a &s;hift, notwith&s;tanding, to keep him&s;elf above water with his feet and two &s;tumps, which he held bleeding upwards.

They then continued rowing all night; and the next morning, when the &s;un aro&s;e (as if heaven would reward the gallantry and piety of this young man) they de&s;cried land; which proved to be the mountains of Mozambique, in Africa, not far from a Portugue&s;e colony.

<P>THAT &s;ervants &s;hould be &s;ubject to government, is readily granted; but this ought to be exerci&s;ed agreeable to the rights of human nature, and with a kind allowance for its imperfections; and it &s;hould be &s;o exerci&s;ed, as to &s;ecure their e&s;teem and affection as well as &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.

<P>IN a country, where the divi&s;ion of property approaches &s;o near an equality as in the United States, particularly in New England, and where the government is founded in equality, &s;ervitude will be lighter than in tho&s;e countries, where cu&s;|tom has e&s;tabli&s;hed a greater and more decided di&s;tinction.

Tho&s;e who attempt to influence their &s;er|vants, of whatever de&s;cription, by the ex|erci&s;e of benevolence and mildne&s;s, will find it much more effectual, than the ex|ertion of mere authority.

<P>MRS. &mdash;, a lady of re&s;pectable char|acter, who now lives in &mdash;, has many excellent qualities, is famed for piety, and it is confidently &s;aid &s;he has but one fault, and that is, her conduct towards her &s;er|vants. This indeed is of &s;uch magnitude, as to ab&s;orb many good qualities, and to ca&s;t a &s;hade over the mo&s;t brilliant char|acter. It is &s;aid, &s;he often entertains her friends with tedious tales of the vilene&s;s and ill behavior of her &s;ervants. She has charity for almo&s;t every one el&s;e, but none for them. She often laments, as a good woman, the weakne&s;s and infirmity of human nature; but appears to expect from her &s;ervants a conduct, which we
<PB N="170" REF="022570_0467_0FB98D7782C1FA78">
are to look for only from beings who have none of tho&s;e imperfections. It is re|ported that &s;ome of her &s;ervants have ventured to &s;ay, that, altho &s;he is called a good woman, yet &s;he is &s;evere and un|kind towards them; that &s;he is never &s;at|isfied with what they do, even when they do their utmo&s;t to plea&s;e her; and I am inclined to believe that the report is not without foundation, for &s;he often changes them. Her hu&s;band makes no preten|&s;ions to religion. He is a man of quick and violent pa&s;&s;ions, and is governed in all his conduct by pre&s;ent feelings. But altho he is pa&s;&s;ionate, capricious, and &s;ometimes very &s;evere, yet he does at times treat them with kindne&s;s, and is willing to allow that they have &s;ome merit.</P>
<P>IN order to make &s;ervants faithful, and render them &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to order and gov|ernment, we mu&s;t &s;ecure their e&s;teem and affection; then every thing will go on ea&s;y and agreeable. But, if we under|take to procure &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion by the force

of authority only, the ta&s;k will be ardu|ous, and our eye mu&s;t be perpetually over them; we mu&s;t i&s;&s;ue our orders in a pe|remptory tone, and, after all, mu&s;t fre|quently endure the painful jealou&s;y of undutifulne&s;s, and want of fidelity. On the contrary, if, by our equity and gen|tlene&s;s towards &s;ervants, we &s;ecure their affection, we have the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible influ|ence over them. They will not only be &s;ub&s;ervient to our plea&s;ure, but be &s;o with cheerfulne&s;s.

<P>MR. Bloom&s;grove had the mo&s;t entire government over his hou&s;ehold. But his &s;ervants were more afraid of di&s;plea&s;ing him, than of being puni&s;hed. They o|bey,

They feel them&s;elves rich, becau&s;e they think he is &s;o; and they con&s;ider all his misfortunes as befalling them&s;elves. He reigned &s;ecurely in their affection, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an authority over them, on all occa&s;ions cordially acknowl|edged, without &s;eeming to be a&s;&s;erted.</P>
<P>MRS. Bloom&s;grove was the idol of her &s;ervants, and every thing depends on the mi&s;tre&s;s of a family with re&s;pect to them. They were loud in her prai&s;es; for &s;he always treated them with great humanity and tenderne&s;s. She con&s;idered them as fellow creatures, placed indeed in a lower &s;tation, but not the le&s;s entitled to kind and gentle u&s;age. She ever con&s;idered it a dictate of humanity, to render a &s;tate of &s;ervitude and dependence as light and ea&s;y as po&s;&s;ible. She viewed them as friends of humbler rank. She never de&s;|cended to a familiarity which le&s;&s;ened her in their e&s;teem; and if, at any time, they pre&s;umed too far upon her goodne&s;s, &s;he
<PB N="173" REF="022570_0470_0FB98D8150AA8290">
knew how to pre&s;erve her dignity. She was careful to &s;ee them well in&s;tructed in their duty to God, and to one another, as well as to do the office of menial do|me&s;tics. In order to this, proper books were provided and kept for them; for they were all taught to read who fell with|in the reach of her care. Nothing could be a finer &s;troke of dome&s;tic policy, &s;epa|rate from religious con&s;iderations. By thus appearing to have an intere&s;t in their happine&s;s, it rendered her very dear to them, and made them hold her in high veneration.</P>
<P>THE character and condition of &s;ervants requires &s;ome degree of di&s;tance and re|&s;erve on our part, of humility and rever|ence on theirs: but all this may con&s;i&s;t with a degree of familiarity, e&s;pecially of equity and kindne&s;s, to which they have the faire&s;t claim, as well from the &s;ervice rendered, as from the equality of nature; and if we con&s;ider that we have all one ma&s;ter, to whom we are amenable for all our conduct towards each other, in our

<P>THE lowe&s;t dome&s;tic is entitled not on|ly to civility, but to benevolent and kind u&s;age from every member of the family. In &s;ome families you &s;ee them treated in a taunting, overbearing manner, by child|ren, and the younger parts of the family, who are &s;upported in &s;uch ungenerous conduct by their parents; but nothing can be more cruel and impolitic. It is cruel, becau&s;e it is a violation of the laws of nature and humanity. It is impolitic, becau&s;e it &s;ours their mind again&s;t tho&s;e whom they &s;erve, and renders them le&s;s de&s;irous to plea&s;e, and more aver&s;e to the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>MRS. Bloom&s;grove taught her children from infancy, to &s;peak kindly to the &s;er|vants, and to a&s;k, not command, them to do any &s;ervice they wi&s;h from them. "They are not your &s;ervants, my dear,"

Rozella never forgets her, when &s;he has any cake or fruit, but always imparts a &s;hare to Ca&s;pina. The pre&s;ent is of little worth, but the notice and attention are of ine&s;|timable value.

<P>IN forming and pre&s;erving the mor|als of youth, two things are e&s;pecially nec|e&s;&s;ary to be regarded. They are, the per|nicious effects of bad company and bad books.

evil, becau&s;e it commences at a much ear|lier period than the other.</P>
<P>MAN is formed for &s;ociety; and, in a &s;tate of ab&s;olute &s;olitude, there can be no enjoyment. Our joys are in&s;ipid, when alone; and our &s;orrows in&s;upport|able, without a friend. "From &s;ociety proceed all the refined comforts and &s;upe|rior enjoyments of life; and from &s;ociety, (&s;o very much mixed are all human ble&s;&s;|ings) proceed the greate&s;t advantages and evils of life. Good &s;ociety is no le&s;s dif|ficult to attain, than it is advantageous when attained. Evil &s;ociety, as common as the air, is as bla&s;ting to the manners, as that air, when it bears on its noxious wings pe&s;tilence and di&s;ea&s;e." So true is this, that it became a &s;acred maxim, that "Evil communications corrupt good manners." And it is an adage of long &s;tanding, "Tell me with whom you go, and I will tell you what you are."</P>
<P>MRS Bloom&s;grove, who appears to have &s;tudied human nature with great atten|tion, was extremely cautious on this head.

Le&s;t the minds of her children &s;hould be tainted with the bad qualities of others, &s;he endeavored to find amu&s;ements for them at home; and when they went a|broad, &s;he commonly accompanied them, or rather carried them with her on vi&s;its when young; and afterwards &s;he and her hu&s;band were very watchful over the characters of the youth with whom they a&s;&s;ociated. Boys are in much more dan|ger from this quarter than girls: they have more opportunities, and le&s;s cau|tion: they have need therefore of more con&s;tant watchfulne&s;s. If they are &s;uf|fered to mix intimately with rude, di&s;or|derly children, they will in&s;en&s;ibly con|tract &s;imilar habits, which will baffle all dry le&s;&s;ons to the contrary.</P>
<P>AN intimacy therefore was encouraged between O&s;ander, Philo, and two or three others of good di&s;po&s;ition and decent manners.

<P>BISHOP Burnett gives us the following account of the learned and pious Sir Matthew Hale&mdash;That when a youth he was too much addicted to the &s;ociety of &s;ome vicious people, which he did not break off, till an alarming accident drove him from it. Being invited with &s;ome other young &s;tudents to a carou&s;e out of town, one of the company drank to &s;uch exce&s;s, that he fell down as dead before them.

The cir|cum&s;tance &s;o affected Mr. Hale, who had remon&s;trated again&s;t the exce&s;s, that he went into another room, and &s;hutting the door, fell on his knees, and prayed ear|ne&s;tly to God, both for his friend, that he might be re&s;tored to life again, and that him&s;elf might be forgiven for having coun|tenanced &s;uch exce&s;&s;es.

It was this great man's re&s;olution, drawn up by him in writing for his own private u&s;e, with regard to company (among other ar|ticles of conduct) to "do good to them; to u&s;e God's name reverently, while with them; and to receive good from them, if they were more knowing than him&s;elf."</P>

O&s;ymandias; and upon the front of it was the following in&s;cription, "MEDE|CINE FOR THE MIND." This was ex|pre&s;&s;ive of the true de&s;ign of books. But it is with books, as it is with &s;ociety; they are the occa&s;ion of much good to the world, and vehicles of great mi&s;chief. Bad company and bad books have a &s;im|ilar effect on the mind; they corrupt and debauch the heart, while they plea&s;e the fancy. It is a melancholy reflection, that &s;uch books &s;hould be extant. But &s;o it is. The world abounds with them; and they are generally written in order to catch the imagination of the reader, and beguile into vice and error unawares. I do not confine the idea to books of infi|delity, profe&s;&s;edly written to undermine the beautiful fabric of chri&s;tianity, but ex|tend it to all books which have a tenden|cy to &s;erve the cau&s;e of immorality, and to be the foul vehicles of indecency, ob&s;cen|ity, and profanity.</P>

They found it was nece&s;&s;ary to read with attention, and to make the &s;ub|ject their own, by dige&s;ting it in their own minds; and were &s;ure to be &s;et right, if they had mi&s;taken the writer's de&s;ign. Many take upon tru&s;t whatever they read, e&s;pecially upon a favorite topic, and nev|er con&s;ider the objections which lie again&s;t it. Others run over books in &s;o cur&s;ory a manner, that they &s;carcely collect a &s;enti|ment
<PB N="189" REF="022570_0486_0FB98DACC088DB28">
from what they read. They exert no powers of the mind, in order to pluck the flowers which are &s;cattered up and down the unfolding pages, as they go on. If books of ill fame and bad tendency &s;hould be read even in this manner, they may be &s;weet in the mouth, but bitter in the end, for the lurking poi&s;on will be im|perceptibly conveyed thro the &s;y&s;tem, and, if repeated, will corrupt the whole ma&s;s.</P>
<P>ANOTHER thing which contributed much to their improvement, was their be|ing directed to keep a common place book, to note the material occurrences, the books they read, the &s;ubjects on which they treated, with their own comments upon them, and to tran&s;cribe &s;ome of the mo&s;t remarkable pa&s;&s;ages they contained. This proved a very great advantage to them, both on account of pre&s;erving the knowl|edge they acquired, and al&s;o of maturing their judgment. While many other young people, who had read no le&s;s than they, could recollect little more of a book than

<P>APROPOS&mdash;I con&s;ider it a circum&s;tance mo&s;t au&s;picious to the ri&s;ing generation, that our country now abounds with books &s;uitable to every age, and both &s;exes.

<P>"WORDS, &s;ays Mr. Addi&s;on, are the tran&s;cript of tho&s;e ideas, which are in the mind of man. Writing and printing are the tran&s;cript of words. As the Supreme Being has expre&s;&s;ed, and, as it were, printed his ideas in the creation, men ex|pre&s;s their ideas in books; which, by this great invention of latter ages, may la&s;t as long as the &s;un and moon, and peri&s;h on|ly in the general wreck of nature.

<HEAD>LETTER LXXVII.</HEAD>
<P>ON the &s;ubject of religion, mankind are crumbled into an almo&s;t infinite va|riety of &s;chemes; and, not &s;atisfied with enjoying that which their education, or their own choice, led them to embrace, have poured out torrents of abu&s;e upon others.</P>
<P>MR. Bloom&s;grove, being a per&s;on of an independent &s;pirit, and di&s;regarding the terms of reproach with which ignorance or intolerance would guard its u&s;urpa|tions, pur&s;ued his own judgment in the religious in&s;truction of his family. His fir&s;t object was, to &s;tamp on their docile minds, an impre&s;&s;ion of a benevolent Deity; not doubting but &s;uch an impre&s;|&s;ion,
<PB N="194" REF="022570_0491_0FB98DBB0B3AC180">
early made, would become a ruling principle of action.</P>
<P>IT was placing morals on a &s;ure foot|ing, to a&s;&s;i&s;t their young minds in form|ing &s;ome idea of a Supreme Being, and to cheri&s;h &s;uitable affections towards him, as a continual &s;pring of good actions. A regard to per&s;onal intere&s;t or reputation, may induce a man of bu&s;ine&s;s to punctu|ality and hone&s;ty in his dealings. A love of prai&s;e may excite to many actions of u&s;eful tendency; and a variety of motives may operate in di&s;po&s;ing men to pre&s;erve a fair character; but no re&s;pect may be had in all this to any fixed principles of action. As God is the &s;upreme object of all religious exerci&s;es, &s;o a conduct flowing from re&s;pect to him will be &s;teady and uniform, like the motive it&s;elf. This depends not on any pre&s;ent apparent good, nor on the opinion of the world; but on the &s;en&s;e of moral obligation; and as the authority of God is invariable, and extends to the intention as well as the ac|tion, &s;o to have this moral &s;en&s;e cheri&s;hed
<PB N="195" REF="022570_0492_0FB98DBF2BCEFB28">
in the mind, will afford the mo&s;t effectual &s;ecurity again&s;t vice, however &s;ecretly it may be practi&s;ed, and will be a con&s;tant &s;timulus to virtue, tho it be not &s;een of men.</P>
<P>THERE can be very little doubt, that where the morals of youth are pre&s;erved pure, religion will have its proper influ|ence in the heart. Religion is natural to man; and &s;o long as the human heart can be guarded again&s;t acquired corrup|tion, it will feel a tendency to the indulg|ence of devotion. Sen&s;ibility, refined and elevated affections, will mark its char|acter in this &s;tate of purity. But in pro|portion as vice is &s;uffered to make its in|roads, that delicacy and &s;u&s;ceptibility, with which nature u&s;ually furni&s;hes the heart, will be de&s;troyed; "and in the general extinction of our better qualities, it is no wonder that a &s;entiment &s;o pure as that of piety, &s;hould be one of the fir&s;t to expire. It is certain that the under&s;tand|ing may be improved in a knowledge of the world, and in the arts of &s;ucceeding
<PB N="196" REF="022570_0493_0FB98DC11ACFA5C0">
in it, while the heart, or whatever con&s;ti|tutes the moral and &s;entimental feelings, is gradually receding from its original perfection. Indeed, experience &s;eems to evince, that it is hardly po&s;&s;ible to arrive at the character of a complete man of the world, without lo&s;ing many of the mo&s;t valuable &s;entiments of uncorrupted na|ture. A complete man of the world is an artificial being. He has di&s;carded many of the native and laudable tenden|cies of his mind, and adopted a new &s;y&s;tem of obj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cts and propen&s;ities of his own creation. The&s;e are common|ly &s;uch as tend directly to blunt the &s;en&s;e of every thing liberal, enlarged, and di&s;|intere&s;ted; of every thing, which partici|pates more of an intellectual than of a &s;en&s;ual nature."</P>
<P>MR. Bloom&s;grove took great care to pre&s;erve this moral &s;en&s;ibility; and al|ways directed the minds of his children to God, as the fir&s;t object of all religious re|gard. This he con&s;idered as the great principle which binds together univer&s;al intelligence, and leads all rational beings
<PB N="197" REF="022570_0494_0FB98DC981EFF8C0">
up to the common &s;ource. Without this nothing can be &s;ecure; no actions or promi&s;es, relied upon; all appearances mu&s;t be delu&s;ive; morality, but a name, a &s;ign without the thing &s;ignified; &s;ociety mu&s;t crumble to pieces, and all things fall into confu&s;ion!</P>
<P>SINCE, then, religion is the great combin|ing power which unites the moral world, and &s;ecures the order and cour&s;e of things among men, without &s;ome degree of which they could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t, and with the highe&s;t degree of it would be entirely happy, how wi&s;e a part did Mr. Bloom&s;|grove act, in cheri&s;hing it in his children! As this could not be effected but by com|municating ju&s;t ideas of the Deity, he conceived it a duty of indi&s;pen&s;able obli|gation to &s;econd the voice of nature (which has engraven on the mind the be|ing of a God and the wor&s;hip due to him) by more explicit in&s;truction.</P>
<P>BEFORE O&s;ander and Rozella were able to comprehend any con&s;i&s;tent idea of a Supreme Being, their mamma always

repre&s;ented him in the mo&s;t plea&s;ing and amiable light; in &s;uch a light, as was cal|culated to di&s;pel gloomine&s;s, in&s;pire love, and contribute to &s;erenity and cheerful|ne&s;s of mind. This had a mo&s;t happy effect on their di&s;po&s;itions; and led th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to form the mo&s;t plea&s;ing idea of the di|vine character, when they were capable of receiving more rational in&s;truction concerning it. At this period, they were taught to look up to God as their heaven|ly father and friend; that they ought to perform his will, which is to do all the good in their power; that God is always pre&s;ent, and that not a thought can be concealed from him. The&s;e in&s;tructions were accompanied with de&s;criptions of the Deity, as kind and benevolent; con|ducting all things for the good of his crea|tures; always countenancing the virtu|ous, and rewarding them, if not in this life, yet mo&s;t certainly in a life to come. They de&s;cribed him as the friend of the good, and the enemy of none but the wicked, whom he readily forgives
<PB N="199" REF="022570_0496_0FB98DCE8E74F550">
and receives to favor, when they repent. "As your papa and I, &s;aid Mrs. Bloom&s;|grove, when in&s;tructing them one day on this &s;ubject, are never di&s;plea&s;ed with you, my dear children, except when you be|have ami&s;s, &s;o our heavenly father is "an|gry with the wicked only&punc;" Good child|ren, continued &s;he, are not afraid of their parents; and they have no rea&s;on to be afraid of their heavenly parent."</P>
<P>"AS it is a capital branch of education, I think the mo&s;t capital, &s;ays Lord Kaimes, it merits great attention. It is ea&s;y to fortify in children the belief of a Deity, becau&s;e his exi&s;tence is engraved on the human heart; but it is far from being ea&s;y to fortify belief, &s;o as to be|come a ruling principle of action: and yet this is indi&s;pen&s;able; for belief, with|out producing that effect, is of little &s;ig|nificancy in any ca&s;e; and lea&s;t of all with re&s;pect to the duties of religion, which are the great and ultimate end of in&s;truction. In order that a firm belief of the Deity may warm the mind to per|&s;evere
<PB N="200" REF="022570_0497_0FB98A118D8F4870">
in what is right, the following hints may be of u&s;e to parents and tutors.</P>
<P>"TAKE early and proper opportuni|ties of talking plea&s;antly to your children of their heavenly father, who loves them, and who, tho un&s;een, is always doing them good; that he created the &s;un to warm them, and made the earth to pro|duce every thing nece&s;&s;ary for their nour|i&s;hment, and for their clothing. In fine weather, lead them to the fields, and point out to them the various beauties of na|ture. 'How beautiful that &s;mooth plain, inter&s;ected with a &s;tream perpetually flowing! how comfortable to the eye its verdure, and how beneficial, by giving food to many innocent and u&s;eful ani|mals! Behold that gay parterre, varie|gated with a thou&s;and &s;weet colors. See that noble oak &s;preading its branches all around, affording a &s;hade in &s;ummer, and &s;helter in winter. Li&s;ten to the birds which cheer us with their mu&s;ic, and are bu&s;ily employed in bringing forth their young.' Impre&s;s it upon the minds of
<PB N="201" REF="022570_0498_0FB98A131463ECC8">
your children, that all the&s;e things are contrived by our heavenly father to make us happy; and that it ought to be our chief delight to te&s;tify upon all occa&s;ions our gratitude to him."</P>
<P>THE parents of O&s;ander and Rozella, who conducted their religious education in this manner, were happy in finding that it prevented them from entertaining any of tho&s;e frightful notions of the Deity, which were formerly thought to con&s;ti|tute the e&s;&s;ence of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eligion. In tho&s;e ages, when &s;uper&s;tition reared its &s;able &s;tandard, and taught men that, to &s;erve God with fear and dread was the only acceptable manner of wor&s;hipping him, the Deity was repre&s;ented as &s;evere and unforgiving. Nothing could be more pernicious to the cau&s;e of religion, than &s;uch ideas of its author. Weak minds, it rendered abject and &s;ervile; but the bold and the incon&s;iderate became totally neg|ligent of religion. But as men acquired more rational notions of the Deity, the gloom of &s;uper&s;tition di&s;&s;ipated, as vapor before the ri&s;ing &s;un.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="022570_0499_0FB98A1480A23B40">MR. Bloom&s;grove took an early and uncea&s;ing care to cheri&s;h the devout af|fections in his children, while his eye watched over the other pa&s;&s;ions of nature, which were &s;pringing up. "The fear of God is the beginning of wi&s;dom;" of re|ligious knowledge and practice. But the love of God is the parent of devotion in the heart. Whenever they admired the &s;un's refulgent beams, the full orbed moon, or any of the &s;triking beauties of nature, he endeavored to rai&s;e their thoughts to the Creator; to &s;et before them his great|ne&s;s and maje&s;ty, without tho&s;e terrors that might drive them from the contem|plation, but in&s;pire them with a glow of piety and gratitude. In their &s;ea&s;ons of recreation and innocent delights, he would repre&s;ent him as the indulgent parent, from who&s;e bounty they enjoyed &s;uch ble&s;&s;ings, and who, at all times, can be|&s;tow every good, and guard from every pain and evil. In &s;ickne&s;s he recom|mended to them to bear it patiently, be|cau&s;e they were in the hands of God, who

will do what is be&s;t for them; and be|cau&s;e he will reward their patience in a proper time. It was by means of this cheerful doctrine, early in&s;tilled into their minds, that they acquired a habit of look|ing up to the Deity in the amiable light of friend and benefactor, while awe and veneration, free from &s;ervile dread, com|po&s;ed their minds.</P>
<P>AT the age of twenty, Rozella affords to her &s;ex a mo&s;t plea&s;ing example of pi|ety; and whatever advantage religion can receive from the lu&s;tre of female ac|compli&s;hments, it derives from her. In the mid&s;t of youthful life, and polite cir|cles, &s;he never forgets who, and what &s;he is. She never does any thing of con&s;e|quence, without fir&s;t con&s;idering whether it will be agreeable to her maker, and &s;at|isfactory to her own mind, upon reflec|tion.

<P>MR. Bloom&s;grove was prevented fol|lowing the delightful &s;ubject any further at that time, by the approach of night.

<P>TO render our&s;elves agreeable to each other by &s;oft and graceful manners, is a dictate of humanity. To do this from principles of benevolence, and with|out di&s;&s;imulation, is among the leading precepts of Chri&s;tianity. I am &s;orry to find that polite writers have recommend|ed the art of plea&s;ing upon different grounds. Some learned writers, of au&s;|tere virtue, have condemned the art of plea&s;ing, not only as having no connex|ion with religion, but as incon&s;i&s;tent with the purity and &s;implicity of its doctrines. While others, inattentive to true excel|lence, have con&s;idered religion either as incompatible with, or no ways related to the art of plea&s;ing. The former we &s;hall di&s;mi&s;s, with their brother Diogenes, to
<PB N="218" REF="022570_0515_0FB98A2F9583DBB8">
his &s;olitary tub, and endeavor to rectify the mi&s;taken notion of the other.</P>
<P>IF the true art of plea&s;ing con&s;i&s;ts in an appearance of good di&s;po&s;itions and amiable qualities, exhibited in an agreea|ble light, then the perfection of this art mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the qualities which we would di&s;play. For the reali|ty mu&s;t certainly be more agreeable than an appearance only. Can any one be more plea&s;ed with flattery and deceit than with truth and &s;incerity? Can &s;oftne&s;s and plau&s;ibility of manners atone for the want of benevolence and genero&s;ity? Or can attention, a&s;&s;iduity, and gracefulne&s;s, compen&s;ate for meanne&s;s of &s;pirit, hard|ne&s;s of heart, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and a total want of tho&s;e virtues which can flow only from oppo&s;ite pa&s;&s;ions?</P>
<P>I WOULD recommend to you, my young friends, to exalt the talent of plea&s;|ing a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ove the fraudful arts of flattery and deceit: place it in the rank of virtues &s;ounded upon principle, and on the be&s;t di&s;po&s;itions of human nature. Indeed,
<PB N="219" REF="022570_0516_0FB98A311B2A4110">
the virtues and the graces are much more nearly allied, than tho&s;e who are the ad|vocates of the latter, without po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the former, are &s;en&s;ible of. The moral virtues, when clearly under&s;tood and re|duced to practice, afford an a&s;&s;emblage of every thing beautiful and excellent; and what can be more agreeable than that placid &s;erenity, by which image the true character of religion is de&s;cribed? You will readily allow that good coin is, in all ca&s;es, preferable to counterfeit; and it will never fail of having a currency from its own intrin&s;ic value. As much more valuable, and &s;ure of &s;ucce&s;s, are attempts to plea&s;e, when excited by mo|rality and religion (to which all the em|belli&s;hments of external gracefulne&s;s may be added) than the tin&s;el out&s;ide of fal&s;e pretenders, with all their duplicity.</P>
<P>WHAT can be more conducive to the true art of plea&s;ing, than that gentlene&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition and manners&punc; that pliability of temper and conduct, which the &s;ub|lime morality of the go&s;pel recommends?
<PB N="220" REF="022570_0517_0FB98A330F98CC40">
Whatever is malignant in its nature, or hurtful in its tendency, religion roots out or corrects; and inculcates whatever is ju&s;t, mild, and candid. By curing the heart of its moral di&s;orders, eradicating pride, envy, malice, and all the malevo|lent pa&s;&s;ions, it de&s;troys the &s;ource of ev|ery thing di&s;agreeable in manners; and, by inculcating the oppo&s;ite di&s;po&s;itions, promotes a &s;y&s;tem of conduct, which, without any guile or deceit, cannot fail of being agreeable.</P>
<P>TO form an opinion of the different ef|fects of that plea&s;ing art which flows from principle, and that which is void of &s;in|cerity, contra&s;t the character of Mr. M&mdash; with that of Mr. N&mdash;.

with varni&s;hed qualities, which are not &s;upported by any thing within corre&s;|ponding to them. Under this di&s;gui&s;e, lurk meanne&s;s, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and avarice. In his private character, he is as remarka|ble for cruelty to his &s;ervants, unchari|tablene&s;s to the poor, and the want even of an appearance of friend&s;hip or benev|olence to tho&s;e, who&s;e riches or rank do not lead him to cultivate their favor, as he is for the elegance of his manners in polite circles.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, Mr. N&mdash;, who&s;e actions are the true index of his heart, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es qualities equally capable of plea&s;ing all, without the danger of of|fending any by the want of virtue and benevolence. To the polite addre&s;s of an accompli&s;hed gentleman, he unites all the virtues of the Chri&s;tian. He evident|ly derives his talent at plea&s;ing, not from the &s;tudy of the world, not from an ap|pearance of qualities which di&s;gui&s;e real deformities; but from the amiable di&s;po|&s;itions of the heart, expre&s;&s;ed in his grace|ful

<P>SATISFIED that all religion &s;tands or falls with this, Mr. and Mrs. Bloom&s;grove accu&s;tomed their children and family to a decent ob&s;ervance of that day, &s;acred to in&s;truction and piety. That they might derive every po&s;&s;ible advantage from an in&s;titution &s;o admirably fitted to our con|dition in the pre&s;ent life, they ro&s;e at an early hour to hail the welcome day; and, having offered the morning incen&s;e on the

dome&s;tic altar, they repaired con&s;tantly to the place of public wor&s;hip; alluring their family to a cheerful attendance by motives &s;uited to their age and di&s;po&s;i|tion, by the beauty and order of wor&s;hip, and by their own example, and that of others.</P>
<P>HAVING e&s;tabli&s;hed the practice of a &s;teady attendance, they found no diffi|culty in continuing it; and nothing could exceed the beauty of this little flock, moving together in &s;olemn pace, to pay their devout attendance on the ordinances of religion. Every member of the fami|ly, who could po&s;&s;ibly be &s;pared from the nece&s;&s;ary offices of a dome&s;tic &s;tate, always appeared at both public &s;ervices of the &s;ab|bath.

<P>THAT no kind of influence might be wanting to render the public &s;ervices u&s;e|ful to the family, the worthy clergyman, who&s;e mini&s;try they attended, was treated with every mark of re&s;pect by them; and was often made a gue&s;t at their ho&s;pitable table and in their friendly circles.

attention to whatever practice would en|courage a &s;pirit of piety and virtue among his hou&s;ehold.

They accounted the &s;ab|bath a delight, the holy of the Lord, hon|orable; and the church of Chri&s;t the gate of heaven: and tho rich in the goods of fortune, and high on the li&s;t of fame, yet they e&s;teemed religion to be their chief riches; and that it was their highe&s;t hon|or to be numbered among the di&s;ciples of the humble Je&s;us.</P>

<P>ON reading the pamphlets which you were &s;o obliging as to &s;end me, I can|not forbear to expre&s;s my a&s;toni&s;hment at the incon&s;i&s;tency, between the love of lib|erty which prevails in our country, and the practices of many individuals in in|thralling their fellow creatures. Ameri|cans can write with preci&s;ion upon the principles of liberty. With valor they can defend their own liberties, when at|tacked by foreign power or dome&s;tic in|&s;urrection! and yet many, who can de|fend their own rights with one hand, are extending the other for the purpo&s;e of en|&s;laving a part of their own &s;pecies.

<P><PB N="233" REF="022570_0530_0FB98A4FDCE3BC98">I AM very &s;orry to find that my worthy friend Mr. M&mdash; has changed &s;ides; and from being an able, and warm advo|cate for the rights of human nature, and the liberties of mankind, has become an advocate for the practice of en&s;laving the Africans, by excluding them from a com|munity of nature with our own &s;pecies.

As well may we do this, as &s;uppo&s;e the Africans incapable of improvements, and, therefore, an inferior order of beings, becau&s;e they, as a people, have not exhib|ited marks of genius equal to more civil|ized and enlightened nations. In&s;tances of genius, however, have not been want|ing among them, tho they are not numer|ous. If there is any weight in this argu|ment, does it not prove too much? Is there a greater difference between the av|erage abilities of Americans and that of the Africans, than between the acquire|ments of Sir I&s;aac Newton and a common porter in Philadelphia? If there is not, and yet their inferiority is to prove that they are not of the &s;ame &s;pecies with us, will it not follow that the above mention|ed porter belongs to a &s;pecies of beings inferior to that of Sir I&s;aac Newton? Nay,

<P>AMONG the many excellent remarks which Governor Jeffer&s;on, now Amba&s;&s;a|dor at the court of Ver&s;ailles, makes on this &s;ubject, I think the following worthy the &s;erious con&s;ideration of Mr. M&mdash;, which may have e&s;caped his notice.</P>
<P>SPEAKING of Virginia, he &s;ays, "There mu&s;t doubtle&s;s be an unhappy influence on the manners of our people produced by the exi&s;tence of &s;lavery among us. The whole commerce between ma&s;ter and &s;lave is a perpetual exerci&s;e of the mo&s;t boi&s;ter|ous pa&s;&s;ions, the mo&s;t unremitting de&s;pot|i&s;m on the one part, and degrading &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ions on the other. Our children &s;ee this, and learn to imitate it; for man is an

imitative animal. This quality is the germ of all education in him. From his cradle to his grave, he is learning to do what he &s;ees others do. If a parent could find no motive either in his philanthropy or his &s;elf love, for re&s;training the intem|perance of his pa&s;&s;ion towards his &s;lave, it &s;hould always be a &s;ufficient one that his child is pre&s;ent. But generally it is not &s;ufficient. The parent &s;torms, the child looks on, catches the lineaments of wrath, puts on the &s;ame airs in the circle of &s;maller &s;laves, gives a loo&s;e to his wor&s;t of pa&s;&s;ions, and thus nur&s;ed, educated, and daily exerci&s;ed in tyranny, cannot but be &s;tamped by it with odious peculiarities. The man mu&s;t be a prodigy, who can re|tain his manners and morals undepraved by &s;uch circum&s;tances. And with what execration &s;hould the &s;tate&s;man be loaded, who, permitting one half the citizens thus to trample on the rights of the other, transforms tho&s;e into de&s;pots, and the&s;e into enemies, de&s;troys the morals of the one part, and the <HI>amor patriae</HI> of the oth|er.
<PB N="237" REF="022570_0534_0FB98A58C80F4350">
For if a &s;lave can love a country in this world, it mu&s;t be any other in prefer|ence to that in which he is born to live and labor for another; in which he mu&s;t lock up the faculties of his nature, contribute as far as depends on his individual en|deavors to the evani&s;hment of the human race, or entail his own mi&s;erable condition on the endle&s;s generations proceeding from him.</P>
<P>"WITH the morals of the people, their indu&s;try is de&s;troyed. For, in a warm climate, no man will labor for him&s;elf who can make another labor for him. This is &s;o true, that of the proprietors of &s;laves a very &s;mall proportion indeed are ever &s;een to labor. And can the liberties of a nation be thought &s;ecure, when we have removed their only firm ba&s;is, a con|viction that the&s;e liberties are the gift of God? That they are not to be violated but with his wrath? Indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is ju<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">: that his ju&s;tice cannot &s;leep forever: that con&s;idering numbers, nature, and

<P>IT hence appears that true policy and dome&s;tic education, as well as religion and morals, loudly plead again&s;t a practice, which has no other than intere&s;ted and avaricious motives to plead in its favor. As the public mind is now prepared to bear te&s;timony again&s;t this practice, which centres in the hands of a few individuals only, and is rapidly growing into di&s;repute in Europe, query whether the evil might not be radically cured, by making it a part of dome&s;tic education? And it were to be wi&s;hed that &s;hort dialogues, and other pieces, &s;uitable for &s;chools and academies, were offered to the public by &s;ome able hand, in which the inju&s;tice and inhu|manity of the practice may be properly exhibited. This would have a tendency
<PB N="239" REF="022570_0536_0FB98A5D542D5438">
to beget, in the minds of youth, an early dete&s;tation of it. It is undoubtedly our duty to arre&s;t the attention of young minds to the cau&s;e of virtue and human|ity, peace and charity, by every means which has any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>HOW incompatible this commerce is with the character of a Chri&s;tian people, you may clearly learn from I&s;aiah's pro|phetic de&s;cription of the peaceable king|dom of the Me&s;&s;iah, and the happy ef|fects it would produce on the temper and conduct of mankind towards each other? Beautiful is the figure, and peaceful the motto of this prophetic portrait. The &s;cene is laid as on the &s;ummit of a gilded mountain, which reflects its divinely en|lightening rays on every &s;ide, until "the whole earth is full of the knowledge of the Lord." On the top of this mountain &s;prings up a branch, from an ancient &s;tock, green, vigorous, and &s;preading. Under its &s;hadow, the wolf and the lamb, the leopard and the kid, the lion and the &s;atling, the young child and the &s;erpent,

all re&s;t together in harmonious &s;ort. And this is their perpetual motto, "THEY SHALL NOT HURT NOR DESTROY IN ALL THIS HOLY MOUNTAIN."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ISAIAH, xi. 9.</NOTE></P>
<P>P. S. IF we &s;hould, for a moment, al|low Mr. M&mdash; to be right in his theory, it does not follow that we have a right to the involuntary and unrewarded &s;ervice of the Africans; much le&s;s that we have any right to make property of them; for God never gave man this right. The original grant of dominion to man over the inferior ranks of creatures extended only to "the fi&s;h of the &s;ea, the bea&s;ts of the earth, the fowl of the air, and every thing that CREEPETH upon the earth." Any order of creatures, however inferior to us, not an&s;wering either of the&s;e de|&s;criptions, cannot fall under the dominion of man in the &s;en&s;e in which they do.</P>
<P>AND in what re&s;pect do Africans an|&s;wer this de&s;cription? If in none, it will follow that there is no &s;en&s;e in which we can claim them as property.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="022570_0538_0FB98A658E302038">BUT if we &s;hould grant that the claims of property, founded on &s;uppo&s;ed inferi|ority in the &s;cale of being, is ju&s;t; yet nothing can ju&s;tify the cruel u&s;age they often experience. The ground on which dominion over the animal world was given to man, was, the likene&s;s he bore to the Deity. It was merely on account of his being endued with rea&s;on and moral recti|tude, and in&s;pired with kind and benevo|lent affections, by which he was a&s;&s;imu|lated to the divine character, that he was con&s;tituted lord of this lower creation, and made the repre&s;entative of its great author and governor, and the di&s;pen&s;er of his authority. And as we are created after the image of God, &s;o we &s;hould imitate his example, in the government of the univer&s;e, in exerci&s;ing that dominion over the animal world which he has given us.

<P>WILL you now, my dear &s;ir, take a turn with me back to the &s;chool at Tu&s;|culum, where we find O&s;ander making improvements under his judicious pre|ceptor, which an&s;wered the expectations and gratified the wi&s;hes of his father. He pur&s;ued his &s;tudies with &s;uch indu&s;try, as &s;oon gained him the fir&s;t rank of &s;cholar|&s;hip among the youth. He did not, how|ever, acquire a reli&s;h for the dead lan|guages. The native energy of his genius made him pant for more improving and agreeable &s;tudies.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="022570_0541_0FB98A6A0BD167E8">I THINK it is a matter worthy of con|&s;ideration, whether the Latin and Greek languages have not been made, too much, the te&s;ts of genius in our &s;chools; and whether public advantage might not ari&s;e from aboli&s;hing the cu&s;tom of making a knowledge of them an indi&s;pen&s;able con|dition of a public education. Many per|&s;ons of genius, perhaps, have been pre|vented gaining their proper rank in &s;oci|ety, becau&s;e they could not plod the dull round of ta&s;tele&s;s languages. The time, which is con&s;umed in the &s;tudy of the&s;e languages, by tho&s;e who will have no u&s;e for the knowledge of them in the bu&s;ine&s;s or occupations of life, might, &s;urely, be better employed in the pur&s;uit of &s;uch branches of learning, as would apply more directly to their future employments.</P>
<P>OF this Mr. Bloom&s;grove became more convinced, as he perceived that his &s;on made great proficiency in other parts of literature. As he de&s;igned his &s;on for a civilian, he determined to wa&s;te no more time in the &s;tudy of languages, for which
<PB N="245" REF="022570_0542_0FB98A6B9569D3A8">
he had no ta&s;te. In order that his mind might be formed to a right temper, and the habits of virtue might be well fixed, he continued him longer at the &s;chool than u&s;ual, for the &s;ake of having him un|der his own eye. He con&s;idered, on the other hand, the danger which might fol|low from retaining him too long within the narrow &s;phere of the dome&s;tic &s;tate.</P>
<P>A YOUTH of genius, at the age of &s;ix|teen or &s;eventeen, who has been indu&s;tri|ous at &s;chool, begins to require new ob|jects to excite emulation, and a new field for exertion. Altho his pa&s;&s;ions begin to gather &s;trength, at this period, and new appetites begin to &s;pring up, yet, if do|me&s;tic education has been well conducted, the mind will be provided with a balance again&s;t them; and he may be &s;afely tru&s;t|ed abroad in the higher walks of &s;cience.</P>
<P>INDUCED by &s;entiments like the&s;e, Mr. Bloom&s;grove placed his &s;on at the univer|&s;ity at &mdash;, whither his vigilant eye fol|lowed him; and every prudent method was taken to guard him again&s;t the &s;educ|tions
<PB N="246" REF="022570_0543_0FB98A7024FB8780">
of vice, and to allure him to virtue. It is too commonly the ca&s;e, that when parents have committed their children to the care of others, they relax in their own attention to them. Confiding entirely in the integrity and abilities of tho&s;e, to who&s;e care they are committed, they no longer watch over them. But tho&s;e, to whom the care of youth is committed, &s;eldom con&s;ider them&s;elves under any other obligations than to teach the art or the &s;cience for which they apply, and to re&s;train them from vicious habits, no fur|ther than is nece&s;&s;ary to the purpo&s;e of doing this. Between the&s;e two errors, the culture of the heart is neglected.</P>
<P>MR. Bloom&s;grove determined that no effort &s;hould be wanting on his part, to complete the culture of his &s;on's heart, and pre&s;erve his morals. He, therefore, a&s;&s;ured his &s;on that he &s;hould follow him to the univer&s;ity with a watchful eye, with a parent's heart; expre&s;&s;ing great confidence in his prudence and attention to the objects before him. He enjoined
<PB N="247" REF="022570_0544_0FB98A7284B3DF68">
it upon his &s;on to write him frequently; and, at the end of every month, to render him an account of his &s;tudies. This method enabled Mr. Bloom&s;grove to judge of his proficiency, while it gave him an opportunity of admini&s;tering &s;alutary advice.</P>
<P>THE proficiency, which O&s;ander made at the univer&s;ity, was flattering to his pa|rents, as well as honorable to him&s;elf. But this plea&s;ure was a little interrupted, &s;ome time after his entrance there, by an information that he was in danger of be|ing en&s;nared, and led a&s;tray by &s;ome di&s;|&s;olute youth, as it appears from the fol|lowing letter. As the moderation, firm|ne&s;s, and confidence expre&s;&s;ed in it, had the de&s;ired effect, I will &s;end it you by the next po&s;t.</P>

<P>THUS far, my dear &s;on, have your parents watched over you from helple&s;s infancy.

To withdraw that &s;olicitude and attention at the pre&s;ent, which is the mo&s;t critical and important period of your life, would be no le&s;s cruel to you than unnatural in them. In your prudence, integrity, and virtue, we have all that confidence, to which your years can lay claim.</P>
<P>IN order that our confidence in you may not be &s;haken, it is nece&s;&s;ary that we call your attention to the &s;ituation you are in, and to the circum&s;tances which &s;urround you.

<P>THE vigilance and artfulne&s;s of de&s;ign|ing profligates may improve that facility of mind as a means of &s;eduction; but a prudent youth will ever be upon his guard again&s;t the dangers to which he is expo&s;|ed, and never &s;uffer the genero&s;ity of his temper to be the dupe of their crafty de|&s;igns. The mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences would, probably, attend a fal&s;e &s;tep at this period. Every thing in the future part of your life is depending on the pre&s;|ent moment. Puerility &s;hould now yield to more &s;olid judgment. Fancy &s;hould give place to con&s;ideration; and under|&s;tanding &s;hould &s;upply the place of &s;en&s;i|bility and impre&s;&s;ions.

On your own exertions you mu&s;t rely for rendering the means of literary acqui&s;itions effectual; and on your dili|gence, for proficiency in knowledge. Let the bu&s;ine&s;s of the univer&s;ity be your plea&s;ure; and let amu&s;ements be plea&s;|ures, only as a nece&s;&s;ary relaxation from &s;tudy.

<P>OSANDER had too much di&s;cern|ment, not to &s;ee the object at which his father aimed; and too much &s;en&s;ibility, not to feel the force of the confidence which his father placed in him. It had the de&s;ired effect; and his father never had occa&s;ion afterwards to addre&s;s him on the &s;ame &s;ubject, tho the corre&s;pondence continued till he completed his univer&s;ity education, which he did with great repu|tation, and much to the &s;atisfaction of his friends.</P>
<P>AFTER receiving the honor of a degree, he continued to re&s;ide at the univer&s;ity, for the benefit of the library, and of the public lectures. He continued his &s;tud|ies, particularly in hi&s;tory, chronology, ethics, rhetoric, the law of nature and nations, and politics, under the direction of Mr. Profe&s;&s;or &mdash;, till an affair at home made his return nece&s;&s;ary. What that was &s;hall be related in another place.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="022570_0551_0FB98A82D2971820">ALTHO I have not taken a view of O|&s;ander's progre&s;s thro the &s;everal &s;tages of his education, yet I cannot omit to men|tion one or two things in his father's man|age<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ent, with re&s;pect to him, which I think worthy of imitation. He furni&s;hed O&s;ander with a memorandum book, in which he was directed to give credit for all the monies he received, and charge all his bills, which he was to pre&s;erve as vouchers; and make minutes of his loo&s;e expen&s;es, noting the places, and for what they were incurred.</P>
<P>THO O&s;ander's expen&s;es could not be great, from his &s;tudious turn, yet keeping an exact account of the monies received, and how expended, had a good effect in accu&s;toming him to method in his affairs, and to accuracy in accounts. It would not have been ea&s;y, if he had been di&s;po&s;|ed, to have eluded his father's vigilant eye, or to have pa&s;&s;ed many impo&s;itions upon him. It could not be very difficult to judge of the probability of the account

from the general character, and from the company he kept.</P>
<P>VOLATILE youth often become profli|gate for want of this check; and if &s;uch an one has a plentiful &s;upply of money at college, without rendering to his father any account of his expen&s;es, it is much but his expen&s;es prove his ruin. His ambition to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf as a per&s;on of &s;pirit and figure, will &s;oon lead him to look upon the drudgery of college exer|ci&s;es as beneath him. His books and his in&s;tructors will be inimical to his enjoy|ments; and he will find more plea&s;ure in his vices than in literary pur&s;uits.</P>
<P>"A NOBLE Venetian, who&s;e &s;on wal|lowed in the plenty of his father's riches, finding his &s;on's expen&s;es grew very high and extravagant, ordered his ca&s;hier to let him have, for the future, no more money than what he would count when he receiv|ed it. This, one would think no great re&s;traint to a young gentleman's expen&s;es, who could freely have as much money as he could tell. But yet this, to one who
<PB N="256" REF="022570_0553_0FB98A8B78C9B840">
was u&s;ed to nothing but the pur&s;uit of his plea&s;ures, proved a great trouble, which at la&s;t ended in this &s;ober and advanta|geous reflection: 'If it is &s;o much pains to me, barely to count the money I &s;pend, what labor and pains did it co&s;t my ance&s;|tors, not only to count, but to get it?' This rational thought, &s;ugge&s;ted by the little pains impo&s;ed upon him, wrought &s;o effectually upon his mind, that it made him, from that time forward, prove a good hu&s;band."</P>
<P>BESIDES the advantage which it would have on a young gentleman's economy, to have the &s;tate of his expen&s;es always before him, this plan of keeping his ac|counts, and being brought to frequent &s;et|tlements with his father, lays a founda|tion for &s;y&s;tem and method in his af|fairs; the habits of which are of the ut|mo&s;t con&s;equence, both to intere&s;t and morals, thro the whole cour&s;e of life.</P>

<P>THE progre&s;s of learning might be greatly accelerated by a regular &s;y&s;tem in the pur&s;uit of it. In&s;tructors of youth might afford great a&s;&s;i&s;tance to their pu|pils, by directing them to a proper arrange|ment of &s;tudies, to books proper to be read on each &s;ubject or &s;cience to be pur&s;ued, to a &s;uitable proportion of time to be allotted to each branch. Much time is lo&s;t by a confu&s;ion of &s;tudies, and by a promi&s;cu|ous manner of reading books.</P>
<P>BUT my object is to con&s;ider the ad|vantages of &s;y&s;tem on a larger &s;cale, which befits the age and employments of young Mr. Bloom&s;grove, who is &s;oon to appear on the great theatre of the world. From the &s;y&s;tematic manner in which he has been trained, we may naturally &s;uppo&s;e that &s;y&s;tem and order will attend all his affairs. He who does not meet every duty in its own place, and a&s;&s;ign it its proper rank, cannot expect to pre&s;erve
<PB N="258" REF="022570_0555_0FB98A9087C0FC40">
the natural order and connexion of things, or form any con&s;i&s;tency of character.</P>
<P>A RIGHT divi&s;ion of time is as nece&s;&s;ary as order in the arrangement and di&s;charge of the duties of our re&s;pective depart|ments. Nothing is performed right, where nothing is performed in its proper time and place. Confu&s;ion mu&s;t attend the life of &s;uch a man. But, by a prudent management of his affairs, and an orderly arrangement of time, a man may live more in a few years than others do in many. He arre&s;ts every flying hour: He lo&s;es no time by confu&s;ion in his affairs; but, u&s;ing it with economy, he accumulates a &s;tock, to which the indolent wa&s;ter of time mu&s;t be forever a &s;tranger.</P>
<P>METHOD in every part of conduct is a matter which de&s;erves the particular at|tention of young people; and the follow|ing maxims &s;hould be deeply fixed in their minds.</P>
<P>"PROVIDE what is nece&s;&s;ary, before you indulge in what is &s;uperfluous."</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="022570_0556_0FB98A91C04DF8F0">"STUDY to do ju&s;tice to all, with whom you deal, before you affect the prai&s;e of liberality."</P>
<P>THE want of economy has been a fruit|ful &s;ource of di&s;tre&s;s and mi&s;ery: Fami|lies, once flouri&s;hing, have been reduced to ruin: the melancholy widow, the help|le&s;s orphan, have been thrown out friend|le&s;s upon the world. To ea&s;e and afflu|ence have &s;ucceeded the pinching hand of poverty, occa&s;ioned by an ill timed piece of expen&s;e, which brought confu|&s;ion on their affairs.</P>
<P>WHEN young men live beyond their means, they tread on enchanted ground; their path is &s;trowed with poi&s;onous flowers; perplexity and danger mu&s;t at|tend their progre&s;s. It is as incompati|ble with indu&s;try as it is with prudence. Their pa&s;&s;ions gather &s;trength with the prodigal wa&s;te of &s;ub&s;tance. The en|chantments of habit become invincible; and, with their eyes open, they plunge them&s;elves into the gulf before them, tho often admoni&s;hed by the fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of others.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="022570_0557_0FB98A975BBBEA20">AN old military gentleman, who was as much di&s;tingui&s;hed for his morals as for his courage, told a friend, "that his fa|ther, who was a &s;en&s;ible man, but ex|tremely devout, &s;eeing that he was much inclined to a certain vice, &s;pared no pains to curb this propen&s;ity; but finding, notwith&s;tanding all his care, that his &s;on &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in his vices, he carried him to an ho&s;pital e&s;tabli&s;hed for the cure of a certain vile di&s;ea&s;e; and without any previous intimation of his de&s;ign, led him into a gallery full of tho&s;e unhappy wretches, who were &s;everely expiating the folly which had brought them thither. At this hideous &s;pectacle, &s;o offen&s;ive to all the &s;en&s;es, the young man grew &s;ick. 'Go thou wretched debauchee, &s;aid the father, with a &s;ignificant look and em|pha&s;is, follow thy loo&s;e inclinations; it will not be long before thou wilt think thy&s;elf happy in being admitted into this place.

<P>FATAL, indeed, are the effects of prodigality, or the neglect of method in living! But he who forms his conduct upon his circum&s;tances, and di&s;charges the obligations&punc; he owes to &s;ociety, will neither wa&s;te his &s;ub&s;tance by prodigal|ity, nor de&s;troy his virtue by extravagant plea&s;ures. But, pre&s;erving the liberty and independence of his own mind, he
<PB N="262" REF="022570_0559_0FB98A9A5ED48460">
will be able always to act his part with fortitude as a man, and with fidelity as a Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>"THE youth, who has acquired a reli&s;h for the plea&s;ures of devotion, yields his heart to tho&s;e plea&s;ures. He views, at a di&s;tance, the active life upon which he has entered, and makes a true e&s;timate of wealth, fame, and preeminence.

<P>THE regulation of amu&s;ements is a mat|ter of great con&s;equence for young people to attend to, both as to time and place. Parents and others of rigid virtue, having pa&s;&s;ed the &s;ea&s;on of youthful plea&s;ures, are too apt to look with indignant eye upon all tho&s;e recreations by which human
<PB N="263" REF="022570_0560_0FB98A9E8177FA00">
cares are relieved, and the union of &s;oci|ety cemented. By thus pa&s;&s;ing an indi&s;|criminate cen&s;ure on all amu&s;ements, they lo&s;e all that influence over youth, which age, rendered re&s;pectable by virtue, al|ways po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>MR. Bloom&s;grove, therefore, did not aim at re&s;training his children from all amu&s;ements, but at a&s;&s;i&s;ting them in the regulation of amu&s;ements, &s;o as not to in|terfere with the higher duties of life. In countries full of inhabitants and of wealth, plea&s;ure becomes the bu&s;ine&s;s of many. But in a country ju&s;t ri&s;ing into national exi&s;tence, indu&s;try mu&s;t con&s;ti|tute <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts wealth, and bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t form its plea&s;ures. When Virgil &s;ung, in capti|vating &s;trains, the peaceful occupations and affecting plea&s;ures of rural life, the Romans had lo&s;t all ta&s;te of them, and &s;ought the means of luxury and di&s;&s;ipa|tion, by oppre&s;&s;ing or plundering prov|inces.

<PB N="264" REF="022570_0561_0FB98AA1E32F7240">
on their more wealthy neighbors, they ruined the commonwealth. It would not require a &s;pirit of prophecy to predict the fate of the&s;e &s;tates, if a love of plea&s;ure &s;hould &s;o far prevail, as to root out in|du&s;try, or to render it di&s;reputable. Money con&s;titutes the &s;inews of war; numbers, the &s;trength of a country; and indu&s;try, its wealth. But a &s;pirit of di&s;&s;i|pation de&s;troys the latter, relaxes the other, and cuts off the &s;inews of the former.</P>
<P>HOW nece&s;&s;ary to regard time, &s;ea&s;on; and mea&s;ure in plea&s;ures and amu&s;ements! Strong and eager is the propen&s;ity to the&s;e; and great vigilance is requi&s;ite to guard again&s;t their delu&s;ive influence. He, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions are in a continual ferment, cannot look thro the &s;ober eye of rea&s;on, nor hear its milder voice thro the buzz of tumultuary plea&s;ures. Whereas he, who mingles plea&s;ures in a temperate &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion with the higher bu&s;ine&s;s of life, pre&s;erves the ma&s;tery of him&s;elf, and is able to make a ju&s;t di&s;tribution of his time

between the employments and the amu&s;e|ments of life; between the concerns of the pre&s;ent, and a proper regard to the intere&s;ts of the future world. Accu&s;tom|ed to contemplate nobler objects, and to ta&s;te more rational enjoyments, young Mr. Bloom&s;grove meets amu&s;ements with a manly indifference; and, by the habits of &s;elf command, is guarded again&s;t exce&s;s, and prepared for every occurrence.</P>
<P>A YOUNG gentleman, who has no &s;y&s;|tem of conduct, with reference to a&s;&s;ociat|ing with others, is in danger of being en|&s;nared by the time, place or manner of &s;ocial enjoyments. If he &s;uffers him&s;elf to be led into places con&s;ecrated to the in|fernal demon of debauchery, he &s;oon finds him&s;elf on enchanted ground. The example of others, the ardor of his own pa&s;&s;ions, excited by the fa&s;cinating influ|ence of vicious indulgencies, give him a licen&s;e he never before felt. All moral re&s;traints, being bantered and ridiculed, &s;oon appear to him as the idle dreams of &s;uper&s;tition. This barrier broken down,
<PB N="266" REF="022570_0563_0FB98AA78C408D08">
he lo&s;es his innocence, and with that his peace of mind.</P>
<P>BESIDES the character of a&s;&s;ociates, re|gard &s;hould be had to time and &s;ea&s;on for &s;ocial plea&s;ures. Confu&s;ion and ruin mu&s;t attend the affairs of that man, who devotes tho&s;e hours to company, in which his bu&s;ine&s;s calls his attention. Compa|ny, bu&s;ine&s;s, and reading or &s;tudy, &s;hould &s;ucceed each other at proper intervals. The&s;e &s;hould be &s;o conducted, as not to interfere with the duties of life. He, who can find no enjoyment in di&s;charging the duties of life, will not long be happy. To a vacant mind, company may afford a temporary relief; but he will be &s;o much the more oppre&s;&s;ed and languid, when forced to return to him&s;elf. By a due mixture of public and private life, or of &s;ociety and bu&s;ine&s;s, young Mr. Bloom&s;|grove kept free from the &s;nares of both, and enjoyed each to much greater perfec|tion.</P>

<P>THE affairs of Mr. Bloom&s;grove's nephew made it nece&s;&s;ary for him to go, and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his patrimonial e&s;|tate in a neighboring county, where he was to &s;ettle.

<P>NOR was the nephew the only member of which this happy family was &s;oon to be deprived.

<P>THE con&s;ent of her patrons evinced their affection to him; while the reluc|tance, with which they parted with Fan|ny, &s;hewed the &s;trength of their regard for her. After pa&s;&s;ing two weeks in re|ceiving the attentions of her numerous friends and acquaintance, the day of their departure arrived.

appearance. To an enlightened under&s;tanding, he unites a liberal mind. To good &s;en&s;e, he unites good nature; to magnanimity, a compa&s;&s;ionate heart; to &s;obriety, cheerfulne&s;s; and to &s;trict vir|tue, elegant accompli&s;hments, and the mo&s;t graceful manners. Affable and courteous towards all, he was held in high e&s;timation by all who knew him.</P>
<P>FOR his intimates, he cho&s;e the wi&s;e and virtuous; having no reli&s;h for com|pany of an oppo&s;ite character. Encour|aged by his father's attention to his young friends, (for they were always received by him with an open hearted cheerfulne&s;s) he enjoyed their company, without &s;eeking it at places of public re&s;ort. He was not de&s;titute of all reli&s;h for amu&s;ements; but he enjoyed much greater plea&s;ure in the &s;ociety of a circle of &s;entimental ladies, and with &s;ome literary friends, than in the u&s;ual amu&s;ements of young people.</P>
<P>HAVING been trained to diligence and application, the habits of indu&s;try were &s;o fixed that he became a great economi&s;t of
<PB N="272" REF="022570_0569_0FB98AB68F7D58E8">
his time. His ta&s;te for agriculture and the mechanic arts, was a &s;ource of plea&s;|ure and amu&s;ement, as well as of exer|ci&s;e, to him. He found an agreeable ex|erci&s;e in the u&s;e of the mechanical tools which he procured for that purpo&s;e. He not only gained a theoretical acquaint|ance with the arts, but became a proficient in the practice of &s;ome of the mo&s;t u&s;eful arts. "Czar Peter worked as a common &s;hip carpenter in the yard, and &s;erved as a drummer in his own troops." Mr. Bloom&s;grove did not think it beneath his &s;on to be acquainted with the u&s;e of tools, or to &s;pend &s;ome time with the workmen, as well for improvement as for exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay what revolutions of fortune may take place; and what ad|vantage this acquaintance with &s;ecular af|fairs may be to him in future. Be&s;ides the contingencies of life, which may make &s;uch knowledge nece&s;&s;ary, it will render him le&s;s dependent on others, and more able to help him&s;elf; and it gave him an opportunity of contracting an acquaint|ance

with a cla&s;s of people, by far the mo&s;t numerous in all communities: and by the&s;e means he gained a more perfect knowledge of human nature, than is po&s;&s;i|ble for tho&s;e who keep them&s;elves aloof from them.</P>
<P>WHAT can be more ridiculous than the airs which &s;ome young gentlemen put on towards tho&s;e who have been trained up in a different&mdash;a &s;uppo&s;ed humbler&mdash; walk in life from them&s;elves?

<P>IN carrying on an occupation or ex|erci&s;ing a profe&s;&s;ion, much is depending on the place cho&s;en for the purpo&s;e, and on the manner of entering upon the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of life. A father's aid and coun&s;el can never be better applied than in this critical and important tran&s;action. Young Mr. Bloom&s;grove, having e&s;tabli&s;hed him|&s;elf under the patronage of the be&s;t of
<PB N="275" REF="022570_0572_0FB98ABD855D8130">
fathers, began to think of a&s;&s;uming the do|me&s;tic &s;tate. But in a tran&s;action, on which the happine&s;s of life &s;o much de|pended, he determined to profit by the wi&s;dom and experience of his father.</P>
<P>TAUGHT, from childhood, to revere his father's judgment, he li&s;tened attentively to all he &s;aid on the &s;ubject of choo&s;ing a companion for life. Mr. Bloom&s;grove does not object to early marriages; but advi&s;es that, when a young man is &s;ettled in bu&s;ine&s;s, and has the means of &s;upport|ing a family, with the exertions of indu&s;|try, he &s;hould look out for a &s;uitable com|panion. Many and great are the advan|tages of early marriages in young coun|tries.</P>
<P>I CAN promi&s;e you, my &s;on, &s;aid Mr. Bloom&s;grove, upon the general experience of all wi&s;e and prudent men, that, if you make a judicious choice, you will not have rea&s;on to repent the &s;tep you take; but every thing is depending on that choice. In placing your affections upon a lady, to be the partner of your days, employ your
<PB N="276" REF="022570_0573_0FB98ABF89D55580">
rea&s;on and judgment, as well as your fancy. Suffer not your&s;elf to be taken by &s;urpri&s;e, but pre&s;erve the ma&s;tery of your affections.</P>
<P>IF you are not well upon your guard, you will fall a prey to beauty, or &s;ome other external qualification, which will be of little con&s;equence in the matrimonial &s;tate. Beauty is a dangerous property, as it tends to corrupt the mind; and it &s;oon lo&s;es its influence. But good &s;en&s;e and &s;weetne&s;s of temper, united to an a|greeable figure and engaging manners, are durable qualities; and never lo&s;e their in|fluence, like beauty. Con&s;ider that the happine&s;s of the married &s;tate does not depend on fortune, birth, or beauty; nor on any external qualification, &s;eparate from the properties of the mind. The management of dome&s;tic affairs and the education of a family, are duties of an in|di&s;pen&s;able nature in a married woman. But as the cheerful di&s;charge of the&s;e du|ties, and the happine&s;s thence re&s;ulting, depend upon a certain degree of corre&s;|pondence
<PB N="277" REF="022570_0574_0FB98AC10079F6A8">
of character and circum&s;tances in the parties, &s;o, in forming this connex|ion, regard &s;hould be had to them.</P>
<P>IN order to en&s;ure permanent affection and harmony, there &s;hould be &s;uch a gen|eral &s;imilarity of age, natural temper, ed|ucation, external accompli&s;hments, and religious &s;entiments, as that the difference in them, may leave no impediments in the way of the tendere&s;t affection and mo&s;t perfect harmony.</P>
<P>A YOUNG man, who has profited by in|&s;tructions like the&s;e, will not be captivat|ed by a pretty face, a &s;prightly air, or any external accompli&s;hment. "The picture of a good wife is fixed in his mind; and he compares with it every young woman he &s;ees:&mdash;'She is pretty, but has &s;he good &s;en&s;e? She has &s;en&s;e, but is &s;he well tem|pered? She dances elegantly, or &s;ings with expre&s;&s;ion; but is &s;he not vain of &s;uch trifles?"</P>
<P>MR. Bloom&s;grove did not wi&s;h to con|trol his &s;on with re&s;pect to the particular object; but to point out the character
<PB N="278" REF="022570_0575_0FB98AC29D4DD0D8">

I need only to ob&s;erve, therefore, that Au|gu&s;ta, to whom he was united in marriage in the twenty fifth year of his age, was the daughter of re&s;pectable parents, who had paid great attention to her education. She was more di&s;tingui&s;hed by her good &s;en&s;e than by her beauty, tho equalled by few in per&s;onal figure. Mild and gentle in her temper, with a heart &s;en&s;ible to the

mi&s;eries of others, and always ready to re|lieve them, &s;he was engaging in her man|ners. The plea&s;ing, as well as more ele|vated qualities, were &s;o happily blended in her compo&s;ition as to make her, at once, tender, &s;prightly, and agreeable, and to render her worthy of &s;o amiable and excellent an hu&s;band.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>"HER's the mild lu&s;tre of the ri&s;ing morn,</L>

<P>IN a relation, of all others the mo&s;t tender and endearing, they ob&s;erved a line of conduct which prevented all the ill effects of di&s;cordant pa&s;&s;ions.

On the other hand, the native delicacy of her &s;ex led her to treat her hu&s;band with that kind re&s;pect which was due to his character: a tribute prompted by nature, not exacted on his part!</P>

<P>FRIENDSHIP is a principal &s;ource of the plea&s;ures of life. It is founded in the &s;ociability of our nature, and con&s;i&s;ts in a reciprocity of affections, which have been accu&s;tomed to &s;acrifice immediate gratification to the hope or enjoyment of high participated plea&s;ures. The&s;e plea&s;|ures are the mo&s;t highly flavored of any enjoyments in life; and without them all others are ta&s;tele&s;s. If we pur&s;ue plea&s;|ure, we cannot enjoy it alone. Without a friend, to whom we may communicate with freedom, our knowledge would afford no plea&s;ure; wealth would be&s;tow no happine&s;s, and every &s;ituation would be joyle&s;s. In pro&s;perity, a friend multiplies

Truth, honor, integrity, and &s;incerity, are e&s;&s;ential ingredients in friend|&s;hip; and to be deficient in the&s;e, is to want capacity for this connexion. Friend|&s;hips, formed at random, and regulated by intere&s;t or convenience, &s;eldom afford a permanent connexion. Hence complaints of ingratitude and incon&s;tancy frequent|ly ari&s;e. Of what importance, then, is a proper and judicious choice of friends? What an acqui&s;ition, a real friend!

E&s;pecially, is it a le&s;&s;on of great importance in a &s;tate of preparation for the duties of conjugal af|fection. When the conjugal relation is formed, upon the principles of true friend|&s;hip and real love, no adver&s;e circum|&s;tances can ever de&s;troy the attachment; nor any temptations lead to a violation of the &s;acred bonds.

<P>THE following &s;tory, related in a Vien|na paper of July, 1788, which is &s;aid to have taken place in the camp before Bel|grade, affords a &s;triking &s;pecimen of the &s;trength of &s;uch friend&s;hips.</P>
<P>"ACHMET Marowa was the &s;on of an eminent magi&s;trate of that city, with great merit and fine accompli&s;hments. He had long addre&s;&s;ed Fatima, the only daughter of Ha&s;&s;an Buglo, a Ba&s;haw in the armies of the Porte, and on the morning of the day on which the &s;iege of Belgrade com|menced, led, exulting to the altar of Alla, one of the lovelie&s;t women of the empire. Mo&s;t of the di&s;tingui&s;hed families of the place, on the approach of the imperial troops, retired to Barrowza, and other places further down the Danube; but the nuptials of Achmet and Fatima, and the rapid movement of our forces, prevented that, otherwi&s;e fortunate pair, from tak|ing
<PB N="286" REF="022570_0583_0FB98AD541D3ED10">
&s;helter in the interior country till the inve&s;tment of the city was complete.</P>
<P>"ON the night of the fourth of June, however, Achmet determined at all haz|ards to convey his bride from the immi|nent perils to which &s;he would be expo&s;ed during a &s;iege that threatened &s;cenes of carnage. He had her dre&s;&s;ed as a young man of fa&s;hion; and putting him&s;elf in the habit of a &s;lave, left the city at twelve o'clock at night, hoping to avoid our guards, and to reach a place of &s;afety be|fore the return of day. Unhappily for the wanderers, they had &s;carce begun their midnight meander, when loud peals of thunder appalled the heart of the di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed Fatima; torrents of rain &s;ucceed|ed, the darkne&s;s increa&s;ed, the fugitives wandered about bewildered and forlorn, till, upon the gleam of day, they found them&s;elves &s;urrounded by a patrolling party of Hungarian Hu&s;&s;ars, and were hurried to the main guard.</P>
<P>"THE Prince of Cobourg having notice given him immediately, that a youth of
<PB N="287" REF="022570_0584_0FB98AD6DEA5D340">
apparent di&s;tinction, attended by a &s;lave, was taken in his camp, ordered them to be kept apart; and if, on examination, any circum&s;tance occurred that &s;hould mark them as &s;pies, that their execution &s;hould take place in&s;tantly. To the interroga|tions that were put to Fatima, &s;he replied that &s;he was the &s;on of a merchant of Bel|grade, and attended by a poor dome&s;tic of her father, and only wi&s;hed to join her family at a village at about ten leagues di&s;tant. She, however, was &s;oon given to under&s;tand, that the manner of their being taken precluded all apologies from having the effect &s;he wi&s;hed; and that the rigid u&s;ages of war allowed her but half an hour to live. She received this dreadful information without manife&s;ting any perturbation, and only begged that her &s;lave might be permitted to carry her friends a few remembrances that &s;he particularized.</P>
<P>"WHILE &s;he was clo&s;ing this reque&s;t, &s;he beheld the beloved Achmet, &s;urround|ed by armed men, pa&s;&s;ing the door of the
<PB N="288" REF="022570_0585_0FB98ADA1516B268">
tent &s;he was in. As &s;he had not doubted of his &s;afety, from the &s;ervility of his ap|pearance, &s;he inquired in an agony of agitation what was to be his fate? and was an&s;wered&mdash;'immediate death.' At the word DEATH &s;he &s;hrieked out, and fell from her &s;eat in convul&s;ions. The officers around her flew to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and, to give her free re&s;piration, unbut|toned her wai&s;tcoat; when, to their a|mazement, they found their unhappy pri&s;oner a lady.</P>
<P>"THE execution of Achmet was &s;u&s;|pended, until the Prince of Cobourg could be informed of the&s;e particulars. The generous chieftain examined each of them apart, and received &s;uch informa|tion, as convinced him that they were not the in&s;idious agents he had &s;u&s;pected. The heroic Fatima and her hu&s;band were furni&s;hed with habits befitting their real &s;ituations, and before the clo&s;e of the day, &s;afely e&s;corted to the village whither their de&s;pairing friends had retired."</P>

<P>THE education of a daughter can|not be con&s;idered as at an end, &s;o long as &s;he continues in a &s;ingle &s;tate. In&s;truc|tions preparatory to marriage have been con&s;idered, by writers on education, as of the greate&s;t con&s;equence in bringing child|ren forward into life.</P>
<P>THE fondne&s;s, which mothers have &s;ometimes di&s;covered, for precipitating their daughters' appearance on the pub|lic theatre, has been the &s;ource of many mortifications. Unacquainted with the world, young and volatile, they &s;ome|times fall a prey to di&s;honorable preten|&s;ions; and &s;uch is the delicacy of the fe|male character, that the foul breath of &s;u&s;picion may &s;tain it, but all the &s;treams that flow can never re&s;tore its former lu&s;tre: or, incapable of making a prudent choice, they be&s;tow them&s;elves on an un|worthy object, and owe a whole life of inquietude and &s;orrow to a &s;ingle ra&s;h and indi&s;creet action. Here a prudent

<P>"MOTHERS and nur&s;es, &s;ays Lord Kaimes, are continually talking of mar|riage to their female pupils, long before it is &s;ugge&s;ted to them by nature; and it is always a great e&s;tate, a fine coat, or a gay equipage that is promi&s;ed. Such objects impre&s;&s;ed on the mind of a child, natur|ally bia&s;s her to a wrong choice, when &s;he grows up." But Mrs. Bloom&s;grove has never &s;poken to her daughter upon that &s;ubject, till &s;ince &s;he has arrived at mature age; and, indeed, the habits of di&s;cretion have become &s;o fixed, by her manage|ment with her from childhood, as to &s;u|per&s;ede the nece&s;&s;ity of much in&s;truction on the &s;ubject at this period. The whole of her education has been preparatory to the duties, connexions, and changes of life.</P>
<P>BUT as her age, and the attentions which &s;he now receives from many young
<PB N="291" REF="022570_0588_0FB98ADEFB356110">
gentlemen, indicate the propriety of &s;ome preparatory in&s;truction, Mrs. Bloom&s;grove lets no favorable opportunity &s;lip, of dropping &s;uch hints, as &s;he thinks may be u&s;eful. Her main object is, without giv|ing any direct in&s;tructions, to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s the mind of Rozella in favor of the char|acter, rather than the appearance of a man. She repre&s;ents the happine&s;s of the married &s;tate, as depending more on the good temper, &s;obriety, and indu&s;try of an hu&s;band, than on any particular cir|cum&s;tances of intere&s;t, or outward appear|ance; that men of good morals are the only true admirers of females; that, tho they may not have all the ful&s;ome jargon of gallantry, yet that their a&s;&s;iduities are more &s;incere and more tender.</P>
<P>THAT permanent affection, which lays the only &s;ure foundation of connubial bli&s;s, is &s;o far from being bought or &s;old, that money frequently de&s;troys it. Never con&s;ider, my dear, &s;aid Mrs. Bloom&s;grove to her daughter, what the e&s;tate is valued at, but attend to the character of the per|&s;on;
<PB N="292" REF="022570_0589_0FB98AE4E1CC8AC8">
and the only &s;ure way of judging of a man's character, is from the figure he makes among his own &s;ex. The pre&s;ump|tion is, that men are be&s;t able to judge of one anothers merits. Accu&s;tomed to le&s;s delicacy and re&s;erve than the female &s;ex, a man's character may be very preci&s;ely a&s;certained from his male a&s;&s;ociates; e&s;|pecially his temper and di&s;po&s;ition, upon which the happine&s;s of the married &s;tate depends much more than on any outward circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>MUTUAL affection is e&s;&s;ential to recip|rocal enjoyment; but where the moral plea&s;ures of love do not exi&s;t, what &s;ecuri|ty can either have, that a virtuous attach|ment, which will warrant an entire confi|dence, exi&s;ts between them? The per&s;on may remain the fame, but if the pa&s;&s;ion decays, it is no longer viewed in the &s;ame light. The veil of delu&s;ion falls off, and love takes its flight. In order to guard her daughter again&s;t the danger of making a ra&s;h choice, &s;he conver&s;es on marriage as an hazardous &s;tep to a female, becau&s;e an
<PB N="293" REF="022570_0590_0FB98AE646EE0088">
error in choo&s;ing an hu&s;band admits of no remedy. Every &s;tep towards that &s;hould be taken with caution.</P>
<P>THE great object of female education, thro the whole cour&s;e of it, &s;hould be to qualify females for the important &s;tation they are to hold in dome&s;tic &s;ociety, and to make them u&s;eful and agreeable compan|ions in the matrimonial &s;tate. Dome&s;tic concerns are the province of the wife; and nature prompts young women to qual|ify them&s;elves for behaving well in that &s;tation: and the influence of the female character over the manners of men, both before and after marriage, exhibits female education in a point of light extremely intere&s;ting.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>"LET the ladies of a country be properly educat|ed, and they will not only make and admini&s;ter its laws, but form its manners and character.</P>
<P>"IT would require a lively imagination to de&s;cribe, or even to comprehend, the happine&s;s of a country, where knowledge and virtue were generally diffu&s;ed among the female &s;ex. Our young men would then be re&s;trained from vice, by the terror of being bani&s;h|ed from their company. The loud laugh, and the ma|lignant &s;mile, at the expen&s;e of innocence, or of per|&s;onal infirmities; the &s;eats of &s;ucce&s;sful mimickry, and the low prized wit, which is borrowed from a mi&s;appli|cation of &s;cripture phra&s;es, would no more be con&s;id|ered as a recommendation to the &s;ociety of the ladies. A double entendre, in their pre&s;ence, would then ex|clude a gentleman forever from the company of both &s;exes.</P>
<P>"THE influence of female education, would be &s;till more exten&s;ive and u&s;eful in dome&s;tic life. The obli|gations of gentlemen to qualify them&s;elves, by knowl|edge and indu&s;try, to di&s;charge the duties of benevo|lence, would be increa&s;ed by marriage; and the pat|riot, the hero, and the legi&s;lator, would find the &s;weet|e&s;t reward of their toil in the approbation and applau&s;e of their wives. Children would di&s;cover the marks of maternal prudence and wi&s;dom in every &s;tation in life; for it has been well remarked that there have been few great, or good men, who have not been ble&s;&s;|ed with wi&s;e and prudent mothers. Cyrus was taught by his mother Mandane, to revere the Gods. Samuel was devoted to his prophetic office, before he was born, by his mother Hannah. Con&s;tantine was re&s;cued from pagani&s;m by his mother Con&s;tantia: and Edward the &s;ixth inherited tho&s;e great and excellent qualities, which made him the delight of the age in which he lived, from his mother Lady Jane Seymour."</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XCIII.</HEAD>
<P>IT is now time, my dear &s;ir, to col|lect the detached traits of female excel|lence, which, like the &s;cattered rays of the fair morning that tinge the mountain tops with their golden hue, when drawn to a point, will afford a beautiful a&s;&s;emblage of colors. I &s;hall only aim at collecting the principal features of Rozella's charac|ter, and will pre&s;ent you with her portrait, as drawn by the hand of nature and of ed|ucation.</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="022570_0592_0FB98AE98B84F598">IN the fir&s;t rank of her virtues, I &s;hall place that re&s;pectful attention with which &s;he treats her parents. Often does the tear of maternal affection &s;tart from Mrs. Bloom&s;grove's eye, at beholding the a&s;&s;i|duity and re&s;pect with which her daugh|ter endeavors to reward a mother's care. The love of virtue is Rozella's ruling pa&s;&s;ion. She loves it, not only on ac|count of its native excellence, and of its being the only &s;ure road to happine&s;s; but on account of its being dear to her re&s;pectable father and tender mother. Her &s;en&s;ibility is too great for an undi&s;|turbed
<PB N="296" REF="022570_0593_0FB98AED1140EA78">
enjoyment; but is &s;uch as to af|ford the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite plea&s;ure in reliev|ing the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed. "We &s;ometimes &s;ee in&s;tances of young ladies, who weep away a whole forenoon, over the criminal &s;or|rows of a fictitious Charlotte or Werter, turning, with di&s;dain, at two o'clock, from the fight of a beggar, who &s;olicits in hum|ble accents or &s;igns, a &s;mall portion only of the crumbs which fall from their fa|ther's tables." But Rozella never &s;uf|fered any one to go unrelieved, to whom &s;he could afford relief.</P>
<P>ROZELLA is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uperior un|der&s;tanding; but &s;he endeavors to con|ceal that &s;uperiority with as much care, as many take to di&s;play the &s;uperiority they have not. She conforms to the company &s;he is in; and never offends any by a di&s;play of talents greatly above theirs. She is cheerful with the merry, &s;erious with the grave, and &s;ilent with the ab&s;urd. To good nature &s;he unites good breeding: is therefore, polite without ceremony, and obliging without o&s;tenta|tion.
<PB N="297" REF="022570_0594_0FB98AF09E04D080">
Rozella never talks of her own &s;ex but to expre&s;s the good &s;he knows of them; and never &s;uffers &s;lander or detraction to e&s;cape from her lips. She experiences le&s;s pain, from the wrong &s;he receives, than from that which &s;he does.</P>
<P>ROZELLA prepares for managing a fam|ily of her own, by a&s;&s;i&s;ting her mother in the care of hers. She is well acquainted with cookery, and with the price and qual|ity of provi&s;ions; and &s;he can do the honors of the table with dignity and pro|priety. While &s;he continued the delight|ful companion of her mother, &s;he reigned in the hearts of all the &s;ervants, to whom &s;he always &s;poke in the kinde&s;t manner; received the benedictions of the poor, and the merited applau&s;e of all who knew her.</P>
<P>THE per&s;onal charms of Rozella allure many young gentlemen to &s;eek her com|pany. She has that &s;weetne&s;s of counte|nance, which intere&s;ts without dazzling beholders. Her &s;prightly and &s;entimental conver&s;ation (for &s;he never, of choice,
<PB N="298" REF="022570_0595_0FB98AF1C17AFF70">
con&s;umed her time over an unmeaning card table) renders her a mo&s;t agreeable and entertaining companion, e&s;pecially to her intimate acquaintance; for, in pre&s;|ence of &s;trangers, a mode&s;t re&s;erve, blend|ed with that native frankne&s;s which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">nders her ea&s;y and graceful, ca&s;ts a tran&s;parent veil over her mental accompli&s;hments, which, while it &s;eems to conceal, di&s;plays them to the be&s;t advantage.</P>
<P>AND while Rozella's per&s;onal qualities, graceful manners, and &s;entimental con|ver&s;ation, attract and plea&s;e the gentle|men, her virtues teach them to re&s;pect her character. The vicious and profane are awed by her white robed innocence, and never profane its purity in her pre&s;|ence. Great is her influence over the mora's of tho&s;e who have the honor of a&s;|&s;ociating with her. Her empire is at|tendant on her virtues; her gentlene&s;s and mode&s;ty confirm the &s;way. In her company, the rude&s;t and mo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible of men will abate their ferocity, and will affect more engaging manners. Her
<PB N="299" REF="022570_0596_0FB98AF9A080A9D8">
beauty &s;eems but a proper and decent lodging for her mind; it never makes her unmindful of her &s;ex nor of her age. Her mode&s;t diffidence intere&s;ts every one in her favor, and &s;he draws that re&s;pect and attention to her&s;elf which &s;he pays to the company.</P>
<P>YOU will naturally conclude, my dear &s;ir, that a young lady, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o many accompli&s;hments, did not remain long up|on the &s;tage without offers of marriage. The deep rooted habits of education had taught her to move with caution, and never to decide on an important matter, till her judgment had gained an a&s;cend|ency over her fancy. She was not to be deluded by the a&s;&s;iduities of ful&s;ome gal|lantry, by the pageantry of wealth, nor by the fal&s;e lu&s;tre of beauty, elegance, or any external accompli&s;hments. Nor could any of her admirers gain a favorable reception, till the young Augu&s;tus, &s;on of an eminent planter, made an offer of him|&s;elf in marriage.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="022570_0597_0FB988A39DA3FF58">THE offer of &s;o elegant a per&s;on, with a mind uncorrupted by vice, enlightened by exten&s;ive &s;cience, dignified by the mo&s;t amiable virtues, and embelli&s;hed by grace|ful manners, was not to be declined. To him &s;he li&s;tened with a plea&s;ure before unexperienced: and, with the perfect ap|probation of her parents, her friends, and her own heart, the happy Augu&s;tus called the lovely, the excellent, the accompli&s;hed Rozella HIS, in the twenty &s;econd year of her age.</P>
