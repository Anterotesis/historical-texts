<P>THere is &s;ome thing in my Mind to Write, in Me|mory of that Dear Innocent Soul <HI>Hannah Hill,</HI> jun. Who Departed this Life about the Eleventh Year of her Age, in Peace with God, and in great Love and Unity with his People, and in much A&s;&s;urance of her own Eternal Happyne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="001884_0030_0FB9C4C6AB912320">I Was well Acquainted with this tender Young Maiden, for &s;everal Years before &s;he dyed, and I took good notice of her Conver&s;ation, and the more by how much it was bright and &s;hin|ing, in that which is commendable in Youth. Oh! (&s;aith my Soul) that the <HI>Youth of our Age</HI> and this City might follow her Example! &s;he was a pat|tern of Piety, Plainne&s;s and Obedience to Parents, and of a Womanly and Obliging temper unto all.</P>
<P>It was my Lot (for which I have many times been truly thankful) to be for &s;ome Months a Co-habiter in the Family, and I Ob&s;erved that &s;he was always very Dutiful to her Parents, Loving to her Friends and Neighbours, and kind to the Servants, both White and Black. I have &s;een &s;ome Children very Rude and Imperious to their Pa|rents, Negroes&punc; but I ob&s;erved the con|trary in her; And Doubtle&s;s, it is a

Great and Crying Sin, in either Old or Young to abu&s;e poor Slaves.</P>
<P>I al&s;o Ob&s;erved, That many times when other Children would be at Play in the Streets, (the which our <HI>Youth</HI> are too much addicted to in this City, and too much Winked at by their Pa|rents) &s;he would be either at her Book or her Needle, at both which &s;he was very Dexterous, and it rather &s;eemed a Delight to her, than a Burden.</P>
<P>She could Write well, and would Indite Letters&punc; that were full of Inteli|gence, her Conver&s;ation, that Way, was very de&s;irable, as well as <HI>Viva Voce.</HI></P>
<P>She had an extraordinary Gift in Rea|ding of the Holy Scriptures, and other Good Books, in which &s;he took much Delight; And if any Friend gave her a Book, &s;he would not &s;eem to be &s;atisfied untill &s;he had Read it through; and would &s;ometimes get much of it by Heart.</P>

One great Virtue I may not omit men|tioning, which would be very Becom|ing in Chri&s;tians of Riper Years, &s;he would oft Sympathize with tho&s;e that were in Affliction, or under Exerci&s;e; Of which my Poor Self was a Feeling Witne&s;s; For when I Buried my Loving and Beloved Wife, after I came home from the Burial, &s;he came to me and took me by the Hand with both hers, and leaned her Head upon my Side, in much Tenderne&s;s of Spirit, which great|ly Affected my Heart at that time, to Con&s;ider, that her Years were &s;o Green and her Soul &s;o Ripe, &s;he being then about nine Years of Age.
