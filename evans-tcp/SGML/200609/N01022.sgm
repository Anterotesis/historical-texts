<P>My hearers, You are come, where you see, the <HI>Glory</HI> of the Lord.</P>
<P N="2">II. In the <HI>Enjoyment</HI> of a CHRIST Appearing to us, as the <HI>Work,</HI> the <HI>Glorious Work</HI> of God, there is laid up the Great Blessedness desired by every Godly Christian. Two Instructions ly plainly before us.</P>
<P>First. Our <HI>Enjoying</HI> of a CHRIST, is in His Appearing to us. Tis by the <HI>Seeing</HI> of a CHRIST, that we come to the <HI>Having</HI> of a CHRIST. Some <HI>En|joyment</HI> of a CHRIST is to be attained
<PB N="19" REF="001219_0019_0FB130C4FB0596B0">
in <HI>this world.</HI> But this <HI>Enjoyment</HI> lies in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Fiducial Sight</HI> of him. Hence we read, Psal. 9. 10. <HI>They that know thy Name will put their trust in thee.</HI> The <HI>Scripture</HI> does Reveal much of a CHRIST unto us; and the <HI>Spirit</HI> which indited the <HI>Scripture</HI> does assist us to <HI>Receive</HI> What the <HI>Scripture</HI> does <HI>Reveal.</HI> We Enjoy a <HI>CHRIST.</HI> when we <HI>Receive</HI> him, and Apprehend the <HI>glorious work</HI> of God in him, as he is tendred unto us, in the E|vangelical Revelation. But the whole and full <HI>Enjoyment</HI> of a <HI>CHRIST,</HI> is not attained, until we come unto <HI>the world that is to come.</HI> And this <HI>Enjoyment</HI> will be in the <HI>Immediate Sight</HI> of him. Hence we read, 1 Joh. 3. 2. <HI>We shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.</HI> There will a Day come, when the <HI>Sun of Righ|teousness</HI> will Irradiate us with his Di|rectest Influences. We shall one Day be in the <HI>presence of the Lord,</HI> and <HI>walk all the Day long in the light of His Coun|tenance:</HI> A Day, when we shall be <HI>pre|sented Faultless before the presence of His Glory with exceeding Joy;</HI> A Day, when we shall <HI>see His Face,</HI> and <HI>the Lord God

<P>Secondly. Every <HI>Godly Christian</HI> ex|pects his Great and Chief Blessedness in this Enjoyment. <Q>Here, <HI>he sayes,</HI> here, Even this is <HI>all my Salvation and all my Desire;</HI> If HE that shall be <HI>the Just Ruler over men,</HI> will please to <HI>shine as the light of the Morning</HI> upon me.</Q> As the Prophet said unto the person that Entertained him, <HI>What shall be done for thee?</HI> I will say it unto the Believer; Christian, <HI>What shall be done for thee?</HI> Wouldest thou have all the <HI>Riches</HI> and <HI>Pleasures</HI> and <HI>Honours</HI> of the Earth heaped upon thee? I know the Reply that such an one will make It is the guise &amp; mark of every Godly Christian, to Cry out with a flaming Soul, as the Martyr did in the Flames, <HI>None but CHRIST! None but CHRIST!</HI> A Godly Christian looks upon <HI>Acquaintance</HI> with a CHRIST, as the <HI>Inchoation</HI> of his Blessedness. He is of that Judgment; Phil. 3. 8. <HI>I count all things but loss, for the Excellency of the

knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord.</HI> He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oks upon <HI>Admission</HI> to a CHRIST, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e <HI>Consummation</HI> of his <HI>Blessedness.</HI> He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of that Judgment; Phil. 1. 23. To <HI>be with Christ, is by far the best of all.</HI> A CHRIST, he is the <HI>light of God.</HI> The Real Christian sayes, <HI>Lord, In thy light, I shall see light: all the light, and all the good, that my Soul can wish for.</HI> A CHRIST, He is the ALL of every sin|cere Christian. He subscribes to that; Col. 3. 11. <HI>Christ is ALL.</HI> His Lan|guage is, <HI>Christus meus et Omnia;</HI> If CHRIST be mine, ALL is mine. The <HI>Alsufficiency</HI> of a CHRIST, is most af|fectionately Celebrated by every serious Christian. We read, Col. 1. 19. <HI>It pleased the Father, that in him should all Fulness dwell.</HI> And it <HI>Pleases,</HI> it Com|forts, it Revives the Christian, to see that <HI>Fulness</HI> in him. He sees that <HI>Al|sufficiency</HI> in a CHRIST, which will yield him Everlasting Satisfaction; that <HI>Wisdom,</HI> and <HI>Righteousness,</HI> and <HI>Holiness,</HI> and <HI>Redemption,</HI> which will answer all of his Necessities. Tell him of, A CHRIST, A CHRIST; his heart even

leaps within him at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound of that Name.

<P N="3">III. Good men who <HI>Enjoy</HI> a CHRIST, are greatly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, That their Children may be partakers with them, in the <HI>Enjoyment</HI> or so great a <HI>Blessed|ness.</HI> All men do Naturally desire a <HI>Blessedness</HI> for their <HI>Children.</HI> There is in Men by Nature, an inexpressible <HI>Stor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ee,</HI> and <HI>Passion,</HI> for the <HI>Blessedness</HI> of their <HI>Children.</HI> Tis a very <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> man, who Enjoyes any <HI>Blessedness,</HI> and Wishes not the like <HI>Enjoyment</HI> for his <HI>Children</HI> too. But now, tis the Distinguishing property of <HI>Good men,</HI> to pitch upon this <HI>Blessedness</HI> for their <HI>Children;</HI> A CHRIST; A CHRIST!
<PB N="23" REF="001219_0023_0FB130CC95ADED40">
Oh, That they may <HI>Know</HI> Christ, and <HI>Love</HI> Christ, and <HI>Serve</HI> Christ, and by a Christ be saved from the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> Sins! THIS is the <HI>Blessedness</HI> chosen by all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ligious Parents, for their <HI>Children,</HI> a thousand times rather than Thousands of Gold and Silver.</P>
<P>First. Good men are very sensible, That without a CHRIST, their <HI>Children</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">re very <HI>Miserable.</HI> As we read 2 Cor. 4. 3. <HI>1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> our Gospel be h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d, it is hid unto them that are lost.</HI> So will all Virtuous Parents conclude; <Q>If a <HI>CHRIST</HI> be <HI>hid</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> from my <HI>Children,</HI> they are <HI>Lost,</HI> they are <HI>Lost;</HI> All the <HI>Gain of the whole world</HI> will not profit them.</Q> Good men re|member, That their <HI>Children</HI> are, <HI>Chil|dren of Death,</HI> and, <HI>Children of Wrath,</HI> and have the Dreadful <HI>Wrath</HI> of God lying upon them. But they also re|member, That none but a CHRIST can deliver them; Tis <HI>JESUS,</HI> who <HI>Delivers from the wrath to come.</HI> Good men remember, That their <HI>Children</HI> are the woful <HI>Slaves</HI> of the <HI>Devil,</HI> who <HI>Leads them Captives to do his will.</HI> But they also remember, That none but a
<PB N="24" REF="001219_0024_0FB130CEBB602A30">
CHRIST, can Redeem them out of their <HI>Slavery:</HI> This is the Lord, who <HI>Re|deems rom all Iniquities.</HI> When one that is a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> of God, has a <HI>Child</HI> bor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> unto him, he thinks, <Q>Alas, If God be|stow not his CHRIST on this <HI>Child</HI> it had been <HI>Good that it never been born.</HI></Q> And Good men have such sentiments about their <HI>Children;</HI> <Q>Better, Better my <HI>Children</HI> should be <HI>cloath'd with Rag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> than be without the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of CHRIST for the <HI>cloathing</HI> and <HI>covering</HI> of their Souls. Better, Better, my <HI>Children</HI> should be <HI>Despised Beggars,</HI> than that they should be <HI>Despisers</HI> of CHRIST, and of his <HI>Great Salvation.</HI> Better, Better, my <HI>Children</HI> should be <HI>Blind,</HI> than that they should be with|out a <HI>Sight</HI> of the worth of a CHRIST. Better they should be <HI>Lame,</HI> than that they should not <HI>Run</HI> to a CHRIST at his Call; better they should be Captives to <HI>Turks,</HI> and <HI>Moors,</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> than that they should not be the <HI>Servants</HI> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST.</Q> Ah, Lord; how can we bear to see them in this Condition?</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="001219_0025_0FB130D028A22920">
Secondly. Good men are very sen|sible, That by <HI>their Means,</HI> their <HI>Chil|dren</HI> are become so very <HI>Miserable.</HI> It was the Law of Equity, Exod. 21. 19. He that wounded another, <HI>shall cause him to be throughly healed.</HI> Now Good men see, that there are Deadly <HI>Wounds</HI> of sin on the Souls of their <HI>Children;</HI> But they Reflect, <HI>Ah! My Child, my Child: It is I that have so cruelly Wounded it!</HI> This Awakens them to study, what they may do, that these <HI>Children</HI> may have a CHRIST, for to heal them of their <HI>Wounds.</HI> Good men see <HI>Original Sin</HI> in their <HI>Children,</HI> which is a <HI>Spring</HI> of all Wickedness and Confusion; An <HI>Evil Frame;</HI> An <HI>Evil Heart;</HI> An <HI>Heart of Stone.</HI> But Good men see, and with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">leeding Bowels own, That their <HI>Chil|dren</HI> have derived from <HI>Them</HI> all this <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">adness,</HI> and are nextly Beholden to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">em</HI> for their <HI>Original Sin.</HI> Quickly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> their Thoughts now fly away to this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">int; <Q>Lord, Let my <HI>Child</HI> have a CHRIST.

Let the <HI>Grace</HI> of thy CHRIST cure my <HI>Child</HI> of the harm, which my Sin has done unto it!</Q></P>
<P>Thirdly. Good men are very sensible, That if their <HI>Children</HI> have a CHRIST, they are then sure of <HI>Blessedness;</HI> they have <HI>Blessedness</HI> enough; they are suf|ficiently and admirably provided for. We read; Rom. 8. 32. <HI>How shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?</HI> Thus will Good men say; <HI>O my God; If thou wilt give thy CHRIST unto my Children, thou wilt in Him give them all things, and what is more than all?</HI> That worthy man <HI>Claviger,</HI> would say, If I may see the <HI>Fear of God</HI> in my Children, <HI>Satis mih<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, satis Filijs et Filia|bus prospexi,</HI> an Ample Provision is made for them.

Seekest thou Great things
<PB N="27" REF="001219_0027_0FB130D312A73CF0">
for them? Seek them not.</HI> The <HI>Children</HI> are very often undone, by having too Large Portions of these Bewitching and Perishing Vanities. It had been well for many <HI>Children,</HI> if they had not been en|dowed with such large Portions, to be the <HI>Fuel</HI> of their Debaucheries. But Good men know, that if their <HI>Children</HI> have a CHRIST, they then have the <HI>Promise, both of the Life that now is, and of that which is to come.</HI> They know, That if their <HI>Children</HI> have a CHRIST, whatever <HI>changes</HI> or <HI>sorrows</HI> come upon them, they shall <HI>all work together for their good.</HI> They know, that if their <HI>Children</HI> have a CHRIST, they shall most certainly be <HI>kept by the mighty Power of God, thro' Faith unto Salvation.</HI> This, this causes them to be in an inexpres|sible Travail of Soul for their <HI>Children,</HI> that an Interest in a CHRIST, an Union with a CHRIST, may be obtained for them.</P>

<P>Once more, Can you hear, that our Great Blessedness lies in the <HI>Enjoy|ment</HI> of a CHRIST; and not resolve, <HI>To be afraid of a Christless condition, as a cursed condition?</HI> Souls, If ever you be <HI>Redeemed</HI> from the <HI>Curse</HI> of God, it must be by the CHRIST of God. You find it said, <HI>Let thy Work appear unto thy SERVANTS.</HI> You are no <HI>Servants of God,</HI> if you tremble not at being <HI>Strangers</HI> to CHRIST.

In a word; In the Enjoyment of a Glorious CHRIST, you will have, what will make up the want of every other Enjoyment! It is a memorable passage, Isa. 9. 1. <HI>At the First time, He made Vile the Land of</HI> Zabulon, <HI>&amp; the Land of</HI> Naphtali; <HI>so in the latter time He shall make it Glo|rious; Even the way of the Sea, beyond</HI> Jor|dan, Galilee <HI>of the Gentiles.</HI> The People of the Countrey here described, were af|flicted with an Early Captivity; The <HI>Assyrian</HI> Captivated them, and committed fearful and bloody Depredations upon them. Well, but sayes our God, I will make them <HI>Amends</HI> for these Afflictions. What <HI>Amends?</HI> It follows, <HI>The People that sat in Darkness have seen a Great Light.</HI> A CHRIST, a CHRIST, coming and shining upon a wretched Countrey makes <HI>Amends</HI> for the most severe Ca|lamities; The Countrey is <HI>Glorified</HI> in such a rare Enjoyment! Are you <HI>Poor?</HI> In a CHRIST, you Enjoy a <HI>Goodly He|ritage.</HI> Are you <HI>Sick?</HI> In a CHRIST you Enjoy the <HI>Saving Health</HI> of God.

<P>If you are Deaf to all these Charms, I will go on, Thirdly, to tell you; That except and until a Glorious CHRIST be yours, you are infinitely miserable. I tell you truly; The most horrible Article of Misery that ever was uttered, is that; Eph. 2. 12. <HI>Without CHRIST.</HI> And I will tell you <HI>Something</HI> about the Misery of them that are <HI>Without</HI> CHRIST: I say, <HI>Something</HI> of it; For, truly to be <HI>without CHRIST,</HI> is to be <HI>beyond all Expression Miserable.</HI></P>
<P>Oh! That the God of all Grace, would cause these things to sink down into the hearts of our <HI>Young People,</HI> and therewith infuse a concern for a CHRIST into them!</P>
<P>First; By our <HI>Fall</HI> from God, we are all become very <HI>Miserable:</HI> And, O my <HI>Young People,</HI> Who but a Glorious CHRIST can Deliver you from the Numberless and Exquisite <HI>Miseries,</HI> into which you
<PB N="44" REF="001219_0044_0FB130F05E2BA9D0">
are Fallen? It is most sure, that by our <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Fall,</HI> we have made our selves miserable Creatures. We have <HI>Sinned;</HI> and our Lamentation may be that; Lam. 5. 16. <HI>Wo unto us, that we have Sinned. Children;</HI> You have Sinned, and you are <HI>Estranged</HI> from God, you are <HI>Ab|horred</HI> by God; surely, this is to be very <HI>Miserable!</HI> You have Sinned, and you are sunk into an <HI>Ignorance</HI> of God, into an <HI>Enmity</HI> to God; surely this is to be very <HI>Miserable!</HI> You have Sinned, and your <HI>Minds</HI> are Infected, your <HI>Wills</HI> are Depraved, your <HI>Affections</HI> are all out of Order; the <HI>Powers of Darkness</HI> hold you in <HI>Chains of Darkness.</HI> And is not this to be very <HI>Miserable?</HI> Every one of you is a <HI>Sinner;</HI> and the Voice of every <HI>Sinner</HI> may be that; Rom. 7. 24. <HI>Oh! Wretched one that I am; who shall Deliver me!</HI> Now, if you have a CHRIST, you have a <HI>Deliverer.</HI> But if you are without a CHRIST, <HI>Oh! Wretched Ones that you are; you have none to Deliver you!</HI> Could you Deliver your selves from your Miseries, or could any one else Deliver you; Then to
<PB N="45" REF="001219_0045_0FB130F1CE182F50">
be without a CHRIST, would not be so Miserable. But, Isa. 10. 3. <HI>What will you do in the Day of Visitation? To whom will you flee for Help?</HI> Saith the Lord; <HI>Without me</HI> they shall Perish a|mong the <HI>Prisoners</HI> of Desperation. What will become of a stung <HI>Israelite,</HI> if he look not unto the healing Ser|pent? We read, Act. 4. 12. <HI>There is not Salvation in any other.</HI> None of all your Miseries would ly upon you, if you had a CHRIST concerned for the relieving and removing thereof. But while you are without a CHRIST, all your Miseries continue unrelieved and unremoved World without end. All our <HI>Help</HI> is laid upon a CHRIST. Ah, Christless One! Ah, Helpless One! What will become of thee.</P>
<P>Secondly. To be without a Glorious CHRIST, is to be under the <HI>Guilt of Sin,</HI> But then, Behold, my Young Peo|ple, Behold, how <HI>Miserable!</HI> If it could be said, Psal. 32. 1. 2. <HI>Blessed is the man whose Transgression is Forgiven, and whose Sin is Covered; Blessed is the man
<PB N="46" REF="001219_0046_0FB130F499A48788">
unto whom the Lord Imputeth not Iniqui|ty;</HI> Then it must be said, <HI>Undone</HI> is the man, to whom the Lord <HI>Imputeth Iniquity.</HI> But so <HI>Undone</HI> art thou, O Young Man, if thou art a <HI>Christless</HI> one. It is a <HI>Miserable</HI> thing to be under the <HI>Guilt</HI> of sin. But he that is <HI>Christless</HI> cannot be <HI>Guiltless.</HI> It was said, 1 Cor. 15. 17. <HI>If Christ be not Raised, ye are yet in your Sins.</HI> And it may be said, <HI>If Christ be not yours, ye are yet in your Sins.</HI> While a man is without a Glori|ous CHRIST, he is <HI>Unjustified;</HI> for every Unbeliever is <HI>Unjustified;</HI> We are <HI>Justified by Faith.</HI> We read, Joh. 3. 18. <HI>He that Believeth not, is Condemned already.</HI> The Violated Law of God, has passed a sentence of Condemnation upon the sinner. None but a CHRIST can make satisfaction to the Violated <HI>Law;</HI> And he has done it for those that are in him. He that is without a CHRIST, is himself under obligation to satisfy the <HI>Law</HI> of God for him|self; he is obliged in dreadful Bonds to become a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> unto the formi|dable Justice of God. Oh! <HI>Miserable
<PB N="47" REF="001219_0047_0FB130F6577CD140">
Plight!</HI> We read Rom. 8. 1. <HI>There is no Condemnation to those that are in CHRIST.</HI> But horribly <HI>Condemned</HI> are they that are without a CHRIST. There is no way for a sinner to come at a <HI>Pardon,</HI> but by the <HI>Atonement</HI> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST. His only Plea is, That the <HI>Blood</HI> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST has made <HI>Atonement</HI> for him. A sinner has no way to be|come <HI>Righteous,</HI> but by having the <HI>Righ|teousness</HI> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST placed unto his Account. He must plead, That the Lord JESUS CHRIST has <HI>fulfilled all Righteousness</HI> on his be|half. He that is without a <HI>CHRIST,</HI> is without that <HI>Atonement,</HI> without that <HI>Righteousness.</HI> O Young People, If you are <HI>Christless,</HI> Let these Thoughts force themselves in upon you, <Q>Any <HI>One Sin</HI> lying upon me, were enough to make me for ever <HI>Miserable.</HI> But, What shall I do? Where shall I fly? That have been Guilty of Thousands of <HI>Sins,</HI> and every one of them all <HI>Un|pardoned</HI> unto this moment! Oh!

my <HI>Unpardoned Soul:</HI> Thou art a most <HI>Miserable Soul.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Thirdly. Can the dreadful <HI>Wrath</HI> &amp; <HI>Curse</HI> of God, make any person <HI>Mi|serable?</HI> Then, O Young People, To be without a CHRIST, is to be <HI>Mi|serable. Sin, Sin,</HI> has laid us all under the <HI>Wrath</HI> and <HI>Curse</HI> of God. While we are without a CHRIST, we are without Him, who bore the <HI>Wrath</HI> and <HI>Curse</HI> for His People, and who alone can Redeem us from that <HI>Wrath</HI> and <HI>Curse.</HI> A <HI>Christless</HI> person is under the <HI>Wrath</HI> of God. We read, Joh. 3. 36. <HI>The Wrath of God abideth on him.</HI> He is under the <HI>Curse</HI> of God. We read, Deut. 28. 15. <HI>All the Curses shall come upon thee, and overtake thee.</HI></P>
<P>Miserable sinner; The <HI>Wrath</HI> of God like a Consuming Fire, is burning against him. The Great GOD is <HI>every Day Angry</HI> at him. There is the Anger of God, in all His Dispensations towards him. Nothing that he does is pleasing to God. He Languishes perpetually under the Displeasure of God. He is

a <HI>Child of Wrath;</HI> he is obnoxious to that Wrath, at which, you Quake, <HI>O ye Mountains,</HI> you Melt, <HI>O ye Hills,</HI> you are Thrown down, <HI>O ye Rocks;</HI> And, <HI>Who can stand before that Indignation?</HI> The <HI>Curse</HI> of God haunts him; There is a <HI>Curse</HI> in all that happens unto him. There is a <HI>Curse</HI> Embittering all his Enjoyments. The <HI>Curse</HI> makes him the worse for every thing. He may have some <HI>Temporal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> but he has no Real <HI>Blessings</HI> in his <HI>Comforts.</HI> Like the Cursed Mountains of <HI>Gilboa,</HI> he has no <HI>Rain</HI> or <HI>Dew</HI> of Spiritual and Hea|venly <HI>Blessings</HI> Falling from Heaven up|on him. Nothing does him Good! <HI>Prosperity</HI> beguiles him; <HI>Adversity</HI> har|dens him. <HI>Ordinances</HI> make him no better than he was before, <HI>Oh! Mi|serble Sinner!</HI> How canst thou hear of any <HI>Miseries,</HI> and thy Heart not Faint, and even Dy away within thee?</P>
<P>Fourthly. He that is without a CHRIST, is a <HI>Slave</HI> of the <HI>Devil:</HI> But certainly, O Young People, to be such a Slave, is to be very <HI>Miserable.</HI>
<PB N="50" REF="001219_0050_0FB130FAF7956690">
Until a man get into the Hands of the <HI>Saviour,</HI> he is in the hands of the <HI>De|stroyer.</HI> We are in the <HI>Kingdom of Sa|tan,</HI> till we are translated into the <HI>Kingdom of our Saviour.</HI> [See, Col 1. 13.] Un|til a man be in CHRIST, he is not a <HI>Child of God.</HI> And he that is not a <HI>Child of God,</HI> who's is he? We may tremble to speak it; but we find it spo|ken by the mouth of God; 1 Joh. 3 10 Either the <HI>Children of God,</HI> or the <HI>Chil|dren of the Devil.</HI> Yea, but every <HI>Child</HI> of <HI>Satan,</HI> is a <HI>Slave</HI> to him. How <HI>Mi|serable</HI> is Sinner without a CHRIST? <HI>Satan</HI> has Possession of him; <HI>Satan</HI> En|slaves him; <HI>Satan</HI> Deceives him; <HI>Satan</HI> Befools him. He is Blinded by <HI>Satan; Satan</HI> hinders him from a true sight of <HI>Sin</HI> as it is, and from seeing the things of his Everlasting Peace. He is always at work for <HI>Satan;</HI> and at last <HI>Satan</HI> payes him his wages. he can't resist the motions of <HI>Satan;</HI> and <HI>Satan</HI> that has been his <HI>Tempter,</HI> at last becomes his <HI>Tormentor.</HI> He is in the <HI>Snare of Satan,</HI> and <HI>led Captive by Satan to do his will,</HI> Oh!

than any Captivity among the <HI>Monsters</HI> of <HI>Africa!</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly; Will you be sensible of it, O Young People? The <HI>Christless</HI> are under the Dominion of a worse <HI>Tyrant</HI> than the <HI>Devil</HI> himself: Sin, <HI>Sin,</HI> has Dominion over them that are without a CHRIST. It was said, Rom. 6. 14. <HI>Sin shall not have Dominion over you, for you are under Grace.</HI> But if you are not under CHRIST, you are not <HI>under Grace,</HI> and <HI>Sin will have Dominion over you,</HI> They that are without a CHRIST, say concerning Him, <HI>They will not have Him to Reign over them.</HI> God in His just Vengeance then sayes, <HI>If it be so, then let Sin Reign over them. Sin</HI> Swayes the Scepter in every Unconverted and Unsanctified Sinner. The filthy Lusts of <HI>Sin,</HI> the <HI>Desires</HI> of the <HI>Flesh,</HI> and the <HI>Desires</HI> of the <HI>Mind,</HI> are not only Raging but also Reigning in the Sinner, until he submit unto the Scepter of the Lord JESUS CHRIST. He is, Tit. 3. 3. <HI>Serving diverse Lusts.</HI> A <HI>Miserable Vassal!</HI> He has no <HI>steps ordered in the Word of

God,</HI> but, <HI>Iniquity has Dominion over him.</HI> He is alwayes toyling to Gratify his Loathsome <HI>Lusts;</HI> his <HI>Lusts</HI> precipi|tate him into Criminal and Multiplied Follies; he feels himself ruined by fol|lowing the Dictates of his <HI>Lusts,</HI> and yet he can't help it, he must follow them.

Judge, O all Young People that have come to any Exercise of Reason, Judge, whether this be not to be very <HI>Miserable?</HI></P>
<P>Sixthly: Certainly, my <HI>Young People,</HI> Tis a <HI>Miserable</HI> thing, to be in hourly Danger of Easeless and Endless <HI>Miseries.</HI> In the <HI>Damnation</HI> that waits for the sleeping Sinner in the other world, <HI>and slumbers not,</HI> there are incomprehensible <HI>Miseries;</HI> which cannot without horror be thought upon.
