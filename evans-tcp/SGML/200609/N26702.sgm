<P>AFTER having debated the matter with my&s;elf at lea&s;t twenty times, at la&s;t I determined to publi&s;h all my letters, agreeably to the reque&s;t of my friends, with &s;everal others which I have prepared, and &s;ome trifles, that may at lea&s;t amu&s;e the ig|norant, who&s;e brains, like my own, are not able to bear deep rea&s;oning, becau&s;e they have never learned Latin.</P>
<P>Having come to this conclu&s;ion, in I &s;tep|ped to my neighbour the Latini&s;t, and told him the &s;cheme, with as few round-about di|gre&s;&s;ions as I could: he heard me to the end of my tale with great patience, and then, emphat|ically &s;haking his head, exclaimed, Ah! Ro|bert, I much fear you'll find the truth of the old Latin proverb, <HI>Sutor n&egrave; ultra crepidam,</HI>&mdash;let the cobler &s;tick to his la&s;t. 'Tis a mad thing of you to commence author; for, fir&s;t, you

Secondly, you cannot come before the public with a flouri&s;h, thus&mdash;By ROBERT SLENDER, A. M. or D. M. or LL. D. or F. R. S. And in the la&s;t place, you have no great man to whom you can dedicate your per|formance: and let me tell you, that a number of the poets and hi&s;torians, of both modern and ancient times, would never have obtained the celebrity they enjoy, if they had not been pa|tronized by &s;ome great men&mdash;Odds my heart, cried I, for I could hold no longer, I thought you would have applauded my re&s;olution, and offered me your a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but in&s;tead of that, you come forward with your doubts and diffi|culties. To be &s;ure I am not rich, but what &s;ays that to my letters; the public &s;ay they like them, and why &s;hould I deny them that grati|fication?&mdash;Indeed, I grant that I cannot write myself, with truth, A.

<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR corre&s;pondents, in their ex|aminations of &s;everal mea&s;ures which have of late very much engaged the attention of the public, have, in my opinion, rea&s;oned from a very erroneous principle, namely, that prin|ces or pre&s;idents ought always to act fairly, openly and ingenuou&s;ly: that they ought not only to &s;ee that the laws &s;hould be obeyed by others, but &s;hould, in all their actions, &s;trictly act in conformity to both the letter and &s;pirit of the law them&s;elves. If this indeed were &s;o, that princes were bound by <HI>laws,</HI> and could never cau&s;e <HI>right</HI> to bend to convenience, I, for my part, would as &s;oon be a dray-man as a &s;ecretary of &s;tate; as &s;oon tug at the oar, as
<PB N="10" REF="035516_0010_1004E9369230E028">
fill the pre&s;idential chair&mdash;But I am bold to af|firm, that I can prove the contrary; fir&s;t, by the authority of the mo&s;t learned and wi&s;e an|cient &s;ages; and, &s;econdly, by the practices of princes in all ages.</P>
<P>No man, &s;ays Pliny, ever pre&s;umes to pre|&s;cribe to princes, or include them within the verge of any laws but their own inclination. In the highe&s;t po&s;t, ju&s;tice is always on the <HI>&s;tronge&s;t &s;ide.</HI> That which is mo&s;t <HI>profitable,</HI> can never be <HI>unlawful.</HI> Holine&s;s and piety, faith, truth, and <HI>common hone&s;ty,</HI> are the vir|tues of private men&mdash;princes are above the&s;e vulgar di&s;pen&s;ations.</P>
<P>It is allowed by all, that it is <HI>lawful</HI> for gov|ernors to u&s;e <HI>di&s;&s;imulation.</HI> Says one of high authority, "The same di&s;&s;imulation, which in per&s;ons of private condition would be vicious and abominable, is in princes highly commend|able: there is no di&s;charging their weighty af|fairs without it; yea, the very thing which ruins private conver&s;ation, is the be&s;t &s;upport of government. A prince or governor mu&s;t <HI>appear</HI> open, hone&s;t, &s;incere; but in his mind deceit, deep de&s;ign, and cunning must hold their &s;eat. If he wi&s;hes to govern wi&s;ely, he mu&s;t know, like Cromwell, the art of employ|ing SPIES, and the almighty power of BRIB|ERY&mdash;of compa&s;&s;ing his de&s;igns by deep de|vi&s;ed and un&s;een methods, by equivocating and
<PB N="11" REF="035516_0011_1004E93A858B53A8">
ambiguous terms; by refined &s;ubtilties and deep intrigue; by good words, fair promi&s;es, com|pliments and congratulations, formalities of EMBASSIES and letters; and by the&s;e outward|ly fair pretences and amu&s;ing &s;tratagems, bring the matters about on which his whole foul is &s;teadily fixed." And to accompli&s;h this, &s;ays Plato, "governors ought to make no &s;cruple of having frequent recour&s;e to <HI>lies</HI> and <HI>tricks;"</HI> and Pliny a&s;&s;erts, that it is a part of prudence to <HI>deceive,</HI> as occa&s;ion and the pre&s;ent po&s;ture of affairs &s;hall require. Suppo&s;e, for in&s;tance, that in any &s;tate or country whatever, there &s;hould be a citizen or &s;ubject turbulent, over|ruling and rebellious, head of a &s;trong and de|termined party, would it not be ju&s;t to em|ploy the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in &s;ecretly to &s;tab him, or bribe one of his intimates to hand him the poi&s;oned draught? Or &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome <HI>great man,</HI> who was every day increa&s;ing in popularity, and &s;trength|ening his intere&s;t; who undoubtedly had it in his power to do mi&s;chief, if he were &s;o inclin|ed; I &s;ay, would it not be prudent for the governor to clip his wings&mdash;check his popular|ity by well devi&s;ed and plau&s;ible &s;tories, <HI>forged letters,</HI> and &s;ecret corre&s;pondence, that &s;o he might not be able to annoy, if he would? To me it appears evident, that in both the&s;e ca&s;es the ruler would be perfectly ju&s;tifiable. One thing is certain, princes ever have acted thus,
<PB N="12" REF="035516_0012_1004E93D3A249908">
and in &s;o acting have ever found advocates. "In order to pre&s;erve ju&s;tice in greater and more important matters, there is &s;ometimes a nece&s;|&s;ity, &s;ays Plutarch, of deviating from it in tho&s;e of le&s;s moment; and in order to do right to the generality, it is allowable to put &s;ome hard|&s;hips and to do <HI>&s;ome wrong</HI> to <HI>particular per&s;ons."</HI> Commonly &s;peaking, &s;ays Tacitus, the <HI>noble&s;t exploits</HI> carry &s;omewhat of inju&s;tice in them. A prudent prince, &s;ays Plutarch, mu&s;t not on|ly know how to govern according to law, but know how to <HI>govern the laws themselves:</HI> that is, if the laws are <HI>not willing</HI> that he should do what is nece&s;&s;ary at that time, he mu&s;t <HI>make them willing.</HI> And, not to tire you with quo|tations from the ancients, Ari&s;totle's rule is, if a prince cannot be good in all, it is <HI>&s;ufficient</HI> that he be &s;o in the greater part of his admin|istration.</P>
<P>I now think I have fully e&s;tabli&s;hed my po|&s;ition by authorities, that princes are not bound to be, like other men, <HI>virtuous.</HI> Were I to en|ter on the proof of it from the practice of princes, it would be giving a hi&s;tory of their lives, which abounded, according to their abili|ties, in every &s;pecies of di&s;&s;imulation, deceit, and cunning; and if the mo&s;t diligent hi&s;torian can select <HI>one</HI> eminent for virtue, he will stand <HI>rara avis in terra, nigroque &s;imilima cygno</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A rare bird on the earth, very like a black &s;wan,</NOTE>.
<PB N="13" REF="035516_0013_1004E93EC15A2930">
From this di&s;qui&s;ition, of governors or princes being, in certain ca&s;es &s;upreme above all law, I would deduce the following particulars:</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. An irrefragable argument for the ju&s;tice of the Alien Bill. Tho&s;e people who are mo&s;t affected by it, and again&s;t whom it was made, are inimical to all good government. Witne&s;s the troubles they rai&s;ed in Ireland, where at <HI>pre&s;ent,</HI> and for many hundred years pa&s;t, the government hath been <HI>temperate, humane,</HI> and <HI>ju&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2d. It was nece&s;&s;ary, by the Sedition Law, to clip the wings of &s;ome men, and to &s;hew the <HI>heinous</HI> nature of &s;peaking again&s;t per&s;ons high in tru&s;t. What would have been the con&s;e|quence if a &s;top had not been put to &s;uch abu&s;e?&mdash;Colonel Lyon's impri&s;onment and fine did more good to America, by inculcating a pro|per &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to our rulers, than any thing that could be devi&s;ed, &s;hort of cutting off his head: which indeed might have been <HI>wrong</HI> in it&s;elf, but would have been right neverthele&s;s, for great advantages would have &s;prung from it.</P>
<P>I was in great &s;pirits a few days ago, ex|pecting that the tale of a tub with a double bottom, would have proved our governors well &s;killed in developing the &s;ecrets of foreign courts; but I am now quite chapfaln, for the tub appears to have lo&s;t <HI>both</HI> its <HI>bottoms.</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="035516_0014_1004E94046D6A028">
But I hope they will be more fortunate in their next attempt. I tru&s;t al&s;o that the people will &s;oon open their eyes, to &s;ee that the paltry &s;ums of money which are granted by their repre&s;ent|atives in Congre&s;s, for the u&s;e of government, will never &s;erve to an&s;wer any valuable purpo&s;e: if ever they wi&s;h to &s;ee their government re|&s;pectable, they mu&s;t give freely, and not &s;tand trifling for a few thou&s;ands, like women on a market-day higgling for halfpence; for when all is done, no &s;word can cut &s;o deep as that with a silver edge; it &s;erves with zeal, obeys without grudging, and draws the world af|ter it. Let us never judge governors by tho&s;e rules by which we our&s;elves are to abide and be governed; but re&s;t &s;atisfied under whatever laws, decrees, or ordinances the rulers frame, &s;till re|membering this grand advice, (which is my la&s;t authority) who&s;oever re&s;i&s;teth the power, re|&s;i&s;teth the ordinance of God, and they that re|&s;i&s;t &s;hall receive to them&s;elves DAMNATION.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MR. EDITOR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>UNTIL of late your paper ne|ver came into the neighbourhood where I live: we all with one con&s;ent pronounced it a <HI>French</HI> paper; and yet, when I begin to think why we did &s;o, I cannot, for my life, find a rea|&s;on; for none of us ever read a word of it. However, it came into my hands in the fol|lowing manner: A few weeks ago a man came to be my next door neighbour, who we &s;oon found took the AURORA; and, indeed when we found <HI>that,</HI> we determined to keep our&s;elves to our|&s;elves, and not to be defiled by <HI>democrats;</HI> but this re&s;olution we some how or other have entirely broken through; for he is a &s;ober, quiet, religious &s;ort of a man, and the whole family are the mo&s;t obliging you ever knew. As we grew intimate I thought it could do me no hurt to read a paragraph of his paper, ju&s;t for &s;ake of curio&s;ity, as I had no paper of my own, for I gave up the Engli&s;h paper &s;ix months ago; not that I di&s;liked his politics, but be|cau&s;e he taught the children to <HI>cur&s;e,</HI> and &s;peak <HI>bawdy.</HI> Well, to be &s;ure &s;ince that time I have every now and then, when tired of working, read a little; and it has produced on
<PB N="16" REF="035516_0016_1004E947050C7330">
me &s;trange effects: my neighbours &s;ay I am be|witched, and point their fingers at me, and call me a turn-coat; and then I wi&s;h your pa|per had never been &s;een,&mdash;but the next day the paper comes, and I cannot for the &s;oul of me keep from reading it. It makes every thing appear <HI>&s;o fair, open,</HI> and <HI>&s;o like a hi&s;tory,</HI> that I believe my neighbours may hoot on, for I am determined to read a little longer.</P>
<P>Indeed, Mr. Editor you publi&s;h &s;ome &s;trange things; I am often very much &s;urpri&s;ed: the other day, for in&s;tance, I was almo&s;t thunder|&s;truck with the account of the liberties allowed to kings and princes, in that piece &s;igned a MONARCHIST&mdash;Lord ble&s;s me, &s;aid I to my neighbour, can this be true? True, &s;ays he, aye, and this is only a very &s;mall and imperfect &s;ketch of their character. Saying this, he took down a large Chronology book (I think he called it) and read to me above fifty in&s;tances of kings and princes &s;wearing to do one thing, and do|ing immediately the contrary: of their treach|ery, malice, unforgiving temper, cruelty; of their &s;ecret murdering, covetou&s;ne&s;s, and u&s;ury; until my hair nearly &s;tood an end. But God be thanked, &s;ays I, the&s;e were all heathens, I am &s;ure Chri&s;tians could not be guilty of &s;uch crimes. My neighbour &s;miled, and &s;aid, I am &s;orry my friend to inform you, that the infamy of kings <HI>profe&s;&s;ing</HI> Chri&s;tianity, has been more
<PB N="17" REF="035516_0017_1004E949CAA08520">
notorious than that of the Heathen of Pagan monarchs: well &s;ays I, if this be &s;o, how can they ever &s;ay the Lord's prayer? Can they ever think of being Chri&s;tians, without following Chri&s;t's rule, of doing as they would be done by? Do they ever think on death? Do you &s;uppo&s;e that they can be <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> and yet &s;trive to cheat and defraud? Ki&s;s like Judas, and &s;tab like Joab; make fair promi&s;es and ba&s;e per|formances; wink at wickedne&s;s, and &s;uffer every &s;pecies of fraud to pa&s;s unpuni&s;hed; reward people for acting as &s;pics; honor the <HI>adulterer,</HI> and laugh at the crime!&mdash;Lord keep me from unbelief, &s;aid I; the&s;e men are great men, high in learning and in fame&mdash;Do they think religion a cheat, or a bug-bear only to frighten chil|dren? I believe, says my neighbour, they think nothing at all about it! The &s;cripture &s;ays, the god of this world hath blinded their eyes&mdash;and I verily believe it; but, &s;urely &s;aid I, if the rulers of this world would act &s;o, the <HI>clergy</HI> would excommunicate them, and would not &s;uffer them thus to wear the Chri&s;tian name, without its power. I cannot, &s;aid I, believe it; it cannot be. Do you know, &s;aid my neighbour any wicked men who are very rich? Yes, &s;ays I, there is X. Y. and Z. they are very rich, and every body knows they are great ra&s;cals. Well, &s;ays my neighbour, are they excommunicated? No&mdash;I prote&s;t &s;aid I, now when I think of it,

the rev. Mr. W. dined with X. on&mdash;, and with Y. on&mdash;, and &s;ix or &s;even clergymen dined with Z. a few days ago.

It is our great comfort, &s;aid my friend, that although here &s;ome things are wrong, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, among the rich and great, yet the great, the honourable and very worthy, our AMERICAN FARMERS, are VIRTUOUS, not in name but in REALITY. Vice has not been able to entice them from the &s;tandard of VIRTUE, IN|DEPENDENCE, and FREEDOM. To <HI>them</HI> we look&mdash;they are our bulwark, the guardians of our rights, the &s;upporters of our dignity, and the pillars of our CONSTITUTION.

<OPENER><SALUTE>MR. EDITOR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I THINK I have lived in the world about forty years, but I am not certain, for my parents thought dates of little con&s;e|quence&mdash;"Our &s;on, &s;aid they, will never be a <HI>great man,</HI> and what u&s;e will it be to him to be able at every opportunity to hand down the record of his birth." The prophe&s;y has been literally accompli&s;hed&mdash;I &s;tand unno|ticed among the &s;wini&s;h herd, as the poor are generally called by the great and <HI>well-born.</HI> However, be that as it may, the&s;e two or three la&s;t years pa&s;t have brought about more won|derful things, than all the re&s;t of my life; and children, and weak minded ignorant peo|ple, you know, are &s;o delighted with wonders, that oftentimes they think things are great wonders, that are no wonders at all&mdash;but I really am of opinion that the&s;e things are very wonderful which I am going to relate. The fir&s;t thing that &s;et me a wondering was, when the &s;tates rebelled against Great Britain: Lord ble&s;s me! &s;aid I, are the people mad? Is it pos|sible they can think to be able to oppo&s;e king George? Why their de&s;truction is as &s;ure as if it were written in the Bible. I trembled for
<PB N="20" REF="035516_0020_1004E9522DB29FA8">
fear, and &s;kulked into a corner, where I lay &s;nug out of &s;ight during the awful conte&s;t; and when Wa&s;hington had gained the day, and made En|gland, very much again&s;t her inclination, ac|knowledge our independence; I, wondering more than ever, &s;lipped out of my hiding-place, and talked, as well as I could, about Liberty, In|dependence, Freedom, and &s;uch like things, ju&s;t as the re&s;t of my neighbours did, who had hid as well as I. Since that to within the&s;e two or three years, as I &s;aid before, my wonders have not been very great, though pretty numerous. I wondered a good deal about the poor &s;oldiers who were &s;o nicely tricked out of their <HI>hard earned wages,</HI> by receiving two &s;hillings and &s;ixpence for twenty; and when I heard &s;o much about <HI>funding &s;y&s;tems, and banking &s;y&s;tems,</HI> and <HI>public debt</HI> being a <HI>public ble&s;&s;ing;</HI> O, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, my poor head can't under&s;tand this&mdash;I wonder what it means?</P>
<P>I wondered a good deal to &s;ee the old tories &s;lipping in by little and little into places of pow|er and tru&s;t&mdash;I then wondered at their impu|dence, and next at the readine&s;s with which they were admitted; and la&s;tly wondered what it would all come to. But the&s;e were only the beginning of wonders. I declare, Mr. Editor, one wonder of late has &s;o clo&s;ely followed ano|ther, I am yet a&s;toni&s;hed to look back on them. The revolution of France, the defeating of the
<PB N="21" REF="035516_0021_1004E954E77ADF60">
combined powers, the creating of &s;o many new Republics, the pulling down of Antichri&s;t, for which the Prote&s;tants and Pre&s;byterians have &s;o long prayed to God, and now when God <HI>has pulled him down,</HI> they &s;ay they don't thank him, which to me appears a very great religious wonder, and I believe, a very irreligious con|tradiction. I wondered at the valour and confi|dence of the king of Naples, the &s;agacity of the king of Sardinia, the con&s;i&s;tency of the Duke of Tu&s;cany, and above all, the mode&s;ty and fore|&s;ight of General Mack. At home I have won|dered at the Sedition Law&mdash;the Alien bill&mdash;the tale of a <HI>tub</HI>&mdash;the exi&s;tence of a &s;tupendous army of United Iri&s;hmen in America&mdash;the barbarous and bloody <HI>hot water</HI> in&s;urrection&mdash;the great ar|my &s;ent to &s;ubdue the <HI>vendue cryer</HI>&mdash;and, not to tire your patience with my wonders, I was &s;truck dumb with a&s;toni&s;hment when I &s;aw &s;uch a deep laid, well concerted and organized plan, to influence the people into federal ideas at the next <HI>election:</HI> not altogether under&s;tanding &s;ome part of it, I took up the paper and went in to my neighbour, who under&s;tands Latin, and is therefore you know a man of more than ordina|ry knowledge&mdash;Did you &s;ee this, &s;ays I, about the election for governor&mdash;See it &s;ays he, yes, yes!&mdash;Surely, &s;ays I, it mu&s;t all be a humbug&mdash;It has only been printed for a piece of fun; ah, &s;ays my neighbour, there is no joke like a true
<PB N="22" REF="035516_0022_1004E9566C0F05B0">
joke&mdash;It is as true as the go&s;pel. Well for my part, &s;ays I, I cannot for the life of me, &s;ee much meaning in it&mdash;&s;urely, added I, there are very few people in this &s;tate who do not know <HI>Judge M'Keau?</HI> Very true, &s;aid my neighbour, and thou&s;ands know <HI>nothing at all</HI> about <HI>James Ro&s;s.</HI> Why I was in company not may evenings ago, when it was &s;trongly debated, and &s;ome bets made about where he lived, and a world and all never heard of him before, and this they &s;aid was the rea&s;on why &s;uch pains are now ta|ken. They are fully a&s;&s;ured that without the&s;e exertions there would be no chance at all for their candidate's getting many votes&mdash;they will &s;tretch every nerve to the utmo&s;t, and you know if they &s;tand in need of a <HI>few votes,</HI> there may be found a &s;ucce&s;&s;or for <HI>Jo&s;ey Thomas,</HI> of electioneering memory, who can forge a few: be&s;ides, it makes it altogether evident what an opinion is entertained, by the&s;e gentlemen, of the independent electors of Pennsylvania; it is in fact &s;peaking to them in this language, back|country farmers and others, long experience has undoubtedly taught you, that such poor, illit|erate, uncultivated creatures as you are, can by no means pretend to <HI>judge for your&s;elves,</HI> we therefore, who now addre&s;s you, being infallibly certain that we are gifted with all possible know|ledge and extensive di&s;cernment, and likewi&s;e being the <HI>friends</HI> of <HI>order,</HI> and <HI>good government,</HI>

Here I could hold no lon|ger! Surely my friend, &s;aid I, you cannot be &s;erious; did not our Congre&s;s-men &s;ay that we were the mo&s;t enlightened people in the world&mdash;it would in my opinion, &s;aid I, be a flat con|tradiction for the&s;e men to think thus if they believed as you &s;ay.</P>
<P>By no means &s;aid my friend, do you think when they a&s;&s;erted that we were the mo&s;t en|lightened nation, that the poor farmers were included in the account; if you do, you are very much mi&s;taken, the truly enlightened are your <HI>lovers</HI> of order, your federali&s;ts, at who&s;e head &s;tands his excellency of <HI>Ninety-Six,</HI> his highne&s;s the courageous and continent <HI>Thatcher,</HI> the &s;weet &s;cented <HI>Rutledge,</HI> and the thrice noble

Soon &s;trive, &s;aid my neighbour, why they &s;trive every election, and a number are really deprived of their rights to all intents. Why they plainly tell all their labourers and trade&s;men, if they do not vote as they order them, they &s;hall not be employed by them another day!&mdash;I never was more plea&s;ed than with an an&s;wer made by a barber, with whom I am acquainted, at an election not long ago, to one of tho&s;e very wi&s;e and important gentlemen&mdash;"For whom does thee vote," &s;aid a very plain but very &s;pruce looking man; for Swanwick, &s;aid the barber.

<P>THE other evening I happened to &s;tep out to &s;ee an acquaintance, and on my way &s;topped at a neighbour's &s;tore; whil&s;t I &s;tood there, talking of, I do not remember what trifle, in came a man, &s;eemingly in high &s;pirits, and went on without any apology thus&mdash;"Well neighbour," addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the &s;tore-keep|er, "I have good news for you; you may lie down now without dread, and ri&s;e up without fear; our government is determined to demon|&s;trate to the world, that it is not to be played upon by every de&s;igning democratic ra&s;cal; God be thanked! we have learned from the
<PB N="26" REF="035516_0026_1004E96017834598">
practice of the English government, which is the best government on earth, how traitors ought to be served."&mdash;"Why, what's the matter now," said the store-keeper, "is the army to march again? Has Harper found another clue? Has Dr. Logan gone again to France&mdash;or have the con&s;pirators broken jail, or&mdash;&s;peak I pray you."&mdash;"No," an&s;wered he, "but the grant jury have found three of the in&s;urgents guilty of trea|&s;on, and they <HI>&s;hall</HI> be hanged, beheaded and quar|tered, their hearts torn out and thrown in their faces, ju&s;t the way they &s;erve con&s;pirators in En|gland. "O but" &s;ays I, venturing to thru&s;t in a word, "I believe, no body can as yet tell what will be their &s;entence; I believe &s;aid I, they mu&s;t be tried by a jury of their fellow citizens."&mdash;"Fellow fiddle&s;ticks!" replied the other, "if every cur&s;ed democrat of you could, you would free them without judge or jury;&mdash;but I tell you they <HI>&s;hall</HI> die, let the jury condemn them or not. If," continued he, "we had been wi&s;e enough in the beginning of the unnatural rebel|lion, and tru&s;&s;ed up but a dozen of the leading men in each &s;tate <HI>in time,</HI> this country would have been yet happy under the king of Great Britain; but we were &s;uch plagued fools as to give the de&s;igning fellows liberty to prate; they &s;tirred up the common people, and chiefly the the hot-headed rebellious Iri&s;h, by which means the dete&s;table &s;in of re&s;i&s;ting the Lord's anointed

Do you imagine we are to &s;it &s;till and look tamely on, till all the advances we have made to be hap|pily reconciled to our mother country are en|tirely de&s;troyed? No sir, we will <HI>re&s;i&s;t,</HI> and that in a way which &s;ome folks little dream of. I thought," continued he, "that the people were heartily tired of their folly. I was fully
<PB N="28" REF="035516_0028_1004E96598998028">
convinced in my own mind, that all they had been told by the Pre&s;ident, about republics, and republican governments, by Fenno and Peter Porcupine, about liberty or &s;uch non&s;en&s;e, had prepared them for at la&s;t putting ab&s;olute con|fidence in the men to whom they had entru&s;ted the government that they have e&s;tabli&s;hed; and not to do any thing contrary to the mind of the leading characters. But behold they &s;et up <HI>Thomas M'Kean</HI> for governor, though fully &s;atisfied that he is a democrat; &s;ure that he was, and &s;till is, an enemy to our mother country, Great Britain, and &s;ure that he, as pre&s;ident of Congre&s;s, &s;igned the in&s;trument of all our woes, the Declaration of Independence!&mdash;But Peter's right, we, who are the friends of order and good government, mu&s;t and will be found at our po&s;t&mdash;What!" &s;aid he, "I have&mdash;but mum is the word."&mdash;"Lord ble&s;s me," &s;aid I to my&s;elf, "its a hundred to one if he is not thinking about making the calico &s;hirts and blue breeches!&mdash;Indeed," &s;aid I, "friend, I know but very little about politics, but you &s;eem to know <HI>a great deal."</HI> "And &s;o I may," &s;aid he, "I learned politics when this country was a land that flowed with milk and honey. The year &s;ixty-five&mdash;ah! we'll never &s;ee &s;uch times again, unle&s;s"&mdash;"Unle&s;s what," &s;aid I&mdash;"Never mind," added he, "I'm old enough to know where to &s;top"&mdash;and &s;tamping his foot

with much force, &s;talked out of the &s;hop with great dignity; and &s;hortly after I took my leave. When I came home I &s;tepped into my neighbour's, and told him the &s;tory: Do you think, &s;aid I, that the man can have any founda|tion for venturing to talk &s;o&mdash;I declare, added I, I sometimes trembled for fear, when he talked &s;o big, about <HI>hanging</HI> and <HI>quartering,</HI> but mo&s;t of all when he &s;aid <HI>mum!</HI> But now I am quite ea&s;y, I don't believe a word of it.&mdash;In|deed, added I, as I cannot &s;ay that I am over and above courageous, except when I take a gla&s;s extraordinary; and am be&s;ides a fellow of a pale face, I dread very much fellows of Ster|retorian courage. "Indeed Robert, &s;aid my neighbour, we ought neither to pay too much regard to what we hear in this way, nor reject it altogether; there is a middle way between the&s;e extremes, which is generally the sa&s;e&s;t&mdash;that is, we ought coolly and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionately to examine both &s;ides, and reject or approve ac|cording to the dictates of rea&s;on.&mdash;Porcupine has &s;ounded the alarm, and much in the &s;ame &s;train. He is undoubtedly the organ of a &s;trong British party&mdash;they well know, that when Thomas M'Kean is cho&s;en govern|or, as without a doubt he will, it will be &s;igning another declaration of independence a|gain&s;t being under the influence of Briti&s;h mea|&s;ures, or Briti&s;h connections&mdash;they will there|fore

do all in their power to oppo&s;e his elec|tion."&mdash;</P>
<P>"Lord ble&s;s me," &s;aid I, "I'll &s;ettle my af|fairs, and retreat to my old hiding-place.

<P>WHEN your Saturday's paper came to hand, I took it up with a great deal of earne&s;tne&s;s, and ca&s;ting my eyes over it to &s;ee what I &s;hould read fir&s;t, I perceived&mdash;"To the Pre&s;ident of the United States," in large letters. So, &s;o, &s;ays I, let me &s;ee what we have got here. Amazing! three columns and an half long! Why what in the name of wonder has the man to &s;ay to his Excellency, that can take

him &s;uch a time in telling his &s;tory! However, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, 'tis no matter, my head could never, even in my younge&s;t days, know the meaning of &s;o long a tale; I'll pa&s;s it over, and leave it to tho&s;e men who are ble&s;&s;ed with a greater &s;tock of patience, and a &s;tronger brain. But ju&s;t as I was about to begin the next arti|cle, <HI>A Maryland Clergyman</HI> met my view. What, &s;ays I, was it written by a clergyman? It mu&s;t be good, it would be &s;acrilege not to read it. Perhaps, Mr. Editor, you may think &s;trange that the term Clergyman could produce on me &s;uch an effect; the rea&s;on is, my father, who loved religion, not for the <HI>name of it,</HI> but for its <HI>life</HI> and <HI>power,</HI> paid always the greate&s;t re&s;pect to the clergy. They labour for the good of our &s;ouls, he would &s;ay, and are there|fore worthy of double honour. If one of them committed a fault, in&s;tead of railing out again&s;t the whole fraternity; let us remember, he would &s;ay, a mini&s;ter is but a man; and "no <HI>man</HI> liveth and &s;inneth not." I endeavour to imitate the old man, and though I fall far &s;hort in performance, I &s;till remember the precept. There mu&s;t be &s;omething good in it, &s;aid I; perhaps its a &s;ermon, though I can't &s;ee the text&mdash;but perhaps I will meet it as I go along&mdash;&s;o having &s;nuffed the candle, opened the wick, and &s;et my&s;elf a little more on my centre, I began.</P>

the name of wonder what does this mean?&mdash;"Make a bedlam of all America;" to me it appears, &s;aid I, perfectly non&s;en&s;e. I thought when the French went to Egypt, it was a mad &s;cheme; and when before that, they changed the Sabbath into a decade, a fooli&s;h &s;cheme; but to turn America into a mad hou&s;e, was the madde&s;t of mad &s;chemes that ever a raving mad people could for a moment conceive. Was it for this, &s;aid I, they a&s;&s;i&s;ted us to obtain our independence? Was it for this that they have been ever &s;ince telling us fair tales and &s;mooth &s;tories? No, no, &s;aid I, if that's what they want, they &s;hall want; why I would not give them the &s;ize of my garden for a mad hou&s;e, let alone all America. I tried to read, it was all a joke; I could think of nothing but Bedlam&mdash;Bedlam, make a perfect Bedlam of our country, rung in my ears. I took off my &s;pectacles, put them in the ca&s;e, and muttering Bedlam all the way, went in to my neighbour? Did you ever hear the like, &s;aid I? Why what's the matter, &s;aid my neighbour? Why, &s;aid I, our Pre&s;ident tells us the&s;e <HI>plagued French folks,</HI> want to make a <HI>perfect bedlam</HI> of our country. "O," &s;aid my neighbour, "you are always in too great ha&s;te.&mdash;Did I not tell you in our la&s;t conver&s;ation, that you ought to weigh both &s;ides of every point di&s;pa&s;&s;ionately, and then judge?

what is there meant by a Bedlam, is not a mad term, as you imagined, but a receptacle for peo|ple holding opinions on religious &s;ubjects, which we and a majority of the United States think entirely without foundation, either in rea&s;on or &s;cripture." Indeed! &s;aid I, is that the meaning of a "perfect bedlam?'&mdash;"It is not," &s;aid he, "the real meaning of the term; but, however, mu&s;t be the meaning of it here.&mdash;But read on," &s;aid my friend&mdash;"you are but ju&s;t began, I &s;ee:" I read on accordingly&mdash;Is it po&s;&s;ible, &s;aid I; can this clergyman be depend|ed on?

A number of their leading men are dei&s;ts, 'tis true, and &s;o are a number of the leading men <HI>here,</HI> and in all other countries.

Why I prote&s;t, &s;aid I, this gentleman thinks that our intercour&s;e with England has tended more to our growth in wickedne&s;s and infidelity, than our love of French principles; and for my own part, added I, I mu&s;t confe&s;s I believe him.

I believe &s;aid I, they do not pay much regard to the Sabbath; but alas! they may &s;ay as much of us&mdash;And if, &s;aid my friend, that be the mark of infidelity, but a &s;mall num|ber of believers will be found in Philadelphia. And yet, &s;ays he, I have been through mo&s;t of the capital cities in Europe, and never did my eyes behold &s;uch a well regulated, quiet, inoffen&s;ive and peaceable people, as the inhabitants of Philadelphia. I &s;uppose, however, that what your par&s;on meant was in allu&s;ion to the great circulation that is given to the Age of Rea&s;on, by Thomas Paine; he thinks it was our love of French principles that enticed us to read his work; but in this, with all due re&s;pect, &s;aid my friend, I chu&s;e to judge for my&s;elf. Paine's works were, and are &s;ought for, be|cau&s;e, fir&s;t, he was a man very active, and high|ly e&s;teemed in our revolutionary conte&s;t; his Common Sen&s;e, is a jewel which cannot be too much e&s;teemed&mdash;and his Rights of Man are but a continuation of the &s;ame &s;ubject; and it is richly de&s;erving of high approbation.&mdash;<HI>Again,</HI> his Age of Rea&s;on, would never have been much known in this country if the Clergy had &s;uffered it to re&s;t; but they dragged it into

publicity&mdash;let the text be what it would, ani|madver&s;ions on Paine, made a part of the &s;er|mon. The clergy wrote&mdash;the people read. Paine was brought to the bar of the public, and in general &s;o ill was the cau&s;e of Chri&s;tianity handled, by its weak, yet conceited friends, that Paine too frequently came off with flying co|lours. I, for my own part, continued my friend, have read over &s;eriously and carefully that paper of which you have now read a part, and do in my judgment declare it to be a &s;trong evidence that the writer is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ound judgment, a clear under&s;tanding, and a good heart, and had I influence I would undoubtedly endeavour to induce every good republican to read it &s;eriou&s;ly, and weigh it impartially: it an&s;wers compleatly all the cavils that are &s;o loudly &s;ounded about our being corrupted by French principles; and his &s;trictures on the ap|pointment of men to offices of any kind what|ever, who are not in their &s;tations a terror to evil doers, and a prai&s;e to them that do well, argue that he is not a mini&s;ter for filthy lucre's &s;ake&mdash;that he holds the per&s;on of no man in e&s;timation&mdash;but is determined to reprove and not to &s;pare. But after all, &s;aid I, I can't re&s;t ea|&s;y&mdash;'tis no matter to us, added I, where the people came from, or who they are, if they make a perfect bedlam of our country&mdash;No doubt &s;ays I, but William Cobbett meant the &s;ame thing,

<OPENER><SALUTE>MR. EDITOR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN the country where I was born, &s;carce a day pa&s;&s;es in which the little country towns are not vi&s;ited by deaf and dumb prophets, who for a &s;mall &s;um make the people as well acquainted with what is to come, as they are with what is pa&s;t. When I was a child, one of the mo&s;t eminent of the&s;e divines, plainly declared that I would &s;tand in great dan|ger of being frightened to death. This pro|phecy has at different times made me very un|ea&s;y and at every appearance of danger I make it my chief concern to &s;lip out of harm's road as &s;oon as I can. However, I am very much alarmed at pre&s;ent, I dread very much that the fulfilment of the fatal prediction draweth near; and I have been &s;o often plagued and frighten|ed of late, that it will require but a little more to do my turn. Indeed if it had not been for one little circum&s;tance, it would have been all over with me long ere this time; but this gave me a little courage and kept my &s;pirits, which
<PB N="41" REF="035516_0041_1004E98D9C0CC558">
were ju&s;t ready to make a la&s;t retreat, a little longer in a &s;tate of operation. The circum&s;tance was, that all the alarms which were &s;o indus|triou&s;ly &s;pread by men of the <HI>fir&s;t rank,</HI> and all friends of order and good government, turned out to be what my neighbour the Latini&s;t &s;ays, an old fellow who&s;e name I have forgotten, &s;aid of the nightingale, <HI>Vox <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">t nihil preteria,</HI> that is, as my friend explains it, <HI>only a voice:</HI> for exam|ple, when William Cobbett publi&s;hed what he called a formidable and alarming con&s;piracy of the United Iri&s;hmen, their con&s;titution, regu|lations, and an army 50,000 &s;trong. I quaking at every limb, believed every word as firmly as if it had been revelation, barred my gates, double locked all my doors, and if a mou&s;e but &s;cratched on the wall I was ready to hide be|hind the curtains. But in a &s;hort time Cob|bett grew quiet, and all our experience from that to this has proved that <HI>it was only a voice.</HI> Next our city was to be burned&mdash;I trembled very much, and I believe &s;o did a great many more. I every night had a &s;harp eye about me, prai&s;ed the carefulne&s;s of the friends of good government, and wetting out all the fires in the hou&s;e <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> went quaking to bed&mdash;and this al&s;o proved <HI>a voice only.</HI> I was much per|plexed about the affair of X. Y. and Z.; dreamt every night of a French inva&s;ion&mdash;dreaded ter|ribly that the negroes would rebel&mdash;prayed all
<PB N="42" REF="035516_0042_1004E98F20BBFD58">
my friends to &s;trive with all their might for to increa&s;e our <HI>navy</HI>&mdash;wi&s;hed heartily for a league offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive with our mother En|gland&mdash;and thought our Envoys, the Pre&s;ident, the King of England, and the Grand Signior, the greate&s;t men upon earth. Think, only think of my di&s;appointment, when this, by the plain tale of Mr. Gerry, was &s;hewn to be like the re&s;t, <HI>for &s;ome &s;pecial purpo&s;e,</HI> only a voice. When the great Harper ingeniou&s;ly catched the clue of a mo&s;t dangerous con&s;piracy, he made the Congre&s;s-hall ring with it, and my heart throbbed violently&mdash;Lord ble&s;s me, &s;aid I, where will all this end? We have the be&s;t government on earth, <HI>except the Engli&s;h;</HI> and I dare &s;ay our great men would, <HI>to oblige us,</HI> make <HI>our's</HI> as good as <HI>their's,</HI> if we would but a&s;k them&mdash;and yet we are a divided people. Thus I mi&s;tru&s;ted my near neighbours, and was all of a cold &s;weat if I &s;aw two men talking &s;eriou&s;ly&mdash;Oh, &s;ays I, they are making up the plot&mdash;and then I ran home to put all my af|fairs to rights, that I might decamp at a mo|ment's warning. But think how I felt con|founded when I got my eyes opened, and &s;aw that the whole plan of United Iri&s;hmen, burn|ing the city, and the clue of con&s;piracy, were only to prepare the way for the Alien and Se|dition bills. The tale of the <HI>tubs</HI> al&s;o had its day, and produced on my weak mind very sen|sible
<PB N="43" REF="035516_0043_1004E990E915AB70">
effects&mdash;and my di&s;turbance of mind was beyond my feeble powers to expre&s;s, when as I was going to church on the Sabbath, a mo&s;t wicked con&s;piracy was defeated, by the vigi|lance of &s;ome active magi&s;trates: a con&s;piracy which had taken root among the <HI>taylors,</HI> who my neighbour the Latini&s;t &s;ays, being generally people (excu&s;e me for not &s;aying men) feeble, and like my&s;elf owners of <HI>pale faces,</HI> were ne|ver known to be at the head of a con&s;piracy before. But, Mr. Editor, all the&s;e frights were only as a mole-hill by the &s;ide of a moun|tain, when compared with what I the other night felt, and, alas! do yet grievou&s;ly feel.</P>
<P>The other evening, having fini&s;hed my day's work a little &s;ooner than ordinary, I &s;tepped out to drink a pint of ale at a tavern I &s;ome|times frequent to read Brown's, Fenno's, or William Cobbett's paper, and &s;moke a &s;egar. I placed my&s;elf in the dark &s;ide of the box, and after taking my draught, &s;at thinking over &s;ome of the above alarming occurrences, when in came two men, and taking their &s;eats without ever paying any attention to me, went on thus: You think the &s;ea-tyger a &s;trange bea&s;t; I wi&s;h you could but get a &s;ight of the Ari&s;tocrat. The ari&s;tocrat, &s;ays the other, you a&s;toni&s;h me. Is not your ari&s;tocrat a man? No more a man, replied the other, (with a &s;mile of &s;uperior wi&s;|dom) than the &s;ea-tyger. Odds my life, re|joined
<PB N="44" REF="035516_0044_1004E9926F376700">
his companion, what do you mean? I have heard it &s;aid a thou&s;and times that man's an ari&s;tocrat. Granted &s;aid the other, and have you not heard men &s;ay, that man is a &s;ad dog? Have you not al&s;o heard a man &s;tiled a bear, a wolf, a fox, a &s;heep, &amp;c.? I confe&s;s I have &s;aid the other. Well continued he, in the &s;ame manner a man is called an ari&s;tocrat. I li&s;tened with both my ears&mdash;the subject was &s;omething new. Well &s;aid the other, this is plagued &s;trange; was it not that I know you are al|ways poring over books, I would not believe a word of this. But pray what &s;ort of a bea&s;t is it? I am able only to de&s;cribe it by hear&s;ay, I am not <HI>entitled</HI> to a &s;ight of it&mdash;I am inform|ed, continued he, that an ari&s;tocrat is headed like a lion, its body like a leopard, its feet like a bear, its tongue like that of a man, and its teeth like that of a panther. God ble&s;s me, &s;aid his companion, it mu&s;t be a wonderful bea&s;t indeed; pray where was it produced? That, an&s;wered the other, is much di&s;puted: Clavus Beligero, who has given us an accurate account of it, &s;ays it is coeval with the devil, and ac|companied him in his fir&s;t attack upon man. But this I can &s;carcely credit, for Milton, who knew all that &s;tory as well as the devil him|&s;elf, makes no mention of it&mdash;Petrus Albinus &s;ays, "the ari&s;tocrat is the fourth bea&s;t &s;poken of by Daniel;" and Johanus Scotus, who was
<PB N="45" REF="035516_0045_1004E997946DB0C8">
well acquainted with it, &s;ays that it is the king who was &s;et over the bea&s;ts which a&s;cended out of the bottomle&s;s pit, of whom John writes in the Revelations; and for my own part I think he is right.</P>
<P>This is all new to me, I never heard a word of it, nor did I ever meet with a bea&s;t of that name in all my reading. That's not improba|ble, replied the other; yet not the le&s;s true. But are the&s;e bea&s;ts numerous? The ari&s;tocrat is like the phoenix in that re&s;pect, &s;aid the other, there is but one in the world; but that has an|&s;wered the &s;ame end as if they were innumera|ble, for it has travelled over the whole world, and wherever it &s;ets its foot, it leaves such <HI>terrible impre&s;&s;ions</HI> that they can &s;carcely ever be effa|ced, unle&s;s by the blood of millions. God for|bid, &s;aid his companion, that ever the crea|ture &s;hould defile America. Your prayer is u&s;ele&s;s, an&s;wered the other, it has, alas! been in this country too long for our quiet&mdash;Who imported it, continued he his not as yet come to my knowledge; but one thing is certain, it was brought here from England, for it is well known that Lord Dunmore was very inti|mate with it, and acted &s;olely under its direc|tion. What new wonder it this?&mdash;you &s;peak of it as if it were a rea&s;onable being. Rea&s;on|ble, replied the de&s;criber, yes, it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the art of rea&s;oning to a high degree. It was this
<PB N="46" REF="035516_0046_1004E99917522378">
circum&s;tance that led Clavus Beligero to think it was the devil's companion in the defeat of our fir&s;t parents, becau&s;e the &s;erpent is &s;aid to be more &s;ubtile than any bea&s;t of the field; and what is more wonderful &s;till, it &s;peaks di&s;tinct|ly, and under&s;tands accurately all the langua|ges and tongues that are spoken on the earth&mdash;and its di&s;cour&s;e is full of <HI>high &s;welling words of vanity.</HI> It was the ari&s;tocrat, continued he, that planned the campaign which rendered Burgoyne &s;o famous, it pre&s;ided at the Indian war fea&s;t, and 'tis &s;aid that it dictated the war &s;peech delivered to them by the general.&mdash;It was al&s;o held in high e&s;teem by General Howe, and planned the whole of that elegant exhibition, in honour of the general, &s;tiled the Mezchien&s;a. At the clo&s;e of our conte&s;t, the Engli&s;h through &s;pite let it loo&s;e, well knowing it would be a wor&s;e enemy to us, than either the Hittite or the Canaanite was to the Jews. This being found out, Dr. Franklin, Rittenhou&s;e, and a few other ingenious men, contrived a TRAP to catch it; but it is creditably atte&s;ted, that about that time the crafty creature put it&s;elf under the protec|tion of the Society of Cincinnati. Since that time the ari&s;tocrat has never appeared to any but the great and well-born, and to them he is &s;o very agreeable, that although he is of &s;uch an hideous appearance, yet ladies of the mo&s;t delicate mould play as familiarly with him as if he
<PB N="47" REF="035516_0047_1004E99AB9D09920">
were a kitten; it is al&s;o &s;aid, though I cannot credit it, that the ari&s;tocrat has been the chief coun&s;ellor, attended to by a certain per&s;on high in authority, that he is admitted into the Se|nate chamber when the doors are &s;hut, and is always pre&s;ent in the hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives when the galleries are cleared. Well, &s;aid the other, many a &s;trange &s;tory you have told me before, but this is the mo&s;t &s;ingular I ever li&s;t|ened to; why continued he, the English have done us more real harm by leaving that devil of a bea&s;t hehind them, than it was in their power to effect with all their armies. Yes, that's true, &s;aid the other&mdash;but the TRAP ap|proved of by Franklin is not lo&s;t, though it is a <HI>little</HI> out of <HI>order;</HI> and I &s;till hope the ari&s;|tocrat will be caught; and, that America may have the honor of freeing the world of this in|human mon&s;ter.</P>
<P>Having &s;aid this, they got up, paid their rec|koning and departed&mdash;I followed their example&mdash;I ran the whole way home; often however, looking on this &s;ide, and that, for fear it would leap upon me from &s;ome of its lurking places&mdash;and I might, Mr. Editor, &s;afely a&s;&s;ure you that the ari&s;tocrat meets me in my waking medita|tion, and is even pre&s;ent in my dreams&mdash;I wi&s;h that &s;ome of your ingenious corre&s;pondents would be &s;o good as to inform me through the medium of your paper, whether this bea&s;t

<OPENER><DATELINE>Bucks County, <DATE>June 14th, 1799.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>DEAR COUSIN ROBERT,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS comes with the kind love, and good wi&s;hes of my&s;elf and family to you and yours, hoping this will find you all in good health, as we are, thank God, at pre&s;ent&mdash;I was much &s;urpri&s;ed to be&s;ure cou&s;in Robert, to hear that you had of late turned your mind &s;o much to politics, and in particular, that you had ven|tured to corre&s;pond in the public prints with the editor of the Aurora, who is for certain, as all our neighbours &s;ay, a dangerous &s;ort of a man. It was by mere chance, as I do not take the Auro|ra, that I met with your publications, and now write purely to give you my advice on the occa|&s;ion&mdash;Ah! cou&s;in Robert, if you only followed the good advice of your father, my honoured uncle
<PB N="58" REF="035516_0058_1004E9BC874FF2C0">
Timothy Slender, you would certainly never have troubled your&s;elf with &s;uch kind of bu&s;i|ne&s;s, which, believe me, does not &s;uit &s;uch heads as yours&mdash;Is it po&s;&s;ible you can have forgotten how earne&s;tly he always warned all his friends and relations, and particularly your&s;elf, how that you &s;hould not upon any account have any thing to do with &s;tate affairs, but mind your own proper bu&s;ine&s;s, and get money as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible. He was, as every body knows, a very wi&s;e man, and to me it appears unaccountable that you could &s;o &s;oon forget his precepts&mdash;But how in the name of wonder, if you mu&s;t be med|dling in politics, came you to choo&s;e the editor of the Aurora, in preference to all others, to corre&s;pond with? Why he is repre&s;ented all thro' this neighbourhood as a mo&s;t &s;trange &s;ort of a man, and moreover &s;u&s;pected &s;omehow of a kind of an inclination for democracy, and writing and printing about liberty; and how that all men ought to be equal, and that the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem, which (as Mr. Fenno &s;ays) no body under&s;tands, is better than the good old kingly government, which you know our wi&s;e fathers always loved. You may well be afraid, as I &s;ee by your letters you are, of the bad con&s;equences of &s;uch con|duct. See only what it has brought your corres|pondent to. Why we have been informed, that he has been attacked on account of his publica|tions, and beaten and abu&s;ed in a mo&s;t &s;ad man|ner.

&mdash;Take warning dear cou&s;in, and think how poor a chance you would &s;tand again&s;t &s;uch fighting fellows, when the editor of the Aurora was overcome by only ten, and it is even doubt|ed if Buonaparte him&s;elf would not be over|matched by twenty &s;uch de&s;peradoes. Why there is one fellow who is &s;o powerful, that he can kill at every blow, if he plea&s;es; and then there is another, God ble&s;s us, a mo&s;t dreadful &s;ort of a man, who is &s;ure to injure every one that comes within a &s;caffold pole's length of him&mdash;be&s;ides there is M.

How|ever, being a man of &s;ome &s;en&s;e, and having &s;ome wi&s;e men about him, he was induced to obey the prophet. He did &s;o, and was cured. You have my &s;tory. I can make nothing of it, &s;aid the par&s;on. Well, &s;aid I, I'll apply it. God had his way (like the prophet) of bringing down Antichri&s;t; but you, like the great man, &s;ay his way was not a good way, and if he had taken coun&s;el with the very wi&s;e Chri&s;tians of the day, they would have taught him, that it would have been much better to have left him &s;tanding, than to have made u&s;e of &s;uch in&s;tru|ments; and now you would in&s;truct him to go|vern his providential di&s;pen&s;ations by your advice, and once more erect &s;piritual Babylon, bring back the images, catch the poor nuns, and &s;hut them once more in their cells. As I &s;aid this, his reverence leaped to his feet. I de|clare Robert, &s;aid he, you are unfit to live in &s;ociety, 'tis &s;uch men as you who are bringing the cur&s;e of God on our city.

The &s;tory ran like lightening&mdash;Robert Slender is an infidel, &s;aid one&mdash;Why, he argued with the Reverend&mdash;, and the par&s;on told him he ought to be impri&s;oned for the good of &s;o|ciety.

I re|member when I was a &s;chool-boy, one of my cla&s;s-mates was reading to old Mr. Sla&s;hem, that portion of the New Te&s;tament, where it is thus written, "there &s;hall be weeping and gna&s;hing of teeth;" but the poor boy read it thus, "there &s;hall be whipping and &s;la&s;hing to death."&mdash;You &s;ee he mi&s;called the words, but nearly pre&s;erved the &s;en&s;e&mdash;the matter was not great. One day I heard a young clergyman citing that text," the devil was a liar from the beginning"&mdash;by mi&s;taking the term he pro|nounced it thus, "the devil was a lawyer
<PB N="80" REF="035516_0080_1004EA16865F8FB0">
from the beginning"&mdash;the &s;ermon was little the wor&s;e&mdash;the <HI>&s;en&s;e was undoubtedly pre&s;erved.</HI> When &s;uch mi&s;takes as the&s;e happen, I think we ought to receive them with good nature, laugh at the blunders, and &s;o di&s;mi&s;s them. But mi&s;takes of the &s;econd cla&s;s ought not to be &s;o ea&s;ily pa&s;&s;ed over. As for example: the boy who read in &s;chool, "beggars' &s;kins," in&s;tead of "badgers' &s;kins," was, without a doubt, de|&s;ervedly whipped&mdash;for &s;hould the tran&s;criber of the command have made &s;uch a blunder, and have &s;ent it to the <HI>heads of the people;</HI> as the command of the Lord, what a plagued bu&s;tle would it have made among the beggars&mdash;and the butchers would have had a very di&s;agreeable ta&s;k. The man al&s;o was much to be blamed, who read thus, "Mr. Edward Young was <HI>executed</HI> at Cambridge"&mdash;when he ought to have read, "Mr. Edward Young was <HI>educated</HI> Cam|bridge." But all the&s;e mi&s;takes are but as mole|hills to a mountain, when compared with the mi&s;take made by Dr. Stevens, or Dr. Somebo|dy, or T. Pickering&mdash;to publi&s;h to the United States, that &s;uch ports in St. Domingo, on the fir&s;t day of Augu&s;t, &s;hould be open for to receive ve&s;&s;els from the United States; when it &s;hould have been, that it would be lawful for ve&s;&s;els to leave the United States on and after the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t&mdash;is &s;uch a blunder as I believe has not its parallel.

<OPENER><SALUTE>MR. EDITOR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LAST evening I had ju&s;t placed my tools in proper order, laid a&s;ide my apron, and was preparing my&s;elf to take a walk, to catch a mouthful of fre&s;h air, when who &s;hould &s;tep in but my old friend the Latini&s;t, with one of your papers in his hand: I have &s;everal times wondered, friend Robert, &s;ays he, that you ne|ver &s;poke to me about Mr. Sweezy the hor&s;e|thief, when you and I have been talking about your good friend Robert Li&s;ton. Odds my life, &s;ays I, I would have mentioned it&mdash;but the thing did not at all &s;urprize me&mdash;Not &s;urprize you, an&s;wered he, why, how could that be, that Sir Robert Li&s;ton would have any con|nexion with a hor&s;e-thief, <HI>a knight</HI> of Great Britain with one of the <HI>knights</HI> of the moon, as John Fal&s;taff &s;ays, is unparalleled. I declare, &s;aid I, friend, if you talk thus you'll convince me that there's le&s;s knowledge connected with a &s;kill in the Latin language than I have former|ly
<PB N="84" REF="035516_0084_1004E9F3D8C650D0">
thought&mdash;I have not read a great deal, con|tinued I; my time for reading is very little, and my poor weak head can't bear much; but in what little I have read, I never have met with a king that was not &s;urrounded by a parcel of rogues, ra&s;cals, &s;ycophants and lazy fellows, who had no con&s;cience but intere&s;t, and no god but gain! Only turn to the Bible, &s;aid I, &s;ee what a righteous &s;et &s;urrounded David, the man after God's own heart, I Sam. xxii. 26. And every one that was in di&s;tre&s;s, and eve|ry one that <HI>was in debt,</HI> and every one that was <HI>di&s;contented,</HI> gathered them&s;elves unto him. But, added I, turn to the hi&s;tory of kings, glance only at their &s;y&s;tem of bribery, of &s;pies, &s;ecret &s;ervice money, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations, open violations of every principle of justice, honour, and hone&s;ty&mdash;mark the horrid atroci|ties, which by the in&s;trumentality of the&s;e pen|&s;ioned vagabonds, they have been enabled to perpetrate; and then &s;ay, if a hor&s;e-thief does not po&s;&s;e&s;s more real honour, more humanity, more genero&s;ity, and more Chri&s;tianity than any king on earth&mdash;Mark him out for me, &s;ays I, in a rather higher tone of voice, and though I can neither &s;peak Latin, nor read Greek, nor jabber French, nor &s;ing Italian&mdash;yet I'll lay the price of all the la&s;ts in my &s;hop, that I'll prove, before an impartial audience, that a hor&s;e|thief is the mo&s;t honourable of the two&mdash;for,
<PB N="85" REF="035516_0085_1004E9E4B076B918">
continued I, what have kings done, &s;ince fir&s;t we found them in the hi&s;tory of man, but car|ried on a &s;y&s;tem of aggrandizing them&s;elves on the ruins of millions, and endeavouring con|&s;tantly to e&s;tabli&s;h their own greatne&s;s, though the poignard of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, or the &s;low work|ing poi&s;on, &s;hould drink the blood of thou&s;ands? The poor hor&s;e-thief&mdash;the Sweezies of the pre|&s;ent day, or of antiquity, are &s;o much more ho|nourable, and &s;o far the le&s;s criminal, as the value of a hor&s;e is beneath the life of a man&mdash;Of a man, did I &s;ay? of thou&s;ands of men. I'll not di&s;pute this with you, Robert, &s;aid my friend, but you know in the eyes of the world, the one is more e&s;teemed than the other&mdash;More feared an&s;wered I, ha&s;tily, I think would have been a better word; for that they are feared, is a fact&mdash;but e&s;teemed!&mdash;I am much of opinion, &s;ays I, that if e&s;teem was food, and kings could live on it, there would not be a king in the world in a week. At this my friend laughed heartily, and &s;aid, well Robert, you grow more eccentric every day&mdash;As to that, &s;ays I, I don't know what it is, only one thing I know, I hate kings mo&s;t heartily&mdash;don't mi&s;|take me, added I, I mean their office and their power, as for their per&s;ons, God be prai&s;ed, continued I, I love them and all mankind&mdash;be|cau&s;e they are all my Father's children, though like the devils, they are in an ab&s;olute &s;tate of
<PB N="86" REF="035516_0086_1004E9D83B38FAF0">
rebellion to his laws.&mdash;Well, but Robert, &s;ays he, after all, was it not a little &s;trange, that a hor&s;e-thief was employed?&mdash;I cannot &s;ee that it was, an&s;wered I&mdash;Lord ble&s;s me, have not kings their a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins? Emperors their exe|cutioners, whom they can &s;end for a head with|out judge or jury? Have not Seignors, and Sul|tans, and Moguls, their mutes? And have not bawdy-hou&s;e keepers their&mdash;<HI>bullies?</HI> And would you think it &s;trange, that an amba&s;&s;ador, a &s;er|vant of a king, might not even employ a hor&s;e|thief, and not in his <HI>proper vocation</HI> either, but only as a letter-carrier?&mdash;I confe&s;s I &s;ee no|thing &s;trange in it; but I have but a poor brain&mdash;there may be much in it that I can't &s;ee. Why &s;aid my friend, I have as little depen|dence on the friend&s;hip of kings as your&s;elf, and therefore I cannot help thinking there was more in the choice of this per&s;on, than has yet, or perhaps ever may come to light. It was a thou&s;and pities that the fellow got away; on a clo&s;e examination things might have come to light, which would have been highly ad|vantageous. From the affair of Mr. Blount, and the repeated a&s;&s;urances we have received, through very different channels, of a &s;trong party in the United States, favourable to the intere&s;t and political views of Britain; Li&s;ton's letters, which are in the hands of the public; and the di&s;agreement between the commi&s;&s;ion|ers

for the &s;ettlement of <HI>Briti&s;h claims,</HI> I am induced &s;trongly to believe, that the Briti&s;h have not yet relinqui&s;hed the idea of once more cau&s;ing the United States to bend be|neath their power. Attend to the language of her hirelings here; do they not vilify our con|&s;titution, mock at our laws, abu&s;e our indepen|dence, traduce and calumniate our magi&s;trates, and talk of our freedom as if it were &s;lavery? Do they not &s;peak of the Engli&s;h government as a paragon of perfection? Smooth over their crimes, and convert them into virtues? Inform our citizens, that the Engli&s;h are the happie&s;t, the free&s;t, the mo&s;t virtuous and mo&s;t humane people on earth? Have they not even endea|voured to increa&s;e our <HI>&s;y&s;tem of expence?</HI> that &s;o our citizens might be galled with taxes, and &s;o forced to look back to the mild era of '63, when they were happy under the fo&s;tering wing of Great Britain. Now, continued my friend, keeping <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">t in view, who more fit than the hor&s;e-thief, to fill an important of|fice? From his former vocation, you know, he was nece&s;&s;arily well acquainted, with not only the intricate paths and bye-ways through the country, but al&s;o the different per&s;ons who were con&s;picuous in the late conte&s;t&mdash;remem|ber, he was not to go <HI>&s;traight forward;</HI> but by a circuitous route, and of this Sir Robert was al&s;o acquainted. It is highly probable that
<PB N="88" REF="035516_0088_1004E9CAA9B7C388">
he was to &s;ound &s;everal influential characters, either directly, or indirectly, that &s;o &s;ecret &s;ervice money might not be applied in vain: that they might know their &s;trength, and if opportunity offered, be able to take time by the forelock&mdash;For it is ab&s;olutely certain, that if the coalition of kings, emperors, &s;eignors, and moguls, can prevail &s;o as to e&s;tabli&s;h a mo|narchy in France, which God in his infinite mercy forbid, our republic mu&s;t undoubtedly fall: we mu&s;t receive a king, one of the royal brood of Great Britain, and like &s;paniels lick the feet of godlike maje&s;ty&mdash;God help us, &s;aid I, I feel very much afraid indeed; I think I &s;ee the red coats once more march along the Delaware&mdash;I think I hear the groans of free|born Americans from the hulk of the Jer&s;y pri|&s;on &s;hip&mdash;my blood runs cold&mdash;I think I behold the Crooked Billet &s;cene acted over again, and the poor fellows frying in the buckwheat &s;traw&mdash;Lord deliver us, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">t I, knitting my hands in agony; I &s;ee&mdash;I &s;ee Burgoyne's Indian cantico&mdash;I &s;ee the &s;avages knawing human bones&mdash;I hear their helli&s;h yells, and behold more amiable Mi&s;s Crea's victims to their hor|rid cruelty&mdash;Where? where? added I, &s;hall we hide!

<OPENER><SALUTE>MR. EDITOR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>EVER &s;ince I have known how to write my own name, I have been wonder|fully fond of new inventions&mdash;to plod on the old beaten track, I ever thought an evidence of a low grovelling &s;pirit, a &s;neaking dependence, and an unfruitful genius&mdash;'tis true, many a piece of good leather I have &s;poiled through this itch of invention, and never found much profit

from all my experiments; but I ever comfort|ed my&s;elf with this &s;entence, Well, well, if it is not good for me, it may be good for po&s;terity&mdash;and &s;o I have always gone on with much plea|&s;ure, and <HI>little profit,</HI> to this pre&s;ent day. By this peculiar turn of mind I am induced to keep a memorandum book, and whenever I hear of any new invention&mdash;&s;lap&mdash;da&s;h, I pop it down in my book, for the good of po&s;terity. It will be here, &s;ays I to my&s;elf, when I am gone, as I replace my book on the &s;helf&mdash;Judge then Mr. Editor, with what keenne&s;s I took down my book, when I heard of the baking of the poor &s;oldier in Bri&s;tol a few weeks ago&mdash;&s;ays I, I have heard in England and Ireland, of gagging for im|pertinence, impri&s;onment, and &s;ometimes flog|ging for drunkenne&s;s, ducking for slovenline&s;s, &s;hooting for de&s;ertion, and hanging for being an United Iri&s;hman; but BAKING, added I, is, as the Scotchman &s;ays, <HI>vary</HI> new&mdash;and &s;hews the inventor to be an original genius, and not a &s;er|vile copier&mdash;But whatever prai&s;e, Mr. Editor, may be ju&s;tly due to the inventor of this <HI>&s;aluta|ry</HI> and <HI>humane</HI> mode of military puni&s;hment, which undoubtedly will confer a la&s;ting honour on the mildne&s;s of the United States' martial laws&mdash;yet I tru&s;t this great genius will not be offended with a few improvements, which, with all deference to his &s;uperior abilities, I hum|bly offer for the improvement of that elegant
<PB N="91" REF="035516_0091_1004E9C5F4EFBA30">
and original mode of puni&s;hment. One capital defect that I would fir&s;t mention is, that, if I am well informed, the inventor's oven was quite cold; now you know that in all puni&s;h|ments, if fear be taken away, the puni&s;hment lo&s;es much of its effect, and in an oven with|out heat there is not much fear&mdash;there is far more fear in a dungeon, for there a man might be eaten alive by rats. 'Tis true, the air might not be very whole&s;ome, and might oc|ca&s;ion &s;ome &s;light convul&s;ion fits, but what does that signify? that leaves no marks; and with|out marks, you know, there well be but a &s;light remembrance. I would al&s;o remark, that in this puni&s;hment there is no degrees&mdash;You may an&s;wer, yes&mdash;degrees of duration; but I mean degrees of external pain: for in&s;tance, Put your man when dead drunk into your oven, he either &s;leeps out his time and then awakens, or &s;leeps the time appointed and never awakens. In the fir&s;t ca&s;e, &s;uppo&s;e he awakens at all, what puni&s;hment has he felt? In the &s;econd, &s;uppo&s;e he never awakens, fools and democrats will rail again&s;t the mode of puni&s;hment&mdash;Now to remedy the&s;e defects, and make the inven|tion as <HI>u&s;eful,</HI> as it is elegant <HI>and manly,</HI> the following hints are offered. Fir&s;t, let the oven be carefully heated, and the heat regulated by the be&s;t thermometer: when it &s;tands at 90 it

<OPENER><SALUTE>MR. EDITOR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE you became the editor, I have, till very lately, been highly plea&s;ed with you. I con&s;idered you as a man of a determined &s;pirit, having one great end in view, and &s;tea|dily pur&s;uing it. I read your paper with both plea&s;ure and profit, and thereby was led to form a pretty accurate judgment of men and man|ners, as I thought; but I believe, &s;ir, you have at la&s;t gone mad wrong&mdash;Your remarks about the &s;hip King&s;ton, are, I think, very un&s;ustifi|able; and I &s;hall now undertake to prove, that whoever they were that loaded the &s;hip&mdash;who|ever they were who &s;uffered her to clear out,
<PB N="102" REF="035516_0102_1004EA350C958308">
or whoever he was who gave an order for her clearance, all of them acted as hone&s;t men ought.</P>
<P>In our dealings with each other, it is a well|known and long-e&s;tabli&s;hed principle, that, that which advantageth me, and does no harm to any one el&s;e, is certainly lawful for me to do.&mdash;In the &s;hip King&s;ton, Dr. Stevens was to &s;ail to St. Domingo&mdash;Does not every body know, that when you add to Dr. Stevens's weight&mdash;<HI>his dignity&mdash;his office&mdash;his ambition&mdash;and his well-known and well-tried diplomatic &s;kill</HI>&mdash;and join thereto the weight of all his attend|ing retinue&mdash;that &s;till the &s;hip <HI>would not</HI> have half her burden? Now this being granted&mdash;and I cannot &s;ee how it can be denied&mdash;unle&s;s it can be demon&s;trated, that an Amba&s;&s;ador is a &s;ufficient burden for a &s;hip of as large a burden as the King&s;ton&mdash;I proceed to prove, that carrying a few articles more, if it could be of advantage to any per&s;on, and di&s;advantage to no per&s;on&mdash;could not be a crime&mdash;my fir&s;t is granted&mdash;and my &s;econd a moral axiom&mdash;therefore no blame can be placed to the account of Mr.&mdash;, who freighted, Mr.&mdash;who cleared it out of the Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e, or Mr.&mdash;who gave the order to the Cu&s;tom Hou&s;e offi|cer, as their authority&mdash;for their part of the bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;and yet you have made the whole continent ring about it&mdash;Ah, Mr. Editor, I am &s;orry for thee, that thou did&s;t publi&s;h &s;o unad|vi&s;edly

that inventory&mdash;And &s;o I told my friend the Latini&s;t&mdash;he has no right to &s;ay a word about that bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;ays I, he can make nothing of it&mdash;odds my life, added I, what a fooli&s;h thing it would have been to have &s;ent the &s;hip King&s;ton &s;o far, for &s;uch a trifle, as could in rea&s;on be paid for the pa&s;&s;age of <HI>one man</HI> and his attendant. Why an&s;wered he, Robert, you &s;eem to have entirely mi&s;taken the matter. It may be &s;o, &s;aid I, mi&s;takes are very com|mon in our days among men of the <HI>fir&s;t abilities,</HI> and how then &s;hould I e&s;cape&mdash;but tell me, added I, in what?&mdash;Why Robert, &s;aid he, the &s;hip King&s;ton was hired wholly and &s;olely, for to carry Dr. Stevens and his &s;uite, as they term it. Is it po&s;&s;ible you can be &s;erious? &s;aid I. I am in reality&mdash;it is an e&s;tabli&s;hed cu&s;tom. And as fooli&s;h a one, &s;aid I, as ever I heard of&mdash;a whole &s;hip for one man&mdash;It puts me in mind of a laughable affair that happened about forty years ago in England&mdash;A Liverpool privateer took a very rich Spani&s;h prize; the lea&s;t boy in the privateer had &s;ome thou&s;ands for his &s;hare. The &s;ailors came into port&mdash;dre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves as fine as po&s;&s;ible&mdash;and every way was taken they could devi&s;e, to &s;pend their money: they would join in cabals, engage all the coaches they could find; each man would have five or six, one to carry his hat, another his cane, a third his knife, a fourth his tobac|co-box&mdash;and
<PB N="104" REF="035516_0104_1004EA3A821D07E8">
in this &s;tate would they ride ten or fifteen miles <HI>to buy a pound of tobacco.</HI> But the fact was, they &s;oon got through their mo|ney&mdash;but, &s;ays I, this makes it &s;till le&s;s of a fault&mdash;if they had the Dr's. con&s;ent, and gave him enough of elbow room&mdash;But &s;till, &s;ays my friend, you &s;eem to forget that Congre&s;s made a law to prevent us from buy|ing or &s;elling any thing, or having any in|tercour&s;e with France, or her dependencies, until they would alter their treatment of our ve&s;&s;els and come on honourable terms of adju&s;t|ment&mdash;No, no, &s;ays I, I have not forgotten that&mdash;Why, then you know, it was a breach of the law in the mo&s;t expre&s;s manner po&s;&s;ible&mdash;By no means, &s;aid I&mdash;I remember to have read in the Te&s;tament, the&s;e words&mdash;<Q>For the LAW was not made for the righteous, but for &s;inners, and the rebellious</Q>&mdash;&s;o &s;ay I of this law, and &s;o I expound it&mdash;The friends of good order and good government are not <HI>bound,</HI> nor is it fit they &s;hould be <HI>bound,</HI> by the&s;e or|ders and regulations that others are <HI>bound</HI> by. They are the righteous: Democrats are the &s;inners and rebellious. Mark that&mdash;they &s;peak again&s;t authority and revile kings, which you know are God's ordinance&mdash;the law was made to bind them&mdash;now, &s;aid I, if you can prove that a &s;ingle pair of democratical breeches were aboard the King&s;ton, then I'll grant it
<PB N="105" REF="035516_0105_1004EA3C05ED6908">
that the law was broken in reality.&mdash;Why, Robert, &s;aid my friend, many a queer thought comes into your head, but this is the mo&s;t &s;in|gular&mdash;And yet, replied I, I'm &s;ure it is true; &s;uppo&s;e, &s;aid I, Schneider the printer had gotten a number of men and flogged Captain Montgo|mery, would the fault have been as trivial as Montgomery's flogging the printer?&mdash;Or, had Mr. Duane, and ten or twenty of his friends, went and kicked, cuffed and rib-roa&s;ted any of the <HI>valiant</HI> officers who maltreated him, would the fault be only equal to theirs? Or, to men|tion only one more, if the man, whom the va|lorous Sterrit killed, with &s;o much courage, had killed Sterrit, do you believe, he would have been alive at this day? Its highly probable, &s;aid my friend, that he would not. Again, &s;aid I, I &s;uppo&s;e you have read the paper of the 24th ult. upon account of which the editor was ar|re&s;ted, was it in any re&s;pect to be compared with Cobbett's in&s;olent and virulent remarks on the nomination of R. V. Murray&mdash;and yet you &s;ee he was not arre&s;ted&mdash;And only here lies the difference between them: the one is a citizen of the United States who owes fidelity to the union; the other glories in being a &s;ubject of the king of England, our former tyrant:&mdash;the fir&s;t mantains that all governments originate in the people, and that they make rulers, who are re&s;pon&s;ible to them for their conduct&mdash;the

When the li|berty of nations, and the freedom of &s;tates, are depending on almo&s;t the turn of a beam&mdash;when corruption lifts its head in open day un|a&s;hamed&mdash;when bribery is reduced to a regular and avowed &s;y&s;tem&mdash;when religion has degen|erated into hypocri&s;y, and men with brazen front a&s;&s;ert that they love God, and yet plot to de&s;troy their brother, covering the earth with blood, rapine, and horrid cruelty&mdash;when &s;uch is the &s;tate of things, &s;aid my friend, the de&s;truction of an ob&s;cure individual, however di&s;honourable and perfidious the &s;acrifice, will be ea&s;ily looked over, and perhaps forgotten&mdash;for who would attend to the burning of a ta|per, when Etna or Ve&s;uvius blazes?</P>

mark the intrigues of kings and emperors, popes and muftis, princes and bi&s;hops, nobles and prie&s;ts, with the whole train of their depen|dants and adherents, united as one man&mdash;and a|bove all, &s;ee republics betrayed into the con|&s;piracy again&s;t them&s;elves&mdash;It is vain, friend Robert, to repine over the fate of poor Rob|bins; we may 'tis true deplore the man&mdash;but we mu&s;t con&s;ider what is to become of the re|public under &s;uch a precedent of di&s;honour and indignity!&mdash;Liberty or its enemies mu&s;t tri|umph&mdash;one or the other mu&s;t fall; and, how|ever gloomy you may be, con&s;idering the &s;tate of this martyr to Briti&s;h tyranny and influence, his death may be the &s;alvation of our liberties.

Why, &s;aid I, you know when Judge Bee pa&s;&s;ed &s;entence on poor Robbins, he argued, that his being a citizen of the United States was of no con&s;equence&mdash;and now we &s;ee the greate&s;t pains are taken to prove that he was not a citizen&mdash;The wi&s;e men in Danbury &s;ay they knew him not, and the old &s;exton was not pre&s;ent at his bapti&s;m&mdash;If it had been of any importance in any way, the wi&s;e and upright judge, would have undoubtedly known it&mdash;and &s;ince it was not, why &s;earch for it now?

It appears to me pretty evident, that it was &s;uppo&s;ed, the yielding up an ob&s;cure individual, without fortune and without friends, would never have been noticed by the public; but when the mi&s;take was found out&mdash;when it was di&s;covered the America, from Georgia to New Hamp&s;hire, rang with it, then this &s;tory, whe|ther true or fal&s;e I know not, was pre&s;ented to the public?&mdash;Odds my heart, &s;aid I, what's the meaning of this? can it be imagined for a mo|ment, that the people are to be gulled at this rate?&mdash;are we bound to &s;wallow all the &s;tories that de&s;igning men can invent? No, added I, the days of prie&s;t-craft and king-craft are at an end. God be prai&s;ed, we can, and we will think for our&s;elves.
