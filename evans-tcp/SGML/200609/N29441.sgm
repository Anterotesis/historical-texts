<HEAD>By the GENERAL COURT Held at Boston, October the tenth, 1677.</HEAD>
<P>WHereas the Lords wayes towards his people are often mixt with Mercies and Judgements, and are so towards our selves at present; the Holy and wise God keeping us under his Rod in divers respects; justly chastising us for our many and great provocations of the eyes of his glory; for which we have great reason to ly in the Dust, and to implore his Compassions: And yet on the other side we have cause to acknowledge that this year past his mercies have been manifold, giving us Peace in a great measure, with a rich Blessing on the Fruits of the Earth, and hitherto mercifully prevent|ing so great a spreading of Infectious Diseases that have been amongst us, as was rationally feared by many: As also frustrating the hopes of our Malicious Ad|versaries, and graciously considering us in the midst of our fears, giving us fa|vour in the eyes of our Soveraign Lord the King, and his most honourable Coun|cil; as Letters received from our Agents do fully inform us: besides many other benefits that the Lord is pleased to be loading us daily with, whereby we are greatly obliged to offer the sacrifice of praise, and bless his Holy Name:</P>
<P><HI>This Court do Order, Appoint, and Set apart, the fifteenth of November next, to be kept a day of Thanksgiving unto God, throughout this Jurisdiction: Prohibiting all Servile Labours upon that day, and enjoyning all the Churches, Ministers and People within this Colony, solemnly, and seriously to keep the same accordingly.</HI></P>
