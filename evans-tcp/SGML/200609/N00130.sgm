<P><HI>THat Men ought to be of a publick Spirit is a Truth granted by all; for even the light of Nature doth evince it.

<Q><HI>For David, after be had served his own Ge|neration by the Will of God fell on sleep, &amp; was laid unto his Fathers, &amp; saw Corruption.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN these Words (which are the words of <HI>Paul</HI>) we are pre|sented with these five things.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Life of <HI>David,</HI> a man <HI>after Gods own heart,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it|ted thereby to be a pattern and Example to the Servants of God in <HI>after Ages</HI> and <HI>Generations.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The Death of <HI>David,</HI> under a comfortable Shadow and Similitude, <HI>he fell asleep.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The Burial of <HI>David, he was laid to his Fathers</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The Effect of his Death and Burial, <HI>he saw Corruption.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. A convincing Argument hence to prove that those words in <HI>Psal.</HI> 10. 10. were spoken of Christ and properly to be applyed unto him and not to <HI>David;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">or <HI>David <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Corruption,</HI> but <HI>Christ saw no Corruption</HI> here, <HI>ver.</HI> 37. Therefore that <HI>Holy One</HI> to, or concerning whom that promise, <HI>ver.</HI> 35. was made, was Christ.</P>
<P>In the first of these, (which may be the Subject of the present dis|course) we have, (1) a <HI>Metaphori<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">al Expression</HI> of <HI>Davids Life,</HI> un|der the Term of <HI>Service,</HI> David though a King yet he was a Servant, which requires Diligence and Faithfulness, and is attended with many Exercises of Patience. (2) The Subject of his Service, <HI>his own Genera|tion,</HI> those that were his <HI>Contemporaries,</HI> that lived in the same <HI>Age</HI> and <HI>Generation</HI> with himself. (3) The Rule whereby he served his Genera|tion, <HI>by the will of God,</HI> not by his own will, not by the will of <HI>his Genera|tion,</HI> not by his own will although he was a King, not by the will of <HI>his Generation</HI> although he was a <HI>Servant,</HI> he was not such a King as to serve them by his own will, not such a <HI>Servant</HI> as to Serve them by their will.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="000185_0005_0FA31751C7F8C968">
<HI>David</HI> in this serving <HI>his Generation</HI> may be considered and lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t upon, (1) As a private Christian, as a godly man. (2) As a man in publick place, (1) As a Prophet, for so he was a man endowed with abundance of the Spirit, whereby he was an Instrument of publishing the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> God for the good of his Church, not only in that Age but in <HI>after Ages</HI> of the World (2) As a King, the <HI>Political head</HI> of <HI>Israel,</HI> now under all these Relations <HI>David</HI> served <HI>his Generation,</HI> and served them <HI>by the will of God.</HI></P>
<P>Doct. The life of a Christian, especially of such as are in publick place ought to be a Serving of their Generation, and to be ruled therein by the will of God: Every Christian as he hath a God to Serve, so he hath a Ge|neration to Serve, in serving of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> be Serves God, every Christian should so live as that his Generation may be the better for him.</P>
<P>In the Doctrinal prosecution of this point, I shall show, (1) Where|in this service of our Generation doth consist? (2) Why a Christians life must be spent in the service of <HI>his Generation?</HI> and (3) Why <HI>by the will of God?</HI></P>
<P>Quest. 1. <HI>What is it for a Christian to serve his Generation according to the will of God?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> There is comprehended and implyed in it, 1. <HI>That Christians should be men of publick Spirits,</HI> it is requisite that every Christian should be so, especially publick persons, they must not be of private Spirits, not cearer in any private Interest, a private Spirit is an un-Christ-like un-Christian Spirit, to look only on our own things, to be of a private Spi|rit is more <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> like,</HI> Gen 4 9. then Christ-like, <HI>Phil</HI> 2. 4, 5. <HI>Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ,</HI> that we be not such as <HI>Paul</HI> complains of <HI>ver.</HI> 21. <HI>that seek our own things,</HI> David had this publick Spirit, <HI>Psal.</HI> 122. 9. <HI>I will seek thy good,</HI> this also was <HI>Nehemiahs</HI> frame, <HI>Chap.</HI> 2 10. <HI>he sought the welfare of Israel,</HI> and <HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> Esther 10. 3. <HI>he sought the wealth of his people, and spoke peace to all his Seed.</HI></P>

<P N="4">4. <HI>A solemn and serious pondering and weighing the state of our Genera|tion,</HI> Christians must study their Generation, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10. 24. <HI>Let us consi|der one another.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Study the evils of our Generation;</HI> there is a two fold evil that every Generation of Professours is ordinarily tainted with, (1) <HI>Practical,</HI> as every Generation of fallen mankinde is under the prevailing power of sin, so there are some sins that are the special prevailing sins of such a Ge|neration; <HI>Israel</HI> in the wilderness had special sins incident to that Gene|ration, unbelief; tempting of God, murmuring against him and his Ser|vants, were the provoking sins of that Generation, wherewith they grieved God forty years, <HI>Psal</HI> 95. 10. in <HI>Can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">an</HI> there were other sins, when they had plenty and abundance of all outward Comforts and bles|sings then they were lifted up, and kicked against God and forgate him, <HI>Deut.</HI> 32. 15&punc;18.

(2.) <HI>Doctrinal</HI> evils, the errours of our Generation, <HI>Doctrinal</HI> evils as well as <HI>Practical</HI> have been from Generation to Generation in the Church of Christ, and among a professing People, <HI>Rev.</HI> 2. 14,15. in the Church of <HI>Pergamus</HI> were the <HI>Nicolaitan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> and in the Church of <HI>Co|rinth</HI> some denyed the Resurrection, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15. there must be an oppo|sing and withstanding of these evils, <HI>Contend for the Faith,</HI> Jude 3.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Study what is the work of our Generation;</HI> Every Generation hath a common work and something proper, some special Service to do for God; <HI>Moses</HI> was to bring <HI>Israel</HI> out of <HI>egypt, joshua</HI> to possess them of the promised Land, some are to lay the Foundation for God and others to build thereupon; <HI>Davids</HI> work was to settle the <HI>Ark</HI> in <HI>Zion</HI> under Curtains, and <HI>Solomons</HI> to build a Temple for it.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>The faithful Improvement of all the Talents God hath be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rusted us with for the go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d of our generation,</HI> so did <HI>David;</HI> some have one Ta|lent, some two, some five, and they are all to be laid out for the good of our Generation.

<P>Quest. 2. <HI>Why must a Christians Life be the Service of his generation?</HI></P>
<P>Reas. 1. <HI>Because such a Life is a Christ-like Life,</HI> Christ Jesus came into the world to save and to serve the world, we shall herein write after the highest and purest Copy, <HI>Math.</HI> 20. 28. no Servant of his Generation like him, no Service like his, none ever served themselves less then Christ did, nor their Generation more, he spent his Life and laid down his Life, (though not for that Generation only, yet) in the Service of his Genera|tion, Christs Life was Exemplary unto us.</P>

Publick persons are under a <HI>special Obligation</HI> and <HI>Bond</HI> of Service, the Latine word, <HI>officium,</HI> signifies both office and duty, and they have more Service from their Generation then others, and therefore owe more Service to their Generation, <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">cle.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. 9.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>We are all served by our generation,</HI> the great God of Heaven and Earth hath in his Infinite wisdome so disposed of things in the world, that as the whole <HI>Universe</HI> hath a dependence upon him, so also some depen|d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nce one upon another, as we cannot live without God, so neither with out one another.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Our generation is our Masters Family,</HI> God is the Father and Master of the <HI>great Family</HI> in Heaven and Earth, and in the faithful ser|ving our Generation we serve the God of our Generation, as the Ste|ward of a <HI>great man</HI> in serving his <HI>Masters Family</HI> according to his will, serves his Master.</P>

Psal. 122. 8. <HI>For my Brethren and Companions sake, I will say, Peace be within thee.</HI></P>
<P>Reas. 3. <HI>Our own good is wrapped up in the good of our Generation:</HI> the better it fares with our Generation, the better will it fare with us, if our Generation be happy, prosperous, holy, &amp;c. it will be well with us, so with <HI>Israel</HI> in <HI>Babilon,</HI> they must seek <HI>Bab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> peace and prosperity, for therein they sought their own, <HI>Jer.</HI> 29 7.</P>
<P>Qu. 3. <HI>Why must Christians in serving their Generation be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uled by the will of God, and not by the will of their generation, nor by their own will?</HI></P>
<P>In Answer hereunto, I shall first speak something to the Negative in those two things mentioned.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The will of our Generation must not be the Rule of our Service.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 1. Because sometimes our Generation is exceeding vile, very corrupt and sinful, it is th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> portion of Saints to live in an evil Generation, <HI>Deut.</HI> 32, 5. <HI>a perverse and crooked Generation.</HI> ver. 20. <HI>a froward and faithless Generation,</HI> Judg. 2. 10. <HI>a Generation which know not the Lord,</HI> Psal. 78. 8. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a stubborn and rebellious Generation that set not their Hears aright,</HI> Psal 95. 10. <HI>A Generation that erre in their Hearts,</HI> Mat. 3. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. <HI>a Generation of Vipers,</HI> Mark 8. 38. <HI>an Adulterous and Sinful Genera|tion,</HI> Act. 2. 40 <HI>an untoward Generation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 2. The best Generation is ordinarily a divided Generation, a mixed Generation, like those in the confused Assembly at <HI>Ephesus,</HI> Act. 19. 32. some cry one thing and some another, some are for God, and some are for <HI>Baal,</HI> whence it is impossible to serve our Generation ac|cording to their will, it is more possible to please God then to please our Generation.</P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 3. Because our Generation is changeable, they may cry <HI>Ho|sanna</HI> to day, and crucifie Christ soon after, as they change often in their Fashions, so In Religion; luk. 4 22. they admire his gracious words, <HI>ver.</HI> 28, 29. they are fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">led with wrath and would kill him presently, <HI>Jer.</HI> 2. 36. <HI>why gadaest thou about so much to change th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> ways</HI> ver. 11, <HI>My People have changed their glory, &amp;c.</HI> Isai. 24. 5. <HI>they have changed the Ordinance, &amp;c.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Object.</HI> But some may say, this was in the <HI>old Testament,</HI> what have you in the <HI>New-Testament</HI> either as to <HI>Precept</HI> or <HI>President</HI> for it? To this I Answer,</P>
<P N="1">1. As for a <HI>Precept,</HI> Consider two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. What have you against it, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o <HI>Countermand</HI> it in the <HI>New-Testa|ment?</HI> who durst have abolished the <HI>Ceremonial Law</HI> that was of force in the <HI>Old-Testament,</HI> if the <HI>New-Testament</HI> had not done it?</P>
<P N="2">2. What <HI>Precept</HI> have you in the <HI>New Testament</HI> for the Magistrate to meddle in matters civil, to punish <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s, Ly<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rs, Unclean persons, Murderers?</HI> must you not go to the <HI>Old Testament</HI> for it? then why not also for their dealing in the matters of Religion? but if you look into <HI>Rom</HI> 13 3, 4. you will find the civil Magistrate is to be a <HI>Terrour to evil doers,</HI> if those that violate <HI>the first Table</HI> be evil doers, then the Magistrate is to punish them for it.</P>
<P N="2">2. As for <HI>Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">dent,</HI> Consider also two things,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Times wherein the <HI>New-Testament</HI> was written were the Times prophesied of, wherein <HI>the Heathen should rage, and the Kings and Rulers of the Earth set themselves against the Lord, and against his Anointed,</HI> Psal. 2 1,2,3. with <HI>Act.</HI> 4. 25, 26, 27. but they had better council given them in the Conclusion of the same <HI>Psalm,</HI> ver. 10, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<HI>Jehoshaphat, a Nehemiah</HI> in those <HI>New-Testament</HI> times, and I shall find that they did as much for God as they in the <HI>Old,</HI> and I doubt not but had <HI>Nero</HI> and <HI>Gallio,</HI> and others of that Temper lived in the <HI>Old Testament</HI> times, they would have done as little for God, and as much against him, as when they lived in these latter Times.</P>
<P>By way of Direction,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Kiss the Son,</HI> kiss him heartily in respect of the disposition of your own Souls, kiss his mouth, his hand, his foot, Kiss him with a kiss of <HI>di|lection,</HI> Kiss him with a Kiss of <HI>Subjection</HI> to all his Ordinances, Kiss him with a kiss of <HI>Adoration,</HI> Psal. 2. 10, 11, 12. it will be your wisdom and honour so to do.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let the Churches of the Lord Jesus find <HI>protection</HI> and <HI>patronage</HI> under the shadow of your wings, for the sake of the Church the world stands; <HI>the Princes of</HI> Israel <HI>pitched their Standard at the Command of God, about the Tabernacle of the Congregation to secure it,</HI> Numb. 2. 2. Churches do now grow low, you have been brought forth and brought up in the Churches of Christ, take your Mother by the hand, that it may not be said as <HI>Isai.</HI> 51. 18. <HI>not any taketh her by the hand of all the Sons she hath brought up,</HI> Remember what is spoken of Kings, <HI>Isai.</HI> 49. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P N="3"> 3. <HI>Speak comfortably to those that teach the good knowledge of the Lord,</HI> as <HI>Hezekiah</HI> did, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 30. 22. let us have your favourable and gra|cious aspect (and let nothing be done by any of us to render us unworthy of it) a good Correspondence between Magistracy and Ministry con|duces much to! the good of our Generation; <HI>Israels Redemption out of</HI> Egypt began when <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron met and kissed each other in the Mount of God,</HI> Exod 4 17. Satan labours to make breaches between us; our Adversaries put us together and make us their <HI>Butts</HI> to shoot at, (Priests and Rulers) God puts us together, unites us in giving us the same Titles, Ministers, Fathers, Nurses, Elders, Shepherds, <HI>God leads his people like a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ock to the promised Land by the hand of Moses and Aaron,</HI> Psal. 77. 20.</P>
<P N="4">4. Let all the Ordinances of the Lord Jesus Christ be precious to yon, own all Christs Institutions invisibly and visibly, let not any of you be found among them that turn your backs upon any Ordinance of Christ Jesus, own and love them heartily for God &amp; your own souls sake, and vi|sibly for your Generations sake, you are <HI>Leaders,</HI> if a Leader turn his back

<P N="5">5. Let Gods Sabbaths be of high and honourable account in your eyes,; remember the fourth <HI>Commandment</HI> that doth concern you; let Sabbaths be prophaned farewel all Religion, be careful that neither through Idleness, Sloathfulness or Prophaness the Sabbaths of the Lord our God be polluted among us; they are questioned by many, denied by others, prophaned by others, Oh remember <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> and his care upon this account, <HI>Chap.</HI> 13. 15&mdash;22.

<P N="6">6. Let no Plantation in this Jurisdiction (if it may with your care be possibly prevented) be without a <HI>Teaching Ministry;</HI> such places will prove <HI>Nurseries</HI> of <HI>Ignorance, Atheism, Heresie</HI> and <HI>Prophaness:</HI> we read of three great wants in <HI>Israel</HI> that were causes of woe to them, <HI>Judg.</HI> 5. 8. <HI>Judg. ult. ult.</HI> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 13. 19, 22. there was no <HI>King,</HI> no <HI>Smi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">h,</HI> no <HI>Sword</HI> nor <HI>Spear,</HI> and a fourth as had or worse then any, no <HI>Ministry,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15. 3. <HI>then they were without God,</HI> Eph. 2. 12. the more careless Children are of themselves, the more care their Parents should take for them.</P>
<P N="7">7. Tollerate not things that are intollerable, a boundless Toleration will be found at last an intollerable thing; such as differ only in Cir|cumstantials, <HI>Controversal points</HI> and are quiet, peaceable, moderate, and do not busy themselves in learning others, we may and must bear with them, <HI>Phil.</HI> 3. 15, 16. but when persons erre in Fundamentals, <HI>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ny Christ Jesus, the Word of God, Eternal Election,</HI> &amp;c. such Heresies and Hereticks had need be suppressed.</P>

<P N="3">3. Be not too ready to hear complaints, give not ear to any one party that may prepossess you, as God ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">th given you two ears, if you have one for the Complainant, reserve the other for the Defendant, Judge no mans Case so much as in your breast, be|fore you hear <HI>him and his Accusers face to face,</HI> Act. 25. 16.

<P N="4">4. <HI>Look to Witnesses,</HI> many do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ot understand the nature of an Oath, do not fear an Oath, such should be solemnly warned; <HI>if Truth fall in the Streets equity cannot enter,</HI> Isai. 59. 14.

<P N="5">5. <HI>Look to Attourneys,</HI> the stating of <HI>Atturneys</HI> that are appro|ved for Faithfulness, it may in some respect be inconvenient, but the suppressing of such as will for their own ends espouse any Case right or wrong, and by their wits put a fair Cloak upon a soul Case, and create needless Suits, and he <HI>incendiaries</HI> in places, and main|tain Contention that Contention may maintain them, such as care

not who looses, so they may gain, I say, to suppress such will be of great use to the maintenance of Justice and Peace</P>
