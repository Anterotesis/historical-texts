<HEAD>Reasons offered to the Council by his Excellency the Go|vernour, against passing the Bill raising 2593 l. 6 s. 8 d.</HEAD>
<P><HI>First,</HI> THe Bill does not answer the end, there is no Provision made for the Expence of Officers that must be imployed to the Neigh|bouring <HI>C</HI>ollonies, in raising of the Men, nor for the incidental Charge of marching and transporting the Men to the Fronteers, if they can be raised, (which is yet a doubt) And allowing the Money to be all solvent, and paid at the time appointed (which can never be expected) it cannot answer the Sum of three Pounds a Man, Levy Money, which must be in|stantly paid them in hand.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> If these Men cannot be levyed upon this Encouragement, there is no Provision made for the security of the Province. Money without hands gives no Defence&punc; And though you may allow me to be judge of the <HI>In|evitable Necessity,</HI> the Representatives plainly show they are not of this Opinion, by refusing to allow such a Proviso to be put in the Bill.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> By this Bill the <HI>P</HI>ower of Detachments seems to be cut off for a twelve Month, the words [<HI>Inevitable Necessity</HI>] will need an Explanation,
<PB REF="000757_0009_0FAA47B8ECC72A50">
which the Assembly (as they have done in another case) will always pre|tend to be <HI>j</HI>udges of, by which means the People will be blown up to a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and deny Obedience to my Commands, be the Necessity never to great and inevitable.</P>

<HEAD>Reasons offered by the Council for the passing of the Bill for raising Two Thousand five hundred Ninety three Pounds, six Shillings and eight Pence, &amp;c. Is amended by the Assembly, the 23d of April, 1696.</HEAD>
<P>WE are humbly of Opinion with your Excellency, That this <HI>B</HI>ill does not fully nor perfectly answer the end, but we do humbly offer, That after many Debates and Conferences with the Committees of the said Assembly upon these Heads, We do not find any other better ways or means can be at present obtained. And that although there is by the said Act no provision made for incidental Charges, that must certainly accrue in the imploying O<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">cers for the procuring, levying and transport|ing such men as shall be so got, yet in regard the disposition of this Money for this end, is left to be imployed, as your Excellency shall judge fit, We are of Opinion, That such part thereof as may be needful, and can be presently raised, may be properly applicable to the imploying Officers, for that end, to the Neighbouring Provinces.</P>
<P>To the <HI>Second,</HI> We are humbly of Opinion, That though in express words, in case the way of raising Men by this <HI>B</HI>ill, without Detachment, fail, there is no other certain way proposed, yet we are humbly of Opi|nion, That if after all means used for levying these Men without Detach|ments, they cannot be got, it must then be understood, there will then be an Inevitable Necessity for detaching Men out of this Province, and that your Excellency will be pleased to send for the whole House, and so explain that Clause to them.</P>
<P>To the <HI>Third,</HI> We do humbly offer our Opinion to your Excellency, That by this Act, your Excellency's Power of Detaching is not out off, but restrained, as in the fore-going Article is explained, and such an Explanation must prevent all Mis-interpretations on that Head.</P>
<P>For which Reasons. We are humbly of Opinion, That it is agreeable to his Majesties Service, and for the ease and benefit of this Province, that your Excellency do give your assent unto the said Bill, which is humbly submitted by</P>

<HEAD>His Excellency the Governour's Speech to the Assembly at their Adjournment, April 24. 1696.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. Speaker, and you Gentlemen Representatives,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THis is the chief Bill upon which our Safety hinges, its for Money to levy Men to recruit his Majesties Companies, for the strengthening of the Fronteers: I have some Exceptions to the wording of it, and the Substance: I was against the passing of it, and gave my Reasons to the Council: It does not seem to answer the end. The Gentlemen of the Council have given me their Opinions under their Hands for passing of it. I have resigned my Reason to theirs, and therefore pass it.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI> I am as tender of the Peoples Ease as any of you, and have earnestly both studied that and their safety. Yet if Men cannot be found for the encouragement you enable me to give, notwithstanding the endea|vours and pains I shall take to procure them, and the Fronteers become weak and exposed, I shall think the necessity of Detachments <HI>Inevitable,</HI> being resolved not to lose one foot of this <HI>P</HI>rovince while I have Hands to defend it. When the Disease is desperate, the Cure must be so, and as this is the sharpest Remedy, it shall be the last I shall use, and obvious to all good Men the necessity is inevitable.</P>
<P>The <HI>Second</HI> is a Bill for payment of Debts, contracted long before my arrival: It is commendable in you to keep up the Credit of the Government. I have been as good a Husband of the King's Revenue as ever I was of my own private Fortune. I understand not an Account, I left that part to the Gentlemen of the Council, who are of the greatest Interest amongst you, whom I believe to be honest Men, and to have dealt fairly in the matter of the Publick Accounts.</P>
<P>The <HI>Third</HI> is a Bill to cut off a Deed of Trust, with Uses, for payment of Debts, it is private. I suppose most of your Affairs will call you home I think fit to adjourn you to the 29th of <HI>September</HI> next, and desire Mr, Speaker to adjourn the House accordingly.</P>
