From eastern climes the famous Griswold came,</L>
<L>Whose thirst for honor fed ambition's flame;</L>
<L>Early he rose to posts of trust and gain,</L>
<L>And early fell to infamy again;</L>
<L>In buffoon wit and impudence he shone,</L>
<L>Yet thought no wisdom could excell his own.</L>
<L>'Gainst freedom's cause a furious war he wag'd,</L>
<L>And factious daemons in his bosom rag'd.</L>
<L>Such was the man whom future bards shall sing,</L>

<L>Whose nervous arm did wield the hick'ry cane</L>
<L>Upon his unarm'd foe's defenceless brain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now the council of the western world</L>
<L>The fates of nations and of states unfurl'd;</L>
<L>The wise, the great, the patriot and the sage,</L>
<L>In learn'd debate did each with warmth engage.</L>
<L>Brave Gallia's sons, so late our warmest friends,</L>
<L>Complain'd of trespass and requir'd amends;</L>
<L>Our ships they plunder'd, and our commerce spoil'd,</L>
<L>And all our trade in ruin's gulf embroil'd;</L>
<L>Denounc'd dire vengeance and in angry mood.</L>
<L>Declar'd if longer in their light we stood,</L>
<L>Our plains they'd deluge in the crimson flood.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="035052_0007_0FFFFA60F903CB70">
Indignant millions caught the dread alarm,</L>
<L>While <HI>amor patriae</HI> nerv'd each hero's arm,</L>
<L>And all with horror view'd th' approaching storm.</L>
<L>In this great crisis of impending fate,</L>
<L>(I blush when I the shameful tale relate)</L>
<L>That cordial friendship once our council's boast,</L>
<L>On this occasion was forgot and lost;</L>
<L>If one's opinion differ'd from the rest,</L>
<L>Malicious rancor lurk'd in ev'ry breast</L>
<L>Against the man who dar'd their will oppose,</L>
<L>Or who against their fav'rite schemes arose.</L>
<L>Thus persecution's unrelenting hand,</L>
<L>E'en to this place with fury did extend.</L>
<L>'Twas thus the pattern of all realms beside,</L>
<L>Had dwindled down to selfishness and pride.</L>
<L>While Congress then each threat'ning cloud sur|vey'd,</L>
<L>And schemes and plans in wisdom's scales were weigh'd,</L>
<L>A deed was done, which casts eternal shame</L>
<L>On hist'ry's leaf, and blots the page of fame.</L>
<L>In private converse numbers were engag'd,</L>

<L>And who ere long will give their feelings vent;</L>

<L>Meanwhile, the man whom Lyon had expos'd,</L>
<L>With anger fir'd to see his views oppos'd,</L>
<L>Now felt his pluck fast rising in his throat,</L>

A peal of laughter burst from diff'rent lungs,</L>
<L>At this the wittiest of all witty tongues.</L>
<L>The sage conceal'd his ire (if aught he found)</L>
<L>Suppress'd his feelings and despis'd the sound.</L>
<L>While thus resum'd his yet undaunted strain,</L>
<L>And calm, address'd th' attentive croud again:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Yes, gentlemen, were I to try my hand,</L>
<L>I'd change the creed of that deluded land;</L>
<L>They'd soon discharge this selfish set of men,</L>
<L>And then would justice rear her head again;</L>
<L>I'd soon dispel those fable mists, that rise</L>
<L>And shed delusion o'er the people's eyes;</L>
<L>I'd tear the veil with one consuming blast,</L>
<L>Which o'er their faces has so long been cast,</L>
<L>And form a revolution in their minds at last.</L>
<L>Ere long, should fortune my endeavors bless,</L>
<L>Perhaps I'll try them with a Printing-Press,</L>
<L>And then I'll shed th' effulgent blaze around,</L>

<L><PB N="11" REF="035052_0010_0FFFFA18C0503340">
With hasty steps straight from his seat he rose,</L>
<L>And plac'd himself just under Lyon's nose;</L>
<L>Then jogg'd his arm, determin'd to be heard,</L>
<L>Affected coolness in his mien appear'd;</L>
<L>While frequent grins his inward mind betray'd,</L>
<L>With much <HI>sang froid</HI> deliberate he said&mdash;</L>
<L>"Should you go there according to your word,</L>
<L>Sir, would you take along your <HI>wooden sword?"</HI></L>
<L>This pierc'd too far; his patience now was spent,</L>
<L>His bosom rag'd to give its feelings vent;</L>
<L>The foaming torrent, burst the stormy place,</L>
<L>And shed its moist contents on Griswold's face.</L>
<L>Thus sweetly bath'd, the hero took alarm,</L>
<L>Half choak'd with rage, he brac'd his nervous arm,</L>
<L>Prepar'd to strike the all destroying blow,</L>
<L>Which straight should send him to the realms be|low;</L>
<L>But suddenly he check'd his furious ire,</L>
<L>Suppress'd a while his fierce revengeful fire;</L>
<L>Perhaps he thought, "should I begin the treat,</L>
<L>I might get d&mdash;'d black eyes and sorely beat;</L>
<L>Whereas, should Dayton lift th' avenging rod,</L>
<L>He'd drive him hence, and save a deal of blood,</L>

But, should my colleagues not approve the plan,</L>
<L>I'll steal a sly revenge whene'er I can."</L>
<L>Lull'd with this tho't, he brook'd the vile disgrace,</L>

<L>The direful storm which then should burst its way,</L>
<L>When Lyon should unarm'd by him be seen,</L>

High on his throne, old HERCULES he spy'd,</L>
<L>Then bow'd submissive, and thus trembling cry'd;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Father of might, indulge my small request,</L>
<L>A Lyon doth my mortal frame infest;</L>
<L>Lend me thy club, or one small part at least,</L>
<L>That I may fly to kill the angry beast."</L>
<L>The nervous god, with much contempt, reply'd;</L>
<L>'Thou wield my club! what vain presumptuous pride!</L>
<L>Vain mortal, know my club is not so small,</L>
<L>It weighs as much as thou dost, guts and all:</L>
<L>But, to content thee, if thou hast a knife.</L>
<L>I'll split enough to take the Lyon's life."</L>
<L>Th' indulgent god, cut, while he dreamt no harm,</L>
<L>A stick as big, almost, as Griswold's arm.</L>
<L>(But had he known what Lyon 'twas he meant,</L>
<L>To PLUTO's realms Sir Griswold had been sent,</L>
<L>For <HI>Herkey</HI> was, as I have heard it said,</L>
<L>As good a whig as ever wore a head.)</L>
<L>With gratitude he bow'd, and grimly smil'd,</L>
<L>Pursu'd his journey through the trackless wild;</L>
<L>Arriv'd on earth, the heav'n-wro't club he twirl'd</L>
<L>Around his head, and banter'd all the world.</L>

Tow'rds Congress hall his hasty steps he bent,</L>
<L>To give the storm within its dreadful vent;</L>
<L>The happy chance now met his watchful eye,</L>
<L>His Lyon now unarm'd he saw with joy;</L>
<L>His head uncover'd, and his cane aside.</L>
<L>With flashing eyes the' approaching hero spy'd;</L>
<L>His lifted arm with tenfold vigor grasp'd,</L>
<L>He breath'd dire vengeance while the club he clasp'd:</L>
<L>When Hercules the Nemaean lion fought,</L>
<L>And hard to kill the furious beast he wrought,</L>
<L>With horrid cracks the thund'ring strokes resound,</L>
<L>And echoing woods repeat the noise around:</L>
<L>Our hero thus, his direful vengeance fed,</L>
<L>With equal fury on his foe's bare head</L>
<L>Thus unprepar'd: th' astonish'd Lyon rose,</L>
<L>And sought a refuge from the furious blows;</L>
<L>'Till clos'd alike, in angry conflict bound,</L>
<L>They both at length came tumbling to the ground.</L>
<L>Our thund'ring speaker view'd the scene awhile,</L>
<L>And <HI>horribly he grinn'd a ghastly smile!</HI></L>
<L>'Till some less sanguine flew to Lyon's aid,</L>
<L>And thus awhile the furious combat staid.</L>

Our Lyon now, astonish'd and perplex'd,</L>
<L>To find himself thus beaten, bruis'd and vex'd,</L>
<L>Was forc'd at present to endure his fate,</L>
<L>Yet vow'd to crush the coward soon or late.</L>
<L>Fortune ere long revers'd the former scene,</L>
<L>And wink'd to Lyon to emit his spleen;</L>
<L>Our injur'd wight the pressing moment caught,</L>
<L>And brac'd the arm which ne'er in vain had wro't,</L>
<L>But Griswold, ere the thund'ring storm began,</L>
<L>Escap'd the field and from the battle ran;</L>
<L>Till some <HI>humane,</HI> some <HI>sympathizing</HI> hand,</L>
<L>Convey'd a weapon to his flying friend:</L>
<L>But now alas, the <HI>thundering</HI> Speaker bawl'd,</L>
<L>And <HI>order</HI> soon from ev'ry side was call'd;</L>
<L>Our <HI>order-loving</HI> Dayton, fore afraid,</L>
<L>To see his darling get a broken head,</L>
<L>Soon found a way to check the gath'ring storm,</L>
<L>And screen his Griswold from impending harm.</L>
<L>When much debate on ev'ry side had past,</L>
<L>They came to this conclusive point at last;</L>
<L><HI>That they no more their country should disgrace,</HI></L>
<L><HI>But</HI> FIGHT IT OUT, <HI>some other time and place!</HI></L>

<L>Thus ends the tale, which stamps eternal shame</L>
<L>On freedom's sons, and on Columbia's name;</L>
