<HEAD>A NARRATIVE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>MR. ROBERT FORBES, not being a na|tive of Canada, but having re&s;ided there &s;e|veral years, was de&s;irous of being where he might have a more frequent opportunity of a&s;&s;ociating with his own countrymen.</P>
<P>He and his wife had premeditated a removal to the United States of America, when falling in com|pany with three men, by the names of Mid&s;taff, Pancake, and Chri&s;tian, they were induced, by their in&s;inuations, to undertake the journey by land: the &s;aid Mid&s;taff engaging, for a certain &s;um, that with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the other two, he would conduct them, in twelve days time, to the &s;ettle|ment on Kennebeck River.</P>
<P>Mr. Forbes' neighbours endeavoured to di&s;&s;uade him from the attempt, not only on account of the length and difficulty of the way, but becau&s;e there was a po&s;&s;ibility of his being de&s;erted by his guides in the mid&s;t of the wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, being determined on a removal, and having paid to Mid&s;taff a large &s;tipulated &s;um
<PB N="4" REF="026698_0003_0FD15B6B1387DCD8">
for that purpo&s;e, on the &s;eventeenth day of March, A. D. one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and eighty-four, they entered upon this unfortunate journey.</P>
<P>From Nouvelle Bois, on the river Chadore, they took their departure. The men and Mrs. Forbes, (who was then pregnant), and Mr. Forbes' &s;on John, a lad about thirteen years old, on &s;now &s;hoes.</P>
<P>Their provi&s;ions and other effects, together with four children, viz. Mary, about &s;even years; Peg|gy, about five; Catharine, about three; Robert, about fifteen months old, they undertook to haul on Indian &s;leighs, or hand &s;leds.</P>
<P>In this manner, but with great difficulty, they pur&s;ued their way eight days; and on the ninth, being obliged to leave the river which they had fol|lowed hitherto, and whereon they had travelled &s;ome part of the time, they found the country &s;o broken with large and deep gullies, and &s;o rough and mountainous, that they concluded it next to impo&s;&s;ible to proceed any further with the &s;leighs.</P>
<P>Here they were obliged to make a halt; and af|ter a &s;hort con&s;ultation, having fir&s;t erected a &s;mall camp, to leave the woman and children in, they took the chief part of their provi&s;ions, and as much of the re&s;t of their baggage as they were able to car|ry on their backs; and leaving the woman and chil|dren, about ten o'clock in the morning, &s;et out in que&s;t of Meconick Pond, otherwi&s;e called Lake Chadore, expecting to return the next day. But meeting much difficulty, they did not reach the pond until the next day about three o'clock in the afternoon.</P>
<P>Here being much fatigued, they left their bag|gage; and Mid&s;taff having had &s;ome previous no|tice that there was an Indian re&s;iding not far from thence, went in que&s;t of him to the other &s;ide of the
<PB N="5" REF="026698_0004_0FD15B6C94F12138">
pond, where they found an old camp, without in|habitants; and there they encamped that night.</P>
<P>The next morning, being Sunday, the twenty-&s;eventh day of March, they cro&s;&s;ed the pond back to where they had left their baggage. When, to the great a&s;toni&s;hment of Mr. Forbes, his pilot and the other two, taking to them&s;elves the provi&s;ions, and his other effects of any con&s;iderable con&s;equence, frankly told him, that they were determined not to return with him to his family; and that they mu&s;t now leave him, and make the be&s;t of their way through to Kennebeck.</P>
<P>This may well be &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;hocking indeed to one who was already di&s;couraged and di&s;hearten|ed. "This," &s;aid he,
<Q>&s;truck me to the heart, and filled my eyes with tears; it confirmed what my neighbours had repeatedly mentioned among&s;t their fears of what might happen to my&s;elf and family.</Q></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding his importunities, his mo&s;t ear|ne&s;t entreaties and &s;olicitations, they would not be prevailed upon to continue any longer with him; but, leaving him only one axe, a &s;mall firelock, and two loaves of bread, they departed.</P>
<P>With a heavy heart did this unfortunate man then make the be&s;t of his way back to his family; where he arrived that evening, with the &s;orrowful tidings.</P>
<P>Here were they left in the wide wilderne&s;s, &s;tran|gers to the country, de&s;titute of provi&s;ions, and without a compa&s;s; eight days journey from the inhabitants in Canada, and how far from any other &s;ettlement they knew not; probably not le&s;s than one hundred and fifty miles.</P>
<P>The wife and &s;on had laboured under the mo&s;t terrible apprehen&s;ions during Mr. Forbes's ab&s;ence, e&s;pecially &s;eeing he did not return at the time ap|pointed. Their fears had almo&s;t driven them to de&s;|pair;
<PB N="6" REF="026698_0005_0FD15B6E58B21CF0">
and the poor lad, a little before his father's return, had fatigued him&s;elf almo&s;t to death, hav|ing followed their tracks for &s;everal miles; and had ju&s;t got back when his father arrived.</P>
<P>The next morning they were in the mo&s;t doubtful perplexity whether to go backward or forward. Should they undertake to return to Canada, it might take them more than double the length of time in which they had got thus far, the river being then a|bout breaking up; and in that ca&s;e they mu&s;t inevi|tably &s;tarve.</P>
<P>When the hu&s;band and wife were in this pitiable &s;ituation, gazing at each other, and tears gu&s;hing from their eyes, their children were hanging around them, and crying bitterly, for a mor&s;el of bread.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, as the before-mentioned two loaves of bread, were in the way towards Kennebeck, and as they might, peradventure, find the Indian at Meconick pond, they concluded, by the help of God, to proceed on their journey.</P>
<P>Accordingly they left the mo&s;t cumber&s;ome, though nece&s;&s;ary articles, which they had now re|maining, and the elde&s;t daughter undertook to tra|vel on foot with her mother, while Mr. Forbes took two of the children, and John one, upon &s;leds; and thus they proceeded with as much di&s;patch as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The way, however, was rough; and they travel|led but a &s;hort di&s;tance during that day. At night, they encamped, and the next morning there came on a violent &s;torm of rain, hail, and &s;now, which continued until Wedne&s;day evening. In the mean while, the children were pinched with hunger and with the cold; and their cries were &s;o bitterly di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing, that, leaving the mother and children in camp, the father and &s;on pu&s;hed forward with all &s;peed to the pond; but it was &s;till &s;tormy, and the
<PB N="7" REF="026698_0006_0FD15B6F930CD8A8">
travelling &s;o difficult, that they did not get back with the two loaves until Wedne&s;day evening.</P>
<P>Upon their return, they had not a dry thing a|bout them, nor any dry clothes to put on. And to add to their misfortune, the fire was extingui&s;hed, and they were unable to rekindle it for the whole night.</P>
<P>The next morning, the &s;torm being con&s;iderably abated, they proceeded on their journey; but the trees and bu&s;hes being wet, they had an uncomfort|able time, and did not reach the pond until Friday morning about ten o'clock.</P>
<P>Soon after this, to their great con&s;olation, they met with the beforementioned Indian, who proved to be one John Bapti&s;t, and with whom they had had &s;ome previous acquaintance in Canada.&mdash;He very ho&s;pitably invited them to his camp, which was at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from the pond; and there he kindly treated them with the be&s;t of what his hou&s;e afforded.</P>
<P>This was a camp where his wife re&s;ided, while he followed hunting. Here they tarried until the next Monday. And the Indian having, ju&s;t before their meeting, killed a moo&s;e, at a few miles di&s;tance, Mr. Forbes and his &s;on went with their &s;leds, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in bringing it home.</P>
<P>The Indian gave them as much moo&s;e meat as they would undertake to carry; and agreed to pilot them to Kennebeck river.&mdash;This agreement he punc|tually fulfilled; and would have proceeded with them to the &s;ettlements, but his wife was &s;o &s;ick that he did not dare to be any longer ab&s;ent from her. He therefore marked the way on a piece of bark, repre&s;enting the bends, windings, falls, and carrying places along the river.&mdash;He then wi&s;hed them well, and left them.</P>
<P>On taking leave of the Indian, they could not ex|pre&s;s
<PB N="8" REF="026698_0007_0FD15B7126AC3CF0">
their gratitude. His kindne&s;s was beyond their expectation.&mdash;Before his departure, however, they gave him what things they had left behind, together with &s;ome other things of con&s;iderable value. And they had rea&s;on afterwards to wi&s;h that they had pre|&s;ented him with more; for their loads proved &s;o much too heavy for them, that they were obliged to leave by the way a large bag full of valuable articles.</P>
<P>They now met with almo&s;t in&s;urmountable difficul|ties; for in pur&s;uing the river, their progre&s;s was ob&s;tructed by craggy windfalls, rocky ledges, lofty mountains, and hideous precipices.</P>
<P>On the twelfth day of April, their provi&s;ions were exhau&s;ted; and Mrs. Forbes thought it mo&s;t advi&s;a|ble to have a camp erected, and for her&s;elf and the children to remain there, while her hu&s;band and olde&s;t &s;on &s;hould go forward to &s;ee whether they could find the inhabitants&mdash;apprehending that they were much nearer than they afterwards proved to be.</P>
<P>A camp was therefore erected, and leaving Mrs. Forbes with her four young children, Mr. Forbes and his &s;on went forward with as much &s;peed as po&s;&s;ible. The fir&s;t and &s;econd days, finding the ice would bear them, they travelled on the river; and would have made con&s;iderable progre&s;s, but unfor|tunately they mi&s;took their way at a very material carrying place, where, in&s;tead of leaving the river, and cro&s;&s;ing by land to the next bend, which was only twelve miles, they followed the river &s;ixty miles around.</P>
<P>A little before night, the &s;econd day, they came to falls, and could go no further on the ice. They went on &s;hore, and &s;oon after came to a precipice where they were obliged to de&s;cend twenty feet al|mo&s;t perpendicularly, and at the ri&s;que of being da&s;hed upon the rocks.&mdash;Night coming on, they encamped; and the next day, finding a &s;hoal rocky
<PB N="9" REF="026698_0008_0FD15B734C0A8500">
place in the river, they cro&s;&s;ed over to the other &s;ide, in hopes of finding better travelling, and a more convenient place to encamp. Here they were obliged by rea&s;on of &s;tormy weather, to encamp for the remainder of the day.</P>
<P>The next day they travelled on; and perceiving the river to be almo&s;t clear of ice, they concluded to build a kind of raft&mdash;a thing with which they were altogether unacquainted, and by means of which they had both like to have lo&s;t their lives.</P>
<P>A few days after they got on the raft, and under way about ten o'clock in the morning. The cur|rent, however, ran &s;o &s;wift, that they &s;oon found there was no po&s;&s;ibility of turning it to the &s;hore. As they pa&s;&s;ed down the river, they &s;truck again&s;t a tree, which they were obliged to cut away, in or|der to clear the raft. When they de&s;cended over ripples, the water never failed of da&s;hing over them, &s;o that they were wet continually.</P>
<P>About the middle of the day, the raft moving with great rapidity, &s;truck a large rock, parted one of its corners, and &s;pread into a &s;ingle &s;tring of logs. At this time they lo&s;t their axe, and it be|came extremely difficult to keep upon their broken machine.</P>
<P>They were, from this time, driven with amazing rapidity, expecting every moment would be their la&s;t, until about four o'clock in the afternoon; when, falling into an eddy, they were brought up by a point of land, and both got &s;afe on &s;hore.</P>
<P>They now travelled on by land until their &s;trength was almo&s;t exhau&s;ted. About the twentieth of A|pril, they heard the report of a gun, which &s;eemed to give them new life. They fired &s;everal times, but were not an&s;wered. Then, concluding that it might be nothing more than the falling of a tree,
<PB N="10" REF="026698_0009_0FD15B7439EAF338">
their &s;pirits again &s;unk within them, and they mov|ed on with heavy hearts.</P>
<P>But on the evening of the twenty-&s;econd, having kindled a &s;mall fire upon an eminence, they were di&s;covered, and kindly relieved by two hunters&mdash;Jo|nathan Cro&s;by and Luke Sawyer.</P>
<P>It was now the tenth day &s;ince they left Mrs. For|bes and the children. And during this time they had eaten up all the moo&s;e meat which they had ta|ken with them (it being only two or three ounces) and their mogga&s;ons&mdash;having had nothing el&s;e to &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon.</P>
<P>The hunters &s;upplied them with &s;uch articles of nouri&s;hment as they had with them; and then con|ducted them to the &s;ettlements at Seven Mile Brook, a little above Norridgewalk, where they arrived in a few hours; but &s;o reduced, that they were &s;carce|ly able to &s;tand alone.</P>
<P>Upon their arrival, Mr. Forbes procured major Hale, William Hu&s;ton, and Ebenezer Hilton, three of the mo&s;t &s;uitable men that could be found, to go with all &s;peed to the relief of his wife and children. They &s;et out immediately, and after having been gone thirteen days, returned without having been able to find them.</P>
<P>It was now twenty-four days from the time Mr. Forbes left them, with only one pound and an half of moo&s;e meat, and a pound and a half of tallow, for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence: It was the general opinion, therefore, that they mu&s;t have been dead.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, Mr. Forbes' anxiety would not per|mit him to re&s;t &s;atisfied until he had procured two other per&s;ons, Me&s;&s;rs. James M'Donald and Jona|than Ames, to go with him, and &s;ee whether they might not be &s;till alive. But by this time, all the low lands adjacent to the river were overflowed, which rendered the pa&s;&s;ing extremely difficult. For
<PB N="11" REF="026698_0010_0FD15B75AB195B10">
this rea&s;on, and becau&s;e they had no expectation of finding them alive, they could not be prevailed up|on to &s;et off until the waters were abated.</P>
<P>On the twenty-eighth day of May, they &s;et out. Having travelled one day, Mr. Forbes found him&s;elf unable to keep up with them; and upon their tel|ling him he could be of no &s;ervice, and that he might depend upon their fidelity, he con&s;ented to return.</P>
<P>They proceeded on their way, and, on the &s;econd day of June, arrived at the place where Mrs. Forbes and her children were left. And here, to their great a&s;toni&s;hment, they found the mother and one of her children alive. It was now fifty days &s;ince they were left with nothing be&s;ides the before mentioned moo&s;e meat and tallow. Nor had they any thing el&s;e dur|ing that whole time, excepting cold water, and the in&s;ide bark of the fir tree. And in addition to this, they had been forty-eight days without fire.</P>
<P>To paint in proper colours this &s;cene of di&s;tre&s;s, is altogether beyond my powers of de&s;cription. It mu&s;t be left to the imagination of the reader.</P>
<P>On the thirty-eighth day after the departure of Mr. Forbes, the little boy expired. Catharine died the next day; and Mary lived but four days longer. This la&s;t child had often told her mother, they &s;hould all certainly &s;tarve to death; and earne&s;tly begged, in ca&s;e her mother &s;hould outlive her, that &s;he might be put where the wild bea&s;ts could not devour her.</P>
<P>The poor woman was her&s;elf but ju&s;t alive, and expected every hour to clo&s;e the eyes of Peggy, her only remaining child and companion. The bodies of the decea&s;ed children were laid out, and kept by her &s;ide: For &s;he was unable to bury them&mdash;having been &s;o weak, for the la&s;t fifteen days, that &s;he had been obliged to crawl upon her hands and knees to the &s;pring for water.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="026698_0011_0FD15B7712D13ED8">The breath of life, however, was &s;till remaining in them. And the two men who came to their relief, afforded them &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and admini&s;tered to them &s;uch nouri&s;hment as their &s;ituation and circum|&s;tances required.</P>
<P>On the third day of June they &s;et out for home; and carried Mrs. Forbes and the child on a bier by land, and in a canoe by water, till they all &s;afely ar|rived at Norridgewalk: where, to the &s;urprize of the inhabitants, and the utter a&s;toni&s;hment of Mr. Forbes, he was once more pre&s;ented with a living wife, and one living child.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion, well might he adopt the lan|guage of holy DAVID&mdash;in who&s;e words we &s;hall now clo&s;e the narrative:
<Q><LG>
<L>MY &s;oul with grateful thoughts of love</L>

<HEAD>A NARRATIVE OF THE CAPTIVITY and ESCAPE of Mrs. <HI>Frances Scott,</HI> An inhabitant of Wa&s;hington county, Virginia.</HEAD>
<P>ON Wedne&s;day, the 29th of June, 1785, late in the evening, a large company of armed men pa&s;&s;ed the hou&s;e, on their way to Kentucky: Some of whom encamped within two miles. Mr. Scott living on a fron|tier part, generally made the family watchful; but on this calamitous day, after &s;o large a body of men had pa&s;&s;ed, &s;hortly after night he lay down in his bed, and imprudently left one of the doors of his hou&s;e open &mdash;the children were all in bed, and a&s;leep. Mrs. Scott was nearly un|dre&s;&s;ed, when, to her unutterable a&s;toni&s;hment and horror, &s;he &s;aw ru&s;h|ing in through the door that was left open, painted &s;avages, with pre&s;ent|ed arms, rai&s;ing a hideous &s;hriek&mdash;Mr. Scott being awake, in&s;tantly jumped out of bed, but was immediately fired at: he forced his way through the middle of the enemy, and got out of the door, but fell a few paces from thence. An Indian &s;eized Mrs. Scott, and ordered her to a particular &s;pot, and not to move: others &s;tabbed and cut the throats of the three younge&s;t children in their bed. And afterwards lifted them up and da&s;hed them down to the floor, near the mother; the elde&s;t, a beau|tiful girl of eight years old, awoke, and e&s;caped out of the bed, and ran to her parent, and with a mo&s;t plaintive accent, cried, "O mamma! mamma! &s;ave me,"&mdash;the mother, in the deepe&s;t angui&s;h of &s;pirit, and with a flood of tears, intreated the &s;avages to &s;pare her child, but with a brutal fiercene&s;s, they tomahawked and &s;tabbed her in the mother's arms. Adjacent to Mr. Scott's dwelling hou&s;e another family lived, of the name of Ball. The Indians al&s;o attacked them at the &s;ame in&s;tant they did Mr. Scott; but the door being &s;hut, the enemy fired into the hou&s;e through an opening between two logs, and killed a young lad, and then e&s;&s;ayed to force the door open, but a &s;urviving brother fired through the door, and the enemy de&s;i&s;ted, and went off; the remaining part of the family ran out of the hou&s;e and e&s;caped. In Mr. Scott's hou&s;e were four good rifles well loaded, belonging to people that had left it on their way to Kentucky. The Indians loaded them&s;elves with the plunder, be|ing
<PB N="15" REF="026698_0014_0FD15B7BDD50E9D0">
13 in number, and then &s;peedily made off, and continued travelling all night; next morning their chief allotted to each man his &s;hare, and detached nine of a party to &s;teal hor&s;es, from the inhabitants in Clinch. The eleventh day after Mrs. Scott's captivity, the four Indians after hav|ing her in charge, &s;topped at a place fixed on for a rendezvous, and to hunt, being now in great want of provi&s;ions. Three went out, and the chief, being an old man, was left to take care of the pri&s;oner, who, by this time, expre&s;&s;ed a willingne&s;s to proceed to the Indian towns, which &s;eemed to have the de&s;ired effect of le&s;&s;ening the keeper's vigilance. In the day time, as the old man was graining a deer &s;kin, the captive pon|dering on her &s;ituation, and anxiou&s;ly looking for an opportunity to make her e&s;cape, took the re&s;olution, and went to the Indian carele&s;sly, a&s;ked liberty to go a &s;mall di&s;tance to a &s;tream of water, to wa&s;h the blood off her apron, that had remained be&s;meared &s;ince the fatal night of the murder of her little daughter. He told her in the Engli&s;h tongue, "Go along;" &s;he then pa&s;&s;ed by him, his face being in a contrary direc|tion from that &s;he was going, and he very bu&s;y. She after getting to the water, proceeded on without delay, made to a high barren mountain, and travelled till late in the evening, when &s;he came down into the val|ley, in &s;earch of the track &s;he had been taken along; hoping thereby to find the way back, without the ri&s;k of being lo&s;t, and peri&s;hing with hun|ger in uninhabited parts. On coming acro&s;s the valley, on the river &s;ide, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the ea&s;terly branch of the Kentucky river, &s;he ob&s;erved in the &s;and, tracks of two men, that had gone up the river, and had ju&s;t re|turned. She concluded the&s;e to have been her pur&s;uers, which excited emotions of gratitude and thankfulne&s;s to divine providence for &s;o time|ly a deliverance. Being without any provi&s;ions, having no kind of wea|pon or tool to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in getting any, and being almo&s;t de&s;titute of cloth|ing; al&s;o knowing, that a va&s;t track of rugged high mountains interven|ed between where &s;he was and the inhabitants ea&s;twardly, and &s;he almo&s;t as ignorant as a child of the method of &s;teering through the woods, ex|cited painful &s;en&s;ations. But certainly death, either by hunger or wild bea&s;ts, &s;eemed to her better than to be in the power of beings, who had excited in her mind &s;uch horror. She addre&s;&s;ed Heaven for protection, and taking courage, proceeded onward.</P>
<P>After travelling three days, &s;he nearly met with the Indians, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, that had been &s;ent to Clinch to &s;teal hor&s;es, but providentially hearing their approach, concealed her&s;elf among the cane, until the ene|my had pa&s;&s;ed. This giving a fre&s;h alarm, and her mind being filled with con&s;ternation, &s;he got lo&s;t, proceeding backwards and forwards for &s;eve|ral days; at length &s;he came to a river, that &s;eemed to come from the ea&s;t; concluding it was Sandy river, &s;he accordingly re&s;olved to trace it to its &s;ource, which is adjacent to Clinch &s;ettlement. After proceed|ing up the &s;ame &s;everal days, &s;he came where the river runs through a great laurel mountain, where is a prodigious water fall, and numerous high craggy cliffs along the water edge; that way &s;eemed impa&s;&s;able, the mountain &s;teep and difficult: However, our mournful traveller concluded that the latter way was the be&s;t. She therefore a&s;cended for &s;ome time, but coming to a range of inacce&s;&s;ible rocks, &s;he turned her cour&s;e to|wards the foot of the mountain and the river &s;ide; after getting into a deep gulley, and pa&s;&s;ing over &s;everal high &s;teep rocks, &s;he reached the river &s;ide, where, to her inexpre&s;&s;ible affliction, &s;he found that a perpendi|cular rock, or rather one that hung over, of 15 or 20 feet high, formed the bank. Here a &s;olemn pau&s;e took place, &s;he e&s;&s;ayed a return; but the height of the &s;teps and rocks &s;he had de&s;cended over, prevented her.
<PB N="16" REF="026698_0015_0FD15B7D13ADA8A0">
She then returned to the edge of the precipice, and viewed the bottom of it, as the certain &s;pot to end all her troubles, or remain on the top to pine away in hunger, or be devoured by wild bea&s;ts. After &s;erious medi|tation and devout exerci&s;es, &s;he determined on leaping from the height, and accordingly jumped off. Although the place &s;he had to alight was covered with uneven rocks, not a bone was broken; but being exceed|ingly &s;tunned with the fall, &s;he remained unable to proceed for &s;ome time. The dry &s;ea&s;on cau&s;ed the river to be &s;hallow&mdash;&s;he travelled in it, and where &s;he could, by its edge, until &s;he got through the mountain, which &s;he concluded was &s;everal miles. After this, as &s;he was travelling along the bank of the river, a venomous &s;nake bit her on the ancle: &s;he had &s;trength to kill it; and knowing its kind, concluded that death mu&s;t &s;oon overtake her. By this time Mrs. Scott was reduced to a mere &s;keleton, with fatigue, hunger, and grief; probably this &s;tate of her body was the means of pre&s;erving her from the effects of the poi&s;on; be that as it may, &s;o it was, that very little pain &s;ucceeded the bite, and what little &s;welling there was, it fell into her feet. Our wanderer now left the river, and after proceeding a good di&s;tance, &s;he came to where the valley parted into two, each leading a different cour&s;e.&mdash;Here a painful &s;u&s;pen&s;e again took place; a forlorn creature, almo&s;t exhau&s;ted, and cer|tain if &s;he was far led out of the way, that &s;he would never &s;ee a human creature. During this doubt, a beautiful bird pa&s;&s;ed clo&s;e by her, flut|tering along the ground, and went out of &s;ight up one of the vallies. This drew her attention, and, whil&s;t con&s;idering what it might mean, another bird of the &s;ame appearance, in like manner fluttered pa&s;t her, and took the &s;ame valley the former had done. This determined her choice of her way; and in two days, which was on the 11th day of Au|gu&s;t, &s;he reached the &s;ettlement at Clinch, called New-Garden; whereas (&s;he is &s;ince informed by woodmen) had &s;he taken the other valley, it would have led back towards the Ohio. Mrs. Scott related that the In|dians told her, that the party was compo&s;ed of four different nations, two of whom &s;he thinks they named Delawares and Mingoes.</P>
<P>She further relates, that, during her wandering from the 10th of July to the 11th of Augu&s;t, &s;he had no other &s;ub&s;i&s;tence but chewing and &s;wallowing the juice of young cane &s;talks, &s;a&s;&s;afras leaves, and &s;ome o|ther plants &s;he did not know the name of; that, on her journey, &s;he &s;aw buffaloes, elks, deer, and frequently bears and wolves; not one of which, although &s;ome of them pa&s;&s;ed very near her, offered her any harm. One day a bear came near her, with a young fawn in his mouth, and on di&s;covering her, he dropped his prey and ran off. Hunger prompted her to go and take the fle&s;h, and eat it; but on reflection, &s;he de&s;i&s;ted, think|ing that the bear might return and devour her; be&s;ides, &s;he had an aver|&s;ion to ta&s;te raw fle&s;h.&mdash;Mrs. Scott continues in a low &s;tate of health, and remains incon&s;olable for the lo&s;s of her family, particularly bewail|ing the cruel death of her little daughter.</P>
