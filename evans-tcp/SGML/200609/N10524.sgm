<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>A BOOK without a preface is like a face without a no&s;e. Let the other features be ever &s;o agreeable and well poportioned, it is looked on with dete&s;tation and horror if this material ornament be wanting.</P>
<P>Or rather, a book is like a hou&s;e: The grand portico is the dedication; the flagged pavement is an humble addre&s;s to the reader, in order to <HI>pave</HI> the way for a kind reception of the work; the front door with its fluted pillars, pediment, trigliffs and modillions are the title page with its motto, author's name and titles, date of the year, &amp;c. The entry is the preface (oftentimes of a tedious length) and the &s;everal apartments and clo&s;ets are the chapters and &s;ections of the work it&s;elf.</P>
<P>As I am but a clum&s;y carpenter at be&s;t, I &s;hall not attempt to decorate my little cottage with any <HI>out of door</HI> ornaments; but as it would be inconvenient and uncomfortable to have my front door open immediately into the apartments of my hou&s;e, I have made this pre|face by way of entry.</P>
<P>And now, gentle reader, if you &s;hould think my entry too plain and &s;imple you may &s;et your

imagination to work, and furni&s;h it with a grand &s;tairca&s;e, with cornices, &s;tucco and paint|ings. That is, you may &s;uppo&s;e that I entered very unwillingly upon this work, being compel|led to it by a chain of unfore&s;een circum&s;tances: That it was written in the mid&s;t of a great hurry of other bu&s;ine&s;s, and under particular di&s;advantages of time and place, and that it was only intended for the in&s;pection of a few friends, without any expectations of ever &s;eeing it in the Pre&s;s.</P>
<P>You may, kind reader, go on to &s;uppo&s;e that when my friends peru&s;ed my work, they were &s;truck with the energy of my genius, and in&s;i&s;ted that the public ought not to be deprived of &s;uch a fund of amu&s;ement and improvement through my ob&s;tinate mode&s;ty; and that after many &s;oli|citations and powerful per&s;ua&s;ions I had been prevailed upon to ble&s;s mankind with the fruits of my labour.</P>
<P>Or, if you like not this, you may &s;uppo&s;e that the following &s;heets were found in the cabinet of &s;ome decea&s;ed gentleman; or that they were dug out of an ancient ruins, or di&s;covered in a Her|mit's Cave, or dropped from the clouds in a hail &s;torm. In &s;hort, you may &s;uppo&s;e ju&s;t what you plea&s;e.

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>ONCE upon a time, a great while ago, there lived a certain Nobleman, who had long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a very valua|ble farm, and had a great number of children and grandchildren.</P>
<P>BESIDES the annual profits of his land, which were very con&s;iderable, he kept a large &s;hop of goods; and being very &s;ucce&s;&s;|ful in trade, he became, in proce&s;s of time, exceeding rich and powerful; in&s;omuch that all his neighbours feared and re&s;pected him.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to the management of his family, it was thought he had adopted the mo&s;t perfect mode that could be devi&s;ed, for he had been at the pains to examine the oeco|nomy of all his neighbours, and had &s;elect|ed from their plans all &s;uch parts as appear|ed to be equitable and beneficial, and omit|ted tho&s;e which from experience were found
<PB N="6" REF="013339_0005_0F90552AA82924A8">
to be inconvenient. Or rather, by blend|ing their &s;everal con&s;titutions together he had &s;o ingeniou&s;ly counterbalanced the evils of one mode of government with the bene|fits of another, that the advantages were richly enjoyed, and the inconveniencies &s;carcely felt. In &s;hort, his family was thought to be the be&s;t ordered of any in his neighbourhood.</P>
<P>HE never exerci&s;ed any undue authority over his children or &s;ervants; neither in|deed could he oppre&s;s them if he was &s;o di&s;|po&s;ed; for it was particularly covenanted in his marriage articles that he &s;hould not at any time impo&s;e any ta&s;ks or hard&s;hips whatever upon his children without the free con&s;ent of his wife.</P>
<P>NOW the cu&s;tom in his family was this, that at the end of every &s;even years his mar|riage became of cour&s;e null and void; at which time his children and grandchildren met together and cho&s;e another wife for him, whom the old gentleman was obliged to marry under the &s;ame articles and re&s;tricti|ons as before. If his late wife had conduct|ed her&s;elf, during her &s;even years marriage, with mildne&s;s, di&s;cretion, and integrity, &s;he was re-elected; if otherwi&s;e, depo&s;ed: By which means the chidren had always a

great intere&s;t in their mother in law; and through her, a rea&s;onable check upon their father's temper. For be&s;ides that he could do nothing material re&s;pecting his children without her approbation, &s;he was &s;ole mi&s;|tre&s;s of the pur&s;e &s;trings; and gave him out, from time to time, &s;uch &s;ums of money as &s;he thought nece&s;&s;ary for the expences of his family.</P>
<P>BEING one day in a very extraordinary good humour, he gave his children a writ|ing under his hand and &s;eal, by which he relea&s;ed them from many badges of depen|dance, and confirmed to them &s;everal very important privileges. The chief were the two following, viz. That none of his chil|dren &s;hould be puni&s;hed for any offence, or &s;uppo&s;ed offence, until his brethren had fir&s;t declared him worthy of &s;uch puni&s;hment; and &s;econdly, he gave fre&s;h a&s;&s;urances that he would impo&s;e no hard&s;hips upon them without the con&s;ent of their mother in law.</P>
<P>THIS writing, on account of its &s;ingular importance, was called THE GREAT PAPER. After it was executed with the utmo&s;t &s;o|lemnity, he cau&s;ed his Chaplain to publi&s;h a dire <HI>Anathema</HI> against all who &s;hould attempt to violate the articles of the <HI>Great Paper,</HI> in the words following.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<P>NOW it came to pa&s;s that this Noble|man had, by &s;ome means or other, obtained a right to an immen&s;e tract of wild uncultivated country at a va&s;t di&s;tance from his man&s;ion hou&s;e. But he &s;et little &s;tore by this acqui&s;ition, as it yielded him no pro|fit, nor was it likely to do &s;o, being not only difficult of acce&s;s on account of the di&s;|tance, but was al&s;o overrun with innume|rable wild bea&s;ts very fierce and &s;avage; &s;o that it would be extremely dangerous to at|tempt taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>IN proce&s;s of time, however, &s;ome of his children, more &s;tout and enterpri&s;ing than the re&s;t, reque&s;ted leave of their father to go and &s;ettle on this di&s;tant tract of land. Leave was readily obtained; but before they &s;et out certain agreements were &s;tipulated be|tween them&mdash;the principal were&mdash;the old Gentleman, on his part, engaged to protect and defend the adventurers in their new &s;et|tlements; to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in chacing away the wild bea&s;ts, and to extend to them all the benefits of the government under which they were born: A&s;&s;uring them that al|though they &s;hould be removed &s;o far from his pre&s;ence they &s;hould neverthele&s;s be con|&s;idered
<PB N="10" REF="013339_0009_0F90553073DDAA08">
as the children of his family, and treated accordingly. At the &s;ame time he gave each of them a bond for the faithful performance of the&s;e promi&s;es; in which, among other things, it was covenanted that they &s;hould, each of them in their &s;everal fa|milies, have a liberty of making &s;uch rules and regulations for their own good govern|ment as they &s;hould find convenient; pro|vided the&s;e rules and regulations &s;hould not contradict or be incon&s;i&s;tent with the gene|ral &s;tanding orders e&s;tabli&s;hed in his farm.</P>
<P>IN return for the&s;e favours he in&s;i&s;ted that they, on their parts, &s;hould at all times ac|knowledge him to be their father; that they &s;hould not deal with their neighbours with|out his leave, but &s;end to his &s;hop only for &s;uch merchandize as they &s;hould want. But in order to enable them to pay for &s;uch goods as they &s;hould purcha&s;e, they were permitted to &s;ell the produce of their lands to certain of his neighbours.</P>
<P>THESE preliminaries being duly adju&s;t|ed, our adventurers bid adieu to the com|forts and conveniencies of their father's hou&s;e, and &s;et off on their journey.&mdash;Many and great were the difficulties they encoun|tered on their way: But many more and much greater had they to combat on their
<PB N="11" REF="013339_0010_0F9055309CF61BB8">
arrival in the new country. Here they found nothing but wild nature. Mountains overgrown with inacce&s;&s;ible &s;oliage, and plains &s;teeped in &s;tagnated waters. Their ears are no longer attentive to the repeated &s;trokes of indu&s;trious labour, and the bu&s;y hum of men, in&s;tead of the&s;e, the roaring tempe&s;t and ince&s;&s;ant howlings of the bea&s;ts of prey fill their minds with horror and di&s;|may. The needful comforts of life are no longer in their power&mdash;no friendly roof to &s;helter them from inclement &s;kies; no for|tre&s;s to protect them from &s;urrounding dangers. Unaccu&s;tomed as they were to hard&s;hips like the&s;e, &s;ome were cut off by &s;ickne&s;s and di&s;ea&s;e, and others &s;natched away by the hands of barbarity. They be|gan however, with great per&s;everance, to clear the land of encumbering rubbi&s;h, and the woods re&s;ound with the &s;trokes of la|bour; they drain the waters from the &s;edged mora&s;s, and pour the &s;un beams on the reek|ing &s;oil; they are forced to exerci&s;e all the powers of indu&s;try and oeconomy for bare &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and like their fir&s;t parent, when driven from Paradi&s;e, to earn their bread with the &s;weat of their brows. In this work they were frequently interrupted by the in|cur&s;ions of the wild bea&s;ts, again&s;t whom they defended them&s;elves with heroic prow|e&s;s and magnanimity.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="013339_0011_0F90553160990050">AFTER &s;ometime, however, by dint of indefatigable per&s;everance, they found them|&s;elves comfortably &s;ettled in this new farm; and had the delightful pro&s;pect of va&s;t tracts of land waving with luxuriant harve&s;ts, and perfuming the air with delicious fruits, which before had been a dreary wilderne&s;s, unfit for the habitation of men.</P>
<P>IN the mean time they kept up a con&s;tant corre&s;pondence with their father's family, and at a great expence provided waggons, hor&s;es and drivers to bring from his &s;hop &s;uch goods and merchandize as they wanted, for which they paid out of the produce of their lands.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<P>NOW the new &s;ettlers had adopted a mode of government in their &s;everal families &s;imilar to that their father had e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in the old farm; in taking a new wife at the end of certain periods of time; which wife was cho&s;en for them by their children, and without who&s;e con&s;ent they could do nothing material in the conduct of their affairs. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances they thrived exceedingly, and became very numerous; living in great harmony among&s;t
<PB N="13" REF="013339_0012_0F905532813E92B0">
them&s;elves, and in con&s;titutional obedience to their father and his wife.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING their &s;ucce&s;sful pro|gre&s;s, however, they were frequently annoy|ed by the wild bea&s;ts, which were not yet expelled the country; and were moreover troubled by &s;ome of their neighbours who wanted to drive them off the land, and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it them&s;elves.</P>
<P>TO a&s;&s;i&s;t them in the&s;e difficulties, and protect them from danger, the old Noble|man &s;ent over &s;everal of his &s;ervants, who with the help of the new &s;ettlers drove away their enemies. But then he required that they &s;hould reimbur&s;e him for the expence and trouble he was at in their behalf; this they did with great chearfulne&s;s, by applying from time to time to their re&s;pective wives, who always commanded their ca&s;h.</P>
<P>THUS did matters go on for a con&s;iderable time, to their mutual happine&s;s and benefit. But now the Nobleman's wife began to ca&s;t an avaricious eye upon the new &s;ettlers; &s;aying to her&s;elf, if by the natural con&s;e|quence of their intercour&s;e with us my wealth and power are &s;o much increa&s;ed, how much more would they accumulate if I can per&s;uade them that all they have be|longed
<PB N="14" REF="013339_0013_0F905533D0C716F8">
to us, and therefore I may at any time demand from them &s;uch part of their earnings as I plea&s;e. At the &s;ame time &s;he was fully &s;en&s;ible of the promi&s;es and agree|ments her hu&s;band had made when they left the old farm, and the tenor and purport of the <HI>great paper.</HI> She therefore thought it nece&s;&s;ary to proceed with great caution and art, and endeavoured to gain her point by imperceptible &s;teps.</P>
<P>IN order to this, &s;he fir&s;t i&s;&s;ued an edict &s;etting forth, That whereas the tailors of her family were greatly injured by the people of the new farm, ina&s;much as they pre&s;u|med to make their own clothes whereby the &s;aid tailors were deprived of the benefit of their cu&s;tom; it was therefore ordained that for the future the new &s;ettlers &s;hould not be permitted to have among&s;t them any &s;hears or &s;ci&s;&s;ars larger than a certain fixed &s;ize. In con&s;equence of this, our adven|turers were compelled to have their clothes made by their father's tailors: But out of regard to the old gentleman, they patiently &s;ubmitted to this grievance.</P>
<P>ENCOURAGED by this &s;ucce&s;s, &s;he pro|ceeded in her plan. Ob&s;erving that the new &s;ettlers, were very fond of a particular kind of cyder which they purcha&s;ed of a
<PB N="15" REF="013339_0014_0F9055345A52C8E8">
neighbour who was in friendi&s;hp with their father (the apples proper for making this cyder not growing on their own farm) &s;he publi&s;hed another edict, obliging them to pay her a certain &s;tipend for every barrel of cyder u&s;ed in their families! To this like|wi&s;e they &s;ubmitted: Not yet &s;eeing the &s;cope of her de&s;igns again&s;t them.</P>
<P>AFTER this manner &s;he proceeded, im|po&s;ing taxes on them on various pretences, and receiving the fruits of their indu&s;try with both hands. Moreover &s;he per&s;uaded her hu&s;band to &s;end among&s;t them from time to time a number of the mo&s;t lazy and u&s;ele&s;s of his &s;ervants, under the &s;pecious, pretext of defending them in their &s;ettlements and of a&s;&s;i&s;ting to de&s;troy the wild bea&s;ts; but in fact to rid his own hou&s;e of their com|pany, not having employment for them; and at the &s;ame time to be a watch and a check upon the people of the new farm.</P>
<P>IT was likewi&s;e ordered that the&s;e pro|tectors as they were called, &s;hould be &s;up|plied with bread and butter cut in a parti|cular form: But the head of one of the fa|milies refu&s;ed to comply with this order. He engaged to give the gue&s;ts, thus forced upon him, bread and butter &s;ufficient; but in&s;i&s;ted that his wife &s;hould have the liberty of cutting it in what &s;hape &s;he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="013339_0015_0F90553745F51DB0">THIS put the old Nobleman into a vio|lent pa&s;&s;ion, in&s;omuch that he had his &s;on's wife put into gaol for pre&s;uming to cut her loaf otherwi&s;e than as had been directed.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<P>AS the old Gentleman advanced in years he began to neglect the affairs of his family, leaving them chiefly to the management of his &s;teward. Now the &s;teward had debauched his wife, and by that means gained an entire a&s;cendancy over her. She no longer deliberated what would mo&s;t benefit either the old farm or the new; but &s;aid and did whatever the &s;teward plea&s;ed. Nay &s;o much was &s;he in|fluenced by him that &s;he could neither utter <HI>Ay</HI> or <HI>No</HI> but as he directed. For he had cunningly per&s;uaded her that it was very fa&s;hionable for women to wear padlocks on their lips, and that he was &s;ure they would become her exceedingly. He therefore fa&s;t|ened a padlock to each corner of her mouth; when the one was open, &s;he could only &s;ay <HI>Ay</HI>; and when the other was loo&s;ed, could only cry <HI>No.</HI> He took care to keep the keys of the&s;e locks him&s;elf; &s;o that her will became entirely &s;ubject to his power.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="013339_0016_0F90553761D34D40">NOW the old Lady and the &s;teward had &s;et them&s;elves again&s;t the people of the new farm; and began to devi&s;e ways and means to impoveri&s;h and di&s;tre&s;s them.</P>
<P>THEY prevailed on the Nobleman to &s;ign an edict again&s;t the new &s;ettlers, in which it was declared that it was their duty as children to pay &s;omething towards the &s;up|plying their fathers table with provi&s;ions, and to the &s;upporting the dignity of his fa|mily; for that purpo&s;e it was ordained that all their &s;poons, knives and forks, plates and porringers, &s;hould be marked with a certain mark, by officers appointed for that end; for which marking they were to pay a cer|tain &s;tipend: and that they &s;hould not, un|der &s;evere penalties, pre&s;ume to make u&s;e of any &s;poon, knife or fork, plate or porringer, before it had been &s;o marked, and the &s;aid &s;tipend paid to the officer.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants of the new farm began to &s;ee that their father's affections were alie|nated from them; and that their mother was but a ba&s;e mother-in-law debauched by their enemy the &s;teward. They were thrown into great confu&s;ion and di&s;tre&s;s. They wrote the mo&s;t &s;upplicating letters to the old Gentleman, in which they acknow|ledged him to be their father in terms of the
<PB N="18" REF="013339_0017_0F90553911612C48">
greate&s;t re&s;pect and affection&mdash;they recount|ed to him the hard&s;hips and dfficulties they had &s;uffered in &s;ettling his new farm; and pointed out the great addition of wealth and power his family had acquired by the im|provement of that wilderne&s;s; and &s;hewed him that all the fruits of their labours mu&s;t in the natural cour&s;e of things unite, in the long run, in his money box. They al&s;o, in humble terms reminded him of his pro|mi&s;es and engagements on their leaving home, and of the bonds he had given them; of the &s;olemnity and importance of the <HI>Great Paper</HI> with the cur&s;e annexed. They acknowledged that he ought to be reimbur&s;|ed the expences he was at on their account, and that it was their duty to a&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;upport|ing the dignity of his family. All this they declared they were ready and willing to do; but reque&s;ted that they might do it agreea|ble to the purport of the <HI>Great Paper,</HI> by ap|plying to their &s;everal wives for the keys of their money boxes and furni&s;hing him from thence; and not to be &s;ubject to the tyran|ny and caprice of an avaricious mother-in-law, whom they had never cho&s;en, and of a &s;teward who was their declared enemy.</P>
<P>SOME of the&s;e letters were intercepted by the &s;teward; others were delivered to the old Gentleman, who was at the &s;ame time
<PB N="19" REF="013339_0018_0F905539A1EB9800">
per&s;uaded to take no notice of them; but, on the contrary, to in&s;i&s;t the more &s;trenu|ou&s;ly upon the right his wife claimed of marking their &s;poons, knives and forks, plates and porringers.</P>
<P>THE new &s;ettlers ob&s;erving how matters were conducted in their father's family be|came exceedingly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and mortified. They met together and agreed one and all that they would no longer &s;ubmit to the ar|bitrary impo&s;itions of their mother-in-law, and their enemy the &s;teward. They deter|mined to pay no manner of regard to the new decree, con&s;idering it as a violation of the <HI>Great Paper.</HI> But to go on and eat their broth and pudding as u&s;ual. The cooks al&s;o and butlers &s;erved up their &s;poons, knives and forks, plates and porrin|gers without having them marked by the new officers.</P>
<P>THE Nobleman at length thought fit to rever&s;e the order which had been made re|&s;pecting the &s;poons, knives and forks, plates and porringers of the new &s;ettlers. But he did this with a very ill grace: for he, at the &s;ame time avowed and declared that he and his wife had a right to mark all their furniture, if they plea&s;ed, from the &s;ilver tankard down to the very chamber pots: that as he was their father he had an ab&s;o|lute
<PB N="20" REF="013339_0019_0F90553A5D718578">
controul over them, and that their li|berties, lives, and properties were at the en|tire di&s;po&s;al of him and his wife: that it was not fit that he who was allowed to be <HI>omni|pre&s;ent, immortal,</HI> and <HI>incapable of error,</HI> &s;hould be confined by the &s;hackles of the <HI>Great Paper</HI>; or obliged to fulfil the bonds he had given them, which he averred he had a right to cancel whenever he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>HIS wife al&s;o became intoxicated with vanity. The &s;teward had told her that &s;he was an <HI>omnipotent</HI> Godde&s;s, and ought to be wor&s;hipped as &s;uch: that it was the height of impudence and di&s;obedience in the new &s;ettlers to di&s;pute her authority, which with re&s;pect to them, was unlimited: that as they had removed from their father's family, they had forfeited all preten&s;ions of being con&s;i|dered as his children, and lo&s;t the privileges of the <HI>Great Paper</HI>: that, therefore, &s;he might look on them only as tenants at will upon her hu&s;band's farm, and exact from them what rent &s;he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>ALL this was perfectly agreeable to Ma|dam, who admitted this new doctrine in its full &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>THE people of the new farm however took little notice of the&s;e pompous declara|tions.
<PB N="21" REF="013339_0020_0F90553B1DF3D4D8">
They were glad the marking decree was rever&s;ed, and were in hopes that things would gradually &s;ettle into their former channel.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<P>IN the mean time the new &s;ettlers increa&s;ed exceedingly, and as they increa&s;ed, their dealings at their father's &s;hop were propor|tionably enlarged.</P>
<P>IT is true they &s;uffered &s;ome inconvenien|cies from the protectors that had been &s;ent among&s;t them, who became very trouble|&s;ome in their hou&s;es: They &s;educed their daughters; introduced riot and intemperance into their families, and derided and in&s;ulted the orders and regulations they had made for their own good government. Moreover the old Nobleman had &s;ent among&s;t them a great number of thieves, ravi&s;hers and murderers, who did a great deal of mi&s;chief by practi&s;ing tho&s;e crimes for which they had been bani&s;hed the old farm. But they bore the&s;e grievances with as much patience as could be expected; not cho&s;ing to trou|ble their aged father with complaints, unle&s;s in ca&s;es of important nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="013339_0021_0F90553BF05371D8">NOW the &s;teward continued to hate the new &s;ettlers with exceeding great hatred, and determined to renew his attack upon their peace and happine&s;s. He artfully in|&s;inuated to the old Gentleman and his fool|i&s;h wife, that it was very mean and unbe|coming in them to receive the contributi|ons of the people of the new farm, towards &s;upporting the dignity of his family, through the hands of their re&s;pective wives: that upon this footing it would be in their pow|er to refu&s;e his requi&s;itions whenever they &s;hould be thought to be unrea&s;onable, of which they would pretend to be judges them&s;elves; and that it was high time they &s;hould be compelled to acknowledge his ar|bitrary power, and his wife's <HI>Omnipotence.</HI></P>
<P>FOR this purpo&s;e, another decree was prepared and publi&s;hed, ordering that the new &s;ettlers &s;hould pay a certain &s;tipend up|on particular goods, which they were not allowed to purcha&s;e any where but at their father's &s;hop; and that this &s;tipend &s;hould not be deemed an advance upon the original price of the goods, but be paid on their ar|rival at the new farm, for the expre&s;s pur|po&s;e of &s;upporting the dignity of the old Gentleman's family, and of defraying the expences he affected to afford them.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="013339_0022_0F90553D5E479258">THIS new decree gave our adventurers the utmo&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s. They &s;aw that the &s;teward and their mother-in-law were de|termined to oppre&s;s and en&s;lave them. They again met together and wrote to their fa|ther, as before, the mo&s;t humble and per|&s;ua&s;ive letters; but to little purpo&s;e: A deaf ear was turned to all their remon&s;tran|ces; and their dutiful reque&s;ts treated with contempt.</P>
<P>FINDING this moderate and decent con|duct brought them no relief, they had re|cour&s;e to another expedient. They bound them&s;elves in a &s;olemn engagement not to deal any more at their father's &s;hop until this uncon&s;titutional decree &s;hould be re|ver&s;ed; which they declared to be a viola|tion of the <HI>Great Paper.</HI></P>
<P>THIS agreement was &s;o &s;trictly adhered to, that in a few months the clerks and ap|prentices in the old Gentleman's &s;hop began to make a &s;ad outcry. They declared that their ma&s;ter's trade was declining exceed|ingly, and that his wife and &s;teward would, by their mi&s;chievious machinations, ruin the whole farm; they forthwith &s;harpened their pens and attacked the &s;teward, and even the old Lady her&s;elf with great &s;everity. In&s;o|much that it was thought proper to with|draw
<PB N="24" REF="013339_0023_0F90553D811D1090">
this attempt likewi&s;e upon the rights and liberties of the new &s;ettlers. One part only of the new decree remained unrever&s;|ed&mdash;viz. the tax upon <HI>Water Gruel.</HI></P>
<P>NOW there were certain men on the old farm who had obtained from the Nobleman an exclu&s;ive right of &s;elling <HI>Water Gruel.</HI> Va&s;t quantities of this <HI>Gruel</HI> were vended among&s;t the new &s;ettlers; for it became very fa&s;hionable for them to u&s;e it in their families in great abundance. They did not however trouble them&s;elves much about the tax on <HI>Water Gruel</HI>: they were well plea&s;|ed with the rever&s;al of the other parts of the decree, and con&s;idering <HI>Gruel</HI> as not ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary to the comfort of life, they were determined to endeavour to do without it, and by that means avoid the remaining effects of the new decree.</P>
<P>THE &s;teward found his de&s;igns once more fru&s;trated; but was not di&s;couraged by this di&s;appointment. He formed ano|ther &s;cheme &s;o artfully contrived that he thought him&s;elf &s;ure of &s;ucce&s;s. He &s;ent for the per&s;ons who had the &s;ole right of vending <HI>Water Gruel,</HI> and after reminding them of the obligations they were under to the Nobleman and his wife for their ex|clu&s;ive privilege, he de&s;ired that they would
<PB N="25" REF="013339_0024_0F90553E1A61FF70">
&s;end &s;undry waggon loads of <HI>Gruel</HI> to the new farm, promi&s;ing that the accu&s;tomed duty which they paid for their exclu&s;ive right &s;hould be taken off from all the <HI>Gruel</HI> they &s;hould &s;end among&s;t the new &s;ettlers: And that in ca&s;e their cargoes &s;hould come to any damage, he would take care that the lo&s;s &s;hould be repaired out of the old Gentleman's coffers.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Gruel</HI> merchants readily con&s;ented to this propo&s;al, knowing that if their car|goes were &s;old, they would reap con&s;idera|ble profits; and if they failed, the &s;teward was to make good the damage. On the other hand the &s;teward concluded that the new &s;ettlers could not re&s;i&s;t purcha&s;ing the <HI>Gruel</HI> to which they had been &s;o long ac|cu&s;tomed; and if they did purcha&s;e it when &s;ubject to the tax afore&s;aid, this would be an avowed acknowledgment on their parts that their father and his wife had a right to break through the tenor of the <HI>Great Paper,</HI> and to lay on them what impo&s;itions they plea&s;ed, without the con&s;ent of their re&s;pective wives.</P>
<P>BUT the new &s;ettlers were well aware of this decoy. They &s;aw clearly that the <HI>Gruel</HI> was not &s;ent to accommodate, but to en&s;lave them; and that if they &s;uffered any
<PB N="26" REF="013339_0025_0F9055409938B5F8">
part of it to be &s;old among&s;t them, it would be deemed a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the a&s;&s;umed <HI>Om|nipotence</HI> of the <HI>Great Madam.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<P>ON the arrival of the <HI>Water Gruel,</HI> the people of the new farm were again thrown into great alarms and confu&s;ions. Some of them would not &s;uffer the waggons to be unloaded at all, but &s;ent them imme|diately back to the <HI>Gruel</HI> merchants: others permitted the waggons to unload, but would not touch the hateful commodity; &s;o that it lay neglected about their roads and high|ways until it grew &s;our and &s;poiled. But one of the new &s;ettlers, who&s;e name was <HI>Jack,</HI> either from a keener &s;en&s;e of the inju|ries attempted again&s;t him, or from the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of his &s;ituation, which was &s;uch that he could not &s;end back the <HI>Gruel</HI> be|cau&s;e of a number of mercenaries whom his father had &s;tationed before his hou&s;e to watch and be a check upon his conduct: he, I &s;ay, being almo&s;t driven to di&s;pair, fell to work, and with great zeal &s;tove to pieces the ca&s;ks of <HI>Gruel,</HI> which had been &s;ent him, and ut|terly demoli&s;hed the whole cargoe.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="013339_0026_0F905541D4C98C68">THESE proceedings were &s;oon known at the old farm. Great and terrible was the uproar there. The old Gentleman fell in|to great wrath, declaring that his ab&s;ent children meant to throw off all dependence upon him, and to become altogether di&s;o|bedient. His wife al&s;o tore the padlocks from her lips, and raved and &s;tormed like a Billin&s;gate. The &s;teward lo&s;t all patience and moderation, &s;wearing mo&s;t prophanely that he would leave no &s;tone unturned 'till he had <HI>humbled the &s;ettlers of the new farm at his feet,</HI> and cau&s;ed their father to trample on their necks. Moreover the <HI>Gruel</HI> mer|chants roared and bellowed for the lo&s;s of their <HI>Gruel</HI>; and the clerks and apprentices were in the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation le&s;t the people of the new farm &s;hould again agree to have no dealings with their father's &s;hop. &mdash;Vengeance was immediately &s;et on foot particularly again&s;t <HI>Jack.</HI> With him they determined to begin; hoping that by mak|ing an example of him they &s;hould &s;o terri|fy the other families of the new &s;ettlers, that they would all &s;ubmit to the de&s;igns of the &s;teward, and the <HI>Omnipotence</HI> of the old Lady.</P>
<P>A VERY large <HI>Padlock</HI> was, accordingly, prepared to be fa&s;tened upon <HI>Jack's</HI> great gate; the key of which was to be given to
<PB N="28" REF="013339_0027_0F905541F078B4E8">
the old Gentleman; who was not to open it again until he had paid for the <HI>Gruel</HI> he had &s;pilt, and re&s;igned all claim to the privi|leges of the <HI>Great Paper</HI>: nor then neither unle&s;s he thought fit. Secondly, a decree was made to new model the regulations and oeconomy of <HI>Jack's</HI> family in &s;uch man|ner that they might for the future be more &s;ubject to the will of the &s;teward: and, thirdly, a large gallows was erected before the man&s;ion hou&s;e in the old farm, and an order made that if any of <HI>Jack's</HI> children or &s;ervants &s;hould be &s;u&s;pected of mi&s;behaviour, they &s;hould not be convicted or acquitted by the con&s;ent of their brethren, agreeable to the purport of the <HI>Great Paper,</HI> but be tied neck and heels and dragged to the gallows at the man&s;ion hou&s;e, and there be hanged withot mercy.</P>
<P>NO &s;ooner did tidings of this undue &s;eve|rity reach the new farm, but the people were almo&s;t ready to di&s;pair. They were altogether at a lo&s;s how to act, or by what means they &s;hould avert the vengeance to which they were doomed: but the old La|dy and &s;teward &s;oon determined the matter&punc; for the <HI>Padlock</HI> was &s;ent over, and without ceremony fa&s;tened upon <HI>Jack</HI>'s great gate. They did not wait to know whether he would pay for the <HI>Gruel</HI> or not, or make the requir|ed
<PB N="29" REF="013339_0028_0F905542A49BE320">
acknowledgments; nor give him the lea&s;t opportunity to make his defence&mdash; The great gate was locked, and the key given to the old Nobleman, as had been determined.</P>
<P>POOR <HI>Jack</HI> found him&s;elf in a mo&s;t de|plorable condition. The great inlet to his farm was entirely blocked up, &s;o that he could neither carry out the produce of his land for &s;ale, nor receive from abroad the nece&s;&s;aries for his family.</P>
<P>BUT this was not all&mdash;His father, along with the <HI>Padlock</HI> afore&s;aid, had &s;ent an over|&s;eer to hector and domineer over him and his family; and to endeavour to break his &s;pirit by exerci&s;ing every po&s;&s;ible &s;everity: for which purpo&s;e he was attended by a great number of mercenaries, and armed with more than common authorities.</P>
<P>ON his fir&s;t arrival in <HI>Jack</HI>'s family he was received with con&s;iderable re&s;pect, be|cau&s;e he was the delegate of their aged fa|ther: for, notwith&s;tanding all that had pa&s;t, the people of the new &s;ettlements loved and revered the old Gentleman with a truly fi|lial attachment: attributing his unkindne&s;s entirely to the intrigues of their enemy the &s;teward. But this fair weather did not la&s;t
<PB N="30" REF="013339_0029_0F9055437358CA68">
long. The new over&s;eer took the fir&s;t op|portunity of &s;hewing that he had no inten|tions of living in harmony and friend&s;hip with the family. Some of <HI>Jack</HI>'s dome&s;|ticks had put on their Sunday clothes, and attended the over&s;eer in the great parlour, in order to pay him their compliments on his arrival, and to reque&s;t his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in reconciling them to their father: but he rudely &s;topped them &s;hort in the mid&s;t of their &s;peech; called them a parcel of di&s;obe|dient &s;coundrels, and bid them go about their bu&s;ine&s;s. So &s;aying, he turned upon his heel, and with great contempt left the room.</P>

<P>NOW <HI>Jack</HI> and his family finding them&s;elves oppre&s;&s;ed, in&s;ulted, and tyranni&s;ed over in the mo&s;t cruel and arbi|trary manner, advi&s;ed with their brethren what mea&s;ures &s;hould be adopted to relieve them from their intolerable grievances. Their brethren, one and all, united in &s;ym|pathi&s;ing with their afflictions; they advi&s;|ed them to bear their &s;ufferings with forti|tude for a time, a&s;&s;uring them that they looked on the puni&s;hments and in&s;ults laid

upon them with the &s;ame indignation as if they had been inflicted on them&s;elves, and that they would &s;tand by and &s;upport them to the la&s;t. But, above all, earne&s;tly recom|mended it to them to be firm and &s;teady in the cau&s;e of liberty and ju&s;tice, and never ac|knowledge the <HI>Omnipotence</HI> of their mother-in-law; nor yield to the machinations of their enemy the &s;teward.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, le&s;t <HI>Jack</HI>'s family &s;hould &s;uffer for want of nece&s;&s;aries, their great gate being fa&s;t locked, liberal and very generous contributions were rai&s;ed among the &s;everal families of the new &s;ettlements for their pre|&s;ent relief. This &s;ea&s;onable bounty was handed to <HI>Jack</HI> over the garden wall&mdash;all ac|ce&s;s to the front of his hou&s;e being &s;hut up.</P>
<P>NOW the over&s;eer ob&s;erved that the chil|dren and dome&s;ticks of <HI>Jack</HI>'s family had frequent meetings and con&s;ultations toge|ther; &s;ometimes in the garret, and &s;ome|times in the &s;table: under&s;tanding, like|wi&s;e, that an agreement not to deal in their father's &s;hop, until their grievances &s;hould be redre&s;&s;ed, was much talked of among&s;t them, he wrote a thundering prohibition, much like a Pope's Bull, which he cau&s;ed to be pa&s;ted up in every room of the hou&s;e: in which he declared and prote&s;ted that the&s;e

meetings were trea&s;onable, traiterous, and rebellious; contrary to the dignity of their father, and incon&s;i&s;tent with the <HI>Omnipo|tence</HI> of their mother-in-law: denouncing al&s;o terrible puni&s;hments again&s;t any two of the family who &s;hould from thenceforth be &s;een whi&s;pering together, and &s;trictly forbidding the dome&s;ticks to hold any more meetings in the garret or &s;table.</P>
