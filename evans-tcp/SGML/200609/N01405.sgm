<HEAD>On the much Lamented DEATH of the Reverend Mr. Noadiah Russel, Late Pastor of the Church of CHRIST in Middletown, who had his Clayey Tabernacle Dissolved and his Mortality Swallowed up of Life, December 3d. 1713. Aetatis Suae, 55.</HEAD>
<L>DID <HI>Isr'el</HI> Mourn when holy <HI>Sam'el</HI> dy'd?</L>
<L>Or when, they of their <HI>Aron</HI> were depriv'd?</L>
<L>When <HI>Saul</HI> was slain, and when, great <HI>Abner</HI> fell</L>
<L>A hearty grief that Monarchs Tears did tell.</L>
<L><HI>Elisha</HI> dying, Wicked <HI>Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"></HI> Cry's,</L>
<L>Whom once <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Slighted now to late does Prize</L>
<L>Both <HI>Isr'els</HI> Sons and the <HI>Egyptians</HI> Fierce</L>
<L>With Ecchoing Moans did follow <HI>Jacobs</HI> Hearse.</L>
<L>And shall sweet RUSSEL unlamented Die?</L>
<L>Twould speak we're Sick of deepest Apathy;</L>
<L>Ay! worse than Brutes, more Stupid far away</L>
<L>Who howl &amp; moan when Mates become a Prey.</L>
<L>Let cease our Joy, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ables only wear,</L>
<L>Let nought but Sighs of dismal Grief appear.</L>
<L>Come all his Flock, his Houshold Brethren too,</L>
<L>Ye Priests of GOD Enfeebled by this Blow.</L>
<L>Oh come from ev'ry Place, come Join in One</L>
<L>Our Grief conjoin'd, will make the louder Moan</L>
<L>Forbear a Smile, let Tears stand in all Eyes</L>
<L>Come wet his Grave, and fill the Air with Cryes</L>
<L>In broken, sobbing Notes, let us set forth,</L>
<L>Our Heavy, Heavy Loss, his Golden worth.</L>
<L>The Task's too Great and far out bids my Skill</L>
<L>I fear t'eclipse in shewing my good will;</L>
<L>His Shining Merit, and to wound his Name</L>
<L>Mounted long since, on spreading Wings of Fame.</L>
<L>His Name is Precious and his Memory,</L>
<L>Perfum'd shall last, unto Eternity.</L>
<L>His small Remains lock'd-up, unmade must be</L>
<L>But rise e're long, and Glorious stand, you'l see.</L>
<L>Belov'd of all but slighters of whats rare.</L>
<L>Vertue's a Crime, with such as haters were.</L>
<L>Not without woes, but from base Vices free,</L>
<L>In World Corrupt, untouch'd, untainted he:</L>
<L>Like healthy Body's in Contagious air</L>
<L>Or Fish that fresh, whose livings in salt <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> are.</L>
<L>His Vertue's rare, in this our Cloudy Night,</L>
<L>As Stars, in azure Sky, they shin'd most bright</L>
<L>Methinks as <HI>A'ron,</HI> in his Sacred Dress,</L>
<L>So RUSSEL's Soul adorn'd with Grace no less.</L>
<L>His Speech was sweet, &amp; Aspect well might win,</L>
<L>But greater, Richer Beauty, lay within.</L>
<L>His Head with Learning, Prudence, Holy Art,</L>
<L>Firm Faith &amp; Love, Humility his Heart,</L>
<L>Peaceful &amp; Meek, but yet, with Courage Stout,</L>
<L>Engag'd the Fiend, and did him sorely Rout.</L>
<L>From <HI>David'</HI>s Tow'r with Armour bright supply'd</L>
<L>Both Shield &amp; Sword, Helmet &amp; Brestplate wide</L>
<L>Th envenom'd Darts, he bravely did Repel,</L>
<L>With full strength shot, from Fury's fierce of Hell.</L>
<L>To needless strife a Foe, yet ready Stood,</L>
<L>To spend for <HI>Christ,</HI> his <HI>Name</HI> his <HI>Strength</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Blood,</L>
<L>Lightned by <HI>CHRIST,</HI> a fixed shining Star.</L>
<L>Keeping strait course, gave <HI>warmth</HI> &amp; <HI>guidance rare</HI></L>
<L>A Pregnant Cloud &amp; Fruitful Showers Yielding,</L>
<L>Softening Hearts most Hard; &amp; yet most Cooling</L>
<L>To Conscience Scorched, with <HI>Gods</HI> dismal wrath,</L>
<L>Producing hope, of what is somewhat worth.</L>
<L>Skill'd was he in his work &amp; Painful too,</L>
<L>Souls to beget &amp; then to make them grow.</L>
<L>Oh! with what skill did he GOD's Word divide;</L>
<L>'Twas first unvail'd &amp; then with warmth apply'd</L>
<L>He dealt to each with care his Portion due,</L>
<L>Dread Woes to some to others Comforts new.</L>
<L>Unto <HI>Christ's</HI> Lambs he was a tender Nurse</L>
<L>But smartly Scourg'd all such as still grew worse</L>
<L>He <HI>Preach'd,</HI> he <HI>Pray'd,</HI> he <HI>Watch'd,</HI> he <HI>Wept,</HI> &amp; why?</L>
<L>His Love to <HI>Christ,</HI> and fears lest Souls would dy.</L>
<L>But we're depriv'd &amp; now too soon we see</L>
<L>His greater Worth, Augments our Misery.</L>
<L>Our swelling Joys are ebb'd &amp; now we stand</L>
<L>Parch'd like the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> as the day <HI>Africk</HI> sand.</L>
<L>Methinks as when the hasty setting Sun,</L>
<L>Makes glad the <HI>East</HI> it leaves the <HI>West</HI> Undone,</L>
<L>So, Joy'd were Saints above, when he came in,</L>
<L>But left are we, midst Woes, Darkness &amp; Sin.</L>
<L>Oh <HI>Ra<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">els</HI> dead (blest Saint) thus we're undone,</L>
<L>Our town is fallen and our Beauty<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">s gone.</L>
<L>We <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> lost our <HI>Pastor</HI> &amp; our <HI>Patron</HI> dear,</L>
<L>Our strongest <HI>Chariots</HI> &amp; our <HI>Horsemen</HI> rare:</L>
<L>Our Feet will wander &amp; our Souls must starve,</L>
<L>There's none to <HI>guide,</HI> nor <HI>Bread</HI> when as we crave,</L>
<L>That can it break, tho' once we had good fare</L>
<L>Of Bread most fat, &amp; Dainty's that were rare</L>
<L>Surpriz'd with Ill, no <HI>Watchman</HI> to descry,</L>
<L><HI>Gods</HI> Angel great &amp; Judgments when they're nigh.</L>
<L>Now <HI>Hell</HI> will shout, &amp; <HI>Sinners</HI> will grow bold</L>
<L>Young Seekers faint &amp; Saints themselves wax cold.</L>
<L>The <HI>Wall</HI> is broke, &amp; now the <HI>Cursed</HI> Foe</L>
<L>Of Souls, more fierce &amp; sedulous will grow</L>
<L>With doubled force &amp; more his Game anew</L>
<L>Our Leader' dead, unwearied will pursue.</L>
<L>Mourn do our <HI>Zions ways,</HI> our Lord's-days sad,</L>
<L>Gods sacred House where frequent we have had</L>
<L>Our Souls, refresh'd &amp; fill'd with Joy that's true,</L>
<L>There are we sad &amp; sinking griefs renew.</L>
<L>Thus into darkness, I am bro't, &amp; left,</L>
<L>I'm Naked made, of Treasure rich bereft,</L>
<L>In Ashes roll'd with bitterness I'm fill'd</L>
<L>I'm plung'd i'th' deep, yet tis what he has will'd.</L>
<L>Shew me the Sin that yields such smart as this,</L>
<L>Oh make me grieve for what's in me amiss</L>
<L>Lord pity me, &amp; stanch my Bleeding Wound</L>
<L>Repair my Loss, Oh! make me Whole &amp; Sound.</L>

<L>When they will off those Vermins shake</L>
<L>And in a new and bright Array,</L>
