<HEAD>ELEGY, On the DEATH of MR. BUCKINGHAM ST. JOHN, TUTOR of YALE COLLEGE, who was drowned in his Pa&s;&s;age from <HI>New-Haven</HI> to <HI>Norwalk,</HI>
<DATE><HI>May</HI> the 5th, 1771.</DATE></HEAD>
<L>THE world now yields to night's returning &s;way;</L>
<L>The deeper glooms lead on the &s;olemn hour,</L>
<L>And call my &s;teps, beneath the moon's pale ray,</L>
<L>To roam in &s;adne&s;s on the &s;ea-beat &s;hore.</L>
<L>Now glide the uncon&s;tant &s;hadows o'er the plain,</L>
<L>The broad moon &s;wimming thro' the broken clouds,</L>
<L>The gleam of waters brightens on the main,</L>
<L>And anchor'd navies lift their waving &s;hrouds.</L>
<L>Deep &s;ilence reigns, &s;ave on the moory ground,</L>
<L>The long reed ru&s;tling to the pa&s;&s;ing gales,</L>
<L>The noi&s;e of da&s;hing waves, and hollow &s;ound</L>
<L>Of ru&s;hing winds that murmur thro' the &s;ails.</L>
<L>Far hence, ye plea&s;ures of a mind at ea&s;e,</L>
<L>The &s;prightly joys that rural &s;cenes can yield,</L>
<L>When &s;pring, led jocund by the &s;oft'ning breeze</L>
<L>Wakes the glad morn and robes the dewy field.</L>
<L>Far be the giddy raptures of the gay,</L>
<L>The midnight joys licentious youth can &s;hare,</L>
<L>While Ruin, &s;miling o'er her de&s;tin'd prey,</L>
<L>In &s;weet allurements hides her deadly &s;nare.</L>
<L>Mine be the mu&s;ic of the rolling wave,</L>
<L>The moonlight &s;hadows and &s;urrounding gloom,</L>
<L>Mine the dread haunts of Contemplation grave,</L>
<L>That lift the &s;oul to &s;cenes beyond the tomb.</L>
<L>Here while deep midnight hold her &s;ilent reign,</L>
<L>And fancy bears the ravi&s;h'd thought along,</L>
<L>Dark Melancholy &s;preads her airy train,</L>
<L>And Friend&s;hip calls and Grief in&s;pires the &s;ong.</L>
<L>As thro' the&s;e mournful glooms I &s;tretch my &s;ight,</L>
<L>Mid &s;ounds of death that bid the &s;oul attend,</L>
<L>Mid empty forms and fleeting &s;hapes of night,</L>
<L>Slowly I view a whiterobed &s;hade a&s;cend.</L>
<L>That &s;ays, "I once was St. John! from the bounds</L>
<L>Of unknown realms beneath the dreary wave,</L>
<L>Where ever-re&s;tle&s;s floods in nightly rounds,</L>
<L>Roll their dark &s;urges o'er my watry grave.</L>
<L>From &s;eats which, near to mortal &s;ight di&s;play'd,</L>
<L>The gates of va&s;t eternity &s;urround,</L>
<L>In night conceal'd and death's impervious &s;hade,</L>
<L>My voice a&s;cends! attend the warning &s;ound.</L>
<L>Oh, thou attend! who flu&s;h'd with early bloom,</L>
<L>In life's new &s;pring and vernal &s;weetne&s;s gay,</L>
<L>Mindle&s;s of fate, that mu&s;t thy branch entomb,</L>
<L>Spread'&s;t thy green blo&s;&s;oms to the morning ray.</L>
<L>With thee how late, how like alas, to thee,</L>
<L>To mortal joys by opening youth beguil'd,</L>
<L>I &s;tretch'd my airy wi&s;h, and follow'd free,</L>
<L>Where plea&s;ure triumph'd and where fancy &s;mil'd.</L>
<L>Then while fond Hope her glitt'ring pinions &s;pread,</L>
<L>Pointing to climes beyond the di&s;tant wave,</L>
<L>Ev'n then unnoticed o'er my de&s;tined head</L>
<L>Hung Death's dire form and &s;eal'd me for the grave.</L>
<L>How vain the thought for many a joyous morn,</L>
<L>To ta&s;te of raptures unallay'd by woe!</L>
<L>At once from life and every plea&s;ure torn,</L>
<L>From all I wi&s;h'd and all I loved below.</L>
<L>The faithle&s;s morning, on our opening &s;ails,</L>
<L>Smiled out &s;erene and &s;mooth'd our gliding way,</L>
<L>While the gay ve&s;&s;el, fann'd by breathing gales,</L>
<L>Play'd on the placid bo&s;om of the &s;ea.</L>
<L>When lo, de&s;cending on the dark'ning wind,</L>
<L>Bur&s;t the dire &s;torm&mdash;and feeble to &s;u&s;tain</L>
<L>The ru&s;hing bla&s;ts in warring fury join'd,</L>
<L>The frail &s;kiff &s;inks beneath the &s;urging main.</L>
<L>And &s;ee, afar the oarle&s;s boat conveys</L>
<L>The trembling &s;ailors to the di&s;tant &s;hore;</L>
<L>Alone, of aid bereft, with one la&s;t gaze,</L>
<L>I &s;unk in deeps and &s;unk to ri&s;e no more.</L>
<L>In that &s;ad hour, what fearful &s;cenes ari&s;e,</L>
<L>What pangs di&s;tre&s;s, what unknown fears di&s;may,</L>
<L>When future worlds di&s;clo&s;ing on our eyes,</L>
<L>The trembling &s;oul for&s;akes her kindred clay!</L>
<L>Before the awful bar, th' almighty throne,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> read, I've &s;tood th' Eternal Judge to &s;ee,</L>
<L>And fix'd in bli&s;s, or doom'd to endle&s;s moan,</L>
<L>Have heard the long, the unrevers'd decree:</L>
<L>Nor earth mu&s;t know the re&s;t"&mdash;Where art thou now,</L>
<L>In youthful joys my partner and my friend,</L>
<L>Of tho&s;e ble&s;t hours thy fortune gave below,</L>
<L>Of all our hopes is this the fatal end?</L>
<L>Oh what avail'd that energy of mind,</L>
<L>For di&s;tant realms of &s;cience to explore,</L>
<L>That early led where Genius unconfin'd</L>
<L>Spreads her glad fea&s;t and opes her cla&s;ic &s;tore?</L>
<L>Ah what avail'd, mid earthly hopes &s;o frail,</L>
<L>The &s;ame gay-dawning on thy ri&s;ing years?</L>
<L>Ah what avail'd (for what could then avail?)</L>
<L>Thy friend's deep &s;orrow, or thy country's tears?</L>
<L>In plea&s;ure's paths, where vivid fancy led,</L>
<L>Mid ev'ry hope that blooming worth could rai&s;e,</L>
<L>The wings of death, with fatal horror &s;pread,</L>
<L>Blank'd the bright promi&s;e of thy future days.</L>
<L>So from the lowring we&s;t the darkened clouds</L>
<L>Ru&s;h on the &s;un and dim his orient ray,</L>
<L>And hateful night in glooms untimely &s;hrouds</L>
<L>Th' a&s;cending glories of the vernal day.</L>
<L>Adieu, my friend, &s;o dear in vain, adieu,</L>
<L>Till &s;ome &s;hort days their fleeting cour&s;es roll,</L>
<L>Soon &s;hall our &s;teps thine earlier fate pur&s;ue,</L>
<L>Moved in the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ace and crowding to the goal.</L>
<L>Th' approaching hour &s;hall &s;ee the &s;un no more</L>
<L>Wheel his long cour&s;e, or &s;pread his golden ray;</L>
<L>Soon &s;hall the dream of mortal life be o'er,</L>
<L>The brightne&s;s dawning of cele&s;tial day.</L>
<L>Then join'd in bli&s;s, as once in friend&s;hip join'd,</L>
<L>May pitying heav'n our purer &s;pirits rai&s;e,</L>
<L>Each crime atoned, each virtue well refined,</L>
<L>To pa&s;s a ble&s;t eternity of prai&s;e.</L>
