<HEAD>The Turki&s;h Fa&s;t, Out of the Monthly Mercury, for <HI>December,</HI> 1697.</HEAD>
<P>THe 29 of the la&s;t Month, N. S. the new Aga of the Janizaries made his Publick Entry into <HI>Adrianople</HI>; but he had not above Ten or Twelve Captains of the Janizaries to at|tend him, all the re&s;t who were at the Battel of <HI>Zenta</HI> being kill'd, or &s;ince dead of their Wounds. The next day the Grand Signior arriv'd at the &s;ame City with his new prime Vi&s;ir; but he rode directly to his Seraglio without entring into the City, not de&s;iring they &s;hould make him any publick Reception, or that the Sultanne&s;s his Mother &s;hould meet him, as &s;he intended, two Miles out of the City. The ill Succe&s;s of the la&s;t Campagne has ca&s;t a deep Con|&s;ternation into all the Provinces of his Empire which have heard the ill Tidings, in&s;omuch that in &s;ome Places the People begin to murmur again&s;t the Grand Signior and his Government. For which Rea&s;on the Sultan has caus'd a General Fa&s;t, and Publick Prayers to be &s;aid throughout all his Dominions <HI>Alamode de Turqueske,</HI> which are to be accompany'd with Proce&s;&s;ions to <HI>Mecca,</HI> in hopes to appea&s;e the Anger of Heaven. To which purpo&s;e he has &s;et forth the following Ordinance, wherein are many things to be ob&s;erv'd relating to Mahometan Bigotry.</P>
<P>THe Grand Signor of the Turks acknowledging that the Hand of God lies heavy upon his Do|minions and his Subjects, for that they have &s;o often fought and been vanqui&s;h'd as well by Sea as by Land by their Enemies the Chri&s;tians, who have al&s;o in a little time regain'd from 'em a large Extent of their Country, attributes the&s;e frequent Misfortunes to the too great Confidence he has had in his Strength and his Alliances again&s;t the Emperor of the Chri&s;tians For which Rea&s;on he Or|dains and Commands, by the&s;e Pre&s;ents, for the attoning the Wrath of God, and his great Prophet <HI>Mahomet,</HI> That every <HI>Friday</HI> of the New Moon, as al&s;o upon the 5th. 6th. and 7th. of the Month, that all Per&s;ons fa&s;t all the Day, without eating or drinking, till the Stars appear in the Sky. That the Multi and his Clergy upon tho&s;e Days be cloath'd with Sackcloth, girt with Cords, with long Beards; and that they go in that po&s;ture, fir&s;t through the Streets, and then to the Churches, with their Eyes fix'd upon the Earth, lamenting and crying, <HI>Ja Aagib, Allah, Allah,</HI> that is to &s;ay, <HI>O Merciful God, O God.</HI> That they al&s;o take the Coffin of the Grand Prophet out of his Sepulchre in <HI>Mecca</HI> That after they have plac'd it in a Chair, they al&s;o take Twenty five more Coffins full of the Bones of tho&s;e who were formerly &s;lain fighting in Defence of the Mu&s;ulman Religion; which done, they &s;hall perfume 'em with Incen&s;e, to the end that by that means the great Prophet may be mov'd to employ his Interce&s;&s;ions to appea&s;e the Wrath of the Great God. That atter all this has been done upon the above-mention'd Days, and that they &s;hall have plac'd the Prophet's Coffin in the open Field, all Pilgrims and Inhabitants, as al&s;o all the Foreigners of all the Caravans, may walk &s;even times about the Coffin weeping and bewailing them&s;elves, and that the la&s;t Day of the Fa&s;t they make a &s;olemn Proce&s;&s;ion, Twenty Miles an end, in the following manner.</P>
<P N="1">1. Six thou&s;and Turks &s;hall lead the way cloath'd in Sackloth, girt with Cords, bare-foot, &amp; with|out Turbans, carrying a Box full of dead Mens Bones, with broken Scimitars, &s;mall ru&s;ty Firearms, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Three thou&s;and other Mu&s;&s;elmen all bloody, cover'd with A&s;hes, &s;hall follow them, bewailing them&s;elves, and tearing their Cloaths.</P>
<P N="3">3. Six thou&s;and Per&s;ons naked from the Wa&s;t upward, &s;hall follow them, whipping their Backs and Brea&s;ts with Thorns till they fetch blood, which &s;hall drop upon the Ground, nor &s;hall they be &s;uffer'd to rub or wipe them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="4">4. After them &s;hall appear Three thou&s;and Spahi's bareheaded, with long Beards, carrying the Prophet's Coffin, who &s;hall be &s;urrounded with Three hundred Ba&s;ha's with naked Swords, and if any one &s;hall offer to take off his Eyes from looking &s;tedfa&s;tly upon the Coffin, the Ba&s;ha's &s;hall pre|&s;ently kill him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">&rindx;</NOTE> and ca&s;t his body to the Dogs. 5 At the end of every Mile they &s;hall put to the Sword a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Slave, and a <HI>Jew</HI>; and they &s;hell let 'em die in their own Blood. 6. Thirty Ba&s;ha's, Governours of Provinces, &s;hall follow them without Purple, and with Turbans of plain black Cloth, dy'd before hand in the Blood of a <HI>Jew</HI> &amp; an A&s;s: and every one of the&s;e Ba&s;ha's &s;hall have one Hand bound behind him, and in&s;tead of a Sword &s;hall wear a long Camel's Tail trailing upon the Ground. 7. Three thou&s;and Janizaries &s;hall follow them without Arms, but with Battoons, which they &s;hall trail after 'em, and they &s;hall cry out, <HI>Allah bize ramah eile, Lord be Merciful unto us.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. Next to them &s;hall come a Che&s;t full of Money, which &s;hall be &s;catter'd upon the Road. But the Poor &s;hall be forbid, upon pain of being empal'd, to touch the Money before the end of the Proce&s;&s;ion, 9. La&s;tly, The Concour&s;e of People &s;hall clo&s;e the Proce&s;&s;ion. In the mid&s;t of the Crowd there &s;hall walk a Hundred Santons, or otherwi&s;e Turki&s;h Hermites, who &s;hall cut their Arms, Brea&s;ts, and Faces, with Knives, till the Blood drop upon the Ground, and at the end of every Mile they &s;hall lift up their Hands to Heaven, and cry, <HI>Vengeance against the Chri&s;tians,</HI> and &s;ay, <HI>Allah Jek<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">a, Ja Allah erraman, 'Tis enough, Lord, most Merciful God.</HI></P>
<P>Advice from FRANCE. From <HI>Poitou</HI> they Write, that the Sieur <HI>de Maupeon d' Ablege,</HI> Intendant of Ju&s;tice, has given Sentence, without Appeal, upon &s;everal New Converts of that Country, that were a&s;&s;embl'd together for the Exerci&s;e of their Religion, two of which he caus'd to be hang'd, one at <HI>Poitiers,</HI> and the other at St. <HI>Maixant,</HI> and he has al&s;o condemn'd &s;everal to the Galleys, others to Bani&s;hment, and others to terrible Forfeitures.</P>
