<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>MANY of the rules of philo&s;ophizing, which Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> adopted, I think are good, and can|not be mended&mdash;In the following piece, I have been careful to attend to his four cardinal rules, e&s;pecially the fir&s;t, which is recited there at large.</P>
<P>But I can by no means approve of Sir <HI>I&s;aac's</HI> Hypo|the&s;is, viz. <HI>That all matter is originally the &s;ame</HI>; to &s;up|port &s;uch an hypothe&s;is, I am under the nece&s;&s;ity of cal|ling in to my aid, an almo&s;t infinite number of cau&s;es; mo&s;t of which are bani&s;hed, upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of the <HI>original divi&s;ion</HI> of matter, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of different qualities, as &s;et forth in the following di&s;cour&s;e. A deviation from Sir <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> may po&s;&s;ibly be thought pre&s;umptuous; but, I humbly conceive, I am kept in countenance from his fourth rule of philo&s;ophizing, viz. <HI>That propo&s;itions collected from phaenomena by induction, are to be deemed,</HI> (not|with&s;tanding contrary hypothe&s;is) <HI>either exactly, or very nearly true, until other phaenomena occur, by which they may be rendered either more accurate, or liable to exception.</HI></P>
<P>The di&s;covery that Doctor <HI>Franklin</HI> has made, in his electrical experiments, will I conceive, warrant both a departure from Sir <HI>I&s;aac's</HI> hypothe&s;is, and al&s;o an yatten|tion to another, more agreeable to his own rule; which ought to be held &s;acred among Philo&s;ophers, as a pole|&s;tar, and not teaze <HI>nature</HI> to find out a fir&s;t cau&s;e for al|mo&s;t every effect&mdash;For if, in order to explore the opera|tions of nature, experiments are to be attended to in one day, they are doubtle&s;s al&s;o to be attended to in another, with equal a&s;&s;iduity and care.</P>
<P>I have a great veneration for Sir <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> and e&s;teem him as one of the brighte&s;t luminaries, that ever enlighten'd the philo&s;ophic world: But I think it no diminution to his character, to &s;uppo&s;e that Doctor <HI>Franklin</HI> has, by a

cour&s;e of experiments, brought things to light, which were never before &s;ufficiently explored, and di&s;covered a genius equal to any that ever went before him.</P>
<P>As mo&s;t of the illu&s;trations were written on different topicks, and delivered before the medical &s;ociety at dif|ferent times, and never were de&s;igned to be publi&s;hed; and as this publication is in&s;i&s;ted on by a number of gen|tlemen, &s;ome at lea&s;t, of the be&s;t characters; and as pre&s;ent Inconveniencies will not allow &s;ufficient time to prepare the work for the pre&s;s, I beg the reader would excu&s;e the inaccuracies as well as digre&s;&s;ions, which may appear in &s;ome of them&mdash;And &s;hould this publication meet with a favourable reception, a new edition, with large additions and illu&s;trations, is in contemplation. But &s;hould any object to the general principle, I de&s;ire they would &s;tate their objections fairly, that the public may be under advantages to judge for them&s;elves, whether the general &s;entiments advanced in the following Piece, are well founded or not.</P>

<HEAD>DISCOURSE on FLUIDITY.</HEAD>
<P>ONE principal character of a fluid, as laid down by Mr. <HI>Martin,</HI> and &s;eems to be warranted by Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>&punc; is (viz.) <HI>That the particles compo&s;ing the &s;ame, are exceeding &s;mall,</HI> for, that <HI>the &s;mallne&s;s of the particles con|duces to fluidity,</HI> &s;ay they, <HI>is evident from hence: That the points of contact between &s;pheres, are in proportion to their diameters, and therefore grow le&s;s with their &s;pheres, and the le&s;s their points of contact, the le&s;s will be the cohe&s;ion, and the greater</HI> (of cour&s;e) <HI>their di&s;po&s;ition to fluidity, &amp;c.</HI>&mdash; upon which I would ob&s;erve fir&s;t; That if any given point of the contact of a &s;phere, even again&s;t a plane, is of any mea&s;ure of di&s;tance acro&s;s, 'tis plain and evi|dent, 'tis not an entire &s;phere; for that given di&s;tance, mu&s;t be a plane al&s;o, or it could not re&s;t upon a plane. Hence 'tis al&s;o plain and evident, that let their &s;pheres be great or &s;mall, it makes no odds in re&s;pect to the largene&s;s of their points of contact; But in re&s;pect to their number, it does; for the larger the &s;pheres, the fewer the number of their points of contact, in any gi|ven quantity of matter. Therefore, if we account for fluidity in their way, the larger the &s;pheres, the more fluid mu&s;t that body be; which we know is contrary to fact.</P>
<P>Fill any ve&s;&s;el with mu&s;k<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> ball, and elevate (for in|&s;tance) the &s;outh &s;ide of the ve&s;&s;el, until &s;ome of the balls begin to roll, not one of them will roll, until you bring the center of its gravity, north of the northermo&s;t point of its contact; 'Tis certain al&s;o, that you mu&s;t elevate the ve&s;&s;el ju&s;t as many degrees, in order to make fine pigeon &s;hot to roll, as to make cannon ball roll&mdash; And 'tis ju&s;t as certain, that the &s;ame ve&s;&s;el, being filled with any known fluid, and elevated on one &s;ide, the
<PB N="2" REF="018058_0005_0FA4B707C7833F90">
whole &s;urface, in&s;tantly alters accordingly, and forms a level&mdash;Thus I think I have made it fully to appear, that tho&s;e philo&s;ophers are mi&s;taken in this matter.</P>
<P>In the 2d. and 3d. place, they affirm, <HI>that they are both round and &s;mooth</HI>; here I would ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that if they are perfectly round, they mu&s;t, of cour&s;e be &s;mooth, for there can be no other idea of &s;moothne&s;s, but equa|lity in &s;urface&mdash;Moreover, &s;moothne&s;s, they make an ab&s;olute requi&s;ite to a fluid, <HI>for want of this quality,</HI> &s;ay they, <HI>altho' the particle were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all other mentioned in the definition, yet they would never con&s;titute a fluid, &s;ince nothing can be of greater ob&s;truction thereto, than a&s;perity or roughne&s;s of the &s;uperficies.</HI></P>
<P>Now I would ju&s;t ob&s;erve, for a moment, in what manner our theory mu&s;t run (in order to have it con&s;i&s;t|ent upon the hypothe&s;is, that &s;moothne&s;s is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to a fluid; it mu&s;t run thus, viz. That the particles compo&s;ing oleaginous &s;ub&s;tances, &s;uch as lard, tallow, &amp;c. together with the whole train of metallic &s;ub&s;tances; al&s;o mo&s;t &s;aline &s;ub&s;tances, &s;uch as &s;ea-&s;alt, pot-a&s;h, lap. infern. and even lunar cau&s;tic it&s;elf, when melted, are exceeding &s;mooth&mdash;Surely then, we ought to leave off the term acrid, as applied to them&mdash;Howe|ver, what has been &s;aid, I think &s;ufficient to prove, to any curious mind, that the account given by tho&s;e philo|&s;ophers concerning a fluid, is at lea&s;t, altogether un&s;ati&s;|factory&mdash;It were to be wi&s;hed therefore, that they had adhered more &s;trictly to the incomparable Sir <HI>I&s;aac's</HI> fir&s;t rule of philo&s;ophizing, viz. <HI>More cau&s;es of natural things are not to be admitted, than are both true and &s;ufficient to explain the phaenomena</HI>; for nature does nothing in vain, but is &s;imple, and delights not in &s;uperfluous cau&s;es of things. Accordingly the poet, although with a different view, ob|&s;erves,</P>
<L>"The univer&s;al cau&s;e,</L>
<L>'Acts not by partial, but by general laws;'</L>

<P><PB N="3" REF="018058_0006_0FA4B708227ECB98">It remains therefore, to account for fluidity on &s;ome more rational principles, and more agreeable to what we find to be fact&mdash;Fir&s;t then, we will attend to the follow|ing axiom, viz. <HI>Whenever we can procure a number of par|ticles or corpu&s;cles of common matter, of a &s;uitable configura|tion to attract the electrical effluvia on all &s;ides, &s;o as to form an electrical atmo&s;phere around each; we then have a fluid, without which electrical atmo&s;phere, there can be no proper fluid; becau&s;e, if the particles touch each other, altho' it &s;hould be even only in points, yet they would not be a fluid; altho' perhaps, they might be a pretty fine powder</HI>: Now there are two grand divi&s;ions into which all the matter compo&s;ing this &s;y&s;tem, ought to be divided, becau&s;e, attended with oppo&s;ite qualities and attributes&mdash;The fir&s;t is <HI>re|pul&s;ive matter,</HI> which is, by far, the mo&s;t abundant, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By this, it is not meant that the cubic mea&s;ure of all the &s;olid minuti&s;&s;imals of repellent matter, is more than the cubic mea&s;ure of all the &s;olid minuti&s;&s;imals of attractive matter; for this is unde|terminable: But that the extent of the aggregate &s;um of all the parts of &s;pace, which are occupied chiefly by repellent matter, is more than that of the aggregate &s;um of all the parts of &s;pace, oc|cupied chiefly by attractive matter&mdash;If we &s;hould attend to the great Sir <HI>I&s;aac's</HI> 4th rule of philo&s;ophizing, viz. <HI>That propo&s;itions col|lected from phaenomena by deduction are to be deemed</HI> (notwith|&s;tanding contrary hypothe&s;is) <HI>either exactly, or very nearly true, til other phaenomena occur, by which they may be rendered either more ac|curate, or liable to exception:</HI> And if, according to the great Doctor <HI>Franklin,</HI> we conclude that &s;pheres are kept a&s;under by electrical atmo&s;pheres, which I think experiment fully evinces, we &s;hall then readily determine, that the grand &s;pheres compo&s;ing this &s;y&s;tem, are kept a&s;under by the &s;ame kind of repelling atmo&s;pheres; and that the repelling atmo&s;phere, which keeps this earth from a nearer ap|proach to the &s;un, may extend many hundreds of miles above, or beyond the &s;urface of the air; and con&s;equently, near the &s;urface of &s;aid atmo&s;phere, the repelling particles mu&s;t &s;tand at very great di&s;tances from each other&mdash;That there are di&s;tances, vacuums, or inter&s;tices, between the impenetrable, or &s;olid particles of both at|tractive and repellent matter is undeniable, &s;ince otherwi&s;e there could be no motion: But the various phenomena of things, render it probable, at lea&s;t, that there is no one point, in the univer&s;e, in which the influence of both attractive and repellent matter is not extended; and this influence, being a phy&s;ical entity: Therefore, in this view, there can be no vacuum.</NOTE>

and &s;econdly <HI>attractive or common matter,</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Attractive matter is called common matter, becau&s;e its princi|pal characteri&s;tics are commonly under&s;tood; its figure or &s;hape, being plainly di&s;coverable by the eye; whereas repul&s;ive matter can never be di&s;coverable by the eye, becau&s;e the rays of light, which paint the figure of all objects of &s;ight, are doubtle&s;s, no other, than particles of repul&s;ive matter.</NOTE> which occupies but a &s;mall proportionate part of &s;pace. One very princi|pals, as well as peculiar attribute of the former, is an invariably repul&s;ive quality, whereby its particles con|&s;tantly and violently repel each other; but as con&s;tantly attract, and of con&s;equence, are attracted by all common matter&mdash;Which la&s;t, in re&s;pect of repul&s;ive matter, may be &s;ub-divided into <HI>plus</HI> and <HI>minus,</HI> or more and le&s;s at|tractive powers. Again there is a &s;ub-divi&s;ion to be made in repellant matter al&s;o, as appears from electrical experiments on the vitrious and re&s;inous electricity; but to determine preci&s;ely, how they are di&s;po&s;ed towards, or affected by each other, mu&s;t be referred to more ac|curate, as well as a greater number of experiments.&mdash; The pecular characteri&s;tic and principal attribute of common matter, is, that its particles con&s;tantly and pow|erfully attract each other, and al&s;o tho&s;e of repul&s;ive mat|ter&mdash;And when by any <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">When, by violence, any attempt is made to rob any portion of attractive matter, of its natural proportion of the repul&s;ive, the ex|traordinary proportionate increa&s;e of attraction, in regard to the repul&s;ive, &s;hews the wi&s;dom of the creator, in di&s;po&s;ing that imma|terial e&s;&s;ence, which is connected with &s;aid attractive matter, thus to act, in order that there &s;hould not be a coale&s;&s;ence of attractive matter, upon every trivial occa&s;ion.</NOTE> violence, they are robbed of their natural proportion of the repul&s;ive, (in any degree) in the &s;ame proportion are their attractions, in regard to the repul&s;ive, both &s;tronger, and to a greater di&s;tance; and all the&s;e attractions, and repul&s;ions are, <HI>coeteris pa|ribus,</HI> proportionate to the quantity of matter, and their nearne&s;s; and from the&s;e axioms, together with the con&s;ideration of the <HI>vis inertiae</HI> of matter may be de|duced, the general laws, to which are &s;ubjected all the fluids and &s;olids, hitherto known; and all the motion in

the material world, where &s;pirit is not the immediate &amp; efficient cau&s;e&mdash;Here it may be a&s;k'd what then, are rays of light, which the great Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI> affirms to be material &s;ub&s;tances? and certainly they produce much motion, rarify air, and other &s;ub&s;tances, produce that bri&s;k acti|on called fire, &amp;c.</P>
<P>If I was to attend to the afore&s;aid rule of Philo&s;ophi|zing, viz. <HI>not to admit more cau&s;es, than are, both true and &s;ufficient to explain the phaenomena,</HI> I would an&s;wer, that a &s;olar ray of light, is no other than a particle of this &s;ame repul&s;ive matter, ju&s;t now de&s;cribed, projected forth from the &s;urface of the &s;un, with &s;uch force as to over|come the re&s;i&s;tance made by the attracting matter in that body; and &s;uddenly pa&s;&s;ing into a repelling medium, with little, or no re&s;i&s;tance, it almo&s;t in&s;tantaneou&s;ly pa&s;&s;|es in the inter&s;tices, or &s;eams near the verge of their &s;e|veral &s;pheres of repul&s;ion; much after the manner that a honey-bee pa&s;&s;es, when the hunter takes his line&mdash;When it arrives at the air's &s;urface, it finds more re&s;i&s;tance; but from thence to the earth, is a &s;mall proportionate di&s;|tance&mdash;When the rays of light arrive at the earth, ac|cording to Sir <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> they are there mo&s;tly ab&s;orded&mdash; How that great philo&s;opher means to be under&s;tood by this, I am at a lo&s;s; whether he means that they are annihilated, or that they have a&s;&s;i&s;ted, in increa&s;ing the bulk of this earth for near &s;ix thou&s;and years; in con&s;equence where|of, the &s;un has grown le&s;s, in that proportion&mdash;True, I don't find, that he gives us any account of them after this; but I rather think, that had he lived in this day, with advantage of the di&s;coveries of that equally great philo|&s;opher, Doctor <HI>Franklin,</HI> he would have employed them in &s;upplying the place of tho&s;e large quantities of elec|tricity, or repul&s;ive matter, which are continually pa&s;|&s;ing from this globe, to other parts of the &s;y&s;tem, to re&s;tore an equilibrium in the &s;ame; and that &s;ome of them a&s;&s;i&s;ted in pre&s;erving a fluid &s;tate in air, &s;ome in water. &amp;c.</P>
<P>I would here take notice of a very curious experiment, that now occurs to my mind, that has been often try'd,
<PB N="6" REF="018058_0009_0FA4B70A5EE5E1B0">
tho' not attended to&mdash;I mean the collection of nitre from air; a principal part of which la&s;t, con&s;i&s;ting of <HI>plus</HI> at|tractive matter, thence collects around each particle, a very large atmo&s;phere of the repul&s;ive&mdash;When the wind, in this country, blows from the N. W. and the&s;e repelling atmo&s;pheres, are from any cau&s;e con&s;iderably le&s;&s;en'd, the projectile motion of the air, being a force added to that of the natural attraction there is between the aerial par|ticles, and that of the terrene alkaline &s;alt; urges the former (notwith&s;tanding its repul&s;ive atmo&s;phere) direct|ly on to the &s;aline point; which being accute, more ea|&s;ily enters, taking off the &s;aid repelling atmo&s;phere as it approaches, from the known laws of electricity; whence the &s;aid aerial and terrene particles, becoming one, are now of a figure not fit to hold a repelling atmo&s;phere, on all &s;ides, having a point that is con&s;tantly throwing off, as fa&s;t as the other part, tho' <HI>plus</HI> attractive, can take on; &amp; thus polarity being form'd between the&s;e two primogenial particles, (both which now conjunctly form one corpu&s;cle) a number of tho&s;e corpu&s;cles, being immerg'd in a fluid capable to &s;u&s;pend them, ea&s;ily form into &s;hoots which we call nitre; and thus the original fluid and &s;olid par|ticles forming this corpu&s;cle, are generally, both conti|nued in a &s;olid form, until &s;ome ignited particle is pro|jected, with &s;uch force, as to knock off the &s;aid &s;aline particle, leaving the aerial naked, and in its original fi|gure; whence it immediately demands its original quan|tity of repul&s;ive atmo&s;phere; in gaining of which, there being &s;uch violent and in&s;tantaneous demand for room, there are numbers more of tho&s;e &s;piculae knock'd off by the &s;udden motion of the repellent matter; as al&s;o nearly all the adjacent particles of common matter, projected from thence, with an ignited force, in among the adjacent ma&s;s; and thus is produced a general explo&s;ion of the whole&mdash;The terrene and aerial particles, being thus &s;epa|rated, the former precipitates to the earth from whence it originated, and there lies ready, either to a&s;&s;i&s;t in form|ing nitre again, or to perform all the offices of vegetati|on, &amp;c. that belong to that particular &s;ub&s;tance; and
<PB N="7" REF="018058_0010_0FA4B70F9332FE48">
the latter is now become a fluid again: And as &s;oon as it has had &s;ufficient time to part with its extraordinary quantity of repul&s;ive atmo&s;phere, is fitted to perform all the purpo&s;es of re&s;piration, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Let us next take a view of human blood; I mean, in an athletic per&s;on. This we may con&s;ider as an hetero|geneous ma&s;s, con&s;i&s;ting of particles or corpu&s;cles of com|mon matter, differing, not only in magnitude, but figure al&s;o; whence they are both <HI>plus</HI> and <HI>minus</HI> attractive&mdash; Now the con&s;tant friction, occa&s;ioned by the action of the heart and arteries, collects &s;uch large quantities of repul&s;ive matter, that the proportion that each of the <HI>minus</HI> attractive particles naturally take to them&s;elves, proves &s;ufficient to produce a fluid &s;tate in them; le&s;&s;en that friction, to a &s;ufficient degree, by taking the blood from tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els, or by any means prevent this extraor|dinary quantity of repul&s;ive matter collecting in their neighbourhood, &s;o that the proportion of the repul&s;ive that belongs to each <HI>minus</HI> attractive corpu&s;cle, is not &s;ufficient to counteract the natural attraction there is be|tween them&s;elves, and they immediately coale&s;ce; and then, we &s;ay the blood is coagulated.</P>
<P>And on the&s;e principles only, have I ever been able to account for the coagulation of any fluid <HI>whatever</HI>&mdash;But here comes a que&s;tion, viz. <HI>How comes it to pa&s;s then, that the fluids in an egg are coagulated by an extraordinary degree of heat?</HI> I an&s;wer, that the <HI>plus</HI> attractive particles, which, by their intervention, render fluid all the re&s;t, are &s;o &s;hap'd, and &s;o extremely minute with-all, that upon any con&s;iderable addition of repul&s;ive matter, they make their e&s;cape, even through the &s;hell; hence the remaining par|ticles immediately coale&s;ce.</P>
<P>In farther illu&s;tration of this &s;ubject, let us next take a view of the effects of fro&s;t on human fle&s;h; and in or|der to a right under&s;tanding of this matter, it may be nece&s;&s;ary fir&s;t to inquire, what &s;ort of &s;ub&s;tance may be the proper &s;ubject of fro&s;t&mdash;And here fir&s;t negatively, 'tis neither air, nor earth, nor &s;pirit, nor any of the ole|aginous &s;ub&s;tances; for neither of tho&s;e having been
<PB N="8" REF="018058_0011_0FA4B70FF7D05868">
placed in a &s;ituation ever &s;o cold, do we agree to call fro|zen&mdash;But 2dly and po&s;itively, water alone is, perhaps, the only proper &s;ubject of fro&s;t; and therefore a di&s;co|very of the mechanical operation of fro&s;t on water, will naturally lead the mind to a right view of its effects on human fle&s;h&mdash;Now then, we are to con&s;ider the effects of fro&s;t on water; and here I would make the following ob|&s;ervations, viz. 1&s;t. That water, in an open ve&s;&s;el, can|not be heated beyond the 212th degree by Farenheit's thermometer; becau&s;e, if you add to the water any far|ther degree of heat, the aqueous particles in&s;tantly take to them&s;elves, &s;uch large and complete repelling atmo&s;pheres, as to ca&s;t them out of the &s;pheres of the corpu&s;cular attrac|tion of each other, and thence they become air; for there is doubtle&s;s no e&s;&s;ential difference between water and air, only the particles compo&s;ing the one are within, but the other without the &s;pheres of their corpu&s;cular attractions. 2dly. That water will decrea&s;e in its quantity or bulk, exactly according to the increa&s;e of cold, from the high|e&s;t po&s;&s;ible degree of its rarefaction, viz. From the 212th degree of heat, even down to the 32d degree&mdash;Now 'tis plain, that in all this proce&s;s, the aqueous particles are con&s;tantly approaching nearer to each other; but when it comes to the 32d degree, which is the freezing point, and the particles are about to come in contact, the quan|tity or bulk of the water will in&s;tantly be enlarg'd, by rea&s;on that the particles of the &s;ame, in order to pre&s;ent their more angular or pointed parts to each other, will alter their &s;ituation, by &s;uddenly turning out of that clo&s;e and compact po&s;ition, re&s;pecting each other, in which they were before con&s;tantly kept, by common gravitation. Hence, ice occupies more cubic mea&s;ure, and of con&s;e|quence, is &s;pecifically lighter than water.</P>

<P>I beg leave here to recite the following, nearly as it was delivered before the &s;ociety:</P>
<P>Di&s;cour&s;e on Burns and Scalds.</P>
<P>THE chief de&s;ign of the following di&s;cour&s;e, being to point out a method of treating tho&s;e wounds received by fire, (commonly called burns or &s;calds) better, and more rational than is commonly practi&s;ed in the country; and it being generally nece&s;&s;ary to inve&s;tigate the cau&s;e of a di&s;ea&s;e, before we can proceed to pre&s;cribe a ration|al method of cure; it may be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve the following method, viz. Fir&s;t to &s;ay &s;omething on the e&s;|&s;ence of fire; 2dly, on the mechanical operation in its action; 3dly, its effects on human fle&s;h; and then pro|ceed to the general intention:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, I am to &s;ay &s;omething concerning the e&s;|&s;ence of fire&mdash;This has been thought, (perhaps by &s;ome of the greate&s;t geniu&s;es in all ages, from the fir&s;t crea|tion of the world, even down to the pre&s;ent day) to be one of the mo&s;t &s;urprizing and unaccountable creatures of God: &s;ome of the antients ob&s;erv'd that wherever a man was (and could him&s;elf &s;ub&s;i&s;t) whether on Pizgah's top, or in the deepe&s;t vault, on board a &s;hip, many leagues off at &s;ea, or in the hold of the &s;ame, many feet beneath the &s;urface of the water, in open day, or even in the darke&s;t dungeon, if he &s;hould only do this &s;mall homage, viz. To &s;trike two hard &s;ub&s;tances together, &s;uch as a flint and a bit of &s;teel, or the like&mdash;This won|derful e&s;&s;ence would in&s;tantly make its appearance to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, pre&s;enting him a comfortable degree of both light and heat&mdash;This circum&s;tance looking &s;o much like omnipre&s;ence, many of them mi&s;took this creature for the creator, and wor&s;hiped it accordingly; and no won|der, for I think, that without the light of a divine reve|lation
<PB N="10" REF="018058_0013_0FA4B712A7C774D8">
the mi&s;take mu&s;t have been, in their day, pretty ea&s;y and natural&mdash;Among the modern of all the writers on the e&s;&s;ence of fire, that I have had the peru&s;al of, I think the great <HI>Boerhaave,</HI> appears to be the mo&s;t in|genious; but he, gro&s;sly mi&s;took his point&mdash;He gave us no &s;atisfactory account of the e&s;&s;ence of fire, neither is this to be wondered at, for he &s;ought it where it was not to be found, viz. In material &s;ub&s;tance&mdash;But he who rightly attends to the very intere&s;ting di&s;coveries of the great Doctor <HI>Franklin,</HI> will find, that the e&s;&s;ence of fire con&s;i&s;ts in motion; and that this motion is a parti|cular effect of certain qualities, viz. Attraction, and repul&s;ion, and the <HI>vis inertiae</HI> of matter; and that no|thing appears, but that the &s;ame particle that did once attract, ever continues to attract, and that the particle that did once repel, continues &s;o to act, and that they both con&s;tantly and invariably ob&s;erve all the laws of at|traction and repul&s;ion, whether they a&s;&s;i&s;t in compo&s;ing the body which we call frozen, or that of a hot flame. I come now to con&s;ider the mechanical operation in its ac|tion &mdash; And here, fir&s;t I would con&s;ider that mo&s;t eminent of all, that appears in the explo&s;ion of nitre, which the reader may reflect has been before particularly treated of, under the head of the formation of that &s;ub&s;tance, where we have a view of the mechanical operation of a fire, the mo&s;t &s;udden and violent&mdash;Now, in order to render this fire le&s;s violent and more la&s;ting, (&s;uch as might an|&s;wer to a culinary fire) you have nothing farther to do, but to add thereto and intimately mix with the nitrous ma&s;s, a &s;ufficient quantity of attractive matter, who&s;e intervening particles, are le&s;s attractive, in regard to the repul&s;ive; and you then have a view of a culinary fire, which will be more or le&s;s violent, according to the quantity of intervening matter, and according as the &s;aid intervening matter is more or le&s;s attractive, in re|gard to the repul&s;ive; thus much for the mechanical operation of fire in its action&mdash;I am now thirdly to con|&s;ider the effect of this action of fire, on human fle&s;h; and here fir&s;t I would ob&s;erve, that whenever any body of
<PB N="11" REF="018058_0014_0FA4B7135FE66990">
matter, heated to a high degree, is oppo&s;ed &s;o near to human fle&s;h, as that the ignited particles that are pro|jected from &s;aid heated body, enter, and pa&s;s thro' the inter&s;tices of the &s;olid fle&s;h, with &s;uch force and in &s;uch abundance, as by their extraordinary friction, to invite &s;uch large quantities of repelling, into the region of the fle&s;h, as that the particles or corpu&s;cles compo&s;ing the &s;olid fibre of the fle&s;h, beginning to take to them&s;elves &s;uch large and complete repelling atmo&s;pheres, as whol|ly to overcome the re&s;i&s;tance made by that attraction, whereby they &s;ub&s;i&s;t in a natural fibre; then we may ju&s;tly &s;ay, that fle&s;h is burn'd or &s;called: And it is doubt|le&s;s impo&s;&s;ible, by any art whatever, to re-vivificate, or re&s;tore this fle&s;h to proper life again&mdash;But there is a &s;eam or &s;pace between this dead fle&s;h, and that which has &s;uf|fered nothing as yet by this extraordinary flux of repel|lency, in which the <HI>plus</HI> attractive ends or parts, of the component particles or corpu&s;cles, &s;tand at di&s;tances from each other; while the other ends or parts, that are more pointed, and therefore <HI>minus</HI> attractive, adhere &s;till to the healthy part&mdash;This gives to the patient, the idea of extreme pain, and is, according to the great <HI>Boerhaave's</HI> definition of pain, viz. A tendency towards a di&s;&s;oluti|on of continuity, in the component parts of a fibre&mdash; Thus much for its effects on human fle&s;h&mdash;I am now to point out a method of treating tho&s;e wounds received by fire; and the fir&s;t intention appears to be, to pre&s;erve from putrefaction, that portion of fle&s;h, which is be|twixt the healthy and the dead fle&s;h; which can be done in no way, but by applying, externally, tho&s;e &s;ub&s;tances as will &s;o violently attract the repellency from the inter|&s;tices of its component parts, as that its particles will coale&s;ce with each other, in the &s;ame manner as they did in the healthy &s;tate. The &s;ub&s;tance which mo&s;t &s;trongly attracts, and is the be&s;t conductor for the electricity, is cold water&mdash;But that it may be holden, with convenience to the part, I have made a catapla&s;m therewith, by the admixture of &s;ome farinaceous &s;ub&s;tances; &s;uch as Indi|an meal, &s;crap'd potatoes, or the like&mdash;Some object to
<PB N="12" REF="018058_0015_0FA4B714264E1378">
this practice and &s;ay, it &s;ubjects the patient to take cold, &s;o much cold water, &amp;c. being applied: But it ought to be con&s;idered, that as taking cold is no other than per&s;pira|tion being ob&s;tructed&mdash;Per&s;piration, in this ca&s;e, cannot be ob&s;tructed, for that is already done, by an ab&s;olute de&s;truction of the cutaneous glands; therefore not the lea&s;t danger from this quarter.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as your poultice is on, the pain cea&s;es; but when the pain returns, change your poultice, for the part next to the fle&s;h has, by the heat of the fle&s;h, be|come &s;o warm, that it does not attract the repellency &s;trongly enough&mdash;And thus we ought always to proceed, until this kind of incipient gangrene is intirely gone; and then apply dige&s;tives, &amp;c. as in ca&s;e of other wounds, and it will be found to heal as fa&s;t as any other whate|ver&mdash;Thus much for external application&mdash;But it often happens, that &s;o great a part of the cutis is de&s;troy'd by a burn or &s;cald, that &s;uch a proportion of the <HI>materia per&s;pirabila</HI> is retained in the habit, as that (by a coale&s;|cence of its particles, and &s;o forming ob&s;tructions) a fe|ver is the con&s;equence; and this fever is generally very highly inflammatory, and therefore very dangerous; for being ardent, it very often turns malignant&mdash;Therefore, when a per&s;on is con&s;iderably burn'd or &s;called, he ought always to be carefully watched by the phy&s;ician; and upon the very fir&s;t appearance of a fever, either phlebo|tomy or a cathartic febrifuge, or both, ought forthwith to be admini&s;tered; and in this way, may the fever be entirely prevented, and a perfect cure will &s;ucceed, as fa&s;t as the wheels of nature can advance&mdash;Now if the&s;e &s;entiments are ju&s;t, and this practice warrantable, and I think they can be vindicated, upon the mo&s;t &s;trict theo|retical principles, as well as reiterated experiments; then how may we deplore, the excruciating torture, experi|enced chiefly by tho&s;e who are in their tender years of childhood, as well as lo&s;s of life occa&s;ioned by a contra|ry practice?</P>
<P>I would next, take a view of that perpetual motion in an animal, call'd <HI>re&s;piration</HI>&mdash;The reader may remem|ber,
<PB N="13" REF="018058_0016_0FA4B714EA958510">
that when &s;peaking about the particles of attrac|tive matter, it was ob&s;erv'd, that when, (by any vio|lence they are robb'd of their natural proportion of the repul&s;ive in any degree) in the &s;ame proportion are their attractions, in regard to the repul&s;ive, both &s;tronger, and to a greater di&s;tance.</P>
<P>This appears from the manner of collecting the repel|lent matter, by the electrical apparatus; for by rubbing the globe again&s;t the cu&s;hion, and &s;o con&s;tantly robbing the outermo&s;t vitreous particles, of their natural propor|tion of the repul&s;ive; you not only, hence charge your apparatus with electricity, but impregnate the region round about; nay, the whole electric room is &s;o filled with repellent matter, that atoms, floating in the air, take to them&s;elves &s;uch large repelling atmo&s;pheres, that they are &s;een for a long time after, to repel each other at con|&s;iderable di&s;tances; but in time, an equilibrium is re&s;tored. Now the body of an animal, may be compar'd to the electric room, the blood and arteries, which keep a con&s;tant friction, to the gla&s;s globe and cu&s;hion, and perhaps the nervous ve&s;&s;els to the conductor, or common recepticle of the repellent matter; now by the friction, occa&s;ioned by the motion of the blood, there are large quantities of repellent matter collected therein, which is generally pretty equally di&s;tributed throughout the whole ma&s;s. In a <HI>faetus in utero,</HI> where the fluids in the <HI>faetus, amnios,</HI> &amp; mo|ther, are all &s;o connected, as that if you le&s;&s;en the quan|tity of repellency in the one, you al&s;o dimini&s;h it in the other&mdash;They all conjunctly forming one general ma&s;s, the mother breathing for the whole, they are generally all equally fraught with repellent matter.</P>
<P>In all <HI>faetu&s;es,</HI> both of viviparous, and oviparous ani|mals, although the lungs are found collap&s;ed, the mouth &s;hut, &amp;c. yet the <HI>a&s;pera arteria,</HI> &amp; <HI>bronchii,</HI> are ever found nearly empty, open, and not collap&s;ed, as the lungs are; yet the fluids in the <HI>amnios</HI> (being equally fraught with repellent matter) are not attracted by the blood in the lungs, which is the rea&s;on, why the lungs are not fill'd with the fluids contain'd in the <HI>amnios</HI>; but as &s;oon as
<PB N="14" REF="018058_0017_0FA4B715ACB246A8">
the cold air takes place in lieu of the &s;aid fluids, it be|ing mo&s;t violently attracted by the blood in the lungs, immediately ru&s;hes in <HI>qua data porta,</HI> and inflates them&mdash; But, when the air has enter'd the lungs, it cannot &s;tay there for a moment&mdash;But being divided into an almo&s;t infinite number of &s;treams, that are &s;urrounded by &s;o great a proportion of blood, in the <HI>pulmonie</HI> and other arteries, and their returning veins, the arteries coming in a direct cour&s;e from the right ventricle of the heart, and fraught with as much repellent matter, as any part of the juices; hence the aeriel particles, (taking to them|&s;elves an equal quantity of repellent matter, and thereby forming exceeding large repelling atmo&s;pheres) are thence immediately forced out, by way of the mouth or no&s;e&mdash; Here, at fir&s;t thought, it would be natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that no more air would be forc'd out, than to re&s;tore an equilibrium; and that therefore there was nothing to oc|ca&s;ion a &s;econd in&s;piration&mdash;But it ought to be con&s;ider|ed, that the <HI>pulmonic</HI> blood, that has ju&s;t &s;uffered a great lo&s;s of repellent matter, which was taken out of it, and carried off, in the aeriel atmo&s;pheres of the la&s;t expiration, is directly replete with its proportion of repellency, from the remainder of the ma&s;s of blood; hence the &s;ame cau&s;e obtains, to produce a &s;econd in&s;piration, as did in the fir&s;t, and &s;o on&mdash;Thus, I think, I have given a me|chanical account of the true cau&s;e of re&s;piration.</P>
<P>I am now to &s;ay &s;omething concerning its u&s;e, which is very great indeed; for without it, animal life, by the known laws of nature, could not exi&s;t: All animals that have fallen under our in&s;pection, do breathe; even from an elephant, down to the &s;malle&s;t reptile; from a &s;tork, to an hou&s;e-fly; and from a whale, even down to a &s;prat; they all breathe, that is, they do in&s;pire, or &s;uck in; and then, at &s;hort intervals, puff out again &s;ome kind of fluid; &s;ome have their lungs &s;eated in one part, &s;ome in ano|ther; the common hou&s;e-fly has her's &s;eated near the mid|dle of the back, and the <HI>trachea</HI> comes out a little be|hind the wing; but &s;he does breathe&mdash;And it double&s;s an&s;wers the &s;ame grand purpo&s;e, as in other animals, that
<PB N="15" REF="018058_0018_0FA4B71663CB8B30">
is, it pre&s;erves a con&s;tant &s;tream or current of electricity or repellent matter, through &s;ome certain tubes in the body of the animal; which &s;tream or current, is doubt|le&s;s the <HI>primum mobile,</HI> and efficient cau&s;e of all involun|tary animal motion; on which immediately depends, all tho&s;e motions which are voluntary, in which a mu&s;cle acts by the &s;ame laws, and in the &s;ame manner, as it does in that motion which is involuntary&mdash;Thus much appears to me ea&s;y, plain and natural; but here we mu&s;t &s;top with our re&s;earches&mdash;If we proceed any farther herein, we get on hallowed ground&mdash;This is too near the immediate finger of the creator&mdash;We know, the will does determine the time and quantity of motion, in every voluntary act of a mu&s;cle&mdash;But a knowledge of the manner, in which that &s;omething, which is capable of volition, acts on the body, pre&s;uppo&s;es a knowledge of the <HI>modus</HI> of union between &s;oul and body; which, I &s;hould think, nece&s;&s;arily implied in it, a knowledge of the <HI>modus</HI> in the operation of the divine &s;pirit, in the exerci&s;e of creating power, which double&s;s is a matter too deep, even for the highe&s;t created intelligence in Heaven to look into: Therefore, it can be no impeachment of the character of any gentleman, as a phy&s;ician&mdash;A wi&s;e man, or philo&s;o|pher, to &s;ay that he knows nothing about the matter.</P>

&s;he makes a cure; nay, I have often known her endea|vours &s;o forcible, that &s;he has finally perfected a cure, in &s;pite of both patient and quack, con&s;tantly affording her, all the interruption in their power; and &s;uch fa|vourable opportunity as this, (being all the knowledge the quack has in phy&s;ic) is in&s;tantly embraced, and by him publi&s;h'd in <HI>Gath,</HI> and affords him large opportu|nity to murder numbers with impunity.
