<Q><BIBL>ECCLESIASTES IX.I.</BIBL>
<P>&mdash;The Righteous, and the Wi&s;e, and their Works, are in the hand of God.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE uniformity of the divine di&s;pen&s;ations towards the righteous, and the wicked, was to A&s;aph, as he informs us in the 73d P&s;alm, a &s;ource of great perplexity and di&s;tre&s;s. It ap|pears, that he was deeply, and for a long time, employed in meditating on this my&s;terious &s;ub|ject; and, the more he con&s;idered it, the more he doubted and de&s;ponded. Reduced, at length, to a &s;tate bordering on agony and de&s;pair, he exclaim|ed "I have clean&s;ed my heart in vain, and wa&s;h|ed my hands in innocency; for all the day long have I been plagued, and cha&s;tened every morn|ing."</P>
<P>From the pro&s;perity of the wicked, and his own great adver&s;ity, he was led ultimately to indulge the&s;e unhappy &s;entiments, and to feel as if God had no re&s;t, no kindne&s;s, no peculiar care, for righteous men. This dangerous mi&s;take was however rectified, and the&s;e cen&s;urable feelings were removed, when he afterwards went to the &s;anctuary of God. Then under&s;tood he the end of the wicked. He &s;aw them &s;et in &s;lippery pla|ces, and ready to be ca&s;t down to de&s;truction. He
<PB N="6" REF="032069_0004_0FF10F4241E52F08">
&s;aw, that whatever apparent errors were found in the di&s;pen&s;ations of God, in the pre&s;ent world, would be finally proved not to be errors, by their connection with future di&s;pen&s;ations; that the Providence of God was one great &s;cheme, reach|ing through time, and through eternity; that the parts of it, exi&s;ting here, were to be explained by their con&s;equences, exi&s;ting hereafter; that, thus explained, all would be, and would be found to be, right; and that God would appear, as he had de|clared him&s;elf, and as a perfect Being mu&s;t be, the uniform friend of the Righteous, and the uniform enemy of the impenitently Wicked.</P>
<P>Solomon, a man of more exten&s;ive views, clo&s;e ob&s;ervation, and profound re&s;earch, than A&s;aph, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the very di&s;coveries made to A&s;aph, was enabled by the Divine Spirit to form more comprehen&s;ive, and more accurate ideas of this my&s;terious &s;ubject. Calmly and carefully exami|ning the circum&s;tances of men, and the Provi|dence of God, he &s;aw clearly, that "all things come alike to all; and that there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked." With the&s;e views he al&s;o determined ea&s;ily and certainly, that there is "no knowledge of the love or hatred" of God to any per&s;on "by all" that part of his Pro|vidence "which is before us"&mdash;by his pro&s;perity, or his adver&s;ity; and that he may be in either of the&s;e &s;ituations, and &s;till be wicked, or &s;till be righteous.</P>
<P>For all the&s;e things Solomon al&s;o di&s;covered a rea&s;on, which &s;atisfied him of the propriety of &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of di&s;pen&s;ations; viz. that all the&s;e things are in the hand of God. This Infinite Being, who rules all things, the greate&s;t and the lea&s;t, the be&s;t and the wor&s;t, alike, with univer&s;al and irre&s;i&s;tible
<PB N="7" REF="032069_0005_0FF10F4DC1D6CB70">
dominion, rules them, al&s;o, with a government perfectly wi&s;e and good. In the hand, and under the management, of &s;uch a Being, nothing, which is wrong, whatever may be the appearance to us, can exi&s;t; and nothing, which is right, and upon the whole de&s;irable, can fail to he accompli&s;hed. Things, which to our Minds are &s;trange and per|plexing, do indeed exi&s;t in immen&s;e multitudes. But this ought to be expected. The works of an infinitely wi&s;e and powerful Being mu&s;t of cour&s;e tran&s;cend our comprehen&s;ion. They mu&s;t &s;uit the nature, the &s;kill, wi&s;dom, power, and goodne&s;s, of &s;uch a Being, and mu&s;t wear the im|pre&s;&s;ions and proofs of his Character. Such a Character, we know, is far removed from our comprehen&s;ion; the particular di&s;plays of &s;uch a Character mu&s;t, therefore, be often equally incom|prehen&s;ible. The works of &s;uch a Being mu&s;t be de&s;igned to reach, either in their nature, or in their con&s;equences, through eternity and immen&s;ity. Hence the propriety of their exi&s;tence mu&s;t, in a great mea&s;ure, depend on things wholly unknown to us, and mu&s;t, in a great mea&s;ure, be hidden from our fight.</P>
<P>No works of God ought to be expected to par|take of this my&s;terious character more than his di&s;pen&s;ations to the righteous, and to the wicked. Moral beings are formed for endle&s;s duration; and all di&s;pen&s;ations towards them mu&s;t, there|fore, have a future reference, and involve con&s;e|quences, which will extend through eternity. Hence all the Providence of God re&s;pecting &s;uch beings mu&s;t be in the number of the mo&s;t my&s;|terious and incomprehen&s;ible events. The diffi|culties and perplexities found in this &s;ubject ought then to be con&s;idered as things of cour&s;e, as things nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;ing from the nature of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="032069_0006_0FF10F9BC9CA5518">Solomon has, therefore, exhibited this &s;ubject in the manner, which is mo&s;t proper, mo&s;t accor|dant with truth, and mo&s;t adapted to quiet unea|&s;ine&s;s, and relieve perplexity. We do not, indeed, &s;ee the rea&s;ons, why things are as they are; but we &s;ee &s;ufficient rea&s;ons to believe, that, though thus unknown, they are wi&s;ely ordered, and will terminate in the mo&s;t de&s;irable manner.</P>
<P>Among the my&s;terious di&s;pen&s;ations of God to the righteous, and the wicked, the prolongation of the lives of the wicked, when u&s;ele&s;s, and when noxious to &s;ociety, and the untimely termination of the lives of the righteous, when mo&s;t u&s;eful, has, to me at lea&s;t, &s;eemed peculiarly perplexing. The wicked often live to annoy and di&s;tre&s;s man|kind, and live to advanced age, &s;afe from &s;ickne&s;s, accident, and violence; while the righteous, not unfrequently, are cut off in the morning, or in the meridian, of their u&s;efulne&s;s; when all their ta|lents, their knowledge, experience, and wi&s;dom, their virtue, weight, and influence, are in their full &s;trength, and appear to have ri&s;en to this height, only to be de&s;troyed. In this &s;ituation the Mind, adopting the words of In&s;piration, &s;lightly altered, almo&s;t in&s;tinctively cries, "Where|fore ha&s;t thou made &s;uch men in vain?"</P>
<P>To remove the&s;e impre&s;&s;ions, and to introduce into their place &s;uch, as are more ju&s;t and evan|gelical, is the object of this di&s;cour&s;e, and the drift of the text, on which it is founded. If the melancholy event, which has called together this A&s;&s;embly, has affected them in &s;uch a manner, and with &s;uch thoughts, as it has affected me, &s;carcely any &s;ubject can be more &s;uited to the oc|ca&s;ion. The decea&s;ed was taken from the world in the full &s;trength of all his u&s;efulne&s;s, and while
<PB N="9" REF="032069_0007_0FF10F916323AE88">
employing all his faculties in the great bu&s;ine&s;s of doing exten&s;ive good. In the view of &s;uch an event the &s;erious Mind &s;earches for a &s;atisfying cau&s;e of the di&s;pen&s;ation, and is ready to &s;pend its thoughts, if not in murmuring and repining, yet in u&s;ele&s;s wonder, and cen&s;urable perplexity.</P>
<P>To di&s;pel the&s;e thoughts, and the emotions &s;pringing from them, no con&s;ideration can operate &s;o effectually as that, &s;ugge&s;ted by Solomon in the text. "The Righteous, and the Wi&s;e, and their works, are in the hand of God." To a coinci|dence with me in this opinion my Audience may perhaps be advantageou&s;ly led by the following ob&s;ervations, in which I &s;hall endeavour to &s;tate the real force of this important declaration.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, it teaches us, that there is no rea&s;on why we &s;hould wonder, that they are &s;o di&s;po&s;ed of, or that their concerns are ordered in &s;uch a manner.</P>
<P>In the great kingdom of the univer&s;e purpo&s;es infinitely numerous, and infinitely important, are to be accompli&s;hed, of which we have no com|prehen&s;ion. As the purpo&s;es are unknown to us, &s;o the proper means of accompli&s;hing them are al&s;o unknown. If we knew the ends, we &s;hould probably often &s;ee the means to be proper, and fit|ted to the end. The u&s;e&punc; which God intends to make of the righteous and their works, when he removes them from the pre&s;ent world, we cannot know. It lies beyond the grave, in a world in|vi&s;ible, in a &s;tate unknown. Were we acquaint|ed with that world, with the &s;tate of intellectual &s;ociety in it, and with the employments and inte|re&s;ts of the inhabitants, the difficulties, attending &s;uch events of Providence, as re&s;pect them, might probably vani&s;h; but, while the&s;e things are un|known,
<PB N="10" REF="032069_0008_0FF10F37C224CC30">
we can form no judgment of the proprie|ty, or impropriety, of &s;uch mea&s;ures. In the na|ture of the ca&s;e, therefore, we &s;ee &s;ufficient rea|&s;ons to determine, that God mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, or|der his Providence in this re&s;pect, in a manner my&s;terious to us. That it &s;hould be my&s;terious is wholly to be expected, and that it &s;hould not be my&s;terious cannot rationally be expected. In|&s;tead, therefore, of wondering why this part of Divine Providence is my&s;terious, we ought rather to wonder if at any time we &s;ee it dive&s;ted of my&s;|tery. The di&s;pen&s;ations are my&s;terious, becau&s;e they are the works of God, becau&s;e they are plan|ned and executed by an infinite Mind, and becau&s;e they reach in their con&s;equences throughout e|ternity. The ways of &s;uch a Being reaching through &s;uch an extent mu&s;t be nece&s;&s;arily in|comprehen&s;ible to beings of ye&s;terday, who know comparatively nothing. With this con&s;ideration in view, our doubts, of this nature, retire of cour&s;e, our perplexities vani&s;h, our fears, that the world is not wi&s;ely and happily governed, are re|moved, and our murmuring again&s;t that govern|ment is effectually prevented.</P>
<P>A&s;aph, had he thus thought, and thought as exten&s;ively as Solomon appears to have done, would never have concluded, that he had clean&s;|ed his heart in vain. With his excellent di&s;po&s;i|tion he would willingly have left the whole &s;ub|ject, unknown as it was, to the di&s;po&s;al of God, and re&s;ted quietly on his wi&s;dom, equity, and con|duct of the univer&s;e. All who are like A&s;aph in di&s;po&s;ition, will, if they remember, and realize, tne declaration of Solomon, entertain the &s;ame views, and experience the &s;ame re&s;ignation.</P>
<P N="2">2ndly. The &s;ame declaration a&s;&s;ures us, that
<PB N="11" REF="032069_0009_0FF10F50F888D2F8">
the Righteous are di&s;po&s;ed of by de&s;ign, and not by accident, and according to the plea&s;ure of God, and not of any other.</P>
<P>We are accu&s;tomed frequently to call the di&s;|pen&s;ations of Providence by names, very ill ex|pre&s;&s;ing their real character. We &s;tile them ac|cidents and contingencies, good and ill luck, good and ill fortune, happy and unhappy chances. Our &s;ucce&s;s and our di&s;appointments, we attribute to our foreca&s;t and prudence, or to the want of them, to our indu&s;try and exertions, or to our negligence and &s;loth, or to an unknown &s;omewhat, which we term nature, fortune, or chance. With &s;uch words in our mouths, and the corre&s;ponding &s;en|timents in our hearts, we often boa&s;t of our attain|ments, and glory in our talents and efforts.</P>
<P>Our wi&s;dom and energy have, at times, unque&s;|tionably a &s;hare in effectuating the good, which we enjoy; as our folly and indolence have in ac|compli&s;hing the evil which we &s;uffer. God u&s;es us as his in&s;truments in promoting his de&s;igns. His kingdom is a kingdom of means, in which the faculties and exertions of his creatures are con|tinually employed by him to accompli&s;h his own glorious purpo&s;es. At the &s;ame time it is &s;till true, that "a man's goings are of the Lord." Paul at the utmo&s;t can only plant; Apollos can only water; God, and God only can give the in|crea&s;e. Pride and boa&s;ting have, therefore, no foundation in the nature of things. Rea&s;on, as well as Revelation, &s;ays, "Let him, that glori|eth, glory in the Lord."</P>
<P>Providence, while it employs our faculties, in|fluences al&s;o by ten thou&s;and unfore&s;een events our various purpo&s;es, directs our &s;teps, and regulates our lot, both in the pre&s;ent and future world.
<PB N="12" REF="032069_0010_0FF10F43D45D3608">
A &s;troke of lightning, the &s;tumbling of a hor&s;e, a defect in a bridge, a leak in a &s;hip, a worm, a fly; an atom, have deeply affected the affairs of men, di&s;concerted ambitious de&s;igns, ruined va&s;t enter|pri&s;es, and changed wholly the &s;tate of individu|als, nations, and ages. Creatures, on whom the&s;e things can &s;o greatly operate, ought to be far re|moved from boa&s;ting of them&s;elves, or of their attainments.</P>
<P>Luck, fortune, chance, and accident, are names, which, if &s;eriou&s;ly u&s;ed, have no meaning. Not a &s;parrow falls to the ground without our heaven|ly Father. Not a hair le&s;s, nor more, than the al|lotted number, is found on our heads. All things are providential; all are of God; all are the re&s;ult of wi&s;dom, contrivance and determination. The lea&s;t &s;u&s;tain this character as truly as the greate&s;t. From this the only ju&s;t view of events the mind is naturally and greatly led off by a cu&s;tomary u&s;e of the language, which I have reprobated.</P>
<P>Whether we are di&s;po&s;ed to this method of con&s;idering events, or not, we cannot he&s;itate to regard in this manner tho&s;e events, which re&s;pect the righteous, if we receive and realize the decla|ration of the Text&punc; They, and their works, their talents, and their intere&s;ts, are in the hand of God. Nothing, which befals them, can be the re&s;ult of accident. Every thing, on the contrary, mu&s;t be fore&s;een, cho&s;en, and provided for, and of cour&s;e is adopted from full knowledge of the propriety of its exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>As God is the &s;upreme, and all pre&s;ent, as well all knowing di&s;po&s;er, &s;o nothing can befal the righteous, but in accordance with his will, and as the re&s;ult of his plea&s;ure. The oppo&s;ing wi&s;hes, aims, and efforts, of other beings are here exerted
<PB N="13" REF="032069_0011_0FF10F46E8960F78">
in vain. "My coun&s;el &s;hall &s;tand, and I will do all my plea&s;ure"&mdash;"I work, and who &s;hall let it?" &mdash;is his own language on this &s;ubject. None can let, i. e. hinder, his work. Every dictate of that coun&s;el, however minute, will be exactly accom|pli&s;hed. The&s;e declarations, true as applied to all things, have a peculiar ground of truth as applied to the righteous. He, who attends &s;o minutely to &s;parrows, as to number their days, and limit their lives by exact bounds; who &s;uffers not a hair of our heads to fall without his providence; knows perfectly, that righteous men, rational, im|mortal, and de&s;tined to dignified employments and endle&s;s happine&s;s, are of more value than ma|ny &s;parrows. Rai&s;ed by their character, endow|ments, and &s;ervices, to that rank of being, in which he vouch&s;afes to call them his friends, they are had in everla&s;ting remembrance. No mo|ment fleets through the reign of time &s;o rapidly, no period rolls &s;o di&s;tantly in eternity, as ever to occa&s;ion them to be forgotten. Every thing which they do, and every thing which they need, is fre&s;h in the Infinite Mind; the former will be certainly and bountifully rewarded; the latter will be punctually and amply be&s;towed.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. That the Righteous are di&s;po&s;ed of with equity.</P>
<P>"Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?" is a que&s;tion, carrying its an&s;wer in it&s;elf to the con&s;cience and conviction of every con&s;iderate man. Inju&s;tice finds here no room for admi&s;&s;ion, even in thought. The proofs of the ju&s;tice of a par|ticular&punc; di&s;pen&s;ation, indeed, may not, and often will not appear; but the proofs, that all, which is done by God, is done with perfect ju&s;tice, are too plain, and too conclu&s;ive, to need a refutation.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="032069_0012_0FF10F93458252F8">Scarcely more nece&s;&s;ary is it to mention the amazing importance of this con&s;ideration. The terrible effects of inju&s;tice, even in an earthly rul|er, are &s;o dreaded by all men, as to create, when|ever they appear, the greate&s;t agitation and di&s;|tre&s;s. No human convul&s;ions have more &s;haken, or a&s;toni&s;hed, the world than tho&s;e, which have chiefly originated from this cau&s;e. Thrones have been &s;ubverted, rulers de&s;troyed, oceans of trea|&s;ure expended, and oceans of blood poured out, to avert, or to remedy, the evil.</P>
<P>On known and exact ju&s;tice all men, on the contrary, wholly and comfortably rely for &s;uch deci&s;ions and mea&s;ures, as are mo&s;t intere&s;ting to their wellbeing. All men al&s;o, who are not them&s;elves unju&s;t, acquie&s;ce in &s;uch mea&s;ures and deci&s;ions, as are &s;een to be ju&s;t; nor can a higher commendation be given, nor a more im|portant duty required of him, who ruleth over men, than that <HI>he</HI> is, or <HI>mu&s;t be, ju&s;t ruling in the fear of God.</HI> So high a place, indeed, does the virtue of ju&s;tice, or righteou&s;ne&s;s, hold, that it is perhaps, as often as any other, made to &s;tand as a de&s;cription of all that is virtuous. The Text is one example, and the pages of Scripture teem with innumerable others.</P>
<P>In the Infinite Ruler this glorious attribute claims an infinite di&s;tinction. From all the in|ju&s;tice of earthly rulers, as well as from private wrong, there is beyond the grave, a final appeal. There a tribunal is erected, at which, there a Judge exi&s;ts, before whom, every wrong, &s;uffered here, will be redre&s;&s;ed, and every right denied or wre&s;ted here, will be &s;ecured. Fraud may here plunder, lu&s;t pollute, ambition en&s;lave, and cruel|ty torture; but the victim will there find a com|plete
<PB N="15" REF="032069_0013_0FF10F610AC82990">
remedy for his wrongs, and an ample recom|pen&s;e rendered into the bo&s;om of his enemies. The poor, the deluded, and the &s;uffering, will there be gloriou&s;ly exalted, and the proud man fall, and the mighty man be brought low before them. This is the final &s;olace for every pre&s;ent wrong, the refuge, the home, of the per&s;ecuted and oppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>But from that tribunal there is no appeal. Whatever deci&s;ions are there given will be ulti|mate deci&s;ions. No future, wi&s;er, ju&s;ter judge is yet behind, to revi&s;e and correct the errors there committed, or to redre&s;s wrongs there in|flicted. Eternity is written on every &s;entence, and immutability in&s;tamped on every allotment. How dreadful, beyond mea&s;ure, in this ca&s;e would be inju&s;tice? inju&s;tice remedile&s;s and hopele&s;s? Through what a duration would it extend, with what knowledge would it be contrived, with what power would it be enforced? The Creation would be one great pri&s;on, clanking with the chains, and echoing the groans, of agony and de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Again&s;t all the&s;e wrongs, again&s;t every wrong, all creatures are by the perfect ju&s;tice of God wholly &s;ecured. The Righteous, particularly, neither in their death, nor in their future being, will find a right invaded, or an injury done. The determinations of God will command their entire approbation, and reflect the highe&s;t glory on his government. To all that he orders, and to all that he does, Wi&s;dom and Virtue will &s;ubjoin their &s;olemn Amen.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. That they are di&s;po&s;ed of with wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>By this ob&s;ervation I intend, that in the di&s;po&s;al of the righteous valuable ends are propo&s;ed and ac|compli&s;hed. No caprice, prejudice, or pa&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="16" REF="032069_0014_0FF0D3ACACDF0B98">
is indulged or gratified. On the contrary, with a complete knowledge of all that is practicable, nece&s;&s;ary, or de&s;irable, and a di&s;po&s;ition to pur&s;ue that, and that only, which is mo&s;t de&s;irable, a plan is formed and pur&s;ued, by which, in the mo&s;t direct manner, the purpo&s;e will be certainly brought to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>The ends, which are here in view, re&s;pect both the individuals, who are the immediate &s;ubjects of the di&s;po&s;al, and their fellow creatures, and un|doubtedly are found both in the pre&s;ent and the future world.</P>
<P>We are not u&s;ually able to trace with preci&s;ion the ends, which are by the&s;e di&s;pen&s;ations to be accompli&s;hed, in the pre&s;ent world; yet we have &s;ufficient rea&s;on to believe, that &s;uch ends are re|ally in view, and are actually accompli&s;hed. All events, here, lead to tho&s;e, which follow them; and they to others, in perpetual progre&s;s. In &s;ome ca&s;es we are able, at lea&s;t in an imperfect de|gree, to perceive the connection and de&s;ign. This, however, can never be done, until the events re|ferred to, have taken place. The fore&s;ight of man reaches but a little di&s;tance, and that di&s;tance in a manner very imperfect. Future objects are involved in mi&s;t and ob&s;curity; and the human eye, when it &s;ees them at all, &s;ees them in delu|&s;ive colours, and of forms and &s;izes, which mock detection, and elude inquiry.</P>
<P>The wi&s;dom, virtue, friend&s;hip, in&s;tructions, and example, of a righteous man obviou&s;ly pro|duce, after his decea&s;e, greater effects on tho&s;e, whom he leaves behind him, in many in&s;tances at lea&s;t, than the &s;ame cau&s;es produced, when he was living. Dying words are always affecting words; and the in&s;tructions of a righteous man,
<PB N="17" REF="032069_0015_0FF10F6327856A98">
who has left the world, po&s;&s;e&s;s the character, and the power, of dying words. They are remem|bered with more care and &s;olemnity, and felt with greater force, than when he was alive. When he was pre&s;ent and acting with us, when his in|tere&s;ts at times cla&s;hed, or were thought to cla&s;h, with ours, when by his example he ca&s;t a &s;hade on our conduct and character, and when with his voice he reproved and re&s;trained our faults, we naturally became impatient, cool, unfriendly, and prejudiced. His worth in our minds was le&s;&s;en|ed, or denied; his in&s;tructions doubted and di&s;re|garded; and his per&s;on viewed with di&s;like, and even with malignity. But when he is gone, our prejudices cea&s;e. We call to mind his excellen|cies with a more candid &s;pirit, and view his con|duct without the intervention of &s;elfi&s;h intere&s;ts. Many things, which in his life he &s;aid, and did, and which were then unfavourably received by us, are now acknowledged to be true, ju&s;t, and important. His whole character becomes thus more amiable and excellent in our view, and com|mands more exten&s;ively our reverence and imita|tion. From one righteous man the tran&s;ition is ea&s;y to others, and to all; and from them our re|&s;pect is naturally extended to their di&s;tingui&s;hing attribute. Righteou&s;ne&s;s, which makes them the peculiar objects of our regard, becomes it&s;elf more valuable in our eyes; and gives birth to a train of &s;entiments in our minds, which not unfrequently grow into reformation and excellence of life.</P>
<P>This is but one of the numerous important ends, accompli&s;hed in this world by the removal of the righteous. Not unfrequently are they removed from this world, that they may be taken away from the evil to come. From &s;in and temptati|on,
<PB N="18" REF="032069_0016_0FF10F55B5E9A2C0">
from toil and &s;orrow, from the degeneracy of their children and the mi&s;eries of their friends, from the &s;ufferings of their country and the per|&s;ecution of the church of Chri&s;t, a deliverance un|&s;peakably de&s;irable is granted to them by the in|finitely merciful God. Their bodies re&s;t from their labours in the peaceful grave, and their &s;pi|rits, a&s;cending to the man&s;ions of eternal quiet, gain a &s;imilar relea&s;e from the bondage of &s;in. From every &s;nare, and every enemy, they finally e&s;cape, and calumny, inju&s;tice, and envy, follow them with eyes vainly malignant, and with cur&s;es that roar unheard and unregarded.</P>
<P>When per&s;ons of high eminence for talents and virtue have long acted a con&s;picuous part on the &s;tage of life, and appear to be nece&s;&s;ary to the well-being of mankind, God not unfrequently intends, when he calls them away, to &s;hew the &s;urviving world, that he is perfectly able to carry on the de&s;igns of his providence without their agency. The importance of individuals to the &s;y&s;tem of things ri&s;es, at times, too high in the public e&s;ti|mation, and prompts us to forget the all-&s;uffici|ency of God, in the &s;trong &s;en&s;e we entertain of the excellence of men. This, though a natural, is an unhappy error, and is often be&s;t eradicated by the removal of tho&s;e, who have innocently and virtuou&s;ly contributed to its exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>In many in&s;tances he teaches us in an affecting manner, that we have regarded the decea&s;ed with affections undue and unwarrantable. Good men can be loved too much. Among the numberle&s;s idols of the human heart, they, not unfrequently, find a place. To love them is felt to be ju&s;tifia|ble, and known to be commanded. The mind, con&s;cious of rectitude in this indulgence of affec|tion,
<PB N="19" REF="032069_0017_0FF10F6A2B864DB0">
is frequently inattentive to the danger of in|dulging it to exce&s;s. A darling child, a venerat|ed parent, a beloved hu&s;band, or wife, &s;teals, in|&s;en&s;ibly, the heart from God; and often renders the return difficult, perhaps impo&s;&s;ible, without a removal of the idolized object.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time the contrary evil is not le&s;s frequent, or unhappy. The value of righteous men is often un&s;een, neglected, and de&s;pi&s;ed; their &s;ervices are requited with obloquy and unkind|ne&s;s; and their per&s;ons are made the objects of hatred, abu&s;e, and per&s;ecution. No inhabitant of Sodom was probably le&s;s e&s;teemed, or befriended, than Lot; and no I&s;raelite of his time than Eli|jah. From men thus di&s;po&s;ed the righteous are removed, in judgment. Nor is the judgment le&s;s, becau&s;e it is unregarded, or regarded with plea&s;ure. The death of a good man, which is con&s;idered by us as a benefit, will on that account prove the more certainly a cur&s;e. The hardne&s;s of heart, which is thus manife&s;ted, is of all cur&s;es the mo&s;t dreadful, and by the very event, which excites our plea&s;ure, is &s;urely and dreadfully increa&s;ed.</P>
<P>This detail might be ea&s;ily extended beyond the limits of your patience. The in&s;tances already mentioned are &s;ufficient to illu&s;trate the point in di&s;cu&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Of the particular ends, de&s;igned at in the fu|ture world, by the removal of good men from this, we know nothing. A general exhibition, only, is made to us in the &s;criptures, of the &s;tate of be|ing beyond the grave. From this we are a&s;&s;ured, that their tran&s;lation to that world is intended to accompli&s;h purpo&s;es, in the highe&s;t degree impor|tant and de&s;irable. None, there, are idle, or u&s;e|le&s;s; but all are far more active, able, and u&s;eful,
<PB N="20" REF="032069_0018_0FF10FA8164A2570">
than they could have been here. Superiour pow|ers, directed to &s;ublimer objects, and actuated by more excellent di&s;po&s;itions, are there engaged in nobler exertions, and more dignified employments. To the&s;e exertions, and employments, they are di|rectly &s;ummoned by their Maker, and enter upon a career of more di&s;tingui&s;hed u&s;efulne&s;s to them|&s;elves, their fellow creatures, and their God, which will know no end</P>
<P N="5">5. That they are di&s;po&s;ed of with kindne&s;s and mercy.</P>
<P>We know, &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, that all things do work (or labour) together, for good to them that love God; to them who are the called, according to his purpo&s;e. This is the end of the united labours of all beings, and all events, of God, and of good and evil beings in his creation. In the hands of a Being, who has contrived, and who is directing, all things for this glorious end, tho&s;e who love him cannot but find un&s;peakable good will manife&s;ted in every employment, and in eve|ry concern.</P>
<P>From this world of toil, of &s;orrow, and of &s;in, they are removed forever. No more &s;hall their &s;trength be wa&s;ted by wearine&s;s, their health im|paired by langour and pain, or their comfort and peace de&s;troyed by enemies and dangers. No more &s;hall their eyes be pained by the &s;ight of families corrupted, perver&s;e, and hopele&s;s; of friends ali|enated from God, religion, and life; and of a world in guilt and ruin. No more &s;hall they be called to war with lu&s;t, to &s;truggle with tempta|tion, or to endure the &s;tings of &s;corn, the &s;hafts of malice, or the iron hand of oppre&s;&s;ion. Their hearts &s;hall no more be wounded by con&s;cious guilt, and &s;hameful back&s;liding. When they take
<PB N="21" REF="032069_0019_0FF10F585E95E520">
their flight from this great pri&s;on, they will bid a final adieu to every enemy and evil, and &s;ee the di&s;tance between them&s;elves and their enemies widening forever. Toil, pain, &s;orrow, fear, and death, time, temptation, and &s;in, recede from their flight, and the tumult roar, and rage, behind them in vain.</P>
<P>In the mean time they a&s;cend to God, and re|turn to their final home. In his children they find none but friends, from his hand no commu|nication but of love, and in his hou&s;e nothing but joy. With expanded minds, and purified hearts, with &s;trength incapable of decay, and activity &s;u|periour to fatigue, they enter on a cour&s;e of enjoy|ment perpetually enlarging. Ran&s;omed of the Lord, returned and come to Zion with &s;ongs and everla&s;ting joy upon their heads, they are acknow|ledged as &s;ons, and kings, and prie&s;ts, to God the Father, and live and reign with him forever and ever.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e, whom they leave behind them, will, if informed with the evangelical &s;pirit, and regarding the &s;olemn di&s;pen&s;ation with attentive wi&s;dom, &s;hare in the kindne&s;s, of which their decea&s;ed friends &s;o largely partake.</P>
<P>The grave of a good man is one of the mo&s;t in|&s;tructive of all earthly objects. We there behold the end of the cour&s;e even of virtuous life; of wi&s;|dom as well as of ambition; of worth as well as of wickedne&s;s. The humble origin of man is there traced in our kindred to corruption, to worms, and to du&s;t. There we &s;ummon up to &s;olemn view the trials, the labours, and the excellencies of him who is gone; the patience with which he bore affliction, the fortitude with which he en|dured danger, the re&s;olution with which he &s;ur|mounted
<PB N="22" REF="032069_0020_0FF10F95A8813B70">
difficulties and vanqui&s;hed enemies, the peace with which he heightened enjoyment, the faith with which he quickened diligence, the hope which gleamed through the gloom of de&s;pond|ency, and the prayers which invoked and drew down from heaven the &s;upporting energy of the Infinite Spirit. What objects can &s;o intere&s;t, en|lighten, quicken, and &s;u&s;tain? In what other place can the&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;s equal influence?</P>
<P>From this affecting &s;cene we al&s;o lift our eyes to the di&s;tant, invi&s;ible world, and trace our de|parted friend far on his final and glorious flight, ha&s;tening to the endle&s;s reward of all his labours, &s;ufferings, and virtues. We &s;ee him e&s;caped from every danger, and victorious over every enemy. The conflict is pa&s;&s;ed; the day is won; and the palm of eternal triumph awarded.</P>
<P>Here, more than in any other place, we learn &s;o to &s;truggle, endure, and overcome. Here we learn to lean upon the God, on whom he has leaned, and to tru&s;t in the Saviour, in whom he has tru&s;t|ed; to de&s;pi&s;e the world, which he has proved to be vanity, and to &s;eek the inheritance, which, end|le&s;s and &s;incere, he has &s;ought, and obtained. In a word, heavenly mindedne&s;s, the ornament and beauty of virtue, is a plant, which eminently flou|ri&s;hes and blo&s;&s;oms around the grave of a righte|ous man.</P>
<P>To the affecting occa&s;ion, which has called us together, the&s;e ob&s;ervations are &s;o naturally appli|ed, that my audience have probably anticipated me in making the application. We are called to|gether, my friends and brethren, to follow to the hou&s;e, appointed for all living, a wi&s;e and righte|ous man. In his death each of us finds an affect|ing concern. To one is mo&s;t &s;trongly pre&s;ented
<PB N="23" REF="032069_0021_0FF10F9FF3CED910">
the image of a departed friend; to another of a departed mini&s;ter. One will mo&s;t deeply regret an obliging neighbour, another a prudent coun|&s;ellour, a third a lo&s;t benefactor, and a fourth a &s;piritual guide. All naturally form their claims upon the preacher; and their claims he feels and acknowledges. The demand is too ju&s;t, and the occa&s;ion too affecting, to be unfelt by any heart, not wholly unacquainted with feeling.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e, who are mo&s;t deeply concerned in the departure of the Decea&s;ed, the &s;urviving Family claim our fir&s;t regard. To them he &s;tood in mo&s;t of the important relations, in which he is remembered by others; and in &s;ome, in which he was known to them only; relations peculi|arly important and endearing. To them, there|fore, to the bereaved widow, and her mourning children, to the brethren, &s;i&s;ters, and other near relatives, let me fir&s;t addre&s;s the in&s;tructions and con&s;olations of the text.</P>
<P>While you, Madam, your Children, and your near Connections, are mourning the lo&s;s of this beloved Friend, to you and your children the be&s;t of all friends, God only excepted; while your more di&s;tant Connections around you &s;tand uniting their &s;orrows with yours, and mingling with your tears their own tears of &s;ympathy; let me, who&s;e of|fice it now is, attempt to admini&s;ter to you, and to your fellow mourners, &s;uch con&s;olations, as your di&s;tre&s;&s;es will permit. Imperfect they may be; but they may &s;till be found of real u&s;e.</P>
<P>The heart, when &s;orely wounded, is, I am well aware, ready to revolt at the thought even of con|&s;olation. In &s;uch a ca&s;e, the words of Thomas are but too naturally adopted, "Let us go al&s;o, that we may die with him." Still the &s;criptures
<PB N="24" REF="032069_0022_0FF10F6654B289C8">
furni&s;h comfort in every di&s;tre&s;s. The con&s;olati|ons, which they give, are the con&s;olations of God, who knows perfectly the nature of the wound which he has made, and who, in his Word, has mercifully provided a bal&s;am to a&s;&s;uage its an|gui&s;h. Be mine the ta&s;k to point it out to you, to induce you to u&s;e it, and to aid you to po&s;&s;e&s;s your&s;elves of its healing power.</P>
<P>To this purpo&s;e no con&s;iderations are, unle&s;s I greatly mi&s;take, more naturally, or effectually a|dapted, than tho&s;e &s;ugge&s;ted by the text. When events deeply and &s;orely affect us, it is no &s;mall &s;upport fully to realize, that they are contrived, cho&s;en, and accompli&s;hed, by the infinite God; that, though my&s;terious in them&s;elves to &s;uch &s;hort&s;ighted creatures as we are, though contrary to our wi&s;hes and expectations alike, and though oppo&s;ed to all which we &s;hould think proper to be done, there is &s;till in them nothing of chance, of caprice, or of enmity to us. The con&s;ideration ri&s;es &s;till higher, and our &s;upport becomes &s;till &s;tronger, when we call to mind, that this de&s;ign and its accompli&s;hment are directed by perfect e|quity; and that the di&s;pen&s;ation, when &s;crutiniz|ed by the &s;tricte&s;t eye, mu&s;t be approved of as perfectly right. Still more plea&s;ingly mu&s;t we be affected, when we remember, that con&s;ummate Wi&s;dom conducted the event, pur&s;ued import|ant ends, and &s;elected this as a nece&s;&s;ary mean of promoting them; and that &s;uch ends may be re|alized by our&s;elves, if we wait with patience, ex|amine with care, and act with wi&s;dom and piety. But our con&s;olation will be mo&s;t effectually found, when we further remember, that the &s;ame event is the fruit of infinite kindne&s;s and mercy to our|&s;elves and ours.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="032069_0023_0FF10F5AAD8676F8">All the&s;e &s;upporting con&s;iderations attend the death of a righteous man, and all the circum&s;tan|ces of his death. It may be &s;udden, awful and peculiarly painful to the human eye. He may die, far from his family and friends; and they may be prevented of the power, and fru&s;trated of the wi&s;h, to attend him in the la&s;t moments, and to do for him the la&s;t kind offices. All the&s;e are unavoidably di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to us; but every one of them, however unaccountable it may &s;eem, is contrived and executed by God with entire wi&s;|dom, ju&s;tice, kindne&s;s, and mercy. The Lord doth not willingly afflict the children of men; but, as a father pitieth his children, &s;o the Lord pitieth them that fear him.</P>
<P>Say not then, my &s;uffering friends, that your cup is filled with bitterne&s;s only. Bitter indeed it is, but it is &s;till &s;weetened with mercy. Think what would be your &s;ituation, if you were now mourning, as tho&s;e mourn, who have no hope. Call up to view the image of a gracele&s;s hu&s;band, of an unprincipled father, of an abandoned bro|ther, and compare it with the character of him whom you have lo&s;t. How affecting the contra&s;t? How incalculably different might your &s;ituation have been; how un&s;peakably more pungent and agonizing your &s;orrows? In your remembrance nothing ri&s;es, but the prudence, the care, the in|&s;truction, the kindne&s;s, of the friend, the father, and the hu&s;band; the wi&s;dom, the piety, and the dignity, of the chri&s;tian, and the mini&s;ter. What a train is here pre&s;ented to the mind? Who, when called to mourn, would not choo&s;e &s;o to mourn?</P>
<P>All this, you will in&s;tinctively an&s;wer, is a mere de&s;cription of the greatne&s;s of our lo&s;s. Let me
<PB N="26" REF="032069_0024_0FF10F3C38BBD978">
reply. Could you wi&s;h the ca&s;e otherwi&s;e? Could you at this moment be willing, that one virtue le&s;s, or in any le&s;s degree, had entered into the character of the decea&s;ed?</P>
<P>In the mean time, let me exhort you not to forget ble&s;&s;ings, becau&s;e they are pa&s;t. How much longer than the common lot have you enjoyed the pre&s;ence, in&s;tructions, and kind offices of the de|cea&s;ed? How long has he formed, and increa&s;ed, conjugal happine&s;s; trained up his children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord; commanded his hou&s;hold to follow after God; and walked exemplarily before them in the &s;tatutes and ordi|nances of the Redeemer? How long, how faith|fully, and how uniformly, has he exhibited the benevolence of a friend, and a brother? Forget not, in the height of your affliction, &s;uch ble&s;&s;ings as the&s;e. Forget not, that they came from the &s;ame God, who has now called you to &s;orrow and tears.</P>
<P>Let me al&s;o exhort you affectingly to remember all tho&s;e amiable things in the decea&s;ed; who&s;e value you declare by the &s;orrow, with which you lament the lo&s;s of them, and to remember them as motives, as guides, and as an example, all prompting you to pur&s;ue the &s;ame de&s;irable con|duct. "Go thou, and do likewi&s;e," is the in|&s;truction, which &s;hould clo&s;e the account, and the remembrance, of every virtuous example. An ex|ample &s;o near, &s;o beloved, cannot want motives to enforce it. All the ju&s;t, important, evangelical things, which the friend whom you mourn has &s;aid, and done, will now, as they ri&s;e in your view, appear inve&s;ted with a new force and &s;olemnity. They will come as in&s;tructions from the invi&s;ible world, and as an example from beyond the grave.
<PB N="27" REF="032069_0025_0FF10F9E54476FD0">
In this affecting character let them be heard, reve|renced and obeyed.</P>
<P>Commending you now to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them that are &s;anctified, &s;uffer me to direct my attention to the Congregation, over which the decea&s;ed has &s;o long pre&s;ided as a Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>My friends and brethren, you are bereaved of a friend, connected with you in a relation, which is plainly one of the neare&s;t and mo&s;t important in the pre&s;ent world. With the manner in which he has &s;u&s;tained this relation, and di&s;charged the duties of it, to you, I am not, though a &s;tranger to you, wholly unacquainted. From his preach|ing and conver&s;ation, and from the information of others, I know him to have adopted the doctrines of grace; doctrines acknowledged as the true, doct|rines of Chri&s;t by the great body of tho&s;e, who, in every age and country, have been e&s;teemed or|thodox Chri&s;tians. In accordance with the&s;e doctrines he looked for &s;alvation for him&s;elf, his family, and his flock. The&s;e were the object of his un&s;haken attachment, and the &s;ubject of his fervent exhortations; were exten&s;ively under&s;tood by him, and ably defended. In the&s;e he lived, and in the&s;e he died.</P>
<P>From his mouth you have heard them weekly, and I need not tell you, with what ability, learn|ing, fervour, and uniformity, &s;et forth in full di&s;|play from the beginning to the end of his mini&s;try. In conformity to the&s;e doctrines you have ever been called to Faith and Repentance in the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and to the Love of God and man|kind. You have been taught, that man is a de|praved and ruined creature, condemned by the law
<PB N="28" REF="032069_0026_0FF10FA250F99C90">
of God, and with no means of return, or reconci|liation, in him&s;elf; that in Chri&s;t alone is your hope for forgivene&s;s, acceptance, and eternal life; that your &s;alvation is a reward not of works, but of the grace of God; that the faith of the Go&s;pel is Faith which worketh by love, purifieth the heart, and produceth every good fruit; and that by this Faith alone you are united to Chri&s;t, and intere&s;t|ed in the ble&s;&s;ings of his redemption.</P>
<P>All the&s;e are doctrines humbling to human pride, and wounding to human ob&s;tinacy. They lay man low at the foot&s;tool of divine mercy, and unclothe him of that &s;elf righteou&s;ne&s;s, which he thinks his ornament and glory, but which is in|deed a garment of rags, and a wreath of &s;hame. Nor le&s;s alarming are they to the fears, than hum|bling to the pride, of &s;inners. That quiet and &s;ecurity, in which a hard heart and a &s;tupid mind love to re&s;t, they di&s;turb and de&s;troy; and pre|&s;ent to impenitence nothing but danger, terror, and death.</P>
<P>Men who love to be at ea&s;e in Zion, and who cheri&s;h the pride and plea&s;ure of &s;elf righteou&s;ne&s;s, are u&s;ually enemies to the doctrines, which I have mentioned. While the&s;e doctrines, and the preachers of them, are a &s;avour of life unto life to them who are &s;aved, they are al&s;o a &s;a|vour of death unto death to them that peri&s;h. To many of the Congregation in this town, both living and dead, they have doubtle&s;s proved the means of life; to &s;ome, perhaps, they have &s;erv|ed only as means of awakening re&s;entment, oppo|&s;ition, hardne&s;s of heart, and final unbelief.</P>
<P>According to the&s;e doctrines the decea&s;ed lived before you; daily exemplifying their influence on his faith, and on his conduct. The example, which he &s;et, was the example of prudence, dili|gence,
<PB N="29" REF="032069_0027_0FF10F488162B4B0">
truth, ju&s;tice, kindne&s;s, and godline&s;s. In all the relations, of life he &s;hewed, that he believ|ed and lived, as he urged you to believe and live. You know, though I am ignorant, whether you received his words, as the words of a friend and a mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, or whether he has all the day long &s;tretched out his hands to a gain&s;aying and di&s;obedient people. Search your hearts, and en|quire what is the account, which you will &s;oon be obliged to give.</P>
<P>He is now gone; gone to the world of depart|ed &s;pirits; gone, we tru&s;t, to receive the appro|bation of his Lord, and the reward of a faithful &s;ervant. He is removed from your e&s;teem, your love, your kind offices, your communion and your knowledge. At the &s;ame time he is placed be|yond the reach of your re&s;entment, oppo&s;ition, and unkindne&s;s. Intercour&s;e between you and him has, in this world, cea&s;ed forever. But let me exhort you to remember, that you will meet again, and at the clo&s;e of a little period will &s;tand face to face. Both he and you will be called to give an account of his mini&s;try, and the manner in which it was received by you; of what you believed, and what you practi&s;ed. You will then meet with other views, and other feelings, than &s;ome, which you have been wont to experience here. Here many intere&s;ts, aims, pur&s;uits, prejudices, and pa&s;|&s;ions, of this world have occupied your minds, and greatly coloured and ob&s;cured your views of future things. But eternity will then have be|gun to you, and all the&s;e earthly things will have di&s;appeared. Pa&s;&s;ion and prejudice will then have cea&s;ed to operate, and truth naked and entire will be brought out to view.</P>
<P>At that time, tho&s;e of you, who have cordially received from his lips the in&s;tructions of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s,

will meet him with joy. His witne&s;s will redound to your everla&s;ting happine&s;s, and yours will be to him a crown of glory. He will ble&s;s God for giving you to him as a diadem of beauty, as an everla&s;ting crown which &s;hall never fade away; and you will ble&s;s the &s;ame God for giving him to you, as a mini&s;ter of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and the means of your &s;alvation. What a meet|ing will this be? What a progre&s;s will be made in friend&s;hip thus begun, a friend&s;hip to be en|larged and improved through an endle&s;s duration?</P>
<P>How different will be the interview between him and tho&s;e of you, &s;hould any &s;uch be found, who have rejected his words of truth? Are you prepared to alledge, before his Judge and yours, the rea&s;ons which induced you, when he called, to refu&s;e; and, when he &s;tretched out his hand, to di&s;regard; to &s;et at nought his coun&s;el, and to receive none of his reproof. Are you ready to declare to your Judge, that you hated this truth, kingdom, and character, de&s;pi&s;ed his grace, griev|ed his &s;pirit, accounted the blood of the covenant an unholy thing, and crucified afre&s;h the Lord of glory by your unbelief? Soon will you follow him to the grave, and be numbered, as he is, with the dead. Soon will you &s;tand before God, and give an account of every work done in the body, with every &s;ecret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil. This, of all con&s;iderations the mo&s;t affecting, the mo&s;t amazing, can never be more properly urged, or more happily realiz|ed, than on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. Let it not pa&s;s without &s;ome la&s;ting good to you. Think, I be|&s;eech you, how &s;oon you are going&mdash;to whom&mdash; on what errand&mdash;with what preparation&mdash;to what end.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="032069_0029_0FF10F3EF0D82680">You have lo&s;t a mini&s;ter, long &s;ettled over you in the things of the Lord. Many of you know not by experience either the difficulties, or the dangers, of &s;uch a &s;ituation. Mo&s;t of you have arrived at manhood &s;ince he commenced his min|i&s;try; many of you have been born &s;ince that pe|riod; and not a few have been baptized by his hand. In this &s;ituation &s;uffer a friend to you, and to your children, to &s;ugge&s;t to you a few intere&s;t|ing truths.</P>
<P>In former years you have been happily united; within a period of moderate length, I have been informed, your union has been le&s;s perfect; in your pre&s;ent &s;tate it may become le&s;s perfect &s;till. A variety of cau&s;es, incapable of being fore&s;een by men, may lead a flock, without a &s;hepherd, to &s;catter and to &s;tray. But if di&s;united, you can be neither virtuous nor happy.</P>
<P>To prevent this &s;ore evil, let me, not wholly unexperienced in ca&s;es of this nature, exhort you to mark any, who may attempt to cau&s;e divi&s;ions among you, and to avoid them. Cultivate, with &s;edulous care, peace and good will in your neigh|bourhoods. In all your affairs conduct your&s;elves with calmne&s;s, with deliberation, without pa&s;&s;ion, and without ha&s;te. Shun hard &s;peeches. Watch, with alarm, the beginnings of party &s;pirit; and remember, that the fruit of righteou&s;ne&s;s is &s;own in peace, of them that make peace.</P>
<P>Carefully regulate your families, and punctual|ly pre&s;erve your family wor&s;hip. Train up your children for God, and walk before them in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blame|le&s;s. Make your hou&s;es hou&s;es of God, and your families families of piety, peace, and love. As your public privileges are le&s;&s;ened, prize your pri|vate ones more.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="032069_0030_0FF10F5DCEAF9908">Continue the public wor&s;hip of God among you, without ceasing, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> a neglect of the Sabbath by &s;hutting the doors of his hou&s;e. Inattention will &s;oon grow into negligence, negli|gence will &s;oon be confirmed into a habit, and that habit will &s;oon become an evil which cannot be cured.</P>
<P>Recal to mind, as far as you can, the ju&s;t and evangelical things, which from time to time have been &s;aid to you by your decea&s;ed pa&s;tor; lay them up in your hearts, and practi&s;e them in your lives.</P>
<P>As &s;peedily as you can, ree&s;tabli&s;h among you the mini&s;try of the Go&s;pel. Seek an evangeli|cal mini&s;ter, who will not &s;hun to declare to you all the coun&s;el of God. Such an one will, in|deed, declare to you many painful and humiliating things; but they will &s;till be the things of God, and will make you and yours wi&s;e unto &s;alvation.</P>
<P>In your clo&s;ets a&s;k daily of God his direction and ble&s;&s;ing. Prayer, offered with &s;incerity and faith, was never offered in vain. If you will thus a&s;k, he will give, and give liberally without up|braiding.</P>
<P>Finally, my beloved brethren, be ye &s;tedfa&s;t, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord; and remember, that your labour &s;hall not be in vain in the Lord.</P>
<P N="3">3. Let me now addre&s;s the &s;ubject to the Mi|ni&s;ters of Chri&s;t who are pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>My beloved brethren, a great man is fallen in our I&s;rael to day; a man of di&s;tingui&s;hed learning and under&s;tanding, of unu&s;ual prudence, and of &s;ingular &s;kill and experience in the concerns of congregations, churches; and mini&s;ters. Recom|mended by tried wi&s;dom, he was, as you well
<PB N="33" REF="032069_0031_0FF10F5F61DBE478">
know, very exten&s;ively employed, and confided in by both mini&s;ter and people, throughout the &s;tate. By both were his u&s;eful labours acknowledged in compo&s;ing their differences, and directing their intere&s;ts. To you, to me, to all with whom he was connected, the lo&s;s is great and affecting. In the congregations, in the churches, and e&s;pe|cially in the Univer&s;ity, of this &s;tate, every weigh|ty concern will remind us of his important &s;ervi|ces, and force us to feel what we have lo&s;t. His talents were not only great and di&s;tingui&s;hed, but they were al&s;o of that mo&s;t u&s;eful kind, which we call practical. Such talents are eminently fitted for the &s;ervice of God, and for u&s;efulne&s;s to man|kind. In whatever he was called to judge, or act, he made it his fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s thoroughly to ex|amine, and fully to under&s;tand. This he accom|plished by diligent &s;crutiny, clo&s;e attention to both &s;ides of di&s;putable points, a careful inve&s;tigation of principles, and a cautious con&s;ideration of con&s;e|quences. For this important bu&s;ine&s;s his thorough knowledge of the human character qualified him in an eminent degree, as did al&s;o his &s;trong pow|ers of judging, and his peculiar coolne&s;s and &s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Not le&s;s important were his attention, patience, and per&s;everance, in inve&s;tigating. In the&s;e mo&s;t u&s;eful things he was at once an emi|nent ble&s;&s;ing to mankind, and a mo&s;t profitable example to us. No man living probably &s;o well under&s;tood the intere&s;ts of our Univer&s;ity, or for more than twenty years took &s;o active and import|ant a part in its concerns. Few &s;o well knew the intere&s;ts of our churches, or &s;o ably and &s;o exten&s;ively &s;erved them. I tru&s;t his &s;ervices will be, by us at lea&s;t, gratefully remembered.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="032069_0032_0FF10F689F1D9768">God has now taken him from us in the full &s;trength of all his powers, and at the height of his u&s;efulne&s;s. Let this di&s;pen&s;ation be, at once, a &s;olemn monition to us of our own approaching di&s;&s;olution, and of our duty to imitate his diligence. Let us be quickened by it to faithfulne&s;s, zeal, and con&s;tancy, in the &s;ervice of our Ma&s;ter. Times like the&s;e furni&s;h a mini&s;ter with abundant em|ployment, and demand of him unu&s;ual diligence, faithfulne&s;s, and fortitude. The indu&s;try of infi|dels, their per&s;everance, their fanatici&s;m, pre&s;ent to us a powerful &s;timulus to equal, if we cannot excel, them in con&s;tancy and exertion. Long has it been a ju&s;t and melancholy complaint, that vile men are more a&s;&s;iduous in their labours, than vir|tuous men; and that a bad cau&s;e is u&s;ually &s;u&s;|tained with more vigorous and unremitted efforts, than a good one. Let us endeavour, that this &s;hall no more be truly &s;aid, where we are engaged. Troubles and dangers, in&s;tead of di&s;couraging, ought only to quicken our re&s;olution, faithfulne&s;s, and zeal. They that are with us are more, and mightier, than they that are again&s;t us. For di&s;|couragement there is no room; for exertion there is abundant. When our fathers and brethren are taken away, their labours devolve on tho&s;e, whom they leave behind. Let us re&s;olutely take up the burden, and God will give us &s;trength to carry it. What will give us boldne&s;s and peace in the pre|&s;ence of Chri&s;t at the judgment? What, but faith|fulne&s;s in his &s;ervice?</P>
<P>We &s;hall indeed meet with rebuffs and &s;coffs, with obloquy and oppo&s;ition. But to us the&s;e things are of no real con&s;equence. God is far more &s;lighted, abu&s;ed, and reviled, than we are. In the &s;ame manner was Chri&s;t treated; and in a
<PB N="35" REF="032069_0033_0FF10F4B43BD7560">
degree un&s;peakably more gro&s;s and injurious. Like him, let us &s;et our faces as a flint again&s;t all oppo|&s;ition, and he will &s;upport and ble&s;s us. Let us be con&s;tant and unwearied in our prayers and la|bours, and we &s;hall certainly be heard and pro&s;|pered.</P>
<P N="4">4. I will now clo&s;e the di&s;cour&s;e with an ad|dre&s;s to this numerous A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>The Friend, the Mini&s;ter, who&s;e remains are &s;hut up in yonder coffin, a few days &s;ince was liv|ing and acting in the mid&s;t of you, his neighbours, his friends, and his flock. He has fini&s;hed his earthly cour&s;e, and has been &s;ummoned by his Ma&s;ter to the invi&s;ible world to give an account of his &s;teward&s;hip. He will not return to you, but you will &s;oon go to him. You will &s;oon clo&s;e your eyes in the iron &s;leep, will inhabit the dark and narrow hou&s;e, will become the prey of corruption, and the fea&s;t of worms. Your bodies will be mingled with the common du&s;t, and be changed into the cold clod of the valley. But they re&s;t not here. There is beyond the grave a re&s;urrection to immortal being.</P>
<P>How vain, how momentary, is your pre&s;ent life, when viewed as a period of enjoyment for a rea&s;oning mind? How important and &s;olemn, as a period de&s;tined to &s;ecure the attainment of end|le&s;s virtue and happine&s;s? On it, tran&s;ient and vi|&s;ionary as it is, hang heaven and hell, immortal glory and excellence, and interminable wretched|ne&s;s and depravation. A&s;k the fir&s;t hoary head, which you meet, and he will tell you, that his own protracted years are, in his view, a vapour, which has appeared for a little time, and is now vani&s;h|ing away; that, compared with that ocean of e|ternity, on the &s;hore of which he now &s;tands,

<P>A&s;k your&s;elves how you will feel, and what ap|pearance you will make, when your bodies, at the call of the Archangel, and the trump of God, &s;hall &s;pring from the grave, when bone &s;hall rejoin its bone, when the frame &s;hall be clothed with fle&s;h, when the Spirit of God &s;hall breathe upon the lifele&s;s ma&s;s, and cau&s;e it to awaken into endle&s;s exi&s;tence; and when you, together with the un|numbered millions of the great family of Adam, &s;hall again &s;tand upon your feet, as an army of in|comprehen&s;ible multitude?

<P>THE Reader will probably not be di&s;plea&s;ed with a &s;hort account of the life of Doctor Goodrich. Doctor Goodrich was born of a reputable family in the pari&s;h of Stepney, in Wethersfield, Octo. 26, O. S. 1734; He received his literary education at Yale-Col|lege, was admitted to the degree of Bachelor of Arts A. D. 1752, and to that of Ma&s;ter of Arts A. D. 1755, and was the &s;ame year appointed a Tutor in that &s;eminary. In 1756, Nov. 24, he was ordained pa&s;tor of the Church and Congregation at Durham; and, in 1776, was cho&s;en a member of the Corporation of Yale-College. Nov. 17, 1797, he &s;et out from his hou&s;e on an annual vi&s;it to the Collegiate Lands in the County of Litchfield. The following Sabbath he preached at Litchfield, and on Monday rode to Nor|folk. He lodged at the hou&s;e of Capt. Titus Ives, and went to bed in his u&s;ual health and cheerfulne&s;s. In the morning he ro&s;e early, and, having partly dre&s;s|ed him&s;elf, fell upon the floor in an apoplectic fit, and expired, in the 64th year of his age, and the 42d of his mini&s;try. His remains were brought to Durham on the &s;ucceeding Saturday, and followed to the grave by his Family, Church, and Congregation, and a numer|ous

As a &s;cholar he comprehended the circle of the liberal arts and &s;cien|ces. He excelled in the languages, in Latin, Greek and Hebrew; in the Mathematics, and in Philo&s;ophy; but Divinity was his peculiar &s;tudy. As a Chri&s;tian Divine he was &s;olid, judicious, e&s;tabli&s;hed with grace; equally free from the wildne&s;s of enthu&s;ia&s;m and the rigors of &s;uper&s;tition. His reading was exten&s;ive, his memory tenacious, his piety &s;ub&s;tantial, his gravity commanding; <HI>his profiting appeared unto all men, and his prai&s;e is in all the churches.</HI> He was a wi&s;e coun|&s;ellour and peacemaker, a friend and lover of his coun|try, and of mankind."</P>
