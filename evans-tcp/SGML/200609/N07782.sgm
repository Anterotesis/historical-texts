<ARGUMENT>
<HEAD>Introduction, or the Preface.</HEAD>
<P>GIVE audience all ye people, hear my words, O ye wi&s;e men, give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge; for the ear tryeth words, as the mouth ta&s;teth meat: Hear me therefore, O ye mothers in I&s;rael, and children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.</P>
<P>Suffer me a little and I will &s;hew you that I have yet to &s;peak in behalf of God and my country.</P>
<P>But fir&s;t I have an apology to make to the reverend doctors of divinity and others who may di&s;pute my authority to undertake a matter of &s;uch im|men&s;e importance; being one of <HI>Zebulun,</HI> or of the &s;ea-fareing tribe, who&s;e calling is upon the mighty waters, quite remote from the royal prie&s;thood.</P>
<P>To &s;uch I an&s;wer with the language of Elibu the &s;on of Barachel the Buzite, when he waited for an an&s;wer from riper age, to reprove Job; I thought days &s;hould &s;peak, and multitude of years teach wi&s;dom; but when I had waited, they &s;pake not, but &s;tood &s;till, and an&s;wered no more: Then I tho't I would an&s;wer my part by &s;hewing my opinion; for I am full of matter, and the &s;pirit within me con&s;traineth me to &s;hew my opinion, morally, as I am no Dr. of divinity; yet am I a dear lover of morality, in its cleare&s;t &s;hining light, being de&s;titute of which, no man can make any preten&s;ions to that which is divine.&mdash; And without intruding upon gentlemen of that holy order, I &s;hall proceed to &s;peak to the words &s;elected out of &s;acred hi&s;tory for our pre&s;ent entertainment; &mdash;Which you may find written,
<Q><BIBL>EXODUS, xxxii chap. 7th &amp; 8th ver&s;es,</BIBL>
<P>And the Lord &s;aid unto Mo&s;es, get thee down, for thy people which thou broughte&s;t out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted them&s;elves; they have turned a&s;ide quickly out of the way which I commanded them, they have made a molten calf, and have wor&s;hipped it, and &s;acrifi|ced thereunto, and &s;aid, the&s;e be thy gods O I&s;rael, which have bro't thee up out of the land of Egypt.</P></Q></P>

<P>IN &s;peaking unto which words, I &s;hall enquire into and explain the words of the text in regard to primitive times, and compare the time

pre&s;ent with them, to &s;ee how nearly they agree in regard to moral con|duct, and draw a few inferences from both, and apply them to your &s;erious con&s;ideration; and conclude with a word or two of advice to all concerned in affairs of immen&s;e importance. And,</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. My brethren it would be tautology in me to rehear&s;e the hi&s;tory of the patriarch Mo&s;es to you, knowing you, or mo&s;t of you to be the children of pious parents, well educated, and bro't up in the fear of the Lord, as I look upon none of you to be ignorant of the birth, child|hood and education of him; you have read, and your parents have told you the many wonders wrought by Mo&s;es, in bringing his brethren out of the land of Egypt, and out of the hou&s;e of bondage, (he being en|dowed with a &s;trong and &s;incere regard for the I&s;raelites, and pity for all under that heavy yoke) how that in honour, truth and fidelity, he led his countrymen until he came to Mount Sinai, where he was called of God up into the Mount, and commenced lawgiver from the King of kings; and as this is the highe&s;t pitch of honor that can be conferred upon man, I &s;hall omit &s;aying any more of the patriarch Mo&s;es, but enquire into what happened in his ab&s;ence from the people.</P>
<P>Mo&s;es, in his ab&s;ence, left the care of the people to Aaron, for their guide: The poor people mi&s;&s;ing their fir&s;t leader, little tho't he was gone their prime mini&s;ter to the King of kings, and was con&s;ulting for their everla&s;ting welfare: Being ignorant of this, they a&s;ked Aaron to make them gods to go before them, for they didn't know what became of the man that bro't them out of the land of Egypt.</P>
<P>Aaron being fond of government, and not having the fear of God before his eyes, he yielded to the people's reque&s;t, made a calf, wor|&s;hipped and &s;acrificed thereunto; which is the corruption &s;poken of in my text, which kindled the anger of the Lord to &s;peak unto Mo&s;es in the manner he did, when in the mount, &s;aying, Get thee down, &amp;c. as in the text.</P>
<P>My brethren, having found the author and fini&s;her of the calf, let us enquire into the manner of their wor&s;hipping and &s;acrificing thereunto, in regard to which, I don't conceive that they had any &s;et modes of wor&s;hip, as at this day, for being left of God's teacher, they fell into all manner of error and confu&s;ion, &s;inging and dancing round their molten clalf, or calves (Indian like) proclaiming, <HI>The&s;e be thy Gods, O I&s;rael.</HI> This was the noi&s;e which Jo&s;hua heard, coming with Mo&s;es out of the mount, he &s;aid, <HI>It is not the voice of them which &s;hout for ma&s;tery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being over-come, but the noi&s;e of them that &s;ing, do I hear.</HI> This was their way of wor&s;hip, and their &s;a|crifice was much wor&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="009929_0005_0F7B3BF94EB88248"><HI>Every man brake off the golden ear-rings, which were in their own or their wives and childrens ears, and bro't them unto Aaron, and Aaron received them at their hands, and fa&s;hioned it with a graving tool; and after he had fini&s;hed the calf, he built an alter, and proclaimed a fea&s;t to the Lord, and the people brought burnt offerings and peace offerings, &s;at down to eat and drink, and aro&s;e up to play.</HI> Thus they went on until Aaron had &s;tripped them of every thing valuable, and made them naked to their &s;hame among their enemies.&mdash;But Mo&s;es drew near unto the camp, &s;aw their unwarrantable proceeding; he &s;aw the calf and the dance|ing, and his anger waxed hot; and he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire (perhaps a &s;acred bon-fire which they were danceing round) ready made, as I don't read that Mo&s;es kindled a fire for the purpo&s;e; and when he had burnt the calf, he ground it to powder, and &s;trowed it upon the water. Our text informs us that this corruption happen'd &s;uddenly, and contrary to God's command, which cau&s;ed many plagues to fall upon the people, (which I &s;hall not take notice of at pre&s;ent, as time would fail me): Therefore I mu&s;t ha&s;ten to compare the times pre&s;ent with the former. And</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. Can we find a Mo&s;es in this evil day which we live in? I an&s;wer, an equal to Mo&s;es upon, all accounts, is not to be found on earth, but yet we may find a man of a true patriarch &s;pirit, who may re&s;emble him in many things. And I think we may dare to nomi|nate &s;ecretary PITT to be our Mo&s;es, every way qualified, morally, as Mo&s;es was, to lead a people; being endow'd with honor, love, truth and fidelity; and in knowledge of things appertaining to this day, Pitt mu&s;t exceed Mo&s;es, (as Mo&s;es is not, neither doth any man know of his &s;epulchre to this day.)</P>
<P>However, Pitt was our prime mini&s;ter, under who&s;e mini&s;try we flouri&s;hed; he was the planner of every operation in time of war, which proved &s;ucce&s;sful to us in the&s;e American wilds: When he was at the helm our country-&s;hip was well &s;teared; the hearts of the people were made glad, and rejoiced in &s;ongs of victory and tri|umph over their barbarous and &s;avage enemies, the Indians, and their a&s;&s;ociates, the French natives of Canada, and the borders adjacent: By the ble&s;&s;ing of God, and Pitt's &s;uperior knowledge and prudent management of affairs in America, the howling wilderne&s;s was &s;topped in immen&s;e &s;ilence; and a period was put to the mo&s;t in|humane ma&s;&s;acres, which was &s;o frequently heard of among&s;t us.</P>
<P><PB REF="009929_0006_0F7B3BF9D1926DA8">Thus the dark, gloomy, melancholly &s;cenes were over, and every thing &s;eemed to appear with a &s;miling a&s;pect in all quarters of the world, as well as in North-America. Thus &s;ecretary PITT, taking Mo&s;es of old for his example, conducted gloriou&s;ly, which will re|down to his honour in ages to come.&mdash;But O poor Americans, thy friend being fatigued with the noi&s;e of a corrupt &s;et of people, left the helm to the &s;teerage of E&mdash;l B&mdash;e, who is an emblem of the primitive Aaron, leading the people into all manner of cor|ruption; as I &s;hall indeavour to demon&s;trate by what happened &s;oon afterwards: For as Aaron led the people into corruption &s;oon after Mo&s;es went into the Mount, &s;o B&mdash;e is &s;aid to lead the people into mi&s;chief, (&s;oon after Pitt leaves the helm) by his bad &s;teer|age, &amp;c.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner B&mdash;e takes hold of the helm but there is a wide dif|ference in government, every action which &s;hould tend to promote the freedom of Britons, is mo&s;t notoriou&s;ly made u&s;e of to en&s;lave and plague them.</P>
<P>What happens to us in this day, may be &s;aid to be wor&s;e than Egyptian bondage, for the Hebrews had nothing to &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon, of their own, while in bondage, and therefore could expect nothing but to labour hard for a livelihood: But with us my brethren, it is not &s;o; for we had won by conque&s;t, and had great things in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. But alas! what we &s;eemed to have is taken away from us, and gave to the enemies of Britain&mdash;all the conque&s;t and victories gained in the We&s;t-Indies, which were of an immen&s;e value, to|gether with the free cod fi&s;hery; (which was of as much or more con&s;equence to them than their Romi&s;h creed; for without fi&s;h they could not perform the articles of their belief); all this and more, given up to the nations which waged war again&s;t us, in a time when we were under no obligations to make peace with, (on any terms) much le&s;s in&s;ignificant ones.</P>
<P>I &s;ay given up without any valuable con&s;ideration, for mere no|thing that I can &s;ugge&s;t, but only to have it &s;aid by our enemies that &s;lavery becomes Britons more than the enemies to Britain: (who it was that &s;o craftily befriended the Romi&s;h e&s;tabli&s;hment it's hard for any one to &s;ay; but I am well a&s;&s;ured that &s;ecretary Pitt had but little or no hand in it; &s;uffer me to tell you, that the whole
<PB N="7" REF="009929_0007_0F7B3BFA8D672700">
we&s;tern world feels the effects of the maugre terms of peace); I call them maugre, becau&s;e we are like to be &s;tarved and cut &s;hort of allowance by the means&mdash;See impo&s;ition upon impo&s;ition is crowded upon us; and to crown all corruption, the ST&mdash;PM&mdash;N is coming among us, who is an emblem of the molten calf, made by Aaron of old in the wilderne&s;s; &s;ee the manner of his coming, and the errand come upon, and you will join with me in &s;enti|ments that he is the bea&s;t &s;poken of in my text, and who&s;oever wor&s;hips or &s;acrifices unto him will be brought to nakedne&s;s and &s;hame, as the Hebrews was of old.</P>
<P>The criticks will perhaps quere, How a man can be an emblem of a bea&s;t? To &s;uch I an&s;wer, That I don't mean in bodily &s;hape, but he may be &s;aid to be like unto a bea&s;t by having a bea&s;tly di&s;po&s;ition; as indecency, ingratitude, &amp;c. is &s;aid to be bruti&s;h (in man): and we read
<Q>That man in honour abiding not, is like the bea&s;t that peri&s;h.</Q>
If this be true, this very identical St&mdash;pm-n was cho&s;en repr&mdash;ive to this colony, he was honour'd and prefer'd before any of his function, he was &s;ent on an important errand to England; his grand de&s;ign and bu&s;ine&s;s was to pre&s;ent the colony's humble thanks to the king and parliament, &amp;c. of Great-Britain, for their paternal care over us in the late war, and thankfully to ac|knowledge every in&s;tance of favour received from them by the co|lony; al&s;o to repre&s;ent the true &s;tate of the con&s;titution of the government; and to make known the extreme poverty which we were reduced to by the calamities of a long war, and our inability of making a meet re&s;titution for their goodne&s;s at pre&s;ent (any more than as dutiful &s;ubjects ought, &s;o do we, po&s;&s;e&s;s hearts full of gra|titude.)</P>
<P>He al&s;o was to pray for the continuation of our rights and liberties, as at the fir&s;t, and for the &s;ecurity of our properties as at the begin|ing, without the lea&s;t encroachment on our charter: But my bre|thren, upon his arrival in Europe, he inhumanly forgot the place of his nativity, and (as it is laid) mo&s;t ungratefully betrayed the liberty of his country; and for the &s;ake of a po&s;t in the govern|ment, of no great value, he commenced executioner to the death warrant of it. As Eliphaz &s;aid to Job,
<Q>Should a wi&s;e man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the ea&s;t wind.</Q></P>
<P><PB REF="009929_0008_0F7B3BFB4F165DA0">Surely my brethren, the ear of that ea&s;tern world had a great effect upon him, his belly being filled with the ea&s;t wind, puffed him up with pride and arrogancy, that he thought him&s;elf and coun|trymen rich as Cae&s;ar, forgetting the important errand of the go|vernment's humble addre&s;s; uttering &s;welling words of vain know|ledge, when in company with the B&mdash;efy'd gentry, &s;aying, that the colony was able to bare taxation, &amp;c. joined with them in kil|ling his country, and commenced executioner him&s;elf, to &s;erve his countrymen, as he &s;ays. (But as executioner you mu&s;t mind) O coun|try kill country, O calf, bea&s;t, and antidote again&s;t liberty. For it is not po&s;&s;ible that he can be the man which was cho&s;en to repre|&s;ent our cau&s;e, and plead for our freedom; but thou art the bea&s;t that is returned with a yoke of bondage to put upon our necks, &s;aying we are able to bear all this and more, uttering &s;welling words of vain knowledge, by mi&s;repre&s;entations and wrong calcu|lations, filling our papers full of the confu&s;ion and noi&s;e of the brute.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of coming home with an&s;wers of peace, lenity and good will towards us, he comes inhumanly with a variety of &s;t&mdash;p duties, and very deeply laden'd with impo&s;itions upon us, proclaiming &s;a|crifice, &s;acrifice unto me, according to the decree pa&s;t, bring your &s;ilver and your gold, (for I know not the paper money of your co|lony); if you are de&s;titute of hard money, you mu&s;t bring the extra|vagancy of your colony. O daughters of Connecticut, you mu&s;t &s;acrifice your gold beads, jewels, ear-rings, &amp;c. until you are made bare and naked to your &s;hame (for the bea&s;t's &s;ake) for the calf or &s;t&mdash;pm-n will make &s;terling of all.</P>
<P>O <HI>Connecticut, Connecticut,</HI> where is your charter boa&s;ted of for ages pa&s;t (if the bea&s;t is wor&s;hipped your charter is void) and the government put upon the bea&s;t's &s;houlder (who is an ill bred bea&s;t nur&s;ed and brought up to devour you) which mu&s;t be acknowled|ged by every friend to liberty and property.</P>
<P>By comparing, I find the times pre&s;ent to be in &s;ome mea&s;ure parallel with the former, if there is any difference it is again&s;t us, we being more impo&s;ed upon than our fathers.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t proceed to draw a few inferences from what has been &s;aid.</P>
<P N="1"><PB REF="009929_0009_0F7B3BFC84138888">I&s;t. From what we have heard we may learn the humane frailty of man, and when I am exclaiming again&s;t others, I do not excu&s;e my &s;elf, for I am &s;ubject to many; we not only learn the humane frailty of man, but al&s;o the folly of laying too much &s;tre&s;s or dependance on his conduct: Applied to this colony, hath it not been the ca&s;e in regard to the St&mdash;pm-n? I hope not entirely &s;o: if it hath been the ca&s;e, I don't wonder that he proves a cur&s;e to us rather than a ble&s;&s;ing;
<Q>For it is written, cur&s;ed is man that tru&s;teth in man, and that maketh fle&s;h his arm.</Q>
But lea&s;t I &s;hould go beyond my &s;phere I mu&s;t &s;tick to morality.</P>
<P>And,</P>
<P N="2">IIdly, We may learn from the train of impo&s;itions received from the mother country, the folly in glorying in the roa&s;t beef of Old England, &s;ince we are &s;o notoriou&s;ly flog'd with the &s;pit: A little &s;upe-maugre with contentment, is preferable to roa&s;t beef and plumb pudding, &s;ince we are like to pay &s;o dear for the roa&s;t.</P>
<P>For being called Engli&s;hmen without having the privileges of Engli&s;hmen, is like unto a man in a gibbet, with dainties &s;et before him, which would refre&s;h him and &s;atisfy his craving appetite&punc; if he could come at them, but being debarr'd of that privilege, they only &s;erve for an aggravation to his hunger.</P>
<P>O my poor brethren in the gibbet of America, that cannot come at the dainties of Europe, I pity you with all my heart and &s;oul.</P>
<P N="3">IIIdly, Have we learn'd that corruption is at the helm, and that our country &s;hip is badly &s;teered? This al&s;o teaches us that the watch mu&s;t be called and the helm relieved by a better man.</P>
<P>O PITT, is it your watch upon deck? (turn out) take the helm from B&mdash;e, for he hath nigh over &s;et us at times: he hath carried &s;uch taught &s;ail in the &s;quals of impo&s;itions that our &s;ails are wore thread-bare: See the hurricane of &s;tamp duties coming on, &s;hor|ten &s;ail timely, down with top-gallant-ma&s;t, yards and &s;ails of pride and vain glory, in with all &s;mall kites, and &s;ee every thing &s;nug to &s;tand the &s;torm, like a bold &s;eaman, (bend new cour&s;es to the yards) and for God's &s;ake don't lay us a-troy, for we have been tried &s;ufficiently. If the gale comes on very hard put before the wind, for the &s;afety of the &s;hip and our lives. Scud her manfully

until the pernicious gale is over and the mountainous &s;ea of cor|ruption is ran down, or is broken to pieces by a gentle breeze of liberty, ari&s;ing to refre&s;h our wearied &s;ouls, which have been &s;o long fatigued with the thoughts of approaching &s;lavery.</P>
<P N="4">IVthly, Have we found a calf to be &s;acrificed to, in this our day? Let us all, every living &s;oul here pre&s;ent, or that lives with|in the precinct, or of hearing the noi&s;e of the bea&s;t, take example by that worthy patriarch Mo&s;es of old, and make a &s;acrifice of the calf, rather than to &s;acrifice thereunto&mdash;Burn it in the fire, grind it to powder, and &s;trow it upon the ocean, that the fi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">y nautiou&s;ne&s;s of the bea&s;t may be clean&s;ed from the earth, and that our plagues and impo&s;itions may not be made wonderful.</P>
<P>Time would fail to tell you of Shadrech, Me&s;hach and Abed|nego in the fiery furnace, Daniel in the lion's den, and many other worthies, who have been faithful in bearing te&s;timony again&s;t unju&s;t decrees, &amp;c. and have been protected by heaven in it their cau&s;e being ju&s;t in the &s;ight of God.

<P>A word or two of advice to all concerned in this affair of grand importance, and I have done.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t of all, my brethren, my advice to you is, to fear God above all things, honour and love the King and his friends, dete&s;t and loath his enemies, e&s;pecially his private ones: If you &s;ee or hear of any corruption in his mini&s;try, bear te&s;timony again&s;t it; for it is trea&s;on in &s;ubjects for to keep &s;ilent when they &s;ee their prince di&s;honour'd; and if by wrong repre&s;entations of any corrupt per&s;on or per&s;ons his &s;ubjects become grieved, impoveri&s;hed or cut &s;hort of their li|berty or privileges, let &s;uch &s;ubjects make known their grievance that they may be relieved, for what&s;oever tends to the poverty of &s;ubjects, by means of the enemies to freedom, is a di&s;grace to a monarch&punc; For poor &s;ubjects cannot make a rich king.</P>

<P>Go, one and all, go to &s;uch a man, and make him &s;en&s;ible of his error, if he will be convinced of his folly (forgive him) but if he wilfully per&s;i&s;ts in his wickedne&s;s, u&s;e him in &s;uch a manner that he will be glad to conform to the truth; and if he is in any po&s;t that unju&s;tly grinds the face of the poor, or that contributes to your &s;lavery, a&s;k him peaceably to re&s;ign it, and if he refu&s;es to, u&s;e him in &s;uch a manner that he will be glad to do any thing for a quiet life, For Britons never mu&s;t be &s;laves. And as we read, that
<Q>he which being often reproved, hardeneth his neck &s;hall &s;uddenly be de&s;troyed, and that without remedy,</Q>
Therefore take care of Mr. St&mdash;pm-n, alias the molten calf. AMEN.</P>
