to enable them to pay &s;ix dollars on each &s;hare, the board of managers granting their obligation to the &s;aid parties of the fir&s;t part to repay the &s;aid advances out of the fir&s;t monies they may receive thereafter on account of the company, except &s;uch as the &s;aid board are obliged by article the fourth to pay to per&s;ons recovering again&s;t the board, and al&s;o excepting the monies re&s;erved for a con|tingent fund, and in order to &s;ecure the performance on the part of the &s;aid parties of the fir&s;t part; they do hereby agree to depo&s;it in the hands of the tru&s;tees each three thou&s;and &s;hares or actions, making in all nine thou&s;and &s;hares to be held by them for the u&s;e of Robert Morris, John Nichol&s;on and James Greenleaf, re&s;pectively &s;ubject however to the payment of &s;uch &s;um or &s;ums on any or e|very year during the continuance of this company as may be nece&s;&s;ary to enable the board of managers to pay a divi|dend of &s;ix per cent. and they are hereby authori&s;ed to &s;ell and transfer &s;o many of the &s;aid &s;hares as may be needful for that purpo&s;e, in ca&s;e the &s;aid Robert Morris, John Ni|chol&s;on and James Greenleaf or &s;ome of them their, or &s;ome of their heirs, executors or admini&s;trators fail to provide by other means the &s;ums nece&s;&s;ary; the &s;ums of money ari&s;ing from &s;uch &s;ales of depo&s;ited &s;hares to be in the fir&s;t in|&s;tance applied to the payment of the dividend, and after|wards the &s;ame &s;ums to be replaced from the company's
