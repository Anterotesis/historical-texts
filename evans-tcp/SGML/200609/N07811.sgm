<P>And of the children of I&s;&s;achar, which were men that had under&s;tanding of the times, to know what I&s;rael ought to do, the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their commandment.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_ACCORDING to the original con&s;titution of the Hebrew polity, "each tribe was under it's own proper and di&s;tinct government; and order'd it's affairs by it's own princes, heads of families, elders and courts". At the &s;ame time, there was a union of all the tribes, the whole con|gregation had a right to meet together, either per&s;onally or by their repre&s;entatives, to con|&s;ult the common good and the pro&s;perity of the whole.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="009964_0005_0F7B3C608BB55850">After the death of Saul there &s;eems to have been a breach in this general union. The tribe of Judah &s;et up David to be king, the other tribes adhered to I&s;hbo&s;heth the &s;on of Saul. I&s;hbo&s;heth being dead, the other tribes, &s;en&s;ible how prejudicial &s;uch a di&s;union was to their common intere&s;t, by mutual con&s;ent made David king over all I&s;rael. This was done, it's like, by a con|vention of the &s;tates from each province, or an a&s;&s;embly of the heads of each tribe.</P>
<P>David had long before I been anointed, by a &s;pecial commi&s;&s;ion from God, to be king of I&s;rael. This was only an intimation from heaven of what would certainly take place. Neither David nor Saul before him claimed any authority in virtue of this divine appointment, until they were elected by the people, and &s;olemnly inaugurated in their high office.</P>
<P>Among others, who came to Hebron to make David king, were the children of I&s;&s;a|char, who appeared by the heads of the tribe; of the&s;e it is particularly &s;aid, they "were men that had under&s;tanding of the times, to
<PB N="7" REF="009964_0006_0F7B3C613B024708">
know what I&s;rael ought to do, they were in number two hundred, and all their brethren were at their commandment."</P>
<P>It is an excellent character that is given of the heads of I&s;&s;achar, and it was a &s;ingular favor to this tribe, that they had &s;uch a num|ber who were able to guide them at this cri|tical &s;ea&s;on.&mdash;You are told the good effect of their wi&s;dom and prudence, there was an entire union between them and the re&s;t of the community. They who were in government were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of talents which qualified them for their tru&s;t, and their brethren were &s;o &s;atisfied of their prudence and integrity, that they repo&s;ed an entire confidence in them, and &s;ubmitted to their authority without murmuring or oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>You have here the model of a happy, &s;tate: What a pro&s;pect of peace and la&s;ting pro&s;pe|rity, where rulers are wi&s;e and good, and the people are quiet and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive!</P>
<P>What I propo&s;e in the following di&s;|cour&s;e is,</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="009964_0007_0F7B3C63D6118170">Fir&s;t, To con&s;ider the character of a good ruler as it is drawn in the text. And then,</P>
<P>Secondly, To point out the duty of &s;ub|jects to their rulers.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing that pre&s;ents it&s;elf to our con&s;ideration, is the character of a good ruler. And in order to determine when men are qualified to govern, it is nece&s;&s;ary to take a general view of the great end of govern|ment.</P>
<P>It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that mankind would re&s;ign their natural freedom only for the &s;ake of pomp and appearance, much le&s;s to gratify the pride and avarice of tho&s;e they place in authority over them. The only rational view they can have is the common good. If men could &s;ub&s;i&s;t as well in a &s;tate of independency and ab&s;olute liberty, there is nothing in rea&s;on or con&s;cience to oblige them to &s;ubjection. The nece&s;&s;ity of go|vernment ari&s;es wholly from the di&s;advanta|ges, which, in the pre&s;ent imperfect &s;tate of human nature, would be the natural con&s;e|quence of unlimited freedom. This nece&s;&s;i|ty
<PB N="9" REF="009964_0008_0F7B3C649911C538">
is &s;o apparent that the mo&s;t &s;avage and barbarous of mankind have been convinced of it; and wherever they have formed them|&s;elves into &s;ociety, have erected &s;ome kind of government. In this &s;en&s;e all power is from God, as that con&s;titution, which makes go|vernment nece&s;&s;ary, originates with him who is the author of nature; and &s;uch a con&s;ti|tution is as certain an intimation of the di|vine will, as an expre&s;s revelation. There is no po&s;itive appointment or command; we argue the de&s;ign of heaven that there &s;hould be civil government, becau&s;e it is apparently for the advantage of mankind. "He is the mini&s;ter of God to thee for good".</P>
<P>If the public good is the great, the only end of magi&s;tracy; it follows that they only are worthy to be entru&s;ted with the powers of government, who know what the public intere&s;t is, and are capable of advancing it. The heads of every community &s;hould, like the heads of I&s;&s;achar, "have under|&s;tanding of the times, to know what I&s;rael ought to do".</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="009964_0009_0F7B3C65002DEDD0">This character &s;uppo&s;es, that rulers have a good degree of wi&s;dom and knowlege&mdash;That they are particularly acquainted with the con&s;titu|tion of the country they are called to govern&mdash; That they are men of virtue and religion&mdash; And that they have prudence to conduct af|fairs in &s;ea&s;ons that are critical and alarming.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. Wi&s;dom and knowledge are very nece&s;&s;ary qualifications of a public ruler. The ends of government will not be an&s;wer|ed by committing the admini&s;tration of af|fairs to one or more men, but by committing it to tho&s;e who are capable of di&s;charging the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them. The meane&s;t office requires talents &s;uited to that office, but when men are put in places of exten&s;ive authority, they ought to have exten&s;ive abi|lities.</P>
<P>Wi&s;dom and knowlege are &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for every one who has a &s;hare in govern|ment, that nothing can &s;upply their place. The experience of all ages evidences the ju&s;tice of that exclamation of king Solomon. "Wo to thee, O land, when thy king is a child!" If weak or ignorant men are entru&s;t|ed with power, what can you expect but
<PB N="11" REF="009964_0010_0F7B3C6669B4C9D0">
univer&s;al confu&s;ion! If men were not wi&s;e before, they are not like to become wi&s;e by being placed in a &s;tation of eminence. Such exaltation will rather make them giddy and vain, and deprive them of the little under|&s;tanding they had before.</P>
<P>If &s;uch magi&s;trates mean ever &s;o well, yet they know not how to execute their good purpo&s;es, and their admini&s;tration is like to be a &s;eries of the mo&s;t fatal errors. If they depend on others to manage the affairs of government, the event will not be better. Men of weak minds can &s;eldom bear the checks and coun&s;els of plain hone&s;t men, who know not how to di&s;gui&s;e the truth, or to &s;peak that which they do not think in their hearts. Para&s;ites and flatterers ea&s;ily gain their favor, who will &s;ooth their vanity, and accommodate them&s;elves to their foibles. And the &s;tate of &s;uch a people is often wor&s;e than where rulers are men of capacity, even tho' they are very deficient in their principles of action.</P>
<P>Bad men who can look to con&s;equences are often under the re&s;traint of fear, where
<PB N="12" REF="009964_0011_0F7B3C66DDCBEE00">
they have no other. They are aware of danger from the re&s;entment of an injured people, if they abu&s;e their power. But men without knowlege are devoid of &s;uch fears; and they who have the management of them endeavour artfully to conceal their own &s;hare in the public mi&s;conduct, and make u&s;e of the power with which they are ve&s;ted to gratify their ba&s;e and &s;ordid pa&s;&s;ions, to the ruin of the community, and often of tho&s;e who ve&s;ted them with it.</P>
<P>It is not every kind of genius or of know|lege that qualifies a man to govern. Many a one has made a &s;hining figure as a philo&s;o|pher or mathematician, who has had no turn for politics, and been intirely ignorant of the art of governing. It is frequently the ca&s;e, that great &s;cholars have no acquaintance with men, than which no branch of knowlege is of greater importance in a public ruler. It is nece&s;&s;ary to know the various tempers of tho&s;e he has to govern, to penetrate their particular views and intere&s;ts, and even their foibles and pa&s;&s;ions, that he may make them all &s;ub&s;ervient to the public good. It is nece&s;|&s;ary to di&s;cern their different talents and ca|cities,
<PB N="13" REF="009964_0012_0F7B3C6801A036C8">
that he may know whom to put into places of profit and tru&s;t, and may employ tho&s;e who are fit to be employed.</P>
<P>Is a ruler called to act the part of a legi|&s;lator? What need of a &s;ound and exact judgment, that the laws he makes may be good and whole&s;ome, accommodated to the temper and circum&s;tances of the people for whom they are made; and that while he endeavors to re&s;train vice and licentiou&s;ne&s;s, he may not unrea&s;onably infringe the liber|ties of the community?</P>
<P>When laws are made, it requires no &s;mall degree of under&s;tanding and of &s;tudy to en|ter into their true &s;pirit, to know how to ap|ply them in every ca&s;e that occurs, and to execute them with prudence and impartiality.</P>
<P>Where government &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, there mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily be burthens laid on the people to defray the charges of it. There is nothing that affects men more than when you touch their intere&s;t; people in general find it hard to procure the conveniencies of life; nothing will &s;ooner alienate their minds from go|vernment,
<PB N="14" REF="009964_0013_0F7B3C68BAE37080">
than when rulers needle&s;ly deprive them of that which they have dearly earn'd, and wantonly di&s;&s;ipate the public trea&s;ures. Rulers ought ever to proceed in this part of their duty with caution and prudence, that people may &s;ee the taxes they impo&s;e are not to gratify their pride, their avarice, or any other pa&s;&s;ion; not to carry on any private de&s;ign; but that they are nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of government and the exigencies of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>Every large community is con&s;tituted of a number of little &s;ocieties, in which there will be different branches of bu&s;ine&s;s. The&s;e, whatever pains are taken to prevent it, will have their different connections, and form &s;eparate intere&s;ts; it is va&s;tly difficult for tho&s;e who govern, to keep the balance &s;o exactly poiz'd that neither part may be in|jured; but much more, to prevent jealou&s;ies and &s;u&s;picions that things are carried by favor and affection.</P>
<P>The rulers of a people are &s;eldom &s;o hap|py as to plea&s;e all who are under their au|thority: They have often per&s;onal enemies;
<PB N="15" REF="009964_0014_0F7B3C6A4E09F6B0">
or crafty and ambitious men find fault with government becau&s;e they are not in place: They had need be wi&s;e as &s;erpents as well as harmle&s;s as doves to counterwork the machi|nations of &s;uch men, to give no occa&s;ion of offence to tho&s;e who &s;eek occa&s;ion, or to prevent the bad effect of the mi&s;repre&s;enta|tions they will indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t every &s;tate has it's neighbours, who watch for a favorable opportunity to encroach on it's territories, or to gain &s;ome other advantage. A ruler ought to keep a watchful eye over them, to get know|lege of their motions and de&s;igns; to pre|vent in&s;ult, or to re&s;ent it when offered. In the&s;e ca&s;es there is need of a thoro' acquain|tance both with their &s;trength and our own; that we may not by an ill-timed oppo&s;ition expo&s;e our&s;elves to greater injuries, or by mean &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions encourage them to de&s;pi&s;e and abu&s;e us.</P>
<P>A ruler who &s;uitably attends to the great end of government mu&s;t look beyond pre|&s;ent circum&s;tances, and carefully con&s;ider the tendency and conference of every mea&s;ure.
<PB N="16" REF="009964_0015_0F7B3C6B0F0BD268">
He cannot but be &s;en&s;ible how much the pre&s;ent times are affected by the tran&s;actions that are pa&s;t, and the precedents that have been e&s;tabli&s;hed. He will doubtle&s;s &s;ee that the community has received hurt from the mi&s;takes, as well as advantage from the pru|dence of tho&s;e who have gone before. He bears on his mind, that his admini&s;tration is like equally to affect tho&s;e that follow, and endeavours to take the whole intere&s;t of his country in view, the future as well as the pre&s;ent. He con&s;ults the good of di&s;tant generations, leaves as little as po&s;&s;ible for them to correct, and as far as human wi&s;dom can, lays his plans, not meerly to keep things quiet while he is on the &s;tage, but that the happine&s;s of his country may be of long duration, may be perpetual.</P>
<P>You ea&s;ily &s;ee by the&s;e hints of the bu&s;ine&s;s and duty of rulers, that every man is not fit to govern; there mu&s;t be a genius for government, and there mu&s;t be con&s;tant &s;tudy and application.</P>
<P>I have hitherto con&s;ider'd the wi&s;dom and knowlege which are nece&s;&s;ary for rulers in
<PB N="17" REF="009964_0016_0F7B3C6BC0D472B8">
general, and under almo&s;t every con&s;titution. Be&s;ides this,</P>
<P>Secondly, It is nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould have a particular acquaintance with the con&s;titu|tion of the country they are called to govern.</P>
<P>Rea&s;on we &s;ay dictates that there &s;hould be government; and the voice of rea&s;on is the voice of God. But what form of go|vernment they will be under is left to the choice of tho&s;e who are to be governed. God has never determin'd this. It becomes tho&s;e who claim a divine indefea&s;ible right, to make out their claim in a better manner than they have ever yet done, or it is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e any, who have common under|&s;tanding, or a tolerable &s;en&s;e of liberty, will &s;ubmit to it.</P>
<P>All power has it's foundation in compact and mutual con&s;ent, or el&s;e it proceeds from fraud or violence. Where the latter take place, the dominion which men claim is no better than u&s;urpation; and they, who by the&s;e methods rai&s;e them&s;elves above their brethren, are &s;o far from having a right to govern, that they ought to be puni&s;hed as
<PB N="18" REF="009964_0017_0F7B3C6CC9A5D170">
public di&s;turbers and the enemies of man|kind.</P>
<P>When government is founded in mutual con&s;ent, it is the undoubted right of the community to &s;ay who &s;hall govern them; and to make what limitations or conditions they think proper. Perhaps the &s;ame con|&s;titution is not be&s;t for all &s;ocieties, or for the &s;ame &s;ociety at all times. Be this as it may; it is very certain that mankind have e&s;tabli&s;hed different forms of government, according to their own will and inclination: "Some have &s;et up one or a few men to govern them, others have &s;een fit to retain the power them&s;elves:&mdash;In &s;ome the &s;upreme magi&s;trates have been annually elected; in others the power is for life. In &s;ome they are merely elective, in others hereditary under certain rules or limitations". In GREAT-BRITAIN there is a happy mixture of mo|narchy, ari&s;tocracy, and democracy. This is perhaps the mo&s;t perfect form of civil go|vernment. It is the glory of Britons and the envy of foreigners.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Is not England at pre&s;ent a proof of the goodne&s;s of mixed governments and temperate monarchies?

<P>We hope the great MONTESQUIEU is mi&s;taken, at lea&s;t that he &s;peaks of a very di&s;tant day, when he &s;ays of our happy nation.</P>
<P>"As all human things have an end, the &s;tate we are &s;peak|ing of will lo&s;e it's liberty, will peri&s;h. Have not Rome, Sparta, and Carthage peri&s;hed? It will peri&s;h when the legi&s;lative power &s;hall be more corrupt than the execu|tive."</P>

<P><PB N="19" REF="009964_0018_0F7B3C6D3AA8D0B0">But whatever form of civil government men have cho&s;e, there are certain con&s;titu|tions, which are the ba&s;is and foundation of the &s;tate, and which are obligatory on tho&s;e who govern, as well as tho&s;e who are go|verned. The&s;e con&s;titutions are a &s;ort of fundamental laws, which cannot be violated without the greate&s;t danger to a com|munity. When either part attempts to invade the rights of the other, it u&s;ually produces convul&s;ions, which &s;ooner or later overturn the &s;tate.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary they who are in authority &s;hould be well acquainted with the&s;e funda|mental laws; they ought to make them one main part of their &s;tudy; and &s;hould not without the utmo&s;t nece&s;&s;ity depart from them. If &s;uch a &s;trict adherence to the con|&s;titution is &s;ometimes attended with incon|veniences;
<PB N="20" REF="009964_0019_0F7B3C70520B8990">
yet a departure from it will be attended with much greater. Magi&s;trates ought to know their own power, and not tamely give up tho&s;e prerogatives with which the con&s;titution has ve&s;ted them. Such mean conde&s;cen&s;ion will only expo&s;e them to con|tempt and further encroachments, till not even a &s;hadow of authority is left. On the other hand, they ought to be tender of the privileges of tho&s;e they govern. Even in ab&s;olute monarchies, the people may by op|pre&s;&s;ion and tyranny come to know that they have rights, and to a&s;&s;ert them in a way not very plea&s;ing to tho&s;e, who have in&s;o|lently and unju&s;tly invaded them.</P>
<P>In free governments people are apt to feel much quicker. To touch their liberties is to touch the apple of their eye; every at|tempt alarms them, makes them jealous of further de&s;igns, and often throws them into the hands of factious demagogues, who hate government, and are ever watching for oppor|tunities to embarra&s;s public mea&s;ures, and to introduce anarchy and confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>Where &s;o much depends, and the danger of acting wrong is like to have &s;uch con&s;e|quences
<PB N="21" REF="009964_0020_0F7B3C7116716C20">
to the community, and perhaps to them&s;elves; rulers ought to know very well what it is to act right, where power ends and liberty begins. The more difficult it is to &s;ettle this point, &s;o much the more wi&s;dom and prudence do rulers need, and &s;o much the more cautious &s;hould they be in acting; and where people ob&s;erve &s;uch caution and tenderne&s;s in their rulers, they will make al|lowances for mi&s;takes, and even for faults.</P>
<P>I will not &s;ay, that they who are in go|vernment may not propo&s;e an alteration in the con&s;titution, when they &s;ee manife&s;t in|conveniencies; every member of the &s;tate may do this; and there may be extraordinary ca&s;es wherein it may be nece&s;&s;ary to deviate from common rules; in &s;uch ca&s;es the &s;afety of the people is to be preferred to every o|ther con&s;ideration. But no wi&s;e ruler would de&s;ire a general power of di&s;pen&s;ing with the laws; nor is it po&s;&s;ible to proceed with too much caution in making any great alteration in the civil con&s;titution of a &s;tate; e&s;pecially when it has been long e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the wi&s;dom of ages has been employed to confirm it. Where there &s;eem to be defects, there me|dy

may often prove wor&s;e than the di&s;ea&s;e; and by attempting to guard again&s;t one inconveni|ence, we may open the way to a great many which we do not now fore&s;ee. When a con|&s;titution is e&s;&s;entially bad, rulers &amp; every one el&s;e ought to run every ri&s;que to make it bet|ter. But where the con&s;titution is tolerably good, it is generally the wi&s;dom of tho&s;e in power, to maintain a &s;acred regard to it them|&s;elves; and to endeavour that it may not be violated by others. This is their &s;afety, and very often the &s;afety of tho&s;e they govern. When a humour of changing once begins, no mortal can tell where it will end. One can &s;carce conceive of an alteration more ju&s;t, more nece&s;&s;ary, and that could tend more to &s;ecure the public liberty, than the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of tribunes at Rome; and yet this very regulation, &s;eemingly &s;o wi&s;e and good, laid the foundation of the de&s;truction of their liberties, and the ruin of the common-wealth.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"The people by means of the tribunes, gradually u&s;urped the authority of the &s;enate.

<P><PB N="23" REF="009964_0022_0F7B3C7280E83938">Thirdly, Rulers cannot come up to the cha|racter of the text, unle&s;s they are men of re|ligion and virtue. Every condition has its temptations, none are expo&s;ed to more or greater, than tho&s;e who are advanced to &s;ta|tions of power and eminence; none have greater need of a &s;ettled principle of action, and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of divine grace. If there is no regard to God or the rules of vir|tue, wi&s;dom degenerates into cunning, and rulers in&s;tead of endeavouring to know what I&s;rael ought to do, only con&s;ider what they have to do them&s;elves; in&s;tead of aiming at the public good, they con&s;ult only what is like to promote their own private intere&s;t, &s;upport their admini&s;tration, and continue them in power. The &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ions will have the dominion; and men will &s;acrifice con&s;cience, and fell their country, to carry a favourite point, or gratify their vicious incli|nations. The intere&s;t of &s;uch rulers, or what they imagine to be their intere&s;t, pre&s;ently becomes &s;eparate from that of the commu|nity; of con&s;equence they are obliged to make u&s;e of every art, to keep the people quiet; to make them in&s;en&s;ible of their infe|licity, or to compel them to bear it; to put

a fal&s;e glo&s;s on their flagitious actions, or to &s;ecure a powerful party, who will &s;upport their mea&s;ures, and be the in&s;truments of their iniquity. They will choo&s;e tho&s;e for their companions and coun&s;ellors, who will flatter their vanity, feed their avarice, or provide for their plea&s;ures. The&s;e are the men they will endeavour to promote; whil&s;t they di&s;|regard per&s;ons of a different character, who feel for their country, and have courage to oppo&s;e tho&s;e mea&s;ures which tend to de&s;troy it. Vice contracts the mind, and quenches every &s;park of public &s;pirit; it fills the &s;oul with criminal prejudices, and the higher it is exalted, the mi&s;chief is &s;o much the more ex|ten&s;ive.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e is quite different when power is in the hands of men of virtue and religion.</P>
<P>By religion I intend &s;omething more than an external &s;hew, or a mere appearance of goodne&s;s. Hypocri&s;y is not only a character mo&s;t dete&s;table to God, but it makes a man more exten&s;ively mi&s;chievous to &s;ociety. His &s;anctimonious pretences procure him the e|&s;teem and confidence of his brethren, by
<PB N="25" REF="009964_0024_0F7B3C7400266420">
which means he has it in his power to deceive them, and to betray their intere&s;ts. No con|&s;ideration can be of force &s;ufficient to bind him, who dares to prevaricate with heaven, and to trifle with the Lord his maker. The greate&s;t prodigies of wickedne&s;s have been tho&s;e who have put on the gui&s;e of religion: For a pretence they have made long prayers, that they might, with the greater ea&s;e, accom|pli&s;h their dete&s;table de&s;igns. Nor do I call it religion to contend for a few little rites and ceremonies, which are of no importance in them&s;elves, and will not make men either wi&s;er or better. It does not con&s;i&s;t in nice metaphy&s;ical di&s;tinctions, and in loud and cruel anathemas again&s;t all who will not pro|fe&s;s to believe them. Much le&s;s is it religi|on to invade the rights of con&s;cience, and to inflict pains and penalties on tho&s;e who are not of the magi&s;trates &s;entiments, or pre&s;ume to di&s;&s;ent from the principles e&s;tabli&s;hed by law. On the other hand, no one can ima|gine there is any religion in a carele&s;s indif|ference about all principles; or in clamors for charity and forbearance, while malice reigns in the heart, and we can cen&s;ure, revile and per&s;ecute tho&s;e whom we e&s;teem le&s;s catholic than our&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="009964_0025_0F7B3C761C672610">I call that religion which Je&s;us Chri&s;t taught, and which is made known to us in the &s;acred oracles. It is a belief of the truth, and a temper of mind corre&s;pondent to it.</P>
<P>A religious man, or which is now the &s;ame thing, a &s;incere chri&s;tian, is purified in &s;ome mea&s;ure from tho&s;e corrupt principles, which too ea&s;ily find a place in the human heart, and is deeply penetrated with the things of God. He has a &s;upreme affection to this greate&s;t and be&s;t of beings, and maintains a con&s;tant regard to him in all his actions. He remembers the divine pre&s;ence and the ac|count every one mu&s;t give to this Lord and judge of all. He heartily &s;ubmits to Chri&s;t as his prince and &s;aviour: He has &s;ome de|gree of that mind which was in Chri&s;t Je&s;us: He de&s;ires to approve him&s;elf to him, and is animated by tho&s;e glorious pro&s;pects which the go&s;pel opens to our view.</P>
<P>The religion of Je&s;us enlarges the mind; it dive&s;ts us, &s;o far as it prevails, of every cri|minal prejudice; it makes us willing to deny our&s;elves, to &s;acrifice our worldly ea&s;e, our temporal intere&s;t&punc; to the honor of God and the
<PB N="27" REF="009964_0026_0F7B3C76BAD75EA8">
good of men. It fortifies again&s;t temptation, it curbs our pa&s;&s;ions, it regulates our de&s;ires, it produces noble and generous &s;entiments, it in&s;pires love and univer&s;al benevolence; it teaches us to look not every one on his own things, but on the things of others; not to confine our charity to our&s;elves, but to do good to all with whom we are con|nected, and e&s;pecially to aim at the public advantage, in which the comfort and happi|ne&s;s of multitudes are involved.</P>
<P>This chri&s;tian temper, which is produc'd by the Spirit of God, will more than any thing help us to di&s;tingui&s;h between right and wrong; when private intere&s;ts and pri|vate views are removed, "the public good appears naked and open, free from all diffi|culties and embarra&s;&s;ments". When rulers have &s;uch a happy di&s;po&s;ition, they will &s;tudy the true intere&s;t of tho&s;e they govern, which is the way to under&s;tand it; they will watch again&s;t a little party &s;pirit and every &s;elfi&s;h &s;ini&s;ter view; they will &s;uppre&s;s the dictates of pride, covetou&s;ne&s;s, and ambition; and while with a manly firmne&s;s they &s;upport their own dignity. they will not invade the
<PB N="28" REF="009964_0027_0F7B3C774B05BF30">
privileges of tho&s;e who are &s;ubject to them; they will not hearken to the in&s;inuations of flattery, nor meanly court the favor of the populace; they will not have re&s;pect to per&s;ons, nor take a gift; and will &s;evere|ly frown on tho&s;e, who have the in&s;olence to affront their virtue, or attempt to pervert their judgment. No motive, no temptation will allure them to join in making bad laws, or to wre&s;t the true intention of tho&s;e that are in force. Their whole ambition will be to di&s;charge their tru&s;t with fidelity, and to make the people happy who are un|der their care.</P>
<P>I own there are other principles which may have very &s;alutary effects. There is in &s;ome men a certain benevolence and great|ne&s;s of mind, which leads them to do many worthy deeds, that others perform from a principle of religion. There are remains of con&s;cience in men, who cannot be deno|minated &s;incere di&s;ciples of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Even their ambition and &s;elf-intere&s;t may prompt men to actions which are greatly beneficial to the community, and to di&s;|charge the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them with ho|nor
<PB N="29" REF="009964_0028_0F7B3C780B449908">
and fortitude. But the better the prin|ciple, &s;o much the greater, at lea&s;t &s;o much the more certain will be the effect. When the love and fear of God reign in the heart, men will ri&s;e to nobler heights, and to more di&s;tingui&s;hed acts of virtue, than from any other motive. When they con&s;ider the whole community as brethren, they will na|turally &s;eek the common good. When they &s;et before them the example of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, when they contemplate his ardent love to mankind and di&s;intere&s;ted benevo|lence, their minds will be inflamed with a holy ambition, to emulate the virtues of this amiable, this excellent per&s;on. When the greate&s;t men carry their thoughts to that im|portant hour, when they mu&s;t leave the&s;e tran&s;itory &s;cenes, and their honors will be laid in the du&s;t, how &s;ollicitous will they be that they may fini&s;h well, and have the ap|probation of their own minds, when they have nothing el&s;e to &s;upport them! When they look forward to that illu&s;trious day, in which the Lord will be revealed from hea|ven, and the great as well as the &s;mall mu&s;t &s;tand before his tribunal; what a check is this to every &s;ini&s;ter view and every iniqui|tous

practice! What an incentive to ju&s;tice, to integrity and univer&s;al virtue! If other qualities may render a ruler u&s;eful to &s;ociety, yet &s;urely nothing but religion, a regard to God in his public conduct, will en&s;ure him the acceptance of heaven, and the plaudit of the great ruler and judge of all.</P>
<P>I am far from &s;uppo&s;ing that religion is the only thing to be regarded in a ruler. The mo&s;t religious character will appear con|temptible in a public &s;tation, if there are not other accompli&s;hments: But whatever qua|lities a man has, it can by no means be &s;afe, to entru&s;t our lives, our e&s;tates, our liberties, every thing that is dear and valuable, to one who evidences by his conver&s;ation, that he has no regard to God, and is de&s;titute of vir|tue and goodne&s;s. What can we expect, but that he, who will &s;acrifice his own mo&s;t im|portant intere&s;t, will &s;acrifice the intere&s;ts of others, if at any time they are oppo&s;ite to his vicious inclinations?</P>
<P>Fourthly, Another accompli&s;hment very nece&s;&s;ary for a good ruler, is prudence to conduct affairs in &s;ea&s;ons that are critical and alarming. Such a &s;ea&s;on it was in I&s;rael
<PB N="31" REF="009964_0030_0F7B3C794C1FA728">
when I&s;hbo&s;heth was &s;lain. And then it was that the heads of I&s;&s;achar di&s;covered their under&s;tanding and addre&s;s, by conducting with &s;uch prudence as to &s;till every oppo&s;ite faction, and bring their brethren quietly to &s;ubmit to king David, which was the only expedient to &s;ave the kingdom from ruin. Affairs in a kingdom or in a province are &s;ometimes brought to a dangerous and im|portant cri&s;is, from foreign enemies or inter|nal tumults; from the mi&s;takes of tho&s;e who wi&s;h them well, or the intrigues of de|&s;igning men; from their own vices and fol|lies, or the wickedne&s;s of others. In &s;uch a critical &s;ituation, the friends of a people are called to ari&s;e, and to exert them&s;elves to &s;ave them from impending ruin. This mat|ter e&s;pecially belongs to tho&s;e who are in authority, the eyes of others are naturally to them, under that God who has the hearts of all men in his hand; from them they expect relief; and happy the people, who&s;e rulers have at &s;uch time wi&s;dom to di&s;cern, and virtue to pur&s;ue tho&s;e mea&s;ures, that tend to promote their welfare, and to prolong their tranquility.</P>

Tho&s;e of &s;u|perior character ought to have &s;uperior &s;teadine&s;s, in&s;tead of determining that no|thing can be done, they ought to enquire what is to be done; what they can do them&s;elves, and what I&s;rael ought to do. Some men are very happy in finding out expedients in the mo&s;t difficult ca&s;es; they know how to &s;teer in the mo&s;t tempe&s;tuous times; are able to counterwork tho&s;e who
<PB N="34" REF="009964_0033_0F7B3C7BA6A372F0">
&s;ecretly endeavor to undermine the &s;tate, or to give them a ju&s;t view of things, who are in danger of doing hurt for want of better information; to remove every un|rea&s;onable prejudice in the mind of tho&s;e, who have power to injure us; or to go|vern our tempers, and regulate our pa&s;&s;i|ons, that we may not de&s;troy our&s;elves. This is a talent very different from that wi&s;dom which is profitable to direct in a common &s;tate of things. A man may be a good pilot in a moderate gale, who can do nothing in a &s;torm. Some men who would make very good rulers in a time of pro&s;perity, are quite unfit to lead in times that are intricate and perplexed. They lo&s;e the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them&s;elves; they are ti|morous and irre&s;olute, and &s;o neglect to do what ought to be done; or they are ra&s;h and violent, and by their imprudence pre|cipitate the ruin they intend to prevent. It is of the greate&s;t importance that rulers have under&s;tanding of the times in &s;uch critical &s;ea&s;ons. While others are hurried by their fears and pa&s;&s;ions, and know not what to do, they ought &s;edately to con&s;ider the tendency and con&s;equences of pre&s;ent

<P>There is one cour&s;e, which if it will not be a certain cure, will yet be a great relief in the mo&s;t dangerous &s;tate we can be in; and that is the practice of piety and uni|ver&s;al virtue. Virtue does in it&s;elf tend to promote public happine&s;s. Frugality, temperance, indu&s;try will extricate us out of mo&s;t difficulties that can ari&s;e; and if we are actuated by religion, God will be our God, our protector, and friend; "it will be well with us and our children for ever." Whatever he does el&s;e, if a ruler has un|der&s;tanding in the times, he will promote the fear of God and obedience to his laws.</P>
<P>I have now con&s;idered &s;ome of the di&s;|tingui&s;hing qualities of a good ruler. It is not to be expected, in the pre&s;ent imper|fect &s;tate, that rulers will be free from mi&s;|takes or faults; whoever looks for &s;uch a behaviour from any man or from any &s;et of men, will undoubtedly be di&s;appointed.

But though you may not expect a perfect character, yet the great author of nature, who&s;e tender mercies are over all his works, "has thought fit to mingle from time to time among the &s;ocieties of men, a few of tho&s;e on whom he is graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to be&s;tow a larger proportion of under&s;tanding and integrity, than is given in the ordinary cour&s;e of his providence to the &s;ons of men. There are &s;uperior &s;pirits, men who are born to guide, to in&s;truct, and to pre&s;erve"; their abilities and their virtues denote that they were formed for the pub|lic good, and it would be a fault not to improve tho&s;e talents, with which the great Lord of all has entru&s;ted them. They ought not to let &s;lip any opportuni|ty that pre&s;ents to &s;erve their country, or to do good to mankind.</P>
<P>There are indeed arts and intrigues, by which &s;ome men intrude them&s;elves into &s;tations of dignity, which are below one of a great and generous mind, and which no con&s;ideration will per&s;uade him to make u&s;e of.

It might deprive &s;ocieties of the be&s;t heads and hearts, and leave them a prey to crafty and ambitious men, who&s;e only care would be to aggrandize and enrich them&s;elves. A true patriot cannot do his country a more important &s;ervice, than by taking it out of the hands of &s;uch devour|ing harpies.

From &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages as the&s;e, &s;ome have argued the doctrine of pa&s;&s;ive obedience and non|re&s;i&s;tance in all ca&s;es what&s;oever; or that we are not to oppo&s;e tho&s;e who are in authority, although they evidently act contrary to the de&s;ign of their in&s;titution, and are bent to ruin the &s;ociety, which it is their duty to defend and promote. A doctrine &s;o big with ab&s;urdity, that one would think no one of common under|&s;tanding could embrace it; certainly he mu&s;t have the temper of a &s;lave that can practice upon it.

<P>When rulers are wi&s;e and good, oppo&s;i|tion is an high crime; men ought not to make their own jealou&s;ies, re&s;entments, or private intere&s;t, a pretence for re&s;i&s;ting au|thority, or to &s;tir up factions and &s;editions again&s;t their rulers.

Experience &s;hows, that if they, who are ve&s;ted with power, have but a moderate &s;hare of public virtue, they are admired and honored while they live, and their memory is ble&s;&s;ed long after they are dead. Rulers therefore always have it in their power, to &s;ecure the people in their intere&s;t, and to gain a place in their hearts.

<P>It would be well, if both rulers and peo|ple would con&s;ider the brevity and uncer|tainty of human life, and that account which they mu&s;t all give of the things done in the body. What a happy influence would this have on their temper and conduct! It would lead rulers to improve every talent to the honor of God and the good of men. It would lead &s;ubjects &s;o far as is po&s;&s;ible, and as much as in them lieth, to promote peace and union. It would make us all &s;ollicitous to approve our&s;elves to God, and to get that &s;piritual un|der&s;tanding, which only can make us meet for the inheritance of the &s;aints in light.</P>
