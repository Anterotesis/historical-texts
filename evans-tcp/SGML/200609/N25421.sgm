<HEAD>THE LIFE OF CERVANTES.</HEAD>
<P>MIGUEL DE CERVANTES SAA|VEDRA, who&s;e writings have thrown a lu&s;tre over Spain, amu&s;ed Europe, and corrected his century, lived poor, unfortunate, and died almo&s;t forgotten; we were ignorant till with|in the&s;e few years, of the true place of his birth. Madrid, Seville, Lucene and Alcala, di&s;puted this honour with each other; thus Cervantes, like Homer, Camoens and many other great men, found &s;everal countries after his death, and wanted nece&s;&s;aries during his life.</P>

of its &s;overeign, has at length rendered the memory of Cervantes that homage which Spain has owed him for too long a time; they have publi&s;hed a &s;plendid edition of Don Quixotte. It &s;eemed as if they had believed that the magnificence of this publication could repair the injuries that the nation had done its author. His life is at the head, written after the mo&s;t exact re&s;earches, by a di&s;tingui&s;hed academician. I &s;hall follow this authority, as far as regards facts, permitting my&s;elf to &s;peak o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the works of Cervantes, according to the &s;entiments they have in&s;pired me with.</P>
<P>Cervantes was a gentleman, &s;on to Roderi|go Cervantes, and Leonora de Cortinas; he was born at Alcala de Henares, a city of new Ca&s;tile, the 9th day of October 1547, under the reign of the emperor Charles the fifth. From his infancy he loved books; he &s;tudied in Madrid under a celebrated profe&s;&s;or, where he very &s;oon &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t expert &s;cholars. The grand &s;cience of that time was latin and theology; the parents of Cervantes
<PB N="3" REF="033741_0005_0FF8F6AD2E979108">
intended to have made him an eccle&s;ia&s;tic or a phy&s;ician, the only lucrative profe&s;&s;ions in Spain; but he had &s;till this trait in common with many celebrated poets, of making ver&s;es in &s;pight of his parents. An elegy on the death of Queen I&s;abella de Valois, a number of &s;on|nets, and a little poem called "Filene," were his fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays; the &s;mall regard that they paid to the&s;e works appeared to him an inju&s;|tice, he left Spain, and went to &s;ettle at Rome, where di&s;tre&s;s forced him to become valet de chambre to Cardinal Aquaviva.</P>
<P>Di&s;gu&s;ted very &s;oon with an employment &s;o little fit for him, Cervantes became a &s;ol|dier, and fought with di&s;tingui&s;hed valour in the famous battle of Lepanto, gained by Don John of Au&s;tria, in 1571: he received there a wound in his left hand from a mu&s;quet, of which he was lame all his life;&mdash;as a recom|pence for this wound he was put into the common ho&s;pital at Me&s;&s;ina. Having left the ho&s;pital, the trade of an invalid &s;oldier ap|peared to him preferable to that of a de&s;pi&s;ed
<PB N="4" REF="033741_0006_0FF8F6AED19EAE60">
poet, he went and enrolled him&s;elf anew in the garri&s;on of Naples, in which city he re|mained three years. As he was repa&s;&s;ing in|to Spain on board a galley of Philip the Se|cond's, he was taken and brought into Algiers, by Arnaut Mami, the mo&s;t renowned of all the cor&s;airs.</P>
<P>Fortune, who exhau&s;ted her rigours upon the unfortunate Cervantes, could not wear out his courage;&mdash;&s;lave to a cruel ma&s;ter, &s;ure of dying in torments if he dur&s;t make the lea&s;t attempt to recover his liberty, he concert|ed his e&s;cape with fourteen Spani&s;h captives. They agreed to redeem one from among them&s;elves who &s;hould go to his own country, and return with a bark to carry the others dur|ing the night; the execution of his project was not very ea&s;y: it was nece&s;&s;ary at fir&s;t to get as much money as &s;hould pay for the ran|&s;om of one of the pri&s;oners, afterwards to e&s;cape from the hou&s;es of their different ma&s;ters, and be able to remain all together, without being di&s;covered, till the very mo|ment that the bark &s;hould arrive to carry them
<PB N="5" REF="033741_0007_0FF8F6B1ED305048">
away. So many difficulties appeared in&s;ur|mountable; the love of liberty brought it all about. A captive, a native of Navarre, em|ployed by his ma&s;ter in cultivating a large gar|den upon the borders of the &s;ea, took on him&s;elf the ta&s;k of hollowing out a cave in the mo&s;t retired part of the garden, capable of containing the fifteen Spaniards; he &s;pent two years in this work, during which time they gained, what with alms and hard work, the ran&s;om of a Majorcan, named Viane, who&s;e fidelity they were &s;ure of, and who knew per|fectly well all the coa&s;t of Barbary. The money being ready, and the cave being fini&s;h|ed, it was nece&s;&s;ary to wait yet &s;ix months be|fore every one was prepared to go there; then Viane ran&s;omed him&s;elf, and parted from them, having &s;worn to return in a little time.</P>
<P>Cervantes had been the &s;oul of the enter|prize; it was he who expo&s;ed him&s;elf every night in &s;eeking food for his companions; as &s;oon as day appeared, he retired into the cave
<PB N="6" REF="033741_0008_0FF8F6B66DBD0F88">
with provi&s;ions enough for the day. The gardener, who was not obliged to conceal him&s;elf, had his eyes continually on the &s;ea, to di&s;cover if the bark was yet come.</P>
<P>Viane kept his word; arrived at Majorea, he went to the viceroy, laid his commi&s;&s;ion before him, and demanded his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in favour of the enterpri&s;e; the viceroy gave him a brigatine. Viane, with his heart full of hope, flew to the deliverance of his brothers; he arrived on the coa&s;t of Algiers, the 28th day of September, of that &s;ame year 1577, one month from the day he had left it. Viane had ob&s;erved every place &s;o well, that he knew them again altho' it was night, he directs his little ve&s;&s;el towards the garden, where he was expected with &s;o much impatience. The gardener, who was on the watch, perceived him, and ran to acquaint the captive Span|iards of it. All their misfortunes are forgot|ten at this happy news, they embrace each other, they pre&s;s to get out of the cave, they view with tears of joy the bark of their deli|verer;
<PB N="7" REF="033741_0009_0FF8C175A39661D0">
&mdash;but alas! as the prow touched the &s;hore, &s;ome Moors were pa&s;&s;ing that way, and knowing the Chri&s;tians, cried out to arms! Viane trembling &s;preads his &s;ails, gains the open &s;ea and di&s;appears; the unhappy cap|tives, fallen again into their chains, went to weep at the bottom of their cave.</P>
<P>Cervantes re-animates them, he made them hope, and flattered him&s;elf that Viane would return again; but Viane returned no more. Grief, and the dampne&s;s of their narrow and unhealthy abode, brought di&s;orders on the&s;e unhappy people. Cervantes was no longer able to procure nece&s;&s;aries for &s;ome, to take care of others, and to encourage all: he got one of his companions to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, and gave him the charge of providing victuals in his place. The per&s;on he made choice of was a traitor, he went to the King of Algiers, turn|ed Mu&s;&s;ulman, and led him&s;elf to the cave, a troop of &s;oldiers, who put the thirteen Span|iards in irons, and dragged them before the King; that Prince promi&s;ed them their lives,

if they would declare who was the author of the enterpri&s;e;&mdash;It is I, &s;aid Cervantes to him, &s;ave my brothers, and put me to death. The King re&s;pects his intrepidity, he gave him back to his ma&s;ter Arnaut Mami, who would not put &s;o brave a man to death.</P>
<P>The unhappy gardener, who had made the cave, was hung up by one leg, till his blood &s;mothered him. Cervantes, deceived by for|tune, betrayed by his friend, and returned to his fir&s;t chains, only became more ardent to break them; four times he failed in his at|tempts, and was on the point of being impaled. His la&s;t effort was to cau&s;e a revolt among all the &s;laves in Algiers, and to make him&s;elf ma&s;|ter of it; they di&s;covered this con&s;piracy, yet Cervantes was not put to death;&mdash;&s;o certain it is, that true courage will make it&s;elf re&s;|pected even among barbarians.</P>
<P>It is true, that Cervantes being willing to &s;peak of him&s;elf, in the novel of the Captive, one of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting in Don Quixotte, &s;ays,</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="033741_0011_0FF8F6BB489FEE78">
<Q>That the cruel Azan, King of Algiers was never merciful only to a Spani&s;h &s;oldier, named Saavedra; who expo&s;ed him&s;elf of|ten to the mo&s;t frightful puni&s;hments, which will not for a long time be forgotten by the infidels.</Q></P>
<P>In the mean time, the King of Algiers, willing to be the ma&s;ter of &s;o famous a cap|tive, purcha&s;ed him from Arnaut Mami, and had him clo&s;ely confined. A &s;hort time af|ter, this Prince being obliged to go to Con|&s;tantinople, demanded from Spain the ran&s;om of his pri&s;oner. The mother of Cervantes, Leonora de Cortinas, a widow and poor, &s;old all that &s;he had, and ran to Madrid, carrying with her three hundred ducats to the fathers of the Trinity, who were charged with the redemption of captives. This money, which was the intire and only fortune of the widow, was far from being &s;ufficient. The King A|zan would have five hundred crowns of gold; the Trinitarians, touched with compa&s;&s;ion, completed the &s;um, and Cervantes was ran|&s;omed

the 19th of September 1580, after a &s;lavery of five years.</P>
<P>On his return to Spain, di&s;gu&s;ted with a military life, and re&s;olving to deliver him&s;elf up entirely to letters, he retired near his mo|ther, with the fond hope of &s;upporting her by his works. Cervantes was then thirty three years old, he began with GALATEA, of which he gave but the fir&s;t &s;ix books, and which he never completed. This work &s;ucceeded pret|ty well; the &s;ame year he married Donna Catherine de Palacios, &s;he was de&s;cended from a good family, but &s;he was poor, and this marriage did not enrich him. To main|tain his family, Cervantes wrote comedies; he a&s;&s;ures us, that they were well received, but very &s;oon after this, he quitted the theatre for a &s;mall employment which he obtained at Se|ville, where he went to &s;ettle. It was there he wrote tho&s;e novels where he paints &s;o well the vices of that great city.</P>
<P>Cervantes was near fifty years old, when he was obliged to take a journey into La Mancha.

The inhabitants of a little village named Ar|gamazilla, picked a quarrel with him, threw him into pri&s;on, and left him in it a long time; it was there that he began Don Quixotte, he believed that he &s;hould revenge him&s;elf on tho&s;e who had in&s;ulted him, by making their country the country of his hero. He affected in the mean time not to mention once in his romance, the town where he had been &s;o bad|ly treated. He began by giving to the pub|lic no more than the fir&s;t part of Don Quix|otte, which did not &s;ucceed. Cervantes knew mankind; he publi&s;hed a pamphlet called "The Squib,"&mdash;this work, which it would be impo&s;&s;ible to find now, even in Spain, &s;eems to be a critici&s;m on Don Quixotte that covered his &s;landerers with ridicule;&mdash;every one read the &s;atire, and Don Quixotte obtain|ed by this bagatelle, the reputation which &s;ince has been due only to it&s;elf.&mdash;Then all the enemies of good ta&s;te let them&s;elves loo&s;e again&s;t Cervantes.

by his &s;ucce&s;s, than ever he had been by his di&s;graces, he dur&s;t not venture to give any thing to the public for &s;everal years, his &s;ilence added to his mi&s;ery without appea&s;ing envy. &mdash;Happily the Count de Lemos and the Car|dinal of Toledo lent him &s;ome &s;uccours; this protection, which Cervantes con&s;idered as &s;o valuable, was continued to him almo&s;t to his death, but was never proportioned either to the merit of the protected, nor to the wealth of the protector. Cervantes, to &s;how his gratitude to the Count de Lemos, dedicated his novels to him, which appeared eight years after the fir&s;t part of Don Quixotte; the year following he gave his "Voyage to Parna&s;&s;us," but the&s;e works brought him but little money, and the &s;uccours of the Count de Lemos were always very weak, &s;ince Cervantes to procure bread was obliged to print eight comedies, which the players had refu&s;ed to perform; he &s;eemed de&s;tined to misfortunes and humiliations of every kind&punc;</P>
<P>This &s;ame year, an Arragonian, who took
<PB N="13" REF="033741_0015_0FF8F6C6B4266B08">
the name of d'Avellaneda, wrote a continua|tion of Don Quixotte; a wretched continua|tion, without ta&s;te, without wit, and without gaiety, but in which he &s;aid many things in|jurious to Cervantes;&mdash;this &s;ort of merit made the book be read. Cervantes replied to it as all the &s;atires ought to have been replied to: &mdash;he publi&s;hed the &s;econd part of Don Quix|otte, &s;uperior &s;till to the fir&s;t, every one was convinced of his merit, but the more they were obliged to render him ju&s;tice, the le&s;s &s;orry were they that a rival, even de&s;picable, &s;hould in&s;ult him whom they were forced to admire.&mdash;Spain is not, perhaps, the only coun|try in the world, where malignity &s;o &s;evere on good works is always indulgent to their de|tractors. Whil&s;t Cervantes lived, Avallaneda was read, as &s;oon as he was dead, his enemy was forgotten.</P>
<P>The &s;econd part of Don Quixotte was the la&s;t work printed during his life;&mdash;he worked &s;till at the romance of "Perfiles and Sigi&s;mun|da," when he was attacked by a complaint of

which he died, it was a drop&s;y;&mdash;he felt very &s;oon that he could not be cured, and fearing not to have time to fini&s;h his work, augment|ed his di&s;order by inten&s;e application. He was very &s;oon at the extremity; tranquil and &s;erene on the bed of death, as he had been patient under his misfortunes, his con&s;tancy and philo&s;ophy never for&s;ook him a moment. Four days before his death he had his ro|mance of Per&s;iles brought to him, and traced with a feeble hand, the epi&s;tle dedicatory, ad|dre&s;&s;ed to the Count de Lemos, who ju&s;t then arrived from Italy;&mdash;this letter de&s;erves to be remembered&mdash; it is as follows:&mdash;</P>

<HEAD>OF THE WORKS OF CERVANTES.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t poetical works of Cervantes are not much known, nor do they de&s;erve it;&mdash; his &s;onnets and elegies are written too much in the ta&s;te of his age&mdash;his be&s;t work, that which has immortalized his name, is the "Ro|mance of Don Quixotte;"&mdash;the judgment, the gaiety, the fine irony diffu&s;ed through this work, the great truth of the portraits, the purity, the &s;implicity of the &s;tyle, have rendered this work immortal: I know that it is not equally plea&s;ing to all French readers who do not under&s;tand Spani&s;h; this ari&s;es
<PB N="18" REF="033741_0020_0FF8C179EDC8E2E0">
from the faults of the only tran&s;lation which we have of it, it is very far from the elegance and the delicacy of the original. The tran&s;|lator &s;eems to have con&s;idered Don Quixotte as a common romance, who&s;e &s;ole merit was to be entertaining. He has tran&s;lated the Spani&s;h word by the French one, which he found in the dictionary, without comparing or without chu&s;ing; he forgot that in works of humour no word is &s;ynonimous to another; that one word alone is apt, and all others im|proper.</P>
<P>The manner in which he has tran&s;lated the pieces of poetry, of which there are many in Don Quixotte, would per&s;uade us that the Spani&s;h ver&s;es are ridiculous; when, in fact, they are all agreeable&mdash;perhaps too ab&s;tru&s;e.</P>
<P>But Cervantes wrote for his nation, who&s;e ta&s;te is different from ours; and the tran&s;la|tor, who wrote for us, ought, whil&s;t he pre|&s;erved the thoughts of Cervantes, to have weakened &s;ome compari&s;ons, &s;oftened &s;ome of the images, and have, above all, given
<PB N="19" REF="033741_0021_0FF8F6D4B77B23E8">
&s;weetne&s;s and harmony to the ver&s;es. He appears to have thought of nothing but being literal, and this among the French, is con&s;i|dered as a fault. To us almo&s;t all foreign books &s;eem too long; even Don Quixotte has prolixities and &s;trokes of bad ta&s;te, which might be retrenched without the tran&s;lator's meriting the reproach of not being exact; when a work of entertainment is to be tran&s;la|ted, the tran&s;lation mo&s;t agreeable, is, without doubt, the mo&s;t faithful.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the&s;e faults, the work is &s;o excellent in it&s;elf, the epi&s;odes &s;o intere&s;t|ing, the adventures &s;o comic, that all the world knows it, all the world read it again and again;&mdash;our tape&s;try, our pictures and our prints, all repre&s;ent Don Quixotte to us; and even the children laugh when they &s;ee Sancho Panza.</P>
<P>Cervantes's novels fall far &s;hort of Don Quixotte; he wrote twelve, and four alone are worthy of him,&mdash;"The Curious Imperti|nent,"
<PB N="20" REF="033741_0022_0FF8F6D71CA494A0">
which is in&s;erted in Don Quixotte; "Riconnet and Cortadille," a whim&s;ical but true picture of the rogues of Seville:&mdash;"The Force of Blood," the mo&s;t intere&s;ting and be&s;t conducted of the whole;&mdash;and "The Dia|logue of the Dog?." This la&s;t is a charming piece of critici&s;m, abounding with philo&s;ophy and gaiety; the Spani&s;h manners are there drawn with all the accuracy, &s;implicity, and &s;pirit of Cervantes. We have had within tho&s;e few years a French tran&s;lation of the&s;e twelve novels, but they ought to be read in the original.</P>
<P>The "Journey to Parna&s;&s;us," is a poetical work, divided into chapters. Cervantes feigns that Apollo threatened by legions of bad po|ets, &s;ends Mercury into Spain, to a&s;&s;emble all his favourites, and conduct them to defend Parna&s;&s;us. Mercury finds Cervantes, and &s;hows him the li&s;t of tho&s;e whom Apollo re|quires to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, and of their adver&s;aries. It is evident what a fine opportunity this fic|tion gave a man of wit to be revenged on the
<PB N="21" REF="033741_0023_0FF8F6DBA28A6458">
dunces who had in&s;ulted him. This work is not very agreeable, nor can we reli&s;h it high|ly; I know not any tran&s;lation of this, nor of his comedies; they are eight in number, and Cervantes &s;ays in his prologue, that he had written twenty or thirty; this uncertainty mu&s;t appear wonderful to tho&s;e who know how difficult it is to write even one comedy;&mdash;be that as it may, tho&s;e which are pre&s;erved, di|mini&s;h our regret for tho&s;e that are lo&s;t. I have read them all with attention, none of them are tolerable; unintere&s;ting, badly con|ducted, often witty, always improbable; &s;uch is the characteri&s;tic of all his plays. In that called "The Happy Ruffian," the hero, who in the fir&s;t act is the greate&s;t villain in Seville, becomes a Jacobin at Mexico in the &s;econd: he is the pattern of the convent; he has fre|quent encounters with the devil, upon the &s;tage, and always remains conqueror. Being called to attend a lady of the place, then on her death-bed, who&s;e life had been very irreg|ular, Father Crux, for &s;o he is called, pre&s;&s;es her in vain, to confe&s;s her &s;ins; the dying la|dy
<PB N="22" REF="033741_0024_0FF8F6DD6128CCD0">
believes her&s;elf too culpable to hope for pardon:&mdash;At la&s;t Father Crux, anxious to prevent her reprobation, offers to take her &s;ins on him, and give her his merits; the exchange is made, the bargain &s;igned, the dying lady confe&s;&s;es, angels receive her &s;oul, and devils &s;eize upon the Jacobin; who &s;ees his bo|dy covered with frightful ulcers. In the third act he dies, and works miracles. This is one of the comedies of the author of Don Quixotte, and perhaps, his be&s;t.</P>
<P>There are, be&s;ides, eight little pieces of Cer|vantes, which the Spaniards call Entreme&s;es; the&s;e are better than his comedies; they are comic and natural, &s;ome of them rather too free, but two of them are charming above the re&s;t; one called "The Cave of Salamanca," is exactly our Soldier Magician; the French comic opera is formed after the model of the Spani&s;h; the other, called "The Miraculous Picture," has furni&s;hed Piron with the idea of an opera ballad, The Fal&s;e Prodigy, much in|ferior to Cervantes's work.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="033741_0025_0FF8F6E074D4F2B8">"Per&s;iles and Sigi&s;munda," of which we have two unfaithful tran&s;lations, is a long ro|mance, loaded with epi&s;odes and adventures, almo&s;t always incredible. It &s;eems as if Cer|vantes wi&s;hed to imitate the old Greek ro|mances &s;till e&s;teemed and formerly admired. But all his imagination, which, perhaps, never was more brilliant than in Per&s;iles, is in&s;uffici|ent to render his heroes intere&s;ting; their u&s;e|le&s;s adventures, their improbable dangers, and the con&s;tant medley of love and devotion, have hindered this work from attaining the repu|tation of its author; but the elegance of the &s;tyle, the great truth of &s;ome of the portraits, and the epi&s;ode of "Ruperte" are &s;ufficient to render it of great value.</P>
<P>It remains that I &s;hould &s;peak of "GALA|TEA," his fir&s;t performance. At the time he wrote it, Spain was the mo&s;t gallant nation in the world, love was the &s;ole occupation of the Spaniards, and the &s;ubject of all their books.</P>
<P>Montemayor, a celebrated poet, publi&s;hed the romance of "Diana," which has been
<PB N="24" REF="033741_0026_0FF8F6E4F351C588">
tran&s;lated into French. This work met with the greate&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, and merited it in &s;ome re&s;pects; a pure &s;tyle, great wit, &s;weetne&s;s and &s;entiment, often an enchanting &s;train of poetry, and the affecting elegant &s;implicity which predominates in the novel of the moor Abindarraes, redeems in the eyes of con|noi&s;&s;eurs, the improbability of the &s;tory, the intervention of magic, and the want of ac|tion which have been the reproach of the Di|ana of Montemayor. Cervantes, who per|ceived all the&s;e defects, as may be &s;een from his &s;crutiny of Don Quixotte's library, has, in Galatea, avoided &s;ome of the&s;e faults; but not all. His adventures are more natural, his characters more intere&s;ting, but his &s;tyle, and above all his poetry, place him below Mon|temayor.&mdash;Infected with the mi&s;erable &s;chola&s;tic ta&s;te which then prevailed, Cervan|tes has made his &s;hepherds declaim as if in the &s;chool, they pronounce long di&s;&s;ertations for and again&s;t Love; they cite Minos, Ixion, Antony, Rodriguez and all the heroes of fa|ble and hi&s;tory: if Tircis wi&s;hes to con&s;ole

his friend who can obtain no mark of favour from his &s;hepherde&s;s, his &s;peech is to this ef|fect:</P>
<P><Q>It is allowed by all, that Galatea is &s;till more beautiful than cruel; but they add, that above all, &s;he is di&s;creet. Now if this be true, as it ought to be, it follows that by her good &s;en&s;e &s;he &s;hould know her&s;elf, and from this knowledge that &s;he &s;hould e&s;teem her&s;elf; from this e&s;teem that &s;he &s;hould wi&s;h not to be lo&s;t, and from this wi&s;h, that &s;he will not yield to your de&s;ires.</Q></P>
<P>In another place, a lover &s;eparated from his mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;ays in ver&s;e,
<Q>Although I &s;eem to &s;ee, to under&s;tand, and to feel, yet I am only a phantom formed by Love, and &s;u&s;|tained by Hope.</Q>
Through the whole work the &s;un only illuminates the world by the light which he receives from the eyes of Galatea. The&s;e &s;pecimens enable us to form an idea of the bad ta&s;te which formely pre|vailed, and from which even Cervantes was not free. But in the mid&s;t of the&s;e follies,
<PB N="26" REF="033741_0028_0FF8F6E8DB920F48">
we find beautiful ideas, true &s;entiment, ele|gantly expre&s;&s;ed, intere&s;ting &s;ituations, the emotions and agitations of the heart. The&s;e were what induced me to give an imitation of his Galatea; it has never been tran&s;lated, this romance is utterly unknown to the French.</P>
<P>As it is very po&s;&s;ible my labours will be un&s;ucce&s;sful, I mu&s;t, for the honour of Cer|vantes, enumerate here all the changes which I have made in his work. Galatea, in the original, con&s;i&s;ts of &s;ix books, and is not con|cluded: the&s;e I have compri&s;ed in three, and have fini&s;hed it in a fourth. I have tran&s;la|ted hardly any part, the ver&s;es in particular, only re&s;emble the Spani&s;h ones in the places quoted. I have only taken the heads of the adventures, I have even changed circum&s;tan|ces, where it has appeared nece&s;&s;ary; I have added entire &s;cenes, as the exchange of crooks in the fir&s;t book; the country fea&s;t and the &s;tory of the doves in the &s;econd; and the farewell to Elicio's dog in the third; the fourth is entirely my own invention. I &s;hall
<PB N="27" REF="033741_0029_0FF8F6EDF6ACBFF8">
no doubt, be reproached with the great num|ber of epi&s;odes, and the few events in which Galatea is concerned. In Cervantes, there are twice as many epi&s;odes, and Galatea does &s;till le&s;s. Montemayor has committed the &s;ame fault in Diana, which is in fact, nothing but a recital of different hi&s;tories; &s;uch was the ta&s;te of the times. Such are our great French romances, &s;o long the fa&s;hion, where the authors took the Spaniards for their models, as to battles and duels, which one will be perhaps a&s;toni&s;hed to find in a pa&s;to|ral work; it is a tribute which Cervantes paid to his nation. I know no Spani&s;h ro|mance or comedy without combats; this peo|ple, one of the mo&s;t valiant in Europe, and without di&s;pute, the mo&s;t amorous, required in a book to plea&s;e them, recitals of Love and War. Finally, we ought to pardon Cer|vantes, who him&s;elf met with adventures, the mo&s;t extraordinary, for &s;uppo&s;ing that what had happened to him&s;elf would appear pro|bable in a romance.</P>
<P>I have but one word more to &s;ay on the
<PB N="28" REF="033741_0030_0FF8F6EFB3F57BB0">
judgement which I have pre&s;umed to pa&s;s on the works of Cervantes. Notwith&s;tanding the particular &s;tudy I made of his language, I re&s;ted not entirely on my own knowledge; but I have been guided by the information of a Spaniard, who is as much devoted to literature, as to his country, and who has this in common with Cervantes, that he is &s;till more celebrated for his talents than for his misfortunes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Count De Pilos.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>Such were the complaints of Elicio, a &s;hepherd on the banks of the Tagus. Nature had enriched him with her gifts, but Fortune and Love had not treated him with equal kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>Long had he loved Galatea, without being able as yet to flatter him&s;elf that he was beloved of her. Ga|latea was a &s;imple &s;hepherde&s;s of the &s;ame village as Elicio; but &s;he had been queen of the world, if the world had been given to the mo&s;t beautiful, and mo&s;t de&s;erving.</P>
<P>'Tis Galatea and Elicio, who&s;e adventures I am go|ing to relate. I &s;hall join to the&s;e &s;ome others, of who&s;e con&s;tancy love was willing to make trial; and I &s;hall al&s;o de&s;cribe the manners of a village. Oh! ye who&s;e chief plea&s;ures are centered in a country life; &s;ouls of &s;en&s;ibility! to whom the a&s;pect of laughing fields, and the noi&s;e of falling waters afford delights equal almo&s;t to what are felt in doing of good actions; may you be able to find &s;ome plea&s;ure in peru&s;ing me!</P>
<P>Of all the &s;hepherds who were in love with Galatea, Elicio was the mo&s;t tender, and lea&s;t confident. Nor was his re&s;pect alone the &s;ole cau&s;e of his timidity; Meoris the father of Galatea was the riche&s;t hu&s;band|man
<PB N="3" REF="033741_0034_0FF8F6F9831C3808">
in the canton; while all the wealth of Elicio was his cottage, and a few goats.</P>
<P>Era&s;tres his rival was le&s;s poor, without being more happy. Era&s;tres, ever the mo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible of &s;hep|herds, had not been able however to re&s;i&s;t the charms of Galatea; but he did not flatter him&s;elf that he could be plea&s;ing to her. Too &s;imple to be amiable, he could feel, but he knew not how to expre&s;s him&s;elf. Nature in forming him had been content with giving him a good heart.</P>
<P>One day as Elicio in a &s;olitary dale was thinking of her whom he loved, he &s;aw Era&s;tres appear, preceded by his flock, which he left the conducting of to his dogs. The&s;e faithful animals &s;eemed as if they gue&s;&s;ed that their ma&s;ter was too much in love to mind his &s;heep. Their attention &s;eemed to be doubled. They ran round them, pre&s;&s;ed on the lazy ones, led back tho&s;e that were rambling from their fellows; thus do|ing at the &s;ame time their own duty and that of the &s;hepherd.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as Era&s;tres was near Elicio, I hope, &s;aid he to him, that you are not &s;ad, becau&s;e I am in love with Galatea. You know that it is impo&s;&s;ible not to love her. May my lambs in the moment that I wean them find nothing in their pa&s;tures but poi&s;onous herbs, if it be not true that a thou&s;and times I have been tempted to forget my love. I have con&s;ulted all the doctors in the country, yet none of them have been able to cure me; and I come to a&s;k your leave to retain my malady to my death. You will ri&s;que nothing in granting me this favour, &s;ince you who are the mo&s;t engaging of
<PB N="4" REF="033741_0035_0FF8F6FD965A1F48">
all our &s;hepherds, have not been able to move Gala|tea to pity, what have you to fear from a clown like me?</P>
<P>Elicio &s;miled at this di&s;cour&s;e. My friend, &s;aid he, I have no right to be jealous. Our &s;orrows are the &s;ame, and they ought to endear us to each other. From this moment we will &s;eparate no more; we will talk uncea&s;ingly of Galatea, and friend&s;hip, without doubt, will help to a&s;&s;uage the pains that love cau&s;es us to &s;uffer.</P>
<P>The two rivals now become friends, were preparing their pipes to play, when Galatea with her flock ap|peared upon the hill. A &s;imple bodice, and a petticoat of plain &s;tuff, compo&s;ed the whole of her attire. Her &s;hape alone rendered this habit charming. Her long light hair floated on her &s;houlders, and a &s;traw hat guarded her face from the ardour of the &s;un. Un|adorned as the &s;imple flowers of the field, &s;he was beautiful and &s;he knew it not.</P>
<P>Elicio advanced to &s;peak to her, but the dogs of Galatea, who let no per&s;on approach the flock, ran growling towards the &s;hepherd. Scarcely had they recollected him, when a&s;hamed of their ill behaviour, they &s;tooped down their necks, dropt their tails, and went to hide their heads under his care&s;&s;ing hands. The conducting ram with whom Elicio had often di|vided his bread, perceived him, and came up to him with his head erect, and bell ringing, all the &s;heep fol|lowed him. Elicio opened for them his &s;crip, he di|&s;tributed to the dogs, and to the flock all that it con|tained, while tears of joy ran from his eyes. The &s;hepherde&s;s embarra&s;&s;ed thus, at &s;eeing the &s;heep know
<PB N="5" REF="033741_0036_0FF8F702C7633470">
her lover &s;o well, blu&s;hed, and ha&s;ting to the ram, &s;truck him with her crook, and obliged him to remove from Elicio.</P>
<P>The &s;hepherd reproached her for this movement of anger; why, &s;aid he, puni&s;h your &s;heep when it is me that you wi&s;h to puni&s;h. The&s;e pa&s;tures are the be&s;t in the canton; you have power to fly me; but leave here your lambs, and I will neglect my goats to take care of them;&mdash;if this favour &s;eems too great, choo&s;e the place where you would wi&s;h to pa&s;s the day, and I will remove my&s;elf, becau&s;e it will be more agreeable to you: Elicio, &s;aid Galatea, it is not to a|void you that I turn my &s;heep another way I am lead|ing them to the brook of palm-trees, where I expect to meet my dear Flori&s;e;&mdash;I am grateful to you for your offers; and I prove it to you by di&s;&s;ipating your &s;u&s;|picions. While &s;he was &s;till &s;peaking, &s;he pur&s;ued her way. Era&s;tres cried out to her from far, May you yet fall in love with &s;ome one who will treat you with as little pity as you treat us; May you. . . . he would have &s;aid more if Galatea had not began to &s;ing, as her cu&s;tom was, whenever &s;he moved with her flock. The mo&s;t angry lover would rather li&s;ten to the voice of his mi&s;tre&s;s, than &s;ay injurious things to her; Era&s;tres was &s;ilent, and Galatea &s;ung the&s;e words:&mdash;</P>

<P>Galatea had fini&s;hed her &s;ong ju&s;t as &s;he had arrived at the rivulet of palm-trees. Flori&s;e was already there, her be&s;t friend, the confident of her mo&s;t &s;ecret thoughts. They &s;at down together upon the borders of the brook, and employed them&s;elves in gathering the &s;urrounding flowers; when they perceived a &s;hep|herde&s;s who was unknown to them. This &s;tranger, young and beautiful, &s;eemed overwhelmed with grief; from time to time &s;he &s;topped, &s;ighed, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">oked up <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o heaven, with her eyes &s;wimming in tears. Too much occupied with her &s;orrows, to perceive Galatea, &s;he approached the brook, took up &s;ome of the water in her hands, and wa&s;hed her eyes wearied with weep|ing: Alas! &s;aid &s;he, there is no water able to extin|gui&s;h the fire that con&s;umes me.</P>
<P>Galatea and Flori&s;e ran towards the &s;tranger; If Heaven, &s;aid they to her, is as much touched with your tears as we are, you would very &s;oon have no cau&s;e to &s;hed them; we pity your misfortunes, even though
<PB N="7" REF="033741_0038_0FF8F7074DBE20A0">
we do not know them; how often are they a&s;&s;uaged by recounting them! a &s;atisfaction of that &s;ort you might feel, by pouring them into our bo&s;oms; yet it would be cruel to demand a recital of what might be wound|ing to your heart. This recital, replied the &s;tranger, will perhaps deprive me of the friend&s;hip which you &s;eem to promi&s;e me; when you are informed that all my &s;orrows &s;pring from love; may I hope that you will &s;till pity me? The &s;hepherde&s;&s;es, after having a&s;&s;ur|ed her in the tendere&s;t manner of their freind&s;hip, con|ducted her into a neighbouring grove&mdash;they &s;at down in the &s;hade, and after a pau&s;e of a few moments, the &s;tranger began her hi&s;tory:</P>
<P>"I was born in a village, &s;ituated on the banks of the Henares, celebrated for the fre&s;hne&s;s, and the clear|ne&s;s of its waters; my father is a farmer, and my life was occupied &s;olely in country employments; every morning I led my &s;heep to their pa&s;tures, frequently alone, yet &s;olitude never weared me. In the woods I li&s;tened delighted to the birds, I &s;ung with them; I gathered the red ro&s;e, the lilly without &s;pot, and the pink of various dye; this amu&s;ement rendered the day happy, I loved nothing &s;o well as my lambs, and I fought for nothing in the country, but flowers and the cool &s;hade.</P>
<P>"How many times have I laughed at the &s;ighs and tears of &s;ome of our &s;heperde&s;&s;es, who have made me the confident of their loves? I remember that one day the young Lydia came, and throwing her&s;elf upon my neck, bathed me with her tears. Alarmed at her de&s;|pair, I wiped her eyes, and embracing her, enquired
<PB N="8" REF="033741_0039_0FF8F7098CCE7CF8">
with tenderne&s;s what frightful misfortune had co&s;t her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, cried <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> to her, is he de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Leolin|da, replied <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> me, he is gone! . . . . he is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> this morning I have &s;een the &s;hepherders Leolinda, with the ro&s;e coloured ribband, which I, the other day gave <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ingrate. I declare to you, amiable &s;hepherde&s;&s;es, that I could not hinder my&s;elf from laughing at this recital, every word of which was cut &s;hort with &s;ighs. Lydia was offend|ed, &s;he looked at me, bowed her head, and went a|way. I would have detained her: Teolinda, &s;aid &s;he to me, may you one day feel the &s;orrows that I now &s;uffer, and experience in your confidents the &s;ame pi|ty that I find in you! Such was her wi&s;h, perhaps it is you, &s;hepherde&s;&s;es, who will accompli&s;h it this day.</P>
<P>"Thus did I live, carele&s;s, free and happy; but I was not to be long &s;o:&mdash;One day, it was the vigil of the patron &s;aint of our village, I had gone with many other girls to get green boughs, and gather flowers to ornament our church; we found on our way, a troop of &s;hepherds, &s;itting under the &s;hade of myrtles; they were all our friends or relations, and had come out before us, &s;ix of them reque&s;ted that they might go in our place, to get the green boughs and flowers, which we wanted, we accepted their offer, and remain|ed with the re&s;t of their companions.</P>
<P>"Among the&s;e young people, was a &s;tranger, whom I then &s;aw for the fir&s;t time. Scarcely had I beheld him, when I felt a fire run through my veins that was unknown to me before, I doubted what it could be, Lydia was there, I thought to have fallen at her feet,
<PB N="9" REF="033741_0040_0FF8F70B2BC50848">
and a&s;ked forgivene&s;s for not having compa&s;&s;ionated in her, the pains that I already felt.</P>
<P>"It was ea&s;y to read in my face all that pa&s;&s;ed in my heart; but every one was occupied with the &s;tranger. They begged of him to fini&s;h a &s;ong, which our arrival had interrupted; he agreed, and I trembled, le&s;t love &s;hould be the &s;ubject; if he be in love, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, he will not think of any thing but love; happily he &s;ung only the plea&s;ures of a country life, and the means of pre&s;erving flocks, he &s;aid nothing of that, which cau&s;es the death of &s;hepherde&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>"Scarcely had he fini&s;hed, when we &s;aw tho&s;e com|ing back, who had gone to cut the green branches; they were &s;o loaden, that walking in a line, and linked clo&s;ely together, one would have believed they &s;aw a little hill approach, covered with its own trees. When they came near to us, they began a village round, to which we re&s;ponded; &s;oon after they laid down their burdens, and offered each &s;hepherde&s;s a garland of dif|ferent kinds of flowers. We accepted their pre&s;ents, and began to prepare to return to the village; when the olde&s;t among&s;t them, named Eleuco, &s;topped us: I think, &s;aid he, that each of you ought to recompence us for our pains, by giving her garland to him that &s;he loves be&s;t; that is but ju&s;t, &s;aid one of my companions, at the &s;ame time putting her garland on the head of her cou&s;in; the others followed her example, and every one made choice of a relation. I remained for the la&s;t, and by good fortune, I had no cou&s;in there.</P>
<P>"I appeared as if I was uncertain what to do, at length approaching the &s;tranger, I give you this gar|land, &s;aid I, in the name of all my companions, as a

<P>"The &s;tranger received my favours with gratitude and mode&s;ty; he &s;eized the in&s;tant when no one could hear him, to &s;ay to me in a low voice, I have paid you very dear for the garland I have received: you have given me nothing but flowers; and I, I, . . . . . he could not fini&s;h, for my companions came up, and pre&s;&s;ed me to depart. I an&s;wered nothing, but I kept my eyes on the &s;tranger, as long as it was po&s;&s;ible; he occupied my thoughs all the way, and when I go home, I could only think of him.</P>

Each appeared as if con|fident of bearing it away; I was only intere&s;ted for one per&s;on, and for him all my vows were exhau&s;ted. Ar|tidore, for this was the name of my &s;tranger, was con|queror in all the &s;ports, he was applauded by every one. Alanio, &s;aid one, ran &s;wifter than Sylvanio Marcellus is &s;tronger than Ly&s;ander; but Artidore car|ries it away from them all.

<P>"I did not know whether my &s;ong was plea&s;ing to Artidore; but he profited by it. During his &s;tay with us, he u&s;ed &s;o much circum&s;pection and prudence in the attentions he rendered me, that the mo&s;t envi|ous ob&s;erver could not find a word to &s;ay.</P>
<P>"I was certain of being beloved, nor had I been able to conceal from my lover that my heart was his. We had agreed that he &s;hould return to his village as he had given out; and that a few days after he &s;hould &s;end a friend of his family to a&s;k me in marriage of my father; we were both of us &s;ure that our parents would con&s;ent, every thing &s;eemed favourable to our wi&s;hes, when two days before the departure of Arti|dore, my ill fate brought back my twin &s;i&s;ter from a neighbouring village where &s;he had been for &s;ome time, to &s;ee an aunt of mine; this &s;i&s;ter, by a fatality very rare, is my living picture, her face, her &s;hape, her voice, all bear &s;o exact a re&s;emblance to mine, that our parents in order to know us from each other,

In the evening my &s;i&s;ter returned, and told me with an air of my&s;tery, that &s;he had &s;omething to &s;ay to me of importance; my heart beat violently, already I had a foreboding of my misfortune, I went and &s;hut my&s;elf up with her; judge what my thoughts were, when I heard her &s;peak the&s;e words:&mdash;</P>

<P>"You may ea&s;ily conceive, amiable &s;hepherde&s;&s;es, what I &s;uffered during this recital; I would have given the half of my life that it was morning, that I might fly and undeceive my unhapy lover.

<P>WHEN &s;hall I be able to live in a village&mdash;when &s;hall I be the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of a cottage, encompa&s;&s;ed by cherry trees! clo&s;e by it, could there be a garden, an orchard, a meadow, &s;ome bee-hives, and a rivulet, bordered with filbert trees &s;urrounding my Empire;&mdash; My de&s;ires &s;hould never pa&s;s beyond that &s;tream. There &s;hould my happy days glide peaceably away; every moment of my time &s;hould be occupied in walk|ing, reading, or in rural employments.&mdash;I would have be&s;ides, &s;omething to live on, and al&s;o &s;omething to give away; for without this, riches are nothing; to have only for one's &s;elf, is having nothing. If I could enjoy all the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings with a partner, prudent and amiable, and &s;ee our children &s;porting on the green <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, vieing with each other, who &s;hall run &s;wifte&s;t to embrace their mother;&mdash;I believe, that I ought to excite the envy of all the Kings of the Uni|ver&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="033741_0054_0FF8F738F6E281B0">Such was the &s;tate of tho&s;e &s;hepherds, who&s;e hi&s;to|ry I write. A happy marriage generally crowned a virtuous attachment. Daranio, the beloved of Syl|veria, was now to become her hu&s;band. At the fir&s;t dawn of the morning, all the inhabitants of the village, and of the neighbouring hamlets, were already a&s;&s;em|bled on the public green. Some had made garlands to ornament the doors of the bride and bridegroom; others with flutes and tamborines u&s;hered in the hap|py day, with joyful melody; here was heard the ru|ral pipe; there the harmonious violin; and farther off, the antique p&s;altery. One was employed in ty|ing ribbands to his ca&s;tanets; another ornamenting his hat with bunches of flowers.&mdash;Every one was ea|ger to plea&s;e his mi&s;tre&s;s; all were animated with Love and Joy.</P>
<P>The bride and bridegroom did not wait long. They were &s;oon di&s;covered, coming decked out in their gaye&s;t apparel; Galatea and the young girls conducted Sylveria;&mdash;and Elicio and the &s;hepherds &s;urrounded Daranio. The happy troop took their way to the church, amid&s;t the &s;ound of all the in&s;truments.</P>
<P>After they had vowed an eternal fidelity, the new married couple returned to the village green, and all the young women ran to &s;eek for the pre&s;ents which they had de&s;tined for the bride;&mdash;One came and offer|ed to Sylveria, a ba&s;ket of fruits; another carried in her hat, eggs that her pullets had newly laid&mdash;here one pre&s;ented a pullet, another a young cock; every one without regret, and without vanity, made an offering proportionable to their riches.</P>
<P>Galatea approached in her turn; &s;he carried two
<PB N="23" REF="033741_0055_0FF8F73BDB24AF48">
young turtles, which a &s;ervant of her father's had ta|ken in his nets.

<P>"I was at that time ill, and in no condition to follow my friend; our parting was mixed with many tears: I promi&s;ed to follow him, as &s;oon as my health would permit me; but I &s;oon found that the ab&s;ence of my friend was more in&s;upportable to me, even than my ill|ne&s;s;

<P>"It was night when I landed, and as I cro&s;&s;ed a &s;treet, I heard the cla&s;hing of &s;words; I perceived a man with his back again&s;t the wall, defending him|&s;elf &s;ingly again&s;t four a&s;&s;ailants.

<P>"I held him in my arms, and &s;hed tears of joy; how dear did I pay for this &s;weet re-union? my friend was wounded, and the emotion that the &s;ight of me cau&s;ed in him, exhau&s;ted his &s;pirits&mdash;he fell into my arms, fainting and bloody.&mdash;I &s;ent in&s;tantly for &s;uccour; a &s;urgeon in&s;pected his wounds, and gave me &s;ome hopes that they were not mortal.

<P>"This adventure &s;oon &s;pread through the city, and came to the ears of Ni&s;ida's father; he was enraged that the name of his daughter &s;hould be brought in que&s;tion, and be made a public talk of&mdash;and forbad the Italian prince, and my unfortunate friend, ever to come to his hou&s;e again.</P>

This dear friend, weak and &s;lowly recovering from his illne&s;s, could not &s;u&s;tain him&s;elf, but for my tender cares and a&s;&s;iduities.</P>
<P>"But Time, far from a&s;&s;uaging my mi&s;eries, only added to my unhappine&s;s;&mdash;every in&s;tant redoubled my pa&s;&s;ion, my remor&s;e, and my torments; my health was no longer proof again&s;t the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es, my face &s;oon lo&s;t the fre&s;hne&s;s of youth; my &s;unk and languid eyes could &s;carce turn them&s;elves on her, for whom I was thus dying. At length, the father of Ni&s;ida ex|pre&s;&s;ed his inquietude about me;&mdash;&s;he her&s;elf, and above all, her &s;i&s;ter Blanche begged of me one day, with the mo&s;t tender &s;olicitude, to open my heart to them and di&s;clo&s;e without re&s;erve, all its &s;orrows and pains. What a moment for me! but I &s;trengthened

my &s;oul, I recalled to my mind, all that I owed to my friend, and re&s;olved to expire, rather than betray him, and I &s;ummoned up all my re&s;olution to &s;ay the&s;e words:</P>
<P>"You will pity my &s;orrows &s;till more, when I tell you, that they are cau&s;ed by Friend&s;hip;&mdash;A young cavalier, my countryman, and bo&s;om friend, is in love with the mo&s;t beautiful, and mo&s;t amiable of women; he re&s;pects her &s;o much, that he fears ever to mention his pa&s;&s;ion to her, and this re&s;pect is, in fact, cutting &s;hort his life. It is him that I weep.&mdash;It is the mo&s;t generous and the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed of men, that Love is bringing to an early grave.</P>
<P>"At this place, Ni&s;ida interrupted me. Fabian, &s;aid &s;he, I have never known Love, but it appears to me to be &s;implicity to die, rather than tell a woman, that one loves her; the fir&s;t avowal of it would not be a|ble, I &s;hould think, to offend her; but even &s;uppo&s;ing that it wras badly received, there are always opportu|nities enough found for dying. Beautiful Ni&s;ida, &s;aid I, when one looks on love with the eyes of indifference, they &s;ee nothing in it, but the playfulne&s;s of children, which they laugh at, or at be&s;t but pity: but when the heart is wounded, the under&s;tanding, far from be|ing of u&s;e to us, is the fir&s;t to lead us a&s;tray.&mdash;Such is the &s;tate of my friend; by dint of intreaties and prayers, I got him to write to the object of his affection; I am charged with this letter, and I carry it always about me, in hopes of being able to deliver it. Could not one &s;ee this letter, &s;aid Ni&s;ida, for I am, I confe&s;s, curious to know the &s;tyle of a lover, who is truly &s;mitten?</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="033741_0069_0FF8F760CE1B82E0">"I did not let &s;o good an occa&s;ion as this e&s;cape me. I drew from my bo&s;om the billet that Timbrio had given me, a few days before; it was conceived in the&s;e terms:&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>I had determined, madam, never to have broken &s;ilence, happier in the thought of having in death de&s;erved your pity, rather than live under your di&s;|plea&s;ure: but it was too terrible to live, and not let you know that I adore you. If this avowal &s;hould not offend you, I feel that I &s;hall &s;till che|ri&s;h life, to con&s;ecrate it to you; but &s;hould my te|merity appear to you worthy of puni&s;hment, my death &s;hall &s;oon expiate my offence.</Q></P>
<P>"Ni&s;ida read this letter with great attention. I do not think, &s;aid &s;he, that a declaration &s;o re&s;pectful as this, can di&s;plea&s;e; and I advi&s;e you to deliver the billet, without being apprehen&s;ive that it will be badly received.&mdash;As yet I have had no opportunity, &s;aid I&punc; but my friend, in the mean time, is dying, and I think, that you have it in your power to &s;ave his life;&mdash;How is it po&s;&s;ible?&mdash;Do you reply to this bil|let, as if it was addre&s;&s;ed to you; this innocent device will re&s;tore him to new life, and will give me time to find the occa&s;ion that I &s;o ardently wi&s;h for. No, re|plied Ni&s;ida, I have never as yet returned an&s;wers to love-letters; and I would not wi&s;h to begin now by a deceit.&mdash;But &s;aid &s;he, after a moment's pau&s;e, what is to hinder you from letting your friend know all that has now happened; &s;ub&s;tituting the name of her whom he loves, in the place of mine? You may tell him that &s;he has read his letter, that &s;he had pre&s;&s;ed you to give it to her: that in fact you dur&s;t not tell
<PB N="38" REF="033741_0070_0FF8F765ED422A98">
her that the billet was for her&s;elf; but that you had, neverthele&s;s, room to hope that &s;he will yet hear of it, without anger. This &s;tratagem will be of u&s;e to the health of your friend, and cannot be contradicted, un|til you have &s;poken to his real mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>"Surpri&s;ed at this invention, I &s;tammered out &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions of thanks, and I ran to report every thing to Timbrio; the hopes which he conceived, his tran&s;|ports and his gratitude, were &s;o many links, that chain|ed me &s;till more to my duty.</P>
<P>"I redoubled my attentions towards Ni&s;ida, and tho' the prey of a pa&s;&s;ion, which her &s;ight could not fail but to encrea&s;e; I never &s;poke to her but of my friend. I employed for him the expre&s;&s;ions which my heart furni&s;hed me with for my&s;elf; and thus I made &s;ub&s;ervient to the cau&s;e of Friend&s;hip, that very feeling, which might have de&s;troyed it.</P>
<P>"At length, I took the re&s;olution to acquaint her of every thing. I told her that the per&s;on who was &s;o near dying for her, was Timbrio. I extolled his birth, dwelt on his good qualities, and his virtues; and in a word, I painted him as I &s;aw him. Ni&s;ida had not forgotten him, &s;he expre&s;&s;ed a &s;urpri&s;e, true or feign|ed, reproached me with my pre&s;umption, menacing me, to tell all to her father;&mdash;but acro&s;s the anger that &s;he forced her&s;elf to a&s;&s;ume, I &s;aw clearly that Tim|brio was beloved.</P>
<P>"This was the la&s;t &s;troke for me; a long time I had waited for it, yet it was not &s;en&s;ibly felt when it came. I re&s;olved to let Timbrio know his good fortune, and then to fly immediately afterwards, and die in a de&s;ert.</P>
<P>"I reckoned, however, too much on my courage;
<PB N="39" REF="033741_0071_0FF8F76A27D3A5F0">
the moment that I undertook to &s;ay to my rival that he was beloved, I lo&s;t the power of &s;peech, my eyes filled with tears, vainly would I have hid my trouble; my &s;ighs betrayed me, my &s;trength failed, and I fell upon the bo&s;om of my friend, and bathed him with my tears.</P>
<P>"Timbrio, &s;urpri&s;ed and terrified, &s;upported me in his arms, embraced me with tenderne&s;s, nor would he be &s;atisfied without knowing the cau&s;e of &s;o keen an affliction. I was &s;ilent, he pre&s;&s;ed me, unable to an|&s;wer, I threw my eyes down on the ground. Ah! I under&s;tand you, &s;aid he, you love her! you love her! 'twas not po&s;&s;ible but that you mu&s;t have loved her; thy faithful heart groans under the &s;acrifice it would make to thy friend&s;hip. O my Fabian, I &s;hould be indeed unworthy, if I accepted of her. Continue to love Ni&s;ida, for I will never &s;ee her more; I &s;hall, perhaps, be able to live without her, but I &s;hould be certain of dying, were I the cau&s;e of thy unhappine&s;s. In &s;aying the&s;e words, he turned away his face to hide his tears, while he pre&s;&s;ed me again&s;t his bo&s;om.</P>
<P>"Friend&s;hip in&s;pired me in this moment, I felt as it were lift above my&s;elf. You are mi&s;taken, replied I, it is not Ni&s;ida that I love, it is her &s;i&s;ter, who&s;e heart I have not been able to touch, and the violence of an unrequited love, is the &s;ole cau&s;e of my de&s;pair. You deceive me, Fabian, &s;aid he, looking &s;tedfa&s;tly in my face. No, my dear Timbrio, I adore Blanche, but &s;he de&s;pi&s;es my vows, pardon me then, if the compari&s;on of thy happy &s;tate with mine, draw &s;ome tears from me. I promi&s;e you, however, that I &s;hall weep no
<PB N="40" REF="033741_0072_0FF8F76C795E5B08">
more. Go, my friend, I feel, that while near you, my happine&s;s does not depend upon Love.</P>
<P>"Timbrio, either did, or feigned to believe me; he was re&s;olved, however, to a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf of the truth of what I &s;aid, the fir&s;t opportunity that he had, but I had determined my&s;elf, to make every &s;acrifice nece&s;|&s;ary to his quiet. It was not enough, that I &s;hould immolate my real pa&s;&s;ion; it was nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould feign to feel another. The very next day I di&s;cover|ed to Blanche who I was, and &s;poke to her of Love.</P>
<P>"Blanche had loved me for a long time, without dar|ing to avow it, even to her&s;elf; but no &s;ooner did &s;he believe her&s;elf beloved, than &s;he told it to her &s;i&s;ter; this confidence became u&s;eful to Timbrio. Ni&s;ida had &s;till oppo&s;ed a &s;entiment that &s;he dreaded, le&s;s a|fraid in finding a companion, &s;he ventured to give way to it, &s;he &s;poke of her love, and was penetrated the more with it. The two &s;i&s;ters, in expre&s;&s;ing their fears, mutually &s;trengthened each other; and the plea|&s;ure that diffu&s;ed it&s;elf over their &s;ouls, made them feel more &s;en&s;ibly the happine&s;s of being beloved.</P>
<P>"By favour of my di&s;gui&s;e, I pre&s;erved a free ac|ce&s;s into the hou&s;e. I con&s;tantly carried the letters of my friend; and I procured him the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing his mi&s;tre&s;s. While thus I continued to re|double all my attentions to Blanche, Timbrio remark|ed, with joy, how well I was beloved, felicitated me, holding me in his arms, &s;wore never to e&s;pou&s;e Ni&s;i|da, until that day that I &s;hould become the hu&s;band of her &s;i&s;ter; I bowed my head, re&s;igned to every thing that Friend&s;hip &s;hould ordain for me.</P>
<P>"We waited now for nothing but news from Spain,
<PB N="41" REF="033741_0073_0FF8F76F5DED8F60">
to demand the hands of Blanche and Ni&s;ida in form; when Pran&s;il, the cavalier, who had the quarrel with Timbrio at Xeres, arrived at Naples, to fight with him.</P>
<P>"The nature of the quarrel was &s;uch, as to render a public reparation nece&s;&s;ary. The Viceroy's permi&s;|&s;ion was to be obtained, and Judges appointed; in fine, all things were fixed, and this terrible combat was to take place in eight days from that time, in a large plain, at a little di&s;tance from the city.</P>
<P>"The news of this made a great noi&s;e, and &s;pread it|&s;elf far and near; in &s;pite of our utmo&s;t precautions, it reached the ear of Ni&s;ida. Her inquietude and grief was as keen as her love was ardent, a prey to &s;i|lent &s;orrow, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed in tears, and without nouri&s;h|ment, the eight days of delay, which &s;eemed to her &s;o long, and yet&mdash;&s;o &s;hort; a frightful incertitude, more cruel even than the misfortune &s;he &s;o much dreaded, &s;oon exhau&s;ted her &s;trength, &s;he fell ill; and her fa|ther, ignorant of the cau&s;e, re&s;olved, in order to re-e&s;|tabli&s;h her health, to bring her to his hou&s;e in the country.</P>
<P>"The day of their departure, which was the eve of the combat, Ni&s;ida had me called to her; when I came near her bed, &s;carcely could I recollect her, I was &s;hocked beyond the power of telling it; I &s;aw her that my &s;oul doated on, pale and worn away, her long dark eye-la&s;hes moi&s;t with tears. Fabian! &s;aid &s;he to me, with a weak and feeble voice, you mu&s;t carry my la&s;t adieus to Timbrio, tell him, that my life is joined to his; and that to-morrow, he has my life to defend. As for you, next to me, his be&s;t
<PB N="42" REF="033741_0074_0FF8F7719F489350">
friend, &s;ure I am, that you will not quit him; &s;hould any mi&s;chance happen, you will be there to &s;uccour him. Ah! would to Heaven, that I had the power to be with you al&s;o&mdash;hold, added &s;he, untying from her neck, a precious relique, which &s;he wet with her tears, carry this to him, and tell him that it has ever pre&s;er|ved me from dangers of every kind; it is to-morrow, . . . that I expect it to pre&s;erve me indeed. I have &s;till one &s;ervice more from you. I am going to my father's country-hou&s;e, which is but half a league from the fatal field;&mdash;promi&s;e me, to come there in&s;tant|ly, and let me know the event of the combat; if my Timbrio be the vanqui&s;her, fa&s;ten this white &s;carf upon thy arm, I &s;hall &s;ee it from far, it will &s;ave me &s;ome moments of torment.&mdash;Should he be overcome &mdash;I &s;hall want thee no more!&mdash;</P>
<P>"You may ea&s;ily conceive, my good friends, what I mu&s;t have &s;uffered during this interview, I promi&s;ed her every thing &s;he a&s;ked. I ran to Timbrio, it elevat|ed his hopes; it redoubled his ardor; he ki&s;&s;ed it, laid it next to his heart, it rai&s;ed him out of him&s;elf; &s;ure of being invincible, he would have defied the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>"At length the moment arrived, the whole city of Naples were already upon the field of battle. Pran&s;il and Timbrio pre&s;ented them&s;elves, they cho&s;e for weapons, the &s;word and poiguard. The barrier is opened, the trumpets &s;ound, and the two enemies ru&s;h upon each other!</P>
<P>"The combat was furious, and for a long time equal. Pran&s;il was active, &s;kilful and valiant; he wounded Timbrio, and Victory hung wavering; eve|ry
<PB N="43" REF="033741_0075_0FF8F77588D006F8">
heart beat with anxiety. At length, Love had the advantage. Timbrio &s;truck Pran&s;il to the ground, no &s;ooner was he down, than my generous friend flung a|way his &s;word, and ran to a&s;&s;i&s;t him; Pran&s;il acknow|ledged him&s;elf vanqui&s;hed, and the &s;pectators rent the air with their applau&s;es.</P>
<P>"The frightful uncertainty that I had been in for &s;o long a time, the grief that I felt, when I &s;aw Timbrio wounded, and the &s;udden joy that ru&s;hed upon my heart for his victory, di&s;turbed my mind &s;o much, that I forgot the white &s;carf, and I ran without it to an|nounce our good fortune to Ni&s;ida. Oh! haple&s;s maiden, O beauteous Ni&s;ida, thy ble&s;t &s;hade, has long ere this, pardoned my cruel inadvertency, and looks with divine compa&s;&s;ion on the &s;orrows of an heart, that never more can feel the ble&s;&s;ing of a moment's peace. As the moment of the combat approached, the fever burned with double violence in her veins; notwith&s;tanding her weakne&s;s, &s;he had her&s;elf carried up to the highe&s;t windows of the hou&s;e; there, &s;up|ported by her women, her eyes fixt upon the road, &s;he waited her life or her death; &s;he perceived me; &s;aw no white &s;carf, and fell motionle&s;s into the arms of her &s;i&s;ter. At this moment, I arrived, all the hou&s;e were in tears; I pre&s;&s;ed thro' to Ni&s;ida, we were prodigal of u&s;ele&s;s &s;uccours, nothing could re&s;tore her! I &s;aw her eyes fa&s;t &s;hut, her mouth open, her lips pale;&mdash; then it was, I began to recollect that I was the cau&s;e of all this ruin, wild with de&s;pair, I ru&s;hed out of the hou&s;e, I dur&s;t no more &s;ee my friend, to whom I was certain of giving his death. De&s;olate in mind, furi|ous and di&s;tracted, I took the fir&s;t road that I found;
<PB N="44" REF="033741_0076_0FF8F777C9AE7078">
I had not gone far, when I heard a loud voice calling after me to &s;top.&mdash;I turned round, it was Felix, the page of Timbrio, who told me to come quickly to his ma&s;ter; Felix, &s;aid I, thy ma&s;ter I &s;hall never &s;ee again; Ni&s;ida is dead, and it is I who have killed her. In pronouncing the&s;e words, I redoubled my &s;peed. I arrive at Gaietta, a ve&s;&s;el is pulling before the wind, for Spain; I embark, I arrive once more in my native country, where I have taken this habit, which I &s;hall now never quit.</P>
<P>"You have had, my friends, a faithful recital of my misfortunes. I had hoped to find peace in this hermi|tage, alas! I have found nothing but &s;olitude. In vain I force my&s;elf to turn my thoughts to that Great Being, that ought to occupy them intirely. The re|membrance of what I have lo&s;t, pur&s;ues me uncea&s;|ingly. I &s;ay to my&s;elf every day, that I ought to for|get Ni&s;ida and Timbrio, and every day I weep their lo&s;s."</P>
<P>The &s;hepherds were unable to con&s;ole the hermit; but they joined in his &s;orrows. And now the night being far advanced, and the moon at the height of her cour&s;e, the &s;hepherds took their leaves of Fabian, and quitting the hermitage, &s;oon arrived at the cottage of Elicio; where, after a frugal meal, they &s;tretched them&s;elves upon the &s;oft &s;kins of goats, to enjoy that re&s;t which temperance and exerci&s;e never fail to be|&s;tow.</P>
<P>When Elicio perceived that his companions were fa&s;t a&s;leep, he ro&s;e up, and went &s;oftly out to execute a project which he had meditated all day.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t before his door there was a beautiful cherry-tree,
<PB N="45" REF="033741_0077_0FF8F77AB2CB3838">
which he had him&s;elf reared, and which was covered with the fine&s;t fruit in the country, though yet very young, and the &s;tem &s;lender, it afforded delicacies to its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; two white doves had cho&s;en it to build in, they had placed their ne&s;t near the top, in a forked part of the tree formed by four branches;&mdash;far from di&s;turbing them, Elicio looked upon it as an happy omen, their coming to build &s;o near his cottage; he of|ten carried under the cherry-tree, ears of corn and hemp-&s;eed, and even wool for the doves to line the in&s;ide of their ne&s;ts with, and that their little ones might lie more &s;oft.</P>
<P>While Elicio was at the nuptials of Sylveria, a &s;er|vant of Meoris, came and &s;pread his nets over the cherry-tree, took the turtles and carried them in&s;tant|ly to his ma&s;ter's daughter. They were the &s;ame that Galatea had let e&s;cape, and Elicio who knew them, had promi&s;ed his &s;hepherde&s;s that they &s;hould return to her again.</P>
<P>He was willing to keep his word, he went out of his cottage to &s;eize on the father and mother while they were a&s;leep, and to put them into a cage with their young ones; by the help of a ladder which he laid again&s;t the chimney of his cottage, he mounted to the highe&s;t branch, &s;tooped his body forward, removed &s;oftly the leaves, and &s;aw by the light of the moon, the two turtles in the ne&s;t, the head under one wing, and the other wing &s;pread out, the better to cover their little ones. They did not waken, and Elicio had no more to do than to take them, but he had not the cour|age; no, &s;aid he, dear charming birds, ye &s;hall not be deprived of your liberty, you &s;hall belong to Galatea
<PB N="46" REF="033741_0078_0FF8F77F93753B50">
without being &s;laves; you &s;hall live near her, though free to live el&s;ewhere. He de&s;cended quickly from the ladder, ran to &s;eek a &s;pade, and coming back to the cherry-tree, he dug a trench round about it, and when it was held only by its bottom roots, he cautiou&s;ly and without the lea&s;t violence, placed his &s;pade horizon|tally, and cutting the roots, loo&s;ened it entirely from the ground; then, he took it in his arms, lifted it &s;oft|ly out of the trench, and with a &s;low, but firm &s;tep, which &s;carcely agitated the branches, he gained the cottage of Galatea.</P>
<P>The chamber where &s;he &s;lept had a window, that looked into the fields, before this window he laid down his burden, with the utmo&s;t precaution; the tree &s;tood firm and upright, &s;upported by the ball of clay which was attached to its roots. Elicio, who had taken care to carry his &s;pade with him, dug a hole, &s;et his beloved cherry-tree in it, and placed it in &s;uch a manner as to have the ne&s;t oppo&s;ite the window, and &s;o near, that Galatea by &s;tretching out her hand, might be able to care&s;s the little turtles. Plea&s;ed with his work, he looked to &s;ee if he had not di&s;turbed the doves, they had been ju&s;t awakened, he could di&s;tin|gui&s;h their head, which they had &s;tretched out now upon the mo&s;s of their ne&s;t. Pardon me, &s;aid he to them, pardon me, gentle birds, if I have di&s;turbed your &s;leep; 'tis for your good, as well as my happine&s;s, you are now Galatea's; as &s;oon as &s;he opens her window, fly upon her &s;houlder, peek at her beaute|ous hair, teach your little ones to love and care&s;s your mi&s;tre&s;s, when I know that you are near her, I &s;hall not regret you; but &s;hould a rival ever pre&s;ent him|&s;elf
<PB N="47" REF="033741_0079_0FF8C194D489B4A8">
at this window, Oh! fly away, con&s;tant birds, come and find me again; when I hear thy melancho|ly murmurs on my cottage, I will &s;oon join my &s;ad complaints to thine.</P>
<P>The dawn now began to appear, and the &s;wallows were already twittering upon the chimney of Galatea when Elicio, with his &s;pade on his &s;houlder, took the way to his cottage. He had not gone far, when he heard &s;ome one walking after him, he looked back, it was Meoris, the father of Galatea. Elicio trembled when he &s;aw him, as if had been con&s;cious of doing a bad action; but Meoris &s;oon &s;et him at re&s;t, for he did not even que&s;tion him as to the rea&s;on of his hav|ing been &s;o early in the village.&mdash;Elicio, &s;aid he to him, I was going to you; I have a &s;ecret to entru&s;t you with, and I have a piece of &s;ervice to demand from you, in which my daughter is nearly concered.&mdash;The &s;hepherd, full of joy, ki&s;&s;ed the old man's hands with tran&s;port.</P>
<P>They then retired into a little wood of myrtles, at &s;ome di&s;tance from the road.</P>

<P>The &s;hepherds, alarmed by the&s;e tender plaints, ran towards Elicio, they found him &s;itting beneath a beech, his face bathed in tears. Scarce had he perceived them, when ri&s;ing up ha&s;tily, he ran and threw him|&s;elf on the neck of Era&s;tres. My friend, &s;aid he, we are going to lo&s;e Galatea; alas! &s;he quits us for|ever! li&s;ten, added he, looking on Tircis and Damon, to the &s;ad &s;ecret that Meoris has this morning made me the confidant of; I am going to repeat it to you, in his own words.</P>
<P>"Elicio, &s;aid he to me, I owe you the utmo&s;t grati|tude for the attachment you have ever &s;howed me, and you are the fir&s;t to whom I confide the intended mar|riage of my daughter; I concluded all la&s;t night, &s;he is to wed a rich Portugue&s;e, who&s;e numerous flocks cover the banks of the Lima; four &s;hepherds &s;ent by the future &s;pou&s;e, are now at my hou&s;e, and to-morrow they depart with Galatea; I know you ever had the affection of a brother for her, and I have therefore made choice of thee, my dear Elicio, and do be&s;eech you to accompany her to Portugal, to be pre&s;ent at her
<PB N="51" REF="033741_0084_0FF8F78CA8489B58">
marriage, and to bring me back the certain intelligence of her happine&s;s."</P>
<P>In &s;pight of the &s;orrow that his di&s;cour&s;e overwhelm|ed me with, I recovered my voice &s;ufficiently to reply to him. How! &s;aid I, have you been able to con|&s;ent to &s;eparate your&s;elf now in your old age, from your only child? Have you had the heart to condemn her to live far from her father and her friends? Are you very certain that you will not be the cau&s;e of mi&s;|ery to her, by thus exiling her into a &s;trange land? Do you not think but &s;he will regret . . . . ?&mdash;I have founded the heart of my daughter, &s;aid Meoris, interrupting me, I have made her acquainted with my intentions: &s;he replied to me with her u&s;ual gentlene&s;s that &s;he would be always ready to obey me. I di&s;cov|ered, even in her countenance a &s;light emotion, the certain mark of that joy, which the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible and mode&s;t girl feels when &s;he is going to be married. Do not therefore be unea&s;y about her unhappine&s;s, but go and prepare your&s;elf for the journey; I expect it from your friend&s;hip.&mdash;Behold, my friends, what Meoris &s;aid to me, behold that event, which I dread|ed more than death.</P>
<P>Tircis, Damon, and above all, Era&s;tres, afflicted them&s;elves with Elicio.&mdash;But, &s;aid Damon to him, &s;ince Meoris e&s;teems and loves you, how comes it that you have never been tempted to make an avowal of your pa&s;&s;ion, and demand Galatea in marriage of him? You do not, &s;aid Elicio, know him as well as I do, he has repeatedly declared that his &s;on-in-law mu&s;t have wealth equal to what he can give his daugh|ter. If I dur&s;t have &s;poken to him, he would have
<PB N="52" REF="033741_0085_0FF8F78FA62B87B8">
believed that it was her fortune I loved, and his friend&s;hip for me would have been changed into con|tempt. Meoris is too rich not to be mi&s;tru&s;tful, and I am too poor to be confident.</P>
<P>My friend, &s;aid Tircis, do not lo&s;e all hope, let us go and find Galatea, let us know from her&s;elf if it be true &s;he con&s;ents to marry this Portugue&s;e, and if, as I &s;u&s;|pect, that it will wound her deeply to obey her father, we will endeavour to break this unfortunate marriage. Love and Friend&s;hip will in&s;pire us, &s;ingly they have worked miracles; what will they not do when united?</P>
<P>Elicio followed the coun&s;el of Tircis; the four &s;hep|herds took the road to the fountain of Ardoi&s;es, where Galatea retired in the extreme heat of the day; they hoped to find her there, nor was their expectation de|ceived; the &s;hepherde&s;s was &s;itting near the edge of the water, and in &s;o profound a reverie, that &s;he did not perceive the &s;hepherds when they approached; her eyes, moi&s;t with tears, were fixed upon the fountain, her head reclined on one of her hands, with the other the care&s;&s;ed the dog of Elicio; this dog, that for a long time had been oftener with her than with his ma&s;ter. The faithful animal &s;at at the feet of Galatea, his head was laid upon her knees, his eyes fixed on hers, and his air &s;eemed wi&s;tfully to demand of her, why he was this day care&s;&s;ed more than u&s;ual.</P>
<P>Elicio made his companions &s;top, that he might enjoy this plea&s;ing &s;ight; a &s;oft &s;atisfaction replaced already the grief that was painted upon his counte|nance.</P>
<P>Galatea, who believed her&s;elf alone with the dog, began to &s;ing the&s;e words:&mdash;</P>

<P>The tears that Galatea &s;hed, prevented farther ut|terance; Elicio wept al&s;o, but his were tears of joy; he was no longer ma&s;ter of his tran&s;ports, he ran to the &s;hepherde&s;s, fell upon his knees before her, and &s;eizing one of her hands, pre&s;&s;ed it to his lips; Gala|tea thus &s;urpri&s;ed, made ineffectual efforts to get away, &s;he perceived that the other &s;hepherds were

looking at her, &s;he would have appeared angry, but &s;he could not, &s;he would have fled, but the dog hin|dered her, jumping and running round her, and al|ternately care&s;&s;ing them both&mdash;one would have &s;aid, that he enjoyed the happine&s;s which he was procuring to his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>Tircis, Damon, and even Era&s;tres, beheld this &s;cene with tenderne&s;s, and dur&s;t not approach the two lovers.&mdash;Galatea called them to her, made Elicio ri&s;e, and endeavouring to dry up her tears; I can no longer pretend, &s;aid &s;he to them, to hide a &s;ecret my imprudence has betrayed; yes, I regret my country, and I leave, perhaps, my heart in it, but I am not the le&s;s re&s;olved to obey my father; the &s;acred duty that I owe him will &s;upport me in every trial. I conjure you not to double, by your &s;orrows, a grief that would be u&s;ele&s;s, and above all, not to di&s;turb a &s;olitude be|come nece&s;&s;ary to me, after the avowal I have ju&s;t made.&mdash;At the&s;e words, &s;he bent her &s;teps towards the village, leaving the four &s;hepherds immoveable with &s;urpri&s;e; the dog of Elicio alone dur&s;t follow her, &s;he perceived him, and would have hindered him by threatening him with her crook, but the dog &s;till fawned at her feet, and the poor Galatea could not bring her&s;elf either to beat him or drive him away.</P>
<P>The four friends &s;taid together, holding council upon the mo&s;t likely manner of breaking this fatal marriage;&mdash;Tircis advi&s;ed to have all the &s;hepherds of the country a&s;&s;embled together, to go in a body, and &s;upplicate Meoris not to part with that trea&s;ure which was the pride of them all. Damon was for going to Portugal to menace the future &s;pou&s;e, and
<PB N="55" REF="033741_0088_0FF8F7968184B7B8">
terrify him, &s;o that he &s;hould of him&s;elf, renounce Galatea. Elicio inclined to this part; No, no, re|plied the good Era&s;tres, who had been as yet &s;ilent, none of the&s;e expedients will &s;erve any purpo&s;e but to irritate Meoris; I have a project which will not fail to render every one happy&mdash;except my&s;elf, I have re&s;olved on it, and will go and in&s;tantly put it in practice. In &s;aying the&s;e words, he embraced Elicio, and departed.</P>
<P>The &s;hepherds, who did not reckon much on the invention of &s;o &s;imple a man as Era&s;tres, propo&s;ed to go and con&s;ult the hermit Fabian.&mdash;They had already proceeded on their way, when they were met by a cavalier &s;uperbly clothed, and mounted on a noble hor&s;e; two ladies on jennets, were by his &s;ide, and the numerous troop of &s;ervants which followed, &s;howed them to be per&s;ons of di&s;tinction;&mdash;The &s;hep|herds &s;aluted them as they pa&s;&s;ed, the cavalier re|turned their civility, and &s;topping Elicio&mdash;Have the goodne&s;s, &s;hepherd, &s;aid he to him, to direct us to &s;ome convenient place in the&s;e fore&s;ts, where we may pa&s;s a few hours; the ladies whom you &s;ee, are fa|tigued with the heat and the length of the journey, and would be willing to re&s;t them&s;elves here. Elicio, who always forgot his own concern in the wi&s;h to oblige others, conducted them to the fountain of Ardoi&s;es, which was only a few paces di&s;tant.</P>
<P>When they arrived there, the &s;erv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nts &s;pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d a ta|ble, which they &s;oon covered with refre&s;hments.

<PB N="56" REF="033741_0089_0FF8F7981FA89D40">
of the two&mdash;but perhaps, &s;he would not have had this advantage, but for the deep &s;orrow that cloud|ed the features of her younger &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Elicio now pre&s;&s;ed his companions to depart for the hermitage, but the cavalier detaining them, &s;aid, let me enjoy a little longer the happine&s;s I feel in meeting with you; it would be my wi&s;h to live with &s;hepherds &mdash;What a difference between your happy condition, and that of the inhabitants of towns, Nature has given you for nothing tho&s;e plea&s;ures, of which we purcha&s;e the image. Indolence &s;hortens our days; Labour prolongs yours. Deceit, La&s;&s;itude, and perpetual con&s;traint is the round we live in. Freedom, Mirth, Content and Sincerity mark your happy lives;&mdash;this day I would turn a &s;hepherd, if Ni&s;ida would become a &s;hepherde&s;s.</P>
<P>At the name of Ni&s;ida, Elicio looked at the two women with a countenance expre&s;&s;ive of &s;o much a&s;toni&s;hment, that it was remarked by the cavalier. Pardon me, &s;aid Elicio, if the name of Ni&s;ida has made &s;o vi&s;ible an impre&s;&s;ion on me;&mdash;it is not long &s;ince one of our friends &s;hed many tears, in talking to us of Ni&s;ida. Have you then, &s;aid the cavalier, any &s;hepherde&s;s who is thus called? No, replied Eli|cio, &s;he that I mean is no &s;hepherde&s;s; &s;he is not even of the&s;e parts, Naples is her country. How! do you then know? I will explain it to you &s;aid Elicio, but fir&s;t tell me if your name be not Timbrio;&mdash;and if this young per&s;on be not Blanche, the &s;i&s;ter of Ni&s;ida. You have indeed, &s;aid the cavalier, mentioned their names. Ah! Fabian, Fabian, what an happy day for you!&mdash;Is he then here, cried Blanche, and as &s;he
<PB N="57" REF="033741_0090_0FF8F79BB2996268">
&s;poke, the palene&s;s of her face was in&s;tantly effaced by a deep and brilliant red.</P>
<P>Yes, replied Elicio, he is here, and the mi&s;ery of having lo&s;t you, was near putting an end to a life that he has now con&s;ecrated to penitence. Fabian is an hermit, and his hermitage is near this. Let us fly and embrace him, &s;aid Timbrio; Blanche, &s;tarted up, and in&s;tantly &s;et off without knowing the road &s;he was to take. Ni&s;ida leaned on the arm of her lover; and Tircis, Damon and Elicio, guided them towards the hermitage.</P>
<P>It was almo&s;t night when they arrived at the foot of the hill. Timbrio, Ni&s;ida, and above all, young Blanche, mounted the hill by the winding path, with|out ever taking breath. When they came to the door of the hermitage, they found it open, they look|ed in, but could &s;ee no one in the cell; unea&s;y at not finding him there, they were going to call and to run and &s;eek him over the hill. The prudent Tircis &s;topped them. Fabian, &s;aid he, is without doubt, near this place; but this unhappy friend, who has not even an hope of ever &s;eeing you more;&mdash;who laments you without cea&s;ing, would die with joy, &s;hould you &s;uddenly pre&s;ent your&s;elves to his view, manage it &s;o as to re&s;train your tran&s;ports, and we will find the means to prepare his &s;oul to receive a plea&s;ure which it could not otherwi&s;e &s;u&s;tain.</P>
<P>Every one approved the advice of Tircis, they a|greed that it was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end forward the &s;hep|herds, that they might announce to Fabian with pre|caution, the arrival of tho&s;e tender friends, that he was once more going to behold again.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="033741_0091_0FF8F79D538DBCC0">Whil&s;t they were thus con&s;ulting, Blanche was con&s;idering, by the light of the moon, the in&s;ide of the cell; a mat of ru&s;hes, a &s;tool and a crucifix of box-wood, was all the furniture that Fabian had. Blanche examined them a long while, &s;he then drew near the crucifix, and throwing her&s;elf on her knees before it, in a low voice, poured out her thanks to Heaven, for having conducted her to the hermitage.</P>
<P>Timbrio and the &s;hepherds were regarding with looks of tenderne&s;s, this affecting &s;ight; when deep &s;ighs and the plaintive voice of &s;orrow gave them to under&s;tand that Fabian was not far off: they per|ceived the hermit under a wild olive, on his knees, upon the fragment of a rock, his arms &s;pread to Hea|ven. At this &s;ight, the two &s;i&s;ters and Timbrio would have thrown-them&s;elves upon his neck; Tircis was unable to re&s;train them: but Fabian beginning to pray, they all &s;topped to li&s;ten. Ni&s;ida and Timbrio remained with their arms extended forward; Blanche &s;carcely re&s;piring, rai&s;ed her head over their &s;houl|ders, and endeavoured every in&s;tant to wipe away the tears which prevented her almo&s;t from &s;eeing her lover.</P>
<P>God of all mercy, &s;aid Fabian, Being Supreme, whom only I ought to love, Thou who fille&s;t this world, and &s;hould fill my heart, be not offended at my tears.&mdash;I have lo&s;t all&mdash;I do not murmur&mdash;Oh! my God, calm the agonies that I &s;uffer, but do not re|move from me entirely the remembrance of my misfortunes.</P>
<P>When Fabian began his prayer, Blanche wept in
<PB N="59" REF="033741_0092_0FF8F6A1169E4880">
&s;ilence; but at the la&s;t words, &s;he cried aloud. Tir|cis, fearing that &s;he would be heard, de&s;ired Damon to go with Elicio, and interrupt the hermit,&mdash;while he remained with Timbrio and the two &s;i&s;ters, to hinder them from &s;howing them&s;elves too &s;uddenly.</P>
<P>The two &s;hepherds obeyed, Fabian received them with kindne&s;s: you complain always, &s;aid Elicio, and your misfortunes perhaps draw to a conclu&s;ion. You are acquainted with them, replied the hermit, judge then if they can ever end; without doubt they might, &s;aid Elicio; you &s;aw Ni&s;ida under the appear|ance of death, but you are not &s;ure that &s;he was real|ly dead.&mdash;What if &s;he were alive? Ah! impo&s;&s;ible. On the contrary, replied Elicio, I heard this day, that &s;he and her &s;i&s;ter, together with Timbrio, have been uncea&s;ingly occupied in &s;earching all Spain, in hopes of finding you. What &s;ay you? are you very cer|tain that this is my friend? that the&s;e are the two &s;i&s;|ters!&mdash;Ah! do not &s;port with an unfortunate, have pity on my &s;orrows, and do not come to agitate me, by abu&s;ing me with a fal&s;e hope.</P>
<P>As he &s;aid the&s;e words, Tircis &s;poke to Ni&s;ida, and advi&s;ed her if &s;he could recollect any &s;ong, to &s;ing it in the place where &s;he then &s;tood, without as yet, of|fering her&s;elf to the eyes of the hermit.</P>
<P>Ni&s;ida followed his coun&s;el, and began the fir&s;t couplet of a &s;ong that Fabian had formerly made.</P>
<LG>
<L>Friend&s;hip, thy empire now regain,</L>

<L>He is the &s;oul's delicious plea&s;ure,</L>
<L>But thou its be&s;t, its &s;ure&s;t trea&s;ure.</L>
</LG>
<P>Fabian was yet &s;peaking, when the voice of Ni&s;ida &s;truck his ears; he &s;topped, he li&s;tened, he remains immoveable! his eyes are fixed and his mouth open, pre&s;ently looking with a wild air, his rea&s;on abandons him; terror is painted on his face, he takes the &s;hep|herds for phantoms, and views them with affright! In the mean time, the voice continued, it penetrated to the bottom of his &s;oul. By little and little his fears are di&s;&s;ipated, his features regain their &s;weetne&s;s, his eyes recover their &s;oftne&s;s; he comes to him&s;elf, darts like an arrow to the place from whence the voice came, and fell motionle&s;s into the arms of his friend.</P>
<P>Ni&s;ida and Timbrio call out, the &s;hepherds ran to them, they are all anxiou&s;ly employed in endeavouring to bring him to life; Blanche had already flown to &s;eek for water in his cell, &s;he threw it on his face, &s;he held his hands in hers, <Q>And viewed him with all the mingled agonies of hopes and fears.</Q>
At length he recovers his &s;en&s;es, he opens his eyes, but is &s;till doubtful of his good fortune. Is it you then indeed? &s;aid he to Timbrio, is it you whom I have wept and &s;orrowed for &s;o long? Yes&punc; it is me, it is thy friend, who owes his life to thee. They em|brace each other, they mingle their tears together, and
<PB N="61" REF="033741_0094_0FF8F7A439C28B78">
remain a long time locked in each other's arms. No more of grief, &s;aid Timbrio to him, we are all re-uni|ted: behold Ni&s;ida thy good friend, and Blanche, who would have died if we had not found thee.&mdash;What more could you de&s;ire? Ah! nothing, replied the hermit &s;miling, and weeping at the &s;ame time. Blanche and Ni&s;ida held out their arms to him; Fabi|an would have &s;poken, but he made vain efforts; he took the hands of the two &s;i&s;ters, and joining them both together on his brea&s;t, fell on his knees, and bathed their hands with his tears.</P>
<P>After this tender &s;cene, Fabian led his friends into his cell, and there gave them a detail of all that hap|pened to him &s;ince their &s;eparation; the recital was &s;hort. The prudent Fabian, always the victim of friend&s;hip, &s;poke of his love for Blanche, as the &s;en|timent that had mo&s;t occupied him during his &s;olitude; the happy Blanche was unable to &s;peak, but &s;he em|braced her &s;i&s;ter, and dropped the tears of glad|ne&s;s upon her bo&s;om.</P>
<P>The hermit now entreated his friend to relate to them in his turn, all his adventures from the moment that he left him on the field of battle, to go and car|ry the news of his victory to Ni&s;ida. The &s;hepherds all joined with him in the &s;ame reque&s;t; and Timbrio willing to oblige, began thus:&mdash;</P>
<P>"After my combat with Pran&s;il, impatient to &s;ee Fabian again, I &s;ent my page to the country-hou&s;e of Ni&s;ida; he came back with terror in his looks, and announced to me, the death of my mi&s;tre&s;s, and the flight of my friend, &s;tunned as if by a &s;troke of thun|der,
<PB N="62" REF="033741_0095_0FF8F7A5DB67F9D8">
I in&s;tantly departed to inform my&s;elf of the full extent of my misfortunes. I arrived at the country, hou&s;e, but neither intreaties, pre&s;ents, nor &s;upplica|tions, could gain me an entrance; while the di&s;|cour&s;e and tears of the dome&s;tics, confirmed me in the belief of Ni&s;ida's being no more.</P>
<P>"It would be impo&s;&s;ible for me to tell you what my thoughts were at that moment; &s;urely one can|not die of grief, or I &s;hould have expired on the &s;pot. &mdash;In the mid&s;t of my de&s;pair, I remembered that there &s;till remained to me a friend, and all wounded as I was, I followed his tracks to Gaietta; when I ar|rived in that city, I was forced to wait the departure of a Catalonian ve&s;&s;el that was to return in a few days to Barcelona, the captain received me on board, and my affliction redoubled as we quit the &s;hores of Italy, where I had lo&s;t the deare&s;t object of my heart.</P>
<P>"The wind, which was at fir&s;t favourable to us, fell all of a &s;udden, and our ve&s;&s;el but little removed from the &s;hore, was almo&s;t motionle&s;s with the calm; I &s;hould have &s;een a tempe&s;t with more plea&s;ure. Uncea&s;ingly occupied with my mi&s;eries, always weep|ing my lo&s;t Ni&s;ida, I be&s;ought Heaven that I might die or find my friend. Now my la&s;t re&s;ource, the only moments that I found le&s;s bitter, were tho&s;e that I &s;pent playing on a lute, belonging to one of the pa&s;|&s;engers, and accompanying it with my voice.</P>
<P>"The &s;econd day of our departure, in the moment when the morn began to glow in the horizon, I was &s;itting upon the poop, viewing the va&s;t &s;ea, who&s;e tranquil waves reflected the &s;tars, now ready to di&s;ap|pear; all was hu&s;hed around me, the officers and &s;ai|lors

The &s;ails were furled, one heard no noi&s;e but what the prow of the ve&s;&s;el made, as it moved &s;oftly through the water. This profound &s;ilence, this grand &s;pectacle of the &s;ea and the heavens; Aurora, that came gently on to revive the unfortu|nate, made me but more keenly feel my &s;orrows.

<P>"I was in the la&s;t ver&s;e when I heard the noi&s;e of oars, which &s;eemed to approach the &s;hip; I li&s;tened, I looked, the fir&s;t rays of the morn enabled me to di&s;tingui&s;h a bark, &s;he came right upon us, while the efforts of four rowers made her fly upon the &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="033741_0097_0FF8FBDE43801670">"When the bark approached us, a woman &s;tood upon the deck, and addre&s;&s;ed me. In the name of Heaven, cried &s;he, have the goodne&s;s to tell me if your ve&s;&s;el be not the Catalan that &s;ailed a few days &s;ince from Gaietta. Judge of my a&s;toni&s;hment, it was the voice of Blanche, the &s;i&s;ter of my Ni&s;ida. Ah! my &s;i&s;ter! cried I, as by the help of a rope I de&s;cended like lightning into the bark, I flew to throw my&s;elf into the arms of Blanche, and I found my&s;elf in tho&s;e of Ni&s;ida.</P>
<P>"I thought I &s;hould have died with joy; immove|able and mute, I had not the power to utter a word. Ni&s;ida &s;poke to me, encouraged me; I looked at her and trembled in the apprehen&s;ion that this was but a dream, and that my happine&s;s would di&s;appear on my awaking.</P>
<P>"Recovered from my fir&s;t tran&s;ports of joy, my next care was to get the tender Ni&s;ida and her amiable &s;i&s;ter into the &s;hip; they were both in the habits of pilgrims, but the captain, in&s;tructed by me, received them with the re&s;pect that was due to their birth. It was then that I learned from Blanche, how Fabian's forgetting the &s;carf had thrown her &s;i&s;ter, who was weakened down with illne&s;s, into &s;o deep a &s;woon that every one believed her to be dead; &s;he did not come to her&s;elf, till the end of eight hours, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">arning then of my victory,&mdash;my error&mdash;my de&s;pair, and our flight, &s;he re&s;olved with her &s;i&s;ter, to quit all and follow us. Neither her illne&s;s nor her weakne&s;s could detain her, &s;he was determined to go, and Blanche di&s;po&s;ed every thing for their departure. They had gold and jewels, they were prodigal of all

that they might e&s;cape from their father's hou&s;e. A dome&s;tic that had been gained over, brought them a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ter in the middle of the night. The two &s;i&s;ters, furni&s;hed with diamonds, and di&s;gui&s;ed as pilgrims, took the road to Gaietta, where they knew that I had gone. They arrived two days after the departure of the &s;hip, by dint of money they procured rowers, who endeavoured to overtake us; the calm unex|pectedly &s;econded their efforts&mdash;and Love, who doubtle&s;s protected the&s;e amiable &s;i&s;ters, conducted them without any accident to our ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>"I found my Ni&s;ida, but you were wanting to us, my dear Fabian, and this was paying very dear for the favours that we received from Fortune. Blanche felt this as &s;en&s;ibly as I did, thy ab&s;ence was all that we had to lament.</P>
<P>"After an happy voyage we arrived at Barcelona, we had hopes of learning &s;omething of you there, but our re&s;earches were vain. Blanche was the fir&s;t to mention that we &s;hould travel over all Spain, and never re&s;t till we had found thee, &s;he was very &s;ure that this advice would be followed; we re&s;olved to go fir&s;t to Toledo, where the relations of Ni&s;ida live, we wrote to her father, acquainting him with our adventures, and a&s;king his permi&s;&s;ion for us to be married at To|ledo; he replied as we would have wi&s;hed, and we were now on our way to that city, &s;till inquiring with painful anxiety for our dear Fabian, when our good fortune conducted us here."</P>
<P>Such was the hi&s;tory of Timbrio. As &s;oon as he had cea&s;ed to &s;peak, the hermit took him by him&s;elf into a corner of his cell, and &s;aid to him with a timid

voice, Is it nece&s;&s;ary for me to go al&s;o to Toledo? Timbrio, &s;urpri&s;ed at his que&s;tion, looked at him, Fabian threw down his eyes and let &s;ome tears e&s;cape him. His friend held him in his arms; yes &s;aid he, his very nece&s;&s;ary that you &s;hould come to Toledo, to e&s;pou&s;e thy dear Blanche, &s;he adores thee; never has &s;he been one in&s;tant without thinking of thee, You loved her always. Is it not true? More than my life, replied Fabian, but I love thee &s;till more; come, added he &s;miling, I &s;hall quit this habit of an hermit, and you mu&s;t find me one more proper for a bridegroom; but if you will be advi&s;ed by me, when we &s;hall be united to the&s;e two charming &s;i&s;ters, we will come back here and live with the&s;e good &s;hepherds, who love us, and who de&s;erve that we &s;hould love them. I have already formed the project, replied Timbrio, I am tired of the parade of the world, and I would wi&s;h to fini&s;h my life in the&s;e &s;weet retreats, and enjoy what yet remains of it between my wife and my friend.</P>
<P>After this conver&s;ation they came back, and gave an account of it to the two &s;i&s;ters and the &s;hepherds; every one &s;eemed delighted, and applauded the de&s;ign.</P>
<P>In the mean time the night advanced, Elicio advi&s;ed them to ha&s;ten to the village; I have no hou&s;e, &s;uch as would accommodate you, &s;aid he, to the four lovers, but I will conduct you to that of Galatea; Meoris her father, will feel him&s;elf honoured by re|ceiving you.</P>
<P>His advice is followed, they &s;et out, they double their pace, they arrive; Meoris was going to &s;it
<PB N="67" REF="033741_0100_0FF8C1FA17244D18">
down at table, with his daughter&punc; Flori&s;e, Teolinda and the four &s;hepherds from Portugal, who were the next day to carry Galatea along with them; they knock at the door, the dogs bark, Meoris went to open it him&s;elf; Elicio demands from him an ho&s;pitable reception for Ni&s;ida, Blanche and the two friends; the old <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hepherd, honoured by &s;uch gue&s;ts, received them with re&s;pect, he called his daughter, and made her add to the &s;upper whatever was good in the hou&s;e, and inviting them to &s;it down to table, made excu&s;es for what they had; giving them to under&s;tand that better fare would have been provided, had they been expected.</P>
<P>During &s;upper Galatea endeavoured all in her power to hide the grief that preyed on her heart. Elicio placed him&s;elf as far off from the Portugue&s;e as he could, he viewed them with rage;&mdash;and &s;ome|times his eyes met tho&s;e of Galatea. The repa&s;t being ended, they all ro&s;e from table, and went to enjoy the cooling fre&s;hne&s;s of the air, upon the &s;tone benches which were at the door of the hou&s;e. Old Meoris was willing to recount to his gue&s;ts the brilliant marriage which he was making for his daughter; he dwelt upon the riches of his intended &s;on-in-law, riches which the Portugue&s;e did not fail to exaggerate. The two friends, and the two &s;i&s;ters, thought them|&s;elves bound to felicitate Galatea, &s;he made no reply; and the unhappy Elicio devoured his tears. Suddenly they were alarmed with the di&s;mal &s;ound of a trumpet, which was heard in the village.</P>
<P>Meoris, his gue&s;ts, and all the inhabitants ran to the public green, from whence the &s;ad &s;ounds &s;eemed
<PB N="68" REF="033741_0101_0FF8FB0F77623CE8">
to proceed, they perceived four men cloathed in mourn|ing, and crowned with cypre&s;s, two of them carried lighted flambeaus in their hands, the two others &s;ounded the trumpets, in the mid&s;t of the four was a mini&s;ter of the Eternal, cloathed in his &s;acerdotal robes.</P>
<P>This was the venerable Salvadore, the pa&s;tor of the &s;hepherds, who con&s;oled them under their misfor|tunes, and who returned thanks to Heaven for their happine&s;s; all the village was his family, all the orphans his children; for forty years he had filled the &s;ublime employment of prai&s;ing God, and being &s;erviceable to man.</P>
<P>Shepherds, &s;aid he to them, to-morrow is the day that I have cho&s;en in this year, to honor the a&s;hes of our brothers in the valley of tombs; think on this &s;acred duty, and at the earlie&s;t dawn a&s;&s;emble your|&s;elves at this place, in the &s;ad apparel &s;uitable to this intere&s;ting occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>After having with a &s;trong voice pronounced the&s;e words, Salvadore took the road to his own hou&s;e. Every one agreed to meet there at the point of day, to fulfil &s;o holy a duty; Meoris was not willing that his daughter &s;hould be ab&s;ent. He prayed the Portu|gue&s;e that they would defer their departure. Elicio bounded with joy, and Galatea conceived &s;omething like Hope, to flutter in the bottom of her heart.</P>
<P>Ni&s;ida, Blanche, Teolinda, and the two friends, reque&s;ted of the inhabitants of the village permi&s;&s;ion&punc; to accompany them to the valley of tombs. They were flattered with their demand. The four Portu|gue&s;e then &s;olicited the &s;ame favour; but they were

How delicious are tho&s;e moments in which, &s;eparated from the world, alone with our hearts and remembrance only, we retire into our&s;elves, or rather fill our mind with the dear idea of the object of our affections; what a plea&s;ure to recall the various aeras of progre&s;&s;ive love; the fir&s;t hour we have felt that pa&s;&s;ion, the fir&s;t avowal we have made of it, the air with which that avowal was heard, the fears, the &s;u&s;picions, and even

the quarrels all are pre&s;ent, all are traced with delight, we enjoy anew the plea&s;ures we have experienced, we enjoy even the di&s;quietudes we have &s;uffered. If every hope be torn from the heart, if unpitying death has cut off in the hour of youth and beauty, the object of our love; the tears which we give to her memory have charms, the recollection of her &s;till leaves upon our hearts an impre&s;&s;ion of happine&s;s; we would perhaps be more de&s;erving of pity if it were po&s;&s;ible we could be con&s;oled.</P>
<P>Thus thought the wi&s;e Salvadore; he con&s;ecrated one day in the year to tears of tender recollections of Friend&s;hip and of Love. This day was now come, Salvadore, cloathed in his &s;able ve&s;tment, appeared on the green; &s;oon after him came the inhabitants of the village covered with crapes, crowned with cypre&s;s and carrying their crooks bound round with black ribbands. Salvadore regulated the order of the march, he &s;eparated the &s;hepherds from the &s;hep|herde&s;&s;es, and ranged them in two files.</P>
<P>On the right moved Ni&s;ida, Blanche, Teolinda, Flori&s;e; and the young maidens moved under the conduct of Galatea. On the left &s;ide oppo&s;ite the&s;e marched Timbrio, Fabian, Damon, Tircis, and all the young lads, having Elicio at their head, Era&s;tres alone was ab&s;ent. After the&s;e came the married women conducted by Sylveria, and their hu&s;bands led by Daranio; this happy troop were almo&s;t as hand&s;ome as the fir&s;t, they were followed by a third, le&s;s brilliant indeed, but more re&s;pectable, the&s;e were the widows and the old men, they were guided by Meoris and the mother of Era&s;tres; they wore no

crowns, but their white hair gave them an intere&s;ting and affecting appearance, their trembling hands carried ebony &s;ticks, with which they &s;upported them&s;elves. Alas! it was to the&s;e above all, that the ceremony was affecting; they went to weep upon the tomb of a child, a &s;i&s;ter, a wife, or an hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Salvadore clo&s;ed the march, he had cho&s;en this place, to be near the mo&s;t unhappy; at each &s;ide of him four beautiful children, clothed in linen robes and crowned with flowers, carried with re&s;pectful awe, the holy water, the incen&s;e and the fire: proud of this employment, which was the reward of a year's good behaviour, they advanced more gravely than the old people.</P>
<P>To arrive at the valley of tombs, it was nece&s;&s;ary to go near a league upon the banks of the Tagus, and under a green canopy formed by a double row of poplars. The &s;hepherds marched in &s;ilence through fields, upon the verdant turf, thick &s;own with flowers which were &s;till moi&s;t with dew. The &s;un began to gild the tops of the mountains, and announced one of the fine&s;t days of &s;ummer, all the expan&s;e of heaven was a deep azure, a &s;oft breeze gently agitated the leaves, and lulled the little birds in their ne&s;ts; the lark, already lo&s;t in the air, made him&s;elf be heard though he could not be perceived; the nightingale, fatigued with having warbled through the night, reanimated him&s;elf to hail the return of day; the turtle and her mate joined their re&s;pon&s;ive plaints to the melody of the linnet's voice; the flowers exhaled their &s;weets; the fi&s;hes &s;ported upon the &s;mooth waters of the river; all nature at the moment of its revival, &s;eemed to thank
<PB N="73" REF="033741_0107_0FF8C1FCEC1FA780">
the bountiful Creator for the new benefits which he be&s;towed.</P>
<P>Timbrio, Blanche and Ni&s;ida, little accu&s;tomed to this &s;pectacle, contemplated it with &s;urpri&s;e; the entering into the valley of tombs filled them with fre&s;h admiration.</P>
<P>Upon the bank of that beautiful river, who&s;e waters roll over golden &s;ands, is a &s;pace of a mile &s;quare, girt on all &s;ides by a chain of hills, but one pa&s;&s;age leads into it through a long defile, the &s;ides of which are lined with rows of cypre&s;s that ri&s;e above each other like an amphitheatre, and &s;o clo&s;ely locked together, that their interlacing branches form a thick wall and high as the tops of the hills; ro&s;es and wild <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mine relieved with their red and yellow flowers, the dark green of tho&s;e walls; no flocks had ever penetrated into this a&s;ylum; the wood-cutter never carried the axe into the&s;e &s;acred groves. A profound &s;ilence reigned every where, one only heard the gen|tle falling of ca&s;cades, which de&s;cending under the thick fol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">age, united together in a bed of mo&s;s, and rolled their little &s;ilver floods into the Tagus.</P>
<P>At the extremity of this avenue is an antique fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|tree, which &s;eems to &s;hut up the valley, upon its bark are engraven the&s;e words:&mdash;</P>

<L>If vice corrupts thee tremble here to tread;</L>
<L>The good alone may boldly enter here,</L>

<P>In the interior of the valley the cypre&s;s reigned all around, in the mid&s;t a fountain of water, ever

moi&s;tened and refre&s;hed the green turf; the tombs are &s;cattered here and there, &s;ome are already covered with ivy, others &s;till ornamented with garlands; but each of them enclo&s;ed what was mortal of a being that loved virtue.</P>
<P>The honour of being interred in this valley was not granted to all the dead; it was the recompence of an irreproachable life. The village, in a&s;&s;embly adjudged it; alas! the tombs were but few!</P>
<P>The &s;hepherds being arrived at the fountain, &s;top|ped there; and Salvadore rai&s;ing his voice, &s;eparate your&s;elves &s;aid he, you will a&s;&s;emble near me, when the trumpet &s;ounds again. At the&s;e words every one di&s;per&s;es; each widow, each orphan, ran to the &s;tone that covered the object of their tears.</P>
<P>Timbrio, Fabian and the two &s;i&s;ters lo&s;t &s;ight of Elicio, they looked around the valley for him; they &s;oon di&s;covered him on his knees before the tomb of his mother, his hands were joined together, and his eyes, full of tears rai&s;ed up to heaven&mdash;Oh! my mother, &s;aid he, you are &s;urely happy, &s;ince you were always good; look down upon me from your dwell|ing above, watch over me, and &s;o in&s;pire my heart that I may love virtue as well as I have loved you. In pronouncing the&s;e words, he pre&s;&s;ed his face upon the tomb, while his tears ran along upon the &s;tone.</P>
<P>The four lovers li&s;tened to him in &s;ilence, they approached him, and Timbrio taking the hand of the &s;hepherd, worthy &s;on, &s;aid he to him, you fill my heart with tenderne&s;s and re&s;pect; promi&s;e to be my friend, and from this moment, I will renounce the world, become a &s;hepherd, with Ni&s;ida, Blanche,

and Fabian; &mdash;in your neighbourhood I will purcha&s;e a cottage and live contented. You would be too near an unfortunate, &s;aid Elicio; from the time that I lo&s;t my mother, one &s;entiment alone remained in my heart to make life d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ble, that &s;entiment was love; and to-morrow I lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e the object of it forever.

<P>He was &s;till &s;peaking when the trumpet &s;ounded. Explain to us &s;aid Timbrio, why Salvadore now recalls us;&mdash;to honour, replied Elicio, the a&s;hes of the la&s;t &s;hepherd whom we have lo&s;t,&mdash;we &s;hall immediately hear the hi&s;tory of his life, which will be &s;ung to us by the mo&s;t di&s;creet of our &s;hep|herde&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Everyone was now a&s;&s;embled at the fountain; their venerable conductor guided them to a tomb, the &s;tone was &s;till white, and this &s;imple in&s;cription on it: HERE RESTS A GOOD SON.</P>

<P>My friends, &s;aid Salvadore, your own hearts &s;peak better to you than it is po&s;&s;ible for me to do, you are all moved to tears at the relation of a virtuous action; think then, what mu&s;t be the delight of doing one. After the&s;e few words, the venerable pa&s;tor led the &s;hepherds out of the valley; he broke the order of their march, and all di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves among the beautiful meadows that were watered by the Ta|gus.</P>
<P>The two friends, and the two &s;i&s;ters, who had not forgotten the promi&s;e of Elicio, took the road to the fountain of Ardoi&s;es. The unhappy &s;hepherd recount|ed to them his love, and the deep de&s;pair that he felt at the thoughts of Galatea's marriage. Fabian, Blanche and Ni&s;ida endeavoured to con&s;ole him, while Timbrio was devi&s;ing by what means he might have him united to his mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Behind the&s;e at a little di&s;tance, Galatea, Flori&s;e,
<PB N="79" REF="033741_0113_0FF8FB306747C940">
Teolinda, Tircis and Damon walked together with|out &s;peaking. The daughter of Meoris reflected that the very next day was to be the day of her departure. Flori&s;e was forming the project of following her into Portugal; while the &s;ad Teolinda envied the condi|tion of tho&s;e who &s;lept in the valley of tombs.</P>
<P>To reach the fountain of Ardoi&s;es, it was nece&s;&s;a|ry to quit the banks of the Tagus and cro&s;s &s;ome hills covered with wood. The dog of Elicio, who was not that day permitted to follow Galatea, remained in the village; he &s;aw &s;ome of the &s;hepherds coming home; but not perceiving either his ma&s;ter or his mi&s;tre&s;s he ran to &s;eek them, and joined them ju&s;t as they entered the wood.</P>
<P>After having fri&s;ked from one party to another, al|ternately care&s;&s;ing Elicio and Galatea, he ran about the mountain and &s;tarted a wild kid, which he clo&s;e|ly pur&s;ued; the kid fled and pa&s;&s;ed near to the &s;hep|herde&s;&s;es. Fear gave him &s;trength, he gained, with|out being &s;topped, a cavern, which he entered bleat|ing, the dog followed him; Galatea cried out for &s;ome one to &s;ave the little goat; every one ran, they arrive at the mouth of the cave, and Elicio in a mo|ment, darts into it after the dog.</P>
<P>Tircis, Damon and the two friends, laughing, en|deavoured, to quiet the fears of the &s;hepherde&s;s, and waited at the mouth of the cave expecting to &s;ee the lover of Galatea appear with the young goat in his arms.&mdash;But &s;uddenly a frightful noi&s;e a&s;&s;ailed their ears from the bottom of the cavern; they &s;oon &s;aw Elicio come forth, &s;truggling with a man who&s;e a&s;pect was terrifying; he was covered with tattered rags, a

black and thick beard hid half of his face, his long hair floated in di&s;order on his &s;houlders, his arms naked and nervous, were employed in an endeavour to &s;trangle Elicio; the &s;hepherd, not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;s vigorous, held his left hand again&s;t the hairy brea&s;t of the wild man, his right hand fa&s;tened in his hair, pulled back the head of his enemy; they were &s;ilent, their eyes darting fire at each other, their limbs were twi&s;ted to|gether; while each with all his force, endeavoured to throw his adver&s;ary to the ground.</P>
<P>The dog of Elicio had not quit his ma&s;ter, and would have made efforts to &s;uccour him, but a wild goat gave him enough to do to defend him&s;elf; atten|tive that he &s;hould not get to her &s;ide, &s;he pu&s;hed him before her, &s;till menacing him with her horns, whil&s;t the young kid now lo&s;ing all fear, jumped round its mother, and &s;eemed to brave him that he &s;o lately dreaded.</P>
<P>Tircis, Damon and the two friends, flew to &s;eparate the combatants, and Timbrio &s;eizing the &s;avage, had need of all his force to hold him&mdash;but Teolinda faints, and every one ran to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance; the wild man throws his eyes upon her, he remains immoveable, gazing intently upon the pale face of the &s;hepherde&s;s. Suddenly &s;tarting from the arms of Timbrio, he caught up the young goat, the innocent cau&s;e of &s;o many accidents, he fell on his knees to Teolinda, and pre&s;ented it to her with a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive air; &s;carcely had the &s;hepherde&s;s come to her&s;elf, when &s;he fell on the neck of the wild man. Ah! is it you, cried &s;he, Ar|tidore, my dear Artidore, you have not then forgotten your poor Teolinda. At the name of Teolinda, Ar|tidore

changed colour, he &s;prings up, and looking wildly on the &s;hepherde&s;s, Teolinda! &s;aid he, &s;he has deceived me;&mdash;I remember her well; Is &s;he here? &mdash;Yes, replied Teolinda, with a trembling voice, &s;he is here, &s;he only lives for you! Li&s;ten, &s;aid Arti|dore, &s;peaking to her in a low voice, you mu&s;t bring me to her, I wi&s;h to reproach her with her perfidy, I wi&s;h to tell her that I no longer love her. Afterwards we will return and dwell in my cave, you &s;hall be my friend, and I will give you my little goat.</P>
<P>Teolinda &s;aw by his di&s;cour&s;e, that grief had un&s;et|tled the rea&s;on of the unfortunate Artidore. She looked on him with earne&s;tne&s;s, while the tears ran down her eyes, and pre&s;&s;ing his hand with tenderne&s;s, I de&s;ire nothing more, &s;aid &s;he, I will never quit you again, I will remain with you to the la&s;t hour of my life, I hope to prove to you that Teolinda was not to blame. In &s;aying the&s;e words, &s;he took the arm of Artidore, and led him with her into the road that con|ducted them to the fountain of Ardoi&s;es, the goat and her young one followed them, while the re&s;t of the &s;hepherds kept a few paces behind, impatient to &s;ee the end of this adventure.</P>
<P>As they went along, Teolinda u&s;ed every effort to recall him to a recollection which &s;he at once <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ared and wi&s;hed; attentive to &s;ay nothing that might be di&s;plea&s;ing to her lover, &s;he &s;poke with precaution of her&s;elf, brought with tenderne&s;s their loves to his memory, recounted the hi&s;tory of her twin &s;i&s;ter, and all the tears &s;he had co&s;t her. She ob&s;erved the effects of each word upon the counte|nance of Artidore, followed &s;tep by &s;tep the progre&s;s
<PB N="82" REF="033741_0116_0FF8C1FFAB9D92B8">
that &s;he made on his rea&s;on, and &s;trained every facul|ty of her &s;oul to bring back the affections of her lever. Artidore li&s;tens to her like a man come out of a long &s;leep; he replies properly to &s;ome que&s;tions, makes her repeat others; by little and little, his memory and his ideas come to him; Love bereft him of rea&s;on, Love ought to give it back to him again; he &s;tops, he con&s;iders Teolinda, recollects her, falls at her feet, holds her in his arms, and his tears proved to the &s;hepherde&s;s, that her lover was no longer in&s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>They arrived at the fountain, where every one joined them; Flori&s;e and Galatea had related as they went along, all that they knew of the loves of Arti|dore and Teolinda. After having felicitated the &s;hepherde&s;s, they begged of her to prevail on her lover to begin a recital of his adventures from the moment that the twin &s;i&s;ter had &s;o cruelly deceived him. Ar|tidore con&s;ented, and though a little a&s;hamed of the &s;ituation in which he found him&s;elf, he continued thus his hi&s;tory:&mdash;</P>
<P>"The di&s;cour&s;e of the fal&s;e Teolinda threw me in|to the mo&s;t dreadful de&s;pair, I re&s;olved to fly for ever from her whom I believed &s;o perfidious; I was will|ing, however, to let her know that I &s;till loved her&punc; and I engraved my eternal farewell upon the bark of a poplar; I do not even remember what I wrote. From that time my rea&s;on grew weak and abandoned me; I wandered without end in the fields, and I was four days without taking any nouri&s;hment; this ab&s;ti|nence compl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ted my di&s;order; I can but confu&s;edly recal what happened to me; two circum&s;tances alone are engraven on my memory.</P>

<P>"The ob&s;curity and the total retirement of that habitation, made me chu&s;e it for my tomb.

In &s;pight of my&s;elf I was affected, I ri&s;e up, I run to where the noi&s;e came from, and I perceived the little goat that I had &s;aved, he had pa&s;&s;ed his white no&s;e between the &s;tone and the rock, and &s;eemed to demand of me to open it to him.</P>

<P>"I examined where &s;he bled, I knew the marks of the wolf's teeth, I went to &s;eek &s;ome water, I wa&s;hed the wounds, &s;taunched the blood, and I tied them up with a part of my clothes; after this operation, the goat &s;eemed to regard me with tenderne&s;s, &s;he lay &s;oftly down, &s;howed her paps full of milk, and &s;eem|ed to invite me to partake the nouri&s;hment of her little one, whom I re&s;tored to her.</P>

a re&s;traint; and &s;eigning to be obliged to return to her hou&s;e, &s;he toook leave of Blanche, Ni&s;ida and Teolinda, and took the road to the village, accompa|nied by no one but her dear Flori&s;e.</P>
<P>They had gone but a little way, when four men &s;tarted from behind a hedge, &s;ei&s;ed the two &s;hepherd|e&s;&s;es, prevented them with their handkerchiefs, from crying out, and forced them upon two mules that they had there, ready prepared for the purpo&s;e; Galatea and Flori&s;e obeyed them trembling, the four men mounted on hor&s;eback, placed the mules in the centre, and &s;et off in a full gallop towards the fron|tiers of Ca&s;tile.</P>
<P>The ravi&s;hers were the four Portugue&s;e, who had for &s;ome days been at the hou&s;e of Meoris; they &s;aw how coldly they were received by all the village, they remembered the manner that Elicio had looked at them, after &s;upper, and the tenderne&s;s with which he viewed Galatea, had made them &s;u&s;pect the truth; the delay that Meoris had made to go to the valley of tombs, the refu&s;al of the inhabitants to let them ac|company them to that valley, &s;eemed to them to be a pretext and an in&s;ult; they feared be&s;ides, to return without Galatea, and they conceived that the carry|ing her off, would be pardoned when the daughter of Meoris was married to their ma&s;ter; every thing as yet had &s;ucceeded to their wi&s;hes, they fled with their prey&mdash;but Love watched over Galatea.</P>
<P>Artidore having changed his clothes in the cottage of Elicio, was returning with him to the fountain, they &s;aw at a di&s;tance, the four cavaliers, and knew the &s;hepherde&s;&s;es; Elicio gave a great cry and flew to

his mi&s;tre&s;s, with both his hands he &s;topped the mules. One of the Portugue&s;e rai&s;ed his arm to pierce Elicio with a lance; at the &s;ame in&s;tant Artidore ran to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and with the &s;troke of a &s;tick he broke the arm of the barbarian;&mdash;the two &s;hepherde&s;&s;es &s;ei&s;ed the moment of confu&s;ion, &s;lipped from their mules, and being well acquainted with the place, ran with all their &s;peed to look for &s;uccour at the fountain. In the mean time Elicio had &s;ei&s;ed upon the lance of the wounded man, and &s;tanding clo&s;e to Artidore, the&s;e two brave &s;hepherds on foot, and armed only with a lance and a &s;tick, made head again&s;t the three treach|erous cavaliers, who wi&s;hed to avenge their compan|ion.</P>
<P>This unequal combat was long continued, but cou|rage was yielding to force. Elicio, wounded in the arm, could no longer defend him&s;elf&mdash;when Timbrio, &s;word in hand, fell like thunder upon the Portugue&s;e, at the fir&s;t &s;troke, he made the head fly from the &s;houlders of him that pre&s;&s;ed harde&s;t on Elicio. Tir|cis, Damon and Fabian were now arrived, when the two remaining Portugue&s;e, putting &s;purs to their hor&s;es, fled with the utmo&s;t &s;peed.</P>
<P>The wounds of Elicio were not dangerous, but he lo&s;t much blood; Galatea is terrified, &s;he &s;tops it with her handkerchief, &s;he dre&s;&s;ed the wound her&s;elf,&mdash; this alone, would have been &s;ufficient to have cured Elicio; they led him to the village, his arm in a &s;carf, Galatea &s;upporting him, and this favour more than paid him for the danger he ran in &s;uccouring her.</P>

You may believe this avowal, when it comes from the mouth of his rival; you required that your &s;on-in-law &s;hould be rich, behold this flock, which is in it&s;elf a fortune, it is Elicio's, it is not I who have be&s;towed it; I have done no more than go among the neighbouring ham|lets, Elicio has &s;o many friends, that each of them gave him a lamb and its mother; and in two days I have formed this flock.</P>

<P>Every one admired the genero&s;ity of Timbrio; Artidore and Teolinda held him in a long and &s;ilent embrace. Meoris was willing that the contracts &s;hould be all &s;ettled that evening; he ran to &s;pread in the village the news of &s;o many happy events, and brought back with him the notary and the venerable Salvadore.</P>
<P>The contracts were &s;oon fini&s;hed, and it was agreed that Timbrio, the very next day, &s;hould &s;end back all his &s;uite to Toledo; with a confidential &s;er|vant, who &s;hould carry the news to the relations of Ni&s;ida, and bring back in ready money, the fortune of his ma&s;ter. In the mean time, Meoris was to pur|cha&s;e the flocks and farms for the new &s;hepherds: and till all was got ready, Timbrio and Fabian, with their wives, were to remain at the hou&s;e of Meoris; and Teolinda and Artidore at that of Era&s;tres.</P>
<P>Nothing was now wanting but to fix the day of their four marriages; Elicio, notwith&s;tanding his wounds, was decided that it &s;hould be the next day, nor could the wi&s;e Salvadore prevail on him to defer it. The re&s;t, without &s;aying any thing, were of opinion with Elicio.</P>

<HEAD>AMELIA: OR THE FAITHLESS BRITON.</HEAD>
<P>THE revolutions of government, and the &s;ubver&s;ions of empire, which have &s;welled the theme of national hi&s;torians, have like|wi&s;e, in every age, furni&s;hed anecdote to the biographer, and incident to the noveli&s;t. The objects of policy or ambition are gene|rally, indeed, accompli&s;hed at the expence of private ea&s;e and pro&s;perity; while the triumph of arms, like the funeral fe&s;tivity of a &s;avage tribe, &s;erves to announce &s;ome recent calamity&mdash;the wa&s;te of property, or the fall of families.</P>
<P>Thus, the great events of the late war, which produced the &s;eparation of the Briti&s;h empire, and e&s;tabli&s;hed the &s;overeignty of America, were chequered with &s;cenes of pri|vate &s;orrow, and the &s;ucce&s;s of the contend|ing forces was alternately fatal to the peace and order of dome&s;tic life. The lamentati|ons of the widow and the orphan, mingled
<PB N="2" REF="033741_0133_0FF8FB611EB10288">
with the &s;ong of victory; and the &s;able man|tle with which the hand of friend&s;hip cloathed the bier of the gallant MONTGOMERY, ca&s;t a momentary gloom upon the trophies his valour had atchieved.</P>
<P>Though the following tale then, does not exhibit the terrible magnificence of warlike operations, or &s;crutinize the principles of national politics, it recites an epi&s;ode that too frequently occurs in the military drama, and contains a hi&s;tory of female affliction, that claims, from its authenticity, at lea&s;t, an in|tere&s;t in the feeling heart. It is the fir&s;t of a &s;eries of novels, drawn from the &s;ame &s;ource, and intended for public communication, but as the author's object is merely to glean tho&s;e circum&s;tances in the progre&s;s of the revolution, which the hi&s;torian has neither lei&s;ure nor di&s;po&s;ition to commemo|rate, and to produce, from the annals of pri|vate life, &s;omething to entertain, and &s;ome|thing to improve his readers, the occa&s;ion will yield little to hope from the applau&s;e of the public, and nothing to dread from its candor.</P>
<P>HORATIO BLYFIELD was a re&s;pectable in|habitant of the &s;tate of New-York. Suc|ce&s;s had rewarded his indu&s;try in trade with
<PB N="3" REF="033741_0134_0FF8FB65A768E9B8">
an ample fortune; and his mind, unconta|minated by envy and ambition, freely indulg|ed it&s;elf in the delicious enjoyments of the father and the friend. In the former character he &s;uperintended the education of a &s;on and a daughter, left to his &s;ole care by the death of their excellent mother; and in the latter, his benevolence and council were uniformly exerci&s;ed for the relief of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and the information of the illiterate.</P>
<P>His mercantile intercour&s;e with Great Britain afforded an early opportunity of ob|&s;erving the di&s;po&s;ition of that kingdom with re&s;pect to her colonies; and his knowledge of the habits, tempers, and opinions of the American citizens, furni&s;hed him with a painful anticipation of anarchy and war. The texture of his mind, indeed, was natu|rally calm and pa&s;&s;ive, and the ordinary ef|fects of a life of &s;ixty years duration, had to|tally eradicated all tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which rou&s;e men to oppo&s;ition, and qualify them for enterprize. When, therefore, the gauntlet was thrown upon the theatre of the new world, and the &s;pirit of di&s;cord began to rage, Horatio, like the Roman Atticus, withdrew from public clamour, to a &s;eque&s;|tered cottage, in the interior di&s;trict of Long-I&s;land; and con&s;ecrating the youthful
<PB N="4" REF="033741_0135_0FF8C207A17F8BD8">
ardour of his &s;on, Honorius, to the &s;ervice of his country, the fair Amelia was the only companion of his retreat.</P>
<P>Amelia had then attained her &s;eventeenth year. The delicacy of her form was in uni&s;on with the mildne&s;s of her a&s;pect, and the ex|qui&s;ite harmony of her &s;oul, was re&s;pon|&s;ive to the &s;ymmetry of her per&s;on. The pride of parental attachment had graced her with every accompli&s;hment that depends upon tuition; and it was the &s;ingular fortune of Amelia, to be at once the admiration of our &s;ex, and the favourite of her own. From &s;uch a daughter, Horatio could not but re|ceive every &s;olace of which his generous feel|ings were &s;u&s;ceptible in a &s;ea&s;on of national calamity; but the din of arms that frequent|ly interrupted the &s;ilence of the neighbour|ing fore&s;ts, and the di&s;a&s;trous intelligence which his &s;on occa&s;ionally tran&s;mitted from the &s;tandard of the union, &s;uperceded the cheerful avocations of the day, and di&s;pelled the peaceful &s;lumbers of the night.</P>
<P>After a retirement of many months, on a morning fatal to the happine&s;s of Horatio's family, the &s;ound of artillery announced a battle, and the hor&s;emen who were ob&s;erved gallopping acro&s;s the grounds, proved that the &s;cene of action could not be remote. As &s;oon, therefore, as the tumult of ho&s;tility
<PB N="5" REF="033741_0136_0FF8FB68219AEF90">
had &s;ub&s;ided, Horatio advanced with his dome&s;tics, to admini&s;ter comfort and a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance to the wounded, and to provide a de|cent interment for the mangled victims of the conflict. In traver&s;ing the deadly field, he perceived an officer, who&s;e exhau&s;ted &s;trength ju&s;t &s;erved for the articulation of a groan, and his attention was immediately directed to the pre&s;ervation of this intere&s;t|ing object, who alone, of the number that had fallen, yielded a hope that his compa&s;|&s;ionate exertions might be crowned with &s;uc|ce&s;s. Having bathed, and bound up his wounds, the youthful &s;oldier was borne to the cottage; where, in a &s;hort time, a &s;tronger pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e, and a freer re&s;piration, afforded a flattering pre&s;age of returning life.</P>
<P>Amelia, who had anxiou&s;ly waited the arrival of her father, beheld, with a mixed &s;en&s;ation of horror and pity, the &s;pectacle which now accompanied him. She had ne|ver before &s;een the &s;emblance of death, which therefore afflicted her with all the terrors of imagination; and, notwith&s;tanding the pallid countenance of the wounded gue&s;t, he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed an elegance of per&s;on, which, accord|ing to the natural operations of female &s;en|&s;ibility, added &s;omething perhaps, to her commi&s;eration for his misfortunes. When,
<PB N="6" REF="033741_0137_0FF8FB6AA26ACA80">
however, the&s;e fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions had pa&s;&s;ed away, the tenderne&s;s of her nature expre&s;&s;ed it&s;elf in the mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous actions for his ea&s;e and accommodation, and the increa&s;ing &s;ymptoms of his recovery, filled her mind with joy and exultation.</P>
<P>The day &s;ucceeding that on which he was introduced to the family of Horatio, his &s;er|vant, who had made an ineffectual &s;earch for his body among the &s;lain, arrived at the cottage, and di&s;covered him to be <HI>Doli&s;cus,</HI> the only &s;on and heir of a noble family in England.</P>
<P>When Doli&s;cus had recovered from the &s;en&s;ele&s;s &s;tate to which he had been reduced (chiefly, indeed, by the great effu&s;ion of blood) the fir&s;t exerci&s;e of his faculties was the acknowledgment of obligation, and the profe&s;&s;ion of gratitude. To Horatio he &s;poke in terms of reverence and re&s;pect; and to Amelia in the more animated language of admiration, which melted at length into the gentle tone of flattery and love. But Doli&s;|cus had been reared in the &s;chool of di&s;&s;ipa|tion! and, with all the qualifications which allure and captivate the female heart, he had learned to con&s;ider virtue only as an ob&s;tacle to plea&s;ure, and beauty merely as an incen|tive to the gratification of pa&s;&s;ion. His ex|perience
<PB N="7" REF="033741_0138_0FF8FB6C40E8B638">
&s;oon enabled him to di&s;cover &s;ome|thing in the &s;olicitude of the artle&s;s Amelia beyond the dictates of compa&s;&s;ion and ho&s;|pitality; and even before his wounds were clo&s;ed, he conceived the infamous project of violating the purity and tranquility of a family, to which he was indebted for the prolongation of his exi&s;tence, and the re&s;|toration of his health. From that very in|nocence, however, which betrayed her feel|ings, while &s;he was her&s;elf ignorant of their &s;ource, he anticipated the extreme&s;t difficulty and danger. To improve the evident predi|lection of her mind into a fixed and ardent attachment, required not, indeed, a very &s;trenuous di&s;play of his talents and addre&s;s; but the &s;acrifice of her honour (which an in|&s;urmountable antipathy to the matrimonial engagements made nece&s;&s;ary to the accom|pli&s;hment of his purpo&s;e) was a ta&s;k that he ju&s;tly fore&s;aw, could be only executed by the dete&s;table agency of perfidy and fraud. With the&s;e views then he readily accepted the &s;olicitations of his un&s;u&s;pecting ho&s;t, and even contrived to protract his cure, in order to furni&s;h a plea for his continuance at the cottage.</P>
<P>Amelia, when, at length, the apprehen|&s;ions for his &s;afety were removed, employed
<PB N="8" REF="033741_0139_0FF8FB6F2F079CA0">
all the charms of mu&s;ic and conver&s;ation to di&s;&s;ipate the languor, which his indi&s;po&s;ition had produced, and to prevent the melan|choly, with which retirement is apt to affect a di&s;po&s;ition accu&s;tomed to the gay and bu&s;y tran&s;actions of the world. She experienced an unu&s;ual plea&s;ure, indeed, in the di&s;charge of the&s;e benevolent offices; for in the com|pany of Doli&s;cus &s;he in&s;en&s;ibly forgot the anxiety &s;he was wont to feel for the fate of her ab&s;ent brother; and the &s;ympathy which &s;he had hitherto extended to all the &s;ufferers of the war, was now monopolized by a &s;ingle object. Horatio's attachment to the &s;olitude of his library, afforded frequent opportuni|ties for this infatuating intercour&s;e, which the de&s;igning Doli&s;cus gradually diverted from general to particular topics&mdash;from ob|&s;ervations upon public manners and events, to in&s;inuations of per&s;onal e&s;teem and partiality. Amelia was incapable of deceit, and unac|quainted with &s;u&s;picion. The energy, but, at the &s;ame time, the re&s;pect, with which Doli&s;cus addre&s;&s;ed her, was grateful to her feelings; his rank and fortune entitled him to con&s;ideration, and the ine&s;timable favours that had been conferred upon him, offered a &s;pecious &s;ecurity for his truth and fidelity. The acknowledgment of reciprocal regard
<PB N="9" REF="033741_0140_0FF8FB731806BDD8">
was, therefore, an ea&s;y acqui&s;ition, and Do|li&s;cus triumphed in the mode&s;t, but expli|cit avowal, before Amelia was apprized of its importance and extent. From that mo|ment, however, he a&s;&s;umed a pen&s;ive and dejected carriage. He occa&s;ionally affected to &s;tart from the terrors of a deep reverie&punc; and the vivacity of his temper, which had never yielded to the angui&s;h of his wounds, &s;eemed &s;uddenly to have expired under the weight of &s;ecret and intolerable affliction. Amelia, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and a&s;toni&s;hed, implored an explanation of &s;o my&s;terious a change in his deportment; but his reiterated &s;ighs, which were for a while, the only an&s;wers &s;he received, tended equally to encrea&s;e her curio&s;ity and her &s;orrow.</P>
<P>At length he undertook to di&s;clo&s;e the &s;ource of his pretended wretchedne&s;s; and, having prefaced the hypocritical tale with the mo&s;t &s;olemn prote&s;tions of his love and con&s;tancy, he told the trembling Amelia that, were it even po&s;&s;ible to di&s;engage him|&s;elf from an alliance which had been early contracted for him with a noble heire&s;s of London, &s;till the pride of family, and the &s;pirit of loyalty, which governed his father's actions, would oppo&s;e a union unaccompa|nied by the acclamations of dignity, and formed with one who&s;e connections were
<PB N="10" REF="033741_0141_0FF8FB755FB19238">
zealous in the arduous re&s;i&s;tence to the au|thority of Britain. "While he lives," added Doli&s;cus, " it is not in my power to choo&s;e the means of happine&s;s&mdash;and yet, as the time approaches when it will be incon&s;i&s;tent with the duty and honour of a &s;oldier to enjoy any longer the &s;ociety of Amelia, how can I reflect upon my &s;ituation without angui&s;h and de&s;|pair!" The delicate frame of Amelia was agitat|ed with the &s;en&s;ations which this picture had excited; and, for the fir&s;t time, &s;he became acquainted with the force of love, and the dread of &s;eparation from its object. Do|li&s;cus traced the &s;entiments of her heart in the &s;ilent, but certain indications of her countenance, and when tears had melted the violence of her fir&s;t emotion into a &s;oft and &s;ympathetic grief, the treacherous &s;uitor thus pro&s;ecuted his &s;cheme again&s;t her peace and innocence.</P>
<P>"But it is impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;olve upon per|petual mi&s;ery! One thing may yet be done to change the &s;cene without incurring a fa|ther's re&s;entment and reproach:&mdash;can my Amelia con&s;ent to &s;acrifice a &s;entiment of delicacy, to en&s;ure a life of happine&s;s?" Her complexion brightened and her eye in|qui&s;itively turned towards him. " The pa|rade of public marriage" he continued,
<PB N="11" REF="033741_0142_0FF8FB7847CE3EC8">
"neither adds &s;trength or energy to the ob|ligation: for, form is the &s;uperfluous off|&s;pring of fa&s;hion, not the re&s;ult of rea&s;on. The poor pea&s;ant who&s;e nuptial contract is only witne&s;&s;ed by the hallowed mini&s;ter that pronounces it, is as ble&s;t as the prince who weds in all the o&s;tentation of a court, and furni&s;hes an additional fe&s;tival to a giddy nation. My Amelia has &s;urely no vanity to gratify with idle pageantry; and as the pri|vacy of the marriage does not take from its &s;anctity, I will venture to propo&s;e&mdash;nay, look not with &s;everity&mdash;at the neighbouring farm we may be met by the chaplain of my regiment, and love and honour &s;hall record a union, which prudence fetters with a tempo|rary &s;ecrecy."</P>
<P>Hope, fear, the &s;en&s;e of decorum, and the incitements of a pa&s;&s;ion pure, but fervent, compleated the painful perturbation of Ame|lia's heart, and, in this critical moment of her fate, deprived her of &s;peech and recol|lection.</P>
<P>An anxious interval of &s;ilence took place; but when, at length, the power of expre&s;&s;ion returned, Amelia urged the duty which &s;he owed to a parent, the &s;candal which the world imputed to clande&s;tine marriages, and the fatal con&s;equences that might ari&s;e from
<PB N="12" REF="033741_0143_0FF8FB7A8AADB038">
the ob&s;curity of the tran&s;action. But Doli&s;|cus, &s;teady to his purpo&s;e, again deprecated the folly of pur&s;uing the &s;hadow in prefer|ence to the &s;ub&s;tance, of pre&s;erving fame at the expence of happine&s;s, and of relinqui&s;h|ing the ble&s;&s;ings of connubial life, for the &s;ake of its formalities. He &s;poke of Hora|tio's inflexible integrity, which could not brook even the appearance of deception, and of his punctilious honour, which could not &s;ubmit even to the appearance of intru&s;ion upon the dome&s;tic arrangements of another, as in&s;urmountable arguments for denying him the knowledge of their union. Finally, he de&s;cribed, in the warme&s;t colouring of pa&s;&s;ion and fancy, the effects of Amelia's re|fu&s;al upon the future tenor of his life, and bathing her hand with his obedient tears, practi&s;ed all the arts of flattery and frenzy. The influence of love &s;upercedes every other obligation: Amelia acknowledged its do|minion, and yielded to the per&s;ua&s;ion of the exulting Doli&s;cus. The marriage ceremony was privately repeated&mdash;but how will it excite the indignation of the virtuous read|er when he under&s;tands, that the &s;acred character of the prie&s;t was per&s;onated by a &s;oldier whom Doli&s;cus had &s;uborned for this iniquitous occa&s;ion! Ye &s;pirits of &s;eduction!

who&s;e means are the pro&s;titution of faith, and who&s;e end is the de&s;truction of inno|cence, &mdash;tremble at impending judgment, for "there is no mercy in heaven for &s;uch unheard of crimes as the&s;e!"</P>
<P>But a &s;hort time had elap&s;ed after this fa|tal &s;tep, when the mandate of the command|ing officer obliged Doli&s;cus to prepare for joining his corps. A &s;ilent, but pungent &s;en&s;e of indi&s;cretion, added to the angui&s;h which Amelia felt in the hour of &s;eparation; and not all his &s;trong a&s;&s;urances of inviolable truth and attachment, with the &s;oothing pro&s;pect of an honourable avowal of their union, could efface the melancholy impre&s;&s;i|ons of her mind The farmer at who&s;e hou&s;e the fictitious marriage had been rehear&s;|ed, was employed to manage their future corre&s;pondence; and Doli&s;cus, finally, left the cottage with vows of love and gratitude at his lips; but &s;chemes of fraud and per|jury in his heart. The &s;mall di&s;tance from New-York, where he was quartered, ren|dered it ea&s;y to maintain an epi&s;tolary inter|cour&s;e; which became, during its continu|ance, the only employment, and the only gratification of Amelia's exi&s;tence. Its con|tinuance, however, exceeded not a few weeks. Doli&s;cus &s;oon a&s;&s;umed a formal and

di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate &s;tyle, and the number of his letters gradually dimini&s;hed, and every allu|&s;ion to that marriage, which was the la&s;t hope and con&s;olation of Amelia, he cautiou&s;|ly avoided.</P>
<P>But an event, that demanded the exerci&s;e of all her fortitude, now forced it&s;elf upon Amelia's thoughts. She was pregnant; yet could neither re&s;ort for council and comfort to the father whom &s;he had deceived, or ob|tain it from the lover by whom &s;he had been &s;educed. In the tendere&s;t and mo&s;t delicate terms &s;he communicated her &s;ituation to Doli&s;cus, emphatically called upon him to re&s;cue her reputation from obloquy, and &s;olicitou&s;ly courted his return to the cottage, or, at lea&s;t, that he would di&s;clo&s;e to Hora|tio the &s;ecret of their union. To prevent any accident, the farmer was prevailed upon to be the bearer of the paper which contained the&s;e &s;entiments, and, on his return pro|duced the following epi&s;tle.</P>

<P>"Gracious God!" exclaimed Amelia, and fell &s;en&s;ele&s;s to the ground. For a while, a convul&s;ive motion &s;hook her frame, but gradually &s;ub&s;iding, the flame of life &s;eemed to be extinct, and all her terrors at an end. The poor farmer, petrified with horror and
<PB N="16" REF="033741_0147_0FF8FB83549C69B8">
amazement, &s;tood gazing on the &s;cene: but the exertions of his homely &s;pou&s;e, at length, re&s;tored Amelia to exi&s;tence and de&s;pair.</P>
<P>It has often been ob&s;erved, that de&s;pon|dency begets boldne&s;s and enterprize; and the female heart, which is &s;u&s;ceptible of the gentle&s;t &s;entiment, is, likewi&s;e, capable of the noble&s;t fortitude. Amelia perceived all the ba&s;ene&s;s of the de&s;ertion meditated by Doli&s;cus; &s;he fore&s;aw all its ruinous con&s;e|quences upon Horatio's peace, her own character, and the fate of the innocent be|ing which &s;he bore; and wiping the u&s;ele&s;s tears from her cheek, &s;he re&s;olved publicly to vindicate her honour, and a&s;&s;ert her rights. Animated then, with the important purpo&s;e, &s;upported by the pre&s;umption of her marriage, and hoping yet to find Doli&s;|cus in New-York, &s;he immediately repaired to that city&mdash;but alas! he was gone! This di&s;appointment, however, did not defeat, nor could any ob&s;tacle retard the pro&s;ecuti|on of her de&s;ign: a &s;hip that &s;ailed the &s;uc|ceeding day wa&s;ted her to Britain, friendle&s;s and forlorn.</P>
<P>Innumerable difficulties and inconvenien|ces were encountered by the inexperienced traveller, but they vani&s;hed before the object of her pur&s;uit; and even her entrance into
<PB N="17" REF="033741_0148_0FF8FB85DD801BD8">
London, that chaos of clamour and di&s;&s;ipa|tion, produced no other &s;en&s;ations than tho&s;e which naturally aro&s;e from her approach to the dwelling of Doli&s;cus.</P>
<P>Amelia recollected that Doli&s;cus had often de&s;cribed the family re&s;idence to be &s;ituated in Gro&s;venor-place; and the &s;tage, in which &s;he journeyed, &s;topping in the evening at a public hou&s;e in Picadilly, &s;he determined, without delay, to pay him her unexpected and unwelcome vi&s;it. The embarra&s;&s;ed and anxious manner with which &s;he inquired for his hou&s;e, expo&s;ed her to unju&s;t &s;urmi&s;e and &s;en&s;ele&s;s ribaldry; but her grief rendered her incapable of ob&s;ervation, and her purity was &s;uperior to in&s;ult.</P>
<P>Doli&s;cus had arrived about a fortnight earlier than Amelia. The title, influence, and fortune, which devolved upon him in con&s;equence of his father's death, had &s;welled his youthful vanity to exce&s;s, and &s;upplied him with a numerous retinue of flatterers and dependants. At the moment that he was li&s;tening in extacy to that &s;ervile crew, the victim of his arts, the deluded daughter of the man to whom he was indebted for the pre&s;ervation of his life, &s;tood trembling at his door. A gentle rap, after an awful pau&s;e of &s;ome minutes, procured her admi&s;&s;ion. Her memory recognized the features of the
<PB N="18" REF="033741_0149_0FF8FB88CB5CCC58">
&s;ervant that opened the door; but it was not the valet who had attended Doli&s;cus at the cottage &mdash; &s;he remembered not where or when &s;he had &s;een him.</P>
<P>After con&s;iderable &s;olicitation, the porter con&s;ented to call Doli&s;cus from his compa|ny, and conducted Amelia into an anti|chamber to wait his arrival. A roar of laughter &s;ucceeded the delivery of her me&s;|&s;age, and the word <HI>a&s;&s;ignation,</HI> which was repeated on all &s;ides, &s;eemed to renovate the wit and hilarity of the table. The gay and gallant ho&s;t, inflamed with champagne, was not di&s;plea&s;ed at the imputation; but ob&s;erved, that as a lady was in the ca&s;e, it was unnece&s;&s;ary to apologize for a &s;hort de|&s;ertion of his friends and wine.</P>
<P>At the &s;ight of that lady, however, Doli&s;|cus &s;tarted. Amelia's countenance was pale and haggard with fatigue and &s;orrow; her per&s;on was oppre&s;&s;ed with the burthen which &s;he now bore in its la&s;t &s;tage, and her eye, fixed &s;teadfa&s;tly upon him, as he entered the room, be&s;poke the complicated angui&s;h and indignation of her feelings. Her a&s;pect &s;o changed, and her appearance &s;o unexpected, added to the terrors of a guilty con&s;cience, for a moment, Doli&s;cus thought the vi&s;i|tation &s;upernatural. But Amelia's wrongs having in&s;pired her with courage, &s;he boldly
<PB N="19" REF="033741_0150_0FF8FB8B0E8E5D38">
reproached him with his ba&s;ene&s;s and per&s;idy, and demanded a public and unequivocal ac|knowledgment of their marriage. In vain he endeavoured to &s;ooth and divert her from her purpo&s;e, in vain to per&s;uade her to &s;ilence and delay,&mdash;his arts had lo&s;t their wonted influence, while the re&s;toration of her in|jured fame and honour ab&s;orbed every facul|ty of her mind.</P>
<P>At length he a&s;&s;umed a different tone, a more authoritative manner. "Madam," ex|claimed he, "I am not to be thus duped or controuled. I have a &s;en&s;e of pity, indeed, for your indi&s;cretion, but none for your pa&s;&s;ion: I would alleviate your afflictions, but I will not &s;ubmit to your frenzy." "Wretch!" retorted Amelia, "but that I owe &s;omething to a father's peace, I &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e to call thee hu&s;band."&mdash;"<HI>Hu&s;band</HI>" cried Doli&s;cus, with a &s;neer, "Hu&s;band! why truly, I remember a rural ma&s;querade, at which an hone&s;t &s;oldier, now my humble porter, played the par&s;on, and you the blu&s;hing bride&mdash;but, pr'ythee, do not talk of hu&s;band."&mdash;</P>
<P>This di&s;covery only was wanting for the con&s;ummation of Amelia's mi&s;ery. It was &s;udden and fatal as the lightning's bla&s;t&mdash;&s;he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">unk beneath the &s;troke. A deadly &s;tupor
<PB N="20" REF="033741_0151_0FF8FB8F982507C0">
&s;eized upon her &s;en&s;es, which was &s;ometimes interrupted with a boi&s;terous laugh, and &s;ometimes with a nervous ejaculation.</P>
<P>Doli&s;cus, unaffected by compa&s;&s;ion or re|mor&s;e, was &s;olicitous only to employ this opportunity for Amelia's removal, and hav|ing conveyed her into a coach, a &s;ervant was directed to procure lodgings for her, in &s;ome ob&s;cure quarter of the city. She &s;poke not a word during the tran&s;action, but gazing with apparent indifference upon the objects that &s;urrounded her, &s;he &s;ubmitted to be tran&s;ported whither &s;oever they plea&s;ed to conduct her. After winding through a dreary and dirty pa&s;&s;age in the neighbourhood of St. Giles's, the carriage &s;topped at a hovel which belonged to a relation of the &s;ervant that accompanied her, and, he having com|municated in a &s;hort whi&s;per the object of his vi&s;it, an old and decrepid beldame led Amelia into a damp and narrow room, who&s;e &s;cant and tattered furniture proved the wretchedne&s;s of its inhabitants.</P>
<P>A premature birth was the natural con&s;e|quence of the conflict which had raged in Amelia's mind. She had entered the apart|ment but a few moments, when the ap|proach of that event gave a turn to her pa&s;|&s;ions, and called her drooping faculties once more into action. Without comfort, with|out

a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in the hour of extreme di&s;|tre&s;s (&s;ave the officious &s;ervices of her anti|quated ho&s;t) &s;he was delivered of a &s;on; but the fond &s;en&s;ibility of the mother obtained an in&s;tantaneous &s;uperiority over every other con&s;ideration. Though, alas! this &s;olitary gratification too, continued not long;&mdash;her infant expired after a languid exi&s;tence of three days, &s;erving only to increa&s;e the bit|terne&s;s of Amelia's portion.</P>
<P>Amelia ca&s;t her eye towards heaven as the breath de&s;erted the body of her babe:&mdash;it was not a look of &s;upplication, for what had &s;he to hope, or what to dread?&mdash;neither did it indicate di&s;&s;atisfaction or reproach, for &s;he had early learned the duty of reverence and re&s;ignation&mdash;but it was an awful appeal to the throne of grace, for the vindication of the act by which &s;he had re&s;olved to termi|nate her woes. A phial of laudanum, left by a charitable apothecary, who had vi&s;ited her in her &s;ickne&s;s, pre&s;ented the means, and &s;he wanted not the fortitude to employ them. Deliberately, then, pouring the baneful draught into a gla&s;s, &s;he looked wi&s;tfully for a while upon the infant corp&s;e that lay extended on its bed, then bending on her knee, uttered, in a firm and &s;olemn voice the melancholy effu&s;ions of her &s;oul,
<PB N="22" REF="033741_0153_0FF8FB942068FB58">
&mdash;"Gracious Father! when thy ju&s;tice &s;hall pronounce upon the deed which ex|tricates me from the calamities of the world, let thy mercy contemplate the cau&s;e that urged me to the perpetration. I have been deluded into error; but am free from guilt: I have been &s;olicitous to pre&s;erve my inno|cence and honour; but am expo&s;ed to infa|my and &s;hame. The treachery of him to whom I entru&s;ted my fate, has reduced me to de&s;pair&mdash;the declining day of him from whom I received my being, has been cloud|ed with my indi&s;cretions, and there is no cure left for the &s;orrows that con&s;ume me, but the dark and &s;ilent grave. Vi&s;it me not then, in thy wrath, oh! Father, but let the exce&s;s of my &s;ufferings in this world, ex|piate the crime which wafts me into the world to come&mdash;may thy mercy yield com|fort to Horatio's heart, and teach Doli&s;cus the virtue of repentance!"</P>
<P>She ro&s;e and lifted the gla&s;s. At that in|&s;tant, a noi&s;e on the &s;tairs attracted her at|tention, and a voice anxiou&s;ly pronouncing &mdash;"It mu&s;t be &s;o! &mdash;nay, I will &s;ee her&mdash;" arre&s;ted the dreadful potion in its pa&s;&s;age to her lips. "It is my Amelia!" exclaimed Horatio, as he ha&s;tily entered the room.</P>
<P>Amelia &s;tarted, and looked for &s;ome mo|ments
<PB N="23" REF="033741_0154_0FF8FB96996ADDD0">
intently on her father, then ru&s;hed in|to his arms, and anxiou&s;ly concealed the &s;hame and agony of her countenance, in that bo&s;om, from which alone &s;he now dreaded reproach, or hoped for con&s;olation. He, too, beheld with horror the &s;cene that was pre|&s;ented to his view: he pre&s;&s;ed his deluded, mi&s;erable daughter, to his heart, while a &s;tream of tears ran freely down his cheeks; till, at length, his imagination, infected with the objects that &s;urrounded him, con|ceived the dreadful purpo&s;e of the draught, which had fallen from Amelia's hand, and anticipated a &s;orrow, even beyond the extremity of his pre&s;ent feelings. When, however, he collected &s;ufficient courage to re&s;olve his fears, and it was a&s;certained, that the meditated act had not been perpetrated, a momentary &s;en&s;ation of joy illuminated his mind, like the tran&s;ient appearance of the moon, amid&s;t the gloomy horrors of a mid|night &s;torm.</P>
<P>When the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions of this mourn|ful interview had pa&s;&s;ed away, Horatio &s;poke comfort to his daughter. "Come my child, the hand of Heaven, that afflicted us with worldly cares, has been &s;tretched out to guard you from everla&s;ting wretchedne&s;s: &mdash;that Providence which proves how vain

are the pur&s;uits of this life, has be&s;towed upon us the means of &s;eeking the permanent happine&s;s of that which is to come. Cheer up, my Amelia! The errors of our conduct may expo&s;e us to the &s;candal of the world, but it is guilt alone which can violate the inward tranquility of the mind." He then took her hand, and attempted to lead her to the door. "Let us withdraw from this me|lancholy &s;cene, my love!"&mdash;"Look there!" &s;aid Amelia, pointing to the corp&s;e. "Look there!" "Ah!" &s;aid Horatio, in a faultering accent-"but it is the will of Heaven!" "Then it is right," cried Amelia&mdash;"give the poor victim a little earth&mdash;&s;ir! is it not &s;ad to think of?&mdash;but I am reconciled." She now con&s;ent|ed to quit the room, and was conveyed in a carriage to the inn, at which Horatio (who immediately returned to &s;uperintend the in|terment of the child) had &s;topped on his arrival.</P>
<P>It is now proper to inform the reader, that after Amelia had left the Cottage, and the alarm of her elopement had &s;pread around the neighbourhood, the Farmer ha&s;tened to communicate to Horatio the tran&s;actions which he had witne&s;&s;ed, and the &s;u&s;picions which his wife had conceived of Amelia's &s;ituation. The wretched father &s;ickened at the tale. But it was the &s;enti|ment
<PB N="25" REF="033741_0156_0FF8FB9A9F9E1DC0">
of compa&s;&s;ion, and not of re&s;entment, that oppre&s;&s;ed his &s;oul. There are men, in|deed, &s;o abject in their &s;ubjection to the opinion of the world, that they can &s;acri|fice natural affection to artificial pride, and doom to perpetual infamy and wretched|ne&s;s, a child, who might be reclaimed from error by parental admonition, or rai&s;ed from de&s;pair by the fo&s;tering hand of friend&s;hip. Horatio, however, entertained a different &s;en&s;e: he regarded not the weakne&s;s of hu|man virtue as an object of accu&s;ation, but liberally di&s;tingui&s;hed between the crimes and the errors of mankind; and, when he could not alleviate the afflicted, or correct the vicious, he continued to lament, but he forebore to reprobate, "My poor Amelia! how ba&s;ely has her innocence been betrayed! &mdash;But I mu&s;t follow her:&mdash;it may be her in|juries have di&s;tracted her, and &s;he has fled, &s;he knows not whither! Come! not a moment &s;hall be lo&s;t: I will overtake my child, wherever her &s;orrows may lead her: for, if I cannot procure redre&s;s for her wrongs, I will, at lea&s;t, admini&s;ter comfort to her mi&s;eries." Such was the language of Horatio, as &s;oon as he could exerci&s;e the power of utterance. A few days enabled him to arrange his affairs, and having learn|ed
<PB N="26" REF="033741_0157_0FF8FB9D8D016050">
the route which Amelia had taken, he embarked in the fir&s;t ve&s;&s;el for England. The peculiar object of his voyage, and the nature of his misfortunes, determined him to conceal him&s;elf from the knowledge of his friends and corre&s;pondents; and a lucky chance di&s;covered the wretched abode of his Amelia, the very in&s;tant of his arrival in London.</P>
<P>"Can you tell me, ny good ho&s;t, where Doli&s;cus the lord&mdash;, re&s;ides?" &s;aid Ho|ratio as he entered the inn. "Marry, that I can," replied the landlord:" his &s;ervant is ju&s;t now talking with my wife; and if you will &s;tep into the next room, perhaps he will &s;how you the way to the hou&s;e." Horatio ad|vanced towards the room door, and, upon looking through a gla&s;s pannel in the door, he beheld the identical &s;ervant that had at|tended Doli&s;cus at the Cottage, in eager conver&s;ation with the ho&s;te&s;s. He pau&s;ed. "She is delivered; but the child is dead:" &mdash;&s;aid the &s;ervant. Horatio &s;tarted; his imagination eagerly interpreted the&s;e words to have been &s;poken of Amelia, and he could &s;carcely re&s;train the angui&s;h of his feelings from loud exclamation and com|plaint.&mdash;"My lord's con&s;cience grows un|u&s;ually trouble&s;ome" continued the &s;ervant;
<PB N="27" REF="033741_0158_0FF8FBA00EDC13C0">
"he has ordered me again to inquire after her health, and to provide for the funeral of the child&mdash;would &s;he were &s;afe in America! for, to be &s;ure, her father is the be&s;t old man that ever lived!" "It's well!" cried Horatio. "Did you call, &s;ir?" &s;aid the ho&s;te&s;s, opening the door. The &s;ervant took this opportunity of withdrawing, and Horatio &s;ilently followed him, at a di&s;tance, till he arrived at the habitation of Amelia, in the critical moment which enabled him to &s;ave the life he had given, and to re&s;cue his de|luded daughter from the de&s;perate &s;in of &s;uicide.</P>
<P>When Horatio returned to the inn, after di&s;charging the la&s;t &s;olemn duties to the de|parted infant, the landlord pre&s;ented a let|ter to him, which a &s;ervant had ju&s;t left at the bar, and a&s;ked if he was the per&s;on to whom it was addre&s;&s;ed. As &s;oon as Hora|tio had ca&s;t his eye upon the &s;uper&s;cription, he exclaimed, "What my&s;tery is this?&mdash;A letter left for my &s;on Honorius at an inn in London." He eagerly &s;eized the paper, and retiring into an adjoining chamber, he pe|ru&s;ed its contents with increa&s;ed amazement and agitation.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>The voice of Honorius, inquiring for the letter, rou&s;ed Horatio from the reverie into which its contents had plunged him. The honour of his &s;on, the villainy of his anta|goni&s;t, and Amelia's &s;ufferings, contending with the feelings of the father, and the for|bearance of the chri&s;tian, at la&s;t prevailed with him to &s;uffer the ho&s;tile interview to which Doli&s;cus had thus con&s;ented. When therefore Honorius entered the room, and the natural expre&s;&s;ions of tenderne&s;s and &s;urprize were mutually exchanged, they freely di&s;cour&s;ed of the lamentable hi&s;tory of Amelia, and warmly execrated that treachery which had accompli&s;hed the ruin of her peace and fame. Nor had Doli&s;cus confined his ba&s;ene&s;s to this object. The chance of war had thrown Honorius into his power &s;hortly after his departure from the cottage, and di&s;covering his affinity to Ame|lia,
<PB N="29" REF="033741_0160_0FF8FBA25697EB98">
the per&s;evering hypocrite artfully in&s;i|nuated to the commander in chief, that Ho|norius meditated an e&s;cape, and obtained an order for his impri&s;onment on board a frigate, which &s;ailing &s;uddenly for England, he was lodged upon his arrival, in the common gaol, appropriated for the confinement of American pri&s;oners. Here it was, howe|ver, that he acquired the information of Amelia's elopement, and heard the cau&s;e to which it was imputed from the captured ma&s;ter of an American ve&s;&s;el, who had for|merly been employed in the &s;ervice of Ho|ratio, and had received the communication from the lips of his ancient patron, in the fir&s;t moments of his grief. The fate which had unexpectedly led him to Britain, Ho|norius now regarded as the mini&s;ter of his revenge. He frowned away the tear which &s;tarted at the recital of his &s;i&s;ter's wrongs, as if a&s;hamed to pity 'till he had redre&s;&s;ed them; and feeling, upon this occa&s;ion, an additional motive for &s;oliciting his freedom, he employed the intere&s;t of Horatio's name, which notwith&s;tanding the political feuds that prevailed, was &s;ufficient, at length, to procure his di&s;charge upon parol. Having ea&s;ily learned the abode of Doli&s;cus, he im|mediately addre&s;&s;ed that note to him which
<PB N="30" REF="033741_0161_0FF8FBA499C09720">
produced the an&s;wer delivered to Horatio.</P>
<P>When Honorius was informed that Ame|lia was, at that time, beneath the &s;ame roof, he expre&s;&s;ed an eager de&s;ire immediately to embrace his afflicted &s;i&s;ter; but Horatio &s;trongly repre&s;ented the impropriety of an interview 'till the event of the a&s;&s;ignation with Doli&s;cus was a&s;certained, and it was, therefore, agreed for the pre&s;ent, to con|ceal his arrival from her knowledge.</P>
<P>Ab&s;orbed in the melancholy of her thoughts, Amelia had not uttered a &s;yllable &s;ince the removal from her dreary habitation, but &s;uffered the bu&s;y attention of the &s;er|vants of the inn, with a li&s;tle&s;s indifference. The agitation of her mind, indeed, had hitherto rendered her in&s;en&s;ible to the weak|ne&s;s of her frame; but exhau&s;ted nature, at length produced the &s;ymptoms of an ap|proaching fever, and compelled her, re|luctantly, to retire to her bed. When Ho|ratio entered the room, the fever had con|&s;iderably increa&s;ed, he therefore reque&s;ted the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a neighbouring phy&s;ician, who pronounced her &s;ituation to be criti|cally dangerous. In the evening, the un|u&s;ual vivacity of her eyes, the incoherence of her &s;peech, and repeated peals of loud and vacant laughter, proved the di&s;ordered
<PB N="31" REF="033741_0162_0FF8FBA6DE55EE20">
&s;tate of her under&s;tanding, and increa&s;ed the apprehen&s;ions of her attendants. "A few hours will decide her fate," &s;aid the Doctor, as he left the room. "My poor Amelia!" cried Horatio, rai&s;ing her hand to his lips&mdash;&s;he looked &s;ternly at him for a moment, then relaxing the &s;everity of her features, &s;he again bur&s;t into a boi&s;terous laugh, which terminated in a long and heavy &s;igh, as if her &s;pirits were exhau&s;ted with the violence of her exertions.</P>
<P>The ta&s;k which Horatio had now to per|form, was difficult indeed! The virtue and fortitude of his &s;oul could hardly &s;u&s;tain a conflict again&s;t the grief and pa&s;&s;ion that con&s;umed him; whil&s;t on the one hand, he beheld the di&s;traction of his daughter, and, on the other, anticipated the danger of his &s;on. He re&s;olved, however, to keep Ame|lia's indi&s;po&s;ition a &s;ecret from Honorius, with whom he arranged the dreadful bu&s;ine&s;s of the morning, and, having fervently be|&s;towed his ble&s;&s;ing there, he returned to pa&s;s the night in prayer and watching by Ame|lia's &s;ide.</P>
<P>Honorius retired to his chamber, but not to re&s;t. It was not, however, the danger of the approaching combat, which occa&s;i|oned a moment's anxiety or reflection; for
<PB N="32" REF="033741_0163_0FF8FBA95734EEE8">
his courage was &s;uperior to every con&s;idera|tion of per&s;onal &s;afety. But that courage had hitherto been regulated by a &s;en&s;e of obligation con&s;i&s;tent with the precepts of religion&mdash;he had often exerted it to de&s;erve the glorious meed of a &s;oldier, but he &s;corned to employ it for the contemptible re|putation of a duelli&s;t; it had taught him to &s;erve his country, but not to offend his God. "If there is a cau&s;e which can ju&s;tify the act, is it not mine? 'Tis not a punctilious honour, a vi&s;ionary in&s;ult, or a petulant di&s;|po&s;ition that influences my conduct:" &s;aid Honorius, as he mu&s;ed upon the &s;ubject. "A &s;i&s;ter ba&s;ely tricked of her innocence and fame, a father ungratefully plundered of his peace and hopes, in the la&s;t &s;tage of an honourable life, and my&s;elf (but that is little) treacherou&s;ly tran&s;ported to a remote and inho&s;pitable land&mdash;the&s;e are my mo|tives; and Heaven, Doli&s;cus, be the judge between us!"</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the dawn appeared, Honorius repaired to the place of appointment, where a few minutes before the hour, Doli&s;cus had likewi&s;e arrived. He was attended by a friend, but perceiving his antagoni&s;t alone, he reque&s;ted his companion to withdraw to a di&s;tant &s;pot, from which he might ob&s;erve
<PB N="33" REF="033741_0164_0FF8FBABA0961E08">
the event, and afford a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the van|qui&s;hed party.</P>
<P>"Once more we meet, Sir," &s;aid Doli&s;|cus, "upon the bu&s;ine&s;s of death; but that fortune which failed you in your country's cau&s;e, maybe more propitious in your own." "What pity it is," exclaimed Honorius,
<Q>that thou &s;hould'&s;t be a villain, for thou art brave!</Q>
"Nay, I come to offer a more &s;ub&s;tantial revenge for the wrongs I have committed, than merely &s;ubmitting to the im|putation of &s;o gro&s;s an epithet&mdash;take it, Sir,&mdash; it is my life." They in&s;tantly engaged. Doli&s;|cus for awhile defended him&s;elf with &s;uperior addre&s;s, but laying, him&s;elf &s;uddenly open to the pa&s;s of his antagoni&s;t, he received his &s;word in the left brea&s;t, a little below the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eat of the heart!</P>
<P>"Nobly done," cried Doli&s;cus as he fell, "it is the vengeance of Amelia; and oh! may it &s;erve to expiate the crime of her be|trayer." His friend who had attentively viewed the &s;cene, advanced, when he &s;aw him on the ground: and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Hono|rius, bore him to a carriage which had been directed to attend within call. He was then conveyed to the hou&s;e of an eminent &s;urge|on, who having ordered the nece&s;&s;ary ac|commodations, examined the wound, and
<PB N="34" REF="033741_0165_0FF8FBADE3FC5378">
pronounced it to be mortal." "Fly, &s;ir," &s;aid Doli&s;cus, turning to Honorius, at this intelligence&mdash;"your country will afford you an a&s;ylum, and protect you from the con&s;equences of my fate. I be&s;eech you embitter not my la&s;t moments with the re|flection of your danger&mdash;but bear with you to the injured Amelia, the &s;tory of my repentance, and, if you dare, a&s;k her to for|give me." The re&s;entments of Honorius were &s;ubdued; he pre&s;ented his hand to the dying Doli&s;cus, in who&s;e eye a gleam of joy was kindled at the thought, but it was quickly &s;uperceded by a cold and &s;udden tremour; he attempted, but in vain, to &s;peak; he &s;eized the offered hand; he pre&s;&s;ed it eagerly to his lips, and in the mo|ment of that expre&s;&s;ive action, he expired.</P>
<P>Honorius now ha&s;tened to inform Horatio of this fatal event, and to contrive the means of e&s;cape. But when he returned to the inn, confu&s;ion and di&s;tre&s;s were pictured on every face; a wild, but harmonious, voice, occa&s;ionally broke forth into melan|choly &s;trains, and the name of Doli&s;cus was repeatedly pronounced in accents of tender|ne&s;s and compa&s;&s;ion.&mdash;"How is it my &s;on?" cried Horatio eagerly. "Doli&s;cus is no more!" replied Honorius. "Would he
<PB N="35" REF="033741_0166_0FF8FBB0266A7518">
had lived another day! I wi&s;hed not the ruin of his &s;oul." "But he repented, &s;ir." "Then heaven be merciful!" exclaimed Horatio.</P>
<P>Here their conver&s;ation was interrupted, by the melodious chauntings of Amelia.</P>
<L>I'll have none of your flow'rs tho' &s;o blooming and &s;weet;</L>
<L>Their &s;cent, it may poi&s;on, and fal&s;e is their hue;</L>
<L>I tell you begone! for I ne'er &s;hall forget,</L>
<L>That Doli&s;cus was lovely and treacherous too.</L>
<P>Honorius li&s;tened attentively to the &s;ong; it vibrated in his ear, and &s;welled the aching artery of his heart. "Come on!" &s;aid Horatio leading him to Amelia's chamber. They found her &s;itting on the bed, with a pillow before her, over which &s;he moved her fingers, as if playing on a harp&s;ichord. Their entrance di&s;turbed her for a moment, but &s;he &s;oon re&s;umed her employment.</P>
<L>He &s;aid and he &s;wore he lov'd me true:&mdash;was it a lover's part,</L>
<L>To ruin good Horatio's peace and break Amelia's heart?</L>
<P>A heavy &s;igh followed the&s;e lines, which were articulated in a wi&s;tful and &s;ympathetic tone, and &s;he &s;unk exhau&s;ted on her bed. &mdash;In a few minutes, however, &s;he &s;tarted
<PB N="36" REF="033741_0167_0FF8C210822BF050">
from this &s;till and &s;ilent &s;tate, and having gazed with a wild and aching eye around the room, &s;he uttered a loud and piercing cry &mdash;it was the awful &s;ignal of her di&s;&s;olution &mdash;and her injured &s;pirit took its everla&s;t|ing flight.</P>
<P>The reader will excu&s;e a minute de&s;crip|tion of the &s;ucceeding &s;cenes. The alarm rai&s;ed by the death of Doli&s;cus compelled Honorius to quicken his departure, and he joined the &s;tandard of America a few hours before the battle of Monmouth, in which, for the &s;ervice of his country, he &s;acrificed a life that misfortune had then taught him to con&s;ider of no other u&s;e or e&s;timation.</P>
<P>As for the venerable Horatio&mdash;having carried with him to the cottage the remains of his darling child, in a melancholy &s;oli|tude he con&s;umes the time; his only bu&s;i|ne&s;s, meditation and prayer; his only re|creation a daily vi&s;it to the monument, which he has rai&s;ed in commemoration of Ame|lia's fate; and all his con&s;olation re&s;ting in this a&s;&s;urance, that whatever may be the &s;ufferings of virtue HERE, its portion mu&s;t be happine&s;s HEREAFTER.</P>

<HEAD>HISTORY OF AMELIA, OR MALEVOLENCE DEFEATED.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. Winifrid Wormwood was the daugh|ter of a ru&s;tic merchant, who, by the happy union of many lucrative trades, ama&s;&s;ed an enormous fortune. His family con&s;i&s;ted of three girls, and Winifrid was the elde&s;t: Long before &s;he was twenty, &s;he was &s;ur|rounded with lovers, &s;ome probably attract|ed by the &s;plendid pro&s;pect of her expected portion, and others truly captivated by her per&s;onal graces; for her per&s;on was elegant, and her elegance was enlivened with peculiar vivacity. Mr. Wormwood was commonly called a kind parent, and an hone&s;t man; and he might de&s;erve, indeed, tho&s;e honor|able appellations, if it were not a profanation of language to apply them to a narrow and a &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit. He indulged his daughters in many expen&s;ive amu&s;ements, becau&s;e it flattered his pride; but his heart was engro&s;&s;|ed
<PB N="38" REF="033741_0169_0FF8FBB269F02138">
by the proffits of his exten&s;ive traffic: He turned, with the mo&s;t repul&s;ive a&s;perity, from every propo&s;al that could lead him to dimini&s;h his capital, and thought his daughters unrea&s;onable, if they wi&s;hed for any permanent &s;atisfaction above that of &s;ee|ing their father increa&s;e in opulence and &s;plendor. His two younger children, who inherited from their di&s;ea&s;ed mother a ten|der delicacy of frame, langui&s;hed and died at an early period of life, and the death of one of them was imputed, with great pro|bability, to a &s;evere di&s;appointment in her fir&s;t affection. The more &s;prightly Wini|frid, who&s;e heart was a perfect &s;tranger to genuine love, &s;urmounted the mortification of &s;eeing many &s;uitors di&s;carded; and by the in&s;en&s;ate avarice of her father, &s;he was na|turally led into habits of artifice and in|trigue. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing an uncommon &s;hare of ve|ry &s;hrewd and piercing wit, with the mo&s;t profound hypocri&s;y, &s;he contrived to plea&s;e, and to blind, her plodding old parent; who perpetually harangued on the di&s;cretion of his daughter, and believed her a miracle of re&s;erve and prudence, at the very time when &s;he was &s;u&s;pected of &s;uch conduct as would have di&s;qualified her, had it ever been prov|ed, for the rank &s;he now holds in this e&s;&s;ay.
<PB N="39" REF="033741_0170_0FF8FBB72EE6E988">
She was &s;aid to have amu&s;ed her&s;elf with a great variety of amorous adventures, which eluded the ob&s;ervation of her father; but of the many lovers who &s;ighed to her in &s;ecret, not one could tempt her into marriage, and, to the &s;urpri&s;e of the public, the rich heire&s;s of Mr. Wormwood reached the age of thir|ty-&s;even, without changing her name. Ju&s;t as &s;he arrived at this mature &s;ea&s;on of life, the opulent old gentleman took his leave of a world, in which he had acted a bu&s;y part, plea&s;ed with the idea of leaving a large for|tune, as a monument of his indu&s;try, but wanting the &s;uperior &s;atisfation, which a more generous parent would probably have derived from the happy e&s;tabli&s;hment of a daughter. He gained, however, from the hypocri&s;y of Winifrid, what he could not claim from her affection, the honour of be|ing lamented with a profu&s;ion of tears. She di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tingui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hed her&s;elf by di&s;playing all the delicate gradations of filial &s;orrow; but re|covered at a proper time, all the natural gaiety of her temper, which &s;he now had the full opportunity of indulging, being mi&s;|tre&s;s of a magnificent man&s;ion, within a mile of a populous town, and enabled to enliven it with all the arts of luxury, by inheriting &s;uch accumulated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ealth, as would &s;afely
<PB N="40" REF="033741_0171_0FF8FBB973DABC08">
&s;upport the utmo&s;t efforts of provincial &s;plen|dor. Mi&s;s Wormwood now expected to &s;ee every batchelor of figure and con&s;equence a &s;uppliant at her feet; &s;he promi&s;ed to her&s;elf no little entertainment in &s;porting with their addre&s;&s;es, without the fear of &s;uffering from a tyrannical hu&s;band, as &s;he had learned cau|tion from her father, and had privately re|&s;olved not to tru&s;t any man with her money; a re&s;olution the more di&s;creet, as &s;he had much to apprehend, and very little to learn, from &s;o dangerous a ma&s;ter! The good-natured town, in who&s;e environs the rich Winifrid re&s;ided, very kindly pointed out to her no le&s;s than twenry lively beaux for her choice; but, to the &s;hame or the honour of tho&s;e gentlemen, they were too timid, or, too hone&s;t, to make any advances. The re|port of her youthful frolics, and the dread of her &s;arca&s;tic wit, had more power to re|pel, than her per&s;on and her wealth had to attract. Pa&s;&s;ing her fiftieth year, &s;he ac|quired the &s;erious name of mi&s;tre&s;s, without the dignity of a wife, and without receiving a &s;ingle offer of marriage from the period in which &s;he became the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of &s;o opulent a fortune.</P>
<P>Whether this mortifying di&s;appointment had given a peculiar a&s;perity to her temper

or whether malevolence was the earlier cha|racteri&s;tic of her mind, I will not pretend to determine; but it is certain, that from this autumnal or rather wintry &s;ea&s;on of her life, Mrs. Wormwood made it her chief occup<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|tion to amu&s;e her&s;elf with the mo&s;t &s;ubtle devices of malicious ingenuity, and to fru&s;|trate every promi&s;ing &s;cheme of affection and delight, which &s;he di&s;covered in the wide circle of her acquaintance. She &s;eemed to be tormented with an ince&s;&s;ant dread, that youth and beauty might &s;ecure to them&s;elves that happine&s;s, which &s;he found wit and for|tune were unable to be&s;tow; hence &s;he watch|ed, with the mo&s;t piercing eye, all the lovely young women of her neighbourhood, and often in&s;inuated her&s;elf into the confidence of many, that &s;he might penetrate all the &s;ecrets of their love, and privately bla&s;t its &s;ucce&s;s. She was enabled to render her&s;elf intimate with the young and the lovely, by the opulent &s;plendor in which &s;he lived, and by the bewitching vivacity of her conver&s;ati|on. Her talents of this kind were, indeed, extraordinary; her mind was never poli&s;hed or enriched by literature, as Mr. Wormwood &s;et little value on any books, excepting tho&s;e of his counting-hou&s;e; and the earlier years of his daughter were too much engaged by

duplicity and intrigue, to leave her either lei&s;ure or inclination for a voluntary attach|ment to more improving &s;tudies. She read very little, and was acquainted with no lan|guage but her own; yet a brilliant under|&s;tanding, and an uncommon portion of ready wit, &s;upplied her with a more alluring fund of conver&s;ation, than learning could be&s;tow. She chiefly recommended her&s;elf to the young and inexperienced, by the in&s;inuating charm of the mo&s;t lively ridicule, and by the art of &s;ea&s;oning her di&s;cour&s;e with want|ton inuendos of &s;o &s;ubtle a nature, that gravity knew not how to object to them: She had the &s;ingular faculty of throwing &s;uch a &s;oft and dubious twilight over the mo&s;t li|centious images, that they captivated curio|&s;ity and attention, without exciting either fear or di&s;gu&s;t.

was effectually &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by her mode&s;ty; and &s;he continued to wa&s;te the mo&s;t precious time of her youth, under the mortification of perpetualy wi&s;hing to change her mode of life, and of not knowing how to effect it. Almo&s;t two years had now elap|&s;ed &s;ince the death of her aunt, and without any pro&s;pect of marriage, &s;he was now in her &s;econd period of re&s;idence with Mrs. Wormwood. Amelia's under&s;tanding was by no means inferior to her other endow|ments: &s;he began to penetrate all the art|ful di&s;gui&s;e, and to gain a perfect and very painful in&s;ight into the real character of her pre&s;ent ho&s;te&s;s. This lady had remarked, that when Mi&s;s Nevil re&s;ided with her, her hou&s;e was much more frequented by gen|tlemen, than at any other &s;ea&s;on. This, in|deed, was true; and it unluckily happened, that the&s;e vi&s;itors often forgot to applaud the &s;mart &s;ayings of Mrs. Wormwood, in con|templating the &s;weet countenance of Amelia; a circum&s;tance full &s;ufficient to awaken, in the neglected wit, the mo&s;t bitter envy, ha|tred and malice. In truth, Mrs. Worm|wood dete&s;ted her lovely gue&s;t with the mo&s;t implacable virulence; but &s;he had the &s;in|gular art of di&s;gui&s;ing her dete&s;tation in the
<PB N="48" REF="033741_0179_0FF8FBCA03B562F8">
language of flattery: &s;he under&s;tood the truth of Pope's maxim,</P>
<P>"<HI>He hurts me mo&s;t who lavi&s;hly commends.</HI>" and &s;he therefore made u&s;e of lavi&s;h com|mendations, as an in&s;trument of malevolence towards Amelia; &s;he in&s;ulted the ta&s;te, and ridiculed the choice, of every new-married man, and declared her&s;elf convinced, that he was a fool, becau&s;e he had not cho&s;en that mo&s;t lovely young woman. To more than one gentleman &s;he &s;aid, you mu&s;t mar|ry Amelia; and, as few men chu&s;e to be driven into wedlock, &s;ome offers were po&s;&s;i|bly prevented, by the treacherous vehem|ence of her prai&s;e. Her malice, however, was not &s;ufficiently gratified by ob&s;erving that Amelia had no pro&s;pect of marriage. To indulge her malignity, &s;he re&s;olved to a|mu&s;e this unhappy girl with the hopes of &s;uch a joyous event, and then to turn, on a &s;udden, all the&s;e &s;plendid hopes into mocke|ry and delu&s;ion. Accident led her to pitch on Mr. Nel&s;on, as a per&s;on who&s;e name &s;he might with the greate&s;t &s;afety employ, as the in&s;trument of her in&s;idious de&s;ign, and with the greater chance of &s;ucce&s;s, as &s;he ob|&s;erved that Amelia had conceived for him a particular regard. Mr. Nel&s;on was a gen|tleman, who, having met with very &s;ingu|lar
<PB N="49" REF="033741_0180_0FF8FBCC45051C48">
events, had contracted a great, but very amiable &s;ingularity of character:&mdash;he was placed early in life, in a very lucrative com|mercial &s;ituation, and was on the point of &s;ettling happily in marriage with a very beau|tiful young lady, when the hou&s;e, in which &s;he re&s;ided, was con&s;umed by fire. Great part of her family, and among them the de&s;tined bride, was buried in the ruins. Mr. Nel|&s;on, in loo&s;ing the object of his ardent af|fection by &s;o &s;udden a calamity, lo&s;t for &s;ome time the u&s;e of his rea&s;on; and when his health and &s;en&s;es returned, he &s;till con|tinued under the oppre&s;&s;ion of the profound|e&s;t melancholy, till his fond devotion to the memory of her, whom he had lo&s;t in &s;o &s;evere a manner, &s;ugge&s;ted to his fancy a &s;ingular plan of benevolence, in the pro&s;e|cution of which he recovered a great por|tion of his former &s;pirits. This plan con|&s;i&s;ted in &s;earching for female objects of charity, who&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es had been occa&s;ion|ed by fire. As his fortune was very ample, and his own private expences very mode|rate, he was able to relieve many unfortu|nate per&s;ons in this condition; and his affectionate imagination delighted it&s;elf with the idea, that in the&s;e uncommon acts of beneficence he was guided by the influ|ence
<PB N="50" REF="033741_0181_0FF8FBCE8A4AFE98">
of that lovely angel, who&s;e mortal beau|ty had peri&s;hed in the flames. Mr. Nel&s;on frequently vi&s;ited a married &s;i&s;ter, who was &s;ettled in the town where Mrs. Wormwood re&s;ided. There was al&s;o, in the &s;ame town, an amiable elderly widow, for whom he had a particular e&s;teem. This lady, who&s;e name was Melford, had been left in very &s;canty circum&s;tances on the death of her hu&s;band, and re&s;ided at that time in London, where &s;he had been involved in additional di&s;tre&s;s by that calamity, to which the attentive cha|rity of Mr. Nel&s;on was forever directed: he more than repaired the lo&s;s which &s;he &s;u&s;|tained by fire, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in &s;ettling her in the neighbourhood of his &s;i&s;ter. Mrs. Mel|ford had been intimate with the aunt of Amelia, and was &s;till the mo&s;t valuable friend of that lovely orphan, who paid her frequent vi&s;its, though &s;he never re&s;ided under her roof. Mr. Nel&s;on had often &s;een Amelia at the hou&s;e of Mrs. Melford, which led him to treat her with particular politene&s;s, whenever he vi&s;ited Mrs. Wormwood; a circum&s;tance on which the latter founded her ungenerous project&punc; She perfectly knew all the &s;ingular private hi&s;tory of Mr. Nel&s;on, and firmly believed, like all the re&s;t of his acquaintance, that no attractions could ever tempt him to marry; but &s;he thought
<PB N="51" REF="033741_0182_0FF8FBD10B03AFD8">
it po&s;&s;ible to make Amelia conceive the hope that her beauty had melted his re&s;olution; and nothing &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, could more effect|ually mortify her gue&s;t, than to find her&s;elf derided for &s;o vain an expectation.</P>
<P>Mrs. Wormwood began, therefore, to in&s;inuate, in the mo&s;t artful manner, that Mr. Nel&s;on was very particular in his civil|ities to Amelia, magnified all his amiable qualities, and expre&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t plea&s;ure in the pro&s;pect of &s;o delightful a match. The&s;e petty artifices, however, had no ef|fect on the natural mode&s;ty and diffidence of Amelia; &s;he &s;aw nothing that authori&s;ed &s;uch an idea in the u&s;ual politene&s;s of a well-bred man of thirty-&s;even; &s;he pitied the misfortune, &s;he admired the elegant and engaging, though &s;erious manners, and &s;he revered the virtues of Mr. Nel&s;on; but, &s;uppo&s;ed his mind to be entirely engro&s;&s;ed, as it really was, by his &s;ingularly charitable pur&s;uits; &s;he entertained not a thought of engaging his affection. Mrs. Wormwood was determined to play off her favourite en|gine of malignity, a counterfeited letter. She had acquired, in her youth, the very danger|rous talent of forging any hand that &s;he plea&s;ed; and her pa&s;&s;ion for mi&s;chief had af|forded her much practice in this treacherous
<PB N="52" REF="033741_0183_0FF8FBD2A66AE278">
art. Having previou&s;ly and &s;ecretly enga|ged Mr. Nel&s;on to drink tea with her, &s;he wrote a billet to Amelia, in the name of that gentleman, and with the mo&s;t perfect imita|tion of his hand. The billet &s;aid, that he de&s;igned him&s;elf the plea&s;ure of pa&s;&s;ing that afternoon at the hou&s;e of Mrs. Wormwood, and reque&s;ted the favour of a private confer|ence with Mi&s;s Nevil in the cour&s;e of the evening, intimating, in the mo&s;t delicate and doubtful terms, an ardent de&s;ire of be|coming her hu&s;band. Mrs. Wormwood contrived that Amelia &s;hould not receive this billet till ju&s;t before dinner-time, that &s;he might not &s;how it to her friend and con|fidant, Mrs. Melford, and by her means, de|tect its fallacy before the hour of her intend|ed humiliation arrived.</P>
<P>Amelia blu&s;hed in reading the note, and, in the fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;e of un&s;u&s;pecting innocence, gave it to the vigilant Mrs. Wormwood; who bur&s;t into vehement expre&s;&s;ions of de|light; congratulated her blu&s;hing gue&s;t on the full &s;ucce&s;s of her charms, and triumph|ed in her own prophetic di&s;cernment. They &s;at down to dinner, but poor Amelia could hardly &s;wallow a mor&s;el; her mind was in a tumultuous agitation of plea&s;ure and a|mazement. The malicious impo&s;ter, en|joying her confu&s;ion, allowed her no time
<PB N="53" REF="033741_0184_0FF8FBD598231B90">
to compo&s;e her hurried &s;pirits in the &s;olitude of her chamber. Some female vi&s;itors ar|rived to tea; and, at length, Mr. Nel&s;on entered the room. Amelia trembled and blu&s;hed as he approached her; but &s;he was a little relieved from her embarra&s;&s;ment by the bu&s;ine&s;s of the tea-table, over which &s;he pre&s;ided. Amelia was naturally graceful in every thing &s;he did, but the pre&s;ent agi|tation of her mind gave a temporary awk|wardne&s;s to all her motions: &s;he committed many little blunders in the management of the tea-table; a cup fell from her trembling hand, and was broken; but the politene&s;s of Mr. Nel&s;on led him to &s;ay &s;o many kind and graceful things to her on the&s;e petty in|cidents, that, in&s;tead of encrea&s;ing her di&s;|tre&s;s, they produced an oppo&s;ite effect, and the tumult of her bo&s;om gradually &s;ub&s;ided into a calm and compo&s;ed delight. She ventured to meet the eyes of Mr. Nel&s;on, and thought them expre&s;&s;ive of that tender|ne&s;s which promi&s;ed a happy end to all her misfortunes. At the idea of exchanging mi&s;ery and dependance for comfort and honor, as the wife of &s;o amiable a man, her heart expanded with the mo&s;t innocent and grateful joy. This appeared in her counte|nance, and gave &s;uch an exqui&s;ite radiance to
<PB N="54" REF="033741_0185_0FF8C2159BB05D18">
all her features, that &s;he looked a thou|&s;and times more beautiful than ever. Mrs. Wormwood &s;aw this improvement of her charms, and, &s;ickening at the &s;ight, deter|mined to reduce the &s;plendor of &s;uch in&s;uf|ferable beauty, and ha&s;tily terminate the tri|umph of her deluded gue&s;t. She began with a few malicious and &s;arca&s;tic remarks on the vanity of beautiful young women, and the hopes, which they frequently enter|tain of an imaginary lover; but finding the&s;e remarks produced not the effect &s;he in|tended, &s;he took an opportunity of whi&s;per|ing in the ear of Amelia, and begged her not to harbour any vain expectations, for the billet &s;he had received was a counter|feit, and a mere piece of plea&s;antry. Ame|lia &s;huddered, and turned pale: &s;urpri&s;e, di&s;appointment, and indignation, con&s;pired to overwhelm her. She exerted her utmo&s;t power to conceal her emotions; but the conflict in her bo&s;om was too violent to be di&s;gui&s;ed. The tears, which &s;he vainly en|deavoured to &s;uppre&s;s, bur&s;t forth, and &s;he was obliged to quit the room in very vi&s;ible di&s;order. Mr. Nel&s;on expre&s;&s;ed his con|cern; but he was checked in his benevolent inquiries by the caution of Mrs. Wormwood, who &s;aid; on the occa&s;ion, that Mi&s;s Nevil
<PB N="55" REF="033741_0186_0FF8FBD7DB81EE60">
was a very amiable girl, but &s;he had &s;ome peculiarities of temper and was apt to put a wrong con&s;truction on the innocent plea|&s;antry of her friends. Mr. Nel&s;on ob&s;erving that Amelia did not return, and hoping that his departure might contribute to re&s;tore the interrupted harmony of the hou&s;e, took an early leave of Mrs. Wormwood; who im|mediately flew to the chamber of Amelia, to exult, like a fiend, over that lovely vic|tim of her &s;ucce&s;sful malignity. She found not the per&s;on whom &s;he was &s;o eager to in|&s;ult. Amelia had, indeed, retired to her chamber, and pa&s;&s;ed there a very mi&s;erable half hour, much hurt by the treacherous cruelty of Mrs. Wormwood, and &s;till more wounded by reflections on her own credulity, which &s;he condemned with that exce&s;s of &s;everity &s;o natural to a delicate mind in ar|raigning it&s;elf. She would have flown for immediate con&s;olation to her friend, Mrs. Melford, but &s;he had rea&s;on to believe that lady engaged on a vi&s;it, and &s;he therefore re&s;olved to take a &s;olitary walk for the pur|po&s;e of compo&s;ing her &s;pirits; but neither &s;olitude nor exerci&s;e could re&s;tore her tran|quillity; and, as it grew late in the evening, &s;he ha&s;tened to Mrs. Melford's, in hopes of now finding her returned. Her worthy old
<PB N="56" REF="033741_0187_0FF8FBDA592BAE08">
confidant was, indeed, in her little parlour alone, when Amelia entered the room. The eyes of this lovely girl immediately betray|ed her di&s;tre&s;s; and the old lady, with her u&s;ual tenderne&s;s, exclaimed, "Good heav|en! my dear child, for what have you been crying?" "Becau&s;e," replied Amelia, in a broken voice, and bur&s;ting into a fre&s;h &s;how|er of tears, "becau&s;e I am a fool?"&mdash;Mrs. Melford began to be mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly alarmed, and, expre&s;&s;ing her maternal &s;olicitude in the kinde&s;t manner. Amelia produced the fatal paper&mdash;"There," &s;ays &s;he, "is a letter in the name of your excellent friend, Mr. Nel&s;on; it is a forgery of Mrs. Wormwood's, and I have been &s;uch an idiot as to believe it real." The affectionate Mrs. Melford, who in her fir&s;t alarm, had apprehended a much heavier calamity, was her&s;elf greatly com|forted in di&s;covering the truth, and &s;aid many kind things to con&s;ole her young friend. "Do not fancy," replied Amelia, "that I am fooli&s;hly in love with Mr. Nel&s;on, though I think him the mo&s;t plea&s;ing as well as the mo&s;t excellent, of men; and though I confe&s;s to you, that I &s;hould certainly think it a ble&s;&s;ed lot to find a refuge from the mi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry of my pre&s;ent dependance, in the arms of &s;o benevolent and &s;o generous
<PB N="57" REF="033741_0188_0FF8FBDBF456F4D0">
a protector."&mdash;"Tho&s;e arms are now open to receive you," &s;aid a voice that was heard before the &s;peaker appeared. Amelia &s;tarted at the &s;ound, and her &s;urpri&s;e was not a little encrea&s;ed in &s;eeing Mr. Nel&s;on him|&s;elf, who entering the room from an adjoin|ing apartment, embraced the lovely orphan in a tran&s;port of tenderne&s;s and delight. Amelia, alive to all the feelings of genuine mode&s;ty, was for &s;ome minutes more pain|fully di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by this &s;urpri&s;e, than &s;he had been by her pa&s;t mortification: &s;he was ready to &s;ink into the earth, at the idea of having betrayed her &s;ecret to the man, from whom &s;he would have laboured mo&s;t to conceal it. In the fir&s;t tumult of this delicate confu&s;ion, &s;he &s;inks into a chair, and hides her face in her handkerchief. Nel&s;on with a mixture of re&s;pect and love, being a|fraid of encrea&s;ing her di&s;tre&s;s, &s;eizes one of her hands, and continues to ki&s;s it without uttering a word. The good Mrs. Melford, almo&s;t as much a&s;toni&s;hed, but le&s;s painful|ly confu&s;ed than Amelia, beholds this unex|pected &s;cene with that kind of joy which is much more di&s;po&s;ed to weep than to &s;peak &mdash;And, while this little party is thus ab&s;orb|ed in &s;ilence, let me ha&s;ten to relate the in|cidents which produced their &s;ituation.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="033741_0189_0FF8C1F76E374C80">Mr. Nel&s;on had ob&s;erved the &s;arca&s;tic manner of Mrs. Wormwood towards Ame|lia, and, as &s;oon as he had ended his uncom|fortable vi&s;it, he ha&s;tened to the worthy Mrs. Melford, to give her &s;ome little account of what had pa&s;&s;ed, and to concert with her &s;ome happier plan for the &s;upport of this a|miable, in&s;ulted orphan. "I am acquaint|ed," &s;aid he, "with &s;ome brave and weal|thy officers, who have &s;erved with the father of Mi&s;s Nevil, and often &s;peak of him with re&s;pect; I am &s;ure I can rai&s;e among them a &s;ub&s;cription for the maintenance of this tender unfortunate girl: we will procure for her an annuity, that &s;hall enable her to e&s;cape from &s;uch malignant patronage, to have a little home of her own, and to &s;up|port a &s;ervant." Mrs. Melford was tran&s;|ported at this idea; and, recollecting all her obligations to this benevolent man, wept, and extolled his genero&s;ity; and, &s;ee|ing Amelia at &s;ome di&s;tance, through a bow window, which commanded the &s;treet in which &s;he lived, "thank Heaven," &s;he cri|ed, "here comes my poor child, to hear and ble&s;s you for the extent of your goodne&s;s." Nel&s;on, who delighted mo&s;t in doing good by &s;tealth, immediately extorted from the good old lady a promi&s;e of &s;ecrecy: it was the be&s;t part of his plan, that Amelia &s;hould
<PB N="59" REF="033741_0190_0FF8FBE1556E05E0">
never know the per&s;ons to whom &s;he was to owe her independence. "I am &s;till afraid of you, my worthy old friend," &s;aid Nel&s;on "your countenance or manner will, I know betray me, if Mi&s;s Nevil &s;ees me here to|night."&mdash;"Well," &s;aid the delighted old la|dy, "I will humour your delicacy; Amelia will, probably, not &s;tay with me ten min|utes; you may amu&s;e your&s;elf, for that time, in my &s;pacious garden; I will not &s;ay you are here; and, as &s;oon as the good girl re|turns home I will come and impart to you the particulars of her recent vexation."&mdash; "Admirably &s;ettled," cried Nel&s;on; and he immediately retreated into a little back room, which led into a long &s;lip of ground, embelli&s;hed with the &s;weete&s;t and lea&s;t ex|pen&s;ive flowers, which afforded a favourite occupation and amu&s;ement to Mrs. Mel|ford. Nel&s;on, after taking a few turns in this diminutive garden, finding him&s;elf ra|ther chilled by the air of the evening, re|treated again into the little parlour he had pa&s;&s;ed, intending to wait there till Amelia departed; but the partition between the parlours being extremely &s;light, he over|heard the tender confe&s;&s;ions of Amelia, and was hurried towards her by an irre&s;i&s;tible impul&s;e, in the manner already de&s;cribed.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="033741_0191_0FF8FBE3123B4450">Mrs. Melford was the fir&s;t who recovered from the kind of trance into which our little party had been thrown by their general &s;ur|pri&s;e; and &s;he enabled the tender pair, in the pro&s;pect of who&s;e union her warm heart exulted, to regain that ea&s;y and joyous po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of their faculties, which they lo&s;t for &s;ome little time in their embarra&s;&s;ment. The applau&s;e of her friend, and the adoration of her lover, &s;oon taught the diffident Amelia to think le&s;s &s;everely of her&s;elf. The warm|hearted Mrs. Melford declared that the&s;e oc|currences were the work of Heaven. "That," replied the affectionate Nel&s;on, "I am mo&s;t willing to allow; but you mu&s;t grant, that Heaven has produced our happine&s;s by the blind agency of a fiend; and, as our dear Amelia has too gentle a &s;pirit to rejoice in beholding the malignity of a devil convert|ed into the torment of its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, I mu&s;t beg, that &s;he may not return, even for a &s;in|gle night, to the hou&s;e of Mrs. Wormwood." Amelia pleaded her &s;en&s;e of pa&s;t obligations, and wi&s;hed to take a peaceful leave of her patrone&s;s; but &s;he &s;ubmitted to the urgent entreaties of Nel&s;on, and remained for a few weeks under the roof of Mrs. Melford, when &s;he was united to the man of her heart. Nel&s;on had the double delight of rewarding
<PB N="61" REF="033741_0192_0FF8FBE5FA4FB048">
the affection of an angel, and of puni&s;hing the malevolence of a fiend: he announced in per&s;on to Mrs. Wormwood, his intended marriage with Amelia, on the very night when the treacherous Old Maid had amu&s;ed her&s;elf with the hope of deriding her gue&s;t; who&s;e return &s;he was eagerly expecting, in the very moment Nel&s;on arrived to &s;ay, that Amelia would return no more.</P>
<P>The &s;urpri&s;e and mortification of Mrs. Wormwood aro&s;e almo&s;t to frenzy; &s;he racked her malicious and inventive brain for expedients to defeat the match, and cir|culated a report for that purpo&s;e, which de|cency will not allow me to explain. Her artifice was detected and de&s;pi&s;ed. Amelia was not only married, but the mo&s;t admir|ed, the mo&s;t beloved, and the happie&s;t of human beings; an event which preyed &s;o ince&s;&s;antly on the &s;pirit of Mrs- Wormwood, that &s;he fell into a rapid decline, and ended, in a few months, her mi&s;chievous and un|happy life, a memorable example, that the mo&s;t artful malignity may &s;ometimes procure for the object of its envy, that very happi|ne&s;s which it labours to prevent!</P>
