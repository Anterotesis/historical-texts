<HEAD>HIS EXCELLENCY'S SPEECH, TO THE HONOURABLE THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY <HI>MARYLAND,</HI>
<DATE><HI>April</HI> the 26<HI>th. Anno Domini</HI> 1700.</DATE></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have now had a Year and an half's Experience of me, which I hope will Confirm you in the Truth of what I have publickly a&s;&s;ured you of, my be&s;t En|deavours for your Service, which I promi&s;e I will allways ju&s;tly perform.</P>
<P>I cannot but acknowledge that all your Actions in our la&s;t meeting gave me great &s;atisfaction, for it was managed with that Accord and good agreement, that there was not the lea&s;t &s;hadow or Colour for any ill di&s;po&s;ed People to make any malitious remarks upon: And that good Under&s;tanding which we were &s;o happy at fir&s;t to Create, will I hope be mutually pre&s;erved on both &s;ides; as it is my fixed Re&s;olution it &s;hall be inviolably on mine. After which I will give you all the convincing Proofs of what I have &s;olemnly averred, in my Regards for the Province in General, and every one of you in Particular. Wherefore if you labour under any difficulties, I am ready to redre&s;s them and a&s;&s;ure you I will &s;uppre&s;s all unnece&s;&s;ary charges and expences to make you ea&s;y, And have the Vanity to believe your Examination of the publick Accounts will convince you of what I have already done in that, not having &s;ince the la&s;t ASSEMBLY, which is Ten Months ago, Entailed Ten Pounds Charge upon you, or any individual Per&s;on in the Province: But on the contrary, Averted what lay in my Power.</P>
<P><HI>GENTLEMEN,</HI></P>
<P>SINCE it is and ought to be the Great End of all GENERAL ASSEMBLY'S, to con&s;ult the Honour of GOD and the Service of their King and Countrey, the Ignominious Report which is handed about by &s;ome, leads me to acquaint you of an Order of his Mo&s;t Sacred MAJESTY in Council, for the di&s;anulling the Law which is Entituled the <HI>Act for E&s;tabli&s;h|ing the Prote&s;tant Religion.</HI> The Repealing the &s;aid Law, gives no Room to any Per&s;on to &s;ugge&s;t it's being di&s;a&s;&s;ented to, upon any other grounds then it mentions; you having clog|ged and loaded it with things of different Natures, which I hope you will wi&s;ely Correct with|out the lea&s;t He&s;itation. For we are happy under the Wings and Protection of a Prince who&s;e Delight is to run the greate&s;t Hazards for the Con&s;ervation of our Property's, and never yet ob&s;tructed his People in pur&s;uing that Ble&s;&s;ed Name of Liberty.</P>
<P>YOU are &s;en&s;ible how u&s;eful Religion is in the good Government of a Nation or Province. It's the uniting the People, the keeping Men good, and deterring them from committing of Rapines of all degrees, upon each other. Much may be &s;aid upon this Subject, which is not &s;o proper here, and not being my Tallent, neither is it nece&s;&s;ary, where I am morally a&s;&s;ured tho&s;e Per&s;ons to whom I apply, are &s;o well inclined, and are &s;o good Judges of the Fatal Con|&s;equences would attend us in the Lo&s;s of that good Law.</P>
<P><HI>GENTLEMEN,</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall not here enumerate what other affairs we are to concert this Se&s;&s;ions of A&s;&s;embly, but will leave you to proceed in the u&s;ual way of Conference and Me&s;&s;age, being ready to joyn with you wherein we may promote his Maje&s;ty's Service, on which depends the Good of this Province.</P>

<HEAD>THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY'S ANSWER TO HIS EXCELLENCY'S SPEECH</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE have ob&s;erved the Progre&s;s of your EXCELLENCY'S Government, and grate|fully acknowledge your &s;incere endeavours for the good of his MAJESTY's Leige People in this Province; And without any jealou&s;ies a&s;&s;ure our &s;elves the &s;ame for the future</P>
<P>WE are extreamly &s;atisfied to have your Excellency acknowledge our Actions in the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ions to have been to your &s;atisfaction. We a&s;&s;ure your Excellency we are come again with the &s;ame Candid and Hone&s;t Re&s;olution, inviolably to maintain the &s;ame good agreement, and right under&s;tanding, which hath hitherto been betwixt us; And confe&s;s have had convin|cing proofs of your Excellency's reguard for the Province in general, and every one of us in particular.</P>
<P>WE thankfully acknowledge your Excellency hath managed the affairs of this Province with the lea&s;t charge, and expence that could be. Your Government hath been di&s;ce<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">, ju&s;t, ea&s;y, and mo&s;t acceptable to us all; and if any difficulties come upon this Province and us, we will never &s;editiou&s;ly, factiou&s;ly, nor with anger and reflections &s;ecretly murmur and grumble, But with upright and hone&s;t hearts, according to our duty, with Candour and Freedom in proper place, will repre&s;ent &s;uch grievances to your Excellency, being intirely confident of your Excellency's Redre&s;s, and in the mean time we have no apprehen&s;ion that any difficulty will be to us by your Excellency's procurement.</P>
<P>THE Glory of GOD. And the Advancement of this his Maje&s;ty's Province, and good Corre&s;pondency with our neighbouring Colonys &s;hall be our endeavours. And if his Maje&s;ty hath been plea&s;ed to Repeal the pre&s;ent Act for e&s;tabli<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">hing the Prote&s;tant Religion, yet will we not be di&s;couraged, but endeavour by your Excellency's Conduct, to adju<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">t matters &s;o a|greeable to his Maje&s;ties Plea&s;ure, and the general &s;atisfaction of this Province; that we hope his Maje&s;ty, will <HI>at length by Law e&s;tabli&s;h Religion among&s;t us according to the Church of England</HI>; that our Children and Po&s;terity being pre&s;erved in the unity of the Church, from Faction and Schi&s;m in Hone&s;ty and Charity, may become good and &s;ober Men loving Virtue, flying Vice, the rational con&s;equence of true Chri&s;tian Doctrine, which God pre&s;erve among&s;t us. We never had the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ion of his Maje&s;ties ob&s;tructing our Liberty, and we have a &s;ufficient a&s;&s;urance of his Royal Atchievements for the pre&s;ervation of it. If it be at any time unju&s;tly ob&s;tructed, we are a&s;&s;ured that &s;uch ob&s;truction proceeds not from his Maje&s;ty, the whole cour&s;e of who&s;e Government proclaims his Goode&s;s to his Subjects; neither have we any fear of your Excellencies perverting his Maje&s;ties In&s;tructions. We acknowledge you have well repre&s;ented his Maje&s;ties Clemency, and di&s;creetly managed the Prerogative, &amp; are truly &s;en&s;ible <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> our own happine&s;s under your Excellencies Government, of which we heartily wi&s;h the continuance.</P>
