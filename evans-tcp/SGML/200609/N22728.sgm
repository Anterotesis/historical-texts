<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lowing local piece (The Di&s;appointment, or, the Force of Credulity,) was originally written for the amu&s;e|ment of my&s;elf and a few of my particular friends, who were plea&s;ed to &s;ignify their approbation of it in &s;uch a manner, as to en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ro&s;s a con&s;iderable part of the conver&s;ation of all ranks of people, who expre&s;&s;ed their de&s;ire to &s;ee it and have it publi&s;h|ed.&mdash;Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, I was greatly at a lo&s;s how to proceed, (as I could di&s;cover little merit in it and never intended it for the pre&s;s) I was loth to expo&s;e it to the critici&s;ms of cri|tics in dramatic or &s;chola&s;tic knowledge, to ridicule my ignorance, or conde&s;cend to tho&s;e, who I thought were no better judges than my&s;elf, and who might, perhaps, out of compliment, or flattery to me, or to gratify their own de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">es, have repre&s;ented it in a more favourable light than it really de&s;erves.&mdash;Con&s;cious therefore of its in&s;ufficiency, I determined to excu&s;e my&s;elf to all, and in this determination per&s;i&s;ted for &s;ome time, till at length wearied out with fre&s;h and repeated &s;olicitations I was obliged to &s;urrender on the following &s;tipulations.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The infrequency of dramatic compo&s;itions in America.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The nece&s;&s;ity of contributing to the entertainment of the city.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. To put a &s;top (if po&s;&s;ible) to the fooli&s;h and pernicious practice of &s;earching after &s;uppo&s;ed hidden trea&s;ure.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Many people to this day, are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a fooli&s;h notion of the Pirates burying money along the river-&s;ide, and are &s;o infatuated with the hopes of obtaining it, that they neglect their bu&s;ine&s;s by day with the thoughts of it, by which means their families &s;uffer, and at night, like &s;o many m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;chievous mu&s;k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ats, &s;poil the meadows and banks to the very great injury of their re&s;pective owners.</NOTE></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The&s;e terms, I have with reluctance been forced to &s;ubmit for I am therefore obliged to a&s;&s;ure the public, that the &s;tory is founded on fact, tran&s;acted near this city not long &s;ince and re|cent in the memory of thou&s;ands, and for the truth of which I appeal to my fellow citizens.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="030036_0005_0FE40B48C0619860">But in order to give &s;trangers, and others unacquainted with the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ory, &s;ome idea of it, the following &s;hort hi&s;tory is thought nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The &s;cheme was planned by four humorous gentlemen, Hum, Parchment&punc; Quadrant, and Rattletrap, to divert them|&s;el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es, and friends and to try what lengths credulity and the love of money would carry me&punc;&mdash;</P>
<P>In order to put their &s;cheme in execution they framed a plau|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ble, well connected, &s;tory of hidden trea&s;ure, and to glo&s;s the matter, adapted &s;undry papers to their purpo&s;e and pitched upon two &s;uitable old fellows&punc; Wa&s;hball and Raccoon (as principal dupes, with others, who had all been at times on &s;eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">al digging ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur&s;ions) to try the &s;ucce&s;s of their &s;cheme, and put (if po&s;&s;ible) a final &s;top to &s;uch ridiculous practices in future, which had the de&s;ired effect. The moral &s;hews the folly of an over cre|dulity and de&s;ire of money, and how apt men are (e&s;pecially old men) to be unwarily drawn into &s;uch &s;chemes, where there is but a &s;hadow of gain, and concludes with love and virtue well rewarded, and the&s;e ob&s;ervations, that mankind ought to be con|tented with their re&s;pective &s;tations, to follow their different vocations with hone&s;ty and indu&s;try, the only &s;ure and reputable way to gain riches.</P>
<P>I do not figure to my&s;elf the lea&s;t advantage accruing from it but the &s;atisfaction of contributing my m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">te to &s;top the current of &s;uch folly.&mdash;Such as it is, I &s;ubmit to the public for their &s;anc|tion or condemnation, and &s;hould any merit appear in the per|formance, I &s;hall not vainly attribute it to my&s;elf, but place it to the credit of mere chance.</P>
