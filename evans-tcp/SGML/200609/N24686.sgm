<P>IT is a dangerous thing to meddle with a Metaphor. Much knowledge of crit|ici&s;m, and with writers on rhetoric, and much good reading, are requi&s;ite. A figure proves frequently too much for a young writer to cope with; and ought to be handled with cau|tion: hence &s;cribblers would not often cut &s;uch droll <HI>figures</HI> in their <HI>metaphors.</HI></P>

<P>WHEN we look over the works of the antient Ea&s;tern writers, we find a great &s;amene&s;s in authors who were unknown to each other. Virtues and vices, the pa&s;&s;ions and inclinations, were likened to objects that &s;urrounded, and to the various operations of nature. A man of integrity was like a <HI>rock</HI> in the &s;ea, unmoved with the <HI>waves</HI> of vice, or the <HI>&s;torms</HI> of adver&s;ity. Anger, like a <HI>whirlwind,</HI> de&s;troyed whatever oppo&s;ed its fury. An army <HI>poured</HI> like a torrent. The hor&s;emen <HI>flew</HI> over the plain. Love <HI>grew,</HI> Friend&s;hip <HI>died.</HI> And benevolence <HI>&s;cattered</HI> ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>NATURE pre&s;ents nearly the &s;ame ob|jects in all parts of the world: hence the compari&s;ons and figures of the fir&s;t rude writers of any country have &s;o much &s;im|ilarity. The Rhetoric of OSSIAN differs but little from that of the Per&s;ian po|ets, or the Jewi&s;h prophets. Much original|ity may be &s;een in all their writings. But
<PB N="7" REF="032708_0005_0FF42BC3F4725C70">
when writers multiplied, and Critici&s;m be|gan to enact her laws, impo&s;e her regulations, and &s;et bounds to the irregular &s;allies of imagination, originality of &s;entiment was in a great mea&s;ure wanting. The Poet read the Iliad; ob&s;erved what ARISTOTLE or LON|GINUS condemned, and imitated his beauties, but &s;carcely dared to wander from his path, le&s;t the Critic &s;hould cen&s;ure his deviations. Fancy, who, with plea&s;ure, before wantoned in the garden of rhetoric, collected her odoriferous flowers, or &s;trayed to neighbor|ing groves, or clumb the di&s;tant mount, to &s;can the beautiful and &s;ublime of nature, was now arre&s;ted in her career. Critici&s;m built her fences and made her enclo&s;ures, planted her vineyards and laid out her alleys; and ordered fancy never to tread prohibited grounds, nor wander from her &s;ight.</P>

<P>I HAVE often thought that the fear of appearing before the bar of critici&s;m, has been of e&s;&s;ential di&s;&s;ervice to a young genius. Tho
<PB N="8" REF="032708_0006_0FF43405A57927A8">
le&s;s correct, the lucubrations of a young writer di&s;play a noble wildne&s;s, and a plea&s;ing in|coherency. A &s;uperiority of fire and inven|tion, mark the works of all writers who were unacquainted with the laws of critici&s;m.</P>
<P>TO the cen&s;ures of the critic, I always op|po&s;e the authority of the poet. The world may con&s;ider it as a happine&s;s, that ADDISON and VOLTAIRE pa&s;t not their &s;trictures on MIL|TON and SHAKESPEARE, before their immortal works had gained univer&s;al applau&s;e. Sin and Death would have been &s;truck out from <HI>Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t,</HI> and the plays of SHAKESPEARE been &s;o mangled by the amendments of VOLTAIRE, that the Frenchified Bard of AVON would hardly have thanked the philo&s;opher of FERNEY, for his unde&s;erved kindne&s;s.</P>

<P>A BAD writer is always a bad critic. True Ta&s;te is as uncommon as an original writer. Some men po&s;&s;e&s;s good ta&s;te in &s;ome branches of literature, and are deficient in others. One judges well of
<PB N="9" REF="032708_0007_0FF43407CEECDCA0">
pro&s;aic compo&s;ition, on one &s;ubject, another on another. Few are capable of critici&s;ing accurately on all. He that is a great proficient in grammar determines the merit of a piece by the accuracy of the &s;pelling or the gram|mar. Another by the &s;tyle. One is plea&s;ed with the pathetic only, another with wit; one is delighted with &s;ublimity, and another with rural &s;implicity. The &s;ouls of but few are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with apartments for a compre|hen&s;ive &s;atisfaction in all. I know a man who reads POPE, but never perceives any thing plea&s;ing in MILTON. I know another who is plea&s;ed with all POPE's writings, who di&s;pi&s;es BUTLER's HUDIBRAS or TRUMBUL's M'FINGAL. This difference of &s;entiment ari&s;es wholly from a want of true Ta&s;te.</P>

and Pilgrim's Progre&s;s. A certain Ju&s;tice of Peace, who is ma&s;ter of the "Town Of|ficer," and has half a dozen old volumes in his library, is con&s;idered as an accurate judge of compo&s;ition. His word &s;anctions the worth of every performance, in the opinion of many. The fre&s;hman, who has ju&s;t gone thro VIRGIL, and has &s;een the works of the Engli&s;h poets, determines correctly the ex|act quantum of merit in each. When he arrives to his junior year, he either grows more mode&s;t, or becomes an arrant pedant. I have &s;een four or five di&s;cour&s;ing on Mr. PAINE's Prologue; the fine&s;t allegory in the Engli&s;h language (the allu&s;ion to the deluge) was condemned as non&s;en&s;ical and incorrect.

<P>MANY people imagine that Poetry con&s;i&s;ts entirely in a knack at rhyming; and on this pre&s;umption have often become, in their own opinions, poets of the fir&s;t rate. 'Tis difficult to give a true definition of this art. Its foundation is a lively imagination. An original manner of conception and ex|pre&s;&s;ion, a knowledge of grammar and metre, an intimate acquaintance with the pa&s;&s;ions and feelings, a correct judgment, long prac|tice, much reading, and above all a good nat|ural under&s;tanding, are e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary. Scribblers being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome, yet defic|ient in mo&s;t of the&s;e requi&s;ites, what time has been &s;pent, what paper has been wa&s;ted, what pains have been taken, for the obtain|ment of chagrin, di&s;appointment and ridi|cule, poverty and di&s;grace. Volumes have opened their eyes to infamy and clo&s;ed them in eternal oblivion. The world is &s;tocked with poetry, and poetry with non&s;en&s;e or plagiari&s;m.</P>

<P>SYLVIA is a lady of great delicacy. She once &s;aw a lou&s;e, and immediately faint|ed away. The &s;ight of a beggar turns her &s;tomach. If a man who&s;e rank is not equal to her own attempts to ki&s;s her, &s;he &s;creams and leaves the room. The mentioning of a wo|man's &s;hift is con&s;idered by her as an outrage on decency.</P>
<P>HER petticoat once got unpined at an a&s;&s;embly, and fell on the floor: had the heavens been cru&s;hing together, the con&s;tern|ation would not have been greater than that which was occa&s;ioned by this fatal cata&s;tro|phe, and the howlings of agony, that rent the bo&s;om of affected delicacy.</P>

<P>BUT SYLVIA's real mode&s;ty was finally determined to the &s;atisfaction of all. Her lap dog was paying his addre&s;&s;es to a lady of the &s;ame &s;pecies; and, (mirabile dictu,) SYLVIA was &s;een peaking thro a broken pane of gla&s;s to ob&s;erve their conduct.</P>

<P>MUSIC, whether con&s;idered as a &s;ource of plea&s;ure and rational entertainment, or as an ennobling duty in religious &s;ocieties, may with propriety be denominated the &s;weete&s;t ro&s;e in the garden of the polite arts.

<P>EXCELLENCY in mu&s;ic depends on the

natural delicacy and conformity of the or|gans. The &s;ame may be &s;aid with regard to a nice and intimate knowledge of accent, quantity and harmony, in poetic num|bers.</P>
<P>As eminence in the&s;e arts depends pri|marily on nature, and &s;econdly on a &s;uitable cultivation of original powers, it has been the lot of but a proportionably &s;mall part of man|kind to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves very greatly in the world. Hence many a HANDEL never touched an organ; and many a MIL|TON never learned to read.</P>
<P>Though few per&s;ons ever become nice and accurate judges of mu&s;ic, yet the plea&s;|ure derived from it is almo&s;t univer&s;al. There are however &s;ome, who&s;e &s;ouls &s;eem to har|monize with nothing but di&s;cord, who re|ceive not the lea&s;t &s;atisfaction from the be&s;t mu&s;ical performances in the world: but we may &s;ay with Shake&s;peare.</P>

The ruder principles of mu&s;ic are found in many of the brutal and inferior parts of creation. The feathered &s;ong&s;ters, while &s;porting from &s;pray to &s;pray, chant forth their Maker's prai&s;e. The readbrea&s;t mourns in &s;olitary &s;trains her ab&s;ent mate: or when &s;ome un|lucky boy has robbed her ne&s;t, and from her love and protection torn her tender young; &s;he flutters round; and in the mu&s;ical moan of grief and de&s;pair, cur&s;es the wretch, and bids and begs the pilfering hand to &s;pare her unfledged offspring.

In many places, &s;ome elderly people, who, when young&punc; had attended to &s;ome particular tunes, once much in vogue, for which they &s;till re|tain a &s;uper&s;titious fondne&s;s, continue to prai&s;e the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, in &s;trains of <HI>na&s;al twang,</HI> offen&s;ive to the ears of common delicacy.

to attend. The tunes they u&s;e are the &s;ame their good old grandmothers &s;ung in their youth; and thus, having gained a kind of hereditary approbation, &s;till &s;tand high in their opinion. Thus the ver&s;ification of the p&s;alms by Sternhold and Hopkins, as they were a long time printed at the end of the bible, led many to believe that the very rhymes were indited by in&s;piration. Hence it was with the greate&s;t difficulty that the fooli&s;h prejudice of many could be &s;o far overcome, as to introduce in our churches the far &s;upe|rior ver&s;ification of Tate and Brady, or Watts. And, not many years &s;ince, the introduction of the pitchpipe, and the rai&s;ing and falling of the hands for the pre&s;ervation of time, were by many con&s;idered as u&s;ele&s;s and unhappy ceremonies, tending in a great mea&s;ure to in|troduce Popery among us.</P>
<P>INSTRUMENTAL mu&s;ic is certainly a great addition to vocal, and has the happie&s;t effect upon it. Yet there are &s;ome, even to this day, who are unwilling to admit into public wor&s;hip the ba&s;s viol, which adds &s;o much &s;o|lemnity to vocal mu&s;ic. The rea&s;on prof|fered

by &s;ome is, that the ba&s;s viol looks &s;o much like the common violin, and the common violin is commonly called a fiddle, and a fid|dle is commonly made u&s;e of to a&s;&s;i&s;t in danc|ing; therefore, the ba&s;s viol in religions &s;oci|eties would be apt to make the young men and women think of a fiddle, and a fiddle would lead to dancing: and thus carry their thoughts from religious meditations to danc|ing, fiddling, and other worldly and un&s;uita|ble contemplations. For which rea&s;ons the ba&s;s viol is by them inadmi&s;&s;ible.

<Q>"Know thine own &s;elf."</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS was the precept of a certain Greek Philo&s;opher, enforced by POPE and MASON, and acknowledged by all men to be both u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>IT is the fir&s;t "thing needful" to know one's &s;elf, but it is almo&s;t equally important for worldly happine&s;s, to know other men.</P>
<P>SOME preach up the propriety of mind|ing our own bu&s;ine&s;s, and not concerning our&s;elves in the affairs of others. This doc|trine is not totally good. The characters of all men ought to be open to inve&s;tigation: and cen&s;ure, when ju&s;t, ought never to be withheld. Even the name of WASHING|TON is not &s;acred, and never ought to be: yet the ungrounded, malicious calumnies that have been uttered again&s;t him have made
<PB N="64" REF="032708_0062_0FF434AEE455A6A8">
more bright his reputation; for how has the gold become the mo&s;t fine gold!</P>
<P>THE characters of men, after their de|cea&s;e, are never beyond the &s;crutiny of truth. The old adage. <HI>Nil de mortuis ni&s;i bonum,</HI> 'Say nothing of the dead except in their favor,' is wholly unrea&s;onable. What &s;hall the hone&s;t hi&s;torion &s;ay of NERO? He mu&s;t pa&s;s over him in &s;ilence; for not one good deed ever recommended him to notice.</P>
<P>LET us be careful never to condemn, or &s;peak evil of men, without convincing proofs of their neglect of duty. Every man has faults enough of his own to mend, and ought ever be ready to hear and correct them.</P>

<P>SHE received from nature an excellent di&s;po&s;ition of mind, as well as great &s;trength and &s;tability of &s;oul. Tho &s;he was never in|&s;tructed in the precepts of any religion, &s;he

<P>SHE was not addicted to drink, except on warm days after much labor and fatigue. During her whole life 'tis not known that &s;he acquired a &s;ingle bad habit.
