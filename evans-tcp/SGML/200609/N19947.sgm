<P>THE YORKER'S STRATAGEM; OR BANANA'S WEDDING. A FARCE, IN TWO ACTS. AS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE IN NEW-YORK, BY THE Old American Company of Comedians, WITH UNIVERSAL APPLAUSE.</P>

<HEAD>TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of the following little Piece is &s;en&s;ible of its numerous defects&mdash;it was got up in a hurry, and under many di&s;advanta|ges. The very flattering marks of approbation, however, with which it was received, together with the pre&s;&s;ing importunities of many friends, have led him to &s;uppo&s;e that a publication of it would not be unplea&s;ing.</P>
<P>To the generous Patrons of the Drama, and to the worthy Sons of Columbia who feel an in|tere&s;t in the welfare of the American Stage, the <HI>YORKER'S STRATAGEM</HI> is mo&s;t re&s;pectfully de|dicated: and the Author is not without hopes, that this feeble attempt, defective as it is, will meet an apology from every generous heart for its introduction into the world.</P>

<P>WELL, Captain, here are we arrived in the We&s;t-Indies, the climate for life, luxury and fa&s;hion; do you not think I have cho&s;e a pretty fancy dre&s;s to come a&s;hore in?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Captain.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why truly, Sir, there are two things which appear very odd to me, and which I own give ri&s;e to &s;trange conjectures.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>What are they?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Captain.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, why you &s;hould prefer this out-bay, where there are but a few fi&s;hing-huts and two or three &s;tores, to your chance of a market at the princi|pal town; and &s;econdly, your coming a&s;hore in this di&s;|gui&s;e has &s;omething tha appearance of a &s;py.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, my dear fellow, to clear your &s;u&s;picions I will fully acquaint you with my de&s;ign in coming here, and the &s;tory that gave ri&s;e to it&mdash;It is almo&s;t need|le&s;s for me to reque&s;t your &s;ecrecy and a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>

<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>In our conver&s;ations about the fair &s;ex, you have frequently heard me dwell with rapture on the vir|tues and beauty of a young lady with whom I got ac|quainted when &s;he was at a boarding-&s;chool in York.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Captain.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have, Sir, and wi&s;h'd to a&s;k you particu|larly about her, but was afraid it might offend.</P>

<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>Her name is Sophia Bellange, a native of this country; her parents are lately dead. 'Tis a letter from her &s;ince her arrival here that was the cau&s;e of my clo&s;|ing my affairs at home, and undertaking this journey. She de&s;cribes her guardian to be avaricious, and totally de&s;titute of principle, con&s;tantly employed in every war|rantable theft that the &s;implicity or imprudence of his neighbours will permit him to practi&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Captain.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, how do you intend to meet him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Amant.</SPEAKER>
<P>With his own weapons, artifice and chicane. You mu&s;t introduce me as &s;upercargo, a true Yankey, &s;ent out by daddy with a cargo of lumber, hogs and poultry, to make daddy's own &s;on a '&s;quire. My ap|parent &s;implicity will en&s;ure him a gull, and me an op|portunity of &s;eeing my mi&s;tre&s;s, and contriving &s;ome means to get her and her fortune out of his hands.</P>

<P>You mu&s;t &s;ay as little as po&s;&s;ible, appear al|mo&s;t as ignorant as my&s;elf, and depend on me for in|&s;tructions as we go on. Suppo&s;e we call in the landlord and make &s;ome enquiry about the old gentleman?</P>
