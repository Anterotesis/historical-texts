<P>Very well; it is prudently done! When I was married, my late husband and I were very poor, indeed; and when my Robert, your husband, was born I put myself to many, many, little inconveniencies, that my child might want nothing. Now, it is your turn to make these sacrifices. When children are small, the mother should forego many of her wishes, to provide for their wants.</P>

<P>Do not take this amiss, daughter; but, I must say, that, for some time past, great disorder has prevailed in this house. Something or other is always wanting. I am blind; I cannot see&mdash;'tis true. Yet I can discern more than gives me pleasure.</P>

<P>His property was great: and though a part be lost, his mother's breakfast should not be wanting. I know my son: he will never forget, that, at the risk of my health <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> supplied him myself with his first food. I was then sickly; yet I had no wet nurse for him. And I am confident, he would rather deprive himself of some|thing, than suffer his old blind mother to want.</P>

<P>No, dear good mother, never!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, I had been better satisfied, had you possessed some fortune; but then I always said to myself, love goes a great way. My late husband, poor man, at first, had no property, nor had I; but we were very hap|py. My son is a rich man, through our industry: for God's sake! let him chuse as his heart directs! if the young woman is poor, she will be grateful, and the more readily nurse me when I am old. I want but little; but that lit|tle I ought not to be at the trouble of asking for. She will always have it ready, before I open my lips.</P>

<P>Aye, daughter, it has been&mdash;<HI>it has been</HI>&mdash;but it is no more. Every thing has of late taken a most singu|lar turn, and grows worse daily. Old people are a little difficult, and are fond of order. What to young people seems the effect of caprice, often is indispensably neces|sary to the old. The variety of youthful enjoyments is so great, that some may well be spared: but old age is confined to so few enjoyments, that it can ill afford to lose any. And yet, daughter,
<STAGE>(with a tone of increasing animation)</STAGE>
I will rather suffer want myself, than that my poor little grandson be neglected: this goes to my very soul! You are his mother: You may love him dearly, very dearly indeed! but I am his grandmother, and love him still more.

<P>O God! thou openest to me, a path of escape out of this maze of suffering&mdash;but, a path I cannot tread!&mdash;Leave Arabella!&mdash;Leave my mother, aged and blind!&mdash;No:&mdash;Never!
<STAGE>(<HI>He walks about wildly</HI>)</STAGE>
Are there no other means? Cannot I take a brush, and pre|sent myself to clean people's shoes, as they pass? No honest shift that will supply bread to my family, can be disgraceful.
<STAGE>(Pauses)</STAGE>
Or, shall I follow the gambler, and make myself his accomplice in robbery? Would it be an unpardonable crime, to commit an act of rob|bery&mdash;but <HI>for once</HI> in my life?&mdash;And this, to prevent all that is dear to me, from perishing for hunger?&mdash;No, Maxwell! think of the noble soul of thy wife! Do not wound her heart with worse than the pangs of death.
<STAGE>(<HI>Pauses again</HI>)</STAGE>
That gentleman was in the right: better, better far, to leave wife and child, than by my presence, to enhance their sufferings. Must <HI>they</HI> not live without <HI>me,</HI> because <HI>I</HI> cannot live without <HI>them?</HI> I will be gone: I will go to India. Fool! Will that give them bread? Oh! could I, but by any honest means, secure to them subsistence; I would set off for India, this moment. They might weep for my absence. But, if they had only bread to eat; what, though they should moisten it with their tears?
<STAGE>(<HI>Again a pause</HI>)</STAGE>
O God! thou who feedest the fowls of the air, who clothest the callow young in the nest!&mdash;pour but one ray of cheering light into my soul! Shew me only a protector for my wife!
<STAGE>(<HI>He gazes wildly around him</HI>)</STAGE>
Faces, every where,&mdash; human faces but, no men&mdash;no humanity!

Ah! there! Walwyn comes.

Walwyn!

the saviour of my wife. Stay! Let me accustom myself to thy view!
<STAGE>(pauses)</STAGE>
Well, and what matters it? Thou goest to India&mdash;art dead to Arabella&mdash;but, wilt live in her remembrance, while Harry lives&mdash;Thy blind and aged mother is provided for&mdash;Happy!
<STAGE>(<HI>deeply affected</HI>)</STAGE>
happy! Why not? Is she to be miserable, because I am so? Dost thou love her as dearly as she deserves?
<STAGE>(<HI>with mild dignity</HI>)</STAGE>
Well, then, true love is capable of sacrificing even itself.
<STAGE>(<HI>pauses</HI>)</STAGE>
No, it is not any malignant influence, imposing on my disordered fancy! This is the path which fate points out&mdash;the only one. No tenderness for my own feelings, shall draw me back.

My Arabella loved you&mdash; To assist us, would give you a degree of merit, in the eyes of my wife, which I could not patiently think of. Could I look upon her without shame and anguish, while her conscious looks might seem to tell me&mdash;that we were supported by the bounty of him, who was once, my rival in her love?

<P>Maxwell, drive all such thoughts from your mind. Your misfortunes have disordered your imagination. What are a thousand pounds to me? Besides, it is but a loan.

<P>Holding your hand, I swore eternal fidelity to my husband. I, too, have kept my oath. I do not say I have found the task a hard one; No: I have found it easy; for, I possess a worthy man. For the first year, I might devote many a secret tear to the remembrance of the sweet dreams of younger years; yet these have been long assuaged by the new feelings of a mother's fondness.&mdash;Maxwell's wild fancy of this day, might perhaps have been to me less extravagant, <HI>before I was a mother.</HI> A childless pair might dare to part! But, now, Walwyn, now, no power on earth can break asun|der the bonds of my duty,&mdash;No, not the power of love itself.</P>

<SPEAKER>Wal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not interrupted you: for, where I love, I delight to admire. The word escaped; but it came from the heart of a man who knows no wish of which

he can need to be ashamed. Arabella misunderstood me. I listened to your husband, merely to gain time, to sooth the fever of his soul, to save him from the wild phrenzy of despair. His sufferings have awakened within him, powers hitherto unknown to himself, of which the new-born consciousness is pleasing. <HI>To sacrifice himself for his wife</HI>&mdash;is the splendid idea, on which he, at present, delights to gaze till his mind's eye becomes blind to every ray of other hope.&mdash;It is for this, that his pride devises so many refined pretensions for refusing the assitance of a friend. These would he scarce resign for the sake of the salvation of his family and himself; for resigning these,&mdash;he would lose the idol of his fancy, created by love, nutured by want and despair, raised by disordered nerves to be the tyrant of his soul.&mdash;He must be gently and softly led back from the precipice to which he is hurried. As to the night-walker,&mdash;we must not call him by his name, but, in silence stretch out our arms, that if he fall, he may sink on the bosom of a friend!</P>

<P>Wealth could not corrupt a heart sacred to you, I came to concert with you, the means of saving Maxwell. without suffering it to appear the work of my hand.
