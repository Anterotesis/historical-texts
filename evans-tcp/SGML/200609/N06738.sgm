<HEAD>A NARRATIVE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS I am but a Youth, I &s;hall not make tho&s;e Remarks on the Diffi|culties I have met with, or the kind Ap|pearances of a good GOD for my Pre&s;er|vation, as one of riper Years might do; but &s;hall leave that to the Reader as he goes along, and &s;hall only beg his Prayers, that Mercies and Afflictions may be &s;ancti|fied to me, and relate Matters of Fact as they occur to my Mind.&mdash;</P>
<P>I was born in <HI>Charle&s;town,</HI> near <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> in the Year 1740, and put an Apprentice by my Father to Mr. <HI>Mark White</HI> of <HI>Acton,</HI> and in the Year 1756, in the Month of <HI>May,</HI> I inli&s;ted into Major <HI>Rogers</HI>'s Corps of Rangers, in the Company commanded by Capt. <HI>Spike|man.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>We march'd for <HI>Albany,</HI> where we ar|riv'd the fir&s;t of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Fort-Edward.</HI> I was out on &s;everal Scouts, in one of which I kill'd an <HI>Indian.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="008557_0003_102F8467DBF7D210">On the 18th of <HI>Jan.</HI> 1757, we march'd on a Scout from Fort <HI>William-Henry</HI>; Major <HI>Rogers</HI> him&s;elf headed us: All were Voluntiers that went on this Scout.&mdash; We came to the Road leading from <HI>Tion|deroga</HI> to <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> and on Lake <HI>Cham|plain</HI> (which was froze over) we &s;aw a|bout 50 Sleys; the Major thought proper to attack them and ordered us all, about 60 in Number, to lay in Ambu&s;h, and when they were near enough we were order'd to pur&s;ue them. I happened to be near the Major when he took the fir&s;t Pri&s;oner, a <HI>Frenchman:</HI> I &s;ingled out one and follow'd him; they fled &s;ome one Way and &s;ome another, but I &s;oon came up with him and took him. We took &s;even in all, the re&s;t e&s;caping, &s;ome to <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> and &s;ome return'd to <HI>Tionderoga:</HI> When we had brought the Pri&s;oners to Land the Major examined them, and they inform'd him that there were 35 <HI>Indians</HI> and 500 Regulars at <HI>Tionderoga.</HI></P>
<P>It being a rainy Day we made a Fire and dry'd our Guns.</P>
<P>The Major tho't be&s;t to return to Fort <HI>William-Henry</HI> in the &s;ame Path we came, the Snow being very deep; we march'd
<PB N="5" REF="008557_0004_102F846BA4784208">
in an Indian-File and kept the Pri&s;oners in the Rear, le&s;t we &s;hould be attack'd: We proceeded in this Order about a Mile and an half, and as we were a&s;cending a Hill, and the Centre of our Men were at the Top, the <HI>French,</HI> to the Number of 400, be&s;ides 30 or 40 <HI>Indians,</HI> fir'd on us before we di&s;covered them: The Major ordered us to advance. I receiv'd a Wound from the Enemy (the fir&s;t Shot they made on us) thro' the Body, upon which I re|tir'd into the Rear, to the Pri&s;oner I had taken on the Lake, knock'd him on the Head and kill'd him, le&s;t he &s;hould e&s;cape and give bad Information to the Enemy; and as I was going to place my&s;elf behind a large Rock, there &s;tarted up an <HI>Indian</HI> from the other Side; I threw my|&s;elf backwards into the Snow, and it being very deep, &s;unk &s;o low that I broke my Snow-&s;hoes (I had Time to pull 'em off, but was obliged to let my Shoes go with them) one <HI>Indian</HI> threw his Tomahawk at me, and another was ju&s;t upon &s;eizing me; but I happily e&s;caped and got to the Centre of our Men, and fix'd my&s;elf be|hind a large Pine, where I loaded and fir'd every Opportunity; after I had di&s;charged

6 or 7 Times, there came a Ball and cut off my Gun ju&s;t at the Lock. About half an Hour after, I receiv'd a Shot in my Knee; I crawled again into the Rear, and as I was turning about receiv'd a Shot in my Shoulder. The Engagement held, as near as I could gue&s;s, 5 &frac12; Hours, and as I learnt after I was taken, we killed more of the Enemy than we were in Number. &mdash;By this Time it grew dark and the Fir|ing cea&s;ed on both Sides, and as we were &s;o few the Major took the Advantage of the Night and e&s;caped with the well Men, without informing the wounded of his De&s;ign, le&s;t they &s;hould inform the Ene|my and they &s;hould pur&s;ue him before he had got out of their Reach.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Spikeman,</HI> one <HI>Baker</HI> and my&s;elf, all very badly wounded, made a &s;mall Fire and &s;at about half an Hour, when looking round we could not &s;ee any of our Men; Captain <HI>Spikeman</HI> called to Major <HI>Rogers,</HI> but received no An&s;wer, except from the Enemy at &s;ome Di&s;tance; upon this we concluded our People were fled. All hope of E&s;cape now vani&s;h'd; we were &s;o wounded that we could not travel; I could but ju&s;t walk the others could &s;carce
<PB N="7" REF="008557_0006_102F846F948C2D78">
move; we therefore concluded to &s;urren|der our&s;elves to the <HI>French:</HI> Ju&s;t as we came to this Conclu&s;ion, I &s;aw an <HI>Indian</HI> coming towards us over a &s;mall Rivulet that parted us in the Engagement: I crawl'd &s;o far from the Fire that I could not be &s;een, though I could &s;ee what was acted at the Fire; the <HI>Indian</HI> came to Capt. <HI>Spikeman,</HI> who was not able to re&s;i&s;t, and &s;tripp'd and &s;calp'd him alive; <HI>Baker,</HI> who was lying by the Captain, pull'd out his Knife to &s;tab him&s;elf, which the <HI>In|dian</HI> prevented and carried him away: Seeing this dreadful Tragedy, I concluded, if po&s;&s;ible, to crawl into the Woods and there die of my Wounds&punc; But not being far from Capt. <HI>Spikeman,</HI> he &s;aw me and beg'd me <HI>for God's &s;ake! to give him a Tomahawk, that he might put an End to his Life!</HI> I refus'd him, and exhorted him as well as I could to pray for Mercy, as he could not live many Minutes in that deplorable Condition, being on the frozen Ground, cover'd with Snow. He de&s;ired me to let his Wife know (if I lived to get home) the dreadful Death he died. As I was travelling as well as I could, or ra|ther creeping along, I found one of our
<PB N="8" REF="008557_0007_102F847128235078">
People dead; I pull'd off his Stockings (he had no Shoes) and put them on my own Legs.</P>
<P>By this Time the Body of the Enemy had made a Fire, and had a large Number of Centries out on our Path, &s;o that I was obliged to creep quite round them before I could get into the Path; but ju&s;t before I came to it I &s;aw a <HI>Frenchman</HI> behind a Tree, within two Rods of me, but the Fire &s;hining right on him prevented his &s;eeing me. They cried out about every Quarter of an Hour, in <HI>French,</HI> ALL IS WELL! And while he that was &s;o near me was &s;peaking, I took the Opportunity to creep away, that he might not hear me, and by this Means got clear of him and got into our Path. But the Snow and Cold put my Feet into &s;uch Pain, as I had no Shoes, that I could not go on; I there|fore &s;at down by a Brook, and wrapt my Feet in my Blanket. But my Body being cold by &s;itting &s;till, I got up, and crawl'd along in this mi&s;erable Condition the Re|mainder of the Night.</P>
<P>The next Day, about 11 o'Clock, I heard the Shouts of <HI>Indians</HI> behind me, and I &s;uppos'd they &s;aw me; within a few Mi|nutes
<PB N="9" REF="008557_0008_102F8476E7439708">
four came down a Mountain, run|ing towards me: I threw off my Blanket, and Fear and Dread quickned my Pace for a while; but, by Rea&s;on of the Lo&s;s of &s;o much Blood from my Wounds, I &s;oon fail'd. When they were within a few Rods of me they cock'd their Guns, and told me to &s;top; but I refus'd, hoping they would fire and kill me on the Spot; which I cho&s;e, rather than the dreadful Death Capt. <HI>Spikeman</HI> died of. They &s;oon came up with me, took me by the Neck and ki&s;s'd me. On &s;earching my Pockets they found &s;ome Money, which they were &s;o fond of, that in trying who could get mo&s;t they had like to have kill'd me. They took &s;ome dry Leaves and put them into my Wounds, and then turn'd about and ordered me to follow them.</P>
<P>When we came near the main Body of the Enemy, the <HI>Indians</HI> made a Live-Shout, as they call it when they bring in a Pri&s;oner alive (different from the Shout they make when they bring in Scalps, which they call a Dead-Shout.) The <HI>In|dians</HI> ran to meet us, and one of them &s;truck me with a Cutla&s;s a-cro&s;s the Side; he cut thro' my Cloaths, but did not touch
<PB N="10" REF="008557_0009_102F847A2EC3C188">
my Fle&s;h; others ran again&s;t me with their Heads: I a&s;k'd if there was no In|terpreter, upon which a <HI>Frenchman</HI> cry'd, <HI>I am one:</HI> I ask'd him, if this was the Way they treated their Pri&s;oners, to let them be cut and beat to Pieces by the <HI>In|dians?</HI> He de&s;ired me to come to him; but the <HI>Indians</HI> would not let me, holding me one by one Arm and another by the other: But there ari&s;ing a Difference be|tween the four <HI>Indians</HI> that took me, they fell to fighting, which their commanding Officer &s;eeing, he came and took me away and carry'd me to the Interpreter; who drew his Sword, and pointing it to my Brea&s;t, charged me to tell the Truth, or he would run me through: He then a&s;k'd me what Number our Scout con&s;i&s;ted of? I told him 50: He a&s;ked me where they were gone? I told him, I &s;uppo&s;ed as they were &s;o numerous they could be&s;t tell. He &s;aid I told him wrong; for he knew of more than 100 that were &s;lain: I told him we had lo&s;t but 19 in all: He &s;aid, there were as many Officers. On which he led me to Lieut. <HI>Kennedy.</HI> I &s;aw he was much tomhawk'd by the <HI>In|dians.</HI> He a&s;k'd me if he was an Officer?
<PB N="11" REF="008557_0010_102F847BCA3309C8">
I told him, he was a Lieutenant: And then he took me to another; who, I told him, was an En&s;ign: From thence he carried me to Captain <HI>Spikeman,</HI> who was laying in the Place I left him; they had cut off his Head, and fix'd it on a Pole.</P>
<P>I beg'd for a Pair of Shoes, and &s;ome|thing to eat; the Interpreter told me, I &s;hould have Relief when I came to <HI>Tion|deroga,</HI> which was but one Mile and a &frac14; off, and then delivered me to the 4 <HI>Indians</HI> that took me. The <HI>Indians</HI> gave me a Piece of Bread, and put a pair of Shoes on my Feet.</P>
<P>About this Time <HI>Robert Baker,</HI> men|tioned above, was brought where I was; we were extremely glad to &s;ee each other, tho' we were in &s;uch a di&s;tre&s;s'd Condition: he told me of five Men that were taken. We were ordered to march on towards <HI>Tionderoga:</HI> But <HI>Baker</HI> replied, he could not walk. An <HI>Indian</HI> then pu&s;hed him forwards; but he could not go, and there|fore &s;at down and cried; whereupon an <HI>Indian</HI> took him by the Hair, and was go|ing to kill him with his Tomhawk: I was moved with Pity for him, and, as weak as I was, I took his Arms over my
<PB N="12" REF="008557_0011_102F847E9BFD9E70">
Shoulders, and was enabled to get him to the Fort.</P>
<P>We were immediately &s;ent to the Guard Hou&s;e, and, about half an Hour after, brought before the Commanding-Officer, who, by his Interpreter, examined us &s;e|parately; after which he again &s;ent us to the Guard-Hou&s;e. The Interpreter came and told us, <HI>that we were to be hang'd the next Day, becau&s;e we had kill'd the</HI> 7 <HI>Pri&s;oners we had taken on the Lake</HI>; but was afterwards &s;o kind as to tell us, this was done only to terrify us. About an Hour after came a Doctor, and his Mate, and dre&s;&s;ed our Wounds; and the Com|manding-Officer &s;ent us a Quart of Claret. We lay all Night on the Boards, without Blankets. The next Day I was put into the Ho&s;pital, (the other Pri&s;oners were carried another Way) here I tarried 'till the 19th of <HI>Feb.</HI> and the <HI>Indians</HI> in&s;i&s;ted on having me, to carry to their Homes, and broke into the Ho&s;pital; but the Cen|tinel call'd the Guard and turn'd them out; after which, the commanding Offi|cer prevailed with them to let me &s;tay 'till the 1&s;t of <HI>March,</HI> by which Time I was able to walk about the Fort.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="008557_0012_102F84831B716BD0">As I was one Day in the Interpreter's Lodging, there came in 10 or 12 <HI>Indians,</HI> with the Scalps they had taken, in order to have a War-Dance: They &s;et me on the Floor, and put 7 of the Scalps on my Head while they danc'd; when it was over, they lifted me up in triumph: But as I went and &s;tood by the Door, two <HI>In|dians</HI> began to dance a Live-Dance, and one of them threw a Tomhawk at me, to kill me, but I watch'd his Motion and dodg'd the Weapon.</P>
<P>I lived with the Interpreter 'till the fir&s;t of <HI>March,</HI> when General <HI>Rigeau</HI> came to the Fort with about 9000 Men, in order, as they &s;aid, to make an Attempt on Fort <HI>William-Henry:</HI> Their De&s;ign was to &s;cale the Walls; for which Purpo&s;e I &s;aw them making Scaling-Ladders.&mdash;The Day be|fore they marched the General &s;ent for me, and &s;aid, <HI>Young Man you are a likely Fellow; it's Pity you &s;hould live with &s;uch an ignorant People as the</HI> Engli&s;h, <HI>you had better live with me.</HI> I told him I was willing to live with him: He an&s;wer'd, <HI>I &s;hould, and go with him where he went:</HI> I replied, Perhaps he would have me go to War with him: He &s;aid, <HI>That was the
<PB N="14" REF="008557_0013_102F84862F7E14C0">
Thing; he wanted me to direct him to Fort</HI> William-Henry, <HI>and &s;how him where he might &s;cale the Walls.</HI> I told him, I was &s;orry that a Gentleman &s;hould de&s;ire &s;uch a Thing of a Youth, or endeavour to draw him away from his Duty.&mdash;He added, <HI>He would give me</HI> 7000 <HI>Livres on his Return.</HI> I replied, that I was not to be bought with Money, to be a Traitor to my Coun|try and a&s;&s;i&s;t in de&s;troying my Friends: He &s;miled, and &s;aid, <HI>In War you mu&s;t not mind even Father or Mother.</HI>&mdash;When he found that he could not prevail with me, by all the fair Promi&s;es he made, he or|dered me back to the Fort; and had two other Pri&s;oners brought before him, to whom he made the &s;ame Propo&s;als as he had made to me; to which they con&s;ent|ed. The next Day I went into the Room where they were, and a&s;ked them if they had been with the General; they &s;aid, they had, and that they were to have 7000 Livres a-piece, as a Reward: I a&s;k'd them, if that was the Value of their Fa|thers and Mothers, and of their Country? They &s;aid they were obliged to go. I &s;aid, the General could not force them; and added, that if they went on &s;uch a De|&s;ign,
<PB N="15" REF="008557_0014_102F8487C78BCEF8">
they mu&s;t never return among their Friends; for if they did, and <HI>Baker</HI> and I &s;hould live to get Home, we would en|deavour they &s;hould be hang'd. At this Time a Smith came and put Irons on my Feet: But the General gave tho&s;e two Men who promis'd to go with him, a Blanket, a Pair of Stockings and Shoes. They were taken out of the Guard-Hou&s;e, and marched with the <HI>French</HI> as Pilots.&mdash;The General did not &s;ucceed; he only burnt our Battoes, &amp;c. and returned to <HI>Tionder|oga.</HI>&mdash;The poor Fellows never had their Reward, but, in&s;tead of that, were &s;ent to the Guard-Hou&s;e and put in Irons.</P>
<P>Soon after this I was taken out of Irons, and went to live with the Interpreter 'till the 27th of <HI>March</HI>; at which Time the <HI>Indians</HI> took me with them, in order to go to <HI>Montreal,</HI> and &s;et me to draw a large Sled, with Provi&s;ions, my Arms being tied with a Rope. By the Time we got to <HI>Crown-Point, I</HI> was &s;o lame that I could not walk. The <HI>Indians</HI> went a&s;hore and built a Fire, and then told me <HI>I</HI> mu&s;t dance: to which <HI>I</HI> complied, rather than be kill'd. When we &s;at off again, <HI>I</HI> knew not how to get rid of my Sled, and <HI>I</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="008557_0015_102F84895D1D4328">
knew <HI>I</HI> was not able to draw it; but this Fancy came into my Head; <HI>I</HI> took three Squaws on my Sled, and plea&s;antly told them, <HI>I wi&s;h'd I was able to draw 'em:</HI> All this took with the <HI>Indians</HI>; they freed me of the Sled, and gave it to other Pri|&s;oners: They &s;tripp'd off all my Cloaths, and gave me a Blanket. And the next Morning, they cut off my Hair and paint|ed me, and, with Needles and <HI>Indian</HI>-ink, prick'd on the back of my Hand the Form of one of the Scaling-Ladders, which the <HI>French</HI> made to carry to Fort <HI>William-Henry.</HI> I under&s;tood they were vex'd at the <HI>French,</HI> for the Di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>We travelled about nine Miles on Lake <HI>Champlain,</HI> and when the Sun was two Hours high we &s;top'd; they made a Fire, and took one of the Pri&s;oners that had not been wounded, and were going to cut off his Hair, as they had done mine: He fooli&s;hly re&s;i&s;ted them, upon which they prepar'd to burn him; but the Com|manding-Officer prevented it at this Time. But the next Night, they made a Fire, &s;tripp'd and ty'd him to a Stake, and the Squaws cut Pieces of Pine, like Scures, and thru&s;t them into his Fle&s;h, and &s;et
<PB N="17" REF="008557_0016_102F848FF08E4470">
them on Fire, and then fell to powwaw|ing and dancing round him; and ordered me to do the &s;ame: Love of Life obliged me to comply; for I could expect no bet|ter Treatment if I refus'd. With a bitter and heavy Heart I feigned my&s;elf merry. They cut the poor Man's Cords, and made him run backwards and forwards. I heard the poor Man's Cries to Heaven for Mer|cy; and at length, thro' extreme Angui&s;h and Pain, he pitched him&s;elf into the Flames and expired.</P>
<P>From thence we travelled, without any Thing worthy of Notice happening, 'till we came to an <HI>Indian</HI> Town, about 20 Miles from <HI>Montreal.</HI>&mdash;When we were about a Gun's-&s;hot from the Town, the <HI>Indians</HI> made as many live Shouts as they had Pri&s;oners, and as many dead Ones as they had Scalps. The Men and Women came out to meet us, and &s;tripp'd me na|ked; after which they pointed to a Wig|wam, and told me to run to it, pur&s;uing me all the Way with Sticks and Stones.</P>
<P>Next Day we went to <HI>Montreal,</HI> where I was carried before Governor <HI>Vaudreuill</HI> and examined: Afterwards I was taken into a <HI>French</HI> Merchant's Hou&s;e, and there
<PB N="18" REF="008557_0017_102F849202644248">
I lived three Days. The third Night two of the <HI>Indians</HI> that took me came in drunk, and a&s;ked for me; upon which the Lady called me into the Room, and as I went and &s;tood by the Door, one of them began to dance the War-Dance about me, de|&s;igning to kill me; but as he lifted up his Hand to &s;tab me, I catch'd hold of it with one of mine, and with the other knock'd him down, and then ran up Garret and hid.&mdash;The Lady &s;ent for &s;ome Neighbours to clear the Hou&s;e of her Gue&s;ts, which they did: It was a very cold Night, and one of the <HI>Indians</HI> being exce&s;&s;ive drunk, fell down near the Hou&s;e, and was found in the Morning froze to Death. The <HI>In|dians</HI> came to the Hou&s;e, and finding their Brother dead, &s;aid I had kill'd him; and gathering a Number together, with their Guns, be&s;et the Hou&s;e and demanded me of the Lady, &s;aying, I &s;hould die the mo&s;t cruel Death: The Lady told me of it, and advis'd me to hide my&s;elf in the Cellar, under the Pipes of Wine; which I did&punc; They &s;earched the Hou&s;e, and even came down Cellar, but could not find me. The Lady de&s;ired a <HI>Frenchman</HI> to tell the <HI>Indians, That he &s;aw me without the City

running away</HI>; they &s;oon took after me, every Way.&mdash;The Merchant pitying my Condition, cover'd me with a Blanket, and carried me in his Conveyance about five Miles, to a Village where his Wife's Fa|ther lived, in order to keep me out of the Way of the <HI>Indians.</HI> When the <HI>Indians</HI> that pur&s;ued me had returned, and could not find me, they concluded that I was concealed by the Merchant; and applied to the Governor that I might be delivered to them, in order that they might kill me for killing their Brother; adding, by Way of threatning, that if I was not delivered up to them, they would turn and be a|gain&s;t the <HI>French.</HI> The Governor told them, he had examined into the Matter, and found that I did not kill the <HI>Indian,</HI> nor know any Thing about it; but that he froze to Death. On this they &s;aid they would not kill me, but would have me to live with them: The Governor then in|formed them where I was, and they came and took me with them to <HI>Montreal</HI> again, and dre&s;&s;ed me in their Habit.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t of <HI>May</HI> we &s;et off to go to the <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi,</HI> where my <HI>Indian</HI> Ma&s;ter belonged, and two other <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Pri&s;oners

with them. For &s;everal Days the <HI>Indians</HI> treated me very ill; but it wore off. We went in Bark Canoes, 'till we came to Lake <HI>Sacrament,</HI> the fir&s;t Carrying-Place. We continued our Journey till we came to the <HI>Ohio,</HI> where General <HI>Braddock</HI> was de|feated. Here they took one of the Pri&s;on|ers, and with a Knife ript open his Belly, took one End of his Guts and tied to a Tree, and then whipt the mi&s;erable Man round and round 'till he expired; obliging me to dance, while they made their Game at the dying Man.</P>
<P>From hence we &s;et off to go to an <HI>In|dian</HI> Town about 200 Miles from the <HI>Ohio,</HI> where we arrived in 15 Days, and tarried three. The third Night one of the <HI>Indians</HI> had a mind to kill me; as I was &s;tanding by the Fire, he ran again&s;t me to pu&s;h me into the Flames, but I jumped over, and e&s;caped being burnt: he follow|ed me round and round, and &s;truck me &s;everal Times with his Head and Fi&s;t; which &s;o provok'd me, that as he was coming at me again, I &s;truck him and knock'd him backwards. The other <HI>In|dian</HI> laugh'd, and &s;aid <HI>I was a good Fellow.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="008557_0020_102F849BA18E5500">The next Day we &s;et off for the <HI>Mi&s;&s;i|&s;ippi,</HI> where we arrived the 23d of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> having pa&s;&s;ed over thirty-two Carrying-Places from our leaving <HI>Montreal.</HI> When we came here, I was ordered to live with a Squaw, who was to be my Mother. I liv'd with her during the Winter, and was employed in Hunting, dre&s;&s;ing Leather, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> being cloath'd after the <HI>Indian</HI> Fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>In the Spring a <HI>French</HI> Merchant came a Trading in Bark Canoes, and on his Re|turn wanted Hands to help him; he pre|vailed with my Mi&s;tre&s;s to let me go with him to <HI>Montreal.</HI> When we came there, and the Canoes were unloaded, I went in|to the Country and liv'd with his Wife's Father, and worked at the Farming-Bu|&s;ine&s;s for my Victuals and Cloathing; I fared no better than a Slave. The Family often endeavoured to per&s;uade me to be of their Religion, making many fair Promi&s;es if I would: Wanting to &s;ee what Altera|tion this would make in their Conduct to|wards me, one Sunday Morning I came to my Mi&s;tre&s;s, and &s;aid; <HI>Mother, will you give me good Cloaths if I will go to Ma&s;s?</HI> She an&s;wered, <HI>Yes, Son, as good as any in the Hou&s;e.</HI> She did &s;o, and I rode to

Church with two of her Daughters; in giving me Directions how to behave, they told me, <HI>I mu&s;t do as they did.</HI> When we came Home, I &s;at at the Table and ate with the Family, and every Night and Morn|ing was taught my Prayers.</P>
<P>Thus I lived 'till the next Spring, when my Ma&s;ter's Son-in-Law, that bro't me from the <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi,</HI> came for me to re|turn with him, as he was going again there to trade. I refus'd to go, and appli|ed to the Governor. I was then put into Goal, where I tarried 5 Weeks, living on Bread and Water and Hor&s;e-Beef. When &s;ome Pri&s;oners were going to be &s;ent to <HI>Quebeck,</HI> in order to be tran&s;ported to <HI>Old-France,</HI> I went with them: Here we laid in Goal 6 Weeks. But happening to &s;ee one of my Ma&s;ter's Sons, he prevailed with me to go back with him and work as for|merly; I con&s;ented, and tarried with him 'till the 8th of <HI>September.</HI></P>
<P>There was at the next Hou&s;e an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Lad, a Pri&s;oner; we agreed to run away together, through the Woods, that &s;o, if po&s;&s;ible, we might get home to our Friends: But how to get Provi&s;ions for the Way, we know not; 'till I was allow|ed

We agreed to &s;et off on a Sunday Morning, and were to meet at an appointed Place; which we did, and began our Journey towards <HI>Crown-Point.</HI> After we had tra|velled 22 Days, 15 of which we had no Provi&s;ion except Roots, Worms, and &s;uch like, we were &s;o weak and faint that we could &s;carce walk: My Companion gave out, and could go no further; he de&s;ired me to leave him, but I would not. I went and found three Frogs, and divided them between us. The next Morning he died. I &s;at down by him, and, at fir&s;t, conclud|ed to make a Fire, as I had my Gun, and eat his Fle&s;h, and if no Relief came, to die with him; but, finally came to this Re&s;olution;&mdash;To cut off of his Bones as much Fle&s;h as I could, and tie it up in a Handkerchief, and &s;o proceed as well as I could: Accordingly did &s;o, and buried my Companion on the Day I left him, I got three Frogs more the next Day. Be|ing weak and tired, about 9 o'Clock I &s;at down; but could not eat my Friend's Fle&s;h. I expected &s;oon to die my&s;elf;

and while I was commending my Soul to GOD, I &s;aw a Partridge light ju&s;t by me, which I thought was &s;ent by Providence; I was &s;o weak, that I could not hold out my Gun; but by re&s;ting, I brought my Peice to bear &s;o that I kill'd the Partridge. While I was eating of it, there came two Pigeons, &s;o near, that I kill'd 'em both. As I fired two Guns, I heard a Gun at a Di&s;tance: I fired again, and was an&s;wered twice. This rou&s;ed me; I got up and travelled as fa&s;t as I could towards the Re|port of the Guns; and about half a Mile off, I &s;aw three <HI>Canadians:</HI> I went to 'em and pretended to be a <HI>Dutchman,</HI> one of their own Regulars, that was lo&s;t in the Woods.

<P>When I came to the Hou&s;e, one of his Daughters met me at the Door, and pu&s;h|ed me back, and went and called her Fa|ther. At this Hou&s;e there was a <HI>French</HI> Captain, of the Regulars, billeted; he was a Prote&s;tant: He hearing my Voice, called me to him, and a&s;k'd me where I had been? Upon my telling him, he call'd me a Fool, for attempting a Thing &s;o im|po&s;&s;ible. My Ma&s;ter coming in, took me by the Shoulder, and threatned to kill me for &s;tealing his Gun when I run away: But the good Captain prevented him from u&s;ing any Violence. The Captain a&s;ked me if I had been before the Governor; I told him, I had not; and then he advis'd my Ma&s;ter to &s;end his Son with me (who was an En&s;ign among the <HI>Canadians.</HI>) When We came to a &s;mall Ferry, which we were to pa&s;s, I refu&s;ed to go any fur|ther; and after a great deal of do, he went without me.
