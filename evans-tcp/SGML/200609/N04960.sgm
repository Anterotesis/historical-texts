<HEAD>A Narrative &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day Augu&s;t</HI> 14. 1746.</P>
<P>I Left <HI>Fort-Shirley</HI> in Company with Dr. <HI>Williams,</HI> and about fourteen of the Soldiers; we went to <HI>Pelham-Fort,</HI> and from thence to Capt. <HI>Rice</HI>'s, where we lodged that Night.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> 15. We went from thence to <HI>Fort-Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts,</HI> where I de&s;ign'd to have tarried about a Month.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> 16. The Dr. with fourteen Men went off for <HI>Deerfield,</HI> and left in the Fort Serjeant <HI>John Hawks,</HI> with twenty Soldiers, about half of them &s;ick with the bloody Flux : Mr. <HI>Hawks</HI> &s;ent a Letter by the Dr. to the Captain, &s;uppo&s;ing that he was then at <HI>Deerfield,</HI> de&s;iring he would &s;peedily &s;end up &s;ome Stores to the Fort, being very &s;hort on it for Ammunition, &amp; having di&s;covered &s;ome Signs of the Enemy; but the Letter did not get to the Captain &s;ea&s;onably. This Day al&s;o two of our Men being out a few Miles di&s;tant from the Fort, di&s;covered the Tracks of &s;ome of the Enemy.</P>
<P><HI>Lord's-Day &amp; Monday</HI> 17, 18. We met with no Di&s;turbance, nor did we di&s;cover any Enemy; but the Sickne&s;s was very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, for tho' &s;ome began to amend, yet there were more taken &s;ick; eleven of our Men were &s;ick, and &s;carcely one of us in perfect Health,

almo&s;t every Man was troubled with the Griping and Flux.</P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day</HI> 19. Between eight &amp; nine o'Clock in the Morning, when thro' the good Providence of God, we were all in the Fort, twenty two Men, three Women, and five Children, there appeared an Army of French and Indians, eight or nine Hundred in Number, com|manded by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Regand de Vaudr&uuml;le</HI>; who hav|ing &s;urrounded the Fort on every Side, began with hideous Acclamations to ru&s;h forward upon the Fort, firing ince&s;&s;antly upon us on every Side. Mr. <HI>Hawks</HI> our Officer, ordered that we &s;hould let them come without firing at all at them, until they &s;hould approach within a &s;uitable Di&s;tance, that we might have a good Pro&s;pect of doing Execution. We &s;uffered them to come up in a Body 'till they were within twenty Rods of us, and then we fired; upon which the Enemy &s;oon betook them&s;elves to Trees, Stumps &amp; Logs; where they lay and fired ince&s;&s;antly upon us, &s;ome taking Opportunity to run from one Tree and Stump to another, and &s;o drew nearer to the Fort: This they did in a very &s;ubtil Manner, running &s;o crooked, that it was very difficult to &s;hoot at them with any good Pro&s;pect of Succe&s;s, until we ob&s;erved that when they came to a Stump, they would fall down; which we ob&s;erving, prepared to catch them there as they fell down by the Stumps; and this we did probably with Succe&s;s; for they &s;oon left off this Method. About this Time we &s;aw &s;everal of the Enemy fall and ri&s;e no more, among which was the Captain of the <HI>St. Francois</HI> Indians, who was one of the forema&s;t, and called upon the re&s;t to pre&s;s on upon the Fort; Serj. <HI>Hawks</HI> got in Opportunity to &s;hoot him into the Brea&s;t, which ended <HI>his</HI> Days.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="006211_0004_10280BF02EEFD2C8">At the Beginning of the Engagement, the General &s;ent his En&s;ign with his Standard (which he &s;tanding behind a Tree about thirty Rods di&s;tant from the Fort di&s;played,) the General al&s;o walked up the Hill within about forty Rods of the Fort, where he &s;tood, and gave his Orders, but being di&s;covered he had a Shot or two fired at him; upon which he moved off, but pre&s;ently after comes to his En&s;ign, where be|ing di&s;covered, he received a Shot in his Arm, which made him retreat with his En&s;ign to their Camp. The Enemy &s;till continued to fire almo&s;t ince&s;&s;antly upon us, and many of them crept up within a dozen Rods of the Fort. We were &s;traitned for want of Shot; &s;everal of our Men being newly come into the Service, and for want of Bullet Moulds, had not prepared for any long Engagement; and therefore the Serjeant or|dered &s;ome of our &s;ick Men to make Bullets, and another to run &s;ome Shot, having Shot-Moulds. This put him upon taking particular Notice of the Ammu|nition, and he found it to be very &s;hort, and therefore gave Orders that we &s;hould not fire any more than we thought nece&s;&s;ary to hold the Enemy back, unle&s;s when we had a very good Opportunity and fair Pro&s;|pect of doing Execution; &s;o that we fired but lit|tle. We had &s;ometimes very fair Shots, and had Succe&s;s; we &s;aw &s;everal fall, who we are per|&s;waded never ro&s;e again: We might have &s;hot at the Enemy almo&s;t any Time in the Day, who were in open view of the Fort, within fifty or &s;ixty Rods of the &s;ame, and &s;ometimes within forty and le&s;s, the Officers &s;ometimes walking about Sword in Hand, viewing of us, and others walking back &amp; forth as they had Oc|ca&s;ion, without Mole&s;tation, for we dare not &s;pend our

Ammunition upon them that were at &s;uch a Di&s;tance. Towards Evening the Enemy began to u&s;e their Axes and Hatchets; &s;ome were thoughtful that they were preparing Ladders in order to Storm the Fort in the Night; but afterward we found our Mi&s;take, for they were preparing Faggots in order to burn it. This Day they wounded two of our Men, <HI>viz. John Aldrich</HI> they &s;hot thro' the Foot, and <HI>Jonathan Bridgman</HI> with a Fle&s;h Wound the back Side of his Hip. When the Evening came on, the Serjeant gave Orders that all the Tubs, Pails and Ve&s;&s;els of every Sort, in every Room, &s;hould be filled with Water, and went him&s;elf to &s;ee it done; he al&s;o looked to the Doors, that they were made as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible: He like wi&s;e cut a Pa&s;|&s;age from one Room to another; that he might put the Fort into as good a Po&s;ture of Defence as might be, in Ca&s;e they &s;hould attempt to Storm it. He di&s;tributed the Men al&s;o into the &s;everal Rooms: While he was thus preparing, he kept two Men in the Northwe&s;t-Mount, and &s;ome in the great Hou&s;e the Southea&s;t Corner of the Fort, to Watch the Enemy and keep them back. I was in the Mount all the Evening, it was cloudy and very dark the Beginning of the Evening: The Enemy kept a con&s;tant Fire upon us, and as I thought, approached nearer and in greater Numbers than they had in the Day time. We had but little Encouragement to fire upon the Enemy, having nothing but the Light of their Fire to direct us, yet we dare not wholly omit it, le&s;t they &s;hould be embolden'd to Storm the Fort: We fired Buck-Shot at them, and have Rea&s;on to hope we did &s;ome Exe|cution, for the Enemy complained of our &s;hooting Buck-&s;hot at that Time, which they could not have known had
<PB N="7" REF="006211_0006_10280BB5C52732D8">
they not felt &s;ome of them. They continued thus to fire upon us, until between eight &amp; nine at Night; and then the whole Army (as we &s;uppo&s;e) &s;urrounded the Fort, &s;houted, or rather yelled with the mo&s;t hideous Out-cries all round the Fort; this they repeated <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> or four Times: We expected they would have fol|lowed this with a Storm; but were mi&s;taken, for they directly &s;et their Watch all round the Fort; and be|&s;ides their Watch, they &s;ent &s;ome to creep up as near to the Fort as they could, to ob&s;erve whether any Per|&s;ons attempted to make their E&s;cape, to carry Tidings to <HI>New-England.</HI> The Body of the Army then drew back to their Camps, &s;ome in the Swamp We&s;t of the Fort, the other Part to the South-Ea&s;t by the River Side: We then con&s;idered what was be&s;t to be done, whether to &s;end a Po&s;t down to <HI>Deerfield</HI> or not. We looked upon it very improbable, if not morally im|po&s;&s;ible for any Man to get off undi&s;covered; and therefore the Serjeant would not lay his Commands up|on any to go, but he propo&s;ed it to &s;everal, de&s;ired and encouraged them, as far as he tho't convenient; but there was not a Man willing to venture out: So the Serjeant having placed the Men in every Part of the Fort, he ordered all the &s;ick &amp; feeble Men to get what Re&s;t they could, and not to regard the Enemies Acclamations, but to lie &s;till all Night, unle&s;s he &s;hould call for them. Of tho&s;e that were in Health, &s;ome were ordered to keep the Watch, and &s;ome lay down, and endeavoured to get &s;ome Re&s;t, lying down in our Cloaths with our Arms by us; I lay down the Fore|part of the Night; we got little or no Re&s;t, the Enemy frequently rai&s;ed us by their hideous Out-cries, as tho' they were about to attack us; the latter Part of the Night I kept the Watch.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="006211_0007_10280BB925B15A60"><HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> 20. As &s;oon as it began to be Light the Enemy &s;houted and began to fire upon us for a few Minutes, and then cea&s;ed for a little Time. The Serj. ordered every Man to his Place, and &s;ent two Men up into the Watch-Box: The Enemy came into the Field of Corn to the South &amp; South-Ea&s;t of the Fort, and fought again&s;t that Side of the Fort harder than they did the Day before; but unto the Northwe&s;t Side they did not approach &s;o near as they had the fir&s;t Day, yet they kept a continual Fire on that Side: A Num|ber went up al&s;o unto the Mountain North of the Fort, where they could &s;hoot over the North-Side of the Fort into the middle of the Parade: A con&s;iderable Number of the Enemy al&s;o kept their Axes and Hat|chets continually at Work, preparing Faggots, and their &s;tubbing Hows and Spades, &amp;c. in order to burn the Fort. About eleven o'Clock <HI>Thomas Knowlton,</HI> one of our Men, being in the Watch-Box, was &s;hot thro' the Head, &s;o that &s;ome of his Brains came out, yet Life remained in him for &s;ome Hours.</P>
<P>About twelve o'Clock the Enemy de&s;ir'd to Parley: We agreed to it, and when we came to General <HI>De Voudri&uacute;le,</HI> he promi&s;ed us good Quarter if we would &s;urrender; otherwi&s;e he &s;hould endeavour to take us by Force: The Serjeant told him, he &s;hould have an An&s;wer within two Hours. We came into the Fort, and examined the State of it: The Whole of our Ammunition we did not judge to be above three or four Pounds of Powder, and not more Lead: And after Prayer unto God for Wi&s;dom &amp; Direction, we con&s;idered our Ca&s;e, whether there was any Probabi|lity of our being able to with&s;tand the Enemy or not; for we &s;uppo&s;ed that they would not leave us till they
<PB N="9" REF="006211_0008_10280BF1B7194920">
had made a vigorous Attempt upon us; and if they did, we knew our Ammunition would be &s;pent in a few Minutes Time, and then we &s;hould be obliged to lay at their Mercy: Had we all been in Health, or had there been only tho&s;e eight of us that were in Health, I believe every Man would willingly have &s;tood it out to the la&s;t; for my Part I &s;hould; but we feared, that if we were taken by Violence, the Sick, the Wounded, and the Women, would mo&s;t, if not all of them die by the Hands of the Salvages, there|fore our Officer concluded to Surrender on the be&s;t Terms he could get: Which were,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. <HI>That we &s;hould be all Pri&s;oners to the French, the General promi&s;ing that the Salvages &s;hould have nothing to do with any of us.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. <HI>That the Children &s;hould all live with their Pa|rents during the Time of their Captivity.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>III. <HI>That we &s;hould all have the Priviledge of being exchanged the fir&s;t Opportunity that pre&s;ented.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e Particulars, the General promi&s;ed that all the Pri&s;oners &s;hould have all Chri&s;tian Care and Charity exerci&s;ed towards them; that tho&s;e who were weak and unable to travel, &s;hould be carried in their Journey, that we &s;hould all be allowed to keep our Cloathing; and that we might leave a few Lines to inform our Friends what was become of us.</P>
<P>About three of the Clock we admitted the Gene|ral and a Number of his Officers into the Fort: Upon which he &s;et up his Standard: The Gate was not opened to the re&s;t; the Gentlemen &s;pake com|fortably to our People; and on our Petition that the dead Corp&s;e might not be abu&s;ed, but buried; they &s;aid, that it &s;hould be buried: But the Indians &s;eeing
<PB N="10" REF="006211_0009_10280BBC2EE5A168">
that they were &s;hut out, &s;oon fell to pulling out the Underpining of the Fort, and crept into it; opened the Gates; &s;o that the Parade was quickly full: they &s;houted as &s;oon as they &s;aw the Blood of the dead Corp&s;e under the Watch-Box, but the French kept them down for &s;ome Time, &amp; did not &s;uffer them to meddle with it: After &s;ome Time the Indians &s;eem'd to be in a Ruffle; and pre&s;ently ru&s;hed up into the Watch-Box, bro't down the dead Corp&s;e, carried it out of the Fort, &s;calpt it, and cut off the Head and Arms: A young Frenchman took one of the Arms And flay'd it, roa&s;ted the Fle&s;h, and offer'd &s;ome of it to <HI>Daniel Smeed,</HI> one of the Pri&s;oners, to eat; but he refu&s;ed it: The Frenchman dre&s;&s;ed the Skin of the Arm (as we afterwards heard) and made a Tobacco Pouch of it. After they had plundered the Fort, they &s;et it on Fire, and led us out to <HI>their</HI> Camp.</P>
<P>We had been at the Camp but a little Time, when Mon&s;. <HI>Doty,</HI> the General's Interpreter, called me a&s;ide, and de&s;ired me to &s;peak to our Soldiers &amp; per&s;wade them to go with the Indians; for he &s;aid, the Indi|ans were de&s;irous that &s;ome of them &s;hould go with them; and &s;aid, that Serj. <HI>Hawks,</HI> my&s;elf, and the Families &s;hould go with the French Officers. I an&s;|wer'd him, that it was contrary to our Agreement, and the General's Promi&s;e; and wou'd be to throw away the Lives of &s;ome of our Men, who were &s;ick and wounded: He &s;aid, no, but the Indians would be kind to them; and tho' they were all Pri&s;oners to the French yet he hoped &s;ome of them would be willing to go with the Indians. We &s;poke to Serj. <HI>Hawks,</HI> and he urged it upon him. We propo&s;ed it to &s;ome of our Men who were in Health, whether
<PB N="11" REF="006211_0010_10280BF4C9129220">
they were willing to go or not, but they were utterly unwilling. I returned to <HI>Doty,</HI> and told him that we &s;hould by Means con&s;ent that any of our Men &s;hould go with the Indians, we took the General to be a Man of Honour; and we hop'd to find him &s;o; we knew that it was the Manner of the Indians to abu&s;e their Pri&s;oners; and &s;ometimes to kill tho&s;e that failed in travelling, and carrying Packs, which we knew that &s;ome of our Men could not do; and we thought it but little better for the General to deliver them to the Indians, than it would be to abu&s;e them him&s;elf; and had I tho't that the General would have delivered any of our Men to the Salvages, I &s;hould have &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed the Surrender of the Fort, for I had rather have died in Fight, than to &s;ee any of our Men killed, while we had no Op|portunity to re&s;i&s;t. He &s;aid, that the General would &s;ee, that they &s;hould not be abu&s;ed; and he did not like it that I was &s;o jealous and afraid: I told him, I was not the Officer, but as he &s;pake to me, &s;o I had freely &s;poken my Mind, and di&s;charged my Duty in it; and he had no Rea&s;on to be offended, and I hoped the General would not in&s;i&s;t on this Thing, but would make good his promi&s;e to all the Pri&s;oners. He went to the General, and after a little Time, the Officers came and took away <HI>John Perry</HI> &amp; his Wife, and all the Soldiers, but Serj. <HI>Hawk, John Smeed</HI> and <HI>Mo&s;es Scot</HI> and their Families, and di&s;tributed them among the Indians; &s;ome French Officers took the Care of the Families, viz. <HI>Smeed's</HI> and <HI>Scot's</HI>; and Mon&s;. <HI>Demuy</HI> took me with him, and <HI>M. St. Luc Lacorn</HI> took Serj. <HI>Hawks</HI> with him; and &s;o we re|po&s;ed that Night, having a &s;trong Guard &s;et over us.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="006211_0011_10280BC0C0846688"><HI>Thur&s;day</HI> 21. In the Morning I obtained Liberty to go to the Place of the Fort, and &s;et up a Letter, which I did, with a Frenchman and &s;ome Indians in Company: I nailed the Letter up on the Well Po&s;t. This Morning I &s;aw <HI>Jo&s;iah Reed,</HI> who was very weak and feeble by Rea&s;on of his long &amp; tedious Sickne&s;s; I interceeded with the General for him, that he would not &s;end him with the Indians, but could not prevail; I al&s;o interceeded with the General for <HI>John Aldrich,</HI> who being wounded in the Foot was notable to travel; but the Interpreter told me they mu&s;t go with the Indians, but they &s;hould not be hurt; and that they had Canoes a little down the River, in which the Weak and Feeble &s;hould be carried: We then put up our Things, and &s;et out on our March for <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> going down the River in <HI>Hoo&s;uck</HI> Road: I was toward the Front, and within about half a Mile. I overtook <HI>John Perry</HI>'s Wife, I pa&s;s'd by her, M. <HI>Demuy</HI> travelling a-pace; I &s;poke with her, and a&s;k'd her, how &s;he did?

We went about four Miles to the Place where the Army en|camped the Night before they came upon us: Here I overtook Neighbour <HI>Perry,</HI> which &s;urprized me, for I tho't he had been behind me with the French, but he was with the Indians. I a&s;ked him after his Health, he &s;aid, <HI>That he was better than he had been.</HI> I inquired after his Wife, he &s;aid, <HI>he did not know where &s;he was; but was &s;omewhere with the Indians:</HI> Which &s;urprized me very much, for I tho't till then

&s;he was with the French. Here we &s;at down for a con&s;iderable Time: my Heart was filled with Sor|row, expecting that many of our weak and feeble People would fall by the mercile&s;s Hands of the E|nemy: And as I frequently heard the Salvages &s;hout|ing &amp; yelling, I trembled, concluding that they then murdered &s;ome of our People: And this was my only Comfort, that they could do nothing again&s;t us, but what God in his holy Providence permitted 'em; but was fill'd with Admiration when I &s;aw all the Pri&s;oners come up with us, and <HI>John Aldrich</HI> carry'd upon the Back of his Indian Ma&s;ter. We &s;et out again, and had gone but a little Way before we came up with <HI>Jo&s;iah Reed,</HI> who gave out: I expected they would have knock'd him on the Head &amp; kill'd him, but an Indian carried him on his Back. We made &s;everal Stops, and after we had travelled about eight Miles, we made a con&s;iderable Stay; where we re|fre&s;hed our &s;elves; and I had an Opportunity to &s;peak to &s;everal of the Pri&s;oners, e&s;pecially <HI>John Smeed</HI> and his Wife, who being near her Time, was filled with Admiration at the Goodne&s;s of GOD in &s;trength|ning her to travel &s;o far. I &s;aw <HI>John Perry</HI>'s Wife; &s;he complained that &s;he was almo&s;t ready to give out; &s;he complained al&s;o of the Indian that &s;he went with, that he threatned her.

this. After we had travelled round the Fields, I tho't he was about to leave the River, which increa&s;ed my Fears; but I found out the Rea&s;on, for they only went to look &s;ome Buildings to plunder &amp; burn 'em. A little before Sun-&s;et we arrived at <HI>Vandeverickes</HI> Place, where we found &s;ome of the Army, who had arriv'd before us, but mo&s;t of them were &s;till behind; and I had the Comfort to &s;ee the greate&s;t Part of the Pri&s;oners come up; God having wonderfully &s;trength|ned many who were Weak, the French carrying the Women: There were &s;ome few that tarried behind about two Miles; where Mrs. <HI>Smeed</HI> was taken in Travail; and &s;ome of the French made a Seat for her to &s;it upon, and bro't her to the Camp; where about ten o'Clock &s;he was graciou&s;ly delivered of a Daughter, and was remarkably well; the Child al&s;o was well; but this Night <HI>Jo&s;iah Reed,</HI> being very ill, either died of his Illne&s;s, or el&s;e was kill'd by the Enemy; which, I never could certainly know, but I fear he was murdered.</P>

This Morning I baptized <HI>John Smeed</HI>'s Child, he called its Name <HI>Captivity.</HI> The French then made a Frame like a Bier, and laced a Buck&s;kin and Bear&s;kin upon it, and lay'd Mrs. <HI>Smeed</HI> with her Infant thereon; and &s;o two Men at a Time carried them: They al&s;o carried <HI>Mo&s;es Scot</HI>'s Wife &amp; two Children, &amp; another of <HI>Smeed</HI>'s Children; the Indians al&s;o carry'd in their Canoes Br. <HI>Simon</HI> &amp; <HI>John Aldrich,</HI> and <HI>Perry</HI>'s Wife down the River about ten Miles. We had remarkable Smiles of Providence; our Men that had been &s;ick, grew better, &amp; recover'd Strength; the Enemy killed &s;ome Cattle, which they found in the Meadows, &s;o that we had plenty of fre&s;h Provi|ons
<PB N="15" REF="006211_0014_1027DA448FCA1958">
and Broth, which was very beneficial to the Sick. I then expre&s;&s;ed a Concern for the feeble People, un|der&s;tanding that we were to leave the River, and travel thro' the Wilderne&s;s near &s;ixty Miles; but M. <HI>Demuy</HI> told me I need not fear, for the General had promi&s;ed tho&s;e Indians a Reward who had the Care of the feeble Per&s;ons, if they would be Kind &amp; carry them thro' the Journey. This Night I vi&s;ited mo&s;t of the Pri&s;oners: This Night al&s;o died two Indians of their Wounds. The Enemy had got four Hor&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> 23. This Morning the General &s;ent off an Officer with &s;ome Men to carry News to <HI>Canada.</HI> This Day we left the River &amp; travelled in the Wil|derne&s;s in &s;omething of a Path, and good travelling for the Wilderne&s;s, &s;omething Ea&s;t of North, about fifteen Miles, the French &s;till carrying <HI>Smeed</HI>'s and <HI>Scot</HI>'s Wives &amp; Children, the Indians finding Hor&s;es for Br. <HI>Simon</HI> &amp; <HI>John Aldrich; Perry</HI> being relea&s;ed from his Pack was allowed to help his Wife, &amp; carry her when &s;he was weary. About three in the After|noon, they were alarmed by di&s;covering the Tracts of a Scout from <HI>Sarratogo</HI>; this put them into a con&s;i|derable Ruffle, fearing that there might be an Army after them; but I pre&s;umed that they need not be concerned about it; the Body of the Army lodged between two Ponds, but Part with a Number of the Pri&s;oners were &s;ent forward about two Miles 'till they cro&s;s'd <HI>Sarratago-River</HI>; it is there 20 Rods wide, but &s;hallow Water. This Night died two more In|dians of their Wounds.</P>
<P><HI>Lord's-Day</HI> 24. This Day we &s;et out in the Morn|ing, and came to <HI>Sarratago-River,</HI> cro&s;s'd it, and came to our Company, which had been before us;
<PB N="16" REF="006211_0015_10280BC8FB329E08">
here we came to a rich Piece of Meadow-Ground, and travelled in it about five Miles: We had good travelling this Day: We cro&s;s'd &s;everal Pieces of good Meadow-Land: We went about eighteen Miles. <HI>John Perry</HI>'s Wife performed this Day's Journey without Help from any. Our &s;ick &amp; feeble Per&s;ons were remarkably pre&s;erved to Day; for about two o'Clock in the Afternoon there fell a very heavy Shower of Rain, which wet us thro' all our Cloaths. Mrs. <HI>Smeed</HI> was as wet as any of us, and it being the third Day after her Delivery, we were concerned a|bout the Event, but thro' the good Providence of GOD &s;he never perceived any Harm by it, nor did any other Per&s;on, but <HI>Miriam</HI> the Wife of <HI>Mo&s;es Scot,</HI> who hereby catch'd a grievous Cold. This Night we lodg'd in a Meadow, where was a Run of Water, which makes a Part of <HI>Wood-Creek.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> 25. This Morning we &s;et out and tra|velled about eleven Miles: We had &s;omething rough travelling to Day; we quickly left the &s;mall Stream we lodged by at our right Hand to the Ea&s;t of us, and travelling a few Miles over &s;ome &s;mall Hills and Ledges, came to a Stream running from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, about two or three Rods in Width, and about two Feet deep; we cro&s;s'd it, our general Cour&s;e being North; we travelled about two or three Miles farther, and came to a Stream running from South-We&s;t to North-Ea&s;t, about &s;ix Rods in Width, which we cro&s;s'd; and this Stream (which we &s;uppo&s;e to be <HI>Wood-Creek</HI>) according to the be&s;t of my Remem|brance, and according to the &s;hort Minute that I made of this Day's travel) we left at our right Hand to the Ea&s;t of us; but Serjeant <HI>Hawks</HI> thinks I am

mi&s;taken, and that we cro&s;s'd it again, and left it at the left Hand We&s;t of us: I won't be certain, but I can't per&s;wade my &s;elf that I am mi&s;taken. The French and Indians helping our feeble People, we all arrived well at our Camp, which was by a cou|ple of Ponds; &s;ome few who were before us went to the drowned Land.</P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day</HI> 26. This Day we took our Journey; our Cour&s;e in the Morning &s;omething We&s;t of North; in travelling about three or four Miles we came to a Mountain a &s;teep A&s;cent about eighty or a hundred Rods, but not rocky; after we pa&s;t this Mountain, our Cour&s;e was about We&s;t five or &s;ix Miles, 'till we came to the drowned Land: When we came to the Canoes, the Stream ran from North Ea&s;t to South We&s;t; we embarked about two o'clock, the Stream quickly turned, and ran to the North; we &s;ailed about 18 or 20 Miles that Night, and en|camped on the Ea&s;t Side of the Water.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> 23. We embarked about nine o'Clock and &s;ailed to <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> &s;omething better than 20 Miles; &s;ome of the Army went in the Night before, and &s;ome before the Body of the Army. The Sails were pulled down, and the Canoes bro't up a-brea&s;t and pa&s;&s;ed by the Fort over to the North Ea&s;t Point &s;aluting the Fort with three Volleys, as we pa&s;s'd by it; the Fort returning the Salute by the di&s;charge of the Cannon: This was about twelve o'Clock. Here we tarried 'till the 4th of <HI>September.</HI> I lodged in an Hou&s;e on the North Ea&s;t Point. We all arriv'd better in Health, than when we were fir&s;t taken.</P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day</HI> 28. This Day I was invited by Mon&s;ieur <HI>Demuy</HI> to go over and &s;ee the Fort, which I did:
<PB N="18" REF="006211_0017_10280BCA85209B58">
It is &s;omething an irregular Form, having five Sides to it, the Rampers twenty Feet thick, the Brea&s;t-Work two Feet &amp; half, the whole about twenty Feet high; there were 21 or 22 Guns upon the Wall, &s;ome four &amp; &s;ix Pounders, and there may be &s;ome as large as nine Pounders; the Citadel an Octagon built, three Stories high, fifty or 60 FeetDiameter, built with Stone laid in Lime, the Wall &s;ix or &s;even Feet thick, arched over the &s;econd &amp; third Stories for Bomb-Proof; in the Chambers 9 or 10 Guns, &s;ome of 'em may be 9 Pounders, and I believe none le&s;s than &s;ix, &amp; near 20 Patararoes; but as my Time was &s;hort, I can't be very particular: They have Stores of &s;mall Arms, as Blunderbu&s;&s;es, Pi&s;tols, &amp; Mu&s;kets. This Night prov'd very cold and &s;tormy.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> 29. This Morning <HI>Smeed</HI>'s &amp; <HI>Scot</HI>'s Fami|lies were bro't out of their Tents into the Hou&s;e, that they might be the more comfortable: it rained, and was very cold all the Day, and at Night the Wind was very high.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> 30. Was &s;omething warmer.</P>
<P><HI>Lord's-Day</HI> 31. We had the Liberty of wor&s;hip|ping GOD together in a Room by our &s;elves. This Day about 12 o'Clock the Enemy who went off from us from <HI>Hoo&s;uck</HI> the Morning after we were taken, re|turned and brought in &s;ix &s;calps, viz. <HI>Samuel Allen, Eleazer Hawks,</HI> Jun. two <HI>Am&s;dell's,</HI> all of <HI>Deedfield, Adonijah Gillet</HI> of <HI>Colche&s;ter, Constant Bli&s;s</HI> of <HI>Hebron</HI>; and one Captive, viz <HI>Samuel Allen,</HI> Son to him who was kill'd; he was taken with his Father &amp; <HI>Eliazer Hawks</HI>; the <HI>Am&s;dells</HI> and <HI>Gillet</HI> were kill'd in <HI>Deer|field South-Meadow Augu&s;t</HI> 25; the Indians al&s;o ac|knowledged they lo&s;t one Man there.

<P><HI>Monday Sept.</HI> 1. <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> 2. <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> 3. We tarried &s;till at <HI>Crown-Point.</HI> The Weather was &s;ome|thing lowry but warm: I lived with the General and about half a dozen more Officers, who lodg'd in the &s;ame Hou&s;e; our Diet was very good, it being chiefly fre&s;h Meat &amp; Broth, which was a great Benefit to me: We had al&s;o plenty of <HI>Bourdeaux</HI> Wine, which being of an a&s;tringent Nature, was a great Kindne&s;s to me (having at that Time &s;omething of the Grip|ing and bloody Flux) While we lay here, we wrote a Letter to the Hon. <HI>John Stoddard,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> at <HI>Northampton,</HI> to give him a particular Account of our Fight and Surrender; as al&s;o &s;ome other private Letters; the French Gentlemen giving us Encouragement that they would &s;end them down by &s;ome of their Scouts, to &s;ome Part of our Frontiers, and leave them &s;o that they &s;hould be found; but I have not heard of them &s;ince, and conclude that they de&s;troyed them.</P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day</HI> 4. We embarked for <HI>Canada,</HI> about ten o'Clock, and &s;ailed about 15 Miles; our Cour&s;e I judged to be North about ten Degrees Ea&s;t, which I take to be the general Cour&s;e from <HI>Crown-Point</HI> to <HI>Champlain.</HI> Towards Night we turned into a Cove the Ea&s;t Side of the Lake, and encamped, having the Land upon the South We&s;t South &amp; Ea&s;t of us: Here we were to wait for General <HI>De Vaudri&uuml;le,</HI> whom we left at <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> and expected would come to us this Night, or in the Morning; but the Night proved very &s;tormy.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="006211_0019_10280BCD8B96B0A8"><HI>Friday</HI> 5. The Wind blowing hard from the North, and &s;ome Rain, we lay by to Day</P>
<P><HI>Saturday</HI> 6. About nine o'Clock this Morning the General came up with us; then we embark'd and &s;ailed with a pretty good Wind the bigger Part of the Day: Towards Night we &s;aw a few Hou&s;es on the We&s;t Side of the Lake, but I &s;uppo&s;e that they were de&s;erted. We &s;ailed at lea&s;t three &s;core Miles this Day; we came too where the Lake was but a few Miles in Width, and encamped on the Ea&s;t Shore, where there was a Wind-Mill &amp; a few Hou&s;es, but were all de&s;erted.</P>
<P><HI>Lords's-Day</HI> 7. We ro&s;e early and &s;et &s;ail as &s;oon as it was fair Day-Light, having a good Wind, but the Wind fell about eight o'Clock, that they were obliged to ply their Paddles. When we came to the End of the Lake about eleven o'Clock, and were entring <HI>Champlain-River,</HI> we met a Boat with three Men in it, who brought a Packet of Letters for the Officers in the Army; they gave one or two to Mon&s;. <HI>Demuy</HI>: After reading the Letters he told me the News he had by them, <HI>viz.</HI> 'That there were a Number of Ships arriv'd from <HI>France</HI> to <HI>Que|bec,</HI> who had brought them plenty of Stores; that they came in Company with a Fleet of 40 large Men of War from the <HI>Bre&s;t</HI> &amp; <HI>Toulon</HI> Squadron, and gave the following Account; that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Fleet having blocked up the <HI>Bre&s;t</HI> Squadron in the Harbour, the Admiral of the <HI>Brest</HI> Squadron wrote to the Ad|mirals of the <HI>Toulon</HI> &amp; <HI>Rochfort</HI> Squadrons to come to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance; who coming on the Back of the Engli&s;h Fleet, and the <HI>Bre&s;t</HI> Squadron i&s;&s;uing out at the &s;ame Time again&s;t them, there en&s;ued a terrible

Fight, in which the <HI>French</HI> prevailed, and &s;unk one half of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships, and put the re&s;t to Flight, and then they &s;ailed for <HI>North-America</HI>; that the King &s;ent with them 12 Merchant Ships with Stores of Ammunition, Cloathing, Wine &amp; Brandy, and a thou&s;and Soldiers to &s;trengthen <HI>Canada</HI>; that the Men of War were divided into two Fleets, one of which did now block up <HI>Loui&s;bourg,</HI> &amp; were fighting again&s;t it; and the other Part of the Fleet was gone for <HI>Bo&s;ton:</HI> He &s;aid that their King was very angry with <HI>New-England</HI> for their taking <HI>Cape-Breton</HI>; and it was probable he would bring them into Subjection: He told me al&s;o that they bro't News that <HI>Edward Stuart</HI> the Pretender's younge&s;t Son was in the North of <HI>England,</HI> and had a powerful Army; &amp; that great Numbers of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> re&s;orted to him daily, &amp; it was probable he would prevail to dethrone King <HI>George.</HI>' I told him that as for <HI>this</HI> and the <HI>Fight at Sea,</HI> I had good Rea&s;on to think they were fal&s;e, for I had News from <HI>England</HI> &s;ince the <HI>Bre&s;t</HI> Fleet had failed out, and there was no Account of the&s;e Things, but the con|trary. He told me al&s;o that Prince <HI>William</HI> the Duke of <HI>Cumberland</HI> was kill'd in Battle at <HI>Culloden-Muir,</HI> and that he was the only Per&s;on of the Hou&s;e of <HI>Ha|nover</HI> which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation loved; &s;o that altho' the King's Army got the Victory, yet it was a Lo&s;s to his Intere&s;t, for the Duke being dead, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation would revolt from the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover,</HI> be|ing weary of it, and turn to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Stuart's.</HI>' But I told him, that the <HI>Duke of Cumberland</HI> was yet alive, and as he had been a Scourge &amp; Terror to the King's Enemies, &s;o we had Rea&s;on to hope he would &s;till be; he grew warm in his Debate, call'd the King

a U&s;urper, the Nation in bringing of him in, <HI>Cromell's</HI> Faction; and many other Things: Upon which we had a con&s;iderable Debate, until he grew more mild, and began to flatter, and told me, what an amiable Man the <HI>Pretender</HI> was, and what good Times it would be if he came to the Throne of <HI>England,</HI> giv|ing free Liberty of Con&s;cience to all his Subjects, and he did not doubt but that they would return to the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> which was the true Church: Our Children, he believ'd would come to a good Union in Religion.</P>
<P>We went on Shore at the fir&s;t Hou&s;e about three Miles above the Fort; where they were called toge|ther, and &s;aid their Prayers; and as &s;oon as they had done, Mon&s;. <HI>Demuy</HI> read his Letter; upon which, they all &s;houted, crying <HI>Vive le Roy:</HI> q. d. <HI>Let the King live.</HI> Upon which, &s;everal of the young Men came laughing to me, and by Signs endeavoured to inform me what the News was. I concluded that the&s;e fine Tales were framed and &s;ent to meet the Army, in order to keep up the Courage of the com|mon People and of the Indians, who &s;eemed to re|pent of their engaging in the War, and to grow very weary of it: Tho' I found afterwards that the <HI>Brest</HI> Fleet was actually come over, with a De&s;ign again&s;t <HI>New-England.</HI> From thence we travelled down to <HI>Champlain</HI>; where the Gentlemen &s;et up their Tents, and we had great Numbers to vi&s;it us of both Sexes: There I expected we &s;hould have tarried that Night, but a little before the Sun-&s;etting M. <HI>Demuy</HI> came and ordered his Canoe's Company to embark, &amp; go down the River, and told me, I mu&s;t go with them, and whatever I &s;tood in Need of, his People would

give me: And indeed I wanted nothing, having good fre&s;h Provi&s;ions, and plenty of Wine to drink; but was &s;omething &s;urpriz'd at this &s;udden Remove, and could never know the Rea&s;on of it, unle&s;s it was this, <HI>viz&punc;</HI> Some of the French &amp; Indians going out from <HI>Crown-Point</HI> while I lay there, fell on a Number of our Men near <HI>Sarratago</HI>; had killed &s;ome &amp; taken &s;ome Pri&s;oners, and were come to <HI>Champlain</HI> with one of them; and they wanted to get what News from him they could; and &s;o cho&s;e to get me out of the Way, &amp; &s;ome others, le&s;t we might give him a Caution; and he really wanted a Caution, for he told them that which he had better have kept to him&s;elf, <HI>viz.</HI> the mi&s;erable Circum&s;tances of <HI>Sarra|tago</HI> Fort. We failed down the River about three Miles, and lodged at a poor Man's Hou&s;e, who ac|cording to his Ability, was courteous to me: I lodged with him in his own Bed; which was the fir&s;t Bed I had lodged in &s;ince my Captivity; and tho' it was a hard Bed, and de&s;titute of Linnen, yet it was very comfortable to me.</P>
<P><HI>Monday</HI> 8. This Morning there came an Engli&s;h|man to &s;eeme, his Name <HI>Littlefield</HI>: He was taken a Lad from <HI>Pi&s;cataqua,</HI> and &s;o continued with the French, and lived, having a Family, at <HI>Champlain</HI>: We had con&s;iderable Di&s;cour&s;e together. About eight o'Clock we embarked; &s;ome Canoes pa&s;&s;ing down the River on the oppo&s;ite Side. We &s;ailed over the River, and met with Mon&s;. <HI>Demuy,</HI> &amp; took him in: We &s;ailed down the River about 15 Miles, and dined with a Prie&s;t. The Country on <HI>Champlain-River</HI> appeared very poor, it being cold &s;our Land; it is inhabited on each Side, but the Buildings are

generally but poor Hutts.

I told him, they fought Courageou&s;ly: He &s;aid, true, but they were taken notwith&s;tanding: He &s;aid, they had taken three Hundred &amp; twenty Men out of her, who were com|ing up to <HI>Quebec,</HI> where I &s;hould meet them.' This was nothing but the <HI>Albany</HI> Sloop, one of the Men of War's Tenders, which Governour <HI>Knowles</HI> &s;ent with a Pacquet from <HI>Loui&s;bourg</HI> for <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI>: There were but &s;eventy Men in her; &s;he was taken by a French Man of War near <HI>Jebucta.</HI> About two o' Clock it began to Rain, and continued a cold Rain all the re&s;t of the Day. We &s;ailed down the River between 30 and 40 Miles, and then carried over our Canoes &amp; Packs acro&s;s the Land to <HI>St. Lawrence,</HI> which was about three Miles, and we came to it above <HI>Lozel,</HI> and there we lodged that Night in a French Hou&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day</HI> 9. This Morning being &s;omething lowry, we did not &s;et out very early: The Wind was North|ea&s;terly and pretty high: About nine o'Clock we &s;et Sail up the River for <HI>Mountreal</HI>; it was good &s;ailing; we dined at a French Gentleman's Hou&s;e on the Ea&s;tern Shore: There was an Iri&s;h Doctor came and dined with us. his Name <HI>O Sullivan:</HI> He pre|tended a great deal of Re&s;pect for me, &amp; Compa&s;&s;ion towards all the Pri&s;oners; a great deal of Friend&s;hip to the Engli&s;h Nation, and e&s;pecially for the Hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover</HI>; and he inquired after the State of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and pretended to rejoyce that the <HI>Duke of

Cumberland</HI> had got &s;uch a Victory over the Pretender and the Rebels; but I pre&s;ently found he grew weary in hearing the Particulars; and therefore to mortify him the more, I told him all that I could; then we &s;et &s;ail, and went within about five Miles of <HI>Mount-Real</HI>; the Weather was &s;omething tedious; and it rained in the Afternoon.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> 10 This Morning it rained very hard 'till near ten o'Clock; about which Time the Gene|ral and &s;ome others pa&s;&s;ed by us, and we embark'd directly upon it, and arrived at <HI>Mount Real,</HI> about twelve o'Clock. Mon&s;. <HI>Demuy,</HI> took me to the Go|vernour's: He &s;aid but little to me; he only told me, that for the Time I tarried at <HI>Mount-Real.</HI> I &s;hould keep at Mon&s;. <HI>Demuy</HI>'s, but that after a few Days he mu&s;t &s;end me, with the re&s;t of the Pri&s;oners, to <HI>Quebec.</HI> I went with Mon&s;. <HI>Demuy</HI> and was courteou&s;ly en|tertained by him for the Time I tarried at <HI>Mount-Real</HI>: In the Afternoon came an Engli&s;h Wo|man to vi&s;it me; &s;he was I judged between 60 and 70 Years of Age; &s;he was taken when a Child from <HI>Merrimack-River,</HI> her Name <HI>Hannah Rie</HI>; &s;he had been married to a Frenchman, by whom &s;he had four Children, three Sons &amp; one Daughter; her Daughter was married and had &s;everal Children, and came to &s;ee me; I &s;aw al&s;o one of her Sons; &s;he had been a Widow about 14 Years, but was under very com|fortable Circum&s;tances. There was another Engli&s;h-Woman came to &s;ee me who was taken from the Ea&s;t|ward, but I have forgot both her Name, and Place where &s;he was taken from.</P>
<P><HI>Friday</HI> 11. This Day I tarried at Mon&s;. <HI>Demuy's</HI>: Where the Major of the Town vi&s;ited me; he told

<P><HI>Friday</HI> 12.

<P>We were conducted by a &s;trong Guard to the Governor's Yard, where we were kept 'till near Night, when we were conducted to the Back of the Town to the old Wall in a Bow of which they had &s;et up &s;ome Plank Tents &s;omething like Sheeps-Pens; we had Boards flung down to lay our Beds up|on, but the Tents generally leaked &s;o much in wet Weather, that none of us could lie dry; and had much wet Weather this Month.</P>
<P>The Gentlemen of our Room &s;ent in a Petition the Be|ginning of <HI>May,</HI> that they might be removed to &s;ome more convenient Place; upon which we had a Hou&s;e built for us in the Pri&s;oners Yard, about 20 Feet Square, into which we were removed the 23d In&s;tant.
