<HEAD>NEW-YEAR VERSES, FOR THOSE WHO CARRY THE <HI>PENNSYLVANIA</HI> GAZETTE TO THE CUSTOMERS. <HI>JANUARY,</HI> 1, 1784.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>HOW Things have chang'd &s;ince la&s;t New-Year,</L>
<L>What di&s;mal Pro&s;pects then aro&s;e!</L>
<L>Scarce at your Doors I dar'd appear,</L>
<L>So multifarious were our Woes:</L>
<L>But Time at length has chang'd the Scene,</L>
<L>Our Pro&s;pects now are more &s;erene.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Bad News we brought you every Day,</L>
<L>Your Seamen &s;lain, your Ships on Shore,</L>
<L>The Army fretting for their Pay&mdash;</L>
<L>'Twas well they had not fretted more!</L>
<L>'Twas wrong indeed to wear out Shoes,</L>
<L>To bring you nothing but bad News.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now let's be joyful for the change&mdash;</L>
<L>The Folks that guard the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Throne</L>
<L>Have giv'n us ample Room to range,</L>
<L>And more, perhaps, than was their own;</L>
<L>To We&s;tern Lakes they &s;tretch our Bounds,</L>
<L>And yield the <HI>Indian</HI> Hunting Grounds.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But pray read on another Year,</L>
<L>Remain the humble News-man's Friend;</L>
<L>And he'll engage to let you hear</L>
<L>What <HI>Europe</HI>'s Princes next intend.&mdash;</L>
<L>E'en now their Brains are all at work,</L>
<L>To rou&s;e the <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> on the <HI>Turk.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Well&mdash;if they fight, then fight they mu&s;t,</L>
<L>They are a &s;trange, contentious Breed;</L>
<L>One good Effect will be, I tru&s;t,</L>
<L>The more that's kill'd, the more you'll read;</L>
<L>For <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Experience <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">lly &s;hews,</L>
<L>THAT WRANGLING IS THE LIFE OF NEWS.</L>
