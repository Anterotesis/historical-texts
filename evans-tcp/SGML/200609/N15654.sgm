<HEAD>A NARRATIVE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ON Wedne&s;day the Twenty-Ninth Day of June, 1785, late in the Evening, a large Com|pany of armed Men pa&s;&s;ed the
<PB N="8" REF="019979_0008_0FAD4837042FDA88">
Hou&s;e, on their Way to <HI>Kentucky</HI>; &s;ome Part of whom incamped within two Miles. Mr. <HI>Scott</HI> liv|ing on a Frontier Part, generally made the Family watchful; but on this calamitous Day, after &s;o large a Body of Men had pa&s;&s;ed, &s;hortly after Night, he lay down in his Bed, and imprudently left one of the Doors of his Hou&s;e open; the Children were al&s;o in Bed and a&s;leep. Mrs. <HI>Scott</HI> was nearly undre&s;&s;ed, when, to her un|utterable A&s;toni&s;hment and Horror, &s;he &s;aw ru&s;hing in through the Door that was left open, pain|ted Savages with pre&s;ented Arms, rai&s;ing a hideous Shriek;&mdash;Mr. <HI>Scott</HI> being awake, in&s;tantly jum|ped out of his Bed, but was imme|diately fired at: He forced his
<PB N="9" REF="019979_0009_0FAD483826D4BC20">
Way through the Middle of the Enemy and got out of the Door, but fell a few Paces from thence. An Indian &s;eized Mrs. <HI>Scott</HI> and ordered her to a particular Spot and not to move; others &s;tabbed and cut the Throats of the three younge&s;t Children in their Bed, and afterwards lifted them up and da&s;hed them down on the Floor, near the Mother; the elde&s;t, a beau|tiful Girl of eight Years old, awoke and e&s;caped out of the Bed, and ran to her Parent, and, with the mo&s;t plaintive Accents, cried, 'O Mam|ma! Mamma! &s;ave me!' The Mother, in the deepe&s;t Angui&s;h of Spirit and with a Flood of Tears, in|treated the Savages to &s;pare her Child; but with a brutal Fierce|ne&s;s, they tomahawked and &s;tab|bed her in the Mother's Arms. Adjacent to Mr. <HI>Scott</HI>'s Dwelling-Hou&s;e,
<PB N="10" REF="019979_0010_0FAD4838F93DA7F0">
another Family lived, of the name of <HI>Ball.</HI> The Indians al&s;o attacked them at the &s;ame In&s;tant they did Mr. <HI>Scott</HI>'s; but the Door being &s;hut, the Enemy fired into the Hou&s;e thro' an Opening be|tween two Logs, and killed a young Lad, and then e&s;&s;ayed to force the Door open; but a &s;urviving Bro|ther fired through the Door, and the Enemy de&s;i&s;ted and went off: The remaining Part of the Family ran out of the Hou&s;e and e&s;caped. In Mr. <HI>Scott</HI>'s Hou&s;e were four good Rifles well loaded, and a great Quantity of Cloathing and Furni|ture, Part of which belonged to People that had left it on their Way to <HI>Kentucky.</HI> The Indians loaded them&s;elves with the Plunder, being thirteen in Number, then &s;peedily made off, and continued travelling all Night; next Morning their

<P>The Eleventh Day after Mrs. <HI>Scott</HI>'s Captivity, the four Indians that had her in Charge &s;topped at a Place of Rendezvous, and to hunt, being now in great want of Provi|&s;ions. Three went out, and the Chief, being an old Man, was left to take Care of the Pri&s;oner, who, by this Time expre&s;&s;ed a Willing|ne&s;s to proceed to the Indian Towns, which &s;eemed to have the de&s;ired Effect of le&s;&s;ening her Kee|per's Vigilance. In the Day-Time, as the old Man was graining a Deer Skin, the Captive, pondering on her Situation, and anxiou&s;ly look|ing for an Opportunity to make her E&s;cape, took the Re&s;olution, and

Liberty to go a &s;mall Di&s;tance to a Stream of Water, to wa&s;h the Blood off her Apron, that had re|mained be&s;meared &s;ince the fatal Night of the Murder of her little Daughter. He &s;aid to her in the Engli&s;h Tongue, "Go along;" &s;he then pa&s;&s;ed by him, his Face being in a contrary Direction from that &s;he was going, and he very bu|&s;y. She, after getting to the
<PB N="13" REF="019979_0013_0FAD483AD92A5260">
Water, proceeded on without Delay, made to a high barren Mountain, and travelled until late in the Evening, when &s;he came down to the Valley, in &s;earch of the Track &s;he had been taken along; hop|ing thereby to find the Way back, with|out the Ri&s;que of being lo&s;t, and peri&s;h|ing with Hunger in uninhabited Parts.</P>
<P>On coming acro&s;s the Valley to the River-Side, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Ea&s;terly Branch of <HI>Kentucky-River,</HI> &s;he ob&s;erved in the Sand, Tracks of two Men, that had gone up the River, and had ju&s;t re|turned.&mdash;She concluded the&s;e to have been her Pur&s;uers, which excited Emo|tions of Gratitude and Thankfulne&s;s to Divine Providence for &s;o timeous a De|liverance. Being without any Provi&s;ions, having no kind of Weapon or Tool to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in getting any, and being al|mo&s;t de&s;titute of Cloathing, al&s;o know|ing that a va&s;t Tract of rugged high Mountains intervened, between where where &s;he was and the Inhabitants Ea&s;t|wardly; and the Di&s;tance of the <HI>Ken|tucky</HI> Settlements unknown, and &s;he al|mo&s;t as ignorant as a Child of the Me|thod of &s;teering through the Woods, ex|cited
<PB N="14" REF="019979_0014_0FAD483B983DF690">
painful Sen&s;ations.&mdash;But certain Death, either by Hunger or by wild Bea&s;ts, &s;eemed preferrable, rather than to be in the Power of Beings who had excited in her Mind &s;uch Horrour. She addre&s;&s;ed Heaven for Protection, and taking Courage, proceeded onward. Af|ter travelling three Days &s;he had nearly met with the Indians, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, that had been &s;ent to <HI>Clinch</HI> to &s;teal Hor|&s;es, but providentially hearing their ap|proach, concealed her&s;elf among the Cane, until the Enemy had pa&s;&s;ed. This giving a fre&s;h Alarm, and her Mind be|ing filled with Con&s;ternation, &s;he got lo&s;t, proceeding backwards and forwards for &s;everal Days: At length &s;he came to a River, that &s;eemed to come from the Ea&s;t&punc; concluding it was <HI>Sandy-River,</HI> &s;he re&s;olved to trace it to its Source, which is adjacent to the <HI>Clinch</HI> Settle|ment. After proceeding up the River &s;everal Days, &s;he came to where the Ri|ver runs through the <HI>Great Laurel Moun|tain,</HI> where is a prodigious Water-Fall, and numerous high craggy Clifts along the Water-Edge; that Way &s;eemed im|pa&s;&s;able, the Mountain &s;teep and difficult: However, our mournful Traveller con|cluded
<PB N="15" REF="019979_0015_0FAD483C49150AF0">
that the latter Way was the be&s;t. She therefore a&s;cended for &s;ome Time, but coming to a Range of inacce&s;&s;ible Rocks, &s;he turned her Cour&s;e towards the Mountain and the River-Side; after getting into a deep Gulley, and pa&s;&s;ing over &s;everal high &s;teep Rocks, &s;he rea|ched the River-Side, where to her inex|pre&s;&s;ible Affliction, &s;he found that a per|pendicular Rock, or rather one that hung over, of Fifteen or Twenty Feet high, formed the Bank. Here a &s;olemn Pau&s;e took Place; &s;he e&s;&s;ayed to return, but the Height of the &s;teep Rocks &s;he had de&s;cended over prevented her. She then returned to the Edge of the Precipice, and viewed the Bottom of it as the cer|tain Place to end all her Troubles, or remain on the Top to pine away with Hunger, or be devoured by wild Bea&s;ts. After &s;erious Meditation, and devout Ex|erci&s;es, &s;he determined on leaping from the Height, and accordingly jumped off. Although the Place &s;he had to alight on, was covered with uneven Rocks, not a Bone was broken; but being exceeding-&s;tunned with the Fall, &s;he remained un|able to proceed for &s;ome Space of Time.
<PB N="16" REF="019979_0016_0FAD483D24C23B88">
The dry Sea&s;on cau&s;ed the River to be &s;hallow&mdash;&s;he travelled in it, where &s;he could, by its Edge, until &s;he got through the Mountain, which, &s;he concluded was &s;everal Miles. After this, as &s;he was travelling along the Bank of the River, a venomous Snake bit her on the Ankle: She had Strength to kill it, and knowing its Kind, concluded that Death mu&s;t &s;oon, overtake her. By this time Mrs. <HI>Scott</HI> was reduced to a mere Skeleton, with Fatigue, Hunger and Grief; pro|bably this State of her Body was the Means of pre&s;erving her from the Ef|fects of the Poi&s;on; be that as it may, &s;o it was, that very little Pain &s;uceeeded the Bite, and what little Swelling there was fell into her Feet.</P>
<P>Our Wanderer now left the River, and after proceeding a good Di&s;tance, &s;he came to where the Valley parted into two, each leading a different Cour&s;e. Here a painful Su&s;pen&s;e again took Place: A forlorn Creature almo&s;t exhau&s;ted and certain, if &s;he was far led out of the Way, &s;he &s;hould never &s;ee a human Creature. During this Soliloquy, a

beautiful Bird pa&s;&s;ed clo&s;e by her, flutter|ing along the Ground, and went out of Sight up one of the Vallies. This drew her Attention, and whil&s;t con&s;idering what it might mean, another Bird of the &s;ame Appearance, flattered pa&s;t her, and took the &s;ame Valley the other had done. This determined her Choice of the Way; and, in two Days, which was on the Eleventh Day of Augu&s;t, &s;he reached that Settlement on <HI>Clinch</HI> called <HI>New-Garden</HI>: Whereas (&s;he has &s;ince been informed by Woods-Men) had &s;he taken the other Valley, it would have led her back to the <HI>Ohio.</HI> Mrs. <HI>Scott</HI> relates, that the Indians told her, that the Party was compo&s;ed of four different Na|tions, two of whom &s;he thinks they nam|ed <HI>Delawares</HI> and <HI>Mingoes.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="019979_0018_0FAD483EABB15D20">She further relates, that, wandering from the Tenth of July to the Eleventh of Augu&s;t, &s;he had no other Sub&s;i&s;tence but chewing and &s;wallowing the Juice of young Cane-Stalks, Sa&s;&s;afras-Leaves, and &s;ome other Plants &s;he did not know the Name of; that, on her Journey, &s;he &s;aw Buffaloes, Serpents, Elks, Deers, and frequently Bears and Wolves; not one of which offered her the lea&s;t Harm. One Day a Bear came near her, with a young Fawn in his Mouth, and, on di&s;covering her, he dropped his Prey and run off. Hunger prompted her to go and take the Fle&s;h and eat it; but, on Re|flection, &s;he de&s;i&s;ted, thinking the Bear might return and devour her: Be&s;ides, &s;he had an Aver&s;ion to ta&s;te raw Fle&s;h.&mdash; Mrs. <HI>Scott</HI> continues in a low State of Health, and remains incon&s;olable for the Lo&s;s of her Family, particularly be|wailing the cruel Death of her little Daughter.</P>

<P><PB N="20" REF="019979_0020_0FAD4840066C3DC8">I Was taken Pri&s;oner about fifty Miles to the We&s;tward of <HI>Fort-Pitt,</HI> about Eighteen Years ago, by the Indians, and carried away by them to the <HI>Waba&s;h,</HI> with many more White Men, who were execut|ed with Circum&s;tances of horrid Barbarity; it was my good Fortune to call forth the Sympathy of what is called the Good Wo|man of the Town, who was permitted to redeem me from the Flames, by giving, as my Ran&s;om, a Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>After remaining two Years in Bondage among&s;t the Indians, a <HI>Spaniard</HI> came to the Nation, having been &s;ent from <HI>Mexico</HI> on Di&s;coveries. He made Application to the Chiefs for redeeming me, and another White Man who was in a like Situation, a Native of <HI>Wales,</HI> named <HI>John Davey</HI>; which they complied with, and we took our Departure in Company with the <HI>Spa|niard,</HI> and travelled to the We&s;tward, cro&s;|&s;ing the <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi,</HI> near the <HI>River-Rouge,</HI> or <HI>Red-River,</HI> up which we travelled &s;e|ven Hundred Miles, when we came to a Na|tion of Indians remarkable white, and who&s;e Hair was of a redi&s;h Colour, at lea&s;t mo&s;tly &s;o; they lived on the Banks of a &s;mall River that empties it&s;elf into the <HI>Red River,</HI> which is called the <HI>River-Po&s;t.</HI> In the Morning of the Day after our Arrival among the&s;e Indians, the <HI>Welchman</HI> infor|med
<PB N="21" REF="019979_0021_0FAD4840C5ACF508">
me that he determined to tarry with them, giving as a Rea&s;on that he under|&s;tood their Language, it being very little different from the <HI>Welch.</HI> My Curio&s;ity was excited very much by this Informa|tion, and I went with my Companion to the Chief Men of the Town, who inform|ed him (in a Language that I had no Knowledge of, and which had no Affinity to that of any other Indian Tongue that I ever heard) that the Forefathers of this Nation came from a Foreign Country, and landed on the Ea&s;t-Side of the <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi,</HI> de&s;cribing particularly the Country now called <HI>We&s;t-Florida,</HI> and that on the <HI>Spani|ards</HI> taking Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Mexico,</HI> they fled to their then abode; and, as a Proof of the Truth of what they advanced, they bro't forth Rolls of Parchment carefully tied up in Otter-Skins, on which were large Cha|racters written with blue Ink; the Charac|ters I did not under&s;tand, and the <HI>Welch|man</HI> being unacquained with Letters, even of his own Language, I was not able to know the Meaning of the Writing. They were a bold, hardy, intrepid People, very warlike, and the Women beautiful, when compared with other Indians.</P>
<P>We left this Nation, after being kindly treated, and reque&s;ted to remain among&s;t them, being only two in Number, the

<HI>Spaniard</HI> and my&s;elf, and we continued our Cour&s;e up the Waters of the <HI>Red-River,</HI> until we came to a Nation of Indians, cal|led <HI>Windots,</HI> that had never &s;een a White Man before, and who were unacquainted with the U&s;e of Fire-Arms. On our Way we came to a tran&s;parent Stream, which we, to our great Surpri&s;e, found to de|&s;cend into the Earth, and, at the Foot of a Ridge of Mountains, di&s;appeared; it was remarkable clear, and near to it we found the Bones of two Animals, of &s;uch a Size that a Man might walk under the Ribs, and the Teeth were very heavy.</P>
<P>The Nation of Indians that had never &s;een a White Man, lived near the Source of the <HI>Red-River,</HI> and there the <HI>Spaniard</HI> di&s;covered to his great Joy, Gold-Du&s;t in the Brooks and Rivulets, and being infor|med by the Indians that a Nation lived further We&s;t, who were very rich, and who&s;e Arrows were pointed with Gold, we &s;et out in hope of reaching their Country, and we travelled about five Hundred Miles until we came to a Ridge of Mountains, which we cro&s;&s;ed, and from which the Streams run due We&s;t, and at the Foot of the Mountains the <HI>Spaniard</HI> gave Proofs of Joy and great Satisfaction, having found Gold in great Abundance. I was not ac|quainted with the Nature of the Ore, but
