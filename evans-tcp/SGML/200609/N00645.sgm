<BIBL><HI>Isaiah</HI> V. I, 2.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>Now will I sing to my well beloved a song to my beloved, touching his vineyard; my well-beloved hath a Vineyard in a very fruitful hill.</HI></Q>
<Q>2. <HI>And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones there|of, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also made a wine press therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes; and it brought forth wild grapes.</HI> I principally scope at the last words.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THis Great Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> was one whom God Raised up, and Endowed with a Spirit of Prophecy above most in those days: And as to foretel Christ the Messias coming, and other Accom|complish.
<PB REF="000784_0003_0FAA497EA7103E80">
<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> wayes, and from the Purity of his Worship, wherein their Godly Fore-fathers walked in former dayes; when God planted them a Noble Vine, and was the Glory in the midst of them; and as a Wall of fire round a|bout them for their defence.</P>
<P>Of whose woful degeneracy as the Lord com|plains by this Prophet; <HI>Chapter</HI> the first, <HI>ver.</HI> 2, 3. and <HI>chap.</HI> 3. and other places; so he makes the like sad complaint by that mournful Prophet <HI>Jeremy, chap.</HI> 2. <HI>v.</HI> 1. as you may see there; also by <HI>Ezekiel</HI> and others of his Prophets. But now to stop a little before I proceed; may not the Lord justly make the like sad complaint of the lamentable Degeneracy of his People in these Dayes; and that with far greater and more grie|vous Aggravations thereof than that People were chargeable with; for we especially in <HI>New En|gland</HI> have been brought up under greater and more glorious Light than they. They were trained up under mysterious Types and Shadows, only pointing at Christ to come; but we under clear Gospel Light in the Accomplishment; <HI>Christ manifested in the Flesh, seen of Angels, believed on in the world, received up to Glory,</HI> whose Second Co|ming we expect and hope for e're long.</P>
<P>And yet notwithstanding we have in our first times been thus planted a Noble Vine; alas!
<PB N="5" REF="000784_0004_0FAA497F70BA9430">
have we not brought forth wild or sower Grapes, bad fruit, made evil Returns to the Lord after all the great things God has done for us, especi|ally in our Primitive Times.</P>
<P>And whereas in these latter dayes God for our Correction and Amendment hath (as we know) visited and smitten us with awful and wasting Judgments from year to year. Yet is it not ma|nifest, that we in this, and the Rising Generation grow worse and worse; so that God may justly plead with us as he did with this People, <HI>Isa.</HI> 1. 5 <HI>Why should ye be smitten any more, you will Revolt more and more;</HI> wherein the Lord (in effect) doth charge them with Incorrigibleness, under long continued Corrective Judgments as Ripe or Ripening for Desolation, which indeed accor|dingly hastened upon them; first, by the Baby|lonish Seventy Years Captivity, wherein a Rem|nant was preserved. And finally by the <HI>Romish</HI> Desolation to this Day.</P>
<P>And truly these things considered, we have cause to fear and tremble to think what God may do with this Sinful and Degenerate Age and Generation wherein-we live.</P>
<P>The Lord prepare us.</P>
<P>But to proceed:</P>
<P>First from the whole of the Parable, the <HI>Ob|servation</HI> is,</P>
<P><HI>That when God has planted a Nation or People in their First Times or Infancy, upon good foundations
<PB N="6" REF="000784_0005_0FAA49809B9B2380">
of Gospel Light and means of Grace, and that un|der his Divine Protection and Culture, he expects they should bring forth the fruit of all in Piety, Godliness, and growth of Religion and Holiness.</HI></P>
<P>Observ. 2. <HI>That when such a People so Planted, do universally Degenerate and Backslide from the Pri|milive Purity and Godliness of their Fore fathers and Ancestors, and Sin and Iniquity does abound, notwithstanding Gospel Light, and Means of Grace still continued to them for their Instruction in Re|ligion; and Fatherly Chastisements from God in|flicted upon them for their Correction and Amend|ment, God is highly provoked thereby, and may justly complain of them as Unteachable and Incorri|gible.</HI></P>
<P>Observ. 3. <HI>That such a People are Ripe or Ripening for Desolating Judgments, if they do not speedily Repent, Reform and turn to God.</HI></P>
<P>Of the first Observation the Summe is, That when God has planted a People in their first times on foundations of Religion and Piety, he expects they should bring forth the fruit thereof answerably; themselves, and their Posterity.</P>
<P>For proof and illustration whereof.</P>
<P N="1">1. Some Scriptures. 2. Some Reasons. 3. Some Application for our Improvement.</P>
<P N="1">1. For proof; not only the Parable it self does clearly infer it, the whole of Gods Planting and Cultivation of that People as his Vineyard doth fully prove it, as I shall further demonstrate when I come to particulars.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="000784_0006_0FAA49811E1A4C80">
But this expectation of Fruitfulness may be also gathered from Isa. 1. 2. <HI>Hear O Heavens, and give ear O Earth, for the Lord hath spoken it: I have nourished and brought up Children, and they have Rebelled against me.</HI> God calls the Inhabi|tants of Heaven, the Angels above, and the Inha|bitants of the Earth, men below to consider (as 'twere) of the matter; what he might justly expect having so nourished and brought up Chil|dren: What to Rebel against him? to prove Re|bellious at last; sure that is an evil return, and both Heaven and Earth will testifie against such a sinful and ungrateful People.</P>
<P>Now you that are Parents; if your Children whom you have nourished and well brought up, should prove rebellious against you, you would surely cry out against them, and justly too, and greatly lament the disappointment of your hopes.</P>
<P>Why thus God himself does (as you have heard) when his Children or People whom he had nourished and brought up, proved rebellious and Degenerate, as that people did in future Ge|nerations. So further, what a sad complaint the Lord makes against this People, <HI>Jer.</HI> 2. 10. <HI>I had planted thee a noble Vine; How then art thou turned into the Degenerate Plant of a strange vine unto me?</HI> Again, <HI>Hos.</HI> 11. 7. <HI>My people are bent to Backsliding from me: though they called them to the most High, none at all would exalt him.</HI> Again, <HI>Hos.</HI> 10. 1. <HI>Is|rael is an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="000784_0007_0FAA4981E573C4C0">
In the next place I shall lay down some Rea|sons why God may expect suitable and answera|ble fruitfulness from the Vineyard of his Profes|sing People.</P>
<P>And therein first, I shall refer to Gods Aunci|ent <HI>Israel,</HI> to shew what great things God did for them, then consider what God hath done for us in Allusion thereunto.</P>
<P N="1">1. God did much for that People in the great cost and pains (as I may say) he was at in his Planting and Cultivation of them to make them his Vineyard and fruitful Inheritance.</P>
<P>To which end First, From his Soveraign Grace and free mercy, he singled them out, and separa|ted them from the rest of Mankind lost in the First <HI>Adam.</HI> Thus he did with <HI>Abraham,</HI> Gen. 15. 1. <HI>I am the Lord that brought thee out of</HI> Ur <HI>of the Chaldees to give thee this Land.</HI> Whereby we see the Lord separated <HI>Abraham</HI> from a Heathen People, to lay the foundation of his Church first in his Family, and afterwards in his Posterity; which continued (as we know) to the Coming of the Promised Messias Jesus Christ, whom they then Rejected, and were therefore Rejected themselves to this day.</P>
<P N="2">2. God might justly expect such fruitfulness from that People, from the high Obligation he laid upon them, in giving them his Divine Laws, Statutes and Judgments for their Instruction and Education in Grace, and holy Obedience, as 'tis said, <HI>Psal.</HI> 147. 19,20. <HI>He shewed his word unto
<PB N="9" REF="000784_0008_0FAA498263F91370">
Jacob, his Statutes and Judgments unto Israel; he hath not dealt so with any Nation.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. God might justly expect fruitfulness of that his People and Vineyard, in consideration of the light and means of grace afforded them in his Publick Worship and Ordinances for their spiri|tual growth, to ripen them for Eternal Glory.</P>
<P N="4">4. God might justly expect such fruitfulness of that his People, from his further Cultivation of them by his fatherly Chastisements of them for their recovery and amendment when they sinned against him; and this according to his Covenant Faithfulness, as promised, Psal. 89. 30,31,32. <HI>If this Children for sake my Law, I will chastise them,</HI> &amp;c. I shall now proceed to make some Im|provement of what hath been said.</P>
<P N="1">1. With Reflection upon our selves in these times. 2. For Humiliation. 3. Exhortation.</P>
<P N="1">1. For Information and Reflection.</P>
<P>Hath the Lord in former dayes Planted his People in this Wilderness to be his Vineyard: Pray let us seriously consider what steps he took to bring about that great work, in a very near similitude to what he did for his <HI>Israel</HI> of old.</P>
<P N="1">1. He brought them (as we know) out of <HI>Egyptian</HI> Bondage; the sore Oppression and Per|secution they underwent there, as the Holy Scrip|ture fully declares; so 'tis said, Exod. 20. 2. <HI>I am the Lord thy God that brought thee out of the Land of Egypt out of the House of Bondage.</HI> And of this also the Lord minds them again, <HI>Deut.</HI> 6. 11,12.
<PB N="10" REF="000784_0009_0FAA498519C8D480">
<HI>When thou art full then beware lest thou forget the Lord which brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, from the House of Bondage.</HI></P>
<P>Now may not this be said in a parallel sense of the first Generation of our Godly Fathers and Ancestors. For although God did not bring them out or an <HI>Egyptian</HI> Heathen Land, rather a plea|sant and desirable Country, yet considering the sore Persecution of the Saints and Servants of God in these times, they might be truly said to be brought out of the house of bondage; <HI>Israel</HI>'s Bondage was outward chiefly; but there's a Conscience Bondage, and that is the sorest, and that with great &amp; heavy outward Sufferings too</P>
<P N="2">2. The second step of Divine Power and Pro|vidence towards that People of <HI>Israel</HI> was, that he led them through the Red Sea, by his mighty power made a way for them, which else had stopt and discouraged them, as tis said, <HI>Exod.</HI> 15. 19. <HI>the Children of Israel went on dry Land through the midst of the Sea.</HI> Thus the Lord brought his People over the great Atlantick Ocean, (said to be the greatest in the World) and that with most remarkable safety in those days; so to plant them his Vineyard in this Wilderness.</P>
<P N="3">3. The third step of Divine Dispensation to|wards and for that People was, that God did cast out the Heathen to make room for them, as Psal, 80. 8. <HI>thou hast cast out the Heathen, and planted it,</HI> &amp;c. So the Lord to make room for his People, and for their greater safety cast out the
<PB N="11" REF="000784_0010_0FAA498711DD1308">
Heathen in great numbers, by sore sickness and mortality in those times; and since diminisht them much by the Sword or War. This was as in the Parable to gather out the Stones for the Planting of his Vineyard.</P>
<P N="4">4. The fourth step of Divine Dispensation to|wards that People, the Lord set up a Rich and costly and glorious Tabernacle for his Worships according to the Pattern given to <HI>Moses</HI> in the Mount, with the Ark of the Testimony or Co|venant; all mystically and typically pointing at Christ their promised Messias, to build them up, and establish them in Religion and Godliness; and to prepare them for Entrance and Settlement in that Typical <HI>Canaan:</HI> And thereunto they might not add any Invention of their own, nor alter a pin of that Sanctuary.</P>
<P>So the Lord at first planting of his Vineyard in this Land in the days of our Fore fathers, he Settled Evangelical Churches according to the Pattern in the Mount, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Christ's Institutions given forth by his holy Apostles in those Primi|tive Times of the Gospel without respect to Humane Traditions as the Inventions of men.</P>
<P N="5">5. The fifth step of Divine Dispensation to|wards that People: He gave them Laws and Ordinances, the Moral and Ceremonial Law for their enlightning and instruction in the Will of God, and for direction in his Worship, to make them fruitful in Holiness, and to Ripen them for the Spiritual and Eternal Canaan, as 'tis <HI>Neh</HI> 9.
<PB N="12" REF="000784_0011_0FAA4987B3BF5850">
14 <HI>thou madest known to them thy Holy-Sabbath, and Commandest them Statutes and Laws,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>So the Lord was pleased to settle his Churches in <HI>New-England</HI> in those first times with pure Worship and Ordinances of his own Institution &amp; Appointment in his Word, to prepare &amp; ripen them for Eternal Life and Glory.</P>
<P N="6">6. The sixth step: The Lord built a Tower in the midst of that his Vineyard for their Pro|tection and Defence. And by that we may un|derstand the Civil Government settled among them by Judges, for preservation of good Order, Righteousness and Peace, and they qualified ac|cording to <HI>Jethro's</HI> counsel to <HI>Moses;</HI> men fearing God, men of truth, hating Coveteousness. And was it not thus in our first times; the then Ru|lers were wise and godly Worthies of our <HI>Israel,</HI> however too slightly thought of by too many of this Generation.</P>
<P N="7">7. The seventh step of Divine Providence to|wards Gods Ancient <HI>Israel</HI> was with respect to their protection and defence against their forreign Enemies; for whilst they continued to be his Glory, God was a Defence to them, as promised, <HI>Isa.</HI> 4. 5. <HI>And the Lord will create upon every dwel|ling place in Mount Sion, and upon her Assemblies, a Cloud and Smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night, for upon all the Glory shall be a Defence.</HI></P>
<P>To this purpose also that promise, <HI>Psal.</HI> 141. 2. <HI>As the Mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his People from henceforth even
<PB N="13" REF="000784_0012_0FAA498894B14D60">
for even</HI> Also <HI>Zeeh.</HI> 2. 5. And was it not thus with Gods people in <HI>New-England</HI> in our first times; was not the Lord as a Wall of Fire round about them, and their Defence against all Ene|mies at home and abroad, so that no weapon, council or device prospered against them in those days, as 'tis well known. But alas, alas! has not the Lord comparatively forsaken us in these days, and justly too, because we have forsaken him.</P>
<P N="8">8. The eighth step observable may be with re|spect to Gods Dispensations towards that People in after-times, For when they began to Dege|nerate from God and his ways, which was in a gradual manner, God was pleased for their Cor|rection and Amendment, gradually to visit them with Corrections and Chastisments for their Re|formation and Recovery. Of this the Lord gave them warning, <HI>Deut</HI> 31. 16,17. Read the summ: <HI>If they forsake, I will forsake them,</HI> &amp;c. and as 'tis <HI>Psal.</HI> 89. <HI>visit their transgressions with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.</HI> And thus the Lord did when they degenerated from him, as we may see, <HI>Amos</HI> 4. 6. <HI>I gave you cleanness of teeth in all your Cities, and want of bread in all your places; yet have you not returned unto me.</HI> v. 9. <HI>I have smitten you with blastings and mildews, and palmer worms,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>yet have you not returned unto me.</HI> Yea, v. 10. 'tis further said, that God sent the Pestilence a|mong them, and the Sword, and Burnings; yet the Lord goes on with the same Complaint: Yet have you not Returned unto me,</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="000784_0013_0FAA49892CD36720">
And now pray let us solemnly consider: Is not this our case? Hath not the Lord thus awfully dispensed towards us for many years past, and to this day in a great measure? Have we not seen and felt many of these Judgments of God in this Land; blastings, mildews, worms, shortnings of our Bread Corn, Sickness, Mortality, Sword, Burnings add the like, though not so universally as upon that People.</P>
<P>But for all these sore Chastisements, where is our Reformation and Returning to God: May not the Lord make the same Complaint against us as against them: <HI>Yet have you not returned unto me;</HI> yea and say of us as of them, <HI>Isa</HI> 1. <HI>Hear O Heavens, and give ear, O Earth, I have nourished and brought up a people in</HI> New England, <HI>and they have Rebelled against me. I had planted thee,</HI> O New-En|gland, <HI>a noble vine, how art thou then degenerated in|to the plant of a strange vine unto me?</HI> But to go on with a further account about that People.</P>
<P N="9">9. The Lord seeing that instead of being Re|formed by his Word and Judgments, they grow worse and worse, and so proved incorrigible; it put him (as 'twere) to a stand what to do, as we may find in the Parable, <HI>Isa</HI> 5. 3,4. <HI>And now O Inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judg I pray you betwixt me and my Vineyard; what could have been done more, that I have not done? when I looked it should bring forth Grapes, it brought forth sower Grapes.</HI></P>
<P>Now the Lord having thus Expostulated with
<PB N="15" REF="000784_0014_0FAA498A1F88C100">
them for their unfruitfulness under all his Cultivations of them by the means of Grace, ha|ving afforded them his divine approbation against Enemies. And at last visited them for their de|generacy by his fatherly Chastisements; and they still proving unfruitful and incorrigible notwith|standing; the Lord being by all put to a stand what to do with such a People, resolves the que|stion himself, <HI>v.</HI> 5,6,7. that is in short, he would even give them up and lay them wast (only as we know God had his Elect Ones whom he preserved even in Babylon) And then in the sequel of that Chapter, beginning <HI>v</HI> 8. so <HI>v.</HI> 11,18,20,21,22. the Lord denounces woes to them; Wo, Wo, Wo, six times successively: A series of Woes accomplisht in awful wasting, de|solating Judgments.</P>
<P>And to the same purpose the Lord threatned them for their Impenitency and Incorrigibleness, with sore and desolating Judgments by others of his Prophets, as we may see in <HI>Amos</HI> 3. And then proceeds to the Execution of them, <HI>chap</HI> 4. verse 12. tell, them plainly: <HI>Thus will I do unto thee, O Israel, and because I will do this, prepare to meet thy God O Israel.</HI> And then follows a mournful la|mentation for them by that Prophet, <HI>chap</HI> 5. 1,2,3.</P>
<P>In the next place I shall further and more par|ticularly Apply and Improve all to our selves.</P>
<P>And therefore first, Let it be for Examination.</P>
<P>You have heard what Gods Dispensations were towards his Ancient <HI>Israel</HI> of old; and the evil
<PB N="16" REF="000784_0015_0FAA498B381B76E0">
returns they made, and the sad and doleful issue of all. Let us then (I say) come home to our selves Gods Professing People in this Wilderness. O let us seriously reflect, comparing former dayes with our times.</P>
<P>May not the Lord take up, and justly improves this Parable against us, as well as against them in every step of his Dispensations towards us from our very first beginning. As in affording us such Gospel Light, Liberties and Priviledges above any other people in those times; giving us his pure Worship &amp; Ordinances, buildings up his Mount Sion and Jerusalem in the midst of us in Evangeli|cal Churches; and therein the platform of his Spiritual Kingdom in our primitive times, beyond what was to be found in all the Earth; all things considered.</P>
<P>But I pray let us consider what fruit have we brought forth to his Glory, good grapes or rather sower grapes from one end of the Land to the other in these times.</P>
<P>If so, let it be for a Lamentation.</P>
<P>Ah! how well may the Lord complain of us, as he did of that his Ancient <HI>Israel,</HI> Jer. 2. 21. <HI>I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed; How then art thou turned into the Degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?</HI> see also <HI>ver.</HI> 31,32.</P>
<P N="3">3. Let the next Improvement be for Humilia|tion: If ever any people had cause to humble themselves in Sackcloth and Ashes before the Lord under the sense of their woful Degeneracy,
<PB N="17" REF="000784_0016_0FAA498C167E77F8">
and Gods awful wasting Judgments we have been long under, and still are; surely we have.</P>
<P>And to quicken us thereunto, as also, to humble, earnest and fervent prayers and supplication for mercy; see 2 Chron. 7. 14. <HI>If my people which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways: then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their Land.</HI> O that it were so indeed with us.</P>
<P>But alas! alas! instead of humbling our selves, which God calls to, and that in Sackcloth and Ashes, as <HI>Isa.</HI> 22. 12. Behold other things, the su|perabounding of Pride and Vanity, Fantastick Attire and Ornaments, monstrous Head-Towers, and other antick Dresses: And many other God|provoking, and Land destroying, yea, and Soul|destroying sins which the Lord condemns and threatens, <HI>Isa.</HI> 3. 13, to 24. and many other places.</P>
<P N="4">4. And lastly to conclude all with a word or two for Exhortation and Counsel to this Genera|tion. Seeing our sins and degeneracy have pro|voked God to follow us so long, and that to this day with woful judgments, and threaten us fur|ther, for our incorrigibleness (if we do not repent and turn) even with Desolation.</P>
<P>Let us therefore say in our hearts, and one to another, (and O that it might be so throughout the Land) as the Prophet <HI>Hosea</HI> did in his Exhortation to that people, <HI>Hos.</HI> 6. 1. <HI>Come and let us Re|turn unto the Lord, for he hath torn, and he will heal
<PB N="18" REF="000784_0017_0FAA498C26BF5790">
as, he hath smitten and he will bind us up,</HI> &amp;c. And then he promises further, he will Revive us, and we shall live in his sight. Thus (I say) Let us call one upon another, Come, Come, O Come, Let us return unto the Lord, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But you may say, How shall we Return?</P>
<P>I answer by sincere and serious Humiliation, thorow Reformation, and restless wrestling pray|er, in the name, and through the Mediation of Jesus Christ our Advocate and Intercessor in Hea|ven: And then we may hope that for his sake the Lord will make good that gracious promise before-mentioned, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 14. to hear us from Heaven, forgive our sins, and heal our Land; And so be gracious to the Remnant of his <HI>Jo|seph,</HI> as 'tis promised, <HI>Amos</HI> 5. 15.</P>
<P>But if we Return not, then we have cause to fear those Repeated Woes denounced against Gods Ancient <HI>Israel</HI> aforesaid, <HI>Isa.</HI> 5. &amp;c. will be our sad portion at last.</P>
<P>O therefore let us follow God with prayer, together and apart, That he would have mer|cy upon his <HI>Israel,</HI> the Remnant of his <HI>Joseph</HI> in this Land, and in other parts of the World in this dark and gloomy Day.</P>

<P N="1">1. We have an account of the Churches di|stressed and afflicted State, <HI>v</HI> 9. to 17. <HI>Thou hast cast off, and put us to shame: and goest not forth with our Armies. Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate us spoil for themselves,</HI> vers. 11. <HI>Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat: and hast scattered us among the heathen.</HI> v. 12. <HI>Thou sellest thy people for nought, and doest not increase thy wealth by their price. Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us. Thou makest us a by word among the heathen: a shaking of the head among the people,</HI> &amp;c. And so goes on with a sorrowful complaint of their doleful condition and sufferings.</P>
<P>Now when it was that this People of God were in, and under such sad Dispensations as if forsaken of God, and cast off as they complain, is hard to say. But probably it was in the time of the Babylonish Captivity. But I shall leave it.</P>
<P>Only before I proceed, I pray let us solemnly and seriously consider whether it is not thus with us in a great measure in <HI>New England</HI> at least threatned. Have we not cause to complain that God in a great measure hath (as 'twere) cast us off and forsaken us. What is the meaning else of that great Wrath of God against us? in giv|ing up so many of our fellow Christians from time to time unto the cruel hands of the Barba|rous Heathen, professed Worshippers of the De|vil; to letting (as 'twere) Hell loose against us.
<PB N="21" REF="000784_0020_0FAA498EE4852EA0">
If we are not sensible of it, God will make us sensible of it before he has done with us, as he did this people; that we, as they shall in like manner mournfully complain before him.</P>
<P>Now the sad complaint this people here make of their afflicted state, is greatly aggavated in their calling to mind what great things God did for their Fathers in former days, as you may see from <HI>v.</HI> 1. to 9. <HI>We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what work thou didst in their days, in the times of old</HI> v. 2 <HI>How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst them; how thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out.</HI> v. 3. <HI>For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them</HI> And then he goes on with prayer, to make way for the following complaints of their sorrows and sufferings, notwithstanding those great things God had done for their fathers.</P>
<P>And now I pray you, may we not rightly and truly in every particular say as these do: That we have heard with our ears, and our fathers have told us, what great things God did do for them in those first times, when God planted them as his Vineyard, in His first <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> pure Evangelical Churches in <HI>New-England;</HI> and to that end cast out the Heathen, at least diminisht their great numbers; and all this God did by his right hand, and Arm of his power, and the light of his coun|tenance,
<PB N="22" REF="000784_0021_0FAA498F587AD0B0">
because he had a favour unto them, was with them, and their defence and glory in those times But now as to us their Posterity and Suc|cessors in these days: Alas! we may sadly say; <HI>But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame, and goest not forth with our Armies;</HI> and so throughout to the end of that Lamentation.</P>
<P>And thus I have mentioned the distresses of that ancient <HI>Israel</HI> of God in those days; as also our own sorrowful State in these times parallel therewith, as if it had been pen'd for us in <HI>New-England</HI> as well as for them; and so we ought to apply and improve it.</P>
<P N="2">2. In the next place, which is most remarka|ble, we have the Churches gracious frame of Spi|rit, and Integrity under all these distresses and af|flictions they had complained of; say they, <HI>All this is come upon us, yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy Covenant.</HI> v. 18. <HI>Our heart is not turned back: neither have our steps declined from thy way.</HI> v. 19. <HI>Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.</HI> And see on v. 20,21,22.</P>
<P N="3">3. And then that afflicted Church goes on with most affectionate argumentative prayer for Gods favour, that he would deliver them for his Mer|cies sake, as in the 4 last verses of the Psalm at first mentioned. Although this prayer was the principal thing I had my eye upon, and unto which the many distressing Dispensations of God towards us calls us to, even throughout the Land,
<PB N="23" REF="000784_0022_0FAA499038467A98">
yet I shall wave at present, and proceed:</P>
<P>Let us then for our solemn consideration, com|pare the present state and condition of the People of God in these times, especially our own in this part of the World, with what we find here ex|prest concerning that ancient Church and People of <HI>Israel</HI> in those days. <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P N="1">1. Their afflictions and sufferings. 2. Their frame of spirit and behaviour under all, for our reflection and awakening in these sleepy times.</P>
<P N="1">1. For the suffering part, having glanced upon that already, I shall not further insist upon it, it being so obvious to every seeing eye, yea, every ear in all places throughout the Land may hear the doleful complaints that are made of our pub|lick Calamities, fears and distresses from the Righ|teous Judgment of God wherewith we have been followed for many years past, and still are.</P>
<P>And doubtless the memorial of the great things God did for our Fathers and Ancestors, lest upon Record for us, cannot but be a sore aggravation of our sins, and just sufferings in these declining and degenerate times.</P>
<P>But secondly &amp; principally: Let us solemnly see this peoples gracious frame of spirit under all their afflictions and calamities here complained of; and see whether it be so with us, whether we can tru|ly say, and acquit our selves before the Lord, and to him as they did: And for our close reflection, we will come to particulars by way of Enquiry.</P>
<P N="1">1. Can we say as they do, <HI>v.</HI> 17. <HI>All this is
<PB N="24" REF="000784_0023_0FAA4990A1DC51D8">
come upon us, yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.</HI> v. 18. <HI>Our heart is not turned back: neither have our steps declined from thy way,</HI> &amp;c. If we say it is so with us, I may Re|ply, or rather God may say to us as <HI>Samuel</HI> did to <HI>Saul,</HI> 1 Sam. 15. 14. <HI>What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the Oxen which I hear?</HI></P>
<P>Let us therefore (I say) more distinctly consi|der the particulars of the solemn profession this people here make; and they do it to God himself, which is an awful thing.</P>
<P N="1">1. Say they, after all this that is come upon us, yet have we not forgotten thee. Now pray con|sider, Can we, or dare we say as they do? That we have not forgotten God in sundry respects; or rather may not the Lord justly say to us as to Backsliding <HI>Israel</HI> of old, <HI>Jer.</HI> 2. 31,32. <HI>O genera|tion, see ye the word of the Lord: have I been a wil|derness unto Israel? a land of darkness? wherefore say my people, we are Lords, we will come no more unto thee?</HI> v. 32. <HI>Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? Yet my people have forgotten me days without number.</HI> Pray consider whether this for|getfulness of God may not be found among us in this Wilderness in sundry respects? I shall menti|on some. As</P>
<P N="1">1. Have we not too much forgotten the Design and Ends of our Fore-fathers coming into this Wilderness, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Religion and Godliness, with the purity of Gods Worship and Ordinances: If we
<PB N="25" REF="000784_0024_0FAA499417C41758">
say we do not forget; then let me say, that is an aggravation of our sin if we be found to pursue another Interest, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> the World (for I know, that Religion was the Foundation Interest of <HI>New England</HI> in their first settlement here both in Church and Common-wealth. But is the World in a great measure has crouded out that, God sees it, whether we see it or not, which was of awful consideration to this People the Psalmist speaks of; say they, <HI>v.</HI> 20. <HI>If we have forgotten the Name of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god:</HI> v. 21. <HI>Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.</HI> And there|fore may not the Lord lay this Sin of Worldli|ness to <HI>New-England</HI>s Charge, as he did to his de|generate people of old, <HI>Jer.</HI> 6. 13. in the prece|dent verses of that Chapter, God had threatned them with sore Judgments; and that therein he would stretch out his hand upon the whole land; and then in <HI>v.</HI> 13. he gives the reason of it, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> for from the least of them even to the greatest of them, every one is given to Coveteousness.</P>
<P>And 'twas for this sin of Worldliness that the Lord was wroth with and smote <HI>Ephraim,</HI> Isa. 57. 17. <HI>For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth and smote him: I hid me, &amp; was wroth, &amp; he went on frowardly in the way of his heart.</HI> And 'tis from this root of all evil, as the Apostle calls it, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">6.10. the love of money; that that gain of Oppres|sion arises, which fills the whole land; and for which sin the Lord threatned to lay his Vineyard
<PB N="26" REF="000784_0025_0FAA49956EC046E8">
waste, as <HI>Isa.</HI> 5. 6,7 Read the place. And if we are not as yet a Vineyard laid waste, assuredly we are by present and impending judgments laid open to it, and have cause to fear.</P>
<P N="2">2. Again, this afflicted people could say, Neither have we dealt falsely in thy Covenant. Now can we say so too? for we are Gods Covenant peo|ple as they were. Our Fathers in their first set|tling of Churches in <HI>New-England,</HI> did Covenant with God for themselves and their seed and Po|sterity, to walk with God, and to uphold his Wor|ship and Ordinances according to his revealed will in Gospel Institutions, without mixture of their own, or addition of Humane Inventions: And to maintain Communion of Saints in Church State, in purity and holiness, looking well to the entring in, and going forth of the Sanctuary; ac|cording to that charge, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 44. 5. The neglect whereof in bringing in the uncircumcised in heart and flesh, the Lord does charge as breach of his Covenant on that people. Now this was the ho|ly care of our Fore fathers in their time as 'tis well known. But have, and do we follow their Examples? if so, What is the meaning of the ma|nifest degeneracy of this Generation? very evi|dent, if we compare Churches and Church-members (many of them) and some of our now Ad|ministrations in practice and Discipline, with the way, practice and Discipline of Churches in those first times. Let the Rules of the Gospel left by Christ and his holy Apostles, (being the unaltera|ble
<PB N="27" REF="000784_0026_0FAA49966345B190">
Laws of his Spiritual Kingdom) determine and resolve the case; for all must be tryed and judged by those Divine Laws and Rules in the Great Day. But I desire rather to mourn in se|cret for these things, than to mention particu|lars, because I would not offend; yet let me say, that then at first the Churches were the Glory of Christ, and upon all the glory there was a de|fence, as promised, <HI>Isa.</HI> 4 5,6. And further, (I pray seriously mind it, and know, that according to the purity of Churches, hath been, and will be their Protection. But when once by their degeneracy they become as the outward Court-Worshippers (which some in these times incline to) they shall then be given to be trodden un|der foot of the Gentiles, (witness the once famous seven Churches of <HI>Asia</HI>) And if that in part be the condition of some Churches in this Land at this day, to be in danger of being destroyed by Antichristian and Heathen Enemies, we may ap|prehend the cause, and may well fear God has a Controversy even with his Churches, as well as the whole Body of this People.</P>
<P N="3">3. In the next place, can we say with this peo|ple: <HI>Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way.</HI> O that was a great <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">! whilst their heart kept right with God, they kept close to him in other things; but when that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> back from God, then they declined apace, and that in every thing. Now can we in these <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> say thus; Alas, alas! our wound lyes here; this
<PB N="28" REF="000784_0027_0FAA4996A7F850A8">
O this is the ground of the Apostacy of this age, of the degneracy of <HI>New England</HI> in this Genera|tion; our hearts are gone, and turned back from God, and from one another, as Christ has foretold of the last times. And hence it is that our steps are declined from his ways; the first &amp; best ways of the Churches of Christ, and of our godly fore|fathers in our primitive times. Let me explain and evince this is some particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. Do not our hearts go several ways herein; so this people had but one heart (as 'twere a|mong them all; for they do not say our hearts, but our <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> is not turned back. So in the Pri|mitive Times of the Gospel 'tis said <HI>Act.</HI> 2.4. there was singleness of heart, or one heart among them. And so it might be said of our First <HI>New-England.</HI> Churches. But now alas! it may be said of us, as the Lord complains of <HI>Israel, Hos.</HI> 10. 1,2. <HI>Their heart is divided, now shall they be found faulty.</HI></P>
<P>O I could say much of the sorrowful conse|quents of this heart division among Gods profes|sing people, when they began to decline in the other <HI>England,</HI> and that in my own time, and ob|servation there, which proved a sad in-let to their after changes and suffering in many respects.</P>
<P N="2">2. Again, Have we not left or lost our first love upon a Spiritual account. This the Lord Je|sus charges upon that shining Church of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> which out mined most of the Churches in our times, as you may see, <HI>Rev.</HI> 2. 1,2,3. And yet charged with this loss of first love; and therefore
<PB N="29" REF="000784_0028_0FAA49977A2E9B88">
threatned to be Unchurched, if they Repented not; see <HI>verse</HI> 4,5.</P>
<P>Now if it be found that we have left our first love to God, and one to another, and to the good ways of God our fore-fathers walked in. How far this threatning &amp; sentence may concern us, I shall leave-to solemn conside|ration: And say no more.</P>
<P N="3">3. Are we not in this Generation (at least too many) grown more lax, and large in our principles, yea and in practice also, then in the first times, and that in sundry respects. Indifferent about the things of God, if not lukewarm; the Evils charged upon the Churches of <HI>La|odicea</HI> and <HI>Sardis,</HI> as <HI>Rev.</HI> 3. 2,3. and 15,16.</P>
<P>Ah! how indifferent are most Christians in these times; can too easily give way to, and comply with new principles and practices in the things of God, without clear Scripture warrant. And what a lukewarm frame of Spirit as to Religion, may be found almost every where, so that we may fear the life &amp; power of Religion will wither &amp; dye away by degrees, if Christ revive it not.</P>
<P>For Lastly, Have we not in these times in a great mea|sure lost the power of Godliness both in heart and life; is so, 'tis no wonder that our steps are declined from his ways, for if heart godliness be gone, life godliness will quickly follow. Hence the Lord laid that Charge of old upon <HI>Abraham,</HI> Gen. 17. 1 <HI>I am God Almighty or Alsuffiicient, walk before me, and be thou upright.</HI> When once we grow in heart slight and formal in our Commu|nion and walking with God, we shall quickly grow slight in other respects: If we loose the life and power of god|liness in our hearts, we shall lose it also in our lives; and of and against this we are solemnly warned in these lat|ter days we are fallen into, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. 1,5. pray read the Text. We have cause greatly to mourn to see the Ac|complishment of what the Holy Apostle there foretells in
<PB N="30" REF="000784_0029_0FAA499844E37700">
so great a measure: The Lord help us to fear our selves, &amp; to watch and pray that we enter not into temptation; and so be carried away with the iniquity of the times.</P>
<P>Having thus spoken to the principal matters contained in this Psalm, in reference to the times we live in, for our reflection and awakening: That we may be stirred up to prepare to meet the Lord in the way of his Judgment, for he is surely come forth out of his place, to punish the Inhabitants of the Earth for their iniquity. I shall there|fore draw towards a conclusion; and only a few words further for Improvement of the whole.</P>
<P N="1">1. Then <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> we have been long, and still are an afflict|ed people in this Land, and cannot but say, unless we are asleep, or worse, penal<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">y hardened, as 'tis <HI>Isa.</HI> 9. 12. <HI>For all this his Anger is not turned away, but his hand is stret|ched out still.</HI> Then I say, let us humbly justify God in all, and judge our selves for this, see <HI>Neh. 9.</HI> 33. <HI>Thou art just in all that is come upon us, for thou hast done right but we have done wickedly;</HI> and <HI>Ezra</HI> 9 13. <HI>And after all this that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for our great trespasses, seeing that thou our God hast punisht us less than our Iniquities deserve.</HI></P>
<P>And surely great cause we have thus also to Justify God in the many woful, wasting, long continued and annually still increasing Judgments he hath followed us with to this day, considering that our Degeneracy from the first and best ways of his Covenant people in our primitive times, goes on and increaseth; and that Pride, Oppression and Profaness (too much connived at) seems to abound more and more, in all or most parts of the Land, as if we were already ripe, or ripening apace for an overflowing Scourge, or utter desolation, which the Lord in mercy prevent.</P>
<P>And yet though the by past, present and further threat|ned Judgments of God are very terrible, I am more a|fraid
<PB N="31" REF="000784_0030_0FAA4998E7C770F0">
of that word from God which he denounced against <HI>Ephraim</HI> of old, Hos. 4. 17. <HI>Ephraim is joined to Idols, let him alone.</HI> That degree of resolvedness in Degenera|cy does so manifestly appear among us, that fear and tremble, left the Lord should say of us, Let them alone. O for a people, or particular Soul to be let alone in their Sin, is a most dreadful thing, the sorest of Judg|ments, as we find it exprest, Psal. 81. 11, 12 <HI>My People would not hearken to my voice,</HI> &amp;c. They would not hear|ten to his voice, speaking to them by his Prophets, by his Word, and by his Judgments. God had been long speaking to them in all these ways, but still they would not hearken, and then follows: <HI>So I gave them up to their own hearts lusts, and they walked in their own coun|sels.</HI></P>
<P>And then verse 13. follows a sad Lamentation for them; God himself laments their case. <HI>O that my People had hearkened unto me, and Israel had waked in my ways.</HI> verse 14. <HI>I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their Adversaries.</HI></P>
<P>Now may not the Lord thus Lament over his Pro|fessing People in <HI>New-England;</HI> yea, and well he may. For surely had we hearkened to the Lords so long speaking to us by the Ministry of his Word, and by his Judgments, and walked in his ways accordingly, after the good Example of our Godly Fore-fathers; and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to the good Scriptural Foundations then laid in Church and Common wealth; the Lord would soon have subdued our Enemies, that are such a sore Scourge to us from year to year, and preserved us as he would have preserved that his Ancient <HI>Isra|el</HI> in those dayes, and not so follow (besides the present War) with such yearly wasting, Impoverish|ing and Famine threatning Judgments to this day.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="000784_0031_0FAA4999A4AEDA98">
I shall conclude all with a word of Exhortation.</P>
<P>Instead then of Complaining and Discontent, what|ever publick or personal Calamities and Afflictions we are under, Let us say with <HI>Jeremy,</HI> Lam. 3. 22. <HI>It is of the Lords Mercy we are not consumed, because his Compassions fail not:</HI> and with <HI>Job, chap.</HI> 9. 15. <HI>make our Supplication to our Judge.</HI> And in so do|ing, as he, <HI>chap.</HI> 23. 4. fill our mouths with Argu|ments: That is, Let us night and day, together and apart, follow God with humble, penitent, affe|ctionate, fervent and earnest Prayers, and Cries in the Name, and through the Mediation of JESUS CHRIST our Advocate and Meritorious Interces|sor in Heaven, as this afflicted Church, and People of God did in those distressing times, wherein we have their holy Example in the words first penned. And wherewith for our Direction, as suiting our own sorrowful times, I shall conclude.</P>
<Q><BIBL>Psal. 44. 23,24,25,26</BIBL>
<P><HI>Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord, cast us not off for ever?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our Affliction and our Oppression.</HI></P>
<P><HI>For our Soul is bowed down to the Dust, our belly cleaveth unto the Earth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Arise for our help and Redeem us for thy Mercies Sake.</HI> Amen.</P></Q>
