<P N="1">1. OUR Great REDEEMER, has by his good porvidence entertained and encouraged his faithful people, with the redemption of many cap|tives, from the hands of our French and Ind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">an enemies. It is infinitely rea&s;onable, that this good providence of Heaven &s;hould be glorified; and a collection, tho' an imperfect one, of certain me|morables occurring to the&s;e children of the capti|vity, will afford &s;ome great revenues of glory to it; which may be accompanied with &s;everal things, where by the faithful al&s;o may be more than a little edified.</P>
<P N="2">2. Our ea&s;tern Indians, had no &s;ooner, with all po&s;&s;ible a&s;&s;urances, renewed their league of peace with us, but being moved by the in&s;tigation of the French, they perfidiou&s;ly and barbarou&s;ly &s;urpri|zed, &s;even of our more naked and &s;ecure plantati|ons; and coming at once into the &s;cattered families they did, on Augu&s;t 10, 11. 1703. reward the ho&s;pitable civilities that were &s;hown them, with the murder of above &s;eventy Engli&s;h people, and the captivity of near an hundred. Upon this there en&s;ued le&s;&s;er depredations, and captivations, as the treacherous enemy found opportunity for them.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="019426_0003_0FABA3B74D4ECCA0">About half a year after the&s;e calamities thus begun on the ea&s;tern parts of the country, the we&s;tern had a ta&s;te of the &s;ame cup given to them. On February 1703. 4. An army con&s;i&s;ting, as it was judg'd, of about four hundred French and In|dians, made a de&s;cent upon the little town of Deerfield, the mo&s;t northernly &s;ettlement on Con|necticut river, which had long been a watchful and an u&s;eful barrier for the re&s;t of the plantations in the neighbourhood. They &s;urprized the place, about an hour or two before break of day, and in a little time, not without lo&s;s to them&s;elves, they butchered and captivated above one hundred and fifty of the people. Mr. <HI>John Williams,</HI> the worthy mini&s;ter of that pious and holy flock, was carried into captivity, with five of his children; two of his children were &s;lain; and his de&s;irable con&s;ort, beginning to faint, at about a dozen miles of the doleful journey, they the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, like them&s;elves&punc; cruelly murdered her, and left her for the funeral which her friends afterwards be&s;towed on her. Be|fore they reach'd unto Mont-Real, a journey di&s;|patch'd by the parcels now divided, in twenty days, more or le&s;s, near twenty more of the captives lo&s;t their lives; for the manner was, that if any found them&s;elves not able to travel through the deep &s;now, now on the ground, the &s;avages would &s;trike their hatches into their heads, and there leave them weltring in their blood.</P>

<P><PB N="6" REF="019426_0004_0FABA3B8DEDB1028">The French did buy many of the captives, from the Indians, among whom they met with many in&s;tances of humanity, more or le&s;s, accord|ing to the humour of tho&s;e, in who&s;e families they became &s;ervants or &s;ojourners. Others of the cap|tives were a long while detained with the Indians in their horrid and howling wigwams, and &s;ome are to this day mi&s;erably circum&s;tanced among tho&s;e dragons of the wilderne&s;s.

to thrive for &s;oul or body. Yea, neglect of duty, will give great ground to fear that the furnace has not been &s;anctified to your purging and puri|fying.

Yea, all that have gained &s;piritual benefit by afflictions, are much in bewailing their un&s;uitable behaviour under af|flictions. Oh, it's a matter of &s;hame to think how much they pored upon their afflictions, and how lit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le on their &s;ins that procured all their afflictions; that they were &s;o impatient under afflictions; &s;o much concerned to get afflictions removed; and &s;o little concerned to carry graciou&s;ly under them, to profit by them, to get them &s;anctified to them: Yea, that they have been &s;o very unbelieving, and full of carking cares under them, and &s;o back|ward to a committing all to God's di&s;po&s;al; that they have been &s;o full of guile and deceit, and unbroken in &s;pirit in all their acknowledgments and confe&s;&s;ions of &s;in; &s;o little of a gracious prayerfulne&s;s; Yea, that there is &s;o much oppo|&s;ition in their will to the will of God in di&s;po&s;ing and governing the affairs of the world according to the council of his own will; Yea, that they

They bewail that they were &s;o very unthankful for what mercies they had continued to them and that they did no more improve them for God and his glory; whil&s;t others bewail that they have been &s;o long under afflictions; do you bewail that you carried no better under them.

<P>ASTONISHING deliverances have been &s;ent from Heaven, to many of our Captives. They have been many a time upon the point of de&s;truction; but, the&s;e poor ones have cryed unto

<P>'Tis a wonderful re&s;traint from God upon the Bruiti&s;h &s;avages, that no Engli&s;h woman was eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> known to have any violence offered unto her cha&s;ti|ty, by any of them.</P>
<P>'Tis wonderful, that no more of the captives have been murdered by them, neither when they were drunk, nor when the Caprichio's, and the cruelties, of their diabolical natures were to be gra|tified.</P>
<P>'Tis wonderful, that when many of the captives have been ju&s;t going to be &s;acrificed, &s;ome &s;trange interpo&s;ition of the divine Providence has put a &s;top to the execution, and prevented their being made a &s;acrifice. The &s;tories are numberle&s;s. Take a few of them.</P>
<P>ACRUE of Indians had been three days with|out any manner of &s;u&s;tenance. They took an Engli&s;h child, and hung it before the fire to ro&s;t it for their &s;upper; but that the&s;e canibals might &s;atiate their&mdash;I want a name for it,&mdash;as well as their hunger, they would roa&s;t it alive. The child began to &s;well. A canoe arrived at that in&s;tant, with a dog in it. The le&s;&s;er devils of the crue, propo&s;ed their taking the dog in&s;tead of the child; They did &s;o; and the child is yet living! Her name is, <HI>Hannah Par&s;ons.</HI></P>
<P>A Man had valiantly kill'd an indian or two, before the &s;avages took him. He was next morning to undergo an horrible death, whereof the manner and the torture, was to be a&s;&s;igned by the widow Squa of the dead indian. The French prie&s;ts told him, they had laboured to divert the
<PB N="27" REF="019426_0025_0FABA3CC1F9EA678">
tygers from their bloody intention, but could not prevail with them; he mu&s;t prepare for the terri|ble execution. His crys to God were hard, and heard; When the &s;entence of the &s;qua was demand|ed, qui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e contrary to every one's expectation, and the revengful inclination &s;o u&s;ual and well known among the&s;e creatures; &s;he only &s;aid,&mdash;his death won't fetch my hu&s;band to life; Do nothing to him! So nothing was done to him.</P>
<P>A Woman was carried a&s;ide, by her mon&s;ter of a ma&s;ter; he fa&s;tened a rope about her neck; It was in vain for her to contend; the hatchet mu&s;t pre&s;ently have di&s;patched her, if the halter had failed; &s;he had no remedy but to cry unto God; her ma&s;ter throws up the end of the rope over the limb of the tree; he a&s;cends to hale her and to tye her up; and then a fine exploit for the wretch! a <HI>memorable name</HI>! however the limb hap|pily breaks; down he falls! full of madne&s;s, he goes to repeat his brave action: An Indian com|mander ju&s;t in the nick of time comes in upon him; reproaches him very bitterly; takes her away from h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m; and &s;ends her away to Canada.</P>
<P>BUT we ought not to pa&s;s over the marvellous di&s;play of the power of God, in &s;upporting and pre&s;erving the poor captives, when they tra|velled through the horrid wilderne&s;s, oftentimes much more than a &s;core of miles in a day, and thro' very deep &s;nows, and with va&s;t loads on their backs; and grievou&s;ly pinched with hunger, hav|ing &s;carce one bit of any refre&s;hment, for whole days together.

<P>The Indians came upon the hou&s;e of one Adams <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t Wells, and captivated the man and his wife and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated the child<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en; whereof one, who had an hatchet &s;truck into his &s;kull, and was left for dead, was very &s;trangely recovered The woman had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ain in about eight days.

She tra|velled that very day, twenty miles a foot. She was up to the neck in water &s;ix times that very day in pa&s;&s;ing of rivers. At night &s;he fell over head and ears into a &s;lough in a &s;wamp, and was hardly got out a live. She got not the lea&s;t cough nor cold by all of this; &s;he is come home alive unto us.</P>
<P>Many more &s;uch in&s;tances might be mentioned, we will &s;uper&s;ede them all, with a relation of what b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fel Mrs. B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">adley of Haverhill. <HI>Ab una di&s;ce omnes.</HI></P>
<P>THIS virtuous woman, had been formerly for two years together, a captive in the hands of the barba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ous indians; a &s;ubject of wondrous afflictions, of wondrous deliverances.

<P>On Feb. 6, 1703, 4. She with her &s;i&s;ter and a maid or two, and &s;ome children (a man being al&s;o in the room) were talking about the Indians, and

behold one of the fierce tawnies look'd in, with a gun ready to fire upon them. The Engli&s;hman pull'd him in, and got him down, and Mrs. B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">adly took the opportunity to pour a good quantity of &s;calding &s;ope (which was then boiling over the fire) upon him, whereby he was ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l'd immediately. A|nother of the tawnies followed at the heels of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s brother; who &s;tabbed the Engli&s;hman to the heart. Unto him &s;he di&s;pen&s;ed al&s;o a quantity of her &s;ope, which not killing him, &s;he with the other women and children ran into the chamber. The hou&s;e was fired by the indians, and M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s. B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">adly with her companions found it necece&s;&s;ary to retire behind the hou&s;e. One of the women fell into the hands of the indians; and they that remained were Mrs. Bradly and her &s;i&s;ter; each of them having a child of M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s Bradlies with her. The &s;i&s;ter was di&s;cerned by the indians, who commanded her to come out unto them, and threatened that they would el&s;e cut her to pieces. Mrs. Bradly very gener|ou&s;ly bid her &s;it &s;till, and wait for a better time to e&s;cape; and offered her, that ina&s;much as the In|dians knew of but one there, &s;he would be that one, and go out in her &s;tead.

ordinary agility, &s;he travelled with her tawny guar|dians all that night, and the next day until 10 o'+clock; a&s;&s;ociated with one woman more who had been brought to bed but ju&s;t one week before. Here they refre&s;hed them&s;elves a little, and then travelled on till night; when they had no refre&s;h|ment given them, nor had they any till after their having travelled all the forenoon of the day en&s;uing, and then too, whatever &s;he took, &s;he did through &s;ickne&s;s throw it up again.</P>
<P>She underwent incred<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ble hard&s;hip and famine; a Moo&s;es hide, as tough as you may &s;uppo&s;e it, was the be&s;t and the mo&s;t of her diet. In one and twenty days they came to their head quarters, where they &s;taid a fortnight. But then her &s;now &s;hoes were taken from her; and yet &s;he mu&s;t go every &s;tep above the knee in &s;now, with &s;uch wear|ine&s;s, that her faint &s;oul often pray'd, that the Lord would put an end unto her weary life! until they came to another place, where they &s;tay'd for three weeks together.</P>
<P>Here in the night, &s;he found her&s;elf <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll, and having the help of only one woman, who got a little hem|lock to lay about her, and with a few &s;ticks made a &s;hift to blow up a little fire, &s;he was in half an hour delivered of the infant, that &s;he had hitherto gone withal. There &s;he lay, till the next night, with none but the &s;now under her, and the heaven over her; in a mi&s;ty and a rainy &s;ea&s;on. She &s;ent then unto a French Prie&s;t, that he would &s;peak un|to her &s;qua mi&s;tre&s;s, who then, without conde&s;cend|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> upon her, allow'd her a little birch rind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> her head from the injuries of the weather,
<PB N="31" REF="019426_0029_0FABA3CF484C30F8">
and a little bit of dried moo&s;e, which being boiled &s;he drank the broth, and gave it unto the child.</P>
<P>In a fortnight, &s;he was called upon, to travel a|gain with her child in her arms; ever now and then, a whole day together, without the lea&s;t mor|&s;el of any food, and when &s;he had any, &s;he fed only on ground nuts, wild onions and lilly roots. By the la&s;t of May, they arrived at Cowe&s;ick, where they planted their corn; wherein &s;he was put unto a hard ta&s;k, &s;o that the child extremely &s;uffered. The &s;avages would &s;ometimes al&s;o plea&s;e them&s;elves with ca&s;ting hot embers into the mouth of the child, which would render the mouth &s;o &s;ore, that it could not &s;uck for a long while together. So, that &s;tarv'd and died.</P>
<P>Their they &s;taid until they weed their corn; but then &s;ome of our friend indians coming on them, kill'd &s;even of them; whereat, away they fled for Canada, and never &s;aw their corn-field any more. But they made a forty-days ramble of it, before they reach'd thither; in which, if at any time, her heart began to faint, her mi&s;tre&s;s would be ready to &s;trike the mortal hatchet into her head.</P>
<P>The French being thought more civil to the Engli&s;h than to the Indians, her mi&s;tre&s;s thereat provoked, re&s;olved, that &s;he would never &s;ell her to the French. Accordingly &s;he kept her a twelve-month with her, in her &s;qual<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d wigwam: Where, in the following winter, &s;he fell &s;ick of a feaver: but in the very he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ghth and heat of her paroxy&s;ms, her mi&s;tre&s;s would compel her &s;ometimes to &s;pend a winter night, which is there a very bitter one, abroad in all the bitter fro&s;t and &s;now of the cli|mate.
<PB N="32" REF="019426_0030_0FABA3CFDBC8C330">
She recovered; but four Indians died of the fever, and at length her mi&s;tre&s;s al&s;o. Another Squa then pretended an heir&s;hip unto her: with whom &s;he lived and &s;aw many more &s;trange deli|verances. They had the &s;mall pox in the family; but &s;he never had it. She was made to pa&s;s the river on the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce when every &s;tep &s;he took &s;he might have &s;truct through it if &s;he plea&s;ed. Many more &s;uch pre&s;ervations might come into her &s;tory.</P>
<P>At la&s;t, there came to the &s;ight of her, a prie&s;t from Quebec, who had known her in her former captivity at Naridgowock. He was very civil to her, and made the Indians to &s;ell her unto a French family, for four&s;core livres, where, tho' &s;he wrought hard, &s;he lived more comfortably and contentedly.</P>
<P>She poured out her continual &s;upplications to heaven; &s;ometimes two or three of her own &s;ex, would by &s;tealth come to join with her in &s;uppli|cating to the glorious LORD She had her mind often irradiated with &s;trong per&s;ua&s;ions and a&s;&s;uran|ces, that &s;he &s;hould yet &s;ee the goodne&s;s of God in this land of the living.

Then I begged liberty to pray unto God, before he killed me; and he granted it me. As I was at prayer, it &s;truck into my mind, That I had formerly heard your&s;elf declare in your pul|pit, what great and wonderful things had been done by prayer; particularly, that it had &s;topped the mouths of lions, and that it had quenched the violence of the fire.
