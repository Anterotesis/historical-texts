<LG>
<L>SPRUNG from a race that long had till'd the &s;oil</L>
<L>And fir&s;t dis-rob'd it of its native trees,</L>
<L>He cho&s;e to heir their lands, but not their toil,</L>
<L>And thought the ploughman's life no life of ea&s;e&mdash;</L>
<L>"'Tis wrong (thought he) the&s;e pretty hands to wound</L>
<L>"With felling oaks, or delving in the ground:</L>
<L>"I who, at lea&s;t have forty pounds in ca&s;h</L>
<L>"And in a country &s;tore might cut a da&s;h,</L>
<L>"Why &s;hould I till the&s;e barren fields (he &s;aid)</L>
<L>("I who have learnt to cypher, write, and read)</L>
<L>"The&s;e fields that &s;hrubs, and weeds, and brambles bear,</L>
<L>"That pay me not, and only bring me care?"</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some thoughts had he, long while, to quit the &s;od</L>
<L>In &s;ea-port towns to try his luck in trade,</L>
<L>But then their ways of living &s;eem'd mo&s;t odd &mdash;</L>
<L>For du&s;ty &s;treets to leave his native &s;hade,</L>
<L>From gra&s;&s;y plats to pebbled walks remov'd&mdash;</L>
<L>The more he thought of them the le&s;s he lov'd:</L>
<L>The city-&s;prings he could not drink; and &s;till</L>
<L>Preferr'd the fountain, underneath the hill.&mdash;</L>

<L>Hard by the road a pigmy building &s;tood,</L>

<L><HI>In truth, may not our garret do as well?</HI>&mdash;</L>
<L>So down he took his hams and bacon flitches,</L>
<L>Re&s;olv'd to fill the place with other riches:</L>
<L>From every hole and cranny bru&s;h'd the &s;oot,</L>
<L>And fix'd up &s;helves throughout the crazy hut:</L>
<L>A counter, too, mo&s;t cunningly was plann'd</L>

<LG>
<L><HI>Mola&s;&s;es</HI> too (ble&s;t &s;weet) was not forgot,</L>

<L>But why &s;hould I his invoice here repeat?</L>
<L>'T would be like counting grains in pecks of wheat;</L>
<L>Half Europe's li&s;t was on his invoice found,</L>

<L>Soon as the early dawn proclaim'd the day</L>
<L>He cock'd his hat with pins, and comb'd his hair,</L>
<L>Curious it was, and laughable, to &s;ee</L>
<L>The <HI>village-merchant</HI> mounted in his chair:</L>
<L>Shelves pil'd with lawns and linens, in his head,</L>
<L>Coatings, and &s;tuffs, and cloths, and &s;carlets <HI>red</HI>&mdash;</L>
<L>All that would &s;uit man, woman, girl, or boy,</L>

<L>Alack! &s;aid I&mdash;he little, little dreams</L>

<L>His ca&s;h!&mdash;the mother of a thou&s;and &s;chemes,</L>
<L>Will hardly buy&mdash;a load of earthen ware!</L>
<L>But why &s;hould I excite the hidden tear</L>
<L>By whi&s;pering truths, ungrateful to his ear?</L>
<L>Still let him travel on, with heart elate,</L>
<L>As <HI>Di&s;appointment never comes too late.</HI></L>

<L>Though woods ob&s;cure and dull perplexing ways</L>

<LG>
<L>Now &s;afe arrived upon the pebbled way</L>
<L>Where well-born &s;teeds the rattling coaches trail,</L>

<L>Amaz'd alike, the merchant and his pair</L>
<L>Of &s;care-crow &s;teeds, did nothing el&s;e but &s;tare;</L>
<L>So new was all the &s;cene, that, &s;mit with awe,</L>

<L>Lur'd by the bait the wiley trader laid,</L>

<HEAD>THE COUNTRY PRINTER: A POEM.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>De&s;cription of his Village.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>BESIDE a &s;tream that never yet ran dry,</L>
<L>There &s;tands, a TOWN, not high advanced in fame;</L>
<L>Tho' few its buildings, rais'd to plea&s;e the eye,</L>
<L>Still this proud title it may fairly claim;</L>
<L>A <HI>Tavern</HI> (its fir&s;t requi&s;ite) is there,</L>
<L>A <HI>mill</HI> a <HI>black-&s;mith's &s;hop,</HI> a <HI>hou&s;e of prayer.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nay, more&mdash;a little market-hou&s;e is &s;een</L>
<L>And iron hooks where beef was never hung,</L>
<L>Nor pork, nor bacon, poultry fat or lean,</L>
<L>Pigs head, or &s;au&s;age link, or bullock's tongue:</L>
<L>Look when you will, you &s;ee the vacant bench</L>
<L>No butcher &s;eated there, no country wench.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Great aims were his, who fir&s;t contriv'd this town;</L>
<L>A market he would have,&mdash;but, humbled now,</L>
<L>Sighing we &s;ee its fabrick mouldring down,</L>
<L>That only &s;erves at night to pen the cow:</L>
<L>And hence, by way of je&s;ting, may be &s;aid,</L>
<L>That beef is there, tho' never beef that's dead.</L>

<PB N="13" REF="027019_0012_0FD33048EBCB8470">
<L>A brea&s;t the inn&mdash;a tree before the door,</L>
<L>A Printing-Office lifts its humble head,</L>
<L>Where ma&s;ter <HI>Type</HI> old journals doth explore</L>
<L>For news that is thro' all the village read;</L>
<L>Who, year from year, (&s;o cruel is his lot)</L>
<L>Is author, pre&s;&s;man, devil&mdash;and what not?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Fame &s;ays he is an odd and curious wight,</L>
<L>Fond to di&s;traction of his native place</L>
<L>In &s;en&s;e not very dull nor very bright,</L>
<L>Yet &s;hows &s;ome marks of humour in his face,</L>
<L>One who can pen an anecdote complete,</L>
<L>Or plague the par&s;on with the mackled &s;heet.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Three times a week by nimble geldings drawn</L>
<L>A &s;tage arrives but &s;carcely deigns to &s;top,</L>
<L>Unle&s;s the driver far in liquor gone</L>
<L>Has made &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s for the black-&s;mith-&s;hop,</L>
<L>Then comes this printer's harve&s;t-time of news,</L>
<L>Welcome alike from Chri&s;tians, Turks, or Jews.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All is not <HI>Truth</HI> ('tis &s;aid) that travellers tell&mdash;</L>
<L>So much the better for this man of news:</L>
<L>For hence, the country round that know him well,</L>
<L>Will, if he prints &s;ome lies, his lies excu&s;e.</L>
<L>Earthquakes, and battles, &s;hipwrecks, myriads &s;lain&mdash;</L>
<L>If fal&s;e or true&mdash;alike to him are gain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But if this motley tribe &s;ay nothing new,</L>
<L>Then many a lazy, longing look is ca&s;t</L>
<L>To watch the weary po&s;t-boy travelling through,</L>
<L>On hor&s;e's rump, his budget buckled fa&s;t;</L>
<L>With letters &s;afe in leathern pri&s;on pent</L>
<L>And wet from pre&s;s, full many a packet &s;ent.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Not Argus with his fifty pair of eyes,</L>
<L>Look'd &s;harper for his prey than hone&s;t TYPE</L>
<L>Explores each package, of aluring &s;ize,</L>
<L>Prepar'd to &s;eize them with a nimble gripe,</L>
<L>Did not the po&s;t-boy watch his goods and &s;wear</L>
<L>That village TYPE &s;hould only have his &s;hare.</L>

<L>A&s;k you what <HI>matter</HI> fills his various page?</L>

<L>What'er is done, on madam TERRA's &s;tage</L>
<L>He to the knowledg of his town&s;men brings:</L>
<L>One while, he tells of monarchs run away;</L>
<L>And now, of witches drown'd in Buzzard's bay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some miracles he makes, and &s;ome he &s;teals;</L>
<L>Half nature's works are giants in his eyes:</L>
<L>Much, very much, in wonderment he deals,&mdash;</L>
<L>New-Hamp&s;hire apples grown to pompkins &s;ize</L>
<L>Pompkins almo&s;t as large as country inns</L>

<L>A paragraph from him is all they claim;</L>

<L>Source of the wi&s;dom of the country round,</L>
<L>Again I turn to that poor lonely <HI>&s;hed</HI>&punc;</L>
<L>Where many an author all his fame has found,</L>
<L>And wretched proofs by candle-light are read,</L>
<L>Inverted letters; left the page to grace,</L>
<L>Colons derang'd, and commas out of place.</L>

<L>Beneath this roof the Mu&s;es cho&s;e their home;&mdash;</L>
<L>Sad was their choice, le&s;s booki&s;h ladies &s;ay,</L>

<L>One &s;ingle cob-web was not bru&s;h'd away:&mdash;</L>
<L>Fate early had pronounc'd this building's doom</L>
<L>Ne'er to be plagu'd with boonder, bru&s;h, or broom.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here, full in view, the ink-be&s;pangled pre&s;s</L>
<L>Gives to the world its children, with a groan,</L>
<L>Some born to live a month&mdash;a day&mdash;&s;ome le&s;s.</L>

<L>With Pre&s;s and Pen attack'd the royal &s;ide,</L>
<L>Did what he could to pull their Lyon down,</L>
<L>Clipp'd at his tail, and twitch'd his <HI>&s;acred</HI> hide.</L>
<L>Mimick'd his roarings; trod upon his toes,</L>
<L>Pelted young whelps, and tweak'd the old one's no&s;e.</L>

<L>Rous'd by his page, at church or Court-Hou&s;e read,</L>
<L>From depths of woods the willing ru&s;tics ran,</L>
<L>Now by a prie&s;t, and now &s;ome deacon led</L>
<L>With clubs and &s;pits to guard the rights of man;</L>
