<HEAD>To the <HI>READER.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Conduct of Divine Providence in bring|ing to pa&s;s the Publication of the follow|ing Sermon, was thus; One that heard it Preach'd, asked the <HI>Reverend Author</HI> for a Copy, who expre&s;&s;ed his willingne&s;s to grant it. He that heard it Preached was &s;oon after in the Com|pany of &s;everal <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> &amp; <HI>Deacons,</HI> unto whom upon Repre&s;entation made of &s;aid Sermon, and propo&s;al for a Collection for the Printing of it, It was com|plyed with; whereupon Addre&s;s was made to the Worthy Author for a Copy and obtained it of him. The Lord in mercy Reward the Author according to his pains &amp; good will for Publick Good thereby; &amp; the Per&s;ons at who&s;e expence the Impre&s;&s;ion was made, having expended of their Sub&s;tance in &s;o good <MILESTONE N="4"> a way of leading men to the honour of God. The known Eminence of the Author and the Reading the En&s;uing Sermon will Commend it to you. The Singularity of it is that it brings Error under view, that you may be alarumed &amp; &s;hun it, &amp; Truth that you may Embrace it and keep it. It aims at the Advancing Good Preaching, which being done it tends to advance Good Hearing, which being ad|vanced, Hearers do advance unto, &amp; in Faith &amp; Piety. The Scope is Sublime, the Matter is Pertinent: Preachers are Directed as to the matter manner and End of Preaching, &amp; Hearers are Directed to try the matter of Preaching and to Determine what is Sound. It leads to the preparing of Preachers and Hearers to rejoice together in the Day of Accounts
<PB N="ii" REF="002585_0003_0FDB14F96F96FFA8">
Another Remark that I will make to you of the En|&s;uing Di&s;cour&s;e, is, that it Imitates the Method that CHRIST our great Shepherd took for the Reforming the Seven Churches of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> which was that <HI>John</HI> &s;hould write to the Angels or Pa&s;tors of the Churches, That they might fir&s;t &s;ee their own Defaults &amp; be awakened to amend them&s;elves, and thereupon be prepared &amp; animated to Reprove, to Reform their People. Mini&s;ters being Orthodox and Fervent in Preaching, Prudent in their Conduct, &amp; Exemplary in their Conver&s;ation, are Excellent Ble&s;&s;ings to a Place. Have you plenty of Good Preaching? You are highly favoured of God, you have the means of making the be&s;t Gains; Ble&s;s GOD for it, and E|&s;teem your Preacher highly in Love for his Works &s;ake, If you are under Dull Preaching, take heed of a froward Mouth and wrangling Carriage. Con|&s;ider your Preacher is &s;uch as God's Providence hath carved to you; and remember that GOD is able to give to you help in that matter. Lament it before GOD, &amp; Pray Night &amp; Day for your Preacher, that the LORD will enlarge him with Grace and Mi|ni&s;terial Gifts; and do what you can to Advantage him in his great Work.</P>

In order to his incouragement (in ca&s;e of di&s;orders by Stubborn Per&s;ons) &s;ay to him, as <HI>Shechaniah</HI> did to <HI>Ezra,</HI> Ezra 10.4 <HI>Ari&s;e, for this matter belongeth unto thee, we al&s;o will be with thee: be of good Courage</HI>&mdash; And look into his Outward &s;tate, if it be low, di&s;ad|vantagious, &s;ow more Liberally of your Earthly things, in order to his help &amp; in order unto &amp; in hope of Reaping more plentifully of his Spiritual good things. Moreover, Intreat him as a Father, to &s;trive &amp; Pray for Enlargement in his work. Don't enter|tain &s;uch low tho'ts of him as to neglect to improve

him as your Spiritual Coun&s;ellor &amp; Guide, to help in difficult and dark&s;om Ca&s;es, and to Spiritual Fruitfulne&s;s and to the plea&s;ure of Piety. Try what Improvements will do, to your own and his advantage, As the Improvement of a Bodily Phy&s;i|cian is the way of increa&s;ing his Skill, &s;o is the Im|provement of a Spiritual Phy&s;ician. Look that in your Conver&s;e or Vi&s;its, you be not too prolix or tedious, &s;o as to occa&s;ion his or your mi&s;pence of &amp; lo&s;s of Time.</P>
<P>If by the Reading a Pa&s;&s;age in the En&s;uing Ser|mon to this purpo&s;e, <HI>That it is frequent with Per&s;ons that have attained to Conver&s;ion, to know the Time of their Conver&s;ion</HI>; Your Soul &s;hould be ca&s;t into a dark&s;om dejected Ca&s;e, becau&s;e altho' you have thought you had been Converted, now you fear you was deceived, becau&s;e you don't know the Time of your Conver&s;ion. Then</P>
<P N="1">1. Don't hang in doubt about the Life of Grace that you are called unto. Don't quiet your &s;elf with a thinking that it is Likely that you are Converted. But;</P>
<P N="2">2. Commune with your &s;elf. Search your Heart, Try your &s;tate; that you may find whether there hath not been the acting of Faith, of Repentance, Love to God &amp; Chri&s;t, &amp; love to Fellow-Chri&s;ti|ans. Con&s;ider whether you have not experienc'd that God hath &s;hed abroad His Love in your Heart by His Holy Spirit. And if after your Care to find a rea&s;on for a Good Hope, you are doubtful whether your Rea&s;on thereof be good, get the Judgment of an Experienced Mini&s;ter, whether the rea&s;on of your Hope is good. If you can find no &s;ign of Grace, but do find rea&s;on to believe, and do verily believe, that a Saving Change hath never been wrought in you. Then</P>
<P N="1">1. Lament, bewail your Ca&s;e before GOD, &s;ay|ing, Oh! Wretched Per&s;on I am, who &s;hall deliver

me from the Body of this Death? I am Mi&s;era|ble, Poor, Blind and Naked.</P>
<P N="2">2. Ob&s;erve that your help is to be found in GOD. He tells you, Thou ha&s;t de&s;troyed thy &s;elf, but in Me is thy help found.</P>
<P N="3">3. Pray earne&s;tly that the Holy Gho&s;t may come unto you &amp; Convince you of Sin, Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Judgment; that he will make the Law your School-ma&s;ter: That &s;heweth to you your Condemned Ac|cur&s;ed &s;tate. The want of a thorough Work of the Law is the unhappine&s;s of a great part of Profe&s;&s;ors. You mu&s;t earne&s;tly Employ your &s;elf in Reading or Hearing &amp; Meditating of the Doctrine of God's Righteous Law, &amp; in making particular Application of the Sentence &amp; Cur&s;e of it to your &s;elf. Read and Meditate of the Doctrine of the work of the Holy Spirit preparatory to Faith Seek for the Enlight|ning and Powerful Operation of GOD to attend the means of Convincing you of your Sinfulne&s;s, Vilene&s;s and Nothingne&s;s, as to Meriting Favour from GOD.</P>
<P N="4">4. Watch, Pray and Wait, Night and Day, that GOD will make His Mercy known to you, in pour|ing into you His Spirit of Grace and Supplication. Patiently wait upon Him in His appointed ways, to know a Time of a Lively Faith on CHRIST, a Time of Repentance or of Love to GOD, and to Fellow-Chri&s;tians, &s;o as to know a Time of your Conver&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Whereas the U&s;e of Notes in Preaching, is di&s;ap|proved by &s;uch a worthy Father in our I&s;rael</HI>; I wi&s;h it may extend to Correct or Prevent the u&s;e of Notes &s;o as to <HI>carry along the Finger with the Line,</HI> as hath been Practi&s;ed by &s;ome, <HI>a de&s;picable way,</HI> like Learn|ers in Spelling. And it will be well Improved by others that <HI>do u&s;e Notes</HI> in a le&s;s Degree, by their being led to an Examination of their Practi&s;e, and to a faulting them&s;elves, if it be through a want of Care

and Pains; but <HI>if the U&s;e of Notes</HI> be from a being Con&s;cious of a <HI>weakne&s;s of Memory,</HI> by their being led to an humble U&s;e of them, &amp; an Ob&s;ervation of the nece&s;&s;ity thereof, that their Hearers may not lo&s;e much of the benefit of their <HI>Studying</HI> for them. If Notes mu&s;t be u&s;ed, let there be a due Care not to depend &s;o on them as to hinder Ge&s;ture in Preaching and an holy In&s;pection of the Congregation: Let there be Endeavours to attain in a good Degree, to the &s;cope of our Reverend Leader and Father, <HI>viz.</HI> the Emendation or Bettering of our Preaching. Our Indebtedne&s;s to him for the en&s;uing Di&s;cour&s;e and other Fruits of his Labours, Extant for Publick Benefit, is to be acknowledged: May we Thank|fully Receive and well Improve them, and he Re|ceive an&s;werable Reward.</P>
<P><HI>My De&s;ire &amp; Prayer is, that the Ble&s;&s;ing of</HI> CHRIST <HI>may attend the following Labour of his Servant, to advancement of the Spiritual Pro&s;perity of his People and the Honour of his Name,</HI> viz. <HI>of CHRIST our Glorious Redeemer; and that he will be with his</HI> Mi|ni&s;ters <HI>of his Go&s;pel always even to the End.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Defects of Preachers Reproved.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>MATTHEW XXIII.2, 3.</HI></BIBL>
<P>The Scribes and the Phari&s;ees &s;it in <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;eat.</P>
<P>All therefore what&s;oever they bid you ob&s;erve, that ob&s;erve and do.&mdash;</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the&s;e Words is a Direction given by Chri&s;t unto the People: Where we have</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, The Foundation of the Rule, The Scribes &amp; Phari&s;ees &s;it on <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> Seat. Some take this as &s;poken of the Sanhe|drim, who were the Succe&s;&s;ors of Mo&s;es and the Seventy Elders of I&s;rael. Po&s;&s;ibly that may be a mi&s;take, for &s;everal of the Sanhe|drim were not Phari&s;ees. <HI>Act.</HI> 23.3. For the chief Prie&s;ts did belong to that Society, <HI>Act.</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="002585_0008_0FDB15572F5E9E10">
4.6. And they are &s;aid to be Sadducees; but by Scribes &amp; Phari&s;ees I under&s;tand the Prin|cipal Teachers among the <HI>Jews.</HI> The Prie&s;ts and Levites were more e&s;pecially Devoted to the &s;tudy of the Law; Deut. 33.10 <HI>They &s;hall teach Jacob thy Judgments, and I&s;rael thy Law</HI>&mdash;. Yet others that were Learned in the Law, were made u&s;e of to In&s;truct the People, &amp; were cho&s;en to be Rulers of the Synagogues. The Phari&s;ees were of any Tribe, <HI>Paul</HI> who Was of the Tribe of <HI>Benjamin</HI> was a Phari&s;ee by Education, as he tells Act. 23.6. &mdash; <HI>I am a Phari&s;ee, the &s;on of a Phari&s;ee.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, Here is the Rule given, What they bid you ob&s;erve, that ob&s;erve and do. This mu&s;t needs be under&s;tood with that Limitation, when they Teach according to the Mind of God. Sometimes they taught for Doctrines the Commandments of Men, &amp; then it was Sinful &amp; Dangerous to ob&s;erve their Directions. If the Blind lead the Blind, both &s;hall fall into the ditch, <HI>Mat.</HI> 15.14. The Doctrine is,</P>
<P><HI>DOCT.</HI> There may be a great deal of good Preaching in a Country, and yet a great want of good Preaching.</P>
<P>It is a felicity to a People when there is good Preaching in the Land, yet there may in
<PB N="3" REF="002585_0009_0FDB155BBAEFE7E8">
the &s;ame Land, be great want of good Teach|ing. Some things that are very u&s;eful may be plainly and fully taught, and other things that might be as u&s;eful may be Neglected; many &s;ound Principles in Religion may be Taught, and other things that are of great Concernment unto Souls may be omitted. Mini&s;ters don't &s;ufficiently do their Duty, if they Preach many &s;ound Truths, and do it convincingly and with good affection, if they do it with great clearne&s;s and evidence, pro|vided they neglect other things that are needful to Salvation. And &s;o it falls out &s;ome|times that men that make many good Ser|mons, are very defective in Preaching &s;ome other things that they ought to Preach.</P>
<P>I &s;hall clear this in Three In&s;tances.</P>
<P N="1">1. Of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees in I&s;rael. They taught the People that there was only One God the Maker of all things; and were great Enemies to the Idolatry that their Fa|thers were guilty of, before the Babyloni&s;h Captivity; as the Scribe owned to Chri&s;t, Mark. 12.32. <HI>Well, Ma&s;ter, thou ha&s;t &s;aid the truth: for there is one God, and there is none other but he.</HI> They taught many Moral Du|ties, that men mu&s;t love God &amp; believe his Word; that they mu&s;t be Ju&s;t &amp; Cha&s;t and
<PB N="4" REF="002585_0010_0FDB155CC7517960">
men of Truth, and were very &s;trict in the Ob&s;ervation of the Sabbath: They limitted men how far they might go on the Sabbath. <HI>Acts</HI> 1.12. We read of a Sabbath days Jour|ney. They taught truly the Doctrine of the Re&s;urrection of the Dead: Act. 23.7, 8. The Phari&s;ees di&s;&s;ented from the Sadducees, <HI>the Sadducees &s;ay there is no Re&s;urrection, nor Angel nor Spirit, but the Phari&s;ees confe&s;s both.</HI> They taught that the Me&s;&s;iah was to come; the Sa|maritans them&s;elves received that Doctrine, <HI>Joh.</HI> 4.25 They were very punctual in teaching Circumci&s;ion &amp; the Ceremonies of the Law of Mo&s;es, about Sacrifices, Tythes, and Legal Uncleanne&s;s.</P>
<P>But they were very faulty in Preaching in other particulars: They were ignorant of the Doctrine of Regeneration, So Nicodemus, Joh. 3.4. he &s;ays, <HI>How can a man be born when he is old?</HI> They taught that the fir&s;t motions of Lu&s;t, if the Will did not con&s;ent, were not Sins. As we may gather from Rom. 7.7. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays, I had not known Lu&s;t, except the Law had &s;aid thou &s;halt not Covet. And from Mat. 5.27, 28. <HI>It was &s;aid by them of old time, thou &s;halt not commit Adultery. But I &s;ay who&s;oever looketh on a woman to lu&s;t after her, hath committed Adultery in his heart.</HI> They taught al&s;o that dangerous Doctrine of Justification by Works, Rom. 10.3. <HI>They went about to e|&s;tabli&s;h
<PB N="5" REF="002585_0011_0FDB155DF844F3F8">
their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Rom. 9.2.3 <HI>They &s;ought it as it were by the works of the Law:</HI> They taught the People that in ca&s;e they devoted their E&s;tates to the Temple, they need not relieve their Fathers or Mothers, <HI>Mat.</HI> 15.4, 5; 6. And above all they taught that JESUS of Nazareth was not the Me&s;&s;iah, brought many Objections again&s;t Him; As that He came out of Galilee, was a Glutton|ous man and a Wine bibber, <HI>Mat.</HI> 11.19. A friend of Publicans and Sinners: They Re|proached Him that by the Devil he ca&s;t out Devils: and they were very dull in their Preaching, <HI>Mat.</HI> 7.29.</P>
<P N="2">2. Of the Papi&s;ts. They teach the Do|ctrine of the Trinity truly, and the Attributes of God: So the Doctrine of the Incarnation of CHRIST, and that He died for our Re|demption and is at the Right hand of God: They teach the Doctrine of the day of Judg|ment, of Heaven and of Hell, and many Moral Rules.</P>
<P>But they Preach a multitude of fal&s;e Do|ctrines with the&s;e Doctrines, that are perni|cious to the Souls of men: They teach men to &s;eek the pardon of their Sin by afflicting their Bodies, by Pilgrimage &amp; paying a &s;um of Money: They teach many horrible things with re&s;pect to their Pope, that he has power
<PB N="6" REF="002585_0012_0FDB1563B0E61100">
to forgive Sin, to di&s;pen&s;e with ince&s;tu|ous Marriages; that he has power over all the Churches and may di&s;pen&s;e with the Laws of GOD; that he is infallible: They teach the Doctrine of Image-wor&s;hip, aboli&s;h|ing the Second Commandment&punc; They teach Prayer to Saints departed, the Unlawfulne&s;s of Prie&s;ts Marriages, the Doctrine of Purga|tory, Ju&s;tification by Works, a conditional Election, the power of Free-will, falling from Grace, and Hundreds of other Erroneous Doctrines: They do indeed &s;ubvert the Faith of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="3">3. Of the Arminians. Many of them Preach very profitably, about GOD and the Per&s;on of CHRIST, about Ju&s;tification by Faith and Univer&s;al Obedience, about the Day of Judgment &amp; of Eternal Rewards and Puni&s;hments.</P>
<P>But there is a great deal of want of good Preaching among them: They decry all ab|&s;olute Decrees of Election and Reprobation, making the Decrees of God to depend on the fore&s;ight of Repentance or Impenitence; they a&s;&s;ert Univer&s;al Redemption, as if Chri&s;t died to make all men Salvable: They deny the Propagation of Sin, &s;aying men become &s;inners by Imitation: They hold a Power in Man to with&s;tand the Grace of GOD; that after GOD has done His work, it is in the
<PB N="7" REF="002585_0013_0FDB1564A5CB9150">
power of Man to refu&s;e to be Converted: They don't acknowlege the &s;ervitude of man to Sin, but hath power with that a&s;&s;i&s;tance that God affords, to Convert him&s;elf: They deny the Doctrine of Per&s;everance. The&s;e things draw a great train of Errors after them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Rea&s;on of the Doctrine</HI> is, Becau&s;e &s;ome Preachers are men of Learning &amp; Moral <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, and they have drunk in &s;ome Errors, &amp; they want Experience. Learning and Morality will qualify men to make many good and profitable Sermons, much for the Edification of the Hearers. Learning qualifies men to clear up many Principles of Religion; and a Moral di&s;po&s;ition may fit men zealou&s;ly to Reprove vicious Practices: But men may be Learned men, yet drink in very Corrupt Doctrines. Learning is no &s;ecurity again&s;t Erronious Principles: The Phari&s;ees and Sadducees were men of Liberal Education, yet leavened with many fal&s;e Principles: Mat. 16.6 <HI>Beware of the leaven of the Phari&s;ees &amp; Sadducees.</HI> &amp; ver. 12. <HI>Then under&s;tood they that he bid them not beware of the leaven of bread; but of the doctrine of the Phari&s;ees &amp; of the Sad|ducees.</HI> Learning will not cure tho&s;e di&s;tem|pers of the Heart that do expo&s;e men to fal&s;e Opinions; Learning will not cure the Pride &amp; Conceitedne&s;s of mens Hearts. Men
<PB N="8" REF="002585_0014_0FDB1565A3205AF8">
of Learning may lean too much to their own Under&s;tanding. Men of Learning may be led a&s;ide by Reading Erronious Books. Learned Education will not deliver men from Carnal Rea&s;on: Men of corrupt Af|fections are very inclinable to imbibe bad Principles: Men of Learning may be blind men. Chri&s;t &s;ays of the Phari&s;ees, <HI>They be blind, leaders of the blind,</HI> Mat. 15.14. Mo&s;t of the Errors in the world in matters of Religi|on, have been hatched by men of Learning. <HI>Arius, Socinus,</HI> and <HI>Arminius,</HI> and <HI>Pelagius</HI> were Learned men: Errors in Religion have been generally the Off-&s;pring of great Scho|lars, have been propagated by them. And men may be Moral men that have no expe|rience of the work of God upon their hearts. Men may be Zealous men again&s;t Drunken|ne&s;s and Whoredom, that have no Saving Knowledge of Chri&s;t. Many Moral men have no Communion with God; no Experi|ence of a Saving Change in their own Souls. Men may be very Moral &amp; have no experi|ence of a work of Humiliation, or being bro't off from their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, or a work of Faith; of the difference that is between the Common and Special work of the Spirit; of the difference between Saving &amp; Common Illumination, of the working of the heart under Temptation, of the way wherein godly
<PB N="9" REF="002585_0015_0FDB156B1ED16F50">
men are wont to find Relief. Every Learned &amp; Moral man is not a Sincere Convert, &amp; &s;o not able to &s;peak exactly and experimentally to &s;uch things as Souls want to be in&s;truct|ed in. It is as with a man that has &s;een a Map of a Country, or has read a great deal about it; he can't tell the way between Town and Town, and hundreds of particular Circum&s;tances, as a man that has Travelled or Lived there is able to do. Experience fits men to Teach others. A man that has him&s;elf had only a common work of the Spirit and judges it &s;aving, is very unfit to judge of the State of other men. Men Would not put their Lives into the hands of an unskilful Phy&s;ician, or tru&s;t their Ship with an unskilful Pilot, or an intricate Ca&s;e depend|ing in the Law with an unskilful Lawyer.</P>
<P>USE, I. <HI>Of Examination,</HI> Whether it be not thus in this Country? It is notoriou&s;ly known by tho&s;e that are acquainted with the &s;tate of the Chri&s;tian World, that tho' there be many eminent Truths taught, yet there is a great want of good Preaching; whence it comes to pa&s;s, that among Pro|fe&s;&s;ors a &s;pirit of Piety runs exceeding low. But it is proper for us to take notice how it is among our &s;elves; and tho' it be very evi|dent that there is a great deal of good Preach|ing
<PB N="10" REF="002585_0016_0FDB156C263C6FD8">
in the Land, and the way of Salvation is Preached with a great deal of plainne&s;s &amp; power, and many men are very faithful to declare all the Coun&s;el of God; yet there may be cau&s;e of Lamentation, that there is a great deal wanting in &s;ome places: Some may be very much to blame in not Preach|ing as they ought to do.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>If any be taught that frequently men are ignorant of the Time of their Conver&s;ion, that is not good Preaching.</HI> Some are of that Opinion, and its like they may drink it in from their Mini&s;ters. This is a delu&s;ion, and it may do them a great deal of hurt; it hardens men in their Natural Condition. <HI>Paul</HI> knew the time of his Conver&s;ion; <HI>At Midday, O King, I &s;aw a Light from Heaven, above the brightne&s;s of the Sun,</HI> Act. 26.13. Men are frequently at a lo&s;s whether their Conver&s;ion were true or not; but &s;urely men that are Converted mu&s;t take &s;ome notice of the Time when God made a Change in them: Conver&s;ion is a great change, from darkne&s;s to light, from death to life, from the borders of de&s;pair to a &s;pirit of faith in Chri&s;t. As for the out|ward Conver&s;ation, there is &s;ometimes little difference; men might carry very well be|fore: But as to the frame of mens Hearts, there is a very great difference. Formerly

Men are generally a long time &s;eeking Conver|&s;ion, labouring to get an intere&s;t in Chri&s;t; and it would be much if when God reveals Chri&s;t to them, they &s;hould not take notice of it when the change is made; Ten to one but Con&s;cience will take notice of it. When a Seaman comes into the Harbour, when a Pri&s;oner is pardoned, when a Victory is ob|tained, when a Di&s;ea&s;e is broke, it would be much if men &s;hould take no notice of them. Conver&s;ion is the greate&s;t change that men undergo in this world, &s;urely it falls under Ob&s;ervation.

While People have a Foundation to build upon, they will not build upon Chri&s;t. A Self-righteous &s;pirit is quite contrary to the Go&s;pel: If men be Self-righteous men, they will not judge it fair for God to ca&s;t them off. Men that de|pend upon the Ju&s;tice of God, will not de|pend upon the meer Mercy of God. Men that lay claim to Heaven from their own Works, will not depend on that Plea that Chri&s;t has given his life a Ran&s;om for many, and has Redeemed us from the Cur&s;e being made a Cur&s;e for us. Multitudes of men are ruined by building upon a Sandy Foun|dation. Men mu&s;t &s;ee their Malady, before they &s;ee their Remedy.

Mini&s;ters are faulty when they &s;peak to them with gentlene&s;s, as <HI>Eli</HI> rebuked his Sons. Chri&s;t Je&s;us often warned them of the danger of Damnation: Mat. 5 <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">9, 30. <HI>It is better that one of thy members &s;hould peri&s;h, &amp; not that thy whole body &s;hould be ca&s;t into hell.</HI> Mat 7.13. <HI>Broad is the gate &amp; wide is the way that leadeth to de&s;truction, and many there be that go in thereat.</HI> Mat. 13.42 <HI>The Angels &s;hall ca&s;t them into a furnace of fire, there &s;hall be wailing and gna&s;hing of teeth.</HI> So al&s;o, <HI>Mat.</HI> 22.13. <HI>Mat.</HI> 25.41, 46.

<P N="4">4. <HI>If they give a wrong account of the nature of Ju&s;tifying Faith, that is not good preaching.</HI> Ju&s;tifying Faith is &s;et forth in the Scripture by many figurative Expre&s;&s;ions; Coming to Chri&s;t, Opening to Him, &s;itting under his Shadow, flying to Him for Refuge, building on Him as on a Foundation, feeding on Him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions do imply not only an act of the Under&s;tanding, but al&s;o an act of the Will, accepting of Him, depend|ing on Him. This Doctrine is de&s;pi&s;ed by &s;ome, and Faith in Chri&s;t is &s;aid to be only a Per&s;wa&s;ion of the truth of the Chri&s;tian Religion. This is the way to make multi|tudes of Carnal men &s;ecure, and to flatter them&s;elves as if they were in a good Con|dition: They &s;ay they are no Heathens, nor Turks, nor Papi&s;ts, nor Jews, but they be|lieve that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the Eternal Son of God, they hope they are Believers; but multitudes of People have &s;uch a Faith that will fall &s;hort of Eternal Life: Joh. 2.23, 24 <HI>Many believed in his name, when they &s;aw the miracles that he did; but Je&s;us did not commit him&s;elf unto them.</HI> Joh. 12.42, 43. <HI>Among the chief rulers many believed on him, but becau&s;e of

the Phari&s;ees they did not confe&s;s him.</HI> The Faith of &s;ome men is only a Per&s;wa&s;ion from their Education: As Heathens do re|ceive the Religion of their Fore-fathers by Tradition, &s;o the&s;e do receive the Chri&s;tian Religion from Hear-&s;ay. But Ju&s;tifying Faith is wrought in men by the mighty Power of God; 2 The&s;&s;. 1.11. <HI>That he would work in you, the work of faith with power.</HI> Eph. 1.19, 20. <HI>And what is the exceeding greatne&s;s of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power; which he wrought in Chri&s;t when he rai&s;ed him from the dead?</HI> By Ju&s;tifying Faith, men an&s;wer the Calls of God, relinqui&s;hing their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, place their Dependance only on the Mediation of Chri&s;t; Heb. 6.18 <HI>They flee for refuge, to lay hold on the hope that is &s;et be|fore them.</HI> Ju&s;tifying Faith is a living Prin|ciple that Sanctifies men; Act. 15.9. <HI>Pu|rifying their hearts by faith.</HI> Many men have a common Per&s;wa&s;ion of the truth of the Go&s;pel, that are utterly de&s;titute of Holi|ne&s;s: But true Ju&s;tifying Faith is always accompanied with an Holy Life.

two &s;orts: Some are Probable, and they mu&s;t be &s;poken of only as Probable; a Score of them may make the thing more Probable, but don't make it Certain: Probabilities make no Demon&s;tration; Probable Signs are not Conclu&s;ive. There are two Errors in laying down Signs; one is when tho&s;e things that may flow from Common Principles, as natural Temper, natural Con&s;cience, fear of Hell, fal&s;e Imaginations, are given as &s;ure Signs of Grace: But tho&s;e things that may flow from Common Principles, don't truly di|&s;tingui&s;h between Saints &amp; Hypocrites; As a good Conver&s;ation, &s;avoury Di&s;cour&s;e, zeal again&s;t Sin, &s;trong religious Affections, &s;orrow for Sin, quietne&s;s under Afflictions, delight in Ordinances, &s;uffering for Religion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> From &s;uch loo&s;e Signs People are in danger to take up a fal&s;e Per&s;wa&s;ion of their godline&s;s. Such Signs are full of Delu&s;ion; and many men do ble&s;s them&s;elves who are in a mi&s;erable Condition. Such probable Signs may be, where there be certain Signs of the contrary. Men are apt to flatter them&s;elves, and when they hear &s;uch Signs, they are &s;trengthned in their carnal Confi|dence. There is no infallible Sign of Grace, but Grace. Grace is known only by intui|tion: All the External Effects of Grace may flow from other Cau&s;es. Another Error is
<PB N="18" REF="002585_0024_0FDB744139A17E88">
when men are too &s;trict in their Signs; As when they give that as a Sign, that there is a con&s;tant care to glorify GOD, and a continual living upon JESUS CHRIST, and a con&s;tant watchfulne&s;s again&s;t the workings of Corruption. There is no godly man but has at times ill frames of &s;pirit: <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Jonah</HI> and <HI>Peter</HI> had &s;o.

<P N="6">6. <HI>If any teach men to build their faith about the Divine Authority of the Scripture upon Pro|bable Signs, that is not good Preaching.</HI> There be many probable Arguments for the Authority of the Sacred Scriptures; As the Eminency of the Penmen, and they have had a mighty Efficacy to make a change in the Hearts of men; it is &s;aid there were many Miracles wrought for the confirmation of the Doctrine of them; there has been an

The&s;e Arguments are prepon|derating and do outweigh all Objections that are brought again&s;t the Authority of them: The&s;e Con&s;iderations may well &s;trengthen the Faith of the People of God; but the&s;e things cannot be the Foundation of our Faith: it is only the certain Knowledge of their Authority, that can be the foundation of Faith or any other Grace. Men cannot believe them to be infallibly true upon probable Arguments: Probable Arguments mu&s;t be looked on but as Probable and not Convincing. Men mu&s;t have infallible Ar|guments for loving God and believing His Word; the foundation of Believing the Di|vine Authority of the Scripture, is the manife&s;tation of the Divine Glory in them. There is a Self-evidencing Light in the Works of God: The Creation of the world &s;hews God's Power and God-head, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1.20. It is impo&s;&s;ible that the World &s;hould be made by any but an infinite God. So there is a Self-evidencing light in the Word of God; there are &s;uch things Revealed there as can be made known by none but God: 1 Cor. 2.9. <HI>Eye hath not &s;een, nor ear heard, nor hath it entred into the heart of man to con|ceive what God hath prepared for them that love him.</HI> Tho&s;e Eternal Rewards that are

Some men are but lax Ca&s;ui&s;ts, and they take too great a Liberty them&s;elves, &amp; &s;o do their Wives &amp; Children, and they are afraid to anger men by Re|proving &s;ome particular Evils that men are addicted to, that do prevail in the Land: The Phari&s;ees were &s;uch Ca&s;ui&s;ts; Mat. 5.43. <HI>Ye have heard it hath been &s;aid of old, thou &s;halt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.</HI> Men &s;hould be &s;olemnly Warned again&s;t all evil Carriages; and if this be omitted, it gives

God complains of ill again&s;t Teachers for not Reproving Sinners; I&s;a. 56.10. <HI>They are ignorant &amp; blind, dumb dogs that cannot bark.</HI> If men were duely Reproved for their Ex|travagancies, that would be a means to Re|claim them: Jer. 23.22. <HI>If they had &s;tood in my coun&s;el I had cau&s;ed my people to hear my words; then they &s;hould have turned them from their evil way and from the evil of their doings.</HI> Faithful Preaching would be beneficial two ways; one way as it would cut off occa&s;ions of anger, and prevent tho&s;e &s;ins that bring down the Wrath of God on the Land; we &s;hould enjoy much more Publick Pro&s;perity: The other is, that it would deliver men from tho&s;e Vicious Practi&s;es that are a great hindrance to Conver&s;ion. As long as men live in ways of Intemperance, Inju&s;tice, and un&s;uitable Carriages on the Sabbath, it will be a great impediment to a thorough work of Conver&s;ion. There may be Conver&s;ion tho' men are not broken off from &s;ins of Ignorance, but as long as they tolerate them|&s;elves in <HI>Immoralities,</HI> that will be a mighty Bar in the way of their Conver&s;ion.</P>

There is a great fault in Hearers, they are not &s;tudious of the mind of God; they are Enemies to the go&s;pel: And when Chri&s;t Him&s;elf Preached among them, many did not Pro|fit by it.
