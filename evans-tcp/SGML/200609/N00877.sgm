<HEAD>THE LOYAL ADDRESS OF THE Clergy of Virginia.</HEAD>
<L>MAY it plea&s;e you dread Sir, we the Clerks of <HI>Virginia,</HI></L>
<L>Who pray for Tobacco, and Preach for a Guinea,</L>
<L>Patroon'd to Contempt, and by favour made Elves,</L>
<L>For Troopers are Li&s;ted and pay Tythes to our Selves.</L>
<L>The meane&s;t Brigade of Your Maje&s;ties <HI>Grub&s;treets,</HI></L>
<L>Tho' Late; not lea&s;t Loyal of Your Clerical Subjects,</L>
<L>Among Crouds of <HI>True Hearts</HI> that of late do Addre&s;s You,</L>
<L>In our humble Phra&s;e do Crave Leave to Carre&s;s You</L>
<L>To &s;hew for Your Safety how with Zeal we burn all,</L>
<L>Under the Reverend <HI>James Blare</HI> our Collonel.</L>
<L>And here we cann't choo&s;e but proclaim our Re&s;entment,</L>
<L>That we mar'l what the Devil the Politick <HI>French</HI> meant:</L>
<L>In Affront to Your Per&s;on, and the Throne that You &s;it on,</L>
<L>To Dub the Young <HI>Bricklair</HI> the King of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></L>
<L>Tho' we are not with &s;ome &s;o high pufft with the Pty&s;ick,</L>
<L>As to &s;ay 'tis a Breach of the Treaty of <HI>Re&s;wick</HI>;</L>
<L>Yet we boldly averr, and by Words do a&s;&s;ure it</L>
<L>To be &s;uch a Contempt, we can never indure it:</L>
<L>Wherefore if Your Foes do per&s;i&s;t for to &s;light You,</L>
<L>We will all of us Pray, nay and &s;ome of us Fight too:</L>
<L>For like <HI>Hogans</HI> half drunk, Your Polemicks I fancy</L>
<L>Can Club prety well when In&s;pir'd with <HI>Nant&s;y,</HI></L>
<L>Among all the Black Guard You Cann't mi&s;s of an Hector,</L>
<L>Unle&s;s You chance light on the <HI>Williamburg</HI> Rector:</L>
<L>Yet we'll favour the <HI>French</HI> if we find they'l be Civil,</L>
<L>For be it known that we fear 'em no more than the Devil:</L>
<L>However we chan huff it, if they never come near us,</L>
<L>If they &s;hould I am afraid they would damnably &s;care us&punc;</L>
<L>Then to &s;ave our own Skins, and to &s;ilence Gain&s;aiers,</L>
<L>We'll leave of our bouncing and fall to our Prayers.</L>
<L>May kind Heavens pre&s;erve long Your Maje&s;ties good Soul,</L>
<L>And bring <HI>Lewis</HI> to beg a loath'd life at Your Foot&s;tool:</L>
<L>May <HI>Mantanoon</HI> Pox his Black Soul to the Devil,</L>
<L>And <HI>Burgundy</HI> Rot with his putred Kings Evil:</L>
<L>May young D' <HI>Anjoy</HI> be tru&s;t at the arm of the Main-yard,</L>
<L>And <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;s the Command of the <HI>Spaniard:</HI></L>
<L>May all Factious Di&s;tinctions henceforth be forgotten,</L>
<L>Nor Your Spiritual Pedlers be Contrould by a <HI>Scotch</HI> one:</L>
<L>May your Health in your College go Loyally Round,</L>
<L>And all your Leige People have Twelve-pence a Pound.</L>
