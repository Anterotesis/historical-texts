<P>ENGAGED, profe&s;&s;ionally, for a number of years in the direction of theatres, an intimate acquaintance with dramatic authors, early as well as modern, was an unavoidable con&s;equence: the plays of Lillo, preeminently claim attention; the pure ethics, the &s;triking example, the power|ful &s;ympathy, inculcated and excited in them, together with the &s;ublime and nervous &s;implicity of his language, and pathos of his characters, rank him high as a dramati&s;t: an elegant <HI>French Critic</HI> quotes &s;ome &s;cenes of Lillo's <HI>George Barnwell,</HI> as "a &s;tandard of dramatic writing." To the mutations of manners, in part, and to the improved &s;tate of the Engli&s;h &s;tage, are a&s;cribable, that extreme &s;en&s;ibility, and refine|ment of ta&s;te, which condemn the plays of this author to the clo&s;et: to purge the pa&s;&s;ions by &s;cenes of terror and agony, is no longer held as an e&s;|&s;ential of the Tragic Mu&s;e! The Play of "<HI>Fatal Curio&s;ity</HI>" has been frequently exhibited under the direction of that excellent critic, the

late Mr. Colman; but the &s;ombre tints of the &s;ubject, the undivided intere&s;t of the incidents, chaining the mind to the heart-rending cata&s;|trophe, (after repeated efforts, on the part of the public, to reli&s;h the bold, but terrific colour|ing of Lillo) returned it to the &s;helf; &s;ealed up from future repre&s;entations, by faintings, groans, and every other po&s;&s;ible expre&s;&s;ion of agony, in the audience.</P>
<P>Impre&s;&s;ed with its merit, and &s;edulou&s;ly pur|&s;uing every re&s;earch for the public amu&s;ement, I took the Play to pieces, and interwove with it an epi&s;odical plot; with a view, by dividing the at|tention, without weakening the intere&s;t of the original, to relieve the incidents; and the cour&s;e of events opening a probable medium for chang|ing the cata&s;trophe, I adopted, it:&mdash;In the per|formance it has an&s;wered my mo&s;t &s;anguine ex|pectations.</P>
<P>If the admirers of Lillo, in his maje&s;tic ter|rors, will forgive the freedom I have u&s;ed; if the public can reap one additiona gratification at the theatre from my labours, my object is com|pletely attained. I write not for applau&s;e; my
