<HEAD>TO THE PUBLIC.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT a fortnight ago a large packet was dropped in my &s;tore in the du&s;k of the evening, as I &s;uppo&s;e. It remained un|noticed till next morning, when, happening to perceive it, I opened it, and, among&s;t other written papers, found a letter directed to me, which is &s;ubjoined.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of that day and the next, I occa&s;ionally dipped into the papers; but as to &s;ell books, not to critici&s;e them, is my bu|&s;ine&s;s, all I &s;hall &s;ay is, that the &s;tyle, if we con&s;ider that the work is but a tran&s;lation, is tolerably &s;mooth and ea&s;y; and the &s;enti|ments (due allowance being made for the di&s;po&s;ition and education of an Algerine) are not unworthy of the public attention.</P>
<P>As the&s;e &s;tates abound in critics equal to any in the world, it may be pre&s;umed, that &s;ome of them will conde&s;cend to read the book which they critici&s;e. If the&s;e gentle|men will favour me with their remarks, they
<PB N="vi" REF="020481_0005_0FAF13272B3245F8">
&s;hall be added, by way of appendix, to the third or fourth impre&s;&s;ion. This addition will increa&s;e the value of the work, by ren|dering it at once more bulky and amu&s;ing.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s that, although a book&s;eller, I am not fond of large volumes. A huge folio has an impo&s;ing air of dignity, which is very apt to deter people from having any thing to &s;ay to it, as my &s;helves can te&s;tify; but a &s;nug little pocket volume, neatly bound and lettered, is like an ea&s;y good natured friend, who is ready to &s;it down with us near a good fire, or to take a walk on the com|mons. If we happen to be otherwi&s;e engag|ed, we part from the one, or pocket the other, without trouble or ceremony.</P>
<P>As for the Algerine gentleman, I declare upon the word of a faithful citizen, that I do not know him. If he has ever favoured me with his cu&s;tom, I am highly obliged to him, and, when he gets rid of his melancho|ly, I &s;hall be happy in pre&s;enting him with a copy of the work and a gla&s;s of wine into

<P>AS the publication of the herewith en|clo&s;ed letters will probably excite &s;ome de|gree of curio&s;ity concerning <HI>MEHEMET,</HI> the &s;py, I wi&s;h it were in my power to gratify it.

<DATELINE>GIBRALTAR.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I parted from thee, a train of ideas, at once melancholy and plea&s;ing, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my mind. I was con&s;cious, that I had undertaken an office of the highe&s;t con&s;equence to my country and the Mu&s;&s;elman faith; that, if &s;ucce&s;sful, I &s;hould rank with tho&s;e, who have gained immortal honour in this world, and the joys of Paradi&s;e; that, if un&s;ucce&s;sful, I &s;hould &s;uffer di&s;grace and impri&s;onment, (death I di&s;regard) pitied by men of &s;en&s;ibility and in&s;ulted by fools and knaves. I ingenuou&s;ly confe&s;s, that I was greatly dejected; but was relieved from this anxiety of mind (if relief it
<PB N="12" REF="020481_0009_0FB0E4C17A33B820">
could be called) by the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ickne&s;s I had ever experienced. My head grew giddy; a nau&s;ea &s;ucceeded; large drops of cold &s;weat i&s;&s;ued from every pore; with difficulty I &s;taggerd to my bed, and, cla&s;ping my hands, recom|mended my &s;oul to Allah. I &s;lumbered, as I &s;uppo&s;e, about four hours; when, finding my&s;elf con&s;iderably better, I ven|tured on deck.</P>
<P>To thee, who, from a very early period of thy life, ha&s;t been accu&s;tomed to hard|&s;hips and perils on this turbulent element, this account of my &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s will ap|pear perfectly ridiculous. If I expected to excite compa&s;&s;ion, I would have ad|dre&s;&s;ed this letter to the gallant leader of our warlike troops, or the venerable in|terpreter of our mo&s;t holy law. The fir&s;t has often experienced dangers in the con|flict of arms, and the no le&s;s perilous in|trigues of a court; but I am confident, that his tremors have been greater du|ring a voyage to Con&s;tantinople, than when expo&s;ed to the roaring cannon or the equally de&s;tructive whi&s;pers of court-&s;ycophants.

<PB N="13" REF="020481_0011_0FB0E4C477B8C158">
The la&s;t has never been at &s;ea; but he has often read with exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility the de&s;cription of a voyage by the royal I&s;raelite.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not trouble thee with a minute account of my di&s;tre&s;&s;es during the whole voyage; the offen&s;ive &s;inell and ta&s;te of the water; the roughne&s;s of the captain, which I at fir&s;t mi&s;took for brutality, or the &s;neers of the &s;ailors, who, having been informed that I was a Frenchman, re|garded me with eyes at once expre&s;&s;ive of hatred and contempt.</P>
<P>Thou mu&s;t remember, that when my propo&s;al of embarking for the American continent was accepted, it was &s;ugge&s;ted to me to appear in the character of a na|tive of the &s;outh of France. My know|ledge of the French language, the predi|lection of the citizens of the new &s;tates for their allies, and the &s;warthine&s;s of my complexion, induced me to follow this advice. This circum&s;tance expo&s;ed me to the in&s;ults which I have ju&s;t mention|ed. But the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the weighty
<PB N="14" REF="020481_0012_0FB0E4C7A188E278">
commi&s;&s;ion, with which I was charged, repre&s;&s;ed my re&s;entment. I conver&s;ed with them freely in Engli&s;h, which I un|der&s;tand perfectly and &s;peak with tolera|ble fluency; and very &s;oon conciliated their favour. They partook of my wine, and liberally offered me their grog, which is a mixture of water and a &s;pirituous li|quor, highly e&s;teemed by the inhabitants of the new world. The di&s;pen&s;ation, which I obtained, permitting me to drink wine, mu&s;t, I think, include all ferment|ed and even di&s;tilled liquors. But as wine only is mentioned, I beg you will con&s;ult our great &s;piritual guide on this occa&s;ion, and inform me of his &s;acred de|termination.</P>
<P>After a &s;hort voyage I landed ye&s;ter|day in the bay under a promontory, which with a di&s;dainful &s;uperiority, looks down on the ocean, and even its brother Ceuta on the oppo&s;ite coa&s;t. It has been in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Engli&s;h more than eighty years, who took it from the Spaniards, and, notwith&s;tanding &s;everal attacks and &s;ieges, are &s;till ma&s;ters of it.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="020481_0013_0FB0E4C990474838">Thou maye&s;t remember with what &s;tu|pidity both the&s;e nations were charged by &s;everal of our countrymen during the la&s;t war, the one for attacking, the other for defending this u&s;ele&s;s rock, as it was ra&s;h|ly termed. But their accu&s;ations would have cea&s;ed, had they con&s;idered, that this Pillar of Hercules is no incon&s;idera|ble prop of Briti&s;h opulence and glory.</P>
<P>I lodge in the hou&s;e of Solomon Mendez, a Jewi&s;h merchant, to whom I brought letters of introduction, and &s;hall &s;oon embark for Li&s;bon, from which port I &s;hall take pa&s;&s;age for the new world.</P>

<P>IT may be di&s;puted, whether the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of this rock has been beneficial to Great Britain. The expence of defend|ing it has been perhaps greater than the commercial advantages derived from it. But it is undoubtedly true, that the Sub|lime Porte and its dependencies in the Mediterranean, are highly intere&s;ted in its continuing under its pre&s;ent ma&s;ters. No true Spaniard can behold it without indignation, and con&s;equently a wi&s;h, that it &s;hould be reunited to the kingdom from which it was violently rent, and has been ignominiou&s;ly retained. It has been, I believe, the principal &s;ource of enmity betwixt Spain and Britain, &s;ince it was conquered, and has induced the former nation to co-operate with France in all her plans for reducing the power of the latter. Spain, if repo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Gibraltar, would probably abate of her attachment to France, to who&s;e views, it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed,
<PB N="18" REF="020481_0016_0FB0E4CE943C5FC8">
&s;he has long been blindly &s;ub&s;er|vient. The lo&s;s of that va&s;t tract of country in America, now called the United States, by dimini&s;hing the power of Britain in that quarter of the globe, has le&s;&s;ened the terrors, and con&s;equently the enmity of Spain. A new nation has &s;tarted up in America, which, if actuated by ambition, (and what power has long re&s;i&s;ted its impul&s;e) may invade, hara&s;s and &s;ubjugate &s;everal of the Spani&s;h pro|vinces. The enthu&s;ia&s;m of the invaders, the debility of the invaded, the poverty of the &s;tates and the wealth of the pro|vinces, will render the conque&s;t of Peru and Mexico by no means difficult. The Bourbon union already regards the Ame|rican confederacy with a jealous eye, and will never forgive this new people for having it in their power to attack their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the we&s;t, although the temp|tation may be re&s;i&s;ted for a long &s;eries of years.</P>
<P>The wars among&s;t the chri&s;tian powers have generally, I might &s;ay invariably, promoted the intere&s;t of the Ottoman
<PB N="19" REF="020481_0017_0FB0E4D0E296EB60">
empire. Here then is a certain &s;ource of animo&s;ity, which mu&s;t advance the &s;plendor and power of the Porte, and may re&s;tore thou&s;ands of Moori&s;h fami|lies to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their e&s;tates in the fertile, but neglected provinces of Spain.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t here permit me to make a &s;hort digre&s;&s;ion in favour of toleration. Had Spain, when &s;he threw off the Moor|i&s;h yoke, permitted tho&s;e people to re|tain their religion, &s;he would &s;till have held the fir&s;t rank among&s;t the powers of Europe. Moderation would have recon|ciled our forefathers, or, at all events, their immediate offspring, to the &s;uper&s;ti|tions of the Nazarenes. They were un|doubtedly an indu&s;trious, as well as a brave and intelligent people. Their ex|pul&s;ion weakened Spain at lea&s;t as much, as the bani&s;hment of the prote&s;tants re|duced the internal re&s;ources of France in the reign of Lewis the XIVth. I &s;hall not attempt a regular di&s;&s;ertation on the fatal effects of religious intolerance; but &s;hall only remind thee, that the followers of Mahomet have been more indulgent
<PB N="20" REF="020481_0018_0FB0E4D3106868B0">
to tho&s;e who profe&s;s chri&s;tianity, than the different &s;ects of chri&s;tians have frequent|ly been to each other.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that there are &s;chi&s;ms even in our holy religion. The di&s;ciples of Hali (not to mention inferior &s;ects) differ in &s;ome particulars from the followers of our prophet; but we defy the mo&s;t virulent chri&s;tian to prove, that either the Ottoman or Per&s;ian govern|ment has racked, burned, or even impri|&s;oned, on a religious account, tho&s;e who di&s;&s;ent from the e&s;tabli&s;hed mode of wor|&s;hip in the&s;e re&s;pective countries. Some brutal Turks and Per&s;ians have been known, it is true, to &s;peak in&s;ultingly to, and even &s;pit upon, a chri&s;tian in the &s;treets. But in all po&s;&s;ible ca&s;es the di&s;|pen&s;ers of ju&s;tice never fail to redre&s;s the injury by puni&s;hing the aggre&s;&s;or. Here then lies the difference between maho|metans and chri&s;tians in this particular; the rabble among&s;t us are &s;ometimes guil|ty of religious rancour; but in chri&s;tian countries, per&s;ecution always proceeds from tho&s;e who are, or at lea&s;t are &s;up|po&s;ed

<P>MY ho&s;t, I have already informed thee, is a Jew. Thou wilt con&s;equently &s;uppo&s;e him to be guilty of tho&s;e vices too generally attributed to his degenerate nation. Tho&s;e, of whom thou ha&s;t any knowledge, living under a government which de&s;pi&s;es, in&s;ults, and even robs them of the fruits of their indu&s;try, are nece&s;&s;arily re&s;erved in their conver&s;ation and au&s;tere in their dome&s;tic concerns. If poor, they are &s;coffed at by the popu|lace; if rich, they are plundered by their &s;uperiors. But in Gibraltar (and I be|lieve throughout the Briti&s;h dominions) they are as fully protected as any other denomination of men. They are, it is true, excluded by law from all the offices of &s;tate, nor can they purcha&s;e lands. But as their commerce is exten&s;ive, their influence is by no means incon&s;iderable. Their immen&s;e property in the national
<PB N="23" REF="020481_0021_0FB0E4DA95101ED0">
funds gives them a degree of weight equally advantageous to them&s;elves and the public. They are by intere&s;t, the &s;tronge&s;t of all ties, attached to the coun|try which protects them, and by their corre&s;pondence with each other, how|ever widely di&s;per&s;ed, are enabled to col|lect intelligence of all the de&s;igns of fo|reign cabinets. It may occa&s;ion &s;ome a&s;toni&s;hment, that Britain, which liberal|ly encourages their commercial enterpri|&s;es, &s;hould preclude them from po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing landed property. I will not &s;ay, that this prohibition proceeds altogether from wi&s;|dom; but I am induced to think, that it has been productive of the happie&s;t con|&s;equences. If the Hebrews had been permitted to purcha&s;e lands, many of them would have become mere farmers; an u&s;eful race of men, I confe&s;s, but on a narrow &s;cale, if compared with mer|chants. The cultivator of the earth in a country not arrived at maturity, is un|que&s;tionably the fir&s;t character; but in a more advanced &s;tate of &s;ociety he mu&s;t yield to the merchant. In the former &s;tate the landholder a&s;&s;i&s;ts his country
<PB N="24" REF="020481_0022_0FB0E4DC7B8409C8">
&s;imply by his own exertions, or tho&s;e of his immediate relatives, and may be ju&s;t|ly deemed a patriot; in the latter, the merchant, by advancing the credit of his nation and often by depre&s;&s;ing that of the enemy, by a few &s;trokes of his pen creates fleets and armies, and often without blood&s;hed in&s;ures &s;ucce&s;s. He is equally a patriot and more of the &s;tate&s;|man than the landholder.</P>
<P>Our imagination is highly delighted, when we read the hi&s;tories of ancient Greece and Rome. We are dazzled by the &s;plendor of their victories, and are apt to attribute more prai&s;e to them, than they de&s;erve. But Alexander, at the head of united and victorious Greece, paid the highe&s;t tribute to the utility of commerce. If, in the madne&s;s of fal&s;e heroi&s;m, he de&s;troyed Tyre, he endea|voured to repair the injury by founding Alexandria; and Rome, incapable, by her genius, of commercial greatne&s;s, was long retarded in her progre&s;s to univer|&s;al dominion by the policy, wealth and valour of Carthage. Hence this &s;tate
<PB N="25" REF="020481_0023_0FB0E4DE06311158">
was entitled to her particular hatred; others &s;he merely conquered and en&s;la|ved; but Carthage &s;he utterly de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>It might be entertaining, and perhaps u&s;eful, to trace the probable progre&s;s of Carthaginian power, if, in the la&s;t Pu|nic war, &s;he had &s;ubdued her imperious rival. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, at that time, of a very lucrative commerce, &s;he would have aim|ed at extending it. Conque&s;t would have been but her &s;econdary object. Her daring navigators had already vi&s;ited all the di&s;covered parts of the world, and had made con&s;iderable progre&s;s along the coa&s;t of Africa, lying on the Atlantic ocean, towards the equator. After a few more attempts, they would have doubled the cape of Good Hope, and the trea|&s;ures of the ea&s;t would have rewarded her beneficial indu&s;try. That nation, which the &s;ilver mines of Spain, at that time the Mexico of Europe, could not corrupt or enervate, would have pro&s;ecuted her plan with the genuine &s;pirit of com|merce, which encourages a degree of foreign indu&s;try, as the reward of &s;upe|rior
<PB N="26" REF="020481_0024_0FB0E4DF89D1BBA0">
&s;kill and exertion. Her factories would have increa&s;ed to cities; the&s;e cities, by a happy contagion, would have acquired over the adjacent countries a &s;pecies of dominion, which, being found|ed on mutual benefits, would have no le&s;s advanced the intere&s;ts, than con|ciliated the affection of the original in|habitants. War, as I have &s;aid, would have been moderately attended to. Re|lea&s;ed from the dread of a rival, &s;he would have levied armies and equipped fleets &s;olely to maintain (allow me the expre&s;&s;ion) the police of the world.</P>

<P>I HAVE given thee an imaginary &s;ketch of the probable power of Carthage, (if &s;he had &s;ubdued her rival) a name, which ought to be mentioned in the an|nals of Africa with no le&s;s honour than Egypt her&s;elf. Let us now review the effects, which the ambition of Rome pro|duced in the human character.</P>
<P>That nation, which boa&s;ted its origin from the union of robbers, was nece&s;&s;ari|ly, even in its infancy, incited to war by the hope of plunder. Incapable of in|du&s;try, and confined within very narrow limits, the Romans could not exi&s;t with|out di&s;tre&s;&s;ing their neighbours. Having e&s;tabli&s;hed a place of refuge for malefac|tors, their numbers rapidly increa&s;ed by the acce&s;&s;ion of all the banditti of Italy. Their fir&s;t chief was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the &s;on of Mars. His actions cor|re&s;ponded with his pretended birth. The
<PB N="28" REF="020481_0026_0FB0E4E4B970F4C0">
murder of his brother in&s;pired his follow|ers with the highe&s;t opinion of his hero|i&s;m. Who more fit to reign, &s;aid they, than he, who is not re&s;trained by the ties of nature? This &s;entiment pervaded all their de&s;igns, and was infu&s;ed into their children. It was glorious not only to die for their country, but to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate their enemies, and even to kill their own offspring.</P>
<P>Thou art &s;en&s;ible, that I am not in|dulging a romantic fancy. Every page of the earlier part of their hi&s;tory is &s;tain|ed with in&s;idious a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination or open murder. A Scaevola is recorded as a hero, for having thru&s;t into the flames the hand which failed to murder a king at open war with his nation; and a Bru|tus is exalted to almo&s;t divine honors for having condemned to die two of his &s;ons, whom the laws of his country might have bani&s;hed without his unnatural interven|tion.</P>
<P>But thou wilt &s;ay, that the Romans were, at the period I allude to, emerging
<PB N="29" REF="020481_0027_0FB0E4E636E1BE60">
from barbari&s;m; that great &s;ouls, unen|lightened by found philo&s;ophy and true religion, are nece&s;&s;arily guilty of exce&s;|&s;es. That they were barbarians at this period, is granted; but let me a&s;k thee, at what time were they enlightened? Their kings, with the &s;ole exception of Numa, were the worthy leaders of the greate&s;t de&s;perados we read of. Their perpetual wars in Italy (I might have called them ma&s;&s;acres) ought to have united the whole world again&s;t them, as the pe&s;ts of human nature.</P>
<P>Nor can we attribute their ferocious exploits to the examples of their kings. After the regal authority was aboli&s;hed, their ambition was in&s;atiable. Italy &s;oon became too narrow a &s;pace for their cru|elty and thir&s;t of fal&s;e glory. Having re|pelled Pyrrhus, who had brought &s;uc|cours to his allies, the Tarentines, they attacked Sicily, at that time allied with Carthage. This war rou&s;ed the Cartha|ginians, who being hitherto chiefly em|ployed in commercial pur&s;uits, or engag|ed in war as an inferior object, could not
<PB N="30" REF="020481_0028_0FB0E4E7CB9EABA0">
behold the encroachments and u&s;urpati|ons of the Romans without feeling a ju&s;t re&s;entment. They armed, they fought; and after experiencing triumphs as well as defeats, were exterminated by their ungenerous rivals.</P>
<P>Thus fell Carthage, the emporium of commerce, the nur&s;ery of humanity! And &s;o implacable was the fury of her conquerors, or &s;o de&s;tructive have been the ravages of time, that the works of her arti&s;ts, and the writings of her poets, &s;tate&s;men and philo&s;ophers are no where to be found, except the comedies of Te|rence and the Periplous of Hanno.</P>
<P>Perhaps I have heightened this picture from a predilection for a people, who were the ornament of Africa, and ma&s;ters of the place of my nativity; but I am of opinion, that every impartial per&s;on who reviews the Roman hi&s;tory with the eye of philo&s;ophy, mu&s;t execrate the in&s;idious policy and unbounded ambition of that re&s;tle&s;s and domineering people.</P>

<P>ALTHOUGH comfortably lodged, I am impatient to enter on my office; but am doubtful, whether I &s;hall take, pa&s;&s;age from &s;ome port in France for America, or from Li&s;bon. In the mean time my ho&s;t, to whom alone the object of my travels is known, endeavours to render my abode in this place as agree|able as po&s;&s;ible. He has introduced me to all his acquaintance, &s;ome of whom are men of letters; the re&s;t are mer|chants.

In deportment an Algerine, a Frenchman in dre&s;s and language, I was at fir&s;t the object of their amazement; but after the &s;econd vi&s;it it abated, and I am no long|er the theme of their whi&s;pers.

and timid, I at fir&s;t blu&s;hed when &s;poken to and an&s;wered their que&s;tions with diffidence and he&s;itation. Strange, thought I that the man, who, in his haram, in&s;pired awe and even terror, &s;hould in his turn, be awed into &s;ilence, and &s;hrink from the eye of female ob|&s;ervation! But I &s;oon &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the&s;e unmanly feelings, and entered into the &s;pirit of their conver&s;ation, which was decent and lively.</P>
<P>Thou wilt probably be amu&s;ed with an account of our conver&s;ation. We were &s;eated in a large room, which was rendered as cool as po&s;&s;ible by a free ad|mi&s;&s;ion of air; but the ladies, who&s;e con&s;titutions, I pre&s;ume, were more &s;u&s;|ceptible of heat, than tho&s;e of the men, kept fanning them&s;elves perpetually, com|plaining, at every pau&s;e in the conver|&s;ation, of the inten&s;e heat of the wea|ther. They frequently ro&s;e from their &s;eats with &s;eeming hurry, and, &s;tepping ha&s;tily to a mirror, adju&s;ted their neck-dre&s;&s;es with the greate&s;t compo&s;ure. Their conver&s;ation was as unguarded,
<PB N="33" REF="020481_0031_0FB0E4F00F7F9720">
as their looks and motions. They &s;poke of their ab&s;ent friends without re&s;erve, and &s;ometimes with acrimony; that a matron was anxious to be divorced from her hu&s;band, and that a virgin was eager to elope with her lover. I heard with a&s;toni&s;hment more than three female voices at a time. A di&s;cour&s;e directed to one lady, was interrupted by another, and the half-uttered que&s;tion was muti|lated by the premature an&s;wer. A lap|dog occa&s;ionally attracted their notice, which, by turns, they fondled, ki&s;&s;ed and even &s;poke to with all the rapture of maternal tenderne&s;s.</P>
<P>This &s;cene, which, if related to me, I &s;hould &s;carcely have believed, was inter|rupted by a man, &s;uperbly, but fanciful|ly dre&s;t, bearing in both hands an ob|long japanned machine, on which &s;everal beautiful ve&s;&s;els were arranged, filled with a &s;moaking liquid. Imagining him to be one of the gue&s;ts, I ro&s;e from my &s;eat and bowed to him according to the Nazarene fa&s;hion. A roar of laughter proceeded from the females, and even
<PB N="34" REF="020481_0032_0FB0E4F5B64CE8D0">
gentlemen could &s;carcely ab&s;tain from &s;miling, whil&s;t a blu&s;h of &s;en&s;ibility over|&s;pread the cheek of the attendant; for &s;uch I now di&s;covered him to be. He pre&s;ented the japanned uten&s;il to each of the company in turn, who took hold of a &s;pecies of plate which &s;upported the ve&s;&s;el, filled with the hot liquor. This was &s;ipped by all the company with evi|dent marks of &s;atisfaction, although but a few minutes before they had all com|plained of the inten&s;e heat of the wea|ther. Having attentively ob&s;erved the ceremonial, I was not at a lo&s;s how to act. But as the attendant approached me, his blu&s;hes were renewed and the laugh was repeated, although not &s;o ob|&s;treperou&s;ly as at fir&s;t. Ju&s;t at this in|&s;tant a boy entered in great agitation, and whi&s;pered his bu&s;ine&s;s in the ear of a lady, who was ob&s;erved immediately to turn pale. A dozen e&s;&s;ence-bottles were in&s;tantly applied to her no&s;trile, and as many fans were in motion. I was truly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for the lady; but what was my &s;urpri&s;e, when I was inform|ed, that her fainting was occa&s;ioned by

a misfortune, which had happened to her monkey, who, in attempting to climb a tree, had fallen and &s;lipped his &s;houl|der. She &s;ighed, wept and wrung her hands, whil&s;t tears of &s;ympathy trickled down the cheek of the&s;e tender hearted ladies. At length the fair mourner, &s;up|ported by two of her particular friends, was conducted to an inner apartment in all the dignity of &s;orrow. I embra|ced this opportunity of retiring to my apartment, by no means edified by a company where the ab&s;ent had been ma|ligned, a &s;tranger in&s;ulted, and a dog care&s;&s;ed; and where more &s;orrow had been lavi&s;hed on a monkey, than would have been felt for an expiring child.</P>
<P>How different, my friend, are the&s;e women from the beloved of my &s;oul; who is more intent to hear, than eager to &s;peak; who, &s;atisfied with my love, aims not at the admiration of others&punc; with whom &s;ilence is wi&s;dom and re&s;erve is virtue!</P>

<P>AS &s;oon as the company had retired, my friend entered my apartment, and in|formed me with great delicacy, that the aukwardne&s;s of my deportment had in|duced the gentlemen to make very par|ticular enquiries concerning me; that he had however &s;atisfied their curio&s;ity by informing them, that I was a French gentleman, addicted to &s;tudy and fond of retirement; that in &s;ome of the let|ters, which I brought with me, hints were given him of an apprehended de|rangement in my intellects, to prevent which, travelling had been pre&s;cribed by my phy&s;icians; but that, for his part, he believed I was only a philo&s;opher.

<P>I happened to mention, that the pre|&s;ent age was greatly indebted to ancient Greece for literature and &s;cience, and be&s;towed &s;ome encomiums on Ari&s;totle.

This in&s;tance of national pride reminded me of a &s;tory, pretended to be believed in the We&s;t; that an apo&s;tate Monk and a profligate Jew compo&s;ed the &s;acred al|koran, which our illu&s;trious prophet pro|mulgated for the benefit of the elect.

<P>MY ho&s;t is very de&s;irous of giving me an in&s;ight into the manners and amu&s;e|ments of the Nazarenes, that they may not appear altogether &s;trange to me on my arrival in the new world. He is ful|ly acquainted with the object of my tra|vels, and will doubtle&s;s be &s;ecret, be|cau&s;e it is his intere&s;t to be &s;o. To have attempted an enterpri&s;e of this nature, without imparting the &s;ecret to at lea&s;t two foreigners, would have been little &s;hort of madne&s;s. Although an oecono|mi&s;t by nature and habit, I may require more money than the &s;um I &s;hall take with me. To draw bills in the new &s;tates on a merchant at Algiers would expo&s;e me to inevitable de&s;truction, either from their government or the populace. I have therefore &s;ettled a mode of corre|&s;pondence with Solomon Mendez at this place, and &s;hall make &s;imilar arrange|ments at Li&s;bon with Mo&s;es d'Aco&s;ta.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="020481_0040_0FAF12A404BB8470">It may be a&s;ked, as I travel in the character of a French gentleman, why I have not e&s;tabli&s;hed a corre&s;pondence with &s;ome mercantile hou&s;e in France? To this I an&s;wer, that, although it is right, for many rea&s;ons, to a&s;&s;ume the character of a Frenchman, I think it highly dan|gerous to intru&s;t my &s;ecret with any of that nation. An affected or real attach|ment to the&s;e new republicans, the hope of conciliating their favour, or the dread of his own government, might induce a Frenchman to betray me. Even the va|nity of being the &s;ubject of public di&s;|cour&s;e might &s;timulate him to my ruin. But from Jews I apprehend no manner of danger. They will not betray me from either patrioti&s;m or vanity. Their im|mediate intere&s;t will prompt them to be faithful, and they have much to hope from my future patronage in Algiers.</P>
<P>I might immediately proceed through a part of Spain to Li&s;bon; but I &s;hall be le&s;s expo&s;ed to di&s;covery by taking pa&s;|&s;age in an Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;el. The mariners of that nation are rough and un&s;u&s;pici|ous.

When they hear I am a French|man, they will conclude they know the wor&s;t of me.</P>
<P>I had written thus far, when I was in|vited down &s;tairs to partake of the amu&s;e|ments of a ball. I accepted the invitati|on for two rea&s;ons. I am &s;uppo&s;ed to be a Frenchman; and a refu&s;al might have brought my country into que&s;tion. I am going to the American &s;tates; it is there|fore nece&s;&s;ary that I &s;hould be as much acquainted as po&s;&s;ible with the Engli&s;h fa&s;hions.</P>
<P>On my entering the room, I made a low bow (a circum&s;tance I am careful never to forget) and &s;eated my&s;elf in a chair, which &s;eparated two matrons, who&s;e re&s;pectable countenances challenged that veneration, which from their dre&s;s and behaviour they &s;eemed unwilling to claim. The hot liquid, which is called tea, was handed round in the manner, which I have already de&s;cribed. They drank it, becau&s;e, I pre&s;ume, they were cold; and they fanned them&s;elves immediately af|terwards,
<PB N="44" REF="020481_0042_0FAF12A5F4D65248">
becau&s;e, I am confident, they were hot. The conte&s;t betwixt the tea and the fan continued for &s;ome time. At length the tea retired, and the fan, which had received great a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the handkerchief, remained ma&s;ter of the field. The mu&s;icians now entered, and, having neglected to tune their in&s;tru|ments before their admi&s;&s;ion, reminded me of the di&s;cordant harmony mention|ed by one of the Roman poets. But this was probably done from the view of rendering by the contra&s;t their mu&s;ic doubly agreeable. The in&s;truments being now ready, I looked round with &s;ome impatience for the dancing girls, who, I &s;uppo&s;ed, were ready in the next room. In the mean time, a young gentleman, approaching with a hat in his hand, made me a low bow. I thought, I could do no le&s;s than make him another. He bowed again, and proceeded to another gentleman, who, after giving and re|ceiving a bow, took the hat, and walk|ing with becoming gravity towards one of the matrons, between whom I was &s;eated, bowed to her. To convince the
<PB N="45" REF="020481_0043_0FAF12A6795A9630">
company, that &s;he was both young and active, &s;he ro&s;e from her &s;eat with &s;uch agility, that her a&s;cending bo&s;om and his de&s;cending no&s;e were almo&s;t in contact. The gentleman threw back his right leg, and, drawing his left leg towards it, bowed mo&s;t profoundly, his eyes very mode&s;tly fixed on the ground during a few &s;econds. The lady with an air of complacency and dignity looking full in his face, and, placing both her hands on her wai&s;t before, gently threw back her left foot, and, in a manner, which I can|not de&s;cribe, &s;eemed &s;inking beneath the level of the floor; then ri&s;ing graceful|ly to her natural height, &s;he tendered him one of her hands, which he gently received with one of his. He now con|ducted her towards a door, which open|ed into another apartment. I at fir&s;t imagined they were going to enter it; but both &s;uddenly turning, he bowed, and &s;he &s;unk and ro&s;e again. The mu|&s;ic now began, and the lady expanded the lower part of her apparel in a man|ner to me altogether new and a&s;toni&s;hing. After a very &s;hort &s;pace, he bowed and
<PB N="46" REF="020481_0044_0FAF12A6EC86AA98">
&s;unk again, then both turning half round, the bowing and &s;inking was repeated. The gentleman with his right hand now took hold of the lady's left hand, (con|&s;equently only one half of her garments remained expanded) and both of them, moving &s;lowly and maje&s;tically, advanced towards the middle of the room, when, de&s;cribing nearly a &s;emicircle, they re|treated in oppo&s;ite directions. The lady's left hand, being now at liberty, re&s;tored her garment to its full expan&s;ion. They continued in motion about two or three minutes, approaching, cro&s;&s;ing and re|treating, when the lady, extending and waving her right hand in a mo&s;t bewitch|ing manner, the gentleman al&s;o extend|ed and waved his; and they advanced towards each other, till the tips of their fingers met. Then retreating and again advancing, their left hands performed the &s;ame graceful ceremony. They con|tinued approaching, cro&s;&s;ing and retreat|ing about two minutes longer, when the lady, with a langui&s;hing look, letting her garment drop into its natural po&s;ition, extended both her arms, and advanced
<PB N="47" REF="020481_0045_0FAF12A7C159D728">
to meet the gentleman, who with his arms al&s;o extended, approached her with more than u&s;ual bri&s;kne&s;s. After turning round, they repaired to the &s;pot, where the ceremony began, from which, after three more &s;inks and as many bows, the gentleman lead her to her &s;eat; and after one more bow and a concluding &s;ink retired.</P>
<P>This &s;erious mummery concluded, I imagined the dancing girls, according to the Algerine fa&s;hion, would be now in|troduced; but, to my great a&s;toni&s;hment, it was repeated by almo&s;t all the compa|ny. A pau&s;e of about ten minutes &s;uc|ceeded, when the ladies, having quitted their &s;eats, began to adju&s;t their dre&s;&s;es, which I could not perceive had been di&s;|compo&s;ed; their fans were not neglected and their handkerchiefs were well em|ployed. After &s;ome con&s;ultation, attend|ed with many bows and &s;inks, the males and females formed two di&s;tinct rows, each male oppo&s;ite to a female at about the di&s;tance of three feet. Hitherto their countenances had been &s;ettled and even
<PB N="48" REF="020481_0046_0FAF12A8807FAF80">
&s;evere, their conver&s;ation carried on in whi&s;pers, and their demeanor more ex|pre&s;&s;ive of devotion than fe&s;tivity; nay, I had been almo&s;t tempted to believe, that they had been engaged in performing &s;ome religious ceremonies, not unlike the rites of the ancient Corybantes, or the extatic evolutions of our holy dervi&s;es. But how was I deceived!&mdash;One of the mu&s;icians &s;tamping with his foot by way of &s;ignal, the &s;prightlie&s;t notes were heard. In an in&s;tant gravity was put to flight, and in my opinion, decorum &s;uffered not a little. Smiling, capering and nodding en&s;ued. A gentleman turned a lady round with one hand, then with the other; &s;ome|times three turned round together, &s;ome|times four, and, occa&s;ionally, even &s;ix. The circle appeared to me their favourite figure; but, to prevent giddine&s;s as I &s;up|po&s;e, they &s;ometimes practi&s;ed the right line. One figure gave me much &s;atisfac|tion, which, after &s;ome ob&s;ervation, I di&s;|covered to be the arithmetical 8.</P>
<P>Thus far they proceeded on mathema|tical principles; but in the cour&s;e of their
<PB N="49" REF="020481_0047_0FAF12A929B8B1D0">
fooleries, I thought I perceived a degree of my&s;tic morality. The lady at times fled from the gentleman, as if &s;he was of|fended; whil&s;t he, from the hope of ap|pea&s;ing her anger, followed her with be|coming tenderne&s;s; but deeming her im|placable, and con&s;cious of his own dig|nity, gives over the pur&s;uit and flies from her. She, ju&s;tly apprehen&s;ive of lo&s;ing him entirely, follows him in turn; a re|conciliation en&s;ues, and their hands are reunited. It was altogether the mo&s;t di|verting &s;cene I had ever beheld, and I had every rea&s;on to be plea&s;ed, that no hired dancing girls had been introduced. The ladies and gentlemen, &s;ome few in|advertencies (which ought not to be men|tioned) and one or two &s;lips, (attended with no bad con&s;equences) excepted, per|formed their parts with grace and agility, and, as I was the &s;ole &s;pectator, were en|titled to my warme&s;t applau&s;e.</P>

<P>I AM induced to think that &s;ea-&s;ick|ne&s;s re&s;embles the &s;mall-pox, with which we are never afflicted a &s;econd time; but I &s;peak with becoming diffidence, not chu&s;ing to build an hypothe&s;is on a &s;ingle fact.</P>
<P>My voyage from Gibraltar to this beau|tiful port was in every re&s;pect delightful. The winds were favourable and gentle, the &s;ea as &s;mooth as I could have wi&s;hed, and the azure of the &s;ky &s;eldom ob&s;cured by a cloud.

<P>Doubtle&s;s, thought I, if the &s;ea was never agitated by tempe&s;ts, a con&s;idera|ble part of mankind would prefer it for their abode; like the Chine&s;e and Hol|landers who, with their families, re&s;ide

on rivers in floating man&s;ions. Several occupations might be followed as well on the &s;ea as the land. Raw materials, &s;up|plied by the cultivator of the earth, might be manufactured by the inhabitants of the ocean. A tarif, regulating the com|merce of the terraqueous globe, might ea&s;ily be e&s;tabli&s;hed; fi&s;h might be bar|tered for fle&s;h and vegetables; and, &s;ince the ladies on both elements mu&s;t have ornaments, pearls might be exchanged for diamonds; nor would the powers of the earth have any rea&s;onable excu&s;e for waging war, as long as any part of the ocean remained uncolonized. Archime|des a&s;&s;erted, that, if he had but a &s;pot to &s;tand upon, he would play at tennis with the ball which we inhabit; for the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of my &s;y&s;tem, I require but the annihilation of tempe&s;ts. Nor &s;hould the &s;ea-&s;curvy be mentioned as an objection by the medical faculty, till the plague is eradicated by their &s;kill; the latter di&s;|order being at lea&s;t as de&s;tructive as the former.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="020481_0051_0FAF12ACF48D23E8">Before we pa&s;&s;ed the rock of Li&s;bon, I ob&s;erved a particular archne&s;s in the looks of the &s;ailors, which gave me no unea&s;ine&s;s, as I was acquainted with the cau&s;e of it. My friend, Solomon Men|dez, had informed me of a cu&s;tom among&s;t Engli&s;h mariners, of exacting a tribute from all on board on their fir&s;t &s;eeing this celebrated rock. I readily complied with an u&s;age which, like many others as per|tinaciou&s;ly adhered to, has no foundati|on in nature or rea&s;on.

<P>Thou art not unacquainted with the exertion of maritime enterpri&s;e and mili|tary prowe&s;s, which di&s;tingui&s;hed this people in the fifteenth century. The &s;e|crecy with which they conducted their plan of depo&s;ing king Philip, their pru|dence in chu&s;ing the duke of Braganza for their monarch, their conque&s;ts in A&s;ia, and their &s;ettlements in Africa and Ame|rica,

contributed to render them a rich and a glorious nation. They may even at pre&s;ent be con&s;idered as a people po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of a con&s;iderable &s;hare of commerce; but their national valour is no longer the theme of panegyric.</P>
<P>The mere hi&s;torian is capable of giving us a regular detail of events. It belongs to the philo&s;opher alone to trace the ri&s;e and fall of national character, and to in|ve&s;tigate tho&s;e cau&s;es, which exalt men to heroi&s;m, or &s;ink them in &s;ervitude. I confe&s;s my&s;elf unequal to the ta&s;k; but &s;hall only remark, that the revolution in Portugal was &s;imply a change of ma&s;ters. Don Juan was certainly a brave and hu|mane Prince; but the royal authority, on the depo&s;ition of Philip, was in no re&s;pect re&s;trained or regulated. Thus their political happine&s;s depending on the characters of their &s;ucceeding princes, the Portugueze have &s;hared the fate of other nations in &s;imilar circum&s;tances; they have been wi&s;ely governed.</P>

<P>THE Hebrew religion being odious to the people and obnoxious to the go|vernment, my ho&s;t is but little troubled with the company of the Portugueze. Nor is his di&s;po&s;ition or talents &s;uited to liberal conver&s;ation. To me he is di&s;|tant; to his family moro&s;e. How dif|ferent from Solomon Mendez, who&s;e hou&s;e was the abode of cheerfulne&s;s! I am impatient to begin my voyage, con|fident, that I &s;hall find more &s;ociety on the Atlantic than in this populous city. But let me not be ha&s;ty or unju&s;t. Per|haps his re&s;erve is the re&s;ult of con&s;titu|tion; or his affairs may be deranged; or his dome&s;tic felicity impaired. He has probably been rendered unhappy by a di&s;obedient child or a fal&s;e friend. In &s;hort, I am willing to a&s;&s;ign any rea&s;on for his &s;upercilious di&s;tance, rather than attribute it to a bad di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="020481_0055_0FAF12B0AD8A9D78">Ye&s;terday after dinner I had &s;ome conver&s;ation with a Rabbi, who is in ap|pearance le&s;s arrogant, than his brother at Gibraltar, but more ba&s;e and wicked. As a &s;pecimen of his conver&s;ation, I &s;hall relate a tale, which he told. "When God created Adam, &s;aid the Rabbi, he formed him &s;o high and large, that his head reached the heavens, and his &s;ides extended from the ea&s;t to the we&s;t. The angels, terrified at his appearance, im|plored the protection of the Creator who, to rid them of their fears, put his hand on the head of Adam and re|duced his &s;ize to one thou&s;and cubits; but, according to other Jewi&s;h doctors, to le&s;s. His fir&s;t wife was called Lileth, who, being formed of as good earth as him&s;elf, di&s;dained to &s;ubmit to his au|thority, and flying up into the air, refu|&s;ed to return to her hu&s;band, although entreated by ho&s;ts of angels." From this improbable fiction he inferred the extreme degeneracy of man, and the in|herent ob&s;tinacy of woman. At the conclu&s;ion of this legend, equally im|probable and ab&s;urd, I&s;aac nodded a&s;|&s;ent;
<PB N="58" REF="020481_0056_0FAF12B16DEB2080">
but his family di&s;covered evident marks of di&s;&s;atisfaction. I wanted no further proof of the ba&s;ene&s;s of this &s;anctified villain, who aimed at in|gratiating him&s;elf with his patron by de&s;troying his peace of mind. The cau&s;e of his di&s;content was now evident. A dome&s;tic traitor imbittered his life, and e&s;tabli&s;hed in his bo&s;om that wor&s;t of in|qui&s;itions, a di&s;tru&s;t of his own family.</P>
<P>I &s;hall certainly di&s;clo&s;e my &s;enti|ments to d'Aco&s;ta on this head before my departure; my con&s;cience otherwi&s;e will not be at re&s;t.</P>
<P>As my &s;tay will be &s;hort, I &s;hall not have it in my power to give thee an ade|quate idea of this city, which I am told, is as well built, as it was before the earth|quake. Portugal is not my object. Her weakne&s;s is too well known at Algiers to create apprehen&s;ions. Ignorance, &s;loth and barbari&s;m characteri&s;e her &s;ons, and her daughters are the victims of pride and &s;uper&s;tition. Her &s;treets &s;warm with monks, and her convents
<PB N="59" REF="020481_0057_0FAF12B23A8F5928">
are crouded with nuns. Too eager in the pur&s;uit of commerce, &s;he neglected agriculture and manufactures. Her gold, which enriches others, is dro&s;s to her, and the precious &s;tones of the Brazils can &s;carcely procure bread for her chil|dren. Yet this country was not always contemptible. Her people were once indu&s;trious, and her prie&s;ts were learned. She could boa&s;t a Camoens and a Gama, and was governed by an Emanuel and a Braganza; who&s;e names are at this day le&s;s known in Portugal, than in any other part of Europe. Surely this na|tion was ordained to accumulate wealth to reward the indu&s;try of the Engli&s;h and the valour of the Algerines!</P>
<P>A philo&s;ophical hi&s;tory of commerce, would be an invaluable pre&s;ent to man|kind. But if ever it &s;hould appear, I will venture to predict, that its princi|ples will be but little attended to. The ambition of princes and the avarice of merchants will never be re&s;trained or re|gulated by &s;y&s;tems. The cu&s;tom-hou&s;e books alone will be read by the former.
<PB N="60" REF="020481_0058_0FAF12B32EA9D0E8">
If the imports have been productive, no|thing further will be required. The merchant, in &s;umming up his accounts, will be perfectly content, if there be a con&s;iberable balance in his favour; but experience evinces, that Britain has derived more &s;olid wealth from the tin mines of Cornwall, than Spain from the &s;ilver mines of Mexico; and the nutmegs of Borneo, have been more beneficial to Holland, than the diamonds of Brazil to Portugal.</P>

An ex|ten&s;ive coa&s;t, abounding in harbours; an immen&s;e tract of country, divided into thirteen &s;tates, but united, with re&s;pect to national exertion, under one head; a &s;oil, capable of producing all the ne|ce&s;&s;aries, and mo&s;t of the luxuries of life, the greater part of which is &s;till covered with the noble&s;t timber, and abounds in the mo&s;t u&s;eful mines, the inexhau&s;tible materials of future navies; towns ri&s;ing into cities, and cities already a&s;piring to be the emporiums of commerce; the in|habitants free, active and intelligent; their governments mild and enlightened; religion promoted by a benevolent tole|ration, and morality enforced by the brighte&s;t examples; the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings have been founded throughout Europe, as eminently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the new &s;tates.

tho&s;e illu&s;trious &s;pies, was undoubtedly the hurry of bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>I have delivered my letters of intro|duction to the gentlemen to whom they are addre&s;&s;ed. The&s;e letters de&s;cribe me as a French gentleman, who wi&s;hes to &s;ee the country before he engages in either commerce or agriculture. Some hints are given of a dome&s;tic misfortune, which has rendered his own country di&s;agree|able to him. I decline dining abroad, but in the afternoon occa&s;ionally vi&s;it a few families. As it is known that I came la&s;t from Li&s;bon, no French letters could be expected from me. I am yet at an inn, which is crouded with foreigners, but &s;hall remove &s;hortly to lodgings in a private family, which admits but one &s;tranger. The few Frenchmen whom I have &s;een, finding me di&s;tant, are deter|mined to be equally &s;o. Their pride in this particular is far from being di&s;agree|able to me.</P>

<P>You cannot as yet expect any thing particular from me. In general I am plea&s;ed with the appearance of the peo|ple. Their deportment is gentle and un|a&s;&s;uming, and my ears have not as yet been offended with many oaths.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erve a particular cla&s;s of men, their hair loo&s;e and unpowdered, their hats uncocked, their linen without ruffles, and their coats, which are generally light coloured, with mohair buttons. Can the&s;e be the officers and &s;oldiers of the late ar|my, who, having parted with their mili|tary dre&s;s, &s;till affect an uniformity in ap|parel?

<P>I was called to this employment &s;o &s;ud|denly, that I had not time to read many
<PB N="70" REF="020481_0068_0FAF12BB9DFA9B38">

We had often heard of Peru and Mexico through the medium of Spain; but a Penn&s;ylvanian was le&s;s known to us, than a Greenlander or a Chine&s;e. They &s;hall however have no rea&s;on in future to complain of our ne|glect. Due attention &s;hall be paid by us to their national en&s;igns on the ocean; nor &s;hall their government or re&s;ources continue unnoticed.

Se|veral nations have complimented them with &s;plendid emba&s;&s;ies. Aver&s;e to mag|nificence and o&s;tentation I live among them without ceremony, and &s;hall not flatter their pride or excite their avarice by promi&s;es of commercial treaties never intended to be performed. If my em|ployment was known, it is probable that I &s;hould be condemned to die by their tribunals, unle&s;s torn in pieces by the po|pulace.

another of green leaves for Adam. But the father of mankind, with becoming dignity, rejected the pre&s;ent, till, per|&s;uaded by Eve, he con&s;ented to wear it to &s;creen him, as he &s;aid, from the too powerful rays of the &s;un. After this &s;uc|ce&s;s the influence of fa&s;hion extended to their &s;ons and daughters. Her inventi|on grew more lively and her exertions more varied. In the&s;e days, it is record|ed, &s;he was attended by &s;implicity, a nymph who&s;e cheeks vied in fre&s;hne&s;s with the blu&s;hes of the morn, and who&s;e limbs, frequently exerci&s;ed in the cha&s;e, excelled in &s;ymmetry and &s;trength.

In &s;hort, no form of republican government can long oppre&s;s a brave and enlightened people.

<P>In Penn&s;ylvania enthu&s;ia&s;m is frequent|ly found; but the influence of &s;uper&s;titi|on is trifling. I have lately heard the rhap&s;ody of a female preacher. I figure to my&s;elf thy extreme &s;urpri&s;e on this occa&s;ion. Yes, Fatima, a female preach|er, in a garb, long, white and flowing, her head uncovered, her hair in natural ringlets, her countenance by turns ex|pre&s;&s;ive of pity and anger, of joy and terror, proclaimed to an attentive audi|ence the coming of Chri&s;t. Yet &s;he is not &s;uppo&s;ed to be mad. Although wo|men are forbidden by one of the fir&s;t Na|zarene teachers to &s;peak in their church|es, or to appear in them with their heads uncovered, yet this woman, in violation of both the&s;e precepts, dared to appear in the manner I have de&s;cribed.

<P>THE attention paid to the body of a decea&s;ed friend in this city is decent and amiable; but the manner to a &s;tranger mu&s;t appear particular and ludicrous.</P>
<P>A man is employed to announce the death of a citizen. For this purpo&s;e he raps at all the doors, and in a loud and &s;olemn tone of voice invites the family to the funeral. I went ye&s;terday to pur|cha&s;e a pair of gloves at a &s;hop, the mi&s;|tre&s;s of which is pregnant. Whil&s;t I was bu&s;ied in trying them on, a trumpet|er of death, thru&s;ting his funereal face into the &s;hop, pronounced the doleful invitation in &s;hrill and tremulous ac|cents.

<P>In one of my late walks, I perceived a number of the&s;e men, whom in a for|mer letter I conjectured to be the offi|cers of the late army, entering the door of a large building. Finding that they were followed by &s;everal not dre&s;&s;ed in uniforms, I took the liberty of entering with them. I perceived a great number of them &s;eated on benches, placed at equal di&s;tances with great exactne&s;s. I &s;ate down among&s;t them, prepared, if que&s;tioned, to have told them, with the greate&s;t politene&s;s, that I was a French gentleman on my travels, and would be extremely happy in being honoured with their acquaintance; but not one of them took the lea&s;t notice of me or of each other. Their ladies, who &s;eemed al&s;o to wear uniforms, were &s;eated &s;eparate from the men. An awful &s;ilence pre|vailed, which I had hitherto imagined was not numbered among&s;t chri&s;tian virtues, e&s;pecially when ladies are pre&s;ent. At
<PB N="93" REF="020481_0091_0FAF12CFF9E768F8">
length, the men began occa&s;ionally to groan, and the women to &s;igh. An air of &s;erious &s;orrow was diffu&s;ed over all their faces, which (with &s;hame I confe&s;s it) affected me with horror. Not a word was uttered; but the &s;ighs and groans were repeated with &s;carce any in|termi&s;&s;ion. Surely, thought I, this is a &s;cene of inchantment. For what pur|po&s;e are the&s;e people a&s;&s;embled? mirth cannot be their object; for they are all &s;erious, and &s;ome even &s;orrowful; nor can mercantile bu&s;ine&s;s be tran&s;acted in &s;uch profound &s;ilence. Have they com|mitted exce&s;&s;es during the war, which they publicly meet to expiate? This cannot be the ca&s;e; for their humanity was as con&s;picuous as their valour; be|&s;ides, with what cruelties can their wives and daughters be charged, who &s;eem equally &s;orrowful and penitent? A thought now prevailed in my mind, which I am a&s;hamed to confe&s;s even to thee.

The young man withdrew his foot &s;omewhat ha&s;tily and looked as if he felt pain; but continued as &s;ilent as before. He is compo&s;ed of fle&s;h and blood, thought I with much &s;atisfaction, and doubtle&s;s their females, many of whom were pret|ty, are equally &s;o.</P>
<P>At length I concluded, that they were a&s;&s;embled to &s;ee and hear one of tho&s;e exhibitions (I think they are cal|led tragedies) with which the Nazarenes are extremely delighted, becau&s;e they make them weep; but that the per|formers had di&s;appointed them.</P>

<P>The con&s;titution of this congre&s;s, which a&s;&s;i&s;ted by patrioti&s;m, was found adequate to the exigences of war, is di&s;|covered to be defective in peace; like a &s;hip, which having re&s;i&s;ted the fury of the &s;torm, is endangered by the hollow &s;well during a calm.</P>
<P>A Convention con&s;i&s;ting of members from all the &s;tates, is expected to meet in this city for the purpo&s;e of revi&s;ing the confederation. It is expected, that their re&s;olves will &s;ilence all di&s;putes by

<P>General Wa&s;hington, who has done as much as any hero, and a great deal more than mo&s;t, who have been flatter|ed with that title, re&s;ides, as a private gentleman, on his e&s;tate in Virginia. Tho&s;e who are honoured with his con|ver&s;ation, are delighted with his affability, vivacity and &s;olid &s;en&s;e. In the field he has manife&s;ted the qualities of the general and the hero; at his abode he di&s;plays the accompli&s;hments of the gentleman, and the virtues of the hu&s;band and friend. But the mo&s;t arduous ta&s;k remains; the talents of the legi&s;lator are now expect|ed from him.</P>
<P>During the heat of the war the con|federation was formed by the noble&s;t efforts of patrioti&s;m and wi&s;dom. But patrioti&s;m was &s;ometimes more active

than judicious; and wi&s;dom often &s;aw defects, which &s;he could not remedy.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of Rhode I&s;land, the lea&s;t con&s;iderable in the union, has hitherto defeated the be&s;t commercial plans. She has refu&s;ed to &s;end members to this con|vention, and by this conduct will defeat unanimity, and countenance defection and revolt.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;ett's Bay is now convul&s;ed by the de&s;peration of factious individuals; but the wi&s;er part of the community happens to con&s;titute a majority.

<P>Ever attentive to the welfare and glory of my country, I have revolved in my mind the means of rendering this very probable revolt beneficial to Algiers, and glorious to the Sublime Porte, by e&s;tabli&s;hing an Ottoman Malta on the coa&s;ts of America. An European Bon|neval was received, honoured and pro|moted by the mini&s;ters of the Porte. Is not an American Shays entitled to equal rewards, if capable of rendering equal &s;ervices? Should this idea merit your approbation, I will immediately (but with due caution) commence a negociation with Shays, the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts in&s;urgents, and the refractory leaders of the revolt in Rhode-I&s;land. They will without doubt ex|pect a large &s;um of money, in which, I think,
<PB N="105" REF="020481_0103_0FAF12DB5805B820">
they ought to be gratified. But the gold, for greater &s;ecurity, mu&s;t be conveyed to their ports by a very re&s;pectable fleet, and pre&s;ented to their leaders by a Ba|&s;haw of Three Tails at the head of about one hundred thou&s;and &s;pahis and janiza|ries.

<P>THE republican form of government is extremely flattering to the pride of man. Orators, poets and philo&s;ophers, have &s;ounded its prai&s;es, whil&s;t the civi|lized part of the world has li&s;tened with rapture. Who is not &s;oothed by the &s;plendid dreams of Plato and Rou&s;&s;eau? Who is not rou&s;ed by the thunder of De|mo&s;thenes and Cicero?</P>
<P>But in all matters, which involve the welfare of nations, fancy &s;hould be re|&s;trained and judgment alone con&s;ulted.</P>
<P>In every form of government the peo|ple are undeniably the &s;ource of authori|ty. The throne of the greate&s;t de&s;pot, as well as the tribunal of the humble&s;t magi&s;trate, is founded on the con&s;ent of the governed. I may be told, that de&s;|poti&s;m
<PB N="108" REF="020481_0106_0FAF12DD1482ABE0">
is generally e&s;tabli&s;hed and always maintained by <HI>force.</HI> But can the per|&s;onal force of one man controul and &s;ub|due a nation? Alas! the depravity of thou&s;ands mu&s;t co-operate with the ambi|tion of their leader, and the power of the &s;upreme tyrant is &s;upported by inferior tyrants for the gratification of their own pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>I have often lamented the &s;ituation of our Deys. No &s;ooner is one murdered, than another is elected by the murderers of his predece&s;&s;or. Should he dare to decline this honour, his refu&s;al is follow|ed by in&s;tant death. To pre&s;erve his own life, he is obliged to act the tyrant, and reluctantly con&s;ents to murders, which the brutal &s;oldiers demand and execute with rapture. The authority of the Dey is founded on the &s;oldiery&mdash;and &s;urely the &s;oldiers are men.</P>
<P>Has not Con&s;tantinople her&s;elf often beheld an emperor triumphant in the morning and a headle&s;s trunk at night, whil&s;t his trembling &s;ucce&s;&s;or is compel|led
<PB N="109" REF="020481_0107_0FAF12DF09EBA470">
by the janizaries to accept the &s;em|blance of authority, as a &s;anction for their rapine and cruelty? Let no man call him a monarch, who is every hour expo&s;ed to the &s;abre of a popular janizary. The &s;hrine of the &s;aint may be gazed on; but the offerings are the property of the prie&s;ts. But I may be told, that the&s;e are the exce&s;&s;es of a ferocious &s;oldiery.&mdash; Are not the&s;e &s;oldiers men?</P>
<P>Let us now vi&s;it Ru&s;&s;ia, the mo&s;t ex|ten&s;ive monarchy in Europe. A woman, without any natural right, has been rai&s;|ed to the throne of that country by the &s;oldiery, who by this &s;ingle act govern the monarchy and the monarch. She takes care to &s;upply them with pay and plunder, and they continue to re&s;pect the work of their own hands. Here one part of the people (all could not be pre|&s;ent at the election) cho&s;e a &s;overeign for the whole, and for fa&s;hion &s;ake are content to be called &s;ubjects. Therefore the authority of this autocratix is derived from the people.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="020481_0108_0FAF12E05C875840">The French monarchy &s;hews great attention to the nobility and &s;oldiery; and for very good rea&s;ons. The &s;oldiery and nobility &s;upport the crown; and are not nobles and &s;oldiers men? If not, what are they?</P>
<P>The la&s;t monarchy I &s;hall mention is Sweden. The illu&s;trious monarch of this country, the worthy nephew of the immortal Frederick (and he too derived his authority from the people, who were con&s;tantly repre&s;ented by two or three hundred thou&s;and delegates, elected with great caution and fully in&s;tructed in the principles of government) this king of the Goths&punc; I &s;ay, re&s;enting that one part of his people &s;hould be oppre&s;&s;ed by an|other, formed a wi&s;e re&s;olution, that there &s;hould be no longer any complaints on that head. A&s;&s;embling therefore both parties, he by the advice of proper coun|&s;ellors, cho&s;en from the body of the peo|ple, brought the contending parties to rea&s;on. The rights of both nobles and people were placed in his hands, and he &s;eems determined to keep them as pled|ges
<PB N="111" REF="020481_0109_0FAF12E1B8998468">
of their affection. Surely all mu&s;t confe&s;s that his authority al&s;o is derived from the people.</P>
<P>It can be proved, I think, (without citing any more examples) that all human authority and power are derived from the the people; becau&s;e, I apprehend, that, if there was no people, there could be no human authority or power.</P>
<P>What minion of de&s;poti&s;m, after &s;eri|ou&s;ly peru&s;ing the&s;e arguments and ex|amples, will deny, that authority pro|ceeds from the people? Or what enthu|&s;ia&s;tic demagogue, who is capable of con|viction, will in&s;i&s;t, that dominion not on|ly proceeds from, but is inherent in, the people? The fir&s;t ought to reflect, that there can be no &s;tream without a &s;ource; and the &s;econd mu&s;t be convinced by ob|&s;ervation, that rivers invariably &s;eek the ocean.

<P>Their con&s;titutions, formed by a great majority of the people, inculcate as much liberty as men in &s;ociety can enjoy.

The phantom of foreign commerce, no longer pur&s;ued with inor|dinate avidity, mu&s;t &s;oon yield to the &s;o|lid efforts of dome&s;tic indu&s;try, guided by the wi&s;dom of the philo&s;opher and pa|triot. If this encouragement is given and the&s;e &s;y&s;tems e&s;tabli&s;hed, the Ameri|can republics will no longer be tributary to European indu&s;try, and the &s;peculati|ons of our Algerine &s;tate&s;men will be found altogether ideal and illu&s;ive.</P>
<P>I expect with impatience permi&s;&s;ion from the regency to return, which I beg you will &s;olicit with all the ardour of friend&s;hip. My dome&s;tic concerns may require my immediate pre&s;ence, and claim all my attention, e&s;pecially as in this &s;ta|tion I can render no e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice to my country.

<HEAD>LETTER XXIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>ALVAREZ TO SOLYMAN.</SALUTE>
<DATELINE>MALAGA.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>BEING informed by Maria, former|ly Fatima, who, having received bapti&s;m according to the rites of the church, has con&s;ented to be my wife, that you are authori&s;ed by Mehemet to &s;uperintend his bu&s;ine&s;s during his ab&s;ence, I think it rea&s;onable, in order to relieve you from &s;u&s;pence, to inform you, that we arrived in this port, after a very &s;hort pa&s;&s;age, in perfect health. As I am un|der no obligation to Mehemet, no apo|logy for my conduct is due to him. His behaviour to me, I confe&s;s (due allow|ance being made for education and ex|ample) was humane and liberal. The money therefore, which he gave as the price of my freedom, &s;hall be re&s;tored to him &s;peedily and with intere&s;t. As he has frequently acknowledged my indu&s;try and fidelity, he will then be in my debt.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="020481_0122_0FAF12EF910481A0">He will probably &s;ay, that I have rob|bed him of Maria; but as he &s;hall have no ju&s;t rea&s;on to complain of me with re|&s;pect to any part of his property, her va|lue al&s;o, according to the current price of beauty at Algiers, &s;hall be paid to him. As for her affections, he may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that he never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them. She endured his company, becau&s;e &s;he was his &s;lave, and her mildne&s;s of tem|per prevented her from expre&s;&s;ing di&s;|content.</P>
<P>Let it not be &s;aid, that I made u&s;e of unju&s;tifiable methods in gaining her heart. As long as their child was living, I con|&s;idered her as united to Mehemet by that tie. I pitied her &s;ituation and e&s;teemed her for her gentlene&s;s and di&s;cretion. But on the death of the child, pity pro|duced affection and e&s;teem ripened into love. My eyes and behaviour at fir&s;t te&s;tified my &s;entiments. She &s;aw, and did not di&s;approve. At length I ventur|ed to di&s;clo&s;e my pa&s;&s;ion. She li&s;tened, and con&s;ented. A virtuous affection re|moved her natural timidity. Our love
<PB N="125" REF="020481_0123_0FAF12F0E78F1EF8">
was mutual and ardent; the coa&s;t of Spain not di&s;tant. We ventured and &s;ucceeded; but by what methods mu&s;t remain a &s;ecret. Convinced by my ar|guments, &s;he is now a chri&s;tian and my wife. The liberality of &s;ome merchants &s;upplied us with decent clothing, and their patronage will afford me the means of &s;upporting a family by indu&s;try.</P>
<P>When you write to Mehemet, you may acquaint him that I retain a due &s;en&s;e of his mildne&s;s and forbearance. Not to be &s;evere is meritorious, in a country where &s;lavery is e&s;tabli&s;hed. I am no longer his &s;lave, and am therefore capable of be|ing his friend. As for Maria, &s;he does not &s;peak of him with di&s;re&s;pect. She is a chri&s;tian and forgives him.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MEHEMET TO SOLOMON MENDEZ.</SALUTE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA.</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>RUINED, did&s;t thou &s;ay?&mdash;No; I am pre&s;erved. I am free and delight in the freedom of others, and am no longer either a &s;lave or a tyrant. At once a chri&s;tian and a Penn&s;ylvanian, I am dou|bly an advocate for the rights of man|kind.</P>
<P>On the receipt of this packet, in&s;tantly di&s;patch the inclo&s;ed letters to the young couple. The letter to Alvarez contains a deed, which gives to him and his wife an immediate right to the half of my pro|perty, and to the remainder at my death. Supply them with a thou&s;and dollars, in order to free them from debts, if they have contracted any, and to enable them to repair to Philadelphia. If that &s;um be not &s;ufficient, &s;upply them with more. Convinced from a perfect knowledge of
<PB N="127" REF="020481_0125_0FAF12F3F5AEA918">
the fluctuation of our councils, that the charge I undertook, expo&s;ed me to more danger in Algiers than America, I brought with me a greater &s;um than even thou wert aware of; a part of which, &s;ince the account of my ruin, as thou calle&s;t my deliverance, I have laid out in the pur|cha&s;e of two exten&s;ive farms; on one of which I &s;hall re&s;ide my&s;elf; the other is the property of Alvarez and his wife. Him I &s;hall regard as my friend and Ma|ria &s;hall be unto me as a daughter.</P>
<P>In&s;ult not my under&s;tanding by be|&s;towing the name of genero&s;ity on this conduct. If I can be ju&s;t to this ill treated pair, my mind will be at ea&s;e, nor can I in this in&s;tance, lay claim, to the merit of philo&s;ophy. At &s;ixty the tumult of the pa&s;&s;ions ought to &s;ub&s;ide, without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from philo&s;ophic re&s;ignation.</P>
<P>Yet I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that, on the receipt of thy la&s;t letter, I was greatly &s;hock|ed. A fever en&s;ued, attended with a delirium. My extreme temperance alone
<PB N="128" REF="020481_0126_0FAF12F462E6D850">
pre&s;erved my life. At length the fever abated; I am re&s;tored to health and peace, and am even a&s;toni&s;hed, that my mind &s;hould have been &s;o long the &s;eat of unworthy pa&s;&s;ions. Was my love the re&s;ult of rea&s;on? by no means; I have therefore di&s;carded it. Was my ambition founded on ju&s;tice? Alas! treachery and virtue are incompatible. How am I afflicted, when I recollect, that, in all po&s;&s;ible ca&s;es, the laws of the country, which I meant to betray, would have protected me from in&s;ult and injury. An open enemy may chal|lenge e&s;teem; a &s;py is a mean and de|te&s;table character. I have written to Solyman at Algiers, concerning a &s;um of money belonging to me, which is in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. He will remit that &s;um to thee on my account, which will re|main in thy hands, till the arrival of Maria and her hu&s;band in Philadelphia. When my family (they are all that Me|hemet can now lay claim to) &s;hall ar|rive, I &s;hall clo&s;e my affairs in Africa and Europe, and e&s;tabli&s;h my future tran|quillity

on the pillars of freedom, ju&s;tice, friend&s;hip and religion.</P>
<P>Algiers! thou, who ha&s;t often beheld me, animated by glory, or incited by ava|rice, preparing to encounter the raging tempe&s;t and the furious battle; who ha&s;t often welcomed thy returning &s;on, adorn|ed with trophies and loaded with &s;poils; who ha&s;t often &s;een him encouraging the ardour of youth and &s;oothing the woes of age; honoured for his valour, and &s;carcely envied for his magnificence. Al|giers, thou witne&s;s of my glory and di&s;|grace, farewel! And thou Penn&s;ylvania, who ha&s;t promi&s;ed to &s;uccour and protect the unhappy, that fly to thee for refuge, open thy arms to receive Mehemet the Algerine, who, formerly a mahometan, and thy foe, has renounced his enmity, his country and his religion, and hopes, protected by thy laws, to enjoy, in the evening of his days, the united ble&s;&s;ings of FREEDOM and CHRISTIANITY.</P>
