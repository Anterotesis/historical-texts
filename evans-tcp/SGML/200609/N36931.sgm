<HEAD>Barlow's Letter. From the CONNECTICUT COURANT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Messrs.</HI> HUDSON &amp; GOODWIN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE inclo&s;ed pamphlet was printed at <HI>Matthew Ly<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">'s</HI> p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s; in Fairhaven. He entitles it "Copy of a Letter from an <HI>Ameri|can Diplomatic</HI> Character in France to a member of Congre&s;s in Philadelphia." Some of the mo&s;t offen&s;ive parts of this letter were recited in the indictment of Lyon, the pub|li&s;hing of which (i. e. the reading the whole letter to large collections of people in a great many towers in his di&s;trict, drawn together for the purpo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e) was the &s;ubject of the <HI>se|cond</HI> count, and the "printing" it of the <HI>third</HI> count in the indictment.&mdash;[The &s;ub|ject of the <HI>first</HI> count was a letter from Lyon to Mr. Spooner, the printer of the Wind&s;or paper.]</P>
<P>Lyon told the court that the fir&s;t knowledge he had of it was hearing general <HI>Mason,</HI> a &s;enator from Virginia, read it to a number of gentlemen in Philadelphia la&s;t &s;ummer; that he applied to Mr. <HI>Baldwin,</HI> to whom it was addre&s;&s;ed, for liberty to take a copy it, to which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e con&s;ented, upon condition that Lyon &s;hould &s;hew it to his friends in Ver|mont, particularly governor Robin&s;on and general Bradley, but not to &s;uffer any co|pies of it to be taken, nor to have it printed, to which Lyon &s;aid he &s;olemnly agreed.&mdash; How he came to <HI>print</HI> it in fact, however, in violation of his "&s;olemn agreement," he did not inform the court.</P>
<P>Several gentlemen who have &s;een it, and who are acquainted with Mr. Barlow, have expre&s;&s;ed their decided opinions that he never wrote it. The public may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, how|ever, that the thing, infamous as it is, was really written by <HI>Joel Barlow,</HI> and &s;ent by the hand of a Mr. <HI>Lee</HI> to <HI>Abraham Baldwin.</HI> The mo&s;t indi&s;putable te&s;timony of the fact can be laid before the public if nece&s;&s;ary.&mdash; Tho&s;e who recollect what Mr. Barlow <HI>once was</HI>&mdash;tho&s;e who <HI>once</HI> re&s;pected and loved him for his amiable di&s;po&s;itions, his talents, and his &s;uppo&s;ed pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty, will exclaim "O! how fallen!" They will di&s;cover new evi|dence, if po&s;&s;ible, of the accur&s;ed demoralizing powers of that modern French philo&s;ophy which has made of Europe a charnel hou&s;e, and which Mr Barlow has been long known to have embraced with enthu&s;ia&s;tic ardor. But who could have expected from <HI>him</HI> &s;uch di&s;plays of hatred to his native country!&mdash; Who could expect that Joel Barlow would have become the &s;landerer of WASHINGTON and ADAMS!

It is true that the manner in which it was thru&s;t down the throats of the people of America, by the man who&s;e mon|&s;trous influence formed an inexplicable con|tra&s;t with the weakne&s;s of his political tal|ent, has effectually humbled u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur own eyes, and has taught our citizens to pride them&s;elves in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">enunciation of national dig|nity; it is likewi&s;e true, that as the treaty affected France, it was a &s;erious and undi&s;|gui&s;ed attack upon her intere&s;ts; it was gi|ving the lie to all our profe&s;&s;ions of friend|&s;hip and &s;ympathy with her, in he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> di&s;tre&s;&s;|ed &s;ituation, it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rrowing the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">reedom of commerce, multiplying the ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">les of contraband, and throwing every a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vantage of &s;olving the frightful problem of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">pre&s;en|tative democracy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> that problem as already <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lved by us; our ener|gy was prai&s;ed, our wi&s;dom ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gerated, our example quoted by them on all occa&s;ions.

But it often happens, in public as well as in private affairs, that the greate&s;t injuries are forgiven or excu&s;ed, while &s;lighter ones, &s;uch as border on contempt, excite the mo&s;t ungovernable re&s;entment, and lead to the greate&s;t acts of vengeance; a &s;triking example of this has fallen under my ob&s;ervation in the conduct of the&s;e two re|publics: at the moment when the old gov|ernment of France was &s;haken to its founda|tion, the new government of the United States was con&s;olidated and was beginning its operations under the mo&s;t favorable au&s;|pices. A great revolution in America had completed its work, it convinced the world of the &s;olidity of its principles, and held up to view an unexampled pro&s;pect of public happine&s;s. A much greater revolution in France was opening its career. Its authors and conductors, though frightened at the imm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;ity of the undertaking, from the ta&s;k of our admini&s;tration, and his election was known to be unanimous; the French theer+fore &s;aw in WASHINGTON, the people of the United States; they counted on his friend|&s;hip, they drew con&s;olation from his &s;uppo&s;|ed &s;ympathy, while their principles were ca|lumniated and the nation threatened with war by all the cabinets of Europe. They grew &s;trong from a &s;en&s;e of danger, and they were proud of the reproaches of prin|ces, becau&s;e they were confident of the ap|probation of the American people, the elder &s;ons of liberty.</P>
<P>It is difficult for you to conceive to what a degree their &s;en&s;ibility was carried on this &s;ubject, at the beginning of the revolution; it was clear that a &s;en&s;ibility of &s;uch force, mu&s;t be the foundation of the mo&s;t extrava|gant affection; if properly nouri&s;hed, it would have beg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t a con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">idenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> without bou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ds; if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, or an&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">d with indif|ference, it mu&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> jealou&s;y, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> by the rule<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of ju&s;tice, and blind to the light of truth.

This opinion may be ha&s;tily formed, but they were confirmed in it by the Pre&s;ident's na|ming to the &s;ame place, <HI>Govern<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ur Morris,</HI> who for two winters pa&s;t, had filled Paris with invectives again&s;t every principle of li|berty, who was previou&s;ly dete&s;ted by all the leaders of the revolution; who was known to be the broker, protector, and corre&s;pon|dent of the mo&s;t obnoxious emigrants. It is po&s;&s;ible, that <HI>Washington,</HI> in &s;uffering <HI>Jef|ferson</HI> to return, might have acted from o|ther motives than tho&s;e of enmity to the French revolution, though no other motives appear; but his naming <HI>Morris,</HI> was an in|&s;ult that admits of no palliative; it is in vain to &s;ay he was ignorant of the character that this man bore in Paris: he was a wide-mouth bawle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, and had been for two years the exaggerating echo of all the abu&s;e in all Burke's pamphlets, and the wor&s;t papers in London.</P>
<P>This &s;eene was continued here, to the a|&s;toni&s;hment of all Europe for three years, his bu&s;ine&s;s was to mi&s;lead the Pre&s;ident, with re&s;pect to what was going on in France, to in&s;ult the French nation and as far as po&s;&s;i|ble to betray them, for it was univer&s;ally be|lieved, and I have no doubt of the fact, that after the Engli&s;h and Au&s;trian amba&s;&s;adors retired from Paris, <HI>Morris</HI> acted as &s;ecret a|gent and &s;py for tho&s;e two cabinets. A ha&s;|ty word or action co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing from an amba&s;&s;a|dor, though malicious in it&s;elf, is not always interpreted to be the language of the govern|ment that &s;ent him; but a &s;eries of o&s;tenta|tious abu&s;e continued for three years, be|comes unequivocal. All Europe leagued a|gain&s;t liberty, con&s;idered America already in the coalition; and France would at that time have grouped you among her enemies, had it not been for &s;everal circum&s;tance, wholly adventitious or foreign to the conduct of your cabinet.</P>
<P N="1">1. Some Americans in Paris, of character far more re&s;pectable than that of <HI>Morris,</HI> endeavored, and with a momentary &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce&s;s, to convince the leaders here, that his con|duct when known in America, mu&s;t be di&s;|approved.</P>
<P N="2">2. France was in want of the trade and provi&s;ions of the United States, both for her colonies and her&s;elf, it would therefore be inconvenient at that time to have them for enemies.</P>
<P N="3">3. The conduct of <HI>C. Genet,</HI> a &s;ubject of &s;o much triumph to your cabinet and that of St. James's, was one of the cau&s;es that &s;aved you from a war at that time. Genet had been &s;ent by Bri&s;&s;ot; Bri&s;&s;ot was now fallen, it was for this rea&s;on that the con|duct of Genet was di&s;approved, and that of the American government pa&s;&s;ed over in &s;i|lence, though a &s;ilence marked with re&s;ent|ment and contempt.</P>
<P>When after every remon&s;trance, and a formal demand from this government your executive was plea&s;ed to remove Morris from his o&s;ten&s;ible &s;ituation in Paris, he e|migrated, that is, he went and joined the e|migrants in Germany, and has been ever &s;ince among the enemies of France. But this is not all, a letter from Wa&s;hington to Morris,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>We have never before heard of any such letter, and believe none such ever exi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ted; it is unquestionably</HI> one <HI>of the million of ja|cobinic lies invented with design to make our beloved WASHINGTON odious to his country|men.</HI></NOTE> dated in the latter end of the year 1795, intercepted, and now in the hands of the directory, gives him a commi&s;&s;ion as a &s;ecret agent to the cabinet of London, to tran&s;act bu&s;ine&s;s &s;o apparently ho&s;tile to the intere&s;t of France, that I am a&s;&s;ured this let|ter has &s;harpened the edge of re&s;entment here, more than the whole of Jay's treaty. This and other circum&s;tances have given full credit to the opinion here, that a journey which Morris took from London to Berlin, in the year 1796, was a mi&s;&s;ion on the part of the Briti&s;h government to engage the king of Pru&s;&s;ia to rejoin the coalition again&s;t France. Another fact, though of le&s;s con|&s;equence, could not e&s;cape the animadver&s;i|on of the French government. John Pari&s;h, American con&s;ul at Hamburg, was employ|ed by the Engli&s;h government as their agent for tran&s;mitting the &s;ub&s;idies and loans, to the Emperor, and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, for the war again&s;t France; and to freight and fit out ve&s;&s;els for the tran&s;porting troops to the We&s;t-Indies. It may be &s;aid that the American government were not an&s;werable for a thing of this &s;ort, of which they could have no knowledge; but this has not pre|vented the fact from being recognized among the proofs of an unfriendly di&s;po&s;ition on your &s;ide, and certainly great allowances ought to be made for the jealou&s;y of a na|tion g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ded by all Europe, tormented by her own traitors, and &s;tanding alone, in a cau&s;e in which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he expected, at lea&s;t a friendly countenance from us, if not an active &s;up|port. She looked upon the cau&s;e of liberty as our cau&s;e; and though &s;he did not require us to take arms, &s;he con&s;idered her&s;elf as fighting our battles in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r own.</P>
<P>Much has be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n &s;aid on the &s;ubject of na|tional gratitude, and to a&s;certain how much, or whether any was due from us to France, for the part &s;he took in the American war. I will not add to the ob&s;ervations that have been made on this head, but it is clearly my opinion, that &s;he has rendered us more &s;olid &s;ervice by e&s;tabli&s;hing the principle of repre|&s;entative government in Europe, than by aiding us in America.</P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;ay very little on the mi&s;&s;ion of Monroe, becau&s;e I take it for granted, from what I have heard, that he has already told his own &s;tory in print. I will only &s;ay that in the mid&s;t of all difficulties created by the madne&s;s of his predece&s;&s;or, the continued fol|ly of your Executive, the unfortunate con|clu&s;ion and ratification of the Engli&s;h treaty, he conducted him&s;elf in &s;uch a manner as to form by his &s;ingle character a counterpoi&s;e to all the weight of re&s;entment from this go|vernment; nobody doubts here, but that he would have continued to do &s;o to the end of the war, if your cabinet had let him alone, and confined their blunders to their own continent, What mu&s;t then have been the a&s;toni&s;hment of all our friends, and the ex|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ltation of the court of London, to &s;ee him recalled in the mo&s;t abrupt and cen&s;orious manner.</P>

The candidates were Adams and Jeffer&s;on; the one a re|puted Royali&s;t, and enemy to France; the other an eminent Republican, and a friend to the cau&s;e of liberty in all countries.

<P>When the election of Adams was announ|ced here, it produced the order of the 2d of March, which was meant to be little &s;hort of a declaration of war; but it was &s;o far &s;hort of it as to leave room on your &s;ide to come forward with an additional project of nego|ciation, if you wi&s;hed to avoid that calam|ity.</P>
<P>The enmity of the old Pre&s;ident towards France, was now con&s;idered as nationalized in America, and the government here was determined to fleece you of your property, to a &s;ufficient degree to bring you to your feel|ing in the only nerve in which it was pre&s;um|ed your &s;en&s;ibility lay, which was your pecu|niary intere&s;t.</P>
<P>This uncomplying di&s;po&s;ition of the Di|rectory induced Mr. Adams to call an extra|ordinary meeting of Congre&s;s, and con&s;e|quently to make a &s;peech.</P>
<P>To a man who had the lea&s;t preten&s;ions to prudence, there were but two cour&s;es to be taken; one was to declare war if he wi&s;hed to ruin his country; the other was, if he wi&s;hed to &s;ave it, to offer to negociate by &s;end|ing &s;ome man or men that he knew would be agreeable to France; or, at lea&s;t, not to play the bully, by forcing a man back, who had ju&s;t been driven out of Paris. The true policy would have been, to retrieve the mi&s;|take of Wa&s;hington, by &s;ending back Mon|roe. You cannot imagine the effect produc|ed here by the name only of a known friend to liberty in America. A report prevailed here for a few days, that Madi&s;on was nam|ed to this mi&s;&s;ion;&mdash;it almo&s;t di&s;armed the government of all re&s;entment. Had the the news proved true, and Madi&s;on arrived, the bu&s;ine&s;s would have been &s;ettled in 24 hours.</P>
<P>But Adams to attain his object, whatever it might be, found out a third cour&s;e, which di&s;covers more invention than I &s;uppo&s;ed him to po&s;&s;e&s;s: he formed a commi&s;&s;ion of three to make the people of the United States believe that a negociation was offered on their part, and then filled it up with names from which there could not be the lea&s;t ex|pectation of &s;ucce&s;s. The fir&s;t was a man who had ju&s;t been refu&s;ed, and could not be offered again without an in&s;ult: &s;ending him back, was undoubtedly intended as an in&s;ult, and it was &s;o received: the &s;econd was a man who&s;e effigy had been burnt in Virgi|nia, for his violent defence of the Briti&s;h treaty&mdash;at lea&s;t it was &s;o reported and be|lieved here: the third was a little <HI>make-weight</HI> man, appointed with the intention that he &s;hould have no influence:&mdash;and yet, to prove to you the facility of this govern|ment, after all that had pa&s;&s;ed, I am able to a&s;&s;ure you, from the be&s;t authority, that if Gerry had been &s;ent alone, and not &s;hackled with the other two, the directory would have negociated with him, without any difficulty; at pre&s;ent, the three have been here five months, without being received or rejected; and a new law is made, by which an additi|onal number of neutral ve&s;&s;els will fall into the hands of the French.</P>
<P>I &s;hall hardly gain credit with you were I to &s;tate on how &s;mall a pivot the fate of na|tions turns in Paris at this moment.</P>
<P>The &s;peech of John Adams, at the open|ing of Congre&s;s in November, was waited for here with as much expectation as if peace or war depended upon it. It was hoped that after he had &s;ent his commi&s;&s;ioners, he would at lea&s;t avoid the u&s;e of in&s;ulting lan|guage again&s;t the nation with whom he was pretending to treat. But when we found him borrowing the language of Edmund Burke, and telling the world that, although he &s;hould &s;ucceed in treating with the French, there was no dependence to be placed on any of their engagements; that their re|ligion and morality were at an end; that they had turned pirates and plunderers, and it would be nece&s;&s;ary to be perpetually armed again&s;t them, though you were at peace&mdash; we wondered that the an&s;wer of both hou&s;es had not been an order to &s;end him to a mad|hou&s;e. In&s;tead of this, the Senate have echoed the &s;peech with more &s;erv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lity than ever George the third experienced from either hou&s;e of Parliament. Read over the para|graph that &s;peaks of France; his bringing in of the word Europe, under pretence of generalizing it, is &s;o flim&s;y a cover for his attack on thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> nation, that it only adds to the abu&s;e, by attempting to impo&s;e on the under&s;tanding; he certainly could not mean the Engli&s;h, for he brags in the next para|graph how well they keep their treaty. He could certainly mean nobody but the French, for no other nation have overturned religion. Had this &s;peech borne a friendly a&s;pect, or had the paragraph in que&s;tion been &s;imilar to the one in&s;erted in the &s;peech of governor M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fflin, on the &s;ame &s;ubject, it would have facilitated the negociation, and probably &s;aved millions to the United States.</P>
<P>In enumerating the cau&s;es which have brought the two republics to the brink of war, &s;everal memorable &s;peeches in your hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, mu&s;t not be forgot|ten. One of your orators calls the French government a <HI>five headed monster</HI>&mdash;another &s;ays, Barras, when he pronounced his farewell &s;peech to Monroe, mu&s;t have been drunk or mad. The&s;e gentlemen forget that Barras reads their &s;peeches; and that the five head|ed mon&s;ter, when it &s;hall have devoured the fry of Europe, may po&s;&s;ibly &s;hark them in their turn.</P>
<P>Another &s;ubject of complaint, and that not the lea&s;t, is the &s;currility of many of your new&s;papers, again&s;t the republic: among the mo&s;t abu&s;ive i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the GAZETTE OF THE UNITED STATES, which is con&s;idered here as an official paper, or printed under the eye and pa|tronage of the government. The office of foreign affairs receives the&s;e papers regularly; and you cannot &s;uppo&s;e that any of the&s;e in|&s;ults pa&s;s unnoticed. It is remarked here, and with great truth, that there is more dir|ty calumny again&s;t the French in American than in the London papers.</P>
<P>But it is in vain to amu&s;e our&s;elves in de|&s;cribing the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e, unle&s;s there be a remedy within our reach. In my opi|nion there is one, but I have &s;carcely any hope that you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> wi&s;e men will &s;tumble upon it. Acknowledge your error in &s;ending Pinckney and Mar&s;hall to this country;&mdash; recall them, and perhaps Gerry with them&mdash; name and &s;end Madi&s;on or Monroe to take their place, and let the Pre&s;ident in his me&s;|&s;age to the Senate acknowledging the nomi|nation, utter &s;entiments full of friend&s;hip to the French nation, government, and cau&s;e&mdash; let him acknowledge that the principles of liberty are equally dear to the two countries &mdash;and deprecate the idea of gratifying the tyrants of the world, by exhibiting the two great republics, who&s;e exi&s;tence they &s;trove in vain to prevent, now tearing out each others vitals.</P>
<P>I perceive that much &s;tre&s;s is laid by your Pre&s;ident, and your other leaders, on the conduct of this Government, in refu&s;ing to receive your amba&s;&s;ador Pinckney. I wi&s;h tho&s;e gentlem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n could &s;ome how or other be made acquainted with the following hi&s;tory. I hope you will not &s;uppo&s;e, by in&s;erting it here, my intention is to ju&s;tify the French government: No, my object will be truly to &s;erve my country, and to vindicate the ho|honor of all the ardent &s;pirits among you, if they &s;hould neglect this opportunity of going to war for the three broken wheels of Gen. Pinckney's carriage.</P>
<P>In the year 1796, the Swedi&s;h amba&s;&s;ador here, the Baron de Stahl, obtained leave of ab&s;ence, and pre&s;ented his &s;ecretary as charge d'affaires, who had the king's commi&s;&s;ion for that purpo&s;e. This man was refu&s;ed, on which de Stahl pre&s;ented a note to the mini|&s;ter of foreign relations, de&s;iring him to a&s;|&s;ign the rea&s;ons, that the king might know in what he had offended the republic, &s;ince he had been the fir&s;t in Europe to acknow|ledge it, and the mo&s;t ardent to de&s;erve its friend&s;hip. The an&s;wer to this note was, an order to the new charge d'affaires to quit the republic, and a recall of the French am|ba&s;&s;ador from Stockholm. As &s;oon as cou|riers could pa&s;s to Sweden and back, the mat|ter was accommodated, by the King's re|newing the Baron de Stahl, who was agreea|ble to the French.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time the Amba&s;&s;ador of Tu&s;cany, while in peaceable exerci&s;e of his functions, was ordered by the government to quit Paris in 24 hours, and the republic in 8 days, without any rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned. He obeyed, and the Grand Duke very com|plai&s;antly &s;ent another.</P>
<P>The amba&s;&s;adors of Portugal and Rome, who were in full credence and activity a few weeks ago, are now in pri&s;on in Paris. It is true that this was in con&s;equence of a rup|ture between this government and each of theirs. But the fate of agents in &s;uch ca&s;es, u&s;ed to be, to be &s;ent away, and not to be impri&s;oned.</P>
<P>The king of Spain lately &s;ent a new amba&s;|&s;ador here, in great pomp, who is refu&s;ed, and ordered to quit the country, without rea&s;ons publicly a&s;&s;igned.</P>
<P>You will remark, that in this light the Spani&s;h and Swedi&s;h are ca&s;es in point, for your Pinckney. But their poor Kings had not learned the etiquette of John Adams, to name and &s;end back the &s;ame man who had been refu&s;ed. Kings, at this day, have no notion of a rupture with France.</P>
<P>Another event has lately happened to the Baron de Stahl, which makes the Swedi&s;h ca&s;e, taken altogether, different from the A|merican. (God grant that the American may never come to it, as long as you have loving couples to &s;end on the&s;e mi&s;&s;ions.) The wife of Baron Stahl is ju&s;t &s;ent out of the republic on a &s;u&s;pi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion of con&s;piracy; while the hu&s;band occupies his po&s;t. What would the Columbian blood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay to this? Let <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> hear none of your wicked bachelors remark, that this order was &s;olicited by the hu&s;band; no &s;uch rea&s;on is a&s;&s;igned. In|deed, had the Baron obtained the order, he ought to have obtained leave to clamor a|gain&s;t it afterwards; decency &s;eemed to re|quire it, and yet he has not done it. Had it been an American amba&s;&s;ador, and had the American been me, I &s;hould have tried hard to get my ca&s;e in&s;erted in a &s;peech of John Adams, or a letter of Timothy Pickering. I repeat to you, that I am not undertaking the hopele&s;s and u&s;ele&s;s ta&s;k of vindicating all the mea&s;ures that the violent convul&s;ions of the revolution have induced this people to adopt. But when Mr. Adams &s;hall hear of the &s;ending away of his amba&s;&s;ador, I would advi&s;e him, and all tho&s;e who are concerned in his wounded honor, to club that commo|dity with the kings, princes, and &s;tates a|bove mentioned, and to try to bear their part with a patience becoming a government that ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> merited this &s;ort of cha&s;ti&s;ement more than all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eir fellow &s;ufferers put together.</P>
<P>Your three commi&s;&s;ioners will doubtle&s;s &s;eize this occa&s;ion, by Mr. Lee, to forward their di&s;patches. The&s;e will probably be of a nature to induce the Pre&s;ident to take &s;ome deci&s;ive &s;tep; and I am in trembling expec|tation of &s;eeing him give another de&s;perate leap into the regions of madne&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. Without knowing preci&s;ely the face that the commi&s;|&s;ioners will put to the bu&s;ine&s;s, I will ven|ture to affirm, that the <HI>answer propre</HI> will contribute more than its due &s;hare to the coloring. A manly and independent &s;tyle of writing appears not to belong to their char|acter.</P>
<P>Were I to write their letters to the exec|utive, it &s;hould be in language like this. &mdash;"The French have many rea&s;ons for be|ing offended with the American government; the&s;e rea&s;ons are exaggerated by their jea|lou&s;y, and other other &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions in&s;e|parable from the revolution. This is an un|favorable moment, and we are improper per|&s;ons, to attempt to explain away the imagi|nary wrongs on which a great part of the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> re&s;entment is founded. We advi&s;e you to recall us three, and at the &s;ame time to re|place us with one or more per&s;ons who&s;e cha|racters are well known and approved by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he French; &s;uch as Madi&s;on or Monroe. If you wi&s;h to terminate the&s;e di&s;putes by ne|gociation, you mu&s;t be prepared for con&s;id|erable &s;acrifice; &s;uch as a loan of money &s;imilar to what this nation m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">de to you la&s;t war; &s;uch as a modification of the Bri|ti&s;h treaty, or at lea&s;t a new treaty with France, giving her more advantages than that treaty gives to England. It is po&s;&s;ible that on conditions of this kind, you may ob|tain &s;ome indemnification for the &s;poilations on your commerce; &s;omewhat in the man|ner provided for with the Engli&s;h in Mr. Jay's treaty.</P>
<P>"It is &s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary for us to ob&s;erve that your commi&s;&s;ion, con&s;idering the di&s;|tance between the two countries, mu&s;t no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be &s;traitened in its powers, as in this affair &s;o much depends on the <HI>manne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> The Pre&s;i|dent will excu&s;e us if we in&s;i&s;t on the nece&s;&s;i|ty of u&s;ing the utmo&s;t precaution in his pub|lic &s;peeches relative to this country and of the revolution, the magnanimity of the na|tion, the &s;acrifices they have made in the ge|neral cau&s;e of liberty; the French are ex|tremely &s;en&s;ible on this &s;ubject."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>And if they had suffered you to write in that style, or had written to themselves, they would have dec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ved and received the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> American.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>I do not know that a letter of this kind would produce any effect with you; but I beg you to remember the warning I now give you, that if your executive is inacce&s;&s;able to &s;entiments like the&s;e, you are very &s;oon at war with the conquerors of Europe.</P>
<P>So much depends on the mea&s;ures to be taken in con&s;equence of the di&s;patches which I &s;uppo&s;e will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">company this letter, that I could not re&s;t ea&s;y without communicating my &s;entiments to &s;ome one who would be likely to make a good u&s;e of them. I was going to addre&s;s them to Jeffer&s;on, or to &mdash;, but I thought they would be &s;afe&s;t and be&s;t in the hands of my olde&s;t and be&s;t friend.</P>
<P>You will naturally conclude, that &s;ome credit is due to my opinions, when you re|flect that they have been formed on a clo&s;e ob&s;ervation of every &s;tage of the revolution, and an intimate relation with every &s;et of leaders. The pre&s;ent directory are but the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors and &s;ub-&s;ucce&s;&s;ors of my fellow-la|borers in the days of my activity; for the political generations have pa&s;&s;ed away with &s;uch rapidity, that in every thing, but wi&s;|dom, I am one of the wor&s;t or be&s;t of the pre&s;ent race.</P>
<P>From the manner in which your pre&s;ent commi&s;&s;ion was compo&s;ed, there is very lit|tle doubt in my mind, and there certainly is none in the minds of the Directory, that the emb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;y was really intended for Lewis the XVIIIth. Your Executive did not fore&s;ee the 18th Fructidor. When, in God's name are we to expect any ju&s;t ideas from Ameri|ca, relative to France? Look for a Repub|lic in England, but do not, I be&s;eech you, look for a Monarchy in France!</P>
