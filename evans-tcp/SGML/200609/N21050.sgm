<HEAD>NEW SONG, Sung by Mr. Darby, jun. in the Pantomimical Dance, called The Sailor's Landlady. WORDS BY MRS. ROWSON. MUSIC BY MR. REINAGLE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>HOW ble&s;t the life a &s;ailor leads,</L>
<L>From clime to clime &s;till ranging,</L>
<L>For as the calm the &s;torm &s;ucceeds,</L>
<L>The &s;cene delights by changing.</L>
<L>When tempe&s;ts howl along the main,</L>
<L>Some object will remind us,</L>
<L>And cheer, with hopes to meet again,</L>
<L>The friends we left behind us.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>CHORUS.</HEAD>
<L>For, under &s;nug &s;ail, we laugh at the gale;</L>
<L>And, tho' land&s;men look pale, never heed 'em;</L>
<L>But to&s;s off the gla&s;s, to a favourite la&s;s,</L>
<L>To America, commerce, and freedom.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And when arriv'd in &s;ight of land,</L>
<L>Or &s;afe in port rejoicing,</L>
<L>Our &s;hip we moor, our &s;ails we hand,</L>
<L>Whil&s;t out the boat is hoi&s;ting.</L>
<L>With chearful hearts the &s;hore we reach;</L>
<L>Our friends, delighted, greet us;</L>
<L>And tripping lightly o'er the beach,</L>
<L>The pretty la&s;&s;es meet us.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>CHORUS.</HEAD>
<L>When the full flowing bowl enlivens the &s;oul,</L>
<L>To foot it we merrily lead 'em;</L>
<L>And each bonny la&s;s will drink off her gla&s;s,</L>
<L>To America, commerce, and freedom.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our prizes &s;old, the chink we &s;hare,</L>
<L>And gladly we receive it;</L>
<L>And when we meet a brother tar</L>
<L>That wants, we freely give it:</L>
<L>No free-born &s;ailor yet had &s;tore,</L>
<L>But chearfully would lend it:</L>
<L>And when 'tis gone, to &s;ea for more;</L>
<L>We earn it, but to &s;pend it.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>CHORUS.</HEAD>
<L>Then drink round, my boys; 'tis the fir&s;t of our joys</L>
<L>To relieve the di&s;tre&s;s'd, clothe, and feed 'em;</L>
<L>'Tis a duty we &s;hare, with the brave and the fair,</L>
<L>In this land of commerce and freedom.</L>
