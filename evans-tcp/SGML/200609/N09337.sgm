<HEAD>AN ESSAY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>NO &s;ubject can be more important in it&s;elf, or better &s;uited to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, and the exerci&s;es of this day, than the U&s;e and Advantages of the fine Arts, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e of Polite Lite|rature. The&s;e &s;tudies are perhaps too much under|valued by the public, and neglected by the youth in our &s;eminaries of &s;cience. They are con&s;idered as meer matters of trifling amu&s;ement, and de&s;pised in compari&s;on with the more &s;olid branches of Learning.</P>
<P>The knowlege of Languages, Mathematics, Me|taphy&s;ics and Philo&s;ophy, undoubtedly de&s;erves to engage the attention of the greate&s;t Genius. For &s;kill in the&s;e &s;ciences, the World (while the world remains) will revere the memory of a Bacon, a Newton, and a Locke. But when they are carried beyond a certain point; when they are of no advan|tage to the common purpo&s;es of life; when they are employed upon que&s;tions which human Rea&s;on can never with certainty determine, they degene|rate into meer &s;peculations of amu&s;ement, and be|come no farther valuable, than as they &s;erve to en|large the mind, clear the under&s;tanding, and enter|tain us in the hours of lei&s;ure from the important avocations of bu&s;ine&s;s. The Geometrical labours

for the Quadrature of the Circle, the Metaphy&s;ical controver&s;ies about the Exi&s;tence of matter, and the E&s;&s;ence of Spirit, though a field for the di&s;|play of genius, in what are they more intere&s;ting to mankind, than the contentions of Antiquaries a|bout the genuinene&s;s of a medal, or the di&s;putes of Commentators about the various readings of their antient manu&s;cripts?</P>
<P>Let us con&s;ider the advantages which ari&s;e to the world from the &s;tudy of the liberal Arts.</P>
<P>Mankind in the pre&s;ent state, are extremely lia|ble to be led away by mean and &s;ordid vices, to be attached to the low enjoyments of &s;en&s;e, and thus degraded almo&s;t to a level with the brutal creation. As that uncea&s;ing thir&s;t for happine&s;s, which is the univer&s;al &s;pring of action, mu&s;t have &s;ome object for its gratification; the Divine Being, to rai&s;e us above these low desires, hath implanted in our minds a taste for more pure and intellectual plea|sures. The&s;e plea&s;ures have their &s;ource in the fine Arts, and are more e&s;pecially found in the elegant entertainments of polite Literature. They ennoble the &s;oul, purify the pa&s;&s;ions, and give the thoughts a better turn. They add dignity to our &s;entiments, delicacy and refinement to our manners. They &s;et us above our meaner pur&s;uits, and make us &s;corn tho&s;e low enjoyments, which perhaps we once e&s;teemed as the perfection of human felicity. I ap|peal to all per&s;ons of judgment, whether they can ri&s;e from reading a fine Poem, viewing any ma&s;ter|ly work of Genius, or hearing an harmonious con|cert 
<PB N="5" REF="011901_0004_0F87428973044998">
of Mu&s;ic, without feeling an openne&s;s of heart, and an elevation of mind, without being more &s;en|sible of the dignity of human nature, and de&s;pi&s;ing whatever tends to deba&s;e and degrade it?</P>
<P>The&s;e are the delights, which humanize the &s;oul, and poli&s;h away that rugged ferocity of manners, which is natural to the uncultivated nations of the world.</P>
<P>In every land, in every age, at the time when the unconquered &s;pirit of freedom, joined with that laudable ambition, which fires the &s;oul to heroic deeds; hath rai&s;ed the nation to the highe&s;t pitch of glory, the fine Arts have been &s;tudiou&s;ly cultivated, and have &s;hined forth with peculiar lu&s;|tre. For Learning and Glory walk hand in hand through the world. A &s;avage people, before the dawn of literature, may indeed be terrible in arms: but being &s;tained with the blood of cruelty, tarni&s;h|ed with that wild barbarity, which degrades cou|rage into brutality, they never attain to the &s;ummit of renown; and either &s;ink unnoticed into oblivi|on, or leave to po&s;terity a name more infamous for barbari&s;m, than famed for heroic atchievements. While every voice celebrates the bravery of an Alexander, a Scipio, a Cae&s;ar, and a Marlbo|rough; who remembers the &s;avage fiercene&s;s of the lion-hearted Richard; or what mouth is opened in the prai&s;e of that &s;courge of A&s;ia, the per&s;ian Nadir?</P>
<P>The &s;ame ardour of ambition, the &s;ame greatne&s;s
<PB N="6" REF="011901_0005_0F87428A30094978">
of thought, which in&s;pires the Warrior to brave dan|ger in the conquering field, when diffu&s;ed among a people will call forth Genius in every &s;tation of life, fire the imagination of the Arti&s;t, and rai&s;e to &s;ublimity the a&s;piring Mu&s;e.</P>
<P>Look into the annals of antiquity. View the Gre|cians at the aera of learning and politene&s;s, when the fine Arts were carried to their highe&s;t glory, when the whole nation were encouragers of &s;cience, and every per&s;on a judge of literature; when by great|ne&s;s of genius, correctne&s;s of ta&s;te and refinement of manners, they rendered them&s;elves famous throughout the world, and patterns of imitation to all po&s;terity. Then was the time that Greece pro|duced tho&s;e Heroes that astonished Europe and Asia with the &s;ound of their victories; then was the time that Athens, Sparta and Thebes gave laws to the world. And could a Nation fail of ri&s;ing to the high|e&s;t pitch of fame, when animated with the thunder|ing eloquence of Demo&s;thenes and Pericles, fired to warlike deeds by the martial mu&s;e of Homer, and warmed with tho&s;e noble &s;entiments which in|&s;pire the productions of Ae&s;chylus, Euripides and Sophocles?</P>
<P>The glory of Arts and Arms &s;unk in Greece and ro&s;e again with renewed lu&s;tre in He&s;peria. Rome di&s;tingui&s;hed her&s;elf for literature, even from the fir&s;t dawn of her greatne&s;s. In her early days, while her unpoli&s;hed manners bore too near a re&s;emblance to the rough virtues of Sparta, &s;he could boa&s;t an Ennius, the boldne&s;s of who&s;e thoughts even Virgil
<PB N="7" REF="011901_0006_0F87428AE846A370">
him&s;elf did not di&s;dain to imitate. Then flouri&s;hed Accius, Naevius, Pacuvius, tho&s;e &s;amed dramatic poets, with the bold and &s;pirited Lucilius, the fa|ther of the Roman &s;atire. But the&s;e writers have &s;unk into the dark grave of oblivion, and left be|hind only &s;ome &s;mall traces of their &s;ame. Then appeared the rough genius of Plautus, the milder elegance of Terence, and the &s;oft mu&s;e of Catullus: Then the poli&s;hed Lucretius, &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed for all the graces of poetic expre&s;&s;ion, that Virgil evi|dently borrowed from his writings, his &s;tyle, ver&s;i|fication and manner of de&s;cription. In the mean time Eloquence ro&s;e to the highe&s;t perfection at Rome. Be Cicero a witne&s;s, who&s;e prai&s;e is unne|ce&s;&s;ary, whether as an orator, a patriot, or a phi|lo&s;opher.</P>
<P>But &s;ee Rome attains to the &s;ummit of greatne&s;s. The world &s;ubmits to her &s;way. Satiated with the &s;poils of victory, &s;he &s;its unmole&s;ted on the throne, and diffu&s;es the mild ble&s;&s;ings of peace. Then flou|ri&s;h the names deare&s;t to &s;ame, the glories of the Augu&s;tan age: The maje&s;tic Mu&s;e of Virgil, the &s;econd who dared to attempt the dignity of epic &s;ong; the poli&s;hed elegance of Horace, graced with the &s;ounding lyre, and armed with the keen &s;word of &s;atire; the &s;trong and &s;portive imagination of Ovid; the &s;oft elegiac &s;trains of Tibullus and Propertius; and the hi&s;toric grandeur of Livy. The world is con&s;cious of their fame. Their cha|racters need not to be illu&s;trated by the tedious im|pertinence of prai&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="011901_0007_0F87428BA5C3C150">
The Glory of Rome faded by a gradual decay. The Mu&s;e &s;till &s;hone, though with tarni&s;hed lu&s;tre, in the tragedies of Seneca, the &s;atires of Juvenal and Per&s;ius, and the heroic poems of Lucan, Statius, Claudian, and Silius Italicus. Hi&s;tory produced the nervous, the manly Tacitus; and Philo&s;ophy could &s;till &s;how her Seneca and Pliny. Till at length Ty|ranny u&s;urped the dominion, and Barbari&s;m over|&s;pread the land of Italy.</P>
<P>For a nearer in&s;tance of the trophies of the liberal Arts, let us view the &s;tate of Ru&s;&s;ia in the la&s;t cen|tury. In a cold unpoli&s;hed land, deep-&s;unk in the &s;hades of &s;avage ignorance, a Monarch ri&s;es, who moved with compa&s;&s;ion for his &s;ubjects, fired with love of glory, and endowed with a &s;oul &s;uperior to the age, forms a project of civilizing his country. He &s;ails to other lands, imports the rudiments of the arts, and affords both by precept and example the utmo&s;t encouragement to genius. The Nation rai&s;es her&s;elf from the du&s;t, repels her enemies, ex|tends her borders, leads forth her conquering ar|mies, and now threatens the total &s;ubver&s;ion of the Ottoman empire.</P>
<P>Britain alone can claim the glory of an equality with Greece and Rome. There for two centuries the Arts have flouri&s;hed with almo&s;t unabated lu&s;|tre: And the &s;lighte&s;t reflection will inform us that this period is by far the mo&s;t celebrated in the Bri|ti&s;h hi&s;tory. In the glorious reign of Elizabeth, there aro&s;e a Spen&s;er, unequalled in all the plea&s;ing charms of luxuriant de&s;cription; who&s;e fancy tran&s;|ports
<PB N="9" REF="011901_0008_0F87428C6766F5B8">
us to fairy land, and brings us acquainted with a &s;hadowy race, the beings of his own creation. Then a Shake&s;pear, the matchle&s;s genius of the drama; endowed with the mo&s;t noble extravagance of imagination, the &s;tronge&s;t powers of humour, the &s;overeign command of the pa&s;&s;ions, and the keene&s;t in&s;pection into all the mazes of the human &s;oul. To the&s;e succeeded the unbridled wit of Cowley, the &s;oft graces of Waller, and the various grandeur of all-accompli&s;hed Dryden. Then with the united charms of every Mu&s;e, appeared the immortal Milton; who with the greate&s;t force of natural genius, a&s;&s;isted by all the aids of art, and by the noble de&s;criptions of the ins&s;ired writers, hath produced a Poem, almo&s;t as much &s;uperior to Homer's, in &s;ublimity of conception, as it is in the greatne&s;s of its &s;ubject:
<Q><L>A Genius univer&s;al as his theme,</L>
<L>A&s;tonishing as Chaos, as the bloom</L>
<L>Of blowing Eden fair, as Heav'n &s;ublime.</L>
<BIBL><HI>Thom&s;on</HI></BIBL></Q></P>
<P>After a &s;hort eclip&s;e in the luxurious reign of Charles II. the reviving Arts &s;hone forth with &s;u|perior brightne&s;s in the pro&s;perous days of William and Anne; while the victorious Marlborough bore Britain's thunder on her foes, and made Europe tremble at the &s;ound of his arms. Then flouri&s;hed the poli&s;hed mu&s;e of Addi&s;on, who revived in Eng|land the cla&s;&s;ic elegance of the Augu&s;tan age; who&s;e works, adorned with the highe&s;t &s;ublimity of &s;entiment, and the nice&s;t delicacy of thought,
<PB N="10" REF="011901_0009_0F87428D21A80B08">
filled with ea&s;y humour which points the ridicule at vice, (while they afford in&s;truction and entertainment of the noble&s;t kind to every reader,) may boa&s;t as their greate&s;t honour and di&s;tingui&s;hed excellence, that they are peculiarly calculated to plea&s;e and improve the faire&s;t part of the creation.</P>
<P>Then aro&s;e a Swift, the friend of virtue, the &s;courge of folly, and the terror of vice; unequalled for manly &s;en&s;e, liveline&s;s of fancy, the powers of wit and humour, and the &s;evere&s;t poignancy of &s;atire. Happy, had not his mind, &s;oured with di&s;|appoinment in the earlie&s;t views of his ambition, too often endeavoured by the gro&s;&s;e&s;t indelicacy of de&s;cription to deba&s;e the dignity of human nature; and indulged a &s;pirit of mi&s;anthropy, which clouds his be&s;t productions, and while we admire the force of his Genius, bids us dete&s;t the &s;entiments of his heart. What age &s;hall forget the undying fame of Pope! Whether in plea&s;ing &s;trains he paints the beauties of nature; mourns with the &s;ofte&s;t notes of elegiac ver&s;e; or with moral rapture unfolds all the principles and pa&s;&s;ions of the human &s;oul: Whether in &s;portive lays he di&s;plays the foibles of the gentler Sex; impales vice and dulne&s;s on the point of &s;atire; or holding, up the gla&s;s of tran&s;la|tion, reflects with unabated light the glories of the Maeonian &s;ong.</P>
<P>For the power of de&s;cribing the beauties of rural &s;cenes, and copying the different appearances of nature, what writer can vie with the plea&s;ing Thom|&s;on! The liveline&s;s of his paintings, his &s;ublime
<PB N="11" REF="011901_0010_0F87428E3411ECF0">
morality, and his delicacy of thought ju&s;tly rai&s;e him to the highe&s;t rank of genius.</P>
<P>Nor mu&s;t we forget the unaffected ea&s;e of Gay and Prior, the &s;pirited wit of Congreve, the delicate fancy of Parnelle, the dramatic powers of Otway, Southern and Rowe, the cervantic humour of Ar|buthnot, with the pointed &s;atire and &s;trong imagi|nation of Young. The&s;e writers will convey the Engli&s;h glory to the mo&s;t di&s;tant ages of po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Polite Letters at pre&s;ent are much on the decline in Britain; not through a &s;carcity of authors, or want of encouragement from the public; but by rea&s;on of that luxurious effeminacy, which hath cau&s;ed a decay of genius, and introduced a fal&s;e ta&s;te in writing. Their Men of learning are in|fected with pedantry. They are great admirers of antiquity and followers in the path of &s;ervile imi|tation. They &s;acrifice ea&s;e and elegance to the affectation of cla&s;&s;ic correctne&s;s, &s;etter the fancy with the rules of method, and damp all the ardour of a&s;piring invention. While the men of Genius (who are at pre&s;ent a di&s;tinct cla&s;s of writers) in contempt of the critic chains, throw off all ap|pearance of order and connection, &s;port in the wilde&s;t &s;allies of imagination, and adopt the greate&s;t extravagance of humour, which too often &s;inks to buffoonery, or is &s;oured with the malevolence of &s;atire.</P>
<P>America hath a fair pro&s;pect in a few centuries of ruling both in arts and arms. It is univer&s;ally 
<PB N="12" REF="011901_0011_0F87428E9AD87B78">
allowed that we very much excel in the force of natural genius. And although but few among us are able to devote their whole lives to &s;tudy, per|haps there is no nation, in which a larger portion of learning is diffu&s;ed through all ranks of people. For as we generally po&s;&s;e&s;s the middle &s;tation of life, neither &s;unk to va&s;&s;alage, nor rai&s;ed to inde|pendance, we avoid the &s;ordid ignorance of pea&s;ants, and the unthinking di&s;&s;ipation of the great. The heroic love of Liberty, the manly fortitude, the genero&s;ity of &s;entiment, for which we have been &s;o ju&s;tly celebrated, &s;eem to promi&s;e the future ad|vancement and e&s;tabli&s;hed duration of our glory. Many incidents unfortunate in them&s;elves, have tended to call forth and &s;u&s;tain the&s;e virtues. Hap|py, in this re&s;pect, have been our late &s;truggles for liberty! They have awakened the &s;pirit of freedom; they have rectified the manners of the times; they have made us acquainted with the rights of man|kind; recalled to our minds the glorious indepen|dance of former ages, fired us with the views of fame, and by filling our thoughts with contempt of the imported articles of luxury, have rai&s;ed an oppo&s;ition, not only to the illegal power, but to the effeminate manners of Britain. And I cannot but hope, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome dangerous examples of infamous defection, that there is a &s;pirit remaining in the&s;e Colonies, that will invariably oppo&s;e it&s;elf to the efforts of u&s;urpation and perfidy, and forbid that Avarice &s;hould ever betray us to Slavery.</P>
<P>This Land hath already begun to di&s;tingui&s;h it|&s;elf in literature. It is peculiarly famed for the
<PB N="13" REF="011901_0012_0F8742913496B908">
&s;tudy of Theology; and though too much infe&s;ted with the &s;hort-lived productions controver&s;y, can boa&s;t of &s;ome Divines, who however inelegant in &s;tyle and expre&s;&s;ion, have perhaps never been ex|celled in depth of thought and profoundne&s;s of rea&s;oning. Out late writers in the cau&s;e of liberty have gained the applau&s;e of Europe. Many elegant e&s;&s;ays have been produced in the &s;tyle of wit and humour; nor hath Poetry been entirely uncultiva|ted among us. The encouragement, which is given to the Arts and Sciences, affords a pro&s;pect of our future glory.</P>

<L>For ev'ry mu&s;e and ev'ry grace is theirs.</L>

<LG>
<L>"Nor &s;hall the&s;e &s;cenes our ri&s;ing fame confine;</L>
<L>With equal prai&s;e the Si&s;ter-arts &s;hall &s;hine."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"Behold &s;ome new Apelles, &s;kill'd to trace</L>
<L>The varied features of the lovely face;</L>
<L>Bid the gay land&s;cape ri&s;e in all its charms,</L>
<L>Or wake from du&s;t the &s;lumbring chief to arms;</L>
<L>Bid Art with Nature hold a plea&s;ing &s;trife,</L>
<L>And warm the pictur'd canvas into life."</L>

<L>"See heav'n-born Mu&s;ic &s;trike the trembling &s;tring;</L>
<L>Devotion ri&s;ing on the raptur'd wing."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>"See the gay Dome with lofty walls a&s;cend,</L>
<L>Wide gates unfold, &s;tupendous arches bend,</L>
<L>The &s;piry turrets pointing to the &s;kies,</L>
<L>And all the grandeur of the palace ri&s;e."</L>

<L>"Then the bold pow'rs of Eloquence &s;hall reign,</L>
<L>And bind the pa&s;&s;ions in their magic chain;</L>
<L>At Freedom's voice bid manly bo&s;oms glow,</L>
<L>Or prompt the tender tear at guiltle&s;s woe."</L>

<L>"Thus o'er the happy Land &s;hall Genius reign,</L>
<L>And fair Yalen&s;ia lead the noble train."</L>

<L>Oh! born to glory when the&s;e times prevail,</L>
<L>Great Nur&s;e of learning, ble&s;t Yalen&s;ia, hail!</L>
<L>Within thy walls, beneath thy plea&s;ing &s;hade,</L>
<L>We woo'd fair Science, that cele&s;tial maid.</L>
<L>Fate gives no more tho&s;e raptures to pur&s;ue,</L>
<L>Borne from thy &s;eats we bid a la&s;t adieu.</L>
<L>Long may&s;t thou reign of every joy po&s;&s;e&s;t,</L>
<L>Ble&s;t in thy teachers, in thy pupils ble&s;t,</L>
<L>To di&s;tant years thy fame immortal grow,</L>
<L>Thy &s;preading light to unborn ages flow:</L>
<L>Till Nature hear the great Archangle's call,</L>
<L>Till the la&s;t flames involve the &s;moaking ball;</L>
<L>Then thy fair Sons to happier climes a&s;cend,</L>
<L>Where Glory never fades, and Joys &s;hall never end.</L>
