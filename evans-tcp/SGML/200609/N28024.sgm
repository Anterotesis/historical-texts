<Q><BIBL>DEUTERONOMY, XXXIV. 10, 11, 12.</BIBL>
<P>And there aro&s;e not a prophet, &s;ince in I&s;rael, like un|to Mo&s;es, whom the Lord knew face to face;</P>
<P>In all the &s;igns and wonders, which the Lord &s;ent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his &s;ervants, and to all his land;</P>
<P>And in all that mighty hand, and in all that great terror, which Mo&s;es &s;hewed in the &s;ight of all I&s;rael.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TO prai&s;e &s;uch as have lately died, is the in|&s;tinctive conduct of &s;orrow. From tho&s;e who &s;ur|round the bed of a departed friend, the fir&s;t accents, which &s;ucceed the involuntary bur&s;t of angui&s;h, are enumerations of his real or &s;uppo&s;ed virtues. Even in the mouths of the intelligent, and in the chambers of the refined and delicate, the prai&s;e is warm and unqualified, and nature overleaps every bound, rai&s;|ed by artificial decorum. Among nations le&s;s en|lightened, open and &s;trong commendations of the dead are inwoven in the e&s;tabli&s;hed manners, and demanded by common decency; while, among &s;a|vages, funeral &s;ongs, replete with pa&s;&s;ionate &s;enti|ments, glowing imagery, and exce&s;&s;ive panegyric, are prominent features of national character, and &s;plendid parts of public celebration.</P>
<P>TO this general voice of nature Revelation has added its &s;upreme &s;anction. The text, which I have ju&s;t now read, is an eulogy of the highe&s;t kind.
<PB N="6" REF="037339_0005_100CD72A7834FA20">
When we remember the numbers, and the charac|ter, of the prophets who followed Mo&s;es; when we con&s;ider that of this number were Samuel, Da|vid, I&s;aiah, and Daniel; we cannot but feel, that it would have been difficult to a&s;cribe to him a more honorable character.</P>
<P>WHAT then has been the cau&s;e, that no efforts of the mind have been le&s;s approved, than funeral eulogies; and that an in&s;ipid panegyric is become proverbial phra&s;eology? Has it not been, on the one hand, that grief, and not rea&s;on, has given birth to the prai&s;e, and that grief alone can admit its truth, or feel its propriety? Has it not been, on the other hand, that the Eulogi&s;t has come, in form, to make the mo&s;t of his theme; to create a character which has not exi&s;ted, and to &s;upply worth which he does not find; to di&s;play his ingenuity, rather than the features of the decea&s;ed; and to gain applau&s;e for his own talents, rather than re&s;pect for the &s;ub|ject of his panegyric. For the&s;e or &s;ome other rea|&s;ons, few attempts of this nature have &s;ucceeded; and the effort to gain e&s;teem for the dead has ter|minated in producing contempt for the living.</P>
<P>BESIDE the difficulties, always attendant on attempts of this nature, the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion in|volves &s;ome, which are peculiar. The &s;ubject of eulogy at this time is &s;o &s;plendid, as to in|duce, and authorize, every man to demand all that can be &s;aid by the human genius, and to &s;tipu|late for its noble&s;t efforts only; &s;o near to the heart of an American, as to warrant an unqualified re|jection of what&s;oever falls beneath its expectations and its wi&s;hes; &s;o often and &s;o illu&s;triou&s;ly panegy|rized, both at home and abroad, as to have little chance for novelty, or &s;ucce&s;s. The very <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of Wa&s;hington has become an equivalent to the high|e&s;t human dignity and worth, and all additions to it
<PB N="7" REF="037339_0006_100CEAC8EB204880">
have long pa&s;&s;ed rather for the mere unburdening of an American heart, than for the means of honour|ing his character. Where &s;o much is demanded, and &s;o little will be accepted, temerity only can fur|ni&s;h confidence to the &s;peaker, and per&s;uade him, that he &s;hall &s;atisfy the wi&s;hes of his fellow citizens.</P>
<P>TO &s;ome per&s;on, however, the ta&s;k, a&s;&s;igned to me, mu&s;t have fallen; and to none could it have fallen without anxiety. I have ventured upon it, with an intention to perform a duty, not with a hope to fulfil expectation. Funeral panegyric I have always &s;hunned; and would more willingly have avoided it on this occa&s;ion, than on any other.</P>
<P>THIS apology, which may probably &s;eem long, and u&s;ele&s;s, will, it is hoped, neverthele&s;s prove of &s;ome u&s;e to the &s;peaker. It is hoped, that it will, in &s;ome degree, ju&s;tify the undertaking, and explain and vindicate the manner in which it will be execu|ted; that it will lead my audience to expect, and &s;hew the rea&s;ons why I &s;hall exhibit, a plain and cha&s;tized account of my &s;ubject; and that it will in|duce them to con&s;ider what I &s;hall a&s;&s;ert, however it may differ from their opinions and feelings, as be|lieved and felt by me.</P>
<P>HUMAN greatne&s;s is of many kinds, and appears under many forms; but the diver&s;ities of per&s;onal greatne&s;s have their foundation in the intellect, and in the heart. How far this is, in either ca&s;e, the re&s;ult of the original &s;tructure of the mind, and how far of effort and acqui&s;ition, it is probably impo&s;&s;ible for man to determine. We &s;ee &s;ome actually great; but the cau&s;e, and the means, have in a degree been, hitherto, in a &s;tate of uncertainty.</P>
<P>IN all ca&s;es, in which this di&s;tinction has been atchieved, whether intellectual, or moral, there mu&s;t
<PB N="8" REF="037339_0007_100CEACAAD8073E8">
to &s;uperior endowments and attainments, be &s;uper|added, by Providence, a happy field, in which they may be advantageou&s;ly di&s;played. Some object &s;een, and felt, by the mind, to be of &s;ufficient im|portance to ju&s;tify high and ardent efforts, and to repay the labours, and the &s;ufferings, which attend them, mu&s;t be pre&s;ented to the under&s;tanding, and lay hold on the heart. In this &s;ituation, if ever, the man ri&s;es above him&s;elf, feels his powers in a new manner, exerts talents of which he was before uncon&s;cious, and virtues which had hitherto been dormant. Him&s;elf, as well as the world, is a&s;ton|i&s;hed at what he is, and at what he does; the fi&s;h|erman is changed into an Apo&s;tle; the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mahommed.</NOTE> trader of Mecca becomes the founder of a religion, and an empire, embracing a fourth of mankind; and the <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Nadir Kouli Khan.</NOTE>leader of a gang of thieves a&s;cends the throne of Per&s;ia, and places beneath his feet the &s;cepter of Hindo&s;tan.</P>
<P>AMONG tho&s;e occa&s;ions, which have lifted man above his ordinary &s;phere, none have di&s;played with more &s;plendor, either talents, or virtues, than the revolutions of religion and empire. The conque&s;t of nations, and the &s;ubver&s;ion of governments, form|ed, as well as exhibited, Nebuchadnezzar, Cyrus, Alexander, Hannibal, Cae&s;ar, Ghengis, Timur-bec, Kouli Khan, Frederic, 2d. Hyder Al<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">, and various others of a &s;imilar character. To all the&s;e the pride of victory, the exten&s;ion of conque&s;t, and the increa&s;e of dominion, ro&s;e in full view; and, with a fa&s;ci|nation wholly irre&s;i&s;tible, prompted them to con|trive, to dare, and to attempt, beyond the limits of ordinary belief. When we contemplate the&s;e men, however, our admiration is always mingled with di&s;gu&s;t; and the few things in their characters, which claim e&s;teem, are lo&s;t in the multitude of tho&s;e,
<PB N="9" REF="037339_0008_100CEACCAF453240">
which force abhorrence. The lu&s;tre &s;hed around them is gloomy and di&s;mal; a glare of Avernus; a "darkne&s;s vi&s;ible;" at which the eye gazes with a mixture of a&s;toni&s;hment and horror. We &s;icken, while we read their exploits; and blu&s;h, that &s;uch &s;courges of the world &s;hould have claimed a com|mon nature with our&s;elves.</P>
<P>BUT there have been happier occa&s;ions for call|ing into action, and into light, the &s;uperiour facul|ties of man. Empire and religion have, at times, changed for the better. Men have ari&s;en, whom the world has not only admired, but revered, and loved; to whom applau&s;e was not the mere outcry of a&s;toni&s;hment, but the &s;ilent and &s;teady te&s;timony of the under&s;tanding, the cheerful and in&s;tinctive tribute of the heart. When oppre&s;&s;ion was to be re&s;i&s;ted, government to be reformed, or the moral &s;tate of mankind to be renewed, the Ruler of the Univer&s;e has always &s;upplied the means, and the a|gents. Where to the human eye the whole face of things has worn an uniform level; where every fa|mily was lo&s;t in in&s;ignificance, and every citizen was a pea&s;ant, and a &s;lave; energy, a&s;leep under the pre&s;&s;ure of weary circum&s;tances, and talents, veiled by humble and hopele&s;s ob&s;curity, have been rou&s;ed into action, and pu&s;hed forward to di&s;tincti|on and glory.</P>
<P>AMONG the men, who, at &s;uch periods, have ri&s;en to eminence, the Prophet, who is the &s;ub|ject of my text, is unque&s;tionably the fir&s;t. In all the talents which enlarge the human mind and all the virtues which ennoble the human heart, in the amiablene&s;s of private life and the dignity of a ru|ler, in dangers hazarded and difficulties overcome, in &s;plendor of de&s;tination and the enjoyment, and proofs, of divine complacency, he is clearly with|out a rival. Companions, perhaps &s;uperiors, he
<PB N="10" REF="037339_0009_100CEACF09F03468">
may find in &s;ome &s;ingle walk of greatne&s;s; but in the whole progre&s;s he is hitherto alone.</P>
<P>FOR this preeminence he was plainly fitted by nature, and education, by the manner of his life, and the field of his employment. Born with a &s;oul &s;uperior to his kind, educated in the fir&s;t &s;chool of wi&s;dom, trained to arms, and to policy, in the mo&s;t improved and powerful court in the world, and nur|tured in wi&s;dom &s;till more &s;ublime in the quiet re|treats of Midian, he came forth to his great &s;cene of public action, with the mo&s;t happy preparation both for &s;ucce&s;s and glory. God was about to ac|compli&s;h a more important revolution than had ever taken place, and had formed and fini&s;hed the in&s;tru|ment, which &s;o illu&s;trious a de&s;ign required.</P>
<P>IN whatever cour&s;e of life, in whatever branch of character, we trace this great man, we find al|mo&s;t every thing to approve, and love, and &s;carcely any thing to lament, or cen&s;ure. When we &s;ee him at the burning bu&s;h, &s;acrificing his diffidence to his duty, and re&s;olving finally to attempt the fir&s;t great liberation of mankind; when we accompany him to the pre&s;ence of Pharaoh, and hear him demand the relea&s;e of the mi&s;erable victims of his tyranny; when we behold him laying Egypt wa&s;te, and &s;um|moning all the great engines of terror and de&s;truc|tion to overcome the ob&s;tinacy and wickedne&s;s of her monarch; when we follow him to the Red Sea, and behold the waters divide at his command, to o|pen a pa&s;&s;age for the millions of I&s;rael; and at the &s;ame command return, to deluge the Egyptian ho&s;t; when we trace him through the wonders of Sinai, and of the wilderne&s;s; when we mark his &s;teady faith in God, his undoubting obedience to every divine command, his unexampled patrioti&s;m, im|movable by ingratitude, rebellion, and in&s;ult, his cheerful communication of every office of power and
<PB N="11" REF="037339_0010_100CEAD0D3EE91D0">
profit to others, and his equally cheerful exclu&s;ion of his own de&s;cendants from all places of di&s;tinction; when we con&s;ider his glorious integrity in adhering always to the duties of his office, un&s;educed by power and &s;plendour, unmoved by national and &s;in|gular homage, unawed by faction and oppo&s;ition, undaunted by danger and difficulty, and unaltered by provocation, obloquy, and di&s;tre&s;s; when we &s;ee him meek beyond example, and patient and per+&s;evering, through forty years of declining life, in toil, hazard, and trial; when we read in his writings the frank records of his own failings, and tho&s;e of his family, friends, and nation, and the fir&s;t efforts of the hi&s;torian, the poet, the orator, and the law-giver; when we &s;ee all the duties of &s;elf government, benevolence, and piety, which he taught, exactly di&s;played in a life approximating to angelic virtue; when we behold him the deliverer of his nation, the re&s;torer of truth, the pillar of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and the reformer of mankind; his whole character &s;hines with a radiance, like the &s;plendour, which his face derived from the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and on which the human eye could not endure to look. He is every where the &s;ame glorious per&s;on; the Man of God; &s;elected from the race of Adam; called up into the mountain, that burned with fire; a&s;cending to meet his Creator; embo&s;oming him|&s;elf in the clouds of Sinai; walking calmly onward through the thunders and lightnings; and &s;erenely advancing to the immediate pre&s;ence, and conver&s;e, of Jehovah. He is the greate&s;t of all prophets; the fir&s;t type of the Saviour; conducted to Pi&s;gah, unclothed of mortal fle&s;h, and entombed in the du&s;t, by the immediate hand of the Mo&s;t High.</P>
<P>IN a &s;phere, in &s;ome re&s;pects le&s;s &s;plendid, but in the eye of wi&s;dom and virtue &s;carcely le&s;s honour|able, Paul, al&s;o, ro&s;e to fini&s;hed glory and great|ne&s;s, as the enlightener, and reformer of mankind.
<PB N="12" REF="037339_0011_100CEAD2C8675A18">
He was not, like Mo&s;es, the emancipator of a na|tion, the head of a new church, or the founder of an empire; but he was the mo&s;t illu&s;trious follower of the Son of God, in e&s;tabli&s;hing Chri&s;tianity, and in accompli&s;hing the &s;alvation of men. No labours of man claim a higher moral di&s;tinction, than his; no mind was ever &s;o expanded, or elevated, with the noble&s;t knowledge; no heart was probably ever warmed with more various, or more exalted virtue. No man ever &s;truggled more firmly with dangers; or ro&s;e more gloriou&s;ly above difficulties; regarded friends with more affection, or enemies with more compa&s;&s;ion; felt for him&s;elf le&s;s, or his fellow men more; or attained a more &s;ublime and unmingled piety, than Paul. To his labours mankind are, di|rectly, more indebted, than to tho&s;e of any other man, for the moral wi&s;dom, the virtue, the peace, and the happine&s;s, which they now enjoy.</P>
<P>SUCH excellence we are not to look for among tho&s;e, who have received no &s;upernatural a&s;&s;i&s;tance; yet, in &s;imilar revolutions of empire, &s;imilar eman|cipations of mankind, and &s;imilar renovations of the human character, both talents and virtues have ap|peared with high lu&s;tre and dignity. As proofs of this a&s;&s;ertion, many names of no &s;mall celebrity might be recited here, were it nece&s;&s;ary; but it will be &s;ufficient for the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, to mention three only, as di&s;tingui&s;hed, in my view at lea&s;t, a|bove others. The&s;e are the fir&s;t, and &s;econd Gu&s;|tavus, of Sweden, and Alfred the Great, of England. Were not his character clouded by &s;ome &s;erious de|fects, I &s;hould add to this li&s;t Henry the fourth, of France.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Gu&s;tavus accompli&s;hed for Sweden what the great man, who&s;e character and death we are a&s;&s;embled to commemorate, accompli&s;hed for us; a deliverance from political thraldom, and the
<PB N="13" REF="037339_0012_100CEAD4B989A510">
e&s;tabli&s;hment of political freedom and &s;afety. Illu&s;|triou&s;ly de&s;cended, di&s;tingui&s;hed in early youth for a &s;eries of honourable actions, and already the ob|ject of governmental confidence and public hope, he was trepanned by the treachery of Chri&s;tiern the third, of Denmark, one of the mo&s;t faithle&s;s, proud, and bloody tyrants, that ever di&s;graced the name of man; was thrown into pri&s;on, and &s;ecretly order|ed to be put to death; &s;olely becau&s;e his claims of power in Sweden were great, and his worth gave the faire&s;t promi&s;e of &s;eeing them &s;ub&s;tantiated. Relea&s;ed from his dungeon by the good offices of a generous Dani&s;h Nobleman, he e&s;caped through many dangers to his native country. There friend|le&s;s, for&s;aken, &s;een only to be &s;hunned, and known only to excite the dread of death for not betraying him to Chri&s;tiern, he at length betook him&s;elf to the mountains of Dalecarlia; a province yet but half &s;ubdued, and inhabited by a generous band of pea|&s;ants, glowing with the unconquerable love of liber|ty. Here unknown but by di&s;tant rumour, without authority, without a friend, without a &s;hilling, and hunted by the U&s;urper and his creatures through every &s;olitude and cell, he wrought in the mines, to procure his daily bread. But &s;uch a man cannot be long ob&s;cured. The pea&s;ants of Dalecarlia he found &s;till brave and &s;incere, and boldly invited them to victory and freedom. Charmed by his dignity and gracefulne&s;s of per&s;on and demeanour, fa&s;cina|ted by his eloquence, and &s;ecure under his conduct and bravery, the&s;e plain men followed him eagerly into the field of conflict; to any other a field of de&s;|pair; to him, of hope and triumph. At their head, he met the veterans of Denmark, only to defeat them; and &s;at down before their ca&s;tles, only to take them. Within a &s;hort period, he overran, and redeemed the whole of his native country; every where pre&s;ent; the animating, informing, directing
<PB N="14" REF="037339_0013_100CEAD728AE6DC0">
principle of the army, and of the nation; and by the unanimous voice of the E&s;tates was advanced to the throne. In this high &s;tation, enjoying every te&s;timony of public re&s;pect &s;hort of adoration, for his di&s;tingui&s;hed wi&s;dom, gallantry, patrioti&s;m, and piety, he revived the agriculture, renewed the wa&s;t|ed cities and villages, re&s;tored the commerce, re-e&s;tabli&s;hed and improved the ju&s;tice, &s;ecured the li|berty, reformed the religion, and engro&s;&s;ed the hearts, of his grateful nation.

<P>THE &s;econd Gu&s;tavus, having, from the age of 18, reigned in Sweden, with &s;ingular wi&s;dom, equity, and glory, for twenty years, appeared in Germany, 1631, in the illu&s;trious character of Defender of the Prote&s;tant religion, again&s;t the la&s;t great efforts of the Catholics, in that country, for its de&s;truction; and gloriou&s;ly lo&s;t his life in e&s;tabli&s;hing the cau&s;e, for which he died.

Nor was the military pro|gre&s;s of any leader equally rapid, under circum&s;tan|ces equally difficult; with an inferiour force, a|gain&s;t warlike nations, and di&s;ciplined troops, com|manded by able and experienced generals."</P>

<P>"THE merit of Alfred (&s;ays Hume) both in public and private life, may with advantage be &s;et in oppo&s;ition to that of any monarch or citizen, which the annals of any age or nation can pre&s;ent to us.

<P>AS a fourth in this dignified groupe, may, with the fulle&s;t confidence, be placed the hero, &s;tate&s;man, and father, of our own country. I have introduced a &s;ummary account of the&s;e great men into this di&s;|cour&s;e, that by comparing his character with theirs, and &s;eeing them &s;tand &s;ide by &s;ide, my audience may be enabled to form a more accurate e&s;timate of his worth. Greatne&s;s is a term wholly comparative; its true import is, therefore, to be &s;een by compari|&s;on only. On the one hand, &s;uperiority to the com|mon ma&s;s, and on the other approximation, equali|ty, or eminence, with re&s;pect to &s;uch as have been thus &s;uperior, is all that is intended by the word. As Mo&s;es and Paul were the greate&s;t human cha|racters among &s;uch as have been &s;upernaturally a&s;|&s;i&s;ted; and the three princes, whom I have here characterized, were, if I mi&s;take not, the fir&s;t a|mong tho&s;e, who have become great by means mere|ly natural; to &s;u&s;tain a fair re&s;emblance to the&s;e men mu&s;t be highly honourable; to be near them, an enviable di&s;tinction; to equal them, the crown of the mo&s;t exalted ambition.</P>
<P>AS the &s;phere of Paul's exertions was peculiar, he mu&s;t of cour&s;e be pa&s;&s;ed by in &s;uch a de&s;ign. As Mo&s;es was in&s;pired, and &s;u&s;tained by a peculiar agency of the Mo&s;t High, the compari&s;on with him
<PB N="17" REF="037339_0016_100CEADD5148A6F0">
mu&s;t in many re&s;pects be unfairly in&s;tituted. Yet a &s;trong re&s;emblance between him and the hero of our own country is &s;o evident, that the recital of it is become almo&s;t proverbial. The occa&s;ions, the ta|lents, the virtues, the divine interpo&s;itions, and the i&s;&s;ue, were &s;o &s;imilar, as to &s;trike the mo&s;t undi&s;cri|minating eye, and to find an ea&s;y acknowledgment from every tongue. Particularly, the preeminence of Mo&s;es to all the great men in I&s;rael, marked &s;o &s;trongly in the text, and the like di&s;tinction ju&s;tly claimed by the American leader, not only over his countrymen, but over all men of the pre&s;ent age, form a mo&s;t honourable ground of compari&s;on.</P>
<P>THAT General Wa&s;hington is, with propriety, introduced as a proper companion to the three il|lu&s;trious princes, whom I have mentioned above, as a companion, whom, on equal terms, they may be fairly &s;uppo&s;ed cheerfully to welcome to their num|ber and rank, will, I tru&s;t, appear from a ju&s;t ac|count of his character.</P>
<P>THERE are two methods, in which &s;uch an ac|count may be advantageou&s;ly given; a recital of what he has done, and an exhibition of the attri|butes which he manife&s;ted.</P>
<P>IN very early life, he began to be, in a &s;en&s;e pro|phetically, di&s;tingui&s;hed for wi&s;dom and conduct &s;uperior to his years; and executed &s;o ably &s;everal important commi&s;&s;ions, which he received from the legi&s;lature of Virginia, as to &s;ecure their confidence, and command the applau&s;e of the whole country. Such tru&s;ts have been rarely committed to &s;o young a man, and have probably been never better lodged in the hands of any man. That in the exi&s;ting cir|cum&s;tances &s;ucce&s;s was, in one of the ca&s;es, comple|tely atchieved, that, in a &s;econd, &s;o little di&s;a&s;ter en&s;u|ed;
<PB N="18" REF="037339_0017_100CEADF4BF3FF60">
and that, in a third, total ruin was prevented; is plainly and chiefly to be attributed to the &s;kill and firmne&s;s of a youth between nineteen and twenty-three, acting in the la&s;t ca&s;e only in a voluntary office.</P>
<P>AFTER acquiring, both in public and private life, the univer&s;al e&s;teem, through the following &s;ea|&s;on of peace, he was cho&s;en, in the year 1774, one of the Repre&s;entatives in the fir&s;t Congre&s;s. Here his former reputation, and the proofs which he dai|ly gave of &s;uperiour wi&s;dom and worth, induced that body to choo&s;e him, in 1775, commander in chief of the American armies, employed to re&s;i&s;t the ho&s;|tilities of Great-Britain. This hazardous office he accepted with a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note B.</NOTE> mode&s;ty, which always accompa|nies and announces merit, and with a firmne&s;s of deci&s;ion, which no future embarra&s;&s;ment could move. Under a government ju&s;t formed, and marked with infantine weakne&s;s; in a country com|po&s;ed of &s;eparate and deranged &s;overeignties; amid&s;t a people now fir&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly connected; at the head of armies formed of mere militia, a band of &s;couts and yet to be made &s;oldiers, and of officers ignorant of the di&s;cipline which they were to teach, and of the movements which they were to guide; &s;trangers, rivals, and &s;ometimes enemies; without ammunition, arms, clothes, or money; enli&s;ted for a &s;ummer; and plunged by inexperience into all the expo&s;ures, di&s;couragements, di&s;ea&s;es, and mi&s;eries, of unpro|vided military life; he became the body of union to the people, and to the &s;oldiery, guided the one to wi&s;dom, and led the other to victory. In his own letters,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Note C.</NOTE> not le&s;s illu&s;trious commentaries than tho&s;e of Cae&s;ar, and on a more glorious war, he is &s;een, through the veil of his mode&s;ty, to have been the pillar, on which the country &s;u&s;pended it&s;elf; the
<PB N="19" REF="037339_0018_100CEAE0E00EB5F8">
&s;oul, by which the army was formed, quickened, and actuated. In the mid&s;t of the immen&s;e and mo|mentous concerns, lying alway on his mind, no want, nor its &s;upply; no &s;uffering, nor its relief; no evil, nor its remedy; no improvement in the affairs of the army, or the country, nor the means by which it might be be&s;t accompli&s;hed; eluded his attention. He is there proved, and without intend|ing it, to have been the &s;ource of almo&s;t every im|portant mea&s;ure, the origin of the great ma&s;s of me|liorations, in our &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>IN this war, for which we were &s;o unfurni&s;hed, as to render it, in the eye of &s;ober judgment, more like Quixoti&s;m than ju&s;tifiable enterpri&s;e, his cauti|ous wi&s;dom, more nece&s;&s;ary, more varied, and more extraordinary, than that of the celebrated Ro|man, ju&s;tly gained him, abroad, as well as at home, the title of the American Fabius. To the minds of un&s;kilful, ardent, and partial judges, however, this wi&s;dom, without which we now clearly &s;ee our country mu&s;t have been lo&s;t, appeared to re&s;ult from imbecility and fear. So far did this opinion, toge|ther with &s;ome concurring circum&s;tances, operate, as to engender a &s;erious attempt to rai&s;e a foreigner, in every re&s;pect his inferiour, to the &s;upreme com|mand. Had not this childi&s;h and wretched at|tempt been ably and &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed, had not the great body of officers of di&s;tinction &s;olemnly pledged them&s;elves to each other never to &s;erve, while he lived, under any other commander, there is rea|&s;on to fear, that it would have &s;ucceeded. Of this glaring attempt again&s;t him his mind, &s;uperior alike to &s;avour and to frowns, took no other notice, than what has been buried in &s;ilence. Satisfied with him&s;elf, and &s;trong in the attachment of tho&s;e whom he commanded, he ro&s;e above every attack, dan|ger, and enemy.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="037339_0019_100CEAE284694D90">A country, an army, &s;ituated as were ours, car|ried misfortune in their face. The country was un|&s;killed and unfurni&s;hed; and its councils, compo&s;ed indeed of great and good men, were yet in no de|gree ver&s;ed in the bu&s;ine&s;s, which they were now called to direct. The army was formed of brave and hardy &s;oldiers, and of gallant and &s;en&s;ible offi|cers; but it was gathered, and di&s;per&s;ed, in a day; and, when mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, and pre&s;ented with the faire&s;t opportunities of &s;ucce&s;sful enterpri&s;e, had di&s;|appeared. Never did he appear greater, than in the&s;e &s;ea&s;ons of trial and depre&s;&s;ion. No enterpri&s;es of his &s;hine with more lu&s;tre, than his decampment from <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note D</NOTE>Long-I&s;land, his retreat from General Howe through New-Jer&s;ey, his de&s;cent upon Trenton, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Note E.</NOTE> his elu&s;ion of Lord Cornwallis at Trenton, his con|&s;equent march through New-Jer&s;ey, in which he defeated the Briti&s;h corps at Princeton, and the ad|dre&s;s, with which he pre&s;erved the appearance of a con&s;iderable force at Morri&s;town, where, through the winter, he had only eleven or twelve hundred men, and the&s;e under a &s;ucce&s;&s;ive inoculation, to re|&s;i&s;t the whole Briti&s;h army.</P>
<P>BUT his military life had al&s;o its &s;ea&s;ons of pro&s;pe|rity. His &s;ucce&s;&s;es were, however, almo&s;t always obtained at the head of a force, inferior to that of his enemy, and of con&s;equence were, in an eminent degree, the re&s;ult of his own efforts. Like the il|lu&s;trious men, to whom I have compared him, he had the happine&s;s of ending the great controver&s;y, in which he had engaged, and in which his country was the &s;take, with a final and complete triumph. All that, for which he fought, and that the greate&s;t prize, which excites human contention, he gained; and lived long enough to reap a glorious reward of
<PB N="21" REF="037339_0020_100CEAE4949D7B28">
his labours in the peace and &s;afety, the veneration and ble&s;&s;ings, of his countrymen.</P>
<P>HIS political, was not le&s;s honorable than his mi|litary, career. When, under the weakne&s;s and in|efficiency of the Confederation, the&s;e States were falling a&s;under, and tumbling into anarchy and ruin, he contributed, at the head of the General Conven|tion, more, by his wi&s;dom, virtue and influence, than any other man, to the final adoption of the Fe|deral Con&s;titution; and thus &s;aved his country a &s;econd time. Twice &s;ummoned by the unanimous voice of the nation to the Pre&s;idency of the General Government, he there, in a &s;eries of wi&s;e, firm, and generous mea&s;ures, &s;tepped often between the State and de&s;truction. His Proclamation of Neutrality, particularly, was the hinge, on which, at that time, the whole well being of our country turned. No public mea&s;ure was ever more nece&s;&s;ary, more happi|ly timed, or more prudently conducted. To that mea&s;ure is it probably owing, that we are allowed thus peaceably to a&s;&s;emble, this day, in honour to his memory.</P>
<P>THE lu&s;tre of all his military and political actions, and the glory of his whole character, apparently in|capable of addition, he has neverthele&s;s enhanced by two &s;ingular traits of di&s;tinction; his refu&s;al to accept of a compen&s;ation for his &s;ervices; and has repeated, voluntary re&s;ignation of his high offices, whil&s;t in the entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of univer&s;al veneration, and perfectly a&s;&s;ured of the unanimous public &s;uf|frage. I do not here intend, that great men ought of cour&s;e to decline pecuniary rewards; or to retire, in all circum&s;tances, from public to private life. It could not have been the duty of either of the prin|ces, who&s;e character I have given. But no duty forbade him to do both; and in doing both he has
<PB N="22" REF="037339_0021_100CEAE707BDB080">
&s;ecured a glory, which is &s;ingular. Nothing could have &s;o di&s;covered his &s;elfpo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, evinced his &s;u|periority to ambition, or proved his mind to be the re&s;idence of patrioti&s;m and principle.</P>
<P>IN private life he was the &s;ame dignified charact|er. All his affairs were &s;uperintended by him&s;elf, and were of cour&s;e always in exact order and pro&s;per|ous thrift. To his neighbours, to the public, to all men, he was ju&s;t, generous, and humane; to the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note F.</NOTE> poor a &s;teady, and con&s;picuous benefactor; and to his family whatever is found in the fulle&s;t and mo&s;t a|miable di&s;charge of the dome&s;tic duties.</P>
<P>THROUGH the plantation, on which he re&s;ided, ran a &s;tream, &s;tored with fi&s;h. This fi&s;hery two days in the week he made, together with his own boats and nets, the property of the &s;urrounding poor; and frequently directed his &s;ervants to aid them in taking and curing their booty.</P>
<P>IN the cour&s;e of the war, he wrote, as I have been well informed, to his friends in Virginia, a propo&s;al to free his &s;ervants, &s;hould the Legi&s;lature think it con&s;i&s;tent with the general welfare. This plan he has realized in his will; and the public are already informed, that it will be &s;peedily executed by his mo&s;t re&s;pectable Executrix.</P>
<P>AFTER the &s;urrender of Yorktown, he returned, at the end of eight years ab&s;ence, to vi&s;it his family. His &s;ervants had voluntarily arranged them&s;elves in two lines, from his man&s;ion hou&s;e to the creek which runs before the door. When he came in &s;ight, the&s;e humble and affectionate dome&s;tics &s;ent up a &s;hout of joy, and uttered an extravagance of tran&s;|port; the women by &s;hrieking, beating their brea&s;ts, and rending their hair; and the men by cries and tears, and all the ge&s;ticulations, with which nature,
<PB N="23" REF="037339_0022_100CEAE932B35AD8">
in uninformed and unpoli&s;hed &s;ociety, gives vent to exce&s;&s;ive pa&s;&s;ion. When he had cro&s;&s;ed the creek, he delayed his progre&s;s to his beloved abode, to &s;hake all the adults by the hand, and to &s;peak ten|derly and affectionately to the children. "Never," &s;aid the gentleman, from whom I received this in|formation, "was I &s;o delightfully affected, except at the &s;urrender of Yorktown; and then, only be|cau&s;e I con&s;idered the independence of my country as &s;ecured."</P>
<P>ON the attributes, manife&s;ted by this great man in his conduct, I beg leave to make the following ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>GENERAL WASHINGTON was great, not by means of that brilliancy of mind, often appropriately term|ed genius, and u&s;ually coveted for our&s;elves, and our children; and almo&s;t as u&s;ually attended with qualities, which preclude wi&s;dom, and depreciate or forbid worth; but by a con&s;titutional character more happily formed. His mind was indeed inven|tive, and full of re&s;ources; but its energy appears to have been originally directed to that which is practical and u&s;eful, and not to that which is &s;hewy and &s;pecious. His judgment was clear and intui|tive beyond that of mo&s;t who have lived, and &s;eem|ed in&s;tinctively to di&s;cern the proper an&s;wer to the celebrated Roman que&s;tion; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What good purpo&s;e will it an&s;wer?</NOTE> Cui bono erit? To this his ince&s;&s;ant attention, and unwearied ob&s;erva|tion, which nothing, whether great or minute, e&s;ca|ped, doubtle&s;s contributed in a high degree. What he ob&s;erved he trea&s;ured up, and thus added daily to his &s;tock of u&s;eful knowledge. Hence, although his early education was in a degree confined, his mind became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of exten&s;ive, various, and ex|act information. Perhaps there never was a mind,
<PB N="24" REF="037339_0023_100CEAEB0D188230">
on which theoretical &s;peculations had le&s;s influence, and the deci&s;ions of common &s;en&s;e more.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time, no man ever more earne&s;tly or uniformly &s;ought advice, or regarded it, when given, with more critical attention. The opinions of friends and enemies, of tho&s;e who abetted, and of tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed, his own &s;y&s;tem, he explored and &s;ecured alike. His own opinions, al&s;o, he &s;ub|mitted to his proper coun&s;ellours, and often to oth|ers; with a demand, that they &s;hould be &s;ifted, and expo&s;ed, without any tenderne&s;s to them becau&s;e they were his; in&s;i&s;ting, that they &s;hould be con&s;i|dered as opinions merely, and, as &s;uch, &s;hould be &s;ubjected to the free&s;t and mo&s;t &s;evere inve&s;tigation.</P>
<P>WHEN any mea&s;ure of importance was to be acted on, he delayed the formation of his judgment until the la&s;t moment; that he might &s;ecure to him&s;elf, alway, the benefit of every hint, opinion, and cir|cum&s;tance, which might contribute either to con|firm, or change, his deci&s;ion. Hence, probably, it in a great mea&s;ure aro&s;e, that he was &s;o rarely committed; and that his deci&s;ions have &s;o rarely produced regret, and have been &s;o clearly ju&s;tified both by their con&s;equences and the judgment of mankind.</P>
<P>WITH this preparation, he formed a judgment finally and wholly his own; and although no man was ever more anxious before a mea&s;ure was adop|ted, probably no man was ever le&s;s anxious after|ward. He had done his duty, and left the i&s;&s;ue to Providence.</P>
<P>TO all this conduct his high independence of mind greatly contributed. By this I intend a &s;pi|rit, which dares to do its duty, again&s;t friends and
<PB N="25" REF="037339_0024_100CEAEE041A4718">
enemies, and in pro&s;perous and adver&s;e circum&s;tan|ces, alike; and which, when it has done its duty, is regardle&s;s of opinions and con&s;equences.</P>
<P>NOR was he le&s;s indebted to his peculiar <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note G.</NOTE> firm|ne&s;s. He not only dared to act in this manner, but uniformly &s;u&s;tained the &s;ame tone of thought and feeling, &s;uch, as he was at the deci&s;ion, he ever after continued to be; and all men de&s;paired of ope|rating on him unle&s;s through the medium of con|viction. The &s;ame unchanging &s;pirit &s;upported him through every part of his a&s;toni&s;hing trials, du|ring the war; and exhibited him as exactly the &s;ame man after a defeat, as after a victory; neither elated nor depre&s;&s;ed, but always grave, &s;erene, and prepared for the event.</P>
<P>FROM other great men he was di&s;tingui&s;hed by an exemption from favouriti&s;m. No man ever &s;o en|gro&s;&s;ed his attachment, as to be &s;afe, for a moment, from de&s;erved reproof, or cen&s;ure; nor was any man ever &s;o di&s;reli&s;hed by him, as, on that account, to fail of receiving from him whatever applau&s;e, or &s;ervices, his merit could claim. Hence his friends feared, and his enemies re&s;pected him.</P>
<P>HIS moderation and &s;elf government were &s;uch that he was always in his own power, and never in the power of any other per&s;on. Whatever pa&s;&s;ions he felt, they rarely appeared. His conduct, opini|ons, and life, wore unu&s;ually the character of mere intellect. Hence he was never found unguarded, or embarra&s;&s;ed; but was always at full liberty to do that, and that only, which expediency and duty de|manded. A &s;triking in&s;tance of this trait in his character is &s;een in the well known fact; that he ne|ver
<PB N="26" REF="037339_0025_100CEAF011612C48">
exculpated him&s;elf from any charge, nor replied to any calumny. His accu&s;ers, for &s;uch he had, had opportunity to make the mo&s;t of their accu&s;a|tions; his calumniators, if their con&s;ciences permit|ted, to &s;leep in peace.</P>
<P>HIS ju&s;tice was exact, but tempered with the ut|mo&s;t humanity, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note H.</NOTE> which the occa&s;ion would &s;uffer. His truth no &s;ober man, who knew him, probably ever doubted. Watchful again&s;t his own expo&s;ures to error, he was rarely found erring; jealous of do|ing inju&s;tice, if he has done inju&s;tice, it is yet, I be|lieve, unrecorded.</P>
<P>HIS re&s;ervedne&s;s has been at times cen&s;ured. To me it appears to have been an important and nece&s;|&s;ary characteri&s;tic of a per&s;on &s;ituated as he was. In familiar life a communicative di&s;po&s;ition is gene|rally plea&s;ing, and often u&s;eful; in his high &s;tations it would have been dangerous. One unguarded or ambiguous expre&s;&s;ion might have produced evils, the remedy of which would have been beyond even his own power. No &s;uch expre&s;&s;ion is recorded of him.</P>
<P>HIS punctuality was extreme. He ro&s;e always with the dawn; he dined at a given minute; he attended every appointment at the moment. Hence his bu&s;ine&s;s public and private was always done at the proper time, and always beforehand.</P>
<P>NO per&s;on appears to have had a higher &s;en&s;e of decorum, and univer&s;al propriety. The eye&punc; fol|lowing his public and private life, traces an unex|ceptionable propriety, an exact decorum, in every action; in every word; in his demeanour to men of every cla&s;s; in his public communications; in his convivial entertainments; in his letters; and in his
<PB N="27" REF="037339_0026_100CEAF1A2FDA058">
familiar conver&s;ation; from which bluntne&s;s, flatte|ry, wittici&s;m, indelicacy, negligence, pa&s;&s;ion, and overaction, were alike excluded.</P>
<P>FROM the&s;e things happily combined, always &s;een, and &s;een always in their native light, without art, or affectation, it aro&s;e, that, wherever he ap|peared, an in&s;tinctive awe and veneration attended him on the part of all men. Every man, however great in his own opinion, or in reality, &s;hrunk in his pre&s;ence, and became con&s;cious of an inferiority, which he never felt before. Whil&s;t he encouraged every man, particularly every &s;tranger, and peculi|arly every diffident man, and rai&s;ed him to &s;elf-po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, no &s;ober per&s;on, however &s;ecure he might think him&s;elf of his e&s;teem, ever pre&s;umed to draw too near him.</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to his religious character there have been different opinions. No one will be &s;urpri&s;ed at this, who reflects, that this is a &s;ubject, about which, in all circum&s;tances not involving in&s;pired te&s;timony, doubts may and will exi&s;t. The evidence concern|ing it mu&s;t of cour&s;e ari&s;e from an induction of par|ticulars. Some will induce more of the&s;e particu|lars, and others &s;ewer; &s;ome will re&s;t on one cla&s;s, or collection, others on another; and &s;ome will give more, and others le&s;s, weight to tho&s;e which are in|duced; according to their &s;everal modes, and &s;tand|ards, of judging. The que&s;tion in this, and all o|ther ca&s;es, mu&s;t be finally determined before another tribunal, than that of human judgment; and to that tribunal it mu&s;t ultimately be le&s;t. For my own part, I have con&s;idered his numerous and uniform public and mo&s;t &s;olemn declarations of his high ve|neration for religion, his exemplary and edifying at|tention to public wor&s;hip, and his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> devotion, as proofs, &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy every

per&s;on, willing to be &s;atisfied. I &s;hall only add, that if he was not a Chri&s;tian, he was more like one, than any man of the &s;ame de&s;cription, who&s;e life has been hitherto recorded.</P>
<P>AS a warrior, his merit has, I believe, been fully and readily acknowledged; yet I have doubted whether it has always been ju&s;tly e&s;timated. His military greatne&s;s lay not principally in de&s;perate &s;allies of courage; in the daring and brilliant ex|ploits of a parti&s;an: The&s;e would have ill &s;uited his &s;tation, and mo&s;t probably have ruined his cau&s;e and country. It con&s;i&s;ted in the formation of exten|&s;ive and ma&s;terly <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Note I.</NOTE> plans; effectual preparations, the cautious prevention of great evils, and the watch|ful &s;eizure of every advantage; in combining hete|rogeneous materials into one military body, produ|cing a &s;y&s;tem of military and political mea&s;ures&punc; concentering univer&s;al confidence, and diffu&s;ing an <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">See Note J.</NOTE> influence next to magical; in comprehending a great &s;cheme of war, pur&s;uing a regular &s;y&s;tem of acquiring &s;trength for his country, and wearing out the &s;trength of his enemies. To his conduct, both military and political, may, with exact propriety, be applied the ob&s;ervation, which has been often made concerning his courage; that in the mo&s;t ha|zardous &s;ituations no man ever &s;aw his countenance change.</P>
<P>PERHAPS, I &s;hall be thought to have dwelt too long, and too minutely, on his character. I hope I &s;hall be ju&s;tified, partially at lea&s;t, when it is re|membered, that I have been &s;eizing the be&s;t oppor|tunity, which I &s;hall ever enjoy, of teaching, in the mo&s;t affecting manner in my power, the youths committed to my in&s;truction, and forming a part of

<P>SUCH, my friends and fellow citizens, was the man, who&s;e death we are a&s;&s;embled to lament, and who&s;e worth we commemorate. Like the illu&s;tri|ous &s;ubject of my text he &s;tands alone in his nati|on. Like him he was great in the &s;plendor of de|&s;ignation, in wi&s;dom, in effort, in &s;ucce&s;s, in the im|portance of his talents, virtues and labours, to the nation over whom he pre&s;ided in war and peace; in the e&s;timation, the love, and the tears, of his country. On this re&s;emblance I have dwelt le&s;s, becau&s;e I &s;uppo&s;e others have dwelt more; yet I can|not forbear to add, that in the death of the&s;e di&s;tin|gui&s;hed men there is a &s;imilarity not a little &s;triking. Both died in advanced years, but without any previ|ous decay of faculties, or glory; both left their re&s;|pective nations, not indeed e&s;tabli&s;hed, but &s;o far advanced, as not ab&s;olutely to demand a continuance of their &s;uperintendency; and both were honored by a national and &s;pontaneous mourning, as the la&s;t tribute of public veneration. Miraculous &s;upport our nation could not hope for under any leader; but the &s;ignal interpo&s;itions of Heaven in our behalf, while under his guidance, ought never to be for|gotten.</P>
<P>TO Americans his name will be ever dear; a &s;a|vour of &s;weet incen&s;e, de&s;cending to every &s;ucceed|ing generation. The things, which he has done, are too great, too intere&s;ting, ever to be forgotten. Every object which we &s;ee, every employment in which we are engaged, every comfort which we en|ioy, reminds us daily of his character. The general peace, liberty, religion, &s;afety, and pro&s;perity, &s;trong|ly impre&s;s, in every place, what he has done, &s;uffer|ed, and atchieved. When a Legi&s;lature a&s;&s;embles
<PB N="30" REF="037339_0029_100CEAF8A781AD90">
to enact laws; when Courts meet to di&s;tribute ju&s;|tice; when Congregations gather to wor&s;hip God; they naturally, and almo&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, &s;ay "To Wa&s;hington it is owing, under God, that we are here." The farmer pur&s;uing his plough in peace, the mechanic following the bu&s;ine&s;s of his &s;hop in &s;afety, a&s;cribes the privilege to Wa&s;hington. The hou&s;e which, uninvaded, &s;helters us from the &s;torm, the cheerful fire&s;ide &s;urrounded by our little ones, the table &s;pread in quiet with the bounties of Providence, the bed on which we repo&s;e in undi&s;turbed &s;ecurity, utters, in &s;ilent but expre&s;&s;ive language, the memo|ry, and the prai&s;e, of Wa&s;hington. Every &s;hip bears the fruits of his labours on its wings, and ex|ultingly &s;preads its &s;treamers to his honour. The &s;tudent meets him in the &s;till and peaceful walk; the traveller &s;ees him in all the pro&s;perous and &s;mil|ing &s;cenes of his journey; and our whole country in her thrift, order, &s;afety, and morals, bears, in&s;cri|bed in &s;unbeams, throughout her hills and her plains, the name and the glory of Wa&s;hington.</P>
<P>FROM a &s;ubject &s;o &s;ingular, and &s;o edifying, it is not ea&s;y to fail of gaining u&s;eful practical in&s;tructi|on. Particularly, the ine&s;timable benefits which we have derived from the efforts of this great man. cannot but prompt every ingenuous mind to remem|ber, with uncea&s;ing gratitude, the goodne&s;s of God in be&s;towing upon us &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing; God, who formed and furni&s;hed him for labours &s;o u&s;eful, and for a life &s;o glorious. In what a manner mu&s;t the late war have clo&s;ed, had the &s;upreme command of our armies fallen to a weak or unprincipled man? What would have been its i&s;&s;ue, had the powerful attempt to di&s;place him, and to &s;ub&s;titute a foreigner, &s;ucceeded? Think, I be&s;eech you, of the uniform condition of a conquered nation; a nation too, con|&s;idered as rebels by their conquerors. Think what
<PB N="31" REF="037339_0030_100CEAFA4BF29BE8">
it would have been to have had your armies betray|ed&punc; your lands ravaged, your hou&s;es burnt, your be&s;t citizens brought to the halter, your wives and daughters di&s;honoured, and your children hou&s;ele&s;s, naked, and fami&s;hed. Think of the long and hope|le&s;s period, through which the broken &s;pirit, the ru|ined morals, the wide-&s;pread ignorance, and the lo&s;t energy, of your country would have perpetuated your mi&s;eries, and prevented your po&s;terity from e|merging again to the character of men, and the ble&s;&s;ings of freemen.</P>
<P>TO the&s;e wretched &s;cenes contra&s;t your pre&s;ent freedom, peace, &s;afety, glory, and felicity. To whom are they owing? The heart &s;pontaneou&s;ly an|&s;wer, "Fir&s;t to God, and next to Wa&s;hington." I mean not to detract from the wi&s;dom, bravery, or worth, of his generous companions in the council, and in the field. Cheerfully do I render to them the illu&s;trious honours, which they have merited, and won; and heartily do I rejoice to &s;ee tho&s;e, who &s;till live, &s;u&s;taining and increa&s;ing, in &s;o many in|&s;tances, the high e&s;timation, which they had &s;o am|ply de&s;erved of their country. But in all that I have &s;aid of their illu&s;trious Chief they will be the fir&s;t to unite, becau&s;e they have known him more intimate|ly than others. With them will all their country|men in&s;tinctively accord; for his labours have been &s;o great, &s;o good, &s;o endearing, that they cannot but be &s;eated in every American heart. May our grati|tude to the Author always accompany, and totally tran&s;cend, our admiration of the in&s;trument; let it in&s;pirit every reflection, and mingle with every joy.</P>
<P>BY him, al&s;o, are our rulers, at the pre&s;ent and at every future period, taught how to rule. The &s;ame conduct will ever produce &s;ub&s;tantially the &s;ame effects; the &s;ame public well being, the &s;ame
<PB N="32" REF="037339_0031_100CEAFCE97FA458">
glory, the &s;ame veneration. To be wi&s;e and good; to forget, or re&s;train, the dictates of pa&s;&s;ion, and o|bey tho&s;e of duty; to &s;eek &s;ingly the public wel|fare, and lo&s;e in it per&s;onal gratification; to re&s;i&s;t calmly and firmly the pa&s;&s;ions, and pur&s;ue only the intere&s;ts, of a nation, is the great &s;ecret of ruling well. When the&s;e things are exhibited in the &s;trong light of example, and crowned with &s;ucce&s;s and ho|nor, they are taught in a manner beyond mea&s;ure more impre&s;&s;ive, than can be found in rules and ar|guments. Here they are already tried, and pro|ved. Here they are &s;een &s;urrounded by all their delightful attendants, and followed by all their hap|py con&s;equences. The conviction produced is com|plete, the impre&s;&s;ion &s;upreme. From this great ex|ample all rulers may learn wi&s;dom, and our rulers more than any other. They are rulers of the very people, who loved and reverenced him, and who will, of cour&s;e, love and reverence them, &s;o far as they tread in his foot&s;teps. They, al&s;o, know and feel his character, and &s;ucce&s;s, more than is po&s;&s;ible for others. Wi&s;dom, therefore, and duty demand of them, and in a peculiar degree, &s;tudiou&s;ly to co|py &s;o glorious a pattern.</P>
<P>THE youths, al&s;o, of our country, who wi&s;h to become great, u&s;eful and honourable, will here find the be&s;t directions, and the mo&s;t powerful incite|ments. To be great, u&s;eful, and honourable, they mu&s;t re&s;emble him. The very actions, which he performed, they may indeed not be called to per|form; the &s;ufferings, which he underwent, they may not be obliged to undergo; but the attributes, which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and di&s;played, mu&s;t, in a good degree, be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and di&s;played by them al&s;o.</P>
<P>LET them particularly remember, that greatne&s;s is not the re&s;ult of mere chance, or genius; that it
<PB N="33" REF="037339_0032_100CEAFF01F4BF68">
is not the fla&s;h of brilliancy, nor the de&s;perate &s;ally of ambition; that it is, on the contrary, the combi|ned re&s;ult of &s;trong mental endowments, vigorous cultivation, honourable de&s;ign, and wi&s;e direction. It is not the glare of a meteor; glittering, dazzling, con&s;uming, and vani&s;hing; but the &s;teady and exal|ted &s;plendour of the &s;un; a &s;plendour which, while it &s;hines with preeminent brightne&s;s, warms al&s;o, enlivens, adorns, improves, and perfects, the objects, on which it &s;hines: glorious indeed by its lu&s;tre; but &s;till more glorious in the u&s;eful effects pro|duced by its power. Of this great truth the tran|&s;cendant example before us is a mo&s;t dignified ex|hibition. Let them imitate, therefore, the ince&s;&s;ant attention, the exact ob&s;ervation, the unwearied in|du&s;try, the &s;crupulous regard to advice, the &s;lowne&s;s of deci&s;ion, the cautious prudence, the nice punctu|ality, the &s;trict propriety, the independence of thought and feeling, the unwavering firmne&s;s, the unbia&s;|&s;ed impartiality, the &s;teady moderation&punc; the exact ju&s;tice, the unveering truth, the univer&s;al humanity, and the high veneration for religion, and for God, always manife&s;ted by this great man. Thus will future Wa&s;hingtons ari&s;e to ble&s;s our happy country.</P>
<P>AS a nation we may derive from him many kinds of in&s;truction and profit. This occa&s;ion will, howe|ver, allow me to in&s;i&s;t on one only: The &s;teady pur&s;uit of that policy, which he &s;o uniformly and &s;ucce&s;sfully pur&s;ued, and has &s;o forcibly recommend|ed. In his farewell to the country which he &s;o lov|ed and defended, we have his la&s;t, and to us his dy|ing words; a mo&s;t impre&s;&s;ive recommendation of the be&s;t means of our national welfare; the &s;um of all the political wi&s;dom, which he had imbibed from his va&s;t experience; the &s;ub&s;tance of that policy, by which alone our &s;afety and happine&s;s can be en&s;ur|ed. In it we are mo&s;t affectingly taught to pre&s;erve
<PB N="34" REF="037339_0033_100CEB01B98645C8">
our union; to de&s;pi&s;e trifling di&s;criminations; to reverence our con&s;titution; to reject watchfully all a&s;&s;ociations and factions, formed to oppo&s;e it; to pre&s;erve a well balanced admini&s;tration; to encou|rage literary in&s;titutions; to promote, as of primary importance, morality and religion; to cheri&s;h public credit; to ob&s;erve ju&s;tice and good faith towards all nations; to cultivate harmony and peace with all; to indulge antipathies and favouriti&s;m towards none; to re&s;i&s;t, as dangerous and deadly, all foreign influence; to connect our&s;elves, politically, as little as po&s;&s;ible; and to hold, as much as maybe, a &s;trict and perpetual neutrality towards powers at war. Here all the national intere&s;ts of America are con|&s;ulted; here all its political wi&s;dom is &s;ummed up in a &s;ingle &s;heet. Nothing can be added, nothing without injury taken away. How greatly are the&s;e precepts recommended by the character of their author, and by the &s;ucce&s;s with which they have been followed in practice. How &s;trongly are they enforced by his labours for our country, by the glo|ry which he attained while &s;teadily pur&s;uing them, and by the manner, and the time, in which they were delivered. Happy, beyond mea&s;ure, is it for the&s;e States, that he pur&s;ued them &s;o long; that they have been &s;o clo&s;ely followed by his able and virtuous &s;ucce&s;&s;or; that they are now the only poli|cy of our government, and the efficient policy of our country. Happy, beyond mea&s;ure, will it be, if our nation &s;hould henceforth make them its great political creed, and the only rule of its political mea&s;ures, at home, and abroad. Faction, party, di&s;&s;ention, will then cea&s;e; murmurs be lo&s;t in peace and pro&s;perity; intrigues be rendered infamous and hopele&s;s; foreign influence no more lift up its &s;naky head; the danger of inva&s;ion vani&s;h; the govern|ment our country totter no more; the great politi|cal problem, Whether a free and happy Republic can be durable, be finally and propitiou&s;ly &s;olved;

<P>There have been many doubts concerning the character of General Wa&s;hington, as a writer.

It may be a &s;atisfaction to my readers to be informed, that the addre&s;s to the officers of the army in reply to the letters of Major Arm&s;trong, was penned by his own hand, and never &s;een by any per&s;on, until after it was publicly delivered.

<P>The fir&s;t knowledge, which Lord Cornwallis had of the retreat of General Wa&s;hington, was in the morning; a few minutes before the noi&s;e of the cannon at Princeton was heard at Trenton.

This, howev|er, was refu&s;ed. Very early in the morning, Lord Corn|wallis, while in bed, was informed, that Gen<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters"> Wa&s;hing|ton had decamped.

<P>Among the plans devi&s;ed by General Wa&s;hington for mi|litary operations, and expre&s;&s;ive of his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of mind, I beg leave to mention the plan for attacking the Briti&s;h on the Delaware, in three points at once, of which only the attack on Col.

<P>To the&s;e ought to be added a bold and ma&s;terly de&s;ign of attacking the whole Briti&s;h force on New-York I&s;land, near the clo&s;e of the campaign in 1782. In this de&s;ign Col. Talmadge was to have attacked the enemy on Long-I&s;land, the preceeding night, with a body of 750 choice troops, and thence to have marched on hor&s;eback to Hell-Gate, where boats, ready to receive him, were to have tran&s;ported the corps to the oppo&s;ite &s;hore. Another body under the command of a General Officer was to have marched to King&s;bridge, to attack the enemy in front, and to keep them in full expectation of being a&s;&s;aulted there only: while the main body of the army was to have gone

in boats down Hud&s;on's River, and, landing below the ene|my in the night, was to have made the principal attack on their rear. The American army was at this time in great force, and perfectly di&s;ciplined and &s;upplied. Had this de|&s;ign been attempted, there is every rea&s;on to believe, that, attacked at one moment, in front, flank and rear, at day-break, and with total &s;urpri&s;e, the triumph over them mu&s;t in all probability have been complete. It was prevented by a circum&s;tance wholly providential. Two Briti&s;h frigates moved up the North River the preceeding day, anchored directly oppo&s;ite to the American army, and thus prevented the intended embarkation. There is not a rea&s;on to ima|gine, that the Briti&s;h commander had a &s;u&s;picion of the de|&s;ign formed again&s;t him. It is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> happy, that it mi&s;|carried; for the provi&s;ional articles of peace had been alrea|dy &s;igned in Europe. Of the above de&s;ign I have the be&s;t information.</P>

<P>[In no period of General Wa&s;hington's military life did his talents and commanding influence appear more con&s;picuous than at the battle of Monmouth. The flower of the army under General Lee were retreating before the enemy, and almo&s;t without having made any re&s;i&s;tance. When they were thus thrown back upon General Wa&s;hington, at the head of his fatigued and ill&s;upplied army, it is &s;urpri&s;ing, that the panic did not become general. General Wa&s;hing|ton brought his own troops forward, checked the Briti&s;h, and &s;oon convinced Lee's flying troops, not only, that there was no occa&s;ion for their retreat, but that they could defeat the enemy. General Wa&s;hington never had full credit for this heroic exploit; and it has been thought, that if full ju&s;tice had been done by the Courtmartial, General Lee would have been ca&s;hiered.]</P>
<P>[His a&s;toni&s;hing power of commanding the minds of men was often exemplified in quieting mutinies, of which he had too many during his military cour&s;e. But no writer has done him justice for his Fabian conduct when the army was on the borders of di&s;banding. Some well written inflam|matory pieces were addre&s;&s;ed to the army, after the prelimi|nary articles of peace had been &s;igned, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> them not to lay down their arms, until the country &s;hould do them ju&s;|tice.

<HEAD>THE PRESIDENT's ADDRESS. TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>FRIENDS AND FELLOW-CITIZENS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE period for a new election of a Citizen, to admini|&s;ter the executive government of the United States, being not far di&s;tant, and the time actually arrived, when your thoughts mu&s;t be employed in de&s;ignating the per&s;on, who is to be cloathed with that important tru&s;t, it appears to me proper, e&s;pecially <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> may conduce to a more di&s;tinct ex|pre&s;&s;ion of the public voice, that I &s;hould now appri&s;e you of the re&s;olution I have formed, to decline being con&s;idered among the number of tho&s;e, out of whom a choice is to be made.</P>
<P>I beg you, at the &s;ame time, to do me the ju&s;tice to be a&s;&s;ured, that this re&s;olution has not been taken, without a &s;trict regard to all the con&s;iderations appertaining to the re|lation, which binds a dutiful citizen to his country; and that, in withdrawing the tender of &s;ervice which &s;ilence in my &s;ituation might imply, I am influenced by no diminution of zeal for your future intere&s;t; no deficiency of grateful re&s;pect for your pa&s;t kindne&s;s: But am &s;upported by a full conviction that the &s;tep is compatable with both.</P>
<P>The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in the office to which your &s;uffrages have twice called me, have been a uniform &s;acrifice of inclination to the opinion of duty, and to a deference for what appeared to be your de&s;ire. I con|&s;tantly hoped, that it would have been much earlier in my power con&s;i&s;tently with motives, which I was not at liberty to di&s;regard, to return to that retirement, from which I had been reluctantly drawn. The &s;trength of my inclina|tion to do this, previous to the la&s;t election, had even led to the preparation of an addre&s;s to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then perplexed and critical po&s;ture of affairs with foreign nations, and the unanimous advice of
<PB N="41" REF="037339_0040_100CEB11B8636CC0">
per&s;ons entitled to my confidence, impelled me to abandon the idea.</P>
<P>I rejoice, that the &s;tate of your concerns external as well as internal, no longer renders the pur&s;uit of inclination in|compatible with the &s;entiment of duty, or propriety: And am per&s;uaded whatever partiality may be retained for my &s;ervice, that in the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of our country, you will not di&s;approve my determination to retire.</P>
<P>The impre&s;&s;ions with which I fir&s;t undertook the arduous tru&s;t, were explained on the proper occa&s;ion. In the di&s;|charge of this tru&s;t. I will only &s;ay, that I have with good intentions, contributed towards the organization and admi|ni&s;tration of the government, the be&s;t exertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. Not uncon&s;cious, in the out-&s;et, of the inferiority of my qualifications, experi|ence in my own eyes, perhaps &s;till more in the eyes of others, has &s;trengthened the motives to diffidence of my&s;elf: And every day the increa&s;ing weight of years admoni&s;hes me more and more, that the &s;hade of retirement is as nece&s;&s;ary to me as it will be welcome. Satisfied that if any circum|&s;tances have given peculiar value to my &s;ervices, they were temporary, I have the con&s;olation to believe, that while choice and prudence invite me to quit the political &s;cene, patrioti&s;m does not forbid it.</P>
<P>In looking forward to the moment, which is intended to terminate the career of my public life, my feelings do not permit me to &s;u&s;pend the deep acknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my beloved country, for the many honors it has conferred upon me; &s;till more for the &s;tedfa&s;t confidence with which it has &s;upported me; and for the opportunities I have thence enjoyed of manife&s;ting my inviolable attachment, by &s;ervices faithful and per&s;evering, though in u&s;efulne&s;s unequal to my zeal.&mdash;If benefits have re&s;ulted to our country from the&s;e &s;ervices, let it always be remembered to our prai&s;e, and as an in&s;tructive example in our annals, that under circum&s;tances in which the pa&s;&s;ions, agitated in every direction, were liable to mi&s;lead, amid&s;t appearances &s;ometimes dubious&mdash;vici&s;&s;itudes of fortune, of|ten di&s;couraging in &s;ituations, in which not unfrequently want of &s;ucce&s;s has countenanced the &s;pirit of critici&s;m&mdash;the con&s;tancy of your &s;upport was the e&s;&s;ential prop of the ef|forts, and a gurantee of the plans by which they were af|fected.
<PB N="42" REF="037339_0041_100CEB134A3766F8">
Profoundly penetrated with this idea, I &s;hall car|ry it with me to my grave, as a &s;trong incitement to un|cea&s;ing vows, that Heaven may continue to you the choi|ce&s;t tokens of its benificence&mdash;that your union and brother|ly affection may be perpetual&mdash;that the free Con&s;titution, which is the work of your hands, may be &s;acredly main|tained&mdash;that its admini&s;tration in ever department may be &s;tamped with wi&s;dom and virtue&mdash;that, in fine, the happi|ne&s;s of the people of the&s;e States, under the au&s;pices of liber|ty, may be made complete, by &s;o careful a pre&s;ervation and &s;o prudent a u&s;e of this ble&s;&s;ing, as will acquire to them the glory of recommending it to the applau&s;e, the affection, and adoption of every nation which is yet a &s;tranger to it.</P>
<P>Here perhaps, I ought to &s;top. But &s;olicitude for your welfare, which cannot end but with my life, and the ap|prehen&s;ion, of danger natural to that &s;olicitude, urge me on an occa&s;ion like the pre&s;ent, to offer to your &s;olemn con|templation, and to recommend to your frequent review, &s;ome &s;entiments; which are the re&s;ult of much reflection of no incon&s;iderable ob&s;ervation, and which appear to me all-important to the permanency of your felicity as a people. The&s;e will be offered to you with the more freedom, as you can only feel in them the di&s;intere&s;ted warnings of a parting friend, who can po&s;&s;ibly have no per&s;onal motive to bias his coun&s;el. Nor can I forget, as an encouragement to it, your indulgent reception of my &s;entiments on a former and not di&s;&s;imilar occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your hearts, no recommendation of mine is nece&s;&s;ary to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">tify or confirm the attachment.</P>
<P>The unity of Government which con&s;titutes you one peo|ple, is al&s;o now dear to you. It is ju&s;tly &s;o; for it is a main pillar in the edifice of your real Independence, the &s;upport of your tranquility at home, your peace abroad; of your &s;afety; of your pro&s;perity; of that very liberty which you &s;o highly prize. But, as it is ea&s;y to fore&s;ee, that from different cau&s;es and from different quarters, much pains will be taken, many <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">, to weaken in your <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the conviction of this truth; as this is the point in your political <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, again&s;t which the batteries of in|ternal and external enemies will be mo&s;t con&s;tantly and ac|tively, (though often covertly and in&s;idiou&s;ly) directed, it is of infinite moment that you &s;hould properly e&s;timate the
<PB N="43" REF="037339_0042_100CEB1654F39238">
immen&s;e value of your National Union, to your collective and individual happine&s;s; that you &s;hould cheri&s;h a cordial, habitual, and immoveable attachment to it; accu&s;toming your&s;elves to think and &s;peak of it as of the palladium of your political &s;afety and pro&s;perity, watching for its pre&s;ervation with jealous anxiety; di&s;countenancing whatever may &s;ug|ge&s;t even a &s;u&s;picion that it can in any event be abandoned; and indignantly frowning upon the fir&s;t dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the re&s;t, or to enfeeble the &s;acred ties which now link together the various parts.</P>
<P>For this you have every inducement of &s;ympathy and in|tere&s;t. Citizens, by birth or choice, of a common country, that country has a right to concentrate your affections. The name of AMERICAN, which belongs to you in your national capacity, mu&s;t always exalt the ju&s;t pride of patri|oti&s;m, more than any appellation derived from local di&s;cri|minations. With &s;light &s;hades of difference, you have the &s;ame religion, manners, habits and political principles. You have in a common cau&s;e, fought and triumphed toge|ther; the Independence and Liberty you po&s;&s;e&s;s are the work of joint councils, and joint efforts, of common dan|gers, &s;ufferings and &s;ucce&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>But the&s;e con&s;iderations however powerfully they addre&s;s them&s;elves to your &s;en&s;ibility, are greatly outweighed by tho&s;e which apply more immediately to your intere&s;t. Here every portion of our country finds the mo&s;t commanding motives for carefully guarding and pre&s;erving the union of the whole.</P>
<P>The <HI>North,</HI> in an unre&s;trained intercour&s;e with the <HI>South,</HI> protected by the equal laws of a common government, finds in the productions of the latter, great additional re&s;ources of maritime and commercial enterpri&s;e, and precious mate|rials of manufacturing indu&s;try. The <HI>South</HI> in the &s;ame in|tercour&s;e, benefiting by the agency of the <HI>North,</HI> &s;ees its a|griculture grow, and its commerce expand. Turning part|ly into its own channels the &s;eamen of the <HI>North,</HI> it finds its particular navigation invigorated&mdash;and while it contributes, in different ways, to nouri&s;h and increa&s;e the general ma&s;s of the national navigation, it looks forward to the protection of a maritime &s;trength, to which it&s;elf is unequally adopted. The <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> in a like intercour&s;e with the <HI>We&s;t,</HI> already finds,
<PB N="44" REF="037339_0043_100CEB180FB57818">
and in the progre&s;&s;ive improvement of interior communica|tions, by land and water,&mdash;will more and more find a valuable vent for the commodities which it brings from a|broad, or manufactures at home. The <HI>We&s;t</HI> derives from the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> &s;upplies requi&s;ite to its growth and comfort&mdash;and what is perhaps of &s;till greater con&s;equence, it mu&s;t of ne|ce&s;&s;ity owe the <HI>&s;ecure</HI> enjoyment of indi&s;pen&s;able <HI>outlets</HI> for its own productions to the weight, influence, and the future maritime &s;trength of the Atlantic &s;ide of the Union, direct|ed by an indi&s;&s;oluble community of intere&s;t as <HI>one nation.</HI> Any other tenure by which the <HI>We&s;t</HI> can hold this e&s;&s;ential advantage, whether derived from its own &s;eparate &s;trength, or from an apo&s;tate and unnatural connection with any fo|reign power, mu&s;t be intrin&s;ically precarious.</P>
<P>While then every part of our country thus feels an im|mediate and particular intere&s;t in Union, all the parts combi|ned cannot fail to find in the united ma&s;s of means and ef|forts, greater &s;trength, greater re&s;ource, proportionably greater &s;ecurity, from external danger, a le&s;s frequent in|terruption of their peace by foreign nations; and what is of ine&s;timable value! they mu&s;t derive from Union an exemp|tion from tho&s;e broils and wars between them&s;elves, which &s;o frequently afflict neighbouring countries, not tied toge|ther by the &s;ame government; which their own rival&s;hips alone would be &s;ufficient to produce, but which oppo&s;ite fo|reign alliances, attachments and intrigues would &s;timulate and imbitter. Hence likewi&s;e they will avoid the nece&s;&s;ity of tho&s;e overgrown military e&s;tabli&s;hments, which under any form of government are inau&s;picious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as particularly ho&s;tile to Repub|lican Liberty: In this &s;en&s;e it is, that your Union ought to be con&s;idered as a main prop of your liberty, and that the love of the one ought to endear to you the pre&s;ervation of the other.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations &s;peak a per&s;ua&s;ive language to eve|ry reflecting and virtuous mind, and exhibit the continu|ance of the Union as a primary object of a patriotic de&s;ire. Is there a doubt, whether a common government can em|brace, &s;o large a &s;phere?&mdash;Let experience &s;olve it. To li&s;ten to mere &s;peculation in &s;uch a ca&s;e were criminal. We are authori&s;ed to hope that a proper organization, of the whole, with the auxiliary agency, of governments for the re&s;pective &s;ubdivi&s;ions, will afford a happy i&s;&s;ue to the
<PB N="45" REF="037339_0044_100CEB1A6EFF5F40">
experiment. 'Tis well worth a fair and full experiment. With &s;uch powerful and obvious motives to Union, affecting all parts of our country, while experiment &s;hall not have demon&s;trated its impracticability, there will always be rea|&s;on to di&s;tru&s;t the patrioti&s;m of tho&s;e, who in any quarter may endeavour to weaken its bands.</P>
<P>In contemplating the cau&s;es which may di&s;turb our Union, it occurs as matter of &s;erious concern, that any ground &s;hould be furni&s;hed for characteri&s;ing parties, by <HI>Geographical</HI> di&s;|criminations&mdash;<HI>Nothern</HI> and <HI>Southern&mdash;Atlantic</HI> and <HI>We&s;tern;</HI> whence de&s;igning men may endeavour to excite a belief, that there is a real difference of local intere&s;ts and views. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence, with|in particular di&s;tricts, is to mi&s;repre&s;ent the opinions and aims of other <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. You cannot &s;hield your&s;elves too much again&s;t the jealou&s;ies and heart burnings which &s;pring from the&s;e mi&s;repre&s;entations: they tend to render alien to each other tho&s;e who ought to be bound together by fra|ternal affection.&mdash;The inhabitants of our we&s;tern country have lately had a u&s;eful le&s;&s;on on this head: They have &s;een, in the negociation by the Executive, and in the una|nimous ratification by the Senate, of the Treaty with Spain, and in the univer&s;al &s;atisfaction at that event, throughout the United States, a deci&s;ive proof how unfounded were the &s;u&s;picions propagated among them, of a policy in the general government and in the Atlantic &s;tates unfriendly to their intere&s;ts in regard to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi; they have been witne&s;&s;es to the formation of two treaties, that with Great-Britain and that with Spain, which &s;ecure to them every thing they could de&s;ire, in re&s;pect to our foreign re|lations, towards confirming their pro&s;perity. Will it not be their wi&s;dom to rely for the pre&s;ervation of the&s;e ad|vantages on the UNION by which they were procured? Will they not henceforth be deaf to tho&s;e advi&s;ers, if &s;uch they are, who would fever them from their brethren, and connect them with aliens?</P>
<P>To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a go|vernment for the whole is indi&s;pen&s;able. No alliances, however &s;trict, between the parts can be an adequate &s;ub|&s;titute; they will inevitably experience the infractions and interruptions which all alliances in all times have experien|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">&mdash;Sen&s;ible of this momentous truth, you have improv|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay, by the adoption of a con&s;titution of

a government better calculated than your former for an intimate Union, and for the efficacious management of your common concerns. This government, the offspring of your own choice, uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full inve&s;tigation and mature deliberation, completely free in its principles, in the di&s;tribution of its powers, uniting &s;ecu|rity with energy, and containing within it&s;elf a provi&s;ion for its own amendment, has a ju&s;t claim to your confidence and your &s;upport. Re&s;pect for its authority, compliance with its laws, acquie&s;cence in its mea&s;ures, are duties en|joined by the fundamental maxims of true liberty. The ba&s;is of our political &s;y&s;tems is the right of the people to make and to alter their con&s;titutions of government. But, the con&s;titution which at any time exi&s;ts, till changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people, is &s;acred|ly obligatory upon all. The very idea of the power and the right of the people to e&s;tabli&s;h government, pre-&s;uppo|&s;es the duty of every individual to obey the e&s;tabli&s;hed go|vernment.</P>
<P>All ob&s;tructions to the execution of the laws, all combi|nations and a&s;&s;ociations, under whatever plau&s;ible charac|ter, with the real de&s;ign to direct, controul, counteract or awe the regular deliberation and action of the con&s;tituted authorities, are de&s;tructive of this fundamental principle, and of fatal tendency. They &s;erve to organize faction, to give it an artificial and extraordinary force&mdash;to put in the place of the delegated will of the nation, the will of a party, often a &s;mall but artful and enterpri&s;ing minority of the community; and, according to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make the public admini&s;tration the mir|ror of the ill concerted and incongruous projects of faction, rather than the organ of con&s;i&s;tent and whole&s;ome plans dige&s;ted by common councils and modified by mutual in|tere&s;ts.</P>
<P>However combinations of a&s;&s;ociations of the above de|&s;cription, may now and then an&s;wer popular ends, they are likely in the cour&s;e of time and things, to become potent engines, by which cunning, ambitious and unprincipled men, will be enabled to &s;ubvert the power of the people, and to u&s;urp for them&s;elves the reins of government; de|&s;troying afterwards the very engines which have lifed them to unju&s;t dominion.</P>
<P>Towards the pre&s;ervation of your government, and the
<PB N="47" REF="037339_0046_100CEB1E861D27B0">
permanency of your pre&s;ent happy &s;tate, it is requi&s;ite, not only that you &s;teadily di&s;countenance irregular oppo&s;ition to its acknowledged authority, but al&s;o that you re&s;i&s;t with care, the &s;pirit of innovation upon its principles, however &s;pecious the pretexts. One method of a&s;&s;ault may be to effect in the forms of the con&s;titution, alterations which will impair the energy of the &s;y&s;tem, and thus to undermine what cannot be directly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited, remember that time and ha|bit are at lea&s;t as nece&s;&s;ary to fix the true character of go|vernment, as of other human in&s;titutions that experience is the &s;ure&s;t &s;tandard, by which to te&s;t the real tendency of the exi&s;ting con&s;titution of a country&mdash;that facility in chan|ges upon the credit of mere hypothe&s;is and opinion, expo|&s;es to perpetual change, from the endle&s;s variety of hypo|the&s;is and opinion; and remember, e&s;pecially, that for the efficient management of your common intere&s;t, in a country &s;o exten&s;ive as ours, a government of as much vigor as is con&s;i&s;tent with the perfect &s;ecurity of liberty, is indi&s;pen&s;i|ble. Liberty it&s;elf will find in &s;uch a government, with powers properly di&s;tributed and adju&s;ted, its &s;ure&s;t guardi|an. It is, indeed, little el&s;e than a name, where the go|vernment is too feeble to with&s;tand the enterprises of faction, to confine each member of the &s;ociety within the limits pre|&s;cribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the &s;ecure and tranquil enjoyment of the rights of per&s;on and property.</P>
<P>I have already intimated to you, the danger of parties in the &s;tate, with particular reference to the founding of them on geographical di&s;criminations. Let me now take a more comprehen&s;ive view and warn you in the mo&s;t &s;olemn man|ner again&s;t the baneful effects of the &s;pirit of party, gene|rally.</P>
<P>This &s;pirit, unfortunately, is in&s;eparable from our na|ture, having its root in the &s;tronge&s;t pa&s;&s;ions of the human mind. It exi&s;ts under different &s;hapes in all governments &mdash;more or le&s;s &s;tifled, controled, or repre&s;&s;ed; but in tho&s;e of the popular form, it is &s;een in its greate&s;t rankne&s;s and is truly their wor&s;t enemy.</P>
<P>The alternate dominion of one faction over another, &s;har|pened by the &s;pirit of revenge, natural to party di&s;&s;ention, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the mo&s;t horrid enormities, is it&s;elf a frightful de&s;poti&s;m&mdash;But
<PB N="48" REF="037339_0047_100CEB20DC626738">
this leads at length to a more formal and permanent de&s;po|ti&s;m.&mdash;The di&s;orders and mi&s;eries, which re&s;ult, gradually incline the minds of men to &s;eek &s;ecurity, and repo&s;e in the ab&s;olute power of an individual; and &s;ooner or later the chief of &s;ome prevailing faction more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this di&s;po&s;ition to the purpo&s;es of his own elevation, on the ruins of Public Liberty.</P>
<P>Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind (which neverthele&s;s ought not to be entirely out of &s;ight) the common and continual mi&s;chiefs of the &s;pirit of party are &s;ufficient to make it the intere&s;t and duty of a wi&s;e people to di&s;courage and re&s;train it.</P>
<P>It &s;erves always to di&s;tract the Public Councils and enfee|ble the Public Admini&s;tration. It agitates the community With ill founded jealou&s;ies and fal&s;e alarms; kindles the animo&s;ity of one part again&s;t another, foments occa&s;ionally riot and in&s;urrection. It opens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which find a facilitated acce&s;s to the gov|ernment it&s;elf through the channels of party pa&s;&s;ions. Thus the policy and will of one country are &s;ubjected to the pol|icy and will of another.</P>
<P>There is an opinion that parties in free countries are u&s;e|ful checks upon the admini&s;tration of the government, and &s;erve to keep alive the &s;pirit of Liberty. This within cer|tain limits is probably true, and in governments of a monar|chical ca&s;t, patrioti&s;m may look with indulgence, if not with favour upon the &s;pirit of party. But in tho&s;e of the popular character, in governments purely elective, it is a &s;pirit not to be encouraged. From their natural tendency it is certain there will always be enough of that &s;pirit for every &s;alutary purpo&s;e. And there being con&s;tant danger of exce&s;s, the effort ought to be by force of Public opinion, to mitigate and a&s;&s;uage it. A fire not to be quenched; it demands uniform vigilance to prevent its bur&s;ting into a flame, lea&s;t in&s;tead of warming, it mould con&s;ume.</P>
<P>It is important likewi&s;e, that the habits of thinking in a free country, &s;hould in&s;pire caution, in tho&s;e entru&s;ted with its admini&s;tration, to confine them&s;elves within their re|&s;pective con&s;titutional &s;pheres, avoiding in the exerci&s;e of the powers of one department to encroach upon another. The &s;pirit of encroachment tends to con&s;olidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to create, whatever
<PB N="49" REF="037339_0048_100CEB2304473318">
the form of Government, a real de&s;poti&s;m. A ju&s;t e&s;timate of that love of power, and pronene&s;s to abu&s;e it, which predominates in the human heart is &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy us of the truth of this po&s;ition. The nece&s;&s;ity of reciprocal checks in the exerci&s;e of the political power; by dividing and di&s;tributing it into different depo&s;itories, and con&s;titu|ting each the guardian of the public weal again&s;t inva&s;ions by the others, has been evinced by experiments ancient and modern; &s;ome of them in our country and under our own eyes. To pre&s;erve them mu&s;t be as nece&s;&s;ary as to in&s;titute them. If, in the opinion of the people, the di&s;tribution or modification of the con&s;titutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be corrected by an amendment in the way, which the con&s;titution de&s;ignates&mdash;But let there be no change by u&s;urpation; for though this, in one in&s;tance, may be the in&s;trument of good, it is the cu&s;tomary weapon by which free governments are de&s;troyed&mdash;The precedent mu&s;t always greatly overbalance in permanent evil any par|tial or tran&s;ient benefit which the u&s;e can at any time yield.</P>
<P>Of all the di&s;po&s;itions and habits which lead to political pro&s;perity, Religion and Morality are indi&s;pen&s;able &s;up|ports. In vain would that Man claim the tribute of Patri|oti&s;m, who would labor to &s;ubvert the&s;e great pillars of hu|man happine&s;s, the&s;e firme&s;t props of the duties of men and Citizens. The mere Politician, equally with the pious man ought to re&s;pect and to cheri&s;h them.&mdash;A volume could not trace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it &s;imply be a&s;ked where is the &s;ecurity for property, for reputation, for life, if the &s;en&s;e of religious obligation de&s;ert the oaths which are the in&s;truments of inve&s;tigation in Courts of Ju&s;tice?&mdash;And let us with caution indulge the &s;uppo&s;ition, that morality can be maintained without Re|ligion. Whatever may be conceded of the influence of re|fined education on minds of peculiar &s;tructure; rea&s;on and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclu&s;ion of religious principle.</P>
<P>Tis &s;ub&s;tantially true, that virtue or morality is a nece&s;|&s;ary &s;pring of popular government. The rule indeed ex|tends with more or le&s;s force to every &s;pecies of free gov|ernment. Who that is a &s;incere Friend to it can look
<PB N="50" REF="037339_0049_100CEB24FB932CC8">
with indifference upon attempts to &s;hake the foundation of the Fabric?</P>
<P>Promote, then as an object of primary importance, in|&s;titutions for the general diffu&s;ion of knowledge. In pro|portion as the &s;tructure of a government gives force to public opinion, it is e&s;&s;ential that public opinion &s;hould be enlightened.</P>
<P>As a very important &s;ource of &s;trength and &s;ecurity, cheri&s;h public credit. One method of pre&s;erving it is to u&s;e it as &s;paringly as po&s;&s;ible; avoiding occa&s;ions of ex|pence by cultivating peace, but remembering al&s;o that timely di&s;bur&s;ements to prepare for dangers, frequently prevent much greater di&s;bur&s;ements to repel it: Avoiding likewi&s;e the accumulation of debt, not only by &s;hunning occa&s;ions of expence, but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to di&s;charge the debts which unavoidable wars may have occa&s;ioned, not ungenerou&s;ly throwing upon po&s;terity the burthen which we our&s;elves ought to bear. The execution of the&s;e maxims belongs to your repre|&s;entatives, but it is nece&s;&s;ary that public opinion &s;hould co-operate. To facilitate to them the performance of their duty, it is e&s;&s;ential that you &s;hould practically bear in mind that towards the payment of debts there mu&s;t be re|venue;&mdash;that to have revenue there mu&s;t be taxes&mdash;and none can be devi&s;ed which are not more or le&s;s inconveni|ent and unplea&s;ant&mdash;that the intrin&s;ic embarra&s;&s;ment in&s;e|parable from the &s;election of the proper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties)&mdash;ought to be a deci&s;ive mo|tive for a candid con&s;truction of the conduct of the govern|ment in making it, and for a &s;pirit of acquie&s;cence in the mea&s;ures for obtaining revenue which the public exigencies may at any time dictate.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erve good faith and ju&s;tice towards all nations; cul|tivate peace and harmony with all&mdash;Religion and Morali|ty enjoin this conduct; and can it be, that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be worthy of a free, enlight|ened, and (at no di&s;tant period) a great nation, to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a peo|ple always guided by an exalted ju&s;tice and benevolence. Who can doubt that in the cour&s;e of time and things, the fruits of &s;uch a plan would richly repay any temporary ad|vantages which might be lo&s;t by a &s;teady adherence to it? Can it be, that Providence has not connected the perma|nent
<PB N="51" REF="037339_0050_100CEB27676A4178">
felicity of a Nation with Virtue? The experiment, at lea&s;t, is recommended by every &s;entiment which enno|bles human nature.&mdash;Alas! is it rendered impo&s;&s;ible by its vices?</P>
<P>In the execution of &s;uch a plan, nothing is more e&s;&s;enti|al than that permanent, inveterate antipathies again&s;t par|ticular Nations, and pa&s;&s;ionate attachments for others &s;hould be excluded; and that in the place of them, ju&s;t and ami|cable feelings towards all &s;hould be cultivated. The Na|tion which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or an habitual fondne&s;s, is in &s;ome degree a &s;lave.&mdash;It is a &s;lave to its animo&s;ity or to its affection, either of which is &s;ufficient to lead it a&s;tray from its duty and its intere&s;t. Antipathy in one nation again&s;t another di&s;po&s;es each more readily to offer in&s;ult and injury, to lay hold of &s;light cau&s;|es of umbrage, and to be haughty and intractable, when ac|cidental or trifling occa&s;ions of di&s;pute occur.</P>
<P>Hence frequent colli&s;ions, ob&s;tinate, envenomed and bloody conte&s;ts. The Nation, prompted by ill will and re&s;entment, &s;ometimes impels to war the government, con|trary to the be&s;t calculations of policy. The government &s;ometimes participates in the national propen&s;ity, and a|dopts through pa&s;&s;ion what rea&s;on would reject; at other times, it makes the animo&s;ity of the nation &s;ub&s;ervient to projects of ho&s;tility in&s;tigated by pride, ambition, and other &s;ini&s;ter and pernicious motives. The peace often, &s;ome|times perhaps the liberty of Nations has been the victim.</P>
<P>So likewi&s;e, a pa&s;&s;ionate attachment of one Nation for another produces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favo|rite Nation, facilitating the illu&s;ion of an imaginary com|mon intere&s;t, in ca&s;es where no real common intere&s;t ex|i&s;ts, and infu&s;ing into one the enmities of the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels and wars of the latter, without adequate inducement or ju&s;tification. It leads al&s;o to conce&s;&s;ions to the favorite na|tion of privileges denied to others, which is apt doubly to injure the Nation making the conce&s;&s;ions; by unnece&s;&s;a|rily parting with what ought to have been retained; and by exciting jealou&s;y, ill will, and a di&s;po&s;ition to retaliate, in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld: &mdash;And it gives to ambitious, corrupted or deluded citizens (who devote them&s;elves to the favorite Nation) facility to betray, or &s;acrifice the intere&s;ts of their own country, with|out
<PB N="52" REF="037339_0051_100CEB28FB09F3E0">
odium, &s;ometimes even with popularity; gilding with the appearances of a virtuous &s;en&s;e of obligation a commen|dable deference for public opinion, or a laudable zeal for public good, the ba&s;e or fooli&s;h compliances of ambition, corruption, or infatuation.</P>
<P>As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, &s;uch attachments are particularly alarming to the truly en|lightened and independent patriot. How many opportuni|ties do they afford to tamper with dome&s;tic factions, to prac|tice the arts of &s;eduction to mi&s;lead public opinion, to in|fluence or awe the public councils; &s;uch an attachment of a &s;mall or weak, towards a great and powerful nation, dooms the former to be the &s;atellite of the latter.</P>
<P>Again&s;t the in&s;iduous wiles of foreign influence (I con|jure you to believe me, fellow citizens) the jealou&s;y of a free people ought to be <HI>con&s;tantly</HI> awake; &s;ince hi&s;tory and ex|perience prove that foreign influence is one of the mo&s;t baneful foes of Republican Government. But that jealou|&s;y to be u&s;eful mu&s;t be impartial; el&s;e it becomes the in|&s;trument of the very influence to be avoided, in&s;tead of a defence again&s;t it. Exce&s;&s;ive partiality for one foreign na|tion, and exce&s;&s;ive di&s;like of another, cau&s;e tho&s;e whom they actuate to &s;ee danger only on one &s;ide, and &s;erve to veil and even &s;econd the arts of influence on the other. Real patriots, who may re&s;i&s;t the intrigues of the favorite, are liable to become &s;u&s;pected and odious; while its tools and dupes u&s;urp the applau&s;e and confidence of the people to &s;urrender their intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations, is in extending our commercial relations, to have with them as little <HI>political</HI> connection as po&s;&s;ible. So far as we have already formed engagements, let them be ful|filled with perfect good faith.&mdash;Here let us &s;top.</P>
<P><HI>Europe</HI> has a &s;et of primary intere&s;ts, which to us have none, or a very remote relation. Hence &s;he mu&s;t be en|gaged in frequent controver&s;ies, the cau&s;es of which are e&s;&s;entially foreign to our concerns. Hence therefore, it mu&s;t be unwi&s;e in us to implicate our&s;elves, by artificial <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">es, in the ordinary vici&s;itudes of her politics, or the ordi|nary combinations and colli&s;ions of her friend&s;hips, or en|mities.</P>
<P>Our detached and di&s;tant &s;ituation, invites and enables us
<PB N="53" REF="037339_0052_100CEB2AF38FF768">
to pur&s;ue a different cour&s;e. If we remain one people, un|der an efficient government, the period is not far off, when we may defy material injury from external annoyance; when we may take &s;uch an attitude as will cau&s;e the neu|trality, we may at any time re&s;olve upon, to be &s;crupulou&s;|ly re&s;pected; when belligerent nations, under the impo&s;|&s;ibility of making acqui&s;itions upon us, will not lightly ha|zard the giving us provocation; when we may choo&s;e peace or war, as our intere&s;t, guided by ju&s;tice, &s;hall coun&s;el.</P>
<P>Why forego the advantages of &s;o peculiar a &s;ituation? Why quit our own, to &s;tand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our de&s;tiny with that of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and pro&s;perity in the toils of Europe|an ambition, rival&s;hip, intere&s;t, humour or caprice?</P>
<P>'Tis our true policy to &s;teer clear of permanent alliances, with any portion of the foreign world; &s;o far, I mean, as we are <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> liberty to do it; for let me not, be under|&s;tood as <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">able of patronizing infidelity to exi&s;ting engage|ments. I hold the maxim no le&s;s applicable to public than to private affairs, that hone&s;ty is always the be&s;t policy. I repeat it, therefore, let tho&s;e engagements be ob&s;erved in their genuine &s;en&s;e. But in my opinion, it is unnece&s;&s;ary, and would be unwi&s;e to extend them.</P>
<P>Taking care always to keep our&s;elves, by &s;uitable e&s;tab|li&s;hments, on a re&s;pectable defen&s;ive po&s;ture, we may &s;afe|ly tru&s;t to temporary alliances for extraordinary emer|gencies.</P>
<P>Harmony, liberal intercour&s;e with all nations, are re|commended by policy, humanity and intere&s;t. But even our commercial policy, &s;hould hold an equal and impartial hand; neither &s;ending or granting exclu&s;ive favours or preferences&mdash;con&s;ulting the natural cour&s;e of things; dif|fu&s;ing and diver&s;ifying by gentle means the &s;treams of com|merce, but forcing nothing; e&s;tabli&s;hing, with powers &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, in order to give trade a &s;table cour&s;e to define the rights of our merchants, and to enable the Government to &s;upport them; conventional rules of intercour&s;e, the be&s;t that pre&s;ent circum&s;tances and mutual opinion will permit, but temporary, and liable to be from time to time abandon|ed or varied as experience and circum&s;tances &s;hall dictate; con&s;tantly keeping in view, that 'tis folly in one nation to look for di&s;intere&s;ted favours from another; that it mu&s;t
<PB N="54" REF="037339_0053_100CEB2CEE134DA8">
pay with a portion of its Independence for whatever it may accept under that character; that by &s;uch acceptance, it may place it&s;elf in the condition of having given equivalents for nominal favours, and yet of being reproached with in|gratitude for not giving more.&mdash;There can be no greater error than to expect, or calculate, upon <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">eal favours from nation to nation. 'Tis an illu&s;ion which experience mu&s;t cure, which a ju&s;t pride ought to di&s;card.</P>
<P>In offering to you, my countrymen, the&s;e coun&s;els of an old affectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the &s;trong and la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion I could wi&s;h&mdash;that they will controul the u&s;ual current of the pa&s;&s;ions, or prevent our nation from running the cour&s;e which has hitherto marked the de&s;tiny of nations: But if I may even flatter my&s;elf, that they may be productive of &s;ome partial benefit, &s;ome occa&s;ional good; that they may now and then recur to moderate the fury of party &s;pirit, to warn again&s;t the mi&s;|chiefs of foreign intrigue, to guard again&s;t the impo&s;tures of pretended patrioti&s;m; this hope will be a full recompence for the &s;olicitude for your welfare, by which they have been dictated.</P>
<P>How far in the di&s;charge of my official duties, I have been guided by the principles which have been delineated, the public records and other evidences of my conduct mu&s;t witne&s;s to you and to the world. To my&s;elf, the a&s;&s;urance of my own con&s;cience is, that I have at lea&s;t believed my|&s;elf to be guided by them.</P>
<P>In relation to the &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting war in Europe, my Pro|clamation of the 22d of April, 1795, is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your approving voice, and by that of your Repre&s;entatives in both Hou&s;es of Congre&s;s, the &s;pirit of that mea&s;ure has continually governed me; unin|fluenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.</P>
<P>After deliberate examination, with the aid of the be&s;t lights I could obtain, I was well &s;ati&s;fied that our country, under all the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, had a right to take and was bound in duty and intere&s;t to take a neutral po&s;i|tion. Having taken it, I determined, as far as &s;hould de|pend on me, to maintain it, with moderation.</P>
<P>The con&s;iderations which re&s;pect the right to hold this conduct, it is not nece&s;&s;ary on this occa&s;ion to detail. I will only ob&s;erve, that according to my under&s;tanding of the
<PB N="55" REF="037339_0054_100CEB2F037C1AE8">
matter, that right, &s;o far from being denied by any of the Belligerent Powers, has been virtually admitted by all.</P>
<P>The duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred, without any thing more, from the obligation which ju&s;tice and humanity impo&s;e on every nation, in ca&s;es in which it is free to act, to maintain inviolate the relations of peace and amity towards other nations.</P>
<P>The inducements of intere&s;t for ob&s;erving that conduct will be&s;t be referred to your own reflections and experi|ence. With me, a predominant motive has been to endea|vour to gain time to our country to &s;ettle and mature its yet recent in&s;titutions, and to progre&s;s without interruption, to that degree of &s;trength and con&s;i&s;tency, which is nece&s;&s;ary to give it, humanly &s;peaking, the command of its own for|tunes.</P>
<P>Though in reviewing the incidents of my admini&s;trati|on, I am uncon&s;cious of intentional error: I am neverthe|le&s;s too &s;en&s;ible of my defects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. Whatever they may be, I fervently be&s;eech the Almighty to avert or mitigate the evils, to which they may tend. I &s;hall al&s;o carry with me the hope that my country will never cea&s;e to view them with indulgence; and that after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its &s;ervice, with an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be con&s;igned to oblivion, as my|&s;elf mu&s;t &s;oon be the man&s;ions of re&s;t.</P>
<P>Relying on its kindne&s;s in this as in other things, and ac|tuated by that fervent love towards it, which is &s;o natural to a man who views in it the native &s;oil of him&s;elf and his progenitors for &s;everal generations; I anticipate with plea|&s;ing expectation that retreat, in which I promi&s;e my&s;elf to realize, without alloy, the &s;weet enjoyment of partaking, in the mid&s;t of my fellow-citizens, the benign influence of good laws under a free government&mdash;the ever favorite object of my heart, and the happy reward as I tru&s;t, of our mutual cares, labours and dangers.</P>
