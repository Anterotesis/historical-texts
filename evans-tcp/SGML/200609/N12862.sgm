<HEAD>A NARRATIVE OF THE CAPTUTE and TREATMENT OF JOHN DODGE, By the ENGLISH at DETROIT.</HEAD>
<P>_I Some time &s;ince left the place of my na|tivity in Connecticut, and, in the year 1770, &s;ettled in Sandu&s;ky, an Indian village, about half way between Pit&s;burg and Detroit, where I carried on a very beneficial trade with the na|tives, till the unhappy Di&s;pute between Great-Bri|tain and America reached tho&s;e pathle&s;s wilds, and rou&s;ed to war Savages no ways intere&s;ted in it.</P>
<P>In July, 1775, Captain James Woods called at my hou&s;e in his way to the different Indian towns, where he was going to invite them, in the name of the Con|gre&s;s, to a treaty to be held at Fort Pitt the en&s;uing fall; I attended him to their villages, and the Savages promi&s;ed him they would be there. Capt Woods al&s;o invited me to go with the Indians to the treaty, as they were in want of an interpreter, which I readily agreed to.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="016262_0003_0F9BD0FBC489C610">Soon after the departure of Capt. Woods, the com|mander of Fort Detroit &s;ent for the Savages in and about Sandu&s;ky, and told them that he heard they were invited by the Americans to a treaty at Pitt&s;burg, which they told him was true; on which he delivered them a talk to the following purport: "That he was their father, and as &s;uch he would advi&s;e them as his own children; that the Coloni&s;ts who were to meet them at Pitt&s;burgh were a bad people, that by the in|dulgence of their Protector, they had grown a nume|rous and &s;aucy people; that the great King nor think|ing they would have the a&s;&s;urance to oppo&s;e his ju<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> laws, had kept but few troops in America for &s;ome years pa&s;t; that tho&s;e men being ignorant of their in capacity to go through with what they intend, pro|po&s;e to cut off the few regulars in this country, and then you indians, and have all America to them&s;elves; and all they want is, under the &s;hew of friend&s;hip, to get you into their hands as ho&s;tages, and there hold you, till your nations &s;hall comply with their terms, which if they refu&s;e, you will be all ma&s;&s;acred. There|fore do not go by any means; but if you will join me, and keep them at bay a little while, the King, our fa|ther, will &s;end large fleets and armies to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and we will &s;oon &s;ubdue them, and have their planta|tions to our&s;elves.</P>
<P>This talk &s;o di&s;mayed the Indians, that they came to me and &s;aid they would not go to the treaty, at the &s;ame time telling me what the Governor of Detroit had &s;aid to them On this Mr. James Heron and my|&s;elf, having the cau&s;e of our country at heart, a&s;&s;erted that what the Governor had &s;aid was fal&s;e, and told them that the Coloni&s;ts would not hurt a hair of their heads, and if they would go to the treaty, that I, with Mr. Heron, would be &s;ecurity, and pledge our proper|ty, to the amount of 4000 l. for their &s;afe return. This,
<PB N="7" REF="016262_0004_0F9BD0FBDE251250">
with the arrival of Mr. Richard Butler with fre&s;h invi|tations, induced &s;ome of them to go with me to the treaty.</P>
<P>In the fall I attended a number of them to the trea|ty, where we were politely received by the Commi&s;&s;i|oners &s;ent by Congre&s;s. The council commenced; the Indians, who are always fond of fi&s;hing in troubled water, offered their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which was refu&s;ed, with a reque&s;t that they would remain in peace, and not take up the hatchet on either &s;ide. On the whole, the&s;e In|dians were well plea&s;ed with the talk from the Con|gre&s;s, and promi&s;ed to remain quiet.</P>
<P>The Commi&s;&s;ioners thinking it proper, &s;ent the con|tinental belt and talk by &s;ome of the Chiefs to the Sa|vages who re&s;ided about the lakes. The&s;e Chiefs be|ing obliged to pa&s;s Sandu&s;ky in their rout, Mr. John Gib&s;on, Agent for Indian affairs, reque&s;ted me to ac|company them, and furni&s;h them with what they &s;tood in need of; on which I took them home.</P>
<P>On my arrival at the village I found the &s;avages in confu&s;ion, and preparing for war, on which I called a council and rehear&s;ed the Continental talk, which, with a pre&s;ent of goods to the amount of twenty-five pounds, quieted them. This I informed Congre&s;s of&punc; agree|able to their reque&s;t, by expre&s;s, and that the Gover|nor of Detroit was &s;till urging the Indians to war.</P>
<P>Soon after this, a party of Savages from the neigh|bourhood of the lakes, came to my hou&s;e on their way to the frontiers to &s;trike a blow; I a&s;ked them the rea|&s;on they took up the hatchet; they replied, that the Governor of Detroit had told them, that the Americans were going to murder them all and take their lands; but if they would join him, they would be able to drive them off, and that he would give them twenty dollars a &s;calp. On this I rehear&s;ed the Continental talk, and making them a &s;mall pre&s;ent they returned home, be|lieving
<PB N="8" REF="016262_0005_0F9BD0FCF9F2C720">
as I had told them, that the Governor was a liar and meant to deceive them.</P>
<P>On this I thought proper to write the Governor of Detroit, what he was to expect &s;hould he continue to per&s;uade the Indians to take up the hatchet. He was &s;o enraged at the receipt of this letter, that he offered 100l. for my &s;calp or body; he &s;ent out &s;everal parties to take me without effect, till having &s;pread an evil report of me among the Indians, on the 15th of Jan. 1776, my hou&s;e was &s;urrounded by about 20 &s;oldiers and &s;avages, who broke into the hou&s;e, made me a pri&s;oner, and then marched me for Detroit.</P>
<P>It was about the du&s;k of the evening when, after a fatiguing march, I arrived at Detroit, and was car|ried before Henry Hamilton, late a captain in the 15th regt. but now Governor and Commandant of Detroit; he ordered me to clo&s;e confinement, telling me to &s;pend that night in making my peace with God, as it was the la&s;t night I &s;hould live; I was then hurried to a loath&s;ome dungeon, ironed and thrown in with three cri|minals, being allowed neither bedding, &s;traw, or fire, although it was in the depth of Winter, and &s;o exceed|ing cold, that my toes were froze before morning.</P>
<P>About 10 o'clock the next morning, I was taken out and carried before the Governor, who produced a num|ber of letters with my name &s;igned to them, and a&s;ked me if they were my hand writing? to which I re|plied, they were not; he then &s;aid, it was a matter of indifference to him whether I owned it or not, as he under&s;tood that I had been carrying on a corre&s;pon|dence with Congre&s;s, taking the Savages to their treaties, and preventing their taking up the hatchet in favour of his maje&s;ty, to defend his crown and dignity; that I was a rebel and traitor, and he would hang me. I a&s;ked him whether he intended to try me by the civil or military law, or give me any trial at all? to
<PB N="9" REF="016262_0006_0F9BD0FD4B2F9A08">
which he replied, that he was not obliged to give any damn'd a rebel trial unle&s;s he thought proper, that he would hang every one he caught, and that he would begin with me fir&s;t. I told him if he took my life, to beware of the con&s;equence, as he might depend on it that it would be looked into. What, &s;ays he, do you threaten me you damn'd rebel, I will &s;oon alter your tone, here take the damn'd rebel to the dungeon again, and let him pray to God to have mercy on his &s;oul, for I will &s;oon fix his body between heaven and earth, and every &s;coundrel like him.</P>
<P>I was then re-delivered to the hands of Philip De Jeane, who acted in the capacity of judge, &s;heriff, and jailor, and carried back to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> dungeon, where I was &s;oon waited on by the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to read prayers with me; but it was &s;o extreem<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, he could not &s;tand it but a few minutes at a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. In conver&s;ation with him, I told him I thought it was very hard to loo&s;e my life without a trial, as I was innocent of the charge a|ledged again&s;t me; he &s;aid it was very true, but that the Governor had charged him not to give me the lea&s;t hopes of life, as he would ab&s;olutely hang me.</P>
<P>I remained in this di&s;mal &s;ituation three days, when De Jeane came and took out one of the criminals who were in the dungeon with me, and held a &s;hort con|ference with him, then came and told me, the govenor had &s;ent him to tell me to prepare for another world, as I had not long to live, and then withdrew. I en|quired of the criminal, who was a Frenchman, what De Jeane wanted with him, but he would not tell me.</P>
<P>The evening following he told his brother in di&s;tre&s;s, that De Jeane had offered him 20l. to hang Mr. Dodge (meaning me) but that he had refu&s;ed unle&s;s he had his liberty; De Jeane then &s;aid, that we &s;hould both be &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ot under the gallows.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="016262_0007_0F9BD0FE0BF5AD10">Being at la&s;t drove almo&s;t to de&s;pair, I told De Jeane to inform the Governor I was readier to die at that time than I &s;hould ever be, and that I would much rather undergo his &s;entence, than be tortured in the dreadful manner I then was; he returned for an&s;wer, that I need not hurry them, but prepare my&s;elf, as I &s;hould not know my time till half an hour before I was turned off.</P>
<P>Thus did I langui&s;h on in my dungeon, without a friend being allowed to vi&s;it me, denied the nece&s;&s;aries of life, and mu&s;t have peri&s;hed with the cold, it being in the depth of Winter, had not my fellow pri&s;oners &s;pared me a blanket from their &s;canty &s;tock. Thus de|nied the lea&s;t comfort in life, together with the unju&s;t and &s;avage threatning I received every day, brought me &s;o very low, that my inability to an&s;wer De Jeane's unrea&s;onable que&s;tions, with which he daily tormented me re&s;pecting innocent men, obliged him to notice my &s;ituation, and no doubt thinking I &s;hould die in their hands, they thought proper to remove me to the bar|racks, and ordered a Doctor to attend me. The wea|ther had been &s;o extreem cold, and my legs had been bolted in &s;uch a manner, that they were &s;o benumbed and the &s;inews contracted, that I had not the lea&s;t u&s;e of them; and the &s;everity of my u&s;age had brought on a fever, which had nigh &s;aved them any further troubel.</P>
<P>After I had lain &s;ome time ill, and my recovery was di&s;paired of, De Jeane called and told me that the Governor had altered his mind with re&s;pect to executing me, and bid me be of good cheer, as he believed the Governor would give me my liberty when I got better; I replied, that it was a matter of indifference to me whether he gave me my liberty or not, as I had much rather die than remain at their mercy; on which, he &s;aid, 'You may die and be damn'd', and bounced out of the room.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="016262_0008_0F9BD0FECB221900">When <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o far recovered as to be able to &s;it up in my bed, my <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> being afraid I &s;hould inform her hu&s;|band of her tricks in his ab&s;ence, told the Govenor that I was going <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> make my e&s;cape with a party of &s;oldiers, that I was well and could walk as well as &s;he could; tho' at that time my legs were &s;till &s;o cramped and benumbed with the irons and cold, that had king|doms been at &s;take, I could not walk.</P>
<P>On this information, De Jeane came and told me to get up and walk to the dungeon, from whence I came; I told him I was unable, <Q>Crawl then, you damn'd rebel, or I will make you</Q>; I told him he might do as he plea&s;ed, but I could not &s;tand, much more walks on this he called a party of &s;oldiers, who to&s;&s;ed me into a cart and carried me to the Dungeon: here, by the per&s;uation of the Doctor, who was very kind and at|tentive, I was allowed a bed and not ironed. By his care and the weather growing milder, I got rid of my fever and began to walk about my dungeon, which was only eight feet &s;quare; but even this was a plea|&s;ure too great for me to enjoy long, for in a few days was put into irons. The weather now growing warm and the place offen&s;ive, from the filth of the poor fel|lows I had left there, and who were afterwards exe|cuted, I relap&s;ed. By per&s;uation of the Doctor, who told them unle&s;s I had air I &s;hould die, a hole, about &s;even inches &s;quare, was cut to let in &s;ome air.</P>
<P>I remained ill till June, altho' the Doctor had done all that lay in his power; he then let the Governor know, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to recover unle&s;s I was removed from the dungeon, on which he &s;ent De Jeane to inform me, if I would give &s;ecurity for my good behaviour, that he would let me out of pri&s;on. Being, by my u&s;age and fever, reduced to a &s;tate of de&s;pondence, I told him that it was a matter of indiffe|rence what he did with me, and that his ab&s;ence was bet+ter

than his company: he then publi&s;hed <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> and &s;everal gentlemen voluntarily entered <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">00 l. &s;e|curity for me, and I once more was allowed to breath the fre&s;h air, after &s;ix months confinement in a loath|&s;ome dungeon, except eight or nine weeks that I lay &s;ick at the barracks.</P>
<P>ON my going abroad, I learned that all the property I left in the woods, to the amount of 15 or 1600 l. was taken in the King's name, and divided among the Indians. As I had but little to attend to but the recovery of my health, I mended apace. As &s;oon as I could walk abroad, Gov. Hamilton &s;ent for me and &s;aid, he was &s;orry for my misfortunes, and hoped I would think as little as po&s;&s;ible of them; that as I was in a low &s;tate, he thought I had be&s;t not think of bu&s;i|ne&s;s, or think of what I had left, as he would lend me a hand to recover my lo&s;&s;es. This &s;mooth di&s;|cour&s;e gave me but little &s;atisfaction for the ill u&s;age I had received at his hands; however, I was determined to re&s;t as ea&s;y as I could, till I had an opportunity of obtaining redre&s;s.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I found my&s;elf &s;o far recovered as to be able to do bu&s;ine&s;s, which was in September, I applied to the Governor to go down the country, but he put me off with fine words, a permi&s;&s;ion to do bu&s;ine&s;s there, and a promi&s;e of his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I now &s;ettled my accounts with the per&s;ons with whom I was con|nected in trade, and found my&s;elf 700 l. in debt. My credit being pretty good, I &s;et up a retail &s;tore, and as many of the inhabitants pitied my ca&s;e, they all &s;eemed willing to &s;pend their money with me. My being ma&s;ter of the different Indian languges, about De|troit was al&s;o of &s;ervice to me, &s;o that in a &s;hort time I paid off all my debts, and began to add to my &s;tock.</P>
<P>In the &s;pring of 1777, I heard there was like to be a good trade at Machilimakanac, on which I applied
<PB N="13" REF="016262_0010_0F9BD100696555F8">
to the Governor, and, with a great deal of trouble, got a pa&s;s, went, and met with good trade. On my return Gov. Hamilton, by &s;everal low arts, attempted to <HI>pick</HI> my cargo, which as it would &s;poil the &s;ale of the remainder, I could not allow. As he had no pre|tence for taking them from me by force, it once more provoked him to wrath again&s;t me; he greatly retard|ed my &s;ales by denying me a permit to draw my pow|der out of the magazine; al&s;o ordered my&s;elf and two &s;ervants to be ready at a moment's warning to march under Capt. Le Mote on a &s;couting party with Savages: I told him it was again&s;t my inclination to take up arms again&s;t my own fle&s;h and blood, and much more &s;o to go with Savages to butcher and &s;calp defencele&s;s women and children, that were not intere&s;ted in the pre&s;ent di&s;pute: He &s;aid it was not any of my bu&s;ine&s;s whether they were intere&s;ted in the di&s;pute or not; and added if you are not ready when called for, I will fix you. Lucky for me he was &s;oon after called down the country, and &s;ucceeded by Capt. Mount-pre&s;ent as commander, who ordered Le Mote to &s;trike my name out of his books; but my &s;ervants with their pay, I lo&s;t entirely.</P>
<P>The party of Savages under Le Mote went out with orders not to &s;pare man, woman, or child. To this cruel mandate even &s;ome of the Savages made an ob|jection, re&s;pecting the butchering the women and chil|dren, but they were told the children would make &s;ol|diers, and the women would keep up the &s;tock.&mdash; Tho&s;e &s;ons of Britain offered no reward for Pri&s;oners, but they gave the Indians twenty dollars a &s;calp, by which means they induced the Savages to make the poor inhabitants, who they had torn from their peaceable homes, carry their baggage till within a &s;hort di&s;tance of the fort, where, in cold blood, they murdered them, and delivered their green &s;calps in a
<PB N="14" REF="016262_0011_0F9BD102DBB4F4E0">
few hours after to tho&s;e Briti&s;h barbarians, who, on the fir&s;t yell of the Savages, flew to meet and hug them to their brea&s;ts reeking with the blood of inno|cence, and &s;hewed them every mark of joy and appro|bation, by firing of cannon, &amp;c.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e parties returning with a number of women and children's &s;calps, and three pri&s;oners, they were met by the Commander of the fort, and after the u&s;ual demon&s;trations of joy, delivered their &s;calps, for which they were paid; the Indians then made the Commandant a pre&s;ent of two of the pri&s;oners, re&s;erv|ing the third as a &s;acrifice to the manes of one of them that had fell in the expedition. Being &s;hocked at the idea of one of my fellow creatures being tortured and burnt alive by tho&s;e inhuman Savages, I &s;ought out the Indian who had lo&s;t his relative, and to whom, according to the Indian cu&s;tom, this unhappy man belonged; I found him, took him home with me, and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome of my friends, and twenty-five pounds worth of goods, I per&s;uaded the inhuman wretch to &s;ell his life to me. As the re&s;t of the gang had taken the pri&s;oner about two leagues di&s;|tance, and were making merry over him, we were obliged to lay a &s;cheme to deliver him from their hands, which we did in the following manner,&mdash;It being midnight and very dark, the Indian, my&s;elf, and two &s;ervants, cro&s;&s;ed the river in a batteaux to where they were carou&s;ing around this unhappy vic|tim. The Indian then went to his companions, and under pretence of taking the pri&s;oner out to an&s;wer a call of nature, he delivered him to me who lay at &s;ome di&s;|tance, and I carried him to the batteaux. As &s;oon as he found him&s;elf in the hands of his deliverer, his tran&s;port was too great for his tender frame; three dif|ferent times he &s;unk lifele&s;s in my arms, and as often, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the help of water, the only remedy at hand, I pre|vented
<PB N="15" REF="016262_0012_0F9BD1034E8383E0">
his going to the land of &s;pirits in a tran<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="7 letters"> joy. None but tho&s;e who have experienced it, can have an idea of the thoughts that mu&s;t have agitated the brea&s;t of a man, who but a few minutes before &s;aw him&s;elf &s;urrounded by Savages, who&s;e di&s;mal yell, and frightful figures, heightened by the glare of a large fire in a di&s;mal wood, which mu&s;t have harrowed up the &s;oul of an unintere&s;ted by&s;tander, much more of one who knew that very fire was prepared for his execu|tion, and that every moment the executioner was ex|pected to arrive.&mdash;The executioner arrives; he advan|ces towards him; he loo&s;ens this unhappy victim from the tree to which he was bound, no doubt, as this young man imagined, to be led to the &s;take; but as it were in an in&s;tant, he finds him&s;elf in the hands of his deliverer and fellow-countryman. This, as I &s;aid before, was too much for him to bear; however I got his almo&s;t lifele&s;s corp&s;e to my hou&s;e, where I kept him hid. The Indian, according to our agreement, in an hour or two after I was gone, returned &s;eemingly much fatigued, and told his fellow Savages, who were impatiently waiting to begin their brutal &s;acrifice, that the pri&s;oner had e&s;caped, and that he had in vain pur&s;ued him.</P>
<P>Some time after this I found an opportunity, and made an agreement with the Captain of a ve&s;&s;el going to Michilimakanac, to take my unhappy inmate with him, but one of my &s;ervants being tempted, by a large reward that was offered for retaking the above pri|&s;oner, informed De Jeane that he was hid in my hou&s;e, on which my habitation was &s;oon &s;urrounded by a part|ty of &s;oldiers under the command of &s;aid De Jeane, and my&s;elf, the young man and four &s;ervants were made pri&s;oners, and having demanded my keys, which I delivered, we were hurried to goal and confined in dif|ferent rooms. Here this unhappy young fellow, in
<PB N="16" REF="016262_0013_0F9BD108F36A3F28">
high expectations of &s;eeing his friends, was once more plunged into the horrors of impri&s;onment.</P>
<P>I was &s;ent for and carried before the Commandant, where, on being examined who was the per&s;on in my hou&s;e, I frankly told him it was a young man whom I had bought of the Indians when they were going to burn him, and that I meant to &s;end him to Canada to be out of the way of the Savages, but De Jeane, like other men of bad principles, thinking no man could do a good action without &s;ini&s;ter views, &s;aid that he believed I had purcha&s;ed him to &s;erve my own ends, and that he would find them out, which the Com|mandant ordered him to do as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and I was ordered to pri&s;on.</P>
<P>De Jeane then took my &s;ervant, who was his in|formant, ironed him, put him in the dungeon, and, after keeping him three days on bread and water, the lad almo&s;t frightened out of his &s;en&s;es, &s;ent for De Jeane, and told him that the day before I was taken up I had wrote &s;everal letters, and, on his bringing a candle to &s;eal them, that I &s;aid, if he told any one that I was writing to Pit&s;burg, that I would blow his brains out. This &s;uiting De Jeane's purpo&s;e, he made the lad &s;wear to it, and then &s;et him, with the re&s;t of my &s;ervants, at liberty.</P>
<P>I was now once more called before the Commandant, who told me he under&s;tood that I was going to &s;end an expre&s;s to his Maje&s;ty's enemies, in con&s;equence o which he had taken an inventory of my effects, and meant to &s;end me to Canada. I told him he was cer|tainly mi&s;informed, he then taxed me with what De Jean had forced from my &s;ervant; a&s;ked me where I was writing the day before I was taken. I told him to my corre&s;pondents in Montreal; and luckily for me a neighbour of mine, having been at my hou&s;e, was produced, who declared the truth of what I &s;aid, and

that, I being hurried, had given him the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> carry on board the ve&s;&s;el: This, with &s;ome other fa<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> accu&s;ations, being cleared up, I was once more re|lea&s;ed on giving fre&s;h &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>Though my&s;elf and &s;ervants were, for want of a pre|tence for detailing us, &s;et at liberty, it was not &s;o with the unfortunate young man whom I had purcha&s;ed from the Indian; he &s;till remained in pri&s;on, daily tormented with the threats of De Jeane, that he would deliver him to the Indians, which &s;o preyed on his &s;pirits, that in a &s;hort time it threw him into a fe|ver. I then applied to Captain Montpre&s;ent, the Com|mandant, who gave me permi&s;&s;ion, and I removed him to &s;ick Quarters, where I hired Jacob Pue, of Virgi|nia, his fellow pri&s;oner, to attend him: I al&s;o, when lei&s;ure would permit, attended him my&s;elf; but De Jeane, who &s;till haunted him, had &s;o great an effect on him, that one day when I vi&s;ited him, he called me to his bed &s;ide and &s;aid to me, that De Jeane had ju&s;t left him, that he told him to make ha&s;t and get well, as the Indians were waiting for him.&mdash;Pray, Sir, (&s;aid the young man to De Jeane) for God's &s;ake try to keep me from the Indians, for if they get me they will burn me. Keep you from them, &s;aid De Jeane, you damn'd Rebel you de&s;erve to be burned, and all your damned countrymen with you, &s;o you need not think Dodge can &s;ave you; General Hamilton is now come up, and he will fix you all. I tried to comfort him, and told him to be of good courage;&mdash; Oh! replied he, I am almo&s;t di&s;tracted with the idea of being burnt by the Savages; I had much rather die where I am, than be delivered into the hands of tho&s;e horrid wretches, from whom I &s;o lately, by your hands, e&s;caped, the recol|lection of which, makes me &s;hudder with horror. He could &s;ay no more; he &s;ank under it, and in a few hours after death, more kind than his cruel tormenters,
<PB N="18" REF="016262_0015_0F9BD10AC8CB4C08">
relea&s;ed him from his troubles. I paid the la&s;t tribute to this my unhappy countryman, and had his corp&s;e decently interred, attended by the Mi&s;&s;ionary and mo&s;t of the principal Merchants of the town.</P>
<P>As Hamilton was arrived, I had every thing to ex|pect that his malice could invent, more e&s;pecially as De Jeane, to whom his ear was always open, had told him (as I was informed) all and more than what had happened during his ab&s;ence. About a month after the death of the unhappy young man above related, I had occa&s;ion for &s;ome of my powder out of the Maga|zine; I wrote an order to the conductor, according to cu&s;tom, and waited on the Governor to have it &s;igned; on pre&s;enting it to him, he looked at it, and then look|ing at me with a &s;arca&s;tic &s;mile, &s;aid. It is powder you want, you damn'd ra&s;cal, is it? at the &s;ame time tearing my order and throwing it in my face; you have behaved your&s;elf very well, have you not? after my granting you your life, you would not go with La Mote, would you not? &s;ays he, and &s;tarting up in a great pa&s;&s;ion, as though he would &s;trike me, put him&s;elf be|tween me and the door. What, &s;ays he, you have a damn'd deal of influence with the Indians; you can purcha&s;e pri&s;oners without my approbation, can you? you damned ra&s;cal. Sir, &s;ays I, I am no ra&s;cal; not a word out of your mouth, &s;ays Hamilton, go about your bu&s;ine&s;s and take care of me or I will fix you: I replied, it had always been my &s;tudy to take care of him; not a word, &s;ays he, go about your bu&s;ine&s;s, and ble&s;s your &s;tars I was not here in&s;tead of Captain Montpre|&s;ent, for I would have fixed you, you damned &s;cound|rel. Here I took my leave, went home, and deter|mined to think as little of Mr. Hamilton and his u|&s;age as po&s;&s;ible, till I had an opportunity of getting redre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="016262_0016_0F9BD10B86672900">Notwith&s;tanding the hatred of Hamilton and De Jeane, I &s;pent the forepart of the Winter very happily, till the 25th of January, 1778, when &s;everal of the Merchants of the town, got permi&s;&s;ion to go to San|du&s;ky to trade, and as they propo&s;ed encamping about two leagues from the town, my&s;elf and &s;everal others, in a friendly manner, propo&s;ed and did accompany them in our &s;leighs to their fir&s;t &s;tage; but on our re|turn, I being a head, was challenged by De Jeane, at the head of thirty or forty &s;oldiers, by a&s;king who came there? to which I replied, John Dodge; he then ordered the &s;oldiers to &s;eize me and the two Gentlemen in the &s;leigh with me, and forced us to return to the en|campment we had ju&s;t left, where he &s;eized the whole of the Gentlemen, who were going, by permi&s;&s;ion, to Sandu&s;ky, with their goods, &s;leighs, &amp;c. and carried the whole of us, the next morning, back to the Fort, and charged us with &s;ending out goods to &s;upply (as he politely termed it) the Rebels.</P>
<P>After being detained three days in pri&s;on, I was taken to De Jeane's hou&s;e, to &s;ee my papers, books, de&s;ks, &amp;c. examined. They broke open my de&s;k, pretending to have lo&s;t the key. On &s;earching, they could not find any thing worth their notice, or what they expected to find. De Jeane then gave me my keys, and told me to &s;end for my de&s;k and take care of my&s;elf, as he would watch me; I told him, as he had taken it from my hou&s;e and broke it, he &s;hould mend it and &s;end it home, before I would receive it: Stop a a little, &s;aid he, I will &s;peak to the Governor, and fix you yet if I can; he then gave me into the care of the guard, and ordered me to goal. About the fifth day after this, not hearing any thing from him, I &s;ent for my violin, and was diverting my&s;elf, when Governor Hamilton pa&s;&s;ed by, and enquired who was playing on the violin, to which the Corporal of the guard an|&s;wered,
<PB N="20" REF="016262_0017_0F9BD10C441ECB58">
it was me. The next day, De Jeane waited me with a Black&s;mith, who &s;oon clapped on a pair of hand-bolts; and now, &s;ays De Jeane, I have fixed you, you may play the violin till you are tired; I a&s;ked him what I had done to be treated thus; for that you mu&s;t apply to the Governor, replied he, for it is his plea&s;ure that you are &s;o: He then threatened to put on leg-bolts; on which I told him, I did not value his irons, but if he kept me pri&s;oner, I &s;hould look to him for my property, (about 3000l.) Yes, &s;ays he, we will fix you and your property too, and then left me. A|bout &s;ix days after, I was taken to my own hou&s;e, where two Engli&s;h and two Frenchmen, by order of the Governor, took an inventory of my goods, and &s;oon after &s;old the whole at vendue, for about 1900l. New-York currency. Thus being a &s;econd time rob|bed of my property, I lay a pri&s;oner as contented as po&s;&s;ible, without any thing material happening, until the fir&s;t of May.</P>
<P>On the fir&s;t of May, 1778, I was put on board a ve&s;&s;el to go down to Quebec, and by &s;ome of my friends furni&s;hed with provi&s;ion and nece&s;&s;aries for the voyage; but of the&s;e I was robbed by De Jeane, and had it not been for &s;ome Gentlemen, pa&s;&s;engers in the &s;ame ve&s;&s;el, I mu&s;t have &s;uffered with hunger. On the fir&s;t of June I arrived at Quebec, where I was con|ducted to Mr. Printices, the Provo&s;t Mar&s;hal: Ha, ha, &s;ays he, Mr. Dodge, Are you here? I have often been told you were a damn'd ra&s;cal, doing all you could again&s;t government; it is a pity Gov. Hamilton did not hang you when he was about it, as he would have &s;aved government a great deal of trouble. From hence I was conducted on board the pri&s;on &s;hip, Meriah with a number of farmers, taken off their plantations by the Savages.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="016262_0018_0F9BD10E6C5BBE50">Two days after I was put on board the pri&s;on &s;hip, we were vi&s;ited by Mr. Murray, Commi&s;&s;ary of Pri|&s;oners, to whom I gave an account of my capture and ill u&s;age; he told me, he would &s;peak to the Gene|ral, and give me an an&s;wer. Two days after, he again came on board, and told me, as it was very difficult times, I could not have a hearing at pre&s;ent; I told him I wanted nothing but what the Engli&s;h con&s;titu|tion allowed, and if I could not get that in Quebec, I would apply to England; to which he replied, I had better be ea&s;y, for if I did not, he would put me in irons again.</P>
<P>I remained on board the pri&s;on &s;hip till the begin|ning of Augu&s;t, when Mr. Murray came on board, and informed me that I was not to go with the pri&s;oners; but if I would give my parole, I &s;hould be allowed the liberty of Quebec. I a&s;ked him the occa&s;ion I could not be &s;ent with the other pri&s;oners; he replied, it was the Governor's orders: I a&s;ked him if I was to be al|lowed any &s;upport; he &s;aid, not any. I told him it was very hard to be dragged from my hou&s;e, robbed of my property, deprived of my liberty, &s;ent 1200 miles in irons, and &s;till be held a pri&s;oner in the town of Quebec, without any allowance for &s;upport: All my applications were in vain, I was &s;et on &s;hore under pa|role the fourth of Augu&s;t, and the &s;hip &s;ailed with the other pri&s;oners &s;oon after.</P>
<P>The cau&s;e of my detention, as I was afterwards told by Mr. Murray, was, that Governor Hamilton, of Detroit, had wrote the General not to &s;end me round with the other pri&s;oners; for if I got into the United States, he knew I would come immediately upon him, and as I knew the country, was well acquainted with the lan|guages of the different Indians about the lakes, and had great influence among them, &s;hould be the means of their lo&s;ing the fort, which would be much again&s;t the crown.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="016262_0019_0F9BD10E825E75E8">On my enlargement, I &s;oon got acquainted with a number of gentlemen, who were friends to the United States, and the cau&s;e in which they were engaged. Some days after, going on &s;hore, I fell in company with a Mr. Jones, who happened at that time to be reading a letter &s;ent by General Montgomery, while he lay before Quebec, to Gov. Carlton, and on conclud|ing it, &s;aid he hoped General Montgomery was in hell, and that all the rebels would &s;oon be with him; to this I made a reply, words en&s;ued, and then blows; he drew on me, but I parried his thru&s;t with my cane, &s;o that I only got a &s;mall wound in my knee: He then made a complaint, and I was &s;ent for by the Ge|neral, who threatened to put me in confinement if I did not find &s;ecurity; this I &s;oon found, and bonds were given for me for two months; at the end of which, as they neglected renewing them, and left me without parole or &s;ecurity, I hired an Indian guide, and on the ninth of October, quitted Quebec. After a fa|tiguing march through the woods, on the 20th of November, I arrived at Bo&s;ton, where I was kindly received, and politely treated by General Gates, who &s;upplied my wants and forwarded me to his Excellency General Wa&s;hington; I waited on him, was politely received, and &s;ent on to Congre&s;s, having &s;ome mat|ters relating to Canada worthy their hearing.</P>
<P>Had the love of my country no ways prompted me to act again&s;t the tyranny of Britain, I leave it to the world to judge, whether I have not a right to revolt from under the dominion of &s;uch tyrants, and exert e|very faculty God has given me to &s;eek &s;atisfaction for the ill u&s;age I received; that if I had ten thou&s;and lives, and was &s;ure to lo&s;e them all, I think, &s;hould I not attempt to gain &s;atisfaction, I &s;hould de&s;erve to be a &s;lave the remainer of my life.</P>
