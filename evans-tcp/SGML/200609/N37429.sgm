<HEAD>PROSPECTUS OF A NEW WEEKLY PAPER, SUBMITTED TO MEN OF AFFLUENCE, MEN OF LIBERALITY, AND MEN OF LETTERS.</HEAD>
<P>A YOUNG MAN, once known among village-readers <NOTE N="1" PLACE="foot">The Editor, not without emotion, calls up in review the tranquil pleasures of a studious life, amid the ever-green forests of Newhampshire. In Solitude, "with her best nurse, Con|templation," he passed his "inoffensive day,"

The conclusion of the fourth Georgic of the Mantuan bard vividly describes the pursuits of "a self sequestered man." The nice ear'd Prosodist must forgive the substitution of harsh "Hantonia" for "Parthenope," the classical and the liquid.

<BIBL>VIRG.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>, as the humble historian of the hour, the conductor of a <HI>Farmer's</HI> Museum, and a <HI>Lay Preacher's</HI> Gazette, again offers himself to the public as a volunteer-editor. Having, as he con|ceives, a right to vary, at pleasure, his <HI>fictitious</HI> name, he now, for higher reasons than any fickle humour might dictate, assumes the appellation of OLDSCHOOL.<NOTE N="2" PLACE="foot">A name, which though harshly combined, is abun|dantly expressive, and not unprotected by analogical autho|rity. BOLINGBROKE published his Remarks on the History of England, under the name of <HI>Old Castle.</HI> To a diffident Editor, the machinery of a fictitious title is convenient. Sir Richard STEELE, as a periodical Mentor, appeared to many a delighted eye in the shape of an Isaac BICKERSTAFF, and a Nestor IRONSIDE; and, if an <HI>English Knight</HI> deemed it decorous to avail himself of the "immunities of invisibility," it is surely proper they should be claimed by an unobtrusive American.</NOTE> Fond of this title, indicative of his moral, political, and literary creed, he propo|ses publishing, every Saturday, on a super-royal quarto sheet,</P>
<P>A NEW WEEKLY PAPER, TO BE CALLED, THE PORT FOLIO,<NOTE N="3" PLACE="foot">Many periodical writers, seriously or jocosely, have des|cribed the difficulty of inventing an appropriate <HI>title.</HI> Though this to Cynical eyes may appear one of the frivolous cares of authorship, yet it has kept many an Essayist awake, for at least one night. Of the name for a popular vehicle it is required that it should be concise, modest, and appropriate. The words Port Folio, from the French <HI>Porte Feuille,</HI> are not to be found in Johnson's Dictionary, but they are very currently employ|ed, in pure English, to signify a <HI>portable repository for fugitive papers,</HI> which is the exact definition of this Miscellany. Edi|tors, ambitious of sonorous, or brilliant titles, frequently select a name, not intimately connected with the nature of their work. We hear of "The Mirror," and the "Aurora," but what relation has a literary essay with a <HI>polished plane of glass,</HI> or what have politics to do with The <HI>morning?</HI></NOTE>
BY OLIVER OLDSCHOOL, ESQ.</P>
<P>Warned by "the waywardness of the time<NOTE N="4" PLACE="foot"><P>This phrase alludes to our indifference to elegant let|ters, to the acrimony <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> our party bickerings, and to the uni|versal eagerness for political <HI>texts,</HI> and their <HI>commentary.</HI> Hence, it is generally, and not without reason, supposed that amid such "wild uproar," the gentle voice of the Muse is scarcely audible. Prudence, therefore, has dictated a concise paper, not quite a <HI>Gazette,</HI> nor wholly a <HI>Magazine,</HI> with something of Politics to interest Quidnuncs, and something of literature to engage Students. To those, who utterly despair of the success of such a plan, and to those who would deride the temerity of the Editor for <HI>persevering to the end,</HI> it may be said, that the <HI>first similar scheme</HI> in England commenced at a time, when the nation was divided into whigs and tories, and coxcombs and impertinents, rather than into Patrons and Readers. But, to use the Tatler's own words, "by forming that paper, by <HI>way of Letter of Intelligence,</HI> consisting of such parts as might gratify the curiosity of persons of all condi|tions, and each sex, the design, however executed, met with so great success, that there is hardly a name now eminent among us for power, wit, beauty, valour, or wisdom, which is not subscribed." This was no empty vaunt of Steele's, for on consulting the celebrated edition of the Tatler, published in 1786 by the indefatigable and accurate John Nichols, we find a list of the subscribers, at an early stage of the undertaking. The names are both very numerous, and very respectable.</P>
<P>The condition of a literary adventurer, meditating a new work, and solicited to publish by some, and to suppress by others, is drolly described by honest John BUNYAN. The con|clusion drawn by his whimsical logic is what might be ex|pected from the natural wishes, and self complacency of every author.</P>
<Q><L>Some said, John print it; others said, not so.</L>
<L>Some said, it might do good; others said, no.</L>
<L>Now I was in a strait, and did not see</L>
<L>Which was the best thing to be done by me:</L>
<L>At last I thought, since you are thus divided,</L>
<L>I print it will, and <HI>to the case decided!</HI></L></Q></NOTE>," and the admonitions of every honest printer, the Editor begins his work on a Lilliputian page, and, like a saving grocer, gives of his goods only a small sample; but Subscribers, if per|adventure <NOTE N="5" PLACE="foot"><P>The Editor employs this old fashioned adverb to ex|press his scepticism, with respect to the immediate encourage|ment and success of this paper. But under every disadvantage of a narrow subscription, he is resolved to persevere. He is sure of being fondly fostered by the liberal <HI>Few,</HI> and will trust to Time for the <HI>slow</HI> reward of literary toil.</P>
<P>This it is presumed will prove ultimately successful, if men of virtue, influence, genius, learning, and wealth as|sist his honest endeavours to promote the dissemination of the true, and the beautiful. But this assistance must be ren|dered with fervent zeal, and unabating kindness. A paper to be advantageously edited, must be liberally supported. The compositor <HI>must</HI> be requited for his mechanical toil, the publisher <HI>must</HI> be compensated for his cares and risque, and the conductor, if competent to his highly responsible duties, has a claim to what an ancient author, who well knew the value of literary service, calls the "quiddam honorarium," the generous stipend for mental efforts, not the paltry wages of a vulgar hireling. If an industrious and high minded man thus situated, received only a servant's price of labour, he will quickly sink to the level of the mercenary fugitive in the gospel. He will flee from or neglect his duty, because he is an <HI>Hireling.</HI></P>
<P>Literary industry, usefully employed has a sort of draught upon the bank of opulence, and has the right of entry into the mansion of every Maecenas. When to government or to in|dividuals it renders actual service, gives harmless pleasure to some, and new ideas to others, it confers at least a species of obligation, which any code of ethical precept will teach men to repay. Let not this be considered a mercenary doctrine, and let not writers be rashly censured for <HI>vending</HI> the fruits of mind. Authors, far elevated above the mire of low avarice, have thought it debasement to make Literature common and cheap. The affluent lord LYTTLETON made his history of Henry II. a book-sellers property at the price of three thous|and pounds; and Gibbon, and Robertson, and Blair, and Sir William Jones sold their manuscripts for sums, which the generosity of Britain did not scruple to pay, nor the pride of authorship blush to receive.</P></NOTE> the Editor should have any, <HI>must not "despise the day of small things."</HI> It is proposed always to give plenty of letter-press, in proportion to the public demand, and, as the exigency of the season, or copiousness of materials may require, to double, treble, and even quadruple the number of pages in the PORT FOLIO. Hereafter, more may be done, if more be wanted, and if more be fostered. At present, with the prudent policy of wary beginners, it is judged expedient to risk but little. No sonorous promises are made, and no magnificence of style attempted. The paper is to be neither <HI>wire-woven,</HI> nor <HI>hot-pressed,</HI> and it certainly, in more senses than one, shall not be <HI>cream-coloured;</HI> but, in a plain dress of Quaker simplicity, may, perhaps, offer something tolera|ble on political, literary, and transient topics, and something, auxiliary to sound principles, which, <HI>after church,</HI> "retired leisure <NOTE N="6" PLACE="foot">MILTON. Il Penseroso.</NOTE>" may read on Sunday<NOTE N="7" PLACE="foot">The choice of <HI>Saturday</HI> is propitious to our plan. The leisure, which is generally found, or made on that day, toge|ther with the retirement and quiet of the Sabbath, seem to in|vite moral speculations, and "the cherub Contemplation." The union of Literature, Piety, and Morals, is fervently and elegantly wished by the admirable author of "The Pursuits of Literature," a lofty and columnar work, whose grace and strength will endure, when the delusions of fanatic democracy and Gallic philosophy shall have vanished, like the filthy fogs of a morbid autumn.
<Q><L>"Oh, never may Castalia's streams divide</L>
<L>From Siloa's brook and Jordan's hallow'd tide."</L></Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Empirical vaunting is always nauseous and arrogant; and the plausibility of mighty promise has generally a pitiful conclusion. The Editor, with honest diffidence, declines making specious engagements; timid, lest time or chance, lest la|ziness, sickness, or stupidity, should step between stipulation and fulfilment, he applies to himself one of the didactics of Solomon, and
<Q>boasts not himself of to-morrow, for he knows not what a day may bring forth.</Q></P>
<P>But though the making of such promises is no less trite than fallacious, and it is the part of Effrontery to exclaim,
<Q>I possess adequate pow|ers, and I will perform mighty things,</Q>
yet, on the other hand, it will be both novel and safe for an Editor to declare, what he will <HI>avoid.</HI> More certain and confident respecting that which he can <HI>shun,</HI> than that which he can <HI>accomplish,</HI> he stipulates, with perfect sincerity, <HI>not to do</HI> certain things, and makes his public contract as Theolo|gians, at the beginning of the century, used to divide their sermons, with a First, <HI>negatively.</HI></P>
<P>He <HI>will not</HI> publish an <HI>impartial</HI> <NOTE N="8" PLACE="foot"><P>I would not take one of these, says a great orator, speaking with all contempt of the impartial tribe, I would not take one of these for my arbitrator in a dispute, for so much as a fish pond, for if he reserved the mud to me, he would be sure to give the water, that fed the pool, to my ad|versary</P>
<BIBL>EDMUND BURKE.</BIBL>
<P>Dr. SMOLLET, in one of his merry novels, describing a quackish prescription of a <HI>neutral</HI> draught, adds, "it was so <HI>neutral,</HI> as to declare neither for the patient nor the disease." Such is the neutrality of many a news-paper; and it may be added, of its readers too, men of <HI>convenient</HI> maxims, who can cry amen to every creed, and venture on all sides, with|out being trusted by any. Of such infamous principles the Editor has the deepest abhorrence, and for the silly scheme of Impartiality, he cherishes the most ineffable contempt. This is not a time for "creamy smoothness" in our speculations, nor for lukewarmness in our conduct. When "bold bad men" are assailing THE CITADEL, and violating the tombs of the ancients, and plucking up the old land-marks, it is salutary to apply to each timid Bystander what was once indignantly addressed to the supineness of Laodicea, "I know thy works that thou art <HI>neither cold nor hot,</HI> I would thou wert cold or hot." When Classical Learning is exploded as a senseless study of words; public quiet disturbed by every boorish bawler; a church pronounced no better than a barn, and the bible classed with an obsolete almanac: When Genius, Ta|lents, and Virtue are wrenched from their just elevation, and "trodden under the hoofs of a swinish multitude," it is right and decorous, and useful to be <HI>partial, bigotted,</HI> adhesive to old systems.</P></NOTE> paper, in that style of cold, callous, supine, and criminal in|difference,

which views, with equal eye, a chief|tain, and a follower&mdash;a man of sense, and a fool&mdash; the philosophy of the Greeks, and the philosophy of the French&mdash;a stable government, and the uproar of anarchy. He will not make his paper "a <HI>carte-blanche</HI> on which every fool and knave may scribble what he pleases." To gratify the malignancy of fanatics, he will not <HI>asperse</HI> the government or the church, the laws or the literature of England. Remembering that WE ARE AT PEACE with that power&mdash;that the most wholesome portions of our polity are modelled from hers&mdash;that we kneel at Shrines, and speak a language common to both, he will not flagitiously and foolishly advert to ancient animosities, nor, with rash hand, attempt to hurl the brand of discord between the nations.</P>
<P>He will not strive to please the populace,<NOTE N="9" PLACE="foot"><P>To the lower classes of our motley vulgar, too often composed of the scoundrels of all nations, and perpetually restless and rebellious, may be applied a description from the most vigorous poet in the language.</P>

<P>One of the primary objects of this undertaking is to com|bat revolutionary doctrine. The opinion of a profound Eng|lish lawyer deserves quoting in this place. He thought rightly, though he acted wrong. "Alteration is dangerous, because we know not where it will stay; 'tis like a milstone, that lies upon the top of a pair of stairs; if once it be thrust off the first stair, it never stays till it comes to the bottom.</P>
<BIBL>SELDEN.</BIBL>
<P>In an age, when inversion is the order of the day, the mo|dern idea of improvement does not consist in altering, but extirpating. We do not reform, but subvert. We do not cor|rect old systems, but demolish them; fancying that when eve|ry thing shall be new it will be perfect. Not to have been wrong, but to have been at all, is the crime. Excellence is no longer considered as an experimental thing, which is to grow gradually out of observation and practice, and to be improved by the accumulating additions brought by the wisdom of suc|cessive ages. Our wisdom is not slowly perfected by age and gradual growth, but a goddess, which starts at once, full grown, mature, armed cap a pee, from the heads of our mo|dern thunderers. Or rather, a perfect system is <HI>now</HI> expected inevitably to spring at once, like the fabled bird of Ara|bia, from the ashes of its parent; and, like that, can receive its birth no other way, but by the destruction of its predeces|sor.</P>

<P>And, lastly, He will not print any other than a uniform, correct, and independent paper; nor gratify the caprice of parties, sects, or individu|als, by departing, no, not for a moment, from that scheme of political and literary composition, which has hitherto been pursued by the Editor, with sufficient approbation from the good<NOTE N="12" PLACE="foot"><L>Happy my studies&punc; when by <HI>these</HI> approv'd,</L>

<P>Those who aspire to a solid erudition, must undoubtedly take other methods to acquire it. They have their labour and their merit. But there are readers of another order, who must not be left wholly unprovided: For such readers, it is our province to collect matters of a lighter nature; but pleasing even by their levity; by their variety; and by their aptitude to enter into common conversation. Things of this sort often gradually and imperceptibly insinuate a taste for knowledge, and in some measure gratify that taste. They steal some mo|ments from the round of dissipation and pleasure. They re|lieve the minds of men of business, who cannot pass from severe labour to severe study with an elegant relaxation They preserve the strenuous idleness of many from a worse employment.</P>

<BIBL><HI>Dr. Johnson.</HI> Preface to the Literary Magazine</BIBL></NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>Having succinctly stated what he will avoid, and what he will attempt, the Editor now feels the propriety, the necessity, the utility of sum|moning to his aid the <HI>Master-Spirits</HI> of the na|tion. It must be apparent to the most heedless observer, that it is the object of this undertaking, to combine literature with politics, and attempt something of a more honorable destiny, than a meagre journal. To accomplish this purpose, the co-operation of many minds is requisite; and, without the cheerful and constant contributions of erudition, taste, and genius, an Editor, the most inventive and industrious, would have fre|quent occasion to sigh over his pages, either "mournfully jejune," or ignominiously vacant and incorrect. The causes of the inaccuracy, inequalities, dulness, and, at length, the total fai|lure of many of our American Gazettes may be easily traced; and it may be useful to read a <Q>brief chronicle</Q>
of the rise, progress, and downfal of a newspaper, lamely conducted, and penuri|ously supported.</P>
<P>An obscure and illiterate individual, of mere mechanical skill in the art of printing, contracts debt for his press and paper, and issues proposals for a Gazette. As education or habit, as chance or interest, may determine, he professes himself a republican, or a federalist; or, what is more common, a man of no party; willing to publish trash for all, and pretending to be unbiassed by any. <HI>Fervet opus.</HI> The press groans, the work begins, and <HI>with</HI> the paltry aid of <HI>two</HI> or <HI>three hun|dred</HI> subscribers, and <HI>without</HI> assistants, either literary or political, he, of necessity, prints from week to week <HI>a thing</HI>&mdash;"without a name," with|out correctness, without consistency; in narra|tion turbid, or false, in comment clumsy, in its original departments crude and juvenile, in its selections uncouth, vicious in the humblest com|binations of grammar, and a trespasser on all the limits of language.<NOTE N="15" PLACE="foot">This fashionable mode of bad writing is forcibly, though quaintly ridiculed by the vivacious HOWELL, an "old Eng|lish gentleman" of sound understanding, and of sparkling wit "A kind of simpering, and lank hectic expressions, made up of a bombast of words and finical affected compli|ments only. I cannot well away with such sleazy stuff, with such cobweb composition, where there is <HI>no strength of matter,</HI> nothing for the reader to carry away with him, that may <HI>en+large the notions of his soul.</HI>"</NOTE> A puny bantling from the press "so faint, so spiritless, so dull, so dead in look," quickly "goeth to its long home," its <HI>inky</HI> "mourners go about the streets," and its <HI>numerous</HI> sponsors and friends strangely wonder at its dissolution.</P>
<P>Thus conducted, and thus unsupported, can it be expected that a paper should flourish in vigor, or possess interest; that it should furnish docu|ments to the Historian, or even amusement to

the Lounger? The journals of Europe are res|pectable, are read eagerly, and preserved long, because they are under the direction of active skill, assisted by the researches of statesmen, and the liberal labours of literature and genius.&mdash; <HI>Abroad,</HI> it is generally understood that the di|rector of a press is a scholar and a gentleman <NOTE N="16" PLACE="foot">It is well known to all, who are conversant in the history of the writers in the reign of Queen Ann and of George II. that some of the finest wits of the age, both scho|lars and statesmen, were actively engaged in writing for the public papers. Dean Swift, Mr. Addison, Sir Richard Steele, Lord Bolingbroke, &amp;c. At a subsequent period, Henry Field|ing. Mr. Kelly and the Bishop of Dromor<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> wrote in the ga|zettes. Richardson, the author of Clarissa, was the conduc|tor of two papers, and Bowyer, one of the most learned of English printers, published for many years a weekly museum.</NOTE>. In Germany and Holland, university professors, men erudite and dignified, are frequently engaged in this honourable service. A <HI>Gazette of Leyden,</HI> and a <HI>Spectator of the North</HI> have been conducted by men who associated the statesman's research and the scholar's lore; men who visited the tombs of the learned, and the camps of the vali|ant. In France, under the <HI>old government,</HI> abb&eacute;s, lawyers, and men of letters by profession, super|intended the <HI>flying-sheets</HI> of the time; and now, UNDER THE ANARCHY, it is notorious that all the public prints, <HI>controuled by whatever faction,</HI> are composed, or compiled, by men of invention and learning, many of whom were <HI>once</HI> among the clergy. In Scotland, more than one paper has been illuminated by many a ray from the constel|lations of genius and wisdom, shining in her three universities; and in England, not to mention that political articles and arguments are frequently furnished by the ministry themselves, the best and most popular papers exhibit the abilities of numerous writers, ACTING IN CONFEDERACY. The memory of WOODFALL has supplied with parliamentary debates the columns of a Chronicle, and DUNNING has given it sparkling wit, and lo|gical precision. By the side of SMART's poetry, Dr. JOHNSON published his Idlers in a Saturday's paper, by Newberry. The Whitehall Evening Post, and the St. James' Chronicle numbered Soame JENYNS, Lord CHESTERFIELD, and Ho|race WALPOLE, on an ample catalogue of accom|plished auxiliaries; and both the literary virtu|oso, and the laborious annalist, still preserve and read the files of "The Public Advertiser," which displayed, at one period, the political arguments of the Marquis of ROCKINGHAM, the playful hu|mour of Dr. GOLDSMITH, the polite literature of ARTHUR MURPHY, and the gorgeous imagery of EDMUND BURKE<NOTE N="17" PLACE="foot">Well conducted, authentic, and accurate newspapers often afford useful, and sometimes the only materials to the historian. Bolingbroke somewhere in his letters mentions the utility of gazettes both to the studious and the compiler of History. BURKE and Dr. Campbell, who for many years furnished the historical article in Dodsley's Annual Register were largely indebted to the news writers of the time. A very tolerable narrative of the American war (published in 1779 by Faulder in Bond street) was compiled almost en|tirely from gazettes: and the Paris "Moniteur" at the earlier <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> French revolution, was the ground work of more <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> the events of a memorable epoch.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From the experience of some years, while he was conducting the FARMER's MUSEUM, a paper pronounced, by the partiality of the public, not altogether vacant of original composition, the Editor concludes, that of learning and wit, an al|liance <HI>defensive</HI> can be formed even here. Pri|vate assurances have been already made of libe|ral contributions from learned minds; and the Editor will omit nothing, which can add to the literary forces of this enterprize. To this end, a correspondence with men of political information, and miscellaneous writers will be commenced; and arrangements are already made, to obtain from Europe every new and interesting publication, which, either for use or ornament, may sup|ply proper materials to be deposited in the PORT-FOLIO.</P>

Me|ritorious essays shall always be cordially wel|comed, and bad ones dismissed with urbanity. From the very nature, and demands of the un|dertaking, the Editor will sometimes be compelled to the ungrateful task of rejection; but he will al|ways "glance an eye of pity" on juvenile imper|fections, and though the crude and incorrect must be denied a place in the PORT-FOLIO, yet the de|nial shall not be conveyed in terms contemptuous, or austere.</P>
<P>In this invocation to correspondents, it is pro|per and pleasant to name the CLERGY. From their love of letters, from their literary leisure, and from their order and regularity of life, so propitious to mental exertion, they are peculiarly interested in the advancement of every vehicle of knowledge. The members of that dignified and pious profession, who, in the words of PROSPERO, are
<Q><L>&mdash;"All dedicated</L>
<L>To closeness, and the bettering of the mind."</L></Q>
are entreated to become auxiliaries. To such Mentors, as candid, consistent, and enlightened Clergymen, we shall always lend a listening ear, and give the confiding heart<NOTE N="19" PLACE="foot">It is highly honourable to the character of the priesthood, that both in monkish and modern time, they have been either faithful depositaries, or laborious teachers, or diligent culti|vators of science.

The Jesuits, in the age of Lewis the fourteenth, fami|liarized to Gallic nobles every Athenian and Roman expres|sion; and a Lowth and a Watson have adorned the schools as well as the pulpit.

<P>The gentlemen of the bar, to whose liberality and genius the Editor is largely indebted for much of the diffusion, and many of the materials, of the papers, he formerly conducted, are solicited to supply pages for the Port-Folio, when the <HI>Court Docket</HI> is <HI>cleared,</HI> and when the client has paid "the uttermost" of his <HI>fee.</HI> Though duty and interest urge every Barrister to employ "his courage, and his care," in climbing the rugged steep of jurisprudence, yet, lawyers are splendid|ly distinguished for <HI>polite,</HI> as well as professional studies.

<P>The name of Sir WILLIAM JONES demands the amplest tribute of praise.

He is "a legitimate English classic." He has omitted nothing useful or pleasant in lite|rature. He has translated the oratory of the Greeks, and compiled a grammar of the Persic; he has methodized the most chaotic of English law titles, and described the ju|risprudence and morals, the arts and amusements of Asia. He has instructed and charmed the courts of Calcutta, and playfully investigated the origin of chess. He has embodied the features of the landscape of Hinzuan, and composed clas|sical epithalamiums on wedded Beauty.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>In aid of a paper, principally devoted to moral instruction, and polite literature, it would be equally indecorous and undeserved, to neglect so|liciting the good opinion, and assistance of the ladies. The influence of female elegance on the manners, and female principles on the character of men, is wide and powerful. They not only fix the standard of fashion, but regulate most of the duties, and decencies of life. On every question of delicacy, and sentiment, and taste, and decorum, they have the clearest right to be respectfully heard. To the honour of the country, especi|ally of its CAPITAL, where their education is the most sedulously regarded, there are many, who, possessing learning, which would be thought extensive in the other sex, set an example of deep humility to their own;&mdash;women who distinguish|ed for wit and genius, are eminent for domestic qualities; who, excelling in the fine arts, have carefully enriched their understandings; and who have not refined elegance into insipidity, nor frit|tered down delicacy into frivolousness<NOTE N="21" PLACE="foot"><BIBL>H.

Such fe|males can give grace, strength, and lustre to Liter|rature, can weave the brightest textures in the loom of Fancy, and teach the noblest morals of the heart. To this respectable and polished class of female characters, the Editor looks confidently for the exertion of their influence, and for the display of their talents in support of his Miscella|ny. It has been his privilege to know more than one highly instructed and accomplished woman, indulging herself in a chaste display of literary as well as fashionable excellence, benignant to the votaries of science, which she loved, and patroniz|ing the learning which she herself adorned. Flat|tery and fondness have extolled the Aspasias and the Glyceras of Athens, and the Talliens of

<P>Nor is the Editor of that hermit humour, to be regardless of the innocent wishes of the modish tribe. Though it cannot correctly be expected that he should be a critic of <HI>Coquelicot,</HI> or learned in <HI>laces;</HI> yet, he will not omit to notice sometimes the shop of the milliner, and "watch the wild vicissitudes of taste." Fashionable <HI>dress,</HI> as well as manners, shall be occasionally described; and to please the flaunting belle, he will, with no lan|guid voice, and in the words of Anstey, invoke <HI>her</HI> tutelary power.</P>

<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<P>The price will be five dollars annually, and it is requested of subscribers that the money be paid in advance. To many this may appear a rigorous and unpleasant exaction, but, as the expences of the pub|lication will be great, and as it is extremely difficult, not to say impracticable, to collect small sums, at re|mote periods, or from remote situations, it is believ|ed that the <HI>considerate</HI> and the <HI>liberal,</HI> to whom this is addressed, will cheerfully comply with the condi|tion.</P>

<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<P>No single paper to be sold, nor any subscription for less than a year to be received. No advertise|ments to be inserted in the body of the work; but as they principally contribute both to the profit and the circulation of every <HI>City</HI> paper, the Editor hopes that Merchants and Booksellers will not forget this cir|cumstance.

<P>City subscribers shall be regularly supplied by the carriers; and, by the mail, it shall be punctual|ly transmitted to gentlemen, in different parts of the United States, and British America, who are incli|ned to read and circulate a paper, which, vacant of advertisements, must be peculiarly desirable to re|mote residents, naturally studious of original com|position, and political documents, unmixed with mere local and commercial matter.</P>

<P>All letters and communications for the Port-Folio must be <HI>Post-paid,</HI> and addressed to Mr. As|bury Dickins, bookseller, Philadelphia. To facili|tate City correspondence, a <HI>letter box</HI> will be placed in the window.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="conclusion">
<P>SUCH are the outlines, and terms of an adventurous paper, which, not without anxiety, is now to be presented to the public. Between Criticism and the conducter of the Port-Folio, there are but few hours: and, during a suspense, so interesting in the annals of a writer, the proudest heart would beat, and the firmest nerves tremble. In this walk of composition, this is not the Editors <HI>first</HI> essay. To some little experience, he may, without arrogance, pretend, who for many years has been laboriously employed in a Literary Journal. At an early season of life, he voluntarily forsook the path of ordinary business, for a <HI>lowly</HI> seat in the Muses' bower. Though his choice has not enriched, or advanced him, yet of its propriety he has never doubted. "I was," says Mr. HUME, "seized very early with a passion for literature, which has been the ruling passion of my life, and the great source of my enjoyments." The heart of every literary enthusiast is always responsive to such sentiments; the Editor has a <HI>right</HI> to make a similar declaration. In com|mon too with many others, he has long been urged by a sober wish, or, if the sneering reader will have it so, he has long been deluded by the visionary whim, of making literature the hand-maid of Fortune, or, at least, of securing something like independency, by exertions, as a man of letters. Hitherto, his success has been far from brilliant: But though the gains of Authorship have been trivial, yet once they secured him a portion of <HI>rural</HI> comfort, and, perhaps, they will enable him to flourish in a city. The antici|pations of an adventurer, are like the desires of a lover, "Gay hope is their's by Fancy fed." With a spirit lofty, yet not insolent, with a voice timid, yet not servile, he calls on his countrymen to inspect and appreciate his labours; and, with a <HI>moderate</HI> estimate, he will persevere and be cheerful.</P>
