<HEAD>A NARRATIVE, &amp;.</HEAD>
<P>I, EBENEZER FLETCHER, li&s;ted into the Continental Army, in Capt. Carr's Company, in Colonel Nathan Hale's Regiment, as a fifer, and joined the Army at Ticonderoga under the command of General Saint Clair, in the Spring of 1777, at which place I was &s;tationed till the retreat of the Army which was the 6th of July following.</P>
<P>Early on the morning of the &s;ame day, or|ders came to &s;trike our tents and &s;wing our packs. It was generally conjectured that we were going to battle; but orders came immedi|ately to march. We marched &s;ome di&s;tance before light. By &s;unri&s;e the enemy had land|ed from their boats, and pur&s;ued us &s;o clo&s;ely as to fire on our rear. A large body of the en|emy followed us all day but kept &s;o far behind as not to be wholly di&s;covered. Their aim was to attack us &s;uddenly the next morning, as they did.</P>
<P>Having ju&s;t recovered from the mea&s;les, and not being able to march with the main body, I fell in the rear. The morning after our re|treat, orders came very early for the troops to refre&s;h and be ready for marching. Some were eating, &s;ome were cooking, and all in a
<PB N="4" REF="033740_0004_0FF8C13D6BD701D8">
very unfit po&s;ture for battle. Ju&s;t as the &s;un ro&s;e, there was a cry <HI>"the enemy are upon us."</HI>&mdash;Looking round, I &s;aw the enemy in line of bat|tle. Orders came to lay down our packs and be ready for action. The fire in&s;tantly began. We were but few in number compared to the enemy. At the commencement of the battle, many of our party retreated back into the woods. Capt. Carr came up and &s;ays, "My lads, advance, we &s;hall beat them yet." A few of us followed him in view of the enemy. Ev|ery man was trying to &s;ecure him&s;elf behind girdled trees, which were &s;tanding on the place of action. I made &s;helter for my&s;elf and di&s;|charged my piece. Having loaded again and taken aim, my piece mi&s;&s;ed fire. I brought the &s;ame a &s;econd time to my face; but before I had time to di&s;charge it, I received a mu&s;ket ball in the &s;mall of my back and fell with my gun cocked. My uncle Daniel Fo&s;ter &s;tanding but little di&s;tance from me, I make out to crawl to him and &s;poke to him. He and another man lifted me and carried me back &s;ome di&s;tance and laid me down behind a large tree, where was another man crying out mo&s;t bitterly with a grievous wound. By this time I had bled &s;o freely, I was very weak and faint. I ob&s;erved the enemy were likely to gain the ground. Our men began to retreat and the enemy to advance. Having no friend to afford me any relief, eve|ry one taking care of him&s;elf, all things looked very &s;hocking to me; to remain where I was and fall into the hands of the enemy, e&s;pecially in the condition I was in, expecting to receive
<PB N="5" REF="033740_0005_0FF8F6305F6677A8">
no mercy. It came into my mind to conceal my&s;elf from them if po&s;&s;ible. I made u&s;e of my hands and knees, as well as I could, and crawled about two rods among &s;ome &s;mall bru&s;h and got under a log. Here I lay con|cealed from the enemy, who came in&s;tantly to the place I lay wounded at. What became of my di&s;tre&s;&s;ed partner I know not. The enemy pur&s;ued our men in great ha&s;te. Some of them came over the log where I lay. Some came &s;o near I could almo&s;t touch them. I was not di&s;covered by the enemy till the battle was over. When they were picking up the dead and wounded among the bru&s;h and logs, I heard them coming towards me. I began to be much terrified, lea&s;t I &s;hould be found. I flattered my&s;elf that our men would come back after the battle was over and take me off; but to my great &s;urpri&s;e, two of the enemy came &s;o nigh, I heard one of them &s;ay, "Here is one of the rebels." I lay flat on my face acro&s;s my hands, rolled in my blood. I dared not &s;tir, being a|fraid they meant me by &s;aying, "Here is one of the rebels." They &s;oon came to me and pulled off my &s;hoes, &s;uppo&s;ing me to be dead. I looked up and &s;poke, telling them I was their pri&s;oner, and begged to be u&s;ed well. "Damn you, &s;ays one, you de&s;erve to be u&s;ed well don't you? What's &s;uch a young rebel as you fighting for?" One of the&s;e men was an offi|cer, who appeared to be a pretty &s;ort of a man. He &s;poke to the &s;oldier, who had taken my &s;hoes, and &s;ays, "Give back the &s;hoes and help the man into camp." My &s;hoes were given
<PB N="6" REF="033740_0006_0FF8C140EF385D18">
back by the &s;oldier according to order. The &s;oldier then rai&s;ed me on to my feet and con|ducted to the Briti&s;h camp. Here I found a number of my brother &s;oldiers in the &s;ame &s;itu|ation of my&s;elf. I was laid on the ground and remained in this po&s;ture till the afternoon, be|fore my wound was dre&s;&s;ed. Two Doctors came to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance. They rai&s;ed me up and examined my back. One of them &s;ays, "My lad, you &s;tood a narrow chance; had the ball gone in or out half its bigne&s;s, you mu&s;t have been killed in&s;tantly." I a&s;ked him if he thought there was any pro&s;pect of my getting well again. He an&s;wered, "There is &s;ome pro&s;pect." I concluded by his reply, he con&s;id|ered my ca&s;e hazardous. The Doctors appear|ed to be very kind and faithful. They pulled &s;everal pieces of my clothes from my wound, which were forced in by the ball I received.</P>
<P>Some of the enemy were very kind; while others were very &s;piteful and malicious. One of them came and took my &s;ilver &s;hoe buckles and left me an old pair of bra&s;s ones, and &s;aid, <HI>exchange was no robbery;</HI> but I thought it robbe|ry at a high rate. Another came and took off my neck handkerchief. An old negro came and took my fife, which I con&s;idered as the greate&s;t in&s;ult I had received while with the enemy. The Indians often came and abu&s;ed us with their language; calling us Yankees and rebels; but they were not allowed to injure us. I was &s;tripped of every thing valuable about me.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="033740_0007_0FF8F634C83DB208">
The enemy &s;oon marched back to Ticonde|roga, and left only a few to take care of the wounded. I was treated as well as I could ex|pect. Doctor Haze was the head Doctor, and he took true care that the pri&s;oners were well treated. Doctor Block&s;om, an under &s;urgeon, appeared to be very kind indeed: he was the one, who had the care of me: he never gave me any in&s;ulting or abu&s;ive language: he &s;ome|times would &s;ay, "Well, my lad, think you'll be willing to li&s;t in the King's &s;ervice, if you &s;hould get well? My an&s;wer was always <HI>no.</HI> The officers would flatter me to li&s;t in their ser|vice; telling me they were very &s;ure to con|quer the country, &s;ince they had got our &s;trong|e&s;t po&s;t. I told them I &s;hould not li&s;t.</P>
<P>But among all the troubles I met with, I re|ceived particular favors from two of the Brit|i&s;h. This conduct appeared to me very remark|able; why or wherefore it &s;hould be, I knew not; but he, who hath the hearts of all men in his hands, gave me favor in their &s;ight. They would often vi&s;it me, and a&s;k me if I wanted any thing to eat or drink. If I did, I had it. The fir&s;t time one of the&s;e friends came to me, was &s;oon after I was brought to camp. As I lay on the ground, he a&s;ked me if I did not want a bed to lie on I told him I did: he goes and gets a large hemlock bark, and finding many old coats and overalls, taken from the dead and wounded, and putting them in the bark, made me a bed, and laid me into it. He built a &s;helter over me with barks, to keep the rain from me, which was a great kindne&s;s as it
<PB N="8" REF="033740_0008_0FF8F6375BAFD078">
rained exceedingly hard the next night. He went to a &s;pring and brought me water as often as I wanted, which was very often, being very dry; my lo&s;s of blood occa&s;ioning much thir&s;t. He a&s;ked me, al&s;o, if I wanted to eat. I an|&s;wered yes; for having eat very little that day, I was very faint and hungry. He told me, he did not know as it was in his power to procure any thing for me, but would go and try. After an ab&s;ence of con&s;iderable time (certainly the time &s;eemed long) he returned with a piece of boiled pork and broiled liver, telling me this was all the food he could get. I thanked him and told him it was very good.</P>
<P>The next day he came and told me he had orders to march and mu&s;t therefore leave me; was very &s;orry he could &s;tay no longer with me; but hoped &s;omebody would take good care of me; taking me by the hand he wi&s;hed me well and left me.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of &s;o good a friend grieved me ex|tremely; but I &s;oon heard that my other friend was ordered to &s;tay behind to help take care of the wounded. My &s;pirits, which before were very much depre&s;&s;ed, when I heard of this, were much exhilarated; and once more I felt tolerably happy. The difference in mankind never &s;truck me more &s;en&s;ibly than while a pri&s;oner. Some would do every thing in their power to make me comfortable and cheerful; while others abu&s;ed me with the vile&s;t of lan|guage; telling me that the pri&s;oners would all be hanged; that they would drive all the damn|ed rebels into the &s;ea, and that their next win|ter
<PB N="9" REF="033740_0009_0FF8F63CA5EF0B58">
quarters would be in Bo&s;ton. They cer|tainly wintered in Bo&s;ton; but to their great di&s;appointment and chagrin, as pri&s;oners of war.</P>
<P>But to return. My wound being now a lit|tle better, I began to think of making my e&s;|cape from the enemy. Two of my fellow pri&s;|oners agreed to accompany me; one of them being well acquainted with the way to Otter|creek. This plan, however, failed; for, before we had an opportunity for making our e&s;cape, Doctor Haze called upon my companions to be ready to march for Ticonderoga; telling them that the next morning they mu&s;t leave this place. Thus I found, that as &s;oon as the pri&s;oners were able to ride, they were ordered to Ticondero|ga. Being thus di&s;appointed I begged of the Doctor to let me go with them. Says he, "You are very dangerou&s;ly wounded, and it is im|proper for you to ride &s;o far yet; but as &s;oon as you are able you &s;hall go." Being thus de|feated I again re&s;olved to run away, even if I went alone, and it was not long before I had an opportunity. As all the pri&s;oners were &s;ent off except us, who were badly wounded, they thought it unnece&s;&s;ary to guard us very clo&s;ely. I &s;oon was able to go to the &s;pring, which was at a little di&s;tance from camp. Thither I often went for water for my&s;elf and the He&s;&s;ians, who, by the way, appeared to be plea&s;ed with me, for I often waited upon them; brought them water, made their beds. &amp;c. and I found I fared the better for it. I often walked out into the woods where we had the battle; went to the tree where I was &s;hot down; ob&s;erved
<PB N="10" REF="033740_0010_0FF8F63E57E90090">
the trees that were very much marked with the balls. One day as I was looking around, I found a few leaves of a bible; the&s;e I carried into the camp and diverted my&s;elf by reading them; for I felt much more contented when I had &s;omething to read. My friend, whom I have before mentioned, one day brought me a very good book, which he told me to keep as a pre&s;ent from him. This I heartily thanked him for, and whenever I was tired by walking, would lay down and read.</P>
<P>On the 22d of July, a number of men came down from Ticonderoga, with hor&s;es and litters &s;ufficient to carry off the remainder of the wounded. Doctor Haze came to us and told us, that tomorrow we &s;hould all be carried where we &s;hould have better care taken of us. Says he, "I will &s;end the orderly &s;ergeant, who will &s;ee that your bloody clothes are well wa&s;hed." This, he thought, would be very agreeable news to us. I pretended to be very much plea&s;ed, though I was determined never to go. I told the per&s;on, who lay next to me, that I intended to run away; de&s;ired him to make them believe I had taken the north road, if they inclined to pur&s;ue me, for I &s;hould take the &s;outh. Says he, "I will do all in my power to a&s;&s;i&s;t you, and wi&s;h it was po&s;&s;ible for me to go with you."</P>
<P>I made it my bu&s;ine&s;s that day to procure provi&s;ion &s;ufficient for my journey. I had &s;pared a little bread from my daily allowance, and although dry and mouldy, yet it was the be&s;t to he had. I had left, a large jack-knife the enemy had not robbed me of; I &s;old this
<PB N="11" REF="033740_0011_0FF8F643020760F0">
for a pint of wine, thinking it would do me more good on my march than the knife, as I found afterwards it did. The wine I put in a bottle and carefully &s;towed it in my pocket. I was hard put to it to get my &s;hirt wa&s;hed and dried before evening. However, agreeing with &s;ome to make their beds if they would dry my &s;hirt, it was ready to put on by dark. I then went to my tent, took of my coat and jacket, and put on my clean &s;hirt over my dirty one, and hav|ing filled my pockets with the little provi&s;ion I had &s;aved, I began my march homeward &s;hoe|le&s;s; reflecting what I &s;hould do for &s;o material part of my cloathing. It came into my mind that one Jonathan Lambart a day or two before had died of his wounds and left a good pair of &s;hoes. Suppo&s;ing my right to them equal to a|ny other per&s;on, I took them and put them on, hereby rever&s;ing the old proverd, <HI>He that waits for dead men's &s;hoes will go barefoot.</HI></P>
<P>It being dark I went out undi&s;covered and &s;teered into the woods. After going a little way, I turned into the road and made a halt. Now was the trying &s;cene! The night being very dark, every thing before me appeared gloomy and di&s;couraging; my wound was far from be|ing healed; my &s;trength much reduced by the lo&s;s of blood, pain, and poor living: thus &s;itu|ated to travel alone, I knew not where, having no knowledge of the way, I thought it would be highly pre&s;umptuous. How far I &s;hould have to travel before I could reach any inhab|itants, I could not tell: Indians, I &s;uppo&s;ed, were lurking about, and probably I might be
<PB N="12" REF="033740_0012_0FF8C148DA89A3E0">
be&s;et by them and murdered or carried back; and if I avoid them, perhaps perri&s;h in the wil|derne&s;s. Reflecting upon the&s;e things, my re&s;|olution began to flag, and I thought it mo&s;t pru|dent to return and take my fate. I turned a|bout and went back a few rods, when the fol|lowing words &s;truck me as if whi&s;pered in my ear: <HI>Put not your hand to the plough and look back.</HI> I immediately turned about again, fully re&s;olved to pur&s;ue my journey through the woods; but before morning, had I been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of millions of gold, I would freely have given the whole to have been once more with the enemy. The road in which I had to travel, was one newly opened, leading from Hubbart&s;ton to Otter|creek. The night being dark and the road ve|ry crooked, I found it very difficult to keep it; often running again&s;t trees and rocks, before I knew I was out of it; and then it was with much trouble that I found it again, which &s;ometimes I was obliged to do upon my hands and knees and often up to my knees in mire.</P>
<P>About 12 o'clock I heard &s;omething coming towards me, what it could be I knew not, I, how|ever, halted and looked back; it was &s;o dark, I was at a lo&s;s to determine what it was; but thought it looked like a dog. That a dog &s;hould be &s;o far from inhabitants, I thought very &s;trange. I at once concluded that he belonged to the Indians, and that they were not far off. I how|ever ventured to &s;peak to him, and he immedi|ately came to me; I &s;troked him and gave him a piece of my mouldy bread, which he eat and &s;oon appeared to be fond of me. At fir&s;t I
<PB N="13" REF="033740_0013_0FF8F64845F7E888">
was afraid he would betray me to the Indians; but &s;oon found him of much &s;ervice to me; for, after he came to me, I had not gone far, be|fore, I heard the noi&s;e of &s;ome wild bea&s;t. What it was, I dould not tell. I had ju&s;t &s;et down to re&s;t me, with my back again&s;t a tree, my wound being very painful. As the bea&s;t came towards me, my dog appeared very much frightened; lay clo&s;e down by me and trem|bled as if he expected to be torn in pieces. I now began to be much terrified; I however &s;et very &s;till, knowing it would do no good to run. He came within two rods of me, and &s;top|ped. I was unable to determine what it was, but &s;uppo&s;ed it was a wolf. I &s;oon found I was not mi&s;taken. After looking at me &s;ome|time, he turned about and went off; but before long returned with a large reinforcement. In his ab&s;ence I exerted my&s;elf to the utmo&s;t to get forward, fearing he would be after me a|gain. After travelling about half an hour, I was alarmed with a mo&s;t horrid howling, which I &s;uppo&s;ed to be near the tree which I re&s;ted by. Judge what my feelings were, when I found the&s;e bea&s;ts of prey were pur&s;uing me, and expecting every minute to be devoured by them. But in the mid&s;t of this trouble, to my infinite joy, I di&s;covered fires but a little way before me, which, from &s;everal circum&s;tances, I was &s;ure were not built by Indians; I there|fore at once concluded they were the fires of &s;ome &s;couting party of Americans, and I made great ha&s;te to get to them, le&s;t I &s;hould be be o|vertaken by the wolves, which were now but a
<PB N="14" REF="033740_0014_0FF8F64BB1EB4C00">
little behind. I approached &s;o near the fires as to hear men talk, when I immediately di&s;cov|ered them to be enemies. Thus di&s;appointed, I knew not what cour&s;e to take: If I continu|ed in the woods, I &s;hould be devoured by wild bea&s;ts; for having eat of the bodies which were left on the field of battle, they continued lurk|ing for more. If I gave my&s;elf up to the ene|my, I &s;hould certainly be carried back to Ti|conderoga, and from there to Canada, and pro|bably fare none the better for attempting to run away. Which way to e&s;cape I knew not; I turned a little out of the path and lay down on the ground to hear what was &s;aid by the en|emy, expecting every minute they would di&s;|cover me; the darkne&s;s of the night, however, prevented. The&s;e howling bea&s;ts approached as near the fires as they dared, when they halted and continued their horrid yell for &s;ome time, being afraid to come &s;o nigh as I was. After the howling had cea&s;ed, I began to think of get|ting round the enemy's camp; being pretty certain, that as yet, I was not di&s;covered. I a|ro&s;e from the ground and took a cour&s;e, which I thought would carry me round the enemy. After travelling a little way, I came to the foot of a high mountain; to go round it I thought would carry me too much out of my cour&s;e; I re&s;olved therefore to a&s;cend it; with much dif|ficulty I arrived at the top, then took a tack to the right; travelling that cour&s;e &s;ometime, I found I was bewildered and lo&s;t, and which way to go to find the road again I knew not, having neither moon nor &s;tars to direct me; &s;o I wan|dered
<PB N="15" REF="033740_0015_0FF8F64F36E2DB88">
about in this wilderne&s;s till almo&s;t day, when I became &s;o fatigued and worried, that I was obliged to lay down again: Judge what a per&s;ons feelings mu&s;t be in &s;uch a &s;ituation.</P>
<P>I now repented of my ever leaving the ene|my. Here I was lo&s;t in the woods with but a very little provi&s;ion, my wounds extremely painful, and, to &s;um all, little or no pro&s;pect of ever &s;eeing human beings again. Thus I lay and reflected, my dog walking round me like a faithful &s;entinel, till at length I fell a&s;leep; but was &s;oon alarmed with the noi&s;e of cannon, which I concluded by the direction mu&s;t be at Ticonderoga. Never was &s;ound more grateful to my ears than this cannon. I thought I might po&s;&s;ibly live to reach the place, and though an enemy's camp, I would have given any thing to be with them again.</P>
<P>Soon after the morning gun was &s;ired, I heard the drums beat in the camp which I had vi&s;ited in the night; this noi&s;e was &s;till more grateful, for I was now &s;ure they were not at a great di&s;|tance. With much difficulty I got on to my legs again, with a determination to go to their camp. I found however I could &s;carcely &s;tand, for having laid down when I was very &s;weaty, I had taken cold, and was &s;o &s;tiff and &s;ore, could hardly move. I now had recour&s;e to my little bottle of wine, which relieved me very much, and then began to march towards the drums, which &s;till continued beating.</P>
<P>After travelling a little way, I heard a cock crow, which appeared to be near the drums. I thought it of little con&s;equence which object to
<PB N="16" REF="033740_0016_0FF8F651A8496A60">
pur&s;ue, both being nearly in the &s;ame direction. But the noi&s;e of the drums pretty &s;oon cea&s;ed, and I &s;tared for the other object, which &s;oon brought me into open land and in &s;ight of a hou&s;e. I got to the door ju&s;t as the man aro&s;e from his bed, who met me. After the u&s;ual compliments, I a&s;ked him how far it was to the Briti&s;h encampment? He an&s;wered about fifty rods. "Do you want to go to them?" &s;ays he. I never was more at a &s;tand what reply to make. As none of the enemy were about the hou&s;e, I thought if I could per&s;uade this man to be|friend me, I po&s;&s;ibly might &s;till avoid them; but if he &s;hould prove to be a tory, and know from whence I came, he would certainly betray me. I &s;tood perhaps a minute without &s;aying a word. He &s;eeing my confu&s;ion &s;poke again to me; "Come, &s;ays he, come into the hou&s;e." I went in and &s;at down. I will tell you, &s;ays I, what I want, if you will promi&s;e not to hurt me. He replied, "I will not injure you, if you do no injury to us." This an&s;wer did not &s;ati&s;fy me, for as yet I could not tell whether he would be a friend or foe. I &s;at and viewed him for &s;ome minutes, and at-la&s;t re&s;olved to tell him from whence I came and where I wi&s;hed to go, let the event be what it would. I was a &s;oldier, &s;aid I, in the continental army, was dangerou&s;|ly wounded and taken pri&s;oner, had made my e&s;cape from the enemy, and, after much fatigue and peril, had got through the woods, being di|rected, to this hou&s;e by the crowing of a cock. He &s;miled and &s;aid, "You have been rightly directed, for had you gone to either of my
<PB N="17" REF="033740_0017_0FF8F655B06A0718">
neighbors, you undoubtedly would have been carried to the enemy again; you have now found a friend who will if po&s;&s;ible protect you. It is true they have forced me to take the oath of allegiance to the king; but I &s;incerely hope the Americans will finally prevail, for I believe their cau&s;e to be ju&s;t and equitable; &s;hould they know of my harboring rebels, as they call us, I certainly &s;hould &s;uffer for it. Any thing I can do for you without expo&s;ing my own life, I will do." I thanked him for his kindne&s;s, and de&s;ired him not to expo&s;e him&s;elf on my ac|count.</P>
<P>After giving me &s;omething to eat and drink, he concealed me in a chamber, where, he &s;aid I might &s;tay till the dew was off, and then mu&s;t go out into &s;ome &s;ecret place in the bu&s;hes, there to continue till night; this he &s;aid was nece&s;&s;ary as the enemy were often plundering about his his hou&s;e, and if I continued in it, would pro|bably be di&s;covered, which would ruin him. A little boy was &s;et as a &s;entinel at the door, who was to give notice if any of the enemy came near. I had not been in the hou&s;e half an hour, before a number of them came in, but with no other de&s;ign than to buy &s;ome rum and milk, and to borrow a pot for cooking.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they were gone, the woman came into the chamber to dre&s;s my wound. She wa&s;hed it with rum, applied dre&s;&s;ings, and bound it up as well as &s;he could. She &s;howed every mark of kindne&s;s to me; but her hu&s;band, who&s;e name was Moulton, in a day or two after I got to his hou&s;e, was pre&s;&s;ed by the enemy to bring
<PB N="18" REF="033740_0018_0FF8F65AE5E06170">
&s;tores from Skeen&s;borough with his team, and I never &s;aw the good old man any more. His wife was in much trouble, lea&s;t the enemy &s;hould find me in the hou&s;e and be &s;o enraged as to kill all the family. She permitted her little boy to guide me to the bu&s;hes, where I might &s;ecrete my&s;elf; &s;he gave me a blanket to lie on. The boy went with me to my lurking place, that I might be ea&s;ily &s;ound, &s;o as to receive refre&s;h|ment. When night came on, I was called by the boy to the hou&s;e again, and took my old &s;tand in the chamber; the woman fearing I &s;hould receive injury by lodging out of doors. She informed me that a man would lodge there that night, who was a tory, and brother-in-law to her hu&s;band; one who had actually taken arms again&s;t his country. I told her, I appre|hended danger from tarrying in the hou&s;e; &s;he &s;aid there would not be any; I then lay &s;nug in my &s;traw.</P>
<P>In a &s;hort time the tory came for &s;ome drink; the indi&s;creet woman told him &s;he had an A|merican in her chamber, who had been taken pri&s;oner by the Briti&s;h and had e&s;caped. He a&s;ked her what kind of a man I was: She told him I was a young fellow and wanted much to get home, and begged that I might not be taken back to the enemy or betrayed. His an&s;wer was very rough, and I began to think I was gone for it. I expected to be forced back; but the woman interceding &s;o hard for me, softened the ferocity of my tory enemy. Knowing I was di&s;covered, I crawled from my hiding place and began a conver&s;ation with the man. He
<PB N="19" REF="033740_0019_0FF8F65F0E6A7DA0">
a&s;ked me if I belonged to the rebel &s;ervice? I told him I belonged to the continental &s;ervice. "What is that, &s;ays he, but the rebel &s;ervice." He addre&s;&s;ed me in very in&s;olent language, and &s;aid he was very &s;orry to have me leave the king's troops in the manner I had done, and he would have me to know I was in his hands. I was patient and mild in my &s;ituation, telling him I was at his di&s;po&s;al. My good mi&s;tre&s;s often put in a word on my behalf.</P>
<P>After &s;ome time &s;pent in this way, the man a&s;ked me if he &s;hould chance to be taken, and in my power as I was in his, whether I would let him e&s;cape? I told him I &s;hould. "Then, &s;ays he, if you will promi&s;e this, I will not de|tain you; al&s;o, that if you are retaken before you reach home, you will not inform, that you have &s;een me, or been at my brothers." I gave him my promi&s;e. His advice to me was imme|diately to &s;et out, for if I &s;hould &s;tay long I might be picked up by &s;ome body or other; "And, &s;ays he, I advi&s;e you to travel in the night and hide in the day, for many volunteers are reconnoitring up and down the country." I concluded to travel; but my feeling landlady thought it be&s;t to &s;tay a few days longer. My friend tory &s;aid it was be&s;t for me to travel as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. "If you are determined to go to night, &s;aid the woman. I will dre&s;s your wound and give you food for your journey." I told her I would go as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. &s;he then dre&s;&s;ed my wound far the la&s;t time, and filled my pockets with good provi&s;ion. After thanking her for her kindne&s;s, it being all the
<PB N="20" REF="033740_0020_0FF8C14F97F09DC8">
compen&s;ation I could make, and I believe all that &s;he de&s;ired, I left her.</P>
<P>But before I proceed on my journey, I mu&s;t ju&s;t tell you, that my dog, who had accompan|ied me through many dangers, I was obliged to drive from me; when in the chamber he would commonly lay at the foot of the &s;tairs. Mrs. Moulton often told me, &s;he was afraid he would betray me, for as the enemy were often in, &s;hould they &s;ee the dog, might &s;u&s;pect that &s;omebody was in the chamber. I told her, with much regret, to drive him away; &s;he with her little boy tried all in their power to get rid of him, but in vain; the dog would &s;tay about the hou&s;e; at length &s;he called me to drive him a|way; I came down, and after much difficulty effected it.</P>
<P>But to return. After being told the cour&s;e I mu&s;t take, I began my journey in the night, which was dark and cloudy, through the woods. I had not travelled more than two hours, before I got lo&s;t. I concluded I had mi&s;&s;ed the road, and having reached the end of the one I was then in, I began to think of going back. My wound began to be very painful, and I was &s;o fore, I could &s;carcely go. While I was &s;eeking for the road again, there came up a thunder &s;hower, and rained extremely fa&s;t. I crawled into an old for&s;aken novel, which was near, and lay till the &s;hower was over; then went back a|bout half a mile and found the road once more. The road being newly opened through the woods was very bad, and it was with much dif|ficulty I could get along, often tumbling over
<PB N="21" REF="033740_0021_0FF8F66477AC51C0">
roots and &s;tones, and &s;ometimes up to my knees in mire. I once fell and was obliged to lay &s;everal minutes, before I could recover my&s;elf.</P>
<P>About twelve o'clock at night, as I was walk|ing in this wilderne&s;s, I was &s;urpri&s;ed by two large wild animals, which lay clo&s;e by the road, and &s;tarted up as &s;oon as they &s;aw me, run a &s;ew rods and turned about towards me; wheth|er they were bears or wolves, I could not tell; I was however exceedingly terrified, and would have given any thing for my dog again. One of them followed me for a long time; &s;ome|times would come clo&s;e to me, and at others, kept at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. At la&s;t, he got di&s;couraged and left me, and certainly I did not regret his ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>At day light, I came into open land, and di&s;|covered a hou&s;e belonging to Col. Meads. I was not a little rejoiced to &s;ee his hou&s;e, as I knew he would be a friend to me; but my joy was of &s;hort continuance, for as &s;oon as I look|ed into the door, I &s;aw marks of the enemy; every thing belonging to the hou&s;e being carri|ed off or de&s;troyed. I thought it not prudent to go into the hou&s;e left &s;ome of the enemy might be within; &s;o I pa&s;&s;ed on as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;i|ble; it now began to grow light, and what to do with my&s;elf I could not tell. My friends had advi&s;ed me to lay concealed in the day time and travel in the night.</P>
<P>When I viewed the depredations the enemy had made on the inhabitants, and finding many of them fled; not knowing how far I mu&s;t tra|vel to find friends, and my wound being very
<PB N="22" REF="033740_0022_0FF8C15382C99B98">
trouble &s;ome, I reflected long, whether to tarrg and be made pri&s;oner, or pu&s;h forward through a dreary wilderne&s;s; death &s;eemed to threaten me on all &s;ides; however, I collected re&s;olu|tion &s;ufficient to make to the ea&s;t; I conceived my&s;elf expo&s;ed by my uniform and bloody clothes; to prevent a di&s;covery by any who &s;hould be an enemy, I took off my &s;hirt and put it over my coat, by which my uniform was covered; in this line I marched: it being the orders of the Briti&s;h for all tories, who came to join them, to appear in this dre&s;s; I con&s;idered my&s;elf protected. I travelled till the middle of the day, before I &s;aw any per&s;on; I then met a man driving cattle, as I &s;uppo&s;ed to the enemy. He examined me clo&s;ely, and enquir|ed if I was furni&s;hed with a pa&s;s? I gave him plau&s;ible an&s;wers to all his que&s;tions, and &s;o far &s;atisfied him as to proceed unmole&s;ted. I en|quired of him, if he knew one Jo&s;hua Prie&s;t; he told me he did, and very readily directed me to the place where he lived. Leaving this man, I had not travelled far, before I met a num|ber more, armed; being within about fifty rods of them, I thought to hide my&s;elf; but found I could not: I then made towards them, with|out any apparent fear. Coming up to them, I expected a &s;trict examination; but they only a&s;ked me how far it was to &s;uch a town: I in|formed them as well as I could, and pu&s;hed on my way.</P>
<P>Being within a mile and a half of &s;aid Prie&s;t's, I &s;aw two men making towards me: They came to a &s;ence and &s;topped I heard them &s;ay, "Let's
<PB N="23" REF="033740_0023_0FF8F4C4E0FAF288">
examine this fellow, and know what his bu&s;i|ne&s;s is." One of them a&s;ked me where I was going: I told him to Jo&s;hua Prie&s;t's: He a&s;ked me my bu&s;ine&s;s there: I an&s;wered him, upon no bad errand: He &s;ays, "You are a &s;py:" I told him I was no &s;py; I did not like the fellow looks, therefore dropped the conver&s;ation with him, believing he was one of the enemy. I re|&s;olved not to conver&s;e with any one, till I had arrived at Prie&s;t's, unle&s;s compelled to. Being almo&s;t overcome with fatigue, I wi&s;hed for re&s;t; however, the&s;e men &s;eemed determined to &s;top me or do me &s;ome mi&s;chief, for when I walked on, they followed me upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and in great rage told me, I &s;hould go no farther, until I had made known to them who and what I was; &s;ay|ing, they had a&s;ked me a civil que&s;tion, and they required a civil an&s;wer. I told them if they would go to Prie&s;t's, I would tell them all the truth, and &s;atisfy them entirely, repeating to them I was no &s;py. They &s;ay they did not mean to leave me till they were <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> re&s;pec|ing me. I then, in &s;hort, told them what had be&s;el in the whole, and added, that I was well acquainted with Prie&s;t, and intended to tarry with him &s;ome time.</P>
<P>We all arrived at Prie&s;t's, who at fir&s;t did not recollect me. After &s;ome pau&s;e, he told me he was &s;urprized to &s;ee me, as my father had in|formed him I was &s;lain at Hubbard&s;ton. I told him, I was yet alive; but had received a bad wound. His family &s;oon dre&s;&s;ed my wound and made me comfortable. I then in the pre|&s;ence and hearing of my tory followers, told
<PB N="24" REF="033740_0024_0FF8F66DA68B37D0">
Prie&s;t the &s;tory of my captivity and e&s;cape, al&s;o repeated the in&s;olent language u&s;ed by the tories towards our people. When pri&s;oners with the enemy; finding Prie&s;t my friend, I &s;aid ma|ny &s;evere things again&s;t the tories, and fixed my countenance &s;ternly on tho&s;e fellows, who had pretended to lord it over me and &s;top me on my way. They bore all without &s;aying a word; but looked as <HI>&s;urly as bulls.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;oon found the&s;e tory gentry had premed|itated carrying me back, and were &s;eeking help to pro&s;ecute their de&s;ign. My friend Prie&s;t loaded his gun, and &s;aid he would give them a gri&s;t, if they dared come after me; but failing of getting any per&s;ons to join them, I was not mole&s;ted.</P>
<P>I could often hear of my tory follower's threatnings again&s;t me, to take me back, &s;aying, I &s;hould be able to &s;ight again, and do injury to the enemy. I feated the&s;e tories would do hurt; but my fears were quieted by finding the neighbors were my friends, and would afford me their protection. Put I will write no more of tory plans.</P>
<P>After being at Prie&s;t's about ten days, there came, one morning, a number of per&s;ons to &s;ee me, and appeared very friendly and much con|cerned, le&s;t I &s;hould be taken by the enemy. They informed me a man had arrived from Bur|goyne's army, and &s;aid a party of Indians was to be &s;ent forward to guard the town where I was, and protect the tories and their property; our people coming twice while I was at Prie&s;t's to take tory property. The&s;e people told me
<PB N="25" REF="033740_0025_0FF8F672850E28B0">
an hone&s;t &s;tory, and advi&s;ed me to travel imme|diately. Being de&s;irous to get home, I told my friend Prie&s;t I would not &s;tay any longer. He &s;ays, "Don't be &s;cared, I apprehend no danger from the Indians; tarry yet awhile for your wound is not healed; your are not able to tra|vel through the woods; but do as you think be&s;t." The&s;e men cried out, "E&s;cape, e&s;cape, for your life; the Indians will be upon you be|fore tomorrow night."</P>
<P>Having re&s;olved to go on, my friends fur|ni&s;hed me with provi&s;ion &s;ufficient for my jour|ney. Without doubts and fears I went on my way, and, after travelling all day, I arrived at a place called Ludlow. From this town the people all fled and left their habitations: Great was my di&s;appointment! I &s;pent the night in a melancholy manner; having neither fire nor bed to comfort my &s;hivering and impaired bo|dys.</P>
<P>About day, I &s;et out from the dreary hou&s;e, which had &s;heltered me in the night. By trav|elling, I found I had taken cold, and that my wound was very painful. De&s;ponding, I thought it be&s;t to go back about &s;even miles to &s;ome in|habitants, rather than to proceed homeward. Ju&s;t before night, I arrived <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the place of the inhabitants, &s;even miles back, who received me kindly, and took &s;pecial care of my wound.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t before &s;un&s;et of the third day after my departure, I came to my old friend Prie&s;t's a|gain, who <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">

<P>At my old friend, I &s;tayed &s;ix weeks; in the mean time my wound was almo&s;t healed. I was ho&s;pitably entertained by him.</P>
<P>Having heard that one Mr. Atwell, who be|longed to New-Marlborough, was in the neigh|borhood with a team to move a family, I agreed with him for a hor&s;e to ride. After a journey of a few days I &s;afely arrived at New-Ip&s;wich, and once <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> participated the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> my friends and acquaint|ance <HI>having <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> enemy to make me afraid.</HI></P>
