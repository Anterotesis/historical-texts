<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>THE Great God,</HI> who is the only <HI>Fountain</HI> of true <HI>Honour,</HI> has imprinted that Maje&s;ty and Beauty on true Excellency &amp; Piety, that they command E|&s;teem and Reverence from all that ob&s;erve them. And the more Eminent any are in Intellectual or Moral Perfections, the more diffu&s;ive in their Goodne&s;s; the greater Ho|nour is due to them when <HI>Living,</HI> &amp; when <HI>Dead.</HI> Such as have been Publick Benefact|ors to the World by their Worthy Deeds,

challenge the mo&s;t Publick Acknowledge|ments. And to deny their Memory this ju&s;t Tribute, will argue an heavy Imputati|on of Ingratitude and Inju&s;tice, both to God and Them. This &s;eems agreeable to the <HI>Natural Notices</HI> of what is Good and Excellent, which are ingraven on the Minds of all men.</P>
<P>Hence the <HI>Very Unletter'd Nations</HI> have had many Contrivances, &s;ome odd enough, to Eternize the Memory of their admired <HI>Hero's.</HI></P>
<P>That Part of the <HI>Heathen World,</HI> that has been <HI>better Di&s;ciplined,</HI> has always had an Honourable Regard to the Names of their Departed Friends, who either for Wi&s;dom, or Courage, or Vertue, did &s;ingularly de|&s;erve of the Publick. <HI>Funeral Panegyricks</HI> were made to Celebrate their Prai&s;e; &amp; the greate&s;t Care was u&s;ed to tran&s;mit their Names with all Marks of Honour to their <HI>Late&s;t Po&s;terity.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The People of God</HI> them&s;elves have in all Ages accounted it a part of Piety, Ju&s;tice and Charity to pay de&s;erved Re&s;pects to the Memory of Great and Good men.</P>
<P><HI>The Jews</HI> were famous for this: They were wont to prepare the Bodies of their Worthy's for their Funeral by Co&s;tly Spices,
<PB REF="001329_0004_0FB27D72035CE2B8">
Rich Odours and Perfumes. This we have an account of at the Death of <HI>A&s;a.</HI> 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 16.14. To which Cu&s;tome po&s;&s;ibly the Wi&s;e man alludes, when he tells us, <HI>A Good Name is better than precious Oyntment, Eccl.</HI> 7.1. <HI>De|cent Sepulchres</HI> were provided for their In|terment; and <HI>Funeral Elegies</HI> made in their Prai&s;e. Their Names were not mentioned without a <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing on their Memory</HI>: And a|greeably the <HI>Rabbins</HI> &s;eldome quote any Per&s;on of this Figure, but with that Form of Honourable Commemoration, <HI>viz. Such an One of Ble&s;&s;ed Memory.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Primitive Chri&s;tians</HI> accounted it no &s;mall part of their Religion, to do Suitable Honour to the Memory of their Decea&s;ed Saints, e&s;pecially <HI>Martyrs,</HI> and faithful <HI>Pa&s;t|ors.</HI> They took care that the very A&s;hes of their Martyrs &s;hould not be treated as Com|mon Du&s;t: They were wont to En&s;hrine their Remains of Mortality <HI>in Tombs,</HI> &amp; Erect Mo|numents, on which were In&s;cribed their Names, Quality and Character. <HI>Funeral O|rations</HI> were made upon them: And they had Publick Records, called their <HI>Diptychs,</HI> in which their Names were Enrolled with all Circum&s;tances of Honour. And in a lit|tle time they were prone to pay a Reverence,
<PB REF="001329_0005_0FB27D738173F2C0">
<HI>to a fault great,</HI> to the very Dormitorys of tho&s;e that Slept in Je&s;us. To be &s;ure in a few Ages they came to pay undue Honour to their Memory; which open'd the way to that <HI>Super&s;tition,</HI> and <HI>Idolatry</HI> in their Invo|cation, and Wor&s;hip of Saints, which the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> has been for many Ages Infamous for.</P>
<P>And tho' it becomes us to avoid all that was <HI>Super&s;titious,</HI> and <HI>faulty</HI> herein practi&s;ed either by Jew or Gentile, Chri&s;tian or Infi|del; yet it &s;eems agreeable to the Light of Rea&s;on &amp; Revelation to perpetuate the Me|mory of our Worthies, and to mention their Names with due Re&s;pect. The Wi&s;e man tells us, Prov. 10.7. <HI>That the Memory of the Ju&s;t &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed</HI>; i. e. <HI>&s;hall be prai&s;ed as &s;ome; or &s;hall be with prai&s;es, as others read it.</HI> And it is a <HI>Command given,</HI> Heb. 13.7. <HI>Remember them that have the Rule over you, who have &s;poken to you the Word of God, who&s;e faith follow, con&s;idering the end of their Con|ver&s;ation. Indeed</HI> a great care is nece&s;&s;ary that in all the Prai&s;es we give to departed Saints, we ultimately re&s;pect the Glory of God, who was the <HI>Giver</HI> of all their Valuable Endowments: Their Worthy Actions mu&s;t be &s;et forth in a manner &s;uitable, and with a
<PB REF="001329_0006_0FB27D7A72036FB0">
ju&s;t de&s;ign, to incite the <HI>Living</HI> to an Honou|rable Imitation of them. And thus there will be no real Incon&s;i&s;tency, but an admira|ble Harmony, between <HI>Prai&s;ing the Dead,</HI> &amp; <HI>In&s;tructing the Living.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot therefore but think that I have done but my Duty, what Chri&s;tianity allows, &amp; In|vites to, in giving &s;ome Account of the Gifts &amp; Graces of that Excellent Per&s;on, who was late|ly Serving God, and the Intere&s;t of this Con|gregation here below; but is now giving his Attendance on the Throne of the Lamb Above: And am per&s;waded it may be many ways ad|vantageous, e&s;pecially to this Flock of Chri&s;t; to gratify the de&s;ires of many, by a Publication of what of his Character was deliver'd in the following Sermon, in which I have the &s;atis|faction to have &s;aid <HI>Le&s;s,</HI> than I am fully per|&s;waded, was his <HI>Due.</HI> And &s;ure I am, this &s;hort account of this Servant of God may, thro' the Ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven, be of con&s;iderable Service to us, that have &s;o long Sat under his Shadow, and have had our Souls, if not our own fault, often refre&s;hed with his Di&s;pen&s;ations.</P>
<P>The <HI>Great</HI> &amp; <HI>Good</HI> things that are ju&s;tly &s;po|ken of him, &s;hould lead us to magnify Chri&s;t the <HI>Fountain</HI> from whence all his Accompli&s;h|ments were derived; and teach us what Hon|our is due to God in whom all Perfections do Concenter. They tend to in&s;pire us with Gra|titude

to Heaven for the be&s;towment of &s;o <HI>Rich</HI> a <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> on us, and for the Continuance of the &s;ame for &s;o long a &s;ea&s;on; and &s;o to breathe in|to us the <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>Temper</HI> of Holy <HI>Bernard,</HI> who on the Death of his Brother <HI>Gerard</HI> broke out into that flight:
<Q>Lord, Thou ha&s;t given, and Thou ha&s;t taken away; tho' we grieve that Thou ha&s;t Taken away, yet we cannot forget that Thou did&s;t give him.</Q>
His <HI>Character</HI> may Excite us to a &s;trict Examination of our &s;elves, whether our Im|provement of &s;o great a Ble&s;&s;ing has been pro|portionable to our advantages, which hereby have been &s;ingular; and may lead us to a &s;o|lemn Con&s;ideration of that <HI>Awful Account</HI> we have to give up to God of &s;o <HI>Rich a Price</HI> we have had in our hands; &amp; how Speechle&s;s we &s;hall be found if at the la&s;t we appear Strangers to <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and his <HI>Holine&s;s.</HI> It may &s;erve to pro|mote our Humiliation, and Repentance for our pa&s;t barrenne&s;s under &s;uch Manuring, as Hea|ven has afforded us, by the Care, Wi&s;dom and Fidelity of This his Servant: It may direct our Endeavours after, and Prayers for a <HI>Succe&s;&s;or,</HI> that may Enjoy a double Portion of his Gifts and Graces, to fit him to Stand in the Gap that is made in our Hedge. In a word, it may ani|mate us to a due Imitation of his Holy Exam|ple, and to a ju&s;t value for, and holy Improve|ment of what of his WORKS are left in our Hands, by which tho' DEAD, He yet Speak|eth aloud to us.</P>

<P><PB REF="001329_0011_0FB27D8583625928">Let us Labour to lay a good Foundation of <HI>Chri&s;tian Knowledge,</HI> as the foundation of Practi|cal Religion.

This Knowledge we mu&s;t Endeavour to get, and improve in: which is ne|ce&s;&s;ary both to Truth and Growth in Grace.

<HEAD>A Funeral SERMON On that Learned and Excellent DIVINE The Reverend Mr. SAMUEL WILLARD&punc;</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>Matthew XXIV.45, 46.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Who then is a faithful and wi&s;e Servant whom his Lord hath made Ruler over his Hou&s;|hold, to give them meat in due &s;ea&s;on?</P>
<P>Ble&s;&s;ed is that Servant, whom his Lord when he cometh &s;hall find &s;o doing.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the Conclu&s;ion of the former Chapter, our Lord-Redeemer entertains his Di&s;|ciples with a <HI>Praediction</HI> of tho&s;e De&s;o|lations, that were coming upon the Jew|i&s;h Nation; In the final De&s;truction of their <HI>City</HI> and <HI>Temple,</HI> their <HI>Polity</HI> and <HI>Wor&s;hip</HI>; in which He would appear in the vi&s;ible ter|rors of his Wrath, and the Triumphs of his Pow|er
<PB N="2" REF="001329_0017_0FB27D9C39E0F888">
and Ju&s;tice: and is therefore &s;tiled his <HI>Com|ing.</HI> Upon this Praediction his Di&s;ciples came to Him as He &s;at on the Mount of <HI>Olives,</HI> and put two Queries to Him, <HI>viz. When &s;hall the&s;e things be?</HI> i. e When will the final Ruin of <HI>Je|ru&s;alem</HI> Commence? The other Enquiry was, <HI>What &s;hall be the &s;ign of thy Coming, and of the End of the World</HI>? This I under&s;tand to be di&s;tinct from the former; and to refer to the <HI>Final Judg|ment.</HI> The rea&s;on why the Di&s;ciples joyn the&s;e two Queries together, may be this, <HI>viz.</HI> They had haply Entertained that Mi&s;take, which prevailed in that day, that the End of the World, or Final Judgment, would either Syn|chroni&s;e with, or immediately follow upon, <HI>Je|ru&s;alems</HI> De&s;truction. Our Saviour returns an An&s;wer to both the&s;e Que&s;tions; which tho' not fitted to gratify their Curio&s;ity, yet was wi&s;ely adapted to promote their praeparation for the&s;e his Awful Appearances. He particu|larly acquaints them with &s;ome of the infalli|ble Progno&s;ticks and Fore-runners of his Ap|pearance in the Clouds of Heaven, to Judge the <HI>Quick</HI> and <HI>Dead.</HI> For I can by no means per&s;wade my &s;elf to &s;ub&s;cribe the Opinion of &s;ome <NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><HI>Grotius,</HI> Dr. <HI>Hammond.</HI></NOTE> Criticks of no common figure in the Learned World, who look upon the whole of our Saviours Di&s;cour&s;e in this Chapter, to look no further than the De&s;truction of <HI>Jeru&s;a|lem</HI>: But mu&s;t think that a great part of this
<PB N="3" REF="001329_0018_0FB27D9E493139C8">
Di&s;cour&s;e has a principal a&s;pect upon the Fi|nal Judgment. Now Chri&s;t applies the Doct|rine of this his Per&s;onal Appearance to Judge the World, to Engage them to greater diligence and watchfulne&s;s, in their preparation to meet Him, when He &s;hall be revealed from Heaven in flaming fire, and with the Retinue of Migh|ty Angels. This their preparation He further Excites them to, from two Con&s;iderations, the <HI>Suddenne&s;s</HI> of his Appearance, and the certain <HI>Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s</HI> of &s;uch as &s;hall be found diligent and faithful in their Ma&s;ters Work at his Coming&punc; The latter of which Arguments is contained in our Text. The words read, tho' in their ge|neral &s;cope are applicable to all Believers; yet nextly and peculiarly they belong to Chri&s;t's Faithful Mini&s;ters; who are in an ap|propriate &s;en&s;e the Servants of his Hou&s;e, the Stewards of his Family, and the Shepherds of his Flock. In them we may ob&s;erve two prin|cipal parts.</P>
<P N="1">1. We have the Character of a true Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter; which is drawn.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) From his Relation to Chri&s;t. He is Chri&s;t's <HI>Servant,</HI> and Chri&s;t is his Lord. And every Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter is his Servant, not only by the common profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity, but &s;pecial de&s;ignation; by their particular as well as general Calling.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) From his Work, <HI>i. e.</HI> to <HI>Rule</HI> and <HI>Feed</HI> Chri&s;t's Hou&s;hold&punc; this is E&s;&s;ential to the Of|fice
<PB N="4" REF="001329_0019_0FB27D9FCF1EBE28">
of a Steward in a Family, to a&s;&s;ign to eve|ry Servant his Work and Provi&s;ion. He has the Care and Order of the other Servants com|mitted to him. The Church is Chri&s;t's own Hou&s;e, the Hou&s;hold of Faith; and this mu&s;t be cared for: fed with the Word and Bread of Life; govern'd &amp; order'd according to Chri&s;t's In&s;titutions, who is the Great LORD of the Hou&s;hold.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) From tho&s;e Vertues and Endowments which qualifie him for his Po&s;t, and which are to be Exerci&s;ed in the di&s;charge of the Duties thereof, <HI>viz. Fidelity</HI> and <HI>Wi&s;dom.</HI> He mu&s;t be a <HI>Faithful</HI> and <HI>Wi&s;e</HI> Servant; faithful to keep the charge and tru&s;t committed to him; and wi&s;e to di&s;charge it in the be&s;t manner, &s;o as be&s;t to &s;erve the end of it; the Good of Chri&s;t's Family, and the Honour of the Great Ma&s;ter of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. We have the reward of that Servant, who is wi&s;e and faithful in the Service a&s;&s;igned him. He &s;hall be <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed</HI> when his Lord comes; which undoubtedly intends not barely that he &s;hall obtain true ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, but an <HI>Eminent degree</HI> thereof, in proportion to his wi&s;dom and fi|delity.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not Endeavour to gra&s;p all the&s;e things into one Doctrine; But &s;hall con&s;ider them di|&s;tinctly in that order in which they have been ob&s;erved to lie in our Text. So that there are the&s;e four things to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="5" REF="001329_0020_0FB27DA179F5D078">1. The Relation that a Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter bears to Chri&s;t, He is his <HI>Servant.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The Work incumbent on him, to <HI>Feed</HI> and <HI>Rule</HI> Chri&s;t's Flock.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Virtues and Endowments that are ne|ce&s;&s;ary to the true di&s;charge of this Work. <HI>Fi|delity</HI> and <HI>Wi&s;dom.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>Di&s;tingui&s;hing</HI> Reward, that &s;hall be given unto him, by his Lord at his Coming.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> We are to Con&s;ider the Relation that an Evangelical Pa&s;tor &s;tands in to Chri&s;t: He is the Servant of Chri&s;t. The Great Doctor of the Gentiles glories in this Relation, and challenges the acknowledgment of it from others, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.1. <HI>Let a man account of us as the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, &amp; the Stewards of the My&s;teries of God.</HI> The Honour of this Relation belongs not only to the Exalted Station of an Apo&s;tle; but to the meane&s;t in the Sacred Function in the Succe&s;&s;ive Ages of the Church.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be acknowledged that there are &s;eve|ral Wayes in which Men, and other Creatures, may truely come under this Denomination. By <HI>Creation,</HI> all Creatures are his Servants: For He is Lord of Heaven and Earth: He has an unalienable Propriety in, and an ab&s;olute Su|preamacy over all Creatures therein, as they are the Works of his hands. Subjection to his Go|vernment well becomes the State of the highe&s;t Order of Created Beings. The bright Angels.
<PB N="6" REF="001329_0021_0FB27DA3817D4190">
of Light, who Excel in Strength, are at his Command, and obey his Will. He &s;tands at the Head of the Lower Creation, and leads forth Creatures Animate, &amp; Inanimate to Serve him, at his Plea&s;ure. The Sun, Moon, and Stars in their Cour&s;es; Stormy Wind, Hail, Snow and Vapour, in their places are under his Command, and fulfill his Will. Thus all men as they are the Creatures of God, are his Servants. He &s;pake the Word, and we Started into Being at his Cre|ating Call: <HI>He made us, and not we our &s;elves; Let us come before the Lord our Maker, and give him the Glory due to his Name.</HI></P>
<P>All profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians are his Servants by <HI>External Vocation</HI>; vi&s;ible <HI>Dedication,</HI> and &s;olemn <HI>Stipulation.</HI> In Bapti&s;m we are openly con&s;e|crated to the Service of the Living JEHOVAH: And did &s;olemnly renounce all other Service, unle&s;s in Subordination to Chri&s;t: And &s;o we &s;tand obliged to Chri&s;t as our Ma&s;ter by our own free Con&s;ent and Compact; to which Heaven and Earth are Witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>All Believers are the Servants of Chri&s;t by <HI>Redemption,</HI> and the UNCTION of the HOLY ONE. They are not their Own, for they are bought with a price, their Spirits and Bodies are his Propriety. He has formed them for him&s;elf; and their Ears are bored to the Po&s;ts of his Door. And the&s;e are of his Family.</P>
<P>But in a more <HI>Appropriate Sence,</HI> Evangelical Pa&s;tors are the Servants of Chri&s;t's Family, by a peculiar Separation to Special Service;
<PB N="7" REF="001329_0022_0FB27DAA96DA1900">
by which they are di&s;tingui&s;hed not only from the World, but from the re&s;t of Chri&s;ts own Hou&s;hold. By a &s;pecial <HI>Deputation</HI> He has Set them over his hou&s;e; He has given them a Commi&s;&s;ion to repre&s;ent his Per&s;on, and Prae|&s;ide under him in the great Affairs of his Vi&s;ible Kingdom, Wor&s;hip and Service. To be &s;epa|rated to the Work of the Go&s;pel is not the pe|culiar priviledge of an Apo&s;tle, but common to every ordinary Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter. Chri&s;t has not left the Work of his Hou&s;e in <HI>Common,</HI> but has drawn a Sacred <HI>Inclo&s;ure</HI> about it, to keep out vain pretenders, that would take this Honour to them&s;elves. A <HI>Liberty</HI> of <HI>Prophe&s;ying,</HI> as a&s;&s;erted by &s;ome, is indeed but a liberty to overturn the Order of the Go&s;pel. All are intruders, and guilty of an Inva&s;ion upon the Sacred Office of the Mini&s;try, that have not their <HI>Mi&s;&s;ion</HI> from Chri&s;t. For how &s;hall they Preach unle&s;s they be &s;ent? And who &s;hall &s;end them but Chri&s;t who&s;e Amba&s;&s;adors they are? No man taketh this Honour to him&s;elf, but he that is Called as was <HI>Aaron.</HI> This authority the Apo&s;tles, who were the fir&s;t Heralds of the Everla&s;ting Go&s;pel, were immediately by Chri&s;t inve&s;ted with: But this is mediately communicated to Chri&s;ts ordi|nary Mini&s;ters, as their Succe&s;&s;ors. And the&s;e are not <HI>of men,</HI> tho' they are <HI>by men,</HI> by whom they are authori&s;ed to di&s;pen&s;e the Un&s;earchable riches of Chri&s;t. Their <HI>Me&s;&s;age</HI> they receive from Chri&s;t, who&s;e Me&s;&s;engers they are. Their
<PB N="8" REF="001329_0023_0FB27DAD23CC8530">
&s;olemn <HI>Charge</HI> is given in his Name, and by his Authority they act. Agreeable hereto the El|ders of <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> tho' appointed by an ordinary Call, are &s;aid to be made <HI>Over&s;eers</HI> of <HI>the Flock</HI> by <HI>the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> the Spirit of Chri&s;t, <HI>Act.</HI> 20.28. And none but &s;uch can Admini&s;ter the Word and Sacraments with Authority, or a rea|&s;onable pro&s;pect of Succe&s;s. The Service that every Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter is Engaged in has an im|mediate re&s;pect to Chri&s;t: He a&s;&s;igns them their Work: Of his Revenue they are Maintained; and to him they mu&s;t finally give up an account. Thus in a peculiar &s;ence they are the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t; and only the Servants of their People for Chri&s;ts &s;ake. They are the <HI>Stewards</HI> of his Hou&s;hold; <HI>Labourers</HI> in his Vineyard &amp; Harve&s;t; Who&s;e Province is to Sow, Plant, Cultivate and Manure the Soil of the Church, that Garden of Chri&s;t. And this their Relation to Chri&s;t tells us that their <HI>Station</HI> is high and honourable; their <HI>Charge</HI> mo&s;t important; and their <HI>Account</HI> awful: That to contemn, in&s;ult, and outrage their Character, will be interpreted as an in&s;uf|ferable Indignity offer'd to Chri&s;t him&s;elf; and that their <HI>Ma&s;ter will highly re&s;ent it as &s;uch.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> In the Second place we are to Con&s;ider the <HI>Work</HI> of Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters. The relation of Servants nece&s;&s;arily infers Work, and Service for their Lord. And the &s;pecial Service, which they are called to, is to <HI>Feed, Rule</HI> and <HI>Order Chri&s;ts Fa|mily.</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="001329_0024_0FB27DAE0D6F9EF8">
They are <HI>Rulers</HI> over his <HI>Hou&s;hold</HI> to give them their <HI>Meat</HI> in due Sea&s;on. How honoura|ble is their Work! How difficult their Po&s;t, and the Service thereof! The dignity of their Sta|tion and Employment would well become the Excellency, and its difficulty requires the power, purity, and activity of the Highe&s;t Angels, that incircle the Throne of God. Their Work con|&s;i&s;ts of two parts, and we may Con&s;ider them di&s;tinctly.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Work of an Evangelical Mini&s;ter is to <HI>Feed Chri&s;t's Family.</HI> Chri&s;t's Flock mu&s;t be fed, and his Hou&s;hold mu&s;t have &s;uitable Pro|vi&s;ion made for them. And this by Office be|longs to Chri&s;t's Servants, to whom he has com|mitted the Word of Reconciliation. The&s;e are under the mo&s;t Solemn Obligations, and awful charge to take care of this; as they would not be found Idle Shepherds, Slothful Servants, and Unfaithful Stewards, by their Lord <HI>at His Coming</HI>; and be Animadverted on as &s;uch. What Chri&s;t pathetically inculcates upon <HI>Peter,</HI> has a re&s;pect to all the Me&s;&s;engers of Peace, <HI>John</HI> 21.15, 16, 17. Simon Son of Jonas love&s;t thou me more than the&s;e? &mdash; <HI>Feed my Lambs&mdash; Feed my Sheep&mdash; Feed my Sheep.</HI> The &s;ame addre&s;s He makes to every Pa&s;tor with the like Expre&s;&s;ions of En|dearment. This therefore is a principal, and e&s;&s;ential part of their Office Work, to give the other Servants of God's Family their Food.</P>
<P>This Food mu&s;t be Spiritual: Such a Provi|&s;ion
<PB N="10" REF="001329_0025_0FB27DB02409C4E0">
as may be a proper Entertainment for the Soul: as may be &s;uited to the Nature, Nece&s;&s;i|ties, Spiritual Appetite, and Cravings of an Im|mortal Spirit, As bodily Food does an&s;wer the wants of the Body. Proper Food is <HI>Pabulum Vitae.</HI> It is nece&s;&s;ary to the pre&s;ervation, growth and nouri&s;hment of the outward man: It is &s;uita|ble in its nature and de&s;ign, to confirm and en|crea&s;e the &s;trength and health of the Body: To repair the decayes of Nature, and maintain it in a due Temperature and di&s;po&s;ition to di&s;|charge the proper functions of life. Now in <HI>Analogy</HI> to this: Spiritual Food is whatever tends to beget, maintain and improve the true &s;piritual life of man. To nouri&s;h the Soul with Divine Knowledge, which is the proper food of the Under&s;tanding; to beget and &s;trength|en, to encrea&s;e and nouri&s;h the Divine Princi|ples of Grace and Vertue in the heart; to ad|vance the Soul from one degree of Vertue to another; from it's Infant to a more virile State; To re&s;tore it from it's decayes and &s;pi|ritual langui&s;hments to an athletick and healthy Condition; This is to afford it &s;uitable food. And this is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Stewards of Go&s;pel My&s;teries. Chri&s;t &s;ends his Servants on this very Errand to open blind eyes, to &s;often hard Hearts, to awaken &s;ecure Con&s;ciences, and Edify the Body of Chri&s;t. And to feed Chri&s;t's Flock is to in&s;truct their ignorance, in|lighten their darkne&s;s, to nouri&s;h them with
<PB N="11" REF="001329_0026_0FB27DB15112BE28">
&s;piritual wi&s;dom and vertue; to u&s;e proper methods to render their knowledge productive of an Heavenly Conver&s;ation, and to turn the principles of Truth into living principles of Action: It is to heal the wounded &s;pirit, to com|fort the Di&s;con&s;olate, to rai&s;e up the Dejected, to encourage the Fearful, confirm the Waver|ing, reduce the Straying, to &s;pur up the Loyte|ring, and &s;trengthen the Weak, that they may advance to higher degrees of the Divine Na|ture and Life. The Servants of Chri&s;t cannot indeed by any vertue of their own, or by the proper force of their Di&s;pen&s;ations convey life and &s;trength to the Soul: <HI>Paul may plant, and Apollos water, but God gives the increa&s;e</HI>: He ble&s;|&s;es Zion's <HI>Provi&s;ion,</HI> and cloaths her <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> with Salvation. They therefore are &s;aid to feed Chri&s;t's Family, when they u&s;e the Means Or|dained for their Spiritual Nouri&s;hment. Now there are &s;everal Duties, in the di&s;charge where|of, this food and nouri&s;hment is to be afforded to a People.</P>
<P>To this end the Word of Truth mu&s;t be di&s;|pen&s;ed, and applyed. In which the my&s;terious methods of <HI>Divine Wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>Grace</HI> mu&s;t be di&s;play'd, and unfolded: By this the knowledge of God and Chri&s;t is to be propagated, whom to know is Life Eternal. The <HI>Preaching of the Go&s;pel</HI> is a wi&s;e and conde&s;cending method in which Chri&s;t is plea&s;ed to carry on a Treaty of Peace with Rebel Sinners. It is a proper
<PB N="12" REF="001329_0027_0FB27DB8373ADAE0">
Remedy for the &s;piritual ignorance and blind|ne&s;s, the forgetfulne&s;s and incon&s;ideratene&s;s of men. It is admirably adapted to rouze the &s;e|cure and &s;tupid out of their Spiritual Lethargy; to convince them of their &s;in and mi&s;ery; to turn them from the Error of their wayes, and transform them into the Image of Divine Purity. It is fitted to build up Saints in Faith, Holine&s;s and Comfort. Agreeably we have this Enco|mium given of this Word of Grace, the Di&s;|pen&s;ation whereof is committed to the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try: 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.15, 16. It is able to make Wi&s;e to Salvation: <HI>It is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for In&s;truction in Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> This is the <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. 4.15.</NOTE> good Seed by which Sinners are begotten, and tran&s;lated into the Kingdom of Light and Grace. By this Saints are <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. 2.2&punc;</NOTE> nou|ri&s;hed, and made to thrive in all the di&s;po&s;itions of Holine&s;s. In this the Wells of Salvation are open'd, whence the di&s;con&s;olate may draw Wa|ter with Joy. And in the right di&s;pen&s;ation of this the Servants of Chri&s;t are helpers of the Believers Joy <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 1.24.</NOTE>. This Word they are oblig'd to di&s;pen&s;e as they have Opportunity in their Private Applications to their People; and in the Publick Service of Gods hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Again, they are to Feed the Hou&s;hold of Chri&s;t by a due Admini&s;tration of the <HI>Seals</HI> of

<P>By a due Admini&s;tration al&s;o of the <HI>Sacrament</HI> of the <HI>Lords Supper</HI> the&s;e Shepherds are to Feed the <HI>Flock</HI> of Chri&s;t.

<PB N="39" REF="001329_0054_0FB27E009490B5A0">
at a few <HI>Cardinal points,</HI> to which Mini&s;terial Prudence mu&s;t always have re&s;pect, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Mini&s;terial Wi&s;dom</HI> mu&s;t be Exerci&s;ed in a &s;uitable Care and Caution not to <HI>Expo&s;e</HI> their <HI>Character</HI> to Contempt. There is a ju&s;t <HI>Reverence</HI> due to the Character of God's Amba&s;&s;adors, which cannot be lo&s;t without Evident dammage to their Ma&s;ters Service. Few People are &s;o <HI>Metaphy&s;ical</HI> as to ab&s;tract the <HI>Calling</HI> from the <HI>Per&s;on:</HI> to contemn the Per&s;on of a Mini&s;ter &amp; yet reverence his Office. It mu&s;t be allowed therefore as a &s;tanding Maxim of Wi&s;dom, that Mini&s;ters mu&s;t be careful to Maintain that Re|verence, which is due to them for their Work &s;ake. Indeed many times Vile and Profligate men will load them with contempt tho they are never &s;o circum&s;pect: Their very Character is enough to Expo&s;e them to the &s;corn and banter of &s;ome, who&s;e Vices have &s;unk them below the vile&s;t parts of the Creation, who are lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of what is virtuous, good and &s;acred&punc; But they mu&s;t be careful not to de&s;erve &s;uch rude treatment. That by their fooli&s;h anguard|ed Conver&s;ation, they do not invite the Profane to ridicule and in&s;ult them. And it mu&s;t be ac|knowledged that they are the Criminal Occa|&s;ions too often of that Contempt and Indignity which is ca&s;t on them. Hence we have that ad|vice given to <HI>Titus,</HI> and to every Mini&s;ter in him, Tit. 2.15. <HI>Let no man de&s;pi&s;e thee.</HI> Which Pre|cept mu&s;t be ob&s;erved by avoiding every thing
<PB N="40" REF="001329_0055_0FB27E0218A5FF60">
that will make them appear <HI>Vile, Mean</HI> &amp; <HI>Little</HI> in the eye of the World. And this Prudence is to be &s;een in.</P>
<P>To this End Prudence directs and requires Mini&s;ters to avoid <HI>Vice</HI> and <HI>Immorality.</HI> For this will wound the be&s;t Reputation, and Expo&s;e to Contempt. And renders the&s;e Servants of God in a peculiar manner <HI>Vile.</HI> Thus <HI>Eli</HI>'s Sons ren|dred them&s;elves <HI>Vile.</HI> This will darken the LIGHTS of the World; and render the SALT of the Earth in&s;ipid; and no Wonder then they are of no Account.</P>
<P>To this End they mu&s;t take heed of <HI>Ignorance.</HI> Knowledge is a good Medium to pre&s;eve their Character; but Ignorance will render them con|temptible in the Eyes of Good and Bad. This may &s;ometimes be from want of Natural Abili|ties; and the defects of Nature are not to be <HI>Expo&s;ed,</HI> but <HI>Pitied.</HI> But this defect &s;hould keep them from invading that Office, where Know|ledge is nece&s;&s;ary; and Ignorance challenges Contempt, being Expo&s;ed to open view. There is good in&s;truction in that Admonition that dropt from a Witty Pen,
<Q>If Owls would not be hooted at, let them keep clo&s;e within the Tree, and not Perch upon the upper bows.</Q></P>
<P>Again, To this End Wi&s;dom directs to avoid every thing that will argue a <HI>Servility</HI> of <HI>Temper</HI>: All Sordid Complyances with men of Corrupt Affections. They mu&s;t take heed not to u&s;e any mean Acts of flattery to in&s;inuate them&s;elves into

the favour of Men. They mu&s;t not &s;toop to any thing below the Dignity of their Station, to gain the E&s;teem of the World. All Methods of <HI>Di&s;&s;imulation</HI> and <HI>Flattery</HI> argue a mean and lit|tle Spirit, which is the proper object of Contempt. Thus they mu&s;t Watch again&s;t every thing that is contrary to true <HI>Genero&s;ity,</HI> or <HI>Greatne&s;s</HI> of Soul&punc; which &s;hould appear in their whole Deport|ment; and which will make them <HI>Venerable</HI> in the Eyes of the World.

<P>To this End they mu&s;t be careful not to go to the <HI>Utmo&s;t Limits</HI> of what is Lawful.

Some things are <HI>E&s;&s;ential</HI> and <HI>Fundamental,</HI> without which neither Grace here, nor Glory hereafter can be Expected; other things are <HI>Circum&s;tantial</HI>: Some things are Du|ties by <HI>Divine In&s;titution,</HI> other things are &s;o on|ly from <HI>Principles</HI> of <HI>meer Prudence</HI>: Some things are the <HI>Weightier Matters of the Law,</HI> other things are but as the <HI>Tithings of Mint &amp; Cummin</HI>: Some are <HI>Gnaws,</HI> others <HI>Camels</HI>&punc; Some are <HI>Moats,</HI> and others <HI>Beams,</HI> as our Saviour calls them: Some are indi&s;pen&s;ibly <HI>Nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> other things are <HI>Ex|pedient Pro hic ad nunc.</HI> And mo&s;t frequently the Moral denomination of Actions, and e&s;peci|ally as to their degree, does depend upon cir|cum&s;tances, which are Variable. Now Wi&s;dom mu&s;t di&s;cern between the&s;e, and the judgment
<PB N="43" REF="001329_0058_0FB27E0DC1343A40">
mu&s;t conclude and determine accordingly. For things mu&s;t be pre&s;&s;ed, in&s;i&s;ted on in pro|portion to their nece&s;&s;ity and excellency. The want of Prudence to make this judgment, is many times highly prejudicial to the Work of the Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>Again, there mu&s;t be a right judgment of <HI>Per&s;ons.</HI> Without this they can never divide e|very one his <HI>Portion</HI> aright. All <HI>re&s;pect to Per&s;ons</HI> is not a <HI>Criminal Partiality</HI>; but there is a con&s;i|deration of <HI>Per&s;ons,</HI> and a di&s;tingui&s;hing regard to them, which will argue no common Wi&s;dom in the di&s;charge of their Pa&s;toral Care. There is a great difference in the <HI>Tempers</HI> of <HI>Per&s;ons</HI> to be treated with; nay a great variety is ob&s;erva|ble in the <HI>Frames</HI> and <HI>Di&s;po&s;itions</HI> of the &s;ame Per&s;on at different Sea&s;ons. That addre&s;s that may be &s;uitable to Melt one, may Exa&s;perate another; that, which may be fit to <HI>Gain</HI> a man at one time, may have a tendency to <HI>Alienate</HI> him at another, and to fill him with prejudice again&s;t the Truth. Every man has &s;ome <HI>Qua|lity,</HI> that renders him <HI>Acce&s;&s;able,</HI> and capable of per&s;wa&s;ion, which if under&s;tood and wi&s;ely ad|dre&s;&s;ed would afford an happy pro&s;pect of Suc|ce&s;s. And tho' Religion will not allow Mini|&s;ters to gratify the Vitious humours of men, yet Wi&s;dom requires that care be taken to improve their tempers to the be&s;t advantage, to recover them from the Error of their Wayes. Wi&s;dom requires a <HI>Di&s;tinction</HI> to be made between the&s;e
<PB N="44" REF="001329_0059_0FB27E0EC7E81028">

<P>There is a difference to be ob&s;erved between the <HI>Civil Characters</HI> of men, which Mini&s;terial Wi&s;dom directs to a due care not to make a breach upon in treating with them. They are not to be &s;oothed up in any Evil wayes; Sin mu&s;t not be &s;uffer'd to ly upon the&s;e; the Rich and High are to be charged in the Name of Chri&s;t to perform the Duties, and &s;hun the Sins, of their Station; their Sins are to be reproved&punc; but Prudence directs that all this be done in a way con&s;i&s;tent with that di&s;tinction that Provi|dence has made. <HI>Nathan</HI> in reproving <HI>David</HI> has Set Mini&s;ters a Pattern to Write after. Su|periors mu&s;t not be in&s;ulted, nor expo&s;ed to the
<PB N="45" REF="001329_0060_0FB27E111FE28D48">
Contempt of tho&s;e that are under them: The reproofs given them mu&s;t not be <HI>Satyr</HI> which will Sting, but &s;uch Wi&s;e <HI>Remon&s;trance</HI> of their reproveable Actions, as &s;hall at once convince of their own Error, and the re&s;pect and love of him that makes it.</P>
<P>Again, Wi&s;dom requires a right <HI>Di&s;cerning</HI> of <HI>Times,</HI> and to act according to a true judgment of them. It is the Character of the Wi&s;e man, <HI>That his heart di&s;cerneth time and judgment,</HI> Eccle&s;. 8.5. One &s;ea&s;on may afford an happy Conjun|ction of favourable Circum&s;tances, which may promi&s;e Chri&s;t's Mini&s;ters greater &s;ucce&s;s in one part of their work, than another &s;ea&s;on may. Now a <HI>Word &s;poken in &s;ea&s;on</HI> has its peculiar <HI>beau|ty</HI> and <HI>advantage.</HI> Mini&s;ters are not to be <HI>Time-&s;ervers</HI> to promote their own &s;ecular de&s;igns; but they mu&s;t be <HI>Time-&s;ervers</HI> in &s;uiting their Di&s;pen&s;ations to the advantages that every &s;ea|&s;on may peculiarly afford them to do good to Souls. A word &s;ea&s;onable at one time may not be &s;o at another. Providences which are vari|ous, call for that at one time, which they do not at another. And Wi&s;dom obliges to a right Con&s;ideration, and Application proper to a day of Adver&s;ity, and to what is proper for a day of Pro&s;perity. There are <HI>Truths of the day</HI> to be open'd and defended; <HI>Errors of the day</HI> to be de|tected and confuted; <HI>Sins of the day</HI> to be Wit|ne&s;&s;ed again&s;t. And Prudence directs the Ser|vants of God to a regard to the&s;e. There are

&s;ome Sea&s;ons more proper than others to treat with the &s;ame Per&s;ons; and the&s;e mu&s;t be watch'd for, and improved.

<P N="3">3. <HI>Prudence</HI> mu&s;t <HI>temper, regulate and proportion the expre&s;&s;ions of their Zeal.</HI> Zeal is a Grace ne|ce&s;&s;ary to every Chri&s;tian; and is required to an Eminent degree of tho&s;e that <HI>watch for Souls.</HI> The&s;e are &s;tiled <HI>Angels,</HI> who are <HI>Flames of Fire</HI>: They are to be like them in a warm Indignati|on again&s;t Sin, in a burning love to Chri&s;t and Immortal Souls, and in holy ardours in the Ser|vice of God. Lukewarmne&s;s and indifferency of &s;pirit in the Cau&s;e of Chri&s;t, and of peri&s;h|ing Souls, will be a reproach to their Work, and Ma&s;ter; and tends to make Sinners indif|ferent and carele&s;s about the great intere&s;t of Eternity: whereas a well regulated zeal in the Advocates for God and Souls, will be a proper medium to make Sinners <HI>in earne&s;t</HI> in working out their own Salvation. But all is not true zeal that men call &s;o; what many times a&s;&s;umes the name is but a degenerate pa&s;&s;ion, a fury rai&s;ed in their own cau&s;e, and not in Gods: It
<PB N="47" REF="001329_0062_0FB27E1641AEDCC8">
is a fire indeed, but an unhallowed one, not kindled at Gods Altar, that neither came from Heaven, nor a&s;cends thither. It is therefore requi&s;ite that this affection be under an holy Goverment; which mu&s;t be managed by that true wi&s;dom <HI>that comes from Above.</HI> Prudence mu&s;t direct it to a <HI>Right Object</HI>; for without that it will be a zeal not according to knowledge: the matter of it mu&s;t be good; it mu&s;t be pla|ced upon true <HI>Catholick Chri&s;tianity</HI>; and not on the <HI>Religion of a Party.</HI> It mu&s;t be founded up|on right and durable <HI>Principles,</HI> which right Rea|&s;on, and the Holy Word of God will ju&s;tifie; and not built upon unaccountable <HI>Impul&s;es,</HI> nor de&s;igned to &s;erve the Intere&s;ts of any particular party; <HI>Prudence here is profitable to direct.</HI></P>
<P>Again, Wi&s;dom will &s;ee that it be exerci&s;ed in ways con&s;i&s;tent with Charity and Chri&s;ti|an Compa&s;&s;ion; and not with the corrupt fer|ment of wrath and bitterne&s;s to the per&s;ons of any. It mu&s;t al&s;o <HI>Regulate the Mea&s;ure</HI> and de|gree of this affection. It mu&s;t take care that it be only in proportion to the value and impor|tance of the thing, about which zeal is exerci|&s;ed. It mu&s;t not with the &s;ame heat be exer|ci&s;ed about <HI>Modes</HI> and di&s;putable <HI>Rites,</HI> as about the <HI>E&s;&s;entials</HI> of our <HI>Chri&s;tian Faith,</HI> and <HI>Practice.</HI> The &s;ame degree of zeal is not due to Tithing Anni&s;e, Mint and Cummin, as to Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, Mercy and Peace, which are the weigh|tier matters of the Law; and the very vitals of
<PB N="48" REF="001329_0063_0FB27E1D211FC838">
and undefiled Religion. Herein therefore Wi&s;|dom teaches them to make a difference in the expre&s;&s;ions of their zeal; and not to pur&s;ue e|very thing with equal heat, earne&s;tne&s;s and pa&s;|&s;ion. And this zeal, thus attemper'd and pro|portioned to the weight of objects, and accord|ing to the&s;e rules directed by Prudence, will help Chri&s;t's Amba&s;&s;adors to carry on the <HI>Trea|ty of Peace</HI> with Sinners to advantage.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Prudence</HI> is to direct them in the right ma|nagement of their <HI>addre&s;&s;es</HI> to men. And there is a great degree of Prudence nece&s;&s;ary to the right ordering of the Publick Di&s;cour&s;es of Chri&s;t's Me&s;&s;engers: That they may know <HI>what to &s;ay,</HI> and <HI>what not</HI>; to determine in what <HI>Order, Method</HI> and <HI>Manner</HI> to treat of Divine Truths, that they may have the be&s;t influence upon their <HI>Audience.</HI> The Under&s;tanding is the <HI>Leading Faculty</HI> in the Soul, under the in|fluence of its Light and Conduct the Will, Af|fections, and all the executive powers are to be exerci&s;ed. Hence Religion mu&s;t fir&s;t in order of nature have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this power; and con&s;equently this Faculty mu&s;t be fir&s;t informed, and Wi&s;dom will direct the Servants of God, like wi&s;e <HI>Ma&s;ter Builders</HI> to lay here the Foundation of true Divine Knowledge.</P>
<P>It will al&s;o in&s;truct what things are to be taught in the <HI>Fir&s;t Place,</HI> and what <HI>Principally</HI> to be in&s;i&s;ted on, with greate&s;t frequency and inculcation. It mu&s;t direct in the <HI>Choice of

Subjects &s;uitable to the &s;tate and nece&s;&s;ities of a Peo|ple.</HI></P>
<P>Wi&s;dom mu&s;t teach al&s;o in what <HI>Manner</HI> the <HI>Truths</HI> and <HI>Laws of Heaven</HI> are to be promulga|ted. That they be di&s;pen&s;ed with <HI>Gravity,</HI> without <HI>Affectation;</HI> with <HI>Zeal</HI> and <HI>Courage</HI> without <HI>Temerity;</HI> with <HI>Authority</HI> without <HI>U&s;ur|pation;</HI> with <HI>Tenderne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Affection</HI> without the <HI>Weakne&s;s</HI> of humane Pa&s;&s;ion. It mu&s;t direct in the <HI>Dre&s;s</HI> and <HI>Language</HI> of their Di&s;cour&s;es. This mu&s;t be <HI>Intelligible, Pertinent,</HI> neither <HI>too La|boured</HI> nor too <HI>Negligent,</HI> mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive of the notions to be communicated, and free from that <HI>Pomp of Words</HI> that will ob&s;cure the Matter di&s;cour&s;ed of: this latter mu&s;t be avoided, left there be rea&s;on to &s;ay of a Di&s;cour&s;e, as the Philo&s;opher did of a Tragedy: <HI>It was a good One, if a man could have &s;een it for words.</HI> And as to the <HI>Language of Di&s;cour&s;es,</HI> a difference mu&s;t be allow'd, and is proper on &s;everal accounts: One Subject will allow greater Ornament of Language without any o&s;tentation, than ano|ther; an Addre&s;s to the Affections will admit that Language which may not be &s;o proper when the Under&s;tanding for its information is immediately apply'd to; there is a difference here al&s;o to be allowed between one Auditory and another; between common Di&s;cour&s;es, and &s;uch as are made on &s;ome &s;pecial Occa&s;i|on; and there is a difference between the Na|tural and Acquired Gifts of Preachers, &s;ome

being able to &s;peak with greater <HI>Strength,</HI> others with more of <HI>Ornament</HI> and <HI>Politene&s;s.</HI> Now Wi&s;dom is to con&s;ider the&s;e different circum|&s;tances, to &s;uit the Language to the <HI>Subject, Occa&s;ion,</HI> and <HI>End.</HI></P>
<P>Again, This mu&s;t direct to the be&s;t <HI>method</HI> of di&s;cour&s;ing: This can't be always the &s;ame, a variety of Subjects to be treated on, will not allow it. But Prudence will teach that Di&s;cour|&s;es be made always in the mo&s;t ea&s;y, natural, and intelligible method, that the matter will allow. This will be not only helpful to the <HI>Memory</HI> in <HI>retaining,</HI> but to the <HI>Under&s;tanding</HI> in taking a ju&s;t view of things.</P>
<P>In all the&s;e things the <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> of the Heralds of the Everla&s;ting Go&s;pel is to be di&s;played, to promote the good Entertainment of their Me&s;|&s;age.</P>

<P N="2">2. The <HI>Reward</HI> of Wi&s;e and Faithful Mini|&s;ters &s;hall be <HI>Di&s;tingui&s;hingly Great.</HI> I am not ig|norant that the Doctrine of <HI>Degrees of Glory</HI> has been holy di&s;puted in the <HI>Schools.</HI> The <HI>Affirmative</HI> &s;eems &s;o agreeable to the Principles of Right Rea&s;on, and &s;o clearly revealed in the infallible Oracles of Truth; that to me it appears more than <HI>Problematical.</HI> The <HI>Schoolmen</HI> indeed and <HI>Doctors</HI> in the <HI>Church of Rome</HI> build this upon a rotten Foundation, <HI>viz.</HI> The different degrees of Merit in Good Works.

The Parable of the Talents appears to a&s;&s;ert &amp; ju&s;ti|fy different degrees of Glory: <HI>Luke</HI> 19.16, 17, 18, 19. Where we find every Servant received from his Lord in proportion to his Improvement of what had been committed to him. And the Truth flows not from a bare <HI>Circum&s;tance</HI> of the Parable; but from the <HI>Main Scope</HI> of it, which was to Excite Chri&s;tians to an Improvement of their Talents in proportion to what they had re|ceived; and the Argument to engage to it is that their <HI>Reward</HI> &s;hall be <HI>Proportionable.</HI> He that
<PB N="54" REF="001329_0069_0FB27E30B58A9AA0">
gains ten Pounds &s;hall be Ruler over ten Cities; and he that gains five &s;hall Rule over five Cities.

And this point &s;eems &s;till to be &s;et in a fuller Light, in the 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.41, 42. There is one <HI>Glory</HI> of the <HI>Sun,</HI> another of the <HI>Moon</HI>; a|nother <HI>Glory</HI> of the <HI>Stars</HI>; for one <HI>Star</HI> differeth from another Star in <HI>Glory: So</HI> al&s;o is the <HI>Re&s;ur|rection</HI> of the <HI>Dead.</HI> Many other places might have been brought to have given in their Te&s;ti|mony to confirm the Doctrine a&s;&s;erted; but it &s;eems needle&s;s, Scripture appears for it, and has nothing, that I know of, again&s;t it: Nor do any of the pretended Arguments again&s;t it &s;eem to be of any force. This will not infer a real <HI>Im|perfection</HI> in the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of &s;uch Saints as En|joy a <HI>Le&s;s Degree</HI> of Glory. A <HI>Star</HI> is as perfect in its order as the <HI>Sun,</HI> yet they &s;hine with a dif|ferent Lu&s;tre. And I do not at pre&s;ent &s;ee any Ab&s;urdity in allowing a different Strength and Capacity in the ble&s;&s;ed. Every Soul &s;hall be full of Glory, but One may be capable to con|tain more than another. Saints are not Imper|fect when they fir&s;t Enter upon their Inheri|tance; yet a growth and improvement &s;eems

rea&s;onable to be allow'd them. Knowledge is an E&s;&s;ential part of their happine&s;s; and in this undoubtedly they will be always making Ad|vances.

But the Truth appears to me to lye thus. The Meritorious Obedience and Sufferings of Chri&s;t were a <HI>Refu&s;able Price</HI> in them&s;elves, which God was at Liberty to accept or refu&s;e, antecedently to his own Promi&s;e: And &s;o was at liberty to accept it for <HI>Whom,</HI> and to <HI>what Degree</HI> He &s;aw meet. By free Compact between the Father and Son it was agreed to be accepted for the full Pardon, Ju&s;tification and Happine&s;s of all God's Cho&s;en and Sanctifyed, and for the pur|cha&s;e of a greater degree of Glory for &s;ome, that &s;hould di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves in higher degrees of

<P><HI>Now,</HI> if there be &s;uch a gradual difference in the Glory that &s;hall be revealed in the Saints; Doubtle&s;s, tho&s;e that have been <HI>Wi&s;e</HI> and <HI>Faith|ful Stewards</HI> in Gods Hou&s;e here, will obtain a proportionable Exaltation in the Kingdom of Glory. Their Lord will di&s;tingui&s;h them by Particular Marks of Honour there, as they have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves here in Zeal and Fidelity in his Service. The Service they are now called to is Honourable, Great, and Diffi|cult; the Di&s;couragements they meet with, the Temptations they conflict with, the Self-denyal they mu&s;t Exerci&s;e, are all <HI>Peculiarly</HI> great; if therefore under all they maintain their Po&s;t, are Wi&s;e and Faithful, their Reward will be as <HI>Pecu|liar.</HI> They are now placed in a Station of Ho|nour and Dignity, if they are Faithful to their Tru&s;t, Chri&s;t will not <HI>Degrade</HI> them in the other World.

How jealous was he in his whole Con|ver&s;ation of the Honour of Sovereign Grace? How fearful le&s;t any thing &s;hould betray it, or cloud its Glory? How thoughtful al&s;o lea&s;t Grace &s;hould be abu&s;ed unto Wantonne&s;s?

No pretence could make him tran&s;|gre&s;s his own Line; and from the duties of his own Po&s;t nothing could move him.

The <HI>Body of Sin</HI> was his con&s;tant Burden, which he bewailed, groaned under, &amp; expre&s;&s;ed his long|ing de&s;ire to be freed from in &s;ome of his late&s;t hours. <HI>Meditation,</HI> which gives Life and Power to Grace, was his Exerci&s;e and Delight; and to what good purpo&s;e he performed this, may be &s;een in many SACRAMENTAL MEDI|TATIONS,

<P>The&s;e <HI>Gifts</HI> and <HI>Graces</HI> in Conjunction made him in a great degree Equal to the <HI>Station</HI> his Lord had fixed him in. And this was the Stage on which they appeared with beauty, and acted their Part with Glory. All that has been &s;aid, in de&s;cribing the <HI>Evangelical Pa&s;tor</HI> under the Doctrine, belong to his Character: who&s;e Pic|ture therein I was de&s;ignedly drawing. And his <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>Fidelity</HI> in their mo&s;t comprehen&s;ive &s;en&s;e, in Feeding and Ruling the Hou&s;e of God, are ju&s;tly Celebrated thro' the&s;e Churches.</P>
<P>At <HI>fir&s;t</HI> in his younger Years, his Ma&s;ter com|mitted to his Pa&s;toral Care a Flock in a more ob&s;cure part of this Wilderne&s;s: But &s;o great a Light was &s;oon ob&s;erved thro' the whole Land: And his Lord did not de&s;ign to bury him in ob|&s;curity, but to place him in a more Eminent Station, which he was qualifyed for. The Providence that occa&s;ioned his Removal to this Place was an <HI>Awful Judgment</HI> upon the whole Land; yet was Eventually a <HI>Mercy</HI> in this re|&s;pect, that it made way for the Tran&s;lation of this Bright Star to a more Con&s;picuous Orb; where his Influence was more Exten&s;ive and Beneficial; and in this it was a great <HI>Ble&s;&s;ing</HI> to this <HI>Congregation,</HI> to this <HI>Town,</HI> nay, to all <HI>New-England.</HI></P>

In his whole Mini&s;try he expre&s;|&s;ed a true love and zeal for Chri&s;t, and tender compa&s;&s;ion to Immortal Souls: There was light, heat and life in all his Addre&s;&s;es to them, which argued he well under&s;tood the worth of Souls, and had a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of their mi&s;erable Apo&s;tate Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>His <HI>Di&s;cour&s;es</HI> were all Elaborate, Acute and Judicious; Smelt of the Lamp, &amp; had nothing <HI>Mean</HI> in them.

the Stubborn Will, to humble the proude&s;t Sin|ner, and charm the deafe&s;t Adder. The <HI>Man|ner</HI> in which he deliver'd his Di&s;cour&s;es was a|greeable to the Matter.

<P>He applyed him&s;elf to <HI>Wounded Con&s;ciences</HI> with great Skill, Faithfulne&s;s and Tenderne&s;s. He &s;earcht their Wounds to the bottom, and made Application of <HI>Terror</HI> or <HI>Comfort,</HI> as their State called for, and as became a Wi&s;e, Tender and Faithful Phy&s;ician: And he knew how to be a <HI>Son of Thunder</HI> to the Secure and Hardened; and a <HI>Son of Con&s;olation</HI> to the Contrite and Bro|ken in Spirit.</P>
<P>His <HI>Publick Prayers</HI> were always Pertinent and Pathetical, animated with the Spirit of Devo|tion; and in them an <HI>Uncommon Compa&s;s of Thought was ob&s;ervable.</HI> In the Whole of his Work he was Laborious, careful to redeem time, and was in&s;tant in &s;ea&s;on and out of &s;ea&s;on in his Ma&s;ters Service.</P>
<P>His Affection &amp; Tenderne&s;s to THIS HIS DEAR FLOCK was &s;ingular. He might have &s;aid with the Apo&s;tle, that he could have impart|ed with the GOSPEL his own SOUL to them.</P>

<P>He went before this Flock as a Good She|pherd, Gathering the <HI>Lambs</HI> with his <HI>Arm,</HI> car|rying them in his <HI>Bo&s;ome,</HI> and <HI>Gently</HI> driving tho&s;e that are <HI>With Young</HI>: And is now gone to the GREAT <HI>Shepherd</HI> of the SHEEP; who&s;e Flock he here Watch't over, Lead, Fed and Defended.</P>

<P><HI>His Removal</HI> is a Great Judgment upon the whole Land. He was a Great Ble&s;&s;ing to it by his Faithful Warnings, Coun&s;els, Prayers and Tears, Life and Doctrine.

He was a Great part of the Chariots and Hor&s;e-men of our I&s;rael; A Faithful Watchman, <HI>Quick</HI> to e&s;py danger, and <HI>Faithful</HI> to Sound an Alarm: And has often Warned this People of Evils Ap|proaching, and again&s;t their Sins the procuring Cau&s;e of them.

<P>And it ought never to be forgotten, with what Prudence, Courage and Zeal he appeared for the good of this People, <HI>In that Dark and My&s;terious Sea&s;on,</HI> when we were a&s;&s;aulted from the Invi&s;ible World.

<P>It is a <HI>Critical Sea&s;on</HI> he is removed in; as dark a Day as ever pa&s;&s;ed over this Land; and it is well, if it be not a <HI>Prae&s;age</HI> of greater dark|ne&s;s; I am Sure the Setting of &s;o Bright a Star will make it &s;o.</P>

<P>The Lo&s;s of Such is Great; and we &s;hall be &s;tupid if we do not lay it to heart. The very thought of parting with them, whom we loved as our own Souls, is full of Darkne&s;s: And their actual Removal cannot but fill a &s;en&s;ible Soul with bitterne&s;s and wormwood.</P>

<P>Let this therefore a&s;&s;wage our griefs for the Death of that <HI>Prophet,</HI> over who&s;e Tomb we have been now dropping our Tears.</P>
<P>He is Enter'd into his Ma&s;ters Joy, and is po&s;&s;e&s;t of that immarce&s;&s;able Crown of Glory, which with patience and agony of Soul he has been contending for. He is now free from the

His Righteous Soul will be no more grieved with the impure Con|ver&s;ation of the Wicked; nor wounded with his own Infirmities. His Knowledge of God and Chri&s;t, his Love, Holine&s;s and Joy are now in their Perfection.

<P>And will not this relieve our mournful thoughts? Is it no Con&s;olation, for us to re|flect on that State of Un&s;tained Purity, Perfe|ction, and full Satisfaction he is advanced to?
