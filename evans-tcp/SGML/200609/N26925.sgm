<P>I know not any individual, to whom a model of conjugal excellence, of refined under&s;tanding, and at|tractive accompli&s;hments, can with more propriety be devoted, than to the confided friend, the cultivated companion, the amiable partner, of a character, in which <HI>America</HI> glories, and whom the world venerates.</P>
<P>Yet the writer of the&s;e pages &s;upplicates no patron|age, and &s;olicits no &s;upport, except the flattery of your e&s;teem, the encouragement of your approbation; and is le&s;s influenced by the benefit &s;he may derive, than by the emulation &s;he feels, in expre&s;&s;ing the high re|&s;pect and admiration, with which &s;he has the honor to con&s;ider her&s;elf</P>

<P>IF in a former publication the Author of the&s;e pages has attempted to portray the &s;ublime Virtues of Nature&mdash;with more &s;olicitude, though with le&s;s encour|agement, &s;he ventures on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion to &s;up|port, by a brilliant example, that the higher grades of civilized Society are no le&s;s productive of the pre-eminent qualities of fidelity and magnanimity, than the un&s;poiled and uncultivated communities of the fore&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject, founded upon a pathetic occurrence of the American Revolution, is principally &s;elected from a little book, containing letters of General Burgoyne: deeply affected by the intere&s;ting recital, the Author has not de|&s;paired of in&s;piring the &s;ame &s;ympathy in others; and, under that impre&s;&s;ion, again pre&s;umes to appear before the public tribunal.</P>
<P>The leading features of the following &s;ketch are literally drawn agreeably to the few characteri&s;tic outlines, which could be obtained; and the ornaments of Poetry have added but little to the de&s;cription of a patient, per&s;evering, <HI>fortitude,</HI> which, in di&s;playing the individual, ennobles the whole &s;pecies.</P>
