<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>INgratitude towards Men, after &s;ignal Favours received, is among&s;t all civilized People, looked upon with a ju&s;t Dete&s;tation; in&s;omuch, that the Moral <HI>Gentiles,</HI> in Ages po&s;t, thought they could give no wor&s;e a Character of a Per&s;on, than to call him <HI>Ungrateful:</HI> How much more then are <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> (e&s;pecially in a Time of &s;uch Light, as now &s;hineth) engaged, to &s;hun this Sin of <HI>Ingratitude,</HI> towards their God, whom they &s;en&s;ibly know, to be <HI>The Fountain of all their Mercies?</HI> And &s;urely, next to the infinite Mercy, &s;hewed them for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, in cau&s;ing the <HI>Day &s;pring from on high to vi&s;it their Souls,</HI> remarkable outward Deliverances, ought in a more than commonly remarkable Manner, to be the Objects of Gratitude to their great <HI>Deliverer.</HI> I mu&s;t confe&s;s, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hank&s;giving (which is what we poor Mortals can return, for the manifold Favours we daily receive from Him) hath its Ri&s;e in the Heart; and as <HI>out of the Abundance of the Heart, the Mouth &s;peaketh;</HI> how can tho&s;e who are truly thankful in Heart, but <HI>render the Calves of their Lips,</HI> in telling to their Friends and Acquaintance, <HI>How great Things God hath done for them?</HI> Nay, they are &s;o affected with &s;uch eminent Appearances of the protecting Hand of Providence, for their Help, Pre&s;ervation and Deliverance, that they are not willing to confine it to them only, but publi&s;h it to the World, that the Fame of their GOD may be &s;pread from <HI>Sea to Sea,</HI> and from one End of the <HI>Earth to the other.</HI></P>
<P>The following Relation being large, I &s;hall endeavour to be &s;hort; only, &s;ome of the Things which &s;eem to me mo&s;t remarkable, I would more particularly recommend to the Reader's Ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>1. The Hearts of all Men are in the Hands of God,</HI> he can turn them as he plea&s;es. When the&s;e <HI>Men-Eaters</HI> Fury was at height, their Knives in one Hand, and the poor Shipwrack'd People's Heads in the other, their Knees upon the others Shoulders, and their Looks di&s;mal; on a &s;udden, the <HI>Savages</HI> were &s;truck dumb, and their Countenances changed, that they looked like another People; the <HI>Ca&s;&s;ekey</HI> (or King) becoming as a Safeguard to the Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, from the Injuries of his own Men: Nay, &s;uch Confidence put he in
<PB REF="006658_0004_10297646B6791568">
them, that he would tru&s;t them to remove the Money he had taken from them&s;elves, before he would tru&s;t his own People. When they were got from there, to another Place, where they expected more Safety, they found them&s;elves di&s;appointed, fre&s;h Dangers pre&s;enting them&s;elves, as di&s;mally as before; yet God prevented any further Mi&s;chief, than the &s;tripping them of tho&s;e poor Rags the others had left them, and &s;ome other Abu&s;es, which by that Time were grown familiar to them, and were looked upon, as <HI>light Afflictions</HI>: The <HI>Ca&s;&s;ekey's</HI> Wife being made an In&s;trument for their Delivery, &s;he, and &s;ome others, having &s;omething of Tenderne&s;s of Heart in them, tho' among&s;t &s;uch an <HI>inhuman Crew.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> Many were the particular Diliverances, upon occa&s;ion of Injuries offered: Once, an Arrow &s;hot at them narrowly e&s;caped them: Another Time, &s;ome going to &s;hoot Arrows at them, certain of their own Company caught hold of their Bows and Arms; nay, though &s;ome of them &s;hot, yet their Arrows mi&s;t. Not to mention the frequent Dangers they were in, upon every &s;light Su&s;picion of their being <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> of which, more anon. And well might the&s;e poor Sufferers be in conti|nual Fear of their Lives, &s;ince about a Twelve Month before, a Parcel of <HI>Dutch-Men,</HI> who had likewi&s;e &s;uffered Shipwrack, had been killed and devoured; and moreover, of the many Ve&s;&s;els, &s;uppo&s;ed to be lo&s;t on that Coa&s;t, the&s;e are the fir&s;t Company that are known to have e&s;caped: Neither is it &s;o wonderful that they are thus cruel to Strangers, &s;ince they are unnatural to their own aged People; they having no more Compa&s;&s;ion on them, than to make them Slaves to the Youn|ger. Yet are the&s;e <HI>Men-Eaters</HI> as cowardly as cruel; when the <HI>Spaniards</HI> came up, the Sight of a ru&s;ty Mu&s;ket pre&s;ented towards them, would make &s;everal of them fly.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3.</HI> The Dangers they were delivered from, aro&s;e not only from Men, but the <HI>Elements</HI> al&s;o, which God permitted to threaten and afflict them. One Time, rowing in their Boat, the Sea &s;welled, &s;o that it was dangerous continuing there all Night, and as dangerous, to endeavour for the Shore; yet Providence failed them not, but conducted them &s;afe thither, as though there had been a Lane made through the Breakers: Another Time, by Rea&s;on of a great Flood, they were forced to remove their Lodgings &s;everal Times, and for divers Days, were in a continual Apprehen&s;ion of being drowned, at length were pre&s;erved upon an <HI>Oy&s;ter Hill</HI>: Not to mention the frequent Dangers they were in, by rea&s;on of the extream Cold, too tedious to touch at here; wherein this however is remarkable, that God can both admini&s;ter Strength in the Mid&s;t of Weakne&s;s, and al&s;o take away Strength, and cau&s;e Weakne&s;s to &s;eize, whenever he plea&s;es: Here was an Old Man, a Woman with a Sucking Child, and another with Child, Per&s;ons &s;eemingly very unlikely to encounter &s;uch Hard&s;hips, all e&s;caped; and divers <HI>Negroes,</HI> u&s;ed to more Hardine&s;s, peri&s;hed.</P>
<P N="4"><PB REF="006658_0005_102976483B18B920"><HI>4.</HI> As to Lodging, I &s;hall &s;ay little, any di&s;creet Per&s;on may imagine, how hard it was to People, well brought up, to lie on a Floor, &s;warming with Abundance of many Sorts of creeping Things, occa&s;ioned by the throwing the Berry Stones on the Floor, and letting all the Na&s;tine&s;s they made, lie there, which bred the&s;e Vermin; and yet perhaps might be accounted good Lodging, in Compari&s;on of the cold Ground, whereon they often lay afterwards un&s;heltered, expo&s;ed to the bleak Bla&s;ts of the rigid <HI>North-We&s;t-Wind.</HI></P>
<P N="5"><HI>5.</HI> Their Food mo&s;t &s;canty, the be&s;t of it &s;uch, as (I am ready to think) the meane&s;t <HI>Negro</HI> here, would not touch with his Lips: Sometimes the Gills and Guts of Fi&s;h, pick'd off a Dunghill; &s;ometimes the Scraps the <HI>Indians</HI> f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ung away, and the Water they boiled their Fi&s;h in, though never &s;o undecently handled. At fir&s;t their Sorrows were &s;o great, and their Alarms &s;o many, they could not eat; afterwards their Dyet &s;o uncouth, they could not away with it; until at length Hunger had &s;o far prevailed over them, that they could eat with an Appetite, the <HI>Palmetto-Berries;</HI> the Ta&s;te whereof was once irk&s;ome, and ready to take away their Breath; nay, &s;o fond were they of them, that the getting of about a Bu&s;hel accidentally, was looked on a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a great Prize.</P>
<P N="6"><HI>6.</HI> Their being forced to ma&s;k them&s;elves, under the Name of <HI>Spaniards,</HI> though few of them could &s;peak any <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> was another Hard&s;hip; mo&s;tly becau&s;e the Natives often &s;u&s;pected them to be <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and thereby they were continually in Danger of their Lives: Whether their Cruelty again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> proceeds from their being under no Apprehen&s;ion of Danger from them, and &s;o may think them&s;elves lawle&s;s, in what they do again&s;t our Nation; or whether it proceeds from any particular Di&s;gu&s;t offered them by &s;ome <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> I &s;hall not determine: However, it would do well, for tho&s;e that are not under their Power to avoid giving them any ju&s;t Cau&s;e of Offence, lea&s;t their Neighbours &s;uffer for their Faults: One of the&s;e <HI>Savages</HI> could complain, <HI>That, &s;ome Years pa&s;t, he had been taken off by &s;ome of our</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Sloops, from whom he e&s;caped by Swimming,</HI> and was therewith di&s;gu&s;ted, in&s;omuch, that could he, by his &s;ifting, have found out, that they were <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> it might have proved of ill Con&s;equence to them.</P>
<P N="7"><HI>7.</HI> The Courte&s;y of the Governor of <HI>Augu&s;tine,</HI> who clothed the&s;e naked People, fed their hungry Stomacks, and cau&s;ed them to be conducted &s;afely to <HI>Carolina,</HI> is not to be pa&s;&s;ed by, without due Notice; e&s;pecially being a Man of another Nation, as well as of a different Religion; and what is more, of &s;uch an one, as doth not teach its <HI>Votaries</HI> &s;o much Compa&s;&s;ion, towards tho&s;e they count <HI>Hereticks:</HI> Neither let me forget the Governor of <HI>Carolina,</HI> who&s;e Genero&s;ity compleated, what the Governor of <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> had begun, in a&s;&s;i&s;ting and cheri&s;hing the&s;e our afflicted Friends and Country Folks; with which, I &s;hall conclude the&s;e <HI>Remarks,</HI> to trea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> more particularly,
<PB REF="006658_0006_10293C6CAC5B1A40">
concerning that faithful Servant of the Lord, <HI>Robert Barrow,</HI> who was one of this Company.</P>
<P>This Man of God, who&s;e Habitation was in one of the Northern Counties of <HI>England,</HI> was early convinced of the ble&s;&s;ed Truth of God, profe&s;&s;ed by the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> and &s;oon after had a <HI>Di&s;pen&s;ation of the Go&s;pel</HI> committed to him. He lived, in his native Country, in e&s;teem among&s;t his Neighbours, for his Godly Conver&s;ation; and ho|noured in the Church of God, as an Elder, who had abode faithful in his Te&s;timony, both in Preaching the Go&s;pel, Suffering for the &s;ame, and Behaving him&s;elf an&s;werable thereunto. And in the Year <HI>1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">94.</HI> the Spirit of God (from whom he fir&s;t had his Commi&s;&s;ion) requiring him to come over into the&s;e Parts, to Preach the Go&s;pel here al&s;o; <HI>he was not di&s;obient to the Heavenly Call,</HI> but gave up to do the Will of God, though in a Cro&s;s to his own, as appeared by an Expre&s;&s;ion of his, before he left <HI>England,;</HI> which was to this Effect: <HI>That he had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">her immediately have laid down his natural Life there, if by &s;o doing he could have kept his Peace with God, than to have cro&s;&s;ed the Seas to</HI> America. Well, hither he came; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> he had thoroughly vi&s;ited the&s;e Parts, he took Ship for the <HI>We&s;t-India I&s;lands</HI>&punc; and at length was returning from <HI>Jamaica,</HI> to this Town of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> when the&s;e Calamities, mentioned in the en&s;uing <HI>Journal,</HI> befel him: How he behaved him&s;elf under them, with what Faith he overcome, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> wor&s;t of Men; &s;o that it may be &s;aid, He was <HI>more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">onqueror</HI> over tho&s;e Blood-Thir&s;ty <HI>Canibals;</HI> looking to Him <HI>who was Invi&s;ible,</HI> and by his Grace &s;eeing beyond them and their Cruelty; by Prayer <HI>wre&s;tling with God for a Ble&s;&s;ing;</HI> even the Ble&s;&s;ing of being delivered out of their barbarous Hands, and laying his Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ithful Friends; and &s;o effectual were his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Prayers, that they <HI>prevailed with God</HI>; and &s;o gracious was his God unto him, that he &s;ealed an A&s;&s;urance upon his Spirit, That his Prayers were heard, and &s;hould in due Time be an&s;wered, before he was yet off his Knees. And doubtle&s;s, he was made a Strength and a Comfort to his Companions in Affliction; who&s;e Remembrance will not be ea&s;ily blotted out of their Minds.</P>
<P>One remarkable Pa&s;&s;age I cannot well omit, which demon&s;trates he had well learn'd of Him who is a <HI>God of Truth,</HI> to &s;peak the Truth upon all Occa&s;ions, though with the Hazard of his Life. For, as the Reader may ob&s;erve in the Series of this following Relation, the&s;e poor People, for the Safe-guard of their Lives, had a&s;&s;umed the Name of <HI>Spaniards</HI>; &s;ome on that Account, a&s;&s;erting what was wrong, others concealing the Truth; yet this Hone&s;t-hearted Man, being directly a&s;ked the Que&s;tion, <HI>Nickalier, Nickalier?</HI> (their Word for <HI>Engli&s;h-Men</HI>) could do neither; but in Simplicity an&s;wered, <HI>Yes;</HI> being a&s;ked &s;o concerning another, he again an&s;wered, <HI>Yes.</HI> Yet though for his Plain-dealing, he was &s;tripp'd of his Clothes; which, till then, he
<PB REF="006658_0007_10297649C593DB40">
had &s;aved, God &s;uffered not the&s;e <HI>Savages</HI> to touch his Life, or the Lives of any of his Company.</P>
<P>Thus he pa&s;&s;ed through this afflicting Trial, and at length arrived at this Place, on the <HI>1</HI>&s;t Day of the <HI>2</HI>d Month, <HI>1697.</HI> though in much Weakne&s;s; having been taken very ill of the Belly|ach and Flux at <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI>; of which he never recovered, but &s;till grew wor&s;e, to his dying Day. It was about the <HI>8</HI>th Hour in the Evening, when the <HI>Ve&s;&s;el,</HI> he was Pa&s;&s;enger in, arrived at this Place. Divers Friends went on board, in order to get him a Shore, but he being in a very weak Condition, they could not remove him at that Time. He declared, <HI>His great Satisfaction, that the Lord had granted his Reque&s;t, that he might lay down his Bones in this Place; that his Heart was &s;trong, and he hoped he might fir&s;t &s;ee</HI> Friends <HI>again at the Meeting. He made mention of the Goodne&s;s of God to him, and that his Pre&s;ence had attended him in all his Exerci&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>The next Morning, being the <HI>2</HI>d of the <HI>2</HI>d Month, divers Friends went on board, to help the Ve&s;&s;el up to a Wharf, in order to get him on Shore; in which Time he &s;pake as before related, <HI>God's Power attending him.</HI> About the <HI>7</HI>th Hour, divers Friends carried him in a <HI>Hammocker</HI> (being wrapp'd up in a Blanket, and Clothes to keep him warm) to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Samuel Carpenter,</HI> where he declared, <HI>The Goodne&s;s of God to him; and that his Heart was yet &s;trong, and his Memory and Under&s;tanding good. After which he was &s;hifted, and then &s;lept a con&s;iderable Time.</HI></P>
<P>On the &s;ame Day, &s;ome Friends coming into the Room to vi&s;it him, at the Sight of them he &s;eemed to rejoice; and, putting forth his Hand, was ready to embrace them in much Love, and in a very tender Frame of Spirit. The Friends expre&s;&s;ed their Gladne&s;s to &s;ee him; but &s;aid, <HI>They were &s;orry to &s;ee him &s;o very weak:</HI> To which he replied, <HI>Although my Body be weak, my Mind is &s;ound, and Memory good.</HI> And further &s;aid, <HI>The Lord hath been very good to me, all along unto this very Day; and this Morning hath &s;weetly refre&s;hed me.</HI> And further added, <HI>The Lord hath an&s;wered my De&s;ire, for I de&s;ired Content, and that I might come to this Place, to lay my Bones among&s;t you.</HI> And afterwards &s;aid, <HI>It is a good Thing to have a Con&s;cience void of Offence, both towards God, and towards Men.</HI></P>
<P>On the <HI>4</HI>th Day of the <HI>2</HI>d Month, being the <HI>1</HI>&s;t Day of the Week, about the <HI>5</HI>th Hour in the Morning, he de&s;ired a Friend to write for him to his dear Wife, <HI>To remember his dear Love to her: and to let her know of his Travels, and being here; and that the Lord was with him; that his outward Affairs were &s;ettled; and That &s;he had wherewithall to live on.</HI> He further &s;aid, divers Friends being pre&s;ent; <HI>That the Lord was with him, and all Things were well; and that he had nothing to do, but to die:</HI> And accordingly on this Day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e dep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rted; and on the <HI>3</HI>d Day following,
<PB REF="006658_0008_1029764B61A0D360">
being the <HI>6</HI>th Day of the <HI>2</HI>d Month, was buried in Friends Burying-ground, in this Town of <HI>Philadelphia.</HI></P>
<P>And now, having brought my Relation, concerning this good Man, to the la&s;t Period of his Life, I might very well have put a Period to my <HI>Preface:</HI> But that I fore&s;ee, Some Per&s;ons may be ready to &s;ay. <HI>Here is an Account of very &s;trange Pa&s;&s;ages, but of what Credit is the Relator? May we depend upon his Authority, without Danger of being Impo&s;ed upon?</HI> To &s;uch I an&s;wer, He is a Man well known in this Town, of good Credit and Repute; on who&s;e Fidelity and Veracity, tho&s;e who have any Knowledge of him, will readily rely without &s;u&s;pecting Fallacy. But <HI>that in the Mouth of two or three Witne&s;&s;es every Thing may be e&s;tabli&s;hed,</HI> be&s;ides him and his Wife, a Per&s;on, who&s;e Re&s;idence (when at home) is in this Town, viz. <HI>Jo&s;eph Kirle,</HI> the Ma&s;ter of the <HI>Barkentine,</HI> in which they &s;uffered Shipwrack, a Man of an hone&s;t Character among&s;t his Neighbours, had the Peru&s;al of it, before it went to the Pre&s;s; and approved it. With which I &s;hall conclude, wi&s;hing my <HI>Reader</HI> much Satisfaction in the Reading of it; but never the Unhappine&s;s of Ex|periencing, in proper Per&s;on, the Truth of it.</P>

<P>The 14th Day, about Noon, were a Brea&s;t with <HI>Cape Antonia</HI>; and about a League to the Ea&s;tward off the <HI>Cape</HI> was a Fire with a great Smoak: At length People appeared on the <HI>Bay,</HI> making Signs for us to put on Shore; but having a fre&s;h Gale, and not know|ing who they were, our Ma&s;ter would not.</P>
<P>The 16th Day made the Table-land of the <HI>Havanna,</HI> and this Evening &s;tood over for <HI>Cape Florida</HI>; but about Eight or Nine at Night we &s;aw two Lights, being about a Mile from us; we fearing we were got among&s;t the French-Fleet, tacked, and &s;tood for the <HI>Havanna.</HI></P>
<P>The 18th Day, This Morning no Sail appeared, and being mo&s;t of the Day calm; we lay about Four Leagues off the <HI>Havanna</HI>; we had a fair Wind, and were de&s;igned for that Port, to enquire of the French-Fleet. This Afternoon came a Turnado from the Land, and our Ma&s;ter being on the Quarter-Deck, our Boom gibing knocked him down, and broke his Leg, which Accident was grievious to him and us; but having Things &s;uitable, with a little Experience, &s;et it.

<P>The 23d Day, About One a Clock in the Morning we felt our Ve&s;&s;el &s;trike &s;ome few &s;trokes, and then &s;he Floated again, for five or &s;ix Minutes, before &s;he ran fa&s;t a Ground, where &s;he beat violently at fir&s;t; the Wind was violent; and it was very dark, that our Marriners could &s;ee no Land: The Seas broke over us, that we were in a quarter of an Hour Floating in the Cabin: We endeavoured to get a Candle lighted, which in a little Time was accompli&s;hed. By this Time we felt the Ve&s;&s;el not to &s;trike &s;o often; but &s;everal of her Timbers were broken, and &s;ome Plank &s;tarted; the Seas continued breaking over us, and no Land to be &s;een.

<P>Within two or three Hours after the Departure of the two <HI>Indians,</HI> &s;ome of our People being near the Beach or Stand, returned and &s;aid, the <HI>Indians</HI> were coming in a very great Number, all running and &s;houting: About this Time the Storm was much aba|ted, the Rain cea&s;ed, and the Sun appeared, which had been hid from us &s;everal Days.

<P>We gave them to under&s;tand, that we came that Way. and were for the Northward: All which took Place with them.

Some Time before Night we had a Shower of Rain, where|upon the <HI>Ca&s;&s;ekey</HI> made Signs for us to build &s;ome Shelter; upon which we got our Tent up, and &s;ome Leaves to lye upon.</P>
<P>About this Time our Ve&s;&s;el lay dry on Shore, and the <HI>Indians</HI> gathered them&s;elves together, Men and Woman, &s;ome Hundreds in Number.

Night coming on, the <HI>Ca&s;&s;ekey</HI> put tho&s;e Che&s;ts and Trunks, which he had re&s;erved for him&s;elf, into our Tent; which plea&s;ed us, and gave an Expectation of his Com|pany; for he was now become a Defender of us from the Rage of others. The <HI>Ca&s;&s;ekey</HI> went down to the Water-Side, among&s;t his People, and returned with three old Coats that were wet and torn; which he gave us; one whereof I had.

And about Mid-night, we heard a Company of <HI>Indians</HI> coming from the Ve&s;&s;el towards us, making terrible Shouts, and coming fiercely up to the Tent; the <HI>Ca&s;&s;ekey</HI> called to them, which cau&s;ed them to &s;tand: It &s;eemed they had killed a Hog, and brought him; &s;o the <HI>Ca&s;&s;ekey</HI> asked us, if we would eat the Hog? <HI>Solomon Cre&s;&s;on,</HI> by our de&s;ire

<P>One Pa&s;&s;age I have omitted: Two of our <HI>Marriners,</HI> named <HI>Thomas Fowns</HI> and <HI>Richard Limpany,</HI> went forth this Morning, from our Tent, down to the <HI>Bay</HI> where the <HI>Indians</HI> were, and viewing of them at &s;ome Di&s;tance, an <HI>Indian-Man</HI> came runing upon them, with his Knife in his Hand took hold of <HI>Thomas Fowns</HI> to &s;tab him; but the &s;aid <HI>Thomas</HI> fell on his Knees, u&s;ing a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Ceremony, and begged not to kill him, whereupon the <HI>Indian</HI> de&s;i&s;ted, and bid him be gone to the Place from whence he came.

In two Hours Time he got as many Fi&s;h as would &s;erve twenty Men: There were others al&s;o Fi&s;hing at the &s;ame Time, &s;o that Fi&s;h was plenty; but the &s;en&s;e of our Conditions, &s;tayed our hungry Stomachs, for &s;ome among&s;t us thought they would feed us, to feed them&s;elves.</P>

<P>The <HI>Ca&s;&s;ekey,</HI> and &s;ome other <HI>Indians,</HI> went with our People towards our Wreck, we rowing along Shore, and our Boat very leaky, that one Per&s;on had employ enough to heave out the Water.</P>

As for our poor young <HI>Child,</HI> they &s;natched from it what little it had, as though they would have &s;haken and torn it, Limb from Limb. After they had taken all from us but our Lives, they began to talk one to another, vehe|mently Foaming at the Mouth, like wild <HI>Boars,</HI> and taking their <HI>Bows</HI> and <HI>Arrows,</HI> with other <HI>Weapons,</HI> cryed out, <HI>Nickaleer, Nickaleer, Solomon</HI> &s;pake in <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> to them, and &s;aid, We were <HI>Spaniards</HI>: But they would not hear him, and continued crying out <HI>Nickaleer, Nickaleer</HI>; withal drawing their <HI>Arrows</HI> to the Head. But &s;uddenly we per|ceived them to look about and li&s;ten, and then de&s;i&s;ted to pro&s;ecute their bloody De&s;ign. One of them took a pair of Breeches, and gave it to my Wife.

<P><HI>Robert Barrow,</HI> with my &s;elf, Wife and Child, were ordered to go into a <HI>Cannoo,</HI> to be carried to the other Side of the <HI>Inlet,</HI> being a Furlong over; four <HI>Indians</HI> being in the <HI>Cannoo</HI> to paddle: When we came to the other Side, within a <HI>Cannoo's</HI> length of two of the Shore, a Number of <HI>Indians,</HI> with their <HI>Bows</HI> and <HI>Arrows,</HI> came running into the Water, &s;ome to their Knees, &s;ome deeper, having their <HI>Bows</HI> and <HI>Arrows</HI> drawn up, crying out, <HI>Nickaleer, Nickaleer</HI>; which they continued without cea&s;ing. The <HI>Indians</HI> that brought us over leap'd out of the <HI>Can|noo,</HI> and &s;wam a Shore, fearing they &s;hould be &s;hot. But in this Juncture it plea&s;ed God to tender the Hearts of &s;ome of them towards us, e&s;pecially the <HI>Ca&s;&s;ekey's</HI> Wife, and &s;ome of the chiefe&s;t among&s;t them, who were made In|&s;truments to intercede for us, and &s;top the Rage of the Multitude, who &s;eem'd not to be &s;atisfy'd without our Blood. The <HI>Ca&s;&s;eekey</HI> ordered &s;ome to &s;wim, and fetch the <HI>Cannoo</HI> a Shore; which being done, his Wife came in a Com|pa&s;&s;ionate Manner and took my Wife out of the <HI>Can|noo,</HI> ordering her to follow her, which we did &s;ome di&s;tance from the Inlet Side, and &s;tood till all our People were brought over, which in a little Time was done. But the Rage of &s;ome was &s;till great, thir&s;ting to &s;hed our Blood; and a mighty Strife there was among&s;t them; &s;ome would kill us, others would prevent it: And thus one <HI>In|dian</HI> was &s;triving with another. All being got over, were to walk along the Sea-Shore to their Town. In this Pa&s;&s;age we, mo&s;t of us, felt the Rage of &s;ome of them, either by &s;triking or &s;toning; and divers <HI>Arrows</HI> were &s;hot: But tho&s;e that were for Pre&s;erving us, would watch tho&s;e that were for de&s;troying us: And when &s;ome of them
<PB N="23" REF="006658_0031_10297695CF58F098">
would go to &s;hoot, others of them would catch hold of their Bows or Arms. It was &s;o ordered, that not one of us was touched with their Arrows; &s;everal of us were knock'd down, and &s;ome tumbled into the Sea; we dared not help one another, but help we had by &s;ome of them, being made in&s;trumental to help us. My Wife received &s;everal Blows; and an <HI>Indian</HI> came and took hold of her Hair, and was going either to cut her Throat, or &s;ome|thing like it, having his Knife nigh her Throat; but I looked at him, making a &s;ign that he &s;hould not; &s;o he de&s;i&s;ted. At which Time another <HI>Indian</HI> came, with a handful of Sea-Sand, and filled our poor Child's Mouth. By this Time the <HI>Ca&s;&s;ekey's</HI> Wife, came to my Wife, &s;eeing her op|pre&s;&s;ed, and they pulled the Sand out of our Child's Mouth, and kept by my Wife untill we got into the <HI>Ca&s;&s;akey's</HI> Hou&s;e, which was about Forty <HI>Foot</HI> long, and Twenty-five <HI>Foot</HI> wide, covered with <HI>Palmetto</HI> Leaves both Top and &s;ides. There was a Range of Cabbins, or a <HI>Barbecue,</HI> on one &s;ide and two Ends: At the entering on one Side of the Hou&s;e, a Pa&s;&s;age was made of Benches on each Side, lead|ing to the Cabbins. On the&s;e Benches &s;at the chief <HI>In|dians,</HI> and at the upper End of the Cabbin was the <HI>Ca&s;|&s;ekey</HI> &s;eated. A kind of Debate was held among&s;t them for an Hour's Time. After which <HI>Solomon,</HI> and &s;ome others were called to the <HI>Ca&s;&s;ekey,</HI> and were &s;eated on the Cab|bin; where the <HI>Ca&s;&s;ekey</HI> talked to <HI>Solomon</HI> in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Language, but could not hold a Di&s;cour&s;e. In a little Time &s;ome raw <HI>Deer-Skins</HI> were brought in, and given to my Wife, and Negro-Women; and to us Men &s;uch as the <HI>Indians</HI> wear, being a Piece of Platt-work of a kind of Silk-Gra&s;s wrought of divers Colours, and of a trian|gular Figure, with a Belt of four Fingers broad of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ame, wrought together, which goeth about the Wa&s;te&punc; and the Angle of the other having a thing to it, com|ing between the Legs; and Strings to the Ends of the Belt.

Covering that the Men wear; and thus they Clothed us&punc; A Place was appointed for us, Mats being laid on the Floor of the Hou&s;e, where we were ordered to lye down. But the Place was extreame na&s;ty; for all the Stones of the Berries which they eat, and all the Na&s;tne&s;s that's made among&s;t them, lay on their Floor, that the Place &s;warmed with abundance of many Sorts of creeping things; as, a large black hairy <HI>Spider,</HI> which hath two Claws like a Carb, <HI>Scorpions,</HI> and numberle&s;s Number of &s;mall <HI>Buggs.</HI> On the&s;e Mats we lay, the&s;e Vermin crawling over our naked Bodies.

The <HI>Indians</HI> were &s;eated, as afore&s;aid, the <HI>Ca&s;&s;ekey</HI> at the up|per End of them; and the Range of Cabbins was fill'd with Men, Women and Children, beholding us: At length we heard a Women or two cry, according to their Manner, and that very &s;orrowfully, one of which I took to be the <HI>Ca&s;&s;ekey's</HI> Wife, which occa&s;ioned &s;ome of us to think, that &s;omething extraordinary was to be done to us. We heard a &s;trange Sort of a Noi&s;e, which was not like the Noi&s;e made by a Man, but we could not under&s;tand what, nor where it was; for &s;ometimes it &s;ounded to be in one Part of the Hou&s;e, &s;ometimes in another, to which we had an Ear: And indeed our Ears and Eyes could perceive or hear nothing, but what was Strange and Di&s;mal, and Death &s;eem'd to &s;orround us; but Time di&s;covered this Noi&s;e unto us. The Occa&s;ion of it was thus: In one Part of this Hou&s;e where the Fire was kept, was an <HI>Indian</HI> Man, having a Pot on the Fire, wherein he was making a Drink, of the Leaves of a Shrub (which we under&s;tood afterwards by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> is called <HI>Ca&s;&s;eena</HI>) boyling the &s;aid Leaves, after they had parched them in a Pot; then with a Gourd, having a long Neck, and at the Top of it a &s;mall Hole, which the Top of one's Fin|ger could cover, and at the Side of it a round Hole of two Inches Diameter; they take the Liquor out of the Pot, and put it into a deep <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ound Bowl, which being al|mo&s;t filled, containeth nigh three Gallons: With this Gourd
<PB N="25" REF="006658_0033_1029769BDE6718A8">
they brew the Liquor, and make it froth very much; it looketh of a deep brown Colour. In the Brewing of this Liquor was this Noi&s;e made, which we thought &s;trange; for the pre&s;&s;ing of this Gourd gently down into the Liquor, and the Air which is contained, being forced out of the little hole at Top, occa&s;ioned a Sound, which according to the Time and motion given, would be various. This Drink, when made, and cool to Sup, was in a Conck-Shell, fir&s;t carried to the <HI>Ca&s;&s;ekey,</HI> who threw Part of it on the Ground, and the re&s;t he drank up, and then would make a loud H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m; and afterwards the Cup pa&s;&s;ed to the re&s;t of the <HI>Ca&s;&s;ekey's</HI> A&s;&s;ociaties, as afore&s;aid; but no other Man, Woman nor Child, mu&s;t touch or ta&s;te of this Sort of Drink; of which he &s;at Sipping, Chat|tering and &s;moaking Tobacco, or &s;ome other Herb in|&s;tead thereof, for the mo&s;t Part of the Day.</P>
<P>About Noon was &s;ome Fi&s;h brought us on &s;mall <HI>Pal|metto</HI> Leaves, being boiled with Scales, Heads and Gills, and nothing taken from them but the Guts, but our Trou|bles and Exerci&s;e were &s;uch, that we cared not for Food.</P>
<P>In the Evening, we being laid on the Place afore&s;aid, the <HI>Indians</HI> made a Drum of a Skin, covering therewith the deep Bowl, in which they brewed their Drink, beating thereon with a Stick, and having a couple of Rattles, made of &s;mall Gourds put on Sticks with &s;mall Stones in, &s;hak|ing them, they began to &s;et up a mo&s;t hideous howling, very irk&s;ome to us, and &s;ometime after came &s;ome of their Young Women, &s;ome Singing, &s;ome Dancing.

<P>About the tenth Hour, we ob&s;erved the <HI>Indians</HI> to be on a &s;udden Motion; mo&s;t of the Principal of them be|took them&s;elves to their Hou&s;es; the <HI>Ca&s;&s;ekey</HI> went to Dre&s;|&s;ing his Head, and Painting him&s;elf, and &s;o did all the re&s;t: When they had done, they came into the <HI>Ca&s;&s;ekey's</HI> Hou&s;e, and &s;eated them&s;elves in Order: In a &s;mall Time after came an <HI>Indian</HI> with &s;ome Attendance into the Hou&s;e, making a Ceremonious Motion, and &s;eated him&s;elf by the <HI>Ca&s;&s;ekey,</HI> the Per&s;ons that came with him &s;eated them&s;elves among&s;t the others: After &s;ome &s;mall pau&s;e, the <HI>Ca&s;&s;ekey</HI> began a Di&s;cour&s;e, which held nigh an Hour; After which the Strange <HI>Indian</HI> and his Companions went forth to the Water-Side, unto their <HI>Cannoo,</HI> lying in the Sound, and returned pre&s;ently with &s;uch Pre&s;ents as they had brought, delivering them unto the <HI>Ca&s;&s;ekey,</HI> and tho&s;e &s;itting by giving an Applau&s;e. The Pre&s;ents were &s;ome few Bunches of the Herb they make their Drink of, and another Herb which they u&s;e in&s;tead of <HI>Tobacco,</HI> and &s;ome platted Balls, &s;tuffed with Mo&s;s, to lay their Heads on, in&s;tead of Pillows: The Ceremony being ended, they all &s;eated them&s;elves again, and went to Drinking <HI>Ca&s;&s;eena,</HI> Smoaking and Talk|ing, during the Strangers &s;tay.</P>
<P>About Noon &s;ome Fi&s;h was brought us; Hunger was grown &s;tronger upon us, and the Quaintity given was not much more than each a Mouthful, which we Eat; The <HI>Ca&s;&s;ekey</HI> ordered the Ma&s;ter, <HI>Jo&s;eph Kirle, Solomon Cre&s;|&s;on,</HI> my Wife and me, to &s;it upon their Cabin to eat our Fi&s;h; and they gave us &s;ome of their Berries to Eat: We ta&s;ted them&punc; but not one among&s;t us could &s;uffer them to &s;tay in our Mouths, for we could compare the ta&s;te of them to nothing el&s;e, but rotten Chee&s;e &s;teep'd with <HI>Tobacco.</HI> Sometime after we had eaten, &s;ome of the <HI>Indian,</HI> asked us, If we were <HI>Spaniards?

<P>About the third Hour in the Afternoon, the Strangers went away, and &s;ome &s;mall Time after, they having &s;atis|fied them&s;elves that mo&s;t of us were <HI>Spaniards,</HI> told us that we &s;hould be &s;ent for to the next Town; and they told us that there was a <HI>Nickaleer</HI> off, and we under&s;tood them [<HI>Engli&s;h Men of</HI> Bri&s;tol] al&s;o the Number of &s;ix Men and a Woman; and that they were to be put to Death before we &s;hould get thither.

On the Morrow they de&s;igned to travel to the Northward: But <HI>Andrew Barnes,</HI> their Mate, having been along Time afflicted with a Flux, which had wa&s;ted his Body to Skin and Bone, &s;o that he was not able to help him&s;elf, they left him, and travelled a Mile or more, and came to the Inlet, which they could not pa&s;s: Whereupon they returned back again, to take their Boat; but at their Return, before they could get away with their Boat, they e&s;pyed the <HI>Indians</HI> coming on them, who &s;oon got to them; asked in <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> What Nation they were? If <HI>Spaniards, Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>French</HI>? But the <HI>Indians</HI> made Signs to give them their Clothing, which they readily did. But &s;till they enquired, Of what <HI>Nation</HI>?

<P>About this Time <HI>John Smith</HI> and <HI>Andrew Morray</HI> were &s;harply &s;eized with a Fever and Ague: When the Fit of the Ague was on them, the <HI>Indians</HI> would mock and deride them: This we well ob&s;erved, that the&s;e People had no Compa&s;&s;ion on their own Aged declining People, when they were pa&s;t their Labour, nor on others of their own, which lay in any declining Condition: For the Younger is &s;erved before the Elder, and the Elder People, both Men and Women, are Slaves to the Younger.</P>
<P>In this Place we &s;aw many Tokens of &s;ome of our Nation's having fallen into the Hands of the&s;e People: As, two Engli&s;h Cannoos, one of Cedar, the other of <HI>Cotton-Tree,</HI> like tho&s;e of <HI>Jamaica</HI>; &s;everal Blocks and Shelves of <HI>Lignum-Vitae</HI>; &s;everal Tools and Knives, and more particularly, a <HI>Razor,</HI> on the haft of which, was writ the Man's Name, thus, THOMAS FOSTER.

<P>This Morning, about Sun-ri&s;ing, came two Strange <HI>Indians,</HI> who had run &s;o hard, that they Sweated extream|ly, of whom we under&s;tood, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were coming with their Old <HI>Ca&s;&s;ekey</HI>: which News &s;urpri&s;ed us, doubting the Truth of it, for <HI>Solomon</HI> had been gone but &s;ixteen Days, and we under&s;tood that they mu&s;t have an extraordinary Pa&s;&s;age to be here in a Month: We had not long to con&s;ider of the Matter, for in an Hour's Time we heard four Muskets di&s;charged, and immediate|ly we looked out, and the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in their <HI>Perriauger</HI> were in &s;ight. The <HI>Indians</HI> were like a People amazed, and overcome with Fear: We perceived the Noi&s;e of a Gun was terrible unto them. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> Landed, being in number Twelve, one <HI>Seba&s;tian Lopez</HI> Com|manding Ten Soldiers, with one <HI>Indian</HI> an Interpeter. The <HI>Spaniards</HI> embraced us very chearfully, and expre&s;|&s;ed their being glad to find us alive: But we were not able to Di&s;cour&s;e each other, though we had &s;o much

<P>We received a Letter from <HI>Solomon,</HI> which he writ when he met with Capt. <HI>Seba&s;tian Lopez,</HI> &s;ignifying the Governnment of <HI>Augu&s;teen's</HI> great Care for our Pre|&s;ervation, of what Nation &s;oever we were: But how the&s;e Per&s;ons, or the Governor of <HI>Augu&s;teen,</HI> had knowledge of us, we could not under&s;tand; for they had been fourteen Days from <HI>Augu&s;teen,</HI> which was nigh the Time <HI>Solomon</HI> went hence; and they met <HI>Solomon</HI> about half way, and &s;ent him for <HI>Augu&s;teen</HI> with other Guides, bringing the Old <HI>Ca&s;&s;ekey</HI> and his People with them: We ob|&s;erved that the Old <HI>Ca&s;&s;ekey</HI> &s;eem'd much dejected.

<P>The <HI>Spaniards</HI> were extraordinary kind unto us, &s;o that we had Occa&s;ion to rejoice, and thank the Lord for this part of our Delivrance by their Means: They were al&s;o a Terror unto the <HI>Indians</HI>; for they &s;earched their Hou&s;es, and took all from them that ever they could find, even to the Stump of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ail; which aggravated them, and increa&s;ed their di&s;-affection to us-ward, &s;o that we dar'd not &s;tir from a <HI>Spaniard.</HI> The <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Captain made inquiry where we were ca&s;t away, and what was &s;aved that we had in our Ve&s;&s;el? We gave an Account, &s;o well as we could, to make him under&s;tand us; which Account made him very de&s;irous to go down thither; but looking over a Paper often, which we &s;uppo&s;ed, was the Governor's Order and In&s;tructions to him; we under&s;tood they would

not permit him to pro&s;ecute his De&s;igns; be&s;ides, we made him &s;en&s;ible of the Danger we &s;hould be in, if he and his Men &s;hould go and leave us among&s;t the&s;e People, who were bitterly incen&s;ed again&s;t us.</P>
<P>They inquired what became of the Boat that belong|ed to Smith's Ve&s;&s;el and ours, we told them, that the&s;e <HI>Indians</HI> had taken Smith's Boat and &s;unk her &s;omewhere in the Sound, but ours was at St. <HI>Lucia:</HI> The <HI>Spaniards</HI> made the <HI>Indians</HI> go and &s;hew where they had &s;unk Smith's Boat, and help our People to get her up; which being done, &s;he was brought to the Town: The <HI>Spaniards</HI> were mightily plea&s;ed with her, and propo&s;ed, that they in their Cannoo, and our People in that Boat, &s;hould go to <HI>Hoe-Bay,</HI> whereby they might get all from the <HI>Indians,</HI> which they had gotten from us, but we would not countenance the Matter: We were for us &s;peedy de|parting from among&s;t the&s;e People, as we could, &s;ince it plea&s;ed God to open a Way for our Deliverance.</P>
<P>This Morning the Spani&s;h Captain made the <HI>Indians</HI> provide two Cannoos, which he cau&s;ed to be la&s;hed to|gether, at &s;ome di&s;tance, with Sticks a cro&s;s, and mat|ted on the Top; which being done, with four <HI>Indians, Jo&s;eph Kirle, John Smith, Robert Barrow, Andrew Mor|ray, Benjamin Allen, Nathaniel Randall, John Shears, Cor|nelius Toker, Jo&s;eph Kirle's Boy John Hilliar, four Negors, viz. Jack, Cae&s;ar, Sarah and Quenza,</HI> were &s;ent away for <HI>Augu&s;teen</HI>; but not one Mor&s;el of Victuals, except a very few Berries, had they with them; and not one <HI>Spaniard</HI> to Guard them, but were put under the Government of tho&s;e four <HI>Indians.</HI> About an Hour after <HI>Jo&s;eph Kirle</HI> was gone, the Spani&s;h Captain ordered Smith's Boat to be get ready, with two <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and four of our Men, to row to the Place where the drift of Smith's Ve&s;&s;el was, to look for <HI>Log-wood</HI> or old Iron. When they re|turned, there was not any Thing of Value: But our People &s;aid, that as they were &s;earching about, they found the Bones of <HI>Andrew Barns</HI>; his Skull and Jaw-Bone were broken, which occa&s;ioned us &s;u&s;pect, that he was

knocked on the Head by the <HI>Indians,</HI> after they had driven away <HI>Smith</HI> and his People.</P>
<P>We told the Spani&s;h Captain, that <HI>Jo&s;eph Kirle's Negro,</HI> Ben, had been ab&s;ent, ever &s;ince the Day after <HI>Solomon Cre&s;&s;on</HI> went hence, being gone with the Old <HI>Ca&s;&s;ekey's</HI> Wife, but we knew not whither. The Captain made inquiry of the <HI>Indians</HI> whither he was gone; they &s;aid, for <HI>Hoe-Bay:</HI> Then be ordered them to &s;end for him, for he would not leave him behind: The <HI>Indians</HI> &s;aid, he would be here within a Day or two.</P>
<P>The Spaniards were continually &s;earching for what they could find, of &s;uch Things as the <HI>Indians</HI> had gotten from us or others: And when they could find no more, they would offer to buy with Tobacco what they could per&s;wade the <HI>Indians</HI> to bring to Light A Leaf, or half a Leaf of Tobacco, would purcha&s;e a Yard of Linen or Woollen, or Silk, from the <HI>Indians</HI>; &s;uch Admirers of Tobacco are they, that they e&s;teem it beyond any other Thing.</P>
<P>An <HI>Indian</HI> of the Town, &s;ometime before the Spaniards came, having a con&s;iderable Quantity of <HI>Ambergreece</HI> boa&s;t|ed, that when he went for <HI>Augu&s;teen</HI> with that, he could purcha&s;e of the Spaniards, a <HI>Looking-Gla&s;s,</HI> an <HI>Ax,</HI> a <HI>Knife</HI> or two, and three or four <HI>Mannocoes,</HI> (which is about five or &s;ix Pounds) of Tobacco: The Quantity of <HI>Am|ber-greece</HI> might be about five Pound weight.</P>

<P>The Spaniards had brought little Provi&s;ion with them, &s;o that there was not much to &s;pare for us, having not

<P>This Morning, about three Hours before Day, we departed from this Town of <HI>Jece</HI>; the weather was grown Cold, we had nothing wherewith to cover our Bodies, be&s;ides what the <HI>Indians</HI> gave us at fir&s;t, except my Wife, for whom the Spaniards got an old Jacket (which had been one of Smith's Men's) and gave her to wear; al&s;o a &s;mall piece of Cloth to cover our poor Child: But it plea&s;ed God to &s;trengthen us, in this our Condition, &s;o that we rowed all this Day without cea&s;ing, untill three Hours after it was dark, by which Time we got to an <HI>Indian-Town:</HI> Here we met with <HI>Jo&s;eph Kirle, Robert Bar|row</HI> and the others, who got thither not above an Hour or two bfore us.

<P>This Morning, leaving this Town, we Embarqued in our two Boats, and tho&s;e of our People that were at the other Town, were to have a large <HI>Cannoo</HI> to carry them thence, and were to meet us in the Sound: We rowed &s;everal Leagues, and did not meet them, it being then about ten a Clock; the <HI>Spaniard</HI> would go on Shore, and travel back by Land to &s;ee after them. We being by an Inlet of the Sea, which was a Mile over, the <HI>Spani|ard</HI> ordered us to go on the other &s;ide, and there &s;tay for him; which we did many Hours: At this Place we all went upon &s;earch, to &s;ee if any thing was to be had for the Belly, &s;ome on the Land, &s;ome in the Water: The Land yielded nothing, but in the Water we got a Sort of Shell-Fi&s;h, called <HI>Water-Soldiers,</HI> which we eat: At length the <HI>Cannoo</HI> with our People came, but our <HI>Spaniard</HI> was not come; but in about an half Hour's Time he came with a &s;mall <HI>Cannoo.</HI> This was the Place where <HI>Solomon</HI> met the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> The <HI>Cannoos</HI> had each two <HI>Indians</HI> to &s;et them along; and we had one <HI>Indian</HI> for our Guide, named <HI>Juan Antonio</HI>&punc; who the <HI>Spaniard</HI> &s;aid was a Chri&s;tian, but an Inhabitant of that Town, where the <HI>Dutch-Men</HI> were killed. We &s;et forward in our two Boats, and the two <HI>Cannoos,</HI> and rowed till Night, being nigh a Place of thicketty Wood, which we made choice of to lodge at for this Night: Here was Wood enough; we made large Fires, we were plea&s;ed with the Place, and lay down to re&s;t. About Mid-night I had a great Lo&s;s, having a Quart of Berries whole, and as much

<P>Poor <HI>Robert Barrow</HI> was a great way behind us, I feared we &s;hould never &s;ee him again. I u&s;ed my endeavour to comfort and cheer my Wife, intreating her not to let Grief overcome her: I had hopes that the Lord would help us in this &s;traight, as he had done in many &s;ince we were in this Land: And if it plea&s;ed God that we &s;hould lay down our Lives in this Wilderne&s;s, that we might be&s;eech him to enable us to do it willingly. Thus &s;triving in a deep Exerci&s;e of Body and Mind, we travelled on, admiring God's Goodne&s;s in pre&s;erving us thus far through &s;o many eminent Dangers; in the &s;en&s;e of which, a &s;ecret hope would ari&s;e, (tho' involved with human Doubts and Fears) That the Lord would yet pre&s;erve us.

Its Mother would take it now and then, and give it the Brea&s;t, but little could it get at it: Be&s;ides, we dared not &s;top in the lea&s;t; for if we did, we &s;hould perceive our Limbs to fail. About two a Clock in the Afternoon, we came up with our Negro-Woman <HI>Hagar,</HI> with her Child at her Back, almo&s;t dead: And a little further we came up with our Negro-Girl <HI>Quen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a,</HI> being dead, as we thought; for &s;he was as &s;tiff as a dead, Body could be, and her Eyes &s;et; but at length we per|ceived her Breath; but &s;he had no Sen&s;e nor Motion.

This increa&s;ed my Wife's Sorrow, and &s;he began to doubt, &s;he &s;hould not be able to travel much further; but I endeavor|ed to encourage her, not to leave her &s;triving, as long as any Ability was left.
