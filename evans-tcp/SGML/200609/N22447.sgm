<HEAD>EDITORS PREFACE TO THE AMERICAN EDITION, WITH PLATES.</HEAD>
<P>THE following Poem was fir&s;t publi&s;h|ed in 1782, in the &s;tate of Connecticut, where the Author was born, and received his education, and where he now re&s;ides. It has pa&s;&s;ed through &s;everal impre&s;&s;ions in this country, and Great-Britain, and has obtained univer&s;al celebrity.</P>
<P>In 1792 a &s;plendid edition of it appear|ed in London, with explanatory notes. So far as the&s;e notes contain facts, and &s;erve to elucidate pa&s;&s;ages, which would be otherwi&s;e ob&s;cure, they are <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="iv" REF="029659_0004_0FE212A7810CFB60">
in this edition: But as that London edi|tion was publi&s;hed to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es of a party, and the Editor has taken the liberty to mi&s;repre&s;ent the views of the Author, the preface and &s;uch of the notes as were in&s;erted for that purpo&s;e, are here omitted. This is done at the re|que&s;t of the author, with who&s;e permi&s;&s;i|on, this edition is offered to the Ameri|can public.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign of the Poem will be&s;t ap|pear from its general tenor. The Au|thor, at the time the oppo&s;ition of Ame|rica to the unju&s;t claims of the Briti&s;h Parliament, was maturing into &s;y&s;tem, liv|ed in Bo&s;ton with one of the principal projectors of American Independence. He e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of his country, and became intimately acquainted with the tran&s;actions of the early revolutioni&s;ts, and all the mea&s;ures of the Briti&s;h agents, to counter-act the oppo&s;ition. This appears by a number of Anecdotes, very humor|ou&s;ly related, in the cour&s;e of the Poem.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="029659_0005_0FE212A9E7BA93F8">That the Author is a warm friend of American Independence, is obvious, from the whole tenor of the work; and the principal &s;cope of the Poem &s;eems to have been, to ridicule the claims of the Bri|ti&s;h Parliament, and the mea&s;ures pur&s;ued to enforce tho&s;e claims. At the &s;ame time, the ab&s;urdities and mi&s;conduct of his own countrymen have not e&s;caped his no|tice.</P>
<P>The Author is no friend to monarchy, nor ari&s;tocracy; nor is he a raving de|mocrat. He is a friend of republican go|vernment, and rational liberty&mdash;that liber|ty which is &s;ecured by ju&s;t laws, and a &s;teady admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice. But it is not true that the Poem was written with the &s;ole view to ridicule any particular form of government.</P>
<P>The &s;cene of the Poem is laid in Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts, where the Revolution originated. The time is in 1775. M'FINGAL the hero, is de&s;igned to repre&s;ent the tory fac|tion
<PB N="vi" REF="029659_0006_0FE212AC5156FED0">
in general: and HONORIUS, the whigs.</P>
<P>It is unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay any thing of the merit of the Poem. This is univer&s;ally acknowledged; and the Poem will conti|nue to be read and admired, while true ta&s;te and &s;cience adorn the civilized world. The Philo&s;opher in his clo&s;et, the travel|ler on his voyage, and the man of bu&s;i|ne&s;s at his fire-&s;ide, will always find M'FINGAL, an in&s;tructive friend, and a plea&s;ant companion.</P>
<P>The Editors have taken particular pains, to render this edition, worthy of public patronage. The explanatory notes will give this impre&s;&s;ion a great advantage over any American edition. Indeed with|out them, many pa&s;&s;ages alluding to lo|cal cu&s;toms, or de&s;criptive of local tran&s;ac|tions, could not be under&s;tood by a great proportion of readers.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Plates</HI> added to this edition, are an improvement on all former ones,
<PB N="vii" REF="029659_0007_0FE212AFF0FE30C8">
and cannot &s;ail to give it a decided pre|ference.</P>
<P>In every re&s;pect the Editors flatter them|&s;elves, the elegance of the work will do ju&s;tice to this admired Poem; and they confide in the liberality of their country|men, to give due encouragement to this &s;pecimen of American genius and indu&s;try.</P>
<P>THE Notes in this Edition marked with in|verted Commas, were in&s;erted by the Author in the fir&s;t Edition; tho&s;e that are not &s;o marked, are principally extracted and altered from a London Edition, Printed in the Year 1792.</P>

<P>On the fir&s;t of May, 1775, the king's &s;tandard was to be erected at Worce&s;ter, fifty miles from Bo&s;ton, when Lieutenant Colonel Ne&s;bitt immortalized him&s;elf by executing this plan to promote the quarrel, and give the army an opportunity of their de&s;ired revenge.</P>
<P>A &s;oldier, according to his directions, &s;old an old ru&s;ty mu&s;ket to a countryman for three dollars, who brought vegetables to market. This could be no crime in the market-man, who had an undoubted right to purcha&s;e, and bear arms. He was, notwith&s;tanding, immedi|ately &s;eized by Ne&s;bitt, and conveyed to the guard-hou&s;e, where he was confined all night. Early the next morning they &s;tripped him naked, covere him with warm tar, and then with feathers, and conducted him to the north end of the town, then to the &s;outh end, and as far as Liberty-Tree, where they di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the man, through fear of the people, (who by this time had collected in large numbers,) and made a retreat to their barracks.</P>
<P>The party con&s;i&s;ted of about thirty grenadiers of the 47th regiment with fixed bayonets, 20 drums and fifes playing the rogue's march, headed by Ne&s;bitt with a drawn &s;word.</P>
<P>The magi&s;trates of the town waited on General Gage with a com|plaint of this outrage; he pretended di&s;approbation; but took no &s;teps to cen&s;ure the conduct of Ne&s;bitt, or to do ju&s;tice to the man who had &s;uffered the violence.</P></NOTE>,</L>
