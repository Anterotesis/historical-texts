saved, Sirs, if there be any business in this World, that lies upon our hands that is necessary to be done, this is it.</P>
<P N="4">4. This Work that God Commands you to do, it is a Soul work: And I am sure that <HI>soul work</HI> should not be delayed: <HI>Soul-work</HI> should be done with all possi|ble speed O that you would resolve and say, <HI>It is my Soul that must be Dammed or Saved; therefore I will make haste! It is my Soul that must go to Heaven or Hell therefore I will make haste to look after the Salvation of my Soul.</HI> Thou hast but one Soul, one only soul: Wilt thou make haste to feed thy Body, when hungry? Wilt thou make haste to quench thy Thirst, when dry? And to send for a Physician, when in danger of Death, and to cry out to those about thee, <HI>O stay not, make haste, bring him away quickly</HI> and yet in the <HI>mean</HI> while never think of thy soul? Is thy Body better then thy Soul? Is not thy Soul far the Better? Wilt thou take care to feed and cloath the Body, and delay the getting an Interest in Christ to save thy Soul? Why so careful for a dying body, that within a little while shall be nothing but a lump of lifeless dust? I do not you know that e're long men shall

carry your bodies on their shoulders to the grave, and lay them in the dust, to have them rotten? What! will you take such care to make provision for a cor|ruptible Body, and yet neglect your Souls! What mean you, Sirs! What mean you! What ails men, that they dally thus with themselves? Are they besides their Wits!</P>
<P N="5">5. And lastly, if you think nothing that has been said is worth regarding, yet I pray consider the work that God Com|mands you to mind in this World, it is a Work for Eternity! And wilt thou put it off for another year, Month, or Week! Do you think, Sirs, that a short <HI>Life</HI> upon <HI>Earth</HI> is not time little <HI>enough</HI> to prepare for an eternal life, for <HI>an endless</HI> eternity! is a few years too much to be spent with all diligence, that thou mayest be ready for an everlasting State, to which thou art a hastning. Beloved Hearers, you and I are all before God this day, but how soon, we may be in a <HI>unalterable</HI> estate is unknown to us; you are now in Time, to morow you may be in <HI>Eterni|ty:</HI> you may be in an everlasting state What, and yet make no more haste!

before you, what! and yet delay! What! At the brink of <HI>an Everlasting State,</HI> and make no more <HI>haste</HI> to do what <HI>God</HI> has <HI>Commanded</HI> thee! Remember man, re|member, it is <HI>Heaven</HI> that must be <HI>lost</HI> or <HI>won</HI> for ever! It is Eternal Joy, that thou must have, or go without when|ever you shall leave this World! It is Everlasting Torments or Everlasting Blessedness that you must enter into, when you leave this World: Yet will you not make haste to do that Work, that God Commands you to do! Arise Sinner in the Name of God, Awake, be up and doing, as thou lovest thy Soul: Make haste, Sinner, make haste, begin to day, before to morrow: Begin this hour, before the next, to do the Work that God Commands thee; for all the time that is before thee, is little enough to do it in.</P>
<P N="1">1. This Work, Sirs, that God Com|mands you to do, must be now done, or never. What, and yet sit still, and yet daily! It must be now, or never.

in this World to make preparation for another. God has set us in this Life, that we may make ready for another. We are in this world upon tryal, and ac|cording as we behave our selves and mind our work, or let it alone, so it must be with us for ever. This World is the place, this Life the time, when work for Heaven must be done or never be done. <HI>Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in the grave, whi|ther thou goest,</HI> Eccles 9 10.

<P><HI>First</HI> it is plainly said, that thou art going to thy Grave; thou art upon thy Journey to thy Grave: Thou art upon thy way to the dust. Whether thou art sleeping or waking, thou art going to thy Grave. Whether working or play|ing thou art going to thy Grave. Whe|ther drinking or sporting, thou art go|ing to thy Grave.

<P N="2"><PB N="23" REF="039357_0036_1013FED7D6CB8A70">
2. In the Grave there is no work to be done; no Preaching there, nor no Means nor helps there. Of which more hereafter.</P>
<P N="3">3. Therefore it follows, that what now thou hast to do, it should be done with all thy might, and with all haste and possible speed. What thou hast in <HI>thy hand to do, do it with all thy might, for there is no work to do in the Grave to which thou art a going.</HI> Jesus Christ did work the more because his Time was but short, <HI>I must work the work of him that sent me, whilst it is day; for the night com|eth wherein no man can work.</HI> Behold your day is passing away! The Night is coming on! O do your work whilst the day lasts, for when the night com|eth no man can work. You must Re|pent savingly now, or never! You must Believe on Christ now, or never! You must be made holy and become the Children of <HI>God</HI> now, or never! O, methinks, these words, <HI>Now or Ne|ver.</HI> should Alarum the most drousie Sinner! But to set home this, <HI>that what God commands must be done Now, or Never,</HI> I shall lay before you these Seven things.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="24" REF="039357_0037_1013FED95B63A478">
1. After Death there shall be no offers of Mercy, nor tenders of Pardon to all Eternity, therefore now, or never You must <HI>now</HI> do what God Commands, or not at all. Now God he calls and Christ he calls, and the Spirit he calls, and Mi|nisters they call, <HI>That thou wouldest leave thy Sin:</HI> But if thou stop thine ears and harden thy heart till death, after death none of these shall call to thee for ever|more! God did never send to Damned Souls; What say you now, will you ac|cept of Mercy now, will you have a Sa|viour now, and hearken to God now? No, God never took this course as yet, and God will never do it.</P>
<P N="2">2. After Death there i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> no Repentance nor Believing; therefore this must be done now, or never. When Death hath shut thine Eyes, and separated thy Soul from thy Body, if thou diest an Unbe|liever, thou never afterwards shalt have Faith. If thou diest Impenitent, thou never afterwards shalt Repent. Possi|bly Damned Souls may Repent in Hell that they did not Repent upon Earth; but Repentance in Hell, is but the <HI>ag|gravation</HI> of their Misery, it being fruit|less Repentance. What think you wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">
<PB N="25" REF="039357_0038_1013FEDADF4D4288">
they that would never be good whilst they lived, be good in Hell! It is true, there are many sins that men commit on Earth, that they shall not commit in Hell: The Drunkard there shall be no more Drunk: The Gamester there shall have no more jolly bouts; there|fore Now, or Never.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Soul after Death enters into an everlasting State, where there shall be no alteration for ever; therefore what you do for your Souls, must be done Now, or Never. The Soul, when gone into another World, where is first takes its Lodgings, it will be for ever. There once damn'd, and for ever damned! Once in Hell, and for ever there; therefore it must be Now, or Ne|ver. If a man in an <HI>Unconverted</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> should dye to day, and <HI>tidings</HI> be <HI>brought</HI> to you to <HI>morrow,</HI> What is become of his Soul? The <HI>tidings</HI> would be, such a one is <HI>Dead,</HI> and <HI>Damned</HI> too. Yea see the Soul enters into an Everlasting state. <HI>Luk.</HI> 16. 22, 23.

<P N="4">4. When a Man dies, <HI>Wrath</HI> and Ju|stice take their turns, and whilst a Man lives, Mercy and Patience do take their turns; Beloved Hearers, the Attributes of God, as I may so speak, take their turns now <HI>Mercy</HI> and <HI>Patience</HI> take their turns. Mercy takes its turn, and says, <HI>Sinner, thou art undone: Here is a Christ for thee. Thou art miserable, come to me, and I will help thee.</HI> This is Mercy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s turn, but the Soul does not yet regard there|fore <HI>Patience</HI> takes its turn, and says till the next Lord's Day; it may be, the sin|ner will be wise then; it not, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> stays another it may be, the <HI>sinner</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> bethink himself then, and it may be, Patience waits from one Year, to ano|ther; from one ten years to another ten years; Yes, the sinner does not hearken nor regard. Then, when the Soul se|parated from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Body, Wrath</HI> and <HI>Justice</HI> take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> says Mercy, <HI>her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> this than Christ e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">en as long as he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, yet I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"></HI> And says <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, <HI>Lord, where the Sinner keps his eyes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

<P N="5">5. Stay a little longer in thy sins, till <HI>Death</HI> hath closed thy Eyes; then thy Crys and Calls, and Importunities for Mercy shall never be heard; God will then become a God not to be intreated. Now, if you beg for Mercy, you may have it. If you beg and cry, and call for Pardon to <HI>God,</HI> upon the conditions of the Gospel, you may have it, but refuse a little longer, then if thou cryest to all Eternity thy Cries shall never be heard, nor regarded: See this, <HI>Mat.</HI> 25. 1. 2, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, &amp;c <HI>Lord, Lord, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">en to us.</HI> No, says Christ, not I <HI>Luk.</HI> 13 25, 26.

Shew me the place if thou canst; then let God alone, and Christ alone, so long as thou hast leave from God so to do; no, but this thou canst not: Will the Blessed and Holy God give you time to rebel against him?

<P N="5">5. The last reason is this, There is no room for your <HI>Deliberation</HI> in this cause,

whether you will obey the <HI>Commands</HI> of God or no, and <HI>consequently</HI> there can be no room for delay; there is no time to be spent, whether you should keep Gods Command or no. <Q>There are some things that do not come under mens delibe|ration, to spend any time to deliberate whether we are to do them or no.</Q></P>
<P>As for Instance, which of you do deli|berate <HI>whether</HI> you shall <HI>Eat</HI> or <HI>Drink</HI> or no: No man <HI>would,</HI> but for quantity or quality, you may <HI>deliberate,</HI> but whether <HI>Eat</HI> or <HI>Drink</HI> at all, you must not delibe|rate. So the <HI>Ultimate</HI> End of man comes not under mans deliberation. No man deliberates whether he shall be happy or no. Now such is your obedience to the Commandments of God. 'Doing that which he <HI>Commands</HI> you to do, will your spend time to deliberate whether the blessed God should be beloved or no: Will you spend time to <HI>deliberate</HI> whe|ther the blessed <HI>Saviour</HI> shall be believed on or no?

<P>Must the Commandments, of God be kept without delays With all earnest haste and possible <HI>Speed,</HI> Oh then Belov|ed Hearers&punc; Be exhorted in the fear of God, without delay, to set about the Work that God commands you to do.

O the blindness of Mens hearts, that make more haste to Damn their Souls, than to Save them; that make more haste to hell, than to hea|ven; that make more haste to Devils, than to God!

the blessed God made haste to help him out.

<PB N="55" REF="039357_0068_1013FF26873E33C8">
near to Heaven or Hell, and yet wilt thou make no more haste?</P>
<P N="2">2. This little time that thou hast, it is hastning away quickly. O how swift does yonder Sun in the Firma|ment move! Sirs do you not see how one Day and one Night <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ouls away af|ter another, and one Week, one Sab|bath goes away after another, and thy time is a hastning, whether thou art a Drinking, or a Sporting? Sinner, except thou canst stop the Suns go|ing of its Race, stay in thy Sins no longer.</P>
<P N="3">3. This hastning time it is very un|certain too, when it shall end, when an end shall be put unto it; Sinner, canst thou tell, that thou shalt live till to Morrow; let the man stand forth, that can say, I am sure I shall live till to Morrow; which is the man amongst you all that can say, This hour I am sure of the next, and this Lord's Day, that can say, I am sure of another? Who knows, but thou art keeping thy last Sabbath, and hearing thy last Sermon? Who knows, but thou art making the last appearance in a publick Congrega|tion? <HI>Boast not thy self of to Morrow, for
<PB N="56" REF="039357_0069_1013FFF5B6608458">
thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nowest not what a Day may bring forth.</HI> Ah Sinner, thou will be found to be the <HI>Tool</HI> of all <HI>Fools,</HI> that dost not know how <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> thou mayest depart this World, yet to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and delayest, and will not make haste to come to God.</P>
<P N="4">4. Thy time that is past, will never come again; if thou wouldest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> thou|sands for Yesterday, it cannot be Re|called: Or for last Lord's day, it cannot be Recalled again: Consider your time, then judge if it be not high <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> for you to make haste, and to delay no longer.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. Yet I pray you consider all the time you no delay, you are abusing the Mercy of God, and busing of the Pa|tience of God; Is this a thing to delay in? Does the Eternal God may yet does not Damn thee, and call thee down to Hell, which he may do every Hour at his Pleasure? And does he tarry and not Punish thee? And dost thou tarry and wilt not come and submit to him? This God is intreating of thee to accept of <HI>Mercy,</HI> and is loth that thou shouldst Perish, or lose thy poor Soul. Now is offering of the Rich Blessings, Purcha|sed so dear, as by the blood of his own Son; and while thou dost neglect,
<PB N="57" REF="039357_0070_1013D72F091D11A0">
What dost thou but say in thy heart <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> care not for God, nor for his Christ neither? Ah Sinner, remember the time is coming, the hour is hastning, that thou wouldst give Ten <HI>Thousand</HI> Worlds if thou hadst them, for that Grace which now thou despisest, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7. <HI>despisest thou the goodness of God, not considering that the Patience and Long suffering of God should lead thee to repentance!</HI></P>
<P N="9">IX. Thy Delaying has in it a great deal of bold, and blind Presumption. Thou dost presume, Sinner, of such things that thou hast not any grounds to make reckoning of. There are three or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> things that a trifling Sinner, a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Sinner Presumes of.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Thou dost presume that thou shall live danger yet; thou do presume, that thou hast more time to spene in this World; thou dost suppose that thou mayst have another Year yet, another Month <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> another Weeks still; Tell me it this be not in thy Heart? Thou art worse than a mad man indeed, that wilt not make haste &amp; come to Christ? but this is a bold presumption; thou talkest of another Year, when thou mayst not have another Hour.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="58" REF="039357_0071_1013FF29D2F23070">
2 Thou dost presume, that thou canst Repent when thou wilt, and turn to God when thou wilt; thou dost presume that thy own will is of thy own strength; but Sinner, either thou canst Repent when thou wilt, or thou canst not, if thou canst and dost not, behold thou art inexcusable; but if thou canst not Repent now, dost thou think thou canst better Repent hereafter, when thou hast hardened thy Heart yet more in Sin?</P>
<P N="3">3 In thy Delaying, thou dost pre|sume, that the Spirit of God will help thee hereafter, as well as now, for if this were not in thy hopes, if thou didst not suppose this, if thou wert not be|reaved of thy Understanding, Wouldst not thou Repent now, while the Spirit of God moves upon thy heart? How dost thou know, but hereafter the Spi|rit of God may let thee alone, and give thee up to the hardness of thy own Heart? God may say to thee, as to <HI>Ephraim,</HI> Hosea 4 17, <HI>Ephraim is joyned to Idols, let him alone.</HI> Ah Sinner, if God says once, <HI>Let him alone,</HI> then all the Ser|mons in the world will do no good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> If God would say to the delaying Sin|ner, <HI>My Spirit let him alone, and mine Or|dinance

let him alone, and my Ministers let him alone;</HI> That tho you have the voice of the Gospel in your Ears, yet God will let thy heart alone.</P>
<P N="10">X. And the last <HI>Argument</HI> to persuade you to make haste, is this, it may be you may be loth to hear it; I wish, Sinner, that by the yielding to all the rest, thou wouldest give me Reason to for bear to speak it; but if all that has been said, will not move thee to make haste, then know that thy Damnation is hasten|ing, the time of thy lying in Torment is hastening, the hour of thy being thrown down to Devils, and lying in Chains of Darkness, is hastening. Sin|ner, tho thou slumberest, yet thy Dam|nation does not slumber, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2 3. <HI>Whose judgment now of a long time linger|eth not, and there Damnation lingereth not.</HI> Thou lingerest and loyterest, ay, but thy Damnation does not slumber, <HI>Deut.</HI> 32. 35. Consider of that place, <HI>To me</HI> says God, <HI>belongeth Vengeance and Recom|pence; their scot shall slide in due time, for the day of their Calamity is at hand, and the things that shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> upon thee maketh haste.</HI> Mark, the Day of thy Calamity is at hand, and the
<PB N="60" REF="039357_0073_1013FF2EBB4DF9F0">
thing the Wrath of God that shall come upon thee maketh haste; the Justice of God that shall overtake thee, makes haste. O then, if thou wouldst make haste to escape, those dreadful things that are hastening, do you make haste and delay not to keep the Command|ments of your God.</P>
<P>Thus I have given you many Argu|ments and Motives; and if I thought that you had made haste &amp; come away to Christ, I would change my Text and go upon another Subject, but I could after all, that thou art lingring; I would therefore yet try to put thee on, and would direct this Exhortation to five sorts of People.</P>
<P>First of all, I would perswade such of you as are Young, that you would make haste and not delay, even you that are Children, little Children, the young|est amongst you that understand what the sense is of any of these things.

<P N="2">II. I would direct this <HI>Exhortation</HI> to such of you as are old, old Sinners, for <HI>Gods</HI> sake make haste, you that are three|score years old and more, make haste.</P>

<P N="5">V. To such of you as have been Sick, and now are Well, as have been upon beds of Sickness near to Death, but God hath set thee upon thy Legs again. O make haste, and do not delay to keep the Commandments of God.</P>
<P>First then, You that are young, you that are yet in your Childhood, you young Children, you Young men and Maids; O do you make haste, and do not delay to keep the Commandments of God. I would rather press this Coun|sel upon you, because you chiefly lie un|der the temptations of delay; for you Children have very naughty hearts, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> loth to be good, and come to God; you are apt to think, that you have time enough yet: that you may take your Pleasure and mind your sports now, &amp; think of God hereafter, and think of Heaven and Hell hereafter.

that there is no <HI>Reason</HI> for you to delay, though you are young.</P>

<P N="2">II Are you so young that you may not be damned? Has God any where told you in his Word, that no Young Ones shall go to Hell, those that die in their Youth? Tell me, were not you born in Sin? And are you not by Na|ture Children of Wrath? And by rea|son

<P N="5">V. Is not Youth, &amp; Young in Years, the usual time for God to Convert Sin|ners to his Son? especially, those whom he plantech under the Gospel in the time of their Youth. O you that are set under preaching, if you are not con|verted whilst you are young, it is a thousand to one, if ever you are Con|verted Pray Sirs, consider, Is it usual for God to Convert Old Sinners? I know, God sometimes may call at the Eleventh Hour, but it is but here and there one, now and then one &punc; &amp; commonly they are such as did not sit under the means of

Grace when they were Young; if you delay whilst Young, you may let slip the very season of Conversion, then your Souls cannot be brought over to God by all the Preaching in the World. Do we not amongst our selves observe, that for one Old Person, one Old Sinner, that is made sensible of sin, and of his lost estate, though never so vile, that does desire the Prayers of a Congrega|tion for them, have we not Twenty, yea Forty that are younger, that desire your Praises for them?</P>
<P N="6">VI. Will it not be easier, for you to re|pent now, than it will be hereafter, when by long continuance in sin, you have hardned you clears, and seared your Consciences and have been accustomed to do wickedly? Certainly, now, whilst Conscience is tender, and the Heart more tender, it will be easier for you to let go your sin now, and to have your Wickedness now, than it will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">orty years hence; for the longer you con|tinue in no, the stronger is Sin upon you, and the stronger your Sin is, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> your Heart is, and the harder wast he your Repentance, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> speaks, <HI>Can the Ethiopian change his skin,

Will God glorifie you hereafter in Heaven, and will not you glorifie God whilst you are here upon the Earth? Tell me, Do you think you can honour God in a little time, and in Old Age too; as you may in a great deal, begin|ning from your youth, to your Elder years? I tell you, that Multitudes of good People upon their Death Beds when they have been going to Heaven, They have been full of Grief upon this account, That they served God so law, and loved God so late; that are going to Heaven to live with God, and have done no more for God when they were here upon Earth.</P>

in all this time! O you that are Young, for you are my hopes! I profess that I have more hope of you, than of those that are Old &amp; Wicked. I take it to be my great advantage, that I Preach to so many that are young; think of what has been said to you, &amp; what has been spoken to you, and when you come home, consider, you have heard Ten Things, that there is no room for loyter|ing; and you that are Old, if you are not past feeling, O would to God you were not. This is the Mischief, when People are young, then they think it is too soon; and when they are old, then they say, they have been of this Opinion ever since they were born, and change now they will not. Well, think what you will, change you must, or you must be Condemned. You would think it much to wait upon a Fellow Creature a Day, or Week; yet this Blessed God has waited upon you so many Years, O make haste and come unto God, and do not delay any longer.</P>
<P N="3">III. Then to you that are of a strong and a healthful Constitution, do you make haste and not delay to do what God commands you, though you are

<P>First of all, As strong and as stout as thou thinkest thou art, many have been cut off in a Weeks time, and less; therefore do thou make haste; as strong as thou art; when Death comes it will make thee cry out, <HI>O I am Sick, I am Sick; I am Pained, I am Pained!</HI> O it will make thee to Tremble: You see often times that Crazy Persons do out live those that are of a Healthful Constitution; therefore do not venture your Soul Eternal State upon it because you are strong.</P>
<P N="2">II. Tell me, Who is it that giveth thee thy strength? Is it God, or Satan? If <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> God that gave thee thy strength; What a disingenious sinner art thou to God, that because God does not fill thy

<P N="3">III. Consider, which is the fittest time for you to Repent, and to make your Peace with God, now when you are well and strong, or when you shall be sick and near Death? Alas! How oft have I seen people on their sick-Beds unfit to be discoursed with, that put off their Repentance till the last, till they were sick; then sickness brought its Burthen with it, its Excessive Pain with it that they had no mind to Discourse of any such Things. That is the Third Sort; to those that are strong.</P>
<P N="4">IV. My Exhortation also is to such of you as are sickly and of a weak Tem|per, that the often sick, and often ill. It is time for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to make haste, that live in daily expectation of another World, that daily look for your last Day, and when your last Hour will come, and when you shall draw your last Breath.

The Voice of every Sickness is, <HI>Sinner, make haste;</HI> The Voice of every Affliction is, <HI>Sinner, make haste.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. And Lastly, My Advice is to such as have been Sick, and now are Reco|vered; do you make haste &amp; not delay to do what God has commanded you to do; Will you sin again as you did be|fore? Will you slight <HI>Christ</HI> again, as you did before? and neglect <HI>Heaven,</HI> and <HI>God,</HI> and <HI>Christ</HI> as before?

Therefore, you that have been upon the brink of the Grave, and God bid thee look into Eternity, &amp; thou sawest thou wast not prepared, thou beggest a little longer time, &amp; God spared thee, there|fore now make haste.</P>
<P>Now it may be thought, that I have said enough upon this Subject; but, alas, I think I have never said enough upon any Subject, till I have gained your Hearts to do what I have Preached up|on; when consider, how slothful ma|ny Men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> backward to come to God and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, how backward to Be|lieve to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and be Holy, I think that there is Reason enough to consi|der <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> said, to press you to make haste, and I beseech you
<PB N="82" REF="039357_0095_1013FF66A06040F8">
to Answer these following Questions, and let Conscience answer as we go along.</P>
<P>First of all, Tell me, Sinner, Who is it that does wait upon thee, while thou dost delay? Is it not the Blessed, and Glorious, and Eternal God? Is it not he that the Angels of Glory make all possible speed to do his commands? Is it not he, Sinner, that might have Dam||ned thee long ago, and cast thee down into Eternal Torments, and thou might|est this day have been among Damned Devils? Dost thou do well to make him carry for thee? Is it not he, that Died for thee, that is infinite in Mercy to save thee, if thou comest in; that is Infinite in Power to Damn thee, if thou refuse? Is it not he, that is infinitely thy Supe|riour Judge? Now, if it be reason for thee to loyter any longer, do if thou darest; do I say at thy Peril.</P>
<P>Secondly, Who, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> thou, Trifler, that this Blessed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> should wait thus upon thee? If <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> consider thee as thou a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Creature, or as thou art <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, why should God so wait upon thee one year after another?

made of dust, and must not thy Body e're long be turned into dust? What art thou, but the better sort of Clay?

Canst thou be happy without his Favour, and enter into Heaven without his Son, and be saved without his Mercy? Therefore delay any longer at thy Peril.</P>
<P>Thirdly, What is it for, that this God thus waits upon thee? Consider I pray you, What does God give you so much time for, one Week after ano|ther, one Month after another, Year after year? Is it not to make your selves Rich in this World? O no, it is about a greater Matter that God waits and stays? Is it not to see if thou wilt mind thy escaping Eternal Damnation!

Dost thou Stay to see if God will make such Laws as shall be pleasing to thee, that thou <HI>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">t</HI> keep thy Sins and go to Hea|ven too? Flatter not thy self, he will never do it; If thou <HI>stayest</HI> forty Years longer, the Laws of God will be the same then, as now, the Commands of <HI>God</HI> will be the same then as now. If thou <HI>stayed</HI> Forty Years longer, thou <HI>must</HI> Repent at <HI>last,</HI> or thou must be damned at <HI>last;</HI> thou <HI>must</HI> believe at <HI>last,</HI> or thou <HI>must</HI> go to

You must not think to dally with <HI>God,</HI> as with <HI>Men</HI> in the Market.

<P>Thirdly, Consider this too, and let thy Conscience reply whether thou dost well or no. Tell me, while thou dost delay, dost not thou do worse with the Blessed God, than thou dost with Damn|ed Devils? I say, deal worse with God. Do you loiter thus when the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> calls? Do you delay thus, when the Devil Tempts you; Hast not thou the very same day that the Temptation has been laid before thee, yielded un|to it without delay, and hearkened to the voice of the Tempter?

<P>Fifthly, Tell me, delaying Sinner, Tell me, in all Cases that concern thee in

this World. Art not thou for the pre|sent time? If thou art sick, wouldst not thou be presently well? If in Pain, wouldst thou not have present ease? When thou art Sick, if it be told thee, that thou canst not have ease this Twelve Months, or Three or Four Months, yet would not this be tedious for thee to consider? Tell me, Art not thou for Riches presently? Wouldst not thou be quickly Rich? Wouldst not thou have a great deal of the World, thou carest not how soon? Or if thou wast in danger of Death, or of thy Grave, how soon wouldst thou he help|ed, or delivered? And though thou art in Danger of Hell, thou makest no haste to be delivered.

What to do in this World more than to get off the guilt of Sin, to get a holy Heart? And yet to delay! Thou dost put all to a Hazard. Me|thinks your delaying to do what <HI>God</HI> commands, it is a putting of things to a venture, it is a putting your Salvation to a venture, it is a putting of your Damnation to a venture, it is a putting the Loss of <HI>God,</HI> and of <HI>Christ</HI> to a ven|ture.

If thou dost not leave thy Drunken|ness, and thy Uncleanness, and thy Wickedness, thou shalt not enter into Heaven. Why then dost not thou let it go? If thou lovest Christ indeed, why then dost not thou receive Christ into thy Heart? Wilt thou pretend that thou lovest Christ, when thou wilt not have him come under the Roof of thy Heart?</P>
<P>Eighthly, Tell me, Are not delays in these Cases, Arguments of great Folly? And is it not a sign of greatest Wisdom for a Man (in such Cases as these are) to make the greatest haste? Is not he a Madman, or a Fool, that mindeth Toys or Trifles when he is in danger of losing his Life? Sirs, Are not you worse when you mind the Toys and Pleasures below, when you are in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of losing Souls.</P>
<P>There are five Arguments to prove a Wise Man.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="101" REF="039357_0114_1013FF97F4ACB5F0">
1. That he be one that maketh choice of the best good.</P>
<P N="2">2. That he be one that taketh care of the best part.</P>
<P N="3">3. That he be one that walketh in the best way.</P>
<P N="4">4. That he be one that useth the best Means.</P>
<P N="5">5. That he be one that doth all these.</P>
<P>In the first place, this is the Wise Man, Behold, God is the best good, thy Soul is the best part, the way of Holiness is the best way, means appointed by God to get to Heaven, are the only means. But on the contrary, to neglect these it is a sign of the greatest Folly? Wilt thou do it still? Venture on at thy Peril.</P>
<P>Ninthly, Tell me, Do not the De|lays of People greatly discourage the Faithful Ministers of the Gospel? Does not your delaying weaken our Hands, and discourage our Hearts, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> must Study for you, and pray for you, and Preach to you, and you cast it again
<PB N="102" REF="039357_0115_1013FF9978842B90">
in our Faces? do you think, that we can Preach with Life, when we see no Fruit of our Works? I profess, were it not for some of you, you would even tempt me to Preach no more to you, were it not the Command of God to continue my duty. You see, <HI>Isa 49 4 Then I said, I have laboured in vain, and have spent my strength for nought and in vain;</HI> When he could not see the fruit of his Preach|ing. So Ministers may say, <Q>Lord, we have laboured in vain, and have spent our strength for nought, and in vain.</Q> <HI>Jerem</HI> 20 8, 9 <HI>For since I spake, I cried out, I cried Violence and Spoil, because the Word of the Lord was made a Reproach unto me: Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his Name.</HI> And by your delaying, when we come Year after Year, and Preach Month after Month, and see many of you in your Sins still, and walk in your wicked ways; Do you think that this is not a great Discouragement unto Ministers? And do you think, that God will not lay this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> your Change, to weaken the hands of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Servants? Do it at your Peril.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="039357_0116_1013FF9C3B54A110">
Tenthly, and Lastly, Dost not thou think, O delaying Trifler! Dost not thou know, that every thing that thou settest thy Heart upon, is hastening from thee, and every thing thou lovest is hastening away, and yet, wilt not thou make haste to get something that thou mayst need, when all that now thou lov|est will leave thee? Sinner, Dost not thou know, that thy time is a going, thy Health is a going, and that thy Life is a going; and yet wilt not thou make haste?

<P>Thus you see, I have given you Ten Questions more; Has this done the Work? Are you now resolved to go home, and enter into Covenant so be the Lords? Are you now resolved to forsake your Sins &amp; to let go your Ini|quities? I doubt you are not; some of you will keep your Sins still, and will not come to God. Possibly, there are Two Things secret in thy Heart, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> remove these that bear thee up in thy

delay. Possibly thou thinkest, Why Sir, why such haste? Is not God a mer|ciful God, a long suffering God? Is not God ready to forgive, and has he not promised so to do? And if I repent hereafter, God will Pardon me hereaf|ter? Why such haste then? I answer.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is true, Sinner, that God is a merciful God, else Wo would have been thy Case long ago. It is true, God is a Patient God, a long suffering God, else thou wouldst not have been hearing of a Sermon now, but have been amongst Devils and Damned Souls at this time: But what if it be so, and thou misera|ble? But I Answer particularly: Tell me,</P>
<P>First, Art thou sure that thou shalt see that time, when thou dost purpose to Repent? If so be that the Devil, or thine own Heart would delude thee, now thou art young, to Repent when thou art a Man, Art thou sure to live till thou become a man? If not, where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> thy Soul be then? Is it not then bet|ter to Repent now without delay?</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="039357_0118_1013FFA133C4EA18">
Secondly, Art thou sure to have the same means of Grace then as now?</P>
<P>Thirdly, Art thou sure that the <HI>Spi|rit</HI> of God will strive upon thy Heart, and move upon thy Heart then, as now he does? If thou art not sure, be not de|ceived; for though God be patient, yet he may cut in two the Thread of thy Life, before thou seest those days where in thou purposedst to Repent.</P>
<P>Fourthly, I suppose all to be true, that thou may if live longer, and thou mayst Repent at last, and God Pardon thy sin at last? What then? Is this thy Inge|nuity, to Sin against God now, because thou hopest that God will be gracious and Merciful to thee hereafter? I thought, thou hadst been a more In|genious Person: Wouldst thou deal thus with a Friend, with a Man? But you say, what need such haste? Some Repent at the Eleventh Hour; all do not Repent while Young. To this I Answer.</P>
<P N="2">II. If some are then brought in, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it is not all that do stand out till then?
<PB N="106" REF="039357_0119_1013FFA3AB45F120">
No, it is but very few; it is a very rare thing to see Persons Converted, and brought home to Christ at the Eleventh Hour. Sometimes God may do this, and truly, it is but sometimes. Pray, how many is it that you know, that were Converted when they were Old, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ate under the means of Grace while they were Young? I suppose you can tell but of very few. It is but now and then, and wilt thou put it to a Hazard, whether God will make thee such an Example? I could never find it Recorded in the Scripture, but of one Man, that was Converted at last, and that was the Thief upon the Cross? I do not say, there was no more, but no more Recorded, <HI>Matth.</HI> 20. 6, 7. You Object, that some came in at the Eleventh Hour; I pray view that Scrip|ture, that is, Those that came in at the Eleventh Hour, they were not Called till the Eleventh Hour; Those that were called the Third Hour, came in the Third Hour; And those that were Called the Sixth Hour, came in the Sixth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and those that were Called the Ninth hour, came in the Ninth hour;
<PB N="107" REF="039357_0120_1013FFA6F8107678">
but those that came in at the Eleventh hour, they were not called at the Third, nor Sixth, nor Ninth, but at the Ele|venth hour. Now, what is this to you, that have been Called an Hundred Times over, that have had Call after Call, and Invitation after Invitation? For when Men are called at the Third and Sixth Hours and do not come in, they seldom come in at the Eleventh Hour. What say you beloved Hearers, shall I, after these Sermons, and after al|most an hundred things spoken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> you, and all to this purpose to press you to make haste, and not delay, shall I go away from your Presence and your Sight, and will you turn your back up|on God, and say, <HI>Yet a little longer, yet I must enjoy my Pleasure, yet I must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the World:</HI> As if you had no room in your Hearts for God and Christ, or the things above?

First of all, If thou wouldst make haste and now keep God's Commandments thou shouldest be Blessed now, thou shouldest be happy now, and will not this make you to make haste? Tell me, Sirs, Have you a mind to go home Hap|py, to go home with the Love of God? Oh! If you would go Home Happy, Men and Women make haste, delay no longer to keep the <HI>Commandments</HI> of your God. Christ himself pronounceth you Blessed, if you will but do this, <HI>Luk.</HI> 11. 27, 28. <HI>It came to pass as he spoke these things, a certain Woman of the company lift up her Voice to him</HI> (that is, to Christ) <HI>Blessed is the Womb that bare thee, &amp; the Pap that gave thee Suck.</HI> Ah says she, What a Blessed Woman was that, which bore this Man!

Lo|ving of Christ'</HI>s <HI>Person, and keeping of</HI> Christ's <HI>Commandments,</HI> they usually go together. In the Second, <HI>Those that love me, and keep my Commandments.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, If you will but make haste to keep Gods Commandments, and Be|lieve when he Commands, and close with Christ when he Commands, God will make haste, and hear thy Prayer? when thou pourest out thy Prayer to God, <HI>O Lord make haste, &amp; do not tarry;</HI> then God will make haste, &amp; hear thy Prayer.

Sirs, if You would make haste to keep the Commandments of God, God would make haste, and would not stay beyond that Hour that Deliverance should be for thy good.</P>
<P>Fifthly, If you would make haste to keep God's Commandments, it would be the readiest way that you could do, to have a Blessing upon your outward Enjoyments, <HI>Lev.</HI> 26 throughout.</P>
<P>Lastly, If thou wilt do this, thou shalt be saved when thou diest; What dost thou desire more? <HI>John 1. Verily, Verily, I say unto you, if any man keep my Sayings,

<P>Thus in the <HI>Covenant,</HI> you see an in|viting, pleading God; O that now, in the <HI>Congregation,</HI> we could see a co|ming and a Praying Sinner? Oh say therefore, whoever thou art that hast stood out against Terms of Mercy all thy days and wouldst have none of this God for thy God, that never came into thy mind ever since thou wast born, now say, Now Lord I come, Now Lord, since thou art pleased to call and plead with me, behold, I come accor|ding as thou callest.</P>
<P>It would be a lovely sight to see Sin|ners returning to an inviting God; <HI>Jer.</HI> 3. 22. <HI>Return ye backsliding Children, and I will heal your backslidings: behold we come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God</HI> This is the coming of return|ing Sinners; as God hath pleaded with the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, so thou must now go and Plead <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ith God.

Jesus Christ passed by, and looked up to <HI>Zacheus</HI> on the Tree, and bade him to come down; and it is said, That <HI>he made haste and came down,</HI> and followed Christ; God has not only given thee a Call, Sinner, but he has stood waiting and knocking at the Door of thy Heart; but how long hast thou delayed? Thou hast made many a fair Promise, I will Repent, and I will Be|lieve, and take God for my God; but thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> not do it yet; to see any among <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to be hastning towards God, while <HI>God</HI> is waiting upon you: O that would be a joyful sight indeed! Say now, Lord, Lord, thou shalt not wait an hour longer upon me.</P>
<P>Fourthly, it would be a joyful sight to Angels and Men, to see a Promising God, and a Believing Sinner: If this were done, the <HI>Covenant</HI> were made be|twixt God and thy Soul; if as God does Promise, so thou dost believe the Promises, then God would be thy God;

Thus it was with <HI>Abraham,</HI> when God came to make the Covenant with <HI>Abraham, Gen.</HI> 17. 1, 2, &amp;c <HI>And when</HI> Abram <HI>was Ninety Years Old and Nine, the Lord appeared to</HI> Abram, <HI>and said unto him, I am the Al|mighty God, walk before me, and be thou perfect. And I will make my Covenant be|tween me and thee, and will Multiply thee exceedingly And</HI> Abram <HI>fell on his face, and God talked with him, saying, As for me, Behold my Covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a Father of many Nations: Neither shall thy Name any more be called</HI> Abram, <HI>but thy Name shall be called Abra|ham, <HI>for a Father of many Nations have I made thee; &amp; I will make thee exceeding Fruitful, &amp; I will make Nations of thee, and Kings shall come out of thee.

thee and me, and thy seed after thee, in their Generation, for an Everlasting Cove|nant; to be a God unto thee, &amp; unto thy seed after thee. And God said unto</HI> Abraham, <HI>Thou shalt keep my Covenant therefore, thou and thy seed after thee, in their Generation,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>You read there of <HI>God's</HI> coming to <HI>Abraham;</HI> and says he, <HI>I make my Cove|nant with thee; &amp; in thy seed shall all the Nations of the Earth be blessed.</HI> This was a Promise made to <HI>Abraham</HI> when he was Ninety and Nine Years Old; as there was a Promising God, so there was a Believing <HI>Abraham,</HI> Rom. 4 18, 19, 20. <HI>Who against hope, believed in hope that he might become the Father of many Nations; according to that which was spoken, So shall thy Seed be. And being not weak in Faith, he considered not his own Body now Dead, when he was about an Hundred Years Old; nor yet the deadness of</HI> Sarah's <HI>Womb. He staggered not as the Promise of God through unbelief, but was strong in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, giving glory to God.</HI> When a Soul is enabled by God to make applica|tion of the Promises to himself, and
<PB N="121" REF="039357_0134_1013FFC9F75596A0">
being certain then that he is a Believing Sinner, answering to a Promising God.</P>
<P>Fifthly, In order to your becoming a Covenant People, and God your Co|venant God, It would be a joyful fight to Men and Angels, to see a Command|ing God, and an obeying Sinner. In the Covenant there are Commands as well as Promises, therefore they must be performed as a Duty, as well as participated of as a Priviledge, <HI>Deut.</HI> 4. 13 <HI>He declared unto you his Covenant that he commanded you to perform.</HI> This God comes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">rth with a Commanding Voice, as well as with a Pleading, Tendring Voice: Now, as there is a Command|ing Go, so if there were amongst you an obeying Sinner, then the Covenant would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fulfilled, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. 8 <HI>By Faith</HI> Abraham <HI>when he was called to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in|to a place which he should after receive for an Inheritance, obeyed, and he went out, not knowi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> whither he went.</HI> God called him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his Friend, and from his Family, and he knew not whether he was to go; yet he obeyed God. But God has old you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> whither
<PB N="122" REF="039357_0135_1013FFCC5C35BDA0">
you shall go, yet you will not follow him! God has told you, that Heaven shall be the Place, an Everlasting Kingdom; you shall have Mansions above in Bliss, and Glory shall be the Place that God will lead you to, yet you will not obey God.</P>
<P>Sixthly, To see a Threatning God, and a Trembling Sinner; is: very de|lightful fight. Not in it self indeed de|sirable, but in order to your dosing with God upon Covenant terms; for as God does invite a Sinner to take him for his God, and does wait upon him, and does Promise him Heaven, if he will? and as God commands him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> take him for his God, so God does t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">reaten Man too very severely, if he will not come up to Covenant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">. How frequent are these in the Gospel! <HI>He that believeth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> is Condemned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Ex|cept <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> shall Perish <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Holi|ness no man shall see the Lord,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> it be to be his Eternal Sorrow.</P>
<P>You may see a Threatning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> unto those that will not perform is Cove|nant,

<P>Well, but what if Men will not, is there any danger to a Sinner, if he will not take God for his <HI>God?</HI> Ay, that there is, <HI>vers</HI> 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.

<PB N="124" REF="039357_0137_1013FFCFDF760038">
is there any likelihood that a Sinner will take God for his God till he does tremble before this Threatning God; Thy Conscience is sear'd, thou makest nothing to come up to Covenant terms; but where God Threatens, and the Soul Trembles, then it is a sign that that Man will be brought into <HI>Covenant</HI> with God.</P>
<P>Seventhly, It is a Blessed Sight; re|joycing Angels and Men, to see a Bleed|ing Christ, and a Weeping Sinner. In <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Covenant</HI> of Grace, you may see the one Bleeding Christ; for Christ Bled to Confirm the Covenant betwixt God and Man. He is the Mediator of the Covenant, &amp; the Surety of the Covenant, &amp; the <HI>Blood</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> it is the <HI>Blood</HI> of the Everlasting Covenant; so that on the one side, you may see, a Bleeding Christ; but where is the Weeping Sinner? Where is the Broken Hear|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed Sinner? Where is the Contrite, and the Bleeding Sinner? Could we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> see <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the Work were done, God were thy God then, and and then one of his People <HI>Zech</HI> 12 10.

Oh could we but see this, a Weeping Sinner an|swerable to a Bleeding Christ, and, the March would be made, God would, be thy God, and thou one of his Peo|ple.</P>
<P>Eighthly, It would be a Blessed sight, to see a striving Spirit, and a yielding Sinner; and this it must be, if ever God becomes your God, and you his People. There must be both of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> a Striving Spirit moving upon thy Heart, that must solicit thee for thy

<P>Ninthly, It is a blessed sight to see a Preaching Minister, and a serious and a hearkening Sinner.

<P>Tenthly, and Lastly, which is the Fruit of all; It is a Blessed sight to see a Heaven prepared and a Sinner Sa|ved.

<P>Now therefore for God's sake Sin|ner, for God's sake, and for thine own Souls sake, let me beseech thee, and intreat thee, as ever thou wilt find Mercy at the hand of God another day, come and take this God for thy God; come Sinner, come as yet, it is not too late; as yet Mercy may be had; and as yet, Grace may be round; while the day of mercy lasts, and while the day of thy Life, lasts, come in this Instant, and ruin not thy Back and say, For all this, I will keep my Sins still.</P>
<P>Consider this, If thou wilt not have God for thy God, thou wilt be Con|demned by the Covenant of Works,

and thou wilt not be condemned by the <HI>Covenant of Grace.</HI> Think of this, thou art Condemned by the <HI>Covenant of Works;</HI> Gal. 3. 10. <HI>For as many as are of the Works of the Law, are under the Curse; for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the Book of the Law to do them.</HI> Here is thy Doom, <HI>Cursed is every one,</HI> Man, Woman, and Child, every one, Bond and Free, Master and Servant, Husband and Wife; <HI>that continueth, not in all things written in the Book of the Law to do them.</HI> Hast thou done so?

<P>O methinks, I am loth to leave you, till I see some or other strict Covenant with God and say, O I see I must take God for my God, or else, I am lost and undone, and that for ever; I am accursed by the Covenant of Works, and by the Covenant of Grace, the o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e for not Obeying, and the other for not Believing.

before God be his God in <HI>Covenant</HI> will be <HI>cast into a Furnace of Fire,</HI> Matth. 13. 42. Where you see Hell is set forth by a <HI>Furnace of Fire.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Lastly, It is indeed a Place of Tor|ment, <HI>Luk.</HI> 16. 28. Says the Rich Man there, <HI>O send to my Brethren, and tell them what I endure, that they may not come to this place of Torment.</HI> O have mercy on me, for I am Tormented Day and Night. Now what is this, for which you must be cast into such Torments? What for, For refusing of God?</P>
<P>Why art thou so loth, Sinner, why, to take this God for thy God? Why, will he do thee any hart? Besides, I might have shewn how, that Four Things will make your case exceeding woful? for fain I would prevail, though it were but with. One or Two, to come over to God, and that will say, O Sir, I come with all my heart, to take this God for my God.</P>
<P>First of all, If thou wilt not, thy Pains will be Universal Pains, all over <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Body, and all over thy Soul, no part of thy Body free, no part of thy Soul free; hereafter in <HI>Hell Eyes,</HI> and <HI>Head,</HI> and <HI>Heart,</HI> and all the Pains of <HI>Hell</HI> shall be
<PB N="136" REF="039357_0149_1013D72D6EEE2518">
Universal, every part sinned, and every part shall Suffer.</P>
<P>Secondly, They shall be extream too, Sinner. If thou wilt refuse this God to be thy God, he will inflict upon thee ex|tremity of Pain: Now to have Pain all over, and to be all over in extremity, what a sad case is this?</P>
<P>Thirdly, Then they must be conti|nual, without intermission; not some|times in Pain, and sometimes at ease; No, no, this is not the case of the Dam|ned; no, there is no intermission, not for an hour, not for one moment in Hell: If so be you have a pain on your Body for an hour or two, or in the night, and in the morning you have ease, what a refreshment is that? But for a Person to lie under the pain of <HI>Gout</HI> and <HI>Stone,</HI> and Night and Day cryeth out, no ease, no mitigation, not an hours rest all Night long: O consider, what it will be, not to have an hours rest to all Eternity, not the least intermission!</P>
<P>Fourthly, As it shall have no inter|mission, so it shall have no cessation. If it were Pain to continue for a Thousand Years, without an Hours Rest between, yea a thousand to that, &amp; a thousand to
<PB N="137" REF="039357_0150_1013FFF02D9D3348">
that, it would be happy Tidings; but those that will not have God for their God, they must have Pain without ease, and without intermission, and that for ever.</P>
<P>But for one Thing more. Besides all this, Sirs, if you will not have this God for your God, your Covenant <HI>God,</HI> you will have something to Torment you in Hell, that Thousands of others never shall.</P>
<P>Shall I tell you, Beloved Hearers, shall I tell you, you will have something to Torment you, that Devils shall not have. I say, something lie heavier on you than upon Devils; something to Torment you, that the Heathens have not to Torment them: What is that? O it is the gnawings of a never dying Worm, for the refusing of an offered Christ, of Mercy, while Mercy may be had. When you shall lie in Hell, it God does not prevent you, what will be the gnawings of thy Conscience?</P>
<P>Methinks, I hear poor Damn'd <HI>wretches</HI> that have sat under the Gospel, accusing themselves alter this manner; <HI>It was for the breach of the</HI> Covenant of <HI>Works that I am in this place; but I might have had
<PB N="138" REF="039357_0151_1013FFF2967B9998">
help in the Covenant of Grace; God was offered unto me, and Christ was offered unto me, Ministers Pleaded with me day after day; but said Conscience, this thou wouldst not do, thou said No, to thy dying day. Had I accepted of Mercy, while Mercy might have been had, I need not have come into this place of Torment: But alas, wo is me, the Devils above me, never slighted such Mercy as I have done! Wo is me, the Thou|sand of Heathens that are above me, never slighted such Mercy as I have done! A Sa|viour was never offered to Devils; a Saviour was never Preached to the Heathens; But I like a miserable Wretch now, like a Damned Wretch now, might have had mercy, but would not&punc; I might have escaped this Place, but would not&punc; Wo is me now I am lost for e|ver! Wo is me now, I am Damned for ever! My Praying time is gone over! I might have had God to have been my God once, but now he will never be offered to me any more.</HI></P>
<P>Thus look to it, it will be worse with you than with Devils &amp; with Heathens if you refuse to take <HI>God</HI> for your <HI>God,</HI> and you give not up your selves to be his People.</P>
