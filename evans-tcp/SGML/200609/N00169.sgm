<OPENER><SALUTE>Royal Sir.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Most High hath adorned you with an <HI>High Birth,</HI> with a <HI>gallant Temper,</HI> and Endowments of Nature, with <HI>Princely Education,</HI> and <HI>rare Experiences</HI> &amp;c.

<P>Touching this most <HI>holy Spirit,</HI> and other heavenly Points in dif|ference between the <HI>Protestants</HI> and the <HI>Quakers,</HI> I present your roy|al eye with a <HI>Lantskip</HI> of a <HI>Battle</HI> fought this last Summer in your Majestyes <HI>New-England,</HI> between some of the eminentest of the <HI>Quakers</HI> and my self, three dayes at <HI>Newport</HI> on <HI>Rode-Island,</HI> and one at <HI>Providence</HI> on the <HI>Main</HI> in the same <HI>Colony.</HI></P>
<P>I am humbly bold to present it to your <HI>Royal Hand,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. That your own precious <HI>Soul</HI> (infinitely more precious then thousands of <HI>Brittains</HI> or <HI>Worlds</HI> may see the <HI>Grounds</HI> and <HI>Roots</HI> of these <HI>Protestant Disquisitions.</HI></P>

<P N="3"><PB REF="000228_0003_0FA36B7D1531E740">
3. Because your Majestyes <HI>Name</HI> is often mentioned and concer|ned in these <HI>Concertations.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Because it was affirmed by some of my Opposites in publick, that there were scarce any of their <HI>Books</HI> came forth, but the <HI>King</HI> had one: I thought it some obligation on me, to present the <HI>Protestant Truth</HI> (thus publickly and solemnly asserted) more justly then my <HI>Po|pish</HI> and <HI>Arminian Opposites</HI> to offend your Royal eyes with Smoak out of the <HI>Deep Pit.</HI></P>

<P><HI>Charles</HI> the Great was one of the greatest Princes of that name in the world.

<P>By Gods most wise and righteous Permission, the <HI>Pope</HI> and <HI>Qua|kers</HI> pretend their <HI>Enthusiasmes,</HI> and <HI>Infallibilityes:</HI> I know and have detected much of both their <HI>Impostures,</HI> and I beseech him who is the eternal <HI>Pater Luminum,</HI> to preserve your <HI>Royal Spirit</HI> from both their <HI>Cheatings,</HI> that is from the <HI>Oracles</HI> of <HI>Hell</HI> in their mouths.</P>

<HEAD>To the People called Quakers.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Friend &amp; Country-men:</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P N="1">1. THe occasion of these <HI>Discourses</HI> you may see in the first Page: the 14 <HI>Proposals</HI> in the second Page, and the occasion of the Title in the 34.</P>
<P N="2">2. The truth is (as <HI>Edmund Burroughs,</HI> and others of you say of your selves) from my Childhood (now above three|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> years) the Father of <HI>Lights</HI> and <HI>Mercies</HI> toucht my Soul with a love to himself, to his only begotten, the true <HI>Lord Jesus,</HI> to his <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> &amp;c. his infinite Wisdome hath given me to see the City, Court and Country, the Schools and Universities of my <HI>Native Country,</HI> to converse with some <HI>Turks, Jews, Papists,</HI> and all sorts of <HI>Protestants,</HI> and by Books to know the <HI>Affairs</HI> and <HI>Religions</HI> of all <HI>Countries,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="3">3. My Conclusion is, that <HI>be of good chear thy sins are forgiven thee,</HI> Mat. 9. is one of the joyfullest sounds that ever came to poor sinful Ears: how to obtain this sound from the mouth of that Mediatour that spoke it, is the great dispute between the <HI>Protestants</HI> and the bloody <HI>Whore</HI> of <HI>Rome:</HI> this is also the great point between the true <HI>Protestants</HI> and your selves: as also (in order to this) about what Man is (to the utmost) now by nature, what the true Lord Jesus Christ is, and all other controversies (discussed in this Book, not unworthy this your serious weighing (as <HI>Mary</HI> did) in the hearts and spirits, &amp;c:</P>
<P N="4">4. Bear with me while I say, that as the <HI>Jesuites</HI> pretend to deifie the <HI>Pope,</HI> but it is known, the end is to deifie themselves under the cloak of the <HI>Popes</HI> Name: so Satan pretends to exalt and deifie you, under the name of <HI>God,</HI> and <HI>Christ,</HI> and <HI>Spirit,</HI> &amp;c. but his end is as <HI>Peter</HI> tells us, to exalt himself, and fill his hellish Paunch with Souls.</P>
<P N="5">5 I endeavoured, but could not procure a Short-hand writer, so that I am forced to recollect Transactions from my Memory, and I believe (as in the holy presence of God) that I have not failed to present the true sub|stance of passages without advantage to my self, or disadvantage to my Op|posites.</P>
<P N="6">6. I have used some sharp Scripture Language, but not (as commonly you do) passionately and unjustly: I sometimes call you <HI>Foxians,</HI> (as <HI>Ni|colaitans</HI> from <HI>Nicholas</HI>) because <HI>G. Fox</HI> hath appeared the greatest Writer, and the greatest Preacher amongst you, and the most deified that I can hear of, sure it is that here he subtly run for it: he ordered that my Letters to
<PB REF="000228_0005_0FA36C55C91E32B0">
our Deputy Governour Captain <HI>Cranstone</HI> (in which my Proposals to <HI>G. F.</HI> were, should not be delivered to the Deputy, until <HI>G. F:</HI> was some hours under sayle, that he might say he never saw my Paper, though it is as clear as noon-day, that he knew all matters by Copies, Letters and Relations, per|fectly many dayes before his departure.</P>
<P N="7">7. My disadvantage (in our Contests (especially at <HI>Newport</HI>) were great and many: for though <HI>J. Stubs.</HI> and <HI>J. Burnet</HI> were more civil and ingeni|ous: yet <HI>W. Edmondson</HI> was nothing but a bundle of Ignorance, and Boiste|rousness, he would speak first end all (though all three were constantly on me at once) no man might speak at all in favour of my Positions: any might freely speak against them: they sat in the midst of the Governour &amp; Magistrates (of their Opinion) and the whole Assembly (of their way) <HI>W. Edmundson</HI> (though <HI>J. Stubs</HI> twice said in publick, that I had not inter|interrupted them) yet <HI>W. Edmundson</HI> would frequently and insolently in|terrupt me: so that I was not only forced to bear patiently (through Gods only help) but to suppress my thoughts, which here I have added in some places. 8. I know that a great weight of your Opinions and Actings lye upon your believing your selves guided by the immediate Spirit of God: but I believe that I have proved that it is no more the holy Spirit of God, that speaks and acts in you, then it was the true <HI>Samuel</HI> that spake such heavenly words in the appearance of <HI>Sam.</HI> Mantle amongst a cloud of other witnesses you shall never perswade Souls (not bewitched) that the holy Spirit of God would perswade your Women and Maidens to appear in publick (streets &amp; assemblies) stark naked, &amp;c. of which I have spoke more particularly in our disputations. 9. It is hard to perswade a Fox or a Wolf that he is so, &amp;c. or that he doth Rob or Steal, or Murther; it is hard to perswade a man while he dreams that he is in a Dream yea though he be a filthy Dreamer as Gods Spirit speaks: In our Dreams we believe lyes and impossibilities to he true as that we are many thousand miles of, that we talk with dead men, &amp;c. that we are at Marriages or Burials and are Kings and Queens. &amp;c.</P>
<P N="10">10. All that I can hope for (without Gods wonderfull mercy) is to give my Testimony in my generation: for (as <HI>Solomon</HI> speaks of the Whore) few or none of you return. Yet I know Gods foundation is sure he knows who are his amongst you as amongst other perswasions. I have proved, and will prove (if God please) that spiritual Pride, that is Pride about spiritual matters, is the Root and Branch of your whole Religion, and that the King Eternal, who did cast out proud Angels out of his Palace, will hardly open his Gates to proud and scornful Dust and Ashes:</P>

<P><HI>I humbly beg of you.</HI> 1. <HI>That you will more and more earnestly, candidly and christianly study the things that differ without reflecting upon Credit, Mainte|nance, Liberty, and Life it self, remembring who it was that said it:</HI> He that loves his life shall lose it. 2. <HI>More and more to study the Prophesies and the Signs of the Times, You know when it was that five Bishops, twenty two Mini|sters, &amp; almost three hundred other precious Believers in the true Lord Jesus, were sacrificed in the Flames, for his ever blessed sake, against that monstrous Man of Sin and bloudy</HI> Whore of Rome. <HI>These</HI> Foxians <HI>fancy is but a feather to to those high</HI> Pico's <HI>and</HI> Tenariffs, <HI>the</HI> Pope <HI>and</HI> Mahomet <HI>whom some of you may live to see flung into the Lake that burns with Fire and Brimstone.</HI></P>

</LETTER>
<P>Hitherto (gentle <HI>Reader</HI>) have been the <HI>Skirmishings</HI> of my <HI>Forlorn Hope;</HI> I hasten now to the relation of the main <HI>Bat|tle,</HI> for after this my third Letter and <HI>Answer,</HI> I heard no more of that <HI>soul</HI> and <HI>slanderous spirit:</HI> I should rejoice to be instru|mentall to his casting out of my ancient friend <HI>J T.</HI> however he pluckt in his horns as <HI>G Fox</HI> himself did, and I have yet heard no further.</P>
<P>Within some few dayes after that our <HI>Deputy Governour</HI> had
<PB N="23" REF="000228_0029_0FA36C67C7C0E4D0">
delivered my Paper to them, the strange <HI>Quakers</HI> (as was agreed with <HI>G. Fox</HI>) came to <HI>Providence. John Stubs, John Burnes,</HI> and others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The first <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> Pro|vidence of the <HI>Qa</HI> and my self.</NOTE> and came to my house six or seven together: their <HI>Sa|lutations</HI> were (like the meetings of their <HI>dumb spirit</HI>) in silence. I bid them welcome <HI>&amp;c. John Stubs</HI> began and said, they had received a paper from me, and they came to me to tell me, that they accepted my <HI>Offer,</HI> and that they had appointed (according to the liberty given them by my self in my Paper) the 9th. of the present <HI>August</HI> to be the day at <HI>Newport.</HI> I told them they were welcome, and the more welcome because they brought me tidings of their <HI>Resolution:</HI> for I longed for <HI>Opportunityes</HI> of such <HI>Exercises,</HI> to which I thought the most High invited us by our precious <HI>Libertyes &amp;c.</HI> I added that my Paper was in the first place directed to <HI>G. Fox:</HI> but they suddenly catcht at my word, and <HI>John Burnet</HI> told me that <HI>G. Fox</HI> was departed before my <HI>Letters</HI> were opened,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G Fox</HI> his cun|ning <HI>Departure</HI></NOTE> and that <HI>G. Fox</HI> never saw my Paper (and probably as afterward in the dispute he spake honestlie not know|ing the Mistery) <HI>John Stubs</HI> added that my Paper gave liberty to <HI>G. Fox</HI> or his friends. I said therefore I would not fail (if God pleased) to meet them at the place, and by nine in the morning, on the day they had appointed.</P>
<P>They departed (after drink offered and accepted by some) but the next morning being the first of the Week I sent them word in writing, that diverse of our Neighbours were grieved that the <HI>Conference</HI> should be caried away from <HI>Providence</HI> to <HI>Newport</HI> wholly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">My care of in|gaging them to my whole <HI>Offer</HI> and of discussion, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> seven at <HI>Providence.</HI></NOTE> (as some of them had also spoken) I told them that the accepting of my <HI>Proffer</HI> necessarily included the Conference about the latter seven at <HI>Providence:</HI> I told them their <HI>Consci|ences</HI> and <HI>Credits</HI> lay on it, and therefore desired them to fix on a day for the dispute of the latter seven at <HI>Providence</HI> before their departure hence. This Paper was delivered to one of their Company in the room where they were together, but whither on purpose or (as tis possible) by mistake, they say the Paper was lost: so receiving no Answer from them, I late in the evening sent them another writing, signifiing, that I could not hold my self ingaged to meet them at <HI>Newport</HI> about the first seven, without their promise of discussing the latter seven at <HI>Provi|dence.</HI> Then they wrote to me that I had seemed willing, and that they had given notice, and the Countrey would come in, therefore they challenged me to appear and prove my malicious
<PB N="24" REF="000228_0030_0FA36C6887359C90">
and bitter charges against them, and withall promised that upon the finishing of the first seven at <HI>Newport,</HI> some of them would give me a meeting at <HI>Providence &amp;c.</HI> Upon the receipt of this, I sent them a third writing signifiing that I rested in their Pro|mise, and therefore (if God pleased) I would not fail to be with them at the time and place appointed. And God graciously as|sisted me in rowing all day with my old bones so that I got to <HI>Newport</HI> toward the <HI>Midnight</HI> before the morning appointed.</P>
<P>Then I sent them a fourth Paper (with a Copie of my first that miscaried as they said) and signified to them, that is would be convenient to agree about some <HI>Order</HI> of <HI>Transition,</HI> or passing from one position to another: as also since they were <HI>many</HI> and I but <HI>One,</HI> I presumed their Reason told them that I expected but <HI>One at once,</HI> and that if another desired to speak, the first should hold his peace;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Scruples a|bout meeting in the <HI>Quakers Meeting house at Newport.</HI></NOTE> as also I signified that some were scru|pulous of going into the <HI>Quakers Meeting-house,</HI> and therefore I desired some thoughts about it: they thought it convenient to send <HI>H. Bull</HI> to request me to goe to his house to them; I went; they urged the <HI>Capciousness</HI> and <HI>Conveniency</HI> of their house, and I told such as scrupled, that it was one thing to goe into a <HI>Jewish Synagogue,</HI> or a <HI>Popish Chappell</HI> to worship, or countenance, their <HI>Worships:</HI> another thing to <HI>Profess</HI> and <HI>Contest</HI> against them, in which respect <HI>Paul</HI> disputed many dayes in the <HI>Jewes Synagogues</HI> against them, and I could freelie goe into the <HI>Popes Chappel,</HI> to dispute against the <HI>Pope</HI> and his <HI>Worship.</HI></P>
<P>I knew our aged <HI>Governour Mr. Nich. Easton</HI> &amp; other<NOTE PLACE="marg">the way to conquer.</NOTE> <HI>Magistrates</HI> (of their judgment) would be there, &amp; so the <HI>Civill Peace</HI> maintained, &amp; I had a strange <HI>assurance</HI> given in to my <HI>spi|rit</HI> from God in answer to my poor requests <HI>&amp;c.</HI><ABBR><HI>viz,</HI></ABBR> that by <HI>Moderation</HI> and <HI>Patience</HI> I should conquer their <HI>Immoderations,</HI> and <HI>impatiencies,</HI> I therefore thought it in vain to spend time a|bout a <HI>Moderatour:</HI> Tis true they gave me no Answer either by Speech, or writing concerning their coming on me one at once, but to their seeming great advantage they constantly fell on me <HI>all at once,</HI> and one of them <HI>William Edmundson,</HI> with grievous Language and insulting.</P>
<P>When I came into the place aforesaid I found three able and noted preachers amongst them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Persons Disputing with me.</NOTE> <ABBR><HI>viz</HI></ABBR> <HI>John Stubs, John Burnet, William Edmunson</HI> sitting together on an high Bench with some of the <HI>Magistrates</HI> of their Judgment with them: I had heard

that <HI>John Stubs</HI> was learned in the <HI>Hebeew</HI> and the <HI>Greek</HI> (and I found him so) as for <HI>John Burnet</HI> I found him to be of a mode|rate <HI>Spirit,</HI> and a very able Speaker. The third <HI>W.

<P>I took my Seat at the other end of the house opposite to them, and began telling them that the <HI>most High</HI> was my witness,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The beginning of the <HI>Dispute.</HI></NOTE> that not our of any prejudice against, or disrespect to the persons of the <HI>Quakers</HI> (many of whome I knew and did love and honour) nor any foolish Passion of pride or boldness (for I desired to be sensible of my many decayes of <HI>my house of Clay,</HI> and other waye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">) nor any earthly or <HI>worldly ends</HI> I had that occasioned this trouble to my self and them.</P>
<P>I was first commanded this work from <HI>Heaven:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Occasion of it.</NOTE> Why should not this Argument be good for mee and for others as well as the <HI>Quakers?</HI> they say their commands are immediate (for <HI>Interpre|tations are immediate</HI>) but I say they herein suffer <HI>Satan</HI> to cheat them, for they say they pray, they fast, they wait, they listen, they judge of the motions that arise within them, and so have I done. The great maker and searcher of all hearts knowes, that none but his holy <HI>Majesty</HI> was privy to the <HI>Conception</HI> of this business.</P>
<P N="1">1. My end was, the vindicating his <HI>most holy Name,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">My ends.</NOTE> which my Soul saw was trodden in the dirt by <HI>Sathan</HI> clothed with <HI>Samuels Mantle,</HI> and the bright garment of an <HI>Angel of Light,</HI> which once he was, but pride deceived him.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="26" REF="000228_0032_0FA36C6A06E9AB28">
2. I had in mine eye the vindicating this <HI>Colony</HI> for receiving of such persons whome others would not, we suffer for their sakes, and are accounted their <HI>Abbettors:</HI> that therefore toge|ther with the improvement of our <HI>Liberty's</HI> which the <HI>God of Heaven,</HI> and our <HI>Kings Majesty</HI> have graciously given us, I might give a publick testimony against their <HI>Opinions</HI> in such a way and <HI>Exercise,</HI> I judged it incumbent upon my <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>Conscience</HI> to doe it (in some regards) more then most in the <HI>Colony.</HI> I may also truly say that.</P>
<P N="3">3. I had also in mine eye, that this exercise might occasion some <HI>Soul Consideration</HI> in many. I told them that we had a dolefull <HI>Alarum</HI> and instruction lately,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Nicholas Davis</HI> drowned at <HI>Newport</HI> a little before the <HI>Dispute.</HI></NOTE> we were taught what <HI>Salvation</HI> and <HI>saving</HI> was, in the late death and drowning of a per|son so known to us (and all <HI>N.

<P>Some of these blessed ends it hath pleased God to propagate by this occasion all this <HI>Colony</HI> over, and all of us round about have put forth our selves in <HI>Disquisitions</HI> and Searchings after the true grounds of the <HI>Christian Religion</HI> and <HI>Worship.</HI></P>
<P>I had many thoughts of beginning such an exercise with <HI>Prayer</HI> unto God for his Presence:<NOTE PLACE="marg">What Prayer was used.</NOTE> but I knew I could not joyn with them nor would they owne my <HI>Prayers:</HI> I had thoughts (as <HI>Eli|ah</HI> among the <HI>Baalites</HI>) to have prayed in the singular number: But some <HI>Considerations</HI> made my spirit content with this kind of Petition unto God: For not only in my <HI>Closet</HI> and my heart, but publickly before them all I said, <HI>I doe humbly hope and beg of</HI> God <HI>the</HI> Father <HI>of Spirits so to order and direct our Spirits in these our Agitations, that his holy name may receive glory, and the</HI> Soules <HI>of all of us some</HI> Soul-profit <HI>and Advantage.</HI></P>
<P>I began with the first Position, which I think <HI>W. Edmunson</HI> also read out of the Paper. <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>

<P>Some of these Particulars I could not then express, but think
<PB N="28" REF="000228_0034_0FA36C6B88CF14C8">
fit here to remember the former dayes, for Information of such as doe desire it.</P>
<P>These People came from <HI>Lancashire</HI> and other northern parts to the Southward of <HI>England</HI> and to <HI>London.</HI> I spake with some of their Chief then in <HI>London;</HI> I knew it was the old proud <HI>spirit</HI> which had appeared in so many soul lyes in their former decei|ved and deceiving <HI>Leaders,</HI> and I was the more confirmed in my thoughts when I saw their soul <HI>spirit</HI> so transport them, not only in lying <HI>Doctrines,</HI> but lying <HI>Quakings</HI> and <HI>Trembling,</HI> lying preaching through the Streets <HI>Repent, Repent:</HI> and lying and ab|ominable <HI>Nakedness</HI> of men and women, untill their ugly Child and Daughter <HI>Rantisme</HI> rose from their Bowels and practised <HI>Na|kedness</HI> of men and women in the Streets and in their religious <HI>Meetings,</HI> as <HI>Adamites:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Ranters <HI>are but the</HI> Qua|kers <HI>Daughter.</HI></NOTE> when it is notoriously known they fell into many <HI>uncleannesses</HI> and <HI>Aaulteryes.</HI> To my face and to the world in print they maintaind, there were no sins in them: Saying <HI>That the Saints could not sin, and God did all and was all,</HI> and they were <HI>as pure as Adam and God himself,</HI> this is known by their Writings extant <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Again I said unto my <HI>Antagonists</HI> that the manner of these <HI>quakings</HI> and <HI>shakings</HI> were not as of those <HI>quakings</HI> and trem|blings of <HI>David, Moses,</HI> and the <HI>Corinths</HI> receiving <HI>Titus</HI> with Trembling,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>True Quaking</HI></NOTE> or the working out Salvation with <HI>Fear</HI> and <HI>Trem|bling:</HI> for that may many wayes be proved to be the <HI>Soul</HI> and <HI>Spirit,</HI> out of a holy Aw and <HI>D</HI>read of the <HI>Majesty</HI> of Heaven with whome we have to deal, who only can pitty and help us in our deplorable and forlorn conditions: Hee it is who worketh the <HI>Will</HI> and the <HI>Deed,</HI> and therefore with deep impressions of <HI>Aw</HI> and <HI>Dread</HI> we ought to attend upon all his holy meanes ap|pointed, wherein (as of old in the Tabernacle and Temple) he hath promised to come to us.

<P>But the quaking and shaking motions of the <HI>Quakers</HI> (as I shall prove) they proceeded not from those holie Affections

proper to Gods Children,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The horrid</HI> shaking <HI>of the</HI> Quakers.</NOTE> so also they were horrid and mon|strous casting their bodies into horrid and monstrous motions and Gestures which mine eyes have seen: Besides the abundance of notorious Instances, what strange horrid motions are those which <HI>Theera John</HI> (as he madly calls himself) and <HI>John Toldervy</HI> were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ost and tumbled up and down with? which cannot be im|agined to proceed from the holy <HI>Spirit of God,</HI> but from Sathan to delude and cheat poor sinners with.</P>
<P>To this purpose I told them that at the first coming of this spirit to <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Westminster,</HI> some <HI>Parliament men</HI> told me that themselves went to one of the <HI>Quakers</HI> Meetings about <HI>Charing Cross,</HI> but were so affrighted with the <HI>shaking</HI> of their own bodies, and of their <HI>Chairs</HI> and Stooles under them, that they could never again be got into their <HI>Assemblyes.</HI></P>
<P>I added, that such <HI>Shakings, Motions, Extasies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Satans Coun|terfeit moti|ons.</NOTE> &amp;c.</HI> were known to be the frequent workings of <HI>Sathan</HI> upon his Servants in all ages, Such were the furious motions of <HI>Baals Preists,</HI> the motions of the <HI>Possessed</HI> mentioned in the <HI>Gospells,</HI> and other <HI>Historyes,</HI> and known to be amongst the <HI>Barbarians,</HI> our Neigh|bours about this time. <HI>John Burnet</HI> and <HI>William Edmunson</HI> rose up and said that I had laid many deep and heavy <HI>Charges</HI> upon the people of the Lord,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Quakers Answer.</HI></NOTE> which I should be never able to prove: I had denied them to be <HI>Christians,</HI> and so had wronged the good Spirit of God in them, and their Profession of worshipping God in the Spirit: Yea I had taken away their being (as men) out of the World, as a dangerous People to <HI>Nations</HI> and <HI>Kingdomes</HI> &amp; <HI>Common-weales,</HI> yea to <HI>Kings</HI> &amp; <HI>Princes,</HI> and so not fit to live a|mongst men in the World. These Speeches were often uttered and enlarged by one or other of them, and that with Zeal (and Passion in <HI>W. Edmunson</HI>)</P>
<P>I waited patiently till these <HI>Gusts</HI> of their angry Spirit was over, and then I told them I had not wronged them in a title: But by the help of the most High I would make all good against them, &amp; toen leave it to every mans and womans Soul to judge at their own Perill.</P>
<P>About this time <HI>John Stubs</HI> alleadged that of <HI>Paul;</HI> Phil 2. <HI>Work out salvation with fear and Trembling.</HI></P>
<P>I replyed in no way opposed the awfull and most serious im|pressions of <HI>Gods Majesty</HI> in all his appearances &amp; ordinances upon the Soules and Spirits,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quaking and Trembling.</HI></NOTE> yea and <HI>Bodyes</HI> of Gods Children.
<PB N="30" REF="000228_0036_0FA36C6D0922CE60">
But I denied that those places to the <HI>Corinthians</HI> and <HI>Philippians</HI> concerned any such bodily shakings and quakings as we now de|bated.</P>
<P>Beside I said if <HI>Quaking</HI> and <HI>Trembling</HI> were a Command and an Ordinance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No Ordinance of God</NOTE> and institution of God to be practised, then was in constantly to be practised (as the <HI>Jewes</HI> say of <HI>Cain</HI> that the Mark which God set upon him was a constant <HI>Trembling</HI>) O if not alwayes, yet alwayes in <HI>Worship,</HI> or if not alwayes in <HI>worship</HI> yet at some certain times.

<P>I also declared, that the <HI>most High</HI> and holy one, was free as he pleased to cause the trembling of the <HI>Soules</HI> of his People to over flow with influence upon their <HI>Bodyes</HI> also, asin <HI>Moses, David, Daniel, Habakkuk, Paul, &amp;c.</HI> this is like to be in some extraordinary cases and <HI>Conversions</HI> or turnings to God, as <HI>Paul'</HI>s was, and that especially in bringing of <HI>great Sinners</HI> or <HI>old Sinners</HI> unto himself <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>There were some few Speeches, some from the <HI>Governour</HI> and his Wife, and some few others that spake, some in favour of, and some against the <HI>Quakers,</HI> but neither did my Opposites nor I so far attend them as to engage with them, excepting some Turnes that were between <HI>William Edmunson,</HI> and <HI>William Hitchcock</HI> (an Inhabitant of <HI>Newport</HI>) who (as others did) witnessed against their upbraiding me with my age (<HI>Old man, Old man &amp;c.</HI>) as also for their <HI>Interruptions.</HI></P>
<P>Mine own Brother Mr <HI>Robert Williams,</HI> School-Master in <HI>Newport,</HI> desired to speak: nor he nor others dissenting from them could be permitted, except they would set their hands to my Paper.

But I answered that I was <HI>alone</HI> in the Bu|siness, I had not consulted with any others but the God of heaven himself: so that I denied vehemently that there was any such agreement,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The unequall Termes of the <HI>Quakers</HI> en|joyning <HI>Sub|scription.</HI></NOTE> or any colour for it. Besides it was ridiculous to put either such a <HI>Bar</HI> and Limit upon any mans spirit, and least of all upon Gods <HI>Spirit,</HI> <ABBR><HI>viz,</HI></ABBR> that no man should desire leave to object or querie <HI>&amp;c.</HI> except first he would subscribe my <HI>Pro|posalls.</HI> But I took the boldness justly to charg them with pal|pable and gross <HI>Partiality</HI><ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that <HI>W.

<P>However, there were these few debates about the liberty of speech in the Auditory and By-standers, and the <HI>Quakers</HI> deniall and enjoining of <HI>Subscription:</HI> yet the most High, <HI>Father of Spirits</HI> did so compose all spirits, that it was wonderfull that such <HI>Opposites</HI> should goe through such a work and Conflict all day untill night, without more <HI>Interruptions</HI> and <HI>Disturbances.</HI></P>
<P>I was ready and waited to put forth my third Reason to prove they were not true Christian Quakers, it was from Isai. 66. <HI>To this man will I look that is poor and contrite, and trembleth at my</HI> Word.

<P>Whether I spake all these Particulars at one individuall time or Turn I cannot clearly remember, only I am certain thus I spake and more.</P>

<P><HI>Again,</HI> in the some Page <HI>G.

<P>Now diverse observing the publickly expressing how unsuitable it was that three of the ablest <HI>Speakers</HI> amongst them should <HI>Con|sult</HI> openly and <HI>whisper</HI> and utter themselves one immediate|ly after each other, and sometimes <HI>all together</HI> as one man against me: <HI>W. Edmondson</HI> answered and excused it saying, that it was mine own <HI>Paper</HI> (which he often produced) which exprest my Offer to make good my <HI>Position;</HI> against, all <HI>Comers;</HI> But I replyed (once and again) That as God is a God of <HI>Order,</HI> and doth all things in <HI>Number, Weight</HI> and <HI>Measure,</HI> in Most admira|ble <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Method,</HI> so I had thought that (according as I writ and spake to them) they would have had so much <HI>Ingenuity</HI> to conceive, that nor I nor any man was so simple as to offer to Dispute with, to oppose and to answer twenty or thirty or one hundred at once: But thus like subtle and impudent <HI>Foxes</HI> and <HI>Jesuites</HI> they pleaded and practised from the beginning of the <HI>Conference</HI> unto the end of the 4<HI>th</HI> day,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Tis had to hold the Foxi|ans or any Quil|ty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to a fair Dispute.</HI></NOTE> resolving to make use of and (like dying men by drowning) to catch at any ridiculous <HI>Ad|vantage</HI> though <HI>unchristian</HI> and <HI>uncivill.</HI></P>
<P>But the truth is, this and many other <HI>Dicouragements</HI> and <HI>Dis|advantages</HI> and <HI>Difficultyes</HI> the <HI>Lord Jesus</HI> graciously and faithfully

(For his name sake) enabled me to cut through, otherwise I saw the <HI>Debate</HI> would not have held on so many <HI>Hours</HI> as it did <HI>Dayes,</HI> I knew they had as much mind to this work (no nor any guilty <HI>Soul</HI> in the world) as <HI>Bears</HI> to be tyed to a stake to be baited: and I must humbly declared and predicate it (to the praise of the <HI>Father of mercyes,</HI> and for the incouragement of others to be <HI>Patient</HI> for <HI>Christ Jesus</HI> sake) that an hand from heaven caried me through to the end of each day, and to the end of the whole business.</P>
<P>Sometimes I offered to proceed to another <HI>Point,</HI> but all this first day was spent upon the first <HI>Point</HI> of <HI>true</HI> and <HI>false Quakers:</HI> For though many upon a sudden spake as <HI>Mr. Coddington Mr. Easton</HI> (then Governour, who spake sharply) <HI>William Dyer, William Harris</HI> and others against me, yet I minded closely what my <HI>Antagonists</HI> vented, who were placed on high in their <HI>Desk</HI> against me: <HI>John Stubs</HI> and <HI>John Burnet</HI> were more sober and manly, but <HI>W. Edmundson</HI> (who was the junior of three) would speak all like <HI>Solomons</HI> foolish woman, <HI>loud</HI> and <HI>clamorous, simple</HI> and <HI>knowing nothing,</HI> being in truth nothing but a <HI>flash</HI> of wit, a <HI>Face of Brass,</HI> and a <HI>Tongue</HI> set on <HI>fire</HI> from the <HI>Hell of Lyes and Fury.</HI></P>
<P>One <HI>Instance</HI> here fell out, for when I urged that it was not what man had <HI>within him</HI> already, and brought into the world with him, that made a true <HI>Quaker,</HI> but the <HI>Spirit of God</HI> accom|panying and blessing the <HI>Reading</HI> and <HI>Hearing</HI> of the <HI>writings</HI> of <HI>God preached and opened:</HI> I said the <HI>Heart</HI> of man was shut up lockt and ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">'d up in <HI>willing Ignorance</HI> and <HI>darkness</HI> untill the <HI>finger of God</HI> in the use of those and other blessed meanes, <HI>pick</HI> open in a more gentle way, or <HI>break</HI> open by great afflictions and and <HI>terrours</HI> the <HI>Soul</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> of man. I said that <HI>Paul</HI> preached the <HI>word</HI> by the River side, but the Lord opened the heart of <HI>Lydia:</HI> and while I was saying that, <HI>It was not Paul nor Pauls Preaching nor the word that he preached&mdash;</HI> at this word <HI>W. Ed|mondson</HI> clamour'd out, <HI>He speakes Blasphemy:</HI> But it pleased God to move the heart of our <HI>Deputy-Governour</HI> Capt. <HI>Cranston</HI> justly and seasonably to witness against this <HI>Interruption</HI> saying,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>W.

Edmnndson</HI> is offended as thinking I spoke a|gainst the <HI>word Christ;</HI> but <HI>Christ Jesus</HI> knowes that I had no such thought, but of the words which <HI>Paul</HI> spake. And I added that it was not <HI>Lydia</HI> nor all her <HI>Light</HI> within her, nor <HI>Paul</HI> nor
<PB N="38" REF="000228_0044_0FA36C730B284ED8">
his <HI>Preaching,</HI> nor the <HI>word</HI> nor <HI>words</HI> that he uttered, but the Finger of <HI>Gods Spirit</HI> (according to <HI>Election</HI>) that set the <HI>word</HI> or <HI>words</HI> of <HI>Paul</HI> home, opening her <HI>heart</HI> and not every heart, (shewing what free grace is against the <HI>Popish</HI> and <HI>Arminian</HI> and <HI>Foxians</HI> exalting of <HI>Cursed Nature</HI>) and then it was that she being by the Lord turned, she turned to attend &amp; apply to her soul the words which were spoken by <HI>Paul,</HI> as a poor <HI>Rams-horn</HI> made use of in the hand of <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P>Toward the end of the day <HI>W. Edmondson</HI> fell into a long <HI>Invective,</HI> how I had falsly standered the <HI>People of God,</HI> not on|ly in this place,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Forians boast of their Number.</HI></NOTE> but the whole Body of the People of the <HI>Lord</HI> called <HI>Quakers</HI> in all parts: For said he we are a great people, many thousands in <HI>England,</HI> many thousands in <HI>London,</HI> besides in <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Barbadoes</HI> and other places, and <HI>N-England.</HI> And he and they said, hast thou any more to say to make out thy <HI>Lyes</HI> against them.</P>
<P>I Answered (as at other times) that the <HI>Papists</HI> the common <HI>Protestants,</HI> the <HI>Jews</HI> and the <HI>Mahumitans</HI> and <HI>Pagans</HI> &amp;c. fir|ed the world with their <HI>Numbers,</HI> and yet we jointly opposed them in <HI>Religious matters</HI> notwithstanding their <HI>innumerable num|bers:</HI> And as for more proof that they were not <HI>True Quakers,</HI> and so truly <HI>Fearing and Trembling</HI> before <HI>God,</HI> I told them I would produce an Argument, that they were so far from being <HI>Christians,</HI> that they were a to be <HI>exploded</HI> and <HI>abhorred</HI> of all <HI>Mankind,</HI> as being fallen beneath the common <HI>temper</HI> and <HI>na|ture</HI> of the <HI>Humanity</HI> of men and women, yea of the Savage and <HI>Barbarous</HI> in the world, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> their stripping <HI>stark naked</HI> their <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Women</HI> and <HI>Maidens</HI> and pasting along in publick places and <HI>Streets</HI> unto the <HI>Assemblyes</HI> of <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Youths</HI> and so were beheld and gazed upon by them! and this under a pretence of being stir|red up by God as a <HI>Service</HI> or <HI>Worship</HI> unto God, as an act of <HI>Christian Religion</HI> proceeding from the immediate moving of the most holy <HI>Spirit of God,</HI> most glorious in purity, and purity and holiness it self.</P>
<P>At first <HI>W. Edmundson</HI> seemed to make strange of the matter as if it could not be proved that any of their women should so appear in the <HI>Assemblyes</HI> of People.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Two of the Fox|ian women na|ked in</HI> New-England.</NOTE> I told them the matter of <HI>fact</HI> was so <HI>notorious</HI> that it would be loss of time and <HI>Impudence</HI> to question it, being so fouly and openly <HI>practised</HI> both in <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="000228_0045_0FA36C73C796F288">
Also I added further, that <HI>G. Bishop</HI> of <HI>Bristow,</HI> one of them|selves, in his second part of the <HI>Persecutions of New-England,</HI> re|lates in print the names of two women in <HI>N-England</HI> that did so practice: and he complains of <HI>N-England Persecution</HI> because those women suffered <HI>Whipping</HI> for those actions by the <HI>Courts</HI> and <HI>Officers</HI> of <HI>N-England.</HI></P>
<P><HI>John Burnet</HI> said that the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> were a People known to abhor all <HI>Impurity</HI> and Uncleanness and the <HI>Appearance</HI> of it, and if any of their women should so practice, they should condemn it in them, yet nevertheless if it should please the <HI>Lord God</HI> to stir up any of his <HI>Daughters</HI> so to appear as a <HI>Sign</HI> and <HI>Testimony</HI> against the <HI>Nakedness</HI> of others, they durst not con|demn it.</P>
<P><HI>John Stubs</HI> said, that they did condemn all immodest <HI>Appearan|ces</HI> in women, both in <HI>Behaviour</HI> and <HI>Gestures.</HI> But if God stirred them up and commanded them to this service to discover the <HI>Na|kedness</HI> of others, they could not but acknowledge <HI>Gods</HI> hand, and submit to it: And he further added, that it was a great <HI>Cross</HI> to a sober womans spirit so to act, as well as an affliction and suffer|ing to her body.</P>
<P><HI>John Stubs</HI> likewise alleadged the <HI>Prophet Isaiah,</HI> (as also did <HI>W. E.</HI>) and the <HI>Sign</HI> of the Prophet <HI>Ezekiel:</HI> and <HI>John Stubs</HI> read the 20<HI>th</HI> of <HI>Isa.</HI> where <HI>Isaiah</HI> was commanded to goe <HI>naked</HI> for a <HI>Sign</HI> to the <HI>Egyptians</HI> and <HI>Ethyopians,</HI> to prophesie and de|nounce that they also should go naked with their buttocks un|covered as the words are: and this is (said they) a proof that the People of the Lord might be stirred up by <HI>God</HI> to such actions for <HI>Signs</HI> unto others.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Isai. 20. <HI>discus|sed touching</HI> Nakedness.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>I Answered,</HI> That this was in the dayes of <HI>Figures</HI> and <HI>Signs,</HI> Shadows and <HI>Ceremonyes:</HI> And though this was <HI>G. Fox</HI> his Answer (in his Book which I had there by me) yet <HI>G. Fox</HI> through|out all this his Book in <HI>Folio,</HI> turns of the Allegations and Argu|ments of many of his <HI>Opposites</HI> with this Answer, <HI>to wit, The</HI> Substances <HI>is come, the</HI> Body <HI>is come,</HI> Christ <HI>the</HI> End <HI>of the</HI> Law, <HI>the</HI> End <HI>of the</HI> Command, <HI>the</HI> End <HI>of the</HI> Scriptures, <HI>the</HI> End <HI>of the</HI> Prophets, <HI>and of all</HI> Signs <HI>and</HI> Shadows <HI>and</HI> Figures.</P>
<P N="2">2. Although it were so threatned that the <HI>Ethiopians</HI> and <HI>Egyptians</HI> should so goe <HI>totally</HI> and <HI>stark Naked,</HI> and that <HI>Isaiah</HI> did so, which is much questioned: yet it is not to be questioned but that the <HI>Egyptians</HI> and <HI>Ethiopians</HI> in their flight, would cover
<PB N="40" REF="000228_0046_0FA36C748797B1F0">
their <HI>Secret parts</HI> with the first cloaths or raggs they could get, as it is no question but the Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> did.</P>
<P N="3">3. The difference of <HI>Nakedness</HI> of <HI>Mankind</HI> and <HI>Womankind</HI> is very great in all <HI>Nations.</HI> The <HI>Sex</HI> of <HI>Women</HI> is more fitted and framed by God for a <HI>Covering,</HI> for <HI>Retiredness</HI> and keeping at home and for <HI>Modesty</HI> and <HI>Bashfulness;</HI> nor do we ever read, that ever God commanded such a thing to Women, or that ever it came into his heart, or that ever any <HI>Godly Woman</HI> did so prac|tice: there is no shadow or colour of <HI>Proof</HI> from the holy <HI>Scrip|ture,</HI> nor from any <HI>Civill</HI> and sober People, no nor from the naked <HI>Barbarians</HI> themselves, who though they suffer their <HI>Male Children</HI> to go naked till about seven years old, yet cover they their <HI>Females</HI> from their birth: Tis true it is said in <HI>Brasil</HI> and other bruitish places some <HI>Savage bruits</HI> go so, but they are <HI>Cani|bals, Men-eaters &amp;c.</HI> and other B<HI>arbarians</HI> do not so except in <HI>Drunkenness</HI> and <HI>Madness.</HI></P>
<P>They still answered, that they would not <HI>Countenance</HI> any such <HI>Practice</HI> but if the <HI>Lord God</HI> so commanded his <HI>Sons</HI> and <HI>Daughters</HI> it must be obeyed.</P>
<P>I demanded of them how it should be known that it was the voice and command of <HI>God,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The true voice of God, and ma|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y false and retended.</HI></NOTE> the <HI>God</HI> of <HI>Holiness,</HI> and not the command of the unclean <HI>spirit?</HI> for I told them under that Cover that one of them might be so commanded, and sent of God in such a posture and behaviour amongst men, why might not ten or twenty, yea all the women in this present. <HI>Assembly</HI> be so stirred up as it were by the <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>God</HI> to the horror and amazement of the whole <HI>Countrey</HI> yea of the whole <HI>World?</HI></P>
<P>They seemed to me to be <HI>Confounded</HI> with this Argument and weary to hear of it, and not willing to speak to it: I therefore took occasion my self to say that it was true in former Dispensa|tions. The Command of God came to <HI>Abraham</HI> to kill his own Child, his son <HI>Isaac,</HI> and this fact enjoined him did seem as hor|rible <HI>unnatural</HI> and <HI>cruel,</HI> as this <HI>Nakedness</HI> of the Women unwo|manly and <HI>unnatural.</HI> But,</P>
<P N="1">1. It was in the day and dispensation of such wonderfull <HI>Signs</HI> and figurative teachings unto men.</P>
<P>And 2. I said <HI>God</HI> did furnish them with a Spirit of discerning the <HI>true</HI> dream from the false,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Immediate In|spirations and Revelations.</HI></NOTE> the true voice from the false, the voice of <HI>God</HI> from the voice of <HI>Sathan:</HI> But in our day wherein God had altered his Dispensations and Revelations which he

used to the <HI>Fathers,</HI> and had spoken to us by his <HI>Son,</HI> and had left his mind both in the <HI>old</HI> and <HI>new Scriptures</HI> or Writings: We have the example and President of the <HI>Lord Jesus,</HI> that is, to attend to the holy <HI>Scriptures</HI> only, and to use the weapon of [<HI>It is writ|ten it is written</HI>] against <HI>Satkans</HI> immediate <HI>Inspirations</HI> and temp|tations.</P>
<P>Here <HI>W. Edmondson</HI> fel into a great heat against me and said that I spoke <HI>Blasphemy,</HI> in saying that <HI>Abraham</HI> and the <HI>Saints</HI> then! had a way and Spirit of discerning the Spirits which we had not, implying that Gods Spirit was not the same: He added, that I had kept them long and had proved nothing, and yet we had not done with the first <HI>Position.</HI> I replyed, that I had produced such <HI>Grounds</HI> as should never be shaken, and that I presumed did ap|pear to the <HI>Consciences</HI> of many, and I heartily desired might also appear unto their Spirits, Soules, and <HI>Consciences.</HI> Some of the Auditors spake to this Purpose, especially <HI>W. Hitchcocks</HI> who in|sulted upon the <HI>Water Baptisms.</HI></P>
<P>And thus by Gods <HI>Mercy</HI> and Patience the Discourse of the first day ended: which very day was notable and <HI>significant</HI> as to the created <HI>Sun</HI> in the Heavens,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Eclipse of the Sun in the midst of the first dayes Disputa|tion.</HI></NOTE> who in the midst of our Contest was <HI>eclipsed,</HI> and hid his Face remarkably, and preached aloud to us, that although the true <HI>Lord Jesus Christ</HI> the <HI>Sun</HI> of Righte|ousness, do suffer (in his infinite wisdom and and Patience) false <HI>Christs</HI> and false <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Herod</HI> and <HI>Pontius Pilate,</HI> and his e|nemies of all sorts, <HI>Jewes</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> to cloud his <HI>Face</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> a little from the World and his own People, yet he will break forth again in his eternal brightness, splendor and glory.</P>
<P>When that heavenly young <HI>Martyr</HI> or Witness of <HI>Jesus Christ William Hunter</HI> was burnt at <HI>Burnt-wood</HI> in <HI>Essex</HI> it was a close and gloomy day,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A note of W.</HI> Hunter <HI>burnt in</HI> Essex at Burnt wood.</NOTE> but this gallant young Champion of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> crying out aloud at the stake, <HI>Son of God look on me, Son of God shine upon me!</HI> immediately that most wonderfull <HI>Light &amp; Fire</HI> of Hea|ven the <HI>Sun</HI> tore the clouds and brake forth and shined gloriously and remarkably upon the face of this blessed <HI>Witness</HI> at the suffer|ing of the flames of fire, son <HI>Jesus</HI> his truth sake against the <HI>who|rish Principles</HI> of both the <HI>Papists &amp; Quakers:</HI> and thus do the holy writings tel us, that this most glorious light <HI>the Sun of Righ|teousness,</HI> visibly appeared in his glorious and glorified Form and Shape to the visible eye of his servant <HI>Steven</HI> while he patiently suf|fered for the true <HI>Lord Jesus</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the murthering Stones to lay him down to sleep.</P>

It comes to my mind that in reading &amp; urging some of these Passa|ges concerning these <HI>Foxians</HI> denying the <HI>Humane Nature</HI> and <HI>Person</HI> of the <HI>Lord Jesus,</HI> one of my Opposites <HI>John Stubs</HI> insisted upon that 9. of <HI>Isaiah</HI> where Christ is called the <HI>Everlasting Fa|ther:</HI> and yet he said, <HI>He was the Son of Man, born of a Woman,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Everlasting Father Christ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &amp; how</HI></NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I Answered, the <HI>Hebrew</HI> word rendred by our <HI>Translators,</HI> the <HI>Everlasting Father</HI> is Translated by some, the <HI>Father of an age,</HI> or <HI>the Father of Ages,</HI> alluding to the great increase and spreading of Christs Name, and the mighty increase of his Spiritual Seed (as the Lord promised to <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Isaac</HI>) as the Stars of Heaven. <HI>John Stubs</HI> said the <HI>Hebrew word</HI> was [<HI>Abi Haad,</HI> &amp;c.] and it was rendred <HI>Pater Eternitatis:</HI> I replied that it was rendred (and that more near the <HI>Hebrew</HI>) <HI>Pater seculi,</HI> or <HI>seculorum:</HI> But I told him it was not a seasonable time and place for him and me to spend much time about the Translation of the word: he said he had brought the <HI>Hebrew Bible</HI> with him,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Quakers wonderfull, changed &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> but in Dissimu|lation as to learning &amp; the Scriptures</HI></NOTE> and it may be he understood the <HI>Hebrew</HI> and the <HI>Greek</HI> and other Languages as well as my self and better too: I was about to say that they were wonderfully al|tered and changed from their former principles and practises, for heretofore they have professed to me that they had no need of Books, no not of the Scripture it self, for they had the Teacher within them, that gave forth Scripture, &amp;c. if now they were per|swaded to study the Holy Scripture, and the Translation of it, and to examine the Translations and the Copies of them, then they did err and sin before, (which they say the Saints cannot) in so wonderfully neglecting and slighting them as useless and needless things.</P>
<P>Yea the truth is if their Light be so Alsufficient as they make it, to bring them to Heaven, to guide them immediately and infallibly &amp;c. what simplicity is it in them to stoop to <HI>Pen and Ink,</HI> and mens fallible Translations, yea, many wayes charged with many failings.</P>
<P>I know their Pretences of becoming <HI>All to All</HI> to win the more, and of removing the offence and stumbling block, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> as if they denied the Scriptures, but the truth is, they look at the <HI>Holy Scri|ptures</HI> still but as the <HI>Ceremonies</HI> which the <HI>Apostles</HI> dispensed with for a season: they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">re no more for the Scriptures then the <HI>Pa|pists</HI> do, they are forced to make use of them for an end, but all their hopers in their <HI>Interpretations,</HI> which both <HI>Papists and Qua|kers</HI>

<P N="2">2. The second part of his Sermon was (as usually it is of all their Sermons) an extolling and magnifying of that Light which

<P>I had thought then to have spoke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">John Stubs <HI>his Sermon</HI></NOTE> but immediately <HI>Jo.

<P>I further said, that I had more to offer in the name and in the cause of the true Lord Jesus Christ, and after I had got liberty of speech, I said that as they which <HI>denied</HI> the person of the true Lord Jesus denied the true <HI>Lord Jesus</HI> himself,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Offices of Christ Jesus</HI></NOTE> so they which denied the Offices which God the Father had invested him with and <HI>designed him</HI> to fulfil, they <HI>denied</HI> the true <HI>Lord Jesus Christ.</HI></P>

<P>I said I would contract my thoughts,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Kingly office of the Lord Je|sus.</HI></NOTE> and speak at present only a little of his <HI>Kingly power</HI> and <HI>Office,</HI> and I plainly denounced that they were all notoriously guilty of <HI>High Treason</HI> against the King of Kings, the Lord Jesus, yea as far as in them lay, they robd him of his Crown, and Life, and All.</P>

<P>Upon this (as I remember) there fell out some words between my Opposites, and some of the people called <HI>Baptists:</HI> But some of them (especially <HI>John Stubs</HI>) demanded of me, why I thus charged them and was my self so guilty, not living in <HI>Church Or|dinances</HI> myself.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Touching the se|verall Churches extant.</HI></NOTE></P>

<P>But <HI>Thirdly.</HI> Not finding rest, they themselves knew, there is a <HI>Time</HI> of purity and <HI>Primitive Sincerity:</HI> there is a time of <HI>Trans|gression &amp; Apostacy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The various ap|pearances of Christ Jesus</HI></NOTE> there is a time of the coming out of the <HI>Babilonian Apostacy &amp; Wilderness:</HI> there is a time of many <HI>Flocks</HI> pretending to be Christs and saying, <HI>Loe here he is &amp;c.</HI> and a Command of Christ Jesus, goe not into the <HI>Wilderness,</HI> goe not into the private <HI>Chambers:</HI> There is a time when <HI>Christ Jesus</HI> his Doves and Loves cry out to him, <HI>O thou whome my Soul loveth, tell me where thou feedest, where thou makest thy Flock to rest at noon; for why should I be as one that turns aside to the Flocks of my Compani|ons?</HI> I doe not remember that any <HI>Reply</HI> was made to this by any of my <HI>Opposites,</HI> nor heard I any more of this <HI>Objection.</HI></P>
<P>I now praied there patience to hear me a few words: I said we had spent two whole dayes from morning to night and had pro|ceeded no further then the Debates of the two first <HI>Positions,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> offer in the end of the second dayes conference.</HI></NOTE> I told them if they were free I would attend them again in the Morning (being the first of the week) to fall upon the proof of my other five positions remaining for <HI>Newport:</HI> or if they were not willing to that, I would (if God permitted) attend them there on the second day called <HI>Munday,</HI> in the Morning to pro|ceed upon the rest.</P>
<P><HI>W. Edmundson</HI> said,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Lying pretenders to Gods service</HI></NOTE> they had spent so much time already upon but two of them: and both he and <HI>John Stubs</HI> said they had other business in hand then to attend unto <HI>my false Charges</HI> which in all

this time I could not make out: they said they must go about the work of the Lord to which he had called them.</P>
<P>I told them I had used all diligence, I failed not to meet them a|bout the exact hour appointed, and alwayes before the Audience was come. I never withdrew nor absented a <HI>Minute,</HI> but put my old <HI>Carcase</HI> to constant pursuit of my promise which lay on me to fulfil, and to make out my proofs, although they had spoke never a word until I had finished: I used all possible brevetie,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Authors just Apologie against the adjust <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the Quakers</HI></NOTE> and oft times suppressed my thoughts pressing in upon me for Utte|rance and Audience; I rather chose thus to Apologize for my self, then down right to blame them, on whom (they saw well enough) I said the blame of our long proceeding. I told them I had spoken nothing to them but the <HI>Eternal truth</HI> of God, which sooner or later would arrest them, and using aloud the words of the Lords Jesus [<ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR><HI>The words that I have spoken shall judge you at the last day.</HI>] I withdrew.</P>
<P>Within a quarter of an hour they sent one to me to desire my coming in again to them and <HI>William Edmondson</HI> (commonly their proud mouth) told me that I had deeply charged them and laid many <HI>false Accusations</HI> upon them, and some of them dan|gerous, both as they were <HI>Christians,</HI> and as they were men: they had used long patience in hearing of me, and yet because it should be seen that they were willing to hear the utmost that I had to say they would meet and spend a few hours with me on the second Day following at <HI>nine in the Morning,</HI> only they would not endure any long and tedious Discourses.</P>
<P>I Answered that their own souls knew,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A mutual agree|ment for a third dayes confe|rence.</HI></NOTE> and the <HI>Auditors</HI> knew I used to be brief: and if they had pleased to have given me leave, I would have finished the whole seven by noon the first day: and I would now promise them (by Gods help) to finish what I had to say to the other five remaining in a quarter of an hour, so that in five quarters of an hour I would present them with what I had to say: <HI>W. Edmundson</HI> said they would expect I should so do, and all of them seemed well pleased that I offered to dispatch each Position in a quarter of an hour; I said they must not count me false &amp; a <HI>Promise-breaker</HI> if I was not exact to a quarter of an hour possible I might be within a quarter, possible I might something exceed it, but I hoped not to exceed above a quarter.</P>
<P><HI>W. Edmundson</HI> replied, Nay <HI>Roger</HI> thou must be punctual if

thou wil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> be a Christian: and indeed afterward at <HI>Providence</HI> he unjustly more then once upbraided me saying,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A quarter of an hour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"></HI></NOTE> <HI>Is this your quar|ter of an hour?</HI> I answered that Christians, nor any prudent man would be so curious and critical as to raise Censures and Accusa|tions upon the nicityes and uncertaintyes of a few <HI>Minutes,</HI> for unless we had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> and quarter-Glasses (as in some Ships) it was impossible to be exactly punctual: however by Gods help I said I would study such <HI>Exactness,</HI> that I would rather o|mit much I had to say then fail in my promise to them.</P>
<P>After this (as I heard) <HI>W Hitchcock</HI> of <HI>Newport</HI> held dispute with them about Water-Baptisme, I was withdrawn being even|ing and weary.</P>
<P>I was told by many of <HI>Providence,</HI> that I knew them they would not stand a <HI>Disputation:</HI> or if they did they would not con|tinue without great <HI>Advantages</HI> and be as slippery as <HI>Eeles,</HI> and break off abruptly,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Quakers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &amp; policy</HI></NOTE> as their spirit hurried them, I therefore studi|ously endeavoured to tole and drive them to the finishing of my remaining five at <HI>Newport,</HI> and the other seven at <HI>Providence.</HI> And thus by the most wise and gracious hand of God we came to the end of the second dayes work, and the second Position and the end of the Week.</P>
<P>It was queried by some why (at <HI>Newport</HI> and <HI>Providence</HI> after|ward) they appointed the end of the weeks for the <HI>Disputation?</HI> and why since it was not finished they would not proceed on the first day?

<P>I knew it was in vain, (as in the other two dayes past I found it) to insist upon their obstinately continued <HI>Advantage</HI> of three con|stantly engaged against me (beside their accidental speakers who had liberty when others were forbidden) I say notable and <HI>Chief men</HI> in their way and <HI>Sect:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Letter sent into all of us.</HI></NOTE> and having just then read a Letter as I sate there directed to my self and all of us to be read in the <HI>Assembly,</HI> I begun with presenting the Letter to them, and told them that just now it was delivered to me <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I knew not certainly from whome it came, nor of one Tittle of the Contents of it: only I judged it to be my Brother <HI>Robert Williams (School-Master</HI> of <HI>Newport</HI>) his hand: I read the <HI>Superscription</HI> and of|fered if they pleased to unseal and read it, or I would deliver it into their hand so to doe.</P>
<P><HI>W.

the whole <HI>Assembly</HI> had Interest in the Letter, as directed to us to read to the rest.</P>
<P><HI>W.

<P>L<HI>Oving Friends, though the Lord in his Wisdome hath denied me from</HI> Nature <HI>the gift of utterance, yet in his infinite mercy he hath vouchsafed to me his free gift as to</HI> writing, <HI>whereby the private motions arising between God and my own Soul (without knowledge unto any) may be declared, being moved hereunto out of a sensible sadness, which is upon my Spirit in beholding the</HI> Cloudings <HI>and</HI> Vail|ings <HI>of the most precious Truths of my Lord and Master</HI> Jesus Christ: <HI>But</HI> (Loving Friends) <HI>herein mistake me not at first: This is no charge nor discharge, but an appearance unto my Soul, even unto the moving of my Bowels within me: For my</HI> Beloved <HI>at his putting in his hand at the hole of the door, when all my</HI> Lovers, Priests <HI>and</HI> Elders <HI>gave up the Ghost in the City: (for gladness) is taken away, and joy out of the pleasant field, and in the vineyard there is no (true) singing, and the</HI> Treaders <HI>tread out no (pure) Wine, for the Lord hath made the</HI> Vintage <HI>shouting to cease: But to avoid Prolixity, I write not to charge nor admonish, neither for</HI> contending Argumentation, <HI>it being against my understanding, and as the taking of a</HI> Dog <HI>by the ear: But sincerely unto edification, in signifying the appearances unto my Soul in what I have gotten from these your so earnest and tedious</HI> Debates.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="000228_0078_0FA36B88D239CD50">
<HI>Therefore I am humbly bold to speak unto all the contending</HI> Dispu|<HI>tants in the plainess of my heart.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And</HI> First <HI>unto the</HI> Complaining Disputant <HI>it appears unto my Soul that you have not dealt as a faithful Servant of the Lord Jesus, with your fellow Servants, for you should have admonished them both first and second time in private, and if they would not have heard you then to have told it to the Church, the great</HI> Congregation <HI>of God.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It doth appear unto my Soul, that you have assumed and pre|sumed too much, being so large and high proposals, which do appear unto me not as charges, but in this first Appearance as Proposals, until they are maintained as charges by sufficient proof, wherein they may be molified: But in truth herein I am at a stand, for against whom were the true</HI> Apostles <HI>more bitter then against the</HI> False? <HI>which if the</HI> De|fendants <HI>be so (which in charity I have reason to hope otherwise) your Conscience will be more cleared in your Lord and Masters service: yet know there may be a zeal without true knowledge, therefore let true zeal appear that is not in persecution, but for the Glory of God and truths sake, as it is in Jesus.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Unto the</HI> Defending Complaints <HI>(the loving</HI> Quakers) <HI>which I pray take not as a charge, but as appearances unto my Soul in that you never dealt faithfully in your Lord and Masters service, for both</HI> Complainants <HI>and</HI> Defendants <HI>are all but Servants unto one Lord and Master, and you must do that service which is ordained by you</HI> Lord and Master <HI>to do in your several stations (either in truth or falshood) there is no hindring of it, and when you have done all you can, you are but unprofitable Servants, falling short of your</HI> Lord and Masters <HI>infinite Glory, and in the end of your service, you shall as the Grasse wither, and as the Flower fade, but unto our everlasting com|forts the word of the Lord shall stand for ever.</HI></P>
<P>First, <HI>That you have not done your Master faithful service by as|suming and presuming beyond the bounds of</HI> Moderation <HI>and</HI> Christi|anity: <HI>but as I said before take not these as charges, but as proceeding from your own</HI> Expressions <HI>and</HI> Behaviours <HI>in your late actings which have not been for that solid edification of the</HI> Auditors <HI>which was expected but for defending and advancing of self, which ap|peard:</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>By your limiting the Holy one of</HI> Israel <HI>contrary unto your</HI> Lord <HI>and</HI> Masters <HI>Commission.</HI></P>

<P N="3"><PB N="73" REF="000228_0079_0FA36B8A03015920">
3. <HI>You have not dealt faithfully and Christian like with your older fellow servant, and then what would you do with the Heir.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To the first appearance you would not begin before you had stated by forced Covenant that none should speak (though with leave in mo|desty and sobriety) but those that would joyn issue with the complain|ant,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>True liberty in|fringed</HI></NOTE> and that under hand writing. And herein (loving friends) you have infringed upon those great Liberties and Mercies which God hath bestowed upon these parts, and which you do enjoy, and cannot en|joy else where: And will you now shut up your common Wine-presses that we can have no fruit nor refreshing but what comes from your private Presses? Know</HI> (Loving Friends) <HI>this is a sad grievance that lies upon us. Yea, you do infringe not only upon our Souls but upon our</HI> Temporal Liberties.</P>
<P><HI>For in our Courts of Judicature there is a fundamental liberty stated for any to speak freely for Conscience sake in any Cause in the Bounds of Sobriety and Modesty. But this appears against the Rules and Practises of all</HI> Christianity, <HI>not practised by the</HI> Judicial Convocation, <HI>nor by the high</HI> Commission Court <HI>in our Native Country, where often I have been and the</HI> Metropolitan <HI>with the rest of the</HI> Bishops <HI>in Gravity and Christianity (though their pleadings were by Proctors, yet) gave liberty especially for Relations to speak: As in one Instance of a person whom you all have heard of, when he was to come upon Examination, his Wife being big with Childe came with him, the</HI> Arch-Bishop <HI>(though otherwise he might be improper) yet herein shewd great civility by considering the Womans condition, and gave liberty for speaking to the full, with replying no discomfor|table Words, yea in Christianity delayed further prosecution until she was delivered, though afterwards they acted their improper perse|cution.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But into what a condition shall we be brought (I hope not into an high</HI> Commission <HI>nor</HI> Inquisition Court) <HI>if this</HI> Imprimator <HI>goes on, that none shall speak, no not so much as suffered to desire to speak, though they are great with Childe with the Man Christ Jesus: But I hope the People will see their Liberties, and your selves know this was not the true Apostles practices.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Your sad quenching of the Spirit when the motion of it arose in any for Soul-satisfaction in any to speak,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Quenching of the Spirit</HI></NOTE> you would not suffer them to be expressed but shift them in their coming forth: O dear Friends consider, you would not be so dealt with: For what did you know but

<P N="3">3. <HI>Your Indecorum Behaviours both in words and gestures unto your elder</HI> Fellow-Servants <HI>&amp; aged</HI> Father <HI>complaining as not perform|ing your duty as young men according unto Rule of honouring gray hairs</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The insulting Spirit of the Quakers</HI></NOTE></P>

<P><HI>Again your improper charging of the complainant with mispend|ing of time, when in Truth it was your selves (in not suffering of him orderly to proceed) But by your often</HI> Iterations,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The true cause of our long dis|course at New|port</HI></NOTE> Tautologies, In|decorum Behaviours <HI>and</HI> Expressions, <HI>with improper Preachments at that time, and yet lay the defect upon the aged, and would not be sa|tisfied with his substantial Proofs, divine Reasons and Argumental Demonstrations. And herein your Conscience (if unsatisfied) had liberty in timely Order, to have made your substantial Defence, if pa|tience had been suffered to have had her perfect work. It is acknow|ledged by Auditors, that as the Complainant brought substantial proof (for so far as he proceeded) so you the Defendants also brought substan|tial defence (in what was substantial) but now, who shall judge? ye will not suffer the Gospel rule, that the standers by, the Spirits of the Pro|phets shall judge. Then both of your own private Interpretations doth aim to be judges, and so will be endless and true judgeless: And by proceedings, the cause of Christ Jesus (being now at stake) much dishonoured unto the sadness of my Soul and unsatisfied Conscience, and also the expectation of the Auditors which was for Soul edifica|tion frustrated, and unto publick shame (as yet) only self-contend|ings hath the supream Appearance.

I reminded them first of the nature of the Word Spirit in La|tine <HI>Spiritus,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The word spirit</HI></NOTE> in Greek <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ma,</HI> in the Hebrew <HI>Ruch</HI> and <HI>Ruach,</HI> signifying sometimes <HI>Breath,</HI> sometimes <HI>Wind,</HI> and from thence applied unto God himself, unto Angels, unto Men, as denoting a spiritual, powerful, invisible fine substances distinct from flesh and earthly Bodies: Hence God was said to be a Spirit, not properly but that his Being was pure, powerful, invisible, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="1">1. Whether God was properly a Spirit (as the Quaker af|firmed) we had some controversie at <HI>Providence</HI> of which here|after.)</P>
<P N="2">2. Concerning Spirits, I observed two great Sects: 1 Those of the <HI>Pharisees</HI> (who were accounted to most Orthodox, Sound and right, holding such a Spiritual Substance in Angels and Spirits and a Resurrection. 2.

<P N="3">3. It is clear there is a two fold Spirit: 1.

<P>The other Spirit is a wicked Spirit, a lying, and a murtherous Spirit in Sathan and his Children, yet often counterfeiting the Ho|ly and pure Spirit, like the Oile and Ointment which God pre|scribed and forbad the like of it to be made on pain of death. Therefore we are commanded not to believe every Spirit, but to try even the very Spirits, not only of men but of <HI>Doctrines, Churches, Religious,</HI> pretending the Name of God, (as do the <HI>Turks, Jews</HI> and <HI>Christians</HI>) and of the Son of God. as do all the Antichrists and Antichristians extant.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>All Spirits must be tried.</HI></NOTE></P>

<P>But to return, while I was beginning to urge the tryal of the <HI>Spirits, W.

because their deeds are evil: This is the true cause of your quar|rel against the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> and of exalting the Spirit above them that is upon a true ballance, your own Spirit, yea the Spirit of Sa|than to be God, and Christ, and Spirit and all.</P>
<P>After some few interchanges and altercations,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The 4th Posi|tion concerning the Scriptures.</HI></NOTE> we descended to the fourth <HI>Position,</HI> which they read out of the Paper (as they did all the rest) which was this, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR><HI>That the People called Qua|kers did not own the Holy Scriptures.</HI></P>
<P>In one Copy it was written <HI>Really</HI> own, <ABBR>viz</ABBR><HI>They did not really own</HI> the <HI>Holy Scriptures.</HI></P>
<P>I said there was a twofold owning the <HI>Holy Scriptures</HI> or the Writings of God as there is a twofold owning the <HI>Scriptures</HI> or <HI>writings of men,</HI> the <HI>Proclamations</HI> and <HI>Declaration of Kings and Princes.</HI> The one is verbal and literal,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A twofold ow|ning of any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">crip|ture or Writing</HI></NOTE> <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> <HI>that such a writing or Declaration, or Treatise is extant, and that it proceeds from the Kings Authority and Command.</HI></P>
<P>The second is real and actual, when the Authority of it is in all humble obedience submitted to and obeyed: when the Justice and Equity, and the excellency and goodness, as well as the royal Au|thority is embraced and magnified.</P>
<P>I said the <HI>Jews</HI> owned verbally and wonderfully that Writings of the <HI>Old Testament</HI> and the <HI>Papists</HI> owned both old and new but it is known that in many particulars they do in effect deny and damn them.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Jews and Papists and Quakers all of them in effect deny the holy Scriptures.</HI></NOTE> 1.

<P N="2">2.

<P N="3">3. The Papists set up the <HI>Pope</HI> as the only infallible Judg &amp; Interpreter in all <HI>Questions</HI> about the <HI>Scriptures</HI> and the Jews make their <HI>Rabbies</HI> as so many <HI>Popes</HI> also.</P>
<P N="4">4.

<P>I said the Jews and Papists did not more disowne the holy <HI>Scrip|tures</HI> upon the account of their <HI>Popes and Traditions</HI> and Inter|pretations than the Quakers did up on the account of their <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>Interpretations</HI> also.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Quakers slighting the ho|ly Scriptures in many horrible Particulars.</HI></NOTE> Who knows not that in the beginning of their Profession, they generally fell from the read|ing of them by themselves or in their <HI>Families,</HI> or in their <HI>Publick Assemblyes,</HI> only crying up the <HI>Light within, the Spirit within, the Scriptures within, their Teacher within.</HI> They stil say <HI>The Scrip|ture was not the Word of God, the Scripture is but a dead Letter,</HI> they have no need of <HI>Paper-Teachers</HI> having the spirit that gave it forth?

<P>He Answers, <HI>And Christ faith no man comes unto the Father but by me: and he is able to the uttermost to save? and he shall be my Salvation to the end of the Earth saith the Lords and saith the Apo|stle, God is in Christ reconciling the World to himself, and he that hath the Son hath Life, and the Father and the Son are one, and there is no salvation in any other.</HI></P>
<P>I reply: I shall now freely declare to the Sence of this <HI>Allega|tion,</HI> though in the Dispute my <HI>Adversaryes</HI> would not suffer me to meddle with the Sence of <HI>G.

<P>G. <HI>Fox</HI> Answers, The Magistrate of Christ, the help, Govern|ment for him, he is in the Light and power of Christ: and he is to subject all under the Power of Christ, into his Light, else he

is not a Faithful Magistrate: and his Laws are agreeable and Answer according to that of God in every man: when men act contrary to it they do evil, so he is a Terrour to the Evil doers, discern the precious and the just from the vile, and this is a praise to them that do well.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> I urged from hence, that the <HI>Quakers</HI> (and G, <HI>Fox</HI> in his Book in many places) owne no Magistrates but such as are god|ly that is in their dark Sense, that be Magistrates for their Christ, be in the Light and Power of Christ,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Quakers Zealous Perse|cutors.</NOTE> for then say they, their Laws are agreeable to that of God in every man.</P>
<P N="2">2. These their Magistrates (in the Light) ought to subject even the Consciences and Souls of all that be under them, by <HI>Corporal punishments</HI> to come under the Power of Christ into the Light.</P>
<P N="3">3. This is Confirmed and sealed with a <HI>peremptory Doom</HI> upon the neglecter and failer, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> [<HI>Else he is not a Faithful Magistrate.</HI>]</P>
<P N="4">4. I observe the Reason and Equity which they alleadge of this subjecting all Subjects to the Light of Christ, because such <HI>Magistrates, Laws</HI> and <HI>Edicts</HI> are witnessed by God in every man, and therefore he sins against God himself who breaks such a <HI>Magistrates Command,</HI> and therefore is justly punished, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Upon my urging of some of these particulars some of them desi|red to hear the <HI>Quotation</HI> read again: So <HI>John Burnet</HI> read the whole passage again,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Yet will not own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE> and said, that G. <HI>Fox</HI> pake not there of matters of Religion and Conscience, nor of the Magistrates compelling men to be of his Religion and Conscience, but of punishing them for matters of wrong between man and man, which are against the Light in every mans Conscience, as <HI>Drunkenness, Whoredome, Murther, Stealing,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>I Replyed, the Terms were such both of the Question by the <HI>Opposite,</HI> and the Answer by G. <HI>Fox</HI> which argue and Compre|hend the matters of Religion and Conscience, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> If the Magi|strate be in the Light, and discern the mind of Christ, <HI>&amp;</HI> and G. <HI>Fox</HI> his Terms are the same about Christ and the Light and bringing them subject to Christ.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is not Imaginable, that the Opposer would question whether the <HI>Civil Officer</HI> ought not to punish such Incivilities

<P>This <HI>Assertion</HI> hath two main Branches: <HI>First,</HI> that the Qua|kers Religion is an <HI>Heresie,</HI> and themselves <HI>Hereticks</HI> in the mat|ters of Gods worship.</P>

<P>I told them <HI>first,</HI> that the word <HI>Hairesis</HI> Heresie, in <HI>Greek,</HI> (from whence the word <HI>Hairetkos</HI> an Heretick) signified an <HI>Opinion</HI> or <HI>Opinions,</HI> chosen and stood in by one or more against the <HI>Christian Religion.</HI> I said, the matter might be aggravated, and augmented from the Greatness and <HI>Vitallity</HI> of the matter of the Opinions, but the <HI>Formality</HI> and <HI>Nature</HI> of it lay in the will and obstinacy thereof.</P>

<P N="1">1. Then as to Repentance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Quakers Heresy in mat|ter of Repen|tance.</NOTE> I said it was the first heavenly and saving work of God upon the Soul, wherein he turned back home again the whole Soul unto himself, being revolted and run from him into Arms of Rebellion in the Fall of our <HI>first Parents.</HI></P>
<P>This was the great point preached by <HI>Moses</HI> and the <HI>Prophets,</HI> and more expressly by <HI>John the Baptist,</HI> and by the Lord Jesus himself: and when he sent abroad his Apostles or Messengers in|to all Nations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This 24th. of Luke I earnekly Insisted on.</NOTE> they were to preach the Gospel or glad News of the Forgiveness of sins according to <HI>Luke</HI> 24. <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that Repen|tance and Remission of sins should be preached in his Name unto all Nations, beginning at <HI>Jerusalem:</HI></P>
<P>Here about I remember they told me that it was known that they preached the Doctrine of Repentance and of turning from all sin unto God, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I Answered, that the <HI>Papists</HI> and they made a shew and Co|lour of Repentance, but it had not the Life and Substance of Repentance in it: It was no more but an <HI>empty Title</HI> and <HI>shadow</HI> of Repentance:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Papists and Quakers Repen|tance.</NOTE> we know the <HI>Papists</HI> define their Repentance by these three. <HI>First,</HI> Contrition, <HI>Secondly,</HI> Confession, and <HI>Third|ly,</HI> Satisfaction or Restitution.</P>
<P>But I said the <HI>Protestants</HI> protested against this Repentance of the <HI>Papists,</HI> and so against the <HI>Quakers,</HI> for, who knew not the sorrow and Confessions of <HI>Saul,</HI> and <HI>Ahab,</HI> and <HI>Pharaoh;</HI> and the <HI>Philistins,</HI> and <HI>Judas,</HI> yea, and also the Restitution which <HI>Judas</HI> made, (not daring to keep in his hands that which he had unjust|ly and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> gotten) and yet who can truly ascribe unto these mens Repentance, the Character and blessedness of a true Chri|stian returning and coming home to God.</P>
<P N="2">2. I said it is known in daily practice, that when some times
<PB N="116" REF="000228_0122_0FA36C334727CD68">
<HI>Notorious,</HI> and <HI>openly Flagitious Persons</HI> profess to be <HI>Quakers,</HI> (for all their craking of fear and trembling and Quaking) there hath appeared no Sense of godly sorrow, of godly Contrition and brokenness of heart in them, for their sinful Nature and Life against so <HI>Infinitely pure</HI> an <HI>Holiness</HI> and <HI>Majesty?</HI> but immed|diately (upon their bowing down to Satan,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Quakers Converts.</NOTE> and owning him as a <HI>Light,</HI> and <HI>Christ,</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> within them) they are, having left Prophaneness now pure and holy as God is, they can no more sin then Christ can! <HI>the Mistery of godliness is God manifested in their Flesh,</HI> I know some of them say they come to perfection by degrees, yet they say the least of their <HI>new-born Quakers</HI> can not sin, and what is that but Perfection? yea, they are Christ and God: and therefore why should they give respect to any <HI>King,</HI> or <HI>Kings,</HI> &amp;c. why should they not <HI>Thee</HI> and <HI>Thou</HI> the <HI>Aged, Learned, holy, and High,</HI> why should they not sit silent even scores and hundreths of them (possessed with a dumb Spirit) as in a Form and Order of Christian worship waiting for this Spi|rit, and then be perfect Christians?</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Protestants</HI> both <HI>English, French</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> &amp;c. have manifested against the <HI>Papists,</HI> and therein against the <HI>Qua|kers,</HI> that Repentance is a turning of the whole Soul from all sin as sin to all of God as God:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Protestants <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Repentance.</NOTE> from the sin of Nature, and that <HI>Heart filthiness</HI> which we bring into the world with us, and from whence, even from within, as Christ Jesus tells us? what ever Satan and the poor Quakers prate <HI>proceed our evil thoughts, Adul|teries, Fornications, Murthers, Thefts, Covetousness, Wickedness, Deceit, Lasciviousness, an Evil Eye, Blasphemy, pride, Foolish|ness,</HI> Mark. 7. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4.

<P>It is true, that many that hold the same <HI>Fanciful Notions</HI> with the <HI>Quakers,</HI> yet are of <HI>Ranting, jovial, spending Spirits,</HI> but the Spirit that haunts the <HI>Quakers</HI> most is a <HI>soure, proud,</HI> and <HI>Melan|choly Devils,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A sowre Spirit is the Common Spirit of the Quakers.</NOTE> and his Commission is to turn such persons into the <HI>Gadarens Swine</HI> rooting up all that ever they come at for their own Ends and Belly: How many are the Instances even in this <HI>Colony</HI> in some especially, as able and as active Souls as any in this <HI>Colony</HI> or <HI>Country,</HI> and as guilty of murthering the <HI>Natives</HI> by the <HI>Liquor Trade</HI> as any: and as suddenly and strangely snatcht away by the hand of <HI>Gods Power</HI> and <HI>Justice,</HI> as any usually can be, but being departed I will touch no more upon this string.</P>

<P>True Faith is a Receiving of Christ Jesus as my only King, Priest and Prophet: It is a believing on, or receiving of Christ distinct from God, <HI>John</HI> 14.

<P>In <HI>Pag.</HI> 127. he brings in <HI>John Bunyan</HI> saying, [<HI>It is a Coun|terfietlng of the New Birth for men to follow the Light wherewith men coming into the World are enlightned.</HI>]</P>
<P>G. <HI>Fox</HI> Answereth, [<HI>which none comes to the New Birth, but who comes to the Light, wherewith every man,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>which believ|ing in is a Child of the Light: believing and receiving comes to re|ceive power to be the Sons of God.</HI>]</P>
<P>I Reply,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The new Birth of the Quakers</NOTE> none are truly Converted, born again, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but in a true Sense they come to Christ Jesus: For the Scripture saith, <HI>He gives Repentance to Israel, He is the Author and Finisher of our Faith:</HI> But that Jesus Christ as God, (so the <HI>Quakers</HI> owne him) and as man (for so they also owne him) should be in every man, and Woman, and Child in the World, I have proved and shall prove it to be a <HI>blockish</HI> and <HI>Devilish Fancy.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. If this Light, this Christ the Mediator between God and man be only a Spirit and not man, why do the Scripture, why do the <HI>Quakere</HI> madly say there was such a man, though they can|not: tell now what is become of him except he be (as they say) within, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3.

seeing and awake, and using his Light and yet not see it. Certain|ly it is but a <HI>painted Sun</HI> that doth not shine equally on all, it is but a <HI>painted Fire</HI> that doth not burn, and the <HI>Quakers</HI> are but <HI>Pictures</HI> of <HI>Christians,</HI> and pictures of men to argue after such a Rate, that Christ not only as God, and Creatour should be in every man, but also as the Mediator, as the Spirit, and yet not operate according to the Nature of the Sun and Fire: It is true, the Lord Jesus came into the dark would, and their darkness com|prehended him not to be He that was to come, the <HI>true Messiah:</HI> but when Christ Jesus as Mediator, the true or only Light shall dwell in the Understanding and Will, and Memory, and Affe|ctions of a man or Woman, and those persons be savingly in|lightned by him as you write, and yet not Converted and saved by him, it can be the Language of none but those that peep and mutter, <HI>Isai.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. but have no true Light, but a false and painted Light within them.</P>
<P>Lastly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The true and false new Birth.</NOTE> saith <HI>Fox</HI> this turning to the Light within is the New Birth: But the <HI>Holy Record</HI> saith, that till the preaching of the Word, or Gospel, or glad News come to the mind of a man, (ordinarily by the Ear, and hearing, and preaching, <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.) there is no <HI>Faith,</HI> nor <HI>Covenant,</HI> nor <HI>Christ,</HI> nor God in the Soul, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 2. and we are not only in darkness, but darkness it self, <HI>Ephes.</HI> 5. and only by the holy Word and Spirit preached the blessing, <HI>Isai.</HI> 59., God shineth in our hearts, and not by any such <HI>Immediate Fantastick Faith</HI> or Spirit, as the <HI>Anti Christian Qua|kers</HI> dream of,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Quakers per out the Eyes of their own Ex|perience.</NOTE> yea, against the Light of a twofold Experience in their own Souls.</P>

<P>When God hides (that is by <HI>Spiritual Judgements</HI>) the Light of Scripture, of the Spirit of Reason, and of Experience, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who can find it out? No man, no nor Devil can subsist one mi|nute without the power of <HI>Christs Eternal Power and Godhead:</HI>

<P>I Reply, He that reads this passage may without doubting Conclude that G. <HI>Fox</HI> and his <HI>Foxtans</HI> are as <HI>perfect Pharisees (Jewish</HI> and <HI>Popish)</HI> as ever burroughed in <HI>Rome</HI> or <HI>Ierusalem,</HI> maintaining a Covenant of works,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Papists and Quakers see no need of Christ.</NOTE> Justification by works, and renouncing Christ Jesus his Blood and merits: For if <HI>Abraham</HI> was Justified and received his pardon by his Obedience to God what need was there for him and us, to look out for a <HI>Surety,</HI> a <HI>Re|deemer,</HI> a <HI>Mediator</HI> to pay his Blood for our Ransome, and to fetch us out of the <HI>miserable state</HI> of <HI>Sin; Death,</HI> and <HI>Hell,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. Whereas G. <HI>Fox</HI> asketh what is the work of God, but to do what he saith.</P>
<P>I Reply, 1. The work of God (according to Christs Doctrine) is to believe on him whom God sent.

(though <HI>Fox</HI> deny it,) it is the work, the <HI>great Work</HI> of God to fly to that <HI>blessed Propitia|tion</HI> for poor sinners, (throughout the world:) But G. <HI>Fox</HI> can|not distinguish between the <HI>Covenant of works,</HI> of <HI>Iustice,</HI> and of <HI>Debt,</HI> and that of <HI>mercy,</HI> and of receiving all as a <HI>Beggar,</HI> and Condemned Rebels, <HI>poor proud Souls</HI> they know not any differ|ence between the Blood of Christ Jesus and their own Blood, as we shall see afterward.</P>
<P N="3">3. Whereas he saith, they that do not Gods will are not justi|fied in so doing:</P>
<P>I Answer, therefore it follows ronndly as his Conclusion, that they that do Gods will are justified in so doing: that is their sins are pardoned as <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> by pardon of Sin describe justi|fication,</P>

<P>Unto this I adde, <HI>Pag.</HI> 248. where <HI>G.

<P>In which Answer it is plain, 1. that <HI>G. Fox.</HI> maintains that the Godhead is essentially and substantially in man.</P>
<P N="2">2.

<P>It is clear in these Passages,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Quakers make themselves Father, Son &amp; Holy Spirit</HI></NOTE> 1. That the <HI>Quakers</HI> make them|selves <HI>Father, Son</HI> and <HI>Holy Spirit.</HI></P>

<P>Again the same <HI>Author</HI> saith, <HI>it is Blasphemy to say the Son is not distinct from the Father,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>G. Fox</HI> Answers, the Father and the Son are one, the Father in the Son, and the Son in the Father: so that which is in him is not distinct from him, and they Blaspheme which say, the Son is not in the Father, and deny Christs Doctrine.</P>
<P>I reply, <HI>G.

<P N="2">2. For his Proof, it is <HI>the Childs song in the streets,</HI> they are one and therfore not distinct: I fear he knows, but will not know the nature of several respects and accounts <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that in one respect <HI>Christ Jesus</HI> saith, I and my Father are one, and in another respect my Father is greater then I; thus in one serce a <HI>Father</HI> is one with his Children, an <HI>Husband</HI> with his <HI>Wife,</HI> a <HI>Captain</HI> with his <HI>Souldiers,</HI> a <HI>Skipper</HI> with his <HI>Sea-men,</HI> a <HI>King</HI> with his <HI>Subjects.</HI> And yet in another respect, the Son is not the Father, the Wife is

<P>Much of this I spake publickly, as also that no <HI>Papist</HI> nor <HI>Qua|ker</HI> by their grounds could get up this <HI>Jacobs Ladder,</HI> much less upon those higher grounds and steps of casting off <HI>Self,</HI> of doing all purely for God, and in Gods eye: of meekness and Mercy to other poor drowning Soules,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Quakers and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"></HI></NOTE> of pure Love to God for <HI>Himself</HI> for his <HI>Holiness, Mercy, Goodness,</HI> yea for his <HI>Justice:</HI> of quiet and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and thankfull resting in his holy Pleasure, whatever he take from us or bring upon us.</P>
<P>I said and say, that neither the teachings of the <HI>Papists</HI> or <HI>Qua|kers</HI> will help them to get up one Step of this heavenly <HI>Ladder,</HI> for by the utmost strength and activity of <HI>Nature</HI> no man can advance and climbe higher then to love <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Christ</HI> and <HI>Heaven</HI> for it <HI>Self,</HI> and <HI>Self-ends,</HI> which is no more but <HI>Flattering</HI> of God, base and dog like <HI>Fawning</HI> and <HI>Hypocrisie.</HI></P>

<P>There be two other causes of falling into false Religions or ways of worshipping God.</P>

rotten in their <HI>Profession,</HI> and ready to fall and tumble when any <HI>stronge wind</HI> of Temptation blowes upon them.</P>
<P N="7">7.

<P>But generally they that are taken by the <HI>Quakers Bait</HI> are such as never truly loved <HI>Christ Jesus</HI> in Sincerity as the Scripture speaketh, (neither within nor without, and therefore suckt in <HI>Ni|colds</HI> and <HI>Nailors,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>But especially for Male and Female Prote|stants.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>Foxes</HI> dreames of a <HI>Christ,</HI> within them op|posite to <HI>Christ</HI> without: of a <HI>Christ</HI> a <HI>Light</HI> a <HI>Spirit</HI> within, which had no <HI>Humane Body,</HI> or if he were humane, or a man they know not now what is become of him.</P>

this time <HI>John Stubs</HI> told me that they (and I say, so do the <HI>Jesu|ites</HI> pretend to do) had left the Glory and Pleasure of this world their Wives and Children, Friends and Relations, to Preach the Everlasting Gospel; For the Woman had been 1260 years 42 months in the the wilderness, and she was now come and coming forth, and they were now preaching the everlasting Gospel, and therefore they advised me to make haste and dispatch and not to hinder the Lords work.</P>

<P>I Answered, that I understood what they said, and I understood mine own affirmation also; and desired their patience also while I offered my Proofs to two Particulars,</P>
<P N="1">1. That in their <HI>Books</HI> and <HI>Writings &amp;c.</HI> they do make their <HI>Sufferings</HI> a great Evidence to themselves and others of the truth of their <HI>Way</HI> and <HI>Spirit.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. This their <HI>Sufferings</HI> is not valid as to the proof of their <HI>Re|ligion, Way</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> to be of God. So then they bid me prove it if I could,</P>
<P>I told them that I could find no <HI>Jewes,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and the Quak suffrings</HI></NOTE> no <HI>Papists</HI> no <HI>Protestants,</HI> that did so magnifie and so exactly insist upon their <HI>Sufferings</HI> as the <HI>Quakers</HI> did.

<P>As I remember, <HI>John Stubs</HI> said, they did not boast of their
<PB N="176" REF="000228_0181_0FA36BA3498627F8">
Sufferings, but bare them patiently for the Truths sake which they preached and professed.</P>
<P>I said I did not charge them to say in express terms, We have lost so much outward <HI>Gain, Favour, Friendship, worldly Advan|tage</HI> for the Name of Christ within us, can you say the like for the Christ without you? We have endured <HI>Imprisonments Whip|pings, &amp;c.</HI> have you done the like? only this I say, that as all <HI>Religious Jewes, Papists, Protestants &amp;c.</HI> are confirmed in their Perswations by their <HI>Sufferings,</HI> and do predicate them to others as <HI>Arguments</HI> and <HI>Signs</HI> of the truth of their <HI>Doctrines,</HI> and of Gods presence and Assistance with them: so do the <HI>Quakers</HI> and that with more Particular and exact <HI>Accounts</HI> then most of all the rest have done.</P>
<P>I told them, I had observed much to this purpose in <HI>G. Fox</HI> &amp; <HI>E. Burrowes</HI> in the Book by me.</P>
<P>They bid me alleadge what I could out of them: I took up the Book,<NOTE PLACE="marg">E. Burrowes <HI>his Epistle Quo|ted.</HI></NOTE> and they theirs, I directed them to the 12th. Page of <HI>Ed.

Of this all the</HI> North Countreys <HI>can witness, And all these things are sustained and suffered from People and Ru|lers because of our</HI> Faithfulness <HI>to the Lord, and for declaring against the false Deceivers. For nothing Save only the hand of the Lord and his power, could have preserved us and carried us through all this: neither for any</HI> Reward <HI>outward whatsoever, or advantage to ourselves would we have exposed our selves to sufferings, violence and dan|gers which befel us daily. But the Lord was our exceeding great reward through all these things, and kept us in the hollow of his hand, and under the shadow of his wings, and gave us dominion in Spirit over all our enemies, and subdued them before us: and though Rulers and People were combined against us, and executed their violence and in|justice
<PB N="177" REF="000228_0182_0FA36BA406D2BFF8">
against us, yet the Lord made us to prosper and grow excee|dingly in Strength, Wisdome and Number and the hearts of the people inclined to us, and the Witness of God in many stirred for us: for to that in all Consciences, Words and wayes we did commend our selves to be known and approved.</HI></P>
<P>Hereto they suddenly said, What canst thou make of this, but that <HI>Edward Burrowes</HI> said the truth, that the Sufferings of the people called <HI>Quakers</HI> were very great, &amp; that he acknowledged the powerfull hand of the Lord toward them in supporting and delivering them: But this was far from boasting or making it any <HI>Evidence</HI> of the truth of their <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Principles.</HI></P>
<P>I replyed, I prayed them to consider why pious and conscien|tious Souls(as they would be reputed) should give so large a <HI>Catalogue</HI> of their <HI>Sufferings.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Quotation weighed.</HI></NOTE> 2. Profess it was only for their <HI>Faithfulness</HI> to the Lord. 3. Declare that it was the hand of the Lord that kept them. 4.

Why should wise men use all these words but to this end, of <HI>Evidencing</HI> their <HI>Faithfulness</HI> to God, and Gods <HI>Faithfulness</HI> to them.</P>
<P>After some words had about these kind of passages in <HI>Ed. Bur|rowes</HI> and other of their Writings, I told them that we must come to that ancient and true Maxime, <HI>Causa facit Martyrem,</HI> not the Suffering of Burning it self that is the evidence of a true matter.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>What true Suf|fering is.</HI></NOTE> I therefore told them that' as it was in the case of Signs Wonders <HI>Deut.</HI> 13. though they be Signs which false <HI>Prophets</HI> give, which come to pass, yet God commands his Children not to be mo|ved from his written word, and his holy revealed and recorded <HI>Ordinances</HI> and <HI>Institutions.</HI></P>
<P>I told them that I had other places which I had turned down in <HI>Edward Burrowes</HI> to produce; but these I had suppressed in my thoughts for expedition sake, and would if they pleased pass on to my proof of my next <HI>Position;</HI> to this they readily assented: but being now out of my Shackles of a quarter of an hour(to which I wink'd to draw them on) I crave the Readers Patience and leave to hear me say something now which then I could not say.</P>

First. To what I have said before of <HI>E.

[<HI>And there is a Proof to thee that the</HI> Quakers <HI>are sent of God who speak to thee of the Scripture right as thy are</HI>] He that reads the place shall see that <HI>G. Fox</HI> useth these words against his Op|posite <HI>Jeremiah Jewes,</HI> because that his Opposite had said, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> That the <HI>Word of God</HI> was contained in the <HI>Scripture:</HI> and <HI>G. Fox</HI> checks him for it and saith if he had said [the word which it speaks of] he had spoken right <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And this <HI>G. Fox</HI> makes and <HI>Evidence</HI> of the <HI>Quakers</HI> being sent of God, that they only can speak <HI>proper|ly.</HI> How much more is what I have produced (and have much more to produce) a <HI>Proof</HI> that they do roll their Souls upon their <HI>Sufferings</HI> as an <HI>Evidence</HI> and Confirmation that they are sent of God?</P>
<P N="2">2. It is wonderfull what the <HI>Jewes</HI> and <HI>Papists</HI> have suffered for their <HI>Lyes</HI> and <HI>Biasphemyes:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The wonderfull sufferings of M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">reticks</HI></NOTE> What a wonderfull Story doth <HI>Ma|nasseh Ben-Isrel</HI> relate of a Noble man, a <HI>Portugal,</HI> turned <HI>Jew,</HI> burn'd in <HI>Portugal</HI> for the <HI>Jewish Faith?</HI> What <HI>Devotion</HI> and <HI>Zeal</HI> have many of the <HI>Popish</HI> Party shewn at <HI>Tiburn?</HI> Sure it is that a natural <HI>Valour</HI> and <HI>Magnanimity,</HI> a natural <HI>Melancholy</HI> and <HI>Stoutness,</HI> a natural <HI>Pride</HI> and <HI>Vain-Glory</HI> will give wings which fire and Burning cannot scorch and conquer.</P>
<P N="3">3. I doubt not but that tis possible for not only <HI>Christians,</HI> but also <HI>Jewes</HI> and <HI>Papists</HI> &amp;c. like <HI>Paul</HI> in his mad <HI>Conscience,</HI> to be zealous for his <HI>Conscience,</HI> and to put others to death for their <HI>Consciences,</HI> and yet neither of them to sin against their <HI>Conscien|ces,</HI> but ignorantly as <HI>Paul</HI> did.</P>
<P N="4">4. I believe that not only <HI>Paul,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Great failing of Gods Chil|dren in this life.</HI></NOTE> and such as he, in Unbelief may so practice, but even the true Saints and Children of God. He that shall ponder the Fathers <HI>Poligamy,</HI> the best Kings of <HI>Judah</HI> suffering the <HI>High places, Davids</HI> slaying <HI>Uriah, Asahs</HI> imprisoning the <HI>Prophet, Peters</HI> rash using the Sword, <HI>Davids</HI> and <HI>Nathans</HI> unadvised <HI>Advise</HI> to build God a Temple, the <HI>Disciples</HI> calling for Fire from Heaven, and shall see cause to reprove the <HI>Quakers</HI> for their rash damning of others from whome they have suf|fered.

<P N="6">6. Because the <HI>Quakers</HI> do so abundantly glory in their <HI>Suffe|rers,</HI> and (in comparison of them) slight the <HI>Saints</HI> under the <HI>Al|tar</HI> (in our <HI>Book of Martyrs,</HI> as <HI>James Parnel</HI> impiously calls it) casting all that differ from them into the <HI>Satanical Delusion,</HI> and <HI>Serpentine nature,</HI> as <HI>Fox</HI> doth. <HI>Pag.5.</HI> and 253. and 99. Who forbids to receive into their Houses, no not Kings and Princes, nor to bid them <HI>God speed</HI> that are not in their Light.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>True and False Sufferers for the Name of Christ.</HI></NOTE> I think it fit to observe at this Turn some Differences between true <HI>Suffe|rers</HI> and false, both pretending the Name of <HI>Christ Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>First, The Persons whome the heavenly man <HI>John Fox</HI> des|cribes, they were men and women known to be of holy and hea|venly Spirits towards God, and of low and meek Spirits towards all, yea their very enemyes. I would I could say so of the <HI>Qua|kers</HI>(though no question but a <HI>a gold Ring</HI> may fall into the <HI>Chan|nel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Quakers described.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>Jewel</HI> into the <HI>Dirt</HI> of worldly and <HI>Antichristian errors</HI>) But for the <HI>Quakers</HI> I have cause to fear that generally they are <HI>Proud, ambitious,</HI> and <HI>Worldly-minded</HI> Wretches. Some of them have literal <HI>Knowledge</HI> of the <HI>Scripture,</HI> and some stirring <HI>Affecti|ons</HI> with the stony Ground, others with the thorny Ground have suffered formerly, but the Cares and lusts of this world have drild them into this way of Antichristian Worship. others are <HI>Fierce, Pragmatical, Discontented &amp;c.</HI> and they must travel and be <HI>Apostles</HI> to preach and bring in Proselites.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>J Fox &amp; G. Fox their Martyrs the contrary causes of their Sufferings.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>The Cause of <HI>John Foxes</HI> and of <HI>G. Foxes</HI> Martyrs differ as much as Day from Night, and Light from Darkness: For it is known that <HI>J. Fox</HI> his <HI>Martyrs</HI> or <HI>Witnesses</HI> (those blessed Souls under the Altar) were slain for maintaining the Authority and Purity of the <HI>Holy Scriptures</HI> as the revealed word or will of the <HI>Eternal God</HI> against the <HI>Traditions</HI> and <HI>Inventions</HI> of men.</P>
<P>But <HI>G. Foxes Sufferers</HI> have generally suffered for their <HI>Child|rens Banbles,</HI> fantastical <HI>Traditions</HI> and <HI>Inventions,</HI> for setting up a <HI>Dream</HI> of a <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Christ</HI> within all Man kind, above the <HI>holy Scriptures,</HI> above the <HI>Son of God,</HI> above all <HI>Earthly Dignityes,</HI> and all their <HI>Betters:</HI> endeavouring (with the Pope) to trample all <HI>souls</HI> and <HI>Bodyes</HI> under their proud feer.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="180" REF="000228_0185_0FA36BA7D8C31C80">
3. The carriage of these two Sorts of Sufferers differ as much as <HI>East</HI> from <HI>West,</HI> and <HI>Heaven</HI> from <HI>Hell.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The ground of <HI>Johns</HI> Sufferers was that which <HI>John</HI> so much writes of, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> love to the heavenly Bridegroom, without which <HI>Paul</HI> slights burning it self:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Heavenly love carried on G. Foxes even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> God and Christ &amp; Spi|rit.</HI></NOTE> this appears in their wonderfull Love to the holy Scriptures, (the Love-Letters of <HI>Christ Jesus</HI>) and unto all that loved <HI>Christ Jesus</HI> also. The Quakers are known to be Fierce, Heady, Proud, Self conceited, Stout, Bold, and driven on by an Audacious and Desperate <HI>Spirit</HI> (which <HI>G. Fox</HI> and some subtle <HI>Foxes</HI> with him have of late blamed in <HI>H. Norton &amp;c.</HI>) No question but some of them have a notion of <HI>Wrath</HI> yet to come, and therefore rather then to endure <HI>Hell Fire</HI> they will give up their lives to the Flames,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Virgin love to God, &amp;c.</HI></NOTE> others of them fast 40 dayes, and yet be far from true <HI>Virgin Love</HI> to the <HI>Son of God.

<P N="2">2. The carriage of <HI>J. Foxes Witnesses,</HI> though (in respect of Gods holy Truth) it was couragious and gallant, yet their low|liness and humility did shine forth gloriously also.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to God, being more sensible of their sins then of their sufferings: confessing with many tears that although God did turn their sufferings unto this Glory,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The humility of Christs sufferers</HI></NOTE> and although ungodly men (like Foxes and Wolves) hunted them like innocent <HI>Lambs</HI> and <HI>Chickins</HI>) yet they had deserved and calld for this Storm by their unthankfulness for their former peace and liberties, by their drow|siness and sleeping upon the Earthen bed of worldly Profits and Pleasures.</P>
<P>Contrarily it is known to all, that although sometimes the <HI>Qua|kers</HI> will say we come in love to your Souls yet) the <HI>Quakers</HI> are far from confessing their sins,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Devilish pride</HI></NOTE> as having no more sin then God hath and (according to their Principles and some of them say it) they can no more sin against God then God can sin against them.</P>
<P>As to Men Christs sufferers were meek, patient; respective, con|tented, thankful.</P>
<P>But as the <HI>Quakers</HI> hearts have an insensible brawniness and hardness (like frozen Rivers come over their hearts) in matters of God so as to men.</P>

1. Was there ever a People (Men and Woman professing such an height of Christianity) so fierce so heady, so high-minded and (though generally not hardned) so censuring, reviling, cursing, and damning: and so savage and barbarous as in the stark naked|ness of men and women &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">2. As to Revenge, how patient, and pitiful, and praying for their Enemies were <HI>J. Foxes Martyrs</HI> or <HI>Witnesses,</HI> and <HI>G.

<P>Tis true some of their Predictions have and may come to pass as do many also of <HI>Conjurers &amp; Witches,</HI> for the Devil knows the Complexion of persons and things, and what is like to come to pass (as in <HI>Souls</HI> case and in other events) and still the poor <HI>Quakers</HI> (and other his Captive Slaves) with such Bables as these.

<P>We now descended to the thirteenth Proposal (the sixth to be discus'd at <HI>Providence</HI>) which was read by them,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The 13 position discusd.</HI></NOTE> and is this, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> [<HI>These many Books and Writings are extreamly Poor, Lame, and Naked, swelled up only with High Titles and Words of Boasting and Vapour.</HI>]</P>
<P>I told them that I had not shun'd (as in the presence of the most High) to read any of their Books or Letters I could come at: but the truth is, I could never pick out any Wheat (of solid, rational and heavenly Truth) out of their heaps of Chaffe, and Dreams, and Fancies of new Christs, new Spirits, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It is true that <HI>W. Edmund.</HI> said, that the Word of the Lord
<PB N="182" REF="000228_0187_0FA36BAADA7646D8">
was a Fire, and a Hammer, &amp;c. But I said the word they meant was but a painted Fire, and a painted Hammer, and that never broke, nor burned up sin as sin.</P>
<P>Let a man read the Works of the <HI>Papists,</HI><HI>Lutherans, Arminians,</HI> and amongst our selves,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Quakers and other Au|thors compared</HI></NOTE> the <HI>Episcopal</HI> and <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Writings: a man shall have wherein to exercise his Judgement, Memory, &amp;c. he shall have Scripture proposed, Arguments alleadged, yea he shall read Answers and Replies, whereby to satisfie a rational Soul and Understanding.</P>
<P>But in the <HI>Quakers Books &amp;c Writings, Peter &amp; Jude</HI> tells us (what I have found) clouds high of an imaginary Christ and Spirit high swelling words, strange from the Holy Scripture Lan|guage, and all sober and Christian Writers and Speakers.</P>
<P>Let <HI>Jo.

<P>I have read <HI>Nichols,</HI> and <HI>Nailor,</HI> and <HI>Howgel</HI> and <HI>Burrows,</HI> and <HI>Parnel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>OF his Writ|ings poor and lame</HI></NOTE> and <HI>Farnworth,</HI> and <HI>Fox,</HI> and <HI>Dewsbury</HI> and <HI>Pennington,</HI> and <HI>Whitehead,</HI> and <HI>Bishop,</HI> &amp;c. And I could readily and abundant|ly prove my position out of all of them, but my desire and inten|tion was (as by my Paper to <HI>G. Fox</HI> appears) to have made it good to <HI>G. Fox</HI> himself, and to all Christians, how poor and lame, and naked <HI>G. Fox</HI> his writings are, who seems to be as <HI>Pighius</HI> and <HI>Echius</HI> amongst the <HI>Papists,</HI> and as <HI>Bellarmine</HI> the greatest Writer amongst them.</P>
<P>I told my <HI>Opposites</HI> I would therefore Answer this <HI>Bellarmine,</HI> and I would not say <HI>Bellarmine</HI> thou liest:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>OF his book in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">lio considered</HI></NOTE> but I would by Holy Scripture shew <HI>G. Fox</HI> and his deluding <HI>Foxians,</HI> how the old <HI>Fox</HI> the old <HI>Serpent</HI> was too crafty for them all, and had brought them and their Followers to the brim of the Lake that burns with fire and brimstone.</P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> then I said, let who will that understands true English, and are able to read and write true English (though he know no more) take <HI>G. Fox</HI> his Folio Book in hand, and tell me whether
<PB N="183" REF="000228_0188_0FA36BAB973709F8">
(though his whole Book) he writes like an <HI>English-man:</HI> And though he upbraid all his Opposites scornfully and ridiculously (as poor Children that know not the Bible nor their Accidence in say|ing <HI>you</HI> to a singular, &amp;c.) whether in many scores of places in his Book he confounds not the singular and the Plural: I confess when I urged this in publick, my Opposites desired of me no proof for this out of <HI>Foxes Bock</HI> and therefore (remembring quar|ter hour Glasse) I spared Quotations, but now (through Gods patience and my Readers) my Tedder being longer, I shall give one or two brief Proofs and Instances.</P>
<P>In page 282. in <HI>G. Fox</HI> his second Answer he faith, [<HI>You where you are sees him not</HI>] where it should be the Plural see him not, if this <HI>Proud Bruit</HI> had known either his Accidence or the Bible.</P>
<P>In Page 300. he saith [<HI>The Scriptures is able to make wise, unto Salvation</HI>] which should be are able, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In Page 16. [<HI>The Churches was to hear</HI>] for, were to hear.</P>
<P>In Page 110.

<P N="2">2. I observe throughout his Book a Devillish <HI>Black Line</HI> of despising those that are Good(as the Scripture speaketh)He counts none Godly but himself and his <HI>Foxians:</HI> yea there is no <HI>God,</HI> no <HI>Christ,</HI> no <HI>Spirit,</HI> but what is in him and them feelingly, though they say he is in every man and woman in the world, and <HI>Christ Jesus the Sun of Righteousness,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Horrible contradiction</HI></NOTE> and the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> and the <HI>King|dome</HI> of God, which they confess consists in Righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirits, and yet (as they impiously and simply speaks) these Inhabitants and Hosts to all these Guests know nothing of their lodging and dwelling within them.</P>
<P><HI>G. Fox</HI> gives a shrewd suspition that he never knew what the true fear,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The excellence men.</HI></NOTE> and love, and peace, and joy of God mean; if he did, is it possible that he could puff at so many Writers (excellent for great Knowledge and godliness, denying any thing of God or

Christ, or Spirit, or Grace to be in them: some of them (eminent servants of God) I have known:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Whom G F in his book in folio tranpleth on as Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hclouts Dogs &amp; Devils</HI></NOTE> of others of them I have smelt the <HI>Sweet Odour</HI> of an Heavenly report from the mouthes of others and in their Writings.</P>
<P>But as <HI>G. Fox</HI> will be found to adore an <HI>Image &amp; Crucifix</HI> for the true Lord Jesus, so whatever he say of others will his Faith, his Love, his Spirit of Discerning, and <HI>Hope of Glory</HI> and <HI>Salva|tion</HI> prove (without Repentance) dolefully false in the latter end.</P>
<P>For, doth not this <HI>Proud Censor</HI> know that men may be true Saints in their persons, and yet be subject to sudden <HI>Epileptical &amp; falling Fits?</HI> may not <HI>David</HI> walk with God with a perfect heart, and yet in the matters of <HI>Bathsheba</HI> and <HI>Uriah</HI> (and many other particulars) fall down like a Jewel into the Dirt? that Christ Je|sus owns <HI>Peter</HI> and his <HI>Confession,</HI> &amp;c. and yet in another case, <HI>get thee behind me Sathan?</HI> That <HI>Peter</HI> resolves to dye for Jesus, and yet denies with Cursing and Swearing, that he never knew him, and after <HI>Christs Resurrection</HI> and <HI>Ascention,</HI> even Peter plays the <HI>Hypocrite &amp; Dissembler.</HI></P>
<P>Yea did not the high Fathers in Godliness, famous Kings in Gods Church live long in the incivility of many Wives, and the impiety of Worshipping in the High places,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A difference of Sinners</HI></NOTE> &amp;c. to what purpose doth the Lord inspire his holy Pen-men to write these holy Histo|ries: was it to shame his Saints departed, or to shame his own Holiness, and to cast a stumbling block, and a protection for after sinners and transgressors? or amongst other holy ends to teach us (like <HI>Moses</HI>) to distinguish between an <HI>Egyptian</HI> whom he slew and the <HI>Israelites</HI> whom he chid for wronging each other, since they were their Brethren;<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>G. Fox no true Goldsmith.</HI></NOTE> so that he is a poor Christian Gold|smith, that knows not to discern the Gold of Holiness, and the Copper of Hypocrisie; yea, and to give the best <HI>Gold</HI> in the World its due allowance, with which it will pass currant in Earth and Heaven with God, and such who truly know and love him.</P>
<P>But with <HI>G. Fox.</HI> in all this great Book, the most humble and able, godly and conscientious are with him but <HI>Vipers, Serpents, Cains, Judasses, false Prophets, Pharisees, dumb Dogs, Sorcerers, Witches, Reprobates, Devils, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. In this Book of <HI>G. Fox</HI> (all along) he denies the <HI>Scripture</HI> to be the Word of God: and he said, that every man in the world hath that Spirit that give forth <HI>Scriptures,</HI> and that all Saints are

acted by the same Spirit immediately that moved the Prophets and Apostles and holy Pen-men of the holy <HI>Scriptures,</HI> all tending to <HI>vilifie</HI> and <HI>nullifie</HI> the <HI>Holy Scriptures.</HI></P>
<P>Besides, his <HI>Impiety</HI> in these Assertions (which half an eye of <HI>Mahumetans,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Fox his subtil|ty and yet sim|plicity in gran|ting the Script. to be the words of God.</HI></NOTE> <HI>&amp; Jewes &amp; Papists &amp; Protestants</HI> will see) I note his Simplicity (for a Fox though he be crafty is but a Beast still) For out of his <HI>Piety</HI> he grants the holy Scriptures through all his Book to be the <HI>Words of God,</HI> though not the <HI>Word of God:</HI> and for this his Grant be quotes <HI>Exod.</HI> 20. <HI>God spake all these Words,</HI> and the four Books of the <HI>Revelations,</HI> which I nor my Opposites could tell in publick what to make of: But if they are the <HI>Words</HI> of God, and some of them fearfully written by the in|conceivable Finger of God once and twice, then every particular <HI>word</HI> of these <HI>words</HI> must needs be the <HI>Word</HI> or <HI>Will</HI> or mind <HI>of God</HI> every grain of gold is gold, and every drop in the Ocean is Water and Salt too, as I urged to them before concerning every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God) else the <HI>Words of God</HI> when brought to particular examination, they are not the word of <HI>God,</HI> but of <HI>Angels</HI> or <HI>Men</HI> or <HI>Devills.</HI></P>
<P>How sweet are (not Words but) right Words: every man shall kiss his lips that gives a right Answer, how dirty then, how filthy and bloudy are those Lips that in so many places, debating with so many wise and learned and pious men, drop not <HI>Honey</HI> and <HI>Milk,</HI> but <HI>Wormwood</HI> and <HI>Gall</HI> the <HI>Venome</HI> and the <HI>Poyson</HI> of Asps to them that lick up such deceitfull and destroying <HI>Doc|trines.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. In <HI>G. Fox</HI> his Book I observe that all along he notoriously nibbles ar <HI>Words</HI> and quarrels at <HI>Words,</HI> which he faith are not <HI>Scripture,</HI> as that wicked word [<HI>Humane</HI>] relating to the Person of the Son of God and man.</P>
<P>Also the word <HI>Trinity</HI> and <HI>Sacrament.</HI> Oh how zealous is this Fox for the purity of <HI>Language?</HI> Why may not the word <HI>Humane</HI> be used as well as the word <HI>Sabboth</HI> and <HI>Sabbaoth,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The word Hu|mane abominable above all words to the Quakers.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>Bethlehem and Jerusalem</HI> which are Hebrew words, and as well as the words <HI>Baptisme</HI> and <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> which are Greek words, <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Scriptures</HI> and <HI>Pretorium</HI> which are Latine words. That word <HI>Humane</HI> is odious <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for <HI>Christ Jesus</HI> sake, and therefore the more I love and honour it, as expressing the appearance of God in Flesh, in that personal, Individual Flesh of <HI>Christ Jesus</HI> the

<P N="5">5. I observe the loose and wild Spirit of <HI>G. Fox</HI> in dealing with so many heavenly <HI>Champions.</HI> the Leaps and skips like a wild <HI>Satyre</HI> or <HI>Indian,</HI> catching and snapping at here and there a Sen|tence, like Children skipping ore hard places and Chapters, pick|ing and culling out what is common and easie with them to be paid of and answered.</P>
<P N="6">6. Any sober Soul may read in most of their Books,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The simple tau|tologies of the Quakers.</HI></NOTE> and in <HI>G.

How many hundred times have you, <HI>Christ is within you except you be Reprobates:</HI> Flesh of his Flesh and Bone of his Bone <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and I presume neer a thousand times if not a full thousand times repeated [That lightens every man that comes into the World, that lightens every man that comes into the world] &amp;c. <HI>G.

<P N="8"><PB N="187" REF="000228_0192_0FA36BB016CDD460">
8. I observe that <HI>G. Fox</HI> all along his Book powres forth a stood of <HI>Fire &amp; Brimstone</HI> against all his Oppsites and tells us that it is not <HI>Railing &amp;c.</HI> for (his chief <HI>Adversary</HI>)the holy Scrip|ture gives Instance of Christ Jesus himself giving such Language; and also it is no other then the Opposites to the <HI>Quakers</HI> give unto them: but Godly and Sober Souls will consider,</P>
<P N="1">1.

<P>We may observe in the holy <HI>Scripture,</HI> that generally they were <HI>high handed, hypocritical</HI> and <HI>hardned</HI> Sinners against whome the holy Spirit thundred out such <HI>Titles,</HI> threatnings and Judg|ments: But <HI>Fox</HI> in this place makes no Distinction, but as boldly as <HI>Blind Bayard</HI> saith all that differ from us <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>

<P N="3">3. It is <HI>G.

<P N="4">4. As we say in the death of the <HI>Martyrs</HI> or <HI>Witnesses</HI> of <HI>Jesus,</HI> it is not the <HI>Suffering,</HI> but the <HI>Cause &amp;c Spirit &amp; Cariage</HI> is to be considered: So in bitter Language,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>What Railing is</HI></NOTE> it is not lawfull to call every <HI>Prince</HI> or <HI>King, Fox.</HI> as Christ called <HI>Herod:</HI> nor every Oppo|site <HI>Viper &amp; Serpent, Fool</HI> and <HI>Blind</HI> and <HI>whited painted Wall</HI> and <HI>Sepulchre</HI> &amp;c.

<P>Page 1. He brings in <HI>Sam. Eaton</HI> saying, [<HI>He doth not believe that there is Substantial, Essential Personal Union between the E|ternal Spirit and Believers.</HI>]<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Sam Eaton</HI></NOTE></P>

<P>I Reply: concerning the <HI>Essence</HI> or <HI>Being</HI> of the Immortal, In|visible, Infinite, Eternal, Omnipotent and Omniscient, and only Wise: we know no more then a Fly knows what a King is, and therefore 1 <HI>Time. 9.

<P>Is it not enough for Sun,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Gods being out of our reach</HI></NOTE> Moon and Stars, and Men to be en|lightned by his Infinity, but they must be God himself, and Light it self, in the highest sence, because God is Light, &amp;c.</P>
<P>What impudence would it be in a Wise, because she is one with her Husband in Relation, to say, She is the Husband himself, and not to keep her just distinction and distance? or in a Subject (be|cause the Subjects and the <HI>King</HI> are Relatives, and in a sence one)
<PB N="189" REF="000228_0194_0FA36BB18D3D34B8">
therefore to say, that they are the <HI>King himself?</HI></P>
<P>Again, we know that the word <HI>Spirit</HI> is taken in <HI>Holy Scripture</HI> for a <HI>Spiritual Nature.</HI> Hence it is said that God is a Spirit, not that God is properly a Spirit, no more then he is Light (though my Opposites in our Dispute affirmed he was) but of such a Heavenly and Spiritual Nature:<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The nature of Spirits</HI></NOTE> For the Devils also are Spirits, though defiled with sin and wickedness: thus <HI>Joh. 3.

<P>And that <HI>1 Cor.6.</HI> shews us in what respect he that is joyned to the Lord is one Spirit: For know you not (saith <HI>Paul</HI>) <HI>that your Bodies are the Temples of the Holy Spirit:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>How God and Christ is in us.</HI></NOTE> and <HI>Ephes.2.</HI> For an Habitation of God through the Spirit.</P>
<P>Thus God dwelt in his Temple of old, as a Man in his House, and a King in his Palace: not that a Mans House, or the Kings Palace is of his Substance or Essence no more then an house is of the Suns Essence, &amp;c and no more was Gods Temple of old, nor his Temples his Saints now, after the blockish and blasphemous nonsence of the <HI>Quaker.</HI></P>

<P>I Reply, as the Sun in the Heavens is the Epitomy or Center of all Natural Light, though some eyes are sore, look a squint, or are stark blinde.</P>
<P>And as the Rule or Canon (though <HI>Fox</HI> simply bogles at that as not a Scripture word) is the same, for it is in the Greek, though millions know it not, and millions (as the <HI>Pharises</HI>) pervert and misapply it.</P>

<P>A ninth Instance is in page 28. where G.

Hence Christ Jesus above all other wayes of Gods manifesting himself ex|ternally or outwardly is called the Word of God, and the Word which was God. Hence in common speech we call our Thoughts our selves [<HI>So I think, &amp;c. this is my Word, my Vote, or Mind.</HI>]</P>

<HEAD>AN APENDIX OR Addition of Proofs unto my thirteenth Po|sition, <ABBR>Viz.</ABBR>
<HI>That the Quakers Writings are Poor, Lame and Naked (not able to defend themselves, nor comfort the Souls of others with any solidity.</HI>)</HEAD>
<P>I could produce most of their chief extant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">More Proofs of the Quakers lame writings</NOTE> but I have been occasioned to deal with <HI>G. Fox,</HI> their <HI>Goliah,</HI> in some Scores of Passages of his Book in Folio, in the <HI>Narrative</HI> afore|said.</P>
<P>Unto which I judge fit to adde the Scores following, faithfully presenting his Opposites, Words (as he quotes them) his <HI>Answers</HI> and then my <HI>Reply:</HI> let him that Readeth understand.</P>
<P>I Have chosen our the short Assertions of <HI>G: Fox</HI> his <HI>Opposites</HI> as be quotes them, and his short Answer for brevity, sok, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The first of this Addition I name, is in <HI>Pag.</HI> 6. of <HI>G.

<P>I Reply, 1. I cannot learn that they litterally hold, that they know all things knowable as God (though G.<HI>Fox</HI> writes that they know all things as God) yet I cannot think them so gross as to imagine that they know all things, past, present and to come, (as the Devil pretends he doth, and offers to reveal so much to some Conjurers) but I judge they must come to some figurative meaning, as their opposite writeth.</P>
<P>For 2. What hinders (as before) but if the <HI>Quakers</HI> be Om|niscient, and know all things, but they should be also <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> and do all things, for so <HI>Paul</HI> writes, <HI>Phil.</HI> 4. <HI>I can do all things:</HI> I know they say, they are one with God and Christ, and they know all things, and can do all things; and yet this sense which litterally is so Proud and Blasphemous, must be made out by a meaning and by figure (which they cry out against in others.)</P>
<P N="3">3.

<P>I Reply: G. <HI>Fox</HI> is in his <HI>Burrough</HI> of the various Sense of the word Form:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The word Form debated</NOTE> It hath respect to <HI>Nature,</HI> to <HI>Art,</HI> to <HI>Civil, Natural,</HI> and <HI>Divine matters:</HI> Shall now (like a Fool and a mad man) Cry down all <HI>Natural, Civil,</HI> and <HI>Divine Beings?</HI> Are not all the <HI>internal</HI> and <HI>external Forms,</HI> shapes, or Beings of the Crea|tures in <HI>Heaven, Earth,</HI> and <HI>Sea,</HI> of <HI>Angels, Sun, Moon,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Men, Birds, Beasts, Fishes,,</HI> admirably glorious and <HI>stupendious?</HI> G. <HI>Fox</HI> runs to the Picture, or Forms of these Forms, and faith childishly, that the Form or picture with u the Life is nothing: who knows not that, that as to Life it is as good as nothing.</P>

<P N="3">3. Did the Servants of God ever labour to bring and hale off Gods people from the worship it self, but only from the dead and meerly formal using of them, until the time appointed by God himself for their withdrawings, disappearing and abrogation. What a shameless falshood is it that any of Gods Messengers brought Gods people off from those <HI>heavenly Fabricks</HI> which God erected by their Ministry or Service all the World over?</P>
<P N="4">4. May, not <HI>Gods Messengers</HI> now Cry out against the <HI>apish Imitations</HI> &amp; <HI>Formalities</HI> of the <HI>Papists</HI> (so horribly and bloodily) abusing <HI>Prayer, preaching, Baptisme,</HI> the <HI>Lords Supper, Ex|communication,</HI> &amp;c. but (like the <HI>Assyrians</HI> or <HI>Babilonians,</HI> Psal. 74.

<P N="6">6. Tis true, the Protestants have made separation from the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> as <HI>whorish</HI> and <HI>Bloody:</HI> in order to the Return to the first Primitive purity, from which the whose of <HI>Rome</HI> hath departed.</P>
<P N="7">7. G. <HI>Fox</HI> Cries out against all Scripture and Common Sense, against all Forms, that is, wayes and manners of Gods worship: Cries up a Christ within, <HI>Scripture within, Church within, Mini|sters within, Baptisine and Supper within,</HI> yet practice they most of these [so many as their Idol requires] and will serve his turn) as outwardly and visibly as any in the world</P>
<P N="8">8.

and that [although some rotten Professors, or weak Souls though true] have been bewitched by those Soul-witches yet generally [where they have any Liberty] the <HI>National Church</HI> fills up their numbers:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whence the Quakers Prose|lites do arise</NOTE> My Reason I gave them in publick, when W. <HI>Edm.

<P>A 9th.

<P>I Reply, Some of this his Answer, is some of his wonted <HI>Non|sence,</HI> or the Printers oversight, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But to the point the great Jugler hath taught G. <HI>Fox</HI> and his <HI>Foxians</HI> a trick to on face <HI>Death</HI> and <HI>Judgement.</HI> They now keep the great Sessions and call all the world to their <HI>Bar</HI> and Judgement.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The two preten|ded last witnes|ses Reves and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE> Thus did the poor cheated Souls in <HI>London</HI> lately <HI>Reeves</HI> and <HI>Mugleton</HI> thunder out their eternal Sentence of Damnation upon the Souls and bodies of their <HI>Opposites,</HI> &amp; that with such Seriousness, Confidence &amp; Ma|jesty, that I have known sollid Christians put into a fright by them.</P>

<P N="1">1.

As to this <HI>Immortality</HI> of G. <HI>Fox:</HI> all that can be known of his mind is old H. <HI>Nichols</HI> and the <HI>Nicolaitans</HI> mad fictions and fancies of their becoming God and Christ.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Charitable hope of some Quakers.</NOTE> I hope charita|bly of many of them, that run in their Simplicity, Ignorance and weakness with a true Love to the true Lord Jesus as some did with <HI>Absolom</HI> who truly loved <HI>David</HI> but as for <HI>Absolom</HI> himself the Polititians, the subtle Plotters, and <HI>Abitophels</HI> who love not the true Lord Jesus in sincerity, I fear instead of their fancied Im|mortality before the Grave they will meet with a dreadful Mor|tality, or death of Soul and Body to Eternity.</P>
<P>A 12. Instance is,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Joseph Miller,</NOTE> <HI>pag.</HI> 47. where be brings in <HI>Joseph Miller,</HI> saying, <HI>[The wise heathen Philosophers had a greater Measure of Light in them</HI> (which is the first <HI>Adam) then I can think any man hath now]</HI></P>
<P>G. <HI>Fox</HI> Answ. which shews, that he knows nothing of Christ the <HI>second Adam,</HI> the quickning Spirit.

<P>I Reply, 1. I know it pleased God (in all Ages) to stir up the Spirits of some Men (as the Philosophers amongst the Greeks

<P N="2">2. This wily Fox he runs to his hole and Confounds this Common Light of Reason, with Christ and God himself, who also are called Light by Similies from the Creature:.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Question then follows: If this Light of Knowledge were Christ, as God, and King, and Mediatour: why is it that none of these excellent Men knew nothing of God, nor Christ, nor Spirit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The madness of George Fox his Fancy about them.</NOTE> (Name <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Thing) but only of the first Creation: Can such a Court be kept, a Palace furnished, and such Royal and heavenly Guests be entertaind, and no Body know any thing of it, nor themselves neither; when Christ Jesus came into <HI>Jeru|salem</HI> (though but in a poor Contemptible way) all <HI>Jorusalem</HI> was moved at his coming: and shall this most glorious King (now infininitely more glorious) make his Ingress into the Souls of such wise and Excellent Men, and neither they, nor others hear of it until just now, (twenty years since) Some cheated Souls dream of it.</P>
<P N="4">4. The utmost of Reason in these Excellent Men, it is known I say, that the Activity of the highest Reason in this World falls short in two grand particulars.</P>

<P>G. <HI>Fox Answers</HI> Contrary to the Apostles Doctrine and the mind of God and the Prophets, who said, <HI>God would pour out of his Spirit upon all Flesh, and his Sons and Daughters should Pro|phesit:</HI> So that he is a limiter of the Holy one, a quencher of the Spirit, and in the Darkness, and this is above the Light of Na|ture.</P>
<P>I Reply, First, What is the Light of Nature, but that Light in which every man comes into the World with (as the <HI>Foxians</HI> speak) a Light differing from that Light which Beasts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The light of Na|ture discussed</NOTE> wilde and tame, and Birds, and Fishes have: And a Second Light differing from what is Supernatural, as that Light revealed from Heaven in the Holy Scriptures, and infused into the Souls of Men by the Holy Spirit or Power of God.</P>
<P N="2">2. What is the Light of Nature in Man, but that Order which the most Glorious Former of all things hath set (like Wheeles in Clocks or Watches) a going in all his Creatures?</P>
<P>Some have observed that in the Insensible Creatures to which the most High hath only given Beings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Male and Female</NOTE> that there may be obser|ved a Male and Female amongst them.</P>
<P>This is more observable in Vegetables or growing Creatures, as in Plants, Trees, Herbs, Flowers, &amp;c.</P>
<P>More yet in Sensitives, as Birds, Beasts, Fishes.</P>
<P>Most of all in Rationals: Men and Women, whom the most High hath so wonderfully distinguished.</P>
<P>It is true, that in Religious and Christian Matters, there is no
<PB N="26" REF="000228_0239_0FA36C0706376E40">
respect of persons with God, as of Man before the Woman: otherwise then to order Natural and Civil.</P>
<P>The Woman is Predestinated, is Called, is Justified, is Glori|fied,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Men on dom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n compared</NOTE> and wears that Golden Chain as well as the Wisest and Strongest of Mark<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nde.</P>
<P>And it is true, the Wisdome of God prefers some Women before thousands of Men, in their being born of Nobles, in ex|cellent parts (as is observable in the Lady <HI>Jane,</HI> and Queen <HI>Eliza|beth,</HI> &amp;c.) in some special favour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The kindness of God to women</NOTE> as Christ Jesus first appearing to <HI>Many Magdalen</HI> and other Women, and sending them to car|ry the first Tydings or Gospel of his Resurrection to his Apostles: yea, in effusions or powrings forth of an extraordinary measure of his Spirit before Christs coming, as on <HI>Miriam, Deborah, Anna, Huldah,</HI> &amp;c. and at his coming (according to <HI>Joels</HI> Pro|phesie) on his Daughters as well as his Sons (so that as my opp|sites alledged to me in publick: <HI>Philip</HI> the <HI>Evangelist</HI> had four Daughters thus extraordinarily endewed) yet this favour of God toward Women destroys not the order which the God of Order or Nature hath set in those Bounds, and Limits, and Distinctions between the Male and Female, the Man and Woman: though the Holy Scripture were silent, yet Reason and Experience tell us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Womens unfit|ness for manly employments</NOTE> that the Woman is the weaker Vessel, that she is more fitted to keep and order the House and Children, &amp;c. that the Lord hath given a covering of longer Hair to Women as a sign or tea|cher of covering Modesty and Bashfulness, Silence and Retired|ness: and therefore not so fitted for Manly Actions and Employ|ments.</P>
<P>Therefore because of <HI>Joels</HI> Prophesie, or because we must not limit or quench the Spirit, as G. <HI>Fox</HI> saith, there is no ground in Gods ordinary course of Nature to permit Women to pretend to be Apostles or Messengers to the Nations, or Preachers and Tea|chers in the Publick Assemblies.</P>
<P N="1">1. Because we finde no such Commission given by Christ Je|sus or any such Practise amongst the first Believers.</P>
<P N="2">2.

<P N="4">4.

<P N="5">5. It is a <HI>Hellish Mystery</HI> of the <HI>Devil</HI> to Cozen poor Souls with a Notion of the Difficulty and height of their Profession, and of worshipping God in Spirit and Truth, which they say no Body in the World do but they, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and yet the Truth is as I told them in publick, there is an Image in the Bed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The feined hardness but the real easiness of the Quakers Spi|rit.</NOTE> but <HI>David</HI> was gone, yea, and that their Religion was one of the easiest Re|ligions in the world.

<P>A 17<HI>th. Inst.</HI> is in <HI>ag.</HI> 63. where <HI>G. Fox</HI> brings in his Adver|sary <HI>Jeremiah lves</HI> saying,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jeremiah Jves</NOTE> [<HI>There may be a Light to Convince of Sin, and yet not within man</HI>] He Answers, there is no people

Convinced of Sin, but they are Convinced within themselves and with the Light within them: It is the Light which makes manifest to a man when he is Convinced: It Answers to some|thing, and reacheth to something in their particulars, though the words be spoken without them from the Light.</P>
<P>I Reply, <HI>First,</HI> it is a doleful Business to read and here how <HI>Satan</HI> (in his <HI>Chains of Darkness</HI>) yet hath Liberty to appear abroad as an <HI>Angel of Light</HI> from Heaven,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Devilin Samuels <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE> thus vapouring and swaggering under the Cloak and Colours of Light, the Light which is Christ, <HI>the Light by which all things were made, the Light that was glorified with the Father before the World was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An Angel of Light but a Dra|gon and Devil of darkness.</NOTE> the Light that enlightens every man that comes into the World: the Light with|in you,</HI> &amp;c. the Light which will <HI>guide</HI> you up to <HI>God,</HI> up to <HI>Christ,</HI> up to <HI>Salvation</HI> and <HI>Eternal Life,</HI> and yet all this vapourings and Crakings are but Cheatings from <HI>the God of this World,</HI> whose eyes being beat out by Gods most righteous Sentence, he labours to keep all in <HI>blindness,</HI> or to beat out the eyes of those whom God hath truly enlightned.</P>
<P N="2">2. As I have said before, and I said truly, the word <HI>Light</HI> is a <HI>Similitude</HI> from <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>darkness</HI> though my Opposites in the dispute affirmed, that God was Light in a <HI>proper</HI> and not <HI>figura|tive Sense,</HI> and it signifies and intends Truth of all Sorts, whether <HI>Natural,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Truth and Light the same thing.</NOTE> <HI>Moral</HI> or <HI>Heavenly:</HI> The natural Truth or Light is re|ceived within by a natural Light or understandings: The Civil and moral Light or Truth suits and agrees with those moral and Civil Convictions of the natural Light and understanding? Hi|ther to Natures Light will reach. But when we m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">unt up to Di|vine and <HI>Supernatural Truth,</HI> here these very <HI>Foxians</HI> confess that <HI>the Natural Man perceiveth not the things of God:</HI> Only they say, that beside Natural Light, Natural Reason, <HI>&amp;c</HI> there is the holy Seed God and Christ, <HI>&amp;c</HI> within every Son, and to this Spi|rit and Seed in Prison they preach, and <HI>Fox</HI> in our discourses al|leadgeth and affirmeth God (in every man) to be a <HI> Cart <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oaden with sheavs,</HI> prest under, and as it were in Prison, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> blasphe|mous wretches if they keep not, but go beyond <HI>Similitudes</HI> and <HI>Comparative Expressions</HI> to make us poor worms creep up to Heaven.</P>
<P N="3">3. All <HI>Light</HI> or <HI>Truth Natural, Civil,</HI> or <HI>Divine</HI> it comes from without, and is received by the <HI>Internal Faculty</HI> according

From thence it is conveyed to the <HI>Court of Guard,</HI> where Captain Reason or his Lieutenant, com|mon Sense and Experience taketh Examination, and Memory keeps a Record of proceedings which go on by degreen to Act|ions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. When I say it comes from <HI>without,</HI> I intend not that Truth or Light comes any other way from without, as by force and ravishment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Where no Re|ceiver no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE> <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I say any other way then there is a door &amp; Room and Receptive Faculty within willing to receive, and to make it welcome: This <HI>G.

I <HI>Answer,</HI> Natural Truth, or morals, Ci|vil matters are soon received by all Natural and Moral Under|standings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Natural Under|standing in M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n and Beasts.</NOTE> yea, in natural Commands and Threatnings, Beasts and Birds are admirably capacious and observant. But when we speak of <HI>supernatural Heavenly</HI> and <HI>Eternal matters,</HI> of <HI>Spi|ritual things</HI> to be discerned <HI>Spiritually:</HI> What a difference is there as between <HI>Heaven</HI> and <HI>Earth,</HI> and Infinitely greater?</P>
<P>When the <HI>Lord Jesus</HI> asked his Disciples <HI>how many loavs they had,</HI> their <HI>Natural Faculty</HI> or <HI>Reason</HI> could give an Answer: When he asked them <HI>whom do Men say that I the Son of man am?</HI> This was a <HI>Divine</HI> and <HI>Supernatural Question,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">An Instance of a meerly Ratio|nal and an heavenly Power and Faculty.</NOTE> and for the out|side and Truth of the Fact, the Devils could Answer as well as the Disciples, not only that same said he, <HI>was Elias, John Baptist</HI> &amp;c. but that he was the Son of God: All this exceeds not Na|tural first Birth Powers or Faculties: But to give a believing and an affectionate Answer as <HI>Peter</HI> did, this requires a <HI>Fa|culty</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> which <HI>Flesh</HI> and <HI>Blood</HI> could not reach too, but the Spirit or secret working Power of God in the means wrought <HI>Peters heart</HI> and the <HI>Disciples hearts,</HI> and to this day all <HI>Belie|vers Hearts</HI> to receive and welcome all truly Divine and Heaven|ly Doctrines.</P>
<P>Whereas therefore <HI>G. Fox</HI> talks of something within which is preached to: I may Answer as they do, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that the natural man perceivs no spiritual matter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A close Companion between <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> but when he is born again then he acts and works, and it is most certain, that as an House receivs his Master, as Candle kisseth Candle, the Clasp the Hook, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, so do Natural or Spiritual Faculties receive <HI>Natural</HI>

or <HI>Spiritual Faculties</HI> receive <HI>Natural</HI> or <HI>Supernatural Motions</HI> and <HI>Impressions.</HI></P>
<P>The Protestants say, that before it pleaseth God by some word read, preached, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to set up a Candle of wisdome in the Souls, and to work a spiritual savour in the Soul, all heavenly matters are na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">seous and odious, though as pleasant, profitable and ho|nourable, to self Ends they are welcome all the world over, yet as spiritual and heavenly abominable?</P>
<P><HI>G. Fox</HI> saith there is a something,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> a Seed, though but as a <HI>Grain of mustard Seed, a Seed of God,</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> to which Christ the Word is preached, and which maketh Answer: Hence (horribly abusing <HI>Scripture phrazes</HI>) they so often say God is all (within and without:) Hence they maintain, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> though men be dark and dead, yet Christ within is Light and a|live in them, and them only.</P>
<P>Hence appears <HI>G. Fox</HI> his lying Cheats of a <HI>Sufficient Light</HI> within to lead to God and to Salvation, a Teacher within all Sufficient, for then no need, yea, it is a simple Superfluity, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to hold a Candle of outword words to awaken and enlighten such a glorious all-Sufficient Sun within.</P>
<P N="5">5. I ask where this something, this something of God, (yea, God and Christ and Spirit) If he Answer, in the understanding he grants it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">About the Light <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to dark|ness.</NOTE> that is dark, and perceives no heavenly matters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> If in the Heart and Affections he Confesseth, all there, is hard and dead: only he saith, <HI>the Light shineth in the darkness,</HI> &amp;c. Im|plying that in the dark understanding there is some heavenly Light: in the hearts hardness there is some softness, and <HI>the Light shining in darkness,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I Answer, <HI>Christ Jesus the Sun of Righteousness</HI> arose with <HI>sa|ving Rayes</HI> or <HI>wings</HI> of <HI>Salvation,</HI> but the <HI>blind Jews</HI> could not own him for the <HI>Expected Messiah,</HI> what is this <HI>G.

<P N="2">2. What is this to all the Generations of the World about <HI>four thousand</HI> years before Christ came, and was in that <HI>visible person as John</HI> saith of him, <HI>that lightens every man that comes,</HI> &amp;c. what is this to a mixture of Light and darkness in the same facul|ty, the eye blind and yet seeing, the man dead and yet alive?

<P N="6">6. The Conclusion is, (as before I hinted) and they Confess, when God in his own Means ordinarily works the will to hear, to turn,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gods gracious workings with and in the Souls of men.</NOTE> to believe, to pray, he then graciously works the work for us, and being thus turned with <HI>Ephraim,</HI> we mourn and la|ment, and say, <HI>what have we done?</HI> when he turns our wilderness (wholly a wilderness) into a Garden, then we bring forth his sweet Fruits, Flowers, and Spices: when he turns the Wolf into a Lamb, then we are meek and Innocent, and patient: but to talk of preaching to the Spirits in Prison, yea, of the Seed of God and the Spirit of God in prison, when the Lord speaks of his warning and moving men by <HI>Noahs</HI> preaching in the <HI>old World,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A Wonderful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Religion,</NOTE> as may be evidently evinced,) is like the prophane teaching of <HI>Parrots</HI> to prate of Grace and Heaven, like that <HI>admirable Parrot</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> who could say her <HI>Pater noster,</HI> her <HI>Creed,</HI> and <HI>Ten Command|ments,</HI> and yet knew as much of grace and the workings of God in the Soul, as her <HI>Popish Teachers,</HI> &amp;c.</P>

<P>The 25. Instance is in <HI>Pag.</HI> 90. He brings in the same Author saying, [<HI>There is a kinde of Infiniteness in the Soul, and it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Infiniteness it self.</HI>]</P>
<P>He Answers: Is not the Soul without beginning coming from God,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Soul man horribly abused</NOTE> and returning into God again, who hath it in his hand, which Hand goes against him that doth Evil, which throws down that which wars against it: and Christ the power of God the best of the Soul, which brings it up into God, which came out from him; hath this a beginning or ending? and is not this In|finite in it self, and more then all the World?</P>
<P>I Reply, More briefly, (having spoken of the Soul before) That the Soul or Spirit of a Man should be boundless or without limits, without beginning or ending, in a <HI>Blasphemous Monster</HI> begotten of <HI>Hellish Pride</HI> the Father, and <HI>Hollish Ignorance</HI> the Mother: for Infinity and Infiniteness in that sence can be no other but the Infinite and Eternal Power and Godhead transcen|ding the Capacity of Men or Angels to receive it or conceive the nature of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is true in a secondary way (<HI>a posteriori</HI>) as they say the Spirits of Angels and men are as a Lamp lighted up by the most high and
<PB N="50" REF="000228_0263_0FA36C190664DB28">
Infinite Majesty never to go our or be extinguished in joy of sorrow, This Notion dazes the most sober and steady Eye and Br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ine; but who can finde a Center or Clod of standing from whence to entertain a thought of no Beginning; no created finite power can reach to what Infinity is.</P>
<P N="3">3. We see the mighty Kings and Emperours, their mighty Armies and Navies have Bounds as the roaring Waves of the Ocean have: the most Glorious Sun and heavenly Bodies have their limited Motions:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The changes of all things creat|ed and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> the Dayes and Nights, the Summer and Winter, the Light and Darkness know their periods of begin|ning and ending &amp;c. All have their hitherto and no further set by the Infinite, <HI>Eternal</HI> Arm, &amp; no further. But all the stars of hea|ven, the drops of the Ocean, the Sand on the Sea shore, the Leaves and Grass of the whole World are all too short to reach to the thought of one Minute of that which properly is Gods only propriety, <HI>to wit,</HI> Infinity.</P>
<P N="4">4. Among all the Opinions of the Souls Being and Rise, this of Infinity making it God himself, commits two horrible Mur|thers:</P>
<P>First,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two horrible Murthers, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></NOTE> It Murthers and destroys the Soul.</P>
<P>And Secondly, The Infinite God himself.</P>
<P>For the Soul of Man by such a world of woful experience being so subject to change, to sins and sorrows of all sorts. If this should be the Infinity of the Soul and so of God himself, there would be no Infinity at all so stopt, so limited by sins and sorrows:</P>
<P N="5">5. We use to say (hyperbollically) that such and such a doing is Infinite Pride, but surely it is wonderful and devilish lifting up of the mind of a poor Earthen Pot, though never so high, so wise, so learned, so holy to entertain thoughts of being the Eter|nal and boundless Infinite power and Godhead.</P>
<P>The blessed Lord proclaime his Infinite Power, his Infinite Wisdome, his Infinite Greatness, and Goodness, and Potience to poor sinners (as he did unto <HI>Job</HI> out of the Whirlwind) and then for all <HI>Jobs</HI> perfection and their own, (which so simply as well as proudly they prate of) they will with <HI>Job</HI> see cause to ab|hor themselves in Dust and Ashes.</P>
<P N="6">6. Such is the inconceivable Infinity in God beyond the reach of all Creatures, that he is not only Infinite but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">

<P N="7">7.

<P N="4">4.

<P>The holy Spirit, Christ and God are Authors of all these <HI>heavenly Gifts</HI> and <HI>Graces, the Beginner and Finisher of Faith,</HI> and therefore not <HI>Faith</HI> nor <HI>Hope,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Not the Spirit himself</NOTE> nor any other piece of the <HI>Ar|tillery</HI> themselves, no more then the <HI>Armorer</HI> is the <HI>Helmet,</HI> or the <HI>Cutler</HI> the <HI>Sword,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="6">6. In <HI>Revel. 1.</HI> Christ and the Sword with two Edges (which cometh forth of his mouth) are distinct, and can not be the same, as <HI>G.

<P N="7">7.

<P>I Reply, I have spoke before, that Spirits are <HI>Invisible Beings,</HI> both good and bad, Contrary to the <HI>Sadduces,</HI> who held neither.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Variety of Spirits.</NOTE> That, of good Spirits there are three sorts.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Increated</HI> God himself: 2. The Spirit of God called (because of his manifold operations) the seven Spirits of God, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Those <HI>Invisible, holy Messengers,</HI> or <HI>Angels,</HI> called <HI>Mini|string Spirits,</HI> and <HI>Flaming Attendants</HI> upon Christ and his, <HI>Heb:</HI> Opposite to these are the <HI>unclean Spirits</HI> spirits of Devils, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The Spirits of men, first, saints, as <HI>Mary</HI> sings, <HI>my Spirit hath re|joyced in God my Saviour,</HI> &amp;c. and opposite to these are the Spi|rits of the wicked as <HI>Peter</HI> tels us of the Spirits of the wicked, of the old world now in prison, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. I observe that in this <HI>Heb 12.</HI> the Spirit of God speaks not of the Bodies of the Saints neither Conjoynd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Why it is said the Spirits made perfect.</NOTE> nor a part. Nor secondly of the Righteous, made perfect, but the Spirits of First, the Righteous Therefore <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to hold forth not a perfect State of the Saints in this Life, Consulting of Spirits and Bodies,

which our proud Boasters say of themselves, nor that they are perfect: Nor secondly, of the Estate of the Saints in the world to come, where all <HI>true Protestants</HI> hold, that the Bodies and Souls of the Saints shall be perfected, and <HI>Everlastingly</HI>(and as to us now) <HI>Inconceivably glorified.</HI></P>
<P>But the Estate of the Souls or Spirits of the Elect, who are (as some Translate) perfected, some <HI>Consummated or finished,</HI> some grounded, or now ( <HI>Everlastingly Established,</HI> while their visi|ble part, <HI>the Body sleeps in Jesus</HI> until the <HI>joyful Resurrection.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Thus it appears the rather to be, because we find in all the <HI>holy Records</HI> the Spirits, Souls, and Bodies of the highest Saints in this world defective and subject to great failings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. It is said, <HI>1. Pet.3.</HI> the Spirits in prison, not the Bodies nor the wicked, but those Spirits of the wicked which believed not <HI>Noahs preaching,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
