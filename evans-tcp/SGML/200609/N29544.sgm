<HEAD>His Excellency, The Earl of BELLOMONT'S SPEECH TO THE General A&s;&s;embly of His Maje&s;ties Province, Conven'd at <HI>New-Hamp&s;hire</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> on Munday,
<DATE><HI>Augu&s;t</HI> 7. 1699.</DATE></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have Call'd you together at this time to give you an Op|portunity of Serving the Common Intere&s;t of your Country, by Redre&s;&s;ing the Grievances this Province lies under, and of making &s;uch Laws, as may by the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, E&s;ta|bli&s;h you in &s;afety and happine&s;s for the time to come.</P>
<P>I am very &s;en&s;ible of the great Sufferings you &s;u&s;tained all this la&s;t War, by this Province's being a Frontier towards the Ea&s;tern Indians, a cruel and perfidious Enemy in their own nature, but taught and incouraged to be more &s;o by the Je&s;uits, and other Popi&s;h Mi&s;&s;ionaries from <HI>France,</HI> who were not more indu&s;trious during the War, to in&s;tigate their Indian Di&s;ciples, and Pro&s;e|lytes (as they are pleas'd to call 'em) to Kill your people trea|cherou&s;ly, than they have been &s;ince the Peace, to debauch tho&s;e Indians from their former Subjection to the Crown of <HI>England</HI>: In&s;omuch as at pre&s;ent they &s;eem to have departed from their Allegiance to the Crown, and Revolted to the <HI>French.</HI> I have taken &s;uch mea&s;ures as quickly to find out whether tho&s;e In|dians will return to their Obedience to the Crown or no: if they do not, and that they Commit any Ho&s;tilities upon you; I doubt not but to find an ea&s;y way of &s;ubduing them.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="039348_0002_10141E80969CE508">Upon the Report of His Maje&s;ties Engineer, whom I &s;ent to view the Fort on the Great I&s;land, and the Harbour of this Town, I find the Scituation is naturally well di&s;pos'd, but the Fort &s;o very weak and untenable, that it requires the Building a new &s;ub&s;tantial one, to &s;ecure you in time of War. You will do well to take this matter into Con&s;ideration as &s;oon as may be. This Province is well Seated for Trade, and your Har|bour here on <HI>Pi&s;cataqua</HI> River &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> good that a Fort to &s;ecure it would invite people to come and &s;ettle among you, and as you grow in number, &s;o will your Trade advance and flou|ri&s;h: and you will be u&s;eful to <HI>England,</HI> which you ought to covet above all things, not only as it is your duty, but as it will al&s;o be for your Glory and Intere&s;t. Such a KING as GOD has ble&s;s'd us with at pre&s;ent, and &s;uch a Nation as that of <HI>England</HI> ought to excite in us a noble ambition to be reli|giou&s;ly faithful to the Fir&s;t, and zealou&s;ly &s;ub&s;ervient to the Intere&s;t of the Latter.</P>
<P>I Recommend to you Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Repre|&s;entatives, the providing for the nece&s;&s;ary Support of the Go|vernment, you being be&s;t able to judge what the Charge will be, and it belonging to you of right to provide the means to defray that Charge.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>You will do well to think of every thing that may conduce to your own happine&s;s and advantage <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 words"> you may depend <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> you, for I have all the di&s;po&s;ition imaginable to do the KING and this Country the be&s;t Service I am Capable of.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Ordered by the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, that His Excellency's Speech be Printed. <HI>Samuel Penhallow,</HI> Speaker.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
