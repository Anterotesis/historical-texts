<HEAD><HI>NARRATIVE,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>ON the 29th of March I was prevented from going on with my Character for the Evening, by a Part of the Audience calling for Mrs. <HI>Hallam,</HI> formerly an Actre&s;s in the Company, but who, for Rea&s;ons which will hereafter appear, was no longer under any En|gagements. Mrs. <HI>Hallam,</HI> contrary to the Regulations of the Theatre, and to an expre&s;s Article &s;igned by Mr. <HI>Hallam,</HI> came through the private Door into the Theatre, and, on the Stage, where &s;he was &s;upported by Mr. <HI>Hallam,</HI> a Performer and principal Proprietor of the Theatre, who addre&s;&s;ed the Audience, and obtained Permi&s;&s;ion for her to read a Paper intended for their hearing; the Purport of which was, a Complaint of having been <HI>driven</HI> unju&s;tly from the Stage, after having been ten Years on it, without any <HI>&s;ufficient</HI> Cau&s;e; intimating all this had been effected by my Agency. In the Confu&s;ion which followed, I was not allowed to ju&s;tify my&s;elf. After &s;ome Time, I &s;ubmitted, engaging to exculpate my&s;elf by a Publication in the Papers, or el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>THE Proceedings of this Evening, in Connection with what had pa&s;&s;ed in the Cour&s;e of the Winter, left no Room to doubt of Concert between &s;ome of the Spec|tators and Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Hallam.</HI></P>
<P>ON the 31&s;t, a &s;till larger Party attended the Repre|&s;entation at the Theatre, with an apparent Determination to prejudge and condem me. Marks of this Determi|nation were &s;o renew'd and repeated, that I thought it no longer po&s;&s;ible for me to continue on the Stage. It re|mains for me to fulfil my Engagement with the Public: For this Purpo&s;e I &s;hall exhibit a brief Narrative of my whole Connection with the American Theatres. The

Re&s;ult will &s;hew, that &s;o far from having conducted un|ju&s;tly towards Mrs. <HI>Hallam,</HI> and the Public, in Regard to her, that &s;he has been the Source of the principal Troubles which have ari&s;en: that my Conduct in this Re&s;pect, at lea&s;t, has been becoming my Situation, and that it is I, and not &s;he or Mr. <HI>Hallam,</HI> who have been injured on the pre&s;ent Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I was engaged from one of the fir&s;t Theatres in Eng|land, by the late Mr. <HI>John Henry,</HI> as a principal Per|former for the New-York and Philadelphia Theatres, and arrived in this Country September 5th, 1792. An Idea in&s;tilled into me, that every Article of Life was full as cheap again here as there, made me accept a more moderate Salary than I &s;hould have done, had I been rightly informed. I was to remain for two Years and &s;ix Months, at three Guineas and a Half weekly; to be &s;ecured to me for ten Months in the Year. This Con|tract I fulfilled on my Part, though violated in &s;everal In&s;tances by the Managers, <HI>Hallam</HI> and <HI>Henry,</HI> and eleven Weeks of Salary due at this Hour to me and my Family from them, on my original Agreements.</P>
<P>I found the Theatre under Regulations widely dif|ferent from my Expectations; the Managers and their Families did not know each other out of the Profe&s;&s;ion; and when they met in it, their whole Study &s;eemed to be the &s;owing Di&s;&s;entions and creating different Intere&s;ts &mdash;a Sy&s;tem of Government avowed and recommended by Mr. <HI>Hallam.</HI> The Con&s;equence of this was <HI>Neg|ligence, Party,</HI> and <HI>Strife.</HI> I &s;oon was given to under|&s;tand that this had <HI>always</HI> been the Ca&s;e. Mr. <HI>Henry</HI>'s Conduct and Behaviour &s;eemed &s;o different from the Gentleman, I had conver&s;ed with in England, that I could not avoid forming Prejudices again&s;t him, and in favour of <HI>Hallam.</HI> This Mr. <HI>Henry</HI> &s;aw, and took an Opportunity of telling me I misjudg'd him; and that Mr. <HI>Hallam,</HI> though appearing perfectly mild and can|did, &s;ecretly gave him every Di&s;quiet and Mi&s;ery, and had utterly broke his Temper. The Want of Unani|mity

at <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> to a total Subver&s;ion of all Order: Pieces were given out, and no Manager attended to point a &s;ingle Direction. The Orche&s;tra was compo&s;ed of about &s;ix Mu&s;icians, &s;ome of whom were incapable of their Bu&s;ine&s;s, and had I not been induced by Con&s;ider|ations for my own Reputation as an Actor, to take Care that the Stage Department was not totally de&s;troyed where I was concern'd, this neglect would have been more apparent than it was! Notwith&s;tanding my Exertions, the Theatre was nearly de&s;erted. Mr. <HI>Henry</HI> &s;aid he could not exi&s;t under &s;uch Torment longer, and offered to &s;ell his Share of the Property. I urged Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> to negotiate for it, and offered to become a Purcha&s;er after|ward from him, and that I would undertake the conduct|ing of the Theatre. The Terms of Sale were left for Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> to arrange with a Friend of Mr. <HI>Henry</HI>'s; and at this Period I &s;aw a Letter of his, reque&s;ting a &s;peedy End to the Bu&s;ine&s;s; for that, &s;ooner than be concerned any longer where Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> was, he would tran&s;port him&s;elf to Botany Bay. I deemed this the Effect of violent Anger or Prejudice, and &s;uffered it to make no Impre&s;&s;ion on my Mind at the Time.</P>
<P>IN the Month of May, 1794, Mr. <HI>Henry</HI> &s;old to Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> all his Share of the theatrical Property within the United States of America, for &pound; 4000, payable by four annual In&s;talments of &pound; 1000 each.</P>
<P>IN the &s;ame Month, I purcha&s;ed from <HI>Lewis Hallam</HI> one Half the Property of the Old American Company within the United States, for &pound; 4000, payable by four annual In&s;talments of &pound; 1000 each.</P>
<P>DURING the Summer, I endeavoured to make &s;uch Ad|ditions to the Company as were nece&s;&s;ary; and on the 22d of September commenced my unfortunate Career as a Manager and Proprietor in the City of Philadelphia. On the 20th October, Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> performed Lady Rackett, in too degraded a State to be &s;een; and on ob&s;erving that &s;ome of the Ladies of the Theatre noticed her Situation, gave them ill Language, and fini&s;hed with this Expre&s;&s;ion &mdash;"Wretches that I &s;upport by my Labours!"</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="032263_0005_0FF1AEF6D374C620">ON the 27th of October, in a violent Fit of Intem|perance, Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> was quarreling with Mr. <HI>A&s;hton,</HI> a Member of the Company; and as the Performance of "Wild Oats," was then proceeding, I mildly interfered, and begged her for the Pre&s;ent to treat whatever the Matter was as not worth her Notice. She immediately commenced a &s;train of Invective and Abu&s;e, &s;uch as I had never heard, or ever did expect to hear, from the Mouth of a Female <HI>Ra&s;cal! Scoundrel! Swindler</HI> of her Hu&s;band's Property! and other Epithets equally unju&s;t, for two Hours was I baited with; and during the Per|formance of the After-piece, "Don Juan," every Mock and Ridicule that could be was ca&s;t on my Endeavours to conduct &s;o trouble&s;ome a Pantomime to its Clo&s;e. Some of the Performers then with us, &s;till remain.</P>
<P>ON the Morning of the 28th, I wrote Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> a Letter to the following Effect: "That having taken twelve Hours to pau&s;e on the unmerited Treatment I had received, I mu&s;t beg to decline any further official Capacity in the Old American Company: ob&s;erving, that the Property had been &s;o little a Time in my Hands; Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> could receive no Inconveniency by accept|ing it back on the &s;ame Terms I had purcha&s;ed; that I had no Wi&s;h to di&s;tre&s;s him by an immediate Re|moval, but would &s;tay with him upon the Fulfilment of my original Engagements to the Expiration of them, or the conclu&s;ion of the following York Sea&s;on." To this Letter Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> wrote the following:

<P>I want as u&s;ual, to the Theatre, to conduct the Re|hear&s;al, and in &s;ome little Time after my Arrival there <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> a Me&s;&s;age from Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI>&mdash;that &s;he was at my <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to &s;ee me.

I was at the Theatre, and could not attend Mrs. <HI>Hallam.</HI> She &s;ent my Servant back to &s;ay &s;he mu&s;t &s;ee me, and that if I would not wait on her then, &s;he would remain till I &s;hould come Home. I determined on &s;eeing her: She began with Tears, a very &s;trong Apology for her Con|duct, and &s;aid &s;he was utterly ruined with Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> if I per&s;i&s;ted in re&s;igning the Property. I a&s;ked her if &s;he remembered the Events of the preceding Evening? She replied, &s;he had no Recollection of them, and that my Letter to her Hu&s;band was a Thunderbolt to her. I repeated the Epithets &s;he had made u&s;e of, and &s;he <HI>&s;eemed</HI> very much &s;hock'd. She begged my forgetfulne&s;s of the pa&s;t, &s;olemnly a&s;&s;erting &s;he &s;hould look upon her&s;elf as the verie&s;t Wretch exi&s;ting, &s;hould &s;he ever, by &s;imilar Imprudence, ri&s;k a future Mi&s;under&s;tanding. I forgave her &s;incerely, and we parted. I dined the &s;ame Day at a Tavern, with Mr. <HI>Hallam,</HI> according to his Appoint|ment, who &s;eemed, and I believe was mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly affect|ed, and I recollect made u&s;e of the following Expre&s;&s;ion:
<Q>I know that Girl &s;o well, I'm &s;ure &s;he never will for|give her&s;elf, or drink any Thing but Water as long as &s;he lives.</Q>
I told Mr. <HI>Hallam,</HI> it was a Failing that, if not put an effectual Stop to, would de&s;troy every Po&s;|&s;ibility of my Continuance in the Company, or Manage|ment. I proceeded, as u&s;ual, in my Capacity of Acting-Manager, and on the 14th of November &s;he was again intemperate and abu&s;ive when performing Lady Fan|court, in the Comedy of "Love's Frailties." My Wife al&s;o now began to feel the Effects of her Pride, and was frequently treated with every Contempt. I clo&s;ed that Theatre on the 4th of December, after ten Weeks of woeful managerial Experience.</P>
<P>I commenced in New-York, December 15th, and on the 20th Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> was again in a State which incapacitated her for performing Mi&s;s Wal&s;ingham, in the "School for Wives," in a &s;uitable Manner. On the 29th &s;he was con&s;iderably wor&s;e in the Character of Marianne, in the "Dramati&s;t." On the 5th of January,

1795, we performed "Percy," and in the Fight with Douglas, I, by Accident, cut Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI>'s Hand: Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> came behind the Scenes in a violent Rage, and on being a&s;ked what had di&s;turbed her, replied, "Why! that damn'd Butcher has cut Mr. <HI>Hallam!</HI>" On the 6th of January, I wrote Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> the following Letter:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ON &s;o di&s;agreeable a Bu&s;ine&s;s, as it is my Duty to come to a perfect Explanation with you, I was in hope I might gain an Opportunity of per&s;onal Remon|&s;trance: But no&mdash;you &s;eem to &s;hun me! I had adopted a certainty that after the very unmerited and illiberal Language heaped on my by Mrs. <HI>Hallam,</HI> in Philadelphia, and her &s;olemn Oath, I never &s;hould hear a Repetition, it would have cea&s;ed. Why, Sir, am I &s;o frequently the Cau&s;e of her pre&s;ent Vengeance? And why do you not take Mea&s;ures to prevent &s;uch Conduct? Is it becau&s;e every Moment of my Life is dedicated to promoting our mutual Intere&s;t? Is it be|cau&s;e I am ince&s;&s;antly &s;tudying to make the Theatre re&s;pectable, and increa&s;e your Welfare and Pro&s;perity? Why, Sir, la&s;t Night, for an Accident of trivial Na|ture, had I the very delicate Term of <HI>Butcher</HI> applied to me? And why, a few Evenings back again, that of <HI>Swindler</HI> and <HI>Ra&s;cal?</HI> Good God, Sir, if either have a Claim on the other for Gratitude, I think it is due from you, and that your Property by this Time, had I not &s;tepped in and prop'd it, would have fallen to the Ground. It becomes no Plea to a&s;&s;ert that <HI>Rea&s;on</HI> has no Share in the&s;e Declarations: They are private Sentiments, which Rea&s;on &s;moothers, and that bani&s;h'd, the Soul is thrown open undi&s;gui&s;ed. I feel your Situation, Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI>: I am cut to the Heart to &s;ee it, but I cannot, will not, remain indif|ferent to my own. My Wife, Sir, is not permitted nor does &s;he endeavour or wi&s;h to know more of Bu|&s;ine&s;s

than I ca&s;ually communicate; and as I cannot compliment Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> with a better Head than my own, I dont think &s;he can fairly judge my Actions, and I am certain you <HI>ought</HI> not to permit her; at any Rate I <HI>will</HI> not; and I think it but hone&s;t to inform you, the next Time I hear <HI>her</HI> make U&s;e of my Name unde&s;ervedly, I will immediately throw up the Bu&s;ine&s;s, and call the Public as an Umpire between us. Let Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> vent illiberal Language on her Dependants, if &s;he mu&s;t u&s;e it; I am <HI>none:</HI> And as to the Property which &s;he is weak enough to imagine &s;o infallible, I would rather give it up than have another Hour's concern where &s;he is or will be a Meddler.&mdash; Sir, we are a City Talk; and it would certainly be better to endeavour that Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> &s;hould be kept at Home, than &s;uffered to expo&s;e us and her&s;elf, when &s;o unfit to be &s;een. I know, Sir, I am &s;peaking in plain Terms; I think it my Duty to do &s;o.

<P><PB N="10" REF="032263_0009_0FF1AF0133E27498">THIS Letter I received no An&s;wer to, but was in|formed Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> &s;eemed much concerned on peru&s;ing it. On the 10th of January, Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> (again in a State of partial Intoxication) performed Lady Eu&s;ton, in "I'll tell you What." On the 28th equally &s;o in the Marchione&s;s Merida, "Child of Nature." On the 25th February, I brought forward the Comedy of the "<HI>Jew,</HI>" for the fir&s;t Time in this Theatre; and in the elegant cha&s;te Character of Eliza Ratcliffe, the Audience witne&s;&s;ed an Exhibition too di&s;gu&s;tful to remember, and too di&s;graceful to the Stage to be dwelt upon. The general Cry &s;eemed to be&mdash;"She mu&s;t in&s;ult us no more!" I informed Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> of this, in Company with a Gentleman who has been long his Friend, and both our Opinions were, that if Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> ri&s;ked ano|ther Appearance, the People would &s;hew their Re&s;ent|ment. Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> determined on withdrawing her, and begged from me the di&s;agreeable Office of communicat|ing to her the Re&s;olution. I undertook this, and a Scene &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, &s;o harra&s;&s;ing to the Feelings, I &s;carce ever did witne&s;s, and hope never may again. She was from before the Public one Month, and the The|atre progre&s;&s;ed with every po&s;&s;ible Harmony and Credit. During this Time, a Report was indu&s;triou&s;ly circulated that Laudanum was the Cau&s;e of Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI>'s frequent Incapability. The Public Voice turned, and there was a Wi&s;h to &s;ee her again. Convinced, <HI>whatever was the Cau&s;e,</HI> it would be her Study in future to avoid that <HI>particu|lar</HI> Thing, which brought her Weakne&s;s before the Public Eye, I took Advantage of this Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and told Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> I was certain, if &s;he appeared, &s;he would be greatly received. I did this becau&s;e I felt Conviction her late Mortification mu&s;t have been a &s;trong Monitor, and po&s;&s;ibly a Reformation mu&s;t en&s;ue, both in Conduct behind the Scenes and on the Stage. On the 25th of March &s;he rea&s;&s;umed her Profe&s;&s;ion in Lady Teazle. The &s;econd Character &s;he repre&s;ented was Cordelia, March 30th, in which &s;he was not perfectly her&s;elf. On
<PB N="11" REF="032263_0010_0FF1AF0469920760">
the 10th of April &s;he performed Loui&s;a, in the "World in a Village," and &s;everal People in Di&s;gu&s;t left the Theatre. On the 11th of May &s;he performed Mi&s;s Ne|ville, in "Know your own Mind," a Comedy got up by me, about a Fortnight before, for Mrs. <HI>Hodgkin&s;on</HI>'s Benefit. My Wife dre&s;&s;ed in the &s;ame Room, and a little Time after Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI>'s Arrival, &s;he commenced her abu&s;e of me, and of the Character &s;he was going to repre&s;ent; and, looking in my Wife's Face, cried, "Damn the Play; damn the Per&s;on who got it up, and damn the Per&s;on for whom it <HI>was</HI> got up." The next Day I reque&s;ted Mrs. <HI>Hodgkin&s;on</HI> to quit that Room. I then wrote to Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> the following Letter:
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have delayed, till Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI>'s Benefit was pa&s;t, communicating my Determination on our future Con|nection. After the mo&s;t minute Inve&s;tigation on the Po&s;&s;ibility of Friend&s;hip or Harmony exi&s;ting, I find none. There are Ob&s;tacles in&s;urmountable. I have combated them in Hope; I have borne them from &s;incere Attachment. When I became a Partner in this Theatre, it was not with the Hope of bettering my Situation: It was to make it permanent; it was to &s;upport, as far as I could, <HI>you</HI>; becau&s;e I conceived you injured and oppre&s;&s;ed by your former Connection. My Opinion now is, that whatever might have been Mr. <HI>Henry</HI>'s other Failings, he &s;aw you your own Enemy, and was convinced an unworthy Influence made you other People's. I will not dwell on what, with me, is fix'd as Fate: We mu&s;t &s;eparate. I am anxious to regain that Peace which as a private Indivi|dual no Man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in a higher Degree. I wi&s;h to re&s;ign the Management. If you will not take the Property on the Valuation of three unprejudiced Per|&s;ons, I will certainly adverti&s;e my Share to the highe&s;t Bidder.

<P>ON Monday, May 18th, the Comedy of "Which is the Man?" was performed; and the Hair-Dre&s;&s;er who attended Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> came to my Room to &s;ay that it was impo&s;&s;ible for her to go on the Stage that Night, for &s;he was &s;o &s;en&s;ele&s;s &s;he could not &s;it in her Chair! It was a Benefit, and therefore the Audience could not well be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. When the Hour of com|mencing arrived, I was reque&s;ted, three &s;everal Times, to delay the Performance, while &s;he had Vinegar and &s;trong Green Tea given, to re&s;tore her as much as po&s;&s;i|ble. When &s;he did come forward, let tho&s;e who wit|ne&s;&s;ed the Spectacle declare the Shame of it.</P>
<P>I had &s;oon after a Meeting with Mr. <HI>Hallam,</HI> at the Hou&s;e of one of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable Characters in this City; and two other Gentlemen, as mutual Friends, attended to give their Advice. I &s;tated my Grievances plainly before them, and they uniformly agreed it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to remain any longer in the Theatre if Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> did; and one of them ob&s;erved,&mdash;
<Q>Mr. <HI>Hallam,</HI> I have heretofore been anxious to &s;uppre&s;s and do away Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI>'s Misfortune, as a Calum|ny; but, Sir, I was pre&s;ent at the Repre&s;entation of <HI>Which is the Man?</HI> and when I &s;aw her come on the Stage, I immediately left the Hou&s;e; and had any one plunged a Sword through my Heart, it could not have given me a keener Pang than I felt at that Mo|ment.</Q>
Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> &s;aid he had no Reply to make&punc; he could not deny any Thing I had a&s;&s;erted, and that he knew my Situation to be dreadful! I offered him, once

This he declined, and promi&s;ed, before the Gentlemen who had intere&s;ted them&s;elves, to withdraw Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> from the Stage totally at the Conclu&s;ion of the Sea&s;on; commi&s;&s;ioning me, at the &s;ame Time, to procure an Actre&s;s in her Place from England. I wrote, by the earlie&s;t Ve&s;&s;el, for Mrs. <HI>John&s;on,</HI> and &s;he arrived here on the fir&s;t of October following. The Calamity that afflicted this City in the Autumn of 1795 compelled us to make a Treaty for the Bo&s;ton Theatre; and I was not a little &s;urpri&s;ed, while in Hartford, to hear that Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> had returned to the Stage, and was performing at Providence, with Mr. <HI>Hallam.</HI> Some few Days after our arrival in Bo&s;ton, Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> waited on me, to &s;ay, that he &s;hould make his fir&s;t E&s;&s;ay before that Audience in Lord Ogleby, and that Mrs. <HI>Hallam mu&s;t</HI> perform the Character of Mi&s;s Sterling! I made no Reply; I was too much a&s;toni&s;hed! I parted with him to reflect on what had pa&s;&s;ed. I made Enquiries of the Performers re&s;pecting Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI>'s Conduct at Providence. They were all agreed it had, if po&s;&s;ible, been wor&s;e than ever. I felt &s;hock'd at Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI>'s Duplicity: a manife&s;t Vio|lation of his Word, without even an Attempt at Apolo|gy; without any Rea&s;on but "it mu&s;t be &s;o!" Entire Strangers, as we were, a Mi&s;under&s;tanding, immediately on our Appearance before the Public, would have been Ruin. I &s;ubmitted in Silence. In the mean Time I &s;tood highly implicated to Mrs. <HI>John&s;on</HI>&punc; who had come three thou&s;and Miles to &s;upply a Line of Characters Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI>'s In&s;incerity would deprive her of. Mrs. <HI>John|&s;on,</HI> however, with the greate&s;t Genero&s;ity, in Part re|lieved me, by &s;aying that Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> might retain all the Characters &s;he <HI>had</HI> performed: but that, in the Ar|rangement of new Pieces, &s;he &s;hould expect her Engage|ment fulfilled, by being given the elegant Characters in Comedy. This I not only promi&s;ed, but &s;tood pledged to. My Situation as Manager now became more irk|&s;ome than ever. Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> quarrelled with me becau&s;e
<PB N="14" REF="032263_0013_0FF1AF0ECA980D28">
he did not perform many of the young, Fir&s;t Rate Cha|racters, which he &s;aid he had &s;upplied &s;ince his fir&s;t Ar|rival in America, and that he had not re&s;igned them, nor ever would. Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> poured on me every odious Epithet that Intemperance could &s;ugge&s;t. An Opportu|nity offered of relea&s;ing my&s;elf from this Mi&s;ery, by an Offer of Connection with the Bo&s;ton Theatre; but, after &s;ome Reflection, my Re&s;pect for the Patronage I had experienced from the Citizens of New-York determined me on not accepting it. Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> was taken ill, and I felt &s;ome Alarm, that as yet he had never conveyed my Share of the Property to me, though I had frequently &s;o|licited to have it done, and had paid a Part of the Pur|cha&s;e Money. He recovered, and I again applied. He begged it might be po&s;tponed till our Arrival in New-York. I agreed reluctantly. When we <HI>did</HI> arrive in New-York, I repeated my Reque&s;t. I was not &s;ucce&s;s|ful, till, finally, I &s;ent Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> Word I would not enter the Theatre till the Deeds were executed. I got legal Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion la&s;t March, 22 Months after the Pur|cha&s;e had been made. I think it but Ju&s;tice to declare, that I was <HI>informed</HI> this Conduct was not Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI>'s Will, but that Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> could not be prevailed on to &s;ign. I had frequently conver&s;ed with Mr. <HI>Dunlap,</HI> re|&s;pecting my Situation, and the Torture I laboured un|der; and as I knew him to be attached to the Theatre, in one of our Conver&s;ations, I offered to &s;ell him Half my Share, if he would undertake the Acting Manage|ment; for that I had more Labour than the Mind or Body could po&s;&s;ibly &s;u&s;tain. I had applied to Mr. <HI>Hallam,</HI> to know what he meant to allow me for my ex|traordinary Fatigue, and he had peremptorily refu&s;ed any Compen&s;ation; which I thought hard, becau&s;e, on the fir&s;t Commencement of Theatrical Bu&s;ine&s;s after our Partner&s;hip, we had paid a Gentleman <HI>One Hundred Pounds</HI> for acting as Trea&s;urer and Book-keeper only ten Weeks. And here I hope it will not be deemed an un|nece&s;&s;ary Digre&s;&s;ion, if I mention what my Situation
<PB N="15" REF="032263_0014_0FF1AF11FB543F68">
exactly was. I had to ca&s;t and arrange the Bu&s;ine&s;s of every Play brought forward. I had the various Tem|pers, Rival&s;hips, and Ambitions of thirty or forty Peo|ple to encounter and plea&s;e. I kept all the Accounts; I made all Di&s;bur&s;ements, and was made, in all Money Tran&s;actions, &s;olely re&s;pon&s;ible. My profe&s;&s;ional La|bours were extreme, and I never fini&s;hed them for the Evening that I did not attend to take the State of each Night's Receipts. Nay, in&s;tead of enjoying my com|fortable Hour of &s;ocial Intercour&s;e with my Family, on my Arrival Home, I had a Check Account to take, and to make the regular Entries in my Books. I wrote and corrected every Play-Bill for the Printer. I planned and copied every Scene-Plot for the Carpenter. I attended every Rehear&s;al, to give Directions. I went through a varied and exten&s;ive Line of Characters on the Stage. I found principally my own Wardrobe for them; and my Salary, for all this, was twenty Dollars per Week, paid only when we performed! Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> received the &s;ame, and had no Share in the Fatigue. His An&s;wer to me, on Application to know what he would allow me, was, that "he would quit the Theatre the Moment any Man received a Shilling more than him." An idea exceed|ingly unju&s;t; for at the Time of his Purcha&s;e from <HI>John Henry,</HI> the Shares were, Mr. <HI>Henry</HI> Four and a Half, Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> Three and a Half; and when Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> agreed with me, he re&s;erved the Difference: for the whole Property being equally divided between us, Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> gained a Sixteenth; as he paid Mr. <HI>Henry</HI> no more for Four and a Half Shares, than I did him (Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI>) for Four Shares.</P>
<P>To return to my Narrative: Mr. <HI>Dunlap</HI> &s;eemed in|clined to treat with me, and finally was introduced, as Acting Manager, into the Theatre, with the Concur|rence of Mr. <HI>Hallam,</HI> and to receive my A&s;&s;i&s;tance. I flattered my&s;elf I was now &s;ome little Di&s;tance removed from my Di&s;quiets; but I was di&s;appointed. Mr. <HI>Dunlap</HI>'s
<PB N="16" REF="032263_0015_0FF1AF152E0FCF20">
Inexperience compell'd me &s;till to be the Director in the Stage Department, according to Agreement, and I never gave an Order in Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI>'s hearing that &s;he did not pointedly ridicule and in&s;ult me. My Wife never pa&s;s'd her, that &s;he was not treated with every Mark of Con|tempt; and tho&s;e who may lack Information on this Part, or labor under a different Impre&s;&s;ion, I here inform, that &s;he never made one Word of Reply. I now ac|quainted Mr. <HI>Dunlap,</HI> it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to &s;tay and perform my Agreements with him; and a very, very irk&s;ome and di&s;agreeable Corre&s;pondence took Place, between us in Con&s;equence: I offer'd to &s;ell him the remaining Share I held, or to put it into his Hands as a Tru&s;t and Security, that he &s;hould not be a Lo&s;er by my Ab&s;ence: He accepted the latter, and I wrote to the Philadelphia Managers my Re&s;olution, and of my Wi&s;h to gain a Situation in their Theatre. They, I pre&s;ume, thought my Services of &s;ome Value for both arriv'd Po&s;t here, and convers'd per&s;onally with me on the Bu&s;ine&s;s. I a&s;ked my Terms, and to their Honor let me thus publicly declare, I never did experience in any Negociation more Candor and Liberality; and had I left New-York, their Acquie&s;cence in my Demands mu&s;t have prov'd to me and my Family infinitely more valua|ble than any Thing I ever did, or probably may hereafter attain. About this Time Mr. <HI>Dunlap</HI> waited on me, to &s;ay, that if I could not remain in the Company, and per|form my fir&s;t Contracts with him, he mu&s;t relinqui&s;h his Purcha&s;e, tho' &s;ubjected to very great Lo&s;s and Incon|venience thereby: He al&s;o informed me, he had <HI>written Mr.</HI> Hallam, <HI>that Mrs.</HI> Hallam<HI>'s Continuance in the Theatre was an in&s;uperable Objection to his making any Arrangement with him.</HI> I replied, I <HI>could</HI> not&mdash;I <HI>would</HI> not &s;tay; and that I preferr'd retiring peaceably, to waging open Controver&s;y with Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI>; who, in my Opinion, from his long Services, had an unque&s;tionable prior Right to his Situation:&mdash;that I felt the Injuries of Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> and his Family forcibly; but that I was
<PB N="17" REF="032263_0016_0FF1AF16CB80EA70">
better able to provide for, and bear the Evils of Separa|tion, than he was, and I would not retaliate. I relin|qui&s;h'd the Sale I had made to Mr. <HI>Dunlap,</HI> and he quitted the Bu&s;ine&s;s. On the 17th of June la&s;t, I wrote Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> the following Letter:

<P>Mr. <HI>Philip Ten Eyck,</HI> was kind enough to bear this Let|ter; and &s;ome Time after I met him in Broadway, when I was in Company with an Agent, who had arriv'd from Philadelphia to complete my Engagements for that City: I enquir'd Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI>'s Determination, and was told he wi&s;hed &s;ome Days for Con&s;ideration. I inform'd Mr. <HI>Ten Eyck,</HI> that my peculiar Situation requir'd an An&s;wer on the following Morning; and that I could not wait longer than that Period. I urg'd Mr. <HI>Ten Eyck</HI> to return to Mr. <HI>Hallam,</HI> and he did &s;o: Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> then pro|mi&s;ed a definitive An&s;wer by Mr. <HI>Ten Eyck</HI> the next Day. At the appointed Hour&punc; Mr. <HI>Ten Eyck</HI> waited on me, and found at my Hou&s;e Mr. <HI>Dunlap,</HI> and the Agent from Philadelphia. Mr. <HI>Ten Eyck</HI> ob&s;erved, that Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> had commi&s;&s;ioned him to &s;ay, that
<Q>he knew the Cau&s;e of our Differences, but they &s;hould cea&s;e; for he would withdraw Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> from the Stage, which he pre&s;umed would reconcile the Whole.</Q>
I an|&s;wered Mr. <HI>Ten Eyck,</HI> that it would not; that Mrs. <HI>Hal|lam</HI>'s being withdrawn was no Stipulation of mine; for as Mr. <HI>Hallam,</HI> had once before openly broke his Word with me on that Score, I had thought it needle&s;s to men|tion as a Difficulty, what if promis'd to be remov'd, would not be long maintained: That Mr. <HI>Dunlap,</HI> I believed, had quitted the Theatre, upon finding it im|po&s;&s;ible
<PB N="19" REF="032263_0018_0FF1AF1A18ED87E0">
to conduct it with Propriety, if Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> continued, and had written Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> a Letter to that Effect: That Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI>'s la&s;t Difficulty with me was, his having laid Claim to many of the mo&s;t principal and youthful Characters in the Drama, which I thought he had re&s;igned long ago, &s;uch as Hamlet, Ranger, Zanga, Ore&s;tes, Benedick, Don John, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> and his informing Mr. <HI>Dunlap</HI> that I had injured him, by not giving him out for them; but that now he expected them to be brought forward; and that all that I wanted from Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> now, was an An&s;wer re&s;pecting my Propo&s;al of our Property. Mr. <HI>Ten Eyck</HI> ob&s;erved, he was no Way privileged to &s;peak on that, as he had &s;up|po&s;ed Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> the great Objection. I replied, &s;he was &s;o; but remarked again, I had conceived no U&s;e in mentioning an Impo&s;&s;ibility. Mr. <HI>Ten Eyck</HI> reque&s;ted Mr. <HI>Dunlap</HI> to accompany him to Mr. <HI>Hallam:</HI> They went together, and, &s;ome Time after, Mr. <HI>Dunlap</HI> re|turned, with Information, that Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> was not only willing to take Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> from the Stage, but to leave the ca&s;ting of all Pieces to his (<HI>Dunlap</HI>'s) Judgment; and that he was willing to enter <HI>into Contracts,</HI> with <HI>any Penalty,</HI> for the Performance of what &s;hould be agreed on, as the be&s;t Mode to &s;ecure our future Peace. I ob|&s;erved, that, wearied by my repeated Di&s;appointments, I wi&s;hed no further Connection with Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI>; and that I conceived I had proceeded too far in my Philadelphia Engagement to honourably recede. Mr. <HI>Dunlap</HI> dif|fered with me in this, and remarked, that he had quit|ted a Bu&s;ine&s;s, in Part, to purcha&s;e my Property; and that he mu&s;t inevitably experience great Lo&s;s by my De|parture: That while he &s;aw no Pro&s;pect of my Griev|ances being redre&s;&s;ed, he was content to &s;ubmit; but, now that there was a Certainty of their being remedied, he mu&s;t in Duty call on me to fulfil my Engagements wih him, or that he &s;hould be compelled to &s;eek for Re&s;titution in &s;ome other Way. Finally, I broke off my Philadelphia Negociation, and concluded to remain
<PB N="20" REF="032263_0019_0FF1AEECE3DF6150">
once more. Contracts were ordered to be drawn up; and I inquired of Mr. <HI>Dunlap,</HI> if Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI>'s Name was to be in&s;erted? He replied, it would be more deli|cate to omit her Name, as they could be made equally forcible, without mentioning <HI>her.</HI> I applauded the Idea. The following are the Articles, which Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> had three Days in his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, previous to &s;igning; and they were made to extend to <HI>Two Years, at his own Reque&s;t</HI></P>

<P>ABOUT the 14th of February, Mr. <HI>Dunlap</HI> informed me that he had waited on Mr. <HI>Hallam,</HI> having reque&s;ted a Gentleman to witne&s;s the Conver&s;ation; when Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> confirmed the above Determination; and, on being reminded of his Engagements, &s;aid, "I did tell Mr. <HI>Ten Eyck</HI> that I would withdraw Mrs. <HI>Hallam,&mdash;but I did not &s;ay for how long</HI>:" That he told Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> that he &s;hould con&s;ider his Attempt to force Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> on the Stage as a Violation of the Articles; and was an|&s;wered, <HI>he might</HI> THINK <HI>as he plea&s;ed:</HI> That he told Mr. <HI>Hallam,</HI> that if there was any Di&s;turbance in the The|atre, on Account of Mrs. <HI>Hallam,</HI> after the Avowal that &s;he had waited upon a Number of Ladies, who had e&s;pou&s;ed her Quarrel, he &s;hould con&s;ider him <HI>(Hallam)</HI> as the Cau&s;e; and was an&s;wered, <HI>he might</HI> THINK <HI>as he plea&s;ed:</HI> That on &s;aying he <HI>(Dunlap)</HI> mu&s;t take Mea|&s;ures for the Security of his Property, he was an&s;wered, <HI>he might</HI> DO <HI>as he plea&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>FINDING that the Di&s;&s;atisfactions of Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> con|tinued; hearing that he intended to introduce his Wife on the Stage, during the Benefits; and convinced that the Di&s;&s;olution of the Company mu&s;t be the Con&s;e|quence, to the great Injury of the Performers, as well as of the Proprietors; I determined, with the Concur|rence of Mr. <HI>Dunlap,</HI> and the Advice of Gentlemen whom I &s;uppo&s;ed Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI>'s Friends, to make him

Propo&s;als that might prevent Violence, and terminate all Differences to his Satisfaction. Many Modes were premi&s;ed by the&s;e Friends, and they can vouch I did not, I would not li&s;ten to any, that had not for its End the <HI>future Comfort and Independence of Mr. Hallam.</HI>&mdash; With this View the following Letter was &s;ent to him:

<P><PB N="26" REF="032263_0025_0FF1AF31B50C7990">ON the Monday Evening following, Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> came into my Dre&s;&s;ing-Room, and told me he did not chu&s;e to comply with tho&s;e Rules. I told him I was &s;orry to hear it, and that I &s;uppo&s;ed he could not violate them, without violating al&s;o the Contracts that exi&s;ted between us! He replied, he cho&s;e to violate them, and that he had torn them down, and &s;et us at Defiance.</P>
<P>THE Wedne&s;day following, the Tran&s;action took Place which I have briefly &s;tated as the Motive for this Narrative, in which I tru&s;t it will appear,&mdash;1&s;t, That, by Articles entered into voluntarily by Mr. <HI>Hallam,</HI> the Purport of which was known to him, and to which he was explicitly advi&s;ed by his Friends, Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> had no Right to come on the Stage, or Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> to demand it: &mdash;2d, That Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> had not been withdrawn by any Stipulation of mine, at the Time of the pre&s;ent Agree|ment; but by Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI>'s own free Offer and apparent Conviction, that her Conduct had made it improper for her to remain before the Public, and impo&s;&s;ible for a re&s;pectable Stage to be where &s;he was a Performer:&mdash; 3d, That Mr. <HI>Hallam,</HI> in favouring the Attempt to re|produce Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> on the Stage, and in attempting him&s;elf to introduce her; as well as by tearing down the Regulations of the Acting-Manager; has not only vio|lated his Contracts, but treated the Public with Di&s;re|&s;pect, and the other Proprietors with Inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>IN Regard to the Proceedings of the 29th and 31&s;t of March, I can only ob&s;erve, the Prejudice and Mi&s;repre|&s;entation that unhappily prevailed, have compelled me to the <HI>mo&s;t painful and irk&s;ome</HI> Mode of ju&s;tifying my&s;elf&mdash; that of expo&s;ing <HI>many</HI> Tran&s;actions, to public View, which none but the Parties concerned ever ought to have been made acquainted with, or intere&s;ted in; and I tru&s;t my prior Determinations of quitting my Situation, rather than make this Expo&s;ure, will convince every Reader, the Differences &s;tated would never have been known thro' me, had not every Means been tried to render my Conduct completely odious to the Parties who came
<PB N="27" REF="032263_0026_0FF1AF3361C7F300">
forward on this Occa&s;ion, that <HI>Calumny</HI> could &s;ugge&s;t. I have been made <HI>accountable</HI> for an Action I was not concerned in, or in my Power &s;olely to remedy! as a &s;econd Peru&s;al of our Contracts will <HI>convince.</HI> It has been al&s;o a&s;&s;erted, that Mr. <HI>Hallam</HI> only <HI>applied</HI> to have Mrs. <HI>Hallam</HI> perform at his Benefit: This is not a Fact.&mdash; Mr. HALLAM <HI>has never</HI> made <HI>any</HI> Application, but that to Mr. <HI>Dunlap,</HI> in which he &s;tated Mrs. HALLAM <HI>ought to be engaged in the Company!</HI> His Son applied on his own account, but Mr. <HI>Hallam,</HI> &s;en, was never mentioned.</P>
<P>I beg Leave al&s;o further to remark, that the Situation I was placed in was &s;o peculiarly trying, none but an Actor, or a Per&s;on who has made him&s;elf re&s;pon&s;ible for a <HI>well regulated Entertainment,</HI> can po&s;&s;ibly feel or judge.</P>
<P>I was received, for the fir&s;t Time in my Life, with pointed di&s;approbation, before I could even &s;peak. A Per&s;on who had no Connection with the Stage, who&s;e own Faults had de&s;ervedly bani&s;hed her from it&mdash;was called for&mdash;was &s;ecreted, ready to bur&s;t forward&mdash;was protected&mdash;&s;upported by her own Hu&s;band, in direct Violation of his mo&s;t &s;olemn Contracts&mdash;was allowed to addre&s;s the Audience&mdash;and I not &s;uffered to explain or to defend my&s;elf, when I was the Party, and the only Party injured! If, at &s;uch a Cri&s;is, I betrayed any im|proper Marks of Impatience, I tru&s;t they were &s;uch as few Men could refrain from, under &s;uch di&s;tre&s;&s;ing Cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<P>THE Situation of a Theatrical Performer &s;eems here to be peculiarly unfortunate: Strong Prejudices are en|tertained again&s;t the Profe&s;&s;ion, and again&s;t the Drama it&s;elf, by many. There are al&s;o tho&s;e who con&s;ider Actors as Public Slaves, who are to have no Will of their own, but are bound to be the obedient and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive Victims of their Caprice; and &s;o wide is the Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion again&s;t the Calling, that <HI>many</HI> look upon an Actor as Something different from his fellow Men.</P>
<P>IN Con&s;equence of the&s;e Prejudices, that is deemed <HI>In&s;olence</HI> in an Actor, which would &s;carcely be called
<PB N="28" REF="032263_0027_0FF1AF356EE83978">
Spirit in another Man; and thus a Profe&s;&s;ion, which, to excel in, requires the Union of many Talents and Ac|compli&s;hments, and in particular <HI>Feeling,</HI> the Profe&s;&s;or, on &s;ome Occa&s;ions, is not allowed to <HI>feel at all.</HI> But this is certainly unju&s;t: Re&s;entment &s;hould always be mea&s;ured by the Nature of the Injury, not the <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion,</HI> of the In|dividual. I felt my&s;elf aggrieved: I was not allowed to defend my&s;elf: Few Men are &s;o much Ma&s;ters of their Temper, as to conduct with perfect Propriety in &s;uch Circum&s;tances! I might fail in this; if I did, it mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to the peculiar Irritation of the Moment; for I hope I &s;carce need add, I could never entertain an Idea, of treating with indecorum, that Public, from whom I have receiv'd the mo&s;t con&s;tant and flattering Marks of Approbation&mdash;to who&s;e Ju&s;tice I now make my la&s;t Ap|peal&punc; Who&s;e Candor will, I am convinced, acquit me after this hearing, and who&s;e</P>
