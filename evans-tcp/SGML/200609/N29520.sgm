<HEAD>THE SPEECH OF His Excellency Coll. <HI>Benjamin Fletcher,</HI> Captain General and Governour in Chief of His Majesties Pro|vince of <HI>New-York,</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> &amp;c. To the Assembly, the 7th day of <HI>April,</HI> 1600.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. Speaker, and you Gentlemen Representatives.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THe great Favours and Kindnesses we have received from Our most gracious King calls for the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> extent of Our Obedience and Gratitude.</P>
<P>His Majesty, by late Supplyes of Men, Artillery and other <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of War, with the Royal Commands for Assistance from the Neighboring Governments (if a due Complyance be made) has enabled us to withstand and oppose all our Enemies, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> in a happy Security. Nothing but our Sins can render His Majesties Care ineffectual. The blessings of Almighty God will go along with our Endeavours, if we first assert our Duty to him, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> the Deference to our Prince. Obedience to Government is a part of Religion.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 paragraph"></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="039320_0002_10141DA919D8E1E0">
It must be Considered, that all Utensils of War are but Tools, and of no use without hands to imploy them.</P>
<P>The King has sent us Men to work with these Tools for our Ease and Safety, but Men wear out, they dye, they desert, are often sick and weak; Armies and Battalions must be kept up by constant <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> else they crumble to nothing.</P>
<P>The Forces <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> much <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> since their arrival, and will be more so, unless some proper Encouragement be thought of for them, as in the like case practised in the Leeward Islands. The <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of Labourers runs so high in this Country, that most Necessitous Man rather chuse to earn their Bread by the Spade than the Sword.</P>
<P>We shall want both Men and Money to render his Majesties gracious Assistance answerable to his Royal Intentions.</P>
<P>It ought ever to be acknowledged, with an humble <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> on our parts, that notwithstanding his Majesties present Pressures, the great and bloody War he is engaged in, the daily hazards he exposes his Sacred Person to, yet he remembers this little handful of his People.</P>
<P>Let us not forget what we owe to such a King, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Royal Bounty; let us not forget our selves, but wisely <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> our own safety, by strengthening our Fronteers, which I chiefly <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to you, as the best return we can make, the most accept|able Service we can do to our King, and to our Country.</P>
<P>His Majesty that by his Royal <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> recommended to us the Building a Chappel in this Fort, a former Assembly took some notice of it. I hope you will not be wanting on your parts, to forward and finish.</P>
<P>I have <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> will give you Satisfaction. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> the Government in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, and consider that such Gentlemen as have advanced Money
<PB N="3" REF="039320_0003_10141DADAAEB4630">
upon the Credit of it, may not suffer for their Zeal for the Publick Weal, being the Money thus lent has been when Alarms or other Exigents have call'd for an immediate Care, wherein our common Safety seem'd concern'd, and at such Seasons when we could not timely meet in Assembly. I will not doubt of your Care in a matter of such Moment; you will all concur to keep up the Credit of the Governments, which in some measure is the safety of it.</P>
<P>The Money granted last Sessions is in great part left to my Dispose (it is not yet paid) I desire, for my own case and your Satisfaction, That a Committee of your House may confer with a Committee of the Council on this matter, that the Money be applyed to the Publick Good: I would have it obvious to you and all Men, that it is not converted to any by or private end, nor do I desire one penny of it should be paid <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, nor to be any further concern'd than to Sign Warrants for the payment of it to such Uses as you shall advise.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI> I wish you a good Agreement and Understanding amongst your selves, that His Majesties Favours be not lost upon us, but that the Safety, Honour and Prosperity of this Province may be timely considered, as by his Majesty in the repeated Succors he has been gratiously pleased to send us, so on our parts by an humble Acknowledgment for them, and a proper Application of them.</P>
