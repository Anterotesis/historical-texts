<HEAD>THE INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>IN the Pari&s;h of Greenfield, in the Town of Fair|field, in Connecticut, there is a plea&s;ant and beautiful eminence, called Greenfield Hill; at the di&s;tance of three miles from Long-Island Sound. On this emi|nence, there is a &s;mall but hand&s;ome Village, a Church, Academy, &amp;c. all of them alluded to in the following Poem. From the highe&s;t part of the eminence, the eye is pre&s;ented with an exten&s;ive and delightful pro&s;pect of the &s;urrounding Country, and of the Sound. On this height, the Writer is &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;tand. The First object, there offering it&s;elf to his view, is the Land&s;cape; which is accordingly made the governing &s;ubject of the Fir&s;t Part of the Poem. The flouri&s;hing and happy condition of the Inhabit|ants very naturally &s;ugge&s;ted it&s;elf next; and became of cour&s;e, the &s;ubject of the Second Part. The Town of Fairfield, lying in full view, and, not long before the Poem was begun, and in a great mea&s;ure written out, burnt by a party of Briti&s;h Troops, under the command of Governor Tryon, furni&s;hed the theme of the Third Part. A Field, called the
<PB N="06" REF="026925_0004_0FD2301CF015BCF8">
Pequod Swamp, in which, mo&s;t of the warriors of that nation, who &s;urvived the inva&s;ion of their country by Capt. Ma&s;on, were de&s;troyed, lying about three miles from the eminence abovemen|tioned, and on the margin of the Sound, &s;uggested not unnaturally, the &s;ubject of the Fourth Part.</P>
<P>As the writer is the Mini&s;ter of Greenfield, he cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to be unintere&s;ted in the welfare of his Pari&s;hioners. To excite their attention to the truths and duties of Religion (an object in &s;uch a &s;ituation, in&s;tinctively ri&s;ing to his view,) is the de&s;ign of the Fifth Part; And to promote in them ju&s;t &s;entiments and u&s;eful conduct, for the pre&s;ent life, (an object clo&s;ely connected with the preceding one) of the Sixth.</P>
<P>Many of the &s;ubjects, mentioned in the Poem, and &s;uggested by the general &s;tate of this Country, ea&s;ily led a contemplative mind to look forward, and call up to view its probable &s;ituation at a di&s;tant approaching period. The &s;olid foundations, which appear to be laid for the future greatne&s;s and pro&s;pe|rity of the American Republic, offered very plea&s;ing views of this &s;ubject to a Poet; and of the&s;e the writer has, in the Seventh Part of the Work, endea|voured to avail him&s;elf.</P>
<P>To contribute to the innocent amu&s;ement of his countrymen, and to their improvement in manners, and in oeconomical, political, and moral &s;entiments, is
<PB N="07" REF="026925_0005_0FD265120C099AA0">
the object which the writer wi&s;hes to accompli&s;h. As he is firmly per&s;uaded, that his countrymen are furni&s;hed by Providence with as exten&s;ive and advantageous means of pro&s;perity, as the world has hitherto &s;een, &s;o he thinks it the duty and the intere&s;t of every citizen, to promote it, by all the means in his power. Poetry appears to him to be one, among the probable means of advancing this purpo&s;e. "Allow me to make the Songs of a nation," &s;aid a wi&s;e man, "and who will may make their Laws." Poetry may not, perhaps, produce greater effects in promoting the pro&s;perity of mankind, than philo&s;ophy; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Lowth's Lectures on Heb. Po.</NOTE> but the effects which it produces, are far from being &s;mall. Where truth requires little illu&s;tration, and only needs to be &s;et in a &s;trong and affecting light, Poetry appears to be as advantageous an in&s;trument of making u&s;eful impre&s;&s;ions, as can be ea&s;ily con|ceived. It will be read by many per&s;ons, who would &s;carcely look at a logical di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; by mo&s;t readers it will be more deeply felt, and more la&s;tingly remembered; and, to &s;ay the lea&s;t, it will, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, be an unu&s;ual, and for that rea&s;on may be a forcible method of treating &s;everal &s;ubjects, handled in this Poem.</P>
<P>When the writer began the work, he had no de&s;ign of publi&s;hing it; aiming merely to amu&s;e his own mind, and to gain a temporary relief from the
<PB N="08" REF="026925_0006_0FD23020D0D70130">
pre&s;&s;ure of melancholy. Hence it was dropped, at an early period; when other avocations, or amu&s;e|ments pre&s;ented them&s;elves. The greater part of it was written &s;even years ago. Additions have been made to it, at different periods, from that time to the pre&s;ent&mdash;This will account for the dates of &s;everal things mentioned in it, which would otherwi&s;e &s;eem to be improperly connected.</P>
<P>Originally the writer de&s;igned to imitate, in the &s;everal parts, the manner of as many Briti&s;h Poets; but finding him&s;elf too much occupied, when he projected the publication, to pur&s;ue that de&s;ign, he relinqui&s;hed it. The little appearance of &s;uch a de&s;ign, &s;till remaining, was the re&s;ult of di&s;tant and general recollection. Much, of that nature, he has rejected, and all he would have rejected, had not even that rejection demanded more time than he could afford for &s;uch a purpo&s;e. The&s;e facts will, he hopes, apologize to the reader, for the mixed manner which he may, at times, ob&s;erve in the performance.</P>

THE ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IN the beginning of July 1779, the Briti&s;h, under the command of Sir George Collyer, and Governor Tryon, plundered New-Haven. Thence they &s;ailed to Fairfield, plundered, and burned it. Eighty-five dwelling hou&s;es, two churches, a hand|&s;ome court hou&s;e, &s;everal &s;chool hou&s;e&s;, together with a great number of barns, out-hou&s;es, &amp;c. were con&s;umed by the fire. Many other hou&s;es were &s;et on fire; but were extingui&s;hed by the returning inhabitants. The di&s;tre&s;s, occa&s;ioned by this act of wanton barbarity, is inconceivable; and the name of Governor Tryon will, on account of it, be remembered with the mo&s;t fini&s;hed dete&s;tation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>From l. 1, to l. 283, the &s;tory is related. The reader is then addre&s;&s;ed with a repre&s;entation of the happine&s;s de&s;troyed at Fairfield, and with an account of the prevalence of war, in ancient, and in modern times; its nature and its effects on the morals and happine&s;s of mankind. This addre&s;s extends to l, 547, and is &s;ucceeded by an Addre&s;s to the Hero, returning victorious from war. He is fir&s;t pre&s;ented with a picture of the mi&s;eries of war, on the land; and is then conducted to the &s;hore, to take a &s;urvey of maritime war.&mdash;Death&mdash;Speech of Death&mdash;Motives to ab&s;tain from war&mdash;and Conclu&s;ion.</HI></P>

THE ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE Pequods inhabited the branches of the Thames, which empties it&s;elf into the Sound, at New London. This nation, from the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of the Engli&s;h Coloni&s;ts, regarded them with jealou&s;y; and attempted to engage the neighbouring tribes in a combination again&s;t them. Several of tho&s;e tribes were, however, more jealous of the Pequods, than of the Engli&s;h, and rejected their &s;olicitations Not di&s;couraged by the&s;e di&s;ap|pointments, they re&s;olved to attempt the de&s;truction of the Eng|li&s;h, with the &s;trength of their own tribes only; and cruelly a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated Captains Stone, Norton, and Oldham, as they were trading peaceably in their neighbourhood. The Engli&s;h de|manded the murderers; but were an&s;wered with di&s;dain, and in&s;ult. Upon this, Captain Ma&s;on was di&s;patched into their country with a body of troops; and attacking one of their principal forts, de&s;troyed it, together with a large number of their warriors. The re&s;t of the nation fled. A large body of them come to a &s;wamp, three miles we&s;tward of Fairfield. One of their number loitering behind the re&s;t, was di&s;covered by the Engli&s;h troops, then commanded by Captain Stoughton, of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts; and was compelled to di&s;clo&s;e their retreat. One hundred of them, it is &s;aid, &s;urrendered. The re&s;t, bravely re&s;olving to live and die together, were attacked, and chiefly de&s;troyed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Neale's Hi&s;t. N.

<HEAD>NOTES TO PART I.</HEAD>
<P>LINE 42. The pari&s;h of Greenfield con&s;i&s;ts of about thirteen &s;quare miles. On this little tract were found, at the time of the late cen&s;us, al|mo&s;t fourteen hundred inhabitants: a population as great, as that of Britain, if the accounts which I have &s;een, of the extent and population of that country, are ju&s;t. The people of Greenfield are almo&s;t all Farmers, and have no advantages for &s;upport, be&s;ides tho&s;e which are common to N. England in general. Thus without any peculiar a&s;&s;i&s;tance from com|merce, or manufacturing, an immen&s;e population can exi&s;t on the mere labours of the hu&s;bandman. The people of Greenfield, al&s;o, very generally abound in the nece&s;&s;aries and comforts of life. Such are the effects of an equal divi&s;ion of property, and of the cultivation of lands by the pro|prietors.</P>
<P>L. 85. No country has been more unju&s;tly or contemptibly &s;landered, than New England.</P>
<P>L. 94. [Firms.] I have ventured to u&s;e this word, as a verb. It appeared to me better to expre&s;s the idea intended, than any other word, which I could recollect.</P>
<P>L. 177. A remarkable proof of the mildne&s;s of manners, in New Eng|land, exi&s;ted during the late war. The inhabitants were at lea&s;t as much divided, and as directly oppo&s;ed, both in opinion and conduct, as tho&s;e of France; and through a much longer period. <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>January</HI> 1, 1793.</NOTE> Yet not one per&s;on was put to death by the hand of violence, and but one by the hand of civil ju&s;tice, during an eight years war, and in a country containing a million of inhabitants.</P>
<P>L. 215. The State of Connecticut exhibits the mo&s;t uniform and un|mixed manners, to be found in New England; and tho&s;e, which may, with the greate&s;t propriety, be called the national manners of that country.</P>
<P>L. 223. The happine&s;s of the inhabitants of Connecticut appears, like their manners, morals, and government, to exceed any thing, of which the Ea&s;tern continent could ever boa&s;t. A thorough and impartial deve|lopement of the &s;tate of &s;ociety, in Connecticut, and a complete inve&s;ti|gation of the &s;ources of its happine&s;s, would probably throw more light on the true methods of promoting the intere&s;ts of mankind, than all the vo|lumes of philo&s;ophy, which have been written. The cau&s;es, which have already produced happine&s;s, will ever produce it. To facts alone, there|fore,
<PB N="170" REF="026925_0156_0FD26646171B15B8"> 
ought we to re&s;ort, if we would obtain this important knowledge. Theories are u&s;ually mere dreams; fitted to amu&s;e, not to in&s;truct; and Philo&s;ophers, at lea&s;t political ones, are u&s;ually mere Theori&s;ts. The com|mon &s;en&s;e of the early Coloni&s;ts of New England &s;aw farther into political &s;ubjects, tho&s;e at lea&s;t, which are of great importance to human happine&s;s, than all the Philo&s;ophers, who have written &s;ince the world began.</P>
<P>L 225. Nothing can be more vi&s;ionary, than many modern Philo|&s;ophic opinions, concerning government. All human &s;y&s;tems, re&s;pecting practical &s;ubjects, unle&s;s derived from facts, will ever be vi&s;ionary, and de&s;erve to be cla<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ed with &s;ub&s;tantial forms, &s;ubtil matter, and atomic ten|dency to exertion. Man is wholly unable, by mere contemplation, to bring into his view a number of principles &s;ufficient to con&s;titute a theory, which can con&s;i&s;t with practice. One would imagine, that the univer&s;al fate of hypothetical philo&s;ophy mu&s;t long &s;ince have taught ingenious men this obvious truth; but the pleasure of making, and defending, &s;y&s;tems, is &s;o great, that &s;uch men are &s;till employed in building air-ca&s;tles, and in &s;eri|ou&s;ly expecting to inhabit them.</P>
<P>L. 234. If gentlemen, who are natives of Europe, &s;hould think this paragraph har&s;h, or unfounded, the writer reque&s;ts them &s;o far to turn their attention to the &s;everal facts, mentioned in it, as to &s;atisfy them|&s;elves, whether the a&s;cription be ju&s;t, or erroneous. The natives of Great Britain, particularly, will find, in di&s;tingui&s;hed writers of that country, de&s;criptions of Briti&s;h &s;ociety, warranting all, that is a&s;&s;erted in this poem: de&s;criptions confirmed, &s;o far, at lea&s;t, as the author's acquaintance has extended, by tho&s;e Americans, who have travelled into Britain. The <HI>Tu&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">,</HI> one of the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible and valuable performances, in the Engli&s;h lan|guage, is alone a &s;ufficient ju&s;tification of no &s;mall part of what is here declared.</P>
<P>L. 247. It is, perhaps, not to be wondered at, that the &s;tate of &s;o|ciety, lately exi&s;ting in France, &s;hould be followed by exten&s;ive and ridi|culous infidelity; but that &s;uch a &s;peech as that &s;aid to be uttered, Dec. 1792, by Citizen Dupont, &s;hould have been &s;poken by any man, on any occa&s;ion, and before any audience, would hardly have been believed, unle&s;s publi&s;hed with high authentication. That it &s;hould have been uttered by a man, characterized as a man of weight and influence, is &s;till more a&s;toni&s;hing: and that it &s;hould have been received, by the Legi&s;lative A&s;|&s;embly of a great Nation, with applau&s;e, is a Tact, which&punc; if it &s;hould, unhappily, for the honour of human nature, be banded to po&s;terity, will probably be regarded rather as a Provencal legend, than as a reality. Of the like contemptible character are the later declarations of Citizen La|croix, on the petition of the Quakers and Anabapti&s;ts; in which are the following words. "The Con&s;titution is my Go&s;pel, and Liberty is my God. I know no other" The&s;e gentlemen appear ambitious of ri|valling the character of Aretine, on who&s;e tomb this in&s;cription is &s;aid to have been written.</P>
<LG>
<L>Here lies Aretine,</L>
<L>Who &s;poke evil of every one,</L>
<L>But his God;</L>
<L>And in this he mu&s;t be excu&s;ed,</L>
<L>Becau&s;e he did not know him.</L>
</LG>
<P>L. 248. I have &s;een a memorial, &s;aid to be pre&s;ented to his Briti&s;h Ma|je&s;ty, by the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council, of London;
<PB N="171" REF="026925_0157_0FD26629A85539D0">
in which they declare, that within ten years, 4,800 per&s;ons had, in that city, been convicted of felony. <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>In the Lent circuit</HI> (1786) 286 <HI>per&s;ons were capitally convicted in England; and from</HI> 960 <HI>to</HI> 1000 <HI>convicts are now annually transported from that country.</HI></NOTE> In New England, which contains more inhabitants than London, it is to be questioned, whether, in any ten years, &s;ince it was &s;ettled by the Engli&s;h, there have been ten persons convicted of felony. A partial account, for this enormous di&s;proportion, may be found in the mildne&s;s of the laws of New England, which are far le&s;s &s;an|guinary, than tho&s;e of Great Britain. It may al&s;o be ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, that London is a city of enormous wealth, and enormous poverty, and a ge|neral receptacle of &s;harpers and villains from the whole Briti&s;h empire; as well as from &s;everal other countries. But it is al&s;o to be remembered, that a great proportion of the felons, convicted in New England, are natives of Europe. It is probable that the &s;ubject cannot be explained in any manner, which will not involve, as its principal cau&s;es, the very great difference, in the re&s;pective places, to be found in the univer&s;ality of happine&s;s, and in the purity of morals.</P>
<P>L. 267. [See every heart, &amp;c.] The fa&s;hions of Europe, e&s;pecially of Britain and France, &s;uit neither the climate, the convenience, the policy, the property&punc; nor the character, of this country. The changes of climate in this country require modes of dre&s;&s;ing very different from tho&s;e, which are healthful in France and England. The Americans are generally people of bu&s;ine&s;s, and, of cour&s;e, mu&s;t be greatly and continually incommoded by an adoption of many foreign fa&s;hions. Our policy naturally teaches us to reject all &s;ervile imitation of the manners of other countries; and all con&s;tant imitation is attended with &s;ervility. The dignified character of free republicans ought to lead them to de&s;pi&s;e a perpetual change in the figure of dre&s;s; to-aim only at &s;uch modes as are convenient, and to per|&s;evere in them; to &s;hew their independence, in the choice of their own modes, and their ingenuity in the invention of them; and to manife&s;t a total &s;uperiority to the mi&s;erable frippery of artificial &s;ociety. In the mean time, our pecuniary circum&s;tances would be advantageou&s;ly con&s;ulted, by the adoption of dre&s;s, in all re&s;pects &s;uch as might well con&s;i&s;t with our general mediocrity of wealth. The Friends appear to &s;hew much good &s;en&s;e on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>L. 279. War has exi&s;ted, in &s;ome, or other, of the countries of Europe, 75 years, out of the 92, which have elap&s;ed, &s;ince the beginning of the pre&s;ent century; a century boa&s;ted of, as the mo&s;t enlightened, refined, and humane, within the knowledge of mankind. The cau&s;es of the&s;e wars have; al&s;o; been generally &s;uch; as ought to cover the authors of them with deep and perpetual infamy.</P>
<P>L. 296. Few objects more demand the attention of men of influence, in this country, than the e&s;tabli&s;hment of national manners. That much may be done, for this purpo&s;e, will not, I pre&s;ume, be que&s;tioned, There are but two, or three countries, in the United States, in which the man|ners have any thing like a general uniformity: the low country of Vir|ginia, the low country of South Carolina, and New England. The man|ners of Virginia and South Carolina cannot be ea&s;ily continued, without the continuance of the Negro &s;lavery; an event, which can &s;carcely be expected. The manners of New England appear to be rapidly &s;preading through the American republic; the natives of that country being generally
<PB N="172" REF="026925_0158_0FD2664762992D80">
even more tenacious of their manners, when abroad, than when at home. When the enterprize, indu&s;try, oeconomy, morals, and happine&s;s, of New England, e&s;pecially of Connecticut, are attentively con&s;idered, the patriotic mind will perhaps find much more rea&s;on to rejoice in this pro&s;pect, than to regret it.</P>
<P>L. 297. [Think whence this weal aro&s;e.] The peculiar pro&s;perity of New England in general, and particularly of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and Connecticut, undoubtedly ari&s;es from the equal divi&s;ion of property, the univer&s;al e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;chools, and their peculiar manner of &s;upporting the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>L. 430. [Ah! knew he but his happine&s;s, &amp;c.] Ah! knew he but his happine&s;s, of men the happie&s;t he, &amp;c. &mdash; <HI>Thom&s;on.</HI></P>

<HEAD>NOTES TO PART II.</HEAD>
<P>LINE 1. This part of the poem, though appropriated to the pari&s;h of Greenfield, may be con&s;idered as a general de&s;cription of the towns and villages of New England; tho&s;e only excepted, which are either commer|cial, new, or &s;ituated on a barren &s;oil. Moro&s;e and gloomy per&s;ons, and perhaps &s;ome others, may think the de&s;cription too highly coloured. Per|&s;ons of moderation and candour may po&s;&s;ibly think otherwi&s;e. In its full extent, the writer &s;uppo&s;es it applicable to the be&s;t inhabitants only; but he believes the number of the&s;e to be great: to others he thinks it partially applicable. Poetical repre&s;entations are u&s;ually e&s;teemed flattering; po&s;|&s;ibly this is as little &s;o, as mo&s;t of them. The inhabitants of New Eng|land, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome modern in&s;tances of declension, are, at lea&s;t in the Writer's opinion, a &s;ingular example of virtue and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>It will be ea&s;ily di&s;covered by the reader, that this part of the poem is de&s;igned to illu&s;trate the effects of the &s;tate of property, which is the coun|ter part to that, &s;o beautifully exhibited by Dr. Gold&s;mith, in the De&s;erted Village. That excellent writer, in a mo&s;t intere&s;ting manner, di&s;plays the wretched condition of the many, where enormous wealth, &s;plendour, and luxury, con&s;titute the &s;tate of the few. In this imperfect attempt, the writer wi&s;hed to exhibit the ble&s;&s;ings, which flow from an equal divi&s;ion of property, and a general competence.</P>
<P>Wherever an <HI>equal divi&s;ion of property</HI> is mentioned, in the Work, the Reader is reque&s;ted to remember, that that &s;tate of things only is intended, in which every citizen is &s;ecured in the avails of his indu&s;try and prudence, and in which property de&s;cends, by law, in equal &s;hares, to the proprietor's children.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="026925_0159_0FD2662B23DA4C88">
L. 1. Sweet Auburn, lovelie&s;t village of the plain! <HI>Goldsmith</HI></P>
<P>L. 12. [The &s;pring bird.] A &s;mall bird, called, in &s;ome parts of New England, by that name; which appears, very early in the &s;pring, on the banks of brooks and &s;mall rivers, and &s;ings a very &s;weet and &s;prightly note.</P>

[Slump'd.] This word, &s;aid, in England, to be of North Country original, is cu&s;tomarily u&s;ed in New England, to denote the &s;ud|den &s;inking of the foot in the earth, when partially thawn, as in the month of March. It is al&s;o u&s;ed to denote the &s;udden &s;inking of the earth under the foot.</P>

<P>L. 79, and 80. And every want, to opulence allied, And every pang that folly pays to pride. <HI>Gold&s;mith.</HI></P>
<P>L. 91, O luxury! thou cur&s;t by heaven's decree. <HI>Goldsmith.</HI></P>
<P>L. 91, &amp;c. Men in middling circum&s;tances appear greatly to excel the rich, in piety, charity, and public &s;pirit; nor will a critical ob&s;erver of hu|man life he&s;itate to believe, that they enjoy more happine&s;s.</P>

<P>L. 221. The black children are generally &s;prightly and ingenious, until they become con&s;cious of their &s;lavery. This u&s;ually happens, when they are 4, 5, or 6 years of age. From that time, they u&s;ually &s;ink into &s;tu|pidity, or give them&s;elves up to vice.</P>
<P>L. 237. If we con&s;ider how few inducements the blacks have to in|genious, or worthy efforts, we &s;hall more wonder, that there are, among them, &s;o many, than that there are &s;o few, examples of ingenuity or amiablene&s;s.</P>

<P>L. 251, 252. [Home, Monboddo.] Two modern philo&s;ophers, who have publi&s;hed &s;everal ingenious dreams, concerning the fir&s;t inhabitants of this world.</P>

<P>L. 295. See the &s;peech of Mr. Bri&s;&s;ot, in the National A&s;&s;embly of France, Dec. 1, 1791. If the authority here quoted, for the&s;e particular in&s;tances of cruelty, exerci&s;ed on the unhappy Africans, in the We&s;t Indies, &s;hould be thought doubtful, the reader may find, in the evidence taken, on this &s;ubject, by the Committee of the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons, an immen&s;e number of in&s;tances, in which inhumanity, equally reprehen&s;ible, has been undoubtedly practi&s;ed on the&s;e unhappy people.</P>

<HEAD>NOTES TO PART III.</HEAD>
<P>LINE 15. On the plain, on which Fairfield is built, are &s;everal eminences of uncommon beauty.</P>
<P>L. 115. There were &s;everal acts of gro&s;s abu&s;e, and of &s;avage barbarity, practi&s;ed by the Briti&s;h, when they burned Fairfield.</P>
<P>L. 143. That inferiors, in &s;ubordination, are bound to obey all, even the unju&s;t and immoral commands of their &s;uperiors, and that the inferior is; in this conduct, ju&s;tifiable, and the &s;uperior alone guilty, is &s;till not un|frequently a&s;&s;erted, and therefore probably believed. When it &s;hall be right to do evil, that good may come, when crimes and virtuous actions, with the guilt, and the merit, of them &s;hall become transferable, when man &s;hall cea&s;e to be accountable to his MAKER, and when GOD &s;hall no more rule, with rightful authority, over his own creatures, this doctrine will probably re&s;t on a more &s;olid ba&s;is.</P>
<P>L. 181. None of the numerous and horrid evils of war is more wanton, more u&s;ele&s;s, and more indicative of the wor&s;t character, than burning. No nation, by which it is either allowed, or done, ought to make a claim to humanity, or civilization.</P>
<P>L. 231. There was a heavy thunder &s;torm, on the night, in which Fairfield was burned; yet &s;uch was the confu&s;ion and di&s;tre&s;s of the re|maining inhabitants, that &s;everal of them did not perceive it.</P>
<P>L. 168. From Fairfield, the Briti&s;h proceeded to Norwalk; which they burned, the next day. It de&s;erves to be remembered, that, during the conflagration Governor Try on had a chair carried to the top of an eminence, in that town, called Grummon's h<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ll; and there, at his ea&s;e, enjoyed the pro&s;pect, and the plea&s;ure, of the &s;cene. Two churches, 135 dwelling hou&s;es, with a proportional number of other buildings, were de&s;troyed, at Norwalk. Eight other towns, in the United States, experienced the &s;ame fate; and while immen&s;e evil was done to the inhabitants, no benefit ac|crued, as none plainly could accrue, to their enemies.</P>
<P>L. 365. It is probable, that more of human labour, ingenuity, and property has been expended in the various bu&s;ine&s;s of de&s;truction, than in all the arts, by which peace and happine&s;s have been promoted.</P>
<P>L. 405. Every per&s;on, acquainted with the hi&s;tory of the Romans, knows that the temple of Janus was &s;hut, whenever they were in a &s;tate of peace, and that this happened but twice, during the fir&s;t 750 years of their national exi&s;tence. Mankind in general have been engaged in war, with almo&s;t as little intermi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It would be worth the labour of &s;ome friend to mankind, to pre&s;ent the public with a complete view of the time, during which war has exi&s;ted in Europe, &s;ince the de&s;truction of the Roman empire; the number of nations concerned in each war; the &s;ums expended; the debts incurred; the &s;oldiers, &s;ailors, and citizens, de&s;troyed; the cities towns, and villages, burnt, plundered, and ruined; the mi&s;eries, known to be &s;uffered; the mo&s;t pro|bable cau&s;es of the re&s;pective wars; and the gain re&s;ulting to the re&s;pective combatants. Tho&s;e, who have acce&s;s to large libraries would probably find, in them, much of the information, nece&s;&s;ary to a de&s;ign of this na|ture.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="026925_0162_0FD2664CF8F008D8">
L. 487. The injury, done by war, to the morals of a country, is inferior to none of the evils, which it &s;uffers. A century is in&s;ufficient to repair the moral wa&s;te of a &s;hort war.</P>
<P>L. 553. [Go then, ah go.] It is probable, that whenever mankind &s;hall cea&s;e to make war, this mo&s;t de&s;irable event will ari&s;e from the general oppo&s;ition, made to war, by the common voice. Hence the peculiar im|portance of diffu&s;ing this oppo&s;ition, as widely as po&s;&s;ible, e&s;pecially by education. If parents, &s;chool-ma&s;ters, and clergymen, would unite their efforts, for this mo&s;t benevolent and glorious purpo&s;e, the effects of &s;uch an union, on the ri&s;ing generation, would probably exceed the mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes.</P>
<P>L. 601. Some of the fixed &s;tars are, from evident alterations in their appearance, called changeable &s;tars. The &s;tar, Aegol, or Medu&s;a's head, as a remarkable one; and changes, from the fir&s;t, to the fourth magnitude.</P>
<P>L. 659. The cu&s;tom of privateering is one of the reliques of Gothic barbarity. No good rea&s;on can be given, why commi&s;&s;ions, to plunder and de&s;troy hou&s;es, &s;hould not be given to private per&s;ons, as well as to plunder and de&s;troy ve&s;&s;els; to rob on the land, as well as on the &s;ea; and why &s;uch per&s;ons, as re&s;i&s;ted, &s;hould not be put to death, in the one ca&s;e, as well as in the other. Cu&s;tom, it is pre&s;umed, is the only ground of any difference of opinion, with regard to the ca&s;es propo&s;ed. All privateering is robbery, and murder; and the government, which &s;anctions privateering, is guilty of authorizing the&s;e horrid crimes. Nor can the merchant, who is the proprietor, be excu&s;ed from his &s;hare in the guilt.</P>

<P>L. 307. The greate&s;t ob&s;tacle to chri&s;tianizing the Indians is now, as it has u&s;ually been, their rivetted per&s;ua&s;ion, that the Briti&s;h Coloni&s;ts, in all their corre&s;pondence with them, have aimed at their own benefit, not at the benefit of the Indians; at the acqui&s;ition of their lands, not at the &s;alvation of their &s;ouls: a per&s;ua&s;ion founded on too unequivocal and &s;hameful proof. So long as tho&s;e, who trade with them, are allowed to poi&s;on them by all the means of corruption, virtuous men can only regret their mi&s;erable condition. It is to be hoped, that the late act of Congre&s;s, re|gulating our corre&s;pondence with the Indians, together with &s;everal other humane and ju&s;t mea&s;ures of the &s;ame nature, mea&s;ures which reflect the highe&s;t honour on that Body, will, in a good degree, remove the&s;e evils.</P>

L. 289. [The fir&s;t of May.] The day, on which accounts are u&s;ually adju&s;ted, and pecuniary obligations di&s;charged, in the &s;tate of New-York.</P>
<P>L. 297. For more than twenty years, the writer of this poem has been employed in the bu&s;ine&s;s of education, and, in that time, has had, in a greater or le&s;s degree, the &s;uperintendence of almo&s;t a thou&s;and young per|&s;ons, of both &s;exes. Almo&s;t all the &s;entiments here expre&s;&s;ed, concerning the in&s;truction, government, and habituation, of children, he has &s;een often proved to be ju&s;t, through the whole cour&s;e of this exten&s;ive expe|rience. He is induced to the&s;e ob&s;ervations by a full, experimental con|viction of the entirely theoretical and vi&s;ionary nature of &s;everal modern opinions on the &s;ubject; opinions, publi&s;hed by men, of genius indeed, but wholly inexperienced in education; men who educate children on paper, as a geometrician circumnavigates the globe, in half a dozen &s;pherical triangles. On &s;ome future occa&s;ion, he may, perhaps, take the liberty to offer to the public &s;ome further &s;entiments, on this copions and very inter|e&s;ting subject. In the mean time, he believes, that the&s;e may be &s;afely adopted by &s;uch, as have not acquired more exten&s;ive information, and for &s;uch only are they de&s;igned.</P>
<P>L. 447. No principle of action will u&s;ually be of any &s;ervice to children, unle&s;s it be made habitual.</P>
<P>L. 451. I believe, that there are very few children, who might not be rendered amiable and worthy, if their parents would begin their efforts in &s;ea&s;on, and continue them &s;teadily, without yielding to either &s;loth, or di&s;|couragement.</P>
<P>L. 471. In mo&s;t places in New England, the pari&s;h bell is rung, at 9 o'clock, in the evening: a cu&s;tom, which has more influence in promoting good order, than a &s;light ob&s;erver would imagine.</P>
<P>L. 531. There are many &s;ocial libraries in Connecticut; and the num|ber is fa&s;t increa&s;ing. This is vi&s;ibly one of the be&s;t means of diffu&s;ing knowledge. If the proprietors of each would tax them&s;elves a &s;mall &s;uch yearly, they would &s;oon be able to procure a &s;ufficient number of books, to an&s;wer every valuable purpo&s;e of &s;uch an in&s;titution.</P>
<P>L. 567. I once knew a farmer, who &s;teadily did what was called a good day's-work, and yet employed &s;everal hours, every day, in reading.</P>
<P>L. 570. Several of the mo&s;t u&s;eful and re&s;pectable men, in America, were privately educated; and &s;ome of them, with very &s;mall advantages.</P>
<P>L. 637. [A town&s;man.] In New England, the prudentials of each town are commonly placed under the direction of a &s;mall number of men, cho&s;en for that purpo&s;e, and called indifferently &s;electmen or town&s;men.</P>

<P>A per&s;on of delicacy, and virtue, is naturally led to wonder, that a man of &s;uch talents, as Mr. Pope po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and entertaining the very ju&s;t &s;en|timents, expre&s;&s;ed in the&s;e fini&s;hed lines, &s;hould have written, publi&s;hed, and left to be handed down to po&s;terity, a great number of ver&s;es, which he has actually: written, and publi&s;hed. In his Rape of the Look, there are &s;everal lines plainly indelicate, and &s;ome gro&s;sly ob&s;cene. In his Eloi&s;a to Abelard, the &s;entiments are, in &s;ome in&s;tances, gro&s;s and noxious. Yet the&s;e are his fir&s;t performances. His Moral E&s;&s;ays (particularly the &s;econd) tre&s;pa&s;s, at times, again&s;t truth, ju&s;tice and decency. The &s;ame is too often true of his satires. The Dunciad is, in &s;everal places, a &s;everer &s;atire on the author, than on the objects of his re&s;entment: not to mention &s;everal of his &s;maller imitations of other poets, and the hideous volume, publi&s;hed as a &s;upplement to his acknowledged works.</P>
<P>No Writer ought ever to publi&s;h a &s;entiment, or expre&s;&s;ion (unle&s;s when &s;ome &s;cientifical, or other important purpo&s;e nece&s;&s;itates it) which cannot be read, in a mixed company, of Ladies and Gentlemen, without giving pain to the mo&s;t refined and delicate mind.</P>

The drummer of Mr. Addi&s;on offends, not unfrequently, again&s;t decency. There are al&s;o, in his other works, a few pa&s;&s;ages, which one could wi&s;h had been expunged. The&s;e facts are a proof of unhappy yielding to the ta&s;te of his times, in a man, who was an ornament to human nature.</P>
<P>L. 503. It is not a little injurious to the honour of human nature, that the elegant arts of Poetry, Painting, and Mu&s;ic, have, in Europe, been &s;o often pro&s;tituted to the celebration of vile characters, to the di&s;play of &s;ub|jects and &s;entiments gro&s;s and pernicious, and to the commemoration of facts, which deeply &s;tain the name of man.</P>
<P>L. 535. Infidel philo&s;ophers frequently impeach, and affect to de&s;pi&s;e, the evidence of te&s;timony. Yet their own rea&s;onings are generally attended with evidence, and mo&s;t u&s;ually founded on evidence, which, in clearne&s;s and &s;trength, is far inferior to that of te&s;timony: a great part of their &s;en|timents being mere and trifling hypothe&s;es.</P>
<P>L. 565. Warton, in his E&s;&s;ay on the genius and writings of Pope, ob|&s;erves, that mediocrity is the &s;ituation, mo&s;t favourable to the exertions of genius. It is al&s;o the &s;ituation, evidently mo&s;t friendly to national, and individual, virtue and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>L. 583. There is &s;omething &s;ingularly unhappy in the attempts of the Americans to imitate the burthen&s;ome o&s;tentation of Europe. Americans are not, and probably will not &s;oon be, &s;ufficiently acquainted with the round of European form, and etiquette, to adopt it with either &s;kill, or grace. At the &s;ame time, we have not, and, without entailments, never &s;hall in any great number of in&s;tances have, wealth &s;ufficient to &s;upport the nece&s;&s;ary expen&s;e.</P>
<P>Common Sen&s;e, Philo&s;ophy, and Religion, alike condemn &s;uch manners, in every in&s;tance, and view them, as the painful efforts of folly to lift it&s;elf into re&s;pectability. The plain manners of Republicans, incomparably le&s;&s; burthen&s;ome, and more graceful and plea&s;ing, are our own native manners: &s;uch manners, as made the Gaul e&s;teem the Roman &s;enate an a&s;&s;embly of gods; and the courtier Cineas con&s;ider the citizens of Rome, as a collection of kings.</P>
<P>Sensible travellers, who&s;e manners are generally viewed as more fini&s;hed, and plea&s;ing, than any other, appear u&s;ually to acquire a contempt, and di&s;u&s;e, of ceremony, and to adopt a plainer behaviour, than mo&s;t other men of breeding. A per&s;evering adoption of plain manners, by men of influence, would give them a general and la&s;ting &s;anction; and prove of more real benefit to the pre&s;ent, and future, inhabitants of America, than renowned victories, or immen&s;e acqui&s;itions of territory.</P>
<P>It may, perhaps, be &s;aid, as it often has been &s;aid, though with neither di&s;cernment, nor truth, that parade is nece&s;&s;ary to give energy to law, and dignity to government. It may be an&s;wered, that no laws have greater energy, and no government was ever more re&s;pected, than tho&s;e of Con|necticut have u&s;ually been, for more than 150 years. Yet in Connecticut, parade is unknown in practice, and despised by the universal opinion.&mdash;The truth is, people of mere common sense, and uneducated to ceremony, always de&s;pile it: it's introduction, therefore, is always owing to the vanity, and weakne&s;s, of men in &s;uperior &s;tations, or ranks, of life.</P>
<P>L. 597. There is rea&s;on to believe, that the women, in New England, in all that renders the female character re&s;pectable, and lovely, are inferior to none, in the world. They blend the useful, and the plea&s;ing, the refined, and the excellent, into a most delightful, and dignified union; and

well de&s;erve, from the other &s;ex, that high regard, and polite attention, which form a very re&s;pectable branch of our national manners.</P>
<P>L. 657. One of the greate&s;t improvements, which the pre&s;ent age has made, in the progre&s;s of &s;ociety, is the public diminution of military glory, and the elevation of character, acquired by benevolence. Thus Howard is a name more celebrated, than Cae&s;ar, or Marlborough.</P>
