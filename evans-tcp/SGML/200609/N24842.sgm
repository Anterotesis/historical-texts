<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>"PRAY what does the author mean?" is the fir&s;t que&s;tion mo&s;t readers will a&s;k, and the la&s;t they are able to an&s;wer. Therefore in a word I will explain the &s;ubject and de|&s;ign of the following poem.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject is the &s;tate of the times in re|gard to literature and religion. The author was prompted to write by a hope that it might be of u&s;e to point out, in a clear, conci&s;e, and &s;triking manner, tho&s;e general errors, that hinder the advantages of education, and the growth of piety. The &s;ubject is inexhau&s;tible; nor is my de&s;ign yet completed. This fir&s;t part de&s;cribes the principal mi&s;takes in one cour&s;e of life, and exemplifies the following well known truth, That to the frequent &s;candal, as well of religion, as learning, a fellow without any &s;hare of genius, or application to &s;tudy, may pa&s;s with credit through life, receive the honours of a liberal education, and be admit|ted to the right hand of fellow&s;hip among mi|ni&s;ters of the go&s;pel. That, except in one neighbouring province, ignorance wanders unmole&s;ted at our colleges, examinations are dwindled to meer form and ceremony, and af|ter four years dozing there, no one is ever re|fu&s;ed the honours, of a degree, on account of dulne&s;s and in&s;ufficiency. That the meer knowledge of ancient languages, of the ab&s;tru|&s;er
<PB N="iv" REF="032943_0003_0FF5E8CB612E6E38">
parts of mathematics, and the dark re|&s;earches of metaphy&s;ics, is of little advantage in bu&s;ine&s;s or profe&s;&s;ion in life. That it would be more beneficial, in every place of public education, to take pains in teaching the ele|ments of oratory, the grammar of the Engli&s;h tongue, and the elegancies of &s;tyle, and com|po&s;ition. That in numberle&s;s in&s;tances thro'|out the&s;e colonies, &s;ufficient care hath not been taken to exclude the ignorant and irreligious, from the &s;acred de&s;k. That this tenderne&s;s to the unde&s;erving, tends to deba&s;e the dignity of the clergy, and to hinder many worthy men from undertaking the office of the mini&s;try. And that the virulent controver&s;ies of the pre|&s;ent day concerning religious, or in many ca&s;es, merely &s;peculative opinions, &s;avouring &s;o high|ly of vanity and o&s;tentation, and breathing a &s;pirit &s;o oppo&s;ite to chri&s;tian benevolence, have done more hurt to the cau&s;e of religion, than all the malice, the ridicule, and the folly of its enemies.</P>

<L>In primer, &s;pelling book or p&s;alter.</L>
<L>Hard work indeed, he does not love it;</L>
<L>His genius is too much above it.</L>
<L>Give him a good &s;ub&s;tantial teacher,</L>
<L>I'll lay he makes a &s;pecial preacher.</L>
<L>I've lov'd good learning all my life;</L>
