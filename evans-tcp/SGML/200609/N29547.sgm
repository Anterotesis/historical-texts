<HEAD>To his Excellency <HI>Richard</HI> Earl of <HI>Bellomont,</HI> Capt. General and Governour in Chief of his Maje&s;ties Province of <HI>New-York, &amp;c.</HI> The Humble Petition and Remon&s;trance of the Repre&s;entatives of this His Maje&s;ties Province of <HI>New-York</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> convened in General A&s;&s;embly.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>May it Plea&s;e your Lordship;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE the Repre&s;entatives of this His Maje&s;ties Province convened in General A&s;&s;embly, do with all due Re&s;pect and Humility, approach your Lord&s;hip, to a&s;&s;ure you, That the &s;ame Inviolable Loyalty which has hitherto affected and inflamed our hearts towards the Crown and Government of <HI>England,</HI> will ever pre&s;erve us in a mo&s;t Religious and &s;teady Per&s;everence therein, being throughly &s;en&s;ible how great a Ble&s;&s;ing it is to be &s;ubject to the be&s;t and greate&s;t of Kings, and under &s;o Noble a Con&s;titution of Laws, as makes <HI>ENGLAND</HI> this day the Envy of all its Neighbour Nations. Yet we cannot but with great grief of heart repre&s;ent to your Lord&s;hip, that we have not of late Years enjoy'd the Felicity of tho&s;e excellent Laws, which in their own Nature and De&s;ignment are to extend to all the Subjects of the Crown, how Remote &s;oever, at lea&s;t virtually, and wherein the Lives, Liberties and Properties of the Subjects are concerned.</P>
<P>We were very Unea&s;ie under an Arbitrary Commi&s;&s;ion in the late King <HI>James</HI>'s Reign, which gave the Governour of this Province, among other Arbitrary Powers, that of levying Money without calling an A&s;&s;embly, whereby we reckoned that our Lives, as well as E&s;tates, were &s;ubject to the Arbitrary Will of a Governour, contrary to the known Laws of <HI>England</HI>; and Money was actually levyed on us, pur&s;uant to the Illegal Powers of the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ion. The Exerci&s;e whereof, and the dreadful Violence we al&s;o apprehended would be done to our Con&s;ciences, in re&s;pect of our Holy Prote&s;tant Religion, from a <HI>Popi&s;h Arbitrary King,</HI> made Us Unanimou&s;ly and heartily throw off the Yoke of <HI>Popi&s;h Tyranny,</HI> and Declare for his then Highne&s;s the Prince of <HI>ORANGE,</HI> upon the fir&s;t News we had of his Glorious and Unparralled Expedition into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>We acted then, as we conceived, on a Right Principle, and we were the more confirmed in that Belief, becau&s;e we acted in Commerce and Conformity with the Glorious People of <HI>England.</HI> But to our great Amazement and Sorrow we have &s;uffered &s;everely for our early Service to King <HI>William</HI> and the Crown of <HI>England,</HI> mo&s;t of us in our Liberties and E&s;tates, and two of our Friends (who had the Hone&s;ty and Courage to &s;tand in the Gap (when others &s;hamefully drew back and de&s;erted the Prote&s;tant Cau&s;e, and were therefore by Univer&s;al Con&s;ent of the People thought mo&s;t Worthy to be Chief in Command, till Orders &s;hould come from <HI>England</HI>) who fell a Sacrifice to the Rage and Malice of the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Party in this Province, who though few in Number, at that time, had neverthele&s;s the Power and Influence to prevail on the weake&s;t of Men, Coll. <HI>Henry Slaughter,</HI> Go|vernour of this Province, to order a Tryal for tho&s;e brave Men, and appoint &s;uch
<PB N="2" REF="039351_0002_10141E98AEFA4690" MS="y">
a &s;et of Judges, as by Principle and Prejudice, would not fail to gratifie the Malice of their Party, as they did, under a form of Law, which made it the more Cruel and Arbitrary, the &s;aid Tryal being ordered by the Governour, and mannaged by the Bench, contrary to all the Rules of Ju&s;tice and Humanity; for we are able to make appear, if thereunto required, that never a Revolution was carried on and mannaged with more Moderation in any part of the Chri&s;tian World.</P>
<P>And further, to in&s;tance the Weakne&s;s, as well as Cruelty of the &s;aid Governour, in appointing <HI>Nicholas Bayard, William Nicolls</HI> (lately &s;u&s;pended by your Lord&s;hip from his Maje&s;ties Council) and &s;everal others, to mannage, the Tryal again&s;t Capt. <HI>Ley&s;ler,</HI> Mr. <HI>Millbourn,</HI> and the other &s;ix Pri&s;oners, who were all their avowed Enemies, and bore a mortal grudge to the &s;aid Capt. <HI>Ley&s;ler,</HI> for their having been by him im|pri&s;oned in the Fort, for oppo&s;ing the late happy Revolution, and endeavouring to rai&s;e a Tumult among the People, and di&s;turb the Peace of the Government, and for telling Capt. <HI>Ley&s;ler</HI> to his face, That the Parliament of <HI>England</HI> voting and enacting the Thrones being Vacant, was Non-&s;ence, that there was no &s;uch thing po&s;&s;ible in Nature, nor by the Laws of <HI>England.</HI> Governour <HI>Slaughter</HI> too by lodging in <HI>Nicholas Bayards</HI> Hou&s;e, was the more pre&s;&s;ed, and &s;ooner prevailed on by <HI>Bayard</HI>'s Importunity, to &s;ign the Warrant of Execution. And as an infallible token of the &s;hare he had in that Council, there was Flag hung out of a Window of his Hou&s;e for two days together before the day of Execution, as a Trophy and Signal of the Point gained by him on the &s;aid Governour, and of the Victory over the Lives, not only of innocent, but mo&s;t de&s;erving Men. In tho&s;e days it was, when the Prote&s;tant Subjects were Di&s;-armed, and Papi&s;ts Armed; Nay, the publick Faith of Government was Violated; for a Reprieve had been &s;ealed to re&s;pit the Execution of the&s;e Gentlemen, until His Maje&s;ties Plea&s;ure &s;hould be known; yet before this could reach his Maje&s;ty, they were Executed. And notwith&s;tanding the Governours Proclamation to invite &s;uch as fled to &s;hun the &s;ame hard Fate, &s;everal whereof were neverthele&s;s Fined and Impri&s;oned; and certainly more had undergone the hard Fate of Capt. <HI>Ley&s;ler</HI> and Mr. <HI>Millbourn,</HI> had it not been for Governour <HI>Slaughter</HI>'s &s;uddain Death, and the Reflection he had, though too late of this Barbarous and Unwarrant|able &s;trange Execution. This was the end of Capt. <HI>Ley&s;ler</HI> and Mr. <HI>Millbourn,</HI> the former whereof has expended 2700 <HI>l.</HI> out of his own proper E&s;tate, for the Service of his Maje&s;ty. The&s;e were the days of Wrath and utter Darkne&s;s, &s;o that we mu&s;t &s;ay with the Apo&s;tle, <HI>Wo unto them, for they have gone in the way of</HI> Cain.</P>
<P>Then, contrary to his Maje&s;ty's Letters Patents, <HI>Richard Ingoldsby,</HI> a hot headed incon&s;iderate Per&s;on, and only a &s;imple Captain of Foot, is made Commander in Chief; and in all the time of his Admini&s;tration, Oppre&s;&s;ion is &s;till continued. Nor could change of Government remedy the &s;ame, by the coming of Coll. <HI>Fletcher,</HI> who, although no blood &s;pilt, yet brui&s;ed the Bone of the Remnant left, and made his Government an entire ma&s;s of Corruption, by encourageing Pyracy and Unlawful Trade, and giving away almo&s;t all the vacant Lands in the Province, to a few Di&s;|affected and Unde&s;erving Men, neglecting the Fronteers of this Province, and pack|ing Repre&s;entatives to &s;erve in General A&s;&s;embly, imbezeling and &s;quandering away the Revenue, and other Publick Moneys, &s;etting Athei&s;tical Per&s;ons in Places of greate&s;t Tru&s;t in the Government. All which, and many more In&s;tances of his Male-Admini&s;tration, as we are informed, have been already tran&s;mitted to <HI>England</HI> by your Lord&s;hip.</P>
<P>The Repre&s;entatives convened in &s;everal, taking Notice of what was done herein for Relief, by that mo&s;t augu&s;t Senate, the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> in Rever&s;ing of the Attainders of <HI>Jacob Ley&s;ler,</HI> Mr. <HI>Millbourn,</HI> and others, Cannot but with the greate&s;t of Zeal, and fervency of Affection &s;end up their Prayers to the great Maje&s;ty of Heaven and Earth, for the Pre&s;ervation of his Maje&s;ty's Royal Per&s;on, and of that
<PB N="3" REF="039351_0003_10141E9A39965328" MS="y">
mo&s;t excellent Con&s;titution, and for the Mini&s;ters of State, the influence of who&s;e wi&s;e and hone&s;t Council, is felt, even at this va&s;t Di&s;tance from <HI>England.</HI> And in humble Confidence of his Maje&s;ties Goodne&s;s, We humbly pray your Excellency to lay before his Maje&s;ty, this our mo&s;t humble Petition, hoping that the &s;ame good Angel who led your Excellency to attend his Maje&s;ty, when <HI>Prince of Orange,</HI> in his glorious Expedition for <HI>England,</HI> and brought your Excellency &s;afe among&s;t Us, to put a &s;top to the Oppre&s;&s;ions we groaned under, will now move your Lord&s;hip in our behalf, to interceed with his Maje&s;ty for our Relief (although as Chri&s;tians we would forgive our Enemies and Oppre&s;&s;ors) That he would be gratiou&s;ly plea&s;ed to extend of his Royal Bounty and Favour on the Families of the &s;aid <HI>Ley&s;ler</HI> and <HI>Millbourn,</HI> and al&s;o order the &s;aid Sum of two Thou&s;and &s;even Hundred Pounds to be paid unto her, (and that care be taken to pay &s;uch Debts as are owing for what was expended in the late happy Revolution in this Province) in con&s;ideration of their Sufferings and Services for his Maje&s;ties Intere&s;t and this Province.</P>
<P>That for the better Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice two able Judges may be &s;ent from <HI>England,</HI> and two or three able Council, who have acquired to that Noble Profe&s;&s;ion by Study, and not by U&s;urpation, for the Maintenance whereof we &s;hall not be wanting.</P>
<P>That Coll. <HI>Fletcher</HI>'s Coat of Arms may be pulled down from the Kings Chappel in the Fort, and Trinity Church in this City; that &s;ince he left no Monuments of Vi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters"> and a ju&s;t Admini&s;tration, tho&s;e of his Nautious and In&s;upportable Pride and Vanity may not remain to Po&s;terity, e&s;pecially &s;ince his Birth was &s;o mean and ob&s;cure as that he was not entituled to bear a Coat of Arms.</P>
<P>All which the Repre&s;entatives again humbly move your Excellency to lay before his Maje&s;ty, together with our mo&s;t Inviolable Loyalty and Obedience to his Maje&s;tys Command.</P>
