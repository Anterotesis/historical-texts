<P>A REVISAL and correction of "E|ra&s;tus," literally tran&s;lated by a native of Germany, lately arrived in Penn&s;yl|vania, gave ri&s;e to the following piece. The happy &s;implicity of the German original, written in one act by the ce|lebrated Ge&s;ner, &s;ugge&s;ted an enlarge|ment of the plan. A new character is added, &s;ongs are introduced, and the dialogue &s;o modelled, as to be ren|dered (it is pre&s;umed) plea&s;ing to an American ear.</P>

<P>MERCY on me! what is become of Simon? Some bad accident or other has happened to the poor, dear fellow. What &s;hall we do, if he &s;hould never return? No victuals in the hou&s;e; no me&s;&s;enger to go for any, and little, very little mo|ney remaining. I never &s;u&s;pected, when I turn|ed cook, that things would come to this pa&s;s. Our family at times might as well have a coach with a fifth wheel to it, as a cook. Now and then we get a comfortable meal; now and then, I &s;ay. But in general we lead the life of a dog&mdash;hunger and ea&s;e.&mdash;Fal&s;e-hearted Simon! thou wor&s;t of cannibals! thus to de&s;ert ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s, our promi&s;ing young gentleman, and thy own Debby&mdash;The fellow is certainly taking his &s;wing in &s;ome tavern or other, drinking, and gormandizing; or perhaps making love to &s;ome draggled-tail'd&mdash;But I'll match him; I'll match him.</P>

<P>Incomparable woman! how piou&s;ly re&s;igned to, the will of Heaven! Alone, &s;he indulges in the extreme of &s;orrow; but at my approach the &s;miles of conjugal affection add new lu&s;tre to her charms. Joy &s;eems to triumph on her countenance, le&s;t grief &s;hould lour on mine. The wife is &s;tudious to cheer the bo&s;om of her de&s;ponding hu&s;band, whil&s;t the woman and the mother feels internally all the horrors of her &s;ituation. Such virtue is entitled to reward. But as for me, O! that di&s;|tre&s;s were my lot only!&mdash;that I alone were doom|ed to mi&s;ery&mdash;provided that &s;he and my &s;on were happy! Our poverty increa&s;es. Age, accelerated by grief and &s;ickne&s;s, advances with rapid &s;trides. My money is nearly exhau&s;ted; and alas! I have no credit. De&s;erted by my father, from whom can
<PB N="13" REF="022638_0010_0FB9B6911AF0A6F8">
I expect relief? The exertions of my indu&s;try have been de&s;troyed by the late &s;torm. Twelve years have elap&s;ed, &s;ince I entreated forgivene&s;s from my father in a letter fraught with filial con|trition. Alas! can the fault, which I have com|mitted, excu&s;e his &s;everity? Dete&s;ting treachery towards a woman, who united her&s;elf to me in con&s;equence of my mo&s;t &s;olemn promi&s;es, I have di&s;charged the duty of a man of honour, although in &s;o doing I acted contrary to his commands. Not all the glare of riches, not all the pride of dominion, could have &s;oothed the horrors of my mind, had I con&s;igned to obloquy and di&s;grace a woman, who ju&s;tly lays claim to univer&s;al e&s;teem. But let me not de&s;pond. Nature will a&s;|&s;ert her rights, and the heart of my father mu&s;t at length relent. My &s;on approaches! Gracious Heaven! to what mi&s;ery may he not be expo&s;ed! I will conceal my &s;orrow, and a&s;&s;ume the &s;em|blance of contentment, whil&s;t angui&s;h preys upon my heart. Hitherto &s;ecluded from the world, his conver&s;ation is nece&s;&s;arily puerile, but his heart, I tru&s;t, is good, and his under&s;tanding not defective.</P>

&s;o.&mdash;If I am a knave, I am at lea&s;t a well-meaning, prai&s;e-worthy &s;ort of a knave. I have acted from the be&s;t of principles; a wi&s;h to relieve the di&s;tre&s;|&s;ed.

If I had committed this robbery&mdash;I &s;ay, if I had made free with the old gentleman's pur&s;e from bad motives&mdash;why&mdash;it might have been called a robbery. But as I acted from pure, di&s;intere&s;ted motives&mdash;it is no robbe|ry at all; not in the lea&s;t. Intention and circum|&s;tances quite alter the nature of things. I'll be hanged, if there is any crime at all in it. Yet&mdash; I do not know how it happens&mdash;I tremble in eve|ry limb, as if I de&s;erved to be hanged indeed.

I exclaimed, &s;natch me not away in this agony of mind, till I have once more &s;een my &s;on; till I embrace him, and acknowledge to him my inju&s;tice!
