</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SAINT Paul, that illu&s;trious champion of the chri&s;tian cau&s;e, &s;carce ever appears in a more graceful and dignified attitude, than in his occa&s;ional addre&s;&s;es to the great men of his time in defence of the go&s;pel. This ob&s;ervation is eminently verified by his apology before King <HI>Agrippa</HI> in the preceding part of this chapter. His &s;peech on this occa&s;ion is one of the mo&s;t fini&s;hed models of in&s;inuating, yet manly eloquence. It di&s;plays to great advantage the &s;cholar, the gentleman, the chri&s;tian, and the Apo&s;|tle. After paying to the King a tribute of re&s;|pect equally hone&s;t and engaging, he gives him a plain and artle&s;s narrative of his own life; of his &s;trict and devout conver&s;ation, while a Jewi&s;h Phari&s;ee; of his zealous oppo&s;ition to chri&s;tianity, and per&s;ecution of its votaries, in conformity to an erroneous and perverted judgment; of his extraor|dinary
<PB N="6" REF="027775_0004_0FD63D1C140872D0">
conver&s;ion to the faith of Je&s;us, and commi&s;|&s;ion to teach and propagate it both among Jews and Gentiles; and of his con&s;equent labors and &s;uffer|ings in his Ma&s;ter's &s;ervice.</P>
<P>This mode&s;t and &s;erious, yet highly intere&s;ting and wonderful account is rudely interrupted by Fe&s;tus, the Roman Governor of Judea; who loudly ex|claims, "Paul, thou art be&s;ide thy&s;elf, much learn|ing doth make thee mad." As if he had &s;aid, "Paul, thy extravagant di&s;cour&s;e concerning the &s;ufferings and re&s;urrection of one Je&s;us, his appearance and com|mi&s;&s;ion to thee at Dama&s;cus, and the light and &s;alva|tion which the world is to receive from his doctrine, is evidently the offspring of an overheated and di&s;|tracted brain, produced by too inten&s;e &s;tudy of the ancient prophecies and traditions of thy nation."</P>
<P>The text is part of the Apo&s;tle's reply to this un|grounded and indecent charge; I AM NOT MAD, MOST NOBLE FESTUS; BUT SPEAK FORTH THE WORDS OF TRUTH AND SOBERNESS. What inexpre&s;|&s;ible beauty and grandeur &s;urround this temperate, polite, yet re&s;olute an&s;wer! What a delicate and ex|alted triumph does the pri&s;oner at the bar obtain over the in&s;olent madne&s;s of his accu&s;er on the bench of judgment! And what an excellent pattern is here pre&s;ented to the ordinary profe&s;&s;ors and mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel, e&s;pecially at a period, when too many are found attacking chri&s;tianity, and its faithful adherents, with as little candor or decorum, as w<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> exhibited by their noble Predece&s;&s;or!</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="027775_0005_0FD63D1D82F67028">It will not herefore be deemed foreign from the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, if we di&s;tinctly mark both the matter and the &s;pirit of Paul's defence in the text, and apply them as a general directory for all, who are employed in teaching or defending the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>The matter of the Apo&s;tle's reply amounts to a denial of the charge of madne&s;s, and a declaration that his preceding &s;tory was founded in &s;ober truth. The original word tran&s;lated SOBERNESS preci&s;ely &s;ignifies SOUNDNESS OF MIND, and &s;tands directly oppo&s;ed to the mental di&s;traction imputed to the &s;peaker. The words of truth and &s;oberne&s;s, there|fore, intend the declarations of a &s;ound under&s;tanding and an hone&s;t heart; declarations equally pure from fraud, ab&s;urdity, or frantic delu&s;ion.</P>
<P>But what evidence have we that Paul's account of his conver&s;ion and apo&s;tolic function, as well as his general doctrine, agrees with this de&s;cription; that it is not the re&s;ult either of wild enthu&s;ia&s;m, or of wicked impo&s;ture? The que&s;tion is proper and mo|mentous, and has an intimate connexion with the &s;o|lemnity before us. For the extraordinary hi&s;tory and excellent writings of this Apo&s;tle compo&s;e more than half of the New Te&s;tament; and while the former pre&s;ents a &s;hort and convincing proof of the divine truth and power of the go&s;pel, the latter di&s;play its peculiar doctrines in a light far more complete and glorious than any other part of the chri&s;tian can|on. The mini&s;trations, therefore, of our religious teachers, as well as the evangelical exerci&s;es, comforts, and hopes of their faithful hearers, mu&s;t be peculiarly
<PB N="8" REF="027775_0006_0FD63D239EA225D8">
indebted, under God, to his apo&s;tolic labors, and therefore mu&s;t be deeply intere&s;ted in the que&s;tion before us. We likewi&s;e claim a &s;pecial relation to Paul, as the prime mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t to the Gentile nations. On this ground we, as the offspring of heath|en ance&s;tors, view our&s;elves as a part of his peculiar charge, and our chri&s;tian mini&s;ters as his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors and &s;ons in the go&s;pel. While, therefore, we feel a &s;acred obligation to yield a filial re&s;pect to the in|&s;tructions and example of this our APOSTOLIC FATH|ER, we feel our&s;elves equally concerned to vindicate his character from the imputation of fal&s;hood and madne&s;s.</P>
<P>Now that Paul really &s;poke the words of truth and &s;oberne&s;s in the account pre&s;ented in this chapter, and in the general &s;eries of his preaching and writ|ings, is evident from many topics of argument.</P>
<P>In his addre&s;s to King Agrippa, viewed in con|nexion with a preceding &s;imilar &s;peech to his coun|trymen, we find him openly a&s;&s;erting a train of facts, and appealing to the whole nation of the Jews, to their chief prie&s;ts and elders, and finally to his royal judge, for their undeniable truth. The principal facts related were &s;o circum&s;tanced, that their truth or fal&s;ehood mu&s;t have been certainly and generally known. His former rage again&s;t chri&s;tianity, and his &s;udden conver&s;ion to it, with the leading events, which produced, accompanied, and followed that conver&s;ion, mu&s;t, according to his own narration, have been matters of great notoriety. If, there|fore, his account had been fal&s;e, the cheat mu&s;t have
<PB N="9" REF="027775_0007_0FD63D25078E8E18">
been quickly detected and cru&s;hed by the combined te&s;timony of his companions in the memorable jour|ney to Dama&s;cus, of the family in which he fir&s;t lodg|ed in that city, of the per&s;on who is mentioned as the in&s;trument of miraculou&s;ly re&s;toring his &s;ight, and confering upon him extraordinary powers in the name of the Lord Je&s;us, and of tho&s;e, in general, who &s;aw and heard him after the date of his pretended conver&s;ion. Would an impo&s;tor of common under|&s;tanding have openly ri&s;ked his cau&s;e and his life on a &s;tory, the fal&s;ity of which mu&s;t have been in&s;tantly expo&s;ed? Would he have confidently appealed to the tribunal of the public, yea, of his powerful accu&s;|ers and judges, for its manife&s;t truth? Would he have renewed this appeal many years after the com|mencement of his impo&s;ture, when his numerous and &s;agacious foes had long enjoyed every de&s;irable ad|vantage for di&s;covering and defeating it? And would a well informed judge and king have implicitly allow|ed the truth of his account, and the ju&s;tice of his ap|peal, and been almo&s;t per&s;uaded by them to embrace his pretended revelation? The plain &s;en&s;e of every &s;ober man in&s;tantly puts its negative on the&s;e que&s;|tions. Our Apo&s;tle then could not be guilty of de|liberate fraud.</P>
<P>Let us now &s;ee whether his conduct can be ration|ally imputed to enthu&s;ia&s;tic madne&s;s. But this &s;up|po&s;ition is immediately confuted by the &s;uperior wi&s;dom, calmne&s;s, and decency of his language and behavior on this and other trying occa&s;ions, as well as by the general complexion of his actions and writings;
<PB N="10" REF="027775_0008_0FD63D2804BDE5D0">
which di&s;play an extent of knowledge, a &s;oundne&s;s of judgment, a prudence and delicacy of addre&s;s, a &s;pir|it of humility, conde&s;cen&s;ion and charity, totally in|compatible with the uniform features of fanatic delu|&s;ion.</P>
<P>We add that a &s;pirit ot enthu&s;ia&s;m mu&s;t operate on the imagination of its &s;ubject conformably to his pre&s;ent &s;entiments and pa&s;&s;ions. Now the ideas, af|fections, and prejudices of Paul, when he went to Dama&s;cus, were &s;trongly oppo&s;ed to chri&s;tianity; and the extirpation of this hated religion was the fav|orite object of his journey. If in &s;uch a po&s;ture of mind his imagination had pre&s;ented to him a cele&s;tial vi&s;ion, it mu&s;t have been of &s;uch a complexion, as &s;mil|ed upon his pre&s;ent enterpri&s;e, and crowned it with the extraordinary benediction of heaven. A vi&s;ion, therefore, condemning his per&s;ecution of the chri&s;|tians, and leading him in&s;tantly to abjure his former principles and conduct, and to profe&s;s and teach a religion, which, to that moment, he had been eager to de&s;troy, mu&s;t have originated, not from the power of fancy, but from a diviner &s;ource.</P>
<P>We may al&s;o a&s;k tho&s;e free-thinkers, who, with Fe&s;|tus, a&s;cribe this preternatural appearance to the force of a di&s;tempered brain; we may a&s;k them, whether the phren&s;y of one man could in&s;tantly communicate its contagion to a con&s;iderable number of fellow trav|ellers, &s;o as to delude even their bodily &s;en&s;es, at noon-day, into the fancied &s;ight of an extraordinary, overpowering glory, &s;ufficient to &s;trike them all to the ground with amazement and terror? We may
<PB N="11" REF="027775_0009_0FD63D28E4418A38">
further a&s;k, could &s;uch a wild illu&s;ion in&s;pire the mind of Paul with &s;uch a &s;ober and excellent &s;y&s;tem of doctrine, as he afterwards preached? Could it give his preaching and epi&s;tles that tran&s;cendent authority and &s;ucce&s;s, with which they were attended? Could it endow him with &s;upernatural gifts and powers, and enable him in&s;tantly to communicate them to others? It might po&s;&s;ibly, indeed, inve&s;t him with the imagi|nary po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e flattering prerogatives; but his fir&s;t attempt to exert them mu&s;t have cured the plea&s;ing delirium, or at lea&s;t have expo&s;ed his pre|tentions to utter contempt.</P>
<P>The conclu&s;ion, therefore, which forces it&s;elf upon us is, that Paul's account in this chapter is a true and &s;ober &s;tatement of facts, and con&s;equently that the chri&s;tian religion is a divine revelation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>There are but two ways, in which infidelity can po&s;&s;ibly avoid this con|clu&s;ion in favor of the go&s;pel. One is, by pleading that the events which happened to Paul at Dama&s;cus, though admitted to be facts, were not a direct and full proof of chri&s;tianity, nor a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for his ha&s;ty conver&s;ion to it. But let it be con&s;idered that the&s;e facts were not only &s;upernatural, but divine atte&s;tations to the mi&s;&s;ion and doctrine of Chri&s;t. For, in the fir&s;t place, Paul and his company &s;aw a <HI>heavenly light</HI> or <HI>&s;hining cloud,</HI> which among the Jews was the known &s;ymbol of JEHOVAH'S pre&s;ence, and was &s;tyl|ed the <HI>Sheebinah,</HI> or the <HI>glory of the Lord.</HI> Accordingly, they all fell on their faces, not only through terror, but as an u&s;ual token of re&s;pect to &s;uch a di|vine manife&s;tation. Secondly, Paul &s;aw a glorious human form in this cloud, and heard a voice i&s;&s;uing from it, which a&s;&s;ured him that the per&s;on thus ap|pearing and &s;peaking was Je&s;us of Nazareth, and that the oppo&s;ition then made to chri&s;tianity was a per&s;ecution of him&s;elf. Thus Paul had &s;en&s;ible demon&s;tration of the pre&s;ence and divine glory of the ri&s;en Redeemer, and of the truth and divinity of his go&s;pel. Thirdly, he was &s;truck blind by this glorious light, and, in an&s;wer to his prayer to Je&s;us of Nazareth, was miraculou&s;|ly cured by one of his di&s;ciples &s;ent to him for that purpo&s;e. Fourthly, his under&s;tanding was &s;upernaturally in&s;pired with a complete knowledge of the chri&s;tian doctrine; his heart was wonderfully changed by its influence; and his bapti&s;m into this new religion was attended with an extraordinary ef|fu&s;ion of the Holy Gho&s;t, preparing him to preach, confirm, and defend the go&s;pel in the mo&s;t convincing and &s;ucce&s;sful manner. Surely this aggregate of divine te&s;timonies in favor of chri&s;tianity was abundantly &s;ufficient to con|vince any rational mind of its heavenly original. The evidence which our religion derives from the extraordinary conver&s;ion of Paul will &s;trike us with additional force, if we attend to his character, &s;ituation, and pro&s;pects, before that event; his &s;uperior &s;en&s;e and learning, integrity and devotion; his pop|ularity and influence among the Jews: his remarkable attachment to their religion, and incredulity re&s;pecting the chri&s;tian; of con&s;equence, his va&s;t &s;acrifices both of a worldly and religious nature, and voluntary expo&s;|ure of him&s;elf to the mo&s;t terrible evils, by profe&s;&s;ing and preaching the go&s;pel. To all which we may add his ardent, laborious and per&s;ever|ing zeal in this new profe&s;&s;ion, joined with con&s;tant proofs of an excellent under&s;tanding and heart; together with the &s;erene fortitude, elevation, and joy in&s;pired by his religion amid extraordinary trials both in life and in death. The&s;e circum&s;tances, combined with the unparalleled credit and happy effects of his doctrine in his own and &s;uccceding generations, furni&s;h the mo&s;t illu&s;|trious and &s;atisfactory proof of the truth and power of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>The only re&s;ource, therefore, left to the oppo&s;ers of revelation is the plea, that the&s;e pretended facts relative to Paul are an <HI>after forgery.</HI> But, not to in&s;i&s;t on the common and ju&s;t ob&s;ervation, that this pre&s;ence &s;ets a&s;ide every principle, by which ancient facts and writings can be authenticated, it may &s;uffice to remark that it involves the ab&s;urd and incredible &s;uppo&s;ition, that within about a century after Chri&s;t's a&s;cen&s;ion a very large proportion of the chri&s;tian churches were made to believe that they were originally planted by the preaching and miracles of Paul, and had received from him extraordi|nary gifts and in&s;pired letters, when there was no foundation in truth for &s;uch a belief; yea, that the whole chri&s;tian world was deluded into a per&s;ua&s;ion that it had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, from the beginning, an authentic hi&s;tory of the conver|&s;ion, travels and &s;ucce&s;sful labors of this Apo&s;tle, written by his contemporary Luke, when it could not but know that it had never &s;een nor heard of &s;uch a hi&s;tory, till the &s;uppo&s;ed forgery appeard!</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="027775_0010_0FD63D2C85BEFA50">If we now direct our attention to the general DOCTRINE of chri&s;tianity, as preached by this Apo&s;|tle, and the other extraordinary mini&s;ters of the go&s;|pel, we find it admirably corre&s;ponding with the de|&s;cription before us. We behold in it a &s;y&s;tem of truths rational and practical, intere&s;ting and &s;ublime. It harmonizes with the be&s;t dictates of our own un|der&s;tandings.
<PB N="13" REF="027775_0011_0FD63D2D67BEB2A8">
It &s;uits the various exigencies of our lap&s;ed condition. It confirms the wi&s;hes, hopes, and fears of nature, by annexing pardon to repentance, a future reward to &s;incere though imperfect holine&s;s, and final mi&s;ery to impenitent vice. It at once en|lightens and purifies, humbles and con&s;oles, &s;trength|ens and exalts the mind of man. This excellent &s;pi|rit, this ennobling and comforting operation of the chri&s;tian doctrine, and its wonderful agreement with the mo&s;t refined &s;entiments and feelings of the virtu|ous heart, are an internal and mo&s;t delightful evi|dence of its truth. This evidence is exceedingly heightened by the apparent candor, &s;implicity and goodne&s;s of the writers of the New Te&s;tament, and by the general meanne&s;s of their previous condition, ed|ucation, and capacities, compared with the &s;triking grandeur, originality, and perfection of the &s;y&s;tem, which their writings unfold.</P>
<P>The peculiar MODE, in which the go&s;pel commu|nicates its in&s;truction, is equally accommodated to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of man with the doctrine it&s;elf. It teaches and enforces its truths, not by nice philo&s;o|phical explications and rea&s;onings, which few could under&s;tand, but by plain and &s;triking facts; by &s;uch facts as not only prove the divine mi&s;&s;ion of the teacher, and thus give his me&s;&s;age a peculiar author|ity and influence over the human mind, but al&s;o ex|emplify his doctrines in a familiar and vi&s;ible man|ner. It pre&s;ents &s;piritual truths to the &s;en&s;es and imaginations of men, not only by dre&s;&s;ing them in imagery borrowed from &s;en&s;ible objects, but by giv|ing
<PB N="14" REF="027775_0012_0FD63D30521E2F00">
them a pre&s;ent or anticipated exi&s;tence in vi&s;ible examples. Thus it exemplifies the power of Chri&s;t to forgive &s;ins by the open exerci&s;e of that power in delivering men from the &s;en&s;ible penal effects of tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion. It illu&s;trates his ability and readine&s;s to cure the mo&s;t inveterate di&s;ea&s;es of the mind, and to emancipate it from the tyranny of &s;atan, by his mi|raculou&s;ly healing analogous and equally ob&s;tinate di&s;tempers of the body, and relea&s;ing it from the pow|er of malignant &s;pirits. It confirms the great doctrine of the final re&s;urrection by in&s;tances of dead per&s;ons re&s;tored to life. It illu&s;trates and a&s;certains the fu|ture glorious re&s;urrection and reward of the faithful by the public triumphant ri&s;ing and a&s;cen&s;ion of their Head, and by his repeated appearances in his glorifi|ed humanity to &s;everal of his primitive mini&s;ters. It clothes even the nature and perfections of the DEI|TY with a kind of vi&s;ible body, in the per&s;on, char|acter, and works of his Son; in&s;omuch that the di&s;|cour&s;es and miracles of the Savior, joined with the leading traits of his temper and deportment, are an expre&s;s repre&s;entation, a mild and &s;oftened refulgence of the divine glory. It elucidates and enforces its moral precepts by the perfect life of its Founder, which was at once a familiar exhibition of the moral excel|lence of God, and a complete and mo&s;t engaging pat|tern of tho&s;e virtues, which adorn and con&s;ummate the character of man.</P>
<P>As the internal con&s;titution of chri&s;tianity exhib|its &s;uch genuine characters of divine wi&s;dom and be|nevolence; &s;o its external evidence is a plain and
<PB N="15" REF="027775_0013_0FD63D3361253AC0">
convincing appeal to all &s;ober and hone&s;t inquirers. When, in the gla&s;s of authentic go&s;pel hi&s;tory, we &s;ee the Author of our religion, by one powerful word, calming the boi&s;terous elements, and giving &s;ight, health, life, to the blind, the &s;ick, and the dead, we behold exertions of the &s;ame power and &s;overeign dominion, which created and governs the world; and thus have &s;en&s;ible demon&s;tration both that there is a God, and that the chri&s;tian revelation is his offspring. When we contemplate the va&s;t &s;y&s;tem of prophecy di&s;played in the Bible, a &s;y&s;tem which embraces the general train of events from the beginning to the end of the world, and &s;ee many branches of it exactly accompli&s;hed; we have a vi&s;ible proof both that the volume of &s;cripture and the events of the univer&s;e are the work of one all-comprehending mind, and meet in one harmonious and mighty plan, and that the remaining parts of the prophetic &s;cheme, which re|&s;pect the future &s;cenes of time and of eternity, will, in their proper order, be punctually verified.</P>
<P>Having con&s;idered the matter of Paul's declaration, let us &s;ee how far it concerns chri&s;tian mini&s;ters in general, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent age.</P>
<P>To vindicate and recommend the go&s;pel as a ration|al and divine &s;y&s;tem mu&s;t ever be a main branch of the mini&s;terial function. A &s;ingular combination of circum&s;tances renders a careful attention to this ob|ject peculiarly &s;ea&s;onable and momentous at the pre|&s;ent day. The revival and progre&s;s of free inquiry, of human and divine &s;cience, of civil and &s;acred lib|erty, have, in many in&s;tances, been accompanied with
<PB N="16" REF="027775_0014_0FD63D34479E4970">
a ha&s;ty and extreme contempt of e&s;tabli&s;hed religious opinions and forms as &s;uper&s;titious or fanatical, and by too ea&s;y a tran&s;ition, of the chri&s;tian religion and prie&s;thood in general, as the production either of cunning ambition or of enthu&s;ia&s;tic folly. This un|happy feature eminently marks the pre&s;ent counte|nance of a great part of the old world, and begins to be vi&s;ible in the face of the new. To this we may add, the late pro&s;perous &s;tate of our country has, by furn|i&s;hing the means, given birth and nouri&s;hment to an exce&s;&s;ive ta&s;te for worldly &s;plendor, amu&s;ement, and &s;en&s;ual indulgence, and to various forms of impiety and corruption; and thus, by natural con&s;equence, has produced a vigorous and too &s;ucce&s;sful effort to con|form the religious and moral principles of the age to its proud and vicious propen&s;ities. It is, therefore, of peculiar importance that the clergy of the pre&s;ent day &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s an accurate and familiar acquaint|ance with the ground on which they &s;tand, with the nature, evidence, and mutual connexion of natural and revealed religion; that they may be able to ex|plain, defend and enforce them to the greate&s;t advan|tage. Now as the religion of nature is be&s;t &s;upport|ed by appealing to the manife&s;t con&s;titution and cour&s;e of things in the &s;y&s;tem around us; &s;o perhaps the mo&s;t ea&s;y and &s;uce&s;sful method of defending chri&s;|tianity, at lea&s;t of &s;atisfying or &s;ilencing the bulk of inquirers, is by appealing to pre&s;ent notorious facts. I humbly conceive that the whole evidence of revealed religion may be happily reduced to this &s;ingle to|pic. For</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="027775_0015_0FD63D344D441288">Why do we credit the te&s;timony of tho&s;e witne&s;&s;es, who have publi&s;hed the extraordinary facts of the go&s;|pel? It is becau&s;e our own con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s and daily ob&s;ervation a&s;&s;ure us of the credibility of human te&s;|timony &s;o circum&s;tanced, and of the &s;afety and nece&s;|&s;ity of acting upon it in our mo&s;t weighty concerns. From what we con&s;tantly feel in our&s;elves, and ob|&s;erve in others, we know that it is incompatible with human nature voluntarily to profe&s;s, act, and &s;uffer, as many thou&s;ands of chri&s;tian converts did in the fir&s;t days of the go&s;pel, unle&s;s they were certain of its miraculous proofs. The pre&s;ent exi&s;tence and reputation of the evangelic hi&s;tory &s;o many ages after its fir&s;t publication, and the many monuments of its truth &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting among us, are &s;tanding public atte&s;tations of its claim to our belief. The exi&s;tence of a chri&s;tian Sabbath, and of a &s;acramental fea&s;t, in memory of the crucified and ri&s;en Savior, and of a &s;elect order of men to feed and rule his flock, can never be accounted for on any other principle than the truth of tho&s;e facts, which the&s;e in&s;titutions proclaim.</P>
<P>If the evidence of ancient &s;criptural facts may be thus re&s;olved into pre&s;ent appearances, much more may the proof ari&s;ing from prophecy. When we be|hold the obvious agreement of the pre&s;ent, as well as pa&s;t &s;tate of the church and world with the predictions of the Bible, particularly, with re&s;pect to the &s;ingular character and &s;tate of the Jews, the extraordinary pre&s;ervation of the chri&s;tian intere&s;t, the decline and fa&s;t approaching de&s;truction of Antichri&s;t, and the
<PB N="18" REF="027775_0016_0FD63D3572F4A5B0">
manife&s;t preparations of divine providence for a fu|ture more glorious epoch in the hi&s;tory of man&punc; we have, as was hinted above, a &s;en&s;ible demon&s;tration of the divinity both of tho&s;e prophetic repre&s;entations, and of the general &s;y&s;tem to which they belong.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent exi&s;tence and beneficent influence of chri&s;tianity in a con&s;iderable part of the world, com|pared with the fate and &s;ucce&s;s of other in&s;titutions in ancient or modern times, are another &s;tanding proof of its divine original: for no other adequate cau&s;e can be a&s;&s;igned either for its fir&s;t and general reception, its permanent e&s;tabli&s;hment, or its unriv|alled efficacy in meliorating the religions, moral, and civil &s;tate of mankind.</P>
<P>Finally, the exi&s;tence of the Bible it&s;elf is another important fact, which proclaims its divinity. For the a&s;pect of this book, at fir&s;t view, is peculiar and noble. Its narrations, characters, and whole contex|ture have the natural air of truth. Its &s;tyle or man|ner, like that of the volume of creation, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a &s;implicity, an unaffected charm and maje&s;ty, which have never been equalled. The plainne&s;s and par|ticularity of its hi&s;tory; the circum&s;tantial variations, yet important agreement of its writers; their con&s;pi|cuous humility, integrity, benevolence, and piety, compared with their &s;olemn preten&s;ions to a divine commi&s;&s;ion; above all, the character of Je&s;us Chri&s;t as drawn in the New Te&s;tament; a character &s;o orig|inal and &s;o perfect, that the &s;imple and unlettered penmen could not of them&s;elves have imagined any thing like it, much le&s;s have uniformly &s;upported its
<PB N="19" REF="027775_0017_0FD63D3708CBD0D8">
dignity, and therefore mu&s;t have copied it from real life; a character, who&s;e whole complexion is remote from every appearance both of enthu&s;ia&s;m and impo&s;|ture; the &s;ingular matter, &s;pirit, and dre&s;s of our Savior's di&s;cour&s;es, joined with the fini&s;hed &s;cheme of truth and duty delivered by him and his Apo&s;tles; the&s;e, and many other facts, involved in the exi&s;tence of the Bible, con&s;tantly appeal to our under&s;tandings and hearts for its truth and divinity.</P>
<P>As chri&s;tianity at large may thus be ea&s;ily &s;up|ported by pointing the &s;en&s;es, rea&s;on, and moral feel|ings of men to a train of pre&s;ent appearances; &s;o its leading doctrines, duties, and &s;anctions may be be&s;t recommended and enforced by &s;imilar methods, or by repre&s;entations, which, as far as the &s;ubject will admit, carry in them an appeal to the &s;ound dictates, or the evident experience of the human mind. Per|mit me mode&s;tly to illu&s;trate this remark by particu|lar examples.</P>
<P>The go&s;pel &s;uppo&s;es and a&s;&s;erts the condition of our fallen nature to be a &s;tate of deplorable ignorance, corruption, and guilt; a &s;tate, in which natural light and mere law can neither &s;atisfy the inquring mind, relieve the accu&s;ing con&s;cience, nor purify the cor|rupted heart. This repre&s;entation of human deprav|ity and mi&s;ery is the ba&s;is of the evangelical &s;cheme of mercy. But it is not peculiar to revelation. It is matter of con&s;tant experience and ob&s;ervation. It is &s;anctioned by the univer&s;al hi&s;tory of man. It is echoed by the plaintive acknowledgments of the be&s;t human charcters. The chri&s;tian mini&s;ter, therefore,
<PB N="20" REF="027775_0018_0FD63D3C77233C00">
will carefully &s;tate and enforce this humiliating truth, and thus hold up to the con&s;ciences of his hearers a faithful mirror, in which every de&s;cription of human &s;inners may &s;ee its own likene&s;s, and be properly alarmed and humbled at the &s;ight. At the &s;ame time he will aim at &s;uch a &s;ober repre&s;entation of hu|man nature, as may neither impeach the moral char|acter of its author, nor contradict the voice of daily experience; as may not &s;eem to injure or to leave out a great part of mankind, or to di&s;courage convict|ed di&s;tre&s;&s;ed offenders from &s;eeking needed and offer|ed relief.</P>
<P>That God has &s;ent his ONLY BEGOTTEN SON into our world, to enlighten and reform, to comfort and &s;ave it, is another mo&s;t important truth delivered in the go&s;pel, a truth which con&s;titutes its di&s;tingui&s;hing glory. The &s;acred writers plainly a&s;&s;ert the divine dignity of the Savior, his real and miraculous incarna|tion, the atoning virtue of his obedience and death, his glorious exaltation, and his important offices as Teacher and Advocate, as Ruler and Judge of the world. It becomes the chri&s;tian mini&s;ter to pre&s;ent the&s;e doctrines in their native &s;criptural dre&s;s, in their weighty practical import; not as a curious chain of metaphy&s;ical &s;peculations, but as intere&s;ting facts plainly declared in the in&s;pired hi&s;tory, and forming a grand &s;cheme of providence for accom|pli&s;hing the mo&s;t glorious and benevolent purpo&s;es. The air of wonderful incomprehen&s;ible grandeur, or of unfathomable coun&s;el and operation, which &s;ur|rounds the&s;e facts, gives them a more &s;triking corre&s;|pondence
<PB N="21" REF="027775_0019_0FD63D3E3739F468">
to the general nature and works of the in|finite Being, as well as to the exigences of apo&s;tate man, which required an in&s;tructor, a reformer, a re|conciling &s;acrifice, far &s;uperior to any which the world had previou&s;ly known.</P>
<P>The re&s;toration of our di&s;ordered minds to moral harmony, purity and joy by the agency of a DIVINE SANCTIFIER, AND COMFORTER, is another branch of this revealed plan of providence. In explaining this momentous point the &s;ober in&s;tructor will place the nece&s;&s;ity, the manner, and the fruits of this &s;uper|natural agency in a light, which may give it a mo&s;t rational and comforting a&s;pect; which may encour|age the humble activity of the creature, while it fixes his dependence on the proffered gracious influence of the Creator.</P>
<P>In &s;tating and enforcing the duties of chri&s;tianity the evangelical teacher will point out their intimate connexion with its doctrines. He will &s;how that the&s;e duties, even &s;uch of them as are mo&s;t peculiar, immediately re&s;ult from tho&s;e facts or relations, which the go&s;pel reveals, and in this view are nece&s;&s;ary branches of moral virtue or natural obligation; and con&s;equently that the &s;erious and fervent practice of them is requi&s;ite both to evidence and promote a tru|ly hone&s;t and excellent character. On this ground he will illu&s;trate the e&s;&s;ential fitne&s;s and importance of &s;upreme love to God, cordial faith in the Mediator, grateful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the &s;anctifying Spirit, humility and repentance for &s;in, tender and beneficent affection to one another, con&s;tant ardor, elevation, and joy in
<PB N="22" REF="027775_0020_0FD63D3E40750CD8">
the pur&s;uit and pro&s;pect of chri&s;tian perfection and glory. He will ju&s;tify inward vital chri&s;tianity, in its highe&s;t exerci&s;es and enjoyments, from the imput|ation of weakne&s;s or phrenzy, by the un&s;peakable magnitude of its objects and motives, as well as by the peculiar condition and frame of its &s;ubjects, who&s;e affections, as well as under&s;tandings, may with rea&s;on be &s;upremely engaged by &s;uch &s;uitable, intere&s;ting, and glorious di&s;coveries as the go&s;pel pre&s;ents. On the &s;ame principles will he vindicate the zeal of faithful mini&s;ters in pre&s;&s;ing the&s;e truths and duties on their fellow &s;inners and chri&s;tians. In a word, he will &s;how that every part of go&s;pel morality is ra|tional and noble, and directly conducive to our pre&s;|ent and future felicity. He will repre&s;ent even the ceremonial duties of our religion as expre&s;&s;ive &s;igns and powerful in&s;truments of good moral di&s;po&s;itions, as well as important to the exigence of a vi&s;ible church and of public chri&s;tian wor&s;hip, which are &s;o bene|ficial to the civil and moral &s;tate of human &s;ociety, and &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the nurture and preparation of individuals for a nobler and happier exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Finally, he will repre&s;ent the &s;anctions of the go&s;|pel, drawn from a future endle&s;s retribution, as but a louder echo to the voice of natural equity, of com|mon rea&s;on and experience, and as benevolently adapted to &s;eize the mo&s;t powerful &s;prings of human activity, and engage them in the cau&s;e of virtue and immortality.</P>
<P>Having largely contemplated the matter of mini&s;|terial duty, let us briefly advert to the SPIRIT or
<PB N="23" REF="027775_0021_0FD63D3F3AE291D8">
MANNER, in which it &s;hould be performed. Of this we have a noble pattern in the text. The &s;everal beauties of this model &s;hould be &s;tudiou&s;ly copied by all &s;ucceeding mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>Like Paul, they &s;hould be examples of chri&s;tian CIVILITY. As he gives to Fe&s;tus the honorary title of his office, and addre&s;&s;es him in a &s;tyle of decent and manly re&s;pect; &s;o it becomes his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors care|fully to exhibit, in their &s;ocial intercou&s;e, the courte|ous &s;pirit of their religion, by treating the various cla&s;&s;es of men agreeably to the innocent forms of civil decorum, and pre&s;erving on all occa&s;ions that mild, humble, unaffected dignity, which will neither flatter the greate&s;t, nor trample upon the lowe&s;t of human beings.</P>
<P>With this &s;hould be united a certain INDEPEN|DENT FIRMNESS AND MAGNANIMITY. As Paul's &s;ingle aim was to honor his ma&s;ter and &s;ave the &s;ouls of men, &s;o the grandeur of his object communicated an habitual elevation to his &s;entiments and conduct, and rendered them nobly &s;uperior to all worldly con|&s;iderations. The pro&s;pect or experience of ridicule, per&s;ecution, or the greate&s;t temporal evils, far from damping, rather gave new vigor to his chri&s;tian hero|i&s;m. Unawed by the pre&s;ence or oppo&s;ite principles of an augu&s;t and brilliant auditory, in which a King pre&s;ided, he gives them the &s;ame hone&s;t account of his conver&s;ion and doctrine, which he had before de|livered to the Jewi&s;h populace, and with &s;teady cour|age maintains the truth, when reproached and derided by a Governor. The &s;ame greatne&s;s of &s;oul marks
<PB N="24" REF="027775_0022_0FD63D40B9FD5640">
his behavior before Felix, when called to addre&s;s him as a chri&s;tian preacher. In&s;tead of gratifying his cu|rious ta&s;te, or courting his applau&s;e and protection, though his temporal freedom and comfort were in his power, he with equal dexterity and magnanimity points out the evil of tho&s;e vices, to which that Ma|gi&s;trate was notoriou&s;ly addicted, enforces his admo|nitions by the terrors of a judgment to come, and applies his &s;ubject with &s;uch authority, as to make Felix tremble on the &s;eat of judgment! What a glo|rious pattern for the clergy of the pre&s;ent day! A con&s;iderable portion of the &s;ame independent and re&s;|olute &s;pirit is e&s;&s;ential to their fidelity. Without it they will be apt to keep back unpalatable truths and duties however important, and to &s;pare the favor|ite vices of their hearers, e&s;pecially of tho&s;e, on who&s;e &s;miles their temporal circum&s;tances chiefly depend.</P>
<P>But this inflexible firmne&s;s mu&s;t ever be tempered with BENIGNITY AND LOVE. The courage of our Apo&s;tle was the effect, not of a fierce unfeeling tem|per, but of tender and ardent good-will to his breth|ren of mankind. What an effu&s;ion of generous and glowing benevolence is his reply to King Agrippa, who had profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf almo&s;t per&s;uaded to become a chri&s;tian, I WOULD TO GOD, THAT NOT ONLY THOU, BUT ALSO ALL THAT HEAR ME THIS DAY WERE BOTH ALMOST AND ALTOGETHER SUCH AS I AM EXCEPT THESE BONDS! Nothing can be more congenial or more e&s;&s;ential to the employment of a chri&s;tian mini&s;ter than this fervent charity. This will animate and &s;weeten, recommend and enforce
<PB N="25" REF="027775_0023_0FD63D434D57AA28">
his public and private labors, will draw forth his con|de&s;cending pa&s;toral offices to the young, the poor, and afflicted of his flock and &s;tudiou&s;ly accomodate his mini&s;trations to their various capacities, tempers, and conditions. Which leads us to add that</P>
<P>PRUDENCE is another &s;triking trait in the de&s;crip|tion of a go&s;pel teacher. Saint Paul ever paid a wi&s;e and delicate attention to the proper decorum and dignity of his character. To this end he maintained a &s;trict di&s;cipline over his pa&s;&s;ions which were natural|ly ardent, nicely attended to characters, places, and circum&s;tances, and &s;kilfully adapted him&s;elf to the diver&s;ified prejudices and infirmities of mankind, that by the&s;e handles, he might, if po&s;&s;ible, draw them over to the &s;tandard of Chri&s;t. His &s;edate and wi&s;e deportment recorded in this chapter, his delicate and ma&s;terly addre&s;s to the Athenians, his accommodating behavior both to Jews and Gentiles, to the weak and the &s;trong, furni&s;h a very in&s;tructive example of that laudable mini&s;terial prudence, which aims to plea&s;e men in order to profit them, which by hon|orable conde&s;cen&s;ions and &s;acrifices &s;eeks general favor and e&s;teem merely as an engine of exten&s;ive u&s;eful|ne&s;s, while it &s;corns tho&s;e ver&s;atile popular arts, which &s;acrifice the approbation of God and of con|&s;cience to the idol of unmerited human applau&s;e.</P>
<P>With this prudence &s;hould be joined a WELL TEMPERED ZEAL for chri&s;tianity and its important truths. This eminently di&s;tingui&s;hes Paul's defence in this chapter, as well as the whole tenor of his min|i&s;terial conduct. His zeal every where burns and
<PB N="26" REF="027775_0024_0FD63D44B920F060">
&s;hines; but, it is with a clear and gentle flame. The mo&s;t in&s;olent or cruel attacks from the enemies of the go&s;pel could not provoke him to bitter recrimina|tion. He employs no other weapons to defend and propagate his ma&s;ter's cau&s;e, but tho&s;e of in&s;truction, argument, and per&s;ua&s;ion, enforced by an exemplary chri&s;tian life. Happy had it been for the church and the world if the chri&s;tian prie&s;thood, and other defenders of the faith, had always contented them|&s;elves with the &s;ame mode of procedure! Our reli|gion, far from either needing or countenancing, con|demns and &s;purns all intolerant and compul&s;ory mea&s;ures. She requires her public officers indeed, to &s;upport her cau&s;e with earne&s;tne&s;s and vigor; but at the &s;ame time with that noble moderation and ten|derne&s;s, which &s;uit her genius and principles, which are due to her more decent or wavering oppo&s;ers, and which prudence and compa&s;&s;ion demand even to her &s;coffing and virulent foes.</P>
<P>In a word, a SUBLIME SPIRIT OF CHRISTIAN PIE|TY is the crowning feature in the character before us. Paul's heart was &s;ubjected to the go&s;pel and ac|quainted with its important ble&s;&s;ings, before he was &s;ent forth to preach it to others. This intimate and comforting knowledge of its nature and value gave a &s;uperior lu&s;tre and energy to his addre&s;&s;es, and &s;pread over his whole life a &s;avor of rational, fervent, and elevated piety. There is no qualification &s;o im|portant to a go&s;pel mini&s;ter as a high degree of per|&s;onal religion. This will enable him to delineate and recommend chri&s;tianity to others in a ju&s;t and
<PB N="27" REF="027775_0025_0FD63D44D1B11550">
engaging light. It will clothe the compo&s;ition and delivery of his public di&s;cour&s;es with a natural warmth and &s;olemnity, equally remote from cold &s;peculation or artificial parade on the one hand, and from a blind and turbulent zeal on the other. At the &s;ame time it will render his private deport|ment in the view of his family and flock a continual tran&s;cript and enforcement of his public mini&s;tra|tions.</P>
<P>What an excellent pattern is here to direct the preparatory &s;tudies and views of young gentlemen, who contemplate the chri&s;tian mini&s;try as their fu|ture profe&s;&s;ion!</P>
<P>It is of va&s;t importance, my friends, that you lay a firm and adequate foundation for the high employ|ment before you. Study clo&s;ely, then, the great evi|dences, principles, and obligations of religion, as ex|hibited both by nature and revelation. Let your belief of the&s;e truths be rational and your acquaint|ance with them comprehen&s;ive, experimental, and practical. Lay open your hearts, as well as under|&s;tandings, to the pure and elevating influence of the chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem. Let your motives in undertaking to preach it comport with its heavenly origin, con&s;ti|tution and end. Let not the views of &s;ecular intere&s;t or di&s;tinction, of popular fame, nor even of refined mental entertainment, or literary eminence, draw you to this holy profe&s;&s;ion. If you embrace it on &s;uch principles, your conduct will not be marked either with truth or &s;obriety. The &s;pirit of the office is violated, and its dignity betrayed by the unworthy
<PB N="28" REF="027775_0026_0FD63D4B421F4DF0">
views and behavior of tho&s;e, who thus pre&s;umptu|ou&s;ly invade it. Certainly characters of eminent &s;e|riou&s;ne&s;s and integrity, firmne&s;s and zeal, as well as knowledge and prudence, are required to recommend and promote chri&s;tianity, and to bear down the &s;o|phi&s;try and ridicule of its adver&s;aries, in this enlight|ened, &s;ceptical, and di&s;&s;olute age. You will therefore, my young brethren, deliberately count the co&s;t of this employment, as well as duly appreciate the honor and plea&s;ure, the per&s;onal improvement, the pre&s;ent u&s;efulne&s;s, and future reward, which are connected with its able and faithful execution.</P>
<P>In the&s;e ob&s;ervations, my dear Sir, I have the plea&s;ure of expre&s;&s;ing your &s;entiments, as well as my own. Our late intimate connexion at a neighboring univer&s;ity has given me acce&s;s to your general ideas and feelings re&s;pecting the chri&s;tian religion and min|i&s;try, as well as a lively intere&s;t in every event, which concerns either your happine&s;s or u&s;efulne&s;s. I fe|licitate you on the di&s;tingui&s;hed honor which provi|dence has done you in crowning your probationary &s;ervices from the de&s;k with the early voice of gener|al approbation, and in directing the fir&s;t de&s;titute &s;o|ciety which has had the opportunity of enjoying them to &s;o united an election of you to the pa&s;toral office. I congratulate you that your de&s;tined lot is ca&s;t in this ancient and re&s;pectable metropolis, which concenters &s;o large a portion of American learn|ing and information, refinement and magnificence. At the &s;ame time your &s;ituation here, with its plea&s;|ures and advantages will combine &s;ome peculiar and
<PB N="29" REF="027775_0027_0FD63D4B454A33C8">
delicate trials, which will give ample exerci&s;e, both to your prudence and virtue. To enjoy the decent plea&s;ures, to improve the advantages, and &s;urmount the temptations of this populous and elegant town in a manner becoming the chri&s;tian mini&s;ter, will re|quire a great &s;hare of that divine philo&s;ophy, which is learned only in the &s;chool of Chri&s;t. By daily and devoutly conver&s;ing with the &s;ublime truths, exam|ples, and pro&s;pects which his go&s;pel pre&s;ents, and keeping in realizing view the grand and intere&s;ting de&s;ign of the chri&s;tian mini&s;try, you will be able, through divine grace, to maintain the &s;pirit of your &s;tation and to carry it not only into your public exhi|bitions, but into the more private and cheerful &s;cenes of life. This will place you on a &s;ecure and noble emi|nence above the infectious and corrupting influence of earthly &s;plendor, wealth or amu&s;ement. At the &s;ame time it will enable you to enjoy every proper &s;ource of entertainment in a manner truly rational and refined. It will al&s;o prompt and direct your tender and a&s;&s;iduous efforts to remove the veil from the eyes of tho&s;e, who are blinded and en&s;laved by the glittering trifles of this world, and bring them to perceive and embrace the divine and immortal hap|pine&s;s, which chri&s;tianity confers on her humble di&s;|ciples.</P>
<P>While in the light of the go&s;pel and of eternity you view all men as brethren and equals, as joint &s;harers in the guilt and danger of &s;in, and in the provi&s;ion and offer of &s;aving mercy, you will extend the offices of brotherly and pa&s;toral affection to all cla&s;&s;es of
<PB N="30" REF="027775_0028_0FD63D4CB7065D60">
your people; you will feel your&s;elf a debtor to the poor and the ignorant, as well as to the more wealthy and refined. While you pay a &s;uitable re&s;pect to the pre&s;ent improved &s;tate of &s;ociety, and to the ta&s;te of elegant and literary characters, you will remember that the great object of the chri&s;tian mini&s;ter is not to plea&s;e or to &s;hine, but to make his hearers good and happy. To accompli&s;h this effect; upon &s;uch a va&s;t a&s;&s;emblage of different &s;ubjects, as center in this capital, mu&s;t demand the greate&s;t exerci&s;e of wi&s;e and conde&s;cending fidelity; it mu&s;t require the alternate application of very different modes of in|&s;truction and per&s;ua&s;ion; it mu&s;t call for a clear and powerful inculcation of all the important doctrines, precepts, and motives of our holy religion.</P>
<P>In defending the go&s;pel again&s;t the attacks of infi|delity, which in a place &s;o populous and expo&s;ed are to be peculiarly expected, you will ob&s;erve a happy medium between a timid or unbounded complai&s;ance, and a rude unhallowed zeal. You will carefully aim, on every occa&s;ion, that both your doctrine, &s;pirit, and deportment may be a con&s;tant recommendation and defence of chri&s;tianity by exhibiting it in its na|tive &s;weetne&s;s, &s;obriety, and dignity.</P>
<P>Among other weighty and encouraging incentives to this honorable and u&s;eful conduct, I might point your attention to that cloud of witne&s;&s;es, to that glo|rious company of chri&s;tian mini&s;ters, which di&s;tin|gui&s;hed the fir&s;t and be&s;t days of the go&s;pel. I might bring up to your view a train of re&s;pectable clergy|men who have adorned, or &s;till illuminate the churches

of this town. I might remind you of many excellent characters among the laity in this place, who are open and un&s;haken friends to primitive chri&s;tianity, who revere its doctrines, in&s;titutions, and morals, and &s;incerely honor the per&s;ons and mini&s;trations of its faithful in&s;tructors. Above all, let me direct your eyes to the APOSTLE AND HIGH PRIEST OF OUR PROFESSION, CHRIST JESUS; who was faithful to his commi&s;&s;ion as the fir&s;t public Teacher of the go&s;pel amid&s;t a &s;eries of unexampled di&s;couragements; who experimentally knows the feelings and trials both of the man and the mini&s;ter; and who&s;e comforting voice to each of his upright and trembling &s;ervants is, LO I AM WITH THEE ALWAY: BE THOU FAITH|FUL UNTO DEATH, AND I WILL GIVE THEE A CROWN OF LIFE.</P>
<P>Under the &s;miles of this gracious Ma&s;ter may your fidelity and &s;ucce&s;s realize the be&s;t hopes of your ex|cellent Father and numerous friends, contribute em|inently to the religious pro&s;perity of this Society and Town, and at length be rewarded with &s;uperior glory in the kingdom of heaven.</P>
<P>My re&s;pected brethren of this church and congre|gation, we gratefully participate with you in the joy of this day. The amiable di&s;po&s;ition, the intellectu|al and moral improvements of your Pa&s;tor elect have long recommended him to tho&s;e, who have known both his earlier and maturer years. The&s;e accom|pli&s;hments, joined with his knowledge of human na|ture and of chri&s;tian divinity, form a happy pre&s;age of his future u&s;efulne&s;s and honor as a go&s;pel mini&s;|ter.

At the &s;ame time his youthful age, his delicate &s;en&s;ibilities and his arduous employment &s;olicit your candid and tender indulgence. You will therefore view both his private deportment and public perform|ances with a generous eye. You will cheri&s;h his comfort and reputation. You will &s;teadily and &s;e|riou&s;ly attend his mini&s;try. You will meekly receive and comply with his faithful admonitions. You will a&s;&s;i&s;t and encourage him by your affectionate prayers and corre&s;pondent endeavors. You will remember that neither you nor your children can expect any harve&s;t either of pre&s;ent religious improvement or of future glory from the be&s;t &s;eed of pa&s;toral in&s;truc|tion, unle&s;s you devoutly concur with your mini&s;ter. Attend, therefore, with earne&s;t care to the moral and religious culture of your own hearts, and to the chri&s;tian education and government of your hou&s;es. Diligently teach your children, both by doctrine and example, the rea&s;onablene&s;s, importance, and happi|ne&s;s of experimental and practical chri&s;tianity, the &s;acred and intere&s;ting nature of religious &s;entiments and in&s;titutions, particularly, of public wor&s;hip and in&s;truction on the day con&s;ecrated to our ri&s;en Lord, the great Author and Fini&s;her of our faith. Let your practice bear an open te&s;timony again&s;t that &s;triking want of con&s;i&s;tency and delicacy, of benevo|lence and piety, which marks too many characters at this day, e&s;pecially in &s;ome of our more polite and wealthy Corporations: I refer to tho&s;e who, while they affect a zealous care to introduce and maintain learned chri&s;tian In&s;truction yet <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> their public

<P>Excu&s;e, my brethren, the hone&s;t but friendly tone of this addre&s;s, and accept my be&s;t wi&s;hes and prayers for your temporal and everla&s;ting felicity.</P>
<P><HI>Fathers and Brethren of this great a&s;&s;embly,</HI></P>
<P>If the go&s;pel contain as we have heard, the words of truth and &s;oberne&s;s, if it be the me&s;&s;age of divine and everla&s;ting &s;alvation to our ruined race, how important is it that we all give it a welcome and obe|dient reception! How beautiful on the mountains of Zion are the feet of tho&s;e who bring the&s;e good tidings! If the truth of the chri&s;tian &s;cheme were on|ly probable or barely po&s;&s;ible, we could not ac|quit our&s;elves from the charge of madne&s;s in treating it with cold or di&s;dainful neglect. How un&s;peaka|bly great, then, mu&s;t be our obligation to believe and obey it when we have &s;uch various and &s;atisfactory proof, both of its divinity and importance! By rejecting this provi&s;ion of heavenly mercy we nece&s;&s;arily preclude our&s;elves from its infinite benefits, as well as incur the aggravated puni&s;hment, which &s;uch matchle&s;s fol|ly, ba&s;ene&s;s and impiety demand.</P>
<P>But whether we co-operate with, or fight again&s;t this divine plan, it &s;hall &s;till go on, till it reach its de&s;tined con&s;ummation. The period is fa&s;t ap|proaching, when chri&s;tianity, &s;tripped of every foreign

What benevolent and pious heart does not eagerly &s;pring forward to this glorious Era, and contribute its be&s;t efforts and prayers to its &s;peedy arrival? Above all, what &s;ober mind can avoid anticipating, and with the mo&s;t &s;oli|citous activity preparing for that FINAL DAY, when this great &s;cheme of providence &s;hall be fini&s;hed; when the word of truth, which we now preach and hear, &s;hall decide our endle&s;s fate; when, according to the awful de&s;cription of our Apo&s;tle, THE LORD JESUS SHALL BE REVEALED FROM HEAVEN IN FLAMING FIRE, TO TAKE VENGEANCE ON THOSE WHO OBEY NOT HIS GOSPEL; WHO SHALL BE PUN|ISHED WITH EVERLASTING DESTRUCTION FROM HIS PRESENCE AND THE GLORY OF HIS POWER; WHEN HE SHALL COME TO BE GLORIFIED IN HIS SAINTS, AND ADMIRED IN ALL THEM THAT BELIEVE.</P>

<HEAD>THE CHARGE BY THE REV. SAMUEL KIRKLAND.</HEAD>
<P>YOU have this day, my dear &s;on, in a &s;olemn and public manner, devoted your&s;elf to the &s;ervice of Chri&s;t in the mini&s;try of his go&s;pel; and by prayer and laying on of hands, you have been &s;eparated to this holy office.</P>
<P>The part a&s;&s;igned me in the &s;olemn and affecting tran&s;actions of the day, is to remind you, whom I may now addre&s;s, to the joy of the paternal brea&s;t, as my <HI>fellow-laborer</HI> in the go&s;pel, of the important duties, &s;acred obligations and gracious promi&s;es, that pertain to the mini&s;try which you have received of the Lord, and in his name to enforce them; in hope that the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit will impre&s;s them, like indelible char|acters, on your heart and ours.</P>
<P>The keys of the kingdom of heaven are committed to you, as to one whom we judge faithful. Go thou therefore, and preach the go&s;pel: teach in the Chri&s;|tian church; pre&s;ent the addre&s;&s;es of men to the Mo&s;t High who heareth prayer; ble&s;s in the name of the Lord; admini&s;ter the ordinances of the go&s;pel; and introduce others as occa&s;ion may invite into the
<PB N="36" REF="027775_0034_0FD63D5D326029F8">
mini&s;terial office, ever keeping in mind the exhorta|tion to "lay hands &s;uddenly on no man."</P>
<P>Your pa&s;toral care is to be more immediately exer|ci&s;ed, and your mini&s;terial labors more e&s;pecially de|voted to the church and religious &s;ociety, who have called you to the important &s;ervice; and who&s;e call you have now accepted in the mo&s;t public and &s;ol|emn manner. By diligence and fidelity, exhibit to them inconte&s;table evidence that you are willing to &s;pend and to be &s;pent, to promote their improvement and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of your preaching, a&s;&s;ert the being of the one living and true God; and di&s;play his per|fections and glory, who&s;e name alone is Jeho|vah. Declare the goodne&s;s and rea&s;onablene&s;s of the divine law as the eternal rule of righteou&s;ne&s;s; man's original &s;tate of innocence; his pre&s;ent un|done condition and entire moral depravity in con&s;e|quence of the fir&s;t apo&s;tacy; the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the divine &s;entence of condemnation on tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors; the ab&s;olutely hopele&s;s condition of men without a mediator. Labor to convince your hearers of their deplorable &s;tate by nature, that they may &s;ee and feel the nece&s;&s;ity of an intere&s;t in the Savior; then point out to them this only remedy which God hath provided, the <HI>Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> in the dignity of his divine per&s;on and the unequalled excellencies of his mediatorial character: by the many and weighty ar|guments which the go&s;pel furni&s;hes, "compel them to come in" to the obedience of faith and acknowl|edgment
<PB N="37" REF="027775_0035_0FD63D64D728D540">
of the truth. Urge them from the con&s;id|eration of the maje&s;ty of God; his &s;tupendous love in the gift of a Savior; the great &s;alvation and rich mercy, which he freely offers and as freely gives to all who are de&s;irous of it. Knowing the terrors of the Lord, per&s;uade them with bowels of tendere&s;t pity to be reconciled to God.</P>
<P>Proclaim the purcha&s;e and de&s;cent of the Holy Gho&s;t through the atonement, to &s;anctify the elect people of God: hold forth the nature and nece&s;&s;ity of regeneration by the power and efficacious grace of God. Te&s;tify to &s;inners of every de&s;cription repent|ance towards God and faith towards our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t: in the whole of this matter &s;tudy to approve your&s;elf to God; give to each his portion, &s;trong meat to them, who are able to bear it; but deal gent|ly with the lambs and feeble of the flock, and herein imitate the conde&s;cen&s;ion of the great and good &s;hep|herd.</P>
<P>Shun not to declare the whole coun&s;el of God. Keep back nothing that will be profitable to your people. Teach the way of God <HI>in truth</HI>; and call no man ma&s;ter on earth; for one is your ma&s;ter, even Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>See that you faithfully admini&s;ter the &s;eals of the new covenant, bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;upper, to mete and proper &s;ubjects. Exerci&s;e the di&s;cipline of Chri&s;t's hou&s;e, not as lording over God's heritage.</P>
<P>You are this day con&s;ecrated a bi&s;hop, an over&s;eer, a &s;teward in the hou&s;e of God: it is required in
<PB N="38" REF="027775_0036_0FD63D65C172E150">
&s;tewards that a man be found faithful. Let your eye therefore be &s;ingly directed to the glory of God and the be&s;t good of your people. Give your&s;elf wholly to your work, that your profiting may appear in all. Let your time and talents henceforward be con&s;ecra|ted time and con&s;ecrated talents: Be an example of the believers in word, in conver&s;ation, in charity, in &s;pirit, in faith, in purity; and no one will de&s;pi&s;e your youth. Flee what&s;oever is unbecoming a chri&s;|tian and a mini&s;ter, that if it be po&s;&s;ible you may ob|tain a good report of them al&s;o that are without. "Take heed to thy&s;elf and to thy doctrine; for in &s;o doing thou &s;halt both &s;ave thy&s;elf and them that hear thee." "Take heed to thy&s;elf." This is a fun|damental charge, which is fir&s;tly and con&s;tantly to be regarded. He is poorly qualified to lead others in the way of &s;alvation, who is not experimentally and practically acquainted with it him&s;elf. But I hope better things of you, my &s;on, though I thus &s;peak. Yet what holy vigilance, and con&s;tant prayer, what humility and &s;elf-denial, ought you to exerci&s;e, le&s;t that by any means, when <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> preached to oth|ers, you your&s;elf &s;hould be a ca&s;t away. If you are faithful in the di&s;charge of your tru&s;t, you will deliv|er your own &s;oul; be pure from the blood of all men, and a &s;weet &s;avor of Chri&s;t to God in them that per|i&s;h, as well as in them that are &s;aved: and then you may al&s;o comfortably hope for the divine ble&s;&s;ing on your endeavors. O, my &s;on, this is the warme&s;t wi&s;h of your father's heart, that you may have many &s;ouls
<PB N="39" REF="027775_0037_0FD63D66F8CA40F8">
as &s;eals of your mini&s;try, which &s;hall be your glory, and joy, and crown of rejoicing in the pre&s;ence of our Lord Je&s;us at his coming: You are a &s;on of prayers and of vows: May God Almighty ble&s;s you; "and may you increa&s;e, whil&s;t I decrea&s;e; and &s;hine many years as a bright &s;tar in the Redeemer's hand, when I, your natural father, am &s;et" and &s;een no more.</P>
<P>Finally, that you may attain the ends of your min|i&s;try and experience its ble&s;&s;ed fruits in your own &s;al|vation and that of your people, we, who are your fathers in the go&s;pel, by virtue of our office, do entreat and charge you in the name of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to take heed to the mini&s;try, which you have re|ceived; we be&s;eech and charge you by the dear and glorious name of the ever ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, to take care of the honor of his name in your mini&s;trations: oh, never rob him of his glory, who is God-man, media|tor; never deny the Lord, who hath bought you. We be&s;eech and charge you by the blood of Chri&s;t, by the mercies of the living God, by the invaluable worth of precious immortals, that you fulfil all your mini&s;try; and watch for &s;ouls as one that mu&s;t give an account.</P>
<P>We charge you by the &s;olemnities of this day, by the vows of God, which you have now taken upon you; we charge you in the pre&s;ence of tho&s;e, who have called you to mini&s;ter in holy things, in the pre&s;ence of this whole a&s;&s;embly, and of the elect an|gels; and finally, we charge you in the pre&s;ence of almighty God, and our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to whom is committed all judgment, who hath eyes as a flame

of fire, and in the light of eternal glory will require at our hands what we have done with the go&s;pel he gave us to preach, and what are become of the &s;ouls he committed to our care; we charge you to fulfil the work of your mini&s;try, and by your pre&s;ent dili|gence, zeal and fidelity, prepare to give up your account with joy.</P>
<P>It is a &s;trait and thorny road into which you have entered; as we your fathers in the mini&s;try know by experience. You will find in it great difficulties and much oppo&s;ition; and from a clear and impre&s;&s;ive view of the magnitude of the tru&s;t, will be often led to cry out "who is &s;ufficient for the&s;e things," and who can undertake the mini&s;terial office without trembling? But remember that you &s;erve the be&s;t of ma&s;ters, who&s;e &s;trength is perfected in weakne&s;s; and are engaged in the be&s;t of works; a work, in which the eternal God, and his holy angels are con|&s;tantly employed. E&s;pecially, for your &s;upport and con&s;olation under the namele&s;s difficulties and trials of your office, hear only one word from our a&s;cended Lord, "Lo, I am with you:" Gracious promi&s;e! this is enough: this is all: you can a&s;k no more. "Lo, I am with you, as a friend, a coun&s;ellor, a &s;hield," a guardian.</P>
<P>Take courage then, my &s;on. The ma&s;ter is kind, the cau&s;e is good, the conflict &s;hort, the crown glori|ous, and eternity long enough for re&s;t. Yet a little while if thou continue faithful, and the joys of heav|en will be poured into thy &s;oul, in that ble&s;&s;ed &s;ent|iment "Well done good and faithful &s;ervant, enter.</P>
