<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR PARENTS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I CAN not re&s;i&s;t the feelings which impel me to &s;eize this fir&s;t, and perhaps only, opportunity, of publicly te&s;ti|fying to you my re&s;pect and affection.&mdash;To you I am indebted, not merely for life, but for in&s;truction and example happily calculated to explain, and impre&s;s me with a &s;en&s;e of, its value, and the ine&s;timable purpo&s;es to which it may be applied. If, in my pa&s;t or future con|duct, any conformity to your de&s;ires and precepts appear; if, by any pa&s;t or future exertions of mine, the welfare of mankind be in any degree promoted; to your cares, to your vigilance, to your virtues, will it be owing. It is, therefore, a &s;imple act of ju&s;tice, to make my fir&s;t ac|knowledgments to you.&mdash;The panegyric of a poet, on his patron, may ju&s;tly be &s;u&s;pected; but who will venture to que&s;tion the &s;incerity of a &s;on, who dedicates to his pa|rents?&mdash;Nor need your mode&s;ty be wounded, by this pub|lic mark of my e&s;teem. Should my conduct prove me worthy to claim relation to you, it will be&s;t pronounce your eulogy: my follies and my vices can only affect my&s;elf.&mdash; Accept then, my dear parents, this new proof of my &s;in|cere and filial love.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AN Author, of &s;ome reputation, has declared it as his opi|nion, that every Preface &s;hould be hi&s;torical; and explain, not only the de&s;ign of the work it precedes, but the circum&s;tances and motives which led to its compo&s;ition. It would ill become me to controvert a doctrine &s;o convenient for my pre&s;ent pur|po&s;e. Authors, it is true, are apt to mea&s;ure the re&s;pect of others for their productions, by the e&s;timation in which they are held by them&s;elves. In this they may be, and often are, de|ceived. Yet, perhaps, they do not greatly err, when they &s;uppo&s;e the hi&s;tory of their performances would not be un|plea&s;ing to tho&s;e who have thought the performances them|&s;elves worthy of their attention. Such an error, at lea&s;t, is venial; and will, I hope, be pardoned by tho&s;e who may deem the &s;ucceeding &s;tatement unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The principal &s;cenes of the following Drama were compo&s;ed in March, 1791; as an exerci&s;e, to beguile the wearine&s;s of a &s;hort period of involuntary lei&s;ure; and without any view to theatrical repre&s;entation. From that time, till the month of October, 1793, they lay neglected, and almo&s;t forgotten. An accident then bringing them to recollection, &s;everal &s;hort &s;cenes were added, agreeable to my original de&s;ign; and the whole adapted to the Stage. The piece was pre&s;ented to the <HI>then</HI> Managers of The Old American Company, for their acceptance, the December following; but the peculiar &s;itua|tion of the Theatre prevented any attention to this application, till June, 1794; when, on a change in the management, it
<PB N="6" REF="032843_0005_0FF5B6A4150D09C0">
was accepted. An interval of &s;ix months, and a further ac|quaintance with the Stage, had convinced me that the Piece might undergo alterations, with advantage. The&s;e were un|dertaken, immediately: the lo&s;s of a comic character, which was now rejected, was &s;upplied by two new &s;cenes; addi|tional &s;ongs were compo&s;ed; and a Drama of two acts, in pro&s;e, was converted into the Opera, in its pre&s;ent form, in the cour&s;e of the &s;ucceeding month. The inherent defects of the plan were &s;uch as could not be remedied, without be&s;tow|ing on the &s;ubject a degree of attention incompatible with pro|fe&s;&s;ional engagements; and which I, therefore, thought my|&s;elf ju&s;tified in withholding. But &s;hould this performance meet the &s;ame generous indulgence, in private, with which it was received, in public, I &s;hall neither attempt to di&s;arm Cri|tici&s;m of her &s;everity, nor be a&s;hamed of this feeble effort to contribute to the rational amu&s;ement of my fellow-citizens.</P>

<P><HI>P. S.</HI> It may not be improper to ob&s;erve, (though the reader can &s;carcely be &s;uppo&s;ed uninformed, in this particular,) that the fir&s;t, &s;econd, third, fifth and &s;ixth &s;ongs, in the third Act of the following Drama, are from Gold&s;mith; and all, except the fir&s;t, from the Ballad of "Edwin and Angelina." I have taken the liberty to make a &s;light alteration in the &s;econd, to accommodate it more perfectly to my purpo&s;e; and it will be obvious that, in the principal &s;cene between Edwin and An|gelina, I have availed my&s;elf of the &s;entiments, and, as far as po&s;&s;ible, of the very expre&s;&s;ions of the Author.</P>
