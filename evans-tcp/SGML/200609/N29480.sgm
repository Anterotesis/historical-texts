<HEAD>At a CONVENTION of the REPRESENTATIVES Of the Several TOWNS and Villages of the Massachusetts-COLONY in NEW-ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<P>WE the Representatives of the several <HI>Towns</HI> and <HI>Villages</HI> of the <HI>Massachusets Colony</HI> in <HI>New-Eng|land,</HI> convened at <HI>Boston,</HI> May 22<HI>nd.</HI> 1689. hav|ing fully and deliberately examined the Minds and Instructions of the several <HI>Towns</HI> belonging to the said <HI>Colony;</HI> do find it to be the General Consent &amp; Concurrence of our several <HI>Towns</HI> to <HI>Reassume</HI> the Government according to <HI>Charter-Rights:</HI> Having also Weighed and Considered the Propositions presented &amp; ten|dered to us by our Honourable <HI>Governour, Deputy-Governour,</HI> &amp; <HI>Assistants</HI> chosen &amp; sworn <HI>Anno</HI> 1686: Do therefore with Re|spect to the Directions by our several <HI>Towns,</HI> and in Prosecution of our former Declaration presented <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word"> DECLARE our Minds and Resolutions for the Settlement of Civil Government amongst us, according to <HI>Charter</HI>-Directions: Having seriously Weighed the present Circumstances &amp; shatter'd Condition this <HI>Colony</HI> is in;</P>
<P>And being tenderly sensible of the Afflicting Hand of GOD which is <HI>at present</HI> upon us in regard of our <HI>Unsettlement</HI> &amp; <HI>Want of that Civil Jurisdiction</HI> that in former dayes we have rejoiced in; and Knowing also the earnest Desires and Expectations of the several places we belong unto, to receive a comfortable An|swer &amp; Return in order to their <HI>Re-instating</HI> &amp; <HI>Settlement</HI> under their former Patent-Rights, that so they might enjoy Tranquil|lity, as in former dayes and pleasant years that are past. This <HI>Colony</HI> having likewise solemnly Addressed themselves to Almigh|ty GOD by <HI>Fasting</HI> and <HI>Prayer,</HI> for Pardon of our manifold <HI>Wilderness-Provocations,</HI> and Restoring to us our <HI>Pleasant things,</HI> and for <HI>Direction</HI> in this present Juncture to such Methods and Ways of Settlement of <HI>Civil Rule,</HI> as may most conduce to His <HI>Glory,</HI> and the Peace, Safety and <HI>Prosperity</HI> of this our <HI>poor distres|sed Land:</HI> And taking signal Notice of a Gracious <HI>Answer</HI> to our Prayers, in the <HI>Unanimous</HI> Agreement of our several Towns &amp; Villages, <HI>concurring</HI> in their Apprehensions and Desires of the Reviving of our <HI>Charter-Rights</HI> &amp; <HI>Priviledges;</HI> and that we do again Settle upon <HI>that</HI> firm <HI>Foundation</HI> that we have already built upon, and have signally observed the Presence of GOD attending the same,</P>
<P>We do therefore so far prize our former Liberties and En|joyments both <HI>Civil</HI> and <HI>Sacred,</HI> as to resolve (by the help of God) to venture our Lives &amp; Estates for the <HI>Reviving</HI> &amp; <HI>Main|taining</HI> of them; knowing and believing such a way of Settle|ment comfortable <HI>to</HI> &amp; safe <HI>for</HI> our selves; and Correspondent to the noble Undertaking of His Royal Highness the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Orange,</HI> in the late Settlment of Affairs in the Renowned <HI>English</HI> Nation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Whose ancient Liberties and Rights in their seve|ral Cities and <HI>Corporations,</HI> He hath reinvested them withal; and (we doubt not) will encourage and Commend <HI>us</HI> (in the middst of our Oppression) for imitating so Noble &amp; <HI>Prince-like</HI> a Pattern in using all due meanes for the Recovery of what was so unjustly &amp; unreasonably <HI>rent</HI> out of our hands.</P>
<P>The <HI>Reasons</HI> inducing us to these our <HI>Resolutions</HI> premised are</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That it is an Undertaking allowed and countenanced by His Royal Highness our Renowned Prince that we be reinstated in our Pa|tent Priviledges, and be found in such a Method of Government ac|cording to our ancient Charter Rights, which He hath given Patterns</HI> of <HI>and Directions</HI> to <HI>in the Realm of</HI> England, <HI>which Realm we have a Dependance</HI> upon <HI>and stand in so near a Relation</HI> to.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That there is an absolute Necessity of</HI> Settlement of Civil Go|vernment <HI>amongst our selves, without which we cannot enjoy Peace Safety and Tranquillity.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>That the Dependance and Method of Settlement of the said Government in this present Juncture, lieth wholly in the Voice of the</HI> People.</P>
<P>Being Sensible also of the great Disadvantage &amp; Danger we are all <HI>in,</HI> in this present Vacancy of Government, subject to <HI>Vi|olence.</HI> Likewise understanding the great Disadvantages th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">s Merchants and Traders, and all honest men are in of Recover|ing of their honest Debts and Dues, whereby they may main|tain their Trading, and approve themselves faithful to those (not only at home, but in Foreign Countreys) they <HI>Correspond</HI> withal.</P>
<P>We do therefore trust in Almighty GOD to <HI>carry on</HI> &amp; <HI>pros|per</HI> our Desires &amp; Endeavours, which GOD hath so farr suc|ceeded.</P>
<P>The <HI>Representatives</HI> of the several <HI>Towns</HI> in said <HI>Colony,</HI> having seriously weighed the sad Circumstances that this our Countrey is at present under; Do hereby (in behalf of our selves and Countrey) Declare this to be our mind and full Resolutions (by Divine Assistance) to settle a Government according to <HI>Charter-Directions,</HI> &amp; our <HI>Patent-Priviledges.</HI> And do hereby <HI>declare</HI> the Honourable <HI>SIMON BRADSTREET</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> our Gover|nour, <HI>Thomas Danforth</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Deputy-Governour, with the rest of the Assistants chosen and sworn <HI>Anno</HI> 1686, to be Reinstated as formerly, and take the present Care &amp; Conduct of this peo|ple, together with the Deputies sent from the respective <HI>Towns</HI> of this <HI>Colony,</HI> according to ancient Custom, and as need re|quires: And that there be <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Jurisdiction</HI> put forth, for the Preservation of our Peace, Prosperity and Safety. Likewise that there be a Choice made of a <HI>Major General,</HI> for the Regu|lating of Military Affairs; and also <HI>Assistants</HI> for the Supply of such as are wanting in <HI>Government;</HI> and that this Method of Go|vernment may be found amongst us when Order shall come from the higher Powers in <HI>England</HI></P>
<P>We do therefore <HI>Devolve</HI> the full <HI>Power of Government</HI> upon, and Intrust it <HI>in</HI> the Hands abovesaid, fully Confiding in the said Honourable Persons for the <HI>Administrations of Government</HI> for the ensueing part of this year, till a further Choice be made according to <HI>Charter-Direction</HI> as aforesaid; But in case Order from Higher Power from <HI>England</HI> (upon whom we have De|pendance) be transmitted for any Alteration: Then the said Government thus Constituted do signify the same to the respec|tive Towns of this <HI>Colony,</HI> That so they may be Consulted with in Order to their Approbation and Compliance.</P>
<P>Further, We do expect, and signify our Desires (and that according to our several Instructions from the Several Towns, whose Representatives we are) that there be an Enlargement of <HI>Free-men</HI> for the annual <HI>Choice of Government</HI> and all Votes re|lating thereunto, and that the Government thus <HI>Re-instated</HI> do faithfully endeavour the <HI>Confirmation</HI> and Settleing of <HI>Charter-Priviledges.</HI></P>
<P>And we do further Declare our High Esteem of those Honour|able and Worthy Gentlemen, who have intervened in an hour of our greatest Extremity and Temptation, and implore Al|mighty GOD to retaliate their great Kindness, &amp; grant them the Blessings of this &amp; a better Life, and hope we shall pay all honourable and due respects <HI>to</HI> them, and perform <HI>for</HI> them what may be justly expected at our hands.</P>
<P><HI>This we present as a full and Final Declaration of our Minds and Votes, expecting the Conservation of our Peace from the Government thus Constituted, further depending upon Your Honours Compliance, in such and no other way of Settlement, Knowing in this our Act. we have discharged our Consciences to our Countrey, contrived the best Expedient for the present Settlement, and must leave it to Your Ho|nours Defect, if any evil Occurrence shall for the future happen to this Countrey, by your Non-Compliance with us.</HI></P>
