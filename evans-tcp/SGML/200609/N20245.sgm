<HEAD>THE AFFECTING HISTORY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>FREDERIC Manheim, an indu&s;trious German, with his family, con&s;i&s;ting of his wife, Catharine, a daughter of eighteen years of age, and Maria and Chri&s;tina, his younge&s;t children (twins,) about &s;ixteen, re&s;ided near the river Mohawk, eight miles we&s;t of John&s;ton. On the 19th of October, 1779, the father being at work at &s;ome di&s;tance from his habitation, and the mother and elde&s;t daughter on a vi&s;it at a neighbour's, two ho&s;tile Cana&s;adaga Indians ru&s;hed in, and captured the twin &s;i&s;ters.</P>
<P>The party to which the&s;e &s;avages belonged, con&s;i&s;ted of fifty warriors, who, after &s;ecuring twenty-three of the inhabitants of that neighbourhood, (among whom was the unfortunate Frederic Manheim,) and firing their hou&s;es, retired for four days with the utmo&s;t precipitancy, till they were quite &s;afe from pur&s;uit. The place where they halted on the evening of the day of re&s;t, was a thick pine &s;wamp, which rendered the darkne&s;s of an uncommonly gloomy night, &s;till more dreadful. The Indians kindled a fire, which they had not done before, and ordered their pri&s;oners, whom they kept together, to refre&s;h them&s;elves with &s;uch provi&s;ions as they had. The Indians ate by them|&s;elves. In&s;tead of retiring to re&s;t after &s;upping, the ap|palled
<PB N="6" REF="026540_0005_0FD093B41315F0C8">
captives ob&s;erved their enemies bu&s;ied in ope|rations which boded nothing good. Two &s;aplings were pruned clear of branches up to the very top, and all the bru&s;h cleared away for &s;everal rods around them. While this was doing, others were &s;plitting pitch pine billets into &s;mall &s;plinters about five inches in length, and as &s;mall as one's little finger, &s;harpening one end, and dipping the other in melted turpentine.</P>
<P>At length, with countenances di&s;torted by infernal fury, and with hideous yells, the two &s;avages who had captured the haple&s;s Maria and Chri&s;tina, leaped into the mid&s;t of their circle, and dragged tho&s;e ill|fated maidens, &s;hrieking, from the embraces of their companions. The&s;e warriors had di&s;agreed about who&s;e property the girls &s;hould be, as they had jointly &s;eized them; and, to terminate the di&s;pute, agreeably to the abominable u&s;age of the &s;avages, it was determined by the chiefs of the party, that the pri&s;oners, who gave ri&s;e to the contention, &s;hould be de&s;troyed; and that their captors &s;hould be the principal agents in the execrable bu&s;ine&s;s. The&s;e furies a&s;&s;i&s;ted by their com|rades, &s;tripped the forlorn girls, already convul&s;ed with apprehen&s;ions, and tied each to a &s;apling, with their hands as high extended above their heads as po&s;|&s;ible; and then pitched them from their knees to their &s;houlders with upwards of &s;ix hundred of the &s;harp|ened &s;plinters above de&s;cribed, which, at every punc|ture, were attended with &s;creams of di&s;tre&s;s, that echoed and re-echoed through the wilderne&s;s. And then to complete the infernal tragedy, the &s;plinters, all &s;tanding erect on the bleeding victims, were every one &s;et on fire, and exhibited a &s;cene of mon&s;trous mi&s;ery, beyond the power of &s;peech to de&s;cribe, or even the imagination to conceive. It was not until near three hours had elap&s;ed from the commencement of their torments, and that they had lo&s;t almo&s;t every re&s;emblance of the human form, that the&s;e helple&s;s virgins &s;unk down in the arms of their deliverer, Death.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE following is a ju&s;t and true account of the tragical &s;cene, of my family's falling by the &s;a|vages, which I related when at your hou&s;e in Philadel|phia, and you reque&s;ted me to forward in writing. On the &s;econd &s;abbath in May, in the year 1782, being my appointment at one of my meeting hou&s;es, about a mile from my dwelling hou&s;e, I &s;et out with my dear wife and five children, for public wor&s;hip. Not &s;u&s;pecting any danger, I walked behind 200 yards, with my bible in my hand, meditating&mdash;as I was thus employed, all on a &s;udden, I was greatly alarmed with the frightful &s;hrieks of my dear family before me&mdash;I immediately ran with all the &s;peed I could, vainly hunting a club as I ran, till I got within 40 yards of them: my poor wife &s;eeing me, cried to me make my e&s;cape&mdash;an Indian ran up to &s;hoot me. I had to &s;trip, and by &s;o doing out-ran him. My wife had a &s;ucking child in her arms: this little infant they killed, and &s;calped. They then &s;truck my wife at &s;undry times, but not getting her down, the Indian, who aimed to &s;hoot me, ran to her, &s;hot her through the body, and &s;calped her: my little boy, an only &s;on, about &s;ix years old, they &s;unk the hatchet into his brains, and thus di&s;patched him. A daughter, be&s;ides the infant, they al&s;o killed and &s;calped. My elde&s;t daughter, who is yet alive, was hid in a tree, about 20 yards from the place where the re&s;t were killed, and &s;aw the whole proceedings. She &s;eeing the Indians all go off, as &s;he thought, got up, and deliberately crept out from the hollow trunk; but one of them e&s;pying her, ran ha&s;tily up, knocked her down, and &s;calped her.&mdash;al&s;o her only &s;urviving &s;i&s;ter, on who&s;e head they did not

She, and the before mentioned one, are &s;till miraculou&s;ly pre&s;erved, though, as you mu&s;t think, I have had, and &s;till have, a great deal of trouble and expen&s;e with them, be&s;ides anxiety about them, in&s;omuch that I am, as to worldly circum&s;tances, almo&s;t ruined. I am yet in hopes of &s;eeing them cured; they &s;till, ble&s;&s;ed be God, retain their &s;en&s;es, notwith&s;tanding the painful operations they have already and mu&s;t yet pa&s;s through. At the time I ran round to &s;ee what was become of my family, and found my dear and affectionate wife, with five children, all &s;calped in le&s;s than ten minutes, from the fir&s;t out&s;et&mdash;no one, my dear brother, can conceive how I felt&mdash;this, you may well &s;uppo&s;e, was killing to me. I in&s;tantly fainted away, and was borne off by a friend, who by this time had found us out&mdash;When I recovered, oh the angui&s;h of my &s;oul!&mdash;I cried&mdash;would to God I had died for them, would to God I had died with them.

<HEAD>Remarkable encounter of a white man with two Indians. In a letter to a gentleman of Philadelphia.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>We&s;tmoreland, <DATE>April 26, 1779.</DATE></DATELINE> <SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I WROTE you a note a few days ago, in which I promi&s;ed you the particulars of an affair between a white man of this county, and two Indians: now I mean to relate the whole &s;tory, and it is as follows:</P>
<P>The white man is upwards of &s;ixty years of age; his name is David Morgan, a kin&s;man to col. Morgan, of the rifle battalion. This man had, through fear of the Indians, fled to a fort about twenty miles above the province line, and near the ea&s;t &s;ide of Mononga|hela river. From thence he &s;ent &s;ome of his younger children to his plantation, which was about a mile di&s;tant, there to do &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s in the field. He af|terwards thought fit to follow, and &s;ee how they fared. Getting to his field, and &s;eating him&s;elf upon the fence, within view of his children, where they were at work, he e&s;pied two Indians making towards them; on which he called to his children to make their e&s;cape. The Indians immediately bent their cour&s;e towards him. He made the be&s;t ha&s;te to e&s;cape away, that his age and con&s;equent infirmity would permit; but &s;oon found he would be overtaken, which made him think of defence. Being armed with a good rifle, he faced about, and found him&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of run|ning four of five perches towards the Indians, in order to obtain &s;helter behind a tree of &s;ufficient &s;ize.</P>
<P>This unexpected manoeuvre obliged the Indians, who were clo&s;e by, to &s;top, where they had but &s;mall timber to &s;helter behind, which gave mr. Morgan an op|portunity of &s;hooting one of them dead upon the &s;pot. The other, taking the advantage of Morgan's empty gun, advanced upon him, and put him to flight a &s;e|cond time, and being lighter of foot than the old man, &s;oon came up within a few paces, when he fired at
<PB N="10" REF="026540_0009_0FD093BB23FC1110">
him, but fortunately mi&s;&s;ed him. On his mr. Morgan faced about again, to try his fortune, and clubbed his firelock. The Indian, by this time, had got his toma|hawk in order for a throw, at which they are very dextrous. Morgan made the blow, and the Indian the throw, almo&s;t at the &s;ame in&s;tant, by which the little finger was cut off Morgan's left hand, and the one next to it almo&s;t off, and his gun broke off by the lock. Now they came to clo&s;e grips. Morgan put the Indian down; but &s;oon found him&s;elf overturned, and the In|dian upon him, feeling for his knife, and yelling mo&s;t hideou&s;ly, as their manner is, when they look upon victory to be certain. However, a woman's apron, which the Indian had plundered out of a hou&s;e in the neighbourhood, and tied on him, above his knife, was now in his way, and &s;o hindered him getting at it quickly, that Morgan got one of his fingers fa&s;t in his mouth, and deprived him of the u&s;e of that hand, by holding it, and di&s;concerted him con&s;iderably by chew|ing it; all the while ob&s;erving how he would come on with his knife. At length the Indian had got hold of his knife, but &s;o far towards the blade, that Morgan got a &s;mall hold of the hinder end; and as the Indian pulled it out of the &s;cabbard, Morgan giving his finger a &s;evere &s;crew with his teeth, twitched it out through his hand, cutting it mo&s;t grievou&s;ly. By this time they were both got partly on their feet, and the Indian was endeavouring to di&s;engage him&s;elf; but Morgan held fa&s;t by the finger, and quickly applied the point of the knife to the &s;ide of its &s;avage owner; a bone happening in the way prevented its penetrating any great depth, but a &s;econd blow directed more towards the belly, found free pa&s;&s;age into his bowels. The old man turned the point upwards, made a large wound, burying the knife therein, and &s;o took his departure in&s;tantly to the fort, with the news of his adventure.</P>
<P>On the report of mr. Morgan, a party went out from the fort, and found the fir&s;t Indian where he had
<PB N="11" REF="026540_0010_0FD093BCA4075F98">
fallen; the &s;econd they found not yet dead, at one hundred yards di&s;tance from the &s;cene of action, hid in the top of a fallen tree, where he had picked the knife out of his body, after which had come out parched corn, &amp;c. and had bound up his wound with the apron aforementioned; and on fir&s;t &s;ight he &s;aluted them with, How do do, broder, how do do, broder? but alas! poor &s;avage, their brotherhood to him ex|tended only to tomahawking, &s;calping, and, to gratify &s;ome peculiar feelings of their own, &s;kinning them both; and they have made drum heads of their &s;kins.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>We&s;tmoreland, <DATE>April 26, 1779.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE wrote to mr.&mdash;of your city, an ac|count of a very particular affair between a white man and two Indians. I am now to give you a relation in which you will &s;ee how a per&s;on of your &s;ex acquit|ted her&s;elf in defence of her own life, and that of her hu&s;band and children.</P>
<P>The lady, who is the burthen of this &s;tory, is named Experience Bozarth. She lives on a creek called Dun|kard-creek, in the &s;outh-we&s;t corner of this county. About the middle of March la&s;t, two or three families who were afraid to &s;tay at home, gathered to her hou&s;e, and there &s;tayed; looking on them&s;elves to be &s;afer than when all &s;cattered about at their own hou&s;es.</P>
<P>On a certain day &s;ome of the children thus collected, came running in from play in great ha&s;te, &s;aying, there were ugly red men. One of the men in the hou&s;e &s;tep|ped to the door, where he received a ball in the &s;ide of his brea&s;t, which cau&s;ed him to fall back into the hou&s;e. The Indian was immediately in over him, and engaged with another man who was in the hou&s;e. The man to&s;&s;ed the Indian on a bed, and called for a knife to
<PB N="12" REF="026540_0011_0FD093BE0684CAF0">
kill him, (Ob&s;erve the&s;e were all the men that were in the hou&s;e) Now mrs. Bozarth appears the only de|fence, who not finding a knife at hand, took up an axe that lay by, and with one blow cut out the brains of the Indian. At that in&s;tant, (for all was in&s;tantaneous) a &s;econd Indian entered the door, and &s;hot the man dead, who was engaged with the Indian on the bed. Mrs. Bozarth turned to this &s;econd Indian, and with her axe gave him &s;everal large cuts, &s;ome of which let his entrails appear. He bawled out, murder, murder. On this, &s;undry other Indians (who had hitherto been fully employed, killing &s;ome children out of doors) came ru&s;hing to his relief; one of who&s;e heads mrs. Bozarth clove in two with her axe, as he &s;tuck it in at the door, which laid him flat upon the &s;oil. Another &s;natched hold of the wounded bellowing fellow, and pulled him out of doors, and mrs. Bozarth, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the man who was fir&s;t &s;hot in the door, and by this time a little recovered, &s;hut the door after them, and made it fa&s;t, where they kept garri&s;on for &s;everal days, the dead white man and dead Indian both in the hou&s;e with them, and the Indians about the hou&s;e be&s;ieging them. At length they were relieved by a party &s;ent for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>This whole affair, to &s;hutting the door, was not perhaps more than three minutes in acting.</P>

<HEAD>Narrative of the adventures of capt. I&s;aac Stewart; taken from his own mouth, in March, 1782.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS taken pri&s;oner about 50 miles to the we&s;t|ward of Fort Pitt, about 18 years ago, by the In|dians, and was carried by them to the Waba&s;h, with many more white men, who were executed with cir|cum&s;tances of horrid barbarity; it was my good for|tune to call forth the &s;ympathy of Ro&s;e, called the good woman of the town, who was permitted to re|deem
<PB N="13" REF="026540_0012_0FD093BF8A6A88D0">
from the flames, by giving, as my ran&s;om, a hor&s;e.</P>
<P>After remaining two years in bondage among&s;t the Indians, a Spaniard came to the nation, having been &s;ent from Mexico on di&s;coveries. He made application to the chiefs, for redeeming me and another white man in the like &s;ituation, a native of Wales, named John Davey; which they complied with, and we took our departure in company with the Spaniard, and tra|velled to the we&s;tward, cro&s;&s;ing the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi near la riviere Rouge, or Red River, up which we travelled 700 miles, when we came to a nation of Indians re|markably white, and who&s;e hair was of a reddi&s;h co|lour, at lea&s;t mo&s;tly &s;o; they lived on the banks of a &s;mall river that empties it&s;elf into the Red River, which is called the River Po&s;t. In the morning of the day after our arrival among&s;t the&s;e Indians, the Welchman informed me, that he was determined to remain with them, giving as a rea&s;on that he under&s;tood their lan|guage, it being very little different from the Welch. My curio&s;ity was excited very much by this informati|on, and I went with my companion to the chief men of the town, who informed him (in a language I had no knowledge of, and which had no affinity to that of any other Indian tongue I ever heard) that their fore|fathers of this nation came from a foreign country, and landed on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, de&s;cribing particularly the country now called We&s;t-Florida, and that on the Spaniards taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Mexico, they fled to their then abode; and as a proof of the truth of what he advanced, he brought forth rolls of parchment, which were carefully tied up in otter skins, on which were large characters, written with blue ink; the cha|racters I did not under&s;tand, and the Welchman being unacquainted with letters, even of his own language, I was not able to know the meaning of the writing. They are a bold, hardy, intrepid people, very warlike, and the women beautiful, when compared with other Indians.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="026540_0013_0FD093C641E8FBB0">
We left this nation, after being kindly treated and reque&s;ted to remain among&s;t them, being only two in number, the Spaniard and my&s;elf, and we continued our cour&s;e up the waters of the Red River, till we came to a nation of Indians, called Windots, that never had &s;een a white man before, and who were unac|quainted with the u&s;e of fire arms. On our way, we came to a tran&s;parent &s;tream, which to our great &s;ur|prize, we found to de&s;cend into the earth, and, at the foot of a ridge of mountains, di&s;appeared, it was re|markably clear, and, near to it, we found the bones of two animals, of &s;uch a &s;ize that a man might walk under the ribs, and the teeth were very heavy.</P>
<P>The nation of Indians who had never &s;een a white man, lived near the &s;ource of the Red River, and there the Spaniard di&s;covered, to his great joy, gold du&s;t in the brooks and rivulets; and being informed by the Indians, that a nation lived farther we&s;t, who were very rich, and who&s;e arrows were pointed with gold, we &s;et out in the hope of reaching their country, and travelled about five hundred miles, till we came to a ridge of mountains, which we cro&s;&s;ed, and from which the &s;treams run due we&s;t, and at the foot of the moun|tains, the Spaniard gave proofs of joy and great &s;atisfac|tion, having found gold in great abundance. I was not acquainted with the nature of the ore, but I lifted up what he called gold du&s;t from the bottom of the little rivulets i&s;&s;uing from the cavities of the rocks, and it had a yellow ca&s;t, and was remarkably heavy: but &s;o much was the Spaniard &s;atisfied, he relinqui&s;hed his plan of pro&s;ecuting his journey, being perfectly con|vinced that he had found a country full of gold.</P>
<P>On our return he took a different route, and, when we reached the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi, we went in a canoe to the mouth of the Mi&s;&s;ouri, where we found a Spani&s;h po&s;t; there I was di&s;charged by the Spaniard, went to the country of the Chicke&s;aws, from thence to the Che|rokees, and &s;oon reached Ninety-&s;ix, in South Carolina.</P>

The Indians then &s;crambled about the articles in the hou&s;e; when they were at this work, the deponent went out of the hou&s;e, and hol|lowed to the people in the block hou&s;e; one of the Indians then ran up and &s;topped her mouth, another ran up with his tomahawk drawn, and a third ran and &s;eized the tomahawk and called her his &s;quaw; this la&s;t Indian claimed her as his, and continued by her; about fifteen of the Indians then ran down towards the block hou&s;e, and fired their guns at the block and &s;tore hou&s;e, in con&s;equence of which one &s;oldier was killed, and another wounded, one having been at the &s;pring, and the other in coming or looking out of the &s;tore hou&s;e. This deponent then told the Indians there were about forty men in the block hou&s;e, and each man had two guns, the Indians then went to them that
<PB N="16" REF="026540_0015_0FD093C40E474600">
were firing at the block hou&s;e, and brought them back. They then began to drive the deponent and her chil|dren away; but a boy, about three years old, being unwilling to leave the hou&s;e, they took it by the heels, and da&s;hed <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> hou&s;e; then &s;tabbed and &s;calped it. They then took the deponent and the two other children, to the top of the hill, where they &s;top|ped until they tied up the plunder they had got. While they were bu&s;y about this, the deponent count|ed them, and the number amounted to thirty-two, in|cluding two white men, that were with them, painted like the Indians.</P>
<P>That &s;everal of the Indians could &s;peak Engli&s;h, and that &s;he knew three or four of them very well, having often &s;een them go up and down the Alleghany river, two of them &s;he knew to be Seneccas, and two Mun|&s;ees, who had got their guns mended by her hu&s;band about two years ago. That they &s;ent two Indians with her, and the others took their cour&s;e towards Puckty. That &s;he, the children, and the two Indians had not gone above two hundred yards, when the Indians caught two of her uncle's hor&s;es, put her and the younge&s;t child on one, and one of the Indians and the other child on the other. That the two Indians then took her and the children to the Alleghany river, and took them over in bark canoes, as they could not get the hor&s;es to &s;wim the river. After they had cro&s;&s;ed the river, the olde&s;t child, a boy of about five years of age, began to mourn for his brother: one of the In|dians then tomahawked and &s;calped him. That they travelled all day very hard, and that night arrived at a large camp covered with bark, which, by appearance, might hold fifty men; that the camp appeared to have been occupied &s;ome time, it was very much beaten, and large beaten paths went out in different directions from it; that night they took her about three hundred yards from the camp, into a large dark bottom, bound her arms, gave her &s;ome bed clothes, and lay down
<PB N="17" REF="026540_0016_0FD093C6525298F8">
one on each &s;ide of her. That the next morning they took her into a thicket on the hill &s;ide, and one re|mained with her till the middle of the day, while the other went to watch the path, lea&s;t &s;ome white people &s;hould follow them. They then exchanged places dur|ing the remainder of the day; &s;he got a piece of dry veni&s;on, about the bulk of an egg, that day, and a piece about the &s;ame &s;ize the day they were marching; that evening, (Wedne&s;day the 23d) they moved her to a new place, and &s;ecured her as the night before: during the day of the 23d, &s;he made &s;everal attempts to get the Indian's gun or tomahawk, that was guard|ing her, and, could &s;he have got either, &s;he would have put him to death. She was nearly detected in trying to get the tomahawk from his belt.</P>
<P>The next morning (Thur&s;day) one of the Indians went out as on the day before to watch the path. The other lay down and fell a&s;leep. When &s;he found he was &s;leeping, &s;he &s;tole her &s;hort gown, handkerchief and a child's frock, and then made her e&s;cape&mdash;the &s;un was then about half an hour high&mdash;that &s;he took her cour&s;e from the Alleghany, in order to deceive the Indians, as they would naturally pur&s;ue her that way; that day &s;he travelled along Conequene&s;&s;ing creek. The next day &s;he altered her cour&s;e, and, as &s;he be|lieves, fell upon the waters of Pine creek, which emp|ties into the Alleghany. Thinking this not her be&s;t cour&s;e, took over &s;ome dividing ridges, fell in on the heads of Squaw run, &s;he lay on a dividing ridge on Friday night, and on Saturday came to Squaw run, continued down the run until an Indian, or &s;ome other per&s;on &s;hot at a deer; &s;he &s;aw the per&s;on about one hundred and fifty yards from her, the deer running and the dog pur&s;uing it, which, from the appearance, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed to be an Indian dog.</P>
<P>She then altered her cour&s;e, but again came to the &s;ame run, and continued down it until &s;he got &s;o tired that &s;he was obliged to lie down, it having rained on
<PB N="18" REF="026540_0017_0FD093C7D2A21888">
her all that day and the night before; &s;he lay there that night, it rained con&s;tantly; on Sunday morning &s;he proceeded down the run until &s;he came to the Al|leghany river, and continued down the river till &s;he came oppo&s;ite to Carter's hou&s;e, on the inhabited &s;ide, where &s;he made a noi&s;e, and James Clo&s;ier brought her over the river to Carter's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>This deponent further &s;ays, that in conver&s;ing with one of the Indians, that could talk Engli&s;h very well, which &s;he &s;u&s;pects to be George Jelloway, he a&s;ked her if &s;he knew the pri&s;oner that was taken by Jeffers and his Seneccas, and in gaol in Pitt&s;burg? She an|&s;wered no&mdash;he &s;aid, you lie. She again &s;aid &s;he knew nothing about him; he &s;aid &s;he did, that he was a &s;py, and a great captain; that he took Butler's &s;calp, and that they would have him or twenty &s;calps; he again &s;aid, that they would exchange for him; that he and two more was &s;ent out to &s;ee what the Americans were doing; that they came round from Detroit to Venango; the Indian took paper, and &s;hewed her that he, at Fort Pitt, could write and draw on it;&mdash;he al&s;o a&s;ked her if a campaign was going out again&s;t the In|dians this &s;ummer&mdash;&s;he &s;aid no&mdash;he called her a liar, and &s;aid they were going out, and that the Indians would &s;erve them as they did la&s;t year; he al&s;o &s;aid the Engli&s;h had guns, ammunition, &amp;c. to give them to go to war, and that they had given them plenty la&s;t year; this deponent al&s;o says, that &s;he &s;aw one of the Indians have captain Crib's &s;word, which &s;he well knew. That one of the Indians a&s;ked her if &s;he knew Thomas Girty, &s;he &s;aid &s;he did&mdash;he then &s;aid that Girty lived near Fort Pitt; that he was a good man, but not as good as his brother at Detroit; but that his wife was a bad woman; &s;he tells lies on the Indians, and is a friend to America.

<HEAD>Sufferings of Peter William&s;on, one of the &s;ettlers in the back parts of Penn&s;ylvania. Written by him&s;elf.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS born within ten miles of the town of Aber|deen, in the north of Scotland, of reputable parents; at eight years of age, being a &s;turdy boy, I was taken notice of by two fellows belonging to a ve&s;&s;el, em|ployed (as the trade then was) by &s;ome of the worthy merchants of Aberdeen, in that villainous and execra|ble practice, of &s;tealing young children from their pa|rents, and &s;elling them as &s;laves in the plantations abroad, and on board the &s;hip ea&s;ily cajoled by them, where I was conducted between decks, to &s;ome others they had kidnapped in the &s;ame manner, and in about a month's time &s;et &s;ail for America. When arrived at Philadelphia, the captain &s;old us at about &s;ixteen pounds per head. What became of my unhappy com|panions I never knew; but it was my lot to be &s;old for &s;even years, to one of my countrymen, who had in his youth been kidnapped like my&s;elf, but from ano|ther town.</P>
<P>Having no children of his own, and commi&s;erating my condition, he took care of me, indulged me in going to &s;chool, where I went every winter for five years, and made a tolerable proficiency. With this good ma&s;ter, I continued till he died, and, as a re|ward for my faithful &s;ervice, he left me two hundred pounds currency, which was then about an hundred and twenty pounds &s;terling, his be&s;t hor&s;e, &s;addle, and all his wearing apparel.</P>
<P>Being now &s;eventeen years old, and my own ma&s;|ter, having money in my pocket, and all other nece&s;|&s;aries, I employed my&s;elf in jobbing for near &s;even years; when I re&s;olved to &s;ettle, and married the daughter of a &s;ub&s;tantial planter. My father-in-law made me a deed of gift of a tract of land that lay (un|happily for me, as it has &s;ince proved) on the frontiers of the province of Penn&s;ylvania, near the forks of De|laware,
<PB N="20" REF="026540_0019_0FD093CAC8BD4E00">
containing about two hundred acres, thirty of which were well cleared and fit for immediate u&s;e, on which were a good hou&s;e and barn. The place plea&s;ing me well, I &s;ettled on it. My money I expended in buying &s;tock, hou&s;hold furniture, and implements for out-of-door work; and being happy in a good wife, my felicity was compleat: but in 1754, the Indians, who had for a long time before ravaged and de&s;troyed other parts of America unmole&s;ted, began now to be very trouble&s;ome on the frontiers of our province, where they generally appeared in &s;mall &s;kulking par|ties, committing great deva&s;tations.</P>
<P>Terrible and &s;hocking to human nature were the barbarities daily committed by the&s;e &s;avages! Scarce did a day pa&s;s but &s;ome unhappy family or other fell victims to &s;avage cruelty. Terrible, indeed, it proved to me, as well as to many others; I that was now hap|py in an ea&s;y &s;tate of life, ble&s;&s;ed with an affectionate and tender wife, became on a &s;udden one of the mo&s;t unhappy of mankind: &s;carce can I &s;u&s;tain the &s;hock which for ever recurs on recollecting the fatal &s;econd of October, 1754. My wife that day went from home, to vi&s;it &s;ome of her relations; as I &s;taid up later than u&s;ual, expecting her return, none being in the hou&s;e be&s;ides my&s;elf, how great was my &s;urprize and terror, when about eleven o'clock at night, I heard the di&s;mal war|whoop of the &s;avages, and found that my hou&s;e was be&s;et by them. I flew to my chamber window, and perceived them to be twelve in number. Having my gun loaded, I threatened them with death, if they did not retire. But how vain and fruitle&s;s are the efforts of one man again&s;t the united force of &s;o many blood thir&s;ty mon&s;ters! One of them that could &s;peak Engli&s;h, threatened me in return, <Q>That if I did not come out, they would burn me alive,</Q> adding, however, <Q>That if I would come out and &s;urrender my&s;elf pri&s;oner, they would not kill me.</Q> In &s;uch deplorable circum|&s;tances, I cho&s;e to rely on their promi&s;es, rather than
<PB N="21" REF="026540_0020_0FD093CCCC635B30">
meet death by rejecting them; and accordingly went out of the hou&s;e, with my gun in my hand, not know|ing that I had it. Immediately on my approach they ru&s;hed on me like tigers, and in&s;tantly di&s;armed me. Having me thus in their power, they bound me to a tree, went into the hou&s;e, plundered it of every thing they could carry off, and then &s;et fire to it, and con|&s;umed what was left before my eyes. Not &s;atisfied with this, they &s;et fire to my barn, &s;table, and out-hou&s;es, wherein were about 200 bu&s;hels of wheat, &s;ix cows, four hor&s;es, and five &s;heep, all which were con&s;umed to a&s;hes.</P>
<P>Having thus fini&s;hed the execrable bu&s;ine&s;s, about which they came, one of the mon&s;ters came to me with a tomahawk <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A tomahawk is a kind of hatchet, made &s;omething like our plai&s;terers' hammers, about two feet long, handle and all. They generally u&s;e it after firing their guns, by ru&s;hing on their enemies, and fracturing or cleaving their &s;culls with it, and very &s;eldom fail of killing at the fir&s;t blow.</NOTE> and threatened me with the wor&s;t of deaths, if I would not go with them. This I agreed to, and then they untied me, and gave me a load to carry, under which I travelled all that night, full of the mo&s;t terrible apprehen&s;ions, le&s;t my unhappy wife &s;hould likewi&s;e have fallen into their cruel power. At day break, my infernal ma&s;ters ordered me to lay down my load, when tying my hands again round a tree, they forced the blood out at my fingers' ends. And then kindling a fire near the tree to which I was bound, the mo&s;t dreadful agonies &s;eized me, conclud|ing I was going to be made a &s;acrifice to their barba|rity. The fire being made, they for &s;ome time danced round me after their manner, whooping, hollowing and &s;hrieking in a frightful manner. Being &s;atisfied with this sort of mirth, they proceeded in another manner; taking the burning coals, and &s;ticks flaming with fire at the ends, holding them to my face, head hands,
<PB N="22" REF="026540_0021_0FD093CCD2657900">
and feet, and at the &s;ame time threatening to burn me entirely if I cried out: thus tortured as I was, almo&s;t to death, I &s;uffered their brutalities, without being al|lowed to vent my angui&s;h otherwi&s;e, than by &s;hedding &s;ilent tears; and the&s;e being ob&s;erved, they took fre&s;h coals, and applied them near my eyes, telling me my face was wet, and that they would dry it for me, which indeed they cruelly did. How I underwent the&s;e tortures has been matter of wonder to me, but God enabled me to wait with more than common pa|tience for the deliverance I daily prayed for.</P>
<P>At length they &s;at down round the fire, and roa&s;ted the meat, of which they had robbed my dwelling. When they had &s;upped, they offered &s;ome to me: though it may ea&s;ily be imagined I had but little appe|tite to eat, after the tortures and mi&s;eries I had &s;uffered, yet was I forced to &s;eem plea&s;ed with what they offered me, le&s;t by refu&s;ing it, they &s;hould re-a&s;&s;ume their hel|li&s;h practices. What I could not eat, I contrived to hide, they having unbound me till they imagined I had eat all; but then they bound me as before; in which de|plorable condition I was forced to continue the whole day. When the &s;un was &s;et, they put out the fire, and covered the a&s;hes with leaves, as is their u&s;ual cu&s;tom, that the white people might not di&s;cover any traces of their having been there.</P>
<P>Going from thence along the Su&s;quehanna, for the &s;pace of &s;ix miles, loaded as I was before, we arrived at a &s;pot near the Apalachian mountains, or Blue-hills, where they hid their plunder under logs of wood. From thence they proceeded to a neighbouring hou&s;e, occupied by one Jacob Snider and his unhappy family, con&s;i&s;ting of his wife, five children, and a young man his &s;ervant. They &s;oon got admittance into the unfor|tunate man's hou&s;e, where they immediately, without the lea&s;t remor&s;e, &s;calped both parents and children: nor could the tears, the &s;hrieks, or cries of poor inno|cent children, prevent their horrid ma&s;&s;acre: having
<PB N="23" REF="026540_0022_0FD093CE63B20FC0">
thus &s;calped them, and plundered the hou&s;e of every thing that was movable, they &s;et fire to it, and left the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed victims amid&s;t the flames.</P>
<P>Thinking the young man belonging to this unhappy family, would be of &s;ervice to them in carrying part of their plunder, they &s;pared his life, and loaded him and my&s;elf with what they had here got, and again marched to the Blue-hills, where they &s;towed their goods as before. My fellow &s;ufferer could not &s;upport the cruel treatment which we were obliged to &s;uffer, and complaining bitterly to me of his being unable to proceed any farther, I endeavoured to animate him, but all in vain, for he &s;till continued his moans and tears, which one of the &s;avages perceiving, as we travelled along, came up to us, and with his tomahawk gave him a blow on the head, which felled the unhappy youth to the ground, whom they immediately &s;calped and left. The &s;uddenne&s;s of this murder &s;hocked me to that degree, that I was in a manner motionle&s;s, expecting my fate would &s;oon be the &s;ame: however, recovering my di&s;tracted thoughts, I di&s;&s;embled my angui&s;h as well as I could from the barbarians; but &s;till, &s;uch was my terror, that for &s;ome time I &s;carce knew the days of the week, or what I did.</P>
<P>They &s;till kept on their cour&s;e near the mountains where they lay &s;kulking four or five days, rejoicing at the plunder they had got. When provi&s;ions became &s;carce, they made their way towards Su&s;quehanna, and pa&s;&s;ing near another hou&s;e, inhabited by an old man, who&s;e name was John Adams, with his wife and four &s;mall children, and meeting with no re&s;i&s;tance, they immediately &s;calped the mother and her children before the old man's eyes. Inhuman and horrid as this was, it did not &s;atisfy them; for when they had murdered the poor woman, they acted with her in &s;uch a brutal manner, as decency will not permit me to mention. The unhappy hu&s;band, not being able to avoid the &s;ight, intreated them to put an end to his mi&s;erable
<PB N="24" REF="026540_0023_0FD093D0A6A9A4E0">
being; but they were as deaf to the tears and entrea|ties of this venerable &s;ufferer, as they had been to tho&s;e of the others, and proceeded to burn and de&s;troy his hou&s;e, barn, corn, hay, cattle, and every thing the poor man, a few hours before, was ma&s;ter of. Having &s;aved what they thought proper from the flames, they gave the old man, feeble, weak, and in the mi&s;erable condition he then was, as well as my&s;elf, burdens to carry, and loading them&s;elves likewi&s;e with bread and meat, pur&s;ued their journey towards the Great Swamp. Here they lay for eight or nine days diverting them|&s;elves, at times, in barbarous cruelties on the old man; &s;ometimes they would &s;trip him naked, and paint him all over with various &s;orts of colours: at other times they would pluck the white hairs from his head, and tauntingly tell him, 'He was a fool for living &s;o long, and that they &s;hould &s;hew him kindne&s;s in putting him out of the world.' In vain were all his tears, for daily did they tire them&s;elves with the various means they tried to torment him; &s;ometimes tying him to a tree, and whipping him; at other times, &s;corching his furrowed cheeks with red-hot coals, and burning his legs quite to the knees. One night after he had been thus tormented, whil&s;t he and I were condoling each other at the mi&s;eries we daily &s;uffered, 25 other Indians arrived, bringing with them 20 &s;calps and 3 pri&s;oners, who had unhappily fallen into their hands in Conogocheague, a &s;mall town near the river Su&s;que|hanna, chiefly inhabited by the Iri&s;h. The&s;e pri&s;soners gave us &s;ome &s;hocking accounts of the murders and deva&s;tations committed in their parts; a few in&s;tances of which will enable the reader to gue&s;s at the treat|ment the provincials have &s;uffered for years pa&s;t. This party, who now joined us, had it not, I found, in their power to begin their violences &s;o &s;oon as tho&s;e who vi&s;ited my habitation; the fir&s;t of their tragedies being on the 25th of October, 1754, when John Lewis, with his wife and three &s;mall children, were
<PB N="25" REF="026540_0024_0FD093CE6A92D590">
inhumanly &s;calped and murdered; and his hou&s;e, barn, and every thing he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed burnt and de&s;troyed. On the 2<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">th, Jacob Miller, with his wife and &s;ix of his family, with every thing on his plantations, &s;hared the &s;ame fate. The 30th, the hou&s;e, mill, barn, 20 head of cattle, two teams of hor&s;es, and every thing belonging to George Folke, met with the like treat|ment, him&s;elf, wife, and all his mi&s;erable family, con&s;i&s;ting of nine in number, being &s;calped, then cut in pieces and given to the &s;wine. One of the &s;ub&s;tan|tial traders, belonging to the province, having bu&s;ine&s;s that called him &s;ome miles up the country, fell into the hands of these ruffians, who not only &s;calped him, but immediately roa&s;ted him before he was dead; then, like cannibals, for want of other food, eat his whole body, and of his head made, what they called, an In|dian pudding.</P>
<P>From the&s;e few in&s;tances of &s;avage cruelty, the de|plorable &s;ituation of the defencele&s;s inhabitants, and what they hourly &s;uffered in that part of the globe, mu&s;t &s;trike the utmo&s;t horror, and cau&s;e in every brea&s;t the utmo&s;t dete&s;tation, not only again&s;t the au|thors, but again&s;t tho&s;e who, through inattention, or pu&s;illanimous or erroneous principles, &s;uffered the&s;e &s;avages at fir&s;t, unrepelled, or even unmole&s;ted, to commit &s;uch ourages, depredations, and murders.</P>
<P>The three pri&s;oners that were brought with the&s;e additional forces, con&s;tantly repining at their lot, and almo&s;t dead with their exce&s;&s;ive hard treatment, con|trived at la&s;t to make their e&s;cape; but being far from their own &s;ettlements, and not knowing the country, were &s;oon after met by &s;ome others of the tribes, or na|tions at war with us, and brought back. The poor creatures, almo&s;t fami&s;hed for want of &s;u&s;tenance, having had none during the time of their e&s;cape, were no &s;ooner in the power of the barbarians, than two of them were tied to a tree, and a great fire made round them, where they remained till they were terribly
<PB N="26" REF="026540_0025_0FD093CE75D54BB8">
&s;corched and burnt; when one of the villains with his &s;calping knife, ripped open their bellies, took out their entrails, and burned them before their eyes, whil&s;t the others were cutting, piercing, and tearing the fle&s;h from their brea&s;ts, hands, arms, and legs, with red-hot irons, till they were dead. The third un|happy victim was re&s;erved a few hours longer, to be, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;acrificed in a more cruel manner; his arms were tied clo&s;e to his body, and a hole being dug, deep enough for him to &s;tand upright, he was put into it, and earth rammed and beat in all round his body up to his neck, &s;o that his head only appeared above ground; they then &s;calped him, and there let him remain for three or four hours, in the greate&s;t agonies; after which they made a &s;mall fire near his head, cau&s;ing him to &s;uffer the mo&s;t excruciating torments; whil&s;t the poor creature could only cry for mercy by killing him immediately, for his brains were boiling in his head; inexorable to all he &s;aid, they continued the fire, till his eyes gu&s;hed out of their &s;ockets; &s;uch ago|nizing torments did this unhappy creature &s;uffer for near two hours before he was quite dead. They then cut off his head, and buried it with the other bodies; my ta&s;k being to dig the graves; which, feeble and terrified as I was, the dread of &s;uffering the &s;ame fate enabled me to do.</P>
<P>A great &s;now now falling, the barbarians were fear|ful, le&s;t the white people should, by their tracks, find out their &s;kulking retreats, which obliged them to make the be&s;t of their way to their winter-quarters, about two hundred miles farther from any plantations or inhabitants. After a long and painful journey, being almo&s;t &s;tarved, I arrived with this infernal crew at Alamingo. There I found a number of wigwams, full of their women and children. Dancing, &s;inging, and &s;houting were their general amu&s;ements. And in all their fe&s;tivals and dances, they relate what &s;ucce&s;&s;es they have had, and what damages they have &s;u&s;tained

in their expeditions; in which I now unhappily be|came part of their theme. The &s;everity of the cold in|crea&s;ing, they &s;tripped me of my cloaths for their own u&s;e, and gave me &s;uch as they u&s;ually wore them&s;elves, being a piece of blanket, and a pair of mocka&s;ons, or &s;hoes, with a yard of coar&s;e cloth, to put round me in&s;tead of breeches.</P>
<P>At Alamingo I remained near two months, till the &s;now was off the ground. Whatever thoughts I might have of making my e&s;cape, to carry them into execu|tion was impracticable, being &s;o far from any planta|tions or white people, and the &s;evere weather render|ing my limbs in a manner quite &s;tiff and motionle&s;s: however, I contrived to defend my&s;elf again&s;t the in|clemency of the weather as well as I could, by making my&s;elf a little wigwam with the bark of the trees, covering it with earth, which made it re&s;emble a cave; and, to prevent the ill effects of the cold, I kept a good fire always near the door. My liberty of going about, was, indeed, more than I could have expected, but they well knew the impracticability of my e&s;cap|ing from them. Seeing me outwardly ea&s;y and &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ive, they would &s;ometimes give me a little meat, but my chief food was Indian corn. At length the time came when they were preparing them&s;elves for another expedition again&s;t the planters and white people; but before they &s;et out, they were joined by many other Indians.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the &s;now was quite gone, they &s;et forth on their journey towards the ba<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">k parts of the province of Penn&s;ylvania; all leaving their wives and children be|hind in their wigwams. They were now a formidable bo|dy, amounting to near 150. My bu&s;ine&s;s was to carry what they thought proper to load me with, but they never in|tru&s;ted me with a gun. We marched on &s;everal days without any thing particular occurring, almo&s;t fami&s;h|ed for want of provi&s;ions; for my part, I had nothing but a few &s;talks of Indian corn, which I was glad to
<PB N="28" REF="026540_0027_0FD093D55C802C50">
eat dry: nor did the Indians them&s;elves fare much better, for as we drew near the plantations they were afraid to kill any game, le&s;t the noi&s;e of their guns &s;hould alarm the inhabitants.</P>
<P>When we again arrived at the Blue-hills, about thirty miles from the Iri&s;h &s;ettlements before-men|tioned, we encamped for three days, though God knows, we had neither tents nor any thing el&s;e to de|fend us from the inclemency of the air, having nothing to lie on by night but the gra&s;s. Their u&s;ual method of lodging, pitching, or encamping, by night, being in parcels of ten or twelve men to a fire, where they lie upon the gra&s;s or bru&s;h, wrapped up in blanket, with their feet to the fire.</P>
<P>During our &s;tay here, a &s;ort of council of war was held, when it was agreed to divide them&s;elves into companies of about twenty men each; after which every captain marched with his party where he thought proper. I &s;till belonged to my old ma&s;ters, but was left behind on the mountains with ten Indians, to &s;tay till the re&s;t &s;hould return; not thinking it proper to carry me nearer to Conogocheague, or the other plan|tations.</P>
<P>Here I began to meditate an e&s;cape, and though I knew the country round extremely well, yet I was very cautious of giving the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of any &s;uch intention. However the third day after the grand body left us, my companions thought proper to traver&s;e the mountains in &s;earch of game for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, leav|ing me bound in &s;uch a manner that I could not e&s;cape: at night, when they returned, having unbound me, we all &s;at down together to &s;upper on what they had killed, and &s;oon after (being greatly fatigued with their day's excur&s;ion) they compo&s;ed them&s;elves to re&s;t, as u&s;ual. I now tried various ways to try whether it was a &s;cheme to prove my intentions or not; but after making a noi&s;e and walking about, &s;ometimes touch|ing them with my feet, I found there was no fallacy.
<PB N="29" REF="026540_0028_0FD093D74D8CB448">
Then I re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to get one of their guns, and, if di&s;covered, to die in my defence, rather than be taken: for that purpo&s;e I made various efforts to get one from under their heads (where they always &s;e|cured them) but in vain. Di&s;appointed in this, I began to de&s;pair of carrying my de&s;ign into execution: yet, after a little recollection, and tru&s;ting my&s;elf to the di|vine protection, I &s;et forwards, naked, and defencele&s;s as I was. Such was my terror, however, that in going from them I halted, and pau&s;ed every four or five yards, looking fearfully towards the &s;pot where I had left them, le&s;t they &s;hould awake and mi&s;s me; but when I was two hundred yards from them, I mended my pace, and made as much ha&s;te as I po&s;&s;ibly could to the foot of the mountains; when, on a &s;udden, I was &s;truck with the greate&s;t terror at hearing the wood-cry, as it is called, which the &s;avages I had left were making, upon mi&s;&s;ing their charge. The more my terror encrea&s;ed the fa&s;ter I pu&s;hed on, and, &s;carce knowing where I trod, drove through the woods with the utmo&s;t precipitation, &s;ometimes falling and brui&s;ing my&s;elf, cutting my feet and legs against the &s;tones in a mi&s;erable manner. But faint and maimed as I was I continued my flight till day-break, when, without having any thing to &s;u&s;tain nature, but a little corn left, I crept into a hollow tree, where I lay very &s;nug, and returned my prayers and thanks to the di|vine being, that had thus far favoured my e&s;cape. But my repo&s;e was in a few hours de&s;troyed at hearing the voice of the &s;avages near the place where I was hid, threatening and talking how they would u&s;e me, if they got me again. However, they at last left the &s;pot, where I heard them, and I remained in my apartment all that day without further mole&s;tation.</P>
<P>At night I ventured forwards again, frightened; thinking each twig that touched me a &s;avage. The third day I concealed my&s;elf in like manner as be|fore, and at night travelled, keeping off the main
<PB N="30" REF="026540_0029_0FD093D8CC886790">
road as much as po&s;&s;ible, which lengthened my journey many miles. But how &s;hall I de&s;cribe the terror I felt on the fourth night, when, by the ru&s;tling I made among the leaves, a party of Indians, that lay round a &s;mall fire, which I did not perceive, &s;tarted from the ground, and, &s;eizing their arms, ran from the fire among&s;t the woods. Whether to move forward or re&s;t where I was, I knew not, when to my great &s;urprize and joy, I was relieved by a parcel of &s;wine that made towards the place where I gue&s;&s;ed the &s;avages to be; who, on &s;eeing them, imagined that they had cau&s;ed the alarm, very merrily returned to the fire, and lay again down to &s;leep. Brui&s;ed, crippled, and terrified as I was, I pur&s;ued my journey till break of day, when, thinking my&s;elf &s;afe, I lay down under a great log, and &s;lept till about noon. Before evening I reached the &s;ummit of a great hill, and looking out if I could &s;py any habitations of white people, to my inexpre&s;&s;i|ble joy, I &s;aw &s;ome which I gue&s;&s;ed to be about ten miles di&s;tance.</P>
<P>In the morning I continued my journey towards the neare&s;t cleared lands I had &s;een the day before, and, about four o'clock in the afternoon, arrived at the hou&s;e of John Bell, an old acquaintance, where knock|ing at the door, his wi&s;e, who opened it, &s;eeing me in &s;uch a frightful condition, flew from me, &s;creaming, into the hou&s;e. This alarmed the whole family, who immedi|ately fled to their arms, and I was &s;oon acco&s;ted by the ma&s;ter with his gun in his hand. But on making my&s;elf known, (for he before took me to be an Indian) he immedi|ately care&s;&s;ed me, as did all his family with extraordinary friend&s;hip, the report of my being murdered by the &s;avages having reached them &s;ome months before. For two days and nights they very affectionately &s;up|plied me with all nece&s;&s;aries, and carefully attended me till my &s;pirits and limbs were pretty well recovered, and I thought my&s;elf able to ride, when I borrowed of the&s;e good people (who&s;e kindne&s;s merits my mo&s;t

<P>THERE is &s;eldom a more difficult ta&s;k undertaken by man, than the act of writing a narrative of a per&s;on's own life; e&s;pecially where the incident borders on the marvellous. Prodigies but &s;eldom happen; and the veracity of the relaters of them is &s;till le&s;s frequently vouched for; however, as the di&s;pen&s;ations of Provi|dence towards me have been too &s;triking not to make a deep and grateful impre&s;&s;ion, and as the principal part of them can be atte&s;ted to by living evidences, I &s;hall proceed, being confident that the candid reader will pardon the inaccuracies of an illiterate &s;oldier, and that the tender hearted will drop the tear of &s;ympathy, when they realize the idea of the &s;ufferings of &s;uch of our unfortunate country folks as fall into the hands of the we&s;tern Indians, who&s;e tender mercies are cruelties.</P>
<P>I was born and brought up at Falmouth, Ca&s;co-bay, where I re&s;ided until I attained to the &s;eventeenth year of my age. My parents were poor, the farm we occu|pied, &s;mall, and hard to cultivate, their family large and expen&s;ive, and every way fitted to &s;pare me to &s;eek
<PB N="32" REF="026540_0031_0FD093DBCB74C8F8">
a &s;eparate fortune; at lea&s;t the&s;e ideas had gained &s;o great an a&s;cendancy in my mind, that I determined, with the con&s;ent of my parents, to look out for a mean of &s;upporting my&s;elf.</P>
<P>Having fixed on the matter firmly, I took leave of my friends, and &s;ailed, the 1&s;t of May, 1791, on board a coa&s;ting &s;chooner for Bo&s;ton. Being arrived in this capital, and entirely out of employ, I had many unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations, and more than once &s;incerely wi&s;hed my&s;elf at home with my parents; however, as I had &s;et out on an important de&s;ign, and as yet met with no misfor|tune, pride kept me from this act, while nece&s;&s;ity urged me to fix &s;peedily on &s;ome mode of obtaining a liveli|hood.</P>
<P>My mind was &s;everely agitated on this &s;ubject one morning, when a young officer came into my room, and &s;oon entered into conver&s;ation on the plea&s;ures of a military life, the great chance there was for an active young man to obtain promotion, and the grand pro&s;pect opening for making great fortunes in the we&s;tern coun|try. His di&s;cour&s;e had the de&s;ired effect; for after treating me with a bowl or two of punch, I enli&s;ted, with a firm promi&s;e on his &s;ide to a&s;&s;i&s;t me in obtaining a &s;ergeant's warrant before the party left Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>An entire new &s;cene now opened before me. In&s;tead of becoming a &s;ergeant, I was treated &s;everely for my ignorance in a matter I had till then &s;carcely thought of, and in&s;ultingly ridiculed for remon&s;trating again&s;t the conduct of the officer. I &s;uffered great unea&s;ine&s;s on the&s;e and other accounts, of a &s;imilar kind, for &s;ome time; at length, convinced of the futility of complaint, I applied my&s;elf to &s;tudy the exerci&s;e, and in a few days became tolerable expert. The beginning of July we left Bo&s;ton, When we arrived at fort Wa&s;hington, I was ordered to join capt. Phelon's company, and in a few days &s;et out on the expedition under general Harmar. Tho&s;e alone who have experienced, can tell
<PB N="33" REF="026540_0032_0FD093DEE63A5C98">
what hard&s;hips, men undergo in &s;uch excur&s;ions, hun|ger, fatigue and toil were our con&s;tant attendants: however as our expectations were rai&s;ed with the idea of ea&s;y conque&s;t, rich plunder, and fine arms in the end, we made a &s;hift to be tolerably merry: for my own part, I had obtained a &s;ergeantcy, and flattered my&s;elf I was in the direct road to honour, fame and for|tune. Alas! how fluctuating are the &s;cenes of life! how &s;ingularly precarious the fortune of a &s;oldier! Before a &s;ingular opportunity pre&s;ented, in which I could have a chance to &s;ignalize my&s;elf, it was my lot to be taken in an ambu&s;cade, by a party of Kickappoo Indians, and with ten others con&s;trained to experience &s;cenes, in compari&s;on of which our former di&s;tre&s;&s;es &s;unk into nothing. We were taken on the bank of the Waba&s;h, and immediately conveyed to the upper Miami, at lea&s;t &s;uch of us as &s;urvived. The &s;econd day after we were taken, one of my companions, by the name of George Aikins, a native of Ireland, be|came &s;o faint with hunger and fatigue, that he could proceed no further. A &s;hort council was immediately held among the Indians who guarded us, the re&s;ult of which was that he &s;hould be put to death; this was no &s;ooner determined on, than a &s;cene of torture began. The captain of the guard approached the wretched victim who lay bound upon the ground, and with his knife made a circular inci&s;ion on the &s;cull; two others immediately pulled off the &s;calp; after this they each of them &s;truck him on the head with their tomahawks, they then &s;tripped him naked, &s;tabbed him with their knives in every &s;en&s;itive part of the body, and left him, weltering in blood, though not quite dead, a wretched victim to Indian rage and helli&s;h barbarity.</P>
<P>We were eight days on our march to the upper Mia|mi, during which painful travel, no pen can de&s;cribe our &s;ufferings from hunger, thir&s;t, and toil. We were met, at the entrance of the town, by above five hun|dred Indians, be&s;ides &s;quaws and children, who were
<PB N="34" REF="026540_0033_0FD093E3982F77A0">
apprized of our approach by a mo&s;t hideous yelling made by our guard, and an&s;wered repeatedly from the village. Here we were all &s;everely beaten by the Indi|ans, and four of our number, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> James Durgee, of Concord, Samuel For&s;ythe, of Beverly, Robert De|loy, of Marblehead, and Uzza Benton, of Salem, who all fainted under their heavy trials, were immediately &s;calped and tomahawked in our pre&s;ence, and tortured to death with every affliction of mi&s;ery that Indian in|genuity could invent.</P>
<P>It was the 4th of Augu&s;t when we were taken, and our unhappy companions were ma&s;&s;acred the thirteenth. News was that day received of the de&s;truction at L'An|guille, &amp;c. of general Harmar's army, numbers of &s;calps were exhibited by the warriors, and &s;everal pri|&s;oners, among whom were three women and &s;ix chil|dren, carried through the village de&s;tined to a Kickappoo &s;ettlement, further we&s;tward. The 15th of Augu&s;t, four more of my fellow pri&s;oners, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> Lemuel Saun|ders, of Bo&s;ton, Thomas Tharp, of Dorche&s;ter, Vin|cent Upham, of Mi&s;tick, and Younglove Croxal, of Abington, were taken from us; but whether they were ma&s;&s;acred or pre&s;erved alive, I am unable to &s;ay. After this nothing material occurred for a fortnight, except that we were &s;everal times &s;everely whipped on the receipt of bad news, and our allowance of provi&s;ions le&s;&s;ened, &s;o that we were apprehen&s;ive of &s;tarving to death, if we did not fall an immediate &s;acrifice to the fire or tomahawk: but heaven had otherwi&s;e decreed.</P>
<P>On the night following the 30th of Augu&s;t, our guard, which con&s;i&s;ted of four Indians, tired out with watching, laid down to &s;leep, leaving only an old &s;quaw to attend us. Providence &s;o ordered that my compa|nion had, by &s;ome means, got one of his hands at li|berty, and having a knife in his pocket, &s;oon cut the withes that bound his feet, and that which pinioned my arms, unperceived by the old &s;quaw, who &s;at in a drow&s;y po&s;ition, not &s;u&s;pecting harm, over a &s;mall fire in the wigwam.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="026540_0034_0FD093E15195EC30">
I ruminated but a few moments on our &s;ituation; there was no weapon near us, except my companion's knife, which he &s;till held, I looked on him to make him ob&s;erve me, and the &s;ame in&s;tant &s;prung and gra&s;ped the &s;quaw by the throat to prevent her making a noi&s;e, and my comrade in a moment cut her throat from ear to ear, down to the neck bone. He then &s;eized a tomahawk and my&s;elf a rifle, and &s;triking at the &s;ame in&s;tant, di&s;patched two of our enemies, the &s;ound of the&s;e blows awakened the others, but before they had time to ri&s;e, we renewed our &s;trokes on them, and luckily to &s;o good effect, as to &s;tun them, and then repeating the blow, we &s;unk a tomahawk in each of their heads, armed our&s;elves completely, and tak|ing what provi&s;ions the wigwam afforded, we commit|ted our&s;elves to the protection of Providence, and made the be&s;t of our way into the wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P>The compa&s;s of a volume would &s;carce contain the events of our progre&s;s through the wilderne&s;s; but as they were unintere&s;ting to any but us, I &s;hall only ob|&s;erve generally, that the difficulties of the journey, were too great to have been endured by any who had le&s;s intere&s;t than life at &s;take, or a le&s;s terrible enemy than Indians to fear. Hunger, thir&s;t, and fatigue, were our con&s;tant companions. We travelled hard day and night, except the few hours ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite for repo&s;e, that nature might not &s;ink under her oppre&s;|&s;ion, at which period one con&s;tantly watched while the other <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. In thi&s; tire&s;ome mode, we proceeded un|til the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">teenth of September, having often to &s;hift our direction on account of impa&s;&s;able bogs, deep mora&s;&s;es and hideous precipices, without meeting any adven|ture worthy note. On the morning of the fifteenth, as we were &s;teering nearly a north cour&s;e in order to avoid a bog that intercepted our cour&s;e, S.E. we found the bodies of one old man, a woman and two children newly murdered, &s;tript and &s;calped. This horrid &s;pec|tacle chilled our blood; we viewed the wretched vic|tims;
<PB N="36" REF="026540_0035_0FD093E37B0E4D28">
and from what we could collect from circum|&s;tances, we concluded that they had been dragged away from their homes, and their feet being worn out, had been inhumanly murdered, and left weltering in their blood. We were at a great lo&s;s now to determine what cour&s;e to &s;teer; at length we pitched upon a di|rection about northwe&s;t, and walked on as fa&s;t as po&s;|&s;ible to e&s;cape the &s;avages, if practicable. About noon this day, we came to a good &s;pring, which was a great relief to us; but which we had great rea&s;on a few minutes after to believe would be the la&s;t of our earthly comforts. My companion, Richard Sackville, a cor|poral of captain Newman's company, &s;tepped a&s;ide in|to the thicket, on &s;ome occa&s;ion, and returned with the account that a few rods di&s;tant he had di&s;covered four Indians with two mi&s;erable wretches bound, &s;it|ting under a tree eating; and that if I would join him, he would either relieve the captives, or peri&s;h in the attempt. The re&s;olution of my worthy comrade plea&s;|ed me greatly; and as no time was to be lo&s;t, we &s;et immediately about the execution of our de&s;ign: Sack|ville took the lead, and conducted me undi&s;covered, within fifty yards of the Indians; two of them were laid down, with their mu&s;quets in their arms, and ap|peared to be a&s;leep; the other two &s;at at the head of the pri&s;oners, their mu&s;quets re&s;ting again&s;t their left &s;houl|ders, and in their right hands each of them a toma|hawk, over the heads of their pri&s;oners. We each cho&s;e our man to fire at, and taking aim deliberately, had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee them both fall; the others in&s;tantly &s;tarted, and &s;eeming at a lo&s;s to determine from whence the a&s;&s;ault was made, &s;ell on their bellies, and looked carefully around to di&s;cover the be&s;t cour&s;e to take; mean time we had recharged, and &s;hifting our po&s;ition a little, impatiently waiting their ri&s;ing; in a minute they rai&s;ed on their hands and knees, and having as we &s;uppo&s;ed di&s;covered the &s;moke of our guns ri&s;ing above the bu&s;hes, attempted to crawl into
<PB N="37" REF="026540_0036_0FD093E675315710">
a thicket on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide. This gave us a good chance, and we again fired at different men, and with &s;uch effect, that we brought them both down; one lay motionle&s;s, the other crawled along a few yards, we loaded in an in&s;tant, and ru&s;hed towards him, yet keeping an eye on him, as he had reached him com|rade's gun, and &s;at upright in a po&s;ture of defence. By our noi&s;e in the bu&s;hes he di&s;covered the direction to fire; alas too fatally, for by his fatal &s;hot I lo&s;t my comrade and friend Sackville. At this moment the two pri&s;oners who were clo&s;e pinioned, endeavoured to make their e&s;cape towards me, but the de&s;perate &s;avage again fired, and &s;hot one of them dead, the other gained the thicket within a few yards of me: I had now once more got ready to fire, and di&s;charged at the wounded Indian; at this di&s;charge I wounded him in the neck, from whence I perceived the blood to flow &s;wiftly, but he yet undauntedly kept his seat, and having new charged his guns, fired upon us with them both, and then fell, &s;eemingly from faintne&s;s and lo&s;s of blood. I ran in&s;tant|ly to the pinioned white man, and having unbound his arms, and armed him with the unfortunate Sackville's mu&s;quet, we cautiou&s;ly approached a few yards nearer the wounded Indian; when I ordered my new comrade to fire, and we could perceive the &s;hot took effect. The &s;avage &s;till lay motionle&s;s. As &s;oon as my compa|nion had re-loaded, we approached the Indian, whom we found not quite dead, and a tomahawk in each hand, which he flouri&s;hed at us, &s;eemingly determined not to be taken alive. I, for my own part, determined to take him alive, if po&s;&s;ible; but my comrade p<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">|vented me by &s;hooting him through the body. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> enquired of my new companion what cour&s;e we ought to &s;teer, and whence the party came, from who&s;e power I had relieved him. He informed me with re&s;pect to the cour&s;e, which we immediately took, and on the way let me know, that we were within about three days march of fort Jeffer&s;on; that he and three others
<PB N="38" REF="026540_0037_0FD093E69B27D3F8">
were taken by a party of ten Waba&s;h Indians four days before, in the neighbourhood of that fort; that two of his companions being wounded, were immediately &s;calped and killed; that the party, at the time of tak|ing him, had in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;even other pri&s;oners, three of whom were committed to the charge of a party of four Indians. What became of them we knew not: the others being worn down with fatigue, were ma&s;&s;acred the day before, and which I found to be tho&s;e who&s;e bodies poor Sackville had di&s;covered in the thicket; that the other two Indians were gone to|wards the &s;ettlements, having &s;worn to kill certain per|&s;ons who&s;e names he had forgotten, and that de&s;truc|tion &s;eemed to be their whole drift.</P>
<P>My comrade, who&s;e name on enquiry, I found to be George Sexton, formerly a re&s;ident of Newport, Rhode-I&s;land, I found to be an excellent wood&s;man, and a man of great &s;pirit, and &s;o grateful for the deli|verance I had been in&s;trumental in obtaining for him, that he would not &s;uffer me to watch for him to &s;leep, but one hour in the four and twenty, although he was &s;o fatigued as to have ab&s;olute need of a much greater proportion; neither would permit me to carry any of our baggage.</P>
<P>From the time of being joined by Sexton, we &s;teer|ed a &s;outhea&s;t cour&s;e, as direct as po&s;&s;ible, until the 18th towards night, directing our cour&s;e by the &s;un and the mo&s;s on the trees by day, and the moon by night: on the evening of the 18th, we providentially fell in with an American &s;couting party, who conducted us &s;afely, in a few hours, to fort Jeffer&s;on, where we were treated with great humanity, and &s;upplied with the be&s;t refre&s;hments the fort afforded, which to me was very acceptable, as I had not ta&s;ted any thing ex|cept wild berries and ground nuts for above a week.</P>
<P>The week after our arrival at fort Jeffer&s;on, I was able to return to my duty in my own regiment, which the latter end of Augu&s;t joined the army on an expe|dition

again&s;t the Indians of the Miami Village, the place in which I had &s;uffered &s;o much, and &s;o recently, and where I had beheld &s;o many cruelties perpetrated on unfortunate Americans. It is ea&s;ier to conceive than de&s;cribe the perturbation of my mind on this oc|ca&s;ion. The ri&s;k I &s;hould run in common with my fellow &s;oldiers, &s;eemed heightened by the certainty of torture that awaited me in ca&s;e of being captured by the &s;avages. However, the&s;e reflections only occa&s;ioned a firm re&s;olution of doing my duty, vigilantly, and &s;ell|ing my life in action as dear as po&s;&s;ible, but by no means to be taken alive if I could evade it by any exertion &s;hort of &s;uicide.</P>
<P>My captain &s;hewed me every kindne&s;s in his power on the march, indulged me with a hor&s;e as often as po&s;&s;ible, and promi&s;ed to u&s;e his influence to obtain a commi&s;&s;ion for me, if I conducted well the pre&s;ent ex|pedition;&mdash;poor gentleman! little did he think he was &s;oon to expire gallantly fighting the battles of his coun|try! I ha&s;ten now to the mo&s;t intere&s;ting part of my &s;hort narrative, the de&s;cription of general St. Clair's defeat, and the &s;cenes which &s;ucceeded it.</P>
<P>On the 3d of November we arrived within a few miles of the Miami Village. Our army con&s;i&s;ted of about 1200 regular troops, and nearly an equal num|ber of militia. The night of the 3d, having rea&s;on to expect an attack, we were ordered under arms, about midnight, and kept in order until ju&s;t before day-light, at which time our &s;couts having been &s;ent out in va|rious directions, and no enemy di&s;covered, we were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the parade to take &s;ome refre&s;hment. The men in general, almo&s;t worn out with fatigue, had thrown them&s;elves down to repo&s;e a little: but their re&s;t was of &s;hort duration, for before &s;unri&s;se, the In|dians began a de&s;perate attack upon the militia, which &s;oon threw them into di&s;order, and forced them to re|tire precipitately, into the very heart of our camp.</P>
<P>Good God! what were my feelings, when, &s;tarting
<PB N="40" REF="026540_0039_0FD093E9B3AD0100">
from my &s;lumbers, I heard the mo&s;t tremendous firing all around, with yellings, horrid whoopings and ex|piring groans in dreadful di&s;cord &s;ounding in my ears. I &s;eized my arms, ran out of my tent with &s;everal of my comrades, and &s;aw the Indians with their bloody tomahawks and murderous knives butchering the fly|ing militia. I fled towards them, filled with de&s;pera|tion, di&s;charged my firelock among them, and had the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee one of the tawny &s;avages fall, who&s;e tomahawk was that in&s;tant elevated to &s;trike a gallant officer, then engaged &s;word in hand with a &s;avage in front. My example, I have rea&s;on to think, ani|mated my companions. Our own company now reached the place we occupied, and aided by the regu|lars of other companies and regiments, who joined us indi&s;criminately, we drove the Indians back into the bu&s;h, and &s;oon after formed in tolerable order, under as gallant commanders as ever died in defence of America. The firing cea&s;ed for a few minutes, but it was like the interval of a tornado, calculated by an in&s;tantaneous, dreadful rever&s;e, to &s;trike the deeper horror.&mdash;In one and the &s;ame minute &s;eemingly, the mo&s;t deadly and heavy firing took place on every part of our camp; the army, expo&s;ed to the &s;hot of the enemy, delivered from the ground, fell on every &s;ide, and drenched the plains with blood, while the discharge from our troops directed almo&s;t at random, I am fearful did but little execution. Orders were now given to charge with bayonets. We obeyed with alacrity; a dreadful &s;warm of tawny &s;avages ro&s;e from the ground, and fled before us; but alas! our officers, rendered con&s;picuous by their exertions to &s;timulate the men, became victims to &s;avage ingenuity, and fell so fa&s;t in common with the re&s;t, that &s;carce a &s;hot ap|peared as &s;pent in vain.&mdash;Advantages gained by the bayonet, were by this means, and want of due &s;upport, lo&s;t again, and our little corps obliged in turn, repeat|edly to give way before the Indians.&mdash;We were now

reduced to le&s;s than half our original number of regu|lar troops, and le&s;s than a fourth part of our officers, our hor&s;es all killed or taken, our artillery men all cut off, and the pieces in the enemy's hands; in this dreadful dilemma we had nothing to do but to attempt a retreat, which &s;oon became a flight, and for &s;everal miles, amid&s;t the yells of Indians, more dreadful to my ears, than &s;creams of damned fiends to my ideas, amid&s;t the groans of dying men, and the dreadful &s;ight of bloody ma&s;&s;acres on every &s;ide, perpetrated by the In|dians on the unfortunate creatures they overtook, I endured a degree of torture no tongue can de&s;cribe, or heart conceive; yet I providentially e&s;caped unhurt, and frequently di&s;charged my mu&s;ket, I am per&s;uaded to effect.</P>
<P>Providence was plea&s;ed to &s;u&s;tain my &s;pirits, and pre&s;erve my &s;trength; and although I had been &s;o far &s;pent previous to &s;etting out on the expedition, as to be unable to go upon fatigue for &s;everal days, or even to bear a moderate degree of exerci&s;e, I reached fort Jeffer&s;on the day after the action about ten in the morning, having travelled on foot all night to effect it.</P>
<P>Thus have I made the reader acquainted with the mo&s;t intere&s;ting &s;cenes of my life; many of them are extraordinary, &s;ome of them perhaps incredible; but all of them founded in fact, which can be atte&s;ted by numbers. General St. Clair, in con&s;equence of my &s;ufferings and what he and others were plea&s;ed to call &s;oldier-like exertions, pre&s;ented me with an en&s;ign's commi&s;&s;ion, on joining the remains of my old compa|ny, in which &s;tation I mean to &s;erve my country again, as far as my &s;lender abilities will permit; tru&s;ting that the &s;ame kind protecting providence, which hath covered my head in the day of battle, and &s;hielded me repeatedly in the hour of danger, will di&s;po&s;e of me as to infinite wi&s;dom &s;eems be&s;t; and if I die in the cau&s;e of my country, may the remembrance of my &s;uffer|ings, e&s;capes, per&s;everance through divine &s;upport, and

<HEAD>Account of the dreadful deva&s;tation of the Wyoming &s;ettle|ments, in July 1778. From Gordon's hi&s;tory of the American war.</HEAD>
<P>SO early as the 8th of February, 1778, general Schuyler wrote to congre&s;s&mdash;"There is too much rea&s;on to believe, that an expedition will be formed (by the Indians) again&s;t the we&s;tern frontiers of this &s;tate (New-York) Virginia and Penn&s;ylvania." The next month he informed them&mdash;"A number of Mo|hawks, and many of the Onondagoes, Cayugas, and Senecas, will commence ho&s;tilities again&s;t us as &s;oon as they can; it would be prudent therefore early to take mea&s;ures to carry the war into their country; it would require no greater body of troops to de&s;troy their towns than to protect the frontier inhabitants." No effectual mea&s;ures being taken to repre&s;s the ho&s;tile &s;pirit of the Indians, numbers joined the tory refugees, and with the&s;e commenced their horrid depredations and ho&s;tilities upon the back &s;ettlers, being headed by colonel Butler, and Brandt, an half blooded Indian, of de&s;perate courage, ferocious and cruel beyond exam|ple. Their expeditions were carried on to great ad|vantage by the exact knowledge which the refugees po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every object of their enterpri&s;e, and the immediate intelligence they received from their friends on the &s;pot. The weight of their ho&s;tilities fell upon
<PB N="43" REF="026540_0042_0FD093EDE2E8E3C0">
the fine, new and flouri&s;hing settlement of Wyoming, &s;ituated on the ea&s;tern branch of the Su&s;quehanna, in a mo&s;t beautiful country and delightful climate.&mdash;It was &s;ettled and cultivated with great ardor by a number of people from Connecticut, which claimed the territory as included in its original grant from Charles II. The &s;ettlement con&s;i&s;ted of eight town|&s;hips, each five miles &s;quare, beautifully placed on each &s;ide of the river. It had increa&s;ed &s;o by a rapid population, that the &s;ettlers &s;ent a thou&s;and men to &s;erve in the continental army. To provide again&s;t the dangers of their remote &s;ituation, four forts were con|&s;tructed to cover them from the irruptions of the In|dians. But it was their unhappine&s;s, to have a con&s;i|derable mixture of royali&s;ts among them; and the two parties were actuated by &s;entiments of the mo&s;t violent animo&s;ity, which was not confined to particular fami|lies or places; but creeping within the roofs and to the hearths and floors where it was lea&s;t to be expected, &s;erved equally to poi&s;on the &s;ources of dome&s;tic &s;ecurity and happine&s;s, and to cancel the laws of nature and humanity.</P>
<P>They had frequent and timely warnings of the dan|ger to which they were expo&s;ed by &s;ending their be&s;t men to &s;o great a di&s;tance. Their quiet had been in|terrupted by the Indians, joined by marauding parties of their own countrymen, in the preceding year; and it was only by a vigorous oppo&s;ition, in a cour&s;e of &s;uc|ce&s;sful &s;kirmi&s;hes, that they had been driven off. Se|veral tories, and others not before &s;u&s;pected, had then and &s;ince abandoned the &s;ettlement; and be&s;ide a per|fect knowledge of all their particular circum&s;tances, car|ried along with them &s;uch a &s;tock of private re&s;entment, as could not fail of directing the fury, and even giving an edge to the cruelty of their Indian and other invete|rate enemies. An unu&s;ual number of &s;trangers had come among them under various pretences, who&s;e be|haviour became &s;o &s;u&s;picious, that upon being taken up
<PB N="44" REF="026540_0043_0FD093F297A0DFB8">
and examined, &s;uch evidence appeared again&s;t &s;everal of them, of their acting in concert with the enemy, on a &s;cheme for the de&s;truction of the &s;ettlements, that about twenty were &s;ent off to Connecticut to be there impri&s;oned and tried for their lives, while the remainder were expelled. The&s;e mea&s;ures excited the rage of the tories in general to the mo&s;t extreme degree; and the threats formerly denounced again&s;t the &s;ettlers; were now renewed with aggravated vengeance.</P>
<P>As the time approached for the final cata&s;trophe, the Indians practi&s;ed unu&s;ual treachery. For &s;everal weeks previous to the intended attack, they repeatedly &s;ent &s;mall parties to the &s;ettlement, charged with the &s;tronge&s;t profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip. The&s;e parties, be|&s;ide attempting to lull the people in &s;ecurity, an&s;wered the purpo&s;es of communicating with their friends, and of ob&s;erving the pre&s;ent &s;tate of affairs. The &s;ettlers, however, were not in&s;en&s;ible to the danger. They had taken the alarm, and col. Zebulon Butler had &s;everal times written letters to congre&s;s and gen. Wa&s;hington, acquainting them with the danger the &s;ettlement was in, and reque&s;ting a&s;&s;i&s;tance; but the letters were never received, having been intercepted by the Penn&s;ylvania tories. A little before the main attack, &s;ome &s;mall parties made &s;udden irruptions, and committed &s;everal robberies and murders; and, from ignorance or a con|tempt of all ties whatever, ma&s;&s;acred the wife and five children of one of the per&s;ons &s;ent for trial to Connec|ticut, in their own cau&s;e.</P>
<P>At length, in the beginning of July, the enemy &s;ud|denly appeared in full force on the Su&s;quehanna <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> by col. John Butler, a Connecticut tory, and cou&s;in to col. Zeb. Butler, the &s;econd in command in the &s;et|tlement. He was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by mo&s;t of tho&s;e leaders, who had rendered them&s;elves terrible in the pre&s;ent frontier war. Their force was about 1600 men, near a fourth Indians, led by their own chiefs: the others were &s;o di&s;gui&s;ed and painted, as not to be di&s;tingui&s;hed
<PB N="45" REF="026540_0044_0FD093EF6954BFE0">
from the Indians, excepting their officers, who, being dre&s;&s;ed in regimentals, carried the appearance of regu|lars. One of the &s;maller forts, garri&s;oned chiefly by tories, was given up or rather betrayed. Another was taken by &s;torm, and all but the women and children ma&s;&s;acred in the mo&s;t inhuman manner.</P>
<P>Colonel Zeb. Butler, leaving a &s;mall number to guard fort Wilke&s;borough, cro&s;&s;ed the river with about 400 men, and marched into King&s;ton fort, whither the women, children and defencele&s;s of all sorts crowded for protection. He &s;uffered him&s;elf to be enticed by his cou&s;in a abandon the fortre&s;s. He agreed to march out, and hold a conference with the enemy in the open field (at &s;o great a di&s;tance from the fort, as to &s;hut out all po&s;&s;ibility of protection from it) upon their with|drawing, according to their own propo&s;al, in order to the holding of a parley for the conclu&s;ion of a treaty. He at the &s;ame time marched out about 400 men well arm|ed, being nearly the whole &s;trength of the garri&s;on, to guard his per&s;on to the place of parley, &s;uch was his di&s;tru&s;t of the enemy's de&s;igns. On his arrival he found nobody to treat with, and yet advanced toward the foot of the mountain, where at a di&s;tance he &s;aw a flag, the holders of which, &s;eemingly afraid of treachery on his &s;ide, retired as he advanced; whil&s;t he, endeavouring to remove this pretended ill-impre&s;&s;ion, pur&s;ued the flag, till his party was thoroughly enclo&s;ed, when he was &s;uddenly freed from his delu&s;ion, by finding it attacked at once on every &s;ide. He and his men, not|with&s;tanding the &s;urpri&s;e and danger, fought with re|&s;olution and bravery, and kept up &s;o continual and heavy a fire for three quarters of an hour, that they &s;eemed to gain a marked &s;uperiority. In this critical moment, a &s;oldier through a &s;udden impul&s;e of &s;ear, or premeditated treachery, cried out aloud&mdash;"the colonel has ordered a retreat." The fate of the party was now at once determined. In the &s;tate of confu|&s;ion that en&s;ued, an unre&s;i&s;ted &s;laughter commenced,
<PB N="46" REF="026540_0045_0FD093F0F44E55C8">
while the enemy broke in on all &s;ides without ob&s;truc|tion. Col. Zeb. Butler, and about &s;eventy of his men e&s;caped; the latter got acro&s;s the river to fort Wilke&s;bo|rough, the colonel made his way to fort King&s;ton; which was inve&s;ted the next day on the land &s;ide. The enemy, to &s;adden the drooping &s;pirits of the weak remaining garri&s;on, &s;ent in, for their contemplation, the bloody &s;calps of a hundred and ninety-&s;ix of their late friends and comrades. They kept up a continual fi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> upon the fort the whole day. In the evening the colonel quitted the fort and went down the river with his family. He is thought to be the only officer that e&s;caped.</P>
<P>Colonel Nathan Denni&s;on, who &s;ucceeded to the command, &s;eeing the impo&s;&s;iblity of an effectual de|fence, went with a flag to col. John Butler, to know what terms he would grant on a &s;urrender: to which application Butler an&s;wered with more than &s;avage phlegm in two &s;hort words&mdash;<HI>the hatchet.</HI> Denni&s;on having defended the fort, till mo&s;t of the garri&s;on were killed or di&s;abled, was compelled to &s;urrender at di&s;cretion. Some of the unhappy per&s;ons in the fort were carried away alive; but the barbarous con|querors, to &s;ave the trouble of murder in detail, &s;hut up the re&s;t promi&s;cuou&s;ly in the hou&s;es and barracks; which having &s;et on fire, they enjoyed the &s;avage plea&s;ure of beholding the whole con&s;umed in one ge|neral blaze.</P>
<P>They then cro&s;&s;ed the river to the only remaining fort, Wilke&s;borough, which, in hopes of mercy, &s;ur|rendered without demanding any conditions. They found about &s;eventy continental &s;oldiers, who had been engaged merely for the defence of the frontiers, whom they butchered with every circum&s;tance of horrid cruelty. The remainder of the men, with the women and children, were &s;hut up as before in the hou&s;es, which being &s;et on fire, they peri&s;hed altogether in the flames.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="026540_0046_0FD093F491C940D0">
A general &s;cene of deva&s;tation was now &s;pread through all the town&s;hips. Fire, &s;word, and the other different in&s;truments of de&s;truction alternately triumph|ed. The &s;ettlements of the tories alone generally e&s;caped, and appeared as i&s;lands in the mid&s;t of the &s;urround|ing ruin. The mercile&s;s ravagers having de&s;troyed the main objects of their cruelty, directed their animosity to every part of living nature belonging to them; &s;hot and de&s;troyed &s;ome of their cattle, and cut out the tongues of others, leaving them &s;till alive to prolong their agonies.</P>
<P>The following are a few of the more &s;ingular circum|&s;tances of the barbarity practi&s;ed in the attack upon Wyoming. Capt. Bedlock, who had been taken pri|&s;oner, being &s;tripped naked, had his body &s;tuck full of &s;plinters of pine knots, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pine knots are &s;o replete with turpentine, that they are fired and u&s;ed at night to illuminate the room; and lighted &s;plinters are often carried about in the hou&s;es of the Carolina planters in&s;tead of candles.</NOTE> and then a heap of pine knots piled around him; the whole was then &s;et on fire, and his two companions, capts. Ran&s;on and Durgee, thrown alive into the flames and held down with pitchforks. The returned tories, who had at different times aban|doned the &s;ettlement in order to join in tho&s;e &s;avage ex|peditions, were the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed for their cruelty; in this they re&s;embled the tories that joined the Briti&s;h forces. One of the&s;e Wyoming tories, who&s;e mother had married a &s;econd hu&s;band, butchered with his own hands, both her, his father-in-law, his own &s;i&s;ters and their infant children. Another, who during his ab&s;ence had &s;ent home &s;everal threats again&s;t the life of his fa|ther, now not only realized them in per&s;on, but was him&s;elf, with his own hands, the exterminator of his whole family, mother, brothers and &s;i&s;ters and min|gled their blood in one common carnage, with that of the ancient hu&s;band and father. The broken parts and &s;cattered relics of families, con&s;i&s;ting mo&s;tly of
<PB N="48" REF="026540_0047_0FD093F713B9D1E8">
women and children, who had e&s;caped to the woods during the different &s;cenes of this deva&s;tation, &s;uffered little le&s;s than their friends, who had peri&s;hed in the ruin of their hou&s;es. Di&s;per&s;ed and wandering in the fore&s;ts, as chance and fear directed, without provi|&s;ion or covering, they had a long tract of country to traver&s;e, and many without doubt peri&s;hed in the woods.</P>
