<HEAD>A FUNERAL ELEGY Upon the Death of that Excellent and most worthy Gentleman John Winthrop <ABBR>Esq.</ABBR> Late Governour of his Majestyes Colony of Conecticot; Who deceased April, 1676.</HEAD>
<LG>
<HEAD>Anagr. John Winthrop, Oh Print Wo nih:</HEAD>
<L>LEt woe be printed nigh unto our Land,</L>
<L>Since that Jehovahs formidable hand</L>
<L>Hath been bereaving us this fatal year,</L>
<L>Of such a Star within our Hemisphere.</L>
<L>A Star of such resplendent glorious Light,</L>
<L>Whose Fellow never yet approacht our sight</L>
<L>Nor ever are we like his Peer to see</L>
<L>In all his comprehensive rarity.</L>
<L>A pretious Pillar in his earthly station,</L>
<L>A pious servant to his Generation,</L>
<L>Although his Extract was sublime and high,</L>
<L>Yet was he cloathed with humility.</L>
<L>His place of bearing Rule it was so sweet,</L>
<L>That Justice did with mercy in him meet.</L>
<L>His Learning was so grand that all may ghess</L>
<L>Our <HI>Winthrop'</HI>s Master of the Languages,</L>
<L>Whose travail's far into out-landish places,</L>
<L>They did augment his other worthy graces.</L>
<L>And lest his Gallantry should seem to fall,</L>
<L>Behold his worth in matters Physical;</L>
<L>My Pen can never fully it rehearse,</L>
<L>Whose Fame did overrun the Universe.</L>
<L>His Powders, Cordials, and his <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Pills.</L>
<L>O're flew the Mountains, and the lasting Hills.</L>
<L>So pregnant was his skill, none can discry,</L>
<L>And lofty Judgement into Chimistry.</L>
<L>Incomparable was the depth he had</L>
<L>In rare Inventions, sons of men to glad.</L>
<L>When <HI>Hartfords</HI> Charter was in some suspence</L>
<L>This worthy <HI>Heroe</HI> must away from hence.</L>
<L>Our Jurisdiction rightly to maintain,</L>
<L>And mediate before his Sovereign:</L>
<L>For which great Service who so fit as He,</L>
<L>One of th' Imperial Society.</L>
<L>A man of wisdome, Patience, Love, and Peace,</L>
<L>To Rich and poor his virtues did encrease,</L>
<L>His labour and his dealings were so free,</L>
<L>That none did more abound in Charity,</L>
<L>His Remedyes they did not only tend</L>
<L>Unto mens bodies, but a better end.</L>
<L>When Subdivisions in the Church did rise,</L>
<L>He had great skill to heal their Maladies.</L>
<L>Surcease my mournful Muse, further to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></L>
<L>Of this great Patriot, unless I had</L>
<L><HI>Briarius</HI> hands to set his virtues forth,</L>
<L>And <HI>Argus</HI> Eyes to weep his golden worth.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<HEAD>ACCROSTICON.</HEAD>
<L>INvironed with grief well be we may,</L>
<L>On every side in such a cloudy day,</L>
<L>He being gone who was our Countryes glory,</L>
<L>Not to return which make our hearts so sorry.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Woe and alass unto our Colonyes,</L>
<L>In middest of our other miseryes,</L>
<L>No mortal can express what dolour 'tis,</L>
<L>To be bereav'd of such a Gem as this.</L>
<L>Himself could only let us understand,</L>
<L>Rightly to value such a heavy hand;</L>
<L>Oh may this dismal loss ne'r be forgot,</L>
<L><HI>Per Plimouth, Boston,</HI> and <HI>Conecticot.</HI></L>
</LG>

<HEAD>EPITAPH.</HEAD>
<L>H<HI>Ere lyes a None-such for all virtuous things,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Fittest to be discoursed of by Kings.</HI></L>
