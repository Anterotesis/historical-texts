<Q>To extend the Governour's Right to command, and Subjects Duty to obey, beyond the Laws of One's Country, is Trea&s;on again&s;t the Con&s;titution, and Treachery to the Society whereof we are Members: And, to di&s;&s;olve the Ties by which Princes stand confined; and overthrow the Hedges, by which the re&s;erved Rights, Privileges, and Properties of the Subjects are fenced about, tempts every Prince to become a Tyrant, and to make all his Subjects Slaves.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_THE <HI>annual Election</HI> of your Re|pre&s;entatives drawing nigh, and the Importance of a good Electi|on, being greater than is gene|rally imagin'd, (nothing le&s;s than the <HI>civil Salvation of the People</HI> depending upon the <HI>&s;ame</HI>) has induced me, together with the Reque&s;t of many of your Friends, to lay before you, the Nece&s;&s;ity of u&s;ing the greate&s;t Care in your &s;everal <HI>Elections,</HI> not only from the great Danger of a <HI>bad One</HI> at all Times, but al|&s;o from the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> Circum&s;tances of the Province.</P>
<P>In order to comply with this their Reque&s;t, and to &s;et before you the Danger <HI>you</HI> and <HI>your Posterity</HI> are brought into by a <HI>bad Election</HI>; I have publi&s;h'd this Letter, in which I have made u&s;e of &s;ome Helps from <HI>Cato</HI>'s <HI>Letters,</HI> which were wrote upon the glorious Cau&s;e of Liberty, and have been ju&s;tly re|garded by all wi&s;e Men of every Party; and there|fore,
<PB N="2" REF="004334_0004_10045B58AE96A2C0">
what is done here in Imitation of tho&s;e valu|able Letters, cannot be judged to be factious, or again&s;t the Intere&s;t of the Publick.</P>
<P>But, however &s;ome may receive <HI>this,</HI> I am &s;ure, every true Lover of his Country, (who has Hone&s;ty and Wi&s;dom enough to refu&s;e any Bribe offered him as an Equivalent for the lea&s;t Priviledge of his Coun|try) will approve of it, and govern him&s;elf accor|dingly in voting.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>You are born to Liberty, as you are <HI>Engli&s;h Men,</HI> and as you are <HI>De&s;cendents</HI> of the <HI>fir&s;t worthy Setlers</HI> of this Country, who purcha&s;ed <HI>their</HI> and <HI>your</HI> Liber|ties, at the mo&s;t invaluable Price of their <HI>Blood</HI> and <HI>Trea&s;ure</HI>; it is therefore your Intere&s;t, and your Duty to Po&s;terity, to pre&s;erve them entire, without &s;uffering the lea&s;t Breach to be made on them.</P>
<P>The Con&s;titution, which you live under, is an E|pitome of a mixed Monarchy, where your Gover|nors have every Right to protect and defend you; none to injure or oppre&s;s you. You have a large Share in the Legi&s;lature; you have the &s;ole Power over your Pur&s;es: But it depends upon your&s;elves alone, to make the&s;e Rights of your's, the&s;e noble Priviledges of U&s;e to you. And in order to make this plain to you, I &s;hall recount &s;ome of the Privi|ledges you enjoy by your <HI>Charter,</HI> and &s;hew what a Part you have in the Government; as the End of it is, and ought to be, wholly for your Advantage.</P>
<P>The <HI>Charter</HI> ordains, that you &s;hall have a General A&s;&s;embly, convened, held and kept, every la&s;t Wed|ne&s;day in <HI>May,</HI> which &s;hall con&s;i&s;t of the Governor and Council for the Time being, and of &s;uch Free|holders, as &s;hall be elected and deputed from time to time, by the major Part of the Freeholders, and other Inhabitants qualified to vote in that Choice, pre&s;ent at &s;uch Election. This General A&s;&s;embly, at their fir&s;t Meeting, proceed to elect twenty eight Coun|cellors; after which Election, they proceed to make
<PB N="3" REF="004334_0005_10045B5F4BE4DC60">
what Laws may be nece&s;&s;ary for the publick Good, to rai&s;e what Moneys may be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport the Government, in defending and protecting you this is the &s;ole <HI>Priviledge</HI> of your Repre&s;entatives. To levy and a&s;&s;e&s;s rea&s;onable Taxes and A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments upon your Poles and E&s;tates, is another Priviledge of your Repre&s;entatives. The General A&s;&s;embly have the Right of di&s;po&s;ing of the wa&s;te Lands. The Con&s;ent of your Repre&s;entatives is ab&s;olutely ne+ce&s;&s;ary in all Acts of Government, and many of them mu&s;t originate in the Hou&s;e, e&s;pecially tho&s;e mate|rial Articles of <HI>&s;upplying the Trea&s;ury</HI> and <HI>taxing the People.</HI></P>
<P>By this you may &s;ee the great Share you have in the Government, having at lea&s;t two Branches of the Ligi&s;lature (who have all the Moneys and other Advantages in their Power) which are appointed by your Election. Your Repre&s;entatives (who are immediately of your Appointment) are the Tru&s;tees of your Liberties, who, if they give up, or are in|clined to give up any the lea&s;t of them, you have it in your Power, the next Year, to choo&s;e more faith|ful Men in their Room; and &s;uch Repre&s;entatives will choo&s;e &s;uch Councellors, and then all will be well. For not only good Care will be taken, that no Laws but &s;uch as are for your Good and Welfare &s;hall be enacted; but al&s;o, that none be tru&s;ted with the Execution of them, except tho&s;e who have Com|petent Under&s;tanding and Integrity. Such a Gene|ral A&s;&s;embly (which depends upon your Election of Repre&s;entatives) will be very tender of the lea&s;t Priviledge, and will keep a proper Guard upon en|croaching Prerogative. They will be able properly to di&s;tingui&s;h between the <HI>invaluable Priviledges</HI> granted by <HI>Charter,</HI> and the In&s;tructions given to a Governour, and will know they have no Bu&s;ine&s;s with In&s;tructions (<HI>except from the People</HI>) and that any Compliance with an In&s;truction which is contra|ry to the Charter, is a traiterous giving up the Li|berties

of their Country, and an Abu&s;e upon his Ma|je&s;ty. For although it be one of the wi&s;e and pru|dent Maxims of the Engli&s;h Government, '<HI>That no Blame or Wrong be imputed to the King</HI>'; it is al&s;o a|nother, '<HI>That no Wrong be done to the People</HI>'. They will know, that the only Rule of their Government ought to be your Good, and that they are inviolably obliged to keep a watchful Eye upon your Charter, as their Directory, and to &s;ee that no Infraction be made on it. <HI>That being your Con&s;titution,</HI> from &s;uch a Behaviour in your Legi&s;lature, you may naturally expect, his Maje&s;ty's Council (who con&s;titute the middle Branch) will, in giving their Con&s;ent to the Appointment of civil Officers, be actuated by the &s;ame good Principles, they were, as a Branch of the Legi&s;lature; and con&s;equently, they will not con|&s;ent to the Appointment of an unqualified Per&s;on to an executive Office in the Government, nor to the Removal of any Judge, unle&s;s he has been guilty of Malefeazance in his Office. It was <HI>(Gentlemen,)</HI> one of the material Ble&s;&s;ings obtained at the happy Revolution, that the Tenour of the Judges Com|mi&s;&s;ions in <HI>England,</HI> &s;hould be altered, from <HI>during Plea&s;ure,</HI> to, <HI>&s;o long as they behave well.</HI> The Crown having the Power of creating and removing Judges at Plea&s;ure, was found by fatal Experience, to be one of the greate&s;t Misfortunes the Nation laboured under; the Law being always expounded in Favour of the Crown, from whence aro&s;e the Doctrines of <HI>di&s;pen&s;ing Power,</HI> the <HI>Forfeitures of Charters,</HI> and ma|ny other &s;lavi&s;h ones, de&s;tructive of Liberty, which produced the Nation's Delivery from Slavery by King <HI>William</HI> of immortal Memory; who re&s;tored to our <HI>Forefathers</HI> their Priviledges, that they lo&s;t in the common Calamity of tho&s;e Times, which &s;o much endeared that glorious <HI>Deliverer</HI> to tho&s;e Wor|thies, that there was not then, as there &s;care is now, a <HI>Jacobite</HI> to be found in the whole Province; &s;o that we can vie with any of his Maje&s;ty's Subjects for Loyalty.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="004334_0007_1004178F203FFB40">You have here &s;een &s;ome &s;mall Sketch of your happy <HI>Con&s;titution</HI> by the Charter, which confirms to you all the Priviledges of <HI>Engli&s;h Men</HI>; and as a Reward for your <HI>Ance&s;tors</HI> great Merit in &s;etling this Country, adds many others, giving you a larger in the Government, than the People in <HI>England</HI> have. The Improvement of which depends upon you whol|ly; for to pre&s;erve your Liberties, they mu&s;t be kept up in their whole Strength. And to this End&punc; it lies upon you to choo&s;e for your Repre&s;entatives, Men that will be really <HI>&s;uch</HI>; Men that you can't &s;uppo&s;e will be ignorant or carele&s;s of your Intere&s;ts; or what is much wor&s;e, that will act quite contra|ry to them.</P>
<P>For Names <HI>(Gentlemen,)</HI> will not defend you, when the Thing &s;ignified by them is gone. The <HI>Em|perors</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> were as ab&s;olute with the Shew of a <HI>Senate,</HI> and the Appearance of the People's choo&s;ing their <HI>Praetors, Tribunes,</HI> and other <HI>Officers</HI> of the <HI>Common Wealth,</HI> as the <HI>Ea&s;tern Monarchs</HI> are now, without the&s;e &s;eeming Checks, and this Shew of Liberty; and in &s;ome Re&s;pects, they were more &s;e|cure; as the Infamy of their Tyranny was &s;hared by tho&s;e A&s;&s;emblies, the Advantages were all their own, and the Condition of the People was rather wor&s;e for the&s;e mock <HI>Magi&s;trates,</HI> and pretended Repre&s;entatives; who, under the Colour and Title of the Protectors of the People, were, at the People's Expence, the real Helpers and Partakers of the Ini|quity of the Tyrant. The Kings of <HI>France</HI> have <HI>Parliaments,</HI> but Parliaments which dare not di&s;pute their Royal Plea&s;ure; and the poor People would not fare one Jot the better, if the&s;e Parliaments were bribed not to di&s;pute it.</P>
<P><HI>This wretched Ca&s;e,</HI> Gentlemen, <HI>will be yours, and the wretched Ca&s;e of your Po&s;terity,</HI> if ever an ambiti|ous or de&s;igning Governour &s;hall, hereafter be able to <HI>corrupt</HI> or <HI>awe</HI> your Repre&s;entatives.

at <HI>your Expence,</HI> and you mu&s;t pay the terrible Rec|koning at la&s;t. It requires therefore your be&s;t Tho'ts, and mo&s;t vigorous Re&s;olutions, to pre&s;erve your Con|&s;titution entire in all its Parts, without &s;uffering any one Part to prevail &s;o far over the other, as to re|duce it in Effect, tho' not in Name, to a &s;imple Form of Government, which is always <HI>Tyranny.</HI> It will be immaterial to you, whether this is brought about by <HI>Confederacy,</HI> or by <HI>Force</HI>; by <HI>Knaves,</HI> or <HI>Fools</HI>; whatever be the villainous Means, <HI>Violence, Oppre&s;&s;i|on,</HI> and every Rank of Evil will be the End. Where|fore, with an hone&s;t and generous De&s;ign of &s;aving your Country, you ought to choo&s;e Repre&s;entatives, who&s;e Intere&s;ts are at pre&s;ent the &s;ame with your own, and likely to continue the &s;ame. Repre&s;enta|tives, who are not already pre-engaged, nor, from their <HI>Circum&s;tances, Profe&s;&s;ion, Offices, and Manner of Life,</HI> are likely to be engaged in a contrary Intere&s;t. He will prove but a &s;orry Advocate, who takes Fees from your Adver&s;ary; and as indifferent a <HI>Plenipo|tentiary,</HI> who receivs a Pen&s;ion from the <HI>Prince,</HI> whom, he is commi&s;&s;ioned to treat with&punc; Nor can there be any Security in the <HI>Fidelity</HI> of One, who can find it more his Intere&s;t to <HI>betray</HI> you, than to <HI>&s;erve</HI> you faithfully. <HI>Vertue</HI> and <HI>Vice</HI> will be but ill ballanced, when Profits and Honours are thrown into the wrong Scale. A great <HI>Protestant Peer of France,</HI> having changed his Religion, in Compliance with his Ma&s;ter <HI>Henry</HI> the 4th of <HI>France,</HI> who had changed too, was &s;oon after asked by that <HI>Monarch</HI> publickly, which of the two Religions he thought the be&s;t? <HI>The Protestant, Sir, undoubtedly, &s;aid the Peer, by your own royal Confe&s;&s;ion, &s;ince in Exchange for it, your Majesty has given me Popery and a Mar|&s;hal's Staff to Boot.</HI> Where Boot is given, there is al|ways a tacit Confe&s;&s;ion that the Exchange is unequal without it.

<P><PB N="7" REF="004334_0009_10045B76D7D7AEF8">It is the Right and Duty of the Electors, to exa|mine into the Conduct, and to know the Opinions and Intentions of tho&s;e, who offer them&s;elves to their Choice.

For you may depend upon it, they can't act as free Agents; and what the Con&s;equence of that in a few Years will be, you may judge from what has already happen'd to you. By this, you find Laws enacted without this e&s;&s;ential Clau&s;e in them, viz. <HI>Any Law, U&s;age, or Cu&s;tom to the contrary notwith&s;tanding</HI>; which is a repealing Clau&s;e: But this is left out, becau&s;e, the Governour has an In&s;truction to con&s;ent to no re|pealing Act whatever; which is depriving you of one of your be&s;t Privileges, being nothing le&s;s, than taking from the General A&s;&s;embly the whole legi&s;la|tive Power granted them by the royal Charter; for it ever will be a fundamental Maxim in <HI>Politicks,</HI> &mdash;That <HI>the &s;ame Power</HI> which can <HI>enact,</HI> can either <HI>alter</HI> or <HI>abrogate</HI>: &mdash;According to which, If our Ge|neral A&s;&s;embly have no Power to <HI>repeal,</HI> they never had a Power to <HI>enact</HI>; from whence it will nece&s;&s;a|rily follow, That our whole Body of Laws are <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> null and void. This mean Compliance with In&s;tructions, is the Root and Foundation of all your heavy Sufferings, and may yet produce wor&s;e and more heavy; whereas an hone&s;t Non-compliance with an In&s;truction, which infringes upon your Li|berties, will be a con&s;iderable Security to them, by being never troubled with it again, unle&s;s now and then by Way of <HI>Scarecrow,</HI> as you have been with the In&s;truction for fixing the Salary.</P>

Becau&s;e, Coveteou&s;ne&s;s is a Vice, that even the Mi&s;er him&s;elf would have the World believe he de&s;pi&s;es; whereas, Power and Honour are allowed to be admired by all.

It can't be rea&s;onably thought, that they, when they get into Power, will do more again&s;t them&s;elves, their Friends, and the Governour's Friends, than they did again&s;t a Man, whom they would have gladly curtailed in his Fees, but that they feared it would have been made u&s;e of as a Precedent, to have prevented their, &amp; their Friends intended Oppre&s;&s;ion&punc; This glaring In&s;tance mu&s;t al|ways &s;tare them in the Face, and give them the Lie, when they pretend to &s;ay they are for any other new Regulation of Fees, than what &s;hall be in fa|vour of the Officers. No! <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> Tell them <HI>In|tere&s;t will not lie,</HI> and you are not to be deceived; and that upon this Maxim you will act in your en&s;uing Election. Tell them you are not quite &s;o blind, as not to &s;ee, That as your Trade decays, the Number of Candidates for every Vacancy will daily encrea&s;e, which mu&s;t give <HI>Prerogative</HI> a con&s;iderable Advan|tage over <HI>Liberty.</HI> Tell them, all the additional Profit rai&s;ed by this new Money mu&s;t come from you, and &s;o add double Weight in the Scale of Pre|rogative (which is heavy enough already) again&s;t Liberty; and that this ought to make you con&s;ider, what large Strides Prerogative will be daily making towards ab&s;olute and de&s;potick Power, when it is &s;o con&s;iderably augmented, and the Supports of Liber|ty &s;o much enfeebled.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI> It highly imports you to con&s;ider what you are about, and whether you will bring Life or Death upon us. Oh! Take Care of your|&s;elves, and of us all: We are all in <HI>your Hands,</HI> and &s;o at pre&s;ent are your Repre&s;entatives. But very quickly the Scene will be &s;hifted, both you and we &s;hall be in their's.</P>
<P>Choo&s;e therefore hone&s;t Freemen, who when they have been your Repre&s;entatives, have followed your In&s;tructions, taken Care of your Privileges, and have &s;howed them&s;elves firmly attached to the be&s;t Inte|re&s;ts

of their Country, and have been as tender of your Liberties, religious and civil, as of the Apple of their Eyes.</P>
<P>Choo&s;e Men of good moral Characters, who have always in their Dealings in <HI>Meum et Tuum</HI> acted hone&s;tly; for it is a great Hazard, whether he who would cheat his Neighbour of <HI>Twenty Pounds,</HI> will not fell his Country for <HI>Judas</HI>'s Price.</P>
<P>Choo&s;e &s;uch as have always &s;hewn them&s;elves, and are likely to continue, your fa&s;t Friends; who have oppo&s;ed every unju&s;t Exaction of your civil Officers, and have almo&s;t &s;tood alone for your Sakes, in the Pro&s;ecution of &s;uch Officers for that Offence.</P>
<P>Choo&s;e &s;uch as are mo&s;t likely to relieve you from &s;uch Burthens, under which we all &s;adly groan, and under which we mu&s;t certainly &s;ink, never to ri&s;e again, if we are not relieved.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED><HI>I am, Gentlemen, With exceeding Sincerity, and all good Wi&s;hes, Your most affectionate Humble Servant,</HI> AMERICANUS.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
