<P>"PRAY what does the author mean?" is the fir&s;t que&s;tion mo&s;t readers will a&s;k, and the la&s;t they are able to an&s;wer. Therefore in a word I will explain the &s;ubject and de&s;ign of the following poem.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject is the &s;tate of the times in regard to literature and religion. The author was prompt|ed to write by a hope that it might be of u&s;e to point out, in a clear, conci&s;e, and &s;triking manner, tho&s;e general errors, that hinder the advantages of education, and the growth of piety. The &s;ubject is inexhau&s;tible; nor is my de&s;ign yet completed. This fir&s;t part de&s;cribes the principal mi&s;takes in one cour&s;e of life, and exemplifies the following well-known truth, That to the frequent &s;candal, as well of religion, as learning, a fellow, without any &s;hare of genius, or application to &s;tudy, may pa&s;s with credit through life, receive the honors of a liberal education, and be admitted to the right hand of fellow&s;hip among mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel. That, except in one neighbouring province, ignorance wanders unmole&s;ted at our colleges, examinations are dwindled to mere form and ceremony, and after four years dozing there, no one is ever refu&s;ed the honors of a degree, on account of dulne&s;s and in|&s;ufficiency. That the <HI>meer</HI> knowledge of antient
<PB N="vi" REF="013050_0004_0F8FF665397EA0C0">
languages, of the ab&s;tru&s;er parts of mathematics, and the dark re&s;earches of metaphy&s;ics, is of little advantage in any bu&s;ine&s;s or profe&s;&s;ion in life. That it would be more beneficial, in every place of public education, to take pains in teaching the elements of oratory, the grammar of the Engli&s;h tongue, and the elegancies of &s;tyle, and compo&s;i|tion. That in numberle&s;s in&s;tances throughout the&s;e colonies, &s;ufficient care hath not been taken to exclude the ignorant and irreligious, from the &s;acred de&s;k. That this tenderne&s;s to the unde|&s;erving, tends to deba&s;e the dignity of the clergy, and to hinder many worthy men from undertaking the office of the mini&s;try. And that the virulent controver&s;ies of the pre&s;ent day concerning reli|gious, or in many ca&s;es, meerly &s;peculative opi|nions, &s;avouring &s;o highly of vanity and o&s;tenta|tion, and breathing a &s;pirit &s;o oppo&s;ite to chri&s;|tian benevolence, have done more hurt to the cau&s;e of religion, than all the malice, the ridicule, and the folly of its enemies.</P>
