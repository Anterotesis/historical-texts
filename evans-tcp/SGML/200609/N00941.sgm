falling into Tears. I was now going to say. <HI>Tears, where are you?</HI> But something better I am to call for. There is no concern of our <HI>Inward</HI> or <HI>Outward</HI> man, wherein our <HI>Faith</HI> is not necessary, ser|viceable, advantageous. A good mans <HI>Faith,</HI> is a good mans <HI>Life.</HI> It is a Sen|tence of the <HI>Old,</HI> often repeated in the <HI>New- Testament: The Just by Faith shall live.</HI> How? But by his <HI>Faith.</HI> Behold our <HI>Inward man:</HI> By <HI>Faith</HI> 'tis that we are to <HI>receive the gift of Righteousness through Jesus Christ:</HI> By <HI>Faith</HI> it is that we get <HI>power to become the Children of God:</HI> By <HI>Faith</HI> it is that our <HI>hearts are purified:</HI> By <HI>Faith</HI> it is that we have a <HI>Victory over the World:</HI> And by <HI>Faith</HI> it is that we come to the <HI>End of our Faith, the Salvation of our Souls.</HI> Behold our <HI>Outward man!</HI> By <HI>Faith</HI> it is that we are to <HI>bear</HI> all that God layes upon us; and by Faith it is that we are to <HI>gain</HI> by what we bear. Nothing is to be done without <HI>Faith;</HI> No <HI>Living</HI> without it, nor any <HI>Dying</HI> without it. Admire not that it is in this Chapter so very admirably recommended unto us. It was a very true assertion of a Great Re|former, that the <HI>meanest action done in
<PB N="3" REF="001127_0008_0FB05EB892261E40">
Faith</HI> upon the <HI>Command,</HI> and in <HI>Faith</HI> up on the <HI>Promise</HI> of God, is a more noble thing, than the most celebrated Victories of an <HI>Alexander,</HI> or a <HI>Caesar.</HI> But I am sure then, the Chapter before us is a nar|rative of the most noble things in the world; they are the most Renowned <HI>Actions</HI> that ever were, and performed by the most Renowned <HI>Persons;</HI> In short, what <HI>Faith</HI> can do is here set before us. What it <HI>can do,</HI> is demonstrated, from what it <HI>hath done</HI> already. The Chapter is a <HI>Chronicle</HI> of Christian <HI>Faith;</HI> and an History of the <HI>Heroical</HI> Acts produced &amp; performed by such a <HI>Faith.</HI> After the Apostle had mentioned the <HI>Patriarchs</HI> in Common, as famous for their <HI>Faith,</HI> he comes to instance <HI>Abraham</HI> in particular. There were many tryals given to the Faith of <HI>Abraham;</HI> The <HI>Tenth</HI> (as they use to fancy of the Waves) was the biggest and hardest of them all; a <HI>tryal</HI> in <HI>Isaac</HI> his <HI>only Son.</HI> There are three things in the Text before us.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Occasion</HI> of the <HI>Tryal.</HI> We read <HI>Gen.</HI> 22. 1. <HI>God did tempt Abraham.</HI> How can <HI>Temptation</HI> be ascribed unto <HI>God<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> There are two sorts of sit. There is;
<PB N="4" REF="001127_0009_0FB05EBA4A329880">
<HI>Tentatio probationis,</HI> and there <HI>is, Tentatio perditionis.</HI> Indeed it is also where said, <HI>No man is tempted of God,</HI> that is as to a <HI>Temptation</HI> of <HI>perdition</HI> God never does dispose or incline or seduce, any man to <HI>Sin</HI> against his Maker, or to <HI>wound</HI> his own Soul. But then there is a <HI>Temptation</HI> of <HI>Probation;</HI> a <HI>Temptation</HI> wherein God <HI>proves</HI> what men are, <HI>proves</HI> whether they <HI>are</HI> the metal they seem to be, <HI>proves</HI> whether they can <HI>do</HI> what they pretend unto. This is from God.</P>
<P>The Tryal of <HI>Abraham</HI> was by an <HI>Ex|traordinary Command.</HI> There is no <HI>Injust|ice</HI> in it, that the Supream <HI>Law giver</HI> of the World, whose <HI>Will</HI> is the highest Rule o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> what is <HI>Right,</HI> should give <HI>new Laws</HI> to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n as he pleases; and that he should alter and repeal any <HI>former Laws</HI> that he hath given to them. <HI>Abraham</HI> understood well, That the Law giver who does <HI>re|quire</HI> that we <HI>do no Murder,</HI> has the prero|gative to <HI>Declare</HI> also <HI>What is Murder.</HI> He understood, That the Soveraign Arbited of Life and Death, may order who a|mong the Children of men shall Dy, and <HI>when</HI> and <HI>how,</HI> as it pleases Him. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> man ask, How <HI>Abraham</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">

<HI>know,</HI> there was no <HI>Delusion</HI> in this <HI>Injun|ction.</HI> I answer, he infallibly knew it; and suppose I should say, there is a way infallibly to know it, but that no tongue is able to express it! Until I can hear a man so describe what <HI>Light</HI> is &amp; what <HI>Fire</HI> it, as to make a Blind man apprehend it, I can't imagine that a man should in significant and sufficient words distinguish <HI>Communion with the Invisible World:</HI> And there is a way plain to the <HI>Sense</HI> of those that <HI>have</HI> it. But, I think, I may give yet a little clearer Account of it, than so. There is a certain <HI>Bright Cloud of Heaven,</HI> of quite another consistence than that which drops our ordinary <HI>Rain</HI> upon us. That <HI>Cloud</HI> was filled with the <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Fire,</HI> where in the <HI>Son of God,</HI> chose to Lodge as His <HI>Covering</HI> from the Beginning, that so He might therein Exhibit Himself with an a|greeable <HI>Majesty</HI> unto His People. 'Tis the same that was called, the SHECHI|NAH; those flaming <HI>Angels</HI> of the Lord, which are called, <HI>The Angels of His Presence,</HI> attended it; and it was of old seen by the <HI>People</HI> of God, on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> great Occa|sions.

And such was the <HI>Glory of the Lord</HI> in the Appearance, that it was impossible to be counterfeited. But why must <HI>Abraham</HI> thus be <HI>tryed?</HI> One well expresses it. <HI>Non ut ipse Hominem invent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">at, sed ut Homo se inve|niat;</HI> It was not that <HI>God</HI> might know what was in <HI>Abraham,</HI> No, but that <HI>Abraham</HI> should know what was in <HI>himself;</HI> and that all the <HI>Children of Abraham</HI> also might know, for their future Instruction.</P>
<P N="2">2. We have the <HI>Difficulty</HI> of the <HI>Tryal.</HI> It was, I suppose, the most Exquisite one that ever befell a mortal man: will you hear it, Gen. 22 2. <HI>Take now thy Son, thy only Son, Isaac, whom thon lovest, and get thee into the Land of Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt offering, upon one of the Mountains, which I will tell thee of.</HI> To part with our Children is oftentimes a hard thing. We read of a Mother when she saw her Son a dying, <HI>A Sword passed through her Soul.</HI> Be|hold here a Thousand Swords making their passes all at once.

We read, Gen. 22. 3. <HI>Abraham rose early,</HI> and went about it. There is many a man, the God of Heaven says to him, <HI>Come, and take my Son, that HE may save thy Soul!</HI> but the man <HI>puts it off</HI> till another <HI>Day</HI> or <HI>Week:</HI> whenas <HI>Abraham</HI> when God sayes, <HI>Go, let thy Son dye, and suffer thou an horrible wound in thy Soul!</HI> He goes away <HI>immedi|ately</HI> about it. <HI>Abraham offers his Son.</HI> The <HI>will</HI> for the <HI>Deed,</HI> was Gods way of <HI>trying</HI> his People from the beginning. The Thing was <HI>accepted,</HI> though <HI>prevented.</HI> Mark, by the way, that some Hearty and Serious <HI>purposes</HI> are <HI>performances</HI> in the sight of God. On the one side, you that have a <HI>purpose</HI> of Sin against God, may to your cost find that very purpose to be the <HI>Sin.

Thus on the other side; you that have a <HI>purpose</HI> to serve the God of Heaven, God may ac|count it as a <HI>performance.</HI> When <HI>David sat in his house</HI> and Thought, <HI>What shalt I do for the House of God?</HI> God sent that message to him, Well, <HI>David,</HI> I take it as if really

But if a man has his Heart sincere|ly set for God and Christ, and thereupon he has many a <HI>purpose</HI> for God working &amp; formed in his Heart, suppose the Lord may deny that man an <HI>Opportunity</HI> to do what he purposed, yet he will reward that <HI>Pur|pose</HI> gloriously.

But <HI>why</HI> so? Lest we be the <HI>Unworthy receivers</HI> of the <HI>Mysteries;</HI> lest we be found <HI>without a Wedding Garment</HI> at the <HI>Feast</HI> of the Immoral King; lest we do but <HI>Eat Judgment to our selves</HI> by <HI>Sacramen|tal Prophanations.</HI> Having thus advanced this point, that <HI>Self Tryal</HI> is always a need|ful, and <HI>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">w</HI> a most needful thing, I am to tell you that among all the <HI>Marks</HI> for our <HI>Tryal of our selves,</HI> none are more sensible than those that are drawn from our beha|viour under our <HI>Tryals from the Hand of God.</HI> We are to <HI>Try our selves,</HI> whether we <HI>Fear God,</HI> or no; and that will be best known by our carriage when God is by Afflictions <HI>Trying</HI> of us. An instance thereof we have in the words newly read

unto us. In the Context, we have the Story of <HI>Abraham</HI> offering up his <HI>Isaac</HI> unto God, at the <HI>Call</HI> of the Lord. Our Father <HI>Abraham</HI> underwent Nine very Famous Tryals from the alwise God; But he was now brought unto a <HI>Tenth.</HI> We have our Father <HI>Abraham</HI> here <HI>Tryed,</HI> every vein of his heart; and it was under the considera|tion of a <HI>Father,</HI> that he underwent the <HI>Tryal.</HI> The <HI>Tryal</HI> ordered for that great <HI>man of God,</HI> was a most afflictive <HI>Tryal.</HI> It was that of parting with a <HI>Child</HI> singularly dear unto him. You shall hear the demand of God, are hear so many claps of Thun|der in every article of that Command; seven or eight very penetrating stings me|thinks aculeate it. Cen. 22. 2 <HI>Take now thy Son, thine only Son, Isaac, whom thou lovest, &amp; get thee into the Land of Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the Mountains which I will tell thee of.</HI> Here was the demand. There follow in the Story especially two things.</P>
<P N="1">1. We have the good mans <HI>Obedience.</HI> This is more largely repeated in this Chap|ter; but more <HI>briefly</HI> in that Chapter on a passage whereof some of you may remem|ber we discoursed a few Mon his ago. Heb. 11.17

Let us design for the Name of God, as much as ever we can. It may be God will permit us to accom|plish our designs; yet if he do not, they shan't be <HI>lost.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2.

<P>The First Proposition.</P>
<P><HI>That the Afflictions which the Good God sends upon good men are for the Tryal of those men</HI></P>
<P>In this one, we may behold Three As|sertions.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>God men</HI> must see much <HI>Evil of Af|flictions</HI> in this <HI>present evil World.</HI> Tis said, Psal 31. 19. <HI>Many are the Afflictions of the Righteous:</HI> and God is <HI>not unrighteous</HI> in or|daining and effecting that it shall be so. Although <HI>Righteousness does deliver from Death,</HI> namely from that which alone is

worthy to be called by the name of <HI>Death.</HI> Yet the <HI>Righteous</HI> are to <HI>dye,</HI> and to under|go the <HI>Advancements</HI> of <HI>Death</HI> in the <HI>Af|flictions</HI> of <HI>Life.</HI> The Children of <HI>Abraham</HI> are also the Children of <HI>Israel;</HI> even of that <HI>Israel</HI> who says, Gen. 47. 9. <HI>Few and Evil have been the dayes of the years of my Pilgri|mage.</HI> Good men are afflicted every way. Sometimes they are afflicted in <HI>Relations.</HI> Thus a <HI>Jacob</HI> has his <HI>Children,</HI> some <HI>Dead,</HI> and some almost worse than <HI>Dead,</HI> while they <HI>Live.</HI> Sometimes they are afflicted, in their <HI>Spirits.</HI> Thus an <HI>Heman</HI> crys out. <HI>While I suffer the terrors of God I am distracted,</HI> Sometimes they are afflicted in their <HI>Bodies.</HI> Thus a <HI>Timothy</HI> has his <HI>often infirmities</HI> to be complained of. Sometimes they are af|flicted in their <HI>Estates.</HI> Thus a <HI>Naomi</HI> must say, <HI>I was full, but am become empty.</HI> Sometimes they are afflicted in their <HI>Names.</HI> Thus an <HI>Elijah</HI> must be called, <HI>A Troubler of Israel.</HI> Yea, sometimes <HI>one good man is</HI> afflicted in <HI>all</HI> these Instances! a <HI>David</HI> af|flicted in <HI>all</HI> a <HI>Job</HI> in <HI>all,</HI> a <HI>Paul</HI> in <HI>all;</HI> yet they not the <HI>worse men</HI> for that. It is a|mong the names put upon the People of God, Isa. 54. 11. <HI>O thou afflicted and tossed with Tempests</HI> When are we like to see

2. Every <HI>Affliction</HI> that comes on good men has in it a <HI>Tryal</HI> of those men. Our Afflictions are our <HI>Probations,</HI> Indeed all the Providence of God unto the Children of men are <HI>Probations.</HI> Our <HI>Enjoyments</HI> are our <HI>Tryals.</HI> 'Tis said, Prov. 27. 21. <HI>As the fining pet for silver, and the furnace for Gold so is a man to his praise.</HI> I choose to read it this, <HI>So the mouth that praises a|ny one is to try him.</HI> When we are <HI>praised</HI> by our Neighbours, we are Tryed in those <HI>praises.</HI> And thus, when we are <HI>Blessed</HI> by our Maker we are tryed in those <HI>blessings. Honours</HI> from below, they do, <HI>Indicare virum,</HI> or <HI>Try</HI> what mettal the man is made of; they Try whether the man can bear Sail without <HI>Over set|ing,</HI> and have power to oppress without growing absolutely <HI>mad:</HI> So <HI>Mercies</HI> from above, do the like.

whether when we <HI>wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> fat we will grow wanton and kick against him,</HI> or no.

Our Afflictions</HI> are our <HI>Tryals</HI> we are thrown into a <HI>fiery Furnace</HI> when Tryed by God with Afflictions.

3.

And <HI>the whole Scripture is profitable,</HI> for our <HI>Instructi|on</HI> in this Devotion; to <HI>Instruct</HI> us for <HI>Self-Examination.</HI> And especially the <HI>First E|pistle</HI> of <HI>John,</HI> seems to be special portion of Scripture, for <HI>Self Examination;</HI> That Epistle may well be our <HI>Vade Mecum,</HI> when we go to <HI>Examine our selves.</HI></P>
<P>Or, that I may approach a Little closer to the point that lies before us. Would we know, <HI>Whether we have the Fear of God, or no?</HI> There are many <HI>Tokens</HI> to help us in our <HI>Tryal&punc;</HI> but that which is mostly to be pressed on us is, <HI>What is our behaviour under Afflictive Tryals?</HI> There we come to the 
<PB N="45" REF="001127_0050_0FB05F0ECBFFAF90">
Case that lyes before us. In all our Af|flictions our <HI>Flesh</HI> is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> yea but when we encounter the Cross handsomely, and Christianly, and Piously, <HI>that</HI> shews that we have more than <HI>Flesh</HI> in us. They that are all <HI>Flesh</HI> can't bear what contradicts the <HI>Flesh.</HI> But when we can patiently have our <HI>Flesh</HI> crossed by the <HI>Hand</HI> of God, and the <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Sight</HI> of God enable us to bear it, there is more than <HI>Flesh</HI> in such a man.</P>
<P>The Case is This.</P>
<P><HI>What is that behaviour under Afflictive Tryals, which may be a comfortable Argument and Evidence of our having the Fear of God?</HI></P>
<P>For answer, in General,</P>
<P>To shew the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> we must have <HI>another sort of Behaviour,</HI> than what is in the most of man, when under their <HI>Af|flictions. Nehemiah</HI> spoke at this rate, Others did so and so, Neh. 5. 15. <HI>But so did not I because of the Fear of God</HI> Others in their Afflictions are <HI>froward;</HI> but, <HI>so must not we be because of the Fear of God.</HI> Others under their Afflictions are <HI>hopeless;</HI> but, <HI>so must not we be because of the Fear of God.</HI> Others under their Afflictions <HI>got nothing</HI> by them; they that were <HI>Ungodly</HI> are so still, they that were Carnal, and Worldly, and Profane

do still continue so; but, <HI>so must not we be|cause of the Fear of God.</HI> Yea, the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> under our Afflictions, is to make us <HI>do more than others.</HI> Our Lord sayes to us in our Afflictions, What do you <HI>more than others?</HI> Except we <HI>do more,</HI> we can't prove that we have the <HI>Fear of God.</HI> I shall offer a few <HI>Questions</HI> in <HI>Answer</HI> to this Case: <HI>Try</HI> your selves by those Questi|ons, in the <HI>Fear of God,</HI> I beseech you, I entreat you.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> 1. Under our <HI>Tryals,</HI> is the <HI>Hand of God</HI> very sensible unto us in the ordering of our Tryals? Tis said of the Impious, Isa. 26. 11. <HI>Lord, when thy hand is lifted up they will not see:</HI> They charge all on the <HI>neglect</HI> of <HI>men,</HI> or the <HI>malice</HI> of <HI>men,</HI> or on the concurrence of <HI>second Causes&punc;</HI> But what a thing is this?

Do we not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the Creature our <HI>Horizon,</HI> that our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> shall terminate <HI>there,</HI> for the <HI>Original</HI> of our <HI>Afflictions?</HI> When our possessions are laid in the <HI>Dust,</HI> or in the Ground, do we think that the Afflictions came only <HI>out of the dust,</HI> or out of <HI>the ground?</HI> Under <HI>Be|reavements,</HI> Do we say like <HI>Job,</HI> Job 1. 21.
<PB N="47" REF="001127_0052_0FB05F14B2920798">
<HI>It is the Lord that hath taken away, blessed be his name.</HI> Under our <HI>Calamities,</HI> do we say with <HI>David,</HI> 2 Sam 16. 10. <HI>It is the Lord that hath bidden it</HI> Does the <HI>First Cause</HI> of all take up all our Thoughts? Do all our Thoughts run in such a strain as that, <HI>I have to do with God in this Thing, I am concerned with God chiefly, yea with God only, in what is come to pass?</HI> now I know that thou fearest God.</P>
<P><HI>Quest</HI> II. Do our <HI>Tryals</HI> drive us more Heartily, Fervently, Constantly, to <HI>seek the Face</HI> of God who sends the Tryals? The wicked, they are to Prayer, like the <HI>Chil|drens Tops,</HI> no longer stirring than the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ash|es are upon them. Indeed they will <HI>Pray in their Afflictions</HI> many times. We read, Isa 26 16. <HI>in Trouble they will visit God, and pour out a Prayer.</HI> So did <HI>Ahab,</HI> and so did <HI>Magus,</HI> of old! But how? Not from an <HI>internal Principle:</HI> They have not an af|fection for Prayer: They go to it but as <HI>driven;</HI> and their Prayer is no <HI>Prayer.</HI> Tis said Job 27. 9, 10 <HI>Will God b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">r his cry, when Trouble cometh on him? W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> he delight himself in the Almighty? Will be alwayes call upon God?</HI> If he call upon God; tis not with any <HI>Delight.</HI> How is it with us?
<PB N="48" REF="001127_0053_0FB05F17C5446768">
The Children of God have a <HI>Principle</HI> in them, called <HI>A Spirit of Prayer.</HI> Is that <HI>Spi|rit now awakened,</HI> and move more Vigorous than ever before? When any thing ails us, do we naturally go to God about it, as <HI>Children to a Father?</HI> It may be the <HI>Spirit,</HI> of <HI>God</HI> and of <HI>Prayer,</HI> was flatted in us be|fore such Afflictions came upon us; but upon the first assault of our Afflictions, do we fall to Prayer immediately at the old rate and more than so? Are we like <HI>Da|vid,</HI> who said, Psal 116 3, 4 <HI>I found Trou|ble and Sorrow, the sorrows of Death compas|sed me; Then I called on the Name of the Lord, O Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my Soul.</HI> Are we like <HI>Paul</HI> who said, 2 Cor. 28 9 I <HI>had a Messenger of Satan to buffet m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, but I be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> Lord thrice.</HI> The more <HI>Sorrowful</HI> thee more <HI>Prayerful?</HI> Now I know that thou fearest God!</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> III. Do we in all our <HI>Tryals</HI> hum|bly acknowledge and reverence the <HI>Righ|teousness</HI> of God, whereby the Tryals are inflicted? Whatever Affliction come upon us, do we never say, <HI>We have an hard Por|tion?</HI> Is it with us as with them, Lam. 3. 39. <HI>Why should a living man complain; a man for the Punishment of his Sin.</HI> In the
<PB N="49" REF="001127_0054_0FB05F194AB3CEA0">
midst of all our <HI>Lamentations,</HI> do we think, <HI>This is the punishment of my sin!</HI> and then do we say, <HI>I will never complain of this!</HI> Do we say as <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> Ch. 9. 33. <HI>Thou art Just in all that is brought on us!</HI> Yea, as Ezra, Ch. 9 13. <HI>Thou hast punished us far less than our Iniquities have deserved!</HI> Tho' there come a <HI>Sea</HI> of Trouble, on us, do we see and say, <HI>There's not one drop of In|justice in all that Sea?</HI> Whatever Affliction we meet withal, is that still the language of our Souls, <HI>This is not Hell! Hell I de|serve.</HI> If so, now I know that thou fearest God.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> IV. Are we in all our <HI>Tryals</HI> ve|ry studious to learn, to mind, to mend, whatever may be the <HI>procuring cause</HI> of our <HI>Tryals?</HI> Probably, when afflictions come, there is a <HI>Controversy</HI> which the God, who afflicts us, is therein managing with us. God may say to us, <HI>What have I now done? Is there not a cause?</HI> Well then, In Afflictions are we duly inquisitive after the <HI>Cause</HI> of all? When a Child was taken away from an Excellent person, she said, <HI>O man of God, sin is now brought unto Re|membrance!</HI> Accordingly when any <HI>Afflict|ion</HI> comes on us, do we set our selves to
<PB N="50" REF="001127_0055_0FB05F1AC1EFC210">
consider what <HI>Sin</HI> we can <HI>Remember</HI> as the <HI>Cause</HI> of this? Do we resolve in our Af|flictions, Lam. 3 40. <HI>Let us search and try our ways, and turn unto the Lord?</HI> In Af|flictions do we go to God, Job 10. 22. <HI>Oh shew me wherefore thou contendest with me?</HI> And, Job 34. 21. <HI>I have born Chastise|ment, I will not offend any more!</HI> Do our Afflictions cause us to set before our selves all the <HI>Commandments</HI> of God, and out of these Commandments do we search and judge, and loath our selves, according to the <HI>Cause</HI> which we may there find for our Afflictions! Are we <HI>Impartial</HI> in our finding wherein we are <HI>guilty,</HI> and then studious in our purposes, to Repent &amp; Re|form? 'Tis said of some, <HI>Their Scum re|mains:</HI> When God sets us over that <HI>Fire</HI> of Affliction, does our <HI>Scum</HI> come away or does it remain in us! Are we like the <HI>Fool in the mortar?</HI> Or are we more careful to make our <HI>Peace</HI> with God? to quicken our <HI>pace</HI> in the Race set before us? to grow more diligent in working out our own Salvation? now I know that thou fearest God.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> V. When perhaps <HI>Unaccountable Tryals</HI> do overtake us, do we cheerfully
<PB N="51" REF="001127_0056_0FB05F1D08350748">
submit unto the <HI>Will</HI> of the Soveraign <HI>God</HI> appearing in the <HI>Tryals<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> Our Gods will have his own <HI>Soveraignty</HI> stooped un|to: when we are in Afflictions, 'tis that we may own that <HI>Soveraignty.</HI> When Affliction layes us in the Dust, then do we lay our selves there, and say, <HI>We are as Dust, as Clay before the Potter? That God who may do what he will with his own?</HI> One said, <HI>I was dumb, I opened not my mouth, because thou didst it.</HI> Is this enough to stop our <HI>mouths</HI> in every affliction, <HI>It' is the doing of God, that God who does all things well, though we don't know what He does, nor why He does it?</HI> Our Lord used that <HI>Prayer, Not my will, but thy will be done!</HI> A Pattern for us. And He taught that Prayer; <HI>Let thy Will be done in Earth, as it is in Heaven.</HI> Do we say <HI>Amen</HI> unto it! Whenever any Affliction presses hard upon us, do we say with our selves, <HI>This is the will of God that it should be so; and that will is infinitely wise, and just, &amp; good, and uncontroulable, and there's infinite reasons that I should never contradict that withal!</HI> Well, what think we? do we thinks our vile <HI>will</HI> should give Law to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Will</HI> of God, that <HI>Will</HI> tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> is it self th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">

<P><HI>Quest.</HI> VI. Do none of our <HI>Tryals</HI> hin|der us from adoring the <HI>Goodness</HI> where with we are very much attended, not|withstanding our <HI>Tryals?</HI> It is a strange Folly in us, that in <HI>one Grave</HI> we com|monly bury all our <HI>Comforts.</HI> Though God has given us thousands of <HI>Comforts,</HI> yet, it we open <HI>one Grave</HI> to lay one of them there, we foolishly throw in all the rest. <HI>Oh foolish people and unwise!</HI> But instead of <HI>that,</HI> say we like the <HI>La|menting</HI> Church, Lam. 3. 27. <HI>It is of the Lords Mercies, that we are not consumed!</HI> We have many <HI>Mercies</HI> round about us, under our Afflictions? Do we see them, and own them? or, Do we make fit <HI>Comparisons</HI> of our Condition? Do we say, <HI>Though it be bad with me, it may be
<PB N="53" REF="001127_0058_0FB05F22AE32B4B8">
'tis worse with them that are better than I? Though things go bad with me, yet there are those that never Sinned as I have done, I should be loth to change with them</HI> Says <HI>Job, Shall we receive good at the hands of God, and shall we not receive evil?</HI> In our Afflictions do we think, that we re|ceive more <HI>good</HI> than <HI>evil,</HI> and we have more <HI>Delights</HI> about us than we, have <HI>Sorrows?</HI> And do we think, That we don't know when we receive <HI>Good</HI> and when <HI>Evil?</HI> Our Lord said to him of old, <HI>What I do thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter,</HI> So, <HI>It may be hereafter I may know that this is best. Jacob</HI> egregiously mistook when he said, <HI>Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, all those things are against me.</HI> Instead of saying, <HI>all these things are against me,</HI> we should say, <HI>It may be God intends them all for my good.</HI> If it be thus, now I know that thou fearest God.</P>
<P><HI>Quest.</HI> VII. In our <HI>Tryals</HI> what are our <HI>Supports,</HI> and where do we go to make up that we have lost in our <HI>Tryals?</HI> The most of men in Afflictions are like <HI>Ahaze</HI> Chr. 28, 21, 23. <HI>Ahaz goes first to the Kings of</HI> Assyria, but they help, him not, the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">

Sacrificed unto the gods of <HI>Damascus</HI> and <HI>Syria,</HI> and they were the ruine of him. So many a man when afflicted will say, <HI>I have something left still!</HI> And there is all the <HI>Refreshment</HI> he has If we are visited with Death after Death, how do we Sup|port our selves? Is it by thinking, <HI>The Lord lives, and blessed be my Rock!</HI> Like <HI>David,</HI> 2 Sam. 23. 5. <HI>Though God break my House, yet he has made with me an Everlast|ing Covenant, ordered in all thing, and sure, This is all my Salvation and all my desire, though he make it not to grow.</HI> Suppose God will not let our Houses <HI>grow,</HI> Is this the <HI>Consolation</HI> of our Soul, that God hath made a <HI>New Covenant</HI> with us? Do we comfort our selves with this, <HI>We have Christ in the New Covenant, where there is Grace and Glory, and every good Thing?</HI> Are the <HI>Promises</HI> of God our Consolation at our <HI>Funerals?</HI> can we say, <HI>I had perished in mine affliction, unless I had had the Word of God</HI> now I know that thou fearest God.</P>
<P><HI>Qu</HI> VIII. Under our <HI>Tryals,</HI> What value have we for the <HI>Spiritual &amp; Eternal Benefits</HI> that are to be gained by our <HI>Tryals?</HI> Do we say, Psal. 119 71. <HI>It is good for me that I have
<PB N="55" REF="001127_0060_0FB05F25506AF8F0">
been afflicted, that I might learn thy Statutes.</HI> This is <HI>Good,</HI> even to <HI>do justice, to love mer|cy to walk humbly with our God.</HI> 'Tis <HI>Good</HI> for us to <HI>Draw near to God.</HI> 'Tis <HI>Good</HI> for <HI>Sin</HI> to be odious, and Christ precious, and <HI>God</HI> glorious to us, and <HI>Heaven</HI> better af|fected by us than ever, and to be weaned from the <HI>world</HI> and all things below, and our <HI>Affections</HI> more set on <HI>things above:</HI> To bring <HI>forth much of that fruit whereby our Heavenly Father may be glorified.</HI> Does the Thought of getting this good by our Afflictions make them all easy to us? Do we say, <HI>It is better for me that I should be partaker of this Good, than to have my Riches and Children all about me! and a Soul pining away in Iniquity, or leanness in my Soul? It is better for me to have the Grace of God, then all the good things of this world about me.</HI> If it be thus, now I know that thou fearest God.</P>
<P>Well then, For the Conclusion of all; Oh Let not the <HI>Consolation of God be small</HI> unto you that have attained and practised this right behaviour. If under your afflictive Tryals you behave your selves agreeably to the Expectation of God, what follows but this, I know
<PB N="56" REF="001127_0061_0FB05F26C63AA290">
that thou fearest God? Suppose God should Commission one of His Angels to Speak that unto us, as to <HI>Abraham, Now I know thou Fearest God;</HI> would not that abun|dantly make amends for all that we have undergone, under our Tryals?</P>
<P>Oh! Should the blessed God Say to us, <HI>Now I know, that thou fearest me,</HI> what could we feel after this, either of the <HI>In|chantments</HI> or the <HI>Distresses</HI> of this World? Let me speak the word of the <HI>Angel</HI> to those that sincerely thus endeavour; <HI>Now I know that thou fearest God;</HI> and tell you up|on it, <HI>Now I know that there is a great Good|ness laid up for thee.</HI> Tis said, Psal 31. 19. <HI>Oh how great is thy goodness which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee.</HI> Yea, shall we take it home to our selves; <HI>Now we know that we fear God:</HI> but what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> do we <HI>know? Now we know,</HI> we should be of <HI>Good cheer,</HI> because <HI>our Sins are forgiven</HI> us, as to them that <HI>fear Him. Now we know,</HI> that <HI>God</HI> is our <HI>Portion, Christ</HI> our <HI>Saviour, Heaven our inheritance; Death is ours;</HI> it shall do us no <HI>harm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t. Now we know, that all things shall work together for good unto us.</HI> God will give us <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Glory,</HI> and all the <HI>sure Mercies</HI> of his <HI>Covenant;</HI> God will
<PB N="57" REF="001127_0062_0FB05F28CD6945F8">
keep <HI>us in Integrity,</HI> and <HI>Set us before his face for ever; Now we know,</HI> that the <HI>Lines are fallen to us in pleasant places,</HI> that God will shew us the <HI>p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">th of Life,</HI> and bring us to the <HI>fullness of joy and pleasures at his Right hand forever more</HI> And <HI>knowing</HI> this, we may <HI>know,</HI> that we are Welcome to the <HI>Table</HI> of the Lord.

<P>But how can I dismiss you, O my Hear|ers, without an <HI>Exhortation,</HI> To make tho|row work in a <HI>Self Examination</HI> upon that Important point, <HI>Whether we have the Fear of God, or no?</HI> Christians, That famous Exercise of Christianity, even, Self Exa|mination, is to be now press'd upon you, <HI>in the fear of God;</HI> and, a Self Exami|nation, whether you have it?

even, Self Examination, our <HI>Com|ing together</HI> will be to good purpose.

<P>Secondly; There is Enjoy'd in <HI>Hea|ven,</HI> a State of Uninterrupted but Inex|pressible Fellowship <HI>with God, thro' our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> Would we be told, how 'tis in <HI>Heaven?</HI> The <HI>Old Testament</HI> has told us, (Psal. 17. 15.) We shall there <HI>Behold the Face of God in Righte|ousness, and be Satisfied with His Likeness.</HI> The <HI>New Testament</HI> has told us. (1 Joh. 3. 2) We shall there <HI>Be like the Lord Jesus Christ&punc; for we shall see Him as He is.</HI> This, This is <HI>Heaven!</HI> The Scripture that leads us thither, has given us this Account of it. Let is gaze a little up|on the several <HI>Stars</HI> that Glitter in this our Scriptural Account of it.</P>
<P>First, In <HI>Heaven</HI> there is granted a very Immediate <HI>Sight</HI> of our Lord JESUS CHRIST. God in His Everlasting <HI>De|cree,</HI> that a <HI>Man</HI> should be personally, Uni|ted
<PB N="80" REF="001127_0085_0FB064C19D3DD318">
unto His own Second Person forever, did also Decree, that certain <HI>other men</HI> should be given unto this most Glorious <HI>Man,</HI> to be with Hi <HI>Angels,</HI> the Spectators and partakers of His <HI>Glory.</HI> Our Lord JESUS CHRIST now mentions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, as the main point of <HI>Heaven;</HI> Joh.17. 24. <HI>Father, I will, that they whom thou hast gi|ven me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my Glory, which thou hast given me.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>Heaven</HI> then, they <HI>see</HI> that Man, who is <HI>God</HI> as well as <HI>man,</HI> and <HI>in whom there dwells the Fulness of the Godhead Bodily</HI> a They <HI>see</HI> that <HI>Man,</HI> who once appeared in the <HI>Form of a Servant,</HI> but now is <HI>Highly Exalted with a Name about every Name:</HI> They <HI>see</HI> that <HI>Man,</HI> who Sits <HI>down at the Right Hand of the Majesty on High, Sway|ing</HI> the <HI>Scepter</HI> of the Universe. They <HI>see</HI> Him, with Eternal Transport! And as it is in the Enjoying of the <HI>Light,</HI> the Enjoyment that one man has of it, hin|ders not, abates not the Enjoyment of a|nother; So in this <HI>Inheritance of the Saints in Light,</HI> the Sight of the <HI>altogether Lovely</HI> Lord JESUS CHRIST Enjoy'd by one Saint, is no Hindrance to the <HI>Sight</HI> which
<PB N="81" REF="001127_0086_0FB064C3A5139B90">
another <HI>Saint</HI> has of Him, or to his <HI>Joy</HI> in the <HI>Sight.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, In and by the <HI>Sight</HI> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, in <HI>Heaven,</HI> the Al|mighty GOD communicates of HIM|SELF unto His Chosen, with never-ending <HI>Satisfaction.</HI></P>
<P>The Lord JESUS CHRIST is the <HI>Sun</HI> of that <HI>Heaven,</HI> which we are hoping for; It is said of Him, Mal.4 2. He is the <HI>Sun of Righteousness, that has Healing in His Wings.</HI> Now all <HI>Heaven</HI> is Irradiated with that <HI>Sun of Righteousness.</HI> The Rayes of that <HI>Sun</HI> are darted all over the Vast Hea|venly Realms of Bliss, and all the Saints of Heaven, do greedily take in those <HI>Rayes,</HI> with <HI>Joy unspeakable and full of glory.</HI> The Name of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, in the Oracles of the Sacred Scripture, is, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Face of God:</HI> and in that one Hint, you have a Golden <HI>key,</HI> to open a thousand passage, in these Oracles. When we come near to our Lord JESUS CHRIST in <HI>Heaven,</HI> we shall in Him see the <HI>Face of God;</HI> and see the <HI>Face of God</HI> shining with a Lustre infinitely beyond that on the <HI>Face of Moses:</HI> the <HI>Face of Moses</HI> coming down from the Mount, was a dark Thing in com|parison
<PB N="82" REF="001127_0087_0FB064C554CB8838">
of it. Hence we read, 2 Cor. 4 6 <HI>There is Glory of God, in the Face of Jesus Christ.</HI> No <HI>mortal</HI> Eye were able to behold a Sight so full of Majesty: The Disciple who lay next Him at His Table while He was on Earth, after He was gone to Heaven Swoon'd away at the sight of Him: <HI>His Countenance was as the Sum shining is his meridian.</HI> But is this all? N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; In <HI>Heaven,</HI> they also Hear the <HI>Voice</HI> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST; and no <HI>Thunder</HI> so great, no Musick so sweet, as that <HI>Voice:</HI> it is the <HI>Voice of the Lord God Almighty:</HI> When that <HI>Voice</HI> is uttered, all <HI>Heaven</HI> shakes with Glad Astonishments! It carries <HI>Life</HI> with it, wherever it reaches. It follows, that in <HI>Heaven,</HI> they are all filled with the <HI>Grace</HI> of the Lord JESUS CHRIT, and He there withal <HI>Showes them all things:</HI> He leads them Successively from one <HI>Fountain of Life</HI> unto another. All that a Reasona|ble Soul, can Reasonably wish to know of the Ever blessed God, the Lord JESUS CHRIST blesses them in <HI>Heaven,</HI> with the knowledge of it. The <HI>Perfections</HI> of GOD, are more Exemplified, and more Illustrated in the Lord JESUS CHRIST, than in all His Works of the whole <HI>Creation</HI> beside,
<PB N="83" REF="001127_0088_0FB064C746757CF8">
which has all received its <HI>Beginning</HI> from Him. He is the <HI>Express Image</HI> thereof; &amp; all the works of God, meet in Him, with a most Exquisite and Curious <HI>Recapitulation</HI> of them. Now in <HI>Heaven,</HI> they take a view of this <HI>Image,</HI> with Everlasting De|light: and, <HI>Lord In thy Light,</HI> thy CHRIST, <HI>we shall see Light!</HI> But while they do thus, their Happiness may be Express'd in those Terms; 2 Cor. 3 18 <HI>Beholding, the Glory of the Lord, we are changed into the same I|mage from Glory to Glory, as by the spirit of the Lord.</HI> The <HI>Understandings</HI> of the Glo|rified, will be mightily Enlarged and En|lightned.

The <HI>Spirit</HI> of our Lord JESUS CHRIST, hath a marvellous <HI>possession</HI> of them that are in <HI>Heaven.</HI> He makes them as like unto the Lord JESUS CHRIST, as it is possible.

make them Resemble Him, Exceedingly, O all that are in <HI>Heaven,</HI> it may be said, <HI>Lord, As thou art, so are they, each one Re|sembling the Children of the Eternal King!</HI> It is said, Rom 8. 29. <HI>God hath predistinat|ed us, to be conformed unto the Image of His Son.</HI> In Heaven <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> brought about! And there, He is perpetually, with an Eternal Variety&punc; giving them admirable Testimo|nies of His Good Will to them; and they, both Receive these Testimonies with Rap|tures of Joy, and Return Testimonies of their own Holy Dedication to Him.

This is the Heavenly State&punc;</HI></P>
<P>Secondly; But is there not an <HI>Heavenly Place,</HI> wherein they are to be made parta|kers of this <HI>Heavenly State?</HI> Yea, such a <HI>Place</HI> there is. We read, 2 Cor 5. 1. <HI>We have an House not made with Hands, Eternal in the Heavens.</HI> If there be an <HI>House for us in Heaven,</HI> there must needs be a <HI>Place</HI> for us. There are to be <HI>Bodies</HI> in <HI>Heaven;</HI> Yea, many <HI>Bodies</HI> are already there. But <HI>Bodies</HI> require <HI>Place.</HI> It is non-sense to say, That <HI>Heaven</HI> is a <HI>State,</HI> without a <HI>Place.</HI>
<PB N="85" REF="001127_0090_0FB064C9D15E0B80">
But then, Where is the <HI>Place?</HI> I shall at present, say only two or three things con|cerning it.</P>
<P>First; The <HI>Place</HI> of <HI>Heaven,</HI> is, where our Lord JESUS CHRIST resides, in His Glorious <HI>Manhood, Ah, Lord, Thou wilt make Heaven, wherever thou comest!</HI> It is the periphrasis of <HI>Heaven,</HI> Joh 12. 26 <HI>Where I am&punc; there shall my Servant be;</HI> That is to say, He shall be <HI>in Heaven.</HI> Our Lord JESUS CHRIST is the very <HI>Heaven</HI> of <HI>Hea|ven</HI> it self. Let the <HI>Sun</HI> be on what side of the Globe it will, it will be <HI>Day</HI> there. And it will be <HI>Heaven,</HI> Wherever our Exal|ted JESUS comes. It is the Lord JESUS CHRIST, that is the <HI>Tree of Life,</HI> in the <HI>midst of that paradise;</HI> as the famous Tree so called at the Beginning, was, in the midst of the <HI>Innocent stand of Eden:</HI> And indeed, wherever <HI>He</HI> is, His being there, is enough to make <HI>Paradise.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly; Those bright Regions, that are the <HI>Place</HI> of <HI>Heaven,</HI> are the very <HI>best Rooms</HI> of the whose Creation, though the <HI>Upper Stories</HI> of is. <HI>Heaven</HI> for this cause is called, <HI>The Throne of God.</HI> We read, Psal. 11 4. <HI>The Lords Throne is in Heaven.</HI> Certainly, <HI>The Throne of God</HI> must be the
<PB N="86" REF="001127_0091_0FB064CB5D921D38">
most Glorious Place that can be! Of <HI>Ca|naan</HI> it is said, <HI>It was the Glory of all Lands,</HI> Much more, may it be said of <HI>Heaven.</HI> Yea, Tis the <HI>Heaven of Heavens,</HI> where our Lord JESUS CHRIST fits upon His Throne that is. The most Excellent <HI>Heaven</HI> of all Indeed, the <HI>Heaven</HI> of the Blessed, contains vast <HI>Regions</HI> in it: <HI>There are many Mansions,</HI> yea, there are <HI>many Regions,</HI> in the <HI>Heavenly Country.</HI> The <HI>Earth,</HI> although it be above one and twenty Thousand Miles in Cir|cumference, is but a small Point, if com|pared unto <HI>Heaven;</HI> perhaps t'would be In|visible to one Station'd there.</P>
<P>Thirdly; The Chosen of God shall en|joy their <HI>Heaven,</HI> in <HI>more than One Indivi|dual Place.</HI> For, there will a Time come, when our <HI>Heaven</HI> shall be within our <HI>At|mosphere,</HI> in the Higher parts of this <HI>Air,</HI> and nor many miles from this <HI>Earth,</HI> for at least, a <HI>Thousand years</HI> together. It will be thus, during the <HI>Day of Judgment;</HI> yea, if that <HI>Thousand years,</HI> (which <HI>according to the promise, we look for!)</HI> make but the <HI>Morning</HI> to the <HI>Day of Judgment,</HI> we can|not say, How long we may see <HI>Heaven</HI> con|tinue within this our <HI>Atmosphere.</HI> Tis said, 2 Pet. 3. 13. <HI>We look for New Heavens.</HI>
<PB N="87" REF="001127_0092_0FB064CE7301C8F8">
as well as <HI>New Earth;</HI> which will evi|dently be after the Descent of our Lord. Our Lord JESUS CHRIST, will then with His <HI>Holy Myriads,</HI> dispossess the <HI>Devils</HI> of the <HI>high places,</HI> which are at present occu|pied by the <HI>power of the Air.</HI> These <HI>high places</HI> will then be possessed by our Lord Jesus Christ, having the <HI>City of God come down</HI> thither with Him, where the Saints then Living will all be <HI>caught up to meet Him Heaven</HI> will then be <HI>there,</HI> dispensing of <HI>Heavenly Influences,</HI> to the <HI>New World,</HI> until the Lord JESUS CHRIST shall carry His <HI>Armies</HI> away from thence, Him|self marching in the Head of them&punc; unto His other <HI>Heavens.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Second</HI> Enquiry is;</P>
<P><HI>Who are the</HI> HEAVENLY SPIRITS, <HI>that go away to this Heaven?</HI></P>
<P>Tis to be thus Answered</P>
<P>First, The ANGELS of the Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>Revisit Heaven.</HI> when they have dispatched the <HI>particular Services</HI> which they have to do for Him on <HI>Earth.</HI> The <HI>Angels</HI> are the <HI>Natives</HI> of <HI>Heaven;</HI> those <HI>Morning Stars</HI> have <HI>their own Habitation</HI> there; those <HI>Sons of God</HI> are Lodg'd in that their <HI>Fathers House.</HI> Where the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI>

of our Lord JESUS CHRIST is, there His <HI>Angels</HI> are; <HI>Thousands of Thousands do Minister unto Him, Ten Thousand times Ten Thousand stand before Him.</HI> Those <HI>Angels</HI> are the Princes of the Caelestial Court; who in all their bright Order Encompass the Throne of the Lord Jesus Christ, and pay their humblest&punc; Homage unto Him. We read, Psal 103 19. 20. <HI>The Lord hath, prepared His Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">one in the Heavens;</HI> And it follows, <HI>O ye Angles, mighty in Strength, you do His Commandments, hearkening unto the voice of His Word.</HI> Those <HI>Heavenly Spi|rits</HI> do come down from <HI>Heaven;</HI> even from our Lord JESUS CHRIST in <HI>Hea|ven;</HI> when H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Affairs upon <HI>Earth</HI> to Employ them in As, when a <HI>Message</HI> was to be dispatch'd from <HI>Heaven,</HI> unto <HI>Daniel,</HI> that Lovely man of God: We read, Dan 9 21 The <HI>Angel Gabriel</HI> must fly <HI>Swift's</HI> down unto him&punc; And when those Attain and Errands are done, these <HI>Heavenly Spirits</HI> return to their former Stations, where they <HI>alwayes b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ll the Face of God in Heaven.</HI> Thus, we read, Z<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ch, 1 11 The <HI>Angels</HI> appear before God, with this Account, <HI>We have walked to and fro thro' the Earth, and behold</HI> Things are

so and so: They make Report, how they have discharged the Duty, they were sent upon</P>
<P>Secondly; The SOULS of the Faith|ful among the Children of men, having <HI>Finished the Work,</HI> which the Lord Jesus Christ has ordered them to do on <HI>Earth,</HI> do then also <HI>Ascend into Heaven.</HI> There are some among the Children of men, whom the powerful Spirit of God hath overcome, to <HI>Believe</HI> on the Influences of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, for their safe Arrival to <HI>Heaven</HI> at the last. Those that have thus given themselves unto the Lord JESUS CHRIST, in <HI>Believing</HI> on Him, have a <HI>Work</HI> to do, in gratitude unto their Lord Redeemer, before they come to <HI>Heaven.</HI> Such <HI>Believers</HI> are by the <HI>Sanctifying Grace</HI> of the Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>male meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in Light.</HI> And when these Holy Believers Dy, the <HI>Angels</HI> of the Lord carry and convoy a|way their <HI>Spirits</HI> to be with Him in <HI>Hea|ven:</HI> They are no sooner <HI>Departed</HI> but, Phil. 1 23 <HI>They are with Christ, where to be is by far the best of all</HI> There were mil|lions of <HI>Angels,</HI> that upon a Rebellion a|gainst God, were Banished from Heaven.</P>

of it. And the Express word of the Lord JESUS CHRIST assures us, <HI>There is no Killing of the Soul.</HI> [See also, Luk. 16. 9. &amp; Rom 8 10. The <HI>Consent of Souls</HI> in all sensible Nations, unto the <HI>Immortality of the Soul,</HI> is nothing else, but an Impression which the Maker of the <HI>Soul</HI> has made upon it; and it is infallible. And the <HI>presage</HI> which the <HI>Spirits</HI> of men often have of their lea|ving their <HI>Bodies,</HI> at such or such a Time, very punctually &amp; marvellously accomplished, plainly argues, that they out live the <HI>Bodies.</HI> Now, the <HI>Work</HI> of <HI>Grace</HI> upon a Godly <HI>Soul,</HI> bespeaks an <HI>Heavenly World</HI> for such a <HI>Soul,</HI> at its Departure. The <HI>Grace</HI> wrought in a Godly Soul, shall never Dy; No, It abides for ever. But if the <HI>Soul</HI> Dy, the Work of <HI>Grace</HI> upon it, would also Dy.

good Works,</HI> He will not throw by this <HI>Workmanship,</HI> into the useless Rubbish of <HI>Non Entity,</HI> we may be sure of it.

What Advice hast thou to give us, concerning the <HI>Night</HI> that is now come upon us? What is our Condition in this <HI>Night</HI> of our Calamity? The People of God, tho'

Watchman, What of the Night?</HI> What have you to tell us, about the <HI>Night</HI> which we so often fall into? Truly, Syrs, I am to tell you, That our <HI>Night</HI> is not so <HI>Dark</HI> and <HI>Sad,</HI> as it seems to be. There are sweet Songs of Satisfaction and Consolations, which <HI>God our Maker</HI> has provided for us. Be the <HI>Night</HI> never so <HI>Black,</HI> we are not un|furnished with Songs of Satisfaction and Consolation, for to sweeten it.</P>
<P>We are advised of them, in the words of <HI>Elihu.</HI> That Holy Young man takes Notice, of people <HI>Crying</HI> in Affliction, and yet not <HI>Saved</HI> from Affliction. And he gives the Reason, Why the Great God, will not Remove <HI>Affliction,</HI> from some that are mourning and groaning under it. The Reason is, Because their <HI>Affliction</HI> do's not bring them to <HI>Repentance;</HI> And that <HI>Repentance</HI> is thus described, <HI>None saith, Where is God my Maker?</HI> q. d. They don't Remember, <HI>Who made</HI> them, and <HI>why</HI> He <HI>made</HI> them, nor consider the <HI>Errand</HI> which He that <HI>made</HI> them, sent them into the

World upon; and they don't Return to their <HI>Maker</HI> from those wayes of Sin, for which they feel Him chastising of them.</P>
<P>There now follows a Clause, that con|tains in it, a mighty Encouragement unto <HI>Repentance</HI> under <HI>Affliction;</HI> He <HI>giveth Songs in the Night.</HI> By the <HI>Night</HI> seems to be meant, A Time of <HI>Affliction:</HI> And by, <HI>the Songs</HI> given in this <HI>Night,</HI> seem to be meant, Matters of <HI>Satisfaction</HI> and <HI>Consola|tion,</HI> which God has provided. But for whom are they provided? Even for those that under <HI>Affliction,</HI> say, <HI>Where is God my Maker?</HI> i. e. That Seek Him, and Serve Him, as their <HI>Maker,</HI> and seriously <HI>Repent</HI> of all their Wandrings from Him, where|in men forget the <HI>Law of their Creation.</HI> In the Original 'tis, <HI>My Makers;</HI> A Nota|ble Intimation of the <HI>Trinity</HI> in God E|<HI>very Person</HI> in the Ever Adorable <HI>Trinity,</HI> concurr'd in the <HI>Making</HI> of man; and man owes Acknowledgments unto <HI>Every Person in the Trinity;</HI> yea, we do not Ac|knowledge our <HI>Maker,</HI> if the <HI>Father,</HI> the <HI>Son,</HI> and the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> receives not an Homage from us.</P>

It was of old said, <HI>if He give Quietness, who can make Trouble?</HI> If there be any <HI>Trouble</HI> upon us, it could not have come without His Direction. Take it for a Time of <HI>Affliction,</HI> as well as more Lite|rally, and still we must say, Psal. 74 16.

bring many a <HI>Night</HI> of <HI>Affliction</HI> upon His <HI>Own Children,</HI> even upon His <HI>Dearest Children.</HI> There is a <HI>Vicissitude</HI> of <HI>Day</HI> and <HI>Night</HI> Experienced by the People of God; and God; in His Dispensations towards His people, hath <HI>Set the one over against the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> The <HI>Experience</HI> of all the Faithful, will be a full <HI>Evidence</HI> to This; That we must have many a <HI>Night of Affliction</HI> rol|ling over us. Yea, Heb. 12 7, 8 <HI>If ye Endure Chastening, God dealeth with you as with Sons; But if ye be without Chastise|ment, then are ye Bastards and not Sons.

amazing Thing! The <HI>Sun of Righteousness.</HI> Himself was covered with <HI>Darkness!</HI> An horrid <HI>Night</HI> came upon Him, who is Him|self, <HI>The Light.</HI> He that is the <HI>Day star,</HI> and who makes <HI>Day</HI> wherever He comes, yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">elt, Luk. 22. 53. <HI>The Power of Darkness.</HI></P>
<P>We may now Enquire.</P>
<P>First, What <HI>Affliction</HI> it is, that may make a <HI>Night</HI> unto the Children of God?</P>
<P>Now, tis plain; That the <HI>Withdraw</HI> of our <HI>Comfortable Enjoyments,</HI> is Enough to make a <HI>Night</HI> for us. When God brings upon us any Lamentable Bereavements of our <HI>Comfortable Enjoyments,</HI> we may say; Lam 3 6 <HI>He hath set me in dark places.</HI> It was a <HI>Night</HI> with <HI>Jacob,</HI> it was a <HI>Night</HI> with <HI>Ephraim,</HI> it was a <HI>Night</HI> with <HI>David,</HI> when his <HI>Children</HI> were taken from him, and it was a <HI>Night</HI> with <HI>Job,</HI> when his <HI>Riches</HI> as well as his <HI>Children</HI> were taken from him, and <HI>Sickness</HI> within, and <HI>Censure</HI> abroad, was also hard upon him.</P>
<P>Yea, but it adds unto the Circumstances of the <HI>Night</HI> with us, when we are utterly <HI>at a Loss,</HI> which way to take, what course to steer; when we <HI>Grope as in the Dark,</HI> to find the methods of our Safety. Tis a <HI>Night</HI> with us, when we are <HI>in the Dark,</HI>
<PB N="116" REF="001127_0121_0FB06787EDA17908">
and <HI>at a Loss,</HI> what we shall do, that we may not <HI>Stumble into Mischief.</HI> How full of <HI>Night,</HI> is that <HI>Affliction,</HI> wherein a man must say, Job 19. 8. <HI>He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and He hath set Dark|ness in my pathes!</HI></P>
<P>And the <HI>Night</HI> is yet more <HI>Night some</HI> unto us, when we are Surrounded and As|saulted with cruel <HI>Enemies,</HI> on every side of us. We read, Psal. 104 20, 21. <HI>Thou mak|est Darkness, and it is Night, wherein all the Beasts of the Forest do creep forth; The young Lions roar after their Prey.</HI> It is a <HI>Night</HI> In|deed, when God lets loose <HI>Wild Beasts</HI> upon us, to Worry us, with fur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ous and raging Persecutions. It was a <HI>Night</HI> of <HI>Egyptian Darkness,</HI> when <HI>Evil Spirits</HI> were let loose, to molest and affright the Objects of their <HI>Indignation.</HI> What is it, when men mani|festly filled with, and acted by <HI>Evil Spirits,</HI> are let loose to buffet us, with all the Effects of a most Venemous Malice against us?</P>
<P>But, finally, That which will make our <HI>Night,</HI> as <HI>Dark</HI> as the <HI>Shadow of Death</HI> it self, will be, If God withdraw the <HI>Light of His Countenance</HI> from us, and withold from us the Influences of His <HI>Grace,</HI> which are need|ful to Support and Quicken us. <HI>God is
<PB N="117" REF="001127_0122_0FB0678950DAF100">
Light;</HI> and the Gracious Presence of <HI>God,</HI> would make <HI>Day</HI> for His People at <HI>Mid|night.</HI> But if <HI>God hide his Face,</HI> then, then Indeed we have a dismal <HI>Night</HI> of it. We then truly, <HI>Walk in Darkness, and see no Light.</HI> Our Groans may then, if ever, be those; Psal. 88. 6. 7. Lord, <HI>Thou hast laid me in Darkness; Thy wrath lieth hard upon me.</HI></P>
<P>We may Enquire,</P>
<P>Next; Why the Holy God, will bring <HI>Night of Affliction</HI> upon any of His Chil|dren?</P>
<P>In one Word; It is to give us Oppor|tunity for our <HI>Songs in the Night.</HI> God will <HI>Glorify</HI> Himself, in and by, every <HI>Night of Affliction</HI> that He sends upon us. And God is never more <HI>Glorified,</HI> than by have|ing the <HI>Graces</HI> of His Children Exercised in their Affliction. But the <HI>Graces</HI> of good men are Exercised, in their <HI>Singing the Songs</HI> that God has given them. This therefore brings us to a further Entertainment.</P>
<P N="2">II There are glorious Matters of <HI>Satis|faction</HI> and <HI>Consolation,</HI> which the Children of God are to make their Songs in the <HI>Night</HI> of their <HI>Affliction.</HI> There are the <HI>Songs of Zion,</HI> which are prepared by God
<PB N="118" REF="001127_0123_0FB0678C964AFC48">
for the <HI>Sons of Zion;</HI> and some of them are peculiarly calculated for the <HI>Night.</HI> As it was said, Psal. 119. 54. <HI>Thy Statutes have been my Songs, in the House of my Pil|grimage:</HI> Thus, the <HI>Statutes</HI> of God in|form us, of matters for our <HI>Songs,</HI> in the <HI>Night of our Affliction. Davids</HI> Harp never founded better than in the <HI>Night</HI> and upon the <HI>Water.</HI> More particularly.</P>
<P>First, It is a Song to be Sung in the <HI>Night</HI> of our Affliction, <HI>That the Great God is the First Cause of our Affliction.</HI> This was the <HI>Song</HI> of that Excellent man, Job 5. 6. 8. <HI>Affliction cometh not forth of the Dust, neither doth Trouble spring out of the Ground: I would seek unto God,</HI> when it comes. Who is it that sends upon us all our <HI>Darkness?</HI> Tis that God, of whom we have that <HI>Song,</HI> Amos 4. 13. <HI>Lo, Tis He that makes the morning Darkness, the LORD, the God of Hosts is His Name.</HI> We are too prone, in the <HI>Night</HI> of our Affliction, to look upon <HI>Second Causes;</HI> and especially if Rational and In|jurious <HI>Instruments</HI> have been concerned in our <HI>Affliction.</HI> But it will be a very <HI>dark Night</HI> indeed with us, if we can't see be|yond <HI>Second Causes.</HI> Oh, Let us look thro' all the <HI>Darkness,</HI> unto the Great GOD, as
<PB N="119" REF="001127_0124_0FB0678EE91FF440">
the <HI>First Cause</HI> of all; And let this be our <HI>Song</HI> in the <HI>Night: Though Clouds and Dark|ness be round about Him, yet Righteousness &amp; Judgment are the Habitation of His Throne.</HI> Though <HI>Instruments</HI> be very deeply con|cerned in our Affliction, yet the <HI>Song</HI> of a <HI>Job</HI> will be, <HI>The Lord has taken away!</HI> the <HI>Song</HI> of a <HI>David</HI> will be, <HI>The Lord has bid|den them!</HI> It is an admirably well tuned <HI>Song,</HI> that we find with the <HI>Sweet singer of Israel:</HI> Psal. 39. 9. Lord, <HI>I was Dumb, I opened not my mouth, because thou didst it.</HI></P>
<P>But now, this is a <HI>Song,</HI> which has con|siderable matters of Satisfaction in it. There are many <HI>parts</HI> of the <HI>Song.</HI> We are with particular Descants to <HI>Sing</HI> upon the several <HI>Glories</HI> of our <HI>Maker;</HI> the <HI>maker</HI> who has <HI>given us our Songs!</HI></P>
<P>The Sovereignty of God, must be our <HI>Song in the Night.</HI> This was the <HI>Song,</HI> of one who had his lovely Children taken away from him; Job 9. 12. <HI>Behold, He taketh away; who can hinder Him? Who will say unto Him, what doest thou?</HI> We strangely Multiply and Aggravate our <HI>Griefs,</HI> while we resolve to call Things, <HI>Our own.</HI> Tis to make them our <HI>Idols;</HI> &amp; <HI>Idols</HI> will be <HI>Griefs.</HI> In the <HI>Night,</HI> let us
<PB N="120" REF="001127_0125_0FB0679000D8B490">
come to See and <HI>Sing,</HI> Who is the Abso|lute, Unlimited, Uncontrourable <HI>Owner</HI> of us, and all that we have. Our <HI>Song</HI> most be This: <Q>I am absolutely at the Dispose of the Soveraign God! I and mine are in His Hands, as Clay before the Porter: Oh! Let not me, a sorry Potsherd of the Earth, strive with my Maker, the God of Heaven. Let my Will submit, and be for ever melted and moulded into the Will of God: O my Soul, Be thou in Subjection unto the Father of Spirits, and Live!</Q></P>
<P>Again; The Righteousness of God, must be our <HI>Song in the Night.</HI> This was the <HI>Song</HI> of an afflicted Prophet, Dan. 9. 14. <HI>The Lord hath brought the Evil upon us; the Lord our God is Righteous in all the works which He doeth; for we have not obey'd His voice.</HI> If a <HI>Pharaoh</HI> in his <HI>Night,</HI> could say, <HI>The Lord is Righteous, and I am Wicked;</HI> much more will a Christian, who is less <HI>Wicked,</HI> say so. We should come to be of a Thoughtful Temper, when God is Cha|stising of us, and think, <HI>He does it not for nothing!</HI> Our <HI>Song</HI> should now be of this Tenour; <HI>Since the most Righteous One is Laying His Hand upon me, Oh, Let me Search
<PB N="121" REF="001127_0126_0FB06792B816E300">
and Try my wayes and Humble my self be|fore Him and obtain the pardon of my Sins, and Reform all that is amiss! And why should I now complain for the punishment of my Sins? Lord, my wayes are not equal, but thy wayes are always equal.</HI></P>
<P>Once more; The Power of God, must be our <HI>Song in the Night.</HI> This was the <HI>Song</HI> of that Great Saint in his Affliction; Job 42. 2. <HI>I know, that thou canst do every thing.</HI> What can better be Realized in the <HI>Night,</HI> than the <HI>Power</HI> of that Almighty Creator, who first of all <HI>divided the Light from the Darkness, and called the Darkness Night.</HI> He that could Raise a <HI>Job</HI> from a Dunghil; He that could Raise an <HI>Hezekiah</HI> from a Sick-bed; He that could give unto an <HI>Amaziah,</HI> much <HI>more than all that he Lost;</HI> What can't He do for us, in the <HI>Night</HI> that is come upon us? Our <HI>Song</HI> should now be of this Purport, <Q>That Powerful God, who hath caused my Sun to go down at Noon, can cause it also to Rise at midnight with me. My God can make me glad, accord|ing to the Dayes wherein He hath afflicted me, and the Years wherein
<PB N="122" REF="001127_0127_0FB06793BB421EC8">
I have seen Evil. Be my Case never so Dark, the Lord my God can En|lighten my Darkness. Be my Case ne|ver so Hard, there is nothing too Hard for the Lord. Be I brought never so Low, the Lord that Raises the Dead, can Raise me up.</Q></P>
<P>Once more; the wisdom of God, must be our <HI>Song in the Night.</HI> You may hear that <HI>Song</HI> in the mouth of the affli|cted Saint; Psal. 119 75. <HI>I know, O Lord, that thy Judgments are Right, and that thou in Faithfulness hast afflicted me.</HI> In the <HI>Night,</HI> we are in the <HI>Dark,</HI> about the <HI>Na|ture,</HI> and the <HI>Design,</HI> and the <HI>Issue</HI> of our Troubles. But the <HI>Wisdom of God</HI> sees all things in a <HI>True Light.</HI> It is <HI>Wisely</HI> con|trived, that in the Division of <HI>Time,</HI> there should be <HI>Night</HI> as well as <HI>Day.</HI> How cheerfully may we refer and resign every thing, to that God, whose <HI>Understanding is Infinite!</HI> Our <HI>Song</HI> then should run much upon such <HI>Notes</HI> as these; <Q>The All wise God sees, that some Night, and not all Day, is best for me. O Lord, how manifold are thy works, in thy Dealings with me? In wisdom hast thou done them all. Thou knowest,
<PB N="123" REF="001127_0128_0FB0679764E269D0">
when I want Affliction, and what Af|fliction is fittest for me. Thou know|est, When, and How to deliver me out of my Affliction. And thou knowest, How and Where to make my Afflicti|on profitable.</Q></P>
<P>Furthermore; The Merry of God should be our <HI>Song in the Night.</HI> You may hear that <HI>Song,</HI> in the mouth of the Afflicted Church; Lam 3. 22. <HI>It is of the Lords mercies that we are not consumed; be|cause His Compassions fail not.</HI> In the <HI>Night</HI> we are easily Terrified. How apt are we to take up Terrible Apprehensions, when the <HI>Night</HI> comes upon us: <HI>Has the Lord forgotten to be gracious? Is His Mercy clean gone? Hath He shut up His Tender Mercies in Anger?</HI> But let us not make <HI>rash conclu|sions</HI> from our <HI>Sharp Corrections.</HI> Our <HI>Song</HI> should be of such a strain as this; <Q>The merciful God punishes me far less than my Iniquities have deserved; and tho' He bereave me of some Comforts, yet He leaves me still a thousand more Comforts than Sorrows. Nor does my Affliction by God, argue my Rejection from God: No, my Affliction ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> be rather an Argument for my Adoptione:
<PB N="124" REF="001127_0129_0FB0679B1FF27780">
For whom the <HI>Lord</HI> Loveth, He Chasten|eth, and Scou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">geth every Son Whom He receiveth. At the last, I shall find, That God is Good in Afflicting of me, and that it is Good for me to be Af|flicted.</Q></P>
<P>Finally; The fullness of God should be our <HI>Song in the Night.</HI> It was the <HI>Song</HI> of the Prophet; Hab. 3. 18. <HI>Though the Fields shall yield no meat, yet I will Rejoyce in the Lord, I will Joy in the God of my Sal|vation.</HI> When every thing else has left us, and by leaving us, hath made a <HI>Night</HI> un|to us, <HI>Now</HI> 'tis a Time for us to Sing, <HI>The Lord is my Light,</HI> The <HI>Alsufficiency</HI> of God, should be the Retreat, and the Re|lief of our Souls, in the <HI>Night;</HI> when we Lose the Sight of all Creatures &amp; can see nothing of them except their <HI>Insufficiency.</HI> Now strike up for such a <HI>Song</HI> as this; <Q>I know, that my Redeemer Lives; What tho' I see a Death upon all Sub|lunary Enjoyments? The Lord is my Portion, saith my Soul, and I will hope in Him, when all other things do fail me. While I have God and Christ for my Portion, I have a Goodly Heritage. Whatever be taken away from me. Here,
<PB N="125" REF="001127_0130_0FB0679C0E526D78">
Here I have a Good part that cannot be taken away! Why should I be so troubled for the breaking and spilling of my little Earthen Cups! I have a Living Fountain still to repair unto.</Q></P>
<P>But then, Secondly; It is a Song to be Sung in the <HI>Night</HI> of our Affliction; <HI>That no little Good will be the Effect of our Affliction.</HI> This was the <HI>Song</HI> of that Ex|cellent man; Psal. 119 71. <HI>Tis Good for me that I should be Afflicted.</HI> When we are in the <HI>Night</HI> of our Affliction, we are much in the <HI>Dark</HI> oftentimes about the meaning of it. But let no Darkness hin|der us from that <HI>Construction</HI> of all Affli|ction; Gen 50. 20. <HI>God has meant it unto Good.</HI></P>
<P>Our Lord JESUS CHRIST has brought us into a <HI>New Covenant:</HI> The <HI>New Cove|nant</HI> hath in it <HI>very great and precious Pro|mises.</HI> These <HI>Promises</HI> are to be our <HI>Songs in the Night.</HI> Is it not <HI>promised? The Lord will not suffer us to be Tempted above what we are Able.</HI> Is it not <HI>promised? All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth; unto such as keep His Covenant, and His Testimo|nies.</HI> Is it not <HI>promised? They that Sow in Tears, shall Reap in Joy;</HI> And, <HI>Light is
<PB N="126" REF="001127_0131_0FB0679F1972A218">
sown for the Righteous, and Joy for the Up|righ in Heart.</HI> These, even such as These, are to be our <HI>Songs, all the Night long.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Gain</HI> of our Affliction, is a <HI>Song</HI> that hath considerable matters of Consolation in it. Let us make a brief <HI>Descant</HI> upon some of them.</P>
<P>First, We may make it our <HI>Song in the Night; That our God Loves us too well, to burt us in the worst that He shall do unto us.</HI> We have such a <HI>Song</HI> prepared for us; Heb 12 6. <HI>Whom the Lord Loveth, He Chasteneth.</HI> What are the most afflict|ing Dispensations, but <HI>Fatherly,</HI> but <HI>Medi|cinal?</HI> When we can sigh perhaps with the Psalmist, <HI> I am afflicted very much:</HI> Yet let us also <HI>Sing, In whose Hands am I all this while? In the Hands of the best Friend that ever I had! In the Hands of a God, that hath Loved me very much; a God that hath for me, an Everlasting Love, and is now but Ex|ecuting for me the purposes of His Love.</HI> Our Afflictions may be with a <HI>Song;</HI> Why, Because they are without a <HI>Sting.</HI> The <HI>Curse</HI> and the <HI>Sting</HI> of all our Afflictions, hath fallen upon our Lord Jesus Christ, in the Day when <HI>God laid upon Him the Iniquity of us all,</HI> and when He cried out,
<PB N="127" REF="001127_0132_0FB067A253E66028">
<HI>I am the man that hath seen Affliction by the Rod of His wrath.</HI> We may <HI>Sing</HI> under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> our <HI>Disgrace; My Lord Jesus Christ we despised and rejected of men</HI> We may <HI>Sing</HI> under all our <HI>Straits; My Lord Jesus Christ had not an House where to lay His Head.</HI> We may <HI>Sing</HI> under all our <HI>Pains; My Lord Jesus Christ was feeble and sorely broken.</HI> Under all our <HI>Temptations,</HI> We may Sing, <HI>My Lord Jesus Christ was in all points Tempted like unto us; except only in sin.</HI> We may behold our Lord Jesus Christ, as by all these His <HI>Expiatory Suffer|ings,</HI> taking upon Himself the Vengeance of God, which was due to us for our <HI>Sins;</HI> &amp; hence it comes to pass that there is not that vengeance now to Embitter <HI>our Sufferings.</HI> Our Lord Jesus Christ hath <HI>Reconciled</HI> God unto us; and so none of His Dispensations are now the Blows of an <HI>Enemy</HI> and a <HI>Revenger.</HI> It may then be our <HI>Song;</HI> <Q>Lord, I will praise thee; for though thou wast Angry with me, thine Anger is turned away; and this doth comfort me, even when thou dost Afflict me. My Lord JESUS CHRIST hath given me to stand before God, in His perfect and spotless Righteousness,
<PB N="128" REF="001127_0133_0FB067A38E493618">
and no Evil shall happen to the Righ|teous.</Q></P>
<P>Again; We may make it our <HI>Song in the Night, That the worst that ever happens unto us, will be</HI> for our Good. We have such a <HI>Song</HI> prepared for us; Rom 8. 28. <HI>All things shall work together for Good, unto them that Love God.</HI> See and Sing the <HI>Mystery of Providence!</HI></P>
<P>Most certainly, 'Tis <HI>Good</HI> for us to be made Acquainted with the Concerns of <HI>Experimental Religion.</HI> Well; Our <HI>Night</HI> comes, that we may see the bright <HI>Stars</HI> of Christianity. Our God will shut us up in the <HI>Dark,</HI> that He may cure our <HI>Madness.</HI> It was the <HI>Song;</HI> Psal 94. 12. <HI>Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Lord, and teachest him out of thy Law.</HI> Ac|cordingly. Let it be <HI>Our Song in the Night;</HI> <Q>God is now making me a better infor|med Christian than ever I was in my Life; God is making me more thorow|ly to understand, that Christ is precious, and Sin is odious, and my Heart is De|ceitful, and all things here below are but Vanities and Vexations.</Q></P>
<P>Most certainly, Tis <HI>Good</HI> for us to be Restrained from <HI>Sin,</HI> and have <HI>Sin</HI> Destroy|ed
<PB N="129" REF="001127_0134_0FB067A9E83CFAC8">
in us. Well; our <HI>Night</HI> comes upon us, to keep us from the <HI>Works of Darkness.</HI> God sends our <HI>Night</HI> upon us, to make us <HI>Children of the Day.</HI> It was the <HI>Song;</HI> Isa. 27. 9. <HI>By this will Iniquity be purged, and all the Fruit is to take away sin.</HI> Accordingly, let it be our <HI>Song in the Night;</HI> <Q>God is now making my Sin bitter to me; All this Bitterness comes upon me, that so my Sin may be the more Embittered. God Kills my little Delights; Tis that my Sin may dye, and that my soul may live.</Q></P>
<P>Most certainly, Tis <HI>Good</HI> for us to be made more <HI>Gracious,</HI> and in the acting of <HI>Grace</HI> to be made more <HI>Fruitful.</HI> Well, our <HI>Night</HI> comes upon us, that so, the <HI>Dowes of Heaven</HI> may more fall upon our Souls. God visits us with a <HI>Night;</HI> but it is that so He may <HI>Awake</HI> us out of our <HI>Sleep.</HI> It was the <HI>Song;</HI> Heb. 12 10. <HI>He chastens us for our profit, that we might be partakers of His Holiness.</HI> Accordingly, Let it be our <HI>Song in the Night;</HI> <Q>What is my God now a doing? He is now making my Faith more Assur'd, my Hope more Lively my Love more Ardent, my Prayer more Fer|vent, my Patience more Confirm'd, and
<PB N="130" REF="001127_0135_0FB067AB00C7C888">
my whole Obedience more Exact. God is hewing and squaring of me, to render me a more Serviceable Stone in His Temple, and throwing me into a Fur|nace, that I may come out a vessel of more Honour to Himself.</Q></P>
<P>Finally; The <HI>Songs of Deliverance;</HI> why should not they be heard with us? We may make it our <HI>Song in the Night, That it will</HI> not always <HI>be Night; the Night will</HI> not always <HI>last.</HI> We have such a <HI>Song</HI> prepared for us; Psal. 30. 5. <HI>Weeping may Endure for a Night, but Joy cometh in the Morning.</HI> Be the <HI>Night</HI> never so tempestu|ous, it won't be long before <HI>the Day break, and the Dark shadows flee away.</HI> Of <HI>Heaven</HI> we read, <HI>There is no Night in that City of God.</HI> In all our <HI>Nights</HI> on <HI>Earth,</HI> we should Solace our selves with the <HI>Songs</HI> of <HI>Heaven.</HI> Yea, we should count it alwayes <HI>Night</HI> with us, till we come to <HI>Heaven.</HI> In this passage, <HI>Where is God my Maker, who giveth Songs in the Night?</HI> some have thought a special Reference to the <HI>Resurrection,</HI> which the Dead <HI>Saints</HI> are with <HI>Songs</HI> waiting for.

not do? to rescue us from our Miseries!</P>
<P><HI>Know,</HI> Next; That our Lord JESUS CHRIST hath paid the <HI>price</HI> of our <HI>Re|demption,</HI> from the Enemies of our Souls. We had all of us made our selves <HI>Prisoners; Prisoners</HI> we were too in an horrible Gaol that was on a light Fire over us. The Doom which we were continually wait|ing for, was that, Ezek. 18. 4. <HI>The Soul that Sins, it shall Dy.</HI> The dreadful <HI>Ju|stice</HI> of God, had put us over into the Hands of terrible <HI>Destroyers;</HI> a <HI>Destructi|on from God,</HI> which might justly be a <HI>Terrour</HI> unto unto us, was going to be inflicted on us, by their Hands. There was no way for us to escape it, but by Laying down a <HI>price,</HI> which might make a Compensation for the wrong done by our Sin unto the Infinite GOD There needed a <HI>price,</HI> to buy off our Obligati|ons, to suffer the vengeance of Heaven, and to repair those Apprehensions of a <HI>Righteous</HI> and <HI>Holy</HI> God Engraved on the minds of men, which we had gone to deface.

the precious Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> And we are informed, Tit. 2. 14. <HI>Jesus Christ gave Himself for us, that He might Redeem us.</HI></P>
<P>Know Thirdly; That our Lord JESUS CHRIST, by His Mighty <HI>Power</HI> does pro|secute, and accomplish our <HI>Redemption</HI> from the reach of those Enemies. Not only the <HI>Merit,</HI> of our Lord, is tendered for our <HI>Redemption,</HI> but the <HI>Spirit,</HI> the <HI>Vertue,</HI> the <HI>Power</HI> of our Lord, is used, for the <HI>Application</HI> of the <HI>Redemption.</HI> We read, Col. 2. 15. <HI>He hath spoiled Powers.</HI> Our Lord <HI>Redeemer,</HI> hath, like an Illustrious Conqueror, come into the black Territo|ries, where the <HI>Powers of Darkness</HI> held us in <HI>Chains of Darkness;</HI> Whereupon there follows, <HI>A Liberty, a Liberty for the Cap|tives, an Opening of the Prison doors for them that were bound.</HI> By the powerful Influ|ences of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Fet|ters of <HI>Sin,</HI> upon the <HI>Wills</HI> of the <HI>Elect</HI> are taken off; they are brought out of the <HI>Unbelief,</HI> wherein they were <HI>Shut up:</HI> there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Faith</HI> wrought in their Hearts, by which they are made the actual partakers of <HI>Re|demption;</HI> &amp; so they are <HI>turned from Dark|ness to Light, and from Satan to God,</HI> By

<P>Know, Fourthly, That our Lord JESUS CHRIST, accomplishing of our <HI>Redempti|on,</HI> does also <HI>Revenge</HI> our Cause upon our Enemies. Our Lord most Emphatically does the part of a <HI>Redeemer</HI> for us, in <HI>Re|venging</HI> the mischiefs, which have been done to our Souls, by our mischievous Ad|versaries. Have our Souls been murdered by <HI>Sin? O Sin,</HI> our Lord Jesus Christ will take a thorough <HI>Revenge</HI> upon thee. <HI>Sin</HI> that has been our <HI>Death,</HI> does it self undergo <HI>Death,</HI> by the Blood and Grace of our <HI>Lord Redeemer.</HI> We read this; Rom 6. 6. <HI>Knowing this, that the Old man is Crucifyed with Him, that the Body of Sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve Sin.</HI> And shall <HI>Satan</HI> escape? <HI>Satan,</HI> who hath deceived us, enslaved us,

<P>Know Fifthly; That at and by a Bles|sed <HI>Resurrection from the Dead,</HI> our Lord JESUS CHRIST will bestow upon us a full <HI>Redemption</HI> from all Evils and Enemies. What means our <HI>Job,</HI> when he says, <HI>I know my Redeemer?</HI> He means, <HI>I know, that the Messiah will Raise me from the Dead at the latter Day, tho' my Reins be consumed within me, and I know, that at the Resurrection.

But <HI>then,</HI> we shall never have any thing to <HI>Trouble</HI> us, World without end.</P>
<P>Finally; At the <HI>Resurrection from the Dead,</HI> our Lord Jesus Christ, will fully <HI>Re|deem</HI> us from the <HI>Grave,</HI> and from the Do|minion of <HI>Death</HI> over us in the <HI>Grave.</HI> Our Song may be that; Psal. 49. 15. <HI>God will Redeem my Soul, from the power of the Grave.

<P>Christians, We are to Know all this when we say, <HI>I know that there is a Redeemer.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. We may infallibly <HI>Know,</HI> That this <HI>our Lord Redeemer Lives</HI></P>
<P>There are <HI>Two Natures</HI> in the <HI>Person</HI> of our <HI>Lord Redeemer;</HI> and with Respect unto <HI>both</HI> of them, we may say, <HI>He Lives.</HI></P>
<P>First; Our Lord Jesus Christ is GOD; and thus, tis one of His Attributes, <HI>He Lives for ever and ever. Immortality</HI> is one of His Perfections: He is <HI>from Everlasting to Everlasting.</HI> The <HI>Deity</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ, is the Belief of every True Believer. That man is at best but a <HI>Bastard Christian,</HI> who denies the <HI>Deity</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ. Our Lord were no Sufficient <HI>Re|deemer</HI> for us, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> He were not very GOD.

of JEHOVAH is given to our Lord JE|SUS CHRIST, all the Bible over; A Name Incommunicable to any but GOD&punc; and a Name which implies, That He is the <HI>Everliving God,</HI> the <HI>Ever Being</HI> one. The Doxology of Him, was that, Rom. 9. 5. <HI>He is over all, God Blessed for ever.</HI> We may so carry it on; <HI>We have a Redeemer, who is over all, God Living for ever.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly; Our Lord Jesus Christ is MAN. Indeed this man was <HI>Crucified</HI> and <HI>Murdered;</HI> and He was in <HI>Hades</HI> or the <HI>State of the Dead,</HI> for part of <HI>Three Dayes and Nights.</HI> But what is He, and where is He now? <HI>He Lives.</HI> If we now look for our great <HI>Redeemer</HI> in His Grave, we shall soon be advised, as they were, Luk 24. 6. <HI>He is not here, He is Rison</HI> Yea, our Lord, being <HI>Received up into Glory,</HI> Writes a Letter from Heaven to His Church on Earth, with this Advice; Rev. 1. 18 <HI>I am He that Lives; tho' I was Dead, behold, I am Alive now for ever more.</HI> Tis a remarkable passage, that fellows upon our Text: <HI>He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> stand at the last upon the Earth</HI> An horrible Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">el between the <HI>Messiah,</HI> and the <HI>Serpent,</HI> is foretold in the <HI>Third Chapter of Genesis.</HI> The <HI>Earth</HI> was to be the Field

of this Battel. In the Battel, the <HI>Messiah</HI> has His <HI>Heel bruised,</HI> or His Humanity, that of Him which was next unto the <HI>Earth,</HI> became ob|noxious to the stroke of Mortality. But the <HI>Serpent</HI> is over-come; the <HI>Messiah</HI> over-comes him, and <HI>stands at the last upon the Earth,</HI> with <HI>Satan bruised under His Feet.</HI> That <HI>standing</HI> of our Lord-Redeemer <HI>at the last upon the Earth,</HI> is fulfilled in H<HI>is Rising from the Dead.</HI> Holy <HI>Job,</HI> Didst thou then Expect, like thy <HI>Messiah</HI> to be <HI>at the last</HI> victorious?

<P>The <HI>Resurrection</HI> of our L<HI>ord Redeemer</HI> is a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hing acknowledged by us, when we say, <HI>My Redeemer Lives.</HI> And the <HI>Life</HI> of <HI>Christianity</HI> it self mightily turns upon this Acknowledgment.

of the Christian Religion, Give At|tention to the chief, but brief, Heads of the proof, That <HI>our Redeemer Lives.</HI></P>
<P>First, The <HI>Disciples</HI> of our L<HI>ord Redeem|er</HI> were <HI>Witnesses,</HI> and they are very credi|ble and sufficient <HI>Witnesses,</HI> of His <HI>Resurre|ction to Life.</HI> Our Lord having foretold. That in Three Dayes after His <HI>Death,</HI> He would Rise <HI>from the Dead,</HI> this was a thing that stuck in the Stomachs of His Murde|rers. For this cause we find, Mat. 27 65, 66. <HI>Pilate said unto them, ye have a Watch, go your way, make the Sepulchre as sure as you can. So they went, and made the Sepulchre sure, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">aling the Stone, and setting a Watch,</HI> Now, we are very certain, That the Disci|ples of our Lord came, and found the <HI>Stone</HI> rolled away from His Grave, &amp; His Grave without any thing but His <HI>Linnen</HI> remaining in it This was a <HI>Matter of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ct,</HI> so notorious, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> the Evangelists would never have written it if it could have been capable of meeting with any contradiction.

Desert their <HI>Dying Master,</HI> would have the Courage to attempt an armed and zealous <HI>Watch</HI> placed upon Him, when He was <HI>Dead?</HI> Is it credible, That a <HI>Great Sons</HI> could be rolled away, and the <HI>Watch</HI> about it not be waked? Why was not the <HI>Watch</HI> punished for their Negligence in a business of this vast Importance, if their Superiours were not now conscious of a Forgery with them? It is credible, That if the Disciples had Stole away the <HI>Body</HI> of our Lord, they would have staid carefully and handsomely to leave His <HI>Linnen</HI> behind them? Finally, Let this Idle Tale of the <HI>Watch</HI> be defend|ed, if it can, from the <HI>Dilemma,</HI> that <HI>Austin</HI> put upon it; Either they said <HI>False,</HI> when they said, <HI>They Slept;</HI> and then, who would believe such <HI>Lyars</HI> in the rest of what they said?

<P>First; Most certainly, you want a <HI>Re|deemer:</HI> Though none more than they that least feel it, or think it! By our Fall from God, we are fallen into the Hands of Divine Justice; even into those <HI>Hands of the Living God, which it is a Fearful Thing to fall into</HI> Starting from our Obe|dience to the <HI>Law</HI> of our Creation, we

And now, whither wilt thou flee, poor Sinner, from the Hands of Divine Justice; where <HI>wilt thou flee from the presence of the Lord,</HI> and from the power of His Justice? No <HI>Mountains</HI> can hide thee; no <HI>Rocks</HI> can co|ver thee. Oh! Tis impossible for us to <HI>Redeem</HI> our selves from the <HI>Bonds of Death</HI> which Ly upon us. Yea, <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Lust</HI> also hold us <HI>Captives;</HI> we are under the oppressing and enslaving, and captivating influences of our Sins; our <HI>Lusts</HI> are so many <HI>Cords of Hell</HI> upon our Souls.

Secondly; You have an Offer of a <HI>Re|deemer:</HI> Horrible your madness, if you slight it!

<P>Thirdly; If you have not the Lord Jesus Christ for a R<HI>edeemer,</HI> what will be|come of you? It is a Question, which I wish, you would all take into considerati|on; but neither you, nor all the Angels in Heaven can answer it! It is that; Heb. 2. 3. <HI>How shall we escape, if we neglect so great</HI> S<HI>alvation?</HI> Truly, As the <HI>Cloudy Pil|lar,</HI> wherein our <HI>Lord</HI> R<HI>edeemer</HI> of old Ex|hibited Himself, gave <HI>Light</HI> unto the <HI>Israe|lites,</HI> but gave <HI>Darkness</HI> to the <HI>Egyptians:</HI> Thus, while our Lord Jesus Christ is a R<HI>e|deemer</HI> to them that Embrace Him, He will be a R<HI>evenger,</HI> a <HI>Punisher,</HI> a <HI>Destroyer</HI> to them who Refuse Him, and will <HI>not have Him to</HI> R<HI>eign over them.</HI> Wo to us, Inconceivable and Interminable will be our <HI>Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s,</HI> if the R<HI>edeemer,</HI> become our <HI>Enemy:</HI> And verily, He will do so, if we despise His R<HI>edemption.</HI> All the plagues written in the Book of God, will be the portion of the man, whom the Lord Jesus Christ

<P>Fourthly; You may not only <HI>Have,</HI> but also come to <HI>Know,</HI> that you have, the Lord Jesus Christ for <HI>your own Redeemer.</HI> O Precious and Peerless Happiness!

Christians, Come taste some <HI>Hon&egrave;y out of the Rock;</HI> and make some agreeable Conclusions.</P>
<P>Conclude, first; I know that my Redeemer Lives; <HI>and I Know that the Glorious Gospel of my Redeemer, is the Scrip|ture of Truth.</HI> Truly, The <HI>Life</HI> of the R<HI>e|deemer,</HI> is a most Lively proof of the <HI>Truth</HI> in all that His <HI>Gospel</HI> hath Revealed unto us. About one signal point of the Gospel, we read, Act. 17 31. <HI>God hath given As|surance of it, in that He hath Raised Jesus Christ from the Dead.</HI> This may be said about all the <HI>Mysteries,</HI> and all the <HI>Command|ments,</HI> and all the <HI>Promises</HI> of the Gospel; <HI>We have Assurance of these things, from the Life of our Lord</HI> R<HI>edeemer,</HI> Our Lord Jesus Christ hath laid before us, a most Excellent <HI>Body of Divinity</HI> in the Gospel. Well; <HI>How shall we know that the Gospel contains none but the True Sayings of God?</HI> Our <HI>Lord</HI> R<HI>edeemer</HI> Himself thus answered that Enquiry; <HI>If you see that I</HI> R<HI>ise again within two or three Dayes after I am Dead, then say, that I have delivered unto you, none but the True Sayings of God; and Believe my Faith|ful Sayings.</HI> Christians, we now <HI>See</HI> it; Oh, Let us <HI>Believe: Believe</HI> that our <HI>Lord-Redeemer</HI>
<PB N="177" REF="001127_0182_0FB0683082245AE8">
was no <HI>Deceiver</HI> in any thing, that ever He bid us <HI>Believe.</HI></P>
<P>Conclude, Secondly; I know that my Redeemer Lives; <HI>and I Know that the God of Heaven has accepted the</HI> R<HI>ansome which was paid for me by my</HI> R<HI>edeemer</HI> Does the R<HI>edeemer Live?</HI> Then the R<HI>edeemed</HI> shall never <HI>Dy.</HI> He hath said, Joh. 6 57. <HI>As I Live by the Father, so he that believeth in me shall Live by me.</HI> In the L<HI>ife</HI> of our L<HI>ord</HI> R<HI>edeemer,</HI> we see God the Father, giving our <HI>Surety</HI> an <HI>Acquittance</HI> for all the <HI>Debts,</HI> wherewith He stood charged on our Account. Lo, Our <HI>Surety</HI> is L<HI>iving,</HI> and let out of Prison, in being Restored unto L<HI>ife.</HI> Our Omnipotent <HI>Creditor</HI> sent His <HI>Angels</HI> to open the Door, (to roll away the Stone,) and let Him out of Prison. It is said, <HI>The God of Peace hath brought again from the Dead our</HI> L<HI>ord Jesus Christ.</HI> If God had not been <HI>at Peace,</HI> and if the Death of our Lord had not made a full Attonement, He would not have <HI>brought Him again from the Dead.</HI> When we say, <HI>My</HI> R<HI>edeemer</HI> L<HI>ives,</HI> God sayes, <HI>By the</HI> R<HI>ighteousness of that</HI> R<HI>edeemer I am well pleased.</HI> If one farthing demanded for the R<HI>ansome</HI> of Souls had been Left unpaid, our L<HI>ord-Redeemer</HI> had

still had His <HI>Grave Clothes</HI> upon Him: whereas now, <HI>O</HI> L<HI>ord, I will praise thee; for tho' thou wast Angry with me, thine Anger is turned away.</HI></P>
<P>Conclude, Thirdly; I know, that my Redeemer Lives; <HI>And I Know, that I have the Intercession of my</HI> R<HI>edeemer Employ'd for me before the Throne of God.</HI> Our L<HI>ord.</HI> R<HI>edeemer</HI> L<HI>ives;</HI> But what for? We are told Heb 7. 25. He ever L<HI>ives to make in|tercession for us.</HI> It is as our <HI>High Priest,</HI> that our Lord works out R<HI>edemption</HI> for us. Having dispatch'd the first part of His <HI>Priest hood</HI> in making <HI>Satisfaction</HI> for us, He passes unto the other part of it; and in the <HI>Holy of Holies,</HI> in the <HI>Heaven of Heavens,</HI> He makes <HI>Intercession</HI> for us. There He re|presents before the Eternal God, what He has done to make <HI>Expiation</HI> for our Sins. There He <HI>Sollicits,</HI> that what has been <HI>Pur|chased</HI> for us, may be <HI>Bestowed</HI> on us. Our <HI>Prayers</HI> are all of them Sorry <HI>Chatt'rings:</HI> we are prone to Suspect, That they signify nothing. But now Remember, <HI>My</HI> R<HI>e|deemer</HI> L<HI>ives, and He is concerned for me in the Court of Heaven, and now surely, the God and Father of my</HI> R<HI>edeemer, will give me Grace, and give me Glory, and withold no good

thing from me.</HI> Have we a L<HI>iving</HI> R<HI>edeem|er?</HI> we have then a L<HI>iving Advocate,</HI> And, Oh, how Powerfully, how Livelily does He plead our cause!</P>
<P>Conclude, Fourthly; I know that my Redemer Lives: <HI>And I know that my</HI> R<HI>edeemer will at last, and e're long bring me to Live with Him.</HI> Does our R<HI>edeemer Live?</HI> True; But His Character is also that of our F<HI>orerunner.</HI> We are taught, Heb. 6. 20 <HI>He is a Forerunner for us, En|tred within the Vail.</HI> He L<HI>ives;</HI> and it is, that He may <HI>prepare Mansions,</HI> blessed Chambers and Lodgings for us, in the <HI>Temple</HI> of His God. He <HI>Lives;</HI> and it is, that He might fetch us up to that L<HI>ife,</HI> and L<HI>ight,</HI> in which He L<HI>ives.</HI> He L<HI>ives;</HI> Hence Learn, Ye R<HI>edeemed,</HI> and <HI>Know,</HI> That shortly you are to L<HI>ive with Him,</HI> &amp; <HI>be for ever with the Lord.</HI> When <HI>Death</HI> ar|rives unto us, we may without any Ter|rors, cheerfully Entertain the <HI>King of Ter|rors,</HI> and say, <HI>My</HI> R<HI>edeemer Lives, and my Life is bid with God in Him, and I am now going unto Him.</HI></P>

<P>I Am this Day <HI>my self</HI> a sad Commen|tary upon <HI>my Text.</HI> The Holy God hath, in my <HI>Deadly Calamity,</HI> given you its <HI>Lively Commentary.</HI> Your <HI>Eyes</HI> do <HI>behold,</HI> What it is for the God of Heaven, to <HI>take away from a Son of Man the Desire of his Eyes with a Stroks.</HI></P>
<P>That one of so little Use or Worth as I am, and one who-hath so much deserv|ed the Displeasure of Heaven, should feel such a <HI>Stroke</HI> from God, no body may wonder at it. But why must such an E|minent <HI>Man of God,</HI> as the Prophet <HI>Ezeki|el,</HI> be thus dealt withal? The Blessed God
<PB N="192" REF="001127_0197_0FB0686006974950">
would not only Try the <HI>vertue</HI> of His Holy Servant, but also make the Trial of the <HI>Prophet,</HI> a thing <HI>Prophetical</HI> of what was to come upon all the <HI>People.</HI> It is often so, that the things befalling of one Considerable person, who hath been much concerned for the Welfare of a people, are <HI>Ominous</HI> of what is to befal all the people for whom he hath been concern|ed. The Case of <HI>David,</HI> in the Fifty first Psalm; the Fate of <HI>Miriam,</HI> in her Le|prosy and Exclusion; &amp; many more such Things, were Types of what was to befal the <HI>Israelitish</HI> Nation. The <HI>Angels</HI> of the Seven Churches, had in their Condition, that of their Churches. Tho' this Mini|ster of God, our <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> was a most un|sported <HI>Liver,</HI> and a most excellent <HI>Preach|er,</HI> and his Hearers would also confess him to be so, yet he had <HI>Enemies</HI> among them: Heaven took Notice of it, with much of|fence at it. <HI>Son of Man, The Children of thy people are still talking against thee.</HI> It may be, some of these would be so malignant, as to Rejoice in the <HI>Affliction</HI> that now be|fel him. <HI>Rejoyce not against me, O mine Enemies,</HI> (might our Prophet now say;) <HI>for the Affliction upon my Family, is but a sign
<PB N="193" REF="001127_0198_0FB0686655AECBE8">
of a greater Confusion to come upon the Pub|lick</HI> When God was going to cast off a people, whom He had once Espoused and <HI>Married</HI> unto Himself, He does by Death cut off the happy <HI>Marriage,</HI> which there had been between His Prophet &amp; a Daugh|ter of <HI>Israel.</HI> When God was going to deprive the people of the <HI>Dear Enjoyments,</HI> which their <HI>Hearts</HI> were most of all set up|on. He takes away from His Prophet the <HI>Dearest Thing</HI> he had in the world. And, because the Judgments coming upon that people, would be such, that they should not have liberty to <HI>Mourn</HI> with due Com|passion and Solemnity for one another, therefore the Lord forbids now unto His Prophet, the solemn Rites of <HI>Mourning,</HI> which else on this <HI>mournful</HI> Occasion had been proper for him. <HI>Thus Ezekiel, is un|to you a Sign, saith the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>We have in the words before us, the <HI>preparation</HI> for this grievous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></P>
<P>There is, First, A <HI>Commination</HI> to the Prophet. The Thing threatned unto him is, A Death; and as distressing a <HI>Death</HI> as could have come upon him; his own <HI>Death</HI> would not have been more uneasy.</P>
<P>The <HI>Subject</HI> of the <HI>Death</HI> here threatned,
<PB N="194" REF="001127_0199_0FB066CE09A72160">
is, <HI>The Desire of his Eyes;</HI> That is to say, His <HI>Wife;</HI> who it seems, was a very Love|ly person, and a person whom he Loved very much to <HI>Look</HI> upon: His <HI>Eyes,</HI> He thought, could not be charm'd with a more Desirable Creature.</P>
<P>The <HI>manner</HI> of the <HI>Death</HI> here threatned is, <HI>With a Stroke;</HI> That is to say, very sud|denly. She did not Ly Languishing for many months; he had not opportunity by long Languishments upon her, to fortify his mind against the Loss that was now to be|fal him Some <HI>quick Disaster</HI> snatch'd away from him, the brightest Jewel he had in his House; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> had but <HI>Short warning</HI> of the <HI>sore Trouble</HI> that was now coming upon him: She Died that very Night.

<P>But, then, there is a <HI>Compellation</HI> of the Prophet. <HI>Son of M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n</HI> A Title rear one hundred times over address'd unto him.

Familiarity with the <HI>Angels</HI> of God: The <HI>Angels</HI> of Heaven flew down to them in their Studies, and ravished them with Sen|sible and most Heavenly Communications.

I. The <HI>Children of men</HI> are sometimes Blessed with such <HI>Desirable Relatives,</HI> as may be very justly called, The Desire of their Eyes. The <HI>Blessed</HI> God makes a various Distribution of His <HI>Blessings</HI> among the <HI>Children of men.</HI> But not the least of those <HI>Blessings</HI> are Enwrapped in the <HI>Rela|tions</HI> which the <HI>Children of men</HI> bear to one another. Inasmuch as we are the <HI>Children of men,</HI> we are in divers respects <HI>Related</HI> unto one another; &amp; the All wise <HI>Maker</HI> and <HI>Ruler</HI> of the World has made a manifold provision for our mutual Com|fort, in those <HI>Relations.</HI></P>
<P>Now, 'tis a <HI>Special Favour</HI> of God, gran|ted unto <HI>some,</HI> among the <HI>Children of men,</HI> that <HI>Relatives</HI> can take much Delight in one another. Indeed sometimes 'tis other wise; and it is a fearful <HI>Curse</HI> upon the <HI>Children of men</HI> when 'tis otherwise. <HI>Re|latives</HI> there are, who have no <HI>Desire,</HI> but rather a <HI>Distaste</HI> of one another; so little do they <HI>Desire,</HI> that they can't <HI>Endure</HI> one another. Their <HI>Persons</HI> their <HI>Tempers,</HI> their <HI>Manners</HI> make them so Disagreeable to one another, that they do not <HI>Love,</HI> but <HI>Loath</HI> each other. It is not altogether unusual in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> world, that Relatives are not
<PB N="197" REF="001127_0202_0FB066D499C601D8">
only <HI>Weary of each other,</HI> but also make each other <HI>weary of the World</HI> Thus the Lady of old, made that complaint about her Daughters in Law; Gen 27 46. <HI>I am weary of my Life because of them.</HI> Never|theless, there are many Instances of that Compassion in our Good God upon the un worthy <HI>Children of men;</HI> That <HI>Relatives</HI> are made highly <HI>Desirable</HI> and <HI>Agreeable</HI> to one another.</P>
<P>And it is especially thus in the Conju|gal Relation. The <HI>God of Love</HI> some|times Disposes them, whom He has made <HI>Consorts</HI> in the <HI>Conjugal Relation,</HI> greatly to love and prize one another. The <HI>Consorts</HI> are to each other, the <HI>Desire of their Eyes;</HI> &amp; they so Love each other, that they Love to be as much as may be in the <HI>Sight</HI> of each other. About the one of these Relatives, tis said, Prov. 18. 22. <HI>He that findeth it, find|eth a Good Thing, and obtaineth Favour of the Lord.</HI> And that is the opinion which <HI>both</HI> of them have of each other: <HI>This is a Good and a Great Gift of God unto me! Highly fa|voured of God was I, in His Giving of it.</HI> It may be, before they were first Acquain|ted, they humbly Cried unto God, that He would Choose for them, what <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI>
<PB N="198" REF="001127_0203_0FB066D961C81628">

Sometimes when a <HI>Sentence of Death</HI> is passed upon our <HI>Desireable Relatives,</HI> we may by <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Faith</HI> obtain a short <HI>Re|prieve.</HI> The <HI>Relatives</HI> may be <HI>Prayer</HI> and <HI>Faith,</HI> be rescued from the Jaws of Death, one time after another; until the Lord shall say unto us; <HI>Now be content; I have granted as long as I see convenient: Say no more: Be willing to take up with Spiritual and Eternal Blessings, and with what I shall order for thee: what I do, thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter.</HI> And when our Hearts are perhaps thus fitted for it, <HI>Son of man, Behold, the Lord now takes away the Desire of thine Eyes with a Stroke.</HI> Though we bring the <HI>Desire of our Eyes</HI> unto the Lord, with never such a <HI>Fountain of Tears in our Eyes,</HI> and spread the <HI>Desire of our Souls</HI> with never such Importunity before Him, for the continuance of it; yet it must, when God sees meet, be <HI>taken away, Death</HI> will first or last, accomplish that <HI>Lamentable</HI> Thing; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> 2 4. <HI>He slow all the Desirea|ble of the Eye, in the Tabernacle of the Daugh|ter of Zion.</HI></P>

<P>But whence comes it? Let a <HI>Third Pro|position</HI> answer That.</P>
<P N="3">III. When <HI>Desireable Relatives</HI> are <HI>taken away</HI> from us, tis God that has taken them. We must have the <HI>Providence</HI> of God in our <HI>Eyes,</HI> when the <HI>Desire of our Eyes</HI> is taken away from us. Our <HI>Eyes</HI> must not be so put out, by our having the <HI>Desire of our Eyes</HI> taken away, that we shall not see the <HI>Hand of God</HI> in all that befalls us. There is the
<PB N="206" REF="001127_0211_0FB066ED57162030">
<HI>Providence</HI> of God, ordering and inflicting all the Afflictions, that befall the Children of men. As it was said, Amos 3. 6 <HI>Shall there be Evil in a City, and the Lord hath not done it?</HI> So we may say, <HI>Shall there be Evil in a Family, and it not be the Lords doing?</HI> To have <HI>Desireable Relatives</HI> taken away, is an Affliction of so much Consequence, that we had need think seriously, <HI>What Hand is it that Layes this Affliction upon us?</HI> Oh, Let us awfully think with our selves, <HI>I have to do with God, in this Dispensation.</HI> There is nothing to be ascribed unto <HI>Hap,</HI> &amp; <HI>Chance,</HI> and <HI>Fortune;</HI> Tis <HI>blind Paganism,</HI> to see no further than such a <HI>blind Original,</HI> for the loss of <HI>Desireable Relatives.</HI> Nor must we consider <HI>Diseases,</HI> or <HI>Accidents,</HI> as being in any higher Form, than that of <HI>Second Cau|ses.</HI> God the Great GOD, is to be consi|dered, as the <HI>First Cause</HI> of all. When any of our <HI>Desireable Relatives</HI> are taken away, we must say with him, Job 1. 21. <HI>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away.</HI> It is a vile Stupidity and Profanity, to be insensi|ble of a <HI>Divine Hand,</HI> Ordering, Disposing, Directing our loss of <HI>Desireable Relatives,</HI> when it comes upon us. When our Fami|lies are wounded, by having <HI>Desireable Re|latives</HI> taken out of them, if we <HI>Regard not
<PB N="207" REF="001127_0212_0FB066EEC514B478 ">
the works of the Lord, not the Operation of His Hands,</HI> we may fear, that He will go on in wounding of us; yea, that <HI>He will destroy us, and not build us up.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. And now, a <HI>Fourth Proposition</HI> comes to challenge a Share in my Discourse; which would have been, That when <HI>Desi|reable Relatives</HI> are <HI>taken away,</HI> there is a dreadful Stroke of God upon us, in the <HI>Taking</HI> of them. But my best way of Speaking to this <HI>Proposition,</HI> will be only to lay, <HI>That I am not at present well able to Speak to it; I do not yet know, all the Evil that is to be spoken to it.</HI> [Only I know what Pread in the <HI>Twelfth</HI> of <HI>Job,</HI> and the <HI>Fourteenth!</HI>] We will proceed therefore unto the</P>
<P>APPLICATION.</P>
<P N="1">I. Are the <HI>Children of men</HI> sometimes bles|sed with <HI>Desireable Relatives?</HI> Tis then a <HI>Lamentable</HI> Thing, when <HI>Relatives</HI> do not Study to render themselves <HI>Desireable.</HI> When <HI>Relatives</HI> have no <HI>Desire,</HI> no <HI>Respect,</HI> no <HI>Honour</HI> for one another, they are very unhappy in one another. The <HI>Yoking</HI> of such <HI>Relatives,</HI> is almost as great an unhap|piness, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he Torment invented by the Ty|ran, who fastned a <HI>Dead Body</HI> to a <HI>Living One, Relatives</HI> there are, who are not the
<PB N="208" REF="001127_0213_0FB066F04446FC68">
<HI>Desire of the Eyes</HI> to those, unto whom they stand Related; But, <HI>the Terror of their Eyes,</HI> or, <HI>The contempt of their Eyes;</HI> a very <HI>Smoke in their Eyes,</HI> and an abominable <HI>Eye sore;</HI> or, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">is Expressed, 1 Sam. 2 33. <HI>To consume their Eyes, and Grieve their Hearts.</HI> A most <HI>Lamentable</HI> Thing! When <HI>Relatives</HI> are so <HI>Little Desired,</HI> that they are taken away from each other, without being <HI>much La|mented.</HI> We read of such an one; 2 Chro. 21. 20. <HI>He departed, without being Desired.</HI></P>
<P>It is a <HI>Lamentable</HI> Thing, When <HI>Parents</HI> are so fierce, and harsh, or foolish, that the <HI>Children</HI> can have no <HI>Desire</HI> to appear in their presence. And it is a <HI>Lamentable</HI> Thing, when <HI>Children</HI> are so graceless and wicked, that the <HI>Parents</HI> have no <HI>Desire</HI> to have them appear before them.</P>
<P>It is a <HI>Lamentable</HI> Thing, when <HI>Brethren</HI> and <HI>Sisters,</HI> are of such Ill Qualities, that they don't care to see one another.</P>
<P>It is a <HI>Lamentable</HI> Thing, when <HI>Rulers</HI> are not such as <HI>People</HI> can <HI>Desire;</HI> but such <HI>Roaring Lions</HI> and <HI>Ranging Bears,</HI> that they would rejoyce to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of them. And it is a <HI>Lamentable</HI> Thing, when <HI>People</HI> are so unreasonably hard to please, that the <HI>Ru|lers,</HI> or any man of sense, would say, They
<PB N="209" REF="001127_0214_0FB066F1E7785EC0">
had rathar have the Government of <HI>Wild Creatures</HI> committed unto them.</P>
<P>We read concerning a Renowned <HI>Mi|nister</HI> of God; Dan. 9. 23. <HI>He was a man of Desires;</HI> a very <HI>Desirable</HI> man. It is a <HI>La|mentable</HI> Thing, when <HI>Ministers</HI> are so Ig|norant, or so Negligent, or so Criminal, that their Hearers have no Cause to <HI>Desire</HI> their Ministry; but wish, they would <HI>Lay down.</HI> And it is a Lamentable Thing, when <HI>Hearers</HI> are so Captious, or so ungrateful that the <HI>Ministers</HI> have no cause to <HI>Desire</HI> to have any thing to do with them.</P>
<P>It is most of all to be <HI>Lamented,</HI> when <HI>Consorts</HI> cannot make a <HI>Consort,</HI> but cease to be <HI>Desirable</HI> unto one another. Let all such <HI>Relatives,</HI> the most nearly <HI>Related</HI> of any under Heaven, beware of every thing that may reader them unacceptable unto one a|nother; and beware of all Tendencies or Temptations to weariness of one another. It is required. <HI>Eph.</HI> 5. 23 <HI>Let every one of you in particular, so Love his Wife even at himself, and the Wife see that she Reverence her Hus|band.</HI> Let the <HI>Fear of God</HI> cause you, to oblige one another, with all suitable Expres|sions of <HI>Goodness</HI> and <HI>Kindness;</HI> and set the <HI>Fear of God</HI> fill you with <HI>Love</HI> to one ano|ther.

<P>Remember, O Christians; our God is a <HI>Sovereign</HI> God.

Enjoy Him, when the finest <HI>Creature</HI> dyes. Tho' a <HI>Lovely Creature</HI> be Snatch'd from us, have we not a <HI>Lovely Jesus</HI> lest us for our Consolation? When the <HI>Desire of our Eyes</HI> is gone, we may still converse with Him, who should be the <HI>Desire of all Nati|ons.</HI> Why say we not now with him, Psal. 73 25. Lord, <HI>There is none upon Earth, that I desire besides thee?</HI> When <HI>David</HI> had lost the <HI>Desire of his Eyes,</HI> we read, <HI>He Encouraged himself in the Lord his God.</HI> Oh, Let this <HI>Encouragement</HI> make us very Patient; we still have <HI>the Lord for our God!</HI> In the <HI>Ma|rian</HI> Persecution, there was a Woman brought before the bloody Bishop of <HI>London,</HI> on the Score of the Gospel.

<P>Secondly; It is the <HI>Hand of God</HI> which
<PB N="217" REF="001127_0222_0FB0670A49382738">
takes away our <HI>Desireable Relatives:</HI> But let us Hear the <HI>Voice of God,</HI> in that work of His <HI>Hand.</HI> Oh, <HI>Hear the Rod;</HI> for there is a <HI>Voice</HI> in it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Voice</HI> of God unto us, in taking away the <HI>Desire of our Eyes</HI> is, <HI>Humble thy self under the mighty Hand of God.</HI> It is now, if ever, a Seaton for that Practice; Lam 3 40. <HI>Let us Search and Try our wayes, and Turn again un|to the Lord.</HI> Let us now, <HI>Search and Try,</HI> whe|ther the Just God have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Controversy</HI> with us. Now <HI>Search and Try,</HI> what may be the Sins, by which the <HI>Desire of our Eyes</HI> has been Confiscated. <HI>Search and Try,</HI> whether we did carry towards the <HI>Desire of our Eyes</HI> as we ought to do. Let this our <HI>Self Exa|mination</HI> issue in a deep <HI>Abhorrence</HI> of our selves, and a True <HI>Repentance</HI> of our Sins That, That is the Right <HI>Mourning,</HI> which is a <HI>Sorrowing to Repentance,</HI> and a being <HI>Sorry after a Godly manner.</HI> But now, by fresh Applications with Faith, to the <HI>Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, which cleanses from all Sin</HI> obtain the <HI>Pardon</HI> of all the Sins, whereof we do thus <HI>Repent.</HI> And, Oh, be very cautious of again calling into the Sins, or being like that man, of whom it is said, <HI>In the Time of His Distress, He Trespassed yet more against the Lord.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="001127_0223_0FB0670DDCB02D60">
Another <HI>Voice</HI> of God unto us, is, <HI>Be|strongly convinced of Humane Weakness and Frailty</HI> We read it in the Divine <HI>Oracle,</HI> Psal. 103 15, 16. <HI>As for man, his Days are as Grass, as a Flower of the Field, so he flou|risheth: For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone, and the place thereof shall know it no more.</HI> Do we not now read it in our own <HI>Experience?</HI> When we see <HI>Beauty</HI> turn'd in|to <HI>Ashes, Loveliness</HI> become <HI>Loathsomeness,</HI> the Greatest <HI>Charms</HI> become a prey to <HI>Worms,</HI> and the <HI>Desire of our Eyes</HI> become the <HI>Horror of our Eyes,</HI> how can we forbear crying out <HI>Lord, What Fading Flowers are these that we most of all dote upon! Lord When thou dost correct us with thy Rebukes, thou dost make our Beauty consume away like a moth, surely we are vanity.</HI></P>
<P>A Third <HI>Voice</HI> of God unto us, is, <HI>Pre|pare to Follow.</HI> When the <HI>Desire of our Eyes</HI> is taken away, the Language of it is, that; Mat. 24 44 <HI>Be ye also Ready.</HI> They that are gone from us, were a <HI>part of our selves,</HI> &amp; it may be not so <HI>Old as our selves.</HI> How inexcusable are we, if we do not say with our selves, <HI>I shall not be long after them?</HI> 'Twas the manner of old, for 'em to Lay and Leave their Friends in their

Is one <HI>Half</HI> of us already in a <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ssin?</HI> Surely it becomes us to expect that the <HI>Rest</HI> of us will soon be there. They that are gone <HI>from us,</HI> are gone but a very little <HI>before us.</HI></P>
<P>Oh! That we might <HI>now to Day hear the voice of God, and not harden our Hearts.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly; It is the <HI>Hand of God,</HI> which takes away our <HI>Desirable Relatives:</HI> Well then, <HI>watch</HI> very much against all the <HI>Tem|ptations of Satan,</HI> which may be likely to assault us under this <HI>Hand of God.</HI> Is the <HI>Desire of our Eyes</HI> taken away? It may now be said unto us; Luk. 22 31. <HI>Behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may Sift you as Wheat.</HI> All <HI>New Conditions</HI> have some <HI>New Temptations.</HI> When any Irksome Thing befals us, and especially when we are deprived of the <HI>Desire of our Eyes,</HI> than which, what can be more I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> is some? We may be sure, <HI>Satan</HI> will take advantage from it. For to have the <HI>Desire of our Eyes</HI> taken away, brings a <HI>Dark Time</HI> upon us. The <HI>Powers of Darkness</HI> may e're we are aware, hurry us on to unaccountable In|conveniencies. <HI>Now</HI> more than ever is

that Counsel seasonable; Mat. 26. 41. <HI>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into Temptation.</HI> If God by taking away the <HI>Desire of our Eyes,</HI> being us particularly into a State of <HI>Widow|hood,</HI> Oh! how sollicitous ought we to be, of an <HI>Holy Widowhood!</HI> But that, it may be so, it should be a very <HI>Prayerful</HI> one. The very <HI>First Thing</HI> we are to do, as soon as we can Look about us, methinks it should be to <HI>Pray,</HI> and <HI>Fast,</HI> and <HI>Weep</HI> in secret places before the Lord, and beg of God, that He would pardon all our miscarriages in our <HI>Former Condition,</HI> and preserve us from all further miscarriages in the New, and Sad <HI>Condition</HI> that is now come upon us. Alas, what <HI>wrong steps,</HI> what foolish ones, and what satal ones, are commonly taken in that State; by them who being <HI>Desolate, Continue not in Supplications &amp; Pray|ers night and day!</HI> And they are never more unhappily taken, man in precipitated pro|ceedings, unto <HI>Second Marriages.</HI> For tho' it were an indefensible <HI>Severity</HI> in many of the Ancients, absolutely to forbid them, nevertheless, tis a Dishonourable <HI>Levity</HI> to make <HI>too much Haste</HI> unto them, and espe|cially for those <HI>Aged</HI> men, to whom a <HI>Je|rom</HI> would say, <HI>Cogita te quotidie moriturum,

It becomes both Sexes, when the State of <HI>Widowhood</HI> is come upon them, to <HI>Converse with God,</HI> more than ever they did in their Lives before.</P>
<P>Lastly. It is the <HI>Hand of God,</HI> which takes away our <HI>Desirable Relatives:</HI> But let it be a very rich Anodyne and Cordial unto us, to think unto <HI>whom</HI> and <HI>what</HI> He has taken them. Were the <HI>Relatives</HI> rendred prin|cipally by the Fear and Grace of God, the <HI>Desire of our Eyes?</HI> The God, who has <HI>ta|ken them away,</HI> has then <HI>Taken them to Him|self.</HI> Were they <HI>In Christ?</HI> They are now <HI>With Christ where to be is by far the best of all:</HI> And as well as they Loved us, they would be loth to return from Him unto us. They were the <HI>Desire of our Eyes;</HI> but will it have no pacifying Influence upon us to think. They are gone, Where <HI>all Tears are wiped from their Eyes?</HI> The <HI>Relation</HI> between <HI>them</HI> and <HI>us</HI> is Lost, but the <HI>Remembrance</HI> of the <HI>Relation</HI> may con|tinue
<PB N="222" REF="001127_0227_0FB067176577D7B8">
more with <HI>them</HI> than with <HI>us.</HI> And when we <HI>meet</HI> them again in the <HI>Heaven|ly World,</HI> there will doubtless be some Rapturous Expressions of Gladness agree|able to the <HI>Heavenly State,</HI> upon the meet|ing of such as have been Instrumental to being each other unto it.</P>
<P>In fine; We Encounter many Grievan|ces in <HI>this present Evil World.</HI> Our <HI>Desirea|ble Relatives</HI> have got the Start of us, to the <HI>Blessedness</HI> of a <HI>Better World! We</HI> shall short|ly see the Period of all our Grievances, as well as they, and in the Society of them, that are got before us. And give me leave, to Conclude my Sermon, with the Words, wherewith the <HI>Desire of my Eyes,</HI> has newly Concluded her Life; Words, which I Pray God, help me to make the Solace of Mine: Heaven, Heaven will make Amends for all.</P>
