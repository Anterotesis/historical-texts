<HEAD><HI>Introduction,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>SOMETIMES human beings are unrea&s;onably charmed with novelty; and at other times reject that which is u&s;e|ful and good without &s;ufficient trial. What has appeared wrong, on account of &s;ome adventitious circum&s;tances, has been rejected, as wrong in its own nature. This has been exactly the ca&s;e with &s;chool exhibitions&mdash;They are in them&s;elves exceedingly u&s;eful&mdash;When they are proper|ly conducted they enlarge the ideas and poli&s;h the man|ners of &s;tudents. They &s;how an example of moral precepts repre&s;ented in real life&mdash;But by means of &s;ome injudicious attempts, the public mind &s;eems greatly prejudiced again&s;t them. It is &s;aid
<Q>they are expen&s;ive, that they encour|age profanity and vice; that the feelings of &s;tudents are often hurt by the di&s;tribution of parts&mdash;or their parents cruelly mortified&mdash;that &s;tudents acquire by them an in|decent confidence, and that they intrude upon &s;tudies more nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful than rhetoric&mdash;and they are imitations of a theatre, which is always a &s;eminary of vice.</Q>
Yet we believe, that they may be &s;o managed as not to be chargeable with any of the&s;e evils; but be pro|ductive of a mo&s;t innocent and rational amu&s;ement, and not only improve the outward carriage of the &s;tudents; but implant the mo&s;t u&s;eful morals in them; and in the minds of their friends, who attend their performances. And the de&s;ign of the introduction of this work, is to &s;how how this may be done. For per&s;picuity's &s;ake I &s;hall con&s;id|er my&s;elf as &s;peaking to a per&s;on who wi&s;hes to know my &s;entiments of an exhibition.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I. OF GUARDING AGAINST PREJUDICES.</HEAD>
<P>IT is vain for a &s;tudent, new from a univer&s;ity, to think of confronting the prejudices of a people by mere a&s;&s;er|tions; and confidently reprobating their opinions&mdash;Man|kind
<PB N="8" REF="034600_0005_0FFF10A45BBD5D38">
re&s;ent &s;uch treatment; and the prejudice is the &s;tron|ger from that very cau&s;e. It is be&s;t to begin with a &s;mall exhibition, and only a&s;k to &s;how a few pieces&mdash;Peo|ple are afraid of what is done in the dark&mdash;for that rea&s;on get &s;ome popular per&s;on or per&s;ons to look over your pieces before exhibition, and &s;how the utmo&s;t readine&s;s to have them rejected if thought improper. Then tell tho&s;e, who in&s;pect your pieces, by no means to admit &s;uch as they di&s;like. And if there be a &s;ingle word, or phra&s;e, which offends, let it be &s;truck out without mercy. If they &s;hould reject all but &s;imple dialogues, be content. But exhibit them in the mo&s;t advantageous manner.</P>
<P>When the audience can bear dialogues, the number of dialogi&s;ts may be increa&s;ed, and &s;oon it will be found that dramas, if not in them&s;elves offen&s;ive to religion and mor|als, will be perfectly harmle&s;s&mdash;Adhere to the &s;y&s;tem of correcting them perfectly before they are given out to the &s;tudents, by your&s;elf and by others. Women are gen|erally better judges of the delicacy of writings than men. &mdash;Apply then to &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible, and be&s;t edu|cated ladies, in the town, or di&s;trict, where you keep a &s;chool; and de&s;ire that they will examine your pieces, and note every pa&s;&s;age which offends them. Such pa&s;&s;ages mu&s;t all be &s;acrificed, and there is no lo&s;s in the ca&s;e &mdash;You will probably &s;ub&s;titute better phra&s;es in the room of tho&s;e excepted again&s;t, get a character for mode&s;ty, and acquire a purity of &s;tile in your original compo&s;itions.</P>
<P>Do not imagine that your pieces in order to plea&s;e mu&s;t be calculated, to excite laughter. Tho&s;e which excite the loude&s;t peals of mirth o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ten plea&s;e the lea&s;t on the whole. &mdash;People often laugh at buffoonery, and when they go away from the &s;cene, where they &s;aw it, are angry with, and condemn them&s;elves for being plea&s;ed, even for a mo|ment. You may in&s;ert diverting p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ces, and it is generally be&s;t in the cour&s;e of an exhibition, to have one or two that are laughable, but it is not advi&s;able to have your pieces mo&s;tly of that ca&s;t. Tho&s;e which are &s;ublime, which waken the mind and benevolent affections&punc; which excite the &s;entiments of piety or &s;hew moral principles to advantage, will plea&s;e all people who are not ideots or totally cor|rupted in their mental ta&s;te. Mo&s;t of the pieces performed at an exhibition &s;hould decidedly be of the u&s;eful kind&punc; and tho&s;e which are more diverting, &s;hould be perfectly harm|le&s;s
<PB N="9" REF="034600_0006_0FFF13F20B9D7AF0">
&mdash;It is be&s;t never to de&s;cend lower than tho&s;e which pro|mote politene&s;s and good humor.</P>
<P>Another thing &s;hould be attended to with great care. That none of the pieces be of &s;uch a nature as to bear even a plau&s;ible application to any per&s;on in the town, or di&s;|trict&punc; where you are, in the way of ridicule&mdash;The wounds of ridicule are incurable, and the attempt of taking off in|dividuals, is never forgiven.&mdash;Rather drop a diverting piece, or let vice pa&s;s unpuni&s;hed, than offer a direct affront to any per&s;on by an exhibition. And avoid all general &s;atire &mdash;It can never be ju&s;t&mdash;If a married man be a ridiculous character; let it be, becau&s;e he abu&s;es his wife or his chil|dren&mdash;If an old bachelor, becau&s;e he is mi&s;chievous and ill-natured&mdash;an old maid becau&s;e &s;he is vicious, and di&s;turbs the peace of families&mdash;a lawyer for knavery&mdash;a prie&s;t for keeping low company&mdash;a merchant for cheating&mdash;is lawful prize for ridicule. But nothing that is good or u&s;eful, or even harmle&s;s &s;hould be ridiculed&mdash;And good men and women are found in all the lawful employments of life&mdash; above all things religion&mdash;marriage&mdash;and nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful labor, &s;hould be exempted from ridicule.</P>
<P>Let not exhibitions be too expen&s;ive&mdash;People are gener|ally hurt by expence, and will not long love that which draws their money from them&mdash;In &s;ome in&s;tances, bands of mu&s;ic have been hired, a great expence has been incurred for dre&s;&s;es, decorations for a &s;tage, machines, and what not. Exhibitions can never become cu&s;tomary with all the&s;e appendages&mdash;They would bani&s;h them&s;elves by the mere co&s;t of maintaining them&mdash;Only reflect that you are at the head of a &s;chool, and are not the manager of a theatre, and you will avoid tho&s;e extremes&mdash;The object of &s;peaking in &s;chools is, to u&s;e the &s;tudent to a clear, and judicious mode of expre&s;&s;ion, and action, on all the occa&s;ions of life, and bu&s;ine&s;s. This may be provided for at a very &s;mall expence, as we &s;hall &s;how in another place.</P>
<P>Be very careful that the &s;entiments contained in your pieces be ju&s;t and philo&s;ophically true&mdash;that they be whol|ly purified from all prophane, ob&s;cene and low, black-guardly &s;entiments, and phra&s;es&mdash;and that the phra&s;es which expre&s;s humor, as tho&s;e peculiar to clowns, cits, &s;ailors, &s;oldiers &amp;c. be &s;uch, as will not offend per&s;ons of mod|e&s;ty and good ta&s;te. By the&s;e means you will avoid hav|ing a bad impre&s;&s;ion on the minds of the audience in the
<PB N="10" REF="034600_0007_0FFF10A6DBB9D2F8">
fir&s;t and mo&s;t &s;imple performances of rhetoric, and if they be performed well it will create a de&s;ire to hear tho&s;e which are more perfect till at la&s;t you may freely exhibit what|ever is promotive of piety or morals, and be only the more approved as the performances are more complete&mdash;But we mu&s;t now de&s;cribe the apparatus and manner of an exhibition.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION II. OF NECESSARY PREPARATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>IT is nece&s;&s;ary in your &s;choolhou&s;e, to have a &s;mall e&s;|planade, or &s;tage. If no one be made in the con&s;truction of the hou&s;e you may erect a temporary one. It will be very convenient to have a room behind the &s;tage, to which the performers can withdraw, when they &s;hould be &s;up|po&s;ed ab&s;ent. About this &s;tage, on a frame erected for the purpo&s;e, you may draw curtains, to conceal the &s;tage, oc|ca&s;ionally&punc; from the audience. This will give opportunity to repre&s;ent different &s;cenes of action. Then by tables, books, &amp;c. the &s;tage may repre&s;ent a &s;tudy&mdash;by national arms, and emblems &amp;c. a court&mdash;by military trophies, an encampment or field of war&mdash;by means of &s;hackles, chains &amp;c. a pri&s;on&mdash;by hand&s;ome furniture, a gentleman's parlor&mdash;by cheap furniture, of the rural kind, a cottage or &s;hepherd's tent &amp;c. Thus on a &s;tage of no more than twelve feet by eight&mdash;by &s;uch judicious alterations, ef|fects may be produced on the imagination, which are truly &s;urprizing, if we con&s;ider the cau&s;e, and it may be done without any extraordinary expen&s;e.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide the curtains which are drawn around the &s;tage, there &s;hould be one drawn acro&s;s from &s;ide to &s;ide, which may totally hide the back-&s;cene, and be &s;o contrived, as to open at the end, and in the middle. Per&s;ons engaged in oppo&s;ite parties, &s;entiments, or intere&s;ts, or who are any way at variance, &s;hould enter on oppo&s;ite &s;ides of the &s;tage. If during the repre&s;entations they be not reconciled they &s;hould al&s;o depart on oppo&s;ite &s;ides, if they become friends they &s;hould go off on the &s;ame &s;ide &amp;c. while the others are performing; they, who are to follow, mu&s;t remain concealed behind the back curtain, if there be no drawing
<PB N="11" REF="034600_0008_0FFF13F3A0DA4F10">
room behind. If there be a drawing room behind, that is properly the place for the performers who are waiting&mdash; the curtain opens in the middle to receive &s;ome grand or augu&s;t character&mdash;Or opening into another room, it may repre&s;ent objects at a di&s;tance&mdash;Or it may repre&s;ent an action which is &s;een from one room into another. As in the "<HI>Orphan of China,</HI>" the opening of the curtain in the middle, and the ladies clo&s;ing the door by &s;tanding clo&s;e together, while the children, threatened to be kil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed by the Tartars, are behind them, produces a &s;triking effect on the imagination and feelings of the audience. And this back curtain will be found of great u&s;e in all repre&s;entations of the dramatic kind&mdash;Such an appara<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s as this will co&s;t lit|tle or nothing, and will be found &s;ufficient for any thing which can be well repre&s;ented by the boys and girls of a &s;chool. Being thus furni&s;hed with a &s;tage, next it mu&s;t be our care to furni&s;h the &s;tage with performers. Ma&s;ks, dre&s;&s;es arms, emblems, profe&s;&s;ional implements, may ea&s;ily and occa&s;ionally be procured, as they may be of u&s;e, by bor|rowing them of the owners.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION III. OF SELECTING THE PERFORMERS.</HEAD>
<P>IT &s;hould be a capital maxim in &s;electing the per&s;ons to perform, that they be heartily willing for the enterprize and de&s;irous of di&s;tingui&s;hing them&s;elves &mdash;Unle&s;s your &s;uperiors or employers require, never take any per&s;on who expre&s;&s;es reluctance to be a &s;peaker. Such will never perform well. And be a&s;&s;ured that the parents or guar|dians of each &s;tudent, approve of his being in&s;tructed in rhetoric, before you be&s;tow your pains upon him. By the&s;e precautions you will not only avoid blame; but e&s;|cape a derangement of your exhibition after it is formed.</P>
<P>You will al&s;o have a &s;et of lively, animated acto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&mdash;and have them perfectly at your own command&mdash;advi&s;e the be&s;t &s;peakers to undertake parts, but compel none&mdash;advi&s;e, if you fear having too many, the poorer &s;peakers not to take parts&mdash;but if they be greatly de&s;irous, accept them. And let them begin with the &s;horter parts, and tho&s;e which require the lea&s;t &s;kill in &s;peaking&mdash;And it may be que&s;|tioned
<PB N="12" REF="034600_0009_0FFF13B999D232F0">
whether an exhibition appears &s;o well, to have all the parts uniformly executed according to the &s;trict rules of good &s;peaking; as it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to have the principal parts, exceedingly well performed, and the under parts with le&s;s &s;kill&mdash;Cicero ob&s;erves that the Greek players who had un|der parts purpo&s;ely fell &s;hort in &s;ome degree, of what they could perform, that the principal parts might appear to greater advantage&mdash;The le&s;s able &s;peakers may not be u&s;ele&s;s to you.</P>
<P>In this fir&s;t &s;election by the&s;e means you will have a lively &s;pirited corps of volunteers for your exhibition&mdash; and you will have no guardian or parent blaming you for compelling his boys or girls to &s;peak again&s;t their wills and expo&s;ing their weakne&s;s, in ca&s;e they &s;hould be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;uc|ce&s;sful.</P>
<P>Before you di&s;tribute the parts other points are to be con&s;idered&mdash;It mu&s;t not be thought that you intend to mark the foibles or vices of any of your performers in pub|lic. Should you a&s;&s;ign the part of a clown, to a per&s;on nat|urally clum&s;y and awkward, he, and his parents, might think you meant it as a &s;tigma upon him, or the family. Should you a&s;&s;ign the part of a rogue, to a boy who is known to be &s;uch a character; it will give offence. And neither of the parts would be performed well; thro an un|ea&s;y con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s which would attend the performance. If you would e&s;cape the unea&s;ine&s;s of relations or di&s;content in your &s;chool, all a&s;&s;ignments which would carry a pointed reflection on individuals or families mu&s;t be avoided&mdash;And there are certain principles which may help you out of all difficulty.</P>

From which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> he will &s;trike it off in a lively manner, and feel no kind of fear le&s;t it &s;hould be applied to him&s;elf&mdash;Al&s;o a per&s;on who when he plea&s;es can behave very gentcelly, yet

<P>But, as to grave and &s;erious characters being good, they mu&s;t be a&s;&s;igned to grave and &s;erious per&s;ons&mdash;Merry or cheerful characters to per&s;ons of the &s;ame ca&s;t. A gen|eral is ill per&s;onated by a palefaced boy&mdash;He &s;hould be a large man and a noble figure&mdash;A magi&s;trate the &s;ame, when he appears in his proper character&mdash;A Lady of em|inence &s;hould be repre&s;ented by one tall, well proportion|ed, and pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">onable&mdash;And it would be mo&s;t ab&s;urd to repre|&s;ent a &s;hepherde&s;s the Venus of the groves but by a girl who is beautiful in reality.</P>
<P>And it may not be ami&s;s in many ca&s;es to let the &s;chol|ars chu&s;e the parts for them&s;elves or draw them out by lot in ca&s;e there is like to be a competition&mdash;And it may be &s;ettled al&s;o as a principle after the parts are a&s;&s;igned that any who plea&s;e may change between them&s;elves, if both may thereby be &s;uited better. And to conclude this &s;ection in a few words&mdash;Endeavor to de&s;ignate your per|formers in &s;uch a manner as to have them ea&s;y and &s;ati&s;|fied, and if po&s;&s;ible let none of their friends be di&s;content|ed&mdash;For it is often from the re&s;entment of per&s;ons who think them&s;elves hurt; that clamors have been rai&s;ed again&s;t the &s;tudy of rhetoric, which is by good judges tho't a nece&s;&s;ary part of education <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> a free &s;tate.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IV. OF DISTRIBUTING THE PARTS.</HEAD>
<P>FOR the principal character in each piece you will doubtle&s;s &s;elect a &s;peaker on whom you can depend for &s;teadine&s;s of temper, and complete &s;elf command&mdash;You
<PB N="14" REF="034600_0011_0FFF13BB5F660660">
will do the &s;ame for any per&s;ons who will perform the &s;ingle pieces. If you have a &s;ingle piece to begin your exhibition, let it be given to a per&s;on of great firmne&s;s. For complete coolne&s;s, and &s;elfcommand, are in no part of an exhibition, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary as in the fir&s;t piece that is &s;poken. The fir&s;t piece, &s;poken well, gives &s;uch a &s;pring to the &s;pirits of the performers who are to follow; as will carry with it the mo&s;t happy effects, thro the whole exhi|bition&mdash;And in fact the fir&s;t performance is the mo&s;t dif|ficult and mo&s;t trying to the feelings of the performer. If it &s;hould fail it will &s;ink the &s;pirits of the other performers, and probably &s;poil the whole exhibition. For performing the la&s;t piece which &s;hould be a &s;ingle one, and an epi|logue to the whole, you &s;hould have that &s;peaker in your &s;chool, who has the mo&s;t &s;weet and harmonious voice, with the mo&s;t ea&s;y and gentle manners, and in every view the mo&s;t plea&s;ing &s;peaker. For this part &s;hould make the audience feel inten&s;ely, and as it was &s;aid of Pericles the Orator, &s;hould leave the &s;ting of plea&s;ure in the hearts of the hearers. If you have an intermediate &s;ingle piece, any good and clear &s;peaker may have it and we &s;hall &s;how hereafter of what advantage &s;uch a piece may be&mdash;The re&s;t of the parts may be di&s;po&s;ed of according to your di&s;cret|ion.

<P>BEING &s;tored with &s;ingle pieces, dialogues, dramas, and all legitimate materials of an exhibition&mdash;nothing pro|fane or indecent being admitted&mdash;having al&s;o dige&s;ted righteous principles of a&s;&s;igning parts in your mind and compleated that difficult work; it now remains, to arrange tho&s;e parts &s;o, as to con&s;titute an agreeable whole&mdash;the fir&s;t thing is to determine how many &s;ingle pieces you will have.

<P>Three &s;ingle pieces &s;eem then to be the number mo&s;t convenient, and we &s;hall call them the prologue, the inter|mediate, and the epilogue.&mdash;Very much of the eclat of an exhibition depends on the&s;e&mdash;we &s;hall therefore de&s;cribe them in their order with the parts which &s;hould come be|tween them.</P>
<P N="1">1. The PROLOGUE or introductory piece &s;hould al|ways be a&s;&s;umed from &s;ome topic which is calculated to waken the tender feelings of the audience, and di&s;po&s;e them to candor&mdash;the tender &s;en&s;ibility of youth, their de|&s;ire to plea&s;e, their expectations of kindne&s;s from their par|ents and friends, are &s;uitable ideas for a <HI>prologue.</HI> And the&s;e may be mixed with any other which may prepare the au|dience to receive the exhibition kindly&mdash;It &s;hould be &s;pok|en generally in a rather low pitch of the voice and with the air of diffidence, expre&s;&s;ive of the mode&s;ty of the &s;tudents and the re&s;pect which they feel for the audience.
<PB N="17" REF="034600_0014_0FFF13FB46884590">
Nothing is more ab&s;urd than blu&s;tering, and towering rhetoric in a prologue.</P>
<P>If there be any &s;erious bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;chool, &s;uch as ex|amination of &s;cholars in reading, philo&s;ophy, or any branch of &s;cience, it be&s;t comes in immediately after the prologue, and while the attention of the audience is not yet fatigued. But if every thing of this kind has been tran&s;acted before;-let the mo&s;t &s;erious and &s;ublime pieces follow the prologue. While the attention is not yet fatigued the &s;erious and the &s;ublime &s;trike the mind with much the greate&s;t advantage. Matters which are weighty and apply to the judgment, are ill introduced after the mind is already overcharged. They cannot be received with the approbation they de|&s;erve, and con&s;equently will be thought to be dull, and in&s;ipid.</P>
<P>It is a mi&s;take to &s;uppo&s;e an audience will not reli&s;h &s;eri|ous matter&mdash;Variety is plea&s;ing to the human mind; and that exhibition will plea&s;e mo&s;t, which has &s;ome pieces &s;e|rious, &s;ome highly argumentative and rational, &s;ome pa|thetic, &s;ome merely intere&s;ting, &s;ome highly diverting.&mdash; But mo&s;t exhibitors err in forever aiming to excite a laugh. They are often un&s;ucce&s;sful, and then it occa&s;ions di&s;gu&s;t. &mdash;And they are in danger of making the whole a &s;cene of low buffoonery.</P>
<P>When the dialogi&s;ts have tran&s;acted all matters of the mo&s;t &s;erious and &s;olid kind, it will be be&s;t to vary the ex|erci&s;es, and bring in the</P>
<P N="2">2. INTERMEDIATE&mdash;a &s;ingle piece, taken from any top|ic which is amu&s;ing. It &s;hould be a piece which requires no great attention of the mind to under&s;tand it; and it ought not by any means to be pathetic or &s;ublime; but &s;ome pretty &s;peech, which &s;hall relieve the attention, and give the mind opportunity to recruit it&s;elf for the Dramas which are to follow. The fable of the Two Ladies, the Flori&s;t and the Bear, is a good example. The character|i&s;tic of this part is that it entertains the mind without fa|tiguing it, and leaves all the &s;tronger pa&s;&s;ions unengaged for the pathetic &s;cenes which are to follow. Next after the intermediate &s;hould come in the mo&s;t intere&s;ting and pa&s;|&s;ionate pieces which you have to exhibit. The&s;e will take le&s;s, if exhibited after the audience have been rai&s;ed to a high pitch of mirth. Then to conclude the dialogi&s;tic rep|re&s;entation,

<P N="3">3. EPILOGUE or concluding part. This part will con|tain many intere&s;ting matters; compliments to the audi|ence, for their candor and attention; thanks to the parents and guardians for affording the means of in&s;truction; ad|dre&s;&s;es to amicable and parental affections; &s;chool mates taking leave of each other, &amp;c.&mdash;And indeed polite and genteel addre&s;s and compliments to &s;everal parts of the a&s;|&s;embly, will make the varied &s;ub&s;tance of this part. A well written Epilogue, in which all the ornament and pomp of ver&s;e may be &s;hown, all the graces of the mo&s;t refined elocution &s;hould be di&s;played, pronounced in a mixt &s;chool by &s;ome elegant young lady, will give &s;uch a fini&s;hing &s;troke to the whole, as to leave the audience little power or will to critici&s;e upon the performances. And they mu&s;t go away pronouncing it a good exhibition. If they find their feelings are not &s;hocked, or their rea&s;on affronted, but with the entertainment they have received good prin|ciples, which remain fixed in their memories, they will not long be enemies to exhibitions.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VI. OF THE LENGTH AND QUANTITY OF AN EX|HIBITION.</HEAD>
<P>THE time of an exhibition ought not to exceed four hours and half, or at the mo&s;t five hours. Lengthy enter|tainments, where the audience are &s;o confined, will nece&s;&s;|arily grow tire&s;ome: and the be&s;t pieces, after the hear|ers are tired, make no favorable impre&s;&s;ion.

<HEAD>SECTION VII. REMARKS ON ATTITUDES, GESTURES &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t thing nece&s;&s;ary for a per&s;on performing well is, that which is nece&s;&s;ary to all polite behavior in gen|teel companies. It is to enter an audience or company in an ea&s;y and graceful manner, and leave it in the &s;ame &s;tile. The gentleman or lady who is to perform, mu&s;t be able to enter without trembling and extreme agitation&mdash;with a &s;teady countenance, &s;uited to the part to be performed&mdash; and mu&s;t do the honors of entrance, in a bow or courte&s;y, in an ea&s;y and elegant manner, whenever that is required. &mdash;And even in burle&s;que or pa&s;&s;ionate parts, the entrance or exit mu&s;t be &s;uited to and entirely governed by the part to which it belongs.</P>
<P>To bring your &s;cholars to act thus ea&s;ily and genteely, attend fir&s;t to the neatne&s;s of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">heir per&s;ons. See that they be cleanly, and neat in their dre&s;s, that they be well wa&s;hed and combed every day. This done will give them genteel feelings, which will expre&s;s them&s;elves in genteel airs. Allow no &s;cholar to affect oddity or to dre&s;s in an ab&s;urd, and uncouth manner. U&s;e them to decent and hand&s;ome po&s;itions in reading&mdash;correct them if they hang their heads down on their bo&s;oms or on one &s;ide, if they &s;toop forward or &s;trut back immoderately. Suffer them not to lounge and loll about, to di&s;tort their faces, or limbs, to roll their eyes about, or make any awkward or di&s;agreeable motion, with them.</P>
<P>In&s;truct them how to come into a room and how to go out&mdash;Let a young gentleman always &s;tand firmly on his feet to make a bow, and learn to bring up his feet to a firm po&s;ition&mdash;without appearing to de&s;ign it&mdash;When a man beings up his right foot &s;o that the heel of it &s;hall be two or three inches di&s;tant from the buckle or &s;hoetye of the left, he &s;tands in a good po&s;ition to make a bow&mdash;He &s;hould take off his hat, rai&s;ing his hand to his head in a &s;piral line &mdash;not catching it off, in a direct line, either &s;ideways, or before. He &s;hould bend his body not in one point only, but its flexture &s;hould begin from the neck and proceed from thence gradually downward&mdash;And a bow to expre&s;s rev|erence,

However it mu&s;t be varied according to the greater or le&s;s degree of re&s;pect to be expre&s;&s;ed by it&mdash;There &s;hould be no to&s;s of the head, no hitch, or jerk in making a bow. But the motion of it, &s;hould always be &s;mooth and ea&s;y both in falling and rai&s;ing of the body&mdash;The hat &s;hould be put on with the hand mo|ving in a &s;piral line, as in taking it off&mdash;and in taking off the hat, and putting it on, you &s;hould never bring your hat between your face, and the face of the per&s;on to whom your &s;peech is directed&mdash;The arms &s;hould, in entering a room, hang ea&s;y by the &s;ides, neither extended in any direction nor hanging exactly parallel to the &s;ides of the body.</P>
<P>A young Lady &s;hould in general enter a room with a &s;teady mode&s;t countenance. She &s;hould bring up her feet to a firm po&s;ition to make a courte&s;y. Perhaps as good a one for general u&s;e as any is to have the heel of the left foot at a moderate di&s;tance from the &s;hoetye of the right, and govern her motions with her right foot; or if a lady does not find this ea&s;y, let her take the rever&s;e, or any po&s;ition in which &s;he can &s;tand firm to command her motions, and her figure not be ungraceful&mdash;It is very graceful to bring her clothes forward by a &s;mall almo&s;t imperceptible motion, &s;o as to hide the flexure of her limbs, before &s;he lets her&s;elf down&mdash; Then &s;he &s;hould appear to &s;ink with an ea&s;y motion, as low as intended, and if &s;he can add a very &s;mall motion, as if withdrawing thro mode&s;ty from the object to which &s;he addre&s;&s;es her&s;elf, it will make her appear very graceful. She &s;hould with an ea&s;y motion, ri&s;e to her natural mode of &s;tanding&mdash;Here let it be ob&s;erved that her arms &s;hould not be folded on her lap; but hang in an ea&s;y manner, at the &s;ides. And the withdrawing motion, &s;hould be very &s;mall, in all in&s;tances. And by per&s;ons who naturally &s;toop forward it had better be wholly omitted. Nay it had bet|ter be omitted by all who cannot perform it gracefully.</P>
<P>If your &s;cholars have had the advantage of a good dancing &s;chool, it will &s;ave you much attention to the&s;e matters&mdash;but if they have had no in&s;truction of this kind, it mu&s;t be given, or you never will have a good exhibition.</P>
<P>The main difficulty is to get a &s;cholar into the habit of entering into and going out of a room with perfect com|po&s;ure and ea&s;e of mind. For this end it will be u&s;eful to
<PB N="21" REF="034600_0018_0FFF1401130DA3C8">
let your &s;cholars, taking their turns, go out of the &s;chool room, &s;peaking &s;omething to the &s;tudent, as "ladies, or gentlemen," (as the ca&s;e may be) "we wi&s;h you a happy day" or in entering&mdash; &s;aying "gentlemen or ladies I am very happy to &s;ee you" or any other civil &s;entence or phra&s;e&mdash; this &s;hould be done while they are con&s;cious of being ob&s;erved by the &s;chool. And when they are able to do this compo&s;edly, you will &s;oon find them able to per|form any thing with compo&s;ure, which you can wi&s;h them to perform.</P>
<P>For the movements of the hands, &amp;c. &amp;c. and how the pa&s;&s;ions are expre&s;&s;ed&mdash; you may look into any of the com|mon books on this &s;ubject. The "Art of Speaking" &s;ays as much on that head&punc; as is u&s;eful, and even more. As to the expre&s;&s;ion of the pa&s;&s;ions in the countenance, the <HI>Plate of the pa&s;&s;ions</HI> in the Engli&s;h "Preceptor;" or in <HI>Hogarth's "Analy&s;is of Beauty,</HI>" will teach more than all the written precepts in the world.</P>
<P>But the rhetoric of young ladies &s;hould be &s;uitable to their &s;ex. It &s;hould never be violent. A lady &s;hould never extend her arms at full length, or &s;trike her bo&s;om with her hands, or rai&s;e her hand aloft, above her head &mdash; a lady in any violent pa&s;&s;ion &s;hould not give it full vent; but appear to be endeavoring to &s;uppre&s;s it.&mdash;And never even till death &s;hould lo&s;e her care for decency&mdash;And a lady &s;hould never addre&s;s an a&s;&s;embly at large; but may &s;peak to her parents, her guardian, her &s;chool mates, &amp;c. And of all things a lady &s;hould never addre&s;s her&s;elf to the young men. It &s;hould always be con&s;idered that a young lady in a &s;chool is not actre&s;s but merely a &s;cholar. Her object is learning. She &s;hould behave exactly as we might rationally &s;uppo&s;e a genteel lady would behave in &s;uch a &s;ituation&mdash;except only in burle&s;que parts, and in them no lady &s;hould tre&s;pa&s;s upon decency.</P>
<P>All the performers in dialogues &s;hould appear to ad|dre&s;s each other, and to take no kind of notice of the audi|ence, unle&s;s the parts they are performing requires it &mdash;The performers &s;hould move about on the &s;tage as the action of the piece requires &mdash;neither &s;hould they &s;tand toe to toe like boxers, nor &s;hould they move but with rea&s;on, and to heighten the effect of the piece.</P>
<P>As much of ge&s;ture as can be applied with rea&s;on; as much motion on the &s;tage, as is proper and natural, &s;hould
<PB N="22" REF="034600_0019_0FFF13C849AA9FE8">
be u&s;ed. It makes the pieces lively, and is very intere&s;ting to the audience&mdash;But more &s;hould not by any means be admitted.</P>
<P>It is foreign to the purpo&s;e of a &s;chool to overload exhi|bitions with mu&s;ic and adventitious ornaments; they cover the faults of a bad exhibition but &s;poil a good one by drawing off the attention of the audience from the &s;peaking and manners of the &s;tudents to other objects&mdash;the elocu|tion and polite behavior of the &s;tudents are the grand points to be regarded &mdash;yet a few mu&s;ical pieces may be admmitted if properly applied.</P>
<P>In their behavior the young ladies &s;hould be guarded from mincing fidgetry and all &s;illy coquetti&s;h airs; &s;hould u&s;e no affected graces, nor &s;hould they be allowed to u&s;e any familiarity with the young men, which might offend the nice&s;t ta&s;te.</P>
<P>The young gentlemen &s;hould behave properly to the ladies, treat them re&s;pectfully and offer them no rude or even familiar behavior, &s;o as in the lea&s;t to offend per&s;ons of delicacy&mdash;A young gentleman acting a rational part &s;hould always addre&s;s a lady &s;tanding at her left hand, and bearing his weight on the foot next to her, to give him&s;elf the air of tenderne&s;s and re&s;pect&mdash;A young gentleman may ki&s;s the hand of a lady in token of re&s;pect; or he may &s;upport her with her arm. But proper amorous ki&s;&s;ing, embracing, are things which nature never meant to be ex|hibited in public.</P>
<P>And tho the practice of modern theatres may be otherwi&s;e, it is a rule given by Horace in his "Art of Poetry," that no &s;avage murders or peculiarly &s;hocking barbarities be rep|re&s;ented on the &s;tage&mdash;Every thing of that kind if &s;uppo&s;ed at all &s;hould be imagined to be done at a di&s;tance.</P>
<P>The dre&s;&s;es &s;hould be &s;uited to the character, but they need not be expen&s;ive. A &s;imple wreath of laurel may de|note a conqueror, a diadem a monarch; his badge of of|fice any magi&s;trate.

As to entrances and exits, practi&s;e your &s;cholars to go in turns and make their exit and entrance under the ob&s;ervance of the &s;chool, till, on the perform|ance, the looks of the &s;chool te&s;tify approbation&mdash;For if there be the lea&s;t awkwardne&s;s, tho&s;e who are ob&s;ervers will perceive it, and it will affect them very &s;trongly&mdash;Tho they mean to be extremely kind to one another, they will not be able to &s;uppre&s;s a laugh. But when all are come to the point that they perform pa&s;&s;ably, they will mutu|ally &s;how their approbation in their countenance&mdash;The like may be &s;aid of ge&s;ture. When one part of the &s;chool are &s;pectators and the other part performers, tho&s;e ge&s;tures which affect the &s;pectators agreeably, are with very few exceptions good. Tho&s;e which affect them di&s;agreea|bly, bad&mdash;The principles of the&s;e affections are properly natural.</P>
<P>IT is generally be&s;t, if your &s;chool be large, to divide it, and not always have the whole &s;chool together at rehear|&s;als. And e&s;pecially, if you, to &s;ave the time of your &s;cholars and prevent the &s;tudy of rhetoric from intruding on other &s;tudies, have your rehear&s;als in the evening; it will be be&s;t to divide the &s;chool, that the &s;cholars may not be kept out too late in the evening and incur cen&s;ure on that account.</P>
<P>In your rehear&s;als, correct all fal&s;e pronunciation fir&s;t. Make them recite and pronounce the pieces well. Then add gradually the graces of motion, and corporal ge&s;ture. And when you find that while one party of your &s;cholars is performing, the re&s;t who make a little audience are prop|erly affected&mdash;you have obtained your aim. If the gen|teel &s;cenes produce &s;trong expre&s;&s;ions of approbation&mdash;if the ridiculous parts readily and promptly excite laughter&mdash; if the pathetic ones bring tears into the eyes of the audit|ors;
<PB N="24" REF="034600_0021_0FFF13CAB1A80558">
then your pieces are ripe for exhibition. And to de|lay it longer would be to let the ardor of your &s;cholars abate; and, con&s;equently, to lo&s;e in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the life of your exhibition.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IX. OF THE BENEFIT OF SCHOOL EXHIBITIONS.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN &s;chool exhibitions are regulated by rea&s;on, di|ve&s;ted of extreme expen&s;e, and conducted with propriety they are of very great u&s;e&mdash; they awaken the ambition of &s;tudents, and they become de&s;irous of behaving in a ration|al manner. We &s;uppo&s;e in &s;aying this, that the parts they

have performed be &s;uch as rea&s;on and religion do not di&s;approve. That they are replete with good &s;entiments, and promotive of good morals. It has often been ob&s;erved, that where there have been in the &s;ame town, &s;chools on the &s;ame footing in other re&s;pects, yet &s;ome have had exhibitions and others not, that the &s;chools in which there have been exhibitions, have not only excelled in the point of exhibit|ions but in every other. The rude&s;t nymphs or &s;wains by practi&s;ing on rhetoric will &s;oon acquire polite manners, for they will often per&s;onate the mo&s;t polite characters. And tho the &s;urly maje&s;ty of &s;ome male de&s;pots among us, may envy the graces of rhetoric to women, becau&s;e they find them&s;elves already outdone by women in every other ex|cellence; yet it is certain, that a clear, genteel manner of expre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves, is a va&s;t advantage to women, in forming that important alliance, which is to la&s;t for life.&mdash;And in the marriage &s;tate the mother who has been taught to read and &s;peak with propriety&punc; will be of un&s;peak|able advantage to her children in forming their elocution in early life. And we know that bad habits formed in childhood, &s;tick to many gentlemen of the court the pulpit, and the bar&punc; all their lives. Let &s;chool exhibitions con&s;i&s;t of laudable materials, and be managed with prudence, they will be of great advantage to both &s;exes, and form for all hearers an u&s;eful and in&s;tructive entertainment.</P>

<HEAD>Preface to the Dialogues.</HEAD>
<P>IN the following dialogues the author has aimed to ex|emplify the principal virtues and vices of human beings, &s;ome times a moral principle, is be&s;t repre&s;ented affir|matively; the principle &s;tated and the example given. An in&s;tance of this kind you have in <HI>Lucy,</HI> the principal charac|ter in the fir&s;t Dialogue&mdash;Here the principle is &s;et forth, directly in an example of virtue&mdash;Sometimes the nece&s;&s;ity of a virtue is &s;hown, by the embarra&s;&s;ments attending the oppo&s;ite vice&mdash;As in the character of Fieldfare in the Foundling, or of Ame&s;a in Scanderbeg&mdash;This re&s;embles the <HI>Reductio ad ab&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rdum</HI> &s;o familiarly known in Logic and Mathematics&mdash;The Author thinks that neither of the&s;e procedures can be objected to on ju&s;t principles, for we may practice virtue directly on its own principles, or may &s;et our&s;elves right by avoiding that which is wrong.</P>
<P>It may po&s;&s;ibly be objected, that &s;ome of the characters are too high charged and exceed any thing found in real life&mdash;The character of <HI>Nelly</HI> in the "Mother of a Family," and of <HI>Butterford</HI> in "The Maid of the groves," and of <HI>Puffpa&s;te</HI> in the 'Founding,' if any, will be tho't of this kind &mdash; But the author had his rea&s;ons for this &s;eeming exce&s;s. In the character of <HI>Nelly</HI> he would repre&s;ent the prodigious di&s;advantage, under which even a woman of a good mind may appear, totally de&s;titute of proper education&mdash;In that of Butterford he would &s;how how extremely di&s;agreeable a man of fortune is, void of virtue and good breeding&mdash;In the character of Puffpa&s;te he would &s;how that an hone&s;t well meaning man, will, notwith&s;tanding the utmo&s;t di&s;ad|vantages, with re&s;pect to external appearances, have &s;ome|thing entertaining and agreeable about him, and will in fact appear &s;uperior to a man of the greate&s;t refinement of education who yet neglects virtue&mdash;The&s;e characters are &s;o exaggerated that young per&s;ons, who are always want|ing in experience, may the better di&s;cern the intention of them.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="034600_0025_0FFF13CC96442260">It may be &s;aid that &s;ome of the pieces cannot pretend to originality&mdash;That there is a re&s;emblance between "The Triumph of Temper" and Shake&s;pear's "Taming of the Shrew;" between the "Father of a Family&mdash;and the "Pere de Famille" of Diederot. That the "Little Box" is partly taken from the "Ci&s;tellaria" and partly from the "Poenus" of Plautus&mdash;That the "Captive" &s;avours &s;trongly of the "Capteivi of the la&s;t mentioned author. That the "Or|phan of China" has been better dramatized by Voltaire and Dr. Murphy. That the "Di&s;contented" wife, is but the enlargement of the "UxorMemp&s;igamos" of Era&s;mus. The author will deny nothing of this; but &s;ay that he has given tho&s;e pieces a ca&s;t better fitted for &s;chools than their originals, and they are &s;o far new that he believes that there is not a corre&s;pondent page between his book and any other book now in print.</P>
<P>Should the critics of the age make any remarks upon this; or any of the author's works, he means to profit by it&mdash;He will be ready if his work &s;hould outlive the pre&s;ent edition to alter any &s;entiments, word, or phra&s;e, that proves to be wrong, as his aim is to gain e&s;teem, if he gains it at all, by fair means&mdash;and he would do as much good as he is able in the &s;hort &s;pace of life allotted to man&mdash;Wi&s;hing, he confe&s;&s;es, for &s;ome degree of approbation for wellmean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> endeavors, he re&s;igns him&s;elf to the candid and impartial public.</P>

Why all the&s;e hints at Alonzo? Have I a tenderne&s;s for him? Let me examine my own heart. It never yet deceived me. I admire his virtues. So does every one be&s;ide. Is the whole nation in love? I think his ad|dre&s;s is elegant. So do all others. I rejoice in his &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es. They are u&s;eful to the public. His attentions plea&s;e me. So they plea&s;e my aunt, old, and grave as &s;he is. His ab&s;ence makes me unea&s;y&mdash;Is this owing to tenderne&s;s? No&mdash;He is valuable to the nation: and it is a pity that &s;o fine a youth &s;hould be lo&s;t. So, Maria, this heart is &s;ound yet, and I am glad of that.

<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have often wondered that a man of your genius &s;hould not wi&s;h to marry. You Bachelors form wild ideas of dome&s;tic life.</P>

<P>It gives ju&s;t as much &s;en&s;e of confinement as the &s;oul has in being confined to the body&mdash;or as a man has in having an e&s;tate of <HI>his own,</HI> or living in a hou&s;e, or on a farm, of his own.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Field.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, but a wretched dependent.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, &s;uch is exactly the freedom which a man en|joys who refu&s;es marriage, except that it is neither &s;o in|nocent, nor &s;o reputable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Field.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you think the acqui&s;ition of valuable prop|erty makes no man the le&s;s free.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Much le&s;s does the acqui&s;ition of valuable friends. All that liberty is worth is that we may gain &s;uch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and &s;erve them; but the evil of want of principle, is great. It hurts many per&s;ons who ought to be happy.</P>
</SP>

<P>MY dear Lucinda, what a happy girl you are, your company is de&s;ired by all people old and young&mdash; and every per&s;on &s;peaks of you with plea&s;ure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am &s;orry for that, the view of too many will be directed to me&mdash;It would co&s;t me much trouble&mdash;I ever tho't it an unhappine&s;s to be too much the object of ad|miration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lem.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, how can any per&s;on be loved and admired too much? I &s;hould like to be admired by every body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your ambition then mu&s;t de&s;cend very low &s;ome|times.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lem.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did not mean exactly &s;o neither. But there is a certain cla&s;s whom I &s;hould wi&s;h to be in raptures with me, whenever they &s;aw me&mdash;I &s;hould not care much about old people.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>There you differ from me &mdash; The &s;entiments of people who are not of our own age may be of great u&s;e to us. They can give us credit and a good name&mdash;But I doubt whether it is right to &s;eek the particular admiration of many per&s;ons of our own age at once.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lem.</SPEAKER>
<P>You, it &s;eems, are very &s;crupulous.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>Were the per&s;ons, from whom attention to young ladies might be expected, di&s;tributed among us all, there would &s;carcely be one apiece&mdash;Were it then po&s;&s;ible, I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e it unju&s;t, to engro&s;s a number. I had ra|ther enjoy the beneficial &s;ociety of one true friend, than be the dupe of twenty flatterers &mdash; To flatter a lady that is really de&s;erving, is very much like painting a diamond to make it &s;hine.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lem.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not very fond of flattery; but it may do
<PB N="234" REF="034600_0226_0FFF3442B1CBAE40">
when one can get nothing el&s;e. It is more plea&s;ing to hear good &s;en&s;e, or what we call good &s;en&s;e; but I had rather men would flatter me than &s;ay nothing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Luc.</SPEAKER>
<P>The whole bu&s;ine&s;s is commonly artificial. A man u&s;es flattery as mu&s;icians do the fa, &s;ol, la, me, of their gamut, to put their voices into tune. When one knows the artifice, it &s;oon becomes tire&s;ome. But tell me, my friend, if you be &s;o fond of admiration, by what means you have attempted to &s;ecure it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lem.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have in various ways tried to accompli&s;h my pur|po&s;e. They may all be reduced to one principle&mdash;that of doing things extraordinary But my friends &s;eem to be grow|ing more &amp; more indifferent to me every day&mdash;I &s;hould be glad, if by conver&s;ing with you I could &s;et my ideas right.</P>

<P>I am &s;orry that you have been &s;o much mortified. It mu&s;t be bitterne&s;s to a woman of &s;pirit. But before I give my &s;entiments, let me know the method you have hitherto practi&s;ed. The phy&s;ician always examines his pa|tient, before he pre&s;cribes a cure.</P>

<P>IT is generally very idle for people in the vicinity, to interpo&s;e in the quarrels of married per&s;ons.

<P>There was a young man, who courted a very in|du&s;trious girl&mdash;He di&s;liked her and left her, becau&s;e &s;he had a hard hand, and the ends of her fingers were rough by being pricked with a needle; and the mark of a thimble &s;poiled the beauty of one of her fingers&mdash;after he had left her he came to have his fortune told.</P>

<P>No, but he was then courting another, who&s;e hands were as &s;oft as pa&s;te&mdash;and there was not the lea&s;t mark of a needle, thimble, or any blemi&s;h to be &s;een on her hands.</P>
</SP>

<P>Could your ma&s;ter tell his fortune?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Yes, he told him that he would marry an idle wife who would di&s;&s;ipate his fortune. And it turned out ju&s;t &s;o, in every particular.</P>

<P>He is an extraordinary man&mdash;One more in&s;tance I will tell, which mu&s;t &s;urprize you&mdash;For, I a&s;&s;ure you, that bottle of my ma&s;ter's is brimful of wi&s;dom&mdash;A young lady of our village tru&s;ted a gentleman his mere word for the &s;ecurity of her reputation&mdash;She came to my ma&s;ter to tell her fortune&mdash;He told her that the wretch would nev|er marry her, and it turned out ju&s;t &s;o.</P>

<P>How under the heavens could he know that?</P>

<P>Well &s;ir, from certain circum&s;tances I judge that men are weaker than women, and have le&s;s under&s;tand|ing&mdash;are not all the whims and extravagances of learning invented by men&mdash;the ideal &s;y&s;tem&mdash;denial of providence, athei&s;m, or putting nature in&s;tead of God&punc; Mi&s;chance agen|cy, &s;ceptici&s;m concerning morals &amp;c. which have de|ranged &s;ociety and corrupted mankind.

We love more than plea&s;ure would dictate, we behold them with lively admiration, with the mo&s;t inten&s;e re&s;pect, we con&s;ider our happine&s;s as involved in theirs. Have you never heard of the Jewi&s;h tradition, that man, when fir&s;t formed was placed in a garden beautiful as Ely&s;ian fields; yet would not be content without the &s;ociety of a woman?

<P>Without &s;aying any thing of the actual truth of the&s;e tran&s;actions, they prove that the connection of the &s;exes on the principles of virtue is natural and inviolable, and that this has ever been the tho't of men&mdash;whatever a man gains by &s;tudy or labor, the &s;poils of war, and the profits of peace&mdash;the reward of genius, and ways of in|du&s;try&mdash;are bro't by him, and freely be&s;towed on his wife.

<P>Not &s;o well as with it I believe. The Chri&s;tians have a curious &s;y&s;tem, let it come from the Jews, or from any other nation.

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tha.</SPEAKER>
<P>By a fair compari&s;on of facts&mdash;You know that women have been abu&s;ed in various parts of the globe. The Chri&s;tians &s;ay this was predicted from the time that Eve &s;tole the forbidden apples of paradi&s;e. Except in Greece, which has always been the &s;eat of learning and politene&s;s; women have been &s;ubjected to the arbitrary di&s;po&s;al of the men.

</SP>

<SPEAKER>Arp.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are they more generous in their principles than our noble Romans?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Certainly, the noble&s;t of our Romans claim the right of arbitrary divorce and &s;ome of our mo&s;t celebrated characters have alienated their wives to &s;trangers. In Ger|many and other nothern nations they are treated as &s;laves and &s;ubjected to the &s;cource. In A&s;ia they are &s;old like common animals in the market.

ordinance previous to all human laws. That divorce can never be lawful; but in ca&s;e of manife&s;t infidelity.&mdash; That by marriage a man becomes one, with his wife, in heart, mind, and &s;oul.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Arp.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is a very happy doctrine; for there are one half of our Romans who treat their wives with le&s;s com|plai&s;ance than they would treat &s;trangers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tha.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is generally the ca&s;e with ignorant and fool|i&s;h people. But the Chri&s;tians teach, That he who loveth his wife, loveth him&s;elf; and that he &s;hould no more u&s;e her ill, than he would abu&s;e him&s;elf. That he &s;hould be willing to expo&s;e his life for her &s;ake, even as Chri&s;t died for his church. That he mu&s;t not give her pain not &s;o much, as by bitter, and reproachful words.</P>

<HEAD>ANECDOTES&mdash;LEADING TO THE UNDERSTAND|ING OF THE PIECE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ZENOBIA</HI> was Queen of <HI>Palmyra</HI> &mdash; a woman of high &s;pirit, bordering on pride. She was a per&s;on of mo&s;t &s;ub|lime morals, and fond of her hu&s;band to enthu&s;ia&s;m&mdash;yet ever declared her attachment was &s;olely founded on his virtues. She was remarkable for her maternal affection, and &s;en&s;e of gratitude. Her hu&s;band, peri&s;hing in the wars, left her kingdom in a very flouri&s;hing condition, which &s;he greatly &s;trengthened by an alliance with the Arabians and Per&s;ians. Becoming wealthy and pro&s;perous, &s;he declared her&s;elf Queen of the Ea&s;t, and defied the Roman power. The Emperor, after various efforts to gain her to the in|tere&s;ts of Rome, &s;ubdued her in war; led her in triumph in golden chains, and allowed her to re&s;ide a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> one of his vil|las at <HI>Tibur</HI> in <HI>Italy;</HI> where &s;oon &s;he died of grief and mortification. By the general te&s;timony of hi&s;torians, AURELIAN had no other cau&s;e for making war again&s;t her, but her pro&s;perity and grandeur; and by his conduct to her he brought an indelible &s;tain on his memory.</P>
<P><HI>LONGINUS,</HI> her prime mini&s;ter, was a per&s;on no le&s;s remarkable. Acquainted with &s;cience in general&mdash;Ver&s;ed in all the eminent Pagan and Chri&s;tian writers&mdash;An admir|er of Mo&s;es and St. Paul.

<Q><L>Thee, bold Longinus, all the Nine in&s;pire;</L>

<L>His own example &s;trengthens all his laws;</L>
<L>And is, him&s;elf, the great Sublime he draws.</L></Q></P>

<HEAD>Preface TO THE SINGLE PIECES.</HEAD>
<P>THE Editor of this work, having always found it to be one of the mo&s;t difficult things attending an exhibition, to obtain &s;uitable occa&s;ional pieces; whether for the in|troduction, intermediate &s;peech, or conclu&s;ion; thought it be&s;t to in&s;ert in his book a number of the&s;e kinds&mdash;Indeed he publi&s;hes all that he can collect, at pre&s;ent, of tho&s;e which he has u&s;ed.</P>
<P>It is as much impo&s;&s;ible to avoid a &s;amene&s;s in the in|troductory and concluding pieces, as in ordination or elec|tion &s;ermons, or commencement orations&mdash;the intermedi|ates are not liable to this inconvenience. They may be varied without end&mdash;but only one or two of the prologues, or epilogues are u&s;ed in a year, the &s;amene&s;s may only ap|pear as they &s;tand in the book, and not in the public u&s;e of them.</P>
<P>He has al&s;o tho't proper to publi&s;h the names of the &s;tudents to whom &s;ingle pieces have been a&s;&s;igned, becau&s;e it would be doing them honor, as none can perform them but &s;uch as are, in many re&s;pects, good &s;cholars&mdash;and none but tho&s;e of unblemi&s;hed moral character can have them. The in&s;ertion of their names does homage to their genius, improvements, and virtue; and may give them a degree of celebrity, which one day or another may be of u&s;e to them. It may al&s;o excite ambition of &s;ucceeding &s;tudents, who&s;e performances <HI>may</HI> be publi&s;hed in a &s;econd volume.</P>
<P>There will be a &s;eeming inequality among the pieces here given&mdash;but both &s;ingle and dramatic compo&s;itions appear differently, publicly performed, from what they do when read in &s;ilence&mdash;If any do not &s;trike the reader much in private, let him con&s;ider, that public repre&s;enta|tion is the only te&s;t of their merit.</P>
<P><PB N="480" REF="034600_0469_0FFF36039A8B2698">The Editor has taken great gains, and even gained the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of ladies of learning and approved character, to clear his pieces of all offen&s;ive words and pa&s;&s;ages&mdash;yet if one word or pa&s;&s;age of this kind &s;hall remain after all, he di&s;avows it&mdash;and de&s;ires every one who &s;hall make u&s;e of his book; to render delicate any pa&s;&s;age that offends, as in &s;o doing he will fulfil the intention of the publi&s;her.</P>

<L>Great Sophocles, &s;killed in poetic art,</L>

<L>Determined on a &s;udden, &s;ure relief.</L>

<L>And &s;ung in ver&s;e divine the POWER OF LOVE.</L>

<P>There is a plea&s;ure in this idea, that we have an oppor|tunity to recommend our&s;elves to you; and this plea&s;ure in good degree takes away the &s;en&s;e of fear. How happy &s;hall we be, to hear you &s;ay hereafter, that your children are le&s;s a burden than a plea&s;ure to you; and that you have been the happier, by &s;uch ble&s;&s;ings&mdash;as many would willingly refu&s;e.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>RESPECTABLE GENTLEMEN, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Addre&s;&s;ed to the vi&s;itors of the &s;chool.</NOTE></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is not unknown to you, how much wit has been &s;cat|tered on the &s;ubject of the loquacity of women&mdash;and how
<PB N="499" REF="034600_0488_0FFF36510534BF98">
much &s;atire expended in ridiculing ladies who have a ta&s;te for learning&mdash;but if an eminent faculty of &s;peech be po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by women, for once let it be employed to a good purpo&s;e&mdash;let us plead the cau&s;e of a &s;ex, who by nature are too feeble to employ force; and by principle too vir|tuous to u&s;e fraud, to accompli&s;h their de&s;igns. My apology is for tho&s;e young ladies, who wi&s;h to excel in endowments of the mind&mdash;will it be thought a crime, or a breach of mode&s;ty to enquire; why &s;uch an attempt &s;hould be liable to cen&s;ure&mdash;e&s;pecially as it cannot ari&s;e from mal|ice to any per&s;on whatever&mdash;if we be expo&s;ed to at lea&s;t an equal &s;hare of the mi&s;eries of life, ought we to be &s;ep|arated from its mo&s;t &s;ublime, and mo&s;t con&s;tant delights? Does not the condition of a lady require, as much as any, the delightful amu&s;ement of elegant e&s;&s;ays, of poetry and mu&s;ic? Has &s;he no need of that firmne&s;s of mind which philo&s;ophy in&s;pires? Would not the &s;ublime con&s;olations of religion greatly increa&s;e her happine&s;s? But the&s;e are enjoyed in their full force only by an enlightened mind &mdash;In a rural retirement, a &s;olitary dwelling, and &s;ilence all around her, her mo&s;t agreeable friends being abroad on bu&s;ine&s;s, to have the&s;e ideas crowd upon the mind, with which &s;he has been in&s;pired by the fine arts, by philo&s;o|phy and religion, mu&s;t a&s;&s;uredly be a great con&s;olation.</P>
<P>But it is &s;aid, that it will make all our women di&s;&s;ipat|ed and idle&mdash;how does this apear? Do men who have wives well educated in point of learning pro&s;per in their affairs le&s;s than others&mdash;a&s;k tho&s;e gentlemen of this a&s;&s;em|dly who&s;e wives have been the be&s;t educated, whether they find them to be le&s;s attentive to dome&s;tic concerns, or wor&s;e economi&s;ts than the others&mdash;May not more women be tru&s;ted with knowledge, as well as the&s;e. Or is there any fear that women &s;hall gain too much influence; and be|come mi&s;tre&s;&s;e&s;s of the world in &s;pite of man? When we &s;hall quit our dome&s;tic employments, put on offen&s;ive armor, and become fond of the art of war, then &s;uch an event may be feared; and not till then&mdash;Power derived from force is denied to women by the God of Nature.</P>
<P>The graces, the virtues, the art of plea&s;ing, are the on|ly ways by which women can influence the minds and actions of men&mdash;the fear of tho&s;e who hold learning to be d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">gerou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to ladies amounts to this&mdash;that they are afraid that they &s;hall be too much attracted; that their rea&s;on
<PB N="500" REF="034600_0489_0FFF367BCBB25E98">
will force them to approve of the conduct of the ladies, and that they &s;hall be attached to the ladies, even again&s;t their own inclination. If the ladies then wi&s;h to indulge a &s;troke of policy let it be this: to gain the approbation of tho&s;e who cen&s;ure us; &amp; to make even &s;atiri&s;ts confe&s;s, that we act with propriety&mdash;this is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with our principles&mdash;and there is nothing more conducive to this purpo&s;e than the information, which the arts afford&mdash;we may &s;afely acquire as much knowledge, as our &s;ituation in life will admit, oppo&s;ing to the geniu&s;es of the age, who ridicule the &s;tudies of women, the &s;entiment of Cicero;
<Q>While other pur&s;uits &s;uit not to all ages, and &s;tations; that of learning agrees to all. It &s;trengthens the minds of youth, and gives joy in old age&mdash;It adorns pro&s;perity, and comforts us in affliction&mdash;at home it is delightful, and it is a help to bu&s;ine&s;s abroad&mdash;it attends us in our travels, and is the joy of our rural retirements&mdash;and tho we our&s;elves were incapable of the arts, we &s;hould &s;till admire them, and be captivated with their charms, when we beheld them in others.</Q></P>

<HEAD>THE BENEFITS OF LEARNING ARE AB|SOLUTE. The <HI>INTERMEDIATE SPEECH</HI> at the <HI>GENTLEMEN'S EXHIBITION,</HI>
<DATE>March <HI>25</HI>th, <HI>1795.</HI></DATE></HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MR. CHARLES WHEELER.</BYLINE>
<P>IT becomes my duty now to pre&s;ent my&s;elf before you; and perhaps I cannot do it better than to &s;how the merits of learning&mdash;This &s;ubject has been variou&s;ly treated by others; but I propo&s;e to my&s;elf a track, new and untrod|den before. My de&s;ign is not to prove that learning is a benefit, but that it is nece&s;&s;ary&mdash;I &s;hall not pretend to &s;how that we can do very well with it; but we cannot do with|out it&mdash;whatever a man learns is a part of learning&mdash;And I leave you to judge whether a man can render him&s;elf con&s;picuous or u&s;eful without learning any <HI>thing</HI>&mdash;For he who learns one thing, to &s;ay that what another learns is u&s;ele&s;s&mdash;is judging out of his line, and is, probaby, judg|ing wrong.</P>
<P>There are two means by which men become con&s;picuous in the world: one is by gifts of nature, and the other by &s;uit|able education&mdash;mere natural qualities without education, have indeed an intrin&s;ic value, but like a diamond, rude from the mine, are rough and unplea&s;ing, while education without natural powers, is weak and ineffectual&mdash;but when to good natural qualities there &s;ucceeds a good and prop|er education, that pre&s;ents human nature in its brighte&s;t glory.</P>
<P>Alas, what is man, dive&s;ted of the &s;ciences and all tho&s;e arts for which learning is nece&s;&s;ary&mdash;a &s;tupid &s;taring, un|couth animal, centred in him&s;elf and &s;elfi&s;h gratifications. Say that he can neither write, nor read, that he knows nothing of numbers, and that he cannot &s;peak without offending the hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er&mdash;dive&s;t him al&s;o of the mechanic arts; for they originate in philo&s;ophy, and &s;kill in hu&s;|bandry, for that al&s;o is a branch of learning&mdash;what is he? a mere &s;avage, a kind of brute, a little hand&s;omer in|deed, than his brother bears in the woods&mdash;but as much
<PB N="503" REF="034600_0492_0FFF116CB4395AB0">
without morals, as much a prey to his pa&s;&s;ions; what would di&s;tingui&s;h him chiefly from them, is, that he is ca|pable of improvement.</P>
<P>Surely then, the con&s;equence is obtained by clear rea&s;on|ing that he ought to be improved; and the benefit of making progre&s;s is as ea&s;ily di&s;cernible&mdash;if one degree of knowledge (&s;uppo&s;ing a man's heart innocent) makes him better, another makes him better &s;till; and &s;o on to infin|ity.</P>
<P>What is the rea&s;on, that we are &s;o unfeeling to each others rights, and &s;o often injure each other in &s;ociety&mdash;it is becau&s;e we are deficient in two points of learning&mdash;1&s;t we have never learned to govern our&s;elves&mdash;next becau&s;e we have never been taught to re&s;pect one another. There is not a &s;ingle virtue, but mu&s;t fir&s;t be known before it can be practi&s;ed&mdash;nor a &s;ingle vice which we &s;hall avoid unle&s;s we know how it is done.</P>
<P>It is a very great error in any per&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that the gratifications of mere corporeal &s;en&s;es are &s;uperior to the plea&s;ures of the mind and imagination&mdash;that they ex|ceed the &s;ublime delights of inten&s;e friend&s;hip, of &s;incere and virtuous love, the noble flights of the imagination, the plea&s;ure of u&s;eful knowledge, and the heartfelt whi&s;|pers of an approving con&s;cience&mdash;yet this error, is com|mon to men in a rude uncultivated &s;tate, the gro&s;s indul|gence of appetite, and the unbounded rage of their pa&s;&s;ions, being almo&s;t the only delights of which they form any idea.</P>
<P>But, if the ardor for knowledge which at pre&s;ent exi&s;ts in our nation &s;hall continue&mdash;we hope &s;oon to &s;ee the day, when it &s;hall be rare to &s;ee a youth deliver him&s;elf up to riot, and inebriation&mdash;when the in&s;tance &s;hall be &s;till rarer, that under the color of love and good will&mdash;he &s;hall in|troduce vice and contamination into a once innocent and happy family, and when to get an office, in order, to be|tray the public, &s;hall be utterly unknown&mdash;we hope that education &s;hall have &s;uch force, that the objects of de&s;ire, &s;hall be perfectly innocent and harmle&s;s enjoyments&mdash;that the intention of wealth &s;hall be u&s;efulne&s;s; when love &s;hall ble&s;s the object of its flame; and ambition &s;hall aim at the good of a nation, and at mankind.</P>

<P>I HOPE to meet with the countenance &amp; encouragement of this a&s;&s;embly, while I attempt a theme of which, I tru&s;t, all will confe&s;s the utility. I would &s;peak the prai&s;es of a long and heavy pur&s;e&mdash;Well &s;tuffed with &s;ub&s;tantial coin&mdash; While Orations are made on all other &s;ubjects of all kinds
<PB N="507" REF="034600_0496_0FFF365376B42298">
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">it &s;eems quite improper that this &s;hould be neglected. The pre&s;ent &s;carcity of ca&s;h, mu&s;t give peculiar force to the arguments with which this theme abounds&mdash;It is gener|ally the &s;carcity of any thing, which is valuable, which ef|fectually teaches us to e&s;teem it&mdash;Who then can be more &s;en&s;ible than we are of the value of that ready a&s;&s;i&s;tant in all manner of bu&s;ine&s;s? Some have a&s;&s;erted that it is in the power of money to do anything&mdash;That it can change vice into imaginary virtue, and deformity into beauty&mdash;But while we are &s;peaking in this re&s;pectable a&s;&s;embly; we have nothing to &s;ay of vice, but that it exi&s;ts not here&mdash;and while we are addre&s;&s;ing this lovely choir of ladies, to mention de|formity would be &s;traying wide from the purpo&s;e&mdash; It will not be denied, that with the perfection of beauty, it is very well to po&s;&s;e&s;s a hand&s;ome intere&s;t in pecuniary matters&mdash;It makes the heart cheerful, and the bu&s;ine&s;s of life ea&s;y&mdash;It is written of Mrs. Primro&s;e the celebrated wife of the Vicar of Wakefield, that &s;he would have her daughters each carry in her pocket a guinea, without ever changing it, to keep them in &s;pirits. If a &s;ingle guinea has &s;uch virtue, what may not be expected from a long and heavy pur&s;e, well &s;tuffed with them? It mu&s;t doubtle&s;s do wonders. There are tho&s;e who maintain that many evils ari&s;e from the length, and heavine&s;s of the pur&s;e&mdash;That it makes prodigals of young heirs; and in&s;tigates them to all manner of exce&s;&s;es. But that their pur&s;e is not to be blamed may readily be proved from o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e ea&s;y &s;uppo&s;ition. Money is ju&s;t as willing to do good as to do evil, nay it an&s;wers its own purpo&s;e be&s;t by being the in&s;trument of happine&s;s to human-kind&mdash;If it does, a man's money is no more to blame for his crimes than his bodily &s;trength for his committing murder&mdash; For my part tho I have never experienced &s;o much of the benefit of money, as &s;ome men have, yet the little I have had has done me &s;o much good, that I mo&s;t earne&s;tly de&s;ire to have more, and I &s;hall think it &s;trange if you doubt of my &s;incerity in this a&s;&s;ertion&mdash;I have a &s;trong imagination that if I had a great fortune I &s;hould do much good with it&mdash;And if I could hand&s;omely come to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of an affluent e&s;tate&mdash;I have &s;o much confidence in my own integrity, that I &s;hould not be afraid to tru&s;t my&s;elf with it. And while I am wi&s;hing for a great plenty of money my&s;elf, I cannot help wi&s;hing that my neighbors had more
<PB N="508" REF="034600_0497_0FFF3688B89F6C20">
than they have, and in this re&s;pect I hope I have the hap|pine&s;s of coinciding with their own ideas. I will allow that virtue is of more value than money&mdash;for virtue can procure money, but money cannot buy virtue&mdash;I will al&s;o allow health to be better than ca&s;h: becau&s;e without health we cannot enjoy our money&mdash;but money is the third great ble&s;&s;ing of human life. Therefore, Ladies and gentlemen &mdash;that you may all have the con&s;olations of virtue&mdash;the ble&s;&s;ings of health, and the convenience of a plenty of Dol|lars&mdash;and that I may have my full &s;hare of each, is the hearty de&s;ire of your very humble Servant.</P>

<L>THE &s;ummer's plea&s;ing &s;ea&s;on now is pa&s;t,</L>

<L>Let us reflect what prudence we have learned&mdash;</L>
<L>What wi&s;dom in the &s;ummer months di&s;cerned.</L>
<L>I've heard a tragic tale&mdash;Tho grief remain,</L>
<L>Yet if we learn di&s;cretion that is gain.</L>
<L>Two LILLIES of the faire&s;t virgin hue,</L>
<L>In the &s;ame vale nigh to each other grew;</L>
<L>One gave her beauties to the blaze of day,</L>
<L>From the bold gaze the other turned way;</L>
<L>And if a &s;avage figure chanced to pa&s;s,</L>
<L>Would veil her beauties in &s;urrounding gra&s;s;</L>
<L>Thro this &s;ame vale one mo&s;t unhappy day,</L>
<L>A lordly BEAR, &s;low &s;auntering, found his way.</L>
<L>The forward flower, impatient to be &s;een,</L>
<L>Di&s;played the beauties of her &s;hape and mein.</L>
<L>Turned on her &s;tem to meet his haughty eyes,</L>
<L>And bade the &s;weete&s;t gales of fragrance ri&s;e.</L>
<L>A leaf he cropped, but &s;carcely owned 'twas &s;weet,</L>
<L>Then trod the beauteous flower beneath his feet.</L>
<L><PB N="509" REF="034600_0498_0FFF3655F33E5CC8">Warned by her &s;i&s;ter's fate, the living flower</L>

<L>Would clo&s;e her leaves, and veil her beauties quite.</L>
<L>At la&s;t a FLORSIT came, the meads to trace;</L>
<L>True friend to flowers, and guardian of their race.</L>
<L>She heard his hone&s;t fame in whi&s;pering gales,</L>

<L>'Tis true, each bee, each bird, each in&s;ect &s;aid,</L>

<L>As gently he drew nigh, with looks &s;erene,</L>
<L>The flower, tho mode&s;t, ventured to be &s;een.</L>
<L>With gentle touch, and gentler breath, it's true,</L>
<L>Partly, her beauties met his raptured view,</L>
<L>Her lovely colors beaming on his &s;ight,</L>
<L>Her fragrance filled his &s;en&s;e with keen delight.</L>
<L>With gentle&s;t hand he reared her tender head;</L>

<P>We &s;hall believe that you love virtue, and are di&s;po&s;ed to encourage learning; by the friendly countenance which you have given to both&mdash;It is the intention of the young gentlemen ever to de&s;erve your approbation. Permit me, my bretheren, to expre&s;s what I believe to be your &s;enti|ments, to this a&s;&s;embly&mdash;You are determined to pur&s;ue tho&s;e methods of life; by which you may be re&s;pectable in your&s;elves, and u&s;eful to &s;ociety&mdash;We will ever (I tru&s;t you will &s;upport me in the a&s;&s;ertion) maintain a grateful &s;en&s;e of the various means by which our kind parents have la|bored for our happine&s;s. The fair advantages for acquir|ing u&s;eful knowledge, the kind in&s;tructions we have receiv|ed from our neare&s;t relations, and from this &s;chool, lead us to virtue, and to real prai&s;e. We do not place our happi|ne&s;s, worthy parents and friends, in riot, and debauchery
<PB N="515" REF="034600_0504_0FFF365BC599BF10">
&mdash;We have no imagination, that noi&s;y revels, gaming par|ties, &s;cenes of lewdne&s;s, or low knavery, are calculated to convey joy and happine&s;s to the &s;oul&mdash;We do not im|agine that to de&s;pi&s;e the coun&s;els of parents, to contract habits of impiety and profanity, which are always attended with &s;avagene&s;s of manners, are ways to gain e&s;teem Nor have we formed any idea of happine&s;s as exi&s;ting in tran|&s;ient &s;en&s;ations of joy, or mirth &s;ucceeded by the &s;evere&s;t remor&s;e&mdash;No&mdash;We &s;uppo&s;e that probity is honor, and that virtue is happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Speaking of happine&s;s, an idea occurs intima<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ly connec|ted therewith. It is that of conver&s;ing with tho&s;e who&s;e gra|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s &amp; virtues and beauties nece&s;&s;arily excite felicity&mdash;we be|lieve the &s;acred text, which &s;aith, that after the &s;upreme had formed ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, he from the &s;ub&s;tance of the man, and from materials taken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ear his heart, formed another being more beautiful, more graceful, more lovely&mdash; We believe it for we feel to this day the &s;en&s;ible angui&s;h of that primi|tive wound, nor do we expect that our hearts &s;hall know &s;ettled tranquility, or we have permanent happine&s;s of the &s;oul, till the materials, ravi&s;hed by the divine hand, from the very &s;prings of life, be re&s;tored to their native &s;eat&mdash;We hope, ladies, to convince you, that to be near our heats, is to live at your proper home.</P>
<P>Yet think not, therefore, that tho&s;e here pre&s;ent, who&s;e families are illuminated with many of tho&s;e brighte&s;t gems of beauty, need &s;ecure tho&s;e trea&s;ures from our approach. Need you defend them by bolts, or bars, or brazen walls? We have no idea that there can be love, where there is a de|&s;ign to de&s;troy: we &s;uppo&s;e that it might as truly be &s;aid of the hawk that he loves the trembling bird, whom he pierces with his cruel talons&mdash;of the wolf that he loves the lamb when he &s;ucks her reeking blood&mdash;as that the perfidious traitor loves the innocent and blooming maiden; when he &s;eeks to ruin her be&s;t intere&s;ts, and to fully her &s;potle&s;s fame. Let that heart peri&s;h which harbors a &s;avave &s;elfi&s;h de&s;ire, burning only to de&s;troy. Our idea of love is that of a mo&s;t innocent harmle&s;s kind affection; &s;eeking always the good of its object, like that of the guardian angel over the precious &s;aint, by heaven committed to his care&mdash; In re&s;pect to the&s;e amiable beings, whom we mu&s;t ever ad|mire and e&s;teem, you will ever, I tru&s;t, find our conduct to be void of blame.</P>
<P><PB N="516" REF="034600_0505_0FFF36951FAD11E0">N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w young ladies, you perceive, that we have entirely cut our&s;elves off from the refuge of lies, we have been telling your parents, a precious plau&s;ible &s;tory, how good, how hone&s;t and how harmle&s;s we mean to be, in all our conver|&s;ation with you&mdash;It happens that you are &s;o near as to hear every word&mdash;we have now no advantage to deceive you; and &s;hould we attempt any wicked &s;ophi&s;try&mdash;you would confute us from our own mouths&mdash;yes, ladies, you have that advantage over us, nor do we wi&s;h to recal it: keep it and make the utmo&s;t of it, you can. We will further tell you, and our hearts witne&s;s it to be true,&mdash;that every injury from a man to a woman, proceeds from open, or &s;ecret contempt; from a mind carele&s;s of your be&s;t intere&s;ts, and actuated by mean and &s;elfi&s;h motives&mdash;reverence your|&s;elves ladies, and it will be impo&s;&s;ible that we &s;hould not re&s;pect and love you.</P>
<P>But need we become your advi&s;ers&mdash;you know the&s;e things; the&s;e &s;entiments are conformable to your daily practice. What re&s;pect, what admiration have not your accompli&s;hments, your graces and virtues, in&s;pired. All eyes, ranks acd profe&s;&s;ions, of men, &s;peak of you with plea&s;ure and &s;ay&mdash;How accompli&s;hed and how virtu|ous are the young ladies of the&s;e days&mdash;We hope the time is rapidly advancing, when the parents &s;hall no more &s;hed bitter tears for the weakne&s;s of a daughter; nor a brother, by a &s;i&s;ter's fault, feel the venomed &s;ting of infamy in his heart&mdash;When there &s;hall be no more hurting or de&s;troying, in all the land, of innocent and virtuous love.</P>
<P>FRIENDS OF THE ASSEMBLY, AT LARGE,</P>
<P>The moral, all the &s;ocial and virtuous affections, are &s;trengthened by the cultivation of the liberal arts&mdash;Nay, by education we may turn the whole force of habit, on the &s;ide of virtue, and real religion. This matter &s;eems to be better under&s;tood now than formerly, and in&s;tead of mere language &amp; the more ab&s;tract &s;ciences, it becomes more generally the practice in &s;chools to in&s;till into the minds of youth the principles of religion and morals. In&s;tead of con&s;idering religion and virtue as the re&s;traints and let|ters of the mind&mdash;they are regarded as the helm and com|pa&s;s, to convey us to happine&s;s, thro the boi&s;terous ocean of human affairs. The moral part of &s;cience; and tho&s;e which affect the heart&punc; are much more &s;tudied than in former times&mdash;and the charming &s;ex are advancing from a &s;tate of

<P>We feel a di&s;advantage by way of compari&s;on&mdash;only a few weeks ago you &s;aw on this &s;tage, &s;uch performances as had a peculiar advantage to attract the attention. We can|not doubt that the benign countenance of &s;o full an audience was greatly owing to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e amiable young ladies, who then united the &s;ublime and beautiful in their performances.</P>
<P>Animated by your pre&s;ence; a&s;&s;i&s;ted by all that was amiable; we exceeded our proper &s;elves, and &s;hone with the reflected rays of genius and beauty. All experiments, ladies, prove that we cannot attain our proper perfection without your &s;ociety. This day have we been de&s;titute of that advantageous a&s;&s;i&s;tance. It made us deeply feel our &s;olitude. But the countenance you have maintained to|wards us, hath been a delicious con&s;olation. It is your faculty, ladies, to indulge a kind and benevolent heart, and to make many happy without the lea&s;t departure from true dignity. The&s;e and a thou&s;and other agreeable qualities, are daily increa&s;ing your influence on our hearts.</P>
<P>We tru&s;t, re&s;pected fathers and mothers of families, that you will not blame us for regarding our once charming companions in our &s;tudies. You will readily believe, that their &s;ociety mu&s;t be plea&s;ing to us: but your wi&s;dom hath determined, that in &s;ome in&s;tances, we &s;hould be de|prived of their &s;ociety; and that they &s;hall not mix the common cour&s;e of their &s;tudies with ours. But without any impeachment of your wi&s;dom, we cannot but rejoice, that there is a way, in which we may attain the permanent ble&s;&s;ings of their &s;ociety, without injury to them; and we humbly hope, without offence to you.</P>

<HEAD>Conclusion.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author, having completed the plan of his work, would take a decent farewell of his readers. He has en|deavored to &s;et in a clear light, in his Dialogues, &s;ome of the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful principles of morality, and religion; and to awaken, and exemplify, tho&s;e decent and tender affections, which form the felicity of dome&s;tic life&mdash; the&s;e are more level to the comprehen&s;ion of per&s;ons under twenty years of age&mdash;than the &s;peeches of generals at the head of armies, or the high wrought &s;atires&punc; which find acceptance in old and corrupted courts: and the author &s;uppo&s;es they have a better effect on the hearts of young per&s;ons of both &s;exes. And are more &s;uitable to the &s;im|plicity of manners generally prevailing in our common|wealth&mdash;He condemns not other men's works however&mdash;all may be u&s;eful in their place.</P>
<P>The manu&s;cript copy of this wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k, contained about 1,100 pages in quarto, clo&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y written, and the book was printed wholly from the manu&s;cript. It may be tho't not &s;trange therefore, that there &s;hould be &s;ome errata in it&mdash;the au|thor &s;uppo&s;es that half the errors aro&s;e from his manu|&s;cript. The printer will not then be chargeable, with any great number. The following he thinks ought to be no|ticed becau&s;e they confound the &s;en&s;e of the pa&s;&s;ages in which they are found.</P>

But it is not in the Author's power to give a li&s;t of the Sub&s;cribers; for not one half of the Papers are returned. If the work lives to another edition, the Author will treat all his encouragers with due honors; and will publi&s;h a correct li&s;t of the Sub&s;cribers. But if the work mu&s;t die in the infancy of its exi&s;tence, the Sub&s;cribers may think it be&s;t, that their names were not annexed to it. The type is &s;maller than the Author at fir&s;t intended&mdash;but on that account the book contains more matter; which, in a book of this kind, is an advantage&mdash;A larger type with the &s;ame materials mu&s;t have made a book out of all proportion for a duodecimo&mdash;and the Author could not have afforded it at the a&s;&s;igned price. Wi&s;hing his Patrons, and his Read|ers, all happine&s;s in this, and the better life&mdash;he remains their &s;incere friend and</P>
