<P>That business with which you intrusted me, (certainly, in the present situation of society, a business of the utmost im|portance) the care of explaining and giving force to the laws of our country, I executed with anxious attention&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SEMBLANCE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me there&mdash;I cannot say that you were so attentive to business as I expected&mdash;You disappointed me very much in that particular.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SEMBLANCE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Have not I known of your refusing large fees, and turn|ing fat clients from the office?&mdash;</P>

<SPEAKER>WHITELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I did, Sir; and would have lost my life before I would de|sert the cause of humanity. The profession of a lawyer may be exercised in the fullest conformity to the rules of universal justice and expansive benevolence, as we know by the exam|ples of many around us: it is such as you who bring upon it the vulgar sarcasms of the undiscriminating and thoughtless. For myself, soon disgusted with your manner of living, and your manner of practice, I should have thrown off the lucra|tive connexion, but for the persuasions of a beloved wife, who, having felt the rude and 'numbing grasp of poverty, anxiously sought to guard our children from it. For her and them I labour'd&mdash;that is past&mdash;for she and they&mdash;are&mdash;dead&mdash;<HI>(struggling to repress his feelings)</HI>&mdash;Pshaw&mdash;this is weak|ness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SEMBLANCE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, they are dead, Mr. Whitely; and I can sympathize with you. My poor Beckky too&mdash;I, too, have had my af|flictions; I, too, have lost a wife; torn from me, and from my daughter&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>She was a loss&mdash;but a loss had not virtue to feel. Tell not me of your affliction: you rejoiced in her death; nor do I believe it ever gave you pain, except, perhaps, a momentary pang, from the remembrance of your conduct towards her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SEMBLANCE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! <HI>this</HI> is telling the truth again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>She was, indeed, a loss to her daughter. Poor girl! denied the advantages of that wealth which you accumulate but to misuse, you keep her, though now a woman, at an obscure country boarding-school, that her presence may not check the secret indulgences of those sensual pleasures, in which you seek for happiness.</P>

<P><HI>He</HI> is supreme among the wretched, who dares not listen to sincerity. You are a wretch, whose every moment of se|curity depends upon the strength of the cob-web veil woven by your own hypocrisy. You start from the eye of inquiry. You tremble at the breath of truth. Detection, a phantom, painted by your own fears, is for ever before your eyes. You redouble your arts of deceit, and daily become more con|temptible and more miserable.</P>

<P>The being who has it in his power to do good to a fellow being, has happiness within his reach, though he do the deed in hell, such as poets have painted it. I will point out the road which will lead you to felicity. Quit your business; fly the usual haunts of your vices; and thus weaken your evil habits and give strength to your growing reason.&mdash;</P>

<P>Ha, ha! no, pardon me there. Tom is wild&mdash;is often enticed or hurried into scenes of vicious dissipation; but he has no prejudices; no fixed habits; his mind is not encum|bered with one cloud which may intercept a single ray of science. And what I love the dear lad for most, is, that during the five years I have known him I do not believe that a falshood has passed his lips. And that is rather an extra|ordinary circumstance, considering his connection with us, brother Semblance.</P>

<SPEAKER>SEMBLANCE.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, no, pardon me there; for 'though <HI>you</HI> have a way of looking through people, I am certain Tom must, and does, look upon me as a pattern of regularity, prudence and morality. Don't he see me regularly at church&mdash;that is, he might if he had the grace to go there. Don't he see a model of oeconomy and frugality in my family?</P>

<P>Don't he see order and frugality in every thing I do?</P>

<SPEAKER>WHITELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do not continue to deceive yourself&mdash;I am pretty certain that Tom knows you, for what you are&mdash;a hypocrite.

<P>For heaven's sake Mr. Whitely&mdash;my dear friend&mdash;do not let your love of truth lead you to mention these things, even to myself.&mdash;Oh dear!&mdash;I believe I have been wrong&mdash;I am a miserable old man! My dear partner!&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WHITELY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Be not alarm'd. For although every particle of know|ledge possessed by me is due to the world, I have so far power over it, that I need not discharge the debt until I see the moment when the greatest sum of good will be produced by the payment. I shall never do any thing to injure you&mdash;

I thought the private door had been unknown even to him&mdash;I'll not believe that Tom knows it. Whitely was up when I came in this morning; the moon shone; might he not have seen me? Heigh ho!

<P>Never, Sir, never. What can be the pleasure of a game|ster? Has his soul one moment of calm or self-enjoyment? If he gains, his gain is always below desire; if he loses, rage and despair take possession of his soul. The feelings of hu|manity are banished from the gamester's heart; he thirsts for the ruin of his nominal friend, who equally burns with de|sire to ruin him.</P>

<P>How impressive is truth, even from the lips of falshood! Well, Sir, but at least the table has its pleasures for you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SEMBLANCE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Rather say its poisons. When I am tempted by good cheer, sparkling wine, seducing society, I represent to my|self the consequences of excess, an aching head, disordered stomach, clouded reason, loss of time&mdash;this saves me&mdash;I eat just enough to support my strength; my health is always equal; my ideas always pure and luminous. But all this is so easy, Sir, that there is even no merit in the practice.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOM.</SPEAKER>
<P>I acknowledge, Sir, the truth of your observations; nor shall you find me backward in the practice. You are now, Sir, old; you know me capable of business; you know my pretensions to your daughter; give me her hand and put me into your practice, and you shall see in my conduct a pattern to all husbands and all attornies.</P>

<P>Now then to business. I am an Englishman, d'y'see, and my name's George Grapple. I was born and bred to the sea; and have serv'd on board man of war or frigate from the time I knew a cabouse from a compass. I was appointed to the command of the <HI>Pretty Betsey,</HI> of 26 guns, and order'd to cruize off your coast, where I had not been two days, when I fell in with a French frigate of 34 guns, whom I 'spied by day-break bearing down upon us, with a crowd of canvass; we bore up to meet her with merry hearts, prepar|ing for action; and we were soon at it, yard-arm and yard|arm. All my masts were shot by the board, and I had no|thing left for it but grappling. I order'd it, and was an|swer'd by shouts; when a volley of hand-granades set fire to my forecastle, and in a minute we were all in flames. I got out my long-boat to save my men, and the gallant French|men, as soon as they saw our distress, ceas'd firing, and came to our assistance in their's. I saw my brave men safe from the fire; but for myself, I remain'd on my quarter-deck, with my eye fixed on the colours of my country, resolv'd to go to the bottom with my own <HI>Pretty Betsey.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SEMBLANCE.</SPEAKER>
<P>What a devil! he's put me in a cold sweat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOM.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the mean time, a young French officer who had quitted his ship to come to our succour, seeing my resolution, threw
<PB N="35" REF="032066_0034_0FF10D4BF1A34A68">
his pistols and cutlass into the sea, and, leaping on board my vessel, advanced towards me through fire and smoke, with a white handkerchief waving in his hand, beseeching me to save myself. I had scarcely time to notice the young devil, when, seizing me in his arms, he leaped with me into the sea, and, before we 'ro&s;e to the water's surface again, my ship blew up and disappeared for ever. Here's a health to the young <HI>Sansculotte.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SEMBLANCE.</SPEAKER>
<P>With all my heart. <HI>(Drinks.)</HI> Truly, captain, that was a hotter <HI>action</HI> than ever I was engaged in; though I have made many a defendant sweat.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOM.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hotter, but not more destructive, old boy. Those who are born to be hung are in no danger of drowning. Myself and the Frenchman pop'd up again among the damnedest dashing and splashing of water that ever I saw, occasioned by the ship's explosion. However, we both swam like Mo|ther Carey's chickens, and were soon safe on board the French frigate, who brought us to-day into your harbour, and I am come in the same trim in which I fought my ship, to lay my complaints before you. You see I did'n't fight in my fair|weather suit.</P>

<P>No, dam'me, he's a man. But to go on with my story. As good luck would have it, I brought off with me my pocket-book well lined; and learning that my deliverer was a mere volunteer, and of no fortune, I wanted to share with him: but no, he will not take a guinea. From the time of our meeting we have never parted. We love one another entirely. He is the best lad that ever step'd between the

Was I to moralize on the transactions of the day, I should sum up all in the old adage, "Honesty is the best policy," and advise all within hearing, in the words of Hot|spur, to "tell truth and shame the devil&mdash;ever, while you live, guardy, tell the truth and shame the devil."</P>

<L>" SUSAN no more&mdash;I seize the lively strain.</L>
<L>" Place mirth in view, and I'm myself again.&mdash;</L>
<L>" Tell truth and shame the devil! stupid calf!</L>
<L>" Tell truth and shame ourselves, more like by half.</L>
<L>" In every thing that's done some secret lurks;</L>
<L>" Life's spirit lies in turns, and shifts, and quirks&mdash;</L>
<L>" The world's a Theatre, and life a play,</L>
<L>" With changing scenes and acts&mdash;some people say:</L>
<L>" What a dull thing this play of life would prove,</L>
<L>" Without disguise or plot our mirth to move?</L>
<L>" Without inventions, counterplots and shamming,</L>
<L>" I believe t'would meet a very hearty damning.</L>
<L>" We're every one in habits of disguise,</L>
<L>" Should we unmask, it might create surprize:</L>
<L>" But yet I can't believe it would be wise.</L>
<L>" Betty, Miss Tittup's maid, by Cupid wounded,</L>
<L>" But for invention's aid might be confounded:</L>
<L>" Ta'en by surprize, the sighing swain is thrust</L>
<L>" Close in the closet, Betty's wit his trust:&mdash;</L>

" He coughs or sneezes&mdash;" Betty, pray what's that?"</L>
<L>" <HI>I</HI> don't hear <HI>nothing,</HI> Madam&mdash;Oh&mdash;the cat!"</L>
<L>" Sure such a fib comes in sometimes quite pat.</L>
<L>" Your plain truth telling's quite a hum-drum thing,</L>
<L>" 'Tis difficulty gives the mind its spring,</L>
<L>" And falshoods always difficulties bring.</L>
<L>" Truth telling suits with virtue and dull merit,</L>
<L>" But is at war with every thing like spirit&mdash;</L>
<L>" Spirit's the word&mdash;my system I declare&mdash;</L>
<L>" Life as it goes and things just as they are!</L>
<L>" If you agree&mdash;of course our play you'll spare."</L>
