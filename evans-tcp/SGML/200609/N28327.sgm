<P>IT <HI>will be acceptable to the reader to know something of the history of the circumnaviga|tor</HI> LA PEYROUSE, <HI>which has given rise to this dramatic piece.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Count</HI> DE LA PEYROUSE <HI>sailed from Brest har|bour on the 26th of June 1785, with the frigates Astrolable and Bousole; touched at the Island of St. Catharine, on the coast of Brazil, and sailed round Cape Horn, and along the coasts of Chili and California. Afterwards he touched at Easter Island, Nootka-sound, Cooks River, Kamschatka, Manilla, the</HI> Isles des Navigateurs, <HI>the Sandwich, the friendly Islands, and Norfolk Island, and ar|rived in Botany Bay on the 26th of January 1788; from whence he transmitted home by Governor Phil|lips at Port Jackson, all his papers, journals, maps, plans, views, &amp;c. and sailed from thence on the 10th

of March following. &mdash; Since which time he has not been heard of, but is supposed to have lost both his ships among the Ice Islands, in his run towards the South Pole, on discovery. His journal from 1785 to 1788, has since been published at Paris by order of the Directory, and lately translated in London. The Corvettes</HI> La Recherche, <HI>and</HI> L'Esperance, <HI>sailed from France in 1790, under the command of Captain Entrecasteux, and returned in 1793, with|out having gained their object; which was, to search for the unfortunate Count</HI> DE LA PEYROUSE.</P>

<P>THE fog clears away &mdash; still combating with the sun &mdash; still darkening the surface of the sea &mdash; thus calumny covers virtue, creates romantic appearances, and is finally swallowed up by the force of truth. &mdash; Ah! what a spectacle! already the peak of a mountain on the nearest island raises itself out of the vapours &mdash; thin clouds only are seen to hover yet around it. &mdash; Now the fog forms itself into balls on the deep, the beautiful surface of the sea becomes visible &mdash; the circle expands every moment &mdash; my breast becomes fuller &mdash; the view brighter &mdash; and the Creator forces from me a tear of high affliction as my morning pray|ers! &mdash; Do I not see at a distance some white point? &mdash; A small cloud &mdash; no &mdash; a sea bird &mdash; a swan &mdash; no &mdash; God! &mdash; What deception! &mdash; A sail! &mdash; A ship! &mdash; Poor forsaken! do not rejoice too soon! &mdash; An image of your dream juggles hope before your eyes. &mdash; And yet &mdash; it moves &mdash; it proceeds &mdash; not so the course of clouds &mdash; the flight of birds &mdash; away from my eyes you clouds of fog!

<P>Ah my good child! I had a lover, a husband, thirst for glory tore him from my arms! he was my all! my world, but he went in search of a new world; he placed the globe between him and his wife. My sighs swelled his sails, prat|tling children kneeled on the sea shore, almost orphans al|ready.</P>

<P>Love is always rich in nourishment for hope. Two vessels were fitted out to go in search of the forlorn. I beg'd for a place in one of them, and should it be in the worst part of the ship. They spoke of fatigue, of dangers &mdash; they little knew what love can suffer. Yes, I am ill, my strength is exhausted &mdash; but if I find him again, the recollection of my sufferings will vanish! and if I find him not, what matters it in what region grief terminates the sorrows of a disconso|late wife!</P>

Love commanded me to go in search of the lost husband, the bemoaned father. Without me, in what language could those people enquire for you among the savage nations? Love created for me a language. Who could better than me discover the slightest traces of you? A lost piece of cloth, a name written by you upon a tree, who could have sooner discovered it than me? And if you, perhaps, were roving about in deserts and wildernesses, whose ears would your voice have sooner reached than mine?</P>

<SP>

<P>She calls you her friend.</P>
</SP>

<P>She was my benefactress.</P>

<P>More than you ought to be?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peyr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hear me and judge. On yonder rock the waves drove us, with all the furies of the elements. The ship went to pieces. Through every crevice entered death. The corps soon were swimming about the miserable wreck. I combated swimming against the fury of the waves, and thought to reach the shore, but the stream baffled my endea|vours. My strength died away &mdash; I thought once more of you &mdash; of my children &mdash; of God! and, exhausted with fa|tigue, my arms dropped. When I recovered I lay stretch|ed upon the moss, a savage girl kneeled at my side, and at the first sign of life, she made a cry of joy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had she saved you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peyr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Three times she threw herself into the foaming waves, and three times she was thrown back on the rocky shore. Death roared in vain; in vain the abyss menaced to swallow her up, or to dash her to pieces on the rocky cliffs. With the courage of a hero, and the strength of a savage, she threw herself the fourth time into the waves, caught her prize by the hair, and snatched it from the combating ele|ments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah! and for what reward?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peyr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Listen farther. This small island is uninhabited. But rarely the savages come here from yonder group of islands, to fish. Malvina was here with her father and bro|thers, who threatened to kill the stranger; the tears of Malvina only saved him. Under cocoa trees she prepared for me a place of rest, and linked the twigs over me for a roof. I slumbered sweetly. Before midnight she waked me trembling. Be quick and follow me! she said, and drew
<PB N="15" REF="037755_0015_100F45ADF2F4E818">
me away. She led me through the thicket to the sea side. There she crept with me into a cavern, embraced me ten|derly, and rejoiced at my second preservation. Her bro|thers had concluded to kill me during the night. They thought Malvina to be asleep, but Malvina listened, and perceived their intentions. Favored by the darkness she stole away, and saved me from the assassins.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>I owe her gratitude and admiration, but can I love her?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peyr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Still more! The next morning they sought Malvina. The woods re-echoed their menaces and their prayers. We heard her old father above us on the cliff, he called mourn|fully: Malvina! my daughter! will you leave me? &mdash; The girl wept, and remained.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>Enough! I forgive you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peyr.</SPEAKER>
<P>When, after a long fruitless search, the boat went off with her father and brothers, she listened between the bushes, and her tears dropped from leaf to leaf, but not a sound betrayed her grief. And when the boat appeared on the distant sea like a white point only, she pressed me weeping to her heart, and exclaimed: Now I have neither father nor brother! You are my all! Leave me not!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Adel.</SPEAKER>
<P>And she has not beg'd in vain.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Peyr.</SPEAKER>
<P>From that moment I have to thank her for my life a thousand times! Without her I would have died of hunger. She taught me to catch birds and fish in nets; she taught me the knowledge of the eatable roots and herbs, and warned me of the poisonous; she made for me these clothes of fea|thers and skins; she ornamented my habitation with shells. &mdash; Speak &mdash; What could I do? &mdash; Separated from the inhabited world, exiled forever to this place of solitude, without hope ever to see you or my native country again, what reward could I offer to my benefactress? &mdash; to her, who voluntari|ly exiled herself with me&punc; alleviated my misery, and, when
<PB N="16" REF="037755_0016_100F45B0479BE040">
she could not alleviate, voluntarily shared it with me? &mdash; She desired my heart &mdash; and I gave her a <HI>grateful heart.</HI></P>

<P>You are justified. My love mourns, but cannot con|demn you. But Alexis, what will now become of us?</P>

<P>Better <HI>one</HI> voluntary sacrifice, than grief's slow death of all. If I saw him surrounded by enemies, I would throw myself between their swords to save him. Despair is the most for|midable enemy! It gnaws the body, and deadens the soul &mdash; <HI>(a pause.)</HI> &mdash; This good girl was happy without me; and so was La Peyrouse. He thought of me but with sor|row, as if we had been separated by death. My arrival was to him the appearance of a spirit; though the form of a once beloved person, yet still a spirit. &mdash; <HI>(a pause.)</HI> This girl is young and handsome &mdash; my blooming time is past&mdash;I am no more beautified by my tears &mdash; gratitude will attach him to me &mdash; every tie is oppressive to love which is not ef|fected by its own power.&mdash;I shall not make him any re|proaches; but he will expect them, and avoid me. My too feeling mother will torment him with complaints; and me, the innocent cause, he will hate.&mdash;He hate me? No, no! but can we love the person whose presence oppresses us? Courage, Adelaide! as far as your eye-sight reaches, the horizon is obscure. Drop the curtain &mdash; but do it soon &mdash; do it now &mdash; in this moment whilst this attraction strains your nerves &mdash; whilst this fire expands your veins &mdash; who can as|sure me, that in a few hours the love of life will not reason away every future grief? I then would have to empty the cup drop by dop &mdash; better pour it down at one draught.&mdash;Well then! <HI>(she rises hastily, and picks up the fruit which she had thrown away.)</HI> How soon is such a fruit eat up. It will quench my feverish thirst &mdash; forget, what more it will ef|fect <HI>(looking at the fruit.)</HI> How beautiful, how alluring&mdash;poor human beings! in how many delightful forms death lurks for you.&mdash;Thanks to you, chance, for this last favor! No dagger makes me shrink; no nauseous poison excites disgust.&mdash;Who could be afraid of this apple?</P>

I begged <HI>much</HI> of God &mdash; God has granted me <HI>much</HI> &mdash; and now I should shrink from death, which would be a benefit to you!
