What &s;hall I do? Lord Aber|ford will be here to-morrow; that noble Lord who intended to do my daughter &s;uch honour, who in|tended to marry her: but it's all over now, for he never could bear the name of poetry and in&s;pira|tion, &s;ince one of the&s;e in&s;pired poeta&s;ters ran away with his only daughter. What will he &s;ay when he hears the ravings of my child? Why, he'll be off the match, to be &s;ure, and then what will &s;he do? <HI>She</HI> mu&s;t die an old maid, and <HI>I</HI> die of grief, I believe.</P>

<P>By my &s;oul it's true, for I'd rout every flock of &s;heep in the adjoining common; and, with my &s;word drawn, I'd quarrel and fight with the fir&s;t wind-mill that chanced to place it&s;elf in my way.</P>

<P>Nature never formed me! &s;o you mean it as a di&s;paragement to my per&s;on;&mdash;let me tell you, that I am the toa&s;t of the village; that John, our footman, is dying for me; and that Dick, the gar|dener, compared my neck to the full blown &s;un|flower, and my cheeks to the beautiful crim&s;on of the opening poppy&mdash;Nature never formed me, in|deed! Well then, one of the graces did; and

though every one is in love with my wit, I've more &s;en&s;e than to run mad, as my Mi&s;tre&s;s Matilda has done: but, I &s;uppo&s;es, it is becau&s;e her father is going to force her to marry an helple&s;s old Lord, when &s;he might have your ma&s;ter, a &s;mart young Captain; but he has no money, and &s;o he dares not openly to di&s;cover his pa&s;&s;ion.

I be&s;towed encomiums on her, which might have flattered an angel; and &s;he, &s;uppo&s;ing all a ju&s;t tribute to her beauty, eagerly believed them to be true.
