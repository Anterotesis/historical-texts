I pointed your swords against the breasts of men in arms, and ye have plunged them into the hearts of sucking babes.&mdash; Oh God, whose all-seeing eye has brooded with an awful gloom over the horrors of last night, here do I stand be|fore the rising sun, the image of thy Majesty:&mdash;Here do I stand, and with self-acquitting conscience swear, that sacred to me have ever been the duties of my order.&mdash; Blood has stained this sword, yet may every drop which has issued from the breast of a woman or a child, fall on my soul in liquid fire! Ah! what distant cries of anguish strike my ear! the shrieks of women! the screams of in|fants!&mdash;Away, Bevys! I too have a wife, I too have children. Away, Bevys! thunder to the cowards, to cease the carnage of defenceless people, and let thy mace fell to the earth him who dares to disobey.

Oh! suffering Redeemer! There, amidst the car|cases of the vanquished, have they fixed thy cross. The blood of the slain still trickles down the hill. True, 'tis but the blood of the heathens, yet surely the blood of men. And can these smoaking ruins be an acceptable sacrifice in thy sight? My heart expands. An irresistible voice calls loudly to me: "They were all thy brethren."</P>

<P>Not far from the village too, I found the monk, who accompanied us upon our expedition. I could not but laugh at the good man.

<P>Give me then your testimony, that I have honor|ably fulfilled my vow&mdash;You well know how your Ab|bot, by the pious zeal, which flowed from his lips, by papal bulls, by absolution, and promises of blessing, per|suaded me to this excursion.

<P>The words of the church's servant: his testi|mony and his blessing, bear the soul aloft, as upon the beams of light, to heavenly bliss. Shielded by them, no angel will obstruct your way. But if your choleric valor cannot brook empty words&mdash;'tis well, sir knight, to you belong <HI>deeds.</HI> Arise! Fight for the honor of your God! Is your army already weary? Is your sword already gor|ged? Behold, all the tribes which dwell upon the coast, are lost in careless indolence, and where perchance one fugitive escaped your arm, he has poured dismay and ter|ror into every trembling heart. Arise! rally your fol|lowers! away to fresh victories!</P>

<SPEAKER>The.</SPEAKER>
<P>Spare your lungs, good father, I abide by my oath. Of what avail can these base conquests be to God, to you, my country, or myself? God needs no champi|on&mdash;I could once have reckoned among my followers many a valiant warrior, to wield the sword or battle axe. What are they now? Robbers, who spare neither age nor sex, and then cast lots for plunder.</P>

<P>No, good father. I know my Adelaide. 'Tis true I raised her from the humble cottage, to make her the companion of my life; but in her veins flows as noble blood, as if her ancestors had been a race of heroes. &mdash;Never has one thought, unworthy of her present rank, reminded me of what she was. How often, when I have been summoned to the field, has she, with her own hands buckled on my harness, and with a chearful mien gone with me to the castle gate! But yesterday, unaccounta|ble presages seemed to labour in her breast. Her parting kiss was bathed in tears, and with a voice of heart-felt

<P>To spare! Truly she was mighty generous. Are not these the very heathens, who, some eight years ago, in one of their excursions, dragged her father into bondage?</P>

<P>True, and Adelaide has mourned his loss, but not by renouncing her humanity. The mean sensation of revenge is foreign to her.</P>

her the reason of her grief. "I am an orphan," answer|ed she,
"ere I could lisp, I lost my mother; and but a few days since, the Vandals robbed me of my father."
Her words, her tears, sunk deep into my heart. I went &mdash;and I returned. I saw her oft, yet never saw her enough.&mdash;My uncle had fixed upon a lady of high birth to be my wife&mdash;but all in vain! Already was I bound in the soft chains of love. I laughed at ancestry and riches. I led my Adelaide to the altar.&mdash;Thanks be to heaven, I never, for a moment, have repented such a choice!

Dost thou think thou shalt be less my father, because blind fate has made thy son-in-law a knight, and thee a boor? &mdash;Fear it not. Thou art the father of my wife. I will revere thee.

My tears were mingled with the water; for you may remem|ber, at that time the Vandals had just robbed me of my father, the only prop of my poor helpless youth. Sir Theobald saw me, loved me, and made me the happiest of women. Shall I not celebrate this day? Long as I live, these pitchers shall retain their place among my bridal ornaments. Never do I fail, upon this day, as soon as I have finished my morning prayer, to visit yonder well. My reason tells me that it is to recollect my former lowli|ness.

<P>For more than twenty years, Hugo of Wulfingen has been my friend. I have fought at his side in Parthia, Media, Mesipotamia, and Persia. Oft, with fraternal love, we bound each other's wounds, inflicted by the sa|bres of our enemies. Oft, with fraternal love, we shared the last dry crust, the last poor draught: until the wayward chance of war divided us. For when the em|peror Frederick died, he went towards Askelon with En|glish Richard, surnamed Coeur de Lion. There was the battle between Saladin and us. Fierce and bloody was the contest. Many a valiant knight was left upon the field. Among the rest your father was supposed to have fallen&punc; and I spent many tedious years in vain enquiries after him. At length, weary with toil, I, eight months since resolved on my return to this my native land, when unexpectedly, I found old Hugo among the sultan's pri|soners in Babylon.</P>

<P>For fifteen years your daughter was educated as my own. She increased in stature, beauty, worth. She enchanted every youth, attended on my age, and mana|ged on my wife's decease, my little household. Never did any one suspect her to be other than the real daughter of old Bertram. My wife died, and carried the secret with her to the grave. I alone was able to solve the mystery of her descent. I knew your sentiments, Sir knight; I resolved never to withdraw the veil which covered what was past; and as she now had reached a proper age, I

<P>The inscrutable designs of Providence have will|ed it otherwise&mdash;Once, on a festival in honour of our guardian saint, the villagers proceeded early to the abbey leaving behind them only the old men. To my daughter too, I granted permission to accompany her friends, as I myself was unable to attend her. The neighboring Van+dals had waited for this moment, when all our strength was absent. They fell upon our village, where not more than fifty persons were left, plundered our dwellings, drove away our cattle, and took the old men prisoners who had staid behind&mdash;among the rest myself. Eight years past away. I was a slave among the heathens&mdash;my daughter dead to me, and I to her. But this morning&mdash; (Oh! why have I survived it?)&mdash;but this fatal morning I was released from bondage by your son. I came, and found your daughter&mdash;in the arms of her bro|ther.</P>

<SPEAKER>Hu.</SPEAKER>
<P>My son, more than three hundred years are passed away, since Hans of Wulfingen built this castle. He was the first of all our race, whose own valour girded on his loins the sword of knighthood. Our emperor, Conrad the first, dubbed him in the year nine hundred and twelve, upon the very field, where he had shed his blood, in fight|ing for his native country against Hungary. He married Wul&s;hild of Sickingen, and from love towards her, he called this castle Wulfingen. He was slain in a quarrel for an image of Saint Paul, which his attendants had se|cretly suffered to be stolen. This, his son,
<STAGE>(pointing to the second picture)</STAGE>
Egbert of Wulfingen, was accused of having murdered one Count Baldwin. The sacred tribu|nal before which he was tried, obliged him to attest his in|nocence
<PB N="40" REF="037744_0040_100EFD074AB5E5C8">
by the sword, He was slain, but his last breath affirmed the accusation to be false and villainous.
<STAGE>(<HI>Point|ing to the third picture</HI>)</STAGE>
his son, Maximilian of Wulfin|gen asserted, at some jovial banquet, that the image of the Virgin Mary, which worked miracles at Emmerick, was a pious fraud. He was in consequence, secretly assassi|nated by the instigation of the monks&mdash; <STAGE>(pointing to the fourth picture)</STAGE>
His son Henry of Wulfingen, not profit|ing by the example of his father, dared to utter some un|meaning words against the pope's authority, was subject|ed to the ban, and forsaken by his friends, died broken-hearted.
<STAGE>(<HI>pointing to the fifth picture</HI>)</STAGE>
His son Albert of Wulfingen, fearful and weak from the example of his fa|thers, and the education of a monk, gave half his fortune to the cloisters, endowed the church with many of his best demesnes, died with a relique in his hand, and was almost cannonized&mdash; <STAGE>(<HI>pointing to the sixth picture</HI>)</STAGE>
His son Her|man of Wulfingen, went on an excursion to convert the heathens to our christian faith. His heart betrayed him. He became attached to a fair heathen, and was compelled to leave her, because she continued faithful to the idola|try of her forefathers. He married Maria of Simmern, who bore one son, but ill supplied to him the place of the good heathen. He arrived at a discontented old age, and died.
<STAGE>(<HI>pointing to the seventh picture</HI>)</STAGE>
My grandfather, Otto, of Wulfingen, from some long smothered resent|ment, was assaulted by three villains of the house of Lein|engen, as he was returning, somewhat weary, from the chace. They slew him, and took refuge in a Benedictine cloister, where, for a sum of money, they were pardoned in the name of God, and not a mortal dared to bring an accusation.
<STAGE>(<HI>pointing to the eighth picture</HI>)</STAGE>
My father, Francis, of Wulfingen, wishing to revenge his father's death, and enraged in a just cause, struck a lay brother of the Benedictines, was subjected to the ban, excommunica|ted, and died in misery. Well can I recollect the grief of my poor mother! But of that no more. I myself, my son, I myself have completed this number of unhappy be|ings, whom superstition has plunged into destruction.&mdash; I am not ashamed to tell thee, that for one moment, I have been a villain&mdash;and what man is without such mo|ments? One only wicked deed has been to me the source
<PB N="41" REF="037744_0041_100EFD08CFB46A90">
of endless agony. Thy mother was a good woman, though beauty was not her inheritance. She loved me while I was but her friend. It was not in my power to press her with ardour to my bosom. For her I seldom felt desire, and often avoided her embraces. Whether she were ever conscious of what passed within me, I am ignorant. She herself, (God reward her for it) she herself never uttered one harsh word to me, never received me with a frown, and <HI>forced</HI> from me, my whole respect. Bint this was all&mdash; My love&mdash; <STAGE>(stammers)</STAGE>
I must disclose it as a warning to my son&mdash;my love was oft bestowed on prostitutes, and every woman but my wife, inflamed my passions.&mdash; Once, on a parching summer's day, I met a lovely crea|ture in the field. Her name was Rosamond. She was an orphan. She had nothing left in this wide world, ex|cept her honour&mdash;and of that I robb'd her&mdash;Thou start'st, thou shuddrest&mdash;Right, my son. Let this moment never be eras'd from thy remembrance&mdash;Heaven is my witness I had ever been an upright man&mdash;except in this one in|stance. Dost thou see the tear that starts into my eye? Of these I have shed millions, yet each still scalds my soul as if it were the first. The poor creature bore a girl in secret and expired. I entrusted the unhappy fruit of my transgression to an honest boor, whose wife had lately been delivered of a dead child. He swore eternal secresy, and reared the forsaken being as his own daugh|ter&mdash;My peace of mind was gone. In motion, or on my pillow, the palid image of my Rosamond was floating in my sight. In motion or on my pillow, her dying groans assailed my ear. To regain tranquility I vowed an expe|dition to the holy land against the Saracens, forsook my wife, my child, and country, to follow our emperor Fre|derick, the Red-beard, and in the name of God, to mur|der men, who never had offended me. Oft as I plunged my sword into the vitals of a Saracen, I fancied that his blood would cleanse me from my sin. In vain! I writh|ed myself, in anguish, on the holy tomb. In vain! I im|posed severe penance on myself, and went through many a weary pilgrimage. In vain! nor scourge nor absolu|tion, could avail to cure the viperous sting of conscience &mdash;At length I was dangerously wounded in a skirmish,
<PB N="42" REF="037744_0042_100EFD0AF1148788">
and taken prisoner by the sultan of Babylon. There, for twenty years, I languished in the fetters of the infidels, till at last, with other knights, I was ransomed by the em|peror of the Greeks. Weary of a delusive world, full of anxious wishes to behold my family and home, I took a pilgrim's staff, and am this day returned&mdash;I find my wife no more, and my daughter

<P>Emblem of virtue! You misunderstand me. Methought that to us both the time seemed long, and therefore my wink. The knights are sitting with full goblets, and relating tales of chivalry and war.

<P>Did you observe how my boys, with open mouths, hung on Sir Hugo's words? Did you observe, how my spindle even sometimes fell upon my lap, when he recounted, in such admirable terms, his feats among the Saracens? I attend with rapture to such dangerous ex|ploits, when related by a humble knight, I feel a pleasure in the pain. I hold my breath, and listen to his every syllable.

<P>In vain does the stern sense of duty exact the murder of these sweet innocents. They are the fruit of infamy, an abomination both to God and man. Look! ye inexorable judges, look at this guiltless smiling face&mdash; In truth, if Satan be concealed behind this mask, no won|der he so easily seduces saints. This child has robb'd another of an egg. This is the heaviest transgression&punc; and he heartily repents it.</P>

Woe be upon me! What am I about to do? Some infernal spirit is trying to delude me&mdash;is trying to rob me of my last and only con|solation&mdash;happiness hereafter. 'Till now I have been ig|norant, and the mercy of my judge will pardon me. But the next embrace must be eternal death&mdash;In vain does the tempter whisper to me: "'Tis but fraternal love. A sister sure may clasp a brother to her heart." Begone, ye lures to sin!&mdash;I cannot command my heart. 'Tis the heart of a fond loving wife&mdash;a sister's love is foreign to it. &mdash;God has passed his heaviest denunciation upon incest. &mdash;Did not the abbot say this?&mdash;Did he not curse me and my children?&mdash;Did not the holy Virgin arm me by a miracle?&mdash;Was it not the finger of the Highest, which pointed to the sacrifice, ordained to be offered to him by my hands?&mdash;Oh temporal and eternal welfare of my chil|dren, the most sacred of a mother's cares, what will be|come of you, if, in this hour my strength forsakes me?&mdash; Come nearer, my pretty ones.
