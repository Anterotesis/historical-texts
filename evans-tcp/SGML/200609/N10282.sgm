<P>NOTHING gives more convincing proof of deficiency in judgment or malevo|lence of heart in an Author, than general, undi&s;tingui&s;hing &s;atire, levelled at an order of men, at a &s;ex, or at human nature. Mo&s;t writers, who have taken the Fair Sex as their &s;ubject, have treated them without proper di&s;|tinction, and either deified them without ex|ceptions, or condemned them without mercy; and &s;carcely have the Ladies been more ex|po&s;ed by ridiculous flattery, than injured by unde&s;erved cen&s;ure. The Roman Poet, <HI>Ju|venal,</HI> who gave the lead to the&s;e Lampooners, hath railed at the Sex in a very long &s;atire, the mo&s;t witty and injudicious of all his pro|ductions. The E&s;&s;ay on the Characters of Women by <HI>Pope,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the capri|cious prai&s;es of his whim&s;ical Editor, is one of his lea&s;t meritorious performances, and was ju&s;tly received with coldne&s;s by the public. <HI>Swift,</HI> tho' he hath &s;hown far greater know|lege of human nature, hath deba&s;ed all his
<PB N="vi" REF="013052_0004_0F8FF5F9D5ED3090">
&s;atires on the Ladies, by the mo&s;t general a&s;|per&s;ions and dirty raillery. <HI>Young,</HI> inferior perhaps to the two la&s;t in genius, hath di&s;play|ed much more judgment and true wit on the&s;e &s;ubjects. His &s;atires I would recommend to the peru&s;al of my fair readers, as the reproofs and corrections of a friend. The man, who only in&s;ults over vice and folly, without &s;hew|ing their cau&s;es, or pointing out the remedy, employs his pen to very little purpo&s;e: like a phy&s;ician, who &s;hould prove you had a mor|tal di&s;ea&s;e, and yet through malice or igno|rance &s;hould refu&s;e a pre&s;cription.</P>
<P>My de&s;ign in this Poem is to &s;hew, that all the foibles we di&s;cover in the Fair Sex ari&s;e principally from the neglect of their educati|on, and the mi&s;taken notions they imbibe in their early youth. This naturally introduced a de&s;cription of the&s;e foibles, which I have endeavoured to laugh at with good humour, and to expo&s;e without malevolence. Had I only con&s;ulted my own ta&s;te, I would have preferred &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit with a &s;tyle more e|levated and poetical, to a perpetual drollery, and the affectation of wit: but I have found by experience in the &s;econd part of this work, that it is not &s;o agreeable to the bulk of my readers; and I wi&s;hed in the la&s;t production I &s;hall probably offer the public to have the good fortune of general approbation. I have endeavoured to avoid un&s;ea&s;onable &s;eve|rity, and hope, in that point, I am pretty clear of cen&s;ure; e&s;pecially as &s;ome of my good friends in the&s;e parts have lately made
<PB N="vii" REF="013052_0005_0F8FF5FA9C2B8470">
a di&s;covery that &s;everity is not my talent, and there is nothing to be feared from the &s;trokes of my &s;atire; a di&s;covery, that on this head hath given me no &s;mall con&s;olation. In the following poem, my de&s;ign is &s;o apparent, that I am not much afraid of general mi&s;re|pre&s;entation; and I hope there are no grave folks, who will think it trifling or unimpor|tant. I expect however, from the treatment I have already received in regard to the for|mer parts of this work, as well as &s;ome later and more fugitive productions, that my de|&s;igns will by many be ignorantly or wilfully mi&s;under&s;tood. I &s;hall re&s;t &s;atisfied with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that a de&s;ire to promote the in|tere&s;ts of learning and morality was the prin|cipal motive, that influenced me in the&s;e writ|ings; judging as I did, that unle&s;s I attempt|ed &s;omething in this way, that might conduce to the &s;ervice of mankind, I had &s;pent much time in the &s;tudies of the Mu&s;es in vain.</P>
<P>Polite literature hath within a few years made very con&s;iderable advances in <HI>America.</HI> Mankind in general &s;eem &s;en&s;ible of the im|portance and advantages of learning. Female Education hath been mo&s;t neglected; and I wi&s;h this &s;mall performance may have &s;ome tendency to encourage and promote it. The &s;prightline&s;s of Female genius, and the excel|lence of that Sex in their proper walks of &s;ci|ence are by no means inferior to the accom|pli&s;hments of Men. And although the cour&s;e of their education ought to be different, and writing is not &s;o peculiarly the bu&s;ine&s;s of the
<PB N="viii" REF="013052_0006_0F8FF5FB51729D20">
&s;ex, yet I cannot but hope hereafter to &s;ee the accompli&s;hment of my prediction in their favor.</P>
<L>Her Daughters too this happy land &s;hall grace</L>
<L>With pow'rs of genius, as with charms of face:</L>
<L>Ble&s;t with the &s;oftne&s;s of the female mind,</L>

<L>That wrinkles at her in her gla&s;s:</L>
<L>So <HI>Satan,</HI> in the monk's tradition,</L>
<L>Fear'd, when he met his apparition.</L>
<L>At length her name each Coxcomb cancels</L>
<L>From &s;tanding li&s;ts of toa&s;ts and angels;</L>
<L>And &s;lighted where &s;he &s;hone before,</L>
<L>A grace and godde&s;s now no more,</L>
<L>Depriv'd of long-accu&s;tom'd plea&s;ure</L>
<L>In daily fal&s;hoods told to prai&s;e her;</L>
<L>De&s;pis'd by all, and doom'd to meet</L>
<L>Her lovers at her rival's feet,</L>
<L>She flies a&s;&s;emblies, &s;huns the ball,</L>
<L>And cries out, Vanity, on all;</L>
<L>Affects to &s;corn the tin&s;el-&s;hows</L>
<L>Of glittring Belles and gaudy Beaus;</L>
<L>Nor longer hopes to hide by dre&s;s</L>
<L>The tracks of age upon her face.</L>

<L>Who fond, they heard, of &s;acred truth,</L>

<L>Grown fit forth mini&s;terial union,</L>
<L>And grave, as <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI>'s wife in <HI>Bunyan.</HI></L>
<L>On this he rigg'd him in his be&s;t,</L>
<L>And got his old grey wig new-dre&s;t,</L>
<L>Fix'd on his &s;uit of &s;able &s;tuffs,</L>
<L>And bru&s;h'd the powder from the cuffs,</L>
<L>With black &s;ilk &s;tockings, yet in being,</L>
