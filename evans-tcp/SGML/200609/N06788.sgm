<OPENER><SALUTE>TO THE READER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>AS my Capacities and Condition of Life are very low, it cannot be expected that I &s;hould make tho&s;e Remarks on the Sufferings I have met with, or the kind Providence of a good GOD for my Pre&s;er|vation, as one in a higher Station; but &s;hall leave that to the Reader as he goes along, and &s;o I &s;hall only relate Matters of Fact as they occur to my Mind&mdash;</HI></P>
<P>ON Monday, 25th Day of <HI>December,</HI> 1747, with the leave of my Ma&s;ter, I went from <HI>Mar&s;hfield,</HI> with an Inten|tion to go a Voyage to Sea, and the next Day, the 26th, got to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> where I immediately &s;hip'd my&s;elf on board of a Sloop, Capt. <HI>John Howland,</HI> Ma&s;ter, bound to <HI>Jamaica</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="008611_0003_102F98D11A1AF008">
and the <HI>Bay</HI>&mdash;We &s;ailed from <HI>Plymouth</HI> in a &s;hort Time, and after a plea&s;ant Pa&s;&s;age of about 30 Days, arrived at <HI>Jamaica;</HI> we was detain'd at <HI>Jamaica</HI> only 5 Days, from whence we &s;ailed for the Bay, where we arrived &s;afe in 10 Days. We loaded our Ve&s;&s;el with Logwood, and &s;ailed from the <HI>Bay</HI> the 25th Day of <HI>May</HI> following, and the 15th Day of <HI>June,</HI> we were ca&s;t away on <HI>Cape-Florida,</HI> about 5 Leagues from the Shore; being now de&s;titute of every Help, we knew not what to do or what Cour&s;e to take in this our &s;ad Condition:&mdash;The Captain was ad|vi&s;ed, intreated, and beg'd on, by every Per&s;on on board, to heave over but only 20 Ton of the <HI>Wood,</HI> and we &s;hould get clear, which if he had done, might have &s;av'd his Ve&s;&s;el and Cargo, and not only &s;o, but his own Life, as well as the Lives of the Mate and Nine Hands, as I &s;hall pre&s;ently relate.</P>
<P>After being upon this Reef two Days, the Captain order'd the Boat to be hoi&s;ted out, and then a&s;k'd who were willing to tarry on board? The whole Crew was for going on Shore at this Time, but as the Boat would not carry 12 Per|&s;ons at once, and to prevent any Unea&s;ine&s;s, the Captain, a Pa&s;&s;enger, and one Hand tarry'd on board, while the Mate, with Seven Hands be|&s;ides my&s;elf, were order'd to go on Shore in the Boat, which as &s;oon as we had reached, one half
<PB N="5" REF="008611_0004_102F98D2AB0BA358">
were to be Landed, and the other four to return to the Sloop, to fetch the Captain and the others on Shore. The Captain order'd us to take with us our Arms, Ammunition, Provi&s;ions and Nece&s;&s;aries for Cooking, as al&s;o a Sail to make a Tent of, to &s;helter us from the Weather; after having left the Sloop we &s;tood towards the Shore, and being within Two Leagues of the &s;ame, we e&s;py'd a Number of Canoes, which we at fir&s;t took to be Rocks, but &s;oon found our Mi&s;take, for we perceiv'd they moved towards us; we pre&s;ently &s;aw an Engli&s;h Colour hoi&s;ted in one of the Canoes, at the Sight of which we were not a little rejoiced, but on our advancing yet nearer, we found them, to our very great Surprize, to be <HI>Indians</HI> of which there were Sixty; being now &s;o near them we could not po&s;&s;ibly make our E&s;cape; they &s;oon came up with and boarded us, took away all our Arms Ammunition, and Provi&s;ion. The whole Number of Canoes (being about Twenty,) then made for the Sloop, except Two which they left to guard us, who order'd us to follow on with them; the Eighteen which made for the Sloop, went &s;o much fa&s;ter than we that they got on board a|bove Three Hours before we came along &s;ide, and had kill'd Captain <HI>Howland,</HI> the Pa&s;&s;enger and the other hand; we came to the Larboard &s;ide of the Sloop, and they order'd us round to the Starboard, and as we were pa&s;&s;ing round the
<PB N="6" REF="008611_0005_102F98D446E09AD8">
Bow, we &s;aw the whole Number of <HI>Indians,</HI> advancing forward and loading their Guns, upon which the Mate &s;aid, "<HI>my Lads we are all dead Men,</HI>" and before we had got round, they di&s;charged their Small Arms upon us, and kill'd Three of our hands, viz. <HI>Reuben Young</HI> of <HI>Cape-Cod,</HI> Mate; <HI>Jo&s;eph Little</HI> and <HI>Lemuel Doty</HI> of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> upon which I immediately jump'd overboard, chu&s;ing rather to be drowned, than to be kill'd by tho&s;e barbarous and inhuman Sa|vages. In three or four Minutes after, I heard another Volley which di&s;patched the other five, viz. <HI>John Nowland,</HI> and <HI>Nathaniel Rich,</HI> both belonging to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> and <HI>Elkanah Collymore,</HI> and <HI>James Webb,</HI> Strangers, and <HI>Mo&s;es New|mock,</HI> Molatto. As &s;oon as they had kill'd the whole of the People, one of the Canoes padled after me, and &s;oon came up with me, hawled me into the Canoe, and beat me mo&s;t terribly with a Cutla&s;s, after that they ty'd me down, then this Canoe &s;tood for the Sloop again and as &s;oon as &s;he came along &s;ide, the <HI>Indians</HI> on board the Sloop betook them&s;elves to their Canoes, then &s;et the Ve&s;&s;el on Fire, making a prodigious &s;houting and hallowing like &s;o many Devils. As &s;oon as the Ve&s;&s;el was burnt down to the Water's edge, the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;tood for the Shore, together with our Boat, on board of which they put 5 hands. After we came to the Shore, they led me to their Hutts, where I expected nothing but im|mediate

Death, and as they &s;poke broken Engli&s;h, were often telling me, while coming from the Sloop to the Shore, that they intended to roa&s;t me alive. But the Providence of God order'd it otherways, for He appeared for my Help, <HI>in this Mount of Difficulty,</HI> and they were better to me then my Fears, and &s;oon unbound me, but &s;et a Guard over me every Night. They kept me with them about five Weeks, during which Time they us'd me pretty well, and gave me boil'd Corn, which was what they often eat them&s;elves. The Way I made my E&s;cape from the&s;e Villains was this; A Spani&s;h Schooner arriving there from <HI>St. Augu&s;tine,</HI> the Ma&s;ter of which, who&s;e Name was <HI>Romond,</HI> a&s;ked the <HI>In|dians</HI> to let me go on board his Ve&s;&s;el, which they granted, and the Captain <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Way I came to know this Gentleman was, by his being taken la&s;t War by an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Privateer, and brought into <HI>Jamaica,</HI> while I was there.</NOTE> knowing me very well, weigh'd Anchor and carry'd me off to the <HI>Havanna,</HI> and after being there four Days the <HI>Indians</HI> came after me, and in&s;i&s;ted on having me again, as I was their Pri&s;oner;&mdash;They made Application to the Governor, and demand|ed me again from him; in an&s;wer to which the Governor told them, that as they had put the whole Crew to Death, they &s;hould not have me again, and &s;o paid them Ten Dollars for me, adding, that he would not have them kill any Per|&s;on
<PB N="8" REF="008611_0007_102F98DD27688810">
hereafter, but take as many of them as they could, of tho&s;e that &s;hould be ca&s;t away, and bring them to him, for which he would pay them Ten Dollars a-head. At the <HI>Havanna</HI> I lived with the Governor in the Ca&s;tle about a Twelve|month, where I was walking thro' the Street, I met with a Pre&s;s-Gang who immediately pre&s;t me, and put me into Goal, and with a Number of others I was confin'd till next Morning, when we were all brought out, and a&s;k'd who would go on board the King's Ships, four of which having been lately built, were bound to <HI>Old-Spain,</HI> and on my refu&s;ing to &s;erve on board, they put me in a clo&s;e Dungeon, where I was confin'd <HI>Four Years and &s;even months</HI>; during which Time I often made application to the Governor, by Per&s;ons who came to &s;ee the Pri|&s;oners, but they never acquainted him with it, nor did he know all this Time what became of me, which was the means of my being confin'd there &s;o long. But kind Providence &s;o order'd it, that after I had been in this Place &s;o long as the Time mention'd above the Captain of a Merchantman, belonging to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> having &s;prung a Leak was obliged to put into the <HI>Havanna</HI> to refit, and while he was at Dinner at Mrs. <HI>Betty Howard's,</HI> &s;he told the Captain of my deplorable Condi|tion, and &s;aid &s;he would be glad, if he could by &s;ome means or other relieve me; The Captain
<PB N="9" REF="008611_0008_102F98DEC285EB78">
told Mrs. <HI>Howard</HI> he would u&s;e his be&s;t Endea|vours for my Relief and Enlargement.</P>
<P>Accordingly, after Dinner, came to the Pri&s;on, and a&s;k'd the Keeper if he might &s;ee me; upon his Reque&s;t I was brought out of the Dungeon, and after the Captain had Interrogated me, told me, he would intercede with the Governor for my Relief out of that mi&s;erable Place, which he did, and the next Day the Governor &s;ent an Order to relea&s;e me; I lived with the Governor about a Year after I was delivered from the Dun|geon, in which Time I endeavour'd three Times to make my E&s;cape, the la&s;t of which proved effectual; the fir&s;t Time I got on board of Captain <HI>Mar&s;h,</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Twenty Gun Ship, with a Number of others, and lay on board conceal'd that Night; and the next Day the Ship being under &s;ail, I thought my&s;elf &s;afe, and &s;o made my Appearance upon Deck, but as &s;oon as we were di&s;covered the Captain order|ed the Boat out, and &s;ent us all on Shore&mdash; I intreated the Captain to let me, in particular, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">arry on board, begging, and crying to him, to commi&s;erate my unhappy Condition, and ad|ded, that I had been confin'd almo&s;t five Years in a clo&s;e Dungeon, but the Captain would not hearken to any Intreaties, for fear of having the Governor's Di&s;plea&s;ure, and &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> was obliged to go on Shore,</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="008611_0009_102F98E218D87558">After being on Shore another Twelvemonth, I endeavour'd to make my E&s;cape the &s;econd Time, by trying to get on board of a Sloop bound to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and as I was going from the City to the Sloop, was unhappily taken by the Guard, and ordered back to the Ca&s;tle, and there confined.&mdash;However, in a &s;hort Time I was &s;et at Liberty, ond order'd with a Number of others to carry the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He is carried (by Way of Re&s;pect) in a large Two-arm Chair; the Chair is lin'd with crim&s;on Velvet, and &s;upported by eight Per&s;ons.</NOTE> <HI>Bi&s;hop</HI> from the Ca&s;tle, thro' the Country, to confirm the old People, baptize Children, &amp;c. for which he receives large Sums of Money.&mdash; I was employ'd in this Service about Seven Months, during which Time I lived very well, and then returned to the Ca&s;tle again, where I had my Liberty to walk about the City, and do Work for my &s;elf;&mdash;The <HI>Beaver,</HI> an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Man of War then lay in the Harbour, and having been informed by &s;ome of the Ship's Crew that &s;he was to &s;ail in a few Days, I had nothing now to do, but to &s;eek an Opportunity how I &s;hould make my E&s;cape.</P>
<P>Accordingly one Sunday Night the Lieu|tenant of the Ship with a Number of the Barge Crew were in a Tavern, and Mrs. <HI>Howard</HI> who had before been a Friend to me, inter|ceded
<PB N="11" REF="008611_0010_102F98E7CA9AD800">
with the Lieutenant to carry me on board: the Lieutenant &s;aid he would with all his Heart, and immediately I went on board in the Barge. The next Day the <HI>Spaniards</HI> came along &s;ide the <HI>Beaver,</HI> and demanded me again, with a Number of others who had made their E&s;cape from them, and got on board the Ship, but ju&s;t before I did; but the Captain, who was a true <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> refus'd them, and &s;aid he could not an&s;wer it, to deliver up any <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> under <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colours.&mdash;In a few Days we &s;et Sail for <HI>Jamaica,</HI> where we arrived &s;afe, after a &s;hort and plea&s;ant Pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>After being at <HI>Jamaica</HI> a &s;hort Time we &s;ail'd for <HI>London,</HI> as convoy to a Fleet of Mer|chantmen, who all arrived &s;afe in the <HI>Downs,</HI> I was turned over to another Ship, the <HI>Arcen|ceil,</HI> and there remained about a Month. From this Ship I went on board the <HI>Sandwich</HI> of 90 Guns; on board the <HI>Sandwich,</HI> I tarry'd 6 Weeks, and then was order'd on board the <HI>Hercules,</HI> Capt. <HI>John Porter,</HI> a 74 Gun Ship, we &s;ail'd on a Cruize, and met with a <HI>French</HI> 84 Gun Ship, and had a very &s;mart Engage|ment, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A particular Account of this Engagement, has been Publi&s;h'd in the <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> New-Papers.</NOTE> in which about 70 of our Hands were Kill'd and Wounded, the Captain lo&s;t his Leg
<PB N="12" REF="008611_0011_102F98EAE5A81B30">
in the Engagement, and I was Wounded in the Head by a &s;mall Shot. We &s;hould have taken this Ship, if they had not cut away the mo&s;t of our Rigging; however, in about three Hours after, a 64 Gun Ship, came up with and took her.&mdash;I was di&s;charged from the <HI>Hercules</HI> the 12th Day of <HI>May</HI> 1759 (having been on board of that Ship 3 Months) on account of my being di&s;abled in the Arm, and render'd inca|pable of Service, after being honourably paid the Wages due to me. I was put into the <HI>Greenwich</HI> Ho&s;pital where I &s;tay'd and &s;oon recovered.&mdash;I then &s;hip'd my&s;elf a Cook on board Captain <HI>Martyn,</HI> an arm'd Ship in the King's Service. I was on board this Ship al|mo&s;t Two Months, and after being paid my Wages, was di&s;charg'd in the Month of <HI>October.</HI> &mdash;After my di&s;charge from Captain <HI>Martyn,</HI> I was taken &s;ick in <HI>London</HI> of a Fever, and was confin'd about 6 Weeks, where I expended all my Money, and left in very poor Circum&s;tances; and unhappy for me I knew nothing of my <HI>good Ma&s;ter's</HI> being in <HI>London</HI> at this my very difficult Time. After I got well of my &s;ick|ne&s;s, I &s;hip'd my&s;elf on board of a large Ship bound to <HI>Guinea,</HI> and being in a publick Hou&s;e one Evening, I overheard a Number of Per&s;ons talking about Rigging a Ve&s;&s;el bound to <HI>New-England,</HI> I a&s;k'd them to what Part of <HI>New-England</HI> this Ve&s;&s;el was bound? they told me,
<PB N="13" REF="008611_0012_102F98EC713AD438">
to <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI>; and having a&s;k'd them who was Commander? they told me, Capt. <HI>Watt</HI>; in a few Minutes after this the Mate of the Ship came in, and I a&s;k'd him if Captain <HI>Watt</HI> did not want a Cook, who told me he did, and that the Captain would be in, in a few Minutes; and in about half an Hour the Cap|tain came in, and then I &s;hip'd my&s;elf at once, after begging off from the Ship bound to <HI>Guinea;</HI> I work'd on board Captain <HI>Watt's</HI> Ship almo&s;t Three Months, before &s;he &s;ail'd, and one Day being at Work in the Hold, I overheard &s;ome Per&s;ons on board mention the Name of <HI>Win&s;low,</HI> at the Name of which I was very inqui&s;itive, and having a&s;k'd what <HI>Win&s;low</HI> they were talking about? They told me it was <HI>General Win&s;low;</HI> and that he was one of the Pa&s;&s;engers, I a&s;k'd them what <HI>General Win&s;low</HI>? For I never knew <HI>my good Ma&s;ter,</HI> by that Title before; but after enquiring more particularly I found it mu&s;t be <HI>Ma&s;ter,</HI> and in a few Days Time the Truth was joyfully verify'd by a happy Sight of his Per&s;on, which &s;o overcome me, that I could not &s;peak to him for &s;ome Time&mdash;<HI>My good Ma&s;ter</HI> was exceeding glad to &s;ee me, telling me that I was like one aro&s;e from the Dead, for he thought I had been Dead a great many Years, having heard nothing of me for almo&s;t Thirteen Years.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="008611_0013_102F98EFCD435ED8">I think I have not deviated from Truth, in any particular of this my Narrative, and tho' I have omitted a great many Things, yet what is wrote may &s;uffice to convince the Reader, that I have been mo&s;t grievou&s;ly afflicted, and yet thro' the Divine Goodne&s;s, as miraculou&s;ly pre&s;erved, and delivered out of many Dangers; of which I de&s;ire to retain a <HI>grateful Remembrance,</HI> as long as I live in the World.</P>
<P><HI>And now, That in the Providence of that GOD, who delivered his Servant</HI> David out of the Paw of the Lion and out of the Paw of the Bear, <HI>I am freed from a</HI> long <HI>and</HI> dread|ful Captivity, among wor&s;e Savages than they; <HI>And am return'd to my</HI> own Native Land, to Shew how Great Things the Lord hoth done for Me; <HI>I would call upon all Men, and Say,</HI> O Magnifie the Lord with Me, and let us Exalt his Name together!&mdash; O that Men would Prai&s;e the Lord for His Goodne&s;s, and for his Wonderful Works to the Children of Men!</P>
