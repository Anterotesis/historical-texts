<Q>I AM DISTRESSED FOR THEE, MY BROTHER&mdash;VERY PLEASANT HAST THOU BEEN UN|TO ME.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>ONCE more, my beloved and mourning friends of this Chri&s;tian Society, once more <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the afternoon of the Lord's-day preceding the delivery of this di&s;cour&s;e, Dr. CLARKE was preaching to his people from P&s;alm xxii. 3. and in the mid&s;t of his di&s;cour&s;e was &s;eized with an apoplectic fit, which terminated in his death at three o'clock the next morning. The body was brought into the church on this occa&s;ion.</NOTE> are you called to vi&s;it the hou&s;e of prayer. When la&s;t you trod its courts, your de|votions were led and your minds elevated and in|&s;tructed by the amiable and excellent man who&s;e remains now lie before us. Then too you wit|ne&s;&s;ed the arre&s;t of the king of terrors upon him; and while the pulpit was his dying bed, you &s;ur|rounded it and wept bitterly over him!</P>
<P>Now&mdash;another melancholy duty is to be per|formed. We are to commit the &s;acred remains to the &s;ilent grave, and leave them there, not again to return "till the heavens be no more." We have vi&s;ited the hou&s;e of prayer in our way to the hou&s;e of death, not merely to &s;hew our re&s;pect to him, but recal to our minds tho&s;e con&s;iderations of
<PB N="6" REF="034642_0004_0FFF4370B48A7080">
rea&s;on and religion which are alone competent to &s;upport them under &s;uch trying &s;cenes. Now, then, recollect how often you have heard him from this &s;acred de&s;k, expatiate with ardor on the per|fect wi&s;dom and unbounded goodne&s;s of the Deity, and &s;hew the fitne&s;s and propriety of an ab&s;olute &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the divine will, a full confidence in the divine mercy. Recollect the&s;e things, my brethren, and you will hear him comforting you as it were for his own lo&s;s, charging you not to of|fend God by complaining of his ways, or indulging to exce&s;&s;ive grief.</P>
<P>You &s;urely can adopt the language of David in the text, where he laments the death of Jonathan, the friend and brother of his &s;oul. Their friend|&s;hip commenced in early life, and was cemented by numerous in&s;tances of kind and faithful attention. The cruelty and inju&s;tice of Saul could not di&s;&s;olve it, nor induce Jonathan to for&s;ake the man whom he e&s;teemed with rea&s;on and loved with warmth. When therefore he &s;uddenly fell by the hands of his enemies, the &s;weet P&s;almi&s;t embalms his mem|ory with tears, and over his untimely grave recites the melancholy but plea&s;ing ode from which the text is taken. Let us con&s;ider its meaning and de|&s;ign, and endeavor to find the con&s;olation which our pre&s;ent circum&s;tances demand, and religion, the religion of Chri&s;t alone, can furni&s;h.</P>
<P>DEEPLY are we di&s;tre&s;&s;ed when it plea&s;es God to take from us tho&s;e whom we highly love and e&s;teem. Death is at all times awful. God has been plea&s;ed for wise purpo&s;es, to implant a dread of it in human nature. When we witne&s;s its
<PB N="7" REF="034642_0005_0FFF43723AC62C50">
ravages upon &s;trangers, upon tho&s;e with whom we have no immediate connexion, we feet a &s;hud|dering horror. But how much more deeply are we affected when it comes near to us, when it di&s;|&s;olves the tendere&s;t connexions, when it takes away tho&s;e who were our guides, our friends, our &s;tay and &s;taff; when it cuts down the u&s;eful, the learned, the wi&s;e and the good, to whom we were tenderly attached, and from whom we expected that we and our children &s;hould derive much ben|efit. This is indeed the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing ingredient in the bitter cup.</P>
<P>SUCH was the virtuous and good character of Jonathan as that David was not di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with any anxiety or apprehen&s;ion as to his happine&s;s in a future &s;tate. Of this he could have no doubt. His tears were a tribute to the holy, ardent friend&s;hip which he bore to this excellent young man. They flowed becau&s;e his friend fell in battle before his enemies; becau&s;e "the beauty of I&s;rael was &s;lain upon the high places;" becau&s;e he could not vi&s;it and &s;upport and mini&s;ter to him in his la&s;t mo|ments, and becau&s;e death had put a period to their friend&s;hip in this world forever.</P>
<P>Now, we are di&s;tre&s;&s;ed for the lo&s;s of our pious friends, not becau&s;e we have any doubts of their felicity; not becau&s;e we he&s;itate in believing that they are far happier than this world can make them, nor becau&s;e we &s;cruple the right which God has to take them away, or his wi&s;dom and good|ne&s;s in doing &s;o: But, we mourn becau&s;e we loved them while they lived, and they are gone away forever; becau&s;e we have lo&s;t the benefit of their
<PB N="8" REF="034642_0006_0FFF4373CBABBF48">
prayers, their coun&s;els, their &s;weet and amiable con|ver&s;ation; and becau&s;e a connexion which formed the &s;olace of our lives is di&s;&s;olved. We do not "weep for them:" We "weep for our&s;elves and our children." Their deaths occa&s;ion a lo&s;s to us, but to them they afford un&s;peakable gain. They are placed &s;afely beyond the reach of all the trials, the temptations and &s;orrows of life; while we &s;till navigate its &s;tormy &s;ea and encounter all its dan|gers. Their characters are fixed and determined. There is no danger of their forfeiting them; while we are taught to "fear always," and di&s;tru&s;t our own re&s;olutions. Their work is ended. Their warfare is accompli&s;hed. Their race is run. But we are &s;till toiling in the conflict, and may fall by the hands of our enemies. Surely then, "the day of death is better than the day of one's birth."</P>
<P>WHEN we are di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with the lo&s;s of our dear and re&s;pected friends, let us "comfort one another with the&s;e words." Let us remember that they are gone to a glory beyond our conception; that they have a&s;cended to "their Father and our Father, to their God and our God;" that their triumph is begun, and &s;hall endure forever. Let us remem|ber that they have lived &s;o long as God &s;aw to be be&s;t for them and for us; that he who cannot err has ordered every event concerning them; and that "though they cannot come to us, yet that we &s;hall go to them."</P>
<P>IN proportion as our friends were plea&s;ant and agreeable to us in their lives, are we affected and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by their deaths. We can &s;ee the weak, the wicked and the worthle&s;s leave the world, and
<PB N="9" REF="034642_0007_0FFF437A67C95D20">
feel &s;omething more than re&s;ignation: But when we &s;ee virtuous and good men, who were tenderly beloved and eminently u&s;eful, taken away in the mid&s;t of their days, then are "the ways of Heaven dark and intricate," and then are our faith and patience tried.</P>
<P>THERE are many circum&s;tances which render men plea&s;ant to us, or amiable in our view. We may know that every thing excellent in them "comes down from the Father of Lights:" But &s;till we cannot avoid e&s;teeming and loving them, becau&s;e what God has given them becomes a part of them&s;elves, and becau&s;e they improve well the advantages with which they are favored.</P>
<P>How natural is it for us to honor and love tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s a mild, affectionate and benevo|lent natural temper; who &s;eem to have no gall in their con&s;titution; who, without &s;upplene&s;s or cringing &s;ervility, prove by their deportment that they feel malevolence to none, but wi&s;h to make all about them happy. When &s;uch a temper is joined with &s;trong and vigorous faculties of mind, faculties which render the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or &s;uperior to the greater part of mankind, and qualify him for emi|nent u&s;efulne&s;s, then we adore the goodne&s;s of God towards him, and then we take delight in his ac|quaintance.</P>
<P>IN dome&s;tic life, where our character appear mo&s;t truly and without di&s;gui&s;e, who does not love the dutiful &s;on, the tender hu&s;band, the wi&s;e and affectionate parent, and the kind ma&s;ter? When we &s;ee a man walking through this &s;eque&s;tered path of life, with true goodne&s;s in his heart, and
<PB N="10" REF="034642_0008_0FFF437BEC017CD8">
"the law of kindne&s;s on his lips," we "ri&s;e up and call him ble&s;&s;ed." When he is taken away, the unfeigned grief of tho&s;e who &s;urvive him is a richer te&s;timony to his virtues and a greater men|ument of his worth than marble or bra&s;s can erect for him.</P>
<P>THE friend&s;hip of David and Jonathan did not ari&s;e from natural relation. It was founded on e&s;teem and affection, and e&s;tabli&s;hed by that mu|tual intercour&s;e of virtuous and affectionate offices which can alone &s;upport friend&s;hip. How &s;trong are the bands of &s;uch an attachment! How awful the &s;hock when death cru&s;hes and di&s;&s;olves it! Such friends, who were "lovely and plea&s;ant in their lives," do hardly wi&s;h "in their deaths to be divided."</P>
<P>IT is plea&s;ant to &s;ee a man di&s;charging, with care, fidelity, and diligence, the various duties which he owes to &s;ociety; increa&s;ing the &s;tock of human knowledge and happine&s;s; mitigating the calamities and relieving the wants of the &s;ick, the poor, and the needy; contributing his utmo&s;t aid in furthering every humane in&s;titution, and accel|erating every &s;cientific pur&s;uit; active in the &s;er|vice of mankind, and yet "guiding his affairs with di&s;cretion." When &s;uch a man is taken away, we may &s;ay, with more propriety than it can be &s;aid of any of the heroes and conquerors whom pa&s;t hi&s;tory or the pre&s;ent time make known to us, "A prince and a great man is fallen this day."</P>
<P>BUT there is nothing which &s;o conciliates the affections of good men as goodne&s;s. The image
<PB N="11" REF="034642_0009_0FFF437D70374AD0">
of Chri&s;t is dear to his di&s;ciples, let it be in&s;tamped on whom it may. How delightful is it to &s;ee the marks of true piety, of chri&s;tian integrity, of the mild &s;pirit and temper of Je&s;us Chri&s;t! When we ob&s;erve a man daily walking with God in the per|formance, the cheerful performance of the duties which he owes to his Maker, his fellow-men and his own &s;oul: When we &s;ee him afraid of doing the lea&s;t thing which may offend God, and de&s;ir|ous of di&s;covering what is right, in order that he may punctually do it: When we &s;ee him produc|ing rich clu&s;ters of the fruits of righteou&s;ne&s;s; what chri&s;tian can refrain from loving him?&mdash;Although he may differ from us in &s;ome &s;entiments, and may not entertain preci&s;ely the &s;ame ideas of the doctrines of the go&s;pel as we do, yet dare we with|hold from him not only our charity but our e&s;|teem and affection? If we can&mdash;we want the &s;pi|rit of Chri&s;t our&s;elves, and prove that our loude&s;t religious profe&s;&s;ions are a "founding bra&s;s and a tinkling cymbal."</P>
<P>God is plea&s;ed to give to different men different opportunities of improving the faculties with which he endues them. But he is peculiarly kind to any one, whom by his grace he furni&s;hes with a pious heart and di&s;cerning head, a learned edu|cation, and a facility in communicating his ideas; and then places him in the work of the mini&s;try. This is an employment mo&s;t grateful to a man of piety and learning; and it is excellently calculated to make a good heart better. This employment al&s;o endears him, who faithfully di&s;charges it, to all the wi&s;e and the good. The mini&s;ter who
<PB N="12" REF="034642_0010_0FFF438059233DE0">
takes pains to find out "the truth as it is in Je&s;us," and then clearly delivers what he believes to be &s;o, although it may expo&s;e him to cen&s;ure and inconvenience, proves his integrity and "de|&s;erves double honor." If he is diligent in his &s;tudies; if he is con&s;tant in his attention to all the private and public duties of his profe&s;&s;ion; if his compo&s;itions di&s;cover a fund of knowledge, and he is ma&s;ter of a cha&s;te, cla&s;&s;ical and elegant &s;tyle; if his public performances are grateful to his people; if in "all their afflictions he is afflict|ed," and under them, like the angel of peace, he pours balm into their wounded &s;pirits; then will he be dear and plea&s;ant, beyond de&s;cription, to them; and like the Galatians of old, "they will be ready to pluck out their own eyes and give them unto him."</P>
<P>A MINISTER of this character not only conciliates the e&s;teem and love of the people with whom he is immediately connected but of all tho&s;e who know his worth, in the place where he lives, or in more di&s;tant countries. His brethren, particu|larly, will feel them&s;elves drawn to him with the &s;tronge&s;t cords of affection, and will rejoice in his gifts, his graces, his u&s;efulne&s;s, and his acceptance. Are there any literary honors or di&s;tinctions to be given? He will receive them, and will have the &s;atisfaction of hearing every one agree that they are worthily be&s;towed. He will live beloved, and will die univer&s;ally lamented.</P>
<P>You, my brethren of this &s;ociety, know that the de&s;cription, which has now been given of the man and the mini&s;ter who is plea&s;ant, u&s;eful and accept|able,
<PB N="13" REF="034642_0011_0FFF4383EC3BCAA0">
applies exactly to your late excellent Pa&s;tor. The picture was drawn from the life, and it mu&s;t be a likene&s;s. I am &s;ure you will not charge me with flattering his memory when I make this a&s;|&s;ertion. We are not &s;urpri&s;ed at your grief on this heavy lo&s;s. You who knew his private and public worth, and who &s;at con&s;tantly under his mini&s;trations; you in who&s;e welfare, &s;piritual and temporal, he was &s;o deeply intere&s;ted, could not but highly prize this precious gift of our a&s;cended Saviour, and you cannot but weep now he is no more.</P>
<P>THE manner in which death arre&s;ted him, engag|ed in your &s;ervice and in your pre&s;ence, mu&s;t have deeply wounded your feelings. Yet you &s;hould con&s;ole your&s;elves with the thought, that this is the be&s;t mode of dying for one who lives habitu|ally prepared for the coming of his Ma&s;ter. He e&s;caped the &s;evere pangs of di&s;&s;olution, and the agony of parting with his friends. From the im|mediate &s;ervice of his Ma&s;ter upon earth, he was tran&s;lated, we tru&s;t and believe, to the &s;ublimer &s;ervices of Heaven.</P>
<P>IT will be your &s;olicitude to make a profitable improvement of this affecting event. You re|member the wi&s;e coun&s;els, the faithful reproofs, the excellent in&s;tructions, which your mini&s;ter gave you from time to time. You remember in what a &s;triking light he &s;et before you the evidences of our holy religion, the excellency of our divine Re|deemer, and the nece&s;&s;ity of virtue, piety, and be|nevolence to our happine&s;s here and hereafter. You cannot forget how he pre&s;&s;ed upon you the
<PB N="14" REF="034642_0012_0FFF43856FBD8EC0">
ob&s;ervation of the Sabbath, an attendance upon public wor&s;hip, and e&s;pecially an obedience to the dying command of Chri&s;t. "By the&s;e things, al|though he is dead before you, he yet &s;peaketh." Let me conjure you, by your regard to him as well as to your own &s;ouls, to "think on and practi&s;e the&s;e things." "Remember how you have re|ceived and heard," and God grant that "your <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> may appear unto all men"!</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> was Dr. CLARKE intere&s;ted in the pro&s;perity of this &s;ociety, as that nothing could give him more plea&s;ure than to observe its growth and unanimity. Let this be a motive with you to avoid all divi&s;ion to cultivate a &s;pirit of kind|ne&s;s and conde&s;cen&s;ion towards each other. You will not "for&s;ake the a&s;&s;embling of your&s;elves to|gether." You will "continue in breaking of bread and in prayer." You will "&s;tudy the things which make for peace, and whereby one may edify another," and in due time we tru&s;t that "God will give you another pa&s;tor after his own heart." Let not your feelings be wounded by this &s;ugge&s;tion. You and I are following our dear brother fa&s;t into the world of &s;pirits, and it is our duty to provide religious in&s;truction as well as other good things for our children. What we can do for them, and for the church of God, we ought to do at once, becau&s;e "the night cometh, when no man can work." Be&s;ides, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> genera|tion pa&s;&s;eth away and another cometh." The or|der of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion mu&s;t not be violated. Could our lamented friend now addre&s;s you, I doubt not he would urge you to peace and union, and advi&s;e
<PB N="15" REF="034642_0013_0FFF43881961AE40">
you not to remain "as &s;heep without a &s;hepherd." We commend you to God and the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and give you an inheritance among all them that are &s;ancti|fied"!</P>
<P>THE grief, the exqui&s;ite grief of the immediate connexions of Dr. CLARKE, renders it improper for me publicly to addre&s;s them. "God hath taken away the de&s;ire of their eyes with a &s;troke." But, let them bow &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively to the divine will, and place their tru&s;t in him who "liveth and abid|eth for ever," and who will never leave nor for|&s;ake them.</P>
<P>THE church which has for many years been clo&s;ely connected <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Fir&s;t Church and the Church in Brattle-&s;treet have been connected in a lecture previous to the communion, for 78 years. When their hou&s;es of wor&s;hip have been building or repairing, they have always met together on Lord's-days.</NOTE> with this, feels &s;en&s;ibly an event &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ing. They experienced his kindne&s;s and attention when they were them&s;elves vacant, and they "e&s;teemed him highly in love for his work's &s;ake." Were it proper to introduce any thing per&s;onal on this occa&s;ion, I &s;hould &s;ay, that God hath taken away one of the deare&s;t of my friends, and one of the highe&s;t enjoyments of my life. But the will of God is done. He is "holy in all his ways, and righteous in all his works."</P>
<P>WE, my brethren in the mini&s;try, have many good le&s;&s;ons to learn from this &s;olemn event. We &s;ee that neither great talents, real piety, nor the warme&s;t affection of tho&s;e whom we &s;erve, can &s;e|cure us from the lot of all men. We &s;ee how &s;oon
<PB N="16" REF="034642_0014_0FFF438BC1F09CD0">
and how &s;uddenly we may be called to our ac|count; and we are taught &s;o to perform the &s;ol|emn offices of religion as that we may not be afraid to be &s;ummoned from them to the bar of our Judge. Such an idea mu&s;t rai&s;e us above "the fear of man, which bringeth a &s;nare." It mu&s;t render us careful to "deliver the whole coun&s;el of God"; and &s;o to "keep our hearts" when we &s;erve him in his hou&s;e, as that we may have the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of the man whom "the Lord, when he cometh, &s;hall find &s;o doing."</P>
<P>THE members of the literary and benevolent a&s;|&s;ociations, with which Dr. CLARKE was connect|ed, will feel them&s;elves deeply affected by his lo&s;s. His exertions to promote the important views of their in&s;titution were never wanting. While he &s;hared the honors of office. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. CLARKE was a Coun&s;ellor of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and Corre&s;ponding Secretary of the Humans Society of the Commonwealth of Ma&s;&s;achusetts.</NOTE> in &s;ome of them, he was careful to perform the duties which were an|nexed to it. It becomes tho&s;e of us who &s;urvive to imitate his indu&s;try and exertion, &s;o that when we &s;hall follow our departed brother and a&s;&s;oci|ate to the world of &s;pirits, tho&s;e who &s;urvive may "ri&s;e up and call us ble&s;&s;ed."</P>
<P>LEARN, my brethren of this great a&s;&s;embly, learn all of you, the vanity and uncertainty of life. Here you &s;ee the end of all fle&s;h. At this goal, every man, who runs the race of life, mu&s;t, &s;ooner or later, arrive. Learn, that "in the mid&s;t of life you are in death," and that you "know neither the day nor the hour when the Son of Man &s;hall
<PB N="17" REF="034642_0015_0FFF438D46D88488">
come." Li&s;ten to the voice which addre&s;&s;es you from the &s;able urn of this mini&s;ter of God, and &s;peaks loudly, "Be ye al&s;o ready." While life and health and rea&s;on are granted you, improve them to &s;ecure an intere&s;t in "the better part which can never be taken from you." We are fol|lowing each other rapidly into the world of &s;pirits. We &s;hall &s;oon pa&s;s through the valley of the &s;had|ow of death. "The eye of him that hath &s;een us, &s;hall &s;ee us no more. We &s;hall return no more to our hou&s;es, neither &s;hall our places know us any more." Let us now then "give diligence to make our calling and election &s;ure." The ble&s;&s;ings of the go&s;pel are offered to us, and urged on our ac|ceptance. Let us not delay our attention to them, but "&s;eek the Lord while he may be found, and call upon him now he is near."</P>
<P>And now&mdash;Farewell! Farewell forever! SWEET SHADE OF OUR DEPARTED FRIEND!&mdash;Thy pre|cious du&s;t we will reverendly commit to the "hou&s;e appointed for all living"!&mdash;Thy memory we will cultivate with warm and tender affection!&mdash;Thy de&s;olate family, thy widowed wife, and thy fath|erle&s;s children, we will coun&s;el, a&s;&s;i&s;t, and protect!&mdash;Soon &s;hall we follow thee where "the wicked cea&s;e from troubling, and the weary are at re&s;t." There will we &s;leep in peace till "the trumpet &s;hall &s;ound, and the dead &s;hall be rai&s;ed." Then will we &s;pring together to a new and eternal life!&mdash;"Then this mortal &s;hall put on immortality, and this corruptible &s;hall put on incorruption, and death &s;hall be &s;wallowed up of victory!"</P>

<P>SO ju&s;t a character of your late excellent Pa&s;tor was drawn by the Gentleman who delivered a di&s;cour&s;e from this de&s;k, on the day of his funeral, that little more can be expected. But as I had a particular opportunity of knowing him, from the commencement of his literary cour&s;e at Cam|bridge, with little interruption, till the time of his death, it will not, perhaps, be thought improper, &s;hould I, on this &s;olemn day, offer a few things upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>BEING a Tutor at the Univer&s;ity when he be|came a member, and the cla&s;s to which he belong|ed being committed to my particular care, I had an early opportunity of knowing his character, and I was &s;oon led to di&s;tingui&s;h in him that genius and application to &s;tudy, together with that amiable di&s;po&s;ition and excellent &s;pirit, which have ever &s;ince con&s;picuou&s;ly &s;hone in him. For two years and a quarter I continued with the cla&s;s, and during that his improvements in literature and &s;cience were very ob&s;ervable; and his conduct
<PB N="19" REF="034642_0017_0FFF439189ACBEE0">
was &s;o uniformly good, in every re&s;pect, that he never merited or received a cen&s;ure or a frown from any one who had the care and in&s;truction of the youth; and I found by information, after my leaving the cla&s;s and the Univer&s;ity, that he main|tained the &s;ame character, through the whole of his. Collegiate cour&s;e. And, perhaps, there never was a &s;tudent, who pa&s;&s;ed through the Univer&s;ity and went into the world with a fairer reputation, and few with more &s;olid and u&s;eful acquirements.</P>
<P>HAPPY is it, when youth improve their advan|tages in &s;eats of literature and &s;cience to &s;o good advantage&mdash;Happy when they carry forth with them a character &s;o unblemi&s;hed, into whatever profe&s;&s;ion or bu&s;iness they enter&mdash;Peculiarly hap|py; if they undertake the work of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>FOR &s;ome time after Mr. CLARKE left the Uni|ver&s;ity, he was engaged in the in&s;truction of youth, in which employment he was highly e&s;teemed and beloved. But whatever his pur&s;uits were, he did not &s;uffer his mind to be diverted from the great object he had in view, which was to fit for the &s;a|cred de&s;k. While he was faithful in performing the bu&s;ine&s;s he undertook, he devoted his lei&s;ure hours to accompli&s;h him&s;elf for that profe&s;&s;ion which lay neare&s;t his heart; and he pur&s;ued his theological &s;tudies with great a&s;&s;iduity, &s;o that when he <HI>fir&s;t entered</HI> the de&s;k it was not with a &s;uperficial knowledge. His natural abilities and literary ac|quirements were &s;uch as enabled him to &s;earch the
<PB N="20" REF="034642_0018_0FFF439515098B38">
Sacred Oracles with accuracy, e&s;pecially the Orig|inal of the New-Te&s;tament, and to attend to every &s;ubject in Divinity with judgment. And &s;uch was the candor and fairne&s;s of his mind, that few men, perhaps, have been more free from prejudices in their re&s;earches: He therefore became a Scribe well in&s;tructed in the Go&s;pel Sy&s;tem.</P>
<P>His di&s;cour&s;es early di&s;covered an elegant ta&s;te in compo&s;ition, a correctne&s;s, propriety and perti|nence in thought, and that &s;train of &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and piety, which could not but be attractive. You, my Brethren, &s;oon heard of his worth; and when you employed him as a Candidate for the Mini&s;try among you, your expectations from him were not di&s;appointed; nay, it will not be beyond the truth to &s;ay, that they were more than an&s;wered. After preaching with you a competent time, he was or|dained over you as a Colleague Pa&s;tor with the venerable, learned and valuable Doctor CHAUNCY, with whom he &s;erved as a Son with a Father; and between them there ever exi&s;ted the mo&s;t happy harmony, till the day of the Doctor's death.</P>
<P>HAVING obtained a &s;ettlement, he did not grow remi&s;s about future improvements, but continued the &s;ame a&s;&s;iduity which had been a di&s;tingui&s;hed trait in his character. To the liberal Arts and Sciences, for which he had a true reli&s;h, and in which he was no <HI>common</HI> proficient, he, at times, paid attention. But the&s;e he con&s;idered as noth|ing more than handmaids to Divinity, and of but &s;econdary con&s;ideration. Divinity was his profe&s;|&s;ion,
<PB N="21" REF="034642_0019_0FFF4397A48CFEA0">
and to this he directly applied a principal part of his time. He had devoted him&s;elf to the cau&s;e of God and the Redeemer, and he would not &s;uf|fer other pur&s;uits, however plea&s;ing to his ingeni|ous mind, to &s;teal him away from his proper func|tions, and rob him of that time which he con&s;ider|ed him&s;elf bound in duty to employ for the in&s;truc|tion and edification of his flock, either in prepara|tion for his public labors among them, or in pri|vate interviews with the various members.&mdash;I have dwelt the more largely on this part of his character, becau&s;e of &s;cholar of Doctor CLARKE'S acquirements, and ta&s;te for literature and &s;cience, is under a &s;trong temptation to &s;pend more time in &s;uch pur&s;uits than is con&s;i&s;tent with properly di&s;charging the duties of his &s;acred profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>YOUR Pa&s;tor employed him&s;elf much in the &s;tudy of the Holy Scriptures. To the&s;e heavenly Oracles he repaired, as the &s;ources of divine know|ledge, and endeavoured to gain right apprehen&s;ions of the truths contained in them, both for his own &s;ake and the &s;ake of his hearers, whom he in&s;truct|ed in the&s;e, according to his be&s;t under&s;tanding, after making u&s;e of the mo&s;t approved helps he could procure, and which he was con&s;tantly laying him&s;elf out to obtain.</P>
<P>HIS pulpit-performances were always acceptable With tho&s;e compo&s;itions of his, which I have either heard or read, I have ever been plea&s;ed and edified. His Treati&s;e in defence of Chri&s;tianity, entitled, "Why are you a Chri&s;tian?" is, perhaps, as val|uable
<PB N="22" REF="034642_0020_0FFF439A2EA07660">
a piece as has been written within the &s;ame compa&s;s. By its conci&s;ene&s;s it is well adapted to being di&s;per&s;ed; and by its per&s;picuity and perti|nence happily calculated to convince and confirm. It is highly e&s;teemed, not only on this, but on the other &s;ide of the Atlantic. I have received, but a little while &s;ince, a letter from a re&s;pectable Divine in Great-Britain. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Rev. Jo&s;hua Toulmin, D. D. of Taunton.</NOTE> In this letter he &s;ays, "We have here been greatly plea&s;ed, in&s;tructed and im|pre&s;&s;ed by a little piece written by one of your Mini&s;ters, Mr. CLARKE, entitled,&mdash;"Why are you a Chri&s;tian?" And after mentioning that three editions of it had been printed in England, two of which he him&s;elf had carried through the pre&s;s, he adds,&mdash;"The circulation of it cannot fail to give plea&s;ure to the pious and worthy Author, and to en&s;ure its views of u&s;efulne&s;s."</P>
<P>HIS plea&s;ing private intercour&s;e with you, and al&s;o with the children of the Society, whom he de|lighted to in&s;truct, you need not be reminded of. The impre&s;&s;ions made by the&s;e endearments will not be &s;oon, if ever, effaced. Indeed, &s;o &s;weet was his di&s;po&s;ition, and &s;o engaging his manners; &s;o plea&s;ing was he in his conver&s;ation, and &s;o amiable in all his interviews with tho&s;e he met, that a gen|eral e&s;teem of and affection for him was almo&s;t un|avoidably excited; and he was beloved by all but the determined foes of virtue and goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>I PASS over his dome&s;tic virtues, in which he was eminent, and which all, who knew him, witne&s;&s;ed.</P>

<HEAD>The following CHARACTER, by another Hand, was publi&s;hed in the Columbian Centinel the day after the Interment.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> <DATE><HI>April</HI> 7, 1798.</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>JOHN CLARKE, D. D. Pa&s;tor of the fir&s;t church in Bo&s;ton, was born at Port&s;mouth, in New-Hamp&s;hire, April 13, 1755; graduated at Harvard College in 1774; and ordained July 8, 1778, as colleague with the late Dr. Chauncy, with whom he lived in the mo&s;t intimate and re&s;pectful friend&s;hip about 9 years; and afterwards contin|ued, a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly and faithfully labouring in the &s;er|vice of the church, until the Lord's day, April 1, 1798; when, in the mid&s;t of his afternoon &s;ermon, he was &s;uddenly &s;eized with an apoplexy, fell down in the pulpit, and expired in le&s;s than twelve hours; having almo&s;t completed the 43d year of his age, and the 20th year of his mini&s;try.</P>
<P>DESCENDED from re&s;pectable parents, who live to lament an only &s;on, he di&s;covered in early life the &s;igns of genius and indu&s;try. At the Univer|&s;ity he was di&s;tingui&s;hed by a clo&s;e attention to cla&s;&s;ic and philo&s;ophic &s;tudies, by a &s;trict obedience to the laws, and by irreproachable morals. In the office of Preceptor, he was gentle and per&s;ua&s;ive, beloved by his pupils, and e&s;teemed by their friends. As a public preacher, his compo&s;itions bore the marks of penetration, judgment, per&s;picuity and elegance. Faithful to the intere&s;t of religion, he
<PB N="25" REF="034642_0023_0FFF43A400D0C168">
deeply examined its foundation and evidence; and per&s;uaded of the truth and importance of the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem, he recommended, by his public di&s;cour&s;es and private conver&s;ation, its &s;ublime doctrines, its wi&s;e in&s;titutions, and its &s;alutary precepts.</P>
<P>THOUGH fond of polite literature and philo&s;ophic re&s;earches, yet he con&s;idered theology as the proper &s;cience of a Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter. To this object he principally devoted his time and &s;tudies, and was earne&s;tly de&s;irous of inve&s;tigating every branch of it, not merely to gratify his own &s;acred curio&s;ity, but that he might impart to his hearers the whole coun&s;el of God. He was habitually a clo&s;e &s;tudent; and it is not improbable, that the inten&s;ene&s;s of his mental application proved too &s;evere for the deli|cate fabric of his nerves.</P>
<P>HIS devotional addre&s;&s;es were copious and fer|vent; and his interce&s;&s;ions &s;trong and affectionate, di&s;covering at once the ardor of his piety and the warmth of his benevolence. In the private offices of pa&s;toral friend&s;hip, he was truly exemplary and engaging. His temper was mild and cheerful, his manners ea&s;y and polite; and the &s;ocial virtues of an hone&s;t heart gave a glow to his language, and enlivened every circle in which he was conver&s;ant.</P>
<P>IN the relations of a &s;on, a brother, a hu&s;band, a father, a guardian, a corre&s;pondent, a ma&s;ter, a friend, and a member of &s;everal literary and char|itable &s;ocieties, his deportment was marked with affection, fidelity and carefulne&s;s. He was con|cerned
<PB N="26" REF="034642_0024_0FFF43A583C67DE0">
for the intere&s;t, reputation and happine&s;s of all his connections; and zealou&s;ly devoted to the cau&s;e of &s;cience and humanity.</P>
<P>BEING &s;ucce&s;&s;or to <HI>ten</HI> eminent luminaries of the church of God, he was &s;tudious to emulate them in piety, learning and u&s;efulne&s;s. Like three of them, he was &s;uddenly called off from his mini&s;te|rial labours, and having happily e&s;caped the pain|ful agonies of a lingering death, is gone to receive the reward of a faithful &s;ervant, and enter into the joy of his Lord.</P>
