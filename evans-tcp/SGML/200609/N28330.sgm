<P>Hear me Elvira&mdash;Shame from his late defeat, and burning wishes for revenge, again have brought Pizarro to Peru: But trust me, he overrates his strength, nor measures well the foe.

The army murmuring at increasing hardships, while Pizarro decorates with gaudy spoil the gay pavilion of his luxury! each day diminishes our force.</P>

<SPEAKER>Elv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hear me, Valverde.&mdash;When first my virgin fancy waked to love, Pizarro was my country's idol. Self|taught, self-raised, and self-supported, he became a hero; and I was formed to be won by glory and renown. 'Tis known that when he left Panama in a slight vessel, his force was not an hundred men. Arrived in the island of Gallo with his sword he drew a line upon the sands, and said, "Pass those who fear to die or conquer with their leader." Thirteen alone remained, and at the head of these the warrior stood his ground. Even at the mo|ment when my ears first caught this tale, my heart ex|claimed, "Pizarro is its lord!" What since I have

At my table did he feast&mdash;in my sent did he repose. I had marked his early genius and the valorous spirit that grew with it.
