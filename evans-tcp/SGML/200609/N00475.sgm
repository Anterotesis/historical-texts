<HEAD>An APPEAL from the Twenty Eight JUDGES TO THE Spirit of Truth &amp; true Judgment In all Faithful Friends, called Quakers, that meet at this Yearly Meeting at Burlington, the 7 Month, 1692.</HEAD>
<P>WHereas twenty eight Per&s;ons, called Friends of the Mi|ni&s;try, have publi&s;h't a Paper of fal&s;e Judgment again&s;t <HI>George Keith,</HI> and the re&s;t of his Friends and Brethren, without any Hearing or Tryal, We, in behalf of the re&s;t, do make this our Serious and Solemn Appeal to the Spirit of Truth &amp; true Judgment in you all, that by the help &amp; guidance of the &s;ame, ye may enquire and &s;earch into the matter, reque&s;ting &amp; be&s;eeching you to do Ju&s;tice in the&s;e things, for the Vindication of the Truth, the honour of Chri&s;t, the Peace of your Con&s;ciences, &amp; the Credit and Repute of our holy Profe&s;&s;ion, &amp; making up the Breach that is among us, if po&s;&s;ible, &amp; an&s;wering the expectation of our faith|ful Brethren in <HI>England,</HI> and other places of the World, who will be greatly concern'd with us, that Ju&s;tice and true Judgment may take place impartially, and without re&s;pect of Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>And <HI>Friends,</HI> Think it not &s;trang, that we Appeal to you univer&s;ally, that by the Spirit of Truth ye may give true Judg|ment in the&s;e matters concerning Us and the&s;e Twenty Eight Per&s;ons, and others of the Mini&s;try who are joyned with them therein; for tho' upon a pretence of their being Mini&s;ters, they claim a Superiority over you the Lords Heritage &amp; People, as if ye were not capable nor qualified to judge them, but that they have Authority to judge you, &amp; on this pretended Authority (too like the <HI>Roman-Herarchy</HI>) <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> have &s;ent their Paper of Judg|ment
