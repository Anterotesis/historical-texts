<HEAD>A DECLARATION Of the Inhabitants and Souldiers, belonging under the several Companies of the Traind-Bands of New-York.</HEAD>
<P>WE Declare, that notwithstanding our several Pressures and Grievances these many years under a wicked Arbitrary Power exercised by our Late Popish Governour <HI>Dongan,</HI> and several of his wicked Crea|tures and Pentionaries, especially now under Lieutenant Governour <HI>Nicholson:</HI> We were resolved to expect with great patience, our Re|demption from <HI>England,</HI> expecting to have part of that blessed and glorious Deliverance procuted under God, by his Royal Highness, <HI>William Henry,</HI> Prince of <HI>Orange;</HI> but when we challenged our Liberty, Property, and the Laws, we were cajolled and terrify|ed out of our reason, but at last some being threatned by the said Lieutenant Governour <HI>Nicholson,</HI> and with a Pistol presented against the Corporal, and said to the Lieutenant <HI>Cuyler,</HI> that he would set the City on fire, for doing our Loyal Duty. We have thought fit for our Conservation, and fear, to be lyable to answer for the Life of every Protestant that might have perished, and every House burnt or destroyed, if we had remained lon|ger in Security; and also seeing daily Arrive from several parts Officers and Souldiers, who were entertained by the said Lieutenant Governour <HI>Nicholson</HI> in the Fort, besides his several Souldiers, of which there was a number of Papists, contrary to the Law of <HI>En|gland;</HI> by which New-comers, some of the Burgers being threatned of some Design a|gainst them in few days, we thought Delay dangerous, so we have unanimously Resol|ved to live no longer in such a danger, but to secure the Fort better, which we have un|der God; with success without Resistance and blood-shed effected: And we Declare to be entirely and openly opposite to Papists and their Religion, and therefore expecting Orders from <HI>England,</HI> we shall Keep and Guard surely and faithfully the said Fort in the behalf of the Power that now Governeth in <HI>England,</HI> to surrender to the Person of the Protestant Religion, that shall be Nominated, or Sent by the Power above-said.</P>
<P>These are our most sincere Intententions, that we are glad to manifest, as well to the Power abovesaid, that God hath pleased to submit us to, as to other persons, to avoid their Reproaches, that they could otherwise unjustly lay upon the abovesaid Inhabitants.</P>

<P>H<HI>Endrick Cuyler,</HI> Lieutenant to the Company of Captain <HI>Abrah. de Peister,</HI> Aged about Fifty Two Years: Deposeth, That on the Thirtieth Day of <HI>May</HI> last past, he Commanding half a Company of the Trained-bands, in the Fort of <HI>New-York,</HI> gave Order to one of his Corporals, to place a Sentinel at a certain Sally-port in the said Fort; but that the said Corporal returning, Declared to him the Deponent,
<PB REF="039248_0002_1013F9CEA6749AC0">
that the Corporal of the Kings Souldiers in Pay in the said Fort would not suffer him to place a Sentinel there: And that afterwards, the Lieutenant Governour, Captain <HI>Ni|cholson</HI> the then Commander in Chief, returning to the Fort, sent for him the said Depo|nent to come to him in his Chamber in the said Fort, which he the said Deponent did, and desired his Corporal <HI>Hendrick Jacobs</HI> to go along with him, because he the said Corporal could speak better <HI>English,</HI> and that as soon as the said Deponent was come up into the said Chamber, he called for his said Corporal, who followed him to come into the Chamber; which he did, and that as soon as the said Lieutenant Governour saw the said Corporal, he rose up in a passion, and said to the said Corporal, You Racal, what do you here, with that the said Corporal returned answer, that he came to be Interpreter to him the said Deponent; whereupon he the said Lieutenant Governour, took down a Pistol that hung by the wall, and threatned to shoot him the said Corporal, and drove him out of the Room, and that afterwards the said Deponent remaining still in the said Room alone with the said Lieutenant Governour, the said Lieutenant Governour told him the said Deponent, that there were so many Rogues in the Town, that he was not sure of his life, nor to walk the streets, and that he the said Lieutenant Governour farther said, that before it should longer go after this manner, he would set the Town on Fire, and further saith not.</P>
