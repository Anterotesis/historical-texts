<P>When <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> returned from the Mount, unto this Idolatrous People, this was One of the awful Demands, which he brought from Heaven unto them; <HI>Therefore now Put off thy Ornament from thee.</HI> The Chaldee reads it; <HI>Put off thy Armour.</HI> And, if it be &s;o read, it &s;eems the Language of a Provoked General, Ordering the <HI>Rebellious Legions</HI>&punc; to be <HI>Di&s;|armed,</HI> that &s;o he may proceed unto what Puni&s;hment he plea&s;e upon them.

It admini&s;ters occa&s;ion, by the way, to let fall an Admonition concerning a Fault which is too common among us; On our Dayes of HUMILIATION many of our People ap|pear with too gay <HI>Ornaments</HI> upon them.

<P>In the world before the Flood, we read of <HI>Two</HI> Generations.

The Ancient Writers of <HI>Primitive Chri&s;tianity</HI> make an Illu&s;trious <HI>Type</HI> of this matter. The <HI>Cainites</HI> are a <HI>Type</HI> of the Men of this World, or&punc; of the Kingdom of Satan in this World.

of God. Even among the <HI>Cainites,</HI> there may be Great <HI>Hero</HI>'s, there may be Great <HI>Scholars,</HI> there may be Wealthy <HI>Landlords</HI>; and there may be tho&s;e who may have all the Charms of <HI>Nature</HI> upon them.</P>
<P>There is the Unaccountable <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of GOD, in Ordering of it.

<P>The <HI>Compa&s;&s;ion</HI> of Heaven al&s;o does Con|&s;ult the Welfare of <HI>Humane Society</HI> in thus Ordering of it.

<P N="2">II.

<P>We read of an <HI>Adorned Sepulchre.</HI> What is an <HI>Adorned Sinner</HI> but an <HI>Adorned Sepulchre</HI>?

<PB N="9" REF="001314_0007_0FB276F152BB70D0">
and Straight-way forget</HI> what manner of thing thou art.

<P><HI>Original Sin,</HI> Our <HI>Original Sin</HI> has brought us under an <HI>&V;niver&s;al Depravation</HI>&punc; it has depraved us with an <HI>&V;niver&s;al Defor|mity.</HI> By lo&s;ing the <HI>Image</HI> of GOD, we have Lo&s;t our <HI>Ornaments.</HI> By having the <HI>Sa|tanick Image</HI> upon us, which are made mo&s;t <HI>horrible Objects.</HI> &mdash; But I anticipate my &s;elf; My Di&s;cour&s;e is yet but coming to that Ex|tremity.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t fir&s;t &s;ay; To be born a <HI>Sinner,</HI> is to be born a <HI>Monster.</HI> Tis as Odious, as Frightful, as to be born with the Scales of the <HI>Leviathan</HI>; to be born with the <HI>Belly</HI> where the <HI>Head</HI> &s;hould be; with <HI>Eyes</HI> in the Back-part of the Head; with the <HI>Hands</HI> growing to the Mouth; with the <HI>Feet</HI> made for ever to go awry every Step. I Speak Significantly; Sinner, &s;uch, even &s;uch a <HI>Mon&s;ter</HI> would be thy very <HI>Em|blem.</HI> There is no Sinner, but from his very <HI>Birth,</HI> every thing is <HI>Out of Order</HI> with him.</P>
<P>Is not an <HI>Hater of God,</HI> an <HI>horrible Object</HI>? No Good Man can without Horror think of &s;uch an Object. But &s;uch an one is every Unrenewed Sinner, every Unrepenting Sin|ner. We read, Rom. 1.30. They are

<P>We generally decry a man, who <HI>Loves none but him&s;elf.</HI> A Sinner not changed by Grace, comes under this Character. He &s;ets up <HI>him&s;elf</HI> at his GOD.

<P>We generally decry a man who is <HI>Ingrate|ful</HI> to his Benefactor. This is the Black Character of a Sinner, whom Grace has not made a change upon. His <HI>Ingratitude</HI> unto GOD, who <HI>Keeps</HI> him, who <HI>Feeds</HI> him, who, <HI>daily Loads him with his Benefits,</HI> tis the mo&s;t abominable Thing that ever was heard of. He is alwayes <HI>Reproaching the Lord,</HI> whom every Moment he lives upon.</P>
<P>How <HI>Deformed</HI> were a <HI>Man</HI> turn'd into a <HI>Dog,</HI> a <HI>Swine,</HI> a <HI>Serpent!</HI> So is the Unrenewed Sinner Painted in the Book of God! A Creature full of <HI>Ornaments</HI> indeed! <HI>Born a Wild A&s;&s;es Colt!</HI> A curious Creature truly&punc;</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t at la&s;t bring the matter to the Extremity.

<P>La&s;tly; I leave to the <HI>La&s;t</HI> of all, that which is truly to all Judicious People the <HI>Lea&s;t</HI> of all; There are Some <HI>Adorned</HI> with <HI>Splen|did Apparrel.</HI> Their <HI>Garments</HI> are their <HI>Ornaments.</HI> The <HI>Meane&s;t</HI> of all <HI>Orna|ments</HI> are perhaps their <HI>Only <HI>Ornaments.</HI></HI> Perhaps they count &s;ome things to be <HI>Or|naments,</HI> which the Sober and the Vertuous in all Ages have decried, as not being the <HI>Spots of the Children of God.</HI> Particularly, The <HI>Spots</HI> which disfigure the Faces of &s;o many Gentlewomen in our Days, have in all former Ages been decried by all Pious Per|&s;ons, as <HI>Blemi&s;hes,</HI> and <HI>Vanities,</HI> altogether misbecoming the <HI>Children of God</HI>: altogether improper for <HI>Bapti&s;ed Faces</HI>! Children, Wa&s;h them off, with the <HI>Tears</HI> of true Devotion. Tho&s;e <HI>Tears</HI> would certainly do it.
