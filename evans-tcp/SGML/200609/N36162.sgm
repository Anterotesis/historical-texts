<OPENER><DATELINE>Philadelphia,
<DATE>March 17, 1794.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE rea&s;on of my pre&s;uming to addre&s;s you on the &s;ubject of the culture of Wool, is, becau&s;e it is a matter on which the gradual abolition of our National Debt depend, i. e. upon indu&s;try and population of America, as the &s;ame is held forth in the following ob&s;ervations. That this is the real fact, I &s;hall now undertake to prove: &s;o always, and provided, That you will patronize the following &s;cheme&mdash; What &s;ay you, Gentlemen, to this matter?&mdash;Now this great principle of patrioti&s;m, I prove thus:</P>
<P>Permit me, gentlemen, in pa&s;&s;ing, ju&s;t to ob&s;erve, that here, and no where el&s;e, lies all the <HI>life</HI> of our true policy &mdash;To cloath and feed our&s;elves, and our neighbouring na|tions. I take this as a <HI>po&s;tulatum</HI> that will without difficulty be granted.</P>
<P>Therefore,</P>
<P>Secondly, I &s;hall, gentlemen, open my&s;elf fully on that important &s;ubject; not for the &s;ake of telling you a long &s;to|ry (which I know the genuine patriots, are not particularly fond of) but for the &s;ake of the weighty in&s;truction that I flatter my&s;elf, will nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ult from our Shepherd's &s;cheme. It &s;hall not be longer if I can help it, than &s;o &s;e|rious a matter requires. The American Shepherd addre&s;&s;es us in this manner: He &s;ays, the rea&s;ons for my preferring this Shepherd's &s;cheme, are: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It is becau&s;e I want to &s;ee a plan for improving the pre&s;ent condition of the poor white people. <HI>Next,</HI> It is becau&s;e I wi&s;h to be beneficial to my country. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> It is becau&s;e I wi&s;h to throw my mite into the be&s;t public trea&s;ury, and therein improve it.</P>
<P>Come&mdash;help me rai&s;e the ever memorable Shepherd's Hall, and the profit thereof will be commen&s;urable to your
<PB N="5" REF="047213_0004_1022B82B4D742338">
public &s;pirit: yes, and will be your exceeding great reward. I labour not for my&s;elf only, but for all them that patronize the &s;aid &s;cheme.</P>
<P>He &s;ays, too, the po&s;ition by me maintained is, that this &s;cheme is more excellent, than the Yankie's Tontine bank; which is as follows:</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It is a &s;cheme to increa&s;e the declining number of &s;heep in America, and make wool our &s;taple commodity.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The &s;hort of the matter is this: Let it be &s;up|po&s;ed, that a number of well di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons appropriate a <HI>&s;mall &s;um</HI> of money each to the culture of wool.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Again, let it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that 6000 &s;heep may be pa&s;tured three miles round the Shepherd's Hall. Now here ari&s;es a nece&s;&s;ary query to tho&s;e well di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons, viz. What will three years produce of the &s;aid pa&s;ture be?</P>
<P>That the culture of wool will produce an incredible trea|&s;ury may be &s;een from the Engli&s;h manufactures. This &s;cheme properly executed will make the American exports exceed her imports, which is the highe&s;t degree of our American patri|oti&s;m. Q. E. D.</P>
<P>Again, let it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that government will be propi|tious to the &s;aid Shepherd's company, and give them a tract of land, &amp;c. And that government will lend them a &s;um of money at 4 per cent. The rea&s;on whereof is, becau&s;e the increa&s;e of the people will by indu&s;try reimbur&s;e the co&s;ts, and populate or furni&s;h a barren part of our land with the be&s;t &s;ort of people. Three things are here very remarkable: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That the &s;tate will thereby obtain 4 per cent. <HI>Second|ly,</HI> That government will thereby obtain a number of u&s;eful people. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> That government will thereby thus obtain the mechanic arts, and that this plan <HI>properly executed</HI> will employ a number of emigrants, viz. Shepherds, Ploughmen, and many other artificers, &amp;c. in all an indu&s;trious and inde|pendent city.</P>

</LETTER></NOTE> ju&s;tly fearful le&s;t they them&s;elves &s;hould have lo&s;t their wool marts, made a law,
<PB N="6" REF="047213_0005_1022B82CE791B708">
<HI>viz.</HI>&mdash;That no Engli&s;h <HI>ram</HI> &s;hould be conveigled to North America; a plain proof this, that we may make wool a &s;ta|ple commodity, and out-vie England: ju&s;t in proportion to the differential quantity of the land in England, and the quantity of land in the United States of America. All that I would be under&s;tood to imply, is, that when the number of our &s;heep increa&s;e proportionable to the number of our acres of land; then we &s;hall actually and <HI>de facto</HI> out-vie Eng|land, and thereby make our&s;elves independent, or not de|pend upon England, &amp;c. or not depend upon manufactories. It is plain, therefore, that our imports of woollen drapery will there by decrea&s;e, and our exportation of woollen drape|ry will thereby increa&s;e.</P>
<P>What has been &s;aid, re&s;pective to the nature of the pre|ceding &s;cheme implies its importance. But the way to facili|tate it will more fully appear in con&s;idering the formation of the articles of the company of the American Shepherds.</P>
<P>&rindx; N. B. Ob&s;erve&mdash;that the &s;ub&s;cription money <HI>is not</HI> to be paid until the &s;aid company &s;hall be e&s;tabli&s;hed with ar|ticles, and a power &s;ufficient to take this matter in hand. When once a company can be e&s;tabli&s;hed, with a fund &s;uffici|ent to begin, there is no doubt but that it will have 6000 &s;heep in every county in each &s;tate: yes, 6000 &s;heep in every American town&s;hip.</P>
<P>To con&s;titute the capital of the &s;aid company, &s;ub&s;criptions for &s;hares therein, at one Spani&s;h dollar each, payable after the articles of the &s;aid company are made, and when a &s;uf|ficient number of per&s;ons have &s;ub&s;cribed, they will have the right to form the articles of the con&s;titution of their com|pany of the American Shepherds.</P>
<P>Any per&s;on, partner&s;hip, &s;ociety, church, or body politic, may &s;ub&s;cribe for as many &s;hares as he, &s;he, or they may think proper.</P>
<P>Books, for the purpo&s;e of &s;ub&s;cribers entering their names, &amp;c. will be handed about by divers well di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT;</HEAD>
<P>BEING a &s;hort caution and warning to the carele&s;s inha|bitants of the United States of North-America, and mi&s;cel|laneous notes on the folly, &s;hame, and danger, of our be|ing dependant on the <HI>Briti&s;h,</HI> and other foreign markets.</P>
<P>Note 1. Americans! This&mdash;all this&mdash;is pre-meditat|ed again&s;t you, <HI>viz.</HI> War and ruin, by the perfidious court of London. It is plain, therefore, that we ought to prohibit her merchandize.</P>
<P>Note 2. Our pre&s;ent mercantile &s;y&s;tem is&mdash;that we de|pend on the culture of European wool; if &s;o, then we are <HI>not yet</HI> independent! Is this common &s;en&s;e? Is this a proof of our being independent? Is this the way to pay our Nati|onal debt? Is this a prudent &s;cheme? Whoever thinks &s;o, mu&s;t be little acquainted with independency, and dome&s;tic manufactures.</P>
<P>Let it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the murrain among the European &s;heep, and the pe&s;tilence, or an epidemical fever among the European people occa&s;ion the culture and manufactures of European wool to fail; if &s;o, then the indolent Americans &s;hall look to the culture of American wool, and &s;ee that they are all naked, the rich and the poor, and are not a&s;hamed.
<Q>This being <HI>&s;ub judice</HI> it is only prophetic; and what is prophecy but a narrative preceding the fact.</Q></P>
<P>Note 3. Being an extract of a letter from Calcutta, dated the 10th of November 1791.&mdash;
<Q>We &s;hould think that no cotton can be carried home from Bombay this year, and even the year following. They have had about Surat and tho&s;e places a mo&s;t dreadful famine, which occa&s;ioned an unheard of mortality among the natives. When this ca|lamity will end, is not known yet: and tho&s;e of the inha|bitants who &s;erve it, will fir&s;t think of cultivating rice be|fore they meddle with cotten.</Q></P>
<P><Q>You cannot expect a &s;ingle pound of cotten from this country; whatever quantity we have here, will all go to China.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Claypoole's Daily Adverti&s;er, dated Augu&s;t 9, 1792.</NOTE>&mdash;I mu&s;t add, that this extract is an apology for the preceding letter, and for the mi&s;cellaneous notes add|ed to it.</P>
<P>Note 4. Argument 1. It is argued, That if our Ameri|can hat-makers buy imported, foreign Wool, and that the
<PB N="8" REF="047213_0007_1022B83458B2AD78">
directors of our National Manufactory give a generous price for American Wool; then it is high time to make Wool our &s;taple commodity:</P>
<P>But the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> is true; therefore al&s;o the <HI>la&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>Note 5. Argument 2. If too great attention to com|merce will &s;oon introduce idlene&s;s and luxury; and though it may enrich a few particular per&s;ons, it will impoveri&s;h the country&mdash;then our government will one day be a mere bank|rupt.</P>
<P>But the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> is true&mdash;Ergo al&s;o the &s;econd will be true.</P>
<P>Note 6. Argument 3. By improving the productions of Nature, by manufactures, the national riches are aug|mented, and it is by carrying the&s;e fruits of indu&s;try to other nations, that a &s;olid commerce is e&s;tabli&s;hed in a great empire. &mdash;The American merchant will make his own reflections.</P>
<P>Note 7. This&mdash;being the one only way to be independent of England, ought to determine your doubts on this head. Let this then, my countrymen, call forth your con&s;idera|tion. The &s;ubject is public good, and certainly merits, by its importance, the attention of every per&s;on in woollen drapery.</P>
<P>Any per&s;on who may reject this &s;cheme, is reque&s;ted to produce a better.&mdash;That I do in <HI>Truth</HI>&mdash;what all pre|tend, and mo&s;t men believe they do; I love my country.&mdash; This di&s;po&s;ition has moved me to do, what every man ought to do, to given attention to its intere&s;t, and to endeavour to promote its good.</P>
