behold! as for the boy he run a way, but one Jo&s;eph ketched him and brought him back, and then &s;tripped tho&s;e dying men: pre&s;&s;ent|ly I heard the other Indiens fire, and brought the other &s;culps to us, and their cloaths, lea|ving them on the ground, whome I had to beg for quarters as I had of the others; now thos thre and the other two made 5 &s;culps a bloody conque&s;t endeed. Loaded their mu&s;quets and &s;o &s;at of I knuw not whither, as it appered for their wigwoms; their 2 cunnoas being halled up into the woods&mdash;3 in one, and my &s;elf and the boy in the other, tho&s;e &s;culps in the bottom of the connoa to &s;itt on, a bloody carpett indeed, both ter|rable and fritefull&mdash;a time of mourning. Presently we landed on an i&s;eland, kitched &s;ome birds egs but no appetite to eate&mdash;they gave me and the boy &s;ome&mdash;Lying on our bellyes and mourning much, and weeping bitterly; about an hour after we went on the &s;ea, padling along untill we came to a run of water, waided and got over.

then they fireed of their guns, &s;ot up a hol|loing to let their people know off the blody conque&s;t. Their wigwoms appeared and a number of Indians on a point of land. They took me to the Indians wigwam my ma&s;ter, and the boy to an other, about 2 days after they &s;old the boys unto the French; &s;o left alone they herd there was an Englis frigate there in the gut of Cancer, but was not. As for my &s;elf I was obliged to &s;crap their &s;cins&mdash;being con&s;tantly employed. And in a gu&s;t obliged with my burch hatt to &s;tand under the trees, and very wett untill I gott a little furder, where we made a fier and &s;o got &s;ome &s;leep. We came to a little town of Indians, who &s;ot me down dancing and &s;inging again&s;t the &s;un expecting to or not knowing how &s;oone the little ax would com upon my head. But ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord that can deliver by a &s;mall thing as well as a big: a &s;mall &s;hower coming on they went into their wigwoms; but it &s;eemed to me the buchers were re|&s;trained by an invi&s;able power, and did not &s;culp me: ble&s;&s;ed be my mercifull pre&s;erver. So tho&s;e Indians came about 20 in number and toock me away by fors, but the old In|dians would have me &s;culped, as &s;one as I got over I ki&s;&s;ed the old Indians hand to &s;how my thankfullnes: but it was the kind pre&s;ervor that &s;howed mercy on me, thanks and prai&s;es be to his holy name. We got to there wigwams about 20 in number

and full of Indiens, I was takeen to mr. Jo&s;ephs and their boy unto cap. John Bap|ti&s;to. I mu&s;t remark the way of keching &s;almon, an Indian and &s;qua would go with theire connow and a flamboy to give light in the water and &s;trike their &s;peer in the &s;almon and ketch 20 or 30 &s;almon, and &s;o divide them among&s;t their familyes &amp;c. When don and koocked them hollowing and rejoycing much I &s;uppose by the way of thank&s;giving. O dear friend many that is rich forgets the poor, fairing &s;umptuo&s;ly every day, what will become of tho&s;e rich? A woman &amp;c. came padling a long &s;hore, I walked up to them and talking to her in Ingli&s;h, my Indien mi&s;tre&s;s came behind me and box|ed my ears &s;evarely. O the ju&s;t judg|ment of my God, ju&s;t and equall in all his di&s;pen&s;ations towards us. Two of the Indiens went to make a bargain for us&mdash;we went on board to fit out the &s;chooner. When we were at their town the Indiens advi&s;ed me to rite to St. Johns which I did, commanded by Adlam, a coppy of a letter &s;orrowing for me much, and advi&s;ed the French to take me to cape Britton, which they did and &s;o gott clear for the bargain the French with the Indians was about &pound;10 &s;terling, but the French demanded &pound;35 for me and the boy, which &s;um Adlam would not pay them and &s;o came home&mdash;his advi&s;e to carry us to cape Brittoon and then the governor would
