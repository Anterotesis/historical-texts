<HEAD>VERSES Occa&s;ioned by the EARTHQUAKES in the Month of November, 1755.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By <HI>Jeremiah Newland.</HI></BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>O God of Mercy thou art good,</L>
<L>Thou Care for us did take,</L>
<L>When by thy Hand thou did Command,</L>
<L>the Earth and Sea to &s;hake.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What Heart &s;o hard that can't be jarr'd,</L>
<L>when thou the Earth doth &s;hake:</L>
<L>O Lord what Eye can then be dry,</L>
<L>in terrible EARTHQUAKE.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thy terrible Hand is on the Land,</L>
<L>by bloody War and Death;</L>
<L>It is becau&s;e we broke thy Laws,</L>
<L>that thou did&s;t &s;hake the Earth.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Is ten good Men in each Town then?</L>
<L>becau&s;e our Towns are &s;par'd!</L>
<L>Ble&s;s God that they have made a Way,</L>
<L>that God might us Regard.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>God looked &s;trait in <HI>Sodom's</HI> Gate,</L>
<L>but ten good Men were not;</L>
<L>But yet we &s;ee he did agree,</L>
<L>with <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Lot.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>God would be ju&s;t if he had thru&s;t</L>
<L>us in the gaping Ground;</L>
<L>When we did &s;hake by the Earthquake,</L>
<L>clean is his guiltle&s;s Throne.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come to the Lord with one Accord,</L>
<L>and forth his Prai&s;es &s;ound;</L>
<L>For &s;eeing he &s;o kind to thee,</L>
<L>and not to &s;ink the Ground.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For by God's Hand, <HI>New-England</HI></L>
<L>was &s;pared from much hurt;</L>
<L>Tho' &s;ome buildings he down did fling,</L>
<L>and lev'led with the durt.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We &s;ee O Lord, that thou ha&s;t jarr'd</L>
<L>mo&s;t every Habitation;</L>
<L>By that we know, thou'rt &s;trong enough</L>
<L>to &s;ink the whole Creation.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let every Tongue, both Old and Young,</L>
<L>and every Nation prai&s;e</L>
<L>The God of Ho&s;t and Holy Gho&s;t, for Chri&s;t, his Saints will rai&s;e.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>By rending Rocks and by Earth Shocks,</L>
<L>graves open by Direction;</L>
<L>The Saints aro&s;e and that to &s;ee</L>
<L>our Saviour's Crucifixion.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The old mu&s;t dye, you can't deny,</L>
<L>the young he doth command;</L>
<L>The middle-age when death engage,</L>
<L>though &s;trong, yet can't with&s;tand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What Age or Sect will then neglect,</L>
<L>a Pardon for to &s;eek;</L>
<L>When God hath told the Young and Old</L>
<L>as plain as Words can &s;peak.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then do not &s;ay old People may</L>
<L>be e'er too old for Death;</L>
<L>For it is &s;ent in a Moment,</L>
<L>'twill &s;natch away their Breath.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then O young Man, don't &s;ay you can</L>
<L>your &s;elf from Death deliver;</L>
<L>Your Fathers &s;urely now are dead;</L>
<L>Can Prophets live for ever?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O how can we who &s;inners be</L>
<L>expect a dwelling here?</L>
<L>When God doth call, both great and &s;mall</L>
<L>to Judgment mu&s;t appear.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What &s;hall I &s;ay, of Youth, I pray;</L>
<L>O! Can they Conquer Death?</L>
<L>For when it goes with deadly Blows,</L>
<L>'twill &s;trike away their Breath.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There comes a Day, the Scriptures &s;ay,</L>
<L>when every Tribe mu&s;t meet,</L>
<L>To &s;ee the Judge of Quick and Dead,</L>
<L>at his Tribunal Seat.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O what a Day the Scriptures &s;ay,</L>
<L>the EARTHQUAKE doth foretell;</L>
<L>O turn to God, le&s;t by his Rod,</L>
<L>he ca&s;t thee down to Hell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Mountains like Rams &amp; Hills like Lambs,</L>
<L>they Skipping till declin'd;</L>
<L>The Rocks then clifts &s;o fa&s;t,</L>
<L>no Shelter could I find.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Where &s;hall I run for Shelter then,</L>
<L>but unto Chri&s;t my Rock,</L>
<L>And pray that he will Shelter me</L>
<L>among&s;t his cho&s;en Flock.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That I might &s;tand at Chri&s;t's right Hand</L>
<L>the Day of Great A&s;&s;ize;</L>
<L>And &s;ing mo&s;t &s;weet and fly to meet,</L>
<L>my Je&s;us in the Skies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O God of Grace &s;hine on my Face,</L>
<L>The Beams of Glory &s;hine;</L>
<L>That I might Sing to Chri&s;t my King,</L>
<L>when he &s;ays I am thine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then do attend, O Lord and &s;end,</L>
<L>thy <HI>Jonah</HI> unto us;</L>
<L>That he may Preach and ever Teach,</L>
<L>and take away the Cur&s;e.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then give us Space and give us Grace,</L>
<L>that we may give thee prai&s;e;</L>
<L>We know not but we &s;hall be &s;unk</L>
<L>in le&s;s than forty Days.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ble&s;&s;ed be God that I have trod</L>
<L>the Earth that might have fell;</L>
<L>For it is he that maketh me,</L>
<L>in Safety for to dwell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Lord guide our Way in every Day,</L>
<L>and give us Hearts of Prayer;</L>
<L>That &s;o we may not go the Way</L>
<L>into the Devil's Snare.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Pardon the Sin we was born in,</L>
<L>that's the Original;</L>
<L>And keep us from the Way that goes</L>
<L>into the Gate of Hell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And let O Lord, thy Spirit guard,</L>
<L>our Bodies Day and Night;</L>
<L>Thou might mo&s;t ju&s;tly cut us off,</L>
<L>and ca&s;t us out of Sight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Lord hath told he can't behold,</L>
<L>the Face of a Deceiver;</L>
<L>But he delights and &s;o invites</L>
<L>the penitent Believer.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If you deceive and can't believe,</L>
<L>you &s;urely then &s;hall feel,</L>
<L>The Weight of Wrath the Cur&s;e for Sloth,</L>
<L>that God will then reveal.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Believe I pray what God did &s;ay,</L>
<L>the Words are of his Mouth;</L>
<L>For what he &s;aid he'll make it good,</L>
<L>he &s;ware it with an Oath.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ble&s;t three in one, Father and Son,</L>
<L>the Holy Gho&s;t, thy Spirit;</L>
<L>Becau&s;e that he's the way to thee,</L>
<L>tho' he's not our Merit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And O therefore we mu&s;t adore</L>
<L>our <HI>Je&s;us</HI> for his Merit;</L>
<L>For 'tis by the Eternal three,</L>
<L>the Father, Son and Spirit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And pray that he would take from thee</L>
<L>if it &s;hould be his Will;</L>
<L>That heavy Judgment which he &s;ent,</L>
<L>and &s;end us Mercies &s;till.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let every knee, Lord bow to thee,</L>
<L>and every Tongue confe&s;s;</L>
<L>That thou art Lord, and by thy Word,</L>
<L>do&s;t Judge in Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Take away Sin that cur&s;ed thing,</L>
<L>in which we did delight:</L>
<L>Make us a People near to God,</L>
<L>and form our Spirits Right.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let us in Time, whil&s;t we have Prime,</L>
<L>for to be getting Store:</L>
<L>Whil&s;t in our Health, for to get Wealth</L>
<L>that la&s;t for ever more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Dont covet more, nor cheat the Poor,</L>
<L>dont &s;corn thy Enemies;</L>
<L>For what you get, by fal&s;e deceit,</L>
<L>wi&s;dom calls vanity.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If you be great in your E&s;tate,</L>
<L>'twill lead you in a &s;nare;</L>
<L>The little that the poor Man gets</L>
<L>is Ble&s;&s;ed, tho' he's Poor.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Dont think that we more Righteous be,</L>
<L>becau&s;e we did E&s;cape:</L>
<L>Altho' &s;ome Towns were totter'd down,</L>
<L>when as the Earth did Shake.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let us not &s;tand at Babels hand,</L>
<L>Let's not a Tower have;</L>
<L>Le&s;t we come down unto the Ground,</L>
<L>and loo&s;e our Language then.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O <HI>Je&s;us!</HI> &s;end Angels to tend</L>
<L>and fetch us home from far;</L>
<L>That we may run to that bright Sun</L>
<L>which is the Morning Star.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And &s;o O Lord, &s;end forth thy word,</L>
<L>into our inward Parts:</L>
<L>And write a Law of Gratitude,</L>
<L>and &s;et it on our Hearts.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Don't when you look de&s;pi&s;e the&s;e Lines,</L>
<L>tho' you may the inditer,</L>
<L>Becau&s;e my Tongue, is not like one</L>
<L>that is a ready Writer.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And do not look upon the&s;e Lines,</L>
<L>to make a merry Story;</L>
<L>But when you read do then proceed,</L>
<L>to give to God the Glory.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then let us join with one De&s;ign,</L>
<L>our thankful Voices rai&s;e;</L>
<L>And &s;ing to him that dy'd for Sin,</L>
<L>who's worthy of our Prai&s;e.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For in his Face &s;hines Beams of Grace,</L>
<L>a Pardon hath in Store;</L>
<L>He dy'd for Sin and ro&s;e again,</L>
<L>who lives for Evermore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And don't I &s;ay forget that Day,</L>
<L>the Eighteenth of <HI>November;</HI></L>
<L>On Tue&s;day Morn the Lord did warn,</L>
<L>let us always remember.</L>
