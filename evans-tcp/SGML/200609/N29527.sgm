I do direct and Command, all Iudges, Iu&s;tices of Peace, Grand-jurors, Con&s;tables, Tything-men, and all other Officers and Per&s;ons, in their re&s;pective Capacities, to do all that in them lies to detect di&s;cover, and bring forth all per&s;ons tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing and offending again&s;t the whole&s;ome Laws and Statutes made and provided for the Suppre&s;&s;ing and puni&s;hing of Exce&s;&s;ive Drinking, Bla&s;phemy, prophane Swearing and Cur&s;ing, Lewdne&s;s, prophanation of the Lords Day, and other di&s;&s;olute Immortal and di&s;orderly practices; and to take effectual care, that the Laws made again&s;t &s;uch, be Vigorou&s;ly put in Execution; as they tender the Honour of Almighty GOD, and the welfare, pro&s;perity &amp; quiet of them&s;elves and their Neighbourhood: And that by the piety and virtue of their own Lives &amp; Conver&s;ations, they do &s;et good Examples, to incite others to a de&s;irable Imitation thereof. Ordering that this Proclamation be Read in all Courts of Iu&s;tice within this Province, at the opening thereof, immediately before the charge be given to the Grand-jury.</P>
