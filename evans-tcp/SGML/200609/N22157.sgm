<P>Have you any thing more to expect from your fair dulcinea?</P>

<SP>

<P>Nothing more from her I fear: but my rival! I have something to expect from him, I'll tell you the sequel&mdash;while I lay in amorous pastime, with this Venus, encircling, in pops a stranger, not know|ing who could thus intrude, I requested of the lady <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o chide him; who, when she beheld shrieked aloud! he was the very person she thought then in her arms. I sprung from my downy repast, and bolted the door, which had been neglected; by my rival's assistance the lady had partly recovered her scattered senses.

She entreated of us both to make our escape, for fear we should be discovered, and put one way there was left for flight.</P>

</SP>
<SP>

<P>Did you learn the name of your rival?</P>

<P>His name is Signior Lorenzo. When we

reached the shore, he demanded satisfaction; I told him I knew of now insult offered, I thought there|fore no satisfaction requisite; but that I would every day run the same risk, to be rewarded thus at night.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you have promised to fight him?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wal.</SPEAKER>
<P>This morning at six o'clock.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>'Tis a barbarous custom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wal.</SPEAKER>
<P>What serious again?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen.</SPEAKER>
<P>That honor sanctions, but morality more wise, more just, condemns. What a mistaken sense of honor; what votary's of vice. What toil, what peril do parents undergo for their progeny? Is this filial reverencial gratitude? the pride of the fond doating sire, and matrons tender care; a mind of many years cultivation; is matured to benefit society; for one rash step falls a voluntary sacr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">fice, and leaves to endless inconsolable misery the fountain of his existence.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Think you Harry I am wrong? I am in|deed sorry if you do, but I know you are my friend, and would not willingly do me wrong. Think you I would unnecessarily plunge myself in danger, or a living creature on earth? when impetuous, foolish men for a trivial amour, will set a fellow creatures life in an awful b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">llance, which reclining either way, may prove fatal to one or both, think you the omni|potent would prosper a wretch so baneful? Oh no indignant fate would pronounce sentence aloud, and hurl the unnatural aggressor to perdition.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hen,</SPEAKER>
<P>That is weighty reasoning.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Wal.</SPEAKER>
<P>Could I with honour decline the combat, I would willingly indeed&mdash;but to be branded with a coward's name, I would not disgrace my country so. No American yet has disgraced our annals by in|glorious cowardice; nor shall it be said, that one o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
