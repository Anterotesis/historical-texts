<OPENER>To Lord BOSTON, and the Remnant of the Actors, Merry Andrews, and &s;trolling Players, in Bo&s;ton, Lord KIDNAPPER, and the re&s;t of the Pirates and Buccaneers, and the innumerable and never-ending Clan of Macs and Donalds upon Donalds,in <HI>America.</HI></OPENER>

<P>UNDERSTANDING you are va&s;tly fond of plays and farces, and frequently exhibit them for your own amu&s;ement, and the laudable purpo&s;e of ridiculing your ma&s;ters (the <HI>Yankees,</HI> as you call'em) it was ex|pected you would have been polite enough to have favoured the world, or America at lea&s;t, (at who&s;e expence you act them) with &s;ome of your play-bills, or with a &s;ample of your compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>I &s;hall however not copy your churli&s;hne&s;s, but dedicate the following Tragi-Comedy to your patronage, and for your future entertainment; and as the mo&s;t of you have already acted your particular parts of it, both comic and tragic, in reality at Lexington, Bunker's-hill, the Great-Bridge, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. to the very great applau&s;e of your|&s;elves, tho' not of the whole hou&s;e, no doubt you will pre|&s;erve the marks, or memory of it, as long as you live, as it is wrote in capital American characters and letters of blood on your po&s;teriors: And however &s;ome Whigs may cen&s;ure you for your affected mirth (as they term it, in the deplorable &s;ituation you are now in, like hogs in a pen, and in want of elbow room) yet I can by no means agree with them, but think it a proof of true heroi&s;m and philo|&s;ophy, to endeavour to make the be&s;t of a bad bargain, and laugh at your&s;elves, to prevent others from laughing at you; and though you are deprived of the u&s;e of your teeth,

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>SOLOMON &s;aid, "Oppre&s;&s;ion makes a wi&s;e man mad:" but what would he have &s;aid had he lived in the&s;e days, and &s;een the oppre&s;&s;ion of the people of Bo&s;ton, and the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation of the inhabitants of Charle&s;town, Falmouth, Stonnington, Bri&s;tol, Nor|folk, &amp;c Would he not have &s;aid,
<Q>The tongue of the &s;ucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thir&s;t; the young children a&s;k for bread, but no man breaketh it unto them?</Q>
<Q>They that did feed delicately peri&s;h in the &s;treets; they that were brought up in &s;carlet, embrace the dung.</Q>
What would he have &s;aid of rejected petitions, di&s;regarded &s;upplications, and contemned remon&s;trances? Would he not have &s;aid,
<Q>From hardne&s;s of heart, good Lord, deliver us?</Q>
What would he have &s;aid of a freeborn people butchered&mdash;their towns de&s;olated, and become an heap of a&s;hes&mdash;their inhabitants become beggars, wanderers and vagabonds&mdash;by the cruel orders of an unrelenting tyrant, wallowing in luxury, and wantonly wa&s;ting the people's wealth, to oppre&s;s them the more? Would he not have &s;aid, it was oppre&s;&s;ion and ingrati|tude in the highe&s;t degree, exceeding the oppre&s;&s;ion of the children of I&s;rael? and, like Mo&s;es, have cried out, let the people go? Would he not have wondered at our patience and long-&s;uffering, and have &s;aid, 'Tis time to change our ma&s;ter!&mdash;'Tis time to part!&mdash;And had he been an American born, would he not have &s;hewed his wi&s;dom by adopting the language of independency? Happy then for America in the&s;e fluctuating times, &s;he is not without her Solomons, who &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of hearkening to rea&s;on, and li&s;tening to the voice of COMMON SENSE.</P>

<P>Yes, Roger; and now you put me in mind of it, I'll tell you of &s;omething &s;urpri&s;ing in my turn: I have an old ram and an old ewe, that, whenever they &s;ing Yankee Doodle together, a &s;kilful mu&s;ician can &s;carcely di&s;tingui&s;h it from the ba&s;s and tenor of an organ.</P>

<P>Surpri&s;ing indeed, Dick, nor do I in the lea&s;t doubt it; and why not, as well as Balaam's a&s;s, &s;peak? and I may add, many other a&s;&s;es, now-a-days; and yet, how might that mu&s;ic be improved by a judicious di&s;|po&s;ition of its various parts, by the addition of a pro|per number of &s;heep and young lambs; 'twould then likewi&s;e re&s;emble the counter, counter-tenor, treble, and fine&s;t pipes of an organ, and might be truly called nature's organ; methinks, Dick, I could forever fit and hear &s;uch mu&s;ic,</P>

<SPEAKER>Dick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Delightful, indeed! I'll attempt it with what little &s;kill I have in mu&s;ic; we may then defy the&s;e wolves to imitate it, and thereby &s;ave our flocks: I am well convinced, Roger, the&s;e wolves intended it rather as a decoy than by way of ridicule, becau&s;e they live by cunning and deception; be&s;ides, they could never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> to ridicule a piece of mu&s;ic, a tune, of which &s;uch brutes cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to be judges, and, which is allowed by the be&s;t ma&s;ters of mu&s;ic to be a compo&s;ition of the mo&s;t &s;ubli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> kind, and would have done honour to a Handel or a C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rrellius.

<P>When they came to Lexington, where a flock of our innocent &s;heep and young lambs, as u&s;ual, were feeding and &s;porting on the plain, the&s;e dogs of violence and rapine with haughty &s;tride advanc'd, and berated them in a new and unhear'd-of language to us.</P>

<P>Not content with this, their murdering lead|ers, with premeditated malice, keen appetite, and with|out provocation, gave the howl for the on&s;et, when in&s;tantly the whole herd, as if the devil had entered in|to them, ran violently down the hill, and fixed their talons and jaws upon them, and as quick as lightening eight innocent young lambs fell a &s;acrifice to their fury, and victims to their rapacity; the very hou&s;es of our God were no longer a &s;anctuary; many they tore to pieces, and &s;ome at the very foot of the altar; others were dragged out as in a wanton game&s;ome mood.</P>

<P>Barbarity inexpre&s;&s;ible! more than &s;avage cruelty! I hope you'll make their ma&s;ter pay for 'em; there is a law of this province, Roger, which obliges the owner of &s;uch dogs to pay for the mi&s;chief they do.</P>

<P>One Lord Paramount; they call him a free-booter; a fellow who pretends to be proprietor of all America, and &s;ays he has a deed for it, and chief ranger of all the flocks, and pretends to have a patent for it; has been a long time in the practice of killing and &s;teal|ing &s;heep in England and Ireland, and had like to have been hang'd for it there, bur was reprieved by the means of his friend GEORGE&mdash;I forgot his other name&mdash;not Grenville&mdash;not George the Second&mdash;but another George&mdash;</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nor was their voracious appetites &s;atiated there; they ru&s;h'd into the town of Concord, and proceeded to devour every thing that lay in their way; and tho&s;e brute devils, like Samp&s;on's foxes (and as tho' they were

<P>Of &s;ome part of their ha&s;ty retreat I was a joy|ful &s;pectator, I &s;aw their tongues lolling out of their mouths, and heard them pant like hunted wolves indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you not hear how their mirth was turn'd into mourning? their fury into a&s;toni&s;hment? how &s;oon they qitted their howling Yankee Doodle, and chang'd their notes to bellowing? how nimbly (yet again&s;t their will) they betook them&s;elves to dancing? And he was then the brave&s;t dog that beat time the &s;wifte&s;t, and footed Yankee Doodle the nimble&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dick.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well plea&s;ed, Roger, was I with the chace, and glorious &s;port it was: I oft perceiv'd them tumbling o'er each other heels over head; nor did one dare &s;tay to help his brother&mdash;but, with bloody breech, made the be&s;t of his way&mdash;nor ever &s;topped 'till they were got &s;afe within their lurking holes&mdash;</P>

I am well plea&s;ed with their contents&mdash; all but the behaviour of the haughty Carleton&mdash;to fire upon a flag of truce, hitherto unprecedented, even among&s;t Savages or Algerines&mdash;his cruelty to the pri&s;o|ners is cowardly, and per&s;onal ill treatment of General Montgomery is unbecoming a General&mdash;a Soldier&mdash;and beneath a Gentleman&mdash;and leaves an indelible mark of brutality&mdash;I hope General Montgomery, however, will not follow his example.</P>
