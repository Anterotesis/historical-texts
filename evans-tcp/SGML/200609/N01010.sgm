<L>Your <HI>Epicurus,</HI> and old <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI></L>
<L>With <HI>Theodorus, Bion,</HI> and the Rabble,</L>
<L>And &s;uch like <HI>Athei&s;ts,</HI> I mu&s;t grant to you</L>
<L>Deny'd there was a God as &s;tories &s;hew.</L>
<L><PB N="174" REF="001207_0179_0FB132FC97D8A510">Philo&s;ophy is good, but men abu&s;e it.</L>
<L>When they like tho&s;e old Heathen Authors u&s;e it.</L>
<L>God doth &s;ometimes mens Rea&s;ons darken quite,</L>
<L>For not improving of the means of Light.</L>
<L>To vile affections up God doth them give,</L>
<L>Becau&s;e on Earth, like Brutes, they &s;eem to live.</L>
<L>But though the&s;e natural Sots could not e&s;py,</L>
<L>By all their skill th' eternal Deity,</L>
<L>Yet many thou&s;and <HI>Heathens,</HI> I might &s;how,</L>
<L>By natures light alone did come to know</L>
<L>There was a God, they &s;earched &s;o about</L>
<L>Into Gods Works, they found this God-head out,</L>
<L>For when they gave them&s;eves up &s;eriou&s;ly</L>
<L>To &s;tudy natures Book, and came to pry</L>
<L>Into the cau&s;e of all things here on Earth,</L>
<L>And their effects did clearly &s;ee birth</L>
<L>Or fir&s;t Original of every thing,</L>
<L>From &s;uch an e&s;&s;ence to de&s;cend or &s;pring.</L>
<L>The very Novices in Natures School,</L>
<L>May &s;oon convince that man to be a fool,</L>
<L>Who by the Creatures glory can't di&s;cern</L>
<L>The being of that dreadful Soveraign,</L>
<L>Who did them form and make, for every where</L>
<L>His glorious God-head they to all declare,</L>
<L>Had <HI>I</HI> but time, I would &s;ome pages fill,</L>
<L>To &s;hew to you how that Mans rea&s;on will</L>
<L>Teach him there is a God, for if he mind</L>
<L>The nature of his Soul, this he might find.</L>
<L>Man's Soul is like a &s;pring, or like to fire,</L>
<L>It re&s;teth not aloft, it doth a&s;pire.</L>
<L>And unto <HI>Noah</HI>'s Dove I'll it compare,</L>
<L>God is the Ark&punc; Souls Re&s;t alone is there.</L>
<L><PB N="175" REF="001207_0180_0FB13300E875CDA8">The fle&s;h dams up the &s;pring, quenches de&s;ire,</L>
<L>Keeps out of th' Ark, to which it would retire,</L>
<L>Since I perceive Mans Soul doth &s;earch about</L>
<L>To find &s;ome higher Good and Being out;</L>
<L>Which doth excel all things which are below,</L>
<L>This doth to us Gods glorious being &s;how.</L>
<L>But to conclude this, no man can di&s;own,</L>
<L>God by his Judgments daily is made known.</L>
<L>What &s;ad examples daily do we hear</L>
<L>Of Wrath and Vengeance almo&s;t every where?</L>
<L>Some <HI>Drunkerds</HI> and <HI>Bla&s;phemers</HI> &s;truck down dead,</L>
<L>And others with &s;trange Judgments tortured?</L>
<L>Some have per&s;umed the holy God to dare,</L>
<L>Whom he would not one little minute &s;pare.</L>
<L>If this will not Convince you of your Error,</L>
<L><HI>I</HI> fear you will e're long fall under Terror,</L>
<L>For if you will not now Example take,</L>
<L>God may of you a &s;ad Example make.</L>
<L>Your &s;tate, alas! above all men is &s;ad</L>
<L>Becau&s;e of God you once &s;uch knowledge had,</L>
<L>And of his ways, which now you loath and hate;</L>
<L>O <HI>Sir!</HI> Con&s;ider this your woful &s;tate,</L>
<L>And cry to God, if peradventure He</L>
<L>May give you Grace, whereby your Soul may &s;ee</L>

<L>And turn to God before your days are &s;pent.</L>
