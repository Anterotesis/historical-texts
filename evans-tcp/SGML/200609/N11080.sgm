<HEAD>ARGUMENT.</HEAD>
<P>INTRODUCTORY reflections. A traveller un|dertakes a voyage to Bo&s;ton: arrives in a river of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts: has there a &s;ight of the native Genius of North-America, who pre&s;ents him with a mantle, and acquaints him with its virtue of rendering the wear|er invi&s;ible: de&s;ires him to vi&s;it the town in that &s;tate, and remark the tran&s;actions there. Accordingly he arrives at General Gage's man&s;ion, where are &s;everal other mini&s;terial tools &s;itting in council. The &s;triking familiarity of Gage's temper and conduct to that of Hernando Cortez. Some account of Cortez. and his horrid deva&s;tations in Mexico, &amp;c. The traveller en|ters their junto, and gives an account of the chief members of it, viz. General Gage. Admiral Greaves, General Burgoyne, Lord Percy&punc; General Howe, Capt. Wallace, and a numerous fry of dependents and needy favourites waiting for po&s;ts and e&s;tates in America, as &s;oon as they &s;hall have compelled us to re&s;ign our liber|ties: General Gage's &s;urprize at their &s;everal defeats in New-England and que&s;tions his leaders thereupon. Lord Percy's an&s;wer: Greave's reply to that noble|man: Gage's raillery upon Percy for his nimble re|treat on April 19 1775. Percy's defence of his con|duct on that day&punc; and the rea&s;on of his activity; and de&s;ires them to forget Lexington for the pre&s;ent and

turn their eyes to their late lo&s;s at Bunker's Hill. Ge|neral Howe's &s;peech concerning that action. Bur|goyne's harrangue, with his invectives again&s;t Colonel Grant, who "pledged him&s;elf for the general cowar|dice of all America:" Gage's brief reply; and commu|nicates his intention of purloining cattle from the i&s;lands, and plans that right honourable exploit: but being overcome with &s;leep di&s;mi&s;&s;es his coun&s;ellors: The cutting down the Liberty Tree in Bo&s;ton, and un|timely end of one of the wretches employed in that &s;neaking affair: Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the impri&s;oned citizens in Bo&s;ton: Di&s;&s;ection of a Tory: The traveller leaves Bo&s;ton, and vi&s;its the Provincial Camp; meets the Genius of America again on the way and re&s;igns the mantle, whereby he again becomes vi&s;ible; arrives at the camp: View of the Rifle-men, Virginians, &amp;c. Speech of an American Soldier; his determined re&s;o|lution, which is that of all America, to defend our rights and privileges: Grief that he mu&s;t fight again&s;t our own nation: Mention of Carleton and John&s;on; concludes with a melancholly recital of our pre&s;ent di&s;|tractions, and &s;incere hope of reconciliation with Great-Britain, before a wicked mini&s;try render it too late: Conclu&s;ion.</P>

<L>HOW curs'd the man whom fate's unhappy doom</L>

<L>Whom fate ties down, tho' &s;truggling to be free!</L>
<L>Heaven gave to man this va&s;t extended round,</L>

<L>While civil di&s;cord plumes her &s;naky head,</L>
<L>What &s;treams of human gore mu&s;t yet be &s;hed,</L>
<L>With &s;anguine floods &s;hall My&s;tick's waves be dy'd,</L>
<L>And ting'd&punc; the ocean, with her purple tide,</L>
<L>Enough&mdash; The pro&s;pect fills my heart with woe;</L>
<L>Back to the heart my freezing &s;pirits flow,</L>
<L>No more remains; no more than this, that all</L>
<L>Mu&s;t fight like Romans, or like Romans fall:</L>
<L>O heaven born peace, renew thy wonted charms,</L>
<L>Where Neptune we&s;tward &s;preads his aged arms.</L>
<L>To ho&s;tile lands return an honour'd gue&s;t,</L>
<L>And ble&s;s our crim&s;on &s;hore among the re&s;t;</L>
<L>'Till then may heaven a&s;&s;ert our injur'd claims,</L>
<L>And &s;econd every &s;troke Columbia aims.</L>
<L>Direct our coun&s;els and our leaders &s;way,</L>
<L>Confound our foes and fill them with di&s;may,</L>
<L><PB N="24" REF="014044_0023_0F92AB7BDD2F1D78">So &s;hall pa&s;t years, tho&s;e happy years, return,</L>
<L>And war's red lamp in Bo&s;ton cea&s;e to burn:</L>
<L>Hear and atte&s;t the warme&s;t wi&s;h I bring,</L>
<L>God &s;ave the Congre&s;s and reform the King!</L>
<L>Long May Britannia rule our hearts again,</L>
<L>Rule as &s;he rul'd in George the Second's reign;</L>
<L>May ages hence her growing empire &s;ee,</L>
<L>And &s;he be glorious, but our&s;elves be free,</L>
<L>In that ju&s;t &s;cale an equal balance hold,</L>
<L>And grant the&s;e climes a &s;econd age of gold."</L>

<L>He ceas'd, and now the &s;un's declining beam</L>
<L>With fainter radiance &s;hot a trembling gleam.</L>
<L>The thickening &s;tars proclaim'd the day expir'd,</L>
<L>And to their tented man&s;ions all retir'd.</L>
