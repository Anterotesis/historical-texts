<HEAD>The Carrier of the AMERICAN MERCURY Wishes his Customers a HAPPY NEW-YEAR, And presents the following.</HEAD>
<L>IN the days when old Jupiter held the prime station,</L>
<L>Stood scaleman for empires and weigh'd the creation,</L>
<L>Rais'd whirlwinds and earthquakes, to make the world wonder,</L>
<L>And issued his mandates as well as his thunder,</L>
<L>Swift Merc'ry, his post-boy attended his nod,</L>
<L>And drove thro' the nations in style of a god.</L>
<L>Where e'er he allighted, by sea or by land,</L>
<L>All the word gaz'd around at the wave of his wand;</L>
<L>While by nations rever'd and by monarchs ador'd</L>
<L>And treated with all that each clime could afford,</L>
<L>On business or pleasure he rambled so free,</L>
<L>That no monarch on earth was so mighty as he.</L>
<L>But now since the regions, below and above,</L>
<L>No longer submit to the sceptre of Jove,</L>
<L>His messenger too finds his power so decay'd,</L>
<L>He can hardly find means to continue his trade;</L>
<L>For, depriv'd of his wings and quite useless his feet,</L>
<L>He now without help could ne'er get thro' the street;</L>
<L>While I thro' all weathers am fated to plod,</L>
<L>And bear round the bulk of this narrative god;</L>
<L>Yet the task, tho' severe, I've most cheerfully done.</L>
<L>I return with the week and keep pace with the sun.</L>
<L>And bring you this morn with my wonderful ditty,</L>
<L>The first happy new-year that graced your new city.</L>
<L>Nor think I (ye learned with reverence I speak)</L>
<L>This AMERICAN MERCURY worse than the Greek:</L>
<L>What tho' in his message he tells you no lies,</L>
<L>That he came from above; or that gods leave the skies,</L>
<L>Yet a stranger event he is bold to declare,</L>
<L>How the fortunate Frenchmen have found the way there.</L>
<L>I hope for the future he'll greet your fond ear,</L>
<L>With the glorious events that await the glad year;</L>
<L>That cash may return and our commerce encrease,</L>
<L>And virtue still triumph with plenty and peace,</L>
<L>But since, my kind Reader, my errand is done,</L>
<L>With your leave and your bounty I'll set off and run.</L>
