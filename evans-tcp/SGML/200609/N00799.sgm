<P>IN this Context we have an Hi&s;tory&punc; which is al&s;o recorded in two other, <HI>Evangelists, viz. Matthew,</HI> and <HI>Luke,</HI> though variou&s;ly as to &s;everal&punc; pa&s;&s;ages that are in&s;erted in one, and omitted in the other. I may not &s;pend the time in laying open all the particulars in this Narration; every whereof would afford matter of in&s;truction. The Theological Scope of it is to let us &s;ee how far a natural man may go in the improvement of his <HI>Moral powers,</HI> and yet mi&s;s of eternal life at la&s;t; exemplified in a young and noble man of the Jewi&s;h Nation, as he is repre&s;ented by the other <HI>Evangeli&s;ts.</HI> This man, doubtle&s;s
<PB N="4" REF="000962_0003_0FADE59031F12030">
had not only heard of Chri&s;t, but had al&s;o heard him, and been affected with his Preaching; and, being convinced of a future everla&s;ting &s;tate, is concerned how he may <HI>obtain eternal Life</HI> in it: accordingly he comes running to Chri&s;t, expre&s;&s;ing much veneration of him, both in words and ge&s;tures, and propounds to him the mo&s;t important que&s;tion that he could, <HI>viz. How he may come to inherit eternal life</HI>: though, in the manner of his enquiry, he expre&s;t a legal &s;pirit, and intimated that he hoped to be Saved by doing, <HI>What &s;hall I do, &amp;c.</HI> Our Savi|our treats him courteou&s;ly, and yet clo&s;ely; he giveth him good language, but yet &s;earcheth him; and, knowing the deceitfulne&s;s of his heart, re&s;olves to di&s;cover it to him, and others too. He therefore fir&s;t puts him upon the duties of the <HI>Moral Law,</HI> where he knew that his great pre&s;umption lay, and in which he determined to di&s;cover him; directing him to conformity thereto: the &s;elf Conceited man doth plumply and with great confidence a&s;&s;ert his con&s;tancy in the&s;e ob&s;ervations; that he hath ob&s;erved <HI>all the&s;e from his youth,</HI> and would fain know whe|ther this were not &s;ufficient, or if any thing more were wanting, <HI>Matth.</HI> 19.20. <HI>What lack I yet?</HI> Our Saviour is &s;aid, <HI>ver&s;.</HI> 21. <HI>To look upon him, and love him</HI>; which is not to be under&s;tood of a Divine love, at lea&s;t not of &s;uch as he bears to his own, or &s;uch whom he hath made par|takers

in his grace: but with an humane affecti|on, which is due to ingenuous men, though they be meer morali&s;ts: and therefore, as he was not mi&s;taken in him, &s;o he goes on to de|tect him. That which he &s;ummarily mentions in our <HI>Text</HI> is, that there is a flaw in that which he is &s;o conceited of, that there is &s;omething deficient: and, to let him know what this was, and that he was as yet a &s;tranger at home, and did not know him&s;elf, he puts him upon a trial, in which the naughtine&s;s of his heart pre&s;ently di&s;covered it &s;elf. <HI>Christ</HI> did not openly charge him with fal&s;ehood, as well he might, and tell him that he had not indeed kept one of the&s;e commands aright, but he puts him upon a <HI>Te&s;t</HI> by which he might judge him&s;elf, and di&s;cover how little &s;afety there was in his condition. Out of doubt, this young man was an eminent in|&s;tance of a <HI>Legal Moralist,</HI> and one that had, with a great deal of <HI>Con&s;cience</HI> and <HI>Integrity</HI> en|deavoured an univer&s;al conformity to the Law, not only in the <HI>Ceremonial,</HI> but al&s;o in the <HI>Moral</HI> part of it, and hoped for acceptance and a re|ward on account of his <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> But Chri&s;t detects the deceit; and, though he might have told him that he wanted many things, yet there was one that was the ground of all, and there needed no more to defeat his blooming ex|pectations. In the <HI>Greek</HI> it it, <HI>there is one thing lacking to thee.</HI> And the word &s;ignifies, to <HI>fall

The word u&s;ed in <HI>Luke</HI> 18.22. &s;ignifies that which is <HI>left behind,</HI> or is wanting to compleat a thing, with|out which it remains imperfect, and cannot an&s;wer the end aimed at in it.

<HEAD>QUESTION. What is that one thing the lack whereof will &s;poil the be&s;t Morality in men?</HEAD>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> I &s;hall not here &s;pend time in inve&s;ti|gating the particular flaw which Chri&s;t laid open in this mans Obedience; for it is beyond ju&s;t di&s;pute&punc; that our Saviours de&s;ign in this trial, was to convince him of the nature of his malady, and lead him to the root from which it pro|ceeded; which by &s;uch a proof he laid open: and what that is, we may now make &s;earch after: and, to make way to this, and obviate tho&s;e prejudices, which proud men will wait for an occa&s;ion of, that &s;o they may calumniate our pre&s;ent <HI>Doctrine,</HI> we may pur&s;ue it in the following <HI>Conclu&s;ions.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That moral Obedience is due to God from all mankind.</HI> The Jews, when the Go&s;pel was pub|li&s;hed, were ready to charge Evangelical Preaching as if it made void the Law, which the Apo&s;tle utterly denies, and a&s;&s;erts the quite con|trary, <HI>Rom.</HI> 3.31. <HI>Do we make void the law through faith? God forbid: ye we e&s;tabli&s;h the law.</HI> The moral Law was adapted to the nature of man, as he was placed under the &s;pecial Govern|ment of God. When God &s;peaks of the Ceremonial law, he u&s;eth &s;uch a word as that, <HI>Ezek.</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="000962_0007_0FADE59317F2EF88">
20.25. <HI>I gave them &s;tatutes that were not good.</HI> Not as if they were not good in re&s;pect of the u&s;e which they were appointed for, for that would have been an impeachment of Gods wi&s;|dom: but they were &s;uch as in them&s;elves bind an heavy and in&s;upportable burden upon tho&s;e who were under the obligation of them, <HI>Acts</HI> 15.10. <HI>A yoke which neither we, nor our fathers were able to bear</HI>; and they only &s;erved for the time being, which was a &s;tate of Servitude un|der which the Church of God was held, during its nonage; and even then when the&s;e were of force; we are told in, <HI>Heb.</HI> 9 9. <HI>That they could not make him that did the &s;ervice perfect, as per|taining to the Con&s;cience.</HI> Whereas the <HI>Moral Law</HI> was &s;uited to man, and every way proper to his nature, and relation which in it he bare to God, it hath therefore that encomium given to it, which it can never lo&s;e, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.12. <HI>The law is holy, and the commandment holy, and ju&s;t, and good.</HI> The obligation therefore to obedi|ence to this law is perpetual, and the Children of God, though brought under the <HI>New Cove|nant,</HI> do yet owe it; and it lies upon them as a con&s;tant duty, to &s;tudy and endeavour after the greate&s;t <HI>perfection</HI> in it, according to Chri&s;ts own precept given in, <HI>Matt.</HI> 5. <HI>ult. Be ye perfect, as your father which is in heaven is perfect.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>That there is a great deal which a man may do in morality, by the improvement of his natural
<PB N="9" REF="000962_0008_0FADE593D18590B0">
powers, with the common a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Spirit of God.</HI> We are here warily to di&s;tingui&s;h be|tween the <HI>Moral Powers</HI> which belong to the nature of man, and the <HI>Moral Image</HI> which was connatural to him in his &s;tate of integrity: this latter indeed is lo&s;t by the <HI>Apo&s;ta&s;y,</HI> but the for|mer abides, as belonging e&s;&s;entially to Humani|ty, though this is very much crazed, and hath lo&s;t a great deal of its vigour. And, although the power of lu&s;t be &s;o &s;trong in natural men, that they cannot of them&s;elves alone with&s;tand the impetuo&s;ity of it, yet the <HI>Moral Powers</HI> which remain in the man, may be &s;o far improved by the common influences of the Spirit of God, which he affords to &s;ome, on whom he doth not be&s;tow his Sanctifying Grace, as to make a na|tural man to proceed far in compliance with the Law. This may be in&s;tanced more e&s;pecially in four particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>A man may maintain an univer&s;al outward conformity to the letter of the Law, &s;o far as to be blamele&s;s among men.</HI> It is true, he can do no one act of Obedience unto Gods Law, that is entirely &s;o, for &s;uch an act mu&s;t &s;tand forth in all its cau&s;es entirely, which doth altogether exceed the power of any of <HI>Adams</HI> Apo&s;tate race: But he may be careful in his Conver&s;ation, and carry it &s;o <HI>circum&s;pectly</HI> in all his actions that are ex|po&s;ed to the view of men, as to ob&s;erve them, and conform to them with great curiou&s;ne&s;s,
<PB N="10" REF="000962_0009_0FADE59492766508">
according to his under&s;tanding of them. And thus this noble young man mentioned in our <HI>context</HI> was of opinion that he had done, and <HI>Paul</HI> after his Conver&s;ion, when he reflected on his law &s;tate, could a&s;&s;ert that he had lived after this &s;ort, in, <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.6. <HI>Touching the Righteou&s;ne&s;s which is in the law blamele&s;s. i e.</HI> without incur|ring the imputation of Scandal from men.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>He may be very Con&s;cientious in all this.</HI> There is a Con&s;cience active in the natural man; and, though it is defiled with &s;in, as every thing el&s;e in the man is, yet it is capable of being im|proved in him, &s;o as to di&s;cover to, and convince him of the rea&s;on and equity of the&s;e and tho&s;e duties, the bruti&s;hne&s;s and unrea&s;onablene&s;s of &s;uch and &s;uch &s;ins, the moral evil which there is in the&s;e, and the moral goodne&s;s in tho&s;e, &s;o as to oblige him from an inward principle to do this, and ab&s;tain from that. There is a <HI>Moral Integrity</HI> in men, and prevails in &s;ome, that leads them to do things, not <HI>Hypocritically,</HI> but <HI>Con&s;cien|tiou&s;ly.</HI> We may &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Abimelech</HI> to plead to this&punc; for we have no Scripture evidence that he had reached any higher, <HI>Gen.</HI> 20.5. <HI>In the integ|rity of my heart, and innocency of my hands have I done this</HI>&punc; And God herein con&s;ents to the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion, <HI>Ver&s;.</HI> 6. <HI>I know that thou did&s;t this in the integrity of thine heart.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>He may take a great deal of delight in thus doing.</HI> The very <HI>Heathen Morali&s;ts,</HI> who only
<PB N="11" REF="000962_0010_0FADE595B8C09468">
followed the light of nature, could boa&s;t that they found incomparably more of plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction, in the exerci&s;e of their <HI>Vertues,</HI> than the greate&s;t &s;en&s;ualli&s;ts could po&s;&s;ibly do in their fle&s;hly plea&s;ures, and could reject the&s;e with &s;corn for tho&s;e. The <HI>Morali&s;t</HI> doth not put a force upon his whole nature, though he may &s;uppre&s;s &s;ome exorbitant motions of it, when he ab&s;tains from the things that the generality im|merge them&s;elves in, and lives contrary to the current of the times and places he lives in; but he gratifies his <HI>Moral Principles,</HI> when he curbs in the&s;e which are <HI>&s;en&s;ual.</HI> Mens <HI>Affections</HI> work naturally, when they are moved by the impre&s;&s;ions of Rea&s;on in them, for it belongs to the nature of man, that he is a rea&s;onable Crea|ture. God therefore concedes that to men whom he yet reproves as fal&s;e, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 58.2. <HI>They ask of me the ordinances of Justice, they take delight in approaching to God.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>He may do it with an aim at obtaining of eternal life in this way.</HI> Thus the noble young man in&s;tanced in our <HI>Context</HI> &s;eems to have done, ina&s;much as he would know if this would not do. The natural man maintains his cravings after felicity, and hath not lo&s;t his apprehen&s;ions of an eternal &s;tate, and con&s;equently is de&s;irous of &s;etling a permanent happine&s;s, and to this his actions de&s;ignedly tend, how ever he may be mi&s;taken in the <HI>Medium.</HI> He knows that there
<PB N="12" REF="000962_0011_0FADE596281DB6E0">
mu&s;t be a way to this, and he is in &s;earch after it, and makes it his enquiry, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 4.6. <HI>Many there be that &s;ay, who will &s;hew us good?</HI> And the <HI>Legali&s;t</HI> looks upon his own Righteou&s;ne&s;s to be the way, and accordingly he pro&s;ecutes it with &s;uch an aim: yea indeed&punc; this is the very legal Spirit in man, that he thinks to obtain it thus: &s;o it was with the <HI>Jews</HI> in the Apo&s;tles time, <HI>Rom.</HI> 9.32. <HI>They &s;ought Righteou&s;ne&s;s, not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3 <HI>Morality helps the man to be Serviceable to mankind in his Generation.</HI> It is <HI>a gift of God,</HI> for man to be helped to exert the&s;e principles which are in them, and for that rea&s;on is to be acknowledged and not de&s;pi&s;ed. It is &s;ub&s;ervi|ent to Gods <HI>Common Government,</HI> in conducting of the affairs of this lower world; and in this regard a <HI>Moral</HI> man may be &s;aid to be a ble&s;|&s;ing in the place where he lives, and is u&s;eful for the publick benefit; and God makes im|provement of the&s;e for &s;uch an end. If all the world were given up to, and drenched in all manner of Immoralities, there would be no li|ving for mankind one with another, but the whole world would &s;oon be reduced to a <HI>Chaos,</HI> whereas this fits the man for publick Service; &s;uch an one was <HI>Saul,</HI> by virtue of tho&s;e com|mon gifts that God be&s;towed on him, when he was made King over <HI>I&s;rael</HI>; and he continued &s;o to be, till <HI>the Spirit of God departed from him.</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="000962_0012_0FADE596D276C6B0">
Such an one may be helpful to the Children of God; and that both by his coun&s;el, and his example, and &s;o was <HI>Achitophel</HI> to <HI>David,</HI> before he went off in <HI>Ab&s;aloms</HI> Rebellion, P&s;al. 55.13, 14. <HI>Mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance; we took &s;weet coun&s;el together, and walked to the Hou&s;e of God in company.</HI> And doubtle&s;s &s;uch was <HI>Demas</HI> to <HI>Paul,</HI> before he for&s;ook him.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>There are many pre&s;ent outward advantages that the man may gain to him&s;elf by it.</HI> There are &s;everal benefits which in this life men get by their morality, in the ordinary cour&s;e of Gods Providence. The man hereby maintains his credit or reputation among men; it wins the good word of all that are &s;ober; whereas im|morality expo&s;eth men to be the &s;corn of all, but tho&s;e that are their companions in debauch|ery. It keeps the man from tho&s;e cour&s;es which would of their own nature prove ruinous to him, in re&s;pect of his e&s;tate, peace, health and life. It gives the man more quiet of Con&s;cience, and prevents tho&s;e horrors which immoral men draw upon them&s;elves by their &s;inning again&s;t the light that is in them: for the Con&s;cience of a Legali&s;t is wont ordinarily to treat him according as it hath re&s;entments of his carriage towards the Law which is imprinted upon it, <HI>Rom</HI> 2.14, 15. <HI>The&s;e are a law to them&s;elves, which &s;hew the work of the Law written upon their hearts; their con&s;ciences al&s;o bearing witne&s;s, and
<PB N="14" REF="000962_0013_0FADE599B9D89FD0">
their thoughts mean while, either accu&s;ing or el&s;e excu&s;ing one another.</HI> And it procures the man many temporal ble&s;&s;ings from God in the cour&s;e of his common Providence; Men fare the bet|ter in this world oftentimes for this: for tho' meer <HI>Morality</HI> doth not procure Gods &s;pecial love for men, yet the <HI>Morality</HI> it &s;elf is &s;o far a duty, and God many times favours men in temporary benefits on the account hereof; and it prevents calamities which otherwi&s;e might have overtaken them: hence that advice given, <HI>Eccle&s;.</HI> 7.17. <HI>Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou fooli&s;h, why &s;houlde&s;t thou dy before thy time?</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>The Moral Obedience of the Children of God, is Serviceable to their Eternal Felicity.</HI> The truth of this a&s;&s;ertion is que&s;tioned by none but &s;uch as are downright <HI>Antinomian</HI>; though, how far, and after what manner it is &s;o, affords occa&s;ion for hot di&s;putes. There is a moral Righteou&s;|ne&s;s, the want whereof will exclude a man from the Kingdom, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.20. <HI>Except your righ|teou&s;ne&s;s exceed the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, ye &s;hall in no ca&s;e enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI> There is a <HI>Holine&s;s, without which no man &s;hall &s;ee God, Heb.</HI> 12.14. This is &s;o far from being di&s;charged by the Go&s;pel Cove|nant, that it teacheth it, <HI>Tit.</HI> 2.11, 12. <HI>The Grace of God which brings Salvation, hath appeared to all men; teaching us that denying ungodline&s;s and world|ly lu&s;ts, we &s;hould live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godly
<PB N="15" REF="000962_0014_0FADE59AD5957F58">
in this pre&s;ent world.</HI> There are therefore many and great promi&s;es made in the Go&s;pel to the faithful obedience of the Children of God: 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15. <HI>ult. Knowing that your labour &s;hall not be in vain, in the Lord. Gal</HI> 6.9. <HI>Be not weary of well doing, for in due time you &s;hall reap if you faint not.</HI> Rev. 2.10. <HI>Be thou faithful unto the death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life</HI>; Rom. 2.7. <HI>To them that by patient continuance in well doing, &s;eek for glory, honour, and immortality, eternal life.</HI> Far be it from any to think, that the Go&s;pel doth either give men a di&s;charge from the du|ty of Obedience to Gods Commands, or that it doth not encourage it with the promi&s;e of eternal rewards.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>But meer morality will leave the man &s;hort of Eternal Life, and under the Cur&s;e of E|ternal Death.</HI> All men in their natural &s;tate are under the Cur&s;e, <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.3. <HI>Were children of wrath by nature, even as others.</HI> And whiles this abides on them, they mu&s;t needs be far from life, for the&s;e two are contraries. In vain then do men &s;eek any other cour&s;e to advance their everla&s;t|ing welfare, but &s;uch as may re&s;cue them from that Cur&s;e. That man cannot be le&s;s than mi|&s;erable on whom the Wrath of God abides; Chri&s;t therefore &s;o expre&s;&s;eth &s;inful mans mi&s;e|ry, Joh. 3.36. <HI>The wrath of God abideth on him.</HI> The man al&s;o mu&s;t be put into the way of life, if ever he obtain it, but meer morality will not
<PB N="16" REF="000962_0015_0FADE59B5C489DA8">
do this, but leave him infinitely &s;hort of it, as will pre&s;ently appear.</P>

to the precept, &s;hould he &s;ay true, that he doth to his utmo&s;t, it &s;ignifieth nothing, as long as that is &s;hort of the command.

<P N="2">2. <HI>The Apo&s;ta&s;y hath made man a debtor to Re|venging Ju&s;tice, for which his per&s;onal Obedience cannot &s;atisfy.</HI> The Covenant of Works, un|der which man was at fir&s;t placed, had not only in it, a promi&s;e of <HI>life</HI> made to perfect Obedience, but al&s;o a threatning of <HI>death</HI> de|nounced in ca&s;e of Di&s;obedience.

Once God &s;aid, <HI>This do, and live</HI>; but he doth not &s;ay &s;o now; for the man is come &s;hort of this, being by &s;in fallen under the threatning, and is utterly lo&s;t as to the promi&s;e; &s;o that not only is it in vain for him to think to <HI>do and live,</HI> in regard of that impotency which is fallen upon him, leav|ing him <HI>without &s;trength</HI>; but upon the &s;uppo&s;al that he could now henceforward do, as perfect|ly as <HI>Adam</HI> could before he lo&s;t his power, yet there is no life for him by that Covenant, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.21. <HI>If there had been a law given which could have given life</HI>; (i. e. <HI>to fallen man) verily righte|ou&s;ne&s;s &s;hould have been by the Law.</HI> And the rea&s;on is, becau&s;e a Cur&s;e is upon him for di&s;o|bedince; and all his doing can never expiate it; it is but his pre&s;ent quit rent, and will not

<P N="3">3. <HI>The acceptablene&s;s of the imperfect obedience of &s;inful men, is derived through a New-Covenant, to which the Morali&s;t is a stranger.</HI> Though the Fir&s;t Covenant accepted of nothing but what was in all points perfect, yet the Covenant of Grace doth. It is certain that there are &s;ome who&s;e not only <HI>per&s;ons</HI> but <HI>&s;ervices</HI> too are re|ceived by God, and he &s;mells a &s;weet &s;avour in them. This is not becau&s;e they have recovered a &s;inle&s;s perfection, or that any of their duties are without defects attending them; no; they profe&s;s the quite contrary, &s;o did he, <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.12. <HI>Not as if I had already attained, either were alrea|dy perfect</HI>; and hence is fain to deprecate a law trial, as knowing that he is not able to &s;tand it, but it will condemn him, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 143.2. <HI>Enter not into judgment with thy &s;ervant, for in thy &s;ight &s;hall no man living be ju&s;tifyed.</HI> For this acceptance therefore he mu&s;t be removed from the Old Covenant, which &s;peaks nothing but terror to him, and be brought under a new one; which is therefore called, <HI>the bringing in of a better hope, Heb.</HI> 7.19. This Covenant hath declared a way which God hath found out to cover the imper|fections, and accept of the &s;incerity of &s;uch as are
<PB N="21" REF="000962_0020_0FADE59F13125300">
in it, con&s;i&s;tent with the Ju&s;tice of God, and for the manife&s;tation of his <HI>Grace.</HI> Now the moral man, as &s;uch, hath no claim to the &s;piri|tual and &s;aving priviledges of this Covenant, nor doth he de&s;ire it, counting that he can do well enough without it; however he may, by an external relation, have a claim to Go&s;pel priviledges in the outward di&s;pen&s;ation of them; yet he is really under the Law, and therefore mu&s;t &s;tand or fall according to the &s;entence of it.</P>
<P N="4">4 <HI>In this Covenant there is a new principle requi|&s;ite, from which all acceptable Obedience mu&s;t flow, viz. Faith.</HI> We are told, in <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.6. <HI>That without faith it is impo&s;&s;ible to plea&s;e God.</HI> And hence, all the truly commendable and accptable &s;ervices, are &s;aid to be done <HI>by Faith.</HI> For this therefore it is nece&s;&s;ary that not only there be a principle of &s;aving &s;aith in the man, el&s;e he can do nothing believingly, but there mu&s;t be the exerting of it in every act of New obedience, if ever God will receive it. A man may pray as formally, and u&s;e as &s;uitable and pathetical ex|pre&s;&s;ions in it as can be, but if he do not pray in faith, all is lo&s;t, and his prayers are but <HI>how|lings</HI>: hence that direction and caution, <HI>Jam.</HI> 1.5, 6, 7. <HI>Let him ask of God; but let him ask in faith, nothing wavering; for let not &s;uch a man think that he &s;hall receive any thing of the Lord</HI>; and <HI>Mat.</HI> 21.22. <HI>All things what&s;oever ye &s;hall
<PB N="22" REF="000962_0021_0FADE59FE9202320">
ask in prayer, believing, ye &s;hall receive.</HI> A per&s;on may hear the word with great attention, and receive it with much affection, <HI>the &s;tony ground hearers, reeeived it with joy, Mat.</HI> 13.20. But it will not <HI>profit him,</HI> unle&s;s he <HI>receive it mixed with faith, Heb</HI> 4.2. And the like may be &s;aid of all other duties.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>This faith hath Christ for its object, on whom it entirely relies for Salvation.</HI> As <HI>we are &s;aved by grace,</HI> &s;o it is <HI>through faith, Eph.</HI> 2.8. And with|out this faith there is no Salvation to be obtain|ed by us, for <HI>he that believeth not &s;hall be damned, Mark</HI> 16.16. Which faith is not a bare credit of the truths recorded in the Word of God, &amp; tho&s;e Theological Doctrines that are revealed therein, though this al&s;o be nece&s;&s;ary unto it; but it centers upon Chri&s;t as the object that is therein revealed, and offered in the promi&s;e, on whom it placeth its whole dependance for life and &s;alvation; and is therefore called <HI>a believing in him,</HI> and to the &s;o believing, eternal life is &s;e|cured, <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.16. <HI>Who&s;oever believeth in him, &s;hall not peri&s;h, but have everlasting life</HI>; which dependance mu&s;t be limited to him, and not be divided with any other, becau&s;e our &s;alvation is from him alone, <HI>Acts</HI> 4.12. <HI>Neither is there &s;al|vation in any other.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>The influence of this faith into our moral Obe|dience, to render it acceptable unto God, and &s;ervicea|ble to our &s;alvation</HI>: is mainly in the&s;e three re|&s;pects.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="23" REF="000962_0022_0FADE5A34FF06DD8">1. <HI>It makes us &s;en&s;ible of our own &s;elf-in&s;ufficiency, &amp; drives us to Chri&s;t alone, for his &s;trength to enable us.</HI> The Morali&s;t doth all his duties in his own &s;trength, nor is he concerned to &s;eek any out of him&s;elf: but the true believer doth his in the &s;trength of Chri&s;t, he &s;aith as <HI>Paul, Phil.</HI> 4.13. <HI>I can do all things through Chri&s;t that &s;trength|eneth me.</HI> By the eye of faith he &s;ees that as he hath no &s;ufficiency of his own for any thing, &s;o that he mu&s;t have it all from him, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.5. <HI>Not that we are &s;ufficient of our &s;elves, to think any thing as of our &s;elves, but our &s;ufficiency is of God.</HI> He therefore dares not to &s;et about any thing, without looking up to him for his aid: all his undertakings are with &s;uch a reference, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 119.32. <HI>I will run the way of thy Command|ments, when thou &s;halt have enlarged my heart, Cant.</HI> 1.4 <HI>Draw me, we will run after thee.</HI> If he re&s;olves upon any thing, it is with a reliance here, <HI>P&s;al&middot;</HI> 71.16. <HI>I will go in the &s;trength of the Lord God.</HI> And if he doth any thing well, he pays the acknowledgment of it hither, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.10. <HI>Not I, but the Grace of God which was with me.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It convinceth us of the imperfection of our be&s;t duties, &s;o as to remove our dependance on them, and make us to &s;eek a pardon of their &s;hort coming, thro' the blood of Chri&s;t.</HI> Faith makes us apprehen|&s;ive that we can be <HI>accepted only in the beloved Eph.</HI> 1.6.

<P N="7">7. <HI>The legal Moralist is not only a &s;tranger to, but an enemy of this faith.</HI> He acknowledgeth nother faith, but one that is <HI>Hi&s;torical,</HI> and is contained in an <HI>A&s;&s;ent</HI> given to the <HI>Articles</HI> of Religion; as to the faith of <HI>recumbency</HI> on Chri&s;t, he looks upon it as a ridiculous thing, and en|tertains the Doctrine of it with &s;corn.
